 These soldiers included Rohitash Lamba of Rajasthan
 behad garibi main paley-bade rohitash ko CRPF kii vardi paane ke liye kadi mehnat kerani padi
 Rohitash's father says that by sending mud to the MNREGA, he sent money to his son for studies
 agar sarkaar is hamale kaa badla nahin leti he to sarkaar se unka bharosa tut jayega

 Remain silent in loneliness
 ghar par lagane vaale naare rohitash lamba amar rahe se unka dhyaan tuutata he to fafik padate hai
 His dumb eyes question people without saying what was the fault of my son? When will the killers of my son get punished? Go and read in the town and send money by carrying mud, in fact Babulal has raised both his children in extreme poverty
 bete kii kamai par budhapa gujaarne kaa sapana sanjoye babulal bataate hai ki rohitash ko padhane main acha tha
 The shortage of money did not become an obstacle in his studies, so he would work throughout the day
 baad main babulal kaa manaregaa main job card ban gaya
 That is, if the daily wage was guaranteed, he sent his son to study in the nearby city of Chomu
 babulal bataate hai, "maine kaha kasbe main jaakar padhai kar main manaregaa main mitti dhokar paise bhejuungaa
 "recalling his passion to enter the country service, Babulal says that once he had two exams on the same day, he decided to join the army

 Jitendra says that elder brother Saab was not like a brother to him but a father

 Jitendra still remembers his brother's advice
 wo bataata he ki jab bhi vah chuttee main ghar aata to usase kahata tu baitha-baitha motaa ho rahaa he, daud-dhoop kar or sena main bhartee ho ja
 According to wife unconscious, mother Badhwashariport, not many years of Rohitash's marriage have passed

 Sheila's image has been developing in view of the politics of UP
 tanker maamla raajnneeti se prerit bataakar aasaani se isse peechha chhudaaya ja saktaa he
 Also, due to Sheila's age and stature, UP leaders will not have much problem in accepting her
 senior netaaon ko shila se pareshanisutron ke mutabik, party ke varisht netaa shila koyupi main chehrabanane ko aatmghaatee kadam maan rahe hai
 The argument of this camp is that Sheila is a initiated aged, secondly an FIR has been lodged against her
 dilli chunaav main vah buree tarah haar chuki hai
 In such a situation, the opponents will take advantage of this, while a large section of the party's leaders in the state will not accept Sheela from their heart

 Pakistani actor Fawad Khan, who has emerged as a singer, actor and now a style icon, has touched the heights of fame and success in a short span of time
 pakistan main apni adaakaari or good luks ke jariye logon ko divaana banane vaale fawaad khan bharat main bhi bahut kam samay main darshakon ke dilon main apni ek khaas jagah bana chuke hai
 Perhaps this is the reason that every big filmmaker of Bollywood, every big brand and even Indian designers want to work with Fawad
 rajdhani dilli main chal rahe 'india kutyor wyk' menmashhoor dizinermanish malhotra ne apane collection ke liye pehali baar india main fawaad ko ramp par utaara
 Fawad was seen walking the catwalk on the ramp wearing a dark bottle green color sherwani for a collection called 'A Persian Story'
 padhein: miliye fawaad khan kii asli 'humsafar' se
 
 
 Fawad, who walked the ramp for an Indian designer for the first time, was quite nervous before the ramp walk
 unhone bataaya 'mere dil kii dhadkane badi hui thim, ramp kii chakachaundh kar dene vaali lits kaaphi daraa rahi thim
 i never did a ramp walk in India, it was a lot of fun working with the whole team
 'manish malhotra ke jariye dizin kii gaisheravanimen fawaad kaaphi jach rahe the
 But very few people know that Fawad himself considers himself a style icon who makes a different style statement
 fawaad ko apane style kaa divaana banaaya he jaggu dada yani jaiki shroff ne
 Read: Fawad Khan is going to become a father for the second time
 
 
 fawaad ne bataaya 'yun to mujhe kai log pasand hai lekin main jaiki shroff kaa naam yahaan lenaa chaahunga kyonki mujhe lagata he ki fishan ek atitude he aap use jis tarah se pahante hai yaa kairi karte hai wo matter karata he or jaiki vaaki memphationake rockstar hai'
 Fawad's popularity can be gauged from the fact that he will soon be seen sharing screen in the film 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil' with big actors like Aishwarya Rai, Ranbir Kapoor, Anushka Sharma

 What does it really mean? Love for your country, your nation, your motherland? Of course there is some risk in understanding it in pieces, but in fact, without removing the skins of some hair, one cannot even define patriotism correctly
 hamane jane-maane logon se ek prashn poocha, or un sabhi ke paas uske bahut alag-alag uttar the
 Or you could say that they all agreed that it depends on who you are — filmmaker or writer, teacher or soldier, singer or diplomat
 or haalanki ham sabhi bhartiya hi hai, shaayad phir bhi yah myne rakhata he ki aap kahaan se hai—uttar yaa dakshin se, rajdhani se yaa dur-daraaj se, kalakatta se yaa elahabaad sa—kolkata se yaa prayagraj se
 Or from Kashmir
 hamaare is ank ke liye apane vichaar likhane vaale kai logon kaa kahana he ki deshbhakti, rashtrawaad se kaaphi alag he
 Much older, more esoteric and perhaps more authentic
 kuch anya ke mutabik, raashtra hamaari pahchaan kaa pracheen, pramanik strot he
 Does the attraction we feel to our soil make a difference in our loyalty to our 'original place' (or where we actually live) and a national imagination? Or is there an emotional order that Continuing on? Similarly, parochialism, prejudice and hatred for foreigners are dominated by love for the place, which is sometimes up or down in the smallest unit of society of this subcontinent
 bharat kii anekta hi uski aatmsaat karne kii takat bani or isse deshbhakti kaa bilkul alag swaroop nirmit hua jo duniya main or kahin dikhaai nahin detaa
 Indian patriotism is spared from all these contradictions and irony — sometimes it seems to thrive on them
 kisi samay ham ek vyakti main puure bharat kii chhavi dekhne ko prerit the
 But this did not last long
 ek arab deshbhakt koi ek hi naaraa lagaaein, aisi ummid nahin kii jaani chahie
 Celebrate such a celebration of independence as well

 Leader of Opposition in Delhi Legislative Assembly and BJP MLA Vijender Gupta has raised questions that on the one hand the government is claiming to try to take steps towards pollution, even willing to take strict measures like aud-even, but Environment Secretary And he is not serious about filling the post of chairman of Delhi Pollution Control Committee

 Amish Lekhi, counsel for Ashish Nandi, requested for an early hearing on the petition, saying that it required court intervention as there was a possibility of arrest of the sociologist
 ashish nandi ne vakil gaurang kaant ke madhyam se daayar yachika main kaha, ‘praathmiki darj karnaa apane aap main hi kanoon kaa durupyog he or is baat kaa khatra he ki yachikakarta ko samvidhan ke anuchhed 14, 19 or 21 main pradutt moulik adhikaron se vanchit kar diya jaayegaa kyonki mayawati or anusuchit jati evam janajati ayog ke adhyaksh pi el punia sahit mahatvapurn raajnneetik hastiyaan unki turant giraftaar kii maang kar rahi hai

 Challenging this action, the 78-year-old prominent political sociologist has said that he faces a grave danger in the environment against him

 The petition said that filing an FIR against the petitioner for alleged crime under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Act is against the fundamental principle of fundamental rights in which freedom of expression is the foundation of a democratic society

 Recently something has happened to RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav in Karnataka, after which he has become ashamed of being Bihari
 bihar ke purv up mukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ne khud puri ghatana ko apane twitor handle par saajha kiya he
 Through this, he also targeted Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar

 Being a Bihari but not a politician, it was bad to hear this

 RJD leader Yadav said, 'I was unafraid to hear all this
 ek politician nahin, balki ek bihari hone ke naate yah sunakar bura laga
 According to him, during the swearing-in of Kumaraswamy, people said this to him because last year Nitish Kumar broke away from the congress-rjd grand alliance and formed an alliance with the BJP and then formed the government
 jediu ne tejasvi yadav par kiya palatvaravahin, argedy netaa tejasvi yadav ke is hamale par jediu ne palatwaar kiya he

 The BJP has been working for a long time on the strategy of encircling the Congress in its strongholds - Amethi and Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh
 jabaki sapa-basapa gathbandhan ne in donon loksabhaa siton par congress ke khilaaf apane ummidavaar na utaarne kii faisla karke rahul gandhi or sonia gandhi kii siyaasi raah ko aasaan bana diya tha
 However, political equations may change after Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Congress general secretary and in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh, met Bhim Army's founder Chandrasekhar on Wednesday
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne rahul ko amethi main gherne kii kavayad kii thi, jiske chalate congress ko apana kila bachaane main paseene chhot gaye the
 It is believed that the SP-BSP alliance has now changed its strategy to change the mind of not fielding candidates
 agar gathbandhan ne amethi main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or raibareli main sonia gandhi ke khilaaf apane ummidavaar utaarti to congress ko apane garh ko bachaane main lohe ke chane chabane pad sakate hai
 In both Amethi and Raeberli seats, the Dalit and OBC voters, especially from the Yadav community, are quite well
 amethi main muslim matadaata kareeb 4 lakh ke kareeb hai
 While there are close to three lakh Yadavs in Rae Bareli
 jaankaar maanate hai ki sapa-basapa gathbandhan ne agar congress ke khilaaf chunavi maidan main utarane kaa kadam uthaate hai to in votaron main bikharaav hone kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 In such a situation, the path of victory of Congress can be spoiled
 sapa netaa or purv jila panchayat adhyaksh ramsingh yadav ne kaha ki sapa-basapa gathbandhan raibareli or amethi main chunavi maidan main utarate to congress ke liye ye siten jeetna aasaan nahin hoga
 In both the seats, the caste equation is in favor of the alliance, in such a situation, the SP-BSP has given life to the Congress in these seats
 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main sapa raibareli kii chaar siten jeetne main safal rahi thi or congress khaataa nahin khol pai thi
 Whereas, Raisareli District Secretary of Congress Naushad Khatib says that BSP has been contesting elections in Rae Bareli and Amethi every time, but the Congress leadership has never faced any problem
 is kshetra kii janata jatvaad, dharmavad or bhai-bhatijevad se upar uthakar congress netritv ko vot karti he
 In such a situation, even if the SP-BSP contests in these two seats, they are not able to make any significant impact, because the assembly and Lok Sabha elections are different 
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne smriti irani ko rahul gandhi ke khilaaf maidan main utaara tha
 In Amethi parliamentary seat, Rahul Gandhi got nearly four lakh votes and bjp's Smriti Irani got around three lakh votes
 jabaki sapa ne congress ke samarthan main koi ummidavaar nahin utaara tha
 Despite this, Rahul could win by only 1 lakh votes
 iske alaava 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav amethi main congress kaa khaataa nahin khul sakaa tha
 Whereas BJP had won four out of five assembly seats and one seat went to the sp's seat
 vahiin, 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne raibareli se sonia gandhi ke saamne ajay agarwal ko maidan main utaara tha
 Despite the Modi wave, he could not present a tough challenge to Sonia
 lekin bijepi ko kareeb paune do lakh vot mili the
 After this, when the Assembly elections were held in 2017, BJP won 2, Congress 2 and SP won one seat
 amethi or raibareli main bijepi is baar main camel khilaane ke liye kaaphi lambey samay se sakriy he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi also visited Rae Bareli
 is dauraan unhone kai vikaas yojanaon ko hari jhandi dikhaai thi or ek badi raily ko bhi sambodhit kiya tha
 Apart from this, BJP President Amit Shah and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath have worked to connect Congress leaders with them by visiting both the areas
 bijepi ne 2019 main raibareli or amethi kii gheraabandi karne kaa plan bana rakhaa he
 BJP leader Smriti Irani has been active in Amethi for the last five years
 wo lagaataar amethi kaa daura kar rahi hai or sthaneey muddon ko uthaakar congress alaakaman ko gherti rahati hai
 Under this strategy, BJP has merged MLC Dinesh Pratap Singh with Sonia Gandhi's parliamentary seat

 taiwan ke saath bharat ke badhate rishte china ko raas nahin aa rahe hai
 Chinese state media has objected to a team of Taiwanese women mps visiting India
 ye daura donon deshon ke bich disambar 2016 main bane sansadeey mitrataa forum ke tahat rishte sudhaarney kii kavayad kaa hissaa he
 'india playing with fire' magazine Global Times of People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party of China, warned that India is "playing with fire" by hosting this party
 "magazine main chape lekh ke mutabik, "aise vakt main jab america raashtrapati donald trump ne china ko taiwan ke sawaal par chunauti dena band kar diya he, bharat kii ye harakat uksaane vaali he
 "the threat article in the article further commented -" Some Indians consider Taiwan to be a sore corner of China
 bharat lambey vakt se taiwan, dakshin china sagar or dalai lamas ke masalon ko china ke saath molbhav ke liye istemaal karnaa chahta he
 The forces supporting independence in Taiwan have been isolated around the world
 aise main china ko rokane ke liye taiwan kaa istemaal karne vaale deshon ko nuksaan uthaanaa padegaa
 In the article, 'economic cooperation may be threatened', it has been claimed that PM Modi was advised to use Taiwan card in view of the sino-pakistan Economic Corridor undergoing Pakistan's occupation
 bharat 'van china' niti ke evaj main beijing se 'van india' niti kaa bharosa chahta he
 According to the Global Times, Taiwan's investment is critical to India's 'make in India' program
 lekin china bharat ke sabase ahm kaarobaari saajheedaaron main se ek he
 Economic cooperation in both countries will be difficult due to such political quarrels
 purana he china-taiwan kaa jhagadataiwan main sai ing-wain kii aguwai main bani nai sarkaar bharat ke saath kootnithik rishton ko khaas taur par tarjeeh de rahi he
 Like many countries of the world, India does not have a formal diplomatic relationship with Taiwan
 bharat 'van china' niti ko maanata aayaa he
 Political and business relations between the two countries are maintained only through the india-taipei Association
 taiwan ke saansadon kaa ye daura isliye bhi ahm he kyonki bharat sarkaar ke adhikari taiwan ke sarkari daure par nahin jate hai
 China's communist government sees Taiwan as one of its provinces
 haalanki taiwan main logon kii acchhee-khaasi taadaad aazaadee ke haq main he

 dilli ensiaar main lagaataar pradooshan bad rahaa he
 At the same time, Delhi is still running a campaign about pollution, which is called 'emergency of breath'
 kendriya pradooshan niyantran board yani (sipisibi)ne haal hi main ek report jari kii he jisamengaziabad ko pradooshanke maamle main desh bhar main pehla sthaan diya gaya he
 Looking at the location of Ghaziabad, it seems that there is a respiratory emergency
 gajiabad hi sabase bada kaaran he ensiaar main bad rahen pradooshan kaa
 Most of the pollution in Ghaziabad is due to traffic jam
 yahaan se 3 alag-alag neshnal haive nikalate hai, jiske kaaran yahaan rojaanaa hi lambaa trephic jam laga rahata he
 The most settled reason for the increase of pm 10 is that smoke is continuously coming out of these trucks buses
 vahiin duusari or gajiabad ek audyogic kshetra mana jaataa he
 There are thousands of factories here
 inase nikalne vaala dhuaan hawa main jehar kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 Apart from this, pollution is also being spread by the garbage fires
 dilli ensiaar kii hawa main pradooshan failaane kaa bada kaaran anand vihaar bas adda bhi ban rahaa he
 Hundreds of buses are stuck in traffic daily, due to which the smoke from the buses comes out at the same place simultaneously
 yahaan zyaadaatar basen dijal kii hai
 CSE also says that Anand Vihar Bus Base has a big role in increasing pollution
 kendriya pradooshan niyantran board kii report main gajiabad desh main pehle sthaan par
 
 
 The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has prepared a report based on continuous monitoring for the last three years
 is report ke anusaar desh ke 94 shaharon main piem 10 teji se bad rahaa he
 Surprisingly, in these cities, Ghaziabad of Uttar Pradesh is at number one, while the country's capital Delhi is at number four
 sabase khaas baat yah he ki top ten pradooshit shaharon main saat uttar pradesh ke hai
 These are the 10 most polluted cities in terms of PM 10- Ghaziabad- Allahabad- Bareilly- Delhi- Kanpur- Firozabad- Agra- Alwar- Gajraula- Jaipur The biggest reason for increasing PM-10 is the smoke emanating from vehicles
 gajiabadek aisa shahar he jahaan se kai rajyon ke raste nikalate hai
 Three national highways pass through Ghaziabad
 
 
 - neshnal haive- 24- neshnal haive- 58- neshnal haive- 92in haive se hote hue uttarakhand, uttar pradesh, bihar, pashchim bengal, or odisha jaise rajyon main jane kii liye gajiabad se hi hokar guzarana padataa he
 That means clear
 gajiabad main pradooshan badhane kaa sabase sabase bada kaaran yahaan se lagaataar guzarane vaali gaadiyaan hai
 If we talk about Delhi then there are CNG buses in Delhi
 magar gajiabad main zyaadaatar basen dijal se chalane vaali hoti hai
 At the same time, hundreds of buses are coming from different states of the country daily to the Anandvihar bus base near Ghaziabad
 hamane jabgaziabad ke pradooshanko lekar export kii raay janani chaahi to polash mukarji, research associat, CSE kaa kahana tha ki gajiabad main pradooshan kaa sabase bada kaaran yahaan se guzarane vaale vaahan hai
 At the same time, pollution also increases due to smoke coming out of factories
 magar gajiabad mempradooshan badhane kaa karansirf yahaan ke indrestrial aria yaa phir ye vaahan hi nahin hai
 Rather, the dirt that accumulates here also appears to be the main cause of pollution spreading here
 ab jarurat he ki gajiabad main rahane vaale log bhi kam se kampradooshakaren taaki gajiabad pradooshan mukt ho sake

 unako 20 june ko tehran ke aazaadee stadium ke baahar giraftaar kiya gaya tha jahaan vah kuch logon ke saath milakar pradarshan kar rahi thim
 The demonstration was taking place that women should also be allowed to watch the match
 maanavadhikaar sanstha 'emnesti' ke anusaar gavaami ko ivin jail main rakhaa gaya he jo krurta ke liye kukhyat he

 iran haal hi main mahilaon ke prati vyavhaar ke liye kaaphi vivaadon main rahaa he
 Recently, a 26-year-old Iranian woman who murdered a man who tried to rape was hanged
 log hameshaa kehete hai jivan main jo shauk puraa karnaa he use jaldi hi kar lo kyonki life bahut choti he
 But apart from spending on fun, you should also think about protecting the future
 ar iske liye samay rahete financial planning karnaa bahut jaruri he
 The basis of a happy and safe future rests on today's savings, so take this matter a little seriously
 iske liye aap ek bajet banaaen or sevings par dhyaan dete hue 30 kii umr se pehle kuch mahatvapurn arthik faisle jarur le len
 Experts also believe that sensible financial steps taken on time make life easier after crossing the 50 step
 to jaanate hai aise 6 faislon ke bare main jo aapako 30 kii umr paar karne se pehle lene chahie -1) paise jutanakabhi bhi yah nahin sochna chahie ki budhaape kaa budhaape main sochenge
 Keep in mind that the savings you have already made will work in the future
 compound interest kaa ek shabd hameshaa dhyaan rakhen
 If you start depositing money at a young age, then the interest received on this amount under compound interest will also get interest year after year
 agar aap har maheene ek hajaar bhi jutate he to compound interest ke saath aapaki ritairement tak yah raashi khaasi badi ho jaaegi
 2) Before planning the house you should decide before you turn 30 that you have to take your own house or stay in a rented house
 donon hi cese main aapaki selary par boj badhanaa he
 In such a situation, for both rent or EMI on homelone, you should start planning by saving in advance
 3) insurance plan30 saal ke hone se pehle hi jivan beemaa le len
 This comes later in many cases
 beemaa main paisa lagaate samay ek baat hameshaa dhyaan rakhen ki beemaa ek kharch he, nivesh nahin
 In such a situation, avoid falling into the schemes of low returns and take any action only after research
 sirf jivan beemaa karvaa lenaa hi kaaphi nahin he, isiilie jaruri he ki aap medical insurance bhi kara ke rakhen
 Because if you ever have an accident, you have to be hospitalized for several days, which costs a lot of money
 aise main apana or apane parivaar kaa medical insurance jarur karavaaen
 4) Add Emergency Fund: You should always keep your 3-6 months salary as an emergency fund
 iskaa sabase bada phayda yah hoga ki agar aap bich main kahin job chhod dete hai yaa aapako nikaal diya jaataa he tigali job milane tak aap aasaani se bina kisiper ashrith hue apana kharch sambhaal sakate hai
 5) If you have done 2-3 job changes before the career turns 30 and still not satisfied, then the need to do research on yourself
 aise main khud ko thodaa samay den or research kar jaanane kii koshish karen ki aapako kis naukari main khushi milti he
 After this, try to increase your skill by choosing a line
 saath hi jindagi va kharchon main tehraav laane kii koshish karen, taaki aapaki bachat or nivesh, sab nishchit ho saken
 6) Think of children
 If you are married and have children or are planning a family, then start saving for their future too now
 ham sab jaanate hai ki aajkal college kii fees or shaadi kaa kharch, behisaab tareeke se badhate ja rahe hai
 Make sure that you start investing in SIP for your child
 aisa karne se aap uske college kaa samay aane par uske liye aasaani se paise de paaenge or usko apane kadam waapas nahin lene padenge

 Taimur Ali Khan, the younger Nawab of Kareena Kapoor Khan and Saif Ali Khan, is often a part of the news
 haal hi main khabar aa rahi he ki taimur ko karina kaa unhen kis karnaa pasand nahin he
 You must have laughed listening too
 ji haa celebrity kid hone ke naate taimur ke nakhre bhi kam nahin hai
 Recently, during a conversation with Kareena, Kareena told that she loves to kiss Timur with love and how she does it to her son 20,000 times a day, but Timur does not like him to do it at all
 jab wo taimur ko kis karti hai to vah unhen peeche hataane kii koshish karata he
 Saif also forbids him to do so on this action of Kareena, but Kareena cannot stop herself from loving her son
 jab karina ke bete taimur ko dekhakar bole mamaa ranbir, ye koun he?taimur 7 maheene ke ho gaye hai or ab vah kaaphi shararti hone ke saath hi bi toun ke sabase photogenic bachche main se bhi ek hai
 Recently Taimur was seen enjoying the swing in the balcony of his house
 ab jab sabhi use itnaa dekhte hai to bachche ko najar to lag hi jaati he
 Though Kareena may have been very modern and stylish in her pregnancy, but she has as much faith in the old traditions
 tabhi to karina ne ek kinnar ko uski najar utaarne ke 51 hajaar rupee die hai
 Taimur, who returned from Nani Babita's house, got the photo VIRAL to tell you that when Kareena is in her final slot, her film Veere Di Wedding
 tab tak ke liye saf apane shoot ko roak denge yaa samay anusaar shoot karenge
 But will Kareena and Saif plan for the next child after Timur? is par karina ne kaha ki unka aisa koi iraadaa nahin he or temur is bollywood ke star kapal kaa akelaa hi baccha hoga
 When looking at Kareena's son Taimur, Mama Ranbir said, who is this? aam aadmi party (aap) ne baghawat par utar aae apane vidhayak vinod kumaar binni ko ravivaar raat nishkasit kar diya he
 The party has expelled him about 10 days after Binny's verbal attacks against aap's national convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal

 He said that Binny felt bad about being fired, but he had not left any other option
 gauratlab he ki 39 saal ke binni, jo pehle congress main rahe the, ne kejariwal ko taanashaah kaha tha or aarope lagaaya tha ki apane chunavi vaadon se peeche hatakar party dilli kii janata ko dhokhaa de rahi he
 a statement issued by the party said, 'the disciplinary committee has decided to expel Vinod Kumar Binny and end his primary membership in the party
 party evam iske netritv ke khilaaf saream galatabayani karne par unke khilaaf yah karrwai kii gayi he
 His misrepresentation was damaging the party's image
 'is maamle par vichaar karne ke liye party ne 19 janvari ko ek anushaasanic samiti banaayi thi
 The committee headed by Pankaj Gupta included Ashish Talwar, Ilyas Azmi, Yogendra Yadav and Gopal Rai as members
 binni ne elaan kiya tha ki yadi aap 27 janvari tak janata se kiye gaye vaade puure nahin karti to vah jantar-mantar par dharna denge
 Binny termed his expulsion as unfortunate, Aam Aadmi Party expelled Vinod Kumar Binny termed his expulsion as unfortunate and claimed that the ruling party of Delhi wants the government to fall so that it can fulfill the promises it has made to the people
 Could survive party se nishkasana ke kuch hi der baad laksminagar se vidhayak binni ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘isse durbhagyapurna kuch nahin ho saktaa ki aapako koi aisa shaks chahie jo aapako yaad dilaa sake ki aapane janata se kya vaade kiye hai or phir aap usee shaks ko party se nikaal baahar karte hai
 Binny said, "I should have expelled those who talked of dividing the country, who misbehaved with women, who made fun of the country's law and who kept the rules, before i was thrown out of the party

 He had decided to remain unmarried for a lifetime for the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh

 By joining more than two dozen political parties, he formed the NDA, which had more than 80 ministers in its government, also called the Jumbo Cabinet
 is sarkaar ne paanch saal kaa kaarykaal puraa kiya
 Opposition was also convinced of ideas; Atal Bihari Vajpayee was never a foster of aggression in politics
 vaicharikta ko unhone hameshaa tavajjo diya
 Atal ji believes that politics was not his first subject of mind
 raajnneeti se unhen kabhi-kabhi trishna hoti thi
 However, they could not flee even if they wanted to because the opposition would stamp them out
 ve apane rajnatik dayitvon kaa dat kar muqabla karnaa chaahate the
 It was also the quality of his life's struggle
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ek kavi ke rup main apni pahchaan bananaa chaahate the
 But, it started with journalism

 Atal has always been a foster of equality in society

 He has not been opposed to economic liberalization and foreign aid but he is not supportive of promoting such a policy, which is against the national interest

 On 24 February 1988 in Mumbai, Sachin Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli teamed up with 664 runs during the Harris Shield tournament, which attracted the attention of the whole world, as it was a new record for any kind of cricket at that time
 
 
 tippaniyan The Mumbai School Sports Association was responsible for keeping these records, but now it says that they cannot keep the 25 year old papers
 
 
 darasal, asaliyat yah he ki kuch saal pehle hi us match ke scorcard ko safed chitiyaan kha chuki hai
 
 
 Although the record of Sachin Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli was broken by Mohammad Shaibaz and Manoj Kumar of Hyderabad in 2006, a partnership of 721 runs, but this record related to the highly respected cricketer Sachin, when NDTV cricket secretary of Mumbai School Sports Association Asked about this in the morning, he gave a terse answer and said that before that there was another committee, and anyway 25 Can not be maintained in the old documents

 Art dealer Kenny Shakter, who settled in London on Monday, highlighted the answer to this question in an article written for the website artnews

 Since the record auction at Christie's in 2017, the painting depicts Jesus Christ coming out of the darkness and blessing the world with one hand, while his other hand holds a transparent globe

 ’’ Two pictures appeared on TV on Tuesday
 inamen puche jate sawaal ek baar phir kashmir ko charchaa ke centre main laate hai
 
 
 The first picture was of a sociologist Parth Chatterjee surrounded by journalists
 jinhen gher kar sahaafee ye puch rahe the ki wo apane tazaa lekh main prakat kiye gayi vichaaron kaa bachaav kaise karenge jisamen unhone senadhyaksh vipin ravat or angrez general diar ke bayanon kii tulana kii he? The second picture is of CPM leader Prakash Karat surrounded by journalists in which he is being questioned on an editorial written in the party mouthpiece People's Democracy in which General Vipin Rawat is criticized for politicizing the army and in his recent interview, Modi government's thinking Has been reported
 jane maane samaajavigyaani parth chatarji ne angrezi website ‘di vir’ main 2 june ko ek lekh likhaa jisamen unhone ghati main kashmiri noujvaan farrukh ahamed daar ko jeep se baandhne or ghumaane kii sena kii karrwai (or uske baad is karrwai ko anjaam dene vaale ko major litul gogoi ko mili sammaan or army chif general vipin ravat ke intervyuu ) ko general diar mument kaha yani unhone us ghatana kii tulana jaliyanvaala baag hatyakand se kii
 Partha makes this comparison not only on the basis of Major Gogoi's action but also on the statements that were part of General Vipin Rawat's interview
 parth chatarji apane lekh main kehete hai, “ye kahana sahi nahin hoga ki general ravat ke iraade vahi the jo general diar ke the”
 But Chatterjee shows a similarity to the statements that Dyer made in defense of his action after Jallianwala Bagh, and General Rawat in his interview defending Major Gogoi after the Kashmir incident
 lekh kii shuruyaat main hi parth general diar ko uddhrut karte hai or kehete hai – “aisa vakt aata he jab aap aaina dekhte hai or usamen ek aisa cheharaa dekhakar stabdh rah jate hai jise aap nahin pahachaanate – ek vikrut ajanabi kaa badsoorat cheharaa
 It would be very difficult for many Indians to believe that as a state we have reached the moment of General Dyer, but think carefully and objectively, the arguments in favor of the british-indian Army action in 1919 and today 100 Years later, there are scary similarities in what the defense of the Indian Army said
 ” Partha writes that General Dyer was not defended by the British leaders, but Major Gogoi is defended by the Chief of Army Staff as well as the Minister of Government
 kendriya mantri vankeya naidu ne parth chatarji ke lekh kii kadi aalochana karte huye iske khilaaf parvarjan or idiotic jaise shabdon kaa istemaal kiya
 Surrounded by journalists, Partha Chatterjee said he would write a response to any criticism, not speaking in front of the cameras
 parth chatarji kaa lekh general ravat ke intervyuu se lekar sena ke raajnneetikaran tak ke sawaal uthaata he
 After honoring Major Leetul Gogoi, General Rawat even said in his interview that people should be afraid of the army
 bharat jaise loktantric desh main senadhyaksh kaa ye bayaan daraane vaala he
 General Rawat said - "in such a battle you find new ways
 aap ek gande yuddh ko naye tareekon ko khoj kar ladate hai
 If my officers ask what we should do, should i tell them to wait and die? i will bring you a nice coffin and tricolor and will carry your body with respect to your family members
 ” General Rawat's statement may justify Major letul Gogoi's act in view of the army's compulsions and difficult circumstances, but it is also an attempt to blur and ignore many questions
 farrukh ahamed daar kii tasviir ab kashmir main chal rahe virodh kaa ek amit hissaa ban chuki he or ye tasviir ek anushaasit or maanviya hone kaa daawa karne vaali bhartiya sena kaa peechha karti rahegi
 Perhaps no one knows this better than Major Gogoi and General Rawat
 shaayad isiliye apane lekh main parth chatarji daar ke maanav dhaal banaaye jane kii isi tasviir kii tulana vietnam war kii us bahucharchit tasviir se karte hai
 Where an 8-year-old girl is running on the road with bruises
 aap sharmasaar karne vaali or yuddh kaa vikrut cheharaa dikhaane vaali ye tasviir google main aasaani se dhund sakate hai
 The questions raised by Chatterjee in his article start the debate on how to judge military decisions on morality
 yahaan angrez darshanik jerimi bantham kaa utiliterinism kaa siddhant major gogoi kaa bachaav kar saktaa he
 Bentham says that a judgment should be evaluated on the morality criterion based on the outcome of that decision
 bantham kaa tark he ki ham adhiktam logon ke liye adhiktam khushi dhundhen
 According to his reasoning, Major Gogoi's argument of saving many people along with army personnel can work
 mujhe nahin pataa ki major litul gogoi jerimi bantham or unki theory ko jaanate hai yaa farrukh daar ko jeep main baandhte vakt unhone bantham ke bare main sochaa hoga lekin jo tark unhone diya vah utiliterinism kaa siddhant hi he jise angrezi main consequencial moral rizaning kaha jaataa he yani aap apane krity ke parinaam ke aadhaar par naitikta tay karte hai
 The great philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, was also criticized for his theory, because this thinking ignores the rights of minorities (here the word means number is not from any religion) in a moral judgment, ie the death of a person
 If 100 people survive, Bentham's theory advocates that act
 duusari ore parth chatarji jis ore ishaara kar rahe hai vah german darshanik imenual kaant kaa siddhant he ki aakhri nattejey jo bhi hon aap kya kadam uthaate hai vahi aapaki naitikta kaa paimaana he
 On this basis, criticism of Major Gogoi and General Rawat is justified

 Partha Chatterjee in his article says that Dyer forced Indians to crawl into the street of Amritsar in which a British woman was beaten
 diar ne apane bachaav main kaha ki aisa karnaa unka “daraavna” or “ganda farz” tha
 Partha Chatterjee puts these words of Dyer in front of an interview by General Vipin Rawat in which he has called the battle of Kashmir a "dirty war"

 Opposing the army is in the interest of the basic rights of the citizens of any country, then it should be opposed

 The same thing is said with caution by former bureaucrat and author Pawan Verma
 verma ne kaha, “kisi bhi adhikari yaa sanstha par sawaal uthaaya ja saktaa he kyonki yahaan loktantr he
 Raising the question is not treason, but i will also say here in the same rhythm that Parth Chatterjee could have avoided the language he used
 ”tippaniyan What Verma is referring to is the metaphors used in Partha Chatterjee's article

 The question is whether Partha Chatterjee could not have said the same without using the extras of comparison with General Dyer
 general diar or general vipin ravat kii saajha photo or lekh kaa sheershak shaayad parth ke puure tark ko dhundhala karata dikhataa he
 The author's attempt to shackle the society and those in power and awaken his conscience seems to stray in this exaggeration and the important question he loses at the end of his article is that as a nation, we are making such delicate turn But that can take us towards martial law i

 At the beginning of the article, Partha quotes General Dyer and says - "there comes a time when you look at a mirror and are stunned to see a face you don't recognize - the ugly face of a perverted stranger

 After honoring Major Leetul Gogoi, General Rawat even said in his interview that people should be afraid of the army

 General Rawat said - "in such a battle you find new ways
 aap ek gande yuddh ko naye tareekon ko khoj kar ladate hai
 If my officers ask what we should do, should i tell them to wait and die? i will bring you a nice coffin and tricolor and will carry your body with respect to your family members
 ” General Rawat's statement may justify Major letul Gogoi's act in view of the army's compulsions and difficult circumstances, but it is also an attempt to blur and ignore many questions
 farrukh ahamed daar kii tasviir ab kashmir main chal rahe virodh kaa ek amit hissaa ban chuki he or ye tasviir ek anushaasit or maanviya hone kaa daawa karne vaali bhartiya sena kaa peechha karti rahegi
 Perhaps no one knows this better than Major Gogoi and General Rawat

 Where an 8-year-old girl is running on the road with bruises
 aap sharmasaar karne vaali or yuddh kaa vikrut cheharaa dikhaane vaali ye tasviir google main aasaani se dhund sakate hai
 The questions raised by Chatterjee in his article start the debate on how to judge military decisions on morality
 yahaan angrez darshanik jerimi bantham kaa utiliterinism kaa siddhant major gogoi kaa bachaav kar saktaa he
 Bentham says that a judgment should be evaluated on the morality criterion based on the outcome of that decision
 bantham kaa tark he ki ham adhiktam logon ke liye adhiktam khushi dhundhen
 According to his reasoning, Major Gogoi's argument of saving many people along with army personnel can work
 mujhe nahin pataa ki major litul gogoi jerimi bantham or unki theory ko jaanate hai yaa farrukh daar ko jeep main baandhte vakt unhone bantham ke bare main sochaa hoga lekin jo tark unhone diya vah utiliterinism kaa siddhant hi he jise angrezi main consequencial moral rizaning kaha jaataa he yani aap apane krity ke parinaam ke aadhaar par naitikta tay karte hai
 The great philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, was also criticized for his theory, because this thinking ignores the rights of minorities (here the word means number is not from any religion) in a moral judgment, ie the death of a person
 If 100 people survive, Bentham's theory advocates that act
 duusari ore parth chatarji jis ore ishaara kar rahe hai vah german darshanik imenual kaant kaa siddhant he ki aakhri nattejey jo bhi hon aap kya kadam uthaate hai vahi aapaki naitikta kaa paimaana he
 On this basis, criticism of Major Gogoi and General Rawat is justified
 kaant ne apane siddhant main “moral worth” shabd kaa istemaal kiya yani vah puunji jo is baat kii parvaah nahin karti ki aakhir main aap buraai ko roak paayenge yaa acha parinaam hasil kar paayenge yaa nahin
 Kant says that the decision should be based on morality
 gandhi ji kii soch bi is bare main spashth rahi he ki saadhan or saadhy donon pavitra hone chahie
 Partha Chatterjee in his article says that Dyer forced Indians to crawl into the street of Amritsar in which a British woman was beaten
 diar ne apane bachaav main kaha ki aisa karnaa unka “daraavna” or “ganda farz” tha
 Partha Chatterjee puts these words of Dyer in front of an interview by General Vipin Rawat in which he has called the battle of Kashmir a "dirty war"
 lekin mangalvaar ko jo tasviren saamne ai unamem sena ke raajnneetikaran kaa ek sawaal uthaane par patrkaar sipiem netaa prakaash karaat ke peeche ye kah kar daud rahe the ki aap sena ke paksh main khadey hone se kyon hichak rahe hai
 Opposing the army is in the interest of the basic rights of the citizens of any country, then it should be opposed
 isamen deshadroh jaisi kya baat he
 The same thing is said with caution by former bureaucrat and author Pawan Verma
 verma ne kaha, “kisi bhi adhikari yaa sanstha par sawaal uthaaya ja saktaa he kyonki yahaan loktantr he
 Raising the question is not treason, but i will also say here in the same rhythm that Parth Chatterjee could have avoided the language he used
 ”tippaniyan What Verma is referring to is the metaphors used in Partha Chatterjee's article
 chatarji bhaawanaaon main bahakar na keval ek ativaadee tulana karte hai balki vah netaaon kii raajnneetik vifaltaa or kashmir main seemapar se chal rahe aatankwaad ko bilkul nazarandaaz kar dete hai
 The question is whether Partha Chatterjee could not have said the same without using the extras of comparison with General Dyer
 general diar or general vipin ravat kii saajha photo or lekh kaa sheershak shaayad parth ke puure tark ko dhundhala karata dikhataa he
 The author's attempt to shackle the society and those in power and awaken his conscience seems to stray in this exaggeration and the important question he loses at the end of his article is that as a nation, we are making such delicate turn But that can take us towards martial law i
e
 military rule like Pakistan
 parth chatarji kaa lekh general ravat ke intervyuu se lekar sena ke raajnneetikaran tak ke sawaal uthaata he
 After honoring Major Leetul Gogoi, General Rawat even said in his interview that people should be afraid of the army

 General Rawat said - "in such a battle you find new ways
 aap ek gande yuddh ko naye tareekon ko khoj kar ladate hai
 If my officers ask what we should do, should i tell them to wait and die? i will bring you a nice coffin and tricolor and will carry your body with respect to your family members
 ” General Rawat's statement may justify Major letul Gogoi's act in view of the army's compulsions and difficult circumstances, but it is also an attempt to blur and ignore many questions
 farrukh ahamed daar kii tasviir ab kashmir main chal rahe virodh kaa ek amit hissaa ban chuki he or ye tasviir ek anushaasit or maanviya hone kaa daawa karne vaali bhartiya sena kaa peechha karti rahegi
 Perhaps no one knows this better than Major Gogoi and General Rawat
 shaayad isiliye apane lekh main parth chatarji daar ke maanav dhaal banaaye jane kii isi tasviir kii tulana vietnam war kii us bahucharchit tasviir se karte hai
 Where an 8-year-old girl is running on the road with bruises
 aap sharmasaar karne vaali or yuddh kaa vikrut cheharaa dikhaane vaali ye tasviir google main aasaani se dhund sakate hai
 The questions raised by Chatterjee in his article start the debate on how to judge military decisions on morality
 yahaan angrez darshanik jerimi bantham kaa utiliterinism kaa siddhant major gogoi kaa bachaav kar saktaa he
 Bentham says that a judgment should be evaluated on the morality criterion based on the outcome of that decision
 bantham kaa tark he ki ham adhiktam logon ke liye adhiktam khushi dhundhen
 According to his reasoning, Major Gogoi's argument of saving many people along with army personnel can work
 mujhe nahin pataa ki major litul gogoi jerimi bantham or unki theory ko jaanate hai yaa farrukh daar ko jeep main baandhte vakt unhone bantham ke bare main sochaa hoga lekin jo tark unhone diya vah utiliterinism kaa siddhant hi he jise angrezi main consequencial moral rizaning kaha jaataa he yani aap apane krity ke parinaam ke aadhaar par naitikta tay karte hai
 The great philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, was also criticized for his theory, because this thinking ignores the rights of minorities (here the word means number is not from any religion) in a moral judgment, ie the death of a person
 If 100 people survive, Bentham's theory advocates that act
 duusari ore parth chatarji jis ore ishaara kar rahe hai vah german darshanik imenual kaant kaa siddhant he ki aakhri nattejey jo bhi hon aap kya kadam uthaate hai vahi aapaki naitikta kaa paimaana he
 On this basis, criticism of Major Gogoi and General Rawat is justified
 kaant ne apane siddhant main “moral worth” shabd kaa istemaal kiya yani vah puunji jo is baat kii parvaah nahin karti ki aakhir main aap buraai ko roak paayenge yaa acha parinaam hasil kar paayenge yaa nahin
 Kant says that the decision should be based on morality
 gandhi ji kii soch bi is bare main spashth rahi he ki saadhan or saadhy donon pavitra hone chahie
 Partha Chatterjee in his article says that Dyer forced Indians to crawl into the street of Amritsar in which a British woman was beaten
 diar ne apane bachaav main kaha ki aisa karnaa unka “daraavna” or “ganda farz” tha
 Partha Chatterjee puts these words of Dyer in front of an interview by General Vipin Rawat in which he has called the battle of Kashmir a "dirty war"
 lekin mangalvaar ko jo tasviren saamne ai unamem sena ke raajnneetikaran kaa ek sawaal uthaane par patrkaar sipiem netaa prakaash karaat ke peeche ye kah kar daud rahe the ki aap sena ke paksh main khadey hone se kyon hichak rahe hai
 Opposing the army is in the interest of the basic rights of the citizens of any country, then it should be opposed
 isamen deshadroh jaisi kya baat he
 The same thing is said with caution by former bureaucrat and author Pawan Verma
 verma ne kaha, “kisi bhi adhikari yaa sanstha par sawaal uthaaya ja saktaa he kyonki yahaan loktantr he
 Raising the question is not treason, but i will also say here in the same rhythm that Parth Chatterjee could have avoided the language he used
 ”tippaniyan What Verma is referring to is the metaphors used in Partha Chatterjee's article
 chatarji bhaawanaaon main bahakar na keval ek ativaadee tulana karte hai balki vah netaaon kii raajnneetik vifaltaa or kashmir main seemapar se chal rahe aatankwaad ko bilkul nazarandaaz kar dete hai
 The question is whether Partha Chatterjee could not have said the same without using the extras of comparison with General Dyer
 general diar or general vipin ravat kii saajha photo or lekh kaa sheershak shaayad parth ke puure tark ko dhundhala karata dikhataa he
 The author's attempt to shackle the society and those in power and awaken his conscience seems to stray in this exaggeration and the important question he loses at the end of his article is that as a nation, we are making such delicate turn But that can take us towards martial law i
e
 military rule like Pakistan
 general ravat ne kaha – “aisi hi jang main aap naye tareeke dhundte hai
 You fight a dirty war by finding new ways
 agar mere afasar poochhate hai ki ham kya karen to kya mujhe unase kahana chaiye ki intazaar karo or mar jaao? main tumhaare liye ek badhiya coffin or tirangaa lekar aauungaa or tumhaare shav ko sammaan ke saath tumhaare parivaar waalon tak pahunchaa duungaa
 " general ravat kaa ye bayaan bhale hi sena kii majaburi or kathin halaat ke maddenzar major litul gogoi ke krity ko sahi tehraata ho lekin vah kai sawaalon ko dhundhala karne or unki andekhi karne kii koshish bhi he
 The picture of Farooq Ahmed Dar has now become an indelible part of the ongoing protest in Kashmir and this picture will continue to chase the Indian Army, claiming to be a disciplined and humane
 ye baat shaayad major gogoi or general ravat se behatar koi or nahin jaanata
 Perhaps that's why Parth Chatterjee in his article compares the same picture of Dar's human shield being made to that much-talked about Vietnam War
 jahaan ek 8 saal kii ladki bam se mili zakhmon ke saath sadak par daud rahi he
 You can easily find this picture in shame and showing the warped face of war
 chatarji ne apane lekh se jo sawaal uthaaye hai wo sena ke faislon ko naitikta kii kasuti par kasne kii bahes phir shuru karte hai
 Here the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham's theory of utilitarianism can defend Major Gogoi
 bantham kehete hai ki kisi faisle kaa naitikta kii kasuti par moolyankan us faisle ke parinaamon ke aadhaar par hona chaiye
 Bentham argues that we should seek maximum happiness for maximum people
 unke tark ke hisaab se sena ke javaanon ke saath kai logon ko bachaane kii major gogoi ne jo daleel di vah kaam kar sakati he
 i do not know if Major Leetul Gogoi knows Jeremy Bentham and his theory, or he may have thought of Bentham while tying Farrukh Dar in a jeep, but the argument he made is the principle of Utilitarianism, which is called Conventional Moral Reasoning in English That is, you decide morality based on the outcome of your act
 mahaan darshanik kahe jane vaale jerimi bantham kii apni is theory ke liye badi aalochana bhi hui kyonki yah soch kisi naitik faisle main alpsankhyakon (yahaan shabd kaa matlab number se he kisi dharm se nahin ) ke adhikaron ko andekha karti he yani ek vyakti ke marane se agar 100 log bachate hai to bantham kaa siddhant us krity kii vakaalat karata he
 On the other hand, what Partha Chatterjee is pointing out is the theory of German philosopher Emmanuel Kant that whatever action you take, whatever the final outcome is, is the measure of your morality
 is aadhaar par major gogoi or general ravat kii aalochana jaays he
 Kant used the term "moral worth" in his theory, capital that does not care whether you will be able to stop evil or achieve good results
 kaant kehete hai ki faisla naitikta ke aadhaar par hi hona chaiye
 Gandhiji has been clear about the idea that both means and means should be sacred
 apane lekh main parth chatarji kehete hai ki diar ne bharatiyon ko amritsar kii us gali main rengkar chalane par majaboor kiya jisamen ek british mahila kii pitayee hui thi
 Dyer said in his defense that doing so was his "horror" and "dirty duty"
 parth chatarji diar ke in shabdon ko general vipin ravat ke us intervyuu ke saamne rakhte hai jisamen unhone kashmir kii ladaai ko ek “darty war” kaha he
 But in the pictures which came out on Tuesday, the journalist was running behind CPM leader Prakash Karat on the question of politicizing the army, why are you hesitating to stand in favor of the army
 sena kaa virodh karnaa kisi desh desh ke nagarikon ke mul adhikaron ke hit main he to vah virodh kiya janaa chaiye
 What is there like treason in this? isi baat ko saavdhaanee ke saath kehete hai purv beurocret or lekhak pawan verma
 Varma said, "any officer or institution can be questioned because there is democracy here
" sawaal uthaanaa deshadroh nahin he lekin main yahaan par isi lay main ye bhi kahuunga ki parth chatarji ne jis bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya he usase vah batch sakate the
 "comments verma jis ore ishaara kar rahe hai vah parth chatarji ke lekh main istemaal kiye gayi rupakon kaa he
 Chatterjee not only makes an extreme comparison by drowning in sentiment, but he completely ignores the political failure of the leaders and the cross-border terrorism in Kashmir
 sawaal ye he ki kya parth chatarji general diar se tulana ke atirupakon kaa istemaal kiye bagaiyr yahi baat nahin kah sakate the
 Shared photos of General Dyer and General Vipin Rawat and the title of the article probably seem to blur Parth's entire argument
 samaaj or satta main baithe logon ko jhakzorne or unke zamir ko jagaane kii lekhak kii koshish is atishyokti main kahin bhatakati dikhti he or vah ahm sawaal kahin kho jaataa he jo vah apane lekh ke aakhir main uthaate hai ki raashtra ke taur par ham aise najuk mode par hai jo hamen pakistan kii tarah marshall lau yani sena kii hukumat kii ore le ja saktaa he

 Kant used the term "moral worth" in his theory, capital that does not care whether you will be able to stop evil or achieve good results
 kaant kehete hai ki faisla naitikta ke aadhaar par hi hona chaiye
 Gandhiji has been clear about the idea that both means and means should be sacred
 apane lekh main parth chatarji kehete hai ki diar ne bharatiyon ko amritsar kii us gali main rengkar chalane par majaboor kiya jisamen ek british mahila kii pitayee hui thi
 Dyer said in his defense that doing so was his "horror" and "dirty duty"
 parth chatarji diar ke in shabdon ko general vipin ravat ke us intervyuu ke saamne rakhte hai jisamen unhone kashmir kii ladaai ko ek “darty war” kaha he
 But in the pictures which came out on Tuesday, the journalist was running behind CPM leader Prakash Karat on the question of politicizing the army, why are you hesitating to stand in favor of the army

 Chatterjee not only makes an extreme comparison by drowning in sentiment, but he completely ignores the political failure of the leaders and the cross-border terrorism in Kashmir
 sawaal ye he ki kya parth chatarji general diar se tulana ke atirupakon kaa istemaal kiye bagaiyr yahi baat nahin kah sakate the
 Shared photos of General Dyer and General Vipin Rawat and the title of the article probably seem to blur Parth's entire argument

 Partha Chatterjee, in his article, says that Dyer forced Indians to crawl into a street in Amritsar where a British woman was beaten
 diar ne apane bachaav main kaha ki aisa karnaa unka “daraavna” or “ganda farz” tha
 Partha Chatterjee puts these words of Dyer in front of an interview by General Vipin Rawat in which he has called the battle of Kashmir a "dirty war"
 lekin mangalvaar ko jo tasviren saamne ai unamem sena ke raajnneetikaran kaa ek sawaal uthaane par patrkaar sipiem netaa prakaash karaat ke peeche ye kah kar daud rahe the ki aap sena ke paksh main khadey hone se kyon hichak rahe hai
 Opposing the army is in the interest of the basic rights of the citizens of any country, then it should be opposed
 isamen deshadroh jaisi kya baat he
 The same thing is said with caution by former bureaucrat and author Pawan Verma
 verma ne kaha, “kisi bhi adhikari yaa sanstha par sawaal uthaaya ja saktaa he kyonki yahaan loktantr he
 Raising the question is not treason, but i will also say here in the same rhythm that Parth Chatterjee could have avoided the language he used
 ”tippaniyan What Verma is referring to is the metaphors used in Partha Chatterjee's article
 chatarji bhaawanaaon main bahakar na keval ek ativaadee tulana karte hai balki vah netaaon kii raajnneetik vifaltaa or kashmir main seemapar se chal rahe aatankwaad ko bilkul nazarandaaz kar dete hai
 The question is whether Partha Chatterjee could not have said the same without using the extras of comparison with General Dyer
 general diar or general vipin ravat kii saajha photo or lekh kaa sheershak shaayad parth ke puure tark ko dhundhala karata dikhataa he
 The author's attempt to shackle the society and those in power and awaken his conscience seems to stray in this exaggeration and the important question he loses at the end of his article is that as a nation, we are making such delicate turn But that can take us towards martial law i

 maharashtra vidhaan bhawan main mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis or kisaanon ke bich vaarta sampann ho gai he
 The Maharashtra government has accepted all the demands of the farmers
 sarkaar ne likhit main bina shart maangen maan lee hai
 After the talks, the delegation of farmers reached Azad Maidan with the farmers and told what issues were discussed with the Chief Minister
 pratinidhimandal ne yah bhi bataaya ki sarkaar kii ore se kisaanon ko kya aashwaasan mila he
 Earlier, a delegation of farmers from different districts of Maharashtra reached Azad Maidan in Mumbai gathered outside the Vidhan Bhavan to meet the state CM Devendra Fadnavis
 inke saath maharashtra sarkaar ke mantri girish mahajan bhi maujuud hai
 The farmers demand that the government give them assurance in writing, only then they will return
 udhar, girish mahajan ne kaha he ki adivasee jameen ko lekar kisaanon ke bich kuch galatfahami he, jise jald hi dur kar liya jayega
 He has said that now there is no need for farmers to sit on dharna
 bataa den ki maharashtra ke kisaan ek baar phir se apni maangon ko lekar 2 divasiy pradarshan ke tahat guuruuvaar sabuh 11 baje ke kareeb mumbai ke aaazaad maidan pahunch gaye the
 Thousands of farmers, under the banner of the Peasants and Adivasi Lok Sangharsh Samiti, demonstrated for their demands at 4:30 am from the Somaiya Maidan of Chunabhatti to Azad Maidan in Mumbai
 lok sangharsh morcha kii aguwai main kisaan pehle dadar pahunche or phir aaazaad maidan pahunche
 The farmers started a protest in Thane on Wednesday to voice their demands
 abu azmi pahunche aaazaad maidanisase pehle, samaajawaaji party ke netaa abu azmi or vipaksh ke netaa aar vikhe patil bhi aaazaad maidan pahunche
 Minister Girish Mahajan also reached there
 duusari ore, rajya ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne kisaanon ke pratinidhimandal ko baatcheet ke liye bulaayaa tha, lekin dopaher do baje tak inke bich main baatcheet nahin ho saki thi
 Earlier, in March this year, such a big demonstration took place when 25 thousand came to Mumbai from Kisannasik
 baari suraksha vyavasthamorcha main purush or mahilaon ke alaava bachche or bujurg bhi shaamil hai
 Protesters are marching towards Azad Maidan shouting slogans against the government
 suraksha ke maddenjar baari police bal ko morche ke saath tainaat kiya gaya he
 Police officers themselves are also present
 ummid he ki ye morcha subah 10 baje tak aaazaad maidan pahunch jayega
 Farmer leader and Lok Sangharsh Morcha Director Pratibha Shinde told Aaj Tak that if the government does not meet our demands, we will stage a sit-in demonstration and if needed, will also conduct a jail bharo movement
 yah kisaan maharashtra ke alag-alag jilon se aae hai
 Among them are the tribal farmers who are requesting the government that the forest land where these farmers have been cultivating for the last several years should be done in their names
 6 maheene pehle bhi kiya tha pradarshanmukhya rup se lod sheding kii samasya, vanadhikaar kanoon lagu karne, sookhe se raahat, nunetan samarthan mulya, swaminathan report lagu karne jaisi maangon ke saath yekisanphir se sadak par utre hai
 The farmers complain that the last demonstration has been around 6 months, out of which many assurances given to the farmers have not been fulfilled so far
 kareeb 6 maheene pehle bhi apni maangon ko lekar kisaanon ne morcha nikaala tha jiske liye sarkaar ne 6 maheene kaa vakt maang tha
 At present, the winter session of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly is going on and it will be interesting to see what the Maharashtra Government does for these farmers or send them back to their homes once again
 aaj dinabhar ye andolankaaree kisaan mumbai ke aaazaad maidan main baith kar andolan karenge
 Farmers in Maharashtra are agitated again and their movement includes many social workers and people associated with the peasant movements
 sanghathan kii ore se kaha gaya he ki agar maharashtra sarkaar kii ore se koi thos aashwaasan nahin diya jaataa he to andolan ko or aage badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 a large part of Maharashtra suffers from drought every year and farmers' suicides are a serious challenge for the state government
 march main kisaanon ke vyapak pradarshan ke dauraan maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne kaha tha ki sarkaar unke muddon ko sulajhaayegi
 The government is positive about their demands
 tab kaha tha ki unki maangon par charchaa ke liye hamane mantriyon kii ek samiti banaai he
 However, the Chief Minister later claimed in an Aaj Tak program that one of the people who had come to Mumbai from Nashik was not Kisanasan, rather he was a tribal and was seeking land from the state government to do farming
