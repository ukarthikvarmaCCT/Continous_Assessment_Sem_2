 Before Udit Raj's case came up for discussion, the BJP announced its nominee Sunny Deol from Gurdaspur in Punjab as its candidate
 deol kuch ghante pehle hi bhaajapa main shaamil hue the
 By late evening, the ticket of another BJP Dalit face, Union Minister of State Vijay Sampla, was also cut from Hoshiarpur
 ek hi din hue in teenon ghatnaon ne party ke andar or baahar (virdohi dalon) is charchaa ko hawa de di ki bhaajapa ko ab party kader nahin, dalbadalu or celibrity priy hai
 More than this, the discussion has also become heated that finally the anti-dalit face of the BJP is being exposed
 congress mahasachiv ke
 C
 venugopal kehete hai, ''ab yah mudda saaf ho gaya he ki centre sarkaar or bhaajapa dalit virdohi he
 The BJP may want the votes of the Dalits but they do not like strong Dalit leaders
 aise netaaon ko bhaajapa siyaasi rup se khatm karnaa chaahati he
 "A senior BJP denied ticket leader says," The claim of being a cadre-based party leads us only to show off
 kaadaron ko pratyaashee banane kaa jab samay aata he to pataa chalata he ki koi celebrati tikat le gaya
 "there are dozens of names like Shahnawaz Hussain, Kirit Somaiya, Krishna Raj, Ashok Dhode, Udit Raj, Vijay Sampla who were marginalized by the party
 unka sawaal he, ''gautam gambhir, sanni deol, ravi kishan, nirahua, hansraj hans, kiran kher jaise logon ko tikat mil jaataa he
 Are they BJP cadres? "although BJP national spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP GVL Narasimha Rao claims," the party has fielded 438 candidates this time
 inamen zyaadaatar ummidavaar vahi hai jo party se varshon se jude hue hai
 It is true that some such people have also got tickets, but the party does expand itself
 ham samaaj ke vibhinn kshetron ke logon ko party main shaamil karte hai, yah koi galat baat nahin he
 "even after these claims of GVL, the truth is that more than a dozen such people have been nominated to BJP, who are either defective or celebrity
 maharashtra main congress se aae sujay vikhe, bijd se aae jai pandas, bijd se hi bhaajapa main shaamil hue balbhadra maanjhi, trinmul congress se bhaajapa main shaamil hue anupam haajra, saumitr khan, arjuna singh, makapa se aae khagen murmu, congress se aae e
 Manju, Umesh Jadhav, Devendrappa, d
 ke
 People like Aruna have been nominated by the BJP
 ye sabhi netaa aise hai jo mahaj kuch maheene pehle hi bhaajapa main shaamil hue the
 To give them tickets, the party sidelined the activists who have been active for years
 isliye uthe savalakaryakartaaon kii upeksha kaa mudda party main isliye uthne laga he kyonki bhaajapa ne yah spasht kar diya he ki 2019 ke chunaav main cheharaa sirf modi kaa he
 Focusing on candidates is strictly prohibited
 bhaajapa ke rajyasabha saansad rajeev chandrashekhar kehete hai, ''is chunaav kaa mudda pradhanmantri narendra modi hai
 Whoever the candidate is, people are giving votes in the name of Modi
 aise main modi ke alaava kisi duusare chehre kii jarurat nahin he
 "udit Raj (now Congress leader) says," If this is the case then there is no need to make Gautam Gambhir, Ravi Kishan, Nirhua, Sunny Deol candidates
 unki jagah kisi kader ko, party ke kisi jila yaa mandal adhyaksh ko hi pratyaashee banaaya ja saktaa tha
 The right thing is that the current leadership of the BJP does not want to let any strong leader or Dalit leader associated with the land flourish
 "haalanki bhaajapa se jude ek dalit netaa kaa kahana he, ''party ne 2014 main puri shiddat se daliton main paith banaai
 From eating food with him, he was given importance in the electoral stage and organization
 " vaise, uttar pradesh vidhansabha ke chunaav tak party aise kaarykram jarur chalaati rahi
 But it is also true that when the Dalit resentment across the country sparked against Dalit atrocities, gradually the party started shying away from the Dalits
 madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan ke chunaav main bhaajapa ko jab haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa or uttar pradesh main basapa-sapa ek saath aae to bhaajapa ko shaayad yah lagane laga ki dalit voter bhaajapa ke saath aane vaala nahin he
 Only after that did the Dalit mps in the party ignore
 2014 main anasuchit jati ke liye arakshit 84 siton main se bhaajapa 40 or anusuchit janajatiyon ke liye arakshit 41 siton main se 27 siten jeet gai thi
 This time out of these 67 mps, BJP cut the tickets of 34 mps
 kya he ranneetibhajapa ke ranneetikaron kaa maananaa he ki lambey samay ke baad party is mukaam par pahunchi he ki isamen kisi bhi jati yaa varg kaa koi sarvamaanya bada netaa nahin he
 At one time, Brahmin leaders like Kalyan Singh Lodh leader, Gopinath Munde backward leader, Kalraj Mishra and Tarakant Jha were in the party
 in netaaon kii naaraazgi kaa matlab he ki ve jis jati se jude netaa hai, vah jati bhaajapa se naaraaz ho sakati thi
 But the modi-shah duo broke the monastery inside the party
 aise main udit raaj yaa saanpala jaise netaa khud ko yadi party ke dalit chehre ke rup main sthapit karne kii mahatvakanksha paale baithe the to us par ankush lagaana party ke liye lajimi ho gaya tha
 It has been said that instead of cutting the tickets of 37 Scheduled Caste and Tribe mps, the candidates who have been appointed in their place are also from the same castes
 party ranneetikaron kaa daawa he ki jinke tikat kate hai unke khilaaf satta virdohi rujhaan unke sansadeey ilaake main tha
 a practical motive behind awarding tickets to the celebrity is to give tickets to the winning candidate
 jin siton par bhaajapa adhik majboot nahin he vahaan duusare dalon se aae netaaon ko tikat diya gaya he
 It is not wrong to give tickets to leaders who have left the other party and joined the BJP
 philhal bhaajapa kii ranneeti or party kader kii upeksha ko lekar uth rahe sawaal ke bich sachaai yahi he ki modi ke naam par maahaul to banataa dikh rahaa he lekin maahaul ko seat jeetne laayak tabhi banaaya ja saktaa he jab cheharaa (pratyaashee) bhi kaddavar ho khaskar un jagahon par jahaan mukaable main virdohi kheme se kaddavar netaa khadaa ho
 Party insiders claim that this is what the BJP is doing, whether it is the struggle to save its seat in Uttar Pradesh or the intention of feeding lotus in states like West Bengal or Odisha
 ab dekhnaa he, party kii yah ranneeti kargar hoti he, kaadaron kii upeksha uske liye baari padataa he

 Every claim made by Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan on the roads of the state has been in constant discussion
 shivaraj kai baar yah daawa kar chuke hai ki madhya pradesh kii sadaken america se kam nahin hai
 On 1 August also, during an event, Shivraj Singh reiterated his statement that i once again say that the roads in Madhya Pradesh are no less than the US
 shivaraj ke is bayaan ke 3 din ke baad hi madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri karyaalay dwaara soshal media par share kiya gaya ek bayaan subah ke mukhyamantri ke bayaan kaa majaak udaata najar aa rahaa he
 The statement of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister's office on social media is now going viral
 darasal, 4 agast ko madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri karyaalay ke twitor handle dwaara ek post kiya gaya tha, jisamen rajya sarkaar dwaara tikaakaran abhiyaan kii tarif main kaside padhe gaye
 But this exposed the roads in Madhya Pradesh under Shivraj government
 madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri daftar kii twitor handle se kiye gaye post main likhaa tha ki chhatarpur ke kharyani, sukhwaha sahit 3 duurastha gram tak swasthya vibhaag kii team dwaara tikaakaran karne ke saath madhyapradesh ne tikaakaran ke # missionindradhanush main shat-pratishat safalataa praapt kar lee he
 Due to lack of roads, the team crossed the jungle and other obstacles by walking 10 km
 post ke ant main new india kaa hashtag lagaaya gaya he, lekin isi new india ke daawey main madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri karyaalay ne yah bhi bataaya ki kaise tikaakaran karne vaale karmchaariyon ko sadak na hone kii vajah se 10 kilometre paidal, phir jangal ke raste ek durgam gaanv main pahunchnaa padaa
 That is, there are also villages in Madhya Pradesh where there are no roads to go and the employees had to walk
 andaja lagaaie ki us ilaake ke logon koshivraj singhke raaj main pichley dedh dashakon main sadakon kaa kitna sukh mila hoga
 Yet Shivraj says that the roads in Madhya Pradesh are better than the US
 kya shivaraj ke raaj kii tarj par america main aisi koi jagah he jahaan sadak hi nahin he? Infamous gangster Anandpal Singh of Rajasthan was cremated on Thursday
 police prashasan ne kareeb 20 din baad kadi suraksha ke bich anandapal kaa antim sanskaar karaayaa
 After Anandpal's death, will Lady Don Anuradha Chaudhary alias Anurag, now called gang's command number two, get the command of 'gangs of Shekhawati'? This name is very famous in the world of crime
 koi ise gangster to koi ladi don ke rup main jaanata he
 Anuradha is considered a kidnapping expert
 anuraadhaa mul rup se sikar sthit rani sati road kii rahane vaali he
 Anuradha completed her studies from Sophia School in Ajmer
 emb kar chuki he ladi downuradhaa choudhary jaipur ke ek bade parivaar se taalluk rakhti he
 Anuradha, who has done MBA, is knowledgeable in many languages
 farrotedaar angreji bolne vaali anuraadhaa apniprabhaavshaalee shakhsiyatke dam par hi anandapal ke kareeb ai thi
 Actually Anuradha started her work by investing money in the stock market
 share market main dub gaya paisashare market main kaaphi paisa doobane ke baad uske upar kaaphi karj chadh gaya
 After the money crunch, Anuradha Chaudhary came into active role in gangster Anandpal's gang and upon seeing it, she became involved in the world of crime
 aksar western kapadon main dikhne vaali lambii kad-lathi kii ye ladi don baari suraksha ke ghere main rahati thi
 The kidnapping of the main witness's brother On June 27, 2006, the police were actively searching for Anuradha in the kidnapping case of Indranchand, brother of Pramod Chaudhary, the main witness in the famous Jeevanram Godara murder case
 june, 2016 main anuraadhaa ko jaipur se giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 The story of Anuradha being caught is no less interesting
 rangadari nahin di to kar liya aparandarasal ek baar sikar ke ek vyapaaree ne anuraadhaa ko rangadari nahin di to vah uskaa apharan kar use apane thikaane laa rahi thi
 The police got a glimpse of it and Anuradha was caught on the way
 tab se vah jaipur kii central jail main band he
 He is facing dozens of criminal prosecutions in Sikar, Nagaur, Bikaner and Ajmer
 court-kachhari sambhalati thi anuradhapulice sutara bataate hai kianandpal ke gangmein shaamil hone ke baad padhai-likhaai main acchhee hone kii vajah se court-kachhari se lekar aparaadh kii planning kaa jimmaa bhi anuraadhaa par hi rahata tha
 After Anandpal went to jail, the responsibility of the gang fell on Anuradha
 vah anandapal se milane jail main bedadak aati-jaati rahati thi
 Is the responsibility of the gang now on the shoulder of Lady Dawn? Anuradha is facing many cases related to murder, Orms Act, kidnapping and illegal liquor
 philhal anandapal kii maut ke baad gang kii jimmedaari anuraadhaa par aa gai he lekin jis tarah se rajasthan police nami badmaashon kaa khaatmaa karne par amada he, usase jaan padataa he ki anuraadhaa ke liye is gang ko chalaanaa kaaphi chunauti bharaa rahegaa

 Asking questions to Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopananda of Dwarka Peeth cost a journalist dearly
 jabalpur main ek patrkaar ne jaise hi shankaracharya swami swaroopanand se ye sawaal poocha ki narendra modi or arvind kejariwal main behatar piem koun? isi par bhadak gaye or patrkaar ko thappad jad diya

 He said, 'A man asked us about Modi

 Political people are such that they do evil

 Madhya Pradesh Congress leader Manak Agarwal said, 'political questions should not be asked to saints and saints

 Sometimes, asking questions out of religion leads to anger

 police ke mutabik, shikayatakarta sultan ne bataaya ki vah hyderabad se grajuation kar rahaa he
 He was looking for a luxury car on OLX

 aaropee ne shikayatakarta ko car kii delivery lene ke liye paise ke saath dilli main ajmeri get aane ko kaha
 On 3 September 2019, the complainant came to Ajmeri Gate, Delhi, along with his three brothers, where he met the accused and his friends
 iske baad kareeb 2
 15 lakhs were given in cash and the remaining money was also transferred
 gaadi kii delivery ke bare main poochne par aaropee mehataab ne shikayatakarta ko bataaya ki agle din gaadi kii enosi use mil jaaegi
 The accused, who was carrying money and car, took the complainant, Mahatab, the complainant and his brothers to a hotel in Paharganj area
 haalanki, 4 sitambar kii subah jab shikayatakarta or uske bhai so rahe the tab aaropee va uskaa dost car ke saath hotel se bhaag gaye

 After this, the police team reached the spot and caught both the accused from their homes
 saath hi mehataab ke chachaa ke naam par panjikrut fortuner car ko bhi jabt kar liya gaya
 Both the accused persons were constantly being questioned, in which they revealed that they were engaged in agricultural work in Meerut
 ve panchayat chunaav ladanaa chaahate hai, jiske liye unhen paise kii jarurat thi
 However, his income from agriculture was not enough
 isliye ve aasaani se paise kamaane kii khoj rahe the
 Meanwhile, Mahtab's uncle tells him that he wants to sell his Fortuner car and needs a suitable buyer from him
 nyaayik hiraasat main donon aaropiaropiyon ne ise chunaav ladane ke liye moti rakam kamaane ke maukey ke rup main liya
 He uploaded the pictures of the car on the OLX website and also kept a very cheap amount for the sale of the car

 Both the accused have been sent to judicial custody
 telugu desham party (tidipi) ne neshnal democratic elliance (endie) gathbandhan se alag hone kaa faisla le liya he
 The party Politburo has taken this decision unanimously
 tidipi ne bijepi par andhra pradesh ke saath anyaay karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Explain that the TDP has withdrawn its support from the NDA due to Andhra Pradesh not being given special status
 tidipi saansad vaai es choudhary ne kaha ki jaldi hi adhikarik taur par bijepi ko isaki jaankaree bhej di jaaegi
 Also, the TDP has announced a motion of no-confidence in the Lok Sabha today
 tidipi ke endie se samarthan waapas lene par bijepi netaa jiviel narsimha raav ne ajtak se kaha ki yah ek political propaganda he jiske tahat yah sabit karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he ki centre sarkaar rajya ke liye kuch nahin kar rahi
 He said that this is a political propaganda adopted to preserve its existence in the state
 bhaajapa par iskaa koi asar nahin hoga
 12,476 as special assistance to Andhra Pradesh by the Central Government on Thursday
 76 karod rupe jari karne kaa elaan kiya tha
 Of this, 2500 crores was kept for the new capital city
 haalanki, tidipi lagaataar is baat ko doharaati rahi he ki centre ne andhra pradesh ke saath anyaay kiya he or apane vaadon ko puraa nahin kiya he
 The TDP says that the central government has failed to meet the assurances given in the Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha main piem ne andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kaa aashwaasan diya tha
 The party says that an alliance with the BJP was done so that justice could be done with Andhra Pradesh, but it did not happen
 andhra ko nahin milegaa special statesisse pehle andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene se inkaar karte hue vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha tha ki andhra pradesh ko special states ke aadhaar par hi special package diya jayega
 Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said that the main thing about giving special status to Andhra Pradesh is why special status is given to a state? Jaitley said that according to the Finance Commission, there is a provision of special status only for the states of north-east as they have very limited resources of their own
 centre ke saamne kya he dikkatajetali ne bataaya tha ki chaudaaven vitt ayog ne rajyon ke liye special states ke praavdhaan ko hataa diya
 Hence, Andhra cannot be given special status status on this basis
 lihaaja kendra sarkaar or rajya sarkaar ne faisla kiya ki 5 saal tak 90-10 fisadi ke formule ke aadhaar par andhra pradesh ko special package diya jayega
 But Andhra can no longer be granted special status
 himachal pradesh main mandi jile kii drang vidhansabha seat congress kaa majboot garh he
 Drang is such a seat in Himachal where Congress leader Kaul Singh has been winning continuously for the last eight elections
 lekin is baar kii drang kii chunavi phija badali hui he
 This time, his own political disciple Chand Thakur has rebelled against the Congress candidate against Thakur Kaul Singh
 yahi vajah he ki drang vidhansabha kii siyaasi jang dilachasp ban gai he
 Kaul Singh is considered a very strong leader of the Congress
 wo congress main kai baar mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar rahe, lekin virbhadra singh ke chalate baaji unke haath nahin lagi
 Kaul Singh was once defeated in politics by bjp's Deenanath Shastri in 1990
 iske baad se unhen ajtak koi maat nahin de sakaa he
 Kaul Singh is said to be the Messiah of the development of the throne
 himachal kaa sabase bada or kathin vidhansabha kshetra hone ke baavjood thakur kaul singh ne apane raajnneetik kad kaa prayog karte hue yahaan vikaas kaaryon main koi kasar nahin chodi
 This is the reason why this seat remains the impregnable fort of the Congress
 drang vidhansabha kaa siyaasi sameekaran is baar badla hua najar aa rahaa he
 He is seen surrounded by the political disciple of Kaul Singh landing against him in the political arena
 unki sabase badi pareshaani unke hi raajnneetik chele purna chand thakur hai jo vartmaan main pradesh congress ke upaadhyaksh hote hue bhi baagi hokar maidan main utar gaye hai
 On the other hand, for the first time the BJP has also united here
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav menkaul sinhane mahaj 2232 voton ke antar se jeet darj kii thi
 In such a situation, the rebellion of Purna Chand Thakur and the unity of BJP is increasing the problem of Kaul Singh Thakur
 pichley do baar chunaav haar chuke jawahar thakur par bijepi ne ek baar phir daanv lagaaya he
 Whereas Ramesh Sharma and Brigadier Khushal Thakur, who were opponents in his party, have also come together this time
 jawahar thakur ke sandarbh main ullekhneey baat ye he ki vah is chunaav main jitne pratyaashee maidan main hai, unamem sabase kam padhe likhe hai
 He is just ninth pass
 lekin lambey samay se raajnneeti main sakriy rahane kii vajah se janata ke bich janaa-pahachaanaa naam hai
 Kaul Singh has no claim to the post of Chief Minister as Rahul Gandhi declared Virbhadra Singh as the Chief Ministerial candidate from the dais at the October 7 Kirandi rally
 iske alaava kaul singh kii ek pareshaani yah bhi he ki is baar unke samarthakon ko jile main tikat bhi hasil ho gaye hai
 They are all busy in their respective areas
 jeet darj karne kii jimmedaari unke khud ke kandhon par he
 In such a situation, it will have to be seen whether Kaul Singh creates history or whether the BJP succeeds in making a distinction in his fort

 parivaar ke mukhiya purna prakaash ne patwa samaaj ke faisle ke khilaaf police se lekar maanavadhikaar tak kaa darwaja khatkhataya lekin aaj bhi ek parivaar apane hi samaaj se alag he
 The Patwatoli Mohalla of Gaya, which keeps echoing with the voice of the powerloom, but in these voices the sobs of a family are suppressed
 purna prakaash kaa parivaar aaj bhi is mohalle main rahakar bhi nahin rah rahaa he
 In fact, he refused to give the land of his ancestors to the Patwa Committee
 ghatana 1998 kii he jab purna prakaash ne purvajon kii jameen naa dene se sirf manaa hi nahin kiya balki nyaayalay kaa darwaja bhi khatkhataya
 Since then, the entire Patwa Toli has been boycotting the family of Purna Prakash

 Purna Prakash says that in our caste, marriage also takes place in this locality
 meri bhi shaadi hui thi
 But we in-laws and children cannot go to their maternal grandparents' house
 yahaan tak ki agar raste main mili to bhi baatcheet par pratibandh laga he
 Even if you talk secretly, then the family will be evicted from the caste like me
 jiskaa dar hamen or parivaar waalon ko bhi he
 Although 80 percent of Patwa people are against the decree of Shri Durga ji Patwai Caste Reform Committee, but no one showed courage

 Congress leaders pay themselves for how much money they pay per day, but the truth is that in any part of the country, there is not enough food available at the rate of leaders and the police of Uttar Pradesh has been detained for the last decade
 The person is giving a full meal in the government standard of five rupees, and according to this standard, the government of the state has also been paying
 haalanki bhojan ke is paanch rupee main bhi police khel karti rahati he, kyonki zyaadaatar thanon ke hawalaton main band vyakti ke bhojan kaa intjaam uske parijan hi karte hai
 According to Banda Additional Superintendent of Police, Swami Prasad, a decade ago, there was a provision of only two rupees per dose from the government for the food of the detained person, later this amount has been increased to five rupees in view of inflation
 
 rakam thana prabhariyon ko uplabdh kara di jaati he
 Swami Prasad says, "given the skyrocketing inflation today, this amount is not even cumin in the camel's mouth, but there has been no increase in this amount for a decade

 ek bhi din police ne khaanaa nahin diya
 On the third day, his family arrived with food, then hunger went away

 Now that Amit Shah has got the responsibility of the Home Ministry in the Modi government, will the bad days of infiltrators begin in Bengal? The BJP has been calling for the implementation of National Citizenship Registration (NRC) in Bengal to eject infiltrators, while West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has been openly opposing it
 yahaan tak ki enarasi ke masale mamata banerjee or bijepi netritv main aamane-saamne kii bayaanbaji bhi dekhne ko mili thi

 modi sarkaar satta main aegi to ham bengal main enarasi laaenge, har ghuspaithiye kii pahchaan kii jaaegi or use baahar kiya jayega
 At the same time, Shah has also said that there is no need for Hindu and Buddhist refugees to leave the country

 NRC was issued on 30 July 2018, with a total of 3
 30 karod kii aabaadi main se 2,89,83,677 logon ko naagarikta register main shaamil kiya gaya tha

 Amit Shah has often raised the issue of infiltrators in Bengal during the election campaign
 saath hi yah bhi kehete rahe hai ki jo bhi hindu yaa buddha sharnaarthi baahar se aae hai, unhen sammaan diya jayega jabaki baaki ghuspaithiyon ko chun-chunakar baahar kiya jayega

 But here Babaji was wiring the ghats
 clipings main sirf pati-patni hote to bhi ganimat thi, vahaan to naaballig bacchon se lekar pashu yoni ke praani bhi kuntha kaa shikaar najar aa rahe the
 When the matter was exposed, there was a ruckus in the religion

 a case was registered under Section 377 of unnatural sex on a fake monk and Section 67B of the IT Act

 Baba Hathayogi of Haridwar says about this new culture that is flourishing in the field of religion, not every saffron is a monk
 samaaj ko dhongiyon ke prati sajag rahanaa chahie
 On the question that during the last few years, many eminent babas have been caught up in cases like sex scandals, murder and property disputes and many of the Mahants themselves have been murdered over a decade in Haridwar due to a property dispute, Hathayogi said, "as far as Talking about sex scandal, i would only say that this weakness is very old
 sex manushya kii moolbhoot jarurat he or bahut kam hi sanyasi hai jo is par niyantran rakh saken
 "furthering his argument, Baba says," Maharishi Vishwamitra's mind was also enamored with the nymph named Maneka

 But then the monks did not hide these relations
 aaj ke saadhuon main apni kamajori swikaarne kii takat nahin he, isiilie unke kisse jab saamne aate hai to aapaki bhashaa main scandle ban jate hai
 “many temples, monasteries have been places of refuge for monks and sages in Haridwar, Rishikesh and Kashi, but it is not the case that Kali Yuga has not entered the Dharmnagar
 rishikesh main jahaan ganga ke ghat khatm hote hai vahaan ek taraf baba mastaram kaa ghat he or duusari taraf churaasi kutiyaa he
 In both these places you will find a group of such babas whose spirituality does not go beyond the power of Chillam
 inaki pehali praathamikta firangi mahilaayein hoti hai, jinhen ye bade athmiya dhang se chilam kaa kas lagavate najar aate hai
 Due to being a little away from the population, the foreign tourists on the sand ghats of Mastram keep their day full of sulpha and ganja
 sthaneey logon kii maane to churaasi kutiyaa ke aasapaas baniin jhuggiyaan darasal nashe ke avaidh kaarobaar kii chowkiyaan hai
 Regarding such nature of tourists, Swami Chidananda Saraswati of Paramarth Niketan says, "our ashram attracts a large number of foreign devotees
 aap puri dincharya kaa khud adhyayan karen to yahaan yoga or dhyaan ke alaava kuch nahin dikhaai degaa
 Drugs are prohibited in the ashram
 ” ve shant bhav se aagaah karte hai, ''pichley do dashak main dharm ke kshetra main khub dhan aayaa he
 One reason for this is that religious people want to spread the religion
 lekin dhongi sadhu aise logon se paisa anthne main lage hai
 It is a shraddha of reverence
 isse saavdhaan rahanaa padegaa
 “even in Kashi, saints and ascetics are being viewed with suspicion
 tirth purohit bhaau acharya todpe kehete hai, ''varanasi main aise baabaaon kii acchhee-khaasi taadaad he, jo videshi mahilaon ke saath shaareerik sambandh sthapit karte hai
 "he claims that" the job of some of the Gerua clothmen in the eighties area of kashi is to have physical relations with foreign women
 ”ashramon or baabaaon ke jivan main bad rahi bhavyata or pani kii tarah bahata paisa to sadhu mahatmaon ke galat gatividhiyon main lipt hone kaa kaaran to nahin? is sawaal par chidanand saraswati kehete hai ki jahaan divyata honi chahie vahaan bhavyata aa rahi he
 After coming so close to happiness, enjoyment, it does not take much time for the windows of mind restraint to open
 saadhuon ko is bare main sajag rahanaa chahie
 Saraswati says, "A few years ago a channel did a sting of sadhus who whiteen black money
 ve log mere paas bhi aae the lekin maine manaa kar diya
 With the sting, i should have shown them and those sadhus who are not ready for wrongdoing
 satya tukdon main nahin dikhaaya ja saktaa, vah samgr hi hota he
 In the same way, the entry of wealth in religion is also happening in totality
 kaashi main karmkand kaa tarika ab hotel or loj ke raste bhi tay hone laga he
 The managers of the hotel and lodge are now deciding which priest to stay with their priest to perform rituals

 Now the benefit to the judges is that you can choose the package by booking your booking from the Internet itself

 a large number of fake pandas are also performing rituals in Kashi
 varanasi ke tirth purohit bhaau acharya todpe bataate hai ki ganga ke kinare basane vaali jatiyaan jaise mallaah, nishad, nai jati se jude log bhi pande kaa rup dhaaran kar karmkand karvaa rahe hai
 It is not possible to keep an eye on such people because there is no monitoring organization of people associated with rituals
 yahi vajah he ki ganga ke kinare karmkand karaane ke rate bhi alag-alag hai
 500 for Pindadan seeing the status of Yajaman

 By the way, sadhus also become victims
 pichley saal haridwar ke mahanirvaani akhaade main ek sadhu sudhir giri kii hatya kar di gai
 After the murder, condoms and similar material were found from Giri's room, which is not expected to meet any monk
 is hatyakand ke bare main akhaade ke sachiv mahant rabindra puri ne zyada baat karne se manaa kar diya
 In Puri's words, the case is in court
 aap jis taraf ishaara kar rahe hai ve baaten main apane munh se nahin kah saktaa
 On the broad question of wrongdoing coming in the religion, he said that money has also come to the ashram trusts according to the time, but the status of the Mahant is that of the manager who conducts the religious work

 Confrontation of tradition and modernity is prominently visible among Muslims

 bhaajapa baar-baar apane netaaon dwaara gandhi ji kii vichaardhaara or soch par kutsit hamale bol rahi he
 It is a disgusting BJP conspiracy to defy the Gandhian core principles of India
 yah ek akshamya aparaadh he
 Insulting the martyrs and great personalities of the country has become a culture of the BJP
 unhone kaha ki isse pehle modi-amit shah kii chaheti pragna thakur ne 26 / 11 aatanki hamale ke shahid hemanth karkare ji ko deshadrohi bataa, unke parivaar ko shraap dene kaa akshamya aparaadh kiya tha
 Instead of withdrawing his candidature, Modi defended Pragya Thakur in TV interviews
 isi saal baapu ke 71wein balidaan diwas par sangh ke ek sanghathan ne baapu kii hatya ko phir se chitrit karne kaa ghor paap kiya
 Even Godse shot at Gandhi's effigy with an air pistol

 Instead of punishing them, Modi ji goes to Ratlam and appeals to win them

 Uma Bharti tweeted, 'prime Minister Narendra Modi has given a comprehensive interview which also has the issue of Ram temple

 He said that Modi's remarks do not stall the path of temple construction as the option of temple construction is open through dialogue with various groups

 Yogi's two ministers have come face to face with a ban on 20% minority quota in Uttar Pradesh
 jahaan alpsankhyak maamalon ke mantri ne cote par roak kaa bayaan diya to vahiin samaaj kalyaan mantri ramapati shastri ne alpsankhyak cote par roak se inkaar kiya he
 There is no proposal to abolish the quota
 Earlier, Minister of Minority Affairs Mohsin Rajane talked about abolishing the quota, now Social Welfare Minister Ramapati Shastri has denied it
 unhone kaha he ki kota khatm karne kaa koi prastaav nahin he
 On Monday morning, Minority Affairs Minister Mohsin Raza raised the slogan of Kota Mukti, and by evening social welfare minister Ramapathi Shastri refused to stop
 2012 main hui alpsankhyakon ko kota dene kii shuruankhilesh yadav sarkaar ne 85 yojanaon mechalpsankhyakon ke liye20 fisadi cote kaa praavdhaan kiya tha
 The quota of minorities in Akhilesh government's schemes was started in 2012, under which 20 percent quota was fixed for minorities in 85 schemes of the state government
 pramukh vibhaagon main alpsankhyakon ko cote kaa phaaydasbase zyada kota samaaj kalyaan or gram vikaas main he
 In areas where at least 25 percent of the population consists of minorities, there are instructions to strictly implement the schemes
 swasthya lok nirmaan, sinchai, urja, laghu udyog, khaadi gramodyog, panchayat raaj or chikitsa jaise pramukh vibhaagon main alpsankhyakon ko cote kaa phayda mil rahaa he
 Yogi Adityanath has scrapped many schemes of Akhilesh government ever since Yogi became the scissors cm on many schemes of Akhilesh government
 usee kadi main ab ek mantri ke bayaan par alpsankhyak kota khatm kiye jane kii atakalein lagaai ja rahi thim
 The Central Minorities Commission is running without a president
 While many states of the country are being set up for minorities, many schemes of the previous government for minorities in UP are being scrapped and the minority commission of the country has been for the last three months
 Only the name remains
 lagata he bharat kaa alpsankhyak ayog bhi ram bharose hi chal rahaa he
 UP Chief Minister Adityanath Yogi has made it clear that many policies of the previous government applicable to minorities will be abolished on the basis of merit and utility
 rahi baat desh ke alpsankhyak ayog kii to march maheene se ayog ke paas naa to koi adhyaksh he or naa hi koi sadsy
 There is only one IAS officer secretary who has been on medical leave for a long time

 ayog ke sutron kii maane to upie sarkaar ne jate-jate naseem ahamed ko teen saal ke liye alpsankhyak ayog kaa adhyaksh bana diya tha
 Naseem Ahmed's tenure ended in March 2017
 ab tak nayaa adhyaksh nahin aayaa
 It is a matter of the members of other minority communities, the tenure of Sardar Ajayib Singh, the representative of the Sikh community, ended a year and a half ago
 muslim samudaay kii numaaindgi karne vaali farida khan july 2016 main hi ritair ho gayi

 Stay hungry and thirsty throughout the summer months of Ramadan and offer prayers on time
 samay par sehari khaanaa or shaam ke samay sahi vakt par iftaar lenaa
 This whole month of Ramadan is very special for Muslims, but a person from Rajasthan broke his fast just because a woman needed blood
 ramadan ke maheene main garibon ko daan karnaa or madad karnaa acha mana jaataa he, lekin kisi zaruratmand ke liye roza todane jaisi ghatana bahut kam dekhi he
 Actually, a pregnant woman in Alwar, Rajasthan was in dire need of blood
 ashraf khan naam ke is vyakti ne insaaniyat dikhaai or mahila ko khun dene ke liye apana rojaa tod diya
 Ramadan's last jumma, know how it is celebrated before Eid

 ashraf khan ke mutabik, "mujhe phone par massej aayaa ki ek aadmi ko apni saali ke liye tunrat bi blad group kaa khun chahie
 i immediately called the man and said that i would come after Iftar in the evening, but the man told me that the doctor asked for blood as soon as possible, because his sister is pregnant
 "phir kya tha ashraf khan tunrat hospital pahunche or unhone apana roza tod mahila ko khun dekar uski or uske bachche kii jaan bachaai

 But the biggest surprise was that Kapil Sharma, a friend of Kapil since college days, and his friend Chandan Prabhakar, who supported Kapil Sharma, a superhit from Sturgler, were also left alone after the fight
 lekin lagata he chandan ke sho se duuri banane kii vajah flite kaa jhagada nahin balki kuch or hi he

 Input from language Aarey Case: mumbai ke aare (aarey)main ped kaate jane ke maamle main supreme court ne philhal yathasthiti barkaraar rakhane kaa faisla diya he
 That is, no more trees will be cut
 somvaar ko hui sunwaayee main supreme court ne mumbai nagar nikaayon se poocha he ki kitne ped kaate gaye hai or uske badale main kitne nae paudhe lagaae gaye hai
 Also, it is also asked how many trees are left in the area
 supreme court ne tasviren dikhaane kii bhi maang kii he
 The Supreme Court said that we want to see not just this area but the whole region
 supreme court ne metro or mumbai corporation se poocha he ki kya is ilaake main koi vyavsaayik project bhi prastaavit he ? darasal yachikakartaon ne aarope lagaaya tha ki vahaan par or bhi imaaraten banaai jaani hai
 The Supreme Court has said that at present, the project of Metro car shed can continue and there is no restriction on its construction
 metro ke liye pesh mukul rohtagi ne kaha ki kul 2600 ped kaate gaye the or aage koi ped nahin kaate gaye hai
 He said that more than 400 saplings have been planted and as many are to be transplanted
 rohtagi ne saaf kiya ki aare colony main kataai sirf metro car shed ke liye hui or yahaan koi vyavsaayik gatividhi nahin hogi
 Mukul Rohatgi has given the example of Delhi Metro, stressing the need of metro for Mumbai
 unhone kaha ki jaise dilli main 67 lakh log metro main safar karte hai to saat lakh vaahan sadak se hat gaye hai
 However, Justice Arun Mishra said that noise pollution is also very high in Delhi, especially in the Supreme Court

 Advocate Manohar Lal Sharma had contended in the contempt petition that this officer had only acted on the order of the apex court to demolish the illegal structure and in such a situation the action of the state government to suspend Nagpal is contempt of court
 nyaayadhishon ne sawaal kiya ki rajya sarkaar kii karrwai avmaananaa kaise hui
 The judges said that the authorities themselves have not taken any decision regarding the apex court order prohibiting the construction of religious buildings on public land illegally
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki avmaananaa yachika kaaphi jaldi daakhil kii gayi he kyonki rajya sarkaar ne hi durga shakti nagpal ko diye gayi aarope patr par abhi koi antim nirnay nahin liya he
 The court said that the contempt case will be raised only after this officer has filed the reply to the charge sheet and the final decision of the state government is taken
 sharma ne is yachika main uttar pradesh ke mukhya sachiv javed osmani, kaaryakari mukhya sachiv alok ranjan or kendra sarkaar ko prativaadee banaaya tha
 The contempt petition said that the action against 28-year-old Nagpal was in contempt of the apex court's order to stop the illegal construction of religious structures at the public site
 sharma ne 2010 batch kii bhartiya prashasnic seva kii is adhikari kii bahaali or uske khilaaf sari kaarywahi nirast karne ke liye daayar janhit yachika 16 agast ko khaarij hone ke baad yah nyaayalay kii avmaananaa yachika daayar kii thi

 With the beginning of the new year, political opponents in Bihar were also seen praising each other, while the love of their political supporters like Lalu Prasad Yadav towards the Congress which is seen moving towards the slopes across the country remains intact
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ko chhodkar baaki sabhi partiyaan kiske saath haath milaayengi, kahana mushkil he
 Alam of contradiction remains intact
 lok janashakti party (algepi) pramukh ramvilas paswan par nitish kumaar or lalu prasad, donon netaa dore daalate najar aae
 LJP won only 6 in 2009 Lok Sabha election without winning any seat
 55 fisadi vot juta pai thi
 He contested 12 Lok Sabha seats
 paswan ne saaf jaahir kar diya he ki argedy main algepi ke liye bahut kam siten chode jane kii baat uthne se ve naakhush hai
 Paswan is technically still with RJD
 algepi ne jedy (you) ke saath kisi len-dein kii baat jaahir na karte hue congress ke saath gathbandhan kii ichha jataai he
 If all three are aligned then LJP can get new life in Bihar
 gathbandhan ke sawaal par paswan ne sayaani chaal chali he or kisi bhi tarah kii patibaddhta se bachane kii koshish kii he
 That is why he left the decision to the Congress, which won only 2 seats in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 paswan ne gend congress ke paale main daal di he to apane rajnatik bhavishya main ufaan dekh rahe lalu yadav bhi congress ko khush rakhane ke liye kisi bhi had tak kadam badhaane ko taiyaar najar aa rahe hai
 Actually BJP is the only party which has no illusions in Bihar
 bhagava party kii rashtriya lok samta party ke upendra kushvaha ke saath do siton par aapasi sahmati ho yaa na ho, lekin use saaf taur par anya chaar pramukh partiyon—argedy, jedy (you), algepi or congress se muqabla karnaa he
 Both RJD and JD (U) are ready to join hands with Paswan
 duusari ore jedy (you) ne congress ke saath najdiki ke sanket die hai
 Paswan is confident that secular parties will come together in Bihar to prevent the BJP from forming a government at the Center after the election, whether it is before or not
 bihar main lagaataar dhalaan dekh chuki congress main sabaki dilchaspee isi vajah se he kyonki uske sahyogi zyada sankhya main alpsankhyak vot paane kii ummid kar sakate hai
 a senior Congress leader from Bihar says, "muslims know that the Third Front is just an illusion
" aise main congress hi aisi party bachati he jo narendra modi ko pradhanmantri banane se roak sakati he
 It is no surprise that Muslims will vote for the parties that will be seen supporting Congress
 '' bihar kii 16
 The Muslim population of 53 per cent can give preference to a party that has the ability to defeat the BJP at the national level
 lalu congress kaa samarthan paane ke liye kadi mashkkat kar rahe hai lekin jamini str par atoot gathbandhan khadaa karne main kai pareshaaniyaan hai
 For example, RJD leader Abdul Bari Siddiqui does not want to leave Madhubani seat for Congress
 ve vahaan 2009 ke chunaav main bijepi ke hukumdev narayan ke baad duusare number par rahe the
 He received 1,54,165 votes as against 1,11,420 votes of Congress's Shakeel Ahmed
 isi tarah purv kendriya mantri or argedy netaa taslimuddin kishanganj se laduya chaahate hai jahaan se congress ke mohammad anararul haq saansad hai
 Lalu will also have trouble leaving the Khagadia seat from where rjd's Ravindra Rana got 1,28,208 votes in the last Lok Sabha election while Mahbub Ali Kaiser of Congress got 1,27,493 votes
 vidambnaa yah he ki congress ne bihar main varshon pehle apni chunavi praasangikta kho di he, phir bhi do sabase bade kathith secular lalu or paswan usee ke saath gathbandhan kii ummid main hai
 Facts also point to this great irony
 1985 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress ne ekikrut bihar main 48 siten jiti thim
 At that time, Bihar had a total of 54 Lok Sabha seats
 2000 main bihar kaa bantwaaraa hone ke baad yahaan 40 loksabhaa siten bachiin
 The Congress won three seats in 2004 and only two in 2009
 2014 main uski haalat shaayad or patali ho jaati agar bijepi ne narendra modi ko maidan main nahin utaara hota
 Electoral mathematics has changed in Bihar
 nitish bijepi se alag hone ke baad ab ajey nahin rah gaye hai
 In 2009, JD (U) and BJP contested together and won 32 seats out of 40
 isi tarah lalu yadav or paswan congress kii yojana main shaamil hona chaahate hai, jabaki 2009 main donon ne aapas main deal karte hue congress ke liye sirf teen siten chodi thim
 When the Congress did not accept the bifurcation, the RJD had fielded candidates in those three seats as well
 congress ne phir sabhi siton par ummidavaar utaar donon kaa sameekaran bigaad diya or bijepi-jedy (you) gathbandhan ko baari jeet hasil hui
 Last week, people were surprised when Nitish showed unilateral warmth towards Paswan on 20 January
 janata darbar main paswan ke prati apana purana prem bataate hue unhone kaha, ''paswanji achche insaan hai
 i wanted to combine them in 2004 and 2005 but for some reasons could not be possible
 ''nitish kaa paswan ke prati prem unki kootneeti main achaanak aayaa badlaav he
 Nitish had made every effort to weaken the LJP in the last 9 years
 may, 2005 main jab nitish bahumat se thodi dur the tab unhone paswan ke baagi netaaon ko uksaa unhen apane paksh main kiya tha
 Soon after the Lok Sabha elections, in early 2009, Sanjay Singh, the only MLC of the LJP, announced the merger of the party with the Nitish government
 sanjay jo kabhi paswan ke bahut kareebi netaa the, philhal jedy (you) ke pravaktaa hai
 The LJP suffered a significant loss in the November 2010 assembly elections and won just three seats
 unamem se do vidhayak baad main jedy (you) main shaamil ho gaye
 In July 2011, JD (U) joined Paswan's three mlcs in the party
 nitish ne mahadalit ayog banaakar or sirf paswan kii jati ko chhod anya sabhi dalit jatiyon ko mahadalit main shaamil karke unhen kamjor kiya
 With this Nitish gained the votes of most of the Dalit castes and Paswan remained as the leader of his caste only
 nitish ke tarif karne ke agle hi din paswan ne bhi unhen dhanyavad dete hue kaha, ''main nitish kumaar kii apane prati garmjoshi or achche bol ke liye dhanyavad detaa hum
 We are old friends
 '' lekin lalu ne bhi paswan ko sachcha insaan bataaya
 He said, "we have a great relationship with Paswanji
" ham sampark main hai or gathbandhan banaaenge
 "on the other hand, Paswan is waiting for the Congress to step in before opening its cards
" ek varisht algepi netaa bataate hai, ''congress ko faisla karnaa he ki bihar main secular gathbandhan main argedy hoga yaa jedy (you)
 We will go with the Congress

 Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Arun Jaitley has accused the Lokpal report submitted by the Parliamentary Standing Committee of ignoring parliamentary sentiment
 lokapal ke mudde par puri sansad ne jo vaayada kiya he, usase mukara nahin ja saktaa
 Jaitley, who arrived on the occasion of Anna Hazare's ODI fast, said in his address that when Annaji broke his previous fast, at that time both the houses of Parliament showed their sentiments including appointment of Lokayukta within the states, Citizen's Charter, lower The level of bureaucracy was said to be brought under the purview of Lokpal, but the report of the Standing Committee is not in the spirit of Parliament

 How can the promise made by the entire Parliament be broken? jetali ne kaha ki sansadeey loktantr main janata kii bhi aawaaj he
 Law is of course made in Parliament but public opinion is also a thing

 Some topics related to this can be discussed, but the soul of Lokpal cannot be ignored
 jetali ne kaha ki sthaayee samiti main hamaare dal ke jo sadsy the, unhone asahmati ke note ke saath apane vichaar rakhe hai
 Our opinion is clear that the Prime Minister should be under the purview of Lokpal and only Group a and b officers should be in its purview and officers of c and d Group will be excluded from it, we are not going to accept it
 jetali ne sweekaar kiya ki sibiai kaa durupyog hota rahaa he isliye is sanstha ko nishpaksh banaaya janaa chahie taaki vah sarkaron ke haathon kaa khilonaa naa rahe
 CBI should also be placed under the purview of Lokpal

 Then the scene will be something like this

 His praise is getting great praise nowadays
 tharur:ye ye aap kya
 
 
 We have also lost in Haryana
 
 Digvijay Singh: It is wrong to question leadership
 ye koi baat nahin hui ki ham haare hai
 We have won theoretically in Haryana
 prithviraj chavaan:kya baat kahi he digvijay ji,or maharashtra main bhi bijepi ko janata ne sweekaara nahin he
 They have not got an absolute majority, understand this
 par media ko kya kahana he? ye modi lahar ke bare main 
 Sonia Gandhi: Say anything, but the Modi wave is nowhere
 kah denge ki ensipi ne dhokhaa diya
 Silently joined BJP at the last moment
 rahul gandhi:sab mili hue hai ji
 Prithviraj Chavan: He is one, he was the nephew of Pawar ji, when he was with us, he used to speak a lot, "the water is not coming in the dam, 'he will do it'

 Salman Khurshid: Look, Tharoor saheb is all about politics, you should pay attention to Twitter
 janata badlaav chaahati thi isliye haare
 Do you also have trending topics change or not? Ajay Maken: But what about Haryana? Was there a hat-tricker or not, Hooda Sahab? Hooda: Hat-trick was only a handicap
 sonia gandhi:modi to mushkil se vahaan gaye the, do-chaar reliyaan kii,vikaas vaale bhaashan die or aap vahaan do baar se the, itane saalon main jameen se judakar koi kaam nahin kiya?hooda (khisiakar):‘jameen’ se jude kaam hi to karte the madam,wadra ji se puch lijie,unhi ke saath to kiye hai

 hooda:ab ye sab na puuchhie plis
 Allowances made the kiln more, no use be the Chief Minister, listen to everyone, someone throws a shoe, someone runs a hand
 hooting hoti he pradhanmantri ke saamne,ab haar gaye to bhi kaaran bataao,aapako jo kahana karnaa he kah dijiye mujhase ab ye sab na hoga
 Ajay Maken: Okay, okay, so let's come to the results that have to be told out
 kuch points nikal kar laae hai dhyaan se suniye
 After this, no one will ever talk about these results
 - party apni haar sweekaar karti he or janata ke faisle kaa sammaan karti he
 - The party has full confidence in the top leadership, Rahul Gandhi does not become responsible for the party's defeat in two states
 - haryana main janata badlaav chaahati thi isliye ham haare
 - In principle, the party has won
 - koi modi lahar nahi he
 The BJP not getting an absolute majority in Maharashtra suggests that the public is yet to trust them
 - ensipi jaise sahyogiyon ne dhokhaa diya varanaa ham kabhi na haarate 
 After losing in Haryana, we may not remain in power but will work by staying connected with 'land'

 In his address to the 64th World Health General Assembly, he said, 'I am overwhelmed by the popularity of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘nitish kumaar or nigeria ke polio unmoolan kaarykram ke pramukh mohammad pate ne dikhaa diya he ki shreshth netaa kisi bhi kharaab sthiti se paar paa sakate hai

 Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee has a good opinion about West Bengal
 unka maananaa he ki yah ''nivesh ke nae thikaane ke rup main ubhar rahaa he
 "but on April 1, at a seminar of the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India in Kolkata, his claim seems far from reality
 pashchim bengal se loksabhaa sadsy mukherjee ne apni daleel kii pushti ke liye asardaar aankade bhi pesh kar die
 He said, "as of December 2011, 6 in the state
 11 lakh karod ru
 There were about 900 investment projects underway
 yah sarkaar or privet sector dwaara desh main ghoshit kul nivesh kaa 4
 4 per cent
 ''ye aankade bhraamak ho sakate hai
 Given the size of West Bengal, its contribution to investment appears to be minimal
 vitt mantralay ke ek adhikari kehete hai, ''desh ke sakal gharelu utpaada (jidipi) main pashchim bengal kaa yogadan lagbhag 6
 5 percent
 isliye nivesh main uskaa hissaa 4
 Should be much higher than 4%
 ''mukherjee nivesh pariyojnaon kii sankhya ke bare main jo daawa karte hai, usamen chal rahi aisi pariyojnaayen shaamil hai jinke liye paisa aa chukaa he, iske alaava ve sahmati patr or ghoshnaaen bhi shaamil hai jinke liye rajya main abhi tak paisa nahin aayaa he
 Actually, mous and declarations do not always mean actual investment
 arthshaastri bibek debaroy kehete hai, ''jahaan kuch rajya sabhi ghoshnaaon ko vaastavik nivesh main badalane main safal rahete hai, vahiin khaastaur par is maamle main pashchim bengal kaa record kaaphi kharaab rahaa he
 Gujarat and Tamil Nadu have done quite well in this area
 ''debaroy kaa maananaa he ki vitt mantri kaa bayaan mahaj raajnneeti he or vah aarthik hakeekat se bilkul mail nahin khaataa
 Pointing to the recent tensions between the Congress and its largest ally, he said, "the Finance Minister is making such a statement to calm the leadership of the Trinamool Congress
" '' vitt mantri ke bhaashan ke centre main ek rajnatik sandesh tha
 Debroy said, "I am happy that the new government under the leadership of Mamata Banerjee is trying to fulfill the aspirations and expectations of the people
" ''may, 2011 main chune gaye chaar mukhyamantriyon main mamata pehali mukhyamantri thim jinhone 18 june, 2011 ko udyog jagat ke logon ke saath aupchaarik baatcheet kii
 But he dashed the hopes of industrialists by saying that his government would not help them in acquiring land
 nai sarkaar ne pehla vidhaan singur punarvaas evam vikaas adhinium adhishuchet kiya jisane singur main 2007 or 2008 main tata dwaara adhigrahit jameen ko waapas lene kaa adhikaar de diya
 The shadow of Singur is still scaring the industry
 centre for monitering da indian iconomi (siemii) ke siio mahesh vyas kehete hai, ''singur ke baad pashchim bengal ke liye nae nivesh kii ghoshnaaon main kami aa gai he
 1,64,100 crore in 2007-2008
 ke nivesh kii ghoshnaa kii gai thi jabaki 2008-09 main keval 91,200 karod ru
 Investment was announced
 ''siemii ke anusaar, mamata banerjee ke kaarykaal ke pehle saal 2011-12 main keval 43,000 karod ru
 There have been announcements of investment of about half of the amount announced in 2008-09
 udyog jagat ke ek varisht pratinidhi ne bataaya, ''main sirf itnaa hi jaanata hum ki pashchim bengal main udyogpati aana nahin chaahate, balki yahaan ke udyogpati baahar nikalnaa chaahate hai
 "even if Finance Minister Mukherjee is looking at the economic future of West Bengal quite brightly
 lekin aisa lagata he ki niveshak pradesh kii jamini sachaai se acchhee tarah waakif hai
 This could possibly be a reason for not showing interest in his state

 In the first week of November, the Delhi government presented the Delhi Statistical Handbook-2011 and the data in the booklet created some evidence that Delhi was seen as the Sirmaur city of the world
 aankadon kii baazeegari main dilli main har taraf khushhaali or tarakkee kii bahaar najar ai
 But on the basis of which figures are proving to be a picture of Delhi's progress, their land does not look very strong
 masalan sankhyikee pustika ke mutabik dilli main bason kii sankhya 61,471 he, jabaki khud mukhyamantri shila dikshit lambey samay se daawa karti rahi hai ki shahar main nijee or saarvajanik kshetra kii bason ko kisi tarah 11,000 tak pahunchaana he, taaki aam aadmi ko aane-jane main sahuuliyat ho
 According to the booklet, 88,181 auto rickshaws are registered in Delhi
 jabaki hakeekat yah he ki supreme court ke aadesh ke tahat dilli main auto rickshaw kii adhiktam sankhya 55,000 hi ho sakati he
 The Supreme Court has approved the addition of one lakh new autos about 10 days after the booklet arrives
 bason or auto rickshaw ke aankade sankhyikee pustika kii aankadebaaji kii baangi bhar hai
 According to the booklet, the population of the city at this time is 1
 68 karod he
 But the interesting thing is that this booklet shows that the number of TV viewers in the city is 1 in 2010 only
 8 karod ho chuki he, jabaki doordarshan dekhne waalon kii sankhya 1
 7 crores
 yani shahar kii jitani aabaadi nahin he, usase kareeb 20 lakh zyada log tivi dekh rahe hai
 But bypassing such figures, Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit while releasing the booklet projected the city as a symbol of growth, furthering the increased per capita income and increased number of mobile connections
 dikshit ne kaha, ''dilli desh kaa teesraa sabase adhik amir shahar ban gaya he
 Delhi is rapidly becoming an urban form and the rural population has declined by 55 per cent in the last decade
 ''tej shaharikaran kii misaal ke taur par vitt varsh 2010-11 main mobile conection kii sankhya 3
 Reaching 88 crores was projected as a large base, while the city's population was 1
 68 karod he
 That is, every two men in Delhi have an average of five mobile phone connections
 lekin sankhyikee pustika ne yah pataa lagane kii jahamat nahin farmaai ki inamen se kitne conection chaalu hai, kyonki yah janaa-mana tathy he ki mobile company ke tarriff package or apni jaruraton ke lihaaj se dilli vaale bahut teji se mobile sim badalte rahete hai
 How true the number of buses is can be understood from the latest statement of Delhi Transport Minister Arvinder Singh Lovely
 nai cluster bason ko ravaanaa karne ke maukey par 14 november ko lavali ne kaha, ''varrsh 2013 tak dilli sarkaar 11,000 bason kaa sanchaalan kar rahi hogi
 Out of these 6,000 buses will be cluster buses
 '' yani 2013 tak dilli main ditisi kii 5,000 or nijee kshetra kii companiyon kii 6,000 basen daudane kaa sarkari lakshya he
 Interestingly, at present DTC has 6,204 buses including old condom buses and out of these only 4,330 buses are able to hit the road daily
 yani transport ke maamle main 61,471 bason kaa sankhyikee aankada dur kii kaudi ke sivaay kuch nahin he
 a senior official of the transport department said, "the transport department has also recorded the buses registered decades ago in their records
 isiilie ye sankhya itani badi dikh rahi he
 Commenting on the statistics of the statistics booklet, State Bharatiya Janata Party President Vijender Gupta said, "sheila Dixit's government is resorting to data to push its back, while the reality is far from it
" 13 saal ke shashan main jansankhya badhane ke baavjood kangeras sarkaar garibon ko ghar muhaiyaa nahin kara pai he
 Under Rajiv Ratna Awas Yojana, not a single poor was provided a house
 1,639 anadhikrut coloniyon main se ek bhi colony ko niyamit nahin kiya gaya he
 According to the booklet, out of 33,79,956 houses in Delhi, 3,77,790 houses are lying vacant
 yani 10 fisadi makaan aise shahar main khaali pade hai, jahaan bahut se log footpath par sone ko majaboor hai
 Now who should tell the government that the thirst for truth is not extinguished by the data
 behatar hoga aankadon ko sachaai kii aanch par pakaa liya jaae
 bjp's outspoken leader Uma Bharti has today said that Narendra Modi is not a good speaker like Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 jhaansi se bijepi kii ummidavaar uma bharti ne kaha, 'vaajapeyi achche vaktaa the
 People say that there is no speaker like him in Indian politics
 agar aap dhyaan se sune, to aap paaenge ki narendra modi achche vaktaa nahin hai
 People do not come to hear him at Narendra Modi's rallies, but to tell that they want change in the country from them and they are with him
 ' Significantly, Uma Bharti, who was the Minister of Information and Broadcasting and Sports in the Vajpayee government, was expelled from the BJP in the year 2005 and since then she has been strongly critical of Narendra Modi

 She came in front of the camera in two different dresses, white and black, during the event
 apane simple or stylish luk ke liye kaaphi vaah wahi bhi batori
 But meanwhile, Deepika made a mistake

 Just this carelessness, this picture of Deepika was captured in the camera lens

 Let us tell you, Nirmala Sitharaman had said in Lok Sabha on Wednesday that the rising prices of onions have not affected her personally, because her family does not like things like onion-garlic
 sitaraman ne kaha, ''main bahut zyada pyaaj-lahasun nahin khaati
 
 
 So don't worry
 main aise parivaar se aati hum, jise pyaaj kii koi khaas parvaah nahin he
 However, people did not like his point on Twitter and due to this people started tweeting his statement differently
 ek yujar ne do photo ko share karte hue likhaa, ''PIC 1- pyaaj ke daamon ke bare main baat mat karon kyonki vitt mantri pyaaj nahin khaati
 
 
 PIC 2- Yes, Smriti Irani eats onions but when the Congress government is in power
 
 
 un logon kaa kya jo bijepi sarkaar ke vakt pyaaj khate hai''
 Pic 1- Don't talk about # onionprice because our FM # nirmalasitharaman don't eat onions Pic 2- Yes, Smriti Irani eat Onions but only when there is Govt of Congress

 With that logic: hindu dharm main kuch bhi shubh kaam karne se pehle muhoort jarur dekha jaataa he
 Actually, it is believed that Panchang must be seen before any auspicious work
 panchang ek pracheen hindu calendar ko kaha ja saktaa he
 The almanac is made up of the word five limbs
 ham ise panchang isliye kehete hai kyonki yah paanch pramukh angon se bana he
 Those are the five major organs - Nakshatra, Tithi, Yoga, Karan and Var
 koun sa din kitna shubh he or kitna ashubh, ye inhen paanch ango ke madhyam se janaa jaataa he
 Let's know about the importance of almanac and its five parts
 
 
 ye hai panchang ke paanch ang-1

 But a 28th constellation is also counted at the time of taking out the Muhurta
 use kehete he, abhijit nakshatra
 Constellations are seen while getting married, planetary entry, education, vehicle purchase etc
 2
 The second part of the date-almanac is the date
 tithiyaan 16 prakaar kii hoti hai
 Of these, Purnima and Amavasya are the two major dates
 ye donon tithiyaan maheene main ek baar jarur aati hai
 According to the Hindi calendar, the month is divided into two parts, Shukla Paksha and Krishna Paksha
 amavasya or poornima ke bich kii avadhi ko shukla paksh kaha jaataa he
 At the same time, the period between Purnima and Amavasya is called Krishna Paksha
 vaise aisi manyata he ki koi bhi bada yaa mahattavapurn kaam krishna paksh ke samay nahin karte
 This is said to be because at this time the powers of the moon weaken and darkness prevails
 to isliye sabhi shubh kaam jaise kii shaadi kaa nirnay shukla paksh ke samay kiya jaataa he
 3
 yoga-panchang kaa teesraa ang yoga he
 Yoga can have a profound effect on the life of any person
 panchang main 27 prakaar ke yoga maane gaye hai

 inamen chaar sthir hote hai or saat apni jagah badalte hai
 Bava, balava, oil, snake, commerce etc

 Amidst India's disappointment, there is a possibility that Home Minister p Chidambaram may raise the issue of acquittal of lashkar-e-taiba founder Hafiz Saeed by the Pakistani Supreme Court in a meeting with his Pakistani counterpart Rahman Malik during a visit to Pakistan next month

 Islamabad is not taking any action against Pak based terrorist organizations and allowing them to freely engage in anti-india activities

 Sex is an important part of married life
 lekin kai baar sex ke prati aruchi ke chalate sambandhon main tanaav paidaa ho jaataa he
 Nawabat reaches divorce
 aakhir sex ke peeche kii udaseenta kaa kya kaaran he? darasal, iske peeche bahut se shaareerik or manovaigyanik kaaran ho sakate hai
 But above all, the reason is that you do not understand your partner well
 apni jarurat or kamfort ke hisaab se naa sochen
 Take good care of your partner's will too
 yah baat stri or purush donon par lagu hoti he
 There is bound to be a difference in both choice and desire
 aise main ek-duusare ko samajhnaa behad jaruri he
 During sex, try to understand your partner's body language so that sex does not burden you or your partner, but after that you can get closer to each other in an emotional way
 " "sex life ko dilachasp banane kaa koi niyam nahin he balki bed rum main bitaye gaye kshanon ko sukhad banane ke apane pehle milan kii yaad ko taaja karen
 Recall how you were feeling when you first met your partner
 ise yaad karnaa bhi ek romaanchak anubhav hoga or aap apane aap ko tarotaaja mahasoos karenge
 To help you, here are some tips which will help you in understanding your partner
 kya chaahate hai purush:1
 Many women may not believe it, but it is true that some men are die-hard romantics
 isaliye romance ke saath sex kii shuruyaat karen
 Drink champagne under a blanket while watching the stars in the backyard of your house
 2
 Men like women who are bold and fearless during sex
 mahila ko chahie ki wo sex se pehle dark mek-ap kare
 Women should be fully prepared for sex by removing their fear and hesitation
 aisa karne se aapke saathi jindagi bhar aapke abhaari rahenge
 3
 routine life ko dilachasp banane kii jimmaa ab sirf pati par nahin daalaa ja saktaa, striyaan apni kaamuktha ke prati jaagruk ho rahi hai
 Even during sexual intercourse, he is no longer a passive role, now he is an equal participant in it
 aap nahin jhijake or ise sweekaaren tabhi aap apane life kaa bharpoor anand uthaa sakate hai
 "" 4
 aksar bed room main ghuste hi mahilaayein ghar, parivaar or rojaanaa kii gharelu baaten lekar baith jaati hai, jo purushon ko bilkul pansad nahin
 In such a situation, women should keep away from home, family and work in the bed room
 aap pyaar kii baaten karen or forple ke dauraan ek duusare ko mahasoos karen
 This will keep his trembling in you for a long time
 itnaa hi nahin yah sab aapaki vyast dincharya se aapke man-mastishk ko baahar nikaal degaa or aapako zyada fresh or zyada urja se bharaa hua bana degaa
 5
 aap apane pyaar ko barkaraar rakhana chaahati hai or apni kaamuk jindagi ko dilachasp bananaa chaahati hai to pehle aap khud ko or apane saathi ko khush rakhana seekhen
 You will not be able to enjoy it in moments of stress
 kya chaahati hai mahilaayein:1
 Women tend to like a slow start
 pehle mahila ke hothon ko dhime se chhuen or uske baad dhire-dhire unke upree or nichle hothon ko kis karen
 This love booster means that she will be happy with love tonic and will demand more from you
 2
 Slowly unwrapping your partner's clothes and then realizing having sexual intercourse with him is lovely
 aap bhi is pal kaa jeene kii koshish karen
 With this you will experience both adventures
 is kaam main apane saathi ko jaldbaaji na karne den
 3
 mahilaon main sar se lekar paanv tak saare ang kaamuk hote hai
 If you know how to touch it properly, then every part of his body can make you feel blissful
 " "4
 You should give each other time to get excited
 apni preyasi se kahiye kii wo nae tarah ke antarvastr pahane
 This is a small thing, but it is very important to take care of it to create thrill
 5
 a woman loves to kiss and love
 uske sharir ko sehlayein, kis karen, gaalon par, gardan par, hothon par lekin ek baat dhyaan main rakhen ki in baton main koi jaldbaaji naa karen
 It can be gritty fun

 ' Rahul Gandhi's appointment as Congress President was decided on Monday
 sirf rahul ne hi namakan bharaa he isliye unke nirvirodh congress adhyaksh chune jane kaa aupchaarik elaan hona hi baaki rah gaya he
 As president, he will take over the reins of the party from his mother Sonia Gandhi, who held this responsibility for 19 years
 haal philhal ke varshon main congress adhyaksh pad ke liye isi tarah nirvirodh tajposhi hoti rahi he
 But there have been many occasions in the history of Congress when there was a fierce battle within the party for the chair of the president
 isamen sabase mashhoor kissa he zebrahul gandhike pita rajeev gandhi ke naanaa or desh ke pehle pradhanmantri jawahar lalanehruke tamaam virodh ke baavjood purushottam das tandon congress ke adhyaksh banane main kaamyaab rahe the
 It was in August 1950 when the Congress President was to be elected
 mukaable main aamane saamne the acharya kriplani ke naam se mashhoor jivatraam bhagavaandas kriplani auranehruke hi shahar elahabaad se aane vaale purushottam das tandon
 Nehru and Tandon may have come from one city but there were tremendous differences between the two on ideology
 nehru kaa maananaa tha ki tandon ek ruudhivaadi hindu vichaardhaara ke vyakti hai or unka party adhyaksh bananaa desh or party ke hit main nahin hoga
 Earlier, there was a dispute between Tandon and Nehru about making Hindi the national language
 tandon hindi ke dhur samarthak the or use samooche desh kii bhashaa banane ke peeche puri takat laga rahe the
 But Nehru with a liberal nature believed that it would not be appropriate to impose Hindi on non-hindi speaking states
 yahi nahin pakistan ke khilaaf bhi tandon ke vichaar behad aakraamak the or unhone ek baar sharnaarthiyon kii ek sabha main pakistan se badla lene kii bhi baat kii thi jonehruko nagavar gujri thi
 Nehru believed that such thoughts would further inflame the spirit of the people
 us samay congress ke sabase kaddavar netaneharuki marji ke khilaaf agar purushottam das tandon maidan main utre the to uski vajah ye thi ki unke peeche sardaar patel (vallabh bhai patel) chattan kii tarah khadey the
 Sardar Patel wanted Tandon to be the president of the party under any circumstances
 patel or nehru kaa is chunaav ke kuch hi maheene pehle ek or behad ahm mudde par baari vivaad ho chukaa tha
 That was the case of being elected the first President of India
 nehruchaahte the ki si rajagopalchaari, jinhen rajaji ke naam se janaa jaataa tha, wo pehle raashtrapati bane
 But Patel's choice was Rajendra Prasad
 jab nehru ke nahin chaahane ke baavjood patel ke prabhaav kii vajah se rajendra prasad raashtrapati banane main kaamyaab hue toneharuko bada jhatka laga
 Therefore, the election of the President of Congress in 1950 became a nose question for him
 lekin jab chunaav hue to ek baar phir patel,nehrupar baari padey
 Tandon was easily elected Congress President by easily defeating Acharya Kripalani
 nehruis par kaaphi aahat hue
 He wrote in letter to C
 Rajagopalachari expressing his pain, 'tandon's election clearly shows that now neither the party needs me nor the government
 main behad thakaa hua mahasoos kar rahaa hum or mujhe aisa lagata he ab aage shaayad hi main santoshjanak dhang se koi kaam kar paaunga ''lekin tandon ke adhyaksh chune jane ke chaar maheene baad, 15 disambar 1950 ko sardaar patel kaa nidhan ho gaya
 After this, Tandon's path became very difficult
 nehru ke saath unke matbhed badhate gaye
 The gap between the government and the party widened so much that Nehru resigned from the Congress Working Committee to pressurize it
 maamle ko tool pakadta dekhakar ant main tandon ko jhukna pada
 Tandon resigned from the post of President on 10 September 1951 and was replaced by Jawaharlal Nehru as the Prime Minister as well as the President of the party
 agle chaar varsh tak nehru, party adhyaksh or pradhanmantri donon padon par bane rahe
 Pakistan and Iran signed Sovereign Guarantee Agreement 7 within next four years
 5 arab america dollar kii laagat vaali gas pipeline pariyojna ko puraa karne kaa rasta saaf kar diya
 a 900-kilometer long pipeline between Asaluyeh in southern Iran and Iran Shahr near the Pakistan border will supply natural gas from Iran's southern Persia
 pakistan ke petroleum mantri saiyad navid qamar ne islamabad main is samjhaute par hastakshar hone ke baad samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki mul rup se yah pipeline iran, pakistan or bharat ke bich bichhaayi jaani thi lekin baad main pichley varsh isamen badlaav kar diya gaya
