 In the Indian Premier League (IPL) players' auction, no franchise showed interest in bidding for former India captain Sourav Ganguly in the second round on the second day on Sunday as well, which meant that he would take the field in the fourth season of IPL
 But will not be seen playing
 ganguli ke alaava kris gail, bryan lara, sanath jayasoorya ko bhi kharidaar nahin mila
 However, Mohammad Kaif was lucky in this case, after being ignored twice, he was bought by Royal Challengers Bangalore with a bid of one lakh 30 thousand dollars
 ravivaar kii boli kii surkhiyaan ganguli ne batorin
 Throughout the day, speculation floated in the air that one of the franchises could buy Ganguly for the second time auction
 lekin frenchygiyon ke aagrah par jin 28 khilaadiyon kaa naam phir se nilaamee ke liye bolaa gaya usamen ganguli shaamil nahin the
 In the second auction, Murali Karthik was bought by Sahara Pune Warriors with a bid of four lakh dollars
 bharat ke sabase safal captain ganguli ke liye yah sharmindagi kii baat he kyonki unhone keval ipel main khilne ke liye apana cricket kariyar jari rakhaa he
 However, one of the reasons for not bidding on Ganguly could be his base price ($ 4 million) because by the time the name was called for the second time in the auction, it was clear that his old team KKR would not bid for him because he had only one and a quarter
 There were four million dollars left
 frenchiziyaan ab apni bachi raashi gharelu khilaadiyon par kharch karne kii taiyaari main hai

 kareeb 20 saal baad mohsin hamid ke pehle upanyaas moth smoke ne bharat, pakistan or saahitiyik jagat main jabardast halchal machaa di
 It did not receive either Booker or Pulitzer but was nominated for some prestigious awards
 is upanyaas kii taazgi or kasaavat par thos pratikriyaayein dekhne ko milin
 Mohsin says, "people in Pakistan are saying that by far the most important book for them is Moth Smoke
" main to kahuunga ki bharat main bhi aisa hi he
 "this is a matter of marque
 moth smoke lahore ke banker kii kahani he jo baad main ayyash ban jaataa he
 The Pakistan-born Mohsin is one of the most thoughtful and engaging voices in this book, along with Islam, globalization, and Samuel Huntington's "flash of Civilizations"
 inhen vajahon se unki kitaaben to zyada ahm ho gai hai lekin unamem dakshin asian tatv kii kami he
 His book Exit West, written before the emergence of Breguit and Donald Trump, was published in March, but does not mention Pakistan even once, where he has been living since 2009 with his wife and daughter

 "inke is sankoch ke baavjood unke sabhi upanyaas yaa to musalamaanon, dakshin asian logon yaa jinhen ''global southy kaa bashinda kehete hai, unke sangharsh par kendrit hai
 The form in which they place these issues before the readers of the West may say that they are slightly different from the works of Jhumpa Lahiri or Salman Rushdie
 mohsin ke upanyaas ek paramparaagat manyata ke virodh main likhe jate haih ve vishisht america sawaal ki ''ve hamase nafrat kyon karte hai?" yaa phir vaishvikaran main aarthik vruddhi kii sanak athwa kisi pravasi ko doum darje kaa samajhane kii dharna aadi kii aawaaj liye hote hai
 Mohsin actually addresses these weighing questions both directly and indirectly: he puts forward a clear agenda and consciously reduces it
 is kram main ve apane kirdaaron ko mahaj kathputli yaa mohare banane se batch jate hai
 From Moth Smoke's hedonism to How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia's introspective statements and the head of an identity crisis-ridden Exit West, all his books are "weird", in Mohsin's own words
 ek baat dhyaan dene vaali he
 They believe that all these narratives are love stories
 agsit west main achaanak aise portal khul jate hai jinaki madad se pravasi sharnaarthi kaaphi sahajata se damishq yaa lagos se landan yaa neuyork ja pate hai
 He says one thing about this, "I think it is very important for us to imagine a new future, especially in this pessimistic phase when nostalgia has become so important in our politics

 Chinese and Indian forces stood eye to eye, in a place that is possibly the world's most volatile corner
 yah us vakt shuru hua, jab chiniyon ne us ilaake main ek sadak banani shuru kii, jis par china or bhutan donon daawa karte hai
 Eventually both sides decided to retreat from the disputed plateau
 par kya yah china ke liye shaayad hi seemaa kaa masalaa tha
 But this conflict tells us how different the attitude of China and India is in terms of treaties and obligations according to international law
 china jawaharlal nehru se 1959 main tasadeeq kiye gaye 1890 ke sikkim seemaa samjhaute kaa hawala detaa he, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki yah sikkim or tibet ke bich seemaa ko tay karata he or baad main 1895 main simakan bhi hua tha
 Thus there is no dispute about the border of Sikkim and Tibet region
 yah taarkik lagata he par chiniyon ne is baat kaa ullekh nahin kiya ki nehru ne agali pankti main kya kaha tha—yah keval uttar sikkim ke bare main he, na ki us trikon ke bare main jis par bhutan or sikkim ko charchaa kerani he or jo aaj ek vivaadaaspad kshetra ban gaya he
 On October 28, the Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post published an article by Peter neville-headley, titled "why is China's record of sweet honor, bitter gossip?" In terms of honoring historical agreements? Headley referred to Doklam in this case
 or ascharyajanak rup se chini videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa lu kong ke bayaan kaa hawala diya jisamen unhone 1984 kii china-british ghoshnaa ko aisa aitihaasik dastavej bataaya he, ''jiskaa koi vyaavhaarik matlab nahin he
 
 
 There is also no binding force in how China is to administer Hong Kong
 ''is samjhaute ke tahat honkong ko 1997 main chini shashan ke tahat saunp diya gaya, lekin use agle 50 saal tak swaitshasi sarkaar or aantarik aazaadee banaae rakhane kii ijaajat di gai
 Now China is saying that this agreement is invalid and China can do whatever they like in Hong Kong
 nishchit rup se tibetiyon ko china ke saath kiya gaya aisa hi ek samjhauta yaad hoga, jis par unki sarkaar ne 1951 main dastakhat kiya tha
 It said that "the Tibetan people should return to the family of the motherland of the People's Republic of China
" 
 
 kendriya satta tibet ke maujuuda raajnneetik vyavastha se koi chhedchhad nahin karegi
 "as soon as this agreement was signed, the Chinese army annexed Tibet, crushed the revolt against its rule in 1959 and the Dalai Lama had to take refuge in India after that
" masalaa yah nahin he ki china khud dastakhat karne vaale kisi bhi sandhi yaa samjhaute kaa sammaan nahin karata, vah sirf un binduon kaa sammaan karata he, jiskaa vah sammaan karnaa chahta he, baaki ko kooday main daal detaa he
 The old agreements that China does not like are described as 'unequal compromises' and hence there is no reason to respect them accordingly
 haal ke kai antarrashtriya nirnay jo ki china ke anukool nahin rahe, use usne ''china ke antarrashtriya maamalon main dakhal' bataa diya
 Therefore, it does not matter what Nehru said in 1959 about the border dispute between Sikkim and Tibet
 phir yah jhamela kyon? shaayad china ke liye baat sirf seemaa yaa kisi sadak kii nahin he
 It is becoming clear that this was a political move of China, an attempt to create a gap between India and Bhutan
 china ne kabhi yah daawa nahin kiya tha ki 'shatabdiyon se' apane kathith kabje vaale is ilaake main vah sadak banayega
 The truth is that the sensitive construction came at a time when China was trying to raise penga from neighboring country Bhutan, the only neighboring country with which China has not yet established diplomatic relations
 himalay kaa yah rajshahi vaala desh bhutan 1910 main british aupniveshik shashan or 1949 tathaa 2007 main aaazaad bharat ke saath hue samjhauton ke jariye bharat se judaa hua he
 Bhutan was given a high degree of internal autonomy through the first two agreements, but India's guidance in its foreign relations continued, making it in some way a protected country of India
 2007 ke samjhaute se bhutan ko videshi maamalon main zyada aazaadee di gai
 In an effort to reduce India's influence in Bhutan, China adopted its traditional 'soft diplomacy' policy
 haal main china ke sarkas kalakaaron, naton or footbal khiladinnon ne bhutan kii yatra kii or kai bhutani chaatro ko china main padhgaye ke liye scolership di gai
 Tourism was also expanded
 ek dashak pehle tak haal yah tha ki sirf 19 chini paryatakon ne bhutan kii yatra kii thi, lekin aaj haalat yah he ki bhutan main har saal 9,000 chini paryatak jate hai, yah un deshon se aane vaale kul paryatakon kaa kareeb 19 fisadi he, jinke liye vija kii jarurat hoti he
 However, there is no Chinese Embassy in Thimphu nor Bhutan in Beijing, but bilateral relations between the two countries are being maintained through ongoing 'border negotiations'
 seemaa par chini dakhal se bharat hastkshep karne ko majaboor hua, jiskaa shaayad bhutaniyon ne puri tarah se swaagat nahin kiya, kyonki ve baaki duniya ko dikhaanaa chaahate hai ki ve ek aaazaad desh hai
 China did not delay in cashing it
 2 agast ko beijing main videsh mantralay ne ek bayaan jari kiya ki, ''china-bhutan seemaa kaa masalaa china or bhutan ke bich kaa he
 It has nothing to do with India
 bhutan kii taraf se bharat ko kshetreey maang rakhane kaa koi adhikaar nahin
 "the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that India has not only violated" Chinese sovereignty, but has challenged Bhutan's sovereignty and independence
 ''is prakaar puraane samjhaute or overlap karne vaale kshetreey daawey kaa card china us vakt kheltaa he, jab use bhu-samrik sthiti main badlaav karne kii jarurat hoti he, or is jaal main funskar inaki vyakhya main maathapai karnaa ek tarah kii bhul hi sabit hogi
 The so-called border dispute between India and China also has to be viewed in this light
 china kaa purana stand yah rahaa he ki—jisamen usne haal ke varshon main kai baar badlaav kiya he—vaastavik niyantran rekha ko seemaa maan liya jaae
 China has Aksai Chin and India has Arunachal
 china main is tarah ke saude kaa koi bhi virodh nahin karegaa, kyonki koi kar bhi nahin saktaa
 But India is a democracy where leaders have to come back again
 kisi bhi raajnneetijna ke liye aise saude par sahmati dena raajnneetik rup se aatmahatya karne jaisaa hi hoga
 The Chinese are undoubtedly aware of this and keeping the border issue alive serves a more important purpose for them
 china bhuulaa nahin he ki bharat ne dalai lamas ko sharan di he
 It is in China's interest to maintain some tension, because like other countries it does not want to solve problems
 vah to aisi samrik sthirataa chahta he jisko apane phaayde ke liye istemaal kiya ja sake
 Given the huge bilateral trade between India and China, there is no possibility of war like 1962
 lekin ansulajhe seemaa masale kaa china jab chaahe istemaal kar saktaa he, jaisaa ki usne bhutan main apana prabhaav jamaane ke liye kiya he
 Or India may show its displeasure at China's refusal to participate in China's multi-trillion dollar belt and road infrastructure development program
 china ke aarthik vistaar main raajnneetik saaya or kabhi-kabhi sainya maujuudagi bhi hoti he
 China's submarines are now regularly sighted in the ocean, where no Chinese naval ship was seen after that incident, when Zheng He, along with his fleet of Southeast and South Asia, Arabian Peninsula and East Africa It was a matter of the 15th century
 aisa kahana thodaa jatil lagata he ki himalay main sthit simavarti pathaar main vivaad kaa bane rahanaa china kii in dikhaawati yojanaon ke liye mufeed baat he
 But the truth is that the issue has never been a limit for him
 so, 2018 main vaisaa yuddh bilkul na hoga jaisaa ki 1962 main hua
 Similarly, China is in no hurry to settle its border dispute
 china ke paas videshi sambandhon ko manage karne kaa apana tarika he-jisamen kisi sthapit pattern yaa antarrashtriya rup se sweekaarya norm kaa istemaal nahin kiya jaataa

 samay ke saath mata-pita bhi badale hai
 Their thinking has also changed and now they are adopting their children's thinking and their choices too
 jabaki kuch saalon pehle tak unhen ye sunanaa bhi acha nahin lagata tha ki unki beti yaa bete ne kisi ko apane liye chunaa he
 If your parents can change this much for you, then it becomes your duty to include them in your every decision
 aap unhen apni baat samajhane kii koshish karen ki kyon wo ladkaa yaa wo ladki aapke liye sahi he or yakeen maniye wo aapaki baat jarur samajhegen
 Although it is difficult to tell mom and dad about the boyfriend, but it is better to tell the truth than hide something
 ab agar aapane ghar main bwoyfriend ke bare main bataa hi diya he aurause apane papa se milwane le ja rahi hanto kuch baton ke liye pehle se hi taiyaar ho jaaie
 You may also face situations during which most girls go through: 1
 aapke papa or bwoyfriend aamane-saamne baithe hai lekin donon main se koi kuch bol hi nahin rahaa
 Both are just smiling
 2
 You have never seen such a flat face of father
 3
 Negotiations between the two begin, so you have to take initiative but by creating balance
 ho saktaa he donon main se kisi ek ko ye lag jaae ki aap us par dhyaan nahin de raheen
 4
 aapke papa kaa pehla sawaal future ke bare main kya sochaa he? jabaki aapane abhi to sirf shaadi karne kaa hi soch rakhaa he
 5
 ho saktaa he aapke papa ko aapaki pasand acchhee lag jaae or wo puch baithen kishaadi kab karnaa chaahate ho?6
 When did you two meet? How to meet? Your father would definitely like to know this

 bharat main 14 november ko khaas taur par skulon main tarah-tarah kii mjedaar gatividhiyaan, fansy dress compatishan or melon kaa aayojan hota he
 Children's Day is a national festival of India dedicated to children

 The Madras High Court on Thursday allowed Tamil Nadu and the central government to put up banners to welcome the two leaders for an informal meeting to be held in Chennai next week between PM Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Chinfing
 adaalat ne kaha ki donon ganmaanya vyaktiyon ke swaagat main binar lagaaye jane par use koi aapatti nahin he
 The court had earlier banned the banning of roadside banners after the death of a female engineer and pulled up the government for not effectively implementing its orders
 nyaayamurti em satyanarayanan or nyaayamurti en seshasi kii khandpeeth ne haalanki yah spasht kiya ki aise bannron ko lagane ke sandarbh main rajya ko maujuuda sabhi niyamon kaa paalan karnaa hoga

 However, on the petition filed by the Municipal Corporation Commissioner and officials, the court did not allow such structures to be set up in the entire state
 yachikakarta ne bataaya tha ki modi or chinafing paryaton shahar main dwipaksheeya vaarta karenge
 The petitioner stated that it was the tradition of the Ministry of External Affairs to put up a banner to welcome visiting dignitaries

 Makkal Nidhi Mayam founder Kamal Haasan, while reacting to the government's move on Wednesday, criticized the move related to requesting approval from the court to place banners to welcome Modi and Xi Chinfing

 According to Malviya, PM Modi also follows Rahul Gandhi, who is accused of loot and fraud

 Let's know how you should pack your luggage while traveling and why
 
 
 1
 First of all, open the suitcase completely on the ground
 2
 Put the socks inside the shoes
 iske baad juuton ko suutakes main sabase pehle rakh den
 This will not lose your socks and won't spoil the shoes either
 3
 Fold thick clothes like jeans, sweaters over the shoes and press them downwards
 isse aapke suutakes main zyada jagah banegi
 4
 agar aapke paas kuch aisa saamaan he jo aasaani se tut saktaa he, to usko suutakes ke bich-bich fold kiye hue kapadon par rakh den
 By doing this your luggage will be safe
 5
 After this, fold the light clothes like T-shirt, Sakarf and keep it
 6
 It is better to keep the clothes folded in a plastic bag
 isse kapadon kaa rang duusare kapadon par nahin aayega saath hi kapadon par silawatein bhi nahin padengi
 7
 belt, roomaal or jaruri chote saamaan ko bachi hui jagah par rakhen

 " Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has targeted CM Yogi Adityanath over electricity in the state
 akhilesh ne twit kar kaha ki jitani bijli pehle se hi mil rahi he, utane kii hi ghoshnaa phir se karnaa nirarthak he
 It has supplied more than the public, not the status quo
 darasal, ab yogi sarkaar rajya main 24 ghante bijli dene ke liye puri jaan laga rahi he
 In a meeting with the officials, Yogi has decided that from the coming 14th April, 24-hour power will be made available in all district headquarters
 to vahiin tehsil or gaanv main bhi 18 ghante bijli di jaaegi
 In view of this, there will also be a meeting in Union Energy Minister Piyush Goyal and UP Minister Shrikant Sharma, in which by 2018 electricity and pilgrimage sites will be provided 24 hours electricity
 akhilesh yadav ne isi par tanj kasate hue kaha he ki itanibijlito pehle se mil rahi he
 It is meaningless to declare this

 It is useless to announce the same amount of electricity already available

 'BSP cash party' Akhilesh also attacked BSP and Mayawati fiercely and said - BSP is a party with cash, they are our aunt, nothing happens without cash in them, to be able to handle them

 We will ask the great hero of the century to stop promoting the donkeys of Gujarat

 ravivaar ko fatehpur main apni raily mempradhanmantri narendra modine sapa-congress gathbandhan par nishaanaa sadhate hue poocha tha ki kya yah gayatri prasad prajapati jaisaa hi pavitra he? Smartphone companies are doing many experiments in display
 karvd disple, scrtch pruf disple, shatter pruf disple or foldable disple
 These are some of the screen types, which are slowly starting to be found in smartphones

 This patent has also got the green signal
 is patent main mobile terminal kii baat kii gai he jise ek taraf se stretch kiya ja saktaa he
 However it is of expert level and at the moment it cannot be said that the company will launch it
 agar patent ke mutabik divaais taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he, to ham ye kah sakate hai ki company aisi screen ke saath smartphone laa sakati he jise yugers jarurat padane par khinch kar thodaa bada yaa chota kar sakate hai
 According to the report, LG has also said that such a display has a sensor with grip sensing unit and it will understand the behavior of the users
 udhaaharan ke taur par agar yujar video dekhne ke samay ek khaas jagah kii screen ko khinchataa he to baad main khud se vahaan video dekhte vakt screen expand ho jaaegi
 Significantly, during the Mobile World Congress, LG showcased a smartphone with two screens attached
 disple foldable nahin he, lekin ise foldable phone kaha ja saktaa he
 The special thing is that both the displays can be used side by side and this phone also has 5G connectivity

 After this decision of the government, the issue of problems being faced by farmers and small traders was also raised

 lekin hamen bolne nahin diya gaya
 At the same time, after meeting the JDU MP President, Sharad Yadav said that the condition of small shopkeepers, traders and farmers is getting worse

 On Congress demonetisation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the united opposition's clash over demonetisation was shattered
 darasal, congress party ke pratinidhimandal kii piem se mulaakaat ko lekar vipaksh main shaamil kai partiyaan naaraaz ho gayi
 Let me tell you that after the Congress met the PM regarding the problems of the farmers, the RJD, BSP, Samajwadi Party and NCP refused to meet the President with the Congress
 modi sarkaar kaa notebandi faisla desh ke adhikansh vipakshi dalon ko nagavar gujara he
 In view of this, the leaders of 16 political parties of the country including Congress were to meet President Pranab Mukherjee on Friday
 sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main notebandi ke mudde par vipaksh sarkaar ko gherne main juty rahi
 Two states of the country's politics about which it is said that the politics and direction of the country are determined by the politics here
 is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main in do rajyon main bijepi or vipaksh kii sabase badi pariksha thi
 Just before the election, when two opposing parties SP and BSP came together in UP, it was said from the same time that this time the BJP will stay away from absolute majority
 upi hi nahin bihar main bhi endie ke liye yahi baat kahi ja rahi thi kyonki argedy, congress, endie ke purv saathi araspi sab saath aae lekin nateeja sabake saamne he
 From the results that are coming out today, one thing has been decided that the BJP and Prime Minister Modi have destroyed all the equations
 itnaa hi nahin hameshaa ke liye in do rajyon kii raajnneeti bhi pradhanmantri narendra modi ne badal di to galat nahin hoga
 maya-akhilesh could not do it together, in Kamalupa politics, there is a lot of emphasis on caste mathematics
 yahi wo ganit he jiske baad yah kaha jane laga ki sapa or basapa saath aa gaye hai to ab kai siton par aise hi bijepi kaa patta saaf ho jayega
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the votes cast by these two parties began to be added
 kaha jane laga ki bijepi ko bahut adhik nuksaan hone ja rahaa he
 The loss of BJP began to be calculated by adding the votes of SP-BSP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 yah kaha ja rahaa tha ki sapa-basapa kaa mul votbank yadav, muslim or jatav ek saath sirf yahi teenon mil jaaen to aankada pahunchakar 43 fisadi hota he
 Not only this, muslim-yadav-dalit population is more than 60 percent in up's 10 seats
 jisamen ghosi, dumriyaganj, firozabad, jonpur, ambedkar nagar, bhadohi, bijanour, mohanlalganj, sitapur shaamil he
 muslim-yadav-dalit population in the 37 seats is between 50-60 percent
 Lok Sabha Election Results 2019 LIVE: dekhen pal-pal kaa apadetahaalanki jab nattejey saamne aa rahe hai to aisa lag rahaa he ki narendra modi ke aage saare sameekaran dhwast hote najar aa rahe hai
 Some seats of BJP are seen to be decreasing in UP as compared to 2014, but even the two parties, together, who were hoping to do damage to BJP in UP, did not succeed
 ab jabaki bijepi 56 siton par aage he to ek baat saaf taur par kahi ja sakati he ki modi ne aane vaale samay ke liye upi kii raajnneeti badal kar rakh di he
 Because this time two teams came together and could not do anything
 bihar main mahagathbandhan flopanateezon se pehle jab agsit pole saamne aayaa to bihar ko lekar jo anumaan lagaaya gaya to is par kisi ko yakeen nahin ho rahaa tha
 Do not know what the leaders of political parties said
 ab tak jo bihar ke rujhaan aa rahe hai usamen endie clin sweep karti najar aa rahi he
 No one may believe it or not, but something happened to Modi's charisma in Bihar that has stopped everyone speaking
 saare jaateey sameekaran dhawast ho gaye hai
 The mahagathambadhan that landed in Bihar under the leadership of Tejashwi Yadav has completely failed
 argedy, congress, upendra kushvaha or jeethanram maanjhi kii party sahit mahagathbandhan ke baaki sahyogi dal sab milakar bhi endie ko maat dena to dur thodaa bahut bhi nuksaan nahin pahunchaa sake
 BJP is ahead in 36 seats in Bihar
 vipakshi dal lagaataar pradhanmantri modi par waar karte rahe lekin janata ne piem modi ke naam par bharosa jataayaa he

 This is Chedi Ram, an independent candidate from Jhanjharpur Lok Sabha constituency
 chhedi ram jhanjharpur loksabhaa seat se sabase garib ummidavaar hai
 Disguised by the promise of the leaders and insensitivity towards the poor, Chhedi Ram's position in the electoral fray is that he is forced to sit on the roadside and sew slippers and shoes before the election results are out
 chunaav prachaar or kshetra ke daure par kharch ke chalate in par hajaaron rupee kaa karj ho gaya he
 Chedi Ram says that the public must have voted for him and he will definitely win

 netaji subhash chandra bose ke parivaar ke 50 se adhik sadsy agle maheene pradhanmantri narendra modi se milakar bose se judi sari filein sawarjanik karne kii maang karenge
 Significantly, Netaji's mysterious disappearance has been a topic of discussion since independence almost 70 years ago
 piem ne man kii baat main kiya ullekhanetaji ke parivaar ke sadasyon ne bataaya ki ve centre sarkaar ke paas maujuud netaji se judi sari filon ko saarvajanik karne kii maang karenge
 They will also urge countries like Japan, Russia and China to release such files with which Netaji was in contact
 piem modi ne apane radio sambodhan ‘man kii baat’ ke dauraan raashtra ko bose parivaar se prastaavit mulaakaat ke bare main bataaya
 He said, 'more than 50 members of Subhash Babu's family are coming from different countries
 mujhe unka swaagat karne main khushi hogi
 Describing this as an important occasion for him, Modi said that Netaji's family members will probably come together for the first time at the Prime Minister's residence
 pradhanmantri ne kaha, ‘lekin mere liye isse badi khushi kii baat yah he ki pradhanmantri awaas main kisi bhi vyakti ne aisa mauka nahin paaya hoga jaisaa ki main aktubar main paa rahaa hum
 When the files were made public, the Prime Minister remained silent but the Prime Minister made no mention of the demands of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee including her family to make Netaji's files public
 maaloom ho ki pashchim bengal sarkaar ne shuukravaar ko aisi 64 filein saarvajanik kii thim
 Modi recalled meeting some of Netaji's family members in Kolkata in May, saying, "I had a chance to spend some time with him
" us din yah faisla kiya gaya ki subhash babu kaa parivaar pradhanmantri awaas kii yatra karegaa
 Last week, i was confirmed that more than 50 members of Subhash Babu's family would visit the Prime Minister's residence
 ’parivaar kii maang, netaji kii filein saarvajanik honis bich bose ke pote chandra bose ne kolkata main kaha ki unka parivaar modi se aagrah karegaa ki vah rus, japan, china, america, britain, singapore or malaysia jaise deshon ko unke paas maujuud netaji se judi sari filon ko saarvajanik karne ke liye kahen
 Chandra Bose said, 'netaji was in touch with people in all these countries
 un sab ne unase judi filein gopneey rakhi hai
 To get all the clues, we want them to be made public globally
 ’ netaji ke ek or pote abhijit re ne kaha, ‘haalanki, hamaara mukhya jor bharat sarkaar paas rakhi netaji se judi sari filon ko saarvajanik karne kaa he
 If our own files are not public then how can we ask other nations to do so
 ’parivaar ko andeshaa, gopneey dastavej nasht kar die gaye hongevaise chandra bose ko lagata he ki bose ke laapata hone ke rahasy ko sulajhaa sakane vaale kuch gopneey dastavej nasht kar die gaye honge
 He said, 'I am not convinced that after the disappearance of Netaji in 1945, the files with the Central Government will be able to disclose everything that happened to him
 ve filein pichhali sarkaron dwaara pehle hi nasht kar di gai hongi
 He said that even the Mukherjee Committee had concluded that the four files were destroyed when Indira Gandhi was the Prime Minister
 gauratlab he ki bose kii 1945 main taipei main ek vimaan durghatana main maut hone ke siddhant ko unke parivaar ke zyaadaatar sadsy pehle hi khaarij kar chuke hai
 In the history given to Netaji, there is a reasonable place, Chandra Bose said that the story of Netaji's departure to Russia lasted for some time but the files of the government of West Bengal show that this story has a new Chinese aspect
 or phir kuch kaa kahana he ki vah gumnami baba ke rup main bharat aae the
 We have no concrete evidence to prove these theories
 unhone bataaya ki netaji ke parivaar ko kal pradhanmantri karyaalay (PMO) se ek phone kol aayaa or unase mulaakaat ke liye ek agenda taiyaar karne ko kaha gaya
 'we will demand to set up a high-powered committee under the Prime Minister himself to release all the files that are with the Center
 ’ bose ne kaha ki parivaar pradhanmantri se yah sunishchit karne kaa anurodh karegaa ki netaji ko itihaas main unka vaazib sthaan mili
 He said, 'netaji has not been given any place in the NCERT books
 ham chaahate hai ki log swatantraaa sangharsh main unki or unki aaazaad hind fouj kii bhoomika ke bare me tathaa aaazaad hind sarkaar ke bare main jane jiskaa gathan unke netritv main kiya gaya tha

 Under this scheme launched in 2015, women are given LPG gas connections
 sarkaar kaa daawa he ki 8 karod se zyada conection die ja chuke hai
 However, now the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has raised questions about this scheme
 kaig kii report ke mutabik ujjwala yojana kaa vyapak durupyog ho rahaa he
 The report says that instead of the needy, the benefit of this scheme is being given to those who do not have a need
 iske saath hi kaig ne is yojana main kai kamiyon ko bhi ujagar kiya he
 People not getting refills replenished! The CAG has stated that encouraging continued use of LPG gas is a major challenge as the annual average refill consumption of beneficiaries has declined
 beete saal report ke mutabik yojana ke tahat jin 1
 Connections were given to 93 crore consumers, 3 of them annually
 66 alpiji hi riffil karwaata he
 3 till 31 December
 18 karod ujjwala upabhoktaaon ke aadhaar par dekhen to sirf 3
 21 LPG are being refilled annually
 iskaa matlab ye hua ki logon ne alpiji silendar to le rakhaa he lekin usamen riffil nahin bharva paa rahe hai
 In the report of the beneficiary who is also taking a minor, it appears that 80 thousand connections have been allowed to be issued to people below 18 years due to software malfunctions
 isi tarah, 8
 59 lakh connections were issued to those beneficiaries who were minors as per Census 2011 data
 yah pradhanmantri ujjwala yojana guideline or alpiji control order 2000 kaa ulanghan he
 The report, which is being filled with 2 to 20 refills a day, states that 13 are covered under the scheme
 96 lakh upabhokta ek maheene main 3 se 41 tak alpiji silendar riffil kara rahe hai
 According to figures of Indane and HPCL 3
 44 lakh aise upabhoktaaon kaa maamla bhi saamne aayaa he jahaan par ek din main 2 se 20 alpiji silendar riffil bharwaaye ja rahe hai, jabaki inkaa conection ek silendar vaala he
 The report claimed that a large number of domestic cylinders are being used commercially
 iske mutabik 1
 98 lakh consumers are refilling more than 12 cylinders a year and this is the subject of investigation
 purushon ko bhi mila phaydapradhanmantri ujjwala yojana ke tahat mahilaon ko alpiji conection jari kiya jaataa he
 But the CAG report says that 1 of the men due to lack of input verification checks in the Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) software
 88 lakh conection jari kiye gaye the
 The report states that the goal of releasing LPG connections has been achieved to a large extent
 report ke mutabik 31 march 2019 tak oil marketing companiyon ne 7
 19 crore connections were issued, which was about 90 percent of the target of 8 crore connections by March 2020

 natwar singh ne apni aatmakatha van life ij note inf main tel ke badale anaaj ghotaale main khud ko nirdosh bataaya he
 This scandal led to his political exile 10 years ago
 unka yah daawa bhale hi pratyaashit lag saktaa he, lekin purv videsh mantri ne apni puraani party par bhi ungali uthaai he
 They say that they were made scapegoats to save the Congress
 saddaam hossain ke tel ne natwar ke rajnatik jivan par daag laga diya
 The whole incident is like this: The United Nations launched the oil-for-food Program in 1996 to help ordinary Iraqis troubled by economic sanctions against Iraq after Saddam Hussein attacked Kuwait
 is kaarykram ke tahat sanyukt raashtra kii dekharekh main iraqi tel bechney ke badale main anaaj diya janaa tha
 This $ 60 billion plan soon led to allegations of irregularities that the Saddam government was manipulating the program for money and influence
 tab sanyukt raashtra mahasachiv kophi annan ne yues fedral rigerv ke purv chairman paul volkar se in aaropon kii jaanch karne ke liye kaha
 In Volcker's 2005 report, Natwar Singh, Bhim Singh of the Panthers Party and some corporate houses were named as "non-contractual beneficiaries"
 yah aarope lagaaya gaya ki natwar kii madad se unke bete jagat or uske dost andaleeb sahagal ko tel ke 40 lakh bairal mili, jo unhone gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se ek swiss company messfield agi ko bech die
 It was alleged that he took brokerage, which was named 'surcharge'
 mana jaataa he ki uskaa ek hissaa baghdad main saddaam hossain kii sarkaar ko pahunchaa diya gaya tha
 In an interview to India Today in 2005, Ambassador Anil Matharani in Croatia at the time said that during a visit to Baghdad in January 2001, Natwar Singh introduced his son and Sehgal to the people of the Iraqi government: "it is a matter of meeting
 During that transaction, the transaction was cleared
 ” is kram main rajnatik aarope yah tha ki badale main natwar singh ne saddaam kaa jamkar samarthan kiya
 Now Natwar Singh is trying to clean his case in this matter
 ve poochhate hai ki aakhir congress par sawaal kyon nahin uth rahaa, jiskaa naam volkar kii report main tha
 He says, "if you look at the paragraphs of the Volcker Report, it is known that in 1997, the Congress Party was mentioned
 meraa naam to march, 2005 main joda gaya
 As Madam Sonia said, i have to trap her
 ” (dekhen baatcheet)
 The Enforcement Directorate (ED) does not accept the claims made in the book as true
 idi ne videshi mudra vinimay prabandhan kanoon (epaieme) ke tahat isaki jaanch kii thi
 He says the evidence points to Singh and Sehgal's involvement
 yah maamla ab dilli main idi ke nyaayaadhikaran ke paas he
 In the ed's show cause notice, it was alleged that Natwar came to foreign money "jointly and several times"
 kul 898,027 dollar (5
 4 crores), which is a violation of FEMA
 natwar kehete hai ki volkar ke aaropon kii jaanch karne vaale nyaayamurti aar
 s
 pathak ne jaanch cameti kii report main unhen doshamukt kar diya tha
 This report was submitted to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 use ab tak saarvajanik nahin kiya gaya
 Significantly, Natwar in his book Justice R
 es
 There is a lot of contradiction in what the reader says and has been told
 natwar apni kitaab main likhte hai ki pathak ne “aupchaarik rup se apni report 7 agast, 2006 ko piem ko saunp di
 In his conclusion, he had exonerated the Congress party completely
 ” bakaul natwar singh, “mere bare main unhone kaha ki aisa koi bhi saboot nahin he, jisase pataa chale ki natwar singh ne thekon se koi aarthik yaa anya vyaktigat phayda uthaaya
 Despite this, the ED accused "my son and me
" ” ve likhte hai, “justise pathak ne ek baar mujhase kaha tha ki un par bahut zyada dabaav tha
 He also told me that he did not find evidence of any financial disturbances against me
 ” lekin mana jaataa he ki pathak samiti ne apane nishkarsh main likhaa tha ki “andaleeb sahagal or aditya khanna (ek enarai kaarobaari, jo natwar singh ke rishtedaar hai or jinhone kathith taur par messfield agi se paison ko bharat pahunchaaya tha) ko jo theke mili, ve purv videsh mantri ke
 This would not have been possible without Natwar Singh's intervention
 ”natwar singh ne apni kitaab main justise pathak ke saath apni baatcheet ke bare main jo kuch likhaa he, ab uski pushti nahin kii ja sakati, kyonki apni report saunpane ke ek saal baad 2007 main dil kaa daura padane se justise pathak kaa nidhan ho gaya tha
 Natwar alleges that the Justice Pathak inquiry committee constituted by the UPA government was prone to bias
 “on May 31, 2006, i was asked to appear before the Pathak inquiry committee
 paanch minute ke bheetar yah spasht ho gaya ki samiti purvaagrah se grast thi
 He was directed to absolve the Congress of all charges
 ”pathak samiti ne kaha tha ki sahagal or khanna ne kathith rup se tel ke do thekon se dallali ke taur par 1,46,000 dollar (88 lakh ru
 ) Were achieved
 us samay hamadaan expotres ke nideshak sahagal jagat ke bachapan ke dost hai
 The committee admitted that Sehgal got these contracts only because of Natwar Singh and misused the Congress name
 idi ke adhikariyon ne daawa kiya tha ki poochtacha ke dauraan sahagal ne natwar singh kaa likhaa ek patr iraqi adhikariyon ke paas le jane kii baat kabool kii thi, jisamen hamadaan expotres ko tel ke coupon dene kaa anurodh kiya gaya tha
 It was a coincidence that Jagat married Sehgal's sister Soumya two years after the Volcker report came out
 achraj kii baat he ki natwar sahagal se apane sambandhon or iraqi adhikariyon ke liye likhe apane khat ke bare main koi baat nahin karte
 Natwar writes that the previous UPA government did not want to give him information about the documents that special envoy Virender Dayal had obtained from the United Nations
 ye dastavej un bhartiya vyaktiyon ke bare main the, jinka naam volkar report main liya gaya tha
 The ED claims that Natwar never demanded any specific documents and the investigating agency could not provide all the documents
 natwar singh vishesh doot dayaal ke bharat laae dastavejon par purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke dhulmul ravaie ke bare main bhi likhte hai
 In May 2013, the RTI application filed on behalf of Arun Kumar Aggarwal, a Bangalore lawyer, was rejected by the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) in May 2013
 piemo kaa kahana tha ki uske paas dastavej to hai, lekin unhen saarvajanik nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 Earlier in 2006, the PMO told the then Chief Information Commissioner Wajahat Habibullah that it did not have any documents
 dayaal jo jaruri dastavej lekar aae the, unhen natwar singh ko nahin diya gaya tha
 Dayal says, "I don't know whether those documents were given to the Pathak Committee or not
 meraa kaam keval natwar yaa kisi anya se sambandhit dastavej laana nahin tha, balki volkar report main ullikhit sabhi dastavejon ko laana tha
 When asked about Natwar's claims of acquittal, Dayal says, "it is very difficult to say that he was involved in this scam
" yah bahut vyaktiparak maamla he or meri bhoomika kaaphi simit thi
 "that is, there will be more revelations in this matter
