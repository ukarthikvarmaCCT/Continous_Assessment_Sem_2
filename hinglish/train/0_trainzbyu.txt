 But i am not film kii samiksha ek peshewar kaam he
 The reviewer watches the films, wins them but the reviewers have been made cinema viewing guides
 saare darshakon ke badale koi ek sameekshak darshak kaise ban jaataa he
 But why this question arises only when no film is able to play
 tab kyon nahin uthta he jab chal jaati he
 The reviewer does not watch just one film
 wo ek film kii pehle kii kai filmon ke apane sansaarik anubhav se samiksha karata he
 Therefore, its existence cannot be dismissed because not every review is and should not be the same
 bombai ko lekar cinema or raajnneeti ne jo myth gadhe hai unhen pramanik itihaas kii dharaatal par laayaa janaa baaki he
 If i say that opium is suppressed at the root of Bombay, then to understand this one line, one has to return between many books written on the history of Bombay
 mumbai se pehle bombai kii yatra samaan avasaron or loktantric adhikaron kii yatra nahin he
 Its journey is the journey of a Nexus which has become complete today
 jo raajnneeti, media, real estate, police or cinema ke naam-anaam rishton main chhipi he
 The Narrative of the Battle of the Kabbah at Bombay is still on
 ye bombai shahar haadason kaa shahar he
 When it is dark, a thief comes out after midnight
 aise anek gane hai jo bombai ke bombai hone ke kaale sach ko safed karte rahete hai
 a history of Bombay is recorded in these films and songs
 anuraag kashyap ne ek behtareen film banaai he
 The story of 'bombay Velvet' is no longer Bombay
 greater noida, noida, gudgaanv na jane kahaan kahaan fail gai he
 The middle class buys only Sapna from real estate, but real estate is not the dream but the reality of the deal
 bombai ke mahanagar hone se pehle kii kahani he bombai velvet
 Balraj is killed by being trapped in the nexus of becoming its metropolis
 cricket control of india kii katha kya aaj bhi jari nahin he
 What was yesterday is still today
 main bombai velvet ko smart city ke shor main bhi dekhne laga
 Each frame of this film is memorable
 ranbir kapur kii adaakaari kii jitani taareef kii jaae wo kam hogi
 This is Ranbir's best film
 anoushka sharma kaa abhinay jitna pramanik laga he wo unke tazaa vivaadon ke kaaran charchaa kaa shikaar ho gaya
 The film sets, shades, designs, fabrics are all authentically made
 amitabh bhattacharya ke geet kamaal ke hai
 The film is neither slow nor lacks emotion
 is film main jo he uske liye dekha janaa chahie
 The viewer should also see new
 dekhakar kaarij karne ke liye sahi par ye wo film nahin he jise samiksha main mili ek star ko dekh chhod diya janaa chahie
 Similar reaction was seen during 'gangs of Wasseypur', which is a great film of our times
 suna he anuraag kashyap dukhi hai
 Going to paris purbia kab imotional hona chhodega samaj nahin aata lekin wo imotional nahin rahegaa to phir purbia bhi nahin rahegaa
 You can laugh while reading these lines, but Raj Saheb and Yash Ji were able to make films of their mind because they could never give up their Punjabi
 raaj kapur yaa yash chopra nahin main yash ji hi kahata hum tabhi lagata he ki maine unki shaan main kuch kaha he
 The comments anuraag kashyap, dibaakar banerjee, shoojit sarkaar apane dam par khadey hone vaale nirdeshak hai
 The difference between a director and a filmmaker made sense when i saw 'gangs of Wasseypur'
 jab 'paan singh tomars' dekhi thi, bhale wo anuraag kii film nahin thi
 Everyone writes a story, but not everyone is a writer
 kai logon ke liye safalataa ke kai maanakon par anuraag asafal nirdeshak ho sakate hai magar ek filmkaar ke rup main koi kaarij nahin kar saktaa
 That's why i watch all of Anurag's films
 kya fark padataa he ek nirdeshak mumbai chhod paris chalaa jaae
 Let it go paris main bhi use bombai velvet kii hi kahani milegi
 This is the history of metros
 mere likhe ko samiksha na samajhen or na hi padhane ke baad film na dekhne kaa apana iraadaa badalen
 If you do not watch a good film, nothing will happen
 ham bahut si acchhee filmein nahin dekhte hai
 By the way, while watching the film on Monday afternoon, the number of people in the hall was surprised
 mujhe to laga ki main hi akelaa dekh rahaa hounga
 Perhaps people are still watching movies without reading reviews
 jaise kisi film main achaanak koi seen saath ke dashak kaa ho jaataa he to kisi prasang main koi purana gaanaa baj uthta he
 Not just for the rise of Nostalgia, but to narrate the journey that continues to this day
 'bombai belwet' cinema main bombai or bombai ke cinema kaa cinema he
 Last Sunday, the film had come out to watch, but the effect changed due to the scattering reviews on Facebook and Twitter
 main cinema haul se laut aayaa
 i did not read any reviews because i do not watch cinema after reading reviews but the title felt that it was forbidden
 jab patna main filmein dekhnaa shuru kiya to haul ke baahar noticeboard ke bheetar lage passport saise photo dekhakar film ke seen kii kalpana karata tha or dekhtaa tha
 The discussions of the people who returned seeing the trailer, the poster and the film had more effect
 dilli aayaa tab tak kai log sameekshak ban gaye or hamaare dekhne na dekhne par inkaa asar aaj bhi jari he
 i too became a reviewer type writing on the blog
 par hum nahin
 The film review is a professional work
 sameekshak filmein dekhtaa he, unhen jeeta he lekin sameekshak cinema dekhne ke guide bana diye gaye hai
 How does one become a reviewer instead of the whole audience
 par yah sawaal tabhi kyon uthta he jab koi film nahin chal paati he
 Why does it not arise when it is gone? sameekshak sirf ek film nahin dekhtaa he
 He reviews a film from his worldly experience of many earlier films
 isliye uske hone ko kaarij bhi nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki har samiksha ek jaisi nahin hoti or na honi chahie
 The myths created by cinema and politics about Bombay are yet to be brought to the surface of authentic history
 agar main kahuun ki bombai kii jad main afim dabaa he to is ek pankti ko samajhane ke liye bombai ke itihaas par likhi anek kitabon ke bich lautnaa padegaa
 a visit to Bombay before Mumbai is not a visit to equal opportunities and democratic rights
 isaki yatra ek nexs kii yatra he jo aaj mukammal ho gai he
 Which is hidden in the name-anonymous relationships of politics, media, real estate, police and cinema
 bombai par qabze kii ladaai kaa nerrative aaj bhi chaalu he
 This city of Bombay is a city of accidents
 jab andhera hota he ek chor nikalataa he aadhi raat ke baad
 There are many songs that keep whitening the black truth of Bombay being Bombay
 bombai kaa ek itihaas in filmon or gaanon main darj he
 Anurag Kashyap has made a great film
 'bombai velvet' kii kahani ab bombai kii nahin rahi
 Greater Noida, Noida, Gurgaon Do not know where it has spread
 middle class real estate se sirf sapana karidata he par real estate sapane par nahin saude kii hakeekat par khadaa he
 Bombay Velvet is the story before Bombay became a metropolis
 iske mahanagar banane ke nexs main funs kar balraj maaraa jaataa he
 Is the legend of Cricket Control of India not continuing even today? jo kal tha wo aaj bhi he
 i also started seeing Bombay Velvet in the noise of Smart City
 is film kaa ek ek frem yaadgaar he
 The praise of Ranbir Kapoor's performance will be less
 ye ranbir kii sabase acchhee film he
 Anushka Sharma's acting is as authentic as it has become a topic of discussion due to her recent controversies
 film kaa set, shades, dizine, kapade sab pramanik tareeke se banaae gaye hai
 Amitabh Bhattacharya's lyrics are amazing
 yah film na to slo he or na isamen imoshan kii kami he
 For what is in this film must be seen
 darshak ko bhi nayaa dekhnaa chahie
 It is not the film that should be left out to a star found in the review, to dismiss it
 aisi hi pratikriya 'gangs of vasepur' ke vakt dekhi thi jo hamaare samay kii ek mahaan film he
 Heard that Anurag Kashyap is sad
 paris ja rahe hai
 i do not understand when Purbia will stop being emotional but if it is not emotional then Purbia will also not be there
 aap in panktiyon ko padhate hue hans sakate hai par raaj sahab or yash ji apane man kii filmein isiliye bana paae kyonki ve apane punjabipan ko kabhi nahin chhod paye
 Not Raj Kapoor or Yash Chopra, i only say Yash ji, only then it seems that i have said something in his pride
 tippaniyan Anurag Kashyap, Dibakar Banerjee, Shoojit Sarkar are directors on their own
 ek nirdeshak or filmkaar main tab fark samaj main aayaa jab 'gangs of vasepur' dekhi thi
 When i saw 'paan Singh Tomar', it was not Anurag's film
 kahani sab likhte hai par sahityakar sab nahin hote
 For many people, Anurag can be a failed director on many parameters of success, but one cannot dismiss him as a filmmaker
 isliye anuraag kii sari filmein dekhtaa hum
 What does it matter if a director leaves Mumbai and moves to Paris
 use jane dijiye
 In Paris too, he will get the story of Bombay Velvet
 mahanagaron kaa itihaas hi yahi he
 Do not consider my writing as a review nor change your intention of not watching the film after reading it
 aap ek acchhee film nahin dekhenge to kuch nahin hoga
 We do not watch many good films
 vaise somvaar dopaher jab yah film dekh rahaa tha tab haul main logon kii sankhya dekh hairaani hui
 i thought that i would be the only one watching
 shaayad ab bhi log samiksha padhe bina bhi filmein dekh rahe hai

 suna he anuraag kashyap dukhi hai
 Going to paris purbia kab imotional hona chhodega samaj nahin aata lekin wo imotional nahin rahegaa to phir purbia bhi nahin rahegaa
 You can laugh while reading these lines, but Raj Saheb and Yash Ji were able to make films of their mind because they could never give up their Punjabi
 raaj kapur yaa yash chopra nahin main yash ji hi kahata hum tabhi lagata he ki maine unki shaan main kuch kaha he
 The comments anuraag kashyap, dibaakar banerjee, shoojit sarkaar apane dam par khadey hone vaale nirdeshak hai
 The difference between a director and a filmmaker made sense when i saw 'gangs of Wasseypur'
 jab 'paan singh tomars' dekhi thi, bhale wo anuraag kii film nahin thi
 Everyone writes a story, but not everyone is a writer
 kai logon ke liye safalataa ke kai maanakon par anuraag asafal nirdeshak ho sakate hai magar ek filmkaar ke rup main koi kaarij nahin kar saktaa

 saath hi ummid jataai ja rahi he ki ab uttar korea apane parmaanu hathiyaaron or pareekshan sthalon ko nasht kar degaa
 However, it does not seem appropriate to believe North Korea so soon
 isaki vajah yah he ki uttar korea pehle bhi apane parmaanu kaarykram ko band karne ko lekar samjhauta kar chukaa he or phir tod chukaa he

 When it was reported to the US, the agreement was broken
 saal 1998 main uttar korea ne apni pehali lambii range kii missile kaa pareekshan kiya
 In 1999, Kim Jong-il announced to cease missile testing, after which the US relaxed the restrictions on it
 haalanki is baar bhiuttar koreupane vaade se mukar gaya or phir usne missile va parmaanu pareekshan kiye
 The nuclear deal that North Korea had signed earlier was done due to economic sanctions
 haalanki wo samjhaute kii sharton ko kabhi puraa nahin kiya
 At the same time, it secretly increased its nuclear capability and at one time it came to threaten the US for a nuclear attack

 com / fyvdlmaa3q After the terrorist attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan is completely surrounded
 pulavama hamale kaa jimmedaar pakistan kii sarazamiin par pal rahaa jaish-e-mohammad he, ise har koi jaanata he
 Since then, India has put pressure on Pakistan and tried to surround it worldwide, which is showing its effect
 pakistan ne jaish-e-mohammad, lashkar-e-taiyaba, jamaat-ud-daawa jaise sanghathanon par bain lagaaya he
 However, the nature of Pakistan is not visible in this because there have been many occasions in the last two decades when it has banned these organizations
 sawaal ek baar phir yahi he ki kya ye sirf dikhaave vaali karrwai he
 Action or just pretense? The wire of Pulwama terror attack is connected with Pakistan, this issue was proved by India on the international scene
 jiske baad se duniya ke kai deshon ne pakistan par aatanki sanghathanon par karrwai karne ko kaha, naa sirf desh balki sanyukt raashtra, FATF, UNSC kii taraf se bhi pakistan par dabaav tha
 That is why he immediately took action and banned 44 organizations and also detained some
 haalanki, pakistan kii is karrwai ko thos mana jaae aisa koi saboot nahin he
 Because many people of Pakistan are writing on social media that we have seen such ban-action before
 gauratlab he ki america main aatanki hamale, mumbai hamale ke baad bhi pakistan ne aise hi kai baar kuch aatanki sanghathanon par bain lagaaya tha
 Why is there no faith in Pakistan? Actually, the history of Pakistan is such that it cannot be trusted
 pakistan pehle hafiz said ke sanghathan par bain laga chukaa he lekin hafiz vahaan aam chunaav lard chukaa he rozaana reliyaan karata he or hindustan ke khilaaf zehar ugalta he
 Not only Hafiz, but Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has confessed in several TV interviews after the Pulwama terror attack that Maulana Masood Azhar, the leader of jaish-e-mohammed, is in Pakistan
 ek intervyuu main to vah jaish kaa bachaav karte hue kah rahe the ki pulavama kii jimmedaari jaish ne nahin lee he, ye sirf ek bhram he
 Why Pakistan had to take such action? Actually, there are many kinds of compulsions of Pakistan behind this action
 pehali to ye ki pulavama aatanki hamale ke baad bharat ne kootnithik taur par use duniyabar main aisa gheraa ki har bade desh ne uski aalochana kii
 Since then, he has been challenged to prove himself before the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)
 kyonki agar UNSC jaish jaise sanghathan par bain lagaataa he to pakistan ke liye karrwai karnaa jaruri hota or kai anya agenciyon kaa bhi dabaav usapar banataa
 This is the reason that Pakistan has taken such action before the UNSC marathon on 13 March
 jisapar vishwaas karnaa kaaphi mushkil he
 Who are included in the list? Among the organizations which Pakistan has banned, many black terrorists have black letters
 jisamen hafiz said kaa jamaat-ud-daawa, phala-e-insaaniyat foundation, moulana masood ajahar kaa jaish-e-mohammad, lashkar-e-taiyaba, al-kaayda, taharik-e-taliban shaamil hai
 These organizations are considered to be terrorists in India
 iske alaava bhi pakistan ne kai balooch or taliban samarthit sanghathanon par bain lagaaya he

 Still most people in India may not have heard the name of crypto currency and bitcoin, but you will be surprised to know that bitcoin is becoming increasingly popular in India and this is causing people to transact millions of crores of rupees every day
 bitcoin ek krypto karency yani digital mani he jisko bharat sarkaar ne manyata to nahin di he lekin tamaam log ise istemaal kar rahe hai kyonki isko lekar koi niyam kanoon nahin he
 Now mps have expressed concern that the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India have not recognized the currency
 vah mudra kaise teji se bad rahi he
 On Thursday, the matter came up loudly in the Parliament's Standing Committee on Finance and many mps raised the question that if Bitcoin is illegal then how is its ad appearing in a big English newspaper
 vitt maamalon kii sthai samiti main yah maamla buudhvaar ko bhi uthaa tha or is samiti ke sadasyon ne rigerv bank ke governor urjit patel se yah poocha tha ki bitcoin jaise krypto karency par lagaam lagane ke liye kya kadam uthaae ja rahe hai?bitcoinako bhale hi sarkaar ne manyata nahin di ho lekin ek anumaan ke mutabik 2015 main ek lakh se zyada vyapaariyon ne bitcoin ko sweekaar kiya
 The popularity of bitcoin can be gauged from the fact that not only can it buy things but it can be converted into any foreign currency like dollar, pound and euro

 daanpaty jivan or bhi zyada sukhmay or madhur ho, iske liye yah jaruri he ki kuch khaas baton kaa khyal rakhaa jaae
 Some small, but very useful things can easily convey sweetness in a relationship
 yahaan kuch tips die ja rahe hai, jisase vaivaahik jivan zyada aanandadaayak ban saktaa he
 1
 aam taur par purush sex sambandh banane main jaldbaaji karte hai
 It is not necessary that the woman is ready to have a physical relationship at all times
 aise main duusare kaa mood bhaanp lenaa bhi bahut jaruri ho jaataa he
 If either of them says 'no' to it, then it should be postponed for another time
 2
 It is often men who initiate physical relationships
 par kabhi-kabhaar mahilaon ko bhi isaki pahal kerani chahie
 This removes monotony and maintains thrill
 3
 Try to be happy in front of your partner while building a relationship
 kai baar khush dikhne kaa abhinay karnaa bhi sachmuch phydemand sabit hota he
 4
 aisa bhi dekha gaya he ki purush santushti ke baad apane partner kii parvaah kiye bina sidhe neend kii agosh main chale jate hai
 This is not right
 apane saath kaa khyal rakhana bahut jaruri he
 5
 bistar par un baton kaa zikr na karen, jise sunakar vyarth hi maansik tanaav hota ho
 Leave all the stress and make a rule to go to the bedroom
 6
 There should be no room for doubt in the relationship
 jab bhi apane partner main koi asaamaanya baat mahasoos ho, to ek-duusare se khulkar charchaa karen
 7
 daanpaty jivan sirf sex par hi tikaa nahin hota he
 Relations can be strengthened even more by giving each other true love

 Supporters of Hardik Patel created a furore at the meeting of BJP President Amit Shah in Surat
 patidaar samudaay ke ek sammaan samaaroh main pahunche amit shah ko hardik ke samarthakon ke virodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Seeing the opportunity, now through this incident, the Congress is now trying to surround Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah
 congress ne ise piem or bijepi kii girti lokapriyata se jodate hue rajya or centre main sarkaar kii thap nitiyon kaa hawala diya
 Addressing reporters in Delhi, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that this is not a simple protest but a mass movement related to agriculture
 singhvi ne kaha, 'ek prakaar se ye ek nai kranti he, ek andolan he, ek jabardast baghawat he
 Look at Gujarat and its causes, which is very serious
 unka vishleshan karnaa aavashyak he
 Singhvi gave details of Gujarat's agricultural failures one by one
 unhone kaha ki pichley 20 saalon main jahaan-jahaan bijepi kii sarkaar rahi he vahaan krishi kii haalat bahut buree he or vishesh rup seberolgaarake vikaas main ek speshligeshan bijepi ne bana liya he, bina rojgaar ke vikaas or vishesh rup se parilakshith hota he krishi ke vishay main
 He said that the Gujarat model has flopped
 berogari badhati ja rahi he
 Whose people are now starting to revolt against the government
 unhone kaha ki 2002-12 ke bichgujaratmen kareeb saadhe 5 hajaar se zyada krishakon kii mrityu hui he, ye sarkari aankade hai, jise chupaane kii koshish kii gai
 According to Singhvi, farmers in Gujarat are in a very miserable condition
 unhone kaha ki upie sarkaar ke dauraan 2013-14 main vikaas kii dar -0
 Was 2 percent
 2013-2014 tak growth thi sava 4 pratishat thi
 But the growth of agriculture in the NDA government at national level in 2014-2015

 aniruddh mahaleakhir mahaj samalangik rujhaan vaala purush apane yon anubhav ko kaise aankata he? istemaal kiye condom se? khaali pade bistaron se? aae yaa gaye aadamiyon se? dusron ko sunai gai mazaakia kahaniyon se yaa khud apane jatan se failaai afvaahon se? peeth peeche kii gai chugaliyon se yaa munh ke saamne kii gai tarifon se? salawaton se bhari apni chaadaron se yaa fatah kii choti-moti baton se? grinder ping yaa tinder ke katakshon se? isse yaa usase?lekin pehle dekhen ki kya hamaare paas itani gunjaaish he jisamen algebiticuye (lesbian, ge, bisexual, transgender, kkir, intersex, assexual+) samudaay yon anubhavon ko saajha kar saktaa he? bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 377 ke hisson ko radd karne or aakhirkaar do samalangik vayaskon ko aapasi rajamandi se prem karne kii ijaajat dene vaale supreme court ke aitihaasik faisle ko aae bhale hi ek saal ho gaya ho, par kya isse hamaari rosemara kii jindagi main vaaki koi fark aayaa he?haa, or nahin bhi
 First, let's look at the big picture
 is faisle ke baad puure ek maheene # lavijalav trend kar rahaa tha or clic ke jariye fansaane (samalangik samskruti se jude) kii taadaad uchhalkar oonche paaydaan par pahunch gai thi
 Hindustan was finally talking about openness and acceptance, about emotional conflicts and inclusiveness, about variety of relationships and sexuality and asking the right questions
 log vaaki jaananaa chaahate the
 But when it comes to our sex life, then there is a lot of silence
 desh ghabaraakar khisen niporne lagata he, ''isamen poochne vaali kya baat he
 
 
 What people do in bed is entirely their personal matter
 '' is vaakya kii vidambnaa par khulkar hansen, jisaki vajah se 377 ke pehle ke jamaane main iskaa jo matlab ho saktaa tha
 Yes, they also had questions
 magar kya ve sahi sawaal the? asal main, nahin
 He pressed his face and asked, "how do you do it?" The question that they do not care about is, 'how does it feel?' For a country that does not take pride in the creation of Kamasutra, we are not surprisingly progressive in talking about sex
 khaas taur par samalangik sex ke bare main
 Appearing in secluded, the average gay man is likeable, sociable and gentle, is polite and passionate and always knows what to say
 vah fishan or shaakaahaar ke bare main baat karata he or yah bhi ki gym main pair kii kasaraton ke baad uski glutis masampeshiyaan kaise dard karti hai
 At first sight the average gay man is the main character of Netflix Originals
 inhen band daravaajon ke peeche aap ek puri nai yon kranti ghatate hue dekhte hai
 The ignorant and the arrogant must know that gay men will always be associated with Grindr, Gay Bar and (occasionally) Golden Shower
 or chhichhore hameshaa 'shandaar' doston ko sibar spes, yaa usase bhi badtar, saarvajanik shauchalayon ke kone main khojane ke liye laanatein bhejte rahenge
 Like a lonely 30-year-old gay man who is as aware of himself as he loves himself, i have no hesitation about being on Grindr (or any other dating app)
 grinder (or joda milaane vaale ap ke kism-kism ke karmi) yon swatantraaa ke liye samalangik aadmi kaa sunaharaa tikat rahaa he
 If you listen to the myths, then you will assume in advance that every gay is an old-fashioned horny man in a very bad porn movie
 magar yahi to baat he
 Our sex life is like anyone's sex life
 aap jis bhi samalangik aadmi ko jaanate hon, usase puuchhen or vah aapako batayega ki yah sab ek sareekha hi he
 After all, we are equal
 sachaai yah he ki barabari kabhi samaaj ke liye khushgavaar nahin hoti
 This means that we have the freedom to do what we want to do, just like our straight friends — including our relationship with sex
 hamen or aadha darjan ladaaiyaan abhi jeetni hai—kyonki jab aap homophobia, transphobia, sexism or algebiti yuvaaon ke khilaaf hinsa se nipatane main jute hai, tab iske liye vakt hi nahin he ki koun kiske saath or kitne aksar sex kar rahaa he
 Remember only one thing
 tab tak aap jaise hai, vaise hi rahen
 Or like any other you want to be
 aniruddh mahale tedex spikar hai, desi sandarbh main samalangik samskruti ke liye ek portal gesexual chalaate hai or philhal harperkolins se chhapane vaale apane duusare upanyaas par kaam kar rahe hai

 yah mere lekh ke sabase kam mahatvapurn baton main se ek he
 But looking at the minister's influence, i have placed it in the headline

 My humility is exemplary and exemplary

 True as well as good
 donon kaa kambo(yugma) kam hi deshbhakt main miltaa he jo ki mujhamen miltaa hua dikhaai de rahaa he
 So i am with every statement of Ravi Shankar Prasad
 ek rashtravaadi sarkaar ke mantri kii yogyata kii seemaa nahin hoti
 He is also an economist at the same time
 kanoonvid bhi hota he
 There is also an educationist
 rashtrawaad kii raajnneeti aapako aseemit kshamtaaon se las kar detii he
 Those who make fun of Ravi Shankar Prasad will never understand this
 isliye aap ravishankar prasad ke bayaan kaa mazaaq nahin udaayen
 Rather, his statement should be researched at Harvard
 agar sarkaar khud se ye model nahin bhejti he to ravishankar prasad ko apane kisi parichit ke zarie vahaan bhijwa dena chahie
 In my opinion, Ravi Shankar Prasad has come close to a new model of measuring the economy
 jis par unhen nobel puraskaar bhi mil saktaa he
 That is why i am encouraging them
 aap bhi badhayen
 Do not make fun udaayen bhi to sirf hindi main taaki google search se duniya ke baaki deshon ko pataa na chale or bharat kii badanaami na ho
 Ravi Shankar Prasad has given hard-data in favor of his talk
 2 aktubar ko release hui teen filmon kii ek din kii kamai 120 karod se adhik kamai hui he
 The economy of the country is fine, only then films are doing business
 yah bilkul thik baat he
 The people of the country are with them only then they are finding a new model stronghold of economics
 media ke paas khilaaf jane kaa vikalp hi nahin he
 If someone gets along so much, then what economics can he give, one day in an election meeting he can give lectures on how a nuclear reactor is made
 ise aam aadmi bhi apane gharon main bans-balli lagaakar taiyaar kar saktaa he or isi baat par vah chunaavon main jabardast jeet hasil kar saktaa he
 Which is also going to meet Ravi Shankar Prasad's party in Maharashtra elections
 nirmala sitaraman ne kaha tha ki nai peedi ke noujvaan ola-ubar se chalane lage hai isliye kaaron kii bikri gir gai he
 By the way, he did not say how many cars are added to the ola-uber fleet? The work that Nirmala Sitharaman left unfinished has been completed by Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad
 ravishankar prasad ne nirmala sitaraman ke aadhe-adhure model ko sampoornataa kii disha main aage badhaayaa he
 i encourage them so that they complete it
 ravishankar prasad sabhi bhashaaon kii filmon kaa daily-data lekar ek model bana sakate hai
 So that the daily domestic GDP ie GDP can be estimated daily
 meri raay main bharat sarkaar ko apana ek adhikari rose cinema haul ke counter par bhejnaa chahie
 So that no one can doubt our sample collection

 Time is still ve kuch bhi bolenge to janata saath degi
 Later there will be problems with such research
 isiilie ise public main paas karakar nobel puraskaar le hi lenaa he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said one more thing in the same press conference
 us par hansane kii zarurat he
 Fewer people have the courage to say such a thing
 us saahas ko sahajata se sweekaar karne kii zarurat he
 What Mahaprasad ji has said is amazing
 puuchhie to sahi ki kaha kya he?'main en es es o kii report ko galat kahata hum or puri zimmedaari ke saath kahata hum
 That report does not mention electronic, manufacturing, IT sector, Mudra loan and common service sector
 kyon nahin he? hamane kabhi nahin kaha tha ki ham sabko sarkari naukari denge
 We are still not saying this
 kuch logon ne in aankadon ko yojanabaddh tareeke se galat dhang se pesh kiya he
 i have said this in Delhi too
 'upar vaala paragraph bada he to phir se us saahasik bayaan ko saamne nikaal kar rakh rahaa hum
 'we never said that we will give government job to everyone
 ham ye abhi bhi nahin kah rahe hai
 'in my opinion, the youth have never said that if you do not give jobs, you will not vote
 balki naujavaanon ne naukari na milane par bhi vot diya he or aage bhi denge
 But by making this statement, Ravi Shankar Prasad has lightened the burden of the government
 naujavaanon ko bhi mukti di he
 Throughout the day, these young men leave Zindabad and continue to work
 main iske liye ravishankar prasad ko badhai detaa hum or aane vaale sabhi chunaavon main nishchit jeet kii advance badhai bhi bhejtaa hum
 Since there is a habit of asking questions, then the question does not remain in Khushmad
 isliye puch rahaa hum
 You do not believe the NSSO figures
 45 saal main sabase adhik berojgaare kii baat nahin maanate hai
 You are the boss aap kuch mat maniye
 But i would have made the report public
 to ham bhi dekh lete ki aapaki baat kitni sahi he
 You said that there is no manufacturing in it
 to aapkaa hi data kahata he ki is sector kaa growth negative me chalaa gaya he
 In the last five and a half years, this sector has gone sunk
 to aap bataa dijie ki manuphaccharing main kitni naukariyaan paidaa hui
 Or do you want to take Nobel on this also, that the sector which grows negative growth also generates employment? If NSS0 did not give, then you tell me
 sarkaar main rahul gandhi to nahin hai na
 By the way, minister, do not take too much load
 apni ek or aitihaasik raajnneetik safaltaaon ke jashn kii taiyaari par dhyaan den
 It is more important
 agali baar bol dijiega ki berojgaaron ko libral ne bahaka diya he ki unke paas rojgaar nahin he
 i guarantee that everyone will say yes and in this way the Liberals will also be washed
 bolen ravishankar prasad kii jai
 Speak three times in your room
 libral ke chakkar main pad kar mantri kaa mazaaq na udaayen
 Be a true and good patriot

 Union Minister Najma Heptulla has been growing angry over the statement that it is not wrong to call people living in India as 'hindus', because this is the identity of our nationality
 najma ke us bayaan kii aalochana karte hue congress pravaktaa manish tiwari ne kaha he ki desh main rahane vaale sabhi log 'bhartiya' hai, na ki 'hindu'
 Manish Tiwari said that according to the constitution our country is India and there are Indians living here
 haalanki vivaad khadaa hone par najma hepatulla ne safai di he ki unhone 'hindi' ko rashtriya pahchaan bataaya tha
 i used the Hindi word, not Hindu
 darasal, bijepi netaa or alpsankhyak maamalon kii mantri najma hepatulla ne ek angreji akhbaar ko die intervyuu main kaha tha ki bharat main rahane vaale logon ko hindu kahana katai galat nahin he
 According to Najma, it is a matter of nationality identity
 najma ne kaha tha ki hindukush parvatamala or sindhu nadi ke saath judi puri bhartiya aabaadi hindu he or itihaas kii yah sachai logon ko bhoolanaa nahin chahie
 Significantly, recently, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had said that all the people living in India are Hindus

 With this, he ensured a third medal for India
 yah pehali baar hoga jab bharat ko mukkebaaji main olympic padak milegaa
 If Vijender now wins the semi-final match then he can go for the gold and silver medal
 lekin unke semifinal main pahunchane ke baad yah to tay ho gaya he ki kam-se-kam kaansya to milegaa hi
 This is the first time in Olympic history that India is winning three medals in a single Olympics, with Vijender confirming this medal
 bharat ne isse pehle 1900 ke paris olympic main do rajat or 1952 ke helsinki olympic main ek gold or ek kaansya padak jeeta tha
 The 12 Olympics in which Indian boxers participated never reached the medal round
 vijendra ne aakhir is baadha ko beijing main paar kar hi liya
 When the first round ended, Vijender took a 2–0 lead
 tisare round kii samaapti tak unki badhat 7-2 ho chuki thi
 In the fourth and final round, Gongora tried hard to break Vijendra's defense but thwarting all attempts, the Bhiwani boxer made an impressive 9–4 win against the Ecuadorian boxer
 akhil or jitendra kii haar ke baad desh kii sari ummiden vijendra par hi tiki hui thim or vijendra ne kisi ko niraash nahin kiya
 He won this match and gave the whole country another chance to celebrate

 congress kii ore se randeep surajevaala or priyanka chaturvedi ne press conference kar rafel ko lekar modi sarkaar par rafel main chori karne kaa aarope lagaaya or ek baar phir se kaha ki chaukeedaar ne chori kii he
 Randeep Surjewala quoted the India Negotiation Team as saying that when the Congress government was buying 126 ships, they included transfer of technology
 magar modi sarkaar ke saude main yah nahin he
 He further said that the watchman's third theft was that the watchmen themselves were bypassing the Indian Negotiation Team and negotiating 36 fighter ships
 doston yah sansanikhej baat he ki in 36 jahaajon ke kharidne kaa nirnay indian negoshiation team ne nahin kiya
 It was negotiated by Ajit Doval
 isse pehle congress ne pradhanmantri narendra modi kii ore se rafel saude ko lekar kiye gaye hamale par palatwaar kiya or daawa kiya ki sarkaar ne is ladaaku vimaan kii kharid kii prakriya par gaur karne ke liye gathit ucchstareey samiti kii report kii upeksha kii jis par modi ko jawaab dena chahie
 Senior party leader and former Defense Minister AK Antony accused BJP President Amit Shah of politicizing the Air Force's operation in Balakot and said that the Prime Minister and Shah should avoid it
 antni ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ''main apane sashastr balon kii veerta or balidaan ko salaam karata hum
 We all should support our armed forces
 " unhone daawa kiya, "hamaare pradhanmantri desh main gum rahe hai or galat jaankariyaan failaa rahe hai
 He accused the Congress of delaying the Rafale deal for the commission
 unke is aarope main koi sachai nahin he
 The former defense minister said that it is clear from the CAG report that the previous NDA government wasted four years
 lekin jab samprag sarkaar aayi to hamane prakriya shuru kii
 He said that during the process, BJP leaders Yashwant Sinha and Subramanian Swamy had raised objections
 iske baad ek samiti kaa gathan hua
 The Narendra Modi government ignored the report of this committee
 agar ham sarkaar main rahakar samiti kii report ko nazarandaaj karte to kaig kii kya pratikriya hoti? kya media kaa yahi rukh hota?congress netaa ne kaha, " mujhe yah jaanakar hairaani hui ki is sarkaar main samiti kii report par na to raksha mantralay main charchaa hui or na hi suraksha maamalon kii cabinet samiti main is par vichaar hua
 The Prime Minister must answer why his government ignored the committee's report? ”he alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi compromised the national interests of the country in the deal he signed with France
 tihaad jail main band haryana ke purv mukhyamantri om prakaash chautaala ko saans kii taklaaf kii vajah se jibi pant aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 The Rohini court convicted him in the teacher recruitment scam that took place 13 years ago
 is maamle main 22 janvari ko unhe sajaa sunai jaani he
 Chautala had told the court that he is a patient of diabetes and his age is above 80 years, so he should be treated softly
 kya tha puraa maamla?omprakash chautaala par aarope tha ki unhone haryana rajya ke mukhyamantri pad par rahete hue shikshakon kii bhartee kii jimmedaari karmchaaree chayan ayog se lekar jila str par banaai gai cameti ko saunpane kaa nirdesh diya tha
 On the orders of the Supreme Court, the CBI started the investigation of the JBT teacher recruitment scam in the year 2003
 shikshakon kii niyukti main barti gai aniyamittaaon kaa aarope saamne aane ke baad sibiai ne janvari 2004 main haryana ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri omprakash chautaala sahit kul 62 logon ke viruddh maamla darj kiya
 In the year 2008, the investigating agency filed a charge sheet against the accused in the court
 aaropapatr ke anusaar varsh 1999-2000 main rajya ke 18 jilon main hui 3206 jebiti shikshakon kii bhartee ke maamle main mandandon ko taak par rakhkar manachaahe abhyarthiyon kii bahaali kii gai
 For this, the responsibility of recruitment of teachers was entrusted to the selection committee set up at the district level from the Staff Selection Commission
 isane farji saakshaatkaar ke aadhaar par chaynit abhyarthiyon kii suchi taiyaar kii
 For this, pressure was also made on the officers of the Education Department, who were included in the District Level Selection Committee, in the meetings at Haryana Bhawan in Delhi and Guest House in Chandigarh for the selection of candidates
 kaise saamne aayaa shikshak bhartee ghotaalaa?yah ghotaalaa varsh 1999 se 2000 ke madhya kaa he, jisamen 3206 se adhik shikshakon kii bhartee kii gai thi
 Sanjeev Kumar, an IS officer of the Department of Education, filed a petition in the Supreme Court in the year 2003, after which the investigation was handed over to the CBI
 jebiti bhartee main om prakaash chautaala par list badalawaane kaa aarope tha, jo adaalat main sabit ho gaya
 There were a total of 148 government witnesses in the case, of which 67 testified in court and it was proved that a bribe of Rs 3 to 5 lakh was taken from every person employed in JBT recruitment
 patiala house court,dilli main peshi ke liye pahunche jeenyu ke chaatr netaa kanhaiya kumaar par hue hamale ke ghanton baad dilli police kamishnar bies bassi ne NDTV se kaha ki ve kanhaiya kii jamaanat kaa virodh nahin karenge
 Significantly, the arrest of Kanhaiya on charges of treason has been in the headlines at the national level for the last few days
 police kamishnar bassi kaa bayaan aise samay main aayaa he jab sarkaar or police ko vipaksh ne chunauti di he ki ve is baat ke saboot den ki pichley hafte jeenyu main raily ke dauraan kanhaiya ne rashtravirohi baaten kahin
 There is nowhere in the video of Kanhaiya Kumar running on the internet that he is involved in the group that raised slogans of 'pakistan Zindabad' and vowed to cut India
 lekin jeenyu main hui raily ke do din baad 11 farvari ko darj kii gai exiaar main deshadroh ke aarope lagaae gaye- jisamen adhiktam umrakaid tak kii sajaa ho sakati he- jo ki samachar channel ji news par chale pradarshan kii footage ke aadhaar par kiya gaya
 This is bound to raise the question as 3 police constables were sent to the rally in plain uniform after being given information by JNU officials
 jeenyu adhikariyon ne bataaya tha ki 2001 main sansad par hue hamalon ke doshi afjal guru kii faansee kii sajaa par sawaal uthaane ke liye is kaarykram kaa aayojan kiya gaya tha
 According to the FIR, Head Constable Rambir (no
 2923 / SD), Constable Karmabir (no
 1664 / SD), Constable Dharmabir (no
 3846 / SD) were sent to Sabarmati Dhaba (where the event was held) in plain uniform
 haalanki teenon pulicekarmiyon ne ghatana ko dekha, lekin exiaar main un teenon ke hawaale se kanhaiya kumaar ke bare main kuch bhi nahin kaha gaya he
 Instead, according to the complaint lodged with the police, on February 11, Zee News was asked to give the footage and the channel did the same
 uske baad police cese darj kiya gaya, jise aalochak aaropon kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue jaldbaaji main uthaae gaye kadam ke rup main dekh rahe hai
 Kanhaiya does not appear to raise anti-national slogans in any video available on the Internet
 9 farvari kii raily main use vampanthi chaatro or abivipi ke chaatro ke bich chal rahe shorsharabe ke bich dekha ja saktaa he
 In two videos filmed on February 10, shared on social media, Kanhaiya is seen giving a speech on the stairs in front of jnu's administrative building
 pehle video main kanhaiya kah rahaa he ki kaise vah bhartiya samvidhan kaa sammaan karata he, lekin nagpur (jahaan bijepi ke vaicharik sanghathan aresas kaa mukhyalay he) dwaara thope gaye samvidhan ke khilaaf he
 In the second video he is seen shouting freedom slogans and standing next to Omar Khalid
 umr khalid vahi chaatr he jisane afjal guru mudde ko lekar baithak bulaai thi
 Upon review, we find that Kanhaiya is talking about freedom from casteism and prejudice
 lekin in baton ko bhi police ne deshadroh ke aarope kaa aadhaar nahin banaaya he
 Two clips recorded by mobile phones, in which the slogans of 'pakistan Zindabad' and the sounds of 'india's waste' can be heard, are recorded at night
 inhen dekhakar ye bataanaa ki ve naare koun laga rahaa he, lagbhag naammumkin he
 In another video which is clear and recorded on the day, it is clearly seen that some people are shouting slogans like 'bharat Tere Chote Hoga'
 raily main maujuud kuch logon kaa kahana he ki ye naare lagane vaale bahari log the
 The comments jis chaatr sangh kaa adhyaksh kanhaiya kumaar he, uski upaadhyaksh shehla rashid ne daawa kiya ki unhone vishvavidhyalay ke campus main kabhi bhi aise naare nahin sune the or unhone un logon ko rokane kii koshish bhi kii kyonki ye vampanthi unionon kii vichaardhaara se mail nahin khate
 However, there is no video of this
 haalanki yah abhi tak spasht nahin he ki aayojakon dwaara aisi vichaardhaara vaale logon ko vishvavidhyalay parisar main aamantrit hi kyon kiya gaya
 Police Commissioner Bassi's statement comes at a time when the Opposition has challenged the government and the police to provide evidence that Kanhaiya spoke anti-nationals during a rally in JNU last week
 internet par chal rahe kanhaiya kumaar ke video main kahin bhi nahin dikh rahaa ki vah us samooh main shaamil he jisane 'pakistan jindabad' ke naare lagaae or bharat ke tukade karne kii kasame khain
 But two days after the rally in JNU, the FIR lodged on February 11 alleges treason - which could carry a maximum punishment of life imprisonment - based on footage of the demonstration on news channel Zee News
 isse sawaal uthaanaa lajimi he kyonki jeenyu ke adhikariyon dwaara soochna die jane ke baad police ke 3 consteble saadi vardi main raily main bheje gaye the
 JNU officials had said that the event was organized to question the hanging sentence of Afzal Guru, convicted for the attacks on Parliament in 2001
 exiaar ke anusaar, head consteble rambir (number2923 / SD), consteble karmbir (number 1664 / SD), consteble dharmbir (number 3846 / SD) ko saadi vardi main sabarmati dhaba (jahaan kaarykram yojit hua tha) bheja gaya tha
 Though the three policemen witnessed the incident, nothing has been said about Kanhaiya Kumar in the FIR quoting them
 isaki jagah, police main darj shikaayat ke anusaar 11 farvari ko ji news se footage dene ko kaha gaya or channel ne vaisaa hi kiya
 a police case was then filed, which critics see as a hasty move given the seriousness of the allegations
 internet par uplabdh kisi bhi video main kanhaiya rashtravirohi naare lagaataa nahin dikhataa
 In the rally on 9 February, he can be seen amidst the noise of the students and students of ABVP
 10 farvari ko filmaae gaye do video, jinhen soshal media par share kiya gaya, main kanhaiya jeenyu ke prashasnic bhawan ke saamne sidhiyon par bhaashan detaa dikh rahaa he
 In the first video, Kanhaiya is saying how he respects the Indian Constitution, but is against the Constitution imposed by Nagpur (where bjp's ideological organization RSS is headquartered)
 duusare video main vah aazaadee ke naare lagaataa dikh rahaa he or umr khalid ke bagal main khadaa he
 Omar Khalid is the same student who called a meeting on the Afzal Guru issue
 samiksha karne par pataa chalata he ki kanhaiya jatvaad or purvaagrah se aazaadee kii baat kar rahaa he
 But these things also have not made the basis of treason charge by the police
 mobile phone dwaara record kii gai do clips, jisamen 'pakistan jindabad' ke naare or 'bharat kii barbaadi ' kii awaajen suni ja sakati hai, raat main record kii gai hai
 Seeing them and telling who they are shouting slogans is almost impossible
 ek anya video jo ki spasht he or din main record kiya gaya he, main saaf dikh rahaa he ki kuch log 'bharat tere tukade honge' jaise naare laga rahe hai
 Some people present at the rally say that they were outsiders shouting slogans
 tippaniyan Shehla Rashid, the vice president of the student union that is headed by Kanhaiya Kumar, claimed that he had never heard such slogans on the university campus and tried to stop those people because they did not match the ideology of the leftist unions
 haalanki iskaa koi bhi video maujuud nahin he
 However, it is not yet clear why the organizers were invited by the organizers to the university campus

 isaki jagah, police main darj shikaayat ke anusaar 11 farvari ko ji news se footage dene ko kaha gaya or channel ne vaisaa hi kiya
 a police case was then filed, which critics see as a hasty move given the seriousness of the allegations

 In the second video he is seen shouting freedom slogans and standing next to Omar Khalid
 umr khalid vahi chaatr he jisane afjal guru mudde ko lekar baithak bulaai thi
 Upon review, we find that Kanhaiya is talking about freedom from casteism and prejudice
 lekin in baton ko bhi police ne deshadroh ke aarope kaa aadhaar nahin banaaya he
 Two clips recorded by mobile phones, in which the slogans of 'pakistan Zindabad' and the sounds of 'india's waste' can be heard, are recorded at night

 The Bombay High Court has rejected a decision of the Family High Court in which the couple's divorce was approved on the basis of the wife's partying
 mahila ke pati ne daleel di thi ki uski patni aksar party main jaaya karti thi or usase badtamiji se pesh aati thi
 The 42-year-old Rajesh Chawla (name changed) from Navi Mumbai had argued that his wife Seema (name changed) often used to party late into the night

 Senior Congress leader and former Law Minister Hansraj Bhardwaj today attacked former Finance Minister p Chidambaram for blaming former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the 2G spectrum issue and alleged that Chidambaram was 'fully responsible' for the scam
 
 karnataka ke rajyapal rah chuke bharadwaj ne 2ji mudde par chidambaram kii daleelein khaarij karte hue kaha ki agar unhone vittamantri ke taur par sarkari khajaane kaa khyaal thik se rakhaa hota to yah ghotaalaa nahin hota
 Bhardwaj said, 'I don't think what Chidambaram is saying is correct
 yah to bilkul ulti baat he
 The Prime Minister had indicated to all ministers that transparency should be maintained in the 2G case
 ' unhone kaha, 'unhone (manmohan ne) desh kii utkrisht seva kii he
 Chidambaram is nothing compared to him
 unki eemaandaaree evam nishtha ko antarrashtriya str par mana jaataa he
 ' bharadwaj ne daawa kiya ki chidambaram to kabhi congressi the hi nahin
 He said, 'tell me when he (chidambaram) was a Congressman? He has always changed parties
 ' Bhardwaj said, 'chidambaram used to bully his language and education on everyone
 maine har jagah unka kaam dekha he
 He is fully responsible in 2G
 ' Asked if Priyanka Gandhi should be brought forward to bring the Congress back to a strong position, Bhardwaj said, "I urge the Congress leadership to bring them forward immediately
" ' Significantly, earlier, Chidambaram had said that the UPA government could have dealt with the 2G case better
 satrahavin loksabhaa kii shuruyaat ho chuki he
 The first two days of the Parliament session were held for the swearing in of mps
 is dauraan loksabhaa kaa najaara bilkul hi alag dikhaa, zyaadaatar navnirvaachit saansadon ne niyamon ke viruddh jaakar shapath ke baad dharmik pahchaan se jude naare lagaae
 In the Lok Sabha, the way in which the slogans of Allah Hu Akbar were being raised in response to Jai Sri Ram amid the tokatoki and uproar, after that it is clear that the swearing in is a trailer and in the coming days there will be a fierce barricade in the Parliament
 
 darasal loksabhaa main shapath grahan ke dauraan dharmik pahchaan se jude naare lagaae ja rahe the
 While many mps in the Lok Sabha raised their ideological slogans after the oath, most of the mps followed the oath, Jai Shri Ram, Jai Maa Kali, Jai Bhim, Jai Socialism, Radhe Radhe, Vahe Guru Di Khalasa Vahe Guru Di Fateh, Allah Hu Akbar And shouted slogans like Constitution Zindabad
 vahiin, ek saansad ne vande maataram ko islam ke khilaaf bataaya
 Due to this, the Protem Speaker had to say many times that apart from the oath, no other thing was to go on record
 loksabhaa main shapath lene ke liye jab bhi koi saansad aa rahaa tha to bijepi ke saansad jayshri ram kaa naaraa lagane lagate
 At the same time, when MP came from Bari Sambhal, Shafiqur Rahman Burke, BJP mps stepped up the slogan of Jayshree Ram and Vande Mataram
 shapath lene ke baad bark ne kaha, 'bharat kaa samvidhan jindabad
 'after this, Burke called Vande Mataram against Islam
 is par sadan main bijepi saansadon ne shem shem ke naare lagaae
 Meanwhile, in the Lok Sabha, the turn of the swearing-in of Asimuddin Owaisi, Chief of AIMIM, was witnessed in the House
 ovaisi apni seat se jaise hi uthakar shapath ke liye wel main aae bijepi saansadon ne jayshri ram, vande maataram or bharat mata kii jai ke lagane shuru kar die
 After this Owaisi completed his oath and finally shouted slogans of Jai Bhim, Jai Mim, allah-hu-akbar and Jai Hind
 isi tarah se pashchim bengal kii murshidaabad seat jitkar aae saansad abu taahir khan choudhary ne bhi bijepi saansadon ke naare ke jawaab main inshallah, jai hind , jai bangala, khuda hafiz or allaah-hu-akbar kaa naaraa lagaaya
 Please tell that after taking oath, Hemamalini shouted slogans of Radhe Radhe and Krishnam Vande Jagat Guru
 uttar pradesh ke salempur se bijepi saansad rabindra kushvaha ne shapath lene ke baad 'jai yogi-jai modi' bolaa
 After the oath by the BSP members, the members of the SP shouted slogans of Jai Socialism
 isse pehle satr ke pehle din bhopal se saansad banakar ai sadhvi pragna singh thakur ke shapath grahan ke dauraan jamkar hangaamaa hua
 Sadhvi took the oath by adding the name of Swami Purna Chetanananda Awadheshanand Giri in front of her name, to which the opposition mps objected
 sadhvi ke samarthan main bijepi ke kai saansad bhi seat se uthakar narebaaji karne lage, aakhir main sadhvi ne ishwar ke naam par shapath grahan kii
 Such a view was first noticed during the swearing-in of mps in the Lok Sabha, when such a large number of mps were seen chanting religious slogans and fiercely barricaded after the oath
 vahiin, upie kii adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne vipakshi dalon ke saath baithkar sansad main sarkaar ko gherne kii ranneeti banaai he
 After the swearing-in, it is clear that even though the opposition may not be very powerful, they will not back down from raising their voice in Parliament
 bajet main ghoshit swasthya beemaa kii 'neshnal health protection skim' ko lagu karne ke liye sarkaar 'aadhaar' number kaa istemaal kar sakati he taaki iskaa laabh sahi hakdaaron ko mili
 With the help of Aadhaar, the amount of the insurance claim will be directly transferred to the hospital account through Director Benefit Transfer (DBT)
 iske pehle fertilizer sabsidi ke maamle main aisa prayog kiya ja chukaa he
 Economic Times quoted sources as saying that during the discussion among senior officials of the government to implement the scheme known as 'modicare', it was also discussed that the Aadhaar card should be used for this
 gauratlab he ki aadhaar act kii dhara 7 main kaha gaya he ki bharat sarkaar ke samekit nidhi se yadi kisi yojana ke liye kharch kiya jaataa he to usko aadhaar se link karnaa hoga
 To raise Rs 11,000 crore for this scheme, the Finance Minister has imposed an additional cess of 1 per cent in the budget
 yuidiai ke siio ajay bhushan pandey ne kaha ki aadhaar se aise kaaryakramon ko sahi dhang se chalaane main madad mil sakati he
 Those who are rightfully entitled will not face any difficulty in availing insurance
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne apane bajet spich main bataaya tha ki yojana ke tahat 10 karodagareeb pariwaronyani kareeb 50 karod logon ko salanaa 5 lakh rupee kaa swasthya beemaa cover diya jayega
 Senior government officials say that such a large scheme with 50 crore beneficiaries cannot be implemented without Aadhaar
 gauratlab he ki abhi kareeb 14-15 karod logon ko milane vaali alpiji sabsidi ko bhi aadhaar or debiti ke dwaara hi dena padataa he
 These benefits will be the advantage of the base that it will give a cleanliness of the people, and due to having an Aadhaar card, a person can start his treatment immediately after reaching the hospital

 Syed Mudassar Hussain alias Munna Jhingada, who is imprisoned in Bangkok jail, was declared a Pakistani citizen by a court there after a long hearing
 iske baad iesai or daaud ke log use bainkak se pakistan le gaye
 Let me tell you that in the year 2000, Munna Jhingada attacked Chhota Rajan in Bangkok
 iske baad bainkak police ne use pakistani passport ke saath giraftaar kiya tha
 Legal war between india-pak For quite some time, a legal battle was going on between the Indian Investigation Agency and the Pakistani Investigation Agency in a Bangkok court over Munna Jhingada's citizenship, in which India had won
 lekin iske baad daaud ke ishaare par iesai (ISI) ne adaalat main phir se apil kii
 The Bangkok court considered Munna to be Pakistan's most wanted underworld don Dawood, who poured money like water for Munna and tried to prove Munna Jhingada as a Pakistani citizen based on fake documents
 iske baad adaalat ne saiyad muddasar hossain urf munna ko pakistani naagarik ghoshit kar diya
 The Pakistani intelligence agency ISI and d Company then took him from Bangkok to Karachi
 jahaan wo daud ibrahim ke saath milakar apana dhandha chalaayegaa
 Munna, who was imprisoned in Bangkok for many years, before this, Syed Mudassar Hussain alias Munna was kept under heavy security in the oldest and high security prison on the Chai Road of Bangkok
 use kaidi nambar 8 mila tha
 For the past 2 years, there was a legal war between Hindustan and Pakistan in the Faroe Criminal Court of Bangkok
 munna kii castady chaahate the donon deshek taraf hindustan saiyad mudassar hossain urf munna jhingaada ko apana naagarik bataa rahaa tha, to duusari taraf padosi mulk pakistan use mohammad saleem bataate hue apana naagarik hone kaa daawa karata tha
 The question was, what is it like that the legal war between the two countries broke out for the prisoner number 8, who is imprisoned in Bangkok
 jhingaada ke seene main dafn hai 'don' ke kai rajdrasal, pakistan khufia agency iesai or bharat ke most wonted anderworld don daaud ibrahim ke bich gathjod ke kai ahm raaj mudassar hossain urf munna jhingaada ke seene main dafn hai
 In such a situation, the Indian agency and the Indian government felt that Mudassar Hussain could be exposed to Pakistan internationally by taking his custody
 bharat ke liye ahm tha munnalekin pakistan ne baqayada mohammad saleem ke passport ke saath bainkak kii adaalat or vahaan kii sarkaar ke saamne daawa thok diya tha ki wo mohammad saleem he, jo saal 2000 main bainkak aayaa tha
 Although Munna Jhingada was in jail in Bangkok since 2000, but efforts to bring Jhingada to India had intensified at that time
 jab pradhanmantri narendra modi saal 2016 ke navambar maah main bainkak gaye the
 Mudassar Hussain aka Munna Jhingada can prove to be important for India
 koun he mudassar hossain saiyad urf munna jhingaadamumbai ke jogeshwari kaa rahane vaala jhingaada ek gangster tha
 He is very close to Dawood Ibrahim and Chhota Shakeel
 munna ke khilaaf mumbai main 70 se zyada aapraadhik mukademen darj hai
 Munna is so fearless and sharp shooter that Dawood sent Munna to kill his known enemy Arun Gawli in his area
 saal 1997 main jhingaada ko daaud ne nepal ke raste pakistan bulaayaa or karachi main bijness karvaa diya
 Munnasal was arrested after the attack on Chhota Rajan
 In 2000 Dawood gave the task of killing his known enemy Chhota Rajan and sent him to Bangkok on the fake passport of Mohammed Salim with the help of ISI and Munna Jhingada attacked Bangla in Bangkok
 
 us hamale main rajan ko goli to lagi lekin wo batch gaya
 While Rajan's partner Rohit Verma was killed in this shootout
 phir bainkak police ne munna ko varsh 2000 main hi giraftaar kar liya tha
 Since then, he is in jail there

 patna ke esaspi manumahaaraj ne bataaya ki is maamle main do logon kii giftaar hui he
 Manu Maharaj said that Mr
 Mathew and his wife Jessica Mathew are residents of the United Kingdom
 vah bharat adventure trip ke liye aae hue hai
 He was in Patna for the last 3 days and on the morning of November 5, he stayed and cooked food on the island of Pandarak in Patna
 usee dauraan do apradhi aae or bandook dikhaakar unhen daraane lage
 Criminals also treated Sallanians indecently
 lekin videshi danpati ne bahaduree dikhaai or nadi main apni boat ke sahare utar gaye

 jiske baad eespi, esechao pandarak or antipisi ne karrwai karte hue donon aparaadhiyon ko do ghante ke andar giraftaar kar liya
 Also recovered his boat, but his tent was not found
 giraftaar kiye gaye aparaadhiyon main ek kaa naam chhathu mahato or duusare kaa naam baiju kumaar he
 Both are residents of Paithani Chak Bind Tola of Pandarak police station area
 2019 loksabhaa chunaav kaa bigul ek tarah se foonka ja chukaa he
 Political parties are engaged in seat sharing with their respective partners
 bihar main endie main seat bantwaare ko lekar khinchataan shuru ho gai he
 Meanwhile, a senior leader of the bjp's Bihar unit claimed that the party would field its candidates in all the 22 seats it had won in the last Lok Sabha elections
 is par pratikriya jaahir karte hue jadyu ke ek varisht netaa ne bhaajapa ko chunauti di ki vah mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke vishwasaneey or sweekaarya chehre ke bagaiyr hi sabhi 40 loksabhaa siton par chunaav lade
 Significantly, JDU has been insisting that BJP should consider him as "elder brother"
 bhaajapa ke pradesh mahasachiv rajendra singh ne sasaram main patrakaron se baatcheet main kaha ki bhaajapa un sabhi siton par apane ummidavaar utaaregi jin par use 2014 main jeet mili thi
 The party will also protect the interests of its allies and make a seat-sharing agreement that helps the NDA win all 40 seats in Bihar
 ’’gauratlab he ki loksabhaa main bihar se bhaajapa ke 22 saansad hai
 Apart from this, NDA partners LJP and RLSP have six and three mps respectively
 nitishaki aguwai vaale jadyu ne 2014 kaa loksabhaa chunaav akele dam par ladaa tha or use sirf do siten naseeb hui thim
 Reacting to the BJP leader's statement, JDU legislative councilor and spokesperson Sanjay Singh said that nobody would benefit from issuing such statements, even at a time when the NDA needs to remain united
 singh ne kaha , ‘‘jadyu bihar main rajg main bada bhai he, yah ek tathy he, koi ichha he
 Can the BJP come down and achieve electoral success without the credible and acceptable face of Nitish Kumar? If she thinks she can do it, she should fight on all 40 seats on her own
 karporate labist nira radia ne 2009 ke aam chunaav ke baad dramuk saansad kanimojhi tathaa pramukh udyogpatiyon se meljol rakhaa tha taaki yah sunishchit kiya ja sake ki e raja hi doorsanchaar mantri bane
 The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said this in a document presented in court in the 2G spectrum scam
 radia par aarope he ki unhone doorsanchaar mantralay ke liye gutbaji (labing) kii thi
 The evidence of his proximity to politicians, entrepreneurs and journalists is his statement before the investigating agency
 yah bayaan sibiai dwaara 2ji maamle main daakhil aaropapatr kaa hissaa he
 Accordingly, Radia discussed about the "coincidence" of meeting the telecom ministry Raja and warned him to keep distance from Reliance ADAG chief Anil Ambani
 radia ne raja ko doorsanchaar mantralay dilaane ke bare main bharti airtel ke chairman sunil bharti mittal se bhi baat kii
 Radia had asked Kanimozhi to play an active role in this regard as ndtv's group editor Barkha Dutt and other journalists had referred to the DMK and Congress skepticism about the formation of the cabinet
 vaishnavi communications kii adhyaksh nira radia ne sibiai ko bataaya, 'meraa kahana he ki 2009 ke aam chunaav parinaamon ke baad meri kanimoi karunanidhi se yah baatcheet hui thi
 This conversation was about the DMK and internal politics
 maine unhen suzav diya ki ve ekta ke saath saath apane kariyar ke liye party ke bheetar tathaa apane pita ke saath sakriy bhoomika nibhaaen
 'radia said before the CBI that he also discussed the' coincidence 'etc
 of being given the telecom ministry to A
 Raja
 radia ne is maamle main kanimoi, raja tathaa sunil bharti mittal se bhi baatcheet kii
 According to Radia, she was watching the politics of Drmukh etc
 very closely
 radia ne kaha ki aam chunaavon ke parinaamon ke baad barkhaa dutt tathaa anya patrakaron ne mantrimandal gathan ko lekar dramuk tathaa congress ke bich sanshay ke bare main bataaya tha or unhone is jaankaree ko raja tathaa kanimoi ke saath baanta

 "what could be the life event of this boxer, which we can see as a big message? Is that event of life to include women's boxing in the 2012 Olympics, so that we can see Mary Kom's victory in those Ignore the neglected women cricket players, who are not getting much praise and enough support
 khel main mahaan khiladinnon kii jivan gaathaayen usee kshan mode leti hai, jab ve khel ke liye apana sab kuch ganvaane kaa jokhim uthaane kaa faisla karte hai or khud ko jeet ke liye samarpit kar dete hai
 However, they know very well that there is no guarantee of success in the career they are choosing and it can end anytime
 apane kariyar kii shuruyaat main jab main khiladinnon se baat karti thi to hameshaa hi unase is bare main sawaal karti thi or mujhe har baar neeras-sa jawaab mil jaataa tha
 It made me understand that great players are completely different from me and you
 ve jokhim shabd ko us arth main nahin dekhte hai, jis arth main ham-aap dekhte hai
 We can find the answer by looking at the events of his life
 landan olympic main kamaal dikhaane se pehle hi mairi com mahila boxing kii diggaj khilaadi thim
 She had won the title of world champion five times and by the time of winning the Olympic medal had passed her best phase in boxing
 olympic main mahila boxing ko 2012 main shaamil kiya gaya
 Mary Kom did not let that chance of participating in the contest go away
 olympic main unka bhaar varg (pinvet 46 kilo, baad main 48 kilo) nahin tha, isliye unhone vajan (flivet, 51 kilo) badhaayaa
 He prepared himself to suit the occasion
 aisa karte hue unhone dikhaa diya ki is tarah ke maukon se jivan kii avismaraneey ghatnaon ko gadha ja saktaa he or ve ghatnaayen prerak shakti banakar khel parampara ko aage le ja sakati hai
 The way women are getting opportunities in many sports today, the progress being made in sports can be judged clearly
 aap iskaa andaja olympic khelon se laga sakate hai
 With the withdrawal of wrestling from the Olympics in the past, the sport was threatened
 aise main astitv bachaane ke liye ek tarika apanaaya gaya: purushon ke medal ghataae gaye or mahilaon ke liye medal sankhya badha di gai
 Babita Phogat, who won the gold medal in the Commonwealth Games from the mention of increasing the medal numbers for women, glowed with pride
 unke khel ne pratiyogita ke sabase oonche str par mahilaon ke liye pehle se zyada jagah bana lee he
 Whether or not they win a medal in the Olympics is another matter
 lekin unke liye kam se kam sambhaavnaaen to maujuud hai or vahi zyada myne rakhane vaali baat he
 Try to tell this thing to the women cricket players of the country as well
 asian khelon main medal jeetne kaa a'chaa mauka he, lekin ve is maheene dakshin korea main inchion jane vaale dal main bhartiya mahila cricketer maujuud nahin hongi
 Women's cricket is included there
 lekin abhi haal main england main test match jeetne vaali bhartiya mahila cricketer usamen hissaa lene kaa sapana dekhne kii bhi himmat nahin kar saktin
 The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), which took charge of women's cricket in the country in 2006 as part of the reform campaign at the behest of the International Cricket Council, will not allow the women's team to participate in the Asian Games
 purushon kii team ke prasaaran munaafe ko kisi ke saath saajha karne se bachane vaala bisisiai kai khelon vaale kisi bhi toornament main hissaa nahin legaa
 It does not matter to him that it is against the spirit of the game
 use is baat se bhi koi fark nahin padataa ki aisa karne se cricket ko olympic main mauka milane kii sambhaavna khatm ho jaati he
 Within the veil of autonomy, the BCCI has opposed plans to include cricket in the Olympics
 use is baat kii bhi chintaa nahin he ki padak jeetne vaali pratiyogita main shaamil hone se tii20 ke khel ko sthapit khel ke taur par apni pahchaan banane main madad milegi
 Because of the desire to keep Indian cricket in its possession, the BCCI will not allow its women cricket players to participate in any major event
 isaki tulana main test match khilne vaale asia ke duusare desh—pakistan (guwangjhu main pichley asian khelon main udghaatan pratiyogita main gold medal vijeta), bangladesh or srilanka—apni mahila timen bhej rahe hai
 Now tell me how far it is appropriate to deprive a player from the events of life that can illuminate the career of an Indian female cricketer

 Piyush Chawla's beautiful leg break and Harbhajan Singh's clever bowling showed India's unmatched strength of their spin attack ahead of the World Cup, beating their previous three-time champions Australia by 38 runs in the practice match

 No half-century partnership was played by India and his entire team 44
 3 over main 214 ran par simat gai
 Chawla took four for 31 and Harbhajan took three wickets for 15 runs and proved that score too big for Australia
 australian team ke liye acchhee baat yah rahi ki chot se ubarne ke baad vaapasi karne vaale captain riki ponting (85 gend par 57 ran) ballebaaji kaa paryaapt abhyaas karne main safal rahe
 Apart from him, only the opening pair of Tim Paine (37) and Shane Watson (33) managed to get some runs, but the entire team 37, losing the last nine wickets for 58 runs
 5 over main 176 ran par dher ho gai
 Chawla once showed more faith in his googly, but today he offered a life-style sample of leg breaks and sliders and played a key role in destroying the Australian middle order
 watasan or pen ne pehle wicket ke liye 51 ran kii saajhedaari karke australia ko dhamaakedaar shuruyaat di
 Ponting and Penn added 67 runs for the second wicket, but only a fall of wickets was seen thereafter

 It was started by Yuvraj with the pen out, after which Chawla bowled Michael Clarke (0) on a great leg break and then showed Cameron White and David Hussey the pavilion on consecutive balls
 calum fagarusan ko jeevandaan mila, lekin vah iskaa phayda nahin uthaa paae or agle over main chawla ke jaal main funs gaye
 Harbhajan Singh ensured India's victory by dismissing one end Ponting, Mitchell Johnson (15) and Jason Krejza
 isse pehle sahvaag ko chhodkar koi bhi bhartiya ballebaaj australian tej gendbaajon kaa datakar saamana nahin kar paaya
 Virat Kohli (21), Dhoni (11) and Suresh Raina (12) all spent some time at the crease, but lost their wickets when the team needed it

 jaaniye kya kehete hai aankade :saujany:news Flicks There is a stir in the political circles of Pakistan over the remarks of deposed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on the Mumbai attacks
 vahiin, pakistani sena main bhi khalabali machi hui he
 This is the reason that the Pakistan Army has convened a high-level meeting on Monday to discuss Nawaz's statement
 sharif ne pehali baar saarvajanik rup se ek saakshaatkaar main mana ki pakistan main aatanki sanghathan sakriy hai
 He questioned Pakistan's policy of allowing 'non-governmental elements' to cross the border and kill people
 sharif ne kaha tha ki kya pakistan ko 'sarkaar itar tatwon' ko seemaa paar karne or mumbai main logon kii 'hatya karne' kii anumati deni chahie
 Pakistan Army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor said on Twitter that Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi was suggested to convene a meeting of the high-powered National Security Committee (NSC)
 enessi sheersh asainya tathaa sainya netritv kaa manch he jo mahatvapurn rashtriya muddon par charchaa karti he
 In an exclusive interview with Dawn on Friday, Sharif also criticized the delay in carrying out the trial related to the Mumbai attacks

 These people say that Sharif has supported the Indian stand in the Mumbai attacks by making a statement and has damaged the national interests of the country
 cricketer se netaa bane imran khan ne kaha ki sharif (bharat ke pradhanmantri) narendra modi kii bhashaa bol rahe hai or desh ko nuksaan pahunchane ke liye pakistan ke dushmano kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 World TV reported that a person has approached the police of Chakwal district to register a case against Sharif for damaging the security of the country
 is bich, navaj sharif ke chote bhai shahbaaj sharif ne kaha ki media ne purv pradhanmantri ke bayaan ko galat tareeke se pesh kiya he
 He said, 'can anyone believe that Nawaz Sharif would say such a thing
 'mere bayaan kii galat vyakhya kii gai: sharifvahin, mumbai main 2008 main hue aatanki hamale par apane kaboolname ko lekar sabhi virgon ke nishane par aaye pakistan ke purv pradhanmantri navaj sharif ne ravivaar ko daawa kiya ki media ne unki tippaniyon kii 'galat vyakhya' kii
 Sharif in an interview publicly acknowledged for the first time that terrorist organizations are active in Pakistan
 unhone seemaa paar karne tathaa mumbai main logon kii 'hatya' ke liye 'rajya se itar tatwon' ko anumati dene kii niti par sawaal uthaaya tha
 The former Prime Minister of Pakistan (68) had said that Pakistan has isolated itself
 paak media ne dushprachaar ko bal diyasharif ke pravaktaa ne kaha, 'shuru main bhartiya media ne navaj sharif ke bayaan kii galat vyakhya kii
 Unfortunately, without knowing all the facts of the statement, a section of electronic and social media of Pakistan also not only confirmed it intentionally or unknowingly, but also promoted the propaganda of the Indian media
 'sarkaar kootnithik kadam uthaae: congresspakistan ke purv pradhanmantri navaj sharif kii apane desh main aatankwaadi samoohon kii sakriyata ko lekar sweekaarokti ke baad congress ne aaj sarkaar se kaha ki vah bharat main aatanki gatividhiyon main pakistan kii sanliptata ko antarrashtriya samudaay ke samaksh rekhaankit karne ke liye kootnithik kadam uthaaye
 Congress leader Pawan Khedane also called for the international community to take action against Pakistan for conducting terrorist activities in India
 unhone kaha ki ham ummid karte hai ki sarkaar ab aisa karegi or sunishvith karegi ki sharif ne jo kaha he, use antarrashtriya samudaay sangyaan main legaa or pakistan ke khilaaf uchit karrwai karegaa

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar once again demanded a caste census
 nitish kumaar kaa kahana he ki ek baar jatigat janaganana ho jane par jab saare tathy saamne aa jaaenge to us hisaab se kyon nahin aarakshan hoga or kab tak ek seemaa tak aarakshan rahegaa
 Nitish was addressing a function organized by the party on Karpoori Jayanti in Patna on Thursday
 unhone kaha ki ek sandarbh main 50 pratishat kii seemaa laga di gayi he lekin ek baar jatigat janaganana puure taur par ho jaaegi to uske baad thik dhang se samvidhan main praavdhaan karke koi upyukt upaay kiya ja saktaa he taaki sabko iskaa laabh mili
 It is clear from the words of Nitish Kumar that at this time he does not expect that there is no such provision in the immediate present reservation rule to increase it
 nitish ne kaha ki aabaadi jaise bad rahi he aisi paristhiti main adhik aarakshan kii maang jaays he lekin iskaa samaadhaan he jatigat janaganana
 Nitish did not name Lalu Yadav or his son Tejashwi Yadav but reminded that when the Mandal Commission recommendation was implemented, a conspiracy was hatched to end the provision of reservation in Bihar from the time of Karpoori Thakur
 lekin unhone jab chetavanee di ki ham bardaasht nahin karenge tab unke kilaaf pradarshan karaane kii koshish kii gayi
 PM Modi's attack on the opposition, said - the reservation of the upper caste got the sleep of the opposition parties
 Nitish reminded the people that when Karpoori Thakur implemented the reservation system due to which more backward castes got more benefits then campaigning was also done against them
 But he was not deterred
 chunaav ke maddenzar nitish ne ati pichhadi jatiyon main sendhamari kii koshishon ke bare main bhi charchaa kii or kaha ki agar aap alag-alag rahenge to sab log uskaa laabh uthaaenge lekin agar aap ekajute rahenge to aap ek bahumanjila imaarat bana sakate hai or log aapke ird gird ghumenge

 They were taken out in the morning because the Ganges was about to enter
 kuch saal pehle tak kii baat he jab bharat ke koi badi shrinkhalaa haarane (khaas taur par pakistan se) par bahut bavaal hota tha or kaha jaataa tha ki ye match 'fiks' tha
 Initially, former cricketers or 'experts' used to dismiss such possibilities outright saying that no player can betray the country
 phir kahani kii paraten khulani shuru huin aar pataa chalaa ki daal main kuch kaala jarur he
 Some players from almost every country's team were banned from playing financial or cricket
 pakistan ke purv captain rashid latif ne to chilla-chilla kar kaha ki takreeban har antarrashtriya match fiks hota he, or unhone sharajah ko phixing kaa garh bataaya
 Well, the board of several countries took some steps and then it was assumed that 'all is Well
 ' log samajhane lage ki bhadrapurushon kaa ye khel phir se saaf-suthra ho gaya he
 But in 2010, a case came to light that told us that over time the method of fixing has also changed
 isi saal england daure par gayi pakistani team ke teen sadsy, ek sting oparation ke anusaar, 'spot phixing' main shaamil the
 When the whole matter came to light, it was learned that fast bowlers Mohammad Aamir and Mohammad Asif had deliberately thrown a 'no ball' at the behest of their captain Salman Butt
 ab no ball karnaa koi gunaah to nahin he, to isapar itnaa bavaal kyon hua?'vidwaan' bataate hai ki is prakaar kii chijen phixing kaa 'nayaa rup' hai, jisase saanp bhi mar jaataa he or lathi bhi nahin tuutati
 Betting on sports is legal in some countries, including England, and the power is not just on which team will win the match, but also on small matters, such as whether a ball will be 'wide' or no ball in a particular over
 , Or whether a batsman will play the 'over' maiden or not? Now suppose that the captain and bowler of a team is in your fist
 aap use 10 rupee dekar kehete hai ki bhaiya, match kaa 20waan over falaan gendbaaj se karwaanaa or use kahana ki over kii duusari gend no ball karnaa
 Now you have put 100 bets on the same thing that the second ball of the 20th over will be no ball and in this case, take 500 rupees less than it
 to aisa karke aapane motaa munafa bhi kam liya or match fiks bhi nahin hua
 a single run of that no ball is unlikely to make any significant difference in the outcome of the test match, and fixing did not happen
 'satta vidwaan' ye bhi kehete hai ki ho saktaa he ki har match kaa nateeja fiks na ho, lekin haal ke saalon main jo itane zyada 'kareebi match' khele ja rahe hai, uske peeche mul rup se spot phixing hi he
 Big bookies, who have close relations with the players, decide the direction of the match
 logon ne kis team par kitna paisa satte main lagaaya he, buki usee anusaar satte ke bhav or match kaa rukh tay karte hai taaki unhen khud isse zyada se zyada phayda ho
 In the end, the outcome of the match may be in favor of the team whose results were expected to be in favor, but the bookies take less profit from the betting due to the ups and downs of the match
 yaa, jaise ipel main hue taaja khulaase main saamne aayaa he, ki koi ek gendbaaj kisi ek khaas ishaare se apane buki ko bataa degaa ki wo is over main adhik ran dene ja rahaa he, or buki baithe-baithe achche paise kam letaa he, jiskaa kuch hissaa khilaadi ko bhi milegaa
 In such a situation, the result of the match did not make much difference, the players also survived the 'stigma of fixing' the match and the 'upper' earnings were also made
 lekin galat to galat hi he, chaahe wo match phixing ho yaa spot phixing!!jab match phixing ke maamle saamne aae to 'aklmand logon' ne spot phixing ko izaad kiya; ab dekhte hai ki spot phixing saamne aane par koi nayaa avishkaar hota he kya? asaar puure hai, kyon kuch vidwaan ye bhi kah gaye hai- baap bada na bhaiya, sabase bada rupaiya! The Congress is engaged in alliances with different political parties in different states to win the political war of 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 is kadi main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne aam aadmi party ke saath gathbandhan ke mudde par dilli main party ke varisht netaaon kii baithak bulaai, jisamen tay hua he ki congress dilli main AAP ke saath milakar chunaav nahin ladegi
 After a meeting with Rahul Gandhi, Delhi Congress state president Sheila Dikshit has made it clear that the Congress will not form an alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi
 shila ne kaha, ' hamane rahulji ko bataaya ki AAP ke saath gathbandhan nahin karnaa chahie
 They have agreed to this
 'haalanki unhone kaha ki AAP ko gathbandhan kii baadhyataa dikhaa rahi ho, lekin ham taiyaar nahin he
 We have decided unanimously that the Congress party will not contest the elections together with the AAP
 bataa den ki aam aadmi party ke saath gathbandhan ke liye congress adhyaksh rahul gadhi ke awaas par dopaher main hogi
 Rahul has called Delhi Pradesh Congress President Sheila Dixit as well as the three working presidents - former mlas Harun Yusuf, Rajesh Lilothia and Devendra Yadav
 iske alaava party ke purv adhyakshon ko bhi ukt baithak main bulaayaa gaya he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has long insisted on an alliance with the Congress
 dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal to yahaan tak kah chuke the ki ham to taiyaar hai, lekin congress iske liye taiyaar nahin he
 He has said this in the interview given to Aaj Tak as well
 ab badale hue raajnneetik halaat main ek baar phir se gathbandhan kii kavayad shuru hui he
 It is believed that in the meeting of Delhi Pradesh Congress leaders with Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday, the alliance can be sealed
 sutron kii maane to dilli kii 7 loksabhaa siton ko lekar formula bhi sujhaayaa gaya he
 Under this, Congress 3, Aam Aadmi Party 3 and one seat can go to the account of independents

 (from input language) ashutosh maharaj keantim sanskaar maamlemen punjab or haryana hoicourt kii dabl bench ab 11 disambar ko sunwaayee karegi
 The court gave Friday only by giving a date
 jalandhar ke divya jyoti jagriti santhaan nurmahal ke pramukh ashutosh maharaj kii samadhi yaa maut ke maamle main court main apil daayar kii gai he
 The body of Ashutosh Maharaj has been kept in Heideep freezer since last January
 ye apil hoicourt ke us faisle ke khilaaf daayar kiya gaya he jisamen court ne ashutosh maharaj koclinical dadamante hue 15 dinon ke andyantim sanskarakarne kaa aadesh diya he
 Now Divya Jyoti Sansthan has filed an appeal against this decision of the High Court in a double bench of the High Court itself, which can be heard today
 hoicourt ne ashutosh maharaj ko samadhi se nikaal kar unka antim sanskaar karne kii jo mohalat di he wo mohalat 15 disambar ko khatm ho rahi he
 That is, according to the court order, the funeral should be done before December 15
 magar mahraaj ke saadhakon ne unke ashram yani divya jyoti jagriti santhaan main 14 or 15 disambar ko hi vishaal satsang ke aayojan kaa elaan kar diya he
 On the other hand, a man named Dilip Kumar Jha, who calls himself the son of Ashutosh Maharaj, has asserted his right to the body
 unke mutabik unhen apane pita kii antyeshti karne kaa adhikaar milanaa chahie
 The petitioner Dilip has also questioned the death of Ashutosh Maharaj
 unke mutabik iske peeche gahari sajeesh he
 Puran Singh, the oldest Rajdar and driver of Ashutosh Maharaj, has alleged that some of his seekers had given him the color of a tomb to suppress the case by killing him in order to grab the wealth of Arabs
 puuran singh ne bhi hoicourt main yachika daayar kar maamle kii jaanch sibiai se karaane kii apil kii he
 Doctor Ashutosh Maharaj has been declared dead on 29 January 2014
 lekin maharaj ke bhakt ye maanane ko taiyaar hi nahin hai
 He says that Maharaj himself is absorbed in deep samadhi of his own free will
 or aise main unka antim sanskaar karnaa to dur, uske bare main sochna bhi naammumkin he or maharaj ke inhen bhakton ne unki laash ko jalandhar ke paas nurmahal ashram main ek freezer main band kar rakhaa he
 There are already scaffolds for security around the institute, in which 24-hour ashram security guards have been deployed
 or to or kisi bhi shaks ko bagaiyr talaashi ke ashram ke andar daakhil hone kii ijaajat nahin he
 But the condition then becomes more serious
 jab kanoon ke rakhwale yani pulisavaalon kii entry bhi ashram main bain kar di jaati he
 Now everyone fears that this matter may not get complicated like the Satlok Ashram of Sant Rampal
 dilip ko betaa maanane se inkarjis dilip kumaar jha kii arji par sunwaayee karte hue hoicourt ne ashutosh maharaj ke antim sanskaar ke liye punjab sarkaar ko 15 dinon kaa ultimatum diya he, usee dilip kumaar jha ke saath ashutosh maharaj ke rishton par ab bhi sawalia nishaan maujuud hai
 The court has refused to consider Dilip as Ashutosh Maharaj's son, while Puran Singh, the driver of Dilip and Maharaj, is preparing to file a fresh petition on the matter in a double bench of the High Court
 darasal, khud ko ashutosh maharaj kaa betaa bataate hue dilip kumaar jha ne hai court main jo arji di thi
 Hearing him, the court asked him to prove himself as the son of Maharaj
 is par dilip ne adaalat main apni taraf se kai dastavej or subut pesh kiye
 But the court turned them down
 aise main ab dilip kumaar jha maharaj or apana diene jaanch karwaanaa chaahate hai, taaki doodh kaa doodh or pani kaa pani ho sake
 However, at the moment it is clear that Maharaj was also originally from Nalkhor village of Madhubani in Bihar and his real name was Mahesh Kumar Jha
 ab dilip or puuran kii nai argiyon ke baad maamle kaa oont kis karavat baithegaa, ye dekhanevaali baat hogi

 america ke ek bauddhik santhaan kii nai report ke anusaar pratibandhit aatankwaadi sanghathan indian mujahidin pakistan se milane vaale sahyog ke kaaran zyada ghaatak he
 The report 'jihadist Violence: The Indian Threat' by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars underscores that the jihadi movement in India is an internal security issue involving an external dimension

 The report says, "external support is going to increase its strength more than a major driver for Indian insurgency
" iem ko lashkar-e-taiyaba se madad milti he, lekin use isi kaman or niyantran ke adheen nahin dekha janaa chahie
 This is what makes IM different from other let members and factions operating in India
 ' The report is based on research conducted over a period of 20 months from January 2012 to September 2013 and includes interviews conducted in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh
 report main kaha gaya he ki indian mujahidin bharat main sakriy islamic aatankwaadi sansthaaon ke bade sansar kaa hissaa he jiske adhiktar sanghathan bahari samoohon jaise lashkar-e-taiyaba or bangladesh ke harakat-ul-jihad-al-islam (huji-bi) se jude hue hai
 The report says that IM should not be seen as a formal organization, but rather as a relatively disorganized network of jihadist elements emanating from the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) and the criminal world
