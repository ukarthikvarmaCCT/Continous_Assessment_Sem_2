 pradhanmantri narendra modi centre or rajasthan sarkaar kii yojanaon kaa laabh uthaane vaale logon se milane ke liye shanivaar ko jaipur aa rahe hai
 Beneficiaries of about 1
25 lakh government schemes from across the state have come to Jaipur to communicate directly with Modi
 magar jo log bhi kaali pant, kaala dupatta, kaali rumal, kaali topi pahan kar aa gaye hai unhensabhaamein jane se roka ja rahaa he taaki kahin koi dharna pradarshan na shuru kar de
 People wearing black clothes are facing difficulty in Modi's meeting
 koi kaala rumal le liya he to koi kaala moja pahan liya he, koi kaala pant pahan liya he to koi kaali shart
 Someone has put a black muffler and a black scarf
 magar har kisi ke kaale kapade ko utaravaaya ja rahaa he
 Even the black vest of men has been removed
 muslim mahilaon ko lautayakala burka pahanakar aane vaali muslim mahilaon ko bhi lautnaa pad rahaa he
 Wherever metal detectors are installed, a mountain of black clothes has stood up

 Those who have come here from 300-400 km away and have come wearing black cloth are facing a lot of trouble
 vahiin afasaron kaa kahana he, 'sarkaar kaa nirdesh he, ham kuch nahin kar sakate hai
 Under no circumstances can anyone be allowed to go inside wearing a black cloth
 ' yahaan tak ki koi vyakti agar kaala bag lekar aayaa he to use baahar chhodana pad rahaa he varanaa use sabha chhodkar lautnaa pad rahaa he
 The administration is busy making sure that no one is able to show black goods at Prime Minister Modi's rally
 kyon itnaa satark he prashasanjhunjhunu main pradhanmantri kii sabha main kaale kapade laae jane kii ghatana ke baad se rajasthan sarkaar kaaphi satark he or kaala pahanane waalon ko kisi bhi surat main andar nahin jane diya ja rahaa he
 In fact, the last time PM Modi had a rally in Jhunjhunu, during this time such a situation was seen and people started protesting
 congress ne bataaya bhagwaan shani kaa apmaanaudhar congress kaa kahana he ki kaale se modi sarkaar ko itnaa nahin darana chahie
 Today is Saturday and not wearing black clothes is an insult to Lord Shani and according to Hindu customs, the insult of black on Saturday may outweigh the BJP

 It has been a long time when someone has given a warning to Sonia Gandhi and that person is left to say that the officer is a victim
 24 july ko sharad pavaar ne congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko ek saarvajanik sandesh bhejaah 24 ghante ke bheetar meri sabhi samasyaon kaa samaadhaan karen anyathaa main baahar ho jaaoongaa
 This changed from 24 hours of silence to 48 hours, after which the Congress used some ointment to appease Pawar's ego
 utana hi, jaise congress ke samrajya main kisi yaachak ko kuch mil jaae
 Sonia Gandhi and Sharad Pawar are partners in the UPA government for almost eight years
 rajeev gandhi jab indian airlines main mahaj ek payalat the tab pavaar maharashtra ke mukhyamantri the
 But Sonia Gandhi showed a disrespect towards him like an unwanted fellow
 sonia apni koi muskaraahat bhi pavaar par jaaya nahin karnaa chahengi
 The Congress President has neither forgotten nor forgiven his opposition
 pavaar ne 2004 main sonia ko pradhanmantri banane kaa virodh kiya tha
 Sonia's contact with the NCP has been through the more flexible Praful Patel
 unhone patel ke liye 2004 or 2009 main chunaav prachaar kiya tha
 Patel had the least lead in the assembly constituency in which he held meetings, but to be fair, he could get the same benefit because he took Sonia to the most difficult areas
 iske ulat pavaar ke dow
 The equation with Manmohan Singh has been excellent
 sonia aade na hotin to singh pavaar ko aisa koi vibhaag dete jo raajnneeti main unke baari kad ko dekhte hue upyukt rahata
 Pawar has also been an ardent supporter of sending Pranab Mukherjee to Rashtrapati Bhavan from which Sonia had reservations
 haalanki, iskaa yah matlab nahin ki ensipi main do dhade hai
 Patel is not the commander of a pro-clive faction of siraj-ud-daula's army
 ve apane netaa pavaar ke vafaadaar hai, jo sahyogiyon or shatruon, donon ke saath acchhee police / buree police kaa khel khelte hai
 Then what is Pawar's strategy? There are four stages of political rift
 pehla charan bhunbhunane kaa hota he
 This buzzing is heard, but nobody really cares about it because everyone knows that just a stomachache is not enough for a volcano to burst
 doosraa charan baghawat kaa hota he jisamen mol-tol kii gunjaaish bachi rahati he
 But there is a risk element added to it
 isamen shuruaati uddeshy asthir karne kaa nahin balki ashaant karne kaa hi hota he, lekin donon paksh yah jaanate hai ki itani zyada maang nahin kar sakate jisaki purti hi na ho paae
 The third phase is a low-intensity insurgency of combating the group
 maujuuda pariprekshya main ise is tarah se kah sakate hai ''congress ke iraadon main partner kaa adnga?'' antim charan talaak kaa hota he lekin iske liye astitv par chot karne laayak kaaran hona chahie
 Quarrel only creates distance, but it cannot be a sufficient basis for separation
 congress ke pramukh sahyogi dal ubaal kha rahe hai
 DMK is thundering
 paristhitiyon ne use apane hi gusse kaa asahaay kaidi bana diya he
 However humiliating this cage is for a regional party, it is better to go out into a terrible forest full of carnivorous cats
 apni bhunbhunaahat ko dabaakar rakhane vaale pavaar ne aisi baghawat ke saath saarvajanik abhiyaan shuru kar diya jo ki lagata he ki mol-tol ke liye hi tha
 Mamta Banerjee has reached the third stage of fury
 lekin pavaar or banerjee donon jaanate hai ki ve kis disha main bad rahe hai
 Pawar understands the danger of becoming useless like a cracker
 haalanki, unhone long turm kii koi yojana banaae bina yah daanv nahin chalaa hoga, aakhir unhen vah to milane se rahaa jo unki party ke log vastav main chaahate hai, mumbai main ek nayaa mukhyamantri
 Pawar admits that Prithviraj Chavan is the most honest Chief Minister of the Congress since 2004, but his administration is a failure
 ve iske liye chukaai jane vaali keemat main hissedaar nahin bananaa chaahate
 At the core of this dramatic script was: Governance and Accountability
 congress shasit rajyon kaa puri tarah se ladkadaa janaa jitna ascharyajanak he, utana gudh bhi
 Three years ago, Andhra Pradesh, Assam and Haryana were models of political honesty
 ve ab saamaajik hinsa or rajnatik asthirataa ke nabadan main tabdeel ho chuke hai
 Communal violence and riots are back in Assam, due to which the Congress won a historic victory and due to these, the Congress can now be punished like a historic defeat
 prakat taur par kuch nayaa na ho rahaa ho to kya hota he? aap apane vaahan or dimag par niyantran kho den to haadasa ho jaataa he
 One reason may be intoxication, the other is failure
 sahyogi dal stearing wheel se dur jane kii koshish kar rahe hai, jisko unhen kabhi-kabhi hi chune kii ijaajat di gai he, taaki kisi chattan ke saamne aane par ve gaadi ko ghumaakar dur le ja saken
 The news is not what is happening in Delhi, but rather dangerous and growing uproar is seen from outside the capital's door to the far-flung areas of the country
 bijepi bhi karnataka main traasadee kii ore bad rahi he or jabardast safalataa ke kuch hi maheenon ke bheetar mulaayam singh yadav upi waalon ko mayawati kii phir se yaad dilaane lage hai
 It is such a painful tightness that is taking over India

 Former Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan's uncle father-in-law Madan Lal Sharma's statement in front of the commission has put Chavan's wife Amita in the dock, not only for Ashok Chavan
 sharma ne kamishan ko bataaya, "chavaan ke patni amita ne unhen adarsh main flats dilwane ke liye unhen bogus rent racipt di thi

 5 people are his, whose emphasis is on us
 
 
 vaaki aamir khan par kisi kaa jor nahin he or isiilie har baar vah na sirf hamen chaunkaate hai, balki ummid se bhar jate hai
 Dhoom 3 is a tremendous film, to say it will be like running with words
 dhooma 3 aamir film he
 Yes, that sounds fine
 isamen sab kuch he, jisaki ummid aap is chuttee sijan ke dauraan kar sakate hai
 a stunt scene tied to a chair, a brainwashing script and whistling, kissing blows Aamir acting
 itane par hi baat nahin rukati
 Shocking at our acquired cine knowledge, the public laughs a lot even when Ali, Uday Chopra, is on the screen
 film kaa bas ek gaanaa aisa he, jo na bhi hota to fark nahin padataa
 The rest is such a boom, which will not surprise me if i do not start 300 crore club
 to meri salaah ye he ki rivyuu padhane ke fouran baad timming check kariye or haa, film ke bare main zyada padhie yaa discus mat kariye
 The secret will be killed
 dhooma 3 chicago kii kahani he
 Here is an Indian gentleman named Iqbal, who runs the Great Indian Circus
 sarkas badal rahaa he or ikbaal vittiya sankat main hai
 The bankers deny his magic and Iqbal is unable to withstand the shock
 sadam se paidaa hota he sabak
 To mix the Nirmohi Bank into the soil
 jimmaa uthaata he ikbaal kaa betaa, baharupia, hansod, kartababaj sahir
 Sahir not only steals money from the bank, but also loots his reputation to the extent of destruction
 or phir hindi main ek sandesh chhod detaa he
 Obviously if it is Hindi then the Indian Police will also come
 yaheen entry hoti he jai dikshit or ali kii
 This game of thief-soldier goes on and in the middle the circus's natini ie Aaliya also pours some embers of love in this dhoom
 is khel main koun jeetta he
 It can be fixed from the end
 par kya vaaki ant haar jeet kaa aakhri taraazoo hota he
 Not at all in this film
 bas itnaa yaad rakhie ki ant bhi film ke grand sikret kii tarah hi nayaa or taaja he
 Dhoom 3 is Aamir Khan's film
 puri kii puri
 Everyone else is a retailer, who stays in the front pocket of the wallet, and appears right there
 sahir ke vyaktitv ke doharaav ko unhone jis tarah se parde par jiya he
 Seeing him, it seems that when Aamir also does commercial cinema, he will make it classy
 jai dikshit ke role main abhishek bachchan hai to, magar ek cop kii jo killer eestil honi chahie, vah missing he
 But this is Dhoom and Jai Ali cannot be changed in this
 udai chopra ke hisse zyada footage yaa koi gaanaa nahin aayaa he
 It is not a relief vaise vah itane bhi bure nahin the ab tak
 Katrina Kaif's part was not much, apart from dance and moves and this sheila dance of cinema is good
 film ke gane malang-malang or kamali acchhee timming par aate hai or koreography bhi jabardast he
 Tu Hai Junoon is a romantic number and it is average
 dhooma kaa tital song aakhir main aata he or tab tak aap is film ke jaadui sammohan kii giraft main hote hai
 Some of the locations of the film are beautiful and exciting to the extent of shocking
 dhooma 3 jarur dekhie
 There will be fun, intoxication and heart will turn into malaise

 They order food and liquor
 jab 6,000 ru
 When the time comes to pay more than the bill, the celebration suddenly stops
 bhugtan karne ke mood main koi bhi nahin tha
 The 'best friend' yet men started attacking each other
 baar se baahar nikaale jane par unhone footpath par bhi jhagada jari rakhaa
 The quarrel caught the attention of Gaurav Jyoti Niog, reporter of Guwahati's channel 'news Live'
 channel kii maalik riniki bhuiyaan sarama hai, jo assam ke shiksha or swasthya mantri himant biswa sarama kii patni hai
 Himanta Biswa Sarma presents himself as the successor to three-time Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi
 iske baad us raat jo hua, usne agle saptaah bhar ke liye desh ko hilaa kar rakh diya
 a crowd of more than 20 men, among whom the rest were sanitation workers, drivers and attendants of a liquor shop under a restaurant, "on the charge of committing a nuisance among the public" at Reena and her entourage
 Attacked
 paanch dost to bheed kii pakad se bhaag nikle, lekin rina, jo bhaagane ke liye ek autoricshaw main baith rahi thi, 'pakadi' gai
 "two men grabbed me by the arm and pulled me out," Reena told India Today
 unhone mere bal khinche, meraa sharir tatola or mere kapade faad die
 One of them pulled out my bra and removed it
 jaise hi camera aayaa, or zyada log isamen shaamil ho gaye
 The harassers forcibly exposed not only my face, but also my body on camera
 ''uski pidaa yaheen khatm nahin hui
 He was once again humiliated by the police
 13 july ko guwahati ke tatkaaleen varisht police adheekshak (esaspi) apurb jivan barua ne ise ek chhitput ghatana bataaya
 Three days later Barua was removed from his post
 phir 14 july ko rashtriya mahila ayog dwaara ghatana kii jaanch ke liye niyukt teen-sadasyeey jaanch dal kii ek sadsy alka lamba ne peedit kaa naam ujagar kar diya
 Lamba was dropped from the team, but only after she submitted the report
 lamba ko sirf isi jaanch ke liye ayog ne niyukt kiya tha, aise main ve apana kaam puraa kar chuki hai or unhen hataae jane kaa vyaavhaarik arthon main koi matlab nahin he
 However, the Chairperson of the Commission Mamta Sharma does not agree with this
 mukhyamantri ek or badi galati kii maafee maangane ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 On 16 July, when the girl came to meet him, her press officials sent her photo with her name to all the media in Guwahati
 gogoi kehete hai, ''yah ek galati thi or ise main sweekaar karata hum
 There is no question of apology
 '' mukhyamantri ko isamen ek sajeesh kii gandh aa rahi he
 In a covert attack on ally-turned-rival Sarma, Gogoi said on July 17, "uploading the video to youtube was part of a conspiracy to humiliate me nationally
 ''gogoi or sarama ke bich tanaav kii khabaren april se hi garm hai
 In fact, Sarma secretly met Congress President Sonia Gandhi in Delhi and suggested Gogoi's name as the Congress Vice Presidential candidate, paving the way for him to become the Chief Minister of Assam himself
 maamla june ke ant main tab or kharaab ho gaya, jab pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne assam main baadh kii sthiti ke bare main poochtacha karne ke liye sidhe sarama ko bula liya, kyonki gogoi 10 din kii yatra par america gaye hue the
 Later Gogoi said, "maybe there is a super chief minister in the state, i don't care
" ''philhal gogoi kii koshish yah he ki police ke nikammepan se logon kaa dhyaan hat jaae or is sharmnaak cond ko tivi par dikhaane kii ghatana mukhya mudda ban jaae
 The video was uploaded on youtube on July 11 by Atanu Bhuiyan, editor-in-chief of News Live
 13 july ko kisi samay mukhyamantri ke dhur virdohi rahe artiai kaaryakarta akhil gogoi ne aarope lagaaya ki unke paas yah sabit karne vaali video clipings hai ki bheed ko reporter ne uksaaya tha
 He has handed over these steps to Assam's Director General of Police Jayanto Narayan Choudhary
 16 july ko tarun gogoi ne tippanee kii ki ''jab is chhedchhad kii shooting karke video banaaya ja rahaa tha, tab niog patrakarita nahin kar rahe the
 a day earlier, his son Gaurav wrote in the Twitter account of North East Blog
in, "when will you publish the results of your survey if you blame News Live journalist in Guwahati incident?" Resigned saying that "the Chief Minister has already made up his mind that Niog is guilty
" main ek nishpaksh jaanch kii ummid kaise kar saktaa hum?'' tab tak assam sarkaar kii saakh ko nuksaan ho chukaa tha
 On July 13, a national news channel broadcast the video of the molestation and outrage spread across the country
 ek gaiyr sarkari sanghathan-assam public works ne guwahati main 15 aparaadhiyon main se chah ke poster laga die
 a picture of 33-year-old Amar Jyoti Kalita, a local actor and former employee of the Assam Electronics Development Corporation, the leader of the girl's abusers, was widely circulated on social networking sites with the tag, "I am one of the teenage children
" i am a tyrant kri payaa is tasviir ko share karke mujhe favmas bana dijie
 The national coverage showed the Tarun Gogoi administration as clumsy
 gogoi ne 13 july ko assam police ko sabhi aropiyon ko giraftaar karne ke liye 48 ghante kii samay seemaa di
 On 15 July he let the fact be revealed that Amar Jyoti Kalita had been traced to Odisha
 mukhya abhiyukt abhi bhi faraar tha or ku thit tarun gogoi ne 16 july ko ek vishesh jaanch dal gathit kar diya
 The same day SSP Barua of Guwahati was transferred to Dibrugarh and SP Arbind Kalita of Dibrugarh was brought to Guwahati
 agali subah yah aadesh radd kar diya gaya or barua se kaha gaya ki vah shonitpur ke espi anand tiwari ke saath apane-apane padon kii adla-badali kar len
 reason? Aurobindo Kalita is believed to be more than loyal to Sarma
 ek cabinet mantri kehete hai, ''assam congress ke liye sabase surakshit rajyon main se ek rahaa he
 The incident exposes Gogoi's incompetence, which was still hidden in the efficient management of Himanta
 yadi in donon main sulah nahin hoti he, to congress rajya main bikhar jaaegi
 “this molestation scandal also exposed the extent to which constitutional bodies such as the National Commission for Women have lost their edge due to political appointments
 haalanki congress ke chaatr sanghathan enesuai kii ek purv rashtriya adhyaksh alka lamba rashtriya mahila ayog kii sadsy tak nahin thim, lekin unhen tabadatod dhang se jaanch dal kii sadsy ke taur par bheja gaya tha
 There are reports that she was in constant touch with some leaders of Assam Youth Congress since landing in Guwahati
 khud bhi congress kii netaa or rashtriya mahila ayog kii adhyaksh mamata sharma jaanch dal ke gathan ke bare main kahati hai, ''agar maamla kisi takneekee-kanoonee prakriya se sambandhit nahin hota he, to ham aam taur par kisi saamaajik kaaryakarta ko niyukt karte hai
 Poor victim Reena now wants to stay away from both media and politicians
 usne assam police awaas colony se baahar, uloobery main apana ghar chhod diya he
 She told India Today, "why am i forced to give details of the incident i want to forget?" i am tired of crying
 main ab shanti chaahati hum

Kumbh Mela Quiz 15: Which one rules should be followed by those observing fast on the day of Mauni Amavasya? Kumbh 2019 Photos: These famous 11 places are present near Kumbh Mela, then go around, Surendpandit told a solution to prevent this defect 
 unhone bataaya ki kanya alag soma (dhobin) kaa pujan karegi to yah dosha dur ho jayega
 Gunvati has to please Soma with his service
 ye upaay jaan brahman ne apane chote putr or putree ko soma ko lene bheja
 Soma lived on the Sinhala island across the ocean
 chota putr sagar paar karne kii chintaa main ek ped kii chaaya ke neeche baith gaya
 The vulture's family lived on that tree
 shaam hote hi giddh ke bacchon kii maa apane ghosle main waapas ai to use pataa chalaa ki uske giddh bacchon ne bhojan nahin kiya
 The vulture's children said to their mother that two beings have been sitting hungry and thirsty since morning
 jab tak wo kuch nahin kha lete, tab tak ham bhi kuch nahin khaaenge
 Hearing this, the mother of vultures went to that two creatures and said - i have come to know your wish
 main aapako subah sagar paar kara duungi
 But before that eat something, i bring you food
 donon bhai-bahan ko alge din subah giddh ne sagar paar karaayaa
 Both reached Soma's house and started serving her without telling anything
 uskaa ghar lipane lage
 Soma one day asked his daughters-in-law who dumps our house every morning
 Everyone said that no one, we are the one who leaves the house
 lekin soma ko apane parivaar waalon kii baton kaa bharosa nahi hua
 One night she woke up in the morning to find out the secret and she found out that these brothers and sisters plunge her house
 soma ne donon se baat kii or donon ne soma ko bahan ke dosha or nivaaran kii baat bataai
 Soma pledged to Gunvati to get rid of that defect, but Gunvati's brother urged him to come home
 soma ne naa nahin kiya wo donon ke saath brahman ke ghar pahunchi
 Soma told her daughters-in-law that if someone dies in her absence, do not destroy her body, wait for me
 ye bolkar wo gunavati ke saath uske ghar chai gai
 The program of marriage of quality was decided
 lekin saptapadi hote hi uskaa pati mar gaya
 Soma immediately gave the fruits of his virtues to the quality
 uskaa pati turant jivit ho gaya
 Soma left both of them with gratitude
 gunavati ko punya-fal dene se soma ke putr, jamaata or pati kii mrityu ho gai
 Soma worshiped Vishnu in the shadow of Peepal on the way to accumulate the virtuous fruit and performed 108 parikramas and kept a fast
 parikrama purna hote hi uske parivaar ke mritak jan jivit ho uthe
 He got the fruit of service with impeccable spirit

 Four days before polling in the Bundelkhand region, BJP MP from Jhansi and Union Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti have again raised the demand for a separate Bundelkhand state
 enditivi se baatcheet main uma bharti ne kaha ki vah 40 saal se ek alag bundelkhand rajya kaa samarthan karti rahi hai
 And now people demanding a separate Bundelkhand state should start the process of creating a proposed Bundelkhand state
 2014 ke chunaavon ke dauraan uma bharti ne yah aashwaasan diya tha ki bijepi ke satta main aane ke chah maheene ke bheetar ek alag bundelkhand rajya banane kii prakriya shuru kii jaaegi, lekin is par ab tak pahal nahin hui he
 In an exclusive conversation with NDTV, Uma Bharti has sparked a debate on the issue by demanding a separate Bundelkhand state just before voting in the Bundelkhand region
 shanivaar ko jhaansi main apni sabha main bispi supremeo ne bhi is mudde ko jorshor se uthaa diya
 Mayawati said in her election meeting, 'when a separate Bundelkhand state is not formed then, the BSP will keep raising this demand, we will pressurize the central government
 ' tippaniyan On the other hand, the Congress is alleging that Uma Bharti has been in power in Delhi for almost 3 years but the Modi government did nothing on it
 jhaansi nagar se congress-sapa ke saajha pratyaashee rahul raay kehete hai, 'ye ek raajnneetik jumala he
 In the 2014 elections, Uma Bharti had said that if BJP came to power, she would start the process of formation of a separate Bundelkhand state but nothing happened
 is baar phir chunaav se pehle ise uthaaya ja rahaa he
 ' udhar ilaake main chunaavon se pehle ek alag bundelkhand rajya kii maang ko lekar logon main phir ummid bandhi he
 In fact, the demand for a separate Bundelkhand state in this most backward area of UP has been arising for the last several decades
 is baar phir chunaavon ke dauraan ye ek raajnneetik mudda ban gaya he
 Now it has to be seen whether this time the matter can move forward or not
 NDTV se exclusive baatcheet main uma bharti ne bundelkhand ilaake main voting se thik pehle ek alag bundelkhand rajya kii maang kar is mudde par bahes ched di he
 The BSP supremo also raised the issue vigorously in his meeting in Jhansi on Saturday
 mayawati ne apni chunavi sabha main kaha, 'jab tab ek alag bundelkhand rajya nahin ban jaataa, bispi ye maang uthaati rahegi, ham centre sarkaar par dabaav banaaenge
 Comments udhar congress ye aarope laga rahi he uma bharti dilli main satta main kareeb 3 saal se hai lekin modi sarkaar ne is par kuch nahin kiya
 Rahul Rai, a congress-sp joint candidate from Jhansi Nagar, says, “this is a political jumla
 2014 ke chunaav main uma bharti ne kaha tha ki agar bijepi satta main ai to wo ek alag bundelkhand rajya ke gathan kii prakriya shuru karengi lekin kuch nahin hua
 This is being raised again before the election
 ' On the other hand, before the elections in the area, there is a hope among the people about the demand for a separate Bundelkhand state
 darasal upi ke is sabase pichde ilaake main ek alag bundelkhand rajya kii maang pichley kai dashakon se uthati rahi he
 This has again become a political issue during elections
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki kya is baar is mudde par baat aage bad paati he yaa nahin
 Mayawati said in her election meeting, 'when a separate Bundelkhand state is not formed then, the BSP will keep raising this demand, we will pressurize the central government
 ' tippaniyan On the other hand, the Congress is alleging that Uma Bharti has been in power in Delhi for almost 3 years but the Modi government did nothing on it

 8 on PF from Ministry of Labor
 80 fisadi byaaj dar die jane kii sifarish kii gai thi, jise vitt mantralay ne sweekaar nahin kiya
 Employees' organizations announced the demonstration from April 27, the employee organizations of NCBT have appealed to the Ministry of Labor to recommend it to the Finance Ministry for reconsideration
 sanghathanon ne is faisle ke khilaaf 27 april se pradarshan karne kii baat kahi he
 Brijesh Upadhyay, national secretary of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) and a member of the CBT, said that the epf's money is not of the government but of the employee
 karmchaaree sanghathanon ne jataayaa sakht virohaul india trade union ke mahasachiv or sibiti sadsy di el sachdeva ne kaha ki vitt mantralay kaa yah faisla kisi bhi tarah manjuur karne laayak nahin he
 He said that we were with the recommendations of the Ministry of Labor, but this decision is shocking
 vahiin centre of trade unions (situ) ke adhyaksh or sibiti sadsy e ke padmanabhan ne kaha ki yah centre sarkaar kii is niti ke bare main sibiti ko pehle bataaya tak nahin gaya
 It is condemnable and worth rejecting

 It should have been first introduced for discussion in CBT before the verdict

 Prior to this, the protest of employees across the country continues to be taxed on EPF withdrawal

 It was decided to pay 80 per cent interest which was also opposed by the members of the trustees at that time
 trustee board ke sadasyon ne ipief ko hui aamadani ke anusaar 8
 95 percent interest was demanded, but the board could not reach a consensus
 EPFO main byaaj dar kam kii gaichhoti bajet skiimon kii byaaj daron main katautee ke baad sarkaar ne ab pief par milane vaale byaaj daron main katautee kar di he
 Finance Ministry proposed interest rate 8 on PF for the year 2015-16

 With this decision of the Ministry of Labor, the benefits that the employees could get for the year 2015-16 will no longer be available

 This money belongs to the employees whose salary deducts PF money every month

 Who will benefit from this? If 8 from the Ministry of Labor
 70 fisadi byaaj dar kii ghoshnaa se un bade gharaanon ke pief treston ko phayda hoga jo wo khud sanchalit karte hai
 If 8 on EPFO PF

 Rohit Philip resigned from the post, Aditya Pandey will handle the controversy of the promoters of Indigo in the discussion, Rohit Philip has resigned as the Chief Financial Officer of interglobe Aviation
 ab unki jagah aditya pandeya sanbhaalenge
 Aditya Pandey will take charge on 16 September
 interglobe aviation kii upashakha desh kii sabase badi airline indigo he
 According to media reports, Rohit Philip has resigned because there was tension between the two promoters of the company over something
 indigo ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari ronajoy datta ne kaha ki aditya kaa company main shaamil hone kaa faisla swaagat yogya he
 The dispute between the promoters of indigo, the country's largest airline, was recently discussed
 iske ek pramotor rakesh gangwal ne company ke nideshak mandal ko sakht shabdon main ek letters likhakar is baat ko sire se khaarij kiya tha ki unke or duusare pramotor rahul bhaatia ke bich kaa vivaad sulajh gaya he
 Gangwal had said that due to several 'serious unresolved issues' he would not vote in support of a special resolution to 'change the Articles of Association'
 indigo kii ore se jari soochna5 agast ke apane letters main gangwal ne kaha tha ki agm ko yah bataanaa chahenge ki agyaat sroton ke hawaale se press main yah khabar plant kii ja rahi he ki chairman ne mail-milaap kar liya he or yah masalaa sulajh gaya he
 Such a misleading and inaccurate image is being presented that both the RPT and the changes in articles have the support of both promoter groups
 unke dwaara 20 july ko bheje gaye tamaam mail ke yah bilkul vipareet baat he, jisamen unhone apana paksh saaf kar diya tha
 Indigo's parent company Interglobe Aviation shares fell after this letter surfaced
 gangwal ne saaf kiya he ki vah tabhi vot karenge jab board ek poorak prastaav pesh kar bhaatia ke interglobe enterprijej group ko zyada adhikaar or kshamta hasil karne se roke
 Significantly, there have been reports of serious differences between the two founders of indigo, the country's largest airline
 do sansthaapakon rahul bhaatia or rakesh gangwal ke bich airlines kii ranneetiyon or mahatvakankshaon ko lekar matbhed hai
 The differences between the two promoters have intensified since the announcement of the resignation of airline CEO Aditya Ghosh in April last year and the appointment of foreigners to several top positions
 indigo desh hi nahin, duniya kii sabase teji se badhane vaali airlines main se he or iske peeche mukhya force america aviation industry main kaam kar chuke rakesh gangwal ko mana jaataa he
 It is because of Gangwal that indigo has placed a record number of aircraft orders and is aggressively expanding its operations in India
 daagi saansadon or vidhayakon ko bachaane ke liye sarkaar ne ek nayaa pintara apanaaya he
 Until the final verdict is reached on a tainted MP or MLA, they will not be prevented from representing the public
 sarkaar ne cabinet main bada faisla karte hue janpratinidhitiv kanoon main sanshodhan ko manjuuri de di he
 This exercise of the cabinet has been to change the decision of the Supreme Court, which was ordered to take away the membership of the MP or MLA as soon as the punishment of two years or more
 ab agar kisi ko sajaa hoti bhi he ki to upree court main maamla lambit rahane tak sambandhit saansad yaa vidhayak sadsy bane rahenge, haalanki unhen bhatta nahin milegaa or voting kaa adhikaar nahin hoga
 Similarly, in the second amendment, it has been said that if a person is in police custody, he will remain a voter, that is, he can contest elections
 patna hai court ne apane ek faisle main kaha tha ki agar wo jail main he to matadaata nahin bana rah saktaa he
 Mahatma Gandhi had emphasized that the sanctity of Parliament should remain, but it seems more important to run and save the government

 There are more than 151 Bills pending in Parliament at this time, but the Government is not showing any haggle on it, but when the turn of the gang comes to taint the leaders, all the parties are united
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 (lok Sabha Polls 2019)main dilli kii saaton seat par jeet kii aas lagaai bijepi purvi dilli kii seat ko lekar pareshaan najar aa rahi he
 Upset over the 'poor' management of the election campaign of his 'celebrity' candidate Gautam Gambhir from East Delhi, the BJP leadership has tasked party vice-president Shyam Jaju to reinforce the former cricketer's debut in politics
 bijepi ko aisa lag rahaa he ki gautam gambhir ko raajnneetik prabandhan main majbootee dene kii jarurat he, tabhi vah is seat ko nikaal paaenge
 a top Bharatiya Janata Party leader said that new serious bets are learning in politics but he is more dependent on the support being received from local BJP leaders for his campaign and the support of local leaders is also not predictable
 unhone kaha, ‘jaju ko gambhir kaa chunaav prachaar abhiyaan chalaane ke liye tainaat kiya gaya he
 
 
 He took over with immediate effect by holding meetings with local party leaders and making some changes in the media team of the East Delhi candidate
 'jaju party kii dilli ikai ke prabharee hai

 jammu-kashmir main vidhansabha chunaav se pehle vidhansabha siton ke parisemen kaa mudda ek baar phir jor pakad chukaa he
 Home Minister Amit Shah held a high-level meeting on this issue on Tuesday
 jammu-kashmir bijepi ke adhyaksh rabindra raina ne parisemen kaa samarthan kiya he or kahaan he ki jammu rigen aabaadi or kshetra main kashmir se bada he baavjood yahaan se chune jane vaale vidhayakon kii sankhya kam he
 Ravindra Raina said that when Jammu and Kashmir seats were increased in the 1960s, Farooq Abdullah and Congress conspired with Jammu
 rabindra raina ne kaha ki jammu or ladakh kaa aria bada he, lekin jaan boojhkar yahaan kii siten kam kii gayi, taaki jammu-kashmir main jo sarkaar bane usamen jammu or ladakh kaa zyada dakhal na rahe
 Ravindra Raina said that there has been a conflict in Jammu and Kashmir in the last 40 years and people have demanded that the seats in the three regions of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh be equalized
 raina ne maang uthaai or kaha ki jammu ke logon ke saath insaaf kii jaae
 He said that a letter was written to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir on his behalf and demanded that the seats in Jammu and Ladakh areas be increased by delimiting before the assembly elections
 rabindra raina ne kaha ki parisemen ke baad jammu-kashmir main jo sarkaar banegi wo janata kii sarkaar banegi varna congress or neshnal congress ne jammu ke saath hameshaa pakshpaat kiya he
 He has demanded the Central Government to set up a Delimitation Committee immediately
 bataa den ki jammu-kashmir main isse pehle 1995 main parisemen kiya gaya tha
 When 87 seats in Jammu and Kashmir were delimited on the orders of Governor Jagmohan
 jammu-kashmir main vidhansabha kii kul 111 siten hai, inamen se 24 siten paak adhikrut kashmir ke liye khaali chodi gai he
 In this way, only 87 seats are elected here
 jammu-kashmir kaa samvidhan kahata he ki har 10 saal baad siton kaa parisemen kiya jaae or jansankhya ke pattern main hue badlaav kaa dhyaan rakhaa jaae
 According to this law, there should have been delimitation of seats in Jammu and Kashmir in the year 2005 after 1995, but in 2002 the Farooq Abdullah government changed the law and banned it till 2026

 Some of these questions are as follows: - Those who love the country and want to serve the society, only those who are elected, what should be the criteria for the selection of such candidates? - If a wrong or corrupt person gets elected So what should be done and how to stop it? - What happens to those who become corrupt after the election? - Our aim in becoming a political alternative is to change the system and not the rules

 Significantly, in the Augusta case, middleman Christian Mitchell was sent to judicial custody by a Delhi court till 26 February

 PM Modi had said in the rally that a Rajdar has come from abroad, which is under the grip of agencies

 Let me tell you that the ED had claimed that during the interrogation, Christian Michel took the name of Mrs Gandhi
 haalanki ED ne ye saaf nahin kiya tha ki mishael ne kis sandarbh main misses gandhi kaa naam liya
 Apart from this, Michelle used many words like Italian Lady, R

 This was the culmination of appearances, because we already have the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan, which they completely overpowered, and thus simply stuck the saffron label on the old Congress bottle
 haa, yah sahi he ki nirmal bharat abhiyaan se pehle varsh 1999 main atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar ne sampurna safai abhiyaan chalaaya tha, lekin hamaare modi ji apni hi party ke purvavarti ke kaaryakramon ko hadapney main bhi ek pal nahin hichakate
 Such usurping of programs can also be tolerated, provided that Modi ji at least thinks about the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan and the entire cleanliness campaign and the tireless hard work behind the implementation and implementation of the shortcomings in them in the past Study what improvements have to be made to achieve their objectives
 ha, unke paas is tarah inke vistaar main jane kaa samay hi nahin he

 SQUAT is broadly named - Sanitation Quality, Use, Access and Trends (level of cleanliness, usage, access and customary methods), and the survey was conducted by the New Delhi-based Research Institute for Compassionate Economics, and two of its young researchers - Ashish Gupta And Payal Hathi - published their findings in an article in 'the Indian Express' the very day after the launch of Modi ji's program

 They found that more than half of the mothers with whom they interacted are not even ready to believe that the use of closed toilets inside the home for the health of their children, compared to going to the open defecation Is more secure
 unhone yah bhi paaya ki jin gharon main shauchalay bane bhi hai, unamem bhi parivaar kaa kam se kam ek sadsy ab bhi baahar khule main shouch ke liye janaa pasand karata he
 This is the thinking and ignorance, which we must overcome rightfully with patience

 vah zikr karte hai urisa main bhubaneshwar se lekar kandhamal tak sadak maarg se kii gai apni ek yatra kaa, jiske dauraan unhone saikadon graminon ko sadak ke kinare baithkar nivrutt hote dekha
 Raghunandan questioned an official of the Orissa government, who was constantly reporting the number of toilets that the government has built, how many are planned to be built, and how many are being built, why these people Thousands are not using toilets that have been built
 adhikari kaa jawaab tha, "logon kaa maananaa he ki ghar ke bheetar shouch se nivrutt hone se shuddhta khatm ho jaati he, kyonki unke mutabik gharon main bhagwaan kaa vaas hota he
 
 
 "raghunandan sarcastically says," It is quite clear that the shadow of God has risen from the streets built by the government
 
 
 " This is the thinking that we have to change - village by village, house by house, across seven lakh villages, and in millions of uncultivated slums in cities

 For this we need a whole army of 'clean servants', who also get good pay, and good equipment, who go to every village every morning, and under the supervision of the Panchayat Sanitation Committee and the local gram sabha, make sure that' heaps of human filth 'clean every day
 gandhi jayanti kaa din hone ke baavjood gaanvon main swatchta sunishchit karne main panchayaton kii ahm bhoomika ke bare main gandhi kii soch ko lekar modi ke paas kehane ke liye kuch bhi nahin tha
 Despite the responsibility of maintaining 'cleanliness' in the constitution to the gram panchayats and municipalities, the local governments were completely ignored
 iske alaava ek visheshgy cameti ne meri adhyakshata main pichley saal jo 1,500 prishth kii report daakhil kii thi, usamen maujuud model activity map tathaa budhimaani-bhare tareeke se shodh karne ke baad kiya gaya samasyaon kaa vishleshan bhi darkinar kar diya gaya

 When i went out for a walk this morning, none of the three people showed up, but poor Pappu was still there as usual, sweeping the street, and cleaning up the garbage, which won the BJP ticket

 a big campaign should have started on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, to ensure that Safai sevaks and Safai Karamcharis in cities and villages get good salaries, good allowances, and schemes for their welfare, so that their profession is respected Can be made, and thus the public can be associated with them

 Worse, private companies are not obliged to implement reservation in jobs, so outsourcing this job to private companies takes away the mouth of millions of entitlements to get jobs under quota
 gandhi jayanti ko arthpurna banaaya ja saktaa tha, yadi ise safai karmchaaree diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa, or dilli, mumbai, kolkata or chennai jaise sabase unnat shaharon main bhi sabase gande halaat main kaam karne ke liye majaboor sabase nichle str ke safai karmchaaree kii dasha par khaas dhyaan diya jaataa

 Praising Islam for its message of peace and harmony, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that none of the 99 names of Allah mean violence and emphasized that the fight against terrorism is not a confrontation against any religion and Terror and religion should be separated

 ’’ pradhanmantri ne kaha, ‘‘yah aisi ladaai he jise hamen mulyon kii takat or dharm ke vaastavik sandesh ke madhyam se jeetna hoga

 ab mana ja rahaa he ki yogi sarkaar apane is invester summit ko desh or duniya main bade tareeke se shokes kar paaegi
 Soon after the roadshow in Mumbai, the entire focus of Yogi Sarkar is focused on making the Investors Summit program a success
 bataa den ki summit shuru hone se pehle hi sarkaar ko inwestors summit ke liye karodon rupee ke nivesh ke prastaav mil gaye hai
 Earlier, the government also received 1 road show in Mumbai
 25 lakh karod rupee ke nivesh kaa prastaav mila he
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also attended this road show
 unhone mukesh ambani or ratan tata samet kai bade udyogpatiyon or bankers se mulaakaat kii thi
 Yogi Adityanath has met Ratan Tata, Mukesh Ambani as well as Adani Mahindra and all big industrialists of Godrej Group
 vahiin, 9 janvari ko kumaar mangalam birla yogi adityanath se mulaakaat karne lakhanu aa rahe hai
 Special preparations for the summit: After getting the green signal from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, preparations for Investors Summit are now in full swing
 21-22 farvari ko hone vaali is summit ke liye lakhanu ko khaastaur se taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Investments worth crores have been set
 The government has targeted to sign an mou on the investment proposal of one lakh crore in this summit
 isamen desh ke pramukh udyogpatiyon ke saath-saath duniya bhar se udyogpatiyon ko invester summit main aane kaa nyotaa diya gaya he
 The Yogi government wants to meet the investment target before the summit, so that a big goal can be shown to the Prime Minister
 lagaataar chah maichon main haar ke baavjood dilli dairedevills ke captain mahela jayavardhane ne khilaadiyon ko sakaaratmak bane rahane kii salaah dete hue kaha ki ab yah dikhaane kaa samay aa gaya he ki unki team vastav main acchhee he
 Delhi were defeated by Chennai Super Kings by 86 runs yesterday, their sixth consecutive defeat
 dairedevills ipel kii pehali team ban gai he, jisane kisi ek toornament main pehle chah match ganvaae hai
 Jayawardene said, "if we don't believe in ourselves, then there is no point in staying in the tournament
" hamen khud par yah vishwaas karne kii jarurat he ki ham vaapasi kar sakate hai
 Each winning is not just our team's points
 yadi ham do teen match jeet jate hai to kuch sthaan aage bad jaaenge
 We now have to show that our team is good
 unhone kaha, hamane ab tak keval do maichon main acha pradarshan nahin kiya
 We did not do well against Mumbai Indians here in Mumbai and here (against Chennai), but in other matches we did not give up till the end and we had opportunities
 jayavardhane ne kaha, hamen ab tak kam se kam do match jeetne chahie the, lekin ham sahi tarah se ant nahin kar paae
 In this type of tournament, if there is no consistency in your performance then it needs to be worked on
 isliye ab prayek ko apni jimmedaari samajni hogi
 Jayawardene refused to believe that the team was missing Kevin Pietersen or that Virender Sehwag's poor performance overshadowed the team
 unhone kaha, capi pehla insaan hoga, jo yah sweekaar karegaa ki yah keval ek khilaadi ke kaaran nahin he
 Last year we got off to a good start and every player was in form, which helped us dominate
 jayavardhane ne kaha, iskaa kaaran keval viru bhi nahin he
 Our problems cannot be diagnosed only by their being
 hamen ballebaaji main nirantar acha pradarshan karne kii jarurat he tathaa tii-20 main chotii ke chaar yaa paanch ballebaaj adhiktar over khelte hai
 We also talked about it, but unfortunately could not implement it
 tippaniyan This makes a difference in T20 matches
 is srilankai khilaadi se jab poocha gaya ki kya bharat ke gharelu khilaadiyon kaa acha pradarshan nahin kar paanaa team par baari pad rahaa he, unhone kaha, main samajhataa hum ki hamaare paas kuch achche khilaadi hai
 Unmukt (chand) has done well for the Indian Under-19 team and Delhi
 manpreet (juneja) or kedaar (jadhav) bhi acchhee ballebaaji kar rahe hai
 It is easy to find weaknesses when the team is losing
 yah balle or gend ke bich kii jang he, jise ham nahin jeet paa rahe hai
 Delhi team slumped to 83 against Chennai
 jayavardhane ne kaha, is wicket par 160-170 ran kaa score acha tha, kyonki outfield kaaphi tej thi
 We needed to start well and put pressure on them like we did in the last match after the 16th over, but we lost too many wickets in the beginning
 dilli ko kal yahaan chennai superkings ne 86 ran se karaari shikast di, jo uski lagaataar chhathi haar he
 The Daredevils became the first team in the IPL to have lost the first six matches in a single tournament
 jayavardhane ne kaha, yadi ham khud par vishwaas nahin kar pate to phir toornament main bane rahane kaa koi matlab nahin he
 We need to believe in ourselves that we can make a comeback
 prayek jeet rahaa he keval hamaari team ke ank nahin hai
 If we win two or three matches, some places will move forward
 hamen ab yah dikhaanaa hoga ki hamaari team acchhee he
 "we have not done well in only two matches so far," he said
 mumbai indians ke khilaaf mumbai or yahaan (chennai ke khilaaf) hamane acha pradarshan nahin kiya, lekin anya maichon main hamane aakhir tak haar nahin maani or hamaare paas avasar the
 Jayawardene said, "we should have won at least two matches so far, but we could not end well
" is tarah ke toornament main yadi aapke pradarshan main nirantarata nahin he to is par kaam karne kii jarurat hoti he
 So now everyone has to understand their responsibility
 jayavardhane ne yah baat maanane se inkaar kar diya ki team ko kevin petersan kii kami khal rahi he yaa virendra sahvaag kaa kharaab pradarshan team par baari pad rahaa he
 He said, KP will be the first person to accept that it is not due to just one player
 pichley saal hamane acchhee shuruyaat kii or prayek khilaadi farm main tha, jisase hamen dabadabaa banane main madad mili
 Jayawardene said, Veeru is not the only reason for this
 keval unke hone se hamaari pareshaaniyon kaa nidaan nahin ho saktaa
 We need to consistently do well in batting and the top four or five batsmen in T20s mostly play overs
 hamane is par baat bhi kii, lekin durbhaagya se ise lagu nahin kar paae
 The comments tii-20 maichon main isi se antar paidaa hota he
 The Sri Lankan player, when asked if the domestic players of India were not able to perform well, overshadowed the team, he said, "I think we have some good players
" unmukt (chand) ne bhartiya under 19 team or dilli kii taraf se acha pradarshan kiya he
 Manpreet (juneja) and Kedar (jadhav) are also batting well
 jab team haar rahi ho to kamajoriyaan nikaalnaa aasaan hota he

 aise hi kuch yaadon ko khud main samete hue he kitaab ‘jindagi aais paais'
 Nikhil Sachan's new book 'zindagi Ice Piece', which became popular with his first book Salt Taste-wise, is going to release on 25 May 2015
 philhal kitaab kii pribooking chaalu he
 Read further excerpts from the book 'zindagi Ice Piece'
 ye ek fundamentlist skool tha
 Here, whenever Dubey Math taught some 'intense' on the course of love according to Saab course, he always used to say that the lines presented are telling the union of soul and God
 lafj chaahe jitne bhi nagn hon, ughaare hon or pannon kii sej par apane priyatam ko chuum lene kii haraarat main bekaraar kasmasaa rahe hon, lekin laundon ko hameshaa yahi bargalaaya jaataa tha ki prastut panktiyon main 'aatma' chaahati he ki wo tuutakar-bikharakar 'paramatma' main samaa jaae
 Let us be at one
 bas, 'ultimetali' use jivan-maran ke chakkar se mukti mil jaae
 In such a situation, there were two types of children in the class
 ek wo, jo apni tinejri kii dahalij par ukaduun baithe apane sapanom kii shwet murgiyon ko pranay-bang de rahe hote the or khub samaj rahe hote the ki 'mari’ aatma ko aisi koun-si aag lagi padi he jo jab dekho paramatma kii baahon main samaane ko pagalaai rahati he
 The soul which cannot be wet with water nor can burn with fire, what hour will it do! The other kind of children used to be those who were really praying with folded hands, praying that the soul and the divine The union should somehow be settled
 wo 'dilavaale dulhaniya le jaaenge' ke train vaale aakhri seen kii vivechna bhi isi tarah karte ki yahaan par amrish puri 'sansar kii maaya' kaa pratik he or kaajol 'aatma' kaa praturup
 Ho-na-ho Shahrukh is the 'supreme Soul'
 film ke aakhri seen main jab amrish puri kaajol kaa haath chhod kahata he, 'ja simran, ji le apni jindagi
 Then it was clear that he was sending the soul to meet the divine through the supernatural-non-worldly journey of the train, by ridding Maya
 ye duusari tarah ke bachche bade bhole the
 But Dubey was always torn from the first kind of children
 kyonki gaahe-bagaahe unamem se koi-na-koi khadaa hokar puch hi detaa tha
 "math Saab, what sweet-sweet pain is he talking about through the poet's soul in the words presented
 maane dard to thik baat he maath saab, lekin ye koun prakaar kaa dard he jo meetha-meetha-sa lagata he?'doobe ji bhi khub bhale maanas the
 Used to answer the children's curiosity a lot
 misaal ke taur par, is sawaal ke jawaab main unhone neem kii pandrah bent vinod ke pichhawaade par sont-sont ke maari or kaha, "ab ye jo tumhaare pichhawaade par ho rahaa he na, yahi wo meetha-meetha dard he
 Which happens to the soul often
 ab to samaj paa rahe ho na betaa binod?"vinod hamaari class ke sabase haramkhor ladakon main se ek tha
 That's why i accepted him as my mentor
 mere liye vinod ummid kii wo kiran tha jo mujhe ‘duusari tarah’ ke bachche se ‘pehali tarah’ ke bachche main tabdeel kar saktaa tha
 i wanted to be the first type of child because i fell in love and i did not want my love to be a soul-divine nonsense love
 ham sab jaanate the ki vinod puri class main akelaa aisa ladkaa tha jiske paas garlfriend thi
 However, Vinod preferred to call it item, punti or mal
 lekin mujhe aisa kahana bilkul pasand nahin tha
 Because i do not want Shruti to be my girlfriend tomorrow and someone will call her Mal
 maine pehle se tay kar liya tha ki main use ‘janu’ kahuunga
 i used to practice calling Shruti Janu in my imagination in a boring period of geography
 or itnaa soch bhar lene se mere chehre kaa maanchitr badalane lagata
 i would be thrilled to think that if Shruti turned around and called me Janu, then the damp westerly sound of her voice would hit the dry desert of my body, bringing the first monsoon of the season
 vahaan, jahaan aaj tak barish kii ek boond bhi nahin giri, aaj vahaan musaladhar barsaat aegi or mere badan ke marusthal kaa rome-rome cherrapunji ke ghasiyaale maidaanon kii hari doob-sa khil uthegaa
 Shruti also had a stubbornness
 wo harek period main mere dimag kaa hissaa ho leti
 Like she is trying to tell me why i do not reach her and talk to her
 us din to had hi ho gai jab bhugol kii class ke baad angreji kii class main shruti lusi grey banakar aa gai
 Lucy's portrayal of each and every line of William Wordsworth's poem resembled Shruti
 
 After English, co-ordinate geometry was taught that day in a mathematics class
 shruti vahaan bhi thi
 In the rise and rise of parabola and ellipse
 vahaan main bhi tha
 By being asymptote
 treepathi maath sa'ba ne bataaya ki acimptot wo line hoti he jo parabola ko anant par jaakar milti he
 My heartbeats became sudden and rapid
 mujhase rahaa nahin gaya or maine haath khadaa kiya
 "sir?" "yes child, say what is the question?" "what is it to meet at infinity?" "meeting at infinity means meeting at infinity
 ”“haa to maath sa'ba, infinity par milanaa kya hota he?”“infinity par milanaa matlab anant par milanaa
 Tripathi ji said screaming
 “sar aap samaj nahin rahe hai
 i have understood that infinity means infinite
 lekin ye ‘milanaa’ kya hota he?”“pagalaa gaye ho kya balak? bina baat dimag kharaab kar rahe ho
 Come here and become a rooster
 ”“sar aap to bila vajah naaraaz ho rahe hai
 i asked a question in my mind
 '“sawaal gaya baba ji kii langoti main
 Now come here, do you become cock like straight or not? "" How was it to meet on Infinity, sir! In this way, the Asymptote will never meet the parabola
 sidhe-sidhe aap ye kyon nahin kah dete ki darasal donon kabhi milte hi nahin hai
 It just seems that the two are meeting somewhere
 ” maine murga bane hue ghutanon ke bich se treepathi ji ko ghoorte hue, dukhi man se jawaab diya
 My heart was broken
 saath main meri taangen bhi
 The real idea of how painful it is to remain a cock for half an hour is when you come back from the cuddled vagina to the human vagina
 chalanaa shuru karte hi ghutanon kii gend gravity or friction se jhagadna shuru karti hai jisamen bich-bich main aisa mahasoos hota he ki abhi achaanak ghutanon kii donon genden pop karke baahar aa jaaengi
 Even if Newton saw the apple falling, Gravity must have said hello
 lekin gravity se hamaari namaste to treepathi maath sa'ba ne hi karai thi
 If Shruti were in my class at this time, she would have been sad to see me become a cock
 wo mere class kii ladakiyon kii tarah nirmam or shailo nahin thi jo mujhe murga bane dekhakar honton par rumal lagaakar hans rahi thim
 In particular, she was not at all like Priyanka Singhania and Isha Kapoor, who had more to be Singhania and Kapoor than Gurur was in her beauty and accent English

 chif justise deepak mishra ke khilaaf mahabhiyog ke prastaav ko rajyasabha sabhapati dwaara khaarij karne ko supreme court main chunauti dene vaali yachika congress ne waapas le lee he
 After this the constitutional bench of 5 judges declared it rejected
 sheersh adaalat main is puure maamle main naatakeey ghatnakram dekhne ko mila
 The petition for rejection of the impeachment motion by Venkaiah Naidu was withdrawn after a five-judge bench refused to share a copy of the administrative order regarding the constitution of the constitutional bench
 maamle par pratikriya dete hue prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki yah bahut niraashajanak or durbhagyapurna he ki sanvaidhanik peeth ne prashasnic order kii copy share karne se inkaar kar diya
 Justice Seekie stated that they did not have a copy of the administrative order

 Actually, Kapil Sibal at one time demanded to show a copy of the administrative order related to constitution of constitutional bench
 jaisaaki unhen is bare main raat ke 10 baje soochna mili
 The bench then asked Kapil Sibal to show the petition first
 is par, atorni general ne kaha ki peeth yachikakarta ko prashasnic order kii copy nahin dikhaa sakati
 This bench said that the petition will be withdrawn or dismissed
 iske baad kapil sibbal ne yachika waapas le lee

 unhone kaha ki ye sirf nyaayik aadesh ke jariye hi samvidhan peeth ko bheja ja saktaa he, prashasnic aadesh ke jariye nahin
 We need that order, who sent this petition to the bench of five judges
 ham aadesh milane ke baad ise chunauti dene par vichaar karenge
 Justices Chelameswar, Gogoi, Lokur and Joseph are not, therefore, according to the constitution experts, the legal screw in this case was that even before the case of impeachment against the Chief Justice, he cannot hear it
 iske alaava varishthata kram main number do yani justise chelmeshwar, number teen justise ranjan gogoi, number chaar justise madan bi lokur or number paanch justise courian joseph ne press conference kar chif justise ke khilaaf apane pad or adhikaron kaa durupyog karne ke aarope lagaae the
 Because of this, they have all become parties in this matter
 aise main number chah se hi baat shuru hui
 What is the rationale of the Congress? The Congress says that the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha should have constituted a committee of at least three people, including a well-known figure of law and constitution, to examine the impeachment motion, but he decided to make the committee or on its behalf Took it before the report arrived

 It is shocking

 He said, i gave so much to the country and many people including the sports world promised me help, but i am sorry that no one is coming forward

 The difference is that this is a story that happens in Mumbai and in the end, every single wire of this murder mystery is clearly opened
 aaysha mahajan mumbai ke ek doctor danpati kii kishoravay beti he
 One night he is murdered
 usee raat se doctor kaa nayaa naukar gaayab he
 In police investigation, the needle of suspicion rests on Ayesha's father, Doctor Sachin Mahajan, and he is put behind bars
 magar phir jaanch sibiai afasar sunil parskar ke paas pahunchati he
 He examines every single case of the case afresh, and when the mystery finally unravels, you get a shock of all your ideas
 clymex is film kii sabase badi khubi he
 Usually, seeing the murder mystery, we select the suspected murderer from our arguments based on the available signals and then the mind starts to build a theory around him
 yahaan par ye sari kavayad uljhi hui lagati hai
 Talking about acting, KK Menon performs his work in the best manner in the role of a CBI officer
 magar behatar hota ki vah karamchand jasoos ke gaajar act kii tarj par ghadi ghadi dimag tej karne ke liye akhrot na khate
 Nice to see Ashish Vidyarthi in the role of Doctor Mahajan
 vah shandaar actor hai, magar idhar kuch barason se parde par dikhnaa band se ho gaye hai
 In the role of Ayesha's mother, Tisca Chopra and Brinda, a close friend of Dr
 Mahajan, Mita Vashistha also played many character roles

 Nimai Bali is a bit loud in the role of Inspector

 Early in the first half the film progresses according to Andaje
 aarushi murder cese ke itane naatakeey roopantaran dikhaae ja chuke hai ki kalpana ke liye zyada avkaash nahin rah jaataa
 But when KK Menon comes into the picture, the film's dark aspects and winding paths start to appear
 second half zyada ksaa hua he
 The first of the film's weaknesses is the screenplay being somewhat less tight
 ditels ke pher main film kii length bad gai he
 It could have been smaller
 iske alaava steriotip ko poshan dena bhi film ke dosha main hi gina jayega
 Police body language or court scenes
 yaa phir aaysha ke muslim premi kaa chithran, sab kuch filmi ravaayaton kaa aksharshah paalan karte najar aate hai
 Director Manish Gupta has maintained the pace of the film for the most part despite the length being somewhat longer
 jahaan kahin vah phani hone kii koshish karte hai, film kuch hichkole khaane lagati he
 But whether it is a new place or a character's style, his camera and his hold on the story is clearly visible
 haalanki cinemetography ke lihaaj se bahut zyada prayog nahin kiye gaye hai
 For those who like Murder Mystery and Investigation themed films, this film with a completely Indian plot can be a good option
