 The dispute started on Wednesday when the Indian Express published the news that on the night of 16 January, two important troops of the army were moving towards Delhi without the knowledge of the government, which caused the government to panic
 indian express ke puure panne par chhapi is khabar se joardaar hangaamaa ho gaya tha
 Although the newspaper now believes that the army had no ulterior motives, it claims that there was something in this movement, which was against the Quaidas, as the government also issued a lookout alert as soon as intelligence was received
 lekin is puri khabar se kuch sawaal bhi khadey hue hai
 When the army is telling the routine exercise to increase the troops of Delhi towards Delhi, then why did the Government's hands and feet thrive on it
 sabase ahm sawaal ab yah he ki kya sarkaar ko aisa laga ki iske peeche koi saazish he
 
 
 And if it did, then why
 tippaniyan According to information received from army sources, NDTV India is such an exercise, which happens once every two-three months
 in choti tukadiyon se kisi khatare kii baat bemaani he, lekin sawaal he ki is aam routine ke sarkaar ne khaas matlab kyon nikaale
 Is it because recently, there have been several confrontations between the army chief and the government

 And meanwhile, an important question arose as to who leaked the letter written to the Prime Minister of the Army Chief
 yah shaayad in sabhi vivaadon kaa bhi asar rahaa ki sena hili or sarkaar hilti dikhi
 Meanwhile, the editor of the English daily Indian Express, Shekhar Gupta, told NDTV that he was firm on the news of two army troops marching towards Delhi, and he was confident of his news
 yah vivaad buudhvaar ko us vakt shuru hua tha, jab indian express ne khabar chhaapi ki 16 janvari kii raat ko sarkaar kii jaankaree ke bina fouj kii do ahm tukadiyaan dilli kii taraf bad rahi thim, jisase sarkaar ghabara gai
 This news printed on the entire page of Indian Express caused a lot of uproar
 haalanki ab akhbaar bhi maan rahaa he ki sena kaa koi galat iraadaa nahin tha, lekin uskaa daawa he ki is halchal main kuch tha, jo kaayadon ke khilaaf tha, kyonki sarkaar ne bhi khufia soochna milte hi lukout alert jari kar diya tha
 But some questions have also arisen from this whole news
 jab fouj dilli kii ore sena kii tukadiyon ke badhane ko routine kavayad bataa rahi he, to us par sarkaar ke haath−paanv kyon phool gaye the
 The most important question now is whether the government felt that there was a conspiracy behind it
 
 
 or agar aisa laga, to kyon laga
 The comments enditivi india ko sena ke sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik aisi kavayad aam he, jo har do−teen maheene main ek baar hoti he
 The danger of any danger from these small squads is meaningless, but the question is why the government made special sense of this common routine
 kya isliye, kyonki haal hi main senapramukh or sarkaar ke bich kai baar takaraav dikhaai die
 Apart from the controversy related to Senapramukh's date of birth, a controversy came up about him being offered a bribe, another controversy over the weak preparation of the army
 
 
 or is bich ek ahm sawaal yah uthaa ki aakhir senapramukh kii pradhanmantri ko likhi chitthee kisne li kii
 It was probably also the effect of all these disputes that the army appeared shaken and the government moved
 indian express ke puure panne par chhapi is khabar se joardaar hangaamaa ho gaya tha

 They are first among equals
 ab wo bhi manushya hai, unki bhi apni kshamtaayen hai, apni takat he
 Many times are overloaded
 wo apane kaam shift kar den, kaam logon ko de den
 They keep giving and we are going to discuss it tomorrow or day after tomorrow
 "tippaniyan These questions are being asked to Kumar Vishwas because the discussion is going on whether Kejriwal should leave the post of National Convenor and become National Convenor after one defeat
 is sawaal ke jawaab main kumaar vishwaas ne kaha, "mujhe nahin lagata
 Arvind has not become the national convener because we asked him to become or the PAC said that he should become, rather all the workers asked him to become you
 ham sab isamen isliye sammilat hai
 You set an election process and a time and said that if they become, then they become
 " However, Kumar Vishwas questioned the resignation of party leaders from their posts and said, 'resignation is not the solution, it is these people who have to resign
 aaj sanjay bhai, durgesh yaa dilip apane pad se istife dekar is prakriya se alag ho gaye kya? wo to saath hi baithe hai naa
 Now we are talking some things, thinking of some other place, thinking of Delhi, thinking outside, what to do in Gujarat, what to do in Rajasthan? How to improve communication? So what is the need to do this roller coaster that you sit on this chair and then sit on this one
 meraa kahana he agar hamane apni haar se sabak siikhaa he to wo kisi bhi istife se zyaada or agar sabak nahin siikhaa to saare milakar bhi istife de do, sab frodbazi he
 " kumaar vishwaas se ye sawaal isaliye puche ja rahe hai kyonki charchaa chal rahi he ki ek ke baad ek haar ke baad kya kejariwal ko ab rashtriya sanyojak kaa pad chhod dena chahie or kumaar vishwaas rashtriya sanyojak bane
 In response to this question, Kumar Vishwas said, "I don't think so
 arvind rashtriya sanyojak isaliye nahin bane hai kyonki hamane kaha unako ki ban jaao yaa PAC ne kaha ki ban jaao, balki saare kaaryakartaaon ne unase kaha ki aap ban jaao
 We are all involved in this
 aapane ek chunaav prakriya or ek samay tay kiya or kaha ki ban jaao to wo ban gaye
 " haalanki kumaar vishwaas ne party netaaon ke apane padon se die istife par sawaal uthaate hue kaha, 'istifa dena koi hal nahin, istipha inhen logon ne lenaa inhen logon ne dena he
 Today, did Sanjay bhai, Durgesh or Dileep resign from their posts and break away from this process? They are sitting together too
 ab kuch baaten kar rahe hai, kuch or jagah kii soch rahe hai, dilli kii soch rahe hai, baahar kii soch rahe hai, gujarat me kya karen, rajasthan main kya karen? communication kaise sudhaaren? to ye roller coster karne kii kya aavashyaktaa he ki tum is vaali kursi se isapar baith jaao phir is vaali par baith janaa
 i say if we have learned a lesson from our defeat, then more than any resignation, and if we have not learned a lesson, then resign together, all is fraud
 " However, Kumar Vishwas questioned the resignation of party leaders from their posts and said, 'resignation is not the solution, it is these people who have to resign
 aaj sanjay bhai, durgesh yaa dilip apane pad se istife dekar is prakriya se alag ho gaye kya? wo to saath hi baithe hai naa

 According to the complaint filed by the woman, the businessman molested her after taking flight
 gujarat ke kai gaanvon main do saal tak 'pani he to jivan he, pani bachaao jivan bachaao' kii gunj ko gaanv-gaanv tak pahunchane kaa prayaas karti ek mahila ko kai logon ne dekha he
 His aim was that if our forefathers built ponds, the secret of that was that the water stored in the pond would not degrade and we could save the water flowing below the ground for the next generation
 aadhunik borwell ke jariye switch ko on karke kheton main pani dene vaale kisaan kuch samaj pate usase pehle hi nari shakti kaa parichay detii is mahila ne mahaj do saalon main 87 gujarat ke banaaskatha main talab bana ke dikhaae tab log dekhte hi rah gaye
 Mittal Patel, who is working to save water in the drought-hit districts of Gujarat, has one objective - to build a pond in every village
 jo wo 2017 se, yani do saal se lagaataar kar rahi hai
 This story began about two and a half years ago from Banaskantha in Gujarat
 mittal jal bachaane ke abhiyaan se judakar ek gaanv pahunchin
 According to Mittal, when she reached there, all four were dry, but there was plenty of water in the fields
 har kisaan ne apana-apana borwell kiya hua tha
 The more money, the deeper the borewell in the ground
 ek kisaan ne 13 sau feet neeche pipe dalava rakhaa tha
 Mittal said that i wanted to explain that borewell is not always the solution
 aise to jameen kaa pani ek roj khatm ho jayega
 There was no effect on the listeners
 phir maine aane vaali pidiyon kaa hawala diya ki sara pani ham istemaal kar lenge to hamaari aane vaali peediyaan kya karengi?iskaa thodaa asar hota dekh maine kaha- kyon na ham aapke gaanv main talab khudva den
 In the beginning, people from all the villages started laughing and people started to explain to me who does the pond in modern times
 maine himmat nahin haari mere prayaas se kuch din baad gaanv ke log talab khudwane ko taiyaar ho gaye, lekin pareshaani mittal ke peeche lagi thi kyonki yahaan duvidha yah bhi thi ki talab khudwana or use ‘mentin’ rakhana sarkari kaam he
 They were not willing to contribute to the pond in any way
 gaanvvaalon ne paise lagane se saaf inkaar kar diya
 Mittal also explained to the people here that we have limited resources and we will put up JCB
 mitti nikaalenge lekin mitti hataane ke liye trek aapako dena hoga, lekin ve ek rupaya lagane ko taiyaar nahin the
 Then we said - we will also put a tractor
 aapako bas itnaa karnaa he ki kaam karne waalon ke liye khaane kaa intjaam karnaa hoga
 While Mittal has started his campaign to save water since 2017, in the villages where ponds are being excavated, Mittal was present for the entire mission
 pehle jesibi se mitti nikaali jaati he, tractor se hataai jaati he
 Mittal explained the difference between bore wells and pond water, and also told them that your children will not have it either
 paison se jameen ke bheetar kaa khatm pani lautaaya nahin ja saktaa
 Mittal believes that our ancestors used to think tall
 talab banane kaa kaam shurubarish ke pani ko ikattha karne ke liye gaanv-gaanv main talab hua karte the
 They were connected to each other
 ek talab kaa pani overflo ho jaae to duusare se tisare main pahunch jaaya karata
 Now people think - if the water is getting low, then dig the ground a few feet and deep
 yahi vajah he ki pehle 40 feet khodne par pani mil jaataa tha, vahiin ab dedh sau feet gahare jane par bhi sookhaa miltaa he
 This work of Mittal paid off, now people are worried about the water, where the ponds have been dug, the villagers are trying to fill it
 kai gaanvon main panch-sarpanchon ne khud pahal kii or narmada pipeline ke jariye talab bharwaaye
 Ponds have been built in many places, but are waiting for rain
 mittal ke paas ab talab bananaa chaah rahe ho vaise gaanvon kii lambii list he, jo apane yahaan talab khudwana chaahate hai
 The sarpanch of the village has now come forward to dig the pond and has become a fan of this work of Mittal

 Teams like the UAE have been losing in the World Cup and in the group in which they are included, their defeat is predicted in advance, but the history of the World Cup also says that such teams can turn the match of any day
 Huh
 isliye yuai ko halke main lene kii galati team management nahin karnaa chahta
 Before this match, let us know why this match will be special
 perth kaa arthperth main bharat ne ajtak 4 match jite hai to 6 haare hai
 There was also a match tie, but the advantage still lies with Team India, as the UAE team has not played a single match in Perth till date
 haalanki bharat bhi pichley maheene kheli gai trisiris main england ke khilaaf mahaj 200 ranon par simat gaya tha
 In that series, there were many talks about the erratic rise of the Waka ground
 mana ja rahaa he ki pich kaa mizaaj ab bhi zyada badalegaa nahin
 india-uaet India have never experienced 874 one-day matches while the UAE has only 20 matches
 worldcup main bharat ne aaj tak 69 mukaable khele hai to yuai ne sirf 7, lekin worldcup main aaj tak donon kii takkar nahin hui
 India and UAE have met only twice before
 ek baar 1994 main sharajah main or duusari baar 2004 main dambula main or dono hi maukon par bharat ne badi jeet darj kii
 The India vs India UAE team has two players who are not only of Indian origin, but have also been active in India's domestic cricket for a long time
 pehle he swapnil patil jo mumbai kii under-14, under-16, under-19 or under-22 team ke liye cricket khel chuke hai
 Not only this, he has also made many big partnerships in domestic cricket with Team India batsman Ajinkya Rahane
 bharat main zyada mauka naa milane par patil naukari karne dubai chale gaye
 Where he got the chance to play cricket again
 yuai kii team main bhartiya mul ke duusare khilaadi he krishna chandran karate
 Krishna Chandran has also taken the field along with players like Dinesh Karthik, Robin Uthappa, Stuart Binny and s Sreesanth
 kerala kii under-19 team main khel chuke krishna chandran bhi bhartiya cricket main zyaada mauka naa milane kii vajah se dubai shift ho gaye the
 Where he made his name in club cricket
 in donon khilaadiyon ko bharat ke khilaaf mauka milane kii puri ummid he
 On the field, the Indian team has scored 300 or more against both Pakistan and South Africa and this time also the Indian team can get a chance to score big
 udhar, yuai ke ballebaaj bhi khaase rang main dikhaai de rahe hai
 The UAE batsmen scored over 275 against both Ireland and Zimbabwe and forced the front team to struggle in both matches
 iske alaava yuai kii team gendbaaji or fielding main bhi jabardast pradarshan kar rahi he, aise main team india ko saavdhaan rahane kii jarurat hogi
 If the Indian team has lost to an associate team in the World Cup, it was the Sri Lankan team that defeated India by 47 runs in a match of 1979 World Cup
 worldcup kaa itihaas aise maichon se bharaa padaa he jahaan choti tiimon ne badi tiimon ko naakon chane chabava die hai
 Kenya defeated the West Indies in the 1996 World Cup, while Zimbabwe beat India in the 1999 World Cup
 2003 ke vishwacap main kenya ne srilanka ko haraaya to bharat ne kenya ke khilaaf hi semifinal muqabla khelaa
 In the 2007 World Cup, when Ireland beat Pakistan and created a sensation, in the 2011 World Cup, England was given water, Ireland also defeated the West Indies in this World Cup

 amuman ham sabhi ke gharon main andey frij main hi rakhe jate hai
 In almost every fridge, there is also space to keep eggs separately
 par haal main hi ek adhyayan ke tahat vaigyanikon ne ye daawa kiya he ki andon ko frij main rakhana surakshit nahin he
 Scientists have also given some arguments in support of this point
 isse pehle kii ham nai manyataon ke bare main jaane ek baat spasht kar dena jaruri he ki frij main rakhe andey, baahar rakhe andon kii tulana main zyada vakt tak taaja bane rahete hai or taaja hone ke kaaran inkaa swaad bhi bana rahata he
 Despite this, its scientists have misunderstood this trend that has been going on for years
 1
 Temperature: If you have to use eggs to make a baking product, it is better not to keep it in the fridge
 frij main rakhe andon ko phentna apekshaakrit thodaa mushkil hota he
 Which makes a difference in color and taste
 2
 If you have noticed the fear of breaking, then after buying and bringing the eggs to boil immediately, they do not burst, but there is always a fear of their eggs bursting in the boil
 3
 The risk of bacteria is the possibility of condensation when the egg is kept in the refrigerator after keeping it at normal temperature
 condenseshan seande ke chhilake par maujuud bacteria kii gati bad sakati he or uske bheetar pravesh karne ke chancej bhi bad jate hai
 Consuming such eggs can be dangerous
 4
 If the infection remains dirt on the upper part of the egg several times, it can also infect other things in the fridge
 aise main andey ko frij main rakhane se kai tarah ke sankraman kaa khatra ho saktaa he
 5
 zyada sehatmandaye sach he ki frij main rakhe andey baahar rakhe andon kii tulana main zyada din tak thik rahete hai lekin frij main bahut adhik thand hone kii vajah se andey ke kuch poshak tav nasht ho jate hai
 Eggs kept at room temperature are far healthier than eggs kept in the fridge

 After the crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress Party is not taking the name of the problems
 chunaavon ke thik baad hi party adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne apane pad se istipha de diya
 In the month of July itself, the Congress Party has suffered two more setbacks
 karnataka main congress-jedies kii sarkaar 14 maheenon main hi gir gai kyonki gathbandhan ke 15 vidhayakon ne baghawat ko anjaam de diya
 In Goa too, 10 out of 15 Congress Party mlas have joined BJP
 party itane bade sankaton se jujh rahi he or is samay rahul gandhi dur-dur tak kahin najar nahin aa rahe hai
 But even in this difficult period, if any Congress leader has not lost courage, it is Priyanka Vadra
 loksabhaa chunaavon main mili haar ke baad priyanka raajnneeti main ab or bhi zyada sakriy ho gai hai
 Now she is raising her voice even more vocally than before, whether it is on the ground or on social media
 soshal media kii agar baat karen to priyanka is maamle main apane bhai rahul gandhi se bhi aage nikal gai hai
 Data Intelligence Unit of India Today analyzed the Twitter data of Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi from 1 March 2019 to 20 July 2019 and found that Priyanka Gandhi is now seen growing up and raising her voice on the social media platform whereas Rahul Gandhi was the first Have now become less active
 chunaav ke samay twitor par wo itani sakriy nahin thim
 What do the figures say? Priyanka Gandhi opened an account on Twitter in February, just before the election
 unhone apana pehla twit march main kiya
 In the month of March, he posted a total of 18 tweets
 april ke maheene main unhone 16 baar twit kiya or may main 8 baar
 She got active again after the Lok Sabha elections were over and tweeted 18 times in the month of June
 20 july tak priyanka 38 baar twit kar chuki hai
 On the other hand, his brother Rahul Gandhi posted 47 tweets in March which increased to 54 in April, and since then they have been continuously falling
 may main unhone 45 baar twit kiya, june main 24 baar or 20 july tak unhone keval 12 twit hi post kiye
 Rahul is still more popular and though Gandhi has become more active than Rahul, but his brother is still more popular than him on Twitter
 rahul gandhi ke twits ko milane vaale ausat ri-twit priyanka ko milane vaale ri-twit se kaaphi zyada he
 This is because there is a difference in the sky between Priyanka Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi
 priyanka gandhi ke twitor par lagbhag 6 lakh folovers hai vahiin unke bhai rahul ke 1 karod se kuch zyada folovers hai- priyanka se lagbhag 20 guna zyada
 Still the difference is clear
 Along with the figures, the style of tweeting of both Congress leaders is different
 priyanka zyaadaatar hindi main hi twit karti hai
 Of his total 98 tweets, 70 per cent are in Hindi and the rest in English
 rahul gandhi ke sirf 27 pratishat twit hi hindi main hai, 71 fisadi angreji main or baaki 2 fisadi tamil, malayalam or marathi main hai
 Apart from this, Priyanka Gandhi is seen promoting the national and local competitions on Twitter
 khaastaur par utar pradesh se
 She also posts links to several news stories through which she brings the Yogi government to the attention of the public
 pichley hafte, priyanka gandhi ne us vakt khub surkhiyaan batori jab unako mirzapur main yogi sarkaar ne hiraasat main le liya tha
 Priyanka had gone to meet the victims of the massacre at Sonbhadra
 iske khilaaf unhone khub dharna pradarshan kiya or ant main ve peedit parivaar waalon se milakar hi maanin
 He expressed his anger on Twitter and also put a video of his meeting with family members
 rahul gandhi kaa twitor handle zyaadaatar centre sarkaar, pradhanmantri modi or bijepi ko kendrit karata najar aata he
 Like his sister, he also promotes local talent, but this happens rarely
 rahul gandhi ne us vakt twitor yujaron ko naakhush kar diya tha jab unhone antarrashtriya yoga diwas par sena ke dog squad par fabtiyaan kasi
 He tweeted a photo of the Army Dog Squad trying to do yoga with the caption 'new India'

 ) supreme court ne buudhvaar ko sarkari naukari main essi / asti samudaay ko pramotion main aarakshan par badafaislasunaya
 The Court upheld the decision on reservation in promotion 12 years ago with some changes
 court ne kaha ki is par phir se vichaar karne kii zarurat or aankade jutaney kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 In a way, the top court has retained the 2006 Amnagarajamalle to a large extent
 haalanki, supreme court ne kaha he ki rajya sarkaron ke liye essi / asti varg ke pichhadepan or rojgaar main unki hissedari se jude aankade jutanaa jaruri nahin he
 The Supreme Court has approved the arguments of the Center and the states on this issue
 jabaki nagaraj maamle main court ne shart lagaai thi ki pramotion main aarakshan se pehle yah dekhnaa hoga ki aparyaapt pratinidhitiv he yaa nahin
 Explain that for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, in 1955, the new Jawaharlal Nehru Government was the 77th amendment to the Constitution and new section 4 / a was added to Article 16
 isi ke tahat essi-asti samudaay ko sarkari naukari main variyata dete hue unka pramotion kiya ja saktaa tha
 Thus SC / ST community was first given reservation in promotion in 1955
 iske baad se lagaataar pramotion main aarakshan mil rahaa tha
 However, a 1992 Supreme Court ruling involving Indira Sawhney had said that the condition of creamy layer would not apply in the case of SC ST
 isi kaa nateeja he ki essi asti ke sabhi logon ko aarakshan kaa phayda miltaa aa rahaa he
 But a 2005 five-judge Bench judgment in the EV Chennaiyah case ruled that the SC-ST community was divided into creamylayer and non creamylayer by the Andhra Pradesh government
 court ne kaha tha ki essi-asti ke bare main raashtrapati ke aadesh par jari list main koi chhedchhad nahin ho sakati or sirf sansad hi kanoon banaakar badlaav kar sakati he
 The constitutional validity of reservation in promotions to SC / ST community was challenged by m Nagaraj in the Supreme Court
 saal 2006 main em nagaraj banaam union of india cese main supreme court kii paanch jajon kii hi ek samvidhan peeth ne faisla diya tha ki sarkari naukariyon main padonnati main anusuchit jati / anusuchit janajati (essi-asti) virgon ko samvidhan ke anuchhed 16 (4) or 16 (4kha) ke tahat aarakshan diya ja saktaa he, par iske liye sarkaar ko kuch sharton ko puraa karnaa hoga
 The apex court had also ordered that before making reservations in promotions for SC-ST classes, the government would have to collect data on how backward this section of society is and how much they are represented in government jobs and if If they get reservation in promotion, then how will this initiative affect the functioning of the government
 supreme court ke faisle ke baavjood kai rajya sarkaron ne bina aankada jutaaye hi pramotion main aarakshan dena jari rakhaa
 On this basis, in 2010, Rajasthan High Court banned reservation in promotions to SC / ST community in the state
 iske baad 2011 main elahabaad hai court ne bhi padonnati main aarakshan ke uttar pradesh sarkaar ke faisle ko radd kar diya tha
 Despite this, the then Chief Minister of UP Mayawati gave reservation to the Dalit community in the promotion
 haalanki, 2012 main upi main satta main ai sapa sarkaar ne essi / asti samudaay ko pramotion main aarakshan se haath khinch liye the
 After this, the Madhya Pradesh government also banned reservation in promotions
 iske baad ye dalit samudaay ke log ise lekar supreme court aae, jis par buudhvaar ko aitihaasik faisla aayaa he
 The court clearly said that the state governments can give reservation in promotion if they want, but it is not necessary to give figures for this

 com / opbi01yale Senior BJP leader Murali Manohar Joshi said that if every common man adopts yoga in his life, it will help in reducing the incidence of rape in the country
 joshi ne ravivaar ko kaha ki muslim din main paanch baar yoga karte hai or unhone paigambar mohammad ko sabase mahaan yogi bataaya
 He said, 'I believe that if yoga comes into the life of the common man, then the incidence of rape will reduce in the coming days
 main yah nahin kahuunga ki ve bilkul khatm ho jaaengi, lekin nishchit rup se unamem kami aegi
 In a ceremony based on yoga, Joshi said, "this will create a new mindset between men and women
" maanav sharir ke bare main soch main badlaav aayega ki sharir ek aisi mashin he, jise prakruti ne hamen bade makasad ke liye pradaan kiya he
 People's attention will go to this
 ' maharishi mahesh yogi dwaara pesh yoga kii ek vidhi par neuyark main kiye gaye prayog kaa zikr karte hue joshi ne kaha ki jab ek vishvavidhyalay ke vaais chancelar ne isaki samiksha kii to paaya ki neuyark main aparaadh dar kam ho gai he or jelon main kaidiyon ke vyavhaar main badlaav aayaa he
 Joshi further said, 'our Muslim brothers do yoga five times a day
 namaaj main baithne kii mudraaen yoga kii mudraaen hai
 He said, 'therefore i understand that Mohammad Saheb was a great yogi
 ishwar se prarthana karne kii yah vidhi ise yoga se jodatii he
 He could not do it without practicing yoga
 ' kaushal vikaas par sarkaar dwaara die ja rahe dhyaan kaa ullekh karte hue joshi ne kaha ki aayush, shiksha , swasthya or kaushal samet vibhinn mantralayon ke bich samanvay samooh hona chahie taaki yah dekha ja sake ki yoga kaa kis tarah se saamaajik or aarthik jivan main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Referring to a former army chief preaching yoga in the army, Joshi suggested that the country's security forces should also be taught yoga
 unhone kaha, meraa suzav yah he ki hamaare desh kii sena or police ko yoga kii shiksha tathaa abhyaas sikhaaya janaa chahie
 If policemen start doing yoga then they will be able to convince people through conversation and thus their behavior will also change
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki yadi koi bhi vyakti vedon yaa upanishdon ke mantron kaa uccharan kar koi kaam shuru karata he to uske parinaam achche honge
 Describing yoga not only for humans, but also for birds and animals, Joshi said that yoga connects humans as well as animals
 unhone kaha, yadi aap dhyanpurvak dekhen to prakruti main jaanavar or pakshi bhi yoga karte hai
 Sharing his views on yoga, the senior BJP leader said that Mayur asana, snake asana is natural
 aisa nahin he ki yah keval insaanon ke liye he balki jaanwaron or pakshiyon ke liye bhi he
 It is also possible that these insects are also meant for spiders
 yah hamen na keval insaanon se balki jaanwaron se bhi jodta he
 Joshi said that yoga is the greatest option to bring peace, order and prosperity throughout the country
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki shiksha ke prayek kshetra main yoga ko lagu karnaa behad jaruri he
 He also said that India can benefit the world through Yoga, Ayurveda and Sanskrit language

 jedies-congress gathbandhan sarkaar ke 11 vidhayak shanivaar ko istipha dene ke liye spikar karyaalay pahunch gaye or apana istipha saunp diya
 After this move by the mlas, the government of Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy appears to be in danger and the path seems to be easy for the BJP desperate for government formation
 asal main, karnataka main kul 224 vidhansabha siten hai, bahumat ke liye 113 vidhayak chahie
 BJP currently has 105 mlas
 jabaki congress ke paas 80 or jedies ke paas 37 vidhayak hai
 Thus, both have a total of 117 mlas
 bahujan samaaj party (basapa) or nirdaleey vidhayak bhi gathbandhan kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 However, after the resignation of two Congress mlas and expulsion of one MLA, the number of Congress mlas has been reduced to 77
 congress-jedies kii sankhya 114 rah gai he
 At the same time, BJP is already claiming that there is secret support of 6 Congress mlas and 2 JDS mlas, who will resign soon
 bijepi pradesh main sarkaar banane kii ummid lagaae baithi he or lagaataar iske liye daawey bhi kar rahi he
 The resignation of jds-congress mlas is increasing Kumaraswamy's troubles, but the BJP is not in a position to form a government
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi silent oparation lotus chalaa rahi he, taaki aisi sthiti bane jab kumaraswami bahumat se neeche aa jaaen or bijepi apni sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kare
 Significantly, through Operation Lotus, BJP was successful in forming the government in Karnataka in 2008 also
 us samay bijepi 224 main se 110 siten jitkar ai thi
 In such a situation, BJP used Operation Lotus to touch the majority figure
 congress or jedies ke aath vidhayakon ne vyaktigat kaarnon kaa hawala dete hue vidhansabha kii sadsyta se istipha de diya tha
 After this, all these 8 leaders were contested by the BJP on their election symbol, of which five came from BJP and three were defeated
 is tarah se bijepi ne bahumat kaa jaadui aankada paar kar liya tha
 This time too, if the bjp's strategy is successful, the coming days may prove to be difficult for the Kumaraswamy-led congress-jds government
 modi sarkaar is baat par gambhirtha se vichaar kar rahi he ki agar saansad sadan main kaam nahin karte hai to unpar bhi kaam nahin to vetan nahin kii baat lagu kii jaae
 111 mps from 11 states have agreed on this, especially that they also have seven Union Ministers
 kendriya mantri doctor mahesh sharma kehete hai ki jab ek majdoor kaam nahin karata he to use vetan nahin diya jaataa he to phir ye baat saansadon par kyon nahin lagu ho sakati

 haalanki kuch samay pehle bihar ke rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ne ghoshnaa karte hue kaha tha ki vah rajyasabha kii ummidavaari main mayawati kaa samarthan karegi
 With her support, Mayawati may possibly return to the Rajya Sabha in 2018

 khud peedit ladki, uski chachee or mausi
 An aunt and aunt also die in a road accident on Sunday
 jabaki khud peedit ladki or uske vakil najuk haalat main aspataal main hai
 Now the question is whether the death of the people associated with the case is a coincidence or a conspiracy? a 17-year-old girl accuses the ruling MLA of rape
 ilzaam lagaate hi aadki rahasyamayi taur par gaayab ho jaati he
 The girl's mother goes to the police to write a missing report
 ladki haroonges taur par waapas aa jaati he

 The police, accused, accusations, threats, evidences and the changing face and intrigue of the witnesses, there is bound to be suspicion

 But the question is whether the UP police is really looking at this accident with suspicion or not? bhartiya rigerv bank (arabiai) aaj apni byaaj daron kii samiksha karne vaala he or jo sanket mil rahe hai unase lagata he ki ab byaaj daren nahin badhengi

 But if you are thinking that soon your home loan interest rate will come down, then stop expecting this
 mahangaai dar jis str par he use dekhte hue yah ummid kam hi he ki arabiai repo rate yaa siaraar main kami kare
 The repo rate is the rate at which the Reserve Bank lends to other banks and the CRR is the amount that banks have to keep with the RBI
 ab rigerv bank ko girti vikaas dar thaamne kii phikr he
 In fact, due to increase in interest rate, demand has come down and production has fallen due to decrease in demand which has affected the growth rate

 chhattisgarh main bhartiya janata party ke mukh patr ‘deep camel’ ke ‘manhagaai dian’ vaale mukhya prishth ko lekar rajya main raajnneetik bakheda khadaa ho gaya he
 The state's main opposition party, Congress, has called it an indicator of petty mentality, while the BJP has accused the Congress of intolerance
 aamir khan kii film ‘pipali live’ kaa gaanaa ‘sakhi sainyaan to khub hi kamaat he, manhagaai dian khaay jaat he
 'is being used very politically here
 chhattisgarh main is ‘manhagaai dian’ ne acha khaasaa bakheda khadaa kar diya he
 The monthly magazine published in the state under the name of 'deep Kamal' is considered to be the mouthpiece of the BJP
 patrika ke prakaashak or mudrak rajya ke nagareey prashasan mantri rajesh munat hai or bhaajapa netaa subhash raav patrika ke sampadak hai
 The July issue of this magazine came out recently and a controversy also arose
 darasal yah vivaad is patrika ke mukhya prishth par bane cartoon ko lekar he, jisamen panja chhap tilak lagaae ek dian kaa chitra he or isamen ‘manhagaai dian khaay jaat he’ likhaa hua he
 Not only this, there is also a picture of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar in this cartoon
 vahiin aam aadmi manhagaai ke boj tale dabaa hua he
 The editor of the magazine, Subhash Rao in his editorial, has whipped the Congress for inflation
 congress ke netaaon ne ise bhaajapa kii ochhi maansikta kaa pratik bataaya he
 Ravindra Choubey, Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly, says: "looking at the magazine, it seems that the BJP is trying to impose all the responsibility of inflation on the Congress and the cartoon printed in it is a symbol of petty mentality
 ’ choube kehete hai ki jis tareeke se cartoon banaaya gaya he vah maansik vikruti or diwaliyapan kii nishaani he
 It can only be condemned
 vahiin congress ke anya netaaon ne ise avmaananaa kaa maamla bataaya or kaha ki aisi patrika kaa panjikaran radd kar diya janaa chahie
 Chhattisgarh Pradesh Congress Committee spokesperson Ramesh Valrayani says that democratic values are being depreciated through this magazine and registration of such magazine should be canceled
 valryani kehete hai ki yah avmaananaa kaa bhi maamla he or party ne vikalp khulaa rakhaa he
 After the political uproar in the state over the magazine, BJP has alleged that the Congress is creating unnecessary controversy over the issue
 bhaajapa ke pradesh upaadhyaksh sachchidanand upasne kehete hai ki kamartod manhagaai ko rokane main vifal congressi anaavashyak vivaad paidaa kar mul mudde se peechha chhudaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Upasane says that no one has been disrespected in the July issue of 'deep Kamal'
 balki ek cartoonist ke nazariye se mahangaai kii vikaraalata ko saamne rakhane kaa prayaas kiya gaya he
 It is a matter of regret that the Congressmen have become intolerant to such an extent that they are unable to tolerate even the common democratic and constructively laid out subject
 pyaar kaise bhi ho saktaa he
 On someone's nose ring, on someone's crooked neck or hair grooming, writing 'OK' on 'K' or accented by sophisticated, from the internet chatroom to the railway waiting room and the niece of a distant relative

 Love has become like a degree at Yale University
 weekend aate-aate ho jaati he pataa bhi nahin lagata, isliye tedi bear kaa diya janaa milastone kaa kaam karata he
 The relationship status of the girls can also be told by looking at their face and face while chatting, but the boys only get to know when earphones in the ear are seen on the roof or in the hand with a big teddy coming out of the gift shop
 kisi kanya ko tedi bear milte dekhie uskaa riection kuch yun hota he maano doctor ne ukhdati saanson ke bich marij ko oxigen laga diya ho
 Seeing Teddy's fascination, he wonders how was he still alive without it? If you look at the nomenclature thereafter, you will know that the girl lives in Netanyahu to Xi Jingping, Mandarin, Hebrew or German, French, Italian
 Teddy is given a name by bringing a word from a language that is not even heard of
 ladakiyon ko uphaar swaroop tedi dene kii pratha kisne shuru kii ye to nahin pataa, lekin jisane bhi kii lakhon ke juuton ke talle ghisne se bachaa liye, varna aadhi umr pasand jaanane main or aadhi umr pasand chhaantane main guzar jaati
 The use of teddy makes sense when she gets beaten up when talking
 ladkiyaan tedi bear isliye pasand karti hai kyonki sara din wo aapke kaan nahin khinch saktin
 When Kanye's mother asks her to clean the kitchen as well, then complains to Teddy, from the overpowered love to the shower of selfies to the breakup, Teddy has to suffer and eventually the boys' love, proving Teddy to be tortured
