 Director Mohit Suri's film 'half Girlfriend', released on Friday, is seen opposite Arjun Kapoor and Shraddha Kapoor for the first time
 is film main arjuna or shraddha ke alaava vikrant maise or seemaa biswas bhi najar aa rahe hai
 The story of the film begins with the character of Madhav Jha, who comes from a village in Patna to attend St
 Stephen's College in Delhi, but due to lack of English, he has to face problems
 aakhirkaar apni hajir javaabi or sports cote kii vajah se use college main daakhila mil jaataa he
 The comments isi college main madhav kii mulaakaat hoti he riya yani shraddha kapur se jo ek amir parivaar se kii beti hai
 Basket hair causes friendship between Madhav and Riya
 ye dono samaaj ke alag alag parivesh se aate hai par phir bhi inaki dosti ho jaati he, jise madhav shaadi ke anjaam tak pahunchaana chahta he lekin riya is rishte main koi jaldbaaji nahin karnaa chaahati
 But when Madhav asks, she says that he is her 'half-girlfriend'
 ab aage isamen kya hota he or yah half garlfriend madhav kii phul garlfriend ban paati he yaa nahin, yah to aapako film dekhakar hi pataa chalegaa
 Talking about some of the film's merits and some shortcomings, the first among the shortcomings is weak, its story which has no newness
 yah film lekhak chetan bhagat ke noval 'half garlfriend' par hi aadhaarit he
 You have seen this type of story in many films before
 kai baar aisa bhi hota he ki kahani bhale hi puraani ho par film kaa screen play, uske moments or nirdesan film ko prabhaavshaalee bana detaa he par yahaan aisa bhi nahin ho paaya he
 There are lots of cliches in the film, that is, there are many situations and events in which you will not see anything new or different
 main shraddha kapur ke kirdaar par bhi roshni daalana chaahunga, jo mujhe film main thodaa canafujd laga
 Now it is difficult to say whether this mistake happened to the director or to the reverence itself
 film kii achchhaayiyon kii baat karen to yun to ye lav story he par filmkaar ne saamaajik jimmedaari nibhaate hue beti bachaao beti padhaao or skulon main ladakiyon ke liye shauchalae hone chahie jaise muddon par bhi jor diya he, jo acha sandesh he
 If i talk about Arjun Kapoor, he will be honest to me about his character and along with him Vikrant's work is also good
 is film kii ek or khubi he iske gane kii likhaai or sangeet jo dono hi mujhe pasand aae
 Some scenes can touch your heart like a train scene between Arjun and Shraddha or finding Arjun's character Riya like crazy
 film dekhne yaa na dekhne kaa faisla aapke haathon main he par hamaari taraf se is film ko milte hai

 It is in this college that Madhav meets Riya i
e
 Shraddha Kapoor, who is the daughter of a rich family
 madhav or riya ke bich dosti kaa kaaran banati he basket bal
 They both come from different environments of the society, but still they become friendships, which Madhav wants to bring to the end of the marriage but Riya does not want to make any haste in this relationship
 lekin jab madhav ke poochne par wo kahati he kii wo uski 'half garlfriend' he
 Now what happens in this next and whether or not this half-girlfriend becomes Madhav's full girlfriend or not, you will only know by watching the film
 film kii kuch khoobiyon or kuch khaamiyon kii baat karen to kamiyon main sabase pehle kamjor he isaki kahani jisamen kuch nayaapan nahin he
 The film is based on the novel 'half Girlfriend' by writer Chetan Bhagat
 is tarah kii kahani kai filmon main aap pehle dekh chuke hai
 Many times it happens that even though the story is old, the screen play of the film, its moments and direction makes the film impressive but it has not been done here either
 film main clice bahut hai yani bahut si paristhitiyaan or ghatnaayen aisi hai jinamein aapako kuch nayaa yaa alag najar nahin aayega
 i would also like to throw light on the character of Shraddha Kapoor, which i felt a bit confused in the film
 ab ye chook nirdeshak se hui yaa khud shraddha se, yah kahana mushkil he
 Talking about the goodness of the film, Yun To Yeh Love Story Hai, but the filmmaker has also emphasized on issues like Beti Bachao Beti Padhao and social toilets and there should be toilets for girls in schools, which is a good message
 arjuna kapur kii agar baat karu to wo apane kirdaar ke prati mujhe eemaandaar najar aae or unke saath-saath vikrant kaa bhi kaam acha he
 Another unique feature of this film is its song writing and music which i both like
 kuch seens aapke dilon ko chhu sakate hai jaise train kaa ek seen jo arjuna or shraddha ke bich he yaa phir arjuna ke kirdaar kaa riya ko paaglon kii tarah dhundhna
 The decision to watch or not to watch the film is in your hands, but we get this film from our side

 While the Aam Aadmi Party is preparing to surround the BJP on sealing, FDI, demonetisation and GST, on the other hand, 20 AAP mlas have been processed in the Office of Profit case
 unki sadsyta hi radd kar di gai he
 In such a situation, the AAP, which has a majority of 67 mlas, now has only 46 mlas

 com / 9qzu52btay — Manish Sisodia (@msisodia) January 22, 2018 In his letter, Sisodia wrote that today i want to speak directly to you through this open letter
 man duhkhi he, par niraash nahin hum
 Because i trust you
 dilli ke or desh ke log meri aashaa hai
 Three years ago, you formed the Aam Aadmi Party government by choosing 67 mlas out of 70
 aaj inhone aapke 20 vidhayakon ko barkhaast kar diya
 They say that these 20 mlas were in "positions of profit"
 manish sisodiya ne patr main likhaa ki hamane in 20 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv banaaya tha or inhen alag-alag jimmedaariyaan di thi
 For example, a legislator was given the responsibility of government schools
 wo roj sarkari skulon main jaataa tha, dekhtaa tha ki teacher aae hai, sab kuch thik chal rahaa he
 Used to take action where needed
 isi tarah ekavidhayakako sarkari aspataalon kii jimmedaari di, ek vidhayak ko mohalla clinics kii jimmedaari di
 In this way, we gave different responsibilities to 20 mlas
 badale main in vidhayakon ko koi sarkari gaadi nahin di, koi bangala nahin diya, ek nayaa paisa tankhwaah nahin di
 Did not give anything
 ye sabhi vidhayak apane khud ke paise kharch karke kaam karte the, kyonki ye sab andolan se aae the or desh ke liye kaam karne kaa junun tha

 In the wake of the penetration of Asaduddin Owaisi's party AIMIM in West Bengal politics, Mamta Banerjee attacked him in a public meeting without naming Owaisi
 kuch din pehle bihar ke muslim bahul ilaake se eimm ke ummidavaar ne vidhansabha upachunaav main apni jeet darj kii thi
 This area is adjacent to West Bengal, due to this Mamta Banerjee seems to be shocked
 mamata banerjee ne apane bhaashan main aarope lagaaya ki ovaisi kii party bijepi se paisa lekar kaam kar rahi he
 These too are Muslim extremists like Hindu extremists
 mamata banerjee ke is aarope kaa jawaab dete hue eimm pramukh asaduddin ovaisi ne kaha- ''ye koi dharmik ativaadee nahin he jo ye kah rahe hai ki bengal ke musalmaan maanav vikaas suchakank main kisi bhi alpsankhyak kii tulana main sabase kharaab haalat main he
 Owaisi said that if Didi is so upset with the 'hyderabad people', then she should explain how BJP won 18 out of 42 seats in West Bengal in the Lok Sabha elections
 ovaisi ne kaha ki mere khilaaf aarope lagaakar sushri mamata banerjee pashchim bengal ke musalamaanon ko yah sandesh de rahi hai ki ovaisi kii party rajya main ek majboot takat banane ja rahi he
 Mamta Banerjee is displaying her fear and frustration by making such comments
 Asaduddin Owaisi, AIMIM: By making allegations against me you are giving the message to Muslims of Bengal that Owaisi's party has become a formidable force in the state
 Mamata Banerjee is showcasing her fear & frustration by making such comments

 isse pehle pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne kaha he ki alpsankhyakon ke bich ativaadee pahunch rahe hai jaise ki hinduon ke bich charampanthi

 railway kii do sabase badi unionon ne dhamkee di he ki agar rail kiraye badaye jane ke faisle ko waapas liya jaataa he tab vah deshbhar main pradarshan karengi
 1
4 million employees are members of these unions
 tippaniyan Railway unions say they are not fighting for Dinesh Trivedi
 unki ladaai railway kii khasta haalat ko sudhaarney ke liye he kyonki railway behad mushkilon ke daur se guzar rahaa he
 According to railway unions, the decision to increase the railway fare of Dinesh Trivedi is right
 do badi unionon ke saath teen or railway union bhi is sambhavit pradarshan ko samarthan de sakati hai
 The last time the Union of Railways was demonstrated was in 1974
 railway unionon kaa kahana he ki vah dinesh trivedi ke liye nahin lard rahe hai
 Their fight is to improve the bad condition of the railway as the railway is going through a lot of difficulties
 railway unionon ke mutabik dinesh trivedi kaa rail kiraaya badaye jane kaa faisalaa ekadam sahi he
 Three more railway unions along with two major unions could also support this potential performance
 aakhri baar railway union kaa pradarshan 1974 main hui thi
 According to railway unions, the decision to increase the railway fare of Dinesh Trivedi is right
 do badi unionon ke saath teen or railway union bhi is sambhavit pradarshan ko samarthan de sakati hai

 voton kii ginati 16 may ko subah shuru hogi or dopaher tak tasviir saaf ho jaaegi ki kiski sarkaar banegi
 If the trends of opinion polls change in the result, then NDA government can be formed under the leadership of Narendra Modi
 sawaal ye he ki kis tarah kii hogi ye sarkaar or modi ke mantrimandal main koun-koun shaamil ho saktaa he or kise koun sa mantrimandal mil saktaa he? For this, one has to look at the way Modi works
 gujarat main wo 2001 se mukhyamantri hai
 He has all the sources of power in his hand
 wo rajya ke sarvesarva hai
 He also holds the key to the party organization
 pradesh adhyaksh or aresas se aane vaale sanghathan mantri kii tainaati main unki pasand kaa khaas dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he
 They decide the accountability of ministers
 parfarmens audit hota he
 Government runs more through officers and technocrats
 sambhaavna he ki narendra modi pradhanmantri banane par grih mantralay apane paas hi rakhen or bharose ke rajya mantriyon ke sahare desh ke sabase mahatvapurn mantralayon main se ek, ye mantralay chalaaen
 This will probably be a unique experiment in itself
 amuman grahamantri ko pradhanmantri ke baad sarkaar main number do mana jaataa he
 But by doing this, Modi can only end this debate
 sirf grih mantralay hi nahin, sambhaavna ye bhi he ki modi infrastracchar ke lihaaz se behad mahatvapurn bhootal parivahan or jahazrani jaise mantralay bhi sidhe apane paas hi rakhen
 By doing this, they can bring faster pace of functioning in these ministries which are very important in terms of investment and employment generation
 raisina hill yaa tile par north blaak or south blaak main chaar mahatvapurn mantralay hai
 Home, Finance, Foreign and Defense
 modi ke bharosemand arun jetali vitt mantralay kii zimmedaari sambhaal sakate hai
 While Sushma Swaraj can be given the responsibility of the Ministry of External Affairs
 modi kii koshish hogi ki rajnath singh sarkaar main aaen
 However, he has denied this
 unke raji hone par unhen raksha mantralay diya ja saktaa he
 There is little chance of any allied party getting any of these important ministries
 aresas saafe kar chukaa he mahatvapurn mantralay bijepi ke paas hi rahane chahien
 It is worth noting that in the Vajpayee government, George Fernandes was the Ministry of Defense
 party ke kai varisht netaaon jaise venkaiya naidu, nitin gadakari, ravishankar prasad aadi kaa sarkaar main shaamil hona tay mana ja rahaa he
 However, Gadkari is keen on becoming the party president
 badi sankhya main party sanghathan se varisht netaa sarkaar main jaaenge
 Party general secretaries Anant Kumar, Dharmendra Pradhan, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Jagat Prakash Nadda, Thawarchand Gehlot may be made cabinet ministers in the Modi government
 arun shouri kii vaapasi kii sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 bjp's allies will also find a place in the cabinet
 shivasena, akali dal or lok janashakti party ke netaaon ko kai mahatvapurn mantralay mil sakate hai
 Shiv Sena leader Suresh Prabhu can also be given great responsibility
 kul mila kar modi kii koshish hogi ki mantrimandal bahut bada na ho
 Yet the question remains about the role of Lal Krishna Advani
 ye sambhaavna na ke baraabar he ki wo mantri banenge
 It is also more likely that he will continue in his post of executive chairman of NDA
 jabaki murali manohar joshi agar sarkaar main shaamil hone se inkaar karte hai to unhen spikar kii zimmedaari bhi di ja sakati he
 Obviously these are only possibilities
 bijepi main abhi is bare main praathmik str par bhi charchaaen bhi shuru nahin hui hai kyonki tamaam netaaon kii puri urja chunaav prachaar main hi lagi hui thi
 But from May 12 onwards, these discussions will start in the party till the results are out
 zaahir he sab kuch 16 may ko aane vaale nateezon par hi nirbhar karegaa
 Till then, many leaders can give orders to sew sherwanis for the oath

 4 January 2012: See in pictures India Tudekya Party has put you forward to improve its image? Ever since i have been given the responsibility of the party, i have ensured that we use technology wherever possible
 congress yah kah kar hamaara makhul udaati he ki ham angreji or computaron ke khilaaf hai, lekin party ke adhyaksh ne donon chijen sikh lee hai
 Today, computers are being used in our party offices
 congress kahati he ki computer angreji main hone chahie, main kahata hum ki computer hindi or urdu main hone chahie
 28 December 2011: See in pictures this is not a big change in the ideology of India Tudekya Party? It is not a change
 ek dharna he ki sapa mashiinon ke khilaaf he
 We say this to the weavers and artisans, because it results in unemployment
 ham takanic ke khilaaf nahin hai
 This is the opposite, i think about it

 main vahaan nahin gaya
 i studied engineering from Mysore
 mere tamaam saathi videsh ja rahe the, to main bhi chalaa gaya
 14 December 2011: See in pictures what is your prediction about India Today election? There is a feeling that if someone can remove Bahujan Samaj Party, it is SP
 jab basapa ne pradesh congress adhyaksh reeta bahuguna-joshi kaa ghar jala diya, to congress ne virodh tak nahin kiya
 We should get all the anti-incumbency votes
 07 disambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india todachunaav visheshgy kehete hai ki congress ke samarthan se sapa sarkaar banaaegi?agar congress samarthan karti he, to yah acha he, lekin hamen bahumat paane kaa bharosa he

In view of the negligence of the police and the administration after the incident of rape with two daughters in Bihar, the National Commission for Women, Lalitha Kumaramangalam, has said that if the Bihar government cannot provide security, resign
 mahila ayog ne apni sadsy sushamaa sahu ko maamle ke tahakikat ke liye bheja he
 Lalita Kumaramangalam said that the administration in Bihar is very poor
 ghar ke aage se yuvatiyon or bacchiyon ko hathiyaaron se dhamka kar agava kar lete hai
 Rape takes place and the administration blames the victim itself
 yah sharmnaak he

 phir ayog pradhanmantri, grahamantri or raashtrapati se milakar muljimon or ghatana ke baad gadabad karne waalon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kii maang rakhega
 He said that these incidents in Bihar have proved that the criminals there are not afraid of administration but alliances
 peedita ke saath parivaaravaalon ke liye bhi yah sadma he
 The police is blaming the character of the victim instead of immediately registering an FIR against the accused and arresting them
 yah amanviya he
 The Human Rights Commission should also take strict action
 donon maamle motihaari chemotihaari main do ladakiyon ke saath darindon ne waisi harakat kii jo ek jallaad bhi nahin kar saktaa he
 The first victim was dragged by the barons brutally on the middle road without fear, fear, and then raped her one by one

 Sri Lankan offensive opener batsman Tillakaratne Dilshan also completed 10,000 runs in ODI cricket during his 62 runs innings in the ongoing One Day International match against Pakistan at Hambantota
 iske saath hi dilashaan vanade maichon main 10,000 ran or 100 wicket lene vaale duniya ke paanchaven khilaadi ban gaye hai
 It is a different matter that the record of scoring the fastest 10,000 runs is in the name of Sachin Tendulkar, whom Dilshan could not break
 sachin ke naam he recorddilashaan ne ab tak 319 maichon kii 293 pariyon main kul 10,007 ran banaae hai
 Let us tell you that the record of scoring 10,000 runs in the lowest innings in odis is in the name of Master Blaster Sachin Tendulkar

 -input: bhashaa The decision to sell (privatize) government companies is serious
 yah mishrit arthvyavastha kii niti se peeche hatana he
 Selling government undertakings will bring some resources to the budget, but it is like selling a house to pay the vegetable bill
 behad durbhagyapurna he ki sarkaar air india or indian airlines ko bechney kii soch rahi he
 i can never imagine that the airlines that carry our flag in the world will be sold
 "yadi aapako lagata he ki yah kisi commered kaa bhaashan he to chaunkane ke liye taiyaar ho jaaie

 There is Narasimha Rao who was not only the founder of Indian economic reforms but also the policy of selling the government's stake in public sector companies
 yah bhaashan vaajapeyi sarkaar kii nijeekaran niti ke khilaaf tha jo unhone bangaluru main congress adhiveshan (march 2001) ke liye taiyaar kiya tha
 The speech could not be done, but during the session, he had expressed deep anger against the Vajpayee government's policy on privatization in discussions with Jairam Ramesh
 ramesh kii kitaab tu da bink and back—indiaj 1991 story main yah sansmaran or bhaashannuma aalekh sankalit he
 Narasimha Rao's requests for government undertakings also tied the Manmohan government for ten years
 ab jabaki modi sarkaar main bhi ghate main aakanth duube dak vibhaag ko pement bank main badla ja rahaa he yaa steel sahit kuch kshetron main nae saarvajanik upkram ban rahe hai to maananaa padegaa ki sarkari companiyon ko lekar bhartiya netaaon kaa prem aarthik tarkon hi nahin, daleey simaaon se bhi pare he
 The government not only runs banks, hotels, power houses, but also manufactures steel, chemicals, fertilizers, three wheelers, and that too at a loss
 sarkaar ke paas 290 companiyaan hai, jo 41 kendriya mantralayon ke maatahat hai
 Banks are in addition to these
 234 companiyaan kaam kar rahi hai jabaki 56 nirmaanadhin hai
 17 in active 234 government companies
 4 lakh karod ru
 Public funds of Rs
 inkaa kul utpaadan 20
 6 lakh crore Rs
 he
 There are 71 undertakings in the active companies
 saarvajanik upakramon se milane vaala kul laabh kareeb 1,46,164 karod ru
 This means that the return on the capital invested in them is almost as much as the interest the government pays on the loans
 saarvajanik upakramon kaa do-tihaai munafa koyala, tel, bijli utpaadan va vitaran se aata he jahaan sarkaar kaa ekadhikaar yani monopali he yaa phir un kshetron se, jahaan nijee pratispardhaa aane se pehle hi sarkari companiyon ko pramukh prakritik sansaadhan yaa bazaar kaa bada hissaa saste main yaa muft mil chukaa tha
 The total loss to psus is Rs 1,19,230 crore
 he
 If banks mix fresh deficits and stranded debts, the numbers start to scare
 863 sarkari companiyaan rajyon main hai jinamein 215 ghate main hai
 When we know that the total market value of private sector HDFC bank is more than a dozen government banks or the market price of Reliance Industries is more than Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, GAIL and Hindustan Petroleum, then make the government companies on economic scale Placing does not constitute a convincing argument
 sarkari companiyon main maheenon khaali rahane vaale ucch pad yah bataate hai ki inaki prashasnic saaj-sambhaal bhi mushkil he
 Employment arguments are also not sustainable
 rojgaar bazaar main sangathit kshetra (sarkari or nijee) kaa hissaa keval chah fisadi he
 only 1
 76 karod log sarkari kshetra main the, jinamein 13
 5 lakh people are in government companies
 vinievesh va nijeekaran se rojgaar nahin gata, yah pichley prayogon ne sabit kiya he
 Despite these facts and the Modi government, which has awakened the minimum government in its election speeches, starts building new public enterprises
 jaise dak vibhaag ke pement bank ko hi len
 In 2015, the postal department posted a 14 per cent deficit to Rs 6,259 crore
 pahunch gaya
 Post offices providing deposit withdrawal facility by opening an account have long been working like a payment bank
 keval karj nahin miltaa jo ki nae pement bank bhi nahin de sakate
 Government banks are in disarray and private companies are returning payment bank licenses
 jab bhavishya ke vittiya lenden bank shakhaon se nahin balki atm mobile or online se hone vaale hon, aise main dak vibhaag main 800 karod ru
 The idea of creating a new bank by investing capital of Rs
 asangati tab or bad jaati he jab niti ayog air india sahit sarkari companiyon ke vinievesh ke sujhaavon par kaam kar rahaa he
 The urges to keep the government in business are not economic or employable but political
 satta ke vikendrikaran or swatantra niamakon ke ubharne ke saath rajanetaaon ke liye vivekadhin faislon kii jagah simit ho chali he
 In this era of shrinking of rights, only government companies are left which give the basis for the dominionist aspirations of politics which also has enough scope for corruption
 yahi vajah he ki bharat ko aarthik sudhaar dene vaale narsingh raav nijeekaran ko paap bataate hue milte hai
 Manmohan Singh is not able to disinvest psus in ten years of governance, while the hero of the private sector hopes Narendra Modi becomes the new pioneer of government companies
 pradhanmantriyon kii is suchi main keval gathjod kii sarkaar chalaane vaale atal bihari vaajapeyi hi saahsee dikhte the
 He made a policy of privatization and with the privatization of about 28 companies, it proved that running a hotel or making bread is not the government's job
 saarvajanik companiyon main nagarikon kaa paisa laga he
 When these companies are in loss, it is in principle a loss of national assets
 jaisaa ki sarkari bainkon main dikh rahaa he jahaan bajet se gaya paisa bhi dub rahaa he or jamakartaon kaa dhan bhi lekin agar yah nuksaan rajnatik prabhutv ke kaam aata ho to kise phikr hogi? hamen yah maan lenaa chahie ki sarkari companiyon ko banaae rakhane ke aagrah daleey baadhaaen todakar bhartiya raajnneeti kaa sanskaar ban chuke hai, jisase jaldi mukti ab naammumkin he

 But now you can watch why she thinks @narendramodi should win
 Her reasons are based on an ordinary person's gut feeling
 Her last lines here, "even if there were ten hands, she would have voted for him" is the clincher

 Edward Snowden, who leaked US intelligence information, refused to be assured by a Norwegian court that he would not be extradited if he traveled to the country to receive an award in November
 america kii vyapak khufia suchanaaen li karne ke baad snowden 2013 se rus main nirvaasan main rah rahe hai
 Snowden filed a civil suit against Norway's Ministry of Justice in April
 yah mukadmaa isliye tha taaki mantralay ko agrim main iske liye roka ja sake ki vah kisi pratyrpan anurodh par karrwai nahin kare
 The Norway branch of PEN has invited Snowden to receive the Ositzki Prize for Freedom of Speech on 18 November
 haalanki snowden ko dar he ki yadi unhone norge kii yatra kii to unhen america pratyrpit kiya ja saktaa he
 The comments oslo kii adaalat ne unka anurodh khaarij kar diya
 The court upheld the Ministry of Justice's plea that the basis of any extradition cannot be evaluated until it is actually produced
 iskaa matlab he ki snowden ko america pratyrpit karnaa he yaa nahin is bare main norge tabhi nirnay kar saktaa he jab america usase snowden ko pratyrpit karne kii maang kare

 Sanjay Singh, the newly elected Rajya Sabha MP of Aam Aadmi Party from Delhi, has been trying to do something different or new every day since he has come to Parliament, so that he remains in the headlines
 sanjay singh ne elaan kiya he ki agar ve sansad main kaam nahin karenge to sansad se vetan bhatta bhi nahin lenge
 Sanjay Singh has written a letter to Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu, saying that the issues of public during the session should be discussed in the Supreme House of the country
 chaatro, kisaanon, vyapaariyon ko hamase apeksha hoti he ki hamaara sadan unke muddon par charchaa karke unke muddon kaa samaadhaan karegaa
 But for the last three days, there is no action in the House
 aise main bina kaam ke janata ke paison se kaarywahi ke din kaa vetan lenaa sarvatha anuchit he
 Therefore, you are requested not to give allowance for the day on which the House is not processed
 sanjay singh ne bataaya ki unhone buudhvaar ko sadan main yuvaaon or mahilaon se sambandhit do prashn lagaae the lekin kuch nahin ho sakaa
 The comments sanjay singh kii tarj par aam aadmi party ke do or rajyasabha saansad narayan das gupta or susheel gupta ne bhi elaan kiya ki jis din kaarywahi nahin hogi ve us din kaa vetan bhatta nahin lenge

 teenon saansadon ne sabhapati mahoday ko patr likhakar ye anurodh kiya he
 Aam Aadmi Party mps believe that the farmers, students and the common man of the country are confident that their elected representatives will discuss their issues in the House and Parliament will find a solution to those issues, but it is sad to see that the three Everything has come to a standstill in Parliament since day one
 sanjay singh ne rajyasabha ke sabhapati venkaiya naidu ko chitthee likhakar kaha he ki 'desh ke sarvocch sadan main satr ke dauraan ke janata ke muddon par charchaa honi chahie
 Students, farmers, businessmen expect from us that our House will discuss their issues and resolve their issues
 lekin pichley teen din se sadan main koi kaarywahi nahi ho rahi he
 In such a situation, it is completely inappropriate to take salary on the day of action from public money without work
 atah aapse anurodh he jis din bhi sadan kii kaarywahi naa ho us din kaa bhatta naa diya jaae'
 Sanjay Singh said that he had raised two questions related to youth and women in the House on Wednesday but nothing could be done

 BJP in Goa seems to have postponed the crisis for the time being
 pehle khabar ye ai thi ki goa main bijepi manohar parrikar kii jagah kendra main mantri shripad nayak ko bheja jayega
 But the BJP leadership could not muster the courage because the bjp's ally Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party and Goa People's Party in Goa had categorically denied that they supported Manohar Parrikar and not BJP
 aise halaat main ab bijepi alaakaman ne yah tay kiya he ki manohar parrikar mukhyamantri hi bane rahenge or kuch mantriyon ko hataa kar do nae chehre laae gaye hai
 Milind Nayak and Nilesh Kabral have been made ministers in Goa
 darasal, goa main bijepi ke liye ajeeb halaat paidaa ho gaye hai
 Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar himself is ill and admitted to AIIMS in Delhi where his pancreas is being treated
 parrikar ke alaava bijepi ke do or mantri kaaphi biimaar hai
 Padurang Madgaikar and Francis d'souza are also not well
 ek america main hai to duusare mumbai main ilaaj kara rahe hai or kisi bhi haalat main vidhansabha voting ke liye nahin aa sakate the
 In such a situation, the BJP felt that if a new Chief Minister is made, it would have to get a confidence vote for the majority, which the BJP did not want to risk
 duusari taraf goa main bijepi kii sahyogi goa farravad party ke vijay saradesai lagaataar dabaab banaae ja rahe the ki manohar parrikar kii anupasthiti main goa sarkaar kaa kaamkaaj prabhavit ho rahaa he
 In such a situation, the pressure was increasing to decide anything for the BJP high command
 kai naamon par charchaa hui shripad nayak ke alaava goa vidhansabha adhyaksh pramod saavant ke naam kii bhi charchaa hui magar baat nahin ban pai
 Considering the situation, the Congress also played its part
 The Congress, which has 16 mlas and also has the support of an NCP MLA, staked a claim to form the government and demanded a session of the Assembly
 aise main bijepi par lagaataar dabaab banataa ja rahaa tha
 The bjp's dilemma was that they could not make a new chief minister
 duusari ore parrikar kii haalat thik nahin thi party ke paas vikalp kam hote ja rahe the
 In such a situation, the BJP felt that in view of the political situation that is going on in Goa, it will not be right to tamper there and two new faces have been brought in place of two ministers
 magar kya yah sachmuch main samaadhaan he
 The comments goa kii raajnneeti par najar rakhanevaalon ko lagata he ki yah samaadhaan nahin he haa sankat ko philhal taalane kii koshish kii gai he, kyonki sabase bada sawaal he ki yadi parrikar thik ho jate hai to koi samasya nahin he magar unki tabiyat yadi nahin sudharti he to bijepi ke paas kya vikalp hoga tab to unhen us samasya se nibatane kii hogi jise wo philhal taal gaye hai
 BJP still faces allegations that they did not respect the mandate of the public, despite being the number two party, they formed the government and the Congress which was the number one party was not given a chance to prove its majority, while Yeddyurappa in Karnataka Being the largest party was given a chance to prove majority
 haalanki ye or baat he ki yediurppa apana bahumat sabit nahin kar sake
 But this formula was not implemented in Goa
 ab kisi tarah sarkaar to bijepi ne bachaa lee magar abhi ek sawalia nishaan laga hua he is sarkaar par ki aage kya hoga kyonki yahaan party se bada vyakti he jiske aasapaas goa bijepi kii raajnneeti gum rahi he
