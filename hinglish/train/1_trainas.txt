 This can make Narendra Modi's supporters happy
 samajha jaataa he ki endie ko kul vot pratishat kaa 36 pratishat milegaa, jabaki upie ko 22 pratishat tathaa anya ko 42 pratishat
 While Congress got 206 seats in 2009, this time it is likely to get only 89 seats, because the party's performance in the entire country is falling
 masalan andhra pradesh jahaan pichhali baar party ko jabardast safalataa mili thi or 33 siten bhi mili thim vahaan is baar party ko mahaj 6 siten milengi

 Most girls think that they have invested a lot to pursue this relationship

 com / en1zl7igze Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has made it clear that despite the criticisms of his two allies RJD and Congress, he will support the rival BJP candidate in the presidential election
 nitish ne bijepi ummidavaar ke khilaaf vipaksh ke saajha ummidavaar khadaa karne ke prastaav ke khilaaf jaakar hue ghoshnaa kar di ki unki party jediu raashtrapati chunaav main ramnath kovind kaa samarthan karegi, jo pichley hafte tak bihar ke rajyapal ke pad par the
 The RJD of Congress and Lalu Prasad Yadav, jdu's partner parties in Bihar's Grand Alliance government, expressed their unhappiness about this
 lalu ne to nitish ke faisle ko 'aitihaasik bhul' tak qaraar diya
 But bypassing his criticisms, Nitish made it clear that he stood by his decision
 unhone kaha, mahagathbandhan bihar tak hi simit he, isliye iske ghatak dal rashtriya muddon par apana (alag) stand tay karne ke liye swatantra hai
 Nitish Kumar was referring to an old statement by CP Joshi, a senior Congress leader
 2015 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle seepi joshi ne aisa hi bayaan diya tha, jab unase sawaal kiya gaya tha ki teenon dal (congress, argedy or jediu) ahm muddon par apane virodhon ko kaise darkinar kar paaenge
 On July 17, Congress and RJD chief Lalu Yadav worked with the Left parties on a proposal to convince 17 parties, including their own parties, to make former Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar the opposition candidate for the presidency
 haalanki iskaa nateeja sifer hi rahaa
 The BJP and its allies have garnered 63 per cent of the votes for the presidential election by gaining the support of regional parties
 nitish ke vipaksh kaa saath chhodane ke baad tasviir or saaf ho gai
 Nitish cited the reason for Kovind's support as the Governor of Bihar and acted without bias
 unhone kaha ki ek aise vyakti kaa samarthan karne main unhen garv mahasoos ho rahaa he, jiskaa bihar se gaharaa naata rahaa he
 Nitish's argument is in response to Lalu's plea in which he has repeatedly called Meera Kumar as 'bihar's daughter'
 mira kumaar paanch baar saansad rah chuki hai or vah purv uppradhanmantri jagjivan ram kii beti hai
 Like Kovind, he too is a Dalit, which is why opposition leaders like Mayawati and Sharad Pawar did not support the BJP candidate
 nitish ne mira kumaar ko ummidavaar banaae jane par kaha, 'kya bihar kii beti ko haarane ke liye chunaa gaya he?' unhone sawalia lahaze main kaha ki kya yah vahi ranneeti he, jo vipaksh 2019 ke chunaavon ke liye akhriyaar karegaa
 However, Nitish, Congress and Lalu have all insisted that the presidential election clash is not going to affect the alliance in Bihar
 nitish kumaar ne saal 2013 main narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiye jane ke baad bijepi se 17 saal purana rishta tod liya tha
 But for some time, the two leaders have expressed their support on each other's two most important decisions
 piem modi ne bihar main sharabbandi ke nitish ke faisle kii saraahna kii to nitish ne pradhanmantri ke notebandi ke nirnay kaa khulkar samarthan kiya
 Now Nitish has indicated that he has forgotten his old hatred of PM Modi
 vah apane sahyogi dalon ke gusse se darane vaale nahin hai
 If Nitish decides to break the ties with his current allies, then in such a situation the BJP has enough mlas, on whose own strength he can remain the Chief Minister
 aisi sthiti main yah to saaf he ki lalu yaa congress donon main se koi bhi gathbandhan kaa ant nahin chahenge
 Investigations are going on against Lalu's family members (two of his sons are ministers in the Bihar government) in corruption cases and they will get some help in fighting the case on the basis of political power
 vahiin maujuuda samay main congress ke paas gine-chune hi rajya hai, jahaan vah satta main shaamil he, isliye vah nahin chaahegi ki uske haath se koi rajya chhin jaae
 Lalu's son and Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav has said that it is wrong to assume in advance that the opposition will be defeated in the presidential election
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki chunavi ladaai vichaardhaara ko lekar he

 Last evening, Nitish Kumar attended an iftar party organized by Lalu Yadav
 donon agal- bagal hi baithe the or mukhyamantri ke vidaa hone se pehle donon gale bhi mili
 It may have been an attempt to reduce the distance created by the presidential election
 bihar kii mahagathbandhan sarkaar main jediu kii sahyogi partiyon - congress or lalu prasad yadav kii argedy ne ise lekar saaf taur par apni nakhushi jaahir kii
 Lalu even termed Nitish's decision as a 'historic mistake'
 lekin apni aalochanaon ko darkinar karte hue nitish ne saaf kar diya ki vah apane faisle par kaayam hai
 He said, the Grand Alliance is confined to Bihar, so its constituents are free to decide their (separate) stand on national issues
 nitish kumaar darasal congress ke ek varisht netaa seepi joshi ke ek puraane bayaan kaa zikr kar rahe the
 CP Joshi made a similar statement before the 2015 Bihar assembly elections when he was asked how the three parties (congress, RJD and JDU) would be able to bypass their protests on important issues
 congress or argedy pramukh lalu yadav ne 17 july ko vam dalon ke saath milakar purv loksabhaa spikar mira kumaar ko raashtrapati pad ke liye vipaksh kaa ummidavaar banane ke vaaste apni partiyon samet 17 dalon ko manaane ke prastaav par kaam kiya tha
 However, the result was the cipher
 bijepi or iske sahyogi dalon ne kshetreey partiyon kaa samarthan hasil kar raashtrapati chunaav ke liye 63 fisadi voton kaa jugad kar liya he
 The picture became clearer after Nitish left the opposition
 nitish ne kovind ke samarthan kii vajah bataate hue kaha ki bihar ke rajyapal ke rup main unhone bina kisi pakshpaat ke kaam kiya
 He said that he is proud to support a person who has a deep connection with Bihar
 nitish kaa yah tark lalu ke us daleel ke jawaab main he, jisamen vah baar-baar mira kumaar ko 'bihar kii beti' bataate rahe hai
 Meira Kumar has been a five-time MP and is the daughter of former Deputy Prime Minister Jagjivan Ram
 kovind kii tarah vah bhi dalit hai, isi vajah se mayawati or sharad pavaar jaise vipakshi netaaon ne bijepi ummidavaar ko samarthan nahin diya
 On making Meira Kumar a candidate, Nitish said, 'has Bihar's daughter been chosen to lose?' He asked in question that whether this is the same strategy that the opposition will take for the 2019 elections
 haalanki nitish, congress or lalu sabhi ne jor dekar kaha he ki raashtrapati chunaav main takaraav kaa bihar main gathbandhan par asar nahin padane ja rahaa he
 Nitish Kumar broke a 17-year-old relationship with BJP in 2013 after Narendra Modi was declared the prime ministerial candidate
 lekin beete kuch samay se donon netaaon ne ek-duusare ke do sabase ahm faislon par apana samarthan vyakt kiya tha
 While PM Modi praised Nitish's decision to ban liquor in Bihar, Nitish openly supported the Prime Minister's decision of demonetisation
 ab nitish ne yah sanket de diya he ki vah piem modi se apane puraane bair ko bhula chuke hai
 He is not afraid of the anger of his allies
 agar nitish apane maujuuda saathiyon se rishta todane kaa faisla karte hai, to aisi sthiti main bijepi ke paas paryaapt vidhayak hai, jinke dam par vah mukhyamantri bane rah sakate hai
 In such a situation, it is clear that either Lalu or Congress will not want the end of the alliance
 bhrashtachar ke maamalon main lalu ke parivaar ke sadasyon (unke do bete bihar sarkaar main mantri hai) ke khilaaf jaanch chal rahi he or raajnneetik satta ke dam par unhen cese ladane main kuch to madad milegi
 At the same time, the Congress has only a few states where it is in power, so it will not want any state to be snatched away from its hands
 lalu ke bete or bihar ke upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ne kaha he ki pehle se yah maan lenaa ki raashtrapati chunaav main vipaksh kii haar hogi, galat he
 He also said that the electoral battle is about ideology
 unhone apane pita ke rukh ko doharaate hue kaha ki bijepi ke 'fasiwad' ke khilaaf ladane ke liye vipakshi dalon ko aage aana jaruri he
 The comments haalanki nitish ke karibiyon kaa kahana he ki darasal yah lalu yadav or anya log hai, jo bijepi ke asli makasad ko samarthan de rahe hai
 It is further clarified that Meera Kumar is a Jatav Dalit, while Ramnath Kovind is a non-jatav Dalit
 yah wo tabaka he jise bijepi lubhaane main safal rahi he
 He says that the BJP has indicated that it is supporting a sub-group of Dalits who are inclined towards it, while the opposition has made a mistake by contesting from a competitive sub-caste
 beete shaam ko nitish kumaar ne lalu yadav dwaara yojit kii gai iftaar party main shirkat kii
 Both were seated side-by-side and both hugged before the Chief Minister left
 ho saktaa he yah raashtrapati chunaav ko lekar paidaa hui duuri ko kam karne kaa prayaas rahaa ho
 On July 17, Congress and RJD chief Lalu Yadav worked with the Left parties on a proposal to convince 17 parties, including their own parties, to make former Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar the opposition candidate for the presidency
 haalanki iskaa nateeja sifer hi rahaa
 The BJP and its allies have garnered 63 per cent of the votes for the presidential election by gaining the support of regional parties
 nitish ke vipaksh kaa saath chhodane ke baad tasviir or saaf ho gai
 Nitish cited the reason for Kovind's support as the Governor of Bihar and acted without bias
 unhone kaha ki ek aise vyakti kaa samarthan karne main unhen garv mahasoos ho rahaa he, jiskaa bihar se gaharaa naata rahaa he
 Nitish's argument is in response to Lalu's plea in which he has repeatedly called Meera Kumar as 'bihar's daughter'
 mira kumaar paanch baar saansad rah chuki hai or vah purv uppradhanmantri jagjivan ram kii beti hai
 Like Kovind, he too is a Dalit, which is why opposition leaders like Mayawati and Sharad Pawar did not support the BJP candidate
 nitish ne mira kumaar ko ummidavaar banaae jane par kaha, 'kya bihar kii beti ko haarane ke liye chunaa gaya he?' unhone sawalia lahaze main kaha ki kya yah vahi ranneeti he, jo vipaksh 2019 ke chunaavon ke liye akhriyaar karegaa
 However, Nitish, Congress and Lalu have all insisted that the presidential election clash is not going to affect the alliance in Bihar
 nitish kumaar ne saal 2013 main narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiye jane ke baad bijepi se 17 saal purana rishta tod liya tha
 But for some time, the two leaders have expressed their support on each other's two most important decisions
 piem modi ne bihar main sharabbandi ke nitish ke faisle kii saraahna kii to nitish ne pradhanmantri ke notebandi ke nirnay kaa khulkar samarthan kiya
 Now Nitish has indicated that he has forgotten his old hatred of PM Modi
 vah apane sahyogi dalon ke gusse se darane vaale nahin hai
 If Nitish decides to break the ties with his current allies, then in such a situation the BJP has enough mlas, on whose own strength he can remain the Chief Minister
 aisi sthiti main yah to saaf he ki lalu yaa congress donon main se koi bhi gathbandhan kaa ant nahin chahenge
 Investigations are going on against Lalu's family members (two of his sons are ministers in the Bihar government) in corruption cases and they will get some help in fighting the case on the basis of political power
 vahiin maujuuda samay main congress ke paas gine-chune hi rajya hai, jahaan vah satta main shaamil he, isliye vah nahin chaahegi ki uske haath se koi rajya chhin jaae
 Lalu's son and Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav has said that it is wrong to assume in advance that the opposition will be defeated in the presidential election
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki chunavi ladaai vichaardhaara ko lekar he
 He reiterated his father's stance, saying that to fight against bjp's 'fascism', opposition parties must come forward
 tippaniyan However, Nitish's close people say that it is actually Lalu Yadav and others who are supporting the real cause of the BJP

 aise main inhen dhaaraon ke tahat siem shivaraj par bhi karrwai ho
 Let me tell you that this is not the first case when the video of Shivraj behaving indecently with a bodyguard has gone viral

 He said that if India talks of repeating the Bangladesh war, it should not forget the war of Kargil

 Citizenship Amendment Bill was passed on Tuesday after a huge deadlock in Parliament
 ab rajyasabha main is par bahes jari he
 Know how a bill takes the form of a law after it is passed in the Rajya Sabha
 koi bill ek puri prakriya se taiyaar hokar phir is tarah paas hokar naye kanoon kaa rup letaa he
 But, there is also a question whether it is possible that despite passing a bill in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, it does not take the form of law
 lekin, itihaas ke pannon ko khangaalen to desh main ek bill ke saath aisa bhi hua he
 What is a bill? First act is brought to form a new law or to replace an old law
 pehle charan main naye kanoon ko banane ke liye mukhya prastaav, suzav yaa puraane kanoon main badlaav ke prastaav yaa suzav laaye jate hai
 a bill is a kind of proposal, it has to go through three stages to get it into law
 vidheyak ko kanoon banane ke liye 5 charnon se guzarana hota he
 In the first three phases, the Bill is discussed in both the Houses of Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha
 yahaan charchaa ke baad vidheyak ko standing cameti ke paas bheja jaataa he
 In the fourth phase, the Bill is passed in a joint sitting of the two Houses
 vidheyak ke aakhri yani paanchave charan main ise raashtrapati ke paas bheja jaataa he
 Then the bill takes the form of law only after the President's seal
 niyam ke anusaar agar raashtrapati chaahe to apni vito power kaa istemaal karke ise lataka saktaa he
 After the discussion, after the discussion on the voting legislation, a vote is taken on questions and amendments
 phir vidheyak par charchaa shuru hoti he
 Then the questions raised on it are kept in the House for votes
 phir sadan main paas hone ke baad bill ko aadhikarik rajptr ke taur par publish kiya jaataa he
 It can be published only with the permission of the speaker
 charchaa ke baad vidheyak main sanshodhan ke suzav ko shaamil kiya jaataa he iske baad vidheyak ko standing cameti main bheja jaataa he
 In the last phase, the Director of the officer examines the bill and prepares a report on it
 stanging cameti vidheyak par visheshgyon se raay lekar sujhaavon ko vidheyak main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Exactly the same process takes place in Rajya Sabha
 raashtrapati kii muhar jarurirajyasabha main bill paas hone ke baad isamen raashtrapati kii muhar laganaa jaruri he
 Only then does a bill or a bill take the form of law
 ye donon sadanon kii saajha baithak ke baad hi raashtrapati ke paas bheja jaataa he
 The bill takes the form of law only after the President is approved, then it is applicable in the whole country
 jab is raashtrapati ne nahin kiya tha hastaksharsaal 1984 main pradhanmantri indira gandhi kii hatya kar di gai thi
 After Operation Blue Star, the atmosphere against him in the country had deteriorated considerably
 aise main desh ke pehle sikh raashtrapati gyani gel singh par istipha dene kaa dabaav bad rahaa tha
 He was extremely angry with Indira Gandhi
 gyani gel singh ko unke samarthakon ne samajhaayaa ki aise vakt main ye agar siyaasi kadam uthaane se sikhon or gairsikhon ke bich kii phank or gahari ho jaaegi
 He still went to the Golden Temple
 iske baad indira gandhi ko 31 oktober ko unke apane hi suraksha daste ke do javaanon (jo dharm se sikh the) ne goli maar di thi
 At that time the President was on a state visit to Oman and Indira's political heir Rajiv Gandhi Pt
 bengal ke daure par the
 Rajiv Gandhi returned and without waiting for the President, the Vice President was sworn in as Prime Minister
 isse rajeev or tatkaaleen raashtrapati ke bich raajnneetik khain or bhi gahari ho gai
 With the help of a constitutional system, Giani Zail Singh started to tighten the government
 isi kadi main jab rajeev sarkaar ne rajyasabha main paas ho chukaa postal emendament bill bheja to gyani gel singh ne vito kaa istemaal kar diya
 With this power, the President can withhold any bill that has come for approval, for an indefinite period
 loksabhaa main somvaar ko khaadya suraksha bill par charchaa ke dauraan upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne ise aitihaasik kadam bataaya or sabhi dalon se apane matbhedon ko darkinar rakhte hue sarvasammati se ise paarit karaane kii apil kii
 During this, he said that the Congress had promised the Food Security Act and we are keeping our promise
 sonia gandhi ne sadan main kaha ki bharat apane nivaasiyon kii khaadya suraksha kii jimmedaari letaa he or hamaara har baccha kuposhan se mukt hokar desh kii pragati main hissaa legaa
 He said that after the introduction of this law, the disadvantaged sections and farmers of the society will benefit
 unhone kaha, 'yah sandesh dene kaa samay aa gaya he ki bharat sabhi ke liye khaadya suraksha sunishchit karne kii jimmedaari uthaa saktaa he
 Targeting political parties opposing the food security bill, Sonia Gandhi said, 'some people raise the question whether we have the (food security bill) tools for this? But the question is not about the means, we have to find the means
 log poochhate hai ki kya ye kiya ja saktaa he? sawaal ye nahin ki ham ye kar sakate hai yaa nahin, balki hamen yah karnaa hi he
 Some people raise the question whether these bills are in the interest of farmers? i want to say that this will benefit the farmers because agriculture and farmers are at the top of our policies
 'sonia gandhi ne kaha ki khaadya suraksha kanoon jaruratmandon ko shashakt banane or bhrashtachar ko kam karne kaa shashakt aadhaar banegaa
 According to him, the public distribution system needs to be reformed to make the food security law a success
 iske baad samaajawaadee party adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav lakshaman rekha khinchate hue kaha ki ve kanoon kaa samarthan karenge, lekin bina sanshodhan ke bill paas nahin hone denge
 He said that the Food Security Bill should be deferred till the discussions with the Chief Ministers of all the states
 isi ke saath sapa pramukh mulaayam singh ne yah bhi kaha ki khaadya suraksha bill se kisaanon ko nuksaan hoga
 This is only brought to the attention of elections

 The political situation of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections has started to be laid
 modi ke khilaaf jahaan vipaksh ekajute ho rahaa he to endie ke sahyogi dal bijepi ko ankhen dikhaane main jute hue hai
 After Shiv Sena, the jdu's attitude has also been criticized
 vakt kii najaakat ko samajhate hue nitish kumaar ne bijepi ke saamne aisi shart rakhi he, jiskaa puraa hona naammumkin he
 The JDU core committee met on Sunday at the home of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 is baithak ke baad jediu ne pehali baar siton ko lekar apni baat rakhi
 JDU has demanded to contest 25 Lok Sabha seats in 2019, while BJP has to give only 15 seats
 iske jediu ne tay kiya he ki rajya main endie gathbandhan kaa cheharaa bhi siem nitish kumaar hi honge
 Let us know that in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, NDA had won 31 seats in the 40 Lok Sabha seats of Bihar in the Modi wave
 endie kii 31 siton main se bijepi ko 22 siten, paswan kii algepi ko 6 or upendra kushvaha kii araspi ko 3 siten mili thim
 At the same time, Lalu Prasad Yadav's party RJD got only 4 seats, Nitish got 2 seats, Congress also got 2 seats and NCP got one
 jediu netaa ajay alok ne kaha, 'seat shering ko lekar jediu main koi kanfusion nahin he
 We were contesting on 25 seats till now and BJP on 15 seats, but now some allied parties have joined us
 to ab seat shering ko lekar senior netaa faisla karenge
 Nitish Kumar is the face of the NDA alliance in Bihar
 'there is no confusion in JD(U) regarding seat sharing
 We used to contest on 25 seats & BJP on 15 seats
 Now more allies have joined us so all top leaders will decide about the seat sharing

 lekin ab atal ke daur vaali bijepi nahin rah gai he
 If the BJP agrees to Nitish Kumar, then in such a situation, the seat of its seven mps will have to be renounced
 aise main piem narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah unki sharten maane ye mushkil he
 The BJP is also realizing this fact with Nitish Kumar's political condition
 bijepi sutron kii maane to mahaj 10 se 15 siten hi party jediu ke liye chhod sakati he
 Because there are other allies also for whom seats are to be left

 Preparations for the next Lok Sabha election and seat sharing will be discussed in this meeting
 gauratlab he ki 2013 main narendra modi ko jab pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar bijepi ne banaaya to nitish kumaar endie se naata todakar alag ho gaye the
 In such a situation, BJP came into the fray in alliance with Ram Vilas Paswan's party and Upendra Kushwaha's party
 iskaa nateeja tha ki nitish kii party jediu 2 siton par simit ho gai thi
 Later Nitish Kumar went with RJD and won the assembly elections and formed the government but now he is again with BJP
 lekin paswan or kushvaha kii party centre kii sarkaar main saajhedaar he
 There has been speculation about Kushwaha going with RJD in between

 Ram Vilas Paswan met BJP President Amit Shah on Sunday

 Control on the size of bats
 Another change that has been made this time, like ICC, is to bring the thickness of the bat and its edges under control, in addition if a batsman while taking runs, if the bat is also above the line in the crease
 If it is, it will not be given out
 no ball hone par teesraa ampire bhi bataa saktaa haimatch ke dauraan agar koi gendbaaj no ball phenkata he, to field ampire ke alaava third ampire ko bhi ye adhikaar milegaa jisamen wo riple dekhne ke baad us gend ko no ball de saktaa he
 Kumble, who is representing this committee, included many rules of MCC, said that, we have also included new rules implemented by MCC in our recommendations, including controlling the size of the bat so that a balance between the ball and the bat At the same time, we have now thoroughly investigated all the techniques on DRS

 Director Ram Gopal Varma has come again with a horror film 'bhoot Returns', this time starring Manisha Koirala, JD Chakraborty, Madhushalini and Alaena Sharma
 
 
 yah kahani he ek honted house kii, jisamen puraa parivaar saath rahane jaataa he
 
 
 And what must have happened then, you yourself are sensible
 
 
 tippaniyan 'bhoot Returns' is an hour and a half movie, ie 90 minutes, and for about 50 minutes all the characters of the film are seen playing hide and seek with the ghost
 
 
 mujhe to lagata he, ab horer filmon main yah sab kuch kam hona chahie
 
 
 For example, a servant who probably becomes the first 'bali ka Bakra' in almost all horror films from 'twenty years later' till now
 
 
 daraavnee awaazen nikaalte darvaaze, or bhoot ko dhundne ke lambe-lambe seens, jo vaise bhi kisi bhi horer film main special apiyarence main hota he, or hamaari police kii tarah aakhir main hi aata he
 
 
 Well, the best thing about producer Nitin Manmohan's film is its 3-D cinematography, due to which you will get to see amazing 3-D effects in many places
 
 
 main phir kahuunga ki actors ko film main sirf darana tha, so, acting kaa zikr karnaa bhi bekaar he
 
 
 In the end, it would be better to say that now Ramu starts putting some stories in his horror films
 
 
 so, lagbhag bina kahani kii 'bhoot riterns' ke liye meri reating he 1
 5 stars
 
 
 'bhoot riterns' dedh ghante, yani 90 minute kii film he, or kareeb 50 minute tak film ke sabhi kirdaar bhoot ke saath luka-chhipi khelte dikhte hai
 
 
 i think, now all this should be reduced in horror films
 
 
 masalan, ek naukar, jo shaayad 'bees saal baad' se lekar ab tak kii lagbhag sabhi horer filmon main sabase pehle 'bali kaa bakra' banataa he
 
 
 Doors making creepy noises, and long scenes of finding ghosts, which happen anyway in a special appearance in any horror film, and just like our police arrives at last
 
 
 khayr, nirmaataa nitin manmohan kii is film kii sabase acchhee baat he isaki 3-di cinematography, jisaki badaulat aapako kai jagah kamaal ke 3-di effects dekhne ko milenge
 
 
 i will again say that the actors were just to be scared in the film, so it is useless to mention acting
 
 
 aakhir main yahi kahuunga ki behatar hoga ki ab raamu apni horer filmon main kuch kahaniyaan bhi daalana shuru karen
 
 
 So, my rating for 'bhoot Returns' of almost untitled story is 1
 5 star

 bihar (bihar Mahagathbandhan) main siyasat kii raah bhi ab upi kii ore chal padi he
 In the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) -led mahagathbandhan in Bihar, the leaders of the mahagathbandhan were excited by the attraction of smaller parties, but now the demand of these parties has made the seat-sharing challenge in the grand alliance
 aise main uttar pradesh kii tarj par bina congress (congress) ke gathbandhan banaae jane ke kayaas lagaae jane lage hai
 According to a Congress leader, earlier it was agreed to contest 12 to 20 seats of the Congress, but after the other parties have joined the coalition gradually, now that the seat sharing has started in the coalition
 ab is gathbandhan main purv kendriya mantri upendra kushvaha ke alaava jithan ram maanjhi kaa hindustani avam morcha (ham), mukesh saahani kii vikasshil insaan party shaamil he
 Left parties are also expected to join the grand alliance, although it has not been formally announced yet
 congress sutron ke mutabik, bihar kii 40 loksabhaa siton main se congress kam se kam 16 siten maang rahi he or yah sanket bhi de rahi he ki congress kisi bhi haal main 12 se kam siton par samjhauta nahin karegi
 Following this demand from the Congress, the RJD has started work on its second formula, which does not include the Congress
 rajd sutara ne kaha ki tejasvi bina congress ke chote dalon ke saath gathbandhan ko zyada tarjeeh de rahe hai
 Sources say that talks have also been held with leaders of Upendra Kushwaha's party RLSP and Mukesh Sahni's Vikas Insan Party
 bihar kii raajnneeti ko kareeb se dekhne vaale or raajnneetik vishleshak surendra kishor kehete hai ki yah badi baat nahin hogi
 He said that excited by the results of the recent assembly elections, the Congress is demanding more seats than the RJD thought
 aise main itnaa tay he ki congress 10 seat se neeche nahin jaaegi
 Kishore says, "because of the rjd's opposition to the 10 percent upper caste reservation, the Congress will also move away from the RJD and try to give the message in the country that the RJD opposed the upper caste reservation, because of this, they parted ways
 is bahaane ko lekar rajd bhi congress se alag hokar apane votbank ko majboot karne kii baat ko lekar chunavi maidan main utregi
 "in this case, separation of Congress and RJD is not a big deal
 unhone seat bantwaare ko lekar bhi kaha ki mahagathbandhan main dalon kii sankhya adhik ho gai he, jise koi nakaar nahin saktaa
 In such a situation, no party is in a position to renounce the seat
 is bich, congress ne apane shaktipradarshan ko lekar teen farvari ko patna ke gandhi maidan main raily kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 Apart from Congress President Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi is also expected to attend this rally
 raily ko lekar congress ke netaa utsahit hai
 Senior journalist Kanhaiya Bhelari says that the seat-sharing screw in the Grand Alliance is stuck due to the Congress
 unhone kaha ki congress rashtriya party he, aise main vah sammanjanak siton se kam par samjhauta nahin kar sakati he
 RJD can work here on the strategy of Uttar Pradesh, it also cannot be denied
 bhelari bhi maanate hai ki ralospa kisi haal main chaar siton se kam par samjhauta nahin karegi
 Congress and we have our own demands
 aise main rajd ke paas congress ko chhodkar gathbandhan banane kaa alaava koi doosraa upaay nahin bachataa
 However, a senior RJD leader said on condition of anonymity, "RJD is working on its alternative plan but talks with Congress have not failed
" yah sahi he ki congress teen rajyon main vijayi hui he parantu bihar main bhi uski sthiti main sudhaar hua he, aisa nahin he
 The Congress should demand to the best of its ability
 "congress ke ek varisht netaa ne kaha ki congress ek rashtriya party he
 It should be remembered how many seats RJD won in the last Lok Sabha election
 yah vidhansabha chunaav nahin he, jahaan matadaata kshetreey dalon ko mat denge, yah loksabhaa chunaav he, jahaan matadaata rashtriya dalon ko dekhte hai
 However, there is a screw up on seats in the Grand Alliance
 yahi kaaran he ki mahagathbandhan ke netaaon ke kharmaas yani 15 janvari ke baad hone vaala seat bantwaaraa ab tak nahin hua he

 Looks shrunk vidhansabha chunaavon main kshetreey mudde zyada haaavee rahete hai, jaise mohali main rajya sarkaar dwaara lagaaya gaya property tex is baar bada mudda banegaa
 But there are also some issues under which the current ruling coalition will be successful in removing
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bhrashtachar punjab kaa sabase bada mudda he
 The chief minister's son is the deputy CM of the state and his wife MP from Bathinda, followed by his wife's brother a minister in Punjab
 yah parivaar to pehle se hi bijness main he or satta main aane ke baad se isane puure rajya par apana niyantran bana liya he
 Be it mining, transport or any other business in the state, the so-called control of this family remains
 haalanki yah bahut hi vistrut maamla he jisaki tah main jaakar koi baaten nahin karata
 Apart from this, there are five important issues which will definitely remain at the center of these elections
 1
 The power of drugspunjab has been in its movement, soil and yield
 lekin kabhi harith kranti ke liye duniya bhar main apni pahchaan banane vaala punjab aaj yuvaaon main drugs kii samasya ko lekar surkhiyon main bana hua he
 According to an AIIMS report, a total of 1 in 10 districts here
 23 karod yuva aabaadi iske chapete main he
 The state police has also registered 14,483 firs related to it
 in chunaavon main aam aadmi party or congress donon hi is mudde ko apana ahm hathiyaar banane kii taiyaari main he
 2
 daliton se judi samasyaayein32 fisadi se saath punjab main dalit votaron kii sankhya desh main sarvaadhik hai
 During the elections, all the parties are enticing them in their own way
 in daliton par atyaachaar, naukari or is varg ke jameen kaa tukdaa paane kii koshishon main hone vaali pareshaani inase jude bade mudde hai
 The Congress and the Akali have not yet clarified their stand on the issues related to them, whereas the Aam Aadmi Party has even announced to investigate the atrocities on them and make them the Deputy Chief Minister from this class
 3
 Law and order The state's law and order worsened during the akali-bjp coalition government
 kabhi aatank se grasit rahaa yah rajya aaj aparaadhiyon ke guton se trast he
 Today, more than 400 gangsters of around 57 major criminal gangs are disrupting the law and order situation of the state
 iske alaava yahaan kii jelon main bhi 500 se adhik bade apradhi band hai
 a few days ago, Patiala's attempts to abscond from breaking Nabha jail makes the situation even more thoughtful here
 4
 According to unemployment 2015 data, there were 3,61,299 applications pending for unemployed in employment offices in Punjab
 lekin ye aankade punjab kii sahi sthiti ko nahin darshaate kyonki kam shikshit athwa anpadh implayament exange main register nahin karaate
 According to the National Sample Survey Organization, the exact number of unemployed is 5
5 million
 inamen se 72 fisadi shikshit jabaki 22 fisadi takneekee rup se kushal hai
 According to 2015-16 data, there are 60 unemployed people per thousand which is equal to the situation in Bihar
 congress or aam aadmi party ne yuva votaron ko rijhaane ke liye yahaan naukari or berogari bhatta dene kii ghoshnaa kii he
 5
 kisaanon kii aatmahatyapichley dinon kisaanon kii aatmahatya punjab main aam ho gai
 Punjab is an agro-based state
 yahaan kii 50 fisadi aabaadi isse judi hui he lekin rajya ke sakal gharelu utpaada main iskaa yogadan ghat kar 28 fisadi rah gaya he, isamen se 9 fisadi deyari kaa ansh he
 Due to being an agro-based state, agro processing units need to be set up on a large scale, but lack of raw materials is a hindrance
 fasalon kii sahi upaj na hone kii vajah se karj main duube kisaanon ne apane jivan ko hi samaapt karne kaa faisla le liya
 69,355 crores of debt owed by farmers to banks and debtors
 karj main dubi rajya sarkaar unhen muaavja dene kii sthiti main nahin he
 The meaning is clear, empty treasures and farmer suicides will no doubt play the biggest role in these elections

 12:04 AM Myanmar: PM Modi will visit Shah Bahadur Zafar's tomb today chaar saal pehle jaili been prakaran vivaad bana tha or ab vaisalin vivaad shuru ho gaya kyonki bharat or england ke bich kal duusare test ke dauraan vivies lakshmana par diares main hot spot takanic se chhedchhad karne ke liye balle par vaisalin lagane kaa aarope laga tha
 Laxman was unbeaten by the third umpire in the review of the umpires' decisions taken by England in the first session on Saturday
 jiske baad england ke purv captain maaikel vaan ne twit kiya, kya balle par lagi vaisalin ne lakshmana ko bachaa liya
 This Indian batsman had scored 27 runs and the team was losing 48 for one when the ball went from close to his bat in the ninth over of James Anderson
 anderson samet england ke sabhi khilaadiyon ne stump ke peeche kaich liye jane kii apil kii or sabhi maidan par ikatthe ho gaye
 But umpire Asad Rauf gave the verdict in favor of Laxman after which England captain Andrew Strauss asked for the use of DRS but it did not help the hosts
 kevin petersan or lakshmana ke bich ise lekar thodi kahasuni bhi ho gayi or baad main tej gendbaaj stuart broad ne patrakaron se kaha ki unki team ko puraa bharosa tha ki gend balle se lagi thi
 "players feel that the hot spots sometimes don't seem to have a slight confrontation," Brad said
 yah iskaa ek nuksaan bhi he
 But the controversy started when Vann accused Laxman on the tweet because Vaseline and no such fluid could be seen on the bat with the hot spot technique
 broad ne to had kar di or unhone jaakar lakshmana kaa balla bhi check kiya ki us par kisi tarah kii vaisalin yaa taral padaarth to nahin lagaaya hua
 He said, i thought that the ball was hit by his bat
 lekin balle par koi vaisalin yaa taral padaarth nahin tha
 No light touch is detected in the hot spot
 yah duusari baar he jab donon deshon ke bich test maichon ke dauraan vaisalin se vivaad khadaa hua ho
 The 100th Test was played at Lord's between the two countries last week
 england ne 1976-77 main bharat kaa daura kiya tha, tab bhartiya captain bishan singh bedi ne england ke tej gendbaaj jaan liver par dilli test main swing hasil karne ke liye vaisalin ke istemaal kaa aarope lagaaya tha jinhone apane aagaaj test main 46 ran dekar saat or 24 ran dekar teen wicket praapt kiye the

 vivekne kaha ki vah divyanka ke saath kaam karnaa nahin chaahate
 He said, 'I also talked about this with Divyavinka, he also believes that he is also not in favor of working together

 Police is collecting information about this from the bank
 atm ke saath main hi maujuud ek dukaan ko bhi choron ne apana nishaanaa banaaya

 At the launch of the company's new Bolt car, the head of the company's passenger vehicles sales division in South and East India said, "by 2020 we have a strong range of new cars and we market two new cars annually
 Take it down
 ' The company said that the Zest car produced at its Pune and Ranjangaon plants in Maharashtra has been booked for 3,000-4,000
 jest car ke petrol or dijal sanskarnon main graahakon kii samaan dilchaspee rahi
 He said, 'we have sold about 4,000 cars in the hatchback category and 6,500 cars in the sedan category every month
 ' According to Dhar, after the introduction of the new sedan, the company's market share increased to 12 percent as against the earlier seven percent
 company kii hazbek shrenee main bazaar hissedari 4
 5 percent
 company kii nai praudyogiki par aadhaarit car bazaar main utaarne ke saath bazaar hissedari badhaane kii yojana he
 With this, the company is keen to establish its premier budget car Nano as an influential vehicle
 naino car kii bikri par jawaab dete hue dhar ne kaha, 'ham abhi bhi har maheene 2,000 se 2,500 naino car utpaadit kar rahe hai
 However this is below our expectations as some of our products are coming to market soon
 ' The Chief Lokayukta of Chhattisgarh has remarked that no government scheme in the country is corruption free
 vidhansabha main mukhyamantri raman singh dwaara pesh chhattigasadh lok ayog ke navam vaarshik prativedan main rajya ke pramukh lokayukta nyaayamurti elsi bhadu ne tippanee kii he ki bharat main udyog, saadhan sampannataa, aarthik unnati main vruddhi ke saath hi bhrashtachar main bhi badhotaree hui he
 Even after continuous action against corruption, this problem is increasing day by day
 bhadu ne kaha he ki varsh 2011 main centre str par evam rajya str par bhrashtachar, akarmanyata, pad durupyog aadi ke asankhya maamle saamne aae hai
 2G spectrum, for example, corruption in organizing Asian Games and issuing various types of mining leases, government land allocation, schemes by the Government of India and the state government in public interest such as MNREGA, Prime Minister's Road Scheme and all the schemes of forest area Have also come to light
 yah kahana atishyokti nahin hogi ki is samay koi bhi sarkari yojana bhrashtachar rahit nahin he
 He has said that the Lokayukta has been constituted in the states to curb corruption, but due to lack of proper effective provisions in the Lokayukta Acts, the Lokayukta organizations not providing the desired facilities, infrastructure and investigative agencies, the Lokayukta is in line with the public's hope Organizations have also been unable to function effectively
 bhadu ne apni tippanee main kaha he ki jab bhrashtachar ne vikaraal rup dhaaran kar liya to janasevak anna hajaare lokapal ke gathan ke liye aawaaj uthaai or apni maang ke samarthan main bhukh hadtaal par baithe, to anayas hi bharat ke kone kone se iske samarthan main vibhinn prakaar ke pradarshan upwas ityadi kaa jan sailaab umad padaa
 After assessing its seriousness, a joint committee was formed by the Central Government by issuing a notification to draft the Lokpal bill
 bhadu ne kaha he ki yah nirvivaad he ki lokayukta sanstha jis uddeshy se gathit kii gai thi uski purti janata kii aashaa ke anuroop karne main sakasham nahin rahi he
 According to the provisions of the Lokayukta Act, a provision has been made to make the competent authority take action against the concerned public servant within three months, but proper action is not taken for years on the recommendation of the Lokayukta, as the action is taken by the officers of the same department 
 isliye vibhaag ke adhikari lok sevak ko dandit karne ke bajaay bachaane kaa prayaas karte hai
 The Chief Lokayukta has said that in view of the flaws in the current Lokayukta Acts, the Lokpal Act is being drafted in the new Lokpal Act in view that the Lokpal is being empowered to investigate corruption against Lok Sevak after investigation by Lokpal Once established, it will be necessary for the punishment and the competent authority by the Lokpal to follow the order passed by the Lokayukta
 And follow is not to be created to provide the same kind of penalty on the competent authority
 rajya sarkaar ko bhi lokapal vidheyak ke praaroop main kiye ja rahe praavdhaanon ke anusaar hi lokayukta adhinium kaa bhi praaroop taiyaar kar adhiniyamit kiya janaa chahie
 Before the assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh later this year, the Congress has accused the BJP that it wants to win elections with medicines and injections
 is sambandh main party nechunaav ayogko shikaayat karne kaa bhi man bana liya he
 In fact, the Congress has alleged that "bharatiya Janata Party" is being promoted in the medicines being distributed under the Prime Minister Bharatiya Janaushadhi Project
 congress ke aaropon kii sachai jaanane ke liye 'ajtak' kii team ne bhopal ke ek janaushadhi centre kaa daura kiya to paaya ki vahaan di jane vaali adhiktar dawaaiyon, syrup or injectionon ke cover par bhartiya janaushadhi pariyojna ke pehle akshar bha, ja or pa ko bhagava rang se likhaa gaya he
 From this the short form of the Indian Jan Aushadhi Project "bha
 ja
 Is being created
 isi ko lekar congress ne aarope lagaaya he ki bhaajapa ab chunaav main jane se pehle dawaaiyon or injectionon ke jariye khud kaa prachaar kar rahi he
 Madhya Pradesh Congress spokesperson Shobha Oshre said that the party was serious about the matter and would soon complain to the Election Commission
 unhone kaha, "janhit ke kaam main party kaa naam nahin aa saktaa lekin yahaan ''bhajp'' kaa naam aa rahaa he jo saaf bataa rahaa he ki khud ko mahimamandit karne ke liye bhajp taxperes mani kaa durupyog kar rahi he
 The Congress will definitely complain about this in the Election Commission
 "vahiin bijepi ne ise congress kii hataasha bataaya he
 BJP MP from Bhopal Alok Sanjar said that the Congress is doing politics of colors while they have no right to ask this question
 sanger ne kaha ki congress ne uske kaarykaal main kitni hi yojanaon kaa naam indira gandhi or rajeev gandhi ke naam par rakhaa tab unhe ye kyon yaad nahin aayaa
 Swami Aseemanand, who is being described as the master mind of several bomb blasts in Ajmer and other parts of the country, has reversed from his previous statement
 aseemanand ne yah kahkar sansani faila di he ki jaanch agenciyon ne un par dabaav daalkar unase gunaah kabool karavaaya
 Aseemanand has accused the CBI, NIA and Rajasthan ATS of harassment
 ajmer main cheef jeudicial magistrate kii adaalat main arji dekar aseemanand ne kaha he ki dargah blast main sarkari gavaah banane kii jo chitthee di gai he use wo waapas lenaa chahta he
 The court will hear Aseemanand's application on 8 April
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne beete 14 sitambar ko jab saansad sanjay jaiswal ke bihar pradesh bhaajapa kaa adhyaksh banaae jane ke patr par hastakshar kiye, usase thik 4 din pehle party ke netaa sanjay paswan kaa bayaan aayaa tha ki ''nitish kumaar ko ab siem kii kursi bhaajapa ke liye khaali kar deni chahie
 Some of the opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leaders also expressed the view that Nitish should come back to the Grand Alliance
 yah sanket he ki bihar main agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main maujuuda rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) kaa ek saath laduya or nitish kumaar kaa mukhyamantri pad kaa pratyaashee hona abhi tay nahin he
 Newly appointed president Sanjay Jaiswal has understood this very well, so on the question of face (NDA leader in the state), he says, "the decision on the post of CM will take the central leadership of the organization and the Parliamentary Board
 ''jaiswal us anishchit maahaul main bihar bhaajapa ke adhyaksh bane hai jahaan netritv kaa sawaal munh baae khadaa he
 It is also not easy to maintain harmony within the party and among the allies of JD (U)
 lekin sabase badi chunauti us nerrative ko or bada karnaa he jis par rajya main bhaajapa ke log yah daawa kar rahe hai, ''ab nitish ke chehre par nahin, piem modi ke chehre par vot miltaa he
 "it is clear that in less than a year, Jaiswal has the goal of bringing the BJP to the place where it is not necessary to take Nitish Kumar with him
" 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa kii haar kii badi vajah yah rahi thi ki jad(you) or rajd main gathbandhan tha
 In such a situation, BJP could not make a dent in the backward and Dalit and Mahadalit vote bank, but now it is not so
 bihar bhaajapa ke upaadhyaksh devesh kumaar kehete hai, ''2015 ke chunaav main bhi bhaajapa ko yadavon ke vot mili the
 The central and state government schemes have reached Dalits and Mahadalits during the five-year tenure of the Modi government
 '' devesh agle chunaav ke liye siem chehre par koi pratikriya to nahin de rahe hai, lekin yah kah rahe hai ki bhaajapa lagaataar majboot hui hai
 "when we did not fight with Shiv Sena in the last assembly elections in Maharashtra, BJP emerged as the largest party," says a BJP official
 bihar main 2015 main aisa bhale nahin ho sakaa tha lekin ab samay badal gaya he
 a senior BJP general secretary says, "jaiswal has not been chosen thinking that only the new state president has to be elected
" ve bhi vaisya samudaay se hai jo rajya bhaajapa ke sabase kaddavar netaa or upmukhyamantri susheel modi kii bhi jati he
 "so is the BJP trying to reduce the influence of Sushil Modi in the state? On this a Bihar BJP leader says," Not so, but many people of the party especially the workers believe that Sushil Modi, Nitish Is a supporter of nitish ab 67 saal ke ho gaye hai, isliye apekshaakrit nae logon kii jarurat sanghathan main he jo agle 15 se 20 saal tak party ko majboot kar sake
 "wherever he has been elected president of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan or Bihar, he is between 52 and 55 years old
 yahaan tak ki rashtriya sanghathan mahaamantri bi
 L
 santosh bhi 55 saal ke hi hai
 a BJP leader says that the reason for Jaiswal being elected is not just his caste
 ve yuva hai, peshey se doctor hai, unke dada ke samay se puraa parivaar hindu mahasabha, rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or bhaajapa se judaa hua he
 Jaiswal is not associated with any camp nor does he have any support in the central BJP like Sushil Modi
 ve 8 se adhik rajyon main kisi na kisi jile main chunaav prabharee rah chuke hai or sansad ke satr ke alaava yaa kisi cameti kii meeting ke alaava dilli kii bajaae apane kshetra main rahete hai
 Today's young voters favor leaders who are educated, relatively young and active in the field
 or jaiswal is kasuti par feet baithte hai
 Prime Minister Modi's attachment to Sanjay Jaiswal, close to Modi, is different
 modi jab 2010 main gujarat ke siem the tab jaiswal loksabhaa saansad the
 Modi introduced solar electricity in Gujarat
 lekin gujarat ke solar plant ko tatkaaleen centre sarkaar (manmohan sarkaar) ne sabsidi nahin di
 The Central Government introduced the subsidy scheme in 2012
 jaiswal ne gujarat sarkaar ko solar plant ke liye sabsidi kii maang sansad main uthaai thi, jisase ve modi kii najar main aa gaye the
 *** aam aadmi party ne aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main 350 ummidavaar utaarne kaa elaan kiya he
 Party leader Sanjay Singh has announced this
 aap party ne guuruuvaar ko apni kaaryakarini ke baithak ke baad kaha ki uskaa dhyaan pramukh rup se un 162 siton par ummidavaar utaarne kaa rahegaa jahaan par kathith rup se aapraadhik chhavi vaale netaa hai
 At present, the party is yet to decide how many candidates it will eventually field in 543 Lok Sabha seats
 is party ko bhaajapa ke narendra modi or congress ke rahul gandhi se morcha lenaa he
 The AAP party, which has won the campaign against corruption in Delhi elections, has claimed that the party has increased its membership ever since the party has announced to contest the Lok Sabha elections
 party kaa kahana he ki kareeb ek karod log party ke sadsy ban chuke hai
 All the current surveys do not seem to give the party too many seats, but the victory of the party in Delhi has created panic in both BJP and Congress
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki bhaajapa or congress ab aap party kii hi bhaanti aam aadmi kii baat karne lagi hai
 It is being said that even if the party can win only a few seats, this can not only prevent the party from getting Narendra Modi in power, but also AAP party leader Arvind Kejriwal, who is running a minority government in Delhi, in the Lok Sabha
 i will also get the right to speak
 haal main arvind kejariwal ne kaha tha ki tamaam kendriya mantri bhrashtachar main lipt hai, isliye vah saaf nahin kah sakate ki kitne mantri is baar chunaav main unke nishane par rahenge
 AAP leader Sanjay Singh said, 'corruption and criminalization of politics are two broad issues on which the party will contest the Lok Sabha elections
 party un vibhinn dalon ke aise netaaon ke khilaaf ummidavaar khadey karegi jo bhrashtachar evam raajnneeti ke apradheekaran kaa pratik ban gaye hai
 ' unhone kaha, '162 saansad aise hai jinke khilaaf aapraadhik maamle darj kiye gaye hai

 The move is being seen as an attempt to improve the railway 's immediate service against which there were a lot of complaints for the last few days
 railway adhikariyon kaa maananaa he ki is kadam se na sirf tikat countaron par dabaav kam hoga balki tatkaal tikat lene vaale logon ke liye bheed bhi kam hogi
 Apart from this, the pressure on the website with online ticket facility will also be reduced
 tippaniyan Officials said that soon separate counters will be opened for immediate reservation and CCTV cameras will also be installed to prevent irregularities
 iske saath hi tikat book karne vaale karmchaariyon ko countaron par jane vakt mobile le jane kii bhi anumati nahin hogi
 It is also being said that this change will also help in curbing the brokers

 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne istipha de diya he
 They say that this is the voice of their conscience
 unhone kaha ki unhen kaam nahin karne diya ja rahaa tha or saarvajanik jivan main jab aarope lagen to unka jawaab dena hi padataa he
 His reference was to the Deputy Chief Minister of the state, Tejashwi Yadav, who has come across some irregularities in recent times
 aniyamittaaon ke ye maamle aaj nitish kaa hathiyaar bhi hai or majaburi bhi
 It was because of this compulsion that he had to keep the Grand Alliance on hold and he was forced to resign as Chief Minister, citing the basic principles of his politics
 hathiyaar isliye kyonki nitish isi istife ke dam par kai or chizein jeet bhi rahe hai
 The first direct benefit is that the power has not gone away from Nitish
 satta main bane rahane kii sthiti ko nitish kumaar ne or majboot kar liya he
 His moral judgment has reinforced both his credibility and potential
 nitish ko samarthan dena ab bhaajapa ke liye pehle se or aasaan ho gaya he
 However, BJP had already said that they are ready to support Nitish
 to bhale hi aisa lage ki nitish satta se baahar ho gaye lekin darasal nitish kii jad or pakad majboot hui hai
 He also escaped the charges against Lalu Prasad Yadav and RJD from this one attack and also proved that even if Lalu Prasad has more number, he has the upper hand in politics
 2015 main nitish ko lalu kii zarurat thi lekin aaj nitish ke liye lalu ek boj hai or is istife se nitish kumaar ne wo boj apane kandhon se utarkar lalu ke saamne rakh diya he
 Lalu is now calling for Nitish for grand alliance and secularism, but there is no scope for any change in Nitish's politics and tactics
 nitish ko pataa he ki aage kaa rasta kaise tay karnaa he or sabakuch ek tay patakatha kii tarah aage bad rahaa he
 In the UPA, the crack UPA Nitish Kumar has actually kicked not only the Grand Alliance, but also the UPA
 nitish kumaar baar-baar ye sanket dete rahe ki wo vipaksh ke netaa hai
 There are leaders in whom the decision-making is advisable and in no way obliged to accept the Congress-led opposition opposition
 nitish ne aisa baar-baar sabit kiya
 Then, while the opposition was unanimously protesting against demonetisation
 iske baad raashtrapati chunaav main bhi nitish ne upie ke chehre ko nakaara or bhaajapa ke pratyaashee ko apane samarthan kii ghoshnaa kii
 Actually, Nitish wants to show himself as Congressman, not under Congress
 wo chaahate hai ki unki chhavi abhi bhi upie main vipaksh khojate netaa tak simit na rahe
 Nitish has stood behind the Congress, not behind the Congress after this bet
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke nirdesh par grih mantralay main dedh lakh filein nasht kiye jane se judi khabaron ko sire se khaarij karte hue grahamantri rajnath singh ne aaj kaha ki rashtrapita mahatma gandhi kii hatya se judi 62 filon sahit sabhi dastavej puri tarah se surakshit hai
 Singh said in the Rajya Sabha today that on July 9, a member of the Rajya Sabha had said on the basis of media reports that the Home Ministry had destroyed one and a half lakh files on the instructions of the Prime Minister, including files related to the assassination of the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi
 
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri ne 4 june ko centre sarkaar ke sabhi sachivon ke saath vichaar-vimarsh kiya tha
 In this, he emphasized on improving the work culture and work environment, including maintaining cleanliness and cleanliness at the workplace
 unhone kaha ki iske baad cabinet sachiv kii ore se jo nirdesh jari kiya gaya, usamen yah bhi kaha gaya tha ki 'filon or kagajaton kaa record rakhane ke niyamon ke anusaar unki chantai kii jaani chahie
 
 yah kavayad teen se chaar saptaah main puri ho jaani chahie
 ' rajnath singh ne kaha ki is nirdesh ke anusaar 5 june se 8 july tak grih mantralay ke vibhinn anubhaagon main rakhi gai filon kii samiksha kii gai or kul 11,100 filon ko nasht kiya gaya
 He said that out of the 11,100 files destroyed, not a single one was associated with the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi
 unhone yah bhi saaf kiya ki in filon main koi bhi da
 Rajendra Prasad was not associated with Lal Bahadur Shastri or Lord Mountbatten
 sonaali aacharji ne college board main bharat kii pratinidhi lija jain se baat kii or hair ajukeshan ke liye videsh jane ke icchhuk students ke liye kuch mantra jane
 The College Board is a not-for-profit organization, which was established in 1900
 iskaa uddeshy hair ajukeshan hasil karne ke maukon ko badhanaa tha
 Every year, the college board helps more than 70 lakh students prepare for college admission through some programs
 inamen SAT, PSAT / NMSQT or advanced placement program shaamil hai
 What is PSAT? How does it help students? The Preliminary sat-national Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT / NMSQT) is a comprehensive and standardized assessment that is held in October in schools and helps students prepare for the SAT
 uniwarsity main pahunchane ke raste main PSAT ek mahatvapurn kadam he
 It assesses students' ability in three areas: Critical Reading, Writing and Math
 psatke phaayde1
 The PSAT score report provides a detailed review of students' ability and performance, allowing students to identify their strengths and weaknesses so that they can formulate the right strategy while preparing for the SAT and other similar exams
 2
 Marks are not shown in universities, so it is a pressure-free way for students to test their ability
 3
 It is less than one-fourth of the cost of SAT, it is also good in terms of expenditure
 4
 Students can get online college planning resources and tools for free
 PSAT ke liye kaise register karen:kai hai-skool PSAT oktober ke maheene main yojit karte hai (centre har saal 15 se 18 aktubar ke bich test le sakate hai)
 If you want to take the PSAT, you can get the necessary information by contacting your high school counselor or principal and also know if your school will take this test in 2014
 yues-india ajukational foundation (USIEF) bhi apane kuch kendron main yah test karaata he

 Some suggestions for students: 1
 jald shuruyaat karen:bahut se students, jo videsh main padhanaa chaahate hai, maanate hai ki ve sirf barahavin class main hi isaki yojana bana sakate hai
 They do not know how long it takes and how much effort is required
 students ko dasvin class main hi prayaas shuru kar dena chahie taaki unhen pehle hi samaj aa jaae ki college main jane kii sahi prakriya kya he
 For example, if students have to sit in the SAT, then they should not wait for the 12th
 unhen 10veen se hi isaki shuruyaat kar deni chahie
 Your time in 12th should be saved to focus on other areas of application
 agar duusari baar prayaas kii jarurat pade to 12veen main kiye gaye prayaas ko ek anubhav ke liye istemaal karnaa chahie
 2
 college kii ranking se aage bhi sochen:kai companiyaan univisarties kii ranking prakashit karti hai
 Some are for one country and some are global rankings
 yah jaan lenaa jaruri he ki uniwarsity kii ranking nirdhaarit karne ke liye kuch nishchit maapdand banaae jate hai or ranking unke aadhaar par nikaali jaati he
 Students need to ask themselves the question whether the ranking has given importance to the factors that are important to them
 akasar iskaa jawaab na ho saktaa he
 In such a situation, one should proceed with caution
 ranking main jin soochnaaon ko liya gaya he, ho saktaa he ve aapako apane liye behtareen college khojane main madad na karen
 There is one more thing to remember while looking at the rankings - if a university is given a high rank overall, it does not mean that the subject you want to enroll in is also important
 aapako apni dilchaspee ke subject ke maamle main us uniwarsity kii ranking par gaur karnaa chahie
 NCP President and Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar has given a controversial statement regarding voting

 Addressing the workers of APMC market here, said, 'this time Satara and Mumbai are voting on different days, then all of you first vote in Satara and then come and vote in Mumbai on the 24th
 lekin ye karte vakt haath par lagi syagi pochhna mat bhoolanaa
 Last time voting was done on the same day, there was less voting
 is baar alag alag din voting he
 Pawar also attacked bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi
 unhone kaha, 'desh ke itihaas main pehali baar chunaav ke pehle pradhanmantri kii ghoshnaa maine suni
 Those who do not know the history of the country, what will become the Prime Minister? In Maharashtra, due to drought, a law enforcement organization from Gujarat was prosecuted in Gujarat
 aise rajya kaa siem desh kaa pradhanmantri kaise ban saktaa he
 There was an uproar over Pawar's statement on voting, so NCP tried to save the party president
 party pravaktaa nawab malik ne kaha ki sharad pavaar majaak main yah baat kar rahe the
 Malik said, 'if you watch the video of the meeting, then he is smiling saying his words
 haalanki, vipakshi dal pavaar ko bakhshane ke mood main nahin dikh rahe hai
 BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said, 'from what Sharad Pawar has said, it is clear that how the ncp-congress is winning in Maharashtra now
 unka ye raaj sharad pavaar ne khud bataaya diya
 It is showing that the law and order does not matter to Sharad Pawar
 inkaa ye etticude ho gaya he ki maharashtra ke grih mantri aar aar patil to apane hi aadmi hai to ham kuch bhi bolen
 The Election Commission should take action against Pawar
