 punjab congress pramukh amarinder singh ne desh main daliton par hinsa kii ghatnaon kii ninda kii or mudde par pradhanmantri narendra modi kii 'khamoshi' par sawaal kiya
 In a statement issued here, the former Punjab Chief Minister said, 'there are incidents of verbal and physical abuse and violence on Dalits everywhere and it seems to take dangerous form
 ashanka he ise desh main jatigat ladaai bhadakaane ke liye protsaahit kiya ja rahaa he yaa ise najrandaaj kiya ja rahaa
 Comments maamle par pradhanmantri kii 'khamoshi' par sawaal uthaate hue unhone hairaani jataayi ki unhone ab tak hastkshep kyon nahin kiya he
 He asked PM Modi, 'how can you turn a blind eye when this kind of cruelty and barbarity is happening on the people of the country

 pradhanmantri narendra modi nedillimein swatchta abhiyaan diwas ko deshvyapee banaate hue bada program kiya
 This program of Modi was shown by putting big screens in many places across the country
 dilli bijepi adhyakshamanoj tiwarine bijepi ke rashtriya sanghathan mantri raamalaal ke saath apni loksabhaa ke khajuri chowk par piem modi ke swatchta abhiyaan ko manaaya
 But apart from stage speeches, this program proved to be a mere joke
 program to tha ki badi si screen par piem modi ke bhaashan ko saansad mahoday ke saath sab dekhenge
 In this program, Modi heard the statements of Amitabh Bachchan, mother Amritanandamayi, UP CM Yogi
 lekin yahaan manoj tiwari ke program main na amitabh dikhe na modi dikhe na yogi dikhe
 MCD workers were filled with anger, showing only black big screens and black flags outside
 manoj tiwari sanghathan mahaamantri raamalaal ke saath fliover ke neeche jhaadu lagane nikal gaye
 But here too, his efforts were only seen as a show
 media or camaron ke saamne jhaadu chalaai gai lekin sirf dikhaave ke liye
 The garbage of the right was left and the garbage of the left was corrected and the garbage was left there
 emsidi karmiyon ne kii sadak jamdarasal, program subah saadhe 9 baje shuru hua or 2 ghante ke is program main ek bhi baar screen thik nahin ho saki
 Rather 20 steps away from the program, angry activists of MCD would be seen shouting slogans with black flags
 apni maange naa maanane se naaraaz emsidi karmiyon ne sadak tak jam kar di
 When the BJP MP was questioned in this regard, he appeared to be avoiding the issue
 or poocha ki emsidi karmchaaree unase naaraaz kyon hai isaki unhen vajah bataani chahie
 Organization General Secretary Ramlal said in the middle that this is a matter inside us, we will deal with it
 emsidike shahdara ke chayaraman pramod gupta apane saansad kaa bachaav karte hue bole ki saansad ko or bhi kaam hai
 So he left quickly without cleaning
 unhone kaha ki saansad ko kisi ne bhi samasya nahin bataai
 MCD workers are performing without talk

 An Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) official said, "the sky will remain partly cloudy throughout the day and there is a possibility of rain in the evening

 desh bhar main aawaara kutton kii taadaad teen karod se zyada he
 Every year, these dogs also bite people in lakhs
 magar aisa pehali baar ho rahaa he ki ek ilaake main achaanak kutton ke aadamkhor ho jane kii baaten kahi ja rahi hai
 Not only this, it is also being said that these man-eating dogs have killed 13 children so far
 maamla uttar pradesh ke sitapur kii he
 The danger is that now the administration has stopped the children from going out of the house
 khauf itnaa ki khud mukhyamantri ko us ilaake kaa daura karnaa padaa
 Did man-eating dogs take the lives of children? There are three crore stray dogs in India
 kutton ke kaatane se har saal desh main 20 hazaar logon kii maut hoti he
 Rabies causes death
 jiske sabase zyada maamle bharat main paae jate hai
 If you look at the figures, it is 35 percent of the whole world
 par ab sawaal yahi he ki kya ab kute aadamkhor ho rahe hai? kya sitapur main bacchon ko maarane vaale aadamkhor kute hai? kya 13 bacchon koadambor kuttone maaraa?shikari kute, prashasan naakarabacchon ghar ke andar hi rahanaa
 Don't get out baahar shikari kute hai or prashasan naakaara hai
 It is not enough that after 6 months, they can find out whether there are man-eating dogs or anyone else who killed 13 children in Sitapur
 ji haa, may ke maheene main khayrabad ilaake main kutton ne apana 7waan shikaar bana liya he or is tarah november se lekar ab tak 13 masuumon kii jaan ja chuki he
 Had curfew for children been inflicted, there would have been very less number of unhappy people in the world
 mukhyamantri ji
 
 
 You should make sure that no mother's lap is lost
 ab koi maasoom jaanwaron kaa niwala naa bane, kyonki lakhanu se lekar mathura tak ke tamaam kaabil afasar or sitapur prashasan milakar bhi in mauton ke aankadon ko roak nahin paa rahaa he or ulta prashasan ne khayrabad main bacchon ke liye karfu laga diya he
 Sitapur trembling with the terror of dogs, the 13th dogs were hunted
 sirf may maah main kutton ne 7 maasoom bachche maar daale
 After this, 10-year-old innocent dogs were maltreated
 is tarah se ab tak kul 13 jindagiyon kaa kaal ban chuke hai ye kute
 Because of this, there is an atmosphere of 'curfew' for the innocent in Sitapur
 gharon main kaid bachepulisavaale ke alaava block development officer, gram pradhan, lekhpal, doctors, teachers, cotedaaron or naa jane kin kin logon kii samitiyaan banaai gai hai ki aadamkhor kutton kaa kahar khatm ho
 But the police encounter, the sight of the drone camera and the effect of binoculars are all proving to be useless
 kute apni harkaton se baaj nahin aa rahe
 Now the police administration is finding it difficult to control the dogs, so they are writing the children's studies and advising them to stop playing and stay in the house
 maasoom kii maut se phuta gussaye isliye kyonki itani mustaidi ke baad bhi khayrabad ilaake main kutton ne 10 saal kii maasoom rina ko apana shikaar bana liya
 Innocent Reena had gone to the fields outside the village with her family to pick up wheat earrings
 is dauraan kutton ke jhund ne maasoom par hamalaa bol diya or nonch-nochakar use maar daalaa
 The anger of the angry people erupted with the death of innocent Reena and the whole village came out on the road with sticks and sticks with the dead body
 logon kii bheed ne neshnal haive 24 ko jam kar diya
 Police administration failed police-administration tried a lot to convince these people
 magar ye log bhi kab tak samajhenge
 Because even after the deaths of 13 innocent people, so far the administration has not been able to locate a single hunting dog
 pataa lagaana to dur ye tak nahin pataa chal paaya he ki bacchon par hamalaa karne vaale kute hi hai yaa koi or junglee jaanavar
 On the contrary, the police are trying to control people by lathi-punishing them
 ye alam tab he jab khud mukhyamantri yogi adityanath is ilaake kaa daura kar chuke hai
 Within just 48 hours of this tour, Chief Minister yogikay dogs hunted innocent Reena
 ilzaam he ki november se lekar ab tak kareeb 6 maheenon main kute yahaan 12 maasoom bacchon ko apana shikaar bana chuke hai
 Out of which 6 children lost their lives in the first week of May only
 november main himanshi or sonam kutton kaa shikaar bane
 In January the dogs made Mubin their prey
 farvari main maasoom shagun kutton ke hamalon main maaraa gaya
 In March, Arbaaz and Sania were attacked with a fatal attack
 or may main ab tak shaavani, khalid, komal, gita, virendra or kasim ko kutton ne apana shikaar banaaya
 These incidents are very strange
 gali ke kutton kaa achaanak aadamkhor ho janaa hairaan karne vaala he
 That's why so many things are happening
 adhikariyon ke bayanon main virodhabhasasitapur ke espi kaa kahana he ki kutton ko gosht khaane ko nahin mil rahaa he isliye wo insaanon ko kaat rahe hai
 But the question is that slaughterhouses are closed all over UP
 to gusse main sirf sitapur ke hi kute kyon? or mana ki in kutton main khaanaa naa mil paane kaa gussa he
 Then why do they run away just by attacking the necks of children? Animal welfare officer Saurabh Gupta says that if those dogs have become man-eaters, then why have those dogs only bitten, not eaten? Wild man-eating predator dogs! It is not that street dogs cannot be man-eaters
 lekin aisa tabhi hota he jab wo dimagi santulan kho baithen
 But it is not possible that the flock of the herd go crazy together
 to sawaal ye he ki kahin aisa to nahin jinhen gaanv vaale kutta samaj rahe hai wo koi or he? kyonki hamalavar kute hi hai is bare main koi sahi-sahi nahin kah rahaa
 An eyewitness says she was like a dog but strange
 kuch gaanv waalon kaa kahana he ki jo kute bacchon par hamalaa kar rahe hai
 They are not outdoor street dogs, but outdoor hunting dogs hiding in fields and orchards
 jinaki bhaagane kii raftaar bhi zyaada he or ve bahut khoonkhaar hai
 Goats and cows were also made in all the villages within 10 km radius of Khairabad in Shisitapur, there has been terror
 gaanv waalon ke mutabik sirf bacchon ko hi nahin balki gaay or bakriyon ko bhi shikaar banaaya ja rahaa he
 Hundreds of goats and dozens of cows have been attacked deadly by these dogs
 ek adhikari kaa kahana he ki hamalavar kute nahin bhediye ho sakate hai
 Are the attack dogs or someone else? The fear is that the children have stopped going to school
 kisaanon ne kheton main janaa band kar diya he
 And those who are going are sitting on top of the loft
 par sawaal ye he ki kya hamalavar sachmuch main kute hi hai? yaa phir koi or? is aatank kii tah tak pahunchnaa zaruri he

 'rocky Handsome' is a remake of the Korean film The Man from Nowhere

 So it was a little review of the film's story and now i will talk about the shortcomings and merits of the film
 tippaniyan Among the flaws, the writer and director have failed to make a Hindi adaptation of the film
 film ke kirdaaron ko copy karne ke chakkar main kirdaar vishwasaneey nahin ban pate or kuch kirdaar bahut hi laud or nakli lagate hai
 For example, Taddy Maurya plays Luke, Manto as the character of the film and Nishikant Kamat himself
 ye kirdaar na to kuch nae lagate hai or na hi aap par koi asar chhodte hai sivaay shor ke

 This too was not introduced with any newness
 sabase badi baat yah ki is film main sol yaa kahen aatma nahin he
 It keeps moving upwards and cannot reach your heart
 mujhe yah film ek tay dharre par chalati nazar ai
 Like the song Aana Ab Ab Fight scene and Ab Chasing, this film neither gives you a shocking twist nor takes you on any emotional journey
 film ke gane, sangeet yaa cinemetography kuch bhi mujhe prabhaavshaalee nahin laga

 is a study has revealed that the consumption of pasta is helpful in reducing blood sugar levels as well as reducing hormones that cause hunger
 pasta kaa seven jab saamaanya hai
 Cabrehydrate is made with food such as bread etc
 These cabrehydrates ensure better absorption in the body, as a result of which the level of blood sugar decreases much more than expected
 yah khulaasa toronto vishvavidhyalay ke poshan vibhaag dwaara kiye gayi ek adhyayan se hua he
 Dr
 Cyril Kandal, a professor in the Department of Nutrition at the University of Toronto and head of this study, says that reducing the amount of glucose in the blood is important in the prevention and control of diabetes
 vastav main pasta ke seven se madhumeh se jude jokhimon main kami aati he
 Dr
 Kandal states that our preliminary results make it clear that foods with high levels of cabrehydrate help to prevent and control diabetes due to the glycemic characteristics of pasta reducing the effects of blood sugar
 madhumeh visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki bharat duniya main madhumeh kii rajdhani ke rup main janaa jaataa he jahaan kareeb chaar karod log madhumeh se grast hai or varsh 2025 tak yah ankada 8 crores tak pahunchane kii sambhaavna he
 Dr
 RR Kasliwal of Medanta The Medicity, Gurgaon, Haryana, says in this regard that mono found in pasta
 saturated fat sharir main kharaab kalesterol ke str main kami laane ke saath saath achche cholesterol ke str main badhottaree karata he jo hriday ke bachaav main sahaayak he
 Kasliwal also says that consuming pasta c
 reective protein ke str main kami laata he jo hriday rogon kaa jokhim ko badhaata he
 Another colleague of this study, Dr
 David Jenkins and Dr
 Kendall, said that this study reveals that the consumption of pasta with a diet rich in cabrehydrated causes a significant reduction in blood sugar levels
 jaise-jaise pasta kaa seven badhata he blad sugar main bhi teji se kami aati he
 If only pasta is consumed, the increase in blood glucose is minimal

 yuvak ke sharir main goli kaa bhi ek ghaav mila, or bahut lambi duuri tak ghasite jane kii vajah se uskaa ek paanv gaayab mila
 Police said that at the moment it could not be told for sure whether the young man Mukul Kumar was shot and killed before being dragged
 SP (gramin) avinaash pandey ne bataaya, "shav ke chehre or sir par bahut-si choton ke nishaan hai
 
 
 The left leg is missing, and the other is also severely impaired
 
 
 hamen hapur ke mandi ilaake tak lagbhag 15 kilometre kii duuri tak khun ke nishaan mili hai, jahaan mukul apane parivaar ke saath rahaa karata tha
 
 
 According to "SP", this clearly indicates that the body was dragged to such a long distance, and then thrown into the Kharkhoda area of meerut
 
 
 uske kareeb hi ek motorcycle bhi baraamad hui he
 
 
 "the mutilated body was seen by passers-by near an under-construction underpass close to Dhirkheda village on Tuesday
 mukul ke parivaar ke mutabik, mukul kaaphi sharmila yuvak tha, or uski kisi ke saath dushmani nahin thi
 His uncle Azadvir said, "mukul had completed his studies only last year
 
 
 vah apni maa tathaa bade bhai ke saath hapur main rahata tha
 
 
 He was a quiet young man and he never had any quarrel with anyone
 
 
 uske parivaar kii bhi kisi ke saath koi dushmani nahin he
 
 
 "though an FIR has been lodged, the police have no idea of the motive for this murder, which is currently done in a brutal manner
 SP ne kaha, "aparaadhiyon kaa iraadaa lut kaa rahaa hota, to ve motorcycle chhodkar nahin jate
 
 
 It could be a quarrel between his friends
 
 
 "ghatnasthal se baraamad hui motorcycle meerut ke rohta gaanv nivasee sachin kii he

 "police adheekshak ke anusaar, "ham kol detail record nikalava rahe hai, jisase baaten spasht ho sakati hai

 The West Indies were expected to perform better in the shorter format, but have not been able to challenge, as their batsmen continue to struggle
 west indies kaa bhagya nahin badal sakaa, kyonki bharat ne kochi main 88 gend rahete chah wicket se jeet darj kar shrunkhlaa main 1-0 se badhat bana lee
 The win was a relief to the wounds of the Indian bowlers, who had lost a lot in the last ODI series against Australia and managed to put some pressure on the batsmen

 Since then, Kohli has scored two consecutive centuries against Australia and the West Indies here, making it his favorite place too

 In ideal terms, the government would have liked to see these figures reversed — growth rates above 7 percent and inflation below 6 percent
 lekin 2012 main aisa nahin ho paaya or yah maanane kii bhi (jaisaa ki sarkaar main kai log maanate hai) koi vajah nahin dikhti ki 2013 main aisa ho paaegaa

 There are 07
 haalanki, antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel ke daam saal 2013 ke mukaable kaafii kam hue hai
 It is not understood that when the price of crude oil has come down, why are the prices of petrol and diesel being increased in the Indian market instead of decreasing? Modi government, which came to power by demanding votes from the people, has betrayed the people of the country
 jab se modi sarkaar satta main ai he, chaahe wo petrol-deazal ho, gharelu gas ho yaa phir khaane pine ke zarurat kii chizein ho, mahangaai ne saare record tod die hai

 modi ne piem se is mudde par sabhi mukhyamantriyon kii baithak bulaane kii apil kii thi
 Taking an attack on Manmohan Singh on Tuesday, Narendra Modi said, "if this bill comes into force, families living below the poverty line will get 10 kg less grain
 yani ve bazaar se maheene kaa rashan kharidne ke liye majaboor ho jaaenge jiskaa asar unke salanaa bajet padegaa to yah bill garibon ke haq me kaise hua?'narendra modi ne kaha, 'is bill kii khaamiyon ko lekar maine piem ko chitthee likhi thi
 But it seems that the government's attitude on this issue is lax
 sarkaar ke mantri bade-bade daawey kar rahe hai, par hakeekat kuch or hi he
 Earlier BPL families used to get 35 kg of food grains
 par is bill ke anusaar 5 logon ke parivaar ko masik taur par sirf 25 kilo anaaj milegaa
 'narendra Modi said,' The central government should call a meeting of all chief ministers on this issue
 kyonki is bill ke anusaar garibon main anaaj baantne kii jimmedaari rajya sarkaron kii hogi
 In such a situation, where will the grain come from, who will pay for it

 Already, many states have such schemes in force

 CBI court judge SG Dighe dismissed the plea saying, "cbi's plea is dismissed
" ’ nyaayadhish ne kaha ki rajyapal ke
 Despite Sankaranarayanan rejecting the cbi's plea for approval of the indictment against Chavan, he (chavan) can be tried under the anti-corruption Act as he faces charges of criminal misconduct
 nyaayadhish is sambandh main vistrut aadesh jari karenge
 In his arguments, Special Public Prosecutor Bharat Badami said that the CBI would be "very happy" to prosecute the former chief minister, but "we have our hands tied

 The CBI said that since he was a former Chief Minister at the time of being included in the charge sheet, permission from the Governor was not necessary
 rajyapal ke
 After Sankaranarayanan refused, the court ordered the agency to seek permission to prosecute Chavan
 iske baad sibiai ke paas chavaan ke khilaaf maamla band karne ke alaava zyada koi vikalp nahin tha
 The CBI had alleged in its chargesheet that Chavan had increased the floor space index in lieu of acquiring flats for his relatives in the disputed Adarsh society
 rajasav mantri ke rup main chavaan ne houseing socity se 40 pratishat nagarikon ko bhi shaamil karne ke liye kaha tha
 While this society was originally meant for war soldiers
 sibiai ne daawa kiya tha ki is ghotaale main chavaan ne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi
 The society has flats by Chavan's mother-in-law Bhagwati Sharma, sister-in-law Seema Sharma and father-in-law's brother Madanlal Sharma
 nyaayik panel ne in sabhi ko socity main flat hasil karne se ayogy tehraaya tha
 In its charge sheet filed in July 2012, the CBI had accused Chavan and 12 others of criminal conspiracy, cheating and criminal misconduct under the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act

 AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi lashed out at Union Minister Prakash Javadekar on Monday for his statement that 'there is no alternative to the Prime Minister'

 bjp's stage was decorated in Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha
 mauka rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak kaa tha
 When the turn came to speak at this two-day meeting held on 15 and 16 April 2017, President Amit Shah shocked everyone
 unhone party netaaon se do took kah diya ki aap log kisi bhulaave main mat rahiye, abhi bijepi kaa svarnim kaal nahin aayaa he
 Amit Shah's statement was also shocking because before the executive, many of the winners of the big win had joined bjp's 'rajmukut'
 2014 main chaahe bahumat se centre kii satta main pahunchnaa ho yaa phir haryana, maharashtra jaise rajyon main sarkaar bananaa
 At the same time, a month before this executive meeting held in Bhubaneswar, the party hoisted the victory flag in the country's largest state Uttar Pradesh
 amit shah ne us baithak main party netaaon ko aage or mehnat karne kaa sandesh dete hue kaha tha- '2014 main jab ham jite to logon ne kaha bijepi charmotkarsh par pahunch chuki he
 The same was said in 2017, but the party is yet to climax
 hamaari kalpana he ki har pradesh main hamaari sarkaar ho
 There should be 'bhajparaja' from the panchayat to the parliament
 us vakt amit shah ne bijepi ke svarnim kaal ko desh ke svarnim kaal se bhi joda tha
 Shah does not find himself at the summit in 2019, even after Shah won the 2019 Lok Sabha elections with a thumping majority, Amit Shah does not find the party at the top
 bhartiya janata party ke dilli mukhyalay par guuruuvaar(13 june) ko party padaadhikariyon kii meeting main amit shah ne 2017 main bhubaneshwar kaaryakarini vaali baat phir doharaai
 He said that BJP has not yet reached the pinnacle of success
 yah bayaan aise vakt par aayaa, jabaki modi-shah ke netritv main bijepi lagaataar do sthir sarkaar banane ke maamle main indira gandhi kii aguwai vaali congress ke record kii barabari kar chuki he
 At the same time, the process of majority government has started in the country after three decades
 saath hi 303 siton ke saath bijepi ab tak ke sarvshereshth pradarshan par he
 Shah wants to break the record of 1984? Why is Amit Shah not satisfied even after the BJP government formed with a bumper majority in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections? BJP sources say that the answer to this question is hidden in the slogan of BJP 'abki Baar Baar Hundred Paar'
 bijepi sutron kaa kahana he ki bijepi ne 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main chaar sau siten jeetne kaa target tay kiya tha
 Many leaders used to give this slogan in rallies
 bhale hi bijepi ne prachand jeet hasil kii, magar chaar sau se zyada siten jeetne kaa target puraa nahin hua
 This incomplete wish is now ready to be completed in 2024
 party ke ek varisht padaadhikari ajtak dot in se baatcheet main kehete hai- jahaan tak mujhe khabar he ki amit shah 1984 main congress kii 414 siten jeetne kaa record todna chaahate hai
 This has been the biggest victory in the history of the country's parliamentary elections
 1984 main indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad congress ne rajeev gandhi ke netritv main chunaav ladaa tha
 The Congress had set the record for the biggest victory by riding on the sympathy wave that followed the assassination of Indira Gandhi
 us chunaav main bijepi ko do siten milin thim
 What else does Shahakhir want and how much success does Shah want? In response to this question, a national level BJP official points to Amit Shah's speech at the Odisha executive
 jisamen amit shah kehete hai ki party kaa charmotkarsh tabhi hoga, jab har pradesh main sarkaar hogi
 It is well-known that BJP and NDA currently have government in 17 states of the country
 purvottar ke rajyon kii satta main bhi bijepi pahunch chuki he
 Even the Left's stronghold Tripura has been captured by the BJP
 magar dakshin kaa durg ab bhi bijepi se dur he
 Party sources reveal that Amit Shah is determined to form the BJP government in key states like West Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala
 aise main in rajyon kii satta par bhi bijepi kaa kabja hone ke baad sambhav he ki amit shah kaa bayaan aae ki ab bijepi safalataa ke shikhar par he
 BJP can break the recordbjp sources believe that due to the hard work and strategy of Amit Shah, BJP can break the record of winning 414 seats of Congress in 1984
 party netaa bhi yah maanate hai ki 2019 main bijepi apane dam par 303 siton tak pahunch chuki he, vahiin endie 353 siten jeet chukaa he
 All opposition parties, including Congress, are battered
 vipaksh main majboot chehron or ekta donon kaa abhaav he
 In such a situation it is not impossible to win more than four hundred seats
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki party chaahati he ki grih mantri hone ke saath-saath amit shah abhi bijepi adhyaksh rahen
 So that the party can record further victories

 is bich 2004-05 se 2017-18 ke bich 5 karod gramin mahilaon ne job market chhod diya
 According to the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) 2017-18 Periodic Labor Force Survey (PLFS), this decrease is most commonly seen among women aged 15–59 years
 in aankadon ke mutabik pichley 2004-05 or 2017-18 ke bich kaamkaaji gramin mahilaon kaa naukari ke prati rujhaan aadha rah gaya he
 According to the English newspaper The Indian Express, the NSS report, which has been banned by the central government, shows the phenomenal trend in the women's national job market is shocking

 It was 6 percent
 is lihaaj se kaamkaaji gramin mahilaon kii bhagidaari 2004-05 kii tulana main ghatakar aadhi rah gai
 According to experts, one of the reasons for such a big decline in the participation of rural women may be their increasing participation in education, but merely the growing trend towards education does not explain the situation
 iske alaava jo kaaran bataae ja rahe hai wo yah he ki, kam mahilaayein hi pehle se sikudte rojgaar bazaar jisamen purushon kaa bolbalaa he, main tikna nahin chaahati hai
 Apart from this, the cultural change in the society can also be a reason
 haalanki is report main khaas baat yah he ki shahari ilaakon main kaamkaaji mahilaon kii bhagidaari 0
 There has been an increase of 4 percent
 is lihaaj se pichley 6 saal main naukari kii chaah rakhane vaali mahilaon kii sankhya 12 lakh badi he

 input: bhashaa Naqvi Vs Asaduddin Owaisinagarism Law in Agenda Aaj Tak: Discrimination against Minorities after CAA: Owaisinckvi said- Hindus are secular because of Agenda Aaj Tak's session 'religion of Citizenship' in Union Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and AIMIM President Asaduddin There was a heated debate between Owaisi
 donon netaaon ne naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon or enarasi ke mudde par purajor tareeke se apana paksh rakhaa
 On the one hand, Naqvi spoke about the government's intention behind implementing this law
 vahiin, duusari ore ovaisi ne iskaa virodh karte hue inaki khaamiyon kii sarkaar kaa dhyaan khinchaa
 Owaisi said that we have no problem in granting citizenship to the minority Hindus of the three countries, the government can call and grant citizenship to all Hindus in Pakistan
 lekin majahabi aadhaar par jo kanoon lagu hua he vah samvidhan ke khilaaf he
 Does Narendra Modi and Amit Shah know more than Nehru, Ambedkar, Sardar Patel and Rajendra Prasad who implemented the country's constitution
 jo kaam in logon ne nahin kiya wo ye karne ja rahe hai
 There will be discrimination against minorities
 Owaisi said that this law will discriminate against the minorities of Hindustan because it is necessary to see CAA and NRC together
 kisi hindu or muslim ko naam NRC main nahin aayaa to hindu to batch jayega lekin muslim nahin batch paaegaa
 The government should have implemented NRC earlier
 sarkaar desh ke 120 karod logon ko line main khadaa karne vaali he or phir sabko videsh banaakar unase dastavej maange jaaenge
 Naqvi, while replying to NRC, said that it is not possible that no one has any of the required documents
 phir bhi jo log enarasi se baahar ho gaye hai unhen apil karne kaa mauka diya jayega, tribunel main jane kaa adhikaar diya jayega
 He said that CAA is not for the citizens of the country but for the minorities of the three countries, this law has been brought, you cannot try to combine the NRC and the Citizenship Amendment Act
 samvidhan kii vajah se secular bharatanakavi ne kaha ki bantwaare ke baad bharat main hindu bahusankhyak the or pakistan main muslim, lekin desh ke hinduon ne bharat ko hindu mulk nahin balki dharmanirpeksh desh banaaya jabaki pakistan bahusankhyak musalamaanon kii vajah se islamic desh bana
 He said that the Hindus of Hindustan have secularism and tolerance in their hearts only then this country is the most powerful in the world
 ovaisi ne kaha ki hindu chaahate hai isliye yah desh dharmanirpeksh nahin he balki isliye secular he kyonki hamane apane samvidhan ko aisa banaaya he
 He told Naqvi that you are doing harm to India by joining Pakistan, this constitution is secular and hence India became a secular country
 owesi ne kaha ki samvidhan ke tahat koi faisla aata he to vahi samvidhan hi to hamen use chunauti dene kii ijaajat bhi detaa he or hamane ayodhya cese main vahi kiya he

 Although in Ramadan it is usually Muslims who serve Rosa and Iftari, but there are some Hindus who provide Iftari for others
 kiran sharma bhi ek aisi hi mahila kaa naam he
 Significantly, people come to Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah to pray
 mattha techne aate hai lekin is bich kuch aise bhi log hai jo apane kharche par jaruratmandon ko rojaa-iftaar kara rahi hai

 Something happened that Kiran Sharma and her daughter had fallen victim to an accident
 unki beti ke bachane kii ummid bahut kam thi

 In such a situation, she comes here every year in the month of Ramajan and makes people iftaar
 desh bhar main allaah ke bande rojaanaa rojaa rakhte he or allaah ke darbar main aakar namaaj adaa kar apana rojaa iftaar karte hai
 There is something more beautiful here in the Pak month of Ramadan
 dargah ke chif in charge afasar nijaami kaa kahana he ki rojaanaa yahaan kai log aate hai
 These people include Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians
 yahaan kiran sharma bhi apni ore se ek khubasurat koshish karti najar aati hai

 ve aise main dua karne kii baat kehete hai jisase desh bhar main ekta or saamanjasy bana rahe
 Samajwadi Party President Mulayam Singh Yadav is known for his political claims
 buudhvaar ko jab unhone 325 pratyaashiyon kii jo list jari kii usamen kai tarah ke raajnneetik sandesh or ranneetiyon kii saaf jhalak milti he
 Actually, Mulayam seems to be trying to create many types of balance through this list
 saath hi, wo anya sambhavit sahyogiyon ko bhi sidhaa sanket de rahe hai ki gathbandhan hoga to unki sharton par hi hoga
 Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and party's state president Shivpal Yadav are face to face with the Samajwadi Party over the last few months
 chachaa-bhattije kii is ladaai main party pichley kuch samay se lagaataar charchaa main he
 However, Akhilesh has emerged stronger after this fight and his position in the party as well as the government has strengthened
 shivpal party main kamazor to pade hi hai, saath hi logon ke bich bhi unki saakh kamazor padi he
 But Netaji is well aware that weakening of any one wheel is not going to make a point
 na hi netaji chunaav se thik pehle baghawat ko sir uthaane dena chaahate hai
 Hence, there is an attempt to balance between Mulayam's List Party and power as well as uncle and nephew
 ghar main santulanmulaayam singh yadav kii ore se suchi jari kiye jane se pahalokhilesh or shivpalpani-apni pasand kii suchi jari kar chuke hai
 But both have their mark in the list of Netaji
 haalanki shivpal akhilesh par baari pade hai or mulaayam ne unhen niraash nahin kiya he
 The time to be disappointed is Akhilesh
 lekin iske peeche netaji kaa raajnneetik daanv bhi he
 If Akhilesh needs to move towards victory, he needs to be with the party and family
 shivpal sadaa se mulaayam ke senapati rahe hai or sanghathan par unki majboot pakad he
 Netaji knows that for Akhilesh to win, it is very important for Shivpal to fully mobilize and be with him
 saath hi wo yah bhi samajhate hai ki agar tikaton main bhi shivpal kii puri tarah se andekhi hoti he to wo kahin ke nahin rah jaaenge or is sthiti main baagi ho sakate hai
 Rebellion between the party and the family can prove to be a tough challenge for Mulayam at this time
 shivpal ke naamon ko shaamil karke mulaayam ne unhen krutharth kar diya he or ab shivpal ke paas netaji or akhilesh ke liye ji-jaan se jutane ke alaava or koi vikalp nahin hoga
 a senior party leader explains this situation, "akhilesh is the most powerful contender for the post of Chief Minister in the party
 shivpal unka jawaab nahin ban sakate
 Therefore, today, people who seem to be on Shivpal's list, will work to bring Akhilesh to the throne tomorrow
 shivpal kaa khush hona akhilesh ke liye katai nuksaandeh nahin he
 "it remains to be seen how Akhilesh is able to give both signs of patience and victory to his supporters and the rest of the state with this decision, because Akhilesh's strong weakness or Netaji's dominance over him is ultimately good for sp's electoral mathematics
 Will not done
 gathbandhan kaa sarvesarvadusraa daanv netaji ne khelaa he sahyog ke liye aatur partiyon ke saath
 At a time when the Congress and other political parties are looking forward to the Samajwadi Party for an alliance, Netaji is repeatedly reiterating that he will single-handedly contest and win
 ab325 pratyaashiyon kii ghoshnaa ke saath netaji ne sahyogi dalon koghutanon par laa diya he
 No announcement has been made by Netaji for 78 seats, indicating that there is still scope for an alliance
 lekin saath hi unhone yah bhi sanket de diya he ki agar kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ko samaajawaadee party ke saath gathbandhan karnaa he to wo keval or keval unki sharton par hoga
 By announcing his nominees for the five seats of Amethi and Rae Bareli, Netaji has also told Congress, the largest constituent of a possible alliance, that he is not going to work under their terms or pressure at any cost
 yah bhi ishaara kar diya gaya he ki jise gathbandhan karnaa ho, 78 kii simit sankhya main rahete hue kare
 Netaji kept the 325 figure in his possession so that if there is a wave in support of the party in the election, then the majority or close to his number can be removed from his own party
 baaki dalon par apni nirbharta ko wo kam se kam rakhana chaahate hai
 Playing strange games with Netaji Kongress
 wo congress kaa saath lekar mayawati ke dalit-muslim ganit ko bigaadna to chaahate hai lekin isaki evaj main congress ko uskaa hissaa dene ke liye taiyaar bhi nahin hai
 Though the stakes in Mulayam's courtyard change anytime
 aaj kaa sach chunaav ke daravaaje tak hoobahoo rahegaa, aisa katai nahin kaha ja saktaa he

 Asked about the involvement of Governor Devanand Kunwar and opposition RJD leaders Abdul Bari Siddiqui and Ghulam Gaus in the Chief Minister's feast, Nitish said that the governor is an integral part of the government and the state
 unhone kaha ki chaahe satta paksh ho yaa vipaksh aaj ke din koi raajnneeti nahin hoti, kal ve satta main the or aaj ham satta main hai

 unhone kaha ki jab vah raibareli or amethi pahunchin tab vahaan par bhi cameti kii samasya thi
 i trimmed excess people in every committee
 pradesh main bhi yahi formula lagu kiya jayega
 But now the Lok Sabha elections are on the head and time is short
 2019 ke baad hi sanghathan main pherbadal hoga
 Till then, the workers will have to try hard
 no selfih pehali baar tha jab congress kaaryakarta is tarah se priyanka se mil rahe the
 Everyone was desperate to take a selfie, but the SPG explained to them that it was not allowed to take a selfie
 suraksha ke maddenjar selfi lene se manaa kiya gaya he
 At the end of every meeting, Priyanka took a group photo with the workers which would be formally sent by the party
 lakhanu se chunaav ladaane kii uthi mangapriyanka ne kaha, 'main sanghathan ko majboot karne kaa kaam karuungi
 He said this to both the teams formed for the Lucknow parliamentary constituency
 darasal kaaryakartaaon ne unako lakhanu se chunaav ladane kii apil kii thi

 jis par priyanka ne kaha ki baahar jo naare laga rahe hai un jaise jamini kaaryakartaaon ko party main tavajjo dene kii meri koshish rahegi

 jamini netaaon ko mauka milegaa
 He instructed the activists to stop factionalism in the party and fight unitedly in 2019
 priyanka ne yah bhi kaha ki 2022 main upi main apni sarkaar banaaenge

 However, some books are such that the reader, apart from the review, connects with himself so much that he not only reads it, but also adjusts to many
 isi kadi main aaj pesh he ek kitaab- 'madaripur jankshan'
 Balendu Dwivedi's work 'madaripur Junction' not only stands the test of the review, but also helps the readers to understand the village and the landscape of India beyond India
 darasal, kisi parighatna yaa phir desh-kaal ke paridrishy ko sahaj or saral tareeke se sabake saamne rakh paanaa na to aasaan hota he or na hi is vidha main adhiktar log shrilaal shukla, harishankar parasaai or premchand sareekhe paarangat hote hai, jo vyang or aanchalikta ko saath lekar puri abhivyakti ko ek shabdon ke saath pero de
 If you have read the book Raga Darbari of Srilal Shukla, then you will find it only its new version
 baharhaal, vyang karnaa itnaa aasaan kabhi nahin rahaa
 Because no one knows when the satire is tinged in the color of squirt and vulgarity
 magar madaripur jankshan main balendu dvivedi ne apni vyang kii style ko sahitya kii seemaa main rakhte hue jis tarah se kitaab ke taane-bane ko buna he, vah is baat par yakeen karne se roak detaa he ki balendu kii yah pehali rachana he
 Frankly, Madaripur Junction is an excellent example of language, fluency, style and regionalism
 itnaa hi nahin, madaripur jankshan vyang, romaanch or romance kaa jabardast sangam he
 Now, if we talk about Madaripur Junction, it is a depiction of a completely rural environment, which the author has specifically pointed to the Hindi speaking region of North India
 yani ki madaripur jankshan ek kalpanashiltaa kaa ek behtareen udhaaharan he jise padhate vakt pathak apane gaanv se rilate kar saktaa he
 If the reader is familiar with the village and its surroundings, then to tell the truth, this novel will go straight into his mind in a simple manner and he will clearly see the picture of his village
 darasal, shuru main yah upanyaas madaripur gaanv ke parivesh or uske paatro ko samajhane kii behtareen koshish he
 In this, the author has also used words and abuses which are used in our society in common language to depict the village and the real Indian environment
 lekin gaur karne vaali baat he ki lekhak ne un shabdon ko yahaan jabardastee feet nahin kiya he, balki sthaan, paatr or parivesh kii maang par lekhak ne un gaaliyon or aanchalik shabdon kaa istemaal kiya he
 The novel is a glorious tale of a mutual dominated struggle between Bairagi Babu and Chedi Babu, the two contenders for the post of Madaripur
 yani ki madaripur jankshan mukhya rup se inhen do paatro ke ird-gird ghumti jarur he, magar kirdaar aise-aise hai jo kahin bhi upanyaas ke lay ko todane nahin dete
 Chedi Babu and Bairagi Babu are childhood friends, uncles and nephews in distant relationships and then later enemies
 upanyaas main romance ko shuruyaat main hi kaaphi behtareen tarise se chitrit kiya gaya he
 Actually, there is a bear Baba in Madaripur, who is a Baba to say, but the elder is a Rasiya
 rasiyaa prasang main bhaaluu baba shivalay ke puujaari hote hai
 These babas are less balderies and the chiefs of balderies are more
 wo aise rasik mizaaj ke hote hai ki paas ke talab main snaan karti mahilaon ko nity dekhnaa unki dincharya kaa zaruri hissaa hota he
 But one day, due to this, they get beaten up that no one even knows where the bear Baba went from the village
 ek or anya prasang main lekhak ne us daur ke parivesh ko chitrit karne kii koshish kii he, jab nasbandi ko lekar kai tarah kii samaaj main afvaahen uda karti thim
 Nowadays the way the culture of rumor is developing in the era of social media, its hallmark can be clearly seen in Madaripur Junction
 darasal, ek din media vaale gaanv main aate hai, phir gaanv main aisi hawa uthati he ki nasbandi karne aae hai or sarkaar jabaran sabakaa nasambadi kar rahi he
 It has so many interesting and relevant episodes one after the other that the reader is not in a position to take the book away from him for a moment and holds it to the end
 upanyaas main baar-baar aapako chavanni or athnni pattee se saamana karnaa pad saktaa he, isliye kanfooj mat hoiyegaa
 While Chedi Babu dominates in Chavanni belt, Bairagi Babu dominates in Athanni belt
 darasal, upanyaas main ye donon pattee hi gaanv kii dhuri hai
 The election rhetoric of Pradhani post in the village is the central development of the novel and its two main characters are Chedi Babu and Bairagi Babu
 sach kahuun to madaripur jankshan pathak ko ant-ant tak baandhe rakhti he
 There is not a single incident in which the reader feels that the writer has forcibly inserted
 madaripur jankshan bhartiya gramin samaaj kii mul avadharana ko darshaati he, jo shaayad ab bhi gaanvon main thodi-bahut basati he
 Therefore, the reader will surely realize this while reading this

 There is not a single incident in which the reader feels that the writer has forcibly inserted
 madaripur jankshan bhartiya gramin samaaj kii mul avadharana ko darshaati he, jo shaayad ab bhi gaanvon main thodi-bahut basati he
 Therefore, the reader will surely realize this while reading this
 ab agar madaripur jankshan kii baat karen to yah puri tarah se gramin parivesh kaa chithran he, jise lekhak ne vishesh taur par uttar bharat ke hindi bhashi kshetra kii ore ishaara kiya he
 That is, Madaripur Junction is a great example of imaginativeness which the reader can relativise from his village while reading
 agar pathak gaanv or uske parivesh se parichit he to sach kahuun to yah upanyaas sidhe taur par sahaj tareeke se uske man main samaa jayega or use apane gaanv kii tasviir saaf-saaf dikhaai degi
 Actually, this novel is an excellent attempt to explain the surroundings of Madaripur village and its characters
 isamen gaanv or asli bhartiya parivesh ko usee rup main chitrit karne ke liye lekhak ne un shabdon or gaaliyon kaa bhi prayog kiya he, jise hamaare samaaj main aam-bol chaal main prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 But it is worth noting that the writer has not forced those words here, but on the demand of place, characters and surroundings, the writer has used those abuses and zonal words
 upanyaas madaripur ke pradhan pad ke do daavedaar bairangi babu or chhedi babu ke bich aapasi varchasv vaale sangharsh kii ek shandaar katha he
 That is, Madaripur Junction is mainly revolving around these two characters, but the characters are such that they do not let the rhythm of the novel break anywhere
 chhedi babu or bairangi babu bachapan ke dost hote hai, dur ke rishte main chachaa-bhatija hote hai or phir baad main dushman to hote hai
 Romance in the novel is depicted in a very good way from the beginning
 darasal, madaripur main ek bhaaluu baba hote hai, jo kehane ko to baba hai, magar hai to bade vaale rasiyaa
 In the Rasiya context, bears are worshipers of Baba Pagoda
 ye baba kam ganjeri or gangerion ke sardaar zyada hote hai
 They are of such a mood that it is an important part of their daily routine to see women bathing in a nearby pond

 In the novel, you may have to face it again and again with Chavanni and Athanni Patti, so do not get confused

 Actually, both these strips are the axes of the village in the novel

 Madaripur Junction reflects the basic concept of Indian rural society, which probably still resides in villages a little
 isliye pathak ko yah padhate vakt iskaa ehsaas jarur hoga
 Actually, this novel is an excellent attempt to explain the surroundings of Madaripur village and its characters
 isamen gaanv or asli bhartiya parivesh ko usee rup main chitrit karne ke liye lekhak ne un shabdon or gaaliyon kaa bhi prayog kiya he, jise hamaare samaaj main aam-bol chaal main prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 But it is worth noting that the writer has not forced those words here, but on the demand of place, characters and surroundings, the writer has used those abuses and zonal words
 upanyaas madaripur ke pradhan pad ke do daavedaar bairangi babu or chhedi babu ke bich aapasi varchasv vaale sangharsh kii ek shandaar katha he
 That is, Madaripur Junction is mainly revolving around these two characters, but the characters are such that they do not let the rhythm of the novel break anywhere
 chhedi babu or bairangi babu bachapan ke dost hote hai, dur ke rishte main chachaa-bhatija hote hai or phir baad main dushman to hote hai
 Romance in the novel is depicted in a very good way from the beginning
 darasal, madaripur main ek bhaaluu baba hote hai, jo kehane ko to baba hai, magar hai to bade vaale rasiyaa
 In the Rasiya context, bears are worshipers of Baba Pagoda
 ye baba kam ganjeri or gangerion ke sardaar zyada hote hai
 They are of such a mood that it is an important part of their daily routine to see women bathing in a nearby pond

 Much has changed in these five years
 jo sabase zyaada badla wo sawaal poochne kii vyavastha
 Knowing the foundation of this arrangement was inadvertently cast by Salim Javed in the movie 'walled' in 1975
 jab amitabh apane daaroga bhai shashi kapur ko kehete hai ki jaao pehle us aadmi kaa sin lekar aao
 In my opinion, this line has now changed to the line that go first come and ask why it has not happened in 70 years
 yah samvaad is baat par khatm hota he ki uske baad mere bhai tum jis kaagaj par kahoge sin kar duungaa
 But Daroga Bhai clearly said that by proving the crime of others, this truth cannot be changed that you are also a criminal
 yah sachai tumhaare or mere bich ek diwaar he bhai
 The good thing is that nobody has said why the smartphone did not arrive 70 years ago
 ani ve
 Every phase has some identity
 isamen ek or nagina joda he hamaare pradhanmantri modi ne
 Read the first translation of this excerpt from his speech in Gujarati
 
 
 hamaare desh main ab yah samskruti ban gai he ki sarkaar ko hi sara kaam karnaa chahie
 If you are not doing any work, then you should question the government
 hamaare desh main aisi samskruti nahin thi
 Never was
 log dharmashala banaate the, gau shaala banaate the, or pani kaa parab banaate the
 Used to make wells ye saare kaam sarkaar ne kabhi nahin kiya
 These were created by social people
 dharmashala, pani kaa parab, librari sab logon ne banaae
 Gradually, unknowingly, the power of the people was suppressed and the power of the state governments increased
 main yah kah rahaa hum ki rajya sarkaar loktantr kii zimmedaariyon ko puraa kare or samudaay samaaj ke kalyaan ke liye kaam karte rahen
 This develops society
 saamudayik prayaason ke sandarbh main pradhanmantri kii baat sahi he lekin yah baat general tareeke se kah dena ki aapse koi kaam nahin ho rahaa he to aap sarkaar se sawaal karen
 The government's job is not to make Dharamshala and no community should work for Dharamshala
 lekin haj house bhi banaae gaye or dharmashalaayein bhi
 The governments also planned to conduct pilgrimages and all remained silent
 magar yah kahana ki aapse koi kaam nahin ho rahaa he to aap sarkaar se sawaal karen, thodi samasya paidaa karata he
 And when was the culture of questioning not in our country
 pradhanmantri ne kai udaahranon main librari kaa zikr kar diya to beshak librari samaaj ne bhi banaae hai magar sarkaron ne kyon chhod diya
 It is also the government's job to build a library
 dilli main lakhon kii sankhya main har rajya se chaatr aae magar koi bataae ki centre or rajya sarkaron ne kitni librari banaai
 Go to the areas of Delhi where students live in rented houses
 privet librari khul gai he
 Students do not have a place to read
 1000 rupee kiraaya dekar librari main padhane kii jagah pate hai
 When going to Mukherjee Nagar, the common complaint of students is that there is no place to study
 bahut paise lagate hai
 Such a library has opened all over Delhi
 dilli hi nahin jaipur or patna tak main librari ek kaarobaar ke taur par punap chukaa he magar rajya or kend sarkaron kii yojanaon se public librari kaa naam gaayab he
 Many students who are not from college need a library
 pichley dinon aapako yaad hoga ki dilli ke nazangarh se ek ladke ne likhaa he ki nazangarh main librari nahin hoti he
 Students there have to travel a distance of 35 to 45 km
 unhone bijepi ke saansad or aap ke vidhayak se sampark kiya magar kisi ne librari nahin bani
 Could not find the place
 dilli jaise shahar main librari banane kaa kaam sarkaar kaa hi he
 This question should also be asked by the government, but students do not know the basic thing so that they can make it an issue
 is shahar main saikadon kii sankhya main librari ban gai he magar do do sarkaron kii rajdhani main sarkaron ne kitni librari banaai ye sawaal poochne kii nai samskruti pehle nahin thi, isliye ab paidaa kerani hogi
 Abhishek of Najafgarh told that he traveled 16 km from one side to the library
 donon taraf milakar 32 kimi kii yatra librari ke liye karata he
 The question of employment is arising
 pradhanmantri modi ne ek intervyuu main pakora talane ko rojgaar kaha tha
 Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb had said that unemployed youths should leave government jobs and open pan shops and start raising cows
 khub aalochana hui
 Now Kamal Nath government is formed in Madhya Pradesh
 congress sarkaar ke paas rojgaar ko lekar kya nayaa idia he
 There has been a news report in local newspapers that the Chief Minister Kamal Nath's government is going to give the youth to play band banda under the Yuva Swabhimaan Yojana
 chhindwara me band bajaane kii training ke liye ek skool kholaa jayega
 There are so many good band masters in our country without any school
 jo sarkaar ke skool kalege se padhakar nikal rahe hai unhen to inhen sarkaron ke salaahkaar bataate hai ki ve kisi laayak nahin hai
 Is there any plan to spoil good band masters by putting them in these schools? hamen pataa nahin band master kaise ban jate hai magar har shaadi main aaj mere yaad kii shaadi kaa dhun bajataa he ye pataa he
 Why do they need school
 kya vaaki hamaari raajnneeti ke paas rojgaar ko lekar koi thos jawaab nahin he
 What kind of employment is a question, but no government is taking concrete initiative on how to get the government examination of employment
 upi se lekar assam tak ke chaatr ab pareshaan ho gaye hai
 Students of Assam have emailed that the Panchayati Department of the state government has removed 945 vacancies on 20 May 2018
 5 march 2019 ko rigelt nikal gaya
 Meanwhile, the CID investigation took place, the investigation revealed rigging
 chaatro ne or vipaksh ke netaa tarun gogoi ne aarope lagaaya ki bijepi or sangh se jude logon kaa chayan kiya gaya he
 Now the Chief Minister has formed an inquiry committee of one person
 magar ahmedabad main ek kamaal hua
 The examination took place on 3 March, Shivratri was discharged on 4 March and the result arrived on 5 March
 dedh saal kii naukari series ke dauraan ye chamatkaar maine nahin dekha tha
 This is the news of the message newspaper
 technical suparviser or inspector ke is imtahaan main 17,900 chaatr baithe the
 The results should be discussed everywhere after the examination in two days
 ahmedabad municipal karporation ne imtahaan lene or rigelt nikaalane main niyamon kii parvaah nahin kii
 On Sunday, the AMC took the exam papers and kept the question papers, the candidates did not even answer the questions
 kisi ko khabar tak nahin hui do din main rigelt aa gaya
 It is also in this news that the students have alleged that the call letter for the appointment was given before the examination
 arakshit shreniyon ke hisaab se rigelt nahin nikaala
 a call was made to examine the documents before the result was removed
 in samasyaon kii nazar se dekhenge to desh main koi lahar nazar nahin aegi
 Guest teachers movement is going on in Delhi
 usamen do dhaaraon kaa sangharsh he
 One section says that no one should get a job without exams, one section says that those who have been teaching for many years should get it
 shikshakon kii do dhara ke saamne bijepi or aam aadmi party kii bhi dharaaen hai wo alag hai
 Like Abhishek Yadav from Delhi, Mohammad Nazim from Sonbhadra in UP has shot a video
 kahani triveni express kii he
 We have also checked the data of this train ourselves
 agar hamase chook nahin hui he ki 365 dinon main yah train 32 baar hi samay par pahunchi he
 Has been canceled 11 times and is lying 322 times
 ausat saadhe paanch ghante let chalati he
 Thanks to Nazim who made the visuals of this train available to us
 14369 tanakpur se sonbhadra hote hue singrauli jane vaali yah train shaayad hi kabhi apane samay par chalati he
 Tanakpur is ahead of Bareilly
 vahaan se lakhanu tak thik aati he magar uske aage jo dhire hoti he, dhire hi hoti jaati he
 Travelers claim that from 2016 to March 2019 it has never reached its time
 chori kii ghanaa aam he
 Station master does not provide complaint book for lodging complaint
 express kaa rate dekar paisanger se bhi badtar haalat he
 Travelers have tweeted a lot to the Railway Minister about the Triveni Express
 jinamein rail mantri ko chunauti di gai he ki ve triveni express ko samay par chalaakar dikhaa den
 Otherwise stop the Triveni Express itself, it wastes a lot of time
 singrauli se lakhanu aane main yah train hameshaa 5 ghante kii deree se pahunchati he
 There is no cost to public life
 sabase badi baat he ki angrezi main bhi twit karne par rail mantri ne triveni express kaa kuch nahin kiya he
 If we put these questions in front of the performance of the governments, if there is any government, then the governments will feel that they have unnecessarily burnt thousands of crores of advertisements
 public ne triveni express kaa sawaal uthaakar mazaa kharaab kar diya
 We often think that all these are not news, but big news is something else
 chunaav ayog kii press conference
 Sure, but on the same day, at the same time, these people are searching for news channels, their lives are at stake
 kaash kisi kaa dhyaan pad jaataa
 These days, teachers who pass the secondary education eligibility test from Bihar send a lot of messages
 is certificate se shikshakon ko sarkari naukari mil jaani chahie thi magar kai logon ko nahin mili
 7 years have passed and now on 31 March their certificate will expire
 ab tak inamen se bahut log hindu muslim dibet main rame the, inhen dusron ke sawaal kaa mahatv samaj nahin aa rahaa tha
 Now these journalists are searching for themselves when their lives are at stake
 inamen se kai sawaal karne vaale patrakaron ko gaali bhi dete honge magar inhen swatantra or janata kii baat karne vaale media kaa mahatv samaj aa rahaa he
 All of these problems are fatal
 31 march ko inhen state teacher eligibility test STET kii paatrata samaapt ho jaaegi
 The certificate will expire
 7 saal se shikshak banane kaa certificate lekar baithe rahe magar naukari nahin mili
 Vacancy did not come
 inkaa kahana he ki bihar main 5700 skool bina shikshak ke chal rahe hai or shikshak banane kii inaki paatrata kii miyaad samaapt ho rahi he
 We are sad to delete these messages sent in hundreds of numbers
 kahaan bade bade ankar chunaav kaa vishleshan kar rahe hai or main tet or nagar palika kii naukari ko lekar program kar rahaa hum
 But the pain in these messages, the pain that is there is not of any one
 puure system ke udasin or nirmam ho jane kii katha he isamen
 Who did these people not go to? vidhayak se mantri tak
 They want their certificates to be extended to expire so that they can lose themselves in waiting for a few more years
 jab tak messej bhejne vaale log apane sawaal ko lekar sirius nahin honge, is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin milegaa
 Sending me messages from Ara, Patna, Gopalganj and Bhagalpur to see India Pakistan match does not solve it
 in sab messej se guzarate hue lagata he ki nagarikon ne hi apana naagarik bodh samaapt kar diya he
 What a terrible loneliness
 khud ye kabhi prime time main madhyamik shikshak kii paatrata STET se sambandhit khabar nahin dekhenge magar mujhase chaahate hai ki main dikhaaun
 Elections have been announced
 ab mujhe aise messej na bhejein
 no point
 adhikari or mantri ab chunaav ke kaam main lag gaye hai
 Your problem was not important to them earlier and now they have got a valid excuse
 berojgaare ke sawaal par chunaav nahin hoga
 Had it been, all the leaders would have been talking about it till now
 channelon main dibet ho rahaa hota
 i know you are under stress
 kisi kaa certificate laps ho jaae or naukari na mili tanaav samaj saktaa hum
 But you want to give a talisman to the unemployed
 jab bhi niraashaa ho ki naukari nahin mili, apane ghar main koi news channel lagaaein
 In front of him, he stood for six seconds in careful mood
 ankar ke dikhte hi teen baar bharat mata kii jai bolen
 You will forget your pain
 or aisa karne se sena kaa manobal bhi nahin giregaa
 By the way, why are your leaders not talking about employment? kya aap nahin chaahate
 Today, it has been reported in the Indian Express that the wages of work related to agriculture have fallen considerably
 jinaki kheti he unki aamadani 14 saal main sabase kam hui he
 Still, there is no farmer in the media
 raajnneeti ko tamaasha mat banaaiye
 It's election time, be serious during this
 di vir par dhiraj mishra kii yah report ganga ke kalyaan main bahut kaam aegi
 The Wire has asked RTI how the National Ganga Council was formed in October 2016, how much it has been sitting so far
 neshnal ganga council ke adhyaksh pradhanmantri hai
 According to the rule, it should meet once a year
 magar artiai se soochna mili he ki neshnal ganga council kii ek bhi baithak nahin hui he
 Whereas it has been two years since its creation
 iskaa kaam tha ganga nadi ke pani kaa prabandhan, sangrakshan karnaa
 It is the apex body to review the ongoing projects related to Ganga, but not a single meeting could be held in two years
 ganga hamaari samskruti ke alaava 2014 ke baad kii raajnneeti kaa mahatvapurn ang he or isaki chotii kii sanstha kii ek bhi baithak nahin hoti he
 We are really serious
 aam aadmi kii jeb ko ek or jhatka laga he
 Petrol prices have increased once again
 haalanki yah vruddhi maamuli hi he
 Petrol prices went up by 35 paise per liter on Tuesday
 badi keemten aadhi raat se lagu hongi
 Increased crude oil prices are being attributed to the rise in both
 is badhotaree ke baad dilli main petrol kii keemat 67
 56 per liter
 alag-alag shaharon main petrol kii keemten vahaan ke bikri or waite kii vajah se alag alag hongi
 It is worth noting that in the months of October and November last year, petrol prices were cut by 56 paise and 95 paise respectively
 pakistan kii ek aatankwaad nirodhak adaalat ne purv pradhanmantri benazir bhutto ko suraksha muhaiyaa karaane main kathith taur par kotahi baratane ko lekar do sheersh police adhikariyon ko pakhwaade bhar kii nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya
 Meanwhile, former Rawalpindi police chief Saud Aziz's lawyer has claimed that he had made enough arrangements for Benazir's election meeting the day he died in a suicide attack
 giraftaar kiye gayi police adhikariyon main ajij bhi shaamil hai
 Aziz's lawyer Wahid Anjum told a press conference in Rawalpindi that Pakistan People's Party leader Rehman Malik was warned by Aziz that Benazir was threatened when he exited his bulletproof vehicle
 gauratlab he ki malik benazir ke suraksha salaahkaar the
 Benazir was killed in a shootout and bomb attack when she boarded her armored vehicle after an election rally on 27 December 2007
 baharhaal, kai visheshgyon or pipipi ke netaaon ne daleel di he ki benazir ne yadi is vaahan se apane sharir ko baahar nahin nikaala hota to vah is hamale main batch sakati thi
 Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram is not even taking the name of improving Manjhi's bad words
 maanjhi ne ek baar phir vivaadit bayaan diya he
 Manjhi said, 'if a person sleeps after drinking a full cup of wine, i don't mind him
 'maanjhi haal hi main bihar ke danapur ke mahadalit sammelan main pahunche the
 In the conference, Manjhi said that if people go to sleep after drinking alcohol after work in the evening, then i do not mind it
 haalanki maanjhi ne baad main safai dete hue kaha ki meri umr 70 saal he lekin maine kabhi daaru ko haath nahin lagaaya
 He told the people of Mahadalit community to drink the medicine in the form of Daru
 nashe ke kaaran mahadalit log na to apane bacchon kaa dhyaan rakh pate hai, na hi jivan ko behatar kar pate hai
 If you want to drink, drink some alcohol as a medicine
 gauratlab he ki maanjhi ne kuch din pehle kalabazari ko lekar vivaadit bayaan diya tha
 Manjhi had said that if you do black marketing, for your stomach
 apane bacchon kii padhai ke liye
 i do not think your children will study abroad
 bahut bhi karte honge to aap apane bachche ko patna yaa phir kisi or chote shahar main padhaate honge
 If you do black marketing for that, i thank you
 agar choti-moti galtiyaan hongi to bihar ke mukhyamantri hone ke naate ham aapako maaf kar denge
 ' desh kii sabase surakshit maani jane vaali tihaad jail ko lekar ek mashhoor kahawat he
 The saying is that no one can kill even Parinda without permission
 lekin ab hakeekat yah he ki is jail main har wo gunaah mumkin he, jiske bare main aap soch sakate hai
 Between these crimes, there have been reports of death and murder from this prison
 yah katl ek hai security jail ke hai risk ward main hua he
 a sudden scream came out of the ward on Tuesday night in ward number 5 of jail number eight and caught everyone's attention
 lekin jab tak anhoni se ghabaraae santari ward ke kareeb pahunche, tab tak maamla haath se baahar nikal chukaa tha
 a Kaikideepak Singh locked inside the ward was lying on the floor
 uske jism main harakat takreeban band ho chuki thi
 While four other prisoners who were with him in the same ward stood red-handed on the spot
 ward main akele pad gaye deepak par jaanaleva hamalaa hua tha0 or yah hamalaa kitna khaufnak tha, iskaa andaja sirf isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki uske chaar sathikidiyone mil kar naa sirf uski ankhen phod di thim, balki kuch nukili chizon se uske chehre se lekar takreeban puraa jism hi chalni kar diya tha
 Now the jail administration hurriedly picked up the lamp and sent it to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, but by then it was late
 doctoron ne deepak ko mrit ghoshit kar diya
 Deepak was lodged in the same jail for the last seven years in 14 cases of crimes like robbery, robbery and kidnapping
 uski gitni jail ke khoonkhaar kaidiyon main hoti thi, use ward number 5 main rakhaa gaya tha
 The background of those whose hands are stained with blood in the accusation of the murder of Deepak is no less dangerous
 ye kaidi satpal bedi, manpreet, suraj or riyaj hai
 If sources are to be believed, Satpal, who is jailed in the charge of such a crime with a double murder, is not only the kingpin of the remaining gangsters in this ward, but he also runs the business of recovery from jail
 apni dabang shakhsiyat kii vajah se hi satpal jail main baaki kaidiyon ke kaam kii javabdehi bhi tay karata he
 That is, who would do Saikadikya and who would rest, he used to decide all this in his ward
 ab deepak ne satpal or uske gang ke saath rahete hue bhi uski shakhsiyat ko chunauti dene kii shuruyaat kar di thi
 If sources are to be believed, this was largely the reason behind the murder of Deepak
 agar tihaad prashasan chaukas hota aurakidiyon par nigaharkhi jaati to yah vaardaat nahin hoti
 Here, the prisoners who were enemies of each other were not only kept together, but the same prisoners for months kept plucking things like plates, spoons and pipes and sleeping with oil in the orange ears

 The eyes were in the sky and the eyes were on the plane
 nabbe ke dashak kii sharuaat thi
 Gopal Goyal Kanda owned a small radio repair shop in Sirsa, a small town in Haryana

 There were hardly a few hundred or thousand rupees of income from this shop in a month
 par kanda kii nazren ab tak aasmaan main hawaii jahaaz par gad chuki thim
 But from a modest radio repair shop, he could not even clear the sky

 Kanda started measuring political soles with Bansi Lal's son
 bansilaal ke bete ke kareeb aayaa to achaanak rusuukh badhanaa shuru ho gaya
 But then as soon as Bansi Lal's government went, Kanda started measuring the feet of Om Prakash Chautala's sons without delay
 sir par siyaasi haath aayaa to juute ke vazan bhi badhate gaye
 But even now, it had to be done by swinging between the business creditor and the government
 lihaaza kanda ne phir pintara badla
 He now wanted to make politics a business, while his brother Govind was in politics
 kehete hai ki isi dauraan ek ai e es afasar sirsa main aae or unheen afasar kii jholii bhar-bhar kar kanda ne vyapaar kaa apana dayera or badhanaa shuru kar diya
 Then, the officer was transferred to Gurgaon

 With this decision, the land of Gurgaon became gold and the silver of the land

 Kanda's fate door was now going to open completely
 lihaaza sirsa se usne apana scooter uthaaya or sidhe gudgaanv pahunch gaya
 Now brokerage had become his profession
 zamin sona ugal rahi thi or wo sona nigal rahaa tha
 Time passed slowly and then in 2007, a sudden news shocked the entire Sirsa
 gopal kanda ne apane vakil pita muralidhar lakharam ke naam par emdlaar naam kii airlines company shuru kar di
 But the accounts of MDLR airlines were so bad in the accounts of right and wrong that Kanda's aerial dreams were evaporated

 After coming to the ground, Kanda tried her hand at hotels, casinos, property dealing, schools, colleges and even local news channels

 Independent mlas made their own bids and in the same bid, Gopal Kanda recovered his price and became the Home Minister of Haryana
 ab kanda ko police salaam thokati thi
 Kanda's henchmen, once henchmen of politicians and their sons, were also lions

 Although the henchmen were inside, there was no heat on the minister

 Money and power brought a lot of dirt
 kanda ne apni zyaadaatar companiyon main ladakiyon ko bhartee karnaa shuru kar diya
 At a young age, girls were given big posts and one of them was Delhi's Geetika
 2006 main haawai company main airhostess or cabin kru kii bhartee ke liye gudgaanv main intervyuu tha
 In the same interview, Kanda met Geetika for the first time and at the end of the interview gave her a letter from the Trainee cabin crew
 phir chah maheene baad jaise hi geetika 18 saal kii hui use airhostess bana diya
 After this, there was a race between Geetika's progress and time
 vakt se bhi tej geetika tarakkee kii seedhiyaan chadhati gayi or faqat teen saal ke andar company main train se company kii diarector kii kursi tak pahunch gai
 All this was kind to Kanda
 meharbaaniyaan barasati raheen or geetika tarakkee karti gai
 But then suddenly something happened that Geetika walked away from both Kanda and her company
 usne dubai main naukari kar lee
 But Kanda forced him to return to Delhi
 dilli aane ke baad bhi kanda ne geetika kaa peechha nahin choda or isi vajah se uskaa dam kuch is kadar ghutane laga ki usne apana galaa hi ghont liya
 But before she died, Geetika wrote the truth in two pages that forced Kanda to measure the ground for the first time
 hawaii jahaaz se to wo pehle hi utar chukaa tha
 But Geetika's suicide note gave her a chance to try her shoes
 12 din tak police se bhaagane ke baad aakhirkaar kanda ke pair or juute donon thak gaye
 And maybe with this, his speed also stops
 jis shaks ko pakadaney ke liye dilli police ne 12 dinon se apane saare ghode khol rakhe the, jisaki giraftaar ko lekar bade-bade daawey kiye ja rahe the, us kanda ko police us vakt bhi nahin pakad pai jab wo elania khud apane pairon par chal kar thane kii dahleez tak pahunch chukaa tha
 The truth is that Kanda did everything exactly as he thought, from running away to surrender
 ham kanda ko bahut jald giraftaar kar lenge, hamaare best bwoys is kaam par lage hai
 The message commissioner tweeted at around 10:30 pm on August 17, when the news came that Kanda could surrender anytime tonight
 har kisi ko ye pataa tha ki kanda raat ke andhere main agar sarender karegaa to kahaan karegaa? zaahir he raat ko court nahin khulata or cese north-west district police ke paas tha jinke disipi kaa daftar ashok vihaar thane main he
 So at the break of news, all the crime reporters reached Ashok Vihar police station as soon as they could
 reports or news channel ke obi kii har pal badhati taadaad ko dekhte hue majabuuran thane ke baahar ab police waalon kii bhi taadaad badhane lagi
 Reporters of top police officers started calling on whether Kanda was really coming to surrender
 reporters ke apni khabar par date rahane ke baad raat gyaarah baje ke baad pehali baar police ko laga ki nahin khabar main dam he
 So the police officers, who were asleep or going to sleep, were grabbed and posted outside the Ashok Vihar police station with a huge police gathering so that at least Kanda would be there to catch the police
 vakt bitne ke saath ab halaat bhi tezi se badal rahe the
 The scene outside the police station was presenting a picture of maida-e-jung
 bas atapata ye tha ki police dushman kii taraf badhane kii bajaae apni jagah khadi uske aane kaa intjaar kar rahi thi, kamishnar sahab ke twit ke ulat
 After this, the new spectacle begins at 12:10 pm
 kanda ke aane se pehle uske samarthak ashok vihaar thane ke baahar aa dhamakate hai
 They raise slogans of Kanda's name and hang out there to welcome her
 is puure tamaashe kii aguai karata he usee kanda kaa bhai
 Standing outside the police station in front of all the policemen, Kanda's brother proclaims to reach and surrender to Kanda as if a big leader or a prominent person is usually announced in an election rally
 haalanki ab tak police ko shaayad sab samaj main aa chukaa tha
 That is why all the borders of the north-west District were sealed
 ashok vihaar kii taraf aanevaali har sadak par paharaa bitha diya gaya
 Barricades were put in place, i thought that if not, then it is like that
 kamishnar sahab kaa twit sach sabit hoga or kanda ko sarender se pehle hi unke best bwys use pakad lenge
 But Kanda is really amazing
 jab tak man kiya chupa rahaa or jab chhupate-chhupate bor ho gaya to apni marji se elaan kar police ko chunauti dete hue ashok vihaar thane kii dahleez tak pahunch gaya
 But still the police could not catch him
 subah kareeb sava chaar baje police ko chakma dene ke liye kanda apane news channel kii gaadi main baith kar thane tak aayaa or jis tarah chahta tha usee tarah sarender kiya
 The best boys of Commissioner could not catch him till the end
 vaise yahaan ek sawaal or bhi he
 Did Kanda deliberately leak news of the surrender to the media? So that on hearing the news, the media reach the place mentioned and they take advantage of the same crowd to reach there in the car of their news channel
 If this is the case then this is also a lesson for Delhi Police
 kyonki dilli police use pakadaney kii tarkeeb to nahin dhund pai haa, kanda ne police tak pahunchane kaa rastaa zarur dhund liya
 It is said that those who knew Kanda always warned him of only one danger, and that was the danger of his closeness with girls
 kanda hameshaa apni companiyon main ladakiyon ko sabase aage rakhata
 Some of the pictures received by the media are of a Satsang where Gopal Kanda is dancing on the stage, while Geetika is involved with him in the Satsang
 in tasveeron se geetika or gopal kii nazadikiyon kaa saaf pataa chalata he
 Actually, call it Gopal Kanda's weakness or hobby, but the truth is that Gopal was more interested in girls
 aruna chaddha, noopur mehta, ankitha or geetika sharma, ye wo chand naam hai jinhe gopal kanda ne apni company main oonche ohadon par baithaaya
 He gave big salary and packages at a young age
 skool uniwarsity or karodon kaa bijness empire chalaane vaala kanda ladakiyon par kuch zyada hi meharbaan tha
 Gopal Kanda had formed 48 companies, not one or two
 in companiyon main badi taadaad main ladakiyon ko oonche ohadon par kaam diya gaya, jinamein company diarector, dipti diarector or company secretary jaisi post shaamil hai
 Among these thirty eight companies of Gopal Kanda, Gopal Kanda himself is the director
 kanda kii company i ke ji infrobild main geetika sharma ko up-nideshak kii post di gai thi jabaki aruna chaddha company kii diarector thi
 Surprisingly, Geetika joined AKG Infrabuild on 3 March 2012, a few months before her death
 kanda ne in companiyon ke alaava kai trust bhi bana rakhe hai masalan em di el aar international skool sirsa
 In this school too, Geetika Sharma was registered as a trustee
 kanda kii company main aruna chaddha or geetika ek duusare se kitni nafrat karti thi uskaa zikr to geetika ke suicide note main hai
 Both Aruna and Kanda are now under police custody and the police will try to unravel every truth of Kanda's empire of crores along with knowing the reason for Geetika's suicide

 On Monday, the leaders of both parties also separately met the Governor
 isse mana ja rahaa he ki mukhyamantri or sarkaar main padon ko lekar baatcheet sulajh nahin saki he
 BJP spokesperson Shweta Shalini said, "there may be many things in the 50-50 formula that Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray is saying during the Lok Sabha elections
 chunaav ke dauraan 50-50 pratishat siton par ladane kii baat bhi to ho sakati he
 It cannot be used to sit in the Chief Minister's chair for two-and-a-half years

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered a speech on Thursday from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 73rd Independence Day
 british hukumat se 15 agast 1947 ko bharat ko swatantraaa hasil hui thi
 Pakistan celebrates its Independence Day a day before i
e
 on 14 August
 pradhanmantri modi ne laal kile se swatantraaa diwas par bhaashan diya to pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne buudhvaar ko mujaffarabad main paak adhikrut kashmir (pok) kii asembli main apana bhaashan diya
 Most of Imran Khan's speech was targeted at India and PM Modi
 apane bhaashan main imran ne kashmir kaa bhi bahut baar ullekh kiya
 At the same time, PM Modi did not mention the name of Pakistan or Imran Khan even once in his 92 minute speech
 piem modi ne afghanistan ko badhai di jo 19 agast ko apana 100waan swatantraaa diwas manaane ja rahaa he
 The Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) of India Today conducted a comparative analysis of the words spoken in the speech of the two Prime Ministers
 imran khan ne bhaashan main kya-kya bolaa?pakistan ke piem imran khan ke swatantraaa diwas bhaashan main 'kashmir' hi chaaya rahaa
 At the same time, Imran's nervousness and uneasiness about India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi was also seen in his speech
 imran ke bhaashan main jo shabd baar baar aayaa, wo tha 'idology' (vichaardhaara)
 Imran used this word 23 times in his speech
 duusare number par imran ne 'kashmir' kaa 20 baar zikr kiya
 Imran mentions the word 'people' 14 times
 haalanki yahaan ek ajeeb baat bhi dikhi
 Instead of the people of Pakistan, Imran in his speech mentioned the people of 'kashmir' 17-18 times
 imran ne 'pakistan' shabd kaa istemaal 12 baar kiya jo bhaashan main bole gaye ‘kashmir’ shabd se kaafii kam tha
 This did not show in PM Modi's speech, he took the name of India more often than any geographical region
 imran ne 'kashmir' kaa kai baar naam lene ke saath hi piem modi, rashtriya swayan sevak sangh (aresas) par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Imran compared the ideology of Modi and the RSS with Hitler's Nazi government
 imran ne 'bharat' kaa naam 11 baar apane bhaashan main liya
 He took the name of 'pakistan' more than once, ie 12 times
 imran ke bhaashan main 'aresas' 7 baar, 'modi' 7 baar or 'naaji' 6 baar aayaa
 Imran also did this on Wednesday
 imran ne aresas vichaardhaara or naaji vichaardhaara kii tulana karte hue madras courier ke editor in chif shrenik raav ke lekh 'hitler’s Hindus: The Rise and Rise of India’s Nazi-loving Nationalists' kaa bhi ullekh kiya
 This is the RSS ideology that threatens not just Kashmiris or Pakistan or even just Indian Muslims, Christians and Dalits but India itself as envisaged by its Founding Fathers
 https: / / t
 co / xn1ctcbrwj — Imran Khan (@imrankhanpti) August 14, 2019 What was there in Modi's speech? PM Modi's Independence Day speech on Thursday gave the word Citizen the most 47 times
 iske baad 'swatantraaa' (30), 'pani' (24), 'garib' (17), 'aatankwaad' (16), kisaan (15) 'anuchhed 370' (14) or 'paryaton'(13) or sena (10) kaa zikr aayaa
 The words that were most frequently mentioned in Modi's speech also show a glimpse of Modi's vision associated with them
 jaise ki modi ne sabhi ke liye peyajal uplabdh karaane ke mishan 'jal jivan' kaa zikr kiya to 'pani' shabd kaa bhaashan main bahut baar istemaal kiya
 3 on this mission
 5 lakh karod rupye kharch kiye jaaenge
 Similarly, he used the word 'poor' 17 times in his speech while talking about welfare schemes for the people living below the poverty line
 anuchhed 370 or 35e ko hataane kaa ullekh bhi modi ke bhaashan main hua
 PM Modi urged Indian citizens to visit at least 15 tourist destinations by 2022
 isiilie 'paryaton' shabd bhi unke bhaashan main kai baar aayaa
 PM Modi mentioned in the speech that not only India but also its neighbors have suffered from terrorism
 haalanki unhone apane bhaashan main pakistan kaa naam lene se parhez kiya
 He did not say anything about Imran Khan
 'kahani 2' kaa pehali 'kahani' se koi taalluk nahin he, sivaay iske ki is film ke nirdeshak sujoy ghosh hai
 The main character stars Vidya Balan and Arjun Rampal
 yah movie ek suspence thriller he or film ke prati utsukata paidaa karne ke liye ye teen vajah kaaphi hai
 The story of 'kahaani' is Haidya Sinhaki who is living a happy life with her daughter in Chandanpur, a small town near Kolkata
 vidya kii beti chal phir nahin sakati he phir bhi maa-beti khush hai
 Mother's only wish is that her daughter gets treatment and she starts walking once again
 apni beti ke ilaaj ke liye vidya use america le jane kii taiyaari karti he or tabhi ek din vidya kii beti mini kidanap ho jaati he
 At the same time, Vidya becomes an accident and she goes into a coma
 iske baad entry hoti he sab inspector indrajit singh
 This then begins the reveal between Vidya Sinha and Durga Rani Singh
 parat pe parat khulti he or aakhirkaar maa apni beti se mil paati he yaa nahin ye aapakomovie dekhneke baad pataa chalegaa
 The beginning of the screenplay film starts in a very interesting way and the story manages to keep you hooked till the interval
 lekin interval ke baad kahani kii raftaar thodi dhimi ho jaati he
 The climax of weak linkwriters Sujoy Ghosh and Suresh Nair is a bit cumbersome
 ye ek suspence thriller he isliye film ke bare main zyada bataanaa galat hoga lekin pehali 'kahani' kii tulana main'kahani 2' kaa clymexthoda kamjor or filmi lagata he
 Vidya Balan is the life of 'kahaani 2' in terms of acting
 har ek seen unhone bakhubi nibhaayaa he or kuch jagahon par wo yakeen dilaa detii hai ki wo adaakara nahin balki durga rani singh hai
 Arjun Rampal has also done extremely natural work and has given good support to Vidya
 jugal hansraj or baaki sabhi kalakaar apane kirdaaron main feet rahe hai
 The film's strong linkage is Basu's cinematography, Subrata Barik's production design and background music are excellent
 nirdeshak sujoy ghosh ek baar phir kolkata or kelingpong ko kahani main kirdaar banane main safal hote hai
 Overall 'kahaani 2' is slightly less than the first 'kahaani' but still manages to leave its mark
 america ne jammu-kashmir ke pulavama jile main hue aatankwaadi hamale kii shuukravaar ko ninda karte hue sabhi deshon se aatankwaadiyon ko surakshit panaah or samarthan nahin dene kii apil kii

 Psychologists associate dreams with desire
 antarrashtriya khyaati praapt manovaigyanik singmund frid ne manushya man kii gahan ichha ko ‘livido’ kaha tha
 Modern psychologists describe dreams as the result of deep desire
 ek taaja soochna ke anusaar, vaigyanik sapanom ke niyantran tak pahunch gaye hai
 Experiments have been done by putting the brain under the influence of special level electric waves
 vaigyanikon kaa daawa he ki vidyut jatke se swapn roke ja sakate hai
 But the desire to be carved into the moving dream sequences has still not been interpreted
 misr ke ek adhyayan main swapn main aae drishyon kaa arth samajhane par kaaphi parishram hua he
 There is a surprising mention of such a study of Egypt in the Dictionary of Dreams
 iske mul siddhant bhartiya chintan se milte julate hai
 According to Freud, all dreams are the result of our desire
 atharvaveda main kaam devtaa ko swapnsrjak kaha gaya he
 Here the poem is called the daughter of Kama
 misr ke pehle upanishad darshan main bhi swapnon ko samajhane kii baari koshish kii gai he
 Half of Freud is true
 adhikansh swapn hamaari ichha kaa hi srijan hote hai
 The mind creates another world
 ham swapn sansar ke paatr hote hai
 The dream world is fun
 kabhi khubasurat, van, upavan, to kabhi sookhe ped
 Many dreams are proved right the next day
 frid or aadhunik manovigyaan ke vivechan main aise swapnon kaa ullekh nahin he
 In the 'dictionary of Dreams', there is a great explanation for seeing snakes in dreams
 kaala saanp dekhnaa bhavishya main ksht degaa or swarna jaisaa pilaa saanp aakasmik laabh
 One can call it superstition
 lekin swapn dekhakar padhanaa or padhakar samajhnaa andhvishwaas nahin ho saktaa
 Are dreams informing the future also the result of our desire? Is Freud's 'livido' also responsible for such dreams? In the Dictionary of Dreams, such special dreams are said to be the result of being connected to the entire cosmic consciousness
 manushya sampoorn astitv kaa bhaag he
 But there is also the unit
 gahan nidra kii dashaaen bhi kam se kam do prakaar kii hai
 Only life moves in complete sleep
 hamaara indriya bodh shunya ho jaataa he, man prashanth ho jaataa he
 There is an idea in Indian thought that the mind also changes in life
 tab koi swapn nahin hote
 We dream while awake
 iskaa kaaran man he
 The Pacific mind remains dreamless during sleep
 patanjali yoga sutron main man kii samaapti par jor diya gaya he
 There is an idea that the mind survives but does not move
 sach jo bhi ho lekin swapnheen nidra badi urja detii he
 In the beginning of sleep, the senses of the eyes, ears, nose etc
 are relaxed, these are the tools of the mind
 indriyon kii shithilataa ke baad man ke paas vichaar bachate hai
 Dreams in this state are the result of desire
 lekin man ke shithil hone se chetana kabhi-kabhi brahmadia chetana se jud jaati he
 Then the dreams are not the result of our desire
 ve brahm gati kii jhaanki hote hai
 Cosmos or totality shows the picture
 sambhavat: samshti vyashti ke chitt ko chitramay karti he
 Some dreams are true and many are meaningless
 atharvaveda ke pippalad-shakhiya brahman kaa ek bhaag he- prashnopanishad
 The Question Question Council is unique
 yahaan aasthaa nahin prashnon kii bechaini he
 In the legend, 6 sages asked Piplad Rishi one question each
 chauthaa prashn mjedaar he
 Gragya asked, 'in the deep sleep, which divine powers reside within humans? Who keeps awake? Who sees these events in a dream? Who enjoys pleasure in sleep? ”piplad replied,“ At the time of sleep all the senses - the divine powers dissolve in the mind, so the soul does not listen, smell, nor taste, nor touch, Does not speak praan agni hi jaagti rahati he
 In the dream state, the individual experiences his glory through the mind and the subtle senses - 'swapne Mahimanam
 ’yahaan mahima shabd dhyaan dene yogya he
 Glory is the representative of perfection, desire is personal, desire creates dream but glory is visible
 aage kehete hai, ‘swapn main yah dev (main yaa ham) dekhe hue sune hue naanaa deshon, dishaao ko baar-baar dekhtaa he
 He sees and hears neither the heard nor the heard
 anubhav kiye hue ko anubhav karata he, anubhav na kiye hue ko bhi anubhav karata he- anubhutham ananubhutham c
 'there is a treasure of scenes seen in the mind and brain
 dekhe gaye drishyon kaa swapn main doharaav samaj main aata he
 Visuals present in the brain can reappear in the dream state
 hamane gaay dekhi he, chita or bhaaluu bhi
 It is possible to see the face of a bear instead of a cow's mouth in a dream
 man kosh main donon ke chitra hai
 Such scenes are concocted
 man ke rache yaa gadhe hue swapn
 Guidance is a simple and simple word, but deep in its original meaning
 maarg hamaari gatishiltaa kaa paryaay he or darshan he maarg kaa gahan anubhav
 'anubhutam ananabhutam' of the Upanishads
 anubhoot saral he, anubhav main aane ke kaaran
 Uncomplicated complex
 prakhyat brahmad vigyaani stephen hawkings ne samay kaa gahan vivechan kiya he
 It is said that can we make such a high speed vehicle? Who can reach the future, running faster than the present due to his speed? Perhaps it is possible
 vartmaan or bhavishya agar samay ke bhaag hai to vartmaan se bhaagate hue bhavishya main chalaang lagane kii aashaa vyarth nahin
 Hawkings is a physicist
 ve tej raftaar vaahan kii sochate hai
 Isn't the mind such a vehicle? The mind of the awakened state also reaches America, England, France or Akash Chandra in less than a moment
 is samay ko bhi ghataya ja saktaa he
 There is no difficulty in getting caught up in the mess of the senses in front of the mind during sleep
 sambhav he ki yahi man apni atitivr gati main vartmaan kaa atikaraman kar bhavishya main pahunch jaataa ho or yahi man bhavishya kii ghatnaon ko bhi dikhaata ho
 In the Atharvaveda, Bhrigu has rightly said that 'the mind is within time
 ’ man kaal ke teenon ayaamon main awajahi karata he- bhoot main jaataa he to smriti
 Aspiration goes into the future
 ichha vaale swapn frid kii vyakhya ke bheetar hai, lekin gahan nidra main akele apni masti main yahi man aakanksha, ichha kii seemaa ke paar jaakar bhavishya ke bhi drishy dikhaata ho to aashcharya kya he? lekin aashcharya he bhi

 - input bhashaa After becoming Congress President, Rahul Gandhi is soon going to step towards the biggest change in his party
 sutron ke mutabik, congress kii sabase badi faisla lene vaali body 'kaarysmiti' ko rahul aane vaale dinon main bhang karne vaale hai
 That is, the working committee formed during the tenure of Sonia Gandhi will now be re-constituted under Rahul's tenure
 kaarysmiti kii baithak 17 farvari kosutron ke mutabik,rahul gandhi prakriya ke tahat ab congress kii puraani kaarysmiti ko bhang karne kaa man bana liya he
 There will be a meeting of this old working committee on February 17, in which the date of the convention will be stamped
 iske baad jaldi hi congress kaarysmiti bhang ho jaaegi
 There is also a possibility that after the decision on the date of the session, the entire working committee itself should offer the resignation saying that a new working committee of the new chairman is to be formed
 takneekee taur par kaarysmiti bhang hote hi vah stearing cameti main tabdeel ho jaaegi, jo agle maheene 17-18 march ko dilli main sambhavit party ke adhiveshan tak kaaryvahak taur par bani rahegi
 However, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh has proposed to hold a session in Mohali before the high command

 These include the PNB scam

 According to sources, there will be an electoral process of 12 members of the working committee on the lines of the election of Rahul Gandhi's party president, but in the case of filling the nomination of only 12 people, there was hardly any voting
 baaki 12 sadasyon ko rahul khud manonith karenge
 In this way, a new working committee of Congress will be formed in the session
 sutron kaa maananaa he ki isamen se kai puraane sadasyon kii chuttee hogi to kuch puraane sadsy barkaraar bhi rahenge, lekin kai nae sadasyon kii entry bhi hogi, jinhen rahul kaa kareebi mana jaataa he
 Team Rahul is constantly consulting with names and opinions, but the final decision on the names has still not been done
 kul milakar kaarysmiti kaa gathan hote hi rahul gandhi kii team saamne aa jaaegi or congress sanghathan main sonia gandhi kaa siyaasi yug samaapt ho jayega
 sp's Rajya Sabha MP from UP Chaudhary Munawwar Salim has given a big statement regarding the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya
 unhone buudhvaar ko eta main apane ek bayaan main kaha ki ram mandir bharat main hi banegaa or koi maai kaa laal mandir banane se nahin roak saktaa
 Salim had come to meet the party workers of Etah as district in-charge
 kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhan ke dauraan mandir nirmaan ko lekar puche gaye sawaal par munwwar saleem ne kaha, 'ram mandir agar hindustan main nahin banegaa to kahaan banegaa? or koun maai kaa laal ram mandir banane se rokegaa
 The Rajya Sabha MP further said that even in a Muslim country like Malaysia, there are many Ram temples
 aise main agar hindustan main ram mandir nahin banegaa to kahaan banegaa? vahiin, jab unase ayodhya main mandir nirmaan sawaal kiya gaya to unhone kaha ki hindustan main ram mandir kahin bhi ban saktaa he
 Munavvar Salim praising Lord Rama said, 'lohia used to say that a human being is alive not by idols, but by recoveries
 ram kaa jivan unki maryaada, unke adarsh, unka sarvasamaj ko lekar chalane ke liye yaad kiya jaataa he
 Even under his rule, the common man had the right to ask questions to the queen
 ' unhone kaha ki musalamaanon ke netaa allamaa ikbaal ne ram ke bare main kaha tha 'he ram ke vajood pe hindostaan ko naaj, ahale najar usko samajhate hai imaame hind
 'munawwar Salim has claimed that SP was the first to accept Ram Rajya
 unhone kaha ki sapa hi bhagwaan ram or bhagwaan krishna ke aadarshon par chalane vaali akeli party he
 On the appointment of Kalyan Singh as the Governor of Rajasthan, he said that it is unfortunate for the convicted person to be given the responsibility of constitutional post

 The meeting of Donald Trump and Narendra Modi, which is being described as the biggest meeting of this year, was eyeing the whole world
 america raashtrapati donald trump, apni patni melania trump ke saath white house ke daravaaje par narendra modi kaa intjaar karte dikhe
 Both of them were very hospitable to Modi
 lekin is dauraan ek aisa vakya hua jo soshal media par charchaa kaa vishay bana rahaa
 What happened? congress party ke varisht netaa jairam ramesh ne purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ke rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (RSS) ke mukhyalay jane or kaarykram main shaamil hone par sawaal uthaae hai
 On Saturday, former Union Minister Jairam Ramesh said that the purpose and reference of former President Pranab Mukherjee to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) headquarters in June last year was wrong
 unhone yah bhi daawa kiya ki narendra modi sarkaar banane ke baad se pandit jawaharlal nehru kii viraasat par vyavasthit dhang se hamale ho rahe hai, lekin desh ke pratham pradhanmantri ko itihaas se kabhi nahin mitaayaa ja saktaa
 Former Union Minister Ramesh was speaking on the occasion of the release of a book titled 'nehru-myth and Truth'
 patrkaar piyush babele is pustak ke lekhak hai
 In response to a question related to Pranab Mukherjee's visit to Nagpur, Jairam Ramesh said, 'at that time i wrote a letter to Mukherjee and i said that i hoped that he would not go to Nagpur
 iske baad se unke or mere bich sambandh nahin rahe
 i have not met them and they have not even called me
 haalanki maine unke saath 25 saal tak kaam kiya he
 He said, 'the background and context in which he visited Nagpur was wrong
 nagpur kai log gaye hai
 It is not that there was no contact between the Congress and the RSS
 gohatya par roak ke liye kanoon banane ke sandarbh main jo samiti bani thi, usamen indira gandhi or RSS ke tatkaaleen sar sangh kaarywah madhav sadashiv golwalkar ko shaamil kiya tha
 i do not think there is anything wrong with the contact, but the purpose and context in which he (pranab Mukherjee) went to Nagpur raises many questions
 lihaaja maine uskaa samarthan nahin kiya tha
 Jairam Ramesh said, 'if Pranab Mukherjee spoke about the real face of RSS, then it would have been right
 agar wo is maukey par kehete ki aresas kaa itihaas galat he, to main maanata ki wo bade saahsee hai
 He should have spoken about Sardar Patel's view of RSS, but he spoke of unity in diversity, multi-religion and multi-lingual country
 ye baaten to sab jaanate hai
 There is no need to go to Nagpur for this
 ’aapako bataa den ki pichley saal june main aresas ke ek kaarykram mempranab mukherjeebataur mukhya atithi shaamil hue the
 At that time many Congress leaders including his daughter Sharmishtha Mukherjee had raised questions about his visit
 pustak vimochan ke maukey par desh ke pratham pradhanmantri pandit nehru ke desh main yogadan kaa ullekh karte hue ramesh ne kaha, ‘pichley kuch varshon se, khaskar 2014 se pandit nehru kii viraasat or unki uplabdhiyon par vyavasthit dhang se hamale ho rahe hai
 The publicity being propagated about him is 100 percent wrong
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘nehru ko itihaas se mitaane kii koshish ho rahi he, lekin nehru or unki viraasat kabhi nahin mit sakate hai
 ' har ladki apni shaadi main sabase khubasurat dikhnaa chaahati he
 For this, the right makeup is very important
