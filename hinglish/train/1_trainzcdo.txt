 Some like to hang out with people and some like to be alone
 koi kam bolta he to koi zyada, koi bedadak he to koi sharmila
 It has often been seen that people with shy temperament tend to lag behind people who speak more in terms of love
 magar iske baavjood unki sambhaavnaaen puri tarah se khatm nahin hoti hai
 Shy people always hesitate to take a girl on a date
 saath hi wo aksar pyaar kaa izhaar karne se bhi ghabaraate hai
 But if they bring some changes in their behavior, then this problem can be overcome in a pinch
 aaie jaanate hai aise hi kuch tips jise apana kar sharmile log bhi pyaar ke maamle main safal sabit ho sakate hai
 The clutch of lakhs came to the party, Sara Ali Khan being self-confident - It is believed that shy people lack confidence, due to which they hesitate when talking to anyone
 agar wo confident hone kii koshish karen to unki aadhi pareshaani dur ho sakati he
 This will generate interest in the person and the conversation will start in a rhythm
 baatcheet kaa shuru hona ek acha sanket he
 Funny Style - Boys are more likable for girls than joking
 kai dfa ye bhi dekha gaya he ki kam bolne vaale logon kaa sens of humar bahut acha hota he
 If you have these qualities in you, then this is a plus point, if not, then you should try to make the atmosphere funny in a light way
 isaki shuruyaat aap khud ke upar joke maar ke bhi kar sakate hai
 If you succeed in making the person in front laugh, then the path ahead can be easier for you
 shighrapatan or stambhan dosha waalon ke liye vardaan he ye eksrasijataarif karen-ladakiyon ko tarif sunanaa acha lagata he
 If you compliment their dress or looks then they get pleasure
 aap bhi baton-baton main aisi hi kuch tarif kiijie
 This will also make the front person more comfortable towards you
 aage ke liye approach karnaa naa bhoolen-aapaki date jaisi bhi rahi ho aap agali date ke bare main bhi poochne se naa ghabaraaen
 Chances will only remain when you will be able to meet that person again
 ho saktaa ho ki saamne vaale shaks ko aapkaa saath acha laga ho or wo aapke saath or vakt bitaane main icchhuk hon
 In the second meeting, you can also overcome the shortcomings of the first time
 iske alaava aapako us shaks ke or kareeb aane kaa mauka milegaa

 bhavishya main isaki jarurat pad sakati he
 On one hand, the ashram of Baba Virendra Dev Dixit is constantly in the eyes of the police, on the other hand, a huge wall has been drawn between the devotees and followers of Virendra Dixit about Baba
 aapako sunaate hai banda ke ek parivaar ke do bhaaiyon kii kahani, jiske do bhaibaba virendra dev dikshitko lekar alag-alag raah pakad chuke hai
 Aajtak's team visited Kalmodi village in Banda
 us gaanv main bhaiyalaal kushvaha or babulal kushvaha do bhaaiyon kaa parivaar mila or in donon bhaaiyon or unke pariwaron kii ladakiyon ne ek dashak se zyada baba virendra dev dikshit ke ashramon main guzaara he
 Bhaiya Lal Kushwaha brought his wife-in-law and daughter out of the ashram, while the Babulal Kushwaha family is still associated with the ashram and with equally unwavering faith
 bhaiyalaal ke parivaar ne apane ghar kii ladakiyon or duusare sadasyon ko ashram ke naam kar diya he or baba virendra dev dikshit ke timaardaari main guzaar diya he
 Now the same family is revealing Virendra Dev Dixit with demon-like words after the revelations on Baba
 bhaiya laal kushvaha kehete hai kivirendra dikshit, insaan ke vesh main shaitan he, jo khud ko bhagwaan maanata he
 There are wrong things in his ashram
 bhaiya laal ke mutabikvirendra dikshitke bare main ashram kii mahilaon ne bataaya ki uske ladakiyon se galat rishte hote hai, jo khud ko bhagwaan bataakar karata he
 Bhaiyyalal is so angry with Virendra Dixit that now he has roamed from village to village, to open the pole of the hypocritical Baba
 bhaiyalaal chaahate hai ki baba ko kadi se kadi sajaa mili
 In this Kanmudi village, Bhaiyya Lal Kushwaha's brother is Babulal Kushwaha, who is still a blind devotee of Virendra Dev Dixit
 unke mutabik virendra dev dikshit insaan nahin bhagwaan he or bhagwaan jab insaan ke vesh main hote hai to unki pariksha lee jaati he or is samay unki pariksha kaa daur chal rahaa he
 In the future, the world will believe that he is God
 baharhaal, banda ke kai gaanvon main inke bhakt parivaar hai, jisaki darjanon ladkiyaan unke alag-alag ashramon main rahati hai
 After the raids on Baba, there is concern among these families and there is curiosity in the area that Virendra Dev Dixit's fate may not be like Baba Ram Rahim's
 naaballig se balaatkaar ke aaropon main jail main band asaram ko supreme court ne ek baar phir jamaanat dene se inkaar kar diya he
 The next hearing of the case will now be held on 28 November
 naaballig se balaatkaar ke aaropon main jail main band asaram ko philhal supreme court se koi raahat milti najar nahin aa rahi he
 Hearing Asaram's bail application on Monday, the court refused to grant Asaram bail
 sunwaayee ke dauraan gujarat sarkaar neasaramki jamaanat kaa purajor virodh kiya
 The state government told the Supreme Court that day-to-day trials are to be conducted in the Ahmedabad rape case
 6 maheene main trial kii prakriya puri hogi
 Therefore, the accused Asaram should not be granted bail
 jiske baad adaalat ne maamle kii agali sunwaayee 28 november tay kii
 Explain that Asaram's lawyers had sought bail citing his ill health
 gauratlab he ki asaram apane hi ashram kii ek naaballig ladki se balaatkaar ke maamle main jail main band hai
 Asaram had earlier also sought interim bail of 1 to 2 months on health grounds
 jiske baad supreme court ne unki swasthya jaanch ke liye medical board banane kaa aadesh diya tha
 Asaram's lawyers told the court that the media trial is going on in this case, so the court should stop the media report
 lekin court ne aisa karne se manaa kar diya
 The central government and the Congress are face to face with the appointment of Lokpal
 loksabhaa main congress ke netaa mallikarjun khadge ne centre sarkaar ke us nimantran ko thukraa diya he, jisamen unhen lokapal niyukti ko lekar hone vaali baithak main bulaayaa gaya tha
 The appointment of the Lokpal is only today
 bataa den ki 5 march se sansad kaa bajet satr kaa doosraa bhaag shuru ho rahaa he
 In fact, the objection of the Congress is that in the meeting called for the selection of Lokpal, Kharge has been called as a special invitee in place of the Leader of Opposition
 mallikarjun khadge ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko chitthee likhakar aarope lagaaya he ki centre sarkaar vipaksh kii baat nahin sun rahi he
 The Opposition is not being given a chance to speak
 khadge ne likhaa ki pradhanmantri modi kaa bataur gujarat ke mukhyamantri jo trek record he vah bataata he ki vah lokapal jaisi sanstha ke bare main syrius nahin hai
 With this stance of the Congress, the crisis over the appointment of Lokpal has once again come under threat
 sansad satr ke shuru hone ke chaar din pehle hi sarkaar ne lokapal ke liye chayan samiti kii baithak bulaai he taaki lokapal ke naam par sahmati banaai ja sake
 The Lokpal's selection committee comprises PM Modi, Speaker of Lok Sabha Sumitra Mahajan, Chief Justice of the country and Congress leader in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge (special Guest)
 khadge ne likhaa ki agar is baithak main meraa vot, vichaar or tark myne nahin hoga to bataur 'special guest' baithak main shaamil hone kaa koi auchity nahin he
 He said that the Congress government had passed the Lokpal bill, but despite that the Modi government has not been able to appoint the Lokpal till date
 aapako bataa den kilokapal bilko 13 disambar 2013 ko rajyasabha main pesh kiya gaya tha, jo 17 disambar 2013 ko paarit ho gaya tha
 After this, the bill was also passed by the Lok Sabha on 18 December 2013
 iske baad 18 disambar ko piem modi (us dauraan gujarat siem) ne twit kar is bill ko paarit karaane kaa shrey sushamaa swaraj or arun jetali ke saath bijepi saansadon ko diya tha
 It is worth noting that in 2011, there was a big movement in Delhi's Ramlila Maidan under the leadership of Anna Hazare
 jiske baad lokapal bill charchaa main aayaa tha
 After this, on 27 August 2011, the resolution was passed in the Indian Parliament from 'sense of the House'
 isamen centre main lokapal or har rajyon main lokayukta va citijan charter par jald se jald kanoon banane kaa nirnay kiya gaya tha
 After this, Anna Hazare postponed his agitation
 netaji subhash chandra bose or azaad hind fouz kii viraasat ko itihaas se mitaane kii sochi samajhi koshish kii gai he
 Amid reports of alleged spying of Netaji's relatives, his nephew Ardhendu Bose has alleged this
 mumbai ke posh kolaba ilaake main rahane vaale aradhendu ne enditivi india ke saath khaas baatcheet main ye bhi bataaya ki varli sthit unke ghar main aane vaale kai khaton kii bhi pehle jaanch kii jaati thi
 Ardhendu also said that his father had told him that the phones of many of his relatives living in Kolkata were tapped
 mumbai se chamade kaa kaarobaar karne vaale aradhendu ne kaha, ‘1947 ke baad se netaji subhash chandra bose ke saath azaad hind fouj ke naam or kaam ko mitaane kii puri koshish kii gai he, itihaas kii kisi bhi kitaab main bose, indian neshnal army kaa zikr nahin he
 'mumbai-born Ardhendu has been a former model of Bombay Dyeing
 unke pita shailesh chandra netaji ke chote bhai the, jinka 1984 main nidhan ho gaya tha
 Ardhendu says that his family believes this, which was also confirmed by the Mukherjee commission during Vajpayee's prime minister that there was no plane crash on 18 August 1945
 netaji, kolkata-afghanistan ke raste shaayad rus gaye the lekin stallin ne shaayad apane doorgaami phaaydon ke liye unhen siberia bhej diya jahaan 1957 ke aasapaas unki maut ho gai
 Ardhendu wants Prime Minister Narendra Modi to remove all documents related to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose from the Gupta list so that the entire country can know about Netaji and the truth related to his death
 isi mudde par netaa ji ke pote surya bose ne berlin main pradhanmantri narendra modi se mulaakaat bhi kii
 Mani Shankar Aiyar said that it would be best if Rahul Gandhi continues as party president, but at the same time Rahul's wishes should be respected
 unhone kaha, 'main aashwast hum ki party kaa adhyaksh koi nehru-gandhi na ho tab bhi hamaara astitv kaayam rahegaa, basharte nehru-gandhi parivaar party main sakriy rahe or aise sankat kaa samaadhaan nikaalane main madad kare jahaan gambhir matbhed utpann hon
 The senior Congress leader said that Rahul Gandhi has given a month's time to find some other option for the post of President and talks are going on within the Congress on this issue where most of the people in the party are in favor of Rahul's continuation
 Are in haalanki purv kendriya mantri ne is baat par jor diya ki media ko atakalein lagane kii bajaae yah jaanane ke liye 'antim samay seemaa' kaa intjaar karnaa chahie ki kya koi vikalp mil gaya he yaa rahul ko congress adhyaksh bane rahane ke liye manaa liya gaya he

 Trinamool Congress leaders have recently described BJP leader Mukul Roy as a traitor
 mukul roy iske pehle trinmul congress ke mahatvapurn netaa the
 The party refused to attach any importance to Mukul Roy's involvement with the BJP and said he was a 'traitor' and had no popularity among the people

 unhone daawa kiya ki pashchim bengal kii janata mukhyamantri mamata banerjee kaa vikalp chaahati he or vah agle chunaav main bhaajapa ke paksh main vot degi
 Mukul Roy was already suspended by TMC for 6 years

 His name first came in the Saradha scam and CBI is also questioning Mukul in this case
 mukul kii giraftaar rokane ke liye khud mamata banerjee ne bayaan dena shuru kiya tha or unhone is maamle ke liye centre kii modi sarkaar ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha
 Farhad Hakim, another Trinamool Congress leader and a member of the state cabinet, advised Roy not to dream of overthrowing the Trinamool government in the next assembly election, according to him as it would prove to be a nightmare for him
 hakim ne kaha, 'vah aise gaddaar hai jinhone pashchim bengal ke logon ke saath vishwasghaat kiya
 He will not cause any harm to the Trinamool
 hamaari party kii kaman mamata ke haathon main he
 It is good to dream, there is no harm in that, but their dreams do not turn into nightmares

 haal hi main ek fishan sho main aamir se poocha gaya tha ki vah is sho kaa hissaa kyon nahin ban rahe
 On this, Aamir said that Karan is not calling him on the show
 lagata he aamir ke is ishare ke baad karan ko saaf ho gaya ki aksar film pramotion ke liye tivi sho aadi se dur rahane vaale aamir 'dangal' ke liye is sho par aane ko taiyaar hai
 It is clear that the presence of the three Khans in this show of Karan is going to prove to be very good for his show
 jab se aamir film dangal kaa pramotion kar rahe hai, vah apni onscreen donon betiyon ke bina kahin nahin jate hai
 This is the reason that Aamir will also appear with him on this show as well

 for film promotion, is ready to come on this show for 'dangal'
 isse saaf he ki karan ke is sho main teenon khaanon kii maujuudagi unke sho ke liye kaaphi acchhee sabit hone vaali hai

 Valentines Day is the day of the express of love
 jaahir he har koi apane vailentin ko gulab kaa najarana pesh kar khush karnaa chahta he
 In such a situation, who cares about how loose the pocket is when buying roses
 'lav iconomics' main notebandi kaa kya kaam?gulab kii itani demand he to phool bechney waalon ke chehre bhi gulab jaise hi khile hue hai
 However, why not this time of the year is the highest earning
 baat izhaar-e-muhabbat kii he to notebandi kii kya bisaat jo iske raste main diwaar ban sake
 Who cares about the price of giving a gift rose to Valentin or something else? is 'lav iconomics' ko or koi jaanata ho yaa naa jaanata ho, kaarobaari bakhubi jaanate hai
 Nadia district of West Bengal is known for rose cultivation
 is jile main bhi nadia dhantala kaa kshetra khaas taur par prasiddh he
 The joy of rose demand can be seen on the faces of the growers here
 abu mandal naam ke kisaan ne kaha, 'gulabon ke daam 80 rupye tak bad gaye hai
 In the last two years, rose prices have not been so high this season
 is saal munafa pichley do saal kii tulana main kahin adhik rahegaa
 According to another farmer, Adhir Mandal, Gulab is being sold indiscriminately even after being priced at Rs 80
 beete saal tak utpaadak gulab kii bikri se salanaa do lakh rupye tak kama lete the
 But now the demand for roses has increased so much that on a few days, up to Rs 40,000 is sold in a single day
 pichley kuch saal main gulab utpaadakon kaa munafa 40 se 45 fisadi tak badha he
 As far as the impact of demonetisation is concerned, rose producer Saumitra Basu says that whether demonetisation or increase in cost of production, it has not affected the sale of roses
 badi sankhya main booking mili he
 Emotion or pretense? On the one hand, rose is the silver of the growers, on the other hand, some people believe that buying roses at such a high price is a mere show of love
 bipasha mukherjee khan kaa kahana he ki agrim booking ke dauraan gulab ke liye 20-30 rupye bataae jate hai
 But by the time of delivery, the rose price rises to Rs 90 to 110

 Businessman Sanjay Modak says, 'we should celebrate Valentine's Day to express our feelings
 lekin jis tarah ye manaaya jaataa he uske main khilaaf hum
 People do not think even once when buying a rose of 80 rupees
 is din main bhautikatavaadi mulyon ko kam se kam bich main aane dena chahie
 Bipasha Chakraborty, who works in a private firm, said, "it is not mandatory that roses be presented on Valentine's Day
" agar ek duusare ke bare main aap kya sochate hai, ise jubaan se bhi kah diya jaae to bhi utana hi asar karata he
 Years ago, when people did not give roses, did love have less effect or was it not appreciated
 aajkal dikhaava zyada he
 Giving roses is not wrong, but competing against the best is against the unshakable spirit of love
 'lekin janaab, ye sab dimag kii baaten hai
 Love speaks of the heart, not of the mind
 muhabbat or jang main sab jaij he to gulabon kii prise-war se bhi dil waalon ko kya pareshaani he?har gulab ke alag mynegulab ke rang or khushboo ke myne bhi alag-alag bataae jate hai
 The yellow rose means that the couple's bond will always be unbreakable like cement

 Supporting the demand to reduce the age limit for adolescent boys in the wake of the Delhi gang rape case, Chief Minister Sheila Dikshitne said that the nature of crime should not be ignored while deciding the age issue

 dilli police ne apane aaropapatr main chathe aaropee ko 'sabase barbar' kaha he
 Referring to the demands of the family of a girl victim of gang rape in the juvenile age limit incident, the Chief Minister wondered if it would be appropriate to forgive her only for being a juvenile delinquent
 shila ne kaha, ‘mata-pita aaropee ke liye sajaa kii maang kar rahe hai
 What they are saying is that of all the people involved in the incident, he (kishore) was the most violent
 kya ham sirf uske kishor vay ke kaaran use maafee dena kabool kar sakate hai
 What did he do that an adult cannot do
 ’ kishor adaalat ke is faisle ke kaaran aaropee kishor is varsh ke chaar june ko 18 varsh kaa hone ke baad reeha ho saktaa he
 The victim's family has expressed unhappiness over the juvenile court's decision and said that they will challenge the verdict in the court so that the accused can be sentenced to death
 peedita ke bhai kaa kahana he, ‘parivaar chathe aaropee ke liye maut kii sajaa se kam kuch bhi sweekaar nahin karegi
 The Chief Minister said that the government will have to take a decision after closely examining its various aspects
 unhone kaha, ‘bahes chal rahi he ki yadi ek kishor aisa aparaadh kar saktaa he to kya vah kishor hi he? duusari bahes he ki ek kishor ko tabhi nirdosh mana ja saktaa he jab use pataa naa ho ki vah kya kar rahaa he
 Sheila, who has been critical of the police's work and demanded the resignation of Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar after the gang rape incident, said that the public should have faith in it rather than fearing the police
 unhone kaha, ‘janata main police ke prati vishwaas or use janata kaa madadgaar maanane kii bhaavana utpann honi chahie
 Police training, their language and their work etc
 should be improved
 yah samgr drushtikon he taaki log darane ke sthaan par vishwaas karen

 The flesh of the animal who is sacrificed is shared to increase social harmony between family, friends, and poor families who cannot afford to sacrifice the animal

 To remind a sacrifice in the path of Allah, a goat, sheep or cow is usually sacrificed

 The people of Dhaka used parking lots, garages and narrow streets to sacrifice animals

 There is no proper drainage system in a city of one crore population, due to which floods are a common problem here

 Do you remember the name of an officer associated with the women's organization of a political party in the state? Have you seen the picture of any leader associated with women's organization in the big hoardings of the party engaged in squares, mohallas? Do you remember any big events of these women's organizations recently? Probably your answer will be in 'no'
 yah hakeekat bhi he
 The position of their women's branches within the Alambardar parties to get half the state's rights is not very good
 vah pahchaan ke sankat se to guzar hi rahi hai, party ke bheetar bhi unhen jaruri tavajjo nahin mil rahi
 First the Samajwadi Mahila Sabha, the women's wing of Samajwadi Party, the main opposition party of the state, discusses
 adhyaksh leelavati kushvaha ke netritv main uski 41 sadasyeey pradesh kaaryakarini he
 In more than half of the districts, this organization is undergoing reconstruction
 nai jila adhyaksh tainaat karke unhen nai mahila cametiyaan gathit karne kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya he
 In July, activists of the Samajwadi Mahila Sabha protested on the streets of the capital against inflation, in which male leaders of the party also participated
 iske baad se jila str par chhitput dharne-pradarshan ko chhod sapa ke mahila sanghathan ne siyaasi halkon main koi upasthiti nahin darj karai he
 But Kushwaha believes, "mahila Sabha officials are constantly campaigning to connect women with the party
 '' beete dinon samaajawaadee party ke kisi bhi bade kaarykram main yaa in dinon pradesh main gum rahe sapa pradesh adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ke kranti rath par, kahin sapa mahila sabha ke padaadhikariyon ko bade netaaon ke bich jagah nahin di gai
 She was absent from the main events
 lekin kushvaha isse inkaar karti hai or kahati hai, ''netaji (mulaayam singh yadav) ne sabhi kaaryakartaaon kii jimmedaari tay kii he, usee ke anusaar kaam kar rahe hai
 "kushwaha may not accept the matter of neglect, but in the past, many voices of protest have arisen in his organization
 kuch maah pehle unki pradesh upaadhyaksh parveen ayub idarisi ne party par parivaarwaad kaa aarope lagaakar pis party se naata jod liya tha
 "women are given a post in SP," he alleged
 koi jimmedaari nahin di jaati
 After the ticket distribution, the heat of dissatisfaction also appeared in the Samajwadi Women's Branch
 farrukhabad main sabha kii jila adhyaksh sushamaa jatav ne party se istipha de diya
 She was extremely upset at not getting the ticket from Kayamganj safe seat
 unka aarope tha, ''party ne unki 20 saal kii mehnat kaa koi sila nahin diya he
 The SP has completely ignored the Mahila Sabha in the announcement of candidates
 kushvaha ne bhi ayodhya se tikat maanga tha, par unke kaam ko darkinar kar duusare pratyaashee ko tikat diya gaya
 For this reason Ranjana Vajpayee, the fiery leader of the Mahila Sabha, left the party
 beete loksabhaa chunaav main tikat na milane se kshubdh ranjana ne basapa kaa daaman tham liya tha
 The BJP is the first party to give women 33 percent reservation in the organization
 usne puure pradesh ko chah parikshetron-gorakhpur, kaashi, kanpur, avadh, brij or pashchim-main baantkar pradesh str kii mahila padaadhikari ko unka prabhaar diya he
 BJP is the executive of Mahila Morcha at district and mandal level, but at block and panchayat level it is weak in more than half of the districts of the state
 beete june main is mahila ikai ne rajdhani lakhanu samet kareeb sabhi jilon main mahilaon par ho rahe atyaachaar or mahangaai ke mudde par bada pradarshan kiya tha, par uske baad se uski gatividhiyaan shant hai
 The President of the State BJP Mahila Morcha, Dr
 madhu mishra bataati hai, ''philhal mahila morcha kaaryakartaaon ko vidhansabha chunaavon kii taiyaari main lagaaya ja rahaa he
 a team of 3,000 women will be formed in every assembly constituency which will create an atmosphere for the atrocities on women in the BSP government
 ''vaise, party ke paas in sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin he ki jab block or panchayat str par mahila kaaryakarta nahin mil raheen to har vidhansabha kshetra main 3,000 mahila kaaryakarta kaise jutai jaaengi? mahila morcha ke sakriy hone ke baavjood aam janata main ise apekshit pahchaan nahin mil pai he
 In the elections too, women front officials have not been given importance
 beete vidhansabha chunaavon main mahila pratyaashiyon kii sankhya main lagaataar ijapha hota gaya he, lekin mahila sanghathan se judi netaaon kaa pratinidhitiv shunya hi rahaa he
 This time too, the list of 28 women officials desirous of contesting elections by the State Mahila Morcha has been sent to the Central Election Committee, but the possibility of getting any of these tickets is slim
 morcha kii hi ek varisht netaa bataati hai ki party ke bade netaa hi mahilaon ko aage nahin badaae dena chaahate
 All the women who are getting tickets are either relatives of a big leader or close to them
 mahila sanghathan se judin kaaryakartaaon ko aage na badaae dene ko lekar asantosh congress main bhi kam nahin he
 On October 21, the state Women's Congress Committee officials met Congress President Sonia Gandhi and demanded that at least 20 per cent of the women be given tickets in the election
 lekin congress kii ab tak ghoshit 134 ummidavaaron kii suchi main 20 mahila pratyaashiyon ko jagah di gai he
 Of these, only four are old party workers, the rest are leaders from outside
 pradesh congress mahila cameti kii adhyaksh mira singh bataati hai, ''hamane party se aagrah kiya he ki har jile main kam-se-kam ek seat par mahila sanghathan kii netaaon ko utaara jaae
 Many active officials, including Suraiya Siddiqui, Anita Upadhyay, Nutan Vajpayee, associated with the Mahila Committee have submitted claims for tickets
 chunaav main mahila sanghathan ko apekshit bhagidaari na milane par party main asantosh bad saktaa he
 By the way, Chairman of the National Scheduled caste-tribe Commission P
W
 el
 Punia's wife Indira Punia, Poonam Kishore, wife of Bahraich MP Kamal Kishore, who was included in Rajiv Gandhi's Commando Squad, and Snehalata Pal, wife of senior leader Jagdambika Pal, are holding discussions
 beete agast maah main mahila cameti kii netaaon ne pradesh main kanoon-vyavastha ke khilaaf pradesh kii rajdhani main ek bada pradarshan kiya tha, jisamen kai netaaon ko chotein ai thim
 Since then, the activities of the women's organization have slowed down a bit
 ek mahila netaa bataati hai ki chunaav jaise-jaise najadik aata jayega, mahila kaaryakartaaon se party netaaon kaa dhyaan hatataa jayega
 This is because these leaders have to show their presence in the elections
 udhar, rashtriya lokdal (ralod) kii pradesh mahila ikai main adhyaksh kaa pad beete teen varshon se khaali he
 In 2008, State President of Rashtriya Mahila Lok Dal, Shobha Patel resigned after accusing the party of neglect
 uske baad se kisi kii tainaati nahin ho pai he
 Despite having three state women general secretaries in the party, the work of the women's organization is sluggish
 pradesh ralod adhyaksh baba hardev bataate hai ki mahila sanghathan kaa nae sire se gathan kiya ja rahaa he
 Since the state-wide pit bust movement in 2008 against the inflation, the women's wing of RLD has not made any notable movement in the state
 agle vidhansabha chunaav main bhi uski ummidavaari shunya hi rahane vaali he
 This time too, the Indian Women's Federation associated with the CPI will not have the participation like the previous elections
 chaar saal pehle astitv main ai pis party ke bheetar abhi mahila sanghathan khadaa nahin ho paaya he
 However the party has entrusted this responsibility to General Secretary Parveen Ayub Idrisi
 apana dal kii pradesh adhyaksh krishna patel bhi bataati hai ki agle chunaav main mahila sanghathan se judi netaaon ko zyada jagah di jaaegi
 The Janwadi Party has decided to field the Janata Mahila Morcha office bearers in about one-fourth of the seats
 spasht he ki mahilaon ke mudde uthaane vaali partiyon ne apane bheetar mahila sanghathanon ko utani tavajjo nahin di
 The leaders of women's organizations have been used by parties as 'cosmetic faves'
 inkaa kaam reliyon or samarohon main mahaj bheed jutaney tak hi simit rah gaya he
 Sociologist and former Vice Chancellor of Lucknow University Prof
 ruparekha verma mahila sanghathanon kii niskriyata ko hi jimmedaar tehraati hai
 She says, "women's organizations cannot raise their voice only in parties, in which case these women's organizations should be commented on rather than political parties
 jab tak ye sanghathan party ke bheetar jujharupan nahin dikhaaenge unki baat ko baahar bhi koi tavajjo nahin degaa

 Without this, any kind of communication will be declared illegal

 He said that about 3 lakh doctors are on hunger strike as the government has not heard their complaints

 Twenty years later, after seeing the press from within the White House, he had lost some confidence in its importance

 This newspaper contacted the editorial board of all those who believe in liberal values and freedom of the press

 Journalists are not considered American citizens but are being projected as enemies of the people

 So we approached the editorial board of all the small and big liberal and conservative newspapers across the country to write editorials in their own words about these basic attacks
 " When there is any corrupt power in the country, its job is to replace the free press with government-run media
 aaj america main hamaare paas ek aise raashtrapati hai jinhone aisi soch taiyaar kar di he ki media kaa jo hissaa maujuuda prashasan kii nitiyon ko saport nahin karata he, vah janata kaa dushman he
 It is also one of the many lies spread by the President

 The press is indispensable for an independent society because it does not trust politicians blindly
 chaahe wo sthaneey yojana board ke sadsy hon yaa phir white house ke
 It is not a mere coincidence that the current president has a lot of strings attached in financial matters, due to which he has been appointed by his own Justice Department as an independent counsel to investigate him
 ab aise raashtrapati ne un patrakaron ko dhamkaane kii bahut koshish kii he jo swatantra rup se kai tathyon ko saamne laate hai

 This month, Ipsos conducted a survey in which 48 percent of Republicans believed that the news media was an enemy of the American public

 a quarter of Americans are now saying that the president should have the authority to shut down the ill-treated press
 is survey main shaamil 13 fisadi logon ne kaha he ki raashtrapati ko CNN, The Washington Post and The New York Times jaise samachar madhyamon ko band kar dena chahie
 This model, provoking its supporters, is describing how 21st-century dictators, Russia's Putin and Turkey's Erdogan, work

 Trump's supporters insist that his reference is only to media that is not neutral
 ve saare press ke bare main aisa nahin kehete hai
 But the President's own words and his record repeatedly show how dishonest this argument of supporters is
 america ke sansthaapakon ne is baat ko mahasoos kiya tha ki press tatasth nahin bhi ho saktaa he phir bhi unhone samvidhan main press or patrakaron kii swatantraaa ko sunishchit kiya tha
 Thomas Jefferson wrote that our freedom depends on the freedom of the press and there can be no limit

 They also ask their supporters to follow what they are saying
 pichley maheene consaas main unhone kaha tha ki bas hamaari suno, ye log (press) jo bakawaas dikhaate hai us par yakeen mat karo
 So remember that what you are watching or studying is not just happening
 jorge orwell ne apane upanyaas 1984 main kaha tha ki "jo party aapako yah kahe ki apni ankhon or kaanon ke dekhe-sune sabooton ko mat maano, yah unki taraf se sabase anivaary or antim farmaan he
 " George Orwell put it more gracefully in his novel “1984
 "" The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears
 It was their final, most essential command
 " aaj trump apane samarthakon ko yahi karne ke liye kehete hai
 In the first 558 days of his tenure, he has made 4,229 false claims
 washington post ne unke jhuthe daavon kii suchi banaai he
 Yet there are only 17 percent of Trump's supporters who believe that the US administration continues to lie

 The first is from the New York Times - 1787 main jab samvidhan kaa janm hua tha, us saal thomas jafarasan ne apane mitra ko likhaa tha ki agar mujh par iskaa faisalaa choda jaataa ki sarkaar ho magar akhbaar na ho, akhbaar ho lekin sarkaar na ho to main ek jatke main duusare vikalp ko chun letaa
 This was Jefferson's thinking before becoming president
 bees saal baad white house ke bheetar se press ko dekhne ke baad unke man main iske mahatv ko lekar bharosa kuch kam ho gaya tha
 "nothing can be believed in what is printed in the newspaper, the truth becomes doubtful by being put in this polluted vehicle
 " jaifarasan ke vichaar ab ye ho jate hai
 Jefferson's discomfort is understandable
 ek khule samaaj main news kii reporting kaa udhyam kai tarah ke hiton ke takaraav se jud jaataa he
 His uneasiness also reflects the need for the rights he added to the constitution
 apane anubhavon se samvidhan nirmaataaon ko laga tha ki sahi soochnaaon se las janata ko bhrashtachar mitaane or aage chalakar azaadi or nyaay ko protsaahit karne main madad milti he
 Public debate is a political duty
 1964 main supreme court ne kaha tha
 This debate should take place without any hesitation
 kai baar sarkaar or sarkari adhikariyon par jamkar hamale hone chahie, bhale hi wo kisi ko acha na lage
 In 2018, there have been attacks on the press on behalf of government officials
 kisi story ko kam dikhaane yaa zyaada dikhaane ko lekar news media kii aalochana thik he
 It is okay to criticize if something is printed wrong
 news reporter or sampadak bhi insaan hai
 They make mistakes
 unhen thik karnaa hamaare peshey kaa ahm hissaa he
 But to say the truth you don't like is fake news, it is dangerous for democracy
 patrakaron ko janata kaa dushman kahana bhi khataranaak he
 Small newspapers in America are going through an economic crisis
 desh bhar ke patrakaron kii raksha ke liye bane kanoon bhi kamazor hai
 In such a situation, these attacks on the press have become a challenge for him
 in sabake baad bhi in akhbaaron ke patrkaar sawaal poochne ke liye mehnat kiye ja rahe hai or aap tak un story ko pahunchaa rahe hai jinke bare main aapako pataa bhi nahin chalata
 The San Luis Obispo Tribune published a report about a prison inmate who was held in detention for 46 hours
 is report ne desh ko majaboor kar diya ki jail main maansik rup se biimaar kaidiyon ke ilaaj main badlaav laayaa jaae
 Last week, The Boston Globe proposed that their campaigns include small newspapers in towns to large metros
 The Times bhi isamen shaamil ho gaya taaki ham apane pathakon ko america ke azaad press ke mahatv ko yaad dilaa saken
 All these editors unite and underline the foundation of the American institution
 agar aapane in sampadakeey ko nahin padhaa he to pleez local akhabaaron ko sabsakrib karen, jab bhi ve acha kaam karen, unki tarif karen or agar lage ki isse bhi acha kar sakate hai to unki aalochana karen
 We are all together in this
 neuyork times kaa sampadakeey yahaan samaapt hota he
 Can big newspapers in India write such editorials in favor of small newspapers, do they include small newspapers in their campaign of press freedom? This New York Times editorial gives you a glimpse of how far behind we are in expressing democratic values
 isliye hindi ke patrkaar jinka jivan hindi ke akhabaaron main nishchit hi nasht hone vaala he, unhen ise padhanaa chahie
 Sometimes self-education saves itself from destruction
 akhbaar or patrakarita nasht ho jaaenge magar ek padhaa likhaa sachet patrkaar bachaa rahegaa
 If he survives, everything will be fine again
 ab aap america ke di bastal globe akhbaar kii site par jaaen
 Wrote about this campaign there
 is akhbaar ne un sabhi akhabaaron ke sampadakeey board se sampark saadhaa jo udaar mulyon or press kii azaadi main yakeen rakhte hai
 "the main focus of President Trump's politics is his constant attack on the free press
" patrakaron ko amareeki naagarik nahin mana jaataa he balki unhen logon ke dushman kii tarah pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 Continued attacks on the free press will have dangerous consequences
 isliye hamane desh bhar ke sabhi chote or bade udaaravaadi or rudhiwaadi akhbaaron ke sampadakeey board se sampark kiya ki ve in buniyadi hamalon ko lekar apane shabdon main sampadakeey likhen
 " jab desh main koi bhi bhrasht satta kaabiz hoti he tab uskaa kaam hota he ki azaad press kii jagah sarkaar sanchalit media ko le aae
 Today in America, we have a President who has prepared such a view that the part of the media that does not support the policies of the present administration is an enemy of the people
 raashtrapati dwaara failaae gaye kai jhooth main se ek jhooth yah bhi he
 “freedom of the press is mandatory for the protection of freedom
 " jon adam kaa yah sutara vaakya 200 saalon se zyaada amareeki siddhanton kaa hissaa rahaa he jisane patrakaron kii desh main raksha kii he
 Has been a model for the press in other countries of the world
 aaj is par gambhir khatara he
 From Beijing to Baghdad and Ankara to Moscow, dictators are constantly giving signals that journalists can be declared enemies of the public
 swatantrat samaaj ke liye press anivaary he kyonki yah netaaon par aankh band kar bharosa nahin karata he
 Whether he is a member of the Local Planning Board or the White House
 yah sirf sanyog nahin he ki maujuuda raashtrapati ke vittiya maamalon main kai jhol hai, jinke sandigdh vyaavhaaron ke chalate unheen ke justise department ne unki jaanch ke liye ek swatantra vakil kii niyukti kii he
 Now such a president has tried very hard to threaten those journalists who independently reveal many facts
 america main sabake bich ek sthapit or nishpaksh sahmati rahi he ki press kii bhoomika mahatvapurn he
 Even after this, there are many Americans who do not follow this opinion
 is maheene Ipsos ne ek survey kiya tha jisamen 48 fisadi republic samarthakon ne mana he ki news media amareeki janata kaa dushman he
 In another survey, 51 percent of Republicans compared the press to the enemy of the public
 loktantr kaa ahm hissaa nahin mana he
 Trump's attack explains why his supporters support this undemocratic attitude
 ek chauthai amareeki ab kehane lage hai ki raashtrapati ke paas karaab bartaav karne vaale press ko band karne kaa adhikaar hona chahie
 13 percent of the people in this survey have said that the President should discontinue news media such as CNN, The Washington Post and The New York Times
 apane samarthakon ko uksaane vaala yah model bataa rahaa he ki 21veen sadi ke taanashaah rus ke putin or turki ke erdogan kaise kaam karte hai
 You do not need to officially declare Centurieship to stop the information
 trump ke samarthak is baat par jor dete hai ki unka ishaara sirf us media kii taraf he jo tatasth nahin he
 They do not say this about the entire press
 lekin raashtrapati ke apane hi shabd or unka record baar-baar yahi bataata he ki samarthakon ke is tark main kitni beyimaani he
 The founders of America realized that the press could not be neutral, yet they ensured the freedom of the press and journalists in the constitution
 thomas jeffrasan ne likhaa tha ki hamaari swatantraaa press kii swatantraaa par nirbhar karti he or uski koi seemaa nahin tay kii ja sakati he
 From the founders of the constitution to the leaders of all parties, there have been complaints from the media
 media par aarope lagaate rahe hai lekin ek santhaan ke rup main press kaa hameshaa sammaan kiya gaya he
 It is not long before Republican President Ronald Regan said that our tradition of free press has been and will remain an integral and important part of our democracy
 1971 main supreme court ke justise hugo blike ne likhaa tha ki press kaa kaam shasit kii seva karnaa he na ki shaasha kaa
 Today Trump takes with him the same media that advocates his leadership
 sawaal nahin karata he
 If seen, only the President is not dividing the people for his political and personal benefits
 ve apane samarthakon se bhi kehete hai ki wo jo kah rahe hai usee kaa anukaran karen
 Last month in Kansas, he said that just listen to us, don't believe the rubbish these people (press) show
 itnaa yaad rakhana ki jo aap dekh rahe hai yaa pard rahe hai vahi sirf nahin ho rahaa he
 George Orwell stated in his novel 1984 that "the party who tells you not to listen to the evidence seen in your eyes and ears is the most mandatory and final decree from his side"
 " George Orwell put it more gracefully in his novel "1984
 ” “the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears
 It was their final, most essential command
 ” Today, Trump asks his supporters to do the same
 apane kaarykaal ke pehle 558 dinon main unhone 4,229 galat daawey kiye hai
 The Washington Post lists his false claims
 phir bhi trump ke samarthakon main maatr 17 fisadi aise hai jo maanate hai ki amareeki prashasan lagaataar jhooth bolta rahata he
 His lie is becoming a fact
 soochnaaon se las nagarikon ke liye jhooth unke vajood ko nakaarta he
 The greatness of America depends on the fact that the free press is openly exposed to the truth
 press par janata kaa dushman kaa label chipkaana amareeki panrapara nahin he
 This decree is a threat to the common sense of citizenship that we have developed for two hundred years
 di boston globe kaa sampadakeey yahaan samaapt hota he
 The comments note- acha hota ki koi sabhi teen sau sampadakeey kaa anuwaad pesh karata kyonki har sampadakeey main alag anubhav or tathy hai
 This enhances our understanding of the freedom of the press
 hindi ke pathakon or patrakaron ke liye maine apni chuttee ke teen chaar ghante lagaakar yahaan anuwaad kiye hai

 Yet there are only 17 percent of Trump's supporters who believe that the US administration continues to lie
 unka jhooth hi tathy banataa ja rahaa he

 america kii mahanata is par nirbhar he ki mukt press satta ke saamne khulkar satya kaa bayaan kare
 It is not American tradition to stick the public's enemy label on the press

 Jefferson's discomfort is understandable
 ek khule samaaj main news kii reporting kaa udhyam kai tarah ke hiton ke takaraav se jud jaataa he
 His uneasiness also reflects the need for the rights he added to the constitution
 apane anubhavon se samvidhan nirmaataaon ko laga tha ki sahi soochnaaon se las janata ko bhrashtachar mitaane or aage chalakar azaadi or nyaay ko protsaahit karne main madad milti he
 Public debate is a political duty
 1964 main supreme court ne kaha tha
 This debate should take place without any hesitation
 kai baar sarkaar or sarkari adhikariyon par jamkar hamale hone chahie, bhale hi wo kisi ko acha na lage
 In 2018, there have been attacks on the press on behalf of government officials
 kisi story ko kam dikhaane yaa zyaada dikhaane ko lekar news media kii aalochana thik he
 It is okay to criticize if something is printed wrong
 news reporter or sampadak bhi insaan hai
 They make mistakes
 unhen thik karnaa hamaare peshey kaa ahm hissaa he
 But to say the truth you don't like is fake news, it is dangerous for democracy
 patrakaron ko janata kaa dushman kahana bhi khataranaak he
 Small newspapers in America are going through an economic crisis
 desh bhar ke patrakaron kii raksha ke liye bane kanoon bhi kamazor hai
 In such a situation, these attacks on the press have become a challenge for him
 in sabake baad bhi in akhbaaron ke patrkaar sawaal poochne ke liye mehnat kiye ja rahe hai or aap tak un story ko pahunchaa rahe hai jinke bare main aapako pataa bhi nahin chalata
 The San Luis Obispo Tribune published a report about a prison inmate who was held in detention for 46 hours
 is report ne desh ko majaboor kar diya ki jail main maansik rup se biimaar kaidiyon ke ilaaj main badlaav laayaa jaae
 Last week, The Boston Globe proposed that their campaigns include small newspapers in towns to large metros
 The Times bhi isamen shaamil ho gaya taaki ham apane pathakon ko america ke azaad press ke mahatv ko yaad dilaa saken
 All these editors unite and underline the foundation of the American institution
 agar aapane in sampadakeey ko nahin padhaa he to pleez local akhabaaron ko sabsakrib karen, jab bhi ve acha kaam karen, unki tarif karen or agar lage ki isse bhi acha kar sakate hai to unki aalochana karen
 We are all together in this
 neuyork times kaa sampadakeey yahaan samaapt hota he
 Can big newspapers in India write such editorials in favor of small newspapers, do they include small newspapers in their campaign of press freedom? This New York Times editorial gives you a glimpse of how far behind we are in expressing democratic values
 isliye hindi ke patrkaar jinka jivan hindi ke akhabaaron main nishchit hi nasht hone vaala he, unhen ise padhanaa chahie
 Sometimes self-education saves itself from destruction
 akhbaar or patrakarita nasht ho jaaenge magar ek padhaa likhaa sachet patrkaar bachaa rahegaa
 If he survives, everything will be fine again
 ab aap america ke di bastal globe akhbaar kii site par jaaen
 Wrote about this campaign there
 is akhbaar ne un sabhi akhabaaron ke sampadakeey board se sampark saadhaa jo udaar mulyon or press kii azaadi main yakeen rakhte hai
 "the main focus of President Trump's politics is his constant attack on the free press
" patrakaron ko amareeki naagarik nahin mana jaataa he balki unhen logon ke dushman kii tarah pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 Continued attacks on the free press will have dangerous consequences
 isliye hamane desh bhar ke sabhi chote or bade udaaravaadi or rudhiwaadi akhbaaron ke sampadakeey board se sampark kiya ki ve in buniyadi hamalon ko lekar apane shabdon main sampadakeey likhen
 " jab desh main koi bhi bhrasht satta kaabiz hoti he tab uskaa kaam hota he ki azaad press kii jagah sarkaar sanchalit media ko le aae
 Today in America, we have a President who has prepared such a view that the part of the media that does not support the policies of the present administration is an enemy of the people
 raashtrapati dwaara failaae gaye kai jhooth main se ek jhooth yah bhi he
 “freedom of the press is mandatory for the protection of freedom
 " jon adam kaa yah sutara vaakya 200 saalon se zyaada amareeki siddhanton kaa hissaa rahaa he jisane patrakaron kii desh main raksha kii he
 Has been a model for the press in other countries of the world
 aaj is par gambhir khatara he
 From Beijing to Baghdad and Ankara to Moscow, dictators are constantly giving signals that journalists can be declared enemies of the public
 swatantrat samaaj ke liye press anivaary he kyonki yah netaaon par aankh band kar bharosa nahin karata he
 Whether he is a member of the Local Planning Board or the White House
 yah sirf sanyog nahin he ki maujuuda raashtrapati ke vittiya maamalon main kai jhol hai, jinke sandigdh vyaavhaaron ke chalate unheen ke justise department ne unki jaanch ke liye ek swatantra vakil kii niyukti kii he
 Now such a president has tried very hard to threaten those journalists who independently reveal many facts
 america main sabake bich ek sthapit or nishpaksh sahmati rahi he ki press kii bhoomika mahatvapurn he
 Even after this, there are many Americans who do not follow this opinion
 is maheene Ipsos ne ek survey kiya tha jisamen 48 fisadi republic samarthakon ne mana he ki news media amareeki janata kaa dushman he
 In another survey, 51 percent of Republicans compared the press to the enemy of the public
 loktantr kaa ahm hissaa nahin mana he
 Trump's attack explains why his supporters support this undemocratic attitude
 ek chauthai amareeki ab kehane lage hai ki raashtrapati ke paas karaab bartaav karne vaale press ko band karne kaa adhikaar hona chahie
 13 percent of the people in this survey have said that the President should discontinue news media such as CNN, The Washington Post and The New York Times
 apane samarthakon ko uksaane vaala yah model bataa rahaa he ki 21veen sadi ke taanashaah rus ke putin or turki ke erdogan kaise kaam karte hai
 You do not need to officially declare Centurieship to stop the information
 trump ke samarthak is baat par jor dete hai ki unka ishaara sirf us media kii taraf he jo tatasth nahin he
 They do not say this about the entire press
 lekin raashtrapati ke apane hi shabd or unka record baar-baar yahi bataata he ki samarthakon ke is tark main kitni beyimaani he
 The founders of America realized that the press could not be neutral, yet they ensured the freedom of the press and journalists in the constitution
 thomas jeffrasan ne likhaa tha ki hamaari swatantraaa press kii swatantraaa par nirbhar karti he or uski koi seemaa nahin tay kii ja sakati he
 From the founders of the constitution to the leaders of all parties, there have been complaints from the media
 media par aarope lagaate rahe hai lekin ek santhaan ke rup main press kaa hameshaa sammaan kiya gaya he
 It is not long before Republican President Ronald Regan said that our tradition of free press has been and will remain an integral and important part of our democracy
 1971 main supreme court ke justise hugo blike ne likhaa tha ki press kaa kaam shasit kii seva karnaa he na ki shaasha kaa
 Today Trump takes with him the same media that advocates his leadership
 sawaal nahin karata he
 If seen, only the President is not dividing the people for his political and personal benefits
 ve apane samarthakon se bhi kehete hai ki wo jo kah rahe hai usee kaa anukaran karen
 Last month in Kansas, he said that just listen to us, don't believe the rubbish these people (press) show
 itnaa yaad rakhana ki jo aap dekh rahe hai yaa pard rahe hai vahi sirf nahin ho rahaa he
 George Orwell stated in his novel 1984 that "the party who tells you not to listen to the evidence seen in your eyes and ears is the most mandatory and final decree from his side"
 " George Orwell put it more gracefully in his novel "1984
 ” “the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears
 It was their final, most essential command
 ” Today, Trump asks his supporters to do the same
 apane kaarykaal ke pehle 558 dinon main unhone 4,229 galat daawey kiye hai
 The Washington Post lists his false claims
 phir bhi trump ke samarthakon main maatr 17 fisadi aise hai jo maanate hai ki amareeki prashasan lagaataar jhooth bolta rahata he
 His lie is becoming a fact
 soochnaaon se las nagarikon ke liye jhooth unke vajood ko nakaarta he
 The greatness of America depends on the fact that the free press is openly exposed to the truth
 press par janata kaa dushman kaa label chipkaana amareeki panrapara nahin he
 This decree is a threat to the common sense of citizenship that we have developed for two hundred years
 di boston globe kaa sampadakeey yahaan samaapt hota he
 The comments note- acha hota ki koi sabhi teen sau sampadakeey kaa anuwaad pesh karata kyonki har sampadakeey main alag anubhav or tathy hai
 This enhances our understanding of the freedom of the press
 hindi ke pathakon or patrakaron ke liye maine apni chuttee ke teen chaar ghante lagaakar yahaan anuwaad kiye hai
 It is also written so that you know that such work takes hard work
 vakt lagata he
 Everything does not come in focus
 agar aap chaahate hai ki samaaj behatar ho, to apane hisse kaa shramdan kiijie
 i will translate some more editorials in the coming days

 saarvajanik bahes raajnneetik kartavya he
 The Supreme Court said in 1964
 yah bahes bina kisi jhijak ke khule man se honi chahie
 Many times the government and government officials should be attacked fiercely, even if they do not like anyone
 2018 main sarkari adhikariyon kii taraf se hi press ko lekar kshati pahunchane vaale hamale hue hai
 It is okay to criticize the news media for showing less or more of a story
 kuch galat chapa ho to uski aalochana thik he
 News reporters and editors are also human
 unase galatiyaan hoti hai
 Fixing them is an important part of our profession
 lekin aapako jo satya pasand nahin he use phek news kahana loktantr ke liye khataranaak he
 It is also dangerous to call journalists enemies of the public
 america main chote akhbaar aarthik sankat se guzar rahe hai
 Laws to protect journalists around the country are also weak
 aise main press par hone vaale ye hamale unke liye chunauti ban gaye hai
 Even after all this, journalists of these newspapers are working hard to ask questions and are sending you stories about which you do not even know
 The San Luis Obispo Tribune ne jail main band ek kaidi ke bare main report chhaapi thi jise 46 ghante tak roak kar rakhaa gaya tha
 This report forced the country to change the treatment of mentally ill prisoners in jail
 pichley hafte The Boston Globe kaa prastaav aayaa tha ki unke is abhiyaan main kasbon ke chote akhbaaron se lekar mahanagaron ke bade akhbaar shaamil ho rahe hai
 The Times also joined it so that we can remind our readers of the importance of the free press of America
 ye sabhi sampadakeey ekajute hokar amareeki santhaan ke buniyaad ko rekhaankit kar rahe hai
 If you have not read these editorials, please subscribe to the local newspapers, whenever they do good work, praise them and criticize them if you think you can do even better
 ham sab isamen saath hai
 The New York Times editorial ends here
 kya bharat ke bade akhbaar chote akhbaaron ke haq main aise sampadakeey likh sakate hai, kya ve press kii azaadi ke apane abhiyaan main chote akhbaaron ko shaamil karte hai? neuyark times ke is sampadakeey se aapako jhalak milti he ki ham loktantric mulyon ko abhivyakt karne main kitna peeche hai
 Therefore, Hindi journalists whose life is going to be destroyed in Hindi newspapers, they should read it
 kai baar swadhyay hi nasht hone se bachaa letaa he
 Newspaper and journalism will be destroyed, but a well-educated conscious journalist will remain
 wo batch jayega to phir kabhi sab thik bhi ho jayega
 Now go to the site of The Bastal Globe newspaper of USA
 vahaan is abhiyaan ke bare main likhaa he
 This newspaper contacted the editorial board of all those who believe in liberal values and freedom of the press
 "raashtrapati trump kii raajnneeti ke mukhya centre main he azaad press par lagaataar hamalaa karte rahanaa
 Journalists are not considered American citizens but are being projected as enemies of the people
 azaad press par hone vaale nirantar hamalon ke khataranaak parinaam honge
 So we approached the editorial board of all the small and big liberal and conservative newspapers across the country to write editorials in their own words about these basic attacks
 " When there is any corrupt power in the country, its job is to replace the free press with government-run media
 aaj america main hamaare paas ek aise raashtrapati hai jinhone aisi soch taiyaar kar di he ki media kaa jo hissaa maujuuda prashasan kii nitiyon ko saport nahin karata he, vah janata kaa dushman he
 It is also one of the many lies spread by the President
 "swatantraaa kii suraksha ke liye press kii swatantraaa anivaary he
 "this formula of John Adam has been part of American principles for over 200 years that have protected journalists in the country
 duniya ke anya deshon main press ke liye model kaa kaam karata rahaa he
 Today it is in serious danger
 beijing se baghdad or ankara se lekar moscow tak ke taanaashaahon kii taraf se ye signal lagaataar diya ja rahaa he ki patrakaron ko janata kaa dushman ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he
 The press is indispensable for an independent society because it does not trust politicians blindly
 chaahe wo sthaneey yojana board ke sadsy hon yaa phir white house ke
 It is not a mere coincidence that the current president has a lot of strings attached in financial matters, due to which he has been appointed by his own Justice Department as an independent counsel to investigate him
 ab aise raashtrapati ne un patrakaron ko dhamkaane kii bahut koshish kii he jo swatantra rup se kai tathyon ko saamne laate hai
 There has been an established and unbiased consensus among all in America that the role of the press is important
 iske baad bhi ab aise bahut se american hai jo is mat ko nahin maanate hai
 This month, Ipsos conducted a survey in which 48 percent of Republicans believed that the news media was an enemy of the American public
 ek or survey main 51 fisadi republican ne press kii tulana janata ke dushman se kii he
 Is not considered an important part of democracy
 trump ke hamale se pataa chalata he ki kyon unke samarthak is aloktantric ravaiye kaa samarthan karte hai
 a quarter of Americans are now saying that the president should have the authority to shut down the ill-treated press
 is survey main shaamil 13 fisadi logon ne kaha he ki raashtrapati ko CNN, The Washington Post and The New York Times jaise samachar madhyamon ko band kar dena chahie
 This model, provoking its supporters, is describing how 21st-century dictators, Russia's Putin and Turkey's Erdogan, work
 aapako soochnaaon ko rokane ke liye aadhikarik rup se sensharship ke elaan kii zarurat hi nahin he
 Trump's supporters insist that his reference is only to media that is not neutral
 ve saare press ke bare main aisa nahin kehete hai
 But the President's own words and his record repeatedly show how dishonest this argument of supporters is
 america ke sansthaapakon ne is baat ko mahasoos kiya tha ki press tatasth nahin bhi ho saktaa he phir bhi unhone samvidhan main press or patrakaron kii swatantraaa ko sunishchit kiya tha
 Thomas Jefferson wrote that our freedom depends on the freedom of the press and there can be no limit
 samvidhan ke sansthaapakon se lekar sabhi dalon ke netaaon ko media se shikaayatein rahi hai
 The media has been accused but the press has always been respected as an institution
 bahut lambey samay kii baat nahin he jab republican raashtrapati ronald regan ne kaha tha ki mukt press kii hamaari parampara hamaare loktantr kaa abhinn or mahatvapurn ang rahaa he or rahegaa
 In 1971, Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black wrote that the job of the press is to serve the governed and not the ruler
 aaj trump apane saath usee media ko lekar le jate hai jo unke netritv kii vakaalat karata he
 Does not question
 dekha jaae to sirf raashtrapati hi apane raajnneetik or nijee phaayde ke liye logon main vibhaajan nahin kar rahe hai
 They also ask their supporters to follow what they are saying
 pichley maheene consaas main unhone kaha tha ki bas hamaari suno, ye log (press) jo bakawaas dikhaate hai us par yakeen mat karo
 So remember that what you are watching or studying is not just happening

 america main chote akhbaar aarthik sankat se guzar rahe hai
 Laws to protect journalists around the country are also weak
 aise main press par hone vaale ye hamale unke liye chunauti ban gaye hai
 Even after all this, journalists of these newspapers are working hard to ask questions and are sending you stories about which you do not even know
 The San Luis Obispo Tribune ne jail main band ek kaidi ke bare main report chhaapi thi jise 46 ghante tak roak kar rakhaa gaya tha
 This report forced the country to change the treatment of mentally ill prisoners in jail
 pichley hafte The Boston Globe kaa prastaav aayaa tha ki unke is abhiyaan main kasbon ke chote akhbaaron se lekar mahanagaron ke bade akhbaar shaamil ho rahe hai
 The Times also joined it so that we can remind our readers of the importance of the free press of America
 ye sabhi sampadakeey ekajute hokar amareeki santhaan ke buniyaad ko rekhaankit kar rahe hai
 If you have not read these editorials, please subscribe to the local newspapers, whenever they do good work, praise them and criticize them if you think you can do even better

 The New York Times editorial ends here
 kya bharat ke bade akhbaar chote akhbaaron ke haq main aise sampadakeey likh sakate hai, kya ve press kii azaadi ke apane abhiyaan main chote akhbaaron ko shaamil karte hai? neuyark times ke is sampadakeey se aapako jhalak milti he ki ham loktantric mulyon ko abhivyakt karne main kitna peeche hai
 Therefore, Hindi journalists whose life is going to be destroyed in Hindi newspapers, they should read it
 kai baar swadhyay hi nasht hone se bachaa letaa he
 Newspaper and journalism will be destroyed, but a well-educated conscious journalist will remain
 wo batch jayega to phir kabhi sab thik bhi ho jayega
 Now go to the site of The Bastal Globe newspaper of USA
 vahaan is abhiyaan ke bare main likhaa he
 This newspaper contacted the editorial board of all those who believe in liberal values and freedom of the press
 "raashtrapati trump kii raajnneeti ke mukhya centre main he azaad press par lagaataar hamalaa karte rahanaa
 Journalists are not considered American citizens but are being projected as enemies of the people
 azaad press par hone vaale nirantar hamalon ke khataranaak parinaam honge
 So we approached the editorial board of all the small and big liberal and conservative newspapers across the country to write editorials in their own words about these basic attacks
 " When there is any corrupt power in the country, its job is to replace the free press with government-run media
 aaj america main hamaare paas ek aise raashtrapati hai jinhone aisi soch taiyaar kar di he ki media kaa jo hissaa maujuuda prashasan kii nitiyon ko saport nahin karata he, vah janata kaa dushman he
 It is also one of the many lies spread by the President
 "swatantraaa kii suraksha ke liye press kii swatantraaa anivaary he
 "this formula of John Adam has been part of American principles for over 200 years that have protected journalists in the country
 duniya ke anya deshon main press ke liye model kaa kaam karata rahaa he
 Today it is in serious danger
 beijing se baghdad or ankara se lekar moscow tak ke taanaashaahon kii taraf se ye signal lagaataar diya ja rahaa he ki patrakaron ko janata kaa dushman ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he
 The press is indispensable for an independent society because it does not trust politicians blindly
 chaahe wo sthaneey yojana board ke sadsy hon yaa phir white house ke
 It is not a mere coincidence that the current president has a lot of strings attached in financial matters, due to which he has been appointed by his own Justice Department as an independent counsel to investigate him
 ab aise raashtrapati ne un patrakaron ko dhamkaane kii bahut koshish kii he jo swatantra rup se kai tathyon ko saamne laate hai
 There has been an established and unbiased consensus among all in America that the role of the press is important
 iske baad bhi ab aise bahut se american hai jo is mat ko nahin maanate hai
 This month, Ipsos conducted a survey in which 48 percent of Republicans believed that the news media was an enemy of the American public
 ek or survey main 51 fisadi republican ne press kii tulana janata ke dushman se kii he
 Is not considered an important part of democracy
 trump ke hamale se pataa chalata he ki kyon unke samarthak is aloktantric ravaiye kaa samarthan karte hai
 a quarter of Americans are now saying that the president should have the authority to shut down the ill-treated press
 is survey main shaamil 13 fisadi logon ne kaha he ki raashtrapati ko CNN, The Washington Post and The New York Times jaise samachar madhyamon ko band kar dena chahie
 This model, provoking its supporters, is describing how 21st-century dictators, Russia's Putin and Turkey's Erdogan, work
 aapako soochnaaon ko rokane ke liye aadhikarik rup se sensharship ke elaan kii zarurat hi nahin he
 Trump's supporters insist that his reference is only to media that is not neutral
 ve saare press ke bare main aisa nahin kehete hai
 But the President's own words and his record repeatedly show how dishonest this argument of supporters is
 america ke sansthaapakon ne is baat ko mahasoos kiya tha ki press tatasth nahin bhi ho saktaa he phir bhi unhone samvidhan main press or patrakaron kii swatantraaa ko sunishchit kiya tha
 Thomas Jefferson wrote that our freedom depends on the freedom of the press and there can be no limit
 samvidhan ke sansthaapakon se lekar sabhi dalon ke netaaon ko media se shikaayatein rahi hai
 The media has been accused but the press has always been respected as an institution
 bahut lambey samay kii baat nahin he jab republican raashtrapati ronald regan ne kaha tha ki mukt press kii hamaari parampara hamaare loktantr kaa abhinn or mahatvapurn ang rahaa he or rahegaa
 In 1971, Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black wrote that the job of the press is to serve the governed and not the ruler
 aaj trump apane saath usee media ko lekar le jate hai jo unke netritv kii vakaalat karata he
 Does not question
 dekha jaae to sirf raashtrapati hi apane raajnneetik or nijee phaayde ke liye logon main vibhaajan nahin kar rahe hai
 They also ask their supporters to follow what they are saying
 pichley maheene consaas main unhone kaha tha ki bas hamaari suno, ye log (press) jo bakawaas dikhaate hai us par yakeen mat karo
 So remember that what you are watching or studying is not just happening
 jorge orwell ne apane upanyaas 1984 main kaha tha ki "jo party aapako yah kahe ki apni ankhon or kaanon ke dekhe-sune sabooton ko mat maano, yah unki taraf se sabase anivaary or antim farmaan he

 "" The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears

 In the first 558 days of his tenure, he has made 4,229 false claims
 washington post ne unke jhuthe daavon kii suchi banaai he
 Yet there are only 17 percent of Trump's supporters who believe that the US administration continues to lie
 unka jhooth hi tathy banataa ja rahaa he
 For citizens equipped with information, lies deny their existence
 america kii mahanata is par nirbhar he ki mukt press satta ke saamne khulkar satya kaa bayaan kare

 The San Luis Obispo Tribune published a report about a prison inmate who was held in detention for 46 hours
 is report ne desh ko majaboor kar diya ki jail main maansik rup se biimaar kaidiyon ke ilaaj main badlaav laayaa jaae
 Last week, The Boston Globe proposed that their campaigns include small newspapers in towns to large metros
 The Times bhi isamen shaamil ho gaya taaki ham apane pathakon ko america ke azaad press ke mahatv ko yaad dilaa saken
 All these editors unite and underline the foundation of the American institution
 agar aapane in sampadakeey ko nahin padhaa he to pleez local akhabaaron ko sabsakrib karen, jab bhi ve acha kaam karen, unki tarif karen or agar lage ki isse bhi acha kar sakate hai to unki aalochana karen
 We are all together in this
 neuyork times kaa sampadakeey yahaan samaapt hota he
 Can big newspapers in India write such editorials in favor of small newspapers, do they include small newspapers in their campaign of press freedom? This New York Times editorial gives you a glimpse of how far behind we are in expressing democratic values
 isliye hindi ke patrkaar jinka jivan hindi ke akhabaaron main nishchit hi nasht hone vaala he, unhen ise padhanaa chahie
 Sometimes self-education saves itself from destruction
 akhbaar or patrakarita nasht ho jaaenge magar ek padhaa likhaa sachet patrkaar bachaa rahegaa
 If he survives, everything will be fine again
 ab aap america ke di bastal globe akhbaar kii site par jaaen
 Wrote about this campaign there
 is akhbaar ne un sabhi akhabaaron ke sampadakeey board se sampark saadhaa jo udaar mulyon or press kii azaadi main yakeen rakhte hai
 "the main focus of President Trump's politics is his constant attack on the free press
" patrakaron ko amareeki naagarik nahin mana jaataa he balki unhen logon ke dushman kii tarah pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 Continued attacks on the free press will have dangerous consequences
 isliye hamane desh bhar ke sabhi chote or bade udaaravaadi or rudhiwaadi akhbaaron ke sampadakeey board se sampark kiya ki ve in buniyadi hamalon ko lekar apane shabdon main sampadakeey likhen
 " jab desh main koi bhi bhrasht satta kaabiz hoti he tab uskaa kaam hota he ki azaad press kii jagah sarkaar sanchalit media ko le aae
 Today in America, we have a President who has prepared such a view that the part of the media that does not support the policies of the present administration is an enemy of the people
 raashtrapati dwaara failaae gaye kai jhooth main se ek jhooth yah bhi he
 “freedom of the press is mandatory for the protection of freedom
 " jon adam kaa yah sutara vaakya 200 saalon se zyaada amareeki siddhanton kaa hissaa rahaa he jisane patrakaron kii desh main raksha kii he
 Has been a model for the press in other countries of the world
 aaj is par gambhir khatara he
 From Beijing to Baghdad and Ankara to Moscow, dictators are constantly giving signals that journalists can be declared enemies of the public
 swatantrat samaaj ke liye press anivaary he kyonki yah netaaon par aankh band kar bharosa nahin karata he
 Whether he is a member of the Local Planning Board or the White House
 yah sirf sanyog nahin he ki maujuuda raashtrapati ke vittiya maamalon main kai jhol hai, jinke sandigdh vyaavhaaron ke chalate unheen ke justise department ne unki jaanch ke liye ek swatantra vakil kii niyukti kii he
 Now such a president has tried very hard to threaten those journalists who independently reveal many facts
 america main sabake bich ek sthapit or nishpaksh sahmati rahi he ki press kii bhoomika mahatvapurn he
 Even after this, there are many Americans who do not follow this opinion
 is maheene Ipsos ne ek survey kiya tha jisamen 48 fisadi republic samarthakon ne mana he ki news media amareeki janata kaa dushman he
 In another survey, 51 percent of Republicans compared the press to the enemy of the public
 loktantr kaa ahm hissaa nahin mana he
 Trump's attack explains why his supporters support this undemocratic attitude
 ek chauthai amareeki ab kehane lage hai ki raashtrapati ke paas karaab bartaav karne vaale press ko band karne kaa adhikaar hona chahie
 13 percent of the people in this survey have said that the President should discontinue news media such as CNN, The Washington Post and The New York Times
 apane samarthakon ko uksaane vaala yah model bataa rahaa he ki 21veen sadi ke taanashaah rus ke putin or turki ke erdogan kaise kaam karte hai
 You do not need to officially declare Centurieship to stop the information
 trump ke samarthak is baat par jor dete hai ki unka ishaara sirf us media kii taraf he jo tatasth nahin he
 They do not say this about the entire press
 lekin raashtrapati ke apane hi shabd or unka record baar-baar yahi bataata he ki samarthakon ke is tark main kitni beyimaani he
 The founders of America realized that the press could not be neutral, yet they ensured the freedom of the press and journalists in the constitution
 thomas jeffrasan ne likhaa tha ki hamaari swatantraaa press kii swatantraaa par nirbhar karti he or uski koi seemaa nahin tay kii ja sakati he
 From the founders of the constitution to the leaders of all parties, there have been complaints from the media
 media par aarope lagaate rahe hai lekin ek santhaan ke rup main press kaa hameshaa sammaan kiya gaya he
 It is not long before Republican President Ronald Regan said that our tradition of free press has been and will remain an integral and important part of our democracy
 1971 main supreme court ke justise hugo blike ne likhaa tha ki press kaa kaam shasit kii seva karnaa he na ki shaasha kaa
 Today Trump takes with him the same media that advocates his leadership
 sawaal nahin karata he
 If seen, only the President is not dividing the people for his political and personal benefits
 ve apane samarthakon se bhi kehete hai ki wo jo kah rahe hai usee kaa anukaran karen
 Last month in Kansas, he said that just listen to us, don't believe the rubbish these people (press) show
 itnaa yaad rakhana ki jo aap dekh rahe hai yaa pard rahe hai vahi sirf nahin ho rahaa he
 George Orwell stated in his novel 1984 that "the party who tells you not to listen to the evidence seen in your eyes and ears is the most mandatory and final decree from his side"
 " George Orwell put it more gracefully in his novel "1984
 ” “the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears
 It was their final, most essential command
 ” Today, Trump asks his supporters to do the same
 apane kaarykaal ke pehle 558 dinon main unhone 4,229 galat daawey kiye hai
 The Washington Post lists his false claims
 phir bhi trump ke samarthakon main maatr 17 fisadi aise hai jo maanate hai ki amareeki prashasan lagaataar jhooth bolta rahata he
 His lie is becoming a fact
 soochnaaon se las nagarikon ke liye jhooth unke vajood ko nakaarta he
 The greatness of America depends on the fact that the free press is openly exposed to the truth
 press par janata kaa dushman kaa label chipkaana amareeki panrapara nahin he
 This decree is a threat to the common sense of citizenship that we have developed for two hundred years
 di boston globe kaa sampadakeey yahaan samaapt hota he
 The comments note- acha hota ki koi sabhi teen sau sampadakeey kaa anuwaad pesh karata kyonki har sampadakeey main alag anubhav or tathy hai

 kya bharat ke bade akhbaar chote akhbaaron ke haq main aise sampadakeey likh sakate hai, kya ve press kii azaadi ke apane abhiyaan main chote akhbaaron ko shaamil karte hai? neuyark times ke is sampadakeey se aapako jhalak milti he ki ham loktantric mulyon ko abhivyakt karne main kitna peeche hai
 Therefore, Hindi journalists whose life is going to be destroyed in Hindi newspapers, they should read it
 kai baar swadhyay hi nasht hone se bachaa letaa he
 Newspaper and journalism will be destroyed, but a well-educated conscious journalist will remain
 wo batch jayega to phir kabhi sab thik bhi ho jayega
 Now go to the site of The Bastal Globe newspaper of USA
 vahaan is abhiyaan ke bare main likhaa he
 This newspaper contacted the editorial board of all those who believe in liberal values and freedom of the press
 "raashtrapati trump kii raajnneeti ke mukhya centre main he azaad press par lagaataar hamalaa karte rahanaa
 Journalists are not considered American citizens but are being projected as enemies of the people
 azaad press par hone vaale nirantar hamalon ke khataranaak parinaam honge
 So we approached the editorial board of all the small and big liberal and conservative newspapers across the country to write editorials in their own words about these basic attacks
 " When there is any corrupt power in the country, its job is to replace the free press with government-run media
 aaj america main hamaare paas ek aise raashtrapati hai jinhone aisi soch taiyaar kar di he ki media kaa jo hissaa maujuuda prashasan kii nitiyon ko saport nahin karata he, vah janata kaa dushman he
 It is also one of the many lies spread by the President
 "swatantraaa kii suraksha ke liye press kii swatantraaa anivaary he
 "this formula of John Adam has been part of American principles for over 200 years that have protected journalists in the country
 duniya ke anya deshon main press ke liye model kaa kaam karata rahaa he
 Today it is in serious danger
 beijing se baghdad or ankara se lekar moscow tak ke taanaashaahon kii taraf se ye signal lagaataar diya ja rahaa he ki patrakaron ko janata kaa dushman ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he
 The press is indispensable for an independent society because it does not trust politicians blindly
 chaahe wo sthaneey yojana board ke sadsy hon yaa phir white house ke
 It is not a mere coincidence that the current president has a lot of strings attached in financial matters, due to which he has been appointed by his own Justice Department as an independent counsel to investigate him
 ab aise raashtrapati ne un patrakaron ko dhamkaane kii bahut koshish kii he jo swatantra rup se kai tathyon ko saamne laate hai
 There has been an established and unbiased consensus among all in America that the role of the press is important
 iske baad bhi ab aise bahut se american hai jo is mat ko nahin maanate hai
 This month, Ipsos conducted a survey in which 48 percent of Republicans believed that the news media was an enemy of the American public
 ek or survey main 51 fisadi republican ne press kii tulana janata ke dushman se kii he
 Is not considered an important part of democracy
 trump ke hamale se pataa chalata he ki kyon unke samarthak is aloktantric ravaiye kaa samarthan karte hai
 a quarter of Americans are now saying that the president should have the authority to shut down the ill-treated press
 is survey main shaamil 13 fisadi logon ne kaha he ki raashtrapati ko CNN, The Washington Post and The New York Times jaise samachar madhyamon ko band kar dena chahie
 This model, provoking its supporters, is describing how 21st-century dictators, Russia's Putin and Turkey's Erdogan, work
 aapako soochnaaon ko rokane ke liye aadhikarik rup se sensharship ke elaan kii zarurat hi nahin he
 Trump's supporters insist that his reference is only to media that is not neutral
 ve saare press ke bare main aisa nahin kehete hai

 Can big newspapers in India write such editorials in favor of small newspapers, do they include small newspapers in their campaign of press freedom? This New York Times editorial gives you a glimpse of how far behind we are in expressing democratic values
 isliye hindi ke patrkaar jinka jivan hindi ke akhabaaron main nishchit hi nasht hone vaala he, unhen ise padhanaa chahie
 Sometimes self-education saves itself from destruction
 akhbaar or patrakarita nasht ho jaaenge magar ek padhaa likhaa sachet patrkaar bachaa rahegaa
 If he survives, everything will be fine again
 ab aap america ke di bastal globe akhbaar kii site par jaaen
 Wrote about this campaign there
 is akhbaar ne un sabhi akhabaaron ke sampadakeey board se sampark saadhaa jo udaar mulyon or press kii azaadi main yakeen rakhte hai
 "the main focus of President Trump's politics is his constant attack on the free press
" patrakaron ko amareeki naagarik nahin mana jaataa he balki unhen logon ke dushman kii tarah pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 Continued attacks on the free press will have dangerous consequences
 isliye hamane desh bhar ke sabhi chote or bade udaaravaadi or rudhiwaadi akhbaaron ke sampadakeey board se sampark kiya ki ve in buniyadi hamalon ko lekar apane shabdon main sampadakeey likhen
 " jab desh main koi bhi bhrasht satta kaabiz hoti he tab uskaa kaam hota he ki azaad press kii jagah sarkaar sanchalit media ko le aae
 Today in America, we have a President who has prepared such a view that the part of the media that does not support the policies of the present administration is an enemy of the people
 raashtrapati dwaara failaae gaye kai jhooth main se ek jhooth yah bhi he
 “freedom of the press is mandatory for the protection of freedom
 " jon adam kaa yah sutara vaakya 200 saalon se zyaada amareeki siddhanton kaa hissaa rahaa he jisane patrakaron kii desh main raksha kii he
 Has been a model for the press in other countries of the world
 aaj is par gambhir khatara he
 From Beijing to Baghdad and Ankara to Moscow, dictators are constantly giving signals that journalists can be declared enemies of the public
 swatantrat samaaj ke liye press anivaary he kyonki yah netaaon par aankh band kar bharosa nahin karata he
 Whether he is a member of the Local Planning Board or the White House
 yah sirf sanyog nahin he ki maujuuda raashtrapati ke vittiya maamalon main kai jhol hai, jinke sandigdh vyaavhaaron ke chalate unheen ke justise department ne unki jaanch ke liye ek swatantra vakil kii niyukti kii he
 Now such a president has tried very hard to threaten those journalists who independently reveal many facts
 america main sabake bich ek sthapit or nishpaksh sahmati rahi he ki press kii bhoomika mahatvapurn he
 Even after this, there are many Americans who do not follow this opinion
 is maheene Ipsos ne ek survey kiya tha jisamen 48 fisadi republic samarthakon ne mana he ki news media amareeki janata kaa dushman he
 In another survey, 51 percent of Republicans compared the press to the enemy of the public
 loktantr kaa ahm hissaa nahin mana he
 Trump's attack explains why his supporters support this undemocratic attitude
 ek chauthai amareeki ab kehane lage hai ki raashtrapati ke paas karaab bartaav karne vaale press ko band karne kaa adhikaar hona chahie
 13 percent of the people in this survey have said that the President should discontinue news media such as CNN, The Washington Post and The New York Times
 apane samarthakon ko uksaane vaala yah model bataa rahaa he ki 21veen sadi ke taanashaah rus ke putin or turki ke erdogan kaise kaam karte hai
 You do not need to officially declare Centurieship to stop the information
 trump ke samarthak is baat par jor dete hai ki unka ishaara sirf us media kii taraf he jo tatasth nahin he
 They do not say this about the entire press
 lekin raashtrapati ke apane hi shabd or unka record baar-baar yahi bataata he ki samarthakon ke is tark main kitni beyimaani he
 The founders of America realized that the press could not be neutral, yet they ensured the freedom of the press and journalists in the constitution
 thomas jeffrasan ne likhaa tha ki hamaari swatantraaa press kii swatantraaa par nirbhar karti he or uski koi seemaa nahin tay kii ja sakati he
 From the founders of the constitution to the leaders of all parties, there have been complaints from the media
 media par aarope lagaate rahe hai lekin ek santhaan ke rup main press kaa hameshaa sammaan kiya gaya he
 It is not long before Republican President Ronald Regan said that our tradition of free press has been and will remain an integral and important part of our democracy
 1971 main supreme court ke justise hugo blike ne likhaa tha ki press kaa kaam shasit kii seva karnaa he na ki shaasha kaa
 Today Trump takes with him the same media that advocates his leadership
 sawaal nahin karata he
 If seen, only the President is not dividing the people for his political and personal benefits
 ve apane samarthakon se bhi kehete hai ki wo jo kah rahe hai usee kaa anukaran karen
 Last month in Kansas, he said that just listen to us, don't believe the rubbish these people (press) show
 itnaa yaad rakhana ki jo aap dekh rahe hai yaa pard rahe hai vahi sirf nahin ho rahaa he
 George Orwell stated in his novel 1984 that "the party who tells you not to listen to the evidence seen in your eyes and ears is the most mandatory and final decree from his side"

 phir bhi trump ke samarthakon main maatr 17 fisadi aise hai jo maanate hai ki amareeki prashasan lagaataar jhooth bolta rahata he
 His lie is becoming a fact
 soochnaaon se las nagarikon ke liye jhooth unke vajood ko nakaarta he
 The greatness of America depends on the fact that the free press is openly exposed to the truth
 press par janata kaa dushman kaa label chipkaana amareeki panrapara nahin he
 This decree is a threat to the common sense of citizenship that we have developed for two hundred years
 di boston globe kaa sampadakeey yahaan samaapt hota he

 When there is any corrupt power in the country, its job is to replace the free press with government-run media
 aaj america main hamaare paas ek aise raashtrapati hai jinhone aisi soch taiyaar kar di he ki media kaa jo hissaa maujuuda prashasan kii nitiyon ko saport nahin karata he, vah janata kaa dushman he
 It is also one of the many lies spread by the President
 "swatantraaa kii suraksha ke liye press kii swatantraaa anivaary he
 "this formula of John Adam has been part of American principles for over 200 years that have protected journalists in the country
 duniya ke anya deshon main press ke liye model kaa kaam karata rahaa he
 Today it is in serious danger
 beijing se baghdad or ankara se lekar moscow tak ke taanaashaahon kii taraf se ye signal lagaataar diya ja rahaa he ki patrakaron ko janata kaa dushman ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he
 The press is indispensable for an independent society because it does not trust politicians blindly
 chaahe wo sthaneey yojana board ke sadsy hon yaa phir white house ke
 It is not a mere coincidence that the current president has a lot of strings attached in financial matters, due to which he has been appointed by his own Justice Department as an independent counsel to investigate him
 ab aise raashtrapati ne un patrakaron ko dhamkaane kii bahut koshish kii he jo swatantra rup se kai tathyon ko saamne laate hai
 There has been an established and unbiased consensus among all in America that the role of the press is important
 iske baad bhi ab aise bahut se american hai jo is mat ko nahin maanate hai
 This month, Ipsos conducted a survey in which 48 percent of Republicans believed that the news media was an enemy of the American public
 ek or survey main 51 fisadi republican ne press kii tulana janata ke dushman se kii he
 Is not considered an important part of democracy
 trump ke hamale se pataa chalata he ki kyon unke samarthak is aloktantric ravaiye kaa samarthan karte hai
 a quarter of Americans are now saying that the president should have the authority to shut down the ill-treated press
 is survey main shaamil 13 fisadi logon ne kaha he ki raashtrapati ko CNN, The Washington Post and The New York Times jaise samachar madhyamon ko band kar dena chahie
 This model, provoking its supporters, is describing how 21st-century dictators, Russia's Putin and Turkey's Erdogan, work
 aapako soochnaaon ko rokane ke liye aadhikarik rup se sensharship ke elaan kii zarurat hi nahin he
 Trump's supporters insist that his reference is only to media that is not neutral
 ve saare press ke bare main aisa nahin kehete hai
 But the President's own words and his record repeatedly show how dishonest this argument of supporters is
 america ke sansthaapakon ne is baat ko mahasoos kiya tha ki press tatasth nahin bhi ho saktaa he phir bhi unhone samvidhan main press or patrakaron kii swatantraaa ko sunishchit kiya tha
 Thomas Jefferson wrote that our freedom depends on the freedom of the press and there can be no limit

 Now such a president has tried very hard to threaten those journalists who independently reveal many facts

 Trump's supporters insist that his reference is only to media that is not neutral
 ve saare press ke bare main aisa nahin kehete hai
 But the President's own words and his record repeatedly show how dishonest this argument of supporters is
 america ke sansthaapakon ne is baat ko mahasoos kiya tha ki press tatasth nahin bhi ho saktaa he phir bhi unhone samvidhan main press or patrakaron kii swatantraaa ko sunishchit kiya tha
 Thomas Jefferson wrote that our freedom depends on the freedom of the press and there can be no limit
 samvidhan ke sansthaapakon se lekar sabhi dalon ke netaaon ko media se shikaayatein rahi hai
 The media has been accused but the press has always been respected as an institution

 The founders of America realized that the press could not be neutral, yet they ensured the freedom of the press and journalists in the constitution
 thomas jeffrasan ne likhaa tha ki hamaari swatantraaa press kii swatantraaa par nirbhar karti he or uski koi seemaa nahin tay kii ja sakati he
 From the founders of the constitution to the leaders of all parties, there have been complaints from the media
 media par aarope lagaate rahe hai lekin ek santhaan ke rup main press kaa hameshaa sammaan kiya gaya he
 It is not long before Republican President Ronald Regan said that our tradition of free press has been and will remain an integral and important part of our democracy
 1971 main supreme court ke justise hugo blike ne likhaa tha ki press kaa kaam shasit kii seva karnaa he na ki shaasha kaa
 Today Trump takes with him the same media that advocates his leadership
 sawaal nahin karata he
 If seen, only the President is not dividing the people for his political and personal benefits
 ve apane samarthakon se bhi kehete hai ki wo jo kah rahe hai usee kaa anukaran karen
 Last month in Kansas, he said that just listen to us, don't believe the rubbish these people (press) show
 itnaa yaad rakhana ki jo aap dekh rahe hai yaa pard rahe hai vahi sirf nahin ho rahaa he
 George Orwell stated in his novel 1984 that "the party who tells you not to listen to the evidence seen in your eyes and ears is the most mandatory and final decree from his side"
 " George Orwell put it more gracefully in his novel "1984

 unhone kaha, 'jediu-argedy vaale chater-patar kar rahe hai
 The people of Bihar are hot
 aise main jediu or argedy ke bich khalabali he
 Sadhu Yadav, while citing leaders with surreal image like Surjbhan Singh, Prabhunath Singh, Anant Singh, Pappu Yadav's hawala, said that both parties are making false claims of establishing good governance and removing jungle rule
 maanjhi ne kii thi modi kii taribehal hi main jahanabad kii ek raily main jeethanram maanjhi ne saream kaha tha, 'maine narendra modi se dosti kaa haath badhaane kaa kaam kiya he
 Modi talks about the development of the poor and the poor and i am also a poor among the poor

 However, Manjhi left for Delhi after meeting Sadhu Yadav on 16 January
