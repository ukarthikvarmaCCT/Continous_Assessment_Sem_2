 After the luxury budget task in Big Boss, it is now the turn to choose the next captain of the house
 nae captain ke liye do daavedaaron ko chunaa janaa he
 Arshi Khan and Shilpa Shinde are fighting a battle for captaincy
 darasal, arshi ko big bos captency task ke liye sanchaalak punish or lagjri bajet task kii vijeta team main se kinhin do logon ko chunane ko kehete hai
 Arshi has to decide the name with the mutual consent of all these people
 maujuuda captain arshi ne pehle hi saaf kar diya he ki wo punish ko daavedaar nahin banaaegi
 Back in the Bigg Boss house, punish-arshi chugged, cried fiercely
 Now Arshi has to choose Vikas, Shilpa Shinde, Luv Tyagi and two of her own
 lav, shilpa or arshi khud captain bananaa chaahate hai
 But Vikas wants Shilpa to be the captain
 isi ko lekar ab ghar main nai jang shuru ho gai he
 a post shared by @reality_informerondec 15, 2017 at 3:33 am PST Shilpa Shinde, who has not shown any interest in captivity for the past several weeks, wants to become captain this time
 lekin arshi unhen captain banane ke sakht khilaaf hai
 She feels that Shilpa has no need for immunity
 vahiin lav kaa maananaa he ki ve is hafte ghar se baahar ho sakate hai isliye ek baar captain bananaa chaahate hai
 Bizarre task in Bigg Boss: Arshi Pregnant, Priyank wore Bikini Arshi and Shilpa asks Vikas to become Captain to end this debate
 lekin vikaas ko captain nahin bananaa he
 The promo for this episode, to be held on Friday, is very funny
 ab dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki nae captain kii jimmedaari kise milegi
 The celebrities who came home last week told Shilpa that she fought for the Captaincy
 host salmaan khan ne bhi unhen captensi ko gambhirtha se lene ko kaha tha
 Perhaps this is the reason Shilpa is determined to become captain this time

 It is proposed to provide 'definite health services to all' in the country through this policy

 Earlier, the decision on the National Health Policy was deferred in the last two meetings of the Union Cabinet
 vaise mantrimandal ke agenda main swasthya ko moulik adhikaar banane kaa zikr nahin tha kyonki iske kanoonee nattejey honge lekin yah pakki swasthya sevaaon ko prastaavit karata he

 IPL champions Kolkata Knight Riders team defeated Chennai Super Kings by three wickets in the first match of this season of Champions League T20 tournament

 Hello Ravish Kumar, i know you will laugh whether there is a university series today
 darasal bharat kii ucch shiksha par hansane ke liye hi bachaa he
 Two or four college colleges have been named as Center for Excellence and the rest have been left to turn into junk
 hamaari series se ye pataa chal gaya ki hamaare rajaneta bade ziddi hai
 Nobody spoke on this bad condition of higher education
 hamen isi kii ummid thi, kushi bhi hui ki nahin bol rahe hai
 You have given this trust to them
 bharat ke sainkadon kalejon kii haalat khandhar se bhi badtar ho chuki he, na aap bole, na teacheron ne bolaa or na chaatro ne bolaa
 Then why would the leader speak
 jab unka kaam hindu muslim taapic se chal jaataa he to ve kyon aapke saamne aakar kalejon ko thik karne kaa vaada karenge
 It seems good that many of you understand this pattern of channels and newspapers, especially Hindi newspapers
 jahaan javabdehi kaa hisaab kam maanga jaataa he, bhaashan kaa prachaar zyaada hota he
 But can you get out of this tunnel made by media
 mujhe nahin lagata
 Not only us, you are also trapped
 do chaar apwaad swaroop acchhee or zordaar khabaren aati rahengi magar uske baad surang main tubalite buja di jaaegi
 The leader will have control over the media and he will decide what subject you will discuss tonight
 kabhi kabhi ham jaison ko bharam ho jaataa he ki aspataal or kalejon kii baat kar netaaon ke paidaa kii gai bahason ki disha modi ja sakati he
 Only our parts have written necklace
 ham yah jaanate hai magar mazaa tab aata he jab aap haarane ke liye haarate hai
 This loss also has to be like yours
 aap bhi to haare hue hai
 So overall the university series failed completely
 unhen hi acha laga jinhen lagata tha ki is samasya ko koi media par dikhaa de
 He was happy to see his problem on TV
 darasal ham ab samaadhaan nahin chaahate hai, jis samasya ko rose dekhte hai, use tivi par dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Telling this, neither my heart is sad nor my heart is small
 khushi he ki isse chhutkaaraa milane kaa vakt kareeb aa rahaa he
 
 
 Actually, even if the leaders speak, what will they say? ve reating, rekking or centre for exlence jaise jumale le aaenge or aapako duniya kii sau uniwarsity main ek do uniwarsity ko dekhne kaa sapana thama jaaenge
 This is also a pattern
 netaa ko bhi pataa he ki ab iskaa samaadhaan nahin ho saktaa he
 So create an image of the solution
 wo image he rekking or reating
 Hundreds of colleges will be lying like junk, we and you will go to sleep after hearing the news of twenty universities coming into hundred universities of the world
 uniwarsity series kaa chaudaavaan ank main ham chalenge uttar pradesh ke mirzapur
 The Home Minister of India will see the condition of the college of Rajnath Singh
 kebi snatakottar kalege
 The college is named after Kanhaiya Lal Agarwal and Basant Lal Agarwal, who were two brothers, gave enough land and property for the college
 kalege kii zamin shahar main bhi he magar pataa chalaa ki un par kabza ho gaya he
 The Agrawal brothers were big traders of the city
 donon bhai ne milakar yah kalege banaaya tha
 You can also see the city with a camera
 lagata he ki is shahar main koi bhi angrezi channel nahin dekhtaa he, na dekhne kii vajah se nesan ko lekar ho rahe bavaal se cat gaya he
 The ghat of this city is very beautiful
 aap dekhie, ghat kii is tasviir ko
 Someone must have created that till today, despite all the hard work of neglect departments
 ghat kii kalakriti kitni darshneey he
 You know that Home Minister Rajnath Singh has been a student of this era
 biessi kii padhai yahi puri kii
 msc Physics from Gorakhpur University
 1971 main yahaan sahaayak professor ke taur par niyukt hue the
 Rajnath Singh joined this college till 2000, then resigned from this college after becoming the Chief Minister of UP
 rajnath singh saamaanya netaa nahin he
 He became the national president of the BJP after the Chief Minister and is currently the Home Minister of India
 sabko ummid rahati he ki koi jis kalege se nikal kar mukhyamantri, grahamantri bana he, apane kalege kaa haal to thik karegaa
 Many leaders of India will fail with this scale
 1991-92 main jab upi main pehali baar bhaajapa kii sarkaar bani thi tab rajnath singh shiksha mantri bane the
 He had earned a lot in stopping copying
 grahamantri rajnath singh jis physics vibhaag main shikshak the aaj vahaan koi bhi permanent teacher nahin he
 There are two part-time teachers who get salary up to ten thousand rupees
 chaatr koching ke sahare paas hote hai
 a teacher told that those who are poor are unable to do coaching, as a result, students coming from first year to second year become aware of the education system of India and they abandon it and go elsewhere
 jinhen ham angrezi main drops out karte hai
 Ideally they should not be called out, thrown out, meaning the college took admission but was thrown out after some time
 thrown out kahenge to janata jaag jaaegi isliye ham drop out bolte hai taaki janata ko yah bataaya jaae ki tumne khud se kalege ko choda he
 Although there is no Permanent Teacher in the Physics Department for 10-12 years, Home Minister Rajnath Singh is a permanent character of Indian politics
 unhen chaah kar bhi koi nahin hilaa sakaa
 Forgot to say that 350 students study in Physics Department
 botni vibhaag main bhi koi teacher nahin he
 Teaching a part-time student, hoping to be full-time
 ajay singh ke zarie ham is mahaan kalege tak pahunch paae, baaki kaam indresh pandey ne kar diya
 After somehow opening the college and seeing the condition of the lab, it became clear that those who sold the churn to make India a world guru have no concern with the gurus or laboratories of India
 agar aap yah samaj rahe hai ki yah dhulakanon ke gunon par shodh karne vaali prayogshaala he to aap galat nahin he
 This laboratory should be named as Abushalaya and an advertisement should be made and shown on TV that without this we can give speech to the youth and take votes from them
 yahaan upkarnon par jo dhul jami he wo darasal yahi kah rahi he ki bharat ke kalejon main sab kuch mit sakati he, magar dhul nahin mit sakati he
 Dust is immortal like a soul
 zarur ziladhikari is sho ke baad principal ko kaaran bataao notice jari karegaa lekin in dhulakanon ko pataa he ki anushaasan unhone nahin todaa he
 She is frozen in silence
 anushaasan prime time ke is ankar ne todaa he jo raajnneeti kii rozaana nautanki ke bich is prayogshaala main camera lekar bhatak rahaa tha
 You will go to this lab alone one night, i am sure that you will be seen making beedis here from Newton to the Galleys
 madam curi or edison kii hansi sunai degi or jagadish bose lekar homi bhabha tak yahaan chand par ug aane vaale ped paudhon ko kavita suna rahe honge
 We cannot get information about whether the tender of beaker and test tube comes out regularly
 balrampur ke kalege kaa haal dikhaane ke baad ek chaatr ne messej kiya, kaha ki aapane yah to bataaya nahin ki prayogshaala main paas karaane ke liye shikshak yaa sahaayak paise lete hai
 They earn a lot
 hamaare paas aisi baton kii jaanch karne ke liye utani badi team nahin he
 To cover the state of India's higher education, two lakh correspondents and twenty thousand correspondents are needed, which we do not have
 bharat ke kalege bharat kii javaaniyon kalejon main aakar kabad ban jaati hai
 By the way, the science in which science is dying
 vahaan shikshakon ke atendence ke liye biometric aa gaya he
 Put a thumb impression, ring it and attend
 is tarah ham is mashin ke zarie nae bharat main pravesh kar jate hai lekin uske baad aapako puraane bharat main hi pahunchnaa hota he
 79 teachers posts are approved for 5000 students but only 31 are there
 31 shikshakon ko dekhakar hi koi gin degaa lekin ham 2022 ke bharat main enter kar rahe hai isliye biometric mashin zaruri he
 Students' union elections are going on in this college
 adhyaksh ke ummidavaar ne bataaya he ki unke adhyaksh banane ke baad sudhaar kiya jayega
 This is the quality of the election, after that everything gets to see the cinema
 jo chunaav ke saath khatm ho jaataa he
 It seems that there is no life left in the zoological department building
 yahaan koi praani nahin aata hoga
 The college building is sick
 aap kebi piji kalege kii imaarat kaa haal dekhte chaliye
 The floor is broken
 peya jal kii vyavastha kaa haal dekhie
 It seems that the students of this college do not feel thirsty
 unhone nal kaa istamaal karnaa 21veen sadi ke shuru hote hi band kar diya he
 When there is no drinking water then why is there a toilet
 kya yah vigyaan kaa koi chamatkaar he yaa phir hamaari barbaadi kaa sanskaar
 There was a lock in a toilet, the woman is near the principal's cabin so they locked it
 prisimple ashavan hai ki sab kuch thik ho jayega
 Check the condition of this toilet of KB College
 kya ummid kii jaae ki grahamantri rajnath singh apane grih zile ke is kalege kaa haal badal denge
 Many reporters are interviewing the same leader daily in the context of Gujarat elections, they should go to colleges in Gujarat
 us kalege main jahaan pradhanmantri padhe hai
 So that a comparison can be made whether Home Minister Rajnath Singh is better at taking care of his colleges or for development or Prime Minister Modi
 is tarah ke swasthy mukaable se raajnneeti bhi behatar hoti he
 The second college in Mirzapur is Kamala Aryakanya Postgraduate Mahavidlaya
 1968 main banakar taiyaar hua
 It is the only women's college in Mirajapur
 baahar se kalege kii imaarat thik thaak hi dikhti he
 About 1200 students in various disciplines have a future here
 hindi kii class kii ladakiyon ne bataaya ki kai dinon se koi padhaane vaala nahin aayaa he to kya karen, gapp shapp hi karenge
 Studies were going on in a class
 hamane ujisi kii guideline dekhi
 The same guideline in which applications have been sought from 20 colleges to become world class universities
 usamen kaha he ki world class banane ke liye 1 shikshak par 20 chaatr hone chahie
 This thing sounded like a dream
 yahaan to ek bhi teacher nahin hai or jahaan ek hai un par 20 nahin,1200 tak chaatr hai
 Before the Lok Sabha elections and after the elections, Prime Minister Modi used to say that India will export teachers
 tab sunakar mujhe bhi laga ki yah bahut acha
 The idea of export of teachers is also new, although in which country imported teachers are waiting
 ho saktaa he aisa koi desh ho magar uniwarsity series ke dauraan yah baat samaj main aa gai he ki bharat ko is vakt shikshakon ke aayaat kii zarurat he
 Colleges in the city are deserted without teachers
 niryaat kii baat baad main karenge
 First, the position of teachers in their colleges should be evaluated according to the new number of students
 26 disambar 2014 ko pradhanmantri ne biechayu main new teacher training skim kii buniyaad rakhte hue kaha tha ki bharat ko taap class shikshakon ke niryaat kaa lakshya rakhana chahie
 He said that the world is looking at us but is not ready
 bharat ke kalege bhi kisi kii taraf dekh rahe honge, unke liye bhi koi taiyaar nahin he
 On 26 December 2014, the Prime Minister laid the foundation of Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya National Mission on Teacher and Training
 900 karod kii yah mahatvakanjhi yojana kaa taaja haal he ki nideshak kii niyukti ho gai he
 BHU has given five acres of land and the tendering process for the building has started here
 pradhanmantri ne jis yojana kaa shubharambh kiya ho uskaa tender bhi shuru hone main teen saal lag jaataa he
 At the moment, the same information has been received
 us vakt pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki shikshakon kii bahut maang hai
 He had said that India's education system is not designed to make robots
 ham parampara aadhaarit shiksha kii samskruti kaa utpaadan karte hai
 The Prime Minister also talked about the export of teachers on the Madison Square
 piemindia kii website par bhaashan maujuud hai
 On September 28, 2014, it was said that by the time of 2020, such a large amount of workcourse will be needed in the world
 inke yahaan sab buudhe buudhe log honge
 The world will not have workmen
 ham puri duniya ko workforce supplai kar sakate hai
 Today there is a demand for teachers in the world
 Maths or Science ke teachers nahin milte hai
 Can India not export these teachers? yahi baat unhone 17 november 2014 ko sidney ke alphons arina main kahi thi
 We had said in Sydney that we export the best quality teacher in the world, we can make the whole world our own
 bharat ke lakhon skulon or hazaron kalejon ko maths, science, history, hindi, sanskrit se lekar tamaam vishyon ke shikshakon kii zarurat he
 Youngsters are getting old waiting for jobs by passing the UGC NET exam
 bied kii degree lekar rose rojgaar samachar ke panne palatate hai
 The idea of exporting is good but it was so good that it did not even realize that the colleges in our neighborhood also need to import teachers
 amravati zila maharashtra kaa ajukeshan hub mana jaataa he kyonki yahaan par ejineering se lekar medical sab hai
 Private as well as government
 hamaare sahyogi sanjay shinde amravati zile ke vadhona ramnath gaanv gaye
 This village is just 45 km from Amravati city
 gaanv kii aabaadi paanch hazaar kii he
 Only the farmers live
 teen chaar kamare main chal rahe is kalege ko dekhakar yakeenan pradhanmantri se kaha ja saktaa he ki teacher ke niryaat se pehle aap is tarah ke kalejon kaa bharat se niryaat kar den
 This college has been running for twelve years
 privet he lekin amravati uniwarsity se manyata praapt he
 There is neither a playground after this, nor a laboratory
 aas paas ke kisaano ke bachche yahaan admician lekar kalege main padhane kaa bharam paalate hai
 Teachers working here for many years get a salary of only 5000 rupees
 neutnam mazaduri se kam, manaregaa ke rate se bhi kam par kaam kar rahe hai
 The official rate is 240 rupees per period
 is hisaab se bhi shikshakon ko kam miltaa he
 Nearly 200 students study here
 yahaan par ek bhi shikshak permanent nahin he
 Colleges in India are warehouses to enslave teachers
 chaatro ko barbaad karne kaa kaarkaana
 Just ten km from the village where the college is located, is the village of Punjab Rao Deshmukh, India's first agriculture minister
 shikshak kehete hai ki paanch hazaar rupee main ham kaise jivan chalaayenge
 Several posts of teachers have been vacant in Amravati Sant Gadge Baba University
 yahaan kii imaarat to acchhee he magar kai vibhaagon main lekturer ke pad khaali hai
 Is a Professor Permanente in Hindi Department
 hindi kii jagah marathi ke professor kii niyukti ho gai he
 Sociology department has only 2 professors
 kai department aise hai jo ek ek professor ke bharose chal rahe hai
 The comments professor ke 17 pad mazur hai magar 11 khaali hai
 Assistant Professor has 29 posts, but 11 are vacant
 lekturer ke 65 pad manzur hai magar 11 khaali hai
 The university has sent a proposal to the government that more than 130 teachers are needed, uniwarsity series kaa yah chaudaavaan ank aapako kaisaa laga, ye hamen nahin, apane padosi ko bataaiye, aapas main charchaa kiijie ki karnaa kya he
 Should the factory of waste of time be closed in the name of higher education in India or should the colleges be exported to India along with teachers
 ham chaah len to bekaar pade in kalejon kaa niryaat kar sakate hai
 As we are about to export teachers
 brake le lete hai
 Then why would the leader speak
 jab unka kaam hindu muslim taapic se chal jaataa he to ve kyon aapke saamne aakar kalejon ko thik karne kaa vaada karenge
 It seems good that many of you understand this pattern of channels and newspapers, especially Hindi newspapers
 jahaan javabdehi kaa hisaab kam maanga jaataa he, bhaashan kaa prachaar zyaada hota he
 But can you get out of this tunnel made by media
 mujhe nahin lagata
 Not only us, you are also trapped
 do chaar apwaad swaroop acchhee or zordaar khabaren aati rahengi magar uske baad surang main tubalite buja di jaaegi
 The leader will have control over the media and he will decide what subject you will discuss tonight
 kabhi kabhi ham jaison ko bharam ho jaataa he ki aspataal or kalejon kii baat kar netaaon ke paidaa kii gai bahason ki disha modi ja sakati he
 Only our parts have written necklace
 ham yah jaanate hai magar mazaa tab aata he jab aap haarane ke liye haarate hai
 This loss also has to be like yours
 aap bhi to haare hue hai
 So overall the university series failed completely
 unhen hi acha laga jinhen lagata tha ki is samasya ko koi media par dikhaa de
 He was happy to see his problem on TV
 darasal ham ab samaadhaan nahin chaahate hai, jis samasya ko rose dekhte hai, use tivi par dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Telling this, neither my heart is sad nor my heart is small
 khushi he ki isse chhutkaaraa milane kaa vakt kareeb aa rahaa he
 
 
 Actually, even if the leaders speak, what will they say? ve reating, rekking or centre for exlence jaise jumale le aaenge or aapako duniya kii sau uniwarsity main ek do uniwarsity ko dekhne kaa sapana thama jaaenge
 This is also a pattern
 netaa ko bhi pataa he ki ab iskaa samaadhaan nahin ho saktaa he
 So create an image of the solution
 wo image he rekking or reating
 Hundreds of colleges will be lying like junk, we and you will go to sleep after hearing the news of twenty universities coming into hundred universities of the world
 uniwarsity series kaa chaudaavaan ank main ham chalenge uttar pradesh ke mirzapur
 The Home Minister of India will see the condition of the college of Rajnath Singh
 kebi snatakottar kalege
 The college is named after Kanhaiya Lal Agarwal and Basant Lal Agarwal, who were two brothers, gave enough land and property for the college
 kalege kii zamin shahar main bhi he magar pataa chalaa ki un par kabza ho gaya he
 The Agrawal brothers were big traders of the city
 donon bhai ne milakar yah kalege banaaya tha
 You can also see the city with a camera
 lagata he ki is shahar main koi bhi angrezi channel nahin dekhtaa he, na dekhne kii vajah se nesan ko lekar ho rahe bavaal se cat gaya he
 The ghat of this city is very beautiful
 aap dekhie, ghat kii is tasviir ko
 Someone must have created that till today, despite all the hard work of neglect departments
 ghat kii kalakriti kitni darshneey he
 You know that Home Minister Rajnath Singh has been a student of this era
 biessi kii padhai yahi puri kii
 msc Physics from Gorakhpur University
 1971 main yahaan sahaayak professor ke taur par niyukt hue the
 Rajnath Singh joined this college till 2000, then resigned from this college after becoming the Chief Minister of UP
 rajnath singh saamaanya netaa nahin he
 He became the national president of the BJP after the Chief Minister and is currently the Home Minister of India
 sabko ummid rahati he ki koi jis kalege se nikal kar mukhyamantri, grahamantri bana he, apane kalege kaa haal to thik karegaa
 Many leaders of India will fail with this scale
 1991-92 main jab upi main pehali baar bhaajapa kii sarkaar bani thi tab rajnath singh shiksha mantri bane the
 He had earned a lot in stopping copying
 grahamantri rajnath singh jis physics vibhaag main shikshak the aaj vahaan koi bhi permanent teacher nahin he
 There are two part-time teachers who get salary up to ten thousand rupees
 chaatr koching ke sahare paas hote hai
 a teacher told that those who are poor are unable to do coaching, as a result, students coming from first year to second year become aware of the education system of India and they abandon it and go elsewhere
 jinhen ham angrezi main drops out karte hai
 Ideally they should not be called out, thrown out, meaning the college took admission but was thrown out after some time
 thrown out kahenge to janata jaag jaaegi isliye ham drop out bolte hai taaki janata ko yah bataaya jaae ki tumne khud se kalege ko choda he
 Although there is no Permanent Teacher in the Physics Department for 10-12 years, Home Minister Rajnath Singh is a permanent character of Indian politics
 unhen chaah kar bhi koi nahin hilaa sakaa
 Forgot to say that 350 students study in Physics Department
 botni vibhaag main bhi koi teacher nahin he
 Teaching a part-time student, hoping to be full-time
 ajay singh ke zarie ham is mahaan kalege tak pahunch paae, baaki kaam indresh pandey ne kar diya
 After somehow opening the college and seeing the condition of the lab, it became clear that those who sold the churn to make India a world guru have no concern with the gurus or laboratories of India
 agar aap yah samaj rahe hai ki yah dhulakanon ke gunon par shodh karne vaali prayogshaala he to aap galat nahin he
 This laboratory should be named as Abushalaya and an advertisement should be made and shown on TV that without this we can give speech to the youth and take votes from them
 yahaan upkarnon par jo dhul jami he wo darasal yahi kah rahi he ki bharat ke kalejon main sab kuch mit sakati he, magar dhul nahin mit sakati he
 Dust is immortal like a soul
 zarur ziladhikari is sho ke baad principal ko kaaran bataao notice jari karegaa lekin in dhulakanon ko pataa he ki anushaasan unhone nahin todaa he
 She is frozen in silence
 anushaasan prime time ke is ankar ne todaa he jo raajnneeti kii rozaana nautanki ke bich is prayogshaala main camera lekar bhatak rahaa tha
 You will go to this lab alone one night, i am sure that you will be seen making beedis here from Newton to the Galleys
 madam curi or edison kii hansi sunai degi or jagadish bose lekar homi bhabha tak yahaan chand par ug aane vaale ped paudhon ko kavita suna rahe honge
 We cannot get information about whether the tender of beaker and test tube comes out regularly
 balrampur ke kalege kaa haal dikhaane ke baad ek chaatr ne messej kiya, kaha ki aapane yah to bataaya nahin ki prayogshaala main paas karaane ke liye shikshak yaa sahaayak paise lete hai
 They earn a lot
 hamaare paas aisi baton kii jaanch karne ke liye utani badi team nahin he
 To cover the state of India's higher education, two lakh correspondents and twenty thousand correspondents are needed, which we do not have
 bharat ke kalege bharat kii javaaniyon kalejon main aakar kabad ban jaati hai
 By the way, the science in which science is dying
 vahaan shikshakon ke atendence ke liye biometric aa gaya he
 Put a thumb impression, ring it and attend
 is tarah ham is mashin ke zarie nae bharat main pravesh kar jate hai lekin uske baad aapako puraane bharat main hi pahunchnaa hota he
 79 teachers posts are approved for 5000 students but only 31 are there
 31 shikshakon ko dekhakar hi koi gin degaa lekin ham 2022 ke bharat main enter kar rahe hai isliye biometric mashin zaruri he
 Students' union elections are going on in this college
 adhyaksh ke ummidavaar ne bataaya he ki unke adhyaksh banane ke baad sudhaar kiya jayega
 This is the quality of the election, after that everything gets to see the cinema
 jo chunaav ke saath khatm ho jaataa he
 It seems that there is no life left in the zoological department building
 yahaan koi praani nahin aata hoga
 The college building is sick
 aap kebi piji kalege kii imaarat kaa haal dekhte chaliye
 The floor is broken
 peya jal kii vyavastha kaa haal dekhie
 It seems that the students of this college do not feel thirsty
 unhone nal kaa istamaal karnaa 21veen sadi ke shuru hote hi band kar diya he
 When there is no drinking water then why is there a toilet
 kya yah vigyaan kaa koi chamatkaar he yaa phir hamaari barbaadi kaa sanskaar
 There was a lock in a toilet, the woman is near the principal's cabin so they locked it
 prisimple ashavan hai ki sab kuch thik ho jayega
 Check the condition of this toilet of KB College
 kya ummid kii jaae ki grahamantri rajnath singh apane grih zile ke is kalege kaa haal badal denge
 Many reporters are interviewing the same leader daily in the context of Gujarat elections, they should go to colleges in Gujarat
 us kalege main jahaan pradhanmantri padhe hai
 So that a comparison can be made whether Home Minister Rajnath Singh is better at taking care of his colleges or for development or Prime Minister Modi
 is tarah ke swasthy mukaable se raajnneeti bhi behatar hoti he
 The second college in Mirzapur is Kamala Aryakanya Postgraduate Mahavidlaya
 1968 main banakar taiyaar hua
 It is the only women's college in Mirajapur
 baahar se kalege kii imaarat thik thaak hi dikhti he
 About 1200 students in various disciplines have a future here
 hindi kii class kii ladakiyon ne bataaya ki kai dinon se koi padhaane vaala nahin aayaa he to kya karen, gapp shapp hi karenge
 Studies were going on in a class
 hamane ujisi kii guideline dekhi
 The same guideline in which applications have been sought from 20 colleges to become world class universities
 usamen kaha he ki world class banane ke liye 1 shikshak par 20 chaatr hone chahie
 This thing sounded like a dream
 yahaan to ek bhi teacher nahin hai or jahaan ek hai un par 20 nahin,1200 tak chaatr hai
 Before the Lok Sabha elections and after the elections, Prime Minister Modi used to say that India will export teachers
 tab sunakar mujhe bhi laga ki yah bahut acha
 The idea of export of teachers is also new, although in which country imported teachers are waiting
 ho saktaa he aisa koi desh ho magar uniwarsity series ke dauraan yah baat samaj main aa gai he ki bharat ko is vakt shikshakon ke aayaat kii zarurat he
 Colleges in the city are deserted without teachers
 niryaat kii baat baad main karenge
 First, the position of teachers in their colleges should be evaluated according to the new number of students
 26 disambar 2014 ko pradhanmantri ne biechayu main new teacher training skim kii buniyaad rakhte hue kaha tha ki bharat ko taap class shikshakon ke niryaat kaa lakshya rakhana chahie
 He said that the world is looking at us but is not ready
 bharat ke kalege bhi kisi kii taraf dekh rahe honge, unke liye bhi koi taiyaar nahin he
 On 26 December 2014, the Prime Minister laid the foundation of Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya National Mission on Teacher and Training
 900 karod kii yah mahatvakanjhi yojana kaa taaja haal he ki nideshak kii niyukti ho gai he
 BHU has given five acres of land and the tendering process for the building has started here
 pradhanmantri ne jis yojana kaa shubharambh kiya ho uskaa tender bhi shuru hone main teen saal lag jaataa he
 At the moment, the same information has been received
 us vakt pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki shikshakon kii bahut maang hai
 He had said that India's education system is not designed to make robots
 ham parampara aadhaarit shiksha kii samskruti kaa utpaadan karte hai
 The Prime Minister also talked about the export of teachers on the Madison Square
 piemindia kii website par bhaashan maujuud hai
 On September 28, 2014, it was said that by the time of 2020, such a large amount of workcourse will be needed in the world
 inke yahaan sab buudhe buudhe log honge
 The world will not have workmen
 ham puri duniya ko workforce supplai kar sakate hai
 Today there is a demand for teachers in the world
 Maths or Science ke teachers nahin milte hai
 Can India not export these teachers? yahi baat unhone 17 november 2014 ko sidney ke alphons arina main kahi thi
 We had said in Sydney that we export the best quality teacher in the world, we can make the whole world our own
 bharat ke lakhon skulon or hazaron kalejon ko maths, science, history, hindi, sanskrit se lekar tamaam vishyon ke shikshakon kii zarurat he
 Youngsters are getting old waiting for jobs by passing the UGC NET exam
 bied kii degree lekar rose rojgaar samachar ke panne palatate hai
 The idea of exporting is good but it was so good that it did not even realize that the colleges in our neighborhood also need to import teachers
 amravati zila maharashtra kaa ajukeshan hub mana jaataa he kyonki yahaan par ejineering se lekar medical sab hai

 Just ten km from the village where the college is located, is the village of Punjab Rao Deshmukh, India's first agriculture minister
 shikshak kehete hai ki paanch hazaar rupee main ham kaise jivan chalaayenge
 Several posts of teachers have been vacant in Amravati Sant Gadge Baba University
 yahaan kii imaarat to acchhee he magar kai vibhaagon main lekturer ke pad khaali hai
 Is a Professor Permanente in Hindi Department
 hindi kii jagah marathi ke professor kii niyukti ho gai he
 Sociology department has only 2 professors
 kai department aise hai jo ek ek professor ke bharose chal rahe hai
 The comments professor ke 17 pad mazur hai magar 11 khaali hai
 Assistant Professor has 29 posts, but 11 are vacant
 lekturer ke 65 pad manzur hai magar 11 khaali hai
 The university has sent a proposal to the government that more than 130 teachers are needed, uniwarsity series kaa yah chaudaavaan ank aapako kaisaa laga, ye hamen nahin, apane padosi ko bataaiye, aapas main charchaa kiijie ki karnaa kya he
 Should the factory of waste of time be closed in the name of higher education in India or should the colleges be exported to India along with teachers
 ham chaah len to bekaar pade in kalejon kaa niryaat kar sakate hai
 As we are about to export teachers
 brake le lete hai
 KB Postgraduate College
 kanhaiya laal agarwal or basant laal agarwal ke naam par yah kalege bana he, ye do bhai the, kalege ke liye kaaphi zamin or sampatti de di
 The college's land is also in the city but it is found that they have been captured
 agarwal bandhu shahar ke bade vyapaaree the
 The two brothers together formed this college
 shahar ko bhi aap camere se dekh hi lijie
 It seems that no one in the city watches the English Channel, because of not seeing it, the nation is cut off from the ruckus
 is shahar kaa ghat bahut sundar he
 You see, this picture of Ghat
 kisi ne banaaya hi hoga jo aaj tak tamaam tarah ke upeksha vibhaagon kii mehnat ke baad bhi tikaa hua he
 The view of the Ghats is so beautiful
 aap jaanate hai ki grahamantri rajnath singh isi kaalaj ke chaatr rahe hai
 He completed his bsc studies
 emessi physics gorakhpur uniwarsity se kii
 He was appointed as an assistant professor here in 1971
 2000 tak rajnath singh is kalege se jude, tab upi ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad is kalege se istipha de diya
 Rajnath Singh is not a normal leader
 mukhyamantri ke baad bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh bane or is samay bharat ke grahamantri hai
 Everyone hopes that someone from the college who has become the Chief Minister and Home Minister will fix the condition of his college
 is paimaane se bharat ke kai netaa fail ho jaaenge
 When the BJP government was formed in UP for the first time in 1991-92, Rajnath Singh became the Minister of Education
 nakal rokane main kaaphi naam kamaaya tha
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh was a teacher in the Physics Department, where there is no permanent teacher
 yahaan par do anshkalik shikshak hai jinhen das hazaar rupee tak hi selary milti he
 Students pass with coaching
 ek shikshak ne bataaya ki jo garib hote hai ve koching nahin kar pate, nateeja yah hota he ki pratham varsh se dwitiya varsh tak aate aate chaatro ko bharat kii shiksha pranali kaa bodh ho jaataa he or ve iskaa paritya kar kahin or chale jate hai
 Which we drop out in English
 kaayade se inhen drops out nahin, thrown out kahana chahie matlab jinhen kalege ne admician liya magar kuch samay ke baad baahar phenk diya
 If you say thrown out, then the public will wake up, so we say drop out so that the public is told that you have left the college by yourself
 baharhaal physics department main bhale hi das baarah saal se koi permanent teacher nahin he magar grahamantri rajnath singh bhartiya raajnneeti ke permanent kirdaar hai
 Nobody could move even after wanting them
 yah bataanaa bhul gaya ki physics department main 350 chaatr padhate hai
 There is also no teacher in the Botany department
 ek anshkali padhaa rahe hai, purnakalik hone kii ummid main
 Through Ajay Singh we were able to reach this great college, Indresh Pandey did the rest
 kisi tarah kalege khulwakar prayogshaala kaa haal dekha to yakeen ho gaya ki bharat ko vishwa guru banane kaa chuuran bechney waalon ko bharat ke guruon yaa prayogshaalaon kii koi phikr nahin he
 If you are understanding that this is a laboratory to research the properties of dust then you are not wrong
 is prayogshaala kaa naam durupyogshaala rakh dena chahie or vigyaapan banaakar tivi par dikhaanaa chahie ki ham iske bagair bhi yuvaaon ko bhaashan dekar unase vot le sakate hai
 The dust that has accumulated on the equipment here is actually saying that everything can be erased in the colleges of India, but the dust cannot disappear
 dhul aatma kii tarah amar he
 Surely the District Magistrate will issue a show cause notice to the principal after this show, but these dust mills know that they have not broken the discipline
 wo to chupchaap jami hui hai
 Discipline is broken by this prime time anchor who was wandering around the daily gimmick of politics with a camera in this lab
 aap is prayogshaala main kisi raat akele jaaiyegaa, mujhe yakeen he ki newton se lekar galileyon tak yahaan bidi banaate nazar aaenge
 Madame Curie and Edison will be heard laughing, and Jagdish Bose to Homi Bhabha will be reciting poems to the trees growing on the moon here
 hamen isaki jaankaree nahin mil sakati he ki bikar or test tub kaa tender niyamit rup se nikalataa he yaa nahin
 After showing the condition of the college of Balrampur, a student messaged, saying that you did not say that teachers or assistants take money to pass in the lab
 ve kaaphi kama lete hai
 We do not have such a large team to examine such things
 bharat kii ucch shiksha kaa haal cover karne ke liye do lakh samvaadadaata or bees hazaar samvaadadaataaon kii zarurat he jo hamaare paas nahin he
 College of India, jawans of India come to colleges and become junk
 vaise jis kalege main vigyaan dam tod rahaa he
 Biometric has come to attend teachers there
 anguuthe kaa nishaan lagaaiye, tuun taan bajaaiye or atendence ho gaya
 In this way, we enter new India through this machine, but after that you have to reach old India itself
 5000 chaatro ke liye yahaan 79 shikshakon ke pad manzur hai magar hai maatr 31
 Someone will count by looking at 31 teachers, but we are entering India in 2022, so a biometric machine is necessary
 is kalege main chaatr sangh ke chunaav chal rahe hai
 The candidate for president has stated that reforms will take place after he becomes president
 chunaav kii yahi khubi he, uske baad sab kuch badal jane kaa cinema dekhne ko miltaa he
 Which ends with the election
 praani vibhaag kii imaarat main lagata he praan hi nahin bache hai
 No creature will come here
 kalege kii imaarat biimaar he
 You see the condition of the building of KB PG College
 farsh tut chuki he
 See the condition of drinking water system
 aisa lagata he ki is kalege ke chaatro ko pyaas hi nahin lagati he
 They have stopped using the tap as early as the 21st century
 jab pani nahin pite hai to phir shauchalay kyon he
 Is it a miracle of science or a sacrament of our ruin
 ek shauchalay main taala laga hua tha, mahila principal ke cabin ke paas he isliye unhone band kar diya
 The principals are hopeful that everything will be alright
 ke bi kalege ke is shauchalay kaa haal dekh lijie
 What to expect is that Home Minister Rajnath Singh will change the condition of this college in his home district
 bahut se reporter gujarat chunaav ke sandarbh main ek hi netaa ko rose intervyuu le rahe hai unhen gujarat ke kalejon main janaa chahie
 In the college where the Prime Minister has studied
 taaki tulana kii ja sake ki apane apane kalejon kaa khyaal rakhane main, vikaas karne main grahamantri rajnath singh behatar hai yaa pradhanmantri modi
 Politics is also better than such healthy competition
 mirzapur kaa doosraa kalege he kamala aryakanya snatakottar mahavidlaay
 Completed in 1968
 meerajapur kaa ek maatr mahila kalege he
 The college building from outside looks just fine
 vibhinn vishyon main kareeb 1200 chaatro kaa yahaan bhavishya sanvar rahaa he
 Girls of Hindi class told that if no teacher has come for many days, then what to do, only gossip will do
 ek class main padhai chal rahi thi
 We saw the guidelines of the UGC
 vahi guideline jisamen vishwa stareey uniwarsity banane ke liye 20 kalejon se aavedan maanga gaya he
 It states that to become a world class, there should be 20 students per 1 teacher
 yah baat kisi khwab kii tarah lagi
 There is not a single teacher here and where there are one, there are not 20 but 1200 students
 loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle or chunaavon ke baad pradhanmantri modi kaha karte the ki bharat shikshakon kaa niryaat karegaa
 Then i also felt that it was very good
 shikshakon ke niryaat kaa idia bhi nayaa he vaise kis desh main aaayaatit shikshakon kaa intazaar ho rahaa he pataa nahin
 There may be a country like this, but during the university series it has been understood that at this time India needs to import teachers
 shahar shahar ke kalege bina shikshakon ke suune pade hai
 Will talk about exports later
 pehle apane kalejon main shikshakon ke pad ko chaatro kii nai sankhya ke hisaab se moolyankan ho
 On 26 December 2014, the Prime Minister laid the foundation of the New Teacher Training Scheme at BHU and said that India should aim to export top class teachers
 unhone kaha tha ki duniya hamaari taraf dekh rahi he magar taiyaar nahin he
 Colleges of India will also be looking towards anyone, nobody is ready for them
 26 disambar 2014 ko pradhanmantri ne pandit madan mohan malviya neshnal mishan aan teacher and training kii buniyaad rakhi thi
 It is the latest situation of this important scheme of 900 crores that the Director has been appointed
 biechayu ke paanch acre zamin de di he or yahaan bhawan banane ke tender kii prakriya shuru ho gai he
 Tender of the scheme which the Prime Minister has launched also takes three years to start
 philhal itani hi jaankaree mili he
 At that time the Prime Minister had said that there is a lot of demand for teachers
 unhone kaha tha ki bharat kii shiksha vyavastha robot banane ke liye nahin banaai gai he
 We produce a culture of tradition-based education
 shikshakon ke niryaat kii baat pradhanmantri ne medicin scavyar par bhi kii thi
 Speeches are available on pmindia's website
 28 sitambar 2014 ko kaha tha ki 2020 ke samay aate aate duniya main itani badi maatra main varccourse kii zarurat padane vaali he
 All the old people will be here
 duniya ke paas kaam karne vaale nahin honge
 We can supply the workforce to the whole world
 aaj vishwa main teachers kii maang he
 Maths and science teachers are not available
 kya bharat ye teachers export nahin kar saktaa
 He said the same thing on 17 November 2014 at Allphones Arena in Sydney
 sidney main kaha tha ki ag ham duniya main best quality ke teacher export karte hai puri duniya ko ham apana bana sakate hai
 Millions of schools and thousands of colleges in India need teachers in all subjects from Maths, Science, History, Hindi, Sanskrit
 noujvaan ujisi kii net pariksha paas kar naukariyon ke intazaar main buudhe ho rahe hai
 Every day, with a b
ed degree, they turn the pages of employment news
 niryaat karne kaa idia acha he magar wo itnaa acha laga ki khyaal hi nahin aayaa ki hamaare pados ke kalege ko bhi shikshakon ke aayaat kii zarurat he
 Amravati district is considered to be the education hub of Maharashtra as it has everything from engineering to medical
 privet bhi or sarkari bhi
 Our colleague Sanjay Shinde went to Wadhona Ramnath village in Amravati district
 amravati shahar se maatr 45 kimi dur he yah gaanv
 The village has a population of five thousand
 kisaan hi rahete hai
 Seeing this college running in three to four rooms, the Prime Minister can certainly be told that before the teacher's export, you should export such colleges from India
 yah kalege baarah saal se chal rahaa he
 Is private but accredited with Amravati University
 na to iske baad khel kaa maidan he, na hi prayogshaala he
 The children of nearby farmers take admission here to study in college
 yahaan par kai saal se kaam kar rahe shikshakon ko maatr 5000 rupee selary milti he
 Nutanam is working at less than the wages, less than the MNREGA rate
 sarkari rate he 240 rupee prati period
 According to this also teachers get less
 200 ke kareeb chaatr yahaan padhate hai
 Not a single teacher is permanent here
 bharat ke kalege shikshakon ko gulam banane ke godaam hai
 Students ruining factory
 jis gaanv main yah kalege he vahaan se maatr das kimi kii duuri par bharat ke pehle krishi mantri punjab raav deshmukh kaa gaanv he
 The teacher says how will we run a life for five thousand rupees
 amravati sant gadge baba vishvavidhyalay main shikshakon ke kai pad khaali hai
 The building here is good but lecturer posts are vacant in many departments
 hindi vibhaag main ek professor permanent hai
 Marathi professor has been appointed in place of Hindi
 samajashaastra vibhaag main keval 2 hi professor hai
 There are many departments that are running on the trust of each professor
 tippaniyan There are 17 posts of professor but 11 are vacant
 assitant professor ke 29 pad hai, magar 11 khaali hai
 The lecturer has 65 posts, but 11 are vacant
 uniwarsity ne sarkaar ke paas prastaav bheja he ki 130 se zyaada shikshakon kii zarurat he, How did you like this fourteenth issue of the university series, not us, tell your neighbor, discuss among yourself what to do
 kya bharat main ucch shiksha ke naam par samay kii barbaadi kaa kaarkaana band kar diya janaa chahie yaa shikshakon ke saath saath bharat ko kalege kaa bhi niryaat karnaa chahie
 If we wish, we can export these colleges lying idle
 jase ham shikshakon kaa niryaat karne vaale hai
 Let's take a break
 grahamantri rajnath singh jis physics vibhaag main shikshak the aaj vahaan koi bhi permanent teacher nahin he
 There are two part-time teachers who get salary up to ten thousand rupees
 chaatr koching ke sahare paas hote hai
 a teacher told that those who are poor are unable to do coaching, as a result, students coming from first year to second year become aware of the education system of India and they abandon it and go elsewhere
 jinhen ham angrezi main drops out karte hai
 Ideally they should not be called out, thrown out, meaning the college took admission but was thrown out after some time
 thrown out kahenge to janata jaag jaaegi isliye ham drop out bolte hai taaki janata ko yah bataaya jaae ki tumne khud se kalege ko choda he
 Although there is no Permanent Teacher in the Physics Department for 10-12 years, Home Minister Rajnath Singh is a permanent character of Indian politics
 unhen chaah kar bhi koi nahin hilaa sakaa
 Forgot to say that 350 students study in Physics Department
 botni vibhaag main bhi koi teacher nahin he
 Teaching a part-time student, hoping to be full-time
 ajay singh ke zarie ham is mahaan kalege tak pahunch paae, baaki kaam indresh pandey ne kar diya
 After somehow opening the college and seeing the condition of the lab, it became clear that those who sold the churn to make India a world guru have no concern with the gurus or laboratories of India
 agar aap yah samaj rahe hai ki yah dhulakanon ke gunon par shodh karne vaali prayogshaala he to aap galat nahin he
 This laboratory should be named as Abushalaya and an advertisement should be made and shown on TV that without this we can give speech to the youth and take votes from them
 yahaan upkarnon par jo dhul jami he wo darasal yahi kah rahi he ki bharat ke kalejon main sab kuch mit sakati he, magar dhul nahin mit sakati he
 Dust is immortal like a soul
 zarur ziladhikari is sho ke baad principal ko kaaran bataao notice jari karegaa lekin in dhulakanon ko pataa he ki anushaasan unhone nahin todaa he
 She is frozen in silence
 anushaasan prime time ke is ankar ne todaa he jo raajnneeti kii rozaana nautanki ke bich is prayogshaala main camera lekar bhatak rahaa tha
 You will go to this lab alone one night, i am sure that you will be seen making beedis here from Newton to the Galleys
 madam curi or edison kii hansi sunai degi or jagadish bose lekar homi bhabha tak yahaan chand par ug aane vaale ped paudhon ko kavita suna rahe honge
 We cannot get information about whether the tender of beaker and test tube comes out regularly
 balrampur ke kalege kaa haal dikhaane ke baad ek chaatr ne messej kiya, kaha ki aapane yah to bataaya nahin ki prayogshaala main paas karaane ke liye shikshak yaa sahaayak paise lete hai
 They earn a lot
 hamaare paas aisi baton kii jaanch karne ke liye utani badi team nahin he
 To cover the state of India's higher education, two lakh correspondents and twenty thousand correspondents are needed, which we do not have
 bharat ke kalege bharat kii javaaniyon kalejon main aakar kabad ban jaati hai
 By the way, the science in which science is dying
 vahaan shikshakon ke atendence ke liye biometric aa gaya he
 Put a thumb impression, ring it and attend
 is tarah ham is mashin ke zarie nae bharat main pravesh kar jate hai lekin uske baad aapako puraane bharat main hi pahunchnaa hota he
 79 teachers posts are approved for 5000 students but only 31 are there
 31 shikshakon ko dekhakar hi koi gin degaa lekin ham 2022 ke bharat main enter kar rahe hai isliye biometric mashin zaruri he
 Students' union elections are going on in this college
 adhyaksh ke ummidavaar ne bataaya he ki unke adhyaksh banane ke baad sudhaar kiya jayega
 This is the quality of the election, after that everything gets to see the cinema
 jo chunaav ke saath khatm ho jaataa he
 It seems that there is no life left in the zoological department building
 yahaan koi praani nahin aata hoga
 The college building is sick
 aap kebi piji kalege kii imaarat kaa haal dekhte chaliye
 The floor is broken
 peya jal kii vyavastha kaa haal dekhie
 It seems that the students of this college do not feel thirsty
 unhone nal kaa istamaal karnaa 21veen sadi ke shuru hote hi band kar diya he
 When there is no drinking water then why is there a toilet
 kya yah vigyaan kaa koi chamatkaar he yaa phir hamaari barbaadi kaa sanskaar
 There was a lock in a toilet, the woman is near the principal's cabin so they locked it
 prisimple ashavan hai ki sab kuch thik ho jayega
 Check the condition of this toilet of KB College
 kya ummid kii jaae ki grahamantri rajnath singh apane grih zile ke is kalege kaa haal badal denge
 Many reporters are interviewing the same leader daily in the context of Gujarat elections, they should go to colleges in Gujarat
 us kalege main jahaan pradhanmantri padhe hai
 So that a comparison can be made whether Home Minister Rajnath Singh is better at taking care of his colleges or for development or Prime Minister Modi
 is tarah ke swasthy mukaable se raajnneeti bhi behatar hoti he
 The second college in Mirzapur is Kamala Aryakanya Postgraduate Mahavidlaya
 1968 main banakar taiyaar hua
 It is the only women's college in Mirajapur
 baahar se kalege kii imaarat thik thaak hi dikhti he
 About 1200 students in various disciplines have a future here
 hindi kii class kii ladakiyon ne bataaya ki kai dinon se koi padhaane vaala nahin aayaa he to kya karen, gapp shapp hi karenge
 Studies were going on in a class
 hamane ujisi kii guideline dekhi
 The same guideline in which applications have been sought from 20 colleges to become world class universities
 usamen kaha he ki world class banane ke liye 1 shikshak par 20 chaatr hone chahie
 This thing sounded like a dream
 yahaan to ek bhi teacher nahin hai or jahaan ek hai un par 20 nahin,1200 tak chaatr hai
 Before the Lok Sabha elections and after the elections, Prime Minister Modi used to say that India will export teachers
 tab sunakar mujhe bhi laga ki yah bahut acha
 The idea of export of teachers is also new, although in which country imported teachers are waiting
 ho saktaa he aisa koi desh ho magar uniwarsity series ke dauraan yah baat samaj main aa gai he ki bharat ko is vakt shikshakon ke aayaat kii zarurat he
 Colleges in the city are deserted without teachers
 niryaat kii baat baad main karenge
 First, the position of teachers in their colleges should be evaluated according to the new number of students
 26 disambar 2014 ko pradhanmantri ne biechayu main new teacher training skim kii buniyaad rakhte hue kaha tha ki bharat ko taap class shikshakon ke niryaat kaa lakshya rakhana chahie
 He said that the world is looking at us but is not ready
 bharat ke kalege bhi kisi kii taraf dekh rahe honge, unke liye bhi koi taiyaar nahin he
 On 26 December 2014, the Prime Minister laid the foundation of Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya National Mission on Teacher and Training
 900 karod kii yah mahatvakanjhi yojana kaa taaja haal he ki nideshak kii niyukti ho gai he
 BHU has given five acres of land and the tendering process for the building has started here
 pradhanmantri ne jis yojana kaa shubharambh kiya ho uskaa tender bhi shuru hone main teen saal lag jaataa he
 At the moment, the same information has been received
 us vakt pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki shikshakon kii bahut maang hai
 He had said that India's education system is not designed to make robots
 ham parampara aadhaarit shiksha kii samskruti kaa utpaadan karte hai
 The Prime Minister also talked about the export of teachers on the Madison Square
 piemindia kii website par bhaashan maujuud hai
 On September 28, 2014, it was said that by the time of 2020, such a large amount of workcourse will be needed in the world
 inke yahaan sab buudhe buudhe log honge
 The world will not have workmen
 ham puri duniya ko workforce supplai kar sakate hai
 Today there is a demand for teachers in the world
 Maths or Science ke teachers nahin milte hai
 Can India not export these teachers? yahi baat unhone 17 november 2014 ko sidney ke alphons arina main kahi thi
 We had said in Sydney that we export the best quality teacher in the world, we can make the whole world our own
 bharat ke lakhon skulon or hazaron kalejon ko maths, science, history, hindi, sanskrit se lekar tamaam vishyon ke shikshakon kii zarurat he
 Youngsters are getting old waiting for jobs by passing the UGC NET exam
 bied kii degree lekar rose rojgaar samachar ke panne palatate hai
 The idea of exporting is good but it was so good that it did not even realize that the colleges in our neighborhood also need to import teachers
 amravati zila maharashtra kaa ajukeshan hub mana jaataa he kyonki yahaan par ejineering se lekar medical sab hai
 Private as well as government
 hamaare sahyogi sanjay shinde amravati zile ke vadhona ramnath gaanv gaye
 This village is just 45 km from Amravati city
 gaanv kii aabaadi paanch hazaar kii he
 Only the farmers live
 teen chaar kamare main chal rahe is kalege ko dekhakar yakeenan pradhanmantri se kaha ja saktaa he ki teacher ke niryaat se pehle aap is tarah ke kalejon kaa bharat se niryaat kar den
 This college has been running for twelve years
 privet he lekin amravati uniwarsity se manyata praapt he
 There is neither a playground after this, nor a laboratory
 aas paas ke kisaano ke bachche yahaan admician lekar kalege main padhane kaa bharam paalate hai
 Teachers working here for many years get a salary of only 5000 rupees
 neutnam mazaduri se kam, manaregaa ke rate se bhi kam par kaam kar rahe hai
 The official rate is 240 rupees per period
 is hisaab se bhi shikshakon ko kam miltaa he
 Nearly 200 students study here
 yahaan par ek bhi shikshak permanent nahin he
 Colleges in India are warehouses to enslave teachers
 chaatro ko barbaad karne kaa kaarkaana
 Just ten km from the village where the college is located, is the village of Punjab Rao Deshmukh, India's first agriculture minister
 shikshak kehete hai ki paanch hazaar rupee main ham kaise jivan chalaayenge
 Several posts of teachers have been vacant in Amravati Sant Gadge Baba University
 yahaan kii imaarat to acchhee he magar kai vibhaagon main lekturer ke pad khaali hai
 Is a Professor Permanente in Hindi Department
 hindi kii jagah marathi ke professor kii niyukti ho gai he

 The comments professor ke 17 pad mazur hai magar 11 khaali hai
 Assistant Professor has 29 posts, but 11 are vacant
 lekturer ke 65 pad manzur hai magar 11 khaali hai
 The university has sent a proposal to the government that more than 130 teachers are needed, uniwarsity series kaa yah chaudaavaan ank aapako kaisaa laga, ye hamen nahin, apane padosi ko bataaiye, aapas main charchaa kiijie ki karnaa kya he
 Should the factory of waste of time be closed in the name of higher education in India or should the colleges be exported to India along with teachers
 ham chaah len to bekaar pade in kalejon kaa niryaat kar sakate hai
 As we are about to export teachers
 brake le lete hai
 If you are understanding that this is a laboratory to research the properties of dust then you are not wrong
 is prayogshaala kaa naam durupyogshaala rakh dena chahie or vigyaapan banaakar tivi par dikhaanaa chahie ki ham iske bagair bhi yuvaaon ko bhaashan dekar unase vot le sakate hai
 The dust that has accumulated on the equipment here is actually saying that everything can be erased in the colleges of India, but the dust cannot disappear
 dhul aatma kii tarah amar he
 Surely the District Magistrate will issue a show cause notice to the principal after this show, but these dust mills know that they have not broken the discipline
 wo to chupchaap jami hui hai
 Discipline is broken by this prime time anchor who was wandering around the daily gimmick of politics with a camera in this lab
 aap is prayogshaala main kisi raat akele jaaiyegaa, mujhe yakeen he ki newton se lekar galileyon tak yahaan bidi banaate nazar aaenge
 Madame Curie and Edison will be heard laughing, and Jagdish Bose to Homi Bhabha will be reciting poems to the trees growing on the moon here
 hamen isaki jaankaree nahin mil sakati he ki bikar or test tub kaa tender niyamit rup se nikalataa he yaa nahin
 After showing the condition of the college of Balrampur, a student messaged, saying that you did not say that teachers or assistants take money to pass in the lab
 ve kaaphi kama lete hai
 We do not have such a large team to examine such things
 bharat kii ucch shiksha kaa haal cover karne ke liye do lakh samvaadadaata or bees hazaar samvaadadaataaon kii zarurat he jo hamaare paas nahin he
 College of India, jawans of India come to colleges and become junk
 vaise jis kalege main vigyaan dam tod rahaa he
 Biometric has come to attend teachers there
 anguuthe kaa nishaan lagaaiye, tuun taan bajaaiye or atendence ho gaya
 In this way, we enter new India through this machine, but after that you have to reach old India itself
 5000 chaatro ke liye yahaan 79 shikshakon ke pad manzur hai magar hai maatr 31
 Someone will count by looking at 31 teachers, but we are entering India in 2022, so a biometric machine is necessary
 is kalege main chaatr sangh ke chunaav chal rahe hai
 The candidate for president has stated that reforms will take place after he becomes president

 Is it a miracle of science or a sacrament of our ruin
 ek shauchalay main taala laga hua tha, mahila principal ke cabin ke paas he isliye unhone band kar diya
 The principals are hopeful that everything will be alright

 What to expect is that Home Minister Rajnath Singh will change the condition of this college in his home district
 bahut se reporter gujarat chunaav ke sandarbh main ek hi netaa ko rose intervyuu le rahe hai unhen gujarat ke kalejon main janaa chahie
 In the college where the Prime Minister has studied
 taaki tulana kii ja sake ki apane apane kalejon kaa khyaal rakhane main, vikaas karne main grahamantri rajnath singh behatar hai yaa pradhanmantri modi
 Politics is also better than such healthy competition

 On 26 December 2014, the Prime Minister laid the foundation of the New Teacher Training Scheme at BHU and said that India should aim to export top class teachers
 unhone kaha tha ki duniya hamaari taraf dekh rahi he magar taiyaar nahin he

 Amravati district is considered to be the education hub of Maharashtra as it has everything from engineering to medical

 Our colleague Sanjay Shinde went to Wadhona Ramnath village in Amravati district
 amravati shahar se maatr 45 kimi dur he yah gaanv
 The village has a population of five thousand
 kisaan hi rahete hai
 Seeing this college running in three to four rooms, the Prime Minister can certainly be told that before the teacher's export, you should export such colleges from India
 yah kalege baarah saal se chal rahaa he
 Is private but accredited with Amravati University
 na to iske baad khel kaa maidan he, na hi prayogshaala he
 The children of nearby farmers take admission here to study in college

 Nutanam is working at less than the wages, less than the MNREGA rate

 According to this also teachers get less
 200 ke kareeb chaatr yahaan padhate hai
 Not a single teacher is permanent here

 Students ruining factory

 There are many departments that are running on the trust of each professor
 tippaniyan There are 17 posts of professor but 11 are vacant
 assitant professor ke 29 pad hai, magar 11 khaali hai
 The lecturer has 65 posts, but 11 are vacant

 If we wish, we can export these colleges lying idle

 Let's take a break
 hamen isaki jaankaree nahin mil sakati he ki bikar or test tub kaa tender niyamit rup se nikalataa he yaa nahin
 After showing the condition of the college of Balrampur, a student messaged, saying that you did not say that teachers or assistants take money to pass in the lab
 ve kaaphi kama lete hai
 We do not have such a large team to examine such things
 bharat kii ucch shiksha kaa haal cover karne ke liye do lakh samvaadadaata or bees hazaar samvaadadaataaon kii zarurat he jo hamaare paas nahin he
 College of India, jawans of India come to colleges and become junk

 Biometric has come to attend teachers there

 In this way, we enter new India through this machine, but after that you have to reach old India itself
 5000 chaatro ke liye yahaan 79 shikshakon ke pad manzur hai magar hai maatr 31
 Someone will count by looking at 31 teachers, but we are entering India in 2022, so a biometric machine is necessary

 The candidate for president has stated that reforms will take place after he becomes president

 You see the condition of the building of KB PG College

 See the condition of drinking water system
 aisa lagata he ki is kalege ke chaatro ko pyaas hi nahin lagati he
 They have stopped using the tap as early as the 21st century
 jab pani nahin pite hai to phir shauchalay kyon he
 Is it a miracle of science or a sacrament of our ruin
 ek shauchalay main taala laga hua tha, mahila principal ke cabin ke paas he isliye unhone band kar diya
 The principals are hopeful that everything will be alright
 ke bi kalege ke is shauchalay kaa haal dekh lijie
 What to expect is that Home Minister Rajnath Singh will change the condition of this college in his home district
 bahut se reporter gujarat chunaav ke sandarbh main ek hi netaa ko rose intervyuu le rahe hai unhen gujarat ke kalejon main janaa chahie
 In the college where the Prime Minister has studied
 taaki tulana kii ja sake ki apane apane kalejon kaa khyaal rakhane main, vikaas karne main grahamantri rajnath singh behatar hai yaa pradhanmantri modi
 Politics is also better than such healthy competition

 The college building from outside looks just fine

 It seems that the students of this college do not feel thirsty

 When there is no drinking water then why is there a toilet

 Many reporters are interviewing the same leader daily in the context of Gujarat elections, they should go to colleges in Gujarat

 So that a comparison can be made whether Home Minister Rajnath Singh is better at taking care of his colleges or for development or Prime Minister Modi

 This thing sounded like a dream
 yahaan to ek bhi teacher nahin hai or jahaan ek hai un par 20 nahin,1200 tak chaatr hai
 Before the Lok Sabha elections and after the elections, Prime Minister Modi used to say that India will export teachers
 tab sunakar mujhe bhi laga ki yah bahut acha
 The idea of export of teachers is also new, although in which country imported teachers are waiting
 ho saktaa he aisa koi desh ho magar uniwarsity series ke dauraan yah baat samaj main aa gai he ki bharat ko is vakt shikshakon ke aayaat kii zarurat he
 Colleges in the city are deserted without teachers
 niryaat kii baat baad main karenge
 First, the position of teachers in their colleges should be evaluated according to the new number of students
 26 disambar 2014 ko pradhanmantri ne biechayu main new teacher training skim kii buniyaad rakhte hue kaha tha ki bharat ko taap class shikshakon ke niryaat kaa lakshya rakhana chahie
 He said that the world is looking at us but is not ready

 The Prime Minister also talked about the export of teachers on the Madison Square

 Today there is a demand for teachers in the world
 Maths or Science ke teachers nahin milte hai
 Can India not export these teachers? yahi baat unhone 17 november 2014 ko sidney ke alphons arina main kahi thi
 We had said in Sydney that we export the best quality teacher in the world, we can make the whole world our own
 bharat ke lakhon skulon or hazaron kalejon ko maths, science, history, hindi, sanskrit se lekar tamaam vishyon ke shikshakon kii zarurat he

 The idea of exporting is good but it was so good that it did not even realize that the colleges in our neighborhood also need to import teachers

 Teachers working here for many years get a salary of only 5000 rupees
 neutnam mazaduri se kam, manaregaa ke rate se bhi kam par kaam kar rahe hai
 The official rate is 240 rupees per period
 is hisaab se bhi shikshakon ko kam miltaa he
 Nearly 200 students study here
 yahaan par ek bhi shikshak permanent nahin he
 Colleges in India are warehouses to enslave teachers
 chaatro ko barbaad karne kaa kaarkaana
 Just ten km from the village where the college is located, is the village of Punjab Rao Deshmukh, India's first agriculture minister
 shikshak kehete hai ki paanch hazaar rupee main ham kaise jivan chalaayenge

 What to expect is that Home Minister Rajnath Singh will change the condition of this college in his home district
 bahut se reporter gujarat chunaav ke sandarbh main ek hi netaa ko rose intervyuu le rahe hai unhen gujarat ke kalejon main janaa chahie
 In the college where the Prime Minister has studied

 On 26 December 2014, the Prime Minister laid the foundation of the New Teacher Training Scheme at BHU and said that India should aim to export top class teachers
 unhone kaha tha ki duniya hamaari taraf dekh rahi he magar taiyaar nahin he
 Colleges of India will also be looking towards anyone, nobody is ready for them
 26 disambar 2014 ko pradhanmantri ne pandit madan mohan malviya neshnal mishan aan teacher and training kii buniyaad rakhi thi
 It is the latest situation of this important scheme of 900 crores that the Director has been appointed

 He said the same thing on 17 November 2014 at Allphones Arena in Sydney

 The 'no Ball Controversy' stems from the defeat of Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL match played against Mumbai Indians on Thursday
 media reports ke mutabik gussaye viraat kohli ne post match pregentation main match ampire par apana gussa jaahir karne ke baad unke kamare main jaakar bhi apni bhadaas nikaali
 In fact, in this match, Bengaluru needed 7 runs to win on the last ball and the bowler was Lasith Malinga
 malinga ne aakhri gend phenki, sivam dube ne long on par shot khelaa lekin koi bhi ballebaaj ran ke liye nahin dauda
 After this, Mumbai's victory was announced
 haalanki, malinga kii yah aakhri gend no ball thi jis par ampire es
 Ravi did not notice
 riple main dekhne ke baad jab is baat kaa pataa captain kohli ko laga to pehle to unhone ampire ko ankhen khuli rakhane kii salaah di
 After this, going to the umpire's room, he used to use abusive language, abusing them and expressing displeasure
 unhone ampire se kaha, 'agar ampire kii is galati par agar koi karrwai nahin ho sakati he to model code of conduct ke tahat mujh par jurmaana bhi lag jaataa he to mujhe bhi is baat kii parvaah nahin hogi
 Is this the way of umpiring? ”let me tell you that when replays of this ball of Malinga were seen, Malinga's feet were seen out of the crease
 iske baad ampire dwaara yah gend no ball di jaani chahie thi
 If this ball was a no ball, Kohli's team would have got a free hit and AB de Villiers would have been batting dangerously on strike
 wo bada shot lagaakar match main jeet darj kar sakate the
 Explain that de Villiers had played 70 innings during that period
 no ball na dene par nishane par aae ampire ravi isisi kii elite panel main shaamil ekmaatr bhartiya ampire hai
 The board's roster has only 11 umpires for 56 IPL matches
 ampire ke room main jane pehle kohli ne kaha, 'ham ipel ke str par khel rahe hai, yah koi club cricket nahin he
 The umpires should have their eyes open in such matches
 aakhri gend par ampire kaa yah faisla niraashajanak tha
 If i see such a decision, i do not know what is going on

 On this occasion, the Prime Minister has congratulated both the mps by tweeting and said that the country is proud of them

 The Prime Minister also stated the need that more and more 'bidis' should be made in the country under Make in India

 BJP leader Subramanian Swamy said on the occasion that this is an honor of thousands of years old civilization

 The opposition targeted the Prime Minister and said that till date he had done nothing to increase tobacco production
 jabaki kendra main upie kii sarkaar rahete bhale genhu khule main sad jaae, tambaakoo kharaab hone kii khabar kabhi nahin ai
 The Finance Minister has expressed hope that next year his tobacco production in the country will be three times as against 72 crore 50 lakhs

 main vahaan ke akhabaaron main pradhanmantri ke pehle daure or is baar ke daure par chhapi report dekhne laga
 The New York Times and Washington Post then made quite encouraging headlines
 is baar bhi utsaah he magar wo saare sawaal hai jinke bare main ab bhartiya media ne baat karnaa band kar diya he
 It is not that Prime Minister Modi has no relationship with the American media
 pradhanmantri modi ne apane kaarykaal ke do saal puure kiye the to unhone apana ekmaatr intervyuu america ke hi akhbaar wal street jarnal ko diya
 What made the New York Times headlines on the 2014 tour
 New York Times: "defying Expectations in India, Modi begins key trip to US" (september 25) Modi, who has not been granted a visa by the US for a decade as a punishment for the riots, has now come to New York and he is also a popular leader as well as an essential partner, who is China Is able to balance the growing effect
 The Washington Post: Obama's opportunity with India and its new leader (september 28): Nicholas Burns More than anything, Modi wants the United States to invest more in India and increase business so that the Indian economy can be brought on the path which has been registering alarming growth growth in the last 2 years
 New York Times: At Madison Square Garden, Chants, Cheers and Roars for Modi (september 28): Vivian Yee Los Angeles Times: India's prime minister gets rock-star reception in New York (september 28): Steven Zeitchik mul rup se ateet kaa kaam bhavishya kii baaten zyaada thim
 This time the Washington Post and the New York Times have not only questioned Obama and Modi's natural friendship, but have taken a lot of interest in their disputed past
 inhen lekar bhartiya media or raajnneeti ne bhi kareeb kareeb baat hi karnaa band kar diya he
 The Washington Post is in the news Indian PM, once a pariah to US, set to address Congress
 English is not alien, but English means that someone who is not liked
 do saal main chauthi baar pradhanmantri america gaye hai or vahaan ke akhbaar ko ye surkhi lagane kii zarurat kyon mahasoos hui
 On June 4, Matthew Pennington wrote in the first line of his report that the US did not grant visas for many years, but now the Prime Minister of India is being welcomed as a guest
 mujhe washington post kii yah rapat padhate hue hairaani isliye ho rahi thi ki ye sab baaten abhi kyon ho rahi hai
 Why are they happening again akhbaar likhata he ki modi ne muslim virdohi dangon main shaamil rahane ke aaropon ko utaar phenkaa he
 American lawmakers may question him about his human rights record
 bharat or bijepi kaa america par khaasaa focus rahaa he iske baad bhi vahaan kaa ek bada akhbaar sattadhari party kaa naam nahin likhata he balki likhata he ki may 2014 main jabase unki hindu rashtravaadi party satta main ai he tab se unka ye chauthaa daura he
 As chief minister of Gujarat between 2005 and 2013, the US government refrained from making any government contact because it suspected that he had a role in the riots in which thousands of people were killed
 washington post ne unke daure ke mahatv ko nakaara nahin he, un sambhaavnaaon par baat kii he lekin ateet ke pannon ko ulatney kaa kya matlab he
 Is the media there apprehensive about this refreshment in indo-american relations
 bharat ke media main bharat or america ke bich ban rahe in sambandhon ko lekar kaaphi utsaah dikhataa he
 In the New York Times of June 5, Gardiner Harris, while talking about the possibility of the importance of the tour, suddenly writes that 'the two are discussing friendship, but this friendship does not seem natural
 ' Questioning the friendship between Obama and Modi, the New York Times begins to compare the two leaders as to what their image is in the minority community in their respective countries
 neuyork times likhata he ki america ke pehle ashwet raashtrapati baraak obama ne alpsankhyakon ke sangrakshan ko to apana makasad hi bana liya he
 They believe that criticism and unevenness are the soul of democracy
 duusari taraf modi ne apni jidagi kaa bada hissaa sangh ke kaaryakarta ke rup main bitaayaa he
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is a right-wing organization that campaigns for the Hindu majority of India
 modi gujarat ke mukhiya the jab 2002 main dange hue the or un dangon main badi sankhya main musalamaanon kii maut hui thi
 In the past week, 24 people have also been convicted for being involved in a riot
 neuyork times likhata he ki bharat main 14 pratishat musalmaan hai or itane hi africa american america main hai
 Modi's image among India's Muslims has been compared in the newspaper to that of the Southern Segregist, who emerged in the US in the 1950s
 yah dal white yani shwet kii sarvocchata kii baat karata tha magar unheen dashakon main ubhar kar samaapt bhi ho gaya
 i am referring to this why the New York Times is comparing the image of the Prime Minister of India to such an unknown party
 yahaan tak ki neuyork times likhata he ki obama ek achche pati hai
 Is the father
 bacchon ke saath dosti he
 But Modi has no public friendship with anyone and has also left his wife
 neuyork times ne likhaa he ki pradhanmantri modi ne puraane kanoonon kaa istemaal kar asahmati dabaane kaa prayaas kiya or green pis jaise enjio kaa munh band kiya
 These newspapers have taken the opinion of many think tanks in their reports
 jinke bare main varisht patrkaar ashok malik ne twit kiya he ki 'disi main jin logon ko main jaanata hum wo baaki aadhe bache logon kaa intervyuu le rahe hai
 ' congress or sinet kii videsh sambandh cametiyon ke swaagat samaaroh main hissaa lenaa, sansad ko sambodhit karnaa, kya america saansadon, sinetaron or pradhanmantri modi ke liye ek duusare ko kareeb se jaanane kaa mauka nahin milegaa
 When Parliamentarians visited President Clinton in India, Indian lawmakers became restless to join hands with him
 pradhanmantri modi america congress ke netaaon ke saath lunch bhi karne vaale hai
 But everyone will keep an eye on the business deal
 is yatra ke dauraan bharat or america ke bich kai raksha samjhaute ho sakate hai
 The defense deal between the two countries has grown to $ 14 billion
 jet ingine or aircraft karier kii takanic ke vikaas main saajhedaari ho sakati he
 Both the United States and India are concerned about the rise of China
 isliye washington nai dilli se aupchaarik gathjod karnaa chahta he
 The comments bharat or america ke bich newclear deal hui thi to yah uskaa part tha ki america newclear saplir group main bharat ko pravesh dilaane main madad karegaa
 Isn't it time to ask the question of what America did
 jab enesji main civil newclear kopareshan ke bahaane bharat ko vishesh riyaayat mili thi tab raashtrapati jorge bush ne china se baatcheet kii thi
 Will Obama do this? kya aisa karne kii sthiti main wo hai
 China is objecting
 bharat ko 20,000 megawatt ke newclear riector kharidne hai
 In the words of Pallava Bagla, Laddu is very big
 kya america bharat ke saath itane bade hit ko nazarandaaz kar saktaa he
 According to the American media, some companies are eager to invest in India and some are still apprehensive
 america chahta tha ki bharat 2010 kaa libility act badal de lekin purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh or maujuuda pradhanmantri modi donon ne badalane se inkaar kar diya
 Last month, the head of the Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker, said, "expectations in indo-us relations have dragged more than expected
" is daure main kya parmaanu kshetra ke kaarobaar main koi pragati hogi
 Is this visit to be tested on this basis only? bharat ko bhi apane riector bechney hai
 India also has to buy
 france, rus or america is bazaar ko haath se nahin jane dena chahenge
 Now the question is whether America will give India membership of NSG
 badale main bharat kya degaa
 Liberation from the Liability Act of 2010 or something
 - 13 oktober 1949 ko jawahar laal nehru - Rajiv Gandhi on 13 June 1985 - 18 may 1994 ko pi ve narsinha raav - Atal Bihari Vajpayee on 14 September 2000 - 19 july 2005 ko manmohan singh sambodhit kar chuke hai
 i began to see reports in the newspapers of the Prime Minister on his first visit and this time
 neuyork times or washington post ne tab kaaphi utsahvardhak surkhiyaan lagaai thim
 This time too there is excitement but all those questions are about which the Indian media has stopped talking now
 aisa nahin he ki america media se pradhanmantri modi kaa rishta nahin rahaa he
 When Prime Minister Modi had completed two years of his tenure, he gave his only interview to the American Wall Street Journal
 2014 ke daure par neuyork times kii surkhi kya thi
 New York Times: "defying Expectations in India, Modi begins key trip to US" (september 25) dangon ko lekar aarope main sazaa ke taur par jis netaa ko ek dashak tak america ne visa nahin diya, vahi modi ab neuyork aae hai or wo bhi ek lokapriy netaa ke taur par or saath hi ek aavashyak partner ke taur par, jo ki china ke badhate hue prabhaav ko balance karne main sakasham he
 The Washington Post: Obama's opportunity with India and its new leader (september 28): Nicholas Burns kisi bhi or chiz se zyada modi chaahate hai ki america bharat main zyada ye zyada nivesh kare or vyapaar bade jisase bhartiya arthvyavastha raste par laai ja sake jo ki pichley 2 saal main alarming vikaas vruddhi darj kara rahi he
 New York Times: At Madison Square Garden, Chants, Cheers and Roars for Modi (september 28): Vivian Yee Los Angeles Times: India's prime minister gets rock-star reception in New York (september 28): Steven Zeitchik Originally the work of the past was more about the future
 is baar washington post or neuyork times ne na sirf obama or modi kii swaabhaavik dosti par sawaal uthaae hai balki unke vivaadit ateet main kuch zyaada hi dilchaspee lee he
 Indian media and politics have also stopped talking about them
 washington post kii surkhi he Indian PM, once a pariah to US, set to address Congress
 hindi vaala paraayaa nahin, angreji ke paraayaa kaa matlab yah hua ki aisa vyakti jise pasand na kiya jaataa ho
 For the fourth time in two years, the Prime Minister has gone to America and why the newspaper there felt the need to make this headline
 4 june ko mathew pennington ne apni report kii pehali pankti main likhaa he ki kai saal tak america ne visa nahin diya magar ab bharat ke pradhanmantri kaa mehmaan ke rup main swaagat ho rahaa he
 i was surprised to read this report of the Washington Post, why all these things are happening right now
 phir se kyon ho rahi hai
 The newspaper writes that Modi has dropped allegations of involvement in anti-muslim riots
 ho saktaa he ki america saansad unase unke maanavadhikaar record ke bare main sawaal kar den
 India and BJP have had a strong focus on America, but even then a big newspaper does not write the name of the ruling party but it is their fourth visit since their Hindu Nationalist Party came to power in May 2014
 2005 se 2013 ke bich gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke taur par america sarkaar ne unase sarkari sampark banane se bachanaa chaha kyonki use shaq tha ki unki un dangon main bhoomika he jisamen hazaron log marege the
 The Washington Post has not denied the importance of his visit, talked about those possibilities, but what does it mean to reverse the pages of the past
 kya vahaan kaa media bharat america sambandhon main ai is taazgi ko lekar ashankit he
 There is a lot of excitement in the Indian media about these relations being built between India and America
 5 june ke neuyork times main gardinar haris ne is daure ke mahatv kii sambhaavnaaon par baat karte karte achaanak likhane lagate hai ki 'donon kii dosti kii charchaa he magar yah dosti swaabhaavik nahin lagati
 ' neuyark times obama or modi kii dosti ko lekar hi sawaal karte hue donon netaaon kii tulana karne lagata he ki apane apane mulk main alpsankhyak samudaay main inaki chhavi kya he
 The New York Times writes that Barack Obama, America's first black president, has made the preservation of minorities his only objective
 ve maanate hai ki aalochana or asamahati loktantr kii aatma he
 On the other hand, Modi has spent a large part of his life as a Sangh activist
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ek dakshinpanthi sanghathan he jo bharat ke hindu bahusankhyak ke liye abhiyaan chalaata he
 Modi was the chief of Gujarat when there were riots in 2002 and a large number of Muslims died in those riots
 pichley hi hafte ek dange main shaamil hone ke aarope main 24 logon ko sajaa bhi hui he
 The New York Times writes that 14 percent of Muslims are in India and an equal number of African Americans are in America
 bharat ke musalamaanon main modi kii chhavi kii tulana akhbaar main 1950 ke dashak main america main ubhare sadarn segrigesnist se kii gai he
 This party used to talk about white supremacy but it also emerged and ended in the same decades
 main iskaa zikr isliye kar rahaa hum ki neuyork times ek aise agyaat dal se bharat ke pradhanmantri kii chhavi kii tulana kyon kar rahaa he
 Even the New York Times writes that Obama is a good husband
 pita hai

 i began to see reports in the newspapers of the Prime Minister on his first visit and this time
 neuyork times or washington post ne tab kaaphi utsahvardhak surkhiyaan lagaai thim
 This time too there is excitement but all those questions are about which the Indian media has stopped talking now
 aisa nahin he ki america media se pradhanmantri modi kaa rishta nahin rahaa he
 When Prime Minister Modi had completed two years of his tenure, he gave his only interview to the American Wall Street Journal
 2014 ke daure par neuyork times kii surkhi kya thi
 New York Times: "defying Expectations in India, Modi begins key trip to US" (september 25) dangon ko lekar aarope main sazaa ke taur par jis netaa ko ek dashak tak america ne visa nahin diya, vahi modi ab neuyork aae hai or wo bhi ek lokapriy netaa ke taur par or saath hi ek aavashyak partner ke taur par, jo ki china ke badhate hue prabhaav ko balance karne main sakasham he
 The Washington Post: Obama's opportunity with India and its new leader (september 28): Nicholas Burns kisi bhi or chiz se zyada modi chaahate hai ki america bharat main zyada ye zyada nivesh kare or vyapaar bade jisase bhartiya arthvyavastha raste par laai ja sake jo ki pichley 2 saal main alarming vikaas vruddhi darj kara rahi he
 New York Times: At Madison Square Garden, Chants, Cheers and Roars for Modi (september 28): Vivian Yee Los Angeles Times: India's prime minister gets rock-star reception in New York (september 28): Steven Zeitchik Originally the work of the past was more about the future
 is baar washington post or neuyork times ne na sirf obama or modi kii swaabhaavik dosti par sawaal uthaae hai balki unke vivaadit ateet main kuch zyaada hi dilchaspee lee he
 Indian media and politics have also stopped talking about them
 washington post kii surkhi he Indian PM, once a pariah to US, set to address Congress
 hindi vaala paraayaa nahin, angreji ke paraayaa kaa matlab yah hua ki aisa vyakti jise pasand na kiya jaataa ho
 For the fourth time in two years, the Prime Minister has gone to America and why the newspaper there felt the need to make this headline
 4 june ko mathew pennington ne apni report kii pehali pankti main likhaa he ki kai saal tak america ne visa nahin diya magar ab bharat ke pradhanmantri kaa mehmaan ke rup main swaagat ho rahaa he
 i was surprised to read this report of the Washington Post, why all these things are happening right now
 phir se kyon ho rahi hai
 The newspaper writes that Modi has dropped allegations of involvement in anti-muslim riots
 ho saktaa he ki america saansad unase unke maanavadhikaar record ke bare main sawaal kar den
 India and BJP have had a strong focus on America, but even then a big newspaper does not write the name of the ruling party but it is their fourth visit since their Hindu Nationalist Party came to power in May 2014
 2005 se 2013 ke bich gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke taur par america sarkaar ne unase sarkari sampark banane se bachanaa chaha kyonki use shaq tha ki unki un dangon main bhoomika he jisamen hazaron log marege the
 The Washington Post has not denied the importance of his visit, talked about those possibilities, but what does it mean to reverse the pages of the past
 kya vahaan kaa media bharat america sambandhon main ai is taazgi ko lekar ashankit he
 There is a lot of excitement in the Indian media about these relations being built between India and America
 5 june ke neuyork times main gardinar haris ne is daure ke mahatv kii sambhaavnaaon par baat karte karte achaanak likhane lagate hai ki 'donon kii dosti kii charchaa he magar yah dosti swaabhaavik nahin lagati
 ' neuyark times obama or modi kii dosti ko lekar hi sawaal karte hue donon netaaon kii tulana karne lagata he ki apane apane mulk main alpsankhyak samudaay main inaki chhavi kya he
 The New York Times writes that Barack Obama, America's first black president, has made the preservation of minorities his only objective
 ve maanate hai ki aalochana or asamahati loktantr kii aatma he
 On the other hand, Modi has spent a large part of his life as a Sangh activist
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ek dakshinpanthi sanghathan he jo bharat ke hindu bahusankhyak ke liye abhiyaan chalaata he
 Modi was the chief of Gujarat when there were riots in 2002 and a large number of Muslims died in those riots
 pichley hi hafte ek dange main shaamil hone ke aarope main 24 logon ko sajaa bhi hui he
 The New York Times writes that 14 percent of Muslims are in India and an equal number of African Americans are in America
 bharat ke musalamaanon main modi kii chhavi kii tulana akhbaar main 1950 ke dashak main america main ubhare sadarn segrigesnist se kii gai he
 This party used to talk about white supremacy but it also emerged and ended in the same decades
 main iskaa zikr isliye kar rahaa hum ki neuyork times ek aise agyaat dal se bharat ke pradhanmantri kii chhavi kii tulana kyon kar rahaa he

 Modi, who has not been granted a visa by the US for a decade as a punishment for the riots, has now come to New York and he is also a popular leader as well as an essential partner, who is China Is able to balance the growing effect

 In the New York Times of June 5, Gardiner Harris, while talking about the possibility of the importance of the tour, suddenly writes that 'the two are discussing friendship, but this friendship does not seem natural
 ' Questioning the friendship between Obama and Modi, the New York Times begins to compare the two leaders as to what their image is in the minority community in their respective countries

 In the past week, 24 people have also been convicted for being involved in a riot

 Modi's image among India's Muslims has been compared in the newspaper to that of the Southern Segregist, who emerged in the US in the 1950s
 yah dal white yani shwet kii sarvocchata kii baat karata tha magar unheen dashakon main ubhar kar samaapt bhi ho gaya
 i am referring to this why the New York Times is comparing the image of the Prime Minister of India to such an unknown party
 yahaan tak ki neuyork times likhata he ki obama ek achche pati hai
 Is the father
 bacchon ke saath dosti he
 But Modi has no public friendship with anyone and has also left his wife
 neuyork times ne likhaa he ki pradhanmantri modi ne puraane kanoonon kaa istemaal kar asahmati dabaane kaa prayaas kiya or green pis jaise enjio kaa munh band kiya
 These newspapers have taken the opinion of many think tanks in their reports
 jinke bare main varisht patrkaar ashok malik ne twit kiya he ki 'disi main jin logon ko main jaanata hum wo baaki aadhe bache logon kaa intervyuu le rahe hai
 ' congress or sinet kii videsh sambandh cametiyon ke swaagat samaaroh main hissaa lenaa, sansad ko sambodhit karnaa, kya america saansadon, sinetaron or pradhanmantri modi ke liye ek duusare ko kareeb se jaanane kaa mauka nahin milegaa
 When Parliamentarians visited President Clinton in India, Indian lawmakers became restless to join hands with him
 pradhanmantri modi america congress ke netaaon ke saath lunch bhi karne vaale hai
 But everyone will keep an eye on the business deal
 is yatra ke dauraan bharat or america ke bich kai raksha samjhaute ho sakate hai
 The defense deal between the two countries has grown to $ 14 billion
 jet ingine or aircraft karier kii takanic ke vikaas main saajhedaari ho sakati he
 Both the United States and India are concerned about the rise of China
 isliye washington nai dilli se aupchaarik gathjod karnaa chahta he
 The comments bharat or america ke bich newclear deal hui thi to yah uskaa part tha ki america newclear saplir group main bharat ko pravesh dilaane main madad karegaa
 Isn't it time to ask the question of what America did
 jab enesji main civil newclear kopareshan ke bahaane bharat ko vishesh riyaayat mili thi tab raashtrapati jorge bush ne china se baatcheet kii thi
 Will Obama do this? kya aisa karne kii sthiti main wo hai
 China is objecting
 bharat ko 20,000 megawatt ke newclear riector kharidne hai
 In the words of Pallava Bagla, Laddu is very big
 kya america bharat ke saath itane bade hit ko nazarandaaz kar saktaa he
 According to the American media, some companies are eager to invest in India and some are still apprehensive
 america chahta tha ki bharat 2010 kaa libility act badal de lekin purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh or maujuuda pradhanmantri modi donon ne badalane se inkaar kar diya
 Last month, the head of the Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker, said, "expectations in indo-us relations have dragged more than expected
" is daure main kya parmaanu kshetra ke kaarobaar main koi pragati hogi
 Is this visit to be tested on this basis only? bharat ko bhi apane riector bechney hai
 India also has to buy
 france, rus or america is bazaar ko haath se nahin jane dena chahenge
 Now the question is whether America will give India membership of NSG
 badale main bharat kya degaa
 Liberation from the Liability Act of 2010 or something

 Aparajita Sharmine Days Insurance companies are providing health coverage to senior citizens
 unke liye ve yaa to vishesh yojanaayen lekar ai hai yaa saamaanya yojanaon main hi unhone varisht nagarikon ke liye vishesh khubiyaan jodi hai
 There are also specific plans for diabetes and heart patients
 haalanki varisht nagarikon ke plan main kai chetavaniyaan shaamil hoti hai, jo saamaanya swasthya bime main shaamil nahin hotin, masalan, zyada sah-bhugtan, kathor chikitsa pareekshan, kuch khaas suvidhaon kaa na hona or pehle se maujuud bimariyon (piidi) vaale logon ke liye zyada lambii pratiksha avadhi
 In higher premium insurance, the general principle is 'the older the age, the higher the premium'
 swasthya beemaa ke maamle main to yah or bhi sach he, kyonki umr badaae ke saath medical pareshaaniyon kii sambhaavna bhi zyada hoti he
 However, there is a huge difference in premiums for all policies for senior citizens — Religare Health Insurance's Care Senior Policy has an annual premium of Rs 24,645, while Max Bupa Health Insurance's Health Companion Policy charges a premium of Rs 46,040 annually
 yah fark mote taur par ko-pement yaa sah-bhugtan main fark kii vajah se hota he—jitna zyada sah-bhugtan, utana hi kam premium
 Co-payment can reduce the premium
 In a co-payment, the policy holder has to bear a certain percentage of his treatment and the rest of the insurance company pays
 misaal ke taur par star health insurance ke senior citijan red corpet plan main 30 fisadi (pehle se maujuud bimariyon kii sthiti main 50 fisadi) sah-bhugtan kaa anivaary praavdhaan he
 The annual premium for an insured amount of Rs 10 lakh is Rs 26,550
 maan lijie ki 10 saal tak premium chukaane ke baad koi 10 lakh rupye ke bill kaa daawa karata he—to policy ke mutabik 3 lakh rupye (30 fisadi) use khud chukaana hoga, jabaki baaki dhanrashi beemaa company chukaayegi
 Actually, a total of 5 to that insurance holder
 65 lakh rupye chukaane honge—3 lakh rupye sah-bhugtan ke or 2
 65 lakhs of cumulative premium
 iske mukaable maiks boopa health insurance company kii health compainian policy kaa salanaa premium 46,040 rupye he, jisamen kisi sah-bhugtan kii jarurat nahin he
 So if someone claims 10 lakh rupees after 10 years, then he gets a total of 4 as premium
 6 lakh rupye chukaane honge (haalanki isamen beemaa company medical bill kii puri rakam chukaati he)
 So would it be better to avoid co-payment? is not necessarily
 policybazar dot com ke health insurance ke bijness head amit chhabda kehete hai, ''acha to yahi hoga ki aap sah-bhugtan ke bagaiyr samgr plan len, kyonki inamen koi simaaen nahin hotin
 But if you are not eligible due to age or pre-existing diseases, then you can choose a plan with co-payment option
 ''beemaa se judi sharten or simayenchunki varisht nagarikon ko motiyobind, diabetes or ucch raktchaap sareekhee umr se judi bimaariyaan hone kii sambhaavna hoti he, isliye yah dekhnaa jaruri he ki policy aisi bimariyon ko puri tarah cover karti he yaa nahin
 Most plans of senior citizens come with limitations based on diseases
 masalan, star health and ellide insurance ke joint managing diarector dow
 s
 prakaash kehete hai ki 5 lakh rupye kii bimit raashi vaali policiyon par dil se judi bimariyon ke liye daawey kii seemaa takreeban 2
 It is around 5 lakh rupees
 policy kharidne se pehle aisi bimariyon ko dhyaan main rakhana jaruri he
 It can be difficult to get insurance for people with diabetes and heart disease for certain diseases
 haalanki beemaa companiyaan aise graahakon ke liye bhi policy laane kii koshish kar rahi hai
 Anuj Gulati, MD and CEO of Religare Health Insurance, says, "we offer a special plan — care freedom — for diabetes and even insulin-dependent patients
" yahi nahin, hamaara care heart plan un logon ke liye sahi he jinhone angeoplasty yaa stant implant sareekhe cardyak oparation karwaae hai
 The second plan, similar to this, includes the Diabetes Safe Plan of Star Health Insurance with an annual premium of Rs 21,240 and an insured amount of Rs 5 lakh
 apollo munich health insurance kaa energy silver plan salanaa 30,291 rupye ke premium par samaan kawarej muhaiyaa karata he
 It also offers a 'no claim bonus' - a bonus for not claiming it - a 10% increase in the basic sum assured for each claim-free year, which can be up to a maximum of 100%
 premium main sanshodhamb tak 75 kii umr main beemaa lenaa sambhav nahin tha
 Today most plans are targeting people of this age, for example, Religare Health's Care Senior, Care Freedom and Care Heart Plan and HDFC Argo's My: Health Protection Plan come without age restriction
 iardi ne beemaa companiyon ke liye yah anivaary kar diya he ki ve policiyon ko jindagi bhar navinikrut karen
 However, the premium can also be changed every five or a few years
 isiisiaai lombard general insurance ke underrieting, clems, riinsurance or emchuary ke pramukh sanjay datta kehete hai ki kul milakar 65 or usase zyada umr ke logon ke liye premium main har paanch saal main 25 fisadi kii ausat badhotaree ho sakati he
 However, this is not always the case
 star health insurance ke dow
 Prakash says that the company has not increased the premium for senior citizens for the last 12 years
 kuch companiyaan khaas plan kii peshkash karti hai, jinamein premium ek umr par sthir ho jaataa he
 Anurag Rastogi, president of Accident and Health, HDFC Argo General Insurance, says, "my: Health security has a premium after age 71 and after the age of 61 in the My: Health Medicare Super Top Up Policy, as long as the premiums stabilize
 That IRDAI does not allow changes in policy for all ages and classes
 ''kitni jaruri he jaanchvarisht nagarikon ke zyaadaatar health plan main bahut zyada chikitsa jaanch kii jarurat hoti he
 However some companies offer insurance even without such investigation
 religare health or star insurance aisi hi do companiyaan hai
 In the Star's red carpet plan, if the buyer provides certain medical reports, such as the Stress Thellium report, the blood report and the sugar report (after blood and urine, empty stomach and food), then the insurance company gets a 10% discount on the premium
 May also be willing to offer
 varisht nagarikon kii zyaadaatar yojanaayen salanaa health chekup kii bhi peshkash karti hai
 Gulati of Religare Health says, "all our products offer annual health checkups at no additional cost
" inhen varisht nagarikon ke jaruraton ke hisaab se dhaala ja saktaa he
 “policies also come with benefits
 masalan, jarurat padane par doctor kii complementary sulabhta, feet rahane waalon ke liye discount aadi

 On the other hand, the CPI leader Atul Kumar is unaware, stubbornness and the politics of revenge is being started in Uttar Pradesh through sporadicization which is a dangerous sign

 He had challenged Akhilesh Das of BSP in Lucknow seat
 unka makaan (jo asal main puraane congressi netaa kranti kumaar kaa he) ucch suraksha vaale kshetra main padataa he
 Surrounding it is the Chief Minister's office, Yojana Bhawan, the bungalow of Satish Mishra, who has been the shadow of Mayawati and the sprawling headquarters of the BSP, which houses the inspiration along with the statue of Mayawati

 No person can go to that area at night without the knowledge of the police

 There was no one in the house except an elderly woman named Munni (who is close to Rita)
 bheed ne pehle teen gaadiyaan jala deen or phir bangale ko lootakar aag laga di
 Flames were licking everything on the one hand and on the other hand they were watching government security personnel with impunity

 If they had not been there, how would anyone have crossed the security cordon, that too at midnight
 dilli main congressi netaa digvijay singh ne kaha, ''sab kuch uttar pradesh kii mukhyamantri ke ishaare par rajya sarkaar ke sangrakshan main hua he
 The FIR named BSP MLA Bablu Tiwari, who was leading the attack
 '' unka aage kahana tha, ''police ko bataa diya gaya tha kya hone vaala he
 All the senior officers were in the Chief Minister's residence when the incident took place
 
 
 jis tarah mayawati sarkaar kanoon ko apane rajnatik virodhiyon ke daman ke liye istemaal kar rahi he, congress uskaa muqabla karegi
 On the same day, bahuguna-joshi said in a meeting of Mahila Congress in Moradabad that the Mayawati government was trying to satisfy the women who were victims of rape by giving them some money
 unka aarope tha ki pradesh ke police mahanideshak is tarah kii ghatnaon main helicopter se udakar jate hai jis par lakhon ru
 It costs Rs 25,000 to the victim's family
 muaavje main die ja rahe hai
 There was no point if Parbat had reached this limit of decency
 yah rajnatik bayaan tha
 But bahuguna-joshi, who called herself the product of the women's movement, crossed the limits of decency and took the name of Chief Minister Mayawati and said, "if Mayawati's (rape
 
 
 ) ho jaae to unhen ek karod ru
 Compensation will be given
 '' isse maano bhunchal aa gaya
 And then, admitting his mistake, he said that if i have hurt Chief Minister Mayawati, i feel sorry for her
 reeta bahuguna padi alag-thalgapar mayawati or unke samarthakon kii najar main yah paryaapt nahin tha
 In such a situation, bahuguna-joshi was isolated in his own party and the party could not openly support him either in Delhi nor in Lucknow
 unhen usee shaam dilli jate samay gajiabad main giraftaar kar liya gaya or chunki unhone mukhyamantri ke khilaaf muradabad main apshabd istemaal kiye the isliye majhaila thana main anusuchit jati-janajati kanoon ke tahat gaiyr-jamaanti dhaaraon ke alaava bhartiya dand vidhaan kii dhara 153 e (bhadakaau bhaashan dena) or 109 (gaali-galouj vaali bhashaa istemaal karnaa) ke tahat giraftaar kar subah hote hi adaalat main pesh karke 14 dinon ke liye nyaayik hiraasat main jail bhej diya gaya
 Meanwhile, his house was burnt down
 aag kii lapaton ne congressiyon ko itnaa aatankit kar diya ki bamushkil ek darjan kaaryakarta vahaan pahunch sake
 Senior party leader Pramod Tiwari said in astonishment, "how can anyone believe that a Congress leader will speak abusive language
" yah keval aarope he
 "mayawati was also not taken care of by dignity," party spokesperson Akhilesh Pratap Singh said, why is there a ruckus on this
 ''pichley das saal se mayawati or unki party ke log desh ke mahapurushon ke khilaaf apshabd istemaal " "karte rahe hai, unhen apamaanit karte rahe hai
 He never regretted it
 unhen shame nahin ai magar rita ji ne jubaan phisalane par maafee bhi maang lee
 There are no two criteria in politics
 '' bayanon ko chhodkar koi kuch kar na sakaa
 No one from Delhi came to see the condition of bahuguna-joshi's house and some Congressmen sat on a dharna in their burnt house instead of on the streets
 mayawati ke aatank kaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Everyone expected either Sonia Gandhi to say something or Rahul Gandhi
 phir congressi netaa rajbhavan jaakar rajyapal tii
 V
 rajeshwar ko gyaapan de aae
 BSP strongly condemned, Mayawati was furious
 unhone kaha ki bahuguna-joshi ne un par abhadra, ghatiya or ashobhaneey tippanee kii jisaki basapa ninda karti he
 "such remarks were made at the behest of the Congress high command
" traasadee yah he ki mere khilaaf bahuguna-joshi ke apmanjanak bayaan ke baavjood sonia chup raheen, unhone isaki ninda tak nahin kii, unke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kii
 The Chief Minister said that bahuguna-joshi's indecent statement made all BSP workers ready to take to the streets across the country, but keeping law and order in mind, i stopped them
 
 
 bekasoor logon ke jaan-maal kaa nuksaan ho saktaa tha
 Contrary to broken politics, BJP spokesperson Hriday Narayan Dixit says that all is well, bahuguna-joshi has crossed the limits of civilized language, yet a case is not made against him under the Scheduled caste-tribe Act because he did not humiliate the caste
 phir ve yaad dilaate hai ki janvari 2007 main mayawati ne ek sabha main kaha tha, ''yadi muslim mahila ke saath balaatkaar kii keemat 2 lakh ru
 If you do not have a daughter (of Mulayam Singh Yadav), then your brother-nephew will have a sister-daughter, rape her and the Muslim society will give them Rs 4-4 lakh
 muaavje main de degaa
 "dixit raises the question that which language was it? Actually, according to him, (mayawati and Congress) ideals and paradigms of democratic politics are being broken from both sides
 aalochakon ko nahin bakhshatin mayamayawati kabhi apane aalochakon ko bakhshati nahin
 His dictatorship has its own democratic style
 logon ko yaad he ki pichley saal 31 march ko jab bhartiya kisaan union ke netaa mahendra singh tikait ne, jinase centre bhi darataa he, jab bijanour main mayawati ke khilaaf jativaadee tippanee kii thi to na sirf mujffarnagar main danga bhadak uthaa tha balki police ne is tarah unke khilaaf hallaa bolaa tha ki puraa kshetra kaanp uthaa or aakhir unhen aatm-samarpan karnaa padaa tha
 State SP President Akhilesh Yadav has alleged that Uttar Pradesh has now turned into a 'police Raj'
 ''sapa ke samarthakon ko yaa to gangster act ke tahat jail bheja jaataa he yaa ilaaka badar kar diya jaataa he
 In support of this, he gives the example of his constituency Kannauj
 teen block pramukhon ko isliye jila badar kar diya gaya kyonki basapa vahaan loksabhaa chunaav haar gai thi
 Apart from this, under the same police station, 12 of his young supporters were changed
 kareeb 1200 logon par gunda act ke tahat maamle banaae gaye jabaki 800 ko jila badar kiya gaya he
 The Thakurs were also repressed, people also remember that the police imposed a gangster act on whoever saw Mayawati tearing up posters or setting them on fire
 haal hi main kiran jatav naamak ladki meerut se lakhanu mukhyamantri se milane ai
 The police did not let him meet
 jab vah vidhaan bhawan ke saamne mayawati ke poster ko chhu rahi thi to use police ne dhar-dabocha
 In the previous government, many (thakur) leaders, who are considered as Surma in their caste-society, were so oppressed that even today their tongue starts shivering when they speak something against Mayawati
 pradesh ke logon main failaa bhayis ghatana ke baad rajya bhar main log dare hue hai, or lagata he ab mayawati or centre sarkaar ke bich takaraav badhegaa
 Anyway, Mayawati is restless after the setback in the elections and is always in a mood to confront the central government
 vajahah unhen lagata he ki congress, sonia or rahul ke kaaran daliton kaa ek varg, musalmaan or brahman congress kii ore jhuk gaye jisase basapa 21 kaa aankada nahin paar kar saki jabaki congress rajya main hi 21 siten laakar dilli kii ore badhate unke raste main khadi ho gai
 Then the way the graph of the Congress is increasing and the way the SP is in the mood for a fight, it could pose a threat to them in the coming assembly elections
 kai masalon par basapa main bechainidusri ore, sibiai dwaara aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main aarope patr daakhil karne kii taiyaari or lakhanu or noida ko apni murtiyon ke shahar main badalane kii koshish main rukaawat, kanoon-vyavastha or vikashinata par congress, sapa or bhaajapa dwaara hamalaa or naukarshahi ke bheetar ek varg main bechaini unhen baichaiyn kar rahi he
 Congress national spokesperson Manish Tiwari said, "uttar Pradesh is completely jungle secret
" apane khilaaf chal rahe kanoonee maamalon ke kaaran mukhyamantri kii hataasha baahar aa rahi he
 The agitation in Amethi on the issue of electricity became a development issue for the Congress when the police lathi-charged the agitators in Amethi over the supply of electricity
 congress pehle se naaraaz thi ki mayawati in kshetron se sautela vyavhaar kar rahi hai or us par bijli maangane waalon par lathicharge se mayawati or centre ke bich kii raajnneeti garma gai
 When the news of Rahul's arrival spread, the Chief Minister transferred the Superintendent of Police of Sultanpur and ordered the SHO to appear on the line
 saath hi piesi kii unit ko bhi amethi se hatane kaa aadesh diya
 The Chief Minister also announced, "no person, whether associated with a political party or a government employee, will be allowed to take the law into his own hands and be strictly dealt with by such elements
 basapa ne congress par lagaae aropunki bijli ke naam par raajnneeti hone lagi to mayawati ne kaha, ''main kanoon-vyavastha main khalal daalane waalon ke khilaaf karrwai karne main nahin hichakungi'' kyonki bijli kii mushkilon ke liye congress shashan hi doshi he
 But now the arrest of bahuguna-joshi and the burning of his house "under government supervision" led to the statewide agitation for the first time and all the opposition parties demanded the sacking of the 'dictator' Mayawati government
 congress ne bhi rajyavyapee anishchit kaaleen andolan kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Mayawati is also in a mood for war
 congress pehle se mauka khoj rahi he
 Therefore there will be war
 magar iskaa rang kya hoga, anjaam kya hoga iske liye sabaki najar sonia gandhi par he
 Poisonous Bol - In the midnight of July 15-16, 2009, the person whose face was seen behind the mask leading the crowd was identified as BSP MLA Jitendra Singh Bablu
 kehete hai, zyaadaatar nakaabposh uttar pradesh police ke sipaahi the
 - It is alleged that a favorite senior police officer of Mayawati herself made several rounds of the area to see if the crowd was functioning properly

 Security forces watch over the watch tower of Raj Bhavan

 -the change of such violent politics started on May 2, 1995 by Mulayam Singh Yadav's supporters with a deadly attack on Mayawati at the State Guest House when Mayawati withdrew support from the Mulayam government
 -15 july, 2009 ko rita bahuguna joshih jahaan kahin kisi dalit mahila se balaatkaar hota he, police mahanideshak helicopter se jate hai jis par lakh-do-lakh kharch hote hai, par peedit parivaar ko 25,000 ru
 Compensation is given which is extremely embarrassing
 yadi mayawati kaa (rape
 
 
 
 ) ho jaae to use ek karod ru
 Compensation will be given -bhaajapa pravaktaa hriday narayan dikshit yaad dilaate hai ki janvari, 2007 main mayawati ne ek sabha main kaha thah yadi muslim mahila ke saath balaatkaar kii keemat 2 lakh ru
 If you do not have a daughter (of Mulayam Singh Yadav) then rape your brother-nephew's sister-daughter and the Muslim society gives them Rs

 Rita bahuguna-joshi: i regret if Mayawati has been hurt by my statement
 saath hi yah bhi maang karti hum ki mahilaon kii hatya or balaatkaar ko thode-se dhan se taulne ke sharmnaak kaary ke liye mayawati swayan bhi khed vyakt karen
 Mayawati: The SC-ST Act was made by the Congress government at the Center and the compensation amount was also decided by the Congress itself
 usee ne (mahilaon kii) izzat kii keemat tay kii thi
 Mayawati: The incident of arson is shameful, but it should not be associated with the BSP
 yah kaam congress ne bahuguna-joshi ke bayaan se logon kaa dhyaan hataane ke liye kiya he
 In recent days, the police imposed a gangster act on whoever saw Mayawati tearing up the poster
 haal hi main meerut se lakhanu mukhyamantri se milane ai kiran jatav jab vidhaan bhawan ke saamne mayawati kaa poster chhu rahi thi, police ne use dhar-dabocha
 March 31, 2008: Not only did the riot erupt in Muzaffarnagar when peasant leader Mahendra Singh Tikait made racist remarks against Mayawati in Bijnor, but the police laid siege to him that he had to surrender
 -pradesh sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav kaa aarope he ki rajya ab 'police raaj' main badal chukaa he jahaan sapa samarthakon ko gangster act ke tahat jail bheja jaataa he

 sarkaar desh main rojgaar ke behatar or sateek aankade hasil karne ke liye kai tarah kii jugat kar rahi he
 As part of this effort, it is now planned to bring in a system to monitor people changing jobs so that the overall picture of employment can be revealed
 rojgaar ke morche par vipaksh ke hamalon kaa saamana kar rahi sarkaar ke liye aise kadam uthaane jaruri ho gaye hai
 According to the English newspaper Economic Times, currently the data released by the Employees Provident Fund (EPFO) for employment every month shows the number of newly created subscribers, people leaving or changing jobs or re-joining after gaps in employment
 Is included
 lekin naukari chhodane yaa phir se jwine karne main deree karne waalon ke aankadon ko bharosemand nahin mana jaataa
 The system of coming back and preparing the data of the jobbers is not very good
 nae system ke baad zyada majboot aankade aa sakenge
 After this, pure employment numbers will be released
 gauratlab he ki april 2018 se har maheene rojgaar kaa aankada jari kiya ja rahaa he or isamen sitambar, 2017 tak ke aankade liye gaye hai
 There are many flaws in this system due to which it is not possible to get a clear picture of how many new jobs were created in the economy
 isaki vajah yah he ki sirf aise form provident fund ke daayre main aate hai, jinamein 20 yaa usase zyada karmchaaree hote hai
 In this way, employees working in many micro, small and medium enterprises are left out of the purview of data
 iske alaava, ipiefo ke daayre main shaamil karnaa un karmchaariyon ke liye bhi anivaary nahin he, jinaki selary 15,000 rupee maheenaa he
 One of the reasons for the increase in the number of people joining the EPFO could be that after demonetisation and adoption of GST, the formalization of the economy has increased and it may be that some of the increased figures of employment are visible because of informal jobs
 Has been converted into formal jobs
 naveenatam aankadon se yah pataa chalata he ki janvari maheenon main ipiefo ke sabsakribar kii sankhya 17 maheene ke ucchtam str 8,96,000 tak pahunch gai he
 Significantly, on the employment front, the government is constantly facing the attack of the opposition
 tamaam media report main bhi yah daawa kiya gaya ki pichley vitt varsh main berogari dar 45 saal ke record str par pahunch gai he
 Although the government side says that employment is not just the data of jobs, the beneficiaries of the Mudra scheme will also have to be included in the employment figures
 reliance power ke chairman anil ambani ne kaha ki bijli kii shulk daren eendhan keemton ko pratibimbit karne vaali hon taaki yah sunishchit ho ki bijli utpaadak va vitaran companiyaan is udyog main bani rahen
 Ambani, while addressing the annual general meeting of the company, said that electricity tariff rates should increase, reflecting the reality of fuel prices
 agar bijli kshetra ko swasth banaae rakhana he to yah jaruri he ki utpaadan companiyon ko unki daron kaa bhugtan sunishchit ho
 Stressing on a clear and clear strategy to deal with the challenges of the power sector, he said that the sector faces many problems including fuel shortage, water availability
 ambani ne company kii salanaa aam baithak ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, eendhan keemton kii vaastaviktaa ko pratibimbit karte hue bijli shulk daron main vruddhi honi chahie
 If the power sector is to be kept healthy, it is necessary that the production companies are assured of their rates

 ' Only women play Holi in Kundra village of Hamirpur district of Uttar Pradesh's Bundulkhand region

 It seems like it is Diwali, not Holi
 vahiin gaanv keemhilaayeinis din puri tarah aaazaad rahati hai
 364 days of the year, women who live in the veil in front of the elders of the village, do not veil anyone on the day of Holi
 gaanv ke log bataate hai ki holi ke din gaanv ke hi ramjanaki mandir main puure gaanv kii mahilaayein ekatra hoti hai or phag gane ke baad dhoomdhaam se holi khelti hai
 What is the reason for this tradition, Dilawar Singh, Ramdin Meshram and Vivek Thakur told that many decades ago on the very day of Holi, the people of the village were singing in the Ramjanaki temple, when a prize dacoit member, Member Singh, killed Rajgal Pal by killing him
 Was given is ghatana ke baad is gaanv main kai varshon tak holi nahin manaai gai
 The women took the initiative for a few years, then the women kept quiet, then they tried to convince the men and when they did not agree, all the women of the village gathered in the same Ram Janaki temple and decided that all the women of the village on the day of Holi, performed the ritual We will celebrate the festival together
 isamen purushon kii koi bhagidaar nahin rahegi
 Since then, only women play Holi in the village
 is baat ko kaaphi samay guzar chukaa he, lekin yah shaayad ekmaatr anoothaa gaanv he, jahaan sirf nari shakti hi holi khilne kaa anand leti hai

 samaajawaadee party main chal rahaa dangal aadhunik yug kaa mahabharat he jisamen rishton or raajnneeti kii ladaai he
 Just as the efforts for peace in the Mahabharata of Dwapar era had failed, similarly the same has happened here
 chunaav ayog main donon senaayen aamane-saamne hai, jahaan donon ke apane arjuna or krishna hai or donon hi apane arjunon se kah rahe hai ki utho parth or gandiv sanbhaalon, rishte hi nahin raajnneeti ahm hai
 In this Mahabharata too, the importance and importance of relationships and politics is dominated
 haalanki donon senaaon ke paidal sainikon ko abhi pataa nahin he ki unkesenapatikahan par vyuh banaaenge? sabhi ahm or vaham main hai ki akraman kaa aadesh roak diya jayega or bhishma pitamah sanyukt sena ke senapati honge or arjuna ko cycle de di jayega, matlab paanch gaanv pandavon ko milenge
 Shakunis and shikhandis have been identified in the Mahabharata, but they are also tools of self-defense, which is why both sides are not willing to leave them
 lekin ab paijal sainik bhi pahchaan rahe hai ki tir idhar se chale yaa udhar se nuksaan unheen kaa he, jaisaa ki kahawat he sandon kii ladaai main jhaadiyon kaa hi nuksaan hota he

 Any Prime Minister should be allowed to form a team according to his own
 puri tarah se yah unke vivek par nibharr karata he ki kis vyakti ko ve kis kaam ke yogya samajhen
 Even no one should object to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Principal Secretary and the opposition stated this clearly in its response
 agar yah siddhant rup main sahi baat he to phir pradhanmantri ko apni pasand ke pradhan sachiv rakhane main jo kuch bhi karnaa pade vah kyon na karne diya jaae? par yah bhi dhyaan main rakhana chahie ki satta ke sheersh par baithe zimmedaar log apane har faisle se ek paripati bhi kaayam karte hai, jo sabake liye samaan rup se lagu ho
 Has such practice been made in the case of Principal Secretary Nripendra Mishra? nripendra mishra kii kaabiliyat kii daad sab dete hai
 The Uttar Pradesh from which he started his visit to IS will find many people speaking in praise of his administrative ability
 apni isi saakh kii vajah se nripendra mishra har sarkaar main zimmedaar padon par rahe hai
 From Chief Secretary of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Kalyan Singh, he has also worked in the Union Ministry of Finance
 saal 2006 se lekar 2009 tak telecom regularetary athurity of india yani tri ke adhyaksh rahe hai
 There are also important witnesses in the 2G scam case, when n Rajendra Mishra was the chairman when A
 Raja started the disputed policy of first come, first serve as telecom minister
 e raja ne kaha tha ki pehle aao pehle paao kii niti kii salaah tri ne di thi
 But Nripendra Mishra had said that this is a wrong thing and he has always been talking about getting licenses through auction
 inhen ke kyrkaal main thri ji spectrum kii keemten nirdhaarit hui thim
 He has been a 1967 batch IAS officer and has already retired before becoming TRAI chairman
 tri ek niamak sanstha he, jo telecom companiyon or sarkaar ke bich regulator kaa kaam karti he
 Its president should remain independent and not come under any temptation, so a person retiring from this post cannot take any position in the Central or State Government
 lekin 26 may ko pradhanmantri pad kii shapath lene ke do din baad 28 may ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne adhyadesh jari kar nripendra mishra ko apana pradhan sachiv niyukt kar diya
 Mishra could not take any post after retiring from the post of chairman of TRAI
 usee niyam ko badalane ke liye pehle adhyadesh jari hua phir aaj kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne loksabhaa main ek bill pesh kiya or kaha ki yah faisla merit par liya gaya he
 The new bill states that a person retiring from the post of TRAI will not take any position in a government or telecom company for two years
 pehle niyam tha ki ritair hone ke baad kabhi bhi pad nahin le saktaa, lekin ab do saal ke baad le saktaa he
 You know that Nripendra Mishra retired in 2009
 do saal se zyada biit chukaa he
 The opposition says that the post of chairman of Telecom Regulatory Authority is very sensitive
 isi tarah kii vyavastha kendriya satarkta ayog kanoon main bhi he
 Even the head of the largest agency to monitor corruption cannot take any government post after retiring
 kal koi sarkaar sivisi ke chairman pad se ritair hue vyakti ke liye bhi nayaa kanoon laa sakati he or pad saunp sakati he
 The shield to keep the person in these positions away from any kind of temptation can be exhausted
 isliye rajyasabha se lekar loksabhaa tak main vipaksh ke kai netaaon ne sawaal kiya ki ek adhikari ke liye adhyadesh or phir kanoon kyon banaaya ja rahaa he? Now i will try to understand from my guests that whether there was a dispute of Sonia Gandhi's Office of Profit during the UPA period is parallel to it or not
 is vivaad kaa saal tha 2006
 It included an ordinance to protect many mps from the Office of Profit
 inamen sonia gandhi or somnath chatarji bhi the
 All the posts acquired by him in the ordinance were excluded from the purview of the Office of Profit
 isi tarah ke maamle main jaya bachchan kii sadsyta samaapt ho gai thi
 At the same time, in 2013, the case of Office of Profit was also made on Uttarakhand Congress Government Minister Harak Singh Rawat
 rajya sarkaar ne adhyadesh ke zariye kai padon ko offis of proffit se baahar kar diya tha
 At the same time, BJP demanded that Rawat's assembly membership be canceled
 satta main aane ke baad se pradhanmantri lagaataar apni naukarshahi ko peshewar or behatar rup dene kii pahal or vakaalat karte rahe hai
 They have been encouraged to work fearlessly and share ideas
 isi kram main jab upie sarkaar ke samay tainaat adhikariyon ko kuch mantriyon ne apane daftar main niyukt karnaa chaha, to piemo ne roak laga di
 This scale created quite a stir when Modi blocked the file of private secretary to his party president and Home Minister Rajnath Singh
 is tarah ke jatke kai varisht mantriyon ko bhi lage, lekin acchhee baat rahi ki kisi bhi mantri ne virodh nahin kiya
 Everyone agreed towards building a professional team
 magar akhabaaron main aisa likhaa gaya ki nripendra mishra bhi to manmohan singh ke kyrkaal ke samay tri ke chairman bane the
 In the same way, Modi appointed another Manmohan government official as his personal secretary
 manmohan sarkaar ke kaarykaal main niyukt hue cabinet sachiv ajit seth ko chah maheene or piemo main sachiv rahe aar ramanujam ko bhi teen maheene kaa seva vistaar diya gaya
 Public notice of appointment of an officer in PMO is issued and canceled the next day
 mantriyon ke maatahat kaam karne vaale adhikariyon kaa paimaana kya hoga yah piemo tay karata he, magar khud piem apane liye gujarat kader se adhikari le aate hai
 It should be kept in mind that when the Prime Minister cannot make his team, then who can make it? 17 saal tak tiarai kaa yah kanoon endie se lekar upie kii do sarkaron tak jari rahaa
 No one understood the need to change this provision
 kya vipaksh sahi sawaal uthaa rahaa he ki ek adhikari ke liye kanoon banaaya ja rahaa he
 An autonomous body like TRAI is being manipulated, whose autonomous role was seen quite a lot in the 2G case
 yah bill modi sarkaar kaa sadan ke bheetar shakti pareekshan kaa pehla imtahaan bhi he
 The BJP or NDA does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha, it will be difficult to say right now that the government will not be able to muster, but in any case on 14 August this bill will have to be passed
 bhartiya team ne pichley kuch samay se twanti-20 cricket nahin khelaa he, lekin iske baavjood team isisi tii-20 team ranking main apana doosraa sthaan barkaraar rakhane main safal rahi he
 Both India and third-placed South Africa have 123 points, but Team India's position is better when calculated to decimal points
 srilanka kii team 129 ank ke saath sheersh par chal rahi he
 The rankings may however change before the ICC World T20 Championships in Bangladesh from 16 March to 6 April, as four of the top eight teams will take part in six matches in the next fortnight
 tisare number kii dakshin africa 9 march se chathe sthaan par chal rahe australia (110) ke khilaaf teen maichon kii shrunkhlaa khelegi, jabaki isisi vishwa tii-20, 2012 champion or paanchaven sthaan par chal rahe west indies (111) kaa saamana 9 march se hi 2010 ke champion or aathven sthaan par chal rahe england (105) se hoga
 There is a difference of only eight rating points between the top four teams and hence if all of South Africa, Australia and England series are successful in winning the matches, then their ranking can improve
 pakistan 121 ank ke saath chauthe sthaan par he
 If South Africa wins all the matches against Australia, they will have a chance to finish second
 duusari taraf, agar west indies teen maichon kii shrunkhlaa 3-0 se jeet letaa he, to vah or england shrunkhlaa purv kii ranking par barkaraar rahenge
 Australia will have a chance to finish fourth, while England will have to finish sixth

 soochna vibhaag ne ek bayaan main bataaya ki yah ghatana serua praant ke ratu letianara college main ghati
 Details about the sacked teacher have not been disclosed
 shiksha mantri mahendra reddy ne is ghatana ko asweekaarya or chaatro ke sammaan ke adhikaar kaa ulanghan bataaya he
 Reddy said he wants to make it clear to all Fiji teachers that they need to develop high standards of professional conduct
 unhone kaha, 'haalanki, kaksha kaa vaataavaran kai baar chunauteepurn hota he, lekin shikshak, naagarik seva ke mulyon or aacharan ke saamaanya maanakon kaa ulanghan karne ke liye ise bahaanaa nahin bana sakate

 yogi adityanath uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri hai or hindutv ke chehre bhi
 But this face of Hindutva and the CM of the state has lost badly in the by-elections of their own seat Gorakhpur
 gorakhpur se bhaajapa pratyaashee kii haar ke saath-saath phulpur main upmukhyamantri keshav prasad maury bhi bhaajapa kii izzat nahin bachaa sake
 Addressing the press after this major defeat, Yogi had said that the BJP lost due to overconfidence
 mana ja rahaa tha ki yah yogi sarkaar or bhaajapa ke liye ek sikh he or yahaan se bhaajapa kii haar kaa silsilaa tham jayega
 Tabassum's entry into the Lok Sabha will end the historic 'sunapan' of the House, but the defeat in Nurpur and Kairana has once again raised questions on Yogi's leadership and politics
 kairana ke liye to kaha ja rahaa he ki yogi kaa ek bhaashan vahaan bhaajapa ko le duba
 The Jat vote was the most important for the bjp's victory in Kairana
 jaaton ne pichley loksabhaa chunaav or vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa kaa saath dekar ise sabit bhi kiya tha
 But when Yogi came to Kairana to campaign for the by-election, he said something that made the Jat vote against the BJP
 darasal areldi ke jat netaa ajit singh ne is chunaav main puri takat jhonk rakhi thi kyonki yah unke varchasv kii ladaai ban gaya tha
 The candidate of the opposition for the election was also given by RLD
 lekin jat asamanjas main the ki wo ajit singh kaa saath den yaa bhaajapa ke saath bane rahen
 The BJP also played a trumpet case against the Jats in the Muzaffarnagar riots
 isse jaaton main musalamaanon ke khilaaf vot dene or bhaajapa ke saath khadey hone kii gunjaaish bhi banati nazar ai
 Yogi's mistake, but while addressing his last rally in Shamli, Yogi Adityanath made a mistake which the BJP had to pay to lose
 yogi ne is raily ko sambodhit karte hue kaha- ‘‘baap-betaa (ajit singh or jayant) aaj voton ke liye gali-gali bheekh maang rahe hai’’
 The people of the community did not like such words about a Jat leader from the mouth of a non-jat
 unhen laga ki baahar kaa ek aadmi unke ghar main unke apane bhai or bete kaa itnaa apmaan karke kaise ja saktaa he
 The Jat fraternity is known for its sentimentality and attitude
 yogi kii yah baat kai logon ko chubh gai
 If a Jat leader had said this on behalf of the BJP, the Jats might not have felt so bad
 lekin yogi kaa aisa kahana raturaat aag kii tarah jaaton ke bich failaa or jat unhen sabak sikhaane ke liye lamaband ho gaye
 This mistake of Yogi became the turning point of Kairana election
 sanad rahe ki areldi ummidavaar tabassum hasan ke bahaane choudhary ajit singh ne apane siyaasi vajood ko bachaane ke liye is chunaav main din raat ek kar diya tha
 Going from house to house of the Jat community, Ajit Singh and his son Jayant Singh sought votes for Tabassum
 unhone jaaton ko baar-baar yaad dilaayaa ki yah birdari kii asmita or sammaan kaa prashn he
 Yogi's statement to Ajit Singh about these things made ghee in the fire and the result is in front of you

 Ranjitakalakara: Rajinikanth, Radhika Apte and Dhatishkappal: a specialty of Indian cinema that has emerged over the last two decades is the person worship
 bollywood main chaahe khan ho yaa dakshin ke bade naam, ek samay aisa aata he jab vishay, kahani or treetment sab peeche chhot jaataa he, or ek shakhsiyat kala par haaavee ho jaati he
 Then there is also a long history of this person worship in South
 bollywood main actor ke kairactor se bade hone kii jhalak 'sultan' ke saath mil chuki thi or is hafte rajnikant kii 'kabali' ke saath is baat kaa saaf ishaara mil jaataa he ki hamaare liye vyakti kitne myne rakhte hai
 Bathing posters with milk, worshiping and not knowing what? Rajinikanthka has been successful in turning the 'kabali' height into a noise
 jabarajnikantase judi hip ke saath cinemaghar main kadam rakhaa jaataa he to dil main aisa ehsaas rahata he ki na jane parde par kya dekhne ko mili? ummiden bahut zyada hoti hai
 Perhaps 'kochadeyaan' and 'linga' had a slight setback to these expectations
 ab 'kabali' ke saath rajnikant ne kaaphi ummiden jagaain lekin kahani ke morche par film bahut hi saamaanya he or film puri tarah se unke karishme par hi tiki he
 How powerful in the story is the story of Rajinikantaki, who spends a long time in jail, loses his family and pays the price of helping others
 kahani desh-videsh main set he or maamla kamajoro ke liye aawaaj buland karne kaa he
 Exactly like 'shivaji' and 'linga'
 lekin is baar anderworld kii prishthbhumi he
 There is nothing new in the story
 jab-jab rajnikant aate hai to majaa aata he kyonki unka style mjedaar lagata he, kahani rengti hui chalati he or jab baat kabali ke parivaar kii aati he to film haankene-si lagati he
 Overall, there is no newness in the story, anyway Rajinikanth has done so much in his films, now it is a challenge for the director as to what else to do in the film
 star apiugar 'sultan' pichley dinon sirf 'sultan' salmaan khan ke liye dekhi gai thi to aisa hi 'kabali' ke bare main bhi he
 The entire film rests on the charisma of just one man Rajinikanth
 unka entry karnaa, unka andaaj, unki fite, or har vah baat majaa dilaati he jisane ek bas conductor ko aaj itnaa bada sitara bana diya he
 But 65-year-old Tailava has come with great effort in 'kabali', but the signs of age are visible
 iskaa asar ,ection ke dauraan unke riflactions par bhi padataa he
 Radhika Apte is normal in the film, if there is any other actress in her place, it does not matter much
 iske alaava baaki sab thik hai
 There are some stars who are lucky in the case of kamai
 aise hi rajnikant bhi hai
 Both of his previous films may not have been able to do a lot of charisma but were also not in loss
 ab 'kabali' ke bare main to kaha ja rahaa he ki 160 karod ru
 The film made from a budget of Rs 200 crores
 pehle hi kama chuki he
 But of course the cinemas are the real criterion of the film that they will earn before release
 vaise film ke advance booking solid he or ab dekhnaa yah he ki rajnikant film ko kin recodrs tak lekar jate hai
 'kabali' is one time watch
 film paanch se zyada bhashaaon main relies hui he
 The number of shows on a single day of the film has also reached six
 film jo bhi nattejey degi, ve aane vaale samay main 'bahubali-2' kii kasuti par anke jaaenge

 ) dilli sarkaar ke daavon ke mutabik sarkari aspataalon main har marz kii dawa free milegi or marijon kii jaanch bhi muft main hi hogi
 But it seems difficult to implement this scheme in Delhi government hospitals in the initial days
 kahin dawaaiyon ke liye lambii kataren, to kahin staff kii kami se aspataal jujh rahe hai
 Long queues are waiting at the dispensary counter waiting for free medicine
 lekin jis windo se formacist dawa dekar marijon kaa dard kam karata he uske daravaaje hi band he
 Where the windows are open, the long queues of patients are telling the story of the plight of hospitals
 sirf dawaaon ke liye nahin balki blad test jaise ek saadhaaran si jaanch ke liye bhi marijon ko ghanto intjaar karnaa padataa he
 Trying to improve the poor condition of government hospitals in Delhi, the Delhi government announced that from February 1, all the medicines will be available free in government hospitals
 lekin sarkaar ke daavon ke ulat sarkari aspataal puri tarah is yojana ke liye taiyaar nahin dikhaai de rahe hai
 The government's compulsory medicines list includes about 700 medicines
 jo sarkari aspataalon main aane vaale marijon ko muft di jaani hai
 But the list of the folk hero Jai Prakash Hospital of Old Delhi is showing that many medicines are still not present in the hospital dispensary
 kuch aisa hi haal purvi dilli ke guru teg bahadur aspataal kaa he
 To say that there are 10 counters in the drug delivery center, but 3 out of 10 counters are closed due to lack of staff
 lihaaja dawa kaa intjaar marijon or timaradaaron kaa dard badha rahaa he
 However, in terms of availability of medicines, the condition of Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital in East Delhi looked better than LNJP and GTB
 aspataal prashasan kii maane to sarkaar kii yojana ko amal main laane kii kavayad shuru ho chuki he
 According to the Delhi government, 24 hours of free medicine will be available in five major government hospitals of the capital in the next four months
 ab sawaal ye he ki jo aspataal pehle hi doctoron or staff kii kami se jujh rahe hai
 It is a big challenge for the Delhi government to make every merge medicine available 24 hours
 ye hai sarkari aspataal kii kharaab haalat kii vajahadilli sarkaar swasthya sevaaon ko sudhaarney ke liye yojana ke mutabik sarkari aspataalon me badhate marijon ke dabaav ko kam karne ke liye mohalla clinics, poli clinics jaise upachaar kendro ko badhaava de rahi he
 But due to lack of testing equipment and medicines, people are not able to take full advantage of these centers
 sarkaar ne payalat project ke tahat poli clinics to khol die hai
 There are also preparations to open 150 Mohalla clinics and 100 polyclinics in Delhi in the coming days
 lekin samasya sirf infrastracchar kii nahin balki mainpavar kii bhi he
 According to the hospital administration, the government hospitals of Rajdhani are facing shortage of doctors and paramedical staff
 haalanki sarkaar khaali padon ko bharne par vichaar kar rahi he
 But at present, the effect of lack of staff is also clearly visible in the plan to get at least 12 hours of medicines in hospitals
 sarkari aspataalon ko hitech banane kii taiyaaridilli main swasthya sevaaon ko behatar banane ke liye sarkaar i-medical services par kaam kar rahi he
 With the help of technology, now government hospitals will also get quicker and better treatment
 opidi main jaanch ke liye ab ghanto intjaar nahin karnaa padegaa
 Outside the dispensary, there will also be no need to make rounds of hospitals for repeated checkups with long lines
 darasal dilli sarkaar takanic kii madad se sarkari aspataalon ko hitech banane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 According to the plan, patients will be taken in sample hospitals for all the tests done in government hospitals, but they will now be examined in master labs and not in different hospitals
 jiske liye rajeev gandhi super speshility hospital ke aadhunik lab ko chunaa gaya he
 Health cards of patients will also be made in Delhi government hospitals
 jinamein marij kii puri medical history hogi
 Using this scheme, doctors will be able to examine more patients in less time
 haalankidilli sarkaaraki is yojana kaa phayda tabhi logon ko mil paaegaa, jab sarkari aspataalon main doctor or staff kii kami dur hogi
