 sarkaar ne gharelu alpijigas silendarpar sabsidi dene ke liye graahakon ke bank acount number or aadhaar card number se conection jode jane kii baat kya kahi ki aise main gas companiyon or agenciyon kii target puraa karne main hode si lag gai he
 In such a situation, the agencies started forcibly taking Aadhaar card and bank account numbers from the customers, and blocked the thousands of connections, if the customers did not do so, the customers of these companies were very upset
 Huh
 haalanki is tarah kii jabardastee kaa praavdhaan petroleum or prakritik gas mantralay dwaara nahin diya gaya he
 When many customers complained to the gas companies about this arbitrariness, the gas connections were also started by the agencies in a hurry and requests were made to withdraw the complaint
 aise main saaf he ki gas agencia apni manamaani ke chalate hajaaron graahakon ko pareshaan kar rahi he
 Elder Vidhanath (75), a resident of Uttam Nagar, who is a Bharat Gas customer for nearly 20 years, filed an e-mail in the ministry against Naushin Gas Agency of Najafgarh, Bharat Gas on March 12
 inkaa aarope he ki pichley kai maheenon se gas agencia apni manamaani kar rahi he or aadhaar card or bank acount number na dene kii vajah se inke conection ko block kar diya he
 Gas agencies say that gas cylinders will not be available until the Aadhar card and bank account number are submitted, whereas no such rule has been implemented in the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas
 aise main jab 75 varshiya bujurg vidhinath ne mantralay main i-mail karke is baat kii shikaayat kii to gas agenciyon se lagaataar phone aane lage or gas agency ne conection open karne or gas silendar bhejne kii baat kahi par abhi tak na to gas agency or na hi gas company kii taraf se is galati ko mana gaya or na hi koi karrwai kii gai
 Gas agencies clearly say that about 4000 connections have been blocked at the behest of the marketing head of the gas company
 aisa haal sirf ek nahin kai pariwaron kaa he
 Let us tell you that while on one hand the government is directly connecting customers' connections with their Aadhaar card and bank account number to stop black marketing of domestic LPG gas and to give benefit by subsidy to the customers, the gas companies and their The agency is arbitrary by keeping all laws on hold
 agenciyon kii is harakat se graahak kaaphi pareshaan hai
 However, no such commitment has been made by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas that if the customer does not submit the Aadhaar card and bank account number, then his connection will be closed
 sarkaar dwaara ye puri prakriya sirf or sirf sabsidi dene or alpiji kalabazari ko rokane ke liye kii ja rahi he, jiske chalate 31 march tak graahakon ke bank acount number or aadhaar card agenciyon par jamaa karaane honge
 Apart from this, it can also be extended a little while giving a grace period but the gas connections will not be closed
 in sab baton ke baavjood bhi gas agenciyon ne graahakon ko pareshaan karte hue lagbhag kai hajaar conection disambar or janvari se hi band kar die or unase jabaran bank acount or aadhaar card maanga jane laga joki in agenciyon ke karmchaariyon ne khud hi sweekaar kiya he

 Although the prices of petroleum products are skyrocketing in the country, there is no visible impact in the border areas of Bihar adjoining Nepal
 bihar ke seemaayi ilaaken ke log ab nepal se petrol or dijal kharid rahe hai
 Because they are getting cheaper petrol and diesel in Nepal

 rakanpa pramukh sharad pavaar (sharad Pawar) ne somvaar raat ekatrit vidhayakon se kaha ki vah nijee taur par sunishchit karenge ki maharashtra (maharashtra) vidhansabha main shakti pareekshan ke dauraan bhaajapa ke khilaaf voting karne par kisi kii bhi sadsyta naa jaae
 Pawar was addressing a joint meeting of 162 mlas of the 'maha Vikas Aghadi' of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress at a five-star hotel in Mumbai
 pavaar ne kaha, ‘‘galat soochna failaayi ja rahi he ki ajit pavaar rakanpa ke vidhayak dal ke netaa hai, jo sabhi (rakanpa) vidhayakon ko (shakti pareekshan main) bhaajapa ko vot karne ke liye vip jari karenge
 The NCP chief said that he has consulted many constitution experts and law experts and has also looked into the issues of the past
 pavaar ne kaha, ‘‘main is nishkarsh par pahunchaa hum ki ajit pavaar jinhen unke (sarkaar gathan ke liye bhaajapa se haath milaane ke kaaran rakanpa vidhayak dal ke netaa)pad se hataa diya gaya he, unke paas vidhayakon ko vip jari karne kaa koi kanoonee adhikaar nahin he
 Referring indirectly to the BJP, Pawar said, "I personally take responsibility that your membership of the House will not be revoked
" avaidh tareeke se satta par kabja karne waalon ko ab hatana hoga
 '' 26 may 2014 ko desh kii bagdor sanbhaalane vaali modi sarkaar ke teen saal puure ho chuke hai
 Modi's name is ringing not only in the country but also abroad
 modi kii nitiyon or kaaryastylee se desh kii janata khush or vipakshi dal chup hai
 It seems that the opposition is waiting for the Modi wave to stabilize, but the Modi wave is not taking the name of the end even in the midst of the storm
 phul kawarej: modi sarkaar ke 3 saal puredrasal aaj modi sarkaar ke teen saal guzar chuke hai, vipaksh saal dar saal kamjor hota chalaa gaya
 In the last three years, Modi has made his image so big that no BJP leader is seen as his counterpart
 atal or adwani ke naam se pahachaani jane vaali party ab modi kii ho chuki he
 Obviously, time is not the same, but is there any option or possibility of Modi in BJP
 modi sarkaar ke teen saal puure hone par kuch aise hi muddon par aajtak
 in editor Panini Anand expressed her opinion
 daaliye ek najar
 
 
 You may not agree with Modi's ideology on the politics of politics, but politically Modi has raised himself to a historic height by souring the teeth of all his opponents
 modi kii yah uplabdhi bijepi kii bhi uplabdhi he
 There have been more acceptable faces in BJP than Modi, but a political success like Modi may have been a non-congress leader before
 modi sarkaar ke teen saal baad modi jahaan khadey hai, vahaan bijepi kii kalpana bina modi ke sambhav nahin thi
 a weak opposition is neither good for Modi nor power for democracy
 agar is swabhaav se javabdehi or aalochana hat jaaen to yah swabhaav taanashaah ban jaataa he
 It is important for any democracy that there is always room for criticism and accountability
 teen saal baad pradhanmantri narendra modi jis jagah khadey hai
 At that time, the position of the opposition in India is very bad
 ye naa to narendra modi ke liye acha he or naa hi loktantr ke liye
 Does BJP have an alternative to Modi? Modi's rise and three years of functioning may be a golden time for Modi and for the BJP, but for the same party, it is time for many kinds of questions in his womb
 Is boasts haalanki jeet ke bukhaar main bijepi chamchamati hi najar aegi lekin vichaar ko vyakti se bada or sanghathan ko netritv se bada bataane vaali party philhal ek vyakti kii satta ban gai he
 This is not a very good situation in terms of organizational development
 modi ke vikalp ke taur par jananaayak bhaajapa ke paas hai nahin or jinaki fouj aaj party chalaa rahi he, unase modi ke karishme ko doharaa paane kii ummid bekaar he

 In protest against the sealing done by MCD in Delhi on Tuesday i
e
 today, lakhs of traders of Delhi have come on the road
 dilli main tamaam market band ho gaye hai
 The roads are jammed
 khaas baat ye he ki is band kaa sattadhari aam aadmi party bhi samarthan kar rahi he
 Earlier on Sunday, a meeting of mps, mlas, councilors and office-bearers of the organization was also held in aap's party office in this regard
 meeting ke baad ravivaar ko party ke varisht netaa or dilli sanyojak gopal raay ne bataaya tha ki, ''dilli ke vyapaariyon ke virodh ke baavjood bijepi shasit emsidi ceiling ke madhyam se vyapaariyon kaa dhandha band karne or mazaduron kaa rojgaar chhinane kaa silsilaa jari he
 Now the central government of BJP has implemented FDI and has arranged to close the shops of traders of Delhi
 ''29 janvari ko 'aap' karegi sansad marchavahin, meeting main ye bhi tay hua he ki 23 janvari ke band ke samarthan ke baad 29 janvari ko vyapaariyon ke saath aam aadmi party virodh swaroop sansad march bhi karegi
 Actually, the budget session of Parliament is starting from this day
 is tarah se aam aadmi party ceiling ke mudde par emsidi main kabiz bijepi ko kadi takkar dene ke mood main hai
 The AAP had issued against sealing
 Poster Man Party had also issued a poster describing BJP as anti-business
 party netaaon ne bijepi par dilli ke vyapaar or rojgaar ko barbaad karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 The poster opposed sealing, FDI, demonetisation and GST
 haal hi main dilli vidhansabha main bhi vidhayakon ne epadiai ke khilaaf prastaav paas kiya tha or ceiling ke khilaaf emsidi se jawaab bhi maanga tha
 Why is sealing happening? Actually, construction works in Delhi require permission from MCD
 rajdhani ke alag-alag ilaakon main avaidh nirmaan kii shikayaton ke baad dilli hai court ne 2005 main ection kaa aadesh diya tha
 Seeing the flexible attitude of the MCD, the matter reached the Supreme Court
 supreme court ne 2006 main avaidh nirmaan kii ceiling karne ke aadesh jari kiye
 After this, the government made a provision of conversion charge to protect shops or commercial property from sealing
 kaarobaariyon ne ye charge adaa karne main bhi laaparvaahee dikhaai
 After which the Supreme Court ordered the sealing of such shops or properties and constituted a monitoring committee for this
 ab monitering cameti kii dekharekh main aisi dukaanon ko sil kiya ja rahaa he, jinhone kanvarjan charge jamaa nahin karaayaa he
 There is also an order to demolish the construction of those who do not pay the conversion charge
 nagar nigam kii is karrwai ko master plan 2021 kaa hissaa bataaya ja rahaa he
 Under this, action is being taken in posh areas like Khan Market and Defense Colony
 jisase vyapaariyon par sankat aa gaya he
 Announcing the closure, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAT) has said that under the guise of the Supreme Court order, sealing action is being taken to keep the basic provisions of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi Act 1957 under check
 vidhansabha main bhi uthaa muddadilli main chal rahe ceiling abhiyaan par jari vivaad kaa asar 15 janvari ko vidhansabha main bhi dekhne ko mila tha
 AAP BJP mlas shouted slogans accusing each other, causing the proceedings to be adjourned four times in two hours
 vipaksh ke do vidhayakon ko marshalon ne baahar tak nikaal diya tha
 Japan has said that it will ban Russia against the move to separate Crimea from Ukraine

 Russian President Vladimir Putin signed an order recognizing Crimea as an independent nation on Monday following a recent referendum
 yah janamat sangrah kreemia ko ukraine se alag kar rus ke saath milaane ke sambandh main kiya gaya tha
 This move by Russia has given rise to the crisis that emerged between the countries of East and West after the Cold War
 japan ke videsh mantri ne aaj apane bayaan main kaha, yah khedjanak he ki rus ne kreemia ke swytt ganraajya ko swatantra raashtra ke taur par manyata di he
 The move violates Ukraine's sovereignty and its integrity
 isamen yah bhi kaha gaya he ki japan rus ko vija niyamon main dheel dene ke sambandh main jari vaarta ko radd kar degaa or ab vah nae nivesh samjhauton va antariksh kaaryakramon par bhi baatcheet shuru nahin karegaa
 In addition, Japan will not proceed with a treaty on risky military operations with Russia
 america or europe ne kal rus ke khilaaf pratibandhon kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 The White House says it will be the toughest sanctions against Russia since the Cold War
 haalanki abhi tak putin ne apane kadam peeche khinchne ke sanket nahin die hai or kreemia ke moscow samarthit adhikari ravivaar ke janamat sangrah ke nateezon par tatkaal kaam karne kii yojana bana rahe hai
 About 97 percent of the people in the referendum have favored meeting with Russia

 But it was not registered as a political party

 teachers de par aapane achche shikshakon kii darjanon kahaniyaan suni hongi
 But in real life, only good teachers are available, this is not the case
 to sabase bure teachers kaise hote hai? aaj ham aapako sabase bure teachers kii kuch sachhee kahaniyaan padhaa rahe hai
 
 
 If the teacher beaten, he kept biting ants all night in Gwalior
 main privet skool main 7veen main padhata tha
 Once, a teacher named Rakesh Likhar beat me so much that i didn't realize how much i was hurt
 main tab raat main papa ke saath sota tha
 i did not let them sleep overnight and said that i am biting ants
 papa ko kahin chitiyaan nahin mili
 But in the morning they showed me that there were signs of beating in my back
 ustichar ne mujhe isliye maratha kyonki mere judawaan bhai ko maths main mujhase adhik number aae the or mujhe kam
 They said, why can't you bring that number
 -vijay rawatapadhaane se zyada peetane main anand lete the vomere science ke teacher ek the jinhen student ko padhaane se zyada peetane main anand aata tha
 Many a time, he used to cock the children and put the bags on the back and send them to other classes
 ye mujhe behad apmanjanak lagata tha
 It had a mentally negative impact on many children
 bacchon ke mata-pita ne is bare main kai baar shikaayat kii, lekin teacher par koi asar nahin hua
 Eventually, when two children took their names from school, the school administration came into prominence
 antat: us teacher ko hi skool se barkhaast kar diya gaya
 - Mahendra Gupta was a teacher from his family, so i was not made a topper, in class 11, i achieved first rank in the class
 mujhe report card bhi isi rank ke saath mili
 But when the award was ceremonial, my rank was second in the list given to the principal and second ranked in the first number
 jab maine class teacher se baat kii to unhone kaha ki aisa duusari ladki ke moral boost karne ke liye kiya gaya he
 i later came to know from the children of the class that the teacher had close relations with the girl's family
 -aarti mishrouse teacher ko 40 main se sirf 2 bachche the pasandskool janaa haalanki mujhe kabhi pasand nahin tha lekin jab 7veen class main aakar hamaare course main nayaa subject 'sanskrit' judaa
 Since then, i had become hated by the name School
 skool main shuru kii 4 class acchhee hoti thim lekin lunch brake ke baad 5veen class hoti thi 'sanskrit' kii
 Our Sanskrit teacher was somewhat different
 jaise hi wo class main aati to sab bachche unhen vish karne ke liye khadey hote lekin unamem gine chune hi bachche hote the jo seat par waapas baith pate the
 Because she used to send the children back to the class room as soon as they arrived
 aapane ai-card nahin pahana peeche chale jaaie, aapke riban nahin hai aap bhi peeche jaaen, aapaki belt gaayab he aap bhi peeche nikal jaaie, ab jinka homework puraa nahin he wo or jo books nahin laae wo peeche jaaen baaki sab baith jaaen
 In his class, there were probably only 2 or 3 children in 40
 mujhe yaad he ki main unki class main sirf ek hi din baithi thi
 -premita Sharmameri sister went to school, the principal even cut my name
 i was in 9th grade
 mere saath skool main mere chote bhai-bahan bhi padhate the
 But father had enrolled the sisters in a government school in Manendragarh, a small town in Chhattisgarh

 The 48 as basic salary, bonus and benefits to the coin last year
 7 karod rupee die gaye
 At the same time, his basic salary in the partial period of 2015 was 4
 5 karod rupee tha
 Murthy also questioned the former CFO Rajiv Bansal being given Rs 23 crore as a 30-month package to break away from the company
 murti ne ek nijee samachar channel se kaha ki infosis main do siefo the jo company chhod gaye the
 There were other senior people on the board such as the senior vice president, etc
, who had such competitive information, but we did not pay them anything
 isse kuch asamanjas kii sthiti paidaa hui he

 Murthy told a private news channel that Infosys had two cfos who left the company
 board main anya varisht log masalan varisht upaadhyaksh aadi the, jinke paas aisi pratispardhi suchanaaen thim, lekin hamane unhen kuch bhugtan nahin kiya tha
 This has led to some confusion
 bazaar main is tarah kii atakalein hai ki bansal ko yah bhugtan isliye kiya gaya kyonki unke paas infosis ko nuksaan pahunchane ke bare main soochna thi, murti ne kaha ki main ummid karata hum ki yah maamla nahin ho

 After all, why is Amit Shah in such a hurry? In response to this, Home Minister Amit Shah, who came in the concluding session of Agenda Aaj Tak, said that he was not making any haste, but was waiting for these works for the last 70 years

 In 1967, Jack was instrumental in stopping Goa's accession to Maharashtra
 congress ke vidhayakon ne iskaa samarthan kiya, lekin maharashtravaadi gomantak party chaahati thi ki vahaan samaajawaadee netaa ram manohar lohia kii murti lagaai jaae
 The BJP MLA is in favor of installing the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji here
 jieffpi ke netaa or rajya ke nagar niyojan mantri vijay saradesai ne jor diya ki goa kii pahchaan banaae rakhane ke liye sequeira ko sammanit karnaa jaruri he
 It was only on his initiative in 1967 that the people of Goa voted to remain a union territory instead of merging Maharashtra
 bhaajapa or emjeepi, donon ne pehle yah prastaav sweekaar kiya tha ki vidhansabha parisar main rajya ke pehle mukhyamantri dayanand bandodkar kii pratimaa lagi hui he or kisi anya pratimaa kii jarurat nahin he
 But when deputy speaker Michael Lobo (BJP) and former Chief Minister Churchill Alemao (GFP) supported the demand for the statue of Sequeira, the two parties changed attitude
 bhaajapa vidhayak rajesh paatanekar ne daawa kiya ki unke kshetra dicolim se shivaji kaa naata tha
 So the head of MGP Deepak Dhavalikar wants that T
 in the assembly complex
 bi
 Put a statue of Cunha, who led the movement to liberate Goa from the Portuguese in 1961
 jieffpi ke netaa saradesai kehete hai ki sabase pehle emjeepi ko apane naam se 'maharashtra' shabd hataa lenaa chahie
 This leaves Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar in a dilemma
 ve na to sequeira kii pratimaa lagane kaa virodh kar sakate hai or na hi samarthan
 Their argument is also weak that "no more idols should be installed, because their maintenance costs are too much

 Aaj Tak has exposed another lie of the Akhilesh government with another investigation on the suspension of IAS Durga Shakti Nagpal
 us jhooth kaa jise durga ke nilamban kaa aadhaar banaaya gaya
 Yes, there is talk of falling communal tension due to falling mosque wall
 aaj tak kii team sach kii padtaal ke liye kadalpur gaanv gai thi
 What the intelligence cameras have seen till date is enough to take away the Akhilesh government's claim
 kadalpur gaanv jahaan masjid kii charadivari kii jab ek diwaar giri to gaanv shant tha lekin akhilesh yadav kii sarkaar bhadak uthi
 Aaj Tak tried to know the heart of those villagers who were collecting funds to build the mosque wall on the secret camera
 aaj tak ne jab baar-baar ye poochne kii koshish kii ki kya diwaar giraaye jane ke baad vahaan danga bhadakne jaisi koi sthiti thi to us gaanv ke rahane vaale idrish ke saathi kasam khaakar yakeen dilaane lage ki tanaav jaisi koi baat hi nahin
 The villagers may be angry at the fall of the wall, but they do not agree with Akhilesh Sarkar's statement that the riots are going on
 sach to ye he ki lakhanu main baithi sarkaar jin reporton ke aadhaar par durga shakti par ye aarope madh rahi he ki unki karrwai ne gaanv main sampradayik tanaav khadaa kar diya unheen reporton ko ab thana, dm or khud gaanv ke log jhuthla rahe hai

 And i have always tried to follow that
 bhartiya loktantr kii khaasiyat rahi he vividhta or abhivyakti kii azaadi
 The BJP did not consider its opponents as enemies from the beginning
 hamase sahamat na rahane waalon ko bhi kabhi raashtra virdohi nahin kaha
 My party developed on truth, national loyalty and democracy
 laalkrishna adwani ko is baar loksabhaa chunaav main party ne tikat nahin diya he or unki paaramparik gandhinagar seat se bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah chunaav lard rahe hai

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was dreaming of a big victory in the Lok Sabha elections in Assam in 2019 by creating an atmosphere in the northeastern states through the National Civil Register (NRC)
 lekin jis tarah se chunaav se ain pehle naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak virodh or ab sthaayee nivasee pramaan patr (PRC) ko lekar arunachal kaa maahaul tanaavpurn ho gaya he
 In the heat of this protest, the bjp's hopes of victory are seen scorching
 bataa den ki arunachal pradesh main rajya ke baahar ke 6 samudaayon ko sthaayee nivasee hone kaa certificate dene ke khilaaf log acroshit hai or sadak par utarkar hinsa kar rahe hai
 Demonstrators set fire to the Deputy Chief Minister's house

 The BJP currently has 8 seats in the Northeast
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad se bijepi ne purvottar ke rajyon par khaas dhyaan diya he
 As a result, the BJP has made the Northeast 'congress-free'
 vahiin, purvottar ke rajyon main bijepi khud sarkaar chalaa rahi he yaa phir sahyogi dal ke rup main he
 In fact, the BJP wants to compensate the possible losses in North and West India in the Lok Sabha elections through the states of the Northeast
 lekin jis tarah se purvottar main virodh ke sur uthe hai, usase bijepi ke plan ko bada dhakka lagata hua najar aa rahaa he
 In fact, after the release of the draft list of NRC in Assam, there was a demand for the implementation of NRC in all the states of the Northeast, which is facing the problem of illegal infiltrators
 centre kii bijepi sarkaar ke is kadam ko jabardast samarthan hasil hua
 Explain that by presenting Muslim infiltrators from Bangladesh as a threat to the security of the country, the BJP has been creating an atmosphere by giving this issue a constructive form
 vahiin, bijepi ne in chunaavon main padosi deshon main utpeedan kaa shikaar hokar bharat aane vaale hindu sharnaarthiyon ko naagarikta dene kaa vaada apane ghoshnaptr main kiya tha
 But the tone of opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Bill and Permanent Resident Certificate has arisen
 wo bijepi ko baichaiyn kar rahe hai
 People and regional parties stood in protest in all the northeastern states over the Citizenship Amendment Bill

 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi phir se bundelkhand main hai
 This time he has come to Bundelkhand with his farmer journey

 Rahul is constantly among the farmers

 The 'aaj Tak' team learned that the farmers had spent an entire night in 2011 in Meerki village of Hanjhansi, by Rahul Gandhi
 ek garib kisaan kunjee kodi ke ghar aae the
 Had dinner with family also
 'aaj tak' team ne phir usee parivaar or usee gaanv kaa daura kiya jahaan kabhi rahul gandhi ne kisaanon ke haal jane the
 Key Kodi's family has still kept those pictures from Jatan, in which Rahul is sitting among the family
 unki baaten sun rahe hai
 No Congress leader came to the village after Rahul, Key Kodi's family of Meri has been a Congressman
 kunjee kodi to nahin rahe lekin unka parivaar aaj bhi yahaan hai
 Rahul Gandhi helped the family when Key Kodi was battling cancer
 duusari orilaake ke kisanonki maane to rahul ke aane se unki haalat main koi sudhaar raheen hua
 Neither the government gave any help nor any Congress leader came to take care of them
 logon ko yakeen he ki congress kii sarkaar nahin banegeelogon kaa kahana he ki rahul gandhi kahaan the jab pichley chaar saalon se yahaan kaa kisaan sookhe kii maar jhel rahaa tha
 While staying in the village, Rahul definitely stayed, but the village never got the benefit of it
 bhale hi iskaa phaaydarahul gandhi komila ho, lekin kisaan ke liye kuch nahin ho paaya
 Most of the farmers in the village are definitely happy that Rahul is taking up the issue of debt waiver
 iske baavjood un sabko yakeen nahin he ki ye karj maaf ho sakati he
 Because everyone believes that the government is not going to be formed by the Congress
