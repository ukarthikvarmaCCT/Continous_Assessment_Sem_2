bas yaheen se lekhan kii shuruyaat hui
 Let me tell you that my conscience has also expanded with my sentimentality and sensitivity
 isiilie praayah logabagh mujhe avyavhaarik or murkh maanate hai, jo meri samaj se uchit hi he
 2
 aap apni kavitaaon kaa vishay kahaan se chunate hai?- kavita ke liye vishay main jivan se hi letaa hoon, prakruti, samaaj, samay - sab jivan main hi shaamil hai
 When outside events go inside, shaking the emotions, then the poem explodes
 sangharsh jab karunaa main dhalataa he tab kavita rachi jaati he
 3
 sahityakaron kii jhandabardaari, or kisi khaas vichaardhaara se uske lagaav par aapaki pratikriya?- ek naagarik ke rup main jhandabardaari kii zarurat ho sakati he lekin kavi ke rup nahin
 Yes, ideology is a must, an ideology that helps in understanding the struggle and compassion of the last man of the society, give strength and courage to stand in his favor
 samaj hi nahin, anubhav ke vistaar ke liye bhi vichaardhaara zaruri he
 But, keep in mind that ideology creates a new or different power against power, whereas the poet's job is to create coexistence against power

 How satisfied are you with the current state of poetry in Hindi literature? It is often seen that publishers also shy away from publishing poems, who do you think is responsible for this? - Poetry has its limits and special features too, if they are identified properly, such questions will not arise
 kavita thodi vyapaktaa tabhi paati he jab samaaj main koi bada andolan hota he, jaise bhakthi andolan yaa swatantraaa andolan
 But poetry is written and written even on bad days
 uski sthai bhoomika he pathak kii samvednaa kaa vistaar karnaa
 Even today it is being written and also read
 kavita sankalan bikate bhi hai
 Publishers are happy to print, but are often annoyed at not giving the collection or withdrawing
 haan, yah kavi ko jaan or samaj lenaa chahie ki uske pathak hai yaa
 
 
 Although institutions buy fiction and criticism, they do not buy poetry collections and plays
 acha he ki kavita kaa bazaar nahin he, uske thode hi sahi lekin patibaddh pathak hai
 5
 kavi ke liye puraskaar kaa kitna mahatva he? aaj kaa sahityakar kya suvidhaon or puraskaron ke liye samjhaute kar rahaa he?- puraskaar kaa koi mahatva nahin he, sivaa iske ki isse kuch naye pathak mil jate hai, kuch logon kaa dhyaan chalaa jaataa he
 Opposing it is also to acknowledge its importance
 acha lekhak kabhi jugad nahin karata, sahajata se mil jaye to use sweekaar kar lenaa chahie, basharte dene ke peeche koi raajnneeti nahin ho
 6
 ek kavi ke rup main aaj ke siyaasi halaat par aapaki tippanee?- siyaasi halaat bahut bure hai, kyonki aaj ke rajaneta saamaajik yatharth ko samajhane, usase takaraane or samaaj ko behatar banane kaa rasta nikaalane kaa upkram nahin kar rahe hai
 Lies and deceit are dominated
 ek aisi aapraadhik lokapriyata rachane or samuhik sammohan paidaa karne kii koshish ho rahi he jiske dushprinaam bahut aage chalakar dikhenge
 The biggest crisis of democracy is that it is becoming oppositionless
 virdohi dal satta ke agenda ke irdagird hi chakkar laga rahe hai
 Not only India, there is a need for major political change at the global level
 haal hi main ukraine main hua chunaav dekh lijie, vahaan ek aisa vyakti raashtrapati kaa chunaav jeet gaya, jo peshewar camedian he, koi raajnneetik anubhav nahin he
 Now the direction has to be changed

 Your favorite poets - litterateurs, senior, contemporary and new writers and their compositions, to name a few? - Leave this question

 And the list is so long
 
 
 
 
 maaf kiijie!8
 Between 2009 and 2011, you wrote a number of poems that seem more accurate in today's context, such as 'conqueror the Assassin' and 'new Age Dealers'
 is purvanubhuti kii vajah?- darasal, yah koi purvanubhuti yaa purvanumaan nahin, sookshm objarveshan kaa maamla he
 The poet not only sees the reality of his time in events, but also undertakes to recognize his inner dynamics, this is possible
 keval 2009 se 2011 ke bich kii hi nahin, 1990 ke baad kii meri kai aisi kavitaayen hai jo aaj zyaada praasangik lag sakati hai
 9
 in dinon nayaa kya likh rahe hai?-kuch khaas nahin
 The excuse of writing a novel has become so old that even now it cannot be defended
 haan, kuch bhinn tarah ke niabandh likh rahaa hoon
 These are completely different from fine essays
 main inhen kavy niabandh kahana pasand karuunga

 siyasat main sahitya or sahitya kii siyasat par aapaki pratikriya?- siyasat main sahitya kii jagah kahan rah gayi he? bas dinakar or dushyant jaise kaviyon kii kuch panktiyaan kabhi-kabhi netaaon ke kaam aa jaati hai
 Yes, politics has a place in literature, because not only society, time is also being controlled by politics, but sometimes it seems to be trying to control political history and culture too
 aise main siyasat kii chunautiyon se jujhna sahitya kaa dharm he
 But the politics of literature is a very bad thing
 yah padon-puraskaron ke liye hoti he or lekhan ko kshati pahunchaati he
 In one line, i am in favor of the expression of politics in literature, but i am a strong opponent of the politics of literature

 ) The compensation to the farmers who are destroyed by the unseasonal rain is like cumin in the camel's mouth
 haalanki upi sarkaar centre kii tay rakam se doguna muaavja de rahi he, lekin phir bhi dedh se do sau rupee ke kuch check bhi baante ja rahe hai
 When the government became strict, the officers started reaching the villages
 camp lagaakar check die gaye hai
 See the amount of compensation in the village of Faizabad, Rs 187, Rs 188
 itane main to kisi dhabas main ek aadmi kaa ek vakt kaa khaanaa bhi na ho
 Faizabad farmer Ram Sumer said, we will not be able to make a living in it
 isse ham logon ko koi laabh nahin hoga
 In this way, how will children be raised from it? Another farmer of Faizabad, Jag Prasad said, will have to commit suicide
 hamako bacchon ko jehar dena padegaa
 The amount of government compensation is like cumin in the camel's mouth
 centre ke puraane niyam se acinchit ilaake main muaavja 4500 rupee prati hectare or sinchit main 9000 rupee prati hectare he
 There are four bighas i
e
 80 kathas in a hectare
 is tarah ek bigha kaa muaavja sinchit main 1225 rupee hua
 If there are five owners in a bigha in the revenue record, then each one gets Rs 225 in compensation
 upi sarkaar iskaa doguna de rahi he, lekin shaayad isse zyada rakam to muaavja baantne main kharch ho rahi hogi
 Barabanki farmer Ram Saran Verma said, the cultivation cost of wheat is 20 thousand per hectare
 sarson kii 15000 rupee or aalu memprati hectare ek lakh 20 hajaar se dedh lakh rupee kaa kharch aa rahaa he
 20,000 is coming in peas, so any cost of cultivation, which is our cost, is very less than that
 isse kisaanon ko bahut laabh hone vaala nahin he
 Crop insurance is also available to a small number of farmers in UP
 usamen bhi tamaam pench hai
 When asked the question of Badri Prasad, a farmer of Barabanki, that whatever crop insurance is there, will there be any money? So he told that manure is taken on loan
 usamen bataate hai ki 70 pratishat nuksaan hoga to fasal beemaa kaa laabh milegaa or yahaan sarkaar 25-30 fisadi dikhaati he
 He will not get any benefit
 muaavje kii hakeekat jaanane ham gaanv-gaanv ghume

 Documents of about 400 depositors and Rs 7 crore worth of documents have been recovered from them

 At present, the police is busy collecting the necessary information from the recovered documents and the laptop found in the raid
 aaropee police kii giraft main hai
 Vicious cyclists were traveling in 25-25 lakh vehicles
 is aishoaaraam ke liye shaatiron ke paas jo rakam aa rahi thi, usko jutaney ke liye inhone jo rasta apanaaya, vah behad chaunkaane vaala he
 These crooks were luring people to double the money by printing dyeing on T-shirts and showing the magic of printing in the name of Aayush Technology in the table
 jamaa kii jane vaali rakam par ye log 6 maheene main rakam dugana karne kaa jhansa dete the
 Not only this, these people also gave the impression of paying 13 and half percent interest on the given amount and deposited hundreds of crores of rupees in the business
 police ke chaape main inke paas se 400 se zyada jamakartaon kii suchi or 7 se 8 karod rupee kaa len-dein ujagar hua he

 sarini ke bagdona ilaake main pichley paanch saal se ye log koyala khadaan main kaam karne vaale kamgaaron, power house ke karmchaariyon or naukari pesha logon ko jhansa de rahe the
 The police were aware of this for a long time, but the police were unable to hand over the gang due to the non-complainant
 haal hi main police ko mili ek yuvak ne shikaayat kii ki usase ek lakh rupee dugane karne ke naam par liye gaye
 When the time came for the amount to be doubled, he was asked to repatriate two lakh rupees
 yah rakam usase phir jamaa karvaa lee gayi, lekin uski vaapasi ke vakt giroh waapas rakam dene se mukar gaya
 This mistake became a cause of trouble for the gang

 Police have arrested Aayush's director Santosh Das, employee Hariram and the company's HR Mukesh Bal in this case

 He says he was raising money from people to run several of his firms

 mana ja rahaa he ki is giroh ko ilaake ke kai namchin netaaon kaa na keval sangrakshan mila hua he balki unka is gorakhdhandhe main hissaa bhi he
 It remains to be seen what further secrets the police reveal in front of them

 The Kashmir issue has become a sore throat for Pakistan
 use pataa nahin chal rahaa ki aage karnaa kya he
 He raised the issue of Article 370 quite a lot in front of the world fraternity but not a single argument was made
 sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke lagbhag sabhi deshon (china ko chhodkar) ne use bairang lautaa diya
 Now only China is left who is listening to its complaint, that too under pressure because much of China is at stake in Pakistan
 sanyukt raashtra china ke gidgidaane par kashmir mudde par shuukravaar ko baithak karne ja rahaa he
 It has never happened that an institution like the United Nations has to meet behind closed doors, but which China should not do at the behest of Pakistan
 sanyukt raashtra ke itihaas main yah doosraa mauka he jab kashmir mudde par koi baithak hone ja rahi he
 However, the second meeting differs from the first meeting in 1971 in many ways
 pehali baithak na to band daravaaje ke peeche thi or na hi suraksha parishad ke adhikansh sadsy deshon ne pakistan kaa samarthan karne se manaa kiya tha
 The issue of Kashmir was raised under the topic 'situation in the India / Pakistan Subcontinent' at UNSC in 1969-71
 UNSC ke in deshon ne paak ko kaha nasamyukt raashtra suraksha parishad (yuanessi) main kul 15 sadsy hai
 Of these, 5 are permanent and 10 are temporary
 asthai sadasyon kaa kaarykaal kuch varshon ke liye hota he jabaki sthai sadsy hameshaa ke liye hote hai
 Permanent members include the US, Russia, China, Britain and France
 asthai deshon main belgium, kot devoer, dominic republic, equatorial guyani, germany, indonesia, kuwait, peru, poland or south africa jaise desh hai
 Among the permanent members, except China, the rest of the countries - France, Russia, Britain and America have shown Pakistan to be cheated
 inkaa spasht kahana he ki kashmir mudda hindustan or pakistan kaa aantarik masalaa he, isliye donon desh milakar nipten, kisi tisare paksh kii isamen darkaar nahin
 China is not compelled that China is a close neighbor of Pakistan and can do anything for its friendly nation
 china ke saamne badi majaburi belt road initiative (biaaro) he jiskaa bada hissaa pakistan se hokar guzar rahaa he
 China has thrown a lot in this big road construction project
 arabon yuan kii raashi usne road project main lagaai he or pakistan se yaari banaae rakhane ke liye vahaan badi maatra main nivesh kiya he
 In such a situation, China has only two options
 pehla yah ki vah pakistan ko jhidak de or apane boote biaaro ko aage badaye
 The other option is to help Pakistan by tolerating everything in front of it
 pakistan ko china jhidak nahin saktaa kyonki use pataa he isse uskaa paisa to dubegaa hi, road project main jaan-maal kii bhi badi kshati hogi
 It is worth noting that the Pakistani terrorists have created chaos in many countries but so far they have not touched any Chinese citizens who are engaged in BRO project
 isliye china har napha-nuksaan dekhte hue pehle vikalp main tikna chahta he
 So in the UNSC meeting, he is helping Pakistan
 asthai sadasyon se china ko thengakul 10 asthai deshon main poland akelaa raashtra jo pakistan ke saath khadaa dikh rahaa he
 Although this is his diplomatic compulsion
 usne bharat or pakistan ke is bakhede se khud ko kaaphi dur rakhaa he lekin poland chunki is vakt yuanessi kaa rotating president he, isliye uske saamne baithak karana hi antim vikalp he
 This should not be construed to mean that Poland is with Pakistan on the Kashmir issue
 vah kisi raashtra ke saath nahin he balki asthai deshon kii ore se baithak kii mejabani kar rahaa he
 Apart from Poland, Belgium, Côte d'ivoire, Dominic Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Germany, Indonesia, Kuwait, Peru and South Africa have completely ruled out Pakistan
 in deshon se pakistan ko dhele bhar kaa samarthan nahin milane vaala
 Then Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi cried sadly in front of the world fraternity that everyone went to the threshold, but no one gave a sense
 yuanessi deshon kii vito prakriyasamyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main vito kii prabal prakriya he
 Its role is very important in getting the green signal to any Adoption (proposal) or rejecting it
 sanyukt raashtra charter kii ore se tay sharton ke tahat, suraksha parishad ke sthaayee sadasyon ke vito kaa adhikaar pratibandhit he, arthath yah mukhya rup se suraksha parishad ke kaamkaaj se sambandhit ke maamalon main lagu nahin hota he
 In such a situation, the Security Council needs the support of nine members to make a decision, whether they are permanent or non-permanent members of the Security Council

 Morcha activists reached the Congress headquarters at 24 Akbar Road and raised slogans
 is dauraan ek aisa mauka aayaa jababijepicaryakarta rahul gandhi jindabad ke naare lagane lage
 Workers of the BJP Purvanchal Morcha who reached the Congress office at 12 noon on Sunday (october 14) said that the attack on the people of Bihar and UP in Gujraj was a conspiracy by Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Congress MLA from Gujarat Alpesh Thakorki
 bijepi kaaryakartaaon ne aarope lagaaya ki gujarat main asthirataa failaane or bijepi sarkaar ko badnaam karne ke liye congress ne aisa kiya he
 The police had already made arrangements here for security

 During the protest, BJP Purvanchal Morcha president Manish Singh was seen cheering the party workers
 unhone party kaaryakartaaon se kaha ki aap india get tahalne nahin balki pradarshan main shaamil hone aae hai
 During the protest, when BJP worker Manoj Tiwari was raising slogans of Zindabad, Rahul Gandhi's name came in the middle

 Just before the result, senior Congress leaders praised the party's newly elected president Rahul Gandhi, saying that the way he campaigned during the election, he was confident that the exile of the Congress would end this time
 gujarat ke prabharee congress mahasachiv ashok gahalot ne kaha ki ham gujarat main jeet ko lekar aashwast hai
 The manner in which Rahul Gandhi led the campaign and did issue-based politics, he forced the BJP to resort to such things, which was not an issue, to garner people's sympathy
 rajasthan ke purv mukhyamantri gahalot serahul kii pehali parikshake babat poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki yah mudda hi nahin he
 Rather, the point is that he came forward and commanded the Gujarat campaign, besieging Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP chief on development issues
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa ke paas rahul gandhi ke sawaalon kaa koi jawaab nahin tha or ve log gujarati gaurav kii baaten karne ko majaboor ho gaye
 Rahul Gandhi won in this

 If he somehow proves that there is a secret political nexus between Modi and Mulayam
 isamen koi shaq nahin he ki mulaayam singh yadav ko apana netaa maanane vaale muslim votaron ko agar ye pataa chale kimodi-mulaayamake bich najdiki bad rahi he, to ve sapa se naaraaz ho jaaenge
 It is worth noting that the Bahujan Samaj Party also paid for this when they aligned with the BJP

 In the Lok Sabha elections 2009, the Congress did better
 uski vajah thi kalyaan singh kaa mulaayam singh yadav ke saath hona
 Kalyan Singh is considered responsible for the Babri Masjid demolition
 jab 1992 main yah haadasa hua tha, tab upi main bijepi kii sarkaar kaa netritv mukhyamantri ke taur par kalyaan singh hi kar rahe the
 After the 2009 elections, Mulayam Singh Yadav had apologized and said, 'it was only my fault
 main alpsankhyak samudaay se yah vaada karata hoon ki bhavishya main aisi galati phir nahin hogi
 'unsurprisingly, but the repetition of such a mistake can help the Congress before the 2017 assembly elections
 isliye congress netaa rajya main vidhansabha chunaav se bahut pehle hi modi-mulaayam kii tathakthith najdiki ko mudda banane kii taiyaari main jute gaye hai
 For this purpose, Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee President Nirmal Khatri took out Jan Jagran Yatra to make people aware in Mulayam Singh Yadav's home district Etawah
 is maukey par congress netaa khatri ne kaha, '21 farvari ko modi ne saifai, itawa jaakar mulaayam singh yadav ke pote kii shaadi main shirkat kii
 Because they have a very good personal and political intimacy
 jis tarah se modi or mulaayam ne samaaroh main ek duusare ke haath pakade hue the vah is baat kaa saboot he ki donon ek-duusare ke bahut kareebi hai
 'khatri may have been too hasty to assess the situation
 yah baat sahi he ki saifai main tilak mahotsav ke dauraan manch par chadhate samay mulaayam singh yadav ne modi kaa haath pakadaa hua tha
 But Modi did not allow the SP chief to hold his hand
 unhone keval ekta kii bhaavana jataane ke liye apana haath hawa main unke saath laharaaya tha
 The sharp-eyed people had realized how fast Modi had pulled his hand back because he did not want to give any sign of misleading the majority
 modi ne khud mulaayam singh yadav se manch par khaasi duuri banaae rakhi jo vahaan maujuud mehmaanon ko bhi dikh rahi thi
 The SP chief is considered one of the smartest politicians in the country
 shaayad ve apane putr or uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ko majboot banane ke liye modi kaa samarthan chaahate hon
 Perhaps Modi also wants to keep distance from them
 lekin ek hi samay main unhone santulan kaa parichay dete hue yah bhi darsha diya ki vah muslim matadaataaon par nirbhar hai
 Mulayam Singh Yadav once again opposed the bjp-led NDA government in the matter of Land Acquisition Bill and the General Budget, and hinted at how to retain their Muslim vote bank in the 2017 assembly elections
 Will continue to oppose Modi
 modi ko siyaasi taur par asthir rajyon me hone vaale chunaavon kii mahatta kaa ahsaas he
 Being a Member of Parliament from Banaras, he cannot afford to ignore the majority of his voters who voted him in the Lok Sabha 2014 elections
 jaankaar kehete hai ki is samay modi apni strangaman vaali chhavi par dobaaraa dhyaan dena chaahate hai, jo sabhi bharatiyon ko aakarshith karti he

 com / ca1apfwbwc — taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) January 23, 2019 It is worth mentioning that according to the government, Netaji died in a plane crash in 1945 but thirty years later Netaji suddenly came back into the limelight
 darasal faijabad main rahane vaale gumnami baba kaa 1985 main dehanth hua tha
 Two days later, he was cremated in a secret manner
 unhen gumnami baba isliye bulaayaa jaataa tha kyonki vah kisi se milte-julate nahin the
 However, people were surprised when pictures of Netaji's family from Gumnami Baba's room, articles related to Netaji published in several newspapers and magazines, letters from several big personalities and Shahnawaz were set up to investigate Netaji's alleged death
 The Commission and the Khosla Commission were also present

 Dead or Alive
 a thrilling # webseries, in which @rajkummar_rao plays Subhash Chandra Bose, completely justifies the Hero
 His makeup is commendable and looks exactly like the real person, whom we have always seen in the print media
 The background score and the rap in Bangla brings alive the revolutionary feeling
 a lot of attention has gone into the detailing 
 Although, it does not tell anything that we do not know about Bose, nonetheless it manages to keep the viewers attention undisturbed

 Chief Minister of Telangana
 chandrashekhar raav (kesiar) rajya main shashan ko uttaradaayi or bhrashtachar mukt karne ke liye kuch doorgaami prashasnic sudhaaron par jor de rahe hai
 After a long closed door meeting on August 20 and a five-hour field visit the following day, KCR told the 33 district collectors of the state that various measures should be implemented to make the administration more accountable
 prastaavit kadamon main aagaamee nayaa rajasav vidheyak he, jo soochna praudyogiki ke istemaal se paardarshita ke saath ek samay seemaa ke bheetar bhrashtachar mukt sevaayen pehle se adhik dakshata ke saath muhaiyaa karaane kaa vaada karata he
 The Bill will provide power to District Collectors to take action against officials and elected representatives for financial irregularities or misappropriation of funds
 kesiar ne kaha, ''angreji raaj kii ore se adhiniyamit rajasav kanoon se janata or rajya ko baari nuksaan pahunch rahaa he
 About 150 revenue laws need to be changed
 ''shashan ko lakshyonmukh banane ke liye jila colectoron kii jimmedaariyon or kaaryon ko saajha karne kii jarurat hogi tathaa iske liye unke dipti niyukt karne kii bhi yojana he
 These officials will also monitor the performance of public representatives including ministers
 kesiar ne telugana ko bhoomi-mukademebaaji mukt banane kaa bhi iraadaa jataayaa he
 There are 3,00,000 pending cases related to land ownership in the state
 jila colectoron ke saath kesiar kii baithak se ek din pehle, sarkaar ne somesh kumaar ko rajeshwar tiwari ke sthaan par vishesh mukhya sachiv (rajasav) or mukhya ayukta (bhoomi prashasan) niyukt kiya
 It is being said that KCR felt that Tiwari did not make enough efforts to update land record website Dharni, which was launched with great fanfare two years ago, to correct the errors in land revenue records
 website ke rajasav record main 'ocupair (pattedaar)' or 'enjoir (upabhokta) ' jaise kollam hataa liye jaaenge taaki jab koi bhu-swami apni jameen ko patte par detaa he, to uske swaamitv adhikaron ke saath koi samjhauta na hone paae
 KCR also wants the Village Revenue Officer system to be scrapped and employees associated with that department be enlisted with Panchayati Raj or agriculture departments
 haalanki, rajasav karmchaaree sanghon ko dar he ki in badlaavon se unke vibhaag ke liye pahchaan kaa sankat khadaa ho jayega, isliye ve iskaa virodh kar rahe hai
 Meanwhile, the anti-corruption Bureau (ACB) is tightening its grip on tainted revenue officials
 asibi ke ek varisht sutara ne bataaya, ''bhrashtachar kii shikaayatein ucch mulya ke lenden main kaam karne vaale rajasav karyaalayon se adhik aati hai, yahaan tak ki karmchaaree apane mobile phone main doosraa sim daalkar yaa phir apane driveron ke phone se kol karke rishwat kii maang karte hai
 The state also needs to raise additional resources as the Center is not expected to get grants for major projects like Kaleswaram Lift Irrigation Scheme, Mission Bhagirath and Mission Kakatiya
 sarkaar in pariyojnaon par har saal hajaaron karod rupye kharch kar rahi he
 Apart from administrative efficiency, KCR would also like these reforms to strengthen the support base of his party Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) in the state
 unhen ummid he ki nae panchayat raaj or nagarpalika kanoonon ke saath rajasav sudhaar janata ke liye bahut-si suvidhaayen laaenge or isse 2023 main tiares ko lagaataar teesri baar satta main pahunchane main madad milegi

 Nowadays the news is loud that the Aam Aadmi Party will once again form the government in Delhi? It is obvious that in the 70-seat assembly, the Aam Aadmi Party has 27 mlas
 (28 the lekin ek ko party ne nikaal diya) So to form the government, support will have to be taken by eight Congress mlas, although the number must be 36, but three BJP mlas because now they have reached Parliament, the Congress can be formed with the support of Congress
 lekin kahani is guna bhaag kii nahin he, kahani ye he ki aam aadmi party kaa loksabhaa main pradarshan kharaab rahaa he, apane ghar dilli kii sabhi siten to haare hi saath hi aravind kejariwal ko chhod dilli se baahar sabhi bade netaaon kii zamaanat zabt ho gai And speaking of Delhi itself, BJP has an edge over 60 assembly seats here, whereas the Aam Aadmi Party could retain the lead in only 10
 aam aadmi party main awaz uth rahi he ki hamako sarkaar banani chahie or jo log ye awaz uthaa rahe hai unke paas isaki vajah bhi hai
 Firstly, leaving the government in Delhi increased the resentment of the party across the country and the atmosphere worsened for the party, so this time it should prove its governance capacity by forming a government
 doosraa, modi kii hawa itani prachand he ki agar vidhansabha chunaav hue to shaayad bijepi yahaan bhi purna bahumat se sarkaar bana le
 Thirdly, the party is constantly contesting elections and how long the donors will continue to give their white money
 khaastaur se tab jab party dilli main hi haar gai or dilli kaa sabase bada voter middle class namo jaap kar rahaa ho
 Fourth, everyone is tired of constantly contesting elections, and the morale of volunteers is also declining at this time, in such a situation, the government should not go to the elections and consider their mistake
 lekin, doosraa dhada is baat se sahamat nahin he, uskaa kahana he ki agar sarkaar banaain to us naitik aadhaar kaa kya hoga jiskaa raag pichley teen maheene se sarkaar chhodane ke baad party alaap rahi thi, doosraa, congress par wo bharosa kaise kare kyonki congress ke vot bank par kabza karke aam aadmi party ne congress kaa dilli se safaya kiya he or congress kii puri koshish hogi ki kisi tarah is party ko niptaya jaae tabhi uskaa astitv bachegaa
 Thirdly, now the message of forming the government can also be known that AAP has also got the greed for power, and the fourth will be an example of the immaturity of the party by this whole development
 vaise khabar nikalate hi aap ne kaha ki sarkaar banane kaa koi sawaal hi nahin uthta to congress boli koi samarthan nahin denge
 Now, should you accept this news here? Which means Delhi people are not being formed? iske liye hamen congress kii haalat par gaur farmana padegaa She has eight mlas in the Legislative Assembly in Delhi and now she could not lead in a single Assembly seat in the Lok Sabha
 siyaasi halkon main sab is baat par sahamat hai ki dilli main phir chunaav hue to congress shaayad ek bhi seat na jeet paae kyonki loksabhaa chunaav main keval 15 fisadi voton ke saath dilli main congress apraasangik ho gai he
 That is, he has no better option than to support the Aam Aadmi Party and form his government
 vaise aam aadmi party isapar koi antim faisla nahin hua he lekin aam aadmi party koi kadam tab aage badhanaa chaahegi jab congress khud sarkaar banvaanaa chaahe or elaan kare ki dilli kii janata ke hit or bijepi ko rokane ke liye wo aam aadmi party ko samarthan dekar chaahati he ki wo ek baar phir dilli waalon se kiye vaade puure kare
 It is difficult for AAP to take the initiative on its own side as it may undermine its credibility as the party's principle refuses the alliance and the Congress itself had supported it last time
 aap ne maanga nahin tha aise main khud samarthan kaise maang le? On the other hand, the Congress is also not willing to announce on its behalf, it is wishing that the Aam Aadmi Party bow down and demand its own support
 aakhir jo bhi ho congress he to neshnal party hi na
 How to bend so easily in front of the party that drove him out of his house
 yani pehle 'aap' or pehle 'congress' kaa khel dilli main abhi chal rahaa he jo kuch din abhi or chal saktaa he
 As a journalist i cannot present my stand, but because i cover Delhi and i am a citizen isliye ye zarur kahana chahta hum is samay dilli waalon ko apni chuni hui sarkaar kii sabase zyaada jarurat he
 Summer is the shortage of water, the news of electricity disappearing for hours, more and more work is going on in Delhi
 sarkaar naa hone kii vajah se ruke hue hai or afasarshahi haaavee he
 Overall, no one in Delhi is going to listen, the government should be anyone
 


 agar hogi to koi to hoga jo samasya dur karegaa, koi to sunegaa janata kii, koi to hoga jo aashwaasan degaa ki chintaa naa karen aapkaa kaam ho jayega
 The next few days will be important for the politics of Delhi and the citizens of Delhi

 He has asked that Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash is seen walking out of the cm's residence in CCTV camera in a comfortable walk after being beaten by 11 people

 He said that the discussion on the issue of rationing had started, but instead of listening to the conversation, the Chief Secretary said that he is not accountable to them

 chhattisgarh ke raajnneetik or prashasnic galiyaaron main ek naga sadhu kii chitthee charchaa kaa vishay bani hui he
 This letter of the state DIG jail
 ke
 Has put Gupta in trouble
 darasal, naga sadhu ne chhattisgarh kii 5 central jelon main hanuman katha vaachan ke liye gupta ko chitthee likhi
 Gupta was very happy after reading this letter that this would inspire the prisoners and improve their behavior
 saath hi kaidi achche naagarik ban kar jail se reeha honge
 Gupta then allowed Naga Sadhu to jail for Hanuman Katha
 diaiji jail ne saath hi naga sadhu ko ye bhi saafe kar diya ki katha vaachan nickshulk hoga, kyonki is tarah ke kaaryakramon ke liye kisi bajet kaa praavdhaan nahin he
 But Naga Sadhu did not like this condition
 unhen jail prashasan kaa is tarah anumati dena itnaa nagavar gujara ki unhone mukhyamantri sachivalay tak kaa darwaja khatkhata diya
 Naga Sadhu has fixed a remuneration of 2
5 lakh rupees for each Hanuman Katha to be held in jail
 iske alaava ye bhi kaha he ki katha ke dauraan bhajan mandali, sangat or prasad vitaran ke liye kharch hone vaali rakam kaa bhugtan bhi jail prashasan ko karnaa hoga
 On this demand of Naga Sadhu, DIG Jail is in Gupta custody
 ek ore to vah naga sadhu ko naaraaz nahin karnaa chaahate, vahiin, duusari ore unke liye dikkat he ki ‘hanuman katha’ jaise aayojan ke liye sarkaar kii ore se bajet kaa koi praavdhaan nahin he
 The whole story started on 16 October
 madhya pradesh ke khargon jile kii samvaad tehsil ke maradaana gaanv main rahane vaale naga sadhu umeshdas nirmohi ne diaiji jail ko chitthee bheji
 In this letter, a 9-day Hanuman Katha reading was proposed in Raipur, Bilaspur, Ambikapur, Durg and Jagdalpur jails
 dakshina nahin to katha nahindiaiji jail kii ore se hanuman katha ke liye bajet naa hone kii baat kahe jane par naga sadhu nirmohi ne baqayada mukhyamantri sachivalay ko chitthee likhakar katha vaachan ke liye bajet prastaavit karne ke liye kaha he
 Naga Sadhu has written in the letter that if the demand for advance dakshina and other materials is not met, then the organization of the story will not be possible
 mukhyamantri sachivalyako chitthee main naga sadhu ne likhaa, 'main ek ankichan virakt sadhu hum
 Since the event takes place on a musical and well organized stage for three hours every day for 9 days
 sangeet ke liye kam se kam paanch kalakaar, pujan ke liye ek saathi or bhojan , vastra aadi kii do sevadaar vyavastha karte he
 Total 9 and 10 people are together, so how can their household run free? Better be a proper platform for the story in the jail premises
 mixr va mikesound kii vyavastha ho
 Every day, some officer was present during the Saptniak Puja and Aarti
 us din kaa prasad bhi usee kii taraf se vitarit ho
 There are five prisons in the state, so when, in which prison, there will be a story, a roster should be made for that
 prayek katha ke liye dhai lakh rupye bhugtan karnaa hoga
 Out of this two and a half lakh, one lakh advance payment will have to be made eight days in advance
 behatar hoga sarkaar jail main hone vaali katha ke liye ek bajet nirdhaarit kar de or use jail vibhaag ko saunp de
 'at present, the Chief Minister's Secretariat has received this letter of Naga Sadhu
 niyamon kaa koi praavdhaan nahin hone kii vajah se ye chitthee filon main kaid ho gai he
 Naga Sadhu feels that in Chhattisgarh, the BJP government is in power by winning three consecutive assembly elections, so it should have no problem in preparing the budget for the story reading
 baharhaal naga sadhu ko is hakeekat kaa nahin pataa ki rajya ke mukhyamantri raman singh aarthik sankat ke chalate kai baar dilli tak daud laga chuke hai
 Not only this, for the sake of finance management, many times, the state government has come to sell its securities

 unhone kaha, us samay main baccha tha, jab bengal main akaal ne lakhon logon ko maar daalaa tha
 i have not forgotten that suffering and sorrow
 skool jane ke liye aksar nadi tairkar paar karne vaale pranab ne jameen se uthakar kai mukaam hasil kiye or aaj antat: desh ke sarvocch naagarik ban gaye
 They were called troublemakers in the corridors of power
 prashaasak or dalon kii seemaa ke paar apni sweekaaryata ke liye vah mashhoor rahe
 He was first elected to the Rajya Sabha in 1969
 ek baar rajyasabha kii ore gaye, to kai varshon tak janata ke bich jaakar chunaav nahin ladaa
 He turned to the Lok Sabha after nearly 35 years in political life
 2004 main vah pehali baar pashchim bengal ke jangipur sansadeey kshetra se chune gaye
 He also reached the Lok Sabha in 2009
 beete 26 june ko vittamantri pad se pranab ke istipha dene ke tatkaal baad pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne unhen patr likhakar sarkaar main unke yogadan ke liye aabhaar jataayaa or kaha ki unki kami sarkaar main hameshaa mahasoos kii jaaegi
 The ministers of the government also talked about their lack
 pranab pradhanmantri banane se kai baar chuke, lekin is mahatvapurn pad par na hote hue bhi sankat ke samay sabhi log unki ore hi dekhte the
 After declaring the prime ministerial status in the 80s, he broke away from the Congress to form a new party
 baad main vah phir se congress main aae or siyaasi bulandiyon ko choote chale gaye
 Pranab Babu, who keeps a close vigil on everything from economy to foreign affairs, worked tirelessly while in government and today he is busy with his work till late night
 raajnneeti ke galiyaaron main apane fan kaa loha manwaane ke baad pranab ab desh ke sheersh sanvaidhanik pad par asin hai
 Obviously, his 45 years of experience in government and politics is unmatched
 bhale hi vah ek sthapit vakil na rahe hon, lekin samvidhan, arthvyavastha or videshi sambandhon kii apni samaj or pakad kaa loha unhone baar-baar manvaaya
 Pranab has been understanding every situation of politics very well
 yahi vajah rahi ki jab bhi unki party or maujuuda upie sarkaar par musiibat ai, to vah sabase aage najar aae
 At times it seemed that Pranab Babu is the medicine of every merger of the government
 pradhanmantri pivi narsingh raav ne 1991 main unhen videshmantri banane ke saath hi yojana ayog kaa upaadhyaksh kaa pad diya
 The comments manmohan kii sarkaar main vah rakshaamantri, videshmantri or vittamantri ke padon par rahe
 Pranab's father Kinkar Mukherjee was also a Congress leader
 kuch vakt ke liye pranah ne vakaalat bhi kii or iske saath hi patrakarita evam shiksha kshetra main bhi kuch vakt bitaayaa
 After this, his political journey started
 raashtrapati bhawan desh kaa sabase ahm pataa he, jo bharat ke pratham naagarik ke naam ke saath judaa hota he
 The grandeur of the country in which the first citizen gets the pride of living, its grandeur can be gauged from the fact that this four-storey building has 340 rooms and all the rooms are being used in one way or the other
 lagbhag do lakh varg foot main bana raashtrapati bhawan aazaadee se pehle british vysarai kaa sarkari awaas hua karata tha
 At that time 1 in the construction of this building made of 70 million bricks and 3 million cubic feet of stone
 40 karod rupee kharch hue the
 He said, i was a child at that time when a famine in Bengal killed millions
 vah pidaa or dukh main bhuulaa nahin hum
 Pranab, who often swam across the river to go to school, achieved many milestones by getting up from the ground and today finally became the highest citizen of the country
 satta ke galiyaaron main unhen sankatmochak kaha jaataa tha
 He was known for his acceptance across the border of administrators and parties
 vah pehali baar 1969 main rajyasabha ke liye chune gaye

 In 2004, he was elected for the first time from Jangipur parliamentary constituency in West Bengal
 2009 main bhi vah loksabhaa pahunche
 Immediately after Pranab resigned from the post of Finance Minister on 26 June, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wrote a letter to him thanking him for his contribution to the government and said that his lack will always be felt in the government
 sarkaar ke mantriyon ne bhi unki kami khalane kii baat kahi
 Pranab missed out on becoming the Prime Minister many times, but in spite of not being in this important post, everybody looked at him only in the time of crisis
 80 ke dashak main pradhanmantri pad kii hasarat kaa izhaar karne ke baad unhone congress se alag hokar nai party banaai
 Later he again came to the Congress and went on to touch political heights
 arthvyavastha se lekar videsh maamalon par paini pakad rakhane vaale pranab babu ne sarkaar main rahete hue kamartod mehnat kii or aaj vah der raat tak apane kaam main vyast rahete hai
 Pranab is now holding the top constitutional post of the country after getting his fun iron in the corridors of politics
 jaahir he sarkaar or raajnneeti main unke 45 saal ke anubhav kaa koi sani nahin he
 Although he may not have been an established lawyer, he repeatedly held the iron of his understanding and hold on the Constitution, economy and foreign relations
 pranab siyasat kii har karavat ko bakhubi samajhate rahe hai
 This is the reason that whenever there was trouble on his party and the current UPA government, he appeared at the forefront
 kai baar to aisa laga ki sarkaar kii har marz kii dawa pranab babu hi hai
 Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao gave him the post of Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission in 1991 along with making him Foreign Minister
 tippaniyan In Manmohan's government, he held the posts of Defense Minister, Foreign Minister and Finance Minister

 desh ke jis aaleeshaan bhawan main rahane kaa gaurav pratham naagarik ko miltaa he, uski bhavyata kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki chaar manjila is bhawan main 340 kamare hai or sabhi kamaron kaa upyog kisi na kisi rup main kiya ja rahaa he
 Rashtrapati Bhavan, built in about two lakh square feet, used to be the official residence of the British Viceroy before independence

 Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson said that it is necessary to give the death penalty early because the anesthesia given with toxic injections will end on April 30
 iske baad uske milane kii sambhaavna nahin he
 Now on April 27, another prisoner will be put to death

 The tax on the purchase of electric vehicles has now been reduced from 12 percent to 5 percent
 jiskaa phayda electric car or i-bike kharidne vaale logon ko milegaa
 But this decision of Modi government will not only benefit Indians, but it will have an impact on the whole world

 According to an International Energy Agency, to meet this target, by 2040 the world will need 600 million electric vehicles and a large proportion of these vehicles will be present in India
 tel kii khapat ke maamle main bharat, duniya main tisare number par he
 In such a situation, if the era of electric vehicles comes in India, the world economy will change

 Suppose you use a car powered by petrol
 aapaki car kaa Average 15 kilometre prati litre he or aap har roj 50 kilometre kii duuri tay karte hai to aap ek saal main kareeb 84 hajaar 350 rupye kaa petrol kharch kar denge
 But if you have an electric car, then you will spend around 1825 units of electricity in a year and it will cost 9 thousand 125 rupees per rupee per unit
 yani petrol kii car par saadhe chaar rupee prati kilometre kaa kharch aayega jabaki electric car kaa kharch 50 paise prati kilometre hoga
 In this way, you can save at least 70 thousand rupees in a year
 ye puraa hisaab petrol se chalane vaali ek choti car ke kharch par aadhaarit he
 If you drive an SUV or drive a bigger car, then your savings will be more
 yani jald hi aapako i-car market main kai vikalp milane lagenge
 Right now a large part of your salary will be spent in buying petrol and diesel
 lekin agle kuch saalon main ye keemtee tel kisi kaam kaa nahin rah jayega kyonki petrol kii keemat dhire-dhire mitti main milane vaali he
 Stanford University Report Economist Tony Seba of Stanford University has produced a report
 jiskaa sheershak he 'rethinking Transportation'
 It has been reported in this report that the entire petroleum industry will reach the end of the year 2030 as the phase of electric cars will completely change transportation
 iske liye tark die gaye hai ki aaj ke daur main petrol or dijal par chalane vaali kaaron kii Life kareeb 3 lakh kilometre hoti he
 While the life of electric cars will be 1
6 million kilometers
 is vajah se aane vaale samay main log electric kaaron ko khareednaa shuru karenge
 This change will happen because the cost on electric car will be 10 times cheaper than petrol and diesel car
 electric gadiyon main 18 se 25 Moving Parts hote hai
 Whereas, petrol and diesel powered vehicles have more than 2 thousand moving parts
 aise main Electric gaadiyaan ek tarah se Maintenance Free ho jaaengi
 According to this economist, by 2022 the range of general electric cars will cross 300 kilometers and their price will also fall
 vahiin iske baad in kaaron kii bikri badhegi
 India is also eyeing this trend and hence this time the emphasis has been on electric cars in the budget

 The discussion of the schism in Bihar Congress is in full swing nowadays, but more than that, now Lalu Prasad Yadav is running the Bihar Congress
 This came to light because a program was organized to mark the birth anniversary of the first Chief Minister of Bihar, Shri Krishna Singh, whose chief guest was RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav
 congress netaaon ko nahin pachi lalu kii salaahis kaarykram ko pradesh congress cameti ne saport kiya tha
 Speaking as the chief guest, Lalu Prasad Yadav asked the Congress leaders to stop fighting among themselves and work together for the party
 lalu yadav ne baat to acchhee kahi, lekin kuch congressi netaaon ko ye acha nahin laga
 He said that what Lalu Prasad Yadav needed was to interfere in the internal affairs of the Congress
 20 saalon se he congress main lalu kaa dakhal!haalanki ye kehane vaale shaayad ye nahin jaanate ki bihar congress main argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav kaa dakhal aaj se nahin he, balki 20 saalon se lagaataar chal rahaa he
 If past history is seen, then this has also been the main reason for the fall of Congress in Bihar
 1990 main lalu prasad yadav ne congress se ladakar usase satta chhini thi, lekin congress kii taraf se us satta ke gaurav ko paane kii ek bhi koshish in 27 saalon main nahin hui
 This is the reason why the Congress is almost paralyzed here
 27 saal pehle bihar main mukhya vipakshi dal thi congresis maamle ko samajhane ke liye hamen 27 saal pehle janaa padegaa
 In 1990, Congress lost the assembly elections in Bihar
 purv mukhyamantri dow
 The Congress was present in the Vidhan Sabha with 72 mlas as a strong opposition led by Jagannath Mishra
 lalu prasad yadav mukhyamantri the
 The period from 1990 to 1995 is considered to be a period of social change in Bihar because for the first time the participation of backward castes was abundant in power
 lalu majboot hote gaye
 
 
 Congress weak During this time, Congress did not make any effort to regain lost dignity for its progress
 is daur main dekha jaye to shuru main kamjor mukhyamantri ke taur par anke jane vaale lalu prasad yadav din pratidin majboot hote gaye or congress din prati din kamjor
 It has become a problem of weakness of the Congress that now it is in need of support to do politics in Bihar
 1995 kii vidhansabha main seat ghat kar 29 ho gai or 1996 ke loksabhaa main samta party or bijepi ke majbootee se ubharne kii vajah se loksabhaa main bhi uski haalat patali hone lagi
 When Sitaram Kesari joined hands with Lalu, in the 1996 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress was able to win only 3 out of 54 seats in Bihar
 yah party ke liye behad sharmnaak sthiti thi, lekin 1998 main congress ke adhyaksh seetaram kesari ne party kii sthiti sudhaarney ke liye lalu prasad yadav se haath mila liya
 The Congress and RJD fought the 1998 Lok Sabha elections together
 1999 main haasyaaspad hui congress kii halatsamyukt bihar kii 54 siton main lalu prasad yadav ne keval 8 siten congress ke liye chodi
 With this, the influence of Congress began to decrease rapidly
 in 8 siton main se congress ko chaar par jeet mili, lekin 1999 ke loksabhaa chunaav main to had hi ho gai jab congress ne 13 siton par chunaav ladaa, jinamein se 8 par argedy se samjhaute ke tahat or 5 par friendli ladaai hui
 But won only 2
 ab isse congress kii haalat kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa tha
 Till now Lalu Prasad Yadav was accused of fodder scam, CBI started investigation
 saal 2000 main akele ladi congresis apmanjanak sthiti ke baad congress main phir se swabhimaan jagaa or 2000 ke vidhansabha chunaav main akele chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya
 The argument was made that Lalu Prasad Yadav is corrupt and he is accused of scam
 isse pehle congress chaara ghotaale kaa aarope lagane ke baavjood 1998 or 1999 kaa loksabhaa chunaav lalu prasad yadav ke saath milakar ladi thi
 Well in the 2000 assembly elections, the Congress won 23 seats
 lalu ke bhrashtachar ko naa, rabari sarkaar main hissedaarabari devi ke netritv main sarkaar bani to congress usee sarkaar main shaamil ho gai jis par bhrashtachar kaa aarope laga kar chunaav ladaa tha
 The 2004 Lok Sabha election was fought by the Congress along with RJD and Ram Vilas Paswan, in which the Congress won 4 seats
 kendra main upie kii sarkaar bani
 But RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav dominated from Bihar
 lalu ke saath paswan bane nae saathi2005 main bihar main do baar vidhansabha ke chunaav hue lekin congress kii ranneeti dekhie usne donon baar alag alag gathbandhan se chunaav ladaa
 Once aligned with Ram Vilas Paswan's party Lok Janshakti, second time with Lalu Prasad Yadav's party RJD
 jisamen 10 siten congress ke hisse ai
 Nitish Kumar formed the NDA government in Bihar in collaboration with the BJP
 lalu or paswan ne di sirf 4 siten!uske baad kii kahani kaa kya kahana 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main upie sarkaar main rahete hue lalu prasad yadav or ramvilas paswan ne congress ko keval 4 siten di
 a little self-respecting in the Congress, he refused to take it
 congress us chunaav main akele dam utari or 2 siten jeet lee
 The Congress also contested the 2010 assembly elections when it won 4 seats
 phir 2014 main congress alaakaman ko laga ki akele chal nahin sakate
 Then Lalu Prasad joined hands with Yadav
 is baar gathbandhan ke taur par congress ko 12 siten mili jinamein 2 siton par congress ne vijay pai
 Along with the RJD Congress, Nitish Kumar's party also joined the Grand Alliance in the 2015 assembly elections, the Congress won 41 seats, then won 27 seats , the highest since 1995 
 'jab chaha, jaise chaha, congress ko istemaal kiya'ye he congress ke pichley 27 saalon kaa lekha jokha
 It is not difficult to know how much influence Lalu Prasad has had on the Congress
 lalu prasad yadav ne jab jab chaha jaise chaha congress kaa istemaal kiya
 Efforts were also made by the Congress, but due to those efforts, the Congress got exposed many times
 jaise 2000 kaa vidhaan sabha chunaav
 The Congress, which remained silent against Lalu, was the main opposition party of Bihar from 1990 to 1995, but during that time the Congress did not launch any movement against Lalu Prasad Yadav
 wo mandal kamandal ke daur main kahin ek kone main khadi rahi
 Congress did not even protest, nor announced Bihar bandh on any issue
 nateeja ye hua ki 1995 main bijepi bihar main pramukh vipaksh dal ban ke ubhari or baad main nitish kumaar ke saath satta par kabiz hui
 In such a situation, this question is absolutely meaningless that Lalu Prasad Yadav is running the Bihar Congress

 iske baad gaanv main tanaav kii sthiti ban gai
 The family has expressed suspicion over the murder of the minor on his friends and a tantrik, on which the police have started questioning some of the people in custody

 When Mulayam was invited, the left parties also started feeling that he had found a place
 or jo baat mulaayam khulkar na kah sake wo raag left ke netaaon ne alaapna shuru kar diya
 Now the difficulty of the Congress is whether they consider Mulayam as a partner or an opponent
 congress khulkar mulaayam ke khilaaf kuch nahin kah sakati kyonki wo mulaayam kii baisakhi ke sahare kii sarkaar chalaa rahi he
 The third front is making the Congress feel like a flight of imagination
 endie bhi isko zyada tool nahin de rahaa he
 The question is also being raised about this whole matter that the strategy behind this is not an attempt to fail the strategy of the stubborn stance of the bjp's PM to resign

 kapoor) on Apr 24, 2016 at 9:18 pm PDT congress netaa shashi tharur apni angreji or nae-nae angreji shabdon ko lekar surkhiyon main rahete hai
 After one of his tweets, people start finding the meaning of the words used in his tweet
 ek baar phir tharur angreji ke ek shabd ko lekar surkhiyon main aa gaye, lekin is baar wo apni galati kii vajah se yugers kaa nishaanaa bane
 In fact, he had tweeted a post in which he wrote Innovation to Innivation
 jiske baad kuch yugers ne ise nayaa shabd samaj liya or matlab dhundne lage, jabaki kai yugers ne galati ko lekar kuch mazaakia twit bhi kiye
 However, now he corrected this mistake in his own style and tweeted it after that
 unhone Innovation ke sthaan par Indovation kaa istemaal or bhi behatar mana
 He earlier tweeted this- My address to the UAE alumni of MES College of Engineering on Innivation in Indiapic

 com / v92hqytwlk— Shashi Tharoor (@shashitharoor) November 10, 2018 He then corrected this mistake and tweeted- Yes alas: That should have been "innovation" or better still, "indovation"! https: / / t

 com / v92hqytwlk — Shashi Tharoor (@shashitharoor) November 10, 2018 Also people are constantly commenting on his tweet
 isse pehle tharur ne pradhanmantrinarendra modipar likhi apni nai kitaab kaa buudhvaar ko soshal media main prachaar karte hue ek twit kiya
 Referring to his book, he used the English word 'floxinossinihilipilification', after which he started making fun of him on social media
 bahu-pratikshit bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak par buudhvaar ko rajyasabha main charchaa or matdaan kiya ja saktaa he
 In the name of 'clean Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill 2012', this bill has been passed by Lok Sabha
 loksabhaa main vidheyak ke paksh main 216 or virodh main 19 mat pade the
 The comments ek sarkari vijyapti main mangalvaar ko bataaya gaya he ki yah vidheyak teen mukhya stambhon vyapak paribhaashit prakriya ke jariye sahmati, muaavja or punarvaas par tikaa he
 Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh had assured the Lok Sabha before the passage of the bill that adequate arrangements have been made in this bill to implement the state governments according to their needs
 unhone kaha tha, "hamaari najar main yah (vidheyak) ek madhyam maarg he
 Groups are demanding different things
 yah kahana galat hoga ki hamane unase sampark nahin kiya
 " 'bhoomi adhigrahan main svachh muaavja evam paardarshita, punarvaas evam punarsthaapan vidheyak 2012' ke naam se yah vidheyak loksabhaa se paarit ho chukaa he
 The Lok Sabha had 216 votes in favor and 19 in opposition
 tippaniyan a government release said on Tuesday that the bill hinges on consent, compensation and rehabilitation through a three-pillar broadly defined process
 gramin vikaas mantri jairam ramesh ne loksabhaa ko vidheyak paarit hone ke purv aashwaasan diya tha ki is vidheyak main rajya sarkaron ko unki jaruraton ke hisaab se lagu karne kii paryaapt vyavastha kii gai he
 He had said, "in our view this (bill) is a middle way
 samooh alag-alag chizon kii maang kar rahe hai
 It would be wrong to say that we did not contact them

 " congress ke upaadhyaksh or nehru-gandhi parivaar kii rajnatik viraasat ko sanbhaalane kii koshish main jute rahul gandhi ne mangalvaar ko party ke dalit netaaon se baat kii
 During this time, the party MP and head of the SC commission was also PL Punia
 rahul ne baat kii siyasat kii, daliton kii, upi kii or is dauraan bhaiya or sistameticli shabdon par jor dekar puure system ko badalane kii baat kahi
 He said that i did not even know what caste is
 unhone kaha ki har party main mutthi bhar log tikat tay karte hai, system chalaate hai, jabaki isaki jagah lakhon hone chahie
 Comment and analysis later, what you read at the moment, Rahul Gandhi said in this speech given in Constituency Club of New Delhi, first of all i told an anecdote whenever i go to UP, i see a school, then i try to ask the children, teacher i want to talk to us vakt mayawati ji kii sarkaar thi
 So i used to have three questions
 skool main jaataa tha
 Which used to be the front line
 unke bacchon ke naam poochta tha main
 Those who used to be the back line asked the names of their children
 or jo teacher hoti thi unase do sawaal poochta tha
 Who is your topper, who is the most week student
 nabbe fisadi skool main main aapako jawaab bataa detaa hum
 In the next line, the Dalit child was never seen, which used to be the back line, more and more Dalit children were seen in it
 ye rielity he
 The teacher asks who is the topper, then the front line
 acha kaam koun nahin kar rahaa he, to peeche kii line
 Then i would ask, brother, tell me one thing that if the Dalit children are in the back line and you are telling me that there is no bright student coming out from the previous line, then there is no shortage in you, maybe you have created a category to make them Will sit next
 inako peeche
 Those who are sitting next will hear more
 puniya ji kaa kahana he ki do tarah ke skool hai
 i say there are two ways inside the school too
 ye daliton kii nahin bhedbhaav kii baat he
 200 people decide the politics of the whole country
 i have been in politics for eight years to nine years
 har state main jaataa hum, chunaav dekhtaa hum
 When our Lok Sabha, Vidhan Sabha elections are held, how many people decide
 kitne log tay karte hai ki bhaiya loksabhaa main koun jayega, vidhansabha main koun jayega, piem koun banegaa
 What is the population of India
 unamem se 60-70 fisadi log vot karte hai, takreeban 10 karod log dyside karte hai
 i also see the ticket decision, the decision to choose the candidate
 ab aap bataaie ki hundustan main sab partiyon ko jod den to kitne log honge
 You said that if you vote 10 crore, then how many people decide to choose the candidate, say it
 hindustan main, meri party main bhi, agar aapane bahut gholkar bolaa, to 100 log
 70-80 people in BJP, one person in BSP, three in SP, two in BJD
 kul system main do sau log, teen sau log, agar aapane kholkar bolaa to 500 log is desh ke rajnatik bhavishya kaa faisla lete hai
 Let me tell you straight away that by the time these 500 people decide, the voice of Dalits will not reach the Lok Sabha or the Assembly properly
 mere dimag main sawaal aata he ki upi main bispi kii sarkaar he, magar tab bhi vahaan ek vyakti chaar sau logon ko chunata he
 So the movement happened for Dalits
 sangharsh kanshiram ji ne kiya
 And then the structure closed
 kiya rajeev ko phone or pisio ke bahaane yadek samay hua karata tha jab empi or emele telephone kaa faisla lete the
 You will remember that brother used to be Kota
 ek empi kahata tha 500 logon ko ye telephone duungaa
 Parmar ji (along with a leader sitting on the stage) could not buy mobile at that time
 vidhayak ke paas haath jodakar janaa hota tha
 What changed, today this mobile phone is lying on his desk
 ye kahaan se aayaa
 PCO brought it here
 jo pehle empi emale ke haath main hota tha, usko rajeev gandhi ne pisio ke madhyam se gaanv main pahunchaaya
 When PCO came, i say that Hindustan got communication rights
 pehle ye sirf saansad or vidhayak ke paas tha
 This is happening now in the political system
 200-400 log tay karte hai candidet koun banegaa
 True political rights are neither available to the common man nor to Dalits
 chune hue kuch logon ko milti he
 The way to challenge this is in the 73rd and 74th amendments, the answer will come from here
 band kamare main hue chunavi faisle nahin chalengeham bhojan ke adhikaar kii baat karte hai, badi cheez he
 Employment planning is a big thing
 artiai de diya
 Ask all political parties
 aap apni party main raajnneetik haq kisko dete ho
 You decide the ticket, who has the rights
 koi bhi party aapako iskaa jawaab nahin de sakati
 Not a party in India, if we have to take politics into the 21st century, then it has to take 200 to 500, 1000 and then one lakh
 band kamare jahaan tikat disijan ho rahe hai, inhen kholana he
 This is the main thing, everything else is on the periphery
 jab tak ye daravaaje nahin khulenge, tab tak sachmuch raajnneetik haq nahin milegaa
 i want to focus a bit on Dalit, when the system is shut down, the most pressure falls on the weakest
 jo taqatvar he wo band system main ghuskar bhi apana rasta nikaal saktaa he, magar jo aisa nahin he, uske liye bahut mushkil ho jaataa he
 There is no talk of caste in my family
 i do not believe in caste
 kyonki meri soch he ki vyakti ek hote hai
 There was no talk of caste in my family before
 maaloom hi nahin tha mujhe
 Because everybody was the same for my grandmother, for my father, for my great grandfather
 unki soch ye thi ki bhai vyakti hota he, uski kshamta hoti he, daliton main ye hoti he, baaki logon main hoti he, koi fark nahin padataa
 The reality is that in Dalits, in OBC, there is no difference in capacity
 isliye kahani bataai wo skool kii
 In that, you are giving the child an unfair treatment
 peeche baitha diya he
 Then later they are saying that it is not able to read properly
 phir kah rahe ki rigelt thik nahin aa rahaa
 So i say what i see lacking
 har level par dalit leadership chahie
 In UP, tell me the names of five Dalits who are leaders
 mujhe ek hi naam sunai detaa he
 Mayawati ji 
 
 doosraa naam hi nahin sunai detaa
 If we talk about UP, then there will be a line
 is block main ye netaa he
 These are the dozen leaders in this district
 is gaanv main ye hai
 We give them systematic rights
 agar aap panchayat main kaam karte ho or congress main ho to aapako ye adhikaar milenge
 Not that i thought Poonia ji was doing a good job, so she moved forward
 mujhe laga diya ki koi or kaam nahin kar rahaa to peeche kar diya
 This causes damage, unless you lift it from the bottom, it is not going to happen
 jo bhi main system kii baat karata hum, meri soch he ki ham adhikaar kii baat karen, political netaa he, kaam karata he, disijan main isaki kya aawaaj he
 Systematically
 to ye main aahiste aahiste karne kii koshish kar rahaa hum
 Earlier, Dalits used to support the Congress and you should be Dalit Leadership, Capable People
 or main abhi congress kii baat karun
 So systematically your voice does not come in the Congress, it comes one by one, you talked to someone
 kaaphi senior netaa baithe hai, magar institutionalee nahin aati
 i want you to come on the basis of the community, not on the individual country
 phir aapako sachmuch main aapkaa jo power he, uskaa phayda hoga or jo dalit varg he, unako pataa lagegaa ki bhaiya yahaan par baat suni ja rahi he, sunwaayee ho rahi he
 15-20, 25 years, Paheli supported the Congress Party by pressing the Dalit class
 bakabon hota tha congress kii, main chahta hum ki aaj se 5-8 saal baad phir dalit ye feel kare ki ham congress party kii bakabon hai
 And to feel it, we don't have to change, we have to change
 ham unako ye kabhi nahin samajha paaenge ki bhaiya aap hamaari bakabon ho
 If in our judgment, they are not really backbone in the organization
 ye kaam main sirf daliton ke liye nahin karnaa chahta
 i am a weak community
 dekhie daliton kii baat hoti he, yahaan ek dalit mahila baithi he
 They have a distinction of Dalit, then of a woman, then double
 pachaas fisadi mahilaayein, wo bhi vanchit tabake se hai
 So i think that which is weak
 unako ham jodakar unki aawaaj loksabhaa main, vidhansabha main daalen, sistameticli, ye meri koshish he

 tabhi to dakshin africa ke purv captain greem smith ne khulkar kaha he ki dakshin africa ke bhartiya daure ko lekar wo 'nervas' hai or maanate hai ki protiyaaj ke saamne chunauti aasaan nahin he
 The gesture of former captain Graeme Smith before the gandhi-mandela cricket series, starting on October 2, may excite the Indian team
 haalanki smith kii baton kaa ek matlab yah bhi he ki dakshin africa team bhartiya team ko halkaa nahin aank rahi or is daure ke liye alag taiyaari ke saath aegi
 Perhaps this is the reason why South Africa has leaked three spinners in their team
 leg spinner imran taahir (16 test-43 wicket), of spinner den pit (1 test-8 wicket or 52 first class maichon main 183 wicket) or of spinner simon harmar (3 test-10 wicket, 66 first class- 242 wicket) bhartiya pichon kaa phayda uthaakar apni team ke hero sabit ho sakate hai
 But these three spinners also do not have experience of 25 Tests in total

 In order to identify any danger, two such 'security cycles' have been prepared in the family of the intelligence wing of Rajasthan Police which will quickly detect any nefarious designs
 rajasthan main piem modi or amit ke daure yaa siem vasundhara raaje ke helicopter kii suraksha jaise morchon par mustaidi ke saath rajasthan police kii intelligence shakha main 'warner or maaya' ko hi tainaat kiya jaataa he
 The special thing is that only Rajasthan Police Intelligence has dogs like 'warner and Maya' in the state police all over the country
 viipi ke liye 'suraksha chakra' hai beagal brid ke dogsmahaj ek saal ke warner or maaya chandigarh ke panchkula main ITBP se apni training puri karne ke baad rajasthan police kii intelligence shakha main bhartee hue hai
 We are talking about the Beagle Breed Kedogsky being used by the US and Russia police
 desh main pehali baar sirf rajasthan police kii intelligence shakha ne is brid ke ek jode ke saath ye prayog kiya he 
 Who have recently introduced a strong security cycle in all major celebrations and VIP movements in Rajasthan
 kisi bhi visphot ko soonghney kii acchhee kshamtarajasthan intelligence ke dog handler shriprakash yadav kaa kahana he ki hamane apane jivan main bahut saradoghandle kiye hai, lekin soonghney or pakadaney kii aisi kshamta hamane ab tak kisi kii bhi nahin dekhi
 The specialty of these dogs of beagle breed is that they are very small in size
 jiskaa phayda VIP,VVIP movement main flite kii sits ke neeche yaa gaadi kii seat ke neeche aasaani se search hoti he
 Also, the breed has a good ability to smell any explosive
 mukhya dog handler tejprakash kaa kahana he ki duniya main smart dogs kii jo shrenee abhi tak tay kii gai hai, usamen beagal tisare number par aata he
 Breeds that come in number 1 and 2 do not fit according to the Rajasthan weather

 The hallmark of why criminals are uncontrollable here
 ravivaar subah ek marij home main dance kaarykram kaa udghaatan karne ke liye kama thane ke prabharee rakesh yadav ko aamantrit kiya gaya tha
 It is said that if the girls danced on pornographic songs here, the policemen also beat them fiercely
 is kaarykram main camera yaa mobile le jane kii ijaajat kisi ko nahin di gai thi
 The police station in-charge and the rest of the police reached the limit when they also danced to loud tunes in the police station at night
 lagata he ki un ke sir se subah ke kaarykram kaa khumaar raat tak nahin utraa tha
 Now the question arises here that in the area where the police station in-charge and the policemen have this kind of attitude, then how can they be accused of crimes
 ashleel dance or gaanon ke kaarykram ke virodh main hindu sanghathan ke kaaryakartaaon ne raily nikaali or tehseeldaar ko gyaapan saunpa
 He has warned that if the program is not stopped, there will be more protests
 mevaat kshetra main aparaadh kaa graph ooncha hone kii vajah se log din main bhi khud ko surakshit nahin samajhate hai
 At the police station, dancing in the fun of the policemen itself tells the whole story

 He risked satire for this
 unhone yah bhi saaf kiya ki yah film pakistan yaa kisi bhi desh ke khilaaf nahin balki sarhad par ladaai ke khilaaf he
 Faraj claims that no such film has been made between the two countries before this
 faraj ne kaha ki kisi bhi nae nirdeshak ke liye alag tarah kii film bananaa jaruri he
 In the film on India and Pakistan, it was necessary to have a different subject anyway because many films of sensitive and emotional type have been made on the conflict between the two countries
 lekin is baar jang par nai tarah kii film dekhne ko milegi
 He said that there was also a risk in making the film because the sensitive and technical aspects of international relations and military also had to be taken care of

 Actress Shweta Tripathi, who came into the discussion due to her excellent performance in the film 'masaan', said that she should never add Fairness Cream
 unka kahana he ki vah industry main acha kaam karnaa chaahati hai
 Shweta will soon be seen opposite Nawazuddin Siddiqui in the film 'haramkhor'
 ajtak se khaas baatcheet main shweta ne apane bare main kai dilachasp baaten bataayin
 Has there been any change in your life with the film 'masaan'? i love acting very much
 log bas ab naam jaan gaye hai
 Nothing much has changed
 kis tarah se 'masaan' mili aapako?mujhe filmein to kerani hi thi, industry main kisi ko nahin jaanati thi, tivi par disni kaa ek sho kiya, phir casting main gai, aid shoot bhi kiya, play produs kiye, casting ke dauraan ek film main assitant diarector kaa kaam bhi kiya jise anuraag kashyap ne line produs kiya tha
 So after that i started staying in Anurag Kashyap's office and i got 'haramkhor' and Neeraj Ghewan's 'masaan' with Nawazuddin Siddiqui
 donon diarectors ne mere liye yah kirdaar likhe
 When 'masaan' was selected for Cannes Film Festival, it seemed that the film would win the award? One morning i got up and Neeraj's message came that we were selected at Cannes Film Festival
 main itani khush ho gai thi ki sab kuch ajeeb sa lag rahaa tha
 Once we went to Cannes Festival the dream came true
 bahut hi adbhut anubhav tha
 Will i do TV again? No, i worked with Disney, but if things get old on TV soon, i won't do TV just for money
 kehete hai paisa achche-acchon ko badal detaa he
 See, i will wait for good work, i will never do work like Fairness Cream Ed
 bhale hi thodaa intjaar karnaa pade lekin acha kaam hi karongi
 What was the reaction of the parents after 'masan'? My father is an IS officer, mother is a teacher, i am alone in Mumbai for the last eight years
 ghar vaale dilli main hai
 He said, do something other than acting
 ab gharavaalon se kaaphi saport he
 After 'masaan', the householders feel proud and there was no pressure for marriage
 tip cast ho jane se dar lagata he?ji bilkul
 Like my dream role is to play Mafia Queen
 ab 'masaan' ke baad 'haramkhor' kar rahi hum, or uske baad kuch alag hi karongi
 So scared of being cast type
 apane bare main bataaen?dilli kii ladki hum, mumbai aakar magazine ke liye kaam kiya, theatre kiya, diarector ke saath kaam kiya
 i had to act phir maine trailor department main kaam karnaa shuru kiya, phir aid shoot karti thi, phir disni ke sho ke liye kaam aayaa or maine kiya uske baad films karne lagi
 Are you a fan of Bollywood's Khan? i want to work with all of Bollywood's Khans
 aamir kii alag style he, salmaan or shahrukh ke saath bhi kaam karne main kaaphi acha lagegaa
 Also, Saif Ali Khan's 'ek Hasina Thi' movie was also very good
 kya kabhi item sang karengi?jahaan bhi kising yaa sex ke seen ko film bechney ke liye prayog kiya jayega, to main waisi filmein nahin karongi
 i would not like to do anything that my parents would raise questions about
 agar script demand kare to kya aap on screen neudity par jaaengi?wo diarector par nirbhar karata he, agar 'bandit queen' jaisi film he to jarur karongi
 If there is a good reason, i will definitely do it

 Determined to be the responsibility of the school, most of the families say that it is usually seen that the school only takes responsibility for the safety of children inside the campus
 aise main skool aate vakt yaa chuttee hote vakt bachche sadak paar karke jate hai or suraksha ko lekar laaparvaahee dekhi jaati he
 In such a situation, the school administration will have to be aware of the safety of children even outside the school gate

 In many vans, 12 to 14 children were seen
 suraksha ko lekar laaparvaahee itani zyada he ki bacchon ko sienji silendar ke upar tak baitha diya jaataa he
 The school administration says that this van has been installed by the family members themselves, so the school is not responsible for it

 The Indian Army is very capable

 Singh said that there are many reasons why people do not understand why this is so
 israel jaise desh hi nateezon kii parvaah nahin karte hue kuch chijen kar sakate hai

 In such a situation, the lead Congress, taken in Parliament on the note closure of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, now looks lost
 yahi vajah he ki is sammelan ke jariye vah khud ko janata ke saamne sabase prabal vipaksh ke taur par pesh karnaa chaahati he
 This conference, which is being seen as a show of strength, is being held at the Talkatora Stadium in Delhi

 do dinon tak chalane vaala 13waan india today conklev shuukravaar ko nai dilli main shuru ho gaya
 The conclave began with a speech by Arun Puri, chairman and editor-in-chief of India Today Group
 unhone maujuuda raajnneetik maahaul, aarthik chunautiyon or usamen conklev kii ahmiyat or praasangikta par baat kii or kaarykram main sabakaa swaagat kiya
 Ladies and gentlemen of Arun Puri, good morning, i stand before you at a time when the wind is blowing like lightning
 7 april se duniya kaa sabase bada loktantric chunaav shuru ho rahaa he
 Eighty-five million people will use their franchise
 jinamein 1
 5 crore will be the first time youth to vote
 1977 main indira gandhi ke emergency hataane ke baad yah sabase utsaahi chunaav hone vaale hai
 Will a stable government be formed? Will the economy be back on track? Will anyone be able to instill fear of God within the corrupt? Will communalism increase or decrease? Many such questions are in front of us
 lekin desh ko 16 may ko nattejey aane tak intjaar karnaa hoga
 At such an exciting time, i welcome you to the 13th India Today Conclave
 12 saal pehle india today kii 12veen saalagirah par hamane yah conklev shuru kiya tha
 Since then it has created a special identity among the people
 duniya ke is hisse main yah apni tarah kaa sabase bada soch or vichaar kaa kaarykram ban chukaa he
 Even before this, people from different regions have been participating in the conclave
 is baar bhi agle do din tak ham sabhi vaktaaon kii baat puri dilchaspee se sunanaa chahenge
 i welcome them all
 hamen pataa he ki yah aam chunaav kaa vakt he, lihaaja hamane apana theme rakhaa he, 'jeet'
 So this time the focus of the Conclave will be on looking towards the future
 pichley saal gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi hamaare gaala nite spikar the
 He is now the bjp's prime ministerial candidate
 aagaamee aam chunaav main unka palada baari bataaya ja rahaa he
 The Congress party has dominated in the last elections
 is baar chunaav modi virdohi or modi samarthakon ke bich bant gaya he
 There is no question of BJP
 balki modi apni party par bhi haaavee ho gaye hai
 Even the role of regional parties is being categorized as 'pro-modi' and 'anti-modi'
 lambey samay baad chunaav se pehle ek vikalp saaf najar aa rahaa he
 This is similar to March 1977, when Indira Gandhi was a central figure and equally controversial
 isi tathy ne chunaav ko dilachasp bana diya tha
 Regarding the present India, i think it is a hungry look
 bhookha matlab, bhojan kaa bhookha nahin
 If we can deliver properly, then there is so much food here that no one will sleep hungry
 ham bhukhe hai to puunji ke, tarakkee ke, urja, shiksha or avasaron
 And above all, we are hungry for a clear strong and honest leadership
 ham bediyon se aaazaad hone ke liye ji-tod mehnat kar rahe hai
 We need a leader who can bring everyone together and shape the political capabilities of the country
 desh kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan sab jaanate hai
 We should just focus on solving them without discrimination
 aap jaanate hai ki ham is muhane par isliye khadey hai kyonki pichley kuch saal sarkaar, vyapaar or loktantr ke liye bure sapane kii tarah rahe hai
 For the first time in 25 years, the economy remained at 5 per cent for two consecutive years
 utpaadakta ke lihaaj se yah sabase kharaab loksabhaa rahi
 It used 63 percent of the total time and left 74 bill pending
 iske alaava, telecom, kaamanwealth or koyala se lekar raksha saamagree tak, yah sarkaar ghotaalon main ghiri rahane ke liye bhi jaani jaaegi
 Caught in crony capitalism, India ranks 94th in Corruption Perception Index
 is maamle main ham brazil, china, burkina phaso or malawi se bhi peeche hai
 i feel sad to say that corruption has permeated almost every aspect of our lives and has engulfed our beloved sports cricket
 isane karpshan ko chunaav kaa sabase bada mudda bana diya
 i am happy with it
 kyonki jo bhi satta main aayega, is 'cancer' se nibatane ke liye use gambhir koshishen kerani hi hongi
 In a few hours, CBI director Ranjit Sinha will be present here, who investigated several big scams
 aise samay main jab supreme court sibiai ko 'pinjre kaa tota' kah chukaa ho, yah kaam nishchit rup se mushkil hoga
 We will learn from them what is the life inside the cage
 lokapal bill kii baat ko bhi sibiai kii aazaadee ke sawaal se hi nayaa aayam mila
 Unfortunately, there is little focus on building or fixing infrastructure
 ghate main chal rahi public sector kii companiyaan sarkari khajaane ko sokhe ja rahi hai
 We have no way to make our 'lazy' bureaucracy employing 50 lakh people more effective
 kuch hi der main purv kendriya mantri arun shouri is mudde par baat karenge
 Another problem that is bringing the economy down is the populist schemes being announced in the wake of elections
 har saal hajaaron karod aisi yojanaon main kharch ho jate hai or jaruratmandon tak phir bhi suvidhaayen nahin pahunchatin
 As India moves forward, it must decide what it wants, high growth or high donations
 is par baat karne ke liye do bade arthshaastri hamaare saath honge
 In the dictatorship of corruption, leaders and bureaucrats are imposing restrictions on trade from all sides
 prakritik sansadhano ke aavanton par ham license raaj kii taraf laut rahe hai
 We need high growth rates and employment opportunities for India to be able to dominate in the next decade
 kendriya vaanijya mantri is par baat karne ke liye hamaare saath honge
 i am happy that despite the election campaign, some top leaders from across the country are also participating in the Conclave
 ham madhya pradesh, rajasthan or jammu-kashmir ke mukhyamantriyon se mukhaatib honge
 Indian politics is in a phase of great change
 puraane votbank kaate-chhante ja rahe hai
 Our growing middle class is emerging as a major power, which is above caste politics
 bharat ke log apane netaaon se or bhi bahut kuch chaahate hai
 Apart from religious mobilization and caste equations, they worry about jobs, opportunities, roads, electricity, water and home
 haal hi main paanch vidhansabha chunaavon ne yah sabit kiya
 Chief ministers with a development agenda were given another chance in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, while leaders promising change were elected in Rajasthan and Delhi
 ham bhartiya raajnneeti ke is nae trend par apane mehmaanon se charchaa karenge
 In the next two days you will have Union Ministers, Chief Ministers and senior leaders from parties across the country
 hamaara pehla seshan uttar pradesh ke yuva mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke saath he
 We will also have those with us today, due to which leaders are trying to change themselves anew
 vah hai dilli ke purv mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal
 He has caught the attention of people across the country due to his anti-corruption and vote bank politics and transparency in elections
 unki satta ke uthal-puthal bhare 49 din kitne safal rahe, vah bahes kaa vishay he
 But they have had a profound impact on the politics of the current era
 partiyon ke bheetar ummidavaaron or chunaav fund kii jabardast chantni hone lagi he
 But we must also not forget that 'victory' is not achieved without the hero
 bharat ke superstar or bollywood ke hit mashin salmaan khan hamaare gaala dinar spikar honge
 He is a tremendous entertainer and a universal brother
 lijendry actor amitabh bachchan bhi hamaare saath honge
 He began his journey with the image of an angry young man in 1970, shortly before the India Today group
 aaj 71 saal kii umr main bhi vah sabase pasandida or praasangik abhinayta bane hue hai
 i am very happy to say that France will be our partner country in this program
 jab france hamaare saath jude hai to khaanaa bhi isse achoota nahin rahegaa
 We will be accompanied by Master Pastry Chef Pierre Herms who is famous as 'picasso of Pastry'
 saath hi hamaare saath france ke top rocket vaigyanik honge
 Together we will have our famous nuclear experts
 donon hi bade praasangik vishay hai
 In the next two days, 48 speakers will speak on issues ranging from politics and robotics to the toilet versus the temple
 mujhe yakeen he ki ve aapako jaankaree denge, manoranjan karenge or in sabase badhkar aapke saamne chunautiyaan rakhenge
 Enjoy the Conclave

 Here a BA student sketched her before Suicide
 chaatra ne apni faansee par latakane ke anubhav ke liye pehle ek-ek kar teen sketch banaakar samajha or phir uske baad wo pankhe se latak gai
 He found it more right to hang from the fan through the skate and he got suicide by hanging from the fan
 is chaatra ko naa to koi tension thi naa koi beemaari naa hi koi afaire
 She also wrote in the suicide note that i am doing suicide as i wish
 ab chaatra ke parivaar se lekar police tak sab uske sketch banaakar suicide karne se hairaan hai
 When the student created three sketches, Mohani made three similar sketches one by one before the suicide
 ek main usne khud ko angan kii jaali se latakta dikhaaya tha, duusare main diwaal se latakta or tisare main kamare ke pankhe se latakta
 Before making these three sketches, he experienced how it would be nice to hang
 aakhir use pankhe se latakana intrested laga or phir usne pankhe se latak kar faansee laga lee
 The people of Mohini's house are unable to understand why Mohini hanged, then why did the first division pass in the inter-student's student is supervisor in a company
 mohani ke do bhai or do bahan thim
 Every comfort facility was present in the house
 vah inter main first divijan paas hui thi
 At this time she was a student of BA Third Air
 uskaa koi najdiki dost bhi nahin tha
 Before this, he had never made any sketch of this kind
 tabhi ghar vaale bas yahi afsos kar rahe ki agar koi kami hoti tab aisa kadam uthaati to bhi thik hota sab suvidhaon ke baad suicide usne kyon kiya
 The second case that came up in 15 days is the second case of such a suicide in Kanpur within fifteen days
 abhi ek may ko hi inter kii chaatra anoushka singh ne keval romaanch or kuch nayaa karne kii chahat main suicide kar hadakamp machaa diya tha

 Kader Khan passes away kadar khan ne bollywood kii kareeb 250 filmon ke samvaad likhe, 300 filmon main kaam kiya
 But Kadar got his first big fame from 'roti'
 haalanki is film main kadar khan ko kaam milanaa aasaan nahin tha
 In an interview, Kader Khan told the entire story of how Manmohan Desai, the Hindi cinema's heroine, first showed him the way out and then sat on his eyes
 desai us vakt bollywood ke shoman kahe jate the
 Kader Khan had told in the interview, "my producer, Habib Nadiadwala introduced me to Manmohan Desai
 manmohan ji us daur main kaaphi pareshaan chal rahe the
 The reason for this was that he was making the film Roti, but he was not getting frozen even as he was writing its dialogues
 is vajah se habib nadiadwala ne mujhe manmohan desai se milwaaya
 "the film Roti has changed the fate of Kader Khan, Manmohan Desai said," Hey, remove him (kader Khan) man, i have tried many Mian brothers
 " manmohan desai ne mujhase kaha, "dekho miyaan mujhe dialog acha lagegaa to lene kii soch saktaa hum
 Otherwise i will tear the form in front of you
 "tab maine kaha, "aapane ye to bataa diya ki bura lagegaa to kya karenge, lekin ye nahin bataaya ki acha laga to kya hoga
 "then Manmohan Ji said," i will dance on my head when you feel good
 "unhen film pasand ai or unhone mujhe sir par rakhaa
 Kadar Khan used to get beaten up at school because of the children, he had to leave this work, how did Kamadhar Khan in Manmohan desai-prakash Mehra Camp told in an interview, "manmohan used to work with Desai at that time
 us vakt prakaash mehara bhi filmein banaate the
 They also needed me
 lekin ye donon apojishan camp the
 It was impossible to work together in both camps at that time
 jo ek camp main kaam karata tha wo duusare main kaam nahin kar saktaa tha
 But i was the only one who would work with both
 ""meri vajah se amitabh bachchan bhi kaam kar lete the
 People used to ask me how both of you work in the camp
 aap kiski camp main hai
 Then i used to answer that both (manmohan desai-prakash Mehra) work in my camp
 main unki camp main kaam nahin karata hum
 "needless to say that Manmohan Desai and Prakash Mehra made more than one blockbuster in Hindi cinema in the 70s and 80s
 in filmon ne amitabh ko lokapriyata or mahanayake kaa darja de diya
 # kaderkhansaab was one of the finest actors of our country
 It was a joy and a learning experience to be on the sets with him
