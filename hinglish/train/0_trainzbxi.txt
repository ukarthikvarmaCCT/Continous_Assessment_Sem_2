 Indian ODI captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has said that after losing two consecutive odis against Bangladesh, he is ready to play as a player, leaving the captaincy of the ODI team
 lekin sabase ahm sawaal ye he ki kya bataur player dhoni kii team main jagah banati he
 Dhoni, as a batsman and wicketkeeper, has been out of form for some time
 bangladesh ke khilaaf do vanade match main dhoni ke saamne mauka tha ki ve ballebaazi main apana kamaal dikhaa saken, lekin donon maichon main dhoni balle se sangharsh karte najar aae, unhone ran jarur banaae, lekin apni pari ko badi pari main tabdeel nahin kar sake
 In the second ODI, he came out to bat at number four and also scored 47 runs, but the old Dhoni could not be seen
 kabhi vanade cricket ke best finishr maane jane vaale dhoni ne aakhri baar match jeetne vaali pari july, 2013 main triangular series ke final muqaabale main westeindies ke khilaaf kheli thi 52 gendon par note 45 ran
 He has not played any match-winning innings in the last 38 odis
 beete do saal main agar ballebaazi ke nazariye se dekhen to dhoni keval ek shatak bana paae hai
 Especially his batting has been very weak for the last one year
 ek saal ke dauraan unhone 21 vanade maichon main mahaj 505 ran banaae
 During this time he has made 21 catches and 5 stumps in 21 matches
 dhoni kii umr bhi 34 saal ho chuki he
 On the other hand, there are cricketers like Wriddhiman Saha, Dinesh Karthik and Robin Uthappa to replace him as wicketkeeper-batsman
 jaahir ki in cricketron main dhoni jaise midas tach or cricket kii samaj nahin he
 In such a situation, Dhoni can now remain in Team India for a year or two, but only as an ODI captain and not as a player
 vaise ateet main captaini chhodkar sachin tendulkar, rahul dravid or saurav ganguli team india main shaamil jarur rahe, lekin tendulkar ke alaava dravid or ganguli jaise cricketron kaa kariyar captaini se hatane ke baad utaar-chadhaav bharaa rahaa
 In such a situation, Dhoni himself is taking the trouble by making statements like stepping down from the captaincy, but the name of the problems to overcome and overcome him is Mahendra Singh Dhoni

 The contribution of the iron man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in giving India a monolithic form after independence cannot be forgotten and it is believed that patient and visionary leadership like him could have united India divided into small princely states

 The BJP has thrown a new dice to trap Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi
 bijepi ne kaha he ki agar arvind kejariwal main himmat he, to jagadish mukhi ke khilaaf chunaav ladakar dikhaaen
 After the meeting of the state BJP leaders with BJP national president Amit Shah, BJP national secretary and senior BJP leader RP Singh told NDTV India, "he proclaims our CM candidate on our behalf, if he has only declared And fought against previous CM Sheila Dixit
 
 
 desh ke piem candidet ke khilaaf lade the, to jo unheen kii taraf se ghoshit he, uske khilaaf lard len jaakar
 
 
 " maamla yah he ki dilli me bijepi koi siem ummidavaar ke bina hi modi ke chehre ko aage rakhkar chunaav lard rahi he, jabaki aam aadmi party apni taraf se jagadish mukhi ko bijepi kaa siem candidet bataakar kejariwal (aap ke siem candidet) se muqabla project karne main juty he or kyonki kejariwal lokapriyata ke maamle main kejariwal, mukhi se aage maane jate hai, isliye bijepi ko dar he ki muqabla mukhi banaam kejariwal hone par party ko nuksaan ho saktaa he
 The bjp's bet is that Kejriwal be implicated in his web
 jagadish mukhi janakapuri vidhansabha seat se 1993 se vidhayak hai, isliye ye seat bijepi kii ghar kii seat maani jaati he
 The party did not lose this seat in the worst of times
 kejariwal janakapuri jaaenge yaa nahin pataa nahin, lekin nai dilli seat chhodane par ek baar phir 'bhagoda' kaa label lag saktaa he or yah koi gambhir raajnneeti bhi nahin maani jaati, kyonki nai dilli seat par kejariwal ne pichley saal tatkaaleen mukhyamantri shila dikshit ko unke garh main hi karaari shikast di thi
 In such a situation, how will Kejriwal leave New Delhi? And how will we defeat BJP in its stronghold? Because there was 15 years of anti-incumbency and anti-congress atmosphere while defeating Sheila Dixit, while there is a Modi name wave with BJP, the Aam Aadmi Party itself is being saved from colliding
 aam aadmi party ke netaa sanjay singh ne javaabi hamalaa karte hue kaha ki jab shila dikshit siem thim, to arvind kejariwal unke khilaaf lade the, to ab arvind ke baad to koi siem hua nahin, isliye ab kejariwal ke khilaaf jagadish mukhi chunaav laden
 Sanjay Singh said that i welcome Jagdish Mukhi, he should come and contest elections and discharge this tradition
 yah dilli chunaav se pehle kii siyaasi pantarebaaji he, jo is baat kaa ishaara jarur karti he ki dilli vidhansabha chunaav behad joardaar honge

 Rakhshanda Jaleel (literary historian and author of Like Preaching, Loving Change: a History of the Progressive Writers Movement in Urdu) is a Muslim by birth and i was raised as a Momin
 jab bhi log bahari rup jaise dadhi yaa burke ke saath deen ko jodgaye lagate hai to mujh par gaharaa asar padataa he
 i also get upset with the trend when people do not want to debate things that question the ostentatious link between true religion and adherence to certain beliefs
 main khud se puuchhati hum ki kya isaki vajah yah he ki musalmaan bahes or uske jariye uthne vaale vaastavik muddon se darate hai?da colected works of mahatma gandhi ko dobaaraa padhate samay mujhe ek baat yaad ai
 There has been mention in many places about the curtain and its observance
 may 1947 main fatehpur main ek sabha main gandhiji ne kaha, "sachcha paradaa dil kaa hona chahie
 What does external burqa mean? i say that there is no mention of external screen in Quran Sharif
 ham kitni teji se aage bad rahe hai
 
 
 At such a time, what is the rationale for continuing the banal customs like purdah? ”we have indeed made progress, but the customs are still following us
 sthiti or bhi kharaab hoti chali gai he, kyonki kal tak jo mote taur par saamaajik rivaaj tha, aaj dharmik baadhyataa ban gaya he
 Gandhiji correctly mentioned that there is no mention of the burqa in the Holy Quran
 quran ne shaleenta or pavitrataa kii raksha ke liye jin baton ke paalan par jor diya he ve purushon or mahilaon par samaan rup se lagu hai
 But with the passage of time, the custom was imposed on the women and they were pushed from the head to the foot by the decree of being covered in a burqa
 sheel kii raksha ke naam par thamaaye gaye burke ko dharmik pahchaan ke saath jodgaye kii baat kahin se sahi nahin lagati
 Similarly, it is also not fair to call Muslims, especially women, ill-treated, or justify their behavior, who deny the burqa, claiming that it has nothing to do with religion
 sachaai yah he ki dharm kaa dhindhora peetane waalon ke paas in betuki manyataon ko prachlit karaane ke liye pavitra quran yaa sharia main likhi baton kaa pramaan nahin he
 Who are these religious officials who want to dominate not only the beliefs and traditions of Muslim religion, but also their customs and rituals? In India, in the absence of strong leadership and Islamic religious leaders, there are so-called clerics and imams among Muslims who are not well educated and who have no understanding of the modern world
 muslim madhyam varg apane samudaay ke muddon se udasin, roji-roti ke sangharsh main uljhe mullaon ke adhakachare nazariye par sawaal uthaane se darataa he
 This imposes taboo on women like education, special curriculum, separate school for girls reaching adolescence
 gandhi ke shabd aaj bhi utane hi sachche hai
 The outer curtain is very bad, but the curtain is worse than the wisdom
 main saidhantik taur par maanati hum ki jo alag he, vah swaabhaavik taur par asmaan he

 ' Shocked and disturbed walking in the campus of Delhi University, these children are unable to understand what lessons their upcoming university is teaching them before graduation
 But is this the biggest question of our higher education, is the graduation for three years or four years? jin vishvavidhyalayon ko acha manushya gadhane kii prayogshaala hona chahie, unhen kushal mashine gadhane ke kaarkaanon main badla ja rahaa he
 The aim of education should be to be a better human being, to understand life better, to create a deeper concern with society and to develop such an experimental vision, which can give something new to the country and the world from thought to technology
 lekin hamaare yahaan acchhee shiksha kaa matlab acchhee naukariyon vaali shiksha rah gaya he or acchhee naukari kaa matlab acha paisa bhar rah gaya he
 The logic of neither living nor left is to read - everything is being weighed with jobs and money
 aise main vishvavidhyalayon kii vah garima hi nahin bachi he, jo nayaa samaaj gadhane vaale kisi santhaan kii honi chahie
 The University of Delhi has done the same in its attempt to commercialize
 pichley saal agar kulapati ne shikshakon kaa maan nahin rakhaa to is saal ujisi ne kulapati kaa maan nahin rakhaa
 The truth is that the UGC has not even kept its promise
 beete saal vah diu kii swaittata kaa hawala detii rahi is saal kulapati ko kinare kar sidhe principalon ko chitthee likhti dikhaai padi
 The question of autonomy of institutions was left behind
 lekin dilli vishvavidhyalay kii is swaittata par hamalaa isliye sambhav hua ki vah bheetar se jarjar hota santhaan he
 This truth is not only about DU but of our entire education world
 aakhir itane saare aai
 I
 tii or aai
 I
 em banane ke baad bhi pichley pachaas saal main ham ek nobel vijeta vaigyanik paidaa nahin kar paae− bas kushal takanisian hi banaate rah gaye

 Most of the companies have given appraisals to their employees
 vahiin kuch karmiyon ko acha aprijal mila hoga or kuch ko aprijal nahin mila
 If you are one of them, whose appraisal did not go well, do not get discouraged nor reduce your spirit of work
 kharaab aprijal ke baad aapako kya karnaa chahie yahaan padhein
 
 
 If you keep stuffing at work, you must have heard that if you get something easily, then you will not be able to respect it
 jo hota he achche ke liye hota he
 Not getting appraisal is a sign of this that you can refine yourself

 loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ke ashwamedh kaa rath rokane or apane siyaasi vajood ko dobaaraa paane se liye basapa adhyaksh mayawati ne sapa se sari dushmani bhulaakar haath milaayaa
 Despite this, the SP-BSP alliance has completely collapsed in the fierce wave of Narendra Modi
 is karaari haar ke baad sapa main manthan kaa daur shuru ho gaya he
 At the same time, Mayawati is sitting silently and is not in the mood to churn to review the defeat
 uttar pradesh kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se bijepi gathbandhan soobe main 64 siton ke saath vaapasi kii he
 BJP 62 and its ally Apna Dal managed to win 2 seats
 jabaki duusari ore sapa-basapa gathbandhan ko mahaj 15 siten hi jeet saki he
 Of these, BSP has got 10 seats and SP has got 5 seats
 jabaki donon dalon ne 50 se zyada siten jeetne kaa mansuba paal rakhaa tha
 This was the reason that before the election results, Mayawati had declared herself as the PM candidate
 loksabhaa chunaav main mili haar se sapa hi nahin balki vipaksh main uthal-puthal machi hui he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi is adamant on his insistence on resigning due to defeat
 vahiin, bihar main argedy haar ke kaarnon kaa pataa laga rahi he
 Apart from this, SP President Akhilesh Yadav is in a mood to make many changes in the organization
 pradesh adhyaksh se lekar kai or netaaon kii chuttee kar jameen se jude netaaon ko tavajjo dene kii disha main man bana rahe hai
 At the same time, BSP supremo Mayawati held a meeting with all the 10 mps who had won and discussed the strategy with them
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav main haar kii vajah ko talashne ke liye kisi tarah kii koi baithak nahin kiya he
 According to the political experts behind this, even though the SP-BSP alliance has damaged the SP, that is why they are churning
 jabaki basapa ko sidhaa phayda hua he
 This is the reason why Mayawati is silent
 dabi jubaan se kai netaa kehete hai ki mayawati ko ghaataa kahaan hua he ki vah samiksha karen vah to sansad main shunya se 10 par pahunch gai hai
 Where did he give up that he should review it
 darasal 2012 ke uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav se lagaataar basapa kaa graph girtaa ja rahaa tha
 The situation was such that the BSP could not even open an account in the 2014 Lok Sabha
 iske baad 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main basapa mahaj 19 siten hi jeet saki thi
 In this way, the 2019 Lok Sabha elections have once again brought new hope for the BSP
 party kii siten badhane ke saath-saath vot share main bhi badhotaree hui he
 While sp's vote has reduced by 4 per cent
 haalanki jaateey voter share ke lihaaj se denkhe to bijepi dalit maton ko apane saath jod paane main safal rahi he
 The BJP has gone out of favor with the non-jatav Dalit vote outright
 iske alaava atipichhadaa vot bhi bijepi ke saath majbootee ke saath judaa rahaa
 This should be a matter of concern for Mayawati, because with these voters, BSP was successful in forming the government in 2007 with an absolute majority in the state
 lekin isi ke baad basapa ke votbank main send lagi he, jo lagaataar jari he
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has told the Lieutenant Governor that the copy of the file sent to the Chief Minister first reached the Leader of Opposition Vijendra Gupta

 In a letter sent to LG, Arvind Kejriwal has also sent a copy of a newspaper report to the Lieutenant Governor, including a statement made by Vijender Gupta to the media

 aatanki hafiz ne america ko pakistan kaa dushman bataate hue kaha ki pakistan ko america se nahin bharat se sambandh banane par baat kerani chahie
 Sadai challenged the US and said that i have a reward of Arbo rupees, but America has not been able to do anything for 5 years! Bhadas took out on the mps of Pakistan and said that "there is no politics in Kashmir, Kashmiris are martyred there, their issue is Pakistan" Neither are you sitting, who are sitting in Parliament, whom you have sent by voting, this is the real hurdle
 kyonki inhen dikhnaa he america kii taraf
 Hafiz said that Islamabad says that we are alone, we say that we will overcome them in some panic soon, we are with you, but whatever happens Kashmiri will not want anything except independence, you will not have any relation with America
 , India should make a connection and the US is hindering it
 "hafiz said ne pakistan ko sabhi pramukh deshon se alag-thalag padane par kaha ki " jis din kashmir azaad ho jaayegaa us din india ko pataa chalegaa kii tanhai kya hoti he, akelaapan kya hota he, sabhi partiyon ko ek hona chahie
 Come together in the name of independence of Kashmir! Come with the people of Pakistan, let the world deteriorate, India cannot do anything, do not miss America, remember Allah! Don't listen to what the US wants, what the enemy wants! "hafiz also said that" America has been lagging behind for a long time, they are saying to reduce the army of Pakistan, reduce the nuclear power, it is the talk of the enemy

 "aatankwaadi hafiz said ne america ko chunauti dete hue kaha ki 5 saal se america ne 1 arab rupaya kaa inaam ghoshit kar rakhaa he, lekin main to bahut aaraam se hum

 chaahe aarthik rup se ho yaa saamaajik rup se ho, berogari ke hon
 In five years, this government has proved to be a complete failure
 ' mukhyamantri ne kaha, “30 saal baad centre main modi ko spasht bahumat mila tha
 He became proud of her
 unhen samajhnaa chahie ki spasht bahumat aayaa par vot unhen 100 main se 31 hi mili

 aapane kya vaade kiye the kitne nibhaa paae aage kya vaade kar rahe hai janata ko bataaya jaaen
 What are the achievements? is aadhaar par chunaav main janata faisla kare
 Referring to the incident of Congress President Rahul Gandhi embracing PM Narendra Modi in Parliament, Gehlot said, "if Modi would have understood that this Rahul Gandhi has come to me as a young man, If you are embracing me then i think that the politics of the country could have taken a turn later that day, Modi could have created an atmosphere of brotherhood, love, harmony in that country
 ” (from input language) jabardast virodh ke bich gujarat ke mukhyamantrinarendra modine shriram college of commers ke chaatro ko sambodhit kiya
 In his address, Narendra Modi said that there will be an atmosphere of despair in the country and also claimed that due to this system we can move forward
 apane sambodhan kii shuruyaat main modi ne kaha ki main mahatma gandhi or sardaar vallabh bhai patel kii dharti se aa rahaa hum
 Two ideologies played an important role in the freedom struggle
 donon hi vichaardhaara kaa gujarat se rishta he
 In a gesture, Narendra Modi targeted the central government and said that today there is an atmosphere of despair in the entire country
 aazaadee ke 60 saal beete chuke hai lekin aaj tak hamen suraaj nahin mila he
 Giving the example of Gujarat, he said that Gujarat is ahead of the country in terms of good governance

 The sectors of agriculture, industry and service paid close attention and took care that these three sectors should have an equal share in the growth rate
 taaki agar koi peeche bhi chhot jaae to vikaas dar par khaasaa asar na pade
 This was possible only through Suraj
 gujarat ke krishi kshetra kii tarif karte hue modi ne kaha ki aaj desh kii har chaay main gujarat kaa doodh he
 The ladyfinger found in Europe is from Gujarat

 Today Gujarat produces a record cotton

 'he said,' Today the whole world sees us as a big market while i believe that the whole world should be a market for us
 iske liye takneekee ke kshetra main aage badhanaa hoga
 We have to create a different identity through new technology
 taaki 'maid in india' kaa paracham puri duniya main lahare
 For this, he talked about learning from a country like South Korea

 The proceedings of the House were about 12 in the Lok Sabha today due to the huge ruckus made by BJP members to raise matters related to corruption related to those sitting in top positions
 25 par dopaher do baje tak ke liye sthagit kar di gai
 BJP raised the issue of corruption as soon as the zero hour started in the issue, bjp's Deputy Leader Sushma Swaraj said that her party members have been giving notice to take up the matter related to people sitting in top positions for the last two days but you have ignored it

 Two narrative books of Indian politics, Bikaner, Price: Rs 600
 bhartiya raajnneeti ke do aakhyaan par kuch bhi likhte hue do tarah ke sankoch man main uthte hai
 The first is that only a big historian can do justice with Priyavand's years of hard work
 hindi main yah sambhav hoga, aisa nahin lagata
 The second hesitate is that despite all his attachment and perseverance to the subject concerned, Priyavand seems to give very contradictory conclusions at some places
 lekin in donon gambhir aakhyaanon main rochakata, romaanch or romance he
 Particularly mind-blowing are some of the documents that are given within the role and the narratives and in the appendix
 pyarelal kii lambii jirah is bhram ko todatii he ki ''gandhi marks yaa unke vichaaron ke prabhaav ko nahin samajhate the
 There is also a fundamental contribution of Priyamvada in the Appendix
 unhone 20 april, 2009 ko em
 N
 shukla se saakshaatkaar karte hue, do gavaahon ke saath unka bayaan darj kiya he
 At the end of December 1949, Shukla, 83, was posted as a magistrate at the Babri Masjid at the same time as the statue of Ramlala was revealed
 ''teen maheene tak main din main masjid parisar main baithta tha or raat main usee kothri main sota tha ('jo masjid parisar ke baahar, usase judi thi)
 
 
 The context of the Babri Masjid and the Ramlala statue did not have any specific mention in the city
 yah puraa prasang tatkaal hi bhula diya gaya tha
 
 
 For 40 years, it was similarly forgotten
 ''priyvand ne itihaas ke adhyeta ke rup main, apni pichhali pustak bharat vibhaajan kii antah katha (1707 se 1947 i
 Till) had also added several forgotten links
 kathakaar ke taur par bhi priyanvad sampradayikta kii vibheeshikaa ko sulajhane-samajhane kii nirantar koshish karte rahe hai
 The book presents an overview of the two streams of politics known as Left and Right, in a period dominated by events from 1920 to 1950
 congress ke bheetar or baahar bhi inke bich takaraav ke kai charam kshanon ko antahkthaon, upakhyanon ke saath yahaan dekha ja saktaa he
 The magnum opus of the first narrative is Gandhi, Nehru and Subhash, in which Nehru and Subhash are seen as wayfarers of the Left
 duusare aakhyaan kaa sheershak swatantraaa, hindu bharat or sardaar patel he
 In fact, this is a division for convenience because there is a good movement in both the contexts, and Gandhi's centrality is in both
 congress ek chhatari-sanghathan jaisi sanstha thi jisamen muslim ligi, hindu mahasabhai, communist or socialist aadi sabhi log aate-jate rahe
 Some sub-sections of both the Left and South streams, both within and outside the Congress, had bizarre similarities despite theoretical battles
 communiston or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke udaahranon main yah dekha ja saktaa he
 Though Priyavand has probably not outlined it
 1942 main or 1947 main, communiston or sangh kii ek-si kriyasheeltaa rahi
 He was against the Quit India movement
 sangh ke barakes samaajwaadiyon kaa raashtra seva dal 1942 ke baad usee dauraan bana tha
 Both were in favor of partition of India
 donon ne vibhinn dhang se ek hi tarah kii saidhantik sthapana di thi
 Within the nation and nationality, the Communists established the doctrine of dualism on the basis of religion
 sangh vagairah ne vijatiyata, vidharm ke naam par do raashtra chaahe
 The independence of 1947 was 'false' to both
 lekin priyanvad ke aakhyaan mahanayakon ke aapasi takaraavon par adhik kendrit hai
 He has exciting discussions about the concrete themes of gandhi-subhash encounter, subhash-nehru competition, patel-nehru schism, gandhi-nehru differences, etc
 subhaashachandr bose swayan ko jawaharlal nehru se adhik samaajawaadee tathaa antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa visheshgy maanate the
 Finally, opposing nehru-gandhi-patel, he started campaigning for the independence of India with the help of hitler-mussolini-tojo
 gandhi ke ghanishthatam anuyaayi sardaar patel shaayad ekmaatr mahanayake hai jinhen priyanvad ne vaiyaktik or saidhantik, donon staron par lagbhag avichlit paaya he
 The description-picture of Patel by Priyamvad refutes the currents that are prevalent about Patel
 priyanvad kaa nishkarsh haih patel ek aasthashil hindu, gandhibhakt, loktantr ke hami, anushaasit or anushasanpriya shaasha-prashaasak the
 He was neither anti-muslim nor Hindutva
 somnath mandir ke punarnirmaan or gandhi hatya ke prasangon main patel kaa jo charitra ubharta he, vah sangh or 'secularist', donon ke prachaarkon dwaara gadhi gai chhavi kaa khandan karata he
 The most interesting thing: In the Priyamvad II narrative, Gandhi-led movement does not consider any movement 'successful'
 par yah sab itihaas-lekhan kii pechidagiyon kaa masalaa he
 If Priyamvand's book can inspire us for esoteric historical debates, then it will be a great contribution to it
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke baad upie ke satta main bane rahane kaa vishwaas jataate hue ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ne aaj kaha ki agar centre main sattarudh gathbandhan bahumat se peeche rah jaati he to vah tisare morche ke saath milakar sarkaar banane ke vichaar ke khilaaf nahin hai
 Pawar said, 'there is no Third Front yet
 is tarah kii sthitiyaan chunaavon ke baad aati hai or phir kuch vyaavhaarik vikalp ubharate hai
 When asked if he sees such an option emerging at the moment, he said, "not now
" main aapako spasht bataa duun ki abhi tak main duusare rajyon main nahin gaya
 i will be able to go after 24 April (when the last phase of voting in Maharashtra ends)
 ' Pawar said, 'this is why i have not done a thorough assessment (of the situation)
 
 Due to my own responsibilities, i did not get an opportunity to talk to the leaders of other parties
 ' baharhaal unhone kaha ki congress se vichaar-vimarsh ke baad hi tisare morche par nirnay kiya jayega
 The 74-year-old NCP leader said, 'definitely
 aap dekhie ki is tarah ke nirnay rashtriya str par kisi vyakti vishesh dwaara nahin liye jate
 We will consult with the Congress
 jarurat padane par samuhik prayaas (tisare morche kii taraf se) hone chahie
 In response to a question whether such efforts would be done before the elections, Pawar said, 'no, no
 chunaavon ke baad or matganana se pehle paryaapt samay hoga
 April 24 to May 16 is enough time
 ' In Pakistan, a petition has been filed to prove martyr Bhagat Singh innocent
 bhagat ke khilaaf 1928 main lahore ke tab ke police adhikari sanders kii hatya ke maamle main exiaar darj he

 On April 11, the Additional District and Sessions Court ordered the police to give a copy of this FIR to Qureshi
 somvaar ko sunwaayee ke dauraan kuraishi ne adaalat se kaha ki unhone police ko adaalat kaa aadesh dikhaaya tha lekin usne unhen exiaar kii prati dene se inkaar kar diya
 The sessions court issued notice to Lahore Police Chief Chaudhary Shafiq in compliance with the court order
 nyaayadhish ne maamle kii sunwaayee do saptaah ke liye sthagit kar di
 Qureshi said that the Legal Affairs Department of Punjab Police has records from 1895 to 1928, but the police refused to give the FIR filed in 1928 in connection with the murder of senior superintendent of police
 unhone kaha ki bhagat singh ke maamle kii sunwaayee karne vaale nyaayaadhikaran ne 450 gavaahon ko sune bagaiyr hi unhen mrityudand sunaaya
 Bhagat's lawyers were not given a chance to cross-examine him

 He said, 'I want to prove him innocent in this murder case
 ' lahore hai court ne is silsile main badi peeth banane ke liye maamle ko mukhya nyaayalay ko bhej diya he
 In March 1931, Singh was hanged at the age of 23 by the British government after hearing about Singh's alleged involvement in the Lahore conspiracy case
 dilli mahila ayog ne purv siem shila dikshit ke khilaaf anti karpshan branch main shikaayat darj karai he
 Apart from Sheila Dixit, charges have also been leveled against Barkha Singh, former chairperson of the Delhi Women's Commission and former minister Kiran Walia
 mahila ayog ne aarope lagaaya he ki shila dikshit ke mukhyamantri or kiran walia ke mantri rahete hue karodon rupye ke ghotaale hue
 The complaint alleges corruption and financial fraud
 haalanki, kai saal pehle chunaav prachaar ke vakt siedervind kejarivalane shila dikshit ke upar bhrashtachar kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Kejriwal can also be questioned, Kejriwal also said that action will be taken against Sheila Dixit
 lekin purv siem ke khilaaf koi karrwai na karne ko lekar bhi beete dinon main kejariwal kii aalochana hui he
 In such a situation, many questions may arise due to accusation of corruption on Badshila Dixit for many years
 udhar, upi chunaav kii sargarmi bad rahi he
 Congress has made Sheila Dixit the CM candidate
 ek media report ke mutabik, shila dikshit khud bhi chunaav ladengi
 In such a situation, they will also have to answer to the new charges leveled against them

 Physically challenged people will also be able to travel in low-floor buses

 Kejriwal has given the gift to physically disabled people
 dilli sarkaar ne pradesh kii sadakon par kareeb 100 nai lo floor bason ko utaara he
 The specialty of these buses is that they are specially made for the disabled
 in bason main lage hydrolic panel shaareerik rup se aksham logon ke liye vardaan sabit honge
 a person sitting in a wheel chair can also travel easily through low floor DTC buses
 kejariwal kaa elaandilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne kaha, 'pradesh ke log jaanate hai kii dilli sarkaar unke liye kya kaam kar rahi he

 The BJP leader said that despite three years of tenure, the government had been doing politics on 351 roads till date and has not done any work

 a local court on Thursday dismissed the charge of attempt to commit suicide against human rights activist Irom Chanu Sharmila

 bahut se chaatro ne hamen likhaa he ki dena bank ne 18 april 2017 ko 300 probeshnari afasaron kii vaikency nikaali thi
 The last date for filling the form was 9 May 2017
 400 rupee isaki fees thi
 Examination date stated 11 June 2017
 lekin imtahaan se 3 din pehle notice aayaa ki pariksha sthagit ho gai
 The examination seems to have fallen asleep as soon as postponed
 june 2017 main honi vaali pariksha sthagit hokar abhi tak uthi nahin he
 Many students have messaged that this feedback be given to the government through prime time public hearing
 bataaiye jisane 400 rupee die, taiyaari main apni zindagi ke kai maheene die use yah jaanane kaa haq he ki nahin pariksha kab hogi
 Reminding the Central Bank of India again when more than 700 youth will get the joining letter while they are sitting home after passing the exam for one year
 agar kisi ko lagata he ki dilli main hone vaali ghatnaon se meraa sho badal jayega to is baar wo galat he
 No big news will happen, i am not going to withdraw from the job series
 isliye acha he ki sansthaaen desh ke in naujavaanon ke saath ye ninsaphi na hone den
 If the government still lays down rules for the next year, then the students will not have any problem
 medical pariksha neet ke chaatr bhi pareshaan hai
 His age limit has been reduced
 do saal, teen saal pehle hi sarkaar elaan kar de ki falaan saal se umr seemaa itani hogi, isse pariksha kii taiyaari main chaatro ke saal barbaad nahin hote hai
 But our students live waste
 wo tab to nahin bol paae jab college main kisi class main teacher nahin tha, librari main kitaab nahin thi
 There are no teachers in arts to engineering colleges, yet our youth do not know how to speak
 chup rahane kii, sahane kii or khud ko barbaad karne kii hamaare yuvaaon kii parampara kaaphi lambii he
 Our effort from the job series is to get the system right
 na sirf chayaraman kii ledar vaali kursi kii jagah lakdi kaa bench lage balki har pariksha thik samay par ho or chori na ho
 Seven-eight boys arrived outside our office
 ye log staff salection kamity siechaesel 2015 kii pariksha paas kar chuke hai
 August 2017 arrived while passing the 2015 exam
 paas kar gaye, merit list main naam aa gaya, vibhaag bhi mila film division magar abhi tak jwining letters nahin mila he
 These boys have also complained a lot to the minister on Twitter, but they have not yet received appointment letter
 hamane prime time main inaki samasya kaa zikr kai baar kiya he
 29 boys have been in the film division but will get joining when they get the letter
 kab letters milegaa ise jaanane ke liye ye dar dar bhatak rahe hai
 One of them came from Bihar, one from Allahabad, one from Rajasthan
 kai dinon se ye dilli main bhatak rahe hai
 It was in this examination that the students got the Industrial Policy and Promotion Department
 magar unhen bhi jwining kaa pataa nahin
 It has joined the general category
 obisi or anusuchit jati ke chaatro kii jwining nahin hui he
 They have been calling here and there for seven months
 esayssi kii maujuuda pariksha chal rahi he usamen bhi kai chaatro ne shikaayat kii he ki unke centre par nakal ho rahi he
 We cannot prove it at our level, but from so many places students are crying and complaining, then how can they say that they are not speaking right
 vaise bhi meraa sho jansunwaayee kaa sho he
 i do not waste time in the gimmick of circling officers and taking no commentary
 ek tarah se sarkaar or avam ko yah feedback he
 If something goes wrong, i will rectify it in the next episode
 bihar karmchaaree chayan ayog ke daftar par chaatr dharna de rahe hai
 Now tell, the second graduate level examination is for 2014, February 2018 is going to end, the result is not known
 jabaki piti kii pariksha ho chuki he
 Men's exam has been done
 daaroga daud ho chuki he
 Even the interview has been done, yet the ranking and result has not come
 ye log pradarshan karne pahunche to vahaan ek notice laga diya gaya ki dharna pradarshan hetu sarkaar dwaara nirdhaarit sthal kaa upyog karen
 Demonstration in front of the commission office is a punishable offense
 iskaa ulanghan karne par aapke viruddh dandatmak karrwai ke saath saath aapkaa abhyarthitv radd kiya ja saktaa he
 Candidate's candidature in Hindi chaar saal main riselt na nikaalane par ayog par kisi prakaar kii dandaneey karrwai kaa praavdhaan nahin he magar vahaan rigelt kii maang ko lekar pradarshan karne par sazaa kii hidaayat di ja rahi he or dhamkee bhi ki aapkaa canditechar yani abhyarthitv radd kiya ja saktaa he
 What a bad joke this is with the youth of Bihar
 hamane naukari series main inaki maang uthaai thi
 but nothing happened
 2014 kii pariksha kaa riselt chaar saal baad yani farvari 2018 tak nahin aayaa, kaayade se kiski kursi jaani chahie aapako bataane kii zarurat nahin he magar yah apane aap main kitna krur he ki yahaan dharna denge to aapkaa candidechar radd kar diya jayega
 Is the youth so useless and bereft of a system? hamane prime time kii naukari series main bihar public sarvice kamishan kii ek pariksha par sawaal uthaaya tha
 Bihar Public Service Commission and Bihar Staff Selection Commission are two separate entities
 bipiessi ke 56 se lekar 59wein batch kii pariksha kaa vigyaapan 1 november 2014 main aayaa tha
 30 July 2016 passed while the prelims and mains examination took place
 july 2016 ke baad july 2017 beetaa
 After July 2017, January 2018 passed
 ab jaakar ek khushkhabari ai he ki is pariksha kaa intervyuu hone ja rahaa he
 Results of 56 to 59 batch of Mains examination of 2014 on the night of 22 February have come out
 736 padon ke liye 1933 chaatro kaa intervyuu ke liye chayan hua he
 Result has come out, i wish the interview would have been dated
 aap sochie chaar chaar saal main ek pariksha puri nahin ho rahi he
 How many young people's wishes must have been ruined
 teen saal taiyaari kiijie, chaar saal pariksha ke riselt kaa intazaar
 Seven years of youth, Hindus went out to see debates on Muslim debates and fake nationalism
 hamaari taraf se in chaatro ko shubhakamaayen
 If the students are happy then we are also happy but we know that this happiness has no meaning now
 iske liye bhi chaatro ne tirangaa yatra nikaali
 How much protest was performed
 tippaniyan In Patna office, some students went to meet our colleague Manish Kumar
 ye wo chaatr hai jo akhil bhartiya str par pariksha karaane vaali esayssi ke multi task staff tear-van kaa imtahaan de chuke hai
 They say that 1 lakh 59 thousand students passed in tier-one
 tear tu ke liye 1 lakh 43 hazaar chaatro ne imtahaan diya
 Its result was to come on 31 March 2018
 lekin isi bich 21 farvari 2018 ko esayssi north rigen par ek soochna aati he ki jo safal ho gaye hai unke dastavezon kaa satyaapan hoga
 Now these students are worried that the result of the second examination has not been out, how these successful students were declared
 ham unki baat yahaan rakh rahe hai
 Multi-tasking staff is a fourth-class job
 disambar 2016 main isaki adhisuchana ai thi, ye farvari 2018 he jo ab bitne ja rahaa he
 MTS students feel that if they are kept in prime time, then the effect will be there
 prime time main dikhaane ke baad railway pariksha kii teen teen sharten badalane ke baad unki ummid bad gai he
 However, many mps are taking credit for this
 shrey unheen ko mili, isi main hamaari kushi he
 Many students have written to us that Dena Bank had vacated 300 probationary officers on 18 April 2017
 9 may 2017 tak farm bharne kii antim tithi thi
 400 was its fee
 imtahaan kii taarikh bataai gai 11 june 2017
 But notice came 3 days before the examination that the examination was postponed
 lagata he sthagit hote hi pariksha so gai he
 The examination to be held in June 2017 has not been postponed yet
 bahut se chaatro ne massej kiya he ki prime time kii jansunwaayee ke zarie sarkaar ko yah feedback diya jaae
 Tell me, who gave 400 rupees, gave many months of his life in preparation, he has the right to know when the exam will take place
 central bank of india ko phir se yaad dilaa de rahaa hum ki 700 se adhik naujavaanon ko jwining letters kab milegaa jabaki ve ek saal se pariksha paas kar ghar baithe hai
 If anyone thinks that my show will change due to the events in Delhi then this time it is wrong
 kitni bhi badi khabar hogi main naukari series se nahin hatane vaala
 Therefore, it is good that the institutions do not let this injustice happen to these young people of the country
 hamaare daphtar ke baahar saat aath ladke aa gaye
 These people have passed the Staff Selection Committee CHSL 2015 exam
 2015 kii pariksha paas karte karte agast 2017 aa gaya
 Passed, got name in merit list, department also got film division but not yet joining letter
 ye ladke mantri ko bhi twitor par khub shikaayat kar chuke hai magar inhen ab tak apointment letters nahin mila he
 We have mentioned their problem many times in prime time
 29 ladakon ko film division main hua he magar letters milegaa tab to jwining karenge
 They are wandering rate by rate to know when letter will be received inamen se ek bihar se aayaa, ek elahabaad se aayaa he, ek rajasthan kaa he
 They have been wandering in Delhi for many days
 isi imtahaan main chaatro ko industrial policy and pramotion vibhaag mila tha
 But they too do not know about joining
 isamen general category kii jwining ho gai he
 OBC and Scheduled Caste students have not joined
 saat maheene se ye idhar udhar phone kar rahe hai
 Many students have complained that copying is being done at their center
 ham apane str par sabit nahin kar sakate magar itani jagahon se chaatr rote padate shikaayat kar rahe hai to kaise kah den ki ve sahi nahin bol rahe hai
 Anyway my show is a show of Jansunavai
 main afasaron ke chakkar lagane or no coment kii pratikriya lene kii nautanki main time barbaad nahin karata
 In a way, this is the feedback to the government and people
 kuch galati hogi to baqayda agle episod main sudhaar karuunga
 Students are protesting at the Bihar Staff Selection Commission office
 ab bataaiye, dwitiya snaatak stareey pariksha 2014 kii he, farvari 2018 khatm hone ja rahaa he, riselt kaa ata pataa nahin he
 While PT has been tested
 mens kii pariksha ho chuki he
 The horse race is over
 intervyuu bhi ho chukaa he phir bhi ranking or rigelt nahin aayaa he
 When these people reached the protest, a notice was put there that they should use the venue fixed by the government for the demonstration
 ayog karyaalay ke samaksh dharna pradarshan dandaneey aparaadh he
 Violation of this can lead to punitive action against you as well as cancellation of your candidature
 canditechar kii hindi hui abhyarthitv
 There is no provision of any punitive action on the Commission for not getting the result in four years, but there is a demand for punishment for demonstrating the demand for the result and there is a threat that your candidature can be canceled
 kitna bura mazaaq he bihar ke naujavaanon ke saath ye
 We raised their demand in the job series
 lekin kuch nahin hua
 The result of the 2014 examination did not come after four years i

 ankhen aamtaur par vyakti ke swabhaav or vyaktitv ke bare main bataati hai
 The color of the eyes, movement of the eyes and tears of the eyes are called a lot
 ankhon ko padhanaa jaan len to saamne vaale ke man ko bhi jaan sakate hai
 In the case of love and relationships, knowing the language of the eyes can give you an answer without saying anything
 aap ye bhi jaan sakate hai ki aapse prem karne vaala, aapse kitna sachcha prem karata he
 The one you love if he speaks directly to you - in such a situation one should understand that the front is very clear-minded - but he will not love easily, nor does he have time for love yet
 - aise logon se prem karne main bahut dhairya se kaam lenaa hoga or niyamit unke sampark main bane rahanaa hoga
 If you steal eyes from someone you love - in such a situation one should understand that the person in front has feelings for you
 - aisi dasha main turant apni bhavanaayen vyakt kar deni chahie , nahin to der ho sakati he
 Just keep in mind one thing that before expressing your love, you must know about the nature of that person
 aap jisase prem karte hon agar aapke saamne aate hi kabhi kabhi uski aankhon main aansu aa jate hon- aisi dasha main samajhnaa chahie ki saamne vaale ke man main prem bhi hai or aapke upar nirbharta bhi he
 In such a situation, do not delay in expressing the feeling of love at all, say it immediately
 - aise vyakti aam taur par sachcha prem bhi karte hai or nibhaate bhi hai 
 If you love someone, if his eyes are closed again and again - in such a situation one should understand that the front is of a very fickle mind
 - agar prem kaa izhaar karnaa he to bahut soch samajhakar hi karen 
 - Such people love again and again and their love is not stable
 ankhon kii bhashaa jab padhanaa bahut mushkil ho- kanya, vrishchik or kumbh raashi ke logon kaa swabhaav aamtaur par rahasyamayi hota he
 - Their eyes are very difficult to read, they cannot be understood with eyes
 - aap jisase prem karte hon agar uski raashi kanya,vrishchik yaa kumbh ho to uskaa angootha jarur dekhiye
 - If the thumb is long then the person will be honest otherwise it would be better to stay away

 If Bihar is left behind, then we would like that those backward areas should also be pushed forward

 It can be made when it is in power
 lekin satta main jo bhi aata hai wo'dharmanirpeksh'hota he
 And a fair government cannot build a temple
 shankaracharya ne kaha ki bijepi ne ab upi main sarkaar banaai he lekin wo saath hi nishpaksh sarkaar he
 BJP is no longer just a political party
 ab wo kaise ek samudaay yaa dharm ke liye jimmedaari le sakate hai
 According to Shankaracharya, the question is whether BJP or any other government can also lay a stone in that area
 desh ke raashtrapati kaa ek kirayedar hai or wo kiraaya detaa he
 Even the President cannot remove that tenant
 is maamle main bhi vahaan sarkaar he or cese court main he
 In such a situation, they cannot do anything
 narsingh raav sarkaarake vakt bhi jameen adhigruhit kii gai thi lekin kuch khaas pragati nahin kii ja saki thi
 Shankaracharya said that the status quo remains intact on the land of Ayodhya
 mudda ye he ki kya wo ram lalaa kii jameen he yaa nahin
 The High Court has certified it
 ab is mudde par baatcheet, chunaav yaa raajnneeti kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 The argument of the Sunni Central Board has been settled, so it is now Ram Lala land
 shankaracharya ke mutabik ram janm bhoomi purnoddhar cameti he
 It has been months since our lawyer has been debating this issue
 nyaayik dakhal ab aavashyak seemaa se baahar ja rahaa he
 The Muslims are not satisfied so they are dragging the matter to court
 shankaracharya ne kaha ki ram mandir ko samarthak or bhakt hi banaaenge naa ki koi raajnneetik dal

 com / azus18zhgz Due to this, there was a lot of problem in the movement of trains going through here
 uttar purv railway, dakshin purv railway or uttar purv frontier railway main kareeb 18 train sevaayen prabhavit hui lekin subah saadhe nau baje sevaayen behaal ho gayi
 (from input language) gujarat main gau sangrakshan kanoon ke baad ab gaayon ko lekar goseva ayog tourism lekar aayaa he, jiskaa makasad gaay ke dharmik mahatv ke saath uski vaigyaniktaa ko badhaava dena he, taaki gaayon ko katlakhaane main jane se roka ja sake
 Where the lions of Gir of Gujarat are known in the country and the world, and to see which millions of tourists come to Gujarat annually, now the Goseva Commission has started cow tourism in Gujarat
 iske jariye desh or duniya ke logon ko gujarat kii gir gaay kii nasl or kakrage gaay kii nasl ko jaanane or samajhane kaa mauka milegaa
 Tourists will take the Goseva Commission to the Gir cow cow shed, where information about 18 different breeds of Gir cow will be available
 naa sirf gir ke gaay kaa doodh ke mahatv balki usase banane vaalegomutra ke arq, gomutra se banane vaali dawaai or gaay ke doodh ke phaaydon ko samajhaayaa jaayegaa
 Not only this, if anyone wants to raise a cow in his house, his information will also be provided here
 gir kii bansari goshaala ke sansthaapak gopal sutariya kaa kahana he ki hamaara makasad gaay kaa asli phayda logon ko samajhaana he, logon ko or gopaalak ko jab tak gaay kaa doodh miltaa he tab tak vah ise sambhalate hai lekin gaay ke puure mahatv ko nahin samajhate hai
 At the same time, the Chairman of Goseva Commission, Dr
 vallabh catheria kaa kahana he ki gaay ke dharmik mahatv ke saath-saath vaigyanik mahatv ko bhi samajhnaa behad jaruri he, jiske liye ham gaay tourism lekar aa rahe hai
 The cow is known as Kamadhenu in Hindu scriptures, but its scientific significance is also considerable
 gaay ke jariye pravaasana ko gaay ke dharmik, vaigyanik or aarthik teenon mahatv ko jodakar logon ko samajhaayaa jayega
 Gopalakas also do not know that they can earn money apart from cow's milk, medicines from cow urine and many by-products like biogas
 go pravaasana ke jariye ab kai videshi log bhi is goshaala ko dekhne or uske phaaydon ko jaanane ke liye aa chuke hai
 Many people are also coming here who want to start a cow table
 gauratlab he ki gujarat sarkaar isse pehle gaay sangrakshan kaa kanoon lekar ai he jisamen gaay ko maarane waalon ke khilaaf aaajeevan karawas kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan he
 Now tourism is being seen as an attempt to prevent the cow from going to the slaughter and save it
