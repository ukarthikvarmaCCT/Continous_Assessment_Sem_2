 Now all political parties should demand and take note of the decision to remove Article 370

 Pooja says this is an adult film that is made keeping in mind the mature audience
 puja kaa kahana he ki vah aise vishay par film bana rahi hai jo ek saadhaaran vyakti ke samaj main aati ho
 She has also made it clear that she never wants children to see this film
 puja ne bataaya, hamane 'e' praaanpatr ke liye arji di thi kyonki main bahut spasht hum ki main 'e' chaahati hum 'you / e' nahin
 i am not making films for children, it is for adults and according to the understanding of adults

 The censor board left these scenes as the director's thoughtfulness

 Pooja Bhatt's film 'jism-2' is releasing on August 3
 is film main bhartiya mul kii canadian kalakaar sani leone, arunoday singh or randeep hooda hai
 Pooja says that she is making a film on a subject that makes sense to an ordinary person
 unhone ye bhi saaf kiya he ki vah kabhi nahin chaahatin ki yah film bachche dekhen
 Pooja told, we had applied for 'A' certificate because i am very clear that i want 'A' and not 'U / A'
 main bacchon ke liye film nahin bana rahi, yah vayaskon ke liye or vayaskon kii samaj ke mutabik he
 Adult viewership is very high and this is enough for my film
 film ke kuch drishy ke hataae jane ke bare main jab unase poocha gaya to unka kahana tha ki isamen thode badlaav kiye gaye hai
 The comments puja ne kaha, sensor board ne mujhase film kii lambaai ko chaar sthaan se chota karne yaa phir ise ek drishy se badalane ke liye kaha, jisamen teen gane the or ek drishy tha
 Among those three songs was 'ye Kasoor' which has already come on the Internet
 sensor board ne in drishyon ko nirdeshak kii vichaarsheelataa maanate hue chhod diya
 Pooja admits that the audience is maturing and that is why she was able to make this film

 kohli) on Dec 11, 2017 at 7:32 am PST yah dekhnaa bahut dukhad tha ki 25 april ko dilli main mukhyamantriyon or hycourt ke mukhya nyaayadhishon ke sanyukt sammelan main desh ke mukhya nyaayadhish (sijei) ne pradhanmantri se ek bhavuk apil kii
 The CJI wept, describing the problem of lack of judges to deal with the mountain of lawsuits
 unki takalif ko samajha ja saktaa he
 Justice T
 es
 Ever since Thakur took over as the CJI in December 2015, he has been preparing his staff and colleagues for the challenges ahead and is expected to collaborate with others related to it, besides the central and state governments, as well as lawyers are doing
 durbhaagya se centre sarkaar ab bhi nyaaypalika kii ore se engeesi kanoon ko khaarij kiye jane or jajon kii niyukti ke liye badnaam collegium system ko barkaraar rakhane kii chot se ubar nahin pai he
 It is not easy to obtain a revised Memorandum of Procedure approved by both the parties and this process can also create disturbances in future
 sijei ne mukademon main deree ke liye do mukhya kaarnon kaa ullekh kiyah vakeelon kaa apni chhuttiyaan chhodane se manaa karnaa, or 2005 main supreme court ke faisle ke anusaar jajon or adaalaton kii sankhya badhaane main rajya sarkaron kii hichkichaahat, jinke tahat nichali nyaaypalika kaary karti he
 Many states feel that the state has no income from the judiciary, so they do not want to spend money on it
 centre sarkaar ke neshnal mishan for justise delivery and legal riforms kii haal kii ek baithak main is baat kaa khulaasa kiya gaya ki bahut se rajyon ne pichley 3-4 varshon main adaalat ke prashasan par hone vaale kharch main teji se kami kii he
 On the other hand some states doubled their investment amount through court fees and pecuniary penalties
 ek rajya ne to ek saal main sirf 4 karod ru
 Had spent but 203 crores through the administration of justice
 jamaa kar liye
 If this information is conveyed to the people involved in the cases, they will start a fight against their states and free the CJI from the difficult task of repeatedly persuading the politicians
 jahaan adaalaton or jajon kii sankhya badhanaa ek vaanchhneeya samaadhaan he, vahiin nyaaypalika main vyavastha or up-vyavastha se mukademon main deree hoti he
 Neither the executive nor the judiciary has paid any attention to this
 mukademe ke virodhatmak model main vilamb antarnihit he, jaisaa ki civil proscisger court, criminal proscisger code or avidence act main banaaya gaya he
 Therefore, many countries have adopted a non-adversarial system for resolution of disputes and have asked cases to be resolved through mutual negotiations without litigation
 haalanki bharat ne kareeb 10 saal pehle apane kanoonon main sanshodhan karke divaani ke mukademon ko madhyasthata ke jariye hal karne ke liye kah diya tha lekin niyamit mukademon ke liye soochibaddh maamalon ko kam karne kii disha main koi prayaas nahin kiya gaya
 The judge and the lawyer are responsible for this
 saaf he ki ham 20veen sadi ke dhaanche or 19veen sadi kii maansikta se 21veen sadi kii vyavastha chalaa rahe hai
 Look at the Family Court, the Juvenile Justice Board and the Village Courts — all of these are special courts designed to expedite disputes through non-adversarial rulings and easy procedures
 sansad ne inamen vakeelon kii maujuudagi ko bhi khatm karne ke niyam banaae hai
 Yet most courts are burdened with unresolved lawsuits, causing many to resort to regular courts
 jab sansaadhan simit hon to praathamikta or prabandhan ke siddhant ke mutabik kaam ko vyavasthit kiya jaataa he
 But the old cases in the judiciary are made even older and trial on new cases is started
 ek tarah ke maamalon main prashikshit jajon kaa tabadalaa aisi adaalaton main kar diya jaataa he, jiske liye ve acchhee tarah prashikshit nahin hote hai
 Administrative responsibilities are also imposed on them, due to which they are unable to devote sufficient time for court work
 adaalaton or mukademon ke budhimattapurna prabandhan ke liye dainik aadhaar par kaarysoochee kii sthiti or kaarywahi ke charan par ek bharosemand or naveenatam jaankaree kii jarurat hoti he
 This work can never be done without modern technology
 haalanki kuch adaalatein us disha main aage bad rahi hai, lekin bahut-si adaalatein aaj bhi takneekee sahyog ke bina hi kaam kar rahi hai
 a major issue responsible for the delay, about which leaders and judges avoid talking, is to improve the "bar"
 kisi pyramid kii tarah sangathit, superstar, vakil moti kamai vaale sabhi mukademon par ekadhikaar kar lete hai or adaalaton ke saath sahyog nahin karnaa chaahate hai, kyonki ek hi samay main kai adaalaton main unki maujuudagi apekshit hoti he
 They demand an adjournment on one pretext or the other and the litigation is delayed
 yahaan tak ki jab ve likhit vakaalat ke jariye apana kaam kar sakate hai, phir bhi ve aisa nahin karte hai-shaayad apane muddai ko khush karne or moti fees ko sahi tehraane ke liye
 Bar councils, which can discipline lawyers, either remain indifferent or they themselves are involved in this loot
 sarkaar ne unhen peshewar banane ke liye vakil kanoon main sudhaar karne kii disha main koi kadam nahin uthaae hai
 The CJI is right: only judges are not responsible for this
 nyaay kii dhahati imaarat ke liye sarkaar or vakil kam jimmedaar nahin hai

 Tamil Nadu Governor Vidyasagar Rao is not in favor of swearing him in as Chief Minister
 rajyapal ne niyamon kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki shashikala ko shapath ke liye nyotaa nahin diya ja saktaa
 Meanwhile, there were reports that the Governor sent a 3-page report on the developments in Tamil Nadu to the Union Home Ministry
 lekin baad main rajyapal ke pradhan sachiv ne is khabar kaa khandan kar diya
 Sasikala had on Thursday submitted a claim to form the government by handing over a letter supporting the mlas
 vahiin panniraselvam ne bhi rajyapal se mulaakaat kar vidhayakon ko apane paksh main hone kii baat kahi thi
 In the midst of uncertainty over Sasikala's swearing-in, the squabbling in Tamil Nadu's ruling AIADMK on Friday escalated as she sacked Presidium president e Madhusudan
 vahiin madhusudan ne unhen annadramuk mahasachiv ke rup main manyata nahin dene ke liye chunaav ayog ko patr likhaa
 Meanwhile, Sasikala said that we believe that the Governor will keep the Constitution and democracy intact
 shashikala ne purv mantri ke e sengottayan ko annadramuk kaa nayaa priscedium adhyaksh niyukti kiya
 Whereas Madhusudan says that i had expelled him before Sasikala drove me out of AIADMK
 sengottayan ko party ke sanghathan sachiv ke pad se mukt kar diya gaya, unhen gat saptaah sanghathan sachiv niyukt kiya gaya tha
 Madhusudhanan on Thursday lent his support to Panneerselvam and said that he wanted to protect the party
 unhone kaha tha ki annadramuk kii raksha karne ke liye har kisi ko panniraselvam se haath mila lenaa chahie
 Madhusudan argues that Sasikala rejoined the AIADMK on March 31, 2012, due to which she does not qualify to become the General Secretary

 is korporate valrd main ham badi chintaa karte hai girte rupye kii, mudrasphiti kii
 But i think what will ruin this country in the long run is our behavior towards women
 ” yah kahana he devayani ghosh kaa, jo intel south asia main cells and marketing kii managing diarector hai
 Intel is the world's leading IT company
 bharat jaise mulk main oonche pad par baithi ek safal bijness vuman hone kaa kya arth he, ghosh ise apane hi shabdon main bayaan karti hai
 The story of their being and becoming is seen by them - how women do not have the voice of half the population in this country and if they are not seen as equal then the country can never progress
 aaj is mulk kii sabase badi samasya yah he ki ham striyon ko insaan hi nahin maanate
 From newspaper to television and Bollywood cinema, this tells us that the ultimate goal of a woman's life is to get married and have children
 yah desh aadhi aabaadi ke dwaara baaki kii aadhi aabaadi ke shoshan par aadhaarit he
 If the people of a country are the biggest source or resource there, are we not reducing 50 percent of our country's resources by making half the population dumb
 shaayad yah baat warren baffate ne kahi thi, jise main aasaan shabdon main yahaan phir se udghat kar rahi hum, “jaise hi koi ladkaa bada hota he, uski bahan kii uplabdhiyon kii chat bhai kii jameen ban jaati he
 This is the truth of this country
 mere bachapan ke dinamein ek bade sanyukt parivaar main paidaa hui or pali-badi
 i had 12 cousins
 africa or europe ke alag-alag hisson main meraa bachapan beetaa
 i studied in seven schools
 kaaphi bade hone ke baad mujhe ehsaas hua ki is tarah ke ghumkkadi vaale jivan kaa mujhe kya phayda hua
 Every time in the new school, in the new place, among the new people, i used to go like an outsider
 vahaan apni jagah banane ke liye pehla kadam mujhe hi uthaanaa hota tha
 These things create a confidence in you
 saath hi ham yah bhi jaan pate hai ki sansar main manushyon ke kitne vividh rang hai, samskruti, khanpan or paramparaon ke vividh rang
 Growing outside India also benefited greatly
 maine apni jindagi kaa aadhe se zyada samay baahar bitaayaa or aaj main jis mukaam par hum, usamen isaki badi bhoomika he
 There are many successful women in India today, but they are still very few today
 bachapan main hi pita ne mujhe yah sikh di thi ki main jo chaahun, vah kar sakati hum
 Now the question for me was just whether i wanted it or not
 striyon ke liye bane kaam kaa maahaulaintel ek shandaar company kyon he? kyonki yahaan gender yaa ling kii koi bhoomika nahin he
 i joined this company 18 years ago after doing MBA
 1996 main intel ke bare main koi nahin jaanata tha
 Everyone was a bit surprised to hear this, but there was a reason behind my joining Intel
 meraa intervyuu debra conred naam kii ek mahila ne liya tha
 She was an amazing woman and now she is our marketing head
 yah iklauta aisa intervyuu tha, jahaan mujhase mere vivaah kii yojanaon ke bare main koi sawaal nahin poocha gaya
 It was also not asked whether i want children or not
 unhone mujhase sirf ek sawaal poocha, “tumhaare sapane kya hai or tum un sapanom kaa kya karne vaali ho?” or tabhi mujhe ehsaas ho gaya ki yahi jagah mere liye bani he
 We at Intel do not have any special plans for women
 ek managing diarector ke bataur yahaan mujhe mahilaon ke adhikaron kii phikr nahin he
 Our effort is to create an environment here where women have equal opportunities for work and success
 mahilaon ko naukari par rakhane ke saath hi hamaara puraa focus un par hota he
 We try to instill confidence in them through all the things that they too accept that they are equal to men
 kyonki khaas taur par hindustan jaise desh main yah hota he ki adhikansh baar mahilaayein khud ko peeche hi rakhti hai kyonki ve isi vishwaas ke saath badi hoti hai ki ve purushon se kamatar hai
 Women are better workers
 Women, whether boss or employee, have to work twice as hard as men and have to prove their abilities more
 darasal striyon ke liye kuch bhi aasaan nahin he
 No matter how much success we achieve, we do not get the same amount of money as men
 yah baat puri duniya par lagu hoti he
 i have a lot of figures to prove it
 duniya kii sari top level kii mahila siio apane samakaksh purush sahakarmi ke mukaable 17 fisadi kam selleri paati hai
 Will it ever change? Probably when more women reach higher positions
 aam taur par log samajhate hai ki stri to najuk or saral hi hogi, lekin yah sach nahin he
 They can be more aggressive and furious than men if needed
 dabaav kii sthiti main striyaan zyada shant or thande dimag se kaam karti hai
 She has a habit of multi-tasking as she plays various roles of mother, wife and daughter
 yah hamaare diene main hi he
 When i look back at my career at Intel, i am very surprised
 jab maine kaam shuru hi kiya tha to mere ek menter ne kaha tha, “tum jawan ho
 You have nothing to lose tum sab kuch aajamaa sakati ho
 "that's why i did everything from sales to marketing
 isse ek bijness ke saare ayaamon ko jaanane or seekhney ke mauka mila
 Today when i go to give lectures in Business School and IIM, i am surprised to see that today the youth feel that the path to success is very straight forward
 lekin yadi aap sabase safal logon ke kariyar kaa graph dekhen to paaenge ki unke kariyar kaa graph hameshaa utaar-chadhaavon se bharaa rahaa he
 For me, this is a big lesson in life
 main apni marji se nissantan hunmain ek sanyukt parivaar se aati hum, jahaan dher saare bachche, bhattije-bhatijiyaan hai
 So i never felt the need to have children of my own
 lekin kai baar isi aadhaar par log mere bare main faisle lene lagate hai
 Some people feel that i am too ambitious, that is why i do not have time to get married and have children
 lekin un logon ko ek baat samaj main nahin aati ki avivaahit hone kaa matlab yah nahin hota ki aapkaa parivaar nahin he
 Perhaps i spend more time with my family than any married person
 ham striyon ke bare main aisi samaj ke saath bade hote hai ki vah har kaam main bilkul parfect hon, jabaki yah baat mumkin hi nahin he
 i do not mind what people say and what they do not say
 haa, main mahatvakankshi hum
 Just days after raising a controversy over the country having more temples than toilets, Union Minister Jairam Ramesh appealed to women to refuse to marry in families where there are no toilets
 kota ke paas khajuri gaanv main sthaneey logon ko sambodhit karte hue kendriya gramin vikaas tathaa jal evam swatchta mantri ramesh ne kaha, ‘us parivaar main shaadi nahin karen, jahaan shauchalay nahin he
 That means no bride, no toilet
 ’ jin logon ko ve sambodhit kar rahe the, unamem zyaadaatar mahilaayein thim
 'take toilet information before marriage', he said, 'you ask astrologer about rahu-ketu etc
 to know the compatibility of constellations before marriage
 aap jab shaadi kaa nirnay kar rahe hon tab aapako ko yah bhi dekhnaa chahie ki dulhe ke ghar main shauchalay he ki nahin
 Later Ramesh launched the third edition of the Nirmal Bharat Yatra in Sangaur, a small town in Kota district
 unhone haryana sarkaar dwaara vahaan swatchta ko badhaava dene ke liye die gaye naare ‘shauchalay nahin to dulhan nahin’ kaa hawala diya
 During the speech, Dia Missalramesh recounted the story of Anita Nair, who left her husband's house to return to the in-laws house in Madhya Pradesh only two days after their wedding
 unhone kaha ki swatchta mahilaon kii maryaada evam suraksha se judaa mudda he or nirmal bharat abhiyaan janandolan he, jiskaa lakshya das saalon main khule main shouch karne kii pratha kaa unmoolan karnaa he
 He criticized the Rajasthan government for not providing adequate sanitation facilities to the people
 vivaadaaspad bayaan par ramesh kaa virodermesh ne kaha ki rajya main 9,177 gram panchayaton main keval 321 hi khule main shouch kii pratha se mukt hui hai
 He asked the administration to prepare a plan to make the state free of open defecation in five years
 isi bich bhagava sanghathanon ke sadasyon ne jagah-jagah ramesh ko mandir evam shauchalay sambandhi bayaan ko lekar kaale jhande dikhaae
 The minister recently said that there are more temples in the country than toilets
 unke is bayaan se dakshinpanthi hindu sanghathanon kii bhrikuti tan gayi thi
 Capt Amol Yadav, a resident of Mumbai, has shown such a feat, that even if he is unable to complete it, he cannot even think about it
 amol ne apane ghar kii chat par hi ek plane bana liya or ab wo use uda bhi sakenge
 Amol, who is awaiting registration of this plane made in 2011, has been given DGCA certificate by Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis
 jet airways main dipti chif payalat rahe amol ne ghar kii chat par 19 saal mehnat karke aircraft tiasi-003 banaaya he
 The aircraft was built in 2011 and was now trying to get the Amol certificate
 bataa den ki amol jet airways main deputy chif payalat ke pad par kaam karte hai
 These players, who raise a family by paying wages, have given training to many young people, working alone, Amol has built a 6-seater aircraft and now they can even fly it officially
 bataa den ki maharashtra sarkaar ab ise mek in india kaa udhaaharan bataa rahi he or siemo maharashtra ne khud twit kar iske bare main jaankaree di he
 Manushi, who has been a CBSE topper, had to be sacrificed for the title
 It is said that in 1895 Shivkar Talpade of Mumbai flew his plane on Chowpatty
 iske 122 saal baad ab mumbai ke hi captain amol yadav khud banaaya hua aircraft uda sakenge
 Amol had to face many difficulties to complete this task and the economic crisis was also a challenge for him
 america ke pramukh dainik akhbaar da waal street jarnal main 9 / 11 aatanki hamale kii 10veen barsi par pakistan dwaara diya gaya vigyaapan pathakon ko raas nahin aayaa he
 Readers have mocked the ad and questioned how a country that claims to be a victim of terrorism where the dreaded terrorist Osama bin Laden had been hiding safely for years
 long waar jarnal ke blog da threat matrix main aadhe pej ke vigyaapan main pathakon ne apni pratikriya di
 It focuses on analysis and reporting on the global war against terrorism
 is blog par darjanon tippaniyon main ek main likhaa gaya, yah kaaphi haasyaaspad he
 They can do a lot for the peace of the world by eliminating the large number of terrorist organizations present
 ek anya pathak ne tippanee kii ki acha hoga agar aap taliban,alqaida ke hamdard iesai par lagaam kasen or phir baari hathiyaaron kaa prayog karne vaale sanghathanon par hamalaa bolen
 The advertisement featured a picture of former Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto and Pakistan has asked, which country can do more work for your peace
 is vigyaapan main bam visphoton ke aankade die gaye hai jisamen pakistan ke netaaon, janata or sainikon ke khilaaf hatya kii yojanaayen shaamil hai
 It said that the country of 18 crores is fighting for the future of seven billion people of the world
 ek anya pathak ne likhaa ki ek dashak tak aaraam se jivan bitaane vaale osama bin laden yaa hakkaani network yaa queta shura ke bare main ab tak koi spashtikaran nahin diya gaya he
 Another comment stated that a country that is the center of global terrorism, against which there is evidence of running a terrorist training camp since the 1980s, which protects the Afghan Taliban who killed NATO troops, is suffering from terrorism
 Is claiming post pole rigelt ke baad ab jabaki yah tay dikhataa he ki congress kaa loksabhaa chunaav main supada saaf hone vaala he, haar kaa thikra kisi ke sir phodne kii taiyaari ho rahi he
 a section of media and anti-rahul Gandhi is trying to blame Rahul Gandhi for this
 unka kahana he ki is buree paraajay ke liye vahi jimmedaar hai
 Party leaders, on the other hand, are willing to take collective responsibility for it
 rahul ke aalochakon kaa yah maananaa he ki unhone na to vah gambhirtha dikhaai or na hi vah ranneeti banaai jo is mahaasangram ke liye jaruri he
 There were many shortcomings in them and they could not take any big step at the right time
 unki style chhapamar yoddhaon kii tarah thi or isliye vah aamane-saamne kii ladaai main maat kha gaye
 On the contrary, his supporters say that he has no fault in this, he is new in politics
 un par dosha madhnaa uchit nahin he or vah iske liye katai jimmedaar nahin he
 Then what is the truth? It was clear as soon as the election was held that Sonia Gandhi did not make Rahul Gandhi the party's PM candidate under a strategy
 unhen is baat kiashanka thi ki agar party haar jaati he to rahul iske liye jimmdar maane jaaenge or iskaa asar unke bhavishya par padegaa
 He was projected as the top Congress leader but avoided the term PM candidate
 lekin ab lagata he ki yah ek galat kadam tha
 He should have been fielded as the PM candidate and then there would have been a solid leadership in the party, which missed a lot in this election
 darasal congress kii ek khaasiyat rahi he ki uske netaa or kaaryakarta hameshaa sheersh netritv kii ore nazren gadaaye rahete hai or vahaan se hi shakti lete hai
 They feel that the Shakti Sources are the Gandhi family
 aise main ve apni takat unhen hi dikhaate rahete hai
 He sees an advantage in this and feels that he will get the reward for this royalty
 isi krupa ko paane ke liye ve apni puri takat lagaate hai
 For the last one and a half decades, the loyalty of all the Congress leaders has been less towards the people and more towards 10 Janpath
 bahut kamalogon ko yaad hoga ki pichley saal rahul gandhi ne upi se chune gaye apane saansadon ke kaha tha ki ve dilli main rahane kii bajaay apane nirvachan kshetron me zyada se zyada vakt bitaayen lekin sabhi ne ansuni kar di
 They will bear the fruits of this time, the party will also suffer
 darasal rahul gandhi ke krupa paatr to sabhi bananaa chaahate the lekin unke bataae raste par koi nahin chalanaa chahta tha
 This situation was not only in UP, it happened in every state
 congress ke bade netaa or zyaadaatar saansad janata ke paas rahane kii bajaay dilli yaa bade shaharon main deraa jamaaye dikhte the
 That is, away from the public
 marketing kii duniya main ek kahawat he, jo dikhataa he wo bikta he
 This thing is now also used in electoral politics
 party ke zyaadaatar saansad janata kii apekshaaon par khare nahin utre to isamen rahul gandhi kaa kya dosha? Celebrities including Bollywood stars Amitabh Bachchan, Lata Mangeshkar, Anil Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra congratulated their fans on Eid and hoped that this year will be full of sweetness, joy and peace of Sevai
 amitabh bachchan ne soshal site par 'id mubarak' likh kar shubhakamana di
 The 'pink' actor in the blog stressed the importance of celebrating various festivals in a country like India
 unhone likhaa, 'tyohaaron or mahatvapurn dharmik samarohon se hamen apanepan kaa ehsaas hota he or prarthana kaa bhav utpann hota he
 
 ekta, sammaan or shanti ke saath ekajutata ke liye prarthana

 Presenting the much awaited trailer of Drishyam, starring Ajay Devgn, Tabu and Shriya Saran
 Releasing 31st July, 2015
 Watch now!posted bydrishyamon Thursday, June 4, 2015 After the sudden retirement of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, where the team's reserve wicketkeeper Riddhiman Saha is scheduled to play in the kidney test, whether the newly appointed Test captain Virat Kohli will make any change in the middle order, the suspense remains intact
 madhyakram main jahaan pehle do test main rohit sharma ko mauka diya gaya vahintisare test menke
 Lokesh Rahul was fielded
 donon hi test main rohit sharma ne kuch khaas nahin kiya to rahul ne bhi niraash hi kiya
 Now the question is whether K
 rahul ko dobaaraa mauka diya janaa chahie yaa rohit sharma ko waapas antim ekadash main liya janaa chahie yaa phir bench par baithesuresh renako utaara janaa chahie
 The flopped Rohit Sharohit Sharma scored 43 and 6 in the Adelaide Test and 32 and 0 in the Brisbane Test
 edilade main team india ne 444 or 315 jabaki bristben main 408 or 224 ran banaae the
 Despite the team scoring big scores, Sharma could not make a big score
 rohit sharma ne 2013 main test maichon main padaarpan ke baad pehle do test main shatak laga kar yah aashaa jarur jagaa di thi ki wo madhyakram main rahul dravid kaa vikalp ban sakate hai lekin uske baad se kheli gai unki pariyon ne kamobesh niraash hi kiya he
 His average in the test is 40
 71 lekin unki kheli gai 16 pariyon main se pichhali 9 paariyaan behad kamjor rahi hai
 In the last 9 innings, Rohit has played 19, 0, 31 (not out), 28, 6, 43, 6, 32, 0 runs
 yani 20
 165 runs at an average of 63
 mjedaar to yah he ki agar rohit kii pehali do pariyon ko hataa diya jaae to baaki 14 pariyon main unhone 21
 Has scored at an average of 69
 milegaa rahul ko ek or mauka?rohit ke isi pradarshan kii vajah se mahendra singh dhoni ne melbern test main ke
 Tried Rahul
 karnataka ke salaami ballebaaj rahul apana pehla test khel rahe the or unke out hone ke tareeke se yah saaf dikh rahaa tha ki wo nervas the
 Rahul never got a chance to play for Team India on the domestic pitch nor was he dropped in odis
 vaise bhi antarrashtriya str par pehla match khelte hue bade-se-bada ballebaaj bhi nervas ho jaataa he or aisa hi kuch rahul ke saath bhi hua
 In the first innings (3 runs), he was caught on the ball just before he was dismissed, but he tried to pull the ball again on the second ball and was caught
 thik isi tarah duusari pari (1 ran) main bhi wo mishael johnson kii gend ko pul karne ke chakkar main slip main kaich de baithe
 Rahul did not play well in terms of performance but due to the first Test, he must be given a second chance
 res main sabase aage rantub yahaan madhyakram ke liye tisare daavedaar hansuresh raina
 Raina's performance in odis has been praiseworthy but he has not been able to do anything special in the Test
 raina 17 test khel chuke hai or isamen unhone 28
 Has scored 768 runs at an average of 44
 kariyar ke pehle hi test main shatak lagane vaale raina ne bhi 29 pariyon main keval ek shatak or 6 ardhashatak lagaae hai
 His test career was towards an end
 lekin pichley saal england main test siries main haar ke baad raina ke pradarshan kii badaulat team ne vanade siries jiti
 This rekindled the trust of the selectors once again
 unhen team ke diarector ravi shastri kaa bhi saath mila jinhone tab unke khel kii tarif kii thi
 Raina was not only selected for the Australian tour but also the BCCI along with Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni made him one of the Grade 'A' cricketers
 itnaa hi nahin kohli kii aakraamak captaini main bhi wo feet hote hai
 Raina has been waiting for his turn for the last three Tests on the Australian tour
 sidney main jeet hasil karne ke liye madhyakram ko pich par tik kar ran bananaa hoga
 Team India's middle order is faltering and in such a situation, in the eyes of Kohli, there will definitely be Suresh Raina as an alternative to Rohit and Rahul
 yani 30 maheene baad ek baar phir se raina ke paas test khilne kaa mauka he

 pune deepies main kaksha saat main padhane vaale amrit ranjan ne chetan bhagat kii nai kitaab 'half garlfriend' kaa rivyuu kiya he
 We have taken this review from Prabhat Ranjan's literary blog 'jankipul'
 yah meri pehali chetan bhagat kii kitaab thi or shaayad yah aakhri bhi hogi
 Chetan Bhagat, i am not doing your evil or anything, but what is the story of this book? Madhav was a boy, Riya was a girl
 madhav ko dosti se badhkar kuch or chahie tha
 But Riya just wanted to be a friend
 mujhe puri kitaab padhate hue laga ki sar chetan bhagat is kahani ko bas khinchate ja rahe hai
 Novel in the spice of the story
 main jab kitaab ke bich main tha, to ek sthaan aayaa jahaan sar chetan bhagat ne apni hi tarif kii he, yah unhone tab kiya jab riya madhav ko angreji seekhney ke gur bataa rahi thi
 He called on Riya that he should read easy books in English such as books by author Chetan Bhagat
 mujhe is baat par bahut hansi ai, khud kii kitaab main apane dhol
 He could replace his name with Ernest Hemingway or Charles Dickens or someone else
 mujhe ek baat is kitaab main bahut buree lagi
 The boy does not know English, speaks in Hindi
 is baat main kya kharabi he? uske dil ko, uski bhashaa ko, sab vah ladki badal detii he
 Chetan Bhagat should have drawn the direction of his boat towards Hindi
 haa main maanata hum ki angreji lekhak hai lekin phir bhi, bhartiya hai
 For those who are fans of Chetan Bhagat, sorry
 ab kitaab kii acchhee baton par aata hoon
 i found Madhav's friends who advise him very 'true'
 mere dost bhi mujhe aisi hi salaah dete hai jisase main hameshaa principal kii ofis ke saamne khadaa rahata hum
 Madhav is a simple boy from Bihar who just came to study
 lekin pehle hi din uski najar ek khubasurat ladki par padi or vah us par fida ho gaya
 One day Madhav brought the girl to his hostel
 usne yah baat apane doston ko bataai or ve usase sawaal poochne lage ki usne us ladki ke saath kya-kya kiya
 This is where the whole story started and ended on the day he wanted to do something with Riya and Riya refused and Madhav angrily said, "give it, then cut it otherwise
" ' us din ke baad unka rishta tut gaya
 Riya gets married early, and despite wanting to marry, she has to marry Rohan of London, who harasses Riya a lot
 udhar akelaa madhav bas padhai karata rah gaya
 The second part of the story is Madhav's return to Bihar
 apni maa ke kaaran vah bihar lautataa he
 The school then calls the Gates Foundation for a toilet facility
 kahani main shauchalay par jor kuch zyaada hi dikhataa he, pataa nahin kyon? or us function main bolne ke liye angreji seekhney patna jaataa he
 Where he encounters Riya
 madhav kii phir vahi koshish ki kisi tarah vah riya ko hasil kar le
 After delhi-bihar, America also comes into the story
 aakhir main mujhe tab acha laga jahaan riya or madhav kii shaadi ho jaati he or unka ek betaa hota he
 Madhav and Riya are teaching him to play basketball
 unka betaa bahut koshish karata he or aakhir main haar maan jaataa he
 But Madhav tells him that to be successful one has to constantly strive
 mujhe ek baat samaj nahin ai
 What can be learned from this book? Keep trying, but what Madhav tried
 is baat ko apane man main doharaa kar dekhie

 ' Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and Samajwadi Party (SP) provincial president Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday termed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as the 'most current party', this time by placing 'wit bets' in the Mainpuri Lok Sabha by-election arena
 Appealed to do
 akhilesh ne mainpuri loksabhaa upachunaav ke liye sapa ummidavaar tej pratap singh yadav ke samarthan main yojit jansabha main bijepi par janata ko gumraah karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha, ‘achche din laane kii baaten karne vaale log ab lav jehad kaa jaap kar rahe hai
 People who say love jihad are current people

 He said, 'I used to say earlier that there is no more current party than BJP
 ham mainpuri kii janata se apil karenge ki is baar un par buddhi daanv lagaakar chit kar do
 The SP leader, pointing to BJP MP Yogi Adityanath raising the issue of so-called 'love jihad', said, 'baba people are talking about love jihad
 yahi baba ek baar maahaul kharaab karne ke liye jhaansi ja rahe the lekin hamane unhen rokkar band kar diya tha
 We want to argue with them and BJP about which road, which bridge or which development work you want to do in the state
 unhen samaajwaadiyon kaa acha kaam bhi bura lag rahaa he
 Accusing the Narendra Modi government of the Center of vandalism, Akhilesh said that during the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had made big promises
 berogari or mahangaai khatm karne kii baat kahi thi lekin aisa nahin hua
 No one knows in which direction the central government is going for the welfare of farmers and for power crisis

 ' Minority Rohingya Muslims are being largely targeted in the ongoing army operation and majority violence in Myanmar's Rakhine province
 haalat ye he ki lakhon rohingya apni jaan bachaane ke liye bharat, bangladesh, malaysia jaise deshon kii ore sharan ke liye bhaag rahe hai
 The role and attitude of Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi are being questioned in this major humanitarian crisis
 su chi is maamle main rohingya kii bajaay desh kii sena or bahusankhyak buddha samudaay ke saath khadi hai
 People are surprised how Sui Chi, who has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, sees a large population of his own country being victims of violence
 wo bhi tab jabaki su chi ne apni jindagi kaa ek bada vakt bharat main bitaayaa he or ve mahatma gandhi ke shanti or ahimsa ke aadarshon kii badi prashansak rahi hai
 What was Sui's relationship with India? Sui Chi first came to India in 1960 when her mother Dow Khin Chi was sent as Burma's ambassador to India
 us samay ve 15 saal kii thim
 Su Chi studied at the Convent of Jesus and Mary School in Delhi and after completing her schooling, she went to Lady Shri Ram College in Delhi
 su chi ne isi college se raajnneeti shaastra main grajuation kiya
 The special thing is that she used to live at 24 Akbar Road in Delhi at that time where the Congress headquarters is today
 nehru ne tab khin chi ke sammaan main 24 akbar road kaa naam burma house rakh diya tha
 Suu Kyi then lived in the same room that Rahul Gandhi now got as Congress vice-president
 kitaab '24 akbar road' ke lekhak varisht patrkaar rashid kidawai likhte hai ki su chi tab sanjay gandhi or rajeev gandhi ke saath khelaa karti thim
 What is Aung San Suu Kyi's stand on the Rohingya? Aung San Suu Kyi said on Tuesday that she was not afraid of an international investigation into the Rohingya crisis
 unhone maanavadhikaron kaa ulanghan karne waalon ko insaaf ke kathghare main laane kaa pran bhi kiya
 At the same time Suu Kyi refused to blame the military on the violence that forced more than four million Muslim refugees to flee Myanmar
 iske saath hi su chi ne kuch sharnaarthiyon ko dobaaraa basaane kaa sankalp liya
 However, he did not offer any solution to stop the violence in Rakhine province
 kya bandhe hue hai su chi ke haath?su chi ko jaanane waalon kaa kahana he ki 72 saal kii netaa main 50 saal se desh par kabiz rahi sena par ankush lagane kaa damakham nahin he
 At the same time, human rights organization Human Rights Watch believes that Suu Kyi is not speaking much, because she is in danger of opposition from the military and Burmese people
 myanmar main badi aabaadi buddha samudaay kii he, jo rohingya musalamaanon ko bilkul pasand nahin karte
 Therefore, not only in view of any apprehension of internal crisis and political gains in the country, Su Chi is standing with the army which has been attacking the Rohingya Muslims despite all the criticism
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki khajaane kii tang haalat or aam chunaav se pehle lokapriyata hasil karne kii raajnneetik majaburiyon ke bich vitt mantri pi
 It is a big challenge for Chidambaram to make the general budget accountable
 girti gharelu vruddhi dar, oonchi mudrasphiti, rajkoshiya ghate tathaa chaalu khate ke ghate ke saath saath vaishvik arthvyavastha ke sankaton ke bich pesh kiye ja rahe 2013-14 ke bajet main niveshkon kaa vishwaas behaal karne ke saath hi rajkoshiya ghate ko simit rakhane kii badi chunauti he, taaki vaishvik credit reating agenciyon ko ungali uthaane kaa avasar na mili
 Chidambaram has said that the next budget will be a 'responsible budget'
 baavjood sattarudh gathbandhan ke liye 2014 ke aam chunaav se pehle is aakhri purna bajet main aam aadmi ko khush rakhane kii darkaar bhi aswabhaavik nahin he
 According to experts, increasing the revenue is the biggest challenge for the Finance Minister
 das varsh main sabase kam vruddhi kar rahi maujuuda arthvyavastha main nae kar lagaana yaa kar kaa boj badhaana vruddhi or nivesh kii dharna donon hi drushti se jokhim bharaa hoga
 There may also be an option to cut budgets of schemes as a measure of fiscal balance
 mahatma gandhi rashtriya gramin rojgaar guarantee yojana, skulon main madhyahn bhojan, rashtriya gramin swasthya mishan or rashtriya gramin aajeevika mishan jaise kaarykram samprag ke pramukh kaarykram hai jin par bajet main bada aavanton karnaa hota he
 The subsidy burden is also increasing due to increase in the price of crude oil
 agle saal farvari main sansad main keval lekhanudaan hi paarit hoga kyonki may tak aam chunaav hone hai
 The Finance Minister has been consistently saying that the fiscal deficit should be reduced to 4 in the next financial year
 8 pratishat par laayaa jaayegaa
 5 in the current financial year
 3 pratishat ke daayre main rakhane ke bharsak prayaas he
 5 of GDP in the budget estimate presented in February last
 1 pratishat tak simit rakhane kaa lakshya tha
 According to Ved Jain, chairman of the Direct Taxes Committee of the Board of Commerce and Industry Assocham, the government is moving towards the implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) in the country
 jiesti main utpaada evam sevashulk samahit ho jaayenge
 And they will have the same rate
 yah ek dar 14 pratishat se upar rahane kaa anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa he
 In this context, there may be an initiative in the budget to bring the current excise and service tax rates in line with the proposed GST
 sarkaar ne varsh 2008-09 main vaishvik vittiya sankat ke parinamswarup petroleum ko chhod anya utpaadon par utpaada shulk charanbaddh dhang se kam karke 14 pratishat se ghataakar 8 pratishat par laa diya tha
 In the budget for the year 2010-11, it was increased from eight to 10 percent
 rajkoshiya sudhaar kii zarurat ko dekhte huye pichley bajet main ise 10 se badhaakar 12 pratishat kar diya gaya
 In view of the thin state of the treasury, it can be increased again to 14 percent in the upcoming budget
 kuch vishleshkon kaa to yahaan tak kahana he ki company kar kii dar main bhi vruddhi ho sakati he jabaki duusari taraf sanyatra evam mashinari par moolyahras dar main riyaayat dete huye ise maujuuda 15 pratishat se badhaakar 25 pratishat kiya ja saktaa he
 The export situation is also not good due to the crisis in the global market
 pichley saal april ke baad se lagaataar niryaat main giravat kaa rukh bana hua he
 Hardly 0 in January
 82 pratishat niryaat vruddhi darj kii ja saki he
 Earlier, there was a steady decline in exports from May to December
 vaanijya evam udyog mantri anand sharma ko aakhir kahana padaa ki chaalu vitt varsh ke dauraan niryaat kaarobaar 300 arab dollars ke aasapaas rah saktaa he
 In the last financial year, exports were $ 306 billion
 is saal ke liy 360 arab dollars kaa niryaat lakshya rakhaa gaya tha
 The Federation of Indian Exporters Organization (FIEO), the apex organization of exporters, has demanded that the government should create an 'export Development Fund' for aggressive marketing of Indian products in the international market with the benefit of tax deduction under the Income Tax Act
 
 fio ne kaha he ki vinirmaan kshetra main nivesh ko badhaava dene ke vaaste niryaat se judi ikaiyon ke vistaar or aadhunikeekaran main maanak ke anuroop bhaarit katautee kaa laabh milanaa chaiye
 In order to keep the export cost down, the emphasis has been on refunding the value added tax (VAT), sales tax on petroleum products, purchase tax, business tax, octroi, electricity duty etc
 on the exported goods
 fio ke anusaar isse visheshtor par upabhokta vastuon ke niryaatkon ko 2 se 3 pratishat kaa phayda hoga

 dilli sarkaar main kaamkaaj ke taur tareeke se pareshaani kii tasdik dilli ke sabase bade adhikari yani mukhya sachiv ke ke sharma ne somvaar ko kar di
 The OSD, who oversees all the work of KK Sharma, was transferred by the service department on Friday
 vah bhi bina mukhya sachiv ko jaankaree die
 Chief Secretary Officer on Special Duty Rambir Singh has been transferred to the Subramaniam Commission set up to investigate the disturbances at DDCA
 mukhya sachiv ko bataae bina oesady kaa tabadalaarambir singh ko taakid kii gai ki unhen tatkaal prabhaav se kaaryamukt kiya jaataa he taaki wo 1 farvari kii subah subramanyam ayog main report kar saken
 The order of 29 January of the service department was issued with the signature of the Deputy Secretary
 up sachiv vibhaag ke sabase junior adhikari hai
 The minister of the department is himself Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia while the Principal Secretary of the department is Rajendra Kumar, close to the Chief Minister
 kahani yaheen khatm nahin hui
 The Chief Secretary, Chief Secretary KK Sharma, did not like this, raging on his own government
 unhone somvaar ko daftar khulte hi sakht shabdon main ek nayaa aadesh jari kiya
 In the order, the Chief Secretary not only objected to the transfer of his OSD, but also revoked the service department's Friday decision with his signature order
 apane aadesh main sharma ne likhaa he ki seva vibhaag ne jo tabadale kaa aadesh jari kiya vah mukhya sachiv karyaalay ke ek ahm karmchaaree ke tabadale kaa he jiske bare main mukhyaschiv se koi bhi manjuuri nahin lee gai
 Sharma has again used sharp words to say that his office contains many sensitive and confidential documents, which only the Chief Secretary of the Chief Secretary can see
 saath hi unhone kaha ki chunki mukhya sachiv karypalika kaa mukhiya bhi he to use kai alag-alag kism ke kaam bhi karne hote hai
 Therefore, transfer of their trusted OSD is mandatory
 lihaaja vah is aadesh ko radd karte hai
 After two days, the Chief Secretary himself overturned the order of the Services Department
 ab sawaal khadaa ho gaya ki aakhirkaaradilli sarkarmen faisle koun le rahaa he
 When even the office of the Chief Secretary of Delhi is not untouched by discrimination, then the condition of the rest of the offices can be understood
 paanch hajaar feet kii oonchai par bana he aasthaa kaa aisa param dham jahaan aaj bhi milte hai pavanputra hanuman ke nishaan
 Yes, it is very difficult to reach such a place where anyone who gets the privilege of seeing Pawanaputra here has no desire left
 ye jagah isliye bhi mahatvapurn he kyonki yaheen par balak hanuman ke muhan main samaa gaye the jag ko roshan karne vaale surya bhagwaan
 This abode of Sankatmochan is built at an altitude of five thousand feet from the ground
 aasmaan se baaten karata he ye sthaan, anjaniputra ke bal, unki mahanata, unki bhakthi kii kahani sunaata he ye dham
 Those who come to see Maa Anjani and Hanuman on Anjanariparvat see here the miracle that happened millions of years ago
 lekin uski nishaniyaan aaj bhi bhakton ko hairaan karne ke liye maujuud hai
 Yes, there is a lake resembling the shape of a foot, which is said to be made of the pressure of the hair of Hanuman's feet
 kahani us samay kii he jab anjaniputra behad chote the
 No matter how much the mother gave to eat, her hunger was not relaxed
 ek baar unhone yaheen se suryadev ko akaash main chamakate hue dekha
 Seeing the red sun, he felt that it is a fruit, then, pressing one foot on the ground, he jumped vigorously and pressed it into the mouth
 suryadev hanuman ke muhan main gaye or jag main chaa gaya andhera
 It is said that Indra attacked his chin to get Suraj out of Hanuman's mouth, so that Suryadev was liberated but his chin was broken
 isi vajah se unka naam pad gaya hanuman
 This lake built on Anjaneri Parvat reminds us of that incident even today
 anjani or sankatmochan ke darshan ko aane vaale bhakt is sarovar main dubkee lagaaye bina nahin lautate
 It is believed that touching its water is equivalent to touching the feet of Bajrangbali
 anjaneriparvat par maa anjani or hanuman ji kii roj subah shaam aarti hoti he jisamen bhaag lene ke liye dur-dur se bhakt aate hain
 The way to reach here is difficult, but the mere exhaustion of Anjaniputra removes the fatigue of the devotees
 bhakt bhagwaan ko prasann karne ke liye 11 dinon tak ek saath baith kar paath karte hai
 The worship of Bajrangbali and the singing of glory is as important as the recitation of the name of the adorable Lord Rama
 aisa karne se bhagwaan jaldi prasann ho jate hai or de dete hai manachaaha var
 Stories of Hanuman's valor have been scattered on Anjanariparvat, while Sankatmochan is also associated with Gumla district of Jharkhand
 kehete hai gumla pavanputra kaa nanihaal tha yaheen anjani ne apni jindagi kaa ek bada hissaa guzaara
 The signs of Mata Anjani and Hanuman present here still overwhelm the devotees
 jharkhand main biabaan jangalon ke bich basaa he wo sthaan jahaan apni mata kii god main virajte hai anjaniputra hanuman
 This land tells the story of Mata Anjani's tenacity
 isi jameen par kathor tap kar mata anjani ne paaya hanuman jaisaa putr
 About 140 km from Ranchi in Jharkhand
 kii dur gumla jile main ghaney jangalon ke bich apni mata kii god main darshan dete hai sankatmochan
 But it is very difficult and courageous to reach Hanuman's darshan amidst the wilderness forests, because this area is very inaccessible and away from the means of traffic
 lekin jo bhi bhakt mata anjani sang hanuman ke darshan karne main safal hota he unhen yahaan milti he aseem shanti or urja
 It is said that this place is Hanuman's maternal grandfather
 unki maa anjani yaheen paidaa huin or pali badhin or baad main unhone shaap se mukti paane ke liye yahaan tapasya bhi kii
 According to the people here, there are about 360 lake and 360 Shivling in this area
 apane tap ke dauraan mata anjani ghaney jangalon ke bich rahakar roj nae-nae sarovar main snaan kar alag-alag shivlinga kii upasna karti thim
 According to the Puranas, Mother Anjani was cursed that she would become a virgin mother
 isi vajah se unhone aise biawan jangal ko chunaa jahaan un par kisi par-purush kii chaaya bhi naa pade
 Pleased with his severe austerity, Bholenath gave the boon to be born as Hanuman, the eleventh Rudra avatar from his womb
 iske alaava is sthaan se judi he ek or kahani wo bhi hanuman kii mata anjani ke purv janm kii
 It is said that Mata Anjani was Apsara Punjikasthala in the court of Devraj Indra in her previous birth
 wo atyant sundar or swabhaav se chanchal thi
 Once in his fickleness he committed indecency with a fiery sage
 gusse main aakar rishi ne punjiksthala ko shraap de diya ki ja tu vanar kii tarah swabhaav vaali vaanari ban ja
 Hearing the curse of the sage, Punjikasthala started apologizing to the sage
 tab rishi ne kaha ki tumhaara vah rup bhi param tejasvi hoga
 You will be born a son whose fame and fame will make your name immortal for ages
 yahi wo jagah thi jahaan anjani ko hanuman jaise vir putr kaa aashirwad mila
 It is believed that by coming here and having darshan of Hanuman ji with mother Anjani, all the wishes of the devotees are fulfilled
 khaas taur par santan kii kaamana lekar aane waalon ko jarur miltaa he mata anjani or pavanputra kaa aashirwad
 You saw the baby Hanuman sitting on the lap of Mother Anjani
 ab chaliye jaipur, jahaan bal mudra main dukh harte hai bajrangbali; is mandir main sankatmochan bacchon ke ksht vishesh rup se harte hai
 It is believed that children never touch any sorrow after coming here
 brandan mackulam ke tufaani ardhshtak ke baad antim overon main gendbaajon ke umdaa pradarshan kii badaulat newjiland ne duusare or antim twanti-20 antarrashtriya match main bharat ko ek ran se haraakar do maichon kii shrunkhlaa 1-0 se jeet lee
 Yuvraj Singh, who is recovering from cancer after making a comeback in international cricket after almost nine months, won all the hearts with his performance, but could not win India
 unhone antim over main pavilion lautne se pehle 26 gend main do chhakkon or ek chauke kii madad se 34 ran banaae
 He earlier gave 14 runs in two overs bowling and caught a catch

 Kohli shared a 60-run partnership with Suresh Raina (27) and a 34-run partnership with Yuvraj

 hamane wo kahaniyaan bhi suni hai jo jaateey samikarnon ke myne or ahmiyat bataati hai
 We have also been told many times that money and muscle power are important in politics, not honesty and transparency
 kaha bhi jaataa he ki raajnneeti achche logon ke liye nahin he
 The electoral history of our country is littered with examples of how good candidates stand in the election to lose
 is mulk ke raajnneetik itihaas main aisi misaalon ne achche logon ko siyasat main aane se hameshaa roka

 'dilari' ko salaamamadhya pradesh main shivaraj singh ne hetric laga di he
 By the way, all the pre-poll surveys were also calling him invincible
 lekin iske baavjood vah do vidhansabha siton se chunaav lade
 Do not lose on your own seat, so as a precaution, he decided to contest from Vidisha along with Budhni
 vahiin agar kejariwal kii baat karen to naa sirf unki party chunavi akhaade main pehali baar utari, balki unhone bhi pehali baar chunaav ladaa
 He announced to contest the election against veteran leader Sheila Dixit of the party which had given power to the Congress for three consecutive times in Delhi
 arvind ke paas ek surakshit seat se chunaav ladane kaa vikalp tha, lekin vah shila dikshit ke raajnneetik itihaas se nahin dare
 What if the party leader loses his seat? The question of 'agar-magar' did not come in Kejriwal's mind and the public respected his courage and courage

 Saluting Congress 'ideals' and BJP speak of honesty in public life
 lekin jab chunaav aate hai to wo donon ummidavaaron ke chayan ke maamle main eemaandaaree kii bajaay 'jeetne kii yogyata' ko tavajjo detii hai
 But Kejriwal proved him wrong
 party banaate vakt unhone janata se vaada kiya ki vah kisi bhi daagi vyakti ko tikat nahin denge
 After being accused by other parties, he removed a party candidate just 4 days before the election
 jaahir he aam aadmi party ko apane usulon or aadarshon kii parvaah he
 3
 'eemaandaaree' ko salaamasab jaanate the ki kejariwal kii party ke paas ek hi cheez he- eemaandaaree
 This is his wealth and this is his weapon to beat his rival parties, so other parties have tried to stain his image and his party's image
 kai baar khud kejariwal or party ke anya netaaon ko nishaanaa banaate hue unke khilaaf jaanch karai gai
 Even Anna Hazare questioned the integrity of the party
 lekin kejariwal date rahe or apni eemaandaaree or paardarshita kaa saboot dete rahe

 The public saw all this and supported AAP because honesty means a lot to him

 Salute to 'youth' Most political parties talk of youth participation in power
 lekin sach to yah he ki unke ye jumale sirf hothon tak hi simit hote hai
 When it comes to giving tickets in elections, the party high command only picks the veteran and veteran leader
 unke mutabik raajnneeti kootneeti kaa khel he, jo ki tajurbekaar netaa hi samaj sakate hai
 Even if he gives tickets to the youth, the power and party command remains with the same old leaders
 lekin kejariwal is sthiti ke ulat yuva voter or yuva ummidavaaron ko tavajjo di
 The result is in front of everyone
 dilli vidhansabha kaa sabase yuva sadsy unheen kii party kaa he, jisaki umr 25 saal he
 The public stamped this 'youth' ideal of Kejriwal
 5
 Saluting 'public issues', both Congress and BJP seem to be talking about public issues
 lekin chunaav prachaar ke dauraan congress ne bhrashtachar ke mudde ko darkinar kar diya
 BJP redeemed the issue according to its convenience and finances
 isi mudde ne bijepi ko apana siem ummidavaar harshavardhan ko banane ke liye majaboor kar diya, jabaki kejariwal ne is samasya ko ek bada chunavi mudda banaaya
 He made issues related to costly electricity-water and general public issues
 saaf he ki ye vidhansabha chunaav modi banaam rahul gandhi nahin, balki janata banaam vyavastha kii jang the

 Citizenship Amendment Bill passed in Rajya Sabha after Lok Sabha; Shiv Sena boycotted during voting in Rajya Sabha
 After Lok Sabha, the Citizenship Amendment Bill was also passed in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday
 rajyasabha main lambii charchaa ke baad voting se yah bill paas hua
 During the voting, 125 votes were cast in favor of the bill and only 99 votes against it
 jiske baad rajyasabha main yah aitihaasik bill paas ho gaya
 The Citizenship Bill has now been approved by both houses of Parliament
 iske baad vidheyak par raashtrapati ke hastakshar ke baad yah kanoon ban jayega
 Shiv Sena chose the middle path: In Maharashtra, Shiv Sena, which recently formed the government with the support of Congress and NCP, chose the middle path
 shivasena ne rajyasabha kii voting prakriya se dur rahane kaa faisla liya or sadan se walkout kar liya
 Let us also tell you here that the Shiv Sena supported the Citizenship Amidment Bill in the Lok Sabha
 aise main shivasena kaa yah kadam sabake liye chaunkaane vaala tha
 Shiv Sena's ideological compulsion Shiv Sena may have formed a government in Maharashtra in collaboration with two secular parties a few days ago, but its ideology has always been Hinduist
 yahi vajah he ki rajyasabha main is bill kaa virodh karnaa shivasena ke liye mushkil ho rahaa tha
 Because of this, the Shiv Sena changed the decision
 Congress sources told Aaj Tak that the party's top leadership was upset with the Shiv Sena voting in favor of the bill in the Lok Sabha
 isse judaa spasht sandesh maharashtra main haal hi bane gathbandhan tak pahunchaa diya gaya tha
 For this reason, Shiv Sena changed its stand on the bill within 24 hours
 sanjay raut ne di safishivsena netaa or saansad sanjay raut ne party ke is kadam par safai pesh kii he
 Sanjay Raut has said that my party and i have decided that the questions arising on this bill have not been properly answered
 isliye yah sahi nahin hoga ki bill kaa samarthan karen yaa virodh
 Sanjay Raut further said that we do not say that refugees should not be given citizenship, they should get citizenship
 lekin ham kehete hai agar vot bank kii raajnneeti ke liye sajeesh hui he, jaisaa ki aarope lagaae bhi gaye hai to unhen agle 25 saalon tak voting kaa adhikaar na diya jaae
 The central government has approved the abolition of the policy of failing children up to 8th class
 aise main ye tips un students ke liye he, jo ab tak padhai ko lekar laaparvaahee barat rahe the
 If you do not want to fail in class, then do such preparation
 shuru se rakhen dhyanstudents ke behatar bhavishya ke liye sarkaar ajukeshan system main kai badlaav kar rahi he
 In such a situation, you tighten your back about studying
 taaki badlaav kaa asar aapaki padhai par naa pade
 You should have knowledge of every subject, you should know about every subject taught in class
 taaki kisi bhi vishay main badlaav hone ke baad bhi asar aapaki padhai or marks par naa pade
 When the daily routine becomes the shout of the boss, then do not keep yourself cool, the purpose of this decision of the government is that students should not take their studies lightly
 bhale pehle sarkaar kii niti ke anusaar aap 8veen tak paas ho jate the
 Students are not able to bear the burden of studying in 9th standard
 bejaan offis desk main yun bharen jaan
 
 
 Strengthen Yourself If you want to earn your name in every field, then focus on studies from the beginning
 sarkaar apane hisaab se students kii padhai or behatar banane ke liye aae din nae-nae badlaav karti rahengi
 But you should prepare yourself in such a way that even after studying, do not feel any pressure
 congress ne 80 varshiya shila dikshit par phir bharosa jataayaa he
 The party has appointed him chairman of the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee
 yah duusari dfa he jab shila dikshit ko sankat ke samay dilli kii kaman saunpi gai he
 Sheila Dixit may have lost the election to the Aam Aadmi Party, but the party could not stand again after she left
 dilli main karaae gaye vikaas kaaryon ne unhen ek alag pahchaan di thi, party ne duusari qatari ke netaaon ko khadaa karne kii koshish kii, lekin alaakaman ko mahasoos hua ki dilli main agar waapas ladaai main aana he to shila se behatar koi vikalp nahin ho saktaa
 Given the kind of expectation from them, the challenges will not be reduced in front of them
 sabase badi chunauti dilli main ladkadaati congress ko phir khadaa karnaa he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has captured the section of the Congress that once used to be the vote bank of the Congress
 yah chunauti isliye bhi badi he kyonki aam taur par mana jaataa he ki congress kaa vot nimna madhya varg or madhya varg he
 But the Arvind Kejriwal government has tried to make this vote bank of Congress through its initiatives like improving the structure of water-power, Mohalla clinics, school education
 bejaan sanghathan main kaise foonki jaae jaan?congress ne shila dikshit ko aise samay jimmedaari saunpi he, jab dilli main uske ek bhi vidhayak nahin hai
 The workers are almost shattered
 abhi dilli congress ke duusari qatari ke netaa kahin najar nahin aa rahe hai
 Lack of government at the Center and Delhi has led to a drop in enthusiasm among party workers
 sanghathanaatmak str par party ko chust-durust kiye jane kii jarurat he
 The party is busy in taking its steps in the state
 shaayad congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne isiilie shila dikshit ko jimmedaari saunpi he taaki party ke liye phir se dilli kii siyaasi jameen taiyaar kii ja sake
 The Congress has been strengthening its vote base since the assembly elections in 2013, and this will be the challenge before Sheila Dixit
 kitna mumkin he aam aadmi party se gathjodrashtriya str par jis tarah kii raajnneetik tasviir philhal bani hui he, usamen congress samet vipaksh main khadey sabhi kshetreey dal gathbandhan main chunaav ladane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Coalitions have also been announced in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
 inhen sargharmiyon ke bich dilli main yah kayaas lagaae gaye ki kya loksabhaa chunaav main congress apane pratidwandvi nai naveli aam aadmi party se gathbandhan karegi? siyaasi galiyare main isaki sugabugahat sunne ko mili kii congress is par vichaar kar sakati he
 But the question is, will the Congress ally with the Aam Aadmi Party? From the Aam Aadmi Party, which has been born from the womb of the movement against Congress against corruption
 bhrashtachar virdohi anna andolan se na sirf aam aadmi party paidaa hui balki vidhansabha chunaavon main usne congress ko arsh se farsh par laa khadaa kiya or party kaa koi iklauta ummidavaar vidhayak nahin chunaa ja sakaa
 Ajay Maken, who took command of Delhi from the political injury suffered by the Aam Aadmi Party, may be feeling well
 isliye vah aam aadmi party se gathbandhan ke khilaaf the
 Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh has also refused to flag friendship with Arvind Kejriwal in his state
 shila dikshit bhi iske khilaaf hi najar aat rahi hai
 In a conversation with Aaj Tak, she says, 'congress is capable in itself
 hamen kisi se gathbandhan karne kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin he
 The record of the Aam Aadmi Party has not inspired us
 hamane kabhi bhi aam aadmi party kaa samarthan nahin kiya
 He contested against us
 ’magar kaha yah bhi jaataa he ki raajnneeti main kuch bhi mumkin he kyonki yahaan koi sthaayee dushman yaa sthaayee jaisi koi cheez nahin hoti he
 If it becomes clear that the Congress has to ally with the Aam Aadmi Party for the Lok Sabha elections in Delhi, then the question will be that in the assembly elections? Will the two parties enter the electoral fray together? Or will the paths of both be different? How effective will Dikshitila Dixit take the command of Delhi Congress earlier in 1998? us samay raajnneetik halaat aise ban gaye the ki party ko lagaataar vibhinn chunaavon main shikast kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa tha
 This can be gauged from the fact that the Congress had lost in 1991, 1996 and 1998 Lok Sabha, 1993 Legislative Assembly and 1997 Municipal Corporation elections as well
 shila dikshit kii puraani profile ko dekhte hue congress haikaman ne unhen dilli kaa netritv saunpane kaa faisla kiya he
 She was the Chief Minister for 15 consecutive years
 isi dauraan dilli kaa puraa infrastracchar badalane kaa shrey unhen diya jaataa he
 Thanks to his administrative experience, he has reassured the high command on himself
 kyonki unke kaamkaaj ko lekar koi vivaad dekhne ko nahin miltaa he
 He is considered a better manager
 apane puraane tajurbon ko lekar confidence se bhari najar aati hai
 On this question of 'aaj Tak' she also says that, 'the high command feels that i have experience of Delhi and that is why he chose me to head the New Delhi Congress
 ’bijepi ko satta se bedakhal karne ke liye vibhinn rajyon main vipakshi dalon kaa ekajute hone kaa kram shuru ho gaya he
 The Congress is strongly in favor of the Grand Alliance
 vah bihar main mahagathbandhan khadaa kar chuki he
 However, Sheila Dixit is not disclosing her political strategy
 dilli main congress ke paas loksabhaa or vidhansabha main ek bhi seat nahin he
 In this situation, on the strategy of the next election, she says, 'the alliance is under discussion in Delhi and when the time comes, it will be known
 ’ The Congress party in Jammu and Kashmir wants Omar Abdullah to be removed from the post of Chief Minister
 ghati main congress ke netaa neshnal conference (nekan) kii ore se apni andekhi kiye jane se kuch zyada hi khafa hai, jabaki unhone janvari, 2009 main gathbandhan kii aguai umr abdulla ko saunpe jane ke sonia gandhi ke faisle kaa bharpoor samarthan kiya tha
 But now they want the Chief Minister's post to be given to a leader of his own party by 5 January 2012, by which time three years of Omar Abdullah rule will be completed
 srinagar main is badhate asantosh kii kai vajahen hai
 For example, the Chief Minister remains silent to the extent of apathy; Relying on the advice of his advisors and bureaucrats instead of the wisdom of political giants; His inability to deal with difficult situations, which led to violence for two consecutive summers; And his unmistakable ability to invite controversy — tweeting at the Afzal Guru's hanging or inadvertently identifying women who were raped
 to kya teesri peedi ke abdulla, jinase logon ko kaaphi ummiden thim, itani jaldi apane rajnatik kareer main arthhin ho gaye hai?srinagar congress ke jila adhyaksh abdul gani khan kehete hai, ''mukhyamantri kaa pad congress ke paas hona chahie
 It was a 50-50 partnership between the Congress and the National Conference
 ''pipuls democratic party (pidipi) kii adhyaksh mahabuuba mufti kahati hai, ''umr kaa kisi bhi cheez par kabhi niyantran nahin rahata
 "his reference was to the ruckus caused by the death in police custody of National Conference activist Haji Syed Muhammad Yusuf on September 30
 isse ek din pehle hi bhrashtachar ke aarope main unhen gupakar road par mukhyamantri ke sarkari nivas par bulaayaa gaya tha
 The Yusuf case is the latest in a long list of controversies and scandals that have put the 41-year-old chief minister in trouble
 srinagar main is samay jo sabase bada sawaal uth rahaa he, vah yah he ki hijbul mujahidin kaa purv samarthak yusuf aakhir mukhyamantri kaa itnaa kareebi kaise ho gaya?is 'najdiki' ko sabit karne ke liye mahabuuba apane mobile par kuch tasviren dikhaati hai, jinamein yusuf haal main congress ke mahasachiv rahul gandhi ke daure ke samay manch par umr abdulla ke bagal main khadaa he
 Other politicians claim that Yusuf was also close to the Chief Minister's father Farooq Abdullah
 mahabuuba ne kaha, ''ham pehle se kehete aa rahe hai ki umr abdulla kii neshnal conference sarkaar bahut bhrasht he
 The money game is going on for higher positions
 ''ve saboot ke taur par umr abdulla kii us sweekaarokti ko saamne rakhti hai ki yusuf ne vidhaan parishad main nekan kaaryakartaaon ke liye siton ke badale main ek badi rakam manjuur kii thi
 It remains to be seen whether anyone in the ruling coalition, even the Chief Minister, has denied these allegations of corruption
 baharhaal, yusuf kii maut kii nyaayik jaanch kaa dayera umr ke nivas or uske baad police hiraasat main hui ghatnaon tak hi simit rahegaa
 Khan says, "what kind of investigation?" They know who were the people to benefit
 neshnal conference ke netaa paisa le rahe hai or ab logon kii hatyaein bhi ho rahi hai
 "khan is deeply hurt by his party's support base in the valley
" haalanki ve yah nahin maanate ki umr bhrasht hai
 But Khan says that the Chief Minister has created a group of corrupt people around him
 ve dilli main apni hi party ke netritv lekar naaraaz hai
 He says, "rahul Gandhi came here for a walk like a prince
 '' ve is baat se kaaphi dukhi hai ki rahul ne srinagar main party ke daftar kaa daura nahin kiya
 Congress leaders now openly or privately want a bigger stake in the government in Kashmir
 yusuf vaale maamle se pehle hi bahut-se yuva kaaryakartaaon ne nijee taur par rahul ko radgay main jari bhrashtachar or bhai-bhatijawad kii jaankaree di thi
 According to him, the leaders and workers of the Congress are being deliberately ignored, due to which senior vice president Muzaffar Hussain Parri had to resign from the party
 haalanki baad main pradesh adhyaksh safuddin soz ne unhen manaakar party main waapas bula liya
 Khan alleges that the Congress's Panchas and Sarpanchs are also being treated in a step-wise manner
 unhone kaha, ''nekan unke apane hi gaanvon main unka sammaan nahin karti, to phir ve mukhyamantri kaa samarthan kyon karen
 We (congress people) can lock people in our offices and ask people to sit in their homes
 ''umr ke aasapaas jamaa nekan ke logon kaa kahana he ki sonia gandhi ne puure chah saal ke liye nekan kaa mukhyamantri banaae jane kaa vaada kiya tha
 According to a senior NC leader, "even the portfolios of ministers were initially decided on this basis
 '' ghati main rajnatik dabaav ke chalate gathbandhan ko lekar dilli ke iraadaa badalane kii sambhaavna se chintit nekan ke netaaon kaa maananaa he ki lagaataar do garmiyon main uthal-puthal ke baad apekshaakrit shantipurna rahe is saal yuva netaa umr behatar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 He says that his fast-paced leader is working hard to connect people with him
 party ke ek varisht padaadhikari ne kaha, ''ve 39 nirvachan kshetron kaa daura kar chuke hai, unhone srinagar se baahar 53 jansabhaayen kii hai or hameshaa janata darbar lagaate hai, jisamen ve har buudhvaar kii subah kareeb 800 logon se milte hai
 "they hope that Delhi will see this change clearly, which will be 10 in the Valley this year
" 73 lakh sailaaniyon se bhi jaahir hota he
 30,000 foreigners are also included in these tourists
 umr or unke salaahkaaron ke paas agle teen saal ke liye satta ke shikhar par bane rahane kii ek or bhi vajah maujuud haih congress netaaon kaa ek asardaar tabaka, jinhen sarkaar main jagah di gai he
 Public Health Minister Taj Mohiuddin, a similar Congress leader who has a place in the government, says that it would be "impractical and impossible" for the Congress to press for the chief minister's post
 unhen puraa yakeen he ki ''ensi kabhi bhi congress ke netritv vaale gathbandhan kaa hissaa nahin bananaa chaahegi
 "khan disagrees
" ve kehete hai, ''ye log aaleeshaan bangalon main rahete hai or mukhyamantri se moti tankhwaahen lete hai
 How can they oppose Omar? ”local officials also admit that NC would never want to sit in the opposition as it would be difficult for him to re-establish the party after three years in power
 ek varisht prashasnic adhikari kehete hai, ''har kashmiri jaanata he ki dilli hi kashmir main apana hukum chalaati he; isliye nekan vahi karegi jo dilli use satta main bane rahane ke liye kahegi
 He says Umar will do everything possible to deal with the situation
 ho saktaa he ki ve aakhir main apane se zyada lokapriy netaa or apane abba faruk abdulla ke liye rasta saaf kar den
 Giving his own knowledge of the chief minister's troubles in Srinagar, an elderly man said, "he should not have taken the oath of office during Muharram
" matam ke dauraan khushi kaa koi kaam nahin karnaa chahie
 "it means that the father-son duo have a challenge to deal with this adverse condition and prove their worth
" ''umr abdulla kii neshnal conference sarkaar puri tarah bhrasht he
 In Jammu and Kashmir, hefty amounts are being traded for high positions

 (bhashaa kii khabar) The Department of Telecommunications had earlier extended the deadline for verification of mobile numbers from Aadhaar till the Supreme Court's decision on petitions challenging the constitutional validity of Aadhaar
 (bhashaa kii khabar) Concern is often raised about the existence of Sanskrit
 sanskrit ko lekar skulon main chaatro kaa rujhaan naa hone kii vajah se ye sawaal kiye jate hai ki is bhashaa kaa bhavishya main koi naam lene vaala bhi rahegaa yaa nahin
 Amidst all these apprehensions, there is good news for Sanskrit lovers from the southern state of Karnataka
 karnataka ke shimoga jile main mattur naam kaa aisa gaanv he jahaan kaa har bashinda sanskrit main hi baat karata he
 What child, what old man and young man all speak fluent Sanskrit
 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav kii gahamagahami ke bich hi ‘ajtak’ aapako is anokhe gaanv se rou-ba-rou karaane ja rahaa he
 There are around 300 families living in Matur village
 is gaanv main pravesh karte hi aapako ek alag sa anubhav hoga
 Seeing the costumes of the villagers, you will feel that the people of Chanakya have reached India
 sirf pahanaave ko hi nahin is gaanv kelogon ne duniya kisbase pracheenatam sabhyataa or bhashaa ko bhi sahej kar rakhaa hua he
 Sreenidhi, who hails from Muttur village, about 320 km from Bangalore, says that Sanskrit is the spoken language of this village
 yahaan gaanv mensanskrit padhaaneke liye har tarah kii vyavastha he, paathshaala main vishesh kakshaen hoti hai or bina kisi jatigat bhedbhaav ke koi bhi baccha shiksha le saktaa he
 The children here do not have any problem in reading and understanding Sanskrit
 yahaan baccha-baccha farrate se sanskrit bolta he
 When this reporter asked the children what they like, they gave quick answers in pure Sanskrit
 bacchon ko vedon kaa bhi acha gyaan he
 During this time, children were seen speaking in Sanskrit in the same manner as the reporter - 'keep watching till today for the fastest news
 ’haalanki is gaanv kii paaramparik bhashaa sanketi he, lekin har ghar mensanskrit kaa vidwanapako jarur milegaa
 As many as Sanskrit speakers speak Sanskrit, as much as they speak English from Farrate
 yani aadhunik duniya se bhi gaanv kii kadamtal puri he
 When Arun Awadhani, a senior elder of the village, was questioned in English, the kind of answers he gave to Tapak was shocking
 yaheen nahin jo sanskrit main bolaa uskaa haathon haath hindi or angreji main anuwaad bhi kar diya
 Politically, the people of Matur village also looked very alert
 aruna avadhaanee ne sanskrit main kaha, ‘ye nahin kah saktaa, karnataka main is baar kise satta milane ja rahi he, haa pradhanmantri narendra modi jab chunaav prachaar ke liye utrenge tab tasviir saaf hogi
 'when he met Nand Kumar from the same village, he wore pants and a shirt
 nand kumaar bolte hai to unki jubaan par sanskrit ke sivaa kuch nahin aata
 In broken Hindi, Nand Kumar said that his next generation is also adopting Sanskrit with great passion
 gaanv kii chaoupal par kuch bujurg haathon main tulsi kii maala liye aapas main charchaa karte dikhe
 He told that since the year 1980, this village has brought Sanskrit in its heart
 in bujurgon kaa kahana he ki sanskrit kabhi kashmir se kanyakumari or dwarka se nepal tak boli jaati thi, aaj gaanv waalon ke liye ye bhashaa sabase anmol dharohar he
 How the wires of this village are connected to other parts of the world is also an example of Reva, the daughter of a family of the village itself
 landan main rahane vaaleen reva kahati hai jab videsh main bhi sanskrit ko bahut sammaan or mahatv ke saath dekha jaataa he to unhen apane gaanv par bahut garv hota he
 a scholar was found in the village in the same dress as Chanakya
 naam- chintamani
 They say that this dress is part of their tradition
 chintamani kehete hai ki bahut acha lagata he jab baahar se log gaanv kaa naam sunakar aate hai or sanskrit main dilchaspee dikhaate hai
 When the reporter was talking to Chintamani, a woman named Rukmani appeared from the front
 chintamani or rukmani ne aapas main sanskrit main hi baat kii
 Rukmani also expressed pride in the Sanskrit language
 hindi ko lekar rukmani ne kaha- ‘hindi bhashaa nazanami’ yani unhen hindi bhashaa kaa gyaan nahin he
 The reporter's questions were then translated into Sanskrit by Chintamani
 rukmani ne sanskrit main hi unka jawaab diya
 Then Chintamani explained what Rukmani said
 chalate chalate chintamani ne ye bhi dikhaa diya ki agar sanskrit main reporting kii jaae to kaise hogi

 film nirdeshak sanjyalila bhansaali kii pitayee ke baad se chal rahaa rajputon kii kerani sena kaa andolan ab chittod durg tak pahunch gaya he
 The theme of Rani Padmini has been steadily catching up due to which the Karni Sena has started a movement to remove the stories related to the world famous historical Chittorgarh fort and the glass in the Padmini palace
 'padmavati' par shuru hua ghamaasan, shivasena ne kaha- itihaas se chhedchhad bardaasht nahinkerani sena ne chittod ke durg main ghuskar pradarshan kiya or vahaan padmini mahal main lage us kaanch ke tukade ko hataane ke liye kaha jise gaids vahaan aanevaale touriston ko dikhaate hai ki isi kaanch main allaudin khilji ne rani padmavati ko dekha he
 At the same time, Tourist Guides has also warned to bear the consequences if these wrong things are told
 ise lekar kerani sena ne puraatatv vibhaag ko ek saptaah kaa samay dete hue chetavanee de daali he
 The founder of the Karni Sena does not regret the incident; the Johar Smriti Sansthan of Chittor has started rewriting the history of the fort and Padmavati
 inkaa kahana he ki padmavati ke rani hone ke subut to kile main hai lekin allaudin khilji ne is durg ko kabhi jeeta tha iske subut kahin nahi he
 The incident of Alauddin Khilji and Padmavati is written by the Shufi poet Mallik Muhammad Jayasi in the period of Sher Shah Suri in 1540
 jabaki padmavati uske 237 saal pehle rani hui thi
 In fact, in the film being directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Rani Padmavati's Alauddin Khilji's dream of telling Rani Padmini, had to face opposition in other districts of the state including Jaipur

 Karni Sena leader Govind Singh Khangoret said that we will not let the tourism department and archeology department tell the false history
 kaanch kaa avishkaar rani padmini ke kaarykaal ke kaaphi baad main hua he
 In such a situation, the things that Khilji saw in the glass of Padmavati are false

 karnataka main philhal sabase bade siyaasi pad par kabiz echdi kumaraswami rajya ke 18wein mukhyamantri hai
 He has been the state president of JDS in the state and is the son of party chief HD Deve Gowda
 isse pehle bhi kumaraswami 2006 main karnataka ke mukhyamantri rah chuke hai
 Despite becoming the Chief Minister of Karnataka twice, Kumaraswamy could not achieve the same importance as his father in Delhi
 vah do baar loksabhaa to pahunche lekin centre kii raajnneeti main unki bhoomika ek saansad se zyada kii kabhi nahin rahi
 Kumaraswamy was born on 16 December 1959 at Hardanahalli in Hassan district, Karnataka
 unhen raajnneeti viraasat main mili kyonki unke pita echdi devgauda pehle hi raajnneeti main pravesh kar chuke hai, jinhone baad main desh ke pradhanmantri pad tak kaa safar tay kiya
 Kumaraswamy did his early schooling at a government school in Hassan and then moved to Bangalore for higher education
 yahaan se unhone B
 Sc degree earned
 saal 1986 main kumaraswami ne anitha se shaadi kii, donon ke ek betaa he jinka naam nikhil gauda he
 Nikhil is an actor in Telugu and Kannada films
 saal 2010 main kannada film abhinetri radhika ne yah daawa kiya ki kumaraswami ne 2006 main hi unase shaadi kar lee thi, saath hi un donon ke ek beti bhi he
 Political journey The political journey of Kumaraswamy started from 1996 when he won the election from Kanakapura Lok Sabha seat
 lekin iske do saal baad hue upachunaav main unhen isi seat se karaari haar kaa saamana bhi karnaa padaa
 Kumaraswamy then contested the assembly election from Sathnoor in 1999, but lost again
 saal 2004 main vah ramnagar se jitkar vidhansabha pahunche
 In this election no party got a majority to form the government and in the state a coalition government of Congress and JDS was formed
 iske baad 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main kumaraswami ne jeet darj kii
 The Chief Minister of such a state, Kumaraswamy, in 2006 pulled out his party from the coalition government of Congress and JDS in 2004
 nateeja hua ki congress ke dharam singh kii aguwai vaali sarkaar gir gai
 The Governor then called Kumaraswamy to form the government and thus on 4 February 2006 Kumaraswamy was elected the Chief Minister of Karnataka for the first time with the support of BJP
 haalanki unka kaarykaal 7 maheene kaa hi rahaa or gathbandhan kii sarkaar ke chalate unhone oktober 2007 main pad se istipha de diya
 Kumaraswamy's JDS was the third party in the state for the second time in the last assembly elections held in Karnataka last year
 lekin tab soobe kii sabase badi party bijepi ke paas akele sarkaar banane ke liye paryaapt aankade nahin the
 After this, the opposition Congress formed the government in alliance with the JDS and Kumaraswamy got the chance to become the Chief Minister of Karnataka once again
 haalanki pichley kuch dinon se lagaataar congress or jedies ke netaaon ke bich talkh bayaanbaji tej ho gai he
 Kumaraswamy has a deep connection with controversies, whether it be personal life disputes or misuse of office while he is Chief Minister
 kumaraswami kii duusari shaadi ko lekar bhi vivaad hua, jisamen unke khilaaf hindu marij act kaa ulanghan karne ke maamle main PIL daayar kii gai thi
 According to media reports, she married Kannada actress Radhika, although the Karnataka High Court dismissed the petition for lack of evidence
 iske alaava kumaraswami or unki patni anitha par kol khadaanon ko lekar bhi kai gambhir aarope lag chuke hai
 The Kumaraswamy couple has also been accused of illegally occupying land during 2006 by misusing power

 arunachal pradesh ke sela main hua yuddhayadab nishkarshon kaa akalan kar rahi senabhartiya thalsena ne kam sainikon ke saath ladi jane vaali nai yuddh ranneeti kii kshamtaaon ke akalan ke liye pehla yuddhayas kiya
 The biggest lesson that has emerged from that exercise is that there is no compromise with the aspects related to signals to ensure good communication
 sena se jude top sutron ne yah jaankaree di
 The Indian Army conducted the exercise at a height of 14,000 feet at Sela in Arunachal Pradesh, about 90 km from the 'line of Actual Control' about a month ago
 isi yuddhayas ke nishkarshon kaa ab akalan kiya ja rahaa he
 This is being done to understand the performance of 'integrated Battle Groups' (ibgs) in high altitude inaccessible battle areas
 sena ke ek ucch adhikari ne bataaya, “pehle aisa vichaar he ki signlles component ko ghataane se halki lekin chust-durust or gatisheel sena banaae rakhane main madad milegi
 But during the maneuvers we saw that this could not be done because in some areas the communication links were cut off
 ”‘da indian army corp of signlles’ ke paas sena ke sanchaar network ko sanbhaalane kii jimmedaari he
 This intelligence plays an important role in information gathering and operations such as electronic warfare
 ‘integrated battle grups’ (ibgs) bhartiya sena ke nae formations hai jinhen yuddh kshamtaaon ko badhaane ke liye apanaaya ja rahaa he
 For this, the emphasis is on quick and more deadly attacks on the enemy
 ibgs main aisi brigade hongi jo durgam kshetron or khataron ke aadhaar par kshamtaaon se las hongi
 With the arrival of ibgs, Infantry, Artillery, Air Defense will be brought under one command in the 'corp Level Formations' of the Army
 sena ke vibhinn ang report taiyaar karne main lage hai
 Which will be compiled
 phir antim taur par jo akalan hoga wo eastern kaman kii ore sena mukhyalay ko bheja jayega
 The Kolkata-based Eastern Command is responsible for operations on the China Frontier along the Line of Actual Control

 The truth of relationships on the test of research
 What in 'kamasutra'? Perhaps you have heard the same question in the movie 'harry Met Selly'

 Among these films, films like 'my Best Friend Wedding' and 'hum Tum' are also well liked

 Relationship counselor Kamal Khurana says that when a woman and a man become emotionally attached to each other, either of them is attracted towards each other
 yaheen se rishte main ulajhane shuru hoti hai, khaskar jab ek mitra shaadishuda ho
 As the openness in the society is increasing, are we also able to understand each other's relationship emotionally? Lifestyle expert Rachna Singh says that often the definition of best friend leaves your spouse behind and it is from here that problems arise
 rachana ke anusaar ek ore dosti main jahaan pyaar, vishwaas or saath hota he, vahiin shaadishuda jindagi main pyaar, vishwaas or saath ke alaava sex bhi hota he
