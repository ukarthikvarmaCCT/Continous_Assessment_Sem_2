 The company has a debt of about 10,000 crores
 2015 disambar main iskaa ghaataa 2000 karod kaa ho gaya he
 The company wanted to increase the cost of construction of the bridge
 kiskaa daawa sahi-sahi or kiskaa galat yah kahana mushkil he lekin pul girane se 25 logon ko apni jaan jarur ganvaani padi he

 tippaniyan Now come to today's question
 kya fliover itane jaruri hai ki ham kahin bhi kaise bhi bana dete hai
 If you look at flyovers across the country, then you will get many such flyovers, if made of style
 chote shaharon main kuch fliowaron ko dekhakar to ji ghabara hi jaataa he
 The problem of traffic jams is increasing everywhere
 netaa bhi logon ko aashwast karne ke liye pliover kii aadharshila rakh dete hai
 In Delhi, in the last ten-fifteen years, close to a hundred flyovers would have been built
 is shahar ke anubhav se bataa saktaa hum ki kuch fliover to kaamyaab lagate hai lekin zyaadaatar fliover ke banane ke baad bhi jam kii samasya samaapt nahin hoti he
 Talk of building 50 flyovers in Mumbai has been going on for two decades
 bengalooru main 40 fliover ban gaye hai
 There are also plenty of flyovers in Chennai
 aae din akhabaaron main fliover ke shilanyas or udghaatan kii tasviren aap dekhte rahete hai lekin kya kabhi dekha he ki inase trephic kii samasya dur hoti bhi he yaa nahin
 Apart from traffic, it is also said that the flyover also affects the surrounding social system
 paryaavaran par bhi asar hota hi hoga
 Do you also think that the traffic jam problem has ended since the flyover came
 mere khud ke anubhav main to donon hi baaten hai
 If traffic has not been resolved from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi, then the Ghazipur flyover has solved a lot
 kisi sookhe naale kii tarah donon taraf ke makaanon se sate yah fliover bahata chalaa aa rahaa he, badrang, benur or beong
 Looking at design, it seems that engineering and design studies have stopped in India
 na samaj, na kalpana dikhti he
 Before constructing this bridge, it was not even thought about how it would affect the lives of the surrounding houses and people
 yah saare makaan saath se sattar saal puraane hai
 The thought of which great scientist to pass a two kilometer long bridge between them should be present
 pul yahaan ke makaanon ko chhukar guzar rahaa he
 So close that you can scale
 ek foot kaa bhi antar nahin he
 Even if there is an engineering failure, we will not make such a design
 kam se paanch se chah foot kaa antar to rakhega
 The houses here are passing so close that even the windows cannot open
 ab aap bataaie yah pul ban jaataa to yahaan ke makaanon par kya asar padataa
 How would the vibration of the bridge affect the houses
 duniya ke kis ejineering kalege main aisi dizine padhai jaati he ki ghar kii khidki se sataakar pul yaa haive bana do
 Can this happen only in India? Can this happen only in Kolkata? If the bridge did not fall, then the houses adjacent to it would fall on this bridge
 logon ne mukadmaa bhi kiya hua he
 Traders have also opposed this
 vampanth se lekar trinmul sarkaar ko is pul kii vicitra or khatarnaak dizine kii to jimmedaari leni hi chahie
 This flyover was not being built in any corner or side of Kolkata but is a very important place
 aasapaas aspataal hai, koching santhaan hai, fal or phool kii mandi he
 It was to end in Pushta where there is a very big house
 vahaan ke logon kaa bhi imtahaan he ki ve kaise sangathit hokar apni ladaai ladate hai
 Actually people fight but the systems beat them
 mukhyamantri mamata banerjee guuruuvaar ko dopaher se lekar raat ke ek baje tak ghatnasthal par baithkar bachaav kaary kii nigaraanee karti raheen
 All officers were present
 ghatana ke baad kii najar se dekhen to saraahneey he ki mamata banerjee sadak par baithkar sara kaam dekh rahi hai lekin yahi sakriyata pul girane se pehle ve isse judi shikayaton ke prati dikhaatin to kya yah haadasa tal nahin jaataa
 Was Mamata Banerjee or the bridge-making department fully confident of its design
 unhone to vaada kiya tha ki pul jaldi banegaa lekin kya unhone dhyaan diya tha ki pul ko lekar unke hi saansad or sthaneey log kya shikaayat kar rahe the? Now come to company inkaa naam he IVRCL
 The company is headquartered in Hyderabad
 iske paas 3000 ejeeniyar hai
 It has such a large army of engineers
 company ne apni site par likhaa he ki yah JNNURM kaa yah sabase mushkil project he
 The structure is entirely steel
 25 saal puraani yah company kai tarah ke kaarobaar se judi he
 It has many businesses including water and environment, irrigation, transportation, building and industrial structures, power supply, mining maintenance
 company neshnal stock exange or bisai main listed bhi he
 The company has contracts in Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra to Karnataka
 pul kyon gira isaki jaanch shuru ho gai he or kolkata kii police hyderabad pahunch gai he
 Even after being associated with such a big business, after the accident, the statement of this company comes that it is 'act of God'
 pul ke girane se khud god kaa mandir dhwast ho gaya he
 Not God but the verandah of Goddess Kali's temple has also fallen due to the fall of this nominal bridge
 company ke is bayaan kii insaanon kii duniya main kaaphi aalochana hui he
 God did not come clean on his act, but the company that wrapped God in this act gave a clarification in Hyderabad that there may have been a blast
 shishe toote hai
 The company was given the first deadline of 18 months to build this bridge
 67 maheene biit gaye
 While the IVRCL company blames the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority for not delaying the delay for the delay, the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority alleges that the company is working too slowly
 lekin abhi aarope kya he
 The allegation is not why the bridge took so long to be built
 aarope yah he ki pul kaa saath meter kaa hissaa kaise gir gaya

 If you look at flyovers across the country, then you will get many such flyovers, if made of style

 If traffic has not been resolved from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi, then the Ghazipur flyover has solved a lot
 yah fliover kolkata ke kisi kone yaa kinare main nahin ban rahaa tha balki behad mahatvapurn jagah he
 There are hospitals around, coaching institutes, fruit and flower markets
 pushta main ise khatm hona tha jahaan kaaphi bada makaan he
 People there also have to test how they organize and fight their battles
 darasal log ladate hai magar vyavasthaaen unhen haraa hi detii hai
 Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee sat on the scene from noon to one o'clock on Thursday, monitoring the rescue work
 tamaam afasar maujuud the
 It is commendable to look at the aftermath of the incident that Mamata Banerjee is sitting on the road watching all the work but if she showed the same activity to the complaints related to it before the bridge collapsed, then this incident would not have been averted
 kya mamata banerjee yaa pul banane vaala vibhaag isaki dizine ko lekar puri tarah aashwast tha
 He had promised that the bridge would be built soon, but did he pay attention to what his own mps and local people were complaining about the bridge? ab aate hai company ji par
 Their name is IVRCL
 company ji kaa mukhyalay he hyderabad main
 It has 3000 engineers
 itani badi fouj he ejiniyaron kii iske paas
 The company has written on its site that this is the most difficult project of JNNURM
 puri tarah se steel kaa dhaancha he
 The 25-year-old company is involved in a variety of businesses
 jal or paryaavaran, sinchai, transportesan, building or industrial strecchar, bijli kii supplai, mining mentanence sahit kai kaarobaar hai iske
 The company is also listed on the National Stock Exchange and BSE
 andhrapradesh, madhyapradesh, maharashtra se lekar karnataka tak main is company ke paas theke hai
 An investigation into why the bridge fell has started and Kolkata Police has reached Hyderabad
 itane bade-bade kaarobaaron se jude rahane ke baad bhi haadase ke baad is company kaa bayaan aata he ki yah 'act aaf god' he
 The bridge itself has destroyed the temple of God
 god to nahin magar godes kaali ke mandir kaa baramada bhi gir gaya he is naamuraad pul ke girane se
 This statement of the company has drawn much criticism in the human world
 god kii taraf se apane act par safai to nahin ai magar god ko is act main lapetane vaali company ne hyderabad main safai di ki ho saktaa he ki dhamaakaa hua ho
 Mirrors are broken
 company ko is pul ko banane ke liye pehali dedline 18 maheene kii di gai thi
 67 months passed
 IVRCL company jahaan deree ke liye kolkata metropolitan deveopment athurity ko samay par jagah nahin dene kaa jimmedaar tehraati he vahiin kolkata metropolitan deveopment athurity kaa aarope he ki company bahut dhire kaam kar rahi he
 But what is the charge right now
 aarope yah nahin he ki pul banane main itnaa samay kyon laga
 The allegation is how the sixty meter section of the bridge collapsed
 wo bhi nayaa vaala hissaa kaise gira
 In fact, IVRCL, which formed the sports village for the Hyderabad National Games in 2002, is badly hit by debts and losses
 company par kareeb 10,000 karod kaa qarj he
 In 2015 December, its loss has been 2000 crores
 company pul ke nirmaan kii lagaat badhwaana chaahati thi
 It is difficult to say whose claims are right and what is wrong, but 25 people have lost their lives due to the fall of the bridge
 kolkata main company ke 8 logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he, lekin agar pul banane main deree kii jimmedaar sarkari athurity hai to unhen bhi baksha nahin janaa chahie
 The comments ab aate hai aaj ke sawaal par
 Are flyovers so important that we make them anywhere
 desh bhar main fliover ko dekhenge to aapako aise bahut se fliover milenge to dhang ke bane hon
 Seeing some flyovers in small towns makes one nervous
 har jagah trephic jam kii samasya badhati ja rahi he
 Leaders also lay the foundation of the plyover to reassure the people
 dilli main jahaan pichley das-pandrah saalon main sau ke kareeb fliover to bane hi honge
 i can tell from the experience of this city that some flyovers seem successful but even after the formation of most flyovers, the problem of jam does not end
 mumbai main 50 fliover banane kii baat do dashak se chal rahi he
 There are 40 flyovers in Bengaluru
 chennai main bhi khub fliover bane hai
 You keep looking at the photographs of the foundation and inauguration of the flyover in newspapers every day, but have you ever seen whether they will solve the problem of traffic or not
 trephic ke alaava yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki fliover kii vajah se aasapaas kii saamaajik vyavastha bhi prabhavit hoti he
 The environment will also be affected
 kya aapako bhi lagata he ki fliover aane ke baad se trephic jam kii samasya samaapt ho gai he
 In my own experience both these things are there
 agar dilli ke sarai kaale khan se trephic kaa hal nahin hua he to gajipur fliover banane se kaaphi kuch hal hua he
 Now come to company inkaa naam he IVRCL
 The company is headquartered in Hyderabad
 iske paas 3000 ejeeniyar hai

 Are flyovers so important that we make them anywhere

 Seeing some flyovers in small towns makes one nervous
 har jagah trephic jam kii samasya badhati ja rahi he
 Leaders also lay the foundation of the plyover to reassure the people
 dilli main jahaan pichley das-pandrah saalon main sau ke kareeb fliover to bane hi honge
 i can tell from the experience of this city that some flyovers seem successful but even after the formation of most flyovers, the problem of jam does not end
 mumbai main 50 fliover banane kii baat do dashak se chal rahi he
 There are 40 flyovers in Bengaluru
 chennai main bhi khub fliover bane hai
 You keep looking at the photographs of the foundation and inauguration of the flyover in newspapers every day, but have you ever seen whether they will solve the problem of traffic or not
 trephic ke alaava yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki fliover kii vajah se aasapaas kii saamaajik vyavastha bhi prabhavit hoti he
 The environment will also be affected
 kya aapako bhi lagata he ki fliover aane ke baad se trephic jam kii samasya samaapt ho gai he
 In my own experience both these things are there
 agar dilli ke sarai kaale khan se trephic kaa hal nahin hua he to gajipur fliover banane se kaaphi kuch hal hua he
 In fact, IVRCL, which formed the sports village for the Hyderabad National Games in 2002, is badly hit by debts and losses

 In my own experience both these things are there
 agar dilli ke sarai kaale khan se trephic kaa hal nahin hua he to gajipur fliover banane se kaaphi kuch hal hua he
 Now come to today's question
 kya fliover itane jaruri hai ki ham kahin bhi kaise bhi bana dete hai
 If you look at flyovers across the country, then you will get many such flyovers, if made of style
 chote shaharon main kuch fliowaron ko dekhakar to ji ghabara hi jaataa he
 The problem of traffic jams is increasing everywhere
 netaa bhi logon ko aashwast karne ke liye pliover kii aadharshila rakh dete hai
 In Delhi, in the last ten-fifteen years, close to a hundred flyovers would have been built
 is shahar ke anubhav se bataa saktaa hum ki kuch fliover to kaamyaab lagate hai lekin zyaadaatar fliover ke banane ke baad bhi jam kii samasya samaapt nahin hoti he
 Talk of building 50 flyovers in Mumbai has been going on for two decades
 bengalooru main 40 fliover ban gaye hai
 There are also plenty of flyovers in Chennai
 aae din akhabaaron main fliover ke shilanyas or udghaatan kii tasviren aap dekhte rahete hai lekin kya kabhi dekha he ki inase trephic kii samasya dur hoti bhi he yaa nahin
 Apart from traffic, it is also said that the flyover also affects the surrounding social system
 paryaavaran par bhi asar hota hi hoga
 Do you also think that the traffic jam problem has ended since the flyover came
 mere khud ke anubhav main to donon hi baaten hai
 If traffic has not been resolved from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi, then the Ghazipur flyover has solved a lot
 trephic ke alaava yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki fliover kii vajah se aasapaas kii saamaajik vyavastha bhi prabhavit hoti he
 The environment will also be affected
 kya aapako bhi lagata he ki fliover aane ke baad se trephic jam kii samasya samaapt ho gai he
 In my own experience both these things are there
 agar dilli ke sarai kaale khan se trephic kaa hal nahin hua he to gajipur fliover banane se kaaphi kuch hal hua he

 ) What will be the next stance of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on the decision of demonetisation? This is a question that no one knows the answer to, but everyone is speculating on this issue
 jahaan tak khud bihar ke mukhyamantri or janata dal (united) ke adhyaksh nitish kumaar kaa sawaal he, unhone spasht kar diya he ki 31 disambar ke din agar aap jawaab kaa intjaar kar rahe hai to aapako niraash haath lagegi
 Yes, but they will consult their party leaders on demonetisation and if needed, they will also take the opinion of economists
 lekin usase pehle bihar main guru govindsingh kii 350 veen jayanti par prakaash utsav or buddha dharm ke anuyaayiyon ke festival kaa safaltaapurvak aayojan karnaa unki pehali praathamikta he
 This means that both these important events will be concluded by 13 January
 iske baad hi notebandi par nitish kumaar ke nae rukh kaa pataa chal paaegaa
 However, Nitish Kumar has currently made it clear to his political rival BJP and the allies in power, Rashtriya Janata Dal and Congress, that they are not going to reconsider their action on this issue under any pressure, hence the principle of demonetisation While the support is intact, there are questions about its implementation from public forums
 somvaar ko nitish kumaar ne do took shabdon main centre kii cashles arthvyavastha ko bhi is aadhaar par khaarij kar diya ki yah bhartiya samskruti or mizaaj ke vipareet he
 Actually, Nitish does not want to change his steps on this issue based on media reports because he knows that people are facing problems
 bihar ke majdoor waapas apane gaanv lautne par majaboor hai 
 
 vikaas ke kaam par pratikul asar padaa he
 Despite this, there is no public outrage
 agar gussa bhi hai to ve andolit nahin hai
 Due to demonetization, there was no law and order problem anywhere in Bihar
 yah bhi ek sanyog he ki nitish kumaar notebandi kii ghoshnaa ke baad se hi bihar ke vibhin jilon main apni nishchay yatra ke silsile main gum rahe hai
 So far he has not seen any such incident of public dissatisfaction and resentment forcing him to reconsider his decision

 Right now the assessment of the leaders of Janata Dal (U) is that gradually the problem of the people is getting reduced and the section of poor deprived people is happy with the problem of the big people
 nitish kumaar ke stand se unke sahyogiyon main bechaini he
 Congress may not be familiar with the nature of Nitish Kumar, but Lalu Yadav knows that it is not easy to change his stand by putting pressure on Nitish Kumar
 haalanki lalu yadav nishchit rup se nitish kumaar ke notebandi par samarthan ke rukh ke kaaran congress party se apane sambandh madhur karne main safal rahe hai or saath hi muslim samudaay main bhi unki paith or majboot hui he

 Nitish Kumar has discomfort among his colleagues from the stand
 congress nitish kumaar ke swabhaav se parichit ho na ho lekin lalu yadav ko maaloom he ki nitish kumaar par dabaab daalkar unka stand badalawaanaa aasaan nahin he
 However, Lalu Yadav has certainly been able to strengthen his relations with the Congress party due to Nitish Kumar's stand on demonetisation and at the same time his penetration in the Muslim community has also strengthened
 nitish jaanate hai ki muslim samudaay har mudde par pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf aakraamak rukh kii apeksha rakhata he jise puraa kar paanaa sambhav nahin
 Nitish will also refrain from raising the flag of protest to keep only one section of the people happy on every issue because he realizes the ground truth that it also has a counter-polarization that is responsible for all the failures and promises of the Bharatiya Janata Party Failure to complete may cover the failure
 tippaniyan Nitish's stance on demonetisation is being speculated by linking softness to his future political reconciliation, but political experts believe that even when Nitish Kumar was running the government with BJP, he avoided avoiding fencing on every issue with Congress
 Were
 isliye jab bijepi jiesti kaa virodh kar rahi thi tab ve uske samarthan main the
 At the same time, he supported Pranab Mukherjee on the issue of presidential election
 lekin uskaa matlab yah nahin tha ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress party se janata dal (you) ke saath unka koi talmail tha
 Nitish knows that credibility is a big capital in politics and he has the capital to take a stand on work and political issues besides his image
 nitish jo bhi kadam uthaaen, unhen maaloom he ki centre ko benami sampatti ke khilaaf karrvaai kii unki maang par aaj nahin to kal kadam uthaanaa padegaa or iskaa shrey unhen hi jayega
 Apart from this, during his 11 years of rule in Bihar, several steps were taken against corruption, such as seizing the houses of corrupt officials and opening schools there
 haalanki marketing ke abhaav main yah baaten bihar main hi simit rah gayi
 Now they must be feeling that if the Modi government is serious against corruption, then Bihar model will have to be adopted sooner and maybe this will be the real proof of their move on the issue of demonetisation

 Questions have been raised about the safety of children in schools across the country after the killing of a seven-year-old innocent Pradyuman at Ryan International School in Gurugram
 dilli or ensiaar ke skulon main padhane vaale bacchon ke abhibhavakon main dar kaa maahaul he
 People fear that something may go wrong with their child
 'ajtak' kii team ne bhi dilli ke kai skool kii padtaal kii he, is padtaal se saamne aayaa ki abhibhavakon kaa bharosa skulon se uthne laga he
 CCTV cameras not in buses An investigation into the safety of children in buses at Jindal School in Punjabi Bagh, Delhi, revealed that the buses did not have CCTV cameras
 jab hamaari team ne skool prabandhan se sisitivi se sambandhit sawaal poocha to unhone jhooth bolte hue kaha ki camere lage hue hai jabaki bas kii padtaal karne par unka jhooth pakadaa gaya
 That is, there is a big difference in the claims and truth of schools
 bina ID ke skool main entrirajouri garden main sthit cambridge skool main jab hamaari team ne padtaal kii to saamne aayaa ki yahaan skool ke baahar sisitivi camere to lage hue hai lekin jab parents se hamane baat kii to unka kahana tha ki hamaare bachche skool main surakshit nahin hai
 Investigation revealed that drivers and conductors without ids enter inside the school
 bacchon kii canteen main bhi driver-conductor kii awajahi par koi roak nahin he
 Parents of the CCTV school not engaged in the class said that CCTV cameras have not been installed outside the class room
 skool kii chuttee ke vakt donon get khol die jate hai or koi bhi aasaani se bina kii jaanch-padtaal ke skool ke bheetar daakhil ho saktaa he
 Parents say that it is playing with the safety of our children
 bacchon ko laate hai privet vaahnaskulon main jo sabase badi laaparvaahee dekhne ko mili vah bacchon ko laane-lejaane main istemaal hone vaali gadiyon main thi
 Taxis carrying children daily are of private number
 niyam ke mutabik skool se bacchon ko laane valigadiyon kaa commercial rezitreshnaur number hona chahie kyonki privet number kii gaadiyaan iske liye aadhikarik nahin hai or un gadiyon kii koi jaanch nahin hoti
 Whereas commercial vehicles are tested every year and have fitness tests
 lekin is maamle main parents ko bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie kyonki vahi apane bacchon ko in nijee vaahanon main bhejte hai
 It is clear from the investigation that the safety of children is being played with in schools
 abhi ek dardanaak haadasa hua he to sabhi kaa dhyaan in sabhi binduon kii ore gaya he lekin aae din aise haadase hote rahete hai
 In order to prevent such accidents, it is necessary that the school management pay serious attention to it and the parents should also be alert and try to remove these flaws in the school

 On the other hand, in Australia, Harbhajan, who is sitting on the bench and does not fit in the team combination, has been given a place in the team, the main reason is the captain, because he trusts Bhajji
 kaash! yahi bharosa irfan khan ke prati hota
 Irrfan, who once stunned the batsmen with his great swing and then surprised him with his strokes, also performed well recently in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, but it has no effect on the selectors and the Indian think tank
 Is annoying

 Will a talent like Irfan have to wait the same? The comments is tarah ham pate hai ki chayankartaaon or captain ne ek defensive team chuni he

 Harbhajan Singh did not do anything special against South Africa in the home series, it seems that he too is just being fed in the shadow of the 'past'
 unki jagah olerounder gurkirat maan ho sakate the, kyonki bhartiya maidaanon main unka pradarshan shandaar he or vah ek ‘package’ khilaadi hai
 And finally Pawan Negi
 ham us khilaadi ke bare main kya kahen, jisaki lottery lagi ho
 MP Jalaj Saxena has been performing well in batting and spin bowling long before him, but perhaps the distance from Chennai and Delhi and the average performance of his team has faded his performance
 or aakhir main pawan negi
 What can we say about a player who has a lottery
 mapra se khilne vaale jalaj saxena unase kaaphi pehle se ballebaaji or spin gendbaaji main shandaar pradarshan karte aa rahe hai, lekin shaayad chennai or dilli se adhik duuri or unki team ke ausat pradarshan ne unke pradarshan ko feekaa kar diya he

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Sunday listed the achievements of the Congress government in Delhi
 unhone dilli main pichley 15 saal main hue vikaas kaaryon or upie sarkaar ke mahatvakankshi khaadya suraksha vidheyak kaa zikr karte hue pravasi matadaataaon tak pahunch banane kaa prayaas kiya
 Nearly one third of Delhi's population is migrant voters
 kaam or rojgaar kii talash main khaskar bihar, uttar pradesh or uttarakhand se dilli aakar bas gayi logon ko diye sandesh main rahul ne kaha, ‘jo log baahar se aate hai, ham unke haathon main haath daalkar unke saath aage badhate hai
 While praising Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit for the development works in the state, Congress Vice President Rahul condemned the opposition for ignoring development issues
 rahul gandhi ne ravivaar ko apane bhaashan main danga prabhavit mujffarnagar main muslim yuvaaon se iesai dwaara sampark saadhe jane ke apane bayaan par uthe vivaad kaa koi zikr nahin kiya
 Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi was addressing the gathering in Patna along with Rahul's Delhi rally
 modi ne rahul par nishaanaa sadhate hue jhaansi kii raily main kaha tha ki yaa to unhen muslim yuvakon ke naam bataane chahie yaa apane bayaan ke liye saarvajanik rup se maafee maangani chahie
 Rahul Gandhi, who was focused on the issues of Delhi government patted for metro and airport, said that the model of Delhi Metro is being adopted in other countries like Indonesia
 upie sarkaar ne dillivaasiyon ko ek chamakta hua vishwastareey hawaldda diya he

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that the Reserve Bank of India has enough cash, which will be available even after December 30
 lekin kya notebandi ke elaan vaale din yani 8 november ko bhi halaat aise hi the? hakeekat main us din nae noton kaa anupaat radd kiye gaye noton kii tulana main ek-chauthai se kam yani sirf 24
 Was only 11%
 yahi nahin soochna ke adhikaar se mili jaankaree ke mutabik us din arabiai ke paas 500 kaa ek bhi nayaa note nahin tha
 The Finance Minister has stated that "this decision was taken with complete preparation
 notebandi kii ghoshnaa ke baad ek bhi din aisa nahin hua, jis din arabiai ne banking pranali ke madhyam se paryaapt dhan kii aapurti na kii ho
 "but looking at the figures which have come, it seems that the Reserve Bank is also responsible for the long queues outside the bank and ATM during the demonetisation
 artiai se mili dastavejon ke mutabik 8 november ko bhartiya rigerv bank ke paas 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 or 1000 rupye ke kul 23,93,753
 39 crore notes were available, out of which not a single new note of 500 rupees was present in the Reserve Bank
 artiai kaaryakarta anil galgali ke mutabik jo purana stock tha usamen kareeb 24 lakh karod rupee kii karency uplabdh thi jisamen 500-1000 rupee ke noton kii keemat 21 lakh karod thi jisaki vajah se logon kii bahut takalif hui
 The value of 2000 new printed notes for scrap notes 4
 95 lakh karod tha
 That is, even after about one and a half months, if the queue is not getting short, then its big reason is bad luck
 artiai se mili aankadon se saaf he ki arthvyavastha ko lekar itnaa bada kadam uthaane se pehle na to puri sthiti kaa akalan kiya gaya or na hi samuchit upaay
 According to RTI activist Anil Galgali, the old stock was in the currency of about 24 lakh crore rupees, in which the value of 500-1000 rupee notes was 21 lakh crores, due to which people suffered a lot
 raddi noton ke aivaz main 2000 ke nae chape noton kaa mulya 4
 95 lakh crores
 yani kahin na kahin lagbhag dedh maheene baad bhi agar qatari choti nahin ho rahi to uski badi vajah badintjami bhi he
 It is clear from the data from RTI that neither the entire situation was assessed nor the appropriate measures taken before taking such a big step towards the economy

 In the Lok Sabha elections 2019, after being kept away from a possible SP-BSP alliance between Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress has sent a message to both big leaders of UP saying that ignoring the Congress party can be a dangerous mistake
 darasal, mayawati kii basapa or akhilesh yadav kii sapa ne loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main saath-saath chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya he, jiskaa aupchaarik elaan aaj yani shanivaar ko lakhanu main hoga
 If sources are to be believed, they say on the SP-BSP alliance that both have formed an alliance to prevent BJP from winning in the state
 haalanki, pehle upi main basapa-sapa or congress ke bich gathbandhan kii baat chal rahi thi, magar kuch dinon pehle dilli main mayawati or akhilesh yadav ke bich mulaakaat ne yah sanket de diye ki rajya main sapa or basapa ke bich gathbandhan hoga or congress ko isamen shaamil nahin kiya jayega
 However, sources have also informed that if the Congress agrees to two seats in the SP-BSP alliance, it will be kept together
 agar congress party gathbandhan se baahar rahati he to congress pravaktaa abhishek manu singhvi ne kaha ki parinaam bhugatne kii chetavanee di
 Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said, "let me make it clear that the aim of all like-minded parties is like Congress, to remove misrule from this country, remove dictatorship
" yah sabakaa samaan uddeshy he
 We have to work for this purpose
 aage unhonekaha ki har party kii jimmedaari hoti he ki vah us parinaam ko lekar talmail kaayam kare or use sunishchit kare
 Every such party is committed to doing so
 jo aisa nahin karte hai, unhen janata dwaara doshi tehraaya jayega
 He further said that his party should not be underestimated
 saath hi unhone daawa kiya ki uttar pradesh main congress kaa prajence or aadhaar he
 In fact, sources from NDTV said that these two big parties of Uttar Pradesh i
e
 SP-BSP will contest together in 37-37 Lok Sabha seats
 uttar pradesh main loksabhaa kii kul 80 siten hai
 The seats of Amethi and Rae Bareli will be left in the BSP-SP alliance and no candidate will be fielded there
 sapa-basapa ne congress ke liye ye donon siten chodi hai
 In Uttar Pradesh, the Congress should not underestimate anyone on the basis of their reach, presence and support
 congress rajya main ek sthapit party he 
 
 
 We can fall in difficult times, but ignoring us would be a dangerous mistake (mistake)
 bataa den ki akhilesh yadav ne enditivi se kaha tha ki sapa-basapa gathbandhan main congress shaamil hogi yaa nahin is par vah abhi kuch nahin bolenge, magar yah jarur kaha ki vah upi main congress ke liye do siten chhodane ke liye taiyaar hai
 Earlier, during an exclusive conversation with NDTV in Kannauj, the parliamentary constituency of wife Dimple Yadav, Akhilesh Yadav said on the question of taking the Congress along in this alliance being formed in UP that there is nothing i can say about the Congress
 congress rashtriya party he
 He is the leader of the Congress party in UP
 lekin gathbandhan main kis tareeke se saath hoga, yaa nahin hoga, abhi kah paanaa mushkil he
 Would you like the Congress to come together from the heart? On this question, he said that today i will not speak on it because tomorrow is an important day
 kal gathbandhan kaa elaan hona he
 When it comes to the alliance first, then something will be said
 main maanata hum ki bahut jaldbaaji nahin karnaa chahie
 Later, we will think about how to find a way forward
 kya yah bemail gathbandhan he ? yaa phir aap log modi het kii vajah se saath aae hai ? is sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue akhilesh ne kaha ki koi yah nahin kah saktaa he
 We are definitely fighting the BSP
 magar sambandh nahin kharaab the
 Not at all to me
 unhone kaha ki bijpi se sikh kar ham apana vot badhayenge

 But what has happened to the rest of India? Is there a hatred of Kashmiris within India that claims love for Kashmir? If not, why does he not demand the restoration of his fundamental rights? Does India, which dreams of buying land there, marrying its girls, want to enter it like a terrorist and aggressor or like a state of its own, where it is warmly welcomed? In India, where Kashmir is made an election issue, why is there no sensation about the politicization of Kashmir? Why does it seem that any person who talks sensitively towards Kashmir can be declared as a traitor? Why is it expected that if we talk about internet locked in Kashmir, people in jails there, then we will have to face fierce opposition from not only the government but also a large population of our own? This is the situation in Ayodhya

 In the next one year, the states of India will be equipped with the financial power, which will change not only the economic policies but also the face of politics in the country
 francisi lekhak victor hugo kehete the, us vichaar ko koi nahin roak saktaa jiskaa samay aa gaya ho

 Before Narendra Modi came to power, the Finance Commission had started the journey to increase the financial powers of the states, Modi abolished the Planning Commission and brought it to the destination

 Even after listening to Jaitley's speech, are you unaware of these things? Narendra Modi may not be able to clarify the new blueprint of decentralized economic policy planning by abolishing the Planning Commission, but he must end the dominance of the center in the sharing of economic resources gave

 The government has accepted its report before the budget, it is going to change the map of financial relations between the center and the states

 The central government will give them funds without wrapping them in terms and not only this, a new formula for sharing the share of resources of the central state will also be implemented which is made by looking at the modern needs

 bijepi kii ranneeti saaf he yaa to vah maanjhi kii sarkaar banawaye or use chalaae, jisaki sambhaavna kam dikhti he
 But the BJP would definitely like Manjhi to have a chance to prove his majority in the House, which would prove how many mlas are there with Manjhi
 agar vidhayak maanjhi ke saath jate hai, to bijepi chaahegi ki vah ek nai party banaae, jisamen argedy ke pappu yadav bhi ja sakate hai
 The BJP will fund Manjhi's party and will try to establish himself as a Mahadalit leader and will try to break into the Mahadalit vote of Nitish Kumar
 bijepi kii dikkat he ki bihar ke sabhi siton par unke paas majboot ummidavaar nahin he
 The reason is that till the last election, BJP and JDU used to fight together
 saal 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi 102 siton par chunaav ladi thi or jediu 141 siton par, bijepi in 141 siton par daanv khelnaa chaahati he
 She would like that more and more people of JDU be brought and contest elections on BJP ticket
 abhi bihar kaa sankat lanbaa chalaaya jayega, taaki nitish kumaar ko satta kaa laalchee sabit kiya jaae, kyonki mukhyamantri pad se hatane ke baad nitish kumaar ke saath tyaag kii chhavi jud gai thi, jo bijepi ke kisi bhi ranneeti par baari pad rahi thi
 The BJP may also want President's rule imposed and ruled indirectly
 bijepi yah kabhi nahin chaahegi ki nitish november tak mukhyamantri rahen or ek baar phir chizon ko thikthak kar den
 However, it has definitely happened in favor of Nitish Kumar that Lalu Yadav has come with him openly
 jahani taur par lalu ko nitish ko mukhyamantri ke taur par sweekaar karne main vakt laga, yahi cheez agar party kaaryakattaaon main ho jaae to nitish kumaar kii raah aasaan ho jaaegi
 It is also important that if the BJP forms Manjhi's government, it will have to support it
 chunaav ke vakt maanjhi ko chhodana bijepi ke liye bhi ghaatak hoga
 Therefore, the BJP will play the game of Bihar as a strategy, because after getting free from the Delhi elections, the focus of the BJP will be on Bihar and Amit Shah will definitely want to teach Nitish a lesson, because Nitish does not always stop from attacking Modi

 com First of all we try to see what Narendra Modi is not
 unke virdohi kuch bhi kahen, pradhanmantri kabhi bhi aviveki yaa jaldbaaji main faisla nahin lete hai, na hi unhen sanyog yaa kismat aajamaane ke shauk main daanv khilne or jokhim uthaane kii aadat he
 Now let's see what Modi is
 jo log unhen bakhubi jaanate hai or unke saath kaam karte hai, unke mutabik, ve har kaam ko anjaam dene main yakeen karte hai
 They are also very strict in getting work done
 unke virdohi unhen taanashaah kehete hai lekin unke saath kaam kar chuke mantri or naukarshah isse sahamat nahin
 According to him, the Prime Minister listens to everyone, asks relevant questions and is always ready to consider suggestions
 unamem kisi faisle par pahunchane ke pehle har napha-nuksaan ko taulne kii gajab kii kshamta he
 However, when Modi agrees on an issue, then he is ready to execute it with firm judgment, courage and perseverance
 unamem samay kii nabj ko bhaanpane kii adbhut kshamta he
 They do not leave any work incomplete, nor do they put a full stop
 ve kathani ko kerani ke jariye pesh karne ke siddhant main vishwaas karte hai
 India today-karvy Insights' latest country's mood opinion poll confirms this aspect of the prime minister's personality
 agast 2016 main desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan main endie kaa graph kuch upar chadhataa dikhaa, jabaki iske pehle do daur ke surveykshanon main siton se jude anumaanon main lagaataar giravat dikhi thi, lekin janvari 2017 ke surveykshan ke parinaam to pradhanmantri ke liye vaaki khushkhabari lekar aae
 This is the first major public opinion poll since demonetisation and people have clearly stamped Modi's decision
 is surveykshan ke mutabik, agar aaj chunaav karaayaa jaae to endie ko 360 siten milane kaa anumaan he jo agast main kiye gaye pichley surveykshan ke nateezon se 56 zyada he
 The most interesting thing is that BJP alone can win 305 seats out of 543 so that it will remain in majority in Lok Sabha and it will reduce its dependence on allies (see graph)
 modi kii lokapriyata main bhi ullekhneey badhotaree dikh rahi haih 65 pratishat log unhen pradhanmantri pad ke liye sarvshereshth maanate hai
 This figure is also showing an increase of 15 percentage points over the previous August
 unhone apane nikatatam pratidwandvi rahul gandhi ko bahut peeche chhod diya he jinhen sirf 10 pratishat vot hi mili
 The percentage of those considered "good" to "excellent" while evaluating Modi's performance has also risen to 69 compared to 53 percent recorded six months ago
 alam yah he ki 2014 main pehali baar pradhanmantri kaa pad grahan ke baad modi ne sarvshereshth pradhanmantri ke taur par desh ke sabase lokapriy do purv pradhanmantriyon—indira gandhi or atal bihari vaajapeyi se bhi zyada vot hasil kiye hai
 Before this, the popularity of Modi started to rise again in the survey of last August, it was because of his balanced dhoti-kurta budget which was in favor of the poor and farmers, besides being business friendly
 yah behad santulit soch kaa nateeja tha
 By shuffling his team, he gave a clear indication that his objective is to do meaningful and positive work
 unhone sansad ke donon sadanon main vastu or seva kar (jiesti) vidheyak ko safaltaapurvak paarit karaayaa or vipaksh ko saath lekar chalane kaa anokhaa hunar dikhaaya
 Modi has taken two major steps since the August survey
 ek, videsh niti ke morche par jab sitambar ke antim saptaah main unhone pakistan ko aatanki hamalon ke liye uksaane ke khilaaf chetavanee dene ke liye pakistan adhikrut kashmir main andar ghuskar sargical strike kaa aadesh diya
 And secondly, in November, he announced demonetisation to curb alleged black money and fake notes, which rocked the whole of India and the world
 vipaksh ne notebandi ko arthvyavastha ke liye tabaahi kaa naam dekar bharpoor aalochana kii
 But Modi remained firm on his resolve and said that 1
25 billion countrymen of India are fully supporting him
 taaja desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan ke nateezon se modi kii deshavaasiyon par aasthaa sahi sabit hoti he
 About 45 percent believe that demonetisation will help curb black money, while 35 percent think it will improve the economy
 is tarah kul 80 pratishat janata ne unke kadam ko samarthan diya he
 This situation has arisen when 55 per cent believed that the government could have implemented it better and 51 per cent believed it did more than it would have benefited
 modi ke kathor kadam ke sambandh main virodhabhasi samarthan ke peeche kaaran kya hai? agar dhyaan se dekhen to modi kaa bade noton ko band karne kaa faisla kisi sanak main katai nahin liya gaya tha
 Modi came to power in 2014 with a slogan to curb black money and bring back black money stashed in bank accounts abroad
 jab unhone padbhaar sambhala to unki sarkaar ne teji se videshi bainkon main jamaa kaale dhan se nipatane ke liye ek svaichhik aay ghoshnaa yojana pesh kii
 He warned the people that if it was not followed, it would suffer serious consequences and they would regret it later
 is bich, modi ne desh kii bank khaaton se rahit vishaal janata ke hit ke liye jan dhan khaaton kii sankhya main ijapha karne ke liye majboot abhiyaan chalaaya
 In this way they were preparing the role of large scale digital cash payments for future times
 phir, november main vah din aayaa jab achaanak unhone notebandi ke jinn ko saamne laa khadaa kiya, jiskaa uddeshy kaale dhan kaa safaya, jaali note ke kaarobaar or aatankwaad kaa poshan karne vaale dhan-kosh kaa khaatmaa tha
 However, demonetisation was not just an economic policy
 yah modi kaa pesh kiya gaya ek shaktishaalee rajnatik hathiyaar tha jiske jariye unhone saamaajik sanrachana kaa ek aisa paimaana pesh kiya jo 1980 ke dashak main mandal andolan ke baad se ab tak nahin dikhaa tha
 Modi came to power riding on the horse of development, but he knew that the possibility of mobilizing the public again through this is limited
 dilli main haar or khaskar bihar kii paraajay ne sanket de diya tha ki unka jaadu kam ho rahaa he
 Even Hinduist agendas like temples and cow protection were losing their luster
 pradhanmantri modi or unke salaahkaaron ne aise muddon par dhyaan kendrit karne kaa faisla kiya jo rashtrahit main to hon hi, saath hi vyapak samarthan bator len
 Issues that are above caste, religion and language
 haalanki, unke vikaas agenda main logon ko ek saath jodgaye kii shakti to thi, par notebandi kaa faisla usase bhi zyada taqatvar ban jayega, jiske tahat garib-amir aamane-saamne khadey ho jaaenge
 This feeling will arise in the minds of the underprivileged that now the money is not good for the people
 suvidhavihin varg paise nikaalane kii beshumaar asuvidha ke baavjood notebandi ko acha maanegaa
 According to the mathematics of Modi's team, this was the only step that would have defeated the pro-poor image of the Congress and could have saved the BJP from the tradesman and pro-rich image
 yahi vah hathiyaar tha, jiske jariye arvind kejariwal or aam aadmi party kii bhrashtachar virdohi chhavi ko matiamet kiya ja saktaa tha
 In addition, by promoting digital transactions, Modi could emerge as a leader who is able to identify India as a strong country on the world stage in the 21st century on the strength of nationalist ideas like "make in India"
 pakistan par kii gai sargical strike bhi modi ko ek aise netaa ke rup main sthapit kar gai thi, jiskaa lakshya bharat ko shaktishaalee bananaa he
 His opponents termed demonetisation as a short-lived political ploy of Modi, which he played to influence the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election result
 unhone yah bhi bhavishyavaanee kii ki notebandi ke kaaran na keval anaupchaarik kshetra ke lakhon logon kii naukariyaan khatm ho jaaengi balki iske kaaran arthvyavastha ko aisa nuksaan pahonchega, jisaki bharpai nahin ho sakegi
 The NDA government has to give credit to the fact that there were no incidents of violence or riots anywhere in long lines of people outside the banks
 notebandi se hone vaali pareshaaniyon par ek baar rundhe gale se apni baat rakhane ke alaava modi khud bhi kaaphi had tak shant or sanyat bane rahe
 He said in a conversation with India Today, "if you work with clear intention and clarity then the result will be such that everyone will see
 " desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan ke nattejey modi ke is akalan ko hi pusht karte hai ki tamaam ksht ke baavjood log notebandi ke faisle kaa tahedil se samarthan karte hai
 People in the survey also praised Modi for not being afraid to take risks
 in sab sakaaratmak pahaluon ke baavjood modi ke liye santusht ho jane kii koi vajah nahin he
 The survey shows that boragargari and corruption remain the subjects of most concern for the common people
 har saal ek karod rojgaar ke avasar paidaa karne kaa vaada abhi tak nahin puraa hua he balki naukariyaan ghat gai hai
 Then comes inflation and a new issue has been added to it - shortage of cash
 modi ke satta sanbhaalane ke baad berogari ke morche par sthiti badtar hui he, aisa maanane waalon kaa pratishat ab bhi 36 he
 People's concern over inflation has come down, but it is still a big issue
 saath hi log chaahate hai ki modi bhrashtachar or bhrasht netaaon ke khilaaf or sakht kadam uthaaen
 At the same time, there is no guarantee that with the public support for demonetisation, Modi will be able to win his party elections in Uttar Pradesh Assembly
 aam taur par kisi bhi vidhansabha chunaav main sthaneey mudde, jati sameekaran or rajya ke netaa ahm hote hai
 By the way, recently the general budget is about to come and the Prime Minister can use it to address some important general concerns like lack of jobs
 modi ne dikhaaya he ki jab kaam mushkilon se bharaa ho or chunautiyaan dher sari hon to ve purv lakshyon ko paane kii lagaataar koshishon kii badaulat na keval kamyaabi hasil karte hai balki un halaat se nae avasar paidaa kar lete hai
 It is said that luck favors courageous people
 ab tak to yah kahawat modi par puri tarah charitaarth ho rahi he
 Survey Methodology Karvy Insights Limited conducted a India today-karvy Insights opinion poll of the country
 yah desh bhar main kiya gaya sabase vyapak janamat surveykshan he or notebandi par raishumaari he

 However, there was a little surprise when the 26-year-old young Indian captain sent a heartfelt letter to legendary player Kumar Sangakkara for his contribution to the game
 gauratlab he ki sangakaara ne ravivaar ko test cricket main apni aakhri pari kheli thi
 Sangakkara's 15-year-long cricket career came to an end with the Test match played in Colombo
 antim pari main out hone ke baad cricket prashansakon ke saath-saath bhartiya khilaadiyon ne bhi pi sara ovel main unhen shandaar vidaai di
 Kohli wrote on the photo, in which he is seen shaking hands with this great Sri Lankan player, 'dear Kumar, i feel extremely proud that you are a good man first and given to me in cricket There are no words to describe your great contribution
 ' tippaniyan "you have inspired many people and shown them the way
 main khud ko bhaagyashaalee maanata hum ki mujhe aapaki peedi main khilne kaa avasar mila

 The special thing is that even though Kohli got a chance to play in the generation of Sangakkara, but when Sangakkara made his debut in Test cricket in 2000, Kohli was only 11 years old
 jis tarah se kai khilaadi is khel ke mahaan khilaadiyon ko dekhte hue bade hue hai, usee tarah se kohli ne bhi is mahaan srilankai khilaadi se kuch baarikiyaan avashya sikhi hongi

 This message is written entirely in the capital letter and it reflects how much Kohli has respect for Sangakkara (a player who is known for his runs as well as affable personality)
 khaas baat yah he ki bhale hi kohli ko sangakaara kii peedi main khilne kaa mauka mila ho, lekin jab sangakaara ne saal 2000 main test cricket main padaarpan kiya tha, us samay kohli maatr 11 saal ke the
 The way many players have grown up watching the great players of this game, similarly Kohli must have learned some nuances from this great Sri Lankan player

 faridabad loksabhaa kshetra main vaise to bijepi kii pakad majboot he
 But before the ticket distribution many contenders are emerging
 yahaan se maujuuda saansad or modi sarkaar main rajya mantri krishnapal gurjar pehle daavedaar ke taur par hai
 But senior Congress leader Avtar Singh Bhadana, who quit Congress and joined BJP, is also planning to contest from Faridabad
 haalanki unka kahana he ki bijepi alaakaman jo faisla legaa, wo unhen manjuur hoga
 Actually, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Krishna Pal Gurjar, riding on the kayak of Modi wave, beat Avtar Singh Bhadana
 60 lakh maton se parajeet kiya tha
 After this defeat, Avatar Singh Bhadana joined the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) and then joined the BJP in 2015
 uske baad party ne bhadaana ko 2017 main hue uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main mirapur seat se maidan main utaara, or unhone jeet hasil kii
 The decision left on the high command Avatar Singh Bhadana says that Faridabad is his workplace and he wants to contest the Lok Sabha elections from here
 ye ichha wo amit shah tak pahunchaa chuke hai
 But the final decision has to be taken by the party
 jo bhi faisla hoga wo unhen sweekaar hoga
 BJP mlas are currently active in the Faridabar Lok Sabha constituency and are constantly meeting the public
 lekin saarvajanik manch par wo apane pattey nahin khol rahe hai

 However, he says, i will contest from whichever seat the party high command says
 avatar singh bhadaana kii maane to faridabad main krishnapal gurjar se zyada wo lokapriy hai
 The political journey of Bhadana is significant that Avtar Singh Bhadana was elected MP from Faridabad Lok Sabha constituency for the first time in 1991 on a Congress ticket

 com / c8vlddxj3w— Priyanka Gandhi Vadra (@priyankagandhi)july 31, 2019lagaataar badhate dabaav ke baad bijepi ne aaropee vidhayak kuldeep senger ko party se nilambit kar diya he
 Police have registered an FIR against Sengar, his brother Manoj and eight others in a road accident case
 ravivaar ko hue haadase main peedita gambhir rup se ghayal ho gai or uski chachee or mausi kii maut ho gai
 One of the women killed in the accident, Unnao, was a witness in the rape case
 peedita kii maa ne aarope lagaaya yah durghnaa unki beti or anya ko khatm karne kii sajeesh thi
 on Sunday kitaab kaa naam-bhaag milkha bhagalekhak-milkha sinhasah lekhan-sonia sanvalkaprakashak-prabhaat prakashanmoolya-125 rupee (paperbaque)'bhaag milkha bhaag' or 'milkha singh' in donon hi naam ko parichay kii jarurat nahin he
 We have known Milkha Singh as 'flying Sikh' for years
 2013 main ai film 'bhaag milkha bhaag' main ham unke sangharsh kii kahani bhi jaan chuke hai
 In such a situation, the first question is that when we have met the story of Milkha Singh in the film, then why this legend? What is there in 152 pages that will compel us to read it and is it that the struggle and success story of Milkha Singh is completed in just 152 pages? Actually, the questions were many and it is necessary to read the book to answer the questions Was
 to kitaab ke pannon ko palatney kii prakriya shuru hui or jo pehali line mujhe dikhin unamem likhaa tha- mitaa de hasti ko agar koi martabaa chaahe, ki dana khaak main milakar gul-e-gulzaar hota he
 These are the first inscribed lines from the role at the beginning of the book
 lekin in panktiyon ko pustak main sabase pehle prakashit kyon kiya gaya, iskaa jawaab kitaab ke antim or 152wein panne main miltaa he
 Milkha Singh wrote in the 20th chapter of the book 'apocalypse', 'I am neither an author nor an author but an obsessive player, who has kept my heart open in this book
 ' yakeen maniye to kitaab ko padhane ke kram aapako bhi yahi ehsaas hota he
 Actually, this book is the hallmark of Milkha Singh's feelings, his thoughts and how to become his thoughts
 yah vaaki unka dil he, kyonki isamen kisi sadhe hue lekhak kii darshanik lekhnee nahin balki ek aam insaan ke safalataa ko praapt karne kii daastaan he
 In the course of reading a book, it is never felt that you are reading the autobiography of a great personality
 pannon ko palatnaa aisa he jaise milkha singh saamne baithe hai or vishuddh desi andaaj main aapako jivan kaa falsafa suna rahe hai
 Keeping your heart in front
 kitaab main nayaa kya hafilm 'bhaag milkha bhaag' or aatmakatha 'bhaag milkha bhaag' kaa aadhaar bhale hi ek ho, lekin andaaj or ruparekha alag-alag hai
 For example, there are many things or stories in the book that are not shown in the film and by reading the book it is known that there were many facts in the film which were actually used only as a form of entertainment
 udhaaharan ke taur par milkha singh kii jo prem kahani film main dikhaai gai vah puri tarah sahi nahin he
 The film does not mention Singh's views on marriage and life-partner
 na hi un ghatnaon kaa zikr he jab vah apni jeevansangini nimmi se milte hai
 Apart from this, there is a hurry in what is shown in the film about Pakistan and India and their family, especially the sister, while the book gives you the truth and the circumstances then
 dil kii batamilkha singh ne apane jivan ko 20 adhyay main baanta he
 There are many chapters in them, in which they have really kept their heart open
 kehane kaa arth yah he inamen unhone vah baaten kahi hai jo unhone mahasoos kiya yaa jo unke vichaar hai
 There is joy, sorrow, anger, resentment and hope
 phir baat chaahe nehru ji se mulaakaat ke pal kii ho yaa khel prashasan or khel main raajnneeti kii
 Milkha Singh has expressed her opinion from Babaki through the book
 unhone kitaab main spasht likhaa he ki khel kaa jis tarah raajnneetikaran ho rahaa vah khel or khiladiyon ko galat disha main le ja rahaa he
 He writes about how he has not been liked in sports organizations' meetings and how people like him who have never been associated with sports sit on the post like president
 kyon padhaa javogar aap rupahale parde se itar sahi myne main milkha singh se prerit hai to yah kitaab aapke liye he
 If you are fond of reading autobiography then this book is for you
 agar aap ek darshanik aatmakatha kii bajaay ek saral, sapaat lekin tathyaatmak lekhan padhanaa chaahate hai to yah kitaab aapke liye he
 If you are interested in sports then this book can inspire you
 agar aapke paas padhane ke liye kam samay he or ek acchhee kitaab padhanaa chaahate hai to yah 152 panne aapke liye hai
 
 
 
 or ant mechant main kitaab kii wo antim panktiyaan likhnaa chaahunga, jisase milkha singh ne apni aatmakatha ko samaapt kiya he
 He writes- 'life as a player is hard
 lekin nishchit rup se aisa samay aata he, jab aap ise chhodane yaa shortkats lene kaa prayaas karne kii ore aakarshith hote hai
 Remember that there is no shortcut to success
 yadi sheersh tak pahunchnaa he to apane astitv ko samaapt kar do, kyonki anaaj ke dane ko ankurit hone ke liye dhul main milanaa hota he or phir phool banakar khilanaa hota he

 ham 70 saal main olympic khel main kul 28 medal laa paae hai, usamen 9 hi gold he
 There are 7 silver and 12 bronze medals
 china ko 2016 ke hi olympic main 70 medal mili

 It will fulfill the dream of players from all over the country
 yah desh ke logon kaa sapana puraa karne kaa yah mile kaa pathar hoga

 bataa den ki hyderabad main riginal comprihensive iconomic partnership (kshetreey vyapak aarthik bhagidaari yaa RCEP) ke liye 16 deshon ke 100 se zyada adhikari ikattha honge
 India and China will also attend this meeting to be held next week
 is baithak main asia kendrit trade deal par 16 deshon ke bich baatcheet hogi
 Among the big players in this group are China and India
 haalanki donon deshon ke bich seemaa tanaav ko lekar muththiyaan bhinchi hui hai
 The challenge for both countries is not to let the border dispute become a barrier between trade agreements
 chini media kaa kahana he ki 2012 main china or japan ke bich diyaou iceland ko lekar tanaav tha, japan ne is dweep ko neshnalise karne kii koshish kii, jabaki china bhi ise apana samprabhu kshetra bataata rahaa he
 This tension between the two countries was also seen in trade and the china-japan-south Korea Free Trade Agreement was postponed
 2015 main china or dakshin korea ne alag se dwipaksheeya free trade agreement sin kiya
 It was believed that if there was a free trade agreement between japan-china-south Korea, the economy of the three countries would have benefited a lot
 china kaa kahana he ki RCEP ko is tarah kii sthiti se bachanaa chahie
 That is, it is clear that China does not want the border dispute with India to be a hindrance
 global times ne likhaa he ki china apane samprabhu kshetra par adhikaar ko lekar koi samjhauta nahin karegaa, lekin vah apane padosi deshon ke saath seemaa vivaad ko baatcheet ke jariye hal karne ke liye puri tarah drudh pratijna he
 Promoting any dispute would be fatal for both countries

 loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ne is par kaha ki desh main sanvaidhanik sankat paidaa ho gaya he or pataa hi nahin chal rahaa ki rail mantri koun he

 At the same time, the Left also demanded the government to explain the situation
 sipiai ne kaha, janata ko lag rahaa he sarkaar kamjor he
 Trinamool Congress MP Sudeep Bandopadhyay said that Trivedi's case is a matter of Mamata and her party and the party has never asked Trivedi to resign
 baad main vitt mantri pranab mukherjee ne bataaya ki rail mantri dinesh trivedi ne istipha nahin diya he lekin trinmul congress kii netaa mamata banerjee kii ore se pradhanmantri ko ek sandesh mila he jis par sakriy vichaar ho rahaa he
 Asked by the opposition to clarify the situation regarding the Railway Minister, the Leader of the House said, 'the members of the Opposition have raised some things about the Railway Minister, i have to say that the Railway Minister has not resigned
 is maamle main jab koi upyukt kadam uthaaya jaayegaa, tab sadan ko suchit kiya jaayegaa
 Attempting the opposition, especially BJP members, to behave like leaders, Pranab said that opposition members should not behave childishly who ran a coalition government in the worst way for six years
 vitt mantri ne kaha, ‘hamen pradhanmantri ko sambodhit trinmul congress pramukh kaa keval ek sandesh praapt hua he or sarkaar ne is par koi nirnay nahin kiya he
 Leader of the Opposition Sushma Swaraj said that the country is going through a constitutional crisis
 rail bajet pesh karne ke kuch hi ghante baad rail mantri ke istife kii khabar aati he
 Another minister (harish Rawat) resigns and sits in Kopbhavan
 sarkaar bataaye ki abhi dinesh trivedi rail mantri hai yaa nahin
 Whether the Railway Budget presented on Wednesday is alive or not? Pranab said that the Railway Minister has not resigned
 rail bajet ke liye pradhanmantri kii manjuuri kii jaruri nahin hoti, cabinet kii manjuuri kii jarurat nahin hoti
 It receives the approval of the Finance Minister
 ‘vitt mantri ke rup main main rail bajet kii jimmedaari letaa hum
 It is now the property of Parliament and the House has to consider it
 ’ sushamaa ne sarkaar se yah spasht karne ko kaha tha ki rail bajet kii jimmedaari kiski he

 The party leader and the Prime Minister will resolve this issue

 JD u president Sharad Yadav said that transparency and openness are necessary in a democracy

 Sharad said that if the government runs, then i go with Iqbal, such a pull is not right
 makapa ke vasudev acharya ne kaha ki sthiti kaaphi gambhir he jab rail bajet pesh karne ke baad rail mantri ko istipha dene ke liye kaha jaataa he
 The ministers in the government sit on a dharna in the Parliament premises demanding the resignation of their party minister
 pradhanmantri ko is vishay par sthiti spasht karnaa chahie
 cpi's Gurudas Dasgupta said, "we also support the Trinamool Congress' demand to withdraw the increase in railway passenger fares
 rail yatri kiraaye main vruddhi ko waapas liya janaa chahie
 But the question here is the collective responsibility of the cabinet, it has been violated
 ’ unhone kaha ki yah sarkaar kamjor he, isse pehle kabhi rail bajet ke baad rail mantri se istipha dene ko nahin kaha gaya or na hi sarkaar ke mantri kabhi dharna par baithe
 Petrol and diesel prices in the country are moving towards a century
 janata main ise lekar kaaphi gussa he or vipakshi dal sarkaar par hamalavar hai
 In such a situation, the question arises that why the government is not doing anything? Can the government do anything? Does it have an option? Actually, the government currently has three options to check petrol and diesel prices, but all three are very difficult
 sarkaar or bhartiya janata party ko yah abhas he ki petrol or dijal kii badhati keemton se unhen nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Petrol and diesel prices are at their all-time highs
 mangalvaar ko dilli main petrol 76
 Rs 87 per liter and diesel 68
 08 rupee prati litre tha
 Let us know what are the options before the government
 
 
 ek rupaya bhi tex gata to 13,000 karod kaa nuksaanapahala vikalp yah he ki centre or rajya sarkaron dwaara lagaae jane vaale exise duty or waite ko ghataya jaae
 If we look at the data till April, the price of petrol the consumer pays is 47% tax and diesel is 38% tax
 lekin samasya yah he ki tex main sarkaar agar ek rupee kii bhi kami karti he to uske khajaane main salanaa 13,000 karod rupee kaa nuksaan hota he
 Therefore, neither the Central Government nor the State Governments are able to dare for this
 to dilli main petrol kii keemat hogi 45
 75 per liter! Another option is to bring fuel to GST
 yah lollypop to kaaphi samay se dikhaaya ja rahaa he, lekin abhi tak sambhav nahin ho paaya he
 It is a bitter medicine for both the central and state governments
 agar petrol par 18 fisadi kaa bhi jiesti tay kar diya jaae to dilli main petrol kii keemat ghatakar 45
 75 per liter
 lekin iske liye centre or rajya sarkaron ko bahut bada kalejaa dikhaanaa hoga
 This is because of the huge earnings from tax on oil
 petroleum par tex se lakhon karod kii yeendhan ko jiesti ke tahat laane se sarkaar ko kar rajasav main kareeb 2 lakh karod rupee kaa nuksaan hoga
 It is noteworthy that from the tax on fuel, the central and state governments in the year 2016-17 4
 63 lakh karod rupee kaa rajasav mila tha
 Deal with OPEC countries The third option depends on the geopolitical scenario of the world
 bharat, japan or china un asian deshon main shaamil hai, jo opek deshon se kachche tel kii kharid ke liye oonchi keemat dete hai
 This is called the 'asian Premium' and can be as high as 3 to 8 dollars per barrel
 yah dastur saal 1987 se chal rahaa he
 Asian countries have been threatening that they will mobilize and buy crude, but so far this has not been done
 isliye agar bharat aise kisi golbandi main shaamil ho paaya or opek ne asian premium ko hataane par sahmati jataai to bharat sarkaar iske bharose apane tex main katautee kar sakati he
 In the international market, the price of crude oil has reached 80 barrels per dollar
 april tak bharat kaa jo crude basket 52
 It was now $ 49 a barrel, it has now crossed $ 72, which means that India is getting crude oil at this price
 crude kii keemat yadi 100 dollar ko paar karti he to is puure saal main bharat ko ausatan 93 dollar prati bairal ke hisaab se kaccha tel milegaa
 This will be exactly double the level of 2016-17
 philhal to aisa nahin lagata ki sarkaar tex main koi katautee karne kii soch bhi rahi he
 Recently, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on a question about this, 'this is not possible
 gaanvon main sadakenkaise banengin? yadi rajya sarkarein petroleum utpaadon par koi tex na lagaae to gaanvon main vikaas kaise hoga? philhal to sabase aasaan rasta ho saktaa he ki sarkarein dhire-dhire kramik rup se exise or waite ko ghataaen

 ) 29 april ko kalburgi main ek chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue bies yediurppa ne elaan kar diya tha ki vah 17 may ko karnataka ke mukhyamantri ke pad kii shapath lenge
 This claim also proved to be true after Yeddyurappa was sworn in as Chief Minister on Thursday
 shapath lene ke baad yediurppa ne kaha ki vah bahumat sabit karne ke liye 100 fisadi aashwast hai
 The BJP has emerged as the single largest party by winning 104 seats in the Karnataka Assembly elections but despite this the BJP is 8 mlas away from the majority
 vahiin, congress or jedies nateezon ke baad gathbandhan kar 116 ke aankade par pahunch gaye hai
 Governor Vajubhai Vala has given Yeddyurappa 15 days to prove his majority in the assembly
 ab yaheen se shuru hoti hai siem yediurppa kii asli parikshabijepi ne supreme court or iske baahar bhi yahi tark diya he ki vah sadan main bahumat sabit kar degi
 This claim implies that the BJP is expecting a change of party from the newly elected members of Congress or JDS or both parties
 haalanki, bhartiya raajnneeti ke itihaas main is tarah kaa dal-badal nayaa nahin he
 In the 1980s, the trend of party-change increased so much that Parliament had to put a 10th schedule in the Constitution through the '52nd Constitution Amendment Act'
 is 10veen anusuchee ko anti defections lau (dal-badal virdohi kanoon) ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Even after the legislation was enacted in 1985, amendments were made when the change could not be tightened completely
 2003 main yah tay kiya gaya ki sirf ek vyakti hi nahin, agar samuhik rup se bhi dal badla jaataa he to use bhi asanvaidhanik qaraar diya jayega
 Apart from this, Section 3 was also abolished in the same amendment, under which a party could be changed with one third party members
 ab aisa kuch karne ke liye do tihaai sadasyon kii sahmati jaruri he
 What two more Congress mlas who have disappeared from the resort say Anti Defection Law (anti-defection law)? The second paragraph of the schedule clarifies the basis for disqualification under Anti Defection Law - if any MLA voluntarily belongs to the party
 If he resigns, he should vote against the directive issued by the party or abstain from voting
 nirdaleey ummidavaar ayogy qaraar de die jaaenge agar vah kisi raajnneetik party main shaamil ho jaaenek party kaa vilay duusari party main ho saktaa he lekin iske liye kam se kam party ke do-tihaai vidhayakon kaa vot jaruri he
 Yeddyurappa announced the debt waiver of farmers as soon as he took the oath, in the past, the Supreme Court has also made clear in the Constitution 'voluntarily relinquishing party membership'
 party ke jari nirdesh ke khilaaf voting karne yaa voting se dur rahane ko lekar bhi court ne vyakhya di he
 In 'ravi Nayak v
 Union of India', the Supreme Court ruled that voluntarily quitting membership is not a resignation, but rather a more detailed explanation
 koi sadsy kisi raajnneetik party se swechha se apni sadsyta chhod saktaa he bhale hi usne party kii sadsyta se istipha naa diya ho
 In another judgment, the Supreme Court had said that if a legislator of a party submits a letter of support to the Governor to another leader outside his political party to form the government, it will be presumed that that member has given his membership of the party Voluntarily abandoned is tarah se agar congress yaa jedies kaa koi bhi vidhayak floor test main yediurppa sarkaar ke paksh main vot karata he yaa phir samarthan patr detaa he to use dal-badal mana jayega
 However, in such a situation, the Speaker of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly will decide whether the member is guilty under the Anti Defection Law
 karnataka main bijepi kii sthir sarkaar banane ke liye ek doosraa rasta bhi he
 Will Operation Lotus revisit Naiya? In Karnataka, 'operation Lotus' has suddenly become a topic of discussion
 2008 main bijepi kuch aisi hi paristhiti main funs gai thi, tab bijepi kii ranneetik chaal ko oparation lotus kaa naam diya gaya tha
 In that election too, the BJP was far from the majority figure
 karnataka vidhansabha main bahumat pareekshan se pehle jedies or congress ke 6 vidhayakon ne apni sadsyta se istipha de diya tha
 In the subsequent by-elections, those mlas contested on a BJP ticket
 congress or jedies ne aarope lagaaya tha ki bijepi ne unke vidhayakon kii kharid farokht kar lee thi
 According to the report, the JDS is troubled by the possibility of a turnaround during Siddaramaiah's reign over alleged appeasement of Lingayats and neglect of the Vokkaliga community
 bijepi kii ummid jedies ke congress virdohi vidhayakon par tiki hui he
 On the other hand, some pro-lingayat Congress mlas, especially mlas from Bombay Karnataka region, are also said to be ready to 'help' the BJP under 'operation Lotus'

 chhattisgarh ke raipur sthit sarkari doctor bhimrao ambedkar medical college samet do nijee aspataalon ko pichley saal 325 ankhen daan main milin thim
 These eyes were donated by the family of the deceased, inspired by the eye donation fortnightly and the campaigns launched from time to time, but out of these only 120 eyes could be put to the blind, the rest became useless and were thrown away
 netra daan ke maamle main pichley 10 saal se in aspataalon ko salanaa 300 se zyada ankhen daan main mil rahi hai
 In them, more than one-third of the eyes were set up for the blind
 baaki ke bare main jimmedaardoctoron kaa daawa heki ye ankhen research ke liye medical chaatro ko saupi gai
 This claim of doctors seems to be surprising
 doctor to yah bhi kah rahe he ki research ke baad ankhon ko phenk diya jaataa he
 During this, after taking stock of the research conducted on the eyes, it was found that on an average two thousand eyes were used for research in 10 years, but the serious thing is that not a single student has submitted the thesis
 haal hi main ek maatr chaatr ne thisis jamaa karne main dilchaspee dikhaai
 It is being told that every year 175 to 200 students of medical college do research on the eyes
 research kaa kya phayda ho rahaa he, is bare main jimmedaar doctoron ne chuppi saadh lee he
 At present, RTI activists have asked for the details of the donated eyes

 jayalalita ne apni party ko lagaataar duusari baar satta dilwaai thi, jo rajya ke chunavi itihaas main ek record rahaa, kyonki usase pehle donon dalon ko baari-baari se satta hasil hoti rahi thi
 But this time the difference of victory of AIADMK against DMK was slightly less than the last time

 Jayalalithaa always held both these positions in the event of the party's victory

 Whether Panneerselvam will continue in his post or not
