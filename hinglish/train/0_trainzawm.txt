 Inaugurating the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Yojana in Gorakhpur, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave the reason for not deciding the loan waiver
 unhone kaha ki karjamaafee kaa faisla hamaare liye bhi bahut aasaan tha
 But only a few upper-level farmers could benefit from doing so
 piem modi ne kaha, 'hamaari sarkaar pradhanmantri krishi sinchai yojana par hi kareeb 1 lakh karod rupye kharch kar rahi he
 We are putting such a huge amount so that the irrigation projects in the country which were incomplete for 30-40 years, are hanging, can be completed
 hamane deshbhar kii 99 aisi pariyojnaayen chunin thim jisamen se 70 se zyada ab puri hone kii sthiti main aa rahi hai
 "many generations will get benefit," he said, "because of these projects, farmers are getting irrigation facilities on millions of hectares of land
 ye wo kaam he jo kisaanon kii aane vaali kai pidiyon tak ko laabh degaa
 By not completing irrigation projects, loan waiver was the easy way out
 lekin ki karjamaafee se sirf upree str ke kuch kisaanon kaa hi phayda ho paata
 Even those farmers who have taken loans from the bank, who would think of crores of farmers who take loans from someone else instead of the bank
 'PM modi ne kaha, 'in sinchai pariyojnaon ko puraa karne ke liye kahin koi pradarshan nahin hua tha, koi dabaav nahin tha
 By not completing irrigation projects, loan waiver was a very easy route
 lekin sachai yahi he ki karjamaafee se sirf upree str ke kuch kisaanon kaa hi phayda ho paata
 'we will send money to the list
 
 
 piem ne kaha ki desh ke 12 karod kisaanon ko kisaan yojana kaa sidhaa laabh milegaa
 Now farmers will not have to wander to buy seeds, fertilizers and medicines

 Under this, the first installment of two thousand rupees has been deposited in the farmers' account
 jin kisaanon ko pehali kist kii raashi nahin mili he unhen kuch hi samay main mil jaaegi
 For this, the state governments have to do nothing but make a correct list of farmers honestly
 hamaare paas jaise hi suchi aegi, ham paisa transfar kar denge
 He said, 'many state governments have taken initiative for this
 lekin kuch abhi bhi rajya sarkarein hai jo iske liye pahal nahin kar rahi hai
 i want to say that if you did not make a list of the farmers, then the miseries of the farmers will ruin your politics
 aapkaa virodhabhas hamaari party or hamaare saath ho sakati he lekin kisaanon ke saath kyon
 The Opposition has spread a rumor that Modi will still give 6 thousand rupees and will take Vafis again after one year
 lekin main aap sabhi ko kahata hum ki yah paisa aapkaa he or ise modi to kya koi bhi aapse waapas nahin le saktaa

 This is a photo of the hostel of the Jaish terrorists, on which the Indian Air Force was responsible for the attack
 gat 26 farvari ko kiye gaye balakot hamale kii prakashit sabhi tasveeron main se yah photo sabase adhik spasht he
 The roof of the house seen in the picture is sloping as is usually the case in hilly areas
 isamen se ek dhalaan vaali chat par teen nishaan saaf taur par dikhaai de rahe hai jinhen 'holes' kaha ja rahaa he
 The diameter of each such hole is one meter
 satellite image ke printout main yah saaf taur par darshaya gaya he
 This description has been included in the dossier, which Hindustan Times has described as the effect of the Balakot attack
 hindustan times ne kaha he ki, 'report ke anusaar targeton ke bich vah guest house, jisamen camp, marakaj yaa hostel ke daure ke dauraan aam taur par moulana masood ajahar, uskaa bhai abdul rauf ajahar or jaish-e-mohammad ke diggaj kartadharta rukate the dhwast kar diya gaya
 ' hostel jaish ke lambey-chaude ilaake ke uttari hisse main sthit he jisaki chaudaai 40 feet he
 Its description is mentioned in 'google Earth Pro'
 isaki lambaai kareeb 35 feet prathit hoti he
 The satellite image of a portion of the hostel was released by Reuters on March 4, six days after the Indian Air Force attack
 royatres dwaara saunpi gai satellite image main spasht rup se mitti kaa ek dhabba dekha ja saktaa he
 Sources say that apart from the hostels, two other buildings were also targeted
 'ek (bam) prashikshakon or senior hostel ke liye, or ek (bam) guest house ke liye
 "both these buildings are situated to the south of the grounds and are under the cover of trees
 jari kii gayi air strike ke pehle or strike ke baad main jari ki gaye photographon main yah spasht rup se dikhaai nahin detii hai
 However, the Air Force says that they have satellite photos that clearly indicate that these buildings have been attacked
 satellite imageri visheshgyon ne pehle kii reporton main kaha tha ki balakot camp main sabase badi sanrachana main bam ke hamale ke nishaan dikhaai de rahe the
 The structure was described as "hall"
 ab yah spasht nahin he ki haul par hamalaa kisi anya hathiyaar se kiya gaya tha yaa dikhaaya gaya nuksaan 3 spice 2000 bam ke visphot kaa parinaam he
 The WAPAN used in all cases is an Israeli-designed smart munition, called the Spice 2000
 yah ek lambii duuri kaa glide bam kaa hamalaa tha jisamen target ke liye satellite se gidence liya jaataa he
 This weapon, designed to prevent damage to the surrounding area during an attack, has its effect only in the three meter area around the target
 IAF ne spice 2000 ke ek penetrator vairient kaa istemaal kiya, jo ki chhaton or farsh ko bhed daalata he or tay kii gai gaharaai par jaakar visphot karata he
 According to a senior official, three vapons were dropped at a target (hostel), 1 of the points to hit
 5 se 3 meter ke bheetar the
 The other two vapons hit their targets accurately with no errors
 bhartiya vayusena ke is mishan main miraj 2000 vimaanon main chah vaipanon ko hamale ke liye shaamil gaya tha
 Five bombs were dropped and all five pierced their targets
 satellite imageri ko hasil karnaa bhartiya vaayu sena ke liye samasya rahaa he, NDTV ko pataa chalaa he ki sabase acchhee image ek mitra raashtra se hasilas ho sakin
 The government could not ascertain the situation from the satellite due to the presence of clouds near the target in Balakot during the hours after the Indian Air Force attack on the morning of 26 February
 yah spasht nahin he ki sarkaar kabhi bhi hamale kii tasviren jari karegi yaa nahin
 International media and security experts have questioned the success of the IAF attack on Jaish's training camp
 ve kehete hai ki vyavsaayik rup se uplabdh footage mahatvapurn kshati nahin dikhaate hai or yah bhi saaf taur par saamne nahin aa sakaa he ki koi sanrachana dhwast hui he
 Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Project at Middlebury Institute of International Studies, says, "high-resolution images show no evidence of bomb damage
 "bhartiya vaayu sena iskaa mukharata se pratikaar karti he
 a senior official has described NDTV as the way Spice 2000 works and said that weapons do not necessarily bring down all buildings
 ''yah ek simit kamare ke bheetar dabaav ke saath visphot se sabhi soft skin target ko martha he
 There is an advanced fuse option that can also count floors
 '' balakot ke maamle main, visphot se pehle do manjila imaarat ko bhedane ke liye kam se kam ek spice 2000 smart bam ko set kiya gaya tha
 It is still unclear whether the government will release satellite images of the Balakot attack or intends to provide further evidence on the number of terrorists eliminated
 haalanki, yah spasht prathit hota he ki tasviren koi bada dhamaakaa nahin dikhaati hai
 However, there is clear evidence of an accurate attack on selected targets within the terrorist hideout in Balakot

 Hundreds of children died due to acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in Muzaffarpur district of Bihar
 bacchon kii maut kaa jimmedaar lichi ko bataaya ja rahaa tha
 In Muzaffarpur, called a bowl of litchi, there has been a ruckus on litchi for three weeks
 puure desh main lichi kii bikri kam ho gai
 But, a big scientist of the country has denied that lychee causes encephalitis
 india today ko die intervyuu main lichi par shodh karne vaale santhaan neshnal research centre ke nideshak dow
 Vishalnath said that there is no connection between lychee and encephalitis
 aaie
 
 
 Know that Dr
 vishalnath ne or lichi or inseflitis ke liye maujuud koun-koun se bhram tode
 1
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki lichi main maujuud prakritik vishakt kii vajah se bihar main inseflitis ho rahaa he
 Children are dying from him
 kuch research or studies ne bhi kuposhan or lichi ke prakritik vishakt main sambandh bataaya he
 Do you agree? Lychee has nothing to do with encephalitis
 lichi kaa jo hissaa humlog khate hai usamen koi prakritik vishakt nahin hota
 It is unfortunate that people have been misinformed about lychees
 mujffarpur se lichi dilli or mumbai bhi jaataa he
 Also dispatched to other parts of the country
 aise main to puure desh main inseflitis failana chahie tha
 but that did not happen
 lichi behad paushtik fal he
 It contains vitamin-b, calcium, iron, potassium, phosphorus and other minerals
 mujffarpur sthit research centre main mujhe 11 saal ho gaye, lekin ajtak mujhe lichi kaa koi dushprabhav nahin dikhaa
 2
 kuch visheshgyon ne salaah di thi ki lichi kii vajah se inseflitis na ho, lekin garib pariwaron ke bachche khaali pet lichi khaakar so jate hai
 Does eating an empty stomach lychee cause AES? Many fruits like litchi, mango, guava are naturally acidic
 yah salaah di jaati he ki amleey falon ko khaali pet na khaaen
 It may cause some problems but no one can die
 lichi puure desh main 1 lakh hectare jameen par paidaa kii jaati he
 Only one-tenth of it (8000 to 10 thousand hectares) is produced in Muzaffarpur
 agar lichi kii vajah se bihar main 10 saal se kam umr ke bacchon ko inseflitis ho rahaa he, to yah desh ke anya hisson ke bacchon main bhi failana chahie tha
 Why should the poor, even the children of rich families get sick
 3
 a study by the Indian Academy of Pediatrics revealed that children ate litchi during the day and did not eat at night
 lichi main maujuud prakritik vishakt hypoglysine-e ne raat bhar main bacchon ke blad sugar kam kar diya, jisase unhen hypoglaikemia ho gaya
 It was seen that the children fell ill by the next morning
 kya aap is baat se sahamat hai?lichi ke beej main milane vaala mithail cychlopropil glysin (MPCG) amine acid main tabdeel ho jaataa he
 But it is not found in pulp of pulp
 isliye sawaal yah uthta he ki kyon koi lichi ke beej ko khayega or vah bhi itani maatra main kyo khayega
 There cannot be a deficiency of sugar in blood after eating litchi, because litchi contains sufficient amount of sugar
 eskeems main janvari se AES se peedit bachche aa rahe the
 Whereas, at that time there is no production of litchi
 4
 State Agriculture Minister Prem Kumar has ordered an inquiry into the relationship between lychee and encephalitis in Muzaffarpur
 kya aap ye maanate hai ki sarkaar or doctor inseflitis se hone vaali mauton kaa sahi kaaran nahin khoj paa rahe hai, isliye maamle ko lichi se jod rahe hai?hamen peediton ke khaane kii aadaten, poshan ke str, vaataavaraniya sthiti or saaf-safai par vistrut adhyayan karnaa hoga
 Malnutrition can be a major cause
 kyonki isaki vajah se bacchon kii pratirohak kshamta kamjor ho jaati he
 Now we should start looking for the cause of the disease
 ham sarkaar kii puri madad karne ko taiyaar hai
 But we want the government to focus on reasons other than litchi
 kashmir ghati main is saal vaise to patharbaji kii ghatnaayen bahut kam hui hai, par siarpief ke jawan aane vaale samay main patharbaajon ko rokane ke liye eke-47 main istemaal hone vaali non leethal plastic kii goliyon kaa istemaal karenge
 The CRPF first had to carry non-lethal weapons separately, but now only with AK 47, so that the terrorists are targeted, plastic bullets will be used to chase away the mob and the stone-pelters
 aapako bataa den ki eke-47 kaa naam sunate hi har ek shaks ke man main dar baith jaataa he, kyoki force usko aparaadhiyon ke khatme ke liye or apradhi isko janata main apana dar failaane ke liye istemaal karte hai
 But now this AK-47 will be used for some other purpose
 ajtak se eksclusive baatcheet main siarpief ke diji aaraar bhatnagar ne bataaya, 'les leethal hathiyaar yuz karne par shodh kiya gaya or uske liye vibhinn alternetive hamaare paas aae hai
 It also has an alternative plastic bullet
 jo hamaare regular hathiyaar yani AK 47 se fire ho saktaa he
 Previously, the Les Lethal bullet that we used to carry with the normal arms did not fire, but now it can be used in the arms that are with us
 yah les leethal goliyaan hai or na goliyon kaa istemaal patharbaji ke dauraan kiya ja saktaa he
 It has been created by research by DRDO and the concept behind using such a bullet is that if the jawan has to handle law and order situations then he can use the Les Lethal bullet with this weapon
 is tareeke kii 21000 goliyaan jammu-kashmir main bheji gai hai, jo patharbaji or croud control ko niyantran karne main prayog kiya jayega
 'let me tell you that as soon as the plastic bullets will come out of the AK-47 gun, they will be broken into many pieces and the same pieces will be placed in the body parts of the miscreants and stone-pelting, which will not threaten his life, but he will have to stop
 kashmir bheji gayi 21,000 golionphilhal aisi plastic kii 21000 goliyaan kashmir bheji gai hai
 In riot control work, security forces started developing it in the last three years, which has been completed this year and for the first time the AK-47 in Jammu and Kashmir will use plastic bullets
 is goli ko desh ke pratishthit santhaan diardio kii madad se viksit kiya gaya he or abghati main pallate ganke alaava ye plastic kii goliyaan bhi istemaal kii ja sakengi
 In view of its success in riot control, riot control will be used in the same manner in other parts of the country

 aaj tak ke kaarykram 'sidhi baat' ke dauraan unhone ye baaten kahin
 On the discussion about his new film Chall Chalen, he said that the film is based on the children and their emotions
 is film kaa kathy yahi he ki bacchon par padhai main behatar pradarshan karne kaa dabaab banaaya janaa galat he
 After an age they should be given the right to take decisions on their own
 unhone kaha ki is vishay par aaj bhi gambhir filmein banane kii kisi ne koshish nahin kii
 There is no talk of parental disrespect when asked if they are inciting children against parents, they said no
 unhone kaha ki ve bacchon ke haq kii baat karte hai, maa-baap ke anadar kii baat nahin karte hai
 Love the children, give importance to his will
 saath hi unhone yah bhi joda ki bengal ke log haq kii ladaai ladate hai

 bacchon se hameshaa first aane kii ummid nahin kerani chahie
 Today the pressure of home and society is very high on children
 unhone sweekaar kiya ki yah samaaj sudhaar karne vaali film he
 No one is like Amitabh
 In response to the question of why he suddenly disappeared in the 90s after several hit films, he said that one cannot remain in the number one chair all the time
 amitabh bachchan se apni tulana kiye jane par unhone kaha ki ve (amitabh) har daur ke behtareen actor hai, yahi sachai he
 However, no one can take the place of anyone
 koi aisa actor nahin he, jisaki koi film flop na hui ho
 Strict refrain from factionalism
 On being reminded of the early days, he said that he has become an actor after recovering from the era of poverty
 chunki har vakt abhinay se hi kaam nahin chalaaya ja saktaa tha, isliye unhone baad main hotel vyavsaay or skool ke kshetra main kadam rakhaa
 On the discussion of factionalism in Bollywood, Mithun Da said that he has always been against factionalism and condemning others

 We demand from Sonia that instead of shedding crocodile tears, she should explain why her first job in the National Advisory Council was to increase the prices of petrol
 ’kumaar ne bataaya ki ek july ko bhaajapa adhyaksh nitin gadakari ratlam main, vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj raipur main, em venkaiya naidu chennai main, rajnath singh bhubaneshwar or murali manohar joshi ranchi main manhagaai virdohi andolan kii aguwai karenge
 Before the monsoon session of Parliament that starts in July, the party has also made an ambitious plan to get 10 crore signatures against inflation
 kumaar ne bataaya ki paanch karod hastakshar pehle hi karaae ja chuke hai

 Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafin has indicated that the rebels are ready to leave power and the country if the interim council of rebels assures them to give money and not to pursue criminal cases against them

 satta chhodane ke liye unki shart baari maatra main nakadi or aapraadhit mukademon se mukti kaa aashwaasan ho sakati he
 On the other hand, the interim council of insurgents based in Benghazi has rejected Kajafi's offer of a respectful farewell, saying that doing so would be an insult to the victims of this dictator's atrocities
 khabaron main kaha gaya he ki gaddaphi ne purv pradhanmantri jadallah ajoj talhi ko vridohiyon se mulaakaat karne ke jie bheja he taaki samjhaute ke kisi masaude par sahmati ban sake
 According to the proposal, Gaddafi will hand over the reins of power to the 'general People's Congress' of Libya
 antarim parishad se jude ek sutara ne bataaya, ‘yah sunne ko mila he ki duusare paksh ne prastaav diya he ki gaddaphi baari-bharkam rakam kii evaj main satta sansad ke pramukh ko saunp denge or desh bhi chhodkar chale jaaenge
 From the council's perspective, the demand for money can prove to be a major obstacle
 ’vidrohiyon ke ek adhikari ahamed jabaril ne bataaya, ‘talhi se meri nikatataa he
 And he enjoys considerable respect throughout Libya
 hamane saaf kar diya he ki koi baatcheet is buniyaad par honi chahie ki gaddaphi satta chodenge

 police ko pataa chalaa he ki faraari ke dauraan bhi usne kai ladakiyon ke saath rape kiya tha
 Actually, he tells girls vitamins

 Currently trials are going on in several cases against the drugs mafia Joaquin Gazman El Chapo

 Investigating officers are also surprised to know about his black acts
 haal hi main khulaasa hua he ki jab jokin gajaman police or suraksha agenciyon se bhaagta phir rahaa tha us dauraan bhi usne kai ladakiyon ko apni havas kaa shikaar banaaya tha
 He used to tell those girls 'vitamins' for themselves
 uske mutabik rape karne se uski jindagi or swasth behatar hota tha
 In court, a witness named Alex Syfuentis told that a woman named Comrade Maria used to talk to Joaquin Gazeman constantly
 wo el chapo ko jawan ladakiyon kii tasviren bhejti thi
 El Chapo used to pick the girls from among them and call them at their intelligence base on the hills
 wo is kaam ke liye lakhon rupee chukaata tha

 The Bharatiya Janata Party has gained an edge in the state, but it could not reach Mission 44

 The party is getting all the seats from this Hindu-dominated area
 yani dhruvikaran hua he
 However, the BJP also fielded a large number of Muslim candidates

 The party also gave tickets to 4 Kashmiri Pandits and 1 Sikh candidate from Kashmir Valley
 ladakh main 3 buddha ummidavaaron par bhi daav khelaa gaya
 But the entire emphasis of BJP was on Jammu

 However, BJP got Muslim votes in the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin vidhansabha chunaav main musalamaanon ne bijepi se duuri bana lee

 Opponents are saying that the bjp's Kashmir mission could not be completed due to non-availability of Muslim votes
 isaki badi vajah wo saare vivaadit bayaan bhi rahe hai, jo modi ke mantriyon or bijepi ke netaaon ne vakt-bevakt diye
 Experts say that even though Modi himself has kept away from such statements, the people of his party have left no stone unturned in making frenzied statements
 sadhvi niranjan jyoti ho yaa phir sakshi maharaj yaa phir giriraaj singh, sabhi ek se badhkar ek bayaanbaji karte rahe
 Whatever is said, if the BJP has suffered from these statements in the valley, then it has also gained in Jammu
 ab bijepi rajya main duusari sabase badi party banakar ubhar rahi he lekin sarkaar banane main uskaa yogadan kitna hoga? ye kahana abhi jaldbaaji hogi

 a post shared by Vikas Khanna (@vikaskhannagroup) on Nov 23, 2017 at 12:18am PST Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis answered every question from the platform of Aaj Tak's 'mumbai Manthan'
 jab unase unki patni ke bare main nijee sawaal puche gaye to unhone badi bebaaki se iskaa bhi jawaab diya
 In 'mumbai Manthan', Fadnavis was asked that you are more active on social media, but videos of your wife are becoming viral more than you
 is par fadanvis ne jawaab diya ki meri patni kya mere se bandhi hui he? vah ek swantatra vyaktitv hai
 She works according to her thinking
 kuch choti soch ke log unhentrolkarte hai
 If they have to stay on the field, the trolling people will have to answer
 aage bolte hue fadanvis ne kaha unka swatantra vyaktitv he, unki apni alag vichaardhaara he
 If he has to stay in the field, then such people will have to answer
 meri apni alag vichaardhaara he
 On this again, the question was put on them that are there any differences between the two of you? Fadnavis jokingly said, "no, we live together
" raat main waapas vahiin janaa hai or khaanaa bhi vahiin khaanaa he
 Let me tell you that a video of Devendra Fadnavis' wife Amrita Fadnavis is going viral on social media
 isamen aisa lag rahaa he ki amrutha suraksha vyavstha ke khilaaf jaakar krooj ke deck par selfi le rahi hai
 Fadnavis has clarified that the lower deck was below the upper deck of the cruise
 vahaan baithne se pehle amrutha ne captain se poocha tha ki vah vahaan baith sakati hai, to captain ne haa kahi thi
 So Amrita was sitting there but the video is made from this angle as if there is a danger of falling down into the sea

 He said that you are sick
 aap logon ke dimag main ye beemaari kii tarah baith gai he
 You need to see a psychiatrist
 rasta ek hi ki aap apane dil se nikaal lijie ki ham hindustani nahin hai
 Farooq said that the reason for this question is doubtful and there is no cure for it
 wo bole ki is duniya main bade neem-hakim aae par shaq ki goli kis ke paas nahin ai
 Why this question is asked from Kashmiri, why the question of being Indian is not asked to any other Indian
 aap kisi or se, jo kashmir se nahin hai, ye sawaal kabhi kyon nahin poochhate or yah sawaal keval kashmiriyon se hi kyon poocha jaataa he
 He says that the day this doubt will come out of the hearts of people, the conditions will start to recover
 unhone kaha ki kashmiriyon ne desh ke liye kitni hi qurbaaniyaan di hai
 But it is a matter of regret that we are not able to recover from the habit of fighting and doubting

 bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kaha ki bijepi ne ek nae avatar ko dobaaraa janm diya he jo apane bujurgon kaa apmaan kar rahi he
 While campaigning in favor of JDU candidate and builder Anil Sharma from Jehanabad Lok Sabha seat, Nitish said that the BJP was over whose leader was Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 ab bijepi kaa nayaa avatar hua he or aisa nayaa avatar hua he jisamen bijepi ke sabhi bade netaaon ko darkinar kar die gaye
 Nitish's reference was to senior BJP leaders LK Advani, Murali Manohar Joshi, Jaswant Singh, Lalmuni Choubey and Chandramohan Roy
 unhone kaha, ‘adwani ji ladanaa chaahate the par kaha gaya ki gandhinagar ke pinjade main kaid raho
 Nitish said that in the eighties, the slogan used to be that the bjp's three heritage Atal, Advani and Murali Manohar
 ye tisare dharohar joshi ko varanasi chhodkar janaa padaa
 'BJP is bypassing the elderly' Nitish said that in 1999, Jaswant Singh, who was the Minister of External Affairs, Defense and Finance in the Atal government, along with George Fernandes, who prepared the minimum common program of the NDA, did not get a ticket from his home constituency in Rajasthan
 Given
 unhone kaha ki bihar main lalamuni choube kaa baxur se tikat kaat diya or puraane netaa chandramohan raay ke bare main akhbaar main aayaa he ki unhone bhi bijepi ke sabhi padon se istipha de diya he
 Nitish Kumar said that the way the new avatar of that party captured the BJP, he wants to capture the country with the help of the capitalists
 unhone modi kii chunavi reliyon kii charchaa karte hue kaha ki chunaav par kitna kharch kiya ja rahaa he
 Crores of rupees are being spent on each rally
 vah paisa kahaan se aa rahaa he
 Whose money is it? nitish ne kaha ki jo puunjipati paisa laga rahaa he vah nivesh kar rahaa he or desh kii raajnneeti main nivesh kar rahaa he
 He alleged that the capitalists who were till now used to help but now want to rule the country by putting a mask (narendra Modi) in front
 isliye ve dhan laga rahe hai
 Uncountable wealth is being used
 chunaav ke dauraan itane bade paimaane par ek party jo kharch kar rahi he
 We have not spent so much on elections from any party since we have sensed
 unka ishaara bijepi kii taraf tha
 'am not arrogant but self-respecting' Nitish said that the money he is giving will recover it after the election
 isliye yuva peedi ko aagaah karnaa chaahate hai ki ve (modi) vikaas kaa dhakosle kii baat main naa aaye
 He said that the way the BJP is glorifying the development model of Gujarat, the employment opportunities were reduced even after large capital investment there
 nitish ne kaha ki ve bhaavana bhadakaakar satta paane or sampradayikta kii raajnneeti bardaasht nahin kar sakate
 So regardless of his principle, the chair was severed from him
 unhone kaha ki aaj bihar ke vikaas kii baat karne par bijepi dwaara apamaanit kiya ja rahaa he or unhen ahamkaari kaha ja rahaa he
 We cannot be egoistic, are proud
 hamen hindustani or bihari hone kaa swabhimaan he
 What is the meaning of development if not employment? Nitish Kumar said that he is fighting for the status of special state status to Bihar but some people are fighting for the chair (to become PM of Narendra Modi) and talking about Gujarat's model of development Have been
 unhone kaha ki gujarat main adivaasiyon kii dasha kya sudhari or unhen rojgaar mila
 Statistics show that earlier 80 percent of the tribals in Gujarat were dependent on the farm, and now that there is so much industry there, now that they have got work in factories, instead of reducing their dependence on farming, it has now increased to 85 percent
 nitish ne kaha ki gujarat main puunji lag rahi he par vahaan rojgaar ke avasar nahin paidaa ho rahe hai aise main us vikaas kaa kya matlab he
 He said that according to 2007 figures, two lakh laborers worked in cotton farming in Gujarat and one third of them are child laborers
 laalaten par muhar lagaaya to kaise milegi bijli?nitish ne kaha ki argedy supremeo lalu prasad par prahaar karte hue kaha ki ve din main hi laalaten jalaakar gum rahe hai
 Remember that the day the lantern will start burning in the day (voted in favor of RJD) neither electricity will reach nor will there be peace in the society
 unhone algepi supremeo ramvilas paswan or rajd supremeo lalu prasad par kataaksh karte hue kaha ki unhen kisi prakaar kaa lobh nahin he or na hi apane bhai yaa parivaar ke kisi anya ko aage badhanaa he balki bihar ke das karod logon kii chintaa he
 Some worry about the son, some worry about the daughter and some worry for Bibi and brother-in-law (sadhu Yadav) even if it does not work
 nitish ne naksal prabhavit jahanabad or usase alag hue araval jila kii charchaa karte hue kaha ki unki sarkaar ke satta main aane ke purv aam janata kii baat to dur kuch ilaakon main din main police bhi jane se kataraati thi or shaam hone se pehle log ghar laut aate the, par ab ve apni marji se lautate hai
 On the visit of Bharatiya Janata Party national president Amit Shah to Chandigarh, the Congress has said that Amit Shah is not coming to Chandigarh himself, but is being sent to him
 punjab congress adhyaksh sunil jakhad ne kaha ki chaar saal tak bijepi ne akaliyon kii khoj khabar nahin lee
 During this time, BJP leaders also did not think it was right to join hands with Akali Dal founder Prakash Singh Badal
 ab jab amit shah chandigarh aa rahe hai to bhed khul gaya
 Prakash Singh Badal also understands that Amit is not coming from Shahkhud but is being sent to him
 sunil jakhad ne kaha ki bijepi or uske sahyogiyon ko rahul gandhi kii leadership kaa bhay kha rahaa he
 The way Rahul Gandhi is getting people's support, whether it is Karnataka or elsewhere, it has created a feeling of insecurity within the BJP
 sunil jaakhadane kaha ki mujhe yaad nahin he ki pichley 4 saalon ke dauraan narendra modi or prakaash singh badal kii koi mulaakaat hui ho
 When there was talk of putting GST on the anchor of Harmandir Sahib, people hoped that Prakash Singh Badal would meet Narendra Modi and get him out of GST list immediately
 aisa lagata he ki yaa to pradhanmantri ne akali dal netaaon ko milane kaa samay nahin diya yaa phir unki unase is mudde par baat karne kii himmat nahin hui
 He said that the BJP would never have taken care of the Akali Dal if Rahul Gandhi had not got the support of the people
 unhone kaha ki kisaan pichley hafte se sadakon par he lekin prakaash singh badal ke munh se unke liye ek bhi shabd nahin niklaa
 He said, 'I would like to remind Prakash Singh Badal that the way diesel prices have broken the back of farmers and they are forced to drop their produce on the roads
 unako chahie ki amit shah ke samaksh in muddon ko uthaaen taaki til-til kar mar rahe kisaan batch saken
 'significantly, for the last few years , there has been a figure of 36 between the BJP and its ally Shiromani Akali Dal in Punjab on many issues
 chaahe vah alpsankhyak ayog ke adhyaksh kii niyukti ho yaa phir sadasyon kii niyuktiyaan ho
 Apart from this, the Shiromani Akali Dal also had to work hard to get the Harmandir Sahib's anchor out of GST
 kendriya mantri harsimrat cor ne jab apana pad chhodane kii dhamkee di to uske baad centre sarkaar jaagi or swarna mandir kii rasoi ko jiesti se baahar kiya
 Not only this, Akali Dal President Sukhbir Singh Badal has clearly said a few days ago that the meetings that should have been held between the NDA and allies during the last four years could not be done, which they are proud of
 amit shah prakaash singh badal ke saath milakar naa keval is raajnneetik khatas ko dur karnaa chaahate hai balki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon kii ranneeti taiyaar karnaa chaahate hai
 When other members in the Lok Sabha were listening to the discussion on important issues like inflation, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi was found sleeping
 sidhe-sidhe janata se jude masale ke dauraan rahul gandhi kaa sote paaya janaa kisi ko bhi chaunkaane or neend se jagaane ke liye kaaphi he
 On the one hand, the Congress leader in the Lok Sabha is ready to go to the court to get the chair of the opposition, on the other hand, his 'yuvraj' seems to be very insensitive on issues like inflation
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad 44 siton tak simat chuki congress aise ravaie ke saath kis tarah vipaksh ke dharm kaa nirvaah karegi, yah ek bada sawaal he
 This shot from Lok Sabha TV was shared by people on social media, watched it with great interest and also made snappy comments on it
 ek taraf congress ne is aarope ko khaarij kiya ki rahul so rahe the, vahiin bhaajapa ne yah kehete hue kataaksh kiya ki congress mahangaai ke mudde par pichley 10 saal se aisa hi karti aa rahi he
 Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said, 'this is not true
 main is aarope ko sire se nakaarta hum
 Singhvi said that the case has been presented sensationally
 unhone aashcharya jataate hue yah bhi kaha ki kya aise mudde uthaanaa shobhaa detaa he
 Singhvi said that for the last seven weeks, the government has done 'cheap and revenge politics'
 kamaal he rahul ji
 
 
 Well, when that picture of Rahul Gandhi came, he was very much shared on social media
 caments kii bauchhaar ho gai
 BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said, 'the Congress was sleeping for the last 10 years on the issue of inflation
 or aaj jab sansad main mahangaai par charchaa ho rahi thi to congress ke yuvaraj hi so gaye
 "he said," Congress is not ready to discuss inflation and price hike
 unhone is shabd ko sirf narebaaji ke liye istemaal kiya
 The Congress was never serious on the issue of price rise and so Rahul Gandhi became so bored that he fell asleep
 ’rahul Gandhi was seen sleeping in Parliament during a debate on price rise
 That's what the Congress was doing during their 10 yr rule
 — Shahnawaz Hussain (@shahnawazbjp)july 9, 2014it's not his fault

 In the last 14 years of my parliamentary career, i have seen many of the people of Shahnawaz Hussain's own party BJP sleeping and napping in Parliament
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘kabhi-kabhi log apni ankhen band kar lete hai or bahut dhairya se bhaashan sunate hai
 The same must have happened to Rahul Gandhi
 atal bihari vaajapeyi vaad-vivaad ke dauraan apni ankhen band kar lete the
 what does this mean?' The Congress leader said, 'many ministers of the BJP still sleep or nap what they call' catnap '
 ho saktaa he rahul gandhi dhairya se sun rahe hon
 You are exaggerating it in a non-essential way

 film main aalia ke pati kaa role masaan fame vicky kaushal ne kiya he
 Before this, Raji's passion was reflected in Raji's song
 gane ke bol film kii kahani kaa plat behatar tareeke se samajhaate hai
 Arijit Singh has sung it with aplomb
 aap kisi se milti hai
 He talks sweetly to you, praises you a little bit and you feel that he is a good person
 lekin aapaki ye soch sau fisadi sahi ho, aisa hone kii sambhaavna bahut kam hoti he
 Usually girls quickly trust someone and cheat
 lekin thodi si samajhadaari dikhaakar aap dhokhaa khaane se batch sakati hai
 These are the 5 things that you can keep in mind to avoid deceitful men
 1
 The Mystery Manho You may like to be mysterious, but this habit creates doubt
 aise log zyaadaatar apane mobile main hi lage rahete hai lekin aap jab bhi unka inbox dekhengi wo khaali hi najar aayega
 People who have a tendency to cheat keep their everything hidden or secret
 na to unke jane kaa pataa hota he or na hi aane kaa
 2
 bahut zyada mithi baaten karne vaale marowgar wo bahut adhik flert karata he to aapako saavdhaan ho jane kii jarurat he
 People who talk excessively sweet also keep many other things in their mind
 kya wo aapse mithi baaten to karata he lekin jab aap usase future kii baaten karti hai to kya wo raffuchakkar ho jaataa he
 If his behavior is like this then it would be better that you be careful
 3
 Is he careless about the things related to you? Is he very careless about the things related to you? Does he forget every important date and then make excuses in reverse? It can be dangerous to trust such people
 4
 Does he try to control you? Do you feel suffocated while staying with him? Do you mind him being overly positive and protective? If you think that he is trying to control you, then it is better that you separate from him
 5
 Does he keep your identity secret? Does he hide your identity? If he keeps his relationship with you hidden from people, then it is better that you separate from him
 ek taraf teen rajyon main navarnivaachit sarkaron dwaara kisaanon kii karjamaafee ke elaan ko lekar congress party apni peeth thapthapa rahi he, to vahiin bhartiya janata party (bijepi) punjab or karnataka main congress nit sarkaron dwaara kii gai karjamaafee ko lekar sawaal khadey kar rahi he
 The BJP has accused the Congress of retreating from the farmers' debt waiver and said that now the farmers of both the states have started getting notices
 kendriya mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne aarope lagaaya ki congress ke liye vaada karnaa or phir usase mukar janaa nai baat nahin rah gai he
 In Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the Congress promised but did not fulfill it
 karnataka main vahaan kii sarkaar ne 45 hajaar karod kii karjamaafee kii baat kii thi, lekin wo bhi khokhli sabit hui
 He said that 397 farmers committed suicide in Karnataka in the last 6 months
 ye congress kaa trek record he
 Prakash Javadekar said that the debt of farmers of Punjab and Karnataka has not been forgiven, but in contrast farmers have been given notices on behalf of banks, cases are being filed against them
 unhone kaha ki punjab main bhi 90 hajaar karod kii karjamaafee kii baat kii gai thi, lekin vahaan bhi kisaanon ke saath dhokhaa kiya gaya
 Javadekar alleged that due to the anti-farmer policy of the Congress for 50 years, the plight of the farmers has taken place
 kisaanon ko unki fasal kaa sahi mulya nahin diya gaya
 The Swaminathan Commission recommendations were implemented by the Modi government, whereas the Congress never did anything in this matter
 paanch rajyon main kisaanon ko dhokhaa dekar vaade kiye gaye
 What happened in Karnataka and Punjab is going to happen in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh too

 jahaan uskaa medical karaayaa gaya
 Medical treatment confirmed
 iske baad police ne fouran dabish dekar javed or faiyaaz ko giraftaar kar liya
 Both were produced in court, from where they were sent to jail
 police kaa kahana he ki police is maamle main jald se jald chargeshit daakhil kar degi

 yojana ayog naksal prabhavit 34 jilon main sadak, bijli or peya jal jaise buniyadi dhaanche ke vikaas ke liye 3,400 karod rupee kii yojana ko jald antim rup de saktaa he
 Following the instruction of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, an integrated action plan is being prepared for Naxal-affected districts
 ek ucch padasth sutara ne bataaya ki yojana ko agle saptaah antim rup diya ja saktaa he
 Up to Rs 100 crore can be allocated for each of these districts under this scheme
 yojana ayog ke akalan ke mutabik desh ke pichde kshetron main bharat nirmaan jaisi sarkaar kii pramukh yojana kaa vaanchit parinaam nahin aayaa he
 This has increased the problem of Naxalism in many parts of the country
 yojana ayog ke upaadhyaksh montek singh ahaluwalia ne kaha, ‘yah pehali baar ho rahaa he
 We are looking at the entire development strategy for the Naxalite affected areas

 hycourt ke aadesh par police mahanideshak (dijipi) devraj nagar ne pradesh bhar main yah vyavastha lagu karne ke nirdesh die hai
 It is often revealed that girls leave parents and relatives for love
 lekin premi se shaadi ke baad dhokhaa milane par unka bhavishya chunauti ban jaataa he
 This is an exercise to save them from this darkness and uncertainty
 sant kabeernagar ke mahuli nivasee rekha kii yachika par elahabaad hycourt ke aadesh par pradesh main yah nai vyavastha shuru kii ja rahi he
 Now love marriages will have to guarantee the future of their love
 dijipi ne 13 disambar ko police adhikshakon ko patr likhakar is niyam ko lagu karne ko kaha he
 Hardoi's Superintendent of Police Govind Agarwal said that a kidnapping case is filed if a lover takes away a girlfriend for marriage without the consent of the family
 lekin ladki ke balig hone or apni marji se premi ke saath jane par maamla rafa-dfa ho jaataa he
 But now to end such a case, the lover will have to deposit a fixed fee of Rs 50,000 for his girlfriend for three years
 sab kuch sahi rahaa to yah dhanrashi waapas mil jaaegi
 But if the lover turns out to be a fraud and tries to exploit, harass or harass the girlfriend of Jeevan Sangini, then 50 thousand rupees will be taken, legal action will also be taken against him
 karnataka ke raajnneetik naatak par buudhvaar ko pardaa gir jane ke saath sabaki nazren 28 may ko upi main do siton par hone vaale upachunaav kii ore mud jaaengi
 Polling will be held on May 28 for the Kairana Lok Sabha seat and the Noorpur assembly seat in UP
 in upachunaavon ko ‘bijepi banaam vipakshi ekajutata’ ke chunavi sangram ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 It is also being said that the results of these by-elections will give a lot of clues about what kind of battle will be played for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 mangalvaar ko vipakshi ekajutata ko or dhar dene ke liye aam aadmi party (aap) ne bhi kairana or nurpur main vipakshi ummidavaaron ko samarthan dene kaa elaan kiya
 Let me tell you that the opposition has fielded Tabsum Hasan as their common candidate in comparison to BJP candidate Mriganka Singh in Kairana
 rashtriya lok dal ke chunaav chihn ke saath chunaav lard raheen tabbasum hasan kosmajawaadee party, bahujan samaaj party or congress kaa bhi samarthan hasil he
 BJP candidate for Noorpur Assembly seat Avani Singh is up against Samajwadi Party candidate naeem-ul-hasan
 raajnneetik jaankaron kaa kahana he ki upi main aam aadmi party kaa bahut simit aadhaar he
 In such a situation, the support of opposition candidates of this party may not have any significant impact on the result, but it will definitely give strength to the opposition solidarity campaign for the 2019 general election
 bataa den ki upi main kuch maheene pehle gorakhpur or phulpur loksabhaa siton ke liye hue upachunaav main samaajawaadee party ke ummidavaaron ko bispi ne samarthan diya tha
 The SP (SP) candidates had won both places
 ye dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki aam aadmi party ke samarthak kaise congress, espi, bispi, ajit singh ke rashtriya lok dal ke saath kandhe se kandhaa milaayenge
 All these parties were declared corrupt by Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal while starting his political journey
 is bich, arvind kejariwal buudhvaar cobangalooru main kumaraswamike shapath grahan samaaroh main vipakshi netaaon ke saath manch saajha karte najar aaenge
 Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati, Ajit Singh, Chandrababu Naidu, KCR, Pinarayi Vijayan, Kamal Haasan, Tejashwi Yadav are likely to arrive at the swearing-in ceremony

 Only such people are nervous about their power
 jo sansadhano or samparkon ke network se vanchit he, vah chup he
 He is not speaking for anyone
 aap usase bulawaayenge to aapke hisaab se bolne lagata he
 Both sides of the electoral arena have crushed this uneasiness in Bihar
 unke paas bihar kii is chatapataahat ko samajhane ke liye na to vakt he or na shabd
 Cow, reservation are not all these issues

 Questions are arising in his mind about the way money is being spent in elections

 Find out the candidate of any party, you will know the reason for getting the ticket
 partiyaan garib virdohi hai
 They do not allow any common man from his platform whose father or father does not have the network of resources and contacts

 The city of Bihar is a copy of the aspirations of Delhi Mumbai

 There has been no expansion and improvement of cities in ten years

 Every young man is trapped in the desire to be something

 The Bihari youth considers this to be his citizenship
 uske paas apane samay or samaaj ko lekar koi nai soch nahin he
 In the name of this many thinking, he has accepted to be a supporter of a party
 raajnneeti main yuva kabad kii tarah bikharaa hua he
 His youth is not used to clean the garbage, but to keep it covered
 tippaniyan Hence there is a gap between rich and poor
 donon kii chahat main koi fark nahin he
 The only difference is distance
 badlaav ke naam par samaaj main yathasthiti kii nirantarata bani hui he
 So, stop thinking about this election
 vikaas ek sikaa he jise chalaane ke liye bahut sara paisa kharch kiya ja rahaa he
 Everyone is feeling the news of newspaper and TV being sold
 magar, koi bol nahin rahaa
 This is the condition of our readers and viewers
 vah jaanata he ki akhbaar yaa channel kya ho chuke hai magar phir bhi rose akhbaar karidata he or channel dekhtaa he
 Society is stuck

 There are some people who want to change but later they also have to be part of this invisible network
 bihari matadaata koi tisamaarkhaan nahin he
 He is trapped by his own nutwork
 jiske laabh ke liye vah chup he
 Everybody needs a party
 party pehle se fiks he
 There is a network fixation within the party
 jis tarah se rajya kii satta par kabja hota he usee tarah partiyon ke bheetar bhi kuch logon kaa kabja ho chukaa he
 Therefore, the so-called people feel cheated after every election but there is another truth

 aspx Hearing the child marriage case, the Supreme Court on Tuesday said that despite the law that child marriage is considered a crime, people do child marriage
 court ne tippanee karte hue ki ye marriage nahin miraj he
 The Supreme Court, while hearing the case of child marriage, said that we have three options, first remove this exception which means that in the case of child marriage, if her husband forms a relationship with a girl of 15 to 18 years, It is considered a rape
 court ne kaha- doosraa vikalp ye he ki is maamle main posco act lagu kiya jaae yani bal vivaah ke maamle main 15 se 18 saal kii ladki ke saath agar uskaa pati sambandh banaata he to us par posco ke tahat karrwai ho
 At the same time, the third option is that nothing should be done in this and it should be considered an exception, which means that in the case of child marriage, if a husband with a girl of 15 to 18 years has a relationship then she will not be considered a rape
 yachikakarta kii taraf se kaha gaya ki bal vivaah se bacchon ke adhikaron kaa ulanghan ho rahaa he
 The petition said that child marriage is a kind of crime against children because they get more sexual harassment than getting married at a young age, so there is a need to protect children
 tippaniyan In fact, the court is hearing the petition of the organization, which said that women marrying between 15 and 18 years have no protection
 yachikakarta kii ore se kaha gaya he ki ek tarah ladakiyon kii shaadi kii nunatam aayu 18 varsh he, lekin isse kam umr kii ladakiyon kii shaadi ho rahi he
 The petition states that the marriage of girls aged 15 to 18 is not illegal, but it can be declared illegal
 yachika main yah bhi daleel di gai he ki itani kam main umr main ladakiyon kii shaadi se uske swasthya par bura asar padataa he
 The court said that the second option is to implement the POSCO Act in this case, that in case of child marriage, if a husband makes a relation with a girl of 15 to 18 years, then she should be taken under POSCO
 vahiin teesraa vikalp ye he ki isamen kuch na kiya jaae or ise apwaad mana jaae, jiskaa matlab ye he ki bal vivaah ke maamle main 15 se 18 saal kii ladki ke saath agar uskaa pati sambandh banaae to wo rape nahin mana jayega
 It was said on behalf of the petitioner that child marriage is violating the rights of children
 yachika main kaha gaya ki bal vivaah bacchon par ek tarah kaa jurm he kyonki kam umr main shaadi karne se unka yon utpeedan zyada hota he, aise main bacchon ko protect karne kii jarurat he
 The comments darasal, adaalat us sanghathan kii yachika par sunwaayee kar rahi he, jisamen kaha gaya ki 15 se 18 varsh ke bich shaadi karne vaali mahilaon ko kisi tarah kaa sangrakshan nahin he
 On behalf of the petitioner it has been said that the minimum age of marriage of girls is 18 years, but girls below this age are getting married
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki 15 se 18 varsh kii ladakiyon kii shaadi avaidh nahin hoti he, lekin ise avaidh ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he
 The petition also argues that the marriage of girls at such a young age affects their health

 Madhya Pradesh Congress has accused the BJP government of the state that it is charging maximum tax on cooking gas and diesel in the country, but is not ready to give relief to the public

 koyala ghotaalaa maamle main sibiai diarector ranjit sinha ke khilaaf aam aadmi party netaa or peshey se vakil prashanth bhushan kii arji par shuukravaar ko kaaphi tikhi bahes dekhne ko mili
 Bhushan has given an affidavit against Sinha alleging that Ranjit Sinha has met Muain Qureshi, a hawala businessman and under income tax scrutiny, at his government residence 90 times in 15 months
 bhushan, ranjit sinha par koyala ghotaale or 2ji ghotaalaa ke aropiyon se apane sarkari awaas par milane kaa aarope pehle hi laga chuke hai
 Bhushan alleged that Muin Qureshi may be acting as a link between the accused in the coal scam and the CBI director
 bhushan ke in aaropon par ranjit sinha ke vakil vikaas singh ne sakht etraj jataayaa
 When the debate intensified several times, the bench of Chief Justice RM Lodha asked both the parties to exercise restraint
 court ne kaha, 'agar desh kii pehali court main ye ho rahaa he to desh kii baaki court main kya maahaul hota hoga
 Ranjit Sinha's lawyer Vikas Singh did not agree to the court's pleas several times, so the court also hit him hard
 court ne kaha, 'aap sari hadein par chuke hai
 You cannot abduct a court proceeding like this
 hamaari chhot kaa aap is tarah galat faaydaa naa uthaayen
 Prashant Bhushan once again demanded that Sinha be removed from the coal scam probe and the SIT should be formed to investigate the allegations against him, but the court refused to do so at present
 ranjit sinha ke vakil vikaas singh ne adaalat se kaha ki prashanth bhushan ko supreme court ke nyaayadhish par bhi bharosa nahin he
 He refused to disclose to the bench the name of the source who provided him the visitor register, despite instructions from the bench of Justice HL Dattu, hearing the 2G case
 vikaas singh ne kaha ki bhushan sirf khabaron main bane rahane ke liye ye sab kar rahe hai
 By doing all this at the behest of someone else, they are tarnishing the image of CBI and CBI Director
 sunwaayee ke dauraan sibiai ne adaalat main kaha ki jo vizitor register bhushan ne adaalat main die hai unki koi pramanikta nahin he or wo farji bhi ho sakate hai
 On this, Bhushan asked the court to take this statement of lawyer Amarendra Sharan appearing on behalf of CBI
