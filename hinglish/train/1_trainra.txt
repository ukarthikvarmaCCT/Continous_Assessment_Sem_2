 There is news of a blast in Lucknow's CJM Court
 court ke bathroom main ek sutali bam fata he
 No one was injured in the blast
 haseen sapanom ke saath hawa main udne vaali haniprit ek baar salaakhon ke peeche kya pahunchi uske har sapane tut kar bikhar rahe hai
 Now his dream is not safe
 bache hai to sirf uske gunaah, jinka hisaab-kitaab chal rahaa he
 His dream of getting bail also broke down yesterday
 ab wo 6 november tak nyaayik hiraasat main hi rahegi
 Honeypreet, of course, considered himself innocent, but the police have not one but a single strong evidence against him
 unheen sabooton ke dam par police ne ek baar phir haniprit kii ummiido ko jhatka diya he
 When Honeypreet's case was heard on Monday, it was expected that she would get bail
 use salaakhon se azaadi mil jaaegi, lekin ye nahin ho sakaa
 Honeypreet appeared in Panchkula court on Monday through video conferencing
 lekin panchakula court ke vakil hadtaal par the
 Hence no Vakali was presented by Honeypreet
 bahes naa ho paane kii vajah se court ne haniprit maamle kii sunwaayee kii agali taarikh 6 november kar di
 That is, now Honeypreet will remain in Ambala Central Jail
 itnaa hi nahin 6 november ko bhi haniprit ko jamaanat milane kii ummid kam hi he, kyonki uski nyaayik hiraasat ke dauraan hi police ko kai ahm saboot haniprit ke khilaaf mili hai
 Among them is Honeypreet's mobile and laptop
 ab police ke haath haniprit kaa sabase bada raazdaar vardi vaala jasoos head consteble lalchand lag chukaa he
 Lalchand Honeypreet, the head constable posted in the Intelligence Wing of Chandigarh Police, was the detective who wore the uniform of the police, but played the duty of Honeypreet
 pichley somvaar ko esaiti ke hathe is jasoos ke chadhane ke baad 25 agast ko rohtak se ram rahim kii bhagane kii puri sajeesh saamne aa gai, jise haniprit ne rachaa tha
 In the sit's inquiry, Lalchand has made shocking revelations
 ye baba kaa kattar samarthak bhi bataaya jaataa he
 Perhaps this is why Lalchand used his uniform and status illegally for his teacher
 sadhviyon se rape ke maamle main doshi qaraar die jane ke baad ram rahim ko rohtak kii sunaaria jail pahunchane se pehle hi bhagane kii sajeesh thi
 Honeypreet was the mastermind of the plot
 puraa concept haniprit or uske gang kaa tha
 But Lalchand was busy in making him perform
 police ke baari suraksha ghere se bhagane kii badi jimmedaari is par thi
 To carry out the conspiracy, this disciple of Baba made three plans
 lekin apni har koshish main lalchand naakaam rahaa
 Ferrari's 'plan A' plan was that Baba would be boarded and absconded in the bullet-proof car of the Dera as soon as he left the court after the court's decision on August 25
 deraa kaa wo gang chahta tha ki baba ko bullate pruf gaadi se pehle chandigarh pahunchaaya jaae
 Then, in Himachal Pradesh, it should be taken out of sight, or it can be sent across seven seas
 lekin pehre main tainaat pulisavaalon ne ram rahim ko deraa kii gaadi main baithne kii manjuuri nahin di
 In this way, Honeypreet's plan a failed
 faraari kaa 'plan bi'pehali sajeesh naakaam hui to shaitani dimag vaala lalchand plan bi main jute gaya
 Under this, he advised all the commandos of Ram Rahim to sit in the police car
 police kii vahi gaadi jisamen baba ko baitaakar helleypad bheja ja rahaa tha
 The plan was that all the commandos would sit in the police car and take Ram Rahim away at the gunpoint quickly
 lekin plan bi bhi fail ho gaya, kyonki baba ke commando ko police kii gaadi main baithne kii manjuuri hi nahin mili
 Lalchand made his last attempt at the failure of the 'plan C' 2 plans of Ferrari
 usne khud western cmand tak bullate pruf car main baba kaa peechha karte hue gaya
 So that somehow he can be driven away
 kai baar lalchand baba ko le ja rahi police kii SUV ke bagal tak apni gaadi le gaya
 But this formula also died
 haniprit ke gunahon kaa hisaab to abhi baaki he, lekin jiske saath milakar haniprit ne tamaam gunaah kiye wo gurmeet ram rahim 20 saal ke liye salaakhon ke peeche ja chukaa he
 Ram Rahim, the head of Dera Sacha Sauda, now recalls his sins sitting in the loneliness of the jail
 kal usase milane uskaa parivaar jail pahunchaa, lekin patni nahin ai
 Baba's baby doll and Baba himself now have no choice but to remember such a colorful time
 sitam ye ki jin gunahon ko donon ne milakar kiya, use ab ye donon alag-alag jail main kaat rahe hai
 The accused of treason is sitting sad and angry in the jail of Ambani
 sunaaria jail main uskaa papa ram rahim 20 saal kii sajaa kaat rahaa he
 He said - First hand, i catch, i was seen avoiding the attack on the opposition; Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was on the agenda of Aajenda Aaj Tak 2019 on Monday
 badale- badale se andaaj main najar aae kejariwal ne sadhe siyasatdan kii tarah apni paanch saal kii uplabdhiyaan ginaayin
 He was also seen avoiding attacking the opposition before the assembly elections were announced
 mukhyamantri kejariwal se jab shuruaati chaar saal or baad ke ek saal main unke badale tewaron ko lekar sawaal kiya gaya, to jawaab main unhone kaha ki mere bachche settle hai
 i fight for the people
 dilli ke mukhyamantri ne kaha ki chota sa aadmi hum
 The people of Delhi have entrusted the responsibility
 koi kaam funs jaae to pradhanmantriji or alji ke paas jaakar haath jodta hum
 i hold their feet and when they don't, i struggle
 kejarivalane kaha ki sisitivi kii file sin karaane ke liye alji ke ghar 10 din baith gaya
 He used to hang files for a long time
 dharna dene vaali apni chhavi ke sambandh main puche gaye sawaal par unhone halke andaaj main kaha ki pichley paanch saal main ek hi baar diya
 Kejriwal said that earlier all the files used to go to LG for approval
 isse badi dikkat ho rahi thi
 He said that a year and a half ago, the Supreme Court gave the Chief Minister the authority to take all decisions except Land, Police and Law and Order
 kejariwal ne kaha ki iske baad dilli main kaam kii raftaar badi he
 On the allegations being made by the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, he said that whatever he says, the public is happy with the work of the government
 mukhyamantri kejariwal ne kaha ki bhaajapa jab haryana ke chunaav main jaati he tab jat or gaiyr jat ke naam par vot maangati he, desh ke chunaav main hindu or musalmaan ke naam par raajnneeti karti he, lekin mujhe khushi he ki jab vah dilli main aate hai to unhenkachi colonionki yaad aati he
 He said that in democracy democracy is paramount and the people of Delhi have decided to form the government again
 ham agle paanch saal main kya karnaa he, ab is taraf dhyaan de rahe hai

 Keeping this in mind, the side gate has been opened, due to which the direction remains east while exiting, which is auspicious in terms of Vastu Shastra
 jabaki vidhansabha ke saamne vaale get se dakshin disha baithti he
 'an architect who was part of the team who visited the BJP office two months ago suggested to make changes in terms of Vastushastra
 haalanki party netaa vaastushastra ke hisaab se karyaalay kii vyavasthaaon main badlaav karne kii baat se inkaar karte hai
 Party spokesperson Manoj Kumar Mishra says that due to the traffic in front of the assembly building, it was difficult to get in and out of its front gate, due to which this gate has been closed
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri or bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ke upi main aagaaj se pehle hi party kii pradesh ikai ne arase se kharaab chal rahe sitaron kii chaal durust karne ke liye vaastushastra ke vah saare totake aajamaane shuru kar die hai jo soobe main party kii naiya paar laga sake

 The Supreme Court in its historic judgment on Wednesday tried to settle the dispute between the Lieutenant Governor and the Delhi Government
 court ne donon ke adhikaron ke bich main lakeer khinchi
 However, the dispute still continues
 supreme court ke faisle par vitt mantri arun jetali ne blog main apni raay rakhi
 On the transfer issue of the officials, he wrote that the decision has not gone to the Delhi government
 arun jetali ne kaha ki ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisle se spasht ho gaya he ki dilli sarkaar ke paas police kaa adhikaar nahin he, aise main vah purv main hue aparaadhon ke liye jaanch agency kaa gathan nahin kar sakati
 Jaitley said in a Facebook post that apart from this the notion is 'completely flawed' that the decision regarding administration of Union Territory Cadre Services has gone in favor of Delhi Government
 jetali ne kaha ki kai aise mudde rahe jinpar sidhe tippanee nahin kii gai he, lekin vahaan nihitarth ke madhyam se un maamalon ke sanket jarur hai
 The Union Minister has also written in this context that unless subjects of importance have been raised, they have not been discussed and no clear opinion has been expressed, one cannot say that silence on such issues Means that the vote is in favor of one or the other
 jetali ne kaha ki duusari baat yah he ki ucchtam nyaayalay ne spasht kar diya he ki dilli apni tulana anya rajyon se nahin kar sakati
 In this case, to say that a decision has been given in favor of the Government of Delhi regarding the administration of the Union Territory Cadre Services is completely wrong
 gauratlab he kiucchtam nyaayalyaki paanch nyaayadhishon kii peeth ne buudhvaar ko ekamat se faisla diya tha ki dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja nahin diya ja saktaa, iske alaava peeth ne uparajyapal ke adhikaron par kaha tha ki unke paas swatantra rup se nirnay lene kaa adhikaar nahin he
 The Lieutenant Governor has to work with the help and advice of the elected government
 jetali ne kaha ki yah faisla samvidhan ke peeche sanvaidhanik siddhanth kii vistaar se vyakhya karata he or saath hi samvidhan main jo likhaa hua he uski pushti karata he
 He said that neither the rights of the state government or the central government have been increased by this nor there has been any reduction in the rights of anyone
 yah faisla chuni gai sarkaar ke mahatv ko rekhaankit karata he chunki dilli sangh shasit pradesh he isliye iske adhikaar centre sarkaar ke adheen hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi usually listens carefully to his officers in government meetings, but during a meeting recently he was particularly heard saying his point
 is baithak main videsh mantralay ke adhikari unhen vistaar ke saath bataa rahe the ki america, japan or china ke saath samaan duuri banaakar chalane kii niti kyon behatar hogi
 According to close people, Modi said that such a policy may be good and desired for us but will not last long
 unka kahana tha ki antarvirodh jaldi hi ubharkar saamne aa jaaenge or ek had se aage santulan sadhakar chalanaa mushkil ho jayega
 This was before Modi's visit to Japan last month
 isi yatra se ucchstareey rajanyik mulakaaton kaa silsilaa shuru hua tha
 Though this idea never emerged again in the conversation, but Modi's visit to America made it clear what he wanted
 shor-sharabe, dhooma-dhadaake or garjanaon ke baad jab tafasil se baat kii gai to modi sarkaar ne sanket die ki ve washington ke saath haath milaane ke liye apane hisse kii aadhi duuri tay karne ko taiyaar hai
 Not only this, they are ready to go even further so that they can build a relationship with the US, which the UPA government could not even do despite the historic nuclear treaty
 samajha jaataa he ki modi ne taiyaariyon kii shuruyaat main hi yah saaf kar diya tha ki bharat ko aise ‘‘inkaar’’ karne vaale desh kii tarah nahin dekha ja saktaa jo vaishvik manchon par harek america pahal kaa virodh karata he
 This message became clear even during simple issues such as writing a joint editorial with US President Barack Obama in the Washington Post newspaper
 shuruyaat main yojana yah thi ki saamaanya dastur ke mutabik, pradhanmantri kaa likhaa hua ek lekh pratishthit america akhbaar main chhapavaya jaae
 This article was written and also approved for printing
 tabhi america paksh ne is lekh main kuch baaten jodate hue obama ke saath sanyukt lekh kaa vichaar saamne rakhaa
 People inside say that the Indian Mission and some other officials in the US were in favor of the suggestion, but senior officials of South Block, including some officials of the Prime Minister's Office, were uncomfortable
 unhone ‘‘samaan duuri’’ or ‘‘paschimparast hone kii dharna’’ ke nateezon ko lekar sawaal uthaae
 The matter finally reached Modi's desk
 sutara bataate hai ki unhen sanyukt lekh kii manjuuri dene main ‘‘ek minute se bhi kam’’ samay laga
 Then what was there
 karne ko ab sirf itnaa bachaa tha ki donon pakshon kii baton ko ek sanyukt lekh main sweekaarya dhang se jod diya jaae
 Not to say no
 Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the influential vice-chairman of the UPA government's Planning Commission, suffered a lot of outrage from members of Congress and the Cabinet when he phased out the removal of refrigerants and hydrofluorocarbons (hfcs) under the Montreal Protocol
 An official notice of the G20 was approved for discussion
 unhen kareeb-kareeb vikasshil deshon ko vikaas ke liye jaruri technology se vanchit karne ke pashchimi agenda ke aage ghutane techne kaa doshi tehraaya gaya tha
 His critics then dragged even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh into the controversy as Ahluwalia played a dual role as Manmohan's right-hand man in the G20 meeting
 yah vivaad tab or bhi gambhir mudda ban gaya jab paryaavaran mantralay or kuch had tak videsh mantralay bhi isamen kud pade or unhone daleel di ki isse jalwaayu parivartan par bharat ke vyapak rukh ko jokhim main daal diya gaya he
 As a result, when Manmohan traveled to the US last year, he had to use his political wealth to open up a two-way dialogue to gain some time so that this sensitive, far-reaching impact on developing countries like India Various aspects of the issue can be investigated
 modi ke aane ke saath sthiti badal gai
 The Environment Ministry still took a tough stance against the Montreal Protocol, discussing the phased removal of hfcs, let alone talk
 mantralay ne to yahaan tak daleel di ki china kaa bhi vahi rukh he jo hamaara he or donon desh milakar antarrashtriya manch par jabardast sabit ho sakate hai
 It is another matter that the ministry forgot that Beijing is known for its last-minute two-way bargaining
 sutara bataate hai ki pradhanmantri ne suzav ko ek jhtke main naamanzoor kar diya
 He said that India cannot take such a narrow view on issues of global importance
 nateeja yah hua ki bharat ne bharat-america sanyukt vaktavy main montrial protocol ke tahat sansthaaon kii shuchita kaa anumodan kar diya or echensi ko charanbaddh tareeke se hataane par charchaa ke liye kadam uthaane par sahmati jataa di
 Now the first step will be to have a two-way dialogue immediately before the next meeting of the Montreal Protocol, which will consider "the safety, cost and commercial access to new technology to remove hfcs"
 modi ne ek jatke main america kii ek badi chintaa kaa samaadhaan kar diya, us ek chintaa kaa jis par unke purvadhikari ne gharelu rajnatik dabaav kii vajah se haath peeche khinch liye the
 Similarly, Modi was far more prepared to compromise on the politically more sensitive issue of discussing farm subsidies and agriculture in the World Trade Organization
 khaskar us vakt jab ise vaanijya mantralay kii siforeeshon kii roshni main dekha jaae
 Sources reveal that the ministry wanted to raise voice for such far-reaching exemptions and concessions that apply not only to existing programs but also to new schemes in the near future
 vah chahta tha ki krishi sabsidi ke samooche dhaanche ko nae sire se tay kiya jaae
 This would have meant reopening all previous agreements and it would have been equivalent to dismantling the non-proliferation Treaty
 isse baatcheet shuru hone se pehle hi bikhar jaati
 More importantly, the offer of such a proposal would have sent a different message to America
 pradhanmantri halaat ko or zyada bigaadia nahin chaahate the
 He decided that this is not the time to go into specifics
 isaki bajaae unhone ek ore vyapaar suvidha samjhauton kaa khulaa samarthan karke or duusari ore vishwa vyapaar sanghathan or krishi par zyada khule dotarafa samvaad ke liye jor dekar mudde ko sakaaratmak rukh diya
 In short, his message to his subordinates was clear: India should not be isolated on such issues and therefore this intention of working together should be reflected in the joint statement as well
 isse yah bhi saaf ho gaya ki ve shantipurna parmaanu urja anubandhon main rukaawat ban rahe javabdehi ke muddon ko sulajhane ke liye bhi patibaddh hai
 Shared maneuvers The greatest achievement of this America trip is the technology of warships
 is pramukh ranneetik sahmati kaa saarvajanik elaan nahin kiya gaya or ise pratiraksha sahyog par bhavishya kii ore dekhne vaale baton kii aad main chipaaya gaya
 Sources told India Today that talks are on with the US to acquire state-of-the-art technology like aircraft launching systems
 yah pranali us aircraft karier par lagaai jaaegi jo bharat apane balboote viksit kar rahaa he
 Indeed, shipbuilding is an area in which American defense technology cooperation is expected to increase in the coming days
 yah bharat ko aparaajey kshamtaaon ke saath nausainya shakti banane ke samgr prayaason kaa hissaa he
 It is also a matter of mutual partnership and strategic priority for the two countries
 pratiraksha agenda ko aage badhaane ko lekar modi ke man main koi hichak nahin thi
 He even asked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to partner with Indian companies and set up factories in India
 lekin unhone apni sakaaratmak manshaa kaa sanket america ke saath diya or uski ek bahut puraani maang maan lee
 This demand was to carry out two-way Malabar exercises more advanced and on a larger scale
 america lambey samay se chahta tha ki in yuddhayaason main or zyada deshon ko shaamil kiya jaae or inhen sachche arthon main bahudeshiy banaakar inke kaaryakshetra ko badhaayaa jaae
 Former Minister of Defense A
 ke
 However, Antony was strongly against it
 unhone us vakt suraksha maamalon kii mantrimandaleey samiti se yah baat manavaa lee thi ki bharat ko aisi kisi sainik gatividhi main bhaag nahin lenaa chahie jo china ke khilaaf jaraa bhi gathbandhan kii tarah dikhaai de
 Modi did not rethink this decision at all
 america ab ummid karata he ki is faisle ke baad alese (logisticks saport agreement) or siisamoe (communication and information security memorondom of agreement) sareekhe kuch pramukh samjhauton ko antim rup diya jayega
 These are the agreements that will allow joint exercises to be conducted more regularly and create an environment in which the two countries can work together
 upie sarkaar in samjhauton par dastakhat karnaa nahin chaahati thi kyonki use dar tha ki ye bharat ko america ke paale main dhakel denge
 Whatever decision Modi will take on these agreements in the coming days will determine how far and to what extent his government's long-term strategic inclination goes
 sutara bataate hai ki philhal modi kii shuruaati peshkash main itani kashish to thi hi ki ve washington se anukool jawaab hasil kar saken
 American business companies also showed positive stance despite concerns over a number of issues, such as taxation applied to the former effect
 kar-nirdhaaran ke maamle main bhi modi sarkaar ne har tareeke se vishwaas dilaane kii koshish to kii lekin sampurna aashwaasan dene se parhez bartaa
 Even the attitude of the US government was very supportive and showed readiness to join almost every initiative of Modi from smart cities to clean India
 kaarobaari rishton ke ranneetik prabhaav bhi tab jaahir ho gaye jab blakerock ke siio laurence phinc ne agle saal farvari main bharat main global inwestors conference yojit karne kii peshkash kii or usase kam se kam 6 arab dollar ke nivesh kaa bharosa dilaayaa
 Sources reveal that the Prime Minister's eyes flashed at that time and he promised that he himself would attend this conference
 dhyaan dene kii baat yah he ki blakerock ne america ke saath ranneetik saajhedaari main bandhe canada or mexico sareekhe pramukh deshon ke liye aisi hi conference yojit kii hai or unamem khaasi safalataa hasil kii he
 It is too early to say about future gunfire
 vishwa manch par jabardast shakti pradarshan ke ek maah baad saaf he ki modi kii yojanaon main america kaa ahm sthaan he
 In this sense, he has played a strong early innings - perhaps the most favorable innings for an Indian prime minister in his first visit to America

 It is also called Vanagni
 uttarakhand ke jangalon kii dadhakati tasveeron ko dekhte hi kai logon ne lekh likhaa ki ye sankat 'main maid' he
 'man Made' means that man has called it, not nature
 lekin is 'main maid' kaa koi cheharaa nahin hota
 But 'man Made' has two faces here
 ek cheharaa sarkaar or uske banaae kanoon kaa bhi he
 Saying 'man made' does not show the role of the government and its systems in these reasons
 kai baar lagata he ki vahaan ke sthaneey logon kii bhoomika hoti he
 There are many times when mountains are converted into concrete forest through encroachment and so on
 ek tisare prakaar ke log hote hai jinka cheharaa is 'main maid' kii shabdaawalee se nahin jhalkata he

 DP, must have known Sachchidananda Bharati
 gandhivadi or chipko andolan se jude rahe sachchidanand bharti 1974 se uttarakhand main jangalon ko bachaane or pani ke sangrakshan ke puraane taur-tareekon ko zindaa karne ke kaam main lage hai
 You would rarely see pictures of such people on TV and Bharti ji does not even want to come on TV
 unhen lagata he ki kaam vahi hota he jo chupchaap kiya jaae
 Sachchidanand Bharti has received Indira Gandhi National Environment Award
 maine inhin sachchidanandji ko phone kiya ki is sankat ke bahaane main apane darshakon ko kya nayaa bataa saktaa hum, jisase wo sankat ko samajhen bhi or jangalon se unka ek rishta bane
 Whatever type of political parties they vote for, they can talk on topics other than hindu-muslim topics
 pehle aap is tasviir ko dekhiye
 You see five pits
 aisa lag rahaa hoga ki inamen barsaat kaa pani bhar gaya he
 They are usually called chawl skins
 chote chote gaddhon main pani bharaa ho to use jal tilaiya kehete hai
 The pond, which looks like a swimming bridge amidst a lot of greenery, is called khal
 khaal aakaar main badi hoti he
 Chal is seen in the shape of a canal
 samudr tal se 2000 meter kii oonchai par bani hui hai ye sabhi chaal khaalen
 In the common tongue, you can call them small ponds
 sachchidanand bharti ji ne bataaya ki pehle gaanv-gaanv main isi tarah oonchai par chaal khaal banati thi
 Rain water was stored in them
 barsaat ke baad vahaan se pani neeche kii taraf risataa he or jangalon main nami banane lagati he
 Wherever the land is, it moves like a skin
 ye kachche gadde hote hai jinase pani dhire dhire risataa rahata he
 On their way to grow, green grass grows up to one to two meters
 nateeja yah hota he ki jangalon main aag bhi lagati he to hari ghaas ke kaaran fail nahin paati he
 Sachchidanand Bharti has made 2000 such skins in his life
 unka kahana he ki in chaal khaalon kii vajah se unke ilaake main aag nahin lagi he kyonki vahaan nami he
 There is water
 sahasr taal ek jagah bhi he yani hazaar taalon kii jagal
 It is between Gangotri and Kedarnath
 uttarakhand ke sundartam jhiilon main se ek mana jaataa he
 Bharti ji said that if these tricks were made of skins, it would not be foolish to extinguish fire with helicopters today
 isliye to ham helicopter uda rahe hai kyonki hamane chaal khaalon ko bananaa band kar diya
 That is why Chennai was drowned because we filled the ponds and built apartments there
 kahaan to hamen shame aani chahie apni puraani harkaton par, lekin hamaara dhyaan helicopter kii vir ras vaali tasveeron par hai
 The voice that comes from it creates a thrill in us that we can overcome every mischief of nature in our time
 chennai main bhi yahi helicopter ud rahaa tha
 This means that the helicopters are flying so much that we have done so much damage to the forest of our land that now before the Ram trusts, the army is now confident and the soldiers of the army do these tasks with complete efficiency
 jaan kii baazi laga dete hai
 See where the helicopters are flying with water to extinguish the fire in the forests of Uttarakhand
 us jagah kaa naam he bhimtal
 It is from here that we fill the water and extinguish the fire
 agar paryaapt sankhya main chaal or khaal bani hoti to shaayad ye naubat nahin aati
 You will not find any mention of trick skins in the schemes of our governments or even for the name
 ab logon ko bhi chaal khaal ke bare main pataa nahin he or van adhikariyon ko bhi nahin
 Kosi was flooded in Bihar
 yaad kiijie kitne log dub kar mar gaye isliye ki vahaan ke log tairnaa bhul gaye the
 Whereas in every story of Kosi, there is mention of boat and swimmers
 ek or gandhivadi anupam mishra ne likhaa tha ki dub rahaa he tairne vaala samaaj
 The picture of the trick skin is telling that the forests are burning because Uttarakhand has forgotten its own way to extinguish the fire
 van panchayatein jab sakriy hoti thi tab barish ke dinon main hi chaal khaalen banani shuru ho jaati thim
 To understand the fire spreading in Uttarakhand, you have to understand about the forest panchayats
 gram panchayaton ke bare main to aapane suna hi he
 You must have heard about forest panchayats but have forgotten
 sarkaar bhi bhul gai he or van adhikari bhi
 In 1931, the British Government made the Kumaon Panchayat Forest Rules
 pahaado ke logon ko wanon ke prabandhan kaa jimmaa diya gaya
 It is said that 12,600 forests are made in Uttarakhand and they are also empowered under a law
 asaliyat yah he ki in van panchayaton kaa koi ata pataa nahin he
 Had it been active, it would not have to rain water from helicopters to extinguish the fire today
 sena bulani nahin padati
 There are three types of land in the mountains
 ek zamin hoti he sarkaar kii
 These are called quas forest forests i
e
 jungle forest
 duusari zamin hoti jise civil soyam bhoomi kehete hai
 The village is controlled by this but the government is also involved
 jangal yaa chaare kii vanaspati lagane main sarkaar bhi madad karti he
 The third land is the village's own land
 us zamin par log jangal lagaate hai
 Forest Panchayats are formed on the remaining land leaving class one i
e
 government land
 inkaa koi bajet nahin hota magar gaanv ke har parivaar se ek vyakti van panchayat kaa sadsy hota he
 It is compulsory to have fifty percent males and fifty percent females in Van Panchayat
 agar sarkaar wanon ke liye apni yojanaon ko in van panchayaton ke zariye lagu karaati, sakriy rakhti to van adhikari, sthaneey vibhaagon or van panchayat ke zariye aam logon ke bich ek rishta jari rahata
 Van panchayats used to prepare to extinguish the fire from the month of december-january which is no longer there
 jab tak logon kaa jangalon par adhikaar nahin hoga tab tak ve jangal ko apana kyon samajhenge
 Many times they have been deprived of the law and many times people are not able to make biological connections to these forests due to being implicated in the name of law
 vahaan ke logon ke liye bhi jangal utane hi paraaye hai jitne aap or ham paryatakon ke liye
 You have to think how the society that has been living with the forest for centuries has become so unknown
 ye dooriyaan aaj kii nahin hai, ye bhi dashakon se hamane banaai hai
 There is also a song
 yun banja burasaan rakkha jagavaali, yun kaa pattiyon maa doodh, jadon maa pani
 This means guarding the oak burras because they have water in the roots and milk in the leaves
 ab ham pani kahin or se uda kar laa rahe hai
 In their time, the British started building fire lines along the road of traffic
 jinhen hindi main aag suraksha pattee kehete hai
 It used to be a kind of pit where the forest department used to collect leaves and burn them in november-december
 chid kii sukhi pattiyaan samaapt ho jaati thim
 The fire did not spread in the november-december humidity
 garmi main ek tili se fail gai
 Does the forest department not have sufficient staff now? ab ye sab kaam to mobile ap se nahin hoga
 Will be with man and man will be related to society and government only
 kai jagahon par aag suraksha pattiyaan banati bhi nahin hai
 This shows that the Forest Department, which is still doing a lot of work, was lost somewhere else at that time
 log bhi pattiyon ko chun laate the
 But now the law is afraid of sarkaar jitna bhi aashwaasan de unhen pataa he ki koi dhara aisi hogi jiskaa istemaal kar liya jayega
 Sachchidananda Bharati said one thing
 aag chid nahin lagaataa he
 The fire burns
 chid kii pattee ko pirul kehete hai
 Once upon a time, people of Uttarakhand used to make coal from this Pirul
 ab kanoon ke bhay ke kaaran koyala nahin bana pate
 Previously, they used to select pine leaves for making coal
 ek bade se dibbe main band kar pattiyon ko jalaayaa jaataa tha
 The carbon escaped and coal was left
 sookhe patton ke upyog ko rojgaar se nahin jodenge to kitne lakh karmchaaree lagaakar aap in patton ko chunavaayenge
 If you understand this basic thing, then you can get the root of the problem
 ab ye pratha khatm ho gai
 Uttarakhand Additional Chief Secretary s Ramaswamy said that there were 121 fire incidents on 3 May
 95 ko kaabo kar liya gaya he
 At present, the number of active fires is reported to be 26
 somvaar ko yah sankhya 40 thi
 70 on Sunday
 isse sanket mil rahaa he ki aag ke bade hisse par niyantran paa liya gaya he
 For this, 11,160 employees of the state have been employed
 rashtriya or rajya aapadaa prabandhan bal ke log bhi kaam main jute hai
 The Mi-17 helicopter has taken 16 flights to Nainital and Pauri
 chaar logon kii maut ho chuki he or 16 ghayal bataaye ja rahe hai
 So far, 1591 incidents of Vanagni have been reported
 jaanboojh kar aag lagane ke 46 maamle darj kiye gaye hai
 The same situation is in Himachal Pradesh
 vahaan ke 12 main se 8 zilon main dawanal fail chukaa he
 Fire incidents have been reported in the state since a month
 aag pichley saal bhi lagi thi
 It takes place every year
 is baar zyada bade paimaane par lagi he lekin ham aise jaage hai jaise pehali baar lagi ho
 The damage that has been done to the forests from the environment is not going to be compensated so easily and quickly
 vaise ham sochate hai ki is aag main sirf jangal jalte hai lekin aisa nahin he, pashu-pakshiyon kaa bhi is aag main bhayanak nuksaan hota he jo jangal kii aag main ghir jate hai
 Especially the eggs of birds, etc
 are burnt
 reptiles yani sarisrup prajati ke jaanavar iskaa bada shikaar banate hai jo jangal main aag kii se baahar nahin nikal pate, saath hi kai bade jaanavar bhi is aag se batch nahin pate
 Apart from the institutions made by humans, another responsible is the pine
 kai logon ne kaha ki chid ke kaaran dawanal failaa he
 The forest fire is called forest fire
 kya chid ke kaaran hi sab kuch hua
 Is this the villain? ham ek aise samay main rah rahe hai jahaan suchanaaen rocket kii raftaar se aa rahi hai or chali ja rahi hai
 You must have seen pine trees
 aahen bhari hongi
 Fire is coming out from these trees
 susheel bahuguna ne chid ke pedo ke bare main uplabdh jaankariyon kii cheerfaad kii he
 What we want to tell you here
 chid ek conipheras yani shankudhari ped he
 Its leaves are pointed
 pahaado main ye ped aath sau meter se 1800 meter kii oonchai tak hota he
 There is a general belief that, like Eucalyptus, the British brought the pine from Europe, but it is not so
 chid kaa ped karodon saal se himalay ke pahari ilaakon main paaya jaataa he or himalay ke jangalon ko banane main isaki ek badi bhoomika rahi he
 The comments chid ko kudarat ne darasal aisi jagahon ke liye viksit kiya jahaan tikhi dhalaan hon, chattani ilaaka ho, mitti kii parat bahut kam ho yaa naa ke baraabar ho, pani bahut kam ho, tej or sidhi dhoop aati ho
 Pine was prepared by nature for such mountain slopes, therefore pine is also needed to maintain balance in the ecology
 chid kaa vyavsaayik istemaal bhi khub hota he
 The wood of this tree is used in building houses and other works
 chid kii kuch prajatiyon kii lakdi kaagaz banane ke kaam bhi aati he
 The resin that comes out of it is also useful
 isiike distilation se tarapentine oil banataa he
 The question is why the pine tree is becoming a cause of fire in the jungles of the mountains
 darasal vyavsaayik kaarnon se chid kaa bade paimaane par plantesan hua
 Earlier, along with the plantation, the pine was harvested for timber, but after 1981 the cutting of all kinds of trees was stopped after 1000 meters
 iskaa sabase zyaada faaydaa chid ne uthaaya
 He also settled in forests of mixed vegetation like banj, burras and cedars
 dhire-dhire chid ne baaki prajatiyon ke pedo kii jagah lenaa shuru kar diya
 One peculiarity of pine is that it does not allow any other species of tree to grow around it
 chid ko jab in jangalon main kaata nahin gaya to usne chaudee pattee ke jangalon kii jagah chhinani shuru kar di
 The result was that the expansion of the pine greatly increased
 is vistaar kii vajah se jangalon main aag kaa bhi vistaar hua kyonki chid kaa ped jangal main aag ko tezi se failaata he
 When the pine leaves dry, they catch fire very quickly
 garmiyon main chid kii pattiyaan jangalon main ek carpet kii tarah fail jaati hai or ek halki si chingaari bhi badi aag kii shakl main tezi se failane lagati he
 The resin from the pine which is called LISA also acts as a fire
 chid ke jangalon se faili ye aag duusari vanaspatiyon ko jala detii he
 Pine forests do not work much for animals and birds either
 chid kii pattiyaan pinic acid banaati hai jisase mitti acidic ho jaati he
 Pine trees are not much capable of preventing soil erosion from rain
 chid ke jangalon main jal strot suukh jate hai, kyonki mitti main nami qaayam nahin rah paati
 But this expansion of pine was due to human reasons, so it would not be right to call pine as the villain of the forest
 jahaan kuch or nahin hota vahaan chid hota he or wo bada jangal banaata he
 We gave him a place to grow in places that were not his
 uttarakhand ke jangalon kii dadhakati tasveeron ko dekhte hi kai logon ne lekh likhaa ki ye sankat 'main maid' he
 'man Made' means that man has called it, not nature
 lekin is 'main maid' kaa koi cheharaa nahin hota

 vaise ham sochate hai ki is aag main sirf jangal jalte hai lekin aisa nahin he, pashu-pakshiyon kaa bhi is aag main bhayanak nuksaan hota he jo jangal kii aag main ghir jate hai
 Especially the eggs of birds, etc
 are burnt
 reptiles yani sarisrup prajati ke jaanavar iskaa bada shikaar banate hai jo jangal main aag kii se baahar nahin nikal pate, saath hi kai bade jaanavar bhi is aag se batch nahin pate
 Apart from the institutions made by humans, another responsible is the pine
 kai logon ne kaha ki chid ke kaaran dawanal failaa he
 The forest fire is called forest fire
 kya chid ke kaaran hi sab kuch hua
 Is this the villain? ham ek aise samay main rah rahe hai jahaan suchanaaen rocket kii raftaar se aa rahi hai or chali ja rahi hai
 You must have seen pine trees
 aahen bhari hongi
 Fire is coming out from these trees
 susheel bahuguna ne chid ke pedo ke bare main uplabdh jaankariyon kii cheerfaad kii he
 What we want to tell you here
 chid ek conipheras yani shankudhari ped he
 Its leaves are pointed
 pahaado main ye ped aath sau meter se 1800 meter kii oonchai tak hota he
 There is a general belief that, like Eucalyptus, the British brought the pine from Europe, but it is not so
 chid kaa ped karodon saal se himalay ke pahari ilaakon main paaya jaataa he or himalay ke jangalon ko banane main isaki ek badi bhoomika rahi he
 The comments chid ko kudarat ne darasal aisi jagahon ke liye viksit kiya jahaan tikhi dhalaan hon, chattani ilaaka ho, mitti kii parat bahut kam ho yaa naa ke baraabar ho, pani bahut kam ho, tej or sidhi dhoop aati ho
 Pine was prepared by nature for such mountain slopes, therefore pine is also needed to maintain balance in the ecology
 chid kaa vyavsaayik istemaal bhi khub hota he
 The wood of this tree is used in building houses and other works
 chid kii kuch prajatiyon kii lakdi kaagaz banane ke kaam bhi aati he
 The resin that comes out of it is also useful
 isiike distilation se tarapentine oil banataa he
 The question is why the pine tree is becoming a cause of fire in the jungles of the mountains
 darasal vyavsaayik kaarnon se chid kaa bade paimaane par plantesan hua
 Earlier, along with the plantation, the pine was harvested for timber, but after 1981 the cutting of all kinds of trees was stopped after 1000 meters
 iskaa sabase zyaada faaydaa chid ne uthaaya
 He also settled in forests of mixed vegetation like banj, burras and cedars
 dhire-dhire chid ne baaki prajatiyon ke pedo kii jagah lenaa shuru kar diya
 One peculiarity of pine is that it does not allow any other species of tree to grow around it
 chid ko jab in jangalon main kaata nahin gaya to usne chaudee pattee ke jangalon kii jagah chhinani shuru kar di
 The result was that the expansion of the pine greatly increased
 is vistaar kii vajah se jangalon main aag kaa bhi vistaar hua kyonki chid kaa ped jangal main aag ko tezi se failaata he
 When the pine leaves dry, they catch fire very quickly
 garmiyon main chid kii pattiyaan jangalon main ek carpet kii tarah fail jaati hai or ek halki si chingaari bhi badi aag kii shakl main tezi se failane lagati he
 The resin from the pine which is called LISA also acts as a fire
 chid ke jangalon se faili ye aag duusari vanaspatiyon ko jala detii he
 Pine forests do not work much for animals and birds either
 chid kii pattiyaan pinic acid banaati hai jisase mitti acidic ho jaati he
 Pine trees are not much capable of preventing soil erosion from rain
 chid ke jangalon main jal strot suukh jate hai, kyonki mitti main nami qaayam nahin rah paati
 But this expansion of pine was due to human reasons, so it would not be right to call pine as the villain of the forest
 jahaan kuch or nahin hota vahaan chid hota he or wo bada jangal banaata he
 We gave him a place to grow in places that were not his
 jangalon ke bare main jo log adhyayan karte hai yaa jo jangalon se disple pikchar yani deepi se zyada pyaar karte hai wo sachchidanand bharti ko jaanate hi honge
 Sachchidananda Bharti, a Gandhian and associated with the Chipko movement, has been working since 1974 to save forests in Uttarakhand and revive old ways of conserving water
 aap aise logon kii tasviren tivi par kam hi dekhte honge or bharti ji tivi par aana bhi nahin chaahate
 They feel that work is what is done silently
 sachchidanand bharti ko indiragandhi rashtriya paryaavaran puraskaar mil chukaa he
 i called the same Sachchidanandji that what new can i tell my audience on the pretext of this crisis, so that they can understand the crisis and they have a relationship with the forests
 ve jis bhi prakaar ke raajnneetik dalon ko vot dete hon unase hindu-muslim topic ke alaava bhi anya vishyon par baat kar saken
 First you see this picture
 aapako paanch gadde dikhaai de rahe hai
 It must have seemed that the rainwater has been filled in them
 aam taur par inhen chaal khaal kehete hai
 If there is water in small pits, it is called water tank
 kaaphi hariyaali ke bich swimming pul kii tarah jo talab dikhataa he, use khaal kehete hai
 The skins are large in size
 chaal nahar kii shakl main dikhte hai
 All these moves are made at an altitude of 2000 meters above sea level
 aam jubaan main aap inhen chote talab kah sakate hai
 Sachchidanand Bharti ji said that earlier in the village, the same way the gait skin was made at the same height
 inamen barsaat kaa pani jamaa hota tha
 After the rain, the water rushes down from there and moisture starts forming in the forests
 jahaan jaisi zamin hoti he waisi chaal khaal banati he
 These are raw pits from which water keeps seeping slowly
 inke risne ke raste main ek do meter tak hari ghaas ug aati he
 The result is that even if there is a fire in the forests, it does not spread due to green grass
 sachchidanand bharti ne apni ek zindagi main aisi 2000 chaal khaalen banavaa di hai
 He says that because of these trick skins, there is no fire in his area because there is moisture there
 pani he
 Sahasra Tal is also a place, that is, the jugal of thousand talas
 gangotri or kedarnath ke bich main he
 It is considered one of the prettiest lakes of Uttarakhand
 bharti ji ne bataaya ki agar ye chaal khaalen bani hoti to aaj helicopter se aag bujhane kii morrkhtaa nahin kerani padati
 That is why we are flying helicopters because we stopped making motion skins
 chennai isiilie to dub gaya kyonki hamane talabon ko bhar kar vahaan apartment bana diye
 Wherever we should be ashamed of our old antics, but our focus is on the pictures of the heroic heroic images
 isse aane vaali awaz hamaare bheetar romaanch paidaa karti he ki ham apane samay main prakruti kii har sharaarat par kaabo paa sakate hai
 The same helicopter was also flying in Chennai
 is helicopter ke udne kaa yahi matlab he ki hamane apni dharti jangal kaa itnaa nuksaan kar diya he ki ram bharose se pehle ab sena kaa hi bharosa he or sena ke jawan puri mustaidi se ye kaam karte bhi hai
 Lives of life
 aap dekhiye ki uttarakhand ke jangalon main lagi aag ko bujhane ke liye helicopter kahaan se pani bhar kar ud rahe hai
 The name of that place is Bhimtal
 yaheen se pani bharte hai or aag bujhaate hai
 If a sufficient number of tricks and skins had been made, it might not have happened
 chaal khaalon kaa zikr aapako hamaari sarkaron kii yojanaon main yaa to nahin milegaa yaa milegaa bhi to naam ke liye
 Now people do not even know about the chawls and not even the forest officials
 bihar main kosi main baadh ai thi
 Remember how many people drowned because they forgot to swim there
 jabaki kosi ke har kisse main naav or tairne waalon kaa zikr miltaa he
 Another Gandhian Anupam Mishra wrote that the sinking society is sinking
 chaal khaal kii tasviir bataa rahi he ki jal rahe hai jangal kyonki bhul gaya he uttarakhand aag bujhane kii apni hi tarkeeb
 When the forest panchayats were active, chal skins started being formed during the rainy days
 uttarakhand main faili aag ko samajhane ke liye aapako van panchayaton ke bare main samajhnaa hi padegaa
 You have already heard about gram panchayats
 van panchayaton ke bare main bhi suna hoga magar bhul gaye honge
 The government has forgotten and the forest officer too
 1931 main british sarkaar ne kumaun panchayat van niyam banaae
 The people of the mountains were given the responsibility of managing the forests
 kaha jaataa he ki uttarakhand main 12,600 van pachaanyate bani hai or inhen ek kanoon ke tahat adhikaar bhi diya gaya he
 The fact is that there is no trace of these Van Panchayats
 agar ye sakriy hoti to aaj aag bujhane ke liye helicopter se pani kii barsaat nahin kerani padati
 Army does not have to call
 pahaado main teen tarah kii zamin hoti he
 The government has a land
 inhen kwas van forest kehete hai yani jangle ke jangal
 The other land used to be called Civil Soyam Bhoomi
 is par gaanv kaa niyantran hota he lekin sarkaar bhi shaamil hoti he
 The government also helps in planting forest or fodder vegetation
 teesri bhoomi hoti he jo gaanv kii apni bhoomi hoti he
 People plant a forest on that land
 class van yani sarkari zamin chhod kar baaki zamin par van panchayaton kaa gathan hota he
 They do not have a budget, but from every family in the village, one person is a member of the Van Panchayat
 van panchayat main pachaas fisadi purush or pachaas fisadi mahilaon kaa hona anivaary he
 If the government had implemented its plans for forests through these forest panchayats, it would have continued to have a relationship between the forest officer, local departments and the common people through the forest panchayat
 van panchayatein disambar-janvari ke maheene se aag bujhane kii taiyaari kar leti thim jo ab nahin hoti he
 Until the people have the right over the forests, why would they consider the forest as their own
 kai baar kanoon se unhen vanchit kiya gaya he or kai baar kanoon ke naam par fansaa diye jane ke kaaran log in jangalon se jaivik sambandh nahin bana pate hai
 The forests are as alien to the people there as for you and us tourists
 aapako sochna to padegaa ki jo samaaj sadiyon se jangal ke saath ji rahaa he wo itnaa anjaan kaise ho gaya
 These distances are not today, we have also made these decades
 ek geet bhi he
 Yun Banja Burasan Rakha Jagwali, Yun's leaves mother milk, roots water
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki banj burans kii rakhwali isliye karo kyonki inaki jadon main pani he or pattiyon main doodh he
 Now we are bringing water from somewhere else
 angrezon ne apane samay main yatayaat ke maarg ke kinare fire line banani shuru kii
 Which are called fire protection bandage in Hindi
 yah ek tarah kaa gaddha hi hota tha jahaan pattiyon ko jamaa kar van vibhaag november-disambar main jala detaa tha
 Dry pine leaves were eliminated
 november-disambar kii nami main aag failati bhi nahin thi
 In summer, a stick spread
 kya pataa van vibhaag ke paas ab paryaapt karmchaaree bhi na ho
 Now all this will not work with the mobile app
 aadmi se hoga or aadmi kaa rishta samaaj or sarkaar se hoga tabhi hoga
 Fire safety straps are not even made in many places
 isse pataa chalata he ki van vibhaag jo abhi kaaphi kaam karata hua dikh rahaa he us vakt kahin or khoyaa hua tha
 People also used to pick leaves
 magar ab kanoon kaa dar sataata he
 Whatever assurance the government gives, they know that there will be such a clause which will be used
 sachchidanand bharti ne ek baat kahi
 Does not set fire
 aag to tili lagaati he
 Pine leaf is called Pirul
 ek jamaane main uttarakhand ke log is pirul se koyala bana lete the
 Now due to fear of law, we are unable to make coal
 pehle koyala banane ke liye chid kii pattiyon ko chun laate the
 The leaves were lit in a large box
 carbon baahar nikal jaataa tha or koyala bachaa rah jaataa tha
 If you do not associate the use of dry leaves with employment, then by applying how many employees, you will choose these leaves
 is buniyadi baat ko samajhenge to samasya kii jad pakad sakate hai
 Now this practice is over
 uttarakhand ke apper mukhya sachiv es ramasvami ne kaha ki 3 may ko aag lagane kii 121 ghatnaayen hui hai
 95 has been controlled
 is vakt sakriy aag kii sankhya 26 bataai ja rahi he
 The number was 40 on Monday
 ravivaar ko 70
 This indicates that large parts of the fire have been controlled
 iske liye rajya ke 11,160 karmchaariyon ko kaam main lagaaya gaya he
 People from national and state disaster management forces are also working
 emai-17 helicopter ne nainital or paudi main 16 udaanen bhari hai
 Four people have died and 16 are said to be injured
 abhi tak vanagni kii 1591 ghatnaayen darj ho chuki hai
 46 cases of willful fire have been registered
 vahi haal himachal pradesh kaa he
 In 8 of the 12 districts there, the forest cover has been spread
 ek maheene se soobe main aag kii ghatnaayen darj ho rahi hai
 The fire was also set last year
 har saal lagati he
 This time it is engaged on a much larger scale, but we are awake like it was the first time
 paryaavaran se lekar jangalon kaa jo nuksaan hua he uski bharpai itani aasaani or jaldi to nahin hone vaali
 By the way, we think that in this fire only forests are burnt, but it is not so, animals and birds also suffer terrible losses in this fire
 khaastaur par pakshiyon ke andey vagairah jal jate hai
 Reptiles, the animals of the reptile species, become the big prey of this, who are not able to get out of the fire in the forest, as well as many big animals do not survive this fire
 insaanon kii banaai sansthaaon ke alaava ek or zimmedaar he chid
 Many people said that the pineapple has spread due to pine
 dawanal jangalon kii aag ko kehete hai
 Did everything happen due to pine? kya ye khalanaayak hi he
 We are living in a time where information is coming and going at rocket speed
 aapane chid ke pedo ko dekha hoga
 Sighs will be filled
 inhen pedo se aag nikal rahi he
 Sushil Bahuguna has disseminated the available information about pine trees
 jo ham aapako yahaan bataanaa chaahate hai
 Pine is a coniferous tree
 isaki pattiyaan nukili hoti hai
 These trees range from eight hundred meters to 1800 meters in the mountains
 ek aam dharna he ki eucalyptus kii tarah chid ko bhi angrez europe se lekar aae, lekin aisa nahin he
 Pine tree has been found in the Himalayan hills for millions of years and has played a major role in creating the Himalayan forests
 tippaniyan Nature has been developed for places where there are steep slopes, rocky terrain, little or no soil layer, very little water, strong and direct sunlight
 aisi pahari dhalaanon ke liye chid ko prakruti ne taiyaar kiya tha, isiilie paristhitiki main santulan banaae rakhane ke liye chid kii bhi zarurat he
 Pine is also used commercially
 is ped kii lakdi makaan banane or duusare kaamon main istemaal hoti he
 Wood of some species of pine is also used in paper making
 isse nikalne vaala racin yani lisa bhi kai kaam aata he
 Its distillation produces turpentine oil
 sawaal ye he ki itane kaam kaa ped chid kyon pahaado ke jangalon main aag kii ek vajah ban rahaa he
 Actually, due to commercial reasons, there was large scale plantation of pine
 pehle plantesan ke saath-saath chid ko timber ke liye kaata bhi jaataa tha, lekin 1981 ke baad 1000 meter ke baad har tarah ke ped ke kaatane par roak lag gai
 Chir took the most advantage of it
 wo banj, burans or deodaar jaise mishrit vanaspati ke jangalon main bhi bas gaya
 Gradually the pine began to replace the trees of the rest of the species
 chid kii ek khaasiyat ye he ki wo apane aasapaas kisi duusari prajati ke ped ko panpane nahin detaa
 When the pine was not harvested in these forests, it started snatching the place of broad leaf forests
 nateeja ye hua ki chid kaa vistaar bahut bad gaya
 Due to this expansion, the fire in the forests also expanded because the pine tree spreads the fire in the forest rapidly
 chid kii pattiyaan jab suukh jaati hai to badi tezi se aag pakadati hai
 In summer, the pine leaves spread like a carpet in the forests, and a slight spark also spreads rapidly in the form of a large fire
 chid se nikalne vaala rezin jise lisa kehete hai wo bhi aag bhadakaane kaa kaam karata he
 These fires spread from pine forests burn other flora
 chid ke jangal pashu-pakshiyon ke bhi zyaada kaam nahin aate
 Pine leaves make pineic acid, which makes the soil acidic
 chid ke ped barish se mitti kaa kataav rokane main zyada sakasham nahin hote
 Water sources in the pine forests dry up, because moisture in the soil is unable to be retained
 lekin chid kaa ye vistaar insaani vajahon se hua, isliye chid ko jangal kaa villen kahana thik nahin hoga
 Where nothing else happens there is a pine and it makes a big forest
 hamane hi use un jagahon par panpane ke liye jagah di jo jagah uski nahin thi

 These fires spread from pine forests burn other flora
 chid ke jangal pashu-pakshiyon ke bhi zyaada kaam nahin aate
 Pine leaves make pineic acid, which makes the soil acidic
 chid ke ped barish se mitti kaa kataav rokane main zyada sakasham nahin hote
 Water sources in the pine forests dry up, because moisture in the soil is unable to be retained
 lekin chid kaa ye vistaar insaani vajahon se hua, isliye chid ko jangal kaa villen kahana thik nahin hoga
 Where nothing else happens there is a pine and it makes a big forest
 hamane hi use un jagahon par panpane ke liye jagah di jo jagah uski nahin thi
 First you see this picture
 aapako paanch gadde dikhaai de rahe hai
 It must have seemed that the rainwater has been filled in them
 aam taur par inhen chaal khaal kehete hai
 If there is water in small pits, it is called water tank
 kaaphi hariyaali ke bich swimming pul kii tarah jo talab dikhataa he, use khaal kehete hai
 The skins are large in size
 chaal nahar kii shakl main dikhte hai
 All these moves are made at an altitude of 2000 meters above sea level
 aam jubaan main aap inhen chote talab kah sakate hai
 Sachchidanand Bharti ji said that earlier in the village, the same way the gait skin was made at the same height
 inamen barsaat kaa pani jamaa hota tha
 After the rain, the water rushes down from there and moisture starts forming in the forests
 jahaan jaisi zamin hoti he waisi chaal khaal banati he
 These are raw pits from which water keeps seeping slowly
 inke risne ke raste main ek do meter tak hari ghaas ug aati he
 The result is that even if there is a fire in the forests, it does not spread due to green grass
 sachchidanand bharti ne apni ek zindagi main aisi 2000 chaal khaalen banavaa di hai
 He says that because of these trick skins, there is no fire in his area because there is moisture there
 pani he
 Sahasra Tal is also a place, that is, the jugal of thousand talas
 gangotri or kedarnath ke bich main he
 It is considered one of the prettiest lakes of Uttarakhand
 bharti ji ne bataaya ki agar ye chaal khaalen bani hoti to aaj helicopter se aag bujhane kii morrkhtaa nahin kerani padati
 That is why we are flying helicopters because we stopped making motion skins
 chennai isiilie to dub gaya kyonki hamane talabon ko bhar kar vahaan apartment bana diye
 Wherever we should be ashamed of our old antics, but our focus is on the pictures of the heroic heroic images
 isse aane vaali awaz hamaare bheetar romaanch paidaa karti he ki ham apane samay main prakruti kii har sharaarat par kaabo paa sakate hai
 The same helicopter was also flying in Chennai
 is helicopter ke udne kaa yahi matlab he ki hamane apni dharti jangal kaa itnaa nuksaan kar diya he ki ram bharose se pehle ab sena kaa hi bharosa he or sena ke jawan puri mustaidi se ye kaam karte bhi hai
 Lives of life
 aap dekhiye ki uttarakhand ke jangalon main lagi aag ko bujhane ke liye helicopter kahaan se pani bhar kar ud rahe hai
 The name of that place is Bhimtal
 yaheen se pani bharte hai or aag bujhaate hai
 If a sufficient number of tricks and skins had been made, it might not have happened
 chaal khaalon kaa zikr aapako hamaari sarkaron kii yojanaon main yaa to nahin milegaa yaa milegaa bhi to naam ke liye
 Now people do not even know about the chawls and not even the forest officials
 bihar main kosi main baadh ai thi
 Remember how many people drowned because they forgot to swim there
 jabaki kosi ke har kisse main naav or tairne waalon kaa zikr miltaa he
 Another Gandhian Anupam Mishra wrote that the sinking society is sinking
 chaal khaal kii tasviir bataa rahi he ki jal rahe hai jangal kyonki bhul gaya he uttarakhand aag bujhane kii apni hi tarkeeb
 When the forest panchayats were active, chal skins started being formed during the rainy days
 uttarakhand main faili aag ko samajhane ke liye aapako van panchayaton ke bare main samajhnaa hi padegaa
 You have already heard about gram panchayats
 van panchayaton ke bare main bhi suna hoga magar bhul gaye honge
 The government has forgotten and the forest officer too
 1931 main british sarkaar ne kumaun panchayat van niyam banaae
 The people of the mountains were given the responsibility of managing the forests
 kaha jaataa he ki uttarakhand main 12,600 van pachaanyate bani hai or inhen ek kanoon ke tahat adhikaar bhi diya gaya he
 The fact is that there is no trace of these Van Panchayats
 agar ye sakriy hoti to aaj aag bujhane ke liye helicopter se pani kii barsaat nahin kerani padati
 Army does not have to call
 pahaado main teen tarah kii zamin hoti he
 The government has a land
 inhen kwas van forest kehete hai yani jangle ke jangal
 The other land used to be called Civil Soyam Bhoomi
 is par gaanv kaa niyantran hota he lekin sarkaar bhi shaamil hoti he
 The government also helps in planting forest or fodder vegetation
 teesri bhoomi hoti he jo gaanv kii apni bhoomi hoti he
 People plant a forest on that land
 class van yani sarkari zamin chhod kar baaki zamin par van panchayaton kaa gathan hota he
 They do not have a budget, but from every family in the village, one person is a member of the Van Panchayat
 van panchayat main pachaas fisadi purush or pachaas fisadi mahilaon kaa hona anivaary he
 If the government had implemented its plans for forests through these forest panchayats, it would have continued to have a relationship between the forest officer, local departments and the common people through the forest panchayat
 van panchayatein disambar-janvari ke maheene se aag bujhane kii taiyaari kar leti thim jo ab nahin hoti he
 Until the people have the right over the forests, why would they consider the forest as their own
 kai baar kanoon se unhen vanchit kiya gaya he or kai baar kanoon ke naam par fansaa diye jane ke kaaran log in jangalon se jaivik sambandh nahin bana pate hai
 The forests are as alien to the people there as for you and us tourists
 aapako sochna to padegaa ki jo samaaj sadiyon se jangal ke saath ji rahaa he wo itnaa anjaan kaise ho gaya
 These distances are not today, we have also made these decades
 ek geet bhi he
 Yun Banja Burasan Rakha Jagwali, Yun's leaves mother milk, roots water
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki banj burans kii rakhwali isliye karo kyonki inaki jadon main pani he or pattiyon main doodh he
 Now we are bringing water from somewhere else
 angrezon ne apane samay main yatayaat ke maarg ke kinare fire line banani shuru kii
 Which are called fire protection bandage in Hindi
 yah ek tarah kaa gaddha hi hota tha jahaan pattiyon ko jamaa kar van vibhaag november-disambar main jala detaa tha
 Dry pine leaves were eliminated
 november-disambar kii nami main aag failati bhi nahin thi
 In summer, a stick spread
 kya pataa van vibhaag ke paas ab paryaapt karmchaaree bhi na ho
 Now all this will not work with the mobile app
 aadmi se hoga or aadmi kaa rishta samaaj or sarkaar se hoga tabhi hoga
 Fire safety straps are not even made in many places
 isse pataa chalata he ki van vibhaag jo abhi kaaphi kaam karata hua dikh rahaa he us vakt kahin or khoyaa hua tha
 People also used to pick leaves
 magar ab kanoon kaa dar sataata he
 Whatever assurance the government gives, they know that there will be such a clause which will be used
 sachchidanand bharti ne ek baat kahi
 Does not set fire
 aag to tili lagaati he
 Pine leaf is called Pirul
 ek jamaane main uttarakhand ke log is pirul se koyala bana lete the
 Now due to fear of law, we are unable to make coal
 pehle koyala banane ke liye chid kii pattiyon ko chun laate the
 The leaves were lit in a large box
 carbon baahar nikal jaataa tha or koyala bachaa rah jaataa tha
 If you do not associate the use of dry leaves with employment, then by applying how many employees, you will choose these leaves
 is buniyadi baat ko samajhenge to samasya kii jad pakad sakate hai
 Now this practice is over
 uttarakhand ke apper mukhya sachiv es ramasvami ne kaha ki 3 may ko aag lagane kii 121 ghatnaayen hui hai
 95 has been controlled
 is vakt sakriy aag kii sankhya 26 bataai ja rahi he
 The number was 40 on Monday
 ravivaar ko 70
 This indicates that large parts of the fire have been controlled
 iske liye rajya ke 11,160 karmchaariyon ko kaam main lagaaya gaya he
 People from national and state disaster management forces are also working
 emai-17 helicopter ne nainital or paudi main 16 udaanen bhari hai
 Four people have died and 16 are said to be injured
 abhi tak vanagni kii 1591 ghatnaayen darj ho chuki hai
 46 cases of willful fire have been registered
 vahi haal himachal pradesh kaa he
 In 8 of the 12 districts there, the forest cover has been spread
 ek maheene se soobe main aag kii ghatnaayen darj ho rahi hai
 The fire was also set last year
 har saal lagati he
 This time it is engaged on a much larger scale, but we are awake like it was the first time
 paryaavaran se lekar jangalon kaa jo nuksaan hua he uski bharpai itani aasaani or jaldi to nahin hone vaali
 By the way, we think that in this fire only forests are burnt, but it is not so, animals and birds also suffer terrible losses in this fire
 khaastaur par pakshiyon ke andey vagairah jal jate hai
 Reptiles, the animals of the reptile species, become the big prey of this, who are not able to get out of the fire in the forest, as well as many big animals do not survive this fire
 insaanon kii banaai sansthaaon ke alaava ek or zimmedaar he chid
 Many people said that the pineapple has spread due to pine
 dawanal jangalon kii aag ko kehete hai
 Did everything happen due to pine? kya ye khalanaayak hi he
 We are living in a time where information is coming and going at rocket speed
 aapane chid ke pedo ko dekha hoga
 Sighs will be filled
 inhen pedo se aag nikal rahi he
 Sushil Bahuguna has disseminated the available information about pine trees
 jo ham aapako yahaan bataanaa chaahate hai
 Pine is a coniferous tree
 isaki pattiyaan nukili hoti hai
 These trees range from eight hundred meters to 1800 meters in the mountains
 ek aam dharna he ki eucalyptus kii tarah chid ko bhi angrez europe se lekar aae, lekin aisa nahin he
 Pine tree has been found in the Himalayan hills for millions of years and has played a major role in creating the Himalayan forests
 tippaniyan Nature has been developed for places where there are steep slopes, rocky terrain, little or no soil layer, very little water, strong and direct sunlight
 aisi pahari dhalaanon ke liye chid ko prakruti ne taiyaar kiya tha, isiilie paristhitiki main santulan banaae rakhane ke liye chid kii bhi zarurat he
 Pine is also used commercially
 is ped kii lakdi makaan banane or duusare kaamon main istemaal hoti he
 Wood of some species of pine is also used in paper making
 isse nikalne vaala racin yani lisa bhi kai kaam aata he
 Its distillation produces turpentine oil
 sawaal ye he ki itane kaam kaa ped chid kyon pahaado ke jangalon main aag kii ek vajah ban rahaa he
 Actually, due to commercial reasons, there was large scale plantation of pine
 pehle plantesan ke saath-saath chid ko timber ke liye kaata bhi jaataa tha, lekin 1981 ke baad 1000 meter ke baad har tarah ke ped ke kaatane par roak lag gai
 Chir took the most advantage of it
 wo banj, burans or deodaar jaise mishrit vanaspati ke jangalon main bhi bas gaya
 Gradually the pine began to replace the trees of the rest of the species
 chid kii ek khaasiyat ye he ki wo apane aasapaas kisi duusari prajati ke ped ko panpane nahin detaa
 When the pine was not harvested in these forests, it started snatching the place of broad leaf forests
 nateeja ye hua ki chid kaa vistaar bahut bad gaya
 Due to this expansion, the fire in the forests also expanded because the pine tree spreads the fire in the forest rapidly
 chid kii pattiyaan jab suukh jaati hai to badi tezi se aag pakadati hai
 In summer, the pine leaves spread like a carpet in the forests, and a slight spark also spreads rapidly in the form of a large fire
 chid se nikalne vaala rezin jise lisa kehete hai wo bhi aag bhadakaane kaa kaam karata he
 These fires spread from pine forests burn other flora
 chid ke jangal pashu-pakshiyon ke bhi zyaada kaam nahin aate
 Pine leaves make pineic acid, which makes the soil acidic
 chid ke ped barish se mitti kaa kataav rokane main zyada sakasham nahin hote
 Water sources in the pine forests dry up, because moisture in the soil is unable to be retained
 lekin chid kaa ye vistaar insaani vajahon se hua, isliye chid ko jangal kaa villen kahana thik nahin hoga
 Where nothing else happens there is a pine and it makes a big forest
 hamane hi use un jagahon par panpane ke liye jagah di jo jagah uski nahin thi
 Bharti ji said that if these tricks were made of skins, it would not be foolish to extinguish fire with helicopters today
 isliye to ham helicopter uda rahe hai kyonki hamane chaal khaalon ko bananaa band kar diya
 That is why Chennai was drowned because we filled the ponds and built apartments there
 kahaan to hamen shame aani chahie apni puraani harkaton par, lekin hamaara dhyaan helicopter kii vir ras vaali tasveeron par hai
 The voice that comes from it creates a thrill in us that we can overcome every mischief of nature in our time
 chennai main bhi yahi helicopter ud rahaa tha
 This means that the helicopters are flying so much that we have done so much damage to the forest of our land that now before the Ram trusts, the army is now confident and the soldiers of the army do these tasks with complete efficiency
 jaan kii baazi laga dete hai
 See where the helicopters are flying with water to extinguish the fire in the forests of Uttarakhand
 us jagah kaa naam he bhimtal
 It is from here that we fill the water and extinguish the fire
 agar paryaapt sankhya main chaal or khaal bani hoti to shaayad ye naubat nahin aati
 You will not find any mention of trick skins in the schemes of our governments or even for the name
 ab logon ko bhi chaal khaal ke bare main pataa nahin he or van adhikariyon ko bhi nahin
 Kosi was flooded in Bihar
 yaad kiijie kitne log dub kar mar gaye isliye ki vahaan ke log tairnaa bhul gaye the
 Whereas in every story of Kosi, there is mention of boat and swimmers
 ek or gandhivadi anupam mishra ne likhaa tha ki dub rahaa he tairne vaala samaaj
 The picture of the trick skin is telling that the forests are burning because Uttarakhand has forgotten its own way to extinguish the fire
 van panchayatein jab sakriy hoti thi tab barish ke dinon main hi chaal khaalen banani shuru ho jaati thim
 To understand the fire spreading in Uttarakhand, you have to understand about the forest panchayats
 gram panchayaton ke bare main to aapane suna hi he
 You must have heard about forest panchayats but have forgotten
 sarkaar bhi bhul gai he or van adhikari bhi
 In 1931, the British Government made the Kumaon Panchayat Forest Rules
 pahaado ke logon ko wanon ke prabandhan kaa jimmaa diya gaya
 It is said that 12,600 forests are made in Uttarakhand and they are also empowered under a law
 asaliyat yah he ki in van panchayaton kaa koi ata pataa nahin he
 Had it been active, it would not have to rain water from helicopters to extinguish the fire today
 sena bulani nahin padati
 There are three types of land in the mountains
 ek zamin hoti he sarkaar kii
 These are called quas forest forests i
e
 jungle forest
 duusari zamin hoti jise civil soyam bhoomi kehete hai
 The village is controlled by this but the government is also involved
 jangal yaa chaare kii vanaspati lagane main sarkaar bhi madad karti he
 The third land is the village's own land
 us zamin par log jangal lagaate hai
 Forest Panchayats are formed on the remaining land leaving class one i
e
 government land
 inkaa koi bajet nahin hota magar gaanv ke har parivaar se ek vyakti van panchayat kaa sadsy hota he
 It is compulsory to have fifty percent males and fifty percent females in Van Panchayat
 agar sarkaar wanon ke liye apni yojanaon ko in van panchayaton ke zariye lagu karaati, sakriy rakhti to van adhikari, sthaneey vibhaagon or van panchayat ke zariye aam logon ke bich ek rishta jari rahata
 Van panchayats used to prepare to extinguish the fire from the month of december-january which is no longer there
 jab tak logon kaa jangalon par adhikaar nahin hoga tab tak ve jangal ko apana kyon samajhenge
 Many times they have been deprived of the law and many times people are not able to make biological connections to these forests due to being implicated in the name of law
 vahaan ke logon ke liye bhi jangal utane hi paraaye hai jitne aap or ham paryatakon ke liye
 You have to think how the society that has been living with the forest for centuries has become so unknown
 ye dooriyaan aaj kii nahin hai, ye bhi dashakon se hamane banaai hai
 There is also a song
 yun banja burasaan rakkha jagavaali, yun kaa pattiyon maa doodh, jadon maa pani
 This means guarding the oak burras because they have water in the roots and milk in the leaves
 ab ham pani kahin or se uda kar laa rahe hai
 In their time, the British started building fire lines along the road of traffic
 jinhen hindi main aag suraksha pattee kehete hai
 It used to be a kind of pit where the forest department used to collect leaves and burn them in november-december
 chid kii sukhi pattiyaan samaapt ho jaati thim
 The fire did not spread in the november-december humidity
 garmi main ek tili se fail gai
 Does the forest department not have sufficient staff now? ab ye sab kaam to mobile ap se nahin hoga
 Will be with man and man will be related to society and government only
 kai jagahon par aag suraksha pattiyaan banati bhi nahin hai
 This shows that the Forest Department, which is still doing a lot of work, was lost somewhere else at that time
 log bhi pattiyon ko chun laate the
 But now the law is afraid of sarkaar jitna bhi aashwaasan de unhen pataa he ki koi dhara aisi hogi jiskaa istemaal kar liya jayega
 Sachchidananda Bharati said one thing
 aag chid nahin lagaataa he
 The fire burns
 chid kii pattee ko pirul kehete hai
 Once upon a time, people of Uttarakhand used to make coal from this Pirul
 ab kanoon ke bhay ke kaaran koyala nahin bana pate
 Previously, they used to select pine leaves for making coal
 ek bade se dibbe main band kar pattiyon ko jalaayaa jaataa tha
 The carbon escaped and coal was left
 sookhe patton ke upyog ko rojgaar se nahin jodenge to kitne lakh karmchaaree lagaakar aap in patton ko chunavaayenge
 If you understand this basic thing, then you can get the root of the problem
 ab ye pratha khatm ho gai
 Uttarakhand Additional Chief Secretary s Ramaswamy said that there were 121 fire incidents on 3 May
 95 ko kaabo kar liya gaya he
 At present, the number of active fires is reported to be 26
 somvaar ko yah sankhya 40 thi
 70 on Sunday
 isse sanket mil rahaa he ki aag ke bade hisse par niyantran paa liya gaya he
 For this, 11,160 employees of the state have been employed
 rashtriya or rajya aapadaa prabandhan bal ke log bhi kaam main jute hai
 The Mi-17 helicopter has taken 16 flights to Nainital and Pauri
 chaar logon kii maut ho chuki he or 16 ghayal bataaye ja rahe hai
 So far, 1591 incidents of Vanagni have been reported
 jaanboojh kar aag lagane ke 46 maamle darj kiye gaye hai
 The same situation is in Himachal Pradesh
 vahaan ke 12 main se 8 zilon main dawanal fail chukaa he
 Fire incidents have been reported in the state since a month
 aag pichley saal bhi lagi thi
 It takes place every year
 is baar zyada bade paimaane par lagi he lekin ham aise jaage hai jaise pehali baar lagi ho
 The damage that has been done to the forests from the environment is not going to be compensated so easily and quickly
 vaise ham sochate hai ki is aag main sirf jangal jalte hai lekin aisa nahin he, pashu-pakshiyon kaa bhi is aag main bhayanak nuksaan hota he jo jangal kii aag main ghir jate hai
 Especially the eggs of birds, etc
 are burnt
 reptiles yani sarisrup prajati ke jaanavar iskaa bada shikaar banate hai jo jangal main aag kii se baahar nahin nikal pate, saath hi kai bade jaanavar bhi is aag se batch nahin pate
 Apart from the institutions made by humans, another responsible is the pine
 kai logon ne kaha ki chid ke kaaran dawanal failaa he
 The forest fire is called forest fire
 kya chid ke kaaran hi sab kuch hua
 Is this the villain? ham ek aise samay main rah rahe hai jahaan suchanaaen rocket kii raftaar se aa rahi hai or chali ja rahi hai
 You must have seen pine trees
 aahen bhari hongi
 Fire is coming out from these trees
 susheel bahuguna ne chid ke pedo ke bare main uplabdh jaankariyon kii cheerfaad kii he
 What we want to tell you here
 chid ek conipheras yani shankudhari ped he
 Its leaves are pointed
 pahaado main ye ped aath sau meter se 1800 meter kii oonchai tak hota he
 There is a general belief that, like Eucalyptus, the British brought the pine from Europe, but it is not so
 chid kaa ped karodon saal se himalay ke pahari ilaakon main paaya jaataa he or himalay ke jangalon ko banane main isaki ek badi bhoomika rahi he
 The comments chid ko kudarat ne darasal aisi jagahon ke liye viksit kiya jahaan tikhi dhalaan hon, chattani ilaaka ho, mitti kii parat bahut kam ho yaa naa ke baraabar ho, pani bahut kam ho, tej or sidhi dhoop aati ho
 Pine was prepared by nature for such mountain slopes, therefore pine is also needed to maintain balance in the ecology
 chid kaa vyavsaayik istemaal bhi khub hota he
 The wood of this tree is used in building houses and other works
 chid kii kuch prajatiyon kii lakdi kaagaz banane ke kaam bhi aati he
 The resin that comes out of it is also useful
 isiike distilation se tarapentine oil banataa he
 The question is why the pine tree is becoming a cause of fire in the jungles of the mountains
 darasal vyavsaayik kaarnon se chid kaa bade paimaane par plantesan hua
 Earlier, along with the plantation, the pine was harvested for timber, but after 1981 the cutting of all kinds of trees was stopped after 1000 meters
 iskaa sabase zyaada faaydaa chid ne uthaaya
 He also settled in forests of mixed vegetation like banj, burras and cedars
 dhire-dhire chid ne baaki prajatiyon ke pedo kii jagah lenaa shuru kar diya
 One peculiarity of pine is that it does not allow any other species of tree to grow around it
 chid ko jab in jangalon main kaata nahin gaya to usne chaudee pattee ke jangalon kii jagah chhinani shuru kar di
 The result was that the expansion of the pine greatly increased
 is vistaar kii vajah se jangalon main aag kaa bhi vistaar hua kyonki chid kaa ped jangal main aag ko tezi se failaata he
 When the pine leaves dry, they catch fire very quickly
 garmiyon main chid kii pattiyaan jangalon main ek carpet kii tarah fail jaati hai or ek halki si chingaari bhi badi aag kii shakl main tezi se failane lagati he
 The resin from the pine which is called LISA also acts as a fire
 chid ke jangalon se faili ye aag duusari vanaspatiyon ko jala detii he
 Pine forests do not work much for animals and birds either
 chid kii pattiyaan pinic acid banaati hai jisase mitti acidic ho jaati he
 Pine trees are not much capable of preventing soil erosion from rain
 chid ke jangalon main jal strot suukh jate hai, kyonki mitti main nami qaayam nahin rah paati
 But this expansion of pine was due to human reasons, so it would not be right to call pine as the villain of the forest
 jahaan kuch or nahin hota vahaan chid hota he or wo bada jangal banaata he
 We gave him a place to grow in places that were not his
 chaal khaalon kaa zikr aapako hamaari sarkaron kii yojanaon main yaa to nahin milegaa yaa milegaa bhi to naam ke liye
 Now people do not even know about the chawls and not even the forest officials
 bihar main kosi main baadh ai thi
 Remember how many people drowned because they forgot to swim there
 jabaki kosi ke har kisse main naav or tairne waalon kaa zikr miltaa he
 Another Gandhian Anupam Mishra wrote that the sinking society is sinking
 chaal khaal kii tasviir bataa rahi he ki jal rahe hai jangal kyonki bhul gaya he uttarakhand aag bujhane kii apni hi tarkeeb
 When the forest panchayats were active, chal skins started being formed during the rainy days
 uttarakhand main faili aag ko samajhane ke liye aapako van panchayaton ke bare main samajhnaa hi padegaa
 You have already heard about gram panchayats
 van panchayaton ke bare main bhi suna hoga magar bhul gaye honge
 The government has forgotten and the forest officer too
 1931 main british sarkaar ne kumaun panchayat van niyam banaae
 The people of the mountains were given the responsibility of managing the forests
 kaha jaataa he ki uttarakhand main 12,600 van pachaanyate bani hai or inhen ek kanoon ke tahat adhikaar bhi diya gaya he
 The fact is that there is no trace of these Van Panchayats
 agar ye sakriy hoti to aaj aag bujhane ke liye helicopter se pani kii barsaat nahin kerani padati
 Army does not have to call
 pahaado main teen tarah kii zamin hoti he
 The government has a land
 inhen kwas van forest kehete hai yani jangle ke jangal
 The other land used to be called Civil Soyam Bhoomi
 is par gaanv kaa niyantran hota he lekin sarkaar bhi shaamil hoti he
 The government also helps in planting forest or fodder vegetation
 teesri bhoomi hoti he jo gaanv kii apni bhoomi hoti he
 People plant a forest on that land
 class van yani sarkari zamin chhod kar baaki zamin par van panchayaton kaa gathan hota he
 They do not have a budget, but from every family in the village, one person is a member of the Van Panchayat
 van panchayat main pachaas fisadi purush or pachaas fisadi mahilaon kaa hona anivaary he
 If the government had implemented its plans for forests through these forest panchayats, it would have continued to have a relationship between the forest officer, local departments and the common people through the forest panchayat
 van panchayatein disambar-janvari ke maheene se aag bujhane kii taiyaari kar leti thim jo ab nahin hoti he
 Until the people have the right over the forests, why would they consider the forest as their own
 kai baar kanoon se unhen vanchit kiya gaya he or kai baar kanoon ke naam par fansaa diye jane ke kaaran log in jangalon se jaivik sambandh nahin bana pate hai
 The forests are as alien to the people there as for you and us tourists
 aapako sochna to padegaa ki jo samaaj sadiyon se jangal ke saath ji rahaa he wo itnaa anjaan kaise ho gaya
 These distances are not today, we have also made these decades
 ek geet bhi he
 Yun Banja Burasan Rakha Jagwali, Yun's leaves mother milk, roots water
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki banj burans kii rakhwali isliye karo kyonki inaki jadon main pani he or pattiyon main doodh he
 Now we are bringing water from somewhere else
 angrezon ne apane samay main yatayaat ke maarg ke kinare fire line banani shuru kii
 Which are called fire protection bandage in Hindi
 yah ek tarah kaa gaddha hi hota tha jahaan pattiyon ko jamaa kar van vibhaag november-disambar main jala detaa tha
 Dry pine leaves were eliminated
 november-disambar kii nami main aag failati bhi nahin thi
 In summer, a stick spread
 kya pataa van vibhaag ke paas ab paryaapt karmchaaree bhi na ho
 Now all this will not work with the mobile app
 aadmi se hoga or aadmi kaa rishta samaaj or sarkaar se hoga tabhi hoga
 Fire safety straps are not even made in many places
 isse pataa chalata he ki van vibhaag jo abhi kaaphi kaam karata hua dikh rahaa he us vakt kahin or khoyaa hua tha
 People also used to pick leaves
 magar ab kanoon kaa dar sataata he
 Whatever assurance the government gives, they know that there will be such a clause which will be used
 sachchidanand bharti ne ek baat kahi
 Does not set fire
 aag to tili lagaati he
 Pine leaf is called Pirul
 ek jamaane main uttarakhand ke log is pirul se koyala bana lete the
 Now due to fear of law, we are unable to make coal
 pehle koyala banane ke liye chid kii pattiyon ko chun laate the
 The leaves were lit in a large box
 carbon baahar nikal jaataa tha or koyala bachaa rah jaataa tha
 If you do not associate the use of dry leaves with employment, then by applying how many employees, you will choose these leaves
 is buniyadi baat ko samajhenge to samasya kii jad pakad sakate hai
 Now this practice is over
 uttarakhand ke apper mukhya sachiv es ramasvami ne kaha ki 3 may ko aag lagane kii 121 ghatnaayen hui hai
 95 has been controlled
 is vakt sakriy aag kii sankhya 26 bataai ja rahi he
 The number was 40 on Monday
 ravivaar ko 70
 This indicates that large parts of the fire have been controlled
 iske liye rajya ke 11,160 karmchaariyon ko kaam main lagaaya gaya he
 People from national and state disaster management forces are also working
 emai-17 helicopter ne nainital or paudi main 16 udaanen bhari hai
 Four people have died and 16 are said to be injured
 abhi tak vanagni kii 1591 ghatnaayen darj ho chuki hai
 46 cases of willful fire have been registered
 vahi haal himachal pradesh kaa he
 In 8 of the 12 districts there, the forest cover has been spread
 ek maheene se soobe main aag kii ghatnaayen darj ho rahi hai
 The fire was also set last year
 har saal lagati he
 This time it is engaged on a much larger scale, but we are awake like it was the first time
 paryaavaran se lekar jangalon kaa jo nuksaan hua he uski bharpai itani aasaani or jaldi to nahin hone vaali
 By the way, we think that only the forests are burnt in this fire, but it is not so, the animals and birds also suffer terrible losses in this fire which gets trapped in the forest fire 
 khaastaur par pakshiyon ke andey vagairah jal jate hai
 Reptiles, the animals of the reptile species, become the big prey of this, who are not able to get out of the fire in the forest, as well as many big animals do not survive this fire
 insaanon kii banaai sansthaaon ke alaava ek or zimmedaar he chid
 Many people said that the pineapple has spread due to pine
 dawanal jangalon kii aag ko kehete hai
 Did everything happen due to pine? kya ye khalanaayak hi he
 We are living in a time where information is coming and going at rocket speed
 aapane chid ke pedo ko dekha hoga
 Sighs will be filled
 inhen pedo se aag nikal rahi he
 Sushil Bahuguna has disseminated the available information about pine trees
 jo ham aapako yahaan bataanaa chaahate hai
 Pine is a coniferous tree
 isaki pattiyaan nukili hoti hai
 These trees range from eight hundred meters to 1800 meters in the mountains
 ek aam dharna he ki eucalyptus kii tarah chid ko bhi angrez europe se lekar aae, lekin aisa nahin he
 Pine tree has been found in the Himalayan hills for millions of years and has played a major role in creating the Himalayan forests
 tippaniyan Nature has been developed for places where there are steep slopes, rocky terrain, little or no soil layer, very little water, strong and direct sunlight
 aisi pahari dhalaanon ke liye chid ko prakruti ne taiyaar kiya tha, isiilie paristhitiki main santulan banaae rakhane ke liye chid kii bhi zarurat he
 Pine is also used commercially
 is ped kii lakdi makaan banane or duusare kaamon main istemaal hoti he
 Wood of some species of pine is also used in paper making
 isse nikalne vaala racin yani lisa bhi kai kaam aata he
 Its distillation produces turpentine oil
 sawaal ye he ki itane kaam kaa ped chid kyon pahaado ke jangalon main aag kii ek vajah ban rahaa he
 Actually, due to commercial reasons, there was large scale plantation of pine
 pehle plantesan ke saath-saath chid ko timber ke liye kaata bhi jaataa tha, lekin 1981 ke baad 1000 meter ke baad har tarah ke ped ke kaatane par roak lag gai
 Chir took the most advantage of it
 wo banj, burans or deodaar jaise mishrit vanaspati ke jangalon main bhi bas gaya
 Gradually the pine began to replace the trees of the rest of the species
 chid kii ek khaasiyat ye he ki wo apane aasapaas kisi duusari prajati ke ped ko panpane nahin detaa
 When the pine was not harvested in these forests, it started snatching the place of broad leaf forests
 nateeja ye hua ki chid kaa vistaar bahut bad gaya
 Due to this expansion, the fire in the forests also expanded because the pine tree spreads the fire in the forest rapidly
 chid kii pattiyaan jab suukh jaati hai to badi tezi se aag pakadati hai
 In summer, the pine leaves spread like a carpet in the forests, and a slight spark also spreads rapidly in the form of a large fire
 chid se nikalne vaala rezin jise lisa kehete hai wo bhi aag bhadakaane kaa kaam karata he
 These fires spread from pine forests burn other flora
 chid ke jangal pashu-pakshiyon ke bhi zyaada kaam nahin aate
 Pine leaves make pineic acid, which makes the soil acidic
 chid ke ped barish se mitti kaa kataav rokane main zyada sakasham nahin hote
 Water sources in the pine forests dry up, because moisture in the soil is unable to be retained
 lekin chid kaa ye vistaar insaani vajahon se hua, isliye chid ko jangal kaa villen kahana thik nahin hoga
 Where nothing else happens there is a pine and it makes a big forest
 hamane hi use un jagahon par panpane ke liye jagah di jo jagah uski nahin thi
 You have already heard about gram panchayats
 van panchayaton ke bare main bhi suna hoga magar bhul gaye honge
 The government has forgotten and the forest officer too
 1931 main british sarkaar ne kumaun panchayat van niyam banaae
 The people of the mountains were given the responsibility of managing the forests
 kaha jaataa he ki uttarakhand main 12,600 van pachaanyate bani hai or inhen ek kanoon ke tahat adhikaar bhi diya gaya he
 The fact is that there is no trace of these Van Panchayats
 agar ye sakriy hoti to aaj aag bujhane ke liye helicopter se pani kii barsaat nahin kerani padati
 Army does not have to call
 pahaado main teen tarah kii zamin hoti he
 The government has a land
 inhen kwas van forest kehete hai yani jangle ke jangal
 The other land used to be called Civil Soyam Bhoomi
 is par gaanv kaa niyantran hota he lekin sarkaar bhi shaamil hoti he
 The government also helps in planting forest or fodder vegetation
 teesri bhoomi hoti he jo gaanv kii apni bhoomi hoti he
 People plant a forest on that land
 class van yani sarkari zamin chhod kar baaki zamin par van panchayaton kaa gathan hota he
 They do not have a budget, but from every family in the village, one person is a member of the Van Panchayat
 van panchayat main pachaas fisadi purush or pachaas fisadi mahilaon kaa hona anivaary he
 If the government had implemented its plans for forests through these forest panchayats, it would have continued to have a relationship between the forest officer, local departments and the common people through the forest panchayat
 van panchayatein disambar-janvari ke maheene se aag bujhane kii taiyaari kar leti thim jo ab nahin hoti he
 Until the people have the right over the forests, why would they consider the forest as their own
 kai baar kanoon se unhen vanchit kiya gaya he or kai baar kanoon ke naam par fansaa diye jane ke kaaran log in jangalon se jaivik sambandh nahin bana pate hai
 The forests are as alien to the people there as for you and us tourists
 aapako sochna to padegaa ki jo samaaj sadiyon se jangal ke saath ji rahaa he wo itnaa anjaan kaise ho gaya
 These distances are not today, we have also made these decades
 ek geet bhi he
 Yun Banja Burasan Rakha Jagwali, Yun's leaves mother milk, roots water
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki banj burans kii rakhwali isliye karo kyonki inaki jadon main pani he or pattiyon main doodh he
 Now we are bringing water from somewhere else
 angrezon ne apane samay main yatayaat ke maarg ke kinare fire line banani shuru kii
 Which are called fire protection bandage in Hindi
 yah ek tarah kaa gaddha hi hota tha jahaan pattiyon ko jamaa kar van vibhaag november-disambar main jala detaa tha
 Dry pine leaves were eliminated
 november-disambar kii nami main aag failati bhi nahin thi
 In summer, a stick spread
 kya pataa van vibhaag ke paas ab paryaapt karmchaaree bhi na ho
 Now all this will not work with the mobile app
 aadmi se hoga or aadmi kaa rishta samaaj or sarkaar se hoga tabhi hoga
 Fire safety straps are not even made in many places
 isse pataa chalata he ki van vibhaag jo abhi kaaphi kaam karata hua dikh rahaa he us vakt kahin or khoyaa hua tha
 People also used to pick leaves
 magar ab kanoon kaa dar sataata he
 Whatever assurance the government gives, they know that there will be such a clause which will be used
 sachchidanand bharti ne ek baat kahi
 Does not set fire
 aag to tili lagaati he
 Pine leaf is called Pirul
 ek jamaane main uttarakhand ke log is pirul se koyala bana lete the
 Now due to fear of law, we are unable to make coal
 pehle koyala banane ke liye chid kii pattiyon ko chun laate the
 The leaves were lit in a large box
 carbon baahar nikal jaataa tha or koyala bachaa rah jaataa tha
 If you do not associate the use of dry leaves with employment, then by applying how many employees, you will choose these leaves
 is buniyadi baat ko samajhenge to samasya kii jad pakad sakate hai

 jinhen hindi main aag suraksha pattee kehete hai
 It used to be a kind of pit where the forest department used to collect leaves and burn them in november-december
 chid kii sukhi pattiyaan samaapt ho jaati thim
 The fire did not spread in the november-december humidity
 garmi main ek tili se fail gai
 Does the forest department not have sufficient staff now? ab ye sab kaam to mobile ap se nahin hoga
 Will be with man and man will be related to society and government only
 kai jagahon par aag suraksha pattiyaan banati bhi nahin hai
 This shows that the Forest Department, which is still doing a lot of work, was lost somewhere else at that time
 log bhi pattiyon ko chun laate the
 But now the law is afraid of sarkaar jitna bhi aashwaasan de unhen pataa he ki koi dhara aisi hogi jiskaa istemaal kar liya jayega
 Sachchidananda Bharati said one thing
 aag chid nahin lagaataa he
 The fire burns
 chid kii pattee ko pirul kehete hai
 Once upon a time, people of Uttarakhand used to make coal from this Pirul
 ab kanoon ke bhay ke kaaran koyala nahin bana pate
 Previously, they used to select pine leaves for making coal
 ek bade se dibbe main band kar pattiyon ko jalaayaa jaataa tha
 The carbon escaped and coal was left
 sookhe patton ke upyog ko rojgaar se nahin jodenge to kitne lakh karmchaaree lagaakar aap in patton ko chunavaayenge
 If you understand this basic thing, then you can get the root of the problem
 ab ye pratha khatm ho gai
 Uttarakhand Additional Chief Secretary s Ramaswamy said that there were 121 fire incidents on 3 May
 95 ko kaabo kar liya gaya he
 At present, the number of active fires is reported to be 26
 somvaar ko yah sankhya 40 thi
 70 on Sunday
 isse sanket mil rahaa he ki aag ke bade hisse par niyantran paa liya gaya he
 For this, 11,160 employees of the state have been employed
 rashtriya or rajya aapadaa prabandhan bal ke log bhi kaam main jute hai
 The Mi-17 helicopter has taken 16 flights to Nainital and Pauri
 chaar logon kii maut ho chuki he or 16 ghayal bataaye ja rahe hai
 So far, 1591 incidents of Vanagni have been reported
 jaanboojh kar aag lagane ke 46 maamle darj kiye gaye hai
 The same situation is in Himachal Pradesh
 vahaan ke 12 main se 8 zilon main dawanal fail chukaa he
 Fire incidents have been reported in the state since a month
 aag pichley saal bhi lagi thi
 It takes place every year
 is baar zyada bade paimaane par lagi he lekin ham aise jaage hai jaise pehali baar lagi ho
 The damage that has been done to the forests from the environment is not going to be compensated so easily and quickly
 vaise ham sochate hai ki is aag main sirf jangal jalte hai lekin aisa nahin he, pashu-pakshiyon kaa bhi is aag main bhayanak nuksaan hota he jo jangal kii aag main ghir jate hai
 Especially the eggs of birds, etc
 are burnt
 reptiles yani sarisrup prajati ke jaanavar iskaa bada shikaar banate hai jo jangal main aag kii se baahar nahin nikal pate, saath hi kai bade jaanavar bhi is aag se batch nahin pate
 Apart from the institutions made by humans, another responsible is the pine
 kai logon ne kaha ki chid ke kaaran dawanal failaa he
 The forest fire is called forest fire
 kya chid ke kaaran hi sab kuch hua
 Is this the villain? ham ek aise samay main rah rahe hai jahaan suchanaaen rocket kii raftaar se aa rahi hai or chali ja rahi hai
 You must have seen pine trees
 aahen bhari hongi
 Fire is coming out from these trees
 susheel bahuguna ne chid ke pedo ke bare main uplabdh jaankariyon kii cheerfaad kii he
 What we want to tell you here
 chid ek conipheras yani shankudhari ped he
 Its leaves are pointed
 pahaado main ye ped aath sau meter se 1800 meter kii oonchai tak hota he
 There is a general belief that, like Eucalyptus, the British brought the pine from Europe, but it is not so
 chid kaa ped karodon saal se himalay ke pahari ilaakon main paaya jaataa he or himalay ke jangalon ko banane main isaki ek badi bhoomika rahi he
 The comments chid ko kudarat ne darasal aisi jagahon ke liye viksit kiya jahaan tikhi dhalaan hon, chattani ilaaka ho, mitti kii parat bahut kam ho yaa naa ke baraabar ho, pani bahut kam ho, tej or sidhi dhoop aati ho
 Pine was prepared by nature for such mountain slopes, therefore pine is also needed to maintain balance in the ecology
 chid kaa vyavsaayik istemaal bhi khub hota he
 The wood of this tree is used in building houses and other works
 chid kii kuch prajatiyon kii lakdi kaagaz banane ke kaam bhi aati he
 The resin that comes out of it is also useful
 isiike distilation se tarapentine oil banataa he
 The question is why the pine tree is becoming a cause of fire in the jungles of the mountains
 darasal vyavsaayik kaarnon se chid kaa bade paimaane par plantesan hua
 Earlier, along with the plantation, the pine was harvested for timber, but after 1981 the cutting of all kinds of trees was stopped after 1000 meters
 iskaa sabase zyaada faaydaa chid ne uthaaya
 He also settled in forests of mixed vegetation like banj, burras and cedars
 dhire-dhire chid ne baaki prajatiyon ke pedo kii jagah lenaa shuru kar diya
 One peculiarity of pine is that it does not allow any other species of tree to grow around it
 chid ko jab in jangalon main kaata nahin gaya to usne chaudee pattee ke jangalon kii jagah chhinani shuru kar di
 The result was that the expansion of the pine greatly increased
 is vistaar kii vajah se jangalon main aag kaa bhi vistaar hua kyonki chid kaa ped jangal main aag ko tezi se failaata he
 When the pine leaves dry, they catch fire very quickly
 garmiyon main chid kii pattiyaan jangalon main ek carpet kii tarah fail jaati hai or ek halki si chingaari bhi badi aag kii shakl main tezi se failane lagati he
 The resin from the pine which is called LISA also acts as a fire
 chid ke jangalon se faili ye aag duusari vanaspatiyon ko jala detii he
 Pine forests do not work much for animals and birds either
 chid kii pattiyaan pinic acid banaati hai jisase mitti acidic ho jaati he
 Pine trees are not much capable of preventing soil erosion from rain
 chid ke jangalon main jal strot suukh jate hai, kyonki mitti main nami qaayam nahin rah paati
 But this expansion of pine was due to human reasons, so it would not be right to call pine as the villain of the forest
 jahaan kuch or nahin hota vahaan chid hota he or wo bada jangal banaata he
 We gave him a place to grow in places that were not his
 log bhi pattiyon ko chun laate the
 But now the law is afraid of sarkaar jitna bhi aashwaasan de unhen pataa he ki koi dhara aisi hogi jiskaa istemaal kar liya jayega
 Sachchidananda Bharati said one thing
 aag chid nahin lagaataa he
 The fire burns
 chid kii pattee ko pirul kehete hai
 Once upon a time, people of Uttarakhand used to make coal from this Pirul
 ab kanoon ke bhay ke kaaran koyala nahin bana pate

 ab ye pratha khatm ho gai
 Uttarakhand Additional Chief Secretary s Ramaswamy said that there were 121 fire incidents on 3 May
 95 ko kaabo kar liya gaya he
 At present, the number of active fires is reported to be 26
 somvaar ko yah sankhya 40 thi
 70 on Sunday
 isse sanket mil rahaa he ki aag ke bade hisse par niyantran paa liya gaya he
 For this, 11,160 employees of the state have been employed
 rashtriya or rajya aapadaa prabandhan bal ke log bhi kaam main jute hai
 The Mi-17 helicopter has taken 16 flights to Nainital and Pauri
 chaar logon kii maut ho chuki he or 16 ghayal bataaye ja rahe hai
 So far, 1591 incidents of Vanagni have been reported
 jaanboojh kar aag lagane ke 46 maamle darj kiye gaye hai
 The same situation is in Himachal Pradesh
 vahaan ke 12 main se 8 zilon main dawanal fail chukaa he
 Fire incidents have been reported in the state since a month
 aag pichley saal bhi lagi thi
 It takes place every year
 is baar zyada bade paimaane par lagi he lekin ham aise jaage hai jaise pehali baar lagi ho
 The damage that has been done to the forests from the environment is not going to be compensated so easily and quickly
 vaise ham sochate hai ki is aag main sirf jangal jalte hai lekin aisa nahin he, pashu-pakshiyon kaa bhi is aag main bhayanak nuksaan hota he jo jangal kii aag main ghir jate hai
 Especially the eggs of birds, etc
 are burnt
 reptiles yani sarisrup prajati ke jaanavar iskaa bada shikaar banate hai jo jangal main aag kii se baahar nahin nikal pate, saath hi kai bade jaanavar bhi is aag se batch nahin pate
 Apart from the institutions made by humans, another responsible is the pine
 kai logon ne kaha ki chid ke kaaran dawanal failaa he
 The forest fire is called forest fire
 kya chid ke kaaran hi sab kuch hua
 Is this the villain? ham ek aise samay main rah rahe hai jahaan suchanaaen rocket kii raftaar se aa rahi hai or chali ja rahi hai
 You must have seen pine trees
 aahen bhari hongi
 Fire is coming out from these trees
 susheel bahuguna ne chid ke pedo ke bare main uplabdh jaankariyon kii cheerfaad kii he
 What we want to tell you here
 chid ek conipheras yani shankudhari ped he
 Its leaves are pointed
 pahaado main ye ped aath sau meter se 1800 meter kii oonchai tak hota he
 There is a general belief that, like Eucalyptus, the British brought the pine from Europe, but it is not so
 chid kaa ped karodon saal se himalay ke pahari ilaakon main paaya jaataa he or himalay ke jangalon ko banane main isaki ek badi bhoomika rahi he
 The comments chid ko kudarat ne darasal aisi jagahon ke liye viksit kiya jahaan tikhi dhalaan hon, chattani ilaaka ho, mitti kii parat bahut kam ho yaa naa ke baraabar ho, pani bahut kam ho, tej or sidhi dhoop aati ho
 Pine was prepared by nature for such mountain slopes, therefore pine is also needed to maintain balance in the ecology
 chid kaa vyavsaayik istemaal bhi khub hota he
 The wood of this tree is used in building houses and other works
 chid kii kuch prajatiyon kii lakdi kaagaz banane ke kaam bhi aati he
 The resin that comes out of it is also useful
 isiike distilation se tarapentine oil banataa he
 The question is why the pine tree is becoming a cause of fire in the jungles of the mountains
 darasal vyavsaayik kaarnon se chid kaa bade paimaane par plantesan hua
 Earlier, along with the plantation, the pine was harvested for timber, but after 1981 the cutting of all kinds of trees was stopped after 1000 meters
 iskaa sabase zyaada faaydaa chid ne uthaaya
 He also settled in forests of mixed vegetation like banj, burras and cedars
 dhire-dhire chid ne baaki prajatiyon ke pedo kii jagah lenaa shuru kar diya
 One peculiarity of pine is that it does not allow any other species of tree to grow around it
 chid ko jab in jangalon main kaata nahin gaya to usne chaudee pattee ke jangalon kii jagah chhinani shuru kar di
 The result was that the expansion of the pine greatly increased
 is vistaar kii vajah se jangalon main aag kaa bhi vistaar hua kyonki chid kaa ped jangal main aag ko tezi se failaata he
 When the pine leaves dry, they catch fire very quickly
 garmiyon main chid kii pattiyaan jangalon main ek carpet kii tarah fail jaati hai or ek halki si chingaari bhi badi aag kii shakl main tezi se failane lagati he
 The resin from the pine which is called LISA also acts as a fire
 chid ke jangalon se faili ye aag duusari vanaspatiyon ko jala detii he
 Pine forests do not work much for animals and birds either
 chid kii pattiyaan pinic acid banaati hai jisase mitti acidic ho jaati he
 Pine trees are not much capable of preventing soil erosion from rain
 chid ke jangalon main jal strot suukh jate hai, kyonki mitti main nami qaayam nahin rah paati
 But this expansion of pine was due to human reasons, so it would not be right to call pine as the villain of the forest
 jahaan kuch or nahin hota vahaan chid hota he or wo bada jangal banaata he
 We gave him a place to grow in places that were not his
 uttarakhand ke apper mukhya sachiv es ramasvami ne kaha ki 3 may ko aag lagane kii 121 ghatnaayen hui hai
 95 has been controlled
 is vakt sakriy aag kii sankhya 26 bataai ja rahi he
 The number was 40 on Monday
 ravivaar ko 70
 This indicates that large parts of the fire have been controlled
 iske liye rajya ke 11,160 karmchaariyon ko kaam main lagaaya gaya he
 People from national and state disaster management forces are also working
 emai-17 helicopter ne nainital or paudi main 16 udaanen bhari hai
 Four people have died and 16 are said to be injured
 abhi tak vanagni kii 1591 ghatnaayen darj ho chuki hai
 46 cases of willful fire have been registered
 vahi haal himachal pradesh kaa he
 In 8 of the 12 districts there, the forest cover has been spread
 ek maheene se soobe main aag kii ghatnaayen darj ho rahi hai
 The fire was also set last year
 har saal lagati he
 This time it is engaged on a much larger scale, but we are awake like it was the first time
 paryaavaran se lekar jangalon kaa jo nuksaan hua he uski bharpai itani aasaani or jaldi to nahin hone vaali
 By the way, we think that in this fire only forests are burnt, but it is not so, animals and birds also suffer terrible losses in this fire
 khaastaur par pakshiyon ke andey vagairah jal jate hai
 Reptiles, the animals of the reptile species, become the big prey of this, who are not able to get out of the fire in the forest, as well as many big animals do not survive this fire
 insaanon kii banaai sansthaaon ke alaava ek or zimmedaar he chid
 Many people said that the pineapple has spread due to pine
 dawanal jangalon kii aag ko kehete hai
 Did everything happen due to pine? kya ye khalanaayak hi he
 We are living in a time where information is coming and going at rocket speed
 aapane chid ke pedo ko dekha hoga
 Sighs will be filled
 inhen pedo se aag nikal rahi he
 Sushil Bahuguna has disseminated the available information about pine trees
 jo ham aapako yahaan bataanaa chaahate hai
 Pine is a coniferous tree
 isaki pattiyaan nukili hoti hai
 These trees range from eight hundred meters to 1800 meters in the mountains
 ek aam dharna he ki eucalyptus kii tarah chid ko bhi angrez europe se lekar aae, lekin aisa nahin he
 Pine tree has been found in the Himalayan hills for millions of years and has played a major role in creating the Himalayan forests
 tippaniyan Nature has been developed for places where there are steep slopes, rocky terrain, little or no soil layer, very little water, strong and direct sunlight
 aisi pahari dhalaanon ke liye chid ko prakruti ne taiyaar kiya tha, isiilie paristhitiki main santulan banaae rakhane ke liye chid kii bhi zarurat he
 Pine is also used commercially
 is ped kii lakdi makaan banane or duusare kaamon main istemaal hoti he
 Wood of some species of pine is also used in paper making
 isse nikalne vaala racin yani lisa bhi kai kaam aata he
 Its distillation produces turpentine oil
 sawaal ye he ki itane kaam kaa ped chid kyon pahaado ke jangalon main aag kii ek vajah ban rahaa he
 Actually, due to commercial reasons, there was large scale plantation of pine
 pehle plantesan ke saath-saath chid ko timber ke liye kaata bhi jaataa tha, lekin 1981 ke baad 1000 meter ke baad har tarah ke ped ke kaatane par roak lag gai
 Chir took the most advantage of it
 wo banj, burans or deodaar jaise mishrit vanaspati ke jangalon main bhi bas gaya
 Gradually the pine began to replace the trees of the rest of the species
 chid kii ek khaasiyat ye he ki wo apane aasapaas kisi duusari prajati ke ped ko panpane nahin detaa
 When the pine was not harvested in these forests, it started snatching the place of broad leaf forests
 nateeja ye hua ki chid kaa vistaar bahut bad gaya
 Due to this expansion, the fire in the forests also expanded because the pine tree spreads the fire in the forest rapidly
 chid kii pattiyaan jab suukh jaati hai to badi tezi se aag pakadati hai
 In summer, the pine leaves spread like a carpet in the forests, and a slight spark also spreads rapidly in the form of a large fire
 chid se nikalne vaala rezin jise lisa kehete hai wo bhi aag bhadakaane kaa kaam karata he
 These fires spread from pine forests burn other flora
 chid ke jangal pashu-pakshiyon ke bhi zyaada kaam nahin aate
 Pine leaves make pineic acid, which makes the soil acidic
 chid ke ped barish se mitti kaa kataav rokane main zyada sakasham nahin hote
 Water sources in the pine forests dry up, because moisture in the soil is unable to be retained
 lekin chid kaa ye vistaar insaani vajahon se hua, isliye chid ko jangal kaa villen kahana thik nahin hoga
 Where nothing else happens there is a pine and it makes a big forest
 hamane hi use un jagahon par panpane ke liye jagah di jo jagah uski nahin thi
 By the way, we think that in this fire only forests are burnt, but it is not so, animals and birds also suffer terrible losses in this fire

 bharat or australia ke khele gaye mukaable ko chaar din ho gaye hai lekin yah match abhi bhi soshal media par england ke ek purv khilaadi ke kaaran charchaa main he
 In this match, Australian players Steve Smith was hooting at the ground, after which Kohli asked him not to do so, after which Kohli was praised all around
 lekin england ke purv cricketer nik compton ne viraat kii iske liye aalochana kii
 After this he was fiercely pulled on social media and had to apologize to Virat
 nik compton ne ek video main kaha, 'mujhe nahin lagata ki viraat ke paas warner or smith par hooting karne vaale prashansakon ko rokane kaa koi adhikaar tha, agar sach kaha jaae to vah krupaalu he!' iske baad soshal media par wo trol ho gaye
 i don't think Virat Kohli had any right to tell fans to stop booing at Warner and Smith but rather clap them

 After the match, Kohli said, 'because there were so many Indian fans here, i did not want him to leave here with a bad attitude

 aam aadmi party ke sutron ke mutabit 26 march ko gujarat ke gandhinagar main prastaavit aam aadmi party kii jansabha ko ek kaaryakarta sammelan main tabdeel kar diya gaya he
 According to the plan before the Punjab elections, Kejriwal was going to blow the trumpet for the assembly elections to be held this year in Gujarat on 26 March in Gandhinagar
 lekin donon rajyon ke nateezon ne kejariwal ke sabhi armaanon par pani pher diya he
 According to the programs, Gopal Rai will conduct the party in Gandhinagar on March 26 to hold a worker conference
 vahiin is kaarykram main arvind kejariwal ke shaamil hone par suspence ban gaya he
 According to reliable sources of the Aam Aadmi Party, Arvind Kejriwal may cancel plans to go to the party workers' dialogue in Gandhinagar, Gujarat on March 26
 puure kaarykram ko party ke gujarat incharge gopal raay sanchalit karenge jo philhal gujarat main hi deraa daale hue hai or pradesh main sanghathan vistaar kaa kaam dekh rahe hai

 aise main gujarat main jo pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa garh he, vahaan ghusakarabijepico chunauti dena kejariwal ke liye behad mushkil ho saktaa he

 amit shah ne twit kar kaha kiya tha 'pulavama hamale ke baad piem modi ne apni airforce ko aatankiyon ko maarane ke liye bheja tha' iske jawaab main asaduddin ovaisi ne twit kar kaha 'modi kii sena, modi kii vaayu sena, modi kaa parmaanu 'pataakhaa'

 BJP President Amit Shah had also mentioned the Pulwama attack in Birbhum, Bengal, accusing Mamata Banerjee of committing illusion with the terrorists
 unhone kaha, 'jo hamaare 40 jawan ko maar de, usase baatcheet kerani chahie yaa bam giraanaa chahie? kya karnaa chahie? mamata di aapako aatankiyon ke saath ilu-ilu karnaa he to kariye
 This is the BJP government, will be shot from Pakistan, will be fired from here '
 is dauraan amit shah ne kaha ki pulavama hamale ke baad piem modi ne apane air force ko aatankiyon ko maarane ke liye bheja tha
 Let me tell you that on 14 February, Mamata Banerjee accused the Modi government of doing politics on the blood of the soldiers, citing the martyrdom of 40 soldiers in Pulwama
 saath hi mamata ne kaha tha ki modi sarkaar ko pulavama hamale kii puri jaankaree thi, baavjood iske javaanon ko nahin bachaaya gaya
 Now the BJP is surrounding him on the issue of terrorism

 mumbai hamale ke dauraan shahid hue hemanth karkare par sadhvi pragna thakur ke bayaan par ovaisi ne kaha tha 'sadhvi ne kaha tha ki shahid police adhikari ko shraap laga isliye unka ant hua
 This statement is not only irresponsible but insulting to the brave officers who sacrificed their lives while fighting the terrorists who came from Pakistan for the security of the country
 sadhvi pragna se pehle menka ke bayaan par ovaisi ne kadi pratikriya di thi
 Owaisi had said that Maneka Gandhi should understand that the vote is not a feudal salute nor can she refuse to do the work of a particular community of people on the basis of the vote

 The investigation alleged that Vadra is the owner of 12, Bryanstone Square, a London-based property worth 1

 samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke varisht netaa ajam khan kaa kahana he ki siem yogi or duusare logon ne unhen bataaya he ki tajmahal shiv kaa mandir he
 Azam Khan said tightly, saying Taj Mahal is a sign of slavery and it should be dropped
 ajam khan ne kaha, 'shiv ji kaa mandir he tajmahal kyonki mujhe yogi ji ne bataaya
 And people also told that there is a temple of Shiva
 shiv ji kaa mandir bane iske liye aisa musalmaan kah rahaa he jo apane saath 10-20 hajaar musalamaanon ko lathi fawda lekar saath chalegaa yogi ji ke
 Not even further yogi ji se kandhe se kandhaa milakar
 The first shovel will kill Yogi ji, the second i will kill
 kyon khadi rahe ye gulaami kii nishaani
 ' # WATCH: Samajwadi Party's Azam Khan says,' Taj Mahal is a Shiv Temple, Yogi Ji (UP CM) and many other people told me this
 i am the kind of Muslim who walk with Yogi Ji & will also get 10-20 thousand other Muslims along, to demolish Taj Mahal

 com / rh3gmuhdpr — ANI UP (@aninewsup) June 28, 2018 Please tell, Azam Khantazmahal has often been criticized by the RSS and BJP
 isse pehle bhi unhone kai baar ise giraane kii baat kahi he
 Azam had quipped from the ARSS that, 'before building the Ram temple, these people talked about breaking the Taj Mahal
 ye log tajmahal ko todakar shiv mandir banaaen, ham inkaa saath denge
 'azam then said,' We want CM Yogi and PM Modi to break the Taj Mahal together
 yahaan shivalay banane main ham saath denge
 ' ajam khan or samaajawaadee party to jaise ek-duusare ke liye poorak hi ban gaye hai
 On the one hand, Azam Khan has managed to retain his importance in the party, on the other hand, the party has not failed to take full advantage of his presence
 samaajawaadee party ke sansthaapakon main se ek aazam khan kii pahchaan party ke muslim chehre ke rup main he
 Azam Khan, 64, a former cabinet minister from Uttar Pradesh and a seven-time member of the Legislative Assembly from Rampur, comes from Rampur
 ajam khan kaa prabhaav rajya ke pashchimi ilaake main zyaada he
 He was expelled from the party at the time of the 2009 Lok Sabha elections due to differences with him and then Samajwadi Party national general secretary Amar Singh
 donon ke bich matbhed kaa asli kaaran tha rampur sansadeey seat kaa chunaav
 Amar Singh wanted to make the then MP and film actress Jaya Prada a candidate for the Samajwadi Party but Azam Khan was opposing him
 party pramukh mulaayam singh ne amar singh kii baat maanate hue jaya pradaa ko hi rampur sansadeey kshetra se party kaa ummidavaar banaaya
 In opposition to this, Azam Khan was openly campaigning against Jaya Prada but ultimately Jaya Prada won from there
 party virdohi gatividhiyon main shaamil hone ke kaaran unhen party se baahar nikaal diya gaya
 But due to the differences between Mulayam Singh and Amar Singh, Amar Singh had to leave the party and after that Azam Khan again joined the Samajwadi Party
 aazam khan ek baar phir rampur se chunaav lard rahen hai, lekin unki jeet zyaada kathin nahin lagati, kyonki is seat se wo saat baar jeet chuke hai
 The real motto of the opposing parties is that they should be forced to devote more and more time in their constituencies so that they can campaign at least in Muslim dominated areas

 darasal, unhen mumbai kabhi pasand nahin aayaa
 Although she sometimes talks about her fellow actor Sanjeev Kumar in her Hindi film Aandhi and considers her one of the greatest actors, she has never been able to accept Mumbai as her own
 unhen hameshaa se kolkata bahut adhik pasand rahaa he
 Now since they live next to us, whenever we are in Kolkata, we eat food together
 main unase shikaayat bhi karti hum ki jab bhi main unke paas jaati hum to meraa vajan bad jaataa he kyonki ve mujhe har baar bahut zyada khaanaa khilaa detii hai
 She does not advise about food, but definitely says that i should go to the gym regularly

 unhone pichley saal 26 disambar ko kaha tha ki ve is bare main hycourt main punarvichaar yachika daalengi, par unhone abhi tak aisa kiya nahin he
 The reason for this delay may be due to the many contradictions seen in his petition

 Subbarao was present at a meeting held at Modi's house on the night of February 27, 2002, where, according to Zakia's claim, the Chief Minister had ordered the officials to avenge the killing of 59 people at Godhra railway station by attacking Hindus against Muslims

 The author wrote about this book - from the Fascists' men-in-law torture and death camps to the Siberia exile camps and the imprisons with American prison-industrial alliances are more or less the same story! In the terminology of Angela Davis, the leading American activist of civil liberties - the story of slavery still continuing today! The Indian jails, called reform houses, are hardly different! Marxist ideologue and Communist leader Antonio Gramshi, convicted for twenty years in prison of fascists in Italy, did not complete even ten years of conviction that his body responded! He was released a month before his death! But the charged solitude of these moon years spent in prison, as he used it for his deep discussion about the history of Italy, its culture, Marxist philosophy and the Communist Party, put his prison diary on par with the world's best prison-writing! Especially for those involved in the Communist parties, it opened up a whole new field of thinking like this! Gramshi's entire writing to mentally liberate the communists from all ideological roots required for any Marxist
 Writing is a challenge! This diary of a few days spent in jail with such a thinker can prove to be a very useful experience for any reader, especially political-social workers! Its transparent language, ingrained subtle anguish and free-flowing thought have given this book a unique work of its kind! Book excerpt: Sirhane Gramshi; Life of a Communist - Arun Maheshwarigramshi is a political theorist
 It is a challenging writing to be mentally free from all ideological roots

 sahitya or samskruti ke naanaa vishyon par unhone ascharyajanak vishleshnatmak dhang se roshni daali he
 But all this has been done basically under the needs of the Communist Party of Italy and the socialist revolution in that country
 italy ke samaaj kii vargeey sanrachana kya he, iskaa saanskrithik itihaas kya rahaa he, logon kii maansik bunaavat kisi he, arthvyavastha ke vikaas kaa swaroop or rasta kya he- yah sab communist party kii raajnneetik jaruraton ke antargat hi unke vichaar ke vishay bane hai
 But politics has some ironies
 vah saamaajik parivartan ke kitne hi mahat or doorgaami uddeshy ko lekar kyon na chal rahi ho, kaaphi had tak samasamyikta uskaa prasthaan or gantavya donon hi hote hai
 That is why political thinking does not have the same continuity and eternity as philosophical philosophical concerns
 vah hameshaa ek desh-kaal saapeksh satya hota he, koi dhruv, atal satya nahin
 This is the reason why political leaders and theorists too can often be seen to be changing their views and analysis quite rapidly
 main yahan dalbadalu, avasarwaadi raajnneetigyon kii baat nahin kar rahaa hoon
 For them, past, present, future is nothing in the perspective of anyone, except their own personal interests, country, age and society
 main un gambheer raajnneetivettaon kii baat kar rahaa hoon jo apane samay ke sabhi ghaat-pratighaaton ke bich bhavishya ko ek swaroop pradaan karne ke liye vartmaan main hastkshep karne par vichaar kiya karte hai
 Gramshi holds a prominent place in such first-line important Marxist politicians
 ve marxvaadi darshan ke ek siddh vichaarak, samaajawaadee kranti ke vigyaan ke visheshgy or vishwa paristhitiyon ke prakhar gyaata the
 Born in 1891, Gramshi died on April 27, 1937
 mrityu ke pehle lagbhag 10 varsh unhone musolini ke jail main kaate
 He was arrested in 1926 along with several other communist leaders and in June 1928, he was sentenced to 20 years and 8 months
 jail main rahete hue hi ve kaaphi biimaar ho gaye or beemaari kii sangeen avasthaa main 1937 ke armbh main unhen jail se reeha kiya gaya
 On 25 April this year, his brain vein broke and he died on 27 April 1937
 gramshi 17-18 varsh kii umr main hi italy ke samaajwaadiyon ke sampark main aa gaye the tathaa karl marks kii rachanaaon kaa adhyayan shuru kar diya tha
 From 1913, he came in contact with the Communists of Italy
 snaatak kii padhai ko bich main hi chhodkar 1915 main ve sirf 24 saal kii umr main turin se prakashit samaajawaadee akhbaar 'avanti!' tathaa samaan vichaar ke duusare akhabaaron main kaam karne lage
 Along with this, he continued to study for his thesis on philology separately
 is prakaar shuru se communist party ke prakashnon se judakar gramshi us samay ke vishwa communist aandolan kii sabhi vichaardhaaratmak bahason se sirf parichit hi nahin rahete the, balki nirantar lekhan ke jariye un bahason main shirkat bhi kiya karte the
 He became a prominent leader of the Communist Party of Italy with deep ties to the Communist International
 1917 kii rus kii samaajawaadee kranti ke baad puure europe ke raajnneetik agenda par samaajwaad aa chukaa tha or iske saath hi pashchimi europe main, khaastaur par germany, italy or spain main poonjeewaad ke sabase khoonkhaar or barbar rup—najeevaad or fasiwad—ubharkar saamne aae the
 Due to this the political scene of the whole of Europe was quite confusing and fluid
 samaajawaadee kranti rus se aage nahin bad pai
 With birth, the socialist Soviet Union had to face the blockade of imperialists
 najeevaad or fasiwad ne communiston ko unheen ke santhnik taur-tareekon ke aadhaar par parrast karne kii ranneeti apanaai thi
 There was no shortage of small, popular slogans
 saath main aadhunik rajya kii shakti ke prayog se unhone sansadeey janatantr ko saream kuchalakar virodhiyon ke barbar daman kaa rasta apanaaya
 The ship of socialist revolution remained confined to Russia, it could not go anywhere else
 isiilie 1917 or uske chand varshon baad tak ke vishwa communist aandolan kii sthiti ek thi or 1922 main musolini or phir hitler or franko ke udai, rajasattaaon par unke balaat adhikaar or communiston sahit janatantric vipaksh kii sabhi partiyon or vyaktiyon ko nestnabud kar dene ke uddeshy se chalaae gaye krurtam daman chakra ke samay kii sthiti duusari thi
 Where was the imagery of the communist revolution's conquering the chariot going everywhere, and where the entire communist movement of Europe faced the threat of survival itself
 stallin ne burjua dwaara phenk die gaye janatantr ke jhande ko communiston dwaara uthaane kaa aahvaan inhen paristhitiyon main kiya tha
 Dimitrov of Finland termed the creation of a joint front of all anti-fascist-nazi forces as the first and most important duty of the communists
 kehane kaa taatpary yah ki gramshi jis samay italy kii communist party ke ek mahatvapurn netaa or marxvaadi vichaarak or siddhantkaar ke rup main sakriy the, us kaal main italy sahit puure europe kii raajnneetik paristhiti main baari uthal-puthal machi hui thi
 Even within the Communist Party of Russia, events of intense ideological struggle had taken place on many important subjects at that time
 lenin kii 'ek desh main samaajwaad' or 'nai aarthik niti' (hrishvakk) jaise muddon par plakhnov, tratski aadi netaaon ke saath teevr bahes hui thi
 Trotsky was adamant on the ideas of 'world Socialist Revolution' and 'sanatan Revolution'
 communist international ke andar bhi samrajyavaadee yuddh ke bare main drushtikon ko lekar baari matbhed the
 The opposition of Stalin and Trotsky had turned towards another type of open hostility
 tratski ko palaayan karke duusare desh main sharan leni padi thi
 What should be the nature of the relationship between the Communist Party and the Soviet State, how to maintain the right balance under socialism between the rights of the state and the rights of citizens, the decadence of capitalism and its inevitable overcoming of the Communist International's assessments and frequent declarations Despite the negligible impact of the communist movement in the developed capitalist countries and the continued power of capitalism What is the secret of becoming a tishali - all these questions had emerged in front of the world communist movement only while Gramshi
 aaj 90 varsh baad, soviet sangh or samaajawaadee shivi ke ant ke baad to ye sabhi sawaal puri duniya ke communist aandolan ko buree tarah math rahe hai
 Similarly, what should be the organizational form of the Communist Party, can the Communist Party's structure based on a bureaucratic manner of command system fulfill the historical responsibility that would make the whole human civilization a new, completely equal, just and humane Provides the responsibility of giving shape? The thing to note is that Gramshi has given all these questions, especially of his prison life
 The time was considered very seriously
 unhone aise kisi bhi kshtdaayi sawaal se kataraane ke bajaay unako sahi bhaavana ke saath ek marxvaadi vichaarak ke rup main sweekaara tha
 They bumped into them and broke many of the same deep-rooted concepts inside themselves in the clash which was far from the truth and in the meantime tried to read the new path of socialist revolution
 jo sawaal aaj bhi communist aandolan ke liye vikat prashn bane hue hai, un par gramshi kaa gahan antardrushti ke saath kiya gaya alokapaat itnaa abhinav or vicharottejak he ki mrityu ke 75 saal baad bhi ve sabhi marxvaadi vichaarkon or raajnneetividon ke liye aakarshan kaa vishay bane hue hai
 From the above description, it is evident that Gramshi had seen many forms of rise and fall of the communist movement during his lifetime, recognized rapid changes in the circumstances and offered to create a new theory of revolutionary works by analyzing them
 isiilie swaabhaavik taur par unke lekhan main kisi ko bhi anek prakaar kii visangatiyon or antervirodhon ke digdarshan ho sakate hai
 This is the irony of any compilation of analyzes of current political developments
 yahi vajah he ki shuru main hamane unhen ek raajnneetik siddhantkaar bataakar jis baat se abhihit karaane kii koshish kii he, vah inhen yatkinchit visangatiyon or antervirodhon kii baat he
 On this basis, we want to prepare our critique of Gramsci
 isse ve sari baaten saamne aaengi, jinke kaaran aaj bhi puure marxvaadi, communist halake main gramshi kaa danka baj rahaa he
 Eric Hobsbawm has written very accurately in the role of this compilation that "rightly, as a communist thinker Gramsci attracted the attention of people outside Italy because he provided a Marxist strategy for the countries in which so far The revolution could have been an inspiration, but not a model
 arthath gaiyr-krantikari vaataavaran or paristhitiyon main samaajawaadee aandolan kii ranneeti
 '' There is a pain in the throat

Holi festival is close
 log taiyaariyon main jute gaye hai
 Everyone wants to look special on this festival of colors
 isliye kapadon kaa sahi chunaav behad jaruri he
 Let us know what kind of dress this Holi can prove to be better for you
 1-aap simple luk se bhi isaki shuruyaat kar sakate hai
 By wearing a simple kurta with trousers leggings and jeans, you can get a plain and heart-warming look
 2-agar aap tradishnal luk chaahati hai to aap jampasoot ke saath jacket pahan sakati hai
 Apart from this, the combination of a t-shirt with a knee-length printed skirt can also give you a different look
 agar aapako tadak-bhadak vaale rangon se parhez he to aap ke paas ek behatar vikalp he ki aap halke rang ke kapadon ke saath mail khate rang kaa scorf yaa stall bhi le sakati hai
 We make these 5 mistakes while washing face! 3-you are in touch with water while playing Holi
 is dauraan jaruri he ki aap apane footware par bhi dhyaan den
 Wearing heels can prove dangerous on these occasions
 isliye jaruri he ki aap rang khelte samay aisi chappal pahanen jisase naa phisalane kaa dar ho naa atak kar girane kaa
 4- During this time you should also take care of your hair
 jaruri he ki aap apane baalo ko acchhee tarah se baandh ke rakhen
 You can tie your hair or make ponytails so that you can enjoy Holi without worry
 in 5 chizon ke bina adhuri hogi aapaki holi5-holi khilne ke dauraan mechap karne kaa koi tuk nahin banataa
 Playing Holi with natural look will be more profitable deal
 aap iliner or muskara aakhon ke liye istemaal kar sakati hai
 Apart from this, lip balm can also be used to protect lips from dryness

 dilli dehaat main hukka pite-pite siyasat kii charchaaen garam hua karti hai, lekin in dinon hukke kii siyasat khub garm he
 The politics of tying Sehra between the Aam Aadmi Party and the BJP is underway over the ban on hookah bars running in Delhi
 hua yun he ki dilli main centre sarkaar ke ek notification ke baad tamaam restaurant or cafe main chalane vaale hukka baar ko band karne ke aadeshdilli sarkaarne jari kar diye
 When the Delhi Health Minister issued a statement about this on Tuesday, BJP MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa and MP Pravesh Verma came to the ground to retaliate
 pravesh verma ke mutabik centre sarkaar ne may 2017 main ek notificesh jari kar hukka baar par pabandi laga di thi
 In the notification, the Union Health Ministry has made a rule that no smoking item can be served by the restaurant in the smoking area of any restaurant
 yahi nahin khaane pine kii bhi koi cheez smoking aria main nahin parosi jaaegi
 If the customer wants, he can use the smoked goods brought with him in the smoking area of the restaurant and if he wants to drink some food after smoking then he can be served inside the restaurant
 lekin verma ke mutabik dilli sarkaar is aadesh par paanch maheene se baithi rahi
 BJP MLA Sirsa claimed that they filed a case in NGT after the Central Government's notification and appealed for ban on illegal hookah bars running in Delhi
 engiti ne bhidillisarkaar ko talab kiya
 Then the government woke up somewhere and now just by issuing a statement, Satyendar Jain is talking about ban on illegal hookahs, while did nothing in the name of action
 sirsa ne aarope lagaaya ki dilli sarkaar nashe ke is kaarobaar ko lekar sanjeeda nahin he or jaanboojhkar hukka baron par karrwai nahin kar rahi he
 Now the notification for ban on hookah bar was received from the center five months ago
 dilli sarkaar ne bhi pabandi kaa elaan kar diya, lekin abhi bhi hukkabar dhadlle se chal rahe hai or hukka baar par pabandi ke naam par sirf siyasat hi ho rahi he

 Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar has said that the army in Kashmir has the right to wait on the terrorists and to shoot at those gunmen instead of "being martyred"
 beeti raat goa ke vasco main bhaajapa kii ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue parrikar ne kaha, ‘‘jab maine raksha mantri kaa padbhaar sambhala to wo pehali cheez jo maine unase (sainikon se) kahi vah yah thi ki agar aap kisi bhi shaks ke haath main mashinagan yaa pistaul dekhen to usase yah ummid nahin karen ki vah aapse ‘halo’ karne aayaa he

 vishwa hindu parishad (vihip) ke itihaas se agar masjid or ayodhya shabd nikaal die jaaen to uske hisse main purusharth ko sabit karne ke liye bahut kuch bachataa nahin he
 Apart from these two words, there is also a person who gives significance to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad
 us vyakti kaa naam he mulaayam singh yadav
 On October 15, VHP international patron Ashok Singhal was taking the same words and the same third person in Delhi, but the atmosphere did not cause any particular excitement
 ashok singhl ne kaha ki samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav ayodhya main musalamaanon ke dabaav main masjid banavaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 For this, 200 acres of land has been identified and a retired judge has been trying to carry out this work for the last two years
 yah ashok singhl 2012 ke ashok singhl hai
 Just think, if this Singhal would have been the Singhal of 1992 and accused Mulayam Singh of secretly trying to build a mosque and Muslim culture center in Ayodhya, what would have been the news? Singhal has a gap of two decades between 1992 and today
 or keval ashok singhl main hi yah faasla kyon dekhen? is arase main mulaayam singh, masjid or ayodhya sabamein do dashak kaa faasla aa chukaa he
 The time has passed two decades
 isliye jab ashok singhl mulaayam singh par itnaa gambhir aarope lagane ke liye press conference bulaate hai to patrakaron kaa koi rela nahin tut padataa
 Those who come also raise less questions
 peeche baithe kuch patrakaron ne to press conference ke bichobich sawaal poochne kii bajaae singhl par hi chuhalbaji karne main zyada ruchi dikhaai
 If this Singhal were the ninth decade Singhal, then what would have happened after this revelation
 kam se kam khabar kii duniya main to koharaam machataa hi
 But today, the news of a column on his important revelation the next day hardly appeared anywhere
 ram mandir andolan ke do dashak baad bhale hi unhen yah hameshaa yaad rahata ho ki vihip desh ke sant samaaj kaa pratinidhitiv karti he or sant samaaj kaa anadar bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 But now the public does not remember this old jumla
 do dashakon ke is lambey badlaav main ‘kal kaa chhora arvind kejariwal’ singhl se zyada mahatvapurn ho jaataa he jo ki vahaan se thodi hi duuri par muslim samaaj se hi aane vaale ek kendriya mantri ke khilaaf dharna de rahaa hota he
 If Singhal is kept waiting for a TV channel from the vhp's media center for a while to stop speaking, a dozen OV vans stood for live broadcast at Kejriwal's dharna on Parliament Street, right next door
 ashok singhl or vihip ke liye samay sachmuch badal chukaa he
 This is the difference of two decades which VHP has not yet understood
 jis ram mandir andolan se rajnatik vikalp ke taur par bijepi paidaa hui, us bijepi ne bhi kabhi ashok singhl ko santusht kar diya ho, aisa nahin he
 There was never any work on the temple plan during the six-year NDA regime
 paramhans ramchandradaas apni aakhri tamanna liye duniya se kooch kar gaye lekin atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar ne unki tamanna ko tamanna hi rah jane diya
 During this six-year rule of the NDA, the RSS also believed that the central government was more important than the Ram temple, so Singhal remained under pressure from the RSS for almost the entire six years that he would never do anything unpleasant that would harm the center
 -congress government be deprived of completing five-year term
 iske alaava umr ke asar or hridayrog ne bhi singhl kii uttejnaa ko shant karne kaa hi kaam kiya he
 Even though there is no sign of age and disease in his voice even today, he has probably understood that now his speaking is nothing more than a blatant statement
 vihip ke liye singhl se bada vyaktitv doosraa nahin he lekin parishad kaa kaam-kaaj ab duusare logon ke haath main he
 At the same time, there was no coordination with the BJP that the BJP should move forward on some issue at the behest of the VHP
 shaayad yahi kaaran he ki ek patrkaar ne jab unase poocha ki is sambandh main bijepi se bhi koi baat hui he to singhl ne badi rukhaai se kaha ki ‘‘baat to hoti rahati he
 You (journalists) also go there (BJP office)
 aap bhi baat kariye
 "that is why Singhal also understands that in the flow of twenty years, the Bharatiya Janata Party has drifted so far away from them that there is no possibility of a one-time meeting
 shaayad yahi kaaran he ki ayodhya, masjid or mulaayam singh yadav kaa jaadui trikon chhu lene ke baad bhi singhl ko sunne main patrakaron ne bhi koi khaas ruchi nahin dikhaai
 This magical triangle once made VHP a representative organization of Hindus
 vahi jaadui trikon bees saal baad ek baar phir saamne dikh rahaa he lekin vihip main hi vah madda nahin bachaa he ki use mudda bana sake or bhunaa paae
 Its claim to be a representative organization of Hindus seems to have faded
 ashok singhl aaj bhi jor dekar yahi kehete hai ki agar ayodhya main koi masjid bani to puraa desh ashaant ho jayega lekin unki ashaant kar dene vaali yah chetavanee kisi ko baichaiyn nahin kar paa rahi
 Ironically, even if there is truth in Singhal's claims, there is no one left to listen to him

 Union Ministers Nirmala Sitharaman and Arun Jaitley on Wednesday dismissed the allegations of former Union Ministers Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie in relation to the Rafale fighter jet deal and said that the government has already responded in Parliament in this regard
 purv kendriya mantri yashavanth sinha or arun shouri ne kaha kirafel sauda'yaad rakhaa jane vaala aapraadhik kadachaar' kaa maamla he or yah boforce ghotaale se bhi kaaphi bada he

 The minister tweeted that the government had already responded to the allegations in Parliament

 All allegations being levelled in various press conferences are already answered on the floor of the Parliament
 a recent attempt, in the House, to malign the government through baseless charges collapsed
 Today’s was yet another attempt at repeating fabricated facts
 # Rafale — Nirmala Sitharaman (@nsitharaman) August 8, 2018 While Union Minister Arun Jaitley termed the complaints of malfunctions in the Rafale fighter jet deal as 'unnatural' and 'the lie was flouted again' and said these allegations They are being imposed by forces that are constantly getting desperate to prove their relevance
 jetali ne fasebuk par 'da rafel falsahud ripited' sheershak se likhaa, 'aaj doharaaye gayi niraadhaar aaropon main ratti bhar sachai nahin he or na hi bebuniyaad aaropon ke samarthan main jutaye gayi kathith tathy evam baari bharkam dastavej kii pushti ke liye kuch he
 Sinha and Shourie, addressing a press conference with advocate-activist Prashant Bhushan, raised a number of questions regarding the Rs 58,000-crore deal to purchase 36 Rafale fighter jets from France
 rajg sarkaar ke katu aalochak ke rup main jane jane vaale in teenon logon ne pradhanmantri narendra modi par akele hi saude se jude maanakon ko badalane kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha ki saude ko antim rup main dene main aavashyak prakriyaaon kaa gambhir ulanghan kiya gaya
 He alleged that the entire deal was a "unique case of criminal misconduct, misuse of public office and conciliation of parties at the cost of national interest and national security"
 ' teenon logon ne kaha ki sarkaar ne tathyon ko 'chhipaane' kaa prayaas kiya
 The Congress has been alleging huge irregularities in the Rafale deal
 uskaa kahana he ki sarkaar ek rafel vimaan ke liye 1,670 karod rupee kaa bhugtan kar rahi he, jabaki samprag sarkaar ne 126 rafel vimaanon kii kharid ke liye ek rafel kii keemat kaa sauda 526 karod rupee main kiya tha
 Sinha, Shourie and Bhushan also rejected the government's argument that the price of aircraft increased due to their specialties and specific weapon systems
 rafel saude ko desh kaa ab tak kaa 'sabase bada raksha ghotaalaa' qaraar dete hue bhushan ne aarope lagaaya ki isse sarkari khajaane ko kam se kam 35 hajaar karod rupee kaa nuksaan hua he
 Jaitley said, "unconfirmed accusations against the government are nothing, but lie has to be re-introduced by the forces who are constantly getting desperate to prove their relevance
" sarkaar ne pehle hi is mudde par vikrut kar pesh kii gayin chizon evam dushprachaar kaa prabhavi tareeke se jawaab de diya tha
 He said that these allegations are just another attempt to discredit the government by spreading lies and fabricated facts about the agreement reached between the two governments in 2016 for the purchase of Rafale fighter aircraft
 unhone kaha ki yah or bhi nindaneey he ki sarkaar kii chhavi dhoomil karne kii nayi koshish sansad main aisi hi koshish ke aundhe munh girane ke lagbhag do hafte baad kii gai he
