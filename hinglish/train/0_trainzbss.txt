 In September, 77 out of 78 inmates refused to provide a copy of Farloferlo's application to Ajay Chautala, Deputy Chief Minister of Haryana and Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) chief Dushyant Chautala, two weeks from Tihar Jail
 The case of furloughs caught fire in October itself
 is ghatnakram par congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi wadra ne 26 oktober ko bhartiya janata party ke netritv vaali centre sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra then tweeted - "all India corruption washing machine is on!"
 akhil bhartiya bhrashtachar dhulaai mashin chaalu aahe!https: / / t
 co / fyalfymm0c — Priyanka Gandhi Vadra (@priyankagandhi) October 26, 2019 Priyanka Gandhi has put BJP in the dock because Ajay Chautala was released two weeks from Tihar Jail just hours after BJP announced to form a coalition government in Haryana with JJP
 The news of getting furlough came
 ajay chautaala avaidh bhartee ghotaale main tihaad main 10 saal kii sajaa kaat rahe hai
 The ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi said in a statement, “the BJP government in Haryana has rewarded Ajay Chautala for supporting the JGP
 ”dilli sarkaar se salaah nahincongress ne dilli kii AAP sarkaar ko ajay chautaala ko farlo die jane ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya
 Reversing the Congress, the AAP said that Farlow was given by the Director General (DG) of Tihar Jail and no advice was taken from the Home Minister of Delhi Government or anyone else in the government on the issue
 aakhir is maamle kaa sach kya tha? kisne do hafte ke liye ajay chautaala ko jail se azaadi di thi? kya farlo dene ke peeche koi raajnneetik pahalu bhi tha? inhen sab sawaalon kaa jawaab jaanane ke liye india today ne soochna ke adhikaar (RTI) ke tahat mahanideshak (diji) karagaar, tihaad jail ke daftar ko yachika bheji
 Who gave furlough to Ajay Chautala? "who decided to give Ajay Singh Chautala furlough in October 2019?" The DG Prison office answered this question- “the Director General of Prisons is a competent officer to deliver furloughs
 ” isse sanket miltaa he ki is maamle main rajya sarkaar ne koi bhoomika nahin nibhaai lagati
 Our second question in the RTI petition was- When did Ajay Singh Chautala apply for furlough? The reply was received from the office of DG Prison- “siddhadoshi Ajay Chautala son Om Prakash Chautala applied for furlough on 03 / 10 / 2019
 ”iskaa matlab he ajay chautaala ke aavedan par sakaaratmak jawaab aane main 23 din kaa vakt laga
 Ajay Chautala got furlough just hours after the deal was struck for the BJP-JJP alliance in Haryana
 ye sanyog ho bhi ho saktaa he or nahin bhi
 On what basis did the RTI reply of Fairloswal get, it cannot be said conclusively whether Ajay Chautala got furlough at such a time or it was rewarded in exchange for alliance deal? ”on what basis did Ajay Singh Chautala Go to furlough? " The DG Prison office's answer to our question was- "according to DPR 2018, no basis is needed to give furloughs
" ”isi sawaal ke tihaad kii jail number 2 se mili jawaab main kaha gaya- ‘ye (farlo) ‘paatrata ke aadhaar’ par di gai
 'refusal to provide the copy, we had requested to provide a certified copy of Ajay Choutala's application and a copy of the last page of the file on which the order was made
 is par diji karagaar ke daftar kaa jawaab tha- “teesri party se judi soochna hone kii vajah se soochna uplabdh nahin karai ja sakati
 In response to the same question, Jail No
 2 said- 'this information cannot be made available under Section 8 (1) (j) of the' Right to Information Act 2005 'because it is third party information
 doshasiddh ajay chautaala ne artiai act 2005 ke tahat aavedan main maangi gai kisi bhi soochna ko saajha karne se inkaar kiya he
 We had another question under the RTI - "how many prisoners were furloughed in September and October 2019?" Jail number 2 responded to this - 'in September 78 prisoners applied for it, except 77 all got it
 oktober main 112 ne farlo ke liye aavedan kiya tha jinamein se 106 ko jail athurity kii manjuuri mil gai

 In such a situation, discussing with the selectors Virat Kohli about the T20 team, is there any message to Dhoni? modi sarkaar ne buudhvaar ko dhan kaa nunatam samarthan mulya (MSP) 200 rupee badha diya he
 In the cabinet meeting today, the government has decided to increase the MSP of the Kharif crop
 isse kisaanon ko unki fasal kaa behatar mulya milane kaa rasta khul gaya he
 What happens to the minimum support price? The minimum support price (MSP) system has been implemented to protect the interests of farmers
 agar kabhi fasalon kii keemat gir jaati he, tab bhi sarkaar tay nunatam samarthan mulya par hi kisaanon se fasal kharidti he
 Through this, the government tries to reduce their losses
 maujuuda samay main isamen ye utpaada shaamil hai
 - Cereals: Paddy, Wheat, Barley, Jowar, Millet, Maize and Ragi- Pulses: Gram, Arhar / Tur, Moong, Urad and Lentil- Oilseeds: Groundnut, Mustard, Toriya, Soyabean, Surajmukhi Seeds, Sisam, Kusumbhi and Khursani
 , Copra, raw cotton, raw jute, sugarcane, Virginia Flu Treated (BFC) tobacco, coconut
 aise tay karti he sarkaar:bharat sarkaar krishi laagat or mulya ayog (CACP) kii sifarish par kuch fasalon ke buvaai satr se pehle hi nunatam samarthan mulya kii ghoshnaa karti he
 This ensures the farmers that the government will give them a fixed minimum support price even if their crop prices fall in the market
 ye he uddeshy:nunatam samarthan mulya kii vyavastha isliye laai gai he taaki bazaar main fasal kii keemten kam hone ke baad kisaanon ko majaboorivash apni fasal kam keemat par na bechni pade
 The minimum support price comes when the price of the crop in the market falls drastically due to other reasons, including bumper production
 to aise maukey par sarkaar kisaanon se nunatam mulya par fasal kharid leti he
 These things are decided keeping in mind MSP: Whenever the CACP recommends the MSP, it decides it only after taking into consideration some things
 iske liye- utpaada kii laagat kya he
 - How much the input values have changed
 - bazaar main maujuuda keemton kaa kya rukh he
 - What is the situation of demand and supply? - antarrashtriya mulya sthiti,- iske alaava siesipi sthani, jile or rashtriya va antarrashtriya str kii sthitiyon kaa jayja lene ke baad hi sab tay karata he
 The picture of which political party will come together in Bihar's election ground is getting clearer to a large extent
 jediu adhyaksh sharad yadav ne kaha he ki unki party RJD or congress ke saath milakar vidhansabha chunaav ladegi
 Sharad Yadav's statement has come at a time when the merger of Janata Parivar has not taken the form of reality despite all the earlier claims
 janata parivaar kii partiyon kaa vilay ab tak bayaanbajiyon main hi ulajhakar rah gaya he
 In such a situation, Sharad Yadav's statement is considered very important
 chunaav main bahut zyada vakt nahin bachaa he, isliegathabandhan main or derihone par public ke saamne galat massej jaataa

 The Shiv Sena, an ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party, is adamant on the 50-50 formula amidst the pull of power in Maharashtra
 vahiin, maharashtra ke nivartmaan mukhyamantri or bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke netaa devendra fadanvis kisi bhi morche par peeche hatane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 The BJP has made it clear that it will also keep many important ministries including home and finance

 The party also announced its meeting with the Governor of Maharashtra soon
 aditya thakare ne vidhayak dal ke netaa pad ke liye scindia kaa naam or or mukhya sachetak pad ke liye sunil prabhu kaa naam prastaavit kiya
 Aditya Thackeray said, 'it was my privilege as an elected MLA to propose the name of Eknathji as the leader of the Shiv Sena Parliamentary Party to work for the mlas
 sunil prabhu ji ko vidhayika ke liye party ke mukhya sachetak ke rup main chunaa gaya he
 'the party is going to meet Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari soon, which has given rise to speculation
 shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne kaha ki rajyapal ke saath baithak kar unhen vastusthiti se avgat karaayaa jayega
 On the other hand, the BJP Legislature Party held a meeting on Wednesday afternoon and elected former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis as the leader of the Legislature Party
 baithak ke turant baad fadanvis ne kaha tha ki janadesh bhaajapa-shivasena gathbandhan ke liye he or donon milakar sarkaar banaaenge
 Earlier on Tuesday, heated and counter-rhetoric continued between the two sides
 shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne bhaajapa par qaraar ko nazarandaaj karne kaa aarope lagaaya, vahiin devendra fadanvis ne shivasena ke 50-50 formule ke daawey ko khaarij kar diya tha
 Later, on Tuesday evening, Shiv Sena canceled its meeting with the BJP leadership, in which Amit Shah and Bhupendra Yadav were to participate
 bhaajapa ne saal 2014 main shivasena ke bina hi rashtravaadi congress party (rakanpa) kaa baahar se samarthan lekar sarkaar banaai thi
 US clergy Terry Jones, who burnt the Quran, was briefly jailed by an American court on Friday

 This demonstration could have spread violence
 adaalat main apni peshi ke dauraan jones ne kaha ki quran puure vishwa main aatanki gatividhiyon ko badhaava detaa he
 It cited the First Amendment of the US Constitution, stating that it gives the right to protest against Islam
 adaalat ne in donon par ek-ek dollar kaa jurmaana lagaaya, jise unhone dene se manaa kar diya or unhen jail janaa padaa
 But after an hour it paid the fine
 jones or sap dwaara quran jalaae jane ke baad afghanistan main kaaphi hinsa hui thi or 7 americanyon samet 20 logon ko jaan ganvaani padi thi
 If you expect governments to be thoughtful, rational and targeted, then bow your head
 
 
 notebandi or sarkari naukariyon tathaa shikshan sansthaaon main garibon ko aarakshan main samanta ko pakadifee, aapako sarkaar par fida hona padegaa
 In demonetisation, the government did not know what to achieve from this economic earthquake
 notebandi se pehle sarkaar ke paas desh main kaale dhan ke aankade nahin the or nae aarakshan ke baad desh ke garibon ko yah pataa nahin ki unhen isse kaise or kya milegaa kyonki sarkaar ne garibi yani kamai ko naapane-jokhane yaa garibon ko pahchaanane kii yojana hi multavee kar di
 The latest narrative of poverty measurement is very interesting, that in March 2015, the government formed a 14-member team led by the then Deputy Chairman of NITI Aayog, Arvind Panagariya, to set a new definition of poverty by 31 August 2015 and a strategy to reduce poverty
 Had to be made
 kaarykaal vistaar ke baad june, 2017 main isaki report pradhanmantri tak aa gai, tab tak garibon ko aarakshan dene kaa sarkaar kaa koi iraadaa na tha or garibi yaa logon kii aay naap-jokh ko gaiyr jaruri maan liya gaya tha
 According to a study that formed the basis of this report (available on NITI Aayog's website till these lines are written)
 
 
 2009 main suresh tendulkar samiti ne garibi maapne ke formule (khapat kharch banaam kamai) ko nae sire se tay kiya, jiske tahat paanch logon ke gramin parivaar main pratimah 4,080 rupye or shaharon main 5,000 rupye se kam kamai vaale log garibi kii rekha se neeche hai
 This was revised by the Rangarajan Committee, but with it, poverty began to increase further
 isliye, bakaul niti ayog, suresh tendulkar kii gananaa hi aadhikarik garibi rekha he
 Although it has many flaws
 modi sarkaar ne sarkari skiimon (ujjwala, bijli, shauchalay) ke labhaarthiyon kii pahchaan ke liye 2011 ke saamaajik aarthik surveykshan kaa istemaal shuru kiya
 However, this survey is only for the rural population and does not calculate the entire income or expenditure of the families
 niti ayog ne is vikalp ko bhi tatola ki garibi kii rekha tay karne ke bajaay desh kii sabase nirdhan 30 fisadi aabaadi kii jindagi main behatari par najar rakhkar garibi main kami maapi jaae jaisaa ki vishwa bank ne haal main kiya he
 
 
 Finally, saying that the objective of fixing the poverty line is to measure poverty reduction and no formula is needed to identify the poor
 
 
 niti ayog ne (bakaul dastavej) garibon kii pahchaan kii koshish ko chhod diya or sarkari skiimon ke asar par mukhaatib ho gaya
 There is no one measurement or identity of poverty before the economic reservation
 sarkaar ise jaanboojh kar bhram main rakhana chaahati he
 Both Tendulkar's formula (rationing to BPL) and the Socio Economic Survey of 2011 (other schemes) are being tried
 sarkaron kii houseing skiimon ke tahat 3 lakh ru
 There is also a scale to consider those belonging to the border as weak economic class and 3 to 6 lakh people as low income group
 is bich aarthik aarakshan main 8 lakh ru
 People with an annual income of up to Rs
 5 lakh will be included while their family has Rs
 5 lakh
 salanaa kamai vaale log inakam tex de rahe honge
 That is, the king whom he believes is poor
 isliye is samay desh main do tarah ke garib hanek—ve jo sach main nirdhan handusre—ve jinhen raajnneeti kii roshni main garib pahachaanaa jaaegasarkarein to janmana sahasrabahu hai, basharte ve kuch karnaa to chahen
 When they do not want to do anything, their thousand hands start hiding, misleading and tricking the truth
 is kaale jaadu kaa achook mantar hai aankade
 Numbers can be created by distilling them
 aankade chipa kar sach andhare main rakhaa ja saktaa he yaa aankadon kii jarurat hi khatm karte hue tathy, tark or paardarshita ke smarak banaae ja sakate hai
 However, the people of India, who have created sixteen Lok Sabha, are now beginning to understand this: if they lie to the government, it is a crime but if the government lied to the people

 is bujurg vakil or bijepi ke rajyasabha saansad ne saarvajanik rup se un baton ko jubaan de di jo bijepi ke bheetar ke gut ‘of da record’ hi kah sakate the
 On November 27, Jaitley is said to have tried to stop the storm, calling Narendra Modi requesting that he talk to Jethmalani, though it was not known whether Modi did it
 jethmalani bijepi main modi ke behad kareebi maane jate hai
 In 2010, despite all the protests, Modi played a decisive role in getting Jethmalani a Rajya Sabha ticket from Rajasthan
 ab is diggaj vakil ne bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke rup main modi ke liye apana samarthan jataayaa he
 Jethmalani openly played the bugle of war and took on both Jaitley and Swaraj
 unke hamale se party ke bheetar kii daraaren jaahir ho gayi
 While senior party leaders Yashwant Sinha and Shanta Kumar supported his demand for the resignation of party president Nitin Gadkari, Shatrughan Sinha, in his November 27 letter to Gadkari, favored Jethmalani in approving the appointment of new CBI chief Ranjit Sinha
 took
 gadakari ko likhi chitthee main jethmalani ne unka majaak udayah ‘‘mujhe pakkaa yakeen ho gaya he ki aap dridhtaapurvak aatmahatya ke raste par chal chuke hai or apane saath puri party ko ghaseet le jane kaa drudh sankalp bhi kar chuke hai
 Wisdom is an old saying against destruction
 ’’jethmalani sibiai pramukh ranjit sinha kii niyukti kaa virodh karne ke liye jetali se bhi do-do haath karne se nahin hichake or unhone jetali par sinha ko badnaam karne kii sajeesh kaa ang hone kaa iljaam lagaaya
 He said that the lawyer representing Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar, who challenged the government's decision to remove his name from the final panel of the three-nominated CBI Director post, was actually Jaitley's junior
 
 jethmalani ne gadakari ko likhaa, ‘‘yah bilkul asambhav he ki cat main chal rahi mukademebaaji kii jaankaree unako na rahi ho, or meraa andaja he ki aapane bhi jetali kii salaah par hi kaam kiya he
 However, Jaitley told the media on November 27 that the allegations were not worthy of any response
 jetali or swaraj donon ne hi sinha kii niyukti kaa virodh kiya tha
 He had asked the government to hold the appointment until the Lokpal bill was passed in Parliament
 jethmalani ne is chunaav or nishpaksh chayan prakriya ke liye pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii saraahna kii
 The Lokpal bill proposes to select the CBI chief from a collegium
 jethmalani darasal lokapal bill par salaah nahin liye jane se bhi naaraaz hai
 He said, "I am a senior member of Rajya Sabha and one of the founders of BJP but none of your current leaders of Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha have ever discussed me about Lokpal Bill
 ”jethmalani ke kareebi sutron kaa kahana he ki swaraj to asal main gehun ke saath ghun kii tarah pis gayi, varanaa hamale kaa asli nishaanaa jetali hi the
 The roots of their rivalry flourished in 2000 when Jaitley replaced Jethmalani as the Law Minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government
 us samay jethmalani kanoon mantri ke rup main tatkaaleen mukhya nyaayadhish e
 s
 anand or atarni general soli psorabji ke saath ek ladaai main uljhe the
 The issue became more complicated with the exchange of letters between Jaitley and Jethmalani
 aisi haalat main vaajapeyi ne jethmalani se istipha dene ko kaha
 Jaitley, then Minister of State for Commerce, was given the additional charge of the Law Ministry and soon he was elevated to the rank of Cabinet Minister
 ek varisht bijepi netaa bataate hai, ‘‘jethmalani ko hameshaa lagata tha ki vaajapeyi ko unhen mantrimandal se hataane ke liye uksaane vaale jetali hi the
 Vajpayee felt uncomfortable with Jethmalani anyway
 unhen tatkaaleen grih mantri laalkrishna adwani ke kehane par mantrimandal main shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Jethmalani was Advani's lawyer in the Ramjanmabhoomi case
 magar jethmalani ne adwani ke aatankwaad virdohi tada bill kaa virodh kar unhen bhi naaraaz kar diya
 Jethmalani contested and lost against Vajpayee in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections from Lucknow
 party ke andar kanoonee maamlat ke lihaaj se jetali ke sabase ahm pad hasil kar lene par jetali or jethmalani ke bich kaa yah manmutav jari hi rahaa
 Then when Jethmalani tried to return to the BJP with a Rajya Sabha seat, Jaitley opposed it
 modi ne apane kanoonee maamalon main jethmalani kii madad kii ummid main unka jamkar samarthan kiya
 Amit Shah, close to Modi, was in jail at that time
 modi se apni nikatataa ke liye mashhoor bijepi ke ek netaa aage bataate hai, ‘‘achche rishton ke chalate jetali ne jethmalani kii ummidavaari kaa virodh karne ke liye modi ko phone kiya
 Modi got angry and asked Jaitley if he wanted to see him in jail? ” Jethmalani is believed to have won the Rajya Sabha seat from Gujarat in lieu of fighting Amit Shah's case and giving legal aid to Modi
 aresas vichaarak es gurumurti or arun shouri ke saath party ke kor group kaa hissaa hone ke baavjood jethmalani kabhi party main apane liye ek majboot aadhaar banane main kaamyaab nahin ho paae
 His relationship with the RSS dates back to the Emergency
 janaadhar ke abhaav main unhen hameshaa balidaan karne laayak samajha jaataa he
 a BJP member says, "gadkari himself is as independent as Jethmalani
 ve apane boote to is varisht adhivaktaa ke khilaaf kisi tarah kii karrwai kar paane se rahe
 Only the party's parliamentary board can take any decision to expel them
 party ke varisht netaaon ke bare main jis tarah ke raaj ve jaanate hai, ve akele dam par party ko dubo sakate hai
 Not only is his memory tremendous, but he also keeps an explosive file about BJP leaders
 ”is kanoonee ghaagh ke aatmavishvaas ko 25 november ko kahi unki is baat se samajha ja saktaa he, ‘‘mere khilaaf karrwai karne kii kisi main himmat nahin he
 "accepting this, the BJP suspended him from party membership but could not expel him
" jethmalani ko ek kaaran bataao notice jari kiya gaya
 He replied in his familiar 'fuck you' style, saying that there is no merit in the show cause notice and that it is' worth throwing in the trash
 ’jethmalani beparwaah isliye hai kyonki unke paas khone ke liye kuch nahin he
 This is also the reason why people in BJP fear him
 shaatir kanoonee dimag, hazirajvaabi or kushal bhaashan kala se las ve na sirf ek pratibhashali vakil hi hai, varan ek ziddee pratidwandvi bhi he

 But its dangerous beauty has eclipsed the existence of naturally occurring trees and plants in the forest
 lantana biligiri pahadiyon par itani oonchai tak bad jaataa he ki isamen ooncha tagada hathi bhi chhip jaae
 It becomes so dense that the normal tree seedlings of the forest do not have sunlight and cannot grow

 Can we imagine a world in which there is room for all species — from the Anopheles mosquito to the Zika virus and all the creatures between the hump-backed whales and bees — to wield an ax to take care of nature Can't we instead work in harmony with its natural balance as some communities have done and continue to do? Can we not do this work by giving ourselves the birthright of wildlife, by restoring our consumerist nature instead of imposing the responsibility of their protection on others? Can we not reform the economic and political systems that are inviting the death of nature? For years, we have not been able to do anything meaningful in the name of effort

 The judiciary witnessed an extraordinary situation on Friday for the first time in the country
 supreme court ke maujuuda 4 jajon ne media ko sambodhit kiya
 Justice Chelameswar, the second-most senior judge after the Chief Justice, said in a press conference that the administration of the Supreme Court is not functioning properly, if this continues, the democratic situation will not be good
 supreme court ke 4 jajon dwaara chif justise (sijeai) deepak mishra ke khilaaf bagawati tevar apnaane ke baad karypalika, nyaaypalika or raajnneetik partiyon ke kai mahatvapurn vyaktiyon ke bayaan is mudde par aae
 On this matter, former Speaker of Lok Sabha Somnath Chatterjee, while addressing the media by the judges, said it was wrong
 saath hi ajtak se baat karte hue somnath chatarji ne kaha ki jaj bol rahe hai ki ab janata ko is maamle main nirnay lenaa he, to vah bataaen ki kya janata vot karke nirnay legi?ajtak se baat karte hue somnath chatarji ne kaha ki yah bahut dukh kii baat he
 This move of the judges has shocked democracy
 mere hisaab se kabhi nahin hona chahie
 We never thought that it could happen that the judges would go to the media and have problems
 somnath ke anusaar nyaaypalika loktantr ke liye bahut jaruri he
 If there were any differences between any judge, it should have been resolved by itself supreme court ke jaj bharat main sabase sammanit hote hai
 Somnath Chatterjee questioned why the judge came to the press? He says that if the public will decide, then i want to ask, how will the public take the decision? Will she vote or will the executive take a decision? Chatterjee said such action is a threat to democracy
 yah sulajhane kii jagah or samasya khadi karegi
 The judges have damaged the country's image by coming in front of the media
 nyaaypalika kamjor padegi to logon ke man main avishvaas failega or ab yah fail bhi chukaa he
 Let us know that on Friday morning the four judges said that if we did not put these things in front of the country and we did not speak, then democracy would end
 hamane chif justise se aniyamittaaon par baat kii
 He said that four months ago, all four of us had written a letter to the Chief Justice, which was about administration, we had raised some issues
 chif justise par desh ko faisla karnaa chahie, ham bas desh kaa karj adaa kar rahe hai
 In this case, Attorney General KK Venugopal said that on Saturday, all the squabbles between the judges of the Supreme Court will end and all the cases will be resolved

 jahaan aam aadmi ko apni hi bachat kaa paisa nikaalane ke liye lanbaa intjaar karnaa pad rahaa he vahiin nae karency note gaiyr kanoonee tareeke se jugad vaale logon ke paas pahunch rahe hai
 According to an estimate, 160 crore rupees have been seized after the demonetisation process started in the country
 aise main bada sawaal ye uth rahaa he ki notebandi ko lekar kya hamaari bankig vyavastha phulpruf he?aise hi sawaalon par central bank of india ke chairman rajeev rishi se baat kii gai to unka kahana tha ki ye jaanch kaa vishay he
 Generally it happens that when we get cash from the Reserve Bank of India, it goes into the currency chest
 har branch main iskaa puri tarah record rakhaa jaataa he
 It is registered as 'cash in Hand'
 phir ye record rakhaa jaataa he ki alag-alag khaaton se kitna cash baanta gaya
 It is all recorded in the computer system
 ham khud hairaan he ki ye kahaan ho rahaa he
 According to RBI sources, every branch of the bank is allocated at least 1 crore currency
 yahaan se bank uttaradaayi hote hai ki paise ko khataadhariyon ko transfar karnaa sunishchit kiya jaae
 To understand the leakage of the system one has to look at currency printing and their transfer route
 desh main 4 karency note priting press hai
 Two currency printing presses are at Dewas and Nashik under RBI
 inke alaava do karency printing press misuru or salboni main hai
 They are administered by the Reserve Bank of India, the Reserve Bank of India, a private entity
 in karency priting press se nae chape note deshbhar main RBI kii kshetreey branchon tak pahunchaae jate hai
 Tight security is exercised at every step on this entire route
 noton ko silband boxon main idhar se udhar le jaaya jaataa he
 There are 30 regional branches of RBI in the action taken by the Income Tax Department
 yahaan se note har bank kii kendriya branch ko bheje jate hai
 This is the last stop of the root, where some cracks have been found in the system

 Rajeev Rishi says, if we talk about 20 lakh bank employees and innumerable bank branches, 99 after demonetisation
 9 fisadi bank or branch puri mehnat or eemaandaaree se kaam kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, some poor employees cannot represent our efforts
 kaale dhan ke khilaaf muhim main bengaluru main RBI ke ek varisht adhikari kaa naam aade ke baad bhartiya bainkon ne khud kaa task force gathit kiya he
 They are also helping in the investigation
 rajeev rishi ne kaha ki bainkon se hamaari satarkta timen desh ke vibhinn hisson main kaam kar rahi hai
 She herself is going to the branches to make sure that nothing wrong like this happens there

 bhale hi iske liye niyam kanoonon kii dhajjiyaan hi kyon naa udaani pade
 Yes, this is the story of Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, where the additional first class AC in Padmavat Express was made for PS of a cabinet minister of Modi government
 is maamle ke saamne aane par railway board ke chairman ashvini lohani ne is ghatana kii jaanch ke aadesh de die hai
 According to railway sources, on October 21, the Padmavat Express, which reached Lucknow, was stopped at Outer itself and extra coaches were arranged in a hurry
 itnaa hi nahin, is puri prakriya main train kaa platform bhi badal diya gaya or in sabake bich train takreeban ek ghanta let ho gai
 According to sources, Railways arranged for additional coaches for PS Vinay Srivastava of Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar
 iske liye padmavat express ko roka gaya or PS ko dilli bhejne ke liye sabhi niyam taak par rakh die gaye
 The Railways commissioned an additional bogie with AC First Composite on the Padmavat Express to be sent to the capital Delhi along with the PS family
 yahi nahin, railway ke ek afasar ko is PS kii agavaani ke liye stesan par tainaat kiya gaya
 Due to the addition of additional coaches, the platform of the train was also changed, due to which the train was delayed for about one hour
 khaas baat yah he ki railway board ne niyam bana rakhaa he ki kisi bhi gaadi kaa plateform antim samay main nahin badla jayega kyonki isaki vajah se bhagdad machane kii ashanka rahati he lekin in sab niyamon ko darkinar kar ke kendriya mantri ke PS kaa puraa khyaal rakhaa gaya
 Vinay Srivastava is an officer of the Mechanical Service
 inaki patni bhi isi sarvice main hai
 He did not get a seat in the quota to go to Delhi, including the family
 is par raat ko takreeban 8 baje dilli se lakhanu ke railway adhikariyon ko PS ke liye atirikt dibbe kaa intjaam train number 14207 padmavat express main karaane kaa farmaan jari kiya gaya
 The chart of the Padmavat Express was finalized at 5:40 in the evening and even after the chart was made, dozens of passengers were left waiting
 udhar train ke aane se keval 55 minute pehle aadesh milane ke baad ek asi second va asi third bogi ko PS ke parivaar ke liye fatafat kaagajon par fitness de diya gaya
 In Lucknow, the train was supposed to arrive at 9:50 pm, but the platform of the train was changed from two to platform number 6 for putting an extra compartment
 is vajah se train outer par hi kaaphi der khadi rahi
 Meanwhile, the train was brought to the station after the arrival of additional coaches
 atirikt dibbe ko train ke peeche laga diya gaya or is sari ghatana ke baad train raat 10:35 par ravaanaa hui
 In this way, the Padmavat Express departed about 1 hour late than its scheduled time
 udhar kendriya mantri ke PS vinay shrivastav ne 'aaj tak' se ek baatcheet main safai dete hue kaha ki unhone alag se train main dibba lagavane ke liye kisi se koi baat nahin kii thi
 He said that his position in the railway can be understood from the fact that his Lucknow mail duplicate ticket was also not confirmed in the emergency quota
 vinay shrivastav ke mutabik, jab unka tikat nahin conform hua to charbagh railway stesan pahunche
 Railway officials there said that he would see in another train
 padmavat express main tyohaari bheed kii vajah se do atirikt dibbe lagaae gaye jisamen unhen bhi jagah mili
 According to him, he has traveled on the railway pass and has not recommended it to any person of the Railway Board
 udhar railway ke sutron ke mutabik is ghatana kii jaanch ke aadesh ho chuke hai lekin aalaa afasar yah baat kah rahe hai ki PS ke liye dibba nahin lagaaya gaya tha balki vatting main yatriyon kii sankhya zyada thi is vajah se atirikt coach lagaaya gaya
 The second Test match between India and South Africa continues in the Wanderers, but there is a match going on with it - Zaheer Khan vs Graeme Smith
 in donon ke bich is baar baaji maari he team india ke tej gendbaaj jahir ne
 On the second day of the match, Zaheer put Smith out of LBW and named the match in his name
 ye 14waan mauka he jab international cricket main jahir ne smith ko pavilion kaa rasta dikhaaya he
 Read: In the match report on the second day of the first Test match of the series, Smith appeared in front of Zaheer for the 7th time, before these two appeared in front of each other 25 times, in which Zaheer dismissed this legendary batsman 13 times
 smith ko isse pehle jahir kii gend par hi jeevandaan mila tha lekin jab vah 68 ran par khel rahe the tab bhartiya tej gendbaaj ne unhen elbeadblyoo out kar diya
 This is the seventh time in Test cricket that Zaheer has dismissed Smith
 vanade or tii-20 main bhi jahir kaa shikaar bane hai smith
 
 
 Apart from this, he has sent the South African captain to the pavilion once in six odis and once in T20
 smith ko test cricket main sarvaadhik aath baar newjiland ke kris martin ne out kiya he, lekin jahir ne unhen antarrashtriya cricket main sarvaadhik baar pavilion kii raah dikhaai
 Apart from Smith in Test cricket, Zaheer has also dismissed Matthew Hayden of Australia seven times but as far as all three formats are concerned, he got Smith out 14, Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara 11 and Sanath Jayasuriya and Hayden out ten times
 Have done 3 baar or smith ko kiya out to
 
 
 If Zaheer dismisses Smith 3 times in international cricket, then a unique record will be recorded in his name
 aisa karte hi bharat kii ore se kisi ek ballebaaj ko sabase zyada baar out karne vaale gendbaaj ban jaaenge jahir khan
 Currently, this record is named after Kapil Dev from India
 unhone westeindies ke desmund hens ko 16 baar out kiya
 At the same time, the record for dismissing a single batsman in international cricket the most times is in the name of West Indies Kurtley Ambrose, who sent Australia's Mark Waugh 21 times

 isko lekar tamaam kaaryakartaaon ne jab sawaal uthaae to sisodiya ne unhen sambodhan ke liye aamantrit kiya, lekin kumaar vishwaas ne philhal sambodhan se inkaar kar diya
 According to the agenda present with 'aaj Tak', many important issues were to be discussed in the meeting which ran from 9 am to 5 pm, but Kumar was completely sideline in the agenda sent by the party

 When Kumar Vishwas entered the National Council meeting, many activists questioned why Kumar Vishwas was not named in the list of speakers
 desh bhar se aae tamaam kaaryakarta iske samarthan main bolne lage
 Manish Sisodia, the Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi, who is conducting the program, said that of course he can make his address and he invited Kumar to speak on stage
 lekin kumaar vishwaas ne is aamantran ko asweekaar karte hue kaha ki philhal agar unka naam nahin he to koi baat nahin, vah baad main jarurat padi to kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karenge

 is bich notebandi ne bharat par kaaphi gaharaa asar daalaa he
 Know further how demonetisation has changed India and how it has affected the Indian economy
 isliye laai notebandinotbandilane kii modi sarkaar ne kai vajahen bataai hai
 Several reasons have been enumerated to eradicate black money, eliminate fake currency present in circulation, promote cashless economy including terrorism and curb Naxal activities
 notebandi ke baad itnaa paisa lautaa banking system mennotebandike baad 1
 1 in 48 lakh bank accounts
 48 lakh karod rupee jamaa kiye gaye
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley gave this information in the Parliament
 unhone bataaya ki inamen se har khate main kam se kam 80 lakh rupee jamaa kiye gaye the
 1
 48 lakh bank khaaton main ausat diposit 3
 3 crore rupees
 do tihaai band note waapas aechoti dipositski baat karen, to 2 lakh rupee se lekar 80 lakh rupee tak isamen shaamil kiye gaye hai
 About 1
 09 karod bank khaaton main is daayre main rakam jamaa kii gai
 The average deposit in these accounts was Rs 5 lakh
 ek anumaan ke mutabik notebandi ke baad band noton kaa do tihaai bhaag waapas banking system main lautaa he
 In August, the Reserve Bank of India reported that 15
 3 lakh karod rupee kii vailu vaale band note waapas banking system main laute hai
 This means 99 percent of the closed notes returned to the banking system by 30 June
 isko lekar kuch samikshakon kaa kahana he ki jab sara paisa waapas bainkon main laut gaya he, to aise main sarkaar kaledhan ko pakadaney main kaamyaab nahin rahi he
 Returning all the money to the bank means that the government has not been successful in catching black money
 kaledhan ke khilaaf ladyeemodi sarkaar kaa daawa he ki notebandi ne kaledhan par kadaa prahaar kiya he
 Addressing a rally in Himachal Pradesh, PM Modi said that out of 3 lakh companies closed after demonetisation, 5 thousand companies have been found to have Rs 4000 crore from bank accounts
 corporate maamalon ke mantralay ne shuruaati jaanch ke aadhaar par kuch aankade pesh kiye hai
 According to the ministry, according to the data received from 56 banks, 17,000 crore deposits were withdrawn after demonetisation in 58000 bank accounts of 35000 companies
 is dauraan sarkaar ne kai shell companiyon kaa pataa lagane kii baat bhi kahi he
 Bhalla's claim, successful in capturing the demonetization black money: Surjit Bhalla, an economist and member of the Committee on Economic Affairs, estimates that almost all the black money has come after demonetisation
 isse sarkaar ko pehle saal main 2
 5 lakh crore will be revenue
 iske baad aane vaale kuch saalon tak centre ko isaki vajah se 1
 5 lakh crores will be additional earnings
 nakli noton par kya rahaa asaub tak maujuuda record bataata he ki is morche par notebandi safal nahin rahi he
 According to a report this year, out of the closed notes of 1000 rupees returned to the banks, only 0
 0007 fisadi hi nakli note the
 Talk of a closed 500 rupee note, so only 0 in it
 002 fisadi nakli note rahe
 At the same time, according to the National Investigation Agency, by 2015, fake notes worth Rs 400 crore were in circulation
 samikshakon kaa kahana he notebandi nakli noton ko bade str par pakadaney main naakaamayaab rahi he
 Digital payment has increased after digitization and demonetisation
 pements council of india ke mutabik notebandi ke baad cashles lenden kii raftaar 40 se 70 fisadi badi he
 Earlier this speed was at 20 to 50 percent
 bhale hi notebandi ke baad cashles lenden main badhottaree dekhne ko mili, lekin kuch maheenon baad hi isamen kami aane lagi or log phir nagdi par aa gaye
 But cashless transactions have started to decrease to 67 in November last year
 149 karod digital tranjaction hue the
 It increased to 95 in December
 750 karod par pahunch gaye
 However, by July this year, this figure has come down to 86
 238 karod par aa gaye
 According to records, RTGS and NEFT transfers increased by 6% and 20% respectively in 2016-17
 vruddhi dar par asarnotbandi kii ghoshnaa ke baad kii pehali timahi main jidipi vruddhi dar ghatakar 6
 Came to 1 percent
 pichley saal is dauraan yah 7
 Was at 9 percent
 iske baad april-june timahi main vrididh dar or bhi kam hui or yah 5
 Reached 7 percent
 pichley saal is dauraan yah 7
 1 percent
 haalanki philhal isko lekar sthiti saaf nahin he ki kya vruddhi dar ghatane ke peeche notebandi vajah he ki nahin
 GST is being considered to some extent for this
 naksal or aatankwaad par maranotbandi ko lagu karne ke dauraan yah bhi kaha gaya tha ki isse aatankwaad or naksali gatividhiyon par lagaam kasegi
 But even after one year, there is no concrete data that can tell how much ban on these activities is due to demonetisation
 kashmir main aatanki gatividhiyon main badhottaree hui he
 However, there is definitely a decrease in Naxalite activities
 6 maheenon ke intjaar se kuch nikaleganotbandi ko lekar jahaan kuch arthshaastri sakaaratmak rukh rakhte hai, to kai kaa maananaa he ki isse arthvyavastha ko nuksaan hua he
 International organizations have also said that the economy may have suffered in the short term due to the demonetisation, but in the long term it will be seen as an advantage
 surajeet bhalla kehete hai ki notebandi kaa asar dekhne ke liye 6 maheene or intjaar kar len
 During this time the data will come and it will be known whether demonetisation has passed or failed

 He wanders through every corner of the bank
 teen dinon tak wo chori ke tamaam sajo-saamaan ke saath-saath khaane-pine kii chijen lekar kai baar bank ke andar-baahar hota rahata he
 His eyes are on the millions of rupees in the Strong Room of the bank, but before his plot reaches the end, a twist in the story suddenly arrives
 aisi ajeeb chori naa to isse pehle kabhi kisi ne dekhi or naa hi suni
 One such theft in which the thief not only leisurely kept stealing in a bank for three whole days, but according to his needs, in these three days he sometimes went inside the bank and sometimes got out
 ek aisi chori jisamen chor naa sirf pechkas, hathaudaa or elactric kattar jaise sajo-saamaan lekar andar daakhil hua balki teen dinon ke is thakaaoo kaam par date rahane ke liye apane saath fal, sharaab or namakeen jaisi khaane-pine kii chizein bhi lekar lekar gaya
 a thief sneaks in at the Ordnance Factory branch of the State Bank of India at Muradnagar in Ghaziabad on Friday, 14 August at 9:30 pm
 chat main chhed kar wo pehle bank ke andar ghusata he or phir thodi der sustaane ke baad puure bank kaa jayja letaa he
 Actually, the target of the thief is the Strong Room of Parabank, which has kept millions of rupees
 lekin bank main chori karne se pehle se wo maahaul ko puri tarah bhaanp lenaa chahta he
 Since it is the night of 14 August, the thief has two more days to reach his intention
 15 agast ko swatantraaa diwas kii chuttee he jabaki 16 agast ko ravivaar he
 Now this thief spends the entire intervening night of August 14 and 15, wandering in the bank comfortably and trying to break the strong room
 is koshish main kabhi wo sisitivi main hathode ke saath najar aata he, kabhi electric kattar ke saath to kabhi kisi bakse ke saath
 But since it is not so easy to enter the Strong Room
 wo puure maahaul ko bhaanpane ke baad agle din yani 15 agast kii subah takreeban saadhe paanch baje bank se baahar nikal aata he
 This day, he stays away from the bank for the whole day, but the next day i
e
 on Sunday, August 16, at 5:30 in the morning, he again enters the bank
 chori ke liye puure ek din kaa vaktasomvaar 17 agast subah 10 baje bank khulne vaala he
 But there is a strange twist in the story everyday
 gajiabad ke state bank of india kii ordinance factory shakha main ghuse is chor ko ab takreeban do dinon kaa vakt guzar chukaa he
 This theft attempt, which started from the intervening night of 14 and 15 August, continues for the third consecutive day i
e
 on 16 August
 lekin wo pehle din kii tarah hi bank main khater-patar karne se pehle puri tarah mutmain ho lenaa chahta he
 So that no one knows about it inside
 lihaaja, wo din bhar to khamoshi se kaam karata he, lekin shaam hote hi ek baar phir hathode or electric kattar ke saath strong room main shuru ho jaataa he
 During this time he goes to the washroom, sometimes in another room to breathe open air and sometimes gets renewed in his work
 yahaan tak ki chori kii is koshish main ab uske kapade bhi kuch is kadar gande ho chuke hai
 It is seen that he is not stealing inside the bank, but is engaged in repairing a machine which is damaged in a workshop
 ravivaar 16 agast raat saadhe 10 bajedrasal, bank kii is shakha se sate atm centre main rupee nikaalane kii garaj se ek customer kii entry hoti he
 But during this time, on the other side of the ATM center, he sees a light burning inside the bank and sometimes extinguishing
 yahaan tak ki use itani der raat ko bank ke andar se khater-patar kii aawaaj sunai detii he
 Soon armed policemen surround the entire bank
 talaashi shuru kii jaati he or isi silsile main pulisavaalon ko bank kii chat par bana wo suraakh bhi najar aata he, jisase hokar chor andar ghusaa he
 Now the bank lock is opened by calling the manager and inside the thieves are arrested by red handed
 bank kaa strong room to khayr ab tak mahfuj he, lekin chor ke paas maujuud hathaudaa, kattar, pechkas, desi pistaul or khaane-pine kii tamaam chijen dekhakar police bhi hairaan rah jaati he
 But all his surprises end when the thief reveals his identity
 ejeeniyar niklaa chorbank main sendhamari or sendhamari ke jariye lakhon kii chori main jab gunahagaar ke chehre se nakaab hataa, to khud pulisavaale bhi chaunk gaye
 This thief was an electrical engineer, but the need of Rs 35 lakh turned him into a thief
 chehre mohare se nihaayat hi sharif or eemaandaar najar aane vaale janaab deepak mandarwaal par state bank of india kii shakha main sendhamari ke baad strong room todane kii koshish karne kaa iljaam he
 Actually, 37-year-old engineer Deepak used to contract with a company in Gurgaon
 usne apane is kaam ke liye kahin se 35 lakh rupee kaa karj liya tha, lekin apane dhandhe main hue nuksaan ke baad usne isaki bharpai ke liye sidhe bank main sendhamari karne kaa hi plan bana liya
 Deepak lives in Delhi these days
 lekin kuch saal pehle muradanagar main rahane ke dauraan wo naa sirf bank kii is shakha main aata-jaataa tha balki use ye bhi pataa tha ki ordinance factory kii shakha hone ke baavjood yahaan security aam taur par kam hi hoti he
 After this, he not only raked the bank for about ten days but also reached here with his car for burglary
 lekin isse pehle ki wo sendhamari kar apane ghate kii bharpai karata, uski pole khul gai

 centre or maharashtra kii endie sarkaar main sahyogi shivasena ne bhartiya janata party par ek baar phir se hamalaa bolaa he
 This time the Shiv Sena has put the Modi government in the dock with the Oxfam report
 shivasena ne apane mukhpatr saamana main kaha ki hindustan jald hi aarthik mahasatta banane vaala he
 Rumors of this kind have been frequently interjected earlier
 centre kii sarkaar kisi bhi dal kii ho, phir bhi aarthik kshetra main desh kaa graph kis tarah teji se bad rahaa he, yah baat bhujaaen fadakaakar kehane kii parampara hi ho gai he
 Shiv Sena said in an editorial in Saamana that no fruit of this so-called economic advancement falls in the bag of the common man
 iske kaaran desh kii janata is tarah kii pataakhaabaji karne waalon par til maatr bhi vishwaas nahin karti he
 Regardless of how much beating the drum bearers of economic development and all-round progress of the country, the truth is the opposite
 shivasena boli- oxfam kii report baichaiyn karne vaalishivasena ne kaha ki aarthik kshetra main kaary karne vaali pratishthit sanstha ‘oxfam’ kii vaarshik report ne ‘sabakaa vikaas’ ke daawey kii pole khol di he
 This report has put the truth before the world, the distance between the rich and poor of India is increasing rapidly
 yah report har samvedansheel insaan ko baichaiyn karne vaali he
 This report, which tells the real picture of India along with the world, has exposed the truth between rich and poor
 report main yah bhi kaha gaya ki hindustan kii kul sampatti main se 51
 Only one percent people own 53 percent
 saamana ke sampadakeey main kaha gaya ki desh ke 10 pratishat logon ke paas hindustan kii kul sampatti kaa 77
 4 percent share
 desh ke sirf ek pratishat amir logon kii tijori main desh ke aadhe se adhik logon kii sampatti padi he
 This oddity does not stop here
 jo ek pratishat amir varg he, unki sampatti main pichley ek varsh main pratidin 2 hajaar 200 karod rupee kii vruddhi hui he, jiske chalate salbhar main hindustan ke ye ‘kuber’ 39 pratishat or amir ban gaye
 In contrast, the wealth of the people who are economically weak has increased by only 3 percent
 ek ore amir, duusari ore wo garib jinako do vakt kaa niwala bhi naseeb naheensattarudh bhartiya janata party kii sahyogi shivasena ne kaha ki oxfam kii report main dikhaaya gaya ki ek taraf ek pratishat amir hai, to duusari taraf wo log, jinako do vakt kaa niwala bhi naseeb nahin hota
 Poor people living in villages, hamlets and urban slums have to struggle for bread

 aisi vishmata kii khai hone ke baavjood desh main sabase bada loktantr hone kii dingen haanki jaati hai
 'oxfam International' has pointed fingers at this asymmetry
 sattadhariyon ne badal diya loktantr kaa matlab: shivasenashivsena ne kaha ki ek ore ek pratishat amir or duusari ore baaki garib janata kii bhayankar vishmata hindustan kii saamaajik rachana or loktantr kii neenv ko khokhla karne vaali he
 Such a warning has been given by Oxfam
 kitaab main loktantr kii jo paribhaasha likhi gai he, usamen ‘logon dwaara, logon ke liye chalaae jane vaale janakalyankari rajya ko loktantr kaha gaya he
 This definition of democracy remained on paper
 sattadhariyon ne is paribhaasha ko bigadaa kar- 'mutthi bhar logon dwaara, mutthi bhar logon ke liye chalaaya jane vaala raaj yani loktantr'- kar diya
 The root cause of farmer suicides is that Oxfam presents its report every year on the inequality of the poor and the rich, studying the world economy
 iske pehle bhi isi tarah kii vishmata saamne ai he
 But with the view of reducing this inequality, there is no concrete plan to make the poor financially more efficient
 isiilie vishmata kii yah khai kam hone kii bajaay din-pratidin badhati ja rahi he
 Shiv Sena said that the root cause of suicide of farmers, unemployed and lower and middle classes of India is hidden in this inequality
 sookhe pattey kii tarah ud gaye achche din kii ghoshnaek pratishat dhanadhy logon ke paas desh se aadhe logon se adhik kii sampatti or baaki desh ke garibon ke gharon main nit daridrata kaa vaas hi hindustan kii vishmata kii bhayanak sachai ‘oxfam’ kii report darshaati he
 All the people of India should see this report and ask the question to the authorities, why is there so much inequality? Announcements like 'achhe Din' and 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' fly away like a dry leaf in front of such reports and power is being run for only one percent of the rich
 The question that arises is different

 The central government has clearly told the Bihar government to spend Rs 1,859 crore in the first state disaster fund to deal with the situation arising after the flood, only after that the central government will consider the type of assistance
 sutron ke mutabik kendriya grih rajyamantri kiran rigiju ne is vishay ko lekar bihar sarkaar ko centre ke yah paksh se avgat kara diya he
 The Union Minister of State for Home Affairs has also asked the Bihar government to send a Utilization Certificate of the amount spent from the State Disaster Fund

 In this letter, Nitish Kumar also mentioned how 31 districts have been affected by the floods in Bihar and crores have been lost
 mukhyamantri ne centre sarkaar se 4112 crores rupye kii sahaayta maangi thi
 Nitish Kumar was also angry that despite meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in August and informing him about the flood situation, the central team did not reach to assess the damage caused by the floods in Bihar till the first week of November

 centre kii taraf se madad nahin karne kaa aropbihar sarkaar ke aapadaa prabandhan mantri chandrashekhar ne kaha, 'centre sarkaar kaa ravaiya bihar ko lekar pakshpatpurna he
 The Center does not want to help Bihar in any way and that is why it delayed sending the central team to take stock of the floods

 In that era of Hindi literature, there was no division of entertaining poetry and serious poetry; Neither was there a competition between word-makers and artists in the name of entertainment to exploit the common man's distaste and illiteracy, which today we do not know how many forms are in front of us, nor to avoid public dialogue in an attempt to avoid this in poetry
 Trend
 harivansh raay bachchan usee kavy-yug ke sitara kavi rahe hai
 Harivansh Rai Bachchan not only communicated to his readers and listeners from the stage but also created records of popularity
 kavita kii sharton or kavi-rup main apane yug-dharm kaa nirvaah bhi kiya or jan se bhi jude rahe
 This Rachnavali is the most comprehensive presentation of his contribution

 *** Killing the truth today, truth has become so incomparable that it will be able to lead a lead in the truth, will not be ready to hear the truth; will blindfold, will also be able to get it out, will remain blind forever, will not see the truth; Will be able to hold hot, red, in fists, will not dare to touch the truth with fingers
 isliye chaaro taraf shadyantr hauske gale ko ghontne kaa,yaa ki us par dhul-paradaa daalane kaa,yaa ki usko khadaa, jinda gaadne kaa
 But they should not put on their success
 satya to baharoopiya he
 If they will bury the truth, it will not be able to dig through the earth, it will grow as a crop, which will feed the food revolutionaries
 satya par gar dhul-paradaa daal denge,vah hataa kar-faad kar ke nagn 
 The star will push Laz, attracting everyone's attention
 galaa ghontge agar uskakisi kavi-kanth main vah chatpataayegaa,nikalakar, geet banakarhruday main halchal machaayegaa
 *** Couples of adulteration are also advocates that we should have the right to say the truth and we are proud that our government's motto is that Satyameva Jayate! It is because of which we are maintaining various diseases, alcohol adulteration which causes reports of people getting sick, blind, dying often; in the name of life-giving medicines, we do not even know
 In Pdtaki we are drinking toxic sips, but, but, i would not even OBC pray that contaminants shout your lift both arms vertically got so Khtrnakjitna truth is a lie

 Not only the young ones, who have zeal in their hearts, there is heat in the blood and there is resentment in their raised eyebrows, even those of the old; what were they old! When Ravana --- ten head - twenty arms - Sita walked away Thaand Jatayu had fought him — alone — with beaks, with claws, with wings, then what was his age? Don't ask me, ask Valmiki

 The thing that has passed is gone! It was a safflower in life, you were always staring at it, it dried up and dried up; look at the chest of Madhuvan, how many of its buds are dry, how many flowers, which wither and then bloom; Flowers but Madhuvan makes a noise! what has passed is gone! It was the cup of honey in life, you had given up your mind, it broke if it broke; Look at the courtyard of the pub, how many cups move, fall into the soil Get together There are those who fall when they wake up, but say the broken cups, but the wine is repenting! The thing that has passed is gone! Made of soft clay, They spit honey, they have brought short life, they have broken the cups
 , Yet the consorts of the tavern are subdued, the sweet ones, those who are drunken, they loot the honey; the one who is a raw drinker, who cries on the mother-of-the-law, who cries out the burnt with true honey! Has had to sleep! *** Pustkbchcn Rcnavlilekk: aap jitne bhi hisaab lagaakar ghar main khaanaa bana len, rojaanaa kuch na kuch to batch hi jaataa hoga

 a sample of my thinking will be found at Dakbangla intersection, you will have a competition of playing the horn here, the loud shout will cross the traffic jam
 kis shahar main nahin he trephic jam, jab dilli jam he, ahmedabad jam he, mumbai jam he to dakbangla kyon na jam rahe
 The leaders have also jammed me like Dakbangla with their speeches

 Hey listen, my friend 
 
 
 Really, there are so many faces in the name of development to change me, i will no longer be what i am
 doctor fees kam kar denge, master koching main nahin skool main padhaayenge, meri garibi dur ho jaaegi, tata birla ambani adani bihari ho jaaenge

 The Maoists have plans to overthrow Indian democracy through armed struggle and want to control the government by 2050
 yah baat shuukravaar ko kendriya grih sachiv gopal krishna pillai ne kahi
 Addressing a seminar on 'left Wing Extremeism in India', Pillai said that Maoists are also likely to get the support of some ex-servicemen to carry out subversive activities
 unhone kaha, ‘bhartiya ganatantr ko vah kal yaa parason ukhaad phenkna nahin chaahate
 According to a booklet, his strategy is 2050 while according to some documents it is 2060
 ’ pillai ke anusaar naksali 2012 yaa 2013 ko apana lakshya banaakar nahin chal rahe
 It is a long slow plan and in the last 10 years they have carried out their activities gradually
 unhone kaha, ‘ab vah bhartiya arthvyavastha ke kai kshetron ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 But he does not want to do it now
 vah jaanate hai ki agar unhone aisa kiya to un par kadi karrwai hogi
 He is not fully prepared to face the country's strength
 isliye vah dhire-dhire chal rahe hai
 The Home Secretary said that the Maoists are well trained and committed like any other army and it is feared that some ex-servicemen are helping them
 unhone kaha, ‘vah kaaphi patibaddh hai, ucch prashikshit hai
 i believe some ex-servicemen or some people are with him
 ’ iske liye kaaran bataate hue pillai ne kaha ki koi hamalaa shuru karne se pehle naksalwadi puure abhiyaan kaa vishleshan karte hai
 He said, 'he analyzes it after each attack
 vishleshan kisi desh kii sashastr sena ke str kaa hota he
 The Home Secretary said that 908 people lost their lives in the Naxalite violence last year, which is the highest since 1971 and it may be more this year or less next year

 goli se biker kii maut ke peeche police jo kahani suna rahi he, usamen kuch jhol hai
 Questions have started to be raised on the police story and all the claims-1
 pehla sawaal ye he ki jab police control room ko jaankaree mili ki itani badi taadaad main bikers rajdhani ke sabase samvedansheel ilaake main stant kar rahe hai, to sirf ek pisiar vine kyon gai, force kyon nahin bheji gayi?2
 How did such a large number of bikers reach the capital's most vips, while at night the police place pickets and barricades everywhere? Was there no attempt to stop these pickets, or was there no report to the police control room? 3
 lutian jone ke saaf-suthere ilaake main pathar kahaan se aae? bikers bike chalaa rahe the yaa pathar dhund rahe the, yaa phir bhaag rahe the
 Did they bring stones? Even stones have not been found scattered on the occasion

 There is still suspense over the number of bikers
 sutron kii maane to bikers kii sankhya 30 se 35 thi, jabaki police ke pravaktaa rajan bhagat ne khud kaha he ki kareeb dedh 100 se 200 bikers vahaan par maujuud the or hangaamaa kar rahe the
 However, the police have argued in its defense that the bullet was fired on the bike tire

 He claimed that Rs 2690 crore was recovered during his tenure as Chief Minister and out of this, Rs 1800 crore was passed on to the BJP leadership
 haalanki NDTV is document kii pushti nahin karata he
 The Congress leader questioned, "is it not true that Yeddyurappa has been given money by bjp's top leadership?"

 On the caste, not on the button, press the button on the hand, the Congress has been playing every card of caste and religion to return to power after 27 years in UP
 pehle brahman siem ummidavaar shila dikshit kaa daanv, phir prachaar samiti kaa adhyaksh sanjay singh ko banaakar rajput card, or ab most becoward class(embisi) par daanv lagane kii taiyaari he
 In fact, the Congress feels that a large section of the Yadavs in the OBC will be with the SP, so it decided to cast a blank on the castes other than the Yadavs in the OBC
 ranneeti ke tahtarahul gandhi pehle dilli main obisi main aane vaale embisi netaaon se mulaakaat kii, unki maange suni, jiske baad hi tay ho gaya ki party is mudde kaa siyaasi istemaal jor-shor se karne vaali he
 Now that is exactly what has happened, the Congress has prepared posters to be fielded in this regard, which will be massed and publicized on social media
 poster main sonia gandhi ke saath rahul gandhi or shila dikshit hai
 The poster promises that 27 per cent backward classes have got reservation in UP, but the backward classes have not benefited from it, so if the Congress comes to power, it will make a separate quota for MBC within the OBC quota
 party ke salaahkaar prashanth kishor kii taraf se di gai jaankaree main ye kaha gaya he ki ye mudda congress kii menifeston main shaamil hoga or congress agar satta main aati he to wo rajya ke ati pichhadon ko us 27 pratishat aarakshan ke bheetar alag se aarakshan degi jise pichhadi jatiyon ke liye rakhaa gaya he
 Within this quota, separate arrangements will be made for the backward castes
 haalanki, congress netaa pramod tiwari ise jatvaad kii raajnneeti nahin maanate
 He says that the Congress talks for the help of the poor, farmers and the underprivileged and for the same purpose is talking about the right of the extremely backward class
 gauratlab he ki bihar sahit kareeb 10 rajyon main aisi vyavastha he jahaan rajya sarkaron ne pichhadi jatiyon ke cote ke bheetar ati pichhadi jatiyon kii pahchaan kar unhen alag se aarakshan diya he
 In Bihar, Nitish Kumar has also taken full electoral advantage by implementing this reservation system in panchayat and civic elections
 bihar main ye karpuri formula ke taur par janaa jaataa he jahaan ye kareeb teen dashak se lagu he
 In view of the success of Nitish Kumar in Bihar model, the Congress is preparing to redeem the same formula in UP
 bihar main pichhadi jatiyon main ati pichhadi jatiyaan or daliton main mahadalit banaae gaye jinka nitish kumaar ko bharpoor chunavi phayda mila
 The Congress has said that in Maharashtra and Karnataka in the 80s, the Congress had provided similar reservation where quota of backward castes has been given to the most backward castes
 vahiin formala ab congress ab uttar pradesh main aajmaana chaahati he
 The Congress, which has been struggling with the lack of issues for a long time, has got this big issue in which the Congress is trying to unite all the backward castes of Uttar Pradesh, which are currently angry with the Samajwadi Party and can take the bjp's stand
 Huh
 congress ko lagata he ki wo aarakshan ke bahaane un tamaam ati pichhadi jatiyon ko apane paale main kar sakati he jo samaajawaadee party main chal rahe yadavvaad se naaraaz he
 Rahul Gandhi first talked about the farmers, now Rahul Gandhi will woo the most backward castes of the state, the party feels that with the help of these issues, it can cross the electoral wart
 bhartiya nausena samudri tatarekha se sudur ilaakon tak apni damdaar upasthiti ke liye rus se kharide hue apane ekmaatr ladaaku jet mig-29ke par kaaphi had tak nirbhar he
 But according to the Control and Auditor General (CAG), its condition is so bad that it is not really available for use
 is sambandh main do din pehle kaig ne apni report sansad main pesh kii he
 The report has been submitted after auditing the Navy's mig-29 program
 usamen kaig ne kaha he, ''multi role or nausena bede ke air dephence kaa ahm hissaa mig-29ke samasyaon se grasit he
 "its engine has many problems including faults
 iskaa matlab he ki ''jab bhi ise tainaat kiye jane kii jarurat hogi to behatar se behatar sthiti main bhi opareshnon ke liye 50 pratishat se bhi kam maamalon ke liye hi yah puri tarah feet rahegaa
 '' ullekhneey he ki bharat ne 2004-10 ke dauraan is tarah ke 45 ladaaku vimaanon ko kharida tha
 It is deployed on the country's major warship INS Vikrant
 kochi main nirmit ho rahe vimanavahak pot vikrant kaa bhi yah mukhya ladaaku vimaan hoga
 There is also the possibility that it will also be the main fighter aircraft of Vishal, the third aircraft carrier at design level
 kaig kii report kahati he ki 2010 main jab se mig-29ke vimaan seva main shaamil kiye gaye hai, tab se inamen se aadhe ke injanon main dizin sambandhi khamiyaan pai gai hai
 Due to this its safe flight is a serious issue
 iske alaava vimanavahak pot ke sankare deck par utarane kii prakriya ke dauraan bhi yah puri tarah se sahaj nahin he
 During this time also it has been seen facing many problems
 iske saath hi kaig report main yah joda gaya he ki "dizin main anek sanshodhano or sudhaaron ke baavjood kai khamiyaan pai gai hai
 "due to the frequent emergence of these flaws, the training program of 'naval pilots' has been badly affected
 ' Senior naval officers while talking to NDTV have acknowledged that there is no immediate solution to this
 unka yah bhi kahana he ki mig-29ke vikalp kii kharid par bhi bahut kehane kii sthiti main nahin hai kyonki isaki kharid ek 'package deal' kaa hissaa thi jisamen vimanavahak pot gorshkove ke hastantaran or naveekaran kii yojana bhi shaamil thi
 Gorshkov has been included by the Navy in its fleet as INS Vikramaditya
 tippaniyan He also says that when it was not deployed on the aircraft carrier, a team of engineers from the Russian manufacturer was sent to its base in Goa to address technical problems

 However, sources in the Indian Navy hesitantly say that the Russians will undoubtedly benefit from the Indian experience of improving and improving recurring problems
 is sambandh main do din pehle kaig ne apni report sansad main pesh kii he
 The report has been submitted after auditing the Navy's mig-29 program
 usamen kaig ne kaha he, ''multi role or nausena bede ke air dephence kaa ahm hissaa mig-29ke samasyaon se grasit he
 "its engine has many problems including faults
 iskaa matlab he ki ''jab bhi ise tainaat kiye jane kii jarurat hogi to behatar se behatar sthiti main bhi opareshnon ke liye 50 pratishat se bhi kam maamalon ke liye hi yah puri tarah feet rahegaa
 '' ullekhneey he ki bharat ne 2004-10 ke dauraan is tarah ke 45 ladaaku vimaanon ko kharida tha
 It is deployed on the country's major warship INS Vikrant
 kochi main nirmit ho rahe vimanavahak pot vikrant kaa bhi yah mukhya ladaaku vimaan hoga
 There is also the possibility that it will also be the main fighter aircraft of Vishal, the third aircraft carrier at design level
 kaig kii report kahati he ki 2010 main jab se mig-29ke vimaan seva main shaamil kiye gaye hai, tab se inamen se aadhe ke injanon main dizin sambandhi khamiyaan pai gai hai
 Due to this its safe flight is a serious issue
 iske alaava vimanavahak pot ke sankare deck par utarane kii prakriya ke dauraan bhi yah puri tarah se sahaj nahin he
 During this time also it has been seen facing many problems
 iske saath hi kaig report main yah joda gaya he ki "dizin main anek sanshodhano or sudhaaron ke baavjood kai khamiyaan pai gai hai
 "due to the frequent emergence of these flaws, the training program of 'naval pilots' has been badly affected
 ' Senior naval officers while talking to NDTV have acknowledged that there is no immediate solution to this
 unka yah bhi kahana he ki mig-29ke vikalp kii kharid par bhi bahut kehane kii sthiti main nahin hai kyonki isaki kharid ek 'package deal' kaa hissaa thi jisamen vimanavahak pot gorshkove ke hastantaran or naveekaran kii yojana bhi shaamil thi
 Gorshkov has been included by the Navy in its fleet as INS Vikramaditya
 tippaniyan He also says that when it was not deployed on the aircraft carrier, a team of engineers from the Russian manufacturer was sent to its base in Goa to address technical problems
 varisht adhikari is taraf bhi ishaara karte hai ki mig-29ke ko shaamil karne vaala bharat pehla oparator tha
 Even before the Russian Navy it was incorporated here
 yadhyapi unka yah bhi kahana he ki nae plateform kii dikkaton se nipatane main samay lagata he lekin iske liye bahut chintit hone kii jarurat nahin he kyonki rus ne bhi apane sukhoi kii jagah isi mig-29ke ko bede main shaamil karne kaa faisla kiya he

 However, sources in the Indian Navy hesitantly say that the Russians will undoubtedly benefit from the Indian experience of improving and improving recurring problems
 NDTV se baat karte hue varisht nausena adhikariyon ne sweekaar kiya he ki iskaa taatkaalik koi samaadhaan najar nahin aata
 He also says that he is not in a position to say much on the purchase of the mig-29 option as its purchase was part of a 'package deal' which included plans for the transfer and renewal of the aircraft carrier Gorshkov
 gorshkove ko nausena ne ienes vikramaditya ke rup main apane bede main shaamil kiya he
 The comments unka yah bhi kahana he jab isko vimanavahak pot par tainaat nahin kiya gaya tha to goa main sthit iske base par roosi nirmaataa ke ejiniyaron kii ek team ko takneekee dikkaton kaa samaadhaan karne ke liye bheja gaya tha
 Senior officials also point out that India was the first operator to include the mig-29k
 yahaan tak ki roosi navy se bhi pehle ise yahaan shaamil kiya gaya
 Although he also says that it takes time to deal with the problems of the new platform but there is no need to be worried because Russia has also decided to include its mig-29k in its fleet instead of Sukhoi
 haalanki bhartiya nausena ke sutara hichkichaate hue yah bhi kehete hai ki barambar hone vaali dikkaton ko sudhaarney or ise behatar karne ke bhartiya anubhavon se beshak roosi bhi labhanvit honge
 He also says that when it was not deployed on the aircraft carrier, a team of engineers from the Russian manufacturer was sent to its base in Goa to address technical problems

 daastaa ke daur main khaadi bharat kii aatmanirbharta or aazaadee kii tamanna kii pratik thi
 When independence came, Khadi became iconic as Netaji's dress
 or ikkisvin sadi ke duusare dashak main pradhanmantri narendra modi ise ek aise khantee bhartiya brands ke rup main duniya ke saamne pesh karnaa chaahate hai, jiskaa koi sani na ho
 With this third initiative, where India's small scale industry will get a big market, there will be spread of Indianness in the world
 lekin desh main khaadi kaa thekedaar khaadi or gramodyog ayog (keviisi) kya iske liye taiyaar he? khaadi ko brands ke rup main viksit karnaa to dur, ayog ne pichley ek dashak se trademark registershan or navinikaran main aisi laaparvaahee dikhaai he ki khaadi kaa brands sikudta hi gaya
 On January 30, on the occasion of the 67th anniversary of the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi, when India Today took stock of Khadi's health, it appeared to be studying itself
 trademark karyaalay se praapt dastavejon ke mutabik, ayog ke khaadi se jude 40 se zyada trademark pichley 10 saal main rineu na karaae jane ke kaaran apni vaidhata kho chuke hai
 The termination of the validity of the trademark means that any person or entity is now free to sell the product under that name or can initiate the process of registering its name on that trademark
 alam yah he ki aaj conot place main khaadi ke sabase bhavy showrooms ke baahar ‘khaadi-bharat, khaadi-india’ kaa jo trademark laga he, uski vaidhata bhi khatm ho chuki he
 That is, Khadi is living in the country with a face that is no longer living in reality
 trademark karyaalay ke dastavej ke mutabik, yah trademark label 7 march, 2013 tak ke liye hi rineu kiya gaya tha
 After this, the period for renewing it by paying penalty fee has also ended on March 7, 2014
 trademark karyaalay ke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya, “khaadi gramodyog bhale hi is label kaa istemaal kar rahaa he, lekin kanoonee rup se philhal is par uskaa purna adhikaar nahin he
 The Commission will now have to do the same exercise to protect the trademark as it does for registering a new trademark
 ” duusari baat yah he ki ek naam kaa trademark kai shreniyon main register ho saktaa he
 In that case the names are technically separate trademarks even though they are one
 khaadi-bharat naam ke aise zyaadaatar trademark apni vaidhata kho chuke hai
 In addition, more than 40 trademarks registered under the names Khadi, Khadi Gramodyog, Preikon and Kutir have lost their validity
 ayog ke siio tathaa madhyam or laghu udyog mantralay ke sanyukt sachiv bi
 H
 anil kumaar ayog kaa bachaav karte hue kehete hai, “khaadi, khaadi india, sarvoday or kutir trademark rineu kara liye gaye hai
 At the same time, an application has been made for 'khadi Bharat' and renewal of indigenous diet
 ” ve yah baat sweekaar karte hai ki ‘khaadi india’ ke rinuval ke baavjood “khaadi bharat” ke abhi tak rineu na hone ke kaaran ayog kaa flagship logo takneekee rup se adhuraa he
 Despite these claims, the Khadi and Cottage trademarks still appear in the list of lost legitimacy in the Trademark Office documents
 yahaan tak ke byore ke baad agar aap soch rahe hai ki khaadi ke kapadon ke brands par hi maar padi he, to aap thodaa galat hai
 In fact, with the abolition of these trademarks, a large market of village industry has also come out of the hands of the Commission or, say, Khadi
 ye trademark herbal utpaadon, jadi-booti, furniture, dari-kaaleen, shahad yaa anya aushadhiy tatv, saundarya prashaadhan or is tarah kii ek puri shrunkhlaa ke liye hi ’70 ke dashak main yaa usase pehle panjikrut karaae gaye the
 Had it been a private company, then in such a time, Khadi's credibility, government patronage, subsidies, lots of trademarks and monopoly in the market would have taken advantage of the factors
 lekin khaadi ke vastron ko chhod den to baaki sab utpaada buree tarah pichad gaye hai
 Rather today Baba Ramdev's Patanjali Sansthan and many big companies are beginning to establish a new reputation in such natural and rural industry related products
 takreeban apane har bhaashan main mahatma gandhi kaa zikr karne vaale samaajawaadee party ke rajyasabha saansad choudhary munwwar saleem tanj kasate hai, “aaj baba ramdev mantralay main jo prajentation dekar gramodyog ko badhaava dene kii baat kar rahe hai, agar khaadi gramodyog ke prabandhan ne itani kahili na dikhaai hoti to gramodyog usase kahin behatar pradarshan kar rahe hote
 “the situation is bad, the government is also accepting this fact
 26 november, 2014 ko loksabhaa main ek prashn ke jawaab main emsamai rajyamantri giriraaj singh ne sweekaar kiya ki keviisi ke 37 trademark ab astitv main nahin hai
 The government also admitted that eight trademarks have been registered in the country by the names Khadi Herbal Henna, Khadi Beedi number 803, Khadi, Khadir, Khadi Generating Industries, Khadika and Khadi Nirol
 agar antarrashtriya falak par najar daalen to duniya main yah brands le jane kaa khwab pehle hi tut chukaa he
 German company 'khadi natureproduct' is selling its herbal products under the Khadi trademark across Europe
 company ne apana trademark spain ke hormonigeshan in da internal market karyaalay main register karaayaa he
 The company has since acquired exclusive rights to sell products under the Khadi brand across Europe
 sarkaar ne sansad ko bataaya ki ab bharat ke paas yahi vikalp he ki vah german company ke trademark ko avaidh ghoshit karne kii arji daale
 For this work, the Commission has applied to the CMTR office through Swati Gramodyog Seva Sansthan, Kanpur
 anil kumaar ke mutabik, videsh main khaadi ke panjikaran ke teen maamle saamne aae hai
 Objection has been lodged by India in two
 kya ab sarkaar pichley 10 saal main ayog kaa sanchaalan karne vaale logon se poochhegi ki aakhir ve kyon sote rahe or baapu kii khaadi kaise pichhadati gai
 Was this carelessness taken so that private companies should benefit from it? Nach Baliye 9: star plus par aane walesho 'nach baliye 9' apane har episod main koi na koi dhamal jarur machaata he

 Our performance shows the figures
 gujarat main saamaajik or aarthik drushti se har kshetra ke andar vikaas jaruri he
 Growth above 10 per cent is a growth-oriented approach
 kal hi agency reating ne jo data relies kiya he, jo desh main bade rajya hai, usamen paanch saal se sirf ek hi rajya he- jisaki growth rate everej 10 fisadi he
 By doing social polarization in Gujarat will be a loss for the state, if the Congress walks on this path, then Gujarat will suffer even more
 congress ne kiye khokhale wadevittamantri ne congress ke ghoshnaptr ke bare main kaha ki congress ne jo 50 fisadi se adhik aarakshan kaa kiya he vah sanvaidhanik drushti se asambhav he, congress ke kuch vaayade vittiya drushti se puure nahin ho sakate hai
 The total revenue for Gujarat is 90 thousand crores, but the pressure on Gujarat will increase with the promise of Congress
 nahin ghataae petrol ke dakhrun jetali bole ki congress kaa vijan niraadhaar he, jo sambhav nahin ho saktaa he
 The Congress had said in 2008 that we will forgive the farmers' debt, in total, they gave only Rs 1156 crore to Gujarat in loan waiver
 haal hi main jab crude oil ke daam bade to centre ne rajyon se petrol-dijal par duty kam karne ko kaha, lekin congress shasit rajyon ne paisa kam karne se inkaar kiya
 The Finance Minister said that the Congress in its manifesto has said that the Central and State Government should carry forward the scheme
 mudra yojana ke tahat gujarat main kai lakh logon lone mila he
 The bjp's vision document is on how to take forward the momentum that we have grown here in the last year

 Input: IANS maharashtra main bijepi ne 139 pratyaashiyon kii 2 suchi jari keelist main khadse, prakaash mehta or vinod taavade nahinitesh rane ko bhi bijepi ne abtak nahin diya tiktamaharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav apane aakhri charan tak pahunch rahaa he
 Tomorrow is the last date for nomination, but even after two lists of candidates in the Bharatiya Janata Party, ticket distribution remains the center of discussion
 khaskar, party ke teen diggaj netaaon ekanath khadse, prakaash mehta or vinod taavade ko abtak tikat nahin die gaye hai
 Apart from these, Nitesh Rane, son of Rajya Sabha member Narayan Rane from BJP is also missing from both the BJP lists
 aise main charchaa is baat ko lekar zyada he ki aakhir bijepi ne apane in diggajon ko abtak list se kyon out rakhaa he
 Eknath Khadse, Prakash Mehta and Vinod Tawde are all senior BJP leaders
 2014 main bijepi kii sarkaar banane ke baad teenon netaaon ko mantrimandal main shaamil kiya gaya
 However, Eknath Khadse could not stay in the cabinet for much time and had to resign in 2016 after being named in the MIDC land scam
 iske baad khadse kai maukon par aise bayaan dete rahe jo party virdohi maane gaye
 Recently, he also defended NCP chief Sharad Pawar who came under the investigation of ED
 mana ja rahaa he ki bhrashtachar ke aarope ekanath khadse ke khilaaf gaye
 However, he has submitted his nomination, which may make it difficult for the BJP
 darasal, khadse muktainagar vidhansabha seat se vidhayak hai or is ilaake main unka varchasv he
 Compared to Khadse, BJP has no such face that can be fielded
 duusari taraf congress or ensipi yahaan kaaphi kamjor rahi he
 Perhaps this is the reason why BJP has not fielded any candidate on this seat so far
 sutron ke mutabik, charchaa ye he bhi he ki khadse kii jagah unki beti ko tikat dekar bijepi saamanjasy bana sakati he or khadse kii naaraazgi dur kar apni is majboot seat kii chunautiyon ko kam kar sakati he
 At the same time, when talking about Prakash Mehta, he too had to resign from the ministerial position after being accused of corruption
 mehta ghatkoper purv seat se vidhayak hai or abtak is seat par bhibijepi ne koi pratyaashee nahinutara he
 This assembly constituency is considered a BJP stronghold
 lihaaja, yah seat bijepi ke liye kam chunauteepurn maani jaati he
 In such a situation, it is believed that the BJP can take a tough decision against Prakash Mehta by following the principle of zero tolerance against corruption
 vinod taavade ko dena chaahati he sandeshvinod taavade bijepi ke varisht netaa hai or fadanvis cabinet main mantri hai
 Tawde is an MLA from Borivali seat
 mukhyamantri kii res main jab netaaon kaa zikr hota he, to taavade ke naam kii charchaa kii jaati he
 His ambition is also talked about in political circles
 bataaya jaataa he ki party haikaman bhi unke naam se judi in charchaaon se naakhush he
 The Borivali seat on the other hand is one of the safest seats for the BJP
 yah wo seat hai, jahaan bijepi 1980 se hi kabhi nahin haari he
 In such a situation, it will not be difficult for the BJP to play a bet in place of Vinod Tawde
 haalanki, abhi tak is seat par pratyaashee kii ghoshnaa nahin kii gai he
 So, after coming two lists, if Tawde is given a ticket from here, it will be a big message for him
 nitesh kii raah main roda bani shivasenacongress chhodkar apni party banane vaale narayan rane philhal bijepi ke tikat par rajyasabha main hai or wo apane bete nitesh rane ke liye bijepi kaa tikat chaahate hai
 On Wednesday, he himself claimed that Nitesh would be given a ticket from Kankavali in the second list, but he was not given a place in the bjp's second list
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki shivasena kaa virodh nitesh rane par baari pad rahaa he, kyonki party is baat par adig he ki is seat se nitesh rane ko mauka nahin diya jaae
 CM Fadnavis has also said that the decision will be taken only after talks with Shiv Sena
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki abtak nitesh rane kaa naam bhi atka hua he
 However, the last date for nomination is 4 October
 aise main is baat kii sambhaavna he ki aaj shaam tak baaki siton par bhi pratyaashiyon ke naam ghoshit kar die jaaenge, jiske baad tasviir puri tarah spasht ho jaaegi ki in bade chehron par party phir se bharosa karti he yaa koi or rasta apanaati he

 The trailer of Hidden Raj! Padmavati in Vid laranvirtrailer Time was released on October 9 at 13:03 pm
 relies kaa ye samay rakhe jane ke peeche bhi ek khaas vajah thi
 Actually, the date of 1303 AD is a witness to the battle between Raja Rawal Ratna Singh and Alauddin Khalij
 kahani kii is khaas ghatana ko jis creative andaaj se trailor jari karne ke samay ke saath joda gaya he isse saaf he ki trailor main aise kai raaj hai, jo disambar tak film kii phantasy ko or badha sakate hai
 There was a debate on Deepika's unibro in Padmavati, Trend Banega was not a unique look, making Padmavati has been a period of making period films in Bollywood for a long time
 darshakon kii jitani ruchi sanis, fiction besd filmon ke liye he utani hi dilchaspee unki itihaas ke rochak muddon par rahi he
 But making these historical drama films is probably not that easy for the directors
 kai saalon kii research ke jariye tathyon ko khangalkar use parde par utaarna apane aap main hi ek diarector ke liye badi chunauti he
 But in the meantime, if any controversy arises about the film, then the difficulties of the film's release increase even more, as happened with the film Padmavati
 ba-adab, ba-mulaahijaa hoshiyaar maharani 'padmavati' padhaar rahi hai
 
 
 In the controversy over the film, some communities raised questions about the portrayal of Rani Padmavati's life in the film
 rajasthan main padmavati kii shooting ke dauraan film kii kahani par vivaad hua
 Some organizations alleged that Padmavati's character was being tampered with

 Abhay Deol has on the social media in the past taunted the stars who appear in advertisements for Fairness Cream for money
 ab bollywood star ranbir kapur ne ferenes kriim kaa vigyaapan thukraa diya he
 According to the news of Spot Boy, Ranbir Kapoor was recently offered an ad for about Rs 9 crore from a fairness cream company, which was rejected by Ranbir
 saal 2011 main bhi abhinayta ranbir kapur ne ferenes kriim kaa aid karne se manaa kar diya tha
 Ranbir believes that such products promote race in our minds
 kuch samay pehle kangana ranot ko ek ferenes kriim ko andarse karne ke liye bhi 2 karod rupee ofer hue the
 But Kangana refused to do it
 unhone ek intervyuu main bataaya tha ki bachapan se hi unhen ye gora dikhne kaa concept samaj nahin aata he
 Why this Pakistani actress added Ranbir Kapoor in front of actor recently, actor Abhay Deol has targeted celebs appearing in Fairness Cream
 unke hisaab se ferenes kriim ke aids main najar aane vaale star ek gaiyr-jimmedaar naagarik hai, jo aise desh main in aids ko badhaava de rahen jahaan gore rang ko lekar logon kaa junun kisi se chipa nahin hai
 Abhay that of course everyone will agree with this
 sabase dukh ki baat he ki india main gori rangath ko safalataa kaa ek paimaana mana jaataa he
 But Abhay is not the first actor to have trouble with such ads
 bollywood main kai or celebs hai, jo in aids kaa hisse banane se manaa kar chuke hai
 It includes Taapsee, Randeep Hooda, Swara Bhaskar, Nandita Das

 iske alaava is kanoon kii sarvocchata adivaasiyon ke gusse or 'aitihaasik anyaa' ko dur karne ke liye laae gaye vanadhikaar kanoon ke tahat mili unke paaramparik adhikaron se unhen vanchit karti he
 Through the Indian Forest Act 1927 (IFA), the colonial government tried to gain maximum power over forest resources
 ab is naye kanoon ke madhyam se centre sarkaar usase bhi aage jaakar apane adhikaron ko majboot karnaa chaahati he
 This bill will replace the Indian Forest Act 1927
 naukarshahi kii badi bhoomikaais vidheyak kaa masauda sanyukt van prabandhan samiti (JFMC) ke madhyam se 'gramin wanon' kaa prabandhan forest beuroperesi ko detaa he
 Although the concept of rural forest exists in the original IFA, the FRA repealed all existing laws in identifying forestland communities' rights over forest land and forest resources
 vanavaasiyon kii gram sabha ke madhyam se wanon kaa sangrakshan or prabandhan kaa adhikaar unhen saunpa gaya or is tarah JFMC ko gairajaruri bana diya
 It states that if any rural forest tribal community belongs, the use of timber and other forest produce, rights over pasture and conservation and management of these forests will be set in consultation with the 'forest Department
 (cloj 22)
 In addition, the Bill empowers forest bureaucracy to decide forest rights and the power to abolish individual and community rights by paying compensation to declare such forests to be 'reserved forests'
 cloj 26 main yah praavdhaan he ki arakshit van main aag lagane yaa van upaj kii chori yaa maweshiyon dwaara charne ke maamle main, charaagaah yaa van upaj ke sabhi adhikaar khatm kar die jaaenge
 Simultaneously, these provisions give the veto power to forest rights for forest bureaucracy to be abolished
 sashastr forest beuroperesi or kshatipurtine vidheyak main ek naye praavdhaan (cloj 66) ke tahat forest beuroperesi ko van aparaadh kii jaanch karne ke liye phid arms kaa upyog karne or andeh ke aadhaar par gram sabha ko suchit karke kisi bhi parisar main pravesh karne kii anumati di gai he
 Worse, the Bill gives bureaucracy unlimited powers under the Armed Forces (privileges) Act 1958, applicable to the 'disturbed areas' for the armed forces
 iske tahat agar ve koi jyaadati yaa galat kaam karte hai to yah kanoon unhen abhiyojan se suraksha detaa he
 No case can be prosecuted against forest officials without the prior permission of the state
 iske liye kisi kaaryakari magistrate dwaara jaanch ke liye sashart anumati di jaaegi
 The bill states that bureaucracy is being given this protection 'to prevent forest crime'
 yah visheshadhikaar kuch vishesh prakaar ke lok sevakon jaise nyaayadhishon or sashastr bal karmiyon ke liye siarpisi kii dhara 197 ke tahat nirdhaarit suraksha ke atirikt hoga
 Under Clause 11 (3) empowers the Forest Settlement Officer to act as 'collector' under the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 for acquiring forest land
 iske alaava, cloj 84 kahata he ki is tarah ke adhigrahan ko 'saarvajanik uddeshy ke liye aavashyak samajha jayega
 'however, this public purpose is nowhere defined
 adivaasiyon ko or kamjor kiyakloj 66 ek forest apradhi yani van ke prati koi aparaadh karne vaale ko aatankwaadi kii tarah maanata he
 This law puts the burden on the accused to prove himself innocent
 jabaki baaki maamalon main maujuuda aapraadhik kanoon abhiyojan par aparaadh sabit karne kaa dabaav daalata he
 This law blames that person's faults, other than that of the entire 'vanvasi community' or the organization legally registered in the state, but provides no explanation
 yahaan tak ki yah kanoon rajya sarkaar ko kisi par darj cese waapas lene kaa adhikaar bhi nahin detaa
 (forest cases were transferred to concurrent list in 1976)
 yah adhikaar sirf centre sarkaar ko hoga
 The draft of the bill states that state governments withdraw cases registered for political gains
 is par ankush lagaaya janaa chahie kyonki iske parinaam vinaashkari ho sakate hai
 Such resilience is the cause of destruction of forest area
 centre sarkaar ke paas rajyon ke adhikaron ko khatm karne or van prabandhan main hastkshep karne kii bhi shakti hogi or is sambandh main zyaadaatar aparaadhon ko gairajamaanti bana diya gaya he
 Fear of experts Prof
 and law teacher who works for tribal rights
 shridhar aacharyulu kehete hai ki yah vidheyak vanavaasiyon ko shashakt banane ke bajaay forest beuroperesi kii shaktiyon ko badhaata he or is tarah FRA ne jo adhikaar die the, use yah chhinta he
 Forest bureaucracy will have the right to identify and recognize forest rights
 yah gram sabha or anya (jila or up-jila str) samitiyon ke adhikaron or bhoomikaaon ke maddenjar puri tarah se virodhabhasi he
 He wonders, "forrest bureaucracy is the real reason behind the years old land problems and this is the real villain
 unki shakti ko or krur bana diya gaya he
 Now what benefits will the tribals be able to take? ”kanchi Kohli, Center for Policy Research, says the bill exemplifies the historical quarrel over how and by whom forests should be governed
 ve kahati hai, 'van adhikaar adhinium aitihaasik rup se alag-thalag pad chuke adhikaron ko manyata dene ke liye laayaa gaya tha
 The FRA was also an attempt to create space for community-based conservation
 yah masauda van vibhaag ke niyantran ko phir se hasil karne kaa ek prayaas he
 While this may be appropriate in cases of misuse, its generalization would make the democratic forest administration given by the FRA as it was before
 'vidambnaa yah he ki vidheyak kii prastaavna main vanavaasiyon ke sangrakshan or kalyaan ke liye logon kii bhagidaari kii baat bhi kahi gai he
 The Bill also supports meeting the aspirations and international commitments of development at the national level and strengthening forest-based traditional knowledge for its broader objectives

 But now gradually, the families of the deceased farmers have started to meet and provide relief to them

 Following the inauguration of the refinery at Paradip on 7 February, Modi's arrival at Bargarh on 21 February has become a headache for the Naveen Patnaik government of Odisha
 haalanki naveen ne pashchim odisha ke kisaanon ke liye 35,000 karod ru
 The package was announced but till now the government has been denying the suicides of so many farmers due to drought and debt
 krishi mantri pradeep maharathi kehete hai, ''jiladhikariyon se mangai gai report ke mutabik, aatmahatya kii vajah sookhaa or karj na hokar unki nijee samasyaayein hai
 Even after this, the government is investigating that relief and rehabilitation assistance should be given to the districts where such incidents have taken place
 ''modi kii kisaan raily ke jawaab main naveen patnayak ke ranneetikaron ne bhi aanan-fanan main unki reliyon kii yojana bana daali
 Before Modi's rally, on February 18, Naveen Patnaik will visit Balangir and Kalahandi, adjoining districts of Bargarh
 pashchimi odisha main achaanak tej hui rajnatik gatividhiyon ke peeche ek kaaran yah bhi he ki 2017 main panchayat chunaav hone vaale hai
 In these, the BJP has to prepare its political ground, then the challenge is to save its land in front of Naveen

 Congress too is not behind in this stance
 pradesh congress ne kisaan aatmahatya par ek shwet patr jari kiya he, jisamen 133 kisaanon kii aatmahatya ke aankade die gaye hai
 But the government is denying these figures outright
 varisht patrkaar kaanan das kehete hai, ''naveen sarkaar kisaan aatmahatya or rashancard ghotaale se sahami hui he
 He fears that his ready-made mass base may not slip
 '' lekin das kaa maananaa he ki haal-philhal main aisa hota lagata to nahin he kyonki naveen patnayak kaa bipiel vot bank jabardast he
 It is not easy for any party to break into this vote bank
 duusari taraf modi or unke mantriyon ke lagaataar ho rahe odisha daure se bijd netaa bhi sakapakaae hue hai
 BJP also feels that if it can increase its base till the panchayat elections, it will be an achievement
 bijepi netaa bijd sarkaar ke prati zyada aakraamak nahin hai
 One reason for this is that the passing of Bills at the Center may require the assistance of BJD mps in the Rajya Sabha

 He gave Rs 21,600 crore to 36 lakh farmer families of the state
 pension (rajya bajet kaa 4 fisadi) dene kii maang ko lekar 18 farvari ko ek kisaan sammelan bulaayaa he
 Earlier, on February 17, 20,000 farmers from Cuttack would take a padyatra to Bhubaneswar
 sanghathan kaa kahana he ki rajya kii 70 fisadi aabaadi apni aajeevika ke liye khetibari par nirbhar he, lekin sarkaar unki ore se bilkul bekhbar he
 According to Ashok Pradhan, the convener of the farmers' organization, since June 2015, more than 200 farmers have committed suicide across the state
 inamen se 35 kisaan to sirf bargarh (congress ke shwetapatr or media ke mutabik 23) ke hai
 On the other hand, Chief Minister Patnaik has also taken important steps in this direction
 unhone kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali se sookhaa or karj peedit kisaanon ke liye 3,500 karod ru
 Has sought relief
 unhone krishi ke liye bajet main 10,900 karod ru
 Separately, it also provided for insurance of one lakh for farmers under Biju Krishak Kalyan Yojana

 Loan is given, which is very less
 ''odisha main lagbhag 70 lakh kisaan parivaar hai, jinamein se 60 fisadi khetihar majdoor hai
 80% of Odisha's agriculture is done by agricultural laborers
 haalanki sarkaar ne 1965 main khetihar kisaanon ke liye bhoomi sudhaar adhinium banaaya tha par yah lagu nahin ho paaya
 The Naveen Patnaik government had decided to amend this law in 2011, but it was also not implemented
 yadi yah kanoon lagu ho gaya to bantai par kheti karne vaale yani khetihar mazdooron ko vahi adhikaar mil jaaenge, jo aam kisaanon ko milte hai
 That is loan, benefit of insurance scheme

 " The budget session of the Delhi Legislative Assembly began in which lg's address was made
 jisamen sarkaar ne dilli ke bhavishya ke liye apana vijan bataaya jisko lekar bijepi ne ise 'sapana vijan' bataa diya
 Delhi BJP leader and Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Vijender Gupta said that the government whose chief minister is dreaming of making Delhi London and Paris in a year, has no vision for the future and especially for the year ahead
 
 abhibhaashan ko sunakar aisa laga ki aap sarkaar duusare rajyon ke chunaavon main itani vyast rahi ki use dilli ke liye kuch sochane kaa samay hi nahin mila
 Vijender Gupta, while taunting the Kejriwal government, gave the Lieutenant Governor's address just a summary of the publicity campaign being run by the government
 unhone kaha, aisa prathit hota he ki ise nigam chunaavon ko dekhte hue sarkaar dwaara taiyaar kiye gaye vigyapanon ko saamne rakhkar banaaya gaya ho
 It was a golden opportunity for the government to present its policies for the future, but the government lost it
 chunki dilli kii 99 pratishat aabaadi purvi, uttari or dakshini nagar nigamon ke kaaryakshetra main rahati he or in teenon nigamon kaa kshetrafal dilli ke kuch kshetrafal kaa 96 pratishat he
 Nevertheless, the Deputy Governor did not say anything about nurturing the municipal corporations from the economic and policy point of view
 vijendra gupta ne kaha ki unhen aashaa thi ki sarkaar nigamon ke aane vaale chunaavon ko dekhte hue unke liye koi nai yojanaayen lekar aegi
 After all, how can Delhi be made clean, clean and smart, but the government did not even mention the corporations
 aisa lagata he aane vaale samay main bhi sarkaar kaa nigamon ke prati sautela ravaiya hi rahane vaala he
 According to Vijender Gupta, more than one-third of Delhi's population lives in unauthorized colonies, slum clusters, rehabilitation settlements and slum cutters, but the government did not present any effective and comprehensive plan for the development of these areas through the Lieutenant Governor
 
 vijendra gupta ne kaha ki swaraj bajet tathaa mohall sabhaayen sarkaar kii drushti se ab ojhal ho chuki hai
 The promises made in the election manifesto have also faded
 aam aadmi canteen kholane kaa sapana ab tak saakaar nahin hua he
 In such a situation, it is futile to expect anything from the government
 vipaksh ke netaa ne kaha ki uparajyapal ke sambodhan main kuch bhi nayaa nahin he, schuli shiksha, ucch shiksha, swasthya, samaaj kalyaan, rain baseron, jal aapurti, avajal nishpaadan ityadi jaise moolbhoot masalon main sarkaar ne koi nayaa drushtikon nahin prastut kiya he
 Only some of the work done has been mentioned
 behatar yatri suvidhaon ke saath taiyaar kii gai nai humsafar express kaa railmantri suresh prabhu ne muyna kiya
 On the basis of the feedback received from passengers, the Railway Minister had suggested several changes in the coaches of Humsafar Express to the Modern Coach Factory
 railway ne asi 3 tear coach main kai anuthe badlaav kiye hai
 In the new Humsafar train, AC three-tier compartment, this time the toilet has nappy changing tables for urinals and children
 ye donon chijen bhartiya railway pehali baar in dibbon main de rahaa he
 Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu looked satisfied after seeing the new Humsafar train prepared at the modern coach factory in Rae Bareli
 unhone kaha ki bhartiya railway yatri suvidhaon ko or behatar karne par puraa jor de rahi he
 We have tried to provide better facilities in the coaches of New Humsafar Express
 unhone kaha ki asi thri tear coach main kiye gaye nae badlaav nishchit taur par logon kii yatra ko sukhad banaaenge
 GM of Modern Coach Factory Mahesh Kumar Gupta said that the biggest change in the new coach of AC Three Tier is the urinal fit in the toilet
 amuman train ke toilet main peshaab karne ke liye alag se urinal nahin hote hai
 Because of this people used to urinate on the toilet's commode
 isaki vajah se train ke toilet kaaphi gande ho jate hai
 This gives a big boost to the railway's image
 is samasya se nipatane ke lierelway ke toiletko neshnal institute of dizin ke paas ridizin karne ke liye bheja gaya tha
 The National Institute of Design suggested several changes in the railway toilet
 in badlaavon main bada badlaav railway ke toilet main urinal kaa set kiya janaa he
 Apart from this, separate tables have been installed in the railway toilet to change the children's nappies
 railway ke adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki aisa isliye kiya gaya he kyonki chote bachche ko lekar akeli safar kar rahi mahilaon ko toilet jane main kaaphi pareshaani hua karti thi
 In view of this, a nappy changer table has been installed in two toilets of one compartment to change the children's nappies
 iskaa phayda yah hoga ki koi bhi akeli mahila apane bachche kii nappy badalane ke liye inkaa istemaal kar sakati he
 At the same time, if she wants to go to the restroom, then she can also sit on the nappy changer seat with a seat belt tied securely

 It is feared that the businessmen are not showing their true turnover, due to which the government is getting less tax
 july se sitanbarke bich 10 lakh companiyon ne compojishan skim lee thi
 Under this scheme, the businessmen only have to share the turnover details of their company
 iske tahat tex ek tay rate par chukaaya jaataa he
 Out of these 10 lakhs, 6 lakh people have filed returns till 25 December
 teen maheenon ke dauraan kul rakam 251 karod rupee rahi he
 This leads to an annual turnover of up to Rs 8 lakh, while the government had estimated the average turnover to be Rs 2 lakh under this scheme
 ausat anumaan or ritern ke taur par saamne aa rahe turnover ke aadhaar par adhikari chintaa jataa rahe hai ki kahin is skim ke naam par sarkaar ko rajasav kaa nuksaan to nahin uthaanaa pad rahaa
 An official from the Times of India said that we were planning to increase the maximum limit under this scheme to more than 1 crore, but the average declaration shows that it has an annual turnover of Rs 8 lakh
 aise main ham ye soch rahe hai ki kya adhiktam seemaa badhaane kii bajrurat he bhi ki nahin
 Explain that in November, GST Council has set a maximum limit for composition scheme of 1
 5 karod rupee kar di he
 There has been apprehension in the government's mind that businessmen who take advantage of this scheme are deliberately not showing their turnover less
 isse sarkaar kaa rajasav kam ho rahaa he
 For this reason, the Ministry of Service has also decided to examine the limit fixed for filling the estimated tax under the Income Tax
 iske tahat salanaa aay kii seemaa badhaakar 2 karod kar di gai thi
 If you look at the figures, here too, the average annual income is coming to Rs 18 lakh
 aise main adhikari yahaan bhi ashanka jataa rahe hai ki skim kaa phayda lene vaale sahi reporting nahin kar rahe

 The Lokpal Bill, which has been stuck for a long time, is now on its way to become a reality
 sarkaar aaj loksabhaa main lokapal bill pesh karegi
 However, it is a shock for Anna Hazare and his team, who fought for an effective Lokpal, as the Prime Minister is kept out of the purview of the proposed Lokpal
 anna hazaare ke anshan or civil sosayadi se maathapai ke baad jo nichod niklaa, usase saaf ho gaya ki lokapal ab vaisaa hi hoga, jaisaa sansad chaahegi
 Now know what is in the Lokpal bill
 
 
 lokapal bill ke mutabik, agar koi locasevak apni sampatti chhipaata he yaa apni sampatti ke bare main galat soochna detaa he, to lokapal maanegaa ki locasevak ne bhrasht tareeke se sampatti kamai he
 - The work of mps in the Prime Minister, High Judiciary and Parliament will remain outside the purview of Lokpal
 - lokapal bhrashtachar ke aaropon se ghire loksevakon ke tabadale yaa nilamban kii sifarish kar saktaa he
 - The Ombudsman will in some cases bear the responsibility of the Civil Court
 - agar koi vyakti lokapal main juthi shikaayat darz karaata he, to lokapal use 2 se 5 saal tak qaid or nunatam 25 hazaar rupee jurmaana kii sazaa suna saktaa he
 Anna and his team are unhappy with this government ombudsman bill

 If this is the case, it will be strictly dealt with
 lekin ham sanchaar ke kshetra main hue vikaas ko bhi nazarandaaj nahin kar sakate
 "he stressed that in the last few years there has been unprecedented development in the field of communication across the country
 agar aankadon par yakeen kiya jaae to march, 2004 main gramin kshetron main telephone ghanatv 1
 55 percent, while it was 20 in the urban area

 disambar, 2010 main gramin kshetron main telephone kaa ghanatv 31
 Recorded 18 percent, while in urban areas it stood at 47 percent
 desh kaa kul telephone ghanatv badhkar 66 pratishat ho gaya
 This was possible only under the National Communications Policy, which does not have a provision for auction or bidding
 unhone kaha, "telecom niti pehle aao, pehle paao par aadhaarit he or isamen kuch galat nahin he
 The government followed this policy for the allocation of 2G spectrum licenses and this gave a big dividend to the government

 Later in the night, the President met the Union Ministers
