 In December 2018, the Congress conducted a survey among nearly 40,000 women in Karauli, Rajasthan to understand the modus operandi of casting their votes

 Ravi conducted a comparative study of the election results of 243 constituencies which showed that the winning party in 87 constituencies changed
 duusare lafjon main, pichley vijetaon main se 36 fisadi ko matadaataaon ne dhul chataa di
 With this, the 15-year rule of RJD came to an end and JD (U) emerged as the single largest party
 in aath maheenon main koi nai nitiyaan nahin ai thim
 Therefore, this change in the results can be understood by the presence of women voters in Bihar elections
 auraten vot dene ke liye zyada taadaad main nikalakar ain or duusari baar unhone pichley vijetaon ke khilaaf vot diya
 "nitish Kumar, who took over as chief minister after the election, recognized it immediately and has been very sensitive to the likes and dislikes of women voters and has been taking steps accordingly
 " tabhi se rajya main sharabbandi se lekar cycle tak unki kai yojanaon se aisa maaloom detaa he ki ve is 'vot bank' kii takat ko pahachaanate or maanate hai
 Ravi reveals another aspect of his study — the results also indicate that a jump in the number of female voters who voted has reduced the chances of a party being reelected, while the increase in the number of male voters The possibility of his re-election increased
 jab auraten apni ichha or swatantra dhang se vot daalati hai, tab ve dikhaati hai ki unke hit samaaj ke baaki aadhe hisse se alahada hai

 janata kii khushiyon main shaasha kii khushi nihit hoti he His welfare is his welfare jis baat se shaasha ko khushi hoti he vah use thik nahin samajhegaparantu jis kisi baat se janata khush hoti haishaasak use thik samajhegaa
 - Economics of Kautilya bhartiya rail is upmahadweep ke 7172 se adhik steshnon ko jodate hue pratidin 12617 gadiyon main 23 million se zyada yatriyon ko dhoti he
 This is equivalent to carrying the entire population of Australia daily
 ham 7421 se adhik malgadiyon main pratidin lagbhag 3 million ton maal dhote hai
 Madam Chairperson, With the availability of more than one billion tonnes of freight traffic, the Indian Railways have access to the select clubs of the trains of China, Russia and the United States, now i aim to emerge as the leading carrier in the world
 adhyaksh mahodaya, jaisaa aap jaanati hai, bhartiya rail, yatriyon ko dhone ke atirikt koyala bhi dhoti he
 It handles steel, it carries cement, it carries salt, it carries food grains and fodder and it also carries milk
 is prakaar, bhartiya rail vyaavhaarik rup se sabhi kii dhulaai karti he or yah kisi bhi vastu ko naa nahin karti he, basharte use maldibbe main dhoya ja saktaa ho
 Most importantly, we play an important role in the security of the nation by becoming the backbone of the supply chain of the defense organization
 adhyaksh mahodaya, haalanki ham pratidin 23 million yatriyon ko dhote hai lekin abhi bhi kaaphi janata aisi he jinhone abhi tak railgadee main pair tak nahin rakhaa he
 We ship more than one billion tonnes of freight traffic every year connecting industrial clusters with ports and mines but many interiors still await rail connectivity
 yadhyapi vigat varshon main maal yatayaat vyapaar nirantar bad rahaa he, bhartiya rail desh main sabhi sadhano se dhoe jane vaale kul maal yaatyaat kaa 31 pratishat ko hi dhoti he
 These are the challenges that we have to face
 vividh kism kii jimmedaariyaan nibhaane vaale is prakaar ke vishaal sanghathan se ek vanijyik udhyam ke rup main aamadani arjeet karne ke saath ek kalyankari sanghathan ke rup main bhi kaary karne kii ummid kii jaati he
 These two tasks are similar to the two tracks of the track, which, however, run concurrently but never meet
 abhi tak bhartiya rail in do virodhatmak uddeshyon main santulan banaate hue is kathin kaary ko nibhaati rahi he
 Social service liability in 2000-01, 9 of gross traffic receipts
 4 pratishat se badhkar 2010-11 main 16
 6 percent
 2012-13 main is prakaar kaa daayitv 20,000 karod ru
 Exceeded even more than that
 is varsh kaa kul nivesh arthath bajtiy sroton ke antargat yojana parivyay 35,241 karod ru
 Was
 is prakaar samaajik daayitv ke boj kii raashi bajtiy sroton ke antargat hamaare yojana parivyay ke aadhe se bhi zyada he
 Madam Speaker, any organization spending more than half of its plan outlay under budgetary sources on social obligations can hardly raise sufficient resources for its development work
 baharhaal, adhyaksh mahodaya, bhartiya rail apane saamaajik dayitvon ko puraa karti rahegi lekin kaarykushalta tathaa gaadi parichaalan kii sangraksha ke saath samjhauta kiye bina ek seemaa ke baad in do paraspar virdohi uddeshyon main santulan banaae rakhana sambhav nahin he
 We have 1 16 lakh kimi
 Total track length, 63,870 coaches, 2
 4 lakh se adhik maal dibbe or 13
 There are 1 lakh employees
 iske liye eendhan vetan or pension, railpath evam sawari dibba anurakshan or isse bhi adhik mahatvapurn sangraksha sambandhi kaary par kharch kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Most of our Arya expenditure on these works is due to traffic income
 varsh 2013-14 main sakal yatayaat aamadani 1,39,558 karod rupaye or kul sanchaalan va 1,30,321 karod tha, jiskaa parichaalan anupaat lagbhag 94 pratishat banataa he
 Madam Speaker, this shows that out of every rupee earned, we spend 94 paise on operations
 hamaare paas adhishesh ke rup chah paisa hi bachataa he
 Apart from this amount being reduced, there has been a continuous decline due to non-revision of fares
 anivaaryat: kiye jane vaale labhaansh or leez prabharon ke bhugtan ke baad varsh 2007-08 main yah adhishesh 11,754 karod rupaye tha or maujuuda varsh main 602 karod rupaye hone kaa anumaan he
 Madam Speaker, this very small surplus mobilized by the railways finances works to improve conservation, capacity enhancement, preservation, passenger services and amenities
 maatr chaalu pariyojnaon ke liye 5 lakh karod rupaye arthath prativarsh lagbhag 50,000 karod rupaye apekshit hai
 This makes a huge difference between the amount available as expected surplus
 yadpi is antar ko kaatane ke liye vivekpurna prayaas kiye jane chahie the, parantu jo tarriff niti apanaai gai usamen yuktisangat drutigon kii kami rahi
 Passenger fares were kept below cost and thus there was a loss in passenger vehicle operations
 yah haani badhati rahi jo 2000-01 ne prati paisanger kilometre 10 paise badhkar 2012-13 main 23 paise ho gai kyonki yatri kiraayon ko sadaiv kam rakhaa gaya
 Freight rates, on the other hand, have been increased from time to time and have been kept high to compensate for losses in the passenger sector
 parinamswaroop maal yatayaat nirantar railway se chhutata gaya
 The share of railways in the total freight traffic has steadily decreased in the last 30 years
 adhyaksh mahodaya, yah ullekhneey he ki kul maal yatayaat main railway kaa hissaa kam hona, rajasav ko haani hone jaisaa he
 Madam Speaker, after explaining how the revenue was lost, now i want to tell you how there is directionlessness in investment
 pariyojnaon ko puraa karne par jor die jane ke bajaay unhen sweekrut kar dene par dhyaan diya gaya
 a total of 676 projects worth Rs 1,57,883 crore were sanctioned during the last 30 years, out of which only 317 projects could be completed and the remaining 359 projects are yet to be completed, which are now 1,82,000 to be completed
 Crores will be required
 pichley 10 varshon main 60,000 karod rupay mulya kii 99 nai line pariyojnaon ko sweekrut kiya gaya, jisamen se aaj kii taarikh tak maatr ek pariyojna ko hi puraa kiya gaya he
 In fact there are 4 projects in it which are up to 30 years old but they have not been completed yet for some reason
 jitani adhik pariyojnaon ko ham isamen jod denge ham unke liye utana hi kam sansaadhan muhaiyaa kara paaenge or unhen puraa karne main utana samay bhi lagegaa
 If this trend was continued, i can say with certainty that more thousands of crores of rupees will be spent and it will hardly yield any returns
 adhyaksh mahodaya, bhartiya relon kii kabhi na samaapt hone vaali pariyojnaon ke bare main bataane ke baad ab main pariyojnaon kaa chayan karne main kis prakaar praathamikta di jaati he, uskaa ullekh karata hum
 In order to reduce congestion in highly saturated networks, railways receive funds from investments made for doubling and tripleting
 duusari ore nai linon kaa nirmaan karne se adhikanshat: parichaalanic laagat bhi puri praapt nahin hoti he, kyonki uske anuroop maang nahin hoti he
 In the last 10 years, Indian Railways has invested Rs 41,000 crore to lay 3738 km of new lines
 duusari ore isane 5050 kilometre ke doharikaran ke liye maatr 18,400 karod rupe hi kharch kiye
 However, it was a priority task to strengthen the system
 sanyog se, main bhartiya rail ke bare main kisi vyakti dwaara kahi gai nimnlikhit baat, ko yahaan uddhrut karnaa chaahunga
 i could not understand it until i was aware of these facts, which i have mentioned so far
 yah kathan is prakaar he: "you would not have heard of any business that has a monopoly, has a customer base of about 125 crores, which has 100 percent of its sales on advance payments, and still lacks money
" ‘’adhyaksh mahodaya, ab tak bhartiya rail kii yahi kahani rahi he
 Madam Speaker, the discharge of social responsibility by the Railways is not an issue
 parantu saamaajik jarurat ke naam par lok-lubhaavan pariyojnaon kaa chayan kiya gaya, jinase railway ko mushkil se koi rajasav praapt hua ho
 Investments on non-viable projects continued in the name of social responsibility
 samagrat: dekha jaae to kai varshon tak na to in pariyojnaon se railway ko koi pratifal praapt hua or na hi puri tarah se saamaajik daayitv hi puraa hua
 This flawed management and apathy has led to a huge cash crunch for many years as a result of the 'decade of golden dilemma' - the dilemma of choosing between commercial viability and social viability
 adhyaksh mahodaya, mujhe pataa he ki mere purvavarti sammanit mantri bhi is anischitata kii sthiti se parichit the parantu unke dwaara in pariyojnaon kii ghoshnaa karte samay sadan main bajane vaali taaliyaan sunne se praapt hone vaale ‘nashe’ kaa ve parityag na kar sake
 Madam Speaker, by announcing some new projects i too can draw applause from this august House but it would be unfair to this organization which is going through a difficult situation
 meri ichha he ki rail ko sthiti main sudhaar laakar main varsh bhar taaliyaan paata rahun
 This lamentable situation of Indian Railways needs to be corrected immediately
 kuch sudharatmak upayon, jinaki maine yojana banaai he, main ek upaay kiraayon main sanshodhan kaa rahaa
 It was a difficult but necessary decision
 adhyaksh mahodaya, jaisaaki kaha gaya he ki Yatadgre odd results amritopamam
 ‘’dawa khaane main to kadavi lagati helekin uskaa parinaam madhur hota he’’ With this fare revision, Indian Railways will get an additional revenue of about 8000 crores
 baharhaal, svarnim chaturbhuj network ko puraa karne ke liye hamen 9 lakh karod rupe se zyada kii or keval ek bullate gaadi chalaane ke liye lagbhag 60,000 karod rupe kii aavashyaktaa he
 Madam Speaker, would it be appropriate that the rates of fares and freight should be increased and the burden should be passed on to the public for arranging these funds
 chunki yah avastavik he, isliye in nidhiyon kii vyavastha karne ke liye mujhe vaikalpik upayon par sochna hoga

 Jnanpith Award winner Indira Goswami, who is mediating on talks between the central government and ULFA, said peace talks with ULFA should be started at the earliest
 unhone kaha ki commander in chifaparesh baruako shaamil kiye bagaiyr bhi ulpha ke saath shanti baatcheet jitani jaldi sambhav ho sake shuru kii jaani chaiye
 Speaking on the sidelines of the book launch ceremony, litterateur Goswami said, 'we need to start a peace dialogue
 barua ko shaamil kiya janaa he lekin agar vah nahin aa pate he to koi doosraa rasta nahin he
 We have to go ahead with the peace talks with the hope of their coming and despite them
 ’goswami ne kaha, ‘meraurobind rajkhovako suzav he ki vah kisi bhi tarah pratishtha or sammaan ke saath paresh ko waapas laaye
 In response to a question about the success of peace talks and the restoration of peace in Assam in the event of peace talks without Barua, he said, "even if he does not attend talks, people still want peace
" prayek vyakti shanti chahta he
 Nobody is greater than people
 ’ In Hindu scriptures, lamps are considered to be of special importance to please any deity or for any ritual
 puja ke dauraan alag-alag sadhana ke liye vibhinn deepak kaa prayog kiya jaataa he jaise mitti kaa deepak, aate kii deepak, tambe kaa deepak, chaandi kaa deepak, lohe kaa deepak, pital yaa sone kii dhaatu kaa deepak ityadi
 The lamp is lit before starting any ritual
 sanathan dharm main kisi bhi anushthan kii safalataa us dauraan vahaan jalaae jane vaale deepak par nirbhar karti he
 Let us know which lamp should be used to get rid of any problem
 lambii bimariyon se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye koun se deepak kaa prayog karen-- janm kundali main lagn or lagnesh kii sthiti thik naa hone kii vajah se aksar vyakti biimaar pad jate hai
 - Rahu, Ketu and Shani are considered to be instrumental in afflicting Ascendant and Ascendant
 - shravan maas main rahu ketu shani ko prasann karne ke liye bhagwaan shiv ke namah shivaay mantra kaa pradosh kaal main jaap karen
 To appease Shani, light a lamp of sesame oil near the Shivling and chant the Shan Mantra 108 times
 - rahu or ketu kii prasannataa ke liye bhagwaan shiv ke mandir main alsi ke tel kaa ek diya jalaaen
 Because of this, when people start behaving hostile and the enemy is very upset, then use the divine lamp - if the horoscope is located in Mars (low) Cancer or if you are afflicted in the sixth house, then often people do not fight without fighting
 The reason seems to be
 -mangal ketu kii yuti bhi vyakti ko aksar logo se jhagada karwaati he
 -mangal Rahu Ketu Shani etc
 Worship Lord Bhairav or Lord Bholenath to pacify the sinful planets
 -aate main gangaajal milakar uskaa diya bane
 Fill mustard oil with 4 wick of Kalave and light a lamp while praying
 -kaary siddh hone par bhagwaan bhairav ko imarti kaa bhoga lagaakar baaten or mantra kaa 27 baar jaap karen
 Which celestial lamp to use for success in job and business - It is absolutely necessary to have good position of Sun Jupiter Saturn Mercury in birth chart for job and business
 - yadi shani neech kaa ho or rahu se yuti karen tathaa dasham bhav me baithe yaa dasham bhav par drushti daale to naukari karne main pareshaani aati he
 To remove all the problems related to the job, burn a quadruple of mustard oil in the root of the Peepal tree on Saturday evening
 - vyapaar main safalataa ke liye bhagwaan lakshmi narayan ke mandir main gaay ke shuddh ghi kaa diya subah ke samay jalaakar laal gulab ke phool bhagwaan ko arpit karen
 - ॐ Chant Shree Shreeye Namah Mantra 108 times uttarakhandamen sthaneey nikaay chunaavon kii taiyaariyon ko lekar donon pramukh rajnatik partiyaan bhartiya janata party or congress sakriy ho uthi hai

 Former Chief Minister Harish Rawat expressed great displeasure over not calling himself to the public consciousness rally in Dehradun

 "however, he congratulated the Uttarakhand Congress for such a" massive "and" impressive "rally and requested PCC President Pritam Singh to give them prior information about such programs in future
 uttarakhand congress pradesh adhyaksh preetam singh ne safai di ki party ke varisht netaa ravat ko suchit na kiye jane kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota

 Students want freedom from these 7 things
 
 
 
 
 1
 Mayank says that he wanted to study at Sainik School
 unka admician bhi ho gaya tha
 But every day he quit school after getting fed up with his seniors
 unka kahana he ki unka skool ek army camp main tabdeel tha
 Where he had no freedom of anything
 unke anusaar aise skulon main bacchon kaa bachapan khatm kiya jaataa he
 They demand that the bullying of seniors in these schools should be eliminated
 2
 Rohit, who is currently in the journalism profession, says that even today, he hesitates to talk to girls
 unki jhijak ke peeche kaa kaaran he ki unke skool main ladakiyon se baat karne par ek tarah se pabandi lagi hui thi
 This ban was so strict that till date its effect is on them
 ve chaahate hai ki bharat ke skulon main teachers ko gender sensetive hona chahie or is tarah kii panbandi nahin lagaani chahie
 There should be a free kind of tragedy in schools
 3
 Vishnu, studying at Delhi University, says that there was a rule in school that you have to reach school before prayer and pray
 ve kehete hai ki unhen yah acha nahin lagata tha
 They demand that students praying and not taking care of freedom should be left to the students
 4
 Computer operator Sapna believes that many types of bogus books are taught in school, which have no meaning in practical life
 aisi bogus baton se unhen aazaadee chahie
 5
 college students rajesh kaa kahana he ki is desh main aasaani se ajukeshan lone milane kii baat kahana bevakoofi he
 The truth is that here you get a loan after wearing a lot of shoes
 ve chaahate hai ki students ko course ke kharche ke mutabik lone lene kii aazaadee honi chahie
 6
 SSC kii taiyaari kar rahi pushpalata kahati hai ki unke college main kahin likhit main to nahin bataaya gaya tha ki genes par pabandi he lekin college main genes pahananaa ek tarah se niyam todane jaisaa tha or kuch teachers iskaa jamkar virodh karte the
 She wants the students to be given freedom from these intrusive things by taking action against such orthodox teachers
 7
 Jitendra, who studies in BHU, says that there are many teachers in colleges who are not good at teaching at all
 ve saikadon students kaa bhavishya barbaad karte hai
 Referring to recent events, he says that FTII students are constantly agitating against the chairman, yet the chairman is not being changed
 students ke paas is baat kii aazaadee honi chahie ki unhen sirf or sirf achche shikshak hi padhaane ke liye aaen or shiksha ko raajnneetikaran se bhi aazaadee dilaani chahie

 The innocent killed in Anantnag
 unke matam ko kya naam duun? kya kahen kuch musalamaanon ne 7 hinduon ko maar diya or 19 ko zakhmi kar daalaa
 No, not at all
 
 
 hindu musalmaan kaa chashma utaar kar dekhen to pataa chalegaa ki haivaan to ismail tha jo sarhad ke us paar se aayaa tha or farista wo saleem tha jo hamaara apana tha
 Who saved more than 50 devotees by playing on his life and remember that the one who saves from the killer is always greater
 anantnag main amarnath yatra par gaye shraddhaluon par aatanki hamale ke dauraan logon ne aise hi ek bachaane vaale ko dekha
 Name is Salim Sheikh
 saleem us bas kaa driver he, jis par somvaar kii raat aatankwaadiyon ne hamalaa kiya tha
 But amidst a barrage of indiscriminate bullets, Salim, regardless of his life, tried to save the lives of the devotees sitting on the bus, anyone can be proud of him
 lekin andhadhundh goliyon kii bauchhaar ke peeche jis kukhyat aatanki kaa haath he uskaa naam he abu ismail
 It was Lashkar Commander Ismail who carried out the entire act of attacking Amarnath pilgrims
 amarnath ke begunaah shraddhaluon par andhadhundh goliyon kii bauchhaar karanevaale aatankwaadi bhi to kehane ko musalmaan the, lekin islam or musalmaan ke asal myne kya hote hai, ye pataa chalaa is aatankwaadi hamale kii jagah yani anantnag se do hazaar kilometre dur gujarat ke valsad se aae ek duusare musalmaan kii badaulat
 It was a coincidence that the terrorists who were firing guns on the bus of Hindu devotees carrying guns in their hands, was the only Muslim to drive the bus, Salim Sheikh
 aatankwaadiyon kii soch or gandi jehniyat ke ulat saleem ko islam or musalmaan hone ke sahi myne kaa pataa tha
 And then during this terrorist attack, he did the work which was the duty of any human being
 usne khud apni zindagi kii parvaah nahin kii or goliyon kii bauchhaar ke bich puri dilari or jambaaji ke saath apni bas chalaata rahaa or to or hamale ke dauraan ek baar phir bas kaa tair pankchar ho gaya
 But Salim Sheikh did not stop the bus and ran his bus for about one and a half kilometers till he got out of the reach of the terrorists
 iske baad usne apane ghar main telephone kar unhen apane salaamat hone kii khabar to di, saath hi ye bhi kaha ki wo haragiz televijan naa chalaae, jisase ghar ke duusare logon or khaas kar biimaar logon ko tension ho
 Needless to say that if Salim had not committed his zeal to the terrorists on Monday, the number of people who died in this attack today would have been much more
 lekin saamne se chalati goliyon ke bich wo apana sir jhukaa kar bas chalaata rahaa
 And how many more people were able to save their lives
 jammu kashmir se dur gujarat ke valsad main hamale kaa shikaar hue bas ke driver saleem ke ghar ek ajeeb sa maahaul he
 On the one hand, he is relieved and proud that his own Salim not only survived the attack, but also tried to save the lives of others by fleeing his bus
 lekin is hamale main jo log maare gaye, unke liye is parivaar ke dil main bhi ek ankahi tadap si he
 Perhaps then, her mother starts smiling to tell an account of Salim's bravery, but her throat is strangled and she starts crying
 udhar, saleem kii maa kii tarah aspataal ke bistar par padi ab bahut si maanon or bahanon ke dil se bhi ab bas saleem ke liye duaen hi nikal rahi hai
 Indeed, if Salim had not shown his bravery at the time of the attack, the result of this act of terrorists would have been terrible elsewhere

 But ever since childhood, anyone who visits the Sangh branch in his life is considered a member
 yaa yon kaha jaae ki shakha main jane kaa matlab hi sangh kaa sadsy yaa kaaryakarta hona he
 Now the new plant of politics, the Aam Aadmi Party has released a mobile number, on which the missed caller will himself become a member of AAP, even if your number was accidentally suppressed
 bijepi ke netaa bhi ab kehane lage hai ki jo kaam 'aap' ke log ab kar rahe hai, sangh parivaar pehle se hi karata aa rahaa he, lekin donon ke bich fark sirf itnaa he ki 'aap' vaale aadhunik takanic kaa istemaal kar rahe hai to sangh parivaar apni puraani paddati par kaam kar rahaa he
 Apart from the membership drive, the process is also similar to the way AAP collects donations

 Rakesh Singh said that 'digvijay Singh has lowered the might of Indian Army by praising Imran Khan today
 yah vahi congress he jiske netaaon ne sargical strike ke samay bhi saboot maange the
 But later when the evidence was given, it all sat like a coward, bowing his neck
 darasal desh ke logon ko paraabhav kaa itihaas padhaate-padhaate congress yah maan baithi he ki bharat mata kii kokh se shoorveer janm hi nahin lete'
 Rakesh Singh has demanded that 'digvijay Singh and other Congress leaders should apologize to the soldiers on their actions and desist from doing disgusting politics in the name of the country'

 Can Digvijay Singh explain why Sarabjit Singh could not be brought to India alive? Can Digvijay Singh explain what he has sympathized with Osama bin Laden? Does Digvijay Singh have an answer as to why he insulted the martyrdom in the Batla House account? Does Digvijay Singh have any reason to explain why he tried to inflict emotional distress on the wife of martyr Hemant Karkare? Digvijay came out of the traitorous mindset- Leader of Opposition, Gopal Bhargava, Leader of Opposition in Madhya Pradesh Assembly also Digvijay Singh Expressing objections to the statement, Digvijay Singh said that the country should desist from the malevolent mindset

 abhinandan ko lautaakar pakistan ham par koi ahsaan nahin kar rahaa he
 Pakistan had to do this under the rules of the Geneva Convention

 The Rajya Sabha could not run on the question of reservation in promotion on Thursday
 is baar pramotion main aarakshan kaa maamla saamne aa gaya
 The 117th Constitutional Amendment Bill was to be discussed in the Rajya Sabha which deals with this issue
 mayawati ne kaha, ye bill paas hona chahie
 But, Samajwadi Party mps created a ruckus and raised slogans of 'no reservation bill is needed'
 party kaa kahana he ki supreme court is maamle ko pehle do baar kaarij kar chukaa he isliye yah court ko chidhaane kaa kaam hoga
 It also alleged that the government is bringing this bill to avert the FDI debate
 tippaniyan Whereas BJP says that the government should take a proper look at the decisions of the Supreme Court before bringing this bill
 mushkil yah he ki is bill ke takaraav kaa asar epadiai kii bahes main sarkaar ke samarthan par bhi pad saktaa he
 In the promotion, the question of reservation is complicated and sensitive too, so the government wants to move ahead by making political consensus on this bill
 lekin, basapa or sapa ke bich takaraar se saaf he ki is bill par aage badhanaa sarkaar ke liye ek mushkil chunauti sabit hone vaala he
 This time the matter of reservation in promotion came up
 rajyasabha main 117wein samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak par charchaa honi thi jiskaa vaasta isi masale se he
 Mayawati said, this bill must pass
 lekin, samaajawaadee party ke saansadon ne is par hangaamaa kar diya or 'aarakshan bill nahin chahie', ke naare lagaae
 The party says that the Supreme Court has dismissed the case twice before, so it will be a task to tease the court
 yah aarope bhi lagaaya ki epadiai kii bahes taalane ke liye sarkaar yah bill laa rahi he
 The comments jabaki bijepi kaa kahana he ki yah bill laane se pehle sarkaar supreme court ke faisalon par thik se nazar daal le
 The difficulty is that the conflict of this bill can also have an impact on the government's support in the FDI debate
 tarakkee main aarakshan kaa sawaal pechida he or samvedansheel bhi isliye sarkaar is bill par raajnneetik sahmati banaakar hi aage badhanaa chaahati he
 But, the dispute between the BSP and SP is clear that going ahead on this bill is going to prove to be a difficult challenge for the government
 mayawati ne kaha, ye bill paas hona chahie
 But, Samajwadi Party mps created a ruckus and raised slogans of 'no reservation bill is needed'
 party kaa kahana he ki supreme court is maamle ko pehle do baar kaarij kar chukaa he isliye yah court ko chidhaane kaa kaam hoga

 yoga vishwa itihaas kaa sabase purana vigyaan he, jisane vyakti ke aadhyatmik or shaareerik kriyakalapon ke liye nae dwaar khole
 When was Yoga born? The description of yoga is found in the Vedas and Jain texts, but even then yoga was present even before it, even if it was not written in any texts because the knowledge of yoga must have been passed on from generation to generation due to the sage tradition
 yoga shabd kaa shabdic arth- judana yaa milanaa hota he lekin yah bahut vistrut vigyaan he kyonki iske sabhi karm or kriyaayein manushya ko shaareerik or atmik rup se purna yogi banaati he

 And this was also the first time that any such initiative was passed in the UN Assembly within 90 days by any country
 yah bhi apane aap main ek record he
 Why only on 21st June? The reason behind the making of International Yoga Day on 21st June is that the summer solstice happens on this day
 is din surya dharti kii drushti se uttar se dakshin kii ore chalanaa shuru karata he
 That is, the Sun which was till now in front of Northern Hemisphere, now starts moving towards Southern Hemisphere
 yoga ke nazariye se yah samay sankraman kaal hota he, yani roopantaran ke liye behatar samay hota he

 ye saat rishi unke pehle saat shishy the, jo yoga vigyaan ko duniya ke har kone main le gaye
 It is a matter of great pleasure that 21 June became the symbol of that great event in the history of humanity
 yogic kathaon ke anusaar yoga kaa pehla prasar shiv dwaara unke saat shishyon ke bich kiya gaya
 It is said that these Sapta Rishis were given initiation of yoga on the first full moon day after the summer solstice, which is also celebrated as the incarnation of Shiva

 He also informed that he was not named in the first list of Lok Sabha candidates released on Thursday
 unhone kaha ki party is bare main antim faisla karegi
 On repeated scams of journalists, Advani said that he had given them the news
 bijepi ke sabase bade netaa us seat se chunaav ladanaa chaahate hai, jiskaa pratinidhitiv vah 1991 se karte aa rahe hai, isamen khabar kya he? party ke maardarshak ke rup main unhen apni ichha ko saarvajanik rup se prakat karne kii aavashyaktaa kyon padi? unhone is saarvajanik rup se jaahir tathy ko kyon doharaaya ki brihaspativaar ko jari pehali suchi main unki naam nahin he? gandhinagar se ladane kii apni ichha ko saarvajanik karne ke baad unhone kyon kaha ki is bare main party antim nirnay karegi? The answers to these questions come from Advani's activities and activities since the 2009 debacle

 By making Nitin Gadkari the BJP president, the RSS hinted at strengthening its hold on the party, while Advani kept on hitting Gadkari on many issues
 unhen dobaaraa kaarykaal na milane ke peeche bhi adwani kaa sakht virodh mana gaya
 During the Anna Hazare movement, Advani kept saying within the party that BJP did not look serious on the issue of corruption
 isi dauraan unhone kaala dhan waapas lene ke mudde par aresas kii anichhaa ke baavjood rath yatra nikaali
 The motive was to convey the message that he remains the prime ministerial contender for the 2014 election

 party ne phir maan-manouvval kii, lekin vah aresas se ye aashwaasan nahin paa sake ki pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar chunate samay unki baat suni jaaegi
 Rather, the Sangh ignored his argument that the BJP should declare its prime ministerial candidate after the December 2013 assembly elections
 13 sitambar, 2013 ko jab modi ko piem ummidavaar ghoshit kiya gaya, adwani ghar par hi rahe
 He also attacked party president Rajnath Singh by issuing a statement that the party was not doing well
 aresas yah maanata rahaa he ki bijepi ko is mukaam tak pahunchane main adwani kaa yogadan behad ahm he, lekin saath hi yah akalan bhi he ki 2004 kii haar ke baad se bijepi agar patari par nahin aa pai he, to isaki vajah adwani kaa sheersh netaa ke bajaae ek gut ke netaa ke rup main kaam karnaa rahaa he
 It was said that Advani, who as a top leader should have resolved the quarrels of second generation leaders, has become the leader of a group
 aresas party kii kaman puri tarah se duusari peedi ke netaaon ko dena chahta he
 It was his endeavor that veteran leaders like LK Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi go to the Rajya Sabha instead of contesting the Lok Sabha elections to give the message that they will no longer play the role of guiding the party, but in active politics
 koshish yah bhi he ki adwani or joshi kii siten yani gandhinagar or banaras se narendra modi hi chunaav laden, taaki peedi parivartan kaa sandesh bheja ja sake
 Also, Modi's election to Benaras benefited from UP as well as parts of Bihar
 lekin adwani or joshi donon ne rajyasabha jane se inkaar kar aresas kii yojana ko phir naakaam kar diya
 Advani has put the ball again in the Sangh's court by giving a statement to contest from Gandhinagar itself
 adwani yah bhi chaahate the ki brihaspativaar ko jari pehali suchi main hi unka naam ghoshit kar diya jaae, lekin party ne aisa nahin kiya
 Amit Shah, close to Modi and general secretary in-charge of Uttar Pradesh, publicly stated that he wanted himself and the state unit of the party to contest elections from UP
 yani is vivaad par antim shabd abhi kaha janaa baaki he, par itnaa saaf dikhataa he ki bataur netaa bijepi ko farsh se arsh tak pahunchane vaale adwani bagawati tevar dikhaakar party kaa kam or swayan kii chhavi kaa nuksaan zyada kar rahe hai
 Superstar Salman Khan has said that there is no formula to make super hit and money making films and filmmakers should also focus on the subject matter
 salmaan kii kai filmon ne lagaataar sau karod se adhik kii kamai kii he

 abhinetri jacleen furnandis ke saath 'kik' main najar aa rahe 48-varshiya abhinayta ne bataaya ki jab tak film pradarshit nahin hoti he or yah darshakon tak nahin pahunchati he, tab yah is baat kii koi guarantee nahin he ki yah film super-dupar hit hogi yaa flop
 The script of the film 'kick' is written by Chetan Bhagat
 unhone kaha ki koi formula nahin he
 The best directors, better producers, actors who have given hit after hit have also failed miserably
 ve sochate hai ki unki filmein behtareen sabit hongi, lekin aisa nahin hota he
 'dabangg' star Salman believes that the success of a film depends on the response it received from the audience on the first day
 salmaan khan ne kaha ki film nirmaataa 300 karod yaa 400 karod kaa aankada chhune ko lekar anumaan vyakt nahin kar sakate

 upi ke baaise zilon main 118 madrase aise hai, jo zamin par nahin, balki sarkari filon main hi chal rahe hai
 In the name of madrasas, they get crores of rupees annually from the government
 enditivi ke kamaal khan kai zilon main in farzi madrason ke paton par gaye, to dekha ki un paton par kahin koi dukaan chal rahi he, to kahin koi beauty parlor, to kahin kisi kaa ghar he
 The government has now set up an investigation on this scam
 lakhanu main aise hi ek makaan main rahane vaali ranjana joshi hairat se kahati hai ki vah yahaan kai saalon se rah rahi hai or yahaan kabhi koi madrasa nahin tha
 Significantly, there are about 10 thousand madrasas in UP
 kuch sarkari madad se to kuch chande se chalate hai
 Madrasas are given this government support for their building, teachers' salaries, furniture, computers, etc
 sarkari jaanch main ab tak yah pataa chalaa he ki 118 aise madrase hai jo filon par hi chal rahe hai or unhen sarkari madad badastoor jari he
 Minority welfare minister in UP government Azam Khan said that when it was found out what happened with government help
 tab is baat kaa khulaasa hua ki kai madrase vaastavikta main hai nahin, or inaki taadaad bhi kam nahin he
 In search of one such fake madrasa, Kamal Khan of NDTV reached the office of an Urdu newspaper
 is akhbaar ke sampadak hissam siddiki ne bataaya ki unke daftar ke saamne jis masjid main namaad padhi jaati he, vahaan sarkari record ke anusaar madrasa chalata he
 Once, a check was accidentally handed over to the postman in his office

 During this, he came to know that in the form of a grant of 70-75 thousand rupees a year, he gets fake offers
 check aate hi vibhaag ke adhikari apana hissaa lene aa jate hai
 They know when the check is sent from the postal department
 jhaansi main ek madrase ke pate par beauty parlor mila
 The documents have about 100 madrasas in Meerut and 34 of them were found to be fake
 yahaan par ek madrase ke pate main parchun kii dukaan chal rahi he
 Azam Khan, a minister in the UP government, says that there should be no law of wrongdoing in the work of religion
 madrase kaa paisa sahi logon tak pahunchnaa chahie
 According to the information, this business of fake madrasas has been going on for decades
 aarope he ki is ghotaale main 65 fisadi rakam alpsankhyak kalyaan vibhaag or 35 fisadi rakam madrasa chalaane vaale ko milti he
 Now it is being investigated who ate the amount

 An alternative is to offer the BJP the post to Anna DMK, which has 13 mps

 " wo ek peshewar mujrim tha
 More than thirty cases were in his name
 tabhi saal bhar pehle dilli ke conot place main wo ek ladki ko dekhtaa he
 He falls in love with the girl
 iske baad puure saal bhar wo uskaa peechha karata he
 Neither ever talks to him nor meets nor taunts him
 yahaan tak ki uske kareeb rahane ke liye wo auto kharid kar auto vaala tak ban jaataa he
 Then suddenly after a year, one day he says, 'where so many cases, there is also a lawsuit of love
 ' gajiabad kii dipti kii kidnaping kii puri kahani bas yahi he
 The 'right to a lawsuit' love is actually the feeling that lives in every heart
 wo jajbaahai jo kaaynaat ke zarre-zarre main bikharaahai or bas mohabbat kii isi ek fitrat par nafrat ko bhi mohabbat mohabbat he
 The old saying that love is blind and the new truth is that in love, people also become blind
 aisa na hota to ye aashiq mohabbat ko mukadmaa nahin banaata
 There is hardly any love story of love wrapped in crime or say that one-sided love story
 kisi ko agava karne ke baad khud use vahi chhodane jaae or phir puche ki 'dost bana kar ja rahi ho yaa dushman?' aisi kidnaping dekhi he kabhi?'hero' banane ke liye bana 'villen'gajiabad kii 24 saal kii dipti kii kidnaping kii kahani kaa har panna khul gaya he
 Every mystery has been revealed and the answer to every question has been revealed
 snapdil main ejinir dipti ko agava karne vaala he to peshewar apradhi lekin usne use paison ke liye agava nahin kiya tha, balki uske dil main apni mohabbat jagaane ke liye kiya tha
 And he had done all the thinking that what would happen if he failed, a lawsuit in the midst of so many cases would be true of love
 dipti kidnaping kaa puraa sachis iktarafa lav story kii kahani 2015 ke janvari-farvari main shuru hoti he
 Devendra falls in love with Deepti at first sight
 iske baad dipti kii ek jhalak paane ko aae din uskaa peechha karata he
 Throughout the year, Devendra never tried to talk to Deepti
 na hi ek aashiq ban kar kabhi uske saamne aayaa
 But during this, Deepti, her house, office, family, friends found out about everyone
 ekatarfa pyaar bana jununvkt bitta jaataa he or iske saath hi devendra kaa ekatarfa pyaar junun main tabdeel hota jaataa he
 He wanted to get Deepti at any cost
 par ek villen ke taur par nahin balki hero ke taur par
 And in this attempt, he hatched a strange conspiracy
 sajeesh, dipti ko agava karne kii or sajeesh dipti kii najaron main hero banane kii
 Under the same plot, in December, three months ago, Devendra buys two autos and starts driving autos in the same area from where Deepti used to go from office to office and office to house
 doston ko bhi kiya shaamilpani is sajeesh main wo apane do doston ko bhi shaamil kar letaa he lekin unhen dipti or apane ekatarfa ishk kaa sach nahin bataata
 Rather tells a different story
 sajeesh chalati rahati he
 During this time there are also some occasions when Deepti sits in her auto and he goes to leave her home
 par aisa kam hota tha
 Because Deepti used to sit in the same auto in which one or two girls sit
 dipti kaa rakhaa puraa khyalsari reki or taiyaari ke baad devendra aakhirkaar dipti ko agava karne ke liye 10 farvari kaa din chunata he
 After Kidnapping, Devendra takes Deepti to her village through several places
 24 ghante biit jate hai
 During this time, Devendra repeatedly explains to dari-sahmi and weeps Deepti, encourages her, takes care of her, quilts her and even feeds her favorite food
 dost ko bataaya galatmagar iske saath hi wo baar-baar dipti se ye bhi kahata ki use kisi se milwane ke liye agava kiya gaya he or uskaa jo dost he wo acha insaan nahin he
 Stay away from it ye vahi dost tha jiske saath devendra ne dipti ko pehali baar conot place main dekha tha
 In the eyes of Deepti, the first phase of Herodevendra's plot was completed
 wo dipti kii najaron main acha ban gaya tha
 Now it was the turn of the plot of the plot
 devendra ko dipti kii najar main hero bananaa tha
 So he used to say to Deepti again and again that he is not bad
 par jin logon ne uskaa kidanap karaayaa he unase wo use bachaayegaa
 At the same time, he also kept telling Deepti that he should stay away from the friend with whom she was roaming in Connaught Place
 phir jab devendra ko yakeen ho gaya tab wo khud dipti ko lekar railway stesan jaataa he
 Are you going to make friends or enemies? This was the last line that Devendra had said while releasing Deepti
 darasal devendra kaa makasad kabhi bhi dipti ko nuksaan pahunchaana, maarna yaa phiroti lenaa tha hi nahin
 So as soon as he felt that he had become good in the eyes of Deepti, she released Deepti
 12 farvari ko devendra khud dipti ko lekar apane saath gaanv ke stesan tak gaya or use dilli jane vaali train main bitha diya
 As a headache for the police, Deepti took a call from a traveler and called her home, and then reached the security house
 ab chunki dipti khud se ghar aa gai, use koi chot bhi nahin pahanchi, na hi phiroti ke liye koi kol aayaa
 So the police was initially complicit
 use dipti ke kai bayanon par bhi shaq hua
 But then the truth came out in the investigation
 graduate he devendrasch saamne aane ke baad devendra ne baqayada police kii maujuudagi main apni kahani bhi khud sunai
 It is not known whether the fever of unilateral love has descended from Devendra's head or not, but now after his arrest, he is definitely saying that his paths are different and different from Deepti's
 suniye devendra kii kahani usee kii jubaani
 Devendra from Haryana is a educated criminal
 graduate devendrashahrukh khan, hitler or changez khan kaa fain he
 In fact, after reading several books to Devendra, it was realized that he has a beautiful girl in his life with whom he should settle down
 iske liye wo jurm kii duniya bi chhodane ko taiyaar tha
 And in this way the result of one-sided love is what was to happen
 haa, devendra apni ye baat jarur sach kar gaya ki jahaan itane mukademe hai vahaan ek mukadmaa muhabbat kaa sahi

 supreme court 9 november ke faisle par roak lagaae
 Reconsider the case
 misabahuddin, moulana hasabulla, haji mehboob or rigwan ahamed dwaara punarvichaar yachikaayen daayar kii gai hai
 If there is a hearing in open court, then all these petitions will have lawyer Rajiv Dhawan
 yachikaaon main kaha gaya he ki ye yachikaayen shanti or sadbhaav main khalal daalane ke liye nahin balki nyaay hasil karne ke liye daakhil kii gai hai
 Muslim property has always been the victim of violence and inappropriate behavior
 faisle main 1992 main masjid ke dhahaae jane kaa phayda diya gaya he
 An illegally placed statue cannot be legally valid and a verdict has been given in its favor
 supreme court kaa nau november kaa faisla babari masjid ke vinaash, gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se ghusane or kanoon ke shashan ke ulanghan kii gambhir avaidhtaon ko darshata he
 The undisputed fact is that the Hindu never remained in exclusive possession
 avaidhta main paae gaye sabooton ke aadhaar par hindooon ne daawa kiya he
 The Supreme Court's decision to grant five acres of land has also been questioned in the petitions
 kaha gaya he ki puja sthal ko nasht karne ke baad aisa koi "punarsthaapan" nahin ho saktaa
 It was not a commercial suit but a civil suit
 supreme court kaa ye nishkarsh trutipurna he ki yah dikhaane ke liye saboot hai ki hinduon ne masjid ke parisar main 1857 se pehle puja kii thi
 There is evidence to show that Muslims were in exclusive possession of the inner courtyard between 1857 and 1949
 court ke ye nishkarsh sahi nahin hai ki masjid paksh pratikul kabje ko sabit karne main sakasham nahin rahaa
 a reconsideration petition has been filed in the Supreme Court with the support of Jamiat Ulema A
 Hind
 isamen supreme court se 9 november ke faisle par punarvichaar karne kii maang kii gai he
 This petition has been filed on behalf of m Siddique
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki supreme court kaa nishkarsh sahi nahin he ki yah dikhaane ke liye saboot hai ki hinduon ne masjid ke parisar main 1857 se pehle puja kii thi
 These findings are also not correct as there is evidence to show that Muslims were in possession of the inner courtyard between 1857 and 1949
 supreme court ne apane nishkarsh main kaha tha ki masjid paksh pratikul kabje ko sabit karne main sakasham nahin rahaa or ye bhi sahi nahin he
 The petition stated that the Supreme Court had read in the ASI report that it was concluded that the mosque did not come on vacant land but on the ruins of an un-islamic structure that was largely of the 10th century But it resembled Hindu structure
 ye bhi sahi nahin he
 The Court accepted the evidence given by the Hindu side as accounts of travelers, historians and writers but ignored the same evidence furnished by us
 court ne ek nishkarsh par pahunchane ke liye kaha ki musalamaanon ne yah bataane ke liye koi saboot nahin diya he ki ve 1857 se pehle ke aantarik praangan ke anany kabje main the, jo ki sahi nahin he
 The petition said that the Supreme Court erred in the conclusion that Hindus unquestionably worshiped inside the mosque, which considers the inner sanctum as the birthplace of Lord Rama
 muslim paksh ko anuchhed 143 ke tahat muslim paksh ko paanch acre jameen dene kaa faisla bhi sahi nahin he
 Jamiat has focused on the three points of the court's decision that mention historical mistakes
 lekin faisla inke thik ulat aayaa
 The first is that the Supreme Court has said in its judgment that there is no strong evidence that the mosque was built after breaking the temple
 doosraa ye ki 22-23 disambar 1949 kii raat aantarik ahaate main murtiyon rakhana bhi galat tha
 Breaking the disputed structure on 6 December 1992 was also wrong
 lekin in galatiyon par sazaa dene ke bajaay unako puri zamin de di gai
 Therefore, the court may reconsider this decision
 akhil bharat hindu mahasabha ne bhi supreme court (supreme Court) main punarvichaar yachika daakhil kii he
 The petition sought to reconsider the decision to give 5 acres of land to the Sunni Waqf Board
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki supreme court ke anuchhed 142 ke tahat muslim paksh ko paanch acre jameen dene kaa faisla sahi nahin he kyonki ye ek civil suut tha
 When the court has given the decree to Ramlala, there is no justification for giving alternative land like this
 yachika main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki supreme court ne apane nau november ke faisle main dhaanche ko masjid bataaya he, wo bhi sahi nahin he kyonki court ne khud mana he ki iske neeche mandir tha
 When the bench of five judges did not consider the Waqf Board as entitled how can the structure be called a mosque
 yachika main supreme court kii un tippaniyon par bhi sawaal uthaae hai jisamen kaha gaya tha ki 6 disambar 1992 ko babari masjid dhahaaya janaa kanoon ke khilaaf tha
 In a petition filed by advocate Vishnu Jain, the Hindu Mahasabha said that the court should remove these comments as it would directly affect the ongoing criminal conspiracy trial in the special CBI court of Lucknow
 is maamle main shikshavid or activist bhi supreme court (supreme Court) pahunch gaye hai
 He has filed a review petition on the November 9 verdict in the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid case
 arthshaastri prabhaat patnayak va activist or purv iees adhikari harsh mandar pramukh yachikakarta hai
 Prominent names on this petition include historian Irfan Habib, writer Farah Naqvi, sociologist Nandini Sundar, activist Shabnam Hashmi, Aakar Patel, poet and scientist Gauhar Raza, writer Natwar Badhwar, economist Jayati Ghosh, historian Tanika Sarkar and retired diplomats and Aam Aadmi Party
 Former members include Madhu Bhaduri
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki faisle main ram janmabhumi-babari masjid maamle ko bharat main hinduon or musalamaanon ke bich vivaad ke rup main mana gaya he
 While the case was between self-proclaimed organizations that claim to represent the feelings and interests of Hindus and Muslims
 lekin aisa karne ke liye koi spasht janadesh nahin he, na hi anubhavjanya sakshya he ki ve in dharmon ke logon kaa vyapak samarthan karte hai
 The verdict names the litigants and organizations as "hindu" or "muslim"
 is maamle main apni yachika ko sahi tehraate hue activist kaa kahana he ki supreme court ne khud hi hinduon or musalamaanon ke vishwaas ke bare main ek bahes ke liye swaamitv or sampatti par kabje ke liye ek tital suut main maamle ke daayre kaa vistaar kiya he
 But Hindus and Muslims never heard from petitioners in this case
 aisa karne se isane prayek bhartiya ko tital suut ke mudde par adaalat se raahat paane kaa adhikaar diya he
 The petition has also questioned the November 9 decision and it has been said that this decision seems to be leaning towards one side
 nirmohi akhaada ne bhi supreme court (supreme Court) main punarvichaar yachika daakhil kii he
 The akhada has said in the petition that the Supreme Court in its November 9 decision directed the Center to give it adequate representation in the trusts set up to construct the Ram temple
 nirnay ke baad ek maheene se adhik samay biit chukaa he lekin ab tak isaki bhoomika or pratinidhitiv ko paribhaashit nahin kiya gaya he
 The arena seeks clarification in this regard
 yachika main vivaadit adhigruhit 2
 There has also been a demand to return many of the temples owned by it outside the 77 acres of land
 pis party ne bhi supreme court (supreme Court) main punarvichaar yachika daakhil kii he
 The petition said that the Supreme Court's decision is based solely on the ASI report and not on the facts
 san 1949 tak kabza hameshaa muslimon ke paas tha or bhartiya sakshya adhinium 110 kaa isamen paalan nahin kiya gaya
 Lied by Hindu parties
 kendriya gumbad ke neeche masjid main 1949 tak namaaj adaa kii gai thi, or 1949 se pehle vahaan koi murti nahin thi
 Before 1949, no Hindu prayed
 eesai dwaara koi saboot nahin diya gaya he ki vahaan mandir tha jo ram ko samarpit tha
 In 1885 there was the Ram Chabutara Ram Temple which is the outer courtyard of the Babri Masjid
 isamen muslim paksh kaa aantarik angan kaa adhikaar tha
 But in the recent judgment it has not been established by the Supreme Court
 ayodhya maamle main shiya vakf board ne bhi supreme court (supreme Court) main punarvichaar yachika daakhil kii he
 It has opposed giving five acres of land to the Sunni Waqf Board to build a mosque
 kaha gaya he ki agar jameen di bhi jaati he to vah ayodhya se baahar ho or masjid ke liye nahin balki aspataal aadi ke liye ho

 5 Stardirector: Rohit Dhawan Kalakalakar: John Abraham, Varun Dhawan, Akshaye Khanna and Jacqueline Fernandescoi Any film rests on important factors like story
 kahani main dam he to film ke box offis rupi baitarani ko paar karne main koi dikkat nahin aati or agar kahani main hi locha he to film main phir jitna bhi style or swag daalaa jaae uski kismat ko badla nahin ja saktaa
 But it has been seen that many bad films in the name of stars in Bollywood also do well and this is also creating wrong trends
 'dhishum' aisi hi film he jo in saare factors ke bich jhulati najar aati he
 The story of the film is predictable
 kairactor kaaphi kuch 1970-80 ke dashak jaise hai
 Rohit Dhawan tried to spice up every spice in the film that could help drag the film to the box office
 lekin film main baandhakar rakhane vaale factor missing hai
 How much power in the story: Saqib Salim is a cricketer and gets kidnapped
 do din baar bharat kaa pakistan ke saath cricket match he
 Then from the lift to the plane, John Abraham, a cigarette smoker, is tasked with finding the cricketer, which he has to do with great silence
 vah ek nikamme saathi varun dhawan ko apane is kaam main madad ke liye chunata he
 Jacqueline, a small burglar, helps them in this task
 villen ke taur padakshay khannaka aagaaj hota he, or unke kaam se zyada unka naam sunakar majaa aata he 'wagha
 'the film plays perfectly in the style of Rohit Shetty, sprinkle some comedy, infuse fantastic action and put the story on the backseat
 star apil:jon abraham ection acha kar lete hai or acting bhi unki badhiya hi he
 As a strict officer, he is perfectly set in his character, and he has played his role well
 varun dhawan ko film main hansaane kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya he or unhen kuch panch line di gai hai
 These punch lines are a bit tight and with every film it seems that Dwayne Johnson 'the Rock' and Govinda dominate them a lot
 unki acting main govinda kaa put to bahut najar aata he, or khaas taur par kamedi or dance ke samay
 Then her dance number with Parineeti Chopra brings us memories of Govinda's style songs
 jacleen furnandis kaa role bhi thik he, unhen jo saunpa gaya he, vah use nibhaane kii bharpoor koshish karti hai
 Akshay Khanna has returned to the character of Villain but he does not get scared and he does good acting but his character is very weak and old type
 akshay kumaungar film main mazaakia tip kaa chemiyo na bhi karte to film kii sehat par koi fark padane vaala nahin tha
 Talk of earnings: 'dishoom' is a big budget film, in which a lot of money has been spent on action and locations
 agar thodaa time kahani par bhi lagaaya gaya hota to acha lagata or steriotip chizon se bachate film or actor donon kii sehat ke liye badhiya hota
 In the film, a factor like cricket has also been inserted and a character like Viraj Sharma has also been coined by adding the names of the players of the Indian team
 iskaa bajet 60-70 karod rupee ke bich he
 In this way, the journey at the box office for the film will not be easy
 lekin yah he ki agar dimag par jor nahin daalaa jaae to dhishum ek baar dekhi ja sakati he
