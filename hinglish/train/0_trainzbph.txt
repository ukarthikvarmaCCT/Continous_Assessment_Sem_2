 I'm still wondering WHO said WHAT n to WHOM n who's asking me to find out WHAT happened WHERE vikram par bahut kuch daanv par laga tha lekin 7 sitambar ko desh kaa chandramaa lander chandramaa kii sataha par jaakar ukadu baith gaya to maano kisi rahasyamay tareeke se sab dhul gaya
 On it was the compact rover Prajnana, with the country's national emblem inscribed on its wheels, marking a permanent identification of India's presence on the moon
 agar lander, jiskaa naam desh ke antariksh kaarykram ke janak vikram sarabhai ke naam par rakhaa gaya tha, safal ho gaya hota to bhartiya antariksh anusandhan sanghathan (isro) kii 50veen varshganth samaaroh kaa behatar samaapan hota
 It would have also sent the message to the world that India is now in the era of space research and has become the fourth country to make easy landing on the moon after the US, the then Soviet Union and China
 sanyog se narendra modi sarkaar ke duusare kaarykaal ke sau din bhi puure ho rahe the
 More than anyone else, ISRO Chairman Kailasavadivu Sivan understood the level of risk involved in linking this special space program with national aspirations
 unhone india today se kaha, ''rocket science main, hameshaa bahut kuch anjaanaa hota he
 '' (see conversation)
 1958 ke baad se 109 chandra abhiyaanon main se, keval 61 yani aadhe se thode adhik hi safal rahe hai
 Like Chandrayaan-2, a soft landing of 46 missions was planned but only 21 of them, ie slightly less than half, were successful
 isro ne 2008 main chandramaa kaa chakkar lagane ke liye ek orbitor, chandrayan-1 ko bhejne ke apane pehle prayaas main kamyaabi hasil kii thi or chandra kii sataha par upkarnon ke durghatnagrast hone ke sambandh main mahatvapurn jaankariyaan bhi jutai thim
 Before he collapsed, he sent important information about the presence of water molecules on the moon
 iske baad isro ne 2014 main apane pehle hi prayaas main mangal kii parikrama ke liye mangalayan bhejkar duniya ko chaunkaa diya
 Mangalyaan will complete five years in orbit of this red planet on 24 September and will continue to send data back
 lekin in sabhi safaltaaon ke baavjood, chandramaa kii sataha se judi ahm jaankariyaan jutaney ke liye chandramaa par ek rover kii soft-landing karaane ke saath bahut-si nai chunautiyon se mukaable ke liye jatil praudyogiki kii jarurat hoti he jisamen isro ko maharath hasil kerani thi
 Therefore, given the excitement around the nationwide landing on the moon, Sivan, a veteran of space programs, predicted that Vikram's phase of landing from the lunar orbit to its surface could also be a '15 minute terror' for space scientists
 
 durbhaagya se sivan or isro ke liye, unki ashankaayen sahi sabit huin
 They ended up in 15 minutes of disappointment and grief, with the Prime Minister being present at the Mission Operations Complex in Bangalore to see it
 antariksh vaigyanikon kaa 12wein minute main vikram ke saath sampark tab tut gaya, jab yah chandramaa kii sataha se maatr 2
 Above 1 km was completing the important tactical task and there is no idea what happened after that
 haalanki isro ne 10 sitambar ko ghoshnaa kii ki chandrayan-2 orbitor ne chandramaa kii sataha par vikram ko khoj liya he or uski tasviir khinchi he, lekin isko lekar vah bahut utsahit nahin he
 Asked about Vikram being detected on the lunar surface, Sivan told India Today, "it doesn't mean much
" ham iske saath kisi bhi prakaar kaa sanchaar sthapit nahin kar paae hai or jab tak ham aisa nahin kar pate, iskaa koi arth nahin he
 "more important, Sivan said that scientists are still analyzing the details and there is no answer yet as to what went wrong with the lander
" to, jo vikram ne landing ke aakhri charnon ke antim teen minuton main aisa vicitra vyavhaar kyon kiya, jisane is mishan ko khatm kar diya? ek aadhikarik vifaltaa-vishleshan samiti kaarnon kii jaanch main juty he, india today ne kai antariksh vaigyanikon or visheshgyon se baat kii or yah samajhane kii koshish kii ki bharat ke is pratishthit lander main kya gadabadi hui ho sakati he
 Fluctuating Beginnings Here a little information about Vikram's history can help us understand why landing a lander on the moon is a complex task and why one of every two missions of this kind ends with failure
 bharat ne shuruyaat main apane dam par chand kii sataha par soft landing ke prayaas kii yojana nahin banaai thi
 Even before the launch of the indigenously built Chandrayaan-1 orbiter, ISRO decided that it could use the help and experience of Russia's Federal Space Agency (roskosmos) to make the Chandrayaan-2 mission a success, and in November 2007 An agreement was also signed for this
 bharat-rus ke is saajha chandra mishan samjhaute ke tahat isro kii mukhya jimmedaari orbitor banane kii thi jabaki lander or rover rus ko bananaa tha
 The launch was planned in 2012
 haalanki isro tay samay par orbitor ke saath taiyaar tha, roscosmos ne disambar 2011 main samjhaute se haath khinch liya
 Roscosmos did this in collaboration with the Chinese Space Agency due to the failure of the phobos-grunt mission to land his lander and rover on a moon of Mars
 isro ne tab faisla kiya ki vah khud lander or rover kaa nirmaan karegaa or use 2016 tak chandramaa par utaaregaa
 Meanwhile, the organization remade the orbiter for Mangalyaan, completing it in record time
 launture or upgrahon ke nirmaan main isro ke baari anubhav ke baavjood, isro ko jald hi samaj aa gaya ki lander or rover ko dizin karnaa or viksit karnaa bahut hi jatil kaary he
 U
 of ISRO aar
 Rao, a former director of the satellite center and in charge of planetary missions till last year
 annadurai ke anusaar, ''chandramaa par orbitor bhejnaa ek baat he, jaisaa ki hamane chandramaa par ek mahatvapurn anusandhan ke liye chandrayan-1 bheja yaa phir mangal par orbitor bheja
 But bringing the orbiting spacecraft down and slowly landing it safely on the lunar surface is far more complex and challenging
 '' isro ko lander ke utarane kii prakriya ko niyantrit karne vaale lacheele pranodan tantra banane or antariksh yaan ko chandramaa ke sataha par purv-nirdhaarit sthaan par utarane ke liye maargdarshan karne vaali niyantran pranali, in donon praudyogikiyon main maharath hasil karne kii jarurat he
 Both these technologies have been developed in the last five years and after the premature termination of the Vikram mission, the success of these two technologies is most suspect
 landing kii yojana4 sitambar ko orbitor chandrayan-2 se alag hone ke baad, vikram chandramaa kii sataha se 30 kimi kii oonchai par 1,680 meter prati second (yaa 6,048 kimi prati ghante, kisi commercial jet kii gati se chah guna) kii gati se parikrama kar rahaa tha
 Within 13 minutes the velocity had to be brought down, reducing it to the controlled phase, which would have been almost zero when it reached the surface
 lander aisa paanch rocket injanon or aath chote control thrusters kii madad se karata, jo uske tal main feet kiye gaye the or jise isro ne khaas taur se is mishan ke liye viksit kiya tha
 The engines were designed as throttle-capable engines, the pressure of which is controlled by stopping the flow of fuel flowing into it, just as the speed is controlled from the accelerator in the car
 chandramaa par landing kii jatiltaaon ko dekhte hue niyantran or maargdarshan pranali bhi viksit kii gai thi
 Distance between Earth and Moon3
 84 lakh kimi hone ke kaaran mishan ke prithvi par sthit niyantran kaksh se koi bhi nirdesh bhejne main ek second se thodaa adhik samay lagata he, or yaan ke cmand se uske bare main data waapas bhejne main bhi ek second or lag jaataa he
 During Vikram's fast landing on the lunar surface, decisions had to be made in milliseconds intervals, so ISRO developed an autonomous guidance and control system that took care of all possible conditions and anomalies during a 15-minute flight
 chandramaa kii sataha ke pariprekshya main yaan ko apane veg, oonchai, mudra, disha or sthiti kii nigaraanee ke liye atyadhik sateek maap upkarnon se susajjit kiya gaya tha, jisase vikram main laga onboard computer vaastavik samay main nirnay lene main sakasham ho
 It was also noted in the design of the vehicle's control and propulsion system that the Moon's gravity is one-sixth of Earth's
 chandramaa ke aniyamit gurutvkarshan ke anuroop paristhitiyaan taiyaar karke in donon pranaaliyon kaa pareekshan kiya gaya tha
 Big change Two years ago, the eyes of isro's new plan to land on the finished surface were also set
 lander ko dizin karte samay, isro ke vaigyanikon ne shuru main paanch ke bajaae keval chaar injanon ke saath kaam karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 In this configuration, the engine and guidance control system (control system) was to be brought about 10 meters above the lunar surface, gradually reducing speed and altitude
 lekin tab yah chintaa paidaa hui ki chandramaa kii sataha se itani kam duuri par hone se ingine thrusters, chandramaa par dhul kaa baari gubaar uda saktaa he jisamen yaan dhak jayega or uske mahatvapurn upkarnon ko nuksaan pahunchayegaa
 ISRO then planned to shut down all four engines and instead insisted on strengthening the four legs of the vehicle so that it would fall from that height itself and not cause any harm to the lander or rover
 janvari 2018 main is launch kaa samay nirdhaarit kiya gaya tha
 Meanwhile, fierce debate erupted among space scientists over the potential dangers of landing on the lunar surface while controlling a lander with four engines
 isro ne lander ke aadhaar ke centre main paanchvaan ingine lagaakar iske free fall ko rokane kaa faisla kiya
 This would have two benefits
 paanchvaan ingine keval tabhi shuru hota jab anya sabhi chaar ingine 10 meter kii duuri par band kar die jaaen or lander ke bahut simit gati se sataha ko choona sunishchit kiya gaya tha
 And this engine was located in the center of the vehicle, so the dust that caused this engine would push it away
 jaahir he, ek or ingine lagane ke nirnay ke saath antariksh yaan main or adhik vajan judata
 With other changes to its configuration, Chandrayaan-2's total weight is now 3, with the orbiter, lander and rover
 8 ton hota
 This meant that the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle, or GSLV Mark II, was no longer suitable as a launch vehicle, as it was capable of carrying only 2-3 tonnes of payload
 to chandrayan-2 pariyojna team ko isro ke sabase baari rocket jieselvi mark III, jiskaa kaary pragati par tha, uske launch ke liye puri tarah taiyaar hone or anumati hasil karne tak kaa intjaar karnaa padataa
 Instead of waiting for the entire series of test flights, ISRO decided to risk sending Chandrayaan-2 on the first operational flight of GSLV Mark xxrep 4 i 
 or shuruaati dar ke baad, jieselvi mark xxrep 4 i ne 22 july, 2019 ko apni chandra yatra par chandrayan-2 ko launch karne kaa kaam bahut khubsuurati se anjaam diya
 In order to land such a warped revolution on the Moon, ISRO designed a parabolic-driven trajectory, which was divided into four separate phases
 yah prakriya tab shuru hoti jab antariksh yaan chandra sataha se lagbhag 30 kimi kii oonchai par or landing sthal se 650 kimi dur pahunch jaae
 In the first phase, known as the rough braking phase and lasts for 10 minutes 20 seconds, Vikram will reduce the horizontal speed from 1,648 meters per second to about 150 meters per second using the tremendous power of his engines
 
 is charan main, chandramaa ke sataha se isaki duuri 30 kimi se ghatakar 7
 Will remain 4 km
 kaksha se alag hokar or swatantra rup se chandramaa ke chaaron ore ghoomte hue, vikram apane paanch injanon ke agboost fanal ke saath nikaal diya gaya, jahaan injanon kaa mukh isaki parikrama disha kii ore tha, na ki uske vipareet disha kii ore
 At the beginning of the landing phase, the computers involved started four of their five engines to reduce its speed drastically
 yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki yaan kaa horigntal (kshaitij) or vertical (lambavat) donon veg tay maapdandon ke bheetar tha, sabhi chaar injanon ko sahi or samakramik tareeke se shuru karnaa tha
 If one of the engines deviated even slightly from its scheduled time, the computer was designed to provide the required thrust using other engines
 doordarshan par ho rahe live telecast main vaigyanikon ko raf braking charan ke safaltaapurvak puraa hone par taaliyaan bajaate dikhaaya gaya tha
 But some experts believe that there are indications that troubles began to occur at this stage
 horigntal veg ko charan ke ant main lagbhag 150 meter prati second hona tha, lekin mishan sanchaalan parisar main bade consol par reeding se pataa chalaa ki yah lagbhag 200 meter prati second tha, yani jitna hona chahie tha, usase kahin tej
 On the other hand, the vertical velocity or the speed with which the lander was moving down ranged between 70 meters and 68 meters per second for several seconds
 yah sab us duusare charan main ho rahaa tha jise nirpeksh nevigation charan (eenpi) kaha jaataa he or yah lagbhag 40 second tak chalata rahaa
 In this phase, Vikram should have corrected any errors in the calculation of the main navigation parameters regarding its height and velocity, etc
 during the rough breaking phase
 vikram ne veg or oonchai ko maapne ke liye lage upkarnon or chandra kshetra kii tasviren khinchne vaale camaron sahit apane on-board maapak upkarnon kii reeding kii dabl checking (dobaaraa) jaanch kii
 Changes in the velocity, altitude or inclination of the spacecraft were to be corrected by autonomous control systems, which they themselves determine based on their logical decisions
 ek varisht vaigyanik bataate hai, ''computer main aapke dwaara gananaa or feed kii ja sakane vaali dakshataon or trutiyon kii sankhya keval aapaki kalpanaaon tak simit he
 The best control systems are those where scientists create systems that are able to keep their imaginations free and plan systems as much as possible for contingencies that are possible
 ''yah sankshipt eenpi charan main pahunchaa tha ki vikram ke niyantrit landing main pareshaaniyaan badaae lageen
 In the control room, the large console simulating Vikram's landing process showed that the lander deviated somewhat from its 45 degree tilt
 jiske kaaran isane ek ghota khaaya jisase jin injanon ko neeche kii ore hona tha, unka mukh upar kii ore ho gaya (graphic dekhen: hataasha ke 15 minute)
 One explanation for this is that the onboard computer was correcting the direction of the spacecraft to enable the cameras to take the position properly and take pictures according to the parameters for which it was designed
 lekin yah daanv baari pad gaya or iske kaaran neeche kii ore aane kii gati ghatane ke bajaae badaae lagi
 a second explanation is that the control system experienced a drop in velocity and corrected it, although the velocity was still within range
 aisa karne ke liye usne pehle veg ko badhaane ke liye yaan ko galati se 140 degree tak ghumaya, phir use mul sthiti main ulat diya
 But by then, the spacecraft had lost its direction and control
 kaabo ke baharayah vah lamhaa tha jab kul 90 second chalane vaala teesraa charan, fine braking speed phej shuru hua
 Two of its four engines were to be shut down to bring Vikram horizontally and vertically to both zero speed and to bring the lander to a height of 400 meters above the lunar surface
 is baat ke sakshya hai ki antarikshayan apana niyantran hasil karne ke liye bharsak koshish kar rahaa tha or kabhi idhar or kabhi udhar hichkole kha rahaa tha
 It was clearly visible on the console that the vehicle's vertical speed had increased and then all the contact with the control room was lost
 yah jaanane ke liye bhi koi sakshya nahin tha ki yaan ke do ingine yojananusaar band ho gaye the yaa nahin
 It was only revealed from the console that the horizontal speed was still much higher i
e
 48 meters per second and the vertical speed was 59 meters per second
 aakhri maukey par neeche utarane ke charan main lander ke pravesh karte vakt in donon hi maanakon ko kaaphi kam hona chahie tha
 On this occasion, his speed should have been close to zero and he had to hover in the void at an altitude of about 400 meters above the lunar surface
 isro ne yah tay kiya tha ki vikram ko chand ke apekshaakrit thande dakshini dhruv ke nikat sataha par utaara jayega kyonki vahaan pani ke kanon kii zyada taadaad main maujuudagi kii ummid thi
 This was the first time that a lander was going to try this and that was the reason
 chand ke madhya rekha ke aasapaas kii sataha ke mukaable dhruvon ke aasapaas kii sataha zyada gaddhon vaali he
 Vikram's control system, with the help of his cameras and other equipment, was to ensure that Vikram would land on a flat surface
 agar vah aisi kisi bhi sataha par utarataa, jahaan dhalaan 12 degree se zyada hota to vikram utarate hi palat jaataa, yani ludhak jaataa
 After deciding this, Vikram was to descend to a height of ten meters and then his control system mounted on the vehicle would shut down two more engines
 yah sab tab hona tha jab pehle ke charan main sari chijen sahi tareeke se chalati rahati
 But 2
 1 kilometre kii oonchai par hi jab usase sampark bhang ho gaya to is baat ko jaanane ke koi sakshya nahin hai ki nirnaayak landing vaala charan chaalu ho paaya tha yaa nahin
 According to experts, there may be three main reasons for this sudden elimination of Vikram, but they do not agree on which of these reasons is most predominantly responsible
 kuch log yah yakeen karte hai ki raf brake charan aakhri nevigation charan main jane ke dauraan uski pranodan pranali main kharabi aa gai
 At that time all his engine had to be fired simultaneously so that the speed of the lander could be reduced
 ye ingine nai technology par aadhaarit the, to yah andeh jaahir kiya ja rahaa he ki unamem se kisi ingine ne galat fire kiya hoga
 This would have made the conditions so unstable that they would have been out of bounds of the system and the control system would have been confused by it
 kuch anya logon kaa maananaa tha ki niyantran pranali main hi khami thi or usamen ek anupyukt tark nirmit tha, jiske kaaran aakhri nevigation or fine braking charnon se bich lander ne ek puri palati kha lee
 Meanwhile, ISRO scientists are studying every type of data sent by the lander before the signal breaks
 un saare aankadon kaa istemaal karke ve saare sambhavit paridrishy garh rahe hai taaki vikram kii landing ke haadase ko samajha ja sake
 After all, space is a ruthless place and it does not spare any mistake
 lekin samgr mishan ke taur par chandrayan-2 ne kai sari kamyaabiyaan hasil kii hai
 It has proven the authenticity of isro's biggest launch GSLV Mark III
 sabase mahatvapurn baat yah he ki upgrah yani ki orbitor khud shandaar tareeke se kaam kar rahaa he or usamen aath pramukh upkaran lage hai jo chand or uski sataha par pani kii maujuudagi ke sanket ke bare main tamaam tarah ke aankade sampreshit kar rahe hai

 The decision was taken in a high-level meeting chaired by Chief Minister Sheila Dixit in which the work of installing new streetlights to give a facelift to the city was reviewed
 is baithak main shaamil hone vaale ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya, ‘pariyojnaon par baat karte hue shila dikshit ne asantushti jataai or peedblyoody ko aadesh diya ki vah bajaj electricals limited ko die anubandh ko radd kare

 How upset people have become about inflation can be gauged from the situation after the rumor of rising salt prices in North Bihar
 uttar bihar ke shahar or gramin kshetron main afvaah ke kaaran namak kii keemat 100 rupee tak pahunch gai thi
 Not only this, people were also seen buying large quantities of salt at increased prices
 idhar, rajya ke khaadya evam upabhokta mantri shyaam rajak ne haalanki ise puri tarah afvaah bataate hue kaha ki kahin bhi namak kii killat nahin he
 Razak said on Thursday that there is no shortage of salt anywhere in Bihar, it is all a rumor
 unhone logon se afvaah par dhyaan nahin dene kii apil karte hue kaha ki kalabazar se nahin kharide
 He said that taking advantage of the rumors, shopkeepers are selling salt at a higher price
 unhone kaha ki sambandhit jilon ke jila adhikariyon ko afvaahon kii jaanch karne or doshi logon ke khilaaf karrwai karne kaa nirdesh de diya gaya he
 He has accused Bihar's opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of spreading rumors of an artificial salt crisis
 rajak ne kaha ki yah afvaah rajya sarkaar ko badnaam karne ke liye bhaajapa dwaara failaayaa ja rahaa he
 Here, due to rumors of increase in the price of salt in different areas of Samastipur on Wednesday, people rushed to the shop in a hurry and shopped the salt in bulk
 prayek vyakti adhik se adhik maatra main namak kharid kar rakhana chaah rahaa tha
 Shopkeepers increased the price of salt due to increasing demand for salt, which led to a price rise of Rs 50 to 60 per kg of salt sold from Rs 10 to 15 per kg
 idhar, samastipur ke jiladhikari naveen chandra jha ne bataaya ki namak kii badi hui keemat kii khabar maatr afvaah he
 He said that some people have stored it with the intention of black marketing of salt
 aise logon ko khilaaf kanoonee karwai karne or abhiyaan chalaane kaa nirdesh anumandal padaadhikari ko diya gaya he
 Here, in Benipur, Birol, Hayaghat, Kusheshwarsthan, Alinagar blocks of Darbhanga district, people came out of their houses due to rumors of increase in salt prices and bought salt at the rate of 60 to 70 rupees per kg
 kai sthanon par to namak kii keemat 100 rupee kilogram tak pahunch gai he
 Badri Yadav of Kusheshwar place said, "the price of all food items has increased, if the prices of salt have gone up, will you eat? That is why you have bought 20 kg of salt
 " sitamarhi jile ke bhi kai kshetron main namak ke daamon main vruddhi dekhi gai
 1 of Maharashtra Government Farmers 5 lakh rupee tak ke krishi karj kii maafee kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said in a press conference that Maharashtra has been in a drought situation since 2012 and since then many farmers have not been able to repay the loan
 unhone kaha, hamane sabhi partiyon ke pramukhon se charchaa karne ke baad karjamaafee karne kaa nirnay liya he
 With this decision, the exchequer of the state government will incur a burden of Rs 34,000 crore
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki yah desh ke itihaas kii sabase badi karjamaafee he or isse badi karj maafee dene kii sthiti main rajya sarkaar nahin he
 He said that 89 lakh farmers will benefit from this

 Let me tell you that earlier Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas member Ram Vilas Vedantine also said that he did not accept the arbitration of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar in resolving the Ram Janmabhoomi Babri Masjid dispute

 a Labor leader has claimed this
 chhapaakhana kaamgaar parisangh ke adhyaksh jagadish godse ne kaha, ‘‘noton kii chapai main aaayaatit syaahi kaa istemaal hota he jo abhi uplabdh nahin he
 Due to this, printing of 200 rupee and 500 rupee notes has been stopped
 ’’tippaniyan He said that this could also be a reason behind the problem of shortage of cash across the country
 haalanki unhone yah spasht nahin kiya ki noton kii chapai kab se band he
 This comment has come at a time when the government has ordered to increase the printing of 500 rupee notes by five times on the same day so that new notes of 75 thousand crore rupees can be supplied next month
 unhone kaha ki desh bhar main nakadi kii kami kii samasya ke peeche yah bhi ek kaaran ho saktaa he
 He, however, did not clarify when the printing of the notes had stopped
 yah tippanee aise samay aayi he jab sarkaar ne ek hi din pehle 500 rupee ke noton kii chapai paanch guna badhaane kaa aadesh diya he taaki agle maheene 75 hajaar karod rupee ke naye noton kii aapurti kii ja sake

 notebandi ke baad bazaar main bura haal he, kai market to band hi he, lekin sabase zyada pareshaani rozmarra kii zaruuraton ko puraa karne kii he
 The big and big markets are closed, but people are also facing another problem in the retail market
 ye samasya he chuttay paise kii
 On 8 November, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that 500 and 1000 notes will no longer run, there was a stir
 kaale dhan par roak lagane kii koshish kii tarif to hui, lekin pareshaani tab saamne ai jab log nae noton ke liye bhatakate rahe
 Not only this, people were seen trying to change their old notes
 haalanki puraane noton ko badalane ke liye sarkaar ne ek puraa plan bataaya
 Apart from depositing in the account, the system of ATM and exchange was implemented, but all these proved to be insufficient
 sabase badi samasya aam logon ke liye change kii he, kyonki logon ke paas puraane note hai, unke badale abhi tak bainkon se do hazaar kaa note mil rahaa tha, isse logon ke puraane or chalan se baahar ho chuke note to badal gaye, lekin market main do hazaar ke note ke badale khulle yaa chuttay paise nahin mil rahe
 About 86 per cent of the country's economy was of big notes i
e
 five hundred and thousand notes, meaning small notes like 100 and 50 rupees were already in the market in small quantity, when a large part of the currency was out of circulation
 Gaya, then the shortage of small notes was also natural
 alengepi hospital ke saamne chemist chalaane vaale naveen mitra isi samasya se pareshaan hai, akhabaaron or bayanon main bataaya gaya he ki chemist shop par paanch sau or hazaar ke note liye ja sakate hai, lekin ab dikkat ye aa rahi he, ki log puraane noton ko thikaane lagane ke liye chemist shop par pahunch rahe hai
 Even if the medicine has to be taken for ten rupees, the customers are willing to pay in 500 or 1000 notes, in such a situation, the shopkeepers are short of holiday money
 naveen mitra ke mutabik aisi sthiti main unke paas graahak ko waapas bhejne ke alaava koi chaara nahin bachataa
 Apart from the regular customers who have to change the balance slip system, in which the remaining money is being adjusted in the coming days
 yahi nahin aspataal main bhartee apane mariz ke liye dawaai lene aae deepak ke paas do hazaar kaa note tha, bill 180 rupee kaa bana, lekin mushkil ye thi ki dukandaar ke paas change nahin the or deepak ke paas pament karne ke liye chote note
 In such a situation, the problem is now where the changes come from
 ab bainkon ke paas bhi 2000 ke alaava 500 kaa nayaa note bhi aa gaya he, saath hi atim se bhi 500 kaa note die jane kii vyavastha karne kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 It should be hoped that in the coming days, the government will also bring more and more small notes in the market, so that the problem of holidays can be eliminated

 Just as the Vatavriksha remains intact for a long time, similarly the Vat tree is worshiped for the attainment of longevity, good luck and continuous victory
 isi vatvriksh ke neeche savitri ne apane mrit pati ko punah jivit kiya tha
 Since then this fast is performed under the name of Vat Savitri

 trayodashi ke din vriksh ke neeche is prakaar sankalp karnaa chahie jise purna kiya ja sake
 If you are not able to fast for 3 days, then you should follow Pratipada by fasting night food, Chaturdashi, Ayatya and Amavasya

 Also, Yama should also be worshiped

 Kejriwal is opposing the proposed bill to amend the Electricity Act on behalf of the Modi government
 ab isi sanshodhan kanoon ko hathiyaar banaakar ve bijepi or modi sarkaar ke khilaaf hallaa bol karne ja rahe hai

 At the same time, the Aam Aadmi Party will make electricity a big issue to surround more mps with BJP in Delhi and will go door-to-door about this law

 It has been priced at Rs 8,999
 graahak ise 21 oktober se dopaher 12 baje se kharid paaenge
 However, we have used this smartphone for a short time and now we are going to tell its quick review
 sabase pehle aapako bataa den is smartphone main panch hole disple, quad camera seoup or 32MP selfi camera diya gaya he
 In the market, this smartphone is competing with phones like Redmi Note 7S and Realme 5
 in donon bajet king ke in phones kii cell main shuruaati keemat bhi 8,999 rupee hi he
 By comparison Realme 5 is a new smartphone and its specifications are better than Redmi Note 7S
 aise main nae Infinix S5 kii tulana rialami 5 se hi karnaa zyada behatar he
 6 in the new Infinix S5
 6-inch disple, android 9 besd XOS 5
 5 Cheetah operating system, Octa-core mediatek Helio P22 processor, 4GB RAM, quad rear camera setup (16MP + 2MP + 5MP + 2MP), 32MP selfie camera, 64GB storage and 4,000mah battery
 to vahiin Realme 5 ke spacifications kii baat karen to yahaan gorilla glass 3+ protection ke saath 6
 5-inch HD + (720x1600 pixels) display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor, Android 9 Pie based color OS 6
 0, rier main quad rier camera seoup (12MP+8MP+2MP+2MP), front main selfi ke liye 13MP camera or 5,000mah kii badi bydaree milti he
 That is, Infinix S5 is only slightly ahead in terms of punch hole display look and 32MP camera
 baharhaal nae Infinix S5 ke first impressant kii baat karen to ye phone vajan ke maamle main thik-thaak hi he
 That is, its weight is not much
 iskaa back panel plastic kaa he or yahaan rier main hi quad camera seoup or fingerprint scinar diya gaya he
 But the phone feels quite large in the hand
 yani van hand handlling ke liye isamen thodi mushkil hoti he
 Talking about the look of the back panel, here is a dual tone gradient look panel
 lekin kaaphi audanry lagata he
 That is, it could be made a little more attractive
 hamane shaomi or rialami ke phones main bajet main bhi behatar panel dekha he
 Rest is given here on the right side of the power button and volume rockers
 jabaki bottm panel main 3
 a 5mm headphone jack, speaker grill and charging port are provided
 sim slot ko left panel main rakhaa gaya he
 The good thing is that there is also a separate slot for the memory card here
 front panel kii baat karen to yahaan 6
 a 6-inch punch hole display is provided
 yahaan LCD panel kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 Colors and brightness are also good here
 90
 Due to its 5 screen to body ratio, this phone is better for watching movies and playing games
 overol bild quality acchhee he
 There is not even rough age
 lekin rier panel kaa luk audanry sa he
 Talking about the software part, custom XOS 5 here
 5 Cheetah oparating system diya gaya he or iske control panel kaa luk behatar or jaruri togles bhi die gaye hai
 But there is a lot of bloatware
 kaaphi saare preloded eps bhi die gaye hai
 However, they can also be removed
 saath hi yahaan App Drawer bhi shaamil kiya gaya he
 Talking about the hardware, here is the Octa-core mediatek Helio P22 processor with 4GB of RAM
 is price segment ke liye ye procesar outdated he yaa yun kahen parfect match nahin he
 This processor is available in Realme's Rs 5,999 phone C2
 jabaki 8,999 rupee ke Realme 5 main snapadragon 665 procesar miltaa he
 However, regular tasks like app switching and multi tasking are not much lag
 lekin nae procesar dene se phone thodaa or smood ho saktaa tha
 Also, you can easily see the animation lag
 bydaree kii baat karen to yahaan 4,000mah kii bydaree di gai he, ye bhi Realme 5 ke 5,000mah kii tulana main kam he
 The rest, we have not checked the battery capacity or charging time
 photography ke section kii baat karen to isamen primary camere ke alaava ultra wide angel camera, super macro camera or depth camera diya gaya he
 Overall speaking, we personally liked only the primary camera in Day Light and Artificial Light
 baaki camaron kii parformens utani acchhee nahin he
 We have not tried it in low-light
 selfi kii baat karen to yahaan selfi bilkul real nahin lagata he
 That is, the skin tone seems quite artificial
 aise main Realme 5 jaise smartfones kii tulana main itnaa behatar nahin he

 Now is the time for online shopping, in which the customer is always shown the king
 lekin darasal aisa kai baar nahin hota
 Even there, he gets cheated or buys goods expensively
 itnaa hi nahin, discount ke laalach main vah kuch aise saamaan bhi kharid letaa he, jisaki use jarurat nahin hoti
 To avoid all this, we tell you some measures, by which you will be able to save your hard-earned money
 sabase pehle to dekhnaa hoga ki jo sauda aap karne ja rahe hai, usamen kitna phayda he
 In fact, despite the discounts, in many cases other online retailers are giving better discounts
 iskaa ek udhaaharan he flipcart kaa cell, jisamen mcbuk air 54,000 rupee main bataaya gaya, jabaki snapdil par vah us samay 50,000 rupee main mil rahaa tha
 This happened with many more items
 darasal online retailor discount ko badha-chadhaakar bataate hai
 In such a situation, it is important to be cautious and it is appropriate and beneficial to keep visiting other sites in between
 discount cell main sabase bada khatra yah rahata he ki isamen rifund yaa exange kii koi gunjaaish nahin rahati he
 If you do not like a product, you cannot change it, so avoid buying anything in which such situations may occur
 ye baaten online retailor kii site par sharton vaale kollam main likhi hoti hai
 Think before you pay with a credit or debit card
 behatar hoga ki aap nakad bhugtan kii suvidha len, jo delivery ke samay hoti he
 The advantage will be that if you change your decision later, you will not have trouble
 aapke paise bache jaaenge
 Instead of buying all the goods from a single website, keep an eye on many websites
 ve bhi pramotion karte rahete hai or badi chhot dete hai
 Many types of goods continue to get excellent discounts
 apana naam register karaaen
 By doing this, you can take advantage of the discount you get from that website
 matlab yah he ki agar aapkaa naam online retailor ke paas register rahegaa, to aapako order place karne main aasaani hogi
 But the biggest thing is that you have to decide whether you need the goods that you are going to buy
 bahut discount ke laalach main koi bhi aisa saamaan na khariden, jinaki aapako jarurat nahin he

 ' Rajasthan Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) vice-president Gyan Dev Ahuja on Thursday questioned the Congress president's claim of being Janeu Dhari
 unhone kaha ki congress ko us pujari kaa naam bataanaa chahie jinhone iske liye kaarykram kaa aayojan kiya
 Gyan Dev Ahuja on Thursday compared Congress President Rahul Gandhi to Mughal emperor Aurangzeb and said that the Congress empire is coming to an end
 ve mediakarmiyon se baat kar rahe the
 He said that Congress President like Aurangzeb is the last king of the Congress Sultanate
 jaise aurangzeb mughal sultanate ke aakhri badshaah the
 At the same time, Ahuja said that the end of the Congress is certain
 haalanki, aapako bataa den ki hakeekat bijepi netaa ke bayaan se ulat he
 Indeed, Aurangzeb died in 1707 and was not the last of his dynasty
 antim mughal shaasha bahadur shah jafar the, jinaki mrityu 1862 main hui thi
 But Aurangzeb is often seen as the last of the major Mughal emperors since the empire began to disintegrate after him

 Let me tell you that Congress won 99 of the remaining 199 assembly seats in Rajasthan

 It has been five days since the government came into action, but it is becoming clear that Jammu and Kashmir is on the top agenda of the new government

 At the same time, Kashmiri Pandits are planning to resettle in the valley
 sutara bataate hai ki paak adhikrut kashmir kaa naam paak adhikrut jammu-kashmir kiya ja saktaa he
 The reasoning behind this move is that not only the part of Jammu is also in Pakistan's possession

 In fact, the Modi government believes that saying pok does not reveal the whole truth

 Therefore you will find in each of my books that i have told some experiences of my life
 hajaaron log mujhe likh chuke hai ki kaise wings of fire, ignited minds or indomitable spirit ne unke dil ko chuaa or unke jivan main unhen padhane ke baad badlaav aayaa
 This is the biggest satisfaction for me
 aisa koun-sa tajurba he jo aapke mutabik sabase negative he or jise aapane likhaa ho?mere liye negative tajurbe jaisi koi cheez nahin, lekin mujhe bhi dikkatein ai hai
 Misses two occasions
 pehali baar profeshnal str par main tab naakaam hua tha jab 1979 main ek satellite karier kaa prakshepan vifal ho gaya tha
 i never let failure dominate me
 maine kuch behtareen logon se bhi sikh lee
 Instead of blaming me, my boss took the responsibility of not succeeding the project in front of 120 media persons
 agle saal jab main kaamyaab hua, to unhone uskaa shrey lene kii bajaae mujhe press conference ko sambodhit karne ko kaha
 This quality of leadership i had learned long ago in life that failure has to be carried on by the responsibility of my team and sharing success
 kai saal baad jab main raashtrapati bana or mere saamne offis of profit vidheyak aayaa, to mujhe laga ki kuch dikkatein hai, maine sansad se punarvichaar karne ko kaha
 There was a lot of controversy regarding my stand
 
 
 uske adhyayan ke liye ek sthaayee samiti kaa gathan karnaa padaa lekin main apane faisle par ada rahaa
 You looked at life by living at the level of a common man, later from a professional perspective and in the last ten years, you kept watching things while staying at the top of power
 kya aapako lagata he ki aaj koi aisa netaa he jo dosha ko apane upar lene or safalataa ko baantne kii kshamta rakhata he?(hansate hue) nahin
 
 
 View this photo main ise ''rajnatik pratishtha'' maanata hum
 It was taken in 2002 when my name was proposed by both Vajpayeeji and Soniaji
 
 
 isamen saare netaa ek saath dikh rahe hai
 What happened to your name this time? No one proposed this time
 beshak rajnatik dalon main mujhe lekar charchaa hui lekin mujhe nominete nahin kiya gaya
 Some people asked me to contest elections
 unhen maine bataaya ki main sahi samay par apana faisla bataaungaa, or maine aisa hi kiya
 But did Mamata Banerjee and Mulayam Singh Yadav take your name forward? (laughs) Yes, it was extended and withdrawn too! What do you consider to withdraw Mulayam Singh's name? i don't know, but i gave Mamta a His leadership qualities were definitely appreciated by writing a letter
 netritv sambandhi gun?haa, ve to singhaasana ke kareeb pahunch hi gai thim
 If they had tried with the system, they would have got everything they wanted or at least half of it
 lekin unhone ek adig rukh apanaaya or mauka ganvaa diya
 Of course they can regain their status
 unamem ek netaa kaa saahas or drushti donon hi he
 Do you really think Mamata Banerjee has a vision? First let me explain what the leader means
 netaa ke paas vijan or josh hona chahie, use kisi samasya se darana nahin chahie, balki use samasya ko shikast dena aana chahie
 The most important thing is that he should work with complete honesty
 or ek netaa ko 24 ghante main apane iraade bhi nahin badalane chahie!(hansate hue) main to sirf ek netaa ko paribhaashit kar saktaa hum
 i can not give you an example
 puraa desh is rajnatik drame (raashtrapati chunaav) ko dekh rahaa he
 On the day of Mamta and Mulayam's press conference, i was in Bihar for one day as the editor of Prabhat Khabar
 maine akhbaar ko das din pehle hi bataa diya tha ki yadi ve chaahate hai ki main unke akhbaar kaa sampadan karun, to pehle panne par ek aisa vichaar hona chahie jo logon ke chehre par muskaan laa sake, us par kisaanon, machuaaron, netaaon yaa kisi kii bhi kamyaabi kii daastaan honi chahie
 They showed me 20 success stories, i chose four of them
 iske alaava, maine unhen ek kavita di jo bihar ke naujavaanon ke liye likhi thi
 If you were to write a poem on this presidential election, what would be its first line? Courage, courage, courage! But nobody showed courage! Is this an appeal? (laughs) i proposed in Parliament that the parties should devote more time to the politics of development
 yadi koi party das saal ke bheetar garibi khatm karne kaa vaada karti he, to duusari party ko use chunauti dete hue aarthik samruddhi laane kaa vaada karnaa chahie
 It is being said that the day before you made the statement that you will not contest the presidential election, you prepared a statement in which the reasons for your candidature were counted, and said that you are not of any party, "the public
 Will the candidates be ''? Is this correct? i have never prepared such a statement
 kya aapane khud ko pratyaashee mana tha? yaa kisi se nijee taur par iskaa zikr kiya tha?nahin, bilkul nahin
 Many leaders called me to contest elections and asked if i would stand in the election if my name is suggested
 kya adwaniji ne bhi aapako kol kiya tha?haa, kai logon ne kol kiya
 Did Mamta Banerjee call you? And Mulayam Singh? Yes, everyone called me and asked to contest the election
 kai ashankit the ki main chunaav laduunga yaa nahin
 So in the end, you decided not to contest the presidential election because you did not have the winning numbers? (teble par rakhi ek tasviir kii ore ishaara karte hue) yah tasviir ek shisht sansadeey tantra kaa pratibimb he
 i dream of it and will work for it only
 lekin yah tasviir to dhokhaa he kyonki congress ne is baar jaan-boojh kar aapkaa naam sweekaar nahin kiya?main chahta hum ki aap 2002 kii is tasviir se yah samajhen ki sansadeey tantra ko kaise kaam karnaa chahie-netaaon ko raashtra hit main mil kar kaam karnaa chahie
 So could he work together at that time because Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister? Yes, leadership does matter
 ek netaa doordarshee or mishanri hota he
 He does not fear any problem, does not copy anyone, chooses his own path
 aapane ek bayaan diya tha ki shrimati gandhi ke (2004 main pradhanmantri pad par) daawa na karne se aap chaunke the
 If you look back, tell me what exactly happened in your first meeting with Mrs
 Gandhi and Manmohan Singh? After her (congress) election victory, no one came to meet the party for at least three days
 chunki vah sabase badi party thi, maine shrimati gandhi ko milane ko bula bheja
 She came with Manmohan Singh and told that the party has decided to make Manmohan the Prime Minister
 yaad kiijie, us vakt supreme court kii hari jhandi milane ke baavjood kai partiyaan shrimati gandhi ke pradhanmantri banane ke khilaaf thim
 i also received many letters against his becoming the Prime Minister, which i sent to the government (congress)
 to sarkaar kii pratikriya kya rahi?kuch nahin, sarkaar ne koi jawaab nahin diya (hansate hue)
 Subrahmanyam Swamy said that it was due to his interference that he raised the issue of citizenship
 iske alaava shrimati gandhi ke pradhanmantri banane ke khilaaf esemes abhiyaan bhi chale the
 Apart from Swami, many other parties and individuals had also written to me
 hamen yaad rakhana chahie ki in tamaam prachaar abhiyaanon ke baavjood ek nyaayik faisla aa chukaa tha
 When the Supreme Court said that Mrs Gandhi could become the Prime Minister, then who would i be? Then what was the reason that prevented her from contesting the post of Prime Minister? It is known only by Mrs Gandhi
 kya chunaav main haar ke baad aap vaajapeyi ji se mili the?kai baar
 He claimed responsibility for the defeat
 netritv kaa yah bhi ek gun he
 i remember when Narasimha Rao used to be the Prime Minister, i was the scientific advisor to his nuclear power program
 1996 ke chunaavon se thik pehle shri raav ne mujhase kaha tha, ''main tirupati ja rahaa hum, parmaanu pareekshan kaa intjaar karo
 "then the success was confirmed and they wanted to celebrate it with nuclear tests
" badakismati se ve haar gaye
 Then both the victor and the defeated called me, they wanted to meet me
 raav ne mujhe nae pradhanmantri ko parmaanu kaarykram kii jaankaree dene ke liye kaha
 When it comes to the country, work should go on because there is a larger nation than any political party
 ek mashhoor kissa he ki javaani main aapako swami shivanand kaa aashirwad mila tha
 As a child, i wanted to be a pilot
 bade hone par maine vaayu sena main aplai kiya or mujhe dehradun main intervyuu ke liye bulaayaa gaya
 My tough exam was taken for ten days and in the end i failed the medical test
 dukhi man se main lautaa to ganga ke tat par mujhe swami shivanand mili, jinhen hajaaron shraddhalu ghere hue the
 i sat in the last row
 kuch der baad unki najar mujh par or ek francisi paryatak par padi
 He gave us blessings and Vishwaroopam, which Krishna gave to Arjuna so that all his fears could run away
 dilli lautne par naukari meraa intjaar kar rahi thiah raksha mantralay main varisht vaigyanik salaahkaar
 In the book you have mentioned that you read the morning Namaz (fajr)
 haa, roj, jab bhi sambhav ho
 My father was very punctual about namaz and would wake me up at 4 am and take me to the mosque
 main roje bhi rakhata hum
 Then why do the so-called Muslim leaders of North India feel that you do not pay all the duty of being a Muslim? First of all i am an Indian and try to be a good human being
 log mujhe kuch bhi kah sakate hai, yah unki abhivyakti kii aazaadee kaa maamla he
 There is no doubt about my faith in Islam
 main akasar mandir or carch main bhi jaataa hum
 God is everywhere
 vaajapeyi jab pradhanmantri the, to aapaki unase akasar baatcheet hui hogi
 What is your assessment that Modi is guilty of Gujarat riots? It is not my business to give verdict on Gujarat riots
 yah kaam nyaaypalika kaa he
 But i would like to mention another incident about Vajpayee
 jab unhone cabinet kii kaman sanbhali, main vaigyanik salaahkaar tha
 One night he called me to his office and offered me a position in the cabinet
 main agni or parmaanu kaarykram main vyast tha
 The next morning i went to meet him
 ve apane kamare main baithe the or chaaron ore mithaiyaan saji thim, mithai unki kamajori thi
 i said sorry to him that i cannot become a minister because i am busy with two programs and that will be affected
 baad main jab meraa kaam khatm ho gaya, to maine sarkaar kaa kaam chhod kar adhyaapan shuru kar diya
 After this Vajpayee called me and asked me to become the President
 kya aapako lagata he ki vaajapeyi modi ko dangon kaa doshi maanate the?main unki ore se nahin bol saktaa
 Whether the riots were planned or happened suddenly, we do not know
 par koi bhi sahi soch vaala shaks kisi samudaay ke saath hue galat kaam kaa samarthan nahin karegaa
 When i went to Gujarat, i did not know what happened or whether Modi was wrong or right, rather my aim was to expedite the relief work and reduce the suffering of the people
 aajkal is baat ko lekar vivaad he ki modi pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ho sakate hai yaa nahin
 What do you believe? What i think doesn't matter
 hamaara desh loktantric he, bharat kii janata tay karegi
 Who among Nitish Kumar and Modi would be the better Prime Minister? (laughs) Why are you dragging me into controversy
 main donon ko bade achche se jaanata hum or donon hi achche dost hai
 Recently you met Nitish
 
 
 haa, raashtrapati chunaavon par baat hui thi
 He told me that i have a lot of support in the NDA but there are no winning numbers
 yani aapane unki salaah par nahin ladane kaa faisla kiya?maine apni antaratma par bhi bharosa kiya, mere liye dil kii aawaaj hi sab kuch he
 You sidelined the conscience when the Prime Minister spoke to you during the Bihar Assembly elections and said that the government would fall? The Governor of Bihar had written to the Prime Minister that the Assembly had become defunct and the state government was in a bad state
 
 pradhanmantri ne mujhe moscow main kol kar ke bataaya ki halaat sankat ke str par aa gaye hai
 He wanted to know my opinion and said that he has called a cabinet meeting
 maine apane str par kuch padtaal kii, phir ghante bhar baad unka dobaaraa phone aayaa or unhone cabinet kaa faisla bataaya
 Then i consciously decided
 lekin aapane apni kitaab main to likhaa he ki aap takreeban istipha dene kii kagaar par pahunch gaye the?haa, takreeban, kyonki nyaaypalika ko laga ki main moscow main baith kar faisla le rahaa hum, use nahin pataa tha ki main minute-minute kii khabar rakh rahaa tha
 When the judiciary found the governor guilty, i thought i should resign
 lekin up-raashtrapati videsh daure par the isliye unhen soochna dene main mujhe kuch ghante lag gaye
 During that time i met the Prime Minister, in a long conversation he persuaded me not to resign in the national interest
 maine vaisaa hi kiya
 But many people use this as an excuse to continue in office? In my case it is not so
 mujhe satta main bane rahane kii kya padi he? dobaaraa raashtrapati ban kar mujhe kya hasil hoga? mujhe kisi se kuch nahin chahie
 Today, the most serious threat to the country is corruption
 agar aap pradhanmantrihote to kya lokapal vidheyak paarit karvaa dete?bhrashtachar anwarat prakriya he (hansate hai)
 There is no doubt that Anna (hazare) is fighting an important battle, but if the Lokpal Bill is passed, it will only increase the crowd in jails
 isaki bajaae maine 35 varsh se neeche ke yuvaaon ke liye ek nayaa andolan prastaavit kiya jiskaa naam he, ''main kya de saktaa hum''
 There are only three things in it: Make your mother happy, keep your father away from corruption and save the environment by planting trees
 anna ne jab meraa yah vichaar suna to unhone kaha ki is mantra se nattejey milane main lanbaa vakt lagegaa, lekin unki yantric prakriya se to sirf kaidakhane aabaad honge
 There will be no change in the hearts and minds of the people
 anna hajaare kehete hai ki 15 mantri bhrasht hai
 When you were in office, how much corruption did you see in the government? (laughs) i did not calculate

 kuraishi ne 15 july kii tippanee ko lekar vivaad khadaa karne vaale is mudde par apni khamoshi todate hue kaha ki pillai ke anaavashyak bayanon kaa koi auchity nahin he
 He said that these remarks had vitiated the atmosphere of his talks with External Affairs Minister SM Krishna
 pakistan ke videsh mantri ne i-mail ke madhyam se ek saakshaatkaar main bataaya, ‘‘isamen koi andeh nahin he ki pillai kaa bayaan anaavashyak tha

 desh kii janata unhen haraayegi
 Media should take the name of NDA, why does Modi take the name alone
 ' piem pad kii daavedaari ke sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki samay aane par hamaare ummidavaar kii ghoshnaa ho jaaegi
