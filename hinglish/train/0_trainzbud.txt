 aise main kahin barfili tufaan aa gai to bachane kaa koi rasta hi nahin bachataa
 One such storm took the life of our four soldiers posted in Siachen on 18 November
 magar aaj ham jo sach aapako dikhaane ja rahe hai, wo siachin kii nahin balki duniya ke sabase oonche, sabase thande or sabase khatarnaak pahaad yani everest kii hai
 The Everest where even today the corpses give way to the wandering
 ye duniya kii iklauti jagah he jahaan milastone laashon se banati hai
 What is the secret of the death zone? What is this place where corpses are made milestones? or unhen do gaz zamin bhi mayysar nahin hoti
 Why these dead bodies are made mile stones for humans
 kyon ye saikadon saalon baad bhi kharaab nahin hoti hai
 The answers to all these questions are on this world's highest snowy peak
 ek aisa barfila pahaad jahaan insaan marate to hai
 But their dead bodies never come back from there
 kyonki ye pahaad un laashon ko vahaan se waapas aane hi nahin detaa
 The corpses become 'milestone' land so barren and the pass so high that reaching here can be the aim of life
 magar majaburi nahin
 Because death falls on life here
 ye everest he duniya kaa sabase ooncha, sabase thanda or sabase khatarnaak pahaad
 Every year, about three-and-a-half to three hundred people come here by making a mission to conquer it
 kuch kaamyaab hote hai or kuch naakaamayaab hokar yaheen isi barf main samaa jate hai
 But they do not die even after dying
 ye apni galatiyon se dusron ko sabak dete hai ki jis raste par unhen maut mili
 It is forbidden to visit
 or kabhi kabhi unki laashen yahaan aane vaale parvatarohiyon ke liye google map kaa bhi kaam karti hai
 The corpses show the way more than 308 Mile stones, ie dead bodies are buried on the way of Everest mountain
 jinhen dekhakar yahaan aane vaale parvatarohi apni manzil tay karte hai
 Who are these people? magar usase pehle ye jaananaa zaruri he ki everest par insaan se mile kaa pathar ban chuke ye log aakhir mare kaise
 According to one figure, most of the deaths occurred here due to slips and falls
 or uske baad thand kii vajah se dimag sunn ho jane par logon kii saanse tham gayi
 For 98 years, 'milestone' corpses have not even tried to take these corpses to their loved ones
 kyonki yahaan is barfili chotii se laashon ko neeche zamin par laana naa sirf naammumkin sa he
 It is also more expensive than anticipated
 lihaaza everest kii intazaamia cameti in laashon ko yaheen chhod detii he
 According to an estimate, if one of the 308 corpses lying on Everest can also be removed
 to naa sirf 30 lakh rupayon kaa kharch aayega balki use utaarne ke liye jo log in barfili chotiyon par chadhenge unki jaan jane kaa bhi khatra hoga
 This is the temperature of 16 ° c to 40 ° c when descending from the snowy hill, where we and you cannot even decide to go
 vahaan ye parvatarohi in khadi pahadiyon par chadhane kii zid karte hai
 Which is almost equivalent to committing suicide
 kuch ek had tak jaakar laut aate hai
 So some put their lives at risk of going ahead
 or ye 308 laashen unheen logon kii hai
 Who insisted on fighting the wrath of nature
 marane waalon main kai to aise hai jinhone everest kii chotii ko fatah to kar liya
 But he died while descending from this snowy hill
 green boot ke naam se jaani jaati he laasheneverest kii is pahari par do taraf se chadhaai kii jaati he
 And the dead bodies of climbers have been lying at different distances on both these sides for years
 in laashon ke koi naam nahin he
 Their clothes and shoes have become a symbol of the way
 ye laash green boot ke naam se jaani jaati he
 Which is on the northeast path of Everest
 jo bhartiya parvatarohi shevang paljor kii he
 In 1996, while climbing Everest, he was trapped in an icy storm
 aaj tak shevang kii laash vahiin padi he or green boot ke naam se jaani jaati he
 Like Shevang, many more corpses are on these paths
 jinhen naam se nahin balki unke kapadon yaa juuton se pahachaanaa jaataa he

 England's strong opening move towards opener Alastair Cook's second double put England on the backfoot on the second day of the third Test to take a 232-run lead
 cook ne egebaston main duusare din kaa khel samaapt hone tak 182 ran banaaye hai jisase england teen wicket par 456 ran banaakar pehali pari main vishaal badhat hasil karne kii sthiti main pahunch gaya
 Cook has scored 26 fours in his innings, playing 339 balls
 stump ukhdane ke samay unke saath duusare chor par eon morgan do aasaan jeevandaan milane ke baad 44 ran par khel rahe hai
 The second day was terrible for India, who were on the verge of losing the number one crown due to trailing 0-2 in the series
 bhartiya team kal 224 ran par simat gayi thi jabaki england ne duusare din kul milakar 372 ran banaaye or jabaki bhartiya gendbaajon ko is bich teen wicket hi mili
 He got one of these wickets at Nobel
 iske alaava teen aasaan kaich bhi chute
 Strauss (87) missed out on a century but a 186-run partnership for the first wicket between Cook and him laid a strong foundation for England
 iske baad unhone ian bel (34) ke saath 66 ran or kevin petersan (63) ke saath 122 ran kii saajhedaariyaan kii jabaki morgan ke saath vah abhi tak 82 ran jod chuke hai
 Leg-spinner Amit Mishra gave India the first success but only Praveen Kumar was able to make an impact in the fast bowlers
 unhone ballebaajon ko pareshaan kiya tathaa bel or petersan ko pavilion bheja
 Ishant Sharma and s Sreesanth have bowled over 100 runs but did not get wickets
 bharat ko aakhir main 56wein over kii aakhri gend par vah bahupratikshit safalataa mili jisaki use pehle din shaam se talash thi
 Strauss tried to sweep Mishra's ball but he left his leg stump empty in this round
 gend unako gachha dekar leg stump par lagi or bharatiyon ko bhi iskaa pataa kuch der se chalaa
 Later TV replays showed that Mishra's front leg was ahead of the crease and it was Noble but by then Strauss had returned to the pavilion
 unhone apni pari main 176 gend kheli tathaa 13 chauke lagaaye
 He has not scored a century in the last 14 innings
 pehle do test match main keval 20 ran banane vaale cook shuru main satarkta dikhaane ke baad acchhee lay main dikhe
 He completed his 19th century by taking one run off Praveen's ball
 iske liye unhone 213 gend kheli or 14 chauke lagaaye
 Bell, who scored a century in the last Test, also made a reliable start by hitting three fours in Ishant Sharma's over
 iske baad srisanth baahar jaati gend par unke balle kaa kinaaraa nikaalane main safal rahe
 Bell was on 30 at the time, but Rahul Dravid, who took the most catches in Test matches, leaked a very easy catch in the first slip
 petersan ko shuru main praveen ne thodaa pareshaan kiya lekin vah jald hi apane aakraamak andaaj main aa gayi
 He also hit a six on long on Mishra
 bharat ne 80 over ke turant baad nayi gend lee lekin abhi isse bhi koi asar nahin padaa
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni handed Ishant a new ball but Pietersen hit three fours in his over and removed him from the attack
 chaay ke vishram ke baad petersan puri tarah se haaavee rahe
 Meanwhile, on Sreesanth's ball, India also resorted to DRS for a catch behind the wicket but the ball was then hit by the pad, not his bat and the decision of umpire Simon Taufel proved to be right
 aakhir main bel vaali kahani dohraayi gayi or jo wicket srisanth ko nahin mila use praveen ne apane naam likhvaya
 Pietersen was careless and kept scoring, but he missed on Praveen's straight ball and umpire Steve Davis got his finger off the lbw
 petersan ne apni pari main 78 gend kheli tathaa nau chauke or ek chakka lagaaya
 When new batsman Morgan hit Praveen for two fours, Dhoni gave the ball to Suresh Raina, who in the meantime scored only four consecutive overs from the old 17 overs ball
 is bich duusare chor par gendbaaji kaa jimmaa sambhaal rahe ishanth kii gend par srisanth ne morgan kaa kaich bhi choda jo tab 17 ran par khel rahe the
 After this, in the last over of the innings, Dravid dripped his easy catch in the slip

 The old saying is that the way of power of the country goes through UP
 baat upie kii ho yaa endie kii sattashin saansadon kii lambii fouj isi pradesh se he
 But call it unfortunate or something that UP has become known for rising crime, unemployment, backwardness and now riots instead of development
 sawaal yah ki aakhir upi main raajnneeti kaa swaroop kya he?panchayat ajtak ke paanchaven seshan main charchaa upi kii raajnneeti yani 'politics of upi' par hui
 Included in the discussion were BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi, Congress leader Jitin Prasad, SP MP from Rajya Sabha Naresh Aggarwal and BSP leader Sudhindra Bhadoria
 sawaal: kya milegaa uttar pradesh or uski janata ko?sudhanshu trivedi:bijepi ke pichley piem bhi upi se the or is baar bhi
 The state of UP is sadly windy
 dukh kii baat he ki ham rajya kii simaaon main zyada pravesh nahin kar sakate, lekin apni puri samarthy se upi main kanoon vyavastha ko thik karne or vikaas ko badhaane main yogadan denge
 Question: Congress is so nervous due to defeat in Lok Sabha that Rahul Gandhi is not even coming for campaigning in UP? Jitin Prasad: In the elections, there is defeat and victory
 aaj bhi gaanv-gaanv se congress judi hui he
 Congress has made sacrifices
 ham bhadakaakar raajnneeti nahin kar rahe hai
 We do politics in the name of development
 rahul gandhi ne kamjor se kamjor paristhiti main upi kii kaman sanbhali he

 Uttar Pradesh is the destiny of the politics of this country
 is desh ko agar kisi ne disha di he to wo upi he
 Uttar Pradesh needs help
 lekin dukh kii baat yah he ki centre se madad nahin mil rahi he
 Both UPA and NDA ignored UP, while most of the mps are from UP
 jo bhi desh kaa piem hota he wo upi ke liye alag se baithak bulaata tha
 Indira ji also used to do this
 lekin pichley 10 saalon se aisa kuch nahin hua
 Question: So you are saying that crime is increasing due to this? Naresh Aggarwal: i am not saying that
 lekin centre sarkaar ko aise kadam uthaane chahie jisase upi kii haalat sudhari ja sake
 The central government should take initiative to stop crime in UP

 jitin prasad:loksabhaa main jeet ke baad bijepi 100 din ke andar hi plan bi par aa gai he, jisamen sampradayik hinsa or bhaawanaaon ko bhadakaana he
 The BJP clarifies petty rumors, but remains silent on communal tension
 naresh agarwal:kya kaaran he ki jahaan-jahaan bijepi kii sarkaar he vahaan dange hote hai to bijepi kahati he ki jahaan 10 fisadi se zyada muslim he vahaan dange hote hai
 Sudhanshu Trivedi: If something happens in Kashmir, there is something in Gaya and if there is something in Hyderabad, BJP becomes responsible
 isliye ye bijepi ko badnaam karne kii sochi-samajhi sajeesh he
 Question: Your respected MP Yogi Adityanath says that riots take place where 10 to 30 percent of the Muslims are? jitin prasad:samajawadi party or bijepi kii ladaai main upi barbaad ho gaya he
 Polarization of UP has been done
 sirf vot bantorne kii chintaa he
 The law and order in UP is collapsing, sugar mills are closing, there is flooding, there is no employment, there is nothing in the villages
 sirf varanasi ko chamakaane se kuch nahin hoga
 UP will be good only when you talk about development
 sudhanshu trivedi:congress ke ghadiyaali aansu hai
 Did they make Amethi and Rae Bareli Mumbai in all these years? samaajawaadee party ne dharm ke aadhaar par danga prabhaviton kii list jari kii or ye ham par sampradayik hone kaa aarope lagaate hai
 Naresh Aggarwal: The BJP is on the path of Hindu appeasement and has done the work of selling it to God
 lav india bolo, lav pipul bolo
 Where did this love jihad come from and what is it? sudhanshu trivedi:communist party se kerala ke siem achyutanand ne sabase pehle lav jihad kaa zikr kiya tha
 The BJP and the Sangh did not first use it
 naresh agarwal:to kya agar koi galat shabd bol degaa to aap uskaa istemaal karnaa jari rakhenge
 Question: The leader who comes to power at the Center is afraid of him (mulayam) Naresh Aggarwal: The leader is not afraid, he is more Democratic
 piem videsh main hai or videsh mantri dilli main hai
 Jitin Prasad: Today no minister is independent
 koi mantri kuch nahin kah saktaa he
 There is a fear of a man
 sudhanshu trivedi:haa, is baat kii aazaadee nahin he ki koi piem ke adhyadesh ko saream faad de
 Naresh Agrawal: i personally believe that we should support the PM who has taken the initiative
 raashtra hit main ham unka saath denge
 The countries that were behind us went ahead and we are still stuck on reservation, religion and casteism

 jivan or karm maanav jivan ke do aise abhinn pahalu hai jinhen ek duusare se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa, lekin samasya tab aati he jab vyakti keval apane kiye hue ko sahi maanata he or duusare vyakti kaa kaam use hameshaa galat najar aata he
 However, not every time this perception is proved to be correct, but the feeling of being right makes a rift in a good relationship
 pati patni kaa sambandh vishwaas kii door se bandhi hoti he
 The strength of the relationship depends on each other's cooperation
 agar donon main se koi bhi sirf khud ko sahi maanane lage or duusare kii baton ko galat to yah sambandh chalanaa dubhar ho jayega
 Prof
 Amol Chatterjee, Professor of Philosophy at a evening college in the capital, Delhi, says, "most of us consider our works to be just right
" unhen lagata he ki unki soch sahi he or unhone jo bhi kuch kiya, vah sahi tha
 He always finds fault in the work of another person
 yah maansikta sahi nahin he
 'prof
 Chatterjee says,' It is not that every time the other person is wrong
 har vyakti ko apane halaat ke anusaar faisle karne hote hai
 In such a situation, guessing the right wrong means that we are strengthening our ego somewhere
 agar ahankaar na ho, to hamen apane kaam main hui bhul yaa apana galat faisla saaf samaj main aa jayega
 ' ames kaa naam sunate hi ek bharosa jaag uthta he, yahaan samuchit ilaaj hoga
 Delhi AIIMS also has facilities where patients from all over the country come and they get better treatment
 dilli ames ke tarj par desh ke kai hisson main ames kholane kaa faisla liya gaya or dhire-dhire kai rajyon main ames banakar taiyaar bhi ho gaya he
 But when patients arrive here with hope like Delhi AIIMS, they feel disappointed
 'ajtak' ne patna, raipur or bhopal ames kaa reality check kiya
 Our investigation revealed that even though these hospitals have AIIMS in their names
 lekin yahaan doctoron se lekar aadhunik upkarnon kii baari killat he or marij pareshaan hokar yahaan se duusare aspataalon kaa rukh karne ko laachaar hai
 Even after 5 years, hundreds of people from Bihar go to AIIMS in Patna AIIMS Badhaldilli's largest health institute for their treatment every day and to reduce the same problem in the government of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the lines of Delhi in many cities The exercise to open AIIMS was started
 patna bhi khushnaseeb tha or usase bhi ames kii saugat mil gai
 He finally started working at AIIMS in Patna from 2012 after a delay of 7 years
 netaa ji kaa vaadakuch din pehle kendriya swasthya rajya mantri ashvini choube ne bhi patna ames ko lekar kaha tha ki vah chaahate hai ki patna ames kii swasthya sevaayen itani behtareen kar di jaae taaki bihar ke logon ko apana ilaaj karaane ke liye dilli naa janaa pade
 In such a situation, the question arises that even after 5 years, the health services in Patna AIIMS have become so much better that people of Bihar do not have to go to Kodilli Amson? If you will see the ground reality, then the condition of Patna AIIMS has not been such that even today patients can get treatment for every disease in this institution
 dilli ames ke tarj par banaaya santhaan aaj bhi buniyadi suvidhaon ke bagaiyr hi karyrat he
 Emergency service still not available in Patna AIIMS If we talk about the hospital, then the most important thing here is emergency services, ie emergency services, but even after 5 years in Patna AIIMS, emergency services have not started here
 yahaan par alag se apatkaal vibhaag jarur bana hua he magar karyrat nahin he
 In such a situation, if a patient is brought here in serious condition, then he is referred to Patna Medical College or Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Science from here
 bina 'blad bank' patna amspatna ames main jab apatkaal sevaayen uplabdh nahin he to saath hi troma centre kii bhi kami saaf dekhi ja sakati he
 Even today, blood bank services are not available in Patna AIIMS
 blad bank ke liye alag se ek block kaa nirmaan kiya ja chukaa he magar yah abhi tak karyrat nahin hua he
 Patna AIIMS was constructed thinking that people of Bihar and Jharkhand would be able to come here and get their treatment and that is why 28 operation theaters were built in this big institute
 lekin haalat yah ki aaj ke din keval chaar oparation theatre kaam kar rahe hai
 If sources are to be believed, there is also a shortage of specialist doctors in Patna AIIMS
 304 main se 50 doctors karyratcendre sarkaar ke dwaara patna ames main 304 doctoron or teacheron ke liye pad sweekrut he magar 5 saal biit jane ke baad bhi halaat yah he ki yahaan par keval 50 doctor or teacher karyrat he
 According to the plan, Patna AIIMS was to be made a 1000-bed hospital and this institute has the same capacity but today only 200 beds are available here
 patna ames main aaj bhi shavgrih nahin he jisaki vajah se yahaan par kisi kiaprakritik mrityuho jaati he to uskaa postmortem bhi nahin karaayaa ja saktaa he
 In 'aaj Tak', going inside Patna AIIMS, took stock of the situation and found that even after 5 years, construction work is still going on here
 rojaanaa kai trakon kaa aana janaa laga rahata he jisamen baaluu, cement, eent or saria lod rahata he
 Construction work is still going on at five places of the hospital and everywhere you will see a pile of sand, ballast and rebar
 raipur AIIMS kaa ye he halraipur AIIMS main kareeb saal bhar tak naukari karne vaale medicin vibhaag ke ek doctor ne haal hi main apane pad se istipha de diya
 However, he is currently on notice period
 lihaaja unhone apni pahchaan jaahir naa karne kii shart par 'ajtak' ko bataaya ki unke saathi doctor sirf isliye naukari chhod kar ja rahe hai kyonki sarkaar ne AIIMS kii sthapana to kar di
 But i never looked back again to know his movement
 is doctor ke mutabik maamla sarkaar kii ichha shakti se judaa he
 When the government will not show interest in appointing doctors and staff, then why doctors will work in such institute
 unke mutabik maamla sirf vetan kaa nahin he
 Job satisfaction is also something
 oparation ke liye keval milti he taarikhyahan ek or doctor ne 14 maheene kaarykaal ke baad apane pad se istipha de diya
 According to him neither patients nor they are satisfied with the attitude of AIIMS management and government
 unhone bataaya ki behad simit sansadhano ke chalate marijon ko oparation ke liye date par date dena padataa he
 Many times there is such a situation that many patients have to be returned
 philhal AIIMS raipur main 800 doctoron main se maatr 100 doctor hi tainaat hai
 27 of these doctors are on notice period
 achche sansthaanon se unhen ofer letters kaa intjaar he
 Many doctors have even given their interviews to be admitted to other institutions, they are waiting for the AIIMS management to accept their resignation without interruption
 raipur AIIMS khud bimaarseiinsh raipur main ek darjan badi imaaraton kaa kaam ab bhi jari he, iske chalate vibhinn vibhaagon main naa to ICU ban paae he or naa hi ward
 Even doctors have not been appointed in many important departments
 AIIMS main ek hajaar marijon ke bhartee karne kaa bandobast he
 But due to the lack of half-finished construction work doctors and lack of medical equipment and machines, barely four hundred beds have a presence of patients
 kahaan jaae janata?raipur main ames khul jane se rajya kii janata ko ummid thi ki ab unhen naa kevarchha ilaajamuhaiyaa hoga balki ilaaj ke naam par privet aspataalon kii khuli lut se unka bachaav hoga
 But this is not possible
 ames main doctoron kii bhartee ke baavjood naa to marijon kaa sahi dhang se ilaaj ho paa rahaa he, or naa hi doctor bhi vahaan tik paa rahe hai
 Within few days of joining the job, the doctors available here have resigned and started working in private hospitals in Raipur, in fact due to lack of resources and pressure of patients, such a situation could not be prepared in AIIMS Raipur that the doctors posted here Was able to treat
 yahi haal AIIMS ke medical college kaa bhi he
 Hundreds of patients with intensive care visit these large buildings of AIIMS and return to Beerang
 AIIMS prabandhan kaa apana tarkyaha aspataal ke trama centre main daakhil hote hi doctoron kii suchi darj he
 In most departments, only one doctor is posted
 shesh doctoron kaa naam suchi se is liye nadaarad he kyonki unki niyukti hi nahin ho pai
 AIIMS management has its own logic about this
 raipur AIIMS ke medical suparitendent dow
 Ajay Dani says that 800 posts of various categories of doctors have been approved here
 iske alaava AIIMS prashasan ke sanchaalan ke liye vibhinn vibhaagon main karmchaariyon, technitian, computer oparator, babu, ward boy, store keeper, telephone atendent or sahaayakon samet kareeb 3800 karmchaariyon kaa seoup sweekrut he
 But currently only 100 doctors have been appointed in various departments
 vibhinn shrenee ke kareeb saadhe chaar sau karmchaariyon ko contract basis or out sorcing ke jariye kaam par lagaaya gaya he, taaki vartmaan main sanchalit saamaanya bimariyon se grashit marijon ke chaar sau bed par chikitsa kaa kaam sucharu rup se chal sake
 The release of doctors from here, ICU is also like normal hospitals in the issue of AIIMS, while many advanced machines were claimed to be installed here
 hriday sambandhi bimariyon ke liye bhi koi khaas vyavastha nahin ho pai
 Complicated operations of the heart cannot be done, because there are no specialist doctors
 ames raipur main neurologist, pediatrician, orthopedic sarjan, sitivies sarjan, anesthologist ne jwoining di thi
 But most of the doctors left AIIMS a few days later and went to other private hospitals
 yahi haal plastic surgery or bern unit main tainaat doctoron kaa he
 Doctors joined both the units and went on seeing the ambience of the hospital
 unhone bhi apana istipha ames ko saunp diya
 AIIMS, forced to go to a private hospital, has become the case that due to plastic surgery and tota of doctors in the burn unit, all burn cases are being referred directly to private hospitals
 yahi haal hriday rog se lekar cancer vibhaag samet duusare vibhaagon or faikalties kaa he
 Due to the absence of specialist doctors, patient Ram is confident
 raipur main ames khulne ke baad sirf chhattisgarh hi nahin balki simavarti rajya jharkhand, odisha, uttar pradesh, madhya pradesh or maharashtr ke bhi marij yahaan ilaaj ke liye aate hai
 In such a situation, the presence of doctors in this institute and the environment here is very important
 philhal yah tay nahin he ki itane varshon baad bhi AIIMS raipur main nirmaan kab khatm hoga or kab doctoron kii tainaati puri tarah se ho paaegi
 The situation of Bhopal AIIMS and the condition of Bad Bhopal AIIMS is also similar to Patna and Raipur
 bhopal ames kii neenv atal bihari vaachapeyi sarkaar ne 2003 main rakhi thi
 And since 2012, this hospital is operational for every treatment of patients
 lekin yahaan 15 june 2015 se dector kaa pad khaali padaa he
 Apart from this, there is a huge shortage of staff and doctors in all departments
 aspataal prashasan ke mutabik manjuur 960 bedon main 415 hi marijon ke liye uplabdh hai
 Story of the patient Bhopal AIIMS: a patient told the story of Bhopal AIIMS
 kaise use oparation ke liye bhopal ames laayaa gaya or phir jaan bachaane ke liye unke parijanon ko yahaan se uthaakar unhen privet aspataal le janaa padaa
 Rahisun Nisha, 49 years old, says that he was admitted to Bhopal AIIMS in August 2017, with the hope that it will also have facilities like Delhi AIIMS
 behoshee kii haalat main rahisun nisha oparation theatre main do baar le jaaya gaya
 But the operation failed
 jiske baad rahisun ke pati ashraf ne unhen yahaan se privet aspataal main shift kiya, jahaan unka sahi se upachaar ho paaya
 Against AIIMS 'negligence, a complaint was lodged with the administrative department in Ashraf, which was investigated and the hospital admitted that Rahisun's operation could not be done first in the theater due to infection, and then for the second time due to emergency
 darasal bhopal main immergency or trama centre abhi bhi karyrat nahin he
 The building is standing only the status of AIIMS Nambhopal AIIMS can be gauged from this that emergency patients are sent to private hospitals from here
 critical immergency se jude do vibhaag seva main nahin hai or 10 vibhaagon main koi faikalti hi nahin hai
 Manisha Srivastava, the new medical surrogant of Bhopal AIIMS, says that from June, the remaining 23 more operation theaters will be available for patients
 yahaan ke liye kul 27 oparation theatre manjuur kiye gaye hai lekin abhi 4 hi marijon ke liye uplabdh hai
 Medical students are also angry with the misery, not only are the medical students studying MBBS from here also angry
 unka kahana he ki AIIMS kaa naam par wo yahaan aae the
 He has only been cheated here in the last three years
 yahaan faikalti kii baari kami he jisase unki padhai par asar padaa he
 Not only this, this medical college has been running without a director for the last 3 years

 The President of Nicaragua is in trouble
 raashtrapati danniel ortega par unki beti ne rape kaa aarope lagaaya he

 'raashtrapati kii beti joyilamerica ne raashtrapati ke khilaaf cese daayar kar diya he
 On the other hand, Joyilamerica's mother and First Lady Rosario Murillo of Nicaragua have called the allegations against President Ortega baseless
 vah in aarope ke khilaaf campan bhi chalaa rahi hai
 It is worth mentioning that even before this, Joyilamerica had filed a case in this case in 1998, but then the court dismissed the case giving a clean chit to the President

 But Advocate Keswani feels that Dawood is ready, he will definitely come if the security of the government is assured

 america ke raashtrapati donald trump ne kashmir maamle ko lekar daawa kiya he ki bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kashmir mudde ko sulajhane main america kii madad maangi thi
 Trump said this during a meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday

 On Wednesday, Shibu Soren, president of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, bluntly said that a jmm-led government would be formed in the state after the completion of the 28-month tenure of the coalition government running in the state with the BJP in January, but If the BJP does not agree to this, then the JMM can also tie up with the UPA
 jhamumo adhyaksh shibu sorain ne ranchi se sava sau kilometre dur bokaro main patrakaron se baatcheet karte hue chetavanee bhare swar main kaha ki agle varsh janvari main arjuna munda ke netritv vaali sarkaar kaa 28 maheene kaa kaarykaal puraa hone ke baad jharkhand main har haal main jhamumo ke netritv main nayi sarkaar kaa gathan hoga
 He once again claimed that JMM had an agreement to form the government here for 28-28 months with the top BJP leaders before the coalition government came to power in the state led by Arjun Munda on September 11, 2010 and All parties have to respect it
 is bich ek baar phir pradesh bijepi ke adhyaksh dineshanand goswami ne spasht kiya ki jhamumo ke saath rajya main sarkaar chalaane ke liye 28-28 maah yaa 56 maah sarkaar chalaane kaa koi samjhauta nahin hua tha
 On the other hand, Rajendra Singh, the leader of the Congress Legislature Party in the state, gave a clarion call to the JMM that if the present government falls, there will be no chance of President's rule in the state and the Congress will help in forming an alternative government
 shibu sorain ne daawa kiya ki bijepi ke saath sitambar, 2010 main gathbandhan banaate samay 28-28 maah sarkaar chalaane kaa samjhauta hua tha or iske anusaar munda sarkaar kaa 28 maah kaa kaarykaal agle varsh janvari main puraa hone ke baad ab jhamumo kii sarkaar chalaane kii baari he
 Asked what the JMM would do if the BJP was not ready for a change of power, he said, "we will explore other options, including forming an alliance with the UPA, otherwise we can go to the polls
" ’ shibu sorain ne spasht kiya ki sarkaar banane ke liye unki party kisi bhi anya dal ke saath samjhauta kar sakati he
 Shibu Soren has been repeating the same thing again and again for the last two months that the state will have a change of power after 28 months but on earlier occasions his son and Deputy Chief Minister Hemant Soren handled the case and refused any such agreement
 Was abolished is baar pichley teen dinon main shibu sorain ke bete or upmukhyamantri hemanth sorain ne bhi apane pita ke daawey ko sahi bataaya he or abhi mangalvaar ko dhanbad main unhone do took kaha, ‘yadi guru ji yah kah rahe hai ki bijepi ke saath aadhe aadhe samay ke liye rajya sarkaar ke gathan kaa samjhauta hua tha to vah thik hi kah rahe hai
 There is no question of any other JMM leader speaking against it
 ’hemanth ne kaha ki is samjhaute kaa paalan karte hue munda ko janvari main mukhyamantri kii kursi jhamumo ke liye chhod deni chahie
 Meanwhile, Congress legislator party leader Rajendra Singh, who is looking to take advantage of the growing rift in BJP and JMM by Shibu Soren's statements, said that in the event of Arjun Munda government falling, President's rule will not be allowed in the state
 singh ne jhamumo ko chaara daalate hue kaha ki congress rajya main raashtrapati shashan nahin lagane degi or vaikalpik sarkaar ke liye anya dalon ko samarthan de sakati he
 Earlier, the Congress has been clear that it will not form a coalition government in the state with JMM, but the change in its position has brought warmth in the political atmosphere of the state
 johaar yatra par nikle rajya ke mukhyamantri arjuna munda ne abhi is maamle main kuch bhi kehane se inkaar karte hue kaha ki vah vakt aane par uchit baat kahenge
 Uttar Pradesh Governor Ram Naik gave a controversial statement at an event

 The governor has surrounded himself after this statement

 Raj Thackeray's party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena may not be fighting in this Lok Sabha election, but Raj Thackeray is holding meetings all over Maharashtra
 sabhaaon main naa to wo kisi pratyaashee kaa samarthan kar rahe hai or naa kisi party ke liye vot maang rahe hai
 Despite this, the crowds in his meetings have increased the concern of all parties including BJP, Congress, Shiv Sena, NCP
 haalanki, raaj thakare apni sabhi sabhaaon ko jaagrukta abhiyaan bataakar pradhanmantri narendra modi or amit shah par nishaanaa saadh rahe hai
 Raj Thackeray's rallies in this Lok Sabha election are not at all like traditional rallies
 is baar raaj thakare apni sabhaaon main baqayada power point pregentation kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 In this presentation, he shows videos of old speeches and statements of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 raaj thakare kaa maananaa he ki in video ke jariye wo pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi ke jhuthe vaade benakaab kar rahe hai
 Interestingly, the impact of these rallies of Raj Thackeray is clearly visible on social media as well
 kai aise mim or video soshal media par viral ho rahe hai jinamein raaj thakare marathi main yah kehete hue dikhaai de rahe hai ki 'e lava re to video’yani ki wo video lagaao
 After this, the speech of Prime Minister Narendra Modi starts running
 jise sunaakar raaj thakare bijepi ko koste hai
 These meetings of Raj Thackeray have raised the concern of BJP
 bijepi ko dar he ki kahin raaj thakare unke vot naa kaat de
 So recently BJP has complained to the Election Commission regarding Raj Thackeray's speeches and power point presentation
 vahiin, raaj thakare unki reliyon ko lekar khule taur par yah bhi kah chuke hai ki yadi unki reliyon kaa phayda kisi or party ko hota he to unhen chintaa nahin he
 Because they are neither meeting Congress nor NCP
 aakhir kise hoga raaj thakare kii reliyon kaa phayda?raajnneetik jaankaron kaa kahana he ki raaj thakare bhale in reliyon se raajnneetik phayda hone kii baat se inkaar kar rahe hon, lekin kahin naa kahin iske peeche aane vaale vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye ek badi ranneeti he
 In this regard, Prafull, a journalist from Maharashtra, says that even though Raj Thackeray is cleverly targeting the BJP through his rallies, he is preparing the ground for the assembly elections and through Lok Sabha elections he can easily do this work
 Are getting yadi vidhansabha chunaav main raaj thakare acchhee siten laane main kaamyaab hote hai to wo agle chunaav main apni ek jagah banane main kaamyaab honge
 Because in the elections so far, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena has not achieved much success
 kya shivasena ko majboot kar rahe hai raaj thakare?kuch raajnneetik jaankaron kaa kahana he ki raaj thakare kii reliyon kaa acha or bura asar shivasena par bhi pad saktaa he
 This is because despite the bjp-shiv Sena alliance in Maharashtra, Raj Thackeray is targeting only BJP and its high command in rallies
 isse jaahir hota he ki mushkil main fansi shivasena ko kahin naa kahin raaj thakare phayda pahunchaa sakate hai
 At the same time, one aspect is that if Shiv Sena is not able to get a good win in the Lok Sabha elections, then some leaders from Shiv Sena can also join the hands of Raj Thackeray's Maharashtra Navnirman Sena in the upcoming assembly elections

 Mid-day meal scheme director r Lakshmanan said, after talks with other district representatives of the union, including the chairman of Bihar's Primary School Teachers Association, Brajnandan Sharma, "we have reached a solution after which mid-day meal duty Teachers have withdrawn their boycott
 ’ unhone kaha ki shikshakon ke mid de mile kii nigaraanee karne kii vajah se shikshan kaary baadhit nahin ho, uske liye charanbaddh tareeke se vaikalpik vyavastha kii jaaegi
 Nearly three lakh teachers of Bihar's primary schools were boycotting mid-day meal duty on July 25 from Dharamsati Gandaman village of Mashrakha block of Saran district of Bihar after the death of 23 children after consuming poisonous food on July 16
 That this disrupts their teaching work and the corruption prevailing in this scheme brings them into disrepute

 That is why Lashkar has named it Special Kasab Class
 lashkar kaa maananaa he ki aise oparation ke dauraan jinda pakade jane se behatar he mar janaa
 So that the proof does not touch
 kasaab or uske nau saathiyon ko bhi yahi sikhaaya gaya tha
 But Kasab was the only one who was caught alive by the Mumbai Police
 baad main usapar mukadmaa chalaa or phir 21 november 2012 ko use pune kii yarvada jail main faansee de di gai
 Hanjala was arrested from Kashmir
 Now also introduce you to the terrorist who has revealed the new class of this new school of Hafiz Saeed
 naam he mohammad naved jutt urf abu hanjala
 The new piece of the new batch of Lashkar terrorists
 pakistan ke multan kaa rahane vaala ye vahi naved he jisane lashkar ke special kasaab class kaa khulaasa kiya he
 This is also important because he himself attended that special class
 itnaa hi nahin usase pehle ye jamaat-ud-daawa ke madrase main ye ajmal kasaab se bhi mil chukaa tha
 Naved was arrested on June 20 this year following an encounter with southern Kashmir
 naved ko special kasaab class or zaruri training ke baad aktubar 2012 main uttari kashmir ke keran ke raste kashmir main ghuspaith karaayaa gaya tha
 He was accompanied by 21 more Lashkar terrorists
 2013 kii puri sardi khatm hone tak sabhi 21 aatankwaadi dachigam ke jangalon main rahe
 After this Naved reached southern Kashmir
 jab kasaab se mila hanjalapaanchavin paas naved ke mutabik uskaa pita paak sena kaa ritred driver he
 It was his father who sent Naved and his brother to the madrasa of jamaat-ud-dawa
 giraftaar ke baad jute ne bataaya ki 2008 main mumbai hamale se kuch maheene pehle wo pehali baar kasaab se mila tha
 It was then part of Lashkar's Borivala Shahiwala camp in Multan district of Punjab
 naved jis madrase main rahata or padhata tha kasaab kaa baap usee madrase main bataur kasaai naukari karata tha
 He met Kasab in the same madrasa
 naved ke mutabik choti si is mulaakaat ke dauraan kasaab jyaadaatar khamosh hi tha
 Then he did not know much about Kasab
 magar iske kuch maheene baad hi use pataa chalaa ki kasaab ne mumbai main bada kaam kiya he
 The plot to assassinate Shaukat Gani! According to Naved, after the completion of the training, Lashkar's bosses had chosen him especially for operation in South Kashmir
 use kashmir main police auki ardhsainik balon par hamale kii jimmedaari saunpi gai thi
 According to police sources, Naved killed a police officer in Pulwama in May 2013
 iske alaava june 2013 main dakshini kashmir ke hi taraal, sofian or kulgaam main sena ke camp or police petroling party par hamalaa karne ke maamle main bhi wo shaamil rahaa he
 According to police sources, Naved was also plotting the murder of National Conference MLA Shaukat Ghani from Vachi in southern Kashmir
 magar gani ke aasapaas police kii baari suraksha ke chalate use mauka nahin mil rahaa tha
 Naved was also involved in the sensational shootout inside the Pulwama court complex and the attack on the polling booth during the Lok Sabha elections in April this year before his arrest
 pichley hafte hi sarhad ke kareeb aayaa tha saidpichley hafte hi lagbhag bhartiya sarhad kii dahleez par aakar dastak de gaya tha aatank kaa sabase bada sargana haafiz said
 Hafiz Saeed is said to be seen near Jaisalmer in Rajasthan and then in Kutch and Sindh areas of Gujarat
 ab mana ja rahaa he ki bhartiya sarhad ke najdak said kaa ye daura yun hi nahin he
 Rather, there is definitely some motive behind it
 apane sir par 1 karod america dollar kaa inaam liye ye shaks ek baar phir surkhiyon main he
 
 
 The reason is that this time it has been shown in a very remote village in Pakistan, from where the distance of India is not more than 15-16 kilometers
 
 
 sutron kii maane to in gaavon main haafiz said kii ye maujuudagi yun hi nahin he
 
 
 Rather, this time, he is weaving that nefarious plot of terror from these border villages of India, whose heat India may have to face again
 kya kahati he said kii sakriyata?taarikh gavaah he ki haafiz said jab-jab hindustan-pakistan kii sarhad par pahunchaa he, hindustan main begunaahon kii jaan gai he
 Be it the Mumbai attack of 2008 or the 2013 incident of beheading Hindustani troops
 khufia agenciyon ke paas is baat ke ek nahin, balki dasiyon subut he ki ye sabakuch haafiz said ke ishaare par hi hua he
 
 
 And this is the reason that with the involvement of banned terrorist organization Jamaat ud Dawa, on the outskirts of this leader, all the intelligence agencies along with the Indian Army have been alerted
 sutron kii maane to is baar haafiz said rajasthan ke jaisalmer border ke tanot ilaake se sate kuch pakistani gaavon masalan mithi, bitalaa, islamkot, mirpur khaas or kherpur main dikhaa he
 It is said that this time Hafiz Saeed has specifically warned the Hindu families living in these villages by saying that they will support them in the game of terror played by the Jamaat ud Dawa against Hindustan
 said ne in pariwaron se apane bacchon ko jamaat ud daawa ke aatankwaadi campon main bhejne kii taakid kii he or saafe kaha he ki agar unhen pakistan main rahanaa he to hindustan ke khilaaf is napak khel main saath dena hi hoga
 The United States had recently announced a ban on Saeed and his terrorist organization Jamaat-ud Dawa and said that Saeed's organization is not only against America or a few countries, but against the whole world

 rashtriya mahila ayog ne maharashtra ke mukhya sachiv ko notice jari kiya he
 According to this notice, women of Beed district of Maharashtra have been having their uterus (hysterectomies) only so that their work is not affected and they can avoid menstrual penalties

 Actually, he considers periods or menstruation responsible

 According to 'the Hindu' report, Hajipur village in Maharashtra has livestock harvesting workers

 The migration has also increased due to the increasing drought in the village
 in shramikon main purush or mahilaayein donon shaamil hai
 In that too, contractors choose only women workers without 'womb'
 unke mutabik aisi mahilaayein chhuttiyaan kam leti hai, jabaki masik dharm (menstruating) se hone vaali mahilaon ko zyada chhuttiyaan chahie hoti hai
 Reportedly, it has become a 'rule' in this village that women have to undergo hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) after giving birth to 2-3 children

 dada patel naam ke ek thekedaar ne kaha ki is surgery ke liye mahilaon par jor jabardastee nahin kii jaati, balki wo apni marji se ye kaam karaati hai
 We are given a target that sugarcane be harvested within the stipulated time, so we do not employ menstruating women at the time of sugarcane harvesting
 is report main yah bhi kaha gaya ki jin mahilaon ko ye surgery karaani hoti he wo contractor se hi adwance main paise leti hai or dhire-dhire apni dihadi se katwati rahati hai
 However, according to the institution, "25 years of married women are also undergoing these surgeries and are suffering from hormonal imbalance, mental illnesses and weight gain
" itnaa hi nahin, in mahilaon kaa thekedaar or unke patiyon dwaara yon shoshan bhi hota he
 This situation is worse due to lack of toilets and bathrooms in these farms

 loksabhaa chunaav ke aakhri charan se pehle bengal kii siyasat sulag gai he
 The issue of the demolition of the famous educationist Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar has also been raised amidst the ruckus during the road show of Amit Shah, the national president of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Kolkata
 trinmul congress jahaan bijepi kaaryakartaaon par pratimaa todane kaa aarope laga rahi he, vahiin ab amit shah ne khud kuch tasviir jari kar yah daawa kiya he ki vidyasagar kii murti ko trinmul congress ke gundon ne todaa he
 After this uproar on the streets of Kolkata on the evening of 14 May, Amit Shah told the whole incident in a press conference in Delhi today
 amit shah ne kaha, 'ab tak chunaav ke 6 charan samaapt ho chuke hai lekin bengal ke sivaay deshbhar main kahin koi hinsa nahin hui he
 Mamta Banerjee alleges that the violence is done by BJP
 main mamata banerjee ko bataanaa chahta hum ki aap sirf 42 siton par chunaav lard rahi hai or bijepi har rajya main chunaav lard rahi he lekin kisi bhi rajya main hinsa nahin hui
 While violence occurred in Bengal in all 6 phases, it is clear that TMC is the reason for the violence
 agar bijepi hinsa kar rahi hoti to baaki rajyon main bhi aisa hota'
 Accusing Trinamool of spreading violence, Amit Shah also blamed TMC workers for breaking the statue of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar
 shah ne ek tasviir dikhaate hue kaha, 'is tasviir main dikhaai de rahaa he ki college kaa get band he or bijepi kaaryakarta baahar the
 The gate is closed, not broken
 jahaan pratimaa rakhi thi, wo do kamaron ke andar he
 This incident is at seven thirty in the evening
 college band ho chukaa tha, phir andar jaakar kisne daravaaje khole or murti todi
 The lock of the room is not broken
 phir kamare kii chaabi kisne di
 All these evidences show that the statue has been broken by TMC goons'
 amit shah ne kaha ki mamata banerjee ne hamadardi paane ke liye ishwarchand vidyasagar kii pratimaa ko todane kii sajeesh kii he
 Please tell that Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar was a famous educationist and social reformer and he is highly respected in Bengal
 yahi vajah he ki murti tuutane ke baad mamata banerjee ne turant uniwarsity jaakar halaat kaa jayja liya or puri tiemasi ne is ghatana ko bengal ke gaurav se jodate hue bijepi ke khilaaf morcha khol diya

 The core committee of Team Anna met in Kosambi, Ghaziabad, in which the idea emerged that no one political party should be targeted in the future anti-corruption movement
 kharaab swasthya ke kaaran baithak main upasthit nahin hone vaale anna hajaare par antim nirnay chhod diya gaya
 However, sources said that social activist Medha Patekar and some others argued that the Congress should not be targeted on the Lokpal issue alone
 patekar ne baithak main hissaa nahin liya lekin is bare main apana ek note bhej diya
 Earlier, Team Anna was accused of targeting the Congress in its campaign

 Arvind Kejriwal, Prashant Bhushan and other members attended the meeting in which they discussed future strategy

 We considered future events
 hamane vichaar kiya ki kis tarah andolan ko khadaa kiya jaae
 No decision has been taken because Anna and some members were not here

 Hazare did not attend the meeting as he was not well
 chikitsakon ne unhen salaah di thi ki swasthya ko dekhte hue vah kam se kam ek maheene tak koi yatra nahin karen
 Other key members Kiran Bedi also did not attend the meeting
 bedi ne kaha, ‘mujhe kuch nijee kaaryakramon main janaa jaruri tha

 ’mumbai or dilli main disambar ke ant main hue hajaare ke andolan main logon kii acchhee bheed nahin hone or bhrashtachar virdohi andolan par congress ke kataaksh ke pariprekshya main yah baithak hui
 a few days ago, Kejriwal wrote an article saying that Team Anna is confused about advancing the movement for a strong Lokpal and said that the movement is at a 'crossroads' and a wrong decision on this occasion would be disastrous for it

 com / gdvjabsjry — Lalu Prasad Yadav (@laluprasadrjd) March 6, 2019 Clearly, he is referring to the central and state ruling party
 jad (you) itnaa kose jane ke baad peeche kaise rahati
 Soon after this tweet, the ruling Janata Dal (united) also retaliated and called it Manjure Janata
 jad (you) ke pravaktaa niraj kumaar ne lalu ke twit par palatwaar karte hue kaha ki janata ne hi chaha he ki jisane khud ko garibon ke maseehaa bataakar akut sampatti arjeet kar lee thi,aaj vah hotwar jail ke kaidi number 3351 hai
 He further said that he has not earned anything by doing labor, now be ashamed
 janata aapaki hakeekat jaan chuki he
 All these people are the people
 philhal lalu prasad yadav chaara ghotaale ke kai maamalon main ranchi kii hotwar jail main band hai or unhen kai gambhir bimaariyaan hai jiske kaaran kai maheenon se unka ilaaj ranchi ke rems main chal rahaa he
 Lalu has filed a petition for bail in the Supreme Court 10 days before the High Court rejected his bail plea
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke lihaaj se king mekar lalu kaa baahar aana bahut jaruri he aise main rajd or lalu ,donon kii nigahen supreme court ke faisle par hai
 However, this tweet has increased the stir
 dilli sarkaar main mantri rahe kapil mishra ne doctor kumaar vishwaas ko aam aadmi party (AAP) main chal rahe ghamaasan or unki chuppi ko lekar khulaa patr likhaa he
 Kapil has asked Kumar Vishwas in the letter keeping his opinion on all the issues like hawala business, demonetisation, surgical strikes and goa-punjab elections
 kapil ne kumaar vishwaas kii chuppi ko satya-dharm kii haani bataate hue likhaa he
 
 
 Respected Kumar Bhaiya, where are you staying? Why are you stranded? What's the dilemma? What kind of confusion? In what hope and in what hope? Today i am writing some things openly, there is a little long letter, but i must read it
 kapilne apane patr main kumaar vishwaas ke twit kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki kal aapane twit kiya, 'ham bole to kya hoga?' aapane media main bhi kaha ki aapke bolne se AAP main bhi kuch log he, jo darate hai
 It means something you know and you are not speaking
 kya he wo raaj or aap kyon chhipaakar baithe ho? kya wo raaj bhrashtachar, hawala, kaledhan, rashtriya suraksha se jude hai? aapaki chuppi kisalie? desh-dharm se bada to kuch nahin hota
 Reminding the demonetisation that came into effect on November 8 last year, Kapil Mishra wrote, 'I remember
 
 
 pichley saal aath november ko jab notebandi hui
 
 
 i tweeted immediately after PM Modi announced demonetisation
 
 
 notebandi kii tarif karte hue
 Within 10 seconds of this tweet, you got a call that delete the tweet
 
 
 thodi der main bataata hum kyon? maine delit kar diya
 Then in a while you told that Kejriwal has been silent since the demonetisation and no one has been refused to give any reaction
 'kapil mishrane kumaar vishwaas ko likhaa ki aapane bataaya tha ki shaayad kejariwal kuch logon se poochkar nirnay lenge ki notebandi par kya riection dena he? lagbhag teen din tak party main kisi ne koi riection nahin diya
 Then it was decided that the party would oppose demonetisation
 
 
 saare desh me reliyaan hongi
 
 
 Mamta Banerjee will come to Delhi puure desh me kai reliyaan hui, jahaan party kaa koi janaadhar nahin tha vahaan bhi kejariwal kii reliyaan huin
 The rally at Azadpur Mandi flopped till Delhi, but it was done nonetheless

 com / yfu3whwfjy — Kapil Mishra (@kapilmishraaap) November 3, 2017 Kapil Mishra in his letter has asked Kumar Vishwas whether he did not know where Kejriwal got the money from for the Banaras election? Kapil said, 'during the demonetisation, ED was raided in GK, there were pits of notes everywhere in the mattresses, in the bathroom, on the couch
 jis company par ye chapa padaa, usee company ke ek diarector ne banaras chunaav main kejariwal ke nomination se thik pehle hawala ke madhyam paanch april kii raat 12 baje do karod rupee party main die the
 What more evidence would there be for hawala and black money? Still you are silent
 banaras chunaav ladane jane kaa nirnay, funding or usamen UAE jaise deshon se aaye paison ke bare main aapako sabakuch pataa he?notebandi ke baad hui sargical strike kaa zikr karte hue kapil mishra ne apane patr main likhaa, 'aisa hi sargical strike ke dauraan hua
 First of all, Kejriwal told you to make a video against the army
 aapke manaa kar dene par kejariwal ne wo video khud banaaya
 Even before speaking out against the surgical strike, Kejriwal consulted some outsiders
 notebandi or sargical strike donon ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaane se pehle kejariwal ne kin bahari logon se raay lee, iskaa sach aapse zyada koun jaanata he
 Still you are silent
 iske saath hi dilli sarkaar main purv mantri rahe kapil mishra ne punjab or goa chunaav kaa zikr karte hue kumaar vishwaas ko likhaa ki goa or punjab donon jagah jin logon ne chunaav ladaa, wo khulkar bol rahe he ki funding main baari gadabadi kii gai
 You were in charge of overseas funding
 aapane khud bataaya ki punjab main paison kaa koi hisaab-kitaab nahin rakhaa ja rahaa he
 Don't know where the money is coming from
 itnaa kuch hua or phir bhi aap chup ho
 Along with this, Kapil Mishra in his letter questioned Kumar Vishwas on various issues like fake companies, Kejriwal's brother-in-law, Satyendra Jain's daughter, Nikunj Agarwal's appointment and foreign trips
 unhone kaha ki unhen is bare main sab pataa he or wo ab bhi chup kyon hai? The International Cricket Council (ICC) has decided that cricket in the Indian subcontinent in 2011 will not be played in Pakistan compared to the World Cup
 dubai sthit mukhyalay main jari do divasiy baithak ke pehle din shuukravaar ko isisi kii kaaryakarini ne yah faisla kiya
 The ICC made it clear that Pakistan is being snatched from Pakistan for the World Cup due to security reasons
 website 'crickinfo dot com' ne is sambandh main isisi adhyaksh david morgan ke bayaan ke hawaale se kaha, "pakistan main suraksha kii sthiti bilkul aspasht he
 i think our decision is disappointing but we had no choice but to
 hamaara mukhya uddeshy vishwa cap kaa safal or surakshit aayojan he
 Thinking this, we were forced to take this decision
 ab 2011 vishwa cap kaa aayojan bharat, bangladesh or srilanka main hoga
 Pakistan is denied the right to host it
 " 3 march ko lahore main srilankai khilaadiyon ke kafile par hue aatankwaadi hamale ke baad kai deshon ne pakistan main khilne ko lekar apni chintaa jaahir kii thi
 The ICC also took the incident seriously
 is ghatana main srilanka ke chah khilaadi jakhmi hui the jabaki chah surakshakarmi maare gaye the
 This is the second time Pakistan has been taken away from hosting any international cricket event
 pichley saal sitambar main pakistan main isisi champions trophy kaa aayojan hona tha lekin isisi ne suraksha kaarnon kaa hawala dete hue champions trophy kaa aayojan kahin or karaane kaa faisla kiya
 It is now scheduled to be held in South Africa in September this year
 isisi ke is faisle ke baad pakistan cricket board (pisibi) ko kam se kam 8 se 10 lakh dollar kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padegaa
 He also suffered heavy losses due to being snatched from hosting the Champions Trophy
 haalanki iske liye isisi ne use lagbhag 27 lakh dollar kaa muaavja de diya he
 Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma's breakup has revealed several reasons so far
 is sabhi afvaahon ko darkinar karte hue haal hi main khabaren thi ki anoushka or viraat main koi brallep nahin hua he
 Both of them, due to being too busy with their professions, decided to stay away from each other for some time
 in sabhi afvaahon par chuppi todate hue ab anoushka na kaha ki viraat se unka na koi packp hua he or na hi koi gunjaaish he
 According to the news, Anushka said that she now wants to be alone, she has no intention to patch up
 saath hi unka kahana he ki vah viraat par vishwaas nahin kar sakati hai kyonki unhen dar he ki viraat unka dil dobaaraa na tod den
 Not only this, Anushka does not have time to solve all these things as she is busy in shooting for her film 'sultan' these days
 darasal haal hi main khabar ai thi ki jab viraat ko unketi20 match main 'main of da match'ghoshit kiya gaya tha tab anoushka ne viraat ko phone kar unki is safalataa ke liye badhai di
 According to sources, both of them continued to talk on the phone till late night
 yahi nahin haal hi main viraat ne bhiti20 match main bharat kii jitake chalate anoushka par jokes jari karne waalon ko instagram par munh tod jawaab diya tha
 Seeing this love for Virat, news started coming that both of them have been patched up, but now looking at the new update in this love body, Majra seems to be something else
 trainon main varisht nagarikon ko die ja rahe cote par durupyog kii shikaayat milane par rail prashasan kii najar ab tedi ho gai he
 The new rule will apply to prevent misuse in the name of quota of senior citizens
 varisht nagarikon ko ab tikat booking ke dauraan umr kaa pramaan dena hoga
 Ticket reservation will be done only on showing proof koi yatri agar galat pramaan dikhaata he to uski arakshit berth nirast kar di jaaegi
 Till now, such tickets were available, it is worth mentioning that till now no age certificate had to be given on the purchase of any railway reservation center or online ticket in the railway
 varisht naagarik ke liye loar berth bhi canform ho jaati thi
 With this, men get 40 per cent fare for traveling when they are above 60 years and 50 per cent for women above 58 years
 yatra ke dauraan varisht nagarikon ko apana aayu praaanpatradikhanaa hota tha
 In such a situation, while taking reservation, senior citizens used to take advantage of the quota by showing their age incorrectly
 ab milegi jaruratmandon ko sityatra ke dauraan agar titii pakad letaa tha to yatri jurmaana dekar batch jate the
 Not only this, in the event of not showing the age certificate, the differential fair was collected from the passengers and they were given seats, causing loss of railway revenue and the seat was not available to the needy
 is cote main yatriyon ke dwaara durupyog hone kii shikaayat milane pararelway board ne ab niyam kade kar die hai
 According to the new rules of the Betticklerailway board, the tickets can now be booked as before and an age certificate will have to be given during the journey itself
 yadi yatri aayu praaanpatr na de sakaa to use ab betikat mana jayega
 Railways will now collect fine without such tickets from such passengers
 saath hi uski seat bhi nirast kar degaa
 The Railway Board has also sent the order of the new rule to IRCTC and CRIS
 railway ke varisht adhikariyon ke anusaar, varisht nagarikon ko adhik suvidha dene or railway ko rajasav haani se bachaane ke liye yah nirnay kiya gaya he
 China has announced that its Foreign Deputy Minister Kong Shuanyu is in Islamabad to discuss the heightened tension between India and Pakistan after the Pulwama terror attack
 china ne aisa maahaul banane kii jarurat bataai jisamen pakistan anya pakshon ke saath sahyog kar sake
 Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the purpose of vice-foreign Minister Kong's visit to Islamabad is to approach Pakistan regarding the situation involving both India and Pakistan
 unhone kaha, 'china is kshetra main shanti evam sthirataa ko badhaava detaa rahaa he, hamen ummid he ki pakistan or bharat dostana sambandh banaae rakhenge
 'it is worth mentioning that after the death of 40 soldiers of this paramilitary force in the suicide attack on CRPF convoy in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir on 14 February, tensions in India and Pakistan have increased considerably
 aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ne is hamale kii jimmedaari lee thi
 Amid growing resentment, the Indian Air Force launched an airstrike on 26 February in a terrorist hideout of Jaish in Balakot, Pakistan
 iske agle hi din pakistan vayusena ne javaabi karrwai kii or hawaii hamale main bharat ke ek mig-21 vimaan ko gira diya or bhartiya payalat abhinandan vardhaman ko hiraasat main le liya
 Pakistan handed over Abhinandan to India on Friday
 china ne bharat or pakistan se baar-baar apil kii he ki ve sanyam baraten, usne bharat se kaha he ki vah antarrashtriya sahyog ke jariye aatankwaad ke khilaaf apni ladaai lade
 Lu said, 'I hope that both sides can show a little bit of goodwill, little by little, both can embrace each other, resolve their differences properly through negotiations
 china unke bich vaarta ko badhaava dene ke liye rachanaatmak bhoomika nibhaayega
 ' chori kii vaardaaton ke bare main to aapane bahut suna hoga, ghar ke saamaanon se lekar heere-jawaharaat churaane vaale choron ko aapane dekha bhi hoga, lekin kanpur main anokhi chori hui he
 Here the thieves broke three locks of the house and stole the German Shepherd dog
 kanpur menchoriki is vaardaat main teen choron ne teen-teen taale tod daale, do-do baar ghar ke chakkar lagaae, lekin ghar kaa koi bhi keemtee saamaan chuaa tak nahin
 They just stole a German Shepherd dog puppy
 yah pilla ek transporter vineet singh kaa tha
 Kanpur police are now searching for the steals who steal the puppy with the help of CCTV footage
 upi police ke liye yah vaardaat koi bada chalange bhi nahin he, kyonki isse pehle vah mantri ajam khan kii bhais dhundhakar chor pakad chuki he
 So, on the recommendation of the Governor, he is also engaged in searching for the rooster and its thieves
 vineet singh abhi kuch din pehle hi apane ghar main ek german shefrd kute kaa pilla kharid kar laae the
 For this he also built an iron fence
 somvaar subah jab vineet sokar uthe to unhone dekha baade se kutta chori ho chukaa tha
 CCTV cameras were installed in Vineet's house
 unhone turant recording check kii to yah dekhakar hairaan rah gaye ki raat main teen chor unka kutta chura le gaye hai
 Surprisingly, the thieves had broken not one or three locks to steal the dog and the most interesting aspect of this incident was that the thieves had just stolen the dog
 baaki ghar ke kisi saamaan ko unhone haath tak nahin lagaaya tha
 The police saw in the CCTV footage that the first three thieves come and stop for a while, then they go to get something, then they come back and break the three locks and steal the dog
 vineet ne kakadev thane main is pilla chori kii report darj karwaai he
 Police has registered a report against three unknown thieves
 police ab sisitivi footage ke aadhaar par choron kii talash kar rahi he
 The police also believe that the thieves may be familiar to the people of this house, because only then they can know about the house

 pradhanmantriimran khanko ek maheene ke andar tagada jhatka tab laga jab unki sarkaar ke sansadeey kaary salaahkaar babar awan ne apane uparabhrashtacharka maamla darj hone ke baad mangalvaar ko apane pad seistifade diya
 The first blow to Imran Khan's government
 apana pad chhodte hue awan ne twit kiya, 'sansadeey kaary mantralay se apana istipha saunpane ke liye pradhanmantri awaas gaya tha
 The rule of law starts with me
 aapako dhanyavad diya
 Just hours before the resignation of Prime Minister Imranke's resignation, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) filed a corruption case against Awan in the accountability court in Islamabad over the delay in the Nandipur project
 sthaneey media reports ke anusaar ravivaar ko is maamle main awan se teen ghante ke liye poochtacha bhi kii gai thi
 The project was delayed during the 2008–2013 rule led by the Pakistan-based People's Party (PPP) and Awan was then Minister of Law and Justice
 is istife se kuch din pehle pradhanmantri imran khan ne twit kiya tha ki unki sarkaar bhrashtachar mitaane ke liye drudh sankalp he or iske liye shashan pranali kii style ko badla jayega
 Such measures will be discovered, which will reduce corruption
 aam chunaavon main ab ek saal se kam samay bachaa he or in chunaavon main berogari ko mudda banaaya janaa tay he
 The Opposition has been raising it for a long time and now Prime Minister Narendra Modi has responded that the country has been given plenty of jobs during the last four years but new jobs are not visible in the figures
 sawaal uthta he ki kya desh main berogari ke sawaalon ko aankadon kii bahes main uljhaakar kamjor karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he? kam se kam pradhanmantri ke bayaan or bijepi shasit rajyon se aa rahi safai se to yahi lagata he
 Before the Prime Minister's statement on the job statistics, the bjp-ruled Chhattisgarh leader and technical education minister in the state government PP Pandey was also questioned
 peepi pandeya, jo rajya main khud rojgaar karyaalay (employament exange) ke aankadon ke liye jimmedaar hai, ne kaha tha ki rajya sarkaar ke aankadon par bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Significantly, for the last 14 years, Chhattisgarh has a BJP government under the leadership of Raman Singh
 ise bhi padhein
 
 
 Will the Modi government stake Navaratna companies to save drowning banks! PP Pandey argues on the back of his statement that the youth in the state write their name in the employment center of the government as soon as they reach the minimum qualifying age of employment 
 lekin naam likhavane ke kuch hi dinon baad vah yaa to ucch shiksha ke liye chalaa jaataa he or use rojgaar kii jarurat nahin rahati, yaa phir vaikalpik rojgaar athwa swarozgaar ke jariye apana kaarobaar shuru kar detaa he
 Such people do not go to get their name removed from the employment center of the government
 bataur rajya sarkaar ke is vibhaag ke mantri peepi pandeya ne daawa kiya ki iske chalate rajya sarkaar ke berogari aankade vaastavik aankadon se bahut adhik anke jate hai lihaaja sarkaar ke in aankadon par bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Now after this statement from Chhattisgarh, the Prime Minister of the country also questions the unemployment figures in the country
 pradhanmantri kehete hai ki bhala aisa kaise sambhav he ki rajya sarkaron dwaara prati varsh lakhon kii sankhya main nai naukari dene ke baad desh main berogari ke aankade itane adhik hon?ise padhein
 
 
 LIC in crisis, do not get drowned by this step of Modi government
 Your insurance money, the Prime Minister claims that the system of counting jobs in the country is meaningless at the present time and in the current era of new jobs created in the new economy of new India
 This old system is not calculated
 isi ke chalate pradhanmantri vipaksh ke aaropon ko sire se khaarij karne kii jagah daawa kar rahe hai ki vipaksh kaa aarope sarkari aankadon par aadhaarit he
 Therefore, the opposition cannot be held responsible for this because the government's system itself is not sufficient to accurately collect the actual data of employment and unemployment in the country
 gauratlab he ki saal kii shuruyaat main desh ke pradhanmantri ne 'pakora rojgaar' kii baat kar raajnneetik bhuuchaal khadaa kar diya tha
 Not only did the opposition circle the BJP government on this issue, this statement of the Prime Minister was also in the headlines on social media
 is bayaan ke baad congress netaa or purv kii upie sarkaar main pradhanmantri rahe manmohan singh ne bijepi par jhuthe or atishyokti bhare vaadon ke sahare satta par kabiz hone kaa aarope lagaaya
 Manmohan Singh said that the BJP promised to give 1 crore jobs per year in the 2014 general elections, while the BJP government has proved to be a complete failure even after giving power to 2 lakh jobs
 ise bhi padhein
 
 GST kii kyon ho rahi he itani aalochana? modi ne bataaya napha-nuksaanain vaadon se itar vitt varsh 2016-17 ke aarthik surveykshan ke aankadon ke mutabik desh main berogari dar vitt varsh 2013-14 ke 4
 From 9 per cent level to 5 per cent in 2016-17
 vahiin july 2014 se disambar 2016 tak desh main kul 6 lakh 41 hajaar nai naukariyaan paidaa kii gayi
 According to the data of the Ministry of Labor, more than 1 million jobs were created in the country during July 2011 to December 2013
 swaabhaavik he ki in aankadon ko vipaksh main baithe raajnneetik dal aam chunaavon ke dauraan bhunaane kii koshish karenge

 But this time the heat has knocked and there is no news of Rooh Afza

 Just meet
 
 
 , ye he india meri jaan, jindagi kaa test badalata he, jab india ghulata-miltaa he
 Ruh Afja live dissolve '
 lekin is baar na to vigyaapan dikh rahaa he or na hi ghar-ghar kii pasand ruh afja uplabdh he
 It is reported that production has been affected due to a mutual dispute between the owners of the company, Hamdard, which makes Rooh Afza
 haalanki company is tarah kii khabar ko khaarij kar rahi he
 But at the moment the company says something, Rooh Afza is missing from the market
 dukandaaron kaa kahana he ki order ke baavjood company supplai nahin kar rahi he
 In this case, the real reason is not clear
 is masale ko lekar jab hamane hamdard company se baat kii to company kaa kahana he ki plant main technical kharabi kii vajah se ruh afja kaa production roak diya gaya tha
 The company says that from next week onwards, Rooh Afza will again be able to meet customers easily
 kyonki plant main teji se production chal rahaa he or agle hafte tak bazaar main uplabdh kara diya jayega
 Apart from India, there is a lot of demand for Rooh Afza in Pakistan and Bangladesh
 ab jab company ek hafte main ruh afja aasaani se milane kii baat kah rahi he to graahakon main ek ummid jaagi he
 It is noteworthy that production of Ruh Afza started in 1906 by Hakim Hafiz Abdul Majid
 ab abdul maajid kii teesri peedi yani unke pote company ko sambhaal rahe hai
 Many products are available in the market as compared to Rooh Afza, but even today it is the first choice of every household

 bharat kii sansad main billrajyasabha main aaj is silsile main privet member bill par charchaa hogi
 It is expected that BJP leader Subramanian Swamy, Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi and nominated MP KTS Tulsi will express their views on the discussion
 bill ko maujuuda bajet satr ke dauraan nirdaleey sadsy rajeev chandrashekhar ne pesh kiya tha
 In the bill, Chandrasekhar has demanded that countries like Pakistan, which continuously promote terrorism, should be given the status of a terrorist country and all kinds of relations with such countries should be broken
 sarkaar ke samarthan par sawaalhalanki media reports ke mutabik chandrashekhar ke is bill ko grih mantralay kaa samarthan milane kii ummid behad kam he
 In the opinion of experts, the Modi government may have shown tough attitude towards Pakistan
 lekin kisi desh ke saath aarthik or rajanyik sambandh puri tarah todna koi aasaan kaam nahin he
 Also, this happens less often when governments support private member bills
 uri hamale ke baad bharat main pakistan ko dehshatgard mulk ghoshit karne maang ne phir jor pakadaa tha
 The US has also suffered the brunt of Pakistan's duplicity policy on the motion of the Parliament in the US Parliament
 america sansad ke sadsy ted po ne bhi pakistan ko aatanki desh ghoshit karne se judaa prastaav rakhaa he
 Ted Poe is also a member of the US Parliament's sub-committee on Terrorism
 bill pesh karte hue po kaa kahana tha ki pakistan naa sirf gaiyr-bharosemand sahyogi he, wo saalon se pakistan ke dushmano kii saraparasti karata aayaa he
 According to Poe, from giving asylum to Osama bin Laden to instigating the Haqqani network, Pakistan has proved that it is with the terrorists
 agar bill paas hota he to raashtrapati trump ko 90 dinon ke bheetar is baat kii report pesh kerani hogi ki kya pakistan ne antarrashtriya aatankwaad ko samarthan band kiya he yaa nahin
 After this, the US Secretary of State will give a detailed report, in which the final opinion of the US Government will be given on this issue

 ' Here for some time it has been surprising for many how Bhagat Singh became more famous and popular than other revolutionaries who sacrificed their lives for the sake of the country
 unhen faansee par chadaaye jane ke kuch hi dinon ke bheetar jawaharlal nehru ne khulkar hairat jataai thi ki “ek ladke kii mahaj ek parchi achaanak oonchi chalaang lagaakar itani mashhoor” kaise ho gai? faansee kaa fanda akele unheen ke gale main nahin padaa tha
 His friends Sukhdev and Rajguru were also hanged along with him
 magar unki faansee ke maheenon pehle se hi unhen “bhagat singh tathaa anya” kaha jane laga tha
 Why and how did he get more preference than his fellow martyrs and important members like the Chandra Shekhar Azad of HSRA (hindustani Socialist Republican Army)? Some of the answers to this question are found in the picture of Bhagat Singh with a hat and in a non-minor campaign run by keeping it in the center
 yah tasviir kaaphi had tak studio main khinchvaai jane vaali paaramparik tasveeron kii tarah hi he
 While photographing, only 21-year-old young revolutionary Bhagat Singh is staring at the camera with calm eyes
 kuch is andaaj main maano ve apane khilaaf lagaae jane vaale baari-bharkam aaropon ko lalkaar rahe hon
 The accusation was that they were "conspiring to wage war against His Majesty the Emperor and denying him the sovereignty of British India"
 
 
 ”bhagat singh ko maaloom tha ki ye aarope unhen maut kii sajaa kii taraf le jaaenge
 Despite this, he was absolutely calm and restrained with a hat on his head
 yah tasviir diler rashtrawaad kaa pratik ban gai
 It was widely used in poster art and calendars
 dekhte hi dekhte yah us jamaane ke shahari falak par har taraf dikhaai dene lagi
 On cars and billboards, in markets, in posters and in books
 yah tasviir is kadar har ore dikhaai dene lagi thi ki isaki tulana aksar alberto corda ke haathon khinchi gai che gwera kii mashhoor tasviir se kii jane lagi
 Both of them looked beautiful from the camera's eye and reflected in them the romance, idealism and sacrifice that is the hallmark of revolutionaries
 vidambnaa hi kahenge ki donon tasveeron ko is tarah hathohath liya gaya ki ve apane aitihaasik sandarbh se cat gayi
 In Bhagat Singh's case, some reason for this is that there has been a lot of uncertainty about the purpose and purpose of this picture being taken
 kuch logon ne maan liya ki yah ek suraksha paas par chipkaane ke liye khinchi gai thi
 Others speculated that it was pulled by the police immediately after his arrest in 1929
 lekin donon hi baaten sahi nahin hai
 The poster of the April 12, 1929, hidden among the pages of Bade Mataram (courtesy of the National Archives of India) This photo of martyrdom Bhabhagat Singh may leave its impact on many viewers for many different reasons
 
 
 unki noujvaan khubsuurati, unki sateek or ekatak najar, unka fashneble hat, thodaa-sa jhukaakar lagaaya gaya, vagairah
 But think of this picture in the vocabulary of philosopher Roland Barth, then "that one thing which rises from the board, the arrow is released from it and makes me rip", it is sure to stare into our eyes
 This impudent young man will be hanged — and he himself knows this
 tasviir is ehsaas ke saath or bhi zyada asardaar ban jaati he ki bhagat singh ne unki takadir kaa faisla karne ja rahi british india kii hukumat ko lalkaarane se pehle ise saaf-saaf siyaasi ranneeti ke taur par khinchvaaya tha
 So this picture can be seen in such a way that it first created that role and then became a part of it itself, in which he was accepted all-round as a martyr

 Apart from Bhagat Singh staring straight in the eye, the second most attention-grabbing thing in this picture is his stunning and stylish but apparently western hat
 sitambar, 1928 main jab giraftaar se bachane ke liye bhes badalanaa jaruri ho gaya tha, bhagat singh ne is hat ko pahanane kii khatir apane kesh or pagadi ko tilanjali de di thi
 This hat became his identity after the picture became famous
 unki pagadi pahani hui tasviren to abhi kuch saal se hi lokapriy hui hai
 It is worth noting that in the 1930s, his Sikh identity was given due consideration

 The talk of sustainable picture martyrdom permeated Bhagat Singh
 unhone thaan liya tha ki unki akaal maut ke saath hi british samrajyavad ke khilaaf unki ladaai anjaam par pahunch jaaegi
 He had refused to marry and had taken a pledge to his close friend Jaydev Gupta that he would take care of his family in his absence
 unhen samaj thi ki shahid kaise banaae jate hai
 His work as a journalist shows that he was very keen on using photographs to add life to the story
 maut kii sajaa par kendrit “chand kaa faansee ank” ke liye saamagree jutaney main unhone sahaayta kii thi
 In this, he wrote articles on many revolutionaries and took special care that photographs should be printed with the article
 unke lekhon se yah saaf jaahir hota he ki unhen shahadat kii takat kaa gaharaa ehsaas tha
 Shortly before he was hanged, fellow prisoners sent him a note asking if he wanted to stay alive
 unka jawaab tha-“meraa naam hindustani inkulab kaa pratik ban gaya he
 
 
 If i climb on the gallows hanging smilingly, then this will inspire the Indian mothers and they will also inspire their children to become Bhagat Singh

 Then it will be impossible for imperialism to face the flood of revolution

 twitor par uma bharti ne kaha he ki unhone jo kuch bhi kaha he wo tathyaatmak rup se bilkul sahi he or chubhane vaala bhi he
 Uma Bharti said that her statement in the media was being called a 'spoiled speech'
 ve sirf tathy bataa rahi hai
 The fact is that Robert Vadra faces corruption charges and is out on bail
 jamaanat kaa matlab hota he aparaadh kii ardhasweekruti
 Bail does not mean a clean chit
 aisi sthiti main unki patni kya kehlaayengi, maine vahi kaha he
 This family should learn this lesson that they are not incarnations of God and we as people of India are not their subjects
 wo jaisaa bolenge, unhen vaisaa sunanaa padegaa
 i have not answered the brick with a stone, but with a pebble that hit the right target
 is tarah ke ilaaj kii donon bhai-bahan ko sakht jarurat he— Chowkidar Uma Bharti (@umasribharti)april 17, 2019kendriya mantri ne sawaal kiya ki jab robert wadra kii sampatti main betahasha ijapha hua to kya unki patni isse anjaan thim? aap to yahi badi baat maan lijie ki maine unako us chori main bhagidaar nahin kaha
 It is true that i must be suffering from this, but when our Prime Minister was called by Congress leaders as 'suit-boot chor' and both these siblings called 'chowkidar Chor', how much trouble would we have? Then the mind and soul get filled with trouble and anger
 uma bharti ne kaha ki is parivaar ko yah sabak sikh lenaa chahie ki wo bhagwaan ke avatar nahin hai or ham bharat ke log inaki praja nahin hai
 They have to listen as they speak
 maine eent kaa jawaab pathar se nahin diya, sirf ek kankad se diya he jo ki sahi nishane par laga
 Both siblings are in dire need of such treatment
 gauratlab he ki ek din pehle hi uma bharti se patrakaron ne sawaal poocha tha ki is chunaav main priyanka gandhi kya asar daal sakati hai
 In response to this, Uma Bharti had said that how will people see her husband who is accused of theft? How is the thief's wife viewed? ek chor kii patni ko jis najar se dekha jaataa he, hindustan usee najar se unhen dekhegaa
