 The Aam Aadmi Party surrounded the BJP on this issue and asked why MP Manoj Tiwari is favoring Max Hospital
 What is the deal for them? Aam Aadmi Party national spokesperson Dilip Pandey said that the way the tough decision taken by the Kejriwal government of Delhi on Max Hospital has been reversed, it shows that the people of BJPK are sitting behind the curtains through the Lt
 Governor We are saving these health mafias and bypassing the interest of the people of Delhi
 saurabh bharadwaj ne kaha, ‘jis kathith nishpaksh afasar ne dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar ke is faisle ko palatate hue maiks shalimaar baag ko raahat di he

 'dilip Pandey asked,' Why did Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari stand in favor of Max Hospital? We had asked even then and even today, what is the deal with BJP leader Manoj Tiwari's Max Hospital? 'how are these people? Why does bjp's heart not beat the people of Delhi? Why do these people stand with big mafias every time? The government of the Aam Aadmi Party of Delhi will continue to take decisions in the favor of the common people of Delhi and the common man in the same way as we have chosen the people of Delhi and we will continue to work in the same way in favor of the people of Delhi

 ) Former England captain Nasir Hussain believes that India suffered the expense of turning wickets in the recent Test series as the England spinners fared better

 Jammu and Kashmir Police has arrested a Lashkar terrorist Adil alias Sandeep Sharma
 jammu-kashmir police ke aiji munir khan ne ek press conference kar isaki jaankaree di
 Sandeep Sharma is a resident of Muzaffarnagar in UP

 Sandeep Kumar was also involved in the attack in Kashmir, in which six policemen were killed
 tippaniyan Police officer Munir Khan said that video documents clearly show that Lashkar is also running a criminal gang, which carries out robbery and other criminal activities in the bank
 sandip kumaar kaa istemaal aatankwaadi atm lut main kiya karte the
 Along with this he was involved in three encounters of Lashkar, of which Anantnag is also one
 police ne jaankaree di ki ab hamen pataa he ki bank lut main koun shaamil hai
 We are catching them one by one
 shuruyaat main sandip kumaar apradhi tha, lekin jaise hi vah lashkar ke sampark main aayaa to usne bank or atm lut ko anjaam dena shuru kar diya
 Sandeep Kumar was said to be a close associate of terrorist Bashir Lashkari, who was shot dead on 1 July
 police adhikari munir khan ne bataaya ki video dastavej saaf-saaf bataate hai ki lashkar aapraadhik gang bhi chalaa rahaa he, jo ki bank main lut or anya aapraadhik gatividhiyon ko anjaam detaa he

 mukhyamantri yogi ne pichley hafte pradhanmantri modi se mulaakaat ke baad varanasi main adhikariyon par gaaj giraane kii taiyaari puri kar lee he
 The CM spoke of stern action against the guilty officers for not completing the major construction schemes run by the central government in Varanasi even after three years
 rajya sarkaar main sutron ke mutabik mukhyamantri ne varanasi se jude teen bade projects ko abhi tak puraa nahin kar paane ke baad sarkari vibhaagon par dabaav banane kii koshish kii he
 The three important projects that the Chief Minister is particularly focused on include the widening widening project from Varanasi Airport to the city, the construction of a new ring road for the city and the construction of a major flyover in the heart of the city at a cost of Rs 776 crore
 khasbaat he ki beete hafte pradhanmantri modi se mulaakaat ke baad siem yogi ne piem ke chunaav kshetra se jude in projects ko june 2018 tak puraa karne ke liye adhikariyon ko hidaayat di
 Significantly, it is believed that Prime Minister Modi can visit Varanasi in June and that is why the state government wants to complete the pending work of the city
 ise padhein: yogi kii branding se modi ke gujarat jaisaa chamakegaa upi?rajya sarkaar ke aankadon ke mutabik varanasi ke nae ring road kaa kaam philhal 51 fisadi puraa hua he vahiin airport se shahar tak chadak chaudeekaran kaa project 71 fisadi puraa kiya ja chukaa he
 At the same time, the work of flyover under construction in the middle of the city is stuck and due to this the traffic system in the city has become very bad
 in sabhi nirmaan projects ko kendra sarkaar ne 2014 main hi shuru kar diya tha lekin beete ek saal se in projects kii dedline main ijapha kiya ja rahaa he

 saath hi varanasi ko do pramukh shahar sultanpur or gorakhpur se jodne ke liye do naishanal hive ke kaam bhi puraa nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 People associated with this project claim that till now the Varanasi administration has not given land to the National Highway Authority by acquiring land for this work

 When the results of the Uttar Pradesh PCS-2011 main examination came in July last year, he also brought a storm with him
 uttar pradesh lok seva ayog kii bhartiyon main lagaataar dhaandhlee kaa aarope lagaate aa rahe chaatro ke sabar kaa baandh achaanak tut gaya or elahabaad kii sadakon par jamkar bavaal hua
 The bullets were fired, the heads were broken, the glass of the buses were broken and there were arrests
 chaatro kaa aarope tha ki duusare imtihaan to apni jagah hai, lekin uttar pradesh ke sabase bade pisies imtihaan tak main puri tarah ‘‘yadavvaad’’ chalaa he
 The students accused the commission chairman Anil Kumar Yadav of bias for such results
 yadav in aaropon se batch bhi nahin sakate the kyonki ayog ke adhyaksh ke naate kisi bhi pariksha parinaam kii antim jimmedaari unheen kii banati he
 Later Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav changed the policies and the students returned to their rooms in the hope of justice
 iske baad disambar 2013 main pisies-2011 kaa final rigelt saamne aayaa or chaatro kaa bharosa phir tut gaya
 The Commission knew that these results would bring a new war, so the Commission made public the numbers after a month before cleaning them, and that too in such a way that a student can only see their numbers, that too with a password
 yani uttar pradesh pisies-2011 main kya gorakhdhandha hua, ise badi safai se chupa liya gaya
 But after four months of investigation, India Today opened the Commission's SIMSIM door and reached the racket of numbers found in the exam
 india today ne pisies-2011 main safal hue sabhi 389 abhyarthiyon ke aadhikarik ankapatr kii pratiyaan hasil kin, jo na to artiai ke jariye di ja rahi hai or na hi koi chaatr kisi duusare chaatr ke ank ayog kii website par dekh saktaa he
 However, the two facts were the most surprising among the PCS-2011 results
 pehla-anya pichhadaa varg main chaynit 86 chaatro main se kareeb 50 chaatr yadav jati ke rahe
 Even more shocking was the fact that - except for a few exceptions, successful candidates of Yadav caste got between 135 and 140 out of 200 in the interview
 140 ank kaa aankada isliye bhi myne rakhata he kyonki ayog main pichley kuch saal se parampara rahi he ki chaatro ko saakshaatkaar main 80 se 140 ke bich ank die jate hai
 If someone gets less than 80 or more than 140 marks, then the chairman of the interview board makes his special comment on it
 yani bina kisi atirikt javabdehi ke saakshaatkaar main 140 tak ank die ja sakate hai
 It was a coincidence in the examination result that students of Yadav caste whose marks were less than all other students in the main examination, also managed to get maximum marks in the interview
 duusari ore saamaanya varg ke chaatro ko saakshaatkaar main ausatan 115 ank, gaiyr yadav obisi jatiyon ke chaatro ko ausatan 110 ank or anusuchit jati-janajati ke chaatro ko saakshaatkaar main ausatan 105 ank mili
 PCS topper Himanshu Kumar Gupta also got only 115 marks in the interview (see Tables 1, 3 and 4)
 yahi nahin, saamaanya shrenee main jo obisi category ke chaatr apgrade hue hai, ve saare chaatr bhi sanyog se sirf yadav jati ke hai
 If the Yadav students selected in the general category are merged, the total Yadav students reach 54 (this number of successful Yadav candidates is based on the Yadav word associated with their surname and in some cases the information collected
 vaise hi aankade main maamuli sanshodhan kii gunjaaish hameshaa bani rahati he)
 Apart from interview marks, questions are also being raised on the scaling system being adopted in the main examination
 scalling vyavastha isliye apanaai jaati he ki ganit or vigyaan jaise kai vishyon main kala sankaay ke kai vishyon kii tulana main zyada number die jate hai
 To give uniformity to this variation, the actual scores obtained by the student are modified according to the scaling formula
 ayog pariksha ke vigyaapan ke samay is formule ko prakashit karata he
 In the words of Vicky Khan, who is preparing for the competitive exam, "this one-page formula can be understood by the common man just as cricket lovers understand the duckworth-louis formula
" samajhane se zyada us par bharosa karnaa hota he
 "but this trust is also broken in PCS-2011
 mukhya pariksha ke hindi ke paper ko len to ek chaatr ko pehle or duusare paper main kramshah 140 or 132 number mili, jinhen scalling ke baad 187
 47 and 158
 32 aanka gaya
 The other student's 140 and 120 numbers were 136 respectively
 82 or 118
 11 counted
 in donon maamalon main bhi sanyog se scalling main zyada number paane vaale chaatr yadav hai
 This analysis of the final result of the PCS examination once again makes the role of Commission Chairman Anil Kumar Yadav questionable
 haalanki yadav kaa is bare main kahana he ki ayog ke adhyaksh kaa pad sanvaidhanik he or ‘‘mujhe nyaayadhishon kii tarah pratikriya dena anivaary nahin he
 "but they do not forget to add the word that the matter is under consideration in the court
" ’’ is masale par baatcheet ayog ke sachiv karte hai or unka bhi naam sanyog se anil kumaar yadav he
 But despite this denial, this analysis of the PCS exam is going to give a new headache to the SP government, which is already surrounded by allegations of preserving caste-specific and defeated in the Lok Sabha elections 2014
 ayog ke kai pariksha parinaamon ko elahabaad hycourt main chunauti dene vaale vakil santosh shrivastav kii baat par gaur karen, ‘‘sabase pehla sawaal yah uth rahaa he ki uttar pradesh main obisi main koi 234 jatiyaan shaamil hai
 In such a situation, if only one caste of people will take 58% quota of OBC and the remaining 230 castes will be reduced to just 42% share, then what will be the meaning of the basic spirit of reservation
 koi kitna bhi medhaavi kyon na ho, lekin ye nattejey jati vishesh kii ore nateezon kaa jhukaav dikhaa rahe hai
 "on the other hand, Avnish Kumar Pandey, who has filed a PIL against the PCS-2011 result under the banner of" Competitive Student Conflict Committee ", directly questions the functioning of the Commission," Boys and Girls in Allahabad 10-10 " For years, they keep preparing in the hope that one day their hard work will bring color
 lekin ayog jis tarah se har pariksha parinaam main ekatarfa ravaiya apana rahaa he, usase chaatro kaa dil tut rahaa he or dimag gusse se ubal rahaa he
 For the competitive examinations, the talk of Avneesh, author of the book "brahmi", "general Hindi", cannot be dismissed outright
 sapa ke ek varisht rajyasabha saansad ke kareebi maane jane vaale yadav ke lok seva ayog kaa adhyaksh banane ke baad aae kuch anya pariksha nateezon par gaur karen to bhi ‘‘yadavvaad’’ ke aarope ko bal miltaa he

 After doing this, the courage of this very backward class boy who has entered the world of competition further increases the crisis of the credit of the Commission

 "whether the results have been biased or the candidates of the Yadav society have indeed become extremely meritorious, it can tell the conscience of the courts or the commissioners
 lekin mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke liye aise parinaam shubh siyaasi sanket to jarur hi nahin laaenge
 What the Chairman says, UP Public Service Commission Chairman Anil Kumar Yadav says, "the post of the Chairman of the Commission is a constitutional post and i am not obliged to give any response

 unka kahana he ki pradesh main agar maance kii killat hui to vah dilli se matan mangavaayenge
 On the other hand, UP government spokesperson Siddharth Nath Singh told the news agency ANI that this action is only on illegal slaughterhouses

 Now all these establishments have reached the verge of closure due to the strike of mutton and chicken sellers
 kuraishi ne kaha ki boojadkhaanon par karrwai ke kaaran lakhon logon kii rojiroti par sankat paidaa ho gaya he
 However, Shamil Shamsi, who runs a non-vegetarian hotel in the city, welcomed the closure of illegal slaughterhouses in the state, saying that if there was a shortage of meat in the state, we would bring mutton from Delhi and the quality of food would not be compromised
 unhone yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki avaidh boojadkhaanon main kutton tak ko kaata ja rahaa he
 Shamsi said on a question that it is not a matter related to religion, but is directly related to the health of the people

 At the same time, in Adityanath Yogi's own Gorakhpur area, the people working in slaughterhouses are worried

 Minister of State for External Affairs Shashi Tharoor, while airing another possible controversy, questioned the tightening of Indian visa rules in the backdrop of the David Headley case and said, "26 / 11 killers did not have visas"
 Tharoor gave this statement on Twitter in his comment '26 / 11 killers did not have visas'
 tharur ne is baat par aashcharya vyakt kiya he ki kya vija niyamon main sakhti kaa koi matlab he or kya yah vastav main ‘suraksha’ ke bachaav ke liye he
 Tharoor has asked whether India is going to call terrorists this country as 'less welcoming'

 Tharoor wrote in his remarks on Saturday, "is all this being done only in the hope that we can prevent Headley from taking reconnaissance in future
 kya ham aatankwaadiyon kaa kam swaagat karne vaala desh banane ja rahe hai

 We have a conversation with co-founder Brian Acton
 philhal acton signal foundation ke chairman or siio hai
 Till date, he has said to Tech that whatsapp is no longer what he created
 bryan acton or jine ne whatsapp ko fasebuk ke haathon 2014 main bech diya
 Facebook acquired it on 14 February 2014 and the company spent 19 billion dollars for it
 ye donon founders bhi fasebuk kaa hissaa ban gaye or watsap head karte rahe
 However, in 2017, Brian left whatsapp
 philhal bryan signal foundation ke chairman or siio hai jisaki shuruyaat unhone 2018 main kii thi
 Prior to this, Brian has also worked in Yahoo and Apple
 signal foundation data security par kaam karata he
 Brian Acton has said in a conversation with Tech till date, 'I think whatsapp has lost its identity, because now both the founders of whatsapp have left the company
 ’fasebuk ke haathon watsap bechney ke sawaal par bryan kai baar public main bol chuke hai or unhone ye bhi kaha he ki tab thodi experience kii kami thi
 Bryan is against Facebook's policy and has recently asked people to delete Facebook
 unhen watsap kaa nayaa model pasand nahin or unka maananaa he ki vigyaapan or data share karke fasebuk ne watsap ko khokhla kar diya he
 Recently, Mark Zuckerberg has announced that merging whatsapp, Messenger and Instagram will feature cross platform messaging
 hamane bryan se is bare main bhi poocha to unka kahana he ki iskaa safal hona kaaphi mushkil he
 Brian Acton has told Tech till date, 'now Facebook is trying to merge the product experience
 yah kaaphi mushkil kaam he or iskaa safal hona bhi aasaan nahin he’bryan pehle se hi watsap ko ped bananaa chaahate the, taaki yugers ke data ke saath samjhauta na karnaa pade
 But this could not happen due to Facebook
 fasebuk or watsap ke donon founders ke bich anban hoti rahi, kyonki fasebuk ne adhigrahan ke samay kaha tha ki watsap ko sepperate rakhaa jayega
 But later the founders of whatsapp felt that Facebook was interfering in the work of whatsapp
 gauratlab he ki bryan acton or jine kum Yahoo main kaam karte the
 He left Yahoo in 2007 and briefly took a break from work
 kuch samay baad in donon ne fasebuk main job ke liye aavedan kiya, lekin unhen riject kar diya gaya
 In 2009, the two together built whatsapp and in 2014 Facebook bought whatsapp for $ 19 billion (about Rs
 13 trillion)

 Home remedies to remove blackness of underarm: 1
 shev karne se behatar he ki aap anderarms ke anachaahe baalo ko hataane ke liye vexing hi karen
 This removes hair from inside and also removes dead cells, which makes the skin clear

 ise pratidin 15 se 20 minute tak anderarms main lagane se kaaphi phayda hoga
 3
 aalu ek natural bleech he
 If you wish, before taking a bath every day, cut a few pieces of potato and rub it in the underarm
 aisa karne se kaalaapan kam hoga

 If possible, use it sparingly and use other home remedies to remove the smell of underarm

 kaise paidaa hote hai soshal media ke trols? farhaan akhtar ne sunai kahanefarhan akhtar ne twit kiya-'to, asaram ab ek child repist he
 And he is found guilty
 acha he
 But can people stop sharing his pictures with PM Modi? kisi aise vyakti ke saath khadey hona yaa uskaa sangrakshan karnaa wo bhi us samay jab uske aparaadhon se pardaa naa uthaa ho, koi krime nahin he
 Let us be fair and understand that he too did not know his truth like us
 'so, Asaram is a child rapist
 And he has been found guilty
 Good
 But can people please stop sharing images of him with PM Modi
 Patronising him before he was exposed to be a pervert is no crime
 Let's be fair and give him the benefit of doubt that he, like us, did not know

 com / zbsb9lk1zm — Dhruv Rathee (@dhruv_rathee) April 25, 2018 alok raihamaara rajnatik jivan jodtod or chal-prapanchon main maharath kii aisi khan ban gaya he ki yah samajhnaa mushkil he ki hindi ke rashtriya bhashaa hone, yaa banane, ko lekar amit shah ke aakasmik visphot kaa kya arth lagaaya jaae
 After all, it can also be an attempt to whip up the news in its own way and divert attention from the constant bad news
 tamilnadu or dakshin kii taraf kuchhek hindi-virdohi pradarshan hue nahin ki ghati kaa sankat logon kii yaadon main dhundhala pad jayega or usamen tirohit ho jayega, jise ve 'saamaanya halaat' kahkar khush hote hai —jiske myne hai chaaron taraf contile taar kii barbandi or viraan sadakon par gasht lagaate akraspa (sashastr bal vishesh adhikaar kanoon) se mahfuj bandookdhaari sainik
 There is no hope of ending the economic crisis too soon - it is not ordinary mathematics, but Piyush Goyal's "quantum Economics" may work, that too with a little help of Hindi
 yaa yah bhi ho saktaa he ki amit shah mahaj hawa kaa rukh bhaanpane ke liye patang uda rahe hon, logon kii sambhavit pratikriya jaanane kii garaj se
 In such a situation, the wise response would be to ignore this provocation and wait for the ignorance, which has been promised, to become the real policy
 lekin—or thik yaheen kathputliyaan nachaane vaala kathputliyon par apane niyantran kaa pradarshan karata he—kuch fouran cheekhney-chillane or uchhal-kud karne lage
 In my opinion, sad silence is better than this spectacle of protest
 aakhikar ham hindi ko baraabar waalon main pratham banane ke, ek str par hanirahit, is suzav se zyada bade gusse kaa izhaar dekh chuke hai
 Except, of course, this ostentatious innocence can be a crooked maneuver in itself, a smile before the last fatal blow
 is rajnatik khel ke duusare kai khiladinnon ke ulat, sanghiyon kii ek asal vichaardhaara he—or hakeekat yah bhi he ki bhagava fujen apane jahrile lakshyon kii khoj main athak juty rahati hai
 At this stage, Hindi — a particular type of Hindi — is a big part of their core agenda
 is mukaam par yah tark mere liye khaas taur par mushkil ho jaataa he—kyonki aakhirkaar main khud ko hindi vaale ke taur par hi dekhtaa hum, jo maanata he ki hindi main khaskar hindi pradeshon kii loktantric urja ko lamaband karne kii akut kshamta he, jo aaj apane ko itane vikrut, jahrile roopon main vyakt kar rahe hai
 It is the Hindi that has developed as a medium of communication between people living a shared life practically throughout the great expanse of this great country during the millennium
 yah vah bhashaa he jisamen sthaneey or kshetreey boliyon ke anant rup samahit hai, jo sabhi milakar nirantar sanchaar ke liye paryaapt hai or jisaki logon ko sabase zyada jarurat he
 This Hindi has become practically 'national' largely due to the cinema of Bombay
 beshak, is hindi par kaam karne—bahut sara kaam karne—kii jarurat he taaki yah ucchtar darje kii panjikaon kaa nirmaan kar sake, gyaan kii vaahak or bhandar ban sake
 And the Sanghis could remain unaffected by the tongues of regular springs from the tongues of ministers
 magar is sachmuch mushkil kaam main us ek or shuddhtavaadi 'hindi' kii dakhal se koi madad nahin milti, jo 20veen sadi kii shuruyaat main ubhari thi
 It was the bearer of the ever-increasing grandiose ambitions of the upper caste Hindus of the heartland, who came a long way from securing lower rung jobs in the colonial administration to displacing the English of the colonists as the national language of independent India
 She went
 samvidhan sabha ne is pravriti ko lekar uchit hi aagaah kiya tha or us vakt bhi ise 'hindi samrajyavad' mana tha
 This 'hindi' is fundamentally different from the Hindi of the Qaumi or the public
 yahi vah 'hindi' he jise main 'gurugram' or 'prayagraj' se jodta hum, jo tatsam kii abhilaashaa se badsoorat ho chuki he
 With that desire, which wants to reverse the order of time and history and wants us to return the language, etc
, to that brahminical-arya, certainly Sanskritist, mythical state of purity, which is merely the 'identity' of being To be liberated, to be restored to pure and unified 'identity' state
 jaise, ek raashtra, ek samskruti, ek bhashaa
 
 
 And — why not? —A party democracy too
 yah khatarnaak bakawaas he or ise khulkar kaha janaa chahie
 We are a multi-cultural, multi-linguistic, multi-religious country - a celebration of diversity, like Mahaparva
 hamaare rajyatantr kaa dhilaa-dhaala, sangheey swaroop sanvaidhanik budhimata he, kamajori kii nishaani nahin
 As our Constitution-makers had envisaged, this structure will remain intact if we hold it lightly
 lekin bahut zyada bahusankhyak dabaav daalaa—jaisi bhi, jahaan bhi katarbyont ke saath—to paaramparik, anuvanshik, aitihaasik daraaren khulne lagengi, tuutane lagengi
 Structures break under pressure
 yah bataanaa sidhaa-sada bhautikashastra he, rajdroh nahin

 bataaya ja rahaa he ki chota rajan ne poochtacha main kai raaj ugale hai
 From Dawood Ibrahim to the d-company operatives in the Maharashtra Police
 lekin khufia agenciyon ke ek dhade kaa maananaa he ki chota rajan jo baaten bataa rahaa he, un par bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 There are 5 major reasons for this: -1
 chota rajan khud kai saal se daaud ke sampark main nahin he, isliye uski di hui suchanaaen bahut zyada bharosemand nahin hongi
 2
 khud ek khufia adhikari ne mail today se kaha he ki vah 27 saal se baahar he
 What useful information can he give them? 3
 At one time Indian agencies used the Chhota Rajan gang against the d-company, but that phase has passed

 In the initial interrogation, Rajan could not give any information about Dawood, on which the intelligence agencies could get excited
 5
 Rajan may be Dawood's enemy, but he has also been his companion once upon a time
 agenciyaan uske har daawey ko jaanch-parakh rahi hai
 According to the sources, the CBI will also give many information related to Chhota Rajan Nedoud, but at the moment they are not being taken very seriously

 maharashtra main shivasena ne kiya sarkaar banane kaa daawaayensipi boli- shivasena kaa siem hona mumkinmaharashtra main shivasena ne sarkaar banane kaa daawa kiya
 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that we have a majority figure
 abhi hamaare paas 170 vidhayakon kaa samarthan he, jo 175 tak pahunch saktaa he
 Let me tell you, Shiv Sena has 56 mlas, while Congress has 44 and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has 54 mlas, while the number of Independents is more than a dozen
 agar ye sabhi partiyaan ekasaath aati hai to ye aankada 170 ke kareeb pahunchataa he
 At the same time, party leaders are meeting at NCP headquarters in Mumbai
 ye baithak somvaar ko party pramukh sharad pavaar or congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke bich honi vaali mulaakaat se pehle ho rahi he
 Meanwhile, NCP spokesman Nawab Malik has also given a big statement
 unhone kaha ki agar shivasena kahati he ki unka mukhyamantri banegaa to yah bilkul mumkin he
 Shiv Sena should make its role very clear
 ham bhi apni bhoomika bataa denge
 He said that at present the people have chosen us to sit in the opposition and we are ready for that
 shivasena ne kiya bijepi par hamalisse pehle saamana main shivasena ne ek baar phir se bijepi par nishaanaa saadhaa
 The Shiv Sena made serious allegations against the BJP in its mouthpiece Saamana over the continuing plight of the CM post in the formation of the new coalition government
 shivasena ne likhaa ki bijepi ko idi, police, paisa, dhak ke dam par anya partiyon ke vidhayak todakar sarkaar banani padegi
 If there is a majority without Kishiv Sena written in Saamna then form a government, become the Chief Minister
 yah sidhaa sandesh uddhav thakare ne diya
 There is no opposition or Chief Ministerial candidate in the party today for Devendra Fadnavis
 yah ek ajeebogareeb sanyog he
 If Gopinath Munde had been there today, the scene of Maharashtra would have looked different and Munde would have become the Chief Minister, then in the Yuti, the acrimony would not have been seen today
 bijepi kii kya ranneetimaharashtra main bijepi kii nai ranneeti saamne ai he
 BJP will wait for Shiv Sena for talks
 party ko ummid he ki 4 or 5 november ke baad shivasena phir se baatcheet shuru karegi, kyonki tab tak congress or ensipi bhi apana rukh saaf kar chuki hongi
 This is the math of the seats in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly of 288 seats, needing 145 seats for the majority
 shivasena ke 56 or ensipi 54 vidhayak hai
 That means there are only 110 mlas, which is 35 less than the magic number of the majority
 aise main unhen congress ke 44 vidhayakon ke samarthan kii zarurat hogi
 The Congress has not opened the cards at the moment but Maharashtra Congress leaders say that the party should support the Shiv Sena to form the government
 aise main agar congress bhi samarthan karti he to ye aankada 154 tak pahunch jayega
 At the same time, 6 independent mlas have also supported Shiv Sena

 The AG assured that no one will be denied the benefit of these schemes
 ASG tushaar mehta ne kaha ki sirf chaar fisadi logon ke paas aadhaar nahin he
 During the hearing itself, Justice DY Chandrachud, a member of the Bench, said that the Center should ensure that no one is deprived of this benefit for not providing Aadhaar
 iske liye rashan card yaa voter ycard liya janaa chahie
 Justice AK Sikri said that most of the poor people do not know that they can give alternative identity documents too
 aise main sarkaar aise kadam uthaae jisase logon ko jaagruk kiya ja sake ki wo pahchaan ke duusare dastavej laga sakate hai
 Now the matter will be heard again before February 13 in front of the Constitution Bench

 On April 21, the entire nation celebrated Akshaya Tritiya
 hinduon main is din ko sona kharidne ke liye shubh mana jaataa he
 But this is not the only day to buy gold
 dhanteras, diwaali or zyaadaatar duusare tyoharon se pehle sona khareednaa mangalakaari samajha jaataa he
 This is the reason why Hindustani is the largest buyer of gold worldwide
 bharat ne 2014-15 main kareeb 850 ton sona aayaat kiya
 Officials also estimate that around 175 tonnes of gold were smuggled into the country
 akele march, 2015 main hi 121 ton sone kaa aayaat kiya gaya, jo march, 2014 ke mukaable 48
 5 tons more
 itani baari-bharkam maatra ke baavjood world gold council ke mutabik, bharat ke sarkari khajaane main sirf 557
 There is 7 tons of gold
 sone ke sarkari bhandar ke maamle main bharat 11wein sthaan par he, jabaki america ke paas 8,133
 There is a stock of 5 tonnes of gold and is the first in the world
 to phir aayaat kiya gaya saikadon ton sona aakhir jaataa kahaan he? mukhya rup se nijee lokaron main
 About 22,000 tonnes of gold and gold jewelery are with private individuals, families, temples and trusts
 sone kaa yah bhandar shaayad duniya main sabase bada he
 a large part of this huge stock is stored with temple trusts in the form of jewelery, coins and gold biscuits of the gods, which is estimated to be more than 3,000 tonnes
 haalanki kisi bhi mandir kaa prabandhan sone ke is bhandar ke bare main sahi-sahi aankada bataane ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 Economists consider this gold reserves to be dormant or futile, which have no contribution or use in our economy
 anaavashyak aayaat ke taur par 2012-13 main bharat ke chaalu vittiya ghate yaa aayaat-niryaat asantulan main sone kaa hissaa 28 fisadi tha
 The Narendra Modi government wants to take advantage of this reserves of gold and convert it into active capital
 may main shuruyaat karte hue sarkaar in bhandaron ko nivesh kaa vikalp banaakar inhen mudra main badalane kii yojana bana rahi he
 These investment options are: to earn interest by depositing gold in banks and gold bonds, which can be sold later
 sarkaar ke kabje main aane ke baad niskriy padi yah puunji sone ke aayaat kharch ko kam kar sakati he or is tarah vittiya ghate ko bhi kam karne main madadgaar ho sakati he
 But no one is ready to agree to this plan
 mandiron ke treston kaa kahana he ki unki tijoriyon main padaa sona bhakton kaa sadiyon se chadhaaya jaataa rahaa chadhaava he
 Take, for example, the safes of the Sripadmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram
 mana jaataa he ki yahaan sone kaa athaah bhandar he, jiskaa mulya hinduon ke sabase amir maane jane vaale, andhra pradesh main thirumala sthit shri venkatesh mandir se bhi zyada he
 The Sri Krishna temple at Guruvayur and the Lord Ayyappa temple at Sabarimala (both in Kerala) are believed to have thousands of crores of rupees
 mulya vaale sone kaa khajaana he
 But the Travancore, Cochin and Malabar Devaswom boards are against the scheme
 ye board kerala main 3,890 mandiron kii dekharekh karte hai
 They fear that the banks will turn them into gold ingots or strips, causing them to lose their value
 darasal, travnakor devswam board ke ek sutara kaa kahana he ki bharat-china yuddh ke dauraan unhone jo aabhushan daan main die the, unhen sone kii silliyon main badalakar lautaa diya gaya tha
 Due to lack of skilled craftsmen, they could not be converted into jewelery again
 kuch mandiron ke trust bhagwaan ko chadaaye gaye sone par byaaj kamaane kaa virodh karte hai
 Kerala Chief Minister Uquaman Chandy, who is a Christian himself, is also against currency gold
 ve kah chuke hai, ''ham bhannton or mandiron kii sahmati ke bagaiyr centre sarkaar ko shri padmanabhaswami mandir yaa kisi bhi anya puja sthal ke bahumoolya aabhushanon ko haath lagane kii ijaajat nahin denge
 "the only exception to this case is the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD), which oversees the management of the Sri Venkateswara Temple in Andhra Pradesh
 kendriya bainkon se itar ise duniya main sone ke sabase bade bhandar kaa maalik mana jaataa he
 In recent years, TTD has started sending mint to Mumbai to convert gold jewelery into 22 carat coins
 in cinnkon ko puri duniya main bhakton ko bech diya jaataa he
 Gold jewelery offered to God has been given to banks
 inhen taksaal main galaakar or 0
 Pure to 995 grades are lent to jewelers in the form of gold biscuits and earn interest from them
 jamaa kii avadhi khatm ho jane ke baad unhen sone ke rup main hi waapas kiya jaataa he, na ki nagdi ke rup main
 Anandji Kalyanji Trust has also given its reserves of gold to banks at nominal interest
 yah trust gujarat ke bhavnagar jile main 1,300 jain mandiron ke prabandhan kaa kaam dekhtaa he
 Other such trusts such as Sri Arasuri Ambaji Mata Devasthan Trust, which oversees the famous Ambaji temple, and the Sri Dwarkadhish Temple Devasthan Committee in Jamnagar have shown interest in this scheme of depositing gold
 is bich mumbai ke siddhivinayak mandir ke prabandhakon ne sirf ek aapatti ke saath is vichaar kaa swaagat kiya he
 Narendra Murari Rane, president of this temple trust, says, "if this scheme will be beneficial, safe and good-paying, then we will deposit our gold in nationalized banks
" "darasal bekaar pade sone kii tijoriyon kaa munh kholane main byaaj dar mahatvapurn sabit ho sakati he
 Rajendra Jadhav, executive officer of Sri Sai Baba Institute in Shirdi, says, "banks will have to pay far more than the nominal interest rate of one percent
 "lekin bahut-se bhannt iske khilaaf hai
 Says a gold merchant in Mumbai, "earning a temple interest on gold offered to God is a sin
" " unka parivaar pichley kai varshon main 200 kilo sona mandiron ko daan kar chukaa he
 An arrangement has been made for 29 government-controlled temples in Himachal, which are managed by the trusts under the Himachal Pradesh Hindu Public Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments Act, 1948
 is vyavastha ke jariye daan main die gaye kul sone kaa 10 fisadi hissaa mandir ke vikaas main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he or 20 fisadi hissaa bhartiya state bank ke sona jamaa yojana main nivesh kiya ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, these temples can retain a further 20 per cent share
 baaki ke 50 fisadi hisse kaa metels and minerals trading korporation kii madad se shuddhikaran karwaakar nishaani ke taur par inhen sikkon or smaranchinhon ke rup main badla ja saktaa he
 Financial analysts say that all the gold received as donations should be converted into gold bricks, sticks or coins and auctioned every month
 isse jo paisa praapt ho, use sambandhit dharmik treston ke bank khaaton main jamaa kar dena chahie
 But to start this new gold economy, there needs to be a change in faith first

 a senior official said the move meant a lot as the government decided to go ahead with the formation of the search committee while Congress leader in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Khage boycotted the meetings of the Lokpal selection committee headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 Have done unhone kaha ki lokapal ke gathan kii disha main khoj samiti ek bada kadam he
 The committee will start its functioning soon
 lokapal evam lokayukta adhinium ko 2013 main paarit kiye jane ke chaar saal baad khoj samiti kaa gathan karne kaa faisla kiya gaya he
 Kharge had been boycotting the selection committee meetings on the grounds that he was not made a full-time member of the committee
 unhone chayan samiti kii baithkon main shaamil hone ke liye ‘vishesh aamantrit’ ke taur par is saal chah maukon (ek march, 10 april, 19 july, 21 agast, chaar sitambar or 19 sitambar) par nyaute ko khaarij kar diya
 Significantly, Kharge requested the government to amend the Lokpal Act so that the leader of the largest opposition party in the Lok Sabha can be included in the selection committee and an ordinance should be brought in this regard
 darasal, lokapal adhinium ke mutabik loksabhaa main vipaksh ke netaa hi chayan samiti ke sadsy ho sakate hai jabaki khadge ko yah darja hasil nahin he, isliye vah samiti kaa hissaa nahin hai
 The Lokpal selection committee is headed by the Prime Minister

 Shah has estimated the scam to be worth Rs 35,000 crore
 parrikar ne kaha ki 50 se 100 karod rupee kii raashi rajasav nuksaan ke ek pahalu tak simit he, jo khanan kshetra kii avaidh gatividhiyon kii vajah se hui he
 He said that this does not mean that the loss of mining is just Rs 100 crore

 Parrikar, while speaking during the Question Hour in the Legislative Assembly, clarified his statement during a press conference, saying the loss is due to the heap of mining, the difference between the ore extracted and exported during that time
 unhone kaha, piesi (lok lekha samiti) kii 3,500 se 4,000 karod rupee ke sarkaar ko nuksaan kii report sahi he, or iske anusaar unhone (chartered accountents kii samiti) 1,500 se 2000 karod rupee ke nuksaan kaa anumaan kiya he

 The Shah Commission's estimate of Goa mining scam to be Rs 35,000 crore was incorrect
 unhone daawa kiya ki ayog dwaara surveykshan kar jutaya gaya aankada galat he
 "the Shah Commission report is based on a survey conducted by hand-held gadgets," Parrikar said in response to the question of former Chief Minister and Congress MLA Lujinho Fleario during the Question Hour in the Assembly

 Parrikar also has a mining department
 unhone kaha ki ayog kaa anumaan he ki patte kii simaaen khanan companiyon dwaara badal di gayi or atirikt 580 hectare jameen unke dwaara le lee gai
 He said that a detailed survey conducted by the state government revealed that only 10 hectares of land was occupied by mining companies
 parrikar ne kaha, shah ayog kaa surveykshan galat he
 He said that the total price of the extracted ore does not show the government's loss, thus reducing the estimated loss by the commission
 unhone kaha ki goa ke sakal gharelu utpaada (jidipi) main khanan kshetra dwaara arjeet rajasav kaa ghatak 2012 kii tulana main 2018 main sirf paanch fisadi tha
 The mining in Goa has been banned by the Supreme Court in 2012 along with the state and central governments

 england menkhufia agencikejibi ke ek purv jasoos ko jehar dene ko lekar rus or britain ke bich tanatani badhati ja rahi he
 Britain's Foreign Minister Boris Johnson has accused Russia of poisoning former double agent Sergey Skripal
 unhone is hamale ko rus ke badale kii aanch bataaya he
 According to Boris, poisoning the agent is a sign from President Putin that no one can escape the heat of Russia's revenge
 bataa den, rus ne purv dabl agent sargei scripal ab bhi coma main hai
 His daughter is also hospitalized
 ve salisburi shahar main ek bench par achetavastha main paae gaye the
 Johnson told the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs that Russia wanted to tell the parishioners what would happen to them if they supported any other country
 unhone yah bhi daawa kiya ki unhone britain ko hamale ke liye chunaa kyonki usne rus ke anuchit bartaav kii baar-baar aalochana kii he
 Significantly, the poisoning of former double agent Sergei Skripal has caused tension in the relations between Britain and Russia
 aaropon ko putin kar chuke hai khaarijputin ne britain or uske sahyogi deshon ke in aaropon ko pehle hi betuka bataate hue khaarij kar diya tha ki chaar march ko scripal (66) or unki beti ulia (33) par britain ke salisburi main hue chemical atake ke peeche rus kaa haath he
 Both are currently in hospital and their condition remains critical
 britain ne kaha he ki soviet dwaara dizin kiye gayi sainya shrenee ke nerve agent novichok kaa istemaal scripal ke khilaaf kiya gaya
 Britain had given citizenship that Russian retired military intelligence officer Skripal was sentenced to 13 years in 2006 on charges of spying for Britain
 haalanki, baad main unhen maafee mil gai thi or britain ne unhen naagarikta de di thi
 He has been living in the UK since then
 chemical atake ke liye rus ko gheraapichley hafte hi britain, france, germany or america ne ek sanyukt bayaan jari kar dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad se pehali baar rasinic hathiyaaron kaa aakraamak istemaal karne ke liye rus ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha
 UK banks, energy and water companies are on high alert in view of possible Russian cyber attack threat amid deepening diplomatic tension between the two countries (russia and UK) over a case of a cyber attack poisoning the former Russian spy in Britain is kept
 23 rajanyikon ko kar chuke hai nishkasitaisase pehlerusane bich shanivaar ko britain ke 23 rajanyikon ko nishkasit karne kaa elaan kar diya tha

 rus ne yah kadam britain dwaara rus ke 23 rajanyikon ko nishkasit karne ke faisle ke baad uthaaya he
 The Union Home Ministry has said that 40,000 Rohingyas living illegally will be evicted from the country
 rohingya musalmaan desh main alag-alag jagahon par rah rahe hai or ab samasya banate ja rahe hai
 Sources reveal that the Rohingya, who came illegally from Myanmar to India in the coming years, will be gradually sent back as part of the ongoing process
 jaankaree ke mutabik zyaadaatar rohingya musalmaan is vakt jammu kashmir, hyderabad, haryana, uttar pradesh, dilli-ensiaar or rajasthan main rahete hai
 According to the data available with the Ministry of Home Affairs, UNHCR currently has information about more than 14,000 Rohingya living in India
 haalanki jo duusari suchanaaen grih mantralay ke paas maujuud hai, unke mutabik lagbhag 40 hajaar rohingya avaidh rup se bharat main rah rahe hai
 Explain to you that the detection and repatriation of illegal foreign nationals is a continuous process, the Central Government i
e
 the Ministry of Home Affairs has been given the rights under Section 3 (2) of the Foreigners Act 1946 to locate and repatriate illegal foreign nationals
 Is initiating the process of sending them on the basis of
 rajya sarkaron or vahaan ke prashasan ko bhi rohingya sahit avaidh rup se rah rahe videshi nagarikon kii pahchaan karne unhen rokane or unhen vah waapas bhejne kii shaktiyaan di gai hai
 The largest number of Rohingya Muslims in India are settled in Jammu
 vahaan kareeb 10,000 ronhigya muslim rahete hai
 What is the matter? Actually, the Myanmar government enacted a nationality law in 1982 that ended the civil status of Rohingya Muslims
 jiske baad se hi myanmar sarkaar rohingya musalamaanon ko desh chhodane ke liye majaboor karti aa rahi he
 Although the root of this whole dispute is about 100 years old, in 2012, the communal riots in Rakhine State of Myanmar served to fuel it
 uttari rakhin main rohingya musalamaanon or buddha dharm ke logon ke bich hue is dange main 50 se zyada muslim or kareeb 30 buddha log maare gaye the
 In this sequence, many Rohingya Muslims had also entered India and now the central government is in the mood to take action on them
 kya he vivadarohingya musalmaan or myanmar ke bahusankhyakbuddha samudaay kebich vivaad 1948 main myanmar ke aaazaad hone ke baad se hi chalaa aa rahaa he
 It is said that in Rakhine state, also known as Arakan, Muslims have lived since the 16th century
 ye wo daur tha jab myanmar main british shashan tha
 When the first anglo-burma War ended in 1826, the British rule over Arakan was established
 is dauraan britash shaskaon ne bangladesh se mazdooron ko arakaan laana shuru kiya
 In this way, the number of visitors from neighboring country Bangladesh in Rakhine of Myanmar increased steadily
 bangladesh se jaakar rakhin main based ye vahi log the jinhen aaj rohingya musalamaanon ke taur par janaa jaataa he
 Seeing the number of Rohingya rising, Myanmar's General Ne Win's government enacted Burma's national law in 1982
 is kanoon ke tahat rohangya musalamaanon kii naagarikta khatm kar di gai

 unke namakan ke virodh main kisi bhi congress netaa ne ummidawari kaa daawa nahin kiya he
 Accusations of familism are following Rahul Gandhi
 sonia gandhi kaa bhi peechha kar rahaa tha, rajeev gandhi or indira gandhi kaa bhi peechha karata rahaa he
 Jitendra Prasad filed his nomination after 1998 when Sonia Gandhi was about to become president in 2001
 or unke saath kai congress netaa bhi khadey hue
 Jitendra Prasad lost but Sonia Gandhi faced the election for the first time
 2001 se 2017 tak sonia gandhi ke khilaaf koi chunaav nahin hua
 In 2017, Rahul Gandhi has not faced any election, no one has been fielded against him, son is being made president after mother
 nehru gandhi parivaarwaad kii baat hoti he lekin yah rajeev gandhi ke baad se zyada spasht hoti he
 We have to differentiate between the families that jumped in today and the time of the freedom struggle, but with the difference that they jump for the freedom of the country in the fight, they are becoming president or ministers to maintain their hold on power
 jawahar laal nehru ko mahatma gandhi ne pradhanmantri banaaya tha
 Nehru spent 9 years in prison during the freedom struggle
 nehru kii patni kamala nehru khud swatantraaa senaanee thim
 Nehru's father Motilal Nehru was also a hero of independence
 nehru kii bahan vijay lakshmi pandit swatantraaa senaanee thim
 It was in Nehru's life that Indira Gandhi became Congress President in 1959
 1960 main neelam sanjeev reddy adhyaksh ban gaye the
 In 1969, taking on the syndicate, Indira Gandhi formed her own party
 indira gandhi ko zyaada sabit karnaa padaa raajnneeti main
 Congress was formed
 haari or jitati raheen wo alag kahani he
 In Indira Gandhi's time, the foundation of familism was laid
 rajeev gandhi pradhanmantri bane magar sonia gandhi adhyaksh pad par hi raheen, manmohan singh pradhanmantri bane
 The BJP continues to allege that power is with Sonia, Manmohan is a puppet
 iske baad bhi manmohan singh ke pradhanmantri rahete congress ne 2009 main chunaav jeeta tha
 Sonia Gandhi was the president but the election was for Manmohan Singh
 manmohan singh 2014 main haar gaye
 Sardar Patel's family has also been in politics
 vitthal bhai patel sardaar vallabh bhai patel ke sage bade bhai the
 He formed the Swaraj Party with CR Das, Motilal Nehru
 vitthal bhai patel 1925 main central legislative asambeli ke adhyaksh or spikar the
 His younger brother Sardar Ballabh Bhai Patel became the Home Minister
 patel kii pahchaan vitthal bhai ke chote bhai se nahin, bardoli ke kisaan andolan se thi
 After the death of Sardar Patel, Nehru gave his daughter Maniben a Lok Sabha ticket in 1952
 vivaad hone par nehru ne kaha ki ve beti hai magar 1930 se azaadi kii ladaai main shaamil hai
 Patel's daughter Maniben Patel and son Dayabhai Patel both contested the Lok Sabha elections in 1957
 baad main maniben patel rajya sabha kii sadsy bhi huin magar iske baad patel parivaar sunai nahin diya
 Today, the Patel family has no claim on that legacy
 unki koi party nahin he
 Lal Bahadur Shastri's family also came into politics but the sons of that honest and simple leader did not get any special political benefit
 jabaki ek congress main rahe or duusare bijepi main
 Biju Patnaik's son Naveen Patnaik is also an example
 bharat kii raajnneeti main pariwaron ke daayre se baahar ek se ek netaa bhi paidaa hue jinhone raajnneeti badal di magar unki banaai party bhi parivaarwaad kii god main chali gai
 Rahul Gandhi has been hesitant about this familyism for a long time, but now it seems that he has overcome this criticism, but this question will continue to follow him
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke samay rahul gandhi ne times nau ko die intervyuu main kaha tha ki 'main apane parivaar kaa baar baar naam nahin letaa hum, ek yaa do baar hi liya hoga asli, mudda yah he ki is parivaar main main paidaa hua yah meraa chayan nahin tha
 i did not sign that i would like to be born into this family
 main vanshavaad kii avadharana ke khilaaf hum
 ' rahul se bhi poocha janaa chahie or yahi sawaal uddhav thakare, aditya thakare, prakaash singh badal, sukhbir badal, mahabuuba mufti, faruq abdulla, omar abdulla, mulaayam singh yadav, akhilesh yadav, lalu yadav, tejasvi yadav, karunanidhi, stallin, ramvilas paswan, chiraag paswan se bhi poocha janaa chahie
 Nobody answers
 kya bijepi main koi aisa niyam he ki jinke pita mukhyamantri, mantri yaa saansad rahe hai ve kabhi party adhyaksh yaa pradhanmantri nahin banenge, kya bijepi ne aisa kaha he
 Is there more internal democracy in the parties where the president does not become a family, the answer is no
 kya vahaan adhyaksh pad kaa loktantric bhaavana ke anuroop nirvachan hota he, jawaab he nahin
 i spoke to Professor Ashutosh of Punjab University on this subject in a prime time of 2014 when he said that the Congress and the Akali, even though separate parties in Punjab, used to marry like Rajput kings to expand their power
 But their big leaders are in-law, daughter-in-law, son, son-in-law, daughter-in-law and brother-in-law
 ashutosh ne punjab uniwarsity kii chaatra gunarit cor ke eme main likhe parche kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki prakaash singh badal ke cabinet mantri aadesh pratap singh unke damaad hai
 Adesh is the son of Pratap Singh Kairon, a Congress chief minister in Punjab for ten years
 captain amarinder singh kii patni, simranjit singh maan kii patni or beant singh ke baad congress ke mukhyamantri haracharan singh baraar kii bahu aapas main bahanen hai
 Similarly, the Majithia family was considered a Congressman but Surjit Singh Majithia's son Vikram Singh Majithia is now in Akali
 unki bahan kii shaadi dipti siem sukhbir singh badal se hui he
 Vikram himself is also an MLA and cabinet minister from Akali
 bhartiya raajnneeti main parivaarwaad ko lekar patric french ne ek gambhir adhyayan kiya he
 Patrick studied the family background of 545 mps of the 15th Lok Sabha while 156 mps belonged to the family background
 patric french ne dikhaaya tha ki 15veen loksabhaa main rashtriya lokdal 100 percent khandaani thi
 All its mps are dynastic
 purv pradhanmantri choudhary charan singh, ajit singh or unke bete jayant choudhary
 The 16th Lok Sabha is currently running
 kanchan chandra kii ek kitaab he, democratic dynasties, state party and family in contemporary indian politics, cambries uniwarsity press se chhapi yah kitaab 7645 rupee kii he
 According to this book, 100% of the mps in PMK, CPI are family members
 congress ke 47
 73 percent of the mps are family members
 bijedy main 40 fisadi saansad parivaravaadi hai
 33% of the mps in NCP are family
 bijepi main 14
 89 percent are family
 in adhyayanon se pataa chalata he ki 2009 main 30
 07 percent of the mps were family members, their percentage was reduced to 21 in 2014
 92 pratishat rah gaya
 Research by both Patrick French and Kanchan Chandra has shown that there is familyism in the BJP but less than in many major parties
 kalyaan singh rajyapal hai, unke bete rajvir singh eta se saansad hai or naati sandip singh vidhayak hai
 Rajnath Singh's son Pankaj Singh is also an MLA
 kaisarganj ke saansad brijbhushan singh ke bete pratik bhushan, lalji tandon ke bete ashutosh tanjan vidhayak hai
 Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a minister in the Yogi cabinet, is also an example of familyism
 jayant sinha, anuraag thakur, piyush goyal sahit anek netaa paariwarik prishthbhumi se aate hai
 Due to familyism, he got an opportunity, but did many of them stay in politics because of this quality? Varun Gandhi has his own political identity, apart from the coincidence of Sanjay Gandhi being the father in that identity
 kya varun gandhi ne sultanpur main 1 lakh 80 hazaar vot sanjay gandhi ke naam par paaya hoga yaa apane kaam par
 Why does the public vote, seeing the family name
 kya janata se sawaal nahin he
 Nara Lokesh, son of Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, is also the TDP general secretary, a minister in the father's cabinet
 telugana ke mukhyamantri ke si aar ke bete ke tii ramarao bhi pita kii cabinet main mantri hai
 Is BJP also aggressive against its allies against familyism? Why did the BJP not run a campaign of familism against Uddhav Thackeray, Sukhbir Badal and Chirag Paswan
 rahul gandhi ke adhyaksh banane ko lekar bijepi congress par aakraamak he, jawaab main congress puch rahi he ki amit shah manonayan se adhyaksh bane the yaa chunaav se, bijepi iskaa jawaab nahin de rahi lekin yah sawaal poochkar congress bhi bijepi ke sawaal kaa jawaab nahin de rahi he
 The question is whether there is internal democracy within the parties, is there where familism is there, is there where there is no familism
 agar rahul gandhi ke chayan par eemaandaaree se bahes kerani he to is sawaal par tike rahanaa hoga varanaa koi laabh nahin
 You will not get the ideal example from India
 landan kii raajnneeti se mil saktaa he
 Take the example of the Labor Party
 tippaniyan Corbyn and his group were marginalized in the Labor Party for 30 years
 corbin party ke kaaryakartaaon ke vot se saansad banate rahe
 Whereas he has direct opposition to the party leadership regarding policies
 lebar party ke do do pradhanmantri hue,jinase unka virodh rahaa
 At the local level, the workers continued to win with the vote
 britain main kaaryakarta sthaneey str par ummidavaar chunate hai, iske liye 25 pound fees dekar member banate hai
 The workers choose the MP and the prime ministerial candidate
 ummidavaar banane ke liye netaa baqayda party ke bheetar apni nitiyon ko lekar kaaryakartaaon ke bich prachaar karte hai, bhaashan dete hai jo bharat main nahin hota he
 Even after this, in Britain and America, another type of suit like familyism arises of wealth and nobility
 britain main to kai pradhanmantri ek hi skool yaa kalege ke padhe hue banate rahe
 This is also a kind of oligarchy in itself
 phir bhi bharat ke system se yah kahin behatar he ki party kaa ummidavaar koun hoga kaaryakarta tay karenge na ki sangh parivaar na hi gandhi parivaar
 Jawaharlal Nehru was made Prime Minister by Mahatma Gandhi
 azaadi kii ladaai ke dauraan nehru 9 saal jail main rahe the
 Kamala Nehru, Nehru's wife, was herself a freedom fighter
 nehru ke pita motilaal nehru bhi azaadi ke nayak the
 Nehru's sister Vijay Lakshmi Pandit was a freedom fighter
 nehru ke jivan main hi 1959 main indira gandhi congress adhyaksh ban gai thim
 Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy became president in 1960
 1969 main sindicket se loha lete hue indira gandhi ne apni party banaai
 Indira Gandhi had to prove more in politics
 congress ai banaai thim
 Losing and winning is a different story
 indira gandhi ke samay main parivaarwaad kii buniyaad padi
 Rajiv Gandhi became Prime Minister but Sonia Gandhi remained in the post of President, Manmohan Singh became Prime Minister
 bijepi aarope lagaati rahi he ki satta sonia ke paas he, manmohan kathputli hai
 Even after this, the Congress won the election in 2009 when Manmohan Singh was Prime Minister
 sonia gandhi adhyaksh thim magar wo chunaav manmohan singh kaa tha
 Manmohan Singh lost in 2014
 sardaar patel kaa bhi parivaar raajnneeti main rahaa he
 Vitthalbhai Patel was the eldest brother of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 unhone si aar das, motilaal nehru ke saath swaraj party bana lee thi
 Vitthalbhai Patel was the president and speaker of the Central Legislative Assembly in 1925
 unheen ke chote bhai sardaar ballab bhai patel grahamantri bane
 Patel was identified not with the younger brother of Vitthalbhai, but from the peasant movement in Bardoli
 sardaar patel kii maut ke baad nehru ne 1952 main unki beti maniben ko loksabhaa kaa tikat diya
 On the dispute, Nehru said that she is a daughter but has been involved in the freedom struggle since 1930
 1957 main patel kii beti maniben patel or bete dayabhai patel donon loksabhaa kaa chunaav lade, jite
 Later Maniben Patel also became a member of Rajya Sabha but after that the Patel family was not heard
 aaj patel parivaar kaa us viraasat par koi daawa nahin he
 He has no party
 laal bahadur shastri kaa parivaar bhi raajnneeti main aayaa magar utane eemaandaar or sade netaa ke beton ko khaas raajnneetik laabh nahin mila
 While one stayed in Congress and the other in BJP
 biju patnayak ke bete naveen patnayak bhi usee kii misaal hai
 In India's politics, one to one leaders were born outside the purview of families, who changed politics, but their party also went into the lap of familyism
 rahul gandhi bahut dinon tak is parivaarwaad ko lekar sankoch main rahe magar ab lagata he ki is aalochana se ubar gaye hai, magar yah sawaal unka peechha karata rahegaa
 During the Lok Sabha elections, Rahul Gandhi had said in an interview to Times Now that 'I do not take the name of my family again and again, i must have taken it once or twice only, the point is that i was born in this family, this is my selection was not
 maine dastakhat nahin kiye the ki main is parivaar main paidaa hona chaahunga
 i am against the concept of dynasty
 ' Rahul should also be asked and the same question Uddhav Thackeray, Aditya Thackeray, Prakash Singh Badal, Sukhbir Badal, Mehbooba Mufti, Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Akhilesh Yadav, Lalu Yadav, Tejaswi Yadav, Karunanidhi, Stalin, Ram Vilas Paswan , Chirag Paswan should also be asked
 jawaab koi nahin detaa he
 Is there any rule in BJP that those whose fathers have been Chief Ministers, Ministers or mps will never become party presidents or prime ministers, has BJP said so
 kya jin dalon main adhyaksh kisi parivaar kaa nahin banataa he, vahaan zyada aantarik loktantr he, jawaab he nahin
 Is the election of the President there in accordance with the democratic spirit, the answer is no
 2014 ke ek prime time main isi vishay par maine punjab uniwarsity ke professor ashutosh se baat kii thi tab unhone kaha ki jaise mughal badshaah apni satta ke vistaar ke liye rajput raajaaon se shaadiyaan kiya karte the vaise hi punjab main congress or akali bhale hi alag dal hai magar inke bade netaa aapas main saas, bahu, betaa, damaad, beti or saalaa or sadhu lagate hai
 Giving an example of a leaflet written by Punjab University student Gunarit Kaur in MA, Ashutosh said that Prakash Singh Badal's cabinet minister Aadesh Pratap Singh is his son-in-law
 aadesh punjab main das saal tak congressi mukhyamantri rahe pratap singh kairon ke bete hai
 The wife of Captain Amarinder Singh, wife of Simranjit Singh Mann and daughter-in-law of Congress Chief Minister Harcharan Singh Brar are sisters after Beant Singh
 usee tarah majithia parivaar congressi mana gaya lekin surajeet singh majithia ke bete vikram singh majithia ab akali main hai
 His sister is married to Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal
 vikram khud bhi akali se vidhayak or cabinet mantri hai
 Patrick French has done a serious study in Indian politics about familism
 patric ne 15veen loksabhaa ke 545 saansadon kii paariwarik prishthbhumi kaa adhyayan kiya to 156 saansad paariwarik prishthbhumi se sambandhit the
 Patrick French had shown that the National Lok Dal was 100 per cent family in the 15th Lok Sabha
 iske sabhi saansad khandaani hai
 Former Prime Ministers Chaudhary Charan Singh, Ajit Singh and his son Jayant Chaudhary
 is vakt 16veen loksabhaa chal rahi he
 a book by Kanchan Chandra, democratic dynasties, state party and family in contemporary Indian politics, printed from Cambridges University Press, is worth Rs 7645
 is kitaab ke anusaar piemke, sipiai main 100 fisadi saansad parivaravaadi hai
 47 of Congress
 73 pratishat saansad parivaravaadi hai
 40% of the mps in the BJD are family
 ensipi main 33 fisadi saansad parivaravaadi hai
 14 in BJP
 89 pratishat parivaravaadi hai
 These studies show that 30 in 2009
 07 pratishat saansad parivaravaadi the, unka pratishat 2014 main ghat kar 21
 92 percent remains
 patric french or kanchan chandra donon ke shodh se yahi niklaa he ki bijepi main parivaarwaad to he magar kai pramukh dalon kii tulana main kam he
 Kalyan Singh is the Governor, his son Rajveer Singh is an MP from Etah and grandson Sandeep Singh is the MLA
 rajnath singh ke bete pankaj singh bhi vidhayak hai
 Prateek Bhushan, son of Kaiserganj MP Brij Bhushan Singh, is MLA Ashutosh Tanjan, son of Lalji Tandon
 yogi mantrimandal main mantri reeta bahuguna joshi bhi parivaarwaad kii udhaaharan hai
 Many leaders, including Jayant Sinha, Anurag Thakur, Piyush Goyal, come from family backgrounds
 parivaarwaad ke kaaran inhen mauka mila lekin kya inamen se kai isi khubi ke kaaran raajnneeti main tike rahe? varun gandhi kii apni raajnneetik pahchaan he, us pahchaan main sanjay gandhi ke pita hone ke sanyog ke alaava or kya he
 Should Varun Gandhi have got 1 lakh 80 thousand votes in Sultanpur in the name of Sanjay Gandhi or on his work
 janata kyon vot detii he, parivaar kaa naam dekhakar
 Isn't there a question from the public? andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu ke bete naaraa lokesh bhi tidipi ke mahasachiv hai, pita kii cabinet main mantri hai
 KT Ramarao, son of Telangana Chief Minister KCR, is also a minister in the father's cabinet
 kya bijepi parivaarwaad ke kilaaf apane sahyogi dalon ke kilaaf bhi aakraamak he? bijepi ne uddhav thakare, sukhbir badal or chiraag paswan ke kilaaf parivaarwaad kaa abhiyaan kyon nahin chalaaya
 BJP is aggressive on Congress for Rahul Gandhi becoming president, in response, Congress is asking whether Amit Shah became president from Manonayan or by election, BJP is not answering it but by asking this question, Congress also does not answer bjp's question Has been sawaal yah he ki partiyon ke bheetar aantarik loktantr he, kya vahaan he jahaan parivaarwaad he, kya vahaan he jahaan parivaarwaad nahin he
 If the selection of Rahul Gandhi has to be debated honestly, then this question has to be sustained or else there is no benefit
 adarsh udhaaharan aapako bharat se nahin milegaa
 London politics can be met
 jaise lebar party kaa hi udhaaharan lete hai
 The comments corbin or unka gut lebar party main 30 saal se haashiye par tha
 Corbyn continued to become MP by the vote of party workers
 jabaki nitiyon ko lekar unka party netritv se sidhaa virodh he
 The Labor Party had two Prime Ministers, against whom they opposed
 sthaneey str par kaaryakartaaon ke vot se jitate rahe
 In Britain, activists choose candidates locally, becoming members by paying a fee of £ 25
 kaaryakarta hi saansad or pradhanmantri kaa ummidavaar chunate hai
 To become a candidate, the leaders campaign among the workers about their policies within the party, giving speeches that do not happen in India
 iske baad bhi britain or america main parivaarwaad kii tarah duusari tarah kaa vaad panamaa dhan or kuleenata kaa
 In Britain, many Prime Ministers continued to be educated in the same school or college
 yah bhi apane aap main ek tarah kaa kulinavaad he
 Nevertheless, it is far better than India's system that the workers will decide who will be the party's candidate, not the Sangh Parivar nor the Gandhi Parivar
 indira gandhi ko zyaada sabit karnaa padaa raajnneeti main
 Congress was formed
 haari or jitati raheen wo alag kahani he
 In Indira Gandhi's time, the foundation of familism was laid
 rajeev gandhi pradhanmantri bane magar sonia gandhi adhyaksh pad par hi raheen, manmohan singh pradhanmantri bane
 The BJP continues to allege that power is with Sonia, Manmohan is a puppet
 iske baad bhi manmohan singh ke pradhanmantri rahete congress ne 2009 main chunaav jeeta tha
 Sonia Gandhi was the president but the election was for Manmohan Singh
 manmohan singh 2014 main haar gaye
 Sardar Patel's family has also been in politics
 vitthal bhai patel sardaar vallabh bhai patel ke sage bade bhai the
 He formed the Swaraj Party with CR Das, Motilal Nehru
 vitthal bhai patel 1925 main central legislative asambeli ke adhyaksh or spikar the
 His younger brother Sardar Ballabh Bhai Patel became the Home Minister
 patel kii pahchaan vitthal bhai ke chote bhai se nahin, bardoli ke kisaan andolan se thi
 After the death of Sardar Patel, Nehru gave his daughter Maniben a Lok Sabha ticket in 1952
 vivaad hone par nehru ne kaha ki ve beti hai magar 1930 se azaadi kii ladaai main shaamil hai
 Patel's daughter Maniben Patel and son Dayabhai Patel both contested the Lok Sabha elections in 1957
 baad main maniben patel rajya sabha kii sadsy bhi huin magar iske baad patel parivaar sunai nahin diya
 Today, the Patel family has no claim on that legacy
 unki koi party nahin he
 Lal Bahadur Shastri's family also came into politics but the sons of that honest and simple leader did not get any special political benefit
 jabaki ek congress main rahe or duusare bijepi main
 Biju Patnaik's son Naveen Patnaik is also an example
 bharat kii raajnneeti main pariwaron ke daayre se baahar ek se ek netaa bhi paidaa hue jinhone raajnneeti badal di magar unki banaai party bhi parivaarwaad kii god main chali gai
 Rahul Gandhi has been hesitant about this familyism for a long time, but now it seems that he has overcome this criticism, but this question will continue to follow him
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke samay rahul gandhi ne times nau ko die intervyuu main kaha tha ki 'main apane parivaar kaa baar baar naam nahin letaa hum, ek yaa do baar hi liya hoga asli, mudda yah he ki is parivaar main main paidaa hua yah meraa chayan nahin tha
 i did not sign that i would like to be born into this family
 main vanshavaad kii avadharana ke khilaaf hum
 ' rahul se bhi poocha janaa chahie or yahi sawaal uddhav thakare, aditya thakare, prakaash singh badal, sukhbir badal, mahabuuba mufti, faruq abdulla, omar abdulla, mulaayam singh yadav, akhilesh yadav, lalu yadav, tejasvi yadav, karunanidhi, stallin, ramvilas paswan, chiraag paswan se bhi poocha janaa chahie
 Nobody answers
 kya bijepi main koi aisa niyam he ki jinke pita mukhyamantri, mantri yaa saansad rahe hai ve kabhi party adhyaksh yaa pradhanmantri nahin banenge, kya bijepi ne aisa kaha he
 Is there more internal democracy in the parties where the president does not become a family, the answer is no
 kya vahaan adhyaksh pad kaa loktantric bhaavana ke anuroop nirvachan hota he, jawaab he nahin
 i spoke to Professor Ashutosh of Punjab University on this subject in a prime time of 2014 when he said that the Congress and the Akali, even though separate parties in Punjab, used to marry like Rajput kings to expand their power
 But their big leaders are in-law, daughter-in-law, son, son-in-law, daughter-in-law and brother-in-law
 ashutosh ne punjab uniwarsity kii chaatra gunarit cor ke eme main likhe parche kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki prakaash singh badal ke cabinet mantri aadesh pratap singh unke damaad hai
 Adesh is the son of Pratap Singh Kairon, a Congress chief minister in Punjab for ten years
 captain amarinder singh kii patni, simranjit singh maan kii patni or beant singh ke baad congress ke mukhyamantri haracharan singh baraar kii bahu aapas main bahanen hai
 Similarly, the Majithia family was considered a Congressman but Surjit Singh Majithia's son Vikram Singh Majithia is now in Akali
 unki bahan kii shaadi dipti siem sukhbir singh badal se hui he
 Vikram himself is also an MLA and cabinet minister from Akali
 bhartiya raajnneeti main parivaarwaad ko lekar patric french ne ek gambhir adhyayan kiya he
 Patrick studied the family background of 545 mps of the 15th Lok Sabha while 156 mps belonged to the family background
 patric french ne dikhaaya tha ki 15veen loksabhaa main rashtriya lokdal 100 percent khandaani thi
 All its mps are dynastic
 purv pradhanmantri choudhary charan singh, ajit singh or unke bete jayant choudhary
 The 16th Lok Sabha is currently running
 kanchan chandra kii ek kitaab he, democratic dynasties, state party and family in contemporary indian politics, cambries uniwarsity press se chhapi yah kitaab 7645 rupee kii he
 According to this book, 100% of the mps in PMK, CPI are family members
 congress ke 47
 73 percent of the mps are family members
 bijedy main 40 fisadi saansad parivaravaadi hai
 33% of the mps in NCP are family
 bijepi main 14
 89 percent are family
 in adhyayanon se pataa chalata he ki 2009 main 30
 07 percent of the mps were family members, their percentage was reduced to 21 in 2014
 92 pratishat rah gaya
 Research by both Patrick French and Kanchan Chandra has shown that there is familyism in the BJP but less than in many major parties
 kalyaan singh rajyapal hai, unke bete rajvir singh eta se saansad hai or naati sandip singh vidhayak hai
 Rajnath Singh's son Pankaj Singh is also an MLA
 kaisarganj ke saansad brijbhushan singh ke bete pratik bhushan, lalji tandon ke bete ashutosh tanjan vidhayak hai
 Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a minister in the Yogi cabinet, is also an example of familyism
 jayant sinha, anuraag thakur, piyush goyal sahit anek netaa paariwarik prishthbhumi se aate hai
 Due to familyism, he got an opportunity, but did many of them stay in politics because of this quality? Varun Gandhi has his own political identity, apart from the coincidence of Sanjay Gandhi being the father in that identity
 kya varun gandhi ne sultanpur main 1 lakh 80 hazaar vot sanjay gandhi ke naam par paaya hoga yaa apane kaam par
 Why does the public vote, seeing the family name
 kya janata se sawaal nahin he
 Nara Lokesh, son of Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, is also the TDP general secretary, a minister in the father's cabinet
 telugana ke mukhyamantri ke si aar ke bete ke tii ramarao bhi pita kii cabinet main mantri hai
 Is BJP also aggressive against its allies against familyism? Why did the BJP not run a campaign of familism against Uddhav Thackeray, Sukhbir Badal and Chirag Paswan
 rahul gandhi ke adhyaksh banane ko lekar bijepi congress par aakraamak he, jawaab main congress puch rahi he ki amit shah manonayan se adhyaksh bane the yaa chunaav se, bijepi iskaa jawaab nahin de rahi lekin yah sawaal poochkar congress bhi bijepi ke sawaal kaa jawaab nahin de rahi he
 The question is whether there is internal democracy within the parties, is there where familism is there, is there where there is no familism
 agar rahul gandhi ke chayan par eemaandaaree se bahes kerani he to is sawaal par tike rahanaa hoga varanaa koi laabh nahin
 You will not get the ideal example from India
 landan kii raajnneeti se mil saktaa he
 Take the example of the Labor Party
 tippaniyan Corbyn and his group were marginalized in the Labor Party for 30 years
 corbin party ke kaaryakartaaon ke vot se saansad banate rahe
 Whereas he has direct opposition to the party leadership regarding policies
 lebar party ke do do pradhanmantri hue,jinase unka virodh rahaa
 At the local level, the workers continued to win with the vote
 britain main kaaryakarta sthaneey str par ummidavaar chunate hai, iske liye 25 pound fees dekar member banate hai
 The workers choose the MP and the prime ministerial candidate
 ummidavaar banane ke liye netaa baqayda party ke bheetar apni nitiyon ko lekar kaaryakartaaon ke bich prachaar karte hai, bhaashan dete hai jo bharat main nahin hota he
 Even after this, in Britain and America, another type of suit like familyism arises of wealth and nobility
 britain main to kai pradhanmantri ek hi skool yaa kalege ke padhe hue banate rahe
 This is also a kind of oligarchy in itself
 phir bhi bharat ke system se yah kahin behatar he ki party kaa ummidavaar koun hoga kaaryakarta tay karenge na ki sangh parivaar na hi gandhi parivaar
 Sardar Patel's family has also been in politics
