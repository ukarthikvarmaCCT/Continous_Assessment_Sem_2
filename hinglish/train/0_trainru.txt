 One of the election promises of the Modi government was also to create one crore new jobs every year
 par yah lakshya kaaphi peeche chhot gaya or notebandi se bhi isamen madad milane kii bajaae ulate 2017 ke pehle chaar maheenon main 15 lakh naukariyaan chali gayi
 In an attempt to respond to these arguments, the government has outlined a report by two economic experts earlier this year citing EPFO data that seventy million new jobs will be created in India in 2017-18
 ''laapata aankadon" kaa sawaal bhi ''laapata naukariyon" jitna hi praasangik he
 Our experts say that there is a new thinking about job creation
 Data from EPFO shows that 60-70 lakh new jobs are being created

 On the other hand, most of the jobs will be created by the private sector
 sarkaar main hamaara dhyaan unhen sakasham banane vaali nitiyaan or maahaul taiyaar karne kaa he
 For example, the aviation sector is booming, as we have left the market forces open, allowing the airline companies to provide the services they want to Indian consumers
 hamaare akaash main is vakt 550 vimaan hai or 1,000 vimaanon ke order die ja chuke hai
 Demonetisation helped us control the informal and black economy, the formal nature of the economy grew and the cash to GDP ratio decreased

 The structural issues we have inherited will take decades to rectify and we are doing exactly that

 yadi gale se sar ko kaat de to hamaara sharir mrit ho jaataa he, vaise hi agar ham ped ke jad ko kaat den to ped mar jaataa he
 It means to say that we are siblings of Prithvi Mata, and we are siblings

 bas antar ye he kii hamaare sharir kaa jad yani mashtishk upar hota he or baaki sharir ke ang yani tana neeche
 If the head is cut off from the neck, our body becomes dead, similarly if we cut the root of the tree, the tree dies

 Sonia Gandhi, who has been given the post of Congress President to Rahul, is still trying to be the axis of opposition to form an alliance against Modi
 isi ke maddenjar unhone mangalvaar ko apane ghar par tamaam vipakshi party ke netaaon ko dinar par bulaayaa he
 As the Congress Parliamentary Party President, Sonia tries to mobilize the opposition for 2019
 is dinar se pehle baithkon main aane vaale 18 dal ke netaa yaa unke numaayinde shaamil honge, lekin sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav, basapa supremeo mayawati, trinmul supremeo mamata banerjee or ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ne ab tak shaamil hone par sahmati nahin di he
 However, Sonia's manager is still trying to get at least Pawar and Mamta to attend, but they have not been successful so far
 haalanki in sabhi ne apane numaayinde bhejne par sahmati de di he
 With two arrows from an arrow, Sonia wants to hit two with an arrow through this dinner diplomacy
 vipakshi netaaon ko dinar par bulaakar vah ye sabit karnaa chaahati hai ki modi ke vikalp ke taur par banane vaale gathjod kaa netritv congress ke paas hi hoga
 The demand for time for unity: a big message from Sonia Gandhi is that she does not favor Mamta and Pawar's efforts to lead the Third Front
 aise main khud mamata or sharad pavaar kaa dinar se ab tak dur rahanaa congress ke liye mushkilen khadi karne vaala he
 However, the Congress believes that everyone will have to unite against Modi and this is the responsibility of the entire opposition
 is mudde par congress netaa pramod tiwari ne kaha, vaqt kaa takaza he ki sabhi saath aaen, aaj tisare-chauthe morche ke koi matlab nahin hai
 However, the Congress understands that leaders like Pawar and Mamta are hesitant about Rahul Gandhi's leadership
 isiilie sonia 2019 tak gathbandhan kii kaman apane haath main rakhana chaahati hai
 After all, both of these people have been doing politics to become leaders of opposition
 mamata kii alag raahyahi vah baat he jo congress ko raas nahin aati
 Mamta called Telangana CM KCR to find an alternative to the Third Front
 tidipi or tiares ne congress kii balldor se kii gai koshishon ke baavjood bhoj main aane se philhal inkaar kar diya he
 On the other hand, if you talk about Maratha Kshatrap, then there were many occasions when Pawar did not take any time to shock the Congress
 jari rahegi koshishaise main 2019 ke liye modi virdohi gathbandhan kii tasviir siyaasi hichkole to khaati hi rahegi, lekin iske chalate party apni koshishon main kami nahin rakhana chaahati
 After all, the Congress also realizes that the outcome of the upcoming state assembly elections will decide whether all fall under its flag or not
 a new leader is born
 a leader India needs
 a leader with a new- truly Gandhian- philosophy of politics
 Politics of idealism, of love, of service, of inclusion, of dialogue
 Today I'm even more convinced: # congresspresidentrahulgandhi will, and should, become India's next PM

 ' a document in secret files related to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, made public by the West Bengal government, is raising many questions
 yah may 1946 kaa ek gupt police memo he, jisamen ek chitthee kaa zikr he
 This letter was sent by Netaji's wife Emili Shankal to Netaji's elder brother Sarat Chandra Bose from Vienna
 haalanki is chitthee kaa nichalaa hissaa fata hua he, jisase sawaal uthne lage hai ki kya netaji kii patni maanati thi ki 1945 main hue vimaan haadase main unki maut ho gai thi? The bottom of the letter is torn, though it indicates that Subhash Chandra Bose's wife also believed that Netaji had died
 lekin yah bhi sawaal uthta he ki kya kisi ne jaanboojh kar chitthee ko is tarah phada tha
 The author, historian and patriarch of Ashoka University, 'nehru and Bose: Parallel Lives', Rudrashu Mukherjee, however, does not believe so
 tippaniyan He says, 'actually in that police memo it is said that in that letter he (shankel) had described himself as Bose's widow and said that he was shocked by Netaji's death in the plane crash
 haa, chitthee kaa nichalaa hissaa jarur fat gaya he
 But this was done deliberately, it is not known
 
 
 puraane dastavejon ke saath aisa katnaa fatna to laga hi rahata he
 ' netaji ke rishtedaar or netaji research beuro ke pramukh krishna bose kehete hai, vah emily shenkal se mili hai
 He says, 'amelie aunty told us that she was working in the kitchen of her home in Vienna, when it was suddenly announced on the radio that Indian' malevolent 'subhash Chandra Bose died in a plane crash
 ham jaanate hai ki us vakt or baad main unhone jarur is baat ko hakeekat maan lee, lekin unhen hameshaa ummid lagi rahati thi netaji kabhi laut aaen
 This is a natural thing
 praapt jaankaree ke mutabik, emily or netaji kii mulaakaat berlin main 1941 main hui thi or donon ne 1942 main shaadi kar lee thi
 Emily had also mentioned in a letter that Netaji and her marriage were held in Germany with Hindu customs, but the marriage could not be registered
 is chitthee kaa nichalaa hissaa fata hua he, haalanki isse aisa sanket miltaa he ki subhash chandra bose kii patni bhi maanati thi ki netaji kii maut ho chuki he
 But it also raises the question whether someone deliberately tore the letter in this way
 'nehru or bose : parlel livs' ke lekhak, itihaaskaar or ashoka uniwarsity ke kulapati rudranshu mukherjee haalanki aisa nahin maanate
 The comments vah kehete hai, 'asal main us police memo main kaha gaya he ki us chitthee main unhone (shenkal ne) khud ko bose kii vidhwaa bataaya tha or kaha tha ki vah vimaan haadase main netaji kii maut se sadame main hai
 Yes, the bottom of the letter is definitely torn
 lekin yah jaanboojh kar kiya gaya, nahin maaloom hota he
 
 
 With old documents, such a disconnection continues
 ' Krishna Bose, a relative of Netaji and head of the Netaji Research Bureau, says he has met Emily Shankel
 vah kehete hai, 'ameli chachee ne hamen bataaya tha ki vah vienna main apane ghar kii rasoi main kaam kar rahi thi, tabhi achaanak radio par ghoshnaa hui ki bhartiya 'drohi' subhash chandra bose kii vimaan durghatana main maut ho gai
 We know that at that time and later he certainly accepted this fact, but he always hoped that Netaji should return
 yah to swaabhaavik si baat hai
 According to the information received, Emily and Netaji met in Berlin in 1941 and both married in 1942
 emily ne ek patr main yah bhi bataaya tha ki netaji or unki shaadi hindu reeti-rivaajon ke saath germany main hui thi, lekin shaadi kaa panjikaran nahin ho paaya

 On the 8th, the Prime Minister will rally in Vijayapura, Bangalore
 vahiin 9 taarikh ko kolar, belagavi or bidar main raily ko sambodhit karenge
 Let me tell you that the Prime Minister started campaigning in Karnataka on 1 May
 uske baad se lagaataar ve karnataka chunaav se jude hue hai
 The day the Prime Minister does not address the rally, on that day he addresses the workers through the app
 isse pehle bhi piem kisaan morcha, mahila morcha or rajya ke ummidavaaron ko namo ap ke jariye sambodhit kar chuke hai
 How effective Namo app? Let me tell you that more than 1 crore people have downloaded this app so far

 Most people consider both yoga and exercise to be the same but this is not the case
 in donon kaa apana-apana mahatv hota he
 Yoga is not just a workout
 kasarat main to aap sirf shaareerik prakriya karte hai lekin yoga main aap shaareerik, maansik evam bhavanatmak prakriya karte hai
 Yogasan maintains the stability of the body while exercise increases the mobility of the body
 aaie jaanate hai yoga or vyaayaam (eksrasij) main antar-eksrasij main aap apni saanson par dhyaan nahin dete or saansen kaaphi tej ho jaati hai
 In yoga, balance is taught on the breath and breathing is done on the basis of posture
 yogasana aantarik angon par adhik prabhaav daalata he
 While exercising, the body appears strong from outside
 yogasana se sharir lacheela rahata he jabaki vyaayaam se mansapeshiyon main kadaapan aa jaataa he
 Exercise emphasizes intensity and strength, which can also cause muscle damage
 yoga dhimi gati se kiya jaataa he or sahanshakti badhaata he
 The muscles are not weakened by yoga
 eksrasij se pachan shakti tej ho jaati he jisase bhukh zyada lagati he or insaan adhik khaataa he
 Digestion power is slowed by yoga, which reduces appetite and a person starts eating less
 eksrasij se teji se urja kharch hoti he jisase aap thak jate hai
 While doing yoga, energy is slowly spent so that you do not get tired but feel refreshed
 eksrasij ke liye aapako paryaapt jagah or saadhan / saamaan kii jarurat hoti he lekin yoga ke liye aapako sirf ek mat or thodi si jagah kii jarurat hoti he
 You do not have to focus your attention while exercising
 yoga karte samay aapako apni saanson or aasaan par dhyaan kendrit karnaa hota he jisase sharir ke prati jaagrukta badhati he
 Yoga increases mental power and brings the power to control the senses
 eksrasij main koi siddhant nahin hota jabaki yoga paanch siddhanton par aadhaarit he: sahi bhojan, sahi soch, sahi saansen, niyamit vyaayaam or aaraam
 Exercise cannot be done by a person of every age, such as an elderly or sick person
 yoga har umr kaa vyakti kar saktaa he
 a sick person can also do some easy breathing

 One example of the extent to which the Global and Google periods have improved or worsened our awareness is our apathy about the Israeli attack on Gaza
 channel abhi-abhi vaidic kaal se nikal ashok singhl ke muslim virdohi bayaan kaal main pravesh kar gaye hai
 But when local was better and when global, for this i take you to two types of time zones
 tab jab 700 news channel nahin the or twitor par lakhon log ek netaa ko pholo nahin karte the
 The month was July but the year was 1936
 bharat apni azaadi kii ladaai lard rahaa tha
 The Palestine Conference is convened in Allahabad in July 1936, with many big leaders like Ram Manohar Lohia, JP Kripalani and Shaukat Ali taking part
 isi saal upi ke har zile main philistin ke prati bhaichara jataane ke liye congress philistin diwas manaati he
 Think, it was celebrating Palestine Day in Etawah, Saharanpur and today there is no movement anywhere
 tab congress par dabaav padataa tha ki jis tarah turki main osmania samrajya ke ant or apmanjanak samjhaute ke khilaaf congress ne line lee thi, usee tarah philistin ke sawaal par bhi le
 The leaders then saw the Khilafat, not the question of Palestine, from the Hindu Muslim angle
 khilaafat kaa saath dene waalon main lala lajpat raay or madan mohan malviya jaise netaa bhi the
 Rather it was taken care not to see Palestine's support as anti-jewish, but this did not stop Congress from passing the resolution on Palestine every year
 mahatma gandhi ne philistin ke sawaal par kaha tha, philistin arabon kaa he jis tarah england english kaa he, france french kaa
 The imposition of the Jews on the Arabs is wrong and inhuman
 ab aate hai july 2014 ke bharat main
 Today all the cities of India are silent
 koi netaa nahin he jo apane rozaana ke pradarshnon ko roak kar desh kaa dhyaan is ore khinch sake
 Even our Parliament could not form a consensus for mere discussion on this issue
 buudhvaar ko rajyasabha main gaaza ko lekar charchaa list ho gai thi, magar videshmantri sushamaa swaraj ne sabhapati ko likhaa ki yah charchaa kisi niyam ke tahat sweekaar nahin he or na hi vaanchit arthath dizyreble nahin he
 The opposition created a ruckus and the proceedings of the Rajya Sabha were adjourned
 brihaspativaar ko sabhapati ne kaha ki sadan ke netaa arun jetali ne aagrah kiya he ki charchaa taal di jaae
 The members of the opposition then created a ruckus and said that once a discussion is listed, it becomes the property of the House
 aisa karnaa asanvaidhanik he
 So the Rajya Sabha adjourned after the uproar
 buudhvaar ko videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj bayaan detii hai ki hamaara donon deshon se rajanyik sambandh hai
 Any rude remarks towards a friendly nation can affect our relationship with them
 magar brazil main bricks netaaon ke saamne pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa bayaan sushamaa swaraj ke bayaan se kaaphi alag balki ulat dikhataa he
 On Tuesday, five BRICS countries condemned Israel's attack on Gaza
 vahaan narendra modi ne kaha ki excilencis afghanistan se lekar africa tak ke ilaakon main takaraav or ufaan kaa daur chal rahaa he
 Serious instability is brewing and we are all affected
 mulk ke mulk taar taar ho rahe hai
 Having a silent audience can have dangerous consequences
 phir charchaa karne se kya dar he
 Palestine Day was celebrated in Uttar Pradesh in 1936 and we could not discuss a day in the 2014 Rajya Sabha regarding the attack on Palestine Gaza
 8 april 2003 ko iraq par amareeki hamale ke khilaaf hamaari sansad ne sarvasammati se prastaav paas kiya tha
 Did this worsen our relations with America? is prastaav kaa samarthan bijepi se lekar left tak sabane kiya tha
 Protests are taking place all over the world
 spain, neuyark, landan, tokyo sahit kai mulkon main
 But the Indians who went global through Whats Up, Facebook and Twitter are oblivious
 brihaspativaar ko kashmir main band kaa aayojan kiya gaya to sipiem ne dilli or kolkata main pradarshan kiya
 Aisa did it
 congress ne koi pradarshan nahin kiya, magar manishankar ayyar philistin duutavas zarur gaye
 After all, what time have we come, where such pictures are being shared
 israel ke log kursi lagaakar baithe hai or gaaza par girte bamon ke dhamaake sunakar taaliyaan bajaate hai
 Such newspapers of AFP will not be published in which newspaper of the world
 yah tasviir ek dach patrkaar ke twit se duniya bhar main pahunchi jisamen log popcorn khate hue hukka pite hue gaaza par girte bamon kaa lutf uthaa rahe hai
 Israel has been attacking Gaza for ten days
 atharah lakh logon kii aabaadi vaala gaaza ghir gaya he
 1370 houses have been destroyed
 aabaadi kaa bada hissaa bijli pani se vanchit ho gaya he
 230 people have been killed
 marane waalon main bacchon kii bhi badi sankhya he
 The schools have been demolished
 aspataal viklang kendron par hamalaa kiya gaya he
 In today's Hindu newspaper, Professor Vijay Prasad of Trinity College has written that Israel cannot punish Gaza, a terrorist organization named Hamas
 gaaza ko hamaas maan lenaa or puri aabaadi ko hamaas ke liye kasuurvaar tehraana antarrashtriya kanoon ke hisaab se bhi galat he
 On July 9, Israel's deputy speaker expelled three Palestinian-origin lawmakers from his room
 kaha ki gaaza main bijli kaat deni chahie taaki uske aspataal thapp pad jaaen
 Israel is saying that when Hamas is following the culture of death, then its answer is also death
 hamaas inkaar kar rahaa he ki usne israel ke teen kishoron kaa apharan kiya jiske baad ye tazaa hamala shuru hua
 UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon says that Gaza is currently on the edge of the knife
 10 july ko suraksha parishad kii baithak hui
 America Egypt is demanding all ceasefire but Israel is not listening to anyone
 kya bijepi yaa modi sarkaar israel se apane kareebi sambandhon yaa rujhaan ke kaaran charchaa kaa virodh kar rahi he
 Can India afford to offend Israel

 Before the commencement of Navratri, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) on Tuesday issued a directive not to allow non-hindus, including Muslims and Christians, to attend the garba programs in residential societies in Gujarat
 sanghathan ne kaha ki rajyabar main garba sthalon par uske swayamsevak is baat par kadi najar rakhenge ki gaiyr hindu in sthalon par pravesh karne kaa prayaas to nahin kar rahe hai
 The VHP said that any Muslims who want to enjoy the garba will be provided an option to embrace Hinduism at the venue
 gujarat vihip ke mahasachiv ranchhod bharwar ne kaha ki gaiyr hinduon par pabandi keval rihaayshi socytiyon main yojit chote garba kaaryakramon main lagu hogi na ki klbon evam anya vanijyik kaaryakramon main
 The comments unhone kaha, ham rajyabar main sabhi gaiyr hinduon chaahe, ve musalmaan ho yaa isai, ko garba sthalon par pravesh karne se parhez karne kii chetavanee dete hai
 Such Hindu festivals are used by Muslim youth as a tool to trap our girls
 aisi pabandi lav jihad kii ghatnaon ko rokane ke liye jaruri he
 He said, apart from love jihad, it is also to be noted that Navratri is a sacred religious festival of Hindus
 is prakaar, dusron ko uskaa hissaa banane dene ke liye utsahit karnaa uchit nahin he
 Apart from taking steps on our behalf, we will persuade the societies to implement this ban at our level
 jab dharwar se kaha gaya ki pradhanmantri 'sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas' kii baat karte hai, aise main is nirdesh kii kya praasangikta he, unhone kaha ki navaratri koi sarkari kaarykram nahin he

 "we warn all non-hindus across the state, whether Muslims or Christians, to refrain from entering Garba sites," he said
 aise hindu tyoharon kaa muslim yuvak hamaari ladakiyon ko fansaane ke liye aujaar ke rup main istemaal karte hai
 Such prohibition is necessary to prevent the incidents of love jihad
 unhone kaha, lav jihad ke alaava, yah bhi dhyaan rakhana hoga ki navaratri hinduon kaa paavan dharmik tyohaar he
 Thus, it is not appropriate to encourage others to be part of it
 hamaari ore se kadam uthaae jane ke alaava ham socytiyon ko apane str par is pabandi ko lagu karne ke liye raji karenge
 When Dharwad was told that the Prime Minister talks about 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas', what is the relevance of this directive, he said that Navratri is not a government program

 sarkaar ke notebandi ke elaan ke baad 9 november se lekar 2 disambar tak deshbhar ke toll naakon par toll vasuuli nahin hui thi jiske kaaran nijee toll operataron ko kaafii nuksaan uthaanaa padaa

 lekin is faisle ke baad toll sanchaalkon ko nuksaan nahin hoga
 NHAI has accounted for this loss according to the average October recovery on toll points
 ye bhugtan kul 317 nijee toll sanchaalkon ko kiya jayega
 Actually the loss was about 1200 crores but NHAI will pay only 922 crores under PPP model
 notebandi ke baad 22 din toll naakon par gaadiyaan bina toll die nikalati raheen
 The proposal has now been sent to the Economic Committee of the Cabinet
 enechaeai ko dar he ki agar unhone nuksaan kii bharpai nahin kii to toll sanchaalak unke khilaaf court bhi ja sakate hai kyonki enechaeai or toll sanchaalkon ke contract kii ek shart he ki agar sarkari faisle se agar in toll sanchaalkon ko nuksaan hoga to uski bharpai enechaeai ko kerani hogi
 But after this decision, toll operators will not suffer
 is nuksaan kaa hisaab enechaeai ne toll naakon par oktober kii ausat vasuuli ke mutabik lagaaya he
 These payments will be made to a total of 317 private toll operators
 asal main nuksaan lagbhag 1200 karod kaa hua lekin enechaeai pipipi model ke tahat 922 karod kaa hi bhugtan karegaa
 NHAI has accounted for this loss according to the average October recovery on toll points
 ye bhugtan kul 317 nijee toll sanchaalkon ko kiya jayega

 Indian hacker Anand Prakash has revealed the major drawback of the American cab service Uber
 iske liye company ne use inaam diya he
 This is not the first time this hacker has been given a bounty
 isse pehle bhi ubar ne anand ko ubar sahit fasebuk jaisi badi companiyon se inaam mil chukaa he
 So far, they have received about 26 lakh rupees from Uber
 yah unhen ubar kii bag bounty program ke tahat diya gaya he
 This time they have found flaws in the internal app above
 kai third party eps jaise tapjo or iji go, in eps ke jariye aap ubar kii ride book kar sakate hai
 Can access the service of Paytm
 ye ek tarah ke plateform hote hai jo van stop shop kaa kaam karte hai
 For this, Uber gives a password to these third party apps, which Vubar accesses
 yani ubar ko apane plateform par laa kar ise yuj karte hai
 Anand Prakash found the password issued by Uber on the platform of these third party apps through the Uber app
 yah maamla kaaphi gambhir he or yah kaaphi mushkil bhi he
 Anand Prakash has told in a special conversation with Tech till date that he reported this flaw in October itself
 iske baad ubar ne unase ise kisi ko na bataane ko kaha tha or ye bhi mana tha kii yah kaaphi gambhir samasya he or ise fiks kiya ja rahaa he
 Last week, Uber advised all developers who use the Uber app on their platform to change their passwords via email and have changed passwords of large developers themselves
 is gambhir khami kii vajah se koi haikar ubar ap ke jariye third party eps kaa password lekar un eps ke saath ched chhaad kar saktaa tha
 Let me tell you that some part of the information collected from you also gives to third party apps platform, overcome by your permission
 udhaaharan ke taur par aap tapjo jaise eps ko le sakate hai
 Overall, if a hackers finds their password, then they can easily manipulate those apps
 chunki maamla password chori karne kaa tha aise main koi ataikar aasaani se apane acount ko ubar ap se conect karke sarwar token hasil kar saktaa tha
 It is called Client Secret
 ubar ne apana data API se hataa kar is khami ko thik kiya he
 Anand Prakash informed the Uber Security team about this flaw on 5 October
 duusare hi din ubar kaa respons aayaa or kaha gaya ki wo developers ko is bare main bataa rahe hai or ise fiks karne kii taiyaari chal rahi he
 On February 8, Uber rewarded Anand with $ 5,000 (about Rs
 3 lakh 56 thousand) and after this the matter was made public
 ashubh jyeshtha maas khatm ho gaya he

 BJP national general secretary Ananth Kumar has called for mentioning the mention of 'babri Masjid' in the Congress party's manifesto as an injury to Hindu sentiments and disregarding the High Court's decision to apologize to the people of the country
 kumaar ne samvaadadatao se baatcheet main kaha, ‘main congress party or kendra main sattarum uski sarkaar se yah poochna chahta hum ki vah ayodhya main ram janm bhoomi par swaamitv ke maamle main elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ke nirnay ko sweekaar karti he athwa nahin jisane apane sarvasammat nirnay main use ramajanm sthaan bataaya he
 The BJP general secretary said that the Ayodhya issue is under consideration of the Supreme Court and the entire nation is waiting for an early and final stamp by the Supreme Court on the unanimous decision of the High Court
 ’ aise main yadi congress or uski sarkaar ucch nyaayalay ke nirnay ko maanati he to uske ghoshnaa patr main babari masjid kaa ullekh kyon hua jabaki ram janm sthaan kaa ullekh ek baar bhi nahin kiya gaya
 He alleged that by doing so, the Congress has also indicated that it considers itself the solution to the Ayodhya dispute to rebuild the demolished 'babri Masjid' structure
 anant kumaar ne kaha ki congress ko is mudde par apana or apni sarkaar kaa drushti kone saaf karnaa chahie tathaa hindu bhaawanaao ko chot pahunchane tathaa adaalat ke nirnay kii avhelnaa karne ke liye desh kii janata se maafee maangani chahie
 Referring to the court's decision on Dr
 Subrahmanyan Swamy's plea about being allowed to prosecute corrupt ministers in the 2G scam, Ananth Kumar questioned whether the Prime Minister deliberately gave his office to Dr
 swami ke aavedan kii ek varsh se adhik avadhi tak andekhi karne ke liye kaha tha kyoki 2ji ghotaale main keval tatkaaleen vitt mantri pi
 Not only Chidambaram but the Prime Minister himself is also involved

 ek saal baad lalu reetlal ko vidhaan parishad chunaav main ummidavaar banane main naakaam rahe kyonki patna seat unhen gathbandhan sahyogi janata dal (you) ke liye chhodmai padi
 But the RJD general secretary revolted against Lalu and won by fighting as an independent
 vidhaan parishad chunaav ke parinaam 10 july ko ghoshit hue hai
 On the other hand, Don turned politician and member of the Legislative Council, Hulas Pandey, though not so lucky, his plan was stronger than b Ritlal
 jedy(you) ne jab bhojpur jile se aara kaa tikat argedy ummidavaar radha charan seth ko dene kii vajah se hulas ko dene se manaa kar diya to ve apni vafadari badalte hue ram vilaas paswan kii lok janashakti party (algepi) ke saath ho liye
 But Hulas still failed to save his seat
 argedy se reetlal kaa nikalnaa or nirdaleey emelsi hulas pandeya kaa algepi ke saath janaa is baat kii tasdik karata he ki nitish or lalu kii dosti ke dobaaraa ubharne ke baad bihar main apradhi se netaa bane bahubaliyon ke liye jagah sikudti ja rahi he
 Actually, the two leaders joined hands to stop Narendra Modi's BJP
 2000 ke baad se bihar ke bikhare or toote-phute siyaasi falak main sabase ooncha kad rakhane vaale donon netaaon, nitish or lalu se hi in bahubaliyon ko jaruri takat milti rahi he
 "many musclemen have lost their usefulness to their current boss," says a senior JD (U) leader
 aakhirkaar, naa to nitish or naa hi lalu ko ek-duusare kii khilaafat ke liye bahubaliyon kii jarurat he
 "not yet
" bahubaliyon ne vidhansabha chunaavon main hameshaa mahatvapurn bhoomika adaa kii he
 Before the 2010 assembly elections, Nitish had taken a 'social visit' to his ancestral home seeking the blessings of the murderer and mother of former MP Anand Mohan
 lalu ne bhi us samay sajayaftaa purv saansad mohammad shahabuddin ke saath siwan jail main ghanton vakt guzaara tha
 At the same time, new thinking has emerged about the 2015 assembly elections to be held after about three months
 mana ja rahaa he ki lalu or nitish ko bahubaliyon ko manaane kii jarurat nahin he, kyonki saath aa jane ke baad kagaji taur par in donon ke vot bank sangathit ho gaye hai
 And at least Nitish has tried to convey the same message to his voters by cleaning a Bahubali that they are not going to compromise the promise of good governance even in Lalu's alliance
 jedy(you) vidhayak anant singh kii haalia giraftaar ko nitish kii saaf-suthri chhavi ko chamakaane kii koshish ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 The Chief Minister ordered his arrest after the name of don-turned-mla Anant Singh was revealed in the conspiracy for a case of kidnapping and murder
 2 july ko court main pesh hone par anant ne lalu or unke donon beton ke khilaaf tikhaa bayaan diya lekin nitish par chuppi sadhana pasand kiya
 "they are just waiting for JD (U) to refuse to give tickets," says a supporter of Anant, pointing to Paswan's LJP going into the court
 ''isi tarah hulas ke bade bhai or bahubali jedy(you) vidhayak sunil pandeya bhi janvari main hue aara jila court bam dhamaake maamle main 11 july ko apni giraftaar ke baad apane vikalpon ko aank rahe hai
 After shrinking his political space, Bahubali is also going against his masters
 lalu ke purv sahyogi or argedy se nishkasit saansad pappu yadav rajya main majboot takat ke taur par ubhar rahe hai
 He has formed his own Jan Adhikar Party and is trying to get the Yadav community or at least the group of Yadavs who have been angry with Lalu after going with Nitish
 bijepi ne haalanki thikaana talash rahe bahubaliyon se duuri banaae rakhi he, lekin kaha ja rahaa he ki vah parade ke peeche se pappu yadav ko samarthan de rahi he or ranneetik taur par paswan kii algepi ke jariye pichley daravaaje se unhen endie main pravesh de rahi he
 The BJP leaders who left no opportunity to tell the current Nitish government to be the Jungle Raj Two after an alliance with Lalu, remained silent over Hulas Pandey joining the NDA overnight
 hulas ke fasebuk pej par ab pradhanmantri samet kai endie netaaon kii tasviren saj gai hai
 Why is the LJP sheltering these musclemen and the BJP has turned a blind eye to this? In this regard, a senior LJP leader says, "having muscle power remains beneficial
 vidhansabha chunaav main jeet kaa faasla amuman kaaphi kam hota he or in bahubaliyon kaa sahyog nirnaayak sabit ho saktaa he
 “the clear message is that the phase of Bahubali in Bihar is not over yet

 uttar pradesh kii mukhyamantri mayawati ne congress, bhaajapa sahit sabhi dalon par aarope lagaaya he ki sadiyon se upekshit anya pichde varg ke logon kii ek sochi samajhi ranneeti ke tahat jaateey janaganana na karakar ab tak unhen tamaam adhikaron se vanchit rakhaa gaya
 Mayawati called Prime Minister Dr
 manmohan singh ko likhe patr main anya pichde virgon ke shaikshanik, saamaajik evam aarthik utthan ke liye jati ke aadhaar par janaganana kaa anurodh kiya he
 He blamed all the opposition parties for the educational, social and economic backwardness of the Other Backward Classes and said that by not counting them correctly under a conspiracy, it kept the large society of the country separate from the mainstream of development
 isse desh kii aabaadi kaa sabase bada hissaa apane sanvaidhanik adhikaro se vanchit rahaa, jisamen badi sankhya main dharmik alpsankhyak bhi shaamil he
 Mayawati said that BSP mps first raised the issue of caste-based census in Parliament and now other parties are vying for credit
 unhone kaha ki congress va bhaajapa sahit anya vipakshi dal yadi pichde virgo kii hitaishi hoti to aazaadee ke baad jitani baar janaganana hui he, usamen pichhadi jatiyon kii vaastavik sankhya pataa lagane ke liye jaateey aadhaar par janaganana karne kaa faisla leti or in aankadon ke aadhaar par utthan ke liye vibhinn yojanaayen laati
 Mayawati said that the governments in power at the Center after independence did not deliberately conduct a census on the basis of caste to deprive other backward classes of their constitutional rights so that these people are not aware and organized about their rights
 unhone kaha ki chunki in pichhade virgo main dharmik alpsankhyakon kii ek bahut badi sankhya bhi shaamil he, jinhen kendra satta main rahi sarkaron ne hameshaa upekshit kiya or apana rajnatik varchast banaaye rakhane ke liye vot bank ke rup main istemaal kiya
 Due to this, even after 63 years of independence, there has been no change in the educational, social and economic status of other backward classes in the whole country
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki ve shuru se hi anya pichde virgo ke prati samvedansheel rahi he or jab unhen pehali baar 1995 main satta main aane kaa mauka mila to unhone pichde virgo ke shaikshanik, saamaajik evam aarthik utthan ke liye pichhada varg kalyaan vibhaag kaa swatantra rup se gathan kiya
 He said that along with this, various schemes were run for the upliftment of these classes, whereas the previous governments did not take any such concrete steps for the welfare of other backward classes

 isse aisa lagata he ki spain main abhi sanvaidhanik sankat bana hua he
 Payments will not be given to Catalonia cabinet members: Rajoy has now become the top decision-maker in the Northeast region, replacing Catalonia President Carles Puigdemont

 At the same time, there has been no immediate response from top officials of Catalonia
 haalanki barkhaast kiye gaye catelonia ke kshetreey police nideshak ne bayaan jari kiya he or kaha he ki vah nirdeshon kaa paalan karenge
 Spain's PM asked the Senate to dissolve the Catalonia parliament, earlier on Friday morning, Mariano Rajoy had asked for the dismissal of the officials of Senate Catalonia
 haalanki catelonia kii sansad kii ore se aazaadee kii ghoshnaa karne ke baad rajoy ne spain ke logon se shanti banaae rakhane ko kaha tha
 He had said that law and order in Catalonia will be rectified soon
 maaloom ho ki aarthik mandi or saarvajanik kharchon main katautee ke baad se catelonia kii aazaadee kii maang tej ho gai thi
 In 2015, the separatists had won the Catalonia separatists in the 2015 elections in Vadaspan
 is chunaav ke dauraan hi inhone catelonia ko aaazaad karaane ke liye janamat sangrah karaane kaa vaada kiya tha
 It was considered to be the biggest political crisis in Spain since recovering from dictatorship in 1977
 haalanki spain ke netritv ne is janamat sangrah ko khaarij kar diya tha
 On the other hand the courts had also asked to stop it
 is masale ko lekar spain police ne catelonia ke kai adhikariyon ko giraftaar bhi kii thi
 Now Mariano Rajoy has announced to hold elections on December 21, only after which the future of Catalonia will be decided
 yah he catelonia kaa itihashspain ke sabase samrudh ilaakon main shumaar catelonia kaa kareeb ek hajaar saal purana itihaas he
 It gained autonomy before the Civil War in Spain
 saal 1939 se 1975 ke bich general francisco franko ke netritv main catelonia kii is swaittata ko khatm kar diya gaya tha
 However, when Franco died, the demand for freedom of Catalonia began again
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki saal 1978 ke samvidhan main iske purvottar ilaakon ko phir se swaittata deni padi
 After this, in the year 2006, the powers of Catalonia were increased under an Act
 is bich catelonia kaa aarthik dabadabaa badha or vah ek raashtra ke rup main dekha jane laga
 However, it did not last long and the Spanish court withdrew all powers in 2010, which angered the Catalonia administration

 On Friday, two members of the government team formed for the presidential election, Rajnath Singh and Venkaiah Naidu met Congress President Sonia Gandhi at his residence at 10 Janpath
 25 minute chali is baithak main congress ke diggaj netaa gulam nabi aaazaad or mallikarjun khadge bhi shaamil rahe
 Actually, the government is trying to give this message, they have started an exercise to build consensus on their behalf on the presidential candidate
 das janpath se jab venkaiya naidu or rajnath singh ek hi gaadi main nikle, to rajnath singh ke chehre par rahasyamay muskaan is baat kaa sanket de rahi thi
 However, both of them appeared to avoid making any kind of statement
 sutron ke mutabik is baithak main sarkaar ne koi naam saamne nahin rakhaa he
 While discussing tea at 10, Janpath, Rajnath Singh told Sonia Gandhi that his party has not decided any name yet
 magar pradhanmantri ke videsh daure se pehle yani 24 june se pehle sarkaar naam final kar legi or uske baad vah vipakshi partiyon se samarthan maangegi
 Meaning the government will declare its presidential candidate and then expect the opposition parties to support it
 aise main is baat kii sambhaavnaaen ab zyada ban gai he ki vipaksh or satta paksh ke ummidavaar is chunaav main aamane-saamne honge
 The Congress believes that the government is merely pretending to hold such a meeting and in this situation, if the government declares its candidate from 23rd to 24th, then the Congress will have to discuss the candidate of the opposition parties before that
 ab 21 yaa 22 taarikh ko vipakshi netaaon kii baithak hone kii ummid he
 This possibility is also reinforced by the fact that Left leader Sitaram Yechury and RJD leader Lalu Prasad Yadav have made up their mind to oppose the government's candidature and they have said this publicly

 In the presidential election season, this meeting cannot be called just a courtesy call and its political significance is being extracted

 If aajtak-axis My India's estimate turns into results on May 23, it will not only be a defeat of the Grand Alliance, but will also put a question mark on the acceptability of Tejashwi Yadav, who is leading his biggest partner RJD
 aisa isliye bhi, kyonki yah pehla mauka tha jab yuva netaa tejasvi yadav ne apane pita va bihar kii raajnneeti main samose main aalu kii tarah jaruri samajhe jane vaale lalu yadav ke bina chunaav ladaa
 Lalu Yadav is in jail in the fodder scam case and he has not even got relief from the Supreme Court
 yahi vajah rahi ki is chunaav main lalu yadav prachaar se puri tarah gaayab rahe or tejasvi yadav ne kaman sanbhali
 Tejashwi with Lalu Yadav in the hospital during treatment (file photo) Following in his father's footsteps, Tejashwi Yadav definitely made social justice the most important issue and contested the BJP accusing BJP of being anti-dalit and poor
 iske alaava tejasvi ne congress samet duusare gaiyr-bijepi dalon ko bhi apane saath lekar chunaav ladaa, lekin tejasvi kii koi bhi tarkeeb kaam karti dikhaai nahin di
 Exit polls to date estimate that BJP-JDU-LJP alliance could win 38 seats out of the total 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar
 yani ek tarah se modi-nitish or ramvilas paswan kii tikdi ke saamne yuva tejasvi kaa netritv feekaa padataa najar aa rahaa he
 This is when Tejashwi and his mother Rabri Devi and sister Misa Bharti together raised the issue of sending Lalu Yadav to jail under a conspiracy
 iske alaava vidhansabha chunaav saath ladakar alag hone vaale nitish kumaar par janadesh kii chori karne kaa aarope bhi tejasvi yadav lagaate rahe, lekin agsit pole ke anumaan in tamaam rajnatik va bhaavnaatmak pahaluon ke asar ko feekaa bataa rahe hai
 That is, if the final results remain the same, then surely you can raise questions about the acceptability of RJD and Tejashwi Yadav
 varanasi main samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke kaaryakartaaon ne ek naare ko lekar shuru hue vivaad ke baad somvaar ko bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ke poster par kaali syaahi phenki
 The controversy has started with the slogan 'har-har Modi, ghar-ghar Modi'
 dharm guru or sthaneey buddhijivi ne bhagwaan shiv se modi kii tulana karne vaale is naare par aapatti jataai he
 The party has officially distanced itself from this slogan
 lekin sapa ke naaraaz kaaryakartaaon ne somvaar ko modi ke poster par kaali syaahi phenk di
 SP workers who took to the streets accused the BJP of comparing Modi with Mahadev (lord Shiva)

 yah poster elahabaad ke sabhi mahatvapurn sthanon par party netaa arun gupta ne chipka die hai
 The BJP also used this slogan in many places for campaigning, but the party removed it on Sunday after a growing controversy over it
 vipakshi partiyon ne modi kii tulana bhagwaan shiv se karne par bhaajapa kii aalochana kii he
 It is worth noting that Shankaracharya Swaroopanand spoke to Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat and raised his objection to this slogan, after which BJP said that it is not the official slogan of the party, but the official slogan of the party 'abki Bar, Modi government '
 modi ne bhi ravivaar ko twitor par kaaryakartaaon or samarthakon se is naare kaa istemaal na karne kii apil kii thi
