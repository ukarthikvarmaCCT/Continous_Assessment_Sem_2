 Gujarat has become a big challenge for BJP amidst this politics and movements
 - gujarat main patel or obisi ke bada varg donon main pichley teen saal se andolan chal rahaa he, jo bijepi ke voter rahe hai
 - bjp's real challenge is to get angry inside 12% Patel vote and 50% OBC vote
 - gujarat main bijepi kii dikkat ye bhi he ki narendra modi gujarat main sakriy nahin he, or gujarat netritv banta hua dikhataa rahaa he
 In Gujarat, especially with regard to GST, an atmosphere has been shown against BJP
 - jiesti ko lekar sarkaar ne chunaav se thik pehle kai riyaayaten di lekin inkaa kitna asar padegaa ye kahana mushkil he
 However, the Congress also has its challenges
 congress ke bade chehre rahe shankar singh waghela ne chunaav se kuch maheene pehle party chhod di
 There is still a big difference between the BJP and the Congress at the organization level

 white house ne america raashtrapati pad ke republican ummidavaar mit romany se unke us bayaan kaa spashtikaran maanga he jisamen unhone america niti ke khilaaf yerusalem ko israel kii rajdhani ke taur par samarthan diya he
 During his three-nation visit, Romney gave a speech in Jerusalem last Sunday
 is bhaashan main romany ne is shahar ko ‘israel kii rajdhani’ bataate hue iskaa samarthan kiya tha
 This Jewish country considers Israel as its capital but has not been accepted by the international community
 romany ke is bayaan ko filstini madhyasth saib irakaat ne turant hi ‘asweekaarya’ or ‘kshetra main america hiton ke liye nuksaandaayak’ bataate hue khaarij kar diya
 Only then did Romney again make controversial statements, then the White House, the office of US President Obama, asked him for clarification on his statements
 romany ne kaha tha ki israeli ‘samskruti’ ne desh kii aarthik tarakkee main yogadan diya he
 Irakat termed Romney's statement as 'racial'
 white house ke pravaktaa josh arnest ne romany ke is bayaan ke sandarbh main kaha, ‘jab aap duniya ke aise samvedansheel ilaake main jate hai to aapke bayanon kaa arth nikaalane ke liye unhen bahut kareeb se samajha or vishleshan kiya jaataa he

 ’ The Shiv Sena, which has been on a different path from the BJP for the last several days, has supported Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 haalanki is samarthan main ek hidaayat bhi di he
 Shiv Sena has supported PM Modi's statement that the Constitution is my scripture
 party ne kaha he ki bal thakare bhi aisa hi kehete the, modi ab usee maarg kaa anukaran kar rahe hai
 This instruction given to Modi, by writing an article in his mouthpiece Saamana, has said that if the constitution is a scripture, then the Prime Minister should expand his role and get the country out of the politics of religion
 yahpradhanmantri kii jimmedaarihe ki vah is dharmagranth ke mul vichaar ko hi vistaar pradaan kare
 Due to political instigation, the party has written that the unity of the country has come to a rift due to political instigation and play of politics in caste and religion

 Every question asked by the leaders of the Congress party about the claims of the leaders of the BJP was calling the Congress anti-national by calling it a question on the bravery of the ruling party
 is bich, congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne nunatam aay guarantee yojana kii ghoshnaa kar rashtrawaad banaam rashtradroh, modi banaam rahul kii puri bahes kaa rukh amir banaam garib par kendrit karne kii koshish kii he
 Now the Congress is calling the questions asked by the BJP leaders and Union Ministers as anti-poor
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne nyaay yojana kii ghoshnaa karte hue kaha ki agar pradhanmantri narendra modi hindustan ke sabase amir logon ko paisa de sakate hai, to congress party desh ke sabase garib logon ko paisa de sakati he
 In this sense, Rahul Gandhi's strategy is to show Prime Minister Narendra Modi standing with the rich and to tell the Congress party to be real friendly to the poor
 isaki ek baangi mangalvaar ko rajasthan ke sriganganagar main rahul gandhi kii raily main dikhi jahaan unhone kaha ki ham bainkon ke daravaaje chote dukandaaron, chote bijness waalon ke liye kholenge
 We will take away the key of the bank from Nirav Modi, Anil Ambani and give it to you (the poor)
 rajasthan sriganganagar main jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha ki hindustan ke 20 pratishat sabase garib logon ko congress party kii sarkaar har saal 72000 rupee bank khate main degi
 Meaning 3
 60 lakh karod rupee congress party 5 karod garib pariwaron ko dekar dikhaa degi
 Rahul said that the Congress Party had brought 14 crore people out of poverty, in the last 5 years Narendra Modi made them all poor again
 15 lakh nahin mili, 2 karod naukariyaan nahin milin, kisaanon kaa bhi karja maaf nahin hua; or jo aapane bachaakar ghar main rakhaa tha use bhi modi ji ne notebandi karke chin liya
 Poured the money of the poor into the pocket of the rich
 jawahar laal nehru uniwarsity main professor or arthshaastri arun kumaar kaa kahana he ki congress party kii yojana kitni kaamyaab hogi yah to lagu hone ke baad hi tay hoga
 But one thing is certain that this announcement has brought the debate of richness-poverty and inequality in the country to the center
 jiskaa parinaam behatar hi hoga
 Pro
 arun kumaar kaa kahana he ki haal main ek report ai thi jisamen bataaya gaya tha ki 9 sabase amir logon ke paas 55 fisadi velth he
 This shows the deep gap of inequality in the country that our country has 150 billionaires, which is more than Japan
 jabaki japan kii par capita inakam hamase 30 guna zyada he
 In fact, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has been calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi friendly for the rich and big industrialists for the last five years
 phir chaahe 'suut boot kii sarkaar' kaa tanj ho yaa notebandi ko 'fere and lavali' skim bataanaa ho
 Rahul Gandhi very carefully associated the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with fugitive economic offenders Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and Vijay Mallya
 bade udyogpatiyon se piem modi ke rishton kii baat har raily, har charchaa main rahul gandhi ke bayaan kaa mukhya centre rahaa
 So Rahul Gandhi got his biggest weapon from the alleged mess in Rafale plane deal
 jisamen france ke tatkaaleen raashtrapati francwa oland ke bayaan ne rahul gandhi ke hamale kii dhar ko or bhi painaa kiya
 In an interview to French magazine, François Hollande said that in the Rafael deal, it was said from India that Anil Ambani's company was made an offset partner
 rahul gandhi ne is bayaan kaa phayda uthaate hue pradhanmantri narendra modi par sidhaa aarope lagaaya ki apane kareebi anil ambani ko phayda dilaane ke liye upie sarkaar ke dauraan chal rahe samjhaute ko radd karte hue nayaa qaraar kiya
 Rahul Gandhi in his every rally, every address, referring to the Rafael deal, was also chanting 'chowkidar Chor Hai' and got it started
 'chaukeedaar chor he' ke naare ko counter karne ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 'main bhi chaukeedaar' abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii to sabhi kendriya mantriyon or bijepi samarthakon ne apane naam ke aage chaukeedaar laga liya
 This campaign of the Prime Minister was also a great success
 to congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ne apane uttar pradesh daure main kaha ki chaukeedaar to amiron ke hote hai, kisi ne garibon or kisaanon kii chaukeedaari karte dekha he
 Rahul Gandhi also said in the meeting of Sriganganagar, reiterating that Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, i am also the watchman, but did not tell whose watchman
 berozegaar yuvaaon ke, kisaanon ke yaa anil ambani ke? abhi loksabhaa chunaav kii shuruuaat bhar he, lekin raajnneetik sargarmi apane charam par he
 In which Congress President Rahul Gandhi is seen bringing poverty, unemployment to the center of political debate by announcing the justice scheme
 to duusari taraf pradhanmantri narendra modi ko chuninda amiron ke saath khadaa karte dikh rahe hai
 Now it has to be seen how the Congress can sustain the debate between the rich and poor two classes till the last phase of the general elections

 In this struggle, lakhs of people took part
 un swatantraaa senaniyon ne desh ke liye apana sab kuch nyochhavar kar diya
 Under Mahatma Gandhi's leadership, these great fighters could only be satisfied by achieving political independence
 lekin unhone pal bhar bhi aaraam nahin kiya
 Rather, with double enthusiasm, they engaged in the important task of framing the Constitution with full devotion
 unki najar main hamaara samvidhan, hamaare nae raashtra ke liye keval ek buniyadi kanoon hi nahin tha, balki saamaajik badlaav kaa ek dastavej tha
 The President said that the framers of our Constitution were very visionary
 ve ‘kanoon kaa shashan’ or ‘kanoon dwaara shashan’ ke mahatva or garima ko bhalee-bhaanti samajhate the
 He was a representative of an important phase of our national life
 ham saubhagyashaalee hai ki us daur ne hamen ganatantr ke rup main anmol viraasat di he
 The lessons learned from the period when our Constitution was formulated are relevant for us even today
 ham jo bhi kaary karen, jahaan bhi karen, or hamaare jo bhi lakshya hon
 The learning of that period is useful for us in every field
 unhone kaha ki raashtra nirmaan karodon chote-bade abhiyaanon ko jodakar bana, ek sampoorn abhiyaan he
 Building the character of citizens, laying the foundation of good values by families, and eradicating blind faith and inequality from society are all a contribution towards nation-building
 jahaan betiyon ko, beton kii hi tarah, shiksha, swasthya or aage badhane kii suvidhaayen di jaati hai, aise samaan avasaron vaale parivaar or samaaj hi ek khushhaal raashtra kaa nirmaan karte hai

 This is the ideal of fraternity or brotherhood
 hamen aazaadee ek kathin sangharsh ke baad mili thi
 In this struggle, lakhs of people took part
 un swatantraaa senaniyon ne desh ke liye apana sab kuch nyochhavar kar diya
 Under Mahatma Gandhi's leadership, these great fighters could only be satisfied by achieving political independence
 lekin unhone pal bhar bhi aaraam nahin kiya
 Rather, with double enthusiasm, they engaged in the important task of framing the Constitution with full devotion
 unki najar main hamaara samvidhan, hamaare nae raashtra ke liye keval ek buniyadi kanoon hi nahin tha, balki saamaajik badlaav kaa ek dastavej tha
 The President said that the framers of our Constitution were very visionary
 ve ‘kanoon kaa shashan’ or ‘kanoon dwaara shashan’ ke mahatva or garima ko bhalee-bhaanti samajhate the
 He was a representative of an important phase of our national life
 ham saubhagyashaalee hai ki us daur ne hamen ganatantr ke rup main anmol viraasat di he
 The lessons learned from the period when our Constitution was formulated are relevant for us even today
 ham jo bhi kaary karen, jahaan bhi karen, or hamaare jo bhi lakshya hon
 The learning of that period is useful for us in every field
 unhone kaha ki raashtra nirmaan karodon chote-bade abhiyaanon ko jodakar bana, ek sampoorn abhiyaan he
 Building the character of citizens, laying the foundation of good values by families, and eradicating blind faith and inequality from society are all a contribution towards nation-building
 jahaan betiyon ko, beton kii hi tarah, shiksha, swasthya or aage badhane kii suvidhaayen di jaati hai, aise samaan avasaron vaale parivaar or samaaj hi ek khushhaal raashtra kaa nirmaan karte hai
 The government can implement laws and make policies to provide justice to women, but such laws and policies will be effective only when family and society will listen to the voice of our daughters
 hamen parivartan kii is pukaar ko sunanaa hi hoga 
 President Kovind said that it is the self-confident and forward-thinking youth who build a self-confident and progressive nation
 hamaare 60 pratishat se adhik deshvasi 35 varsh se kam umr ke hai
 It is only on these that our expectations are guaranteed
 hamane sakshartaa ko kaaphi badhaayaa he; ab hamen shiksha ke daayre or badhaane honge
 Our aim should be to elevate the education system, and to expand its scope and to enable it to meet the challenges of 21st century digital economy, genomics, robotics and automation
 unhone kaha ki innovative bachche hi ek innovative raashtra kaa nirmaan karte hai
 To achieve this goal, we must gather together with a passion
 hamaari shiksha-pranali main, ratakar yaad karne or sunaane ke bajaay, bacchon ko sochane or tarah-tarah ke prayog karne ke liye protsaahit karnaa chahie
 We have increased food production significantly, but still the challenge of eliminating malnutrition and providing essential nutrients in the plate of each child remains
 yah hamaare bacchon ke shaareerik or maansik vikaas ke liye, or desh ke bhavishya ke liye, bahut hi mahatvapurn he
 President Kovind said that a vigilant nation is formed from the citizens who are vigilant at the level of the village and the city
 ham apane padosi ke nijee maamalon or adhikaron kaa sammaan karte hai

 The Prime Minister said that collective efforts are needed to determine health and hygiene in the submerged areas of Srinagar
 pradhanmantri ko jaankaree di gai ki doorsanchaar ke sampark behaal karne kii prakriya shuru ho gai he or srinagar main kareeb 8000 landline sakriy ho gai hai

 hindustan kii maujuuda aarthik susti ko lekar sabase pramukh afasana do lafjon main bayaan kiya ja saktaa haih bemauke faisle! thik us vakt jab vaishvik arthvyavastha 2010 se baari-baari se aane vaale apane sabase majboot daur main daakhil hui, hindustan ko ek ke baad ek nitigat faislon—notebandi, maal or seva kar kii shuruaati dikkaton or bainkon ke duubat karj ko nai shakl dene—ke dukhad nateezon main jhonk diya gaya
 These decisions demolished the domestic supply chain for some time
 inkaa asar feekaa padate hi vaishvik jowar hindustan ko uthaakar zyada oonchi vikaas dar par le jayega
 Meanwhile, reforms should continue to focus on easing the cost of doing business, while monetary and fiscal policies should provide short-term relief to ease the burden of adjustment
 lihaaja nitigat byaaj daron main katautee, kahin zyada kamjor mudra or maujuuda tathaa agle saal zyada rajkoshiya ghaataa bardaasht karnaa vakt kaa takaza he
 In view of the poor state of private investment, the policy of fiscal expansion should aim at increasing spending on infrastructure and subsidies for low and medium income housing
 magar jab chunaav munhabaae khadey hon, tab kisaanon ko bhi kuch sahaayta alag se di ja sakati he
 At first glance, this argument seems strong except that it has nothing to do with reality
 ab vaishvik vruddhi se shuruyaat karte hai
 The global economy has been witnessing all-round cyclical growth since the six months after 2016, with developed economies performing strongly in terms of both consumption and investment, while emerging economies have managed to rebound
 2018 main halaat or bhi behatar hone kii ummiden hai
 Both the euro zone and amorica will grow faster than trends
 is chakree oochaal kii tah main ek aisi vaishvik arthvyavastha he jo dhanchaagat dushwariyon main fansi he
 Measured productivity has declined almost everywhere since the economic crisis, when meaningful supply-supply or supply-related reforms have been missing
 yahaan tak ki america main jin kar sudhaaron kii itani shekhi baghaari gai, unase bhi madhyavadhi kii aapurti badaye bagaiyr kam samay ke liye maang main hi ijapha hone kii ummid kii ja sakati he
 After an eight-year expansion, with continued pressure on capacity and not increasing productivity as expected, salaries will eventually rise, pushing inflation further and forcing central banks to tighten further
 viksit arthvyavasthaaon se pare, saamaan kii vaishvik maang kaa akelaa doosraa strot china he
 In the recently concluded 19th Congress, the ruling Communist Party formally confessed that China is no longer a low-income economy, surrounded by the challenge of creating millions of jobs, but has become a growing middle-income country, Who is eager to make life better
 1981 main deng 'oping ne varg sangharsh kii jagah badhati aarthik vruddhi ko party ke pramukh uddeshy ke taur par pahachaanaa tha
 Then for the next three decades, provincial and lower-level officials put every effort to achieve high growth in every possible way, even if it suffered
 hindustan kii khaas vajahon kaa rukh karen, to vruddhi ke sust padane kii vajahon ke taur par notebandi or jiesti ke ulate asar or duubat karjon ko jimmedaar tehraaya jaataa rahaa he
 It cannot be denied that these decisions were in turmoil, perhaps more than they are now considered, but it is difficult to blame them completely
 vajah saaf haih desh kii vikaas dar main notebandi se chah maheene pehle or jiesti ke lagu hone se ek saal pehle 2016 kii duusari timahi se hi giravat dekhi gai he
 The problems of bad debts came into the limelight in 2016 and due to high lending, the health of banks had started to fall heavily since 2014
 to 2016 se vriddhidar main giravat kii kya vajah thi? yah tel ke daamon main aayaa badlaav tha, jinhone 2014-15 main vruddhi ko haanka tha
 After reaching the highest level in late 2013, worldwide oil prices fell nearly 70 per cent during 2014-15 and reached a low in the first quarter of 2016
 yah baari-bharkam giravat bharat ke liye joardaar sakaaratmak dhakka tha, jo takreeban puure 2014-15 ke dauraan growth ke raftaar pakadaaey kii vajah mana jaataa he
 Oil prices nearly doubled since the early months of 2016, which had a very bad impact and continued to slow growth
 notebandi, jiesti or duubat karjon ne to buree haalat ko bas or badtar hi kiya, unhone yah buree haalat paidaa nahin kii
 Apparently, some people will argue that the radical changes in politics during this period and the sentiments of the common people and the importance of changes in the decision making of the government is being told
 main aisa nahin kar rahaa hum
 i am merely saying that global oil prices affected the growth rate of India far more than any of these other reasons
 2018 main or uske aage ham kahaan ja sakate hai, yah jaanane ke liye hamen is baat ko zyada acchhee tarah samajhane kii jarurat he ki awwal to ham yahaan pahunche kaise
 Once we dismiss the improvisational and accidental arguments, then we move into a world of rude and intriguing answers, which are necessary to overcome long-standing misconceptions
 main aisi hi ek galat dharna se baat shuru karne ja rahaa hum
 Hindustan has been, and is, much more open to the global economy than it has been for a long time
 vishleshkon or niti-nirmaataaon ke bich vaaki ekarey he ki 2003-08 ke dauraan desh kii behad saraahi gai 9 fisadi kii vruddhi dar ke peeche nivesh main naatakeey badhotaree kii kaaphi bhoomika rahi thi
 Corporate investment increased from 5-6 per cent of GDP in the early 2000s to 17 per cent of GDP by 2008, thanks to the liberalization of 1991–92 and the accompanying structural reforms of companies in the late 1990s
 magar iske liye donon jimmedaar hai
 The increase in investment led to the production of many things, which some had to consume
 harek kone main shopping mal ke visphot ke baavjood yah gharelu khapat nahin thi jisane utpaadan main is badhotaree ko khapa liya, jaisaa ki aam taur par mana jaataa he
 Rather it was exports which grew at an astounding pace of about 18 per cent every year
 duusari taraf, nijee khapat 7
 Grew at a rate of 5 per cent, which was so much lower than the growth rate of the economy that its share in GDP fell from 62 per cent to 57 per cent
 ise or acchhee tarah samajhane kii garaj se, pichley kuch saalon ke dauraan giravat ke baavjood hindustan ke jidipi main niryaat kaa hissaa 20 fisadi he or yah indonesia ke baraabar or brazil se doguna he
 The most important reason behind the slowing trend in growth is attributed to the steady decline in investment, which has fallen from the highest level of 37 per cent of GDP in 2012 to below 30 per cent of GDP at present
 magar korporate nivesh to 2009 main hi ghota laga gaye the or tab se jidipi ke takreeban 12 fisadi se sapaat str par bane hue hai
 In turn, private investment in the housing and SME sector has fallen from 15 per cent of GDP to around 10 per cent in the last five years
 inkaa madhyam avadhi kii growth par behad ahm asar padaa
 Hindustan's 9 percent growth during 2003-08 was due to an 18 percent annual jump in exports
 pichley paanch saal main niryaat salanaa mahaj 3 fisadi kii dar se badha he
 Even if exports grow at double the rate in the coming years, it is difficult to see the overall growth going above 7 percent
 hindustan main nijee nivesh na to isliye ladkadaae kyonki funding kii laagat bahut zyada he or na hi isliye ki bank duubat karjon se laachaar hai or isliye bhi nahin ki vinimay dar bahut adhik he, jaisaa ki aaj samuhik vilaap kiya jaataa he
 They falter because the demand is not sufficient enough to justify large investments
 duusare lakrajon main, vaishvik growth ke girakar ausat par lautne kii sambhaavna ke saath, jab tak ham iconomi ke gharelu karkon ko itnaa paravaan chadhate nahin dekh pate ki korporate ko nivesh badhaane ke liye prerit kar saken, tab tak 7 fisadi hi nayaa 9 fisadi hoga
 It is easy to say, it is difficult to do, because it requires a fresh look at the mechanism which has been the foundation of policies and reforms since independence
 agar yaad karne kii jahamat uthaaen, to hindustan aapurti-baadhit arthvyavastha rahaa he jiske dhaanche main hi oonchi mahangaai dar or takalifdeh chaalu khate kaa ghaataa nihit tha
 Policies and reforms have been changed almost entirely to reduce supply bottlenecks in the entire economy: from spending on infrastructure to infusion of new capital into banks and through a network of financial pressures, regulatory shocks and public spending options Households were forced to keep increasing savings (for retirement income, children's education, health and building houses)
 nishpakshta ke saath kaha jaae, to jab tak desh main nirmit saamaan or sevaaon kii khapat ke liye videshi maang paryaapt thi, yah ekangi soch sahi thi
 Now this is no longer right
 mushkil pahalu alabatta is 70 saal puraane dhaanche par sawaal uthaanaa or isamen badlaav laana he or phir tamaam centre, rajya or sthaneey sarkaron ke bich is badlaav kii jarurat par aam raay bananaa he
 Rebuilding policies and reforms is less difficult and it is making the infrastructure of India more inward and less outward, enhancing public facilities of healthcare and education, forced savings for aging care Begins with ending financial pressures to improve lowering insurance rules and increase returns on retirement savings The expertise
 jahaan 1,800 dollar prati vyakti aamadani vaale kisi bhi mulk ne niryaat par nirbhar kiye bagaiyr oonchi vruddhi banaae rakhane main safalataa hasil nahin kii he, vahiin is baat kii bhi koi sambhaavna nahin he ki vaishvik vyapaar aarthik sankat se pehle kii vruddhi dar ke aasapaas bhi kahin laut sakegaa
 So the best option would be to shift the policy panes towards generating more domestic demand
 kya aisa hoga? keval ummid hi kii ja sakati he, kyonki 7 fisadi kii vruddhi dar kaaphi nahin bhi ho sakati haih agle 25 saal tak is raftaar se badhkar bhi hindustan kii prati vyakti aay main viksit deshon kii prati vyakti aay se mahaj takreeban 15 fisadi kaa or apane asian hamraah mulkon se iske aadhe kaa hi ijapha hoga

 Morgan is the Chief Emerging Markets Economist pradeep sharma ne aakhir shivasena ko hi kyon chunaa? is bare main sharma kaa kahana he ki divangat bal thakare unhen apane bete jaisaa maanate the
 Whenever there was any problem in the service, Saheb used to help
 90 ke dashak main jab mumbai main gangvaar charam par tha tab pradeep sharma, vijay salskar or dayaa nayak jaise police adhikariyon ne badmaashon ke encounter kar anderworld kaa khaatmaa karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi or surkhiyaan bhi batori thim
 But the 2006 Lakhan Bhaiya encounter became a bone in Pradeep Sharma's neck
 sharma ko jail janaa padaa tha
 However, he was later acquitted and returned to Khaki and sent the underworld kingpin Dawood Ibrahim's brother Iqbal Kaskar behind bars to clear old stains
 ab siyasat main shaamil hokar sharma netaa banane kii raah par chal pade hai
 It is reported that Shiv Sena may get Pradeep Sharma from Nalasopara to get a political encounter with Thakur family who ruled a parasol in Vasai Virar
 police kii naukari chhod siyasat kaa daaman thaamne vaale pradeep sharma ne bandook chhod ab dhanush-baan tham liya he
 Previously, there were goons on their target, now they will be opposition leaders
 film padmavati kaa vivaad abhi thama nahin he ki ek or film vivaadon ke ghere main aa gai he
 The film is on the backdrop of the Babri Holocaust in Ayodhya
 relies se pehle film ke nirdeshak ko dhamkiyaan di ja rahi hai
 Filmmaker Sunil Singh's debut film 'the Game of Ayodhya' is releasing on December 8
 is film ko sibiefasi ne khaarij kar diya tha, lekin baad main apilit tribunel ne ise paas kiya
 The film is related to the Babri demolition in Ayodhya on 6 December 1992
 nirdeshak ke anusaar, ye ek premakatha he
 He says that he has shown only the truth in it
 padmavati par dhai ghante chali meeting: kai sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin de paae bhansaali, 2 hafte kaa samayfilm main babari vidhwans, purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi, purv grahamantri laalkrishna adwani or upi ke purv mukhyamantri kalyaan singh ke original footage istemaal kiye gaye hai
 Controversy has started on this film before its release
 media reports ke anusaar, aligarh ke abivipi kaaryakarta bataae ja rahe amit goswami ne ghoshnaa kii he ki yadi koi sunil singh kii baanh katkar laata he to ve ek lakh rupye inam denge
 Amit Goswami has told an English newspaper, 'if the film releases in theaters and there is an incident, the administration and government will be responsible for it
 mujhe nirdeshak kahin dikhaai dete hai to main unhen maar duungaa
 They hurt our feelings
 in dhamkiyon ke bare main sunil ne kaha he, 'maine report padhi he, koi meraa sir kaatna chahta he to koi baanh
 Filmmakers are easily targeted
 log paanch minute ko femes hone ke liye aisa karte hai
 Central government should ban Padmavati, otherwise they will do that history will remember: UP Police has alerted all the district chiefs in view of Togadiyam Dhamki and fears of controversy
 film kii relies par vivaad na ho, iske liye prashasan satark he
 Let the director know in the first interview that he wants to show his films Lal Krishna Advani and Mulayam Singh
 isamen kuch aapattijanak nahin he
 Those who want to suppress the truth are attacking them
 is film main pati-patni ke bich prem ko darshaya he, saath hi ye bhi bataane kii koshish he ki auraten kis tarah sapanom kii duniya yaa apane aas-pados ke logon ko dekh kar khud ko bhi oonchai par pahunchane kii chaah rakhti hai
 The author's compulsions also show how the sometimes talented writer struggles to get his book printed, or how the publishers seek to spoil his well-written story
 tippaniyan Another thing was told in the film 'paper's Fools', why should you consider yourself weak by looking at others
 jo apane se kamazor yaa garib hai unhen dekhakar ye kyon na samajha jaae ki hamaare paas kitna kuch he
 The theme of this film sounds good but the script is weak
 nirdeshak anil kumaar choudhary ne film ko halaki-phulki rakhane ke liye thode hansi-mazaaq bhare seen daale hai phir bhi ye film baari or khinchi hui lagati he
 Mugdha Godse Punjabi speaking does not look good as well as the production value of the film also seems weak
 mere najariye se achche vishay ko lekar ek kamazor script likhi gai he
 Hence the film 2 stars from my side
 film 'kagaz ke fools' main ek or baat bataai gai ki dusron ko dekhakar apane aapako kamazor kyon samajha jaae
 For those who are weaker or poorer than themselves, why not understand how much we have
 is film kaa vishay acha lagata he magar script kamazor he
 Director Anil Kumar Chaudhary has given a few laugh-out-loud scenes to keep the film light-hearted, yet the film feels heavy and drawn
 mugdha godse punjabi bolti hui acchhee nahin lagati saath hi film kaa production vailu bhi kamazor dikhaai padataa he
 From my point of view, a weak script has been written about a good subject
 isliye film ko meri taraf se 2 star

 ) Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has now played another big bet
 unhone do kendriya mantriyon or reliance samooh ke chairman mukesh ambani ke khilaaf faujadarimukadmaa daayar karne kaa aadeshdia he
 He alleges that there has been dishonesty in fixing the prices of natural gas (natural gas) and for this two ministers Murali Deora and Veerappa Moily and Mukesh Ambani are responsible
 unhone yah aarope bhi lagaaya ki desh main gas kii koi kami nahin he or vyaktigat hiton ko phayda pahunchane ke liye gas kii keemten 4 dollar se badhaakar 8 dollar tay kii gai hai or yah april se lagu hongi jisase desh main mahangaai badhegi
 This will benefit Reliance by Rs 54,000 crore
 ab yah maamla bhrashtachar kaa he yaa nahin, yah to kisi nishpaksh jaanch se pataa chalegaa
 Arvind Kejriwal also has a point that it will increase inflation in the country
 lekin sawaal kai or hai
 The big question is, what did Arvind Kejriwal do when the process of fixing gas prices was going on? Of course he was not the CM at that time but he was an activist
 usase bhi bada sawaal he ki aakhir dilli kii tamaam samasyaon ko chhodkar vah ek bade rashtriya vishay par kyon ja tike? yah vishay dilli ke liye mahatvapurn he or ise bhi unhen uthaane kaa puraa haq he lekin baaki muddon kaa kya hoga? iske alaava ek prashasnic sawaal bhi uthta he ki kya dilli sarkaar ko kisi kendriya mantri par mukadmaa daayar karne kaa aadesh dene kaa haq he? agar aise muddon par rajya sarkarein jaanch karne lageen or mukademen daayar karne kaa aadesh dene lageen to desh main kya hoga?samvidhan ke mutabik kendra sarkaar ko usase sambandhit maamalon main faisla karne kaa adhikaar he or usne desh main utpaadit gas kii keemten badhaane kaa faisla kiya
 Now a state government can raise a finger on such decisions, but can not file a lawsuit, calling it a case of corruption
 jaahir he kejariwal ne is maamle kii najaakat ko samaj kar ek bada daanv khelaa he taaki logon kii sahanubhuti unke saath rahe or unki ghatati lokapriyata ko sahaara bhi mili
 Actually, he wants to remain in his activist form
 yah unke vyaktitv kaa hissaa he or yahi unhen prerana detaa he
 The point is clear
 kejariwal ne ek bada daanv chal diya he
 He is also trying to save his credibility and divert a little attention

 According to the police, Nisha was married to Kanhaiya Sahu 9 years ago
 shaadi ke baad sasuraal vaale use dahej ke pareshaan karte the
 In 2017, in-laws expelled Nisha from her house demanding dowry

 Nisha went to her in-laws to protest her husband's illicit relationship
 pati ko yah baat nagavar gujri
 He beat Nisha fiercely

 Today will be a big day not only in the politics of UP but also in the politics of the country, for the first time, BSP supremo Mayawati and SP Chief Akhilesh Yadav are starting the election campaign together
 ek arase baad basapa or sapa ne haath milaayaa or manch bhi saajha kiya lekin ab tak sanyukt jansabha ko sambodhit nahin kiya tha
 There are only a few days left for the first phase of elections, and just before that the election of these two leaders will be held
 in netaaon kii pehali sanyukt chunavi sabha ravivaar ko devband saharanpur main hogi, jahaan pehle charan main chunaav hona he
 The two teams are coming together again after the 90s
 ek vakt jab upi main mandir-masjid vivaad ke kaaran dhruvikaran apane charam par tha us vakt bijepi ko satta se dur karne ke liye sapa ne apni dhuravirohi basapa se gathbandhan kiya
 When the state assembly elections were held in 1993, the SP got 110 seats and the BSP got 67 seats
 chunaav main kisi bhi party ko bahumat nahin mila tha
 Mulayam Singh Yadav then formed the government with the BSP and some other parties
 basapa baahar se sarkaar kaa samarthan kar rahi thi lekin 2 saal baad hi yani 1995 main gathbandhan tut gaya
 That era was of Mulayam and Kanshi Ram but after so many years now Mayawati and Akhilesh are together
 haalanki is baar bhi saamne bijepi hi he
 Everyone's eye on the rally, everyone's eyes will remain on this rally, how do these two leaders give the message of their workers coming together
 kyonki kuch hi samay pehle tak donon hi dalon ke netaa or kaaryakarta ek duusare ko dekhnaa tak pasand nahin karte the
 In such a situation, it will be a matter of seeing what he says in the election public meeting for the first time
 donon dalon ke saamne sabase badi chunauti voton ke transfar kii bhi he
 BJP is also eyeing this rally
 basapa or sapa ke saath hi ralod bhi sanyukt raily main shaamil he
 With this joint rally, the election tour of the leaders of the grand alliance will begin
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki aisi 10 se zyada saajha reliyaan hongi

 BJP had captured all these seats in the Modi wave last time
 areldi pramukh ajit singh bhi chunaav haar gaye the
 The BJP won all these eight seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki, baad main 2018 main kairana loksabhaa seat par hue chunaav main basapa or sapa ke samarthan se areldi ne bijepi se ye seat chin lee thi

 com / ayab4oqq8h Ratan Tata, the outgoing chairman of the Tata group that has ever started a civil aviation service in India, on Sunday indicated that his group is unlikely to step into the sector again as the 'destructive competition' in the region is at home
 tata samooh kii ore se 1990 ke dashak ke madhya main bharat main singapore international airlines (esae) ke saath mil kar airline shuru karne ke prastaav ko yaad karte hue tata ne kaha, ‘us samay kii tulana main aaj yah kshetra puri tarah alag he
 "it has become a lot like the telecom sector," Tata said
 isamen compananiyon kii baadh aa gayi or inamen se kuch oparator vittiya sankat main hai
 Today, i would hesitate to step into this field, because there is a possibility that you will have to face a lot of competition in this which will be unhealthy competition
 ’ yah puche jane par ki kya vah ‘galaa kaat’ pratispardhaa ko lekar chintit hai, to tata ne iskaa na main jawaab diya par kaha, ‘galakat pratispardhaa aapako baahar rakhane ke liye ho to vah vinaashkari pratispardhaa he
 'he said,' People or companies abroad go bankrupt
 yahaan ve aisa nahin karte, badahaal hone ke baavjood ve parichaalan karte rahete hai
 After that they are operating to eliminate you
 ’ intervyuu ke dauraan tata se jab yah poocha gaya ki kya yah sahi he ki kisi ne tata-singapore airline ke prastaav ko manjuur karne ke liye unase 15 karod rupee kii rishwat kii maang kii thi
 To this, Tata said that this story is true, but the then civil aviation minister did not ask for this amount directly from him
 tata ne kaha, ‘ek kaarobaari ne mujhase kaha tha ki aap paisa kyon nahin de dete hai
 This is what the Minister wants
 "to what he replied to the businessman, Tata said," i told him that you don't understand
 ham is tarah kaa kaam nahin karte hai
 He told me that if you want to start an airline, you have to pay
 aap jaanate hai ki mantri yah chaahate hai
 
 15 karod rupee
 Tata said that after becoming chairman of the group in 1991, he had made a strategic plan
 iske tahat unki nigaah vimaanan tathaa raksha jaise nae kshetron par thi jinamein nijee kshetra bade tareeke se pravesh kar saktaa he
 He said, 'the fact that we were subjected to many restrictions for many years and technology could not be found was a big challenge in itself
 ’ lekin yah chunauti desh ke nijee kshetra ke saamne kabhi nahin rakhi gayi jo ‘mere liye kuch niraashaa kii baat he
 Tata said that the selfish elements inherent in public sector and government laboratories do not want private companies to enter these areas
 unhone kaha ki yahi vajah he ki aaj in kshetron ko khol to diya gaya par ab bhi inamen nijee kshetra kii bhagidaari kaaphi simit he

 police hamaare niyantran main nahin ho sakati he lekin unamem kam se kam maanavtaa to honi chahie

 ' somvaar ko janata dal (united) dwaara yojit ek kaarykram main bolte hue mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne na keval doharaaya ki kanoon ke rajya main kisi prakaar kii kami yaa kamajori nahin dikhaai padagi balki saath main yah bhi kaha ki mahagathbandhan dharm nibhaane main unki taraf se kabhi koi kami nahin hogi
 People are making their own interpretation of Nitish's statement regarding the state and grand alliance of law
 mahagathbandhan ke bare main bolte hue nitish kumaar ne daawa kiya ki mahagathbandhan ke dalon or unke sheersh netritv ke saath ke saath vichaar-vimarsh ke baad nirnay liye jate hai
 Nitish's claim is perhaps being considered a defense to the speculations being made about the prohibition of liquor in the state as Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) President Lalu Yadav is not only told against liquor ban but in private conversations he has repeatedly told the media In the discussion of the matter, he said that he had no knowledge in this regard, especially on the ban on foreign liquor
 haalanki lalu yadav ne saarvajanik rup se is kadam kaa bhi swaagat kiya he
 Regarding the grand alliance, Nitish said that the party which has the right to take care of them and claimed that there will never be any shortfall from their side
 hameshaa nitigat faisle ke pehle wo nitigat saajhedaari bhi karte hai
 But when speaking on this statement from his party's forum, political experts believe that Nitish has resented the last days of Lalu Yadav's statement of his party's former MP Muhammad Shahabuddin in which he had described Nitish as the leader of the situation
 The reason is being given nitish jaanate hai ki lalu yadav is mudde par bol sakate the lekin maun rahakar unhone apane samarthako main sandesh bheja he ki unki maun sahmati shahabuddin ke bayaan par he
 The comments lekin jahaan nitish ne naaraazgi dikhaai vahiin kanoon vyavastha par apana rukh saaf kar unhone apane sahyogiyon khaskar lalu yadav or shahabuddin jaise unke samarthakon ko bhi sandesh diya he ki ab unase koi narmi kii apeksha karnaa bekaar he or aane vaale dinon main shaayad unki sarkaar aapraadhik chhavi ke logon ko jail or sajaa dilaane main zyada dilchaspee or mustaidi dikhaaegi
 The state government is assuming that whatever the verdict comes in the Supreme Court, but the responsibility on the state government will increase further that the pending cases against people of criminal image like Shahabuddin should be cleared at the earliest
 haalanki rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ne abhi tak koi pratikriya nahin di he lekin party ke netaa maanate hai ki shahabuddin ke mudde par maun rahanaa lalu yadav kii majaburi he lekin wo bhi maanate hai ki lalu yadav ek bayaan se shahabuddin ke bayaan se shuru hue vivaad par viraam laga sakate the lekin apni nijee majaburi ke kaaran wo mauka unhone jane diya
 At the same time, the Congress party has stood with Nitish on this issue and has expressed that he is not with Lalu Yadav on this issue
 mahagathbandhan ke bare main bolte hue nitish kumaar ne daawa kiya ki mahagathbandhan ke dalon or unke sheersh netritv ke saath ke saath vichaar-vimarsh ke baad nirnay liye jate hai

 At the same time, the Congress party has stood with Nitish on this issue and has expressed that he is not with Lalu Yadav on this issue
 vahiin mahagathbandhan ke bare main nitish ne kaha ki jis dal kaa jitna adhikaar hota he, wo unka khyaal rakhte hai or daawa kiya ki unki taraf se kabhi koi kami nahin aegi
 They always have a strategic partnership even before the policy decision
 lekin is bayaan kaa apane party ke forum se bolne par rajnatik jaankaar maanate hai ki nitish ne pichley dinon lalu yadav dwaara apane party ke purv saansad mohammad shahabuddin ke us bayaan kaa jisamen unhone nitish ko paristhitiyon kaa netaa bataaya tha, par maun rahanaa unki naaraazgi kaa kaaran bataaya ja rahaa he
 Nitish knows that Lalu Yadav could have spoken on this issue but silently he has sent a message to his supporters that his silence is on the statement of Shahabuddin
 tippaniyan But while Nitish showed his displeasure, he clarified his stand on the law and order and has also sent a message to his colleagues, especially his supporters like Lalu Yadav and Shahabuddin, that it is useless to expect any leniency from them now and in the coming days, perhaps their government's criminal image Will show more interest and promptness in getting jail and punishment to the people of
 rajya sarkaar maan kar chal rahi he ki sarvocch nyaayalay main faisla chaahe jo bhi aae lekin rajya sarkaar ke upar jimmedaari is baat ko lekar or badhegi ki shahabuddin jaise aapraadhik chhavi ke logon ke khilaaf lambit maamalon ko jald se jald khatm kiya jaye
 Though the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) has not yet responded but the party leaders believe that keeping silence on Shahabuddin's issue is Lalu Yadav's compulsion but he also believes that Lalu Yadav started with a statement from Shahabuddin's statement He could have stopped the dispute but due to his personal compulsion he let that chance go
 vahiin congress party ne is mudde par nitish ke saath khadaa hokar ye jataa diya he ki wo is mudde par lalu yadav ke saath nahin hai

 supreme court ne rashtriya gaan, yani 'jan gana man' ko cinemagharon main bajaanaa anivaary kar diya he
 This decision came yesterday
 haalanki cinemagharon main film pradarshan se pehle raashtragan bajaane kii parampara purv main bhi rahi he
 It is mentioned in the book 'rajneetnama Madhya Pradesh' by Deepak Tiwari, a senior journalist of Madhya Pradesh
 saath ke dashak main jab bharat or china ke bich yuddh hua tab tatkaaleen congress sarkaar ne dwarka prasad mishra kii salaah par cinemagharon main desh kii janata main deshbhakti kaa jajba jagaane ke liye raashtragan bajaanaa anivaary kiya tha
 Dwarka Prasad Mishra has been the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh
 isse pehle ve sagar vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati the
 Deepak Tiwari has written in 'politics Nama Madhya Pradesh' that Dwarka Prasad Mishra settled in Jabalpur in April 1962 after completion of the tenure of Vice Chancellor at Sagar University
 ve congress ke netaaon ke sampark main the or pandit jawaharlal nehru se bhi unki najdiki thi
 In those days india-china war took place
 tab indira gandhi kii adhyakshata main china hamale ke viruddh kendriya naagarik parishad banaai gai
 Dwarka Prasad Mishra was made the chairman of the Public Relations Committee
 mishra kii salaah par cinemagharon main film pradarshan se pehle raashtragan bajaane kaa chalan shuru kiya gaya tha
 Deepak Tiwari told NDTV that China's attack was a time of great calamity on the country
 un dinon main aam jan main desh ke prati samarpan kaa bhav jaagrit karne kii jarurat thi
 The Central Civil Council was formed with this objective
 cinemaghar vah sthaan he jahaan aam log niyamit rup se ekatrit hote hai
 Dwarka Prasad Mishra found cinema halls most suitable for conveying patriotism to the masses and advised the government to play the national anthem at these places
 gauratlab he ki supreme court ne ek ahm aadesh main buudhvaar ko kaha ki deshbhar ke sabhi cinemagharon main film shuru hone se pehle rashtriya gaan zarur bajegaa
 The Supreme Court also said that while playing the national anthem, it would also be mandatory to show the national flag on the screen of the cinema hall, and all those present in the cinema hall would have to stand in honor of the national anthem
 supreme court ne kaha ki rashtriya gaan rashtriya pahchaan, rashtriya ekta or sanvaidhanik deshbhakti se judaa he
 As per the court order, care should be taken that the national anthem should not be used in any commercial interest
 kisi bhi tarah kii gatividhi main drama creat karne ke liye bhi rashtriya gaan kaa istemaal nahin hoga tathaa rashtriya gaan ko vairieti song ke taur par bhi nahin gaaya jayega
 After all, why did this person petition the cinema hall to stand on the national anthem
 
 
 tippaniyan Shyam Narayan Choukse's plea in this case said that the practice of the national anthem should be banned for any commercial activity, and that the national anthem should not be used to create drama in entertainment shows
 yachika main yah bhi kaha gaya tha ki ek baar shuru hone par rashtriya gaan ko ant tak gaaya janaa chahie, or bich main band nahin kiya janaa chahie
 The petition also urged the court to order that the national anthem should not be sung among people who do not understand it
 iske atirikt rashtriya gaan kii dhun badalakar kisi ore tareeke se gane kii ijaajat nahin milani chahie
 The petition said that in such cases, the national anthem is in violation of the rules and it is against the 1971 law
 isse pehle, supreme court ne is yachika par sunwaayee karte hue oktober main centre sarkaar ko notice jari kar jawaab maanga tha

 cinemaghar vah sthaan he jahaan aam log niyamit rup se ekatrit hote hai
 Dwarka Prasad Mishra found cinema halls most suitable for conveying patriotism to the masses and advised the government to play the national anthem at these places
 gauratlab he ki supreme court ne ek ahm aadesh main buudhvaar ko kaha ki deshbhar ke sabhi cinemagharon main film shuru hone se pehle rashtriya gaan zarur bajegaa
 The Supreme Court also said that while playing the national anthem, it would also be mandatory to show the national flag on the screen of the cinema hall, and all those present in the cinema hall would have to stand in honor of the national anthem
 supreme court ne kaha ki rashtriya gaan rashtriya pahchaan, rashtriya ekta or sanvaidhanik deshbhakti se judaa he
 As per the court order, care should be taken that the national anthem should not be used in any commercial interest
 kisi bhi tarah kii gatividhi main drama creat karne ke liye bhi rashtriya gaan kaa istemaal nahin hoga tathaa rashtriya gaan ko vairieti song ke taur par bhi nahin gaaya jayega
 After all, why did this person petition the cinema hall to stand on the national anthem
 
 
 tippaniyan Shyam Narayan Choukse's plea in this case said that the practice of the national anthem should be banned for any commercial activity, and that the national anthem should not be used to create drama in entertainment shows
 yachika main yah bhi kaha gaya tha ki ek baar shuru hone par rashtriya gaan ko ant tak gaaya janaa chahie, or bich main band nahin kiya janaa chahie
 The petition also urged the court to order that the national anthem should not be sung among people who do not understand it
 iske atirikt rashtriya gaan kii dhun badalakar kisi ore tareeke se gane kii ijaajat nahin milani chahie
 The petition said that in such cases, the national anthem is in violation of the rules and it is against the 1971 law
 isse pehle, supreme court ne is yachika par sunwaayee karte hue oktober main centre sarkaar ko notice jari kar jawaab maanga tha
 Significantly, the Supreme Court said in an important order on Wednesday that the national anthem will be played before the film starts in all theaters across the country
 supreme court ne yah bhi kaha ki rashtriya gaan bajte samay cinemahol ke parde par rashtriya dhvaj dikhaaya janaa bhi anivaary hoga, tathaa cinemaghar main maujuud sabhi logon ko rashtriya gaan ke sammaan main khadaa hona hoga
 The Supreme Court held that the national anthem is associated with national identity, national unity and constitutional patriotism
 court ke aadesh ke mutabik, dhyaan rakhaa jaae ki kisi bhi vyavsaayik hit main rashtriya gaan kaa istemaal nahin kiya jaae
 The national anthem will not be used to create drama in any kind of activity and the national anthem will not be sung as Variety Song either
 aakhir kyon is shaks ne cinema haul main raashtragan par khadey hone kii yachika darj kii
 
 
 The comments is maamle main shyaam narayan chaukase kii yachika main kaha gaya tha ki kisi bhi vyavsaayik gatividhi ke liye rashtriya gaan ke chalan par roak lagaai jaani chahie, or antertenment sho main drama creat karne ke liye rashtriya gaan ko istemaal na kiya jaae
 The petition also stated that once started the national anthem should be sung to the end, and not stopped in between
 yachika main court se yah aadesh dene kaa aagrah bhi kiya gaya tha ki rashtriya gaan ko aise logon ke bich na gaaya jaae, jo ise nahin samajhate
 In addition, changing the tune of the national anthem should not allow singing in any other way
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki is tarah ke maamalon main rashtriya gaan niyamon kaa ulanghan he or yah varsh 1971 ke kanoon ke khilaaf he
 Earlier, the Supreme Court, hearing this petition, issued a notice to the Central Government in October seeking an answer

 The Supreme Court on Thursday asked Muslim bodies how the practice of triple talaq can be a matter of 'faith' when they are saying that it is 'patriarchal', 'wrong according to theology' and 'sin'
 pradhan nyaayadhish jees khehar kii adhyakshata vaali paanch nyaayadhishon kii samvidhan peeth ne muslimon main prachlit teen talaak kii pratha kii sanvaidhanik vaidhata ko chunauti dene vaali yachikaaon par centre, ol india muslim personal lau board, ol india muslim vuman personal lau board or vibhinn anya pakshon kii daleelon ko greeshmavkash ke dauraan chah din tak sunne ke baad faisla surakshit rakh liya
 The court noted the repeated pleas of AIMPLB and former Union Minister and Senior Advocate Salman Khurshid that the triple talaq is not mentioned in the Holy Quran but was 'sin', 'irregular', 'patriarchal', 'wrong according to theology' 'and' undesirable ', but the court should test it
 khurshid nijee haisiyat se maamle main adaalat kii sahaayta kar rahe hai
 The bench said, "you (khurshid) say that it is a sin
 kaise koi paapi pratha aasthaa kaa vishay ho saktaa he
 Has this (three divorces) been going on continuously for 1400 years
 jawaab he 'haa
 'is it going on all over the world
 jawaab he 'nahin
 'the system itself says that it is bad and wrong
 " peeth main nyaayamurti courian joseph, nyaayamurti aar epa nariman, nyaayamurti you you lalit or nyaayamurti abdul nazeer bhi shaamil hai
 The comments ye tippanee tab kii gai jab khurshid pratyuttar par daleelein rakh rahe the
 He emphasized that this practice is a sin and theologically wrong, this law cannot be right
 haalanki, unhone daleel rakhi ki adaalat ko iskaa pareekshan nahin karnaa chahie
 The bench said, "therefore, what is wrong in law cannot be part of the practice
 agar yah dharamshastra main galat he to ise kanuunan sweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa jo naitik rup se galat ho, vah kanuunan sahi nahin ho saktaa
 One who is not completely ethical cannot be lawful

 AIMPLB stated that it is a sin and patriarchal practice and said that it cannot be an integral part of Islam
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) adaalat ne empielbi or purv kendriya mantri or varisht adhivaktaa salmaan khurshid kii baar-baar kii daleelon par gaur kiya ki teen talaak kaa pavitra quran main ullekh nahin he balki yah 'paap', 'aniyamit', 'pitrusattatmak', 'dharamshastra ke anusaar galat' or 'avaanchhneeya' he, lekin adaalat ko iskaa pareekshan karnaa chahie
 Khurshid, in his personal capacity, is assisting the court in the case
 peeth ne kaha, "aap (khurshid) kehete hai ki yah paap he
 How any sinful practice can be a matter of faith
 kya yah (teen talaak) lagaataar 1400 vashren se chal rahaa he
 The answer is 'yes'
 ' kya yah puri duniya main chal rahaa he
 The answer is 'no'
 ' vyavastha khud hi kahati he ki yah kharaab or galat he
 "the bench also consists of Justice Kurian Joseph, Justice RF Nariman, Justice u u Lalit and Justice Abdul Nazir
 tippaniyan These remarks were made when Khurshid was arguing the response
 unhone jor diya ki yah pratha paap he or dharamshastra ke anusaar galat he, yah kanuunan sahi nahin ho saktaa
 However, he argued that the court should not examine it
 peeth ne kaha, "isliye, jo kanuunan galat he vah pratha kaa hissaa nahin ho saktaa
 If it is wrong in theology, it cannot be legally accepted as morally wrong, it cannot be legally correct
 jo puri tarah naitik nahin he, vah kanoon sammat nahin ho saktaa
 "on behalf of Saira Banu, one of the three divorce victims, Senior Advocate Amit Singh Chadha began to argue for rebuttal, citing aimplb's stand
 empielbi ne kaha ki yah paap or pitrusattatmak pratha he or kaha ki yah islam kaa abhinn hissaa nahin ho saktaa

 On the eve of the core committee meeting, Kumar Vishwas wrote a letter to Hazare in this regard and said that the leaders of the ruling party were targeting Hazare and trying to tarnish his public image and credibility

 The advice of the state and central government was openly flouted
 itnaa hi nahin, chaatraon ke jaij andolan ko kalankit karne ke liye biechayu prashasan ne jhooth or fareb kaa bhi sahaara liya
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath did not even listen to the matter, according to information received from sources, on September 22, a day before the police lathicharge, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath personally spoke to Vice Chancellor Girish Chandra Tripathi personally and he got to meet the students and their grievances
 He was instructed to resolve, but the Vice Chancellor did not list them
 lihaaja chaatraon par police lathicharge karne jaisi ghatnaayen huin
 Top officials of the PMO had also given advice that according to the advisories, on September 22, when the Prime Minister was visiting Benares, the top officials of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) also asked the Vice Chancellor to resolve the matter as soon as possible

 maamle main kulapati ko na sirf barkhaast kiya janaa chahie, balki unke khilaaf aapraadhik cese bhi darj kiya janaa chahie
 Congress leader said - Why did the PM not explain to the Vice Chancellor, if the Vice Chancellor goes to meet the girl students, if they hear their complaint, then what would have happened to them
 par vah ahankaar main duube hue the
 He asked why the Prime Minister did not explain it to him? If the Prime Minister himself wanted to worship Durga in the temple, he could also meet the Durga (girls) sitting on the road, but he did not do so and changed his path

 a new book claimed that officials of the Pakistani intelligence agency Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) were not only aware of the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden living in Abbottabad, but he also assisted the then al-qaeda chief and now the top leader of this terrorist organization Ayman Al Zawahiri was also provided complete security and safe havens to live
 kitaab ‘sil torget jeronimo’ main kaha gaya he ki iesai adhikari samay samay par laden kii jaanch bhi karte the
 This book, which made sensational revelations, was written by Chuck Farrer, former commandos of Seals

 Farrer wrote in his book, 'ISI knew very well where Laden was
 vah use puri tarah samarthan bhi detii rahi
 This book, totaling 225 pages, has been published by St
 Martin's Press, New York

 Describing Jawahiri as a clever and clever person, Farrer said that he came under the protection of ISI after the demolition
 kitaab main likhaa gaya he, ‘tora bora main sankat ke baad jawahiri ko yah sabit karne kii jarurat padi ki alqaida ab bhi sakriy he jabaki uske do amir chhipe hue the
 Many prominent al Qaeda leaders were killed in US drone strikes and special operations

 5 karod dollars kaa inaam rakhaa he
 Zawahiri trusted no one and soon left for Pakistan
