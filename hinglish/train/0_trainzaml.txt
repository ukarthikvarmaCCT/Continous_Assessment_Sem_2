 "28-year-old AAP worker Gopal Mohan said very politely that the current Lokayukta has no authority
 kejariwal jaldi hi is baatcheet se ukta gaye or rithala (uttar-pashchim) main apni agali chunavi sabha ke liye ravaanaa ho gaye
 a day later Kejriwal tweeted, "sheelaji called my publicity manager Gopal in New Delhi constituency yesterday

 He says the results are surprising
 jab team kejariwal ne 26 november, 2012 ko anna hajaare se alag hokar aam aadmi party kii shuruyaat kii thi to unka safar bahut lanbaa lag rahaa tha
 According to Yadav, the AAP party considered this pillar of bsp's mentor Kanshi Ram as a pioneer for his future, "to lose the first election

 To win the third
 ’’lekin aktubar ke shuru main dilli ke sisero associats ne aap ke liye jo surveykshan kiya usamen party kaa vot share 32 pratishat bataaya gaya, jo congress ke mukaable 3 pratishat zyada he

 He says, "the truth has started coming to us that we should be called to form the next government in Delhi
" ’’ ve maanate hai ki bogus vot yaa sharaab or dhan ke laalach main pade vot surveykshan main shaamil nahin hote kyonki unhen ‘‘aank’’ paanaa sambhav nahin he
 a month before the AAP survey, AAP was placed third in the India today-sea Voters' Country survey after the Congress and BJP
 tab bhi is surveykshan main kejariwal ko doosraa sabase popular mukhyamantri bataaya ja rahaa tha, jisase pataa lagata he ki aap ke sanyojak main matadaata kii dilchaspee kitni he
 Kejriwal is perhaps the only senior member in this slowly standing party who is not surprised by this ratio
 unki bhavishyavaanee he, ‘‘4 disambar ko jab dilli kaa matadaata poling booth ke baahar qatari main khadaa hoga tab tak aapke prati rujhaan nirnaayak had tak bad jayega
 He pointed to the stern attitude of the Election Commission that around 14 lakh bogus voters have been rejected

 kejariwal kehete hai, ‘‘inase puri dilli kii samasyaayein pehali baar khulkar saamne aaengi
 "seeing the increasing possibility of his party to form a state government, Kejriwal has left his disputed suggestion of a referendum to form a policy of governance," cannot run the state through a referendum

 This is very different from the referendum
 ’’kejariwal ko bharosa he ki aap jis tarah ghar-ghar jaakar sampark kar rahi he, usase vastav main vot bahut badi taadaad main milenge
 They believe that the highly divided BJP under the leadership of Sheila Dixit's Congress and Vijay Goel will not be able to garner so many votes even by resorting to big rallies and big names
 kejariwal kehete hai, ‘‘log badi reliyon main muft bhojan or nami hastiyon se manoranjan kii chaah main jate hai
 Sheila Dixit is going to be difficult if there is even a little bit of strength in these claims

 ’’ ghar-ghar jaakar sampark karne kii party kii ranneeti duusare nirvachan kshetron main bhi itnaa hi asar dikhaaegi
 Kejriwal's confidence and initial sense of euphoria among AAP workers stems from the presence of people like Bibhav

 Generally, this small modest man wearing a half-sleeved shirt, pants and big sandals with his feet is usually not seen by anyone on the streets, but today Kejriwal is in front of the public as aap's lone face
 isse judi aalochana par kejariwal kaa kahana he ki yah dharna media kii dein he
 But there is nothing wrong in introducing Yogendra Yadav as a leader
 unka kahana he ki kejariwal kaa aam aadmi jaisaa dikhnaa hi unhen janata se jodta he
 It is important to show your presence everywhere in aap's political strategy and this strategy is successfully countering the money and muscle power of mainstream parties
 kejariwal kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ke har kone main faile bhrashtachar ke changul se bharat ko sirf or sirf kranti hi bachaa sakati he
 According to him, "in our current political system, even well-intentioned people cannot give good government

 Kejriwal is confident that giving people rights at the grassroots level will bring about such a massive change that will change the "character of governments"
 ’’ ve dilli main sarkaar banane ke teen maheene main swaraj ko kanoonee darja dene kaa vaada kar rahe hai

 tendulkar pehle aise khilaadi hai jinhen aieef ne is pad se sammanit kiya he tathaa vah yah sammaan hasil karne vaale pehle aise vyakti hai jinka uddyan kaa koi becoground nahin he
 Earlier in 2008, Captain Kapil Dev, India's World Cup winner, was awarded the honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Territorial Army

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious "make in India" campaign is going to face a big challenge from the defense sector
 modi chaahate hai ki duniyabar kii companiyaan bharat main aakar bharat ke liye hathiyaar or sajo-saamaan banaaen or bhartiya raksha pratishthan itane majboot hon ki ve duusare mulkon se aadhunik takanic kharidne kii bajaae bechney kii haisiyat main aa saken
 But the reality is that the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), the apex government body that makes defense related equipment and technology in the country, is taking 10-10 years to patent each of its discoveries and equipment
 apni khoj par patent nahin mil paane kii sthiti main diardio antarrashtriya pratiraksha bazaar se aankh milaae to kaise?india today ne diardio kii ore se samvedansheel missile pranali ke bare main daali gai darjanon patent argiyon kii ek-ek kar padtaal kii or paaya ki paanch saal pehle daali gai zyaadaatar argiyon par to abhi vichaar bhi shuru nahin hua he
 These applications were related to missiles that have to be successfully fired in inaccessible, inaccessible areas and under adverse conditions
 dilachasp yah he ki desh kaa patent karyaalay in argiyon ko bilkul tavajjo nahin de rahaa, par rus, dakshin africa or singapore jaise deshon se kai argiyon ko do saal ke andar patent praaanpatr mil gaya
 drdo's Pune Laboratory Research and Development Stablishment (engineering), a pioneer in the manufacture of latamicile launchers and robotics nearby and abroad, designed the mobile missile launch system for the brahmos missile in 2007
 isse jude alag-alag patent hasil karne ke liye 2009 main arji lagaai gai
 None of these applications has received a patent in five years
 kuch par likhaa he ki aavedan kaa pareekshan kiya janaa he, to baaki par likhaa he ki aavedan kaa pareekshan chal rahaa he
 Meanwhile, similar patent applications filed in 2010 were issued by South Africa in May 2012 and Singapore in November 2012
 ab dekhieh brahmos missile ke liye hi banaae ja rahe mobile missile autonomas launture ko bharat main patent kaa intjaar he, jabaki rus sarkaar ne ise patent jari kar diya he
 This launcher was designed by a team of 35 scientists from India and Russia after three years of hard work
 yah launture khaas taur par nausena ke liye taiyaar kiya gaya he
 The oldest of the patent applications scrutinized by Make in India India Today is in 2006
 ‘‘electric conector maikenism’’ ke liye ab tak patent jari nahin kiya gaya he
 The absence of a patent simply means that your technology can be stolen at any time, and there is a possibility of widespread misuse
 jab duusare deshon se hamaari takanic ko patent mil saktaa he to apane desh main aakhir itnaa vakt kyon lag rahaa? apane chah patenton kii baat joh rahe diardio ke ek vaigyanik kaa dard he, ‘‘takanic kii duniya bahut teji se badalati he, aise main aath-das saal baad to hamaari mehnat kooda ho jaaegi
 "DRDO is not ready to speak openly on this issue
" sanstha ke soochna nideshak or varisht vaigyanik ravi kumaar gupta kaa tark he ki ‘‘patent na milane se zyada fark nahin padataa
 The equipment and technology that our armies have to use can be used
 patent kaa mukhya makasad to yah he ki aapaki takanic koi doosraa hasil na kar sake or kare to aapako roylty de
 On reminding them of "make in India", he says, "DRDO has not been very aggressive on technology exports so far, but different stakeholders will participate in projects like Make in India, so very slow patents The process can present a challenge
 ’’ yani raksha bazaar khulte hi patent jaruri honge
 Earlier, on August 5 this year, the then Defense Minister Arun Jaitley delayed India's 10 major defense projects, which also cited the long time spent in acquiring indigenous technology in the Rajya Sabha
 apane bayaan main unhone kaha ki lite combat aircraft phej 2 kii dedline disambar 2008 se badhaakar march 2015 karne kii ek vajah yah bhi rahi ki bade deshon ne takanic dene se manaa kar diya
 There is a reason for extending the "ground-to-air long-range missile" deadline from May 2011 to December 2015, because many technologies were developed for the first time
 ‘‘naival lite combat vehical phej vanya main chaar saal kii deree kii vajah anumaanit se kahin aadhunik takanic kii jarurat aan padana rahi
 This statement clearly indicates that India did not have the right technology at the right time and there is a need to work fast in this field
 gupta ke mutabik, is samay diardio ke 500 se zyada patent argiyaan lambit hai
 a six-year backlog in the patent office warns a senior officer in the Mumbai office of the department, "if it takes several years for a petition to be published or the investigation to begin, and in the meantime another party will If the technology is created, then the patent can also go to the other party's account
 ’’ is adhikari ke shabdon main, ‘‘patent vibhaag main kam se kam chah saal kii pending list chal rahi he or diardio yaa kisi duusari sanstha ko isamen koi variyata nahin he
 "even if the patent is obtained after a decade and then the case goes to court, then God is the owner, because the patent is valid only for the next 20 years from the date of application in India
" patent offis main is samay 1
 5 lakh applications pending
 patent vibhaag ke kaamkaaj ko tej karne ke liye pichhali sarkaar ne yahaan 254 adhikariyon-karmchaariyon kii bhartee kaa prastaav banaaya tha
 The new government pushed this proposal as soon as it arrived
 philhal do maheene se yah prastaav vitt mantralay kii manjuuri ke liye padaa he
 However, having these recruits does not mean that the work of the Patent Department will take place overnight
 china or pakistan jaise padosiyon kii maujuudagi main bhartiya vaigyanikon kii raksha sambandhi khojon ko ek muhar ke intjaar main sadate rahane kii ravaayat ko bharat kab tak dhota rahegaa? Dual sim smartphones are quite popular in India
 kah sakate hai ki bharat main bikne vaale zyaadaatar smartphone main dual sim saport hota he
 But Apple has not yet launched the dual sim variant of iphone in any market
 kai bhartiya yugers isliye bhi yphone nahin kharidte, kyonki unhen lagata he ki itane paise laga kar ek sim vaala phone kyon khariden
 There are reasons to use dual sim
 taaja report bhartiya yugers ke liye acchhee he jisamen kaha ja rahaa he agle yphone main dual sim saport diya ja saktaa he
 Let's know why
 ios 12 ke diagnostic report main do sim slot kaa zikr he
 It has a second SIM status, so it is believed that two sims can also be supported in ios 12
 itnaa hi nahin report ke mutabik ios 12 ke beta main second sim trey states bhi paaya gaya he
 Since dual SIM has not been provided in the iphone so far and if this report is true, then it is possible to provide dual SIM support in a variant of iphone in September
 haalanki company kii taraf se aisa kuch bhi nahin kaha gaya he
 Although this is not the first time that dual SIM reports are coming in iphone, such reports have been coming even before this
 report ke mutabik is baar company teen nae iphone launch karegi
 Along with the iphone x Plus, this time the iphone SE 2 can also be seen, which will be of lower price
 iphone x Plus yaa iphone 11 Plus kii screen sies 6
 It will be 5 inches, while the screen size of the other model is 6
 1 inch kii hogi
 The dummy models of these two can be seen on Twitter

 dedh saal ho gaye magar halaat main sudhaar nahin ho sakaa he
 april-june quarter - 8
 0%, july-sitambar kii timahi- 7
 0%, october-december quarter-6
 6%, janvari-march kii timahi 5
 8%
 or ab march se june kii jidipi 5
 It has come down from 8 to 5 percent
 krishi, matsay paalan, khanan, manuphaccharing, construction, real estate kii haalat karaab he
 The growth rate in agriculture is 2 percent
 2018-19 kii pehali timahi main 5
 Was 1 percent, which is now 2 percent
 hamen pataa bhi nahin he ki gaanvon main kya haalat he lekin bijness akhabaaron main gramin kshetron se maang main baari kami kii khabaren dabi jubaan main aa rahi thim
 The manufacturing sector has completely collapsed
 isi sector ke liye mek in india laayaa gaya tha
 3 in the quarter of March
 1 pratishat growth rate tha jo ab 1 pratishat se bhi neeche aa gaya he
 Only 0 in manufacturing
 6 pratishat kii vikaas dar rahi he
 12 in the first quarter of 2018-19
 1 pratishat vikaas dar thi
 11 in the manufacturing sector in a year and a half
 5 pratishat kii giravat hui he
 These are the sectors where organized and unorganized employment is more
 agar yahaan dedh saal se giravat aa rahi he to aap samaj sakate hai kyon news channelon par chhaapon or neshnal silebus kii khabaren bad gai hai
 Look at the recordings of the news channels, the sound of the decline in India's economy will not be heard
 tarah tarah ke muddon par dibet paidaa kiye ja rahe hai jaise diwali ke samay nakli maave kii mithai banati he usee tarah channelon par nakli muddon par dibet ho rahaa hota he
 There is no sector that is not going through a deep crisis
 ham nahin jaanate hai ki berojgaaron par kya guzar rahi he, jinaki naukariyaan ja rahi hai un par kya guzar rahi he, jo vyapaaree karz ke boj se barbaad ho rahe hai unki kahani kahin nahin he
 There is no major sector that is growing in double digit
 trade, hotel, sanchaar ke sector main hi 7 pratishat kii dar se vikaas hua he
 Electricity sector has recorded the highest growth, 8
 6 pratishat
 After that there is also a decline in the construction sector
 cement, steel main giravat he
 The mining sector is also in bad shape
 november 2016 main notebandi hui thi
 It was then said that it would be good in the coming times
 phir 1 july 2017 ko jiesti lagu hui, kaha gaya ki aane vaale samay main acha hoga
 But that time has not come yet
 saare bade sector rengte nazar aa rahe the
 Recently, Pooja Mehra analyzed in The Hindu that the total investment of companies decreased by 60 percent since demonetisation
 pehle 10 lakh karod se adhik nivesh ho rahaa tha jo 2017-18 main 4 lakh 25 hazaar karod par aa gaya
 There has been such a shortage
 phir bhi notebandi ke phaayde ginaae jate rahe
 The Reserve Bank has just reported
 daawa kiya jaataa he ki cashlesh ichonmi kii taraf bad rahe hai magar data aata he ki cash kaa chalan bad gaya he

 In a factory in Faridabad, dust has accumulated on many machines
 old faridabad kii is factory main kameez ke kaaler main lagane vaale teps jaisi saamagree banati he
 For the last six to seven months, these machines have been gathering dust and the owner is counting interest
 sirf do mashiinon kaa daam 48 lakh he lekin kaam kuch nahin he
 The person selling the machine also met here
 unhone bataaya ki aaj kal mashin bhi koi nahin kareed rahaa he
 Machine sales are down by about 60 to 70 percent
 is factory main jitne log kaam karte hai pehle 24 ghante kaam karte the, kaam band nahin hota tha, lekin aaj kal hafte main do yaa teen din chuttee hoti he
 This is also affecting salary
 6 se 8 karod kaa bijness ghat kar 2 se 3 karod par aa gaya he
 Its owner said that there is another factory nearby which is closed
 uske baad susheel mahapaatr dilli ke kabeernagar gaye
 Stitching of jeans pants or shirt is done at this place

 This is all retail work
 dihadi mazaduron kii in kaamon se kamai hoti he
 Earlier here, six to eight thousand commodities used to come for stitching, which has now reduced to less than four thousand
 pichley do maheene se mazdoor khaali baithe hai
 Some have returned to the village and some are living by demanding credit
 yahi haal is ilaake kii duusari choti factriyon kaa bhi he
 People usually work in homes here
 har ghar kii yahi kahani ho gai he
 This ready-made shop in Kabirnagar has been on board for five days
 lekin dukaan ke andar karidaar nahin he
 The shopkeeper said that no one is coming to collect the goods

 Friday is becoming the name of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman
 aaj thok main saarvajanik kshetra ke bainkon kaa vilay kiya gaya he
 In 2017 there used to be 27 government banks, now only 12 are left
 bainkon kii kshamta or kamazori ko dekhte hue vilay kiya gaya he taaki nae bank kii balanceshit main sudhaar ho
 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that in FY18, only 2 banks were in profit but now 14 banks are running in profit
 vitt mantri ne yah bhi kaha ki karmchaariyon kii chantni nahin hogi
 Risk officers can also be taken from outside in banks
 vilay se karz dene kii laagat kam hogi, bainkon kaa sansaadhan badhegaa
 Their losses will be less
 punjab neshnal bank ke saath ariyantal bank and commers or united bank kaa vilay kiya gaya he
 Canara Bank, Syndicate Bank has merged
 union bank, andhra or karporation bank kaa vilay kiya gaya he
 Indian Bank and Allahabad Bank have merged
 isi april se bank aaf baroda ke saath dena bank or vijaya bank kaa vilay hua he
 With the merger, Bank of Baroda became the third largest bank in the country
 uskaa kul kaarobaar 15 lakh karod kaa ho gaya tha
 This was the first time the merger of three banks in India took place
 vilay ke samay sarkaar ne nae 5000 karod rupee bhi die the
 The Finance Minister said that 55,250 crore will be given to 10 banks
 isamen se punjab neshnal bank ko 16000 karod, union bank aaf india ko 11,700 karod, bank or baroda ko milegaa 7000 karod
 6500 crore to Kanara Bank, 2500 crore to Indian Bank, 3,800 crore to Indian Overseas Bank
 central bank of india ko 3,300 karod die jaaenge
 These money have been given so that banks can give loans to companies
 vyapaar or udyog ko karz kii kami na ho
 The management of banks will be accountable to the board
 bank chif risk afasar baahar se niyukt kar sakenge
 His salary will not be decided by the government
 bainkon main kaaryakari nideshkon kii sankhya 4 kar di gai
 Many economic experts are praising the Finance Minister's move
 unka maananaa he ki yah sahi faisla he or aage chal kar arthvyavastha ko thos aadhaar degaa
 But the leaders of the banking union are protesting
 3 lakh kii sadsyta vaali ol india banking officers confederation ne kaha he ki state bank ke marjar ke baad bhi vittiya sankat se nahin ubra he
 The merger of Bank of Baroda has not yielded any significant results
 10 bainkon ke vilay se chaar bank banaakar kuch hasil nahin hoga
 Only the non-profit asset will not appear in the balance sheet
 asaliyat nahin badalegi
 Many people also feel that new recruitment will not come in banks
 sarkaar bankeron kii selary ko lekar baat nahin karti or na hi notebandi ke samay unke yogadan ko yaad karti he
 This excuse now comes on the question of sorrow and employment
 thik he ki noujvaan rojgaar ke naam par vot nahin karte hai lekin aisa bhi nahin he ki ve rojgaar ke liye taiyaari nahin karte hai
 One effect of unemployment has been on education loans
 jin logon ne lakhon lone lekar ejineering kii he, unki neend udi hui he
 There is no job and the head is burdened with debt
 ab chunaav bhi nahin he ki koi shiksha lone maaf karne kaa abhiyaan chalaae
 The condition of government exams is bad
 koi sarkaar is par baat nahin kar rahi he
 The result of CGL17 examination of Staff Selection Commission has not come even after the end of August 2019
 hataash noujvaan 29 agast ko trend karaane lage
 Prior to this, the Staff Selection Commission had issued a statement that the result will come by November but the students are not confident
 esayssi kaa kahana he ki 2017 kii pariksha adaalat main fansi thi tab tak 2018 kii pariksha shuru ho gai, is vajah se deree hui
 Youngsters are not getting this answer
 unka kahana he ki supreme court 9 may 2019 ke apane faisle se roak hataa di thi
 The result should have come by now
 chaatro ne twitor par pradhanmantri se lekar grahamantri amit shah or jitendra singh ko bhi tag kiya he
 The same situation is with the recruitment examination of Railways
 badi sankhya main chaatro ke farm photo yaa anya takiniki kaarnon se farm riject ho gaya he
 They are very disturbing
 dur daraaj ke behad garib chaatr hamen messej karte hai ki 500 rupee lage hai farm bharne ke, hamen mauka kyon nahin mil rahaa he
 On 30 August, the Railway Recruitment Board posted a reply
 isamen likhaa he ki 17 agast se 23 agast ke bich ek link kholaa gaya tha jisamen chaatro se shikaayat maangi gai thi
 These complaints are being scrutinized
 bahut chaatro ne shikaayat kii thi ki unhe link nahin mila
 The Railway Board has said that the date has therefore been extended again
 ab 31 agast se 6 sitambar ke bich chaatr apni shikaayat darj kara sakenge
 The decision will have to be accepted by the candidate
 sabhi se kaha gaya he ki ve railway recruitment board kii website dekhte rahen
 Meanwhile, the Railway Recruitment Board Junior Engineer examination is going on
 chaatro ke paas prashnon ke screen shot ghoomane lage hai
 It is feared that the question paper has not been leaked

 It is being investigated
 mumbai divijan ne is maamle main exiaar darj kiya he
 Students in Prayagraj are agitating for the result
 daawa to karte hai ki chaar lakh parikshaarthi riselt kaa intazaar kar rahe hai magar is pradarshan main chaar hazaar bhi nahin gaye hai
 The examination for 10,768 posts for Intercollege teachers was held on July 29, 2018, but today, even after a year, the results of 8 subjects have not come and no one has been joined yet
 jinke riselt aa gaye hai unki bhi nahin
 The examiners claim that the Deputy Chief Minister had assured in the Assembly that joining would be done by September, but not completed till date
 jaanch or court cese ke kaaran aath vishyon kaa riselt roak diya gaya
 Regarding the result of this examination, the students agitated and also experienced the police sticks
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki bees baar ayog kaa rigelt ke liye gheraav kar chuke hai
 No examination is completed without theft, without leaking and without court
 agar aap sarkari naukariyon ke parikshathi hai to aap kiske bharose hai bataane kii zarurat nahin he
 The process of reinstatement of 69,000 teachers in UP has not been completed until eight months after the examination
 riselt ko lekar dharna pradarshan hota rahata he
 Restoration of 68,500 teachers of the first phase has also not been completed
 madhyapradesh main 19000 shikshakon kii bahaali ke rigelt aa gaye hai
 It is expected that the appointment letter will be received soon but the result of 11,000 cadre 2 ie secondary teachers is yet to come
 bihar se ek chaatra ne likhaa he ki daaroga kii bahaali ke liye ladakiyon kii oonchai 160 centimetre rakhaa gaya he
 Because of this, many girls will not be able to sit for the exam of the resumption
 narkatiyaganj kii anamika ne likhaa he ki bihar main ladakiyon ke liye dspi banane ke liye 155 centimetre oonchai chahie or daaroga banane ke liye 160 centimotar
 Haryana has 158 cm, Punjab has 160 cm, and UP has 152 cm
 alag alag rajyon main oonchai ko dekhte hue lagata he ki centimetre kii sharten haasyaaspad hai
 Police work no longer depends on height
 aap soch sakate hai ki parikshaarthiyon ko kis kis str par ladanaa padataa he
 Nothing happens without demonstration
 ummid he jaldi elaan ho jayega ki bihar kii ladkiyaan bagaiyr hit kii chintaa kiye police inspector ban sakengi
 The number in which i receive messages, i see Hindustan differently

 If i take the name of an exam, we get messages from Punjab, from Rajasthan, Bengal, Bihar and UP

 Also think if they go into the system will they do anything better
 aap yakeen karenge ki bihar main 36 saal baad danta chikitsakon kii niyukti ho rahi he

 betiyon ke haq main rashtravyapee 'beti bachaao-beti padhaao' abhiyaan shuru karne ke liepradhanmantri narendra modine haryana kaa chayan kiya he
 Keeping in mind the poor sex ratio, this campaign, which is started against girl child feticide, is not a matter of pride for Haryana
 balikaon kii suraksha or shiksha, sikudte linganupaat, balika bhrun hatya par roak or mahilaon kii adhikarikta par logon ko samvedansheel banane ke liye modi guuruuvaar ko panipat shahar se abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karenge
 Haryana is one of the states in the country with the worst sex ratio (number of females per one thousand males)
 rajya main balak ke mukaable balikaon kii bhi sankhya kharaab he or is morche par bure record ko dekhte hue haryana kaa chayan kiya gaya he
 There are 15 districts in the country where the sex ratio is very poor, out of which 9 are from Haryana alone
 is baat kaa ullekh modi pehle bhi kar chuke hai
 In fact, in terms of sex ratio, 100 poor districts comprise 12 districts of Haryana while neighboring Punjab has 11 districts
 desh ke yahi do rajya aise hai jinaki sthiti is maamle main buree he
 With 23 districts of both the states, their joint capital Chandigarh is also included in the list

 Input from IANS purv pradhanmantri atal bihariwajpeyika lakhanu se chunavi naata to tha hi, lekin yahaan ke ekmuslim parivaarake saath unka vishwaas or bharose kaa anokhaa rishta tha
 This family, who feeds Kimami Sevai to Vajpayee, will not celebrate Eid this time in his memory
 uttar pradesh kii bhartiya janata party kii sarkaar main pehle muslim mantri or vakil ejaj rizvi aurrtal bihari vaajapeyiek duusare ko dashakon se jaanate the
 When Vajpayee filed the election papers for the Lucknow Lok Sabha seat, the work of preparing all his papers was with Aijaz Rizvi
 varsh 1998 main ejaj rizvi ke nidhan ke baad bhi is parivaar ke saath vaajapeyi kaa rishta badastoor bana rahaa or unhone rizvi kii beti seemaa rizvi ko na sirf raajnneeti main aane ke liye protsaahit kiya, balki mantrimandal main unhen unke pita kii viraasat bhi saunpi
 Rizvi's wife and Uttar Pradesh Urdu Academy president Asifa Zamani has a full gamut of memories of her family's relationship with Vajpayee
 un yaadon ko saajha karte hue unhone bataaya, 'atal ji or ejaj ke bich dosti kaa gaharaa naata tha
 Both knew each other from long ago
 atal ji lakhanu mail se jab dilli se lakhanu aate the to charbagh railway stesan par rizvi unhen lene jate the
 Asifa says that whenever Atal ji contested the Lok Sabha elections from Lucknow, Rizvi was responsible for preparing his nomination papers
 rizvi par unka vishwaas aisa tha ki unke banaae kagajaat par ek pal main dastakht karke namakan bhar diya jaataa tha
 Sharing her memories of Eid with the former Prime Minister, Asifa says, 'if he had been in Lucknow on Eid or Bakrid, he would have come to our house to eat lost kimami sevai
 ghar aate hi muskura kar kehete the, 'kahaan he bhai sewai, jaraa jaldi lao
 'I took care of his health and made separate kimami sevai for him, in which the amount of sugar was less
 vah shikayati lahaze main kehete bhi the, 'is baar sewai thodi kam mithi bani he
 'but used to eat smilingly
 vah mere bete asif or beti seemaa rizvi ko idi ke taur par ek ek chaandi kaa sikaa diya karte the
 Remembering those days, Asif Jama Rizvi, son of Aijaz also says in a sad tone, 'our whole family is very sad because of Atalji's death, so we will not celebrate the happiness of Bakrid festival next week

 netherland ke hegg kii antarrashtriya adaalat main kulbhushan jadhav maamle par sunwaayee khatm ho gai he
 The Pakistani side responded after India's arguments in the hearing
 paak ke vakeelon ne jadhav par aatankwaad ke aaropon ko jaij tehraate hue faansee ke faisle ko jaij tehraaya
 Pakistan also challenged the jurisdiction of the international court in this case, claiming that the Vienna Treaty does not apply in this case
 adaalat ne faisle kii taarikh jald tay karne kii baat kahi he
 Challenging the court's jurisdiction Pakistan's most important argument against India's appeal was that the international court had no right to interfere in the case
 jadhav ko faansee kii sajaa ke elaan se do hafte pehle hi yuan main pakistan kaa rajanyik maleeha lodhi ne court ko bataaya tha ki islamabad ne rashtriya suraksha se jude masalon par court ke dakhal ke adhikaar ko waapas le liya he
 Pakistani lawyers reminded that India had already made such a declaration in 1974
 senior vakil khwaar kuraishi ne is silsile main atlantis vimaan ko giraane se jude cese kaa bhi zikr kiya
 He said that in this case also, the court had considered the fact of not having jurisdiction
 jadhav cese main vienna sandhi lagu nahipakistani vakeelon ne bharat kii is daleel ko khaarij kiya ki pakistan ne jadhav ko consular acces naa dekar vienna sandhi kaa ulanghan kiya he
 The Pakistani side argued that the provisions of the Vienna Treaty do not apply in matters of national security
 unhone is maamle main america or mexico ke bich aise hi ek vivaad kaa bhi hawala diya
 On Counselor Access, Safavikhar Qureshi said that India and Pakistan had entered into a mutual agreement on the treatment of each other's prisoners in 2008
 is samjhaute ke tahat rashtriya suraksha se jude maamalon main donon desh kisi kaidi ko counslar acces dene se inkaar kar sakate hai
 Qureshi refuted India's claim that Jadhav's alleged confession was taken even before India's counselor access was requested
 jadhav par aaropon ko jaij tehrayapakistan ne international court main bharat ke is daawey ko khaarij kiya ki jadhav ko iran se agava kiya gaya tha
 Pakistani lawyers said that Jadhav is the current commander of the Indian Navy and that he was spreading terrorism in Pakistan through Iran
 in aaropon ke samarthan main pakistani paksh ne jadhav ke kathith kaboolname ke video kaa bhi hawala diya
 However, the court did not allow the video to be shown during the hearing
 pakistani paksh ne daawa kiya ki bharat ne jadhav ke paas farji naam kaa passport hone kii safai nahin di he
 Pakistani lawyers also dismissed the apprehension that Jadhav may be hanged soon
 kuraishi ne bataaya ki jadhav ke paas ab bhi kanoonee vikalp maujuud hai

 gujarat chunaav main is baar congress bijepi ko takkar detii dikh rahi thi, lekin is ladaai main bijepi ek baar phir se jitati dikh rahi he
 Exit polls are at least doing this
 congress kaa vot share badhane ke baad bhi phir se uske hisse haar aa sakati he
 Exit polls have been proved wrong many times before
 aise main atakalein abhi bhi jari hai, jinka patakshep 18 disambar ko hi hoga
 But once it is necessary to know how close the exit polls have been to the actual results in the last elections
 2004 main agsit pole fail2004 main jis vakt atal bihari bajpeyi kii sarkaar ke saae main india shining kaa naaraa buland tha, us vakt haregsit polane yahi bataaya tha ki vaajapeyi dobaaraa satta par kabiz honge
 But the opposite happened, the UPA came to power
 2009 kaa ellection2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main adwani ke netritv main jis vaktbijepicongress se loha le rahi thi, us vakt agsit pole ne yah to bhaanp liya ki bijepi kii sarkaar nahin banegi, lekin sahi aankade ke kareeb koi nahin pahunchaa
 Alam is that the exit poll of one channel gave the maximum number of seats - 218, while in fact UPA got 262 seats
 2014 main agsit polmodi kii lokapriyata ke rath par savaar bijepi kaa 2014 main jeetna to tamaam agenciyon ne bhaanp liya lekin sahi aankade ke kareeb sirf chanakya agency pahunchi, jisane agtil pole main kaha ki bijepi ko 340 siten milengi or milin 339
 But in the Lok Sabha elections a wave works which is relatively easy to detect
 lekin kya vidhansabha chunaavon ke nateezon ke bare main agsit pole se janaa ja saktaa he? beete teen saal main hue chunaavon ke nattejey agsit pole se saae main kaise rahe, ise samajhate hai
 The exit polls were proved correct in the 2014 Maharashtra elections
 -2014 main hue haryana chunaav main lagbhag aadhi agenciyon ke agsit pole sahi sabit hue
 Exit polls were not giving majority to anyone in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly elections and this happened
 -jharkhand main agsit pole ke aankadon ke mutabik bijepi ko jeet mili lekin bilkul sateek aankada koi nahin bataa paaya
 In the 2015 Delhi Assembly Elections, the exit poll showed the victory of the Aam Aadmi Party, but no one could have imagined 67 seats and every exit poll failed to detect the undercurrent wave in a sense
 -bihar main eczit pole sire se galat sabit hue
 Half the agencies in West Bengal passed the examination
 unke agsit pole ke aankade aas-paas rahe or ‘didi’ kii sarkaar phir paas ho gai
 Exit polls in Tamil Nadu proved to be wrong
 diemke kii jeet kaa anumaan laga rahe agsit pole ko tab jhatka laga jab nattejey ammaa ke paksh main aae
 Most of the exit polls had predicted bjp's bumper victory in Assam assembly elections last year, which turned out to be correct
 -kerala main zyaadaatar agsit pols main sattadhari udief ke bedakhal hone kaa anumaan jataayaa gaya tha or ye anumaan sahi sabit hue
 -puducherry proved easy to estimate for most exit polls
 sabhi ne ek swar main congress-diemke kii jeet kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi, jo sahi sabit hui
 In Uttarakhand, two big exit polls showed BJP winning, while two showed equal competition with Congress
 nateeja bijepi ke paksh main rahaa
 Though the exit poll in Punjab had realized that the BJP government was not being formed, but a collision was shown between Aam Aadmi Party and Congress which proved to be wrong
 -goa main agsit pole galat sabit hue
 All showed an edge to the BJP, but more seats came from the Congress
 ye alag baat he ki chunavi jod-tod ke khel main bijepi congress se 21 sabit hui or sarkaar bijepi ne hi banaai
 Exit poll of only India Today Axis in Manipur proved to be accurate, which gave Congress between 30 and 36 seats and Congress got 31 seats
 aise main agsit pole ko sire se khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa, lekin yah maan lenaa ki agsit pole bilkul sahi sabit hote hai, ye bhi galat he
 The exit poll test in Gujarat is more because after a long time the BJP did not seem to be moving towards a unilateral victory and Rahul Gandhi was seen taking on Modi on the ground
 jaahir he gujarat nateezon kii bhavishyavaanee aasaan nahin he lekin agar agsit pole hawa ko bhaanpane main sahi sabit hue hai to kaha ja saktaa he ki tagdi ladaai ke baad bijepi satta main aa sakati he

 This was first seen in the politics of Bihar when Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar came together for almost two decades to defeat Narendra Modi and BJP
 aane vaale samay main uttar pradesh bhi is sameekaran kaa gavaah ban saktaa he
 In fact, Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav has extended the hand of friendship to the head of his arch-rival Bahujan Samaj Party

 Ramgopal Yadav has spoken of joining hands with both parties to wipe out BJP in Uttar Pradesh
 haalanki unhone yah bhi kaha ki vahamayawatike prashansak nahin he

 People all over the country are celebrating Eid
 har jagah khushi kaa maahaul he
 But there is also a place where weeds have spread
 nafarti hinsa kaa shikaar hue junayd ke ghar or haryana ke uske gaanv main id ke din khushi nahin he
 The family and the people of his village together are demanding justice for the death
 idgah pahunche sabhi gaanv waalon ne baajuon par kaali pattee baandh kar namaaj ata kii or junayd kii hatya kaa virodh kiya
 This was the case, Junaid Hafeez was going from Delhi to Ballabhgarh on Thursday night by local train
 unki umr 16 saal thi
 The mob was beaten to death in the train
 hua aisa ki junayd, unke bhai hashim or shakir or padosi dost mohsin dilli ke sadar bazaar se id kii kharidari kar ghar laut rahe the
 When he boarded the train, the train was completely empty, so he also got a seat to sit on
 aage chalakar okhla main 20-25 log train main chadhe the
 Climbing was a drag
 usee main junayd ko dhakka laga to wo neeche gir gaye
 On this, Junaid said why are you pushing
 unhone unke sar par topi dekh kar kaha ki tum musalmaan ho, deshadrohi ho, tum pakistani ho, maance-meet khate ho
 Those people removed the cap from the head and tried to catch his beard
 jab unhone rokane kii koshish kii to unhone maar-peet shuru kar di
 He kept beating them till the next station came to Tughlakabad
 vahaan se un logon ne apane bhai ko phone kiya or madad ke liye bulaayaa
 His elder brother reached Ballabhgarh station
 lekin ballabhagarh pahunchane par un logon ne unhen train se utarane nahin diya
 They fell down and climbed on top of them
 jab unke bhai unhen bachaane ke liye train par chadhe to un logon ne unhen andar khinch liya or unke saath bhi maar pitayee kii
 Some people got off the train from Ballabhgarh and from here onwards the train started, then they took out the knife and started killing Shakir
 junayd ne bichbachaav kiya to unhone junayd ko bhi maaraa
 He had killed Junaid so much that he fell down
 unhen laga ki junayd mar gaye hai to agle stesan asaavati main unhen phenk diya
 After that he descended from the back side of the train while we descended from the platform
 phir un logon ne ambulance ko phone kiya
 When the train started from Okhla, there were only 20-25 people, but gradually the train got crowded and leaving them the whole box was filled with non-muslims
 puure dibbe ke log ek ho gaye the
 Everyone said that they are Muslims, they are malevolent and kill them

 He told that, one accused has been arrested in this case and some other accused accused have been identified
 unako jald giraftaar kiya jayega
 The villagers tied their black band and registered their protest

 Junaid's house will be known by people
 Let us know that all the people in Junaid's family continue to come
 kuch log kaali pattee baandhakar unke ghar pahunche hai, to kuch ek duusare gaanv se yahaan pahunche hai
 On this issue, we spoke to Junaid's father Jalaluddin, he clearly said that the government should take concrete steps in this direction and strict action should be taken against the culprits
 saath hi unhone bataaya ki ab tak sarkaar kii taraf se koi numaayinda yahaan nahin pahunchaa

 Must learn

 a case has been registered in a Meerut court against the alleged statement of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray, who described Uttar Pradesh and Bihar as a bastion of terror
 gauratlab he ki raaj ne pichley dinon kathith taur par ek bayaan diya tha ki desh ke uttari rajyon se aane vaale logon ke kaaran hi mumbai main aatankwaad kii ghatnaayen hoti he

 There are reports of farmers' suicides coming from different parts of the country
 maharashtra kaa vidarbha ilaaka kisaanon kii aatmahatya kaa paryaay ban chukaa he
 Failure to repay debt or wastage of crops is believed to be the biggest reason behind these suicides
 haalanki sarkari aankadon main aatmahatya kii vajahon main prem prasang jaise kaaran bhi ginaae jate rahe hai

 The National Crime Records Bureau report, enumerating the reasons for farmers 'suicides, states that' family problems, illness, drug addiction, unemployment, property disputes, bankruptcy or sudden change in economic status, poverty, occupational / career problems, love affairs, Infertility / impotence, marriage cancellation or inability to get married, dowry dispute, decline in social status, many other unknown reasons
 Huh
 zaahir he krishi mantralay ke paas aatmahatyaon kaa byoraa ikaitha karne kaa apana koi zariyaa nahin he
 Therefore, the Ministry of Agriculture has always been presenting the NCRB data
 jarurat krishi mantralay kii taraf se aisi pahal kii he jisase kisaanon kii aatmahatya se jude aankade khud jutaaye jaaen jisamen karjadaar kisaanon se lekar kharaab fasal kii vajah se tabah hue kisaanon tak kaa byoraa ho
 The comments pichley dinon krishi mantri radhamohan singh ke us bayaan par bahut vivaad hua jisamen unhone kisaanon kii aatmahatya ke peeche paariwarik kalah jaise kaaran ko jimmedaar bataaya
 This statement was considered highly insensitive, although Radha Mohan Singh described it as half-baked and a statement presented with a thorn

 It is clear that the Ministry of Agriculture has no way of collecting the details of suicides
 lihaaza krishi mantralay hameshaa se enciarabi kaa aankada hi pesh karata rahaa he
 Need is an initiative by the Ministry of Agriculture to collect data related to farmers' suicides themselves, ranging from loaned farmers to farmers devastated by bad crops
 tippaniyan Recently, there was a lot of controversy over the statement of Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh in which he attributed the reason behind family suicides like farmers' suicide
 is bayaan ko behad asamvedansheel mana gaya, haalanki radhamohan singh ne ise aadha-adhuraa or kaant chhaant kar pesh kiya gaya bayaan bataaya
 He says that in his reply given in Parliament, he has responded only on the basis of the reasons enumerated by the National Crime Records Bureau
 iske saath-saath unhone apane isi jawaab main kisaanon par karj, kharaab fasal ko bhi aatmahatya kaa zimmedaar bataaya tha, lekin tool sirf pehle para ko diya gaya jabaki duusare para ko khabaron main praathamikta nahin di gai
 As long as there is a dependence on the NCRB for the statistics related to suicides, whoever the minister is, the same will be counted due to the suicides of farmers

 In a tweet, he attacked Amit Shah and said that "shah will become the Home Minister after the election"
 'loksabhaa chunaav ke baad kejariwal main badlaav dekha ja saktaa he

 unhen (kejariwal or aap) ehsaas ho gaya he ki modi ke khilaaf khadey hone kaa samay nahin he lekin log hoshiyaar hai
 They know Kejriwal's plan
 " unhone kaha ki ab jab bhaajapa ne modi ke netritv main dhamaakedaar jeet darj kii he to kejariwal ne apane haath waapas khinch liye hai, kyonki unhen ehsaas ho gaya he ki janata modi or bhaajapa ke saath he

 In the first session of Panchayat Aaj Tak Madhya Pradesh, Rural Development and Panchayati Raj and Mining Minister Narendra Singh Tomar participated on Friday
 is satr kaa sanchaalan india today samooh ke news diarector rahul kanwal ne kiya
 Rahul Kanwal asked Tomar that every eight hours a farmer of Madhya Pradesh commits suicide, why? In response to this, Union Minister Tomar said that it is very sad that farmers commit suicide or someone commits suicide
 kisaan aatmahatya ke liye majaboor na ho, yah ham sabhi kii javabdehi he lekin kisaani ke kshetra main kaam karne vaala har vyakti aatmahatya kii taraf bad rahaa he to iskaa ek kaaran nahin, kai alag-alag kaaran hai or un alag-alag kaarnon kaa alag-alag vishleshan kiya janaa chahie
 Tomar said, it is true that farming should be profitable business because if man does not do business of profit then he will surely suffer
 isliye madhya pradesh kii sarkaar ne is disha main kaam kiya he or kisaan ko jo lone 18 pratishat par diya jaataa tha, use jiro percent par kar diya gaya he
 Tomar said- As far as the suicide of farmers in Madhya Pradesh is concerned, every suicide should not be associated with agriculture and farming but it should be the commitment of the BJP government that farming should be profitable

 aaj kii daudti- bhaagti jindagi main aksar mahilaayein apane cheharaa kaa dhyaan nahin rakh paati, jis kaaran unke chehre par dust jamane lagati he
 To remove dust, facials cannot be bleached everyday, but now there is one thing through which you can look absolutely perfect and that is 'scrubbing'
 chehre kii saaf-safai ke liye scrubing ek behad acha upaay he
 Scrubbing can easily remove the faceless layer of the face, as well as bring flexibility to the skin
 aksar ham chehre kii saaf-safai ke liye clinging, tonig, or moishcharizer kaa prayog karte he, lekin scrubing ke bina chehre kii saaf-safai adhuri maani gai hai
 Pimple, black heads on the face can also be removed by scrubbing

 scrubing ko chehre par applai karte samay dhyaan rakhen ki ise tab tak na utaara jaae jab tak ki yah acchhee tarah se suukh na jaae
 If you want, you can also do scrubbing at your home yourself

 For this, mix one teaspoon orange peel powder, one teaspoon ground barley flour, one teaspoon ground coarse almonds, one teaspoon of lentil coarse powder, one teaspoon rice coarse powder
 ab koi sabji yaa fal ko is paste main mila len or chehre par lagaaein
 If you have oily skin, add honey to the scrub, then apply it on the face
 scrubing kaa istemaal karte samay in baton kaadhyaan rakhana behad jaruri hota he:-market se kharide hue scrub ko sidhe hi chehre par istemaal na karen, balki isamen pani kii kuch boonden milaane ke baad prayog karen
 There are different scrubs available in the market for oily, dry and combination skin, so always choose the right scrub keeping in mind the nature of your skin
 simpal scrub ke istemaal kii bajaay aise scrub kaa istemaal karen, jisamen papeeta, khubaani ore vitamin e, si or i kii prachur maatra ho
 Because such scrubs protect the face from pollution, sunlight and dust and dirt
 kuch logon ki skin par kai chijen suut nahin karti, aise main market main maujuud mild scrub aapke liye behatar opshan he
 Whenever using a scrub, apply it more on the cheeks, forehead and chin
 kyonki chehre ke yahi bhaag dhul-mitti se sabase zyada prabhavit hote hai
 After using the scrub, use a moisturizer on the face
 aksar ham chehre kii saaf-safai ke liye clinging, tonig, or moishcharizer kaa prayog karte he, lekin scrubing ke bina chehre kii saaf-safai adhuri maani gai hai

 When applying scrubbing on the face, take care not to remove it until it dries well
 yadi aap chaahe to apane ghar par khud bhi scrubing kar sakati he
 For scrubbing you must first make a paste
 iske liye ek chota chammach santare ke chhilke kaa powder, ek chota chammach pisa hua jau kaa aataa, ek chammach pisa hua dardara baadaam, ek chota chammach masoor kii daal kaa dardara powder, ek chota chammach chaaval ke dardare powder ko aapas main mila len
 Now mix any vegetable or fruit in this paste and apply it on the face
 yadi aapaki skin oili he to scrub main shahad mila len, uske baad ise chehre par applai karen
 It is very important to keep these things in mind while using scrubbing: - Do not use the scrub bought from the market directly on the face, but after adding a few drops of water to it
 market main oili, dry or combination skin ke liye alag-alag scrub milte hai, isliye hameshaa apni skin ke nechar ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sahi scrub kaa chayan karen
 Instead of using simple scrub, use a scrub that contains papaya, apricot and abundant amounts of vitamins A, c and E
 kyonki aise scrub pradushan, dhoop or dhul-mitti se chehre kii raksha karte hai
 For some people, skin does not suit many things, so the mild scrub in the market is a better option for you
 jab bhi scrub kaa istemaal karen, ise gaalon, maathe or chin par adhik lagaae
 Because these parts of the face are most affected by dust
 scrub ke prayog ke baad chehre par moishcharizer kaa istemaal jarur karen
 For scrubbing you must first make a paste
 iske liye ek chota chammach santare ke chhilke kaa powder, ek chota chammach pisa hua jau kaa aataa, ek chammach pisa hua dardara baadaam, ek chota chammach masoor kii daal kaa dardara powder, ek chota chammach chaaval ke dardare powder ko aapas main mila len

 baavjood iske party ne unhen tikat nahin diya
 The General Secretary of Maruti Ughog Kamgar Union alleges that when the AAP party met for the nomination of Lok Sabha seats, he led the working class in front of Kejriwal and said that the workers were given the Gurgaon and Faridabad Lok Sabha and about 10 assembly seats in Haryana
 Go so that any representative from the laborers can also come to the government, but this is a deception with the workers and no longer think that Faridabad Lok Sabha Seat will give workers the ticket
 kuldeep kaa aarope he ki party ne 31 janvari namakan ke liye aakhri taarikh tay kii gai thi lekin yogendra yadav ne apane naam ke elaan ke din se kuch dinon pehle hi apana namakan daakhil kiya jo ki bilkul galat he

 aap party apni hi nitiyon main khud hi ghirti hui najar aa rahi he
 The workers have called a massive rally in Gurgaon on March 5, due to the lack of tickets for the leadership of the workers from the Gurgaon Lok Sabha seat, in which a big decision can be taken

 The Supreme Court has dismissed the new proposal of the Sahara group, giving a shock to Subrata Roy
 ab 11 march se pehle roy kii rihaai kii sambhaavna khatm ho gai he
 Let us tell you that the court had fixed the date of hearing on March 11 and said that they can propose to return the money of the investors even before that
 sahaara samooh ne shuukravaar ko teen dinon ke bheetar niveshkon ke 2500 karod rupee lautaane kaa prastaav rakhaa, jise par sebi ne asahmati jataai thi
 Sahara in its proposal had told the Supreme Court that it would return all the investors' money by July 2015
 usne prastaav main kaha ki vah teen dinon ke bheetar 2500 karod kaa bhugtan karegaa or baaki rakam har teen maheene par kishton main degaa
 But when the Supreme Court sought Sebi's opinion on this proposal of Sahara, it opposed the proposal
 sebi ne kaha ki company keval 17,000 hajaar karod bhugtan karne kaa vaada kar rahi he jabaki dendaree 37,000 karod kii he
 The Supreme Court agreed to a special bench for hearing on Subrata Roy following Sahara's proposal, but later rejected it
 court ne kaha ki sahaara kaa prastaav adaalat kaa apmaan he
 The court said that it is an insult to gather for a man who does not want to return the money
 vahiin, sahaara ne aaj supreme court se apil kii ki subrat roy or anya do nideshkon ko police hiraasat main bheja jaae kyonki nyaayik hiraasat main un tak pahunchane main dikkat aa rahi he
 The court allowed Roy to meet his lawyers, sons and financial advisors from 10 am to 2 pm
 isi ke saath sahaara group ne court se aagrah kiya ki subrat roy ko paise jutaney ke liye hiraasat se chode jane kii anumati di jaae
 Sahara said that the longer Roy remains in custody, the more difficult it will be to raise money
 aapako bataa den ki subrat roy philhal tihaad jail main band hai
 He was sent to jail on Tuesday when he failed to satisfy the judges in the Supreme Court
 ve court ko yah nahin bataa paae ki ve kaise apane inwestors ko 20 hajaar karod kii rakam waapas karenge
 Roy has been directed by the Supreme Court to remain in jail till 11 March next hearing

 In a video shaming humanity, a young man is brutally beating a minor girl with a stick

 The video was delivered to the victim's mother by Raghavendra Singh, who lives in her neighborhood

 After identifying the girl and showing this video to her mother Vati, she too identified her

 He had sought help from the police several times, but no one listened

 Why action was not taken even after complaining

 If the girl is not found, will the police consider it to be negligence and will also take action against the responsibilities

 Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Rajiv Shukla told reporters in Parliament House Complex, 'there should be a healthy discussion on inflation
 sarkaar har ek baat kaa jawaab dena chaahegi, lekin vipaksh sirf hangaamaa karnaa chahta he
 He does not want to give constructive suggestions to reduce inflation

 DMRC has refused to provide free water to passengers traveling in the Delhi Metro
 metro main free pani kii suvidha dene ke maamle se judi yachika par dilli hycourt main sunwaayee hui
 During this time, DMRC has raised its hand in the matter of giving free water to the passengers
 dmarsi ne kaha ki usne ek internal survey bhi karaayaa he jisamen logon ko yatra ke dauraan pani kii zyaada zarurat nahin he or jinako he wo 2 rupee prati litre ke hisaab se pani metro stesan se kharid sakate hai
 The Delhi High Court had, in a previous hearing, asked the DMRC, in a stern tone, not to provide free water to passengers in the metro, why it cannot provide this basic facility to its passengers, while free water facility in the metro running in different parts of the country
 is present
 darasal, har roj takreeban 27 lakh log dilli main metro se safar karte hai
 So by providing free water facilities to so many people, dmrc's budget will definitely increase
 or isiilie muft pani dene kii suvidha ko lekar wo taalamatol karti aa rahi he
 The PIL in the Delhi High Court is not only for free water but also to install dustbins for cleanliness and also to provide toilet facilities to passengers at every station
 dustbin ko lekar dmarsi or siaisef ne court ko bataaya ki suraksha ke maddenjar metro stesan ke andar dustbin nahin lagaae gaye hai
 If dustbins are installed, they can pose a major threat to the safety of passengers
 toilet kii suvidha dene ko lekar bhi dmarsi kaa kahana he ki kuch metro stesan par ye suvidha maujuud he or kuch jagahon par jo staff ke liye toilet hai, yatri staff se kahkar uskaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 Many important questions have been raised in this petition
 masalan pani aisi jarurat he jiske liye inkaar nahi kiya ja saktaa, lekin dmarsi wo bhi yatriyon ko muft main dene ko taiyaar nahin he
 While getting this facility is also necessary because the metro includes a large number of women traveling with young children and the elderly who often need water to eat medicines
 baharhaal ab dmarsi ke halafnaamein par hoicourt ne yachikakarta ko 6 hafte main apana jawaab dena kaa nirdesh diya he

 gujarat main koun padegaa baari? BJP kaa ‘vikaas mantra’ yaa congress kaa ‘soft hindutv’narendra modi mukhyamantri the to bijepi desh bhar main gujarat ke vikaas model kii duhai dete nahin thakti thi
 Riding on the chariot of this Gujarat development model, Narendra Modi conquered the throne of Delhi in 2014
 saath hi modi kaa kad itnaa bada ho gaya ki uski chaaya ke neeche puri bijepi hi dab kar rah gai
 It would be called a political irony that the development horse which had run for Modi in 2014 on the Rajpath was now being said in Gujarat for the same - 'vikas Gando Thayo Chhe' means 'vikas has gone mad'
 gujarat main vidhansabha chunaav se pehle ‘vikaas gando thayo che’ kii gunj itani jor se sunai dene lagi ki modi ko khud hi gujarat main aakar kahana padaa- 'hum vikaas chhu, hum gujarat chhu' yani ‘main vikaas hum, main gujarat hum

 The occasion was a press conference to give information on the serial blast in Bodh Gaya temple
 nitish kumaar ne bataaya ki is blast ke bare main kayaas nahin lagaae jane chahie or enie kii jaanch ke baad hi sab saaf hoga
 But after this, the political statement made by Nitish has triggered a fresh guess in political circles
 nitish ke mutabik bihar main chunaav jeetne ke liye lalu prasad yadav or narendra modi ek ho gaye hai
 Nitish said, seat sharing has taken place at the top level in both the parties
 yahaan padhie nitish ne apane rajnatik virodhiyon ke liye kya kaha
 In their words, the question: On Nitish's government's negligence after the bomb blast, Nitish's answer: We are seeing one thing in Bihar
 do dalon kii ekta saaf-saaf dikh rahi he
 We see the unity of BJP and RJD
 andarkhaane baatcheet bhi chal rahi he, or yah saadhaaran str par nahin he
 Seat adjustment is underway, inside
 mere ek kadam se sab expoj ho gaye hai
 This is a sham for power, these people can go to any level
 dekhie mahabodhi mandir main blast hua
 These times are such that there should be no division
 international level par sab dekh rahe hai
 Everyone should face the challenge together
 lekin main vahaan jaataa hum, to mere khilaaf naare lagaae ja rahe hai
 You guys also see this, this is the fury that happens when one person withdraws from power and the other who is ousted from power, then how have they come back
 to donon log mil gaye hai, ek saath milakar aage bhi bahut kaam karenge, kuch pratlaksh kuch paroksh andar andar karenge
 Question: It is being said that the government has weakened after leaving the BJP
 nitish kaa javabongar sarkaar kamjor hui he, to hamaari hui he
 He is having trouble for what hamen pareshaan hona chahie
 But this is their problem
 bijepi ke mantri bina kuch kaam kiye chhapate rahete the
 Now compensate for the same by giving a statement
 ye hamaare liye lakshya nahin he
 We have to stick to our principles

 If there is a channel, then those people who give a statement will not print roj roj karenge ve ye sab
 But my job is to speak everyday

 Tejashwi said that Nitish Kumar is supporting BJP and RSS who believe in dividing and tearing the country
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa desh main hindu muslim dange karana chaahati he
 However, Tejashwi warned the BJP that the RJD will respond with a stone if the incidents of communal violence in Bihar occur
 aarakshan ke mudde par bolte hue tejasvi ne aarope lagaaya ki bhaajapa daliton or pichhadon se aarakshan chhinana chaahati he
 Lashing out at the BJP, Tejashwi said that if any Mai has power in the red, then take away the reservation from the poor
 jadyu kii lagaataar maang par tejasvi ne apni benami sampatti kaa lekha-jokha par bolte hue kaha ki bihar kii garibon or vanchit janata hi unki asli sampatti he
 Tejashwi once again accused Nitish of raping the mandate and said that he formed a government with the BJP through the thief door
 katihaar kii sabha ko sambodhit karte hue tejasvi ne kaha ki bihar main dabl ingine kii sarkaar ban gai he, iske baavjood bhi is baar ke aam bajet main bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja kyon nahin mila?mukhyamantri par tanj kasate hue tejasvi ne kaha ki bhale hi bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja nahin mila ho magar centre kii taraf se nitish ko dilli main vishesh bangala jarur mil gaya he
 Speaking about the communal riots happening in different parts of the country, Tejashwi said that communal violence is happening continuously in the country but Prime Minister Narendra Modi is sitting silent
 apane pita or argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav ko lekar bolte hue tejasvi ne kaha ki unhen apane pita par kaaphi garv mahasoos hota he ki unhone bhaajapa dwaara daraaye or dhamkaae jane ke baavjood apane vichaardhaara ke saath koi samjhauta nahin kiya
 Tejashwi said that before going to jail, his father Lalu Prasad had said that Tejashwi should protect the people of Bihar and he has come to the public to do so
 tejasvi ne kaha ki sampradayik shaktiyon se ladane ke liye agar lalu prasad ko 100 saal bhi jail main rahanaa padegaa to unhen vah manjuur he
 Describing Lalu Prasad as a lion, Tejashwi said that his father is innocent and all the investigating agencies of the country have been engaged to discredit his family
 gau raksha ke is daur main maharashtra sarkaar ne patrakaron kii raksha ke liye ek bill pesh kiya or paas bhi ho gaya
 The BJP promised an election that was fulfilled
 yah bill agar paas hua to maharashtra main patrakaron yaa media sansthaanon par hamalaa karnaa dandaneey aparaadh ho jayega
 The management of the media institution will not benefit from this law as they will not get protection under this law
 hamaare sahyogi prasad kathe ne bataaya ki iske tahat contract, online, freelans patrakaron ko bhi sangrakshan milegaa or yah gair jamaanti aparaadh hoga
 According to the bill, the attacker on the journalist will be punished for 3 years and fined 50 thousand
 patrakarita kii aad main galat kaam karne waalon ko bhi yahi sab sazaa milegi
 Those who attack the journalist will have to bear the cost of his treatment
 media santhaan par hamalaa karne vaale ko nuksaan kii bharpai kerani hogi
 Maharashtra and other states also have laws to protect doctors
 is tarah se sabake liye alag-alag kanoon banenge to ek din vakil suraksha kanoon, vidhayak suraksha kanoon, payalat suraksha kanoon, airhostates suraksha kanoon bhi ban jayega
 Then one day someone will be poor and will say that the government should make a law for our safety also
 patrakaron ko is vakt sabase zyada suraksha kii zarurat is baat se he ki unki khabar chap jaae or jahaan kaam karte hai vahaan kam se kam patrakarita apane mulyon ke hisaab se ho jaae
 Ani they change the topic and come on the cow defense
 supreme court ne centre sarkaar or 6 rajyon ko notice jari kar teen hafte ke bheetar jawaab maanga he
 Tehsin Poonawala and Shahzad Poonawala have filed a PIL in the Supreme Court to ban the organizations targeting Dalits and minorities in the name of cow protection in the same way as organizations like SIMI
 supreme court ne centre or rajyon se jawaab maanga tha lekin jawaab nahin mila to notice jari kar diya he

 An increase from ten rupees to one and a half hundred can be tolerated in the name of a cow, but if the poor are relieved, then there is no harm in it either
 tippaniyan Apart from violence, politics in the name of cow protection, there are many such stories in the context of these issues which, if we know, can help us understand the political issue better
 gau raksha ko lekar tivi or akhabaaron par chalane vaali bahasein har ghatana ke baad unheen saare daavon ke saath haazir ho jaati hai

 aas paas ke gaanvon main jab gaayen biimaar ho jaati hai, laachaar ho jaati hai or doodh de sakane kii sthiti main nahin hoti to log chhod dete hai
 Not because they no longer love cows, so even cows cannot afford sick and old cows
 lihaaza tikaa lagaakar chhod dete hai
 Some people sell to the butchers, but many people do not have the courage to sell the cow
 lihaaza aisi gaayon ko atik mohammad sahab apni gaushala main le aate hai
 There are more than 200 cows here
 sab kii sab biimaar or laachaar
 There are veterinarians to treat them, there is an ambulance and they also get treatment in the villages of distant drawers
 atik mohammad ne bataaya ki ve skool bhi chalaate hai jahaan sabhi samudaay ke bachche padhate hai
 Not only this, sick cows are also named in Atik Ahmed's Gaushala
 ganga, jamuna, saraswati, anandi, anjali, anjudi, gita, modki, kaalki, anopadi, dholki, kanchudi, sita, lakshmi
 These are the names of cows in Atik's Gaushala
 ek gaay kaa naam sultan or mumtaj bhi he
 Atiq Mohammad said that he is not doing favor but is doing his duty
 inaki gaushala kaa get band nahin hota or gaayen baandhi nahin jaati
 Because the cow stays in the mud for a long time due to the dam, it spoils its hoofs or legs and is unable to stand

 We have to understand that cattle farming is an essential part of our agricultural system

 Apart from 'super Nani' this week, 'roar', with the message of 'bagh Bachao', ie 'save the Tiger', has also been released, directed by Kamal Sadana, who has been a hero in Bollywood, and This is his first film as a director
 
 
 'ror' kii kahani sunderbans main ghatati he, jahaan ek wildlife photographer ek safed baagh ke bachche ko taskaron ke changul se bachaata he or apane ghar le aata he, lekin is bachche kii maa use dhundte hue photographer ke ghar tak aa jaati he or use maar daalati he
 
 
 When the photographer's brother Pandit gets this news, he comes to Sunderbans with some companions to avenge the tigress
 
 
 pandit ek commando he or yah kirdaar nibhaayaa he abhinav shukla ne
 
 
 Here Pandit is assisted by Jhumpa, who is a tracker, and is played by Himarsha Venkatasamy
 
 
 ab film main ye log baaghon kii khoj main hai, or baagh inaki khoj main
 
 
 Along with this, they clash with animal smugglers, whose head is Bhira, in whose character Subrata Dutta will be seen
 
 
 ab sabase pehle baat karte hai, film kii kamiyon kii
 
 
 No power in the story 
 
 jahaan script kamazor he, vahiin dialog bhi bachakaane lagate hai
 
 
 It is difficult to find logic throughout the film
 
 
 masalan, is jangal ke sanpon ke peeche kii kahani
 
 
 If i talk about acting, most of the actors are seen as raw players in the film
 
 
 abhinav shukla or himarsha venkatsami kuch behatar hai, lekin baaki abhinayta film main sirf maujuudagi darj kara paae hai, haalanki bhira ke kirdaar main subrat datta achche lagate hai
 
 
 Now let's talk about the merits
 
 
 film ke cinemetographer maaikel watson ne kai jagah kamaal kaa kaam kiya he
 
 
 Special effects of Roar will also make you feel good
 
 
 camel sadana kii tarif is baat ke liye kii jaani chahie, kyonki unhone aisa vishay uthaaya, jise filmana mushkil tha
 
 
 He still needs more hard work to direct
 
 
 becoground score mujhe laud laga
 
 
 Those who have not seen Hollywood films on animals may be surprised to see a tiger in 'roar'
 
 
 vaise, saath hi badi eemaandaaree se ant main nirdeshak ne yah bhi bataa diya he ki film main unhone baaghon se kaam kaise karavaaya
 
 
 After all, you might like to watch the film's making
 
 
 ek acchhee baat yah bhi he ki film main jabardastee gane daalane kii koshish nahin kii gai he, lekin kul milakar puri film main ek acchhee kahani kii kami khalati rahati he
 
 
 By the way, if you want to see something different from masala films, then you can watch 'roar'
 
 
 meri taraf se film kii reating he - 2

 According to Majumdar, every candidate who has filed nomination for the panchayat will have to explain his financial status and also clear how much time he is willing to give for public service
 aisa isliye ki jab uskaa kaarykaal khatm ho to log uski haisiyat kii tulana paanch saal pehle se karke dekh saken
 There are 15 questions in the form given by the party to the candidates, in addition to the personal information of the candidates, family income and if there is any association with any political party in the past, it will also have to be mentioned

 BJP says that this proves to what extent the Trinamool leadership has been associated with corruption

 At a family function in 2001, he said that he wanted to separate and keep his managed Chinese (bajaj Hindustan) and Personal Care (now Bajaj Corp) businesses
 kisi ne unki baat par zyada dhyaan nahin diya
 Six months later, Shishir repeated the demand
 ab tak sab jaan gaye the ki shishir asal main bete kushagra ke shabd doharaa rahe hai
 Shishir said his mind to his son in private, "don't let the things i have created spread
" ”uske baad ke 13 saal main shishir ko niraash hone kii naubat nahin ai
 In 2008, his business was formally named after him and Kushagra after a family settlement
 unki companiyon kaa kaarobaar 2001-02 main 400 karod ru
 Which was now Rs 10,500 crore

 Most of the increase was due to sugar

 If all goes well, the Bajaj Group's business this year is Rs 22,000 crore

 Electricity, sugar, ethanol, personal care, real estate and infrastructure will all contribute to this

 Electricity will be a big part of their earnings

 Invested so that they could become the largest sugar producer in Asia
 yah pehla kaarobaar tha jise kushagra ne puri takat se apanaaya or teji se failaa diya
 While taking land for the first mill, he spent many days and nights on the ground and slept on the bed in the open
 is sab ke dauraan kushagra apni jadon ko nahin bhuule
 They are completely vegetarian and do not even touch alcohol
 chini milon ke maalik akasar shire se sharaab bhi banane lagate hai
 But despite this business being highly profitable, Kushagra did not come to greed
