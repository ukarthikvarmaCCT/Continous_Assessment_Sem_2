unki janmashati par bharat ke is mahaan sapoot ko salaam karata hum
 With this, another tweet from Rahul is that it is also ironic that the statue of Sardar Patel is being unveiled, but the institutions he built are all being demolished
 bharat kii sansthaaon kaa vyavasthit rup se khandit kiya janaa deshdoh se kam nahin he
 The image of unity has been created, but today there is a need for Sardar
 jab hamaari raajnneeti hindu hone yaa na hone, asli hindu hone yaa nakli hindu hone kii bahes main chali jaae to yahi vakt he apane bheetar us sardaar ko khojane kaa jo kahin gum ho gaye hai
 Who were against communalism like iron
 1941 main jab ahmedabad main dange bhadak uthe tab sardaar patel ne kaha tha aapako ekaek yah kya soojha ki aap ek-duusare ke gale kaatane lage
 i am sad that our father left
 ahmedabad shahar ke naam par kalank lag gaya
 How to delete it
 ise mitaane kaa ek hi tarika he ki ham is baat kii koshish karen ki dubaara is shahar main aisa vaataavaran paidaa na ho
 In 2002, Ahmadabad was again stained
 kya aaj ke din 84 or 2002 ke dangon ke prati sabhi ko praayshchit nahin karnaa chahie tha
 When Gandhi was assassinated, it was Patel
 unhone tab aresas par pratibandh lagaaya
 Rather, citing information under his ministry, it was clear that the people of the Sangh had distributed sweets after the murder
 11 sitambar 1948 ko patel se aresas ke sarasanghachaalak em es golwalkar ko patr likhaa tha ki hinduon ko sangathit karnaa or unki sahaayta karnaa ek baat he, lekin apni takalifon ke liye besahaara or maasoom purushon, auraton or bacchon se badla lenaa bilkul duusari baat
 Apart from this, it was also that his Congress opposition, that too with the strictness that neither the care of personality, nor of civilization, nor of civility, created a kind of uneasiness in the public
 inke saare bhaashan sampradayik vish se bhare the
 It was not necessary to instill enthusiasm among the Hindus and to manage their defense that poison spread
 is zehar kaa fal ant main yahi hua ki gandhi ji kii amuly jaan kii qurbaani desh ko sahani padi
 The entire sympathy of the government and people was not with the RSS, but against them
 gandhi ji kii mrityu par aresas waalon ne jo harsh prakat kiya or mithai banti, usase yah virodh or bhi bad gaya
 In these circumstances, there was no other way for the government to take steps against the RSS
 is pratimaa ko lekar sardaar sarovar baandh ke aas paas ke gaanv ke logon ne sawaal uthaae hai
 People from 72 villages said that they would observe a fast in protest against the unveiling of the statue on 31 October
 chulhaa band rahegaa
 The heads of 22 villages have written a letter to the Prime Minister that the forests, rivers, waterfalls, fields here have taken care of us for centuries
 ham inhen ke aasare jite rahe hai, lekin ab sab nasht kiya ja rahaa he
 Don't you think it's like celebrating someone's death
 hamen to aisa hi lagata he
 We villagers want to say with great sadness that we will not welcome you on 31 October
 aap bin bulaae mehmaan kii tarah aaenge to ham aapkaa swaagat nahin karenge
 If Sardar Patel had seen how natural resources are being destroyed, injustice is being done to us, he would have cried
 jab ham apni awaz uthaa rahe hai, aapaki police karrwai kar rahi he
 Why are you not ready to listen to our problems? lekin pradhanmantri ne kaha he ki is pratimaa ke kaaran aas paas ke adivasee logon ko rojgaar milegaa
 The Prime Minister also said that such a unity nursery should be built here so that the tourist coming here should take the plant of unity to his home and sow comments
 ab imtahaan aapkaa he, aap yani janata kaa
 Has become a tourist spot
 isliye yah spot muft nahin he
 You also should not feel that you are visiting Sardar for free, so there is a system of online tickets
 do prakaar ke tikat hai
 3-year-olds will not get tickets
 Observation Deck view, Valley of Flower, Memorial, Museum & Audio Visual Gallery, SOU site, Sardar Sarovar Dam dekhne ke liye 350 rupee ke tikat lagenge
 If you do not want to go to Observation Deck view, then there is a separate package for that
 praudh logon ko 60 rupee kaa tikat lagegaa or bacchon ko 60 rupee
 The bus charge is 30 rupees
 tikat ke maamle main bhi sardaar kii pratimaa bharat ke kai mehalon, kilon or imaaraton se mahangi ho gai he
 It would not be right to say expensive, it should be said that ticket prices are also the highest
 jabaki dilli ke laal kile kaa tikat 35 rupaya he, tajmahal kaa 50 rupaya
 Every year 70 to 80 lakh tourists come to see Taj Mahal, out of which 8 lakh are foreign tourists, there is a ticket of 1100 rupees for foreign tourists
 tajmahal se 20 karod kii kamai hoti he
 At the moment when two CBI officers have been thrown out of office for suing each other, the third officer is also facing charges, the Reserve Bank of India is fighting for its autonomy, even on the Election Commission Questions are being raised
 pradhanmantri patel ke banaae hue steel frem ko yaad kar rahe hai
 The warlord who fought for everyone, everyone is fighting for that chieftain
 isliye sardaar sardaar the, unhen lekar ladane vaale sardaar nahin ho sakate hai
 You yourself also heard the Prime Minister's speech
 unhone bahut hi sahajata se apane bhaashan main sardaar ke yogadanon kaa ekikaran apni sarkaar kii yojanaon se kar diya
 Even after this, the Prime Minister said that there should be no politics regarding the statue of Sardar
 unka khud kaa bhaashan raajnneeti se bharaa he yaa vaaki gaiyr raajnneetik bhaashan he, aapako tay karnaa he
 In fact, it is a great injustice with Sardar Patel's legacy that his talk is always in the context of Nehru, while his life was in reference to Gandhi
 unhone kabhi pradhanmantri pad kii daavedaari nahin kii, na hi congress ke adhyaksh pad ke liye gutbazi
 Once he left the practice, Aisho left the rest and left for a lifetime
 nehru or patel donon hi waakif the ki unhen lekar kis tarah kii charchaa hoti he
 In December 1950, Patel had to leave Delhi at the behest of doctors
 chhodane ke pehle patel ne emvi gadgil se kaha ki main ab nahin jiunga
 Make a promise to me gadgil ne haa kaha tab patel ne unka haath apane haath main lekar kaha ki pandit ji se tumhaare jitne bhi matbhed hon, lekin unka saath mat chhodana
 This was Sardar Patel
 rajmohan gandhi ne patel kii jeevani main pej number 532 par yah prasang likhaa he
 On 2 October 1950, he said that Jawaharlal Nehru is our leader
 baapu ne unhen apana uttaradhikari niyukt kiya he
 And they have also announced this
 baapu ke saare sainikon kaa farz he ki ve jawaharlal ji ke adeshon kaa puraa paalan karen
 i am not a disloyal soldier
 main jis sthaan par hum uske bare main mujhe kabhi vichaar bhi nahin aata tha
 i know enough that i am where i was kept
 dilli chhodkar jate hue sardaar patel ne gadgil se kyon kaha ki vaada karo, jawahar ko akelaa mat chhodana
 There were solid differences between the two but mutual respect was also strong
 maniben patel sardaar kii beti thim
 Dahyabhai Patel Vallabhbhai Patel was his son
 sardaar patel ke nidhan ke baad dahyabhai patel congress ke tikat par 1957 or 1962 main loksabhaa kaa chunaav jite
 Maniben was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1952 and 1957 on a Congress ticket and then went to the Rajya Sabha
 maniben ne apatkaal kaa virodh kiya or tab janata party ke tikat par mehsana se 1977 main chunaav jeet gayi
 Shesh Narayan Singh has given this information on his Facebook page
 yah jaankaree dete hue bhi dukh ho rahaa he ki ham itihaas ko kin chashmon se dekhne lage hai
 History is for understanding, not for accounting
 aaj indira gandhi kii punyathithi he
 Indira Gandhi was assassinated on the same day and followed by a massacre with the Sikhs
 ajeeb sa muqabla he
 Somewhere the Sardar is being magnified and somewhere Indira
 hode main likhaa ja rahaa he ki indira ne bhi pakistan ke do tukade kar die
 Did not bow before America
 pradhanmantri modi ne unhen twit ke zarie shradhanjali di he
 There is no mention of the riots of 84 in his tweet
 kaayade se donon pakshon ko maare gaye sikhon ko yaad karnaa chahie tha
 This would have made our politics bigger and not smaller
 kitna acha hota ki rahul gandhi bhi or narendra modi bhi naransahaar main maare gaye sikhon ko yaad karte, raajnneeti ko hinsa se dur rakhane ke liye aaj bhi kehete to pataa chalata ki hamaare netaa hinsa ko lekar baad main kitna acha sochate hai
 In these pictures, you see Congress leaders other than Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi
 rahul gandhi ne indira gandhi ko vyaktigat rup main or rajaneta ke rup main bhi yaad kiya he
 The Congress is accused of never carrying forward Patel's legacy
 congress ko sochna chahie ki us par yah aarope lagane kaa mauka kahaan se aayaa
 It is not that there are no institutions, airports, hospitals, or cities named after Patel
 phir bhi yah jawaab congress ko dena he ki vah patel ko lekar kyon asahaj rahi
 In the last four years, Congress leaders and activists have not been able to defend the outrageous attacks on Nehru
 patel kaa bachaav kya karenge
 Rahul Gandhi has tweeted that Sardar Patel was a patriot who fought for freedom, unity and secular India
 steel ke iraade vaale sardaar karunaa se bhare the, ve dil se congressi the, jinhone dharmandhta yaa sampradayakita ko kabhi bardaasht nahin kiya
 i salute this great son of India on his birth anniversary
 isi ke saath rahul kaa ek or twit he ki yah bhi vidambnaa he ki sardaar patel kii pratimaa kaa anaavaran ho rahaa he, lekin unhone jin sansthaanon ko banaaya ve sabhi dhahaae ja rahe hai
 Systematic fragmentation of India's institutions is nothing short of treason
 ekta kii pratimaa to ban gai, lekin aaj vaaki sardaar kii zarurat he
 When our politics goes into the debate of being a Hindu or not, being a real Hindu or being a fake Hindu, then it is time to search for the Sardar who has gone missing
 jo lohe kii tarah sampradayikta ke khilaaf the
 In 1941, when riots broke out in Ahmedabad, Sardar Patel said that what made you suddenly think that you started biting each other
 mujhe dukh is baat kaa he ki hamaari aabru chali gayi
 The name of the city of Ahmedabad was blurred
 kaise mitaayaa jaae ise
 The only way to erase it is to try to ensure that such an environment does not arise in this city again
 2002 main ahambadabad par phir se kalank laga tha
 Shouldn't everyone atone for the 84 and 2002 riots to this day? jab gandhi kii hatya hui tab grahamantri patel hi the
 He then banned the RSS
 balki apane mantralay ke adheen soochnaaon kaa hawala dete hue saaf-saaf kaha ki hatya ke baad sangh ke logon ne mithai banti thi
 On 11 September 1948, he wrote a letter to Patel's RSS sarsanghchalak MS Golwalkar that it is one thing to organize and help Hindus, but to take revenge on the helpless and innocent men, women and children for their suffering is another matter
 iske alaava ye bhi tha ki unke congress virodh ne, wo bhi is kathorta se ki na vyaktitv kaa khyaal, na sabhyataa kaa, na shishtataa kaa, janata main ek prakaar kii bechaini paidaa kar di
 All his speeches were full of communal poison
 hinduon main josh paidaa karnaa va unki raksha ke prabandh karne ke liye aavashwayak na tha ki zehar faile
 The result of this poison was in the end that the country had to bear the sacrifice of Gandhiji's priceless life
 sarkaar va janata kii ratti bhar sahanubhuti aresas ke saath na rahi, balki unke khilaaf ho gai
 The protest was further intensified by the joy expressed by the RSS people on Gandhiji's death and distributed sweets
 in halaat main sarkaar ko aresas ke khilaaf kadam uthaane ke alaava koi or rasta nahin bachaa tha
 People of the village around Sardar Sarovar Dam have raised questions about this statue
 72 gaanv ke logon ne kaha ki 31 aktubar ko pratimaa ke anaavaran ke virodh main upwas rakhenge
 The stove will remain closed
 22 gaanvon ke pradhanon ne pradhanmantri ko patr likhaa he ki yahaan ke jangalon, nadiyon, jalprapaaton, kheton ne sadiyon se hamaara khyaal rakhaa he
 We have been living around them, but now everything is being destroyed
 kya aapako nahin lagata ki yah kisi kii maut par jashn ke samaan he
 We think so only
 ham gaanv vaale bahut dukh ke saath kahana chaahate hai ki ham 31 aktubar ko aapkaa swaagat nahin karenge
 If you come like an uninvited guest, we will not welcome you
 agar sardaar patel ne dekha hota ki kaise prakritik sansadhano ko nasht kiya ja rahaa he, hamaare saath anyaay ho rahaa he to ve ro dete
 While we are raising our voice, your police is taking action
 aap hamaari takalifon ko sunne ke liye taiyaar kyon nahin hai
 But the Prime Minister has said that due to this statue, the tribal people around will get employment
 pradhanmantri ne yah bhi kaha ki yahaan ek aisi ekta nursery bane ki yahaan aane vaala tourist apane ghar ekta kaa paudha le jaae or boetippaniyan Now the examination is yours, you, the public
 tourist spot ban gaya he
 So this spot is not free
 aapako bhi ye na lage ki aap sardaar kaa darshan muft main kar rahe hai isliye online tikat kii vyavastha he
 There are two types of tickets
 3 saal ke bacchon ko tikat nahin lagegaa
 It will cost Rs 350 to see Observation Deck view, Valley of Flower, Memorial, Museum & Audio Visual Gallery, SOU site, Sardar Sarovar Dam
 agar aap Observation Deck view, nahin janaa chahenge to uske liye alag se package he
 Adult people will get 60 rupees tickets and children 60 rupees
 bas kaa charge he 30 rupaya
 In the case of tickets too, Sardar's statue has become expensive with many palaces, forts and buildings in India
 mahangi kahana thik nahin hoga, kahana chahie ki tikat ke daam bhi sabase oonche hai
 While the ticket for the Red Fort of Delhi is 35 rupees, the Taj Mahal is 50 rupees
 tajmahal dekhne ke liye har saal 70 se 80 lakh paryatak aate hai, jinamein se 8 lakh videshi paryatak hote hai videshi paryatakon ke liye 1100 rupye kaa tikat he
 The Taj Mahal earns 20 crores
 is samay jab sibiai ke do-do afasar ek duusare par mukadmaa karne ke kaaran daftar se baahar kar die gaye hai, tisare afasar par bhi aarope lag rahe hai, reserve bank of india apni swaittata ke liye sangharsh kar rahaa he, chunaav ayog par bhi sawaal uth ja rahe hai
 The Prime Minister is remembering the steel frame made by Patel
 jo sardaar sabake liye lade, us sardaar ke liye sab lard rahe hai
 Therefore the Sardar was the Sardar, there cannot be a Sardar fighting over him

 If you come like an uninvited guest, we will not welcome you

 While we are raising our voice, your police is taking action

 But the Prime Minister has said that due to this statue, the tribal people around will get employment
 pradhanmantri ne yah bhi kaha ki yahaan ek aisi ekta nursery bane ki yahaan aane vaala tourist apane ghar ekta kaa paudha le jaae or boetippaniyan Now the examination is yours, you, the public
 tourist spot ban gaya he
 So this spot is not free
 aapako bhi ye na lage ki aap sardaar kaa darshan muft main kar rahe hai isliye online tikat kii vyavastha he
 There are two types of tickets
 3 saal ke bacchon ko tikat nahin lagegaa
 It will cost Rs 350 to see Observation Deck view, Valley of Flower, Memorial, Museum & Audio Visual Gallery, SOU site, Sardar Sarovar Dam
 agar aap Observation Deck view, nahin janaa chahenge to uske liye alag se package he
 Adult people will get 60 rupees tickets and children 60 rupees
 bas kaa charge he 30 rupaya
 In the case of tickets too, Sardar's statue has become expensive with many palaces, forts and buildings in India
 mahangi kahana thik nahin hoga, kahana chahie ki tikat ke daam bhi sabase oonche hai
 While the ticket for the Red Fort of Delhi is 35 rupees, the Taj Mahal is 50 rupees
 tajmahal dekhne ke liye har saal 70 se 80 lakh paryatak aate hai, jinamein se 8 lakh videshi paryatak hote hai videshi paryatakon ke liye 1100 rupye kaa tikat he
 The Taj Mahal earns 20 crores
 is samay jab sibiai ke do-do afasar ek duusare par mukadmaa karne ke kaaran daftar se baahar kar die gaye hai, tisare afasar par bhi aarope lag rahe hai, reserve bank of india apni swaittata ke liye sangharsh kar rahaa he, chunaav ayog par bhi sawaal uth ja rahe hai
 The Prime Minister is remembering the steel frame made by Patel
 jo sardaar sabake liye lade, us sardaar ke liye sab lard rahe hai
 Therefore the Sardar was the Sardar, there cannot be a Sardar fighting over him
 aaj indira gandhi kii punyathithi he
 Indira Gandhi was assassinated on the same day and followed by a massacre with the Sikhs
 ajeeb sa muqabla he
 Somewhere the Sardar is being magnified and somewhere Indira
 hode main likhaa ja rahaa he ki indira ne bhi pakistan ke do tukade kar die
 Did not bow before America
 pradhanmantri modi ne unhen twit ke zarie shradhanjali di he
 There is no mention of the riots of 84 in his tweet
 kaayade se donon pakshon ko maare gaye sikhon ko yaad karnaa chahie tha
 This would have made our politics bigger and not smaller
 kitna acha hota ki rahul gandhi bhi or narendra modi bhi naransahaar main maare gaye sikhon ko yaad karte, raajnneeti ko hinsa se dur rakhane ke liye aaj bhi kehete to pataa chalata ki hamaare netaa hinsa ko lekar baad main kitna acha sochate hai
 In these pictures, you see Congress leaders other than Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi
 rahul gandhi ne indira gandhi ko vyaktigat rup main or rajaneta ke rup main bhi yaad kiya he
 The Congress is accused of never carrying forward Patel's legacy
 congress ko sochna chahie ki us par yah aarope lagane kaa mauka kahaan se aayaa
 It is not that there are no institutions, airports, hospitals, or cities named after Patel
 phir bhi yah jawaab congress ko dena he ki vah patel ko lekar kyon asahaj rahi
 In the last four years, Congress leaders and activists have not been able to defend the outrageous attacks on Nehru
 patel kaa bachaav kya karenge
 Rahul Gandhi has tweeted that Sardar Patel was a patriot who fought for freedom, unity and secular India
 steel ke iraade vaale sardaar karunaa se bhare the, ve dil se congressi the, jinhone dharmandhta yaa sampradayakita ko kabhi bardaasht nahin kiya
 i salute this great son of India on his birth anniversary
 isi ke saath rahul kaa ek or twit he ki yah bhi vidambnaa he ki sardaar patel kii pratimaa kaa anaavaran ho rahaa he, lekin unhone jin sansthaanon ko banaaya ve sabhi dhahaae ja rahe hai
 Systematic fragmentation of India's institutions is nothing short of treason
 ekta kii pratimaa to ban gai, lekin aaj vaaki sardaar kii zarurat he
 When our politics goes into the debate of being a Hindu or not, being a real Hindu or being a fake Hindu, then it is time to search for the Sardar who has gone missing
 jo lohe kii tarah sampradayikta ke khilaaf the
 In 1941, when riots broke out in Ahmedabad, Sardar Patel said that what made you suddenly think that you started biting each other
 mujhe dukh is baat kaa he ki hamaari aabru chali gayi
 The name of the city of Ahmedabad was blurred
 kaise mitaayaa jaae ise
 The only way to erase it is to try to ensure that such an environment does not arise in this city again
 2002 main ahambadabad par phir se kalank laga tha
 Shouldn't everyone atone for the 84 and 2002 riots to this day? jab gandhi kii hatya hui tab grahamantri patel hi the
 He then banned the RSS
 balki apane mantralay ke adheen soochnaaon kaa hawala dete hue saaf-saaf kaha ki hatya ke baad sangh ke logon ne mithai banti thi
 On 11 September 1948, he wrote a letter to Patel's RSS sarsanghchalak MS Golwalkar that it is one thing to organize and help Hindus, but to take revenge on the helpless and innocent men, women and children for their suffering is another matter
 iske alaava ye bhi tha ki unke congress virodh ne, wo bhi is kathorta se ki na vyaktitv kaa khyaal, na sabhyataa kaa, na shishtataa kaa, janata main ek prakaar kii bechaini paidaa kar di
 All his speeches were full of communal poison
 hinduon main josh paidaa karnaa va unki raksha ke prabandh karne ke liye aavashwayak na tha ki zehar faile
 The result of this poison was in the end that the country had to bear the sacrifice of Gandhiji's priceless life
 sarkaar va janata kii ratti bhar sahanubhuti aresas ke saath na rahi, balki unke khilaaf ho gai
 The protest was further intensified by the joy expressed by the RSS people on Gandhiji's death and distributed sweets
 in halaat main sarkaar ko aresas ke khilaaf kadam uthaane ke alaava koi or rasta nahin bachaa tha
 People of the village around Sardar Sarovar Dam have raised questions about this statue
 72 gaanv ke logon ne kaha ki 31 aktubar ko pratimaa ke anaavaran ke virodh main upwas rakhenge
 The stove will remain closed
 22 gaanvon ke pradhanon ne pradhanmantri ko patr likhaa he ki yahaan ke jangalon, nadiyon, jalprapaaton, kheton ne sadiyon se hamaara khyaal rakhaa he
 We have been living around them, but now everything is being destroyed

 The Prime Minister is remembering the steel frame made by Patel
 jo sardaar sabake liye lade, us sardaar ke liye sab lard rahe hai
 Therefore the Sardar was the Sardar, there cannot be a Sardar fighting over him
 congress par aarope lagata he ki usne patel kii viraasat ko kabhi aage nahin kiya
 Congress should think about where the opportunity to accuse him came from
 aisa nahin he ki patel ke naam par santhaan, airport, aspataal, yaa nagar nahin hai
 Still, the answer has to be given to the Congress as to why it remained uneasy about Patel
 pichley chaar saal main congress ke netaa or kaaryakarta nehru par hone vaale anaap shanaap hamalon kaa bhi bachaav nahin kar paae
 What will Patel defend? rahul gandhi ne twit kiya he ki sardaar patel rashtrabhakt the jinhone azaadi, ekta or secular bharat kii ladaai ladi
 Steele's intended chieftain was full of compassion, a heartfelt Congressman who never tolerated fanaticism or communalism
 unki janmashati par bharat ke is mahaan sapoot ko salaam karata hum
 With this, another tweet from Rahul is that it is also ironic that the statue of Sardar Patel is being unveiled, but the institutions he built are all being demolished
 bharat kii sansthaaon kaa vyavasthit rup se khandit kiya janaa deshdoh se kam nahin he
 The image of unity has been created, but today there is a need for Sardar
 jab hamaari raajnneeti hindu hone yaa na hone, asli hindu hone yaa nakli hindu hone kii bahes main chali jaae to yahi vakt he apane bheetar us sardaar ko khojane kaa jo kahin gum ho gaye hai
 Who were against communalism like iron
 1941 main jab ahmedabad main dange bhadak uthe tab sardaar patel ne kaha tha aapako ekaek yah kya soojha ki aap ek-duusare ke gale kaatane lage
 i am sad that our father left
 ahmedabad shahar ke naam par kalank lag gaya
 How to delete it
 ise mitaane kaa ek hi tarika he ki ham is baat kii koshish karen ki dubaara is shahar main aisa vaataavaran paidaa na ho
 In 2002, Ahmadabad was again stained
 kya aaj ke din 84 or 2002 ke dangon ke prati sabhi ko praayshchit nahin karnaa chahie tha
 When Gandhi was assassinated, it was Patel
 unhone tab aresas par pratibandh lagaaya
 Rather, citing information under his ministry, it was clear that the people of the Sangh had distributed sweets after the murder
 11 sitambar 1948 ko patel se aresas ke sarasanghachaalak em es golwalkar ko patr likhaa tha ki hinduon ko sangathit karnaa or unki sahaayta karnaa ek baat he, lekin apni takalifon ke liye besahaara or maasoom purushon, auraton or bacchon se badla lenaa bilkul duusari baat
 Apart from this, it was also that his Congress opposition, that too with the strictness that neither the care of personality, nor of civilization, nor of civility, created a kind of uneasiness in the public
 inke saare bhaashan sampradayik vish se bhare the
 It was not necessary to instill enthusiasm among the Hindus and to manage their defense that poison spread
 is zehar kaa fal ant main yahi hua ki gandhi ji kii amuly jaan kii qurbaani desh ko sahani padi
 The entire sympathy of the government and people was not with the RSS, but against them
 gandhi ji kii mrityu par aresas waalon ne jo harsh prakat kiya or mithai banti, usase yah virodh or bhi bad gaya
 In these circumstances, there was no other way for the government to take steps against the RSS
 is pratimaa ko lekar sardaar sarovar baandh ke aas paas ke gaanv ke logon ne sawaal uthaae hai
 People from 72 villages said that they would observe a fast in protest against the unveiling of the statue on 31 October
 chulhaa band rahegaa
 The heads of 22 villages have written a letter to the Prime Minister that the forests, rivers, waterfalls, fields here have taken care of us for centuries
 ham inhen ke aasare jite rahe hai, lekin ab sab nasht kiya ja rahaa he
 Don't you think it's like celebrating someone's death
 hamen to aisa hi lagata he
 We villagers want to say with great sadness that we will not welcome you on 31 October
 aap bin bulaae mehmaan kii tarah aaenge to ham aapkaa swaagat nahin karenge
 If Sardar Patel had seen how natural resources are being destroyed, injustice is being done to us, he would have cried
 jab ham apni awaz uthaa rahe hai, aapaki police karrwai kar rahi he
 Why are you not ready to listen to our problems? lekin pradhanmantri ne kaha he ki is pratimaa ke kaaran aas paas ke adivasee logon ko rojgaar milegaa
 The Prime Minister also said that such a unity nursery should be built here so that the tourist coming here should take the plant of unity to his home and sow comments
 ab imtahaan aapkaa he, aap yani janata kaa
 Has become a tourist spot
 isliye yah spot muft nahin he
 You also should not feel that you are visiting Sardar for free, so there is a system of online tickets
 do prakaar ke tikat hai
 3-year-olds will not get tickets
 Observation Deck view, Valley of Flower, Memorial, Museum & Audio Visual Gallery, SOU site, Sardar Sarovar Dam dekhne ke liye 350 rupee ke tikat lagenge
 If you do not want to go to Observation Deck view, then there is a separate package for that
 praudh logon ko 60 rupee kaa tikat lagegaa or bacchon ko 60 rupee
 The bus charge is 30 rupees
 tikat ke maamle main bhi sardaar kii pratimaa bharat ke kai mehalon, kilon or imaaraton se mahangi ho gai he
 It would not be right to say expensive, it should be said that ticket prices are also the highest
 jabaki dilli ke laal kile kaa tikat 35 rupaya he, tajmahal kaa 50 rupaya
 Every year 70 to 80 lakh tourists come to see Taj Mahal, out of which 8 lakh are foreign tourists, there is a ticket of 1100 rupees for foreign tourists
 tajmahal se 20 karod kii kamai hoti he
 At the moment when two CBI officers have been thrown out of office for suing each other, the third officer is also facing charges, the Reserve Bank of India is fighting for its autonomy, even on the Election Commission Questions are being raised
 pradhanmantri patel ke banaae hue steel frem ko yaad kar rahe hai
 The warlord who fought for everyone, everyone is fighting for that chieftain
 isliye sardaar sardaar the, unhen lekar ladane vaale sardaar nahin ho sakate hai
 Rahul Gandhi has tweeted that Sardar Patel was a patriot who fought for freedom, unity and secular India
 steel ke iraade vaale sardaar karunaa se bhare the, ve dil se congressi the, jinhone dharmandhta yaa sampradayakita ko kabhi bardaasht nahin kiya

 The deeds of Australian players have once again embarrassed cricket
 ve har baar kuch na kuch aisa kar dete hai jisase cricket kii duniya main unki hi fajihat hoti he
 Sometimes he has been flaunting the rules by insulting Harbhajan Singh, by inflicting the ball tampering on Sachin
 ab unhone ball se chhedchhad ke liye jo tarika apanaaya, ve behad hairaan karne vaala he
 In fact, Australian player Cameron Bancroft had pasted the tape in his hand, which turned him into reggae, with such a tape
 bancroft ne haath main tepe kaa chipakane vaala hissaa ulti taraf se lagaaya tha
 Bancroft then rubbed the tape onto the ground and pitch, so that the clay particles stick to the tape
 is tareeke se saamaanya sa dikhne vaala tepe regamar main badal jaataa tha
 After this this tape like tape was being rubbed into one part of the ball, so that the ball was damaged from one side and reverse swing could be achieved
 camere ne pakadi camran bancroft kii choricapatoun test main australia ne dakshin africa ko haraane ke liye ball tempring kaa gemplan banaaya tha, lekin camere ne unki chori pakad lee
 On the third day of the Cape Town Test against South Africa, the camera caught Australia's opener Cameron Bancroft hiding a tape in his pants
 is tepe ke jariye bancraft gend se chhedchhad kii koshish kar rahe the
 Bancroft had hidden it in his pants after screwing the ball with tape
 unhen laga ki unki ye harakat kisi ne nahin dekhi
 But the camera captured his action
 smith or bancroft ne kabuuli galateeis maamle kaa khulaasa hote hi maidani ampiron ne turant bancroft or captain smith ko talab kar liya
 The ball was examined
 gend main chhedchhad ke saboot to nahin mili, lekin captain smith or bancroft ne kabool kiya ki unki aisi manshaa jarur thi
 They are embarrassed by this and will not do it again
 team leadership ne kiya tha ball tempring kaa faisalahd to tab ho gai jab smith ne is tareeke se ball tempring ko team leadership kaa faisla bataaya or coach ko aaropon se bari kar diya
 Despite such a big incident, he refused to give up the captaincy, but given the stigma of dishonesty on Australian cricket from this incident, his captaincy will survive, this is a big question
 cricket australia ne puure maamle par jaanch bitha di he
 Smith left captaincy at the behest of the government The Australian captain Steve Smith, who was surrounded by the captainballball tampering controversy, had to relinquish the captaincy following the government order
 saath hi david warner ne bhi up-captain kaa pad chhod diya he
 Smith had earlier refused to give up the captaincy
 lekin australian sarkaar ke farmaan ke baad smith ko apana pad chhodana padaa he
 The innocence from which both players confessed their crime is that they did not have any idea that their actions not only brought Australian cricket into disrepute, but cricket has also been tarnished

 Gilad Shalit was born on August 28, 1986 in Israel to Noam and Aviva Shalit
 haalanki, yah sahi he ki isroyal ke pradhanmantri ke chote betewner netanyahoone 2014 main sena jwine kii thi

" sirf do samooh aise hai jin par anivaary sainik seva kii shart lagu nahin hoti, ve hai: ati-roodhiwaadee or arab israeli naagarik
 "so it is true that the Israeli Prime Minister's son served in the military, but the soldier seen in the viral picture is not the son of any Israeli Prime Minister

 purv bhartiya captain sunil gavaskar ne agle saal australia main hone vaale tii-20 world cap se pehle yuva wicketiper ballebaaj rishabh pant ko zyada se zyada maukey dene kii baat kahi he
 Gavaskar believes that given the World T20 next year, the time has come for Indian cricket to invest in youth
 bataa den ki rishabh pant philhal behad kharaab form se jujh rahe hai
 In the second T20 match played against South Africa in Mohali on Wednesday, Pant came out to bat at number 4 and was dismissed for just 4 runs
 pichley maheene westeindies daure par teen maichon kii tii-20 siries main rishabh pant ke balle se 69 ran aae the, to vahiin teen maichon kii vanade siries main bhi vah sirf 20 ran hi bana paae
 Rishabh Pant's biggest weakness is considered to be his shot selection
 pant aate hi bade or lambey shot lagane ke bare main sochate hai
 Rishabh Pant has been losing his wicket by playing inane shots many times
 kai baar unke saath aisa ho chukaa he
 However Rishabh Pant is Gavaskar's 'first choice' for next year's T20 World Cup
 gavaskar ne kaha, ‘hamen ab mahendra singh dhoni se aage dekhne kii jarurat he
 At least my team does not include Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 agar aap tii-20 world cap ke bare main baat kar rahe ho to main nishchit rup se rishabh pant ke bare main sochoongaa
 Gavaskar said that if Pant does not do well then Sanju Samson will be the next best option
 unhone kaha, ‘agar mujhe ek anya vikalp kii jarurat hogi to main sanju samson ke bare main sochoongaa kyonki sanju ek acha wicketiper or ek acha ballebaaj he
 "this great opener said," If i have to think about the T20 World Cup, then i will think about the youth because we need to think ahead
 dhoni ne bhartiya cricket ko acha yogadan diya he lekin ab usase aage ke bare main dekhne kaa samay aa gaya he
 Dhoni is yet to announce his international retirement, but the current selection committee has already indicated that he does not want to look back
 haalanki pant nirantar acha pradarshan nahin kar paa rahe hai or unke kharaab shot chayan se team ko nuksaan ho rahaa he jaisaa ki mukhya coach ravi shastri ne haal hi main kaha tha
 500 and 1000 rupee notes have been discontinued and now it is like a piece of paper for those who did not earn earnestly
 haalanki agle maheene tak ise bank main jamaa kara sakate hai
 There is a long queue outside the ATM for a 100 rupee note
 1000 rupee kaa note to hameshaa ke liye hua band ho gaya lekin 500 rupee kaa nayaa note aayega
 Apart from this, 2000 notes will also be seen in the market
 afvaahon par dhyaan na deshgar aapako whatsap par yaa massej main aisi jaankarimil rahi hai ki 2000 ke nae notemen naino jeepies chip (NGC) hoga to ye jaankaree bilkul galat he
 Neither the government nor the Reserve Bank of India has officially confirmed any such information
 piem modi ne kal ke apane bhaashan main aisi kisi bhi baat kaa zikr kiya
 Let me tell you that most of the GPS devices cannot be used indoors
 isliye aisa na to sambhav he or naa hi vyavhaarik he ki RBI ne sabhi 2000 ke noton main naino jeepies chip lagaaya he jiske jariye sabhi logon ko trek kiya ja sake
 This is also not possible because tracking people is like taking away their rights
 agar maan bhi len ki 2000 ke noton parjeepies divaais lagaai jaae to kya deshmen arabon khabaron noton ko real time nigaraanee kii ja sakati he? kya duniya ke kisi desh main aisa kiya gaya he? jawaab aap khud dhund sakate hai
 However, it is so important that new features have been given in the new note of 2000 rupees due to which it will be more secure than before and it will be difficult to fake it
 nae note kii color skim badal di gai he or is baar iskaa base color magenta hoga
 And its design is also very different from before
 ab 500 or 2000 ke note par devanagari main bhi likhaa hoga or mahatma gandhi kii photo ab bich main hogi
 The note of Mangalyaan will be on the back and the logo of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan
 in nae nots par RBI ke nae governor urjit patel ke hastakshar honge
 If you want any information related to the new note, it would be better to go to the website of Reserve Bank of India and read the detail
 haalanki kal raat se RBI kii website ruuk ruuk kar down ho rahi he or kai baar yah band bhi ho gai he

 supreme court ke aadesh ke baad rajasthan sarkaar ne neshnal haive par bane hotalon ke baar ko sij karnaa shuru kar diya he
 The Excise Department of Rajasthan has ordered that all liquor shops and hotels bars within 500 meters of the National Highway be closed, and their licenses will not be renewed either
 darasal rajasthan sarkaar ne state haive kaa naam badalakar urban road karke dukaanon or hotalon ke baar ko bachaa liya magar neshnal haive kaa naam badalane ke liye centre se parmishan kii zarurat hoti he, lihaaja yahaan par baar ko sij kiya ja rahaa he
 Three National Highways pass through Jaipur
 neshnal haive-8, neshnal haive-11 or neshnal haive-13 in teenon haive par shahari ilaaka he jahaan kai bade or five star hotel bane hai
 At the same time, the government had already notified the highway as Urban Road, but the area which does not come under the jurisdiction of Jaipur Municipal Corporation is being seized
 rajasthan sarkaar kaa aadesh milte hi aabkaari adhikari tok road par bane amber vila pales pahunche, jahaan sharaab ke stock ko hataakar baar ko sij kar diya gaya
 On this road, there is also the famous resort of Jaipur, Chokhi Dhani, where bars also closed
 rajasthan ke aabkaari adhikari niranjan arya kaa kahana he ki ye sab maharashtra, kerala or telangna jaise rajyon kii vajah se hua he, jo supreme court ke haive kinare sharaab kii dukaan band karne ke faisle ke rivyuu ke liye supreme court gaye the
 Earlier, the Supreme Court had given orders only on liquor shops but also included the hotel bar in the review petition
 aabkaari adhikari ke anusaar rajasthan main mahaj 15 fisadi sharaab kii dukaanon or hotalon par hin supreme court ke faisle kaa asar hoga
 But what will happen to big hotels like Lee Maradian, Fairmount, Chokhi Dhani who have invested crores
 darasal ye maamla 2007 se hin chal rahaa tha tab rajasthan sararkaar ne samajhadaari dikhaate hue teenon neshnal haive ke shahari hisse ko urban road banavaa liya tha isliye keval bahari ilaake main bane bade hotel hin iske chapet main aaenge
 Permission has to be taken from the Ministry of Transport, the erstwhile transport ministry of the Central Government, to make the National Highway an urban road, but the way there is an atmosphere against alcohol in the country
 rajya sarkaar centre se parmishan lekar supreme court kii naaraazgi nahi mol lenaa chaahati he
 However, according to sources, big hotels whose bars are closing can make their bar outside the radius of 500 meters

 In response to Pakistan's 316 for 4 in 50 overs, when Sri Lanka's score was 158 for 7 in the 34th over, match referee Javagal Srinath had to stop the game for half an hour
 darasal stadium main dakshini-purvi stand main darshakon ke do guton ke bich jhadap ho gai or isi jhadap ke dauraan maidan ke andar pathar phenkaa gaya
 According to Sri Lankan Cricket Board Secretary Prakash Schafter, "there was a clash between the two factions in the stand

 abhinetri aalia bhatta kaa kahana he ki kalakaaron ko har film main behatar pradarshan dene ke dabaav se guzarana padataa he, par vah in sabase asurakshit mahasoos nahin karatin
 Yes, she does get uncomfortable at times
 bollywood main 2012 main ai film 'student of da year' se kadam rakhane vaali abhinetri ne iske baad 'haive', 'tu-stats', 'hampati sharma kii dulhaniya', 'kapur and sans' or 'udata punjab' jaisi behtareen filmein kii
 His film 'fantastic', released last year, however, did not do anything special
 ek kalakaar ko mahasoos hone vaali asuraksha kii bhaavana ke bare main puche jane par aalia ne bataaya, "mujhe lagata he ki ek kalakaar par har film main behatar pradarshan dene kaa dabaav hota he, jisase aap apni sthiti ko lekar chintit ho jate hai
 i never feel insecure about all these things, but sometimes get uncomfortable
 " Alia, daughter of director Mahesh Bhatt and bygone actress Soni Razdan, says that when she feels uncomfortable, family support helps her come out of it
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) It was heard that when two lovers meet, there is a celebration in the sky, but what happens when two lovers are separated? i tell you what happens, the girl disappears for half the film and the boy goes on the path of destruction
 logon kii lakh minnaton ke baad bhi nahin sudharta or phir kuch aisa hota he ki aap apana sir pakadakar baith jate ho
 Talking about the film Kabir Singh, it is not bad, but Arjun Reddy's entire rip off
 matlab dialog bhi saim he bos
 This is the story of Kabir Rajvir Singh, who is studying at IIM and is the topper student there
 kabir padhai main bahut acha he, har field main top karata he, yahaan tak ki college ke footbal team kaa captain bhi he
 But Kabir has only one problem, he gets very angry
 jab maine bolaa bahut, matlab bahut zyada
 So much that he can kill someone
 phir ek din kabir kii jindagi main aati he priti, jo college ke first year students main se ek he
 Seeing the simplicity of Preity, Kabir falls in love with her, but later the two get separated and then the story of Kabir walking on the path of ruin
 ab kabir din raat sharaab peetaa he, ganje se lekar cocaine tak sabakuch karata he or hospital main bataur sarjan kaam kar rahaa he
 Preity does not leave her mind
 kisi or ke bare main sochna uski fitrat nahin he
 Talking about the acting performance of the actors, Shahid Kapoor is tremendous in the role of Kabir Singh
 ek ziddee, adiyal ladkaa, jo hameshaa gusse main rahata he
 Playing such a character is not an easy task
 ek sharaabi kaa role nibhaana usase bhi mushkil he or shahid ne ye kaam bahut hi saralata se kiya he
 Kiara Advani is good in Preity's role
 unhone priti ke kirdaar ko achche se nibhaayaa he or uski saadagi ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 In some scenes, Kiara even surprises you and you admire her work
 saporting role main kabir ke pita bane actor suresh oberoi, uske bhai ke role main arjan bajva, college ke dean main role main adil hossain or baaki actors ne bhi badhiya kaam kiya he
 But a person for whom a place will be made in your heart is that actor Soham Mazumdar in the role of Shiva, Kabir's friend! Soham has done an amazing job
 matlab insaan ko jindagi main dost mili to shiva jaisaa mili varanaa naa mili
 From studying with Kabir to trying to save and settle his life, Shiva does everything a good friend can do for you, but more than that
 shahid kapur or kiyaara adwani kii chemistry badhiya he
 Their love, their passion and madness in each other gets into your chest
 is film se ek baat to pakki he ki shahid kapur kii ye parformens aap aage aane vaale kai saalon tak yaad rakhane vaale hai
 How is Direction Director Sandeep Wanga made this film a scene to scene copy like Arjun Reddy, which makes me uncomfortable
 agar wo kabir singh ko arjuna reddy kii copy ke bajaae kuch alag tarah se banaate to shaayad ye or acchhee hoti
 However his direction is good and he has made this film well
 haa ye film thodi choti jarur ho sakati thi, kyonki iske ant tak pahunchate hue aap iske jald khatm hone kaa intjaar jarur karne lagate hai
 The music of the film is awesome! The music is composed by a team of Bollywood's best composers - Mithun, Amaal Malik, Vishal Mishra, sachet-parichay and Akhil Sachdev
 iskaa ek-ek gaanaa aapke dil me utarkar aapako bahut kuch mahasoos karwaata he
 Bekhali has already become a favorite of the people and after listening to it in the film you will hum it till the next day
 kyon dekhen filmahaalanki jaise duniya kii koi cheez parfect nahin hoti vaise hi kabir singh bhi ek parfect film nahin he
 The film has its shortcomings, which are difficult to ignore
 lekin iskaa malatab ye bilkul nahin he ki aapako ye film nahin dekhni chahie
 Shahid Kapoor's good acting, Kiara's simplicity, Soham's cares for Kabir and excellent music are important reasons to watch this film
 ab aage aapaki marji! There is a saying about Bangkok that if someone bounces a stone there, it is either a gambler or a broker
 agar is kahawat ko gudgaanv par feet kiya jaae, to kaha ja saktaa he ki pathar yaa to kisi spa chalaane vaale ko lagegaa yaa nite club vaale ko
 The sex business is flourishing in Gurgaon's spa centers and nightclubs

 These centers provide facilities like erotic massage to the customers
 yah sabakuch graahakon kii jeb or jarurat ke hisaab se parosa jaataa he
 The sex trade picks up a lot at night, especially after 9 pm
 club or spa chalaane vaale dallalon ko tainaat karke unke jariye graahakon ko fansaate hai
 Rates are determined after a lot of negotiation
 graahak jab ek baar club main daakhil ho jaataa he, to baar girl bhi khuleam rate bataane lagati he
 The charges range from Rs 300 to Rs 500 for 30 minutes
 baar girl shweta (badla hua naam) bataati he, 'yahaan paisa bananaa ekadam aasaan he
 We earn from 4 thousand to 5 thousand rupees every night, but up to 50 percent of the money has to be paid to the bar
 ' shweta ke mutabik, club kii zyaadaatar baar girl graahakon ko 'sexual sarvice' dene ko taiyaar rahati hai
 According to excise and income tax officials, there are more than 60 nightclubs in Gurgaon alone where the sex business runs
 verma se jab poocha gaya ki is tarah kaa likhit aavedan aane par kis tarah kii karrwai kaa praavdhaan he to unka kahana he ki yah baat prakritik ghatnaon se sambandhit he, lihaaja is par koi karrwai nahin kii ja sakati he

 muktada hasan nida fazli urdu or hindi ke aise fankaar the, jinaki shaayari vakt ke kaagaj par kuch is tarah vabsta he ki sadiyaan bhi ise dhundhala na kar paaengi
 He was born on 12 October 1938 in Delhi
 pita shaayar the, lihaaja bade bhai ke naam ke kaafiye se mila kar unka naam rakhaa gaya muktada hasan
 His childhood and adolescence were spent in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh
 padhai bhi vahiin hui
 Muktada Hasan started writing something since childhood
 nida fazli unka lekhkeey naam he
 Nida means swara i
e
 voice and fazli came from Fazila, the area of kashmir from which their ancestors came to Delhi
 phir bhi nida fazli ke urdu-hindi adab main puri tarah se aane kaa sabab ek haadasa bana
 It is said that when he was in college, he formed a one-sided, unknown, abola relationship with a girl sitting on his front seat
 vah aajkal kaa daur nahin tha, jahaan izhaare muhabbat bhi bina kisi sharmohaya ke ho jaataa he
 At that time, all the restrictions were imposed on Kishorevay
 bhaawanaaon kaa ufaan saamaajik bandhanon kii dahleez ko itani aasaani se na laangh paata
 In a similar mood, the sprout of the courtyard of Hassan's mind would blossom as if a bomb exploded on the notice board of the college
 angreji main notice board par jo likhaa tha, uskaa hindi tarjuma kuch yon tha, 'kumari tandon kaa accident ho gaya he, or ab unka dehanth ho gaya
 Nida was shaken by this news, became sad
 par apane is dukh ke izhaar ke liye unke paas sahi shabd salika na tha
 He realizes that whatever he is writing, he is unable to express this sorrow
 kaaphi jaddojehad ke baad ek baat unhen samaj ai ki dosha shabdon main nahin likhane ke tareeke main he
 There is nothing in what he is writing so that the cloak of sorrow is opened inside him
 kehete hai ek din subah jab vah ek mandir ke paas se guzar rahe the to kisi ko surdaas kaa yah mashhoor bhajan 'madhuban tum kat rahat hare? birh biyog syam sundar ke thaadhe kyon na jare?' gaate hue suna
 Just what then? Mukhtada felt that the clutches of sorrow were opening inside him
 iske baad to un par kabirdaas, tulsidas, surdaas, baba farid aadi bhaktikalin kaviyon ko padhane kaa junun sa savaar ho gaya
 He spread the Dohavalis, Bhajans, Kirtans, Lokarchanas of the worshipers of all Sufi saints, Sagun, Nirgun Brahm
 vah inhen jitna adhik padhate jate, is nattejey par pahunchate jate ki in kaviyon kii sidhi-saadi, bina laag lapet kii, do-took bhashaa main likhi rachanaaen adhik prabhavakaari hai
 Surdas's' Udho, do not mind ten to twenty
 ek huto so gayu syam sang, ko aradhai te is', yaa phir mirza gaalib kii 'dil-e-nadaan tuje hua kya he? aakhir is dard kii dawa kya he?' bas phir kya tha, swadhyay kii yah yatra muktada hasan ko nida fazli jaise mahaan shaayar ke rup main badalane main safal rahi
 See the hallmark - God is silent! If you come, you can be alone in the world
 i cannot do so many things alone
 Simple language has always become my own style of fun
 hindu-muslim qaumi dangon se tang aa kar unke mata-pita jab pakistan ja kar bas gaye, tab bhi nida yaheen bharat main rahe
 He wandered in many cities in search of income
 par kaam kahaan miltaa
 The writing went on, but Kismet had written something else for Nida
 vahatu is tarah se miri zindagi main shaamil haijahan bhi jaaon ye lagata he teri mehafil he
 
 
 
 jaisi nazmon tak aise hi nahin pahunche the
 Bhopal, Allahabad, Delhi and not Mumbai was the bastion of Hindi and Urdu literature
 saal 1964 main nida kaam kii talash main mumbai pahunch gaye
 He started writing articles in newspapers and magazines like Dharmyuga, Blitz, Sarika
 jald hi chhapane bhi lage
 His simple and impressive writing style soon brought him respect and fame
 uske baad to itihaas he
 He could have written this: Deva hai koi hum mainta kochi chhoo ki dekhe hai ki desh ki hoon hai ki khir ki khilai ki jaar varn xxrep 5 a di ami ki jaad ki khoola ki nahi hanida fazli's famous books compilation 'lafzon ki phool', 'peacock dance', ' The eyes and dreams of the sun, 'the lost little thing', 'eyes full of sky' and 'there will be sunshine in the journey'; Autobiography 'between the Walls', 'outside the Walls'; Memoirs include 'visits', 'sunny to the journey', 'tamasha mere next'
 unhone kuch behad umdaa shaayaron par likhi pustakon kaa sampadan bhi kiya
 These include 'bashir Badr: a name for the new Ghazal', 'jannisar Akhtar: a young death', 'daag Dehalvi: a school of Ghazal', 'muhammad Alvi: Painter of words', 'jigar Muradabadi: Poet of Muhabbat' are
 lekhan ke liye vah sahitya academy puraskaar, kaumi ekta puraskaar, madhyapradesh sarkaar ke mir taki mir puraskaar, khusro puraskaar, maharashtra urdu academy puraskaar, bihar urdu academy puraskaar, uttar pradesh urdu academy puraskaar, hindi urdu sangam puraskaar jaise kai sammaan se navaaje ja chuke the
 He also received many other awards, including screen, for the film song
 bataur shaayar or geetkaar nida fazli kaa safar kitna shandaar or shairana tha yah unke geeton, gazalon, shaayari ko sunakar hi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 It is said that when Kamal Amrohi was making the film Razia Sultan, the responsibility of writing the song was on Jannisar Akhtar
 achaanak jannisar kaa nidhan ho gaya
 Jannisar Akhtar was also from Gwalior and referred to Nama as Kamal Amrohi as a 100 percent pure Urdu speaker
 kamaal amrohi ne jannisar akhtar kii baat kaa maan rakhte hue nida fazli se sampark kiya or unhen film ke baaki bache do gane likhane ko kaha
 
 
 And then Nida composed what song
 ye donon gane the, pehla-'tera hijr meraa naseeb hatera gam hi meri hayaat he,mujhe teri duuri kaa gam ho kyontu kahin bhi ho mere saath he
 
 
 'and the second song was -' Zhanjir ki jhankar khuda khaare khaare, dil hua kya girrahar kharat khaare khaare khoon hai, who knows this who touches my soul, a doom khodar khud khade khoon khuda khoon kar khuda ko khida khida khon kare khida ke 
 
 'or is tarah itane shandaar gaanon se unke filmi geet lekhan kii shuruyaat hui
 He then wrote songs for several films
 aisi filmon main 'sarfarosh', 'aahista-aahista', 'is raat kii subah nahin', 'sur' aadi shaamil he
 He was opposed to the fanaticism of both Hindus or Muslims
 bhartiya sahitya main badhati chatukaarita or charanwad kaa virodh karne ke liye vah lambey samay samay tak sthapit sahityakaron ke nishane par rahe
 In his book 'mulaqatane' he fearlessly exposed the courtly tendency of Indian writing, which also led to boycott
 isi tarah apane likhe is sher-'ghar se masjid he badi dur, chalo ye kar lenkisi rote hue bachche ko hansaaya jaae,'ke liye vah kattarpanthi musalamaanon kaa nishaanaa ban gaye
 The situation was that when he went to Pakistan to join a Mushaira, radical mullahs surrounded him there
 mullaon ne apana virodh prakat karte hue poocha ki kya nida fazli kisi bachche ko allaah se bada samajhate hai? nida kaa uttar tha ki mujhe keval itnaa pataa he ki masjid insaan ke haath banaate hai, jabaki bachche ko allaah apane haathon se banaata he
 This special poet dedicated to hindi-urdu entered the world on 8 February 2016
 kaash, 'aadmi kii talash' sheershak vaali apni nazm kii shuruaati in do panktiyon kii tarah-abhi mara nahin zindaa he aadmi shaayadyaheen kahin use dhundho yaheen kahin hogaaki tarah dhundne par vah mil jate

 During the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, the 'UP boys' SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and Congress President Rahul Gandhi contested the elections together but the result did not come in favor
 bijepi ne baari bahumat ke saath soobe kii satta hasil kii
 a year later, the elephant-bicycle pair came together in Gorakhpur and Phulpur, then the SP-BSP wavered in the BJP stronghold
 yani upi kaa raajnneetik sanket saaf he sapa-basapa kaa saath pasand he lekin congress utani asardaar nahin he
 Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati have now started to understand the same sign and both the leaders have started cutting off Kanni from the main opposition party of the country led by Rahul Gandhi
 sutron kaa kahana he ki akhilesh yadav upi chunaav main party kii durgati ke liye congress ke saath ko hi jimmedaar maanate hai
 He also believes that Congress cannot be given any other seat apart from Rae Bareli and Amethi
 beete loksabhaa chunaav main congress inhen do paaramparik siton par chunaav jeet pai thi
 During that time, the 'SP family' had won 5 seats, while the BSP had become clean
 agar congress ke saath sapa-basapa kaa gathbandhan hua to in donon dalon ko panje ke liye kai siten chhodani padengi, jo ki in donon main se koi dal nahin chahta
 BSPBSP chief Mayawati has already indicated that she is not in the mood to compromise many seats despite having an alliance
 80 siton vaale upi main mayawati 40 siton par apni swaabhaavik daavedaari maanakar chal rahi hai
 At the time of sitting at the table of agreement for the coalition, they may also give some softening and leave four to five seats but the BSP will not accept it at all
 aise main congress ke liye chodi jane vaali siten kahaan se aaengi
 Akhilesh is ready to sacrifice, but how much? Akhilesh Yadav has said publicly that he will show a big heart and will give up some seats if necessary for the alliance, but how much 'some' it will be is not clear
 aise samay main jab centre main gaiyr bijepi-gaiyr congressi pradhanmantri banane ke bhi kuch asaar hon, koi bhi kshetreey dal ek seemaa se zyada nahin jhukegaa
 Akhilesh's SP is no different
 iske alaava nurpur main jis tarah se sapa or basapa ne areldi ke liye maidan khaali kar diya, usase areldi bhi is gathbandhan main judane or kuch siton par daawa thonkane ko taiyaar baithi he
 In this way, there is only a few seats left for the Congress in the distribution of seats, on which the party does not seem to agree
 mana ja rahaa he ki siton kii isi kashmakash ko bhaanpate hue akhilesh yadav or mayawati ab congress par dabaav banane main jute gaye hai
 Both parties do not want Congress to be given such a sense that it can demand more seats for itself in the alliance
 yahi vajah he ki donon netaaon ne rahul gandhi ko jhatka dena aarambh kar diya he
 Mayawati caught hold of separate Rahamayawati has decided to contest separately in Madhya Pradesh by throwing water on the intentions of the Congress alliance

 According to sources close to Akhilesh Yadav, the national president of Fistaspa, Akhilesh also said that the party wants to give only two seats to the Congress out of 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 is babat gathbandhan ke duusare dalon se charchaa karne ke liye mangalvaar ko akhilesh yadav dilli pahunch rahe hai
 Sources say that in the Lok Sabha elections, the Samajwadi Party wants to give only Amethi and Rae Bareli seats to the Congress
 sapa isse ek bhi seat zyada congress ko nahin dena chaahati he
 In this regard, the SP is also planning to propose to the Congress

 party ke saamne sabase badi chunauti loksabhaa chunaavon main jeet kii he, lekin vidhansabha chunaavon main mili haar ko dekhte hue aisa anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa he ki upie ke liye teesri baar satta main lautne kii raah aasaan nahin hogi

 bollywood abhinayta sanjay dutt ko lekar mumbai kii arthur road jail ko ek khat mila he
 Sanjay Dutt is threatened in this letter
 jail prashasan ne is khat ke baad unki suraksha kii pukhta guarantee dene kaa vaada kiya he
 It is worth noting that Sanjay Dutt had declared his life as a threat on Tuesday and had filed a petition in the TADA cart and demanded to be surrendered directly to Yerwada Jail in Pune
 haalanki unhone buudhvaar apni yachika waapas le lee
 Now Sanjay Dutt will surrender in TADA court instead of jail

 At the same time, after getting the threatening letter, the question is, who wants to kill Sanjay Dutt? The petition in which Sanjay Dutt spoke about the danger of leaving
 
 
 sanjay dutt ko adaalat main sarender karne se dar lag rahaa he
 His lawyers had filed a plea in the TADA court giving two arguments
 daleel number 1-sanjay dutt ko kattarpanthi takaton se apni jaan par khatra mahasoos ho rahaa he
 Argument number 2 - They do not want the media cameras to chase them until they are taken from court to jail and an accident happens
 pichhali baar jab sanju baba jab giraftaar hue the to media unke peeche lag gai thi
 Because of this, he had to drive away at a speed of 120 km
 gauratlab he ki 1993 mumbai blast ko lekar 21 march ko arms act (gaiyrkanoonee rup se hathiyaar rakhane ke liye) ke tahat sanjay dutt kii sajaa barkaraar rakhane kaa faisla sunaaya tha

 Following this decision, the Bollywood actor filed a petition in the Supreme Court requesting surrender after he finished shooting his films, after which the court granted him 4 weeks to surrender

 What is the matter? Sanjay Dutt was convicted by the TADA court for unlawfully possessing a nine mm pistol and an AK 56 rifle
 ye hathiyaar unheen visphotak saamagree or hathiyaaron kii khep kaa hissaa the, jinka istemaal mumbai bam dhamaakon main kiya gaya tha
 In these blasts, 257 people were killed and more than 700 were injured

 In Jharkhand, the case of Patthalgadi has been catching on
 mukhyamantri raghuvar das ne kaha he ki patthalgadi kii aad main opium kii avaidh kheti kii ja rahi he
 All these anti-national forces are giving protection
 bataa den ki jharkhand main khunti or gumla jile ke adivasee bahul gaavon main in dinon patthalgadi kaa kaarykram kaaphi tej gati se ho rahaa he
 It prohibits entry of police or administrative officers into the village without permission of the gram sabha

 saath hi ve patthalgadi kaa sahaara lekar adivaasiyon or gaanv waalon ko desh or rajya sarkaar ke khilaaf bhadakaane main jute hue hai
 Chief Minister Raghuvar Daska believes that the development of the village is being affected due to Pathalgadi
 haalanki raghuvar das ne kaha he ki sarkaar raashtra-virdohi takaton dwaara chalaae ja rahe is kaarykram ko kisi bhi surat main rahane nahin degi
 It is worth noting that reports of forcible hostage of police personnel who went on raids in the village for the last few days are constantly being reported
 adivaasiyon kii puraani parampara he patthalgadipahle adivasee iskaa upyog avaanchit logon ko gaanv ke andar ghusane se rokane ke liye kiya karte the, lekin beete kuch saalon se isamen kaaphi teji ai he
 It is said that the Patthalgadi that is happening in the Khunti and Bandgaon region is different from the Pathalgadi of Sarna society
 darasal patthalgadi karne vaale nahin chaahate ki unke gaanv main bahari log aaen
 Pathalgadi is a tradition of tribal society
 iske tahat se gaanv kaa simakan kiya jaataa he, lekin ab isi kii aad main indinon gaanv ke baahar avaidh dhang se patthalgadi kii ja rahi he
 Villagers are being instigated for the movement by misinterpreting the articles of Indian constitution which give the right of Gram Sabha on the stone

 ’’ unhone chihn dikhaaya nahin tha
 At the same time, the district administration says that they have sent the report to the Election Commission
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ajay raay ko chunaav ayog ne notice jari kar diya he
 It is noteworthy that after voting on Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, the Election Commission ordered the registration of an FIR for showing election symbols to media persons
 gauralatab yah ki ahmedabad seat par narendra modi keval voter hai or is seat se party ummidavaar laalkrishna adwani chunaav maidan main hai

 All eyes are now on the Election Commission

 mahatma gandhi rashtriya gramin rojgaar guarantee yojana ( MGNREGA yaa manaregaa) ko kabhi ‘upie sarkaar kii vifaltaa kaa smarak' bataane vaali maujuuda sarkaar ne is saal ke bajet main uske liye sabase zyada 60,000 karod rupee kaa aavanton kiya he
 Despite this, the wages of the people working under the MNREGA are very low and year after year the growth in it is like that of cumin in the camel's mouth
 chunavi saal main bhi kuch khaas badhat nahinis saal 28 march ko gramin vikaas mantralay ne 34 rajyon or centre shasit pradeshon ke liye manaregaa kii mazdooree main sanshodhan kii adhisuchana jari kii
 But the amazing thing is that even the slightest increase in this election year is surprising and disappointing
 udhaaharan ke liye chah rajyon or centre shasit pradeshon main manaregaa kii mazdooree main ek rupee kii badhat bhi nahin kii gai (vahi mazdooree barkaraar rakhi gai jo 2018 main thi)
 These include Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, West Bengal, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep
 do rajyon himachal pradesh or punjab main 2018 kii tulana main mazdooree main mahaj 1 rupee kii badhat kii gai
 Similarly, wages in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh were increased by just Rs 2
 sirf 6 rajyon main mazdooree main 10 se 17 rupee (jo ki adhiktam he) kii badhat kii gai
 These are the states of the Northeast - Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura
 kam se kam 2016 se (jab se aadhikarik website par aankade maujuud hai) manaregaa kii mazdooree main aisi hi badhat dekhi ja rahi he
 In the year 2018, MNREGA wages were not increased by one rupee in 10 states
 ye rajya the- arunachal pradesh, bihar, jharkhand, mizoram, nagaland, rajasthan, sikkim, tripura, upi or uttarakhand
 In six states and union territories, the wages of MNREGA were increased by just Rs 2
 inamen chhattisgarh, gujarat, madhya pradesh, maharashtra, daadaraa evam nagar haveli or daman div shaamil the
 In just 11 states and union territories, wages were increased by Rs 8 or more (maximum Rs 19 in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry)
 saal 2017 main bhi paanch rajyon main manaregaa kii mazdooree main mahaj 1 rupee kii badhat kii gai thi
 These include Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, UP and Uttarakhand
 tab 11 rajyon or centre shasit pradeshon main mazdooree main badhat mahaj 8 rupee yaa usase zyada kii badhat gai thi (adhiktam badhat 18 rupee kii thi)
 Increasing problems in rural areas The people of rural areas are equally disturbed, their problems are increasing, but there is no public statement about why this fun is happening with MNREGA wages
 centre for monitering indian iconomi (siemii) ke mutabik saal 2015-16 se ab tak gramin ilaakon main mazdooron ko milane vaale paarishramik main bahut kam, ek ank main hi badhat ho pai he
 How disturbed the people of rural areas are can be gauged from the extraordinary increase in the workday of laborers in 2018-19
 aadhikarik aankadon ke mutabik 2018-19 main 266
 4 crore persons working day data was recorded
 jo endie sarkaar ke satta main aane ke baad se ab tak kaa sarvaadhik he
 166 in the year 2014-15
 21 karod vyakti kaary diwas kaa aankada tha
 One thing that worries about the NREGA even beyond the minimum wage is that the wages available in it are less than the minimum wages fixed in the states
 manaregaa sangharsh samiti ke liye kai enjio dwaara kiye gaye ek vishleshan se pataa chalaa he ki 33 pradeshon or centre shasit pradeshon main manaregaa ke tahat milane vaali mazdooree us rajya main tay nunatam mazdooree se bhi kam he
 This is the situation when the Supreme Court has clearly ordered in 1983 Sanjit Roy v
 Rajasthan that the remuneration received in all such schemes should not be less than the fixed minimum wages
 pichley chaar saal se tamaam saamaajik kaaryakarta manaregaa ke tahat kam se kam tay nunatam mazdooree ko lagu karne ke liye sangharsh kar rahe hai, lekin unke is sangharsh kaa abhi tak koi nateeja nahin niklaa he

 Chidambaram said that such a 'timetable' should be implemented, which would enable the party to play the role of the true opposition at a time when the morale of the party workers has dropped considerably
 chidambaram ne yah bhi kaha ki sarkaar ke saamne ek kargar, majboot or thos vipaksh pesh karne ke liye party ke punargathan kaa bada kaam pending he
 He said that Congress President Sonia Gandhi is number one in the organization

 On questions related to the demand for Priyanka Gandhi in a section of the party, Chidambaram requested the Congress president and the vice president to be more vocal
 unhone kaha, 'main unase anurodh karuunga ki ve or zyada reliyon ko sambodhit karen, unase anurodh karuunga ki media se milen
 In an interview, Chidambaram said, 'I agree that the morale of Congress workers is very low

 Sachin Pilot has finally emerged
 ’purv vitt mantri ne is baat ko khaarij kiya ki party netritv party kaaryakartaaon tak se baat nahin kar rahaa he
 He said, 'this is not right
 main unase niyamit antaraal par miltaa hum
 They talk to us and i believe that there are others
 main unase anurodh karuunga ki ve janata se baat karen
 Asked if he was disappointed with the fact that Sonia left her place and left it for her son, Chidambaram said that this question should be asked to him
 lekin main samajhataa hum ki upaadhyaksh ke pad kaa srijan or is pad par rahul gandhi ko baithaaya janaa netritv kii agali peedi ko kaman saunpane kii ek sochi-samajhi ranneeti thi
 Chidambaram said, 'this is happening at every level and i do not think there is a mistake in it
 main samajhataa hum ki jaipur kaa faisla sambhavat: sahi nirnay tha, jiskaa puure utsaah se na sirf party ke andar balki party se baahar ke logon dwaara bhi swaagat kiya gaya
 On the issue of leadership, he said, "the most acceptable leader of my generation is Sonia Gandhi and i understand that there is a wide acceptance of Rahul Gandhi among the younger members of the party
" iskaa yah matlab nahin ki duusare netaa ubhar nahin sakate yaa nahin ubharna chahie
 The Congress leader also rejected Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's remark that the Congress may be embarrassed by the disclosure of the names of the black money account holders
 chidambaram ne kaha, ‘yah vyaktigat len-dein he, kanoon kaa vyaktigat ulanghan he
 The person should be ashamed
 party ko kyon sharminda hona chahie

 bihar main baadh ke vahi 2008 jaise halaat hai
 Once again the Gujarat check of five crores is proposed to help the flood affected areas of the state
 gujarat main vahi bijepi sarkaar he
 Sitting on the throne of power in Bihar is the same CM Nitish Kumar, who at that time turned down help, but this time he is not in the mood to return five crores
 bihar ke badhgrast ilaakon kii madad ke liye gujarat ke mukhyamantri vijay roopaani sarkaar ke rajasav mantri bhoopendra si chudsama patna main bihar ke siem nitish kumaar ko 5 karod kaa check denge
 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi will also be present on this occasion
 yah 5 karod rupee bihar main baadh peediton kii sahaayta ke liye mukhyamantri raahat kosh main jayega
 Floods have caused massive destruction in Bihar this year
 vakt badla or halaat badale to dilon main baithi mile bhi dur ho gai
 Nitish Kumar has forgotten all political politics and become friends with PM Narendra Modi
 nitish kumaar bijepi ke sahyog se phir bihar kii satta par virajman hai
 In such a way, how can he return the help of Gujarat
 jabaki ek samay tha jab narendra modi kii parchaai se bhi nitish kumaar parhez karne lage the
 In this affair, Modi extended his hand for help, but he did not accept it either
 darasal 2008 main bihar ke kosi nadi kaa baandh tut jane kii vajah se kosi ilaake main baari tabaahi hui thi
 In such a situation, in 2008, Gujarat government sent 5 crore help
 us samay gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi the
 But in 2010, the BJP national executive meeting was being held in Patna
 usee dauraan kuch utsaahi bijepi ke kaaryakartaaon ne patna main poster laga diya tha ki gujarat ne bihar ko5 karod kii madadki thi
 Angered by this, the Chief Minister had returned the money from Gujarat and also canceled the banquet at the Chief Minister's residence in honor of the BJP leaders
 bihar phir usee 2008 kii halaat par aakar khadaa he
 The flood situation is the same and a check of Rs five crore has come out from the Gujarat government for help
 aise main ek baar phir gujarat ke is madad se raajnneeti sugabugane lagi he
 Nitish Kumar recently formed a government with the BJP in Bihar and after that he has joined the NDA once again
 2008 ke baad 2017 main gujarat se madad mil rahi he haalanki is dauraan koi badi baadh bhi nahin ai
 This is the reason why Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi says that there is no benefit from remembering old things
 unhone kaha bihar main is saal bhayanak baadh ko dekhte hue kai rajyon ne madad di he
 Not only Gujarat, states like Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh are helping

 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main vah ek baar phir congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko amethi main kadi takkar de rahi hai
 After returning from vacation, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, who is trying to surround the Modi government on every front, is now reminded of his parliamentary constituency
 guuruuvaar ko rahul gandhi loksabhaa main amethi ke mega food park kaa mudda uthaaya
 The Congress Vice President in the Lok Sabha said that PM Modi has broken the promise made to farmers

 He said that the food park was a fight for the rights of the farmers, but the government ignored it
 rahul ne aarope lagayaaki piem modi badale kii raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 Potatoes are purchased from farmers for 2 rupees and are sold for 10 rupees
 joki unke saath anyaay he
 At the same time, on Rahul Gandhi's allegations, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that he would personally investigate the matter and give an answer
 sarkaar kisaanon ke hit main kaam kar rahi he
 He responded by targeting Rahul and said that Rahul does not understand farming

 masalan, mumbai main bahutayat main videshi veshyaayein uplabdh hai or shahar ke 27 pratishat log unke paas ja chuke hai
 Law does not become an obstacle in this
 isliye bhi yah yonkriya kaa 'surakshit tarika' ban gaya he
 Foreign prostitutes are aware of AIDS and sex-related diseases, so they take full care to make it healthy, enjoyable and do not participate in sex without a condom
 duusari taraf, kai log condom ke istemaal ko bekaar maanate hai
 Male prostitutes are earning more
 However, India's prostitution industry is running well with an annual turnover of Rs 2,000 crore
 kaa bataaya jaataa he
 a big revelation is also that male prostitutes are earning more than women
 mahanagaron main aisi mahilaon kii sankhya din-ba-din badhati ja rahi he jo purush veshyaaon ko kiraye par rakh leti hai yaa uski sweekruti detii hai
 Such women were found 17 percent in Mumbai, 15 percent in Delhi, 13 percent in Kolkata
 bangaloru main videshi purush veshyaaon (jigolo) kii kaaphi maang he
 62 percent of the women who hire them there prefer foreigners
 isaki vajah yah he ki bharat kii 40 pratishat pravasi aabaadi yaheen rahati he or yahaan kuch kaamkaaji mahilaayein apane ko bahut akeli paa sakati hai
 If you have money, then you have the strength, but where the women and men of the country are buying sex, there are still many loopholes in this area
 itipie na to sex work or na hi sex workaron ko aparaadh kii shrenee main rakhata he, lekin 'saarvajanik sthal' main yonkriya ko gaiyrkanoonee maanata he

 adhinium main 2005 ke prastaavit sanshodhan kaa to or adhik virodh kiya ja rahaa he
 In this amendment, there is a provision for arresting the customer in place of sex worker and imprisonment for three years
 lekin ek sidhaa-sada tark yah ho saktaa he ki yadi paise ke evaj main sex kai roopon main uplabdh he, to is tarah ke sex par pabandi kyon? kuch bhi ho, kanoon se veshyavriti par ankush lagata nahin dikhataa, vah nae aavaran main bikne lagata he
 If you can get behind the lessons by having sex with sex workers, then you can take a safe way to watch pornography on the Internet
 lekin yadi paise ke evaj main sex hasil karne kaa vikalp nahin he, to anya vikalpon par vichaar kiijie
 Pick up the phone or pick up a porn magazine wrapped in a jacket
 yaa chupchaap sthaneey vedia parlor main chale jaaie
 If you have money then you have strength

 Four hundred fifty six picks in fake profiles

 ek haar se fark nahin padataa
 Even a person can become a minister by losing
 degree nahin to kya lipikeey truti he
 Who can stop the one moving forward
 shabdkosh main arth badalte hai, bade logon kii galtiyaan lipikeey truti kehalaati hai, baaki ke aparaadh
 Children learn what they see
 bacchon main bhi ab utsaah he
 Those are the six new iims to be opened
 unhen mat kholie
 We will read from the IIN itself
 bas ek degree kaa intjaam kar dijie, wo bhi na ho sake to vakt-zarurat pade har kisi ke liye ek lipikeey truti hi maaf rakhie

 lekin sabase ajeeb baat ye hui ki jab apane saath hue haadase ke bare main logon ko bataaya to sabhi ne april phool samajhakar yakeen hi nahin kiya
 It happened that Tanaz and Bakhtiar's house was set on fire on April 1, but the other members of the family were seen laughing instead of sharing pain as they mocked April Fool
 bombai times se baatcheet main actress tanaj ne bataaya ki bakhtyar or main kamare main so rahe the
 Then a loud scream was heard from a person working in the house in the children's room
 maine bakhtyar ko kaha dekho kya hua, jab wo dekhakar lautaa to uski haalat kharaab thi
 Bakhtiar is not a quick-panic person, but both me and Bakhtiar were shocked after seeing the fire
 View this post on instagramhappy Valentine Day Spread love all around today and always

 Tanaz told that when we told the family members and friends about this incident, they could not believe it
 sabhi ko pehali baar main yahi laga ki ham april phool bana rahe hai
 But when he came to know that this is not an April Fool, then he was shocked

 Here, everything is not looking well in the bjp-shiv Sena alliance
 shivasena adhyaksh uddhav thakare ne shanivaar ko ek bayaan dekar yah jaahir kar diya ki wo gathbandhan main kisi bhi mudde par peeche hatane vaale nahin hai

 thakare ne kaha, 'agar yah gathbandhan aage badhata he to ham peeth par waar nahin karenge
 
 ham khul kar apni baat rakhenge

 Last date for application - 26 February 2018 rajyasabha ko lekar vittamantri arun jetali ne ek gambhir sawaal uthaa diya he
 At the end of the budget session, he told journalists that i can understand that in the system of two houses, sometimes the indirectly elected house can question the discretion of the directly elected house
 yah kabhi-kabhaar ho saktaa he, lekin bill dar bill nahin, satr dar satr nahin ho saktaa
 In parliamentary democracy, it is a serious question whether bill by bill can indirectly challenge the decision of the elected house
 mujhe jetali ke is sawaal par hairaani nahin hui
 There has been a lot of debate on this issue in the Constituent Assembly, but first their discomfort must be understood
 shuru se hi modi sarkaar rajyasabha main bahumat na hone ko lekar rekhaankit karti rahi he
 Recently, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that there is no majority in the Rajya Sabha, hence Ram cannot make laws for the temple
 bijepi kii to yahi line he ki ram mandir ke maamle main court kaa faisla hi antim hoga
 Suddenly, where did the matter of majority in the Rajya Sabha of Ram temple come from
 vaise agar sarkaar chaahe to bhoomi adhigrahan bill kii tarah ram mandir ke liye bhi rajyasabha or loksabhaa kii saajha baithak bulaakar ram mandir ke sambandhit kisi agyaat vidheyak ko paas kar sakati he
 Arun Jaitley has raised a serious issue
 par unase kuch sawaal puche jane chahie
 What does he mean by the occasional waiver of questioning the discretion of the Lok Sabha
 kya ve rajyasabha kii bhoomika ko simit karne kii baat kar rahe hai
 Then why don't they directly say that there should be no Rajya Sabha of which they are members
 samvidhan sabha main jo bahes hui uskaa mul hi tha ki second chember nahin hona chahie isse kanoon banane kii gati dhimi hogi
 If Jaitley says that session by session or bill by bill, do not question the discretion of the Rajya Sabha, what should he do
 uske sadsy kya karen
 Would he like to be a member of a House that has no active role? kya ve maanate hai ki vipaksh main rahete hue unhone rajyasabha main loksabhaa ke vivek par bevajaah sawaal khadey kiye
 Did he question merit or block the decisions of the Lok Sabha for political reasons
 yahi raay agar ek saal pehle upie ke kisi netaa ne kahi hoti to bijepi yaa jetali kii kya raay hoti
 Would he have been involved in this serious debate, or would have called the government then anti-constitution, anti-democracy
 yah sahi he ki ucch sadan bhi ab nimna sadan yani loksabhaa kii tarah raajnneetik kaarnon se kaam karne laga he
 The scale of discretion is also a political reason
 par is sthiti main laane main to sabaki baraabar bhoomika he
 Sixty-year-old argument will not work here
 rajyasabha gargian kii bhoomika nahin nibhaa rahi he
 If Jaitley wants to debate about the abolition of the Rajya Sabha or the Legislative Councils in the states, they want to reach a decision, then they can get a lot of support from the debate in the Constituent Assembly, but they should tell that the Rajya Sabha in which they themselves are many They have been opposing the laws, why is the patient responding in the same house when their law is opposed
 rajyasabha rajyon kii pratinidhi sanstha he
 The Council of Ministers is not responsible to the Rajya Sabha
 agar rajyasabha main sarkaar kaa bahumat nahin he tab sarkaar par sadan kaa niyantran zarur ho jaataa he
 It seems that Arun Jaitley is feeling the same
 phir bhi paryaapt praavdhaan hai ki agar donon sadanon main takaraav kii naubat aa gai to sanyukt adhiveshan bulaayaa ja saktaa he
 This has happened three times, but nowhere in the constitution is it written that this cannot happen ten times
 ab aate hai samvidhan sabha main second chember yani rajyasabha yaa vidhaan parishad ko lekar hui bahes par
 But one must be careful
 aksar netaa apane hisaab se samvidhan sabha kii bahes kii asahmati or sahmati kaa hawala de dete hai
 You cannot put the disagreement raised during the debate over the verdict because that verdict is done by vote or consensus

 6 January 1949 was also a Thursday and 13 May 2015 was also a Thursday when Arun Jaitley questioned the discretion of the Rajya Sabha
 internet kii duniya main aise sanyogon kii khub puch hoti he isliye likh diya varna iskaa bahes se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 The question before the Constituent Assembly was whether the states should have a Legislative Council
 pashchim bengal kii renuka re vidhaan parishad or dohare sadan kii avadharana ke hi khilaaf thim
 He said that if the Upper House has to test whether the law is made in haste, then the Governor and the President have enough power to urge the House to reconsider the bill
 duusare sadan se kanoon banane kii gati dhimi ho jaaegi jabaki bharat ko aarthik or saamaajik kshetra main tezi se kanoon banane kii zarurat he
 Therefore, we should still decide that the Constitution does not have a system of the second house
 isse koi laabh nahin he
 Another member OV Algesan protests that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has also submitted the report of the Provincial Constitution Committee, saying that there should be only one house
 meraa to maananaa he ki yah kuch or nahin balki netaaon ke liye vriddhavastha pension he
 It is a strange coincidence that the opinion was in 1949, the same opinion is heard even today
 rajya sabha to ritair log hi jate hai
 But how can we assume that Arun Jaitley is a retired politician who is there for pension! is bahes ke jawaab main doctor bi aar ambedkar kehete hai ki second chember ke paksh main meri koi thos raay nahin he
 In many cases it may be even better
 yah bahes france kii samvidhan sabha ke samay se chal rahi he
 Ambedkar cites a statement by Abe Saye that if the upper house agrees with the lower house (lok Sabha) then it is meaningless but if it is not agreed then it is useless

 The comments agar ham samvidhan sabha kii bahason kaa yahaan vahaan se zikr karne kii jaldbaazi ne karen to is par vichaar karnaa chahie ki rajya sabha kii bhoomika par sawaal kyon uthaaya gaya
 Many governments have worked without majority in the Lok Sabha
 bahumat na hone kaa ronaa bhi royaa he, lekin kisi ne nahin kaha ki bahumat bhale na ho magar jo sarkaar main he unke vivek par sadan ko kabhi-kabhaar hi sawaal karnaa chahie
 Should not be done session by session
 yah bhi kahaan likhaa he ki loksabhaa kaa vivek hi antim he yaa hona chahie
 There can also be a conflict with the judiciary over the law
 phir chunaav ke baad janata apane vivek ko loksabhaa ke bharose chhod degi
 It is not clear how Jaitley evaluates the Rajya Sabha
 kya unhen bahumat kaa ekadhikaar chahie yaa phir ve asahmatiyon ko jagah na dene kii vakaalat kar rahe hai

 Are they talking about limiting the role of Rajya Sabha
 phir ve sidhe kyon nahin kehete ki rajyasabha hi nahin hona chahie, jiske ve sadsy hai
 The reason for the debate in the Constituent Assembly was that there should not be a second chamber, this would slow down the pace of legislation
 agar jetali yah kehete hai ki satr dar satr yaa bill dar bill rajyasabha loksabhaa ke vivek par sawaal na karen to vah kya karen
 What should its members do? kya ve khud aise sadan kaa sadsy hona chahenge, jisaki koi sakriy bhoomika na ho
 Do they believe that while in opposition, they raised unnecessary questions on the discretion of the Lok Sabha in the Rajya Sabha
 kya ve merit par sawaal karte the yaa loksabhaa ke faislon ko raajnneetik kaarnon se roka karte the
 If a UPA leader had said the same opinion a year ago, what would have been the opinion of BJP or Jaitley
 kya ve is gambhir bahes main shaamil hote yaa tab kii sarkaar ko samvidhan virdohi, loktantr virdohi tehraate
 It is true that the upper house has also started functioning due to political reasons like the lower house i
e
 Lok Sabha
 vahaan bhi vivek kaa paimaana raajnneetik kaaran hi he
 But everyone has an equal role to play in this situation
 yahaan to saath saal vaala tark nahin chalegaa
 The Rajya Sabha is not playing the role of Guardian
 agar jetali rajyasabha yaa rajyon main vidhaan parishadon kii samaapti ko lekar bahes hi karnaa chaahate hai, kisi faisle par pahunchnaa chaahate hai to samvidhan sabha kii bahes se unhen kaaphi kuch sahaara mil saktaa he, lekin unhen bataanaa to chahie ki jis rajyasabha main ve khud kai kanoonon kaa virodh karte rahe hai usee sadan main unke kanoon kaa virodh hone par dhiraj kyon jawaab de rahaa he
 The Rajya Sabha is the representative body of the states
 mantriparishad rajyasabha ke prati zimmedaar nahin hota he
 If the government does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha, then the control of the house becomes certain over the government
 aisa prathit hota he ki arun jetali ko yahi mahasoos ho rahaa he
 Nevertheless, there are enough provisions that if there is a conflict in both the houses then a joint session can be called
 aisa teen baar ho chukaa he, lekin samvidhan main kahin nahin likhaa he ki yah das baar nahin ho saktaa he
 Now come to the debate in the Constituent Assembly on the Second Chamber ie Rajya Sabha or Legislative Council
 par ek saavdhaanee baratiyegaa
 Often, leaders cite disagreement and consensus in the Constituent Assembly debate
 bahes ke dauraan jataai gai asahmati ko aap faisle ke upar nahin rakh sakate kyonki wo faisla matdaan yaa sarvasammati se hua hota he
 Many politicians do this, but the responsible citizen should not
 6 janvari 1949 bhi guuruuvaar kaa din tha or 13 may 2015 bhi guuruuvaar jab arun jetali ne rajyasabha ke vivekadhikaar par sawaal uthaae
 In the world of Internet, there is a lot of inquiries about such coincidences, hence it is written otherwise it has nothing to do with the debate
 samvidhan sabha ke saamne sawaal tha ki kya rajyon main vidhaan parishad honi chahie
 Renuka Ray of West Bengal was against the Legislative Council and the concept of a double house
 unka kahana tha ki agar ucch sadan ko yahi pareekshan karnaa he ki kanoon jaldbaazi main to nahin bana he to iske liye rajyapal or raashtrapati ko paryaapt adhikaar he ki ve sadan se bill par dobaaraa vichaar karne ke liye aagrah kar sakate hai
 The pace of legislating from the second house will slow down, while India needs to make laws faster in the economic and social sphere
 isliye hamen abhi hi tay kar lenaa chahie ki samvidhan main duusare sadan kii vyavastha hi na ho
 There is no benefit from it
 ek or sadsy o ve alagesan virodh karte hue kehete hai ki sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne bhi prantiy samvidhan cameti kii report pesh karte hue kaha he ki ek hi sadan hona chahie
 i believe it is nothing but old age pension for leaders
 ajeeb sanyog he jo raay 1949 main thi vahi raay aaj bhi sunne ko mil jaati he
 Rajya Sabha is the retiree only
 lekin ham kaise maan len ki arun jetali ritair rajaneta he, jo pension ke liye vahaan hai ! In response to this debate, Dr
 BR Ambedkar says that i have no firm opinion in favor of the Second Chamber
 kai maamalon main yah behatar bhi ho saktaa he
 This debate has been going on since the time of the Constituent Assembly of France
 ambedkar kisi abe saiye ke ek kathan kaa hawala dete hai ki agar ucch sadan nimna sadan( loksabhaa) se sahamat ho jaae to yah vyarth hi he lekin agar sahamat na ho to bekaar hi he
 You readers must have understood this pinch
 lekin doctor ambedkar kehete hai ki french samvidhan sabha ne is raay ko kabhi sweekaar nahin kiya
 There is also a Second Chamber
 yah zarur he ki samvidhan main second chember kii vyavastha to he magar prayog ke taur he
 That is why we have not considered the Second Chamber permanent in the draft Constitution
 ise samaapt karne kaa praavdhaan bhi diya he
 As of now, it should be accepted in the Constitution as an agreement
 tippaniyan If we make haste to mention the debates of the Constituent Assembly from here, then we should consider why the role of Rajya Sabha was questioned
 loksabhaa main bhi kai sarkaron ne bina bahumat ke kaam kiya he
 The cries of not having a majority have also cried, but no one has said that the majority of the people who are in government should question the discretion of the House only occasionally
 satr dar satr nahin karnaa chahie
 Where is it written that the discretion of the Lok Sabha is final or should be
 kanoon ko lekar nyaaypalika se bhi to takaraav ho saktaa he
 After the election, the public will leave their discretion in the Lok Sabha
 yah saaf nahin he ki jetali rajyasabha kaa moolyankan kis tarah se karte hai
 Do they want a majority monopoly or are they advocating not giving space to disagreements
 ek taraf jahaan pradhanmantri sanghavaad kii vakaalat karte rahete hai duusari taraf unke vittamantri rajyon kii pratinidhi sanstha rajyasabha par sawaal kar rahe hai
 If Jaitley says that session by session or bill by bill, do not question the discretion of the Rajya Sabha, what should he do
 uske sadsy kya karen
 Would he like to be a member of a House that has no active role? kya ve maanate hai ki vipaksh main rahete hue unhone rajyasabha main loksabhaa ke vivek par bevajaah sawaal khadey kiye
 Did he question merit or block the decisions of the Lok Sabha for political reasons
 yahi raay agar ek saal pehle upie ke kisi netaa ne kahi hoti to bijepi yaa jetali kii kya raay hoti
 Would he have been involved in this serious debate, or would have called the government then anti-constitution, anti-democracy
 yah sahi he ki ucch sadan bhi ab nimna sadan yani loksabhaa kii tarah raajnneetik kaarnon se kaam karne laga he
 The scale of discretion is also a political reason
 par is sthiti main laane main to sabaki baraabar bhoomika he
 Sixty-year-old argument will not work here
 rajyasabha gargian kii bhoomika nahin nibhaa rahi he
 If Jaitley wants to debate about the abolition of the Rajya Sabha or the Legislative Councils in the states, they want to reach a decision, then they can get a lot of support from the debate in the Constituent Assembly, but they should tell that the Rajya Sabha in which they themselves are many They have been opposing the laws, why is the patient responding in the same house when their law is opposed
 rajyasabha rajyon kii pratinidhi sanstha he
 The Council of Ministers is not responsible to the Rajya Sabha
 agar rajyasabha main sarkaar kaa bahumat nahin he tab sarkaar par sadan kaa niyantran zarur ho jaataa he
 It seems that Arun Jaitley is feeling the same
 phir bhi paryaapt praavdhaan hai ki agar donon sadanon main takaraav kii naubat aa gai to sanyukt adhiveshan bulaayaa ja saktaa he
 This has happened three times, but nowhere in the constitution is it written that this cannot happen ten times
 ab aate hai samvidhan sabha main second chember yani rajyasabha yaa vidhaan parishad ko lekar hui bahes par
 But one must be careful
 aksar netaa apane hisaab se samvidhan sabha kii bahes kii asahmati or sahmati kaa hawala de dete hai
 You cannot put the disagreement raised during the debate over the verdict because that verdict is done by vote or consensus
 kai rajaneta aisa karte hai par zimmedaar naagarik ko aisa nahin karnaa chahie
 6 January 1949 was also a Thursday and 13 May 2015 was also a Thursday when Arun Jaitley questioned the discretion of the Rajya Sabha
 internet kii duniya main aise sanyogon kii khub puch hoti he isliye likh diya varna iskaa bahes se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 The question before the Constituent Assembly was whether the states should have a Legislative Council
 pashchim bengal kii renuka re vidhaan parishad or dohare sadan kii avadharana ke hi khilaaf thim
 He said that if the Upper House has to test whether the law is made in haste, then the Governor and the President have enough power to urge the House to reconsider the bill
 duusare sadan se kanoon banane kii gati dhimi ho jaaegi jabaki bharat ko aarthik or saamaajik kshetra main tezi se kanoon banane kii zarurat he
 Therefore, we should still decide that the Constitution does not have a system of the second house
 isse koi laabh nahin he
 Another member OV Algesan protests that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has also submitted the report of the Provincial Constitution Committee, saying that there should be only one house
 meraa to maananaa he ki yah kuch or nahin balki netaaon ke liye vriddhavastha pension he
 It is a strange coincidence that the opinion was in 1949, the same opinion is heard even today
 rajya sabha to ritair log hi jate hai
 But how can we assume that Arun Jaitley is a retired politician who is there for pension! is bahes ke jawaab main doctor bi aar ambedkar kehete hai ki second chember ke paksh main meri koi thos raay nahin he
 In many cases it may be even better
 yah bahes france kii samvidhan sabha ke samay se chal rahi he
 Ambedkar cites a statement by Abe Saye that if the upper house agrees with the lower house (lok Sabha) then it is meaningless but if it is not agreed then it is useless
 aap pathak is chutki ko samaj gaye honge
 But Dr
 Ambedkar says that the French Constituent Assembly never accepted this opinion
 vahaan bhi second chember he
 It is of course that the constitution has the provision of second chamber but as an experiment
 isiilie hamane samvidhan ke masaude main second chember ko sthaayee nahin mana he
 Provision has also been given to abolish it
 philhal samjhaute ke taur par ise samvidhan main sweekaar kar liya janaa chahie
 The comments agar ham samvidhan sabha kii bahason kaa yahaan vahaan se zikr karne kii jaldbaazi ne karen to is par vichaar karnaa chahie ki rajya sabha kii bhoomika par sawaal kyon uthaaya gaya
 Many governments have worked without majority in the Lok Sabha
 bahumat na hone kaa ronaa bhi royaa he, lekin kisi ne nahin kaha ki bahumat bhale na ho magar jo sarkaar main he unke vivek par sadan ko kabhi-kabhaar hi sawaal karnaa chahie
 Should not be done session by session
 yah bhi kahaan likhaa he ki loksabhaa kaa vivek hi antim he yaa hona chahie
 There can also be a conflict with the judiciary over the law
 phir chunaav ke baad janata apane vivek ko loksabhaa ke bharose chhod degi
 It is not clear how Jaitley evaluates the Rajya Sabha
 kya unhen bahumat kaa ekadhikaar chahie yaa phir ve asahmatiyon ko jagah na dene kii vakaalat kar rahe hai
 While the Prime Minister continues to advocate federalism, on the other hand, his Finance Minister is questioning the Rajya Sabha, the representative body of the states
 yah sahi he ki ucch sadan bhi ab nimna sadan yani loksabhaa kii tarah raajnneetik kaarnon se kaam karne laga he
