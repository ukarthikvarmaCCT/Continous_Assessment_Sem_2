 - mata parvati ke saath sabhi ganon or nandi se ghire bhagwaan shiv kii puja karne se maan-sammaan miltaa he

 Savita means Surya or Tej, but it is not so with reference to poetess Savita Singh
 apane naam ke saath singh lagane ke baad bhi vah keval 'stri' he
 In its entirety, and also in incompleteness
 sabalata or sahajata kaa ek anokhaa mishran he unamem
 Those who see his success in the fields of literature, education, administration, may be skeptical about his being a poet
 par vah aisi hi hai, udaar or kathorta ke ajab virodhabhasi aavaran ko samete
 And at the core of all this, the 'woman' inside him fell in love
 mamata se otprot
 Whoever ever met him, his voice and whoever read, was convinced of his writing poems
 bihar ke aara jile ke sampann parivaar main 5 farvari, 1962 unka janm hua
 The language of instruction was English and the home language was Bhojpuri, Hindi
 mata-pita desh ke baahar rahete the, so har chuttee main unase milane videsh janaa or padhai ke dinon main khub padhanaa unke liye shagal jaisaa tha
 Due to this, he also earned a lot of academic qualifications
 dilli vishvavidhyalay se eme, emphil karne ke baad ucch shiksha ke liye vah motrial ke macgil vishvavidhyalay chali gayi
 The topic of his research was 'the Discourse of Modernity in India: An Explanatory Study'

 During this time he wrote poems in English
 bharat lautin to adhyaapan se jud gayi
 Meanwhile, the creative journey also continued

 Currently, she is Professor and Director of School of Gender and Development Studies at Indira Gandhi National Open University

 She is a strong speaker in Hindi and English, apart from the social, political scene, and women's discourse
 samakaleen vaicharik muddon sahit antarrashtriya patr-patrikaon main unke shodh-patr tathaa saahitiyik rachanaaen chhapati rahi hai
 His first collection of poems 'apne Jaise Jeevan' was awarded by the Hindi Academy in 2001
 unhone stri ke marm ko itani shiddat se mahasusa ki unki kavitaaon main vah apane aap abhivyakt hote gaye
 Its hallmark is found in most of his poems
 par savita singh ke kavita kii stri keval dard kii hi nahin, saahas kii bhi pratimurti he
 Look at the opening lines of his 'darpan Ki Laughter' poem - a laughter mirror - he had put on his lips in which the gods saw their sorrows

 'sahitya ajtak' ne savita singh ke janmdin par unase lambii baatcheet kii
 Excerpts: Tell me something about your childhood? Savita Singh: My childhood was a magical childhood
 jisamen har roj nai chijen sikhti thi, nai chijen padhati thi, nae logon se milti thi, nae fal khaati thi
 The new bird watched, loved nature
 mere ghar ke peeche ek bada bagan tha, vahaan algalag tarah ke pedpaudhe the, to main aksar main vahaan hoti thi
 My childhood was thus a happy childhood
 haalanki mere mata-pita hameshaa videsh main rahete the
 We got good Indian education so they had left us here
 yahaan ham ek sanyukt, bharepure parivaar main chachaa, chachee, dada-daadi, bhai-bahan sabhi ke saath rahete the
 Our family was a prosperous family, so there was no physical absence, no sorrow
 par mata-pita ke saath na rahane kaa asar manovaigyanik rup se rahata tha
 Although parents used to keep coming, yet a kind of gap that has been created remains as a stain even today
 shaayad isiilie maine apana puraa samay padhane-likhane main laga diya
 Because i believe that there is no alternative to reading and writing
 vah aapke swa kaa hissaa he
 Moving into a world of knowledge where every one of your questions gets answered
 isiilie maine apane ko gyaan arjeet karne main laga diya
 It made me independent and autonomous
 isiilie main ne apni ek alag duniya si bana lee
 i started to understand the inside world better
 isse maine logon se cat kar apana ek alag ekant bana liya
 Between the world of books
 mere ghar main ek badi librari thi, mere dada ji kii, ve sab bahut padhane likhane vaale log the
 So we lived in the city, in the village, and then went abroad to our parents, especially Kuwait, where my father mostly lived
 iran, iraq, moscow in jagahon par gaye
 Our life was not stable in one place
 jaisi baahar kii yatra thi, waisi hi andar kii yatra thi
 That is why i felt since childhood that the purpose of this life is something else
 yah saamaanya jivan nahin he
 All children live in one place with their parents, we live ten places
 par koi aisi kami nahin thi, par vah jo khala thim vah apane andar kii thi
 He is still today
 isiilie yah likhnaa ab tak jari he
 When did your formal writing begin? When did you think you could write? This is my path? Savita Singh: i started writing from the age of seven to eight years old
 bachapan se hi diary likhnaa shuru kar diya tha
 The bird used to write about what she saw, about birds, ants, whatever was beautiful in nature
 shuruaati kism kaa lekhan jo diary main tha vahaan bhi kavita kaa rup le leti thim
 But when i formally passed school and summer vacation came, i wrote a lot of poems and i thought i could write poems
 par chhapane kaa kautuhal nahin tha us samay
 i just wanted to write well
 apane man kii baat jaisaa main chaahati thi
 i used to read Tolstoy, read Dostoevsky, my house was filled with his books
 kavitaayen main bahut sahaj dhang se likhti thi
 Do you write in both Hindi and English languages? Writing in which language makes you more relaxed? Savita Singh: Hard to say
 kyonki ek str par aakar bhashaaen ek vyakti ke liye ek hi sansar kii rachana karti hai, kyonki bhashaa hi sansar he
 i believe both love and solitude are possible in this
 meri ek kavita he 'ruth kaa sapana', usamen he yahi baat
 It is reassuring in both languages
 agar main kisi teesri bhashaa main likhuun to usamen bhi sukun he
 By going in poetry, you get everything in language
 aapke sochane kii bhashaa kya he?savita singhsameri sochane kii bhashaa do kya teen hai
 Hindi, English and Bhojpuri
 yah bada vicitra he ki jab main un logon se baat karti hum jo bhojpuri main baat karte hai to unheen kii bhashaa main sochati hum
 The same is with Hindi and English
 sari bhashaaen saath-saath chalati rahati hai
 Everyone is equally loved, attached and relaxed
 aapaki pasandida rachana, pasandida kriti?savita singhbais sawaal kaa jawaab bhi bahut mushkil he
 Because you read the things that you like, you become human only by reading them
 to kitni sari kitaaben hongi jinhone aapaki madad kii hogi
 But one of the books that i will definitely discuss is Jane Eyre, this is a wonderful novel
 meraa maananaa he ki sabhi logon ne ise avashya padhaa hoga
 i love Mahadevi very much in Hindi
 silvia plath, emily dickinson, dostovsky mere pasandida lekhak he
 The creations that make you, are the ones that are your favorite
 stri aapaki kavita kaa mukhya paatr kyon he? uskaa dukh, akelaapan, sangharsh kyon he?savita singhsameri rachanaaen femenist kavitaayen hai
 The world of my consciousness is very much considered for the suffering of women
 mujhe aisa lagata he ki pidaa ne hi stri ko gadha he
 The atrocities that are committed on him only
 main puri duniya main jahaan bhi gai, maantrial jahaan se maine piechdi kii, england main rahi, har jagah maine dekha ki stri-purush baraabar nahin hai
 They are not equal because there is a difference in their physical structure, rather this society wants to keep women under control
 yah ek bada dukh he, dosha he is sansar kaa
 In my academic life, i am a political theorist, but i find myself close to feminism inside
 loktantr, samanta, marks aadi ke siddhanton ke bich ek bada tabaka jo stri he, uske bare main koi baat nahin hoti
 i consider the liberation of women as the biggest question in the era of consciousness
 meraa maananaa he ki manushyata ko ise suljhaana hi hoga

 During this time there was a discussion whether a satellide would be sufficient to monitor the movements on the borders or that each force needed to provide a dedicated satellite

 Satellite can play an important role in border management

 is dharna ke vipareet nirmala sitaraman ko commers ministry se pramot kar sidhe dephence kii jimmedaari de di gai
 During the last three years, what were the achievements of Nirmala Sitharaman as commerce minister that she was given this responsibility on the basis of performance? Or is the political reason for this responsibility given that Nirmala has emerged as a 'power lady'
 bijepi ke liye dakshin bharat se abtak venkaiya naidu sabase bada cheharaa tha
 After he was made Vice President, the biggest challenge for the party was to give a new face to the South
 nirmala tamilnadu se hai
 He has good relations with all political parties in the southern states and his entire political journey has been away from controversies
 aise main venkaiya kii jagah lene ke liye bijepi ke paas nirmala se behatar koi or netaa nahin tha
 Along with being from Tamil Nadu, Nirmala has been educated in Delhi
 isi vajah se angreji ke saath-saath hindi par bhi unki pakad rahi he
 She can also communicate in languages of the South region other than Tamil
 vah purv main party kii pravaktaa pad kii jimmedaari bhi bakhubi nibhaa chuki hai
 Hence, BJP as Nirmala has got a chance to meet the lack of a big face at the national level
 ise bhi padhein: iconomi ke front par kahin jorge bush jaise maat na kha jaaen narendra modidakshin ke rajyon main bijepi ke saamne sabase badi chunauti 2018 main karnataka or andhrapradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav he
 At the same time, before the cabinet expansion and after Venkaiah Naidu became the Vice President, there was no big minister from the south in the Modi government
 nirmala ko pramot kar modi sarkaar ne in rajyon ko saaf sanket die hai ki centre kii sarkaar main dakshin rajyon kii apni ahmiyat he
 Apart from these, an important aspect in making Nirmala a power lady was that the defense ministry was not to be commanded in the hands of any high-profile person in the Modi government
 jiske chalate baar-baar yah mantralay bataur anya kaman ke taur par vitt mantri ke adheen rahaa
 Now after giving the responsibility of defense to Nirmala, it is clear that all the big and big decisions of the ministry will be taken under the supervision of the Prime Minister
 gauratlab he ki in raajnneetik kaarnon se nirmala ko dephence mantralay kaa kaarybhaar diya gaya he, yah isse bhi spasht hota he ki beete 3 saal ke dauraan bataur commers ministar unki koi khaas uplabdhi nahin rahi
 The figures of export during the last three years or the performance of the industrial sector or the steady decline in GDP further confirm that Nirmala's contribution has not been significant
 aarthik front par is sthiti ke liye sirf vitt mantri arun jetali ko akele jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa, kyonki in kshetron main unke saath nirmala kaa bhi daayitv rahaa he

 Shailendra Pandey - Astrology loksabhaa main guuruuvaar ko teen talaak vidheyak ko paarit karaane ke liye joardaar bahes hui
 Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said in the Lok Sabha that it should not be viewed from a political prism, as it aims to empower Muslim women
 udhar vipakshi is baat par ade rahe ki ise sanyukt pravar samiti ke paas bheja janaa chahie
 Keeping the table for the passage of the Muslim Women (protection on Marriage Rights) 2018 Bill and dismissing the objections raised in relation to it, Prasad said that urgent three divorce cases must be stopped and for a law is needed
 vidheyak ko paarit karaane ke paksh main kendriya kanoon mantriravishankar prasadne kaha ki vidheyak kisi samudaay, dharm, aasthaa ke khilaaf nahin he, balki yah mahilaon ke liye insaaf tay karegaa
 He said, between January 2018 and December 10, we faced around 477 cases of triple talaq
 yahaan tak ki buudhvaar ko bhi is tarah kaa ek maamlahyderabadase hamaare saamne aayaa
 It was for these reasons that we brought ordinances
 yah bataate hue ki 20 islamic rashtron ne teen talaak par pratibandh laga diya he, mantri ne poocha ki bharat jesedharmanirpekaidesh main aisa kyon nahin hua? unhone sadan ko sarvasammati se vidheyak paarit karne kaa aagrah karte hue kaha, main aagrah karata hum ki ise raajnneetik pariprekshya se nahin dekha jaae
 This House has given the provision of hanging for the wrongdoers
 isi sadan nedehejur mahilaon ke hiton kii raksha ke liye gharelu hinsa ke khilaaf vidheyak paarit kiya he
 Therefore, why can't we support this bill in unison
 prasad ne kaha ki sarkaar iske liye 'khule dimag' se kaam kar rahi he or isamen kisi bhi prakaar kaa pakshpaat nahin kiya gaya he
 In addition, a number of concerns raised earlier under the new Bill have been included
 unhone kaha ki vidheyak kaa raajnneetik kaarnon se virodh nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Prasad said, "it should not be seen from the perspective of politics, but from the perspective of humanity
 agar koi thos suzav he to sarkaar is par vichaar karegi
 "this bill was passed in Lok Sabha in December last year but it could not be passed in the Lok Sabha
 kuch badlaavon ke saath nae vidheyak ko is maheene sadan main hangaame ke bich pesh kiya gaya tha
 Earlier, opposition members opposed the bill being brought and demanded that it be referred to the Joint Select Committee
 nayaa vidheyak sitambar main laae gaye adhyadesh ke sthaan par laayaa gaya he, jiske antargat muslim mahilaon ko unke pati kii ore se teen 'talaak' bolkar talaak dene par pabandi lagaai gai he
 Under this, immediate three divorces have been made punishable, under which there is a provision for a sentence of three years with fine
 yah aparaadh tab sangyeya hoga jab vivaahit muslim mahila yaa phir uskaa kareebi rishtedaar us vyakti ke khilaaf soochna degaa, jisane tatkaal teen talaak diya he

 Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said, this is an important bill and it needs to be considered
 yah ek sanvaidhanik maamla he
 It is also related to a particular religion
 main aagrah karata hum ki is vidheyak ko pravar samiti ke paas bheja jaae
 Prasad rejected the opposition's opposition and said the Congress supported the triple talaq bill last year
 ravishankar prasadne kaha, jab sadan main isse pehle vidheyak ko laayaa gaya tha, congress ke sadasyon ne iskaa samarthan kiya tha or iske paksh main vot diya tha
 At that time he did not demand that it be sent to the Select Committee
 premchand ne majbootee ke saath vidheyak kaa virodh kiya or kaha ki yah samvidhan ke mul siddhanton ke khilaaf he
 He said, "the bill is brought in haste
 yah raajnneeti se prerit he or2019 loksabhaa chunaavonko dekhte hue ise laayaa gaya he

 On several later occasions, when there was a need to fight with clenched teeth, he smiled and left somewhere else
 priyanka ke aagaman kaa yaheen se arth khulata he
 Now Rahul and Priyanka's pair can renew the ambition in Congress which the Congress worker has been feeling lacking
 ve congress ke kuch tehre hue talab main ek kankad kii tarah hai jisase paidaa tarangen dur tak jaaengi
 Such a stir can create a huge difference in elections for Congress workers
 duusari baat yah ki yah samajhnaa zaruri he ki rahul or priyanka kii congress puraani congress se kaaphi bhinn he
 There is a kind of hesitancy in this Congress towards the Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi, this Congress is different from Rajiv Gandhi's response to the 1984 violence
 yah do shareef or sadashayi yuvaaon kii congress he jo daliton-adivaasiyon-kisaanon ke prati zyaada saday he
 Whether Rahul's attitude towards Mirchpur violence or Niamhgiri's stand with tribals - this Congress has shown its differences
 beshak, yah koi krantikari badlaav nahin he
 The Congress has still lost many of the fortunes that the BJP has learned faster than that
 lekin sansadeey raajnneeti kii simaaon ke bheetar ek bade chunaav se pehle congress jo bada daanv khel sakati thi, yah vah daanv zarur he
 Because this also changes the battle front and field
 bijepi ko ab rahul ke alaava priyanka kaa bhi muqaabala karnaa he
 Other parties now have to take care of Priyanka in their synergy or bargain
 congress kaaryakartaaon ke liye yah vah badlaav he jo unamem ek nai sphurti paidaa kar saktaa he
 Despite all this, the question remains whether the 2019 election map will change with Priyanka's presence? The 2019 election will answer this question, but it tells the question that we have become accustomed to think in very small contexts
 2019 ke nattejey jo bhi hon, uske baad bhi priyanka kii sakriyata congress ke liye zaruri hogi,- or sambhawatah bhartiya raajnneeti ko zyaada sambhavnapurna banaaegi

 On the other hand, PM Narendra Modi, along with campaigning continuously, is inaugurating schemes worth thousands of crores of rupees

 The opposition has raised questions on the Election Commission whether they are delaying announcing the election under pressure from PM Modi? CEC Sunil Arora has returned to Delhi on the night of March 5 to take stock of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir

 Ahmed Patel asked- Waiting for whom Ahmed Patel, who is included in the Congress think tank, has questioned by tweeting whether the Election Commission is waiting for the completion of the official programs of PM Narendra Modi to announce the dates of Lok Sabha elections
 patel ne aarope lagaaya ki sarkari kaaryakramon kaa istemaal raajnneetik sabhaaon, tivi, radio or print par raajnneetik vigyapanon ke liye ho rahaa he
 It seems as if the Election Commission is giving the government complete leeway to use government money till the last minute

 Whether elections in five states were held in 2018 or Gujarat assembly elections in 2017, the Congress has been targeting PM Narendra Modi for delay in issuing the notification

 Congress spokesperson Rundeep Singh Surjewala said that the Election Commission first timed 12 of the press conference on 6 October
 30 baje diya, lekin piem modi ke dabaav main thodi der baad samay badhaakar dopaher teen baje kar diya gaya
 3 Facts- Draw your own conclusions
 1
 ECI announces a PC at 12
 30 today to announce elction dates to the 5 states
 2
 PM Modi is addressing a rally in Ajmer, Rajasthan at 1 PM today
 3
 ECI suddenly changes the time of announcement and PC to 3 PM
 Independence of ECI? - Randeep Singh Surjewala (@rssurjewala) October 6, 2018 The Commission had to be given by safaisurjewala, alleging that PM Modi was to have a rally in Ajmer, Rajasthan at one o'clock in the afternoon

 The Election Commission also had to be clarified on the charge of Congress
 ayog ne kaha tha ki piem kii raily kii vajah se chunaav kii ghoshnaa karne main deree nahin hui, balki kuch jaruri taiyaariyon ke chalate isamen vilamb hua
 What is the issue of notification? The date of election of the election should be announced by 21 days before the vote
 chunki adhisuchana jari hote hi aachaar samhita ke lagu hone ke chalate tamaam sarkari kaary behad simit ho jate hai, jisase kai chijen prabhavit hoti hai
 It is therefore attempted that the duration of the code of conduct be extremely limited

 This is revealed by a letter written by an accused from Beur Jail, in which it is said that SB Sinha, Kingping of the fodder scam, was pressurizing the accused in the case KM Prasad to say in his statement that Sushil Kumar gave Rs 5 lakh to Modi Were
 29 july 1996 ko patna ke beur jail se sibiai ke patna espi ko likhe patr main likhaa gaya ki jail ke andar jabardast sajeesh chal rahi he, unako fansaane ke liye jo is maamle main yachikakarta hai
 How can one forget the name of BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi in the main petitioner of the fodder scam
 chaara ghotaale ko ujagar karne main unki mahatvapurn bhoomika rahi he, isliye wo ghotalebaajon ke nishane par the
 The letter to the CBI stated that SB Sinha, the Kingping of the fodder scam, had conspired to implicate Sushil Kumar Modi so that his speech could be stopped
 ye patr likhane vaala koi or nahin balki is ghotaale kaa sutaradhar umesh prasad singh he
 He wrote a letter to the CBI SP and apprised her of the conspiracy
 28 july ko wo beur ke aspataal main jab biimaar pade keem prasad ko dekhne pahunche tab unhone ye baat unhen bataai or kaha ki maine modi ko keval akhabaaron or tivi dekha he, kabhi main unase mila nahin or na kabhi rupaya diya, to phir kaise unhen fansaa duun

 Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, who once walked shoulder to shoulder with Nitish Kumar, is now accusing the CBI of deliberately releasing Nitish Kumar and Shivanand Tiwari
 maje kii baat ye he ki sibiai ne 1996 main inhen aaropee nahin banaaya lekin paristhiti ab ki bataai ja rahi he, wo bhi ye ki congress jediu se gathbandhan ke liye sibiai kaa istemaal kar rahi he
 Well, it is a matter of thinking, now we come to the issue
 nitish kumaar or shivanand tiwari par aarope lagane kaa mukhya aadhaar chaara ghotaale ke kingping rahe esabi sinha kaa 161 ke tahat ranchi main die gaye bayaan ko banaaya gaya he, jisamen usne kaha tha ki nitish kumaar ke samta party ko chunaav main kharch ke liye 1 karod rupee 1994 main die the
 Simultaneously, Shivanand Tiwari was given 30 to 40 lakh rupees for the daughter's wedding in the same year and this money was given by Umesh Prasad Singh with his own hands
 umesh prasad singh ne kaha ki maine koi paisa nahin diya he or ye bayaan esabi sinha ne keval ranchi main sibiai ke espi ensi dhodhial or dspi shravan kumaar ke saamne hi kyon die, jabaki esabi sinha ne uske baad kareeb 7 jagahon par bayaan diya, lekin iskaa zikr nahin kiya
 If we talk about Umesh Prasad Singh, he is the main mastermind of the fodder scam
 inhe is ghotaale kii ek-ek baat maaloom he
 He was the section officer in the surveillance department but he is a major link in the scam
 inhone ise ujagar karne main bhi mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai halaki is vajah se inhen jail bhi janaa padaa, lekin sibiai ne baad main inhe bari kar diya

 1993 main bijepi ko satta se baahar karne ke liye samaajawaadee party pramukh mulaayam singh yadav or bispi pramukh kanshiram ne gathjod kiya tha
 At that time Uttarakhand was part of Uttar Pradesh and the total seats were 422
 mulaayam 256 seat par lade or bispi ko 164 seat di thim
 The SP and BSP alliance won the election
 espi ko 109 or bispi ko 67 seat mili thim iske baad mulaayam singh yadav bispi ke samarthan se mukhyamantri bane
 However, on 2 June 1995, the BSP withdrew support to the government due to mutual estrangement and announced withdrawal of support
 is vajah se mulaayam singh kii sarkaar alpamat main aa gai
 Additions and deletions were made to protect the government
 aise main ant main jab baat nahin bani to naaraaz sapa ke kaaryakarta or vidhayak lakhanu ke mirabai maarg sthit state guest house pahunch gaye, jahaan mayawati cameraa number-1 main thahari hui thim
 What happened in Uttar Pradesh's politics on the day of June 2, 1995 would hardly have happened anywhere
 mayawati par guest house ke cameraa number ek main hamalaa hua tha
 On June 2, 1995, Mayawati was meeting with her legislators in room number one of the state guest house in Lucknow
 tabhi dopaher kareeb teen baje kathith samaajawaadee party ke kaaryakartaaon kii bheed ne achaanak guest house par hamalaa bol diya
 Mayawati, the second leader in the BSP after Kanshi Ram, cannot forget that time in her lifetime
 us din ek samaajawaadee party ke vidhayakon or samarthakon kii unmaadi bheed sabak sikhaane ke naam par dalit netaa kii aabru par hamalaa karne par amada thi
 Ajay Bose's book 'behenji', based on the life of Mayawati, gives detailed information about the incident that occurred in the guesthouse that day
 bataaya jaataa he ki, 1995 ke guestaouse cond main jab kuch kathith taur par sapa ke gundon ne basapa supremeo mayawati ko kamare main band karke maaraa or unke kapade faad die the
 Somehow Mayawati had locked herself in the room and Samajwadi Party mlas and supporters from outside were engaged in breaking the door
 is bich, kaha jaataa he ki apni jaan par khelkar bijepi vidhayak bramhadatt dvivedi maukey par pahunche or sapa vidhayakon or samarthakon ko peeche dhakela
 Please tell that the image of Brahmadutt Dwivedi was also of a domineering leader
 upi kii raajnneeti main is cond ko guestaouse cond kaha jaataa he or ye bharat kii raajnneeti ke maathe par kalank he
 Mayawati herself started calling Brahmadatta Dwivedi a brother and kept saying publicly that he had saved my life regardless of his life
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki bramhadatt dvivedi sangh ke sevak the or unhen lathi chalaani bhi bakhubi aati thi isliye wo ek lathi lekar hathiyaaron se las gundon se bhid gaye the
 This is the reason that Mayawati too always considered him her elder brother and never pitched her candidate against him
 puure rajya main mayawati bijepi kaa virodh karti raheen, lekin farrukhabad main bramhadatt dvivedi ke liye prachaar karti thim
 It is said that when the goons later shot and killed Brahmadutt Dwivedi, Mayawati went to her house and wept bitterly
 unki vidhwaa ne jab chunaav ladaa tab mayawati ne unke khilaaf koi ummidavaar nahin utaara balki logon se apil kii thi ki meri jaan bachaane ke liye dushmani mol lekar shahid hone vaale mere bhai kii vidhwaa ko vot den
 According to some reports, he (samajwadi Party mlas, activists and mob) was using vulgar language and abusive language
 kaaman haul main baithe vidhayakon (bahujan samaaj party ke vidhayak) ne jaldi se mukhya dwaar band kar diya, parantu jhund ne use todakar khol diya
 Then they cracked down on the helpless BSP mlas and started slapping and thrashing them
 bataaya jaataa he ki kam-se-kam paanch basapa vidhayakon ko ghasitate hue jabardasti atithi grih ke baahar le jaakar gadiyon main daalaa gaya tha, jo unhen mukhyamantri ke nivas sthaan par le gaye
 These mlas were asked to sign and sign an oath to join the BSP rebel group led by Raj Bahadur and to support the Mulayam Singh government on a paper
 unamem se kuch to itane dar gaye the ki unhone kore kaagaj par hi dastakhat kar die
 The mlas were kept captive there for much of the night, at which time the BSP mlas were being held in the extreme house in such a way as to take the chickens to the butchers, in front of the set 1-2 of the rooms, Where Mayawati was sitting with some mlas
 ek vicitra naatak ghatit ho rahaa tha, baahar kii bheed se kuch-kuch vidhayak batch kar nikal aae the or unhone unheen kamaron me chhipane ke liye sharan le lee thi
 The last senior BSP leader to come in was RK Chaudhary, who was rescued under the supervision of constable Rashid Ahmed and Chaudhary's personal guard Lalchand
 kamaron main chhipe vidhayakon ko lalchand ne darvaaj andar se lock karne kii hidaayat di or unhone abhi daravaaje band hi kiye the ki bheed main se ek jhund galiyare main dhaddhadata hua ghusaa or darwaja peetane laga
 Mayawati was rescued by two junior police officers Himmat
 ye the vijay bhushan, jo hajratganj stesan ke house afasar (esechao) the or subhash singh baghel jo esechao (viipi) the, jinhone kuch sipaahiyon ko saath le kar badi mushkil se bheed ko peeche dhakela
 Then they all stood in queue in the corridor so that no one could cross them
 krodhit bheed ne phir bhi naare lagaana or gaaliyaan dena chaalu rakhaa or mayawati ko ghaseet kar baahar laane kii dhamkee detii rahi
 Apart from this courageous and timely action of some police officers, most of the officers present, including the handlers and security staff at the state guest house, made no attempt to stop the madness
 yah sab ek ghante se zyada samay tak chalata rahaa
 The statements of several BSP mlas and some police officers were shocking that while senior mlas of Lucknow OP Singh were also present at the time when the mlas were being kidnapped and Mayawati's rooms were under attack
 chashmadidon ke anusaar ve sirf khadey hue cigarette phoonk rahe the
 Immediately after the invasion began, the guest house's electricity and water supplies were cut off - another sign of the administration's collusion
 lakhanu ke jila magistrate ke vahaan pahunchane ke baad hi vahaan ki paristhiti main sudhaar aayaa
 He showed the courage and awareness of combating the angry mob
 espi rajeev ranjan ke saath milakar jila magistrat ne sabase pehle bheed ke un sadasyon ko atithigrih ke daayre ke baahar dhakela, jo vidhayak nahin the
 Later on the arrival of additional force organizations of the police, he got all the SP mlas, including the mlas, out of the purview of the state super-house
 yadhyapi aisa karne ke liye unhe vidhayakon par lathicharge karne ke hukum kaa sahaara lenaa padaa
 Still, he ignored the warning received from the Chief Minister's office not to take action against the SP members of the Assembly, and he stood by his decision
 apni duty bina dare or pakshpaat na karne ke falswaroop raat ko 11 baje ke baad jila magistrate ke liye tatkaal prabhavi rup se tabadale kaa hukum jari kar diya gaya
 The comments jaise hi rajyapal ke karyaalay, centre sarkaar or varisht bhaajapa netaaon ke dakhal dete hi zyada se zyada raksha dal vahaan pahunchane lage, atithi grih ke andar kii sthiti niyantrit hoti gai
 When the defenders took in and out of the building, the crowd started shouting, shouting slogans, threats and slogans
 mayawati or unke party vidhayakon ke samooh ko jinhone apane aap ko kamare ke set 1-2 ke andar band kiya hua tha, yakeen dilaane ke liye jila magistrate or anya adhikariyon ko baar anurodh karnaa padaa ki ab khatra tal gaya tha, or ve darwaja khol sakate the
 By the time they opened the door, it had been quite a night
 isi ke baad se mivati or mulaayam singh ke rishte kharaab ho gaye
 Since then, there has been no alliance between the two parties neither pre-election nor post-election for 24 years
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki guest house cond se espi-bispi main hui dushmani kya apana rukh badalati he ? Additions and deletions were made to protect the government

 isi ke baad se mivati or mulaayam singh ke rishte kharaab ho gaye
 Since then, there has been no alliance between the two parties neither pre-election nor post-election for 24 years
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki guest house cond se espi-bispi main hui dushmani kya apana rukh badalati he ? It is said that in the 1995 guesthouse scandal, when some SP SP goons allegedly stabbed BSP supremo Mayawati in a room and tore her clothes
 kisi tarah mayawati ne apane ko kamare main band kiya tha or baahar se samaajawaadee party ke vidhayak or samarthak darwaja todane main lage hue the
 Meanwhile, BJP MLA Bramhadutt Dwivedi is said to have played his life and rushed the SP mlas and supporters
 bataa den ki brahmadatt dvivedi kii chhavi bhi dabang netaa kii thi
 In UP politics, this scandal is called guesthouse scandal and it is a stigma on the forehead of India's politics
 khud mayawati bramhadatt dvivedi ko bhai kehane lageen or saarvajanik taur par kahati raheen ki apni jaan kii parvaah kiye bina unhone meri jaan bachaai thi
 For information, let us know that Brahmadatta was a servant of Dwivedi Sangh and he also knew how to handle lathi, so he had a fight with armed goons with a stick
 yahi vajah he ki mayawati ne bhi unhen hameshaa apana bada bhai mana or kabhi unke khilaaf apana ummidavaar khadaa nahin kiya
 Mayawati continued to oppose the BJP across the state, but campaigned for Brahmadatta Dwivedi in Farrukhabad
 kaha jaataa he ki jab gundon ne baad main brahmadatt dvivedi kii goli markar hatya kar di tab mayawati unke ghar gayi or foot-foot kar royee
 When her widow contested the election, Mayawati did not field any candidate against her, but appealed to the people to vote for my brother's widow who was martyred by taking hostility to save my life
 kuch reporton ke anusaar cheekh-pukaar machaate hue ve (samaajawaadee party ke vidhayak, kaaryakarta or bheed) ashleel bhashaa or gaali-galouj kaa istemaal kar rahe the
 The mlas sitting in the Common Hall (bahujan Samaj Party mlas) quickly closed the main gate, but the herd broke it open
 phir ve asahaay basapa vidhayakon par tut pade or unhen thappad maarane or latiyaane lage
 It is said that at least five BSP mlas were dragged and forced into vehicles on the outside of the guest house which took them to the Chief Minister's residence
 in vidhayakon ko raajbahadur ke netritv main basapa vidrohi gut main shaamil hone ke liye or ek kaagaj par mulaayam singh sarkaar ko samarthan dene kii shapath lete hue dastakhat karne ko kaha gaya tha
 Some of them were so scared that they signed it on blank paper
 vidhayakon ko raat main kaaphi der tak vahaan bandi banaae rakhaa gaya, jis samay atithigrih main basapa vidhayakon ko is tarah se dhar kar dabocha ja rahaa tha, jaise murgiyon ko kasaai khaane le jaaya ja rahaa ho, kamaron ke set 1-2 ke saamne, jahaan mayawati kuch vidhayakon ke saath baithi thim
 a strange drama was happening, some mlas escaped from the crowd outside and took refuge to hide in the same rooms
 andar aane vaale aakhri varisht basapa netaa aarake choudhary the, jinhen sipaahi rashid ahamed or choudhary ke nijee rakshak lalchand kii dekharekh main bachaa kar laae the
 The mlas hiding in the rooms were instructed by Lalchand to lock the doors from inside and they had just closed the doors so that a mob from the crowd roamed the corridor and started banging the door
 mayawati ko do kanishtha police afasaron himmat ne bachaaya
 These were Vijay Bhushan, the House Officer (SHO) at Hazratganj station, and Subhash Singh Baghel, who was the SHO (VIP), who took some of the soldiers along and pushed back the crowd with great difficulty
 phir ve sab galiyare main kataribaddh hokar khadey ho gaye taaki koi bhi unhen paar na kar sake
 The angry mob still kept shouting slogans and abusing and threatened to drag Mayawati out
 kuch police afasaron kii is sahaspurn or samayik kaarywahi ke alaava, zyaadaatar upasthit adhikariyon ne jinamein rajya atithi grih main sanchaalak or suraksha karmchaaree bhi shaamil the, is puure paagalpan ko rokane kii koi koshish nahin kii
 This all went on for over an hour
 kai basapa vidhayakon or kuch police adhikariyon ke ye bayaan stambhit karne vaale the ki jab vidhayakon ko apharan kiya ja rahaa tha or mayawati ke kamaron ke akraman ho rahaa tha, us samay vahaan lakhanu ke senior suprintedent of police opi singh bhi maujuud the
 According to eyewitnesses, they were just standing and blowing cigarettes
 akraman shuru hone ke turant baad rahasyatmak dhang se, atithi grih kii bijli or pani kii supplai kaat di gai-prashasan kii mileebhagat kaa ek or sanket
 The situation there improved only after the District Magistrate of Lucknow arrived there
 unhone krodhit bheed kaa dat kar muqabla karne kii himmat or jaagrukta kaa parichay diya
 The District Magistrate, together with SP Rajiv Ranjan, first pushed the members of the mob outside the confines of the guest house, who were not mlas
 baad main police ke atirikt bal sanghathanon ke aane par unhone sapa ke vidhayakon samet sabhi ko rajya atithi-grih ke daayre ke baahar nikalava diya
 However, to do so, he had to resort to the lathi charge of the mlas
 phir bhi sapa ke vidhansabha sadasyon ke khilaaf kaarywahi na karne kii mukhyamantri ke karyaalay se mili chetavanee ko ansuni karke ve apane faisle par date rahe
 The transfer order was issued to the District Magistrate with immediate effect after 11 o'clock at night, as a result of not doing his duty without fear and favor
 tippaniyan As more and more defense teams started reaching the Governor's office, the central government and senior BJP leaders interfered, the situation inside the guest house was controlled
 jab rakshakon ne building ke andar or baahar kabja kar liya tab gaaliyaan, dhamkiyaan or naare lagaati hui bheed dhire-dhire kam hoti chali gai
 Mayawati and her group of party mlas who had locked themselves inside the room set 1-2, had to make repeated requests to the District Magistrate and other officials to make sure that the threat was averted, and they opened the door
 Could jab unhone darwaja kholaa, tab tak kaaphi raat ho chuki thi
 Since then, Mayawati and Mulayam Singh's relationship deteriorated
 uske baad se 24 saal tak donon dalon ke bich naa to chunaav purv or naa hi chunaav ke baad koi gathbandhan hua he
 It remains to be seen whether the hostility caused by the guest house scandal in the SP-BSP changes
 upi kii raajnneeti main is cond ko guestaouse cond kaha jaataa he or ye bharat kii raajnneeti ke maathe par kalank he
 Mayawati herself started calling Brahmadatta Dwivedi a brother and kept saying publicly that he had saved my life regardless of his life
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki bramhadatt dvivedi sangh ke sevak the or unhen lathi chalaani bhi bakhubi aati thi isliye wo ek lathi lekar hathiyaaron se las gundon se bhid gaye the
 This is the reason that Mayawati too always considered him her elder brother and never pitched her candidate against him
 puure rajya main mayawati bijepi kaa virodh karti raheen, lekin farrukhabad main bramhadatt dvivedi ke liye prachaar karti thim
 It is said that when the goons later shot and killed Brahmadutt Dwivedi, Mayawati went to her house and wept bitterly
 unki vidhwaa ne jab chunaav ladaa tab mayawati ne unke khilaaf koi ummidavaar nahin utaara balki logon se apil kii thi ki meri jaan bachaane ke liye dushmani mol lekar shahid hone vaale mere bhai kii vidhwaa ko vot den
 According to some reports, he (samajwadi Party mlas, activists and mob) was using vulgar language and abusive language
 kaaman haul main baithe vidhayakon (bahujan samaaj party ke vidhayak) ne jaldi se mukhya dwaar band kar diya, parantu jhund ne use todakar khol diya
 Then they cracked down on the helpless BSP mlas and started slapping and thrashing them
 bataaya jaataa he ki kam-se-kam paanch basapa vidhayakon ko ghasitate hue jabardasti atithi grih ke baahar le jaakar gadiyon main daalaa gaya tha, jo unhen mukhyamantri ke nivas sthaan par le gaye
 These mlas were asked to sign and sign an oath to join the BSP rebel group led by Raj Bahadur and to support the Mulayam Singh government on a paper
 unamem se kuch to itane dar gaye the ki unhone kore kaagaj par hi dastakhat kar die
 The mlas were kept captive there for much of the night, at which time the BSP mlas were being held in the extreme house in such a way as to take the chickens to the butchers, in front of the set 1-2 of the rooms, Where Mayawati was sitting with some mlas
 ek vicitra naatak ghatit ho rahaa tha, baahar kii bheed se kuch-kuch vidhayak batch kar nikal aae the or unhone unheen kamaron me chhipane ke liye sharan le lee thi
 The last senior BSP leader to come in was RK Chaudhary, who was rescued under the supervision of constable Rashid Ahmed and Chaudhary's personal guard Lalchand
 kamaron main chhipe vidhayakon ko lalchand ne darvaaj andar se lock karne kii hidaayat di or unhone abhi daravaaje band hi kiye the ki bheed main se ek jhund galiyare main dhaddhadata hua ghusaa or darwaja peetane laga
 Mayawati was rescued by two junior police officers Himmat
 ye the vijay bhushan, jo hajratganj stesan ke house afasar (esechao) the or subhash singh baghel jo esechao (viipi) the, jinhone kuch sipaahiyon ko saath le kar badi mushkil se bheed ko peeche dhakela
 Then they all stood in queue in the corridor so that no one could cross them
 krodhit bheed ne phir bhi naare lagaana or gaaliyaan dena chaalu rakhaa or mayawati ko ghaseet kar baahar laane kii dhamkee detii rahi
 Apart from this courageous and timely action of some police officers, most of the officers present, including the handlers and security staff at the state guest house, made no attempt to stop the madness
 yah sab ek ghante se zyada samay tak chalata rahaa
 The statements of several BSP mlas and some police officers were shocking that while senior mlas of Lucknow OP Singh were also present at the time when the mlas were being kidnapped and Mayawati's rooms were under attack
 chashmadidon ke anusaar ve sirf khadey hue cigarette phoonk rahe the
 Immediately after the invasion began, the guest house's electricity and water supplies were cut off - another sign of the administration's collusion
 lakhanu ke jila magistrate ke vahaan pahunchane ke baad hi vahaan ki paristhiti main sudhaar aayaa
 He showed the courage and awareness of combating the angry mob
 espi rajeev ranjan ke saath milakar jila magistrat ne sabase pehle bheed ke un sadasyon ko atithigrih ke daayre ke baahar dhakela, jo vidhayak nahin the
 Later on the arrival of additional force organizations of the police, he got all the SP mlas, including the mlas, out of the purview of the state super-house
 yadhyapi aisa karne ke liye unhe vidhayakon par lathicharge karne ke hukum kaa sahaara lenaa padaa
 Still, he ignored the warning received from the Chief Minister's office not to take action against the SP members of the Assembly, and he stood by his decision
 apni duty bina dare or pakshpaat na karne ke falswaroop raat ko 11 baje ke baad jila magistrate ke liye tatkaal prabhavi rup se tabadale kaa hukum jari kar diya gaya
 The comments jaise hi rajyapal ke karyaalay, centre sarkaar or varisht bhaajapa netaaon ke dakhal dete hi zyada se zyada raksha dal vahaan pahunchane lage, atithi grih ke andar kii sthiti niyantrit hoti gai
 When the defenders took in and out of the building, the crowd started shouting, shouting slogans, threats and slogans
 mayawati or unke party vidhayakon ke samooh ko jinhone apane aap ko kamare ke set 1-2 ke andar band kiya hua tha, yakeen dilaane ke liye jila magistrate or anya adhikariyon ko baar anurodh karnaa padaa ki ab khatra tal gaya tha, or ve darwaja khol sakate the
 By the time they opened the door, it had been quite a night
 isi ke baad se mivati or mulaayam singh ke rishte kharaab ho gaye
 Since then, there has been no alliance between the two parties neither pre-election nor post-election for 24 years
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki guest house cond se espi-bispi main hui dushmani kya apana rukh badalati he ? For information, let us know that Brahmadatta was a servant of Dwivedi Sangh and he also knew how to handle lathi, so he had a fight with armed goons with a stick
 yahi vajah he ki mayawati ne bhi unhen hameshaa apana bada bhai mana or kabhi unke khilaaf apana ummidavaar khadaa nahin kiya
 Mayawati continued to oppose the BJP across the state, but campaigned for Brahmadatta Dwivedi in Farrukhabad
 kaha jaataa he ki jab gundon ne baad main brahmadatt dvivedi kii goli markar hatya kar di tab mayawati unke ghar gayi or foot-foot kar royee
 When her widow contested the election, Mayawati did not field any candidate against her, but appealed to the people to vote for my brother's widow who was martyred by taking hostility to save my life
 kuch reporton ke anusaar cheekh-pukaar machaate hue ve (samaajawaadee party ke vidhayak, kaaryakarta or bheed) ashleel bhashaa or gaali-galouj kaa istemaal kar rahe the
 The mlas sitting in the Common Hall (bahujan Samaj Party mlas) quickly closed the main gate, but the herd broke it open
 phir ve asahaay basapa vidhayakon par tut pade or unhen thappad maarane or latiyaane lage
 It is said that at least five BSP mlas were dragged and forced into vehicles on the outside of the guest house which took them to the Chief Minister's residence
 in vidhayakon ko raajbahadur ke netritv main basapa vidrohi gut main shaamil hone ke liye or ek kaagaj par mulaayam singh sarkaar ko samarthan dene kii shapath lete hue dastakhat karne ko kaha gaya tha
 Some of them were so scared that they signed it on blank paper
 vidhayakon ko raat main kaaphi der tak vahaan bandi banaae rakhaa gaya, jis samay atithigrih main basapa vidhayakon ko is tarah se dhar kar dabocha ja rahaa tha, jaise murgiyon ko kasaai khaane le jaaya ja rahaa ho, kamaron ke set 1-2 ke saamne, jahaan mayawati kuch vidhayakon ke saath baithi thim
 a strange drama was happening, some mlas escaped from the crowd outside and took refuge to hide in the same rooms
 andar aane vaale aakhri varisht basapa netaa aarake choudhary the, jinhen sipaahi rashid ahamed or choudhary ke nijee rakshak lalchand kii dekharekh main bachaa kar laae the
 The mlas hiding in the rooms were instructed by Lalchand to lock the doors from inside and they had just closed the doors so that a mob from the crowd roamed the corridor and started banging the door
 mayawati ko do kanishtha police afasaron himmat ne bachaaya
 These were Vijay Bhushan, the House Officer (SHO) at Hazratganj station, and Subhash Singh Baghel, who was the SHO (VIP), who took some of the soldiers along and pushed back the crowd with great difficulty
 phir ve sab galiyare main kataribaddh hokar khadey ho gaye taaki koi bhi unhen paar na kar sake
 The angry mob still kept shouting slogans and abusing and threatened to drag Mayawati out
 kuch police afasaron kii is sahaspurn or samayik kaarywahi ke alaava, zyaadaatar upasthit adhikariyon ne jinamein rajya atithi grih main sanchaalak or suraksha karmchaaree bhi shaamil the, is puure paagalpan ko rokane kii koi koshish nahin kii
 This all went on for over an hour
 kai basapa vidhayakon or kuch police adhikariyon ke ye bayaan stambhit karne vaale the ki jab vidhayakon ko apharan kiya ja rahaa tha or mayawati ke kamaron ke akraman ho rahaa tha, us samay vahaan lakhanu ke senior suprintedent of police opi singh bhi maujuud the
 According to eyewitnesses, they were just standing and blowing cigarettes
 akraman shuru hone ke turant baad rahasyatmak dhang se, atithi grih kii bijli or pani kii supplai kaat di gai-prashasan kii mileebhagat kaa ek or sanket
 The situation there improved only after the District Magistrate of Lucknow arrived there
 unhone krodhit bheed kaa dat kar muqabla karne kii himmat or jaagrukta kaa parichay diya
 The District Magistrate, together with SP Rajiv Ranjan, first pushed the members of the mob outside the confines of the guest house, who were not mlas
 baad main police ke atirikt bal sanghathanon ke aane par unhone sapa ke vidhayakon samet sabhi ko rajya atithi-grih ke daayre ke baahar nikalava diya
 However, to do so, he had to resort to the lathi charge of the mlas
 phir bhi sapa ke vidhansabha sadasyon ke khilaaf kaarywahi na karne kii mukhyamantri ke karyaalay se mili chetavanee ko ansuni karke ve apane faisle par date rahe
 The transfer order was issued to the District Magistrate with immediate effect after 11 o'clock at night, as a result of not doing his duty without fear and favor
 tippaniyan As more and more defense teams started reaching the Governor's office, the central government and senior BJP leaders interfered, the situation inside the guest house was controlled
 jab rakshakon ne building ke andar or baahar kabja kar liya tab gaaliyaan, dhamkiyaan or naare lagaati hui bheed dhire-dhire kam hoti chali gai

 Since then, Mayawati and Mulayam Singh's relationship deteriorated

 ab dekhnaa yah he ki guest house cond se espi-bispi main hui dushmani kya apana rukh badalati he ? Swami Vivekananda formulated Yoga into four main streams
 pehla, gyaan yoga jo gyaan ko aatmsaat karne ke tareeke sikhaata he
 Second, Raj Yoga which enhances willpower
 teesraa, bhakthi yoga yaa bhaawanaaon kaa vigyaan
 Fourth, the path of karma yoga or karma
 gyaan yoga kaa swaroop prayogtmak he, na ki andh aasthaa, balki apni banaavat se hi yah jigyaasu yaa prashnakul he
 Actually modern science and jnana yoga are similar, as both are ways of discovering the basic reality
 raaj yoga yani apni ichhashakti ke bal par badalanaa, baduya or acha insaan bananaa
 Patanjali has given eight stages of Raj Yoga
 bhakthi yoga kaa kul matlab bhaawanaaon ko divine bananaa or un par niyantran hasil karnaa he
 Karma yoga transforms daily deeds into yoga — whether it is cooking, eating or writing
 yoga ke in sabhi alag-alag roopon kaa ek hi lakshya he—purnataa hasil karnaa or khud ko chetana ke zyada oonche str par le janaa he
 My mission is to implement all these forms of yoga in all areas of human activities and in the process take the society to a higher level
 yoga aadhunik vigyaan or technology ko disha de saktaa or brahmad ke sookshm ayaamon ko samajhane ke liye chizon ko is bhautik sansar ke aage or pare le ja saktaa he
 Actually yoga and modern science complement each other
 yah maine sabase yuva nobel puraskaar vijetaon main se ek—vaigyanik bryan josefasan—se siikhaa, jinhone 29 saal kii umr main yah puraskaar jeeta tha
 Seven years ago he came to London to attend one of my lectures on Yoga
 kaarykram khatm hone ke baad unhone mujhe bataaya ki ve niyamit yoga karte the
 i went to his house and was pleasantly surprised to see that he had books of science as well as books and Upanishads on him
 unhone mujhe bataaya ki inhone unhant kwantum physics or ganit se aage janaa sikhaaya
 He then came to India as a guest professor at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, taking a one-year study leave and learned to do mantras, meditation, postures and pranayam
 aayush mantralay main ham yoga ko madhumeh yaa diabetes kaa mukammal roganirodhak nidaan siddh karne ke liye shodh kar rahe hai

 ham ucch raktchaap, hriday rog, asthma, peeth kaa dard, maansik vikaar, anidra rog, motopa tathaa duusari bimariyon ke liye isi tarah ke shodh kaa mansuba bana rahe hai
 This will establish yoga as a scientific and prophylactic remedy for many types of diseases
 hamaara shodh vishaal data par aadhaarit he
 For diabetes, we investigated 2,50,000 people spread across 60 districts and found that 50,000 of them had diabetes
 unhen yoga sikhaaya gaya or teen maheene baad unki sehat main baari sudhaar aata dekha gaya
 Those who had the worst type of diabetes saw a drastic drop in their blood sugar levels, while those who had milder diabetes became better
 aayush main hamaari ek uplabdhi yah bhi he ki hamane visheshgyon se raay-mashvira karke kaaman yoga protocol banaaya he
 It is a 45-minute method which has yoga, pranayama, meditation and devotional yoga
 agar roj kiya jaae to yah vyakti kii shaareerik or maansik kushalta main acha-khaasaa badlaav laata he
 If 70 percent of our population starts doing postures and pranayam on a regular basis, then the country's health budget will come down drastically, because it will work to prevent diseases
 raashtra kii acchhee sehat hindustan ko duniya kaa number ek desh banane main badi bhoomika adaa kar sakati he
 Great yoga gurus like Baba Ramdev, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and many others are doing a great job of making yoga a part of everyday life of large sections of people
 hindustan or asal main puri duniya ko pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa abhaari hona chahie ki unki koshishon se 21 june ko antarrashtriya yoga diwas ghoshit karavaaya ja sakaa
 If yoga becomes a way of living internationally, then health budgets around the world will decrease and humanity will reach a higher level of consciousness

Why did the IB and Home Minister remain silent on Rahul's claim?

 pradhanmantri narendra modine 8 november 2016 ko jab 500 or 1000 rupee ke puraane note band karne kii ghoshnaa kii thi, tab cashles hone kii bayaar chal padi thi
 In the same wind, a village in Madhya Pradesh was first declared as 'cashless village'
 isaki ghoshnaa karne ke liye baqayada bade kaarykram kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 But after a year of demonetisation, cash is king in this village like other parts of the country
 har lenden cash menindia today kii ek team ne bhopal se 30 kilometre kii duuri par sthit badzira naam ke is gaanv kaa daura kiya
 During this time it was found that after one year of demonetisation, every transaction here is happening in cash
 cashles gaanv hone ke tamge kaa koi asar yahaan nahin dikhataa he
 After the big event, the Madhya Pradesh government declared Barjira as the first cashless village
 iske liye bada aayojan kiya gaya tha
 The state government in association with Bank of Baroda organized several programs here
 inamen pioes mashine or cashles lendane ke anya intjaam dikhaakar bataaya gaya ki aakhir kaise notebandi ke baad yah rajya kaa pehla cashles gaanv ban gaya he
 But now POS machines no longer appear, but the picture after a year is completely different
 cashles hone kii ghoshnaake dauraan jitani bhi pioes mashine dikhaai gayi thim, ab vah kahin bhi najar nahin aa rahi hai
 Every business transaction is now happening in cash
 gaanv ke ek kaarobaari anil tilak bataate hai ki cashles gaanv ghoshit hone ke kuch hafton baad hi bank pioes mashiinon ko waapas lekar chalaa gaya
 Some traders have returned these machines themselves
 kyonki log cashles lenden bahut kam karne lage the
 Now some people have POS machines
 Anil said that now only big businessmen keep POS machines
 unhone kaha ki ab koi cashles lenden nahin karata
 POS machines are of no use
 avyavashtha ne ghatai cashles lenden main ruchikashles lenden main logon kii ruchi kam hone ke peeche kai vajahe hai
 The ATM from Bank of Baroda here is also bad for weeks
 iske alaava cashles lenden ke liye graminon ko extra charge bhi bharna padataa he
 This had the biggest impact on farmers
 jinhen pement to check or artijies pement ke jariye kiya ja rahaa he, lekin unhen har cheez nagad dekar kharidni pad rahi he
 Shailendra, a farmer of Kargaon village, has to say that every transaction in the village is now in cash, but the sad thing is that the payment that is made to us is through check
 iske chalate fasal kii buvaai or kataai ke liye hamen karj lenaa padataa he
 We are facing a lot of problems due to cashless transactions
 'notebandi se kuch hasil nahin hua'gaanv ke kaarobaariyonka bhi yahi haal he
 He says that nothing has been achieved by demonetisation
 kaarobaari rohit sen kehete hai, '' zyaadaatar samay mahilaayein ghar main apane paas nagad bachaa kar rakhti thim
 Many important tasks were dealt with by this cash, but demonetisation has completely taken away that cash
 iske saath hi kaledhan ko pakadaney ke liye notebandi kii shuruyaat kii gai thi, lekin vah bhi puraa nahin hua
 In this way demonetisation has proved to be a complete failure
 ''notebandi ke kuch din baad hi kam ho gaya cashles lendengaanv waalon kii maane to notebandi ke baad jab is gaanv ko cashles gaanv ghoshit kiya gaya tha
 For a few weeks, the cashless village remained intact and for a few days people carried out cashless transactions
 lekin yah kuch dinon tak hi rahaa
 After that, all the people started transacting in cash again
 noida main ravivaar shaam haryana police ke inspector ke beton par sarerah firing kii gai
 One was killed and one is injured

 The deceased has been identified as Sachin Sangwan, a resident engineer
 apni car se greater noida pashchim ke goud city apartment ja rahe the or jab ve antipisi crossing ke paas pahunche to un par motorcycle savaar dohamalavaron negolibari kar di
 Police said that Sangwan was shot in the chest while Tarun was shot in his hand
 - input bhashaa Like religion, patriotism is a personal expression that is expressed in a very intimate way and that is why it has different meanings for different people like religion
 dharm kii hi tarah yah uttejnaakaari bhi ho saktaa he
 Deshprem is a gentle gesture and i believe it should be used very carefully in cinema
 maine jo pehali deshbhaktipurna film dekhi, vah thi kranti (1981)
 Surprisingly, seeing this, no sense of patriotism will awaken me
 us samay main bahut choti thi or mujhe lagata he ki bachapan main ham koi darshanik bhav grahan karne ke iraade se filmein nahin dekhte
 Watching a film in that era is like an internal experience of bliss, which affects you later when you grow up
 main jab badi ho rahi thi, us daur main deshprem kii rango-bu kaaphi alag thi
 For example, in large part of our childhood, the villains of such films were colonial rulers, Mughal or British
 schuli kitabon or filmon se ham ek jaisi baaten sikhte the
 And going back and watching movies of the '50s or' 60s, i have to try and remember their references
 us daur main hamen swatantraaa mili hi thi
 As a country we were trying to stand up
 hamaari arthvyavastha ekadam shuruaati daur main thi
 Songs like 'mere Desh Ki Dharti' and 'aye Mere Watan Ke Logo' became the heartbeat of the people as they were written with a specific intention — to instill a sense of self-realization among people
 filmon kaa samaaj se atyant sahjivi sambandh he
 The two learn from each other
 hota he
 Films reflect our time and in return society also absorbs many things from films
 isliye, jab '70 ke dashak main hamaare aarthik vikaas ke daur main mil mazdooron kii samasyaayein surkhiyon main thim to amitabh bachchan kaa 'angri yang main' vyaktitv lokapriy ho gaya
 What the movies talk about has a lot of connection with the era in which they are made
 cinema main deshprem bhi aanshik rup se film or uske nirmaataa kii samvedansheeltaa ke anusaar hi aakaar letaa he
 Take Lagaan (2001) for example
 isamen british shaasha spasht rup se shatru the, lekin gramin apni garibi se bhi lard rahe the
 They were also fighting drought
 film ke antim hisse main ve jab cricket match jitate hai to unki khushi kii vajah sirf yah nahin he ki unhone angrejon ko haraa diya balki usamen apni pratikultaaon ko haraane kaa sukh bhi shaamil he
 His pride is a manifestation of the human spirit
 unki uplabdhi kisi tuchh or naganya samajhe jane vaale ko chamakane kaa mauka milane kii he
 For me Lagaan was not just a film showing patriotism
 yah logon ke saahas kii katha thi
 When i started working on Raazi (2018), i never thought that i was making any patriotic film while going through the processes of writing, cinematography, production and editing
 mere liye yah film durdamaneey maanviya bhaavana, dridhtaa, or yuddh kii nirarthakta kii kahani thi
 When we compiled the film for the first time, we realized that this film is saying so much more
 agar aap dhyaan den to aapako raji main kahin bhi bhartiya jhanda nahin dikhegaa
 Nor, will the national anthem or singing of 'vande Mataram' be heard as a background background throughout the film
 meraa iraadaa sachhee dridhtaa kii ek kahani dikhaane kaa tha
 i did not want to teach patriotic lessons with this
 iske mukhya charitra sahamat (aalia bhatta) kii ore jis baat ne mujhe khinchaa tha vah yah thi ki us jaisaa bhi koi kabhi is duniya main maujuud tha
 i think this character was a role model, an inspiration
 use dekhte hue aapmen gahare santosh or unnayan kaa bhav paidaa ho saktaa he
 i wanted to show her true story
 yah sanyog bhar he ki jab logon ne film ko dekhnaa shuru kiya or samikshakon ne samikshaayen likhni shuru kin to ham jin arthon ke saath ise le kar chale the, usase aage ke arth bhi khulne lage
 It emerged as a film that portrayed Desh Prem from a different perspective
 isamen dekha ja saktaa tha ki ugr rashtravaadi abhivyaktiyon kaa sahaara liye bina bhi aap deshbhakti ho sakate hai
 When we were writing the characters of the Pakistani family of Sehmat, we might have unknowingly made sure that their behavior, actions and decisions were not governed by nationalist influence
 isiilie jab aap in pakistani charitron ke saamne rakh kar sahamat ko dekhte hai to vah aapako khalanayika lagati he
 That is what is destroying the whole family
 lekin jaise hi aap un vajahon kaa khyaal karte hai jinke chalate vah aisa kar rahi he to achaanak uske prati bhaavon kii nakaaratmakataa khatm ho jaati he
 As soon as the factors that motivate her are removed, she again seems to be the antagonist, not her Pakistani family
 'shatru paksh' ko maanviya banaae rakhte hue sahamat ko naitik rup se thik sabit kiye rakhana apane aap main chunauti thi
 This balance could have deteriorated a little when leaning towards anything
 bhavukta mujhe bahut pareshaan nahin karti, lekin jab dambh kisi bhaavana ke rup main phere lagane lagaataa he to mere bheetar kii ghanti baj jaati he
 If i am portraying the patriotism of Sehmat in the film, i should also speak about her husband Iqbal's love for her country
 ek kii deshbhakti duusare kii keemat par kyon ho? agar hamaare saath hamaara deshprem he, to hamen dusron ke deshprem ko bhi sweekaar karnaa chahie
 According to me, i do not have to hate any other country to love my country
 ant main, iraadaa hi vah cheez he jo sabase zyada mahatvapurn hota he
 When we made Talwar (2015), we did not want to get into any controversy
 ham keval kahani ke donon pakshon ko saamne laana chaahate the kyonki hamen lag rahaa tha ki is bare main jo samachar hamaare bich aae the ve asantulit the
 We had no solution
 ham keval sari jaankaree saamne rakhana chaahate the
 This is your intention, which i think is visible to everyone
 is lihaaj se deshbhakti kaa chithran bhi bilkul aisi hi baat he
 Whatever my portrayals of patriotism, my intentions have an impact on them
 mere liye mere desh kaa arth he mere log, meraa shahar or meraa vaataavaran
 It is certainly not an ideology
 apane desh ke prati prem vyakt karne ke liye mujhe apane chehre par tirangaa banavaane kii jarurat nahin he
 i believe that if i immerse myself in my work, then i can bring out a little something that can help improve this nation
 main jhanda fahraane yaa naare lagane kaa kaam nahin kar sakati
 i should not have to prove my patriotism in my films or in my life
 mujhe aisa karne ke liye kaha bhi nahin janaa chahie

 Congress party leader in North MCD Mukesh Goyal has questioned the information given by the MCD on the preparations made by the MCD regarding the cleaning of drains and drainage of water before the monsoon
 unhone kaha ki kamishnar kii ore se jo jaankaree di gai he wo asaliyat se kaaphi dur he
 Goyal said that he had sought information about the action plan prepared for the year 2018-19 but the department gave information for the year 2017-18
 iske alaava mukesh goyal ne dilli sarkaar ke peedblyoody vibhaag par bhi aarope lagaate hue kaha ki monsoon ko lekar sarkaar gambhir nahin he or uske dwaara abhi tak uske adheen naalon kii safai nahin kii gai he
 According to Kamgoel, cleaning of drains is not even half done, the monsoon is about to arrive in the capital Delhi, but no preparations have been made by the Municipal Corporation to tackle the monsoon
 goyal ne aarope lagaaya ki north emsidi main naalon kii safai kaa kaam abhi tak aadha bhi nahin ho paaya he
 The MCD does not have sufficient resources nor staff for this work, yet MCD is making big claims about preparations to tackle the monsoon
 mukesh ne bataaya ki north emsidi kamishnar madhup vyas kii ore se di gai jaankaree ke mutabik bade naalon kii safai ke liye emsidi ke paas mashine hi nahin hai or na hi sacshan va jait mashine uplabdh hai
 In such a situation, it can be estimated that what kind of cleanliness will be done by the MCD
 unhone maang kii he ki dams or ejineering vibhaag ke jo adhikari galat jaankaree de rahe hai unke khilaaf karrwai kii jaani chahie
 He said that the basic responsibility of the MCD is to clean it, which it has failed to fulfill, MCD is not serious about cleaning drains
 vahiin dilli sarkaar ke peedblyoody vibhaag ne bhi abhi tak apane adheen naalon kii safai nahin kii he jabaki peedbludi ke adheen dilli ke bade naale aate hai
 In which the dirty water of small drains of MCD is discharged from the colonies but due to lack of cleaning of big drains, the dirty water of small drains is not able to go ahead and as a result dirty water gets filled in the streets and streets of the colonies
 goyal ne emsidi se maang kii he ki centre sarkaar se milane walurban development fundki raashi or modi sarkaar ke svachh bharat mishan ke tahat saaf-safai ke liye milane vaale fund se safai ke liye mashine or anya upkaran kharide jaaen

 is baat par bhi charchaa honi chahie ki falaan product ko kis slab main rakhane se kya phaayde hai or kya nuksaan
 We did not raise any tax in our budget, instead we reduced taxes on many products

 The Paper Merchants Association has suggested that all types of paper and board be kept in the 12 percent category of GST
 abhi tak ajukational books auki kaapiyon par tex nahin lagata he
 In addition, the input output must be differentially forwarded
 saath hi dilli main tex kii libility vikreta vyapaaree kii honi chahie

 yon shoshan ke aaropon main jail kii hawa kha rahe asaram ke purv sadhak or vaidya amrit prajapati ne gujarat sarkaar par gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 In a letter to Chief Minister Narendra Modi, Prajapati has claimed that the Gujarat government has made Asaram bigger than the law in the state
 apane patr main prajapati ne modi sarkaar par aarope lagaaya ki wo asaram or uske saadhakon ko suraksha pradaan kar rahi he
 Prajapati, who had worked as an Ayurvedic doctor in Asaram's ashram for many years and once a seeker of Asaram, alleged that the Gujarat government had not conducted a fair investigation in the cases registered against Asaram in the state
 apane is patr main prajapati ne narendra modi ke saamne ye sawaal rakhe hai-asaaram kaa parivaar pakistan se aayaa he, to wo kisaan nahin he
 In such a situation whether the land of all the ashrams in Gujarat should be with the government? The government land was given to the ashram near Himmatnagar for a cowshed, but why no cowshed has been built there so far? Dipesh Abhishek, practicing in Gurukul, is suspicious After the death in the circumstances, his parents had raised suspicion of killing Narayan Sai, so why did the government not order the detection test of Narayan? A's FIR has directly accused Asaram of murder, why no investigation was done in this case? The Gujarat government has made Asaram bigger than the law
 isliye unke khilaaf koi kaarywahi nahin hoti he
 'prajapati is the same Vaidya who has claimed that Asaram is addicted to opium, he consumes opium daily, even he uses many medicines to increase the power of his sex

 It is worth noting that Aaj Tak had revealed how many Aadhaar centers of Jaipur are making Aadhaar cards for 500 to 600 rupees without any documentation
 desh ke har naagarik kii ek pukhta pahchaan kaayam karne ke liye aadhaar kii shuruyaat hai
 Whether it is to get a mobile connection or ration or to sit in the exam, the government has made Aadhaar number mandatory to identify as an Indian
 desh kii aantarik suraksha ke liye bhi ise majboot aadhaar mana gaya
 But due to such fake centers, the question arises whether Aadhaar is really the basis of the country or whether the Aadhar scheme has become unfounded? Aaj Tak's sting showed the shocking news that be it Bangladeshi nationals or Rohingya Muslims, all are becoming citizens of India without any documentation
 yah desh kii suraksha ke lihaaj se ek sharmnaak baat bhi thi
 Here is the story of the entire sting, for your information, we are putting the story of the sting here again, this will give you a complete idea of how some people are playing with the security of the country for the money
 hamaare ek parichit ne jab bataaya ki aadhaar card vaala unke ghar aa rahaa he, to maine poocha ki aadhaar card to iske liye nirdhaarit centre par banate hai, is par unhone kaha ki centre koun jayega, teen sau rupee main 24 ghante main banaakar ghar de jayega
 Hearing this, we were not sure that the Aadhaar number, which is the identity of every Indian, is getting home delivery for three hundred rupees
 unhone hamen ek massej dikhaaya jisamen likhaa hua tha ki aadhaar card banavaane ke liye hamase sampark karen
 When we called the number given, that person called us to a photo state shop under Jagatpura culvert in Jaipur
 ham vahaan pahunche to vahaan pehle se aadhaar number banavaane ke liye log khadey the
 a young girl from Bengal and a child from Bihar also came to get Aadhaar card, who did not have any document, but their Aadhaar card was being made
 ye najaara daraavna tha
 Without any documents, anyone was becoming a citizen of India by spending 500-600 rupees
 is desh kaa sabase aasaan kaam desh kaa naagarikta lenaa lag rahaa tha
 We started the conversation with the owner of the photo state shop as he was taking the money
 counter par paise le rahe dukaan maalik ne card bana rahe shaks ke bare main kaha ki bina kisi document ke card kaa rate vahi bataaenge
 Reporter- These are our acquaintances, they do not have any document, how much will be charged? Agent- Contact them for this
 iskaa rate vahi bataaenge
 Then we inquired further to check its veracity
 reporter -yahaan se banavaane kii kya guarantee he, card aae na aae?agent- aap net se nikalava sakate ho valid he
 Reporter - But what is the guarantee that will be right? Agent- This is me, my house, my registration
 reporter- lekin ye to athoraiced centre nahi he na
 Agent - But this machine is authorized
 varna main aisa kaam kyon karuunga, do paise ke liye
 Why should i ruin the honor, there is a lot of work, anyone will come and speak
 main galat kaam nahi karata
 That is why people come from far and wide, because i tell you what is wrong and what is right and what is the way to work
 bina document aadhaar ke liye 600 rupiske baad hamane usase poocha ki kya wo hamaare ghar par aakar bana degaa
 He asked how many people would be there
 hamane use laalach dene ke liye kaha ki 10-15 ho jaaenge
 After that 15 km
 dur vaishali nagar bhi aane ke liye taiyaar ho gaya
 Then we asked if we would make a new card without a document
 usne tapaak se bolaa haa bana duungaa, magar 600 rupee luungaa
 Reporter - 600 rupees without document and just 100 rupees agent - yes i will come from so far, oil will be spent, i will spoil the time
 reporter- kahaan rahete ho
 Agent - i am a reporter from Bassi, so you will feed it in Bassi
 agent- hareporter- bassi main aapkaa centre haiegent- centre nahin, main to camp mod main kaam karata hum
 We were not sure that the Aadhaar card could be made without any document
 hamane usase dubaara apni tasalli ke liye poocha
 After that we asked for his Aadhaar-linked identity, so he opened his Aadhaar website on his mobile and showed his complete identity
 agle din wo sara system lekar 25 ki
 i reached our place in Vaishali city far away
 vahaan aakar usne aadhaar banane kaa apana sara system set kiya or aadhaar bananaa shuru kiya
 First i asked him to change the address without giving any document and then asked a person to get a document card and he started making it
 do-teen aadhaar card banavaakar kamai karne ke baad vah sahaj hokar khulne laga tha to hamane usase baatcheet shuru kii
 Reporter- What is your link with Aadhaar? Agent- Meaning: Reporters- How are you connected to Aadhaar, have you got any card? Agent- Yes
 
 We have got the certificate, we are at home
 
 
 dukaan main laga he
 
 
 We get it only when registration is received
 hamaare anguuthe se hi khulata he
 Reporter- how much do you make in a day
 
 20-30 cards? Agent- No where now
 pehle bana lete the daily 100 tak bana lete the
 Reporter - then he used to earn 10 thousand daily
 agent- kahaan, aage bhi deni padati he company ko
 Reporter- Which company is it? Agent- Acharya
 
 Reporter- Which company is this
 agent- usee company kaa registration he
 Reporter - you are now taking 100-150 and 600, how much will you give to the company
 ab dacument main kami rahati he to usko banane ke liye company maangati he
 If there is any shortage, then ask for money
 reporter- jinka koi document nahi rahata he unka kaise dikhaate ho?agent- wo to ham karte hai
 
 jugad karte hai
 
 vah hamaare zyada sawaalon kaa jawaab dene ke mood main nahi tha
 But we were not interested in making Aadhaar card
 ham to jaananaa chaah rahe the ki chand rupee ke liye desh kisuraksha se khilwadkarne kaa ye sauda kaise ho rahaa he
 When we talked about making cards of Bangladeshis, he would get suspicious, so we took our driver from the same area to ask us questions
 driver ne poocha- apana contract number dena, hamaare paas 10-15 bangladeshi aae hai
 He said ok saaf tha ki paise ke laalach main wo kahin jaakar kisi kaa bhi card banane ke liye taiyaar tha
 Then we handled further
 reporter- inke do-teen bengali parichit aae hue hai, sab milakar 10-20 ho jaaenge
 No one has a document, so tell what you will get accordingly
 agent- prati vyakti 500 rupee se kam nahi luungaa
 Reporter - If you don't have a document, what will you show the agent - that's our haddock
 iske baad hamane aise kai logon kaa card banwaaya
 In fact, for those who do not have a document, they create address proofs themselves by making fake karyanama and affidavits and make a card
 hamane iske alaava kai dusre agenton se baat kii or sabhi paise lekar jaali document or bina document ke aadhaar card banane ke liye taiyaar ho gaye
 Many such agents are captured in our cameras, who are making fraudulent use of Aadhaar cards
 is tarah se aadhaar ke farjivade kaa khullamakhulla khel chal rahaa he or yuaidi samet rajasthan sarkaar so rahi he
 Just a week ago, when the issue of identification of the Rohingya Muslims came up, after investigation, the Intelligence of the Rajasthan Government has submitted a report to find out how all the documents of foreigners living illegally are made
 kaash intelligence vibhaag sarkaar ko likhane ke bajaae jaanch hi kar letaa
 The work that the government and the Intelligence Department is not able to do, we have shown how Aadhar card can be made by anyone by fraudulently

 co / mrjfwt1a39 The Vishwa Hindu Parishad has warmly welcomed the decision of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to install a 100 meter high statue of Lord Rama on the banks of river Saryu in Ayodhya
 CM yogi ne ghoshnaa kii he ki vah ayodhya main sarayu nadi ke tat par bhagwaan ram kiduniya kii sabase oonchi pratimabananaa chaahate hai
 VHP has said that if UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's plan lands on the ground, it will increase the pride of Ayodhya not only in the country but in the whole world
 VHP ke pravaktaa vijay shankar tiwari ne mangalvaar ko dilli main kaha, "ayodhya main agar bhagwaan ram kaa bhavy mandir banataa he to yah puure desh ke liye khushi kii baat hogi
 This will increase tourism in and around Ayodhya
 "ullekhneey he ki upi sarkaar is saal ayodhya main usee bhavy tareeke sedivali manaane kii taiyaarikar rahi he, jis tarah ayodhya ke logon ne bhagwaan ram ke lanka ko jitkar waapas ayodhya lautne par manaai thi
 There is bound to be a dispute over this proposal of UP CM Yogi Adityanath, because the statue of Lord Rama on the banks of Saryu where it is being talked about is just a few blocks away from the disputed site
 yogi sarkaar kaa yah prastaav isliye bhi charchaa main he, kyonki kuch hi din pehle upi sarkaar ne upi ke paryaton sthalon par jo pustika chhapavai he, usamen vishwa prasiddh tajmahal kaa zikr nahin he
 Vijay Shankar Tiwari of VHP says, "it is totally wrong to compare Taj Mahal to Lord Rama, because Lord Rama is a symbol of faith of crores of people and Ayodhya is his birthplace
 "upi sarkaar ke is prastaav ko lekar isliye bhi sawaal uthaae ja rahe hai kyonki kuch hi maheene pehle gorakhpur ke aspataal main oxigen kii kami se bahut se bacchon kii maut ho gai thi jisko lekar khaasaa vivaad hua tha
 Now the question is also being raised whether the government has to make the idol more important than the maintenance of the hospitals? On this VHP says that if there is any shortage in the hospitals, then the UP government should also remove it, but The betterment of hospitals has nothing to do with the Ram temple issue in Ayodhya, as the administrative work and social work of the government are different

 In such a situation, some students from IIT Delhi have found an eco-friendly solution to this problem
 isse naa keval paraali jalaane ko roka ja sakegaa, balki kisaanon ko rice straw kii acchhee keemat milegi or plastic kii jagah paper kii chizon kaa istemaal kiya ja sakegaa
 In fact, Ankur, Kanika and Prachar, who were out of the iits last year, have designed a machine to convert rice straw into pulp
 phir isi pulp ko plates or anya iko-friendli teblevair banane ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 The steps are as follows
 
 
 > pehle paraali ko chote-chote tukdon main ek mashin ke jariye kaata jaataa he
 > Then this parali is washed in the washing machine of the house and dried with the help of a drainer
 yah step paraali kii gandagi ko nikaalane ke liye hota he
 > After this, the straw is added to the digester using eco-friendly or green chemicals
 > digester se nikali paraali behad mulaayam hoti he, jise beter main kuch ek ghante ke liye beet kiya jaataa he
 > After which the final pulp is prepared
 ek do chote-mote or steps ke baad is pulp ko teblevair companyj ke paas bheja jaataa he jo isse bio-degradable chijen banaati hai
 For such things, IIT students have made slogan 'eat-throw'
 students kaa kahana he ki is mashin ke jariye kisaan kareeb 5000 rupye prati acre bana paaenge
 This will be very beneficial for the farmers as they have been complaining that rice is not a market for straw
 2 se 3 mahino main students kaa daawa he ki is mashin ko market main utaara ja sakegaa
 a machine that will prevent the use of plastic along with burning stubble

 Thank you for having me @gqindia @ritssajdeha photo posted by @rohitsharma45 on Sep 27, 2015 at 7:16am PDT The film 'begum Jaan' tells the story of the partition of India and Pakistan, where a cell comes in the middle of the border and orders are disbanded
 is kothe kii malkin hai, begum jaan jo ise khaali karnaa nahin chaahatin kyonki is 'begum jaan' ne kai besahaara or samaaj se satai hui ladakiyon ko sahaara diya he
 Vidya Balan is playing the role of Begum Jaan
 is film main vidya ke alaava ila arun, gauhar khan, ashish vidhyaarthee, rajat kapur, vivek mushran, chanki pandey or nasiruddin shah jaise kalakaaron ne ahm bhoomikaayen nibhaai hai
 Shreejit Mukherjee-directed film 'begum Jaan' is a remake of the Bengali film 'raj Kahini', which was produced by Shreejit
 'begum jaan' azaadi ke samay do deshon ke bich hue bantwaare ke dauraan ke kai dard main se ek dard ko bayaan karti he
 The film tells the story of the bravery of a woman named 'begum Jaan' who does not mind the bifurcation or independence, she just wants her home safe, where she has made her a family member by supporting many destitute girls and She runs the store
 film main kuch achche dialogs hai
 There are some painful songs
 desh ke bantwaare ke samay do doston ke alag hone kaa gam bhi he
 The comments beshak- 'begum jaan' kii bhoomika main vidya baalan ne jaan daal di he
 Many scenes in the film are heart touching, but the biggest weakness of this film is that it is very loud
 manoranjan kam he
 Excessive drama is created and there is excessive dialogue
 kai seen main jabardastee ke ladaai-jhagade bhi maaloom padate hai jaise khaanaa khate samay kothe kii ladkiyaan aapas main lard rahi hai
 How the song of Holi comes suddenly in the film is not understood
 film kii lambaai bhi mujhe zarurat se kuch zyada lagi
 The first scene in the film 'begum Jaan' depicts that in 2016, some goons on a bus in Delhi attack a girl, try to rape her and an old woman saves her from a strange style and from here the film Goes in flashback, that is, the film is also telling that as women were tortured yesterday, so too are atrocities today
 film ke liye meri reating he 3 star, jisame aadha star vidya baalan ke jabardast abhinay ke liye he

 film ke liye meri reating he 3 star, jisame aadha star vidya baalan ke jabardast abhinay ke liye he
 Of course- Vidya Balan has given her life in the role of 'begum Jaan'
 film main kai drishy dil ko choote hai, lekin is film kii sabase badi kamazori he ki yah bahut hi laud he
 Entertainment is low
 zarurat se zyada drama creat kiya gaya he or zarurat se zyada dialogbaji he
 In many scenes, fights of coercion also appear as if the girls of the brothel are fighting among themselves while having food
 film main holi kaa gaanaa achaanak se kaise aa jaataa he samaj nahin aata
 The length of the film seemed to me to be a little too much

 ji haa, aath mahilaon ke khun kaa aaropee jaynandan baar-baar jail se bhaag jaataa he
 The funny thing is that every time his escape method is very unique
 jaynandan somvaar ko ek baar phir jail se bhaag gaya or tiruanantpuram kii police ne use dhundne ke liye raat-din ek kar diya he
 Jayanandan, along with Uppa Prakash, another prisoner, broke into jail
 police ko dhokhaa dene ke liye usne jail ke cell ke andar ek dami chhod di taaki lage ki vah so rahaa he
 Police say he managed to escape by breaking the lock of the cell with an iron cutter
 jaynandan par aath mahilaon kii hatya kaa aarope he, lekin use do maamalon main hi sajaa di gai he
 This time also Jayanandan found a unique way to escape from the prison
 usne isaki taiyaari bahut pehle hi shuru kar di thi
 He used to collect bamboo sticks and clothes present in the prison premises
 phir usne in chizon se rassi banaai taaki vah compound kii diwaar chadhakar faraar ho sake
 He managed to escape from jail according to his plan
 jaynandan isse pehle bhi jail se bhaag chukaa he
 In 2010, when he was in Kannur jail, he did a lot of dieting to get out of there
 vah kai dinon tak bhookha rahaa or phir itnaa patala ho gaya ki vah bina taala tode hi jail kii salaakhon se baahar nikal gaya
 He then escaped by leaping into the prison wall
 baad main use tamilnadu se giraftaar kiya gaya, jahaan wo apni patni ke saath rah rahaa tha
 Earlier in the year 2007 too, Jayanandan tried to escape by constructing a tunnel in the jail, but then he failed
