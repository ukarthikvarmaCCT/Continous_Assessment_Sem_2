yahi vajah thi ki dhimi aawaaj main suron ko saadhane kaa chalan hi nahin tha
 Today, with the help of modern tools, funkars can fill many colors not only in their voice but also in their voice
 kehane kaa arth he ki aaj fankaar apni aawaaj ko saamaanya yaa mand yaa behad mand rakhte hue bhi use jitne oonche sur main chaahe, utane main pesh kar saktaa he
 The essence of essence thinking is that "coordinate the best features of different houses, different gurus; The mood of the music is changing
 yah anand se bharaa anubhav hoga
 One has to go through the process of development to present something new
 ” purana chalan badal rahaa he
 It seems difficult to stay on the definition of pure notes or family
 pratispardhaa ke is daur main fankaar shoharat paane kii hode main kuch bhi karne par amada hai
 Who cares? At first the disciples lived with their master
 par aaj yah parampara khatm ho rahi he
 Today, the Guru does not go to music meetings with his disciples, whereas earlier masters used to go there and take stock of the preparations
 ve galatiyon kii ore ishaara karne se katai nahin chookte the
 Today, the masters themselves are roaming around the world, in such a situation, where should we take the time to pay attention to the disciples? But those who are devoted gurus are also avoiding showing mistakes
 shaayad koi bhi sambandhon main khatas nahin chahta
 This is the reason that agreements are being launched in the name of introducing new
 sitarvadak neeladri kumaar poochhate hai, ''ham sirf sangeet se hi aisi apeksha kyon karte hai ki yah paak-saaf or anushaasit rahe?” aaj guru-shishy parampara ne prashikshan camp vyavastha ko janm diya he
 The disciples go to gurus like Pandit Jasraj, Pandit Rajan Sajan Mishra, Pandit Hari Prasad Chaurasia, live together, learn music and then leave
 vaise vaadya kalakaar hameshaa ek jagah se duusare jagah ke safar par hi hote hai, isliye unke chaatro ko apane guruon kaa saannnidhya bahut zyada nahin mil paata jabaki hunar ko nikhaarane ke liye yah jaruri he
 This is making the situation worse
 aaj saare gharaanon kii chuni hui visheshtaon kaa bahurangi mishran pesh kiya ja rahaa he, ise alag karnaa sambhav nahin he
 In order to add to the identity of an emerging artist, 'gharana' is being coveted as prestige and style, even if it is not far from that house or in its style there is no flame of the house
 is jet yug main guru se seekhney kaa dhiraj or ekaagratha khatm ho gai he
 Just listen to the cassette, pick up some good things from here and there, prepare bandages of alapps by putting a patch / seam and start showering
 sangeet sikhaane ke rivaaj bhi badal gaye hai
 There are many instrumentalists whose disciples have to work hard to learn the best art of their gurus, but technology has helped them
 chaatr paath ricard karte hai or ghar le jate hai
 But it remains to be seen whether this custom is giving rise to the nobles? After years of living near the gurus, after refining their voice and musical style, with the permission of the Guru, a plant instead of the generation who sit for the stage on stage Who are taking personal training in an informal environment
 sangeet skulon yaa aadhunik gurukul ke parisaron main utsaah pankh failaae udaan bhar rahaa he
 Thanks to these talent shows, everyone is craving to do something extremely unique in their life and how will they be able to achieve it? First he will have to take basic education of classical music and after that he will have to go to the talent show
 itihaas main badlaav kii dastak sunai de rahi he
 Unlike the old generation, Fusion is not afraid of experimenting with new plants, trying out new genres and expanding its scope, whether it is dancer, funk or player
 madhyam alag-alag ho sakate hai
 For example, at a function in Delhi recently, the paintings of Niren Sengupta, Alka Raghuvanshi, Sridhar Iyer, Manisha Gawade and Sanjay Bhattacharya were printed on sarees, stoles and ties
 unki kritiyon ko crepe sadiiyon par chapa gaya tha or unhen fishan sho ke jariye pesh kiya gaya jisamen madhavi mudgal, uma sharma, kaushalya reddy jaisi nrutyaangnaayen or madhup mudgal, shubhendra raav, abhaya rustam sopori jaise vaadya kalakaar ramp par chale
 And know who was the show stopper! Great dancer Pandit Birju Maharaj
 uske pehle dhrupad gayak vasifudin dagar or pandit hari prasad chaurasia bhi fishan shoj main kaarykram pesh kar chuke hai
 Today, it is not considered bad to become a judge of maestro or dancers in reality shows or film shows
 badal rahe samay kii aahat spasht sunai de rahi he or kalakaar bhi khush hai ki unhen apni audiyans tak pahunchane kaa mauka mil rahaa he
 His lifestyle is also taking a different form
 aaj unhone khud ko sangeet kii barhakhadi sikhaane kii bhoomika main baandh nahin rakhaa he
 They are roaming the world, lecturing in foreign universities, presenting programs
 unka dayera bad gaya he
 They are not only seen presenting their art on stage, but they also meet them on page 3
 aaj kisi lounj main sharaab ke daur ke bich halke-phulke shastreey sangeet kii peshkash se qayaamat nahin aati
 Collaboration and band music maharathis are on a high, but the new generation is still waiting for pure classical music meetings
 aise main ubharate vaadya kalakaar yaa nartak-nrutyaangnaayen kya karen bhala? aisi asamanjas kii sthiti main hi unhone ek nayab tarika nikaala he
 Together with players of diverse genres, they are giving birth to a new multicolored form of music, be it Hindustani or Western; Or making a band
 masalan kamaal sabari kii saarangi fank, neeladri kumaar kaa sitar fank
 It is just to what extent do you liberate the creator inside you to fly
 haalanki colaboraton kii baat nami sangeetkaaron ke liye thodi atpati lagati he
 Noted Santurist Pt
 sivakumar sharma kehete hai, ''dekhie, sangeet to badalegaa, beshak
 But the music association over email is beyond my comprehension
 ”technologytechnology ke vikaas ke kaaran aaj sangeetkaar duusare vaadya kalakaaron ke paas baithe bagaiyr sangeet rach rahe hai
 The tune reaches them through the mail, so that they make their own preparations and when the time for the last recording comes, everyone gathers in the studio
 aisa pehle kabhi sochaa bhi nahi ja saktaa tha
 Instrumental artists previously did not use the net to show their skills
 aaj har vaadya kalakaar kii apni website he jisamen unhone apane bare main sara byoraa de rakhaa he
 This is such a powerful tool through which you can show your ability to the whole world
 hamaare jamaane ke mulyon main amul badlaav dikhaai de rahe hai
 Life is running fast and with this society, culture and economic aspects are showing profound changes
 koun aashwast kar saktaa he ki gharaanon kii mahak barkaraar rahegi? aagat kii kalpana sahamaa de rahi he ki badlaav kii aandhi sab kuch mitaa na de
 Listen with heart dilli kii maanav vikaas report shanivaar ko jari kii gai
 Its name is Vikas Report, but the reality is that Delhi has problems on every page
 kaise krime or khastahal sadakon ne jeena muhaal kar diya he
 The Human Development Report of Delhi counts where Delhi is lagging behind
 hamid ansaari ne un chunautiyon kaa bhi zikr kiya jo dilli ke saamne hai
 Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit had claimed in the Assembly on Saturday that in 15 years, the Congress changed the face of Delhi, but the Human Development Report opened up all the questions
 report main kaha gaya he ki bachche bujurg mahilaayein koi dilli main mahfuj nahin he
 90 per cent of the people say that crime has increased here, two-thirds say that the roads are deficient, the conditions in the slums are worse
 yahaan ke 56 fisadi bachche khule main shouch karte hai
 Slum areas do not have water and toilets
 shiksha yaa naukari ke maamle main mahilaon se bhedbhaav hota he
 The number of homeless people is increasing and Ranbasere is in a bad condition
 maanav sansaadhaan vikaas report jari hone ke maukey par in sab talkh sachchaaiyon se muhan churaakar mukhyamantri daawey karne se khud ko roak nahin pai, lekin report main khuli pole kii baat hui to maamla taalkar aage bad gayi
 The terrorist attack in Uri in Jammu and Kashmir is getting a strong response across the country and now the demand of strict action against Pakistan is also being raised by the BJP mps
 bijepi ke purvi dilli se saansad mahesh giri ne bhi is baat ko mana he ki ab sirf baton yaa shabdon se pakistan maanane vaala nahin he
 'PAK has no courage to strike from the front' According to Giri, other methods should be adopted to teach PAK a lesson
 mahesh giri ne kaha ki aane vaale dinon main aisa hoga bhi

 agar pakistan main himmat hoti, to saamne chaati karke ladata

 chunaav ke pehle piem modi ke pakistan ke khilaaf sakht karrwai karne ke vaadon ke sawaal par mahesh giri ne kaha ki ye piem modi kii hi sakhti kii asar he, jo pehle jaise hamaare javaanon ke sir kalam kiye ja rahe the, un ghatnaon main kami ai he
 'soon will be seen the impact of India's toughness' Giri said that on many occasions PM has given a strong message to Pakistan, but after the incidents like Uri, a decision has to be taken before taking action against Pakistan and the Modi government will take strong steps 
 giri ne kaha ki aane vaale dinon main is sakhti kaa asar dikhegaa

 Muslim witnesses also admitted that both sides worshiped there
 sijeai ne kaha, 'ranjan gogoi ne kaha ki ASI kii report ke mutabik khaali jameen par masjid nahin bani thi
 At the same time, evidence is presented that Hindus worshiped in the outer shrine

 '' dow apije abdul kalam ke purv sahaayak srujanpal singh ne fasebuk par ye post daali he, jisamen unhone kalam sahab ke saath bitaye antim din or palon ko yaad kiya he
 He went to IIM Shillong with the former President
 padhie is post ke kuch ansh
 
 - mujhe hawa main hone vaali halchal se bahut dar lagata he
 When the plane going to Shillong began to wobble, my condition started to deteriorate, Kalam sir looked at me and lowered the window in the window and said, "now you will not be afraid
 " Kalam sir was going to give a lecture at IIM Shillong, in which he was going to talk about making the earth a better place
 gurdaspur hamale ke bare main sunakar unhone kaha ki lagata he insaanon kii banaai takat bhi dharti ko pradooshan jitna hi nuksaan pahunchaa rahi he
 If this happens, we will all have to leave the earth

 He asked me to prepare a surprise assignment which will be given to the children of IIM at the end of the lecture
 bacchon se teen nayab tareeke poochne chahie jisase sansad zyada upyogi or kargar tareeke se chal sake
 But then he said "how will the children be able to answer this when i do not have any solution for this

 Kalam said, "why is he standing? You will be tired like this
" ye to sazaa jaisaa he
 "despite all efforts, when the young man could not send the message of sitting down, Kalam saheb reached the IIM and thanked the young man who had no more left to say to the young man, he said" Sir for you So will stand for six hours
 " - Kalam used to call me funny guy, just this word used to change every time
 kabhi iskaa matlab shaabaashi ho saktaa tha to kabhi samajhie kii kuch gadabad ho gai he
 i fixed their mic and they told me "funny guy, all right?" i laughingly said yes
 bas ye unke aakhri shabd the
 After this he gave some two minutes speech after which a long silence took place
 maine unki taraf dekha, wo gir gaye the
 Srijan Pal Singh, former assistant to Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, posted this post on Facebook, recalling the last days and moments he spent with Kalam Saheb

 " - im shilong main kalam sar ek lacture dene ja rahe the, jisamen vah prithvi ko behatar jagah banane kii baat karne vaale the
 Hearing about the Gurdaspur attack, he said that it seems that the power created by humans is causing damage to the earth as much as pollution
 aisa rahaa to ham sabko dharti chhodani pad jaaegi
 - Dr
 Kalam was also angry with the blockage in Parliament
 unhone mujhase kaha ki ek 'sarprize asiment' taiyaar karo jo im ke bacchon ko lacture ke ant main diya jayega
 Children should ask three unique ways so that Parliament can run in a more useful and effective manner
 lekin phir unhone kaha "bachche iskaa jawaab kaise de paaenge jab iskaa koi hal mere paas hi nahin he
 "comments - unki namrata kaa ek or udhaaharan dekhne ko mila

 In front of us were three soldiers stationed in an open gypsy, one of which stood with a gun
 road jarney ke ek ghante biit jane ke baad dow kalam ne kaha "wo khadaa kyon he? aise to thak jayega
 This is like punishment

 " - kalam mujhe funny guy kahkar bulaate the, bas har baar is shabd kaa matlab badal jaataa tha
 Sometimes it could have meant that it could have been appreciated, sometimes something has gone wrong
 maine unka mike thik kiya or unhone mujhase kaha "funny guy,sab thik he?" maine hansate hue kaha haa
 These were just his last words
 iske baad unhone kuch do minute bhaashan diya jiske baad ek lambii khamoshi chaa gai

 com / kkhz252ptp ucchtam nyaayalay ne videshon main jamaa kaale dhan ke maamle kii jaanch or ise waapas laane kii disha main uthaae ja rahe kadamon par nigaraanee rakhane ke liye ek ucch stareey vishesh jaanch dal (esaiti) gathit kiya he
 The team will be headed by Justice BP Jeevan Reddy, a former Judge of the Court
 nyaayamurti reddy ke alaava is dal ke upaadhyaksh ke taur par nyaayalay ke purv nyaayadhish nyaayamurti em bi shah ko niyukt kiya gaya he
 a bench of Justice b Sudarshan Reddy and Justice SS Nijjar directed that a high-level committee constituted by the government be immediately joined by the SIT in the matter
 peeth ne sarkaar ko nirdesh diya ki vah un sabhi logon ke naamon kaa khulaasa kare, jinhen kaale dhan se jude maamle kii jaanch ke tahat adhikariyon ne kaaran bataao notice jari kiye hai
 The court, however, clarified that the authorities should not disclose the names of those who have not been questioned in the case of depositing money in foreign banks, including Lichtenstein Bank
 nyaayalay ne yah faisla jane-maane vakil ram jethmalani or anya logon kii yachika par diya he 
 The petition demanded the court to order the government to bring back the black money stashed abroad
 sheersh adaalat ne sarkaar ko aadesh diya ki vah esaiti ke gathan ke bare main fouran adhisuchana jari kare or sarkari adhikari is dal ke saath sahyog karen
 While giving the verdict, the bench gave several sharp comments against the central government for 'failing to take appropriate action against those who illegally deposited black money abroad
 kaale dhan ko ‘desh ke liye bahut zyada khatarnaak’ bataate hue adaalat ne kaha ki videshi bainkon main jitani maatra main kaala dhan jamaa hota he, vah kisi desh kii ‘kamajori’ yaa ‘narmi ’ kaa mote taur par paimaana mana ja saktaa he
 The bench said that this was a serious lapse by the government, which would have an impact on the internal and external security of the country
 The bench said, "we express serious objection to the steps taken by the government
 
 It is clear to us that the investigation was completely halted and only accelerated after the intervention of the court
 ’ peeth ne pune ke ghoda vyapaaree hasan ali khan ke maamle kaa sandarbh dete hue kaha, ‘isi adaalat kii ore se jor diye jane ke baad maamle kii uchit tareeke se jaanch kii gai
 'the court said,' more steps needed to be taken
 ’ adaalat ne yah bhi kaha ki uske is maamle main shaamil hone kii jarurat thi
 The bench said, "we said that it is necessary for this court to be constantly involved in this case
" ’ iske saath hi unhone esaiti ko aadesh diya ki vah kaale dhan se jude sabhi maamle apane haath main le le or nyaayalay main is bare main sthiti report daakhil kare
 The court asked the SIT to prepare a comprehensive action plan on how it would deal with cases related to black money and submit it before the bench
 esaiti gathit karne ke apane faisle ko nyaaysangat tehraate hue peeth ne kaha ki kai puraane maamalon main bhi adaalatein apane sanvaidhanik daayitv puure karne ke liye aise faisle detii ai hai
 The court said that it is not possible for him to be involved in the day-to-day investigation of the case as he does not have sufficient resources
 peeth ne kaha ki kaale dhan ke mudde ko gambhirtha se liye jane kii jarurat he or yah sarkaar kii praathmik jimmedaari banati he ki vah aisi sampada desh main waapas laane ke liye harsambhav prayaas kare or videshi bainkon main kaala dhan jamaa karne vaale logon ko dand de
 The court said that the unaccounted money going from the country to foreign banks shows the ability of the country and its officials to not collect taxes, which is their constitutional obligation
 peeth ne kaha ki videshi bainkon main ja rahaa dhan desh ko nuksaan bhi pahunchaa saktaa he kyonki iskaa istemaal avaidh gatividhiyon main ho saktaa he
 In an earlier hearing, the government told the court that it had formed a high-level committee headed by the Revenue Secretary
 isamen sibiai, khufia beuro, pravartan nideshaalay ke nideshkon, sibiditi ke adhyaksh, rajasav khufia vibhaag ke mahanideshak, maadak padaarth niyantran mahanideshak, videshi khufia karyaalay ke nideshak or videshi vyapaar ke sanyukt sachiv ko shaamil kiya gaya tha
 The procedure of this committee was questioned by the court in the May 12 hearing
 esaiti ke adhyaksh banaae gaye nyaayamurti reddy ko 1997 main sevanivritti ke baad 15wein vidhi ayog kaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya
 He was also made the chairman of the 16th Law Commission, but resigned from the post in 2001

 com / dndd6hzphw Bollywood's most energetic actor Ranveer Singh is celebrating his 34th birthday on 6 July 2019
 ranvir ke special de par bollywood sitaron se lekar bhartiya cricketrs ne bhi unhen berthde vish kiya he
 In all these Bollywood actress Alia Bhatt has wished her co-star Ranveer Singh in a very special way
 bataa den ki ranvir singh ke janmdin par aalia ne apane dost ke liye ek bahut hi sweet note likhaa he
 Alia has shared a beautiful photo of herself with Ranveer from the trailer launch of the film Gully Boy on her Instagram Story
 aaliy ne photo share karne ke saath-saath ranvir ke liye ek kute note bhi likhaa he
 Not only this, Alia has also told about Ranveer's nickname
 aalia ne note main likhaa, “ My most amazing brilliant Tutu
 
 May you continue to shine and dazzle
 
 You make us laugh, smile, jump and cheer every time you walk into a room, the big screen or our hearts!!! Happy Birthday to you special one
 Apart from Alia, many Bollywood celebs and Indian cricketers have also wished Ranveer a birthday
 bataa den ki aalia bhatta haal hi main boyfriend ranbir kapur sang neuyork se vekeshan manaakar lauti hai
 Alia will soon be seen in the film Brahmastra and inshaallah
 vahiin, duusari or ranvir singh ne 6 july ko apane janmdin ke khaas maukey par apni aane vaali film 83 se apana pehla luk share kiya he
 In this film, Ranveer is playing the role of former cricketer Kapil Dev
 film ke first luk main aap ranvir singh ko kapil dev ke avatar main dekh sakate hai, jo ki kaaphi impressive he
 This look is getting a lot of praise on social media
 uttar pradesh kaa amethi congress kaa majboot durg mana jaataa he
 The BJP could not distinguish this fort of Congress even in Modi wave
 haalanki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko amethi main gherne kii kavayad bijepi pichley paanch saal se lagaataar kar rahi hai
 For the first time after becoming Prime Minister in this episode, Narendra Modi reached Amethi, the political stronghold of the Gandhi family on Sunday
 unhone munshiganj kii indo-rus kii ordinance factory kii nai ikai kii aadharshila rakhi, jahaan AK-203 mordan rifl banaai jaaengi
 This is seen as part of the bjp's strategy of encircling the Congress president in his 'house'
 darasal amethi kii siyaasi mitti aisi he, jo sirf congress ke beej ko pahachaanati he
 Therefore, when the Gandhi family's seed is poured during the election season, the entire crop of opposition parties would be destroyed
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main rahul gandhi ke saamne bijepi ne smriti irani or AAP ne kumaar vishwaas ko maidan main utaara tha
 Despite riding on the Modi wave, the BJP was deprived of feeding lotus in Amethi
 iske baad bhi bijepi ne smriti irani ko modi sarkaar main mantri banaaya gaya
 Amethi Congress stronghold Amethi became a Lok Sabha seat in 1967
 tab se yahaan hue 15 aam chunaav or up chunaav hue hai, jinamein se 13 baar congress jiti he or 9 baar gandhi parivaar ke sadsy yahaan se saansad hai
 Lok Dal has won in 1977 and BJP in 1998
 bijepi se jeetne vaale sanjay singh ab congress kheme main hai
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi is the third time MP from Amethi parliamentary seat
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main kareeb paune chaar lakh ke margin se jeetne vaale rahul 2014 main smriti irani se kareeb 1 lakh vot se hi jeet sake the
 BJP has won the election on this seat only once
 2014 ke baad se hi bijepi smriti irani ke jariye rahul gandhi unke hi durg main maat dene kii ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he
 This is the reason why Smriti Irani is active in Amethi even after losing the Lok Sabha elections
 irani lagaataar amethi kaa daura kar rahi hai
 Not only this, many BJP stalwarts including BJP President Amit Shah, Yogi Adityanath have visited Amethi
 haalanki amethi ke siyaasi or raajnneetik sameekaran aise hai, jahaan rahul gandhi ko maat dena aasaan nahin he
 In Uttar Pradesh, the SP-BSP may not have aligned with the Congress, but in Amethi, it is with Rahul Gandhi
 yahaan sapa-basapa gathbandhan ne congress adhyaksh ke khilaaf ummidavaar na utaarne kaa faisla kiya he
 This has made the path of Rahul Gandhi easier
 maujuuda samay main amethi loksabhaa kshetra main sapa kaa ek vidhayak he
 Apart from this, the SP-BSP also has its own vote bank
 aise main rahul gandhi ke kile ko bhed paanaa bijepi ke liye aasaan najar nahin aa rahaa he
 The caste equation is the role of the Kingmaker, a Dalit and Muslim voter in the Amethi Lok Sabha seat in favor of the Congress
 is seat par muslim matadaata kareeb 4 lakh ke kareeb hai or takreeban saadhe teen lakh dalit voter hai
 Apart from this, there are close to two and a half lakh Yadavs, twenty-two lakh Rajputs and about two and a half lakh Brahmin voters
 iske alaava obisi main kurmi, mallaah or lodh matadaata bhi achche khaase hai
 With the support of the SP-BSP, the Congress is likely to go with the Dalit, Yadav and Muslim votes outright with Rahul Gandhi
 iske alaava brahman congress kaa paramparaagat voter hai
 To sway the Rajput voters, Rahul Gandhi gave Dr
 sanjay singh or emelsi deepak singh ko laga rakhaa he
 Such caste equations also appear in favor of Rahul
 vidhansabha or aam chunaav main antaravidhansabha or loksabhaa chunaav main voting trend main kaaphi antar rahata he
 Even in the 2017 assembly, the BJP was able to win four out of five assembly seats falling under the Amethi parliamentary constituency
 ek seat sapa ko mili he
 Congress may not open account in Amethi in assembly elections
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav main kya aise hi nattejey rahenge ye kahana mushkil he
 Hoping to feed the lotus to the BJP, the BJP is engaged in every possible effort to bring the electoral crop in 2019
 2014 ke chunaav haarane ke baad bhi kendriya mantri smriti irani lagbhag har maheene amethi aa rahi hai or kendra va rajya sarkaar kii yojanaon ke sahare vikaas ke kaamon ko aage badha rahi hai
 BJP is trying to capitalize on the development work done in this parliamentary constituency in the exercise of penetrating this fort of Congress in Lok Sabha elections
 antarrashtriya mudra kosh (imef) ne misr ko teen arab dollar kaa udhaar dene kaa faisla kiya he
 Egypt's Finance Minister Sameer Radwan said the Monetary Fund will approve this lending for the fiscal year 2011-12 starting in July
 radwan ne kaha ki udhari par byaaj kii dar 1
 5 per cent, which is generally less than the seven per cent interest charged by the IMF
 ravivaar ko jari ek bayaan main iemeef ne kaha ki yah udhari misr ke aarthik vikaas ke liye kii gai antarrashtriya sahaayta kaa hissaa he
 Egypt's economy had deteriorated significantly in February after a massive protest against then President Husni Mubarak
 misr ko vishwa bank se bhi 2
 $ 2 billion loan will be available
 sarkaarake liye aaj rajyasabha main us samay sharmindagi kii sthiti utpann ho gai, jab raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par dhanyavad prastaav par bhrashtachar evam kalaadhan ke mudde par vipaksh ke ek sanshodhan ko ucch sadan main manjuur kar liya gaya
 However, the Prime Minister rejected the allegations of being pro-corporate and diluting any pro-farmer provisions in the Land Bill
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne khaadya suraksha kanoon ke tahat aabaadi kawarej ko ghataane ke kisi faisle se bhi inkaar karte hue kaha ki yah kapol kalpana prachaarit nahin kii jaani chahie
 On the issue of black money, Modi targeted the Congress and said that his government did not set up a special investigation team as it was an attempt to save someone
 yechuri ne pesh kiya tha sanshodhan prastaavunhone samprag sarkaar kii yojanaon kii nakal kiye jane ke aaropon par kaha ki khud congress sarkaar ne atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar kii yojanaon kii nakal kii thi
 The government does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha and a deep embarrassment arose for it in the Upper House today when the House approved the amendment brought by the opposition on the motion of thanks on the President's address
 makapa sadasyon seetaram yechuri or pi rajeev ne yah sanshodhan pesh kiya tha
 The House accepted it after the division of the vote
 iske pehle sarkaar ne vipaksh se apil kii thi ki vah apana sanshodhan waapas le or mat vibhaajan par jor nahin de
 The amendment was approved by 118 votes against 57
 rajyasabha ke itihaas main yah chauthaa mauka he, jab raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par dhanyavad prastaav par vipaksh dwaara laae gaye sanshodhan ko sadan ne manjuuri pradaan kii he
 It happened for the first time during the Janata Party rule on 30 January 1980
 uske baad 1989 main aisa hua jab veepi singh nit rashtriya morcha sarkaar thi
 This was the third time on 12 March 2001, when the NDA government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee was in power
 sansadeey kaary mantri em venkaiya naidu ne yechuri ko sanshodhan par jor nahin dene kaa anurodh kiya or kaha ki kalaadhan kaa zikr kiya gaya he
 He stated that his concerns have been noted and should therefore be withdrawn
 naidu kii koshish nahin hui kaamyabanaidu ne yechuri ko sanshodhan par jor dene se rokane kii koshish kii or kaha ki sarkaar kaala dhan laane kaa prayaas kar rahi he or is mudde par koi do raay nahin he
 He requested Yechury, you have the right
 aapaki chintaaon ko samajha ja saktaa he, lekin aap mat vibhaajan par jor nahin dijie, lekin yechuri ne is anurodh ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 He said that under normal circumstances he would have agreed
 unhone kaha ki vah sanshodhan par jor de rahe hai, kyonki sarkaar ne koi chaara nahin choda he or vipaksh ko pradhanmantri ke jawaab par spashtikaran maangane kaa mauka nahin diya gaya
 He said, even the Leader of the Opposition was not given a chance
 unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi ke apana jawaab dene ke turant baad sadan se baahar jane par bhi aapatti jataai
 The amendment states that the speech makes no mention of the government's failure to overcome high level corruption and bring back black money
 taaja ghatnakram ne is baat ko rekhaankit kiya ki sarkaar ko apane pramukh aarthik sudhaar vidheyakon ko ucch sadan se paarit karaane main mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Amid the uproar, Congress's Ramchandra Rao showed a banner standing in his place
 is par sabhapati hamid ansaari ne aapatti jataate hue kaha ki unhen sadsy ko baahar jane ko kehane ke liye baadhya hona padegaa
 Later Rao agreed and sat on his seat
 kendriya mantri ravi shankar prasad ne kaha ki jahaan tak spashtikaran kaa sawaal he, iske liye kabhi anumati nahin di gai
 To this Yechury replied that as a member he is aware of his authority
 ansaari ne kaha ki agar sadsy mat vibhaajan par jor dete hai to asana inkaar nahin kar saktaa
 Earlier, while replying to a discussion on the motion of thanks on the President's address, Modi dismissed the opposition's allegation that his government was a corporate supporter
 unhone kaha ki unki sarkaar ne jandhan yojana, svachh bharat, mrudaa swasthya card se lekar sarkari skulon main ladakiyon ke liye shauchalay or sabake liye awaas jaisi kai yojanaayen shuru kii hai
 Will these programs benefit the rich or the poor? Indicating agreeable to the change in the controversial Land Acquisition Bill, the Prime Minister said that the provision of compensation of land to farmers has not been changed completely and if there is anything against it in the farmers, then it is ready to change it
 
 pradhanmantri ne rajyasabha main raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par charchaa ke jawaab ke dauraan bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak par vipaksh se sahyog kii apil kii jahaan sattarudh gathbandhan ke paas bahumat nahin he
 Modi said, this is the house of senior citizens and many concerns were expressed about the Land Acquisition Bill
 main pratham din se kahata rahaa hum ki isamen koi kamiyaan hai to use thik kar len
 If there are any shortcomings, we are ready to make necessary corrections
 unhone kaha ki pichley vidheyak main bhi hamane sahyog diya tha
 If he was good then do not give us his credit, but if there are any shortcomings then we are also partners of that sin
 pichley kanoon main jameen milane kaa praavdhaan prabhavi nahin tha, aise main skool, raksha pratishthan aadi ke vikaas kaaryon ko kaise aage badhaayaa jaataa
 Modi said, "if there is any thing against farmers, i am ready to change it
" agar koi kamiyaan hai to ise milakar dur karen or ise paas karen
 He also said that the food security law passed during the tenure of the UPA government is also being propagated
 unhone kaha sarkaar ne is yojana ke tahat kawarej aabaadi 67 fisadi se ghataane kaa koi faisla nahin kiya he
 It is not being done 40 percent
 aisa dushprachaar mat kijiye
 Targeting the Congress on the issue of black money, Modi said that the previous government did not set up a special investigation team in 2011
 aisa isliye hua kyonki yah kisi ko bachaane kaa prayaas tha
 Rejecting the Congress accusations against the government of bullying in the name of taking action against black money, Modi recalled the Emergency and said what could be a greater danger than that
 unhone kaha ki jab vah gujarat ke mukhyamantri the to unhen jail bhej dene kii dhamkiyaan di jaati thim
 In an hour-long speech, Modi compared criticism with the UPA government's tenure plans, denying the criticism that his government had not done anything in nine months

 ’ After the alliance between Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party in Uttar Pradesh before the Lok Sabha elections, the top leaders of the two parties are also going to hold joint rallies to woo the public
 akhilesh yadav or mayawati ek saath pradesh bhar main 11 reliyaan karne ja rahe hai
 However, a question arising about these shared rallies is why 9 out of 11 common rallies are being held in the Samajwadi Party stronghold
 gathbandhan kii ore se ghoshit kaarykram ke anusaar sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav, basapa pramukh mayawati or areldi pramukh choudhary ajit singh kii saajha reliyon kii shuruyaat navaratri ke shubh dinon main 7 april se hogi jo 16 may tak chalegi
 Among the common rallies being organized by the alliance, Mainpuri, Kannauj, Badaun, Firozabad and Azamgarh are the seats which are currently held by the Yadav family and half the shared rallies are being held in these seats
 11 saajha reliyon main se saharanpur or agra mahaj do aisi siten hai jo bispi ke cote main he, lekin 80 fisadi se zyada reliyaan sapa ke garh main karne kii vajah aakhir kya he?koi manmutav nahin!jaankaron kaa kahana he ki abhi tak yah charchaa aam he ki samaajawaadee party kaa votbank mayawati ke liye itani dridhtaa ke saath nahin khadaa hoga, jitna mayawati kaa votbank unke ek ishaare par samaajawaadee party ko vot kar saktaa he
 By rallying to family members and close family members like Mulayam Singh Yadav, Ram Gopal Yadav, Dimple Yadav, Azam Khan, Mayawati wants to send a message that their old differences with the Yadav family have ended and now the two have a good relationship and someone There is no estrangement
 duusari ore, bijepi pravaktaa rakesh treepathi ke mutabik darasal yah akhilesh yadav kii hataasha or chunaav kaa khauf he jo unhen mayawati ko apane or parivaar ke ilaake main reliyaan karaane ko majaboor kar rahaa he
 According to this BJP leader, sp's condition is that he wants to save at least his family seat and that is why more than half of the shared rallies are happening only in the area of SP
 rampur, faijabad, gorakhpur, varanasi, saharanpur or agra aisi site hai jo yadav parivaar se baahar hai, lekin aakhir sirf sapa ke liye mayawati kaa campan karnaa kya sandesh detaa he?mayawati kaa istemaal!bijepi netaa chandramohan ke mutabik pichhali baar modi lahar main samaajawaadee party ne apana kunba to bachaa liya tha, lekin is baar puure kunbe kii saakh daanv par he chunki mayawati khud nahin lard rahi hai or yadav parivaar ek baar phir maidan main he, aise main is duusari modi lahar main parivaar kaa bhi chunaav jeetna mushkil dikh rahaa he isliye samaajawaadee party kii puri koshish sirf parivaar ko bachaane kii he or isamen mayawati kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 However, regarding the rallies, Samajwadi Party spokesperson Sunil Sajan says that the selection of venues for the common rally has been decided based on the geographical situation
 bhale hi 11 main se 9 reliyaan samaajawaadee party ke kshetra main kii ja rahi hon, lekin agal-bagal kii siton par basapa chunaav lard rahi he or agar aage jarurat padi to alag se bhi saajha reliyaan kii ja sakati hai
 However, there is so much enthusiasm among the workers about this joint rally of SP and BSP
 yah to raily ke dauraan pataa chalegaa, lekin itnaa tay ho chukaa he ki samaajawaadee party gathbandhan ke baad ab mayawati ke takat ko sabase pehle apane hi ghar main aajamaa lenaa chaahati he

 Taking a dig at Modi, he said, "our leader Nitish Kumar has already said that the country will not tolerate leaders with communal ideology
" mujhe khushi he ki desh ke saath-saath bijepi bhi hamaare is vichaar se sahamat he

 ishaaron hi ishaaron main shivaraj singh chouhan ko modi se behatar bhi bataa daalaa
 Advani said at the conclusion of the conference of the parents and convenors of the town-village centers that Vajpayee, during his tenure (when Vajpayee was the Prime Minister) with the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, construction and upgrading of national highways, nuclear testing, Kisan Credit Card They started many schemes but always stayed away from arrogance

 On such an occasion, when the BJP executive meeting is going to be held in a week, this statement of Advani cannot be made at all

 The revelation of such a honey trap: In fact, last week, Indore Police arrested two women and their driver
 ye mahilaayein nagar nigam ke ejeeniyar harbhajan singh kaa video banane ke baad use blackmel kar usase teen karod rupee maang kar rahi thim
 When they came to collect 50 lakh rupees as the first installment of the amount demanded, they were caught
 uske baad kai netaaon ke taar is cond se judate chal gaye or beete saat dinon main is cond se judi jo tasviir saamne aa rahi he, vah chaunkaane vaali he
 At the same time it is realizing that in the last several years in the state, contracts worth crores were handed over to those who made full use of women
 is maamle kii jaanch ab esaiti (vishesh jaanch team) ko saunp di gai he
 Along with this, the names of leaders of ruling party Congress and opposition party BJP have started joining this honeytrap sex scandal
 abhi tak kisi bhi netaa par police ne to ungali nahin uthaai he, magar galiyaaron main charchaa yahi he ki hanitrap sex cond kii mahilaon se netaaon ke rishte rahe hai
 The story of the inert trap sex scandal extends to other states and transcends state boundaries and is moving towards other states

 kuch din pehle ek varisht iees adhikari kaa video viral ho chukaa he

 On the other hand, former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh has tightened up on bjp's demand for a CBI inquiry, saying that the BJP people like Vyapam want to influence the investigation of the case through CBI
 kai netaa-afasaron kaa kariyar ho saktaa he barbadpulice ke haath jo suraag haath lage hai, ve is baat kaa khulaasa karte hai ki hanitrap sex cond main sirf paanch mahilaayein nahin hai, balki unke giroh ke sadsy chote jilon tak faile hue hai, jinka samay-samay par apane tarah se upyog kiya jaataa tha
 Previously, the contract or other work was made to please the concerned leader or officer and the money was used to collect money by threatening to blackmail him, which could not work

 This time, 44-year-old Akhilesh Yadav is facing a battle of 'strength' with his uncle Shivpal Yadav, just a few months before the very important assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh early next year, and till now Akhilesh's father And Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav is also seen supporting his brother instead of his son
 
 
 uttar pradesh ke 'pratham parivaar' main 'saarvajanik rup se' jari 'jang' ko lekar apni baat rakhte hue nitish kumaar ne kaha, "akhilesh ji raajnneeti kaa yuva cheharaa hai, or yadi vah uttar pradesh main sharabbandi lagu karne kii himmat juta pate hai, to unhen vidhansabha chunaav jeetne ke liye kisi ke samarthan or chhatrachhaya kii zarurat nahin padegi

 Nitish Kumar, who became the Chief Minister of Bihar for the third time in a row with the overwhelming support of women voters promising liquor ban last year, said, "nothing can be achieved without taking a threat, so unless you decide something big, big political goals
" Is not possible to achieve 
 
 " Nitish Kumar may seem to like Akhilesh Yadav, but his attachment and support for Akhilesh's father, Mulayam Singh Yadav, is not the same as he got "messed up" during the Samajwadi Party's electoral alliance in Bihar last year

 Speaking about the 'war' continued 'publicly' in the 'first Family' of Uttar Pradesh, Nitish Kumar said, "akhilesh ji is the young face of politics, and if he could muster the courage to introduce liquor ban in Uttar Pradesh
 If they are, they will not need anyone's support and canopy to win the assembly elections
 
 
 " Nitish Kumar clearly said that if Akhilesh Yadav declares liquor ban in UP, he will not hesitate to support him

 In fact, Mulayam Singh Yadav shied away from the anti-bjp grand alliance formed under Nitish's leadership at the last moment, saying that his party was not being given enough seats to fight
 tippaniyan Now on Monday, Nitish Kumar said, "mulayam Singh and his party have got someone's badass for cheating us last year

 com / jxu5bjnvo7 Insurgents in Libya have captured Gaddafi's Camp bab-al-azizia and hoisted their flag there
 vidrohiyon ne karnal gaddaphi kii murti tod di he
 Rebels break another well-known symbol depicting an American ship holding a golden fist in the eighties in memory of an American airstrike on Colonel Gaddafi's premises, which was built by Colonel Gaddafi from this place
 Used to give message to is puri karrwai ke dauraan gaddaphi or unka parivaar nahin mila abhi tak kisi ko is bare main koi jaankaree nahin he ki wo apane puure parivaar ke saath kahaan hai? gaddaphi ke campus main kabje ke baad vidrohiyon ne goli chalaakar apni jeet kaa elaan kiya he
 The rebels in Libya are celebrating their victory over Gaddafi's loyal army
 rajdhani tripoli ke central green square par badi sankhya main vidrohi jamaa hue or hawa main goliyaan dagkar apni khushi kaa izhaar kiya
 The rebel soldiers and their supporters were shouting slogans
 unhone america or pashchim deshon ke samarthan main bhi naare lagaae
 i lived in Lucknow for many years
 1980 or 1990 ke dashak ke dauraan chote shaharon main rahane kaa matlab tha ki hameshaa dupatta lapete raho or koshish karo kildakon se pangebaajiki naubat na aae
 i was a little different from ordinary girls, so at a time when my fellow students started experimenting with sex, i was trying to understand Shakespeare deeply for my tenth exam
 ham'sef time', sex kii agali subah lee jane vaali goliyon yaa duusare garbhanirodhak upayon ke bare main nahin jaanate the
 Abortion used to be a shameful thing that girls at my convent school would pick up with chatter, "hi, you heard? Who went to the doctor in the past? "I was foolish enough to know that a woman like this must have gone to the doctor in a state of mental illness
" par aaj! yani 20 saal baad bhi sthiti main koi khaas badlaav aayaa nahin dikhataa he
 Girls experiment with sex, but they still hesitate to discuss it
 ve yah bataane se ab bhi parhez karti hai ki ve ahnat kunari nahin
 The boys have hardly any knowledge about all this
 haalanki ikkaa-dukka skulon main yon shiksha lagu kii gai he lekin inase koi dhang kii jaankaree nahin milti
 Yes, they have so much knowledge that "always use condoms and be restrained
" '' lekin aisa bhi nahin ki jaankariyaan un tak nahin pahunch rahi hai
 Erotic videos, saved in the folder of porn and laptops available on mobile, have taught the new generation a to z of sexual relationships
 ab mushkil yah khadi hoti he ki jo kuch dekha usamen maahir hon bhi to kaise? kyonki sex mahaj ek kriya bhar nahin balki ek bhaavnaatmak cheez he
 Instead, in a society that is suffocating in the clutches of tradition
 is maamle main chote shaharon or mahanagar ke mardon main bada halkaa-sa fark he
 And women are not far behind
 nilsan-india today sex survey ke anusaar, chote shaharon main purush date par nahin jate
 This shows why most of the boys in Lucknow are seen standing at the tea shops staring at the girls, but they cannot afford to ask any girl to walk with them
 hindustan main ham sex ke bare main baat nahin karte, balki ise aisa vishay maanate hai jise apane tak hi rakhaa janaa chahie
 We learn about sex from the internet or friends
 dost bhi aise jo khud bhi kya jaanate honge? lihaaja desh ke ladke auraton kii jarurat ke bare main adhakachari jaankaree ke saath bade hote hai
 By the time they reach the age of 19, most boys and girls in small towns or metros have 'fallen in love' and want to marry them
 20 se 25 saal kii umr tak zyaadaatar log aise hi chakkaron main uljhe rahete hai or unke jivan kaa pehla shaareerik sambandh suhagaraat ko banataa he
 Some get hurt in love and get married to another girl in their life
 kai saathiyon ke saath sambandh banane kaa fitur chote shaharon ke mardon ko nahin bhaataa
 He also does not know the art of attracting women
 ise baar-baar karnaa unke liye kathin he
 So they choose an easy path
 vahi jo unke pita karte aae hai
 They give money for household expenses and maintain family peace by obeying the wife
 yah ek myth he ki purushon ko kai saathiyon kii jarurat hoti he or jimmedaari uthaane se unhen dar lagata he
 They are not like this at all
 unka ek hi sapana hota he ki unke jivan main solah kala main daksh ek samajhadaar kanya aae or unke saare dosha ke saath use apana le
 The desire to have a beautiful and intelligent wife sometimes fades the virtue of a woman's intelligence and warmth and sits at the top of a man's list
 aisa isliye ki tab hi ve apane bagal main khadi buddhipradipt saundarya shalaka ke garvile pradarshan se anya logon ke dilon par chhuriyaan chalaayenge
 Most men in small towns stay single until they get married
 unki patni hi unki sex partner hoti he or agar vah tan-man se sex ke liye taiyaar he to ve santusht rahete hai
 Surprisingly, the image that sits on his mind as an ideal sexual partner is his wife, not that of a film star or a player
 kalpanalok kii saiyr chote shaharon ke mardon kaa shagal nahin
 Today, while the new stages of progress and development are waving and we consider ourselves generous, how strange that a man from small cities or metros is still expecting his virginity from his wife
 yahi vajah he ki agar shaadi se pehle college ke dinon main apane kisi najdiki saathi ke saath koi shaareerik sambandh ho gaya tha to ladkiyaan aksar use chupa baithti hai
 She goes to some extent to save her 'image'
 mujhe yaad he ki loreto convent kii acchhee ladakiyon ne mujh par 'kamjor karactor or tejatarraar' kaa thappa laga diya tha
 The reason was so much that i would go to St
 Francis to pick up my brother, who was only a boys' school and talk to them there
 kisi ladke ko chumban dene or uske asar ko mahasoos karne se pehle hi meraa comarya bhang ghoshit kar diya gaya or koi mujhase shaadi karne ke liye taiyaar nahin tha
 In my mind i was thinking what a wonderful situation this is, but my mother was shocked
 survey main vahi tathy ubhar kar aae hai jo main jaanati thi: purushon ke liye sex hameshaa myne rakhata he
 Sex remains important even after a few years of marriage
 vaise agar unhen ise jeene kaa bharpoor mauka na mili to bhi koi malaal nahin
 Men in small towns have sex two to three times a week, while in metros
 chote shaharon main garbhanirodhak kaa chalan kam he, shaayad ve maanate hai ki ek hi saathi ke saath sambandh banaae rakhana sabase badi suraksha he
 There is no place for live-in relationships in small cities
 mahanagaron main bhi kuch purushon kaa maananaa he ki liv-in main rahane kii bajaay apane saathi ke saath dating karne ke baad shaadi kar leni chahie
 People still do not see sex as separate from emotion
 lihaaja kai saathiyon ke saath sahavaas karnaa aasaan nahin
 Most men in cities and towns have avoided extramarital affairs
 mahanagaron yaa shaharon-kasbon ke purush shaadi se pehle shaareerik sambandh bananaa jaij nahin maanate

 In fact, on this move of Shiv Sena, BJP leader Shaina NC had defended Modi and condemned the entire incident

 It is believed that this poster of Shiv Sena has come against War Jaitley's statement that he said that Shiv Sena should discuss issues instead of doing politics of sabotage

 RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has made serious allegations against Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and said that his government house 5, Desharatna Marg is being monitored through high CCTV cameras installed in the Chief Minister's residence
 tejasvi ne kaha ki sarkaar unki jasusi kara rahi he
 On this whole issue, Tejashwi Yadav on Thursday tweeted and shared a picture
 isamen saaf taur par dikh rahaa he ki unke sarkari awaas se lage mukhyamantri awaas ke diwaar ke upar ek sisitivi camera laga hua he jo mukhyamantri awaas kii suraksha ke liye lagaaya gaya he
 Tejashwi has alleged that installing CCTV cameras at such a height is only to keep an eye on his government residence
 Bihar cm’s residence is surrounded by main roads from 3 sides & Leader of Opposition's residence from the fourth side
 But CM felt the need for CCTV only on the wall bordering his political adversary's residence? Someone should tell him that these petty tricks will prove futile! Pic
 twitter
 com / hiszuew1gr —tejashwi Yadav (@yadavtejashwi) November 15, 2018 Tejashwi said in the first tweet that there are roads on three sides of the Chief Minister's residence while his government house is on the east side
 tejasvi ne kaha ki nitish kumaar ne baaki teen taraf sisitivi camere lagane kii jarurat nahin samajhi, magar unke ghar ke taraf ek ooncha sisitivi camera laga diya he taaki vah apane virdohi par najar rakh saken
 Tejashwi Yadav also asked the question that when there is a permanent check post for security in the east direction of the Chief Minister's residence then what is the need to install CCTV cameras at the same place? In the tweet, Tejashwi Yadav said that CCTV on Nitish Kumar's opponents This simple act of monitoring through is not going to work
 tejasvi ne kaha ki bihar ke mukhyamantri ko pehle se hi jed plus suraksha mili hui he or vah chahen to or suraksha apane liye le sakate hai, magar oonchai par sisitivi camere lagaana unki niztaa kaa ulanghan he
 Tejashwi said that criminal incidents are increasing in the whole of Bihar including Patna and in such a situation the Chief Minister is busy only in spying on the opponents and violating their privacy
 unhone kaha ki janata kii suraksha kaa unhen jaraa bhi khyaal nahin he
 The ongoing tussle with the Lieutenant Governor and officials in Delhi is increasing the tension of the Aam Aadmi Party government

 tourism, ajukeshan, finance, land-building, visilence, services, vimen and child or art-culture ke alaava tamaam wo vibhaag jinaki jimmedaari kisi mantri ko nahin di gayi he
 Recently, Manish Sisodia had expressed his displeasure at the removal of consultants
 unhen hataae jane vaale 9 salaahkaaron main zyaadaatar manish sisodiya ke vibhaag se hi jude hue the
 Expressing his objection, Sisodia wrote a letter to the Prime Minister praising Atishi Marlena and fiercely targeted her
 isse pehle bhi kai maukon par manish sisodiya sidhe uparajyapal se takkar lete najar aa chuke hai
 Best wishes

 khandudi sarkaar ne bhrashtachar se ladane ke liye janalokapal bill ko jas kaa tas paarit kar itihaas rachaa tha, lekin nizaam congress ke haath aate hi yah aitihaasik kavayad sachmuch 'itihaas' banane kii ore agrasar he
 Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna is in favor of making amendments to exclude lower courts from its purview, prohibiting this
 lekin purv mukhyamantri khandudi kanoon main kisi bhi badlaav ko chunauti dete hai
 Speaking to India Today, he said, "is the government assuming that corruption cannot be done in lower courts
 hamane is kanoon kii paridhi main mukhyamantri se lekar aisi sabhi sansthaaon ko shaamil kiya tha jinhen rajya sarkaar fund muhaiyaa karaati he or jahaan bhrashtachar kii ashanka he
 In September last year, the BJP high command handed over Ramesh Pokhriyal 'nishank' to Khanduri as chief minister amid alleged allegations of corruption in Uttarakhand
 jiske baad unhone bina kisi deree ke pehali november ko vidhansabha se anna hajaare ke janalokapal bill kaa samarthan kiya or bhrashtachar virdohi bayaar kaa laabh uthaaya
 Instead of merely advising the Lokayukta in the state, it also created a strong Lokpal by giving powers to investigate complaints, litigate and punish
 chunaavon se thik pehle rajya main saakh ke liye sangharsh kar rahi bhaajapa ne chunaav main sammanjanak 31 siten hasil kin, jo congress se mahaj ek seat kam he
 Many believe that one of the reasons for this improved performance of BJP was the Lokpal Bill
 agar khandudi chunaav nahin haarate, to parrty kii satta main vaapasi hoti
 But the Congress which came to power is now bent on erasing this identity of Khanduri
 purv sansadeey kaarymantri prakaash pant kehete hai, ''agar is kanoon se koi bhi chhedchhad kii gai, to iskaa matlab hoga ki sarkaar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf khadi nahin ho sakati
 However, when the bill was passed, the Congress did not risk in the wind of Anna's agitation and the Governor too immediately agreed and sent it to the President
 yah bill philhal raashtrapati ke paas lambit he or bahuguna isi ko aadhaar banaakar sanshodhan kii koshish main hai
 However, they will wait for the Lokayukta bill to be passed by Parliament before the amendment
 lekin mana ja rahaa he ki bahuguna sarkaar mukhyamantri or nichali adaalaton ko isaki paridhi se baahar rakhegi
 Yashpal Arya, state Congress president and Revenue Cooperative Minister in Bahuguna government, says, "when this bill came, the situation was different
" ise buddhijiviyon, vidhi ayog, se salaah liye bina jaldbaaji main laayaa gaya tha
 "they call a change in the law necessary," the previous government has violated Article 251 of the Constitution
 yah kaise nyaaysangat ho saktaa he ki ek hi sanstha (lokayukta) ko nyaaypalika or police donon kii shaktiyaan de di jaaen
 "but Khanduri says," When we explained the provisions of the Constitution, the Congress allowed the bill to be passed without any protest
 '' ve aage kehete hai, ''samvidhan se upar koi nahin he
 We have included only the institutions associated with the state, which are funded by the state government
 sarkaar bataae ki hamane kahaan galati kii he yaa ve kyon kanoon ko badalanaa chaahate hai?''congress sarkaar kii is muhim par team anna kii ore se arvind kejariwal bhi sawaal uthaate hai, ''yah durbhagyapurna kadam he
 What kind of politics is it that at the time of elections, the Congress talks about the support of the bill in the manifesto and passes the bill unanimously in the assembly, but is going to end it as soon as it comes to power? Heat has started increasing

 China has rejected Home Minister Rajnath Singh's hope of an early solution to the Doklam standoff saying that India must unconditionally withdraw its troops
 gauratlab he ki ek din pehle hi grih mantri rajnath singh ne yah ummid jataai thi ki china is masale ko hal karne ke liye kuch 'sakaaratmak kadam' uthayega
 On Monday, Rajnath Singh said that the Doklam standoff will soon find a solution and India has never attacked any country nor has any expansionary nature
 rajnath singh ne ummid jaahir kii thi ki is gatirodh ko dur karne ke liye china kuch sakaaratmak kadam uthayega
 But on Tuesday, China has again resorted to propaganda, defying this expectation of the Indian Home Minister
 china ne aarope lagaaya he ki bhartiya sena ne 'avaidh tareeke se seemaa paar kiya he
 "chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying said," India has made ridiculous arguments to stop Chinese road construction activities in Doklam
 isliye is samasya ko dur karne ke liye bas ek purv shart he ki bharat apane sainik or sajo-saamaan bina shart hataae
 'it is worth mentioning that in Doklam near Sikkim border sector, India and Chinese army have been face to face for more than two months
 yah gatirodh tab shuru hua jab is ilaake main chini sena dwaara kiye jane vaale sadak nirmaan kaary ko bhartiya sainikon ne roak diya
 India's concern is that if China manages to build a road in Doklam, it will be easier for it to stop accessing the rest of India to the northeast
 doklam ilaake ko bhutan apana maanata he, lekin china kaa daawa he ki yah uske kshetra main aata he

 In this episode, the new channel Drama Pictures has shared a short film - An Arranged in youtube
 film manoranjan dene ke saath-saath vartmaan main shaadiyon ko lekar jis tarah kii asthirataa yuvaaon ke man main hoti he use saamne laati he
 In this film, you will get a wonderful story of a rejected arranged marriage turning into a love marriage in no time
 sabase mjedaar baat ye he ki aapako film dekhte hi tanu vaids manu ke cast tanu or manu donon hi yaad aa jaaenge
 It is also important to be told about this film here because this film entertains in a low budget with the help of limited character and only background score
 ye kahani us arenjd marij se nikalati he jahaan ek samay aisa lagata he ki ye shaadi aakhir kis majaburi se kii ja rahi he
 But its climax binds the two opposing characters in love
 shaadi ke thik pehle ye film kahin bich se shuru hoti he jahaan duulhaa, dulhan se milane sirf isiilie aata he taaki dulhan kii sahmati ke bare main jaan sake
 But Dulhan (tanya Singh) talks of running away, denying the marriage far and wide
 itnaa hi nahin duulhaa bhi dulhan ke saath bhaag jane ke liye raji hota he lekin saath main nahin alag-alag raste tay karne ke liye
 Meanwhile, whatever happens in the script written by Rahul Bhatnagar, everything from dialogue to acting serves you entertainment
 lekin, ye do ek-duusare se bilkul alag kirdaar aapas main shaadi ke liye kaise raji hote hai
 To know this, you have to watch the film
 baat karen kirdaar kii to do logon kii baatcheet main hi puri kahani he
 All the characters who come in the middle only fulfill the demand of the scene
 tanya singh apane kirdaar main bilkul dubi hui najar aa rahi hai
 Sound is the most important part of this short film
 purv koyala sachiv pi
 C
 paarekh or pramukh udyogpati kumaar mangalam birla jabase sibiai ke nishane par aae hai, uske baad se aarope-pratyarope kaa daur jari he
 P
 si
 Parekh has stated that “this decision was approved by the Prime Minister
 
 
 antim faisla unka hi he
 "underlining that the recommendation in a particular case and then the Prime Minister's decision on it, Parekh really wanted to know why only he was being targeted
" Why should the Prime Minister, who was then the Minister of Coal, be discharged? It would not be right to make any decisive remarks because of the investigation under the supervision of the court in this case, but the kind of questions that Parekh has raised, one of them Even a man of common understanding cannot remain silent
 paarekh kaa ravaiya behad ahmiyat rakhata he kyonki unki chhavi hameshaa saaf rahi he or ve ek sakasham or eemaandaar afasar ke rup main jane jate rahe hai
 He was the one who questioned the non-transparent policy of first come first served in the allocation of coal blocks under the Mines and Minerals (development and Regulation) Act at that time and in spite of all the hurdles, more transparent about the selection of private developers
 She strongly advocated the adoption of the auction process
 paarekh kii pehali daleel yah he ki un par lagaae gaye aarope niraadhaar hai kyonki jo sifarish unhone pradhanmantri se kii or jis par pradhanmantri ne faisla liya, vah sirf or sirf yogyata or gunvattta par aadhaarit thi
 Still, if they are accused of conspiracy, should not the Prime Minister be accused of giving such a charge? Parekh's argument has weight
 janata ko asal main yah baat pareshaan kar rahi he ki bhrashtachar ke maamalon main beyimaan rajanetaaon ko to turant ‘clin chit’ mil ja rahi he, jabaki isamen shaamil chote pyaadon ko lagaataar pareshaan kiya ja rahaa he
 The deal related to his ministry at a minister's own house is fresh in everyone's mind
 us mantri ko haal hi main jaanch agency ne jhatpat ‘clin chit’ de di or baakiyon ko berahami se bali kaa bakra bana diya gaya
 Two senior politicians, whose public image has not been very clean at all, were declared 'innocent' at a time when the ruling party was probably desperate for a political alliance with them
 hamaare paas agar sabase nishpaksh jaanch agency he, to aise main is tarah kii ghatnaayen janata kii najar main uski saakh ko batta lagaati hai
 The first concern that arises in the case of Parekh is that there is no difference in the decisions taken "with honesty and with malfeasance"
 hamaari visilence agenciyon ke paas aisa koi tantra nahin jiske aadhaar par ve sarkari afasaron kaa trek record dekhakar unki reating kar saken or eemaandaar afasaron ko unke faislon ke liye oche aaropon se bachaa saken
 The charges being levied against honest officers will surely damage the governance and will also make the path of steps taken with good intentions
 hamaare desh ke niyam-kanoon bade jatil hai or mumkin he ki alag-alag afasar unka alag-alag arth nikaal len
 No investigative agency should question his interpretation and link him to criminal conspiracy
 aise maamalon main adhikariyon ko bhrasht tehraane kii bajaae ek peshewar jaanch agency ko chahie ki vah niyam-kanoonon kii jatiltaaon kii ore dhyaan de or unhen aasaan banane ke suzav pesh kare
 In this regard, nothing has been done yet on the suggestions made earlier to the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC)
 paarekh maamle ne na sirf faislon par muhar lagane ke maamle main pradhanmantri karyaalay (piemo) kii dabadabe vaali bhoomika kii ore dhyaan khinchaa, balki sambhavit taur par iske ulate asar kii ore bhi ishaara kiya
 The PMO interferes in almost all important matters and functioning of various ministries and influences decisions
 inke peeche kai baar korporate gharaanon kaa bhi dabaav hota he
 In June last year, i requested the Central Vigilance Commission to investigate the role of the PMO in the coal scam and some other scams
 koi pratikriya na milane par maine unhen do baar yaad dilaayaa, lekin kahaan asar hone vaala tha
 Separate for the PMO and ministers and separate for the rest, no inquiry should have such double scales
 is maamle ne ek or mudde ko saamne kar diya he
 That is the freedom of the CBI to function independently
 surpim court ne sibiai ko ‘pinjre main band tota’ kaha tha or sarkaar ko salaah di thi ki is agency ko itnaa shashakt banaae ki yah kisi ke bhi dabaav main aae bagaiyr kaam kar sake
 According to press reports, the Center has told the Supreme Court that the CBI needs only limited autonomy
 sarkaar sibiai par apni pakad dhili karne se kyon jhijak rahi he, isaki vajah to sirf vahi jaanati he
 Empowering CBI without empowering it with professional capabilities is not going to yield the desired results
 koyala ghotaale par chal rahi jaanch prakriya ne koyala utpaadan jaise bade mudde ko haashie par daalkar bhrashtachar ke saath ise gadmad kar diya he
 This process often revolves around details that have no power
 samay aa gaya he ki ham koyala ghotaale se upji dhundh ko hataakar sarthak muddon par dhyaan den

 Seeking to provide infrastructure to Bihar at a ratio of population to Bihar from the center, Singh said that out of the 44 central universities in the country, there are four central universities in the neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh while there is not one in Bihar
 unhone kaha ki bihar kii vartmaan aabaadi kareeb das karod he jo ki desh kii kul aabaadi kaa das pratishat he or us hisaab se yahaan teen se adhik kendriya vishvavidhyalay hona chahie
 Singh demanded that an honorary university be opened in Vaishali, seeking to better develop Patna University, one of the seven oldest universities in the country
 singh vaishali se saansad hai
 Talking about the health situation in Bihar not improving, Singh demanded the opening of five AIIMS branches here and claimed that 60 per cent of the patients from Delhi are from AIIMS in Delhi
 unhone centre se bihar ke mujffarpur, bhagalpur, gaya, darbhanga sthit aspataalon ko or adhik vikisit kiye jane ke saath ames ke tarj par patna sthit indira gandhi ayurvigyaan santhaan ko viksit kiye jane kii maang kii
 RJD vice-president Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said that there is a shortage of doctors in the state, claiming that a doctor is available in Bihar with a population of one lakh, while in the country a doctor is available for a population of nine thousand
 unhone kaha ki desh main rashtriya rajmarg kii kul lambaai 71 hajaar kilometre he jabaki bihar ko apane chah hajaar rashtriya rajmarg ke aavashyakta kii purti ke liye 3700 kilometre sadak kii or aavashyakta he,singh ne kaha ki bihar main aavashyakta anuroop rashtriya rajmarg ban jane par anya pathon par yatayaat kaa bhaar kam hoga or usase aarthik gatividhiyon main teji aegi
 On all these issues, under the leadership of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, his party will soon launch an agitation in the entire state

 Pankaj Batra, chairman of the Central Electricity Authority, says, "the government has set a target of providing electricity to every household under the Saubhagya scheme but the power distribution companies of the states are at a loss because they are unable to buy expensive electricity
 maan lijie, company exange se 5 yaa 6 rupee prati unit bijli kharidti he
 After that, it becomes quite expensive by including distribution and transmission expenses, after which it is no longer viable for the company

 lekin gharon tak bijli na pahunch paane kaa bada kaaran jarjar avasthaa main mila buniyadi dhaancha he
 He says, "the availability of electricity causes the transformer to be overloaded due to overloading and even when there is no electricity, we are not able to reach it

 udai kaa kya hua?rajyon ke discom ko ghate se ubaarane ke liye cabinet ne 5 november 2015 ko udai skim ko manjuuri di thi

 pehla, discom ke ghate ko rajyon ke khate main hastantarit kar diya gaya, jisase discom ko byaaj main jane vaali badi raashi kii adaayagi se raahat mil sake
 Second, operational improvements in states, reduction in cost of electricity generation, development of renewable energy, etc
, so as to make DISCOM profitable

 Along with the reduction in the losses incurred every year, the transmission and distribution losses of discoms also reduced by 5 per cent

 Most states have missed the target set in FY 2018
 centre sarkaar ne vitt varsh 2019 ke ant tak kul ghate ko 15 fisadi par laane kaa lakshya rakhaa tha, jise hasil karnaa behad chunauteepurn hoga
 The first Chairman and Power Expert of Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC )
 el
 Rao says that the UDAY scheme brought immediate relief to the power companies but it cannot be considered a permanent solution to the problem
 discom ko aarthik rup se majboot banane ke liye kadam uthaane honge
 Rao says, "if electricity will be given for free, electricity rates will not go up due to elections, infrastructure will not be spent to prevent power theft, then the discoms will revert to the old condition and end the purpose of bringing rise Will be done
 ''sudhaar kii darkaarhar ghar main bijli pahunche iske liye rajya ke discom ke khaaton main paisa hona jaruri he
 Power distribution companies will be able to spend on infrastructure (sub-stations, transformers) only after recovering from the losses and will ensure that there is no shortage of power in the state by paying money to the power generation companies
 bijli vitaran companiyon ko aarthik rup se sampann banane ke liye rajya sarkaron ko rajnatik phaayde ke liye sasti or muft bijli baantne par ankush lagaana hoga
 The infrastructure has to be repaired to prevent power theft
 iske saath hi sarkari ekadhikaar vaale kshetron (koyala, railway, bijli vitaran) ko prabhavi banane kii jarurat he
 According to CERC data, in the last seven years (from 2009-10 to 2016-17), coal prices rose by 33 per cent, taxes and duties increased by 207 per cent, while coal transportation was up by 54 per cent
 ye sabhi ve kshetra hai jahaan sarkari ekadhikaar he
 In addition, transmission and distribution costs have increased
 in kshetron ko prabhavi banaakar bijli kii dar ko kam kiya ja saktaa he
 Private companies producing electricity in the country are troubled by double whammy
 pehla, rajya kii bijli vitaran companiyon par bakaayaa or doosraa, jarurat ke mutabik koyala na mil paanaa
 Ashok Khurana, director-general of the Association of Power Producers, says that private power companies have about Rs 22,000 crore on state discoms
 bakaayaa he
 Apart from this, the condition of coal supply is also bad
 khurana kehete hai ki jarurat kaa 75 fisadi koyala hi nijee power plant ko mil paata he
 Out of this 75 percent, only 30 percent is being supplied to some plants
 khurana yah bhi kehete hai ki tarriff main badhotaree karke upabhokta par boj daalane kaa koi vikalp nahin he
 In the last seven years, the cost of electricity production has gone up by more than 31 percent
 aise main keval tarriff badhaakar isaki bharpai nahin kii ja sakati he
 For this, steps need to be taken to make government monopoly areas effective
 masalan, koyale kaa utpaadan, power plant tak koyala le jane ke liye railway par nirbharta or bijli kaa transmishan or distribution
 By improving these areas the cost of electricity generation can be reduced significantly
 koyale kii killatashirsh koyala utpaadak hone ke baad bhi agar desh ke bijli gharon main koyale kii kami he to iskaa jimmedaar aap bhartiya rail ko maan sakate hai
 According to the recently released report by Edelweiss, railway rakes are not available as per the requirement to transport coal to power plants and private power generation companies are not getting preference in it
 sarkari aankadon ke mutabik, prati din koyale kii supplai ke liye 288 rex kii tulana main kol india se 259 rex kii supplai ho paa rahi thi
 The shortage of coal forces the power companies to import expensive, which subsequently leads to an increase in electricity prices on the exchange
 23 july ke aankadon ke mutabik, desh main kul 18 power plant aise hai jo koyale kii kami se jujh rahe hai
 Of these, coal availability at seven power plants is less than seven days
 vahiin 11 plant par koyale kii uplabdhta chaar din se bhi kam he
 Batra says, "in the coming days, the shortage of coal will appear to be decreasing
 pichley saal barish jaldi band ho jane ke kaaran hydro power kaa utpaadan kam hua or koyale kii maang achaanak bad gai
 "humidity causes people to use air condition more, due to which the demand for electricity increases
 maujuuda sarkaar main koyala or railway mantralay ko ek mantri (piyush goyal) ke jimme dene ke peeche sarkaar kii koshish in vibhaagon ke beeche behatar samanvay sthapit karne kii thi
 But due to the lack of repair and renovation of the rail track, not only passenger trains but also freight trains have been made late
 vahiin es
 L
 raav kehete hai, "koyale kii desh koi kami nahin he
 But reliance on railways to deliver coal from mines to power plants is the biggest reason for not getting coal as per requirement
 ''yahi kaaran he ki un bijli gharon main koyale kii zyada killat he jo khadaanon se dur hai
 For example, for the power plant near Mumbai, it takes less time to import coal from Australia than it takes to get coal from the country
 kisi bhi power plant ke liye koyala aayaat karnaa behatar vikalp nahin he lekin killat se jujhate plant ke liye aayaat hi vikalp bachataa he
 You will get the privilege of getting electricity in every house only when you see electricity as well as services like telecom, road, airlines etc

 It is necessary that the financial position of the distribution companies is strengthened
 iske liye hamane "udai'' yojana chalaai, taaki vitaran companiyon ke ghate kam hon
 Do you believe that policies need to be changed in the case of coal railways and transmission etc
? The supply of coal is adequate and on time, it is most important for power generation and the difficulties are due to the lack of availability of coal
 ham koyala or rail mantralay ke saath nirantar sampark karke koyale kii samuchit aapurti aashwast karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 We have made a change in the system to provide power generation companies to use their coal supply flexibly and provide more coal to their plants which are near or more effective near coal mines
 hamane yah bhi vyavastha kii he ki rajya sarkaar apane paas uplabdh kol linkage ke aadhaar par bidkarke power kaa kray kar sakenge or vidyut utpaadan companiya is prakaar ke bid main bhaag lekar kam daam par vidyut aapurti kar sakengi
 As a result, coal will be used more effectively

 bjp's candidate for the post of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to meet India's superstar Rajinikanth at a private meeting at his residence in Chennai today
 bijepi mahasachiv evam tamilnadu prabharee pi muralidhar raav ne soshal netwarking site ‘twitor’ par kaha, ‘narendra modi sine superstar rajnikant se ravivaar ko chennai sthit unke awaas par mulaakaat karenge
 BJP sources said that the party's prime ministerial candidate will go to Chennai to address a public meeting but before that he will go to Rajinikanth's house for a 'private meeting' with him at around 5 pm
 yah puche jane par ki kya is mulaakaat kaa loksabhaa chunaav par koi prabhaav hoga, sutara ne kaha ‘yah ek nijee mulaakaat he’ lekin saath hi yah bhi kaha ki ‘narendra modi or chunaav ko alag nahin kiya ja saktaa
 'BJP leaders had earlier hoped that the party would get some support from Rajinikanth which has wide influence not only in Tamil Nadu but also in other states
 bijepi kaa tamilnadu kii raajnneeti main naam maatr kaa aadhaar rahaa he lekin kai kshetreey dalon se gathbandhan karne ke baad vah is baar achche pradarshan kii ummid kar rahi he
 Significantly, Rajinikanth's fans have been urging him to form a political party
 logon kii deewangi ke baavjood unhone apana dayera filmon tak hi simit rakhaa
 During the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, Rajinikanth announced to vote for the BJP
 lekin vah bijepi yaa kisi anya party se nahin jude
 Despite this, the BJP could not win a single seat in Tamil Nadu
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan bhi bijepi ne rajnikant kaa samarthan praapt karne kii bharpoor koshish kii
 In 2008, senior BJP leader LK Advani also met him but he could not win his heart
 abhi bhi rajnikant bijepi se judane ko lekar anicchhuk najar aa rahe hai
 In such a situation, many political meanings of Modi's friendly meeting with him are being extracted
 pichley maheene jab unase sawaal kiya gaya tha ki aane vaale loksabhaa chunaavon main kya vah bijepi ke piem candidet narendra modi yaa aam aadmi party ke netaa arvind kejariwal kaa samarthan karenge, is par rajnikant ne do took kaha tha, ‘no politics

 Looking at the political history, it has happened after many days when on the basis of morality, so many people resigned or offered to resign at a time when the election results were not arbitrary

 janakpur-ayodhya bus service with Oli flagged off
 is bas sarvice ko ramayana circuit ke vistaar ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 Let us tell you that about 493 km between Ayodhya to Janakpur
 kii duuri he
 Modi said- i am the first PM to worship here
 With the commencement of this bus service, large number of devotees will be able to visit
 iske alaava dilli se ayodhya pahunchakar nepal ke janakapur jane ke liye sidhi bas le sakenge log
 People will get ease in movement of India from Madhesi areas
 janaki mandir main puja karne ke baad pradhanmantri ne kaha ki mujhe garv he ki yahaan aakar mata sita kii puja karne kaa saubhaahgya mila
 i am the first Prime Minister of India who came and worshiped in Janakpur
 main nepal ke pradhanmantri kaa shukriya karnaa chahta hum
 He said that tourism is moving fast in the whole world
 ham donon desh milakar ramayana circuit kii yojana ko aage badha rahe hai
 He said that it is a pleasure for me that the bus service of Janakpur is being started from Ayodhya, UP, which made me Prime Minister
 kyon khaas he janakapur?nepal ke janakapur ke kendra main sthit janaki mandir devi sita ko samarpit he
 This temple is also called Janakpurdham
 hindu dharm main aasthaa rakhane vaale log is mandir ke vishaal parisar ko dekhakar dang rah jate hai
 This temple was built in 1911 by Rani of Tikamgarh, Madhya Pradesh
 iske nirmaan main takreeban 16 saal lage the
 There are a total of 115 ponds around the huge complex of the temple
 iske alaava kai kund bhi hai, jinamein gangasagar, parashuram kund evam dhanush-sagar adhik prasiddh hai
 It is worth noting that the Ramayana Circuit is one of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's dream project in which Janakpur is an important stop
 ramayana circuit yojana ke pehle charan ke liye kendra sarkaar ne 245 karod kaa bajet prastaavit kiya he
 Apart from this, a separate budget is also proposed for 11 sites between Chitrakoot and Shringverpur

 Like the students living in university hostels, many ministers of Modi government are seen wearing 'namo Hoodie'
 50 kii umr main shahrukh khan bhi is tarah kii hudi pahante hai taaki yuva or urjavan dikhen
 Even before the arrival of this hoodie, the media has created the image of some ministers as energetic and working
 unamem se ek hai rail mantri piyush goyal
 If you go to the tweeter handle of Piyush Goyal, then you will know that every morning, the Minister makes a tweet on the birth anniversary or death anniversary of some great man, remembers him and tells his inspiration
 magar itane mahapurushon kii prerana paakar bhi ve apane mantralay kii yojanaon main theke par kaam kar rahe mazaduron ko shoshan se nahin bachaa sakate hai
 Against the image created in the media, if you look at the CAG report on the contract laborers, then you will know that the railway is running without a minister
 ram bharose kahana thik nahin hoga kyonki ram bharose to sara desh chalata he
 If the Minister objected to the CAG report, he should take this report and read it among the ten and twenty thousand contract workers
 doodh kaa doodh pani kaa pani ho jayega
 The CAG has reviewed the status of contract workers working in 463 contracts awarded between 2014-15 and 2016-17
 is audit ko padhakar lagata he ki railway main 2014 ke baad kuch bhi nahin badla he
 Contractor fun is still on
 railway ne 2016-17 main theke par kaam karaane ke liye 35098 karod kaa bhugtan kiya tha
 The CAG says that the contractors killed 4 percent of the amount, ie, more than Rs 1400 crore from the workers' share
 yahi nahin rail mantralay kai hazaar karod rupee ke kantrect detii he
 In order to protect the workers hired in those works from exploitation, none of the laws Parliament has enacted, even 50 percent have to be followed
 na to unhen nunatam mazaduri milti he, na over time miltaa he, na chuttee milti he, na chuttee kaa paisa miltaa he, na unka providend fund katataa he or na hi unka bhavishya nidhi karmchaaree sanghathan main panjikaran he
 According to the CAG report, according to the rules, no officer or representative from the railway goes to investigate these contracts
 railway hi nahin, shram mantralay, bhavishya nidhi sanghathan kii taraf se bhi koi jaanch karne nahin jaataa he
 Contractors have an open leeway to rob
 bina license ke theke de die jate hai
 The CAG found that only 140 contractors have registered themselves in the Central Labor Commissioner's office
 usamen se bhi sirf 12 thekedaaron ne apana salanaa lekha-jokha diya he
 While it is mandatory for all the contractors to calculate
 railway ke paas apane sabhi thekedaaron ke ricard hone chahie
 When asked by the CAG, the records of only 30 contractors were found
 aap sochie jab bhartiya rail main tees chalis hazaar karod kii pariyojna main thekedaar bina hisaab-kitaab ke kaam kar rahe hai to lut kii raashi kaa paimaana kya hoga?sainkadon kii sankhya main thekedaaron ne sieji ko ricard hi nahin die
 The CAG wanted to see how many workers were getting checks or payments from the bank
 niyam yahi he ki bhugtan bank yaa check se hoga
 In 212 contracts, there was no record of how the money was given
 maatr 18 kantrect main vetan kii parchi kati mili
 In 169 contracts, payment was made in cash whereas this government is said to be against cash payment
 use bhrashtachar kaa zariyaa maanati he lekin rail mantri apane hi mantralay ke kantrect main nagad bhugtan sunishchit nahin kar sake
 It is obvious that the contractors are being looted heavily in the railway
 nunatam mazaduri milane kaa kanoon he lekin 463 thekon main se maatr 105 main hi nunatam mazaduri di gai he
 Many did not even give records
 kisi bhi project kii laagat tay karte vakt nunatam mazaduri ke hisaab se laagat tay hoti he
 If the contractor kills that money, then how many hundred crores would be accounted for in his pocket
 janata ke paise se sarkaar ne thekedaaron ko diya ki aap puraa paisa do magar thekedaaron ne mazaduron ko puraa paisa nahin diya
 Public money was looted from both sides
 maatr 120 kantrect main chuttee mili or chuttee ke paise die gaye
 Not in the rest
 sieji ne likhaa he ki 2745 mazaduron ke 5
 46 crore rupees were killed by the contractors
 49 thekon main na to chuttee mili or na hi chuttee kaa paisa
 Overtime is required to be done for more than 9 hours or more than 48 hours in a week
 30 kantrect main paaya gaya ki over time nahi diya gaya or 1
 74 crore rupees were killed
 sieji kii report bataati he ki rail mantralay ke bheetar kuch khaas nahin badla he
 Contractor fun is still on
 rail mantri agar kaam karte, in sab baton ko thik karte to railway ke lakhon mazdoor khush hote
 They would have been talking
 unka shoshan nahin hota or rail mantri ko twitor par din bhar apana prachaar nahin karnaa padataa
