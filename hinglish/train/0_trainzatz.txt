 shaayad hi isse pehle aisa betuka farmaan kisi ne jari kiya ho
 Eccentric dictator Kim Jong is going to officially crown himself as North Korea's nation president on May 6
 is tajposhi samaaroh ke dauraan koi aadchan na aae, bas isliye usne ek hukum jari kar diya
 The order is that there will be no marriage, no funeral or mourning in North Korea's capital Pyongyang for a week
 bas hogi to sirf sanakee sultan kii tajoshi kii khushiyaan
 Yes, this is the order of the eccentric Sultan whose tales of whims are currently being heard and narrated throughout the world
 uttar korea ke taanashaah kim jong un kii ye sabase tazaa sanak he
 This decree clearly means that one week neither one can celebrate happiness according to his own nor mourning
 chaar saal pehle hi usne uttar korea kii gaddi sambhaal lee thi
 In the last four years, he has also established his position as the supreme leader of North Korea
 magar ab aadhikarik taur par wo khud kii tajposhi karnaa chahta he
 The coronation program is being held after 36 years, as the ruling Workers Party of Korea of north Korea has called a conference in the capital Pyongyang on 6 May
 aisa sammelan 36 saal baad ho rahaa he
 Earlier in 1980, such a big ceremony was held to crown Kim Jong Un's father
 chah may ke samaaroh main uttar korea ke shaasha ke taur par kim jong un kii aadhikarik tajposhi hogi
 Thousands of delegates are scheduled to arrive in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, to attend the coronation ceremony
 taale main band rahenge logtajposhi samaaroh main koi gadabadi na ho bas isliye kim jong un ne puri rajdhani kii suraksha itani kadi kar dene kaa hukum suna diya ki ek hafte tak aam aadmi sadak par to kya gharon main bhi lagbhag kaid hokar rahegaa
 Every house in the capital is being searched and everyone has been ordered to lock their homes at a particular time
 jin jagahon ko lekar jaraa bhi shaq hua vahaan pehle hi sena ne taala laga diya he
 There will be no marriage, no funeral, nor there will be any disturbance during the mourning ceremony
 Therefore, all marriages and funerals in the capital have been banned till May 6
 shaadi kii taarikh to phir bhi logon ne aage khiskaa di magar dikkat unke saath he jinke gharon main maut ho gai
 Now neither can he perform his last rites till May 6, nor can he cry full because mourning is forbidden during the coronation
 shaq hone par pehle hi jail main bhar die logakhabaron ke mutabik tajposhi ke dauraan kim jong un uttar korea ko parmaanu las raashtra ghoshit karne ja rahaa he
 For this, there should not be any obstacle in this coronation, for this, he has already taken all those people hostage and put him in jail, which he had a little doubt about
 saikadon log ko maut, lakhon bandhak2011 main satta sanbhaalane ke baad se kim jong un apane raajnneetik virodhiyon or satta ko chunauti dene vaale kareeb 200 se zyada netaaon or afasaron ko maut ke ghat utaar chukaa he
 It is said that about 2 lakh people have been held hostage in camps and different jails in North Korea
 inhen main se ek camp se achaanak tees hajaar bandhak gaayab ho gaye the
 His search continues even today
 saal 2013 main ai maanvadhakir ayog kii ek report ke mutabik kim jong un ke ab tak ke kaarykaal ke dauraan ek lakh 20 hajaar netaaon ko alag-alag jelon main band kar diya gaya he
 People are dying of hunger, there is news that crores of rupees are being spent for the coronation ceremony and on the other hand, one sad truth is that thousands of people of the same North Korea have died due to hunger
 pichley chaar saalon se jab se kim jong un ne gaddi sanbhali he bas bam or bandook hi uskaa shauk rahaa he
 He has made a Hydron bomb but is unable to feed his own people
 alam ye he ki log ghaas kha-kha kar kisi tarah apni saansen chalaa rahe hai
 People forced to eat by killing children: The condition of North Korea is now so terrible that in some areas, there have been reports of people having even killed their own children by eating their food
 asia press ke hawaale se sande times main chhapi is khabar ke mutabik uttar korea main bhukh kii vajah se ek shaks apane hi pote kii laash kha gaya
 Photos of people uprooting grass for their food have also come to light in many cities and towns
 ek andaaje ke mutabik haal ke dinon main sirf bhukh or akaal se hi uttar korea main 10 hajaar log maare gaye hai
 People are dying of starvation due to death by watching porn movies, but they enjoy threatening America
 bam banane main majaa aata he
 Anyone can be surprised to hear stories of Kim Jong Un's insanity
 kya aap yakeen karenge ki uttar korea is daur main bhi ek aisa mulk he jahaan mobile ke istemaal tak par pabandi he? ji haa, yahi sach he
 But this is not just an example of dictatorship in North Korea, but reading the Bible or watching a porn movie here is a direct death sentence
 videshi bhi nahin kar sakate mobile kaa istemalasuchana kranti ke is daur main jab har duusare din koi nai chiz, nayaa gajet duniya kaa aakaar chota kar rahi he, uttar korea ne apane yahaan maboil ke istemaal par hi pabandi laga rakhi he
 Even tourists visiting from abroad are not allowed to bring and use mobile phones with them
 agar koi yahaan mobile lekar aata he, to use surakshakarmi pehle hi apane paas rakh lete hai or vaapasi ke vakt unhen unka mobile phone lautaa diya jaataa he
 Death is found when reading the Bible
 Even here, even a thing like marijuana is not considered to be drugs and freedom to use it, whereas reading the Bible is such a big crime that if caught doing this, one gets death
 yahaan genes pahananaa bhi ek gunaah he or kisi garib kii tasviir utaarna usase bhi bada gunaah kyonki kim jong un maanata he ki garib kii tasviir khinch kar use rakhane yaa kahin baatane se desh kii chhavi kharaab hoti he
 There are houses with only one color
 But what would be a greater proof of dictatorship that no citizen of North Korea can celebrate his birthday on July 8 and December 17 especially because the first ruler of the country, Kim Il-sung, on July 8 The death occurred while Kim Jong Un's father Kim Jong Il died on 17 December
 taanaashaahee kaa ek or subut ye he ki yahaan koi apni marji se apane ghar ko paint bhi nahin karvaa saktaa
 Rather, all people have to paint their house with the gray color set by Kim Jong Un
 rishtedaaron ko shikari kutton ke saamne phinkavayakim jong un ek aisa beraham taanashaah he jo kisi bhi had tak ja saktaa he
 It is said that till now thousands of people have been killed
 uskaa julm uske desh ke log jhelane ko majaboor hai kyonki kim baghawat bardaasht nahin karata
 He strictly suppresses the voice of protest
 isane apane rishtedaaron ko bhi shikari kutton ke aage phinkavaya tha
 Those who sprinkle life on him, his persecution continues
 logon ko jabardastee banaaya jaataa he sainicamerica ne kim ke desh par kai tarah kii paabandiyaan laga rakhi hai
 The US government calls North Korea the Axis of Evils, the axis of Satan, but it has rarely affected Kim Jong-un's health
 dakshin korea or america ke saath lagaataar tanaav ke chalate yahaan hameshaa yuddh jaise halaat bane rahete hai
 Therefore, to increase its military strength, this dictator orders people from every household to forcefully join the army
 itnaa hi nahin, sena kii takat badhaane ke liye ladakiyon ko bhi jabardastee sainik banaata he
 Everything Kim does is that at the age of 32, he got the throne of North Korea and the relatives who made him fit to take the throne first killed his own people
 wo bhi aise-vaise nahin balki top se uda kar yaa phir bhukhe kutton ke aage daal kar
 Under his rule, the common people are not allowed to keep a car or walk in the car
 uske desh main baalo kaa style vahi hota he jo khud uske bal kaa hota he
 The color of the city houses also determines the same
 hydrogen bam ke test se pehle pichley saal april main ye tab surkhiyon main aayaa tha jab isane apane hi raksha mantri ko sirf isliye top se uda diya tha kyonki wo ek meeting ke dauraan so gaye the
 In this, his own uncle was stripped and thrown in front of a hundred hungry dogs because he became a threat to its chair
 iske mulk main agar koi videshi tivi channel, videshi filmein yaa videshi gaanaa sune to use ye faansee par chadha detaa he or uske ghar ko aag ke hawaale kar detaa he
 In this country, ordinary people cannot walk by car
 ye haq sirf mantri or raksha mantralay ke afasaron ko he
 In this country, its hair style is considered the fashion of everyone's hair
 ajibo-garib harakatenkhabaron ke mutabik uttar korea ke sena pramukh hyon yong jol ne sena kii ek meeting main halaki si jhapai le lee thi
 It was for this reason that 66-year-old Heyan was flown with an anti-aircraft gun at a military training range on April 30 in the presence of hundreds of people
 hyaan ko maut kii sajaa unki giraftaar ke teen din baad di gai
 Wonderful from above, Kim blew his last rites with full state honors after blowing his body into pieces
 kim ko apane dada kii tarah dikhne kaa jabardast shauk he
 It is said that he has undergone several cosmetic operations of his face and body, in want of his grandfather's appearance
 isliye wo apane vajan bhi kam nahin karata
 Kim has a great passion for horse riding, but the condition is that at the time when she rides, no one else is seen riding, otherwise he gets her shot

 Kejriwal said that the BJP and Congress hate the Aggarwal society
 jab susheel gupta or endi gupta ke naam kii ghoshnaa kii gai to bijepi or congress ise 2G(2 Gupta) ghotaalaa bataane lagi
 Their problem was that the Aam Aadmi Party gave 2 Gupta tickets to Rajya Sabha

 Kejriwal says that if BJP and Congress find the 2G scam to give Rajya Sabha ticket a 2G scam, then next time both parties do not come to demand money from Agrawal society, then we will see how your party runs

 jadyu ke varisht netaa or purv mantri vijay kumaar choudhary ne bihar vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa kii karaari haar par kaha ki varsh 2005 or 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ke kaaran jadyu ko phayda nahin hua balki nitish kumaar kii lokapriyata or vishwasaneeyata kaa laabh bhaajapa ne uthaaya
 Chaudhary alleged that in this election the BJP announced an agreement with three parties and two parties unannounced but the people of Bihar denied all their 'conspiracies' and 'hawkishness' and Modi's charismatic personality in this election Could not even salvage him
 choudhary ne kaha ki pichley do saalon se jab se jadyu ne bhaajapa se naata todaa, tab se haal main sampann bihar vidhansabha chunaav tak pradhanmantri narendra modi samet bhaajapa ke sabhi prantiy or kendriya netaa yah jataane kii koshish karte rahe hai ki bhaajapa ne hi nitish kumaar ko mukhyamantri banaaya or yah uskaa tyaag tha jo unhen netaa maan liya
 Chaudhary said that it was repeatedly clarified by the JDU that it was Nitish Kumar's popularity and credibility on the basis of which the BJP also benefited and got more than 90 seats (bihar Assembly elections 2010)
 ise maanane ko bhaajapa taiyaar nahin thi
 The comments choudhary ne kaha ki isaki pariksha bihar vidhansabha chunaav 2015 main ho gayi or nitish kumaar apane sarvamaanya or vishwasaneey vyaktitv ke bal par nae sahyogiyon ke saath ek baar phir baari bahumat se sarkaar bana rahe hai
 He said that with the result of Bihar Assembly Election 2015, the BJP would have known what its strength is without Nitish Kumar
 unhone kaha ki is chunaav ke baad bhaajapa ko ahsaas ho gaya hoga ki nitish kumaar unke kaaran mukhyamantri bane the ki bhaajapa kii takat or vidhayakon kii sankhya nitish ke kaaran badi thi
 Chaudhary said that since the last two years when JDU broke with the BJP, till the recently concluded Bihar assembly elections, all the provincial and central leaders of BJP including Prime Minister Narendra Modi have been trying to show that BJP is Nitish Kumar
 Made him the chief minister and it was his sacrifice that made him a leader
 choudhary ne kaha ki jadyu kii ore se baar-baar spasht kiya gaya ki yah nitish kumaar kii lokapriyata or vishwasaneeyata thi jiske aadhaar par bhaajapa ko bhi phayda hua or use 90 se adhik siten (varsh 2010 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaav) main milin
 The BJP was not ready to accept this
 tippaniyan Chaudhary said that its examination was held in Bihar Assembly Elections 2015 and Nitish Kumar is once again forming the government with an overwhelming majority with new allies on the strength of his omnipotent and reliable personality
 unhone kaha ki bihar vidhansabha chunaav 2015 ke parinaam se bhaajapa ko pataa chal gaya hoga ki nitish kumaar ke bagaiyr uski kya takat he
 He said that after this election the BJP must have realized that Nitish Kumar had become the Chief Minister because of him that the strength of BJP and the number of mlas had increased due to Nitish

 guuruuvaar ko phir rail bajet aayega, kuch nai trainon, kuch badale root, ghate-bade kiraye or ghoshnaaon ke saath aakar chalaa bhi jayega par train ke musafiron kii asal museebataan vahiin rah jaaengi
 The railway budget that meets the expectations of the common man should be something in which new facilities may be less, but some improvements will be made
 1
 Do not use the toilet in the train parked on the platform
 ye chetavanee har train ke toilet main likhi hoti he par chalati train main isi suvidha kaprayog karne ke liye bachapan se nat kii hilti rassi par chalane kaa kaushal chahie hota he, railmantri is taraf dhyaan jarur den
 2
 railway ko yatri kiraye se kamai hoti he, maal dhulaai se kamai hoti he par unase kahin zyada kamai saat-saat saal se ek hi train main ulcer ke oparationake naam par chanda maangane waalon or tali bajaakar bhaybheet karne waalon kii hoti he
 If the railways can get some part of their earnings, then passenger fares do not have to be increased
 3
 In general coaches, it is not wrong to occupy a seat with a handkerchief on the seat, nor is it to lose the mugs tied in chains from the restroom, but spitting on the washbasin and putting shoes on the fan is the wrong thing
 ise dandaneey aparaadh ghoshit karne kii jarurat he
 4
 pradhanmantri bullate train kii baat karte hai, par haath aati he patari kii 'bu' or 'let' train, is sabaki hamen aadat pad chuki he bas har let aane vaali train par tikat dete samay hi kitni der hone vaali he chapa ho, to ghar se nikalne kii jaldi to na rahegi
 5
 iske alaava railmantri chahen to ekaadh suvidhaayen or de den jaise har seat ke paas charging point ho, loar berth badalane waalon se raahat mil jaae or sabase khaas siten thodi chaudee ho jaaen, taaki karavat lete ban sake

 Pain in the head, but such a problem occurs to the mother before giving birth
 yani lebar pen yaa yun kahen ki prasav vednaa jaisi pidaa
 As strange as this sounds, Asaram's illness is just as mysterious
 kyonki ye wo beemaari he, jo naa hi thik hoti he
 Nor does it come out openly, while Asaram's Timardars claim that this disease causes a feeling of childbirth in the head
 ab jaahir he jis beemaari kaa asar hi itnaa ajeeb ho, wo beemaari to ulajhaayegi hi
 Asaram's disease has confused the doctors and law experts
 asaram kehete hai ki unhen trinadi shul beemaari he, jabaki doctor kehete hai ki wo durust hai
 Rather, not only are they right, such a disease does not happen
 baba ko biimaar bataane kii koshish main lage unke bhakt jo kuch kehete hai, wo sunakar to achche se acha bhi chakra jaae
 Leave it to others, Asaram's lady Vaidya Neeta (in the picture below) has also reduced the pain of the mother i
e
 childbirth to express Baba's suffering
 asaram ke bete yani narayan sai se jab is beemaari ke bare main poocha gaya, to unhone bhi vahi jataane kii koshish kii ki jail main baba kisi bhayanak takalif se tadap rahe hai
 It is another matter that Asaram's son Narayan Sai had to resort to papers to tell the name of the disease before uttering the pain
 yani ko bina padhe narayan sai apane pita kii us beemaari kaa naam bhi nahin bataa sake, jisaki vajah se asaram pichley 12-14 saalon se lagaataar tadap rahe hai
 Asaram's disease is no less mysterious
 kyonki jo beemaari MRI scan tak main pakad main naa aae, medical science ke maahir doctor bhi jise pahchaanane main dhokhaa kha jaae or vahi beemaari sir main prasav vednaa kaa ahsaas kara de, to is beemaari ko rahasyamayi to kahana hi hoga
 In the name of this disease, Asaram is not only seeking relief from the court, but is also saying that for his treatment, he needs a female doctor in jail every day
 adaalat to is par khayr baad main faisla karegi, lekin abhi to unka ilaaj karne vaale doctor hi asaram kii daleel par yakeen karne ko taiyaar nahin
 Doctors who have studied modern medicine checked Asaram and reports came that Asaram was fit
 jab koi badi beemaari hi nahin he to bada dard kaise hoga
 So what is the point of this pain? To know that Asaram is making an excuse for the disease? To know this, read the letter of September 4, which Asaram, lodged in the Jodhpur jail, wrote to the District and Sessions Court Judge of Jodhpur - Honorable District and Sessions Judge in the District - Jodhpur (rule
 )mananeey,vishyantargat lekh he ki main gat kareeb saadhe 13 varsh se trinadi shul naamak vyaadhi se grasit hum tathaa meraa ilaaj pichley 2-3 varsh se vaidya nitaji dwaara kiya ja rahaa he
 Which mainly treats a part of Panchakarma by Shirodhara, which takes about two hours
 at aapashri se anurodh he ki vaidya nitaji ko meri uparokt beemaari ke ilaaj hetu aagaamee aath dinon tak pratidin unke samyaanukool kendriya karagaar main bulaane kii prarthana par kaarywahi karen
 Santashree Asaram Bapumamla came under the jurisdiction of the court
 adaalat ke aadesh par medical board baitha
 The board consisted of a physician, a neurologist and a urologist
 in teenon doctoron ke board ne jaanch kii to paaya ki apni umr or bhayankar beemaari kii duhai dene vaale asaram to bilkul durust hai
 Meanwhile, the court continued to date Asaram's plea
 pehle 19 sitambar ko sunwaayee hui
 Then on 24 September, but on 24 the court said - next hearing will be on 30 September
 30 sitambar ko hi asaram kii nyaayik hiraasat puri ho rahi he
 This means that Asaram will neither get treatment from his lady physician Neeta nor his food till his next action on Asaram's bail
 asaram kii gambhir beemaari kai bade sawaal khadey kar rahi he-sawaal number 1- yah dard ubharta kab he?sawaal number 2- pichley 24 dinon se ye dard ubhara kyon nahin?sawaal number 3- dawaaon kii aadhunik duniya ne kyon kiya khaarij?in sawaalon ke garbh se ye sawaal ubharta he ki kya asaram kii beemaari koi bada bahaanaa he
 Isn't the issue somewhere that Asaram's old seekers have been pointing at him
 asaram apni beemaari kaa naam trinadi shul bataate hai, jise ayurveda kii bhashaa main anantvaat or angreji main trigeminal neuralgia kehete hai
 Asaram, who is in jail on charges of sexual exploitation of a minor girl, was demanding the same for the woman Vaidya Nita for two hours every day citing the same disease
 badhane vaali hai asaram kii mushkilanjab koi raazdaar munh kholta he, to phir wo hakeekat bhi baahar aa jaati he, jisaki ummid kisi ko nahin hoti
 The same is happening with Asaram
 ab chhindwara ashram ke diarector sharat chand or rasoie prakaash ne police ko jo kuch bataaya he, usase asaram kii mushkilen or badhati najar aa rahi hai
 Asaram and his son Narayan Sai had said that the victim girl was mentally ill, but in a statement to the police, his Chhindwara Gurukul director Sharat Chandra said that the victim had no illness
 wo ladki ashram kii warden shilpi ke sampark main thi or vahi jaanati he ki kya beemaari thi
 It was only after Asaram received instructions from the Ahmedabad ashram that he hired Shilpi aka Sanchita Gupta
 sharatchand ke bayanon kii pushti or isse jude subooton ko ikattha karne ke liye jodhpur police sharatchand ko lekar chhindwara gurukul pahunchi
 On the other hand, Asaram's cook Prakash also revealed during interrogation that Asaram's mobile phone was the same
 peedita ko jodhpur madi kutiyaa main laane ke liye shilpi, sharat chandra or shiva kaa phone aayaa tha
 Asaram himself knew in advance that the victim was coming to Madai Kutia and arrangements were made for this
 asaram kisi ladki yaa mahila ko choote the to koi virodh nahin karata tha
 Rather, all the girls used to come for dedication
 khabar he ki police sharathchandra or prakaash ko sarkari gavaah bana sakati he
 But meanwhile, the search for mastermind Shilpi continues
 uttar pradesh ke hamirpur main avaidh khanan ke maamle main 4 logon ko notice bhejne ke baad ab pravartan nideshaalay shamali jile main mani londring act ke tahat mukadmaa darj karne ja rahi he
 According to the information, the ED has gathered all the documents and evidence related to the case
 is maamle main purv khanan mantri gayatri prajapati sidhe taur par fanse hue hai, kyonki shamali ke maamle main sibiai dwaara darj exiaar main gayatri prajapati ke kareebi amrendra singh urf pintu or vikaas verma bhi namjad hai
 All people are suspected to have indulged in illegal mining during the SP government on Gayatri Prajapati's strength
 sindicket kii puri tarah se dekhbhaal yahi log karte the or aarope he ki avaidh khanan se ugaahi gai karodon kii sampatti or nagdi apane aakaaon tak hi log pahunchaate the
 Before Gayatri Prajapati was arrested, these two people had planned to make a big bungalow on the highway in Hamirpur to gift to Gayatri Prajapati, but before that Gayatri Prajapati got stuck in the case of rape and their plans were shelved
 philhal taaja musiibat main gayatri prajapati ko bhi lapeta ja saktaa he kyonki yah saare avaidh khanan us vakt hue jab gayatri prajapati uttar pradesh sarkaar main mantri the
 In this case, ED has also taken all the evidence from the charge sheet filed by CBI
 jaankaree ke mutabik sibiai kii chargeshit ke aadhaar par idi gayatri prajapati ke kareebi samet kul 9 aropiyon par mani landring ke tahat mukadmaa darj karegi
 Earlier in 2017, the CBI had lodged an FIR against Gayatri's close relatives in Delhi
 iske baad chhapemari bhi kii gai thi
 In this FIR, apart from two close associates of Gayatri, the then Shamli officials Aamir Siddiqui, JP Pandey, Satish Kumar, Sandeep Rathi, Mangalsen Verma were named among many others
 apane bajet adhiveshan ke pehle din hi uttar pradesh vidhansabha main jamkar hangaamaa hua
 During the Governor's address, Bahujan Samaj Party mlas cut a lot of ruckus
 had to tab ho gai, jab rashtriya lokdal party ke do vidhayak kisaanon ke bakaayaa bhugtan kii maang ko lekar apane kapade utarkar ardhangn khadey ho gayi
 After the incident that hurt the dignity of the assembly, when the assembly sat again, Congress Legislature Party leader Pradeep Mathur quipped that RLD mlas took their clothes off after being influenced by Salman Khan
 baahar aakar sansadeey kaarymantri ajam khan ne ek kadam aage badhkar ye kah diya ki agar wo neeche ke vastra bhi utaar dete to logon ko unki mardaangi ke bare main kuch pataa chal jaataa
 During the Governor's address, RLD mlas Sudesh Sharma and Virpal Rathi took off their kurtas in anger over the demand of arrears of sugarcane farmers and laborers
 bispi ne jamkar hangaamaa kiya or uske vidhayak wel main aakar naare lagane lage
 Meanwhile, BJP boycotted the Governor's address and walked out of the House
 upi vidhansabha main rajyapal ke abhibhaashan ke dauraan jo kuch hua usase sadan to sharmasaar hua hi, lekin uske baad satta paksh ke netaa ajam khan or congress vidhanmandal dal ke netaa pradeep maathur ne jo bayaan diye, wo or bhi sharmnaak the
 Pradeep Mathur compared the two mlas who took off clothes with Salman Khan
 haalanki baad main unhone sadan ke andar diye is bayaan ko majaak bataaya
 He said that the method adopted by these mlas does not suit the Assembly
 areldi vidhanmandal dal ke upanetaa or modinagar se vidhayak sudesh sharma or chhatrauli bagpat se vidhayak virpal rathi ne monsoon satr ke dauraan sadan ke wel main dharna diya tha or sarkaar se maang kii thi ki wo ganna kisaanon ke bakaayon kaa bhugtan karen or modinagar mil jo band ho gayi he uske mazdooron ko bhi muaavja den
 At that time, he received an assurance from the government
 inhone aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar saifai mahotsav main naach-gane par teen sau karod kharch kar sakati he, magar kisaanon ke dard ko samajhane ko taiyaar nahin he
 RLD MLA Sudesh Sharma said that despite the order of the High Court, farmers owed Rs 200 crore to the Modi sugar mill
 kai baar ye maamla vidhansabha main uthaaya gaya he
 The Speaker, Parliamentary Affairs Minister, Chief Minister had assured about this
 sarkaar kii taraf se sansadeey kaarymantri ajam khan ne kaha ki in vidhayakon ne nanga hokar sarkaar kii garima ko chot pahunchaai he
 Everyone would go bare and find glory: Azam Khan, Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, Azam Khan also said, 'in the House of Clothes incident which took place today, the work on behalf of the legislators was reduced to half
 agar neeche kaa bhi hissaa dekhne ko mil jaataa to unki mardaangi ke bare main kuch pataa chal jaataa
 So whatever he did was a display of incomplete masculinity
 ham to is intjaar main the ki shaayad puri antarrashtriya shobhaa unako mil jaae
 If you had also demonstrated the remaining part
 'udhar, mayawati kii party bispi ne bhi sarkaar ko jamkar kosa
 Legislature party leader Swami Prasad Maurya said that everyone is upset

 Environmental pollution from green firecrackers will be up to 30 per cent; QR code will be able to identify genuine green firecrackers despite the ban in the national capital Delhi and NCR
 diwali main bazaar main green pataakhe uplabdh honge
 These firecrackers will help reduce pollution
 saath hi log diwali bhi dhoomdhaam se manaa paaenge
 The price of these firecrackers will also be kept low
 kendriya swasthya mantri harshavardhan ne kaha ki paryaavaran friendli green pataakhon kii keemat zyada nahin hogi
 We set the parameter for this
 green pataakhon se 30 fisadi se zyada vaayu pradooshan kam hoga
 He said that steps should also be taken to not throw fake green crackers in the market
 kendriya mantri ne kaha ki phek green pataakhon main kuar code hoga, jiske jariye pataa chal jayega ki koun sa green pataakhaa he or koun sa pradooshan zyada failaane vaala pataakhaa he
 Let us tell you that due to firecrackers in many cities of the country including the national capital Delhi, air pollution increases on the occasion of Diwali
 iske chalate logon kaa ghar se baahar nikalnaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 Despite all the efforts of the government and the restrictions of the Supreme Court, there is no success in completely stopping pollution in Delhi
 dilli main diwali ke avasar par vaayu pradooshan kii samasya se nipatane ke liye pichley kai varshon se bahes chal rahi he
 Who prepared green firecrackers? On Saturday, Union Minister Harsh Vardhan said that pollution was discussed at the Indian International Science Festival held in Chennai in 2017 too
 diwali main pataakhon kii vajah se vaayu pradooshan kaaphi bad jaataa he
 So i appealed to the scientists that they can make green crackers and can play an important role in reducing air pollution
 iske baad CSIR or NEERI ke vaigyanikon ne green pataakhe taiyaar kiye hai
 Union Minister Harshvardhan said that fireworks like pomegranate, pencil, chakri and phuljhadi are ready to sell in the market
 inamen kuar code lagaaya gaya he, jisase pataa chal jayega ki pataakhaa phek he yaa original he
 230 mous and 165 agreements have been signed to make green firecrackers
 elactoral bond se jahaan agyaat sroton ke hawaale se aane vaale raajnneetik chande ke jari rahane par chunaav ayog ne chintaa jataai he, vahiin FCRA act main badlaav se logon main yah chintaa badi he ki videshi companiyaan bhartiya chunaavon main dakhal de sakati hai
 Experts believe that several amendments to the Foreign Contribution (regulation) Act (FCRA) have made it easier for political parties to receive donations from foreign sources
 FCRA act saal 1976 main bana tha
 In fact it was intended to protect political parties from foreign influence
 baad main FCRA 2010 ke dwaara ise or spasht kiya gaya
 Section 4 of the FCRA Act 1976 and Section 3 of the FCRA 2010 states, 'no political party or its official can accept any help from abroad
 ' epasiare ke kisi bhi praavdhaan kaa ulanghan karne par paanch saal kii jail or yaa jurmaana ho saktaa he
 According to Section 29B of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, political parties cannot take funds from any foreign source or government companies
 bijepi or congress par ho karrwaidanchhsha 2010 or 1976 ke mutabik kisi bhi aisi company ko videshi company mana jaataa he jisamen 50 fisadi se zyada sharholding videshi ho
 The Delhi High Court was challenged and received notice by the BJP and Congress for allegedly taking donations from foreign sources and companies
 saal 2014 main dilli hoicourt ne yah mana ki donon partiyon ne epasiare or arapy act kaa ulanghan kiya he or centre sarkaar se kaha ki chah maah ke bheetar inke khilaaf dandatmak karrwai kii jaae
 But instead of taking action, the central government amended the FCRA 2010 by the Finance Bill 2016, making such violations valid only and secondly, it was extended to the FCRA Act 1976, i
e
 it was accepted as applicable from 1976
 
 NGO par sakhti videshi chande par narmi!is badlaav kaa matlab yah hua ki yadi kisi bhartiya company main videshi sharholding videshi nivesh ke femaa or anya niyamon ke dwaara nirdhaarit seemaa ke bheetar he to company ke dwaara chande ko videshi strot nahin mana jayega
 Even if it has more than 50 percent foreign investment
 iskaa matlab yah he ki videshi companiyaan raajnneetik dalon ko chanda dena jari rakh sakati hai
 On the other hand, the central government has taken strict measures against the foreign funding of Greenpeace India ngos and in the past years FCR licenses of thousands of ngos have been canceled
 november, 2018 main apane ritairement se pehle tatkaaleen mukhya chunaav ayukta opi ravat ne kaha tha, 'chunaav ayog kaa yah maananaa he ki chunaavon kisi bhi tarah se videshi funding kii ijaajat nahin di ja sakati
 'but what steps the Election Commission took to stop this is not known
 philhal supreme court or dilli hoicourt main kam se kam do aisi yachikaayen lambit hai jisamen yah maang kii gai he ki centre sarkaar ko bijepi or congress ke khilaaf karrwai karne ko majaboor kiya jaae, jinhone epasiaar act kaa ulanghan kiya he
 It has also demanded that the change in the Act be withdrawn
 donon bade raajnneetik dalon ne videshi sroton or estisi tathaa mmatisi jaisi sarkari companiyon se chanda liya he or isliye un par epasiare tathaa arapy act ke ulanghan kaa aarope he

 He said that before dying he wants to see her as a government official

 Also, the chairman's bungalow has been accused of harassment by three employees working at different times
 enditivi india ke paas isse jude kai dastauez hai
 From the employees of the railway employing 13 lakh people to the officers, the system has been persecuted and the special thing is that the allegations are being leveled directly against the chairman of the Railway Board, Arunendra Kumar
 fariyadi koi maamuli karmchaaree nahin balki nordan jone main tainaat rahe senior diviginal maikenical ejeeniyar ko−ordination ajay singh hai, jinka aarope he ki unhone railway board ke chairman ke ghar toilet paper nahin bhijwaya or phir baad main unki patni se milane nahin gaye to unhen pareshaan karne ke liye training main bhej diya gaya
 Not only this, another officer was posted on his post
 9 agast ko railway board chairman ke protocol officer sai ne ajay singh ko phone kar kaha ki siarabi sar ke bachche aae hue hai or ghar main toilet paper role khatm ho gaya he bhijwa dijie
 Ajay Singh refused to send the toilet paper roll
 fouran hi chairman railway board kii patni kaa phone aayaa, jisamen unhone sawaal kiya ki aap toilet paper role kyon nahin bhejenge
 On Ajay Singh's refusal once again, crb's wife said that she would talk to the Chief Mechanical Engineer
 phir ajay singh ne apane bos chif maikenical ejeeniyar eke puthiya ko ghatana kii puri jaankaree di
 AK Puthiya asked to finish the matter and send the toilet paper roll to the bungalow, but Ajay Singh again refused
 phir puthiya ne kaha ki vah lakhanu main hai, lautakar somvaar ko baat karenge
 On Monday, Ajay Singh went to meet AK Puthiya at Baroda House
 puthiya sahab ne kaha ki siarabi madam ne tumhaari shikaayat kii he
 You should not have told CRB Madam anyway
 jaao madam se mil lo, lekin ajay singh madam siarabi se milane nahin gaye
 Subsequently, on 26 August, the Divisional Mechanical engineer-ordination Ajay Singh was sent on 5 weeks training and in the meantime, the posting order of SS Ahluwalia on Ajay Singh's post was removed on 12 September
 hairaani kii had he ki jis toilet paper role kii vajah se bavaal machaa vah railway yani sarkari tha, jiskaa ghar yaa nijee istemaal nahin ho saktaa, lekin railway board ke maujuuda chairman khilaaf is tarah kii yah koi pehali shikaayat nahin he
 Rajkumar, who worked at Arunendra Kumar's bungalow in 2010, has complained that Arunendra Kumar and his wife assault him
 madam roj maarthi hai or mujhe yahaan se posting nahin di gai to main pagal ho jaaoongaa
 In 2011, Gokul Singh, who worked as a laborer at Arunendra Kumar's bungalow, also complained to the DRM office about inhuman behavior with him
 gokul ne likhaa ki madam roj sharaab pikar mujhe maarthi hai
 The mother abuses the father and children
 chuttee bhi nahin milti or koi saamaan mangati hai to paise bhi nahin deteen
 In 2013, when Arunendra Kumar was posted as GM in Bilaspur, Kishore Kumar Nayak, who works at his bungalow, also complained of harassment
 nayak ne shikaayat patr main yahaan tak likhaa ki ab to lagane laga he ki bangale main jane kaa matlab maut he, dar he, khoff he
 These are complaints against the Chairman Railway Board and his wife whose documents are with NDTV India, but it is also true that no action has been taken on any such complaint so far
 is mudde par railmantri or rail rajyamantri se bhi baat karne kii koshish kii, lekin railmantri ne jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya or rail rajyamantri ke daftar ne milane kaa vakt hi nahin diya
 The plight of the railway is not something to be heard or told, but a thing to be seen and understood, but the question is that when the free supply of toilet paper is also the responsibility of the Railway Chairman, and if an honest officer refuses to do so If sent on training for torture, then only God will tell when and how the good days of Indian Railways will come despite all the claims of the government

 har din advance hoti mobile technology ne smartfones kii duniya me kranti laa di he
 Smartphones bringing new features are being launched in the market every day
 logon main achche se achche smartfones kharidne kii hode lagi hui he
 The main reason for this is the high quality camera in the smartphone
 smartphone main in dinon front or back camere ke chalate logo me selfi kaa crez badhata ja rahaa he
 It has become so easy to take a picture of yourself with the front camera of the mobile that people do not resort to others to click photos like before
 wo khud hi apane mahange smartphone ke front camere se apni tasveere lenaa zyada pasand karte he
 Which is called selfie
 in dinon yuvaao main selfi lene kaa crez is kadar bad gaya he ki public gadering ho yaa koi privet okeshan har koi ek duusare ke saath selfi lete nazar aata he
 The increasing craze of people towards selfies has given rise to many mental and physical illnesses in which 'selfie elbow' is the most unique and new edition
 roj subah khaali pet khaaen ye fal, paas nahin fatkengi bimaariyaan!kya he selfi albo- 'tennis albo' or ' golf albo' kaa naam to apane pehle suna hi hoga par ab 'selfi albo' ke liye bhi taiyaar ho jaaie
 In order to take selfie from our mobile again and again, we forget that our hands and especially elbows are stressed
 or agar ham selfi lene kaa silsilaa lambey samay tak jari rakhte he to kuch samay baad hamaari kohni main dard shuru ho jaataa he jise selfi albo kaa naam diya gaya he
 Actually, to take a selfie, we have to lift our hand up by holding a mobile or selfie stick, which makes our elbow automatically folded
 or lambey samay ke liye isi pojishan main bane rahane se hamaari kohni ke masal main sprain yaa khinchaav mahasoos hone lagata he
 And this stretch gradually turns into muscle injury
 jisase kohni main lagaataar dard bana rahata he, dard ke saath saath sujan bhi ho jaati he or sujan ke kam hone ke baad vah nishaan ban jaataa he
 After the selfie elbow, the flexibility of our elbow muscle begins to decrease gradually and often people do not pay much attention to it, and continue the process of taking selfies
 iske chalate yah samasya gambhir rup akhtiyaar kar leti he or hamaari kohni ke har movement par dard badhata hi jaataa he
 You will get rid of pimples, if you do these home remedies, it will cause elbow injury later on, in which the movements of our hands can almost stop
 samay rahete doctorl madad nahi lee to ye samasya taumr aapako sata sakati he
 Such cases have not come to the fore in India, but one of the reasons may be lack of awareness among people
 zyaadaatar logon ko pataa hi nahi chalata ke unke haath me hone vaale dard kaa conection unki selfi kii lat ke chalate bhi ho saktaa he
 Selfitis disease- Dr
 Sameer Malhotra, director of Mental Health and Behavior Signs at Max Super Specialty Hospital, says, "it's a way of taking selfies, taking selfies repeatedly, posing in different positions is a way to have a self-obsessive disorder
" Which is called "selfitis" today
 yah ek tareeke kii mental ilnes he jisame vyakti khud main itnaa kho jaataa he ki use ghar parivaar kii sud nahin hoti
 Such a person or youth suffers from a lack of feeling in themselves
 or ek kaalpanik duniya me kho jate he jahaan unki filter kii gai selfies ko hazaron likes milte he'
 People suffering from self-injury are the victim of obsessive complusion disorder
 or unka sara samay sirf khud ko nihaarne or selfi or use apadet yaa aplod karne main biit jaataa he
 Symptoms: - Individuals or young people suffering from selfitis will be seen taking selfies from mobile phones several times a day
 - aise yuva har maukey ko apane phone main kaid karne main vyast rahete hai
 - Social media has more friends than actual friends of such youth
 - soshal media par jarurat se zyada samay online rah kar photose aplod karte hai or dusron ke likes or prashansa ke bhukhe hote hai
 - The family relationship of such youth is affected, and their social life is negligible
 -tanaav, gussa, chidchidapan, apano se har vaqt naaraaz rahanaa or akele rahane par jor dena sabase mahatvapurn lakshan hai
 Repeated selfies can lead to many more problems, including the facial skin being dry with more exposure to the mobile flush light, and premature wrinkles

 Wishing the party victory in Gujarat elections, Shatrughan Sinha taunted PM Modi that if he is defeated in this election, he will have to be ready for abusive language
 Humble appeal to our one man show & two man army
 Please return "home" to Delhi, if we've exhausted all our tricks, tantrums, wrong statements & tall promises
 Time to also bring back the ministers,ministries & Govt
 Sitting in Gujarat & fighting amongst themselves to get credit— Shatrughan Sinha (@shatrugansinha) December 13, 2017 In his first tweet, Shatrughan Sinha attacked PM Modi and Shah's leadership, saying that his 'one man show' and 'two man army' 'is requested to come back to Delhi
 shatrughna sinha ne kaha ki agar aapaki sari chaalen, nakhre, galat bayani or bade bade vaadein khatm ho gaye hon to waapas dilli chale aaen
 Shatrughan Sinha further said that the time has come that all the ministers and the government which is sitting in Gujarat and those who are fighting amongst themselves to take credit, should also be brought back
 
 
 
 If we are victorious, we know you shall get full credit
 
 but if we are not, then who will take the rap? There's an old saying - "taali kaptaan ko to gaali bhi kaptaan ko"
 Hope wish and pray that we get only Taalis in Gujarat elections
 Jai Hind! - Shatrughan Sinha (@shatrugansinha) December 13, 2017 In another tweet, Shatrughan Sinha spoke on the Gujarat election results
 unke anusaar agar chunaav main jeet hui to unhen puraa credit milegaa, lekin agar jeet nahin hui to jimmedaari kiski banegi? kiske sir iljaam hoga?shatrughna sinhake anusaar ek puraani kahawat he ki ''tali captain ko to gaali bhi captain ko

 According to police, during this time, the family heard the scream of the teenager
 ve baag main pahunche, to do darindon kii karatuut dekh sann rah gaye
 Family members caught Sahib Singh on the spot
 deepak andhera hone ke kaaran bhaagane main safal ho gaya
 He is looking for dilli ke laal kile main rashtriya raksha mahayajna kaa aayojan kiya ja rahaa he
 The important thing is that through this yagna, the Goddess of Gods, the enemy Destroyer, and the Goddess of power, the Goddess Bagalamukhi will be invoked
 jaahir he vipaksh is mahayajna ko BJP ke hindutv card ke taur par dekh rahi he
 General elections are to be held next year, in such a situation, the BJP is also hoping to accomplish two goals with this Mahayagya
 ek to apane siyaasi shatruon kaa vinaash or doosraa rajpaat main safalataa
 108 Yagna Kund will be constructed if only on the figures, then xxrep 4 1 Brahmins 2 in 108 Yagna Kund
 25 karod mantron kaa uccharan karenge
 Experts say that for many years, Yagya of Bagalamukhi Mata was not organized on such a large scale
 iske saath hi bijepi desh kii rajdhani se2019aam chunaav kaa bigul foonkane kii taiyaari main he
 The soil will be brought from every corner of the country, for the Yagya Kund of this program held from 18 to 25 March next month, the soil will be brought from village to village, house to house and every corner of the country
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki chaaron dham or tamaam tirthasthalon kii mitti se yajna kunda banaae jaaenge
 Invitations to the PM and the President will also take part in this yagya, sages from all over the country, as well as businessmen and leaders have also been invited
 is yajna ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi or raashtrapati ramnath kovind ko bhi aamantrit kiya gaya he
 BJP MP Mahesh Giri, BJP MP, is busy in organizing Mahayagya himself and for this he has also set up an office in his house
 mahesh giri ne kaha, 'yajna hamaare shatru ke vinaash ke liye he chaahe vah bhitari shatru ho yaa bahari shatru jo bhi desh kaa bura chaah rahaa he uskaa is yajna se vinaash hoga or desh kii janata is yajna main hissaa legi
 With the utterance of these mantras, resolutions like the country's security system, women's safety, environmental protection will be fulfilled
 'rath yatra se jutai jaaegi havan kunda ke liye mittikendriya mantri nitin gadakari se lekar rajnath singh yajna ke aayojan main apana yogadan denge
 Significantly, Rajnath Singh will give the green signal to a chariot journey, which will go to every corner of the country and collect soil for the Yagna Kund
 yahaan tak ki jammu-kashmir main sarhad or doklam se bhi mitti mangai jaaegi taaki rashtriya suraksha ke liye bhi aradhana kii ja sake
 BJP taking recourse to Yagya after failure: Congress, however, the opposition alleged that BJP is shining its politics through religion
 congress netaa randeep surajevaala ne kaha, 'yajna or puja hamaari samskruti kaa ek hissaa he, lekin jis tarah se bijepi sarkaar har ek mudde par vifal hone ke baad yajna kaa sahaara le le le rahi he, vah chintaa kaa vishay he
 Along with this, where BJP is preparing to blow its election bugle
 vahiin yah saaf ho gaya he ki bhagava party ke liye 2019 aam chunaav kii ladaai hindutv ke raste se hokar hi nikalati he
 It remains to be seen how the Congress and other opposition parties find a cut in this battle of originals and duplicates
 vaise to hamaari duniya ne na jane kitne ballebaaj dekhe

 The Indian team management, who have been in controversies since the start of the England tour, tried to keep a clear distance from the media by not sending any players to the press conference on Tuesday before the second ODI against England
 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne pehle vanade match se purv samvaadadaata sammelan main dancan flachar ko ‘bos’ ghoshit kiya or kaha ki vah vishwa cap 2015 tak team se jude rahenge
 His statement created a ruckus
 bisisiai ne dhoni ke bayaan par kadaa ruukh apanaate hue kaha tha ki unhone seemaa langhi he or bhartiya captain ko is tarah kii tippanee nahin kerani chahie thi
 The BCCI has also decided to discuss it in the next meeting of the executive
 dhoni ne haalanki aaj samvaadadaata sammelan main nahin aane kaa faisla kiya or bhartiya team prabandhan ne bhi media kaa saamana karne ke liye kisi anya khilaadi ko nahin bheja
 The move is being seen as avoiding any other controversy
 bhartiya team ke test shrinkhalaa main lachar pradarshan ke baad ravi shastri ko cricket nideshak niyukt karne ke faisle par media ne sawaal uthaaye the ki aakhri team kaa asli ‘bos’ koun he
 The Indian team sweated the net a lot today
 is dauraan flachar or shastri donon maujuud the, lekin jab samvaadadaata sammelan kaa vakt aayaa to ek sandesh bhijwa diya gaya ki bhartiya team kii taraf se koi bhi media ko sambodhit karne ke liye nahin aayega
