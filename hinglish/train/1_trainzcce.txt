 abhi or pragna jab trial room se baahar aate hai to aalia abhi se safai maangati he
 In response, Abhi makes excuses, stating that he and Pragya were helping each other choose clothes

 Pragya is quite happy with this situation and tells Tanu that she and her husband are liking clothes for each other

 abhi usase kahata he ki vah uske liye sagaai ke kapade lekar aayaa he or uske donon sabase achche doston kii sagaai ho rahi he isliye vah behad khush he
 Although Abhi tells East that he does not want to get engaged, everyone else is shocked except for Pragya

 Abhi tells him that he has brought engagement clothes for her and both of her best friends are getting engaged so she is very happy
 haalanki abhi purab se kahata he vah sagaai nahin karnaa chahta, purab kii is baat se pragna ke alaava baaki sab chaunk jate hai

 raajnneeti ke jaal main aisa fansaa ki banakar taiyaar hone ke ek maah baad bhi iskaa locarpan sarkari kaamkaajon main atka rahaa
 The funny thing in this is that when it was launched today, the Congress and BJP came face to face and the bridge was released from both the ends
 darasal, brij kaa udghaatan ek maah se atka hua tha
 The government kept avoiding its inauguration by saying that they did not have time
 jiske chalate congress ne yah ultimatum diya ki yadi brij kaa locarpan nahin hua to congress khud iskaa locarpan kar degi
 After the Congress announcement, the government awakened and decided to inaugurate the bridge in a hurry
 locarpan kii taarikh 24 sitambar rakhi, lekin jab sarkaar ko pataa laga ki congress 21 sitambar ko locarpan karne vaali he to achaanak locarpan kii taarikh 24 se badalakar 21 sitambar kar di gai
 This was the reason that today, Gujarat Government Minister Nanu Vanani Bridge on one side of the bridge inaugurated, Congress workers on the other end drove vehicles on the bridge and opened it to the general public, declaring it inaugurated
 congressi kaaryakartaaon ne brij par vaahan chalaane se pehle 'jai sardaar jai patidaar' ke naare lagaae
 When Congress workers arrived by driving on the bridge, the people of BJP and Congress came face to face
 haalanki, brij ke udghaatan ke dauraan tanaav kaa andeshaa hone ke chalate police ne badi taadaad main yahaan force utaari thi
 Due to which the matter was settled in a peaceful manner
 congress ne is brij ko swaminaryan sampradaay ke sant pramukh swami ke naam par pramukh swami brij naam diya he
 However, this time the way the BJP and the Congress are coming face-to-face before the elections, it will be very interesting to see how much this battle dominates the voters during the elections

 On the question of bjp's posters being removed by the Bengal government citing the Election Commission before the rally, Shah said that only our posters have been removed

 What more reason can there be for a national president than this
 agar mamata didi aisa samajhati hai ki is prakaar kii hinsa karke wo bhaajapa ko roak dengi, apni haar ko roak lengi, to jitna hinsa kaa keechad faillaayengi, utana hi shandaar camel khilegaa

 On Mamta Didi's accusation of BJP workers coming to the CRPF uniform, Shah said that Didi thinks that as the Bengal government is running, the Indian government is also running

 a young man lost his life by falling into a white tiger enclosure in a zoo in Delhi
 makasuud naam ke is yuvak kii dardanaak maut ke baad ab chidyaghar prashasan par sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 The question is also serious because the administration had a full 10 minutes to save Maqsood, which was lost
 jaise hi makasuud baagh ke baade main gira, uske baad 10 minute tak prashasan ke karmchaariyon ne koi kadam nahin uthaaya
 There were some measures, which could save the young man's life by adopting it
 sabase pehle to chidyaghar main latakane vaali seedhi kaa intjaam hona chahie tha
 If a ladder made with the help of rope was hung in the tiger's enclosure, the young man's life could have been saved
 makasuud ke girane ke bahut der baad tak baagh ekadam shant hi rahaa
 In this case, this remedy could prove to be effective
 duusari baat yah ki baagh ko vakt rahete nashe kii sui (tranquilizer Gun) se behosh bhi kiya ja saktaa tha
 This would have easily controlled the tiger and saved the life of Maqsood
 saat saal kaa safed baagh apane baade main gire 27 saal ke makasuud ko 15 minute se bhi zyada samay tak tadapaa-tadpaakar martha rahaa, lekin usko bachaane ke liye paanch minute ke andar istemaal main aane vaali tranculizer gan maukey se kareeb 250 meter dur chidyaghar ke aspataal main padi rahi
 Tranquilizer gun is also called 'capture gun' or 'dirt gun'
 khatarnaak jaanwaron ko bina chot pahunchaae kaabo main karne va pakadaney ke liye desh ke sabhi chidyagharon va jangalon main lambey samay se tranculizer gan kaa istemaal kiya jaataa rahaa he
 In this gun, there is a needle-like bullet, which within a minute, spreads the intoxicating chemical in the body and the animal falls unconscious
 sarkari niyam ke mutabik khatarnaak jaanwaron ke paas tranculizer gan ke saath teen karmchaariyon kii tainaati honi chahie
 These employees should have a keeper, an assistant keeper and an attendant
 ve tab tak tainaat rahenge, jab tak chidyaghar aam logon ke liye khulaa rahata he
 But with only two truncular guns in the capital's zoo, it was not being used
 vah aspataal main padi rahati thi or karmchaaree nihathe khatarnaak jaanwaron ke baade ke paas khadey rahete the
 Even if zoo workers were quick to help Maqsood in crossing the barrier in the tiger enclosure, the young man probably would not have lost his life
 baharhaal, chidyaghar prashasan ne kuch upaay na karke yuvak ko apane haal par chhod diya, jiskaa nateeja sabake saamne he
 In Delhi, the Bharatiya Janata Party has made it clear that it is in favor of both elections and government formation
 dilli pradesh bhaajapa ke adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay ne aaj party ke varisht netaa or kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh se mulaakaat ke baad media se kaha ki bhaajapa chunaav ke liye taiyaar he
 He also said that the party is also ready to form the government
 lekin, yah maamla dilli ke uparajyapal ko tay karnaa he
 Significantly, the political stirring in Delhi is at the peak, and if sources are to be believed, BJP has already held in-house talks with six Congress mlas to form the government
 darasal, baatcheet mahinebhar se chal rahi thi, lekin ab media main khabaren aa jane se aarope-pratyarope or siyaasi sajishon kaa daur bhi shuru ho gaya he
 a BJP MLA also says that everything is almost clear, and now just waiting for the green signal from the high command
 udhar, congress ke vidhayak mohammad asif ne bhi yah daawa kar siyaasi halkon main halchal machaa di thi ki aam aadmi party bhi vidhayakon kii kharid-farokht ke jariye sarkaar banane kaa prayaas kar rahi he or unhen 'aap' sarkaar ko samarthan dene ke badale cabinet mantri kaa darja dene kii peshkash kii gai thi
 At the same time, the Aam Aadmi Party has been accusing BJP of buying and selling
 aam aadmi party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne dilli ke uparajyapal najeeb jang se mulaakaat kaa vakt maanga tha, lekin uparajyapal ne somvaar ke baad mulaakaat ko sambhav bataaya he
 Earlier, Kejriwal tweeted, if a party (BJP) has already refused to form the government, can the Lt
 Governor re-invite that party in the same assembly
 
 
 kya uparajyapal ko pehle samarthan dene vaale vidhayakon kii suchi nahin maangani chahie, varna uparajyapal ek party kaa saath dete najar nahin aaenge

 Actress Renuka Shahane has now commented on the ban on the film
 unhone soshal media par kaha he ki ellection kamishan ko raajnneetik partiyon par focus karnaa chahie na ki filmon or tivi serials par
 Renuka Shahane wrote on her Twitter account - "I do not support the postponement of any film
 yadi hamaare sensor board ise paas kar detaa he or yadi jis vyakti par film aadhaarit he, uske parivaar ko isse koi aapatti na ho
 The Election Commission should focus on political parties to see that they are following the rules and not on films and TV serials
 ''I don't support the postponing of any film if our censor board has passed it & if the family members of the person on whom the film is based have no objections
 The EC should concentrate on political parties to see that they're adhering to the rules rather than films & tv serials

 He played the character of Villan in many films but the role for which he went to Taumra was Gabbar's character in 'sholay'

 India's vast railway network has often seen passengers complaining of bad food, but some new services related to fast food may have brought some change in this experience
 kentki frid chikan se lekar dominos pizza tak alag alag tarah ke vyanjan aajkal yatriyon kii pahunch main aa chuke hai, wo bhi sirf ek smartphone ap ke zarie
 For a passenger like Amit V, such services are as if sent by God because he was tired of eating the train food for years which he did not like at all
 peshey se shikshak amit 19 ghante kii yatra karke mathura se pashchim bharat kii ore ja rahe hai
 He explains that 'this food is 100 times better than railway food
 ' mathura stesan par delivery karne vaale aman singh badhuri bheed ko chirate hue apane customer kii seat par khaanaa pahunchaate hai or pement lekar train chhootane se ek minute pehle utar jate hai
 However, a few years ago, there were not many options for food for the passengers
 khaane main cockroach milane jaisi shikaayat jaise kaaphi aam si baat ho gai thi, yahaan tak kii ek andruni report ke li hone se yah baat bhi saamne ai ki 'gandi, badboodaar or pani se bhari pentry car' main khaanaa pakaaya jaataa he
 In one case, the samosas were seen placed in a mopping bucket
 yahi nahin khaane main vividhta kii maang bhi bad rahi thi jisamen yatri antarrashtriya or fast food khaane ke saath hi sthaneey swaad ko bhi aazmaana chaah rahe the
 This new service is actually a part of the process of modernizing the railway network of India in which more than two crore people travel every day
 bataa den ki asia kaa yah sabase purana rail network darasal bharat ke 100 karod bees lakh logon kii jivan rekha he lekin pichley kuch dashakon se isaki sevaaon kii kaaphi andekhi ho rahi he
 Last year, the government announced a five-year modernization plan worth more than $ 10 billion, including free wi-fi connectivity with Google at some stations
 pichley saal bhartiya railway ne keeffsi jaisi food chen ko i-katering sevaaon ke liye anubandhit karne ke liye nyauta diya tha taaki yatri ahm steshnon par phone yaa online ke jariye pehle hi khaane kaa order de saken
 Railway Ministry spokesperson Anil Kumar Saxena said that the next step would be to set up base kitchens at major stations so that companies can deliver fresh food and deliver in trains
 is avasar kaa laabh kai nijee udhyami bhi uthaanaa chaahate hai jaise ki pushapinder singh jinhone 2012 main apni patni ke saath milakar (travel khaanaa) kii shuruuaat kii thi
 The company contracts with restaurants near the station and takes delivery services from them for a fee
 tippaniyan Singh said that 'there are about 5000 trains on the long route that travel for an average of 770 km but only six per cent of them are able to provide good food services
 ham isi section par dhyaan de rahe hai
 However, speed will play an important role before these services are successful - delivery services have only a few minutes in which they have to find their customer and deliver before the train leaves

 ) However, a few years ago, there were not many options for food for the passengers

 All are in aggressive mode to become winners
 sambhav he ki phinale se pehle dabl aviction ho
 On social media, fans are doing aggressive publicity in support of their favorite contestants
 kai saare fainpej or hashtag trend main hai
 The date was 11 October
 dopaher baad teen bajane vaale the ki meraa phone ghanaghnane laga
 Seeing the 'unknown number' (unknown number), i started thinking about who could be who
 sachin tendulkar se to subah hi lambii-chaudee baatcheet hui he, ve to ho nahin sakate
 Why would they call? isi udhedbun main maine phone uthaaya
 Sachin said without a hitch, "I thought i should tell you that i have made up my mind to retire after the West Indies series
" maine apana faisla bisisiai ko bataa diya he
 "I did not understand for a while
 pichley dhai saal se unki aatmakatha par kaam karne ke dauraan unase is bare main kai baar baat hui he
 We also talked about this matter every morning in the morning
 phir bhi mujhe iskaa katai andaja na tha
 After being stunned for a while, as i regained consciousness
 lekin sachin kii aawaaj shant or santulit thi, “bhavuk mat bano
 Anjali (his wife) and Ajit (his brother) are getting emotional
 mujhe ritairement ke pehle hi ritair cricketer kii tarah na pesh karo
 "and then laughingly said," i still have to play two Tests and i want to play properly
 ”sachin west indies shrunkhlaa kii yojana bananaa shuru kar chuke the
 He had an idea of what was going to happen around him in the next few weeks, so he had decided to separate himself from the tide and excitement of this sentimentality
 ab vakt alavida kehane kii vela kii taiyaari kaa tha
 Midnight had passed and the master blaster Sachin was awake
 ve samooche bharat ko apane agosh main le chuki ghoshnaa se santulan kaayam karne kii koshish kar rahe the; ve us hakeekat ko sweekaar karne kii koshish kar rahe the ki unhone cricket ke khel ko alavida kehane kaa faisla kiya he jo 30 saal se unki jindagi rahaa he
 What would it be like to retire after the age of forty? What will they do after November 19? Have future plans been prepared? These are difficult questions and there are no definite answers to them yet
 sachaai to yah he ki unhone bhi abhi is par vichaar hi nahin kiya he
 Those who know Sachin know that they are not ready to face retirement yet
 abhi unke saamne ek daayitv puraa karne ko haih aakhri baar bharat ke liye maidan main utarane kaa
 Right now this is in his mind
 ritair hone ke baad unke liye teen alag-alag sambhaavnaaen hai
 One, as confirmed by Nita Ambani, Sachin will play a key role for the Mumbai Indian in the 2014 IPL
 duusare, rajyasabha sadsy ke rup main, sachin hameshaa hi jamini str par khel ke vikaas main yogadan karne kii ichha paalate aae hai
 He presented a study paper this year to the Ministries of Human Resource Development and Sports about further plans
 ve un yojanaon par aage kaam karnaa chahenge
 Finally, they want to spend time at home with Anjali and the children — Arjun and Sara — who are left unfinished due to their busy playing
 ab ve apana kitbag khunti par taangane kaa faisla kar chuke hai, to unke liye cricket kaa arth kya rah jayega? isi sawaal ke jawaab main unke ritairement ke baad jindagi kaa raaj jaanane main madad mil sakegi
 Simply put, cricket is his life
 yahi unka jajba, jeevika, udhyam or pesha he
 i asked him about his retirement plan in early 2012 in the middle of the Australia Test series
 main unase jaananaa chaah rahaa tha ki unke jivan par jo kitaab main likh rahaa hum, use sametane ke bare main unke kya vichaar hai
 He said to Tapak, "if we don't talk about it now, good
 ham dekhenge ki kab ham us mukaam par pahunchate hai
 "it was not difficult to read the apprehensions that arose in his eyes," he said
 maano ve cricket khilne ke liye hi paidaa hue hai or use ek din chhod dene kaa vichaar hi unke liye daraavna he
 In the end maybe the records, the accolades, the figures do not matter
 bas ve yahi chaahate hai ki balla uthaaen or apane 22 gaj ke mandir kii ore daud jaaen
 That is their only shelter and they are now being left behind
 sachin ke alavida kehane kaa khyaal jaahir karne ke kai din baad maine unase aagrah kiya ki pustak ke agle adhyay ke liye ve kuch samay nikaal len
 It is necessary to record what prompted them to make the announcement
 sachin ne koi ruchi nahin dikhaai
 He was focused on preparing for the match of the West Indies
 usamen ve behtareen pradarshan karnaa chaahate the
 He said, "after this series is over, let us focus on the book
 abhi main agle kuch hafte abhyaas par dhyaan dena chahta hum
 "it was easy to conclude that he would play a Ranji Trophy match against Haryana to get into the right frame
 lekin lahali main unke saath kya hona he, iskaa andaja hamen nahin tha
 At the end of the first day's play, he wrote, "there was a lot of greenery on the pitch
 ” ve pehali pari main 5 ran banaakar achaanak uthi gend par out ho gaye the
 In the second innings, Mumbai had lost the opening wicket while chasing 236 runs
 sachin jaanate the ki unhen kya karnaa he
 This is what they have been doing for 24 years
 is baar unhone mumbai ke liye aakhri match jitau 79 ranon kii pari kheli
 They knew that the whole country was watching
 ve yah bhi jaanate the ki itihaas main pehali baar ranjai trophy ke maichon ke prati deewangi saas-bahu serial jaisi tiarapy hasil kar legi
 After the match, he wrote, "really good preparation
 pich main gendbaajon ke liye kaaphi kuch tha
 God is great
 ” kya ve dakshin africa shrunkhlaa kii taiyaari kii baat kar rahe the yaa kolkata or vankhede ke do maichon kii? kya ve, ek pal ko, yah bhul gaye ki ve dakshin africa nahin ja rahe hai? unhen hari ghaas vaali pich eden garden yaa vankhede main to nahin milane vaali thi, to phir kiski taiyaari kii baat kar rahe the?sachin kolkata main 3 november kii raat pahunche
 That is, one day before the time of arrival for a Test match
 agali subah 10 baje se bhartiya team kaa abhyaas chal rahaa tha
 They could catch a flight early in the morning on the 4th
 unhen ghar par diwali na manaanaa manjuur tha lekin unke liye apane 199 waan test kaa abhyaas chhodia manjuur nahin tha
 When we met at the Taj Bengal Hotel on 4 November, we could get to know their attention to specifics
 sachin apane balle ke saath mashgool the
 The logo was slightly torn under the bat
 maine unase poocha ki yah kaise hua, “aakhri maukey par balle kaa lamination kiya gaya or jab aap oochaal bhari pich par khelte hai to, jaisaa lahali main tha, kinaaraa lag saktaa he
 i do not want to give this opportunity
 ” itani baariki par dhyaan khel hi nahin, kisi bhi kshetra main apwaad swaroop hi dekhne ko milti he
 One of his key rivals, Alan Donald, says, "his preparation distinguishes him from Ponting and Lara
" yahi pichley dhai dashakon se unke bane rahane kaa raaj he
 "anjali and Arjun were also two unexpected viewers on the first day in Eden
 un donon main se kisi ke aane kii ummid nahin thi or sachin unhen dekhakar chaunk gaye
 Anjali had been saying for two weeks that she did not want to go to Kolkata because it would distract Sachin
 aakhri maukey par ve khud ko roak nahin pain
 Anjali says, "at the birthday party of Mrs
 Nita Ambani, an Aziz friend of mine told me that after a few days you will never get this chance in your life
" vah bada daraavna ehsaas tha or jab sachin kolkata ke liye nikalne lage to unhone kaha ki aakhri baar main kisi test match main shahar se baahar jane ke liye tumhen gudbai kah rahaa hum
 i could not stop my tears when they left for the airport
 tabhi maine kolkata jane kaa iraadaa bana liya
 Sachin is happy to see Anjali with Arjun
 pehle din ke khel ke baad ve apane kamare main unke saath ek ghante bitaa paae
 He gave a ball to Arjun which he took to Mumbai
 anjali hanskar kahati hai, “ham ghantebhar saath rahe lekin us dauraan bhi ek baar bhi sachin ne balle ko apane se dur nahin kiya
 "they were busy preparing for their innings the next day
 haalanki yah jaruri nahin ki acchhee taiyaari se hameshaa achche nattejey nikalen
 The ball hit the pad above Sachin's knee and umpire Nigel Long's finger got up while the ball was clearly going over the stumps
 sachin jaan gaye ki ab mauka khatm
 With Rohit Sharma's first Test century, India were scoring runs and the West Indies were shaken by Shami Ahmed's good bowling
 sachin ke paas ab ballebaaji karne kii vankhede main bas do sambhaavnaaen thim
 He was also surprised to wonder why in his case the best umpires Simon Toffel, Aleem Dar, Rod Tuckner, and Nigel Long sometimes miss the practice
 kya unki chhavi ampiron par atirikt dabaav bana detii he? sachin in sawaalon ko bahes ke liye chhodkar apane aakhri test ke liye mumbai ravaanaa hue
 Anjali wanted to see the grand success of her husband but she was left heartbroken
 haalanki kolkata ne aanshik rup se is niraashaa kii bharpai kii
 The impression of a magnificent farewell will always be on his mind
 saurabh ganguli ne jaise apane cricket ke sabase pyaare dost sachin ko gale lagaaya, usase eden garden ke darshak bhi dang rah gaye
 Sachin was very emotional
 unhen isse bhi khushi hui ki 199 kilo gulab kii pankhudibhan un par nahin daali gayi, jaisi ki pehle yojana thi
 a close friend of his, Vivek Palkar, laughed and said, “he would have been overwhelmed
 ” is par kolkata pahunche unke ek or bachapan ke dost ne chutki lee, “kam se kam usamen se acchhee khushboo aati
 "he went to see their match
 vankhede kii vela ai to sachin phir taiyaari main jute gaye
 They started preparing for what they are known for - preparation for perfection
 yah mauka unke liye isliye bhi khaas he ki pehali baar unki maa rajani darshakon main shaamil hongi
 Shortly after the Kolkata Test was over, Sachin reminded his friends in Kanpur a pair of special shoes for his ailing mother to make it easier to walk in Wankhede
 stadium main ek ramp unki nigaraanee main bana hi he
 On the eve of the last Test, Sachin's close friends organized a party in his honor
 iskaa aayojan bachapan ke dost sunil harshe ne kiya he
 They call it a personal gift from the 'sachin Gang' to the legendary player
 india today ke 12 november ko ‘salaam sachin’ kanklev main anjali ne kaha, “ham har pal ko jeena chaahate hai

 In this video, both Jhansi District Collector Shivasahay Awasthi and SSP OP Singh are seen together

 is video kii pushti karte hue encounter main maare gaye pushpendra yadav ke bhai rabindra yadav kehete hai, "7 oktober ko jhaansi ke dm or esaspi donon ne unako dhamkee di
 When we did not do the last rites of the body of the brother, he got angry
 hamane prarthana patr dekar risiving maangi to dm ne naukari se nikalwane kii dhamkee di he
 Now the whole family is being bullied
 ''beete 5 oktober kii raat jhaansi ke kargavaan khurd gaanv ke pushpendra yadav ko jhaansi police ne encounter main maar giraane kaa daawa kiya tha
 After this, Pushpendra's family accused the police of showing fake encounters as fake encounters
 is ghatana ke baad kargavaan gaanv se bahi siyasat kii garm hawa ne pradesh bhar ko apni jad main liya
 Several big leaders, including Akhilesh Yadav, reached here and questioned the Yogi government of the state and their police, and accused Pushpendra Yadav of killing him
 iske baad puure pradesh main pushpendra yadav ko insaaf dilaane ke liye dharna pradarshan shuru ho gaye
 a viral video has further embroiled the case amid questions arising over the intriguing theory of Pushpendra Yadav's much-talked about encounter case
 viral video main jhaansi jile ke jiladhikari shivasahaay avasthi ek samvedanheen avatar main najar aa rahe hai
 Confirming the video, Ravindra Yadav, brother of the deceased Pushpendra Yadav, says, "on October 7, the District Magistrate Shivasahay Awasthi and SSP OP Singh were threatening to get him fired
 jab hamane insaaf nahin milane par pushpendra kaa shav nahin liya to hamaare parivaar par dabaav banaaya gaya
 When we gave the tahir for killing the brother, we refused to give the receipt and threatened us, the job will go now
 ek latter likhakar bhej denge ki kanoon main baadha utpann kar rahe hai to naukari chali jaaegi
 You will sit down at home
 ''video saamne aane ke baad ek baar phir logon ne ise prashasnic taanaashaahee qaraar diya he
 People say that after the encounter there was a body of brother on one side and on the other hand his brother CISF jawan Ravindra Yadav was being threatened

 Rajya Sabha MP Dr
 chandrapal yadav kehete hai, ''pushpendra yadav encounter main pehle din se police dabaav banaate hue parivaar ko sata rahi he
 After the arrival of this video, it has become clear that even the senior officers of the district administration are involved in creating a false story of this encounter
 ham pushpendra ke parivaar ko insaaf dilaakar hi dam lenge
 "the officer who is responsible for the investigation, is giving the same threat: Ravindra Yadav's brother Pushpendra Yadav's brother has said that his family is constantly being threatened
" jhaansi jile ke jis dm par magistrial jaanch karaane kaa jimmaa he vahi hamako dhamka rahaa he
 Now who are threatening us and pressurizing us, how will they conduct a fair investigation
 ravindra ne kaha ki pushpendra kii hatya ke baad unki daadi thakurine dulia kii sadame main maut ho gai
 The family is broken after two deaths
 hamaara puraa parivaar jaan de degaa
 The district administration is sending a false story to the government while suppressing the truth
 vahiin mritak pushpendra kii patni shivangi yadav kahati hai, "mujhe mere pati kaa shav tak nahin dikhaaya gaya
 Police killed him in a money transaction
 shav ko bhi police ne petrol daalkar phoonk diya
 Within three months of my marriage, my demand was dismantled by the police and now the crimes are being done in place of justice

 -input bhashaa se Dharamshala Test will be played as the decisive Test of the 4 match series
 match se pehle sawaal ye he ki kya australian team 13 saal main pehali bharat bharat main test series jeet paaegi yaa phir team india lagaataar chhathi test series jeetne main kaamyaab rahegi? team india ke upar is test se pehle thodaa zyaada dabaav hoga, kyonki agar test drow hua or series barabari par khatm hui, to border-gavaskar trophy australia ke paas hi rahegi
 There is doubt about the playing of Indian captain Virat Kohli
 agar wo feet nahin hue to ballebaazon kii zimmedaari bad jaaegi
 KL Rahul, Cheteshwar Pujara are in form, but Rahane's bat is a bit quieter
 viraat kohli ne match se pehle kaha ki "is match main series daanv par lagi he, donon tiimon ke khilaadi maidan par utarane ko betaab hai
 There will be enthusiasm in the audience too
 ye bahut dilachasp series rahi he or main ummid karata hum ki sahi tareeke se ye series khatm ho" ballebaazon ke alaava focus gendbaazon par bhi hoga, kyonki dharmashala kii pich se tej gendbaazon ko pehle 2 din thodaa madad milane kii ummid kii ja rahi he or saath hi dharmashala kii hawa main thodi swing bhi gend zarur karegi
 In such a situation, the Indian team management should go with 4 bowlers or 5, this question must be bothering them
 eshanth par bharosa rakhaa jaae yaa phir bhubaneshwar umesh ke jodidar banaae jaae ye khyaal coach kumble ke man main zarur hoga? tippaniyan Are there any doubts about Mohammed Shami playing? Virat also realizes that in his view, the pitch of Dharamshala is good for everyone
 viraat ne kaha ki "ye acchhee cricketting wicket he, jahaan par har ek ke liye kuch na kuch he
 
 
 
 ballebaaz tik jane ke baad apane shots khel sakate hai, tej gendbaazon ko shuruuaat main madad milegi or puure match ko dauraan spinners ko oochaal"
 At the same time, the Australian camp is doing everything possible to win
 "mind game" ke jariye bharat par dabaav badhaayaa ja rahaa he
 The way he managed to save the Test in Ranchi has encouraged the players
 steve smith, glen maxwell or pat kamins kii lay dharmashala test main bharat ke liye sabase bada khatra he
 Steve Smith said that "we are happy with the 1-1 draw at the moment and the stage is set for the fourth Test, the players are excited to play"
 number 1 team india kii jahaan saakh daanv par he, vahiin australia haarana bilkul nahin chahta, kyonki isse series ke saath saath wo apni number 2 kii ranking bhi gavaan denge
 Virat Kohli said before the match that "in this match the series is at stake, the players of both teams are desperate to get on the field
" darshakon main bhi utsaah zarur hoga
 It has been a very interesting series and i hope to finish the series in the right way "apart from the batsmen, the focus will also be on the bowlers, because the Dharamsala pitch is expected to help the fast bowlers a little in the first 2 days and Also, a little swing in the air of Dharamshala will definitely make the ball
 aise main bhartiya team management 4 gendbaazon ke saath jaae yaa 5, ye sawaal unhe zarur pareshaan kar rahaa hoga
 Is Ishant to be trusted or will Bhubaneswar be made Umesh's partner, will it be in the mind of coach Kumble? The comments mohammad shami ke khilne par bhi sanshay he? viraat ko bhi iskaa ehsaas he unki nazar main dharmashala kii pich sabake liye acchhee he
 Virat said that "it is a good cricketing wicket where there is something for everyone
" 
 
 
 The batsmen can play their shots once they last, the fast bowlers will get the start and the spinners bounce during the entire match ”

 ranchi main jis tareeke se wo test bachaane main kaamyaab rahe isse khilaadiyon kaa hausala badha hua he
 The rhythm of Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell and Pat Cummins is the biggest threat to India in the Dharamshala Test
 steve smith ne kaha ki "1-1 kii barabari par is vakt hone se ham khush he or chauthe test ke liye stage set he, khilaadi khilne ko utsahit hai"

 Road construction began in the area after that protest
 sadak nirmaan puraa hone ke baad ravat khud bhi kshetra main aae the

 sakshartaa mishan kii lambey samay se ek tag line rahi he ki padhane-likhane kii koi umr nahin hoti, jab chahen shuru ho jaaen
 This tagline is brought to life by Bhagirathi Amma of Kerala
 bachapan se padhai ke liye lalak rakhane vaali bhagirathi ne 105 saal kii umr main apni khwaahish puri kii he
 Now people are giving their example
 unhone rajya sakshartaa mishan ke tahat chauthe varg ke baraabar kii pariksha main hissaa liya he
 She told the media that she always wanted to study, wanted to acquire knowledge
 lekin, bachapan main hi maa kii maut ho jane ke kaaran unhen apana ye sapana chhodana padaa
 After the mother left, the responsibility of taking care of the siblings fell on her
 in tamaam paristhitiyon se jab wo ubareen or ghar gruhasthi sanbhali to ek or dukh kaa pahaad un par tut gaya
 Her husband died at the age of just 30 years
 un par chah bacchon ke paalan poshan kaa puri jimmedaari aa gai
 All the struggle and struggle of life always kept him away from studies
 badhati umr main wo apana sapana kahin dabaae hue baithi thim
 At this age, when all the responsibilities were fulfilled and he got a chance to study, he gave his full strength
 phir, unhone kollam sthit apane ghar main chauthi kaksha ke samatuly pariksha di or umr ke kaaran shiksha se duuri banane vaale lakholakh logon ke liye misaal ban gayi
 According to the PTI report, PS Srikala, director of the literacy mission, said that Bhagirathi Amma has become the eldest 'equivalent educator' in the history of Kerala literacy mission so far

 ammaa jab 9 saal kii thim to vah teesri kaksha main padhati thim or iske baad padhai chhod di thi
 Amma, who has studied so hard and diligently, does not have an Aadhaar card, so she receives neither widow pension nor old age pension

 Earlier there has been a dispute over the installation of the idol

 There was a lot of controversy over the statue of Ashoka on the head of the national emblem

 At that time it was also not known from which department the statue was finally installed
 baad main jab lokabhawan banaaya gaya to pratimaa ke chabutare ko badal diya gaya jisamen ashok kii laat bani hui thi jisase vivaad shant ho sake
 Therefore, to avoid controversy this time, the administration wants to fix all the things in advance so that there is no dispute of any kind in the statue of Swami Vivekananda

 There is a popular saying among tax-gatherers that you do not pay tax, they collect tax
 tex ko pasand bhi koun karata he? lekin tex hi vah pahalu he jiske chalate bajet naam kii kavayad ek badi aabaadi ke liye dilachasp ho jaati he
 Apart from this, whatever happens in the budget does not affect the lives of half of the people of India
 modi sarkaar ke pehle vaastavik bajet (july kaa bajet sirf aath maah kaa tha) kaa intjaar bhale hi badi skiimon va sudhaaron ke liye kiya ja rahaa ho lekin bajet kii buniyaad, aarthik halaat or bhavishya kii taiyaariyaan bataati hai ki bajet kii asli ibaarat iske tex prastaavon main chhipi ho sakati he
 By tax, we do not mean income tax, which is the concern of only a handful of people
 ham to sabase bade tex parivaar kii baat kar rahe hai jo khapat va utpaadan par (exise, customs or sarvice tex) lagata he or sabko prabhavit karata he
 Taxes are bad, but the opportunity to introduce tax in the packaging of reform and protection is seldom seen, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley might not want to miss this opportunity
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jab mek in india kaa bigul bajaayaa tha tab unhen yah pataa nahin tha ki saste aayaat ke chalate bharat main utpaadan kis kadar gaiyr-pratispardhaatmak he
 It was only after two to three meetings on Make in India that the government became impossible to make manufacturing competitive without making imports expensive, as interest rates, land and electricity were cheap or labor laws were far away
 agar yah bajet mek in india ko hakeekat kii jameen dena chahega to tamaam utpaadon par custom duty main acchhee-khaasi badhotaree ho sakati he
 There are many imports at which the rate of customs duty is lower than the rates prescribed in the WTO, so the finance minister has options
 ve custom duty badhaakar swadeshi paraakaaron ko bhi khush karenge alabatta ayaatkon kii majboot lobby unhen rokane kii koshish karegi
 India's biggest tax reform will also not go up without increasing the tax rate
 jiesti kii taiyaariyaan shuru ho gai hai
 Combining the central and state tax structures, the GST rate in India can range from 25 to 30 percent
 jiesti ko yadi, agle saal amal main laana he to kendriya exise duty or sarvice tex kii daron main ek yaa do fisad (12 se 13 yaa 14) kii badhotaree kerani hogi taaki ekikrut tex pranali (jiesti) kii taraf badhane kaa rasta ban sake
 The Finance Minister would also like to use the opportunity to raise taxes on luxury products
 mahangaai kaabo main he, maang vaise bhi kam he isliye agar duty badhane se kuch chijen mahangi hoti hai to desi udyogon main nivesh va rojgaar badhane or jiesti laane kaa tark vitt mantri kii madad karegaa
 The far-reaching economic sense of the budget is also likely to come out of tax
 bharat main jidipi ke anupaat main tex sangrah kaa kam hona ek mahatvapurn pahalu he
 Weak tax GDP ratio indicates that the economy is growing but not tax collection
 bharat main yah anupaat do dashakon se 8 se 12 fisadi ke bich jhul rahaa he jo brazil, rus, dakshin africa jaise bricks deshon ke mukaable bhi kam he
 The Finance Minister will be seen trying to increase this ratio through changes in the tax structure, which is in line with the expectations of the global agencies
 bharat main sakal gharelu utpaadan (kheti, udyog, seva) kii gananaa kaa formula bhi badal gaya he
 The old calculation was based on the basic cost, which is the price the manufacturer or producer gets
 lekin ab utpaadan laagat kaa hisaab lagane main basic cost ke saath apratyaksh kar bhi shaamil hoga isliye kar badhaakar jidipi kii surat bhi chamakaayi ja sakati he
 India's budgets have always been full of spending
 sarkaar bhi yahi chaahati he ki bajet ko inakam tex riyaayaton ke jharokhe se dekha jaae, jo ek choti vetanjivi yaa udhyami aabaadi ke liye hoti hai yaa phir bajet main kharch ke aankadon par logon ko rijhaayaa jaae
 The government has good savings due to cheap crude oil and reduction in subsidies which is making room for spending
 yah kharch buniyadi dhaanche main hua to kuch asar karegaa lekin agar rajnatik chintaaen sir chadhakar boleen to kendriya skim raaj or sabsidi badhegi
 Well, it is better to look at spending not with the budget, but at the end of the year, because during the budget speech, big numbers are applauded and after six months, the Finance Minister Savit Bahadur after cutting expenses
 bharat kii tex niti nirnaayak mode par he
 Custom duty cuts, service tax and VAT in states were part of the first phase of tax reforms aimed at liberalizing the Indian market to the world and increasing the number of taxpayers
 kar sudhaaron kaa aglaa charan taxon kii sankhya simit karnaa, laagat ghataane va chori rokane par kendrit he taaki udyogon va vyapaar ko pratispardhaatmak banaaya ja sake
 This is the purpose of GST
 bajet main kharch ke aankade rajnatik hote hai jo bajet pesh hote hi hawa ho jate hai
 Jaitley's spending figures will also not be sustainable
 nigaah to unke tex prastaavon par hogi
 Taxes are eternal truths that make a presence felt throughout the year
 modi-jetali kii tex niti hi bharat main nivesh kaa bhavishya tay karegi

 In fact, Congress sources believe that according to its survey, the Congress alone is winning around 140 seats
 vahiin endie 180 ke andar simat jaaegi
 However, even after the exit poll results, the Congress is not ready to give more than 200 seats to the NDA
 congress kaa maananaa he ki bijepi ko urisa or bengal jaise rajyon main agsit pole jitani badhat bataa rahe hai, utani he nahin or jin rajyon main bijepi 2014 main sheersh par thi, vahaan ghaataa hona tay he
 Not only Congress, Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party have also rejected the exit poll results

 vaise tidipi netaa chandrababu naidu apana survey lekar sabase mulaakaat kar rahe hai, jisamen congress ko 129 or endie ko adhiktam 179 siten anumaanit hai
 Actually, on the results of the exit poll, the inner leader is telling 3 big things
 1
 Either the Modi government has made a big mess in evms or is about to do it, so the atmosphere is being prepared through exit poll
 2
 Either it is a game of making money through the stock market
 3
 Exit poll companies have been managed through money

 storehom uniwarsity ke shodhakartaonke mutabik ghar ke kaam main apane partner kaa saath dena aapke rishte par acha asar daalata he, jisase rishte main santushti or sthirataa aati he
 People who are very busy in household chores are unhappy and can breakup with their partner
 OMG
 
 
 All these women think while romancing
 
 
 yah dikhaata he ki apane partner se kitna pyaar karte hai aapshodhakartaaon ke anusaar pichley ek dashak main shaadi ke myne kaaphi badal gaye hai
 Now not only men in the family go to earn, but women are also working
 iske saath hi wo ghar kii jimmedaari bhi uthaa rahi hai or bacchon ko sambhaal rahi hai
 She feels tense while taking so many responsibilities, which increases the risk on her marriage
 isliye jaruri he ki unka partner ghar ke kaam main unki madad kare
 By doing this, you also show your love and care for your partner
 jo purush ghar ke kaam se bachate hai, unhen dhyaan rakhana chahie ki iskaa asar unke saathi par pad rahaa he

 "sanjay Baru writes that i believed that it is natural that a leader should either be praised or disgusted but should not be ridiculed
 sanjay baru ne likhaa ki jabamene 2008 main piemo choda, tab media unhen singh ij king kahati thi
 Four years later, a news magazine called it sing is sinning
 yah teji se girti chhavi kaa pramaan tha
 Sanjay Baru writes - He (manmohan) made many mistakes, he is not hesitant to mention it in this book
 pehle kaarykaal thik rahaa, magar doosraa kaarykaal vittiya ghotaalon or buree khabaron se bharaa rahaa
 He also lost control over politics

 Sanjay Baru has written that many questions were raised by journalists, diplomats, entrepreneurs, leaders and friends
 masalan, kya upie tu kii tulana main upie van zyada safal rahaa ?piem kii chhavi kyon kharaab hui he

 Sanjay Baru has written that he left the PMO for some personal reasons

 According to Sanjay Baru, there is no doubt that Manmohan Singh was the architect of victory in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 magar uski credit unhen nahin mili

 aisi charchaa bhi he ki karan is film main shahrukh khan or ranbir kapur ke apojit deepika padukon or katrina caff ko apni film main le sakate hai
 However, filmmaker Johar has not confirmed this yet
 ranbir or deepika ke brallep ke baad bhi donon ke achche relation hai
 Given this, Deepika has a good offer to work with

 Shah Rukh Khan has a good relationship with Deepika and Katrina, so if Shah Rukh and Ranbir say yes to this film, then Karan Joharki might face an ex boyfriend-girlfriend in this film
 liyakat ali naam ke shaks ko dilli police ne pakadaa, aatankwaadi banaaya or kahani garh di ki dilli dahalane vaali thi
 To prove the truth of the story, he even got himself armed with weapons and grenades and instead of supporting the truth, the Delhi Police Commissioner is also hitting the backs of his same soldiers
 kamaal he kamishnar sahab! kaash, apane police afasaron kii peeth thonkane or shaabaashi dene se pehle kam se kam ek baar liyakat ke maamle main daakhil enie kii chargeshit main unki karatuut hi pard late
 However, there is also no doubt that if the Delhiites sleep peacefully, then due to the Delhi Police
 dilli main bahut saare hamale tale to dilli police kii mustaidi ke kaaran hi, dilli kai baar dahalane se bachi to dilli police mehnat ke kaaran
 Speaking of the commissioner, Mr
 Sahab seems to have forgotten that the NIA has not pointed the finger at the Delhi Police
 balki usne to bas un 9 pulisavaalon kii gundai bataai he, jinhone sirf apni shoharat or shaan badhaane ke liye ek bekasoor ko aatankwaadi bana diya
 In order to intimidate Delhiites in the name of terrorist attack, he told his own informer to be a partner of terrorist and kept his arms in the guest house
 or kamishnar sahab inhen afasaron ke bare main kah rahe hai ki unke naam swarna aksharon main likhe jaaenge
 It is amazing commissioner
 dilli police kii special cell ko paidaa hi dilli ko aatankwaad se mukt rakhane ke liye kiya gaya tha
 Special cell officers have also done very successful operations, putting their lives at risk
 isi special cell ke inspector mohan chand sharma kii shahadat bhi dilli nahin bhuuli he, lekin kamishnar sahab aapako bhi pataa he ki isi special cell ke naa jane kitne afasaron kii vardi par kaise-kaise daag lage hai
 Still you are saying that he never implicated an innocent
 kamishnar sahab ek captain kaa ferj hota he apni team ko sanbhaalanaa
 Support them in difficult circumstances, not in the wrong things under difficult circumstances
 enie ne to sabir khan pathan naam ke us shaks kii puri kundali hi khangaal lee he or pataa chalaa ki vah aapke un jaanbaaj afasaron kaa munhalaga mubir he
 And your policemen knew that he was a partner of terrorist Liaquat Shah
 ab sawaal ye he ki wo police kaa mubir he to phir us guest house main hathiyaar rakhane kiske kehane par gaya? ise eke 56 rifl or grenade kisne die? ye kareeb das saal se aapaki special cell ke lodhi colony ke daftar main kyon padaa rahata he? iskaa sim card special cell ke daftar ke pate par kaise registerd he? kya ye sab liyakat ali shah ko fansaane ke liye nahin kiya gaya tha?apane andaaj main khabaren li karne main maahir special cell ne is baar jo khabaren li kii he, uske mutabik aapkaa pehla hathiyaar to jammu kashmir ke diji kaa wo khat he jisamen unhone liyakat kii patni kii ore se die gaye sarender kii arji ko kathith taur par 2012 main khaarij ho jane kaa zikr kiya tha
 Because he was an active terrorist even before his arrest
 par sawaal ye uthta he ki agar aisa tha to saalon se uske khilaaf puure hindustan main ek bhi report darj kyon nahin hui? agar wo hashatgardi main shaamil hi tha, to phir tamaam agenciyon ko liyakat ke khilaaf report likhane se kisne roka? sawaal ye bhi he ki agar aapaki daleel sahi he, to phir us vakt khud jammu kashmir ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla or vahaan kii police aapaki giraftaar ko galat kyon bataa rahi thi?aapane liyakat kii bivi ameena ke phone ko servilans par lagaaya hua tha or lambey samay tak ye sunate rahe ki wo kis tarah dehshatgardon ko suchanaaen de rahi thi
 Then the question arises that instead of arresting Amina, why did your police catch her husband? According to reports from the cell, Liaquat himself was talking to the Hizbul militants on number 17
 lekin kya cell ke paas aisa koi intercept he jisase ye sabit ho ki ye baatcheet holi par hamale ke liye ho rahi thi? or agar intercept tha, to phir cell ko apane mubir sabir khan pathan ko jhuthe subut ke liye seen main laane kii kya jarurat padi? ek daleel aapaki police khud ke maahir hone kii bhi de rahi he
 They are saying that if they were doing something wrong then why would they use their phone? So, sir, let me remind you how many such stories have come to the fore when the people involved in the crime have drowned their overconfidence
 chaliye ek baar ke liye bhi ye bhi maan lete hai ki aapaki kahi gai ye sabhi daleelein sahi hai, to phir sawaal ye uthta he ki aapkaa mubir sabir khan pathan haji araafaat guest house main hathiyaar plant karne kyon gaya tha? wo pathan jo special cell ke daftar main hi rah rahaa tha? sawaal ye bhi he ki uske paas eke 56 se prohibited bor ke hathiyaar or gola-barood kahaan se aae?na jane enie kii wo koun si majaburi he ki wo sabakuch jaanate hue bhi special cell ke un afasaron ke khilaaf khul kar bolne ko raji nahin, jinhone kanoon kii chindiyaan bikher kar ek begunaah ko aatankwaadi bataaya or salaakhon ke peeche pahunchaa diya
 In the case of Liaquat Ali Shah, the charge sheet of the NIA exposes the misdeeds of the police officers, but the NIA has kept silence in the case against these officers
 agar enie kii tafteesh sahi he, agar dilli police ne liyakat ali shah ko aatankwaad ke maamle main jhootha fansaaya he
 If the Delhi Police has falsely planted arms to do this, then why are the Delhi Police officers not guilty in the eyes of the NIA? That is the biggest question with the NIA charge sheet in the case of Liaquat Ali Shah Who is blazing in everyone's mind
 kyonki enie ne apni chargeshit main dilli police ke special cell kii pole to kholi he, lekin sabakuch hone ke baavjood usne in afasaron ko naa to mulgim qaraar diya he or naa hi adaalat se unke khilaaf aapraadhik mukadmaa darj karne kii maang kii he
 Rather she wants the court to take necessary action by filing a case against the guilty police on the basis of the charge sheet itself, just like the Aarushi murder case
 aise main sawaal vahi he aakhir kyon? kyon eie sidhe karrwai kii vakaalat se batch rahi he?khud enie kii tafteesh hi ye bataati he ki liyakat ko fansaane ke liye cell ne naa sirf juthi kahani gadhi, balki apane ek mubir ke zarie puraani dilli ke ek guest house main eke 56 jaisaa hathiyaar or gola barood bhi plant karvaa die
 If this story is true, then all these officers should be booked under crimes like Rongful Confinement, Defamation, Rongful Arrest, Demage and assault
 jisamen kam se kam 7 saal kii sajaa he
 Similarly, in the crime of planting AK 56 and ammunition, a lawsuit is made against SAIL informer Sabir Pathan as well as officers under the Arms Act
 jisamen kam se kam teen saal kii sajaa he
 But the NIA has not made any such demand
 sawaal vahi he aakhir kyon?akhir kyon enie cell ke afasaron ko kanoon todate hue paane ke baavjood unke khilaaf kanoonee karrwai ke badale sirf grih mantralay se vibhageeya karrwai kii maang kar rahi he
 Liaqat Ali Shah and his family members, who have breathed in the open air due to the investigation of the NIA, have now breathed a sigh of relief
 vajah ye ki enie kii chargeshit main naa sirf shah ko begunaah bataaya gaya he, balki us par se mukadmaa hataane kii bhi maang kii gai he
 But Liaquat and his family, who had lost a lot due to special cell design, now want action against Delhi Police
 cell ke hawa-hawaii maamle main giraftaar hone ke baad liyakat ko jamaanat to khayr pehle hi mil chuki thi
 But the nia's charge sheet in this case brought happiness to the Shah and his entire family
 kyonki is chargeshit main enie ne naa sirf shah ko begunaah bataaya, balki adaalat se uske khilaaf maamla khatm karne kii bhi guzarish bhi kii he
 Now that Shah's family members are happy because he got a clean chit, he is also demanding action against the Delhi Police officers who wrongly arrested Shah
 kanoon ke shikanje se bachane ke baad shah ke parivaar main khushi to he, lekin dushwariyaan bhi kam nahin he
 He says that he was already very poor
 upar se is mukademe kii vajah se unke paas jo bhi jameen jaaydaad thi, wo sab bik gaya
 In such a situation, the problem of passing them is also big

 Despite this, there is a stubborn attitude towards singing Vande Mataram
 kuch logon ko to raashtragan ke dauraan khadey hone ko lekar bhi dikkat he
 The editorial has written that if these others are not standing and insulting the national anthem, then the RSS chief should give directions to the pro-hindutva government on what action should be taken against such people
 shivasena kaa kahana he ki bhagwat ke bayaan ko bhi nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa jisamen unhone kathith taur par kaha tha koi netaa yaa party desh ko mahaan nahin bana sakate

 pradhanmantri ne is khabar par koi thos pratikriya nahin jaahir kii, lekin unke kareebi sahyogiyon main rahul gandhi ke bayaan se niraashaa chaa gai thi
 The stern response from the Congress vice-president has raised many questions: Is this the demand for democracy? Was it right to do this at a time when the Prime Minister is out of the country? Does the Congress Vice President have the right to veto the decision of the Union Cabinet? The Congress Vice President has the right to veto the decision of the Union Cabinet? Similarly, has the Prime Minister followed the constitutional process in the decision of the Central Government by surrendering to Rahul Gandhi's order and overturning the decision of the cabinet and retaining the supremacy of the cabinet? On the question of preventing the guilty leaders from contesting elections By favoring the popular mood, Rahul may have taken a bit of a moral edge, but in a single stroke, he made the Prime Minister's world Reliability and great damage to their status

 maanavadhikaron kii sherni apane kattar vaicharik shatru narendra modi ke bajaae apane hi najdiki saathiyon se ladaai main ulajh gai he
 Teesta Setalvad, known for calling the Chief Minister of Gujarat a father of an ugly communal divide over the 2002 riots issue, is now finding herself in her own trap
 unke hi ek saathi rahe tathaa unke maanavadhikaar sanghathan citigens for justise and pis (sijepi) ke samanvayak rahe rais khan ne un par apane swaarth kii khatir 2002 ke dangon ke muslim gavaahon ko pattee padhaane ke aarope lagaae hai
 The struggle involving Setalvad, responsible for canceling Modi's visa to America and Britain from his campaign, took a sharp turn when Khan, a resident of Ahmedabad, vowed to expose Setalvad by presenting such documentary evidence
 In each of the eight major cases of the Gujarat riots, how each prominent Muslim witness was convicted of perjury and rape for the sake of trapping important people
 5,000 for making a charges against the person
 pratimah kaa bhugtan kiya ja rahaa he
 "many Muslim witnesses in these cases get monthly payments through Setalvad hawala," says Khan
 main bhi gumraah ho gaya tha kyonki yah sara kaam peedit musalamaanon ko nyaay dilaane ke naam par jaij tehraaya ja rahaa tha
 If there is a detailed and impartial investigation into the matter including their source of money, then my point will be proved right
 '' sitalwar ke samarthak or dange ke ek maamle main gavaah nanumiyaan malik jawaab dete hai, ''khan unheen logon kaa agent he, jinase ham lard rahe hai
 His allegations are completely baseless
 ''bataate hai ki sitalwar ne malik se adaalat main yah aarope lagavakar khan ko fansaane kii koshish kii thi ki hindu hamalaavaron dwaara muslim mahilaon se balaatkaar sahit tamaam jhuthe aarope lagane vaale pehle se taiyaar shapath patron par muslim gavaahon ke hastakshar karwaane or is prakaar unke naam se adaalat main juthi gavaahi dene kaa kaam sitalwad ne nahin, khan ne kiya tha
 But Khan, who broke up with Setalvad in 2008, countered that Setalvad would send him a pre-prepared affidavit from Mumbai by e-mail, asking them to sign Muslim witnesses before presenting them in court
 sitalwar kii bhoomika jaanch ke daayre main is varsh ke shuru main ai, jab india today kii ek padtaal se sabit hua ki 2003 main supreme court ke saamne apane shapath patron main balaatkaar or anya gambhir kism ke aarope lagane vaale kai gavaahon ko yah pataa tak nahin he ki unhone apane shapath patron main kya aarope lagaae hai
 The Supreme Court had stayed the hearing of 9 cases of 2002 Gujarat riots on the basis of these affidavits
 ye gavaah isliye andhere main the ki shapath patr angreji main the, or unhen angreji nahin aati thi
 He had signed him on the assurance of the CJP
 sijepi kii sandigdh bhoomika is varsh ke shuru main supreme court kii ore se niyukt vishesh jaanch dal (esaity) kii jaanch se ujagar hui
 Initially 20 witnesses appeared before the SIT with a prepared statement, which did not accept them and asked them to write to the police what they had to say under Section 162 of crpc
 esaity ne unke bayaan darj karnaa shuru kiya to paaya ki 2002 main police ko die gaye unke bayaan or ab ke bayanon main baari antar he
 In a statement to SIT, more than a dozen witnesses flatly denied what they said in their 2003 affidavits
 sijepi kaa baar-baar doharaaya yah aarope bhi ki ek muslim mahila kausarbanu kaa bhrun dangaiyon ne chirakar nikaal diya tha, galat sabit hua
 By the way, the cjp's splash came in 2006, when the Gujarat government accused the human rights organization of tampering with evidence with implicit intentions and instigating Muslim riot victims in 2002 Pandarwad massacre and also presented concrete evidence
 godhra ke baad panchmahal jile ke panderwad gaanv main 20 se zyada muslim maar die gaye the
 In this case, relatives of the victims had dug up the skeletons of the dead at the instigation of the CJP and removed the skeletons, alleging that local officials of the Narendra Modi government had buried these people without telling the relatives
 tab sitalwar ne aarope lagaaya tha, ''yah sabit karne ke liye saboot maujuud hai ki adhikariyon ne hatyaon par paradaa daalane kii koshish kii thi
 When the Modi government presented all the evidence before the court after registering criminal charges against the CJP, the charge proved to be false
 bakaul khan, ''sijepi ne hameshaa donon samudaayon main faasla badhaane kii koshish kii
 My proposal to organize communal harmony program by bringing Hindus and Muslims on public platform was turned down in CJP
 '' sitalwar ke samarthak iskaa joardaar khandan karte hai
 On the other hand, due to being very close, Khan knows many secrets of Setalvad
 inamen kuch us kathith bhugtan kii raseeden hai, jo sijepi ne muslim gavaahon ko kiya tha, jo vah apane paas hone kaa daawa karata he
 According to him, he has illustrated evidence of how Setalvad had unsuccessfully tried to get BJP leader Vitthalbhai Pandya, who has been murdered, into his court
 pandya ke pita modi ke khilaaf abhiyaan chede hue the or khan ke mutabik, sitalwad kii koshish thi ki ve 2002 ke dangon ke silsile main narendra modi, unke samarthakon or unki naukarshahi ke khilaaf koi bada maamla darj karaaen
 When Pandya's father did not agree to it, Setalvad favored Zakia Jafri, widow of Congress leader Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the 2002 riots
 jaahir he, khan ke paas kahin zyada gambhir sijepi virdohi masala he, jis par ve abhi chup hai
 When Setalvad is embroiled with a former colleague, the Gujarat Chief Minister is extremely proud of his vision of a national role in Delhi in the coming years
 isaki vajah he
 Setalvad's role in creating Modi's image as a communal divider was the highest, and thus he created a major obstacle in Modi's political path
 lekin ab jab khud unka pardaafash ho gaya he or ve adaalaton ko gumraah karne ke aaropon kaa saamana kar rahi hai, to modi kii raah apane aap aasaan ho jaati he

 It was the last week of November last year when the Prime Minister flagged off the train between Guwahati and Mendipathar (meghalaya), saying, “railway facilities look 100 years old
 railway steshnon kaa nijeekaran kiijie
 Make them modern
 stesan airport se achche hone chahie
 Railways should invite private sector to build luxury hotels on their land
 ” railway ko samajhane vaale maanenge ki yah badi baat thi
 For the first time an Indian Prime Minister was showing courage in discussing the privatization of railways
 lekin thik ek maah ke bheetar sab kuch badal gaya
 After reaching the diesel engine factory in Varanasi, the Prime Minister said, "rumors are being spread about the privatization of railways, i have never thought of it or i ever will
" ” railway ko badalane par you turn na keval kathor sudhaaron ko lekar modi sarkaar ke sankalp main kamajori kaa pehla elaan tha, balki isse ek vishaal aabaadi kii ummiden bhi murjhaa gayi jiske paas parivahan ke liye railway ke alaava koi vikalp nahin he or jise bullate train kaa sapana dikhaaya gaya tha
 It was not known that soon after coming to power, the Modi government, which is bugging the foreign investment in the railways, would be so subdued in a few months that it would be too scared to talk about the reorganization of the railway
 sarkaar ab bhale hi railway ko ghistata hua banaae rakhane par mutmain ho lekin hakeekat yah he ki railway main sudhaar apekshaakrit aasaan he
 The railways have several blue prints of the improvements
 pichley do varsh main saat samitiyaan sudhaaron kii sifarish kar chuki hai
 The Bibek Debroy committee was formed by the Modi government itself, which was considered an ambitious initiative for reforms in railways
 lekin jab march main isaki antarim report ai tab tak railway ko badalane ke utsaah ko anjaanaa dar nigal chukaa tha, isliye cameti ne apni antim report main ekamusth sudhaaron kii sifarish ko naram kar diya he
 It is not difficult to form a political consensus on reforms in this giant transport company
 bhartiya rail main badlaav ke tark kisi aam aadmi ke bhi gale utar jaaenge, jo roj isamen dhakke khaataa he
 For example, which transport company in the world would run 125 hospitals, 586 dispensaries? Or who in the world would be running a railway degree college and school? Naturally, running a train is a railway job, not a school-hospital
 thik isi tarah duniya kii koi bas seva yaa air sarvice apane liye basen or vimaan nahin banaati hogi yaa sadaken or hawaii adde nahin chalaati hogi
 So when the Debroy committee recommended handing over the railway infrastructure to a separate company, combining the six units of the railway making coaches, engines and axle-wheels to form the Indian Railway Manufacturing Company and handing the schools over to the Kendriya Vidyalaya, the snake snuff Gone
 debaroy samiti ne railway ke punargathan ke liye britain, germany, sweden, australia ke model sujhaaye hai, jinka hawala modi ke sambodhano main miltaa he jab ve japan va china kii tarj par railway ko aadhunik banane kii baat karte the
 The foresight about the railways remained till the speeches
 iskaa bada pramaan dedicated fret coridor (diefasi) he, jo 2005 se lataka he
 This project was created to provide a high speed network to the freight transport in the railways
 iske shuru hone se vartmaan network yatri trainon ke liye khaali ho saktaa he
 dfc's 3,300 km West (haryana to Maharashtra) and East (punjab to West Bengal) corridors have been approved
 purvi coridor main patari bichaane ke liye tata or elandti ke netritv main do sanyukt upkram bhi ban chuke hai
 If the Modi government wanted to activate them, it could have made the railway the flag bearer of infrastructure and manufacturing (make in India)

 Indian Railways is currently running on loans from government insurance companies and everywhere from railways to passengers, the realization that fast reforms in the railways are far-fetched
 taaja halaat main railway main videshi nivesh aane kii ummid na ke baraabar he
 Foreign investment in non-transportation activities was allowed only in 2001 & the projects of locomotives in Mathura and Madhepura have been laying the carpet for foreign investors for seven years
 bhartiya rail kaa haal jaanane ke liye, is dahakati garmi main trainon main safar karne ke alaava doosraa rasta yah bhi he ki aap google kii madad se modi ke un bhaashanon ko padhein, jo chunaav se lekar satta main aane tak die gaye the
 These speeches are documentary evidence of climbing and collapsing at the peak of expectations of change in the country's largest transport system

 Modi then said that "we have a huge railway network, but unfortunately we did not pay attention to it
" agar railway aadhunik ho to ham vikaas ko nai gati de sakate hai
 "this was the first time that the biggest leader of a political party moving towards power was talking about reforms in railways

 'he said that a five-member group of emerging countries needed to' show leadership in the fight against terrorism '
 china ke state counslar yang yichi kii mejabani main ho rahi baithak main apane sankshipt bhaashan main dobhaal ne kaha ki bricks deshon ko kshetreey or vaishvik mahatv ke kootnithik muddon par netritv kii bhoomika nibhaani chahie, khaastaur se un kshetron main jahaan unki 'aam raay' he
 He made no mention of the Doklam standoff in his speech
 sikkim seemaa ke paas sthit doklam ko lekar jari gatirodh ke bich dobhaal ne isse pehle yahaan shuukravaar ko apane chini samakaksh yang jichi se mulaakaat kii
 Both are special representatives of the india-china border system
 china ne is mulaakaat ke baad kaha tha ki dobhaal or unke chini samakaksh yang jichi bricks NSA baithak se itar mili or dwipaksheeya sambandhon se judi 'pramukh samasyaon' par charchaa kii
 It is believed that in this meeting he discussed the deadlock between the armies of the two countries in Doklam area of sikkim region
 haalanki china ne doklam main jari tanatani kaa koi zikr nahin kiya
 At the same time, Chinese media has once again raised Doklamamudda during Doval's visit to China
 global times main likhaa gaya he ki china doklam ke mudde par kisi tarah kaa samjhauta nahin karegaa
 The article said that Ajit Doval's visit to China will not make much difference
 china apane rukh se bilkul bhi peeche nahin hatega
 China says that China still maintains its stand that India should first withdraw its army from Doklam, only then can there be any peace initiative
 iske saath hi china ne ek baar phir jammu-kashmir ke masale par adnga lagaaya he
 China has said that if India does not back down on the Doklam issue, then China will interfere in Jammu and Kashmir issue
 isse pehle bhi china ne kashmir ke masale main dakhal dene kii baat kahi thi
 China says that India is interfering in the issue of China and Bhutan as a third party, if this continues, then on the plea of pakistan, China will also intervene on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir
 china ne zikr kiya ki bhutan kii ore se bharat se koi madad nahin maangi gai thi, lekin bharat phir bhi is mudde main apana adnga laga rahaa he
 Explain that the military standoff in Sikkim region with China has been about a month

 On the other hand, as National Security Advisor, Doval has the right to take security decisions

 The oath taking ceremony was held in the capital Gandhinagar, where Vijay Rupani took the oath of Chief Minister and Nitin Patel as Deputy Chief Minister
 is shapath grahan samaaroh ke jariye bijepi ne apana shakti pradarshan bhi kiya
 Many Union ministers and senior party leaders including Prime Minister Narendra and BJP National President arrived to attend the program
 saath hi sadhu-sant or vibhinn dharmon ke netaa bhi yahaan aae
 Apart from all this, the Chief Ministers of 18 nda-ruled states also appeared on the stage
 manch par maujuud bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii tasviir sabase khaas rahi
 Actually, there is a big reason for this
 narendra modi or nitish kumaar endie ke wo do netaa hai, jinke rishton main aksar utaar-chadhaav dekhne ko mili hai
 In 2002, Gujarat gave away
 puure desh main ye dange na sirf charchaa kaa vishay bane, balki rajya kii tatkaaleen modi sarkaar par dange rokane main naakaami ke iljaam bhi lage
 When the train was set on fire in Godhra, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was in the center at the center and Nitish Kumar used to be the railway minister
 bataur pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ne gujarat sarkaar ko rajdharm nibhaane kii naseehat di or nitish kumaar jaanch ke liye khud gujarat gaye or apni report pesh kii
 After this it was also discussed that the Godhra case was an issue of law and order, which is a matter of state government
 endie kaa hissaa hone ke bajwood gujarat dangon ke baad nitish kumaar or narendra modi ke aapasi rishton par charchaa hone lagi
 In 2004, the Atal government went away and in 2005 Nitish Kumar returned to Bihar once again assuming the post of Chief Minister
 duusari taraf, 2002 se 2012 tak narendra modi lagaataar gujarat ke mukhyamantri banate rahe
 However, no such opportunity was seen when he visited the land of Gujarat and was seen together
 haalanki, gujarat ke baahar donon netaaon ne jarur ek saath manch saajha kiya, lekin us par bhi kaaphi khatas saamne ai
 One such picture surfaced from Ludhiana in May 2009, when TRS became part of the NDA
 is kaarykram main bijepi ke tamaam varisht netaaon samet endie shasit rajyon ke mukhyamantri bhi pahunche the
 Among them were Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar
 donon netaaon ne ek saath na sirf manch saajha kiya tha, balki ek-duusare kaa haath pakadakar manch se apane rishton main garmaahat dikhaane kii bhi koshish kii
 However, before this meeting, such a statement came from Nitish Kumar that he would not share the stage with Modi
 iske baad khabar ye bhi ai ki laalkrishna adwani ne arun jetali ke jariye nitish kumaar ko ludhiana aane kaa vishesh aagrah karaayaa
 However, when the two met on stage, Modi's hand appeared in the hand of Modi
 dinar party radd kiludhiana main modi ke saath manch saajha karne ke baad bhi nitish kumaar kii asahajata saamne ai
 When the BJP National Executive met in Patna in June 2010, there was a pattern of bitterness between the two leaders
 nitish kumaar ne bijepi netaaon ke liye prastaavit dinar party hi radd kar di
 The news came that Nitish Kumar was not happy with the advertisement of the Gujarat government to help the flood affected people in Bihar
 jiskaa asar ye hua ki nitish kumaar ne na sirf dinar cancel kar diya balki gujarat sarkaar dwaara baadh peediton ke liye bheji gai raashi bhi lautaa di
 Not only this, Nitish Kumar has been publicly criticizing publicity on the help of flood victims as the basis of humanitarianism
 yahaan tak ki bihar main narendra modi ko prachaar na karne dene kii bhi khub charchaa rahi
 After this, there was a lot of news about Nitish Kumar and Narendra Modi among the enthusiasts of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 ek taraf bijepi modi ke chehre par loksabhaa chunaav ladane kii yojana bana rahi thi, vahiin duusari taraf nitish kumaar se bhi piem pad kii daavedaari ke sawaal kiye ja rahe the
 Finally, in September 2013, BJP declared Narendra Modi as the Prime Ministerial candidate, but before that in June 2013, Nitish Kumar announced to break the alliance with BJP and ended his 17-year relationship with NDA
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main maat khaane ke baad nitish kumaar ne 'mahagathbandhan' kaa netritv karte hue 2015 vidhansabha chunaav main shandaar jeet darj kii
 The Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Congress were also included in the Grand Alliance
 lekin july 2017 main nitish ek baar lalu or congress ko chhodkar bijepi ke saath chale gaye
 However, before this, pictures of his distance from Modi and BJP started coming down
 prakaash parv ke maukey par piem modi patna gaye or yahaan nitish kumaar manch par unke saath thahaake lagaate dikhe
 But after 2002, the first such occasion came when Nitish Kumar went to Gujarat and shared the stage with Narendra Modi
 haryana congress ke purv adhyaksh ashok tanvar ne naaraaz hokar party se istipha de diya he
 He has alleged the purchase and sale of tickets being distributed for the assembly elections
 tanvar ne congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko bheje tyaagptr main aarope lagaaya ki party ko khatm karne kii sajeesh rachi ja rahi he
 After resigning, Ashok Tanwar held a press conference and attacked the leaders of the Congress fiercely, although he did not name anyone during this time, but which side was his attack, it is being discussed openly in the political corridors
 ashok tanvar ne samvaadadattaaon se kaha ki pichley 5 saalon se ham log khun paseene se haryana main congress ko majboot karne kii koshish main lage hue the
 But now we are ignored
 ashok tanvar ke mutabik party ke kuch netaaon kii raajnneetik hatya kar di gai jabaki kuch kii baaki he, unhone kaha ki jinaki hatya ho gai, unamem main (ashok tanvar) hum, sanjay nirupam hai or ajay kumaar hai
 It is to be noted that before the assembly elections in Maharashtra, Sanjay Nirupam has also expressed his displeasure and announced to keep himself away from the Congress campaign
 press conference main tanvar ne kaha ki congress ke andar kuch log congress mukt kar rahe hai
 According to Tanwar, some people sit in AC rooms for five years, live abroad and appear in elections but the deeds of such leaders are not demons but demonic ones
 tanvar ne kaha ki hamaare upar hamalaa tak kiya gaya, baavjood iske koi madad nahin mili
 He said in a terse tone that the results will come on October 24, in 20 days it will be known how big leaders some people are
 istipha dene ke baad dukhi najar aae tanvar ne aarope lagaae ki saadhaaran parivaar waalon ko mauka nahin miltaa he, jab miltaa he tab roj baadhaaen khadi ho jaati hai
 Tanwar told that he removed me but still hoped that those who worked hard for five years would be judged but it did not happen
 istipha dene kaa faisla do din pehle hi kar liya tha lekin khud ko roak liya tha
 On the rumor of going to other parties, Tanwar made it clear that i am not going anywhere, i have been invited from many parties from BJP but i have not gone anywhere
 aage ke kadam ke liye apane saathiyon ke saath vichaar kar jald hi faisla liya jayega
 Tanwar also referred to Rahul Gandhi during the press conference and said that the leaders whom Rahul ji pushed forward are being tried to kill him under the conspiracy
 phek news kii yah teesri kadi he
 The big challenge is how to find out whether there is fake news or not
 raajnneetik vichaardhaara se prerit ho kar kai website maujuud hai jo news sanghathan ke bhesh main aapke saath chal kar rahi hai
 There are many such websites in India, whose names have been named in such a way that it seems that there will be a news organization
 dikkat ye he ki inaki chori pakad lene ke baad bhi jo safai hoti he wo us jhooth kaa peechha nahin kar paati he jo bahut dur nikal chuki hoti he
 Fake news is particularly affecting the democratic process
 iske zariye kahin sampradayik tanaav paidaa kiya ja rahaa he to kahin kisi dal ke netaa ko lagaataar badnaam kiya jaataa rahata he
 Information is first sent in the form of news
 kai maheenon tak failaane ke baad usee soochna kaa chutkula banaakar phir se bheja jaataa he taaki aap baar baar dekhte rahe hai ki jawahar laal nehru kaa asli naam kya tha or ve kahaan se aate the
 On 15 May 2016, Amulya Gopalakrishnan of the Times of India published a report about the lies being spread to Nehru
 nehru bhi phek news waalon ke tantra se nahin batch sake
 Jawahar is the name of an Arabic word, no Kashmiri Brahmin can bear the Arabic name of his child
 nehru ke dada giasuddin gaazi the, mughalon ke kotwaal the jinhone apana naam gangadhar nehru rakh liya
 Nehru was born in Vorotoli, Allahabad
 nehru ne ek catholic nan ko garbhvatee kar diya tha, carch ne us nan ko bharat se baahar bhej diya jiske liye nehru aaajeevan carch ke abhaari rahe
 First of all, ask yourself this question whether you have ever seen such fake information related to Nehru on whatsapp or Internet
 is vakt jab bharat main 16wein pradhanmantri ke rup main narendra modi kaa shashan chal rahaa he tab kisi ko pehle pradhanmantri kii vanshavali yaa unhen mogul bataane main kya dilchaspee ho sakati thi
 An entire political system was employed to spread such things about Nehru
 saal bhar se zyaada samay se chal rahaa tha lekin jab amoolya ne in tathyon kii jaanch kii tab kuch logon tak yah baat pahunchi kyonki tab tak phek news ke giroh se ladane vaala altnews
 did not come in you tub par bhi nehru ko lekar kai tarah ke video banaaye gaye hai jinamein phek tathyon kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 There is a reference to a video whose title is the best man in India
 jise 40 lakh logon ne dekha tha
 The aim is to keep Nehru's credibility going
 nehru ko lagaataar badnaam kiya ja rahaa he
 Nehru is not in the world
 isliye 2019 main unke pradhanmantri kaa chunaav ummidavaar banane kii koi sambhaavna bhi nahin he phir ek raajnneetik tantra kyon nehru ko badnaam karata ja rahaa he
 Such misinformation about Nehru was introduced in the form of news so that millions of people could see it and the hatred towards Nehru continued to spread
 inamen se adhikansh phek news tha
 The motive was to convert Nehru from a Kashmiri Brahmin to a Muslim
 ayyash bataa do
 a video states that Nehru died of AIDS
 jacleen kennedy or mrinalini sarabhai kii tasviren lagaakar nehru ko ayyash dikhaaya gaya
 Photoshop was used
 vikipedia main nehru or unke pita motilaal nehru ko lekar jaankariyaan badal di gayi
 The Times of India, quoting Pranesh Prakash of the Center for Internet and Society, wrote that the change was done with the government's IP address
 24 janvari 2016 kii scrol dot in kii ek khabar he
 When Netaji's papers were made public, nothing special came out of them, but quoting Nehru's fake letters, he started distributing them through whatsapp, in which the journalists came under the scanner
 jab pataa chalaa to sabane dilit karnaa shuru kar diya or maafee maangani shuru kar di
 Whereas there was no such letter
 phek news kaa ek rup yah bhi he
 In today's time, give you fake news and also throw away the facts of history
 sochiye is tarah se aap na to aaj ke bare main sahi jaan paayenge, or na beete hue kal ke bare main
 Fake information about Nehru is being filled on the Internet
 aapkaa baccha skool college ke project ke liye jab downlod karegaa to galat jaankariyaan likh aayega
 It is possible that a teacher inspired by political ideology will give him the number on the same information and he will live his whole life in the belief that what he knows was right while he was fake
 phek news or phek video ke kaaran kai jagah sampradayik hinsa hui he, hatya hui he or sampattiyon ko nuksaan bhi pahunchaa he
 But through this fake news, an attempt was made to erase the information related to the biggest violence in history
 aapane pichley hafte hi dekha tha ki pradhanmantri modi isroyal daure par holocost memorial gaye the
 Where he told a cruel chapter of history
 lekin gardian akhbaar kii carol cadwolder ne notice kiya ki google ke search main yah daalane par ki Did the Holocaust really happen? to jawaab aata he ki holocost hua hi nahin tha or search riselt ek nav naatzi website stormfront
 takes us to the org where such things are written that the top ten reasons why the Holocaust had not happened
 11 disambar 2016 ke apane lekh main carol ne is par vistaar se baat kii he jo gardian akhbaar main chapa he
 He has told that there are many such videos on youtube
 jabaki kitabon or aitihaasik dastavezon main yah baat darz he ki hitler ne saath lakh logon ko marava diya tha
 When Carroll raised this question, Google made improvements after that, but imagine how many such historical evidence on the Internet would have been changed
 usee tarah jaise sarkarein itihaas kii kitabon ko badal detii hai
 You think that this is not an important question for you and your child
 kya aapa itane samajhadaar mata pita hai jo apane bacchon ko phek news or phek history kii viraasat khushi khushi dena chahta he
 We will also try to talk about the algorithm in the Fake News series, through which all these facts are changed to the top of Google search
 aap whatsap nehru or holocost ke bare main phek history pard rahe hai, aapkaa baccha bhi jab vahi phek jaankaree lekar aayega to ho saktaa he ki aap kah den ki vaah kitna samajhadaar ho gaya he
 i also know what i know
 lakhon log is tarah kii phek history, phek news share kar rahe hai
 Last year, a website called Buzzfeed made a list of 5 big fake news which is as follows
 - obama ne desh ke sabhi skulon main nishtha kii shapath lene par roak lagane ke aadesh de diye hai
 It has been shared 21 million times on Facebook
 - pope francis ne donald trump kii ummidavaari kaa samarthan kiya, ise 9 lakh baar share kiya gaya
 There is another interesting fact
 amareeki akhbaar The Sun Chronicle ke Tom Reilly ne 29 june, 2017 ko apane ek sampadakeey main likhaa ki associadet press jaisi badi sanstha bhi phek news kaa shikaar hui he
 While the institution is 171 years old, the story of 1700 newspapers, 5000 TV and radio broadcast aps around the world is published
 to sochiye kahaan kahaan phek news pahunch jaataa hoga
 This is the condition of the organization which has 243 news bureaus in 120 countries
 bharat ke aath das tivi channel mila denge to bhi itane reporter nahin honge
 The Associated Press has admitted that it had some news which was not news
 isliye api ne ek nayaa news feechar shuru kiya he Not Real News
 Under this, such fake news will be exposed which went viral on Twitter or other platforms
 phir bhi yah kaam ye bhi kisi badi jhil ko chalni se saafe karne jaisaa he
 Fake news is a broad category
 isaki kai upashakhaayen hai
 There is a branch of fake pictures
 kai netaaon ke twit se lekar sarkaar kii report tak main phek tasviren pahunch jaati hai or vahaan se aap logon ke bich ki vaah dekho kya nazaaraa he
 Recently, on the page number 40 of the 2016-17 Annual Report of the Home Ministry of India, it was informed that there is an international border, it has been approved to arrange 2043 km of bright light there, only 100 km is left
 has gone
 baaki ho gaya he
 To show this, a picture was put in the report of the Ministry of Home Affairs, below which is written the arrangement of fast light at the border
 jise aap dekhakar samajhenge ki vaah ye to kamaal hi ho gaya
 But when altnews on 14 June
 in ne is tasviir ko jhooth bataate hue report chhaapi to sab hairaan rah gaye
 After all, how can a fake picture go in the report of the Home Ministry? ai kahaan se
 Was this report made by searching Google? altnews ne bataaya ki yah tasviir spain morocco seemaa kii he
 It is a matter of fact that the Home Secretary of the Home Ministry did not delay at all
 hamaari sahyogi nita sharma ne report kii ki grihasachiv ne report kii taiyaari se jude adhikariyon se safai maangi to pataa chalaa ki biguef se ye tasviir ai thi
 The Home Secretary expressed regret for this and the picture has been removed from the online version of the annual report
 magar teen maheene se yah tasviir maujuud thi
 Know where you must have reached
 agar alt news ne apni report main bataaya he ki hindutwa
 The information started to be promoted as an achievement of the government
 likhaa gaya ki bharat-paak or bharat-bangladesh seemaa ko puri tarah se sil karne kaa kaam bhi jor se chalaa hua he or jald hi simaaen pehle kii apeksha kaaphi zyaada surakshit ho jaaengi
 Seeing a working government do this makes one feel quite good
 
 
 yahi nahin, bijepi ke saansad paresh rawal ke do twit kii charchaa karne ja rahaa hum
 The first tweet is on July 3
 saansad paresh rawal ne purv raashtrapati e pi je abdul kalam kaa ek bayaan twitor handle par share kar diya
 Wrote that this pseudo is for the Liberal people
 baad main pataa chalaa ki wo bayaan kalam kaa tha hi nahin
 "it was written in this statement that i tried to reconcile Pakistan by citing Islam but i did not betray the motherland
 " jab hangaamaa hua to paresh rawal ne kaha ki mujhe pataa nahin tha ki yah phek he
 If there was someone else in their place, i would have checked it twice, but because of Kalam i felt it right
 yah bilkul mumkin he ki aisa hua he or aisa ho jaataa he
 Anyone gets caught in such pictures and statements
 lekin jab unhone mashhoor lekhika arundhati roy ko lekar ek twit kiya to uske kai khataranaak pahalu saamne aa gaye
 On 17 May 2017, Paresh Rawal tweeted that Arundhati Roy has given an interview that 70 lakh Indian Army cannot defeat the Azadi Gang of Kashmir
 isi ke saath unhone arundhati roy kii tasviir laga di jisamen wo sena kii jeep ke aage bithai gayi hai
 Many big news channels got debated about this
 bahes kaa tevar aisa tha ki arundhati roy ke khilaaf bheed aakraamak ho sakati thi
 While Arundhati Roy neither went to Srinagar recently nor gave any such interview to anyone
 arundhati raay ne ek saal pehle outluk patrika ko zarur intervyuu diya tha magar paresh rawal kaa twit us intervyuu ko lekar nahin tha
 Thewire on 24 May
 in ne jab yah pataa lagaaya ki paresh rawal tak jaankaree kaise pahunchi to phek news kaa ek or khataranaak pahalu saamne aa gaya
 The comments paresh rawal ne arundhati roy kaa yah phek intervyuu The Nationalist naam ke fasebuk pej se uthaakar twit kar diya
 The postcard reached the news on this page
 news se, is website kii kai khabaren phek news ke silsile main vivaadit ho chuki hai
 It was written on this that Arundhati Roy gave this interview to The Times of Islamabad that 70 lakh Indian Army cannot defeat the Azadi Gang of Kashmir
 postcardenus ne apana sorce nahin bataaya lekin vir ne paaya ki radio pakistan ne sabas pehle yah prasaarit kiya tha
 The Times of Islamabad, which is being described as a Pakistani newspaper, is a website, not a newspaper

 com ne bhi chapa or chaar paanch website ne bhi ise apane yahaan jagah di
 All these names have also come in connection with Fake News
 thewire
 in caught that internethindu
 in ne apni story main Times of Islamabad kaa link diya tha
 You see how the fake news fake interview going through the Pakistani site reaches the Twitter handle of the MP of India and from there a fierce debate is started against Arundhati Roy on the channels of India
 paresh rawal ne twit dilit kar diya lekin aaj bhi yah phek intervyuu radio pakistan kii website or bharat ke post card
 News is on the picture
 yah bhi ek ranneeti he
 When the controversy stops, this fake interview will start to be revived
 yaa kya pataa whatsap uniwarsity main ghumaya hi ja rahaa ho
 Think about what a dangerous aspect this is
 phek news ke maamle main bharat or pakistan kii website bhi ek duusare kii madad kar sakati hai
 Someone will get a fake interview printed in Pakistan in your name, by the time you give cleanliness, TV channels, politicians and these websites together will have done you a terrible loss
 abhi to iske zariye awaz uthaane waalon ko daraaya ja rahaa he, kamazor or darpok vipaksh ko daraaya ja rahaa he lekin jaldi hi is khel ke zariye aap logon ko bhi fiks kiya jane lagegaa
 It is also being done
 pehle to yah sawaal aap khud se puuchhiye ki kya aapane kabhi whatsap yaa internet par nehru se sambandhit is tarah kii phek jaankaree dekhi he
 At the moment when Narendra Modi is ruling as the 16th Prime Minister in India, what could have interested anyone in the lineage of the first Prime Minister or to call him Mughal
 ek puraa raajnneetik tantra laga rahaa nehru ke bare main is tarah kii baton ko failaane main
 It had been going on for more than a year but when Amulya investigated these facts, it reached some people because by then altnews fighting the fake news gang
 in nahin aayaa tha
 Many videos have been made on youtube on Nehru, in which fake facts have been used
 ek video kaa zikr he jiskaa tital he hindustan kaa sabase ayyash aadmi
 Which was seen by 4 million people
 makasad he ki nehru kii saakh ko khatm karte rahaa jaae
 Nehru is constantly being maligned
 nehru duniya main nahin hai
 So there is no possibility of him becoming the Prime Ministerial election candidate in 2019, then why a political system continues to malign Nehru
 nehru ke bare main aisi galat soochnaaon ko news kii shakl main pesh kiya gaya taaki lakhon log dekh saken or nehru ke prati ghrinaa failati rahe
 Most of this was fake news
 makasad tha ki nehru ko kashmiri brahman se musalmaan bana do
 Tell me ek video main bataaya gaya he ki nehru kii maut aids se hui thi
 Nehru was depicted with pictures of Jacqueline Kennedy and Mrinalini Sarabhai
 photoshop kaa istemaal hua
 In Wikipedia, information about Nehru and his father Motilal Nehru was changed

 ek kaam karne vaali sarkaar ko aisa karte dekhte hue kaaphi acha ahsaas hota he
 
 
 Not only this, i am going to discuss two tweets of BJP MP Paresh Rawal
 pehla twit 3 july kaa he
 MP Paresh Rawal shared a statement of former President APJ Abdul Kalam on the Twitter handle
 likhaa ki ye chhadam libral logon ke liye he
 Later it was discovered that that statement was not from Kalam
 "is bayaan main likhaa tha ki mujhe pakistan ne islam kaa hawala dekar milaane kaa prayaas kiya lekin maine mathrubhumi ke saath gaddari nahin kii
 "when there was an uproar, Paresh Rawal said that i did not know it was fake
 agar inaki jagah koi or hota to main ise do baar check karata magar kalam kii vajah se mujhe yah sahi laga
 It is quite possible that this has happened and it happens
 koi bhi aisi tasveeron or bayanon ke jhaanse main aa jaataa he
 But when he made a tweet about famous writer Arundhati Roy, many dangerous aspects came out of it
 17 may 2017 ko paresh rawal ne twit kiya ki arundhati roy ne intervyuu diya he ki 70 lakh bhartiya sena kashmir ke azaadi gang ko haraa nahin sakati
 With this, he put a picture of Arundhati Roy, in which she is placed in front of the army jeep
 ise lekar kai bade news channelon par baqayda bahes ho gai
 The debate was such that the crowd could be aggressive against Arundhati Roy
 jabaki arundhati raay na to haal main srinagar gayi thim or na hi aisa koi intervyuu kisi ko diya tha
 Arundhati Roy did give an interview to Outlook magazine a year ago, but Paresh Rawal's tweet was not about that interview
 24 may ko thewire
 in When it came to know how information reached Paresh Rawal, another dangerous aspect of fake news came to light
 tippaniyan Paresh Rawal tweeted this fake interview of Arundhati Roy from the Facebook page named The Nationalist
 is pej par khabar pahunchi postcard
 From the news, many news of this website has been disputed in relation to fake news
 is par likhaa tha ki arundhati roy ne yah intervyuu The Times of Islamabad ko diya he ki 70 lakh bhartiya sena kashmir ke azaadi gang ko haraa nahin sakati hai
 postcardnews did not reveal its source but The Wire found that Radio Pakistan had aired it all before
 jis The Times of Islamabad ko pakistani akhbaar bataaya ja rahaa he, wo website he, akhbaar nahin he
 postcard
 news ne jis din ye phek intervyuu chapa tha usee din ise satyavijayi
 com also published and four five websites also gave it their place
 in sabhi kaa naam bhi phek news ke silsile main aa chukaa he
 thewire
 in pakadaa ki internethindu
 in gave a link to the Times of Islamabad in his story
 aap dekhiye ki kis tarah pakistani site se chalate hue phek news phek intervyuu bharat ke saansad ke twitor handle par pahunchataa he or vahaan se bharat ke channelon par arundhati roy ke kilaaf zordaar bahes chhid jaati he
 Paresh Rawal deleted the tweet but even today this fake interview radio pakistan website and post card of India
 news par tasviir ke saath he
 It is also a strategy
 jab vivaad tham jayega to phir se is phek intervyuu ko ghumaya jane lagegaa
 Or what the address is being rotated in whatsapp University
 aap sochiye yah kitna khataranaak pahalu he
 India and Pakistan websites can also help each other in the case of fake news
 koi aapke naam se pakistan main phek intervyuu chhapava de, jab tak aap safai denge, tivi channel, netaa or ye website milakar aapkaa bhayankar nuksaan kar chuke honge
 Right now, those who raise their voice are being intimidated, weak and timid opposition is being intimidated, but soon you will also be fixed through this game
 balki kiya bhi ja rahaa he

 MP Paresh Rawal shared a statement of former President APJ Abdul Kalam on the Twitter handle
 likhaa ki ye chhadam libral logon ke liye he
 Later it was discovered that that statement was not from Kalam
 "is bayaan main likhaa tha ki mujhe pakistan ne islam kaa hawala dekar milaane kaa prayaas kiya lekin maine mathrubhumi ke saath gaddari nahin kii
 "when there was an uproar, Paresh Rawal said that i did not know it was fake
 agar inaki jagah koi or hota to main ise do baar check karata magar kalam kii vajah se mujhe yah sahi laga
 It is quite possible that this has happened and it happens
 koi bhi aisi tasveeron or bayanon ke jhaanse main aa jaataa he
 But when he made a tweet about famous writer Arundhati Roy, many dangerous aspects came out of it
 17 may 2017 ko paresh rawal ne twit kiya ki arundhati roy ne intervyuu diya he ki 70 lakh bhartiya sena kashmir ke azaadi gang ko haraa nahin sakati
 With this, he put a picture of Arundhati Roy, in which she is placed in front of the army jeep
 ise lekar kai bade news channelon par baqayda bahes ho gai
 The debate was such that the crowd could be aggressive against Arundhati Roy
 jabaki arundhati raay na to haal main srinagar gayi thim or na hi aisa koi intervyuu kisi ko diya tha
 Arundhati Roy did give an interview to Outlook magazine a year ago, but Paresh Rawal's tweet was not about that interview
 24 may ko thewire
 in When it came to know how information reached Paresh Rawal, another dangerous aspect of fake news came to light
 tippaniyan Paresh Rawal tweeted this fake interview of Arundhati Roy from the Facebook page named The Nationalist
 is pej par khabar pahunchi postcard
 From the news, many news of this website has been disputed in relation to fake news
 is par likhaa tha ki arundhati roy ne yah intervyuu The Times of Islamabad ko diya he ki 70 lakh bhartiya sena kashmir ke azaadi gang ko haraa nahin sakati hai
 postcardnews did not reveal its source but The Wire found that Radio Pakistan had aired it all before
 jis The Times of Islamabad ko pakistani akhbaar bataaya ja rahaa he, wo website he, akhbaar nahin he
 postcard
 news ne jis din ye phek intervyuu chapa tha usee din ise satyavijayi
 com also published and four five websites also gave it their place
 in sabhi kaa naam bhi phek news ke silsile main aa chukaa he
 thewire
 in pakadaa ki internethindu

 aap dekhiye ki kis tarah pakistani site se chalate hue phek news phek intervyuu bharat ke saansad ke twitor handle par pahunchataa he or vahaan se bharat ke channelon par arundhati roy ke kilaaf zordaar bahes chhid jaati he
 Paresh Rawal deleted the tweet but even today this fake interview radio pakistan website and post card of India
 news par tasviir ke saath he
 It is also a strategy
 jab vivaad tham jayega to phir se is phek intervyuu ko ghumaya jane lagegaa
 Or what the address is being rotated in whatsapp University
 aap sochiye yah kitna khataranaak pahalu he
 India and Pakistan websites can also help each other in the case of fake news
 koi aapke naam se pakistan main phek intervyuu chhapava de, jab tak aap safai denge, tivi channel, netaa or ye website milakar aapkaa bhayankar nuksaan kar chuke honge
 Right now, those who raise their voice are being intimidated, weak and timid opposition is being intimidated, but soon you will also be fixed through this game
 balki kiya bhi ja rahaa he
 It is also a form of fake news
 aaj ke samay aapako phek news dena or itihaas ke tathyon ko bhi phek kar dena
 Think of it this way, you will neither be able to know about today, nor about yesterday
 internet par nehru ke bare main phek jaankariyaan bhari ja rahi hai
 When your child downloads for school college project, he will write wrong information
 ho saktaa he ki raajnneetik vichaardhaara se prerit shikshak unheen jaankariyon par use number bhi de den or wo puri zindagi is yakeen main jeeta rahegaa ki jo jaanata he vah sahi tha jabaki wo phek tha
 Fake news and fake videos have led to communal violence, murder and property damage
 lekin isi phek news ke zariye itihaas kii sabase badi hinsa se judi jaankaree ko hi mitaane kii koshish kii gai
 You saw last week that Prime Minister Modi visited the Holocaust Memorial on the Israeli tour
 jahaan unhone itihaas kaa ek krurtam adhyay bataaya tha
 But Carole Cadwallader of the Guardian newspaper notices that on Google's search that Did the Holocaust really happen? So the answer is that the Holocaust had not happened and the search result was a newly Nazi website stormfront
 org par le jaataa he jahaan is tarah kii baaten likhi hai ki chotii ke das kaaran ki holocost hua hi nahin tha
 In his article dated 11 December 2016, Carroll talks about this in a Guardian newspaper
 unhone bataaya he ki you tub par bhi is tarah ke kai video hai
 Whereas books and historical documents state that Hitler killed six million people
 carol ne jab yah sawaal uthaaya to uske baad google ne sudhaar kar diya lekin sochiye internet par aise kitne aitihaasik saakshyon ko badal diya gaya hoga
 Just as governments change the history books
 aap sochate hai ki yah aapke or aapke bachche ke liye mahatvapurn sawaal nahin he

 If you are reading fake history about whatsapp Nehru and Holocaust, when your child also comes with the same fake information, then you might say that wow how sensible it has become

 Millions of people are sharing such fake history, fake news

 lakhon log is tarah kii phek history, phek news share kar rahe hai
 Last year, a website called Buzzfeed made a list of 5 big fake news which is as follows
 - obama ne desh ke sabhi skulon main nishtha kii shapath lene par roak lagane ke aadesh de diye hai
 It has been shared 21 million times on Facebook
 - pope francis ne donald trump kii ummidavaari kaa samarthan kiya, ise 9 lakh baar share kiya gaya
 There is another interesting fact
 amareeki akhbaar The Sun Chronicle ke Tom Reilly ne 29 june, 2017 ko apane ek sampadakeey main likhaa ki associadet press jaisi badi sanstha bhi phek news kaa shikaar hui he
 While the institution is 171 years old, the story of 1700 newspapers, 5000 TV and radio broadcast aps around the world is published
 to sochiye kahaan kahaan phek news pahunch jaataa hoga
 This is the condition of the organization which has 243 news bureaus in 120 countries
 bharat ke aath das tivi channel mila denge to bhi itane reporter nahin honge
 The Associated Press has admitted that it had some news which was not news
 isliye api ne ek nayaa news feechar shuru kiya he Not Real News
 Under this, such fake news will be exposed which went viral on Twitter or other platforms
 phir bhi yah kaam ye bhi kisi badi jhil ko chalni se saafe karne jaisaa he
 Fake news is a broad category
 isaki kai upashakhaayen hai
 There is a branch of fake pictures
 kai netaaon ke twit se lekar sarkaar kii report tak main phek tasviren pahunch jaati hai or vahaan se aap logon ke bich ki vaah dekho kya nazaaraa he
 Recently, on the page number 40 of the 2016-17 Annual Report of the Home Ministry of India, it was informed that there is an international border, it has been approved to arrange 2043 km of bright light there, only 100 km is left
 has gone
 baaki ho gaya he
 To show this, a picture was put in the report of the Ministry of Home Affairs, below which is written the arrangement of fast light at the border
 jise aap dekhakar samajhenge ki vaah ye to kamaal hi ho gaya
 But when altnews on 14 June
 in ne is tasviir ko jhooth bataate hue report chhaapi to sab hairaan rah gaye
 After all, how can a fake picture go in the report of the Home Ministry? ai kahaan se
 Was this report made by searching Google? altnews ne bataaya ki yah tasviir spain morocco seemaa kii he
 It is a matter of fact that the Home Secretary of the Home Ministry did not delay at all
 hamaari sahyogi nita sharma ne report kii ki grihasachiv ne report kii taiyaari se jude adhikariyon se safai maangi to pataa chalaa ki biguef se ye tasviir ai thi
 The Home Secretary expressed regret for this and the picture has been removed from the online version of the annual report
 magar teen maheene se yah tasviir maujuud thi
 Know where you must have reached
 agar alt news ne apni report main bataaya he ki hindutwa
 The information started to be promoted as an achievement of the government
 likhaa gaya ki bharat-paak or bharat-bangladesh seemaa ko puri tarah se sil karne kaa kaam bhi jor se chalaa hua he or jald hi simaaen pehle kii apeksha kaaphi zyaada surakshit ho jaaengi
 Seeing a working government do this makes one feel quite good
 
 
 yahi nahin, bijepi ke saansad paresh rawal ke do twit kii charchaa karne ja rahaa hum
 The first tweet is on July 3
 saansad paresh rawal ne purv raashtrapati e pi je abdul kalam kaa ek bayaan twitor handle par share kar diya
 Wrote that this pseudo is for the Liberal people
 baad main pataa chalaa ki wo bayaan kalam kaa tha hi nahin
 "it was written in this statement that i tried to reconcile Pakistan by citing Islam but i did not betray the motherland
 " jab hangaamaa hua to paresh rawal ne kaha ki mujhe pataa nahin tha ki yah phek he
 If there was someone else in their place, i would have checked it twice, but because of Kalam i felt it right
 yah bilkul mumkin he ki aisa hua he or aisa ho jaataa he
 Anyone gets caught in such pictures and statements
 lekin jab unhone mashhoor lekhika arundhati roy ko lekar ek twit kiya to uske kai khataranaak pahalu saamne aa gaye
 On 17 May 2017, Paresh Rawal tweeted that Arundhati Roy has given an interview that 70 lakh Indian Army cannot defeat the Azadi Gang of Kashmir
 isi ke saath unhone arundhati roy kii tasviir laga di jisamen wo sena kii jeep ke aage bithai gayi hai
 Many big news channels got debated about this
 bahes kaa tevar aisa tha ki arundhati roy ke khilaaf bheed aakraamak ho sakati thi
 While Arundhati Roy neither went to Srinagar recently nor gave any such interview to anyone
 arundhati raay ne ek saal pehle outluk patrika ko zarur intervyuu diya tha magar paresh rawal kaa twit us intervyuu ko lekar nahin tha
 Thewire on 24 May
 in ne jab yah pataa lagaaya ki paresh rawal tak jaankaree kaise pahunchi to phek news kaa ek or khataranaak pahalu saamne aa gaya
 The comments paresh rawal ne arundhati roy kaa yah phek intervyuu The Nationalist naam ke fasebuk pej se uthaakar twit kar diya
 The postcard reached the news on this page
 news se, is website kii kai khabaren phek news ke silsile main vivaadit ho chuki hai
 It was written on this that Arundhati Roy gave this interview to The Times of Islamabad that 70 lakh Indian Army cannot defeat the Azadi Gang of Kashmir
 postcardenus ne apana sorce nahin bataaya lekin vir ne paaya ki radio pakistan ne sabas pehle yah prasaarit kiya tha
 The Times of Islamabad, which is being described as a Pakistani newspaper, is a website, not a newspaper

 news satyavijayi the day the fake interview was published
 com ne bhi chapa or chaar paanch website ne bhi ise apane yahaan jagah di
 All these names have also come in connection with Fake News
 thewire
 in caught that internethindu
 in ne apni story main Times of Islamabad kaa link diya tha
 You see how the fake news fake interview going through the Pakistani site reaches the Twitter handle of the MP of India and from there a fierce debate is started against Arundhati Roy on the channels of India
 paresh rawal ne twit dilit kar diya lekin aaj bhi yah phek intervyuu radio pakistan kii website or bharat ke post card
 News is on the picture
 yah bhi ek ranneeti he
 When the controversy stops, this fake interview will start to be revived
 yaa kya pataa whatsap uniwarsity main ghumaya hi ja rahaa ho
 Think about what a dangerous aspect this is
 phek news ke maamle main bharat or pakistan kii website bhi ek duusare kii madad kar sakati hai
 Someone will get a fake interview printed in Pakistan in your name, by the time you give cleanliness, TV channels, politicians and these websites together will have done you a terrible loss
 abhi to iske zariye awaz uthaane waalon ko daraaya ja rahaa he, kamazor or darpok vipaksh ko daraaya ja rahaa he lekin jaldi hi is khel ke zariye aap logon ko bhi fiks kiya jane lagegaa

 "when there was an uproar, Paresh Rawal said that i did not know it was fake
 agar inaki jagah koi or hota to main ise do baar check karata magar kalam kii vajah se mujhe yah sahi laga
 It is quite possible that this has happened and it happens
 koi bhi aisi tasveeron or bayanon ke jhaanse main aa jaataa he
 But when he made a tweet about famous writer Arundhati Roy, many dangerous aspects came out of it
 17 may 2017 ko paresh rawal ne twit kiya ki arundhati roy ne intervyuu diya he ki 70 lakh bhartiya sena kashmir ke azaadi gang ko haraa nahin sakati
 With this, he put a picture of Arundhati Roy, in which she is placed in front of the army jeep
 ise lekar kai bade news channelon par baqayda bahes ho gai
 The debate was such that the crowd could be aggressive against Arundhati Roy
 jabaki arundhati raay na to haal main srinagar gayi thim or na hi aisa koi intervyuu kisi ko diya tha
 Arundhati Roy did give an interview to Outlook magazine a year ago, but Paresh Rawal's tweet was not about that interview

 balki kiya bhi ja rahaa he
 The Associated Press has admitted that it had some news which was not news
 isliye api ne ek nayaa news feechar shuru kiya he Not Real News
 Under this, such fake news will be exposed which went viral on Twitter or other platforms
 phir bhi yah kaam ye bhi kisi badi jhil ko chalni se saafe karne jaisaa he
 Fake news is a broad category
 isaki kai upashakhaayen hai
 There is a branch of fake pictures
 kai netaaon ke twit se lekar sarkaar kii report tak main phek tasviren pahunch jaati hai or vahaan se aap logon ke bich ki vaah dekho kya nazaaraa he
 Recently, on the page number 40 of the 2016-17 Annual Report of the Home Ministry of India, it was informed that there is an international border, it has been approved to arrange 2043 km of bright light there, only 100 km is left
 has gone
 baaki ho gaya he
 To show this, a picture was put in the report of the Ministry of Home Affairs, below which is written the arrangement of fast light at the border
 jise aap dekhakar samajhenge ki vaah ye to kamaal hi ho gaya
 But when altnews on 14 June
 in ne is tasviir ko jhooth bataate hue report chhaapi to sab hairaan rah gaye
 After all, how can a fake picture go in the report of the Home Ministry? ai kahaan se
 Was this report made by searching Google? altnews ne bataaya ki yah tasviir spain morocco seemaa kii he
 It is a matter of fact that the Home Secretary of the Home Ministry did not delay at all
 hamaari sahyogi nita sharma ne report kii ki grihasachiv ne report kii taiyaari se jude adhikariyon se safai maangi to pataa chalaa ki biguef se ye tasviir ai thi
 The Home Secretary expressed regret for this and the picture has been removed from the online version of the annual report
 magar teen maheene se yah tasviir maujuud thi
 Know where you must have reached
 agar alt news ne apni report main bataaya he ki hindutwa
 The information started to be promoted as an achievement of the government
 likhaa gaya ki bharat-paak or bharat-bangladesh seemaa ko puri tarah se sil karne kaa kaam bhi jor se chalaa hua he or jald hi simaaen pehle kii apeksha kaaphi zyaada surakshit ho jaaengi
 Seeing a working government do this makes one feel quite good
 
 
 yahi nahin, bijepi ke saansad paresh rawal ke do twit kii charchaa karne ja rahaa hum
 The first tweet is on July 3
 saansad paresh rawal ne purv raashtrapati e pi je abdul kalam kaa ek bayaan twitor handle par share kar diya

 "it was written in this statement that i tried to reconcile Pakistan by citing Islam but i did not betray the motherland
 " jab hangaamaa hua to paresh rawal ne kaha ki mujhe pataa nahin tha ki yah phek he
 If there was someone else in their place, i would have checked it twice, but because of Kalam i felt it right
 yah bilkul mumkin he ki aisa hua he or aisa ho jaataa he
 Anyone gets caught in such pictures and statements

 On the other hand, PDP leader and former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti said that even though the government of India has denied the interference of any third party on Jammu and Kashmir, the mention of President Trump on this issue widely reflects policy change
 america kaa itihaas aisa nahin he ki do pakshon ke bich jari vivaadon ko sulajhane ke liye uski ahm bhoomika rahi ho lekin ham chaahate hai ki donon desh aapasi baatcheet ke jariye is vivaad ko sulajhaayen
 President Trump claimed in a press conference with visiting Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday that Prime Minister Modi has asked Pakistan to mediate the dispute
 bharat ne trump ke bayaan ko tatkaal khaarij kar diya
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravish Kumar tweeted, "prime Minister Narendra Modi did not make any such request to the US President
 " pakistan ke pradhanmantri ko afghanistan yuddh sulajhane main utsaah dikhaate hue trump ne kashmir mudde main bhi khud ko madhyasth bataaya
 There was a time when Nero, the Emperor of Rome, ordered, "give them food, entertain them
" 
 
 " or us vakt ke baad se sabhi sattavadi janaakankshaon ke aadhaar par samarthan maangate samay naatakeeyata kaa bhi istemaal karte rahe hai, lekin aisa us tarah bharat main koi nahin kar paaya, jaisaa narendra modi ne apni hawa main udati laal pagadi, laharaati baahon, ghumaavdaar baton ke alaava apane bhaashan ko badi-badi screenon ke jariye dur-dur tak pahunchaakar kiya
 But what was important in that
 
 
 ? swatantraaa diwas par diya gaya unka bhaashan puraani bottle main puraani sharaab kii tarah tha, jis par sirf label nayaa laga diya gaya
 a lot is being said by him to talk about toilets in public from the public stage
 lekin pichley saal isi manch se unke purvavarti dow manmohan singh dwaara 'total sanitessan program' kii evaj main ghoshit kiye gaye kaarykram 'nirmal bharat abhiyaan' main unhone nayaa kya joda? kuch nahin
 
 
 In fact, attention to cleanliness has always been the priority of our enlightened leaders, including Mahatma Gandhi, who not only took a broom in South Africa himself, but also asked Kasturba to clean up his own dirt
 unka kahana tha, "safai rakhana paramatma kii bhakthi samaan he
 
 
 "but he did not say this by climbing the ramparts of the Red Fort, but he set a personal example, starting with himself and his family in an unobtrusive manner, showing inner humility
 nishchit rup se unke sampurna 'sakaaratmak kaarykram' kii ruparekha nijee tathaa saamaajik swatchta ke aasapaas gumti he
 We did not need to explain the importance of toilets by Modi, that he should come and tell us about the progress towards total sanitation, and explain the obstacles coming in the way of the decades-old Nirmal Gram Abhiyan
 yadi modi ne apane swabhaav ke mutabik nae-nae naare gadhane ke sthaan par thodaa bhi adhyayan kiya hota, to unhen pataa chal gaya hota ki empilad fund se shauchalayon kaa nirmaan karnaa, jaisaa main us vakt bhi kar rahaa tha, jab modi khaaki nikar pahanakar prachaar or pravachan dene main jute the, samasya nahin he, kyonki aisa karnaa aasaan he, lekin samasya unke rakrakhaav ko sunishchit karne main aati he
 At the time when such public toilets are built, it seems as if the Taj Mahal has been built, but in a single week they are not even useable, because there is no proper maintenance
 or yadi modi ke paas haalia surveykshanon ko padhane ke liye zaraa bhi vakt tathaa ichha hoti, to vah jaan jate ki bhale hi saarvajanik shauchalayon ke sthaan par gharon main nijee shauchalay banaakar de die jaaen, hamaare yahaan unhen lagaataar istemaal karne ke liye prerit karne kii vyavastha kaa abhaav he
 So, when the biggest challenge seems to be to inspire the society, the easiest and effective way is to explain the importance of cleanliness through the Panchas and Sarpanch Gram Sabhas
 lekin yadi modi ke swatantraaa diwas bhaashan ke hisaab se chalem, to saaf he ki unhone apane 'gujarati bhai' mohandas karmchand gandhi kii bhi nahin suni, jo kehete the ki panchayat raaj ke bina bharat pragati nahin kar saktaa
 Of course, how can an authoritarian easily prepare for the sharing of powers? It is not that we did not suspect this
 jahaan tak panchayat raaj kaa sawaal he, modi kaa gujarat sabase kharaab pradarshan karne vaale rajyon main se ek he
 And this was proved once again, when he made a futile proposal of 'sansad Adarsh gram Yojana', which the mps have to run from their MPLAD fund
 sabase pehle to yah sochie, 700 'saansad adarsh' gaanv un bheeshan samasyaon ko hal karne kii disha main kya sahaayta karenge, jinka saamana saat lakh gaanv kar rahe hai
 After this, the more important thing to think about is why 'MP program', why not 'panchayat Adarsh gram Yojana'? By implementing this scheme through the Panchayats, it could be instantly delivered to every village in the country, provided the villages were effectively empowered under the Constitution by giving necessary procedures, money and proper rights to the officials
 aah! modi ke 'nae bharat' main logon kaa shashaktikaran nahin hone vaala, balki aisa lagata he, sab kuch modi ko 'sant' kaa darja dilaae jane kii taraf bad rahaa he
 The same thing applies to Modi's preachy, but meaningless remarks in which he asked parents to impose similar restrictions on sons and daughters to prevent rape and sexual harassment of women
 unki baat us vakt kahin zyaada prabhavi dhang se sunai detii, yadi vah nihalchand meghavaal ko apane mantrimandal se nishkasit kar dete, saarvajanik sthanon par mahilaon kii suraksha ke liye adhik kargar kanoon evam vyavastha banane tathaa aparaadhiyon ke viruddh samay par kadi nyaayik karrwai karne ke liye adhik vyaavhaarik kadam (16 saal ke aparaadhiyon ko faansee dene ke alaava) uthaate
 But if there is a road map ready to be put into practice, then who should call them Modi? vah sirf upadesh dete hai, karte kuch nahin
 Gandhi said this, and also presented a high example of moral purity
 unhone kaha or kiya, lekin modi baar-baar sirf bolte hai, or bachakaane naare dete rahete hai
 'make in India' is the latest in the link of these childish slogans of Narendra Modi
 'swavlamban' or 'swadeshi' bhi 'mek in india' nahin he to or kya he? or agar modi apni galat-salat angrezi main videshiyon ko nirmaan kshetra main nivesh ke liye aamantrit karne kii koshish kar rahe the, to usamen bhi nayaa kya he? pivi narsimha raav tathaa unke vittamantri manmohan singh ke kaal main aarthik sudhaaron ke shuru hone ke samay se hi ham bhi vyapak tareeke se videshi niveshkon ko lubhaate aa rahe hai
 The success may have been largely away from us, but the spectacular flow of funds in our stock markets, especially through the infamous Mauritius route, has increased manifold
 sudhaaron ke baavjood yadi nirmaan kshetra main pratyaksh videshi nivesh niraashajanak rahaa he, to uskaa kaaran yah nahin he ki upie sarkaar naare gadhane main naakaam rahi, balki yah he ki videshi nivesh ko niyantrit karne vaale niyamon auki viniyamon ko kholane ke raste main rajnatik, saamaajik or aarthik adchane - vaastavik adchane - hai
 If Modi had the courage (or foolishness) to abolish all these rules, he would not have needed hollow slogans to attract foreign capital
 lekin chunki vah jaanate hai ki unki bhagava brigade hi unhen koi krantikari kadam nahin uthaane degi, isliye nitiyon main kisi arthpurna parivartan ke sthaan par videshi niveshkon ko modi kii ore se sirf ek or naaraa hasil hua
 And it is no surprise that on the eve of Independence Day, 'the New York Times' has labeled Modi as 'zero' (cipher)
 'shunya' ek baar phir siddh hua, unke ek or naare se - sampradayikta par 10 saal ke sthagan kaa aahvaan
 i will abstain from raising this question, because many people have raised it as to why only 10 years, why not forever? It would have been better if Modi had in front of him an apology for the massacre of Muslims in Gujarat, and publicly castigated all the Bhagavats, Togadias and Kodnis whom he is surrounded by, and through whose politics only He has been able to reach Race Course Road
 kya vah unhen nakaar sakate hai? kya vah unhen nakaarna chaahate hai? uttar pradesh main hone vaale chunaav se pehle kya vah yah vaada karne ke liye taiyaar hai ki chunaav-purv sampradayik hinsa main shaamil hone vaale har 'nikar-vaale' ko vah sangh parivaar se baahar nikaal denge? nahin, kyonki yadi unhone aisa kiya, to sangh parivaar sabase pehle unhen baahar phenk degaa
 Modi is like Lady Macbeth, a character in Shakespeare's novel - "my hands are stained with blood, and no perfume of any sort can smell it
" 
 
 " (here’s the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand)
 Finally, let's talk about the Planning Commission
 ise khatm kar dene ko lekar bahes ho sakati he, lekin modi ne vaisaa nahin kiya
 We did not get anything other than to obey his efforts to end one of the most illustrious traditions of the Nehru era
 yah bilkul vaisaa hi he, jaisaa dilli ke sultan kiya karte the
 They used to tear down all the previous idols, but could never give any explanation of this sabotage
 yojana ayog ko khatm kar dena, vistaar se yah bataae bina ki uske sthaan par kya aane vaala he, vaisaa hi he, jaise koi baccha jaanboojhkar apane khilone sirf is vajah se tod daale, kyonki aisa karne main use mazaa aata he
 We need to return to the ramparts of the Red Fort to behave like adults
 hamen zarurat he ek jawaharlal nehru kii, jinhone desh kii 'saubhaahgya se bhent' kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 We need a Lal Bahadur Shastri who is giving the slogan 'jai Jawan Jai Kisan'
 hamen zarurat he ek indira gandhi kii, ninhone padosi purvi pakistan main jari narsanhaar ke khilaaf saare desh ko ekajute kiya
 We need a Rajiv Gandhi who announces the Assam Accord, advances the Punjab Agreement, predicts the Mizo Accord
 hamen zarurat he ek narsimha raav kii, jo desh ko samruddhi ke path par agrasar karne ke liye rodmap prastut kare
 We also need the humble humor of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, we also need the voice of Dr
 Manmohan Singh

 Lok Sabha member from Ladakh Jamyang Tsering Namgyal said that many people want to take advantage of the business potential by coming to their area, but only those in the area are welcome who really want to take advantage of resources and will not misuse it
