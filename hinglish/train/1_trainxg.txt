 The fourth Test match of the 5 match series between India and England starts in Manchester from today
 lords test main jeet kaa jashn abhi shabaab par hi tha ki england ne tisare test main bharat ko patkhni dekar siries 1-1 se baraabar kar lee
 For now, both teams will now try to take the lead in the series by winning the fourth Test
 lords test haarane ke baad aisa lag rahaa tha ki england kii team puri tarah se bikhri hui he, lekin southampton main jeet england ke liye mahaj ek jeet nahin thi, balki ye jeet team ko dobaaraa ek unit ke taur par khadi kar gai
 At present, there are more problems for Team India than hosts England: It is scattered that the injury of Team Indian Shant Sharma out of the team was no less than a nightmare for India, and India struggled continuously with their bowling in the third Test
 chauthe test main bhi eshanth kii gairmaujuudagi ne captain dhoni kii mushkilen jahaan pehle se hi badha rakhi thim, vahiin mohammad shami kaa out of form hona, pankaj singh kaa nottingham main wicketles janaa captain ke sir dard ko or badha rahi he
 In such a situation, the question is, should Varun Aaron be included in the team? The question here is not just about bowling but many more
 ballebaaji main shikhar dhawan, cheteshwar pujaara, viraat kohli, rohit sharma kaa form bahut badi chintaa kaa kaaran he
 In such a situation, the question arises again whether Gautam Gambhir should be included in place of Dhawan? Should Rohit Sharma get another chance? Murali Vijay and Ajinkya Rahane's batting in this series has been excellent and India will hope that their form remains the same
 vahiin kuch maukon par captain kool em es dhoni or rabindra jadeja kaa bhi balla bolaa he, haalanki donon abhi tak lagaataar acha pradarshan nahin kar paae hai
 England are freshly challenged compared to Bulandbharat
 tisare test main england ke lagbhag sabhi ballebaaj shandaar form main dikhe
 Injured Stuart Broad could be replaced by Steven Finn
 iske alaava team main koi badlaav kii gunjaaish najar nahin aati
 However, the bowling of Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes is of little concern to England
 pich reportis daure main pich bhi charchaa kaa ek bada mudda rahi
 Even the ICC is not happy with the pitches of this series so far
 haalanki kaha ja rahaa he ki manchester kii pich ab tak kii sabhi pichon se tej hogi
 However it will not have grass like lords

 India have played 8 matches in Manchester so far, but so far they have not won any matches, while losing 3 matches
 1990 ke baad ye pehla mauka he jab bharat or england manchester main test match khel rahe hai

 There were many revolutionaries in the freedom struggle, whose name got lost somewhere in the pages of history
 aisa hi ek naam tha yatindranath mukherjee
 Those who were known as Bagha Jatin
 kehete hai ki desh ko angrejon se aaazaad karaane ke liye bagha jatin ne ek aisi yojana banaai thi ki desh 1915 main hi aaazaad ho gaya hota
 If this happens then perhaps the history of independence of the country would also have been completely different
 bagha kisi bhi angrej ko agar akelaa dekhte to uski pitayee kar dete the
 He is said to have once beaten eight Firangi together
 yatindranath mukherjee bangala ke nadia jile main paidaa hue the, jo ab bangladesh main he
 After the death of his father, he was raised by his mother Sharatshashi

 This was the reason that his body was strong
 bachapan main apane mamaa ke saath unki mulaakaat aksar rabindra nath tagore se hoti thi
 Bagha Jatin was very much influenced by Tagore
 ve naatakon main bhaag liya karte the
 Once, on insulting an Indian, he beat up four-five Britishers together
 uske baad unhone kalakatta central college main daakhila liya
 Then he came in contact with Swami Vivekananda
 isi dauraan swami ji ne unhen kushti ke daav pech seekhney ke liye ek akhaade main bhej diya
 From there, his desire to do something for the country was strong
 varsh 1899 main ne barrister pingale ke sachiv banakar mujffarpur ja pahunche
 Pingale was a lawyer as well as a historian
 usee ke saath rahakar bagha jatin ko laga ki bharatiyon kii apni ek army honi chahie
 Just then, he started building this army
 shaadi ke baad jatin ke bade bete kii maut ho gai
 He was under great stress
 jis vajah se wo haridwar chale gaye
 When he returned to his village, there was a panic by a leopard
 jatin uski talash main nikal pade or unka saamana jangal main ek tiger se hua
 Which he killed with his khukri
 vahiin se unka naam bagha jatin padaa
 An organization of revolutionaries was formed in the year 1900
 jisamen bagha jatin kii ahm bhoomika thi
 The organization was expanded to Bengal, Orissa and Bihar
 isi dauraan varsh 1905 main britain ke rajkumaar kalakatta main the
 At his reception, Jatin beaten many Britishers, angry at the insult of women
 is ghatana se krantikariyon ke man main bagha jatin kaa sammaan or bad gaya
 After this incident, Bagha Jatin established a bomb factory in Deoghar with the help of Varinder Ghosh

 One day at the same Siliguri station, he encountered British soldiers

 There he was given military training

 In this way Pandurang M
 Bapat and Hemdas learned to make bombs from a Russian revolutionary
 isi bich jatin ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 The then Firangi government was upset with the revolutionaries
 isliye 1912 main rajdhani kolkata se badalakar dilli banaai gai
 The Secret Society was eliminating the oppressors on Indians in those days
 tabi ek krantikari pakadaa gaya or usne jatin ke naam kaa khulaasa kar diya
 Jatin was arrested for the murder of an English officer
 usee bich jail main band bagha jatin ne anya kaidiyon ke saath milakar ek nai yojana banaai
 This was the biggest plan ever to liberate the country
 itihaas main is yojana ko german plot yaa hindu-german conspiresi ke naam se janaa gadha
 If that plan had succeeded, our country would have been liberated in 1915 itself
 usee plan ke mutabik farvari 1915 main 1857 kii tarah kranti karne kii yojana thi
 But at the same time, Kripal Singh, the brother of a rebel soldier of the Punjab 23rd Cavalry, betrayed the revolutionaries and brought all his plans to the British government
 saare plan par pani phir gaya
 Here, English officers had received the news of Jatin and his companions

 Not only this, Shivraj Singh Chauhan has followed the path of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and has appealed to the people not to fill the increased electricity bills, if their electricity is cut then they will come to connect their connections themselves
 is baavat shivaraj singh chouhan ke daftar ke aadhikarik soshal media handle dwaara likhaa gaya, "jamaa mat karnaa bade hue bijli bill line kaati to main aauungaa jodne
 "in fact, before the Delhi Assembly elections in 2013, Aam Aadmi Party's national convenor and current Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal waged agitation against the then CM Sheila Dixit government all over Delhi against the increased power prices and appealed to the people to get electricity Don't pay the increased rates
 kejariwal ne kaha tha ki agar kisi ke ghar kii bijli kaati gai to vah uske ghar jaakar bijli kaa conection jod denge
 During his movement, Arvind Kejriwal did this too and reconnected the electricity connections in many houses where the electrical connections were disconnected
 jo arvind kejariwal ne 2013 main kiya 2019 main madhyapradesh ke purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan vahi kar rahe hai
 But on the same statement of Shivraj Singh Chauhan, many people on social media have drawn their attention towards Uttar Pradesh
 bataa den ki haal hi main uttar pradesh kii yogi sarkaar ne bijli kii daron main lagbhag 12 pratishat kii badhotaree kii he
 On this, many people on social media asked Shivraj Singh Chauhan, "when will Mama UP come"? In reply to Shivraj Singh's post, Arunodaya Vishwakarma wrote, "let the people of Uttar Pradesh do the same, according to you and you will come to join"
 dharmendra patel naamak shaks ne shivaraj ko jawaab diya, "uttar pradesh waalo dhyaan se padho bill jamaa nahi karnaa he"
 So the same social media handle named Mustafa Rizvi wrote in response to this post, "UP people are also ready to welcome you"
 madhyapradesh main apni jameen phir se majboot karne ke liye shivaraj kejariwal kii raah par chalane kii koshish kar to rahe hai, lekin log upi sarkaar ke bahaane unako trol kar rahe hai

 The comments mukhya sachiv kii is chitthee main centre ke us nirdesh kaa hawala diya gaya he, jisamen grih sachiv dharmpal ko hataane kaa aadesh galat bataaya gaya tha
 Of course, the Kejriwal government is still adamant that their decision regarding the transfer of the Home Secretary is correct, but now this letter of the Chief Secretary has given them a big shock
 chif secretary ne ye bhi likhaa he ki home, land or building vibhaag main transfar or posting grih mantralay yaa up rajyapal se salaah lekar hi kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, till now the orders of the Delhi Government given in this case have been canceled and the decision of the Ministry of Home Affairs will have to be accepted by the authorities
 mukhya sachiv ke is chitthee kii copy grih sachiv dharmpal or uparajyapal ke sachiv es si el das ko bhi bheji gai he
 In this letter of the Chief Secretary, the instruction of the Center has been cited in which the order to remove Home Secretary Dharampal was wrong
 beshak kejariwal sarkaar ab bhi is baat par adi hui ho ki grih sachiv ke tabadale ko lekar unka faisla sahi he, lekin ab mukhya sachiv kii is chitthee se unhen bada jhatka laga he
 The Chief Secretary has also written that transfer and posting in the Home, Land and Building Department can be done only after consulting the Ministry of Home Affairs or the Deputy Governor
 isliye ab tak is maamle main die gaye dilli sarkaar ke aadesh nirast ho gaye hai or grih mantralay ke faisle ko hi adhikariyon ko maananaa hoga
 a copy of this letter of the Chief Secretary has also been sent to Home Secretary Dharam Pal and Lieutenant Governor's Secretary SCL Das
 chif secretary ne ye bhi likhaa he ki home, land or building vibhaag main transfar or posting grih mantralay yaa up rajyapal se salaah lekar hi kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, till now the orders of the Delhi Government given in this case have been canceled and the decision of the Ministry of Home Affairs will have to be accepted by the authorities

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special newzlator a US court has dismissed a case of human rights violations filed by a Sikh group against the Congress party in the anti-sikh riots case
 court ne mukadmaa khaarij karte hue kaha ki samooh ke paas aisa mukadmaa daayar karne ko lekar koi kanoonee aadhaar nahin he or jo maamle america se jude yaa uski chintaa kaa vishay nahin hai, unki sunwaayee america adaalat main nahin hogi
 Judge Robert Sweet accepted the Congress Party's appeal to dismiss the suit filed by the Sikh for Justice (SFJ), ordering that the human rights group cannot be a plaintiff and that individual plaintiffs are not legal representatives
 sweet ne kal apane aadesh main kaha ki esaje yah sabit karne main asafal rahaa ki yah maamla america se judaa yaa uski chintaa kaa vishay he
 He said that no other amendments are allowed and the case is dismissed
 desh ke sabase bade rajya uttar pradesh kii satta par yogi adityanath virajman hai
 It is going to be 6 months for the Yogi holding the throne of the kingdom
 yogi ke saamne pehali agniparikshaw gorakhpur or phulpur kii loksabhaa seat ko barkaraar rakhane kii he, jabaki vipaksh unhen gheraabandi karne kii puri taiyaari kar rakhi he
 In such a situation, it has to be seen now how Yogi keeps the bjp's victory by breaking the opposition's strategy? UP cmyogi Adityanath and both deputy cms Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma have been elected unopposed to the MLC
 aise main yogi kii gorakhpur or maury kii phulpur loksabhaa seat khaali ho gai, jahaan chunaav ayog jald hi upachunaav ke liye farmaan jari kar saktaa he
 Actually, if we look at the mathematics of Gorakhpur and Phulpur, then there has been a very interesting battle in both the parliamentary constituencies
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jahaan bijepi ko in siton par sabhi vipakshi dalon ko mili kul voton se bhi zyada vot mili the
 Gorakhpur is considered a traditional seat of BJP, hence Gorakhpur is called bjp's fortress
 mahant avaidhyanath ne 1989 main hindu mahasabha ke tikat par chunaav ke jeet kaa jo silsla shuru kiya, vah aaj bhi jari he
 Mahant Avaidyanath was a four-time MP from Gorakhpur, independent in 1970, Hindu Mahasabha in 1989, and again in 1991 and 1996 from BJP
 yogi paanch baar saansad banegorkhupar main mahant avaidhyanath kii raajnneetik viraasat ko yogi adityanath ne 1998 main sambhala to phir palatakar nahin dekha
 For the last five times, Yogi continued to reach Parliament on BJP ticket
 chaahe bispi kii soshal ejineering rahi ho yaa phir akhilesh kaa samaajwaad, kabhi unke saamne chunauti nahin ban sakaa or unke jeet kaa silsilaa lagaataar jari rahaa
 It is not easy for the opposition to win in Gorakhpur, Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat has become vacant after Yogi became UP CM in March 2017
 aise main yogi ke saamne bijepi ke durg ko bachaane ke liye agniparikshaw se guzarana hoga
 According to the Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat 2014, there were a total of 10,40,199 votes out of which Yogi got 5,39,127 votes, on the other hand SP got 2,26,344 votes, BSP got 1,76, 412 and Congress 45,719 votes
 aise main yogi ko akele hi in teenon party se zyada vot mila tha
 In this way, it will not be easy for the opposition to break into the fort of Yogi
 nehru kii seat rahi phulpurvahin phulpur loksabhaa seat kii agar baat karen, to yah congress kii paramparaagat seat rahi he
 Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of the country, has been contesting from Phulpur Lok Sabha seat and elected from this seat thrice to reach the Lok Sabha
 bijepi kaa pehalibar khulaa tha khataabijepi pehali baar 2014 main modi lahar main phulpur loksabhaa seat par jeetne main kaamyaab rahi he
 Keshav became a Member of Parliament by winning the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 in the Mauritius seat, but had to resign after becoming deputy CM of UP
 chaar baar espi jithidarasal phulpur seat par espi kaa bhi majboot janaadhar he
 This is the reason that from 1996 to 2004, the Samajwadi Party candidate has been winning continuously
 usase pehle do baar is seat par janata dal vijayi rahaa, jabaki 2009 main bispi ne jeet darj kii thi
 In such a situation, the biggest challenge for the BJP is to retain the Phulpur seat
 espi-bispi se zyada bijepi ko mili the mataloksabhaa chunaav 2014 ke mili maton ke lihaaj se dekha jaae to kul 9,60,341 maton main se bijepi ke keshav maury ko 5,03,564 espi ko 1,95,256 bispi ko 1,63,710 or congress ko 58,127 mat mili the
 In such a situation, even if the votes of the three parties are mixed, the BJP is not equal
 jeet barkaraar rakhana aasaan nahinupi main bijepi kii lahar 2014 ke loksabhaa yaa 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav jaisi nahin dikh rahi
 In such a situation, it was being speculated that the SP and the BSP could be united to surround the BJP, but so far nothing like this seems to be happening
 vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan jo bijepi kaa maahaul tha, vah kaaphi badal chukaa he
 If Yogi's 6-month tenure is seen, then he does not have any special achievements to count
 aise main bada sawah he ki bijepi in siton ko kis tarah se barkaraar rakh paaegi

 'mumbai main atyadhikabheedbhad kaa zikr karte hue shivasenaane likhaa he ki yahaan tyohaar nahin hone par bhi varsh bhar sadakon par jam rahata he or sadaken kai jagah sankari hai

 Shiv Sena admitted that the job of the courts is to provide justice to all, but the party also says that they should stay away from religious or faith matters, especially when it is not needed

 Amitabh questioned in his blog why there is no body in the Indian film community that stands up against those who attack freedom of expression? Big b said that the bodies representing political powers have their own ideology and manpower and they only support those things which ultimately benefit them
 lekin kalakaar ek rachaanatmak vyakti hota he uskaa raajnneeti se koi matlab nahin hota
 He said that the government has created a constitutional body Central Film Certification Board which investigates these disturbances
 ab kisi film nirmaataa ko apane kaam ko paas karaane ke liye aise kitne nikaayon ke paas janaa hoga
 Amitabh said that if the law says that permission has to be obtained from the green political party, every society and every citizen, then film making will no longer be an art
 unhone kaha ki yadi prayek vyakti kii sweekruti kii jarurat hogi to theatre main film dekhne ke liye koun bachegaa ? unhone kaha film udyog main kalakar samudaay hameshaa prabhavit rahegaa kyonki hamaara kaam film bananaa, yaa painting karnaa yaa kitaab likhnaa he
 Our entire career depends on ensuring that maximum number of people praise our work
 big bi ne kaha, hamen is baat ko darshakon par chhod dena chaiye ki ve kya dekhnaa chaahate hai or kya nahin
 Do not look if you do not like it
 film dekhne ke baad pasand nahin aaye to isaki aalochana kiijie
 But it is not in our law to attack, sabotage the film and the people involved in it
 unhone kaha ki ek baar sensor board ke paas kiye jane or ucch nyaayalay dwaara pradarshit kiye jane kii anumati diye jane ke baad bahut kuch kiye jane kii gunjaaish nahin thi
 The film will be screened and those who are opposing it will come to know that there is nothing in it that they are opposing

 in donon ke bich talmail banane main kai baar to unke prayaas safal hote hai lekin kai baar unhen niraashaa hi haath lagati he
 The biggest problem comes when a working woman becomes a mother
 maa hona apane aap main ek bahut badi jimmedaari he
 The child depends on the mother for every small and big need
 bhale hi ghar par bachche kii dekharekh koi kar rahaa ho lekinmaa kaa sara dhyaan apane bachche par laga rahaa he
 In such a situation, work is relaxed and the result is negative
 aap chahen to smart tareeke se kaam karke or samajhadaar maa banakar aap donon jimmedaariyon ko ekasaath nibhaa sakati hai
 These tips can be helpful for you: -to increase the coordination between the child and the office, work with complete planning and fix one of your routines
 jab aap sara kaam time management ke hisaab se karengi to aapako baar-baar ghadi dekhne kii jarurat nahin padegi or aap samay se kaam khatm karke apane bachche ke paas ja sakengi
 -keep all the child's belongings in a separate cupboard or box to save your time
 apane jaruri saamaan kii list bana len or uski jagah fiks kar den
 -if your child is very young, seek help from your partner, ask them to do small things
 aapke partner se milane vaali madad aapke kaam ko aasaan karegi or aapke pati bhi samajhenge ki aapke liye akele yah sab karnaa bahut mushkil he
 You can come to take care of the child or take help of meds
 maid ko acchhee tarah samajha den ki bachche ko kab khaanaa dena yaa phir use kis time par koun si dawa deni he
 Make such a system that at least twice a day, take care of your child
 -baccha hone ke baad bataur maa aapaki praathamiktaayen badal jaati hai
 Whatever work you do, do it in such a way that it will have a good effect on your child
 apane kaam ke prati bhi puri tarah nishthavan bani rahen or bevajaah kii chintaa-tanaav se dur rahane kii koshish karen

 According to the custom commissioner, now smugglers are bringing gold in the suitcase in the form of wire, gold is also being brought in the electronic goods transformer

 That is, the benefit of Rs 2000 on 10 grams of gold, if one kg of gold is brought, then the benefit of Rs 2 lakh
 yahi vajah he ki sone kii taskari ek aakarshak kaam he
 Experts say that the main reason for the difference in prices is heavy custom duty and VAT on gold in India, due to which gold is being sold very expensive in India

 Sources in the Customs Department say that smuggling of custom in Mumbai may have led smugglers to make Ahmedabad a gateway to Western India
 kyonki yahaan pakade gaye logon se pataa chalaa he ki wo yahaan se desh ke duusare hisson main sona pahunchane vaale the
 But Ahmedabad airport is equally caught with vigilance
 sabase chaunkaane vaali baat he taskari ke nae-nae tareeke
 Of the 25 cases the Customs Department has caught so far this year, the highest number of cases were of gold concealed in the body
 custom kamishnar capton sanjay gahalot ne enditivi ko bataaya ki kareeb 11 maamalon main to sona gudamarg main chupaaya gaya tha or jis maatra main sona tha wo sachmuch hairaan karne vaali baat thi
 Apart from this, smuggling of gold is also going on high-tech
 custom kamishnar ke mutabik ab taskar suutakes main vir ke taur par bharkar sona laa rahe hai, electronic saamaan ke transformar main bhi sona bhar kar laayaa ja rahaa he
 According to Gehlot, one case surprised his department, a person brought a microwave oven from Dubai
 custom adhikari ko shaq hua to uski jaanch kii gai
 When you turned on the microwave, the light inside burned, the plate was rotating inside, everything was fine, but even if the custom officer was not satisfied, he also heated the water in it
 bas tabhi baat khul gai kyonki usamen pani garam nahin ho rahaa tha
 Due to which, opening it and checking it gave gold in it
 tippaniyan Custom officials say that due to such new methods of smuggling, they also have to prepare more
 ab sawaal ye he ki sone ke daam pichley paanch saalon main sabase kam hai to aakhir ye taskari ho kyon rahi he
 Experts said that in India on Monday, 24 carat 10 grams of gold was priced at Rs 25,110, while in Dubai the price was Rs 23,000
 yani sone ke 10 gram par 2000 rupee kaa phayda, agar ek kilo sona laayaa jaae to 2 lakh rupee kaa phayda
 This is why gold smuggling is a lucrative job
 jaankaar kehete hai ki daamon main fark kii mukhya vajah he bharat main sone par baari custom duty or waite, jisaki vajah se bharat main sona bahut mahangaa bik rahaa he
 And unless the price difference in India is less than in the international market, it is difficult to stop gold smuggling

 Don't drag my name congress ne piem modi ko gherne ke liye lagaae the aropadarasal congress ne apane aadhikarik twitor acount par 'sahaara diary' se judi ek tasviir jari kii thi, jisamen dikhaaya gaya tha ki gujarat kaa siem rahete hue narendra modi ne sahaara samooh se 40 karod rupee kii 'rishwat' lee thi
 However, the Congress was surrounded by this question, because the way in which the alleged CM of Gujarat is mentioned in this alleged list of 2014, the name of the then CM of Delhi Sheila Dixit has been written to give one crore rupees
 modi ji, aapako meraa jitna majaak udaana he uda lo, lekin in kaagajon kii jaanch karwaao: rahul gandhisipich

 com / rnicmorr4j— INC India (@incindia)december 23, 2016empi or chhattisgarh ke siem kaa bhi namshila dikshit disambar 2013 tak dilli kii mukhyamantri thim or is kathith list main unhen sitambar 2013 main ek karod rupee nagad dene kii baat likhi gai he
 In this list, apart from Narendra Modi and Sheela Dixit, the Chief Ministers of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh also mention money
 gauratlab he ki congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi in dinon bhrashtachar ke maamle main pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue un par sahaara se rishwavat lene kaa aarope lagaate rahe he
 However, now in the same case, the name of the Congress leader and the party's CM candidate for UP elections Sheila Dixit will definitely blunt her attack
 dilli main chunaav kii sargarmi tej ho gai he
 Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party has released its manifesto
 yah ghoshnaa patr vishaal he or dilli se jude har pahalu par prakaash daalane kii koshish karata he
 Read: The important 40 promises of AAP include all the promises from women safety to the promises she made in her last manifesto, such as free water, cheap electricity, Jan Lokpal bill, etc
 isamen dilli ko purna darja dilwane kii bhi baat he
 In this manifesto, the party has not left anything that has to do with Delhi
 badahaal skulon ko sudhaarney se lekar 500 nae skool or 20 nae college kholane kii bhi isamen baat kahi gai he
 Apart from this, it has also been talked about development of villages and cleanliness of Yamuna
 yani koi bhi vishay nahin choda gaya he
 Kejriwal was also seen making various announcements to woo government employees such as the cashless scheme and his age
 kejariwal ko maaloom he ki dilli main kendra or rajya sarkaar ke lakh se bhi zyada karmchaaree rahete hai or unhen lubhaana jaruri he khaskar yah dekhte hue ki vah khud nai dilli vidhaan sabha seat se khadey hai jahaan sarkari karmchaaree bade paimaane par rahete hai
 There are about five lakh traders or businessmen in Delhi and they have kept a place for them in their manifesto
 unki pareshaani he waite or usase sambandhit chhapemari
 Kejriwal has tried to hurt her
 kejariwal kaa daawa he ki yah ghoshnaa patr chaar maheenon kii mehnat kaa fal he
 Obviously, when so many promises have to be made, it would take so much time
 lekin yah ghoshnaa patr padhakar ek baat to saaf lagati he ki kejariwal apane pratidwandviyon ke liye koi bhi mudda nahin chhodana chaahate or isliye unhone unke liye kuch choda hi nahin
 And so he seems to be deviating from his original intent
 unki jang bhrashtachar ke khilaaf hi shuru hui thi or us kaaran se hi vah jane gaye lekin is ghoshnaa patr main uski koi khaas charchaa nahin he
 In Delhi Aaj Tak's poll survey, it has been clearly revealed that corruption is the biggest issue here
 lekin kejariwal ek kushal raajnneetijna kii tarah is bare main zyada bolne se batch rahe hai
 They know that a class of government employees will be apprehensive by waging a talk against the corrupt
 lekin ek baat yah he ki aakhir itane saare vaade puure karne ke liye dhan kahaan se aayega? jitne vaade unhone kiye hai unhen puraa karne ke liye jitna dhan chahie vah kaise jutaya jayega, is bare main unhone chuppi saadhe rakhi he
 Delhi is a small state and has very few revenue sources and Kejriwal is also talking about reducing VAT
 aise main yah samajhnaa mushkil he ki dhan kaise jutaya jayega
 Kejriwal issued a very attractive manifesto but he shrank away from the concrete truths behind him, which would go ahead for him

 sabase pehla waar purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram ne kiya he
 Taking a dig at the RBI figures, p Chidambaram asked whether demonetisation was a plan to white out black money
 Let us tell you that the RBI revealed in the annual report that 99 per cent of Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes were returned after demonetisation
 Huh
 arabiai ne bataaya ki kul 15 lakh 44 hajaar karod ke puraane note band hue the

 According to the report, there has been a big increase in the cost of printing of notes after demonetisation
 99% notes legally exchanged! Was demonetisation a scheme designed to convert black money into white?— P

 In such a situation, the RBI should be ashamed that it supported demonetisation
 arabiai ko 16 hajaar karod rupee kaa phayda to hua par use nae noton kii chapai par 21 hajaar karod rupee kharch karnaa padaa he
 Taking a dig, p Chidambaram said that in such a situation, the economist who took this decision should get the Nobel Prize
 yahi nahin pi chidambaram ne centre par sidhaa hamalaa karte hue kaha ki jab 99 pratishat note kanoonee rup se badale gaye to kya notebandi kaledhan ko safed karne kii koi yojana thi?arabiai ne di yah reportarabiai ke mutabik vitt varsh 2016-17 main 7

 On the third day of Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi's unannounced visit to Uttar Pradesh, there was chaos in Jaunpur district on Thursday when a man came in front of his car to lie down to narrate his complaint
 aparaahn jaise hi rahul gandhi kafile ke saath jonpur ke dak bangale se nikalakar kshetra bhraman ke liye nikle, sanjay prajapati naamak ek shaks unki car ke saamne aakar let gaya
 The security personnel and district police personnel present in Rahul's security started removing him, when Rahul got down from the car and heard his problem with Prajapati
 prajapati ne rahul ko bataaya ki bhu-mafiaon ne uski jameen par kabja kar liya he
 He has come to him with a plea for justice as the local police administration has not heard the plea for a long time
 prajapati kii guhaar sunne ke baad rahul ne insaaf dilaane kaa aashwaasan dete hue kaha ki vah sthaneey congress netaaon ke jariye sthaneey prashasan ke is sambandh main baat karenge
 Later, by planting a chaupal in Lallapur village, Rahul heard the problems of the villagers and inquired about the implementation of the centrally sponsored schemes
 isse pehle unhone varanasi, chandauli, mirzapur or bhadohi jilon ke vibhinn gaanvon kaa daura kiya or chaoupaalen lagaakar graminon kii pareshaaniyaan sunin
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah addressed election rallies in Madhya Pradesh on Sunday
 is dauraan donon netaaon ne congress or gandhi parivaar par tikhaa hamalaa bolaa
 Addressing an election rally in Churhat in Madhya Pradesh, Amit Shah said that in Madhya Pradesh, the Congress has neither a leader nor a policy nor any principle
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki congress loktantric party nahin hai, jo yahaan par senapati ko chunaa jayega
 The Congress is the private limited party of the Nehru Gandhi family, whose national president is appointed, that too from the Gandhi family
 kisi duusare ko congress party kaa adhyaksh nahin banaaya jaataa he
 Let me tell you that the Congress Party has not yet announced the name of any candidate for the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh
 congress party bina mukhyamantri chehre ke chunaav maidan par utari he
 At the same time, there is still a lot of time for the Lok Sabha elections, but before that Rahul Gandhi has declared himself as the Prime Ministerial candidate
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne isi ko lekar congress or gandhi parivaar par hamalaa bolaa he
 Apart from this, PM Modi also took strong note of not announcing the Chief Ministerial candidate for the Congress party in Madhya Pradesh
 chhindwara main chunavi jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue unhone kaha ki congress ab tak apana netaa tay nahin kar pai he, to wo kaise madhya pradesh main kiye gaye vikaas ke vaadon ko puraa karegi
 He said that all the Congress leaders have their own separate government
 chhindwara aao to yahaan par kamalnath sarkaar, guna-ashokanagar jaao to vahaan sindhiya sarkaar, reva jaao to ajay singh sarkaar, bhopal main jaao to pachori sarkaar or jhabua jaao to vahaan bhuriya sarkaar
 Addressing an election public meeting in Churhat in Madhya Pradesh on Sunday, Amit Shah said, 'it is the tradition of the BJP, when we go to the polls, give account of Palpal and pie-pie
 ' unhone kaha ki congress ek aisi ATM he, jisamen samasya daalane par jawaab vikaas main nahin aata, balki jhuthe vaadon main baahar aata he or bhaajapa vikaas kaa ATM he
 There is an atmosphere of anger in India due to the wearing of radio collars on the knees of Indian students cheated by a Bogus University in America
 bharat ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki vah america se poochhega ki ek 'jaalsaaj' santhaan ko kaam karne kii anumati kaise di gai
 During the US visit of Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao next month, the issue is likely to dominate in negotiations

 "it is to be noted that two days ago Krishna sharply condemned the incident of radio callers being imposed on Indian students, calling it inhumane
 krishna kii kadi pratikriya par america adhikariyon ne unase kaha ki radio kaaler keval 12 se 18 chaatro ko lagaaya gaya he jabaki america main ek lakh se adhik bhartiya chaatr padhai karte hai
 When asked about the radio caller on Indian students, Krishna said, "there are one lakh eight thousand Indian students in America and we are now talking about 12 or 18 students who are being treated abusively
 " unhone bataaya, "main desh ke nagirikon or khaskar media se apil karuunga ki hamen vibhinn vishvavidhyalayon main adhyayan karne vaale ek lakh bhartiya chaatro ko vyapak pariprekshya main rakhkar dekhnaa he
 "let us know that out of 1555 students of Tri Valley University, 90 percent are Indian and most of them are from Andhra Pradesh
 america adhikariyon ne paise lekar chaatr visa bechney ke aarope main vishvavidhyalay par taala laga diya
 Krishna asserted, “we have raised this issue with the US at a high level
 hamaare rajdoot or san francisco sthit vaanijya duutavas bhartiya chaatro ke saath sampark main hai
 Informed sources said that this issue is also to be included prominently in the discussions during the visit of Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao to the US
 is bich, america ne california main ek bogus vishvavidhyalay ke kuch vidhyaarthiyon ke ghutane main radio kaaler pahanaae jane ko uchit bataaya he or kaha he ki america ne vija dhokhadhadi ke aaropon ko bahut gambheertha se liya he

 sarkaar ne vaada nibhaayaa bhi, kisaanon ko muaavja de diya gaya he, lekin muaavje kii raashi ko dekhakar kisaan hairat main hai
 Many farmers have been given checks of one and two rupees
 jab haryana ke kai jilon main baadh ai thi to sarkaar ne kisaanon ke jakhmon par maraham lagane ke liye muaavje kaa elaan kiya tha
 The government has also kept its promise and in 2013, the government has given compensation to the farmers as promised, but seeing the amount of compensation, the entire land has slipped under the feet of the farmers, because they are distributed by check
 Gone are those of one and two rupees
 iske liye kisaanon ko shahar jaakar account khulwaane ke liye kai sau rupee kharch bhi karne pad sakate hai
 At present, the opposition seems to be red and yellow on this issue
 ab muaavje ke mudde par raajnneetik jang shuru ho gai he
 The government has tried to take on the opposition on this issue and claimed that compensation of Rs 5500 per acre in the country has been given only in Haryana and not in any other state

 mumbai congress ne guuruuvaar ko mashhoor gayak divangat mohammad rafee ko bharat ratna se sammanit karne kii maang kii
 Congress leaders, including Vice Chairman Jayaprakash Singh, Minority Cell President Nizamuddin Rain and many activists led by City Unit President Sanjay Nirupam, paid tributes to Rafi at his tomb on Juhu Tara Marg on Thursday on the occasion of his 91st birth anniversary
 tippaniyan Nirupam said, "rafi Sahab has influenced music lovers of many generations and he was enshrined in the hearts of all Indians, who are still mesmerized by the magic of his voice
" unke asamyik nidhan ke 35 varsho ke baad aaj bhi log unke geet gunagunaate hai
 He urged the government to posthumously award the country's highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna, as a tribute to Rafi Saheb
 isse pehle mahaan gayak ke prashansak kai sanghathanon or samoohon ne vibhinn maukon par unhen bharat ratna dene kii maang kii he
 Rafi Saheb entered the Indian music industry as a playback singer in 1941 and created such a storm with his melodious songs, which still retain its magic
 55 varsh kii umr main 1980 main unki achaanak hui maut tak unhone kabhi peeche mudakar nahin dekha
 There are roads in Mumbai and Pune named after Rafi Sahab and a temple in Birmingham

 peshey se televijan patrkaar kumaar vinod kaa kavy-sankalan 'ekaranga' jab haath aayaa to sabase pehle jis cheez ne dhyaan khinchaa, vah tha is kitaab kaa chatakila cover
 Very attractive cover with pleasing painting of Anu Priya combining yellow gray, black, white and red colors
 kitaab kii dizin bhi alag thi
 Anu Priya's sketches were also inscribed on many pages inside the book
 kumaar vinod ko bataur kavi, lekhak yaa patrkaar pehle se jaanata na tha, isliye unako vyakt karne ke liye unke is sankalan 'ekaranga' ke alaava koi duusari jaankaree na thi
 The other thing that astonished the book was the role of the famous storyteller Maitreyi Pushpa on Ekranga
 maitreyi puspa multah kathakaar hai, haalanki unka 'lakeeren' naam se ek kavita-sankalan bhi aayaa tha, par vah apane ko kavita paath tak simit rakhkar apni kathavidha se tusht rahane vaali lekhika hai
 It was interesting to read the views of the creators of any kind of bondage on life's misdeeds and women on the compilation of love poems
 'ekaranga' uthaaya or ek hi baar main pard gaya
 It is a coincidence that the first poetry-collection that i had read in one sitting, was 'shri Radha', the fragment of the famous Odia poet Ramakant Rath
 krishna or radha ke prem kaa adbhut aakhyaan 'shriradha'
 Rath received the prestigious Saraswati Award for this book
 to kya 'ekaranga'
 
 maitreyi puspa ne sangrah ke bare main 'prem na baadi upjai
 
 
 Having given his talk with the title, he has given a lecture on love
 shuru se aakhri tak unki baaten kuch yon hai
 'I have poems before me
 kavita, jise main hriday kii abhivyakti maanati hum, kyonki yah kavi ke antahsthal se uthati he
 Maharishi Valmiki's poetic response to the crunch slaughter, Prasad's' intoxicating Mohamayi was a recreation; Now the heart shakes, it will be the pain of sweet love 'and Sumitra Nandan Pant's' will be the first song to be sung by the first poet Ah; Poetry will go unnoticed quietly from the nines
 
 
 
 Referring to 'she asks if the poem remains in isolation? Weren't Madhur Milan's poems written? Then she writes herself while answering, even if not union, separation is not possible
 prem donon main athaah hota he
 
 
 
 'phir is sankalan ke naam or kavitaaon kaa ullekh karte hue vah nishkarsh sa detii hai, ' aaj is duniya main jahaan nafrat kaa bolbalaa he, aadmi ghrinaa kaa shikaar he, stri doum darje par gini jaati he, aise bheeshan samay main kumaar vinod prem se bhari aawaaj lagaate hai, pyaar kii tadap se rubaru karaate hai
 And, again, this nectar of search-by-seek love is needed for the people who are burning in hate so that they can be saved like human beings
 yah mukhyatah prem ko akshunya rakhane vaala kavita sangrah, ek jaruri kitaab he
 'is that really so? For this you have to read the compilation
 'ekaranga' main 118 prishth hai
 These titles in five sections - 1
 antaheen, tumhaare rang main, bane rahane kii sambhaavna, 2
 You in the silence of the mind, 3
 auron ke liye, na hona bhi
 
 
 Live for you, 4
 mujhe tumaara sheershak nahin bananaa tha, phir bhi
 
 
 5
 ant main, tumhaara diya, ekant main kul 87 kavitaayen hai
 It took him a long time to write these poems
 diary main nots kii shakl se prakashkon tak pahunchane ke baad unhen prashansak bhi mili or aalochak bhi
 But apart from these, he went on to create
 
 
 bina kisi saakaar premika ke ek prem kavy
 'ekranga' is different from other collections in many ways
 is sankalan kii 'rahane duun benaam' kavita kii shuruaati panktiyaan hain - 'suno, ab poochne lage hai / sab tumhaara naam / poochhate hai koun he wo / jo tumhaare shabdon ke aaveg main / bahata chalaa jaataa he pani kii tarah
 
 
 'ekranga' shows many similar lines of Kumar Vinod's
 par kavi ke daawey se alag sabhi prem kavitaayen hi hon aisa nahin he
 Some poems are very good, some are common, and some are even less
 yon kisi bhi kavi kii sabhi rachanaaen ek hi str kii hon, yah sambhav nahin
 Kumar Vinod also accepts this
 par sangrah ko puraa karne kii hadabadi main unhen aise sangyojan se bachanaa chahie tha
 There are also proof-of-fact flaws
 baavjood in simaaon ke 'ekaranga' pathakon ke saath-saath aalochakon kaa dhyaan khinchne main sakasham he

 sportsperson kii itani media scrootni hoti he, logon kii taraf se parform karne kaa pressure rahata he, kaise handle karte hai aap log?sania:hamen isaki aadat pad jaati he kariyar kii shuruyaat se
 But people really react with great enthusiasm
 kai baras pehle kii baat he
 Sachin's form was going poorly
 ek akhbaar kii heading thi endulkar
 Sachin hit a century in the next match
 yahi karte rahe hai wo 24 saal se
 When he was declared finished, he retaliated
 susheel aap or sachin practice or training main bahut yakeen karte hai
 How important is preparation
 susheel:sachin ji ke jo bhi foloar hai, jo unhen pasand karte hai, wo ek sikh lete hai
 Be it the Olympics or the common man
 ek baccha, uskaa pita, uske dada, sab use pasand karte hai
 He gave 24 years to the country
 main to unase sikhta hi hum
 The rest also learn
 susheel aap or sachin foodi bhi bahut bade ho
 i remember that i interviewed you after winning your Olympic medal
 der ho gai, to khaanaa nahin mila
 You ate potato paranthas after returning home
 kaise manage karte hai fitness kii chintaa or achche se khaanaa
 Sushil: You don't eat four months before the tournament
 wet category rahati he
 So after the tournament, it seems that man now eat for a few days, otherwise a new target will be found
 sawaal- top athleates kii privet life par bhi bahut nigaah rahati he
 Is this not the case with Sachin, does it inspire
 sania:isaki bahut vajahen hai
 It is awesome if you can do it
 magar yahaan celibrity hona or vah bhi vuman celibrity bahut mushkil he
 i think many athletes' careers should go on like this
 jaisaa aapane kaha, kai baar mujhe game ke alaava duusari vajahon se khabaron main ghasita gaya
 In such a situation, it becomes more important
 unke lambey kariyar kii bhi ye ek vajah he ki unke upar staradam kaa asar nahin padaa
 Question: Why did the media not fall behind him
 nijee jivan main taank jhaank nahin kii
 
 
 Answer: Sachin's family was with him
 wif thim
 He took special care of his privacy
 iske alaava aasapaas kya ho rahaa he, usase aprabhavit rahakar vah parform karte rahe
 His stature has become something like this for the last ten years
 ki aap khud ba khud unka, unke atitude kaa, unki uplabdhiyon kaa sammaan karne lagate hai
 Question: Sushil, you guys can't relax
 kahin nite club chale gaye to media main bavaal ho jaataa he
 But if Sachin goes somewhere, everyone reacts with a lot of grace
 kya he isaki vajah or kya sandesh nikalataa he isse
 
 jawaab:sab jo bhi hai
 Follows Sachin a lot
 akhaade main bachche unka match dekhte hai
 He feels that we too should be recognized as Sachin
 sab unheen kii tarah acha bananaa chaahate hai
 Question: Our Olympic Association is banned
 sachin rajyasabha member hai
 What is your expectation from sachin politician 
 
 susheel:unako khel mantri ban janaa chahie
 It can be good sometimes
 kyonki wo sirf mere se nahin
 Who else is a sports man, a boxer, a shooter
 wo sabko ikval lekar chalate hai
 It explains a good thing
 aisa hi log hamen chahie
 They can understand
 jo bhi saport hamako chahie
 He gave 24 years to the country
 sania:sports ministar kaa to nahin pataa, magar ham sabhi ko administration main, game management main shaamil hona hi hoga
 i think Sachin should take a break for a year right now
 relax karnaa chahie
 i will do the same after leaving the game
 sawaal: susheel ye jo lahali vaala ranjai match tha
 Just tell about it, everyone was talking about it
 susheel:rohtak ko lahali ke us match kii vajah se janaa jane laga
 Now as for Sachin, i am speaking that he should be the Sports Minister
 unhen pataa he ki kya mehnat lagati he
 We have a lot of respect for CM Hooda here in Haryana
 sabhi khilaadiyon ko vah academy kholane kaa prastaav de rahe hai
 Similarly, Sachin ji is sabko saport karte hai
 Had a dream since childhood
 ki main sachin ji se miluun
 Sahara's program was in Bombay
 main unase mila, pair chhue
 Was very happy ghar main mummy papa ko bataaya
 i came here today
 maine bataaya ki main sachin ji par program ho rahaa he, to main ja rahaa hum, sabhi bahut khush the
 They all say that Sachin ji should become sports minister
 sawaal:pehle har koi sachin ke sanyas kii baat kar rahaa tha
 Now everyone is saying why are they leaving
 kyon hota he aisa
 Sania: The media should not fall behind after taking such a shower
 jab kisi kaa form kharaab he yaa koi match haara he, to use pataa he, use aapaki padtaal kii jarurat nahin he
 But this is not possible
 magar ab 500 channel hai, unhen puure din chalanaa he to kuch na kuch kahana hoga
 The need is to balance
 sawaal: susheel aap kaise is pressure ko handle karte hai
 Answer: Made me captain in the second Olympics
 puri seremani hui
 came out
 media main ek bolaa
 Why did you hold the flag maine kaha, mere liye to ye bahut garv kii baat he
 He said, whoever caught the flag, he could not bring the medal
 maine kaha, yaar ye to kamaal ho gaya
 i think preparations get medals
 is tarah ke vishwaas kaa kya matlab he
 Important is your practice and trust
 sawaal: aap log kitne andhvishwaas hai
 
 
 Sania: i don't step up on the line
 bachati hum
 Yes, we are all superstitious in some way or the other
 rafel nadal bottle ko khaas dhang se rakhte hai
 Sachin does not let anyone move
 zyaadaatar hote hai, magar apane dhang se
 Sushil: No, nothing of the sort
 aap mehnat nahin karoge, to chaahe kuch kar lo
 Will not be able to win
 mehnat to kerani hi padegi
 There is no shortcut
 boria majumdaar ne sunaaya sachin kaa ek or kissa
 About hard work
 ye unhen sachin kii patni anjali se sunaaya tha
 One day Sachin asked Anjali
 ritairement ke baad main kya karuunga
 Should i keep practicing train karte rahanaa chahie
 Anjali looked into Sachin's eye
 unhen jhatka sa laga
 What a risky thought
 anjali ne kaha, bilkul tumhaari training badastoor jari rahani chahie
 The conference audience asked the question from Sushil: You saw Sehwag
 sachin ke liye aapke man main sammaan he
 But do you have any anger about cricket? jawaab:wo bhi desh ke liye khelte hai or ham bhi
 When they won the World Cup, we were all happy
 sachin ko to main bhagwaan maanata hum
 He is the god of all sports men
 sehvaag ko main isliye pasand karata hum kyonki vah dhuandhar kheltaa he
 What will be the effect of Sachin's retirement Kasania: Cricket will continue
 viraat or rohit parform karenge
 But without Sachin, this game will change a lot
 pehle jaisaa to nahin hi rahegaa

 RSS spokesperson Ram Madhav wrote on Twitter that the comments made by Shinde in Jaipur are objectionable and derogatory
 unhone keval khed jataayaa he
 He should have apologized and condemned Pakistan's terrorists
 madhav ne kaha ki scindia ko jaipur main ek maheene pehle kii gayi tippaniyon ke liye kam se kam ‘sori’ bolnaa chahie tha
 Significantly, these comments of Shinde created a situation of confrontation between him and the Sangh Parivar and the BJP even threatened to boycott him

 It was also announced that if the Supreme Court returns the disputed land of Ayodhya to the Shia Board, they will give it to build the temple

 The BJP on Wednesday alleged that the CBI has tried to save the Prime Minister by giving a clean chit to former Railway Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal in the case of 'promotion of Railway Board Member for Money'
 party ne aarope lagaaya, ‘‘jis tarah ashvini kumaar ne pradhanmantri or pradhanmantri karyaalay ko bachaane ke liye sibiai ke halafname main badlaav kiya tha, thik usee tarah is cond main piemo kii bhoomika chhipaane ke liye bansal ko sibiai ne clin chit di he

 He said, in this case, CBI made Bansal's nephew an accused, but gave a clean chit to Bansal directly responsible for this
 sachaai saamne laane ke liye bansal ko bhi abhiyukt banane kii maang karte hue shastri ne kaha, ‘‘is puure maamle se bhaajapa kii is maang ki pradhanmantri ko istipha dena chahie, ko bal miltaa he
 He said that money was given for the promotion of the Railway Board member, both the intermediaries who are close to Bansal, became accused and the Railway Board members who were promoted are also accused, in such a situation, how the then Railway Minister

 The party alleged, "just as Ashwini Kumar had changed the affidavit of the CBI to save the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister's Office, Bansal has been given a clean chit by the CBI to hide the role of the PMO in this case
" ’’ Bansal was the railway minister when Bansal bid for the promotion of the member of the railway board and the chairman of the railway board, which is the largest post after the minister's post and the equivalent of joint secretary to the government of India, the chief opposition party spokesman Vijay Sonkar Shastri said here
 Lagi, for which crores of rupees were given
 unhone kaha, is maamle main sibiai ne bansal ke bhaanje ko to aaropee banaaya, lekin iske liye sidhe taur par jimmedaar bansal ko clinit de di
 Seeking to make Bansal also an accused for exposing the truth, Shastri said, "the bjp's demand that the Prime Minister should resign from this whole issue gets a boost
" ’’ unhone kaha ki railway board ke sadsy kii pronnati ke liye paise die gaye, donon madhyasth jinaki nazdikiyaan bansal se hai, aaropee bane or rail board ke sadsy jinaki pronnati hui, ve bhi aaropee bane hai, aisi haalat main, tatkaaleen rail mantri kaise batch sakate hai

 railway board ke nae sadsy banane sambandhi filein bhi bansal dwaara anumodith hui or uske baad ve filein piemo tak gai
 The comments unke anusaar, ‘‘agar sibiai apni chargeshit main bansal kaa naam shaamil karti to isse piemo ke bhi is ghotaale main sahabhaagi hone kii baat saamne aati or jaanch kii aanch pradhanmantri tak panhuchati
 In this way, giving a clean chit to Bansal, the CBI has once again tried to save the Prime Minister

 Law Minister said that President Ramnath Kovind has signed the Muslim Women (protection of Rights on Marriage) Second Ordinance 2019
 mangalvaar ko cabinet ne vivaadaaspad tripal talaak adhyadesh ko phir se jari karne ke liye apni manjuuri de di
 a bill banning the practice of triple talaq was passed by the Lok Sabha and the bill is currently pending in the Rajya Sabha

 This ordinance has been reissued for the third time in less than a year
 vipakshi partiyon or samudaay ke kuch netaaon ne is vidheyak par aapatti jataai he or kaha he ki apni patni ko tatkaat teen talaak dene ke baad ek aadmi ke liye jail kii avadhi kanoonee rup se asthir he
 But the government has claimed that the bill provides justice and equality to Muslim women
 isse muslim mahilaon ko nyaay or barabari kaa haq milegaa
 The ordinance has been issued for the third time in less than a year
 3 june ko vartmaan loksabhaa ke vighatan ke saath yah bill chook gaya tha
 Under the Muslim Women (protection of Rights on Marriage) Ordinance, 2019, it would be illegal to divorce through instant triple talaq and a three-year jail sentence for the husband
 chunki vidheyak ko sansadeey sweekruti nahin mil pai, isliye ek nayaa adhyadesh jari kiya gaya
 Given all the apprehensions that the proposed law might be misused, the government has included some safeguards such as adding a provision for bail for the accused before trial
 in sanshodhano ko 29 agast, 2018 ko mantrimandal dwaara manjuuri de di gai thi
 While the ordinance makes it a "non-bailable" offense, an accused can contact a magistrate even before trial to seek bail

 ) You may have read in the history books that the bicycle was invented in Germany in 1817
 lekin soshal media par in dinon daawa ye kiya ja rahaa he ki iskaa avishkaar bharat main hua
 On social media, a photo of the idol of a bicycle rider is being shared and it is being said that it is from the Panchvarnaswamy temple in Tamil Nadu
 fasebuk pej‘hindutv se badhkar koi dharm nahin"gau gita ganga or gayatri’ne 15 november ko ek photo aplod karte hue likhaa, “tamilnadu main panchvarnaswami mandir he
 There, this statue is 2000 years old, scientists believe
 jabaki cycle kaa avishkaarkarta kisi or ko maanakar shrey diya jaataa he
 Who has committed the sin of ignoring the golden history of India to make it a country of snakes and beggars? ”commenting on this post, people are writing,“ We have committed this sin
 lekin ab bharat kii samskruti ko jan jan tak pahuchaayenge”
 The archived version of this post can be viewed
 photo main ek diwaar par behad sundar nakkashi kii hui he jisamen ek shaks phool paudhon ke bich cycle chalaata nazar aa rahaa he
 The man wearing a hat also has a flower on his ear
 isi tarah kai aurfesbuk yugersane bhi yahi photo daal daawa kiya he ki yah photo tamilnadu ke panchvarnaswami mandir kii he
 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found that this photo did not actually belong to India
 viral photo indonesia ke ek dweep bali ke ek mandir kii he
 a 2000-year-old statue of a bicycle rider in a temple in Tamil Nadu was found wrong earlier
 padtaal ke liye hamane sabase pehle viral photo ko reverse search kiya to paaya ki darasal cycle savaar kaa jo photo viral he, vah bali ke ‘puraa meduve karang’ mandir kaa he
 This photo can be seen on many websites such as tripsavy and Baali Local Guide
 kiski he ye murti?internet par is mandir ke bare main or dhundhane se hamen pataa chalaa ki ye murti ek dach kalakaar kii bataai jaati he jo cycle par ghoomane ke liye 1904 main bali gaya tha
 Lonely Planet can read about it
 panchvarnaswami mandir main bhi he ek cycle savaar kii murtitamilnadu ke tiruchirapalli ke paas bhagwaan shiv kaa ek bada mandir he jise panchvarnaswami mandir ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Some reports on the Internet, such as the report of Kid Hindu, have written that there is a statue of a bicycle rider in the temple
 lekin ye murti viral post ke photo se kaaphi alag he
 The Panchavarnaswamy temple is said to have been built by the Chola dynasty
 ye bhi mana jaataa he ki 1920 ke dashak main mandir ko jab durust karne kaa kaam hua, tab cycle savaar kii murti ko banaaya gaya hoga
 Many websites such as smhoaxslayer have denied the fact that there was a statue of a cyclist in the Panchvarnaswamy temple two thousand years ago
 kab ijad hui cycle?internet par kai aisi website hai, jaise kibycycle historiaurahistory
 Comjisper clearly states that the bicycle was invented in 1817 by Carl von Dress
 bina pedal or chen ke is cycle ko sadak par khud hi daudana padataa tha
 So obviously the viral photo is not from India but from Bali in Indonesia
 cycle kaa ijad 1817 main hua tha or 2000 saal puraane mandir main cycle savaar kii murti kii baat bhi sahi nahin he

 Just think what would happen if a freak dictator gets the most powerful and most dangerous bomb in the world? a bomb that destroys any major city in the world within minutes
 uttar korea ke taanashaah ke berthde par uske vaigyanikon ne use duniya kaa ab tak kaa sabase khatarnaak hydrogen bam gift kiya he
 Isolated from the explosion: North Korea's scientists from across the globe pressed a button on Wednesday, January 6, 2016, and there was a tremendous explosion in the ground near the Pungye-ri Nuclear Center, hundreds of miles from the capital Pyongang
 dhamaakaa itnaa taqatvar tha ki puri dharti hill gai
 5 in North Korea
 1 tivrata kaa bukamp aa gaya
 Apparently this earthquake was the result of the explosion
 lihaaja bukamp ke fouran baad hi padosi desh dakshin korea or japan kii taraf se ye daawa kar diya gaya ye bukamp prakritik nahi hai balki ye uttar korea ke sanakee taanashaah kii sanak kaa nateeja he
 South Korea and Japan made this accusation and soon thereafter North Korea sealed the test of the world's most dangerous hydrogen bomb
 uttar korea ke tamaam tivi channelon par iskaa elaan kar diya gaya
 The birthday gift given to the dictator was actually a gift to a man on his 32nd birthday
 hydrogen bam kaa dhamaakaur wo bhi berth de gift ke taur par kisi or ke liye nahin, balki north korea ke taanashaah kim jong un ke liye kiya gaya tha
 Actually, this is the first time for North Korea equipped with nuclear power, when it has tested the hydrogen bomb
 achaanak kiye gaye is test se america or duniya ke tamaam mulkon ke saath-saath sanyukt raashtra sangh bhi buree tarah se hill gaya he
 Immediately after the test of the hydrogen bomb, State TV also announced the successful success of the test
 'ye north korea ke liye ek aitihaasik mauka he or is hydrogen bam ke pareekshan main puri kamyaabi ke saath hi ham advance parmaanu kshamta vaale deshon kii shrenee main shaamil ho gaye hai
 'many countries condemned, although countries like China, Japan, South Korea are extremely angry since this test
 japan or dakshin korea jaise mulkon ke saath-saath sanyukt raashtra sangh ne bhi pareekshan ke baad apatkaaleen baithak bula kar maahaul kaa nae sire se jayja lene kii shuruyaat kar di he
 At the same time, the American Geological Survey believed that immediately after the explosion, Jaljala, which came about 50 km away in the northwestern part of Kilju city, is the result of this blast
 survey kii maane to ab tak kii chaanbin main jo subut mili hai, wo ishaara karte hai ki dhamaake ke baad aayaa jaljla kudarti katai nahin tha
 Dangerous than nuclear bomb, this explosion with chain reaction fusion was dangerous, it can be gauged from the fact that it is many times more dangerous and devastating than atomic bomb
 kehane kaa matlab ye ki ek hydrogen bam kisi bhi bade shahar ko minuton main shmashaan bana saktaa he
 North Korea has also previously tested nuclear bombs three times in 2006, 2009 and 2013
 hydrogen bam suraj se bhi zyada garm he or sau parmaanu bamon se bhi zyada khatarnaak
 Just imagine from this how big will be the scope of his destruction
 Just understand that if such a hydrogen bomb falls on a big city with a population of one crore, it will not take more than a minute for the entire city to become a crematorium
 parmaanu bam ne barbaad kiye the japan ke do shahar6 or 9 agast 1945 ko japan ke do shaharon haroshima or nagasaki par hue parmaanu bamon ke ye dhamaake aaj bhi itihaas ke wo syah panne hai, jinhen yaad karne bhar se rongte khadey ho jate hai
 Then only two atomic bombs killed more than two and a quarter lakh people in these two cities of Japan
 ab jaraa sochie, us hidrogen bam kii jo in do shaharon par giraae gaye aise kisi bhi parmaanu bam se sau guna zyada shaktishaalee he
 If such a bomb is dropped on a city, what will be the result? Just understand that a hydrogen bomb can completely destroy any city with a population of crores and a half crores in minutes
 or yahi vajah he ki is vakt agar duniya main tabaahi kaa koi sabase bada saamaan maujuud he, to wo hydrogen bam hi he
 Actually, it is a kind of atomic bomb and it uses elements like du terium and tritarium like hydrogen
 parmaanuon ke fus karne se bam main dhamaakaa hota he or iske liye lagbhag 5 karod degree centegrade ke garmi kii jarurat padati he
 And this summer is even hotter than the hottest part of the sun
 jab parmaanu bam ye garmi paidaa karata he, tab jaakar hydrogen parmaanu fus hota he or isse jo garmi paidaa hoti he, wo hydrogen ko helium main tabdeel kar detii he
 Many countries have Hydrogen Bamsalas In 1922, scientists first discovered the power of hydrogen atom explosion
 iske baad 1932 main duterium naam ke baari hydrogen kaa or 1934 main tritirium naam ke duusare baari hydrogen kaa ijad kiya gaya
 Then in 1950, the US President, True Man, ordered the execution of hydrogen
 iske baad south carolina main ek bade kaarkaane kii shuruyaat kii gai
 At present, many countries including Russia, China, France are equipped with the power of hydrogen bombs
 magar uttar korea ke sanakee taanashaah ke haath main is bam kaa aana sachmuch duniya ke liye chintaa kii baat he
 Challenge for America: Due to this same craze of arms, many countries of the world ended their relationship with North Korea but did not accept that
 america, england, france jaise deshon ne kim jong ke iraadon ko rokane kii tamaam koshish kii
 But that did not matter
 ulta ab is pareekshan ke baad wo sidhe-sidhe america ko chunauti de rahaa he
 Anchor of Korea's news channel said, "we will continue our nuclear program until the US changes its aggressive attitude against us
" 'haalanki pichley saal sitambar main hi washington sthit 'institute for science and international sicurity ne north korea ke yangyon newclear complex main khatarnaak vepan develop karne kaa shaq jaahir kar diya tha
 The think tank had reported on the basis of satellite images that North Korea had developed a hydrogen bomb-making technique, and on January 6, North Korea had actually tested the hydrogen bomb

 The work of roasting the corpse by putting such an open oven in Rajtandur was still going on that the flames of the fire rising from the oven due to butter and smoke started appearing outside the restaurant

 Anaro felt that the restaurant probably caught fire
 lihaaza anaaro cheekh cheekh kar shor machaane lagi
 Anaro's scream shouted in the ears of Abdul Nazir Gunju, a Delhi Police soldier patrolling nearby
 gunju usee vakt anaaro ke paas aayaa or phir restaraan se uthati aag kii lapaton ko dekh rastaraan kii taraf daud padaa

 Who was burnt? The news of this incident, which led to the burning of Mahilaraungte, was reported to the Delhi Youth Congress leader Matlub Karim through the newspapers the next day
 tab matlub kareem saamne aakar pehali baar yah khulaasa kiya ki tandoor main jis mahila ko bhuna gaya he uskaa naam naina saahani tha
 And she was Sushil Sharma's wife
 vah matlub kareem hi tha jisane pehali baar shaq jataayaa ki naina saahani kaa katl kisi or ne nahin balki khud uske pati susheel sharma ne kiya he
 Sushil Sharma had also disappeared since the accident
 lihaaza police kaa shaq yakeen main badalane laga
 But the question was, why did Sushil Sharma kill his own wife? Obviously, the answer was with Sushil Sharma
 par susheel tab tak dilli se dur ja chukaa tha
 a phone call made Sushil Sharma's story from the leader of the Katluyath Congress to become the perpetrator of the tandoor scandal is as terrible as it is
 susheel sharma ne jis naina saahani se lav marij kii thi
 He had dumped the same Naina in the oven
 or vah bhi faqat ek telephone kol kii vajah se
 After all, whose call was that? And why did a call make Sushil mad? The manager of the restaurant was caught by Keshav police
 lekin tandoor cond kaa sach ab bhi saamne nahin aayaa tha
 The police was looking for Sushil Sharma aise pakadaa gaya tha sushilpani bivi kaa berahami se katl karne ke baad susheel sharma dilli se bhaag kar dakshin bharat pahunch chukaa tha
 He had his hair shaved
 huliya badal liya tha
 So that no one can recognize him
 magar das july ke din police ko pataa chalaa ki susheel sharma agrim jamaanat ke liye bangalore court pahunchane vaala he
 And before that Delhi Police reached there and Sushil Sharma was arrested
 patni ko shaq main maar daalaa thagiftaar ke baad susheel sharma ne tandoor cond kaa sach bataaya
 In fact, Sushil suspected that there was a relationship between his wife Naina Sahni and Matlub Karim
 naina saahani or matlub kareem ek saath kalege main padhate the
 Both were also together in the Youth Congress
 vaardaat vaali raat yani do july ko susheel sharma jab apane ghar pahunchaa to usne dekha ki naina kisi se phone par baat kar rahi thi
 On seeing Sushil, Naina disconnected the phone
 baad main susheel sharma ne jab ri-dial kiya to pataa chalaa ki wo number matlub kareem kaa hi tha
 This was followed by a quarrel between Sushil and Naina Sahni
 jhagade ke dauraan susheel sharma ne naina saahani par teen goliyaan daag deen
 a bullet hit the wall
 or baaki do goliyaan naina ke sir or gardan main ja lageen thi
 Due to which Naina died on the spot, once the DNA was done twice and the post-mortemandur scandal was the first such case in the country in which not only DNA test was done but also twice postmortem
 wo duusare postmortem kii report hi thi jisamen pataa chalaa tha ki naina kii maut jalane se nahin balki goli lagane se hui thi

 naa hi susheel sharma peshewar mujrim he
 He did this murder because of the sourness in personal relationships
 uske sudharne kii ummid abhi baaki
 Therefore, this court changes the verdict of the Delhi High Court and commits the death sentence of Sushil Sharma to life imprisonment
 taarikhasitambar 2015jagahaitihaad jail, dillisupreme court ke dakhal ke baad susheel sharma bina kisi shart ke mili perol par jail se baahar aa gaya
 This freedom of his can now become everlasting freedom
 bahut mumkin he ki ab susheel sharma waapas jail naa jaae
 Because the rest of the life sentence will be forgiven
 kyonki pehle hi vah bees saal jail main kaat chukaa he
 In addition to the holidays given to the prisoners in these twenty years, four years are made only for his leave
 yani jail niyam ke hisaab se usne 24 saal kii sazaa kaat lee he
 But Sushil Sharma's final decision to make the rest of his life imprisoned is to take Delhi's Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung

 The case was heard in the sessions court for seven years
 uske baad hai court or phir hai court se supreme court tak das saal or mukadmaa chalaa
 That means a total of 17 years
 in 17 saalon main susheel sharma ko do baar faansee mili or ek baar umr kaid
 But now he is currently free from all these punishments and has lived up to his permanent freedom

 While denying any kind of injustice in the sharing of the ministries, he said that decisions were taken in this matter with discretion and no wrong was done to anyone

 jaruri nahin ki koi aadmi kisi mahatvapurn pad ko praapt kar le tabhi desh ke liye kuch kar saktaa he
 When asked if he would not lose his identity by getting such a ministry, he said, 'I have my own identity and my ministry and department will also grow with me
 ' faruk pichley 6 saal se satta se baahar rahe hai or ab jaakar pehali baar centre sarkaar main mantri bane hai
 On this, he says, 'it was not a compulsion to come to power, but people thought that i left the field and fled, so i came back to power
 ' manmohan singh kii cabinet ke mantriyon ke pehle shapath grahan samaaroh main nahin pahunchane ke maamle main unhone kaha ki samaaroh main jaanboojhkar yaa kisi naaraazgi kii vajah se nahin aane kii baat galat he
 On the issue of Kashmiri Pandits displaced from Jammu and Kashmir, he said that the atmosphere in the valley should first be improved and then they will come back on their own
 halaat sudhar rahe hai lekin abhi itane achche nahin hue ki pandit laut saken
 On the issue of dynasty in democracy and politics, he said that children who grow up in a political family are in the blood, children understand politics

 Shiva is the god of Shambhu etc
 and the end and he has no form nor shape
 aadi or ant na hone se ling ko shiv kaa niraakaar rup mana jaataa he, jabaki unke saakaar rup main unhen bhagwaan shankar maanakar puja jaataa he
 Only Lord Shiva is worshiped in this form, only Shiva is worshiped in formless form
 ling rup main samast brahmad kaa pujan ho jaataa he kyonki ve hi samast jagat ke mul kaaran maane gaye hai
 Therefore, Shiva worships in both idol and gender forms
 'shiv' kaa arth he– 'param kalyankari' or 'ling' kaa arth he – ‘srijan’
