 When asked, the National Security Advisor did not give permission
 yahi nahin yachika main sinha ne aarope lagaaya he ki jab 20 aktubar ko dipti es pi devendra kumaar ke ghar search chal rahi thi tab sibiai ke nideshak alok verma kii taraf se search rokane kaa nirdesh aayaa
 When asked, the reply was received by the National Security Advisor asking them to do so
 aakhir yah cese kya he, iske taar kahaan tak jate hai ki is silsile main sibiai ke chaar-chaar ipies afasaron kaa kariyar daanv par laga he, rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar kaa naam aa rahaa he, unka sibiai se kya lenaa dena he, wo kyon dakhal de rahe hai, kendriya rajya mantri kaa naam aa rahaa he, abhi vidhi sachiv or cabinet sachiv kaa bhi naam aayega
 In his petition, MK Sinha has alleged that while the phone of RAW officer Samant Goyal was tapped, in a recording, Samanta is saying that the PMO, ie Prime Minister's Office, is managing the case
 jis din kii yah baatcheet he, yachikakarta ke anusaar usee raat asthana ke cese se jude sabhi jaanch adhikariyon kaa tabadalaa kar diya gaya
 CBI DIG MK Sinha has written that Asthana case complainant Sana Satish Babu met CVC Chief KV Chaudhary in the Moin Qureshi case
 11 november ko vidhi sachiv suresh chandara ne bhi satish sanaa se sampark kiya tha or ve us samay cese ko prabhavit karne kaa prayaas kar rahe the jab supreme court ne sivisi ko is maamle kii jaanch ke aadesh die the
 You will remember that when the Dubai businessman Manoj Prasad was arrested in the Asthana case, Bassi gets a call from the DCP of Special Cell, Bassi does not pick up the phone
 baad main ek anya inspector kaa phone aayaa he jo manoj kii giraftaar ke bare main poochta he or kahata he ki cabinet sachiv ne poochne ke liye kaha tha
 KV Chaudhary CVC, Suresh Chandra Law Secretary and PK Sinha Cabinet Secretary, on whose behalf these people were questioning when everything was happening in the eyes of the National Security Advisor
 kya ajit dobhaal se bhi alag koi is cese main dilchaspee le rahaa tha, kya uskaa bharosa ajit dobhaal par nahin tha, koun he wo, ek rajya mantri ke liye to yah sab nahin ho saktaa he
 Think a little more
 hamen pataa he ki yah sab aarope hai magar itane taqatvar logon ke khilaaf joint diarector manish kumaar sinha ne supreme court main yachika di he aisa kab hua he
 The most powerful person in the country, who is left now, the office of Prime Minister Modi and his minister, security advisor, cabinet secretary
 aakhir ye khel he kya
 Are we still being fooled or is there no institution left that can now bring this truth to the fore
 kanoon sachiv suresh chanda ne apni pratikriya di he, kaha he ki 'yah puri tarah se jhooth he
 i have never been to London
 main satish sanaa ko nahin jaanata or na hi rekha rani ko
 It is completely concocted
 ' Is Law Secretary Suresh Chandra really not aware of Rekha Rani, who is an IAS officer
 rekha rani ne hi satish sanaa ko phone kiya tha ki vidhi sachiv baat karnaa chaahate hai
 Gave him the London number
 usee baatcheet main kanoon sachiv ne sanaa ko bataaya ki cabinet sachiv pi ke sinha kaa messej he ki sarkaar tumhen bachaayegi lekin 13 november ko badlaav hoga
 The Law Secretary wanted to meet Sana
 vidhi sachiv ne isse inkaar kiya he or kaha he ki ve landan nahin gaye the
 But the charges are not so weak
 sibiai ke diaiji ne yachika main likhaa he ki 13 november ko vidhi sachiv ne sanaa ko phir phone kiya or rekha rani ke zarie sampark kiya tha
 So far, there has been no statement of the Minister of State nor has the BJP made any press conference on this
 congress ke randeep surajevaala ne is yachika ke sandarbh main sawaal uthaae hai
 If you read this petition, your mind will get dizzy
 jis mantri par kai karod rishwat lene ke aarope hai un par yah bhi aarope he ki ve carmik mantralay ke zarie sibiai ke afasaron ke maamle main dakhal dete hai
 All this is happening through him in the Ministry of Personnel, which is reported by the Director of CBI
 ab aap jab yah pataa karenge ki carmik mantralay jiske mantri jitendra singh hai, vahaan alok verma kise report karte hai to aap chakra jaaenge
 You know that the Supreme Court had asked the Central Vigilance Commissioner KV Chaudhary to investigate the case of Rakesh Asthana and Alok Verma
 vaise sivisi ko khud hi is maamle ko anjaam tak le janaa tha magar kair
 The role of the CVC has also been questioned in the petition by CBI joint director MK Sinha
 asthana maamle main shikayatakarta satish sanaa ne sivisi ke ve choudhary se mulaakaat kii thi
 k v then went to meet a relative of Chaudhary who has a DPS school in Hyderabad
 yah mulaakaat dilli main hui thi
 Chaudhary had asked Asthana what evidence is there against Satish Sana
 asthana ne kaha ki sanaa ke khilaaf bahut saboot nahin hai
 The question is if the role of the CVC also becomes doubtful, how can one believe that the investigation into Asthana and Alok Verma would not have been affected by any intervention
 agar sivisi ne apane rishtedaar ke saath dilli main kahin satish sanaa se mulaakaat kii thi to yah behad gambhir aarope he
 Another angle has come up in this petition
 nitin sandesra
 Dubai businessman Manoj Prasad has been arrested in the Asthana case
 us manoj prasad ne bataaya ki landan main sterling biotech ke nitin sandesra se mulaakaat kii he
 Nitin Sandesara is also a diamond trader from Gujarat
 nitin sandesra par 5300 karod rupee ke bank frod kaa aarope he
 It has a company in Vadodara, Gujarat
 agast main hi sandesra saudi bhaag gaya tha
 On 24 September 2018, the Times of India wrote that it had taken citizenship of Nigeria with which India has no extradition agreement
 25 sitambar ko yahi khabar indian express main chhapi he
 If you turn your Hindi newspaper, you will not get all these news there
 isliye diaiji em ke sinha kii yachika ko yun hi khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Nitin Sandesara ran with the entire family
 bhai bhabhi sab nigeria chale gaye
 In this case a case of cheating has been registered against former director of Andhra Bank Anoop Garg
 sandesra par aarope he isane 300 shell companiyaan banaai hai
 Through these, he has committed a fraud of 5000 crores
 ab dekhie bainkon kaa lakhon karod kis kis ne karz lekar nahin lautaaya iskaa naam bataane main kisi ko kya dikkat he
 Today, the Central Information Commissioner has pulled up the Reserve Bank of India and the Prime Minister's Office, even earlier
 magar kisi ko fark hi nahin pad rahaa he
 The comments ab aate hai media test tul kit par
 You can try this tool kit in a single day newspaper
 aap mangalvaar yani 20 november ke saare hindi akhbaar dekhiegaa
 We told you the Media Test tool-kit
 aapako teen chizein dekhni hai
 Whether this news has been put on the front page or not, the headings are common or the role of Minister of State and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval has also been prominently featured
 kya is khabar ko ek do kollam main nipta diya gaya he yaa mantri ne kisase paise liye, cabinet sachiv ne kisne ke liye phone kar poocha, vidhi sachiv ne kise phone kiya, kiske kehane par alok verma ne kiski giraftaar roki
 From which page the news has appeared, it will show how much courage is left in the newspaper, the headings will show the priority and details about the case
 hindi akhbaar bahut si aisi khabaron ko nahin chhap rahe hai
 Even if we print, we do not tell the routine type, details, so it is very important to review them like you do TV people
 balki tivi channelon ko bhi dekhie ki kya is yachika main kahi gai baton ko aap tak pahunchaaya gaya he
 The matter is also heard in the Supreme Court on 20 November
 court ne diaiji em ke sinha ko bhi haazir hone ko kaha he
 Manish Kumar Sinha was looking into several important cases in CBI
 anbhavi afasar hai
 There is a DIG in the CBI and recently he was also transferred from Delhi to Nagpur on the night of 23 October
 manish kumaar sinha ne 19 november ko supreme court main yachika daayar kar ye saare aarope lagaae hai
 An IPS officer has accused the minister of Modi government of taking bribe of several crores
 june 2018 ke pehle 15 dinon main kabhi yah paisa modi sarkaar ke mantri haribhaai parthi bhai choudhary ko diya gaya he
 The charge related to this is even more dangerous
 yah rishwat moin kuraishi cese main jaanch kar rahe adhikari vasuuli kaa racket chalaa rahe the, usee ke silsile main paisa diya gaya he
 We quickly tell you about the Moin Qureshi case
 maance vyapaaree hai moin akhtar kuraishi
 Their case has been going on for 7 years, three directors came during this but the matter did not reach the end
 2011 main upie kii sarkaar main jaanch shuru hui thi, chali gai, modi sarkaar aa gai or maamla vahiin kaa vahiin he balki is maamle ko lekar unke hi rajya mantri zad main aa gaye hai
 During this time, three directors of CBI came and went but the case of Moin Akhtar Qureshi did not reach the end
 raahat fateh ali khan moin kuraishi kii beti kii shaadi main aae the, lautate vakt airport par 56 lakh cash ke saath pakade gaye
 In the Lok Sabha elections, Prime Minister Modi also accused the Congress of this matter
 unki sarkaar aane ke teen saal baad sibiai ne cese darj kiya
 But its investigation overturned the CBI from within
 sibiai ke do-do nideshkon ke naam jaanch ke dauraan aa gaye
 And now Alok Verma and Rakesh Asthana face to face in this case
 nideshak e pi singh sibiai se ritair hokar upiessi ke member ban gaye the jahaan se inhen hataanaa padaa tha
 Satish Sana Moin was a friend of Qureshi and is also an accused in the Qureshi case
 sanaa asthana ko rishwat dene ke maamle main aaropee he
 Sana had alleged that he had given 2 crore to CBI Director Alok Verma through TDP MP CM Ramesh
 rakesh asthana sanaa ko hiraasat main lekar poochtacha karnaa chaahate the jisaki anumati alok verma ne nahin di, yah aarope he
 But when Sana recorded his statement, he said that he had given 3 crore to Rakesh Asthana in December 2017
 dubai ke vyapaaree manoj prasad or uske bhai somesh prasad ke zarie
 Based on this statement, an FIR was lodged against Asthana
 manoj prasad ko dilli main giraftaar kar liya gaya
 IPS officer Manish Kumar Sinha has accused Prime Minister Modi's minister of several crore bribes in connection with this case
 yah saamaanya nahin he ki sibiai ke diaiji ne na sirf koyala va khanan rajya mantri shri haribhaai parthi bhai choudhary par rishwat lene ke aarope lagaae balki isi maamle main pradhanmantri karyaalay or rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal par bhi baqayda likhit rup main apni yachika main aarope lagaae hai
 To interfere and influence in this case
 manish sinha ne kaha he ki jis asthana cese ko wo dekh rahe the, usase hataakar unka tabadalaa nagpur isliye kiya gaya kyonki piemo ke ishaare par shaktishaalee logon ko bachaaya ja rahaa tha
 Evidence was possible
 manish sinha neerav modi or mehul chaukasee kaa bhi cese dekh rahe the
 Has National Security Advisor Ajit Doval interfered in Asthana's investigation, preventing Asthana from raiding and confiscating his phone to save him? Manish Kumar Sinha has written in his petition that the National Security Advisor at several levels created a deadlock in the investigation against Asthana
 is cese main shaamil do midileman ajit dobhaal ke kareebi the
 It was through Dubai middle man Manoj that he was accused of giving money to Asthana, after his arrest Manoj wondered how the CBI could hold him while he was close to Ajit Doval
 uske bhai somesh or ro ke adhikari samant goyal ne ek personal cese main ajit dobhaal kii madad kii thi
 From the investigation against Asthana to the FIR level, Ajit Doval was interested
 yachika main likhaa he ki 5 aktubar ko asthana ke khilaaf exiaar hui thi jisaki soochna alok verma ne ajit dobhaal ko 17 aktubar ko di
 The question is why Alok Verma was telling Ajit Doval that an FIR has been lodged against Asthana and why Ajit Doval was telling Asthana that an FIR has been lodged against you
 kya asthana ne ajit dobhaal se guzarish kii thi ki unki giraftaar nahin honi chahie or ajit dobhaal ne asthana ko giraftaar hone se bachaa liya, yah sab yachika main likhaa gaya he, khandan se to baat nahin banegi, yah maamla ab jaanch se bhi aage kaa ho gaya he
 It has been written in the petition that under the pressure of Ajit Doval, permission was not given to search Asthana's house and his mobile phone was not confiscated
 jaanch adhikari e ke bassi ne aarope lagaae hai, em ke sinha ne apni yachika main yah sab likhaa he ki alok verma ne poochne par kaha ki rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ne cell phone zabt karne kii anumati nahin di
 a formal request was made to Alok Verma on 22 October but permission was not granted again
 poochne par bataaya ki rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ne anumati nahin di
 Not only this, in the petition, Sinha has alleged that when a search was going on at the house of Deputy SP Devendra Kumar on October 20, CBI Director Alok Verma received instructions to stop the search
 poochne par jawaab mila ki rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ne aisa karne ko kaha he
 After all, what is the case, how far does it go that the career of four CBI IPS officers is at stake in this regard, the name of National Security Advisor is coming, what do they have to do with CBI, why did they interfere? They are giving, the name of Union Minister of State is coming, now the name of Law Secretary and Cabinet Secretary will also come
 apni yachika main em ke sinha ne aarope lagaaya he ki ro ke afasar samant goyal kaa phone tap kiya gaya to ek recording main samant kah rahaa he ki is cese ko piemo yani pradhanmantri karyaalay manage kar rahaa he
 The day of the conversation, according to the petitioner, the same night all the investigating officers related to Asthana's case were transferred
 sibiai ke diaiji em ke sinha ne likhaa he ki asthana cese ke shikayatakarta sanaa satish babu ne moin kuraishi cese main sivisi chif ke ve choudhary se mulaakaat kii thi
 On November 11, Law Secretary Suresh Chandra also contacted Satish Sana and they were trying to influence the case when the Supreme Court ordered the CVC to investigate the matter
 aapako yaad hoga ki asthana maamle main dubai ke vyapaaree manoj prasad ko jab arest kiya gaya tab bassi ko special cell ke disipi se phone aata he, bassi phone nahin uthaate hai
 Later another Inspector gets a call asking about Manoj's arrest and says that the Cabinet Secretary had asked to be asked
 kevi choudhary sivisi, suresh chandara vidhi sachiv or pi ke sinha cabinet sachiv, ye log kiski taraf se poochtacha kar rahe the, jab rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar kii nazar main sab kuch ho hi rahaa tha tab
 Was anyone apart from Ajit Doval taking interest in this case, was he not confident of Ajit Doval, who is that, for a Minister of State, all this cannot happen
 aap thodaa or sochie
 We know that all these allegations are there but when Joint Director Manish Kumar Sinha has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against such powerful people
 desh ke sabase taqatvar shaks pradhanmantri modi ke karyaalay or unke mantri, suraksha salaahkaar, cabinet sachiv, koun he jo ab bachaa hua he
 After all, what is this game? kya ab bhi ham bevakoof banaae ja rahe hai yaa koi sanstha bachi hi nahin he jo ab is sach ko saamne laa sake
 Law Secretary Suresh Chanda has given his response, stating that 'this is a complete lie
 main kabhi landan nahin gaya
 i do not know Satish Sana nor Rekha Rani
 yah puri tarah se managasaint he
 ' kya vaaki kanoon sachiv suresh chandara rekha rani ko nahin jaanate hai, jo ki ek iees afasar hai
 It was Rekha Rani who called Satish Sana that the Law Secretary wanted to talk
 unka landan kaa number diya
 In the same conversation, the Law Secretary told Sana that the message of Cabinet Secretary PK Sinha is that the government will save you, but on November 13, there will be a change
 vidhi sachiv sanaa se milanaa chaahate the
 The Law Secretary has denied this and said that he did not go to London
 magar aarope itnaa bhi kamazor nahin hai
 The CBI DIG has written in the petition that on 13 November, the Law Secretary called Sana again and contacted him through Rekha Rani
 abhi tak rajya mantri kaa koi bayaan nahin aayaa he or na hi is par bijepi ne koi press conference kii he
 Randeep Surjewala of Congress has raised questions in the context of this petition
 aap is yachika ko padhenge to dimag chakkar kha jayega
 The minister, who is accused of taking bribe of several crores, is also accused of interfering in the case of CBI officers through the Ministry of Personnel
 carmik mantralay main unke zarie ye sab ho rahaa he jinhen sibiai ke nideshak report karte hai
 Now when you find out who Alok Verma reports to the Ministry of Personnel, whose minister is Jitendra Singh, you will be shocked
 aap jaanate hai ki supreme court ne kendriya satarkta ayukta ke ve choudhary ko rakesh asthana or alok verma ke maamle main jaanch kii baat kahi thi
 By the way, the CVC itself had to take the matter to its end but well
 sibiai ke sanyukt nideshak em ke sinha kii yachika main sivisi kii bhoomika par bhi sawaal uthaae gaye hai
 Satish Sana, the complainant in the Asthana case, met VC Chaudhary of the CVC
 us samay ke ve choudhary ke rishtedaar ke saath milane gaya tha jinka hyderabad main deepies skool he
 This meeting was held in Delhi
 choudhary ne asthana se poocha tha ki satish sanaa ke khilaaf kya kya saboot hai
 Asthana said that there is not much evidence against Sana
 sawaal he agar sivisi kii bhoomika bhi sandigdh ho jaae to kaise koi bharosa kare ki asthana or alok verma main jaanch kisi hastkshep se prabhavit nahin hui hogi
 If the CVC had met Satish Sana with his relative somewhere in Delhi, it is a very serious charge
 is yachika main ek or angel aa gaya he
 Nitin Sandesara
 dubai ke vyapaaree manoj prasad ko asthana maamle main giraftaar kiya he
 That Manoj Prasad told that he has met Nitin Sandesara of Sterling Biotech in London
 nitin sandesra bhi gujarat kaa ek hira vyapaaree he
 Nitin Sandesara is accused of bank fraud worth Rs 5300 crore
 gujarat ke vadodara main isaki ek company he
 Sandesara fled to Saudi in August itself
 24 sintabar 2018 ke times aaf india ne khabar likhi thi ki usne nigeria kii naagarikta le lee he jiske saath bharat kaa pratyrpan kaa qaraar nahin he
 The same news appeared in the Indian Express on 25 September
 aap apane hindi akhbaar palat kar denkhen, vahaan ye sab kuch khabar nahin milegi
 Therefore, the petition of DIG MK Sinha cannot be dismissed as such
 nitin sandesra puure khandaan ke saath bhaaga tha
 Brother-in-law all went to Nigeria
 is maamle main andhra bank ke purv nideshak anup garg ke khilaaf dhokhadhadi kaa maamla darj he
 Sandesara is accused of forming 300 shell companies
 inke zarie 5000 karod kii herapheri kii he
 Now see what is the problem of anyone telling the name of the banks, who has not returned millions of crores of loans
 aaj kendriya soochna ayukta ne reserve bank of india or pradhanmantri karyaalay kii khinchaai kii he, pehle bhi khinchaai kar chukaa he
 But no one is making any difference
 tippaniyan Now come to the Media Test Tool Kit
 ek hi din ke akhbaar main aap is tul kit ko aazamaa sakate hai
 You will see all Hindi newspapers on Tuesday i
e
 November 20
 hamane aapako media test tul-kit bataaya tha
 You have to see three things
 is khabar ko pehle panne par jagah di gai he yaa nahin, heading main saamaanya baaten hai yaa rajya mantri or rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal kii bhoomika ko bhi pramukhataa se chapa gaya he
 Has this news been dealt with in a two-column or did the Minister take money from whom, the Cabinet Secretary phoned for whom, the Law Secretary called, whom did Alok Verma stop whose arrest
 kis panne par khabar chhapi he isse pataa chalegaa ki akhbaar main kitni himmat bachi he, heading se praathamikta kaa pataa chalegaa or detail se cese ke bare main
 Hindi newspapers are not printing many such news
 chhapate bhi hai to bas routine tip, detail nahin bataate hai isliye unki samiksha bahut zaruri he jaise aap ham tivi waalon kii karte hai
 Rather, also look at the TV channels whether the things stated in this petition have been conveyed to you
 supreme court main 20 november ko bhi is maamle kii sunwaayee he
 The court has also asked DIG MK Sinha to appear
 maance vyapaaree hai moin akhtar kuraishi

 us samay ke ve choudhary ke rishtedaar ke saath milane gaya tha jinka hyderabad main deepies skool he
 This meeting was held in Delhi
 choudhary ne asthana se poocha tha ki satish sanaa ke khilaaf kya kya saboot hai
 Asthana said that there is not much evidence against Sana
 sawaal he agar sivisi kii bhoomika bhi sandigdh ho jaae to kaise koi bharosa kare ki asthana or alok verma main jaanch kisi hastkshep se prabhavit nahin hui hogi
 If the CVC had met Satish Sana with his relative somewhere in Delhi, it is a very serious charge
 is yachika main ek or angel aa gaya he
 Nitin Sandesara
 dubai ke vyapaaree manoj prasad ko asthana maamle main giraftaar kiya he
 That Manoj Prasad told that he has met Nitin Sandesara of Sterling Biotech in London
 nitin sandesra bhi gujarat kaa ek hira vyapaaree he
 Nitin Sandesara is accused of bank fraud worth Rs 5300 crore
 gujarat ke vadodara main isaki ek company he
 Sandesara fled to Saudi in August itself
 24 sintabar 2018 ke times aaf india ne khabar likhi thi ki usne nigeria kii naagarikta le lee he jiske saath bharat kaa pratyrpan kaa qaraar nahin he
 The same news appeared in the Indian Express on 25 September
 aap apane hindi akhbaar palat kar denkhen, vahaan ye sab kuch khabar nahin milegi
 Therefore, the petition of DIG MK Sinha cannot be dismissed as such
 nitin sandesra puure khandaan ke saath bhaaga tha
 Brother-in-law all went to Nigeria
 is maamle main andhra bank ke purv nideshak anup garg ke khilaaf dhokhadhadi kaa maamla darj he
 Sandesara is accused of forming 300 shell companies
 inke zarie 5000 karod kii herapheri kii he
 Now see what is the problem of anyone telling the name of the banks, who has not returned millions of crores of loans
 aaj kendriya soochna ayukta ne reserve bank of india or pradhanmantri karyaalay kii khinchaai kii he, pehle bhi khinchaai kar chukaa he
 But no one is making any difference
 tippaniyan Now come to the Media Test Tool Kit
 ek hi din ke akhbaar main aap is tul kit ko aazamaa sakate hai
 You will see all Hindi newspapers on Tuesday i
e
 November 20
 hamane aapako media test tul-kit bataaya tha
 You have to see three things
 is khabar ko pehle panne par jagah di gai he yaa nahin, heading main saamaanya baaten hai yaa rajya mantri or rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal kii bhoomika ko bhi pramukhataa se chapa gaya he
 Has this news been dealt with in a two-column or did the Minister take money from whom, the Cabinet Secretary phoned for whom, the Law Secretary called, whom did Alok Verma stop whose arrest
 kis panne par khabar chhapi he isse pataa chalegaa ki akhbaar main kitni himmat bachi he, heading se praathamikta kaa pataa chalegaa or detail se cese ke bare main
 Hindi newspapers are not printing many such news
 chhapate bhi hai to bas routine tip, detail nahin bataate hai isliye unki samiksha bahut zaruri he jaise aap ham tivi waalon kii karte hai
 Rather, also look at the TV channels whether the things stated in this petition have been conveyed to you
 supreme court main 20 november ko bhi is maamle kii sunwaayee he
 The court has also asked DIG MK Sinha to appear
 ipies afasar manish kumaar sinha ne pradhanmantri modi ke mantri par kai karod rishwat ke aarope isi cese ke silsile main lagaae hai
 It is not normal that the CBI DIG not only accused the Minister of State for Coal and Mining, Mr
 Haribhai Parthi Bhai Chaudhary for taking bribe but also accused the Prime Minister's Office and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval in their petition in writing
 Huh
 is cese main dakhal dene or prabhavit karne ke liye
 Manish Sinha has said that the Asthana case he was looking at, was removed and transferred to Nagpur because powerful people were being saved at the behest of the PMO
 sabooton se chhedchhad ho sake
 Manish Sinha was also looking into the case of Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi
 kya rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal ne asthana kii jaanch main dakhal di he, kya unhen bachaane ke liye asthana ke yahaan chhapemari se lekar phone zabt karne se roka he? manish kumaar sinha ne apni yachika main likhaa he ki asthana ke khilaaf jaanch main kai staron par rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ne gatirodh paidaa kiya
 The two middlemen involved in the case were close to Ajit Doval
 dubai ke middle main manoj ke zarie hi asthana ko paise dene kaa aarope laga tha, giraftaar ke baad manoj ne hairaani jataai thi ki use kaise sibiai pakad sakati he jabaki wo ajit dobhaal kaa kareebi he
 His brother Somesh and RAW officer Samant Goel helped Ajit Doval in a personal case
 asthana ke khilaaf jaanch se lekar exiaar ke str par ajit dobhaal dilchaspee le rahe the
 It is written in the petition that an FIR was lodged against Asthana on October 5, which was reported by Alok Verma to Ajit Doval on October 17
 sawaal he ki alok verma ajit dobhaal ko kyon bataa rahe the ki asthana ke khilaaf exiaar hui he or ajit dobhaal asthana ko kyon bataa rahe the ki tumhaare khilaaf exiaar darj hui he
 Did Asthana plead with Ajit Doval that he should not be arrested and Ajit Doval saved Asthana from being arrested, it is written in the petition, the denial will not make any difference, this matter is now further from investigation It is done
 yachika main likhaa he ki ajit dobhaal ke dabaav main asthana ke ghar search karne kii anumati nahin mili or unke mobile phone ko zabt nahin kiya gaya
 Investigating officer AK Bassi has alleged, MK Sinha has written all this in his petition that Alok Verma, on being asked, said that the National Security Advisor did not allow the confiscation of cell phones
 22 aktubar ko alok verma se aupchaarik darkhwaast kiya gaya magar phir anumati nahin mili
 When asked, the National Security Advisor did not give permission
 yahi nahin yachika main sinha ne aarope lagaaya he ki jab 20 aktubar ko dipti es pi devendra kumaar ke ghar search chal rahi thi tab sibiai ke nideshak alok verma kii taraf se search rokane kaa nirdesh aayaa
 When asked, the reply was received by the National Security Advisor asking them to do so
 aakhir yah cese kya he, iske taar kahaan tak jate hai ki is silsile main sibiai ke chaar-chaar ipies afasaron kaa kariyar daanv par laga he, rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar kaa naam aa rahaa he, unka sibiai se kya lenaa dena he, wo kyon dakhal de rahe hai, kendriya rajya mantri kaa naam aa rahaa he, abhi vidhi sachiv or cabinet sachiv kaa bhi naam aayega
 In his petition, MK Sinha has alleged that while the phone of RAW officer Samant Goyal was tapped, in a recording, Samanta is saying that the PMO, ie Prime Minister's Office, is managing the case
 jis din kii yah baatcheet he, yachikakarta ke anusaar usee raat asthana ke cese se jude sabhi jaanch adhikariyon kaa tabadalaa kar diya gaya
 CBI DIG MK Sinha has written that Asthana case complainant Sana Satish Babu met CVC Chief KV Chaudhary in the Moin Qureshi case
 11 november ko vidhi sachiv suresh chandara ne bhi satish sanaa se sampark kiya tha or ve us samay cese ko prabhavit karne kaa prayaas kar rahe the jab supreme court ne sivisi ko is maamle kii jaanch ke aadesh die the
 You will remember that when the Dubai businessman Manoj Prasad was arrested in the Asthana case, Bassi gets a call from the DCP of Special Cell, Bassi does not pick up the phone
 baad main ek anya inspector kaa phone aayaa he jo manoj kii giraftaar ke bare main poochta he or kahata he ki cabinet sachiv ne poochne ke liye kaha tha
 KV Chaudhary CVC, Suresh Chandra Law Secretary and PK Sinha Cabinet Secretary, on whose behalf these people were questioning when everything was happening in the eyes of the National Security Advisor
 kya ajit dobhaal se bhi alag koi is cese main dilchaspee le rahaa tha, kya uskaa bharosa ajit dobhaal par nahin tha, koun he wo, ek rajya mantri ke liye to yah sab nahin ho saktaa he
 Think a little more
 hamen pataa he ki yah sab aarope hai magar itane taqatvar logon ke khilaaf joint diarector manish kumaar sinha ne supreme court main yachika di he aisa kab hua he
 The most powerful person in the country, who is left now, the office of Prime Minister Modi and his minister, security advisor, cabinet secretary
 aakhir ye khel he kya
 Are we still being fooled or is there no institution left that can now bring this truth to the fore
 kanoon sachiv suresh chanda ne apni pratikriya di he, kaha he ki 'yah puri tarah se jhooth he
 i have never been to London
 main satish sanaa ko nahin jaanata or na hi rekha rani ko
 It is completely concocted
 ' Is Law Secretary Suresh Chandra really not aware of Rekha Rani, who is an IAS officer
 rekha rani ne hi satish sanaa ko phone kiya tha ki vidhi sachiv baat karnaa chaahate hai
 Gave him the London number
 usee baatcheet main kanoon sachiv ne sanaa ko bataaya ki cabinet sachiv pi ke sinha kaa messej he ki sarkaar tumhen bachaayegi lekin 13 november ko badlaav hoga
 The Law Secretary wanted to meet Sana
 vidhi sachiv ne isse inkaar kiya he or kaha he ki ve landan nahin gaye the
 But the charges are not so weak
 sibiai ke diaiji ne yachika main likhaa he ki 13 november ko vidhi sachiv ne sanaa ko phir phone kiya or rekha rani ke zarie sampark kiya tha
 So far, there has been no statement of the Minister of State nor has the BJP made any press conference on this
 congress ke randeep surajevaala ne is yachika ke sandarbh main sawaal uthaae hai
 If you read this petition, your mind will get dizzy
 jis mantri par kai karod rishwat lene ke aarope hai un par yah bhi aarope he ki ve carmik mantralay ke zarie sibiai ke afasaron ke maamle main dakhal dete hai
 All this is happening through him in the Ministry of Personnel, which is reported by the Director of CBI
 ab aap jab yah pataa karenge ki carmik mantralay jiske mantri jitendra singh hai, vahaan alok verma kise report karte hai to aap chakra jaaenge
 You know that the Supreme Court had asked the Central Vigilance Commissioner KV Chaudhary to investigate the case of Rakesh Asthana and Alok Verma
 vaise sivisi ko khud hi is maamle ko anjaam tak le janaa tha magar kair
 The role of the CVC has also been questioned in the petition by CBI joint director MK Sinha
 asthana maamle main shikayatakarta satish sanaa ne sivisi ke ve choudhary se mulaakaat kii thi
 k v then went to meet a relative of Chaudhary who has a DPS school in Hyderabad
 yah mulaakaat dilli main hui thi
 Chaudhary had asked Asthana what evidence is there against Satish Sana
 asthana ne kaha ki sanaa ke khilaaf bahut saboot nahin hai
 The question is if the role of the CVC also becomes doubtful, how can one believe that the investigation into Asthana and Alok Verma would not have been affected by any intervention
 agar sivisi ne apane rishtedaar ke saath dilli main kahin satish sanaa se mulaakaat kii thi to yah behad gambhir aarope he
 Another angle has come up in this petition
 nitin sandesra
 Dubai businessman Manoj Prasad has been arrested in the Asthana case
 us manoj prasad ne bataaya ki landan main sterling biotech ke nitin sandesra se mulaakaat kii he
 Nitin Sandesara is also a diamond trader from Gujarat
 nitin sandesra par 5300 karod rupee ke bank frod kaa aarope he
 It has a company in Vadodara, Gujarat
 agast main hi sandesra saudi bhaag gaya tha
 On 24 September 2018, the Times of India wrote that it had taken citizenship of Nigeria with which India has no extradition agreement
 25 sitambar ko yahi khabar indian express main chhapi he
 If you turn your Hindi newspaper, you will not get all these news there
 isliye diaiji em ke sinha kii yachika ko yun hi khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Nitin Sandesara ran with the entire family
 bhai bhabhi sab nigeria chale gaye
 In this case a case of cheating has been registered against former director of Andhra Bank Anoop Garg
 sandesra par aarope he isane 300 shell companiyaan banaai hai
 Through these, he has committed a fraud of 5000 crores
 ab dekhie bainkon kaa lakhon karod kis kis ne karz lekar nahin lautaaya iskaa naam bataane main kisi ko kya dikkat he
 Today, the Central Information Commissioner has pulled up the Reserve Bank of India and the Prime Minister's Office, even earlier
 magar kisi ko fark hi nahin pad rahaa he
 The comments ab aate hai media test tul kit par
 You can try this tool kit in a single day newspaper
 aap mangalvaar yani 20 november ke saare hindi akhbaar dekhiegaa
 We told you the Media Test tool-kit
 aapako teen chizein dekhni hai
 Whether this news has been put on the front page or not, the headings are common or the role of Minister of State and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval has also been prominently featured
 kya is khabar ko ek do kollam main nipta diya gaya he yaa mantri ne kisase paise liye, cabinet sachiv ne kisne ke liye phone kar poocha, vidhi sachiv ne kise phone kiya, kiske kehane par alok verma ne kiski giraftaar roki
 From which page the news has appeared, it will show how much courage is left in the newspaper, the headings will show the priority and details about the case
 hindi akhbaar bahut si aisi khabaron ko nahin chhap rahe hai
 Even if we print, we do not tell the routine type, details, so it is very important to review them like you do TV people
 balki tivi channelon ko bhi dekhie ki kya is yachika main kahi gai baton ko aap tak pahunchaaya gaya he
 The matter is also heard in the Supreme Court on 20 November
 court ne diaiji em ke sinha ko bhi haazir hone ko kaha he
 Has National Security Advisor Ajit Doval interfered in Asthana's investigation, preventing Asthana from raiding and confiscating his phone to save him? Manish Kumar Sinha has written in his petition that the National Security Advisor at several levels created a deadlock in the investigation against Asthana
 is cese main shaamil do midileman ajit dobhaal ke kareebi the
 It was through Dubai middle man Manoj that he was accused of giving money to Asthana, after his arrest Manoj wondered how the CBI could hold him while he was close to Ajit Doval
 uske bhai somesh or ro ke adhikari samant goyal ne ek personal cese main ajit dobhaal kii madad kii thi
 From the investigation against Asthana to the FIR level, Ajit Doval was interested
 yachika main likhaa he ki 5 aktubar ko asthana ke khilaaf exiaar hui thi jisaki soochna alok verma ne ajit dobhaal ko 17 aktubar ko di
 The question is why Alok Verma was telling Ajit Doval that an FIR has been lodged against Asthana and why Ajit Doval was telling Asthana that an FIR has been lodged against you
 kya asthana ne ajit dobhaal se guzarish kii thi ki unki giraftaar nahin honi chahie or ajit dobhaal ne asthana ko giraftaar hone se bachaa liya, yah sab yachika main likhaa gaya he, khandan se to baat nahin banegi, yah maamla ab jaanch se bhi aage kaa ho gaya he
 It has been written in the petition that under the pressure of Ajit Doval, permission was not given to search Asthana's house and his mobile phone was not confiscated
 jaanch adhikari e ke bassi ne aarope lagaae hai, em ke sinha ne apni yachika main yah sab likhaa he ki alok verma ne poochne par kaha ki rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ne cell phone zabt karne kii anumati nahin di
 a formal request was made to Alok Verma on 22 October but permission was not granted again
 poochne par bataaya ki rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ne anumati nahin di
 Not only this, in the petition, Sinha has alleged that when a search was going on at the house of Deputy SP Devendra Kumar on October 20, CBI Director Alok Verma received instructions to stop the search
 poochne par jawaab mila ki rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ne aisa karne ko kaha he
 After all, what is the case, how far does it go that the career of four CBI IPS officers is at stake in this regard, the name of National Security Advisor is coming, what do they have to do with CBI, why did they interfere? They are giving, the name of Union Minister of State is coming, now the name of Law Secretary and Cabinet Secretary will also come
 apni yachika main em ke sinha ne aarope lagaaya he ki ro ke afasar samant goyal kaa phone tap kiya gaya to ek recording main samant kah rahaa he ki is cese ko piemo yani pradhanmantri karyaalay manage kar rahaa he
 The day of the conversation, according to the petitioner, the same night all the investigating officers related to Asthana's case were transferred
 sibiai ke diaiji em ke sinha ne likhaa he ki asthana cese ke shikayatakarta sanaa satish babu ne moin kuraishi cese main sivisi chif ke ve choudhary se mulaakaat kii thi
 On November 11, Law Secretary Suresh Chandra also contacted Satish Sana and they were trying to influence the case when the Supreme Court ordered the CVC to investigate the matter
 aapako yaad hoga ki asthana maamle main dubai ke vyapaaree manoj prasad ko jab arest kiya gaya tab bassi ko special cell ke disipi se phone aata he, bassi phone nahin uthaate hai
 Later another Inspector gets a call asking about Manoj's arrest and says that the Cabinet Secretary had asked to be asked
 kevi choudhary sivisi, suresh chandara vidhi sachiv or pi ke sinha cabinet sachiv, ye log kiski taraf se poochtacha kar rahe the, jab rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar kii nazar main sab kuch ho hi rahaa tha tab
 Was anyone apart from Ajit Doval taking interest in this case, was he not confident of Ajit Doval, who is that, for a Minister of State, all this cannot happen
 aap thodaa or sochie
 We know that all these allegations are there but when Joint Director Manish Kumar Sinha has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against such powerful people
 desh ke sabase taqatvar shaks pradhanmantri modi ke karyaalay or unke mantri, suraksha salaahkaar, cabinet sachiv, koun he jo ab bachaa hua he
 After all, what is this game? kya ab bhi ham bevakoof banaae ja rahe hai yaa koi sanstha bachi hi nahin he jo ab is sach ko saamne laa sake
 Law Secretary Suresh Chanda has given his response, stating that 'this is a complete lie
 main kabhi landan nahin gaya
 i do not know Satish Sana nor Rekha Rani
 yah puri tarah se managasaint he
 ' kya vaaki kanoon sachiv suresh chandara rekha rani ko nahin jaanate hai, jo ki ek iees afasar hai
 It was Rekha Rani who called Satish Sana that the Law Secretary wanted to talk
 unka landan kaa number diya
 In the same conversation, the Law Secretary told Sana that the message of Cabinet Secretary PK Sinha is that the government will save you, but on November 13, there will be a change
 vidhi sachiv sanaa se milanaa chaahate the
 The Law Secretary has denied this and said that he did not go to London
 magar aarope itnaa bhi kamazor nahin hai
 The CBI DIG has written in the petition that on 13 November, the Law Secretary called Sana again and contacted him through Rekha Rani
 abhi tak rajya mantri kaa koi bayaan nahin aayaa he or na hi is par bijepi ne koi press conference kii he
 Randeep Surjewala of Congress has raised questions in the context of this petition
 aap is yachika ko padhenge to dimag chakkar kha jayega
 The minister, who is accused of taking bribe of several crores, is also accused of interfering in the case of CBI officers through the Ministry of Personnel
 carmik mantralay main unke zarie ye sab ho rahaa he jinhen sibiai ke nideshak report karte hai
 Now when you find out who Alok Verma reports to the Ministry of Personnel, whose minister is Jitendra Singh, you will be shocked
 aap jaanate hai ki supreme court ne kendriya satarkta ayukta ke ve choudhary ko rakesh asthana or alok verma ke maamle main jaanch kii baat kahi thi
 By the way, the CVC itself had to take the matter to its end but well
 sibiai ke sanyukt nideshak em ke sinha kii yachika main sivisi kii bhoomika par bhi sawaal uthaae gaye hai
 Satish Sana, the complainant in the Asthana case, met VC Chaudhary of the CVC
 us samay ke ve choudhary ke rishtedaar ke saath milane gaya tha jinka hyderabad main deepies skool he
 This meeting was held in Delhi
 choudhary ne asthana se poocha tha ki satish sanaa ke khilaaf kya kya saboot hai
 Asthana said that there is not much evidence against Sana
 sawaal he agar sivisi kii bhoomika bhi sandigdh ho jaae to kaise koi bharosa kare ki asthana or alok verma main jaanch kisi hastkshep se prabhavit nahin hui hogi
 If the CVC had met Satish Sana with his relative somewhere in Delhi, it is a very serious charge
 is yachika main ek or angel aa gaya he
 Nitin Sandesara
 dubai ke vyapaaree manoj prasad ko asthana maamle main giraftaar kiya he
 That Manoj Prasad told that he has met Nitin Sandesara of Sterling Biotech in London
 nitin sandesra bhi gujarat kaa ek hira vyapaaree he
 Nitin Sandesara is accused of bank fraud worth Rs 5300 crore
 gujarat ke vadodara main isaki ek company he
 Sandesara fled to Saudi in August itself
 24 sintabar 2018 ke times aaf india ne khabar likhi thi ki usne nigeria kii naagarikta le lee he jiske saath bharat kaa pratyrpan kaa qaraar nahin he
 The same news appeared in the Indian Express on 25 September
 aap apane hindi akhbaar palat kar denkhen, vahaan ye sab kuch khabar nahin milegi
 Therefore, the petition of DIG MK Sinha cannot be dismissed as such
 nitin sandesra puure khandaan ke saath bhaaga tha
 Brother-in-law all went to Nigeria
 is maamle main andhra bank ke purv nideshak anup garg ke khilaaf dhokhadhadi kaa maamla darj he
 Sandesara is accused of forming 300 shell companies
 inke zarie 5000 karod kii herapheri kii he
 Now see what is the problem of anyone telling the name of the banks, who has not returned millions of crores of loans
 aaj kendriya soochna ayukta ne reserve bank of india or pradhanmantri karyaalay kii khinchaai kii he, pehle bhi khinchaai kar chukaa he

 dubai ke vyapaaree manoj prasad ko asthana maamle main giraftaar kiya he
 That Manoj Prasad told that he has met Nitin Sandesara of Sterling Biotech in London
 nitin sandesra bhi gujarat kaa ek hira vyapaaree he
 Nitin Sandesara is accused of bank fraud worth Rs 5300 crore
 gujarat ke vadodara main isaki ek company he
 Sandesara fled to Saudi in August itself
 24 sintabar 2018 ke times aaf india ne khabar likhi thi ki usne nigeria kii naagarikta le lee he jiske saath bharat kaa pratyrpan kaa qaraar nahin he
 The same news appeared in the Indian Express on 25 September
 aap apane hindi akhbaar palat kar denkhen, vahaan ye sab kuch khabar nahin milegi
 Therefore, the petition of DIG MK Sinha cannot be dismissed as such
 nitin sandesra puure khandaan ke saath bhaaga tha
 Brother-in-law all went to Nigeria
 is maamle main andhra bank ke purv nideshak anup garg ke khilaaf dhokhadhadi kaa maamla darj he
 Sandesara is accused of forming 300 shell companies
 inke zarie 5000 karod kii herapheri kii he
 Now see what is the problem of anyone telling the name of the banks, who has not returned millions of crores of loans
 aaj kendriya soochna ayukta ne reserve bank of india or pradhanmantri karyaalay kii khinchaai kii he, pehle bhi khinchaai kar chukaa he
 But no one is making any difference
 tippaniyan Now come to the Media Test Tool Kit
 ek hi din ke akhbaar main aap is tul kit ko aazamaa sakate hai
 You will see all Hindi newspapers on Tuesday i
e
 November 20
 hamane aapako media test tul-kit bataaya tha
 You have to see three things
 is khabar ko pehle panne par jagah di gai he yaa nahin, heading main saamaanya baaten hai yaa rajya mantri or rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal kii bhoomika ko bhi pramukhataa se chapa gaya he
 Has this news been dealt with in a two-column or did the Minister take money from whom, the Cabinet Secretary phoned for whom, the Law Secretary called, whom did Alok Verma stop whose arrest
 kis panne par khabar chhapi he isse pataa chalegaa ki akhbaar main kitni himmat bachi he, heading se praathamikta kaa pataa chalegaa or detail se cese ke bare main
 Hindi newspapers are not printing many such news
 chhapate bhi hai to bas routine tip, detail nahin bataate hai isliye unki samiksha bahut zaruri he jaise aap ham tivi waalon kii karte hai
 Rather, also look at the TV channels whether the things stated in this petition have been conveyed to you
 supreme court main 20 november ko bhi is maamle kii sunwaayee he
 The court has also asked DIG MK Sinha to appear
 aakhir yah cese kya he, iske taar kahaan tak jate hai ki is silsile main sibiai ke chaar-chaar ipies afasaron kaa kariyar daanv par laga he, rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar kaa naam aa rahaa he, unka sibiai se kya lenaa dena he, wo kyon dakhal de rahe hai, kendriya rajya mantri kaa naam aa rahaa he, abhi vidhi sachiv or cabinet sachiv kaa bhi naam aayega
 In his petition, MK Sinha has alleged that while the phone of RAW officer Samant Goyal was tapped, in a recording, Samanta is saying that the PMO, ie Prime Minister's Office, is managing the case
 jis din kii yah baatcheet he, yachikakarta ke anusaar usee raat asthana ke cese se jude sabhi jaanch adhikariyon kaa tabadalaa kar diya gaya
 CBI DIG MK Sinha has written that Asthana case complainant Sana Satish Babu met CVC Chief KV Chaudhary in the Moin Qureshi case
 11 november ko vidhi sachiv suresh chandara ne bhi satish sanaa se sampark kiya tha or ve us samay cese ko prabhavit karne kaa prayaas kar rahe the jab supreme court ne sivisi ko is maamle kii jaanch ke aadesh die the
 You will remember that when the Dubai businessman Manoj Prasad was arrested in the Asthana case, Bassi gets a call from the DCP of Special Cell, Bassi does not pick up the phone
 baad main ek anya inspector kaa phone aayaa he jo manoj kii giraftaar ke bare main poochta he or kahata he ki cabinet sachiv ne poochne ke liye kaha tha
 KV Chaudhary CVC, Suresh Chandra Law Secretary and PK Sinha Cabinet Secretary, on whose behalf these people were questioning when everything was happening in the eyes of the National Security Advisor
 kya ajit dobhaal se bhi alag koi is cese main dilchaspee le rahaa tha, kya uskaa bharosa ajit dobhaal par nahin tha, koun he wo, ek rajya mantri ke liye to yah sab nahin ho saktaa he
 Think a little more
 hamen pataa he ki yah sab aarope hai magar itane taqatvar logon ke khilaaf joint diarector manish kumaar sinha ne supreme court main yachika di he aisa kab hua he
 The most powerful person in the country, who is left now, the office of Prime Minister Modi and his minister, security advisor, cabinet secretary
 aakhir ye khel he kya
 Are we still being fooled or is there no institution left that can now bring this truth to the fore
 kanoon sachiv suresh chanda ne apni pratikriya di he, kaha he ki 'yah puri tarah se jhooth he
 i have never been to London
 main satish sanaa ko nahin jaanata or na hi rekha rani ko
 It is completely concocted
 ' Is Law Secretary Suresh Chandra really not aware of Rekha Rani, who is an IAS officer
 rekha rani ne hi satish sanaa ko phone kiya tha ki vidhi sachiv baat karnaa chaahate hai
 Gave him the London number
 usee baatcheet main kanoon sachiv ne sanaa ko bataaya ki cabinet sachiv pi ke sinha kaa messej he ki sarkaar tumhen bachaayegi lekin 13 november ko badlaav hoga
 The Law Secretary wanted to meet Sana
 vidhi sachiv ne isse inkaar kiya he or kaha he ki ve landan nahin gaye the
 But the charges are not so weak
 sibiai ke diaiji ne yachika main likhaa he ki 13 november ko vidhi sachiv ne sanaa ko phir phone kiya or rekha rani ke zarie sampark kiya tha
 So far, there has been no statement of the Minister of State nor has the BJP made any press conference on this
 congress ke randeep surajevaala ne is yachika ke sandarbh main sawaal uthaae hai
 If you read this petition, your mind will get dizzy
 jis mantri par kai karod rishwat lene ke aarope hai un par yah bhi aarope he ki ve carmik mantralay ke zarie sibiai ke afasaron ke maamle main dakhal dete hai
 All this is happening through him in the Ministry of Personnel, which is reported by the Director of CBI
 ab aap jab yah pataa karenge ki carmik mantralay jiske mantri jitendra singh hai, vahaan alok verma kise report karte hai to aap chakra jaaenge
 You know that the Supreme Court had asked the Central Vigilance Commissioner KV Chaudhary to investigate the case of Rakesh Asthana and Alok Verma
 vaise sivisi ko khud hi is maamle ko anjaam tak le janaa tha magar kair
 The role of the CVC has also been questioned in the petition by CBI joint director MK Sinha
 asthana maamle main shikayatakarta satish sanaa ne sivisi ke ve choudhary se mulaakaat kii thi
 k v then went to meet a relative of Chaudhary who has a DPS school in Hyderabad
 yah mulaakaat dilli main hui thi
 Chaudhary had asked Asthana what evidence is there against Satish Sana
 asthana ne kaha ki sanaa ke khilaaf bahut saboot nahin hai
 The question is if the role of the CVC also becomes doubtful, how can one believe that the investigation into Asthana and Alok Verma would not have been affected by any intervention
 agar sivisi ne apane rishtedaar ke saath dilli main kahin satish sanaa se mulaakaat kii thi to yah behad gambhir aarope he
 Another angle has come up in this petition
 nitin sandesra
 Dubai businessman Manoj Prasad has been arrested in the Asthana case
 us manoj prasad ne bataaya ki landan main sterling biotech ke nitin sandesra se mulaakaat kii he
 Nitin Sandesara is also a diamond trader from Gujarat
 nitin sandesra par 5300 karod rupee ke bank frod kaa aarope he
 It has a company in Vadodara, Gujarat
 agast main hi sandesra saudi bhaag gaya tha
 On 24 September 2018, the Times of India wrote that it had taken citizenship of Nigeria with which India has no extradition agreement
 25 sitambar ko yahi khabar indian express main chhapi he
 If you turn your Hindi newspaper, you will not get all these news there
 isliye diaiji em ke sinha kii yachika ko yun hi khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Nitin Sandesara ran with the entire family
 bhai bhabhi sab nigeria chale gaye
 In this case a case of cheating has been registered against former director of Andhra Bank Anoop Garg
 sandesra par aarope he isane 300 shell companiyaan banaai hai
 Through these, he has committed a fraud of 5000 crores
 ab dekhie bainkon kaa lakhon karod kis kis ne karz lekar nahin lautaaya iskaa naam bataane main kisi ko kya dikkat he
 Today, the Central Information Commissioner has pulled up the Reserve Bank of India and the Prime Minister's Office, even earlier
 magar kisi ko fark hi nahin pad rahaa he
 The comments ab aate hai media test tul kit par
 You can try this tool kit in a single day newspaper
 aap mangalvaar yani 20 november ke saare hindi akhbaar dekhiegaa
 We told you the Media Test tool-kit
 aapako teen chizein dekhni hai
 Whether this news has been put on the front page or not, the headings are common or the role of Minister of State and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval has also been prominently featured

 From which page the news has appeared, it will show how much courage is left in the newspaper, the headings will show the priority and details about the case
 hindi akhbaar bahut si aisi khabaron ko nahin chhap rahe hai
 Even if we print, we do not tell the routine type, details, so it is very important to review them like you do TV people
 balki tivi channelon ko bhi dekhie ki kya is yachika main kahi gai baton ko aap tak pahunchaaya gaya he
 The matter is also heard in the Supreme Court on 20 November
 court ne diaiji em ke sinha ko bhi haazir hone ko kaha he

 Satish Sana, the complainant in the Asthana case, met VC Chaudhary of the CVC
 us samay ke ve choudhary ke rishtedaar ke saath milane gaya tha jinka hyderabad main deepies skool he
 This meeting was held in Delhi
 choudhary ne asthana se poocha tha ki satish sanaa ke khilaaf kya kya saboot hai
 Asthana said that there is not much evidence against Sana
 sawaal he agar sivisi kii bhoomika bhi sandigdh ho jaae to kaise koi bharosa kare ki asthana or alok verma main jaanch kisi hastkshep se prabhavit nahin hui hogi
 If the CVC had met Satish Sana with his relative somewhere in Delhi, it is a very serious charge
 is yachika main ek or angel aa gaya he
 Nitin Sandesara
 dubai ke vyapaaree manoj prasad ko asthana maamle main giraftaar kiya he
 That Manoj Prasad told that he has met Nitin Sandesara of Sterling Biotech in London
 nitin sandesra bhi gujarat kaa ek hira vyapaaree he
 Nitin Sandesara is accused of bank fraud worth Rs 5300 crore
 gujarat ke vadodara main isaki ek company he
 Sandesara fled to Saudi in August itself
 24 sintabar 2018 ke times aaf india ne khabar likhi thi ki usne nigeria kii naagarikta le lee he jiske saath bharat kaa pratyrpan kaa qaraar nahin he
 The same news appeared in the Indian Express on 25 September
 aap apane hindi akhbaar palat kar denkhen, vahaan ye sab kuch khabar nahin milegi
 Therefore, the petition of DIG MK Sinha cannot be dismissed as such
 nitin sandesra puure khandaan ke saath bhaaga tha
 Brother-in-law all went to Nigeria
 is maamle main andhra bank ke purv nideshak anup garg ke khilaaf dhokhadhadi kaa maamla darj he
 Sandesara is accused of forming 300 shell companies
 inke zarie 5000 karod kii herapheri kii he

 ek hi din ke akhbaar main aap is tul kit ko aazamaa sakate hai
 You will see all Hindi newspapers on Tuesday i
e
 November 20
 hamane aapako media test tul-kit bataaya tha
 You have to see three things
 is khabar ko pehle panne par jagah di gai he yaa nahin, heading main saamaanya baaten hai yaa rajya mantri or rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal kii bhoomika ko bhi pramukhataa se chapa gaya he
 Has this news been dealt with in a two-column or did the Minister take money from whom, the Cabinet Secretary phoned for whom, the Law Secretary called, whom did Alok Verma stop whose arrest
 kis panne par khabar chhapi he isse pataa chalegaa ki akhbaar main kitni himmat bachi he, heading se praathamikta kaa pataa chalegaa or detail se cese ke bare main
 Hindi newspapers are not printing many such news
 chhapate bhi hai to bas routine tip, detail nahin bataate hai isliye unki samiksha bahut zaruri he jaise aap ham tivi waalon kii karte hai
 Rather, also look at the TV channels whether the things stated in this petition have been conveyed to you
 supreme court main 20 november ko bhi is maamle kii sunwaayee he
 The court has also asked DIG MK Sinha to appear
 sawaal he agar sivisi kii bhoomika bhi sandigdh ho jaae to kaise koi bharosa kare ki asthana or alok verma main jaanch kisi hastkshep se prabhavit nahin hui hogi
 If the CVC had met Satish Sana with his relative somewhere in Delhi, it is a very serious charge

 Bollywood actor Rishi Kapoor has been in the news for a long time due to his 'blunt' nature, and this time he showed his flair to actress Parineeti Chopra
 DNA ko die ek intervyuu main aisa laga, jaise rishi vazan ghataane ke liye pariniti kaa mazaaq uda rahe hai
 In December last year, Parineeti came out in a new 'toned' form, for which she worked continuously for nine months
 DNA ne rishi se poocha ki vah lokapriy award sho ke bare main kya sochate hai, to unhone kaha, "mujhe yakeen hi nahin hua, jab haal hi main unhone pariniti chopra ko vajan kam karne ke liye award diya
 
 
 Can someone please give me an award for gaining weight too? 
 
 ?" intervyuu main aisa lag rahaa tha, jaise rishi pichley saal disambar main stardst award samaaroh ke dauraan pariniti ko die gaye 'style iken of da year' award kii taraf ishaara kar rahe the
 Rishi said during the interview to explain in detail the credibility of such awards, “I never believed in popular awards
 
 
 ab to ye or bhi bekaar ho gaye hai
 
 
 i use the award-winning trophies as doorstoppers by placing them under the door
 
 
 jo un logon ne film puraskaron ke saath kiya he, vah dukhad he
 
 
 Those people have made the awards extremely trivial
 
 
 besharm
 
 
 If everyone wants to please everyone, then what does the award mean

" 
 
 kya kripaya koi mujhe bhi vazan badhaane ke liye award de saktaa he
 
 
 ? "in the interview, it seemed as if Rishi was referring to the 'style Icon of the Year' award given to Parineeti during the Stardust Awards ceremony in December last year
 rishi ne aise puraskaron kii vishwasaneeyata ko lekar apni baat vistaar se samajhane ke liye intervyuu ke dauraan kaha, "maine lokapriy puraskaron main kabhi vishwaas nahin kiya

 assam main dibrugarh ke paas desh kii sabase lambii sadak or rail pul kaa kaam puraa hone ja rahaa he
 The work of this unique bridge connecting Dibrugarh to Pasighat in Arunachal Pradesh will be completed by July this year
 railway ke adhikariyon ke mutabik bogibil pul ke naam se mashhoor pul ko july tak puraa kar diya jayega
 According to railway ministry officials, the bridge will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 bataa den, bogibil pul ko puraa karne ke liye raat din kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 All the pillars of the bridge have been installed here
 ab bas ek chota sa hissaa baaki he jisko kaaphi teji se puraa kiya ja rahaa he
 The Bogibeel Bridge is special in the sense that trains will run on it and cars and trucks will also be able to run on the highway built on it
 4
 The specialty of the 94 km long Bogibeel bridge is that it is built by welding
 is tarah kaa or itnaa lanbaa rail or road pul bharat main pehla he
 According to Mahendra Singh, Chief Engineer Construction of Bogibeel Bridge, 4 by July this year
 94 kilometre lambey is pul kaa nirmaan kaary puraa ho jayega
 There is a 3 line road above India's first and second longest railway and road bridge in Asia and below it is a dual rail line
 yah pul bramhaputra ke jal str se 32 meter kii oonchai par he
 The special thing is that such technology has made the bridge connecting Sweden and Denmark
 bogibil pul kii takanic kii shreshthata kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki isko banane main denmark se takanic lee gai to vahiin isaki testing kaa kaam germany ne kiya
 Director of the Ministry of Railways, Information and Publicity, Ved Prakashbogibil is very hopeful about the bridge, saying that this bridge will prove to be a symbol of development in the Northeast
 iske alaava is ilaake main awajahi kaa ek bada upyogi saadhan banegaa
 He said that the armed forces deployed along the Chinese border will also be well supported by Bogibeel
 railway adhikariyon ke mutabik train se dibrugarh se arunachal pradesh jane ke liye vyakti ko guwahati hokar janaa hota he
 And for this, he has to cover a distance of more than 600 kilometers
 is pul ke ban jane se yah yatra kaaphi aasaan ho jaaegi
 According to the 1985 Assam Accord, the Central Government agreed to build the Bogibeel Bridge over the Brahmaputra
 iske 11 saal baad bogibil pul ko 1996 main hi manjuuri mil gai thi
 But its construction started in 2002 by the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 upie sarkaar ne 2007 main ise rashtriya pariyojna ghoshit kar diya tha
 The construction of India's longest and strategically important Bogibeel bridge connecting Assam's Dibrugarh to Pasighat in Arunachal had slowed down since 2002
 khaas baat yah he ki congress kii sarkaar ne 2009 main iskaa udghaatan karne kaa lakshya rakhaa tha, lekin yah ho na sakaa
 After the formation of Modi's government in 2014, work on the Bogibeel Bridge started rapidly and today it is in a state of completion
 bogibil pul dibrugarh shahar se 17 kilometre duuri par brahmaputra nadi par ban rahaa he
 The estimated cost of the Bogibeel bridge is 5800 crores
 is pul ke ban jane se brahmaputra ke dakshini kinare or uttari kinare par maujuud railway line aapas main jud jaaenge
 The Chalo Khowa and Moran hot railway stations on the southern side of the Brahmaputra have been completed
 vahiin duusari taraf rangiya se aane vaali railway line ko bogibil brij ke uttari hisse tak pahunchaa diya gaya he
 The station on the northern side of the Brahmaputra River is ready
 railway line bhi bich chuki he
 Tangani and Dhamal railway stations will be connected through the Bogibeel bridge
 brahmaputra nadi dibrugarh ilaake main kaaphi badi nadi he
 This river is so large that its width is measured up to kilometers here
 bogibil gaanv ke paas main brahmaputra nadi ko do tatbandhon se baandha gaya he
 The 10 km wide river is dammed and covered within 5 km
 nadi ko baandhakar is par lohe ke bade-bade tukade aapas main welding ke jariye jode gaye hai
 a large number of welding rods have been used to construct this bridge
 railway ke chif ejeeniyar construction mahendra singh ke mutabik pul ke nirmaan main takreeban 35 lakh bori cement kaa istemaal hua he
 The bridge is built on the lines of state-of-the-art Triangle Truss
 pul ko banane ke liye di ke aakaar main bade-bade khambhe daale gaye hai
 According to the railway engineer, 42 heavy pillars have been built for the bridge
 in khambhon ko brahmaputra nadi ke taale main wel foundation banaakar jamaaya gaya he
 Each pillar is inserted inside the Brahmaputra river to a depth of 65 meters
 is pul ko banane ke liye sabase behtareen cement kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 According to the project's Chief Engineer, the Bogibeel Bridge has been strengthened considerably
 vajah yah he ki brahmaputra kaa yah ilaaka bukamp ke lihaaj se sabase khatarnaak jone main aata he
 Therefore, the bridge has been made capable of withstanding more than 8 magnitudes of earthquakes
 is pul ke khambhe itane zyada majboot banaae gaye hai, jisase brahmaputra kii badi se badi baadh kaa is par thodaa bhi asar na pade
 Bogibeel's bridge is strategically important for India
 bhartiya sena or surakshabalon ko arunachal or assam ke sabhi hisson ke liye ol time connactivity dene ke liye yah pul mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaayega
 Through this, many places in Arunachal can be connected directly to the railway line
 bharat sarkaar ne pehle hi tawang ke liye railway line bichaane kaa elaan kar diya he
 In such a situation, the Bogibeel bridge will work to connect Arunachal completely to different stations of Indian Railways
 vodaphone or idia jaisi do badi companiyon ke ek ho jane ke baad bhi inaki ore se koi aisa plan nikalakar nahin aayaa he, jisase Jio kii badshahath khatm ho sake
 However, now Vodafone has introduced a new Rs 159 plan for its prepaid users
 is plan kaa muqabla airtel or jeeyo ke 149 rupee vaale plan se rahegaa
 Like Airtel, Vodafone is also giving 1GB of data per day with 28 days validity in this plan
 yani graahakon ko isamen kul 28GB data milegaa
 Apart from data, customers will also get the benefit of 100 SMS per day and unlimited voice calls during the entire validity
 duusari taraf jeeyo kii baat karen to company 28 dinon kii validity ke saath hi pratidin 1
 Provides 5GB of data
 aapako bataa den vodaphone kaa ye nayaa plan keval chuninda yugers ke liye hi valid he
 Talking in detail about this new plan of Vodafone, there will be a limit of 250 minutes per day and 1000 minutes per hour in the unlimited calling given in it
 saath hi yugers ko puri validity ke dauraan 100 se zyada unic numberon main kol karne kii anumati nahin hogi
 On the other hand, it is not the same in all circles when it comes to SMS
 yani kuch cirkilon main pratidin 100SMS diya jayega to kahin puri validity ke dauraan keval 100SMS hi milegaa
 Keep in mind that this plan of Vodafone with a validity of 28 days will be valid only for select users in all the 4G circles of Vodafone
 vodaphone kii tulana airtel ke plan se karen to sari khubiyaan lagbhag ek jaisi hai
 Talking about some differences, there is no compulsion here for unlimited calling
 saath hi company apane kuch yugers ko puri validity ko dauraan keval 1GB data hi muhaiyaa kara rahi hai

 bataa den july 2018 main centre sarkaar ne agartala airport kaa naam badalakar bir vikram maaniky kishor airport kiya tha
 Bir Vikram was the last Maharaja of Tripura
 unhone 1942 main is airport kaa nirmaan karaayaa tha

 tripura main bijepi kii sarkaar banane ke baad yah pradhanmantri kaa doosraa daura he
 PM Modi will also address a public meeting here
 purvottar ke chunavi myneagamee loksabhaa chunaav ke lihaaj se bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke liye purvottar kaaphi myne rakhata he
 There are a total of 25 seats in the Lok Sabha in eight states, which the BJP is eyeing
 tripura ko chhodkar purvottar kaa ilaaka congress kaa garh mana jaataa tha, jabaki tripura vam dal kaa majboot kila tha
 But after forming the government at the Center, the BJP aggressively launched its campaign in the Northeast, which resulted in the destruction of the fort of the Congress and the Left in the Northeast
 vartmaan main yahaan ke sabhi rajyon main bijepi yaa bijepi ke samarthan se chalane vaali sarkare hai
 This unprecedented success of BJP in the Northeast came as a shock recently when the North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) constituents formed in the Northeast on the lines of the NDA came to a stage against the Central Government in protest against the Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2016
 Be seen bataa den assam main NEDA kii ahm sahyogi assam gana parishad pehle hi sarkaar se samarthan waapas le chuki he
 At the same time, a meeting was held last month to protest against the bill in which Meghalaya Chief Minister and National People's Party (NPP) President Konrad Sangma and Mizoram Chief Minister and Mizo National Front (MNF) leader Joramthanga took part
 inke alaava is baithak main jediu ne kasee tyaagi samet nagaland kii neshnal democratic progressive party (NDPP), tripura kii indiinas pipuls frand of tripura (IPFT), sikkim kii sikkim democratic front (SDF), ke alaava arunachal pradesh, nagaland or manipur se NPP ke netaa shaamil hue the

 to vahiin krishak mukti sangram samiti samet kul 70 sanghathanon ne janvari ke maheene main vidheyak ke virodh main kaala diwas manaaya tha
 It is believed that the leader of the IPFT, bjp's ally in Tripura, can meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and submit a memorandum to him against the bill
 kya he naagarikta (sanshodhan) vidheyak 2016?darasal, is vidheyak ke madhyam se sarkaar naagarikta adhinium, 1955 main sanshodhan kar pakistan, afghanistan or bangladesh se aae hindu, sikh, buddha, jain, parsi yaa isai samudaay ke avaidh ghuspaithiyon ko bhartiya naagarikta dena chaahati he
 However, the Bill does not provide citizenship to Muslim minorities (shias and Ahmadiyas) who are victims of persecution in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh
 iske alawa is vidheyak main 11 saal tak lagaataar bharat main rahane kii shart ko kam karte hue 6 saal karne kaa bhi praavdhaan he
 According to the Citizenship Act, 1955, people entering India without a valid passport or through fake documents are classified as illegal intruders
 kyon ho rahaa he virodh?naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak, 2016 gaiyr muslimon ko bhartiya naagarikta dene kii baat karata he
 Regional parties in the Northeast are opposing the bill because they consider it to be playing with their cultural, social and linguistic identity
 jiske liye ye dal nirantar sangharsh karte aae hai
 Their other major concern is that with the introduction of the Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2016, updates related to illegal refugees or intruders identified under the NRC will not matter
 kyonki yah sabhi gaiyr-muslimon ko naagarikta dene ke uddeshy se laayaa gaya he
 Therefore, these parties believe that the Bill talks about granting citizenship on the basis of religion

 rajasthan main vidhansabha bhang kii ja chuki he
 The new assembly has not yet been formed
 congress kii sarkaar satta main aa chuki he, lekin pichhali bijepi sarkaar ke vidhansabha adhyaksh kaa chupake se bijepi vidhayakon ko bangala aavantit karne kaa ajeebogareeb maamla saamne aayaa he
 The bungalow has been allotted to about 37 mlas without a housing committee formed
 nirvaachit vidhayak puure maamle kii jaanch kii maang kar rahe hai
 Let me tell you, there has been a change of power in Rajasthan
 bijepi ke haath se sarkaar ja chuki he, lekin unke mantriyon or vidhayakon ko lagata he kam se kam apane paas bangala to rah jaaen
 Kailash Meghwal, who was the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly in the BJP government on December 16, has already allotted accommodation to 37 mlas before the new speaker was selected
 khaas baat yah he ki rajyapal ne 12 disambar ko hi vidhansabha bhang kar di thi or 17 disambar ko nai sarkaar ko shapath bhi dilaa di, lekin ek din pehle yani 16 disambar ko bijepi ke vidhansabha adhyaksh or maujuuda vidhayak kailash meghavaal ne bijepi vidhayakon or mantriyon ko bangala aavantit kar diya
 The matter came to light when the bungalow of Hanuman Beniwal, the president of the National Democratic Party and three-time MLA from Khivansar, was also allotted to someone else
 is maamle ke saamne aane ke baad hanuman beniwal ne kaha ki isaki jaanch honi chahie
 The speaker has improperly allocated accommodations
 vahiin, ajmer se vidhayak or vasundhara sarkaar main mahila kalyaan mantri raheen anita bhadel maamle par kuch bhi kehane se bachati dikhin
 Though the Congress mlas heard that the bungalow is being divided, they too reached out to the BJP MLA and Speaker Meghnath to apply
 vidhayakon kaa kahana he ki kai baar vaastu or lokation kii chintaa rahati he, isliye chaahate hai ki pasandida bangala mil jaae
 On the other hand, Kailash Meghwal said that i am a speaker right now
 jab tak nayaa spikar nahin chunaa jaataa mere paas vidhansabha kii sarvocch shaktiyaan hai or mujhe apni shakti kaa prayog karne se rajyapal or mukhyamantri bhi nahin roak sakate hai
 Actually, according to the rule, after the formation of the Vidhan Sabha, a Housing Committee is formed and the Housing Committee allots the accommodation of the MLA and the ministers
 spikar kii ore jin 37 vidhayakon ko bangala aavantit kiya gaya he, unamem 20 vidhayak bijepi ke hai, paanch nirdaleey hai to 12 congress ke bhi hai
 Earlier, after the elections on December 7, Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje had also allotted her 13 Reliance bungalow once again in her name

 pakistan main rah rahe mumbai hamalon ke mastermind or jamaat-ud-daawa ke pramukh hafiz said se poochtacha karnaa chaah rahi sanyukt raashtra kii ek team kaa vija anurodh pakistan ne thukraa diya he
 The team wanted to interrogate the jamaat-ud-dawa chief in Pakistan in connection with an application filed by Saeed to remove his name from the UN Security Council ban list
 sanyukt raashtra ke sutron ne is baat kii jaankaree disamyukt raashtra dwaara pratibandhit jamaat-ud-daawa ke mukhiya hafiz said par chautarafa dabaav daalane ke baad sanyukt raashtra ne 10 disambar 2008 ko sanyukt raashtra ne us par pabandi laga di thi
 Let us know that 166 people were killed in the 26 / 11 Mumbai attack
 jiske baad bharat ne antakawaad ke khilaaf vaishvik str par jang chhedi thi
 India was continuously pressurizing the UN to ban Hafiz Saeed and terrorist organizations operating in Pakistan
 is ladaai main bharat ko kai deshon kaa samarthan bhi mila tha
 Terrorist Hafiz Saeed was banned by the UN Security Council after the Mumbai attacks
 lekin november 2017 ko pakistan main use najarbandi se reeha kar diya gaya tha
 UN sources told PTI that a representative of Pakistan's Permanent Mission to the United Nations had informed the UN Ombudsman in October last year that no visa would be issued for his visit to Pakistan

 Honorable prisoners in jails on various charges in Uttar Pradesh have now wished to stay in jails of their area
 unki isi hasarat ko dekhte hue sarkaar bhi is disha main aage badhane kaa man bana rahi he
 The question of lacquer is that to what extent are the demands of sending the domineering and Bahubali mlas in the jails of their area jails on charges of serious charges like murder and rape and to give them pleasurable facilities? During the stay in jails, the accused mlas are required to show their gratitude, make full use of their money-force and network and consume all kinds of facilities
 Complete discounts are available
 apane jile kii jail main pahunchane ke peeche unke tamaam tarah ke hit jude hote hai
 During the ongoing Vidhan Sabha session in Uttar Pradesh, it was demanded that the accused mps and mlas should be given special status in the jails till the blame is proved and kept them in the jails located in their constituencies
 Arrange to go is bich pradesh ke jail mantri raghuraaj pratap singh urf raja bhaiya ne bhi kaha ki sarkaar is maang par vichaar kar sakati he
 The question arises that why the government is going to give such special attention to the legislators who are lodged in jails on serious charges
 jelon ke bheetar vishesh suvidhaon kii maang karnaa kahaan tak jaij he?uttar pradesh main vidhayak kii hatya se lekar tamaam tarah ke sangeen aaropon main kai vidhayak vibhinn jelon main band hai
 Should he be provided a lot of facilities in jails because he is a public representative
 janpratinidhiyon ke saath ek aam kaidi kii tarah vyavhaar kyon nahin kiya ja saktaa he?vidhansabha main had to tab ho gai jab karagaar mantri raja bhaiya ne agra kii jail main band nirdaleey vidhayak mukhtaar ansaari ko unke ilaake kii jail dilwane ke liye mukhyamantri se guhaar lagane tak kaa aashwaasan de diya
 Pramod Tiwari, a senior Congress leader in the assembly, had questioned through the demand that the prisons were torture homes during the British era, but are now considered to be reform houses
 nyaay kaa yahi naiysargik siddhant he ki jab tak dosha sabit na ho jaataa tab tak kisi ko doshi nahin mana jaataa
 Many mps and mlas are also kept in jails in various cases and later they are proved innocent by the court
 uttar pradesh ke purv police mahanideshak ishwar chandra dvivedi ne baatcheet main kaha ki aisi baaten isliye uthaai ja rahi hai taaki apane bhavishya ke liye jameen taiyaar kii ja sake
 Dwivedi says very clearly that the time has come for the right to information
 soochna ke adhikaar kaa prayog kar log tamaam tarah kii jaankariyaan hasil kar rahe hai
 That is why the pressure on public representatives has increased
 ab koi mafia yadi banaras se judaa he or use kai sau kilometre dur le jaakar duusari jail main band kar diya jaae to nishchit taur par uskaa network prabhavit hota he
 Dwivedi said that the intention behind this is clearly that such measures should be taken and changes in the law should be made so that if there is any kind of problem in future, it can be taken advantage of
 kehete hai pyaar andhaa hota he or aksar pyaar main pade log jati, dharm, bhashaa, amiri-garibi yaa umr jaisi simaaon ko nahin maanate

 pichley saal rangana herath kii behtareen gendbaaji kii madad se srilanka team ne australia team ko 3-0 se apni sarajameen par haraaya tha
 Seeing the Sri Lankan team adorned with youth, it was once felt that they are progressing in the right direction by making a good improvement in their cricket
 lekin baad main yah bhram sabit hua
 He suffered a crushing defeat in South Africa and even lost a Test to Bangladesh at home
 durgati jari rahi
 Last month, he was also seen in front of a very low team in the rankings like Zimbabwe and now Team India has defeated him 3–0
 maujuuda srilanka team ranjai team se bhi kamjorsunil gavaskar jo is samay export ke rup main srilanka main hai, unhone mejabaan team ko unke kharaab pradarshan ke liye bahut jhaada
 He said, to be honest, you cannot call it a test match
 bhartiya team ko bilkul bhi test nahin kiya gaya
 This Sri Lankan team will be seen battling in front of any Ranji team
 gavaskar ne ummid kii ki srilanka team apni galatiyon se seekhegi or apane khel ko behatar banaaegi
 This defeat will have a profound impact in the ranking of Sri Lanka Teak
 gavaskar puri tarah se galat nahin he, kyonki aajkal ranjai timen bhi behtareen cricket khel rahi hai
 The Sri Lankan team, suffering from injuries, showed little power against the Indian team
 iske alaava ve har satr main bhartiya team ke saamne apane hathiyaar daalate najar aae
 Sri Lanka could have lost the innings in the first Test as well
 Let us tell you that Sri Lanka had to face defeat in two consecutive innings at the hands of India
 ye teesri pari se haar bhi ho sakati thi
 If Virat Kohli would have fed Sri Lanka in the first Test match
 sabase kharaab pallekele test main hua
 Where the Sri Lankan team surrendered within three days
 haar kaa khatra unpar tabhi se mandaraane laga tha jab ve pehali pari main bharat ke 487 ranon ke jawaab main 135 ranon par olout ho gaye the
 Team India finally won the match by 1 innings and 171 runs

 India's largest defense deal in the world may be recorded as perhaps the slowest advancing deal in history
 bharat ne apane budhaate mig-21 vimaanon ke bede ko badalane ke liye 11 saal kii behad thakaaoo chayan prakriya ke baad do saal pehle france ke rafel jangi jet kaa sauda karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 But now the German-led European alliance, which is second in the race for the selection process, has given the competition a fresh treat by offering a cheaper rate Eurofighter Typhoon
 india today ko sutron ke hawaale se pataa chalaa he ki modi sarkaar germany kii peshkash par gaur kar rahi he jabaki hindustan aironautics limited (echeel) rafel kii nirmaataa france kii dasalt company se bharat main vimaan nirmaan ke samjhaute ko antim rup dene main lagi he
 The estimated price of Rafale's deal for 126 jets is 20 billion euros (1
 6 lakh karod ru
 ), Which has to be paid throughout the decade
 centre main bijepi sarkaar ke satta sanbhaalane ke kuch hafton ke bheetar hi german sarkaar ke pratinidhiyon ne nai peshkash ke saath baatcheet shuru kii, taaki france kaa sauda gadabada jaae
 20,000 crore over a ten-year period from the new offering
 tak ghat sakati he
 According to sources, 'shiyyat' is so strong that there has been a stir in the upper circles of the government
 nai aupchaarik peshkash july ke shuru main raksha mantri arun jetali se kii gai
 Later Prime Minister Narendra Modi was made aware of this
 is nai peshkash kii kul maujuuda keemat (agar maujuuda keemat par puure bede kii anumaanit keemat aanki jaae) 10
 It sits just over 5 billion euros while the French deal costs more than one billion euros
 company kii tay keemat ke aadhaar par gananaa karne par (yaa das saal main di jane vaali rakam) germany kii keemat 17
 Sits 5 billion euros
 2012 main mana ja rahaa tha ki eurofiter kii keemat 21 arab euro se zyada he
 Because of this, France reached the front in the race
 tab se dasalt or echeel ke bich jangi jet ke saz-utpaadan ke liye baatcheet kaa lanbaa daur chalata rahaa he
 Now that the technical and commercial negotiations between the two have reached the final stages, the deal itself seems to be in a dilemma
 german peshkash eurofiter ke nirmaataa airbas dephence and spes kii ore se ai he
 However, there is no scope for revision of prices in the procurement rules of the Ministry of Defense
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki germany kii riyaayat kii maatra itani badi he ki sarkaar france kii keemat par nae sire se vichaar karne ko prerit ho sakati he
 This offering is probably the result of heavy diplomatic outcry among large European forces
 germany kii aguai vaale gathjod ke in europea deshon kii dilchaspee saude kii baari rakam or isse unke yahaan rojgaar srijan kii sambhaavna ke kaaran badi he
 The possibility of renegotiating the deal came to light when Germany's Ambassador to India Michael Steiner met top leaders of the BJP government in early June
 unhen pataa chalaa tha ki nai sarkaar upie sarkaar ke samjhaute ko manjuur karne ke badale saude ke nae sire se moolyankan par vichaar kar rahi he to germany ne apane sahyogi deshon britain, spain or italy se nai peshkash ke bare main salaah kii
 Four days before the new offer reached the central government, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius met Indian leaders in New Delhi
 francisi paksh ko saude ke prati bharat kaa dhulmul ravaiya dekh niraashaa hui thi
 a few days before the offer, on June 24, Jaitley said in his first comment on the Rafale deal that the government would "take a conscious decision" on the deal
 yah upie sarkaar ke us rukh se bhinn tha ki francisi paksh ke saath baatcheet antim daur main he
 It is believed that one of the reasons for the Raphael deal not moving fast
 ke
 Antony hesitated
 ve bhartiya vaayu sena kii vivaadaaspad mulya gananaa se shaayad sahamat nahin the jo mudrasphiti kaa akalan apni anumaanit daron se kar rahi thi or use francisi sauda sasta lag rahaa tha
 The deal's competitors allege that the French commercial offering is 'incomplete' and that the Indian side is pricing the data from Dassault's data, which India's financial experts should investigate
 jaankaron kii maane to saude par punarvichaar ke praavdhaanon ke abhaav main eurofiter ke dobaaraa spardhaa main lautne kii sambhaavna mushkil hogi
 Amit Kaushish, former Financial Advisor (acquisition) at the Ministry of Defense and an expert at the Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis, says, "I don't see any procedural or political possibilities of change
" sarkaar jo chaahe kar sakati he lekin na to yah vyaavhaarik hoga, na samajhdaari bharaa
 It may be difficult and shocking for the government to make the French wait for two years and negotiate a deal with someone else
 ”chunki france ne is saude ke liye bade paimaane par rajnatik pahal kii thi, isliye bharat ko uskaa dabaav jhelana pad saktaa he
 France is the third largest country in supplying defense equipment to India
 uske saath bade saudon main scorpine pandubbi or miraj 2000 ke bede ko apgrade karne ke saude hai
 But Germany's new offering may create uncertainty about medium-range multicolored warfare aircraft (MMRCA)
 rafel saude kaa yahi takneekee naam he
 But this is not good news for the Indian Air Force as the project is two years behind schedule and is being replaced by both Russia's fifth generation fighter aircraft (FGFA) and indigenous light fighter aircraft (LCA)
 
 jaahir he, behad oonche saude kii kahani main mode aa gaya he lekin bharat ke hit main yahi hoga ki sarkari letlatifi ke chakkar main vaayu sena ke aadhunikeekaran kii prakriya or lambit na ho

 These operators were allegedly benefitted in the 2G spectrum allocation scam
 ji es singhvi or e ke ganguli kii khandpeeth ne sabhi sambandhit companiyon, sarkaar or yachikakartaon kaa paksh sunne ke baad apni karrwai ko khatm kiya
 The joint public interest litigation filed by several civil society groups alleged that the Department of Telecommunications had 'many legal wrongs, corruption and bias' while allocating spectrum while Raja was Telecom Minister
 ’yachikakartaon main telecom vachdog, kaaman coj, purv mukhya chunaav ayukta je em lingadoh, tii es krishnamurthi or en gopalaswami or purv satarkta ayukta pi shankar shaamil hai
 The petitioners also stated that TRAI recommended the cancellation of 69 out of 122 licenses as they could not commence service within the stipulated time frame as per the license granting conditions
 isse pehle peeth ne 11 nijee doorsanchaar companiyon ko notice jari kiya tha jinhen kathith taur par ayogy hone ke baavjood license diya gaya tha yaa nishchit samay seemaa ke andar ve seva shuru karne main vifal rahe
 Private telecom companies to whom notices were issued include Etisalat Uninor, Loop Telecom, Videocon, s Tel, Allianz Infra, Idea Cellular, Tata Teleservices, Sistema Shyam Teleservices, Dishnet Wireless, Vodafone Essar as well as TRAI
 2ji aavanton ghotaale se phaayde main rahane vaali doorsanchaar companiyon ne spectrum aavanton main kisi tarah kii avaidhta se inkaar kiya or ucchtam nyaayalay se kaha ki agar raja ke kaarykaal main pehle aao pehle paao niti ko avaidh mana jaataa he to varsh 2003 se sabhi aavantnon ko nirast kiya jaye
 The court hearing in the case virtually took the form of a fight with older service providers who argued that the spectrum allocated to them is valid and should not be compared with new companies whose licenses are under judicial surveillance

 punjab neshnal bank mahaghotaale ke maamle main sibiai or pravartan nideshaalay ne teji se jaanch shuru kar di he
 New layers of this case are being opened

 The negligence of other banks also pointed out that this was not possible according to the rules
 malik ne kaha ki jab exis bank or elahabaad bank samet anya bainkon ke paas yah 1 saal kaa lou pahunchaa hoga, to unke kaan apneaap khadey ho jane chahie the
 Questions should have started arising in his mind that from where the bank guarantee of the last 1 year has come
 lekin aisa kuch nahin hua or isaki taraf dhyaan nahin diya gaya
 Malik expressed the apprehension that not only the employees of PNB, but also employees of other banks could be involved in this case

 How did the RBI miss out? Malik raised many questions about the case

 How much money the client has taken from the rest of the banks

 Is there a defaulter somewhere? is system main aisa hota he ki agar koi cheez limit se baahar ho, to SWIFT us par ection hi nahin legi

 The talk of world war on water is not new anymore
 sunne main jarur atpati lagati hai, lekin hakeekat or halaat kaa ishaara kuch yahi he
 For this reason, it would be meaningless to ignore the World Bank report which says that due to climate change and the current habit of wildly exploiting water, 60 percent of the current water resources around the country will soon dry up

 On this, Amarinder quipped that i did not see such an unworthy defense minister

 There should be no politics on surgical strikes, Amarinder said, while targeting the BJP that governments and parties did not do politics on such matters earlier

 Haryana itself is an unprecedented victory: PM thanks the blessings we have received, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed party workers at BJP headquarters in Delhi on Thursday evening
 unhone haryana or maharashtra main bijepi ko bade dal ke rup main jeet darj karne par badhai di or kaha ki donon rajyon main mukhyamantri nae the, iske baavjood donon kaa jeet kar aana party ke liye garv kii baat he
 The Prime Minister said, Devendra Fadnavis in Maharashtra and Manohar Lal Khattar in Haryana had their first experience, the two leaders never even served as ministers in any government
 maharashtra main pichhali baar bijepi ko purna bahumat bhi nahin mila or haryana main bahumat se maatr do siten zyada thim
 Despite this, both the leaders did a lot of work in their own state, which resulted in the public reposing faith in the BJP
 piem modi ne kaha, diwali aarambh hone se purv hiharyanaor maharashtra ke logon ne hamaari party ke prati jo vishwaas jataayaa he, hamen jo aashirwad diya he, uske liye dhanyavad detaa hum
 The Prime Minister said that in Maharashtra in the last 50 years, not a single Chief Minister has been able to serve for 5 consecutive years
 5 varsh tak mukhyamantri ke rup main lagaataar kaary karne kaa kaam 50 varsh baad devendra fadanvis ne kiya
 Those who know the politics of Haryana know that if we had to compromise with any party, then mostly on the term and condition of those parties, sometimes 5 or 10 seats and whatever they say had to fight in those seats
 
 2014 ke pehle tak ye hamaari sthiti thi, waisi sthiti main se jis prakaar se hamaari nai team ko paanch saal wo bhi sirf do kaa bahumat tha
 Despite all this, coming back to work for five years is as low as the number of congratulations to the Haryana KBJP

 Jayaprakash Dashora, a resident of Chittorgarh, says that the government should take drastic steps to save this historic building
 lekin mudde ke rajasthan vidhansabha main uthne ke baad rajasthan sarkaar ab satark ho gai he
 Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has said that every effort will be made to avoid the fort
 enditivi se baatcheet main mantri rajendra rathore ne bataaya ki khanan patton kii samiksha kii jaaegi or durg ke punarvaas ke liye yojana banegi
 He said, 'the Chief Minister has assured in the House that the fort of Chittorgarh will not only be preserved but in view of its archaeological importance, the government will actively cooperate to fix it further
 purvavarti sarkaar dwaara durg ke aas-paas jo khanan patte jari hue hai unki bhi samiksha hogi
 But the question is that in 2013, when the Rajasthan High Court ordered a ban on mining within 10 km radius of the fort, how did the work of limestone mining continue under the government's nose by blasting here? hindu reeti se hone vaali shaadi-byaah main mandap sabase ahm hota he
 The pavilion is not merely a thatch covered with mango leaves, with which the deities are invoked and invoked
 devtaa nae jivan main pravesh karne vaale var-vadhoo ko apana aashirwad dete hai or unke vaivaahik bandhan ke sakshi banate hai
 Now, as the traditions have become modernized in the era of change, the impact on the pavilion is also being seen
 isi aupchaarikta ke chalate ab radimaid mandap kii maang bad gai he
 a person who has become a part of high-tech and bhagam-bhaag life, has now started incorporating rituals in his own style
 dharmik reeti-rivaajon ke mutabik shaadi kii rasmon kii shuruyaat mandap se hoti he
 For this, the priests decide the day and time
 uchit samay par gaade gaye mandap shaadi hone ke baad shubh muhoort main sasamman visarjeet hote hai
 It is believed that on the auspicious occasion of marriage, all the gods reside under the pavilion on the call of the priest and open the doors of a happy married life for the married couple
 ek vakt tha, jab kanyapaksh ke bich mandap ko lekar behad utsakutaa or jimmedaari kaa bhav rahata tha
 The pavilion was so decorated that the elders of the house used to prepare for it
 aisi manyataayen samaaj main shuru se maani ja rahi hai
 But the effect of the change that has come with time is that today people have prepared the second formula of the pavilion
 badhati aabaadi, sikudte makaan or simit jagahon ke kaaran mandap kahin marij haul ke kisi kone main redimaid tareeke se khadaa kiya ja rahaa he, to kahin khule maidan main aisi jagah mandap banaaya ja rahaa he, jahaan sirf var-vadhoo paksh ke simit log hi maujuud rah saken or baaki jagah shaadi kii duusari vyavasthaaon, stage or cataring ke liye istemaal kii ja rahi he
 Actually, the pavilion is now being left behind and all the charm of the wedding is being reduced to 'jaymal' and DJ
 vahiin pheron ke liye ab mandap aupchaarikta bhar rah gaya he
 Along with other wedding arrangements, the tents are also entrusted with the task of the pavilion, the artisans of which get ready to walk the pavilion in minutes
 shaadi ke baaki intjaamon ko lekar bhale hi kanya paksh ko chintaa ho, lekin aamtaur par mandap ab chintaa kaa vishay nahin banataa
 At the same time, in the ceremonies of dowry-free marriages, hundreds of pavilions are asked for wholesale price and all the pavilions rise after the marriage ends
 paramparaon se ho rahe khilwaad par pan
 Krishnadeva Shukla says that people are forgetting the importance of the mandap and are inadvertently messing with religious traditions
 isse vaivaahik jivan main dushwariyaan aa sakati hai, lekin ativyast jivan style main samayabhaav ke kaaran log vikalp talashne lage hai
 According to Shukla, the use of readymade pavilions is not conventionally appropriate
 khaastaur se jaise-jaise iskaa vyavsaayeekaran ho rahaa he, vaise-vaise parampaparaayen peeche chhootati ja rahi hai or mandap bhi khanaapurti kaa hissaa banate ja rahe hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party has been facing many questions since the Shunglu Committee report surfaced during the MCD elections in Delhi
 aise main party ko report ke aadhaar par media main ho rahe khulaason par safai deni pad rahi he
 In this case, an issue has also arisen regarding the catering bill
 bijepi ne kuch katering bill media main jari kar daawa kiya ki arvind kejariwal ne 11 or 12 farvari 2016 ko apane ghar main party di thi, usamen jo khaanaa khilaayaa gaya tha wo kareeb 12000 rupee prati plate kaa tha
 This party was given by Arvind Kejriwal to mark the completion of one year of his government
 jo do din ke khaane kaa puraa bill he wo he taqariban 11 lakh rupee kaa he
 BJP has alleged that Aam Aadmi Party is wasting public money

 Modi's rally was postponed and his power test with Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was also postponed
 dilli main isi din nitish adhikaar raily karne vaale hai
 There was a lot of media speculation about both the rallies
 to kya shakti pareekshan taalane ke liye modi ne mumbai main raily naa karne kaa faisla liya?party ke mutabik maharashthr main sookhe kii sthiti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue modi ne raily taal di he lekin siyaasi atakalein yaheen he ki nitish se takaraav taalane ke liye modi kii raily tali he
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has resigned
 loksabhaa chunaav main apni party jediu ke behad kharaab pradarshan ke baad nitish kumaar ne siem pad se istipha de diya
 The Chief Secretary of the Bihar government has confirmed the news of Nitish Kumar's resignation
 nitish ne rajyapal dow
 DY Patil has submitted his resignation
 khabar yah bhi he ki nitish kumaar ne rajyapal se vidhansabha bhang karne kii sifarish kii he
 Significantly, in the results of the Lok Sabha elections on Friday, the performance of Nitish's party JDU was very poor
 2009 main 20 seat jeetne vaali jediu maatr 2 seat hi jeet saki
 The situation can be gauged from the fact that party president Sharad Yadav also lost the election from Madhepura seat
 iske baad se hi raajnneetik virdohi nitish kumaar par nishaanaa saadh rahe the
 Senior Bihar BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi even claimed that he has about 50 JDU mlas in contact
 vah bijepi main shaamil ho sakate hai
 On the other hand, LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan, who recently joined the NDA, warned his supporters at a press conference on Saturday after his party's spectacular performance that the government in Bihar could fall anytime
 oktober tak chunaav ho sakate hai
 Therefore NDA workers should be prepared for the assembly elections
 raajnneetik virodhiyon ne nitish kumaar ke istife ko siyaasi dhong qaraar diya he
 He has questioned that Nitish has done this to gain sympathy after the crushing defeat

 phir hamaare sahare bihar ke mukhyamantri bane
 Today when Narendra Modi's popularity has increased in Bihar, he is seen moving his land
 khud piem banane kaa sapana paalane lage the ab jamini hakeekat kaa pataa chalaa to istipha dekar pind chhudaa liya
 Taking a dig at Nitish Kumar's resignation, BJP leader Giriraj Singh tweeted

 JDU has 116 mlas in the current assembly
 haalanki takneekee rup se agar dekhen to party ke paas keval 112 vidhayak hi hai
 The JDU had 117 mlas after separating from the BJP
 tab se lekar nitish kumaar ne 5 vidhayakon ko party se nikaal diya he
 Thus JDU now has only 112 mlas
 aisa lagata he ki dilli main aam aadmi party kii aitihaasik jeet kaa dar ab rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ko bhi sataane laga he
 The RSS has instructed the BJP not to take the Aam Aadmi Party lightly
 sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne bijepi se kaha he ki wo vidhansabha chunaavon ke nateezon se zyada khush na hon
 He will have to take the Aam Aadmi Party seriously or else the results of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections may not be as per the mind

 Every person who earns a tax plan has to pay tax
 so shuru main hi 80si ke niyam ke hisaab se nivesh karnaa shuru kar den
 Instead of looking at your financial advisor at the last moment, start the process early and make a complete plan for the amount invested to reduce the tax burden
 pipief jaise jariyon, jinamein nivesh par byaaj miltaa he, ko jitna jaldi ho, shuru kar den
 When it is an equity-related product like ELSS or a tax-saving joint fund, starting it early in the year means accumulating more units through SIP
 sahi beemaa chunebima (jivan, swasthya aadi) ko nivesh ke taur par na samajhen, balki use kisi anjaane khatre se bachaav ke saadhan ke rup main len
 Get out of the common belief that taking insurance only helps in saving tax
 beemaa ko jivan ke khatre se suraksha ke taur par len
 If you have taken an insurance plan, then see if the amount of insurance is sufficient to protect your family according to the current standard of living
 agar aisa nahin he to ek or beemaa yojana le len
 If you are only dependent on the health insurance scheme provided by the office, then you need to understand the full specifics and utility of that policy
 yah sunishchit karen ki aap par nirbhar parijanon ko is swasthya beemaa yojana kaa laabh mil rahaa he yaa nahin
 If not, get a new health plan
 ise jald le len kyonki in yojanaon main maujuuda yaa kuch khaas bimariyon ke liye pratiksha kii avadhi hoti he

 If she does not have an alliance with the SP, she can go to her lowest level
 hoga seat kaa vivadgathabandhan main agar areldi bhi aati he to congress kii siten kam ho sakati hai
 The SP has made it clear that they will keep 300 seats with them
 gathbandhan ke liye baaki siten chhod sakate hai
 It is obvious that if this grand alliance is replaced by the alliance, then the Congress will have to satisfy around 70 seats
 haalanki congress is gathbandhan ko sanjivani kii tarah le rahi he taaki vah ek santoshjanak sthiti main aa sake or haar kii tohamat se batch sake
 The SP is afraid of polarization; the SP is seeking to field with the SP coalition in UP because the area of the state seems to be divided into two sections after the Muzaffarnagar riots in August 2013

 The High Court has taken a tough stance on the pathology labs and diagnostic centers illegally opened in Delhi
 dillihoicourtne dilli sarkaar ke swasthya sachiv ko nirdesh jari karke kaha he ki wo dilli main gaiyrkanoonee rup se chal rahe in pathology labon or diagnostic centaron ke khilaaf uchit karrwai karen
 Also, in the order, it has been asked to go from place to place to check under which law these pathology labs are being run and whether they are following the terms and conditions which are required to run the center
 
 saath hi jab tak act main badlaav nahin ho jaataa he tab tak inpar sakhti se nazar rakhi jaae
 On the next hearing, the court has sought a status report from the Delhi government on how many places they have taken action against such pathology
 dilli hycourt ne ye aadesh ek janhit yachika par sunwaayee karte hue diya gaya he jisamen kaha gaya he ki rajdhani main avaidh rup se pathology lab or diagnostic centre kukuramute kii tarah khule hue he
 Not only this, there are untrained lab technicians working in them, nor are these technicians register
 yachikakarta kaa daawa he ki in aprashikshit lab technitian ko sample ko surakshit rakhane samet unke test karne kaa koi anubhav nahin he
 They do not have any degree courses
 jo vahaan pahunchane vaale marijon ke liye jaanaleva sabit ho saktaa he
 This illegal pathology lab is a big threat to the common people
 yachika main is tarah kii lab par niyantran ke liye dilli sarkaar ko disha-nirdesh dene kii baat kahi gai he
 In the petition filed by Bijoun Kumar Mishra, the court has been requested that these pathology labs need to be closed immediately
 yachikakarta ne kaha he ki dilli sarkaar pathology lab kholane ke liye banaai gai policy par dobaaraa vichaar karen, jisase yah sunishchit ho sake ki aprashikshit technitian lab ko nahin chalaayenge
 On November 30, the court will hear the case again
 netaaon kii jubaan kab or kahaan phisal jaae iskaa anumaan laga paanaa mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 Senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader Murali Manohar Joshi has also become a part of this league
 bijepi netaa murali manohar joshi ne pakistani aatanki hafiz said ko 'shri hafiz said' kah daalaa
 This is not the first time an Indian politician has been so respected by a terrorist
 isse pehle congresmahasachiv digvijay singh ne most wanted aatankwaadi haafiz said ko 'haafiz said sahab' kahkar sambodhit kiya tha
 Interestingly, there are many other leaders and ministers in the Congress government and party who have used respectful addresses for the leaders of terror
 aatankwaad ko lekar bharat-pakistan ke rishton par sansad main bolte hue grih mantri susheel kumaar scindia ne bhi haafiz said ke liye sammanjanak sambodhan kaa istemaal kiya tha or hafiz said ko 'shri hafiz said' kaha tha
 After the Kargil War in 1999, when the Group of Ministers (GOM), formed under the chairmanship of the then Deputy PM Lal Krishna Advani in 2001, reviewed, there was a lack of coordination between the three armies
 agar teenon senaaon ke bich thik se talmail hota to nuksaan ko kaaphi kam kiya ja saktaa tha
 At that time, it was suggested to create the post of Chief of Defense (CDS), which has been announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the occasion of Independence Day on 15 August today after nearly 20 years
 haalanki tab vaajapeyi sarkaar main mantriyon ke samooh kii sifarish par sena ke teenon angon ke bich sahmati na ban paane ke kaaran ise thande baste main daal diya gaya tha
 However, later taking out the middle route, the post of Chiefs of Staff Committee (cosc) was created for proper coordination between the three armies
 haalanki iske chairman ke paas koi khaas shakti nahin hoti, bas vah teenon senaaon ke bich talmail karata he
 At present, Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa is the Chairman of the Chief of Staff Committee
 kuch samay baad chif of dephence kaa sthai pad banane kii phir maang uthi
 Manohar Parrikar had also claimed that he would become the Chief of Defense in the Army within two years while he was the Defense Minister
 ab jaakar swatantraaa diwas par piem modi ne iskaa elaan kiya he
 With its formation, the three armies will be able to work in coordination during the war
 single point se aadesh jari hone se senaaon kii maarak kshamta or prabhavi hogi
 Because then there will be no confusion of any kind between the three parts of the army
 jaisaa ki pakistan or china se hue yudhon ke dauraan teenon senaaon main samanvay kii chook saamne aa chuki thi
 The Air Force then opposed the CDS system, with the recommendations of the GOM headed by Lal Krishna Advani accepted by the then Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), yet it was put on hold
 darasal army or navy ke afasaron ne is pad kaa tab saport kiya tha, magar airforce ne virodh kiya tha
 At the same time, the will to create this post from political level also was not shown
 admill arun prakaash or purv ormi chif general bikram singh ne sena ke teenon angon main sudhaar or integration ke liye is pad CDS kii jarurat bataai thi
 However, former Air Force Chief Air Chief Marshal S
 Krishnaswamy, opposing the post of Chief of Defense, termed it unnecessary
 kai deshon ke paas CDS sistarmerica, china, united kingdom, japan sahit duniya ke kai deshon ke paas chif of dephence jaisi vyavastha he
 These are positions in the armies of Noto countries
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki vistrut bhoomi, lambii simaaon, tatarekhaon or rashtriya suraksha kii chunautiyon ko simit sansadhano se nipatane ke liye bharat ke paas ekikrut raksha pranali ke liye chif of dephence pad kii bahut jarurat thi
 The Chief of Staff Committee currently in force consists of the Chief of the Army, Navy and Air Force
 sabase varisht sadsy ko iskaa chairman niyukt kiya jaataa he
 This ceremonial post is given to the senior-most member till retirement on rotation basis
 dhanoa 31 may se sioessi ke chairman bane hai
 The Chairman of the Chief of Staff Committee has the responsibility of ensuring coordination between the three armies
 desh ke saamne maujuud bahari suraksha chunautiyon se nipatane ke liye saamaanya ranneeti taiyaar karne kaa daayitv bhi sioessi kaa hi hota he
 Bharatiya Janata Party President Nitin Gadkari met Congress President Sonia Gandhi at his residence on Monday

 Union Communications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who came on the agenda organized in New Delhi, said that the monopoly of any one company will not be allowed in telecom
 He said that the government will revive BSNL and MTNL
 No single company will be allowed to rule unanimously

 ham to sarkari companiyon beasenel or emtnael ko bhi rivive karne main lage hai
 In the backward frontier areas of the country, the telecom service has developed on the trust of these companies and will be further
 acchhee baat yah he ki in companiyon ke 92 hajaar logon nevyares ke liye applikia he
 'what is the issue that many private companies have been alleging that a telecom company Jio is benefiting from the government's policies
 jeeyo se mil rahi tagdi pratispardhaa se baaki nijee companiyon kii haalat bahut kharaab he
 Apart from this, adjusted telecom revenue (AGR) charged by the government has led many telecom companies to the brink of ruin
 haal main supreme court dwaara agiaar dene ke aadesh se unki qamar hi tut gai he
 This gives the telecom companies about 1
 30 lakh karod rupee kaa agiaar sarkaar ko dena hoga
 Airtel will have to pay Rs 43,000 crore under this and Vodafone Idea Rs 40,000 crore
 vodaphone idia ko duusari timahi main bhartiya corporate itihaas kaa sabase zyada 50,921 karod rupee kaa bada ghaataa hua he
 Similarly, Airtel has also incurred a huge loss of Rs 23,045 crore
 signal main ho rahaa sudharsignal ke sawaal par ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki ab signal main sudhaar ho rahaa he
 But the lack of the tower makes it a bit difficult

 We opened 37 crore accounts of the poor who were outside the banking system
 8 lakh karod rupee diarect benifit transfar kiye gaye
 He said that the digital economy is moving ahead in India, Facebook is the highest in the world, whatsapp is in India
 lekin aatankiyon or bhrasht logon kii koi niztaa nahin hoti
 Governments take data about them only when needed
 yah kanoonee tareeke se hota he
 He said, 'data in India comes in billions, we want India to be the center of data processing
 ham bharat ko duniya kii top data iconomi bananaa chaahate hai

 In this regard, PM Modi has given clear indications in talks with neighboring countries many times whether the issue is economic or environment related, we have to keep our words firmly
 varisht patrkaar shashi shekhar ke mutabik, vikasshil deshon kii ore se majboot sandesh jayega
 Traveling to Brazil is also important because the economic world is not limited only to import and export, but it is also related to environment and other issues
 ' brazil main shikhar sammelan se alag hatakar bricks ke anya chaaron saathi sadsy deshon ke shasnadhyakshon ke saath piem modi kii alag-alag baatcheet bhi hogi
 But the most important of these will be Modi's talks with Chinese President Xi Chin Fing

 This will provide employment to the youth, and things will also get cheaper
 piem modi is babat pehle bhi kai baar china kii yatra kar jayja le chuke hai
 - China's obstinate attitude on stapled visas is also expected to gain importance in this conversation
 -jaahir he ki donon deshon ke shasnadhyaksh aamane-saamne honge to seemaa vivaad or ghuspaith ke maamle jarur uthenge haalanki pakistan se ulat china ke saath ye santosh kii baat he ki donon deshon ke bich baatcheet or sena ke saajha abhyaas bhi chalate hai

 team india ke khilaadiyon ke liye test series main vaapasi ke liye melbern test aakhri mauka he, or yah baat team india ke captain mahendra singh dhoni ke dhurandhar bakhubi jaanate honge, lekin series main 0-2 se pichhadane ke baad team india ke liye melbern main vaapasi kaa rasta itnaa aasaan bhi nahin hoga
 At least, according to the data, this is a very difficult challenge
 melbern cricket maidan main team india or australia ke bich ab tak kul 11 test match khele gaye hai, jinamein se aath test australia ne jite hai, jabaki bharat yahaan sirf do test jeetne main kaamyaab rahaa he
 There has been a Test match draw between the two teams
 itnaa hi nahin, bharat is maidan par beete 33-34 saalon main koi test match nahin jeet sakaa he, or is dauraan bhartiya cricket team ne yahaan paanch test match khele or paanchon main use haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 India last defeated Australia by 59 runs in the year 1980-81 thanks to Kapil Dev's superb bowling, and before that in 1977-78 Sunil Gavaskar's century and Bhagwat Chandrasekhar's superb bowling made the team the first in this field
 Won
 lekin beete kai saalon main melbern main team india kaa pradarshan bahut acha nahin rahaa he
 Given the current level of the team, Team India is not expected to win in Melbourne, but according to Australian veteran cricketer Ricky Ponting, the Indian team can expect a win here
 unhone kaha, team india is series main jo test match jeet sakati he, vah melbern test hi he, kyonki yahaan kii dhimi or sapaat wicket par team india behatar pradarshan kar sakati he
 The Melbourne pitch is expected to help the spinners, but the important question is whether the players of Team India will be able to take advantage of this wicket
 
 
 ? kya middle order ballebaaz mushkil palon main wicket par tikne kaa saahas dikhaa paaenge
 
 
 The Will Team India win the flag of victory in Melbourne? 
 
 ? in sab sawaalon kaa jawaab haa main paane ke liye team ke khilaadiyon ko karishmai pradarshan karnaa hoga, or uske bina itihaas badalane kii ummid nahin kii ja sakati
