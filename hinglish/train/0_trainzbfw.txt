 After which he was formally welcomed by Sirisena
 input-ians December 16 is set to be answered from September 10
 haal ke vakt kaa sabase bada faisla mangalvaar ko aane vaala he
 a decision that the entire nation is eyeing
 bahut mumkin he ki ye faisla aaj ke hindustan ke liye ek nazeer sabit ho
 The fast track court is going to give its verdict in the Delhi gang rape case on Tuesday
 par ye faisla aae usase pehle khud gangrape kii shikaar wo ladki kuch kahana chaahati he
 That too from the court
 yor honor main bhi kuch kahana chaahati hum
 i am the most important witness in this case
 jinke mukademe kaa faisla aap kar rahe hai
 If they are murderers, i am dumb
 agar wo jaalim hai ko main majaloom hum
 If they are stones, then i am the heart that has been crushed
 yor honor, aakhir ye kaise ho saktaa he ki mujhe insaaf dene ke aapke iraade main meri gavaahi shaamil nahin hai
 Your Honor i am in the pan of the scales on which you weigh oppression with justice
 lekin yor honor meri baat sirf or sirf isliye nahin suni ja rahi he, kyonki main khud apane liye bhi raakh main tabdeel ho chuki hum
 Let your Honor your law do not obey the statement of a dead or not
 kam se kam main aapse baat to kar sakati hum naa
 Your Honor was with me on the night of December 16, the people who had killed Lavas
 unamem se ek ne to khudakushi kar lee
 He did not even wait for your decision
 apana faisla khud kar liya, apni sajaa khud tay kar lee
 Your honor is the one who showed the most ruthlessness with me
 aapkaa kanoon or hamaara samaaj use baccha samajhataa he
 But who is responsible for the bestiality inside the child? Both you and this society become silent about this
 yor honor, agar aapako mujhe, meri maut, mere saath hui darindagi ko, hakeekat main insaaf dena he, to ek aisi duniya banane ke liye samaaj ko, kanoon ko, kanoon kii hifaazat karne waalon ko majaboor kar dijie ki meri jaisi ladakiyon ko
 Let my sisters, my mothers, think they are safe
 jab kisi kii ankhon main vaasana utre to usase pehle uskaa dil anjaam ke khauf se kaanp uthe
 If you did not do this then leave someone as a child
 kisi ko faansee de dena yaa umr kaid dena, isse kuch nahin hoga
 Nothing will happen, sir
 or mujhe ye maaloom he ki is hakeekat ko mujhase zyada acchhee tarah aap jaanate hai
 Your honor you are going to tell the decision, so i want you to hear the story of the doom that was broken that night once again
 meraa dost us raat mere saath tha
 The biggest witness of that torture
 main to rahi nahin, to meraa vahi dost aapako us raat kii kahani sunayega
 Please listen to your honor
 adaalat se jo kahana tha wo to kah diya usne
 Now she wants to tell the story of that night outside the court with her friend
 wo chaahati he ki qayaamat kii us raat jo kuch us par beeti wo ek baar phir adaalat sune
 So that it is easy to decide
 ravivaar kaa din tha
 i was returning to see the evening show film 'life of Pi' at Saket Mall with my friend
 hamen saket se palam mode tak janaa tha
 But no autowala was ready to run
 badi mushkil se bina meter ke ek autowala chalane ko raji hua
 From there we reached Munirka Bus Stand in Auto
 ham donon bas stop par khadey bas kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 But no bus arrived for a long time
 phir isi bich bas stop par safed rang kii ek chartd bas aakar rukii
 Only one boy in that bus gave us a voice
 hamaare poochne par usne bataalia ki bas palam gaanv kii taraf hi ja rahi he
 So we both boarded the bus
 jab ham bas main chadhe to andar sawari kii seat par teen log baith the
 We later came to know that those three are not the passengers of the same bus
 bas main chadhate hi maine unase do baar tikat ke liye kaha
 He then took twenty rupees from us
 bas chalane ke kuch hi der baad achaanak sawari ke taur par baithe teenon ladakon ne hamaari taraf dekhakar hamen ulataa-sidhaa bolnaa shuru kar diya
 Then when they started being very abusive, i got angry and i beat them up
 unhone jhagada jaanboojh kar mujhe uksaane ke liye hi kiya tha
 Because as soon as the fight broke out, two more people who were already in the bus suddenly came forward and attacked me with an iron rod
 rod sir par laga tha isliye main behosh hone laga
 After this i just saw that he was pulling my friend towards the back seat of the bus
 is dauraan main or meri dost donon madad ke liye lagaataar chilla rahe the
 But no help came
 yahaan tak ki meri dost mujhe bachaane ke liye khud bich main aa gai
 He confronted them
 yahaan tak ki usne apane mobile se 100 number par police ko kol bhi karne kii koshish kii
 But the miscreants snatched the mobile from him
 ham ab puri tarah funs chuke the
 Those people had also switched off the bus lights
 is bich meri dost ne jitani baar khud ko bachaane kii koshish kii, utani hi baar badmaashon ne us par hamalaa kiya
 He was badly beaten up
 par is dauraan puure raste main ek baar bhi koi madadgaar najar nahin aayaa
 After two hours, when the miscreants' lust was over, they probably felt for the first time that my friend was dead, i was listening
 wo aapas main baaten kar rahe the ki lagata he ladki mar gai
 So kill me as well
 iske baad mere upar achaanak phir se rod se hamalaa shuru ho gaya
 My friend was now completely unconscious and bled
 or main bhi dam saadhe chupchaap bas kii farsh leta tha
 So that they do not feel that there is still life in me
 iske baad un logon ne meraa or meri dost kaa purse, bag, mobile sab kuch le liya
 Then finally he took off all the clothes of both of us
 iske baad raat kareeb gyaarah baje mahipalpur fliover ke najadik chalati bas se unhone ham donon ko neeche phenk diya
 He wanted to crush us with the same bus by throwing down
 par main kisi tarah apni dost ko khinchate hue chalati bas ke pahie se dur le gaya
 After this, he ran into the bus and got lost in Andher
 ab ham donon puri tarah lahuluhaan sadak kinare pade the
 The blood was still flowing
 jism par ek bhi kapadaa nahin tha, thad bhi bahut thi
 Somehow i was courageously raising my hand and begging people for help that someone should bring both of us to the hospital
 koi hamen kapade de de
 But no one helped us
 is dauraan vahaan se bahut se autowale, kaarwale gujarey, kaiyon ne speed bhi kam karke hamaari taraf dekha, par rukaa koi nahin
 The martyrs were not helping us so as not to get caught in the case of police case or testimony
 baad main kai paidal guzarane waalon ne bhi hamaari haalat dekhi
 He also came to us, stood up, but only like a spectacle
 bina kisi madad ke kareeb 20-25 minute tak ham donon isi tarah bas pade rahe
 Time was passing, blood was flowing unaccounted for
 meri dost puri tarah se behosh thi
 But i still had no idea how and what he got wounds? We were lying on the roadside for quite some time
 phir kahin jaakar ek shaks ne hamen dekha or usee ne police ko phone kiya
 After a while, i saw that three PCR vans had reached us at the same time: but instead of helping us, they were first deciding among themselves which police station would be our case? i was still constantly screaming, screaming
 gidgidaa rahaa tha ki hamen kapade de do, ambulance bula do, aspataal pahunchaa do
 But for half an hour in the circle of the police station, he drove to this place
 aadhe ghante baad kahin jaakar wo log ek chadar laae jisase maine apni dost ko dhakaa
 His condition was getting worse, then i somehow picked him up and lied on the seat of the PCR van and sat on his own
 vahaan najadik hi ek aspataal bhi tha
 i also told the policeman that my friend's condition is deteriorating, take you here
 par police vaale hamen vahaan se bahut dur safadarajang aspataal le gaye
 a lot of our time wasted in getting there
 aspataal pahunchane ke baad bhi hamaari kisi ne madad nahin kii
 For a long time i kept asking people for a certain cloth
 par kisi ne kapadaa tak nahin diya
 i said it is cold, if not the blanket, give the curtain on the door and window
 safaiwale tak se madad maangi
 But no one helped
 phir kisi tarah maine ek aadmi se uskaa mobile maanga or apane ghar phone kiya
 i told the family that our accident is over
 asal main mujhe samaj main hi nahin aa rahaa tha ki main unase kya boluun? dost ke saath film dekhakar lautne kii baat bataa nahin saktaa tha
 After arriving at the hospital, for the first time i came to know what has happened to my friend
 jaanwaron se bhi badtar suluk kiya tha unhone uske saath
 She was not even able to speak
 tab maine usase likhakar poocha ki use kya ho rahaa he? usne jawaab diya ki use ilaaj ke kharche kaa tension he
 It will cost a lot of money
 haa, usne ye bhi likhaa tha ki un badmaashon ko faansee nahin balki jinda jalaakar maaraa jaae
 i constantly met my friend in Safdarjung
 use ye bhi bataaya ki kaise puraa desh uske liye lard rahaa he
 She also used to ask me about those criminals, what happened to them? i told him all were caught
 haa, use ilaaj ke kharch kii badi chintaa thi
 Always kept asking how much would it cost? i used to tell him not to worry about expenses
 bas tum thik ho jaao
 Although my hands and feet were injured
 pair kii haddi tuuti hui thi
 But from that night of December 16, the police kept me in the police station for the next three-four days
 sach bataaun to jis din esadm meri dost kaa bayaan le rahi thim us roj mujhe pehali baar meri dost par hue julm kaa puraa sach pataa chalaa
 Even animals cannot do so much cruelty
 wo bhi shikaar ko galaa dabaakar maar daalata he
 But i can't even say what happened here

 The Central Information Commission has given an important verdict on the RTI filed by RTI activist Neeraj Sharma, who lives in Delhi, to the Ministry of Commerce
 artiai kaaryakarta niraj sharma ne july 2017 main commers ministry main artiai ke jariye yah poocha tha ki centre sarkaar ne mek in india event par kitna kharch kiya he
 It also sought an answer as to how many mous ie Memorandum of Understanding were signed through this event and how much money was invested in India

 Despite the filing of the first appeal after the Ministry's reply, when the RTI activist did not get enough answers, he challenged the petition before the CIC
 july 2017 main daakhil is artiai activist kii yachika par sunwaayee karte hue 16 may 2019 ko siaisi ne vaanijya mantralay ke kendriya soochna adhikari ko nirdesh jari kiya ki vah agle 15 dinon ke bheetar yachikakarta ko uske dwaara puche gaye sawaalon ke jawaab muhaiyaa karaae

 punjab ke sarkari skulon main mahila teachers ke liye dress code ke vivaadit aadesh ko lekar ek maheenaa pehle kaaphi aalochana hui thi
 The education department of the state government had to withdraw the dress code notification
 yaheen nahin notification jari karne vaale do afasaron ko nilambit bhi kar diya gaya tha
 The dispute was not yet put to an end that there is a lot of resentment among women teachers for the new format of Annual Confidential Report (ACR) about the teachers' performance
 is formet main kisi teacher kii parformens kaa akalan karne ke liye uske 'pahanaave' par bhi gaur kiya jayega
 On learning about the matter, Punjab Education Minister Aruna Chaudhary has ordered to remove the dress column from the format
 2016-17 kii ACR main 'pahanava' naam se nayaa kollam joda gaya he
 Under this, numbers will be given to the teachers who wear 'properly attired' in the school
 iske tahat nodel officer yaa principal se poocha jayega ki sambandhit varsh ke dauraan teacher kis tarah ke kapade pahanakar skool ain
 In the ACR report, two columns have been made regarding the clothes of the teachers
 ek kollam main likhaa he- 'thik' or duusare kollam main likhaa he 'bhadakaau'
 However, it has not been clarified which type of clothing would be considered 'inflammatory' or 'offensive'
 kya salwar suut yaa sari ko 'thik' or genes-top yaa anya western kapadon ko 'bhadakaau' mana jayega?bataaya ja rahaa he ki teacher ke parformens ko aankane ke vakt kul 5 numberon main se 0
 The number 5 will be clothing
 iske alaava or kai pahaluon par bhi teacher ke parformens kaa akalan hoga jaise ki skool kaa board parikshaon main kaisaa parinaam aayaa
 In the ACR, it is clearly written that teachers' clothes should also be made the basis while assessing the performance and more marks should be given on arrival
 shiksha vibhaag ne teachers or anya non teaching staff kii ACR report taiyaar karwaanaa shuru kar diya he
 By 31 August, these reports will have to be prepared and submitted to the Education Department by the Nodal Officer of the districts
 pahanaave ke alaava jin muddon par teachers ke parformens kaa akalan hoga ve hai-1
 What percentage of the teacher's class result was
 2
 What percentage of students passed in the subject that the school teacher teaches
 3
 Whether the teacher used the blackboard to teach the students or not
 4
 Did the teacher sit in the chair while teaching the children or walk around the class and keep an eye on the students and teach them
 5
 Did the teacher use the modern techniques that were given to the teachers during training by the Education Department
 6
 How did the teacher treat the other teachers and principal of the school
 teacher ke parformens ko lekar ye sab baaten to vaazib hai lekin pahanaave ke kollam ko lekar teachers main sabase zyada naaraazgi he
 Teachers in government schools, on condition of anonymity, said that even though the Punjab Education Department has withdrawn the decision of the dress court imposed on them, the dress code is now being imposed indirectly through the format
 inkaa kahana he ki parformens main kapadon ko lekar liye ja rahe feedback ke bare main jab pataa laga to jhatka laga
 After all, how can the government tell a woman teacher what kind of clothes she came to school? These teachers say that their performance should be judged on their results and knowledge of the subject and not on their clothes
 pahanaave se jude formet par aam aadmi party se vidhayak baljinder cor or roopinder rubi ne ninda kii he
 Among the Akali Dal leaders, former Education Minister Daljit Singh Cheema and Parminder Singh Dhindsa have also targeted the Congress government
 maamle ke tool pakadaney par punjab kii shiksha mantri aruna choudhary ne purvavartuakali-bijepi sarkaar parapalla jhaadne kii koshish kii
 Aruna Chaudhary said that the performance ATR forms sent are old forms of 2012 and these forms were prepared during the Akali Dal government
 aruna choudhary ke mutabik unki sarkaar kii bilkul bhi manshaa nahin hai ki teachers ko bataaya jaae ki unhen kis tarah ke kapade pahanane chahie
 Aruna Chaudhary said that the performance of the teachers will be assessed on the basis of their merit
 aruna choudhary ne bataaya ki jaise hi unhen jaankaree mili unhone in puraane formon se pahanaave kaa kollam hataane ke aadesh die hai
 Let me tell you that when the notification of the implementation of the dress code was issued, then there was an attempt from the Congress government to dismiss it as a notification of the akali-bjp government
 dress code lagu karne ke notification ko pichhali akali-bijepi sarkaar ke vakt kaa notification qaraar diya tha
 This time also, the education minister of Punjab is describing this ATR performance form as the old form of 2012
 lekin sawaal ye he ki puraane form ko bhejne se pehle unki thik se jaanch kyon nahin kii gai? ye kyon nahin gaur kiya gaya ki inhen bhejne se teachers kii naaraazgi ke chalate phir bavaal ho saktaa he

 Maha Shivratri 2019: The festival of Maha Shivaratri will be celebrated on 4 March 2019
 mana jaataa he ki sristi ke prarambh main isi din madhyaraatri ko bhagwaan shankar kaa brahma se rudra ke rup main avataran hua tha
 It is said that if worship of Bhole Baba is done on any day in Mahashivratri, Bhole Tripurari will open his heart and fulfill the wishes of his devotees
 mahashivaratri bhagwaan shiv ke pujan kaa sabase bada parv he
 Maha Shivaratri festival is celebrated on Phalgun Krishna Chaturdashi
 tyohaar se pehle hi taiyaariyaan kar lenaa behatar hota he
 Prepare before Mahashivratri in this way - take light white or light pink clothes after bathing
 - bhagwaan suryanarayan ko tambe ke lote se jal den or vahiin par khadey hokar 3 pradakshina karen
 - Now start cleaning in the temple of your house and if possible, install the temple of your house in the northeast corner in the northeast corner
 - mandir ke sabhi saamaan ko vyavasthit tareeke se rakhen
 - Clean the diya, plate, bell, conch etc
 used in the temple beforehand
 - mahashivaratri kii puja main prayog hone vaali samast samagriyon ko pehle se hi juta kar rakhen
 - One day before Mahashivaratri, by preparing in this way, you will not have any kind of disturbance in the next day's puja and mind will remain in the work of worship
 bhagwaan shiv ko arpit kii jane vaali saamagree-mahashivaratri se ek din pehle aap bhagwaan shiv ko arpan karne kii samast samagriyon ko khariden
 Such as roli, moli, whole rice, incense lamp, mishri, kamalgatta, whole turmeric, five types of fruits, white sweetmeat, white sandalwood, nagkasar, saffron, mishri, belpatra, ak dhatura, hemp, red and yellow rose flowers, aka Flowers, colorful Abir Gulal, rose and sandalwood perfume
 in sari samagriyon ko ek din pehle hi kharid kar apane puja ke sthaan par rakhen
 If there is suffering of Navagrahas in the magazine, then offer the following type of Abir to Lord Bholenath
 - surya, mangal kii pidaa ke liye laal rang kaa abir
 - Abir of pink or white color for torment of Moon and Venus
 - brihaspati ke liye naarangi or budh ke liye hare rang kaa abir
 - For the peace of Shani Rahu Ketu, buy sky or blue colored Abir to offer to Lord Shiva in advance
 mahashivaratri par pehle hi karen bhojan prasad kii vyavastha-- bhagwaan shankar par chadhaaya gaya prasad khaanaa nishiddh he
 It is believed that he who eats this prasad suffers from the miseries of hell
 is ksht ke nivaaran ke liye shiv kii murti ke paas shaaligram kii murti yaa bhagwaan vishnu kii pratimaa kaa rahanaa anivaary he
 If there is a Shaligram near the idol of Shiva, there is no fault of eating the Prasad
 - vrath ke vyanjanon main saamaanya namak ke sthaan par sendha namak kaa prayog karen
 Use only black pepper instead of red pepper
 - aap singhaade yaa kuttu ke aate ke pakora bana sakate hai
 Use of sago will also be good, because it contains carbohydrate and it also contains some amount of calcium and vitamin-c
 bhagwaan bholenath ko kaise karen prasann-- bhagwaan bholenath ko prasann karne ke liye mahashivaratri ke din subah ke samay jaldi uthen or snaan karen
 - Take a silver or steel lotus, mix raw milk and sugar in water and offer it with your right hand while chanting the Namah Shivaya mantra on Lord Shiva lingam
 vahiin par ek asana par baithkar shivashtak kaa 3 baar paath karen
 - Say your heart's desire to Lord Bholenath
 ghar waapas aate samay raste main jo jaruratmand log mili unhen kuch fal, vastra aadi kaa daan karen
 - During the evening, offer a pure Rudraksha garland to Lord Shiva with white yellow flowers
 aisa karne se aapke swasthya main vruddhi hogi
 HCL Chairman Shiv Nadar has given a big statement about the challenges present in the country
 unhone mangalvaar ko kaha ki maujuuda samay main desh tamaam tarah kii chunautiyon se guzar rahaa he lekin in tamaam samasyaon kaa sarkaar akele hi samaadhaan nahin kar sakati
 Shiv Nadar said this at a program organized on the occasion of the foundation day of the National self-service Association
 unhone kaha ki nijee kshetron, nagarikon or enjio ko bhi desh ke saamne khadi chunautiyon se nipatane main yogadan dena hoga
 In the field of primary education, he talked about his initiative called 'shiksha', how the institution is engaged in bringing revolutionary changes in silence in basic education of many states of the country
 unhone kaha ki aaj hamaare saamne nai chunautiyaan hai
 For the last several decades, we struggled with polio, small pox, hunger, illiteracy, basic health facilities, etc
 in samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye sabhi hitdharakon ko prayaas karnaa hoga, isamen nijee kshetra or nagarikon kii samaan sahabhaagita jaruri he
 He said, "I am honored to be invited to the program
 reshimbagh kaa maidan aaj sangh kaaryakataaron ke urja or utsaah se jeevant ho uthaa he
 It is worth mentioning that in the same program Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat said that 'mob lynching' is a Western method and should not be used in the context of India to discredit the country
 bataa den kivijaydashmike maukey par yahaan ke reshmibagh maidan main ‘shastr puja' ke baad swayamsevakon ko sambodhit karte hue mohan bhagwat ne yah baat kahi
 He said that the term 'lynching' did not originate from Indian ethos, such a word should not be imposed on Indians
 is dauraan sangh pramukh ne kaha ki jammu kashmir ko vishesh darja dene vaale anuchhed 370 ke adhiktar praavdhaan hataane ke liye pradhanmantri modi or grih mantri shah kii saraahna kii jaani chahie
 It was a bold move
 unhone kaha ki beete kuch varshon main bharat kii soch kii disha main ek parivartan aayaa he, jise na chaahane vaale vyakti duniya main bhi he or bharat main bhi, or nihit swaarthon ke liye ye shaktiyaan bharat ko drudh or shakti sampann nahin hone dena chaahatin
 On the security of the country, the union chief said that fortunately, the state of security of our country, the preparedness of our army, the security policy of our governance and the state of efficiency in our international politics has been made in such a way that we are aware and Are confident
 unhone kaha ki hamaari sthal seemaa va jal simaaon par suraksha satarkta pehle se acchhee he
 Only the number of land border guards and outposts and the water border (islands with islands) monitoring will have to be increased
 desh ke andar bhi ugravadi hinsa main kami aayi he
 The number of militants surrendered has also increased
 bhagwat ne kaha ki samaaj ke vibhinn virgon ko aapas main sadbhaavna, samvaad tathaa sahyog badhaane ke prayaas main prayasarat hona chahie
 The harmony, harmony and co-operation of all sections of society and the expression of their opinions within the limits of the law constitution is an absolutely necessary thing in today's situation
 dashahara kaa parv sangh ke liye kaaphi myne rakhata he kyonki isi din 1925 main sanghathan kii sthapana hui thi

 Significantly, earlier Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat had asked the NRC in Assam in an effort to allay people's concerns about the exclusion of people that not a single Hindu would have to leave the country
 mana ja rahaa thakibhagwatne yah tippanee sangh or bhaajapa samet usase jude sanghathanon kii band daravaaje ke peeche hui samanvay baithak ke dauraan kii
 After the coordination meeting, a Sangh official said that Mohan Bhagwatji made it clear that not a single Hindu would have to leave the country
 unhone kaha tha ki duusare rashtron main pratadna or ksht sahane ke baad bharat aae hindu yaheen rahenge
 The much-awaited National Civil Register (NRC) in Assam has no names of more than 19 lakh applicants in the final list released on August 31

 The decision has been taken in a meeting held at the house of NCP chief Sharad Pawar

 Some people think that they just start the work and it reaches its own end
 maano koi jaadu ho
 Piyush Mishra says the same about himself, 'I touched the harmonium for the first time and it rang
 ' or tabase unka hormonium bajataa ja rahaa he
 Sometimes he rejects the world, sometimes he makes an aeroplane enter the tower of Des
 piyush mishra un logon kii jamaat main shaamil hai jo apane shabdon kii gaharaaiyon main khinchakar kisi ko dubo sakate hai
 And then the man who emerges emerges as someone else
 darasal piyush mishra 12 november ko 'sahitya aaj tak' ke manch par najar aaenge
 Literature is going on till 12 November in Delhi
 piyush mishra se unke bachapan se ab tak ke safar ko lekar phone par baatcheet hui
 Read below the excerpts of the conversation: - Question - When did your first encounter with literature? Piyush - i have been with literature since childhood
 bachapan se hi hindi sahitya padhane kaa bahut shauk tha
 Thanks to my father
 bachapan se nandan, paraag or aisi tamaam kitaaben padhata tha
 Like Chanda Mama
 inhen kitabon ne meraa sahitya se parichay karavaaya tha
 With these books, i joined literature
 phir na jane kab maine pehali poetry likh di
 At that time i was in eighth class
 wo aaj padhata hum to lagata he acchhee likhi thi
 Remember that Poetry? Yes, you have no doubt, i have seen taking a breath
 i have also seen hands and feet and body giving a lot of action
 ab bhale hi ye karte hue hont tumdard sehate hue sakht si lete hob he itnaa bhi kam kya tumhaare liekhub apni samaj main to ji lete ho
 i taught it to my colleagues
 mujhase wo umr main bade the
 He had his own understanding
 unhone kaha ki haa acha he acha he
 But in today's date, there is so much recognition for this poem, now i think it was written really well
 sawaal-jis tarah se litarechar evolve kar rahaa he, abhi aapako filmon main kitna sahitya miltaa he?piyush-kahin nahin chal rahaa he
 Nowhere is literature
 sawaal-filmon se sab gaayab ho chukaa he?piyush-bilkul sab gaayab he, pehle filmon main urdu shaayari zindaa thi
 These films were divided on better books
 re sahab ne kya kamaal filmein banaai thim
 The best scripts came through literature
 bandini vagairah ye sab thim
 This time it has completely disappeared
 aaj kal to sahitya se prerit koi cinema nahin ban rahaa he
 These biopics which are being made today, will be called films related to literature
 cinema apane aap main bahut bada sahitya he yaar
 Don't associate cinema with literature
 cinema main apane aap bahut bada sahitya he
 All of Raju Hirani's films are masterpieces
 vishaal bhai kii teen filmein maqbool, haidar or omkara main sahitya kii jhalak he
 There are no films inspired by Hindi literature
 lekin vahaan jo likhaa ja rahaa he wo apane aap main sahitya he
 This is cinema literature
 raju hiraani kii sari pikcharen lage raho munnabhai, munnabhai embibies or thri idiyats ye sabhi cinema kii masterpisej hai
 If these scripts are taught to the people, then how good will the world be
 ye apane aap main ek sahitya he
 Khosla's Ghosla is a literature in itself
 blike friday apane aap main ek khancha he
 Gangs of Wasseypur is a literature in itself
 to ye cinema kaa apana alag hi mazaa he
 Cinema should not be associated with story and atmosphere
 kyunki wo story cinema main tabdeel hote hote bahut saare paaydaan cross kar jaati he
 Talk about the third oath
 dedh panne kii story he maare gaye gulfaam
 How well she is transformed in the picture
 sawaal-aap hameshaa se likhte rahe hai
 But things have changed for you now
 is badlaav ke baad aapke padhane or likhane par kitna fark padhaa he?piyush-ab pehle ke mukaable bahut kam padhata hum
 Nowadays, education has reduced very much
 iskaa mujhe afsos he
 i write lekin jabase main santulit hua hum tabase meri har cheez main thodi si kami ai he
 i used to do a lot when i was absolutely crazy
 jabaki ye ulta hona chahie tha
 More things should be done when you are balanced
 lekin ham artists kaa ye durbhaagya he ki zindagi asantulit thi, jab zindagi sanbhale nahin sanbhal rahi thi, us vaqt maine bahut bahut likhaa, kya acting kari
 Did too much aaj kal thodaa kam hota he santulan kii vajah se
 Which i consider to be wrong
 aaj kal jo he matlab, likhane se, art se behatar chizein aa gayi hai
 Nowadays i will help some alcoholic
 agar koi alcoholic meri vajah se sudhar jaae to main use apane saare art se bada achievement maanata hum
 Nowadays the priority has changed
 sawaal-ek chiz jisane sahitya main sabase zyaada inspire kiya?piyush-aisa nahin ho saktaa
 i cannot be inspired by anything
 aisa nahin ho saktaa
 Rather i say that no one is inspired by basic people
 ye sab bakawaas baaten hai
 That i am inspired by it
 inspireshan aapke andar se aati he
 When you feel that you need to create, write and act, you cannot live without it or else your breath will suffocate
 tab aap apane aap ugal dete hai
 This inspiration, etc
 is all nonsense
 sab achche lage mujhe
 Everybody was good
 premchand se lekar tagore se lekar shakespeare se lekar sab jitne aapke modern shaayar hai
 Iqbal saheb inspired a lot
 sahir sahab bahut acha likhte the
 Majrooh sir inspired a lot
 lekin main ye nahin kah saktaa ki inase inspireshan lekar meri poetry bani
 i heard Bob Dillon when i had written a lot
 mujhe angreji gane samaj nahin aayaa karte the
 So i listened to him when i had already written a lot
 jab maine dekha usko to logon ne batalaaya ki tum to kaaphi inspired ho usase
 Meaning you get a lot of content
 lekin maine batalaaya ki isliye main dilan kaa naam letaa nahin hum
 i read it very late
 suna maine use
 It was a coincidence that two mindsets had merged
 ittefaq se main bhi usee tarj par gane laga tha or likhane laga tha
 One was that he used to write, i also used to write
 wo bhi compoz karte the, main bhi karata tha
 He used to sing, i used to sing too
 to shaayad ye bhi tha
 Perhaps it is found
 varanaa main kabhi kisi se nahin inspire hua

 He quit the Congress party four years ago and formed a separate party

 Please tell that Kiran Kumar Reddy left the Congress in February 2014 and formed 'jai Samayakya Andhra Party'
 ab ek baar phir se unhone congress kaa daaman tham liya he
 Before joining Congress, Reddy met Congress President Rahul Gandhi at his residence

 Whatever political identity has been given to me and my family because of the Congress
 'unhone kaha ki maujuuda haalat main rahul gandhi ke haath ko majboot karne kii jarurat he
 Until the Congress government is formed in Delhi, the people of Andhra Pradesh cannot get justice
 maujuuda centre kii modi sarkaar or rajya kii tidipi sarkaar buree tarah fail hui he
 Reddy said that the assurances given by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the Rajya Sabha for Andhra Pradesh should be fully implemented, otherwise people's faith will be lost from Parliament
 congress chhodane ke sawaal par reddy ne kaha ki is par main vistaar se baat kar chukaa hum

 Welcoming him in the Congress, Randeep Surjewala said that Reddy has served the Congress in the past and will continue to do so
 supreme court ne buudhvaar ko vyavastha di ki vidhayika kisi adaalat ke faisle ko ‘sidhe taur par radd’ nahin kar sakati

 The Supreme Court said, 'under many decisions of this court, it is a set rule that the legislature cannot directly cancel the decision of any court
 ’ court ne in kaarkaanon ke adhigrahan ke khilaaf daayar yachika ko sweekaar kar liya he
 The court said, "the decision of the Supreme Court is rejected and it is ordered that the cashew factories and land acquired by the state government under the amended law should be returned within eight weeks of the declaration of the verdict
" ’ullekhneey he ki court kaa yah faisla us yachika par aayaa he jisamen kerala kaashew factories (adhigrahan) kanoon, 1974 va sanshodhit kanoon ke kuch praavdhaanon kii sanvaidhanik vaidhata ko chunauti di gai thi
 These provisions gave the government the right to acquire private cashew firms
 sarkaar ne 1974 ke kanoon ke tahat 46 kaashew kaarkaanon kaa adhigrahan kiya or yah maamla 1990 ke dashak main supreme court main aayaa tha
 input language kuch bada hoga, kuch bada hoga
 Amid such speculation, Monday began

 Article 370 related to Kashmir is permanent or temporary? Know the opinion of constitutional experts, Naidu made it clear that while exercising his authority, he has decided that the letter which the Home Minister has written to him is also in this context, then the Home Minister will be heard first
 isamen puraa vipaksh lamaband ho gaya
 When Azad protested, Amit Shah took his name at least three times and said that listen to me, after that you can also keep your point and give whatever amendment you want, voting will also be done
 
 amit shah jab 370 khatm karne vaala sankalp padhane lage to vipaksh ko laga ki pehle vah jammu-kashmir rigerveshan sanshodhan pesh karenge par aisa nahin hua
 At this, Congress member Shailaja Kumari hinted to Azad to protest

 Sloganeering started

 Winner Kumarabhale Some families may have started Tinder (dating app) late, but not at all in my house
 mere chachere bhai-bahanon or vistaarit parivaar main ise andekha karnaa behad saamaanya he kyonki ham abhi bhi yah sikh hi rahe hai ki apane dalit maa-baap se prem-vivaah kii charchaa kaise karen
 In my closest world, Sari's troubles are still greater than any other for girls in love and relationships
 2013 main, ek chacheri bahan ko apane bhavi duulhe ke saath chal rahi baatcheet ke bich main sari pahanakar 'dikhaane' ko kaha gaya
 She went to her room staring
 cameraa band kiya or agle 30 minute tak oonchi aawaaj main grage anatomi dekhati rahi
 My sister's embarrassed parents and the boy's guardian spent 30 minutes sipping tea
 yaa, phir 2018 main ek duusari chacheri bahan kaa rishta lagbhag tay ho chukaa tha ki duulhe ke parivaar ne kaha, ''agali baar kripaya use sari pahanane ko kahen?'' ek hafte baad jab ve phir mili, to meri chacheri bahan ne khubasurat silk kii sari pahani or shaadi ke liye kaha, ''nahin, dhanyavad
 "such situations are somewhat strange
" in maamalon main ladakiyon ne manaa karne kii ek vicitra shakti dikhaai thi lekin ve aisi duniya main fansi hoti hai jisamen 'naa' kehane kii himmat nahin paidaa hoti
 This year, after standing firmly against love marriage for several decades, my mother called me alone during a family event and softly said, "we will also accept a Muslim or Christian boy
" '' yah vahi maa he jo meri shaadi tabhi karana chaahati thim jab main 18 saal kii thi (us hindu ladke se nahin jise main pyaar karti thi) or aaj vah is baat ko lekar chintit hai ki unki 31 vashiya beti shaayad kabhi shaadi hi nahin karnaa chaahegi
 For urban Dalit parents, this decade has been harsh and shocking
 pichley dashak main jab unhone shaharon kii ore rukh kiya to ve apane bacchon ko pehle skool or college main padhaanaa or phir naukariyon ke liye taiyaar karnaa chaahate the
 But when he now needed to treat adult children like a wise man who may have some dreams and who also fall in love, he was shocked
 na hi ham aage aane vaali sthitiyon se nipatane ko taiyaar the
 Interacting with Dalit parents who have grown up and grown up in the world of upper castes is challenging at various levels
 jab unhone hamen paala-posa to badi saavdhaanee se apane ateet kii parchaai se bachaakar rakhaa, unhone hamen is tarah taiyaar kiya ki hamen apane ateet ko bhuulakar or un chizon kaa kchabaav sanjone ko kaha jis par unka koi adhikaar nahin tha
 In a world where the stories of love and violence are dominated by the Savarnas, the desires of the Avarnas are erased even before they appear
 meri peedi ke dalit baligon kii apane mata-pita ke prati kadavaahat bhaawanaaon kii ek uljhan he, kyonki isamen krodh or sahanubhuti donon hi hai; hamen unase pehle dalit or phir mata-pita ke rup main saamana karnaa padataa he
 In 2009, i made a modest contribution to the 'pink Tights' campaign launched against the excesses of right-wing moral watchdogs
 usee saal baad main, mujhe yah jaanakar bahut sadma laga ki mere pita ne pramod mutalik or unke shriram sene ko 'bhartiya samskruti kii raksha ke liye' das hajaar rupye kaa chanda diya
 i was very angry and restless, so i sent another underwear and then gave up
 kuch samay pehle, ek ambedkarwaadi prakaashak ne mujhase poocha tha ki mere pita itane dakshinpanthi or dalit virdohi kyon the
 i laugh savarne kii duniya main ek dalit vyakti se vah or kya ummid karte hai?haalanki 2010 kaa dashak naitik paharuon or lav jihad or un donon ke khilaaf virodh pradarshnon kaa dashak tha or yahi dashak dhara 377 ko khatm karne jaise anya mahatvapurn kshanon kaa sakshi rahaa he, ham dhire-dhire hi sahi par is sachai ko sweekaar rahe hai ki dalit pariwaron, chaahe shahari ho yaa gaiyr-shahari sabaki sthiti ek jaisi he, ko vaise adhikaar nahin hai jaisaa real time news kaa hota he
 We are either far ahead and the news barely catches our pace or so far behind that it sometimes feels like we are still in the '90s
 ham vaastavik samay main jivan bitaate lagate nahin, jabaki hamaara vajood aaj maujuud he
 If someone is not living in real time, it is not easy to make a good impression in view of what is happening in this country today
 ek vicitra badlaav main, twitor ek adda ban gaya lagata he jahaan daliton kii yuva peedi real time kii bhaavana kaa anubhav karti he
 For many Dalit women, this is their first experience of being in such a real-time community
 akhil bhartiya dalit mahila manch kii mahasachiv or activist aashaa kovetal kaa kahana he ki do logon ke bich ke prem kii tulana main, saamudayik prem unke liye adhik moolyawaan he
 However, consultant Christina Dhanraj of alternative social media network Smashboard believes that the community does not always guarantee it
 ve kahati hai, ''pyaar kii kami hamaare utpeeda ke centre main he
 Dalit women, and especially those who are not traditionally beautiful or like Savarnas, have to struggle to find love
 matlab ki badale main kuch paane ke liye unhen baar-baar or alag-alag tareekon se bahut kuch dena hota he
 Despite this, you can be despised in the community and in relationships
 ''is dashak ne jo duusari cheez di he vah ek khaas tarah kaa nariwad he jo dalit mahilaon ko shaamil karne main khud ko asuvidhajanak paa rahaa he
 Essentially, it represents the failure of upper caste systems to understand the love, violence or even desires of people other than themselves
 ve teji se viksit hone vaale nae sanskarnon ko dekhte hue apane khud ke puraane sanskarnon ko sensor karne or khaarij karne kii shighrata main hai
 The story of the silent heroine Preity of the hit Telugu film Arjun Reddy in 2017 was something well-known, which i found difficult to deny
 'haa', 'nahin', 'mat karo' 'dfa ho jaao' kehane kii uski aakshamata ne mujhe pareshaan kar diya
 It brought back memories from 10 years ago when i saw a worse situation
 2007 main hinsak, apmanjanak arjuna reddy jaisaa pyaar hi tha jise main jaanati thi or adhik jaananaa chaahati thi
 Not because i saw an atmosphere of violence in the house, or not because i was exposed to a lot of Bollywood or Tollywood, but because it was happening all around me, with my friends or with my sisters
 kehane kii jarurat nahin ki main khud bhi aisi hi ladki bananaa chaahati thi
 These were mostly straight-haired upper caste girls, whose shameful behavior fascinated me and i tried unsuccessfully to imitate him
 ve bahut sundar thim lekin unke jivan main bhi koi utsaah nahin dikhataa tha
 Like us she was also upset
 haa, pareshaaniyaan alag-alag thim
 But the fact that they were equally popular among boys and girls and this led me to believe that love stories (no matter what kind) were made only for girls like them
 main khud ko is tarah se pyaar yaa chaahane ke laayak nahin paati thi kisi ke bheetar mere liye bhi koi junun, or kam aakraamakata paidaa kar sake
 Today, i acknowledge 'thank God'
 adhik mahatvapurn baat, nariwadi tab tak durust nahin he jab tak ham use ateet ke saath saamanjasy sthapit karne ke liye jagah nahin dete, jab hamane moorkhtapurna tareeke se us hinsa kaa bachaav kiya tha
 Had there been scope, the complex nature of changing aspirations would probably have led to a more rigid conversation
 yah bhi chaunkaane vaala he ki film ko lekar zyada hangaamaa khadaa ho jaataa lekin isse kahin adhik hinsak prathaen jaise ki trans bill ko amanviya bataanaa, jo 5 disambar, 2019 ko raashtrapati kii sahmati praapt kar chukaa he, or ab kanoon he

 After the results of the Maharashtra Legislative Council elections, Shiv Sena and BJP have come face to face

 If Ramdas Kadam agreed, the BJP tried to break the Shiv Sena councilors to defeat him
 ramdaas kadam ne kaha he ki wo isaki shikaayat shivasena pramukh bala sahib thakare se karenge
 Two candidates go to the Legislative Council from Mumbai after winning the election and send them to the local municipal corporation
 lekin is baar bijepi ne bhi apana ummidavaar khadaa kar diya
 The BJP had nominated Madhu Chavan as its candidate but lost the election to the Legislative Council
 gauratlab he ki ramdaas kadam is baar vidhansabha chunaav haar gaye the
 It is clear that the way Ramdas is blaming the BJP, it seems that everything is not going well in the bjp-shiv Sena alliance
 isse pehle vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa ko lekar bhi khub haituba machi thi
 The BJP withdrew from the Shiv Sena, saying that it had got more seats in the assembly elections and hence it would be the leader of the opposition in the assembly
 udhar bijepi ke netaaon ne ramdaas kadam ke aaropon ko haasyaaspad bataa rahe hai
 In Nagpur, party leader Vinod Tawde even said that the BJP candidate in Mumbai got ten votes more

 The groom reached the lockup instead of going on a king honeymoon
 gajiabad main shaadi karne aae duulhe raja par aarope he ki wo jyoti naam kii is ladki ko dhokhaa dekar duusari shaadi rachaa rahe the
 a groom named businessman Nitin by profession is now eating the air of the police station
 nitin par aarope he ki isane jyoti naam kii ladki ke saath pehle teen saal tak liv-in-relation rakhe or phir baad main usase shaadi bhi kar lee
 About two years ago, both of them got married in the Arya Samaj Mandir, but today Jyoti came to know that Nitin was preparing to bring a second wife and after learning that she created a ruckus
 police ne jyoti kii shikaayat par duusari shaadi rachaane kaa maamla darj kar liya he
 The groom Raja has also been arrested, the marriage has been stopped
 khabar he ki jis ladki se nitin kii shaadi ho rahi thi wo bhi ab nitin se apni manahani kaa clem vasuulegi
 At the same time, the police are still talking about investigating the case
 duulhe ke parivaar kaa koi sadsy is maamle par koi baat karne ko taiyaar nahin he

 The film is directed by Sam Mendes
 unhone iske pehle 'skyphal' kaa bhi nirdesan kiya tha
 Now will this film be able to provide entertainment to the audience like other Bond films? Let's review the film
 hameshaa kii tarah ek baar phir sejems bond (danniel craig)ek massej milte hi mexico or rome ke mishan par chale jate hai jahaan unki mulaakaat ek criminal kii vidhwaa patni luchia (monica beluchi) se hoti he
 After much identification, Bond discovers a terrible entity called 'spector'
 spector (SPECTRE kaa matlab- Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion he), jiskaa makasad duniya main aatankwaad failaate hue badale kii bhaavana ko badhanaa he
 Meanwhile, the new head of the National Security Center in London, Max Denbig (andrew Scott), objected to a number of questions, questioning Bond's mission
 ab kya bond, spector ke mishan ko khatm kar paaenge? iske liye aapako film dekhni hogi
 The film's shooting locations and the way of action sequences are tremendous
 film kii shuruyaat kaa hi lagbhag 6 minute kaa mexico main 'day of the dead' ek regular parade se, ection sikvence kaa rup lete hue phir shuruyaat ke titals main chalaa jaataa he or titals ke dauraan aapako hindi filmon jaise gane ke bich sabhi ke naam aate hue najar aate hai

 The usual thrilling way is the inclusion of chase sequences and interesting characters

 The weak link of the film is the character of its villain, which could have been written even stronger because a strong villain only enhances the hero of the film
 vahiin film ke kuch sikvence kuch or chote hote to film zyada crisp dikhaai detii
 If you are a fan of Bond films, interested in suspense with action, then definitely watch this film, as well as English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu languages, this film is going to be released

 On Saturday, police arrested two people in Ankleshwar town of Gujarat
 in donon ne ek vyakti ke saath isliye marpet kii kyonki rajput hone ke baavjood vah padmavat film dekhne jane kii baat kar rahaa tha
 According to Upendra Singh Jadhav, a resident of Vadodara, who lodged the complaint, the incident took place on January 24, when he visited Ankleshwar
 shikaayat ke anusaar vah ek hotel main baitha tha or vadodara ke apane ek mitra se baat kar rahaa tha
 He was discussing with her the situation before the release of Padmavat and he told her that the film is not releasing in Gujarat, so he will go to Mumbai to watch the film

 The Delhi Police has managed to catch a multi-faceted killer with the help of tattoos
 police ke paas aaropee tak pahunchane kaa koi suraag nahin tha
 To avoid police, the accused always changed his appearance, but due to the tattoo on his arm, the police recognized him and arrested him
 police ke mutabik 6 june kii der shaam harabir naam kaa ek shaks sharaab kii dukaan par gaya tha
 There he bought liquor for himself
 is dauraan vahaan par ek nepali yuvak bhi tha, usne harveer se kaha ki wo berozegaar or behad garib he
 On this, Harbir also bought liquor for him
 iske baad harabir usee nepali yuvak ke saath ek sunsaan ilaake main sharaab pine chalaa gaya
 According to the police, Harbir had a lot of cash, which was spotted by a Nepali youth and then he tried to snatch money from Harbir
 is par donon ke bich marpet shuru ho gai
 Meanwhile, Harbir picked up a nearby stone and hit it on the head of a Nepali youth
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki harabir ne nepali yuvak ke sir par pathar se kai waar kiye
 Due to this, the Nepali youth died there
 jab is ghatana kii jaankaree police ko hui, to usne jaanch shuru kii, lekin koi suraag nahin mila
 The reason for this was that the accused had neither a criminal record nor the accused and the deceased had ever met before that day

 Through the barcode of the bottle of liquor, the police reached the shop from where the liquor was purchased

 In this footage, the police had also seen the tattoo on Harbir's hand
 haalanki tamaam koshishon ke baad bhi police harabir ko nahin khoj pai thi
 The reason for this was that Harbir used to change his disguise, but one day a policeman at the liquor store saw a tattoo on Harbir's hand and Harbir was caught

 The court sentenced 18-month-old Dholu Mahato, BJP MLA from Baghmara in Jharkhand, to be guilty of obstructing government work
 adaalat ne mahato ko sarkari kaam main baadha daalane or police inspector kii vardi faadane ke maamle main doshi qaraar diya
 Dhanbadki subdivision magistrate Shikha Aggarwal's court on Wednesday convicted Mahato and sentenced him to 18 months in prison
 dhulu mahato ab sajayaftaa vidhayak ho gaye hai
 However, it is a relief for him that the membership of the Jharkhand Legislative Assembly has survived technically
 ve aglaa vidhansabha chunaav bhi lard sakate hai
 What is the whole matter? Dhulu Mahato was accused of freeing Rajesh Gupta from police custody
 vidhayakaur vidhayak samarthakon ke jariye varantee ko chhudaane ke kram main barora ke tatkaaleen thana prabharee arain choudhary kii vardi bhi fat gai thi

 Punishment of five, GR number 2012-03 / 13 related to one Barhulik Dhulu Mahato, Subdivision Magistrate Shiksha Aggarwal had already completed the hearing
 9 oktober faisle kii tithi mukarrar kii gai thi
 The court convicted mlas Dhulu Mahato, Rajesh Gupta, Chunchun Gupta, Rameshwar Mahato and Ganga Gupta, while Basant Sharma was discharged
 adaalat ne paanchon doshiyon ko dedh-dedh varsh kii saadhaaran karawas or 9 hajaar rupee jurmaana se dandit kiya he
 On behalf of the defense, preferred advocates SN Mukherjee, NK Savita, Radheshyam Goswami, Lallan Prasad were advocated

 Also, he cannot contest elections for the next five years after the sentencing period
 is kasuti par sajayaftavidhayakazulu mahato kii sadsyta batch gai he
 Obviously, even after being convicted, Dhulu can now contest the election of Mahtowidhan Sabha

 He has a point
 dilli se meerut pahunchane par agar aap shahar ke andar jane vaale raste ko chhodkar bypass pakaden to donon taraf aap ko bahumanjila imaaraton kii jhaanki najar aegi
 If many buildings are in ready condition, then the foundation brick of many buildings is being laid

 Special care is being taken in the high buildings being built in the city that they should be near the school-college
 aage chalakar bank or aspataal jaisi suvidhaayen bhi is tarah ke parisaron main aaengi
 However, the right sewerage line and drinking water pipeline are still major challenges for such buildings
 itane bade paimaane par nirmaan karne ke baavjood ye donon buniyadi jaruratein bilderon ke agenda main sabase upar nahin dikhaai deteen
 Most colonies are talking about providing boring water, but it is clear from the experience of Gurgaon and Noida that people will eventually have to drink only after purchasing drinking water
 in coloniyon tak pipeline kyon nahin he, is sawaal par meerut ke meyar harikant ahaluwalia ne kaha, ''coloniyon kaa nakshaa paas karne kii jimmedaari meerut vikaas praadhikaran kii he
 There is a need for better co-ordination in this regard and it should be known in advance what kind of plans the corporation has for laying the pipeline
 ''vaise aap kii najar main meerut shahar main sabase badi chunauti kya he? is sawaal par meerut ke saansad rajendra agarwal ne kaha, ''meerut purana shahar he
 The population is dense
 puraane shahar main saaf-safai sunishchit karnaa or atikaraman se nijaat paanaa pehali jarurat or badi chunauti he
 It would be better to keep these issues in mind before building new colonies
 '' jaahir he ki niti niyantaaon kaa kaam hi he doorgaami parinaamon par najar rakhana
 But the first priority of those who book houses in high rise buildings is to invest in such houses at the right time, which should increase in value rapidly

 The priority of home buyers to stay there is better transport, clean environment and safety
 ve aisa ghar chaahate hai jahaan unka parivaar samaa jaae or ghar kii keemat unki jeb ke hisaab se ho
 In such a situation, it is their compulsion to compromise on the remaining issues
 darasal, meerut shahar kii bhugolic sthiti aisi he ki yah ab na sirf pashchimi uttar pradesh kaa pramukh shahar he balki gajiabad or noida ke baad dilli se kareeb sabase bada shahar he
 The way the construction of Rapid Rail Corridor has progressed here, due to this, the distance from Delhi to Meerut will be completed in barely a quarter of an hour

 The Supreme Court is believed to have filed an appeal against the Delhi High Court's decision in which it said that the office of the Chief Justice comes under the purview of the RTI Act
 ucch padasth sutron ne bataaya ki ucch nyaayalay ke 12 janvari ke faisle ke khilaaf apil daayar kii gai he
 This appeal was filed when there was a consensus among the judges of the Supreme Court to challenge the verdict
 sutron ne bataaya ki pradhan nyaayadhish ke ji baalkrishnan ne sheersh adaalat ke anya nyaayadhishon ke saath bhi salaah-mashvira kiya or jo aadhaar usne banaae hai, ve ucch nyaayalay main liye gaye aadhaaron ke samaan hi hai
 In it, he had said that disclosing the information that the CJI has, would affect the independence of the judiciary
 unhone kaha ki atarni general ucchtam nyaayalay registry kii taraf se daleel denge
 The case is expected to be listed for hearing soon
 sutron ne bataaya ki sheersh adaalat ucch nyaayalay ke nirdesh par roak lagane kii maang karegi or vah ise vrahat peeth yaa samvidhan peeth ko saunpane kii daleel degi
 Sources said the appeal was filed after much deliberation as the judges of the apex court initially differed on whether to appeal or not
 ek aitihaasik faisle main dilli ucch nyaayalay ne gat 12 janvari ko kaha tha ki pradhan nyaayadhish kaa karyaalay artiai adhinium ke daayre main aata he
 He rejected the appeal of the Supreme Court, saying that the independence of the judiciary is not a personal privilege of the judge, but he has been given a responsibility
 ucch nyaayalay ke faisle ko pradhan nyaayadhish ke ji baalkrishnan ke liye karaara jhatka mana ja rahaa he jo lagaataar kehete rahe hai ki unka karyaalay artiai adhinium ke daayre main nahin aata he
 Sources said that the apex court will demand a stay on the direction of the High Court and will plead to hand it over to the larger bench or constitution bench
