 The leadership of Himachal Pradesh has definitely become alert on the factionalism in Uttarakhand after slipping power from the khanduri-nishank battle
 lekin purv saansad or rajya ke varisht netaa maheshwar singh kii ore se himachal lokhit party kaa gathan karne or kangra se saansad rajan sushant ko party se nilambit karne ko majaboor hui bhaajapa ab mukhyamantri prem kumaar dhumal ke dhur virdohi shanta kumaar kii sharan main he
 According to BJP sources, the Chief Minister has been made clear that every small and big decision especially related to Kangra should be made with the knowledge and consent of Shanta Kumar
 iske alaava ekajutata ke formule ke tahat shanta kii har baat ko tavajjo dena bhi tay kiya he
 His displeasure is particularly with regard to the working style of ministers
 sutron ke mutabik, shanta bhi dhumal sarkaar main shaamil do mantriyon ko baahar karne kii maang kar rahe hai, jinke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aarope lage hai
 But till now, the leaders who ignore Shanta are constantly talking to him and are trying to end the resentment
 himachal main halaat hu-ba-hu uttarakhand kii tarah hi hai or party ke log hi sarkaar par bhrashtachar ke tamaam aarope laga rahe hai
 The Congress has also started the campaign 'himachal on Sale'
 haalanki party saal ke aakhir main hone vaale himachal vidhansabha kaa chunaav dhumal ke netritv main hi ladegi, lekin apane ghar ko durust karne kaa kaam vakt rahete shuru kar diya he
 BJP General Secretary J
 pi
 Says Nadda, 'there is no difference now
 dhumal ke netritv main ham chunaav ladenge or punjab kii tarah is baar himachal main bhi myth tuutegaa
 We are confident that the BJP will be in power for the second time in a row
 ’rajya bhaajapa main baghawat ke fouran baad rashtriya adhyaksh nitin gadakari ne nadda or sachiv shaam jaju ko hi shimla bhej report mangvayi thi
 After talking to all the leaders of the state, the party had clearly felt that a neutral person should be given the responsibility of the president, otherwise after Uttarakhand, he would have to be ousted from the second power of the mountain

 Chief Minister Dhumal's MP son Anurag Singh Thakur says, 'the matter of controversies has now become an old chapter
 is vakt sab kuch saamaanya he
 'but the only reason for relief for the BJP, which is struggling with its own people at the moment, is the head-foot of Congress, where Union Ministers Virbhadra Singh and Anand Sharma are claiming their respective claims
 haalanki uttarakhand main brahman netritv ko aage badaye jane ke baad himachal main virbhadra hi ekmaatr vikalp hai
 The politics of Brahmin versus Thakur is seen very strongly in Pahar, so the BJP has given every decision right to the state president to bring Maheshwar Singh back to the BJP
 punjab main mili aitihaasik jeet ke baad bhaajapa uttarakhand kii tarah koi jokhim nahin lenaa chaahati, isliye party chhodane waalon ko waapas laane or virdohi gut ko manovl ho rahi he
 But the challenge for the party is to maintain solidarity among all the factions till the election

 The Bharatiya Janata Party's 'ballamar' MLA Akash Vijayvargiya may have got bail from jail, but his discussion is still being discussed everywhere
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne sansadeey dal kii baithak main akaash ko fatkaar lagaai to uskaa asar bhi dikhnaa shuru ho gaya he
 Akash Vijayvargiya is now distancing himself from the media, even he is not coming out of his house
 mangalvaar ko unhen ek baithak main hissaa lenaa tha, lekin unhone isse duuri hi banaai
 On Tuesday, Akash Vijayvargiya was supposed to attend the Bharatiya Janata Party membership campaign committee meeting in Indore, but he is not coming down from his home in Nandanagar
 bataa den ki mangalvaar ko hi pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi akaash se jude maamle par bayaan diya he or apni sakhti dikhaai he
 According to party sources, a show-cause notice will be issued to Akash Vijayvargiya on behalf of the party's disciplinary committee in a week
 akaash ke jawaab ke baad hi party kii taraf se unpar koi faisla liya jayega
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi showed strictness In the meeting of Bharatiya Janata Party's Parliamentary Party held in Delhi, PM Modi showed strictness on the bat scandal of Akash Vijayvargiya
 baithak main piem ne kaha ki kisi kaa bhi betaa ho lekin is tarah kii harakat nahin kerani chahie, unhen party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa dena chahie
 The Prime Minister's strictness did not stop here, he said that the leaders who support such leaders should also show their way out of the party
 piem kii isi sakhti kaa asar dikhnaa shuru bhi ho gaya he
 Explain that on June 26, when the Indore Municipal Corporation officials arrived to break a dilapidated house, Akash Vijayvargiya along with his supporters misbehaved with the corporation officer
 itnaa hi nahin unhone adhikari par balle se hamalaa kiya or unke saath marpet kii
 This video of Akash went viral after which he was arrested by the police
 akaash vijayawargeey ko 14 june kii hiraasat main bhej diya gaya tha, lekin isi ravivaar (30 june) ko unhen zamaanat mil gai thi
 On his return home, his supporters had aerial firing and celebrated fiercely
 piem modi ne akaash kaa swaagat karne waalon par bhi gussa jataayaa he
 Journalists and ordinary people had to wait several days for a glimpse of Lalrang's glittering Mercedes Benz
 yatra ke do din pehle dulhan kii tarah saje jis rath ko media ke saamne pesh kiya gaya wo apni pehali yatra main hi jawaab de gai
 The chariot for which the mercedes-benz chariot Akhilesh Yadav took out from his journey with great enthusiasm, not only decided the auspicious time but according to Vastu, the direction of its exit was also decided
 jis rath ko hari jhandi dikhaane ke liye mulaayam singh yadav or shivpal yadav ko laane ke kadi mashkkat kerani padi, us rath kaa pahiyaa abhi thik se ghumaa bhi nahin tha ki wo tham gaya
 Akhilesh's journey stopped on Lohia path so that despite millions of efforts, it could not slip an inch
 akhilesh yadav kii samaajawaadee vikaas yatra guuruuvaar ko lakhanu ke laa martenior maidan se nikali, mulaayam singh yadav ne ise jhandi dikhaakar ravaanaa kiya lekin ye rath laa martenir maidan se mushkil se aadhe kilometre badha hoga ki isane jabaab de diya
 Akhilesh Yadav was not able to get comfortable in this chariot then, he was able to use the hydraulic lift only once, the same situation was also with Akhilesh's wife Dimple Yadav, who was still trying to make himself comfortable inside the chariot
 That this chariot died
 marcedies par bana ye rath aisa karaab hua ki koi maikenic ise thik nahin kar sakaa or 10 ghante baad bhi ye rath bich sadak par khadaa rahaa or kisi local maikenic se thik nahin ho sakaa
 Local engineers and technical people could not catch the reason for the chariot being bad
 rath ko sahi karne ke liye marcedies company ke export dilli se lakhanu ravaanaa kiye gaye
 The Chief Minister said that this chariot was spoiled because of its driver because the driver applied the hand brake and started driving, causing the clutch plate of this vehicle to burn and the vehicle stopped where it could not move even an inch
 is rath ko chandigarh kii ek company ne na sirf dizin kiya balki ise taiyaar bhi kiya lekin driver kii galati ne rath yatra kii shuruyaat ko hi majaak kaa vishay bana diya
 In the past, this company of Chandigarh has made 4 such chariots for different parties, but Akhilesh Yadav's chariot beat such a fire that now hardly anyone can remove the chariot from such delicate tones
 centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne jab apane aakhri bajet main desh ke 12 karod chote or seemaant kisaanon ko pradhanmantri kisaan sammaan nidhi ke tahat salanaa 6000 rupee dene kaa elaan kiya, to ise aam chunaav se pehle sarkaar kaa masterstroke mana ja rahaa tha
 But now Congress President Rahul Gandhi has announced to increase the monthly income of the poorest 25 crore people of the country to Rs 12000 under the minimum income scheme i
e
 'justice'
 is yojana kaa naam 'nyaay' rakhaa gaya he, jis par kul 3
 60 lakh crore will be spent
 gorakhpur se pradhanmantri kisaan sammaan nidhi kii shuruyaat karte hue pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha tha ki chunaav se pehle congress party karjamaafee ke naam par kisaanon ke bich khayraat baantne kaa vaayada karti he
 But in honor of the farmers of his country 75000 crores a year i
e
 7 in 10 years
 5 lakh karod kharch karegi
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi, while announcing the guarantee of minimum income in his rallies, said that such a scheme is not in the whole world
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha ki pradhanmantri kisaan sammaan nidhi ke tahat sarkaar har kisaan ko rojaanaa 3
 50 rupees
 lekin congress party jo vaayada karne ja rahi he iske tahat desh ke sabase garib 5 karod parivaar yani 25 karod logon kii masik aamadani 12000 rupee karne kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 Rahul Gandhi said that the UPA government brought 14 crore people out of poverty under MNREGA
 ab hamaari aane vaali sarkaar 25 karod logon ko garibi se baahar nikaalegi or yah desh kii garibi par antim prahaar hoga
 Let's look at the highlights of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana and Rahul Gandhi's Minimum Income Guarantee Scheme - Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi: 1
 desh main 2 hectare yani 5 acre tak kii jot vaale kisaanon ko piem kisaan yojana kaa laabh milegaa
 2
 desh main chote or seemaant kisaanon kii sankhya 12 karod he
 3
 piem kisaan yojana ke liye bajet main 75000 karod kii raashi sweekrut kii gai he
 4
 piem kisaan yojana ke tahat panjikrut kisaanon ko 6000 rupee salanaa milenge
 5
 yah raashi 2000 rupee kii 3 kishton main sidhe kisaanon ke khate main di jaaegi
 Congress Minimum Income Guarantee Scheme: 1
 desh ke sabase garib 5 karod parivaar yani 25 karod logon ko nyaay yojana kaa laabh milegaa
 2
 yojana ke tahat har vyakti kii nunatam aay 12000 rupee pratimah kerani he
 3
 matlab agar kisi vyakti kii aay 6000 rupee pratimah he, to sarkaar apni taraf se us vyakti ko 6000 rupee or degi
 4
 desh ke 20 fisadi logon ko is yojana kaa sidhaa laabh milegaa
 5
 anumaan ke mutabik is yojana par lagbhag 3
 60 lakh crore will be spent
 6
 Once the monthly income of a person reaches Rs
 12000, then the benefit of the scheme will stop itself

 If senior advocate Gopal Subramaniam did not become a judge then why should the public suffer
 unke jaj banane se mahangaai to kam nahin ho jaati he
 This request is because on the pretext that everyone should jump into the debate about the appointment of a judge between the executive called the government in Hindi and the judiciary called the court in Urdu
 karypalika or nyaaypalika ke bich ke najuk rishton ko samajhane ke liye
 Only then you or we will be able to see that whether the appointment of a judge can also depend on how the government views him from a political point of view
 aakhir kyon chif justise ko yah kahana padaa ki bharat sarkaar ne unke bheje gaye chaar naamon main se ek ko alag karne kaa jo faisla kiya wo uchit nahin tha or ekatarfa tareeke se aisa kiya gaya

 What happened that the Chief Justice of India had to call for one billion twenty crore Indians
 aaj kii bahes main angreji ke do shabd baar-baar aa sakate hai
 The first is the collegium — it is headed by the Chief Justice of India and besides it four senior judges of the Supreme Court are its members
 jajon kii niyukti yahi collegium karata he
 The second word is segregation- the use of this word will refer to why the government dropped the name of one of the four judges sent to the collegium
 alag matlab unki niyukti kaa aadesh jari nahin kiya
 The case is that the Government of India had segregated the file of the proposal of Gopal Subramaniam to become a judge and approved the appointment of the remaining three judges
 unhen jaj in vatting bana diya gaya
 Gopal Subramaniam saw this as an attack in Hindi on his freedom, professional credibility, honesty and integrity
 wo is baat se khafa the ki 15 may ko ibi se clin chit mil jane ke baad bhi nai sarkaar ke aate hi unke bare main media main khabaren li karain gai
 On these things, on 25 May, Gopal Saheb wrote a letter to the Chief Justice of India and made it public
 9 panne kii is chitthee ke kuch anshon kaa maine apane hisaab se chayan kiya he
 In which Gopal finally says that what has happened in the last few weeks raises a serious apprehension in my mind that the government will not respect the independence of me or the judiciary
 meri samaj yah he ki meri file collegium ke paas punarvichaar ke liye nahin bheji gai
 i think the judiciary has failed to hinder its independence by respecting the likes of the government
 adaalat ko kam se kam itnaa to karnaa chahie ki mujhamen vishwaas vyakt karne jaisaa koi bayaan de
 At least there should be justice with the members of your community
 adaalat agar isamen kaamyaab nahin hoti he to vah ret ke tile main dhans jaaegi
 After returning from abroad on June 28, the Chief Justice has publicly assured that the independence of the judiciary will not be compromised
 koun kar rahaa tha azaadi main dakhal
 The Chief Justice also said that without his consent or knowledge, the government separated Gopal Subramaniam's file
 jabaki collegium ne uttam pratibha kaa chunaav kiya tha
 Is this answer sufficient for Gopal Subramaniam
 chif justise ne yah bhi kaha ki gopal subramanyam ne apni baat saarvajanik kar thik nahin kiya he
 On 6 May, the names of four individuals were referred to the Supreme Court judge
 lekin sarkaar badalte hi media main khabaren aati hai ki sarkaar ne teen naamon par manzuri di or gopal subramanyam kii file roak lee
 Because the IB and CBI have adverse remarks against them
 is khabarbaazi se gopal subramanyam aahat hote hai or chif justise se sampark karte hai chif justise unhen 28 june tak rukne ke liye kehete hai taaki ve videsh se laut aaen
 Gopal writes in the letter that if the name is not withdrawn, the appointment of the three judges accompanying him will become doubtful
 ve is propaganda se aahat hai
 The IB gave me a clean cheat on 15 May
 mujhe logon or collegium kii nigaah main shankaa paidaa karne ke liye badnaam kiya ja rahaa he
 If i had any doubt then why did the Supreme Court make me an amicus curiae on many delicate issues
 emicas cure ko aap hindi main madadgaar vakil kah sakate hai
 Why did the IB and CBI keep me as top lawyers
 meri samaj main soharabuddin banaam gujarat sarkaar jaise maamalon main suzav dene ke chalate sarkaar nishaanaa bana rahi he
 Gopal has written that the government feels that they will not follow his line
 sarkaar ne sutron se bulawaaya ki vah nyaaypalika kii swatantraaa kaa sammaan karti he
 The names of candidates have also been separated earlier
 2009 main swatantra kumaar or sike prasad ke naam kaa suzav aayaa tha tab sirf swatantra kumaar ko hi manzuri mili thi
 Whether or not these examples propagated by sources can be compared to the Gopal Subramaniam case is also a question
 jin justise sike prasad kaa sarkari sutron ne udhaaharan diya he unki file disbanr 2009 main zarur roki gai thi, magar us file ko collegium ke paas bheja tha
 The collegium stood by its opinion and in February 2010 Justice CK Prasad became a judge of the Supreme Court
 justise sike prasad aaj usee collegium ke sadsy hai jisane gopal subramanyam kaa chunaav kiya tha
 Did the government seek any opinion from the Chief Justice or the Collegium, has the government interfered in the independence of the judiciary by preventing anyone from becoming a judge for political reasons
 gopal ne naam waapas le liya magar jo sawaal chhod gaye hai kya ve bhi waapas liye ja sakate hai

 ) The demand for speedy justice on the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old paramedical student in the capital cannot be met as no lawyer is ready to represent the six accused in court
 aropiyon main se ek kii ames main bone dencity jaanch karwaai gai he ki vah naaballig he yaa nahin, jiskaa parinaam 7 janvari ko aane vaala he
 Although the police have done a wonderful job by preparing a charge sheet against those six within just two weeks, but the experts of the law believe that if no lawyer is represented, then the accused will benefit only even further when the case starts hearing
 If it is there, water can revive the whole process police kaa daawa he ki yah bilkul ksaa hua maamla he jisamen 30 gavaah shaamil hai or lagbhag 1,000 pannon kaa aarope patr taiyaar hua he
 The case will be heard everyday in the fast track court
 lekin saket jila adaalat baar association main 2 janvari ko kiya gaya yah faisla ki aropiyon ko koi madad nahin di jaaegi, sari taiyaari ko kund kar saktaa he
 Experts feel that the same situation may arise in this case which happened to Ajmal Kasab, accused of 26 / 11 terror attack

 Ramachandran gives the example of Muhammad Hussain, a Pakistani citizen accused of a 1997 bomb blast in West Delhi

 The Supreme Court ordered a re-hearing of the case in September 2012, canceling it after 15 years, despite receiving death sentences from the lower court and the Delhi High Court, as it believed that the trial courts in the lower courts did not comply
 was done
 us samay bhi vakeelon ne uske liye pairvi karne se inkaar kar diya tha
 Ramachandran says, "lawyers should not take any ethical step with regard to not advocating for anyone
 ” ve poochhate hai ki aakhir samuhik dushkarm ke aropiyon kii pairvi na karne kaa faisla lekar ve kiski madad kar rahe hai
 Advocate Abbas Kazmi, who advocated Kasab in the lower court, believes that this view of the bar association will unduly delay the hearing
 ve kehete hai, “indira gandhi or rajeev gandhi ke hatyaron kii pairvi bhi desh ke sabase kaabil vakeelon ne kii thi

 In compulsion, this family stopped planting crops

 But this year, Jia Lal put solar fence in the fields which stopped the animals from entering the field
 darasal, pichley kuch varshon se junglee jaanwaron kii vajah se kisaanon ko kaaphi nuksaan ho rahaa tha
 According to the report of the Department of Agriculture and Horticulture, 1 in Himachal Pradesh

 K
 singh kaa kahana he, "hamaare yahaan tab logon ne isamen ruchi nahin dikhaai jab kharch 60 or 40 ke anupaat main diya ja rahaa tha
 But immediately after 80 percent subsidy, people started applying it
 ''junglee jaanwaron se fasal ko bachaane ke liye kai paaramparik tareeke apanaae gaye
 But all conservation efforts were unsuccessful when solar fences were seen as a good option
 fasal suraksha ke liye saura sanchalit baad ko pulcing ke saath vidyutkrit kiya gaya he, jisase baad ko chune vaale jaanavar ko ek bijli kaa jhatka lagata he

 Neither for humans, nor for animals

 ) Odisha government schools will have additional classes of Science, Math and English
 ye kavayad sarkari skulon main rigelt sudhaarney ke liye kii ja rahi he
 The Government of Odisha announced this on Tuesday and said that these efforts are being made to build a strong hold on these subjects among children
 sarkaar kii taraf se kaha gaya ki vartmaan main 45 minute kii class hoti he
 Now the class of these three subjects will be of 90 minutes
 ye shikshan samay odisha ke sabhi rajkeey skulon main lagu hoga
 State Education Minister Sameer Ranjan Das told in the press conference that this decision has been taken after reviewing the performance of students in these subjects
 unhone kaha ki angreji, vigyaan or ganit jaise vishyon main bacchon kaa pradarshan thodaa kamjor he
 That is why we have decided to double the teaching time of these subjects to focus more on these subjects
 iskaa matlab he ki ab is tarah se skulon main padhaane kii samay saarini taiyaar hogi ki anya vishyon ko 45 minute kaa shikshan samay (dainik) milegaa, vahiin in teen vishyon ko dedh ghante kaa samay milegaa
 Sameer Das said that now students will spend more time on these subjects
 in shikshakon ke saath adhik baatcheet karenge or apane basic ko clear kar lenge
 At the same time, education experts say that this step may not lead to much desired results
 samay ko doguna karne se koi aisa asar nahin padane vaala, jab tak ki bacchon kaa usamen interest na ho
 Vinay Pattanayak, a former UNICEF education expert, told The Indian Express that the lessons of these subjects should be interesting and activity-based from a student's perspective
 shikshak kii taiyaari bacchon ke sikhaane kii disha main sakasham hone kii jarurat he
 Other experts pointed to the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2018 on children's learning outcomes in rural Odisha
 jisamen padhane or ganit kaushal main kai asamanthaayen dikhaai gayi
 For example, in Raigad, only 5 in class VI-VIII
 4 fisadi bachche divijan ke sawaal kar sakate the, jabaki sirf 40 fisadi se adhik kaksha ii-level kaa paath pard sakate the
 48 in Puri
 8% divijan yani vibhaajan ke sawaal kar sakate the, jabaki 80% se adhik students ek hi paath pard sakate the
 According to data from Education Report 2018, there is a shortage of good teachers to teach maths or science in schools in rural areas of the state
 RTE forum ke kanvinar anil pradhan ne kaha ki rajya ke sarkari skulon main shikshakon kii anupasthiti or achche classroom kii kami ko dur karne par focus karen to rigelt main khud sudhaar dikhaai degaa
 He said that earlier weak students used to take tuition or coaching but nowadays many meritorious students are taking expensive coaching by taking dummy admission in schools
 isse shiksha kaa vyavsaayeekaran bad rahaa he
 The central government should set up the National Education Regulatory Authority to control it
 jisase skulon main hi pravesh parikshaon kii taiyaari karwaane jaise suzav maane jaaen
 The level of education in government schools is falling due to the government's neglect

 RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, jailed in the Fodder Scam case, has received another major blow from the Supreme Court
 supreme court ne lalu prasad yadav kii jamaanat yachika khaarij kar di he
 The decision of the Supreme Court for Lalu Prasad Yadav is also the biggest blow because it will be the first time since 1977 that Lalu Prasad Yadav will not be involved in any election campaign
 yani 1977 ke baad yah pehla mauka he jab lalu prasad yadav chunaav prachaar main bhaag nahin lenge
 Let me tell you that Lalu Prasad campaigned for his party in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and Bihar assembly elections in 2015, however, at that time he came out of jail on bail
 darasal, lalu prasad yadav ne swasthya kaa hawala dete hue court se jamaanat maangi thi
 But the CBI had opposed the bail plea of lalu Prasad Yadav by presenting an affidavit in the Supreme Court
 sibiai ne kaha tha ki lalu yadav loksabhaa chunaav (lok Sabha Election) ke liye jamaanat maang rahe hai
 Many things will be new after the Supreme Court Judgment
 masalan, 1977 ke baad jab lalu prasad yadav pehali baar chunaav lade the or saaran se saansad ke rup main chune gaye the, chunaav prachaar nahin kar paaenge
 He was disqualified for his involvement in the fodder scam, which prevented him from contesting the election, but was involved in campaigning for his party in the 2014 elections and the 15 assembly elections
 itnaa hin hin, jab tak chaara ghotaalaa ke hi ek maamle main sibiai kii special court main doshi paae gaye lalu prasad yadav ko hai court bari nahin kar detaa, tab tak lalu prasad yadav kaa jail se baahar nikalnaa kaaphi mushkil he
 Let us know that Lalu Prasad has been convicted in three cases related to the fodder scam worth over nine hundred crores
 ye maamle 1990 ke dashak main, jab jharkhand bihar kaa hissaa tha, dhokhe se pashupaalan vibhaag ke khajaane se dhan nikaalane se sambandhit hai
 Lalu Prasad had cited his age and declining health for bail in the High Court, stating that he was suffering from diabetes, blood pressure and various other ailments and had already got bail in a case related to the fodder scam
 rajd supremeo ko jharkhand main sthit devgarh, dumka or chibasa ke do koshagaar se chal se dhan nikaalane ke aparaadh main doshi tehraaya gaya he
 At present, he is under trial in connection with the withdrawal of funds from Doranda treasury

 shaayad vah hawa kii gati or disha ko samajhane main puri tarah asafal rahe

 ) IP University based in Delhi told the Supreme Court on Wednesday that the university is withdrawing the notification of special counseling on August 28
 iskaa sidhaa matlab yah he ki special counselling radd ho jaaegi
 Significantly, under the Supreme Court rules, no college can be admitted after August 15
 iske baavjood ypi uniwarsity ne special counselling ke liye 28 agast kaa notification jari kiya tha
 According to this notification, students who have enrolled in a college of IP University could also participate in this counseling
 ise dekhte hue association of self financing institute ne ypi uniwarsity ke khilaaf court main yachika daayar kii thi
 It is an association of private colleges recognized by IP University
 yachikakarta ke vakil camel gupta ke mutabik counselling ke liye uniwarsity kii ore se jari notification par roak lagane ke liye yachika daayar kii gai thi
 Let me tell you that three rounds of counseling have already been done in IP University and the university had decided to conduct special counseling for about 6 thousand seats lying vacant in colleges
 ypi uniwarsity main har saal 4 se 6 hazaar siten khaali rah jaati hai
 The reason for this is more seats and less students
 special counselling se aise collejon ko nuksaan hota jinaki zyaadaatar siten bhar chuki hai kyonki is counselling main un chaatro ko bhi hissaa lene ke ijazat thi jo pehle se daakhila le chuke hai
 In this case, the petitioner had earlier filed an application in the High Court, but after the petition was dismissed from the High Court's double bench, an application was filed in the Supreme Court
 ypi uniwarsity main kul 6200 siten khaali hai or ye siten 10 alag-alag corson main hai
 To fill them, a process of special counseling has been started
 is maamle main counselling ke baad abhi tak admician list nahin ai he
 At present, the Supreme Court has banned the special counseling being conducted in IP University and has asked the government to file an answer on the petition in this case
 dadri ke bisaheda gaanv main ravivaar ko do sagi bahanon kaa nikaah hua
 The communal spectacles with which Dadri was being watched for 15 days broke the spectacles with this wedding
 dhoomdhaam se hui is shaadi ne gaanv kii raunak lautaa di
 In Bishera village, the drenching of mist started
 gaanv kii resham or jaitoon kaa nikaah ho gaya
 Who had anticipated that an incident of September 28 would put such a wretched shadow on the village that in the eyes of the world, the village would be cut off by the sword of mere glory
 lekin resham or jaitoon kaa nikaah hua, to gaanv main raunak bhi lauti or bharosa bhi
 The golden opportunity to wash the spots The marriage of both the daughters of Mohammad Hakim of Gurgaon was done on the same day
 ek duulhaa paas ke gaanv payawali kaa rahane vaala he, to doosraa sadullahpur kaa
 There was complete preparation for the wedding of both the grooms
 rishtedaar khush the, par chaar din pehle tak yah tay nahin tha ki ab bisaheda main shaadi ho bhi paaegi yaa nahin
 For the villagers, this marriage was not a mere marriage
 gaanv ke naam par lage dhabbe ko dhone kaa yah behatar mauka tha
 This marriage was a message to the Dashahatgars and Siyasadans
 siyasatdanon ke liye sabakreshma or jaitoon kii shaadi sirf isliye ahm nahin thi ki bisaheda main sampradayik tanaav ke baad shaadi ho saki
 Actually, this marriage was important because Hindu families took the pledge to get this marriage done with pomp
 shaadi sampradayik sadbhaav kii misaal ban gai
 In a way, lessons for those Dalits and political supporters that their efforts to divide the society cannot be successful
 nonvej kaa intjaam nahinshaadi ke liye bufe main rasagulle, butter paneer, jalebi, chaaval, chhole, chapatti jaise tamaam vyanjan bane, to use banavaane kii jimmedaari mohammad hakim ne hindu mitra ko di
 Non -ways were not arranged so that Hindu sentiments were not hurt
 ganga-jamani tahjeeb ke taar majbootadrasal, bisaheda main hui shaadi ne ganga-jamani tahjeeb ke us taar ko majboot kiya, jahaan hindu-musalmaan sirf khuda ko yaad karne ke tareeke se alag hai, varanaa rahete bhi saath hai or khate bhi saath hai
 Politics turned hindu-muslims on the chessboard, but the hindu-muslims of the village resurrected the hope that killing a person cannot kill the entire village of humanity

 After joining hands with Janat dal-united (JD-U) and Nitish Kumar, when it felt that the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) was getting some political bias in Bihar, then Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav, MP, RJD chief on the party and the alliance Lalu Prasad Yadav's control has raised questions
 loksabhaa main argedy ke chaar saansadon main se ek pappu ne apane party adhyaksh ko salaah di he ki ve apni 'raah sudhaar len' varanaa party praasangik nahin rah paaegi
 He has dealt with great displeasure and advised Lalu to stop relying on opportunists in the party
 lalu ke donon beton tej pratap yadav or tejasvi yadav par party ke varisht netaaon ke prati 'apmanjanak vyavhaar' kaa aarope lagane se lekar unki beti misa bharti or beton ko argedy kaa star prachaarak banane par sawaal uthaane tak pappu kii tikhi chitthiyon ne party ke bheetar sulagate asantosh ko hawa de di he
 Although Pappu Yadav has tried to avoid challenging Lalu's authority in both the letters, he seems to have questioned Lalu's legacy over his children's claim
 kisi bhi party kii tarah argedy ne bhi apane netritv ke khilaaf party main virodh ko kuchlaa he
 a person hoping to stay in the RJD cannot dare to challenge Lalu or question his family
 lekin pappu ne ye donon kaam kiye hai
 Yet the RJD has not yet whipped this MP from Madhepura
 lagata he, lalu abhi pappu se puri tarah niraash nahin hai yaa abhi koi kadam nahin uthaanaa chaahate
 Pappu wrote the first letter a few days after the Lok Sabha elections and the second in November 2014
 vaise ab tak unhen koi jawaab nahin mila he
 Whatever is written in letters, in the traditional political scenario, writing a letter is considered a disagreement and a readiness to fly elsewhere
 varisht samaajawaadee netaa shivanand tiwari ne chitthee likhakar hi lalu yaa nitish ke netritv ke khilaaf vidroh kii shuruyaat kii thi
 Now Jayanthi Natarajan has also written a letter to Sonia Gandhi before leaving the Congress

 Nitish was also looking for crutches when the JD (U) 's number of mps dropped from 20 to two in the last Lok Sabha election
 aktubar main nirdhaarit vidhansabha chunaav se pehle bijepi se nibatane ke liye lalu or nitish do dashakon kii kadavaahat bhula kar haath mila chuke hai
 Earlier, before the JD (U) -BJP alliance, Lalu lost the elections but the rjd's vote percentage always kept him in the race
 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhi jab argedy ko sabase kam 22 siten milin or 243 sadasyeey sadan main vah 10 fisadi siten bhi nahin paa sakaa, tab bhi use 18
 84 percent i
e
 more than 54 lakh votes were received
 yah sankhya acchhee-khaasi thi par bijepi-jedy (you) ke abhedya dikhne vaale gathbandhan se takkar lene ke liye paryaapt nahin thi
 The separation between BJP and JD (U) raised hopes that Lalu's fate might be reversed in the Lok Sabha elections, but this did not happen
 bijepi ke netritv main endie ko 31 siten milin, lalu ko chaar or nitish ko sirf do se santosh karnaa padaa
 Now with the coming of nitish-lalu, it is expected that these regional sultans will stay in front of the saffron storm
 agast 2014 main 10 siton par hue vidhansabha upachunaav main lalu-nitish gathjod ne congress ke saath milakar 6 siten jeetin or bijepi ko sirf chaar siten milin
 But Pappu has put a mess
 ve aise vakt main apni aazaadee kaa paracham laharaa rahe hai jab lalu-nitish bijepi ke saamne majboot morcha khadaa karne main jute hai
 Both know that if the election results are not in their favor, then their brilliant political life will be blocked
 karo yaa maro ke is chunaav se pehle donon kii najar sirf pakad majboot karne par tiki he
 But Pappu's silent rebellion is sucking his life
 pappu ne 66 varshiya lalu par aise najuk samay main waar kiya he jab pichley saal dil kaa oparation karaane ke baad ve ab apni kisi santan ko uttaradhikari ghoshit karne kii soch rahe honge
 He cannot contest elections as he is convicted in the fodder scam
 sabaki nigahen is baat par tiki hai ki ve apni jagah kise chunenge
 His daughter, elder son Tej, and younger son Tejashwi, who have lost the last Lok Sabha election, are said to be in this race
 lekin apane bacchon ko netritv saunpane ke lalu ke faisle par pappu ne sawaal uthaaya he
 This may undermine the power transfer in the party
 pappu bakhubi jaanate hai ki jis party main lalu kaa hukum aakhri hota he, use ve gatak nahin sakate
 But he sees a chance that he can become a political icon of the larger Yadav community, and in the coming years, he can take the form of a new messiah of right, social justice only in a few districts
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main unhone apana kad bada kiya he
 Pappu and Ranjit Ranjan (congress) won the title of the only couple elected in the Lok Sabha even when the whirlwind of Narendra Modi swept Bihar
 yah choti uplabdhi nahin he
 Lalu will have to extinguish the smoldering sparks within the party as some party people are secretly airing Pappu's arguments
 vaise to paanch baar saansad rahane ke baad bhi pappu kaa prabhaav uttar-bihar ke kosi-simanchal ilaake tak simit dikhaai detaa he
 They have won thrice from Purnia and twice from Madhepura
 teen dashak kii siyaasi jindagi main pehali baar aisa hua he ki pappu ne aisa mukaam hasil kar liya he ki rajya main kuch lagaam unke haath main he
 This time, soon after he became an MP, his rising stature was noticed when he ordered state doctors to reduce fees for screening or treating poor patients
 aisa na karne par unhone andolan kii chetavanee di thi
 The warning reminded of the bygone era of Bahubali who contested the Lok Sabha election after being acquitted by the Patna High Court in May 2013 in the Ajit Sarkar murder case
 pappu ne ek or chatur chaal chali he
 He has become a staunch supporter of Jitan Ram Manjhi, while Lalu is understood to have agreed to remove Manjhi to a large extent so that Nitish rejoins the Chief Minister's throne as per the wishes of many JD (U) leaders
 pappu ne india today ko bataaya, ''jeethanram maanjhi ko hataane kii maang karne vaale log gaiyr-jimmedaar hai
 They will definitely be fueled by some big leaders
 nahin to unamem vah sab kehane kii himmat nahin thi, jo ve kahana chaahate hai
 Manjhi ji should be allowed to remain the chief minister till the assembly elections are held
 "it seems Pappu's intention is to mobilize the Scheduled Castes and Yadavs behind Manjhi's support
" aisa ho saktaa he ki pad se hataae jane ke baad maanjhi khud ko trast dikhaane kii koshish karen or agar unhone pappu se haath mila liya to vidhansabha chunaav ke baad bihar main unki boli bad sakati he

 Soon after Sonia's brief meeting with the speaker, the Congress made it clear that the party's demands for discussion on demonetisation and the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Rajya Sabha under the ballotting rule in the Lok Sabha have not softened

 meri maa ne mujhe sachai or dayavan hone kii ahmiyat sikhaai he
 He has amazing stamina and has an unwavering belief in prophecy, he is very optimistic
 ve bhi sabase zyada padhi-likhi shakhsiyat hai, jinhen main jaanati hum
 i think i have taught my mother a little bit of all these things
 maine siikhaa ki kaise apane sadhano ke hisaab se karch kaise karnaa he
 He has taught me to live in this world with and without means
 main apni maa jaise kisi or insaan ko nahin jaanata
 Tolerant and stubborn to the extent that he spent all his life with love, honor and pride, rather than kneeling before the test of time
 aaj mere paas jo kuch bhi he vah sab unka hi diya hua he
 And everything i own now belongs to them
 meri maa ke kaaran hi dizine main mujhe dilchaspee hui
 In music, dance and any creative work
 unhone mujhe ek alag nazariye se duniya ko dekhnaa sikhaaya
 They encouraged me to always do what makes me happy and keep growing up as i learn
 ve ek teacher ke taur par ritair huin or ritair hone ke baad, unhone painting karnaa siikhnaa shuru kar diya he
 And every time she sends me her new painting, i feel very happy
 ek baat jo maine apni maa se sikhi he jisane mujhe apane vyaktitv ko sanvaarane main madad kii he, wo yah he ki sachai, eemaandaaree or kadi mehnat ke badale doosraa koi rasta nahin he
 Secondly, what they taught me is that do not leave a single grain of food in your plate, do not waste food and eat whatever you have been served
 apane zindagi ke is padaav par bhi main abhi bhi unki seekhon kaa anusaran kar rahaa hum or aage bhi karti rahuungi
 i only believe in truth, honesty and hard work
 plate main ek bhi dana nahin chhodane kaa kaaran yah he ki ham kisaanon ke parivaar se hai
 We know how much effort and effort is required to grow a grain of rice and bring the same grain from farm to home
 kisaan hone ke naate ham jaanate hai ki ann ke dane kii ahmiyat or qeemat kya hote he
 This is one of the reasons why they taught us the price of food and not to waste it

 desh bullate train ke daur main pahunchane vaala he
 But the Mail Express trains in East Central Rail have an average speed of about 40 km per hour
 aap isse andaja laga sakate hai ki kis raftaar se aap apane lakshya tak pahunchate hai
 Surprisingly, the speed of goods trains is more than Mail Express
 hairaan kar dene vaale ye aankade purv madhya railway ki taraf se jari kiye gaye hai
 In every budget of the railway, you must have heard many claims of high speed trains in the country
 lekin trainon kii raftaar par ai ek haalia report aapako chaunkaa degi
 According to the report, the average speed of trains in the country is just 44 km / h
 yahi nahin kai jone jisamen purv madhya railway hajipur bhi shaamil he, usamen melexpress trenonki ausat raftaar 40 kilometre yaa phir usase kam he, jo rashtriya ausat ko bhi puraa nahin kar pate hai
 Why is the speed of trains, Rajesh Kumar, the chief public relations officer of East Central Railway, says that there are many reasons behind the decrease in the average speed of trains in the country
 pramukh vajahon main sabase pehle he sonpur mandal or samastipur mandal main adhikansh linon kaa single hona
 Rajesh Kumar said that the maximum permissible speed in it is less than 100 km / h
 kahin kahin to 60 km / h yaa 80 km / h raftaar he
 Apart from this, due to the unmanned railway crossing in many places, we run trains on cushion from the point of view of safety
 rajesh kumaar ne kaha ki in vajahon se hitrenon kii speedka ausat, rashtriya ausat se thodaa kam he
 However, the East Central Railway Mail is trying to increase the speed of express trains
 malgadiyon kii raftaar behatarvaise purv madhya rail main malgadiyon kii ausat raftaar desh ke ausat raftaar se behatar he
 The goods trains run at high speed
 purv madhya railway ek lodingrelvehai or railway kaa jo aay he, wo mukhyat: malgadiyon se hota he
 So the average speed of goods trains is better
 railway kaa kahana he ki jaise hi dedicated coridor ban kar taiyaar ho jayega, mail express trainon kii gati main sudhaar ho jayega

 Sitting in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (pok), the terrorists are trying to trick Kashmiri youth through social media and other means and try to push them in the path of terror
 par unke in mansoobon ko hamaari suraksha agenciyaan kaamyaab nahin hone de rahi hai

 oktober ke maheene main 33 sthaneey yuvaaon ko aatank kii raah aatankiyon ne dikhaai he
 At the same time, if the sources are to be believed, in the month of October last year, only 10 local Kashmiri youths were able to succeed in terror

 Even though the terrorists are trying to recruit terrorists on a large scale in the Jammu region, the operation is going on against the terrorists and terrorists are constantly piling up
 kashmir ghati main ek taraf yuvaaon ko bargala kar bhartee karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he vahiin duusari taraf surakshabal in aatankiyon ke khilaaf oparation bhi kar rahi hai
 However, they are also given a chance to join the mainstream, but instead of joining the terrorist mainstream, they are engaged in working as a hanger of Pakistan

 He has been a part of all the important processes of the Rafale deal
 vah rafel anubandh vaarta samiti (siensi) ke shuruaati pramukh bhi rahe
 The contract was finalized under the current head of the training command and the country's deputy air force chief
 bataa den ki congress rafed saude ko lekarbijepiur pradhanmantri narendra modi ko aksar gherti najar aati he
 The Congress has held more than 100 press conferences across the country on the Rafale issue
 iske alaava congress kii kor cameti ne adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke saath milakar baithak bhi kii
 The party made a plan to surround the Modi government in the meeting
 france media ne bhi uthaae the rafel par sawalis saude par haal hi main france media ne bhi sawaal uthaaya tha
 The French media compared the ongoing Rafale 'scam' controversy in India to the Bofors scandal in the 1980s, raising the question of how the private sector, which began in 2007, was ousted from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in 2015
 That Reliance Defense was included? What are the allegations of the Congress? The Congress claims that the UPA Government had dealt the same aircraft, the Modi Government was given three gun Price is buy
 congress kaa aarope he ki is nai deal main kisi bhi tarah kii technology ke transfar kii baat nahin hui he
 According to former defense minister AK Antony, according to the deal of the UPA government, 18 out of 126 aircraft were to be built in France and the rest were to be built in India by HAL
 aisa prathit hota he ki ensipineta sharad pavaar (sharad Pawar) ke parivaar main lambey samay se chal rahi kalah kaa phayda bhaajapa netritv ne uthaaya or antim samay main congress, rakanpa or shivasena gathbandhan dwaara sarkaar banane kaa daawa karne se thik pehle ratorat puure ghatnakram ko palat diya, mukhyamantri or up mukhyamantri kaa aaj hua shapathgrahan bhaajapa ke varisht netaaon or ajit pavaar ke bich kai dinon tak chali baatcheet kaa nateeja he
 The cases of corruption against Ajit Pawar are being investigated by central agencies
 bhaajapa ke kendriya netritv ne party mahasachiv or pradesh chunaavon main party prabharee rahe bhupendra yadav ko apni yojana ko amali jama pehanaane or fadanvis ke saath jamini str par samanvay kii yojana ko kriyanvit karne ke liye mumbai bheja
 It was decided to form the government as soon as possible to not allow the efforts of the Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP coalition government to go ahead
 bhaajapa netaaon kaa maananaa tha ki satta kii chahat kai nirdaleey vidhayakon or virdohi dhade ke netaaon ko apane paksh main karne main madadgaar hogi
 As the leader of the NCP Legislature Party, Ajit Pawar took letters of support from the party mlas and used them to support the bjp's claim to form the government
 ensipi netaa nawab malik ne kaha ki yah patr shivasena-rakanpa or congress gathbandhan ke sarkaar gathan ke daawey ke samarthan ke liye the
 Senior BJP leaders refused to comment on whether Sharad Pawar was aware of them all
 unhone shivasena ke netritv vaale gathbandhan ke samarthan kii pushti karte hue kaha ki unke bhattije ne apane man se yah kadam uthaaya he
 Shiv Sena, Rakampa and Congress had been trying to form an impossible-to-find alliance since last week, while the BJP was quiet during this period
 haalanki, ab lagata he ki usne pavaar ke bhattije ajit pavaar ko shaamil karne kaa ‘‘plan bi'' taiyaar rakhaa tha
 The Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP finalized the alliance on Friday night to form the government, and were scheduled to meet the Governor on Saturday
 congress netaa mallikarjun khadge ne kaha ki shuukravaar shaam ko yahaan nehru centre main hui teenon dalon kii baithak main ajit pavaar bhi maujuud the
 However, the President's rule in the state on November 12 was removed at 5
47 am today (saturday)
 iske baad shanivaar subah hi saadhe saat baje devendra fadanvis ne mukhyamantri or rakanpa vidhayak dal ke netaa ajit pavaar ne up mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee
 Now the point to be seen is how Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar prove majority in the assembly? a Congress leader told pti-bhasha on condition of anonymity that his party was skeptical that if an alliance between the congress-ncp-shiv Sena did not take place, a section of NCP could join hands with the BJP is
 congress netaa ne aarope lagaaya, “bhaajapa kaa sheersh netritv (rakanpa netaa) prafull patel ke madhyam se koshish kar rahaa tha ki sharad pavaar bhaajapa ke saath aa jaaen
 They said that this would help Patel and Ajit Pawar in the Enforcement Directorate's investigation
 ” sutron ne bataaya ki pavaar parivaar main pichley kuch maheenon se chal rahi takaraar main ek taraf ajit pavaar the or duusari taraf sharad pavaar or unki beti supriya sule
 The controversy grew over ticket distribution during the Lok Sabha elections and assembly elections, when Sharad Pawar decided to go to the ed's office and workers from across the state started coming to Mumbai, Ajit Pawar was absent
 usee shaam unhone vidhayak pad se istipha de diya
 This was considered an attempt to divert attention
 agle din ajit pavaar ne ankhon main aansu bharkar media se kaha ki unhone isliye istipha diya kyonki idi ne maharashtra rajya sahakaari bank ghotaale main na sirf unka balki sharad pavaar kaa naam bhi liya

 So he rode his horse, took the son along, loaded the sack of grain, and walked towards the city

 Ride yourself, have kept the son as well and from above, have also loaded the sack

 Sitting quietly on horseback, he lifted the son from horseback and took him in his lap
 kuch hi dur gaye the ki ek duusare gaanv vaale ne dekha ki buddhuraam ghode par, bete ko god main uthaae, chale ja rahe hai
 He asked- what is this, Buddharam? Buddharam explained that the horse did not have much burden, so he took the child in his lap
 gaanvvaale ne hans kar kaha- buddhuraam, lekin bori to bachche se bhi zyada baari he
 You have put it on the horse too
 buddhuraam soch main pad gaye
 Finally, they put the sack on their head, lift the child in their lap and ride forward on a horse

 lekin bahut saare log abhi bhi kuch search karne ke liye pehle browsar main jaakar Google
 Type com, write the search you want to do after Google's page opens, and then search
 phaltu hi mehnat he ye!chrome Browser khud main hi google search he
 That is, instead of opening Google's site, type what you want to search directly here and press the Enter button
 Chrome ke bheetar hi 'google search' chipa hua he
 That means if you aajtak in Chrome
 com tip karenge to ye 'ajtak' kii website khol degaa or agar aap sirf aajtak tip karke search karenge to ye aajtak ko google par search karke khoj nikaalega
 There is no need to think about capital and small letters while writing for Spelling Mistake Chalagogal Search
 aap IIT Kanpur likh kar search karen yaa iit kanpur - baat ek hi he
 Similarly, Google corrects the mess of small spelling
 Spelling thik-thik yaad nahin to zyada pareshaan mat hon
 Why should calculator How powerful calculator is hidden within Google search, you can not imagine
 jinka maths main haath tang ho unhen agar calculator dekar bhi poocha jaae ki 34962 kaa 23
 How much is 5 percent, it will probably be difficult
 lekin google search main bas likh kar dekhen 23
 5 percent of 34962
 google search hi sabase bada calculator he
 Write whatever you want to add, subtract, calculate, right here (eg 785 + 456 + 1386 + 1654) and the answer will be there
 ye sochane tak kii jarurat nahin ki koun si cheez kelculet karne ke liye kya batan dabaanaa he
 Just write your question directly in Google search like- square root of 45689
 tri karke dekhen- calculator hameshaa ke liye bhul jaaenge
 Tell the dollar, the rate of the rupee pauldollar varies every day - how far to remember! Whether to convert meters to feet, inches to centimeters or dollars to rupees - there is no need to download any App for any conversion

 That is, type directly into the Google search - 175 meter in feet
 yaa phir likhen 265 dollar in rupee, yaa phir 127 centimeter in inch
 Isn't it easy? Keep the sweater or not
 Going to Singapore in holidays and confused whether hot clothes will be required or not? Type in Google search - weather in singapore - not just today, the weather of the next seven days in Singapore will be in front of you

 Do not run, relax !! Flights are common in winter
 lekin baar baar airlines ke helpline par phone karne kii jarurat nahin he

 aapako time ke saath saath us jagah kaa time jone bhi pataa chal jayega
 First Day, First Show If you are a fan of films, then on a holiday, first of all you would like to know what are the show timings of your favorite film in theaters around the house
 google search main bas apni film kaa naam daal kar search karen
 The first result that will be seen will be around you, in which theater, what is the show time of that film
 lekin iske liye jaruri he ki aapkaa phone yaa compauter wi-fi se kancted ho yaa phir aapane apane phone main Location Services ko ON kar rakhaa ho
 If you want to know the show of the film in some other place, then write the name of the area and the city along with the name of the film - like jackpot noida sector 18
 agar aap sirf showtimes likh kar search karenge to aas paas ke cinemagharon main koun koun si film chal rahi he uskaa puraa byoraa aapke saamne hoga
 c - a -T Cat - Cat means there is no need to download a dictionary in the catphone

 Do you want to impress someone who speaks another language by writing something in their language? In google search, write-translate (your language word) to (name of another language)
 jaise translate i love you to tamil 
 Or write, translate thank you so much to french
 duusari bhashaa main jo kuch likh kar saamne dikhaa, agar aap use istemaal karnaa chaahate hai to copy karke, jahaan chahen vahaan paste kar den
 Mogambo is happy Mogambo is happy only when he gets exactly what he wants
 agar aap bilkul vahi shabd khojna chaahate hai jo aapane likhaa he - or iske alaava kuch or nahin- to search ke liye Enter kaa batan dabaane se pehle, apane likhe shabdon ko inverted coma yani "
 
 
 
 
 
 
 "within
 isse milte julate shabd, search rigelt se hat jaaenge or google sirf aapke likhe shabdon ko khoj kar aapke saamne pesh karegaa
 For example, if you search Google by writing arvind kejriwal IIT, then you will get millions of results related to both these words 'arvind Kejriwal' and 'IIT'
 lekin agar aap inhen teen shabdon ko inverted coma ke bheetar band karke "arvind kejriwal iit" khojenge to aapako keval vahi rigelt dikhenge jinka sambandh arvind kejariwal or IIT donon se hoga
 Things like Arvind Kejriwal read from which IIT, which branch he was, when did he pass, what was the rank and Arvind Kejriwal's speech in IIT
 ye trick khaas taur par kisi gane ke bol, yaa phir sahitya kii koi mashhoor line khojane ke liye bahut kargar he
 This was the place you remember that last week you Rediff
 com par ek article padhaa tha jisamen narendra modi kii tulana sachin tendulkar se kii gayi thi
 You remember the website, but not the name of the article
 ab agar aap kisi dost ko vahi article khoj kar bhejnaa chaahate hai, to kyon na sirf rediff
 Find it at com
 search ke liye likhie narendra modi sachin tendulkar :rediff
 com
 yani, search ke liye likhe gayi shabdon ke baad, yadi aap ek spes dekar (:) ke saath website kaa naam likh denge - jaise tech it easy :aajtak
 com then Google will first search those words within the same website and present it to you
 itnaa hi nahin, yadi aap chahen to google, sirf kisi khaas tarah kii websites par hi search karegaa
 For example, if you just want to find something about telecom in Indian government websites, then write telecom: gov for search
 in agar aap civil engineering ke bare main sirf education se judi websites dekhnaa chaahate hai to search kiijie civil engineering :edu
 Get out in front of my eyes, if you want to remove any particular thing from the search, then just put a 'dash' ie dash (-)
 aapane search ke liye jo likhaa he, uske baad ek spes den, or phir (-) lagaakar aap jo bhi shabd likh dengen wo search rigelt se gaayab ho jayega
 Just like if you want to know about the Scorpio zodiac (sunshine), but thousands of results of Scorpio vehicle are bothering you, then search by writing Socrpio -SUV
 gaadi se sambandhit jyatathar rigelt gaayab ho jaaengen
 But it does not work in image search, that is, to find photos
 is (-) kaa istemaal karke aap kisi khaas website ke rigelt ko bhi filter karke hataa sakate hai
 For example, if you search by writing sachintendulkar -wikipedia, then the results of Wikipedia will be removed from the result
 isi tarah agar aap songs download -credit card likh kar khojenge to google aapako unheen websites ke bare main batayega jo credit card nahin maangate
 After knowing so many secrets, your genie will now say only one thing to you - 'jo Hukme Mere Aka'! The writer is senior reporter of 'aaj Tak'

 If there were no Veer Savarkar, the revolution of 1857 would not have made history, we would have seen it from the British point of view
 vir saavarkar ne hi san 1857 kii kranti ko pehla swatantraaa sangram kaa naam dene kaa kaam kiya
 Even today our children know him as Viplav
 'shah ke bhaashan ke is hisse ko yahaan suna ja saktaa he
 After listening to Shah's speeches, it can be understood that he was not giving credit to Savarkar for the revolution of 1857, but was giving credit to this revolution to be named 'india's first freedom struggle'
 itihaaskaar dow pravesh kumaar ne 'ajtak' ko bataaya ki amit shah ne jo baat apane bhaashan main kahi he, vah sahi he
 Veer Savarkar was the first person who described the struggle of 1857 on a large scale as India's first freedom struggle
 unhone apni kitaab 'da indian war of independence'ke jariye yah bataaya tha ki yah sangharsh keval sainikon kaa nahin tha, isamen badi sankhya main janamanas bhi shaamil the
 This book was published in 1909
 haalanki, kuch itihaaskaar yah nahin maanate ki iskaa shrey vir saavarkar ko diya janaa chahie
 Historian Saeed Irfan Habib says that there is no mention in the history of who said this first
 yah kaise kaha ja saktaa he ki vir saavarkar hi pehle vyakti the jinhone 1857 ke sangharsh ko pehla swatantraaa sangram kaa naam diya tha
 In such a situation, it is a matter of debate whether Veer Savarkar was the first person to name the Revolt of 1857 as the first freedom struggle
 haalanki padtaal main yah saaf ho jaataa he ki amit shah ke adhure bayaan kaa istemaal kar bhram failaayaa ja rahaa he

 After which three real estate agents of the police were arrested
 police ke mutabik is giroh ne navi mumbai ke bilderon se jabaran vasuuli karne ke liye puri sajeesh rachi thi
 The recovered IED was packed in a thermocol box, after the school rubbed the IED, a team joined the SIT (special Investigation Team) of the police

 Also five liters of oil was also applied
 jisamen kathith taur par chaar litre petrol hota he jo dhamaakaa hote hi aag kii lapaton kii vajah ban jaataa
 The challenge was to apprehend the accused The biggest challenge was to catch the people who had conspired to carry out the incident
 police ko un vyaktiyon or vaahan kii bhi pahchaan kerani thi, jinka istemaal arepiyon ne IED lagane ke liye kiya tha

 The accused trio has told the police that they had planned to send the message after the blast was successful and designed it in such a way that it could lead to the incident without hurting any human being
 yahaan tak ki timer bhi set 1 baje ke liye tha
 The conspirators, who were set to extort from the builders, revealed in interrogation that they had purchased ammonium nitrate powder and gelatin sticks to detonate at a controlled time at the scene
 unhone bataaya logon ko visphot se bachaane ke liye, hamane pehle chune hue sthaan ko badal diya or wo sthaan chunaa jo dukaan ke najadik thi
 The designated location was close to one of the builders' residences and would have sent forcible money of Rs 2 crore from the builder and also sent threatening messages if the blast had been successful
 lekin visphot naakaam rahaa
 Because the security guard allegedly pulled some wires as soon as IED was detected
 jisaki vajah se IED ne kaam karnaa band kar diya

 *** chennai (chennai) main aisa haadasa hua jisane har kisi ko hairaan kar diya
 Girlfriend gave bizarre challenge to boyfriend
 jisase ladkaa jail main pahunch gaya
 What did the boy want from his girlfriend
 lekin ladki ne uske saamne aisa chalange rakh diya
 Only after doing that, his wish would be fulfilled
 ladki ne bwoyfriend se burka (burqa) pahanakar chennai kii sadakon par ghoomane ko kaha
 The girl wanted her to wear a burqa and wear a burqa at Marina Beach in Royapettah, Chennai's most famous spot
 Mirror Now kii khabar ke mutabik, ladke ne chalange sweekaar kar liya or burka pahanakar chennai ke marina bich par nikal gaya
 Everything was going well
 ladkaa maje se burka pahanakar bich par gum rahaa tha
 But some people wandering there became suspicious and caused a big uproar
 logon ne dekha ki burke main koi mardon kii tarah chal rahaa he or bathroom kii chappalein pahani hai
 No one could believe that there was a woman in the burqa
 logon ko shaq hua ki burke main aayaa ye shaks yahaan galat iraade se aayaa he yaa burke main shaks chori ke iraade se aayaa he
 Many people reached him and crowds got caught and the thieves, thieves shouted at him
 log use peetane lage

 From here, bjp's Rajendra Agarwal is struggling to put a hat-trick, while BSP candidate Haji Yakub Qureshi from the BSP-SP-RLD alliance is struggling to preserve his political existence
 jabaki congress ne purv mukhyamantri babu banarsi das ke bete harendra agarwal ko utaara he
 In this way, the political battle of Meerut seems to be becoming triangular
 meerut sansadeey seat se basapa ummidavaar ke taur chunavi kismat aajamaa rahe haji yaqub kuraishi vivaadit bayaan ke liye bhi jane jate hai
 Yakub Qureshi contested the Lok Sabha elections for the first time in 1999, but he could not win
 iske baad 2002 main yaqub kuraishi basapa se vidhayak bane or vidhayak rahete hue vah 2003 main sapa main shaamil ho gaye
 Mulayam Singh Yadav made him a minister
 mantri rahete hue yaqub kuraishi ne sapa ke diggaj netaa ajam khan ke khilaaf bagwat kaa jhanda uthaa liya, jiske baad unhen party se alag hona padaa
 In 2007, Haji Yakub Qureshi entered the electoral fray by forming the UPUDF
 basapa lahar main do siton par chunaav lard rahe yaqub kuraishi ek seat par chunaav jeetne main kaamyaab hue
 Yakub Qureshi once again joined the BSP after a few days of the election results
 haalanki basapa ne 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main unhen tikat nahin diya
 After this, Qureshi fielded from Sardhana seat as RLD candidate, but he could not win
 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main haar ke baad yaqub kuraishi ne basapa kaa daaman phir tham liya or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main muradabad sansadeey seat se maidan main utre lekin is baar bhi wo jeet nahin sake
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BSP fielded him from the Meerut parliamentary seat
 meerut-hapur loksabhaa seat par kareeb 18 lakh matadaata hai, jinamein sava do lakh vaisya voter hai
 Muslims are five lakh, three and a half lakh Dalits, Thakurs 60 thousand, Brahmins one and a half lakh, Jats one lakh, Gurjars 90 thousand, Punjabi 50 thousand, backward and other four lakh voters
 is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main meerut sansadeey seat par yaqub kuraishi eklaute muslim ummidavaar hai, jo dalit, muslim or jat maton ke sahare jeet kii ummid lagaae hue hai
 At the same time, Rajendra Agarwal dreams of applying hat-trick with the support of Vaishya, Brahmin, Tyagi, Thakur and Gurjar votes
 isi tarah se congress ke harendra agarwal vaisya, ati pichhadon or muslimon maton ke sahare jeet kii ummid lagaae hue hai

 He said that JDU leaders Sharad Yadav and Lalan Singh submitted a memorandum to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh demanding action against Lalu Prasad
 bhaajapa netaa ne sawaal kiya ki nitish kumaar bataaye ki kiske dabaav main kanoon ko apana kaam nahin karne diya gaya ? susheel kumaar modi ne kaha ki sibiai kii chhapemari se sabit ho gaya he ki lalu parivaar bhrashtachar main lipt he or ab nitish kumaar ko is maamle main faisla lenaa chahie
 He demanded the dismissal of RJD President Lalu Prasad's son and Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav and Health Minister Tej Pratap Yadav from the state cabinet
 susheel modi ne kaha ki ham maang karte he ki sibiai dwaara praathmiki darj karne ke baad mukhyamantri tatkaal tejasvi yadav ko barkhaast karen
 He said that he trusts Nitish Kumar that he will take the right decision
 unhone kaha ki bihar sarkaar ne hoicourt main halafanama dekar sweekaar kiya ki patna main lalu parivaar kaa karodon rupaye kii laagat se banane vaala mal paryaavaran kanoon kaa ulanghan kar ban rahaa tha
 Its soil was sold illegally to the zoo
 bhaajapa netaa ne kaha ki lalu prasad ne jo kiya he, vahi vah bhoga rahe hai
 He said that the CBI raid has nothing to do with the RJD rally
 lalu yadav aarope lagaana chhod, tathyon kaa jawaab den
 Sushil Kumar Modi said that the debate should be on merit
 unhone rajd netaaon ko salaah di ki ve tathyon kaa jawaab den
 Today's situation is that Lalu Prasad has made the status of the largest zamindar of Bihar
 unhen bataaya chahie ki yah sab kis prakaar se hasil kiya
 He said that even during the fodder scam, Lalu Prasad was making similar statements and had to go to jail in this case during his government
 unhone sawaal kiya 'kya bhrashtachar jaise maamalon main sarkaar rajd kii raily hone tak koi karrwai nahin kare ? raily kaa bhrashtachar ke maamalon main karrwai se koi lenaa-dena nahin hota he
 Comments ullekhneey he ki rashtriya janata dal pramukh lalu prasad yadav kii beti or rajyasabha saansad misa bharti or unke pati ke dilli sthit teen farmahouson or unase sambandhit ek form par pravartan nideshaalay ne mani londring ke ek maamle kii jaanch ke tahat chaape maare
 a day earlier, the CBI had registered an FIR against Lalu Prasad and some of his family members
 is karrwai par lalu prasad apane bayaan main kah chuke hai ki vah bhaajapa kii gidad bhabhaki se darane vaale nahin hai, vah desh bachaana chahta hai
 That is why BJP wants to run away and BJP wants to drive them away
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) susheel modi ne daawa kiya ki jis maamle main sibiai kii karrwai hui he, use pehali baar nau varsh purv 12 agast 2008 ko jadyu ke tatkaaleen pradesh adhyaksh lalan singh or rashtriya pravaktaa shivanand tiwari ne ujagar kiya tha
 Senior JDU leader Sharad Yadav has raised this subject
 unhone kaha ki tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko jadyu netaa sharad yadav or lalan singh ne gyaapan saunp lalu prasad par karrwai kii maang kii thi
 The BJP leader asked that Nitish Kumar tell under whose pressure the law was not allowed to do its work? Sushil Kumar Modi said that the CBI raid has proved that the Lalu family is involved in corruption and now Nitish Kumar should take a decision in this matter
 unhone rajd adhyaksh lalu prasad ke putr evam up mukhyamantri tejasvi yadav tathaa swasthya mantri tej pratap yadav ko rajya mantrimandal se barkhaast karne kii maang kii
 Sushil Modi said that we demand that the Chief Minister immediately sack Tejashwi Yadav after the CBI registers an FIR
 unhone kaha ki unhen nitish kumaar par bharosa he ki ve sahi nirnay lenge
 He said that the Bihar government, by giving an affidavit in the High Court, accepted that the mall to be built at a cost of crores of rupees for the Lalu family in Patna was being violated by environmental law
 isaki mitti avaidh tareeke se chidyaghar ko bechi gai
 The BJP leader said that he is enjoying what Lalu Prasad has done
 unhone kaha ki sibiai ke chaape kaa rajd kii raily se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 Lalu Yadav stop accusing, answer the facts
 susheel kumaar modi ne kaha ki bahes merit par honi chahie
 He advised RJD leaders to respond to the facts
 aaj kii sthiti yah he ki lalu prasad bihar ke sabase bade jameendaar kii haisiyat bana chuke hai
 They should be told how to achieve all this
 unhone kaha ki chaara ghotaale ke samay bhi lalu prasad aisi hi bayaanbaji kar rahe the or unhen apni sarkaar ke dauraan is maamle main jail janaa padaa tha
 He asked, 'should the government not take any action in cases like corruption till the RJD rally? The rally has nothing to do with action in corruption cases
 ' tippaniyan The Enforcement Directorate conducted raids on a money laundering case against Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad Yadav's daughter and Rajya Sabha MP Misa Bharti and her husband's three farmhouses in Delhi and a firm related to them

 a arvind kejariwal dilli main phir se aam aadmi party kii sarkaar banane ja rahe hai
 Doing a clean sweep
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad se chali modi lahar ko thamte hue
 Freeing himself from the stampede of the fugitive and the picket
 to unhone ye kamaal kiya kaise-1
 Kejriwal had already put pressure on the BJP before the elections were announced
 dilli kii auto rickshaw par munh latakaae jagadish mukhi ke posters ne maahaul bana diya tha
 2
 aam aadmi party ne bijepi kii dukhati rag se haath hataaya hi nahin
 His focus remained on his chief ministerial candidates
 jab satish upaadhyaay ko project karne kii baat ai, to unke ghapale saamne le aae
 3
 aap ne dilli ke kuch tabakon se apni pakad kabhi dhili nahin kii
 Such as slums, street vendors and small businesses
 inaki sankhya kareeb 15 se 20 lakh he
 4
 dilli main aap bhrashtachar rodhi muhim sirf police or kuch anya vibhaagon kii ugaahi ko lekar hi rahi he
 In which they have been promising that if their government comes, they will get rid of the poor and small businessmen
 ye voter aap ke is vaade par bharosa bhi karte hai
 5
 kejariwal khud ko imaanadaar or peedit bataane main bhi safal rahe
 He kept apologizing the last time he resigned
 phir jab modi ne un par aaropon ke jariye waar kiya, to ve khud ko peedit bataane lage
 This made him sympathetic
 6
 The Aam Aadmi Party knew that they had a fight against the party which has a large team for media and campaign management
 aise main aap ne bhi iaiti bombai ke samarthakon kii team ko dilli chunaav se joda
 Which created such a research tool on social media in November, to find out what issues people are talking about more
 isse aap ko apane chunaav campan ko disha dene main madad mili
 7
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad jab bijepi deshbhar main chunaav lard rahi thi, tab bhi aap kii team ne puraa focus dilli par hi rakhaa
 Maintained contact with people from house to house and strengthened their base
 jabaki congress or bijepi donon udasin baithe rahe
 8
 antim samay main jab tabadatod kiran bedi ko laayaa gaya to isse bijepi main bhitari kalah shuru ho gai
 The rhetoric of some leaders has done damage to the BJP, indirectly benefiting AAP
 9
 In the last election, the Muslim vote was divided between the Congress and the AAP
 jabaki is baar vah puri tarah aap ke paksh main gaya
 Because it was assumed that the power to stop the BJP was no longer in the Congress
 10
 Just before voting, the wind almost started blowing in favor of AAP, as if Delhi now wants to see AAP completely in power
