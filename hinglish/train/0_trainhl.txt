 punjab sarkaar kii ore se maujuuda kanoon main sanshodhan karke dharmik granthon—visheshkar guru granth sahib, bhagavadgita, quran or bible—ke apmaan par umrakaid kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan laane ke vivaadaaspad faisle kii kaaphi aalochana ho rahi he
 After the approval of Chief Minister Amarinder Singh's cabinet on August 21, the Punjab Assembly on August 28 approved the inclusion of section 295AA in the Indian Penal Legislation (IPC) and the Code of Criminal Procedure (CRPC)
 yah kanoon 2016 ke kanoon ko badal detaa he jisamen keval sikh dharm granthon ke apmaan ke liye isi tarah ke dand kaa praavdhaan tha
 The bill was introduced by the erstwhile Akali dal-bjp government but was rejected by the Center in April last year
 centre kaa kahana tha ki "sabhi dharmon ko samaan rup se sammaan diya janaa chahie
 The current amendment has been criticized as "extremely strict", "dangerous" and "detrimental to minority religions"
 yah sanshodhan guru granth sahib ke "apmaan'' ko lekar 200 se zyada ghatnaon ke kaaran sikhon main baari gusse ko dekhte hue pesh kiya gaya he
 These incidents started from Bargadi village in Faridkot district, where some torn pages of the Dharma Granth were found on October 12, 2015
 is ghatana se naaraaz sikh virodh jataane ke liye sadakon par utar aae the
 Sikhs constitute about 60 percent of the total population of Punjab and they respect the Guru Granth Sahib as the living Guru
 shuru main unka virodh-pradarshan shantipurna tha, lekin 14 aktubar ko faridakot jile ke behabal kalam gaanv main police kii golibari main do pradarshnakariyon ke maare jane ke baad vah hinsak ho gaya
 The then Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal then had to remove the DGP and hand over the investigation of Bargadi to the CBI
 is baat ke dheron saboot mili hai ki bargadi or dharm granth ke apmaan kii duusari ghatnaon ko lekar sikhon main gusse ko hawa dene ke peeche pakistan kii iesai or videshon main rahane vaale ugravadi tatwon kaa haath tha
 Protests and the showing of the torn pages of the Guru Granth Sahib on social media have increased religious fanaticism among many Sikh youths in Punjab and abroad
 28 agast ko manjuur sanshodhan ko agar centre se bhi manjuuri mil jaati he to pradesh kii police ko aropiyon ko giraftaar karne or sajaa dilaane kaa atyadhik adhikaar mil jayega
 According to this amendment, "whoever damages the Sri Guru Granth Sahib, Srimad Bhagavad Gita, the Holy Quran and the Holy Bible with the intention of hurting the religious sentiments of the people, should be punished with life imprisonment
 ''iskaa aadhaar yah he ki dharmagranthon kaa apmaan kisi vishesh samudaay ke logon kii bhaawanaaon ko aahat karne ke saath kanoon-vyavastha ko bhi nuksaan pahunchaata he
 But senior law experts believe that this bill of Punjab can hardly be approved and it can be like the 2016 Bill

 In Chhattisgarh, the BSP has joined hands with Ajit Jogi, who rebelled against the Congress and formed a separate party
 vahiin, madhya pradesh main apane ummidavaaron kii list jari kar di he
 It is clear from the bsp's attitude that all hopes of an alliance with the Congress are over
 basapa ke congress sang na aane se bijepi ko ek baar phir satta ko bachaae rakhane kii aas najar aa rahi he
 At the same time, along with the election of three states, the political equation of the Congress in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is now deteriorating
 madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh main isi saal oktober-november main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 There are BJP governments in these three states
 empi or chhattisgarh kii satta main bijepi 15 saal se kabiz he
 The Congress leaders of these two states were trying for an alliance with the BSP, but Mayawati has dashed their plans
 chhattisgarh main raman singh ke netritv main bijepi teen baar se satta par kabiz he
 But there is only one percent difference between Congress and BJP
 jabaki basapa ko pichley chunaav main 4
 5 percent votes were received
 2013 ke chunaav main rajya kii 90 vidhansabha siton main se bijepi ne 49 siten jiti thim
 While Congress got 39 seats and BSP one seat
 basapa-congress ek saath milakar chunavi jang main utarate to rajya kii raajnneetik tasviir badal jane kii sambhaavna thi
 Had the BSP and Congress come together in 2013, the results would have been different
 bijepi ko 11 siton kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padataa or 38 siten milteen
 Whereas the congress-bsp alliance would have come to power with 51 seats
 yahi vajah thi ki congress ke pradesh adhyaksh lagaataar basapa ke saath milakar chunaav ladane kii baat rah the, lekin baaji congress se baghawat kar alag party banane vaale ajit jogi ke haath lagi he
 In the alliance between Mayawati and Jogi, 35 seats have come to the bsp's account and Jogi Janata Congress has won 55 seats
 jogi ke paas jahaan adivasee vot he vahiin basapa ke paas dalit matadaataaon par acchhee pakad he
 Congress leaders also believe that there are two dozen seats in the state where the BSP may suffer losses

 jabaki bijepi or congress ke bich 8
 There was a difference of 4 percent vote share
 bijepi ko 165 siten or congress ko 58 siten mili thim
 The Congress had the advantage of not contesting the bsp's by-election in Chitrakoot assembly seat

 The absence of the BSP with the Congress is considered a good sign for Shivraj
 basapa kaa congress ke saath na aana rahul gandhi ke vipakshi ekta ko jhatka mana ja rahaa he
 Due to this, the Congress may have to suffer losses in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 iske alaava aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main congress ke saath basapa rahe, ye kahana mushkil he
 If the BSP fights in a similar way in 2019, the Congress may have to suffer the loss of Dalit votes in many states
 bijepi or congress ke baad basapa eklauti party he jiskaa aadhaar rashtriya str par he
 BSP can show the same attitude in Uttar Pradesh too
 mayawati haal hi main kaha ki sammanjanak siten milengi tabhi wo mahagathbandhan kaa hissaa banegi varanaa akele chunaav ladegi
 If this happens, the Congress's attempt to unify the opposition may weaken

 While other people and her own friend did not raise their voice against this incident, despite being a woman, she became a topic of discussion with the courage of hockey player Ritu Bhoraiya

 The government of Chhattisgarh has refused to reduce VAT tax for reducing the prices of petrol and diesel

 The government argues that VAT tax is much lower in Chhattisgarh than in other states, due to which there is no scope to cut it
 rajya ke vaanijya mantri amar agarwal ne kaha ki pehle duusare rajya apana waite tex kam karen or chhattisgarh ke baraabar laaen tab wo waite kam karne ke bare main sochenge
 The state has a 4 per cent VAT tax on aviation petrol while 25 per cent on diesel and petrol

 The only concern he has is less than one percent of the people who travel by air
 rajya main ek litre petrol kii keemat 70 rupee se adhik he jabaki dijal 61 rupee prati litre ke kareeb he
 If a slight reduction in VAT tax, the price of petrol and diesel can be reduced by Rs 10 to 20 per liter

 The Hyatt Hotel's entourage gave the opposition a claim to power in the race for power of Maharashtra, the test of strength is done in the House
 aisa bahut kam hi hota he ki ek paanch sitara hotel main raajnneetik dalon ko apni takat kii numaaish kerani padati he
 But on Monday, a kind of mini assembly was decorated at Hotel Grand Hyatt in Mumbai
 shivasena-congress or ensipi ne hotel hayaat main 162 vidhayakon ko bulaayaa
 His photo session was done here and he was administered the oath of honesty and loyalty
 iske saath hi in teenon dalon ne ek baar phir elaan kar diya ki ve maharashtra kii raajnneeti main phir se front foot par aa gaye hai
 If the legal hurdles are put aside, then before the Supreme Court's decision on Tuesday, pawar-uddhav and Kharge have done very cleverly on the stinging injury that BJP does not have the strength and that of democracy The mockery is blowing
 darasal shivasena-congress or ensipi ke gathbandhan maha vikaas aghadi ne is mega event ke saath maharashtra ke liye chal rahi satta kii res main teen morchon par badhat le lee he
 The judicial fraternity has an important hearing in the Supreme Court on Tuesday in the Sandesh Maharashtra case
 maharashtra main shanivaar ko devendra fadanvis ne ek abhootpurv ghatnakram main siem pad kii shapath le lee thi
 NCP leader Ajit Pawar was sworn in as deputy CM
 maharashtra ke vipaksh ne is faisle ko supreme court main chunauti di he
 On Monday, both sides submitted their arguments before the Supreme Court
 mangalvaar ko supreme court is maamle main apana faisla sunaane vaala he
 By mobilizing around 162 mlas in his favor before this decision, Maha Vikas Aghadi has sent a message to the judicial fraternity that whatever the legal complexities may be, the justice's claim is that they are the real contenders for Maharashtra's power
 padhein: pavaar ko power mila-uddhav ko urja, 162 vidhayak saamne dekh aise garaje donon netamaharashtra kii nai raajnneetik tasvirshivsena-ensipi or congress kii is ekta ke raajnneetik myne hai
 The three parties have now openly stated that they have come together to form the government in Maharashtra
 isse pehle in teenon dalon ke bich baithkon or mantranaaon kaa hi daur chal rahaa tha
 But Fadnavis's coronation has done two things
 pehali baat to ye he ki maharashtra kii satta jaati dekh teenon hi partiyaan samjhaute ke liye taiyaar ho gai hai
 For this they are also willing to sacrifice their interests to some extent
 duusari baat ye he ki is ghatnakram ne in teenon partiyon ko apane-apane igo par bhi kaabo karne ko majaboor kar diya he
 The Congress, which was earlier hesitating to tie up with the Shiv Sena, is now fully prepared for this
 vahiin ensipi ke liye to ye ghatnakram vajood kaa hi sawaal ban gaya tha
 But on Monday, at the Hyatt Hotel, these three parties have not only managed to close their house, but have also given the message that their mlas are not going to break
 iske liye vidhayakon dwaara liya gaya shapath kaa bhi naitik dabaav he
 If this experiment is successful in Maharashtra, then this political friendship can go even further
 haalanki aisi bhavishyavaanee jaldbaaji hogi
 Let me tell you that on Monday, Pawar said that it is not with 5 years but 50 years
 uddhav thakare ne bhi aisi hi baaten dohraayigolabandi se mili naitik taqatsomvaar ko mumbai ke hayaat hotel main jo kuch hua use lakhon logon ne dekha
 People clearly saw that the leaders of the three parties have come together with the intention of forming the government and they also have a substantial majority
 teenon dalon ne daawa kiya is shakti pradarshan main uske 162 vidhayak maujuud hai
 Its message among the common people was that they have the right to form a government according to the laws and regulations of democracy, because they have the strength
 maharashtra kii maujuuda sarkaar adhar main lataki najar aati he, kyonki bahumat ke ganit main bijepi kahin se bhi sarkaar banane ke liye jaruri 145 ke aankade ke aasapaas nahin pahunchati dikh rahi he

 At the same time, Aam Aadmi Party leader Ashutosh also said, 'if Kejriwal is the' CM of the people ', then he should not separate from the public

 He said, 'no decision has been taken on security yet

 sutron kaa kahana he ki amit shah ne rajya ke saansadon ke saath hui baithak main saaf kaha ki hamen aise gathbandhan main kyon janaa chahie, jiske badale main hamen nuksaan ho
 It is clear that BJP does not want to tie up with Shiv Sena at the cost of any loss
 madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh main haar ke baad bijepi bihar main loksabhaa ke liye seat shering ke formule par pahunchi thi
 Here she is contesting 17 seats at par with JDU
 iske liye bijepi ko 2014 main jiti huin paanch siten chhodani padi thim, jisase ki uske sahyogi bhi gathbandhan main shaamil ho saken
 Although, the Lok Janshakti Party happily joined the alliance, but Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Samata Party had left the NDA
 mana ja rahaa he ki iske baad shivasena ko bhi ummid thi ki vah gathbandhan main bijepi par dabaav banaakar kuch or siten hasil kar legi
 The Shiv Sena has been taking the top leadership of the central government and the BJP under question for quite some time
 maharashtra main loksabhaa chunaavon ke chah maheene baad hi vidhansabha chunaav bhi hone hai
 Despite these things, BJP leaders feel that it will be beneficial for them to be alone in Maharashtra in the Lok Sabha elections
 mana ja rahaa he ki shivasena ke netaaon ke bayanon se bijepi ke netaaon main naaraazgi he
 BJP leaders believe that the Shiv Sena, while staying in the coalition, is constantly cutting its limits with rhetoric
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne bhi apni raily main kai baar pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf congress ke naare- chaukeedaar chor he, kaa istemaal kiya
 It is believed that Shiv Sena was expressing its displeasure and pressurizing the BJP to negotiate in the assembly elections
 bataaya jaataa he kishivsena288 siton vaali vidhansabha main barabari kii hissedari chaahati he
 But when BJP has 123 mlas, it does not seem possible to give half to the Shiv Sena i
e
 144 seats
 bihar main seat shering dekhne ke baad shivasena ko ummid thi ki bijepi maharashtra main bhi gathbandhan ke liye naram rukh apnayegi
 But seeing the attitude of the BJP, it seems that there will be no alliance between the BJP and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra or even if there will be a lot of struggle for this

 Sources are quoting that Advani was now in favor of handing over the command of the campaign committee to Nitin Gadkari in place of Narendra Modi, but Nitin Gadkari refused to hold the post
 gadakari ne kaha ki party ne pehle hi iske liye modi kaa naam tay kar diya he
 In political circles, this whole issue is being seen as a growing distance between Advani and Modi
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki is mudde par adwani ne gadakari se kai baar mulaakaat kii
 He told Gadkari that he was misled by a party leader to remove him from the post of president
 tippaniyan Significantly, Advani played a big role in removing him from the post of president after the raid on Gadkari's companies, although according to sources, Advani could not succeed in persuading Gadkari
 gadakari ne saaf kar diya ki jab pehle hi is pad ke liye modi kaa naam lagbhag tay ho chukaa he to unke naam ko aage badhanaa thik nahin hoga
 Actually, this is not the only example of a large gap between Modi and Advani

 Gadkari made it clear that when Modi's name has already been decided for this post, it would not be right to pursue his name
 darasal, modi or adwani ke bich badi hoti khai kii yah iklauti misaal nahin he
 Last week, Advani's statement also confirmed the growing distance in which he had said that Shivraj was better than Modi
 naubat yah aa gai thi ki rajnath singh ko saamne aakar yaad dilaanaa padaa ki modi bade netaa hai
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan himself also accepted this

 dilli ke rajendra place metro stesan main somvaar ko hui lut kii vaardaat ko anjaam dene vaale badmaash abhi tak police kii pahunch se baahar hai
 This loot has once again put a question mark over the security of Metro stations in Delhi
 is cese main police ke haath abhi tak khaali hai
 Questions on security: Despite the security arrangements from around the world on Monday morning, two crooks entered Delhi with Rajendra Placemetro station
 badmaash bekhauf hokar stesan ke control room main ghuse or metro kaa 12 lakh kaa collection lootakar faraar ho gaye
 After this incident, questions were raised on the security arrangements of Delhi Metro Administration and CISF
 sisitivi camere bhi naakamadilli ke rajendra place metro stesan par din-raat behad bheed bhaad rahati he
 a major incident of loot at the metro station near Karol Bagh area on Monday morning morning made the CISF and police conscious
 stesan kii sisitivi footage main donon badmaashon ko dekha ja saktaa he lekin unke chehre nahin
 Both miscreants carried out the loot in a very vicious manner
 donon badmaash mask lagaakar stesan main ghuse taaki sisitivi footage main unke chehre na kaid hon
 At 5
15 am on Monday morning, both miscreants entered inside gate number 2 in the metro station
 19 minute main puri vaardaatdonon platform number 2 par maujuud control room main jabaran shikaayat darj karaane ke bahaane ghus gaye
 And stabbed a worker named Kunal Kishore who was present there and looted around Rs 12 lakh
 report ke mutabik, lut kii ghatana minuton main puri hui
 19 minutes later, at 5
34 am, the miscreant escaped from gate number one and escaped
 kuch ahm sawalsuraksha agenciyon ko shaq he ki jis tareeke se luteron ne bade aaraam se ghatana ko anjaam diya, use dekhakar lagata he ki unhen metro staff ke collection ke bare main puri jaankaree thi
 The important questions that have arisen in the police investigation are that 01
 uske mutabik, badmaashon ne metro staff ko chaaku maaraa to uski chillane kii aawaaj kisi ne kyon nahin suni?02
 At the time of admission in the station, how did the sharp weapon get clearance in security check of bags etc
 03
 lut main istemaal kiya gaya dhardaar hathiyaar metro stesan par maujuud kisi staffr ne to muhaiyaa nahin karaayaa
 Looking for the accused miscreants absconding is a big challenge for the police who are engaged in the police vacancy
 unke chehre saaf na hone kii vajah se police kii jaanch puri nahin ho paa rahi he
 Neither the miscreants have been identified nor any clue has been found by the police
 ab badmaashon kii giraftaar ke baad hi saaf hoga ki aakhir metro stesan par hui lut kii sajeesh ke taar kahaan tak faile hai

 Other major political parties including BJP, Congress and DMK have not given details of the amount of donations raised during the Lok Sabha elections within the stipulated time frame
 ayog ke sutron ne mangalvaar ko kisi pramukh dal kii ore se is bare main byora nahin milane kii pushti kii he
 According to the Supreme Court's instructions, by May 30, all political parties had to give details of the donations raised from the electoral bonds to the Election Commission
 baharhaal, congress ne kaha ki uske netaa motilal vora ne 30 may ko bhartiya state bank (esbiai) or nirvachan ayog (isi) ko patr likhakar bank se ucchtam nyaayalay ke aadesh kaa paalan karne or chunaav ayog ko silband lipaphe main soochna dene ke liye kaha tha kyonki party ko bhi nahin maaloom ki kisne ye bond kharide
 The Congress said it had asked the bank to inform the EC
 ayog ne may main yah samay seemaa khatm hone se pehle sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko chunavi bond se jutaye gayi chande kaa byoraa dene kii likhit taur par taakid kii thi
 a commission official said that the major political parties BJP, Congress and DMK have not given details "at least" yet
 ullekhneey he ki 12 april ko ucchtam nyaayalay ne raajnneetik dalon ko nirdesh diya tha ki ve sarkaar kii raajnneetik daan yojana main mili chande ke daataaon kii suchi silband lipaphe main ayog ko 30 may tak saunp den
 There is a contradiction between the Commission and the government about making the identity of donors public in the scheme
 ek taraf sarkaar daandaataaon kii pahchaan gupt rakhane kii pakshdhar he, vahiin ayog ne chunavi chande main paardarshita kaa hawala dete huye daandaataaon kii pahchaan saarvajanik karne kii paraakaari kii he
 In this regard, the Commission had said before the court that its approach is limited to transparency of political donations, it has nothing to do with the merits and demerits of the scheme
 is yojana ke tahat koi bhi bhartiya naagarik yaa bharat main sthapit evam sanchalit nikaay kisi raajnneetik dal ko bank se chunavi bond kharid kar chanda de saktaa he
 Any political party registered under Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act can receive donations from electoral bonds which have got at least one percent vote in the Lok Sabha or Assembly elections
 yojana ke tahat bhartiya state bank kii desh kii 29 shakhaon ko pichley saal ek se das november ke bich chunavi bond jari karne ke liye adhikrut kiya gaya tha

 Shweta Singh asked that after 5 years in power, do you understand what is the best approach for Jammu and Kashmir? Answering this question, PM Modi said, "A handful of families have chosen a way to blackmail Jammu and Kashmir emotionally
" mufti sahab the, tab hamen aashaa thi ki ham isse baahar aaenge, lekin vah hamaari mahamilawat thi

 Sakshi Maharaj said that no one can stop the grand Ram temple from being built
 sawaal- sakshi ji, ek baar phir mandir mudda garmaya chunaav se pehle aapako kya lagata he mandir ban paaegaa?sakshi maharaj- yah media kii dein he ki chunaav se pehle mandir mudda garma gaya he 
 Prabhu Ram is the emperor of the hearts of many Hindus, ideal
 is desh kii pahchaan he
 But we are committed to the fact that the Ram temple will be built and we have given the slogan Ram Lala we will come, build the temple there itself
 jabaki mulaayam singh ne kaha tha ki parinda bhi par nahin maar saktaa
 But we built a small temple
 mandir banaaya gaya
 Now we can say that Ram Lala Hum Aayega will build a grand and divine temple
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ji ne to jai shriram kaa udghosh kar hi diya he
 Unfortunately people are saying that Modi ji did not go to Ayodhya
 kyon nahin gaye, lakhanu tak gaye, aadhe raste tak gayi or jai shri ram bol diya
 He started deriving its meaning for politics
 kya kya arth nikaalane shuru kar die
 When Ramlila happens, Sonia goes to Manmohan Singh
 sab log jate hai
 It has no meaning sawaal- sakshi ji vinay katiyaar ji kah rahe hai jo centre sarkaar ramayana museum bana rahi he samaajawaadee party bhi vahaan ramlila park banane ja rahi he
 Is it a lollipop somewhere or should a Ram temple be built? Sakshi Maharaj - New music is also a part of that
 bhagwaan ram abhi tripal main hai
 He will be given a grand divinity
 yah bhi to usee kaa ek bhaag he
 The temple is a part of construction
 ham is kaa swaagat karte hai
 My heart goes out to Mahesh Sharma ji
 sawaal- mandir kab banegaa sakshi ji?sakshi maharaj mandir to ban hi gaya he bhavyata divyata pradaan kerani he uske teen raste hai jo teen raste hai usamen se koi rasta nikalegaa or bhavy mandir ban jayega
 Question- Sakshi ji, when will the grand divine temple be built by the people of your party, it will be built before 2017? Sakshi Maharaj can be built even before 2017
 sawaal- sakshi ji chunaav main kya mudda rahegaa, kitna dominete karegaa, kitna haaavee rahegaa yah mudda?sakshi maharaj- hamaare paas to vikaas kii hajaaron mudde he
 Every issue Modi ji has left like this
 jis par chunaav ladaa ja saktaa he
 Ram cannot be denied
 ram hamaare adarsh hai
 Ram is our life
 agar ram nikal jaaenge to ram naam sat ho jaaegi
 Therefore nothing can happen without Ram's name
 ram ke bina chunaav nahin ho sakate

 ’’ If you go to a hospital or clinic, you must have seen the MRI machine
 lekin mubani main is mashin ne aisa kuch kiya ki do jindagiyaan khatre main pad gayi
 It happened that two employees in the treatment and research center of Tata Memorial Hospital in Khargar, Navi Mumbai, got into the machine's mouth
 darasal ek karmchaaree ward boy sunil jadhav apane saath ek oxigen silinder laayaa tha or vah sidhe us kamare main chalaa gaya jahaan emarai mashin rakhi hui thi
 The second employee, Swami Ramaiya who was a technician, was standing near the machine
 jaise hi jadhav vahaan pahunchaa mashin se paidaa hue magnetic field ne use silinder ke saath apni ore khinch liya
 The magnetic strength of the machine was so high that Jadhav went straight towards it with a cylinder flying in the air
 ramaiya jo mashin ke paas khadaa tha silinder or jadhav ke bich dab gaya
 The machine was continuously pulling it towards him
 donon kii cheekh pukaar ke baad kai karmchaaree vahaan pahunche or unhen baahar nikaalane kaa ytn karne lage lekin kisi ko safalataa nahin mili
 On the other hand, due to the tremendous pressure of the cylinder, his bones started breaking and the internal organs started getting damaged
 karmchaariyon ne haalanki mashin kii bijli band kar di lekin uskaa magnetic field barkaraar rahaa or vah un donon tathaa oxigen silinder ko apni ore khinchataa rahaa
 Both kept screaming in pain but there was no way out
 phir donon behosh ho gaye
 This news was given by a Mumbai newspaper
 lagbhag chaar ghante ke baad mashin banane vaali company kaa ek technician vahaan pahunchaa or usne use niskriy kiya
 After this, both were taken to Bombay Hospital
 vahaan doctoron ne bataaya ki swami kaa pet or upree jaanghen tut gai hai
 His bladder has also been damaged
 uski kidney par bhi asar padaa he
 Jadhav has a broken arm and is also injured
 swami kii haalat gambhir he or use kai doctor dekh rahe hai
 He has become numb due to reduced blood flow to his lower back
 uske andar kii nason se rakt pravaah nahin ho paa rahaa he
 Actually all this is due to Jadhav's senselessness
 use ek doctor ne oxigen mask laane ko kaha tha kyonki ek cancer ke marij kaa check ap hona tha
 But Jadhav brought oxygen cylinders
 emarai room main kabhi bhi kisi tarah ke dhaatu ke saamaan laane kii ijaajat nahin hoti he kyonki vahaan magnetic field bana hota he
 The oxygen cylinder is made of iron and the machine tried to swallow it as soon as it came in and both the employees got trapped in it
 donon kii jaan khatre main pad gai
 Such incidents are rare but now Swami's life is in danger and will be treated long

 helo master ke naam se mashhoor ram kumaar mandal thagi ke maamle main itnaa maahir he ki apane mobile phone se kisi ko bhi kol lagaakar pehle uskaa bharosa jeetta or phir uske bank acount par haath saaf kar detaa
 In this way, he has spent crores so far
 anand vihaar ke ek shaks ne is silsile mempulice se shikaayatki thi
 He had said that on May 13, a man told the victim on the phone that he was speaking to the Reserve Bank
 or uske account ke veriphication ke liye use kuch detail kii zarurat he
 After that, the person took all the information about his account from the victim

 lekin akhirkaar police kaamyaab ho gai
 By the way, police of 25 states were engaged in search of this thugs master of Jamtara
 lekin ramkumar mandal dilli police ke hathe chadh gaya

 aise main ab dilli police sade libaas main jamtada pahunchi
 He did not even contact the local police and then the policemen got divided in different parts before reaching the village, some reached the village by auto and many buses so that no one got suspicious and then all reached the village together
 And straight away reached Ramkumar's house and caught him
 talaashi main uske ghar ke andar kareeb paanch lakh cash mila jo ki diaper ke bag main chipa kar rakhaa tha
 If Ram Kumar's villagers believed, Ram Kumar's boys did not spare Amitabh Bachchan, and took 5 lakh pieces from him as a bank manager, even though the Delhi Police says that they are not aware of it
 ab tak police ko ram kumaar ke sirf ek account kii jaankaree mil saki he, jisamen kuch dinon main ek karod rupee aae hai
 Police say that the total number of accounts that Ram Kumar has with him is being ascertained
 saath hi police ko ummid he ki is master kii giraftaar ke baad aanaline thagi main kuch kami aegi

 The Election Commission counsel opposed the contention that the purpose of reservation was to give fair representation to scheduled caste candidates

 In such a big accident, from the officer to the people of the area are telling the negligence of the factory owner
 factory me kaam karanevaale logon ke mutabik dhamaakaa itnaa tej tha ki aasapaas ke gharon main daraaren tak aa gai
 a heavy force has been deployed on the spot
 haadase ke baad se mritak ke parijanon ne factory get par jam lagaakar apane gusse kaa izhaar kiya
 Seeing the matter growing, top officials reached the spot and assured the family to investigate
 iske baad parijanon kaa gussa shant hua
 The entire matter has been discussed throughout the country, including Bollywood, after Bollywood's senior Acternana Patekar was accused of molestation and molestation during the shooting
 haalanki bollywood main chuppi he
 Meanwhile, a journalist has said that there is truth in what Tanushree is saying
 patrkaar kaa daawa he ki 10 saal pehle ghatana ke dauraan vah bhi maujuud thim
 tanushree-nana controversy: Actor said on the charges- Legal action Karungapatrakar's name is Janis Cikeria
 unhone kai twits main kahani bataaya he
 He wrote, "many times the events of a decade ago are still fresh in your mind
 film horn oke plis kii shooting ke dauraan hui ek ghatana bhi kuch aisi hi he
 "janice wrote," i was there at the time, Nana Patekar
 mujhe bataaya gaya ki actress kii vajah se shooting roki gai he
 Tanushree became difficult to handle
 main safataur par dekh paa rahi thi ki tanushri kisi baat se bahut apaset thim
 "tanushree confesses to have cosmetic surgery, received such advice
 The plan was changed on the last occasion? Janis wrote that she was able to see clearly that Nana Patekar, choreographer Ganesh Acharya and a person (which she later came to know
 That the producer of the film) was discussing something standing there and about 50 dancers were waiting on the set
 aadhikarik jaankaree yah thi ki heroin sahyog nahin kar rahi he
 After some time shooting started
 Metoo par tanushri- actor karnaa chahta tha intimet seen, gusse main tod di thi karjainis ne apane twit main likhaa - "tanushri ne apana kaam phir shuru kar diya or kuch shots ke baad naanaa ne phir se unhen join kar liya
 But Tanushree left the set as soon as Nanane came
 shooting phir se roak di gai
 He locked himself in a vanity van
 vah baahar aane se inkaar kar rahi thim
 In view of it, a few mustaches were gathered there and they started pushing the door
 "tanushri ke maa-baap par hua hamalaa?jaankaree lene par pataa chalaa ki in logon ko produsar ne hi bulaayaa tha
 Meanwhile the police came
 in sabake bich jainis ko naanaa se baat karne kaa mauka mil gaya or naanaa ne sirf itnaa kaha, "meri beti jaisi he
 "there was no meaning on that occasion
 jainis ne bataaya ki isi bich tanushri ke mata-pita vahaan aae or unki car par hamalaa kar diya gaya
 The car's wind shield was broken
 tanushri-naanaa vivaad: big bi ne tarakaaya sawaal, aamir bole- 'jaanch ho'ro padi thim tanushri datta?baad main kisi tarah jab jainis ko tanushri se milane kaa mauka mila to unhone rote-rote puri dastaan unhen sunai
 According to Janis, Tanushree told him that after 3 days of practice, choreographer Ganesh Acharya had changed every step of the dance shoot
 yah sab isliye kiya gaya kyonki produsar chaahate the datta ke saath naanaa dance karen
 In this shoot, Tanushree has mentioned Nana's infatuation
 ye hai taimur ali khan kii naini, jaane kitni milti he selary?kya bole film ke nirdeshak?is bich tanushri ke bayaan par maamla badhane ke baad film "horn oke plis" ke nirdeshak rakesh saarang ne mid-de se ek baatcheet main kaha, "tanushrikah rahi hai ki nathni utaaro ek solo dance song tha, jiske liye unhone reharsal kii thi
 So they must have also heard this song during preparation
 unhen yah kaise nahin yaad he ki gane main ek mail wois bhi thi
 It was always a duet song
 "nirdeshak ne kaha, "lagata he ki datta ko galatfahami ho rahi he
 See, if your boss wants to flirt with you, he will not do this work publicly, he will call you in a cabin
 vahaan par takreeban 400 log maujuud the

 According to sources, the party wants to bring Vasundhara as the chief ministerial candidate and there is no difference of opinion
 vasundhara kii istife kii dhamkee ke baad rajasthan bijepi kii andruni kalah khulkar saamne aa gai he
 But at the party's press conference in Delhi, it was said that the issue of Rajasthan is an internal matter of the party
 bijepi jis maamle ko andruni qaraar dekar pardedaari kii koshish kar rahi he vah darasal rajasthan main aresas or bijepi ke bich kii rassakashi he
 Gulab Chand Kataria may have withdrawn his proposed visit, but this tug-of-war between Kataria and Vasundhara will continue to haunt the BJP
 shanivaar ko party kii kor cameti kii baithak main vasundhara ne istife kii chetavanee dete hue baithak bich main hi chhod di thi
 After this, although Kataria postponed his proposed visit, Vasundhara and his supporters did not agree to this and then his supporters started resigning to pressurize the central leadership
 in vidhayakon ne apane istife haalanki vidhansabha adhyaksh ko na saunpkar vasundhara ko saunpe hai
 After the news of resignation, there was a stir in the party from Jaipur to Delhi
 sutron ke mutabik iske baad adhyaksh nitin gadakari or arun jetali ne khud vasundhara se phone par baatcheet kii or maamle ko sulajhane kaa prayaas kiya
 a senior party leader said on condition of anonymity, "40 mlas including Kalicharan Saraf, Digamber Singh, Gyan Dev Ahuja, Rohitashv Sharma, Ashok Parnami and Mohanlal Gupta submitted their resignations to Raje by noon
 in vidhayakon ne vasundhara ke saath jaipur main kai baithken kii

 Input: IANS dhaulpur pales ke malikana haq ko lekar rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ek baar phir vivaadon main hai
 Know all about the history and geography of this palace: 1
 dhaulpur kaa mahal yani raaj nivas palacevasundhara raaje ke sasur raja udaybhanu singh ne banwaaya tha
 Vasundhara's husband Raja Hemant Singh was adopted by his maternal grandfather Udayabhanu Singh, i
e
 he was his adopted son
 dhaulpur nagar parishad or tehsil karyaalay ke dastavejon ke mutabik khasra number 875 main rajmahal or uske chaaron ore kii jameen kaa rakabaa 45 bigha ek biswa he
 After becoming the Chief Minister of Rajasthan for the first time in 2003, Vasundhara extended the boundary wall of his palace by fifty meters
 sabase dilachasp baat ye ki adalati dastavejon ke mutabik sampatti ke adhikaar ko lekar vasundhara or unke bete dushyant kaa mukadmaa raja hemanth singh ke saath chal rahaa tha
 Its decision came on 19 May 2007
 yani sampatti kaa setlement may 2007 main hua
 But according to the documents of the city council, the property was transferred to Dushyant on 11 June 2004
 ab is baat kaa jawaab nagar parishad ke paas nahin he ki teen saal baad kii chijen nagar parishad adhyaksh ne 2004 main hi kaise tad leen
 2
 mahal lagbhag ek bighas main bana he
 It has more than fifty rooms
 do angan hai
 The very next year after becoming the Chief Minister, in 2004, Vasundhara renovated the old palace and made it a heritage hotel
 tab paryaton vibhaag ne saadhe teen karod rupee aitihaasik viraasaton kii saaj sambhaal ke liye aavantit kiye the
 Another palace was built with that amount
 usamen hi vasundhara raaje jab dhaulpur aati hai to rahati hai
 3
 mahal ke aasapaas kii 45 bigha jameen sarkari dastavejon main gairaabadi vaale ilaake ke rup main darj he
 That is, farming land
 lekin neshnal hive par jab fliover ban rahaa tha to vasundhara ne dawaab daalkar haive kaa allinement thodaa badalawakar apane rajmahal kii charadivari ke paas se gujaravaya
 After this, about two crore rupees of agricultural land was recovered at commercial rate
 4
 The government was its own, so Vasundhara made arrangements to make the agricultural land around the palace also commercially profitable
 darasal rajmahal kii charadivari se sate teen aitihaasik park - gandhi park, nehru park or subhash park the
 Vasundhara met the city council and got the three parks united
 apni charadivari se sate park ko 25 foot aage khiskaa diya
 Removed the main road so that a vacant land of the palace would be built on a vacant land, by building a mall, commercial complex or other commercial building to pay its monthly rent of crores of rupees
 5
 The Chief Minister of Rajasthan, Vasundhara Raje is called Maharani of the former princely state of Dholpur
 unke paas na to kisi tarah kii bhoomi he, na hi koi makaan yaa anya jaaydaad
 At the time of the last assembly elections, Vasundhara Raje was the owner of 20 bighas of agricultural land in Dholpur, but this time she did not even own this land
 beete vidhansabha chunaavon ke namakan ke saath prastut kiye gaye sampatti ke vivaran main unhone yah jaankaree di he
 She is the owner of a total assets of 30 million 96 million 28 thousand
 inamen do karod 37 hajaar rupye ke share, band or dibenture hai, jabaki 26 lakh 62 hajaar 190 rupye vasundhara raaje ke naam bank or anya vittiya sansthaaon main jamaa hai
 He has other assets worth 55 lakh 50 thousand which have not been disclosed
 saath hi, unke paas 38 lakh 55 hajaar 300 rupye keemat kaa sona he
 In cash, he has six and a half thousand rupees
 in paanch saalon main vasundhara raaje kii sampatti main ek karod 19 lakh kaa ijapha hua he
 By the way, if seen as an achievement, Vasundhara Raje has definitely become debt-free in these five years
 6
 On May 7, 2007, in the district court of Dholpur, the Raj family has been settled in a lawsuit for years
 iske anusaar, mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje dhaulpur kii purv maharani bani rahengi
 Her husband 'former Maharaja' Hemant Singh would have no objection to her being called 'former Empress'
 yah shart us sulah kaa hissaa he jo hemanth singh or unke saansad putr dushyant singh ke bich 7 may 2007 ko bharatpur kii ek adaalat main hui
 After this reconciliation of father and son produced in court, the property dispute which has been going on for the last 29 years in the Dholpur royalty was settled
 samjhaute ke mutabik, dilli sthit sabhi sampatti hemanth singh rakhenge, jabaki dhaulpur va anya sthanon kii sabhi sampattiyon par dushyant singh kaa haq hoga
 7
 gauratlab he ki gwalior gharaane kii tatkaaleen rajmata swargeey vijay raaje sindhiya ne 1978 main apane naaballig navaase dushyant singh kii ore se dhaulpur kii adaalat main sampatti ke bantwaare kaa daawa pesh kiya tha
 The special thing is that in this case, statements were recorded on September 11, 2005, while Vasundhara Raje was also the Chief Minister
 adaalat kii ore se niyukt kamishnar ke saamne dilli main apane putr dushyant singh ke paksh main die bayaan main vasundhara raaje ne kaha tha ki hindu uttaradhikaar adhinium ke tahat dhaulpur rajgaraane kii sampatti kaa swaamitv dushyant singh kaa he
 The royal palace of Dholpur will now be owned by MP Dushyant Singh on 'city Palace', Bawargam Palace and movable and immovable property in Agra, Shimla, Banaras and other places
 inamen maujuud heere-jawaharaat va duusare keemtee shahi saamaan par bhi unka hi haq hoga
 a major similarity between the Delhi-based Union Public Service Commission building, Dholpur House (UPSC) and Rajnivas Palace in Dhaulpur, is that the former owners are the same
 ye donon hi bhawan kabhi raja hemanth singh kii sampattiyaan hua karti thim, jo ki rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke purv pati va saansad dushyant singh ke pita hai
 8
 haal hi main lalit modi prakaran ke chalate dhaulpur sthit jo rajanivas pales hotel vivaad main aayaa he, yah kabhi unki sampatti hua karti thi
 Having acquired the status of a heritage hotel, the hotel has shares of Dushyant Singh, his wife Niharika, mother Vasundhara Raje and family friend Lalit Modi
 yah hotel us niyant heritage hotel kii sampatti he jiske 10 rupye ke share ko lalit modi ne 96,180 rupye kii dar se kharida tha
 The history of this hotel is quite interesting
 jis dhaulpur main yah sthit he vah ilaaka bhi paariwarik vivaadon kaa shikaar rahaa
 History records that Babur, the founder of the Mughal state in the medieval period, found this place quite delightful
 baad ke bhi mughal badshaah is par nisaar rahe
 Jahangir was requested by his crown prince Shah Jahan to hand it over
 use laga ki darkhaast manjuur ho hi jaaegi isliye sweekruti milane ke pehle hi usne apane afasaron ko vahaan bhej diya
 But Jahangir's beloved Begum Malika Nur Jahan also loved this place
 vah bhi is bare main badshaah se apni ichha prakat kar chuki thi
 She wanted this place for Shahzada Shaharyar
 usne sharif ul malik ko vahaan kaa prashaasak banaakar bhej diya
 There was a bloody struggle between the two groups over the occupation of Dholpur and nine people were killed
 isse badshaah jahangir bahut naaraaz hua va usne yuvaraj ko vahaan se bahut dur bhej diya
 This palace remained in the discussion even during the Peshwa and Marathas
 9
 Udayabhan was the last king of this palace made of red stone

 There is a doubt about whether the National Lok Samata Party (RLSP) will stay with the NDA or will join the Grand Alliance in next year's Lok Sabha elections
 araspi supremeo or kendriya mantri upendra kushvaha ne kai baar ishaaron-ishaaron main is baat ke sanket de chuke hai ki agar endie main unki party ko sammanjanak seat nahin di jaati to vah mahagathbandhan main ja sakate hai
 In Bihar, talks have been going on between the BJP and its allies over the past few days on the coordination of the seats
 zyada se zyada seat hathiyaane ko lekar sabase zyada rassakashi bhartiya janata party (bijepi) aurajanata dal united(jadyu) ke bich dekhi ja sakati he
 Many formulas are also coming out regarding the resentment of the seats by the possible formula, one of which is that the BJP contested elections in 20 out of 40 seats and in the remaining 20 seats 12 JDU, 6 seats LJP and 2 seats RLSP
 Be given to
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne rashtriya lok samta party ko 3 siten di thi or teenon par hi uski jeet hui thi magar is baar 2 siton kii baat saamne aa rahi he jisko lekar upendra kushvaha kaaphi naaraaz hai
 In order to pressurize the BJP, Upendra Kushwaha organized a program called paigam-e-kheer on Tuesday in Patna
 kehane ke liye to is kaarykram kaa makasad samaaj main samarasata badhaane kaa sandesh dena tha lekin iskaa asli makasad bijepi ko sandesh dena tha ki araspi ko sammanjanak siten nahin milti he to vah koi or faisla le sakate hai
 At the paigam-e-kheer program, Upendra Kushwaha himself made kheer and fed his party workers
 'kheer' main kai logon kaa yogadanajtak se khaas baatcheet karte hue upendra kushvaha ne kaha ki unke is kaarykram main jo kheer bani he, uske liye doodh yaduwanshiyon ne di he, chaaval kushvaha jati, chini brahman samaaj, panchmeva ati pichhadaa jati ke logon ne diya or ise pavitra karne ke liye tulsi daliton ke ghar se aayaa he
 On top of all this, Kushwaha said that the Dastarkhan Muslim society gave to eat kheer
 is kaarykram ke jariye ishaaron hi ishaaron main bijepi par hamalaa karte hue upendra kushvaha ne kaha ki unke is kaarykram kaa mukhya makasad he ki kisi ko bhi kheer na zyada mili or na kam yani ki jiskaa jitna haq he use utana milanaa chahie
 Upendra Kushwaha's party RLSP has on several occasions claimed that it has a 10% vote bank in Bihar, which has Kushwaha, Koiri and Dhanuk Samaj, while Nitish Kumar's party JDU has only 2% Kurmi
 The society is the vote bank
 party bijepi ko yah sandesh dena chaahati he ki zyada vot bank hone kii vajah se araspi ko jadyu se adhik siten milani chahie
 It is important to mention here that while addressing a program a month ago, Upendra Kushwaha had said that if milk of Yaduvanshi and rice of Kushwaha community is available, then it can be a good kheer
 kushvaha ke is bayaan kaa saaf matlab tha ki agar bijepi unhen sammanjanak seat nahin de sakati he to vah argedy ke saath gathbandhan kar mahagathbandhan main shaamil ho sakate hai
 This statement of Upendra Kushwaha was also supported by RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav and invited him to join the grand alliance
 haalanki, kushvaha ne uske agle din hi phir se you-turn liya or kaha ki unke bayaan kaa aisa koi matlab nahin tha or vah endie main bane rahenge

 But as soon as dawn, there was happiness on my face, so that i do not look like a loser in front of my children

 "today is my day! Wish you all a happy # worldcancerday and hope each one of us celebrates this day in an embracing way
 That we remove any stigma or taboo associated with it
 That we spread awareness about it and that we have self love no matter what
 i truly embrace all my scars as they are my badges of honour
 There is nothing known as perfect
 Happiness lies in truly accepting yourself
 This was a tough one for me
 But this picture was my decision as i want to celebrate not the disease but the spirit with which i endured

 karnataka main chal rahi siyaasi rassakashi kaa asar manipur or nagaland jaise purvottar ke do rajyon main bhi mahasoos kiya jane laga he
 On Friday, former Manipur Chief Minister and now Leader of Opposition Okram Ibobi Singh met the state governor Jagdish Mukhi
 ibobi singh ne rajyapal ko chitthee dekar manipur main bijepi ke netritv vaali sarkaar ko barkhaast karne kii maang kii
 The letter states that last year, the bjp-led government was sworn in illegally
 ibobi singh ne rajyapal ko di chitthee main likhaa he ki manipur main congress ko sabase badi party hone ke naate sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa diya janaa chahie
 The Congress was the single largest party with 28 mlas in the elections to the 11th Assembly of Manipur
 jabaki bijepi 21 vidhayakon ke saath duusare number kii party thi
 The letter claimed that the Hon'ble Governor, without exercising discretion, invited the BJP to form the government which had formed post-poll alliances with other parties like NPP, NPF etc
 manipur main sabase badi party congressbta den ki 60 sadasyeey manipur vidhansabha main bahumat kaa aankada 31 tha or isse bijepi 21 seat ke saath 10 seat dur thi
 The BJP then managed to win a majority by mustering the support of the Naga People's Front (4), the National People's Party (4) and the Lok Janshakti Party (1) and 1 Independent
 isse pehle rajyapal najma hepatulla ne bijepi ke en biren singh ko sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa diya tha
 The Governor then rejected the argument of Congress being the largest party to get a chance to form the government
 ibobi singh ne karnataka ke rajyapal vajubhai vaala kii ore bijepi ke yediurppa ko sabase badi party ke netaa hone ke naate sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa dene kaa hawala diya
 Ibobi Singh has written in the letter that after the fractured mandate in the recent assembly elections in Karnataka, the Governor invited the BJP which emerged as the largest party to form the government even though it did not have a majority figure
 vahaan congress or jedies ke chunaav baad hue gathbandhan ke paas bahumat kaa aankada tha
 It has also been said in the letter that while inviting governors to form the government in all states, the same principle should be followed
 manipur main hue ek or gadabadi kii ore dhyaan dilaate hue ibobi singh ne kaha ki vahaan bijepi sarkaar pichhali vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal puraa hone se pehle hi gathit kar di gai thi jo ki samvidhan or kanoon kaa puraa ulanghan he
 The Congress claimed that while Manipur had a fractured mandate but the Congress had won 28 seats, which was just 3 seats away, it was clear that the mandate of Manipur was with the Congress
 ibobi singh ne chitthee main rajyapal ko ye bhi likhaa he- ‘main aapako aashwast karata hum ki jitna vakt bhi aap denge, usamen ham sadan main apana bahumat sabit kar denge jo manipur ke logon ke hit main hoga
 Meanwhile, a similar demand in Nagaland has been raised by former Chief Minister and Naga People's Front (NPF) leader TR Zeliang
 jeliang ne twit main likhaa he ki ve rajyapal ke saamne nagaland main sarkaar banane ke liye daawa karenge
 The NPF has 26 members in the 60-member Nagaland Legislative Assembly
 jeliang kaa kahana he ki alag alag rajya main alag alag maapdand kyon apanaae ja rahe hai
 Zeliang has also questioned why the NPF was not invited as the single largest party and why it was not given 15 days to prove its majority
 nagaland ke purv mukhyamantri jeliang ne daawa kiya he ki karnataka ke haalia ghatnakram or use lekar bihar, goa or manipur se sabase badi partiyon kii ore se uthaae gaye taarkik sawaalon se ye sahi vakt he ki rajyon main rajbhawanon kii eemaandaaree par vichaar kiya jaae
 In Nagaland, the 18-seat Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party formed the government with the support of 12 BJP and one JDU and one independent MLA

 The comments buudhvaar ko 'big bos' ke ghar main din kii shuruyaat 'golmaal he bhai sab golmaal he' geet ke saath hui
 At the beginning of the day, Nitibha, Manveer and Mona were seen talking
 is bich kisi baat par manavir ne mona ko ek din pehle hue jackuji vaale task par taana maaraa jo mona ko acha nahin laga
 Priyanka and Manu, sitting in the secret room of the house, were seen talking to the Indian people inside the house about the deteriorating relationship and behavior in return for Manveer
 manu ne priyanka ko kaha ki ab baahar se dekhne ke baad mujhe celebrities se koi samasya nahin he
 i will be with him as soon as i go home

 Mona also cried
 vahiin gaurav bani ko dhundte dikhe jo unase kaaphi naaraaz thim
 Suddenly the alarm rang in the house and everyone was shocked and later learned that Swami Om was found sleeping in a toilet inside the toilet inside the jail
 ghar main bibi loktantr task duusare din bhi shuru rahaa jisamen big bos ne poocha ki kya rohan kii captaini par sijan ke ant tak kaa lagaaya gaya pratibandh kya hataa dena chahie
 Manu and Priyanka again had a debate over this as Priyanka wanted to refuse it, while Manu said that he does not want that
 aakhir main priyanka ko maananaa padaa or donon ne faisla haa main kiya jisase rohan kaaphi khush hue
 On the next order, Bigg Boss asked the family members which two people would be tied to each other till the next order

 In this, Manu and Priyanka chose Rahul Dev and Swami Om and Swami Om looked very happy with this
 task ke baad mona ne gaurav se kaha ki usne bani or gaurav ko ek bandhan main bandhe rahane ke liye vot kiya tha taaki un donon ko saath main rahane kaa mauka miltaa
 At the same time, Bani appeared to Manveer misbehaving with Gaurav's behavior and talking about Nitibha's nomination
 agle faisle ke dauraan big bos ne poocha ki kin teen sadasyon ke bich main captaini kii agali jang hogi
 In it, manveer-bani-lopamudra, nitibha-gaurav-mona and rohan-rahul-swami Om were named as alternatives

 Manu tells Manveer and Mona that people like those three outside a lot
 manu ne manavir ko kaha ki vah itane popular ho gaye hai ki 'big bos' ke 'bi' ho gaye hai
 But there are also some mistakes
 mona ne kaha ki vah hameshaa loyal rahi hai lekin manavir kaa vyavhaar badal gaya he tha
 Out of the interconnected Rahul and Swami Om, Swami Om suddenly left the bond and went to the prison bathroom
 gharavaalon ne unhen baahar aane ko kaha to unhone kaha ki priyanka unhen gaali de rahi he
 There was a fight again between Priyanka and Swami Om
 vahiin mona ne manu se poocha ki ghar se baahar un donon ke bare main kya baat ho rahi he or piku yani manu kii mangetar unke bare main kya kahati hai
 Manu said that Mona's boyfriend Vikrant has many more problems than Piku
