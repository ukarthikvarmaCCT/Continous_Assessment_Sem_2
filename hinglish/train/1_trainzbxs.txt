 He also said in court that the PAC has investigated it
 unhone daawa kiya ki rapat saarvajanik(public domen main) he
 Where is it? Have you seen it i am going to take up the matter with other PAC members
 'court khaarij kar di thi jaanch sambandhi yachikasrvocch nyaayalay ne shuukravaar ko rafel saude kii adaalat kii nigaraanee main jaanch karaane kii maang vaali yachikaayen khaarij kar di thi
 The court had said that the price of the aircraft was shared with the CAG and the report of the CAG was investigated by the PAC
 ab rapat kaa keval sampadit bhaag hi sansad main pesh kiya gaya he or yah saarvajanik he
 'asked the government to mislead the court, accusing the government of' misleading 'the Supreme Court and demanded an apology from the government
 unhone kaha, 'rapat ko abtak sansad main pesh nahin kiya gaya he
 Misinformation was presented in the Supreme Court
 sarvocch nyaayalay main kaig rapat par galat tathy pesh kar adaalat ko gumraah karne ke liye sarkaar ko maafee maangani chahie
 Kharge also said that he respects the Supreme Court, but it is not the investigating agency and only the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) can investigate the alleged corruption in the Rafale case
 kya bole sanjay singh?sanjay singh ne kaha ki jab sieji kii koi jaanch report ai hi nahin to sarkaar ne supreme court se kaise kaha ki aisi koi jaanch report he
 The Attorney General of the government had also told the Supreme Court that they had not read what was given in the sealed envelope, so now how did they give the affidavit of correction? Where did he get that sealed report? The AAP MP said that the Supreme Court order mentions that the Air Force chief had objected to the disclosure of prices
 airforce chif ne yah bayaan kab diya yaa aisa koi affidavit kab diya tha? nae affidavit main bhi sarkaar kah rahi he ki sieji ko keemton ke bare main jaankaree de di gai he lekin sieji kii report to janvari ke baad aegi
 He said that according to the affidavit of the government, the Supreme Court considered that the CAG and PAC were already investigating the prices
 shaayad isi vajah se supreme court ne rafel ghotaale main jaanch ke aadesh nahin die
 If the court had known that no such investigation had taken place, then an inquiry would have been ordered in this case

 We want the Attorney General in the PAC (public Accounts Committee) to be summoned to explain why the affidavits were submitted, which does not really make any mention

 He said that Congress has always been clear in this matter that the Supreme Court is not the right place for this matter, every kind of file cannot be disclosed here

 He further said that press reports and affidavits of the government have been cited in every decision of the Supreme Court

 gaye shuukravaar se hamaare cinemagharon main chal rahi, nirdeshak amit masurkar kii newton taaja hawa ke jhonke kii tarah he
 If you want to know, then remember the movies of Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Sai Paranjpe and Amol Palekar once
 puraa parivaar inhen saath baith kar dekh saktaa tha, kyonki inamen saamaajik sambandhon kaa sahaj sauhaard jhalkata tha, sasti hinsa or nangapan nahin hota tha
 Put a deep political trend in a film of such speed, as it used to be in the films of '80s Shyam Benegal or Govind Nihalani, but removed their horror
 ab ise bunie ek kasi hui patakatha main
 Add to it two such episodes which do not usually come in our films and conversations
 yani anusuchit janajatiyon ke prati prashasan kaa ravaiya, or usee ke bich hote aam chunaav
 Tackle this story into five colliding roles
 phir pakadie aise sadhe hue paanch kalakaar, jo apana kirdaar baariki se, ras main dubo kar nibhaate hai
 This will give an idea of what Masurkar has done by making Newton
 vaise kahani hansi-majaak se ati hui he
 But your heart will cry continuously
 bina kisi kadavaahat ke yah film ham par lagaataar kataaksh karti he, hamaari saamaajik or rajnatik vishmataaon par yah gaharaa vyangy he
 If we are entertained by art, she also shows us her appearance in the mirror
 usamen vah bhi dikhataa he jo ham apane bare main maananaa nahin chaahate
 The story opens with a unique extension of our general election
 hamaara parichay hota he newton se, jiske mata-pita ne uskaa naam rakhaa tha nutan kumaar
 He is an idealist who is mismatched in his family and society
 vah ek sarkari mulajim he, jo apana kaam nishtha se karnaa chahta he
 When the Election Officer is needed to get the votes of 76 people living in the middle of the forest, he is present
 aisa-vaisaa jangal nahin, maovadi vidrohiyon or sashastr balon ke bich fanse chhattisgarh ke jangalon main
 Rajkummar Rao will be remembered in the role of Newton
 unamem kisi paatr ke virodhabhas darshane kaa gun he
 Without chestnut or drama
 unke dhime se jatke bhi jor se lagate hai
 Newton sincerely wants tribal voters to get votes
 nirvachan dal ko jangal se hote hue, gaanv tak le jane kaa jimmaa he sashastr bal ke afasar aatma ram (pankaj treepathi) kaa
 In Newton's allegiance, the soul Ram sees a new mullah, because he does not want to go to the forest
 vah adivaasiyon ko tiraskaar se dekhtaa he
 The tribal teacher Malko (anjali Patil) and the beaten writer-turned-government babu-turned Loknath (raghubir Yadav) are trapped in the tension between these two
 malko agar kahani ko newton kii naitikta kii ore khinchati he, to hansod lokanath use aatma ram ke paas le aate hai
 Gradually one realizes how the tribals have an edge over such people
 in samaajon main sarvasammati se faisle lene kaa loktantric chalan pehle se rahaa he
 But there is no place for them in our new democracy
 newton jab malko se poochta he ki kya vah bhi nirashaavadi he, to vah jawaab detii he, ''nahin, main adivasee hum
 "whenever our films depict social subjects seriously, they come with reformist teachings
 jaise darshak na hue, abodh bachche ho gaye, jinhen thok-peet kar adarsh naagarik banane kaa jimmaa filmkaar kaa hi he
 Newton does nothing like this, only showing and entertaining an interesting story, with such grief that tough questions arise in the viewer's mind
 aise sawaal jinka koi aasaan jawaab nahin he, jo hamaare tii
 V
 channelon par bhi nahin puche jate
 But these questions are important for us
 inamen hamaara jameer jhalkata he
 Each character is shown with compassion
 aakhir main aatma ram or unka parivaar jaitoon kaa tel kharidte dikhte hai, kyonki yah aaj vikaas kaa tel maan liya gaya he
 Mining company mines open on tribal forest
 malko newton se milane aati he, donon chaay pine jane vaale hai
 The story, which shows so much mess, ends on a beautiful possibility
 shaayad sarkaar bhi adivasee samaaj se mili, baatcheet se samajhadaari kaa rasta nikle

 He was safely taken out
 enditivi india ne usase jab baat kerani chaahi to use roak diya gaya
 The college administration took him on a run
 college main sabase kaha gaya he ki jo janaa chahen, ve ja sakate hai
 But students caught in the muddle of security and career are unable to decide
 ek chaatr ne kaha, "ham sab imtihaan dena chaahate hai lekin kya ho rahaa he samaj nahin aa rahaa
 "by the way many local students also went to their house to prepare for the examination
 ek sthaneey chaatr ne kaha, "college main aap dekh rahe ho kaisaa maahaul he, yahaan kaise padhai hogi isiilie ghar ja rahe hai
 " duusare chaatr ne kaha, "andar claces ho rahi hai
 We are all now preparing for the exam
 " vaise 11 april kii parikshaayen tal bhi sakati hai
 However, the administration has made it clear that if the examinations are not postponed, the examinations of the children outside will be done later
 phir ye imtihaan bahari logon kii nigaraanee main honge
 The parents have their own questions amid so many consolations
 ek chintit maa ne enditivi ko campus ke baahar bataaya, "ham apni bacchee se mil kar aae hai, rose akhbaaron or tivi main jo dekh rahe hai usase dar gaye the
 "on the other hand, NIT has turned into a military camp like Srinagar
 baahar vaale chaatro ke dar alag hai to sthaneey chaatro ke alag
 On Friday, they could not even enter the campus
 ek sthaneey chaatr ne bataaya, "andar itani police he ki kya boluun, bura lagata he, hamen khud andar kai jagah jane nahin diya ja rahaa, hamaare khud ke college main ham par shaq kar rahe hai

 jab netaa or media yahaan se nikal jaaenge to aakhirkaar chaatro ko hi saath rahanaa hoga
 In college, it has been said that those who want to go can go
 lekin suraksha or kariyar ke kashmakash main fanse chaatr tay nahin kar paa rahe
 One student said, "we all want to test, but i do not understand what is happening

 An anxious mother told NDTV outside the campus, "we have come to meet our baby girl, scared of what she is seeing in newspapers and TV everyday
" " udhar enaiti srinagar jaise faujee shivi main tabdeel ho gaya he
 Fear of outside students is different and local students are different

 a local student told, "there is so much police inside, what to say, it feels bad, we are not being allowed to go to many places inside ourselves, suspecting us in our own college
" " Amidst this tension, the matter is becoming a confrontation between locals and outsiders
 shikshak maayoos hai ki unpar bharosa nahin kiya ja rahaa
 They are reminding that local people helped these people in a crisis like flood
 sheikh mubashir jo bi-tech padhaate hai, unhone bataaya, "ham logon ne inhen apane bacchon kii tarah rakhaa, ab ham par ilzaam lag rahaa he, bahut dukh ho rahaa he

 But now gradually the color is returning to these markets

 ' Prashant Bhushan, a member of the Joint Drafting Committee formed on the Lokpal Bill, has fiercely lobbied to put the Prime Minister's post within the ambit of this proposed bill
 lokapal vidheyak ko ek agast se shuru hone vaale monsoon satr main sansad main pesh kiya janaa he
 Senior advocates say that those people who do not come to the 'ABC' of the constitution, are chanting to keep the top political post 'sensitive' out of the purview of the Prevention of Corruption Bill
 bhashaai patrakarita mahotsav ke silsile main yahaan aaye bhushan ne kaha, ‘aisa lagata he ki sarkaar pradhanmantri pad ko lokapal vidheyak ke daayre se baahar rakhane par adi hui he
 But it has no basis
 ’ unhone jor dekar kaha ki pradhanmantri pad bhrashtachar kii jaanch se aaj bhi pare nahin he or sibiai yah jaanch kar sakati he
 Bhushan said, 'since the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is under the Prime Minister
 lihaaja hamaara kahana he ki sheersh raajnneetik pad ke khilaaf jaanch kaa tabhi koi matlab nikalegaa, jab yah adhikaar lokapal jaisi sarkaar se swatantra agency ko ho
 He said, "those people who do not have the understanding of the Constitution even to the ABC, are saying that the Prime Minister's post should be outside the purview of the Prevention of Corruption Bill
" yah ek basir pair kii baat he
 The senior counsel said that to keep the Prime Minister's office out of the purview of the Lokpal Bill, it is being argued that it is a 'sensitive' position
 lekin duniya main aisa koi bhi ‘swatantra’ or ‘sabhy’ desh nahin he, jahaan karypalika kaa pramukh bhrashtachar kii jaanch se pare ho
 However, based on the current indications of the government, Bhushan was asked what would be the stand of the Gandhian Anna Hazare if the Prime Minister's post was not included in the scope of the Lokpal Bill to be introduced in Parliament
 Do not consider the issue as such, which cannot be negotiated at present
 jab is mudde par samvidhan kii roshni main charchaa hogi, to sari sthiti apane aap spasht ho jaayegi
 He said that the current stand of the government on the Lokpal Bill is 'wrong' and shows that it is not serious about taking concrete steps against corruption
 bhrashtachar par prabhavi roak ke liye majboot lokapal vidheyak kii anivaary jarurat kii baat doharaate hue bhushan ne kaha, ‘anna hajaare pehle hi ghoshit kar chuke hai ki agar sarkaar sansad main lachar lokapal vidheyak prastut karegi to ek baar phir anshan kiya jaayegaa

 ""main apni agali zindagi main kavi banane kii jagah kavita bananaa chahta hum, kyonki kavita rachane vaale se zyada kavita kii ahmiyat kahin zyada hoti he
 It was a very special feeling for me when Narendra Modi read my poem twice

 At present, sports lovers are convinced of the batting of Dhoni and Kohli

 The team has arrested three people, including former PNB deputy manager Gokulnath Shetty, who issued fake lous

 All three will be produced in CBI special court today
 is farjivade par sattadhari bhartiya janata party or mukhya vipakshi dal congress aamane-saamne hai
 Both national parties are claiming the birth of this scam in each other's tenure
 vahiin, is bich ye jaankaree saamne aa rahi he ki 11,400 karod rupee ke is mahaghotaale ke zyaadaatar saakh patr yani letters of anderstanding (lous) 2017-18 ke dauraan jari kiye gaye yaa unhen rineau kiya gaya
 According to the news of English newspaper Indian Express, another FIR has been registered in this regard on Thursday
 jiske tahat ghotaale ke mukhya aaropee mehul chokasee or neerav modi ne apni teen companiyon ke jariye punjab neshnal bank se 4,886
 72 crores achieved
 bank se ye rakam 143 aloyu ke jariye hasil kii gai
 The newspaper has written on the basis of the first FIR of this case that 280 in the first case through 8 lous
 7 karod rupee ke ghotaale kii baat saamne ai thi
 It has also been written in the FIR that these lous were released in 2017
 ab sibiai ne pienbi se mili nai jaankaree is exiaar main jodi he, jiske aadhaar par pehali exiaar ke tahat kareeb 6,498 karod ke ghotaale kaa maamla ban rahaa he
 The CBI has also questioned bank officials in this regard, in which it has come out that Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi also did a game of renewing LOU and got a huge amount
 darasal, ye cese punjab neshnal bank kii mumbai shakha se jari 143 saakh patron se sambandhit he
 On the basis of these letters of credit, Rs 4,886 crore was released in a fraudulent manner
 yah raashi teen companiyon gitanjali james, nakshatra or gili ko 2017-18 main jari kii gai
 However, the entire case is of 293 letters of credit worth Rs 11,400 crore

 Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said that on 13 September 2013, Rahul Gandhi went to Nirav Modi's jewelery exhibition at a hotel in Delhi and the next day Allahabad Bank approved his loan
 jabaki bank ke ek nideshak dinesh doobe ne iskaa virodh kiya tha
 The charge of Congress is that the Congress has directly surrounded Prime Minister Narendra Modi in this matter
 congress ne aarope lagaaya ki saat may 2015 ko vaibhav khurania naam ke ek shaks ne pradhanmantri karyaalay (piemo) ko is ghotaale kii jaankaree di thi lekin unhone koi karrwai nahin kii
 Congress media in-charge Randeep Surjewala questioned why BJP and Modi government were silent on this issue? Also how were Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi 'allowed' to flee
 itnaa hi nahin surajevaala ne ye bhi daawa kiya he ki bharat kaa sabase bada bank lut ghotaalaa badhkar ab 21,306 karod kaa ho gaya he
 However, the entire matter is still being investigated
 idi lagaataar chhapemari kar neerav modi kii sampatti jabt kar rahi he
 At the same time, the passports of the accused have also been given

 The issue of sealing in the country's capital has once again gained momentum
 dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh va saansdamanoj tiwaridvara ek dairy ke sil tode jane ke baad raajnneetik sargarmi tej ho gai he
 The trade wing of the Aam Aadmi Party has openly challenged Manoj Tiwari and invited him for a debate on the issue of sealing
 'aap' trade wing ne is sandarbh main patr likhte hue manoj tiwari ko bahes ke liye samay va sthaan bataane ke liye poocha he
 AAP Trade Wing convener Brijesh Goel says that the way Manoj Tiwari broke the seal of a dairy, it was nothing but a stunting
 lekin unki is stantbaaji se dilli ke vyapaariyon ko ceiling kii musiibat se nijaat nahin mil rahi he
 The trade wing of the Aam Aadmi Party says that there is a need for open debate on the issue of sealing so that it is clear to the public who is responsible for the ceiling and who has the solution to the sealing problem
 AAP trade wing ke manoj tiwari se 4 sawaal
 
 
 1- Sealing has been going on in Delhi for the last 10 months
 hajaaron dukaane va factriyaan sil ho chuki hai
 Where were you while the ceiling was being done? Why remain silent? 2- Why did you not raise such a burning issue in Parliament session as the President and MP of Delhi BJP? Despite the BJP government in the MCD and the BJP in the central government, why were the ordinances not provided relief to the traders? What is the plan of the government and the party? 4- Just like you have broken a foreign seal, will you break the seal of other seal shops? desh, duniya, mahanagar, khel, aarthik or bollywood main kya kuch hua

 But there are some people who believe in facing life instead of cursing luck
 31 saal kii ela wine kii kahani bhi kuch aisi hi he
 Ella was a victim of domestic violence in childhood
 uske baad bhi jindagi ne unhen bahut se bure din dikhaae lekin wo uthin or khud ko sabit kiya
 Today he is a successful business woman
 ela mul rup se poland kii rahane vaali hai lekin ab asex main rahati hai
 At the age of 17, Ella was forced to live on the road
 FEMAIL se baat karte hue ela kahati hai , 'mujhe bachapan kii zyada baaten yaad nahin he
 i have blocked those bad memories
 bachapan main gharelu hinsa, 17 saal kii umr main sadak par sona or spinal injuri ke baad aapangata jhelane ke baavjood maine kabhi haar nahin maani
 'ella launched the world's first magnetic suspension belt and also became a plus size model
 ela kahati hai, 'jab mere paas rahane ko ghar nahin tha tab main bahut se aise logon se mili jo meri tarah beghar the
 i heard their stories
 -20 degree taapmaana main sadakon par rahanaa aasaan nahin hota
 But this experience did not disappoint me
 yah meri jindagi ke liye sikh thi
 'ella was Chase Champion at the age of 8
 jab wo beghar ho gayi to ek parivaar ne unhen aasraa diya
 She went on to study at GCSE and graduated from two universities in three subjects, politics, social service and community development
 lekin yahaan dukhon kaa ant nahin tha
 a tragedy occurred with Ella again
 unhen chronic fatig syndrome ho gaya
 She fell completely in bed, but the stubbornness of living was still there
 meditation, arts or creativity ne unhen chah maheene main hi thik kar diya
 Talking about her innovation, Ella says that women all over the world had to work very hard to add suspension belts to stockings
 isse samay kii barbaadi bhi hoti thi
 i made a suspension belt that connects to the stocking with a magnetic clip
 yah fast or bahut comfortable he
 It took me a year to make it
 marks and spencer ke purv lingeri head jaik leven kehete hai, 'yah magnetic clip mahilaon or unke parteners ke liye bahut hi phydemand he
 Production will be faster with this innovation

 People like cash
 The government is constantly trying to promote the cashless economy
 modi sarkaar ne is vitt varsh main 25 arab cashles tranjaction kaa lakshya rakhaa he, lekin logon kaa cash ke prati jhukaav is lakshya ko hasil karne main deree kar saktaa he
 According to the Reserve Bank of India, Rs 1,31,81,190 crore is currently in cash circulation
 ye sthiti tab he, jab modi sarkaar ke alaava nijee companiyaan bhi cashles tranjaction ko badhaava dene ke liye lagaataar prayasarat he
 Actually, despite the steps being taken by the Modi government to promote digital payments, there are many reasons behind making cash the first choice
 bahut saare vikalp, kam jaagruktakashles pement karne ke liye upiai, bhim ap or mobile wolet samet kai vikalp bazaar main maujuud hai
 Apart from UPI, Bhima, the option of Aadhaar Pay has also been given by the Government of India
 iske alaava mobile wolet, bank eps samet anya kai vikalp hai, jinke jariye koi bhi vyakti cashles tanjaction kar saktaa he
 Confusion among people may seem so many options at first sight, but they also create confusion in the minds of people
 itane opshan hone ke baavjood agar cashles tranjaction nahin bad rahe, to isaki ek badi vajah jaagrukta kaa na hona he
 There are still many people in India who also need help to withdraw money from atms
 aise main agar ham in logon ko cashles tranjaction karne ke liye prerit karnaa chaahate hai, te unhen inhen istemaal karne ko lekar jaagruk karne kii jarurat he
 There will be an increase in rural areas
 Even though there is a stir in mobile cities and mobile wallets and cashless transactions, in rural areas this movement is very less
 aise main gramin kshetron main cashles tranjaction ko badhaava dene ke liye bhi jaagrukta kii jarurat he
 They should not only be told about these options but should also be taught to use them
 kaarobaariyon ko dena hoga protsaahanbhale hi sarkaarkashles tranjactionako badhaava de rahi he, lekin kaarobaariyon or dukandaaron ko pioes mashin kaa yuj karne ke liye charge bharna padataa he
 If this charge is to be deducted
 iske saath hi cashles pement karne ke liye agar dukandaaron ko incentive diya jaataa he, to yah bhi cash yuj ko kam kar saktaa he
 The number of POS machines has more than 700 million debit card users, but the number of point of sales (POS) is quite small
 aise main pioes kii sankhya badaye jane par bhi sarkaar ko dhyaan dena hoga
 debit-credit Charge Reduced Many banks today charge a fee for making transactions by debit and credit card
 bank agar in chargees ko kam yaa khatm karne par vichaar karen, to yah bhi cashles iconomi ko boost dene vaala kadam sabit ho saktaa he

 jharkhand kii rajdhani ranchi main ab khule main shouch karne waalon kii khayr nahin
 The Ranchi Municipal Corporation has launched a 'halla Bol, lungi khol' campaign against open defecation
 iske tahat nagar nigam kii enforcement team tadake subah un jagahon par dhaava bolti he jahaan log aksar khule main shouch ke liye jate hai
 In one such case, it became expensive for the people of Harmu to defecate in the open
 yahaan khule shouch kar rahe logon ko nagar nigam kii enforcement team ne pakadaa or unkilungi utarava lee, yahi nahin unki lungi ko jabt bhi kar liya gaya
 Everyone kept asking for their lungi back, but no one listened to them, later when the people caught again swore not to defecate in the open and paid a fine of Rs 100, the municipal team returned the lungi

 Most of the districts of Jharkhand have been declared ODF as per official figures, except 5 districts of Jharkhand have been declared open defecation free

 At the same time, toilets that have been built in many places are not being looked after equally
 aise main log bhi khule main shouch ke liye majaboor hai
 In the way, this campaign of the Municipal Corporation has also become a cause of great trouble for many

 View this post on instagrama film that was born in my heart and mind 15 years ago
 
 
 
 a film i passionately believe in
 
 
 the last film my father worked on before he left us
 
 
 
 it was his dream to see this film come through
 
 
 
 i couldn't fulfill his dream then
 
 
 
 my spirit was broken
 
 
 
 but today his wish has found a relationship with celluloid
 
 
 
 the story of turbulent relationships and eternal love has found a voice
 
 
 
 the film has been woven, nurtured and visualized by ABHISHEK VARMAN
 
 
 
 and the film Is KALANK! Set in the 40's but it's heart lives on
 
 
 
 
 TOMORROW the journey begins
 
 
 
 
 am excited
 
 
 anxious and emotional about this one
 
 
 i do hope you join us on our path to undying love

 The Love Jihad movement is the latest attempt at communal mobilization in the name of women
 bataur itihaaskaar main isaki jaden aupniveshik ateet main bhi dekhati hum
 Whenever the atmosphere of communal tension and riots has strengthened, then such myths and propaganda have emerged
 in prachaaron main muslim purush ko vishesh rup se ek aparankarta ke rup main pesh kiya gaya he or ek ‘kaamuk’ muslim kii tasviir gadhi gai he
 i have worked on the emerging relationship between communalism and sexism in Uttar Pradesh in the 1920–30s
 us daur main lav jehad shabd kaa istemaal nahin hua tha lekin us samay main bhi kai hindu sanghathanon—arya samaaj, hindu mahasabha aadi—ke ek bade hisse ne muslim gundon ke hindu mahilaon ke apharan or dharm parivartan kii anek kahaniyaan prachaarit kin
 He gave provocative and rhetorical statements in which innumerable stories of Muslim atrocities on Hindu women and adultery were fabricated
 in vaktavyon kaa aisa sailaab aayaa ki hindu mahilaon ke saath balaatkaar, aakraamak vyavhaar, apharan, bahlaana-phuslaana, dharmantaran or musalmaan purushon se jabaran hindu mahilaon kii shaadiyon kii kahaniyon kii lambii suchi banati gai
 Inter-religious marriages, love, cohabitation and conversion of a woman on her own will also collectively fall into the category of kidnapping and forced conversion
 tab or ab ke abhiyaan main kai or mudde bhi jude hai
 Hindu campaigners feel that this can bypass the caste discrimination in our society and unify Hindu collectivity
 agar ham goraksha kaa mudda len to yah daliton ko aakarshith nahin karegaa
 But the issue of women is such that all Hindus can be mobilized keeping caste out
 stri kaa sharir hindu prachaarkon ke liye ek kendriya chinh ban jaataa he
 Both Love Jihad and the abduction movement are also related to the question of the number of Hindus
 baar-baar kaha jaataa he ki hindu mahilaayein musalmaan purushon se vivaah kar rahi hai or musalamaanon kii sankhya badha rahi hai
 Various surveys have completely dismissed this fact
 asal main hindu prachaarvaadi is tarah ke abhiyaanon ke jariye hindu mahila ke prajnan par bhi niyantatran karnaa chaahate hai
 i believe that every rape or forced conversion should be investigated and the culprits should be punished
 lekin samasya us vakt paidaa hoti he jab ham alag-alag ghatnaon ko ek hi chashme se dekhne lagate hai, jab ham pyaar, romance or har antardharmee vivaah ko jabaran dharmantaran ke nazariye se jaanchane lagate hai
 It is worth noting that in the 1920-30s, many such cases were reported in which women married to Muslim men on their own free will
 inamen vishesh taur par ve striyaan thim jo hindu samaaj ke haashie par thim, jaise vidhwaaen, dalit striyaan or kuch veshyaayein bhi
 Widow marriage among Hindus was nominal then
 aise main kai vidhwaaon ne musalamaanon se vivaah rachaaya
 We also get their information from the police and CID reports of that time
 yah bhi kitna virodhabhasi he ki hindutvvaadi prachaar main hindu stri jab musalmaan purush se vivaah karti he to use apharan ke taur par pesh kiya jaataa he
 When a Muslim woman marries a Hindu man, she is labeled as love
 aupniveshik uttar pradesh main bhi aisi kai kahaniyaan-upanyaas likhe gaye, jinamein aise hindu purushon ko adbhut nayak ke rup main pesh kiya gaya jo kisi musalmaan stri se pyaar karne main safal hota tha
 a famous novel, Shivaji and Roshanara, was published at this time, which was quoted as historical by quoting unproven sources
 isamen maratha parampara kaa rang bharkar darshaya gaya ki shivaji ne aurangzeb kii bahan roshanara kaa dil jeeta
 Married her, which is not a historical fact
 lav jehad jaise andolan hindu stri kii suraksha karne ke naam par asal main uski youniktaa, uski ichha or uski swatantra pahchaan par niyantran lagaana chaahate hai
 Also, they often depict Hindu women as if they can be easily lured
 uskaa apana vajood, apni koi ichha ho sakati he, yaa vah khud antardharmik prem or vivaah kaa kadam uthaa sakati he—is soch ko darkinar kar diya jaataa he
 i also see a fear behind it because women are now taking their own decisions
 nafrat failaane vaale abhiyaanon kii ek anya visheshta hoti he—ek hi baat kaa doharaav, jisase vah logon ke saamaanya gyaan main shumaar ho jaae
 Such false repetition is very visible in the Love Jihad movement, which strengthens communalism
 lav jehad main kai nai chijen bhi shaamil hui hai, jisamen musalamaanon ke khilaaf uchhaali gai nai shabdaawalee bhi he—aatankwaad or aatankwaadi musalmaan, muslim sampradayikta, aakraamak muslim noujvaan, videshi fund or antarrashtriya sajeesh
 This kind of propaganda has increased the communal atmosphere, but it is also true that women have made a dent in the efforts of communal mobilization through inter-religious love and marriage
 ambedkar ne kaha tha ki antarjaateey vivaah jatvaad ko khatm kar saktaa he
 Inter-religious marriage, i believe, can weaken religious identity
 mahilaon ne apane str par is tarah ke sampradayik prachaaron par kai baar kaan nahin dharaa he
 Women who perform inter-religious marriages somewhere break into community and communal fortifications
 romance or pyaar is tarah ke prachaar ko dhwast kar saktaa he

 panne 255uske liye, jisane mujhe sabase zyada pyaar tab kiya, jab main khud se jaraa bhi pyaar nahin karti thi
 Kali Puri's story about weight loss, written on the Confession of a Serial Dieter's dedication page, narrates everything in a way
 'khud karke siikho' style main likhi gai yah kitaab bedaul se sudaul sharir paane kii yaadon par aadhaarit vrutant he
 It is a 'serial diator' sabbatical three decades and 43 curious ways of weight loss journey - which ultimately ends up going to weight nirvana - from 100 kg to 60 kg
 yah kitaab us desh main ek nai vidha kii shuruyaat he, jahaan vajan kam karne kii salaah yaa to yoga guruon ke paavan kaaryakshetra se aati he, yaa ''dublepan ke doctoron or feet rakhane vaale diaticiyanon'' kii duniya se
 21 December 2011: Look in the pictures, India has never mentioned love in the guide books written by experts today, but it is so in Puri's book
 ve likhti hai, ''pyaar ek laajawab prerana he
 "in England's bitter morning, despite numb fingers, it is love that gets her involved in sailing as a student at Oxford; Get rid of their much-loved crunch cheese crackers and chocolate; Makes a living on Idli and Bhelpuri; On home video, Jane hooks up with Fonda and dedicates to India's first weight loss center in front of the Vibration Machines
 ve kahati hai, ''main is kaarykram par dati rahi, kyonki mere saamne ek dedline thi, ek lavaline
 "in the journey of 18 to 24 years, Prem made his weight from 75 kg to 58 kg

 The big difference between the journey of gurus and Puri, who are looking for ways to reduce Indian social life, is that they go through those paths She has done and seen everything

 Puri's own creation in the new year: Champagne Diet
 jashn manaao or vajan ghatao
 i was born before the book part time, the weight was only 2
 5 kilogram
 i was a year old, then overweight — and this was when my choice of food was limited to mashed apples and bananas
 chaar saal kii umr main, main pre-skool main apane doston ke saath khaane kii adla-badali karne main sakasham thi
 i used to have their chocolate truffle pastry and they had my bottle filled with tap water
 main chaar saal kii hi umr main apni pehali dit par thi
 i never looked back after that
 uske baad se main dit (khanpan) or workout (kasarat) ke 40 program aajamaa chuki hum
 Some of them have been done twice
 main kabool karti hum ki main ek serial diater hum
 i have already done 55 kg and 104 kg
 meri kaabiliyat kii ek vajandaar list he
 i am not a guru
 dublaa banane vaale doctor or feet rakhane vaale diatician vajan ghataane ke healdi tareekon ke bare main lagaataar baaten kar sakate hai, lekin ve ek mote insaan kaa jehan, mood or uski bechaargi nahin samajhte
 He never wore that fat suit
 unhone us raah par kabhi chalakar nahin dekha hota he
 But since they meet and help so many people with the same problem, they have some really good solutions and approaches
 iske baavjood baat vahi nahin hoti
 Dieticians and trainers can tell you what to do and can help you do it
 lekin unhone khud vah nahin kiya hota he jo maine kiya he
 One well-known fable about rejuvenation is The Ugly Duckling
 ek badsoorat battakh khubasurat hans main badal jaati he
 Everybody shies away from her when she is ugly
 vah akeli or dukhi hoti he
 But when she becomes a beautiful swan, everyone wants her and wants to befriend her
 nitikthaayen daraavnee or paaramparik soch se alag hoti hai, lekin ham isi sab ke saath bade hue hote hai
 It is built in your mind and heart: there are no thick and ugly mushrooms; Every heart is thin and beautiful
 lekin ek baar jab aap apana vajan 20 kilo yaa usase zyada kam kar lete hai, to yah ek badsoorat battakh ke ek khubasurat hans main badal jane jaisaa badlaav nahin hota; yah purna badlaav hota he, kayakalp
 The rejuvenation of this variety is similar to that of an insect becoming a butterfly

 Losing 45 kg of weight is the same

 Today, people often ask me, "where did you leave the rest of you?" They don't realize how close they are to the truth

 i have lost 45 kg and the count continues

 They are all easily visible parts of the body - stomach, hip, thighs; Hard parts like hands and calves; And more often the upper part of the body

 i am ten points shorter in terms of dress size, from size 18 to size 8
 maine duusare angon main bhi vajan kam kiya he, un hisson se, jahaan charbi jamaa ho jaati he or aapako pataa bhi nahin chalata
 Fat is among those who kill without making a sound, it gathers around you, making you sluggish, slow and useless
 charbi sankramak hoti he, lihaaja aapkaa dimag bhi apni dhar khone lagata he
 He too becomes dull like the body in which he lives

 9 November 2011: See India Today in pictures 2 November 201: See India Today in pictures What is the boundary line, when you know that you are capable of fighting greed? When you get out of the house, and do not blindly return after eating and drinking? It is a complex equation of your basic weight, target weight and willpower
 lekin main aasaani se kah sakati hum ki baaji palatney ke liye 5 se 7 kilo vajan kam kar lenaa kaaphi he
 And if your weight is 20 kg or even more than your ideal weight, then it is not very difficult to reduce 5 kg, but it is good in terms of weight loss
 or aap is kam kiye gaye vajan ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye prerit hai
 So, even when there is greed, your brain gives you other advice and you are able to stop greed
 to, main socialise kaise hoti thi?sach to yah he ki main hoti hi nahin thi, apni pahal par to nahin
 It was very difficult for me to get out at night
 ek, kyonki dinar kii yojana kaa matlab hota tha ki main teble par baithkar dit coke piti rahuungi or baaki logon ko daavat udaate dekhati rahuungi
 Although it made me feel better than others, i had to clean my entire diet, which led to guilt among others
 cocktail partiyon main drinks or snacks bahut zyada lalachaate the
 Just a battered prawn dipped in sweet chili sauce, a crispy springing roll, a tandoori cheese, a slice of California sushi and that's all
 mere shuhar mujhe itnaa pyaar karte the ki ve mujhe baahar jane ke liye majaboor nahin karte the
 He never insisted that i have dinner with him
 main bechaari maheenon tak akele khaanaa khaati rahi
 But i can also imagine him, the changes were encouraging because he did not want his 100 kg wife back
 unhone kabhi jor nahin daalaa ki main vajan kam karun, kyonki iskaa ant jhgade main nikalataa tha, lekin unhone saporting bhoomika auskar puraskaar laayak dhang se adaa kii
 For two months i did not get out at night
 main itnaa bharaa pet mahasoos karti thi ki mujhe khaane kaa laalach nahin hota tha
 Truth be told, the no-dinner rule of dieting is arguably stricter, as most times around socializing diners
 or laalach se bachane kaa sabase acha tarika he ki usase dur rahaa jaae
 You have to pay the price
 or chukaane ke lihaaj se yah ek choti-si keemat he
 i started meeting friends over coffee instead
 mujhe chah baje coffee pine kii ijaajat thi
 He used to be my dinner
 isane bakhubi kaam kiya
 i allowed myself to go to diners and parties only when my mind became stronger, my stomach became smaller and my wardrobe became more attractive
 jab ek baar sharir nae routine main ram jaataa he, to aapkaa kam ho chukaa vajan aapako dhokhaa na dene ke liye prerit or protsaahit karata he
 Instead of tasting everything your mind, body, soul get caught in the control of looking good
 jab maine behatar dikhnaa or mahasoos karnaa shuru kiya to mujhe baahar janaa acha lagane laga
 My plan was to have less of dinner and more of showing my new dress
 main ek gilaas shampen yaa white wine piti thi or kisi or cheez ke liye apana munh nahin kholti thi
 Not even tasting the world's best dishes
 kabhi-kabhi main der se ghar lautati thi or fal yaa dahi khaati thi
 Once i broke the eating pattern late at night, in the morning i felt quite good
 main tarotaaja or bhukhi thi or kasarat karne or naashtaa karne ke liye taiyaar thi
 i always felt lethargic, nauseous, and did not feel hungry for breakfast when i slept late and fiercely after dinner
 xxrep 5 * bahan kii shaadi apana vajan kam karne kii bahut badhiya vajah he
 The wedding was two months later and i felt that my body was not ready to accept a weight of less than 80 kg

 Everyone used to tell me how good i look
 pehle to maine un par vishwaas kar liya, isse or vajan kam karne kii prerana kamjor pad gai
 But when i saw the photos, i came to know that they were all lying
 yaa ho saktaa he, unhone na bolaa ho
 His praise was comparative

 Luckily for me, one marriage was not enough and my sister was getting remarried

 The wedding was to be Christian in France within five months

 meri mekaover team (diaticiuns, trainurs or diziners) bhi utane hi josh main the, jitani main
 They wanted me to be seen dressed now
 shaadi ke liye ravaanaa hone ke pehle unhen poshaak pahan kar dikhaane kaa vakt nahin tha
 France was calling
 france ne raste par atal rahane ke liye ek prerana kaa kaam kiya
 When i returned from marriage, i still had to fit in the same dress so that i could show it to the team who first helped me to get into this dress
 shaadi shandaar thi
 It took place in the small village Annecy near a lake
 shaadi main khaane kii badi bhoomika thi
 The role of Champagne was even bigger than that
 mere bahanoi french hai
 When Indians marry, they take their families with them; French, yes, they just carry champagne
 ham use aise pi rahe the, jaise pani pi rahe hon
 Our mornings started with champagne and egg bhurji and the eating process continued throughout the day and late at night, when we finished it by drinking champagne
 or uske baad sadak yaa aapke kamare tak lift ke liye bhi ek shampen
 We were brushing our teeth with the same thing
 main kai hafton se bahut zyada vanchit thi
 And it was expected to be a big tragedy
 yahaan dhire-dhire talmail baitaane kii koi prakriya nahin thi
 One day i was eating curd-papaya and the other day i was very deep in the world of French pastries, cheese, baguettes, quesons and champagne
 ek galat desh main laaparvaahee
 But i was surprisingly good
 main suryanamaskara rojaanaa karti thi
 That too in France, where hotel rooms are known to be very small
 main do bistaron ke bich kii tang jagah par khadi ho jaati thi or usee se kaam chalaa leti thi
 What happened to me? Well, i had to fit in the same dress even after returning and i didn't feel good until i had done 15 to 20 minutes of yoga
 yah mere system main rach-bas gaya tha
 i was getting that kind of yoga
 yaa ho saktaa he shampen mere dimag ke saath sharaarat kar rahi ho
 This routine was also going to work for that idea
 aisi dit jisamen dher sari shampen shaamil ho
 xxrep 5 * You have already been warned
 aap saare diaticians or trainurs jab yah padhenge, to bidak jaaenge, lekin yah kitaab vahi sab bataane ke liye he, jo aapane khaaya he
 So please leave this part
 baaki saare serial diaters-aap padhate chalo
 This diet is non-traditional and has its roots not in knowledge but in experience
 or mujhe yah har haal main behad pasand he
 This is completely my own mix
 or har mahaan avishkaar kii tarah yah khoj bhi bas sanyogvash ho gai thi
 But i tested it and tested it
 maine isamen sudhaar kiya
 And you are getting a perfectly cut shape of it
 lekin main is sach se zyada kisi cheez kii jimmedaari nahin leti ki maine ise kiya he or yah mere liye kargar rahaa he
 This is the best diet for the week you are having a party — such as a wedding or a long weekend
 jaisaa ki maine aapako pehle bataaya tha, mere bahanoi french hai
 They drink champagne like the British drink tea
 kabhi bhi, kahin bhi
 He used to come home for tea and it was a simple tea-samosa-jalebi case
 jab main unase puuchhati thi ki ve kya pinaa pasand karenge, to ve pal bhar ke liye asahaj lagate the, yakeen karne ke liye meri bahan kii taraf dekhte the or jab vah swechha se thandi saans bharti thi, to ve kehete the, ''shampen, plis!'' shaam chaar baje! kyonki jahaan tak mujhe yaad he, hamaara paramparaagat ravivaariya paariwarik lunch chikan biryani or parantha hota tha, vah menu, jo pidiyon se chalaa aa rahaa he
 There was no reshuffling, but since a Frenchman joined the family, champagne has become an inevitable new addition to the Sunday routine
 ab yah ek paariwarik parampara ban gai he
 The result is that i have become quite addicted to champagne
 or is dit kii shuruyaat yaheen se hoti he
 Before i was born, the weight was only 2
 5 kilogram
 i was a year old, then overweight — and this was when my choice of food was limited to mashed apples and bananas
 chaar saal kii umr main, main pre-skool main apane doston ke saath khaane kii adla-badali karne main sakasham thi
 i used to have their chocolate truffle pastry and they had my bottle filled with tap water
 main chaar saal kii hi umr main apni pehali dit par thi
 i never looked back after that
 uske baad se main dit (khanpan) or workout (kasarat) ke 40 program aajamaa chuki hum
 Some of them have been done twice
 28 sitambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india today21 sitambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india today7sitambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india todemain kabool karti hum ki main ek serial diater hum
 i have already done 55 kg and 104 kg
 meri kaabiliyat kii ek vajandaar list he
 i am not a guru
 dublaa banane vaale doctor or feet rakhane vaale diatician vajan ghataane ke healdi tareekon ke bare main lagaataar baaten kar sakate hai, lekin ve ek mote insaan kaa jehan, mood or uski bechaargi nahin samajhte
 He never wore that fat suit
 unhone us raah par kabhi chalakar nahin dekha hota he
 But since they meet and help so many people with the same problem, they have some really good solutions and approaches
 iske baavjood baat vahi nahin hoti
 Dieticians and trainers can tell you what to do and can help you do it
 lekin unhone khud vah nahin kiya hota he jo maine kiya he
 One well-known fable about rejuvenation is The Ugly Duckling
 ek badsoorat battakh khubasurat hans main badal jaati he
 Everybody shies away from her when she is ugly
 vah akeli or dukhi hoti he
 But when she becomes a beautiful swan, everyone wants her and wants to befriend her
 nitikthaayen daraavnee or paaramparik soch se alag hoti hai, lekin ham isi sab ke saath bade hue hote hai
 It is built in your mind and heart: there are no thick and ugly mushrooms; Every heart is thin and beautiful
 lekin ek baar jab aap apana vajan 20 kilo yaa usase zyada kam kar lete hai, to yah ek badsoorat battakh ke ek khubasurat hans main badal jane jaisaa badlaav nahin hota; yah purna badlaav hota he, kayakalp
 The rejuvenation of this variety is similar to that of an insect becoming a butterfly
 yah roopantaran sirf duusare tarah kaa najar aane kaa nahin, balki duusare dhang se jeene kaa maamla he
 Butterfly and Worm lead two separate lives
 ek najuk, aakarshak or khubasurat hoti he
 Secondly thick, fluffy and fluffy
 ek mandaraati or udati he
 The second moves by flailing
 ek sirf phulon kaa ras piti he, duusari ko jo mil jaataa he, vahi kha leti he
 Losing 45 kg of weight is the same
 isane mujhe ek bilkul nayaa bana vyikt diya
 Today, people often ask me, "where did you leave the rest of you?" They don't realize how close they are to the truth
 main teen ankon vaale vajan se 58 kilo par ai
 i have lost 45 kg and the count continues
 main un chizon par hairaan hum jo choti or dubli ho gai hai
 They are all easily visible parts of the body - stomach, hip, thighs; Hard parts like hands and calves; And more often the upper part of the body
 iske baad kam numaayan hone vaale ang hai, jaise-gardan, ungliyaan, pair
 i am ten points shorter in terms of dress size, from size 18 to size 8
 maine duusare angon main bhi vajan kam kiya he, un hisson se, jahaan charbi jamaa ho jaati he or aapako pataa bhi nahin chalata
 Fat is among those who kill without making a sound, it gathers around you, making you sluggish, slow and useless
 charbi sankramak hoti he, lihaaja aapkaa dimag bhi apni dhar khone lagata he
 He too becomes dull like the body in which he lives
 meraa dimag chust he or chaukanna he or main bahut saare kaam kar sakane vaali devi hum
 What is that borderline when you realize that you are capable of fighting greed? When you get out of the house, and do not blindly return after eating and drinking? It is a complex equation of your basic weight, target weight and willpower
 lekin main aasaani se kah sakati hum ki baaji palatney ke liye 5 se 7 kilo vajan kam kar lenaa kaaphi he
 And if your weight is 20 kg or even more than your ideal weight, then it is not very difficult to reduce 5 kg, but it is good in terms of weight loss
 or aap is kam kiye gaye vajan ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye prerit hai
 So, even when there is greed, your brain gives you other advice and you are able to stop greed
 to, main socialise kaise hoti thi?sach to yah he ki main hoti hi nahin thi, apni pahal par to nahin
 It was very difficult for me to get out at night
 ek, kyonki dinar kii yojana kaa matlab hota tha ki main teble par baithkar dit coke piti rahuungi or baaki logon ko daavat udaate dekhati rahuungi
 Although it made me feel better than others, i had to clean my entire diet, which led to guilt among others
 cocktail partiyon main drinks or snacks bahut zyada lalachaate the
 Just a battered prawn dipped in sweet chili sauce, a crispy springing roll, a tandoori cheese, a slice of California sushi and that's all
 mere shuhar mujhe itnaa pyaar karte the ki ve mujhe baahar jane ke liye majaboor nahin karte the
 He never insisted that i have dinner with him
 main bechaari maheenon tak akele khaanaa khaati rahi
 But i can also imagine him, the changes were encouraging because he did not want his 100 kg wife back
 unhone kabhi jor nahin daalaa ki main vajan kam karun, kyonki iskaa ant jhgade main nikalataa tha, lekin unhone saporting bhoomika auskar puraskaar laayak dhang se adaa kii
 For two months i did not get out at night
 main itnaa bharaa pet mahasoos karti thi ki mujhe khaane kaa laalach nahin hota tha
 Truth be told, the no-dinner rule of dieting is arguably stricter, as most times around socializing diners
 or laalach se bachane kaa sabase acha tarika he ki usase dur rahaa jaae
 You have to pay the price
 or chukaane ke lihaaj se yah ek choti-si keemat he
 i started meeting friends over coffee instead
 mujhe chah baje coffee pine kii ijaajat thi
 He used to be my dinner
 isane bakhubi kaam kiya
 i allowed myself to go to diners and parties only when my mind became stronger, my stomach became smaller and my wardrobe became more attractive
 jab ek baar sharir nae routine main ram jaataa he, to aapkaa kam ho chukaa vajan aapako dhokhaa na dene ke liye prerit or protsaahit karata he
 Instead of tasting everything your mind, body, soul get caught in the control of looking good
 jab maine behatar dikhnaa or mahasoos karnaa shuru kiya to mujhe baahar janaa acha lagane laga
 My plan was to have less of dinner and more of showing my new dress
 main ek gilaas shampen yaa white wine piti thi or kisi or cheez ke liye apana munh nahin kholti thi
 Not even tasting the world's best dishes
 kabhi-kabhi main der se ghar lautati thi or fal yaa dahi khaati thi
 Once i broke the eating pattern late at night, in the morning i felt quite good
 main tarotaaja or bhukhi thi or kasarat karne or naashtaa karne ke liye taiyaar thi
 i always felt lethargic, nauseous, and did not feel hungry for breakfast when i slept late and fiercely after dinner
 xxrep 5 * bahan kii shaadi apana vajan kam karne kii bahut badhiya vajah he
 The wedding was two months later and i felt that my body was not ready to accept a weight of less than 80 kg
 main kam karte-karte 75 kilo tak pahunchi or phir 79 kilo par laut gai
 Everyone used to tell me how good i look
 pehle to maine un par vishwaas kar liya, isse or vajan kam karne kii prerana kamjor pad gai
 But when i saw the photos, i came to know that they were all lying
 yaa ho saktaa he, unhone na bolaa ho
 His praise was comparative
 ''tum pehle jaisi thim, uski tulana main ab bahut acchhee lag rahi ho
 "it was no longer enough for me
" main aisi tarif chaahati thi, jisamen kisi se tulana na ho
 There was a wedding, dinner and champagne fair
 duulhaa-dulhan ke honeymoon se laut aane ke bhi kai hafte baad tak party chalati rahi or isi tarah khaane ke saath meri dosti chalati rahi
 During this time, the scale was again shifting to 80
 phir vahi 4 kilo
 i had run the race from 75 to 79 almost four times and it started coming
 mere paariwarik doctor kaa kahana tha ki meraa sharir uske ausat vajan par he
 Everyone has an average weight and mine was 79 to 80 kg
 main ise swikaarne ke liye taiyaar nahin thi
 i saw it as a dull stop
 sharir ko nae vajan ke saath talmail baitaane ke liye vakt chahie tha, kyonki main bahut jabardast badlaav kii maang kar rahi thi
 Luckily for me, one marriage was not enough and my sister was getting remarried
 usee shaks se
 The wedding was to be Christian in France within five months
 jahaan moti deh ko chhipaane ke liye koi anaarakaliyaan yaa saadiyaan nahin hongi, balki unhen jataane vaali chust poshaaken hongi
 i needed to lose more weight and i had to do it faster
 french shaadi ke liye main apana vajan 60 se 70 kilo ke bich rakhana chaahati thi
 Even 69
 5 kilo bhi chalegaa
 i wanted to change the entire image
 meri mekaover team (diaticiuns, trainurs or diziners) bhi utane hi josh main the, jitani main

 bihar main kai saptaah se chali aa rahi raajnneetik anischitata samaapt karte hue nitish kumaar 22 farvari ko rajya ke mukhyamantri ke rup main shapath lenge
 After an hour-long meeting with Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi at Raj Bhavan, Kumar told reporters that he would take oath as the Chief Minister of Bihar on February 22 at five in the evening
 unhone bataaya ki rajyapal ne unase 16 march se pehle teen saptaah ke bheetar sadan main bahumat siddh karne ko kaha he
 Along with Nitish, an independent MLA including JDU, RJD, Congress and CPI mlas also went to meet the Governor
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki unki sarkaar bihar vidhansabha ke nae bajet satr ko bulaane ke bare main faisla karegi or rajyapal ke bihar vidhaan mandal ke sanyukt satr main die jane vaale abhibhaashan kii tithi tay karegi
 Nitish Kumar said that JDU and its supporters had submitted a claim to form the government in Bihar on February 8 and on 9 February when they and other leaders had gone to meet the Governor, the claim was reiterated
 rajbhavan se nikalate samay nitish ne patrakaron se kaha, ‘‘aaj hamane apane daawey ko pun: doharaaya or kaha ki aaj kii paristhiti main ham ek baar phir nayi sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karte hai

 Badal said in a statement in Chandigarh, 'there is absolutely no water to be left in SYL and not a single drop of water can be allowed to flow in SYL, no one will be allowed to do it
 ' The Chief Minister said that political parties and leaders of Punjab and Haryana should not fall in the way of cheap popularity at the cost of peace and stability in the state
 tippaniyan Badal's statement came after Abhay Chautala, the leader of the opposition Indian National Lok Dal from Haryana, announced that his party workers for the syl's excavation work on February 23 to ensure rapid implementation of the recent verdict of the apex court Will gather in Ambala and travel towards Punjab

 Uddhav Thackeray took oath in Marathi language: All leaders of Congress, NCP, Shiv Sena present Thackeray government has started in Maharashtra
 guuruuvaar ko shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne mumbai ke aitihaasik shivaji park main mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee
 With the oath, Uddhav Thackeray became the first member of the Thackeray family to sit on the Chief Minister's chair
 shapath grahan samaaroh main congress, ensipi or shivasena ke tamaam bade netaa maujuud rahe
 cms of many states also reached the ceremony
 isamen maharashtra navnirmaan sena ke pramukh raaj thakare ne bhi shirkat kii
 Uddhav took oath in Marathi language to pay homage to Shivajimaharaja and Vethakare is the first Chief Minister of the family
 uddhav ke baad cabinet ke anya mantriyon ko shapath dilaai ja rahi he
 After Uddhav Thackeray, Shivnath's Eknath Shinde, Subhash Desai were sworn in as ministers
 iske badencipicote se vidhayak dal ke netaa jayant patil or chagan bhujabal ko shapath dilaai gai
 Read here the moment-by-moment news of the Government of Maharashtra, Uddhav, the son of Bal Thackeray, who laid the foundation of Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, was born on July 27, 1960 in Bombay
 unki shuruaati shiksha balamohan vidya mandir se hui
 He then pursued higher education from the Sir JJ Institute of Applied Art
 uddhav thakare kaa siyaasi kariyarshivsena kii neenv 1966 main uddhav ke pitaabala sahib thakrene rakhi thi
 As long as Balasaheb Thackeray remained active in politics, Uddhav remained almost away from the political scene or was seen standing behind him
 haalanki uddhav party kii kaman sanbhaalane se pehle shivasena ke akhbaar saamana kaa kaam dekhte the or uske sampadak bhi rahe
 However, later, due to Bal Thackeray's growing age and ill health, he started looking after the party's functioning after 2000
 2003 main mili badi jimmedaarisal 2002 main brihanmumbai municipal corporation (biemasi) ke chunaavon main shivasena ko joardaar safalataa mili or iskaa shrey uddhav thakare ko diya gaya
 Bal Thackeray then handed over his political legacy to Uddhav
 janvari 2003 main uddhav ko shivasena kaa kaaryakari adhyaksh bana diya gaya
 The low-profile Uddhav Thackeray was surprised when Bal Thackeray was chosen as the successor to the Shiv Sena, as many outside the party did not even know his name and Raj Thackeray was known as a possible successor
 par bal thakare ke apane bete uddhav ko uttaradhikari chune se aahat raaj thakare ne 2006 main party chhod di or nai party- maharashtra navnirmaan sena kaa gathan kiya
 Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh said on Thursday that the government is constantly engaged in persuading the cement companies to reduce the price of cement
 vidhansabha main prashnkaal ke dauraan vipakshi dal bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) dwaara lagaae gaye aarope ke jawaab main singh ne kaha, 'iske liye sarkaar dwaara gathit udyog mantri kii adhyakshata vaali ek cameti kaam kar rahi he
 He said that it is a serious matter that despite the production of cement in Himachal, it is worth more here than in other states
 khaadya evam naagarik aapurti mantri ji
 s
 bali dwaara vipaksh ke sawaalon kaa spasht jawaab na dene ke baad mukhyamantri singh ne isamen apana hastkshep kiya
 The state has four mega plants for cement production, including ACC at Baramana, Ambuja at Durlaghat, CCI at Rajban and AAPI Himachal Cement Limited companies at Bagha
 inaki prati vaarshik cement utpaadan kshamta takreeban ek karod ton se bhi zyada he
 The first parliamentary session of the Modi government has been very important in terms of government business
 lagaataar duusari baar satta main aane ke baad apane pehle hi satr main sarkaar ke saamne vipaksh kii ek na chali or kai atake pade vidheyakon ko paas kiya gaya
 This time the BJP reached the Lok Sabha with 303 mps, with 353 mps including the NDA mps with the government
 vahiin mukhya vipakshi dal congress apane saathi dalon ko bhi lamaband kar paane main vifal rahi
 In the 17th Lok Sabha with a strong majority, there was a lot of work and the stuck bills like Jammu and Kashmir reorganization, triple talaq, motor vehicle, NIA amendment also became law in a jolt
 sadan main in vidheyakon par charchaa hui, vaad-vivaad bhi hua lekin vipakshi dalon kii ore se kii gai maangon ko sarkaar ne nahin mana
 Opposition parties, including Congress and TMC, were adamant on demanding the bill to be referred to the Parliamentary Committee but no bill was sent to the committee for scrutiny
 khub kaam, nahin hua vyavadhanaloksabhaa spikar ne is satr ko svarnim satr bataate hue kaha ki is baar sadan main koi vyavdhaan hi nahin hua, yah apane aap main ek record he
 In the first session, the proceedings of the Lok Sabha were not adjourned for the entire session due to an uproar
 saath hi loksabhaa se 36 bill paas hue or 280 ghante tak vibhinn muddon par charchaa ke liye sadan kii kaarywahi chali
 Many occasions came when the discussion continued in the Lok Sabha till 12 o'clock at night
 saath hi loksabhaa main roj ausatan saadhe saat ghante kaam hua
 In the first session of the first Lok Sabha in 1952, 25 Bills were passed
 lekin is baar 17veen loksabhaa ke pehle satr main 36 bill paas hue hai
 In the first session of the 11th, 14th and 15th Lok Sabha including the previous Lok Sabha, no bill was passed by the House
 is loksabhaa main pehali baar chun kar aae zyaadaatar saansadon ne pehle hi satr main prashn kaal yaa shunya kaal ke dauraan apni baat rakhane kaa mauka diya gaya
 Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla had made it clear in the House that what had happened earlier would not happen now
 unhone kaha tha ki yah sadan hangaame kii vajah se sthagit nahin kiya jayega
 The speaker helped the government to run the house smoothly, not only did the government get an overwhelming majority, but the Opposition was also able to support the Speaker's business by agreeing to speak with the speaker
 desh main chalegaa BJP kaa agenda?modi sarkaar ne is baar aise vidheyakon ko sansad kii manjuuri dilaai he jo kaaphi lambey vakt se bijepi kaa agenda rahe hai
 The most important of these is the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Bill which divides Kashmir into 2 parts
 jansangh se samay se hi kashmir se anuchhed 370 hataanaa bijepi kaa pramukh agenda rahaa he
 This time the government also passed this resolution from the House
 ab jammu kashmir or ladakh do alag-alag centre shasit pradesh honge, saath hi kashmir se 370 hatane ke baad vahaan desh ke kai kanoon or samvidhan sanshodhan lagu ho jaaenge
 The BJP has been advocating the triple talaq bill even before it came to power in 2014
 is bill ko pichhali baar loksabhaa se paarit hone ke baad rajyasabha main roak diya tha
 But this time this bill was passed by both the houses
 ab desh main teen talaak gaiyr kanoonee or isamen 3 saal kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan shaamil kar aparaadh banaaya gaya he
 Even more in front
 
 
 sarkaar ne loksabhaa main aisa daanv khelaa he ki ab sansad se bijepi kaa agenda rahe uniform civil code or ram mandir nirmaan sambandhi kanoonon ke paas hone kii sugabugahat tej ho gai he
 Following the slogan of One Country, One Legislative and One Head, BJP can also pass the same Civil Code in the country in the coming days from the Parliament and this time the bjp's top leaders have also indicated it
 modi sarkaar ke satr kii shuruyaat jaisi rahi he usase aage kii raah kaa andaja lagaana mushkil nahin he
 The BJP will try to pass all the laws which are an important part of the party's ideology on the strength of the overwhelming majority
 haalanki satr bhar vipaksh sarkaar par vidheyakon ko thopane or sansad ke apmaan kaa aarope lagaataa rahaa lekin sankhyabal agle 5 saal tak uske paksh main nahin he

 loksabhaa main mangalvaar ko anti rape bill pesh karne se thik ek din pehle is mudde par somvaar kii subah jahaan sarvadaleey baithak hui, vahiin somvaar kii shaam ko mantrimandal ne bhi baithak kar anti rape bill par vistaar se charchaa kii
 In the cabinet meeting, the government gave its approval to increase the minimum age for consensual sex to 18 years
 sutron ne somvaar ko yah jaankaree di
 a social worker said that this provision of the bill could have been misused
 sarvadaleey baithak main sahmati kii umr par sarvasammati ban jane ke baad ek aadhikarik sutara ne bataaya, ‘18 varsh se kam umr kii ladki ke saath sahmati se banaae gaye shaareerik sambandh ko 'balaatkaar' mana jayega
 According to sources, a minor child who has committed a sexual offense will have to undergo one year of probation as a punishment for the first offense, but on the second offense committing a similar offense, he will be booked for 'rape'
 akhil bhartiya pragatisheel mahila sangh kii adhyaksh kavita krishnan ne kaha ki aapraadhik kanoon (sanshodhan) vidheyak-2013 ke is praavdhaan kaa durupyog kiya ja saktaa tha
 Kavita said, "in an all-party meeting, it was clearly decided that the age of consent would be 18 years but for the first time a minor child would undergo probation if the consensual relationship was made
 suraksha kii drushti se yah ekadam aparyaapt he, chunki koi bhi teesraa vyakti jaise unke parijan yaa khap panchayatein, us par probeshan ke ulanghan kaa aarope laga sakati hai or use 'balaatkaar' ke aparaadh main sajaa dilava sakati hai
 Kavita, who is fighting for women's rights, said that the provision of allowing the age of consent to be 18 years can be used against the scheduled class
 unhone kaha, ‘sahmati kii umr se kam umr main sahmati se sambandh banane ko nyaayik prakriya ke tahat bachaav ke liye upyog nahin kiya ja saktaa
 If it is made 18, the youth, especially the Scheduled Castes, can be held guilty of 'rape' even for consensual relations
 ’supreme court ke ek vakil ke anusaar sahmati kii umr par vivaad pichley varsh may main tab shuru hua jab bhartiya dand samhita main sahmati kii umr ko 16 varsh se badhaakar bal yon aparaadh sangrakshan adhinium-2012 main 18 varsh kar diya gaya
 He says that now the government should take a final decision
 sutron ne kaha ki loksabhaa main vidheyak pesh karne ke saath hi sarkaar is mudde par sanshodhan prastaav laaegi
 The bill also provides for the death penalty in the rarest case of 'rape' and in the case of repeated acts
 is vidheyak kaa praaroop taiyaar karne main nyaayamurti je
 s
 verma dwaara dushkarm rodhi vidheyak ko sakht banane ke liye die gaye siforeeshon ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya he
 This anti-rape bill will be replaced by an ordinance enacted by President Pranab Mukherjee on February 3

 madhya pradesh ke gwalior or jabalpur sambhag main haalia saalon main ganne kii paidaavaar or uskaa utpaadan shuru hua he
 Arun Khandelwal, national president of the Federation of Gur Traders, says, "specialist sugarcane farmers in western Uttar Pradesh have moved to Madhya Pradesh in large numbers and have adopted sugarcane cultivation in Narsinghpur district of Jabalpur division and They have set up jaggery manufacturing units there
 ''is ilaake main chini milen na hone se gud kaa utpaadan bina kisi pratidwandita ke ho rahaa he
 As a result, the jaggery business in Western Uttar Pradesh is beginning to get affected
 khandelwal bataate hai ki maharashtra ke puna jile main mujffarnagar ke barla or saharanpur ke devband kshetra ke gopali or rajupur gaanvon ke kisaanon or gud nirmaataaon ne vahaan gud kii 90 ikaiyaan sthapit kar lee hai
 The effect of this change was that the provinces of eastern India like Orissa, Assam and West Bengal, etc
, which supplied jaggery from western Uttar Pradesh, have now been badly affected
 bhartiya upmahadweep ke vyanjanon kaa lokapriy hissaa maane jane vaale gud kaa sabase zyada utpaadan abhi bhi pashchimi uttar pradesh main hota he
 Asia's largest jaggery market is located in Muzaffarnagar, the prosperous district of the region
 ganna utpaadakon ke alaava yahaan paanch lakh log gud vyavsaay se sidhe jude hue hai
 In 1990, 23 per cent of the sugarcane production was used in sugar mills, 13 per cent Khandasari, 10 per cent seeds and juice and the remaining 54-55 per cent was used to make jaggery on crushers
 ab haalat yah he ki khandsari udyog puri tarah se khatm ho gaya he or chini milon kii sankhya or unki perai kshamta main jabardast ijapha ho jane se ganne kaa bada hissaa chini udyog kii ore chalaa gaya he
 At present, the sugar industry is getting 60 to 65 per cent of the total sugarcane production, while its supply to jaggery units has come down drastically
 lekin jab bazaar main gud ke daam badhate hai to chini milon ko ganne kii supplai or unki perai buree tarah ladkadaa jaati he
 Crusher owners give a tough competition to sugar mills in terms of sugarcane price
 kolhuon par kai baar ganne kaa bhav chini milon se bhi zyada ho jaataa he
 In such a situation, the sugarcane supply of sugar mills is affected and 30-40% of the sugarcane crushers start going
 pashchimi uttar pradesh main sabase zyada ganna paidaa karne vaale saharanpur or mujffarnagar jilon main kolhuon par 40-45 fisadi ganna pahunchataa he jabaki duusari jagahon par yah 25-30 fisadi rahata he
 However, since the crusher's rivalry with the sugar mills, they have found unique ways to make profit
 masalan, unhone khoi kaa eendhan ke rup main istemaal band kar diya he
 They sell it to paper mills at high prices
 or kolhu main vaikalpik eendhan ke rup main polithin ke kachare, popeler tathaa eukilipistas kii chhijan kaa istemaal karne lage hai
 Due to this they are financially strong, their durability capacity also increases
 aisi haalat main kabhi-kabhi ve kisaanon ko chini milon se bhi zyada ganne ke bhav dene kii haalat main aa jate hai
 "over time, crusher operators are becoming smarter," says engineer Anil Tanwar, president of Triveni Sugar Group
 ''sarkaar ko bhi kuch rajasav gud se miltaa he
 Jaggery production in the state attracts two and a half per cent mandi duty whereas in states like Bihar and Delhi, there is no duty on it
 anya rajyon main gud par ek se dedh fisadi tak hi mandi shulk he
 Khandelwal said, "in the larger public interest, Chief Minister Mayawati should completely abolish the mandi duty on jaggery
 aisa nahin to use ghataakar ek fisadi kar den
 "this will not only curb the black marketing of jaggery, but will also reduce the cloud of crisis looming over his business

 chauthaa vachan:'man main rakhana drudh vishwaas, kare samadhi puri aas

 Seeing that the hot seat was clear in Haridwar and Almora Uttarakhand, the Congress changed its leadership at the last moment and instead of Vijay Bahuguna, handed over the command of Chief Minister to Harish Rawat on the condition that they at least will not let the condition of the Congress be the same as the bjp's

 Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan has proposed to build a new building for the Parliament House in the country
 unka kahana he ki vartmaan 88 saal puraani imaarat par samay or badhati umr kaa asar dikhne laga he or yah adhik jagah kii badhati maang ko puraa karne main ab sakasham nahin he
 The speaker suggests two alternative sites for this
 inamen eksansad bhawan parisaramen hi or doosraa nikat hi rajpath ke us sthaan par jahaan raksha or dilli police ke kuch barrack sthit hai
 Mahajan has also written a letter to Urban Development Minister m Venkaiah Naidu about this
 isamen nae sansad bhawan parisar ke nirmaan ke kaary ko shuru karne par vichaar karne ko kaha gaya he
 Why is the need for a new parliament building Justifying the need for a new building for Parliament, Sumitra Mahajan said that when the current building was taken into service in 1927, the number of employees, security personnel, media, people visiting Parliament was limited
 Was, but the number of people visiting here has increased manifold over the years
 venkaiya naidu ko likhe patr main sumitra mahajan ne kaha, 'sansad ke vartmaan bhawan kii umr or kaaryon va karmchaariyon kii sankhya badhane or uske jyaad istemaal kii vajah se is par asar pad rahaa he
 He also said that the present house of Parliament has become 88 years old
 kaamkaaj badha, aage bad sakati hai loksabhaa sitenloksabhaa adhyaksh ne kaha ki pehle yah bhawan sirfasaansdonor sachivalay ke karmchaariyon ke liye tha, lekin sansadeey kaamkaaj badhane, samitiyon or suraksha jarurate badhane ke kaaran jagah kii maang kai guna bad gai he
 The Speaker has also said that the Parliament building has been declared as 'heritage Site Grade-1', so there are many limitations in its structure repair, expansion, alteration and alteration
 unhone kaha ki saal 2026 ke baad loksabhaa ke siton kii sankhya badhane kii sambhaavna he or yah samvidhan ke anuchhed 81 ke upbandh 3 ke tahat ho saktaa he
 Currently the seating capacity in the Lok Sabha is 550 seats and cannot be increased
 apni chitthee main loksabhaa adhyaksh ne likhaa he ki agar sansad bhawan ke kendriya kaksh ko bhi loksabhaa chambar ke rup main badla jaae, tab bhi 550 sadasyon se adhik isamen nahin aa sakenge
 Currently, the central hall has a capacity of 398 seats
 nai technology se jodne kii jaruratloksabhaa adhyaksh ne kaha ki praudyogiki ke unnat hone ke saath aisi yojana he ki saansadon ko atyaadhunik upkarnon se las kiya jaae or sansad ko kagaji karrwai se mukt kiya jaae
 He said that due to this, the system of meeting in the Lok Sabha Chamber will need to be redesigned
 chambar main vartmaan baithne kii vyavastha kii simaaen hai, nai imaarat se atyaadhunik praudyogiki se las aadhunik sansad kaa vikalp pesh hoga
 Suggesting the addition of an old building to the underground, the speaker wrote, "in these circumstances a new state-of-the-art building of Parliament is needed
 ' sumitra mahajan ne likhaa ki nae sansad bhawan ke nirmaan kaa ek vikalp parisar ke andar hi hoga or doosraa rajpath ke duusari ore ho saktaa he jo upyukt rup se bada kshetra he or jahaan nae parisar kaa dizin taiyaar karne kii swatantraaa ho sakati he
 Both the existing building and the proposed new building complexes have also been suggested to be connected by underground

 Praising Adityanath, Sadhvi said that the way the present government of UP is investigating the works of the previous government, their truth will soon be revealed to the people
 upi main sharabbandi chaahati hai sadhvisadhvi praachi ne kaha kiyogi sarkaarake kaamkaaj se unki (samaajawaadee party) raaton kii neend kharaab ho gai hogi

 Some states have reduced VAT on oil by losing one rupee per liter
 
 And how much more this will increase depends on the Iran crisis

 In such a situation, the Prime Minister's promise of giving better MSP and the intention of doubling the income of the farmers can turn water again
 
 Not only this, what has been said by the Reserve Bank about demonetisation, there is a question mark on the government's move
