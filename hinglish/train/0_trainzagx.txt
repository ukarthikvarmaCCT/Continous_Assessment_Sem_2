 Then Mann Ki Baat, now intensifying the attack on the silent Prime Minister and his government, Sonia Gandhi further said, 'on one hand the Prime Minister claims high morality

 In such a situation, the doctor intestine is taken out for some time to save life, it is called colostomy

 Till then the intestine remains outside the stomach

 com dwitiya varsh kaa chaatr 21 varshiya pamesh prasad ranchi ke lower bazaar police thane main dinesh prajapati ke khilaaf shikaayat darj karwaata he
 Prajapati owns a local coaching institute called Digdarshan Institute
 shikaayat main us par aarope lagaaya jaataa he ki usne pamesh se ardhsainik bal main bhartee karne kaa vaada karke use thag liya
 Prasad claims that Prajapati paid him two lakhs in May 2012
 lekar apane ek dost ravi bodara se milwaaya
 Bodra is said to have been an informer in the Military Intelligence Department
 prasad kaa aarope tha ki bodara ne use kendriya rigerv police bal (siarpief) main ''aatmasamarpan niti'' ke tahat milane vaali naukariyon kii jaankaree di
 All he had to do to get a job was surrender himself to the CRPF by declaring himself a Naxalite, for which Bodra would do the job of providing weapons
 iske baad use kuch maheene jail main bitaane padate jiske baad use sudhare hue charampanthi ke rup main kendriya bal main bhartee mil jaati
 Prasad trusted this and was imprisoned in the camp of the state-of-the-art Cobra Battalion of the CRPF at the old jail complex in Ranchi
 is ''khuli jail'' main prasad kii tarah hi saikadon anya yuva kaid the jinamein adhiktar adivasee the
 All the prisoners were spending their lives here in the hope that one day they will rise above their bad existence and wear uniforms and make up their lives
 lekin vaade ke mutabik naukari nahin milane kii sambhaavna ke maddenjar vah ''khuli jail'' se bhaag gaya
 After that, a senior CRPF officer had feared something wrong and thought of ending it
 jin logon ne use dhokhaa diya tha, unhen sabak sikhaane kii prasad kii koshishen kahin do saal baad jaakar kaamyaab huin, jab tatkaaleen adivasee mukhyamantri ne rajya kii adiyal police ko aisi shikayaton kii jaanch karne ke liye kisi tarah raji kar liya
 April 6, 2014: The Jharkhand Police detained Bodra and recorded his confession at the same Lower Bazaar police station
 usne sweekaar kiya ki usne aatmasamarpan karwaane main madhyasth kii bhoomika nibhaai thi or vah apane parichit varisht police adhikariyon tathaa siarpief ke afasaron ke nirdesh par kaam kar rahaa tha
 Bodra was arrested, Prajapati surrendered in court and a charge sheet was filed in the case in May 2014
 tab jharkhand ke mukhyamantri hemanth sorain ne is maamle main sibiai jaanch kii maang kii
 After this the silence subsided
 kisi bhi pulisavaale yaa siarpief ke jawan yaa adhikari se poochtacha nahin kii gai
 There was no investigation as to where Bodra brought the weapons, as stated by the surrenders
 usne logon ko thag kar jo paisa banaaya, uski bhi jaanch nahin hui
 The demand for CBI investigation has become just a demand
 is chuppi main jharkhand ke 514 abhaage yuvakon kii jindagi kii kahani chhipi he jinamein se adhiktar garib adivasee hai
 There is no talk of breaking the law in their past
 bodara ko paise dene ke liye inhone udhaar maanga, apane parivaar se paise liye, jameen girvee rakhi, naksali hone kaa thappa apane upar lagavaaya or kareeb do saal tak ranchi ke puraane jail parisar main kaid rahe-in sabhi ko yah ummid thi ki iske baad inhen siarpief main ek sipaahi kii maamuli-si naukari mil jaaegi, ye bhi vardi pahan sakenge or is tarah jharkhand ke kuch sarvaadhik pichde ilaakon kii badahaali se mukt ho sakenge
 At the same time, this story is also about those middlemen who grew up overnight and colluded with the corrupt elements sitting in the establishment and blatantly mocked the national security for name and price

 maamla duuri kaa nahin, donon jagahon ke fark kaa he jo bataata he ki kujur ke jivan main pichley teen saal main kitne utaar-chadhaav aae hai

 There he came to know that like him there are 500 more people, mostly from Ranchi and neighboring Khunti and Gumla districts

 The amount was raised with the expectation that the CRPF and maybe even the Jharkhand Police would run a "direct recruitment" scheme in which jobs would be given only to surrendered Naxals

 They could go to their village whenever they wanted and sometimes CRPF car used to leave them at home

 This led to more youths pulling towards the camps

 padbhaar grahan karne ke maheene bhar ke bheetar raav ne jharkhand ke tatkaaleen police pramukh ji
 s
 rath ko likhte hue sawaal uthaaya ki 514 vyaktiyon ko ranchi kii puraani jail main kyon rakhaa gaya he jo siarpief kaa shivi he
 a copy of the letter Rao wrote on 3 October 2012 is with India Today (see image)
 unhone likhaa tha, ''jail parisar ke apane daure main yah mere sangyaan main aayaa he ki in kathith 514 aatmasamarpit naksaliyon main se kuch ke hi khilaaf vaastavik mukademe hai
 The rest seems to have been brought here without investigating their involvement in Naxal activities
 isiilie naksal gatividhiyon main inaki sanliptata ko cese dar cese jaanchana hoga varanaa isaki puri sambhaavna he ki kuch aniatik tatv nirdosh-maamuli aparaadhiyon se farji aatmasamarpan karvaa kar sarender nitiyon ke tahat laabh par daawa karne kii koshish karke sthiti kaa dohan kar rahe hai
 In this letter, Rao also said that the surrender policy is a matter of the state government and not a paramilitary force like the CRPF, hence the CRPF should focus on counter-emergency operations only
 yah patr is maamle main chaunkaane vaala he ki yah na sirf bodara or siarpief kii mileebhagat se chalaae ja rahe mahaj ek racket kii ore ishaara karata he balki farji naksaliyon ke aatmasamarpan kii juthi kahani ko gadhane main jharkhand police or siarpief ke bich ek sambhavit santhganth par bhi ungali uthaata he
 The end of the dream: The fake Naxalites surrender scam in Jharkhand was an employment scam created by some elements of CRPF and Jharkhand Police but it came to light? a senior IPS officer of Jharkhand, who keeps a close watch on the matter, believes so
 us adhikari ne bataaya, ''ve nishchit taur par sarender ke aankadon ko badhaakar grih mantralay ke apane varishton kii saraahna paane kii koshish main lage honge
 It was a fraud done with innocent youth, it is clear
 kendriya ardhsainik bal aatmasamarpan kar chuke charampanthiyon ko rojgaar nahin de sakate
 Apart from this, CRPF or any paramilitary force cannot accept surrender even in the event of non-operation
 ''ve kehete hai, ''siarpief ke inspector general ke bataur raav jab chaahate, in logon ko cobra batalian ke shivi se baahar kar sakate the, lekin unhone apni chintaa jaahir karne ke liye jharkhand ke dijipi ko patr bhejnaa uchit samajha
 This simply means that they needed the Jharkhand Police's approval to expel these boys

 Shashibhushan Pathak of People's Union for Civil Liberties, Jharkhand, says, "we have reason to believe that top officials of the CRPF and State Police planned an event to surrender more than 500 Maoists to the Union Home Ministry
" was
 chunki ve asli maovadiyon kaa intjaam nahin kar paae, lihaaja inhone nirdosh adivaasiyon ko fansaakar unke haathon main bandook thama di or unke upar vampanthi charampanthi hone kaa thappa laga diya
 Kujur, who was among such youth, supports this claim
 ve kehete hai ki unhen bataaya gaya tha ki unke liye ek bhavy aatmasamarpan kaarykram kaa aayojan kiya jayega
 The effect of Rao's letter was to happen
 jharkhand ke grih vibhaag ne cobra ke camp main kaid 514 logon ke record jaanchane kaa aadesh de daalaa! yah paaya gaya ki inamen se sirf chah ke kisi-na-kisi tarah maovadiyon se sambandh the or jinhen sarender niti ke tahat laabh ke yogya mana ja saktaa tha
 The remaining 508 people were asked to leave the camp
 ranchi police ne jab pamesh prasad kii shikaayat darj kii or hemanth sorain ne sibiai jaanch kii maang kii, uske baad rajya sarkaar ne vidhansabha main sweekaar kiya ki 514 yuvaaon ke saath thagi hui he
 Soren told India Today, "A fraud occurred with innocent youth of Jharkhand
" ek exiar darj kii gai, lekin chunki isamen kuch ardhsainik bal ke adhikariyon kii bhi mileebhagat kii ore ishaara ho rahaa tha lihaaja maine mukhyamantri rahete hue pichhali may main sibiai jaanch kii sifarish kar daali
 Now i am being told that the CBI is reluctant to carry out this investigation
 is maamle main gahan padtaal kii tatkaal aavashyaktaa he
 Since then, the continued silence on the matter has given rise to fresh apprehensions

 He says, "they have caught the pieces but they have done nothing to catch the top officers without whom this surrender scam could not have been possible
" ''yah tathy ki sarender ko asli dikhaane ke liye yuvaaon ko hathiyaar uplabdh karaae gaye, ek or gambhir sawaal khadaa karata he
 "it means that at least 514 guns and a few thousand cartridges were arranged," says Rajiv Kumar

 After investigating the case for several weeks, when India Today approached the CRPF and Jharkhand Police officials to get an opinion on it, in response, at least they did not blame the other's head
 Kept himself away from this scandal

 "this is a demand that hardly anyone expects will be met, unless there is a court intervention or the central government intervenes in this matter

 The task of lifting the brick in the kiln should no longer be done by people like Kujur but those forces whose responsibility is to fight the Naxalites
 jaisaa ki ham sabhi jaanate hai ki film 'ab tak chappan-2' ek sikval film he or kahani ird gird gumti he encounter specialist sadhu agashe ke ird gird jo prerit he dayaa nike se
 In this film too, Sadhu Agashe has been called back to the Force again to control the deteriorating situation and then begins the encounter of Sadhu Agashe
 film 'ab tak chappan-2' se stantman ejaz gulab nirdesan kii duniyaan main kadam rakh rahe hai
 Apart from the encounter in the film, conspiracy and Emotion of Sadhu Agashe have also been shown
 pehali film kii tarah sadhu vaisaa hi chust he or vaise hi encounter squad main thodaa hansi mazaaq he jo film ko baari hone se bachaata he, bas farq sirf ye he ki thode kalakaaron ke chehre badal gaye hai, sadhu agashe thode buudhe ho gaye hai or gangster kii paribhaasha thodi badali hui dikhaai he
 The gangster in this film is not just Jahil or illiterate but educated people

 The entertainment in this film is also good and the climax is excellent
 lekin agar pehali 'ab tak chappan' se barabari karen to ye film kamazor he

 The Supreme Court has convicted Sasikala, who is being claimed as the CM candidate in Tamil Nadu in a disproportionate assets case
 court ne shashikala or unke do rishtedaaron ko chaar saal kaid kii sajaa bhi sunai he
 Sasikala has also been fined Rs 10 crore
 shashikala par supreme court kaa faisla 570 pej kaa he
 The court said that the High Court did not separately examine the income tax related documents scrutinized by the trial court but only looked into the documents of the defense income tax returns
 hoicourt is cese se jude ahm sabooton par gaur karne main naakaam rahaa
 Sasikala and others failed to prove that the property was acquired in a legal manner
 12 companiyon ke bank khaaton se jo lenden hua usase saaf he ki ye gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se kamaaya paisa tha1991 main in sabhi kii kul sampatti 2

 44 karod ho gai
 That means more than 64 crores
 hoicourt ne is maamle main aay se adhik sampatti ke liye ankaganit kii galat gananaa kii
 The trial court's verdict is true that action can be taken under the anti-corruption Act to incite a common person to crime
 doshiyon ne bainko main 50 acount khulwaaye or bade paimaane par behisaab paisa jamaa karavaaya, ye sab paisa bhejne kaa ek hi centre tha - 36 paayas garden, chennaitrial court kaa yah kahana bhi thik he ki doshiyon ne bade paimaane par kam keemat par vivaadit or logon par dabaav banaakar achal sampatti kharidi
 Many times government rules were violated and registry was prepared at the Chief Minister's residence itself
 shashikala jayalalita ke saath poyas garden main hi rahati thi taaki vah jaya kii sampati ko kabja saken
 Sasikala and two others got together and acquired a large amount of land from Jayalalithaa's fund, clearly indicating that the three were a conspiracy to grab Jaya's property, not for friendship philanthropy in Poyce Gardens
 bhale hi jayalalita ke khilaaf apil ko band kar diya gaya ho, lekin supreme court ne ek tarah is maamle main unhen doshi qaraar de diya he
 Has also imposed serious charges on Sasikala
 supreme court ne kaha he ki jayalalita, shashikala or do anya ne sajeesh rachi or aage jayalalita ne public survet hone ke tahat aay se adhik sampatti arjeet kii or shashikala va anya do ko bhi banti
 Transferring funds from Jayalalithaa's account to Sasikala's account proves that the four are collectively involved in the case
 is maamle main ye sweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki jayalalita is puure maamle se anjaan raheen
 Sasikala, Sudhakaran and Ilavarasi remained fully involved in this conspiracy and were engaged in legalizing Jaya's black money
 1991-1996 ke bich jayalalita ke mukhyamantri rahete samay aay se adhik 66 karod rupee kii sampatti arjeet karne ke maamle main sitambar 2014 main bengalooru kii special court ne jayalalita, shashikala or unke do rishtedaaron ko chaar saal kii sajaa or 100 karod rupee kaa jurmaana lagaaya tha
 In this case Sasishkala was convicted of abetment and conspiracy
 lekin may, 2015 main karnataka hoicourt ne jayalalita or shashikala samet sabhi ko bari kar diya tha
 After this, the Government of Karnataka, DMK and Subramanian Swamy challenged the High Court's order in the Supreme Court
 bharat ke liye ek acchhee khabar he
 India's position has improved 9 places in the latest list of Corruption Perception Index released by Transparency International, a corruption watchdog organization in countries around the world

 In the same index, India was ranked 94th among 177 countries last year
 itnaa hi nahin karpshan paracepshan index score main bhi 2014 main sudhaar dekha gaya he
 In 2013, this score was 36 which has now increased by 2 points to 38
 duniya bhar ke visheshgyon kii raay ke aadhaar par is karpshan paracepshan index score ko 0 (atyadhik bhrasht) se 100 (bahut saaf) ke bich diya jaataa he
 This report of Corruption Perception Index has also revealed a shocking picture, in this list no country got a perfect score whereas more than 50 percent of the countries got less than 50 marks
 is suchakank main pichley saal ke number van newjiland (91 ank) ko duusare number par dhakelte hue denmark (92 ank) top par pahunch gaya he
 The index, based on opns from experts around the world, shows the level of corruption in the public sector of various countries
 is report main saarvajanik kshetra ke bhrashtachar ke nattejey ke rup main ghoosekhori, khastahal skool, nakli davaaiyaan or chunaav main paison ke bolbaale ko nirupit kiya gaya he
 The report said that bribery not only steals resources but they also undermine justice and economic development as well as destroy public confidence in government and leaders
 transperency international kii is report ke anusaar, ‘bhrashtachar harek mulk kii samasya he
 a poor score in this index indicates widespread bribery in a country, reduced punishment for corruption, and public institutions not paying attention to the needs of citizens
 itnaa hi nahin is suchakank main sheersh par aae deshon ko bhi karrwai karne kii jarurat he
 The European Union and US financial centers need to engage with rapidly growing economies to curb corruption
 ’itnaa hi nahin, transperency international ne ji-20 mulkon se bhi kaale dhan or gopneey companiyon ko bhrashtachar par pardaa daalane se rokane kii ore kadam uthaakar apni vaishvik bhoomika nibhaane ko kaha

 In the case of lotteries, Pednault was double lucky because one of his tickets received a prize of 1 million Canadian dollars and second, he got it back just a few days before the validity expired

 Input - Language asprishyata kii samasya ko gaharaai se samajhane or samajhane vaale dow
 Bhimrao Ambedkar was the first leader
 unhone 1920 se 1956 ke bich apane bauddhik, saamaajik or rajnatik prayaason se asprishyata kii samasya ko pehali baar rashtriya mudda banaaya
 Then, in 1950 the Constitution made special provisions for the upliftment of Dalits
 kuch sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon ko nitiyon main badla gaya
 Ultimately, untouchability was banned in 1950
 1955 main asprishyata-virdohi kanoon or 1989 main utpeeda virdohi kanoon banaakar aise saamaajik bhedbhaav ke khilaaf kanoonee suraksha muhaiyaa karai gai
 Similarly, to provide protection against discrimination in employment and education, a policy of reservation has been formulated so that their economic and educational level can rise and these policies have been in the legislatures for more than sixty years
 isliye hamaare liye ye sawaal poochna lajimi ho jaataa he kiru kya jati-aadhaarit oonch-neech or chuaachhut ab itihaas kii baaten ban gai hai? kya daliton ne thos aarthik or shaikshik vikaas hasil kar liya he? kya unhen dusron ke baraabar naagarik adhikaar mil gaye hai? aakhir, civil sosayadi or daliton ke rajnatik prayaason se ab tak kya hasil hua he? agar 1950 se pehle kii sthiti par gaur karen to ham kah sakate hai ki unki aarthik or shaikshik sthiti main fark aayaa he
 There has also been progress on the discrimination and untouchability front
 lekin pragati kii raftaar ummid se bahut dhimi rahi he
 Dalits are still far behind the upper castes and the problem of poverty and caste discrimination continues to be stigmatized
 haalanki sarkari aankade or adhyayan bataate hai ki daliton ke naagarik adhikaar hasil karne ke maamle main kuch sudhaar hua he, lekin chuaachhut aaj bhi bade paimaane par jari he
 2 of caste discrimination and atrocities between 1995-2014
 43 lakh maamle darj hue hai
 This accounts for an average of 13,000 cases a year
 yah to sirf ek baangi bhar he, kyonki is tarah ke sirf gambhir maamle hi darj hote hai
 In the economic field, Dalits, once considered untouchable, face discrimination in various markets, including the labor market
 gramin kshetron main asprishy samajhe jane vaale daliton ko kuch tarah ke kaamon ke liye rojgaar nahin diya jaataa he jaise ki restaraan main or bacchon ke liye mid-de bhojan taiyaar karne ke liye rasoie kaa kaam
 Even giving them work as a waiter is avoided
 unhen badi jati ke shramikon ke mukaable kam din ke liye or kam paarishramik par rojgaar diya jaataa he, jabaki kuch duusare kaaryon ke liye unase jabaran kaam karaayaa jaataa he
 In cities, Dalits are called in for interview less than the upper castes in private companies, even if both have the same qualifications
 daliton ko kheti kii jameen kharidne main bhi bhedbhaav kaa saamana karnaa padataa he, isi tarah shaharon main gharon ke kiraaye ke maamle main bhi daliton ko bhedbhaav jhelana padataa he
 Dalits are discriminated against in the field of non-agricultural employment and trade
 desh main 6 rajyon ke 13 jilon main 90 dalit udhyamiyon ke anubhavon ke aadhaar par aseem prakaash ne paaya ki vibhinn bazaaron main anusuchit jati ke udhyamiyon or kaarobaariyon ko jatigat baadhaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 In terms of property ownership, in 2012, 20 percent of the total rural scheduled households were farmers and another 14 percent were small entrepreneurs or businessmen, compared to about 27 percent in urban areas
 2005 ke iconomic survey of privet enterprises se pataa chalata he ki desh ke kaarobaari bazaar main anusuchit jati kaa hissaa maatr 10 fisadi tha, jo unki kul aabaadi se kaaphi kam he
 Dalits are also behind in terms of education and share in civic amenities
 2014 main ucch shiksha ke liye namakan ke maamle main anusuchit jati kaa hissaa 22 fisadi tha, jabaki oonchi jatiyon kaa hissaa 42 fisadi tha
 Thus caste-based discrimination and poverty show that despite some degree of reform, Dalits still face discrimination on a large scale
 maanav vikaas ke maamle main unke or baaki ke bich antar he
 They still do not have the status of full citizens — in Ambedkar's words, they are "part of Hindu society, but a completely different part
" ''daliton ko aaj bahut-si chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Until the early 1990s, a major source of their progress was reservations in government jobs and education
 lekin nijeekaran kii teji se badhati dar ke kaaran ve donon strot khatm hote ja rahe hai
 In this way, privatization means the abolition of reservation
 sarkari naukariyon main bahut teji se kami ai he, jo ab sirf 20 fisadi he, jabaki 80 fisadi naukariyaan nijee kshetra main hai, or nijee kshetra main kisi tarah kaa aarakshan nahin he
 In the field of higher education, the number of students studying in private universities and colleges is about one-third of the total number of students and there is no reservation
 isliye 80 fisadi nijee naukariyon or 30 fisadi shiksha kshetra main daliton kii hissedari bahut hi kam he
 Thus there remain challenges for them in the private sector
 duusari chunauti rajnatik morche par he
 Political reservation has given place to dalits in the administrative and decision making areas
 vidhayika main daliton ko hissedari milane se ve apane paksh main nitiyaan banane main yogadan dete hai
 But his effective role has some limitations
 yah seemaa chunavi tareekon ke kaaran he
 Dr
 ambedkar kaa kahana tha ki rajnatik aarakshan ke chunavi system ke tahat daliton kaa chunaav ucch jati ke bahumat vot par nirbhar karata he
 This limits the influence of the Dalit legislature
 isiilie dow
 Ambedkar had demanded a separate electoral college for him, in which only Dalits could elect their candidates
 ab chunavi tareeke main sudhaar karne kaa samay aa gaya he, jisase ek swatantra dalit vidhanmandal ban sakegaa, jo unhen swatantra rup se kaam karne kaa mauka degaa
 Ambedkar suggested some protection for minorities in parliamentary democracy
 unka kahana tha ki bahumat vaali party jaruri nahin ki dharmanirpeksh hogi
 He therefore suggested that the Prime Minister and Minister of the majority party should be elected on behalf of the entire House, which includes the legislature of both the majority and minority political parties
 ambedkar ek anya chunauti ko lekar bhi chintit the or vah he ucch jatiyon ke prabhutv vaale prashasnic kshetra kaa bhedbhaav
 He believed that this discrimination would cause problems in implementing schemes related to Dalits

 Rather, this Airbus itself was hit by the co-pilot of the plane from the peaks of the mountain
 or wo bhi puure hosho-havaas main or jaanboojhkar
 After the crashing of the ill-fated airplane of the German Wings, as the agencies involved in its investigation are progressing, there are more than one shocking revelations
 1
 In the initial investigation itself, it has become clear that this air crash was not just the result of any technical fault or human error, but was the result of the action done in senses, due to which one hundred and fifty people lost their lives and such There was no one else but the co-pilot of this airplane, who had the responsibility of bringing all the passengers on this flight to their destination
 lekin yahi ko-payalat itane logon kii jaan kaa dushman ban gaya

 But as Captain Patrick in the middle flight was addressing aircraft passengers about his ground landing, his co-pilot Andrés's attitude with Patrick became a little hawk, and soon after that, with pilot Patrick cockpit Came out, the co-pilot wrote death in the fate of all one hundred passengers of this board

 According to the Investigation Officers, the conversation between the two pilots has been recorded in the black box, in which the main pilot is seen handing the plane charge to the co-pilot Andrés before going to the toilet from Captain Patrick's cockpit or leaving for some other reason
 Huh
 iske baad unke kursi se uthne kii aawaaj bhi aati he or cockpit ke daravaaje ke band hone kii bhi
 But whatever happens after that is terrible
 ko-payalat andres unke baahar nikalate hi flite ko teji se neeche utaarna shuru kar detaa he
 This airplane, flying at an altitude of 38 thousand feet so fast, takes only nine minutes to come up to 8 thousand feet and when the flight is at an altitude of 5 thousand feet, it would release the distress signal for ATC

 During this time, the traveler is silent, but the main pilot Patrick is heard from outside, banging on the cockpit door for ten minutes, asking the pilot to open the door repeatedly and trying to call him from the intercom
 lekin ko payalat andres bilkul shant rahata he or munh se kuch bhi nahin kahata
 Even she has no problem in breathing, because there is no sign of her in the cockpit to cope with any difficult situation
 lekin wo jaanboojh kar darwaja nahin kholta or phir aakhri chand seconds main musafiron kii bhayanak cheekh ke saath ek jordhar dhamaakaa hota he or sabakuch shant ho jaataa he

 In such a situation, the mystery of this co-pilot goes deeper
 yahi vajah he ki jaanch agenciyaan uske bankground main jhaankne kii koshish kar rahi he, taaki haadase ke pehle uski asal jehniyat kaa pataa chal sake

 Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi today started his tour from Porbandar, home of Mahatma Gandhi, to win the Gujarat assembly elections
 iske baad vah ahmedabad pahunche or dalit shakti centre ke dalit chaatro se vishaal tirangaa sweekaar kiya
 This tricolor is 125 feet in length and 83 feet in width
 is dauraan congress upaadhyaksh ne pradhanmantri narendra modi par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 During this, Rahul made a controversial statement that Rohit Vemula had not committed suicide
 hindustan kii sarkaar ne uski hatya kii thi
 He said that until the Gujarat elections are over, the Parliament will not run
 isaki vajah yah he ki piem modi jai shah, rafed or doklam masale par jawaab dena nahin chaahate hai
 He said, "parliament session should be started
 main sansad main jai shah, doklam or rafel par sawaal bhi poochna chahta hum
 "in the program of Dalits in Sanand, Ahmedabad, Rahul said that you made this flag with hard work
" piem or siem kii soch main tirange ke liye jagah nahin
 They only have space for 5-10 industrialists
 rohit vemula kii sarkaar ne kii hatyarahul gandhi ne kaha, ''mere dil main tirange ke liye jagah he
 During this, he also mentioned Rohit Vemula
 dalit masale ko lekar sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue congress upaadhyaksh ne kaha, ''kaise himmat kii rohit vemula ne ki shiksha ke liye college chalaa gaya? chitthee aati he ministar ke yahaan se or usko kuchal dete hai
 Rohit Vemula did not commit suicide, he was murdered by the Indian government
 ''roopani ne jhanda lene se kar diya tha inkargujrat congress pravaktaa manish doshi ne bataaya ki ab tak bana yah sabase bada rashtriya dhvaj he
 It was to be presented to Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, but he refused to accept it when the Dalits visited Gandhinagar in August
 jab rahulji ko is bare main pataa chalaa to unhone puure sammaan ke saath dhvaj ko sweekaar karne kii ichha jataai
 Privateer Ahul Gandhi said that 90 percent of the universities and colleges were made private
 gujarat main bahut college ban sakate hai
 But they do not have space
 modi ne jo 22 saal tak gujarat main kiya, wo ab hindustan main kar rahe hai
 He questioned what Rupani did for the Dalits in 22 years except for the Una and Rohit Vemula scandals, before Rahul Gandhi reached the Kriti Mandir in Porbandar
 porbandar main machhimaar adhikaar sabha ke logon ne rahul kaa swaagat kiya
 After this, Bharat Bhai Modi of Machhimar Adhikar Sabha informed the problem of fishermen to Rahul Gandhi
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne gujarat ke porbandar main machuaaron ko jai ram ji karke apana sambodhan shuru kiya
 Rahul said that Tata Nions has appeared in the last three-four years
 tata nayanon ko banane ke liye narendra modi ne 33 hajaar karod rupee die
 The UPA government gave as much money for MNREGA
 utana paisa modi ne tata ko nayanon ko banane ke liye de diya he
 Rahul said that two sons of Gujarat, Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel, have driven the British out of the country
 aap log bijepi ko gujarat kii satta se baahar karo
 Rahul said that Congress government is coming to Gujarat
 congress kii sarkaar banegi, jo vidhansabha or mukhyamantri ke daravaaje aap logon ke liye khulenge
 The BJP has closed the doors for the poor and common people for 22 years
 congress is daravaaje ko kholegi or janata ke man kii baat sunegi
 Rahul said that like Modi, mind will not be imposed
 rahul ne kaha ki pichley 22 saal main sara kaam paanch saat udyogpatiyon ke hit main modi main kaam aae hai
 The Congress has acted in the interest of fishermen
 machuaaron kaa sanghathan congress ne banaaya he
 There is Machad behind this
 jo kaam kisaan karata he vahi kaam machuaaraa karata he
 Rahul said that ten to twenty industrialists of Modi are spreading pollution
 iske chalate machuaaron ko dur tak machhlee pakadaney janaa padataa he
 Rahul said that Modi is giving 33 thousand crore rupees to industrialists, but has not given 300 crores to farmers
 modi ne notebandi kii aap log pareshaan hue line main lage, lekin suut boot waalon ko line main lage hue dekha
 Rahul Gandhi arrived among the fishermen
 machhimaar adhikaar sabha ke logon ne apni samasyaon ko rahul gandhi ke saamne rakhaa
 Demanded a separate ministry for fissing

 Here Rahul Gandhi again targeted the Modi government
 yahaan rahul ne kaha ki pehali baar is pradesh main dekha he jab sabhi samaaj ke log andolan kar rahe hai
 He said that he has read in the newspaper that the BJP is using magic in campaigning
 unhone sawaal kiya ki kya ek jaadugar kam nahin he? rahul ne kaha ki pichley saal 8 november ko ek jaadugar ne 500 or 1000 kaa note gaayab karne kaa jaadu kiya
 After that there was the magic of Gabbar Singh Tax

 On 11 May Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was praised by Subramanian Swamy for his experience and knowledge
 tab kaha tha ki ve ek mashhoor arthshaastri hai or main unase mashvira karata hum
 Within a month, Arun Jaitley has to give some more clarification about Swami
 bhartiya rigerv bank ke baad subramanyam swami ne mukhya aarthik salaahkaar arvind subramanyam ko thik vaise hi nishaanaa banaaya jaise unhone raghuram rajan par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 He said that on 13-3-13, who told the US Congress that America should take action against India to protect the interests of American pharmaceutical companies? Arvind Subramaniam of Ministry of Finance !! Take them out !!! abhi tak swami ke is aarope kaa kisi ne khandan nahin kiya he
 It is obvious that the government would have made headlines with this statement only that a month before, the finance minister, who had described Swamy as a famous economist, had to say something in which his and the government's blush is more visible
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki party ne kaha he ki vah doctor swami ke mat se sahamat nahin he
 i also want to add one more thing to the discipline of Indian leaders, to what extent we can attack those who cannot respond due to the extent and discipline of the post and this has happened more than once
 sawaal swami ko lekar tha, magar vitt mantri ne naseehat bhartiya rajanetaaon ko de di
 While Swami is the leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 rashtriya kaaryakarini ke sadsy hai or rajyasabha main bhi bheje gaye hai
 Will Swami follow Jaitley's advice? rajyasabha main bheje jane se pehle se hi ve vitt mantri ko bhi nishaanaa banaate rahe hai
 In 2015, on the issue of black money and inflation, i had said that i have written a letter to the government telling six measures to bring black money, but the method the finance minister is adopting will not bring black money
 swami ne jetali ke kalaadhan vidheyak kii bhi aalochana karte hue kaha tha ki isse kuch nahin hone vaala he
 Congress leader Digvijay Singh has tweeted that Subramanian Swamy is targeting Arun Jaitley on the pretext of Arvind Subramanian
 vaise swami jitna jetali ko target kar lete hai, usase zyada khulkar ve sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ko bhi nishaanaa banaate hai
 Happy with Swamy's attack in the agustawestlad case in the Rajya Sabha on 4 May, BJP is missing the warning of Congress leader Anand Sharma
 "ye jo tohfa pesh kiya he, inke sabase varisht netaa, mananeey atal ji, aap sabhi, jo aar es es ke log baithe hai, aar es es ke bare main kitni aarti utaari he, aap thode din chup rahiye yah top kahaan mudegi phir main aapse puuchhuunga
 How many of you are bursting with laddus in your heart, and how many people are worried because this gift is such a unique gift
 " When Swamy was carrying out the attack against Raghuram Rajan, after his email describing the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India as a Government of India employee, no one said that Swamy had this personal opinion
 unhen nahin bolnaa chahie
 When the owner becomes official and when the official is not known
 kya swami tab bhi anofitial the jab ve dilli main arvind kejariwal ke ghar ke baahar bijepi saansad mahesh giri ke dharne main shaamil hue
 Then Swami said that i was still behind Rajan, now he is gone
 ab main dilli par focus karuunga
 The Deputy Governor does not have time to save our innocent MP
 mukhyamantri ne daawa kiya he ki ve iaiti ke pratibhashali chaatr rahe hai
 i have documents of the way he has taken admission
 swami tab to oficial the or arvind kejariwal par hamale kii baat kar rahe the
 But before Arvind Kejriwal, only Arvind Subramanian was targeted
 kya yahaan bhi swami anofishyal hai, jab pichley saal oktober main jaiprakash narayan kii 113veen jayanti ke maukey par vigyaan bhawan main ek kaarykram hua tha
 In this, Prime Minister Modi honored Swami and praised him how during the Emergency Swamy went abroad to challenge the image of Indira Gandhi
 is kaarykram main kai rajyapal, punjab ke mukhyamantri or gandhinagar ke saansad or purv up pradhanmantri laalkrishna adwani ko bhi sammanit kiya gaya tha
 The Prime Minister's speech in praise of Swami is present on youtube
 aaj jaise hi swami ne mukhya aarthik salaahkaar arvind subramanyam par hamalaa kiya yah tark diya jane laga ki unki vyaktigat raay he
 Do other leaders in the BJP also have the leeway to personally attack the Chief Economic Advisor of the government
 kya anya netaa bhi sarkaar ke kisi hisse kii rashtriyata yaa rashtrabhakti par andeh karne kii chhot le sakate hai
 Swamy not only described Arvind Subramaniam as a pro-american, but also said that you think who encouraged the Congress to stick to the provisions of GST
 jetali ke aarthik salaahkaar arvind subramanyam of washington disi
 The Washington Minister's advice to the Finance Minister's advisor and GST to incite the Congress to stubbornly cannot be unofficial
 elahabaad kii kaaryakarini main bhartiya janata party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha tha ki endie kii sarkaar nirnay lene vaali sarkaar he
 Confusion between political leadership and bureaucracy has disappeared
 sarkaar nirnay leti he or naukarshahi lagu karti he
 If this is true, is it possible that one of the chief bureaucrats in the Finance Ministry is inciting the opposition against the policy of his own government
 vaise swami ne jo kaha hamane uski padtaal karne kii koshish kii
 The Committee on Ways and Means of the US House of Representatives has its own website
 yahaan par subramanyan testmani naam se 25 pannon kii ek file milegi
 Arvind Subramanian presented his review to the Committee of the US Parliament in March 2013 as a Senior Fellow of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and Center for Global Development, Washington DC
 iskaa topic he dipaning yues india trade relations
 It mentions those things that the American companies face in India
 duusare mulkon ke saath bharat ke vyapaar samjhaute ke kaaran amareeki hiton ko nuksaan hota he
 They are stating that India's tax environment is weak and uncertain
 jisaki vajah se civil newclear bijness, buniyadi kshetra or dawaaon ke kshetra ke kaarobaar main asar padataa he
 Arvind Subramanian has clearly stated that Combined with the fact of India's large and growing market, US suppliers can really be disadvantaged
 matlab ve kah rahe hai ki bharat ke vishaal or badhate bazaar ke sandarbh main amareeki saplir vaaki ghate kii sthiti main ho sakate hai
 Arvind Subramanian is advising that America should go against India to the World Trade Organization
 ye or baat he ki vishwa vyapaar sanghathan main bharat kaa record acha he
 They are giving advice to trade organizations in the United States about how to persuade Indian company and exporters so that India can change its policies under pressure
 har duusari teesri baat ko rashtravaadi kii nazar se dekhne kii vakaalat karne vaali bijepi, uski sarkaar ke mantri or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh is report ko kaise dekhenge
 Would he like to see a report of India's Chief Economic Advisor from three years ago through the prism of the same nationalism
 swami se pehle bhi ye baat us vakt uthi jab arvind subramanyan aarthik salaahkaar bane the
 Then why Swami had not spoken an active attack like this
 21 oktober, 2014 ke din firstpost par ji pramod kumaar ne arvind subramanyan ke bare main ek lekh likhaa tha jiskaa sheershak tha ki bharat yaa america, mukhya aarthik salaahkaar subramanyan kiske hiton kii seva karenge
 This article mentions Subramanian's report
 patrkaar ji pramod kumaar ne apane lekh main sawaal uthaaye hai ki ek vyapaar visheshgy jo america ke hiton ke liye kaam kar rahaa tha, wo aarthik salaahkaar bana he
 Arvind Subramanian did not say anything on the move, but instead presented his report before the Committee of the Parliament of America which was against India and in favor of America's business interests
 swami ko yah bhi bataanaa chahie ki kya bharat sarkaar ne arvind subramanyan ko kisi dabaav main apana aarthik salaahkaar niyukt kiya he
 If we see every economist on the basis of their involvement with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, then the Modi government will have to make Swami from the Reserve Bank to the Economic Advisor
 kya iske peeche rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or swadeshi brigade kii bechaini ho sakati he ki kab tak baahar se aae ye arthshaastri nitiyon par chaaye rahenge
 If so, then where is his fiery reaction, when the Prime Minister is declaring that India is the most open economy in the world
 madhumakhipaalan tak main videshi nivesh kii anumati di gai he
 We should also see whether Swami is personally a critic of the open economy
 media se ve kehete rahe hai ki 90 ke dashak main udaarikaran kaa blueprint unhone taiyaar kiya, lekin shrey manmohan singh ko mil gaya
 Is there any point in questioning whether that blueprint was indigenous or American
 khud swami bhi to kai saal america main padhaa chuke hai
 The comments unke twitor par maujuud tamaam tasviren bataati hai ki swami apane raajnneetik ateet se nahin bhaagate
 On his handle are photographs of the Janata Dal era, with Rajiv Gandhi
 main you-tub par maujuud radio boston par unka ek intervyuu sun rahaa tha
 His course was canceled and fired by Harvard that year due to an article by Swamy
 harvard kaa maananaa tha ki swami ne apane lekh ke zariye sampradayik hinsa uksaane kaa kaam kiya he
 In this interview, Swamy says that he loves Harvard
 harvard ko samajhnaa chahie ki main bharat main rajaneta hum or america main ecchemic kii tarah aata hum
 Swami himself demands to understand the different roles in America and India, but would he like to give this exemption to Rajan or Arvind Subramanian that his opinion is a matter like that of a trade expert in America and as India's economic advisor Their work is different, like Swami is a leader in India and Academic in America
 swami ke aaropon ko khaarij karnaa alag baat he or sarkaar kii suvidha ke anusaar bhartiya janata party yaa modi sarkaar yaa sangh parivaar ke skim se unhen nikaal dena alag baat he
 Subramanian Swamy is also an economist
 magar ve raajnneeti ke bhavuk muddon main bhi dakhal rakhte hai or arthshaastra ke neeras masalon ko bhi raajnneetik rup se bhavuk bana dete hai
 Did Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian testify against India's interests before the US Parliament
 is sawaal kaa swami koun he
 Meaning who will answer
 abhi tak swami ke is aarope kaa kisi ne khandan nahin kiya he
 It is obvious that the government would have made headlines with this statement only that a month before, the finance minister, who had described Swamy as a famous economist, had to say something in which his and the government's blush is more visible
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki party ne kaha he ki vah doctor swami ke mat se sahamat nahin he
 i also want to add one more thing to the discipline of Indian leaders, to what extent we can attack those who cannot respond due to the extent and discipline of the post and this has happened more than once
 sawaal swami ko lekar tha, magar vitt mantri ne naseehat bhartiya rajanetaaon ko de di
 While Swami is the leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 rashtriya kaaryakarini ke sadsy hai or rajyasabha main bhi bheje gaye hai
 Will Swami follow Jaitley's advice? rajyasabha main bheje jane se pehle se hi ve vitt mantri ko bhi nishaanaa banaate rahe hai
 In 2015, on the issue of black money and inflation, i had said that i have written a letter to the government telling six measures to bring black money, but the method the finance minister is adopting will not bring black money
 swami ne jetali ke kalaadhan vidheyak kii bhi aalochana karte hue kaha tha ki isse kuch nahin hone vaala he
 Congress leader Digvijay Singh has tweeted that Subramanian Swamy is targeting Arun Jaitley on the pretext of Arvind Subramanian
 vaise swami jitna jetali ko target kar lete hai, usase zyada khulkar ve sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ko bhi nishaanaa banaate hai
 Happy with Swamy's attack in the agustawestlad case in the Rajya Sabha on 4 May, BJP is missing the warning of Congress leader Anand Sharma
 "ye jo tohfa pesh kiya he, inke sabase varisht netaa, mananeey atal ji, aap sabhi, jo aar es es ke log baithe hai, aar es es ke bare main kitni aarti utaari he, aap thode din chup rahiye yah top kahaan mudegi phir main aapse puuchhuunga
 How many of you are bursting with laddus in your heart, and how many people are worried because this gift is such a unique gift
 " When Swamy was carrying out the attack against Raghuram Rajan, after his email describing the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India as a Government of India employee, no one said that Swamy had this personal opinion
 unhen nahin bolnaa chahie
 When the owner becomes official and when the official is not known
 kya swami tab bhi anofitial the jab ve dilli main arvind kejariwal ke ghar ke baahar bijepi saansad mahesh giri ke dharne main shaamil hue
 Then Swami said that i was still behind Rajan, now he is gone
 ab main dilli par focus karuunga
 The Deputy Governor does not have time to save our innocent MP
 mukhyamantri ne daawa kiya he ki ve iaiti ke pratibhashali chaatr rahe hai
 i have documents of the way he has taken admission
 swami tab to oficial the or arvind kejariwal par hamale kii baat kar rahe the
 But before Arvind Kejriwal, only Arvind Subramanian was targeted
 kya yahaan bhi swami anofishyal hai, jab pichley saal oktober main jaiprakash narayan kii 113veen jayanti ke maukey par vigyaan bhawan main ek kaarykram hua tha
 In this, Prime Minister Modi honored Swami and praised him how during the Emergency Swamy went abroad to challenge the image of Indira Gandhi
 is kaarykram main kai rajyapal, punjab ke mukhyamantri or gandhinagar ke saansad or purv up pradhanmantri laalkrishna adwani ko bhi sammanit kiya gaya tha
 The Prime Minister's speech in praise of Swami is present on youtube
 aaj jaise hi swami ne mukhya aarthik salaahkaar arvind subramanyam par hamalaa kiya yah tark diya jane laga ki unki vyaktigat raay he
 Do other leaders in the BJP also have the leeway to personally attack the Chief Economic Advisor of the government
 kya anya netaa bhi sarkaar ke kisi hisse kii rashtriyata yaa rashtrabhakti par andeh karne kii chhot le sakate hai
 Swamy not only described Arvind Subramaniam as a pro-american, but also said that you think who encouraged the Congress to stick to the provisions of GST
 jetali ke aarthik salaahkaar arvind subramanyam of washington disi
 The Washington Minister's advice to the Finance Minister's advisor and GST to incite the Congress to stubbornly cannot be unofficial
 elahabaad kii kaaryakarini main bhartiya janata party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha tha ki endie kii sarkaar nirnay lene vaali sarkaar he
 Confusion between political leadership and bureaucracy has disappeared
 sarkaar nirnay leti he or naukarshahi lagu karti he
 If this is true, is it possible that one of the chief bureaucrats in the Finance Ministry is inciting the opposition against the policy of his own government
 vaise swami ne jo kaha hamane uski padtaal karne kii koshish kii
 The Committee on Ways and Means of the US House of Representatives has its own website

 Arvind Subramanian presented his review to the Committee of the US Parliament in March 2013 as a Senior Fellow of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and Center for Global Development, Washington DC
 iskaa topic he dipaning yues india trade relations
 It mentions those things that the American companies face in India
 duusare mulkon ke saath bharat ke vyapaar samjhaute ke kaaran amareeki hiton ko nuksaan hota he
 They are stating that India's tax environment is weak and uncertain
 jisaki vajah se civil newclear bijness, buniyadi kshetra or dawaaon ke kshetra ke kaarobaar main asar padataa he
 Arvind Subramanian has clearly stated that Combined with the fact of India's large and growing market, US suppliers can really be disadvantaged

 Arvind Subramanian is advising that America should go against India to the World Trade Organization

 Would he like to see a report of India's Chief Economic Advisor from three years ago through the prism of the same nationalism
 swami se pehle bhi ye baat us vakt uthi jab arvind subramanyan aarthik salaahkaar bane the
 Then why Swami had not spoken an active attack like this
 21 oktober, 2014 ke din firstpost par ji pramod kumaar ne arvind subramanyan ke bare main ek lekh likhaa tha jiskaa sheershak tha ki bharat yaa america, mukhya aarthik salaahkaar subramanyan kiske hiton kii seva karenge

 is sawaal kaa swami koun he
 Meaning who will answer
 congress netaa digvijay singh ne twit kiya he ki subramanyam swami, arvind subramanyam ke bahaane arun jetali ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 By the way Swami targets Jaitley more openly, he also targets Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi
 4 may ko rajyasabha main agusta westelad maamle main swami ke hamale se khush bijepi ko congress netaa anand sharma kii chetavanee yaad aa rahi he
 "the gift that you have presented, its most senior leader, Honorable Atal ji, all of you, who are sitting in the RSS, how much arti has been performed about the RSS, you keep quiet for a few days, where will this cannon turn again?" i will ask you aap main se kitne logo ke dil main laddu foot rahe hai or kitne log chintaa main he kyonki yah tohfa hi aisa nayab tohfa he
 " jab swami, raghuram rajan ke khilaaf hamale kar rahe the, unke email ke baad bhartiya reserve bank ke garvanar ko bharat sarkaar kaa karmchaaree bataa rahe the, tab kisi ne nahin kaha ki swami kii yah vyaktigat raay he
 They should not speak
 swami kab oficial ho jate hai or kab anofitial pataa nahin chalata
 Was Swami still unofficial when he joined the dharna of BJP MP Mahesh Giri outside Arvind Kejriwal's house in Delhi
 tab swami ne kaha ki main abhi tak rajan ke peeche the, ab ve chale gaye hai
 Now i will focus on Delhi
 up rajyapal ke paas hamaare bekasoor saansad ko bachaane kaa vakt nahin he
 The Chief Minister has claimed that he has been a talented student of IIT
 jis tarah usne admician liya he uske dastauez hai mere paas
 Swami was then an official and was talking about an attack on Arvind Kejriwal
 magar arvind kejariwal se pehle arvind subramanyam ko hi nishaanaa bana daalaa
 Is Swami unofficial here as well, when in October last year, a program was held at Vigyan Bhavan to mark the 113th birth anniversary of Jayaprakash Narayan
 isamen pradhanmantri modi ne swami ko sammanit karte hue unki khub tarif kii ki kaise apatkaal ke vakt swami ne videshon main jaakar indira gandhi kii chhavi ko chunauti dene kaa kaam kiya
 Several governors, Punjab Chief Minister and MP from Gandhinagar and former Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani were also honored at the event
 swami kii tarif main diya pradhanmantri kaa bhaashan utyub par maujuud he
 Today, as Swami attacked Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian, it was argued that he had a personal opinion
 kya bijepi main anya netaaon ko bhi yah chhot he ki sarkaar ke mukhya aarthik salaahkaar par vyaktigat rup se hamalaa kar saktaa he
 Can other leaders also take the liberty to doubt the nationality or patriotism of any part of the government
 swami ne arvind subramanyam ko sirf americaparast hi nahin bataaya, balki yah bhi kaha ki aap ges kiijie ki kisne congress ko jiesti ke praavdhaanon ko lekar ad jane ke liye protsaahit kiya
 Jaitley's Economic Advisor Arvind Subramaniam of Washington DC
 vitt mantri ke salaahkaar ko washington disi kaa bataanaa or jiesti par congress ko ad jane ke liye uksaane kaa aarope anofitial vyakti kaa nahin ho saktaa he
 In the executive committee of Allahabad, BJP National President Amit Shah had said that the NDA government is a decision-making government
 raajnneetik netritv or naukarshahi ke bich kaa kanfuzan dur ho gaya he
 The government makes decisions and implements bureaucracy
 agar yah sahi he to kya yah mumkin he ki vitt mantralayal kaa ek mukhya naukarshah apni hi sarkaar kii niti ke khilaaf vipaksh ko uksaa rahaa ho
 By the way, we tried to investigate what Swami said
 america ke house of ripragentive kii cameti on veg and meens kii apni ek website hi he
 Here a file of 25 pages under the name Subramanian Testimony will be found
 washington disi sthit Peterson Institute for International Economics and Center for Global Development ke senior phelo ke taur par march 2013 main arvind subramanyan ne amareeki sansad kii cameti ko apni samiksha pesh kii thi
 Its topic is Deepening US India Trade Relations
 isamen un baton kaa zikr he ki america kii companiyon ko bharat main karabor karne main kya-kya dikkatein aati hai
 India's trade with other countries results in loss of US interests
 ve bataa rahe hai ki bharat kaa tex vaataavaran kamazor he or anishchit he
 Because of which there is an impact in the business of civil nuclear business, infrastructure sector and medicines
 arvind subramanyan ne saaf-saaf kaha he ki Combined with the fact of India's large and growing market, US suppliers can really be disadvantaged
 Meaning they are saying that in the context of India's large and growing market, American suppliers can be in a position of loss
 arvind subramanyan salaah de rahe hai ki america ko bharat ke khilaaf vishwa vyapaar sanghathan main janaa chahie
 It is another matter that India has a good record in the World Trade Organization
 ve america ke vyapaar sanghathanon ko raay de rahe hai ki kis tarah se bhartiya company or niyaartakon ko majubar karen, taaki bharat dabaav main aakar apni nitiyon main badlaav kare
 How the BJP, its government ministers and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, who advocated looking at every other third point from a nationalist point of view, would see this report
 kya ve bharat ke mukhya aarthik salaahkaar kii teen saal pehle kii ek report ko usee rashtrawaad ke chashme se dekhnaa chahenge
 Even before Swamy this thing arose when Arvind Subramanian became an economic advisor
 tab swami ne is tarah se sakriy hamalaa kyon nahin bolaa tha
 On firstpost on 21 October 2014, g Pramod Kumar wrote an article about Arvind Subramanian titled whose interests would be served by Chief Economic Advisor Subramanian, India or USA
 is lekh main subramanyan kii is report kaa zikr he
 Journalist Pramod Kumar has raised questions in his article that a business expert who was working for the interests of America has become an economic advisor
 arvind subramanyan ne yun hi chalate phirte koi baat nahin kahi thi, balki baqayda america kii sansad kii cameti ke saamne apana prativedan pesh kiya tha jo bharat ke khilaaf or america ke vyapaarik hiton ke paksh main tha
 Swamy should also tell whether the Government of India has appointed Arvind Subramanian as its economic advisor under any pressure
 agar har arthshaastri ko ham unke vishwa bank or antarrashtriya mudra kosh se jude hone ke aadhaar par dekhenge to modi sarkaar ko swami ko hi reserve bank se lekar aarthik salaahkaar bananaa pad jayega
 Could it be because of the restlessness of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Swadeshi Brigade that how long these economists who come from outside will remain under the policies
 agar aisa he to uski wo ugr pratikriya kahaan he, jab pradhanmantri yah elaan kar rahe hai ki bharat duniya kii sabase khuli arthvyavastha he
 Foreign investment has also been allowed in bee keeping
 hamen yah bhi dekhnaa chahie ki kya swami vyaktigat taur par khuli arthvyavastha ke aalochak hai
 He has been telling the media that in the 90s he prepared the blueprint for liberalization, but Manmohan Singh got the credit
 kya yah sawaal karne kaa koi matlab he ki wo blueprint swadeshi tha yaa amareeki
 Swami himself has also taught in America for many years 
 tippaniyan All the pictures on his Twitter show that Swamy does not run away from his political past
 unke handle par janata dal ke daur kii tasviren hai, rajeev gandhi ke saath kii tasveere hai
 i was listening to one of his interviews on Radio Boston on youtube
 us saal swami ke ek lekh ke kaaran harvard ne unka course radd kar diya or unhen nikaal diya tha
 Harvard believed that Swamy, through his article, had incited communal violence
 is intervyuu main swami kehete hai ki ve harvard se pyaar karte hai
 Harvard should understand that i am a politician in India and come to the USA as academic
 khud swami apane liye america or bharat main alag-alag role ko samajhane kii maang karte hai lekin kya ve yah chhot rajan yaa arvind subramanyan ko dena chahenge ki america main vyapaar visheshgy kii tarah unki raay ek baat he or bharat ke aarthik salaahkaar ke rup main unka kaam alag, jaise swami bharat main netaa hai or america main ecchemic
 Dismissing Swamy's allegations is another matter and it is a different thing to get him removed from the Bharatiya Janata Party or Modi government or the Sangh Parivar scheme as per the convenience of the government
 subramanyam swami bhi arthshaastri hai
 But they also interfere in the emotional issues of politics and also make the monotonous issues of economics politically emotional
 kya mukhya aarthik salaahkaar arvind subramanyan ne amareeki sansad ke saamne bharat ke hiton ke khilaaf gavaahi di thi
 Who is the master of this question
 matlab jawaab koun degaa
 When Swamy was carrying out the attack against Raghuram Rajan, after his email describing the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India as a Government of India employee, no one said that Swamy had this personal opinion
 unhen nahin bolnaa chahie
 When the owner becomes official and when the official is not known
 kya swami tab bhi anofitial the jab ve dilli main arvind kejariwal ke ghar ke baahar bijepi saansad mahesh giri ke dharne main shaamil hue
 Then Swami said that i was still behind Rajan, now he is gone
 ab main dilli par focus karuunga
 The Deputy Governor does not have time to save our innocent MP
 mukhyamantri ne daawa kiya he ki ve iaiti ke pratibhashali chaatr rahe hai
 i have documents of the way he has taken admission
 swami tab to oficial the or arvind kejariwal par hamale kii baat kar rahe the
 But before Arvind Kejriwal, only Arvind Subramanian was targeted
 kya yahaan bhi swami anofishyal hai, jab pichley saal oktober main jaiprakash narayan kii 113veen jayanti ke maukey par vigyaan bhawan main ek kaarykram hua tha
 In this, Prime Minister Modi honored Swami and praised him how during the Emergency Swamy went abroad to challenge the image of Indira Gandhi
 is kaarykram main kai rajyapal, punjab ke mukhyamantri or gandhinagar ke saansad or purv up pradhanmantri laalkrishna adwani ko bhi sammanit kiya gaya tha
 The Prime Minister's speech in praise of Swami is present on youtube
 aaj jaise hi swami ne mukhya aarthik salaahkaar arvind subramanyam par hamalaa kiya yah tark diya jane laga ki unki vyaktigat raay he
 Do other leaders in the BJP also have the leeway to personally attack the Chief Economic Advisor of the government
 kya anya netaa bhi sarkaar ke kisi hisse kii rashtriyata yaa rashtrabhakti par andeh karne kii chhot le sakate hai
 Swamy not only described Arvind Subramaniam as a pro-american, but also said that you think who encouraged the Congress to stick to the provisions of GST
 jetali ke aarthik salaahkaar arvind subramanyam of washington disi
 The Washington Minister's advice to the Finance Minister's advisor and GST to incite the Congress to stubbornly cannot be unofficial
 elahabaad kii kaaryakarini main bhartiya janata party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha tha ki endie kii sarkaar nirnay lene vaali sarkaar he
 Confusion between political leadership and bureaucracy has disappeared
 sarkaar nirnay leti he or naukarshahi lagu karti he
 If this is true, is it possible that one of the chief bureaucrats in the Finance Ministry is inciting the opposition against the policy of his own government
 vaise swami ne jo kaha hamane uski padtaal karne kii koshish kii
 The Committee on Ways and Means of the US House of Representatives has its own website
 yahaan par subramanyan testmani naam se 25 pannon kii ek file milegi
 Arvind Subramanian presented his review to the Committee of the US Parliament in March 2013 as a Senior Fellow of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and Center for Global Development, Washington DC
 iskaa topic he dipaning yues india trade relations
 It mentions those things that the American companies face in India
 duusare mulkon ke saath bharat ke vyapaar samjhaute ke kaaran amareeki hiton ko nuksaan hota he
 They are stating that India's tax environment is weak and uncertain
 jisaki vajah se civil newclear bijness, buniyadi kshetra or dawaaon ke kshetra ke kaarobaar main asar padataa he
 Arvind Subramanian has clearly stated that Combined with the fact of India's large and growing market, US suppliers can really be disadvantaged
 matlab ve kah rahe hai ki bharat ke vishaal or badhate bazaar ke sandarbh main amareeki saplir vaaki ghate kii sthiti main ho sakate hai
 Arvind Subramanian is advising that America should go against India to the World Trade Organization
 ye or baat he ki vishwa vyapaar sanghathan main bharat kaa record acha he
 They are giving advice to trade organizations in the United States about how to persuade Indian company and exporters so that India can change its policies under pressure
 har duusari teesri baat ko rashtravaadi kii nazar se dekhne kii vakaalat karne vaali bijepi, uski sarkaar ke mantri or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh is report ko kaise dekhenge
 Would he like to see a report of India's Chief Economic Advisor from three years ago through the prism of the same nationalism
 swami se pehle bhi ye baat us vakt uthi jab arvind subramanyan aarthik salaahkaar bane the
 Then why Swami had not spoken an active attack like this
 21 oktober, 2014 ke din firstpost par ji pramod kumaar ne arvind subramanyan ke bare main ek lekh likhaa tha jiskaa sheershak tha ki bharat yaa america, mukhya aarthik salaahkaar subramanyan kiske hiton kii seva karenge
 This article mentions Subramanian's report
 patrkaar ji pramod kumaar ne apane lekh main sawaal uthaaye hai ki ek vyapaar visheshgy jo america ke hiton ke liye kaam kar rahaa tha, wo aarthik salaahkaar bana he
 Arvind Subramanian did not say anything on the move, but instead presented his report before the Committee of the Parliament of America which was against India and in favor of America's business interests
 swami ko yah bhi bataanaa chahie ki kya bharat sarkaar ne arvind subramanyan ko kisi dabaav main apana aarthik salaahkaar niyukt kiya he
 If we see every economist on the basis of their involvement with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, then the Modi government will have to make Swami from the Reserve Bank to the Economic Advisor
 kya iske peeche rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or swadeshi brigade kii bechaini ho sakati he ki kab tak baahar se aae ye arthshaastri nitiyon par chaaye rahenge
 If so, then where is his fiery reaction, when the Prime Minister is declaring that India is the most open economy in the world
 madhumakhipaalan tak main videshi nivesh kii anumati di gai he
 We should also see whether Swami is personally a critic of the open economy
 media se ve kehete rahe hai ki 90 ke dashak main udaarikaran kaa blueprint unhone taiyaar kiya, lekin shrey manmohan singh ko mil gaya
 Is there any point in questioning whether that blueprint was indigenous or American
 khud swami bhi to kai saal america main padhaa chuke hai
 The comments unke twitor par maujuud tamaam tasviren bataati hai ki swami apane raajnneetik ateet se nahin bhaagate
 On his handle are photographs of the Janata Dal era, with Rajiv Gandhi
 main you-tub par maujuud radio boston par unka ek intervyuu sun rahaa tha
 His course was canceled and fired by Harvard that year due to an article by Swamy
 harvard kaa maananaa tha ki swami ne apane lekh ke zariye sampradayik hinsa uksaane kaa kaam kiya he
 In this interview, Swamy says that he loves Harvard
 harvard ko samajhnaa chahie ki main bharat main rajaneta hum or america main ecchemic kii tarah aata hum
 Swami himself demands to understand the different roles in America and India, but would he like to give this exemption to Rajan or Arvind Subramanian that his opinion is a matter like that of a trade expert in America and as India's economic advisor Their work is different, like Swami is a leader in India and Academic in America
 swami ke aaropon ko khaarij karnaa alag baat he or sarkaar kii suvidha ke anusaar bhartiya janata party yaa modi sarkaar yaa sangh parivaar ke skim se unhen nikaal dena alag baat he
 Subramanian Swamy is also an economist
 magar ve raajnneeti ke bhavuk muddon main bhi dakhal rakhte hai or arthshaastra ke neeras masalon ko bhi raajnneetik rup se bhavuk bana dete hai
 Did Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian testify against India's interests before the US Parliament
 is sawaal kaa swami koun he
 Meaning who will answer

 Subramanian Swamy is also an economist
 magar ve raajnneeti ke bhavuk muddon main bhi dakhal rakhte hai or arthshaastra ke neeras masalon ko bhi raajnneetik rup se bhavuk bana dete hai
 Did Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian testify against India's interests before the US Parliament
 is sawaal kaa swami koun he
 Meaning who will answer
 vitt mantri ke salaahkaar ko washington disi kaa bataanaa or jiesti par congress ko ad jane ke liye uksaane kaa aarope anofitial vyakti kaa nahin ho saktaa he
 In the executive committee of Allahabad, BJP National President Amit Shah had said that the NDA government is a decision-making government
 raajnneetik netritv or naukarshahi ke bich kaa kanfuzan dur ho gaya he
 The government makes decisions and implements bureaucracy
 agar yah sahi he to kya yah mumkin he ki vitt mantralayal kaa ek mukhya naukarshah apni hi sarkaar kii niti ke khilaaf vipaksh ko uksaa rahaa ho
 By the way, we tried to investigate what Swami said
 america ke house of ripragentive kii cameti on veg and meens kii apni ek website hi he
 Here a file of 25 pages under the name Subramanian Testimony will be found
 washington disi sthit Peterson Institute for International Economics and Center for Global Development ke senior phelo ke taur par march 2013 main arvind subramanyan ne amareeki sansad kii cameti ko apni samiksha pesh kii thi
 Its topic is Deepening US India Trade Relations
 isamen un baton kaa zikr he ki america kii companiyon ko bharat main karabor karne main kya-kya dikkatein aati hai
 India's trade with other countries results in loss of US interests
 ve bataa rahe hai ki bharat kaa tex vaataavaran kamazor he or anishchit he
 Because of which there is an impact in the business of civil nuclear business, infrastructure sector and medicines
 arvind subramanyan ne saaf-saaf kaha he ki Combined with the fact of India's large and growing market, US suppliers can really be disadvantaged
 Meaning they are saying that in the context of India's large and growing market, American suppliers can be in a position of loss
 arvind subramanyan salaah de rahe hai ki america ko bharat ke khilaaf vishwa vyapaar sanghathan main janaa chahie
 It is another matter that India has a good record in the World Trade Organization
 ve america ke vyapaar sanghathanon ko raay de rahe hai ki kis tarah se bhartiya company or niyaartakon ko majubar karen, taaki bharat dabaav main aakar apni nitiyon main badlaav kare
 How the BJP, its government ministers and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, who advocated looking at every other third point from a nationalist point of view, would see this report
 kya ve bharat ke mukhya aarthik salaahkaar kii teen saal pehle kii ek report ko usee rashtrawaad ke chashme se dekhnaa chahenge
 Even before Swamy this thing arose when Arvind Subramanian became an economic advisor
 tab swami ne is tarah se sakriy hamalaa kyon nahin bolaa tha
 On firstpost on 21 October 2014, g Pramod Kumar wrote an article about Arvind Subramanian titled whose interests would be served by Chief Economic Advisor Subramanian, India or USA
 is lekh main subramanyan kii is report kaa zikr he
 Journalist Pramod Kumar has raised questions in his article that a business expert who was working for the interests of America has become an economic advisor
 arvind subramanyan ne yun hi chalate phirte koi baat nahin kahi thi, balki baqayda america kii sansad kii cameti ke saamne apana prativedan pesh kiya tha jo bharat ke khilaaf or america ke vyapaarik hiton ke paksh main tha
 Swamy should also tell whether the Government of India has appointed Arvind Subramanian as its economic advisor under any pressure
 agar har arthshaastri ko ham unke vishwa bank or antarrashtriya mudra kosh se jude hone ke aadhaar par dekhenge to modi sarkaar ko swami ko hi reserve bank se lekar aarthik salaahkaar bananaa pad jayega
 Could it be because of the restlessness of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Swadeshi Brigade that how long these economists who come from outside will remain under the policies
 agar aisa he to uski wo ugr pratikriya kahaan he, jab pradhanmantri yah elaan kar rahe hai ki bharat duniya kii sabase khuli arthvyavastha he
 Foreign investment has also been allowed in bee keeping
 hamen yah bhi dekhnaa chahie ki kya swami vyaktigat taur par khuli arthvyavastha ke aalochak hai
 He has been telling the media that in the 90s he prepared the blueprint for liberalization, but Manmohan Singh got the credit
 kya yah sawaal karne kaa koi matlab he ki wo blueprint swadeshi tha yaa amareeki
 Swami himself has also taught in America for many years
 tippaniyan All the pictures on his Twitter show that Swamy does not run away from his political past
 unke handle par janata dal ke daur kii tasviren hai, rajeev gandhi ke saath kii tasveere hai
 i was listening to one of his interviews on Radio Boston on youtube
 us saal swami ke ek lekh ke kaaran harvard ne unka course radd kar diya or unhen nikaal diya tha
 Harvard believed that Swamy, through his article, had incited communal violence
 is intervyuu main swami kehete hai ki ve harvard se pyaar karte hai
 Harvard should understand that i am a politician in India and come to the USA as academic
 khud swami apane liye america or bharat main alag-alag role ko samajhane kii maang karte hai lekin kya ve yah chhot rajan yaa arvind subramanyan ko dena chahenge ki america main vyapaar visheshgy kii tarah unki raay ek baat he or bharat ke aarthik salaahkaar ke rup main unka kaam alag, jaise swami bharat main netaa hai or america main ecchemic
 Dismissing Swamy's allegations is another matter and it is a different thing to get him removed from the Bharatiya Janata Party or Modi government or the Sangh Parivar scheme as per the convenience of the government
 subramanyam swami bhi arthshaastri hai
 But they also interfere in the emotional issues of politics and also make the monotonous issues of economics politically emotional

 Swami himself demands to understand the different roles in America and India, but would he like to give this exemption to Rajan or Arvind Subramanian that his opinion is a matter like that of a trade expert in America and as India's economic advisor Their work is different, like Swami is a leader in India and Academic in America
 swami ke aaropon ko khaarij karnaa alag baat he or sarkaar kii suvidha ke anusaar bhartiya janata party yaa modi sarkaar yaa sangh parivaar ke skim se unhen nikaal dena alag baat he

 Meaning who will answer
 har duusari teesri baat ko rashtravaadi kii nazar se dekhne kii vakaalat karne vaali bijepi, uski sarkaar ke mantri or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh is report ko kaise dekhenge
 Would he like to see a report of India's Chief Economic Advisor from three years ago through the prism of the same nationalism
 swami se pehle bhi ye baat us vakt uthi jab arvind subramanyan aarthik salaahkaar bane the
 Then why Swami had not spoken an active attack like this
 21 oktober, 2014 ke din firstpost par ji pramod kumaar ne arvind subramanyan ke bare main ek lekh likhaa tha jiskaa sheershak tha ki bharat yaa america, mukhya aarthik salaahkaar subramanyan kiske hiton kii seva karenge
 This article mentions Subramanian's report
 patrkaar ji pramod kumaar ne apane lekh main sawaal uthaaye hai ki ek vyapaar visheshgy jo america ke hiton ke liye kaam kar rahaa tha, wo aarthik salaahkaar bana he
 Arvind Subramanian did not say anything on the move, but instead presented his report before the Committee of the Parliament of America which was against India and in favor of America's business interests
 swami ko yah bhi bataanaa chahie ki kya bharat sarkaar ne arvind subramanyan ko kisi dabaav main apana aarthik salaahkaar niyukt kiya he
 If we see every economist on the basis of their involvement with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, then the Modi government will have to make Swami from the Reserve Bank to the Economic Advisor
 kya iske peeche rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or swadeshi brigade kii bechaini ho sakati he ki kab tak baahar se aae ye arthshaastri nitiyon par chaaye rahenge
 If so, then where is his fiery reaction, when the Prime Minister is declaring that India is the most open economy in the world
 madhumakhipaalan tak main videshi nivesh kii anumati di gai he
 We should also see whether Swami is personally a critic of the open economy
 media se ve kehete rahe hai ki 90 ke dashak main udaarikaran kaa blueprint unhone taiyaar kiya, lekin shrey manmohan singh ko mil gaya
 Is there any point in questioning whether that blueprint was indigenous or American
 khud swami bhi to kai saal america main padhaa chuke hai
 The comments unke twitor par maujuud tamaam tasviren bataati hai ki swami apane raajnneetik ateet se nahin bhaagate
 On his handle are photographs of the Janata Dal era, with Rajiv Gandhi
 main you-tub par maujuud radio boston par unka ek intervyuu sun rahaa tha
 His course was canceled and fired by Harvard that year due to an article by Swamy

 bijepi or shivasena vaale kahaan peeche rahete, un donon ne congress ke khilaaf jehar ugala
 That is, a round of debate has started
 lekin aage aisa na ho is bare main kahin se koi bhi bayaan nahin
 The problem of Bangladeshi infiltrators in India is more than four decades old
 vahaan se bade paimaane main log avaidh rup se bharat main pravesh karte hai
 The opposition alleges that at least one crore Bangladeshis are living illegally in India
 ve har bade shahar main dikhte or rahete hai
 But they continue to make large-scale infiltrations in Assam
 aazaadee ke pehle se vahaan kii hari-bhari dharti par swaarthee tatwon kii nazren raheen or bade paimaane par purvi bengal se alpsankhyakon ko vahaan jane ko prerit kiya gaya
 Even after independence there was infiltration from East Pakistan but after the seventies it increased tremendously
 garibi or berogari senijaat paane ke liye lakhon bangladeshi bharat main ghus gaye lekin assam main yah samasya vikaraal rup dhaaran karti chali gai
 They settled quietly in the hilly places and forests there
 wo jameen jo adivaasiyon kii thi, us par ve chupchaap kabja jamaakar baith gaye
 They got the support of local leaders as they became vote banks
 isse assam main hiton kaa bada takaraav hua jiskaa parinaam 1983 main nelli dangon ke rup main dekha gaya
 Thousands of minorities lost their lives in that riots in Assam
 apni jameen par avrajak bangladeshiyon ko kabiz dekhakar adivaasiyon ne bade paimaane par katleam kiya
 But it did not happen that the infiltration stopped or any solution was found to this problem
 aisa ho bhi nahin saktaa tha kyonki kuchdhoort raajnneetigyon ko vot bank ke rup main unki upyogita samaj main aa gai or unka raajnneetik istemaal hone laga
 Now the question is how long people from Bangladesh will keep coming to India illegally? Will there ever be a concrete solution to this problem? The BJP is raising this issue in the elections, but during the NDA rule, no concrete work was done in that direction
 hajaaron kii taadaad main bangladeshi ghuspaithiye bharat aate rahe lekin unhen rokane ke thos upaay nahin hue
 This was not a big issue for the Congress, so no action was taken
 ab usase bhi bada sawaal he ki nai sarkaar ke satta par kabiz hone ke baad halaat main kuch badlaav honge kya? agar nahin hue to aane vaale samay main isi tarah khun kii nadiyaan bahati rahengi

 The UK Ministry of Home Affairs has approved the extradition order of Vijay Mallya, absconding with thousands of crores of Indian banks
 ab maalya ke pratyrpan kaa maamla puri tarah se court par nirbhar he
 The big question is whether Mallya can be brought to India till Lok Sabha elections i
e
 before May 2019, the answer is yes, but there are some buts for it
 aaie jaanate hai ki maalya kaa jald pratyrpan kis surat main sambhav he
 Significantly, the extradition of Vijay Mallya was ordered by Chief Magistrate of Westminster Magistrate Court, UK on 10 December 2018, which has been approved by the Home Minister Sajid Javed on 3 February
 ab vijay maalya ke paas upree adaalat main apil ke liye 14 din kaa samay he
 Mallya has also confirmed by tweeting that he is going to appeal against it
 maalya ko waapas laane ke liye centre kii narendra modi sarkaar or bhartiya jaanch agenciyon ne lambii ladaai ladi he
 Vijay Mallya, in his first reaction to the decision of the Home Department, wrote in the tweet, 'it was only after the decision of the Westminster Court on December 10, 2018 that i expressed my intention to appeal
 home secretary ke nirnay se pehle main apil kii prakriya kii shuruyaat nahin kar paaya
 Now i will start the appeal process
 'after the decision was handed down on December 10,2018 by the Westminster Magistrates Court, i stated my intention to appeal
 i could not initiate the appeal process before a decision by the Home Secretary
 Now i will initiate the appeal process
 - Vijay Mallya (@thevijaymallya) February 4, 2019 This is the appeal of Adchanmalya will first be heard in a bench of a High Court with a judge
 yah jaj bhi yadi pratyrpan ke aadesh par muhar lagaate hai, lekin aage apil kii anumati bhi de dete hai to uske baad maalya kii apil par hoicourt ke do jaj sunwaayee karenge
 Mallya can then appeal to the Supreme Court to hear his case there
 agar supreme court yah manjuur kar letaa he to puure maamle kii sunwaayee puri hone main kareeb 18 maheene lag jaaenge
 It is possible to bring India before May, but in the first phase of the appeal itself, if the High Court stamped the extradition and did not allow Mallya to appeal further, Mallya could be extradited to India as soon as possible
 tab is baat kii prabal sambhaavna hogi ki maalya ko may, 2019 se pehle hi bharat laayaa jaae
 Businessman Vijay Mallya has been a headache for the Indian government and many lending banks for the past several years
 9000 karod kaa karj lekar faraar maalya landan main giraftaar bhi hua tha, lekin use tatkaal jamaanat mil gai
 On 8 February 2017, the Indian government petitioned Mallya for extradition to Britain
 usee saal janvari main sibiai kii vishesh adaalat ne idibiai lone diphalt cese main maalya ke khilaaf gaiyr jamaanti warrant jari kiya tha
 In 2012, for the first time, the consortium of banks revealed that Vijay Mallya had taken a loan of about Rs 7,000 crore from them and could not repay it

 Is the Delhi government preparing to carry forward the Aud Evens implemented from November 4 to November 15? In fact, the Kejriwal government has once again raised the issue of stubble and advised the Center and neighboring states to find a solution
 arvind kejariwal ne media se baatcheet ke dauraan kaha, 'ham sab dekh rahe hai ki dilli main pradooshan, 10 oktober ke baad se paraali jalane kii vajah se aayaa
 In the past days, stubble has not been burnt due to rain in Punjab, Haryana, smoke has reduced in Delhi
 behad dukhad he ki supreme court ke sakht ke aadesh ko nahin mana ja rahaa he, jis vajah se dilli ke log pareshaan ho rahe hai
 'apart from this, Kejriwal while stating the solution to deal with Parali said,' i have met the experts in the last several days, i understand as an engineer
 paraali ko CNG main badal sakate hai
 a project foundation has been laid in Karnal
 maine indraprastha gas limited se baat kii he, wo paraali se banane vaali sari CNG kharidne ko taiyaar hai
 Apart from this, many factories in Punjab are making coal from Parali
 NTPC paraali kharidne ko taiyaar he
 But it is important to promote
 pradooshan kam ho jayega
 After all, why Punjab and Haryana do not promote such projects? ”arvind Kejriwal was then asked if the Odd Scheme would be extended in the face of deteriorating pollution situation in Delhi? Replying to this, Arvind Kejriwal said, 'if the need arises, we will definitely do it
 ' saath hi ek twit ke madhyam se kejariwal ne od ivan par vipakshi dalon ko gheraa he
 Kejriwal tweeted that i appeal to the opposition not to oppose odd even
 pradooshan kaaphi bad gaya he
 The whole of Delhi is demanding odd even
 vipaksh ko janata kaa saath dena chahie
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has also given a statement on the deteriorating image around the world due to pollution
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe hamaare logon kii sehat kii chintaa he or dilli desh kii rajdhani kii jo image ban rahi he uski bhi chintaa he

 This genre, which tried to laugh like this, was named, 'AIB Roast'
 is tandoor main roast karne ke liye jin do murgon ko laayaa gaya wo the film star arjuna kapur or ranvir singh

 This fresh interpretation of freedom of expression has raised many big questions

 Karan Johar played the conch shell of the show, but making sure that no middle class family of the country would see this 'insult Humor', it was announced by Karan Johar as he stepped on stage, 'let the Filth Begin' Create)

 saath hi, is sho main mail bodies ke prati bhi koi 'step brdalee treetment' nahin kiya gaya or karan johar ko bhi murga banaate hue is level tak laa khadaa kar diya gaya ki 'bas yahi aparaadh main har baar karata hum, aadmi hum aadmi se pyaar karata hum

 The video also has a disclaimer on youtube, 'this video is filmy, rood and offensive'

 During this time the Prime Minister shared many experiences and sayings of his life
 intervyuu ke dauraan piem modi ne ek anubhav bataate hue kaha ki vah samaajawaadee nahin balki ahmedaabadi hai
 Prime Minister Modi said that he had once visited Pune
 us samay vah aam taur par kurta pyjama pahana karte the, kandhe main ek jhola hota tha or saamaanya se juute pahane hote the or vah train se ghuma karte the
 He told that during one such visit he reached Pune
 pune railway stesan se vah paidal hi aresas ke daftar ja rahe the, usee dauraan unhone dekha ki ek auto rickshaw vaala unke saath hi dhire- dhire apni gaadi chalaata hua chal rahaa he
 PM Modi said that he must have traveled about 100-200 meters from the station, then he noticed that a rickshaw-puller is running parallel to him
 phir unhone rickshaw vaale se poocha ki aap rickshaw itnaa dhimaa kyon chalaa rahe hai, kya rickshaw kharaab he
 On this the rickshawman said that you will not sit on the rickshaw? PM said or not
 
 
 main to paidal hi ja rahaa hum
 The rickshawman said that you are a socialist? Modi said, 'no, i am Ahmadabadi
 'piem modi ne rickshaw vaale ke saath baatcheet saajha karte hue bataaya ki baad main rickshaw vaala bolaa ki mujhe laga ki aap samaajawaadee hai, kyonki pune main samaajawaadee log stesan se nikal kuch dur chalate hai taaki logon ko lage ki vah saadagi vaale log hai, mehnat karte hai, logon par prabhaav banane ke liye stesan dur jaakar rickshaw main baithte hai
 During this time Modi also spoke on other issues
 sena main bhartee hone ke alaava vah kya karnaa chaahate the? is par pradhanmantri ne bataaya ki main ramakrishna mishan ashram main chalaa gaya
 New experiences started happening
 20 saal ke aasapaas kii umr main hi bahut ghumaa, bhatka or duniya dekhi

 Saina and Sindhu have won silver at the world championships, but so far no Indian has reached gold
 sina, sindhu or shrikant ne bharat ko badminton kii mahashakti banane main madad kii he, lekin ye khilaadi vishwa patal par koi bada khitaab nahin jeet sake hai
 Saina has lost the World Championship finals once and Sindhu twice, while none of these three players have been able to win gold in recent years apart from the World Championship, the Olympic, Asian Games and the All England Championship
 ab basel main in khilaadiyon ke paas itihaas rachane kaa mauka he
 However, this path will not be so easy, because the performance of Indian players has been average this year
 dubles main is saal satvik sairaj rankireddy or chiraag shetty ke en maukey par baahar hone ke baad ab sina, sindhu or shrikant ke rup main teen bhartiya hi badimenton ke is mahakumbh main bharat kaa itihaas badalane kaa prayaas karenge

 In the third round, Sindhu may face world number-10 Beiwen Zhang of America
 jhang ke khilaaf world number-5 sindhu kaa record 4-3 kaa he, lekin 2018 main jhang ne sindhu ko do baar haraaya he
 Sindhu, who won silver in 2017 and 2018 and bronze in 2013 and 2014, can face World No-2 Taipei of Chinese Taipei in the quarter-finals if she manages to cross the hurdle
 is khilaadi ke khilaaf sindhu kaa record acha nahin he
 So far, there have been a total of 14 bouts between the two and Ying has won 10 times out of them
 beete saal disambar main haalanki sidhu ne ying ko haraaya tha
 It will be a relief for Sindhu that in the last two years, there has been a kind of decline in Ying's game and due to this she is no longer invincible
 isi tarah 2017 main kaansya or 2015 main rajat padak jeetne vaali sina kii pehali pariksha quarter final main hogi, jahaan unka saamana china kii cheng yu phei se hoga
 The Chinese player is the defending All England champion and has won four major titles this year
 sina agar yah baadha paar karne main safal raheen to vah semifinal main hamawatan sindhu yaa phir taae ju se bhindengi
 The relief for both these players is that this year, defending champion Carolina Marin of Spain is not coming on the court to save her title

 yaad kiijie aap ek hafte main kitni baar bolte hai ki mausam main bahut badlaav ho gaya he
 It does not rain either, it causes havoc with floods
 kai jagahon par nae nae record ban rahe hai
 Even in summer
 barish ke bhi or sookhe ke bhi
 The cities that we have considered the safest are now being drowned sitting down
 uttar bharat ke log aae din fasebuk par likhte rahete hai ki das pandrah saal pehle durgapuja ke samay ham phul sweater pahana karte the, yahaan to durga puja samet oktober biit gaya magar garmi he ki kanfus kar de rahi he
 Never run an AC, sometimes don't drive a fan
 iskaa matlab he ki ham is badlaav ko tab bhi mahasoos karte hai jab shahar main baadh kaa kahar na ho yaa jangalon main dawanal na ho
 After the death of hundreds of people, after thousands of houses have collapsed, we take the situation a few days later and then get lost in our world
 lekin jis duniya main ham kho jane kaa bhram paal rahe hai darasal us duniya ko hamane bahut pehle kho diya he
 The basic thing is that we have not left this earth worth living
 sanyukt raashtra kii ek sanstha he jo duniya bhar main green house gas ke utsarjan yani emishan yaa paidaa hone kii maatra par nazar rakhti he
 Its name is World Meteorological Organization (WMO)
 isaki ek report ke anusaar ham jinata samajhate hai, sthiti usase bhi adhik bhayakan he
 That is, now we will not see the amount of carbon dioxide decreasing in our lifetime because the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has crossed the level of 400 parts (ppm)
 pehle bhi CO2 kaa kansantreshan 400 ko paar kar chukaa he lekin tab kuch simit ilaakon main kuch maheene ke liye tha
 This is the first time that its volume has crossed 400 ppm for the entire year at the world level
 yah bataaya gaya he ki dharti par isse adhik carbon diaksaide kabhi bhi is str par nahin pahunchaa he
 Not even when close to 3
 8 arab saal pehle pehla bacterium bana hoga yaa ye kahen ki dharti par jivan kii utpatti ho rahi hogi
 This case has become quite technical, but if we say that due to this, every year two and a half million people will start dying
 jo zindaa rahenge unamem se 12
 2 crore will be pushed into the condition of poverty
 garmiyaan or bhi zyaada garm hongi, baadh or bhi zyaada bhayanak hongi or samudr zamin kaa or bada hissaa nigal legaa
 We hear again and again that the level of carbon dioxide has to be raised to the level of the industrial era
 dharti kaa taapmaana us samay ke taapmaana se 2 degree celsius se adhik nahin badhanaa chahie
 In the industrial era, the eighteenth century and now is the sixteenth year of the twenty-first century
 atharahavin sadin main carbon dioxide kii maatra aaj kii tulana main aadhi se kuch adhik hi thi
 Then the amount of carbon dioxide was 278 ppm
 yah ek adarsh maatra thi jiske kaaran samudr, vaataavaran or jaevmandal ke bich santulan bana hua tha
 Biosphere means earth and air, the place where we and you, all kinds of animals live
 audyogic kranti se hamane tel, koyala vagairah kaa koob istamaal karnaa shuru kar diya
 Due to which the amount of carbon dioxide started to increase and the balance of nature began to end
 2015 main carbon dioxide kaa kansantreshan audyogic daur se pehle ke muqaabale 144% zyaada ho gaya
 You will hear about greenhouse gas again and again
 carbon dioxide, methane or nitras oxide ko green house gas kaha jaataa he
 Carbon dioxide comprises 65% of the greenhouse gas
 carbon dioxide vaataavaran main rah jaataa he
 Generally, the sea, forest, tree plants, herb vegetables absorb carbon dioxide
 nai report kah rahi he ki carbon dioxide sokhne kii inaki kshamta ab kam hoti ja rahi he
 Right now they absorb half of the world's carbon dioxide, but the danger is that their capacity is also on the verge of reaching its maximum level
 matlab ab inase ye ummid nahin rakhni chahie ki hamaare gunahon par pardaa daal kar hamen bachaa lenge
 According to another information, between 1990 and 2015, the warming effect in our climate i
e
 heat increased by about 37 percent
 paris samjhaute ke tahat duniya main global warming kaa str audyogic daur se pehle ke muqaabale sirf 2 degree celsius se kam rakhane kii sambhaavna bhi bahut kam ho gai he
 It has been said that governments of all countries will have to implement the Paris Agreement fast
 varna ham dharti ko surakshit str par nahin pahunchaa sakenge
 The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is also creating a global data system for information exchange and information about which country is taking steps
 agar aap dilli yaa uske aas paas ke shaharon main rahete hai to in dinon par diwali gift se bhari kaaron se sadaken jam milengi or saans lene ke liye jo hawa he wo karaab milegi

 The level of 5 had reached 350 ug / m3 while PM2
 5 60 microgram prati cubic meter se zyaada nahin hona chahie
 You must remember that in January this year, in many places in Delhi, the air quality index was around 430 to 435 micrograms per cubic meter
 tab dilli main kitna hangaamaa hua tha
 The Delhi government also had to bring the formula of Odd Even

 Presently, the reason is due to traffic and the cloud cover has increased the accumulation of pollutants
 china na sahi, bhartiya pataakhe bhi to jalaayenge
 Also, the pollution level will be five times
 kai log kehete hai ki tyoharon kii raunak par nazar laga rahe hai
 In fact, pollution increases from day one because traffic on Delhi's roads is causing pollution every day
 aap trephic kam nahin kar sakate, aap pataakhe band nahin kar sakate, to samaadhaan kya he
 However, many have reduced or stopped using firecrackers
 baaki shaharon main bhi sthiti karaab he
 The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been maximized, what will happen if not
 ham is par to baat kar hi sakate hai kyonki ye to global ausat he
 But the world in which we are losing the illusion, in fact, we have lost that world long ago
 mul baat ye he ki hamane is dharti ko rahane laayak choda nahin he
 The United Nations is a body that monitors the emission or emission of greenhouse gases worldwide
 iskaa naam he World Meteorological Organization (WMO)
 According to one of its reports, the situation is more frightening than what we perceive
 yani ab ham apane jeevankaal main carbon dioxide kii maatra ko kam hote hue nahin dekh sakenge kyonki vaataavaran main carbon dioxide kaa kansantreshan yani jamaavada 400 parts par million (ppm) ke str ko paar kar chukaa he
 In the past, the concentration of CO2 has crossed 400, but then it was for a few months in some limited areas
 pehali baar aisa hua he ki puri duniya ke str par puure saal bhar ke liye isaki maatra 400 pipiem paar kar gai he
 It has been reported that no more carbon dioxide has ever reached this level on Earth
 tab bhi nahin jab qareeb 3
 The first bacterium would have been formed 8 billion years ago, or to say that life was originating on Earth
 kaaphi technical ho gaya ye maamla to lekin agar ham ye kahen ki iske kaaran duniya bhar main har saal dhai lakh logon kii maut hone lagegi
 12 of those who will live
 2 karod garibi kii haalat main dhakel diye jaaenge
 The summer will be even hotter, the floods will be even more terrible, and the sea will swallow a larger part of the land
 ham baar baar sunate hai ki carbon dioxide kaa str audyogic daur ke str tak le janaa he
 Earth's temperature should not increase more than 2 ° c above that time
 odyogic yug mane atharahavin sadi or abhi he ikkisvin sadi kaa solahavaan saal
 In the eighteenth century, the amount of carbon dioxide was less than half that of today
 tab carbon dioxide kii maatra thi 278 pipiem
 It was an ideal volume that caused a balance between the ocean, the atmosphere and the biosphere
 jaevmandal mane dharti or vaayu yani wo jagah jahaan ham or aap, tamaam tarah ke jeev jantu rahete hai
 With the Industrial Revolution, we started using oil, coal, etc
 jiske kaaran carbon dioxide kii maatra badhane lagi or prakruti kaa santulan khatm hone laga
 In 2015, carbon dioxide concentration was up 144% over the pre-industrial era
 green house gas kaa zikr aap baar baar sunate honge
 Carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are called greenhouse gases
 greenhouse gas main 65 fisadi hissaa carbon dioxide kaa hota he
 Carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere
 aam taur par samudr, jangal, ped paudhe, shaak sabziyaan carbon dioxide ko sokh lete hai
 The new report is saying that their ability to absorb carbon dioxide is now decreasing
 abhi to ye duniya ke aadhe carbon dioxide sokh lete hai magar khatara is baat kaa he ki inaki ye kshamta bhi apane adhiktam str par pahunchane ke kagaar par he
 Meaning, now they should not expect that they will save us by putting a curtain on our crimes
 ek or jaankaree ke mutabik 1990 se 2015 ke bich hamaare climet main warming effect yani garmi qareeb 37 fisadi badi
 Under the Paris Agreement, the possibility of keeping the level of global warming in the world below 2 degree Celsius before the industrial phase has also been greatly reduced
 kaha gaya he ki tamaam deshon kii sarkaron ko paris samjhaute ko tezi se lagu karnaa hoga
 Otherwise we will not be able to take the earth to a safe level
 World Meteorological Organization (WMO) soochnaaon ke aadan pradaan or koun desh kya kadam uthaa rahaa he isaki jaankaree ke liye ek global data system bhi bana rahaa he
 If you live in Delhi or its adjoining cities, then on these days, Diwali gift-filled cars will get jammed with roads and the air you breathe will get impaired
 tippaniyan PM2 on Delhi's air quality index according to the Monitoring Systems of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR)
 5 kaa str 321 microgram per cubic metre ho gaya he
 PM2 in Shahdara, Shantipath and Anand Vihar on Wednesday morning
 5 kaa str 350 ug / m3 tak pahunch gaya tha jabaki piem 2
 5 should not exceed 60 micrograms per cubic meter
 aapako yaad hi hoga ki isi saal janvari main dilli main kai jagahon par air quality index 430 se 435 microgram prati cubic meter ke aas paas ho gaya tha
 There was so much uproar in Delhi then
 dilli sarkaar ko bhi od ivan kaa formula lekar aana padaa tha
 a group that monitors Delhi's air pollution on Facebook said that your child will smoke fourteen cigarettes a day, three days before Diwali
 philhal kaaran to trephic ke kaaran he or badalon ke ghirne se bhi pradooshak tatwon kaa jamaavada badha he
 Not only China, Indian firecrackers will also be burnt
 isse bhi pradooshan kaa str paanch guna ho jayega
 Many people say that they are keeping an eye on the beauty of festivals
 darasal ek din se pradooshan isliye bhi badhata he ki dilli kii sadakon par trephic to rose hi pradooshan paidaa kar rahaa he
 You cannot reduce traffic, you cannot stop crackers, so what is the solution
 vaise bahuton ne pataakhon kaa istamaal kam kar diya he yaa band kar diya he
 The situation is bad in other cities also
 vaataavaran main carbon dioxide kii maatra adhik se bhi adhiktam ho gai he, ye jaaegi nahin to hoga kya
 We can only talk about it because it is a global average
 yah bataaya gaya he ki dharti par isse adhik carbon diaksaide kabhi bhi is str par nahin pahunchaa he

 aapako yaad hi hoga ki isi saal janvari main dilli main kai jagahon par air quality index 430 se 435 microgram prati cubic meter ke aas paas ho gaya tha
 There was so much uproar in Delhi then
 dilli sarkaar ko bhi od ivan kaa formula lekar aana padaa tha
 a group that monitors Delhi's air pollution on Facebook said that your child will smoke fourteen cigarettes a day, three days before Diwali
 philhal kaaran to trephic ke kaaran he or badalon ke ghirne se bhi pradooshak tatwon kaa jamaavada badha he
 Not only China, Indian firecrackers will also be burnt
 isse bhi pradooshan kaa str paanch guna ho jayega
 Many people say that they are keeping an eye on the beauty of festivals
 darasal ek din se pradooshan isliye bhi badhata he ki dilli kii sadakon par trephic to rose hi pradooshan paidaa kar rahaa he
 You cannot reduce traffic, you cannot stop crackers, so what is the solution

 bihar ke gopalganj jile ke barauli thana kshetra main shuukravaar ko ek bolero ke khadi bas se takaraa jane se pashcham champaran jile ke piparasi ke anchal adhikari (sio) kii ghatnasthal par hi maut ho gai jabaki bolero par savaar do anya log ghayal ho gaye
 According to the police, Manoj Kumar, who was posted as a Zone Officer at Piparasi in West Champaran, left for Bolero to Patna in the morning with an employee and driver
 gopalganj ke barauli thana kshetra ke banakat gaanv ke sameep ek bike savaar ko bachaane ke chakkar main chaalak kaa niyantran vaahan se hat gaya or sadak ke kinare khadi yatri bas se takaraa gai
 In this incident, the Bolero was completely damaged and Manoj Kumar, riding on it, died on the spot
 karmchaaree chunachun kumaar or chaalak gupran gambhir rup se ghayal ho gaye
 The injured have been admitted to the local hospital and the police is investigating the entire case
 shivanand tiwari ne bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 He says that Nitish works out of change and that is why he is being asked to contest the Lok Sabha elections
 shivanand kii maane to nitish kumaar ne unase apni khunnas to nikaali he saath hi shaabir ali or enke singh ko bhi loksabhaa chunaav ladane kaa farmaan dekar mushkil main daal diya
 Shivanand Tiwari mentioned these things in a letter to Bihar JDU President Vashistha Narayan Singh
 aaj tak ke paas shivanand tiwari kii chitthee kii exclusive copy he
 You also read that letter
 
 
 priy basishtha bhai,aaj ke akhabaaron main chunaav ladane ke sambandh main faisla karne ke liye mujhe ultimatum dene kii khabar aapke hawaale se chhapi he
 i am shocked by this news
 lagata he ki aapaki samaran shakti par umr kaa asar samay se pehle padane laga he
 On the night of 22nd January, around 9:30 pm, you had told me the order of Nitish Kumar that if i want to contest from Buxar, then i told you that i will not contest
 jo vyakti mujhe kaatane ke liye baaki do nirdosho kaa bhi rajyasabha kaa patta kaat de uske tikat par chunaav ladane kii morrkhtaa main kaise kar saktaa hum?meri baat agle din karpuri jainti ke dauraan sabit ho gai jab nitish ne apane bhaashan ke darmyaan chunauti bhare lahaze main kaha ki jo log kehete hai ki party kamjor he, ve chunaav ladakar dikhaayen
 The manner in which the party is being run, the party is getting weaker, only i said this in Rajgir camp
 to enke singh or sabir ali ko rajyasabha se kaat kar chunaav ladane ke liye kyon kaha ja rahaa he
 How can i think of contesting elections on behalf of a man who dislikes me to the extent of hatred, who can brutally slaughter two innocents to cut me off
 had to sabir ke maamle main hui he
 Ram Vilas ji had sent him to the Rajya Sabha
 uskaa to vahi turm samaapt ho rahaa he
 He will be sent again to the Rajya Sabha, on the condition that he came with us
 meri jaankaree ke anusaar, jo pakki he, pichhali baar nitish jab dilli aae the, bihar nivas main sabir or enke singh ke saamne jab kisi ne nitish se poocha ki sabir sahab kaa turm to samaapt ho rahaa he
 What will happen to them now? to nitish ne sabake saamne kaha tha ki sabir sahab dobaaraa rajyasabha jaaenge
 How Sabir has been exploited in the Delhi Assembly elections is known to many
 jisamen thodi bhi aadmiyat hogi vah uske saath is prakaar kaa vyavhaar kaise kar saktaa he
 i know very well that Nitish is asking me to contest elections not to win
 endie se jab humlog baahar nikle the usee samay maine nitish ko kaha tha ki main chunaav ladanaa chahta hum
 You fight - what was the problem at that time
 chunaav ladane kaa faisla sunaane ke liye shrikrishna memorial kaa manch kyon chunaa gaya
 The style and tone of the verdict was to win or to win the election? That is why, when you asked again the day after yesterday, i again refused
 phir yah ultimatum vaali baat kahaan se aa gayi
 Wonder
 aapkaa sathishivanand Oh God

 To get the economy out of the crisis, the Indian government is preparing a new strategy for different sectors in the next few weeks
 is bich udyog sangh asocham ne maang kii he ki sarkaar mandi kaa maar jhel rahe sectoron ke liye ek saal ke tex holiday kaa elaan kare
 The exercise to bring the economy back on track has begun
 sutron ne enditivi ko bataaya he ki pichley do hafton main vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne ahm stekholders se mulaakaat kii he
 Now the preparation is to take initiative on the demands of the recession hit sectors
 13 agast ko sankat jhel rahe NBFC sector main liquidity sudhaarney ke liye vitt mantralay ne ek nai skim kaa elaan kiya
 Options are being considered to relieve the Super Port Tax Surcharge to Foreign Portfolio Investors
 atomabile sector ne rivaaval package or jiesti 28% se ghataakar 18% karne kii bhi maang vitt mantri ke saamne rakhi he
 On the other hand, the industry association Assocham has demanded a 1-year tax holiday for the automotive, rear estate and manufacturing sectors
 asocham kii ye bhi maang he ki jiesti kii slab ghataakar sirf do rakhi jaaen 8% or 16%
 Saurabh Sanyal, Deputy Secretary General, Assocham, said that we demand that the government should declare a one-year tax holiday in the automotive sector, real state sector and textile sector
 pradhanmantri ke aarthik salaahkaar parishad ke adhyaksh bibek debaroy isi hafte jiesti kii daren ghataakar 3 karne kii vakaalat kar chuke hai - 6%, 12% or 18 pratishat
 And, along with the removal of corporate social responsibility and tax surcharge, have suggested to reduce government expenditure
 ab dekhnaa mahatvapurn hoga ki sarkaar kitni jaldi arthvyavastha ko dobaaraa majboot karne ke liye aage kya pahal karti he
 This was the period when revolutionaries were making all efforts to reduce the death sentence of Ram Prasad Bismil
 madanamohan malviya or asembli ke kuch anya sadasyon ne visarai se milakar praytn kiya tha ki mrityudand na diya jaae
 Still nothing happened and wires were sent to the jails
 jail suparitendent ne wo taar jab padhakar bismil ko sunaaya to bismil kii ankhon main koi dar nahin tha
 His autobiography records precisely the events of that period
 wo aatmakatha main likhte hai ki jab mujhe suparitendent jail ne taar sunaaya to maine bhi kah diya tha ki aap apana kaam kiijie
 But at the Superintendent's prison's over-all request to send a telegram to the Emperor for mercy, because he has kept a rule that on behalf of every hanged prisoner whose begging application is rejected by the Viceroy, He must send a telegram to the provincial government in the name of the emperor
 koi doosraa jail suparitendent aisa nahin karata
 While writing that telegram, i had some idea to appeal in privy-council England
 aage unki sabhi apilen or prarthana patr khaarij hue
 Bismil did not write this poem, know why he was involved in the Namakori incident, because the British had sentenced Ram Prasad Bismil to death on 19 December 1927
 swabhaav se bismil shaayari pasand the
 Poems always inspired him to revolution
 faansee ke takhte par bismil ne patna ke azimabad ke mashhoor shaayar bismil azimaabadi 'sarfaroshi kii tamanna ab hamaare dil main he' ke kuch sher padhe
 Since then, the identity of this entire najma became more than that of Ram Prasad Bismil
 ye thim wo line jo bismil ne padhinsarfaroshi kii tamanna ab hamaare dil main haidekhanaa he jor kitna baazu-e-kaatil main haikarta nahin kyun doosraa kuch baatcheet,dekhtaa hum main jise wo chup teri mehafil main haie shahid-e-mulk-o-millat main tere upar nisaar,ab teri himmat kaa characha gaiyr kii mehafil main havekt aane de bataa denge tuje i aasmaan,ham abhi se kya bataayen kya hamaare dil main haitihaas ko hamen darj karnaa hi hoga: bismilramprasad bismil ko aane vaale vakt kii aahat pehle hi mil chuki thi
 Only then he writes that our efforts have to be mentioned in the history of India
 vahiin wo bharat main kranti ko lekar likhte hai ki isamen bhi koi sandeh nahin he ki bharatvarsh kii rajnatik, dharmik tathaa saamaajik kisi prakaar kii paristhiti is samay krantikari aandolan ke paksh main nahin he
 The reason for this is that there is a lack of education among Indians
 ve saadhaaran se saadhaaran saamaajik unnati karne main bhi asamarth hai
 Then who should say about political revolution
 hindu muslim ekta par ye thi sochbismil hindu-muslim ekta par yakeen karte the
 He used to say that the government called Ashfaqullah Khan the right hand man of Ramprasad
 ashfakulla kattar musalmaan hokar pakke aryasamaji ramprasad kaa krantikari dal kaa haath ban sakate hai, tab kya naye bharatvarsh kii swatantrata ke naam par hindu musalmaan apane nijee chote- chote phaaydon kaa khyaal na karke aapas main ek nahin ho sakate
 This line is very popular among people even today
 bismil ke bare main ye bhi padhembachapan main ram prasad bismil aryasamaj se prerit the or uske baad ve desh kii aazaadee ke mishan se jud gaye
 After committing the Kakori incident, he was arrested and put on trial
 18 maheene tak mukadmaa chalaane ke baad 19 disambar 1927 ko gorakhpur jail main faansee de di gai
 Ram Prasad Bismil made a final request to the countrymen at the end of his autobiography
 'jo kuch karen, sab milakar karen or sab desh kii bhalaai ke liye karen
 All will be well with this
 ram prasad bismil kii aatmakatha ganesh shankar vidhyaarthee ne 'kakori ke shahid' ke naam se unke shahid hone ke baad 1928 main chhaapi thi
 Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who was prevented from meeting the family members of those killed in the shootout in Sonbhadra on Wednesday, spent the night at the Chunar Guest House not accepting the advice of the authorities to return
 priyanka or adhikariyon ke bich raat kareeb 12:00 baje se 1:15 baje tak chali duusare daur kii baatcheet bhi naakaam rahi or priyanka tathaa unke saikadon samarthak chunaar guest house main hi date rahe
 In a series of tweets late last night, Priyanka said that the Uttar Pradesh government sent Varanasi zone Additional Director General of Police Brij Bhushan, Varanasi's Divisional Commissioner Deepak Aggarwal and Deputy Inspector General of Police to tell me that i should return here without meeting the victims
 naa mujhe hiraasat main rakhane kaa aadhaar bataaya gaya he or naa hi koi kaagaj die gaye
 Priyanka Gandhi Vadra: Two relatives of victims have come here to meet me, 15 others are not being allowed to meet me
 Even i am not being allowed to meet them
 Bhagwan jane inki mansikta kya hai? Aap thoda dawab banayiya, unhe aana dijiye
 Mere pichhe pade hain

 maine spasht kar diya he ki main kisi dhara kaa ulanghan karne nahin balki peediton se milane ai hum
 i have told the messengers of the government that i will not go back without meeting them
 priyanka ne ek video bhi twit kiya he jisamen varisht prashasnic or police adhikari raat kareeb 1:15 baje unase baithak benatija khatm hone ke baad waapas jate dikh rahe hai
 Congress Legislature Party leader Ajay Kumar Lallu, present at the Chunar Guest House along with Priyanka and other supporters, told 'bhasha' on Saturday that the government was forcing them to leave the guest house by shutting off electricity and water supply but did not step back
 Will be removed unhone bataaya ki puri raat bijli nahin ai
 During this, Priyanka sat with the workers till about 4:30 in the morning
 sarkaar ne guest house main jalpan kaa koi intjaam nahin kiya
 Local citizens and party workers are making some arrangements
 maaloom ho ki congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi wadra ko sonbhadra main hue samuhik hatyakand ke peedit pariwaron se milane jane ke dauraan shuukravaar ko mirzapur ke adalhat kshetra main prashasan ne rokkar aparaadh prakriya samhita kii dhara 151 ke tahat hiraasat main le liya tha
 He was later brought to the Chunar Guest House
 prashasan ke aalaa adhikariyon ne unhen sonbhadra main dhara 144 lagu hone kii baat kehete hue waapas laut jane ko kaha lekin priyanka ne unhen jawaab diya ki vah akeli hi sonbhadra jaakar peediton se milane ke liye taiyaar hai
 In such a situation, no injunction will be violated
 unhone saaf kaha or vah unase mili bagaiyr waapas nahin jaaengi
 The stalemate that has started since then continues

 bharat main baaghon ko bachaane ke liye kade kadam uthaae gaye hai, iske baavjood is varsh ab tak kareeb 32 baaghon kii maut ho chuki he
 Of these, about 14 tigers fell prey to poaching
 mangalvaar ko yah jaankaree sansad ko di gai
 Union Forest and Environment Minister Jayanthi Natarajan told the Rajya Sabha that 14 out of 32 tigers were killed in poaching and 18 died naturally
 unhone bataaya ki avaidh shikaar kii rokthaam ke liye kai tarah ke upaay kiye jane ke baavjood abhayaarany ke bheetar do baaghon kaa avaidh shikaar kiya gaya jabaki 12 abhayaarany ke baahar mare
 Jayanthi told Parliament that since 2001, the country has lost 476 tigers
 inamen se 185 kaa avaidh shikaar kiya gaya or 291 kii swaabhaavik maut hui
 It is noteworthy that the census of tigers in the year 2010 stated that there are 1,706 tigers in the country
 maasoom ankhon or shararti muskaan se bharaa ek cheharaa darshakon ke dil main aise ghar kar gaya ki logon ko serial se zyada uske kirdaar kaa hi naam yaad rahaa
 The serial was 'valika Vadhu' and the character's name was 'anandi'
 or badi 'anandi' ke kirdaar main najar ainpratyusha banerjee, jo ki aaj duniya ko alavida kah chuki hai
 After Anandi's character, Pratyusha played many other roles in the industry but this character gave her a different identity
 kyonki unka yah kirdaar auraton ke atmasamman se lekar unke majboot hone kii kahani bayaan karata aayaa
 Similarly, Pratyusha's image was considered strong not only in reel life but also in real life
 phir chaahe unka camera ke saamne aakar police ke vyahaar ke khilaaf bolnaa yaa phir reality sho main apane panit par ade rahanaa, yah sab baaten ek strong or himmat rakhane vaali ladki kii ore ishaara karti hai, to akhirpratyusha ne aatmahatyajaisa kadam kyon uthaaya? aaie jaane pratyusha ke bare main kuch aisi baaten jinhen jaanakar aapako bhi lagegaa ki nijee jindagi main behad strong shakhsiyat thim pratyusha:apni sharton par jindagi jeene vaali pratyusha:pratyusha banerjeepane acting kariyar kii guidelins bhi khud banaaya karti thim
 If that work was not done according to them, she thought it better to leave that work
 ab yah unka adiyal vyahaar kaha jaae yaa unki shart, lekin wo aisi hi thim
 a recent example is when she was asked to expose on the set of the TV series 'der Sabko Lagta', Pratyusha went away from there
 dar sabko lagata' ke ek episod main unhen lead role mila tha
 But even before the camera was rolled, when she was asked to wear a dress exposing, she flatly refused and would leave the set
 vahaan sutron ke anusaar production house is maamle ko sulajhaate sulajh-te thak gaya lekin pratyusha ne apana iraadaa nahin badla
 This also made the entire crew angry
 pulisavaalon ke khilaaf shikayatpratyushane pulicekarmiyon ke khilaaf unke ghar par aakar unase badasluki karne kaa aarope bhi lagaaya tha
 Pratyusha openly narrated her tragedy in front of the camera
 dekhen pratyusha kaa ye andaaj:eks boyfriend kii badasluki ke khilaaf khadi huin:pratyushane bwoyfriend makrand malhotra ke khilaaf mumbai ke oshivara police stesan main shikaayat darj karwaai thi
 He accuses Makarand of misbehaving with him and his father, saying that his ex boyfriend has threatened to kill him
 media se kaha jo likhnaa he likho mere bare main nahin darati:pratyusha par mumbai ke ek hotel kaa aadha bill chuktaa naa karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 There were reports that Pratyusha paid half the hotel bill as cash and half as bill check
 lekin baad main wo chack bouns ho gaya
 When Pratyusha was asked about this, he denied all these allegations and told the media, "I am not afraid of anyone, write what i want to write about me, i don't mind
" pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bharat main hi do se teen switzraland banane kaa aahvaan karte huye somvaar ko switzraland ke udyogpatiyon se bharat main gharelu vinirmaan or kaushal vikaas ko badhaava dene par jor diya
 During this period, the Prime Minister held detailed talks with leading industrialists
 inamen abibi, laforge, novartis, nestle, rietter or roche aadi shaamil hai
 Addressing the round table meeting of industrialists, he told the Swiss watch industry that the diamond on his watches comes from Gujarat, so "I am fully sensitive to your concerns
" ’’ unhone udyogpatiyon evam vyavsaayiyon se kaha, ‘‘mere desh main do se teen switzraland banane kii jarurat he
 Therefore, there is a wide scope for participation
 ’’unhone kaha, ‘‘hamen vaishvik str kaa vinirmaan chaiye
 In such a situation, Switzerland's model of skill development will be very suitable for us
 ’’ With this, he said that India only 1
 25 arab logon kaa bazaar hi nahin he, balki hamaare paas kaushal bhi he or aisi sarkaar he jo ki udyog-dhandhon ke liye khulaa dimag rakhti he
 During this time their dialogue and discussions focused on ways to enhance trade cooperation between the two countries
 modi ne is dauraan udhyamiyon ko kaarobaar parivesh ko behatar banane or ise sugam banane kii sarkaar kii patibaddhta ke bare main bhi bataaya

 mujhe lagata he ki uski gendbaaji main koi samasya nahin he
 this is exactly

 kolhapur main in dinon do mahila police afasaron kii jodi khub charchaa main he
 The manner of their action against the miscreants is such that now people are getting to know them less than their name, but more than the name of Lady Dabangg and Lady Singham
 pile rang kii salwar-kameez main kolhapur kii adishnal espi yani badi madam jyotipriya singh hai or genes main hai shahar kii choti madam yani dspi vaishali maane
 Both of these officers now know the people of this city less than their names, but more than the names of Lady Dabangg and Lady Singham
 donon afasar pehle bike par or phir daud lagaakar manchalon or asaamaajik tatwon ko pakadati hai
 As soon as a boy tries to overtake them by racing, Madame's anger reaches the seventh sky directly
 pehle madam ke sipahasaalar ladke par haath saaf karte hai or phir choti madam bhi thappad jadkar apana gussa nikaalati hai
 In fact, in the city of Kolhapur in Maharashtra, for the last few days, there were many complaints about the road side Romeo and Shohed variety of boys in front of girls' schools and colleges
 kuch maamalon main to ladakiyon ke gharavaalon ne bhi police main chhedhkhani kii report di thi
 But the way the two officers of the Kolhapur police found out how to deal with such problems growing up around the schools and colleges was a little different
 ye tarika tha diarect ection yani sidhi karrwai kaa
 Both madams run on bikes, the younger DSP, the city's DSP Vaishali, holds the handle of the motorcycle, while the additional SP Sahiba Jyotipriya Singh, who handles the scarf, sits behind him
 jab donon bike par chalati hai to achaanak hi ladakon ke saamne afat banakar khadi ho jaati hai
 And then what good boys and what they want, whoever stumbles in connection with the question and answer, grab them and those who make the mistake of running away, they are destined again
 jab donon madam khud karrwai karne nikalati hai to phir lavajme kaa saath ho janaa lazimi he
 Hence, the police of several nearby police stations along with both depart on mission Majnu
 kai jagahon par karrwai karke takreeban 150 se zyada ladakon kii dharpakad ke baad mishan majanuun puraa hota he
 All the boys are interrogated and then released with warnings
 vaise kolhapur police kii is karrwai se manchalon kaa hausala kitna tuutegaa, ye to aane vaala vakt batayega, lekin philhal is karrwai ke dauraan khud police kaa kanoon kii andekhi karnaa bhi ek ahm sawaal he
 The pair of these officers of Kolhapur themselves kept the rules and regulations at bay
 awwal to unhone sarerah ladakon kii pitayee shuru kar di
 He also smashed the traffic rules from above
 yahi nahin, police aise ladakon ko bhi pakadakar peet daalati he, jo skool college ke aasapaas kisi anya kaam se bhi gaye hote hai
 Now the question arises whether going to any girls college or passing through it is a legal offense? If not, then in the presence of these policemen and especially additional SP Jyotipriya Singh, who gave DSP Vaishali Mane the right to publicly beat and jellify a boy? Obviously, the mob of school-colleges in the city cannot be justified
 can
 lekin acha maahaul banane ke chakkar main donon afasaron ne khud kai kanoonon kii andekhi kar di
 For example, the two set out on an action riding a helmet on a motorbike with a fancy number plate
 unke saath-saath baaki pulisavaalon ko bhi bike chalaate vakt helmet kaa khyaal nahin rahaa
 The separatist leader of Jammu and Kashmir, Muhammad Yasin Malik, opposed the entire township in the state for the displaced Kashmiri Pandits and termed it as a 'town of hatred'
 jammu evam kashmir libration front ke pramukh ne buudhvaar ko ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, 'ham aisi nafrat kii basti ko kabhi manjuuri nahin denge or iskaa purajor virodh karenge
 He, however, said that displaced Kashmiri Pandits have the right to return to the land of their ancestors
 unhone kaha, 'kashmiri pandit hamaare desh kaa abhinn hissaa hai
 Every leader who advocates independence requests them to return to their homes
 varisht hurriyat netaa saiyad ali gilaani ne bhi unase ghar waapas aane kii apil kii he
 'malik said,' Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed has married the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for the sake of power in Kashmir
 kashmiri panditon ke tathakthith samgr township ke liye mukhyamantri kaa grahamantri ko aashwaasan dena kashmir ko sampradayik hinsa kii aag main jhonkne kii ek badi sajeesh he
 He said that the state has a history of communal harmony and mutual co-existence
 unhone kaha, 'san 1947 main bhadke sampradayik dangon ke samay kashmir ghati main ek bhi alpsankhyak ko chuaa tak nahin gaya, jabaki jammu main hajaaron muslimon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 This is the real meaning of mixed culture
 ' malik ne kaha ki kashmir ghati main abhi bhi 10 hajaar se adhik kashmiri pandit muslaanon ke saath rah rahe hai
 He said that pandits have shops in the middle of the city and their customers are Muslims
 kya aap (sarkaar) unhen bhi usee township main basaayenge, jo vastav main ek yahudee basti ho jaaegi
 Malik said that the government's proposal would have serious consequences and against this proposal, he called for peaceful protest and strike on 10 April
 uttar pradesh ke mukhya sachiv javed osmani ne agle varsh elahabaad main hone vaale kumbh meley kii taiyaariyon se sambandhit sabhi vibhaagon ke adhikariyon ko nirdesh diya he ki sabhi kaam gunvattta purna tareeke se tay samay main puure kar liye jaaen
 Usmani, while reviewing the preparations of the fair, has instructed the principal secretaries and secretaries of all the departments concerned to visit the spot from time to time to inspect the work of their departments and ensure that the quality does not remain undiminished
 unhone ye nirdesh bhi diya he ki mukhya margon par atikaraman ko hataaya jaye or visthapiton ke punarvaasan kii bhi samuchit vyavastha kii jaye
 Usmani said that the repair work of all major routes should be completed by December 15
 unhone bataaya ki kumbh meley main paryatakon evam tirth yatriyon ko samuchit suvidha dene ke liye paryaton vibhaag ne 31 karod rupee kaa prastaav taiyaar kiya he

 Welcoming the move to expel senior leader Azam Khan from the party, Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh said on Sunday that the party would have suffered less in the Lok Sabha elections if this decision had been taken earlier
 khan ko party virdohi gatividhiyon ke chalate party se 6 saal ke liye nilambit kiye jane ke baad amar ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha 'main is nirnay kaa swaagat karata hum

 " The industry is not ready for reservation in the private sector
 asocham kaa kahana he- kaarobaar main mandi he, lihaaja aarakshan ke bare main sochna bhi mumkin nahin he
 The National Commission for Backward Classes has recommended 27 percent reservation for backward classes in the private sector this week
 nijee kshetra ke aise daftaron main kota lagu nahin hoga
 Assocham, the largest organization of Indian industries, says that it is not in a position to give new jobs
 isliye 27% rigerveshan kii baat hi sochna bekaar he
 Assocham Secretary General DS Rawat told NDTV, "it is not possible for the industry to even think of providing reservation in the current economic situation
 ham abhi rojgaar paidaa karne kii sthiti main nahin hai
 '' somvaar ko pichhadaa varg ayog ne sarkaar ko apni report saunpi he jisamen nijee kshetra main bhi aarakshan ke daayre ko failaane kaa suzav he
 The commission has recommended 27% reservation
 rashtriya pichhadaa varg ayog ke sadsy shakeel ansaari ne kaha, "hamane kaha he ki bajet satr ke dauraan sarkaar ko ek bill laana chaiye jisamen privet secteres main obisi samudaay ke liye 27 fisadi aarakshan kaa prastaav shaamil ho
 We want the government to talk to all parties on this proposal
 '' tippaniyan But seeing the tough attitude of the industries, it does not seem that they will be ready for any proposal for reservation
 ayog ne bhi ye haqiqat maani he ki ab tak sarkari kshetra main aarakshan ko thik se lagu nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 Reservation in India is not only economic but also social
 aarakshan kaa khul kar koi virodh nahin karata, lekin aarakshan ko lagu karne ko bhi koi taiyaar nahin hota
 The principle of diversity is also talked about, but overall the picture is still that neither the industry is ready for this nor the governments seem to emphasize this
 bhartiya udyogon ke sabase bade sanghathan asocham kaa kahana he, wo nayaa rojgaar dene kii haalat main nahin he
 So it is useless to think of 27% reservation

 We are not in a position to generate employment right now

 National Backward Classes Commission member Shakeel Ansari said, "we have said that during the budget session, the government should bring a bill which includes a proposal for 27 per cent reservation for the OBC community in the private sector
 ham chaahate hai ki sarkaar is prastaav par sabhi partiyon se baat kare
 '' Comments lekin udyogon kaa kadaa rukh dekhakar lagata nahin ki aarakshan ke kisi prastaav ke liye wo taiyaar honge
 The Commission has also accepted the fact that till now the reservation in the government sector has not been implemented properly

 Nobody opposes reservation openly, but nobody is ready to implement reservation
