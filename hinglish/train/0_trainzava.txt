 uniwarsity of huston ke bhautikavidon ne pani se hydrogen or oxigen alag karne kaa ek nayaa tarika nikaala he
 This method can be an effective way to produce clean hydrogen fuel in the future
 uniwarsity ne vijyapti main bataaya ki yah khoj pani se hydrogen nikaalane kii praathmik baadhaon main se ek ko dur karti he
 Paul CW Chu, one of the members of this team said, 'hydrogen is the cleanest primary energy source
 agar koi utprerak kii madad se pani main oxigen ke majboot bond se harakshejan ko alag kare to pani hydrogen kaa sabase prachur strot ho saktaa he
 Two reactions are required for each element to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen
 ’tippaniyan Obtaining an effective catalyst for the equation of oxygen fraction is the main problem, which researchers say they have now achieved
 yah utprerak louh metaphosphate or ek conductive nickel fom plateform kaa bana hota he
 Researchers say that the combination of these substances is more effective and less expensive than the current solution
 yah pareekshan main bahut zyada ticoupan bhi dikhaata he kyonki yah20ghante or10,000chakron ke baad bhi bina kisi pratikriya ke sanchalit hota he
 Using this new method means that hydrogen can now be produced without any carbon emission
 is dal ke sadasyon main se ek paul si dablyoo chu ne kaha, ‘hydrogen sabase svachh praathmik urja strot he
 Water can be the most abundant source of hydrogen if one separates hydroxygen from a strong bond of oxygen in water with the help of a catalyst

 anusandhankartaaon kaa kahana he ki in padaatharen kaa mishran maujuuda samay ke samaadhaan se zyada prabhavi or kam kharche vaala he
 It also shows very high durability in the test as it operates without any response even after 20 hours and 10,000 cycles
 is nae tareeke kaa istemaal karne kaa matlab yah he ki ab bina carbon utsarjan ke hi hydrogen utpaadit kiya ja saktaa he

 kendriya shahari vikaas mantralay necongress ko akbar road sthit mukhyalay khaali karne kaa notice bheja he
 24 Akbar Road i
e
 the headquarters of the All India Congress Committee has its own history
 is mukhyalay ne indira se lekar sonia tak kai utaar chadhaav dekhen hai
 Know 24 special things related to Akbar Road
 01
 This eight-room bungalow was built between 1911 and 1925 by Sir Edwin Lutyens
 congress mukhyalay banaae jane se pehle yah bangala indira gandhi ke kareebi or vafaadaar rajyasabha saansad ji
 The name of Venkateshwara was allotted
 unase pehle yah bangala do saal ke liye nehru ke daur main myamar ke rajdoot rahe nobel puruskaar praapt aang saan su kai ko aavantit tha
 The room in this bungalow, where Rahul Gandhi's office is, was very fond of the daughter of Su Kai because there was a big piñon there
 isi kamare main vah sangeet kii shiksha liya karti thi
 02
 aazaadee milane ke baad se congress kaa mukhyalay 7 jatanr mantar hua karata tha
 Later Indira Gandhi made Windsor Place her temporary party office, which was the deputy minister in the Nehru government
 ve
 It was the residence of Krishnappa
 vahaan se congress mukhyalay ko 5 rajendra prasad road le jaaya gaya
 And in 1978 the permanent office of the Congress was built at 24 Akbar Road
 03
 When 24 Akbar Road was chosen, the largest room in that bungalow was the dining-less living room
 jise congress adhyaksh karyaalay ke liye chunaa gaya
 At that time there was only one cane chair and small table in this room
 04
 The most special thing about the Congress headquarters is that one of its back doors is connected with 10 Janpath, which used to be the headquarters of the Youth Congress at that time and is now the residence of Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 05
 After the creation of the Congress headquarters, the bungalow grew from eight rooms to 34 rooms
 puure karyaalay parisar ko paanch hisson main vibhajit bhi kiya gaya he
 All Congress presidents from Indira to Sonia Gandhi made changes at the Congress headquarters
 kabhi kamare badaye gaye or kabhi toilet
 06
 mukhya bangale kii pichhali taraf bane darjanabhar kamaron kaa nirmaan narsimha raav ke daur main kiya gaya tha
 The office itself also houses the employees and their families
 in kamaron main sabhi buniyadi suvidhaayen maujuud hai
 But most of the later construction is illegal
 07
 There is a toilet attached in the chamber of the Congress President and his 11 General Secretaries
 lekin mahilaon ko 33 fisadi aarakshan dene vaali party ke mukhyalay main mahilaon ke liye koi shauchalay nahi hai
 In 1999, the rooms of the Congress Media Department were demolished as the offices of Congress Secretary Satyajit Gaikwad and Kumari Selja were built there
 08
 Rajiv Gandhi wanted to build a modern office on Rajendra Prasad Road for Congress in 1985-86
 unhone party ke sabhi saansadon se iske liye unke vetan se daan lene kii yojana banaai thi
 But everything changed with his death in 1991
 09
 In 1990, a hundred-year-old tree standing in the precincts of the Congress headquarters fell due to a severe storm
 jisaki vajah se ek aath saal ke bachche kii maut ho gai thi or party offis main bana ek mandir bhi kshatigrast ho gaya tha
 These temples and trees were special for ticket seekers
 mandir kaa nirmaan karnataka ke ek congress netaa ne tikat paane kii khushi main karaayaa tha
 10
 jab 2004 or 2009 main congress ko satta mili
 24 Akbar Road was considered auspicious for the Congress
 yahaan mukhyalay ban jane ke baad congress ne kai badi jeet dekhi lekin 2014 main congress ko ab tak kii sabase badi haar kaa saamana bhi isi daftar main baithkar karnaa padaa
 Sugarcane may cause bitterness for the government of Uttar Pradesh
 manamafik rate tay na hone se naaraaz pradesh kii 68 privet chini milon ne ganne kii perai band karne kii dhamkee de daali he
 However, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has instructed to start crushing in the mills of western Uttar Pradesh by 25 November and in other mills by 30 November
 lekin sugar lobby apni sharton par adi hui he
 Farmers are worried that if the mills do not run in time, the next crop of wheat along with sugarcane will be spoiled
 225 rupee se zyada dene ko taiyaar nahin sugar lobbymujaffarnagar dango ke baad upi sarkaar pehle se hi jat samudaay kii naaraazgi jhel rahi he
 At present, 40 lakh sugarcane farmers crop is ready in UP
 isamen kisaanon ke lagbhag 26 hajaar karod rupee fanse pade hai
 Crushing has already been delayed for a month and now the sugar mills have declared that they will not crush if they are forced to pay more than Rs 225 per quintal
 uttar pradesh chini mills association ke sachiv deepak guptara ne bataaya, 'hamane sarkaar se nivedan kiya he ki ganne kii maujuuda keemton yaa badi hui keemton par milen chalaanaa hamaare liye 2013-14 satr ke liye sambhav nahin he
 We have said that our payment capacity is Rs 225 per quintal
 agar sarkaar isse zyada bhugtan karnaa chaahati he to apane sansadhano se isaki purti kar de
 If the deadlock persists, there will be 101 private and 23 cooperative sugar mills in sugar prices
 pichley saal kul 23 hajaar karod rupee kaa ganna bhugtan tha jisamen chini milon par kisaanon kaa ab bhi 2300 karod rupee bakaayaa hai
 Sugar mills say that they also have a carryover stock of 8 million tonnes of sugar, due to which the prices of sugar are low in the market
 pichley saal ganne kaa nunatam samarthan mulya 280 rupee prati quintal tha, jisamen is saal 23 rupee kii badhotaree prastaavit he
 The sugar mills demand that the Uttar Pradesh government implement the recommendations of the Rangarajan Committee, in which it is said that sugarcane price should be linked to the market price of sugar
 jarurat padi to sadak par utrenge kisaanalekin kisaanon kaa kahana he ki sugar lobby munafa badhaanen ke liye dabaav kii ranneeti apana rahi he
 Kudhir Jagriti Manch president Sudhir Pawar said, "if they do not run the factory, then the price of sugar is sure to increase
" lekin mujhe yah lagata he ki yah dabaav kii ranneeti he
 They either want to start late or seek financial help from the central and UP government under pressure
 mil na chalane kii koi vajah nahin he
 50 lakh farmers are dependent on the mill
 26 hajaar karod rupaya fansaa hua he is fasal main
 Very few mill owners will say that we will not run the mill so easily
 kisaanon ke sadako par aane kii der he bas
 We feel that the day is not far when they will start getting abused
 'pavaar ne kaha ki unki maang he ki laagat mulya ke aadhaar par sarkaar jo munasib samajhe, keemat nirdhaarit karke turant mil chalavaai jaaen
 Today the cost which the state government or its university or institute has agreed is 251 to 257 rupees
 jald ghoshit hongi ganne kii keemten: sarkaarhalanki sarkaar ne is maamlen par abhi tak koi nirnay nahin liya he
 But the top officials of the government say that their first priority is to set the rate of sugarcane
 chini udyog va ganna vibhaag ke pramukh sachiv rahul bhatnagar ne kaha, 'bas hamaara aglaa kadam he keemten ghoshit karnaa
 Our sugarcane commissioners have held a meeting
 bahut sari milon ne hamen kaam shuru karne kii tareekhen likhakar di hai
 It is definitely that the big groups have not given it to them
 lekin sahakaari milen 25 november tak chal jaaengi

 dijal kii bikri par sarkari tel companiyon ko ho rahe ghate kii bharpai ke liye isaki keemten har maah 40 se 50 paise prati litre badhaai jaaengi
 The largest consumption of petroleum products in the country is diesel
 petroleum mantri em virappa moili ne patrakaron se kaha, aage kisi anya aadesh tak tel vipanan companiyaan dijal ke daamon main har maah 40-50 paise prati litre kii badhotaree kar sakati hai
 It is noteworthy that the government took the decision on January 17 to free diesel prices from government control

 Moily said that the decision to hike diesel prices a little per month will remain in force until the next order is issued
 haalanki unhone yah nahin bataaya ki tel companiyaan dobaaraa kab dijal kii keemten badhayengi
 By increasing the price of diesel, this step will save about Rs 12,907 crore of subsidy given by the government annually

 The comments moili ne kaha, hamen is masale par phir se vichaar karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 We have also heard this

 Instead of instructing the buses to fill diesel with petrol pumps, the state governments should reduce VAT and sales tax on diesel, so that it becomes cheaper

 dijal kaa daam badhaane se is kadam se sarkaar dwaara di jane vaali sabsidi kii kareeb 12,907 karod rupee salanaa kii bachat hogi
 But some wholesale customers have decided to buy diesel from petrol pumps like retail customers

 ' have been found
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne loksabhaa main aam bajet par hui charchaa kaa jawaab dete hue ukt ghoshnaa kii
 At the same time, he said that the government will not repeat the mistake of redistributing the existing resources without increasing the growth rate in the economy and by increasing the growth rate from 7 to 8 percent to make its resources so efficient that sufficient funds are provided for poverty alleviation and social security

 With this, the first phase of the general budget was completed
 jetali ne kaha, ‘hamen nivesh kii jarurat he
 We need domestic investment
 hamen antarrashtriya nivesh kii jarurat he
 Investment will generate employment, profit from investment
 nivesh aayega tab ham saamaajik suraksha ke kshetra main paisa laga sakenge
 If such an environment is not created, then there will be no investment and the country will become like a businessman, it will not be made of manufacturers
 ’ The Finance Minister said that some people have worked to disrupt investment, revenue, infrastructure, jobs and poverty alleviation by 'creating barriers' as their ideology
 hamen nivesh ke anukool maahaul bananaa he jisase hamaare paas buniyadi dhaanche, naukariyon or garibi unmoolan ke liye sansaadhan ho sake
 And when this happens, the country's economy will grow at a rate of 7 to 8 percent

 Even after this, it is not right to accuse us of being corporate favors
 unhone kaha ki abhi corporate kar 30 pratishat he jo vibhinn karkon ke shaamil hone par 34 pratishat ho jaataa he
 It is 34 per cent in appearance but we give so much leeway to the corporate sector that it is actually reduced to 23 per cent
 ham chhot ko dhire-dhire samaapt karenge or hamane corporate kar ko 25 pratishat karne kaa prastaav kiya he
 The Finance Minister said that we are not only competing for international investment but also for domestic investment

 Jaitley said that in the past the states had to look to the center for small things but the present government has worked to change this thinking and practice and it wants to pursue competitive federalism with cooperative federalism
 unhone kaha ki hamane kar dhaanche main rajyon kaa hissaa 10 pratishat badhaane ke 14wein vitt ayog kii sifarish ko sweekaar kiya he jiske baad puure desh ke kar basket main rajyon kaa hissaa badhkar 62 pratishat ho gaya he jabaki centre kaa hissaa 38 pratishat rah gaya he
 It is a redefined financial federal structure
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki iske jariye rajyon ke khate main 1
 86 lakh crores has been increased
 hamaara maananaa he ki rajya samrudh honge tab desh samrudh hoga
 Jaitley said that we have reduced the fiscal deficit in the next three years 4
 1 pratishat se kam karke 3 pratishat karne kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 Referring to agriculture sector, he said that attention has been given to various agricultural areas including irrigation so that agriculture sector can be developed
 agar bharat ko vikaas karnaa he tab krishi kshetra kaa vikaas jaruri he

 pashchim bengal ke purulia jile main sthit pandari gaanv ke liye ye jashn manaane kaa samay he
 After years of hurdles, the village is now lit up
 lekin khushi doguni tab hui jab gaanv waalon ko usase zyada mila jitna unhone sochaa tha
 Like many other villages in India, the village of Pandari adjacent to Ayodhya Hills was waiting for its share of power
 vikendrikrut saura urja kii sthapana se gaanv ke lagbhag 80 gharon kaa phayda hua he jo pehle aag jalaakar andhera mitaayaa karte the
 The NGO has set up the Solar Power Grid, a noble initiative under the Sri Sri Rural Development Program of an NGO named Art of Living
 isamen 72solar panelki madad se 2000 varg feet ke kshetra main 1
 The lights are being delivered through a 2 KW solar power grid
 isi gaanv ke kashinath kaa kahana he ki bazaar main mitti kaa tel 40 rupee litre bikta he
 The installation of solar lamps also saved us money
 saura urja se hamaari madad karne kaa dhanyavad
 Pallab Haldar, a member of the organization, benefited 80 homes, says that Purulia had a severe water crisis
 hamane dam ke paas solar pump lagaakar kheton tak pani pahunchane kaa kaam kiya
 We installed solar lamps and fans in 80 houses in the village
 sanstha kii nideshak shubhra roy ne bataaya, 'is gaanv ko chunane ke peeche sabase bada kaaran tha dam kaa hona
 Which does not dry up even during summer
 ham gaanvvaalon tak pump kii madad se aasaani se pani pahunchaa sakate hai
 So that he can grow the crop two to three times a year
 ham gaanv waalon ko alag alag tarah kii subjiyan ugane kii salaah de rahe hai
 ' rahul gandhi kaa america janaa, vahaan samvaad karnaa, team rahul kii bhavishya kii ranneeti kaa hissaa he
 Rahul's statements in America and answers to questions are indicating that in which direction his politics is going to go in the future
 rahul ne apane samvaad main party adhyaksh kii kursi ho yaa phir pradhanmantri pad kii ummidavaari donon kii hi taraf sanket de diya ki, vah taiyaar hai
 All this did not happen at all, behind this is the politics of Modi opposition, Nitish's separation and Rahul Gandhi's preparation for the future
 oktober main congress kii kaman sanbhaalenge rahul!rahul ne yah samvaad tab kiya jab yah tay he ki, congress party ke sanghathan chunaavon ke baad vah sonia gandhi kii jagah le lenge
 It is believed that in October, the Congress will be officially in the hands of Rahul
 isse pehle rahul apni chhavi durust karnaa chaahate hai
 Rahul Nehru wants to handle the legacy of Gandhi family but does not want to carry the burden
 yahi vajah rahi ki, rahul apane pita rajeev gandhi ke vakt hue sikh dangon par apni raay dete hai, khud ko peediton ke saath bataate hai or us ghatana ko galat qaraar dete hai
 At the same time, moving forward, Congress President also questions Sonia Gandhi's tenure
 jab vah kehete hai ki, 2012 ke baad congress ahamkaari ho gai to khud ko alag karte hai
 After all, everyone knows that it was only after 2012 that the UPA government maligned, all the allegations of corruption were leveled against him, due to which the party came to 44 in 2014
 piem kii ummidavaari se pehle vipaksh kaa nirvivaad netaa banane kii kavayad-darasal, rahul ke ranneetikaron kii nigaah sirf congress adhyaksh pad par nahin he
 Rather, before the candidature for the post of PM, Rahul has to be installed as the leader of the opposition instead of Sonia
 isiilie rahul ne pradhanmantri pad kii apni ummidavaari ke sidhe sanket bhi de die
 For this too, Rahul's strategists have made full preparations
 vah jaanate hai ki, congress vipaksh kii sabase badi party he or party ke netaa hone ke saath hi unako vipaksh ke netaa ke taur par baaki vipakshi dalon main sweekaarya hona hoga
 Rahul was in a dilemma while Nitish, now openly in the field - it is not hidden from anyone that Rahul was constantly confused while Nitish
 rahul ke karibiyon kii maane to rahul, nitish ke piem ke ummidavaar banane ke naam par khud ko peeche rakhane tak ko taiyaar the, lekin nitish kaa alag hona, baaki kshetreey dalon ke mukhiyaaon kaa badalanaa or badale vakt main rahul ko nai ranneeti ke saath saamne aane par majaboor kar gaya
 The story behind the attempt to make Rahul the main voice of the opposition in a changed situation - after all, Team Rahul believes that the political situation has changed across the country
 ab nitish modi ke saath he to tamaam rajyon main bhi kshetreey dalon kii kaman ab nai peedi par he, jisase rahul lagaataar sampark bana rahe hai or vah peedi rahul ko netaa maanane main parhez nahin karne vaali
 State-wise close to Rahul also discusses this
 rajyavar congress, rahul or kshetreey netaaon kii camestry-tamilnaduise rajya main diemke ke netaa karunanidhi kii umr or sehat ke chalate bagdor ab unke bete stallin ke haathon main he
 If sources are to be believed, this Stalin and Rahul have met continuously on several occasions and have also discussed about future politics
 bantwaaraa sidhaa he- tamilnadu main congress chota bhai to dilli main diemke chota bhai
 After leaving Biharnitish, the alliance between the Congress and Lalu is natural and both are helpless
 rahul ke ordinance faadane vaale kadam se lalu chunavi ladaai se baahar ho gaye
 Now Lalu is also doing politics for his sons
 vahiin rahul ko beton se parhez nahin he
 Lalu cannot contest elections due to Rahul
 aise main modi virodh ke naam par argedy rahul ke peeche khadi ho jaaegi to vahiin bihar main congress argedy ke peeche chal hi rahi he
 It is not a coincidence that just 1 day before Rahul's dialogue, RJD supremo Lalu Yadav tweeted - only the Congress can run the government of the country in a peaceful manner and people are realizing this
 saath hi sharad yadav ne rahul se mulaakaat karne ke baad hi modi or nitish ke virodh kaa bidaa uthaaya tha
 Therefore, Sharad Yadav also has no problem in coming with Rahul
 jharkhandamobesh yahaan bhi halaat kuch vaise hi hai
 Shibu Soren, leader of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, has handed over the command of the AAP to his son Hemant Soren and Hemant too has no objection to Rahul's patronage in the politics of the Center
 kuch aisa hi jharkhand vikaas morcha ke mukhiya babulal marandi ke bhi saath he, vakt aane par vah vipaksh ke gathbandhan kaa hissaa bane to rahul ke peeche khadey hone main unako koi etraj nahin
 The Congress has been marginalized in the state after the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh
 lagaataar congress ke ranneetikaar koshish kar rahe hai ki, kabhi congress ke rahe jaganmohan reddy congress main laut aaen yaa congress ke saath gathbandhan kar len
 The Congress hopes that if the matter is built, then both will be together on Jagan in the state and Rahul's talk in Delhi
 bengalsipiem netaa seetaram yechuri or rahul gandhi haal ke dinon main ek duusare ke kaaphi kareeb aae hai
 Yechury has no problem standing with Rahul in the face of Modi opposition
 vahiin, congressi ranneetikaar kehete hai notebandi ke vakt bhi rahul or congress kii bulaai press conference main mamata banerjee ne aana sweekaar kiya tha
 That is why there will be no problem in the future also
 haalanki, congress ke saamne rajya main badi dikkat he kii, ek duusare ke virdohi makapa or trinmul congress ko ek saath manage karnaa
 Uttar Pradesh where Samajwadi Party is now not of Mulayam but of Akhilesh
 saath hi akhilesh rahul kii dosti or saajha siyasat kisi se chhipi nahin he
 Congress strategists say that in the current political situation, the compromise of seats for the fight for its existence and the right proposal for the future, gahega-bahay Mayawati will also fall in this court
 maharashtrahaal ke dinon main ensipi ke endie main shaamil hone kii ghatnaon ne congress ko baichaiyn jarur kiya he
 But the strategists believe that, if Sharad Pawar's NCP preferred to support the opposition in the politics of Modi opposition and secularism, Sharad Pawar's health and age would lead to his daughter Supriya Sule in national politics and his nephew Ajit Pawar in the state 
 aise main supriya ko rahul kii saraparasti se etraj nahin hoga or zarurat padane par sharad pavaar kabhi bhi sonia gandhi se charchaa kar sakate hai
 Overall, Team Rahul has now decided that, if he has to confront Modi, first he will have to take command of the Congress, then will have to lead the opposition parties together and become the Prime Ministerial candidate in 2019
 isi disha main kadam badhaate hue rahul ne party adhyaksh banane kii baat kah di to 2019 ke lihaaj se pradhanmantri kii kursi kaa ummidavaar banane kaa bhi elaan kar diya
 The team between these two wants to complete Rahul Rahul slowly
 wo safar he, sonia gandhi kii jagah khud rahul kaa vipaksh kaa sweekaarya netaa bananaa
 Putting the strategy on the ground, Rahul's challenge is simple: Rahul will become the President of the Congress Party
 There is no challenge
 congress party kii ore se 2019 ke liye pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ghoshit ho jaaenge, isamen bhi chunauti nahin he
 Actually the real challenge is to become the leader of the opposition, which all the opposition parties should accept
 kyonki team rahul bhi jaanati he ki, aaj ke daur main modi or bijepi se takaraane ke liye congress akele kaaphi nahin he, vipaksh ko ekajute hona hoga
 That is why Rahul, who is seen in confusion till now, has openly declared future politics
 rahul or unki team ko yaad rakhana hoga ki, ranneeti bananaa aasaan he, usko zamin par utaarna mushkil
 At the same time Rahul may gather with the leaders of the opposition, but the real challenge will be to get the support of the public
 maharashtra bijepi kii netaa pankaja munde (pankaja Munde) somvaar ko aurangabad (aurangabad) main party kii kshetreey baithak ke dauraan anupasthit raheen
 It is said that she has been angry since the defeat in the assembly elections held on October 21
 rajya bijepi ke adhyaksh chandrakant patil ne kaha ki vah swasth mahasoos nahin kar rahi thim, jis kaaran purv anumati se vah anupasthit raheen
 Patil told reporters, "I had talked to Pankaja Munde before coming to Aurangabad for the meeting
 vah biimaar hai
 However, preparations are on for the December 12 rally
 purv anumati se vah anupasthit raheen
 The senior BJP leader said he would meet him two days later at Parli in Pankaja's Beed district
 bijepi ke divangat netaa gopinath munde kii beti pankaja ne maharashtra main ‘‘badali raajnneetik paristhitiyon'' main apni bhavi raajnneetik yatra ke bare main soshal media par post daalkar khalabali machaa di thi
 He also removed the word "BJP" from his Twitter handle, leading to speculation about his future in BJP
 haalanki baad main pankaja ne spasht kiya ki vah bijepi nahin chhod rahi hai or dal badalanaa unke khun main nahin he
 Anna Hazare has justified his response given after the incident of slapping Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar, saying neither he is Gandhi nor Pawar was the slap violence
 anna ne apane taaja blog main kaha he ki unki tulana mahatma gandhi se karnaa thik nahin he, kyonki vah mahatma gandhi ke paas bhi baithne ke kaabil nahin hai
 He said that he definitely considers Gandhiji as an ideal, but sometimes he also puts forward Shivaji's ideal
 anna ne pavaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki bhrasht logon ko bachaane kii pavaar kii bahut puraani aadat he
 He also said that Pawar's supporters gave him dirty abuses, which he has recorded and now he will play them and tell it to the public
 is bich, anna 10 disambar ko dilli ke liye ravaanaa honge or 11 disambar ko unka jantar-mantar par ek din kaa dharna dene kaa iraadaa he
 Due to backache, doctors have advised him to rest, but Anna will ignore this advice and go to Delhi
 unke samarthan main ralegan siddhi ke logon ne bhi ek din ke anshan kaa faisla kiya he
 Anna Hazare wants to invite the leaders of all parties to an open debate on the Lokpal at Jantar Mantar, but no political party has so far openly expressed its opinion on it

 After the current NDA government adopted the previous UPA government's stand in the Supreme Court, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today said that the agreement made by the then government with Germany in 1995 to disclose the details of black money stashed abroad is a hindrance

 Jaitley said, "if the question is whether the Modi-led NDA government is not willing to make some names public for some reason, then the answer is no
" 
 We have no problem in making the names public, but they can be made public only through due process of law
 ' He told reporters, "and the DTAA (double Taxation Avoidance Treaty) is becoming a hindrance to this lawful process of law which was signed on June 19, 1995 between the government of Germany and the then Congress Party

 Today is Tuesday, Devshayani Ekadashi
 puranic kathaon ke anusaar aaj se thik chaar maheene ke liye srihir vishnu pataal lok main sone chale jate hai
 Then after four months i
e
 Kartik wakes up on Shukla Paksha Ekadashi
 srihari
 
 
 
 isliye chaar maheene tak koi bhi shubh kaary nahin kiye ja sakate
 Importance of Devshayani Ekadashi Ekadashi of Shukla Paksha of Ashadh month is called 'devshayani Ekadashi'
 is ekadshi se agle chaar maah tak srihari vishnu yoganidra main chale jate hai
 Therefore, it is forbidden to do anything auspicious for the next four months
 devshayni ekadshi se hi chaturmaas kii shuruyaat bhi ho jaati he
 This Ekadashi also stops the tour of ascetics, these days only Braj can be visited
 chaar maheene baad milegi srihari kii kripaaaj se thik chaar maheene tak nahin milegi srihari kii krupa or unki krupa ke bina koi bhi shubh karm safal nahin ho saktaa he
 Therefore, one should avoid doing any auspicious work as long as Srihari Yoga is in sleep
 lekin devshayni ekadshi yoga nindra main srihari se manachaaha vardaan maanga ja saktaa he
 What is the secret of the yoga sleep of Srihari Vishnu, according to the stories once King Bali was proud of his power and wealth
 tabhi srihari vishnu ne bali kaa ghamand todane ke liye vaaman rup liya
 Shri Hari asked for three steps as donation from Bali in Vamana form
 pehle hi pag srihari ne sabhi dishaao sahit sampurna prithvi or akaash ko naap liya
 In the second step, the Lord measured the heaven
 srihari ne teen pag main napa sara sansamb teesraa pag rakhane ke liye kuch bhi baaki na bachaa to bali ne apana sir aage karte hue nivedan kiya ki prabhu apana teesraa pag mere shish par rakhie
 Pleased with this sacrifice, Lord Vishnu made Bali the king of Hades and asked for a boon
 bali ne kaha prabhu aap sadaiv mere mahal main rahen
 Now Lord Vishnu was tied in sacrifice
 aise main mata lakshmi ne bali ko anpa bhai banaakar usase bhagwaan ko vachanamukt karne kaa anurodh kiya
 Srihari resides at Vishnu Patal for 4 months from the same day
 iske baad mahashivaratri tak bhagwaan shiv or shivaratri se devshayni ekadshi tak brahma ji bali ke pataal lok main nivas karte hai
 Does Srihari really sleep on Devshayani Ekadashi? There are many types of confusion and apprehensions among people about Devshayani Ekadashi
 isliye aaj ham aapako srihari kii yoga nidra kaa sach bataane vaale hai
 Does Srihari really sleep on Devshayani Ekadashi
 hari or dev kaa arth tej tatv se bhi he
 During this time, the sun, moon and nature's intensity decreases, that is why it is said that God has fallen asleep
 tej tatv yaa shubh shaktiyon ke kamjor hone par kiye gaye kaaryon ke parinaam shubh nahin hote or shubh kaaryon main baadha aane kii ashanka bani rahati he
 Therefore, it is forbidden to do auspicious work for the next four months from Devshayani Ekadashi
 devshayni ekadshi par bhale hi srihari yoga nidra main chale jate hai lekin is din unki krupa se aapako kai vardaan bhi mil sakate hai
 One can get blessings on Devshayani Ekadashi
 One can get rid of collective sins and problems on Devshayani Ekadashi
 durghatnaon ke yoga tal jate hai or vyakti kaa man shuddh hota he
 After this Ekadashi, there is a feeling of newness in body and mind
 kitna divya din he aaj
 
 
 
 is din srihari kii vishesh puja –upasna se aapaki har kaamana puri ho sakati he

 kris gail ne vishwa cap main pehla doharaa shatak jadne ke baad gendbaaji main bhi apana jalawaa dikhaaya jisase westeindies ne pool bi ke match main zimbabwe ko dakworth louis padvati se 73 ran se haraakar lagaataar duusari jeet darj kii
 Gayle, who was hit by critics for his poor form, scored 215 runs off 147 balls, which included ten fours and 16 sixes
 unhone malaren sampuls (naabad 133) ke saath duusare wicket ke liye ekadivasiy antarrashtriya cricket kii record saajhedaari nibhaai jisase westeindies ne pehle ballebaaji karte hue do wicket par 372 ran kaa vishaal score banaaya
 Zimbabwe, however, showed resilience but under pressure from the big target, his team 44
 3 over main 289 ran par out ho gai
 The rain came in early in the Zimbabwe innings, forcing the game to stop midway
 baad main do over kam kar diye gaye or zimbabwe ke liye 48 overon main 363 ran kaa lakshya tay kiya gaya
 For Zimbabwe, Sean Williams (76) and Craig Irwin (52) hit the West Indies in the middle with a half-century as the Caribbean team failed to defend a score of over 300 against Ireland in their first match
 wicketiper ballebaaj brandan tailor ne bhi refral ke kaaran wicket ganvaane se pehle 37 ran kii aakshark pari kheli
 But today the name of Gayle was written
 jinhone ballebaaji main kai nae record banane ke baad gendbaaji main bhi kamaal dikhaaya or chah over main 35 ran dekar do wicket liye
 Captain Jason Holder and Jerome Taylor also took three wickets each
 westeindies kii yah teen maichon main duusari jeet jabaki zimbabwe kii itane hi maichon main duusari haar he
 Gayle played this innings when the West Indies won the toss, batting first and losing the wicket of Dwayne Smith (zero) on the second ball itself
 gail pari kii aakhri gend par out hue
 He set a new ODI record by sharing 372 runs for the second wicket with Samuels
 isse pehle kaa record tendulkar or dravid ke naam par tha jinhone 1999 main newjiland ke khilaaf hyderabad main 331 ran jode the
 The left-handed batsman got off to a slow start but eventually his West Indies managed to score 195 runs in the last 13 overs due to his stormy attitude
 inamen se 152 ran aakhri das overon main bane
 Gayle completed the first 50 runs off 51 balls while he faced a 105th ball to reach a century
 yah vanade main unka 22waan shatak he
 He then hit the next Pachasa on just 21 balls and then soon surpassed his previous highest score (153 not out)
 gail ne 150 se 200 ran tak pahunchane ke liye keval 12 gend kheli or 138 gendon par apana pehla doharaa shatak puraa kiya
 He has become the first batsman in the world to score triple in Tests, double in odis and centuries in T20
 gail ne spinner tafadajava kaamungoji ke ek over main do chaukon or do chhakkon kii madad se 21 ran batore or phir seen williams ke agle over main teen chakke jadkar vishwa cap or westeindies kii taraf se vanade main sarvaadhik score kaa nayaa record banaaya
 Gayle completed his double century by sending Tendai Chatara for four runs
 westeindies kii taraf se isse pehle vanade main sarvocch score kaa record viv richards (189) ke naam par tha
 At the other end, Samuels struggled to score runs from the beginning but later took a few good shots after taking a lesson from Gayle
 sampuls ne 95 gendon kaa saamana karke apana ardhashatak puraa kiya tha
 He played a total of 156 balls in his unbeaten innings and hit 11 fours and three sixes
 unhone pari ke 49wein over main penyangra par 22 ran batorkar apana strike rate sudhara
 Zimbabwe did not have a good start and at one time their score was 46 for three
 iske baad williams or tailor ne keval 12 over main duusare wicket ke liye 80 ran jode
 Williams later also shared a 51-run partnership with Irvine but then lost wickets at regular intervals
 rashtramandal khel aayojan samiti ke adhyaksh suresh kalmari ne guuruuvaar ko is baat ko nakaar diya ki naukarshahon kii samiti gathit karke sarkaar ne unke par katar diye hai
 He said that he is still a bass and the committee has been formed on his request
 kalmari ne is baat par kadi pratikriya vyakt kii ki samiti ke gathan kaa matlab unke adhikaron main kami karnaa he
 He said, 'the news report said that ten bureaucrats have been appointed but these appointments have been made on our request
 aayojan samiti ne pradhanmantri manmohan singh se aagrah kiya tha ki khelon kaa antim charan shuru ho gaya he or sarkari adhikariyon kii madad kii jarurat he
 'kalmadi said,' they are coming for cooperation

 Every time you say that Qatar has been given on Kalmadi
 main aapako bataa dena chahta hum ki main pehle payalat tha
 ' bhrashtachar or blike mani par ankush lagane ke liye centre sarkaar ne 500 or 1000 ke maujuuda noton kaa chalan band karne kaa elaan kar diya he
 Now 500 and 2000 new notes will come in their place
 500 or 1000 ke puraane note aadhi raat se avaidh ho jaaenge
 These can be deposited in banks or post offices
 iske liye 50 dinon kii samaysima tay kii gai he
 This decision of the Central Government will have far-reaching consequences
 is faisle kaa asar un logon par padegaa jinhone apni blike mani cash ke taur par rakhi hui he
 Because after 30 December 2016, these notes will have no value
 is faisle se deshbhar main chal rahe sabhi jaali noteek jatke main bekaarho gaye
 This has also caused a major setback to the funding of elections and it will definitely have an impact in the assembly elections in Punjab and UP
 dekhen photo: ab is kaam ke hajaar-paanch sau ke notehalanki, sarkaar ke is faisle ne kaale dhan kii jamkhori karne waalon ko apnikali kamaiko thikaane lagane ke liye nae or anokhe tareeke izaad karne par bhi majaboor kar diya he
 16 as of 31 March 2016
 5 lakh karod kaa kaala dhan desh main tha
 Most of this amount was deposited in the form of currency notes, which was black money deposited through corruption or 'cash transactions only'
 sarkaar ke taaja faisle ke baad wo log hi 30 disambar 2016 takbainkon main bade note jamaa karneki himmat juta paaenge jin logon ne kanoonee tareeke se paise kamaaye hai
 The condition of people who have made money illegally will be worsened as these notes will be sold at the end of deadline
 is faisle se un logon par kya asar hoga jinke paas athaah blike mani he
 They will try first to buy gold with these money
 dedline khatm hone tak sona or nivesh ke aise sadhano kii maang bad jaaegi
 But what will happen after that
 sarkaar deshbhar main sone kii bikri par ankush lagaaegi
 Property prices will fall due to the latest government decision
 kyonki desh main adhiktar property cash ke jariye kharidi jaati he jo blike mani kii khep ke jariye aati he
 It is estimated that about half of the property's business is based on black money and benami transactions
 rigerv bank ke mutabik desh main chal rahe noton main 45 fisadi 500 rupee ke hai jabaki 39 fisadi 1000 rupee ke hai
 At present, 16 billion 500 rupee notes and 6 billion 1000 rupee notes are in circulation
 is tarah sarkaar ne ek jatke main 84 fisadi noton ko band kar diya he
 That is why banks and atms across the country had to announce to be closed for two days
 500 or 1000 ke puraane note badalane or inaki jagah 500 or 2000 ke nae note laane ke liye rigerv bank ko 10 hajaar karod rupee atirikt kharch karne pad sakate hai
 There is also speculation of large currency like 5000 and 10,000 notes
 haalanki, blike mani jamaa karne kii hode kii ashanka ke maddenjar sarkaar ne is tarah ke prastaavon ko thande baste main daal diya he
 According to an estimate, black money in our country can be anywhere from one-quarter to 2-3 times of our GDP
 aise main blike mani par ankush lagane ke liye sarkaar kaa yah bada faisla he
 But this note closure case is not the first in the world
 isse pehle is saal european central bank ne kaha tha ki wo 500 euro ke note band karne par vichaar kar rahaa he
 In the US, there is a ban on the issuance of new $ 100 bills
 2010 main 2
 One dollar bills worth $ 6 billion were destroyed
 duniya main karency nasht karne kii yah ab tak kii sabase badi ghatana thi

 The Janata Dal United candidate has never been defeated since 2005, whether Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal United candidate may be Manzar Alam or Sarfaraz Alam, who is now an RJD MP from Araria
 2
 This time RJD has nominated Shahnawaz Alam, son of former MP Taslimuddin and now younger brother of RJD MP Sarfraz Alam
 jahaan tasalimuddin chah baar is seat se chunaav jite vahiin sarfaraaj do baar vidhayak or do baar janata dal ummidavaar manzar alam se parajeet bhi hue

 is baar is seat se janata dal ummidavaar murshid alam bhi purv vidhayak or ab saansad sarfaraaj alam kii tarah kai maamalon main aaropee hai, jinamein balaatkaar, murti chori or hatya ke prayaas jaise maamle hai

 janata dal united ke rashtriya adhyaksh nitish kumaar ko is baat kaa andaaza tha ki ummidavaar ke chayan main kahin na kahin party se galati hui he isliye brihaspativaar ko jab ve prachaar ke liye jokihat aae to unhone kaha ki ummidavaar ke chayan main sthaneey logon kii raay or sahyogi dalon ke netaaon ke saath vimarsh kiya gaya tha

 The majority of Muslim voters say that it is not possible to expect major reversal from the Lok Sabha by-election

 is baar rajd ne purv saansad tasalimuddin ke bete or ab rajd saansad sarfaraaj alam ke chote bhai shahanvaaj alam ko ummidavaar banaaya he
 While Taslimuddin won the elections from this seat six times, Sarfaraz was also defeated twice by MLA and twice by Janata Dal candidate Manzar Alam
 3
 This time Janta Dal candidate from this seat Murshid Alam is also accused in many cases like former MLA and now MP Sarfaraz Alam, in cases like rape, idol theft and attempt to murder
 4
 Janata Dal United national president Nitish Kumar was aware that somewhere in the selection of the candidate there was a mistake from the party, so on Thursday when he came to Jokihat for campaigning, he said that the local people opinion and the selection of the candidate Discussions were held with the leaders of allies
 5
 This time the contest is triangular but RJD seems to be confident of its victory on the basis that RJD got eighty thousand votes from Jokihat Assembly in the by-election for Araria Lok Sabha seat held two months ago
 yah antar kam ho saktaa he lekin haar main filhal nahin badal saktaa
 Also read: Nitish Kumar named accused of rape and idol theft! 6
 At the same time, the leaders of Janata Dal United are claiming victory on the basis that while Muslim voters will be divided in this Muslim-dominated area, Hindu voters will be mobilized in support of their candidate
 lekin ve maanate hai ki agar muslim yadav ekajute rahe to phir ye daawa hawa hawaii ho saktaa he

 Although he does not have any resentment with Nitish Kumar, it is his compulsion to vote for RJD with the BJP, especially in front of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 10
 In the last two days, rjd's campaign will be on the shoulder of Tejashwi Yadav and if he manages to defeat Janata Dal United on this seat, then surely his stature will increase in party and state politics

 kanpur ke pandunagar ilaake main rahane vaale piyush shyaam desani 26 july kii raat apni patni jyoti ke saath khaanaa khaane shahar ke ek restaurant gaye the
 After having dinner, Jyoti was insisting to go on a long drive at night
 piyush ne pehle to jyoti kii baat ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 But then in order to keep his wife's heart, he agreed to her
 raat ke andhere main wo apni car ko shahar kii sadakon par kisi aane vaale khatre se anjaan chalaate ja rahe the
 Piyush and Jyoti were unaware that something untoward was going to happen to them

 Before Piyush could understand anything, the boys took him off the car and started beating him up
 lekin wo itane par hi nahin ruke
 After this, he forcibly abducted Piyush's wife Jyoti sitting in the car and escaped from there with his car
 police harakat main aadapni patni kaa apharan hone ke baad piyush ne fouran police ko is haadase kii jaankaree di
 Since the matter was related to a big businessman of the city, the police also reached an opportunity in a hurry
 iske baad police ne puure shahar kii nakebandi kar ilaake kii combing kerani shuru kar di
 After a long time, the police did not manage to find Jyoti or those abusers
 iske baad raat ke 2 baje shahar ke panaki ilaake se ek mahila ke shav milane kii khabar ai
 When the police identified the body, it was found that the corpse was lit
 jyoti ke jism par kareeb dedh darjan ghaavkidanap karne ke baad badmaashon ne badi hi berahami se jyoti kaa katl kiya tha
 According to the postmortem report, about one and a half dozen wounds were found on Jyoti's body
 badmaashon ne chaaku se jyoti ke pet par chaar waar, uski gardan par chaar waar, sir ke pichley hisse par do waar, uske pairon par chaar waar or qamar par do waar kiye the
 Not only this, the finger in which Jyoti was wearing a diamond ring
 badmaash uski wo ungali kaat kar apane saath le gaye
 But the surprising thing is that apart from this the crooks did not even touch the jewels which Jyoti was wearing
 yahaan tak kii badmaash jyoti kaa mahangaa mobile bhi uski gaadi main hi chhod gaye
 By chance, the police got three knives in the name of a clue
 jinhen jyoti ke kaatil katl karne ke baad vahaan chhod gaye the
 The police did not find any success in the initial investigation, but one thing is certain that the way the murderers carried out the incident
 usase ye baat to saaf he ki unka makasad lutpaat kaa nahin tha
 He kidnapped Jyoti with the intention of killing him
 shaq kii sooyee jyoti ke pati piyush shyaam desani paramangalvaar ko jyoti murder cese main police ne kuch chaunkaane vaale khulaase kiye
 The needle of suspicion rests on Jyoti's husband Piyush Shyam Desani
 tafteesh ke dauraan police ne piyush ko hiraasat main le liya or usase poochtacha kii gai
 According to the police, during the dinner on Sunday night, Piyush's mobile was constantly receiving SMS from a girl and he was also responding to them
 isi baat ko lekar restaurant main donon kii bahes bhi hui
 Then after the dinner was over, both of them had a fight outside the restaurant
 iske baad wo donon drive par nikal gaye
 Meanwhile, he was attacked by some miscreants
 jyoti ko jabaran gaadi main bitha kar uskaa apharan kar liya tha
 a woman friend of Piyush was also in custody, according to police sources
 Jyoti tried to escape from her murderer
 isi dauraan unamem se ek kaatil ke bal uski mutthi main aa gaye
 At present, the police has sent these hairs for investigation
 sutron ke mutabik police piyush kii us mahila dost kaa pataa laga chuki he or usne poochtacha ke liye use bhi hiraasat main le liya he
 On the other hand, Jyoti's father Shankar Lal suspects his son-in-law, Piyush
 philhal police ne kisi ko bhi clinit nahin di he or maamle kii tafteesh kar rahi he
 But until she can find answers to all the questions related to the Jyoti Murder Case, she will not be able to cover the secret on that matter

 The wife got a call after seeing the news on TV
 usne kaha, 'turant waapas aa jaao
 We have been fooled

 Organized the program and despite everyone's request i stayed out of Jaipur District Executive
 ek achche rajnatik vikalp kaa buniyadi dhaancha apane jile main ban jaae yahi tak maine apni bhoomika sochi thi
 After that, i will also remember the meeting that took place in Kaushambi office after 2 months, when Manishji told me, 'good people run away from their responsibilities and then complain that politics is dirty
 aapako jimmedaari leni hogi dow sahab
 a few days later he came to Jaipur to form the state executive
 mere ghar ruke or phir unheen bhavuk tarkon ke saath mujhe rajasthan sachiv kii jimmedaari saunp di
 During the same meeting in Kaushambi office, i had said to you both, 'I am a soldier of the freedom struggle, i will not commit slavery even to my general
 ' mere tevar to aapane us din hi bhaanp liye honge
 If we had to work, why would we struggle so much? Have we come today to make our future in politics, only the people who have done the work are needed? Those who do not ask questions? Read further, when Parikh brought the signature of 12 thousand people

 There were also 22 candidates, but you also know that i never had the desire to contest elections myself

 Preparing them to contest elections
 yadi ham maan le kii ham hi sabase achche hai to hamaari khoj khatm ho jaaegi
 Even in the meetings of the National Executive, i made several proposals that people in responsible positions in the union should not contest elections
 or dekhie ye raajnneeti hamen kaha le ai? chunaav ladane kii, mantri banane kii ichha rakhana sahi he, lekin sawaal poochna galat?aaj shanti bhushan ji jaise varisht sadsy kaa khule aam apmaan ho rahaa he
 At the age of 80, does not that ordinary member of the party have the right to express his opinion? In Article VI a (a) iv of the Constitution, we have written that every member of the party (who does not hold responsible positions) will have the right to put his opinion on the public platform
 hamane ek aisi party banaai thi, jisamen kisi bhi saadhaaran sadsy ko sonia gandhi yaa narendra modi ke vichaaron se asahmat hone kaa adhikaar ho
 The elder sitting with the hope of clean politics for a lifetime saw a ray of hope at the last stage of his age
 main jaanata hum ki unki ankhon main aankh daalkar aap wo nahin kah sakate jo 'aap' ke pravaktaa tivi par kehete hai
 Will those of different opinions in our party now be called traitors? You had brought the signature of 12 thousand people
 nivedan karne kii aap suraksha lijie
 You said, 'one of the goals of this movement is to eliminate fear from the minds of the people
 wo bolne kii himmat juta saken
 'but the reality is that today there is fear in telling the truth
 soshal media par bani hui fouj us vyakti ko doshi nahin maanati jo party ke andruni email ek sajeesh ke tahat li kare yaa party ke hi puraane kaaryakartao ke khilaaf sajeesh kar jhuthe SMS bhej unhen badnaam kare
 But at a time when you are the uncrowned king of the politics of the country, you have the courage to question him, he is known as a traitor, a traitor and by what names
 kya ham vastav main ek bhay mukt samaaj bana rahe hai?main rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main aapse ye sawaal bina bhay karata aayaa hum ki kya 'aap' yani sirf aravind kejariwal hai? kya desh maane sirf dilli he? aapke saamne yah sawaal rakhane kaa saahas to hameshaa tha, lekin aaj yahi sawaal poochna to deshadroh se bhi bada aparaadh ban gaya he
 When we formed the party, the slogan was 'aam Aadmi Zindabad'
 hamane topi par likhaa tha, 'mujhe chahie swaraj' or aaj swaraj kii baat karne waalon ko party virdohi kaha jaataa he
 Swaraj was a very sacred word in our party's ideology, which is based on the book written by AAP
 maanata hum ki swaraj kaa arth yah nahin ki mere jaisaa ek saadhaaran kaaryakarta aapke bade nirnyon main hastkshep kare
 You decide, but let us keep our point
 baithak to hone den
 Or is he also against Swaraj? You may not be aware that our own workers use the word Swaraj in jokes
 sawaal poochne waalon kii khilli udaane ke liye
 Read further, the genuineness of the treason of the AAP! 330 founding members formed a party
 desh bhar ke 300 se adhik jilon main hamaari ikaiyaan hai
 Thousands of workers are keeping the flame of this movement alive throughout the country by blowing their houses
 unki pachaason samasyaayein hai, sawaal hai
 Today has been a party for 3 years
 sthapana ke baad parishad kii keval ek baithak hui wo bhi ek din kii
 Till date those members were never heard
 pichhali baithak main aapane ye vaada kiya tha kii agali baithak 3 dinon kii hogi
 Plenty of prayers, but still no one wants to listen to them
 28 march kii baithak main aupchaariktaayen puri hogi, 31 march ko in sabhi kii sadsyta samaapt hogi or phir ummid he ki sawaal poochne vaale us parishad ke sadsy nahin hongen
 i know you don't like criticism, but i don't like flattery
 aapaki tarif karne vaale to karodon hai
 Hundred two hundred are also going to ask questions? All the members of the National Executive including you had written in writing requesting that the council should hold a meeting for at least 2-3 days
 hamaari samasyaayein suniye or usee mail main maine sabhi parishad sadasyon se bhi nivedan kiya tha ki adhikarik baithak na sahi, ham anaupchaarik baithak karen
 Is this treason too? According to the understanding of our social media team
 rashtriya parishad kii baithak kii maang ko lekar 45 sadasyon ke patr jo aapako bheje the, kya wo koi shadyantr tha? baithak se pehle anaupchaarik hi sahi sabhi sadsy charchaa kar paae is uddesh se aap hi ko bheja hua mail kya koi sajeesh ho sakati he? parishad ke sadsy yadi apane vichaar ek duusare ke saath saajha karte hai or apane muddon ko parishad kii baithak main uthaate hai to kya ho jayega? kis baat kaa bhay he? or kise? kyon ham charchaa se itane bhaagane lage? parishad main shaayad hi koi sadsy ho jo aapke netritv par sawaal uthaae
 But those who contaminate this political movement using your name should have a certain fear
 parishad ke sadsy unase khafa jarur hai or is baithak ko naam diya gaya kejariwal ke khilaaf sajeesh
 Well, it is believed that under the leadership of AAP, this party will bring a big change in the politics of the country
 ho saktaa he andolankariyon kii ab aavashyaktaa na ho
 And it is also believed that a wrong person can come to this party during you, but you will not let him do the wrong thing
 lekin arvind ji vyakti kendrit badlaav dirghakaalin nahin ho saktaa
 a system created by an influential leader only lasts as long as the person himself is in power
 ant main 'aap' kii soshal media fouj se haath jodakar nivedan- raajnneeti main bhavishya banane ke liye aae log sawaal nahin poochhate
 No sensible leader can dare to ask questions after getting such a big victory in Delhi
 ye himmat to vahi kar sakate hai jinhen apane nahin is vaikalpik raajnneeti ke sapane kii phikr ho
 This is how we played our role in the movement
 hamen na tikat chahie, na pad, na koi sammaan
 Just a request to be ashamed of this cap
 sawaal poochne waalon ko apamaanit karne ke liye itnaa neeche na gire ki is topi kii garima ko chot pahunche

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his parliamentary speech today not only responded to the allegations of Congress and opposition on the President's address, but also took many strings
 lagbhag dedh ghante ke bhaashan main unhone sabase pehle congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi par nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said that there was an earthquake yesterday
 jin ilaakon main logon ko asuvidha hui unase ve apni bhaavana vyakt karte hai lekin aakhir bukamp aa hi gaya
 They had already heard its threat
 piem modi ne kaha ki ve bukamp ke aane ke bare main soch rahe the
 After this, PM Modi said about TMC leader Kalyan Banerjee, his Confidential Report (CR) is fine, there will be promotion

 An important fact emerged in the survey
 ki ku l sex karne waalon main se 70 fisadi aise hai, jinhone condom kaa istemaal nahin kiya
 Another important fact was that relations of minor boys in the villages are also being formed with married women, whose working or working husbands stay out for months
 surakshit sex ke maamle main jaipur or alvar ke naaballig aage hai, jabaki sabase asurakshit sex udaipur, jodhpur or barmer ke naaballig kar rahe hai

 In order to master it, do not forget to solve the previous year questions
 sawaalon ko dhyaan se padhein-aisa kai baar hota he ki sawaalon ko pard lene maatr se sawaalon ke jawaab mil jate hai
 If you look at the questions carefully, you will not find them difficult

 'don' kaa sikval yani 'don-2' relies ho gaya
 After 5 years, Don has his eyes on the Deutsche Central Bank in Germany
 don yahaan karansi chhapane vaali printing plates uda lenaa chahta he taaki note luutane kaa jhanjhat hi khatm ho jaae lekin is raah main kai adchane hai jaise khun ke pyaase drug dilers or interpol officer roma
 Top stars like Shah Rukh, huge budget, beautiful locations in Malaysia, Bangkok and Germany, cars hitting foreign roads and the enemy is quick to hit the enemy
 haalanki itnaa ection or thrill kaaphi nahin jiske chalate first half dhimaa lagata he
 In the middle, this stubborn but clever don also kills good dialogues like death has to come, but this time it is my advantage to go to jail, but the story of the film is no different
 bank dakaiti par hollywood or bollywood dheron filmein ban chuki hai
 The film falls in the second half when a bank robbery is carried out
 itane bade bank ko lootnaa itnaa bhi aasaan nahin jitna don ne dikhaa diya

 aise main german police kaa role kya he roma ke liye don kaa obseshan to samaj main aata he lekin don se bhayankar nafrat karne vaali roma don ko maarthi nahin ulte bachaa leti he bhala kiske liye
 Music was also much better than Shahrukh's previous Dawn
 mujhe don ke rimek se zyada ummid 'don-2' se thi kyonki 'don-2' kii script original he lekin ye to kisi hollywood film kii kachi rimek lagati he
 My rating for the average film 'don-2' is 2
 5 star
 You must have seen mountains covered with snow or trees, but hardly you will believe that there is a mountain in this world where there are only graves
 is pahaad ko dekhne par aisa lagata he ki maano vahaan koi ghani aabaadi basii hui he, jabaki aisa bilkul bhi nahin he
 According to media reports, this place of 'pokh Fu Lam' in the western part of Hong Kong is famous for the fact that the graves have been built here in the form of stairway
 agar saamaanya shabdon main kaha jaae to yah pahaad kabron se hi bana he
 Many corpses are buried in this mountain
 aaj ke samay main ye pahaad ek bahut hi vikaraal rup le chukaa he or dur se dekhne main behad hi adbhut lagata he
 Millions of people come to see it but nobody likes to come here at night time
 din pratidin yahaan par laashon ko dafan karne kaa silsilaa badhata chalaa ja rahaa he
 If you have to go from one tomb to another tomb here, then you have to use the stairs
 haalanki yahaan par akele jane kii koi himmat nahin karata
 This place was built in the year 1882 and many corpses were buried here at that time
 rajasthan ke bharatpur ke pingora stesan ke paas mangalvaar subah ek premi yugal kaa shav sandigdh paristhitiyon main mila
 a suicide note has also been found from him, in which it is written that he is dying for the sake of saving the honor of the family
 police cese darj karke maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Station in-charge Jagdish Singh said that the station master RK Meena informed the police after the body of the young woman was found on the side of the railway track 
 maukey par pahunchi police team ne donon shavon ko postmortem ke liye aspataal bhijwa diya
 a suicide note has also been found near the body
 unhone bataaya kipremi yugalane suicide note main likhaa he ki ve apane-apane parivaar kii izzat bachaane ke liye khudakushi kar rahe hai
 Both the dead have been identified as Sunit (25) and Sonam (20)
 postmortem ke baad donon ke shav parijanon ko saunp die gaye hai
 The matter is under investigation
 congress se yah khabar aa rahi he ki rahul gandhi se alag party kisi or ko adhyaksh banane par gambhirtha se vichaar kar rahi he or nae party adhyaksh kii khoj bhi shuru ho gai he
 If senior Congress leaders are to be believed, the new president of the party will be non-gandhi i
e
 the new president will have nothing to do with the Gandhi family
 saath hi agle do se teen maheenon main isaki ghoshnaa kii jaaegi
 Rahul Gandhi is currently on a two-day visit to Wayanad where a large crowd gathered to welcome him
 kaiyon ke haathon main placord tha ki hamen aapaki jarurat he
 But until the situation is clear about the new president in the Congress, there will be confusion in the party
 koi bhi congressi netaa chaahe wo kisi bhi str kaa kyon naa ho yaa kahe aaj ke din yadi wo congress kaarysmiti kaa hi sadsy kyon naa ho use kuch nahin pataa ki congress main kya chal rahaa he
 The reason is clear that since the results of the Lok Sabha elections, ever since Rahul Gandhi has resigned from the post of Congress President, he has not met anyone but one or two leaders
 yani kisi ko nahin maaloom ki rahul gandhi kaa aglaa kadam kya hoga yaa unke man main kya he
 Not only this, he has also vetoed Priyanka Gandhi's name for the post of Congress President
 in sabaki vajah se congress philhal netaa viheen lag rahi he or isaki vajah se party ke anushaasan par asar pad rahaa he khaskar rajyon main
 In Telangana, 12 Congress mlas have left the party and joined TRS
 yani ek tarah se puri party kaa hi tiares main vilay ho gaya he
 In the same way, the dispute between Captain vs Navjot Singh Sidhu in Punjab caught so much that Captain had to change his department while taking action against Sidhu
 captain ne bhi kaaphi intjaar kiya ki party alaakaman se koi signal mil jaae magar jab dilli se koi nirdesh nahin aayaa to unhone khud siddhu kaa vibhaag badal diya
 Similar situation is there in Rajasthan, where reports of differences and differences between Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot come daily
 congress alaakaman ko chahie tha ki donon ko aamane-saamne bithakar unka jhagadaa sulajhaate, magar gahalot or payalat abhi bhi rajasthan kii sabhi 25 seat haarane kaa thikra ek duusare par phod rahe hai
 Talking about Haryana, the meeting convened to review the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections was so tumultuous that the state president started saying that hang me, shoot me, i will go
 yah sab congress ke varisht netaa gulam nabi aaazaad kii maujuudagi main ho rahaa tha
 Everyday Congress mlas in Karnataka do not desist from making rhetoric against their own state government and Chief Minister Kumaraswamy looks resentful saying that i am not being allowed to function properly
 kuch aisi hi khabar goa se aa rahi he jahaan 10 ke kareeb congress vidhayak apana ek alag gut banane kii taiyaari main hai or yah sab ho rahaa he rahul gandhi kii nishyakriyata kii vajah se
 Now Congress leaders and activists are asking who is the President of the Congress
 yadi rahul adhyaksh nahin hai to nae adhyaksh par jaldi faisla kyon nahin ho rahaa he? log yah kehane lage hai ki yaa to rahul rahen yaa jaaen magar faisla jaldi ho
 Now the pressure on Congress leaders is increasing that a decision should be taken on the new president soon to stop the increasing indiscipline of Congress leaders in the states
 yahi vajah he ki ye khabaren aani shuru ho gai he ki agle do teen maheene ke andar congress ko nayaa gaiyr gandhi adhyaksh milane vaala he

 input- bhashaa The main reason for Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina not being selected in the limited overs series against Sri Lanka was the failure of both of them in the 'yo-yo' stamina test at the National Cricket Academy (NCA)
 bhartiya timaniyamit taur par kai tarah ke fitness pareekshan se guzarati he or inamen 'yo-yo' damakham pareekshan sabase mahatvapurn he
 This is a better 'beep' test than the kind of tests the older generation went through
 maujuuda bhartiya team ko abhi tak kii sabase feet team mana jaataa he
 Yuvraj and Raina's score is quite low
 It is learned that 'yo-yo' scores 19 for the current team
 5 yaa usase adhik sweekaarya he
 Virat Kohli, India's most fit cricketer, scored a score of around 21 in this test
 vahiin yuvaraj or raina ne is pareekshan main 19
 Scored significantly less than 5
 yuvaraj keval 16 kaa score hi bana paae, jo ki unke team se baahar hone kaa mukhya kaaran rahaa
 The bcci's full emphasis on fitness, a BCCI official said on condition of anonymity, "the current think tank, coach Ravi Shastri, captain Virat Kohli and selection committee chairman MSK Prasad have made it clear that there is no compromise on the level of fitness Will be done
 ' unhone kaha, 'ausatan austrailian cricketer 'yo-yo' pareekshan main 21 kaa score banaate hai
 Here Virat, Ravindra Jadeja and Manish Pandey consistently score this, while the other 19
 5 yaa isse adhik kaa score hasil karte hai
 "earlier, when there used to be a traditional beep test, most of the Indian players of the nineties, except Mohammad Azharuddin, Robin Singh and Ajay Jadeja, were 16 to 16," the official said
 5 kaa score banaate the
 But now the situation is different and the captain himself is setting the criteria which the Australian team has set for itself
 'aakhir kya he yo-yo testsiob jaraa 'yo-yo' pareekshan ko bhi samaj len
 With the help of several 'cones' two lines are made at a distance of 20 meters

 The player runs between two consecutive lines and has to turn when the beep rings
 har ek minute yaa isi tarah se teji badhati jaati he
 If the line is not reached on time, then two more 'beeps' have to catch pace
 agar khilaadi do chhoron par teji hasil nahin kar paata he to pareekshan roak diya jaataa he
 The entire process is based on software, in which the results are recorded
 gehun phir se desh ke kai bade shaharon main mahangaa ho gaya he
 Where it is cheaper, the sale has been halved due to demonetisation
 kul milakar gehun kaa kaarobaar sankat main he
 According to the latest data available with the Food Ministry, wheat has become costlier by Rs 400 a quintal in Chennai between November 20 and December 10, while in these twenty days it costs Rs 210 a quintal in Varanasi and Rs 200 in Patna, Hisar, Panchkula and Siliguri
 The quintal has increased
 haalanki sarkaar ne gehun kii keemton par nakel kasne kii taiyaari pehle se shuru kar di he
 The government first lowered the import duty from 25 per cent to 10 per cent in September and now reduced it to zero last week
 ab sawaal ye uth rahaa he ki jab rabi kaa gehun bazaar pahonchega to kya kisaanon ko uski vaazib keemat mil paaegi, kyonki tab tak aayaat kiya hua gehun aa chukaa hoga
 Will this decision increase farmers' problems? narela mandi main da farmars agro-credit kooparative market limited ke manager pratap singh khatri kehete hai, 'sarkaar ne gehun par aayaat shulk khatm karne kaa jo faisla kiya he, usase kisaanon ko nuksaan hoga

 Wheat traders in Narela mandi say that after demonetisation, buyers are coming down because they have cash crisis

 Wheat trader Ashish Jain told NDTV, wheat is selling low in the market
 jo khariddaar hai, unamem se kai ke paas bank acount nahin he or wo online bankig nahin jaanate
 Because of this, wheat sales have halved
 kaarobaar ghatane kaa sabase zyaada khamiyaaza mazdoor bhugat rahe hai
 Contractor Munna says work in the mandi has decreased by 70 per cent
 vyapaariyon ke paas cash kam he or mazaduron ko check se pement kar rahe hai, jise bank main bhunaanaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 However, the government has already started preparations to tighten the prices of wheat
 sarkaar ne pehle sitambar main aayaat shulk 25 fisadi se ghataakar 10 fisadi kiya or ab pichley hafte shunya kar diya
 Now the question is arising that when the Rabi wheat reaches the market, will the farmers get a fair price, because by then the imported wheat will have arrived
 kya ye faisalaa kisaanon kii pareshaani badhayega? Pratap Singh Khatri, manager of The Farmers agro-credit Cooperative Market Limited in Narela Mandi, says, "the government's decision to abolish import duty on wheat will hurt farmers
" unhen pehle se hi unki upaj kaa sahi keemat nahin mil paa rahaa he
 Comments sankat itnaa bhar nahin he, dilli kii narela mandi main gehun in dinon sasta bhi hua he
 But due to demonetisation, the sale has halved

 urdu, farsi or hindustani jubaan main koi janaa aisa bhi he kya, jisane harf padhe hon or mirza gaalib ko na jaanata ho
 The famous poet Mirza Ghalib was born on 27 December 1797 in Agra
 un kaa puraa naam asadulla khan gaalib tha
 He grew up in a family with a military background in Agra
 unke chachaa east india company kii sena main the
 With his pension, the entire family used to be Gujrabasar
 par us jamaane main pension behad kam hua karti thi, so bachapan killat main shuru kya hua, taumr bana hi rahaa
 You say on every thing, what are you, you say what is this style-a-secret
 
 
 unhone farsi, urdu or arabi bhashaa kii padhai kii, or behad kam umr main hi likhnaa shuru kar diya
 Sometimes he used to write 'assad' instead of 'ghalib' in the surname
 12 saal kii umr tak aate-aate se urdu or farsi ghazal main unka sikaa chalanaa shuru ho gaya
 i got married soon after getting fame
 choti umr main shaadi se ishq-e-haqiqi or ishq-e-mizaaji donon main maharath hasil ho gai
 This love is not easy, so much understanding, i am a river of fire, and you have to drown
 
 
 par ulfat kaa yah daur zyada din nahin chalaa
 ishq-e-haqqi was heavy on ishq-e-mizaji
 abhaav or dukh is nayab shaayar ko manj rahe the
 Their ghazals were going beyond time and limits
 ek se bad kar ek
 Look at the hallmark: Thousands of wishes are such that every wish will be fulfilled, many people come out of my heart, but still less
 
 
 nikalnaa kuld se aadam kaa, sunate aae the lekin,bahut beabaru ho kar, tere kuche se ham nikle
 
 
 There is no difference in love, to live and to die, to live by seeing only the Kafir who died
 
 
 gaalib se pehle or unke baad koun likh paaya aisa
 It is said that he had seven children in this period, but none of them could live
 is gam se ubarne ke liye unhone sharaab, shaayari kaa daaman tham liya
 However, between gum and lack, Mirza Ghalib would not have made any connection to what she had created
 vah apane bare main khud kaha karte the -hai or bhi duniya main sukhnwar bahut achche,kehete hai ki gaalib kaa he andaaj-e-bayaan or
 
 
 Looking at the history, Mirza Ghalib was one of the chief poets of the court of the last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar II
 par mughaliya sultanate kaa vah akhiri daur tha, khud main itnaa jarjar or bezaar ki gaalib ko sahaara kya miltaa? unki mali haalat main koi bahut ijapha na hua
 Do not ask how are you, my back, you see what color is yours, in front of me
 
 
 'ek din sab kuch chhodkar chalaa jaaoongaa' kah chale gaye nirendranath chakravartihalanki badshaah ne unhen dabeer-ul-mulk or nazm-ud-daula ke khitaab se nawaaza or baad main unhen mirza nosha kaa khitaab bhi mila
 After this, Ghalib added Mirza with his name, but he used to say - we know the reality of Jannat but 'ghalib' to keep the heart happy, this idea was good Hamirza Ghalib was fond of meat, wine and gambling
 sharaab or jua jaisi buree aadaten jindagi bhar unka peechha nahin chhod pain
 Perhaps this was the reason that in spite of royal honor in his lifetime despite doing excellent shayari, he did not get the love he deserved among the people
 na tha kuch to khuda tha, kuch na hota to khuda hota,duboya mujh ko hone ne, na hota main to kya hota
 
 
 Despite this, due to the respect received from the emperor, he was counted among the famous people of Delhi
 gaalib ne apni buree aadaton khaskar sharabkhori kaa zikr kuch is andaaj main kiya-'gaalib' chhutii sharaab par ab bhi kabhi kabhipitha hoon rose-e-abr o shab-e-maahtaab menmirza gaalib par ek kitaab aayi to usamen daawa kiya gaya tha ki mirza pine ke itane shaukeen the ki koi raat aisi na thi, jisamen unhone piyaa na ho
 However, after the intoxication increased and there was shame and shame, he vowed to drink at bedtime and also fixed the quantity
 ve usase zyada phir kabhi nahin lete the, par quality umdaa ho gai
 The book claimed that Mirza was fond of drinking English liquor such as Costelin and Old Tom
 or is halaat main bhi vah likhte to kya umdaa likhte
 Ah want to have an age effect, who lives till the head of your sliver
 
 
 hamane mana ki tagaaful na karoge lekin,khak ho jaaenge ham tumko khabar hone tak
 
 
 Mirza Ghalib wrote countless ghazals
 unhone zindagi ko behad kareeb se dekha or alamasti main jiya
 His ghazals held deep meaning
 ragon main daudte phirane ke ham nahin kaayal,jo aankh hi se na tapakaa, to wo lahu kya he
 
 
 This is an attempt to expose Fake history
 These books also wrote letters, which are considered important documents of Urdu writing
 haalanki ye chitthiyaan unke jeevankaal main kahin bhi chhapi nahin
 Born on Hindustani land, this rare Shar died on February 15, 1869

 But Ghalib has not gone anywhere, even today, he keeps running with his poetry in our veins

 Salman Khan's upcoming film 'sultan' has been in discussion between fans and audiences for quite some time

 Salman's 'sultan' will be released on Eid this year and Aamir's 'dangal' on Christmas

 lekin vidhansabha main mukhyamantri mufti mohammad said mukar gaye
 The Mufti said that there would be no system for anyone in the valley to live separately
 sabhi sampradaay ke log samaaj main saath hi rahenge
 Kashmiri Pandits will live with Muslims
 algaavvaadi netayasin malik ne kaha ki kashmiri pandit waapas lauten or ham sab ke saath rahen
 It is not right to live in a separate township
 24 ghante main bayaan se mukare muftitownship ko lekar mukhyamantri mufti 24 ghante main hi bayaan se mukar gaye
 After the meeting with Rajnath Singh on 7 April, the statement issued by the government said that the Union Home Minister asked for land to build a township for the Kashmiri Pandits
 mukhyamantri mufti mohammad said ne jald se jald jameen muhaiyaa karaane kaa bharosa diya
 But within 24 hours of this, the Mufti overturned his statement

 log in bataur sex shikshak main puure yakeen se kah sakati hum ki bedroom ke sankat kii aisi anek misaalen hai ki kai baar purush apni 'sex-virakt' patni kii shikaayatein lekar aate hai
 Seeing this, i got confused why only husbands want sex and wives get cold
 maine isamen gahare paithne kaa faisla kiya or kai auraton se apane patiyon main dilchaspee kho baithne ke bare main baat kii
 Without exhausting household chores, children, husbands, in-laws' service and without any emotional support from the husband, the working woman not only earns more than the husband, but also plays a much larger role in running the household
 adhikansh ke liye sex sirf antarang shaareerik kriya hi nahin, balki uske maansik or bhaavnaatmak pahalu bhi bade hai
 In a relationship in which the division of discriminatory male-female roles is stricter and there is no emotional connection, the sense of disinterest is often seen more than sex
 aisa aksar auraton ke saath zyada hota he, jo ghar or daftar ke bich jhulate hue aakhirkaar apane pati ke saath sex main dilchaspee kho baithti hai, jo unhen na aadar or na samarthan dete hai jisaki ve hakdaar hai
 a marriage of convenience: a 'wedding', which is dependent only on each other's favor, becomes overwhelming for most
 purush-satta vaala samaaj auraton ko sirf sex ke saamaan kii tarah baratata he, jo unhen sex kii chahat se virakt kar detaa he
 a healthy relationship is one in which two people instinctively show love towards each other, which ultimately will make them fall apart
 lekin agar kisi jode kaa pyaar kaa iklauta saadhan sex he to vah bhi donon partneron main bhaavnaatmak lagaav kii lalak paidaa kar saktaa he
 Wives seeking romance and love gestures often lose interest in sex by finding that husbands pay attention only when they feel the need
 hambistar hone ke pehle or baad kii kriyaaon kaa sex ke ehsaas par kaaphi asar hota he
 The daily mess of marital life also takes away from the 'moment of love'
 ab sex or bacchon kii baat!'aagyaakaari bhartiya patni' banane kii koshish main auraten apane patiyon se sex par baatcheet karne main sankoch karti hai kyonki kahin unhen 'kulata' na samaj liya jaae
 Many women refrain from discussing their fantasies, problems and making sex life enjoyable to avoid this unbridled stigma
 sex santushti hameshaa hi rishte main santushti ke bhav se hi paidaa hoti he jo aise samaaj main hona asambhav he jahaan pati-patni bistar par khulkar baat na kar paaen or sex naitikta or saamaajik haisiyat se judi ho
 There are different things for everyone which ultimately arouses desires
 sirf ek partner kii sex santushti par hi nirbhar rahanaa or apni shaareerik ichchhaaon kaa khyaal na karnaa, donon hi partneron ko virakt karata he
 With time and practice, the feeling of sex satisfaction develops and even after that there is a need for constant communication
 apane pati ko 'chil-chhabila' maanane vaali auraton ko bhi bistar kii kriyaaon kaa anubhav nahin hota
 There is an effort to have sex, not to understand it, like taking care of the fulfillment of your sex desires without understanding the needs of the partner
 vaah, vaah, shukriyaasex ke vakt sirf apni santushti kaa khyaal rakhane vaale pati aksar patniyon ke sukh ko bemaani bana dete hai jo yaa to juthi santushti ke bhav ko hi maan leti hai yaa uske bina hi kaam chalaati rahati hai
 And why should someone else be content with gratification when he gets more satisfaction from masturbation? In this era of untouchable information and resources about sex on the Internet, you have many ways available to make your partner happy
 santushti ke bina sex na karne ko pasand karne vaali auraten darasal unheen mardon kii vajah se hai jo is kala main paarangat nahin hai or koshish bhi nahin karte
 Not surprisingly, marriage relationships ultimately turn into sexless lives
 pallavi baranwaal antarang rishton kii coach, lekhak-stanbhakaar or website redwumb kii sansthaapak hai*** Nearly two and a half years after demonetisation, the police nabbed six members of a gang in a shocking case with a note of more than Rs 1 crore taken out of circulation
 varisht police adheekshak (SSP) ruchivardhan mishra ne bataaya ki mubir kii soochna par emji road kshetra main pakade gaye aropiyon kii pahchaan mohammad asalam ali (25), dilip jena (31), rajeev kumaar panda (25), divyaram byowara (27), vishaal singh parihaar (33) or jai kushavaah (33) ke rup main hui he
 Four of its members, including gang leader Aslam, are residents of Odisha, while two others hail from the city of Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh
 unhone bataaya ki giroh ke sadasyon ne kanoon pravartan agenciyon kii nigahon se bachane ke liye skool baigon main band kiye gaye note chipa rakhe the
 During the search, one crore one lakh 15 thousand rupees notes were recovered from these bags in the form of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes
 ye band note kathith taur par odisha ke vyapaariyon se yah kahkar praapt kiye gaye the ki inhen 'kamishan ke aadhaar par' prachlit mudra se badalawa diya jayega
 The SSP said that the arrested accused are being interrogated to whom they had received the consignment of the closed notes and by whom it was to be replaced with the prevailing currency
 iskar vibhaag or pravartan nideshaalay ko bhi maamle kii soochna di ja rahi he
 However, large consignments of closed notes have been caught here earlier

 When you are unable to use your discretion, get rid of it by banning it directly, this is something governments have done in India for the last several years
 british documentry mekar lesley udwin apane parivaar ko chhod kar pichley 2 saal se bharat main hai taaki 16 disambar ko hue nirbhaya balaatkaar par dacumentry bana saken
 But as soon as part of this documentary, in which the culprit Mukesh Singh has given a disputed statement, the BBC published a ruckus from the media to the Parliament, and finally Leslie will have to make rounds of the court to get this documentary released
 
 ek jo dharna logon main bani he, wo ye he ki yah documentry aparaadhiyon kaa paksh dikhaa rahi he, unhen apni baat rakhane kaa mauka de rahi he
 But Leslie has clearly stated that she wants to show the rape mentality through her documentary
 kisi apradhi kaa yah koi pehla intervyuu nahin he
 Afzal Guru has also been interviewed from jail
 kuch din pehle hi veda pratap vaidic haafiz said kaa intervyuu liye jane kaa bhi daawa kar rahe the
 Did the government take any action against it? If an offender is interviewed, it does not encourage him
 or yah bhi zaruri nahin ki yah uskaa paksh dikhaa rahaa ho
 When we show or discuss anti-women statements of violence, rape and politicians on the news channels, is the intention behind this to air in favor of that crime? Unless you watch the entire film, how will you decide who is the hero and who is the villain? rajnath singh kaa kahana he ki is documentry ko banane ke liye ijazat sambandhi kaayadon kaa ulanghan hua he
 But Leslie has the permission of the Ministry of Home Affairs and written permission of the criminal Mukesh Singh to make this documentary
 venkaiya naidu ne kaha he ki ye sajeesh he duniya bhar main bharat kaa naam karaab karne kii, isliye ham is par pratibandh lagaayenge
 But Naidu forgets that this documentary will be shown all over the world and by banning it, your government is again exposing the narrow mindset of this country to the whole world
 jo bhi baat mukesh singh ne documentry main kahi he, wo har baat sansad main doharaai ja chuki he, news channelon par bahes ke dauraan penlist doharaa chuke hai
 Then what is the meaning of the ban? It is possible that in this film, no new thing is coming in front of the society, but what is already there in the society, why ban it from being shown in this film? Due to the sensitive content in this documentary, precautions can be taken
 jaise ki aap ise prime time main naa dikhaa kar 11 baje bhi iskaa prasaaran kar sakate hai
 Such precautionary steps were also shown for one season of 'bigg Boss'
 isamen apradhi or vakeelon ke chehron ko dhanka ja saktaa he jaisaa ki news channel ehtiyathan karte hai
 The government is only banning its ban by banning like this
 agar court ne bhi iske prasaaran par roak lagane ko kaha he tab bhi sarkaar ko iske prasaaran ke paksh main lesley ke saath khadaa hona chahie varanaa sunishchit kare ki wo har mahila virdohi bayaan dene vaale ko bain karegi
 Why shouldn't people come to the truth that criminals in jail are not improving, they are becoming criminals? Why should not this side come to know that the thinking of a less educated poor class to a educated upper class man is almost same with girls
 lekin hamaara sach ye he ki ham bina kisi chiz ko dekhe or soche-samajhe is 'bain' parampara ko sinchate chalenge
 Because they are a country of 'selective' revolutionaries

 Some children also took autographs from them

 Seeing the order of the Chief Judicial Magistrate as a major setback, his lawyer Rebecca John said that the CBI first gave a clean chit to Rajesh Talwar and then overturned him
 sibiai ne is maamle ko band karne ke liye report daakhil kii thi
 He told reporters, "whatever happened the first and second time is a huge smudge

 He said, there is no arrest warrant or apprehension of arrest

 It seems that he must have done something big

 Surprisingly, despite such a big charge, the RJD did not expel Rajaballabh from the party, which the BJP and JDU continue to attack

 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha ki 2002 main gujarat dange bhadakaane ke liye narendra modi sarkaar jimmedaar he, jabaki congress sarkaar ne 1984 ke sikh virdohi dangon ko rokane kii koshish kii thi
 However, Rahul did not regret the 84 riots
 aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main ek tarah se modi ke pratidwandvi maane ja rahe rahul ne kaha ki vah modi se dare hue nahin hai or congress bhaajapa ko aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav haraayegi
 In an interview to a private news channel, Rahul directly attacked Modi, saying, "the truth is that innocent people were killed in 1984 and innocents killed is a terrible thing that should not happen
" gujarat or 1984 main antar yah he ki (2002 ke) dangon main gujarat kii sarkaar shaamil thi
 ' saakshaatkaar ke dauraan jab rahul se poocha gaya ki jab adaalat ne modi ko clin chit de di he to vah unhen jimmedaar kyon tehra rahe hai, is par congress upaadhyaksh ne kaha, 'gujarat ke dange jab hue tab vah mukhyamantri the
 The Gujarat government was actually further aggravating the riots
 ' Underlining the difference between the role of governments in Delhi's anti-sikh riots and the Gujarat riots, Rahul said, "the simple difference is that in 1984 the government was not involved in the genocide
 gujarat main vah shaamil thi
 He said that in 1984 the Congress government was not inciting or helping the riots, rather the government tried to stop the violence
 jab rahul se phir se jor dekar poocha gaya ki vah gujarat dangon par modi par nishaanaa kaise saadh sakate hai to unhone kaha, 'yah main nahin, badi sankhya main logon ne dekha ki dangon main gujarat sarkaar sakriyata se shaamil thi
 ' yah puche jane par ki kya vah 1984 ke dangon ke liye maafee maangenge, yaa vah yah mahasoos karte hai ki isaki koi jarurat nahin he, rahul ne kaha, 'sabase pehle, main in dangon main bilkul bhi shaamil nahin tha
 It was not that i was part of it
 ' isi ke saath unhone sweekaara, 'kuch congressi log 1984 ke sikh virdohi dangon main sambhavat: sanlipt the or iske liye unhen sajaa di gai he
 ' yah puche jane par ki kya vah congress party kii ore se maafee maangenge, unhone kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki ye dange, sabhi dangon kii tarah daraavnee ghatana thi
 Frankly, i was not involved in the activities of the Congress party
 ' Rahul was asked if he agreed with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's view that Modi led the 'massacre' of innocents on the streets of Ahmedabad, saying, "what the Prime Minister is saying is fact
" gujarat main (yah) hua or log maare gaye
 ' yah puche jane par ki kya vah congress kii ore se pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar nahin banakar modi se sidhi takkar se batch rahe hai, rahul ne kaha, 'yah sawaal samajhane ke liye, aapako kuch samajhnaa padegaa, rahul gandhi koun hai or phir is sawaal kaa aapako uttar milegaa ki rahul gandhi kisase darate hai or kisase nahin

 main chunaav jitunga
 I'm sure ' unhone kaha ki congress 'jang ke liye taiyaar' he or 'jeetne vaali' he
 Asked if the Congress does not win the election, will he take responsibility for it, Rahul said, "if we don't win, i am the vice president of the party, i will take responsibility
" ' modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaae jane par unhone kaha, 'bhaajapa satta ko ek vyakti ke paas kendrit karne main vishwaas rakhti he
