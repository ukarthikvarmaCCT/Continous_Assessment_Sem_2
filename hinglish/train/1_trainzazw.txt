 The party which could not remove the mosquito in 10 years, how will it be able to clean Delhi in the coming time? If you vote for BJP, then in the coming 5 years, there will be such filth in Delhi that there will be dengue and chikungunya
 'kejariwal ne aarope lagaate hue kaha 'pichley kuch dinon se bijli or pani kii katautee ko lekar shikaayatein aa rahi hai

 According to Kejriwal, 'congress is over in the country and Delhi now
 chunaav main congress ko vot dene kaa koi phayda nahi he, apana vot congress ko dekar barbaad na karen
 Arvind Kejriwal targeted the BJP and said, "if your child gets dengue or chikungunya tomorrow, you will be responsible yourself because you voted for the dengue-chikungunya-mosquito-messing party

 The serving doctors of the state, who have been threatening mass resignation for several days, have gone on mass strike since Sunday night
 udhar sarkaar ne resma (rajasthan aavashyak seva sangrakshan adhinium) lagaate hue doctoron kii hadtaal ko gaiyrkanoonee ghoshit karte hue sakht karrvai ke aadesh die hai
 Actually, talks with Medical Minister Kalicharan Saraf and doctors' organizations continued till 2
30 pm on Sunday, but the matter did not materialize
 uske baad rajyabar ke jila aspataalon, siechasi, medical college ke doctor hadtaal par chale gaye jisaki vajah se marijon ko aaj baari pareshaani uthaani padi
 However, to deal with this, the state government has deployed doctors of Railways, Army Hospital and BSF in hospitals
 saath hi kaha he kiniji aspatalonse bhi sahyog maanga ja rahaa he taaki marijon ko koi pareshaani nahin ho
 Explain that the main reason for the quarrel is the deployment of State Administrative Service officers to the post of Additional Director in the Government Medical Department, while the doctors say that senior doctors have been posted on this post and they should be posted
 iske alaava saatven vetanman kii visangatiyaan, cader samaan karne orgrade pe badhanejaisi maange hai
 The government has refused to accept the demand of doctors to work in an innings
 narendra modi ko kai varshon tak achhut ghoshit kiye rakhane ke baad ab america apni nitiyon main teji se badlaav karne ja rahaa he
 At first he sent his ambassador Nancy Powell to meet him, but now he is going to leave him
 angreji akhbaar hindustan times kii ek report ke mutabik america bharat main ek nayaa rajdoot behaal karne ja rahaa he taaki vah nai sarkaar ke saath milakar kaam kare
 a politician could be given this important position in place of current Ambassador Nancy Powell so that relations with India can be renewed
 akhbaar ke mutabik bharat-america rishton ko repere karne ke liye powell ko hataa saktaa he
 Relations between the two countries have deteriorated
 ise america thik karnaa chahta he, lekin powell ko hataane ke bare main abhi koi tithi tay nahin hui he
 It is believed that after the Lok Sabha elections i
e
 after May 16, America will take steps in this regard
 sabase badi baat he ki america ko yah lag rahaa he ki yahaan modi kii sarkaar ban jaaegi or unke america aane par lagi roak se donon deshon ke parsparik sambandhon main daraar aa jaaegi
 a senior BJP leader told the newspaper that Powell's removal is almost certain because she has a very cold attitude towards PM candidate Narendra Modi
 samajha jaataa he ki powell ne america ko modi par lage vija bain ko hataane nahin diya jabaki anya pashchimi deshon ne yah kadam uthaa liya
 She is believed to have been reluctant to meet the Gujarat CM
 modi ko lagata he ki powell upie kii videsh niti ke kaaphi kareeb hai
 She did not want to go to Gandhinagar
 is aarope ke jawaab main america sutron kaa kahana he ki powell par upie sarkaar kaa dabaav tha ki vah modi se naa milen
 Now the removal of Powell can calm the Modi camp
 ek diplomat ne kaha ki rajanithik uddeshyon ke liye kisi diplomat kii bali chadh janaa uske kariyar kaa hissaa hota he
 The relationship between the two countries has also led to a breach in the case of Devyani Khobragade taking her clothes off
 is maamle main bhi agar powell chusti dikhaati to masalaa hal ho saktaa tha lekin unhone kuch nahin kiya
 Senior Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Pravin Togadia is refraining from speaking anything about his hate speech
 jab hamaare sahyogi channel 'hedlins today' ne bhadakaau bhaashan ke bare main unase baat karne kii koshish kii, to vah shuru main tippanee karne se inkaar karte rahe, lekin baad main jor dekar kaha he ki unhone kuch bhi galat nahin kiya tha
 Togadia said that he did not name any community nor threatened violence, he was just speaking on old incidents
 gauratlab he ki emm vidhayak akbaruddin ovaisi ke bhadakaau bhaashan ke baad praveen togadiya ne bhi javaabi bhadakaau bhaashan diya he
 It can be clearly seen in the video on youtube that Pravin Togadia has used derogatory words for majlis-e-ettehadul MLA Akbaruddin Owaisi
 haalanki unhone apane bhaashan main ovaisi kaa kahin bhi naam nahin liya he
 a complaint has been filed against Pravin Togadia in this regard
 forest range main padasth ek mahila vanarakshak, jaanwaron kii gananaa ke liye nikali to maut se saamana ho gaya
 Following a pugmark, she reached the drain, and saw that a tiger is sitting 8 to 10 meters away
 baagh ne unako dekhakar dahaad lagaai lekin vah tus se mas nahin hui
 For one and a half hours, she stood with the eye of a tiger
 ghatana madhya pradesh ke hoshangabad jile kii he
 Sudha Dhurve, a female forest guard posted in the Matkuli range of Satpura Tiger Reserve in Hoshangabad district of Madhya Pradesh, stood in front of the tiger for two and a half hours on Tuesday morning with her two fellow watchmen
 baagh ne daraane ke liye kai baar dahaad kii lekin training ko yadakar sudhaa dhurve bina koi movement kiye ek jagah hi khadi rahi
 Sudha said in a gesture to fellow chowkidars that the tiger would attack if they tried to escape
 isliye ve baagh ke saamne khadey rahe
 After encountering death for an hour and a half, the tiger left from there
 iske baad ye log waapas aae
 According to the officials of the Baghsatpura Tiger Reserve, which was sitting 8 to 10 meters, during the census in Jhiriya Beet, Sudha Dhurve accompanied fellow chowkidars to enumerate wild animals in the forest area
 subah saadhe 6 baje pagadendi par unhen kuch pagamark najar aae
 Chasing Jin, as soon as he reached a brook, he sensed that a tiger is sitting at a distance of 8 to 10 meters
 dhurve or saathi chaukidaaron ne bataaya ki baagh ne hamen dekh liya tha
 a watchman retreated as soon as he ran away
 baagh hamalaa karne kii mudra main aa gaya
 However there was no movement from there
 laal kile se pradhanmantri narendra modi ne aadhi jansankhya ko swasthya beemaa dene kii yojana ko lagu karne kaa elaan kiya
 About 11 thousand crore rupees will be spent on this scheme every year
 is kharch kaa boj donon kendra sarkaar or rajya sarkaron ko vahan karnaa hoga
 It is worth mentioning that 10 crore families will get the benefit of the National Health Protection Scheme 'ayushman Bharat' announced by the Finance Minister in the Union Budget 2018, which is also dubbed as 'modicare' by the Central Government
 is yojana kaa sidhaa phayda lagbhag 40 se 50 karod kii aabaadi ko pahonchega
 According to the central government scheme, about 50 crore people will be given health insurance of Rs 5 lakh and for this, 1 per year to the central government
 72 dollar (11 hajaar karod rupee) kaa boj sarkari khajaane par daalana padegaa
 NITI Aayog has said on this plan that about 5500-6000 crore rupees will be spent on this scheme from the central government account
 ise padhein: bharat duniya kii chhathi badi iconomi, ab karegaa teen dashakon tak netritvkendriya bajet main sarkaar ne is skim ke liye kendra ke khajaane se 2000 karod rupee kaa praavdhaan kiya he
 This amount has been provisioned to provide health insurance to the people during the financial year 2018-19
 vahiin kendra sarkaar main sutron kaa daawa he ki aage chalakar is yojana ke liye kendra sarkaar or bajet kaa praavdhaan karegi
 However, many state governments are already making some kind of health insurance provision in the country
 kuch rajyon kaa kahana he ki kendra sarkaar kii yojana ke chalate rajya sarkaar kii yojanaayen prabhavit hongi
 According to the NITI Aayog, 60 percent of the expenditure for this scheme will be borne by the Center and the remaining 40 percent by the state government
 kendra sarkaar ke anumaan ke mutabik desh main ek vyakti ko yah beemaa dene kii laagat lagbhag1100 rupee aegi
 Significantly, this health insurance plan is being called the Obama government's Obamacare or modicare on the lines of America's Obamacare
 kendra sarkaar ko 2019 main aam chunaavon kaa saamana karnaa he
 Hence, the opposition may argue that the populist parties of the scheme have some political benefits
 desh main rajyon ke str par aisi yojanaayen pehle se chal rahi hai
 Read this: 60 years vs
 60 months, will the NITI Aayog overturn the Planning Commission? Obamacare was the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act brought under the tenure of former US President Barack Obama, which the Obama administration brought before the elections and was easily followed by President Obama The second term was decided
 haalanki america main baraak obama ke baad bani donald trump sarkaar ne is yojana ko band kar diya
 The new administration claims that the benefit of this scheme is low and the expenditure is high
 baharhaal, itnaa saaf he ki obama prashasan kaa obamakare yadi mahaj chunaav jeetne kaa formula tha to vah is ranneeti main safal hue
 Now the world's largest health insurance scheme will be implemented after the announcement from Red Fort
 is skil ko lagu karne ke liye kendra sarkaar or rajya sarkaar rodmap bana chuke hai
 At the same time, funds have already been given for this scheme from FY 2018
 lihaaja, agle kuch dinon main kendra sarkaar is yojana kii baarikiyon ke saath-saath insurance plan, shaamil companiyaan, deshbhar main hospital network or heltho insurance kii premium raashi kaa khulaasa karegi

 How did the organization stand? According to Deodhar, when we started work in Tripura, we went ahead in a very planned way and today we are in the power of the state

 Now these fronts are present at the district level
 morcha banane ke baad hamane rajya kii prayek vidhansabha seat par focus kiya, jise ham mandal bhi kehete hai

 The politics of Jammu and Kashmir has been hot on the statement of Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj, in which she said that Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader Mehbooba Mufti recently attended the National Integration Council (NIC) meeting of Gujarat
 Chief Minister Narendra Modi was praised
 padhein shams taahir khan kaa blogumehabooba ne sushamaa ke is bayaan kaa khandan karte hue mangalvaar ko kaha ki unhone kabhi bhi modi kii tarif nahin kii jabaki jammu evam kashmir ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla ne kaha ki mehabooba dwaara modi kii saraahna karne se unhen tanik bhi aashcharya nahin hua
 Sahil Joshi's blog is worth mentioning that Sushma, who reached Modi's Sadbhavna Mission, said on Monday, "if Advani ji praises Modi, it can be understood that he is praising him with affection, i can appreciate Modi
 i am praising him as the Chief Minister of our party
 lekin haal hi main enaisi kii baithak main pidipi jaisi ghor virdohi party kii netaa mehabooba mufti ne modi kii tarif kii
 See in pictures Narendra Modi's journey so far, Naambaheba said, refuting Sushma's statement, 'my words have been misrepresented
 main bharat sarkaar se aagrah karti hum ki vah mere bhaashan kii prati nikaale taaki sab saaf ho jaae
 He said, 'I think the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is disappointed
 main usase kahuungi ki yadi use apni dharmanirpekshata sabit karne ke liye muslim netaaon kii jarurat he to vah faruk abdulla se sampark kare, jinhone modi kii prashansa kii thi or kaha tha ki unhen modi kii ankhon main allaah dikhte hai
 'video: Narendra Modi turned politician Omar Abdullah, targeting political bigwigs, Mehbooba said,' Omar was a minister in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government when Muslims were massacred in Gujarat
 ' mehabooba ne kaha, 'umr din bhar main hajaar twit karte hai ore kehete hai ki nijee jindagi main ai ulajhanon ke baavjood vah bataur mukhyamantri kadi mehnat kar rahe hai
 He was also present at that meeting of NIC but why he is tweeting after 15 days
 'ajtak LIVE TV dekhne ke liye clic karenisse pehle mehabooba ko katghare main khadaa karne kii koshish ke tahat umr ne twit kiya, 'mehabooba dwaara modi kii tarif kiye jane se mujhe tanik bhi aashcharya nahin hua
 She can appreciate what she likes
 mujhe aashcharya is baat kaa he ki dusron ne bhi unka bhaashan suna tha or iske baavjood vah iskaa khandan kar rahi hai
 'she said,' Why is she not accepting it instead of refuting it
 sushamaa swaraj ke bayaan ko jhooth kehane kii apeksha unhen ise sweekaar karnaa chahie
 In another tweet, Omar said, 'at least Mehbooba's father Mufti Mohammed Sayeed, as home minister, admitted that he had asked the then Bihar Chief Minister Lalu Yadav to release LK Advani

 '' ek acchhee khabar he
 The good news is that all the problems in our country are over
 sirf ek samasya bachi he
 After the end of poverty, unemployment, malnutrition, road, hospital problems, only one work is left
 wo ye ki ham yaa aap kya khaayen
 This will save time at home and GDP will increase
 jaldi hi koi raajnneetik dal rose aapke liye personal menu banaakar whatsap karne lagegaa
 i think you should also call the office of a political party before cooking and ask what to make today
 party aphis se bataaya jayega ki maansaahaar main bif bain he
 Mutton is not banned
 kisi dal se yah bhi puch sakate hai ki bhindi pakaa len yaa matan frai parason vaala kha len
 Add asafoetida or cumin seeds to the lentils
 acha suniye phone mat rakhiye
 
 
 Also tell me what should i give in the baby's tiffin tomorrow
 anda yaa tamaato kii sabji
 Since i am the anchor, parties will send me cooked and packed then it will be fine
 maharashtra main meet bain ko lekar jo raajnneeti ho rahi he or jis tarah kii bhashaa kaa istamaal ho rahaa he usase lag rahaa he ki ek din khaanaa bain karne ke baad samudaayon ko bhi bain kiya jayega
 Currently in Mumbai, Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena workers were seen selling chicken for some time
 ye himmat agar kisi tathakthith secular dal ne kii hoti to channelon ke zariye pravaktaaon ne dhaava bol diya hota
 Often the controversy of vegetarianism versus non-vegetarianism turns into Muslim opposition
 hindutvvaadi partiyaan sabhi hinduon ko shaakaahaari paint karne lagati hai
 But Shiv Sena and MNS made it clear that Marathi manush is Hindu but non-vegetarian
 shivasena ke netaa tivi par bol rahe hai ki karodon log maansaahaar karte hai
 In support of their right to eat, the Shiv Sena even set up a chicken cart
 aisa karne main secular dalon ke to haath kaanpane lagate
 But Shiv Sena MNS has a problem in this courage
 agar ye donon khaane kii azaadi kii vakaalat kar rahi hai to phir musalamaanon or isaayiyon ke khaane kii azaadi kaa sawaal alag kaise ho jaataa he
 Eating beef from Muslims and Christians hurts Hindu faith, so eating meat from Marathi Manush, who are also Hindus, cannot hurt the faith of the Jain community
 khaane par pratibandh kii raajnneeti kaa sambandh sidhaa sidhaa kattarta se he
 If you approve one form of bigotry, then another form of it has to be accepted
 kattarta kaa samarthak bhi kattarta kaa shikaar ho saktaa he is maamle se saaf ho jaataa he
 For example, when Muslims and Christians were targeted for beef ban, the Jain community would always be counted towards the Hindutva brigade
 ab unheen hindutv partiyon ke nishane par jain aa gaye hai
 In both these cases one thing is common
 wo ye ki musalmaan, isai or jain teenon alpsankhyak hai
 Jains, like Muslims, are targeting at least in political parlance
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne party mukhpatr saamana main likhaa he, 'jain dharmaandh na bane
 His fanatic mentality will make him an enemy of Hindus
 bilkul vaise hi jaise dharmaandh musalmaan hinduon ke dushman ban gaye
 Therefore, Paryusan should not be celebrated
 paryushan main hinsa naa karne kaa aagrah karte jain kya in dinon blike mani lenaa band kar denge
 Most builders in Mumbai are Jain
 kya ve apane saude main paryushan kaal main kaala dhan nahin lenge
 Violence also occurs in thoughts
 yaad rakhen ki 92-93 ke dangon main is jain samaaj ke kaarobaar kii raksha shivasena ne kii thi
 And also do not forget that it will not take long for us to uproot the business of Jain people
 isliye kah detaa hum ki jise jo khaanaa he, khaane do
 ' aisi dhamkee kisi samaaj ko or kisi ko etraz tak nahin
 Is not the appeasement of Marathi manus in the name of protesting the appeasement of Jain society
 jaise muslim tushtikaran ke naam par hindu tushtikaran hota he
 The Shiv Sena is a BJP ally in Maharashtra and the Center, threatening to destroy the Jain Samaj empire
 modi sarkaar main shivasena kaa mantri he
 In Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena is running a government consisting of the BJP
 hindu muslim vaala maamla hota to secular ko sicular bataakar twit karne vaale bhaade ke deshbhakt aa jate lekin jain samaaj ko aisi dhamkee ke baad bhi chuppi nazar aati he
 This question should also be asked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that your ally party is threatening to ruin Jain society
 kya aap koi twit karenge
 How the BJP, which banned meat during paryushan in Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat, sees these things happening against the Jain community in Mumbai
 kya wo bhi chup he jaise jain chup nazar aate hai
 Is it silent that its social leaders cannot stand against the politics of muslim-christian opposition or is silent that no one will listen to them
 kya is mulk main hameshaa bahusankhyak tay karegaa
 Whether the minority will never get the benefit of politics of deciding
 paryushan parv aath se das dinon tak chalane vaala parv he
 Somewhere there is a meat ban of two days, then four days and somewhere eight days
 chikan, matan par bain he, machhlee par bain nahin
 Did the fish jump from the officers' file and jumped into the sea from Marine Drive
 dilli sahit puure uttar bharat main navaratri or sawan ke maheene main badi sankhya main log maansaahaar band kar dete hai
 In Bihar, carnivore stops during Chhath but no ban
 is tarah kii maang kii bhi apni ek samasya he
 Now it is coming out that where there is a majority of influential people of Gujarati, Marwari and Jain society in Mumbai six, there is not a single store of meat
 yah apane aap ho gaya yaa kisi maansaahaari restraan ko khulne nahin diya gaya
 Actually everyone is killed due to his bigotry
 lekin maansaahaar par bain koi nai baat nahin he
 On the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, non-vegetarian food is banned
 is tarah suchi lambii ho sakati he
 The MNS had passed a resolution that the builder who does not sell flats to a non-vegetarian would take action
 internet se pataa chalaa ki 2012 main karnataka rajya ke up mukhyamantri ke
 s
 ishwarappa gandhi jayanti ke din maansaahaar karte dekhe gaye to congress ne unke khilaaf rajyapal ko yachika di ki unhen turant barkhaast kar diya jaae kyonki unhone gandhivadiyon kii bhaavana ko thes pahunchaai he
 K
 es
 Eshwarappa was the president of the Karnataka BJP
 tippaniyan Meanwhile, the matter has also reached the Mumbai High Court
 shuukravaar ko bhi is par sunwaayee hogi
 The court, in its opening remarks, stated that a four-day ban on killing animals and selling meat for the Jain festival is not practical for a metropolitan city like Mumbai
 meet par aisi sidhi pabandi koi formula nahin ho sakati
 There is a ban on killing and selling meats
 anya sroton kaa kya? bazaar main pehle se maujuud packaged meet kaa kya hoga? He should also have a problem with the portrayal of Jain society by Uddhav Thackeray
 sabhi ko to honi hi chahie
 But most of the builders in Mumbai are Jains and they take black money
 All of them with a waiting list of fifteen lakhs do not start saying that till the time they come from abroad, they should give away the Jain ones
 mazaaq alag he
 This is not going well
 mujhe lagata he ki aapako bhi khaanaa banane se pehle kisi political party ke daftar phone kar poochna chahie ki aaj kya bananaa he
 It will be told from the party office that there is a beef ban in the meat
 matan bain nahin he
 You can also ask any party to cook okra or eat mutton fry the day after tomorrow
 daal main hing se chhaunk lagaaein yaa jire kii chhaunk
 Well listen, do not hang up
 
 
 ye bhi bataa dijie na kal bachche ke tiffin main kya duun
 Egg or Tomato Vegetable
 chunki main ankar hum isliye partiyaan mujhe pakaa pakaaya pack kar bhijwa den to thik rahegaa
 The politics that is happening about meat ban in Maharashtra and the kind of language that is being used, it seems that after banning food one day, communities will also be banned
 philhal mumbai main kuch samay ke liye shivasena or maharashtra nav nirmaan sena ke kaaryakarta chikan bechate nazar aae
 If any so-called secular party had done this courage, the spokespersons would have attacked through the channels
 aksar shaakaahaar banaam maansaahaar kaa vivaad muslim virodh main badal jaataa he
 Hindutva parties tend to paint all Hindus as vegetarian
 lekin shivasena or manase ne yah saaf kar diya ki marathi maanush hindu to he magar maansaahaari he
 Shiv Sena leaders are speaking on TV that crores of people eat meat
 unke khaane ke adhikaar ke samarthan main shivasena ne chikan kaa thela tak laga diya
 In doing so, the hands of the secular parties started shaking
 lekin shivasena manase ke is saahas main ek samasya he
 If both of them are advocating the freedom of food, then how does the question of freedom of food of Muslims and Christians become different
 musalmaan or isai ke bif khaane se hindu aasthaa ko thes pahunchati he to is lihaaz se marathi maanush, jo ki hindu bhi hai, ke meet khaane se jain samudaay kii aasthaa aahat nahin ho sakati he
 The politics of food ban is directly related to bigotry
 agar aap kattarta ke ek rup ko manzuri denge to iske duusare swaroop ko bhi maananaa padegaa
 The supporter of bigotry can also be a victim of bigotry, this is clear from this case
 jaise jab bif bain ko lekar musalamaanon or isaayiyon ko target kiya gaya to jain samudaay hameshaa hindutv brigade kii taraf gin liya jaataa hoga
 Now the Jains have come on the target of those Hindutva parties
 in donon maamle main ek chiz kaaman he
 That is, Muslims, Christians and Jains are the three minorities
 jain bhi musalamaanon kii tarah kam se kam raajnneetik bolchaal main target ho rahe hai
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray wrote in the party mouthpiece Saamana, 'don't become a Jain fanatic
 unki dharmaandh maansikta unhen hinduon kaa dushman bana degi
 Just as fanatical Muslims became enemies of Hindus
 isliye paryushan kaa aadambar na kiya jaae
 Will Jain stop taking black money these days, urging him not to commit violence in Paryushan
 mumbai main zyaadaatar builder jain hai
 Will they not take black money in their deal during the period hinsa vichaaron main bhi hoti he
 Remember that in the 92-93 riots, the business of this Jain society was protected by the Shiv Sena
 or ye bhi naa bhoolen ki jain logon ke kaarobaar ko ukhaad phenkane main hamen zyaada samay nahin lagegaa
 Therefore, let me say that whatever you want to eat, let it be eaten
 ' Such a threat is not against anyone and society
 kya jain samaaj ke tushtikaran ke virodh ke naam par marathi maanush kaa tushtikaran nahin ho rahaa he
 Like Hindu appeasement in the name of Muslim appeasement
 jain samaaj ke samrajya ko nasht karne kii dhamkee dene vaali shivasena maharashtra or centre main bijepi kii sahyogi party he
 Shiv Sena is a minister in Modi government
 maharashtra main shivasena bijepi se milakar sarkaar chalaa rahi he
 Had it been the case of a Hindu Muslim, the patriots of the mercenaries who had tweeted as secular would have come, but even after such a threat to the Jain society, there is silence
 yah sawaal to pradhanmantri narendra modi se bhi poocha janaa chahie ki aapaki sahyogi party jain samaaj ko barbaad karne kii dhamkee de rahi he
 Will you make a tweet? haryana, rajasthan or gujarat main paryushan ke dauraan meet bain karne vaali bijepi mumbai main jain samaaj ke khilaaf ho rahi in baton ko kaise dekhati he
 Is he also silent as Jain appears silent
 kya isliye chup he ki uske saamaajik netaa muslim-isai virodh kii raajnneeti ke khilaaf khadey na ho sake yaa isliye chup hai ki unki koi nahin sunegaa
 Will the majority always decide in this country
 kya tay karne kii raajnneeti kaa laabh kabhi bhi alpsankhyak ko nahin milegaa
 Paryushan is a festival lasting eight to ten days
 kahin do din kaa meet bain he to kahin chaar din to kahin aath din
 Chicken is a ban on mutton, not a ban on fish
 machhlee kya afasaron kii file se uchhal kar marine drive se samandar main kud gai
 a large number of people stop carnivores during the month of Navratri and Sawan in North India including Delhi
 bihar main chhath ke dauraan maansaahaar band ho jaataa he lekin koi bain nahin karata
 Such demand also has its own problem
 ab yah baat nikal kar aa rahi he ki mumbai chah main jahaan gujarati, marwari or jain samaaj ke prabhaavshaalee logon kaa bahumat he vahaan ek bhi dukaan maansaahaar kaa nahin he
 It happened on its own or no non-vegetarian restaurant was allowed to open
 darasal sab apni apni kattarta ke maare hai
 But the ban on meat is not new
 ganesh chaturthi ke din bhi maansaahaar par roak hoti he
 This way the list can be long
 manase ne to prastaav paas kiya tha ki jo builder kisi maansaahaari ko flats nahin bechega uske khilaaf karrwai hogi
 The internet showed that in 2012 the Deputy Chief Minister of Karnataka State
 es
 When Ishwarappa was seen eating meat on the day of Gandhi Jayanti, the Congress petitioned the Governor against him that he should be sacked immediately as he had hurt the spirit of Gandhians
 ke
 s
 ishwarappa karnataka bhaajapa ke adhyaksh the
 The comments is bich yah maamla mumbai hoicourt bhi pahunch gaya he
 It will be heard on Friday as well

 maarane or meet bechney par pabandi he

 maharashtra main meet bain ko lekar jo raajnneeti ho rahi he or jis tarah kii bhashaa kaa istamaal ho rahaa he usase lag rahaa he ki ek din khaanaa bain karne ke baad samudaayon ko bhi bain kiya jayega
 Currently in Mumbai, Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena workers were seen selling chicken for some time
 ye himmat agar kisi tathakthith secular dal ne kii hoti to channelon ke zariye pravaktaaon ne dhaava bol diya hota
 Often the controversy of vegetarianism versus non-vegetarianism turns into Muslim opposition
 hindutvvaadi partiyaan sabhi hinduon ko shaakaahaari paint karne lagati hai
 But Shiv Sena and MNS made it clear that Marathi manush is Hindu but non-vegetarian
 shivasena ke netaa tivi par bol rahe hai ki karodon log maansaahaar karte hai
 In support of their right to eat, the Shiv Sena even set up a chicken cart
 aisa karne main secular dalon ke to haath kaanpane lagate
 But Shiv Sena MNS has a problem in this courage
 agar ye donon khaane kii azaadi kii vakaalat kar rahi hai to phir musalamaanon or isaayiyon ke khaane kii azaadi kaa sawaal alag kaise ho jaataa he
 Eating beef from Muslims and Christians hurts Hindu faith, so eating meat from Marathi Manush, who are also Hindus, cannot hurt the faith of the Jain community
 khaane par pratibandh kii raajnneeti kaa sambandh sidhaa sidhaa kattarta se he
 If you approve one form of bigotry, then another form of it has to be accepted
 kattarta kaa samarthak bhi kattarta kaa shikaar ho saktaa he is maamle se saaf ho jaataa he
 For example, when Muslims and Christians were targeted for beef ban, the Jain community would always be counted towards the Hindutva brigade
 ab unheen hindutv partiyon ke nishane par jain aa gaye hai
 In both these cases one thing is common
 wo ye ki musalmaan, isai or jain teenon alpsankhyak hai
 Jains, like Muslims, are targeting at least in political parlance
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne party mukhpatr saamana main likhaa he, 'jain dharmaandh na bane
 His fanatic mentality will make him an enemy of Hindus
 bilkul vaise hi jaise dharmaandh musalmaan hinduon ke dushman ban gaye
 Therefore, Paryusan should not be celebrated

 Violence also occurs in thoughts
 yaad rakhen ki 92-93 ke dangon main is jain samaaj ke kaarobaar kii raksha shivasena ne kii thi
 And also do not forget that it will not take long for us to uproot the business of Jain people
 isliye kah detaa hum ki jise jo khaanaa he, khaane do

 in donon maamle main ek chiz kaaman he
 That is, Muslims, Christians and Jains are the three minorities
 jain bhi musalamaanon kii tarah kam se kam raajnneetik bolchaal main target ho rahe hai
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray wrote in the party mouthpiece Saamana, 'don't become a Jain fanatic
 unki dharmaandh maansikta unhen hinduon kaa dushman bana degi
 Just as fanatical Muslims became enemies of Hindus
 isliye paryushan kaa aadambar na kiya jaae
 Will Jain stop taking black money these days, urging him not to commit violence in Paryushan
 mumbai main zyaadaatar builder jain hai
 Will they not take black money in their deal during the period hinsa vichaaron main bhi hoti he
 Remember that in the 92-93 riots, the business of this Jain society was protected by the Shiv Sena
 or ye bhi naa bhoolen ki jain logon ke kaarobaar ko ukhaad phenkane main hamen zyaada samay nahin lagegaa
 Therefore, let me say that whatever you want to eat, let it be eaten
 ' Such a threat is not against anyone and society

 Had it been the case of a Hindu Muslim, the patriots of the mercenaries who had tweeted as secular would have come, but even after such a threat to the Jain society, there is silence

 The bribe was given by the cabinet minister, another minister Satinder Jain
 kapil mishra kii press varta kii badi baaten :--ye hamaari party he, meri party he kisi bhi haalat main koi bhi vyakti aisa nahin he jo hamen baahar kar sake, ham ise kabhi chhodkar nahin jaaenge
 -if the dirt has come inside the party, then we have come to Bapu's tomb to start cleaning and running a broom
 -ye party eemaandaaree ke liye or karpshan ke khilaaf sangharsh karne waalon kii party he
 - i am the only minister in the entire cabinet who has no corruption case nor is it under investigation, not a single case is against me for the last two years
 -mujhe hataane ke liye kaha gaya he ki dilli ke kuch ilaakon main pani kii kuch samasya aa rahi thi isliye hataaya gaya lekin do saal main jab bhi kejariwal or sisodiya ne apane bayanon main pani par baat kii to tarif hi kii to kya wo tab dilli kii janata ko gumraah kar rahe the
 i know what happened after the letter i wrote to ACB against Sheila Dixit within a month of becoming the minister, i still stand on it
 -log kah rahe hai ki main mantri pad se hatane ke baad bol rahaa hum lekin aisa nahin he
 i am already speaking to him when he was not removed, after the letter to ACB went to meet Kejriwal and told him everything
 mere bolne ke baad mujhe hataaya gaya he na ki hatane ke baad main bol rahaa hum
 -I have also been a sin
 hamane chizon ko dekha
 Many kinds of cases and cases came but it was believed that a man is honest and that is Arvind Kejriwal, because no one can buy him
 -jab bhi aisa koi maamla saamne aayaa ham chup rahe kyonki hamen bharosa tha ki kejariwal ji ko jab pataa chalegaa to wo sab thik kar denge
 Perhaps Kejriwal does not know all this
 -parason(shuukravaar ko) maine apni ankhon se dekha he ki satendra jain ji ne kejariwal ko do karod rupee nakad die
 i asked what is this, then Kejriwal ji said that there are some things in politics that are told only when the time is right - i told Kejriwal that you apologize, mistakes happen but when Kejriwal did not break the silence on this, i i have come in front of everyone
 -mani lodring ke maamle main, satendra jain ke bare main kai jaankariyaan hai jo sabko maaloom he
 How the daughter and relatives were kept in the post
 ye sabko maaloom he
 -satendra Jain himself told that he made a deal of 50 crore land for Kejriwal's relative
 maine tab kejariwal ji se poocha to unhone kaha ki tumhen mujhapar bharosa nahin he
 Then i said trust but now i have seen the cache with my eyes
 -kursi jaati he to jaae, praan chale jaaen to bhi chup nahin rahoonga, chup kabhi bhi nahin rahoonga
 -why is Kejriwal trying to save Satinder Jain's corruption? Earlier, Jitendra Tomar was given the certificate to be correct and now this certificate is being given to Satendra Jain

 aam aadmi party ne emsidi ke ek adhikari kaa shikayati khat jari kiya hai, jisamen meyar priti agarwal par bhrashtachar karne kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has demanded the dismissal of Preity Agarwal
 10 maheene pehle bijepi ne dilli main apane sabhi puraane parshadon ke tikat katkar ek dam nae chehron ko nagar nigam chunaav maidan main utaara
 The attempt was to create a new image apart from the corruption of the Municipal Corporation, but it did not take even a year and the bjp's North Delhi Municipal Corporation was surrounded by allegations of corruption
 aam aadmi party ne nagar nigam ke ek varisht adhikari kii nagar nigam kamishnar ko kii gai likhit shikaayat ke aadhaar par aarope lagaaya ki 13 november 2017 ko ek security sarvice ke tender ke technical bid kholane ke dauraan meyar priti agarwal tender prakriya vaale kamare main ghusi or tender prakriya main dakhal diya or saare kaagazat apane daphtar main dene ko kaha jo ki avaidh he
 In the complaint letter issued by the Aam Aadmi Party, the officer has also accused Preeti Agarwal of transfer posting in the Education Department
 adhikari ne kamishnar ko likhe khat main is baat kaa bhi zikr kiya he ki meyar ne kuch samay pehle apane ghar par bhavy dinar party kaa bhi aayojan kiya tha, jisapar 5 lakh kaa kharch aayaa or ye dinar kii pement niyamon ke khilaaf hui
 There have also been allegations of misconduct with the officer for raising his voice against these acts of the mayor
 aap ne meyar ko turant bijepi se barkhaast karne or unke khilaaf sibiai jaanch kii maang kii he
 The matter is constantly gaining momentum and this is affecting the image of the BJP, which has won the trust of the people with the help of new faces, new energy and new flight
 duusari taraf bijepi meyar priti agarwal ne aam aadmi party ke tamaam aaropon ko niraadhaar bataaya he
 Agarwal has challenged that she will soon file a defamation case against the leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party who are tarnishing her name
 jaahir he donon hi paksh ek duusare kaa istipha maang rahe hai
 But none of the parties are responding impartially to the allegations leveled against them

 Sanjay Hegde Some time ago during a heritage walk (memorial tour) in Delhi i went to see Humayun's tomb with some friends

 Nizamuddin police station was on the other side of the road in front of where we were standing
 uski ore ishaara karte hue unhone kaha, ''apatkaal ke dauraan tumhaare daddy ko giraftaar karke usee thane main rakhaa gaya tha
 "her famous political husband was a student leader at Jawaharlal Nehru University in those days
 baad main apane daftar main noujvaan vakeelon se baat karte hue maine unhen maa-bete ke bich hua samvaad sunaaya or unke saamne ek sawaal rakhaa, ''kalpana karen ki aise hi halaat main mujhe hiraasat main le liya gaya he or aapako supreme court main, jahaan main roj practice karata hum, meri jamaanat ke liye rit yachika deni he
 
 
 You tell me the names of the judges in front of whom you will get the bail order if you put the petition
 '' shaayad aapane andaja laga liya he ki is sawaal kaa jawaab bahut utsahjanak nahin tha
 The reason for putting this story of your office in front of you is that at present, many lawyers across the country are in jail without trial and the courts are apparently unable to release them
 vichaaradhin maamalon main 'jail nahin, jamaanat' buniyadi niyam he, phir bhi jaanch agenciyaan ise saamaanya ghatnakram maanate hue anaavashyak or nazaij giraftaaryaan karti hai
 He is perhaps encouraged to do so by the fact that in most cases the courts refuse to grant bail
 hamaari adaalatein kisi ko jamaanat par chhodie ko laabh kii sthiti maanati hai or jaanch adhuri rahane ke maamalon main kisi aparaadh ke unheen aropiyon ko apvadswarup jamaanat par chhodie kaa aadesh detii hai jo unki drushti main iske liye sarvaadhik yogya hote hai
 For this reason, even the famous lawyers cannot be confident of their independence if the executive is acting on political gestures and is motivated to keep them in custody, inspired by the spirit of revenge

 Advocate Sudha Bhardwaj, who quit the proposal to be a judge in the High Court to work for the benefit of tribes and tribals, leaving US citizenship, has also been in jail since August 2018 in the same case, although she too was not at the time of the incident

 Chidambaram has been in jail since early September 2019
 sibiai ke darj maamle main sarvocch nyaayalay ne unhen jamaanat de di thi phir bhi ve diwaali or uske baad bhi jail main hai kyonki jin tathyon ke aadhaar par sibiai ne unke khilaaf maamla darj kiya tha, unheen ke aadhaar par pravartan nideshaalay (idi) ne bhi unke khilaaf ek anya maamla darj kar rakhaa he
 The arrest in the ED case was made at such a time to ensure that even if the Supreme Court grants bail in the CBI case, they cannot be released until they get bail in the other case as well
 jab vyavastha ne gadling ko jail bheje jane ke maamle ko chupchaap sweekaar kar liya tabhi is baat ke sanket mil gaye the ki bharadwaj or chidambaram jaise duusare log bhi aisi hi kamjor sthiti main hai
 Freedom is inseparable, and those who bear the weight of its protection often fail to understand that whatever they allow them to do against underrepresented and under-resourced citizens, the latter is something that people like them Can be done against
 supreme court to apane hi nyaayadhishon kii suraksha ke liye khadaa nahin hua he
 In 2011, Justice Jayant Patel of the Gujarat High Court ordered a CBI inquiry into the Ishrat Jahan case
 2016 main unhen karnataka ucch nyaayalay main sthanantarit kar diya gaya
 He was then transferred to Allahabad in 2017, which prevented him from becoming acting Chief Justice in Karnataka
 iske baad unhone pad se istipha dene kaa rasta chunaa
 a similar incident occurred in 2019 when the Supreme Court recommended the transfer of Chief Justice Vijaya Tahilramani of the Madras High Court to Meghalaya
 san 2010 main gujarat hycourt ke nyaayamurti aakil kureshi ne soharabuddin shaikh maamle main amit shah ko sibiai kii hiraasat main dene kaa faisla kiya tha
 The consequences of this decision have been negatively affecting his professional life ever since
 unhen mumbai hycourt main sthanantarit kar diya gaya jisase ve gujarat hycourt ke kaaryvahak mukhya nyaayadhish nahin ban sake
 His name was suggested to the Chief Justice of Madhya Pradesh High Court, but the Central Government did not act on the recommendation of the collegium
 collegium ne ab unhen tripura kaa mukhya nyaayadhish banane kii sanstuti kii he lekin us sanstuti ko bhi sarkaar lataka rahi he
 Thus, the power of judicial appointments and transfers that judges have been guarding as a sign of judicial independence has also been rendered non-existent due to stubborn executive and silent judiciary

 An example of Pakistan can better describe this point
 san 1954 main pakistan ke mukhya nyaayadhish mohammad munir ne governor general malik gulam mohammad kii ore se samvidhansabha kii barkhaastagi ko vaid tehraane ke liye 'aavashyaktaa kaa siddhant' lagu kiya
 He cited Brechton's theory, "what is not otherwise valid is made legal by necessity" - and in this way he started a whole series of actions to legitimize the power grab

 Healthy skepticism, identified by judicial review, is being replaced by voluntary suspension of antitrust
 soshal media vikalpon ke is yug main, bharatiyon main swatantraaa kii bhaavana ko tyaagane kii pravriti badhati ja rahi he
 In a famous speech during the grueling World War II era, Justice Billings Learned Hand defined it as "a feeling that is not quite sure whether it is right or not; a feeling of freedom is a feeling that tries to understand other people's minds; The spirit of freedom is the feeling that weighs the interests of others without prejudice
 '' ve itane par nahin ruke or unhone chetavanee bhi di: ''swatantraaa logon ke dil main rahati he; or, yah jab vahaan mar jaati he, to, koi samvidhan, koi kanoon, koi adaalat ise nahin bachaa sakati; koi samvidhan, koi kanoon yaa koi bhi adaalat isaki madad main bhi bahut kuch nahin kar sakati
 "does independent India value its independence with its true spirit, or is it satisfied only with ostentatious freedom? The answer is not to come from the courts of India but from the people

 The conflict between Kangana and Tapsee is obvious

 Copying such an amazing actress is no less than a complement

 ’faisle kii tippaniyon ko mahatvapurn bataate hue varisht adhivaktaa rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki is par paanch nyaayadhishon kii peeth dwaara punarvichaar karne kii jarurat he or faisle main islam main masjid kii sthiti jaise pahaluon par in visangatiyon ko durust kiye bina divaani apil par prabhavi tareeke se faisla nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 He said, "despite the demolition, a mosque remains a mosque and belongs to Allah
 ’’1994 ke faisle ke kuch paragraph kaa ullekh karte hue dhawan ne kaha, ‘‘sheersh adaalat ne kaha tha ki namaaj padhanaa yaa ibaadat karnaa dharmik kriya he
 Performing this work at any place where namaz can be recited will not be an essential or integral part of such a religious practice as long as that place has special significance for that religion, so that it has an essential or integral part
 'unhone kaha ki faisle main kaha gaya tha ki ekbar masjid ke liye arpit kar diya gaya to vah hameshaa masjid ke taur par ibaadat sthal bana rahegaa, yah bharat kii wo muslim vidhi nahin he, jise bhartiya adaalaton ne manjuuri di he
 The court had said, "religious worship sites such as mosques, churches, temples can be acquired under the sovereign powers of the state on condition of protection under Article 25 and Article 26 of the Constitution
" ’’dhawan ne 1994 ke faisle ko uddhrut karte hue kaha, ‘‘is tarah kaa adhigrahan swat: anuchhed 25 yaa anuchhed 26 kaa ulanghan nahin karte hai
 Taking management under its control has no effect on the sovereign powers of the state in relation to the acquisition of property
 ’’dhawan ne faisle kaa hawala dete hue kaha, ‘‘yah bilkul alag maamla he ki kshetra kaa ab adhigrahan kar liya gaya he
 Can you say that if a mosque is demolished then it is no longer a mosque
 ’’unhone kaha ki 1994 ke faisle main kaha gaya tha ki puja kaa moulik adhikaar puja ke sthal tak nahin failaa hua he
 Lawyers representing Ram Lala and Nirmohi Akhara opposed this argument and said that the 1994 verdict had nothing to do with the current case

 'sabase mjedaar yah he ki is gaanv main muslim samudaay kaa ek bhi ghar nahin he
 All families belong to Santhal tribals

 Murmu said that he wants to make Modi the Prime Minister so that he can teach a lesson to the peace-loving country of Pakistan
 unhone kaha, 'keval modi hi aisa kar sakate hai
 'purnia will go to polls on April 24
 ek police adhikari ke mutabik, sarkari ricard main bhi is gaanv kaa naam pakistan he
 Asked how the village was named Pakistan, the elders of the village said that it was renamed Pakistan soon after partition in 1947

 The ruckus on Narendra Modi's statement of 'papi' has not stopped
 bijepi ne aarope lagaaya he ki congress ne bayaan ko galat rup main pesh kiya or party ke netaaon ko iske liye maafee maangani chahie
 Read Modi's complete interview, BJP spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi said, "those who misrepresent the statement should apologize

 Modi meant that when we are hurt even by the injury to a child of a dog, it would be very painful to see people getting hurt

 The BJP spokesperson said that this is also an example of the Congress' policy of polarization
 unhone kaha, 'congress yah dharna bananaa chaahati he ki musalamaanon ko jhuthe maamalon main fansaaya jaataa he
 The Congress and its allies want to instill a false sense of insecurity among Muslims and are therefore working against the mainstream of all citizens

 pichley ek saal main is vajah se pakistan seemaa par koi badi vaardaat nahin kar paaya he
 Yes, the former army chief, General Dalbir Singh Suhag, believes that the surgical strike has had a similar effect
 general dalbir singh suhaag ne ek samachar agency se baatcheet main kaha, 'sargical strike rashtriya gaurav kii ghatana rahi he or isse rashtriya or antarrashtriya str par desh kii pratishtha kai guna bad gai he
 The surgical strike has been very successful and the pm's decision to approve it was quite a bold decision
 ' unhone kaha ki june 2015 main myanmar main sargical strike kiya gaya tha or iske baad phir sitambar 2016 main pakistan main sargical strike kiya gaya
 It is worth noting that on the night of 28-29 September a year ago, Hindustan told the world that it is determined to kill the enemy by entering into his house
 bharat ke jaanbaaj sainikon ne elosi ke paar jaakar aatankiyon ke thikaanon ko tahas-nahas kar diya
 The world saluted this courage of India
 sargical strike ke khulaase ke baad america ne bharat ko bhi apana samarthan doharaate hue jor diya tha ki pakistan ko aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladanaa chahie
 This was how the surgical strike took place at about twelve o'clock from Poonch on board the Advanced Light Helicopter Dhruv, 25 commandos of 4 and 9 paras entered Pakistan in Pakistan
 niyantran rekha ke paar helicopter ne in javaanon ko ek sunsaan jagah utaar diya
 There was danger everywhere
 pakistani sena kii firing kii ashanka ke bich in commandos ne takreeban teen kilometre kaa faasla reng kar tay kiya
 To create havoc in the country, the launch pads of the terrorists were located here in the areas of Bhimbar, Kel, Tattapani and Lipa
 pakistani sena ko bharat ke is kadam kaa koi abhas nahin hua
 Before the attack, the intelligence agencies had been monitoring the launching pads of the terrorists for a week

 Osama raped me, Osama kidnapped me, Osama made my life hell, i watched Osama six months closest
 ye kahana he sudani mul kii cola bu kaa
 The truth of Kola Bu's life is that Osama bin Laden kidnapped Kola Bu and kept it in his harem
 1972 main janmi kol bu apni kitaab main likhti hai ki 1996 main jab main north africa main apana film kariyar bana rahi thi to osama ke saathiyon ne meraa apharan kar liya
 i was housed at La Mansion Arab Hotel in Marrakesh in Morocco
 yahaan chaar maheene tak mere saath laden ne balaatkaar kiya
 Then somehow i escaped from it and reached Spain
 spain main rah kar maine apana kavita sangrah 'evari little bit hart' prakashit kiya
 So Laden read this and threatened to kill me
 iske baad cola bu laden se apni jaan bachaane ke liye idhar se udhar bhaagti raheen unhen america sarkaar ne suraksha di or vahiin ke ek ashwet ne unase shaadi bhi kar lee
 In a book called Diary of Lost Girl, Kola states that he initially loved Laden
 cola bu ne kaha, 'mere liye wo sabase brilient aadmi tha
 'but slowly his face was exposed and then he was nothing more than a rapist for Cola
 cola bu kii maane to laden ko khud main divine shaktiyon ke hone kaa mugalata tha or wo puri duniya ko thik karne kaa sapana dekhtaa tha
 Cola's life brought many sorrows due to Laden
 cola ko apane bachche ko ek skool se isliye hataanaa padaa kyonki uskaa cheharaa osama bin laden se miltaa tha
 Kola said that he can kill him who is as vicious as him
 america cills ne osama ko maar giraaya he or ab shaayad cola raahat mahasoos kar rahi hon
 But the hell they have suffered because of the laden, they hardly leave their life with them

 When they saw this bird, they found that there was a plastic ring on its beak
 jisaki vajah se ye pakshi kuch bhi khaane-pine main sakasham nahin tha
 He was also unable to open his mouth due to the trapped rings
 vanyajeev premi or van adhikari vilupt ho rahi prajati ke ek pakshi ko bachaane kii koshish kar rahe the, taaki jald se jald pakshi ko sahi salaamat pakad len
 When seen, this bird, named Black-necked Stark, was first seen on 7 June in a marshy ground outside Delhi in the scorching heat of Delhi

 Gupta told that this is a extinct species of birds
 lekin keede or machhlee khaane kii talash main aise 50 se 60 pakshi dilli ke baahar vaale daldali ilaakon main aate hai

 However, there has been a ruckus in the political corridor after seeing the list of 45 candidates issued by their names and seal on the letterpad of a responsible Congress official

 But the list was leaked before the party was sent to the high command

 ) Two days after the body was found in the bathroom of a couple's house in Indirapuram, Ghaziabad, the family members have not filed a complaint in the police station
 police ko ummid thi ki postmortem report se unhen kuch suraag milegaa, lekin postmortem report main maut kaa kaaran spasht nahin ho paaya he
 Police has sent the two to Agra lab for forensic examination
 ab tak kii tamaam jaanch ke baad ashanka jataai ja rahi he ki donon kii maut kisi jehar kii vajah se hui ho
 And the poison will be detected only after the investigation
 gyaat ho ki beete shuukravaar ko holi ke din hai profile company main kaam karne vaale niraj or ruchi singhania kaa nirvastr shav unke bathroom se mila tha
 No evidence of murder or suicide has come to light in this case so far
 shuruuaati jaanch ke baad aisa prathit hota he ki bathroom main lage gijar kii gas li hone ke baad dam ghutane se unki maut hui he
 The death took place 3 hours before the doctors arrived
 The team of the deceased reached the doctors of Max Hospital who reached the spot first
 unki team ne jayja liya tha
 Doctor Dheeraj Bhaskar told Aaj Tak that when his team reached the spot, the bodies of both of them were dressed there
 ek body ko car main rakh diya gaya tha, jabaki ek body ghar ke daravaaje par rakhi hui thi
 That is, there is something behind this death that is still behind the curtain
 doctor kaa kahana he ki us vakt tak donon kii laashen thandi pad chuki thim, yani maut kam se kam do se teen ghante pehle hi ho chuki thi
 Police are looking for answers to these questions
 The death of this beautiful couple with a high profile job has remained a mystery for the police till now
 police is gutthi ko sulajhane ke liye kai angel se jaanch kar rahi he
 However, there are some questions related to the incident which need to be answered
 ab tak donon kii maut ke peeche sabase vaazib vajah gijar se gas kaa li hona bataaya ja rahaa he
 But the important question is that how can the effect of gas be the same on both husband and wife? If the death is attributed to food poisoning, then the victim struggles in that situation
 lekin ghatana sthal par sangharsh ke koi nishaan nahin mili hai
 Both have not vomited before death, so the possibility of food poisoning is also negligible
 police ko maukey se dawaaiyon ke kuch raper mili hai, lekin vah davaaiyaan hi maut kaa kaaran he, abhi yah saaf nahin hua he or na hi postmortem report main aisa kuch saamne aayaa he
 The question of how the two died together is also troubling the police
 media se duuri banaae hue he parivaravahin duusari taraf peedit parivaar puri tarah se media se duuri banaae hue he
 According to police sources, the family is not even demanding an investigation from the police
 or to or gharavaalon ne donon ke tamaamsoshal media ke account bhi blocokar die hai, jin par maut ke baad unke dost coment likhakar samvednaa vyakt kar rahe the
 Geysers can be the cause of death
 If Xpert is to be believed, LPG geyser fires cause a decrease in oxygen consumption
 iske saath hi carbon monooxide bhi banati he
 Lack of oxygen in the brain can be fatal
 is cese main bhi yahi ho saktaa he ki holi ke baad nahaane ke liye niraj or ruchi bathroom gaye ho
 They may have run geysers to heat the water
 is dauraan gijar se gas li hone kii vajah se oxigen kii kami hui ho or saans na le paane kii vajah se unki maut ho gai ho
 The post-mortem report stated death due to brain and lung blockage
 philhal police maut kii vajah jaan rahi he
 The family's denial of the use of geysers has made the case of the couple's death even more complicated because the most legitimate reason for their death is suffocation due to gas leakage from the geyser
 vahiin parijanon kaa kahana he ki donon ne gijar kaa istemaal kiya hi nahin
 Police said the dead husband and wife had no clothes on their bodies
 niraj mobile company matrix main DGM the

 This was complete Ghatnani's father Prem Prakash Singhania had told that on the evening of Holi, 5
 30 baje ke kareeb sabhi log holi khel kar laute
 His son and daughter-in-law moved into his bedroom
 ghar main maujuud baaki log apane-apane kamaron main the
 7 pm 30 baje ke kareeb unhone bade bete ke room ko nock kiya, lekin koi jawaab nahin mila
 They thought that after some time the husband and wife would wake up
 raat 9:30 baje ke kareeb waapas unhone bedroom ko nock kiya, lekin is baar bhi koi jawaab nahin mila
 After this, he told his younger son Varun, and the younger son put a stool and peeped inside the bedroom
 varun ko bathroom ke andar apni bhabhi kaa pair najar aayaa
 The family had some doubts on this
 bedroom kaa darwaja todakar ve andar ghuse to dekha ki niraj or unki ruchibathroom ke andar nirvastrbehosh pade the
 The younger brother immediately called Max Pushpanjali and called the ambulance
 unke ghar ambulance mahaj paanch minute main hi pahunch gai
 The team of the doctor accompanying the ambulance declared both dead after investigation

 The anger of Arvind Kejriwal, who contested the MCD election 'jo Kaha So Kiya', was clearly visible in the election rally in Burari on the face of Burari
 apane samarthakon ko sambodhit karte hue kejariwal ne media ko jamkar kosa
 Arvind said "the media does not show the good work of his government but only his evil"! Kejriwal's challenge to Amit Shah In his nearly 30-minute election speech, Kejriwal asked his 2-year-old Delhi government to pardon power and pardon the water
 The biggest achievement and BJP attacked the Congress as well as the media
 unhone kaha ki "main amit shah ko chalange karata hum ki wo alag-alag rajyon main chal rahe vikaas kaary par mujhase bahes kar len
 No other government has done as much work as his government has done in the last two years
 bijli half kii, pani maaf kiya, or munafa bhi kamayravind ne kaha ki jab unhone bijli half or pani maaf karne kii baat kii thi to bijepi congress ke saath-saath media ne bhi unka majaak udaaya tha lekin unki sarkaar ne ek saal ke andar apana vaada puraa kiya or jal board main 178 karod kaa munafa bhi kamakar dikhaaya
 Despite this, the media does not praise him
 itnaa ladate kyon hai kejarivashravind ne kaha ki log unase kehete hai ki kejariwal sarkaar chalaane ke bajaay ladate kyon he
 The reason behind this is that they do not want to join hands with the corrupt
 aravind ne ye phir doharaaya kii shila dikshit sarkaar bijli companiyon ke saath mili hui thi isliye bijli ke daam bad rahe the
 They fight so that the price of electricity does not increase
 dilli ke mukhyamantri ne daawa kiya ki dilli main bijli sabase sasti he
 House tax will be abolished
 Arvind Kejriwal wants to make house tax waiving a big issue for MCD elections, just like electricity water

 tab brahma, vishnu sahit sabhi devataaon ne unki stuti kar unako shant kiya or bholenath se balak ganesh ko jinda karne kaa anurodh kiya
 Mahamrityunjaya Rudra, accepting his request, revived him by attaching a one-yard severed head to Shri Ganesh's torso
 is tarah se maa gauri ko apana putr waapas mil gaya or unka krodh bhi shant ho gaya

 Suddenly, there is interest in Saadat Hasan Manto and his stories
 apane daur main upeksha ke shikaar rahe urdu ke is afasananigaar kii kahaniyon ke prakaashak nae sanskaran nikaal rahe hai
 They are being translated into English
 cinema, rangamanch, radio vaale sabhi maujuuda daur kii asaliyat jaahir karne ke liye unhen makul paa rahe hai
 It is as if Manto's impudence of telling reality is creating a magical effect in the new era
 haalanki us bebaaki ko aatmsaat kar paanaa itnaa aasaan bhi nahin he
 That is why Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who was chosen to play his character in Nandita Das's film Manto, says, "manto was unscathed in his life
 onscreen mujhe vah bebaakapan laana hi hoga
 There is no video or recording attached to them, so i am reading and writing on them and i will try to meet the people associated with them
 " film kii shooting janvari main shuru hogi lekin navazuddin ne manto kii shakhsiyat kii baarikiyaan pakadaaey kii koshish abhi se shuru kar di he jabaki manto kii bivi safia kaa kirdaar nibhaane ja raheen rasika duggal ne urdu main apni jabaan saaf kerani shuru kar di he
 She says, "I have started learning Urdu again, learned a little while ago, am learning again
" main us daur ko samajhnaa chaahati hum, jisamen manto the, us daur ke rishton ko bhi
 "on the other hand, Pankaj Kapoor's acting in Ketan Mehta's film with the same name on Toba Tek Singh is the subject of discussion
 jammu-kashmir ke poonch ke rahane vaale diarector raahat kazmi mantostan ke saath kaan se lekar kai bade film samarohon main dhooma machaae hue hai
 It is only for Manto that the film's heroine Sonal Sehgal said, "manto is our Shah Rukh Khan and also the biggest USP of our film
 "kazmi kehete hai, ''jo dard manto ne bayaan kiya, uskaa jaadui ehsaas kahin or nahin miltaa
 The common man easily associates himself with it
 " lekin vah kya baat he jisaki vajah se lahore main 18 janvari, 1955 main intikaal ke lagbhag 61 saal baad bhi manto maujuun bane hue hai? rasika duggal bataati hai, ''unki kahaniyaan aaj ke maahaul or logon ke ekadam makul hai
 She shakes you
 "bollywood kaa manto premamento kaa mumbai (tab bombai) se gaharaa naata tha
 Ashok Kumar and Shyam were his close friends
 unhone kai studio main kaam bhi kiya tha
 Although he did not achieve any major success in films, the moments in Mumbai were always close to his heart
 ab usee mumbai main unka naam gunjane laga he
 Ketan Desai, who made films like Rang Rasiya and Manjhi: The Mountain Man, chose Manto's Toba Tek Singh story to make a 75-minute film and brought Bishan Singh alive on the big screen
 haalanki abhi yah tay nahin he ki film bade parade par kab relies hogi
 In this story, the pain of the partition of the country is well shown
 film main manto kaa kirdaar bhi piroyaa gaya he jise vinay pathak nibhaa rahe hai
 Rahat Kazmi has composed four stories of Manto "khol Do", "chilled Gosht", "last Salute" and "gurmukh Singh's Will" in a film called Mantostan
 kazmi bataate hai, ''main raghuveer yadav ke saath ek film kii shooting main vyast tha
 At the same time, i read Manto's cold meat and it did not come out of my mind for several days
 raghuveer ji se baat hui
 There was no film on Manto in Bollywood
 hamane faisla kiya ki manto par film banaaenge
 "he is a Kashmiri himself and believes that similar circumstances have been observed during the peak of terrorism there
 manto kii kahaniyon main samaaj ke munh par tamaacha maarane kaa jo madda he, vah bhi bollywood ko khinchataa he
 That is why the resolved actress and director Nandita Das has taken the lead to screen Manto's life
 nandita bataati hai, ''film kii kahani 1946 se 1952—saat saal kii hogi
 "these years are not only important for India, but the existence of Manto is also an indelible impression of these years
 nandita ne bataaya, ''manto kii kissagoi kii style bahut hi saadhaaran lekin gudh he or aaj bhi praasangik he
 This is what caught my attention
 ve har us cheez kii baat karte hai jisaki mujhe parvaah he? abhivyannti kii swatantraaa, hamaare upar thopi jane vaali pahchaan
 "manto's out of the box and sense of freedom is what makes him different
 rangamanch par jaadumanto lagbhag dedh saal tak dilli main rahe or radio ke liye likhte rahe
 His pen came from Bekaki and he wrote about a hundred dramas
 lekin rangamanch main unhen lokapriy banane kaa kaam kiya unki kahaniyon ne
 The dramaticness in his stories has also made him popular in the theater world
 tabhi to manto asmita theatre group kii training kaa hissaa hai
 "manto's stories highlight the sting of communalism and gender issues," explains Arvind Gaur, the group's head
 aise sawaal jo aaj bhi kaayam hai
 Just a few months ago, we did a drama called Manto Ki Laden
 manto kii kahaniyon par aadhaarit partishan or mantonama ke to lagbhag 50 sho ho chuke hai or ham unhen jaldi hi ripet karne ja rahe hai
 "manto's popularity is also found in the National School of Drama (NSD)
 enesdy ke tisare varsh ke chaatro ne 8-11 sitambar ko dilli main manto kii kahaniyon kaa manchan neced waices ke naam se kiya or jitne log naatak dekhne ke liye andar the, utane hi andar jagah na mil paane kii vajah se niraash laute
 The number of youth in them was considerable
 isaki diarector neelam maansingh choudhary kahati hai, ''saadat hasan manto kaa kathalok bhadralok nahin he
 They constantly challenge the deception and hypocrisy of their society
 
 
 unki kahaniyaan dharmik purvagrahon or rashtriya ullasonmad se mukt hai
 “this is the reason why their stories are so liked
 theatre diarector saleem aarif is saal apane hit naatak manto mantra ko phir se manchit karne ja rahe hai
 He says that the way Premchand showed the village in his stories, Manto showed the lives and characters of cities which were untouched in literature
 patakatha lekhak atul tiwari manto kii takat kam shabdon main badi baat kehane ko maanate hai
 He says, "they tell a whole story in forty volumes
" jisaki misaal ''ulaahna" he
 Which is like this: "look man, you also took the price of black market and gave such petrol petrol that not even a shop was burnt
 " ab aap khud hi andaja lagaaie
 "the important signatures of publishers' overflowing Urdu literature Manto ka Sani is not in both Hindi and Urdu languages
 unki tuuti sahitya jagat main pichley chah dashak se barkaraar he
 Vani Prakashan of Delhi is getting his collection translated into English
 vaani prakaashan kii aditi maheshwari manto kii euaspy ke bare main kahati hai, ''yuva pathakon main manto kaa acha-khaasaa craij he
 When i travel in the metro, i have often seen Manto books with many youths
 " vaani ne manto kii kahaniyon kii puri siries chhaapi he
 Whenever Manto special issue of a magazine came, its popularity also did not decrease
 udbhaavna patrika ke sampadak ajay kumaar bataate hai ki unhone janvari 2016 main manto visheshank nikaala tha, jisaki shuru main 2,200 pratiyaan prakashit kii gai thim
 But after all copies were sold, 800 copies were published on demand
 udhar, harper hindi se prakashit ravishankar bal kii kitaab dozakhanamah jab manto hue gaalib se rou-ba-rou bestceller main shaamil he
 The book, based on the fictional conversation between Manto and Ghalib, has sold nearly 5,000 copies
 online duniya main bhi manto kaa dakhal teji se bad rahaa he
 His literature is present on various websites of hindi-urdu literature
 urdu sahitya ke online thikaane rekhta par top teen lekhakon main manto hameshaa apni jagah banaae rakhte hai
 Audio-videos associated with Manto are also available on the website, and preparations are on to expand this collection further
 radio par afsaneradio ke liye likhane vaale manto jab khud radio par aae to teen maheene kii planning ke saath shuru kiye gaye radio program ko das maheene tak chalaaya gaya
 It ended last month
 radio mirchi par aaraje syma ne ek puraani kahani kaarykram main manto kii lagbhag 40 kahaniyaan pesh kin
 When asked where he got the idea from, Sayama says, "even today, there are the same challenges as in Manto's time
" unhone kadave sach ko pesh kiya
 People described him as writing dirty books while he showed a mirror to the society
 " yah manto kii lokapriyata hi thi ki om puri or navazuddin siddiki sareekhe kalakaaron ne unki kahaniyon ko is sho main padhaa
 Anyway, these lines of Manto bring the current atmosphere and the atmosphere of six decades ago to each other: "don't say that one lakh Hindus were killed and one lakh Muslims were slaughtered
" ye kaho ki do lakh inasaanon ko katl kar diya gaya
 Slaughtering two lakh people is not a big tragedy
 sabase badi traasadee yah he ki jinhen katl kiya gaya, unhen bevajaah maaraa gaya
 After killing one lakh Hindus, Muslims must have thought that Hinduism died
 isi tarah ek lakh musalamaanon ko katl karke hindu khushi manaate honge ki islam khatm ho gaya, lekin hakeekat aapke saamne he
 Only fools can think that religion can be destroyed by bayonets
 "manto kii deewangi ke bare main syma bataati hai, ''maine college main kisi or se manto kii kitaab lekar padhi thi
 i read "kali Shalwar" and at first i did not understand
 par dhire-dhire isaki paraten khulne lageen
 Manto is a name where nothing hides
 " syma kii taiyaari jald hi iskaa doosraa sijan laane kii he
 Sayma says, "manto will come back
" 60 saal main samaaj nahin badla or jab tak samaaj nahin badalegaa manto ko to aana hi padegaa
 "there are no two opinions
 
 
 ek baar phir se bihar main student politics garmane lagi he
 Magadh University's student union election after Patna is the latest part of this episode
 ab tak ke chunaav nateezon se lagata he ki rajya kii student politics satta ke rajnatik gathjod se alag itihaas gande kii ore bad rahi he
 Nearly 28 years later, the election results of the Students Union of Patna and Magadh University are showing some similar signs, where BJP and JDU student organizations fought separate elections
 yahi vajah he ki inke nattejey alag-alag rangon main dekhne ko mili hai

 The university has 44 colleges, but ABVP members have won 61 out of 137 posts of college representatives
 parishad kii rashtriya kaaryakarini ke sadsy sujay kumaar kehete hai, ''chunaav ko prabhavit karne ke liye kai pratyaashiyon ko laalach bhi diya gaya
 But such people are disappointed
 abivipi ko chaatr hiton ke liye sangharshrat rahane se yah safalataa mili he
 Ramanandan Kumar of ABVP won the post of president while Amit Kumar won the post of vice president, Deepak Kumar secretary, Rahul Kumar joint secretary and Amit Kumar treasurer
 in paanchon padon par hi chaatr jediu or eiesef ke ummidavaar duusare sthaan par rahe
