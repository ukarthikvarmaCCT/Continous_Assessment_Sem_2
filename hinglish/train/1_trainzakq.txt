 a post shared by Sidharth Malhotra (@ s1dofficial) on Dec 7, 2017 at 4:10 am PST bollywood ke sabase zyada charchit kapaldipika padukonaur ranvir singh kii shaadi se pardaa uth gaya he
 Both the stars have announced their wedding date by sharing a special card on social media
 deepika or ranvir kii shaadi kaa samaaroh 14 november or 15 november ko hogi
 As soon as this news comes in front, this couple, famous among fans, has started receiving congratulations
 sabase pehle deepika ko shaadi kii badhisonam kapooraurakaran joharne di
 Sonam Kapoor wrote, a lot of love
 karan johar nernavir sinhako badhai dete hue likhaa, "lots and pots of love xxrep 6 ! Badhai Ho xxrep 6 ! "
 Tiger Shroff created a love filled emoji congratulating the two stars and Likha, "congratulation xxrep 4 s ," went viral as soon as Deepika Ranveer's wedding card surfaced
 is card ko 1 ghante main takreeban 5 lakh logon ne like kiya he
 The most important thing about the card is that it has been released in both Hindi and English languages
 shaadi kii khabar aate hi puraa bollywood donon stars ko dil se badhaiyaan de rahaa he
 Let me tell you that it was expected that both stars can take seven rounds in Italy in a private ceremony
 is dream wedding main sirf 30 mehmaan bulaae jaaenge
 According to reports, guests will not be allowed to carry phones at this wedding
 isaki vajah he ki ye shaadi se judi sabhi rasmon ko personal rakhana
 Indian cricket team's acting director Ravi Shastri, former cricketer Sunil Gavaskar and Team India's ODI captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni may suffer losses in the cleanliness drive of BCCI president Shashank Manohar
 darasal 9 november se lagu ho rahe hiton ke takaraav sambandhi niyamon main kam se kam teen aise points hai jo ki in teenon kaa nuksaan karaayenge
 According to these rules, no paid commentator can remain on any post in BCCI (including IPL)
 aapako bataa den ki ravi shastri ped comentator hone ke saath hi ipel kii gavarning council ke member bhi hai
 After these rules come into force from 9 November, they have to choose one of the governing council and commentary which is going to be very difficult for them
 ped comentator kii extra inakam main katautee!bisisiai ke ped comentator print yaa electronic media se kisi tarah kaa judaav nahin rakh sakate
 Significantly, Sunil Gavaskar often goes to TV shows and along with that he keeps writing for various newspapers
 bisisiai se comentry ke liye har saal karodon rupye paane vaale gavaskar ko ab apni atirikt kamai ko chhodana pad saktaa he
 According to the new rules, no cricketer can keep a link with any other Indian cricketer from the company managing the other player
 ab ye to sabko pataa he ki dhoni, rabindra jadeja, bhuneshwar kumaar, pragyan ojha, mohit sharma, karn sharma, or ke el rahul in sabhi ko reeti sports hi manage karti he
 Along with this, former BCCI President n Srinivasan may also suffer from these rules as it is clear that there should not be any conflict of interest of any family member of any person holding the post of profit in BCCI

 Input: from language haal main bihar vidhansabha kii 10 siton par hue upachunaav ke nateezon ko argedy pramukh lalu prasad yadav or jedy (you) netaa nitish kumaar ke mail kii kamyaabi kaha ja saktaa he
 Lalu and Nitish had to face defeat in the Lok Sabha elections
 upachunaav main chah siton par kabja karne se inaki sulah ab lalu-nitish-congress ke durjey gathbandhan main badal gai he
 At the same time, in the by-election, the BJP had to satisfy only four seats, which is two less than the seats it won in 2010
 bhagava kheme ke liye yah bada nuksaan he kyonki loksabhaa ke pradarshan ko dekhte hue bijepi ko aath siten jeetni chahie thi
 It is clear that the strength of BJP in Bihar has been halved due to the alliance with nitish-lalu and the Congress
 lekin upachunaav ke nateezon ko lalu-nitish kii jeet se zyada bijepi kii haar ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 The BJP clearly failed to save the votes it got in the Lok Sabha elections
 vah loksabhaa chunaav main votaron kaa bharosa jeet gai thi or uske gathbandhan ko rajya kii 40 main se 31 loksabhaa siton par jeet mili thi
 But she failed to maintain the same trust
 uski naakaami kii sabase badi abhivyakti upachunaavon ke matdaan pratishat main ai giravat he
 In the by-elections held on August 21, 46 percent of the voters voted, which was 52 percent of the voting of these 10 constituencies in the Lok Sabha elections
 05 se 6
 05 percent less
 matdaan pratishat main 6
 This reduction of 05 percent is 7 in bjp's vote percentage
 6 pratishat kii kami kii vajah bani
 The decline in the voting percentage is the main reason for bjp's defeat because the party has won four seats out of the seven seats where the voting percentage is 45 percent or more, whereas in the three seats where the turnout was less than 45 percent, it won Defeated
 bijepi ke liye ye aankade khatre kii ghanti hai kyonki inase yah sanket miltaa he ki loksabhaa chunaav main vot dene vaale aise adhikansh voter jo upachunaav main vot dene nahin nikle, bijepi samarthak the
 The saffron camp failed to evict its supporters from their homes
 iskaa matlab sirf pradesh bijepi netritv kaa kamjor hona hi nahin he, ek varisht bijepi netaa ne sweekaar kiya, “bijepi samarthakon kaa vot dene nahin nikalnaa narendra modi ke aakarshan main giravat kaa sanket bhi ho saktaa he
 After all, the Modi government has so far failed to curb inflation or fulfill any of the major promises
 ”lagata he, bijepi ne lalu kii bahuprachaarit or aakraamak mandal raajnneeti kii barabari karne kii koshish karke bhi galati kii
 The BJP failed to stand apart from the lalu-nitish coalition and lost its original votes of the upper castes in the exercise of taking the candidates into consideration
 lalu-nitish gathbandhan ne savarna jatiyon ke chaar ummidavaar maidan main utaare the or ve sabhi jeet gaye
 This reinforced the opinion that even upper caste voters, traditionally considered to be BJP supporters, can change the face
 ek bijepi vidhayak ne kaha, “aapane kaise soch liya ki yadav ek baar phir lalu ko chhodkar bijepi se haath mila lenge? aakhir modi ke mantrimandal main bihar kaa ek bhi yadav mantri nahin he
 Not only this, Rajput voters of Chhapra supported the RJD candidate due to bjp's declared backward-leaning proclivity
 ”upachunaav ke nattejey bihar ke mizaaj main aae bade badlaav ko bhi dikhaate hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the bjp-led NDA was ahead in 171 assembly seats
 argedy 29 siton par aage thi jabaki jedy (you) ummidavaar sirf 17 vidhansabha kshetron main badhat bana paae the
 The first impact of the by-election will be seen in neighboring Jharkhand where assembly elections are due this year
 bihar ke pratikul parinaamon ke chalate jharkhand main bijepi netritv ko apane us faisle par punarvichaar karnaa pad saktaa he jisamen usne loksabhaa pradarshan ko dohraane kii ummid main gathbandhan prastaavon ko nakaar diya tha
 The biggest setback for the BJP was its defeat in the Bhagalpur seat, considered a party stronghold
 vaise bhagalpur loksabhaa kshetra se bijepi pratyaashee shahanvaj hossain chunaav haar gaye the par bhagalpur vidhansabha kshetra se unhone 32,375 voton kii badhat darj kii thi
 No wonder Bhagalpur had the lowest turnout of 37 percent this time
 chhapra main bhi bijepi kii haar kam niraashajanak nahin he kyonki loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ke rajeev pratap rudi ne is vidhansabha kshetra se argedy kii rabari devi par 38,256 voton kii badhat darj kii thi
 In the by-election, Rajput voters joined hands with their traditional rival Yadavs to win Prabhunath Singh's son and RJD candidate Ranbir Kumar Singh

 Apparently, both Shahnawaz and Rudy could not get their candidates to vote in the by-elections
 bijepi ke sahyogi ram vilaas paswan ko hajipur vidhansabha seat se, jahaan ve 56,804 voton se aage rahe the, bijepi pratyaashee kii jeet kaa santosh ho saktaa he
 But from Parbat, he faced the uncomfortable situation of losing his party candidate by a margin of 56,000 votes
 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne paswan kii lok janashakti party or upendra kushvaha kii rashtriya lok samta party se safal gathjod kiya tha
 But in the by-election, he did not give just one seat to Paswan and a single seat to Kushwaha, which encouraged his traditional supporters
 apni sharton par upachunaav ladgaye ke bijepi ke aagrah se lalu-nitish ko uske saamaajik vistaar ko rokane main madad mili
 The Lok Sabha results had shown how urban and baniya-brahmin's party BJP had become a party with broad social base
 lekin upachunaav main lalu-nitish gathbandhan yadav, muslim or ati pichhadi jatiyon ke vot batorne main safal rahaa
 However, it is too early to say that the Grand Alliance has become the key to success against the political equation of Modi and BJP
 upachunaavon ke nattejey argedy or jedy (you) ke liye ahm hai kyonki unke gathbandhan par ise janamat sangrah ke taur par pesh kiya gaya tha
 The public accepted it as well
 nitish kii nappi-tuli pratikriya thi, “sadbhaav kii jeet hui he or unmaad failaane waalon kii haar
 See what happens next
 ” lalu or nitish donon ek-duusare ko apane mul vot dilaane main kaamyaab hue
 On the other hand, the BJP promoted the lalu-nitish alliance as the role of Jungle Raj, but the voters did not pay attention to it
 lalu ne is bare main twit bhi kiya, “hamaari sarkaar puunjipati nahin, garib chalaate hai, isliye hamaara garib raaj unako jangal raaj lagata he
 The JD (U) has 119 mlas against rjd's 24 in the Bihar Legislative Assembly
 safalataa dar ke hisaab se upachunaav main argedy ne apni ladi chaar siton main se teen siten jeetin jabaki jedy (you) ne chaar main se do
 In such a situation, Lalu can claim leadership in the next assembly elections
 jediu-argedy-congress gathbandhan kii jeet se kshetreey partiyon ke saath congress kii ummiden bhi jaagi hai
 These parties are facing an existential crisis after being defeated by Modi three months ago
 philhal bijepi khud ko is tathy se santvanaa de sakati he ki rajya ke itihaas main vidhansabha upachunaav ke nattejey shaayad hi kabhi mukhya chunaav main dohraye gaye hon
 BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi also said, “the results are worse than our expectations
 hamen 10 main se kam se kam 6 siten jeetne kii ummid thi
 But Nitish Kumar's happiness is needless
 agle saal vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi majboot banakar ubharegi
 "yet, the BJP will have to work afresh on its strategy for the October 2015 assembly elections
 bihar hi nahin karnataka or madhya pradesh ke upachunaav ke nateezon ne bhi bijepi ko jhatka diya he
 In Karnataka, where it got only one of the three seats and the remaining two seats went to the Congress, it lost one of the three seats in Madhya Pradesh
 bijepi ko upachunaav ke nateezon par chintan karnaa hoga or yah bhi samajhnaa hoga ki modi lahar ab mand pad rahi he

 court ne sibiai ko aadesh diya he ki wo unki sampatti kii puri jaanch kare or pataa lagaae kii unki companiyon main paisa kahaan se aayaa
 The court said that these investigations should be done under the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Money Laundering Act

 Asaduddin Owaisi, president of All India majlis-e-ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM), on Friday discussed the no-confidence motion in the Lok Sabha on the Modi government and asked if it wanted to make India Dalit and Muslim free
 haalanki modi sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhane ke liye unhone mashhoor shaayar habib jaalib kii jis najm kaa sahaara liya, use padhate hue vah ladkadhaate rahe
 Due to short time, some words of Najm were also moved here and there in haste
 loksabhaa medhvishwaas prastaavpar charchaa karte hue ovaisi ne modi sarkaar se saat sawaal kiye
 He said, 124 of our soldiers have been killed in Kashmir, but what is your Kashmir policy? Owaisi said that this government is making big claims of love for Dalits, but the judge who gave a decision in the Supreme Court against SC / ST Act, was appointed as the judge of NGT
 sarkaar main itani himmat nahin he ki vah essi / asti act par adhyadesh laae
 In this sequence, Owaisi said, the fixed deposit is six percent, inflation is six percent, what is your policy
 unhone kaha, 'meraa sarkaar se sawaal he aap congress mukt bharat chaahate hai yaa dalit-muslim mukt bharat chaahate hai
 The policy of the government created an atmosphere of fear in the country
 'modi sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue ovaisi mashhoor shaayar habib jaalib kii najee ko galat tareeke se pard gaye
 He said while reading Najm, 'you say that the flowers of the branches started blooming
 tum kaho shaakhon par phool phalne lage
 , You say that the chalk started sewing, i do not believe this lie as the robbery of Zehn
 tumne lutaa he sadiyon-sadiyon hamaara sakuun,'ab na ham par chalegaa tumhaara fusuncharagar dardamandon ke banate ho kyountum nahin charagar koi maane magar, nahin manemain nahin maanata main nahin jaanatadansal sadan main kam samay hone kii vajah se unke shabd ladkadaa gaye or habib jaalib kii najm ke shabdon ko idhar-udhar kar diya

 Prabhu is pleased with this fast and gives infinite merit to the seeker
 jyeshtha maas kii krishna paksh kii ekadshi ko vrath rakhkar bhagwaan vishnu kii puja karne kaa vidhaan he
 This Ekadashi is known as Apara Ekadashi
 aparaa ekadshi kaa ek arth yah ki is ekadshi kaa punya apaar he
 By observing this Ekadashi fast, people get rid of sins and get rid of Bhavsagar
 puraanon main ekadshi ke vrath ke bare main kaha gaya he ki vyakti ko dashami ke din shaam main suryaast ke baad bhojan nahin karnaa chahie
 One should sleep while meditating on God
 ekadshi ke din subah uthakar, snaan karke bhagwaan vishnu kii puja kerani chahie
 In puja, offerings of Tulsidal, Shrikhand sandalwood, Ganga water and fruits should be offered
 vrath rakhane vaale ko puure din paraninda, jhooth, chal-kapat se bachanaa chahie
 Those who do not keep fast for any reason, should not eat rice on the day of Ekadashi
 jo vyakti ekadshi ke din 'vishnusahasranam' kaa paath karata he, us par bhagwaan vishnu kii vishesh krupa hoti he
 The fast story is as follows: There was a godly king named Mahidhwaj
 raja kaa chota bhai vajradhvaj bade bhai se dwesh rakhata tha
 One day he killed the king and buried the dead body under a peep in the forest
 akaal mrityu hone ke kaaran raja kii aatma pret banakar pipal par rahane lagi
 Every person passing through the path was troubled by the soul
 ek din ek rishi is raste se guzar rahe the
 He saw the phantom and came to know the reason for his phantom becoming his ghost
 rishi ne pipal ke ped se raja kii pretatma ko neeche utaara or paralok vidya kaa upadesh diya
 In order to get the king free from the phantom vulva, the sage himself observed Apara Ekadashi fast
 dwadashi ke din vrath puraa hone par vrath kaa punya pret ko de diya
 After attaining the virtue of Ekadashi fast, the king was freed from the phantom and went to heaven

 chhattisgarh ke purv mukhyamantri ajit jogi kii patni renu jogi jald hi congress ko tata by-by kar sakati he
 She is currently a Congress MLA from Kota Assembly seat in Bilaspur
 lagaataar do baar wo is seat se bijepi ummidavaar ko haraakar vidhansabha pahunchi hai
 But for the third time in the Vidhan Sabha elections to be held in the year 2018, she will become the Congress candidate from this seat, it is highly unlikely
 darasal, renu jogi apane pati ajit jogi ke saath har us manch par najar aa rahi hai, jis manch sijit jogicongress or bijepi ko kos rahe hai
 While attacking his opponents from the stage, Jogi has also indicated that Renu Jogi is with him
 bilaspur ke pendra main saje is manch main jogi ke vidhayak putr or bahu samet party ke duusare netaa bhi maujuud the
 The opportunity was for the Jogi Congress's Chhattisgarh Adhikar Yatra
 is kaarykram main renu jogi kii maujuudagi se congress sakate main he
 However, the party is already assuming that Renu Jogi can also leave the Congress on the lines of her husband and MLA son
 lihaaja congress ne is kaarykram ko lekar koi pratikriya jaahir nahin kii he
 State Congress President Bhupesh Baghel has only said that the party will see why Renu Jogi shared this political platform
 duusari orjit jogiiske pehle bhi saarvjaanik taur par kah chuke hai ki renu jogi unki patni hai or unase alag nahin ja saktin
 She has not been able to join his party only due to constitutional reasons for the post of MLA
 isse saaf he ki sirf vidhansabha kii sadsyta barkaraar rakhane ke liye renu jogi congress main bani hui hai
 Assembly elections are due in Chhattisgarh in the year 2018
 lihaaja bijepi or congress ne ek duusare par hamale tej kar die hai
 The main contest is expected to be between the two parties
 lekin unke sameekaran bigaadane ke liye aap party, chhattisgarh swabhimaan party, BSP, sarv adivasee morcha, NCP or jogi congress jaise rajnatik dal bhi apni maujuudagi darj karaane ke liye edi chotii kaa jor laga rahe hai
 For the moment, it has to be seen what attitude the Congress takes in the case of Renu Jogi

 Although no Bollywood star attended the inaugural function of the Delhi Commonwealth Games, how could this colorful ceremony be completed without Bollywood in celebration of Indianness
 samaaroh ke aakhri daur main logon ne ‘great indian jarney’ ko ‘chhiya chhiya’ geet ke saath dekhi
 In this tableau, Bollywood was also represented in the tableau which speaks of Indian lifestyle
 isamen amitabh bachchan ‘diwaar ’ ke geoup main, aamir khan ‘lagaan’ ke get ap main, shahrukh khan ‘om shaati om’ ke geoup main or dakshin ke superstar rajnikant ke bhi katout the 
 Before the ceremony, composer Anandraj Anand and singer Shibani Kashyap performed their famous Bollywood songs
 gujarat main baar-baar patidaar netaaon kaa ultimatum jhel rahi congress ko purv sahyogi ensipi se bhi jhatka laga he
 There is no consensus between the Congress and the Patidars on all the issues ranging from ticket distribution
 ab isi kadi main congress kii purv sahyogi ensipi (rashtravaadi congress party) ne bhi gujarat main alag se chunaav ladane kaa elaan kiya he
 Senior party leader Praful Patel said that there had been talks on alliance with the Congress party for several days but there was no strong response from them
 patel ne kaha ki congress ne gathbandhan ko lekargambhirtha nahin dikhaai, isiilie ab ensipi ne akele chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 He said that NCP will come down with the intention of further strengthening its position in the state
 prafull patel ne kaha ki gujarat main sattavirohi lahar he or agar vipakshi dal ek saath aakar laden to iskaa phayda mil saktaa he
 He said that the Congress party announced its candidates without negotiating, even in areas where NCP workers are working hard
 patel ne kaha ki ensipi kii taiyaari majboot he or ham chunaav main jane ko puri tarah taiyaar hai
 Holding the Congress responsible for alliance, Patel said that now our candidates will also contest against the Congress
 ham apni jimmedaari samaj rahe hai lekin congress ko bhi yah samajhnaa chahie tha
 We have good candidates and perhaps a greater chance of success could be expected if we fought the elections together
 bhartiya tennis ke sabhi top khilaadi ab wimbledon main apni kismat aazamaa rahe hai or ise olympics kii taiyaari ke taur par bhi dekha ja rahaa he
 Meanwhile, Mahesh Bhupathi has given further reaction to the already ongoing controversy by reacting to Sania's very tough threat
 mahesh bhupati ne yah bhi ishaara kiya ki vah sania ke saath olympix main mixd dubles khel sakate hai
 Sania got the wild card and perhaps the biggest controversy ever in Indian tennis
 sania ke bayaan se pehle se hi baikfoot par chal rahi tennis sangh kii pareshaani or badhati nazar aa rahi he
 Especially when Mahesh Bhupathi has not only stood with Sania in this issue, but his statement can now provoke the camp of Leander Paes
 bhupati kehete hai tennis main chizein or karaab ho sakati thim
 They have put us in a difficult situation
 mujhe sania ke saath sahanubhuti he
 Sania was not asked while making the team
 main ab bhi sania ke saath olympix main khilne ko taiyaar hum
 Bhupathi may be responding to the promise made to Sania but, it does not seem to solve the issue
 zaahir he ab tak khamosh dikh rahe pes kii fitarat chup hokar sunate rahane vaale khilaadi kii nahin he
 In such a situation, if Paes opens his mouth, then the players will be satisfied as much as they can
 hota nahin dikhataa
 Some officials of the Tennis Association can be seen at the Wimbledon stands in London these days, but they will be more upset if they allow the issue to once again come in the media and public before the Olympics
 zaahir taur par tennis kii jang main liender filhal khilaadiyon ke bich akele dikh rahe hai
 So the pair of Bhupathi and Bopanna are very happy
 bopanna pehali baar olympics main khilne ko lekar behad utsahit hai
 He is confident that the pair can do wonders in the Olympics
 dubles main world number 13 rohan bopanna kehete hai ham vaaki khush hai
 We are excited that we are participating in the London Olympics together
 hamane iske liye landan 2012 ke liye 6 maheene kadi mehnat kii he
 The comments is baar tennis main aath khilaadi olympics main ja rahe hai jo bharat kii ab tak kii sabase badi tennis team he
 However, India has only won one medal from tennis at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996
 ittifaakan wo kaansya padak liender pes ne singles muqaabalon main jeeta tha
 After that, the tennis team in Sydney Athens and Beijing also missed the medal several times
 is baar ummid to he lekin bhartiya khel premiyon kii badi fikr yah he ki yah jhagada or badha to tennis se olympics main padak kii ummid or feeki pad jaaegi
 Mahesh Bhupathi also hinted that he could play mixed doubles in the Olympics with Sania
 sania ko wild card milte hi bhartiya tennis ke ab tak ke shaayad sabase bada vivaad or garma gaya
 Sania's statement seems to further aggravate the already troubled tennis association running on the backfoot
 khaas kar tab jab mahesh bhupati is masale main naa sirf sania ke saath khadey ho gaye hai balki unka bayaan ab liender pes ke camp ko bhadkaa saktaa hai
 Bhupathi says things could have been worse in tennis
 unhone hamen mushkil halaat main daal diya he
 i sympathize with Sania
 team banaate vakt sania se nahin poocha gaya
 i am still ready to play in the Olympics with Sania
 bhupati shaayad sania ko kiye gaye vaade kaa jawaab de rahe hai lekin, isse masalaa sulajhata nahin dikh rahaa he
 It is obvious that the character of Paes, who is looking silent till now, is not the one who keeps listening silently
 aise main agar pes ne munh kholaa to khilaadiyon kaa ahm chaahe jitna santusht ho jaae khel kaa bhala Does not seem to happen
 tennis sangh ke kuch adhikari in dinon landan main wimbledon ke stands main dekhe ja sakate hai lekin, unhone is masale ko ab olympix se pehle ek baar phir media or public main aane diya to unki or faziihat hi hogi
 Apparently, in the war of tennis, Leander is currently seen alone among the players
 to bhupati or bopanna kii jodi behad khush he
 Bopanna is excited about playing in the Olympics for the first time
 unhen bharosa he ki jodi olympics main kamaal kar sakati he
 World number 13 in doubles Rohan Bopanna says we are really happy
 ham utsahit hai ki ham ek saath landan olympix main hissaa le rahe hai
 We worked 6 months hard for London 2012 for this
 tippaniyan This time, eight players in tennis are going to the Olympics, which is the largest tennis team in India so far
 lekin, bharat ko tennis se ab tak 1996 main atlanta olympix main sirf ek padak hasil hua he
 The bronze medal was won by Leander Paes in singles matches
 uske baad sidney athens or beijing main tennis team kai baar padak ke paas pahunch kar bhi chook gai
 This time there is hope, but the big concern of Indian sports lovers is that if this quarrel increases, tennis will lose hope and medal in the Olympics

 It is surprising that the sedition law is still misused in India
 2014 main meerut main pakistani cricket team kaa samarthan karne ke liye 68 kashmiri chaatro par yah kanoon thopa gaya
 In 2019, this law was imposed on 12 students of Aligarh Muslim University for attacking opponents
 bharat main is kanoon kaa dhadlle se durupyog kiya gaya he, bhale hi satta main koi bhi party rahi ho
 However, sedition charges in court are very short-lived
 2014 se lekar 2016 ke bich 179 logon ko rajdroh ke kanoon ke tahat aaropee banaaya gaya, lekin maatr do maamalon main aarope tay ho sakaa
 Whereas, in the democratic politics of all the countries, either this law has been abolished or has become irrelevant
 lekin hamaare desh main ye tathy zyada myne nahin rakhte
 On the contrary, we see a greater possibility of this law being made more stringent
 bhartiya dand samhita (IPC) kii dhara 124A ke tahat rajdroh kaa dayera kaaphi vyapak he
 It states that "any person who, through written or spoken words, by signs, by visual or by any other means, spreads hatred against the government, contempts or attempts to do so, or incites dissent against the government
" 
 
 " yah sangyeya aparaadh he, jisamen arest warrant kii jarurat nahin he
 It is a non-bailable and non-negotiable (in which case there is no compromise between the two parties) offense
 iske tahat teen saal se lekar aaajeevan jail kii sajaa ho sakati he, saath main jurmaana bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he

 "mahatma Gandhi's beloved Nehru was also a victim of this during British rule
 iske bare main ek baar gandhi ne kaha tha ki "kisi ko bhi apana asantosh vyakt karne kii aazaadee honi chahie, bhale hi usase hinsa ko uksaava miltaa ho

 Britain removed the sedition law
 The legacy of the Indian Constitution has come from Britain

 jabaki kaarysthal par koi bhi manager bephikr logon ko jimmedaari se dur hi rakhana pasand karata he
 That is, the next time your boss is saying something to you, not only listen to them but also make them feel responsible
 2) badha chadhaakar pesh karnajab kabhi kaarysthal par kisi se baat karen, phir chaahe vah aapkaa bos hi kyon na ho
 Do not exaggerate things or things for small success
 yah aapaki chhavi ko kharaab karata he or saamne vaala yahi samajhataa he ki aap bas baat karnaa jaanate hai
 Never spread your arms or talk with your palm in the order of conversation
 3) baar baar ghadi dekhnakisi se baat karte samay uski ankhon main dekhakar baat karen
 It shows that you have confidence in you
 nazren churaana yaa baar-baar ghadi kii ore dekhnaa galat he
 It tells that you want to end the conversation sooner rather than listen to what is in front of you
 4) khud ko dusron se alag karnaap bahut acha kaam karte hai, lekin agar aap logon kii baatcheet main shaamil nahin hote to yah galat he
 Whenever the office people are talking among themselves, instead of keeping themselves away from them, they should join their group
 yah bataata he ki aap kaam ke saath logon se behatar sambandh main bhi dilchaspee rakhte hai
 5) Cross leg or cross arms can be seen many times that people like to sit in cross leg in order of conversation
 yaa baahon ko modakar baat karte hai
 Body language experts believe this should not be done
 khaskar tab jab aap apane bos se baat kar rahe hai
 Because it means that you don't want to talk openly or are hiding something
 6) baatcheet ke kram main haavbhaavap jo bol rahe hai, vah aapke chehre par bhi dikhnaa chahie
 For example, if you are sad, then it should be seen on the face
 pareshaan hai to dikhnaa chahie
 Otherwise, the person in front will not believe you
 7) had se zyada sir hilanasamne vaale kii baat se sahamat hone par ham sir hilaakar uskaa samarthan karte hai, lekin bevajaah har baat par yaa had se adhik sir hilaane se bachein
 8) Curing hair repeatedly, never fix your hair or clothes again and again in order of conversation
 isse yah lagata he ki aap bas khud kaa dhyaan rakhte hai or aapakon dusron kii baton yaa vichaaron main koi ruchi nahin he
 9) To meet the eye Like before it has been said that in order of conversation, talk with the eye
 10) aankh milaayein, ghure nahinankh milakar baat karne kaa arth saamne waalon kii ankhon main ankhe daalkar ghoorna nahin hota
 Usually, talk for 7-10 seconds at a time in order of conversation
 phir palak jhapakaaen
 11) Eyes go round and round, people rotate their eyes round and round in order of conversation
 aisa karne se bachein
 If this is your habit then try to change it
 12) khush rahen, chehre par taazgi banaakar rakhenkaam karte hai to kaam se khush rahanaa bhi jaruri he
 It is not a good thing to keep a face all the time or look sad
 13) haath milaate vaktakabhi bhi halke haath yaa beficri ke andaaj main haath na milaayein
 It makes you feel like you are lacking in confidence
 jab haath milaayein, puri sphurti or taazgi ke saath
 14) Grasping the fist in the order of conversation also indicates wrong
 isse bhi cross leg yaa cross arm kii tarah yahi sanket jaataa he ki aap khulkar baat nahin karnaa chaahate
 15) Do not go too close and keep the required distance in order of conversation
 bahut adhik nikat jaakar baatcheet na karen

 dilli-ensiaar main vaayu pradooshan kii samasya kaa tatkaal samaadhaan hota nahin dikh rahaa he
 The politics has also intensified on the poisonous air of Delhi
 centre sarkaar ne 80 fisadi pradooshan ke liye dilli ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 The NGT has issued a decree on spraying water with a helicopter
 pradooshan par aathven din jaagi dilli sarkaar ne ek hafte ke liye kisi bhi tarah ke nirmaan or dhaahne kii gatividhi par roak laga di he
 Apart from this, the work of canceling the registration of 15 year old diesel vehicles has also been started
 shaadi main aatishbaajee bhi bain kar di gai he
 But when Delhiis get rid of this poisonous air, it is not easy to say
 smog kii jad main aae lahore-karachidilli-ensiaar main hafte bhar se chaaya smog padosi mulk tak pahunch gaya he
 All are surprised by the 'smog bomb' in Lahore and Karachi in Pakistan adjoining Punjab
 beete teen-chaar dinon se lahore shahar ke aasmaan main dhundh kii tarah chai he
 People have complained of itching in eyes and difficulty in breathing
 pakistan kii shikaayat he ki bharat ke punjab main kisaan apane kheton main fasalein katane ke baad bachaa-khuchaa bhusa kheton main jala dete hai
 Because of this, smog has caused havoc in many industrial cities of the country including Pakistan's Punjab province and Karachi
 punjab ke mukhyamantri shahabaaz sharif ne smog ko gambhirtha se lete hue mausam ke halaat par najar rakhane ke liye ek cameti kaa gathan bhi kiya he
 The Punjab government is also considering closing schools in view of health problems and road accidents due to smog
 landan jaisi haalat na ho jaae dilli kidilli or ensiaar main chai dhundh or vaayu pradooshan ne saare record tod die hai
 The air has become very poisonous
 agar halaat jald sudhare to landan jaise halaat ban sakate hai
 Delhi's air quality has reached a low level
 hawa main maujuud kai kism ke chote kan vaise hi kharaab hai, jaise 1952 main landan main hue the
 From 5 December to 9 December 1952, there was a situation of tremendous air pollution in London
 smog kii vajah se halaat itane bighad gaye ki kareeb 4 hajaar log isaki chapet main aakar maare gaye the
 It is said that 10 to 12 thousand people were affected during that incident
 china kii rajdhani beijing main bhi kuch varshon se aise halaat paidaa ho rahe hai
 Every year smog conditions are becoming prevalent in the winter
 haalat yah he ki beijing kii ginati china ke sabase pradooshit shaharon main top par hone lagi he
 However, the Chinese government has taken several steps to avoid pollution
 dilli kaise pahunchaa punjab kaa dhuna?dilli-ensiaar main smog kii haalat bani to iske liye punjab-haryana or aasapaas ke rajyon ke kisaanon par dosha madha gaya
 It is being said that farmers are burning the remaining piles (starch) after harvesting in the fields, due to which the air has been polluted
 nasa ne bhi haal main kuch tasviren jari hai jisamen punjab kii kheton main lagi aag ko dikhaaya gaya he
 But the thing to note here is that from October 16, the wind is moving towards Pakistan and Rajasthan
 aise main punjab ke kheton main jalane vaali paraali se dilli main pradooshan kaise bad saktaa he
 Fire in the fields of neighboring states is not alone responsible for the deteriorated air of delhi-ncr
 dilli-ensiaar main sadakon par daudti dijal kii gaadiyaan, factriyon se nikalne vaala dhuna or diwali ke maukey par hui jamkar aatishbaajee kaa bhi vaayu pradooshan main bahut bada haath he
 These 5 methods will reduce pollution due to the health problems caused by pollution, schools in delhi-ncr have been closed
 vaise is pradooshan ko achaanak se to kam nahin kiya ja saktaa he lekin kuch tareekon se ise kam jarur kiya ja saktaa he
 1
 nakli barishakloud seading ek aisi prakriya he jisamen ek rocket kii sahaayta se aasmaan main kuch chemical chode jate hai
 These chemicals react in the sky and it rains
 2
 Smog removal machine a designer from Netherlands has designed the biggest machine to reduce pollution
 yah mashin 1 ghante main 3 xxrep 4 0 meter cubic aria ko smog free kar detii he
 3
 vaikum clining se bhagaao dhulavacum clinar kaa istemaal karke bhi aap kaaphi had tak pradooshan ko kam karne main madad kar sakate hai
 In December last year, a person went on the road in China with a vacuum cleaner and after 100 days of dust and mud he had collected, a brick was made later
 4
 If water is poured on the spraying dust, it easily settles on the ground and the air also cools
 isiilie agar rojaanaa ghar ke aasapaas iskaa chhidkaav kiya jaae to kaaphi had tak smog ko kam karne main madad mil sakati he
 5
 dhanke hue park main taaji hawalandan ke architekchar or ek dizin form ne aise park kaa dizin taiyaar kiya he jo pradooshan free honge
 According to their website, these parks will be completely covered and the Botanical Garden built in them will get fresh air to those who come here
 bambe hoicourt main vaikency nikali he

 Recently, Twitter has issued notifications to some users that their Twitter account may be hacked and state sponsored actors will be responsible for this
 un yugers main se zyaadaatar yugers security export, patrkaar or activist hai
 That is, Twitter has accepted that a particular user's account can be targeted to collect information from the government
 vahiin google or fasebukne bhi state sponcerd atake hone par logon ko notification dene kii baat kahi he
 According to them, if they feel that a particular user's account is being targeted by the government, then its information will be immediately given to the users

 Just giving information will not solve the issue of users, because even if the users end their data from the account, a copy of it is saved on the company's server, which is very easy for the government hackers to target

 But because of its limited presence in the virtual world, the Gujarat Congress lagged behind it

 Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said, "we will form our cyber army to respond to bjp's attacks on social media
" 2014 ke aam chunaavon kii daud main aisa jaruri ho gaya he
 We have received instructions from the central leadership of the party to do this and we are trained for this too
 unhone kaha, iskaa uddeshy he ki gaanv ke str par or shaharon ke har ilaake main paanch se chah sakriy log hon
 They will form an entire taluka team and city team
 inase milakar ek kshetreey team banegi or antat: ye sabhi rajya kii sibar sena kaa hissaa honge
 "we had organized a training workshop in the city for 500 Cyber army workers on Sunday," Doshi said
 ham sibar sena ko prashikshit karne ke liye kshetreey str, jila str or taluka str par aisi kaaryshaalaaon kaa aayojan karte rahenge
 The spokesperson further said, "our objective of training the cyber army is to propagate the achievements of the UPA government at the Center on social media, expose the lies spread by the BJP in this virtual world and expose the ground realities and problems of the people
" is
 unhone kaha ki congress kii sibar sena main party ke kaaryakarta or shubhachintak honge jabaki bijepi kaa soshal media sanchaalan nijee dal karte hai or unhen iske liye paisa diya jaataa he
 He said, positive results are coming in a short time because we have been able to compete with BJP on social media
 soshal media ke jariye ham logon se sidhe jud sake hai
 On the other hand, the BJP is far ahead of the state Congress in catching up on social media and connecting with the youth having a large presence in the virtual world
 bijepi kaa soochna or takneekee prakoshth bhi modi kii sibar sena main yuvaaon ko shaamil karne ke liye kadi mehnat kar rahaa he
 bjp's IT cell head Rajika Kacheria said, "our main objective is to connect people, especially the youth, to Chief Minister Narendra Modi

 loksabhaa main jammu-kashmir punargathan bill ko lekar charchaa jari he
 During this discussion, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav lashed out at the central government and called the decision wrong
 saath hi akhilesh ne aarope lagaaya ki aaj kashmir main bal kaa prayog kiya ja rahaa he or is faisle se kashmir kii janata khush nahin he
 Akhilesh Yadav said that today the atmosphere has become such that my neighbors are not present in the House itself
 grih mantri kah rahe hai ki hamane is prastaav ko vidhansabha se paas karaayaa he
 On which Amit Shah interrupted and said that the President has given the power of the assembly to the Governor using his power
 sapa pramukh ne kaha ki do din pehle jammu-kashmir ke rajyapal kah rahe the ki unhen kuch nahin pataa he, lekin pichley 48 ghante main aapane jo kiya wo puure desh ne dekha he
 You are celebrating, but what about the people of the state for which the decision has been taken? 
 
 jab akhilesh ne sunaaya 'bangan' vaala kissis dauraan akhilesh ne ek kissa bhi sunaaya or kaha ki badshaah ne ek baar daavat main kaha ki bangan kii sabji acchhee he to unke mantriyon ne bhi sabji kii tarif kar di
 And the king's partner Birbal did the same
 lekin agle hi din jab badshaah kii tabiyat kharaab hui to unhone birbal ke saamne bangan kii sabji kii buraai kii
 Akhilesh said that after this Birbal did the same, when the emperor questioned, Birbal said that he does not do brinjal's job, but the king's job
 jo badshaah kahegaa, vahi main kahuunga
 Finally, Akhilesh Yadav said that the governor in Jammu and Kashmir has done the same
 sapa pramukh ne bataaya ki main jis army skool se padhaa hum vahaan ke kai saathi ghati main aatankwaadiyon se ladate hue shahid hue hai, mere saathi major gopinder singh rathod ko bhi hamane khoyaa he
 He said that you people say that if nothing has happened in seventy years, don't you count your 11 years
 iske alaava akhilesh yadav ne sarkaar se pakistan adhikrut kashmir (pok) par bhi jawaab maanga or poocha ki grih mantri is baat kaa bharosa den ki pok hamaara hi hissaa he
 The Home Minister should state that pok is ours
 unhone kaha ki saath hi ye bhi bataaen ki kashmir jaisi khushi nagaland-mizoram-sikkim main kab milegi
 a Delhi court today framed charges against Irom Sharmila Chanu, who has been fasting for 12 years, for allegedly trying to commit suicide during her 'fast unto death' in 2006 to demand the removal of the disputed AFSPA
 metropolitan magistrate akaash jain ne 40 varshiya sharmila ke khilaaf bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 309 (aatmahatya kaa prayaas) ke tahat aarope tay kiye
 Sharmila denied any offense, saying it was her non-violent performance
 adaalat ne is maamle main abhiyojan paksh ke saboot darj karne ke liye 22 may kii taarikh tay kii he
 The case relates to his fast unto death at Jantar Mantar here on 4 October 2006 demanding the removal of the Military Forces Privilege Act (AFSPA)
 adaalat parisar ke baahar pradarshan ke bich, sharmila nyaayadhish ke saamne pesh huin or unhone kaha, ‘main aatmahatya nahin karnaa chaahati hum
 i have only non-violent performance
 maanav kii tarah jivan jeena meri maang he
 'he told the court,' i love life
 main apni jindagi lenaa nahin chaahati lekin main nyaay or shanti chaahati hum
 However, the magistrate told him that he was accused of trying to commit suicide and prima facie a charge appears against him
 yah puche jane par ki kya aap apana aparaadh sweekaar karti hai, sharmila ne kaha ‘nahin’
 Shy will now have to face trial
 nyaayadhish ne kaha ki main aapkaa sammaan karata hum lekin desh kaa kanoon aapako apni jindagi khatm karne kii anumati nahin detaa he
 Even after discussing with her lawyer, Sharmila said that if the government removes AFSPA, only then i will take food
 haalanki adaalat ne kaha ki yah raajnneetik prakriya he
 Here i only focus on this matter

 sharmila ko adalati kaarywahi ke liye kal shaam manipur se yahaan laayaa gaya he
 His lawyer told the court that his client has been performing non-violently like Mahatma Gandhi for the past 12 years

 (input from IANS) (input ieenes se) Indian-origin scientist Manisha Mohan of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has developed a sensor that looks like a sticker, which will prevent incidents such as rape and send alerts to people and their friends and family nearby
 yah sensor kisi bhi kapade par steekar kii tarah lagaaya ja saktaa he
 This sensor is designed in such a way that it forcibly removes the activity of removing clothes from the body and works accordingly

 If the victim is not in a position to fight or for some reason she cannot walk or is a small child, then in such a situation this sensor can send alert to her family and friends

 The Hindu world in its mythological system is somewhat different
 iske vipareet hindutv maujuuda daur main duniya main prabhavi vichaaron ke kaaphi kareeb he
 This is realized by looking at two myths — equality and hurt emotion
 samanta kaa mythkprakruti main vividhta he
 There is also a similarity in the sense that nature does not consider any creature special
 har jivit praani ko apni kshamtaaon or takat ke jariye astitv kii raksha kerani hoti he or apni kamajoriyon se ubarkar khataron se jujhate hue maukey talashne hote hai
 The cultural idea of equality is very different
 yah vah myth he jo abraham se judi manyataon ko aakaar detaa he
 The God of Abrahamic recognition loves all his followers equally
 vah behad irshyaalu he or baaki devon ko bardaasht nahin karata
 There is no high or low in the eyes of God
 uski duniya main kisi bhi matbhed, yani anoothepan ko ujagar karne kii har koshish ko ghamand yaa kumparasti ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 This is the reason why Abrahamic beliefs try to bring uniformity
 ve kisi bhi bhatkaav ko lekar ashishnu hoti hai
 They keep trying to find the same truth
 hindoodharm isse kaaphi alag he
 He values diversity
 yahaan har samudaay ko anoothaa samajha jaataa he
 Each has its own deities, its own beliefs and customs
 jangal main pedo or jaanwaron kii hi tarah samudaayon ke bheetar bhi tanaav hota he kyonki ve sansadhano ke liye hode karte hai
 As a result, an indefinite variety of hierarchies is formed
 aise main, kuch samudaay or natijatan kuch bhagwaan bhi baakiyon se zyada mahatvapurn ban jate hai
 But this does not last forever
 koi na koi to hameshaa centre main rahata he or hameshaa koi na koi haashie par
 But it is a mobile process
 vividhta hi padanukram ko janm detii he lekin jab vah jad ho jaati he to usase asamanta ko sansthagat rup mil jaataa he
 Hence, the reality is that Hinduism is full of diverse communities where thousands of castes fight for power
 har koi saidhantik vaidic chaturvarna vyavastha main apni jagah banane kii koshish karata he
 Here the similarity comes from the principle of the soul , which is the body of a body
 yah deh hi vividh samaaj main sthapit hoti he
 The existing humanitarian theory of the global village stems from the Abrahamic beliefs, along with the principle of human rights
 isamen sirf itnaa hua he ki ishwar kaa sthaan rajya ne le liya he or manyata kii jagah deshbhakti ne le lee he
 Good constitution is a set of rules in which all citizens are equal and their rights are equal and there is talk of providing equal access to resources
 samaan adhikaron kaa yah siddhant vividhta ko nahin pahachaanata
 The current global crisis is due to this
 aakhir apane sabhi nagarikon ko samaan adhikaar dene vaala koi rajya kaise un dharmon ko jagah de, jinka bhagwaan unhen mahilaon ko purushon ke baraabar maanane kii ijaajat nahin detaa yaa jinaki samskruti main samalangikon ko baraabar nahin mana gaya he yaa jo apni mahilaon ko janajati ke baahar vivaah karne kii ijaajat nahin detaa yaa purushon ko apni manyataayen badalane nahin detaa yaa jo jatiyaan anya jatiyon ko achhut maanati hai?''bharat vicharya samanta ke siddhant ke ird-gird buna gaya
 India has been dealing with diversity for a long time, but developed countries are now going to face it when their countries are coming in large numbers of migrants, the economy is slowing down and in keeping with the principles of equal rights and social justice
 Uniform conditions are beginning to appear in the same uniformity
 lihaaja, yah swaabhaavik hi he ki ''bharat vichaar" or abrahami manyataon vaale raashtra-rajyon kaa hindu dharm se virodh kaa rishta hoga, jo apni jati, vividhta or oonch-neech main sahaj bana rahata he
 The world was better in the myth of suffering
 uske baad usamen pidaa judadi shuru hui
 Then came treatment
 abrahami manyataon kaa yahi pramukh myth he
 Human beings are not convicted of disobeying God
 ve to peedit hai jo shaitan ke bahekaave main aa gaye hai
 In such a situation the Prophet is the savior for them who fights Satan and saves humanity
 pidaa kaa myth or uske parinamswaroop uddhaar hi aaj aadhunik vaishvik chintan ko nirdhaarit karata he
 Deportation, and extermination are considered the pangs of Judaism itself
 ali kaa intkaal shiya islam kii pidaa he
 The end of the Khilafat is the plague of Jihadi Islam
 jati daliton kii pidaa he
 Patriarchy is the anguish of feminism
 garibi samyawad or poonjeevaad kii pidaa he
 "century of humiliation" is China's suffering
 ye saare vaishvik vichaar paraajay, anyaay or yaad rakhane ke sankalp kii dharna se aage badhate hai
 They see amnesia as the greatest tragedy
 hindutv kaa to puraa vaasta hi pidaa or aahat bhaavana se he
 She will never "forget" the humiliation of Hindus and the defeat of Hindu civilization which has come from "thousand years of" slavery at the hands of the invaders, first from Muslims, then Christian missionaries and finally British
 bharat ke bauddhik elite yaa aadhunik visheshgy is baat ko fasiwad kahkar khaarij kar denge
 But it is only in reference to all the "sufferings"
 har rajaneta jaanata he ki samskruti kaa kisi ghatana vishesh ke prati jununee, ranneetik or chhedhchhadpurna lagaav taarkikta ko pare rakhkar samaaj main harakat paidaa kar detaa he
 However, these myths of suffering and hurt are completely contrary to Hinduism where Shiva has been named as Smrantaka, the destroyer of memories
 jo janm-mrityu ke chakra se mukti chahta he, jo sad chitt anand kii kaamana karata he, jo shantchitt chahta he, use ''jane do" ke tareeke ko siikhnaa hoga
 Hindutva is monotheistic because it considers the same adorable Bharat Mata
 ve raashtra-rajya kaa pratik hai
 But where we are aware of her children i
e
 the people of this country, we do not know who the husband is
 yah thodi ajeeb baat he ki kyonki hindu dharm kii tamaam deviyon jaise saraswati, lakshmi or durga ke apane patiyon brahma, vishnu, shiv ke saath pragadh or uthal-puthal bhare sambandh rahe hai
 Hindutva posters show Krishna without Radha, Rama without Sita and Shiva without Parvati
 unki bahason main shankaracharya ke brahmacharya kaa gungan kiya jaataa he jinke bare main ve yah daawa karte hai ki unhone ek hajaar saal pehle ladaaku naagaon kaa jattha taiyaar kiya tha taaki videshi hamalaavaron se vinamr saadhuon ko bachaaya ja sake
 This is the claim that Hindutva justifies the existence of "goons" or "marginalized groups"
 haalanki ve us kinvadanti ko nazarandaaj kar denge jab usee shankaracharya ne mandan mishra kii patni ubhaya bharti kii salaah par apni gupt shaktiyon kaa istemaal karke raja amaaru ke sharir main jaakar yon anubhav liya tha
 Dismissing the feminine sense and sexuality of Hindutva resonates only in the Abrahamic myths in which God is clearly male, his messengers are also male and where his son is born to a virgin woman without sex
 abrahami manyataon kii hi tarah hindutv main nishtha mahaj ek sanstha (sangh, vihip, bhaajapa) ke prati anupaalan, anushaasan or samarpan main he or uskaa paramatma ko paane ke liye para jeev ke saath prem, shringaar, maadhurya se koi lenaa-dena nahin he jo ki vastav main hindu bhakthi kii vishistataaen rahi hai
 When Hindutva fights over Valentine's Day, women's power and heritage, and outright reject Hinduism's work culture, it makes sense that these defenders are going to destroy what they want to save
 mithkon kii samasamyik praasangikta par 30 se zyada kitabon ke lekhak*** Another round of confrontation has been set between the government and Team Anna over the Lokpal bill
 sarkaar ne lokapal bill ke nae draft ko manjuuri de di he jisamen sibiai ko lokapal ke daayre se puri tarah baahar rakhaa gaya he lekin kuch ehtiyaaton ke saath pradhanmantri ke pad ko iske adheen laayaa gaya he

 lokapal ko philhal sanvaidhanik darja nahin diya gaya he
 The Lokpal will be a statutory body at present and a separate bill will be brought later to give it constitutional status
 darasal, lokapal ko sanvaidhanik darja dene ke liye kam se kam do−tihaai bahumat chahie jo sarkaar ke liye mushkil lag rahaa he kyonki sibiai ko lokapal ke daayre se baahar rakhane se bijepi or left naakhush he or agar sarkaar ko vipaksh kaa saath chahie to use baatcheet karke bill main sudhaar karnaa hoga isliye sarkaar ne lokapal ko abhi vaidhanik rakhane kaa hi faisla kiya he kyonki ye bill sansad main saadhaaran bahumat se paas ho jayega

 All four members of the same family were killed in a fire in a building in Kohat Enclave area of delhi
 marane waalon main pati-patni or uske do maasoom bachche shaamil hai
 The family lived on the first floor of the building
 dilli police ne bataaya ki fire sarvice ke logon ne sidhiyon ke paas se chaaron kii laash baraamad kii
 According to police, all four died due to suffocation
 police ne mritkon kii pahchaan ghar ke mukhiya rakesh, uski patni tina, 7 varshiya divyanshu or 3 saal kii shreya ke rup main kii he
 Rakesh Nagpal had a cloth business in Chandni Chowk and was living here with his family by purchasing his flat in building number 484
 padosiyon ke aarope he ki agar dilli fire sarvice kii team samay se maukey par aa jaati to yah haadasa itnaa bhayanak rup nahin le paata
 Neighbors said that the fire was so severe that it engulfed the entire building
 aag building kii ground floor par lage electric meter se shuru hui
 The building's guard rang the building alert after seeing the smoke
 alert kii aawaaj sunakar puri building ke log neeche aa gaye, lekin nagpal parivaar neeche nahin aa paaya
 The Delhi Fire Service team recovered the bodies of four members of the Nagpal family from near the stairs
 aag kii chapet main building kii parking main khadi 5 gaadiyaan bhi aa gayi
 Also, about 10 bikes also got completely burnt
 philhal laashon ko postmortem ke liye bhej diya gaya he
 This ordinance is complete nonsense
 ise fadkar phenk dena chahie!!" sitambar 2013 ko dilli ke press club kii press vaarta main achaanak pahunche rahul gandhi kii yah mudra nai hi nahin, vismayakari bhi thi
 No one anticipated that Rahul, who always kept silence in Parliament, silence on party forums, and confusion between activism and inaction, would show his government ordinance in such a way
 congress kii surat dekhne laayak thi
 It is necessary to remind here that this ordinance was intended to stop the Supreme Court's order
 10 july, 2013 ko supreme court ne jan pratinidhitiv kanoon kii dhara-8 ko avaidh qaraar dete hue faisla sunaaya tha ki agar kisi saansad yaa vidhayak ko adaalat abhiyukt ghoshit kar detii he to uski sadsyta tatkaal khatm ho jaaegi
 The whole politics came forward in defense
 adalati aadesh par amal rokane ke liye tatkaaleen upie sarkaar ne ek adhyadesh gadha or sarvadaleey baithak ke hawaale se daawa kiya ki sabhi dal is par sahamat hai
 Political consensus was also clearly visible
 alabatta rahul ne sarkaar or party ke najariye se alag jate hue sirf yahi nahin kaha ki congress or bijepi is par raajnneeti kar rahi hai balki unki tippanee thi ki "hamen yah bevakoofi rokani hogi
 If you want to fight corruption, small agreements will not work
 " bataane kii jarurat nahin ki rahul gandhi ke virodh ke baad adhyadesh kachare ke dibbe main chalaa gaya
 This incident is not mentioned here to remind us of Rahul Gandhi's political courage or understanding
 maamla darasal iskaa ulataa he
 Rahul Gandhi is creating a new category for himself in Indian politics
 bharat ke logon ne saahsee or lambii ladaai ladane vaale netaa dekhe hai
 The Congress is seen to be scattered again
 do siton se purna bahumat tak pahunchane vaali sangharkshil bijepi dekhi he
 Have seen the third front being formed again and again
 sab kuch ganvaane ke baad dilli kii satta hasil karne vaali aam aadmi party dekhi he lekin rahul gandhi anokhe netaa hai jinhen maukey chukne main maharath hasil he
 When Rahul returns from mysterious exile and becomes active in the Congress politics next week, the risk is not for him but for the party, because the political mantra of right step for his family leader at the right time has always seemed like rocket science 
 congress agar yah samajhane kii koshish kare ki 2013 main adhyadesh ko kachare ke dibbe ke supurd karaane vaali ghatana, rahul kii ek choti dhardaar prastuti banakar kyon rah gai to use shaayad apane is rajkumaar se bachane main madad milegi
 The ordinance protecting the criminal leaders is a time when public and judicial activism was at its peak in the country
 isi dauraan adaalat ne raajnneeti main aparaadhiyon ke pravesh par sakhti kii, jise rokane ke liye sabhi dal ekajute ho gaye
 Rahul Gandhi came forward breaking the rut of traditional politics
 sattarudh dal ke sabase taqatvar netaa kaa sarkaar ke virodh main aana apratyaashit tha, lekin isse bhi zyada vismayakari yah tha ki rahul phir nepathy main gum ho gaye, jabaki yahaan se unki siyasat kaa nayaa rasta khul saktaa tha
 One has to agree that Rahul Gandhi has political understanding but it is also true that he does not understand the delicate relationship of politics and time
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jo janandolan antat congress kii sharmnaak haar or bijepi kii abhootpurv jeet kii vajah bana, vah darasal rahul gandhi ke liye avasar ban saktaa tha
 The central government was responsible for creating the Lokpal
 sabhi rajnatik dal lagbhag haashiye par the or ek janandolan sarkaar se sidhe baat kar rahaa tha
 On this occasion, if Rahul Gandhi had shown the same tursi as it was against the ordinance in September 2013 in defense of criminal leaders, then the political picture of the country would have been quite different
 yah avasar chukne main rahul kii visheshgyata kaa hi udhaaharan he ki jis nae bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon par unhone apni sarkaar par dabaav banaaya tha, use lekar jab modi sarkaar ko gherne kaa mauka aayaa to congress rajkumaar kisi anushthan main leen ho gaye
 William Ewart Gladstone, one of Britain's greatest Prime Ministers (four times Prime Minister from 1868 to 1894), is considered the pioneer of the Philosophy of Right Timing in politics
 prasiddh libral netaa or adbhut vaktaa gladstone, conservative netaa benjamin disreli ke pratispardhi the
 The leaders of the world have learned from them that accurate politics makes success at the right time
 atal bihari vaajapeyi, sonia gandhi, david camerun, baraak obama se lekar narendra modi tak sabhi rajnatik safaltaaon main gladstone kaa darshan dekha ja saktaa he
 However, only the text that teaches accurate politics at the right time was removed from Rahul Gandhi's book of political work
 pehali baar congress mahasachiv banane ke baad rahul ne dilli ke talkatoraa stadium main kaha tha ki safalataa maukey par nirbhar karti he, safal vahi hue hai jinhen maukey mili hai
 However, Rahul's politics teaches how to fail even after getting a chance
 congress ko rahul se darana chahie kyonki unka yah rajkumaar maukey chukne kaa ustad he or ''rahul kaal'' ke dauraan congress ne bhi sudharne, badalane or aage badhane ke tamaam maukey ganvaae hai
 Nevertheless, the Congress will put Rahul head on his eyes after returning from the unknown because this party considers the curse of familyism as his best fortune
 alabatta party main kisi ko rahul gandhi se yah jarur poochna chahie ki myanmar main vipashyana ke dauraan kya kisi ne unhen gautam buddha kaa yah sutara bataaya tha ki ''aapkaa yah sochna hi sabase badi samasya he ki aapke paas kaaphi samay he
 "congress and Rahul really don't have time at all now

 The world-famous Indian batsmen proved to be villains again, who dodged the good effort of the bowlers and brought India to the brink of a big defeat on the second day of the third Test cricket match against Australia

 vibhinn dharmon ke bare main shodh karne vaale ek think tanks ne apane ek vistrut adhyayan main kaha he ki britain main pichley dashak ke dauraan dharmantaran kar muslim banane vaale britainvaasiyon kii sankhya main kaaphi ijapha hua he
 This think tank named 'faith Matters' has said about the Britishers who convert to Islam, that the number of such people can be up to one lakh and about five thousand people are becoming Muslims every year
 haalanki is adhyayan se pehle dharmantaran karne vaale logon kii sankhya 14 hajaar se 25 hajaar ke bich bataai gai thi
 This number of conversions shows that the attacks on 11 September in the US and 7 July in London had no adverse effect on conversion

 # Dhoom3 is july main jab sushamaa bhadu ne chehre par ghunghat daalana band kar diya to use ehsaas bhi nahin tha ki vah ek kranti kii neenv daal rahi hai
 In June 2010, Vedhani Mian Khan was elected sarpanch of the village
 haryana main kisi bhi bahu ke liye ghunghat daale rahanaa paaramparik rup se jaruri he
 a week after removing the veil, on 22 July 2012, at a gathering of Anganwadi workers, women members of the panchayat and female students from 25 villages, Sushma made a public announcement to remove the 'hellish' veil, saying, "veil me no use
 yah mujhe aage nahin badaae detaa or parivaar yaa gaanv se jude kaamon ko karne kii raah main baadha banataa he
 And most importantly, it does not allow me to be recognized as an human being
 ’’ kam shikshit hone ke baavjood unki baton se budhimatta jhlak rahi thi
 He left school after the seventh grade
 us yuva sarpanch ne maano vahaan maujuud mahilaon kii dukhati rag chhu lee thi
 Sushma's 35-year-old husband Bhagwan Das recalled the day's scene, saying, "it was like a boom
" ’’ saikadon choti-badi umr kii mahilaon ne khadey hokar apana samarthan jataayaa or ghunghat hataate hue kasam khai ki ab ve kapade ke tukade ke us rivaaj ko dobaaraa apane ‘pichhadepan kaa sababy nahin banane dengi
 Das felt relieved when he felt that his wife was not alone and that no one could mock him
 is gaanv se parivartan kii aawaaj kone-kone main failane lagi he
 30-year-old Kamlesh Rani spills confidence with a veil-free face, stopping her new self-start scooter and asking where do we go? When we ask them about the women who shed the veil, the face of the Anganwadi worker who is working for Dhani Mian Khan and the two adjacent villages, Chaplamori and Salamkhera
 ve kahati hai, ‘‘yah aasaan nahin he
 He told that the men of the neighboring villages make fun of Dhani Mian Khan's women
 ve vyangy se kehete hai, ‘‘ab to tumhen chhot mil gai he, kuch bhi kar sakati ho
 "often, with 'anything', he refers to things that cannot be written
" ve muskaraakar kahati hai, ‘‘par ham haar nahin maanane vaale
 Noise and noise is a habit of men
 ’’ gaanv main har taraf auraton ke sughad haathon kaa sparsh dikhaai detaa he
 There are cement bricks in the streets, bulbs on the electric poles light up and every house has proper electricity and water
 naaliyaan khuli hai, lekin saaf hai
 Dhani Mian Khan, who looks like a well-decorated house, has been given the 2012 Nirmal Gram Award for cleanliness
 ghunghat hataane se pehle hi sarpanch bhadu ne ek jujharu mahila ke rup main apni pahchaan kaayam kar lee thi
 10 lakh to open a tailoring training center for women
 kaa anudaan paane ke liye ve lagaataar koshish karti raheen or aakhirkaar unhone punjab neshnal bank ko prashikshan kaarykram pryojit karne ke liye taiyaar kar hi liya
 She says in a proud voice, "we (she never talks about saying 'I') have got funds from the state government to devise a water-boosting system to further improve the water supply of our homes
" ’’ unhen shiksha puri karne kaa mauka nahin mila, lekin aaj vah is baat ko sabase zyada tarjeeh detii hai ki unke gaanv kaa har baccha skool jaae
 Since she became sarpanch, not a single child has left school in the state primary school, which will be made a secondary school by 2013
 37 varshiya manindra singh or unke sahyogi 40 varshiya chotu ram, donon hi skool main shikshak hai
 Singh, who considers the veil to be a feudal tendency, says, "it is historical
 jab yah puure haryana main fail jayega to sab kahenge ki yah yaheen se shuru hua tha
 "35-year-old Birma Devi, another member of the Dhani Mian Khan Panchayat, says the removal of the veil will give freedom to girls and girls choking under the shadow of the veil
 chandigarh ke institute for deveopment and communication kii gender studies unit kii pramukh 44 varshiya renuka dagar kahati hai ki dhani miyaan khan kii mahilaon ne ‘‘ek aise samaaj main asahmati prakat kii he, jahaan mahilaon kaa jivan asurakshit he
 "she says that notorious khap panchayats give death decrees in the name of prestige
 yahaan kii mahilaon ke ‘jivan kii dasha’ duniya main sabase kharaab he
 Dagar believes that Bhadu, who opposes the veil, has actually challenged the state government to come forward and provide greater protection to women
 achraj kii baat he ki dhani miyaan khan gaanv main uthaae gaye us bemisaal kadam ke liye rajya sarkaar kii jabaan se do maheene baad bhi saraahna ke shabd nahin nikle
 While the Mahapanchayat also announced to end female feticide; It has also announced the award for exposing those who have examined the sex of the infant and is giving scholarships to poor girls aspiring for higher education
 66 varshiya prasiddh saamaajik kaaryakarta krishna swaroop sushamaa bhadu ke is kadam ko shshek chirsthayee parinaam kii ore drudh kadam maanate hai
 "in contrast to urban women who often compromise with subordination," he says, "in the Haryanvi society, with just a veil removed 50 percent of the work was done
" lekin is ladaai ko jeetne ke liye pragatisheel svaichhik samoohon or sarkaar kaa yogadan jaruri he
 "at present, this small village of 426 women and 416 men has sunlight
 bhavishya bhi sunaharaa najar aa rahaa he
 Kamlesh Rani is very happy to count the number of children in the age group up to 6 years, "we have 51 girls and 44 boys
" ’’ ummid he ki khap panchayat ko alavida kehane kii shuruyaat ho gai he

 com / gi6bfdjm16 At a time when the BJP has issued a show cause notice to party MP Sakshi Maharaj advising Hindu women to have 'four children', another leader of his own party seems to have gone one step further
 pashchim bengal ke birbhum ke bijepi netaa shyaamalaal goswami kaa kahana he ki hindu mahilaon ko paanch bachche paidaa karne chahie
 BJP district vice-president Goswami in Virbhum said in a public meeting on Monday, 'I want to tell my Hindu mothers and sisters that if they do not produce five children, there will be imbalance in India in future
 mujhe galat mat samajhie

 The pull in the Aam Aadmi Party has been described by a senior party leader as a battle of two ideologies
 party ke ek varisht netaa ne enditivi se baatcheet main mana ki party main takaraav do alag-alag vichaardhaara ko lekar chal rahaa he
 In his view, the deadlock is on whether principles are more important for the party or victory in elections
 party ke kuch varisht netaa ye maanate hai ki kisi bhi party kii pahchaan siddhanton se banati he, chunaavon main haar-jeet se nahin
 According to him, the party should not follow its principles and move forward
 unhone enditivi se kaha ki ab party ko ye tay karnaa hoga ki uske liye chunaav jeetna zyaada zaruri he yaa phir party ke siddhant
 The stance of senior AAP leaders is clear that internal infighting continues in the Aam Aadmi Party and before the National Council meeting in late March, the way the party functions, its future direction and ideology is fixed
 The deadlock is accelerating again
 isse pehle mayank gandhi blog ke zarie party main pardarshita kii kami kaa sawaal uthaa chuke hai
 However, they are also claiming that their intention is not to weaken the party organization but to make it more transparent and stronger
 udhar party ke netaa ashutosh ne kaha he ki haal ke vivaadon se party kii chhavi par bura asar padaa he or ab party kii neshnal council ye tay karegi ki party aage kya ranneeti akhriyaar karegi
 It is clear that the questions that were raised during the exclusion of Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan from the Political Affairs Committee, are not taking the name of freezing
 party ko aaj bhi unheen sawaalon se nipatna pad rahaa he
 The news of the deal between the country's largest e-commerce company Flipkart and the world's largest retail company, Walmart, is creating fear among small and medium traders
 chembar of trade and industry (sitiai) kaa kahana he ki retail main epadiai ko abhi puri tarah se manjuuri nahin mili he
 This is why Walmart is making a thief's way to spread in India through e-commerce
 sitiai ke sanyojak brijesh goyal va hemanth gupta kaa kahana he ki maamla desh ke chote va majhole vyapaariyon se judaa he, isliye ham har tarah se iskaa virodh karenge
 The agreement that is going to happen between Walmart and Flipkart is not only a matter of concern for small and medium traders, but also for the government
 wallmart company kaa itihaas rahaa he ki yah jis desh main bhi gai he, vahaan ke sthaneey retailleron ko to puri tarah se chaupat kiya hi he, saath hi us desh kii arthvyavastha par bhi nakaaratmak asar padaa he
 The comments sitiai ke varisht upaadhyaksh pradeep gupta or mahasachiv ramesh ahuja ne bataaya ki bharat kaa retail bazaar lagbhag 40 lakh karod rupee kaa he
 This is why Walmart has been eyeing India for years
 lekin bharat sarkaar ko sochna chahie ki agar walmart jaisi company ko desh main ghusane diya jaataa he to yahaan ke chote va majhole vyapaariyon kaa kya hoga? hamaare desh kii arthvyavastha main chote va majhole vyapaariyon kaa bhi bahut yogadan he
 a large population of the country is attached to it and runs its livelihood
 doosraa ahm pahalu yah bhi he ki walmart zyaadaatar saamaan china se taiyaar karwaati he
 The introduction of Walmart into the country will again boost Chinese products
 unhone kaha ki sitiai walmart ke virodh main he or aane vaale dinon main na keval dilli balki puure desh ke vyapaariyon ke saath milakar iskaa virodh karegaa
 They say that if the need arises, there will be movement
 ham log aakhri samay tak walmart kaa virodh karte rahenge or walmart ko kisi bhi keemat par dilli main nahin ghusane denge
 CTI conveners Brijesh Goyal and Hemant Gupta say that the matter is related to small and medium traders of the country, so we will oppose it in every way
 walmart or flipcart ke bich jo qaraar hone ja rahaa he, vah na keval chote va majhole vyapaariyon ke liye to chintaa kaa vishay he hi, balki sarkaar ke liye bhi chintaa kaa vishay he
 The Walmart company has a history that it has completely destroyed the local retailers in the country it has visited, as well as the economy of that country
 tippaniyan CTI Senior Vice President Pradeep Gupta and General Secretary Ramesh Ahuja said that India's retail market is around Rs 40 lakh crore
 yahi kaaran he ki varshon se walmart kii najar bharat par lagi hui he
 But the Indian government should think that if a company like Walmart is allowed to enter the country, what will happen to the small and medium traders here? Small and medium traders also contribute a lot in our country's economy
 desh kii badi aabaadi isse judi he or apni roji roti chalaati he
 Another important aspect is that Walmart manufactures most of the goods from China
 walmart ke desh main aane se chini utpaadon ko phir badhaava milegaa
 He said that CTI is in opposition to Walmart and in the coming days it will oppose it not only in Delhi but with traders from all over the country
 unka kahana he ki jarurat padi to andolan bhi hoga
 We will keep opposing Walmart till the last time and will not allow Walmart to enter Delhi at any cost

 In the Indian Premier League (IPL) draft system, 'all-rounder' Ravindra Jadeja has become his home town, whom Rajkot's team 9
 5 karod rupee main 2016-2017 sizan ke liye kharida he
 By the way, in the IPL, Jadeja has already made a big bid
 varsh 2012 ke ipel ocshan main rabindra jadeja ko lekar zordaar boli lagi thi, or us vakt ipel khel rahi tiimon deccan chargers or chennai superkings ke bich jadeja ko kharidene ko lekar taai-braker hua tha, jiske baad jadeja 9
 72 crores went to Chennai Superkings
 is baar bhi jadeja ko acchhee rakam mili
 By the way, the relationship between Jadeja and IPL is quite old, and it is believed that the stars of the team in which Jadeja also goes, have reached the place
 darasal, is toornament main rabindra jadeja ab tak teen tiimon kaa hissaa rah chuke hai, or teenon kaa bhagya ruuth gaya
 Now call it a coincidence or something, but the team with which Jadeja was associated, got angry with that team
 tippaniyan Ravindra of Team India, affectionately called 'sir Jadeja', has so far played for ipl's Rajasthan Royals, Chennai Super Kings and Kochi Tuskers
 kochi kaa patta ipel se puri tarah saaf ho chukaa he, jabaki rajasthan or chennai kii timen do-do saal kaa bain jhel rahi hai
 Obviously, the Rajkot team's owner Intex company would like to ignore this and Jadeja also would not like to become 'unlucky' Jadeja, but how heavy will this 'unlucky Jadeja' title be for Ravindra Jadeja, also known as 'rockstar'
 , It is difficult to say at the moment

 vaise jadeja or ipel kaa rishta kaaphi purana he, or mana jaataa rahaa he ki jadeja jis team main bhi jate hai, usee ke sitare gardish main pahunch jate hai
 Actually, Ravindra Jadeja has been a part of three teams in this tournament so far, and the fate of all three was lost
 ab ise sanyog kahen yaa kuch or, lekin jis team se bhi jadeja jude, us team se rab ruuth gaya
 The comments pyaar se 'sar jadeja' kahkar bulaae jane vaale team india ke rabindra ab tak ipel kii rajasthan royles, chennai superkings or kochi taskars tiimon ke liye khel chuke hai
 Kochi leaves have been completely cleared from the IPL, while Rajasthan and Chennai teams are facing two-year ban

 Earlier, the Supreme Court rejected the petition filed against the decision of the Delhi government to give compensation of one crore rupees to the family of soldier Ramkishan Grewal

 janvari kii 19 taarikh ko kolkata main mamata banerjee ne 21 vipakshi dalon kii raily yojit kar, modi ke khilaaf jis ekajutata kii aguwai kii thi vah anayas nahin tha
 Mamta was seen leading the opposition parties under a diluted strategy and now that the last phase of voting for the Lok Sabha elections is over, the entire opposition party is seen to be united with Mamata
 kolkata main mangalvaar ko bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ke road sho ke dauraan hui hinsak ghatana ke baad bhaajapa brigade ne jahaan mamata ke khilaaf ekajute hokar hamalaa bolnaa shuru kar diya vahiin bhaajapa virdohi sabhi dal mamata ke samarthan main aa date hai

 Mamta had rallied in January before the Lok Sabha elections and started increasing opposition solidarity
 tiemasi sutron kaa kahana he ki siyaasi paristhiti aisi he jisamen bhaajapa ko haraane ke liye vipakshi ekta jaruri he or mamata banerjee iske liye lagaataar koshish kar rahi hai
 Given his efforts, the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are the most aggressive against Mamata
 modi ne bengal main kul 17 reliyaan kin or bhaajapa ke lagbhag sabhi pramukh netaa bengal main raily kar chuke hai
 For all these reasons, Mamta has come before the whole country as a leader who has appeared to challenge Modi directly
 chunaav nattejey aane ke baad yadi yadi endie purna bahumat se chookti he to aisi sthiti main agali sarkaar banane or netritv tay karne main mamata banerjee kii bhoomika sabase pramukh hogi
 a leader associated with the Telugu Desam Party says that there is a strong possibility that Mamata's name should be prominent among the possible names leading the front in the event of a United Front government

 Gopinath Munde should have breathed a sigh of relief when the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) faced a humiliating defeat in Marathwada in western Maharashtra in the Lok Sabha elections held in May
 lekin bijepi ke is chatur rajaneta ko jamini hakeekat kaa puraa ehsaas tha
 He told Narendra Modi that the party would have to keep an eye on Maharashtra
 modi jab may main apni cabinet kii ruparekha bana rahe the to munde mahayuti kii saath chunaav ladgaye vaali chah partiyon ko khush rakhane ke liye behad utsuk the
 They knew that they were eyeing the assembly elections
 lekin is saal june main dilli main india get ke paas sadq durghatana main munde kii maut ke saath hi mahayuti kii is phikr kaa bhi ant ho gaya
 Therefore, when only two days were left to fill the assembly election form on September 25, and after the paternal pass, the first auspicious day of Navratri came, the 25-year-old Mahayuti had become a history of history
 raat nau baje shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ke bete aditya thakare ne twit kiya, ‘‘yah gathjod tab se tha, jab main paidaa bhi nahin hua tha
 i grew up in an atmosphere of unity and brotherhood with BJP leaders
 ’’ yah bhavuk bayaan shivasena ke sansthaapak bal thakare ke us pautra kaa tha, jisaki jid ko is gathbandhan ke tuutane kii sabase badi vajah mana ja rahaa he
 The remaining parties of the alliance RPI, SSP, RSP and Sivasangram will also decide their stand soon
 lekin is tut kii jaden loksabhaa chunaav kii jeet ke baad se hi padane lagi thim
 In this fire, ghee was also done by that internal survey of BJP which stated that if the four parties contest alone, then BJP can get 134 seats in 288, while Shiv Sena will be reduced to 46
 aise main chunaav baad gathbandhan kii gunjaaish bachi rahegi
 At the same time, the BJP will not be untouchable even for the NCP, which has been separated from the Congress
 isiilie bijepi jhuki nahin
 The party believes that there has been no reduction in the Modi wave
 aakhir isi lahar ke sahare gathbandhan ne loksabhaa chunaavon main maharashtra kii 48 main se 42 siten jeetin
 On the other hand, the ruling congress-ncp alliance also broke
 yahaan sharad pavaar kii ensipi lagaataar congress par dabaav banaae hue thi ki uski siten badhaai jaaen, lekin congress pehle to ensipi ko lambey samay tak taalati rahi or baad main uski baat sunanaa hi band kar diya
 Whatever interference from the Congress, Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan and in some cases Ashok Chavan was seen doing
 party ne jis tarah kisi bhi kaddavar mahasachiv ko baatcheet ke liye nahin utaara usase jaahir he ki congress bhi aar-paar ke mood main thi
 On the other hand, the NCP argued that the Congress has become the chief minister in 15 years of alliance
 is baar donon dal 144-144 siton par chunaav laden or donon dalon kaa mukhyamantri dhai-dhai saal ke liye kursi par baithe
 That is, both sides were taking such a stubborn attitude that the gambling of the alliance should fall off their shoulders
 25 sitambar ko gathbandhan todgaye kaa elaan karne vaali press conference main ensipi netaa prafull patel, ajit pavaar or sunil tatkaare ne congress par unki maangon ko na sunne kaa aarope lagaaya
 The NCP has roamed in the wheel of time, where it was born 15 years ago
 us samay congress netaa sharad pavaar ne sonia gandhi ke videshi mul kaa mudda uthaakar congress chhod di thi or apni party ensipi kaa gathan kiya tha
 But the fear of shared votes forced the new party to join hands with the Congress immediately
 15 saal ke satta bhoga ke baad raajnneeti ke manje khilaadi sharad pavaar hawa kaa rukh samaj rahe hai
 On the other hand, Mulayam Singh Yadav is also sensing the wind
 gathbandhan tuutane ke baad congress ke saath aane main samaajawaadee party ne khaasi dilchaspee dikhaai he
 The party leadership, without losing time, gave Abu Asim Azmi an open hand to talk to the Congress
 lekin sawaal he ki is khule mukaable main congress or ensipi ke haath kya aane vaala he? or kya taaja sameekaran maharashtra kii raajnneeti main raaj thakare kii maharashtra navnirmaan shivasena ke liye koi nari bhoomika kholane vaala he
 Yes, all parties will have their own slogans in this election, but the BJP will also have a talisman named Modi
 aane vaale dinon main teen rajyon main vidhaan sabha chunaav hone hai, vahaan bhaajapa vikaas ke alaava dhara 370 or 35 (A) ko khatm karne ko bhi apana chunavi mudda banaaegi
 a glimpse of this was seen in Jamtara, Jharkhand on Wednesday
 yahaan BJP ke rashtriya adhyaksh or kendriya grahamantri amit shah ne manch se kaha ki is baar ke chunaav main log yah tay karenge ki jo anuchhed 370 ke paksh main hai unke saath rahanaa hai yaa jinhone isko hataakar pakistan ko uski jagah dikhaane kaa kaam kiya, unke saath rahanaa he
 Please tell that Amit Shah reached Jamtara at the inaugural function of Jan Aashirwad Yatra of Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubar Das
 shah ne apane bhaashan main kaha ki jab se anuchhed 370 khatm kiya gaya he, tab se puri duniya main ek sandesh gaya ki kashmir bharat kaa abhinn ang he
 Taking a dig at the opposition parties, especially the Congress and the JMM, he said that both of them opposed the decision in the Lok Sabha to abolish Article 370
 aap bataaie inkaa saath denge yaa jinhone anuchhed 370 khatm kiya, uskaa saath denge
 He also appealed to the people to raise their hands on this issue and extend their public support
 amit shah ne apane bhaashan ke dauraan kai aankade dekar yah sabit karne kii koshish kii ki jab se centre main narendra modi kii sarkaar bani he, tab se rajya main vikaas mad main centre se upie sarkaar kii tulana main dhai guna zyada paisa aayaa he
 He also mentioned the number of beneficiaries of Jharkhand in various central schemes and explained how their number has increased
 kya aapke mobile number ko aadhaar se link karne ke liye mobile oparator kii ore se aapako baar-baar kaha ja rahaa he? agar aap soch rahe hai ki isaki koi jaldi nahin he or sarkaar is bare main apane faisle par dobaaraa vichaar karegi to thahrie or saavdhaan ho jaaie
 Know that the government is not going to step back in this matter
 sarkaar main ucch padasth sutron ne india today ko bataaya kimobile numberko aadhaar se link karne kii jo dedline tay he usamen koi badlaav nahin hone ja rahaa
 If you have not linked your mobile number to Aadhaar by 6 February 2018, then your mobile connection will be de-activated
 bataa den ki mobile ko aadhaar se link karne kaa desh main kai str par vyapak virodh ho rahaa he
 At the same time, the government believes that this is the only process of identification at the central level and it cannot be misused in a fake way
 jahaan tak sarkaar ke is kadam ke virodh kii baat he to abhi haal main pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne kaha tha, ‘main apana mobile aadhaar se link nahin karuungi, chaahe to ve meraa phone kaat sakate hai
 Ever since the government has instructed the mobile operators to link the mobile base, 50 crore consumers in the country have followed this instruction
 ab bhi desh main 60 karod upabhokta aise hai jinhen apane mobile ko aadhaar se link karnaa baaki he
 Opponents argue that linking Aadhaar with various schemes and facilities is an encroachment of their civil liberties and privacy
 bataa den ki aadhaar se judi yachikaaon par supreme court main sunwaayee jari he
 The petitioners were hopeful of a decision of a 9-judge bench of the Supreme Court in August
 is faisle main supreme court ne samvidhan ke anuchhed 21 or part 3 ke tahat niztaa ko moulik adhikaar bataaya tha
 The petitioners are urging the Supreme Court for early adjudication in the Aadhaar case, while the government has requested to postpone the hearing till March in its latest filing
 atorni general ke ke venugopal ne buudhvaar ko sarkaar kii taraf se pairvi karte kaha ki is maamle par koi bhi aadesh tab tak roke rahanaa chahie jab tak sarkaar data protection bill kaa draft taiyaar karne kii prakriya puri nahin kar leti
 The central government started this process on 31 July 2017
 sarkaar us aanshaka ko khatm karne ke liye is kadam ko uthaaya ki kahin aadhaar ko vibhinn yojanaon or sevaaon ke saath link karnaa anivaary karne par sarkaar ke paas jo vaiyaktik data he wo kahin baahar naa aa jaae
 The government has constituted a committee headed by former Supreme Court judge BN Srikrishna that will set the standards for data protection
 is bich centre ne court main kaha he ki wo kareeb 135 sarkari kalyaan yojanaon ke liye aadhaar ko link karne kii dedline badhaane ke liye taiyaar he
 However, no order or notification has been received yet
 sarkaar ne kaha tha ki dedline 31 disambar 2017 se 31 march 2018 tak badhaai ja sakati he lekin sirf unheen ke liye jinke abhi tak aadhaar card nahin bane hai
 This new development came after the embarrassment of the state government after the starvation death of a 11-year-old girl in Jharkhand
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ladki ke parivaar kaa rashancard haal main radd kar diya gaya kyonki wo aadhaar se link nahin tha
 The Center is ready to give exemption in case of government schemes and event like Jharkhand but it is not ready to back down in case of linking mobile number to Aadhaar
 ucch padasth sarkari sutron ne india today se kaha, ‘logon ko niztaa or pahchaan main fark samajhnaa chahie
 Aadhaar data is stored in a central database and cannot be disclosed
 aadhaar card kii nakal nahin ban sakati
 When the linking of Aadhaar number to any service is confirmed, the data does not run anywhere from the central server
 agar kisi vyakti ke adhikaron kii raksha ke liye or kadamon kii jarurat mahasoos kii jaaegi to iti act main sanshodhan karne ke liye bhi sarkaar taiyaar he
 However, the ball is in the Supreme Court courtroom
 bharat ratna sachin tendulkar ne mumbai or tamilnadu ke bich 1999-2000 satr main vankhede stadium main khele gaye ranjai trophy semifinal ko is championships kaa apana sabase yaadgaar match qaraar diya
 "I would say it was a 1999-2000 semi-final against Tamil Nadu," Tendulkar said in response to a question at a function organized to celebrate Mumbai's 500th Ranji Trophy match against Baroda
 unhone saath hi bataaya ki kis tarah mumbai ne safaltaapurvak tamilnadu ke pehali pari ke 485 ran ke score ko paar kiya jab unke saath krij par antim ballebaaj santosh saxena the
 Tendulkar, who scored a double century in this match, said that it suddenly started to reverse swing after the umpires switched balls
 unhone kaha, 'maine krij ke baahar khadaa hona shuru kiya or hemang badani gendbaaj ko point se tamil main kahata tha ki main baahar khadaa hum
 After that, when the bowler started the run up, i would go back to the crease
 sachin ne kaha ki maine match ke baad badani se kaha ki mujhe tamil samaj aati he
 Mumbai won the match by eight wickets
 sachin tendulkar ne saath hi kaha ki ranjai maichon menmumbai kii safalataa kaa pratishat47 he jo behtareen he
 During this time, Madhav Apte, Ajit Wadekar, Dilip Vengsarkar, Sudhir Naik, Sanjay Manjrekar and Amol Majumdar also told the story of the dominance of Mumbai in their respective times
 ranjai trophy main 41 baar kii champion mumbai kii team ne baroda ke khilaaf vankhede stadium main rashtriya championships kaa 500waan match khelaa or yah uplabdhi hasil karne vaali pehali team bani
 The team gave India the most international cricketers in all the three formats, but even this figure is not enough to explain its impact on the Indian team
 mumbai ranjai team ne bhartiya team ko tendulkar, gavaskar, dilip vengsarakar, ekanath solkar, dilip saradesai or rohit sharma jaise digagj khilaadi die hai

 Wearing a slim, print salwar kurta and dupatta, black glasses and a gentle smile on his face, ease of conversation and familiarity - 28-year-old Aditi looks like a girl in the neighborhood
 in dinon toyta forchunar se raat-din chunaav prachaar main juty aditi singh main bahut kuch aisa he jise dekhakar logon ko yakeen karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he ki ve hai koun
 It is discussed that when she first met Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, she was not even sure whose daughter she is! Aditi is a post graduate in Business Management from Duke University, USA
 ab raajnneeti hi unka bijness he or chunaav prachaar kaa management hi unki asli pariksha
 Aditi Rae Bareli is going to be the Congress candidate from Sadar
 yah vahi seat he jis par unke pita or bahubali netaa akhilesh singh paanch baar vidhayak rah chuke hai
 Akhilesh is also the sitting MLA from this seat
 akhilesh singh par hatya, lut, apharan or hatya kii sajeesh samet tamaam mukademe darj hai
 But, his image in the area is similar to Robin Hood's, who rob the rich and help the poor
 akhilesh jail main band rahakar nirdaleey bhi chunaav jeet jate hai
 Everyone believes that it is not easy to defeat Akhilesh Singh on this seat
 girte swasthya or umr kii vajah se is baar akhilesh singh ne apni rajnatik viraasat apni beti ko saunpane kaa faisla kar liya he
 Dawn's daughter! Hardly any girl likes to hear this
 lekin ye puche jane par aditi hansate hue kahati hai ki unhen ab ye sunne kii aadat ho chuki he, ab ve iskaa bura bhi nahin maanatin
 Aditi says her decision to enter politics was her own
 unke mata-pita ne unhen acchhee shiksha di lekin jab unke pita ne kaha ki unki sehat aisi nahin he ki itani bhaag-daud kar saken to unhone fouran ye tay kar liya ki raibareli laut kar pita kaa haath bantaana he
 Aditi says that her father's image is such that people do not believe that both she and her younger sister went abroad and got higher education
