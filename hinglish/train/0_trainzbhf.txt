 Since then, the process of opening of engineering and medical coaching centers in Kakadev and its surrounding areas Geetnagar, Navinagar has also started
 aaj sthiti yah he ki kakadev or aasapaas ke ilaakon main akele ejineering or medical kii pravesh parikshaon kii taiyaari karaane ke liye chote-bade 100 se adhik centre kaam kar rahe hai
 These coaching centers mainly consist of Bhabha Classes, New Speed institute, Sigma Classes, New Light Coaching Institute, Raj Kushwaha Classes and Anees Srivastava Classes
 new speed institute ke harsh mishra bataate hai ki kanpur main ejineering or medical pravesh parikshaon kii koching uttar bharat ke duusare bade centre rajasthan ke kota ke mukaable kaaphi sasti padati he
 He says, 'the coaching fees for an engineering subject in Kanpur is Rs 15,000
 salanaa he to medical main teen subject kii kul fees 50,000 ru
 While the quota is 20 to 25 per cent higher, the same fee
 kam fees or behtareen padhai se kanpur ke koching centre uttar bharat ke students ke bich teji se lokapriy ho rahe hai

 Apart from this, coaching institutes are wooing the students by providing air conditioning classrooms and library facilities

 The beginning was just with degree courses, but as a result of the increasing needs of students and the competition among academic institutions, coaching classes have also been added to the institute's journey in the last one year, in which around 2,000 students have been given CAT-MAT, Bank PO and Coaching classes are being conducted for MCA entrance exam

 Agarwal says, "keeping in mind the preparations for the national level competitive exam and the increasing interest of students in government jobs, free coaching classes are the biggest need for college students, so that students can be given a holistic education

 The number of such small and big coaching institutes in Patna has crossed 1,500

 But such situation remained as long as there were few coaching institutes in Patna

 Although such examples are few, still students used to go to Kota, but now teachers of famous place like Kota are starting to freeze in Patna

 There are many reasons for the increasing number of coaching institutes and increasing acceptance of students
 pehle zyaadaatar koching institute shaikshanik silebus ko complit karaane ke liye chalaae jate the, jo shiksha sansthaanon main adhure rah jate the
 At the moment, coaching is emerging as a strong option due to the pathetic condition of the degree colleges in the state and the opportunities for jobs in government and non-government institutions

 Shashi Kumar says that the change in the syllabus of engineering has also boosted the expansion of coaching

 It cost Rs 5 lakh, which was not possible for his farmer father, but in Patna the course will be completed in one and a half lakh

 Indore: The coaching business is in its boom in the industrial city of Madhya Pradesh
 har saal lagbhag dedh lakh students apni padhai puri karne ke baad inhen koching institute main aasraa pate hai
 Komal Sharma, director of local coaching center Rankers Point, says, “we prepare 3,000 students every year for the entrance examinations of iits, AIIMS and other institutes
 ' rankers point kii ames ke exam main top 20 main sthaan paane vaali indore kii aditi mohataa kahati hai, ''mujhe indore main taiyaari kaa maahaul bahut hi behtareen mila or ab main duusare logon ko bhi yahaan aakar taiyaari karne kii salaah duungi
 He is right to say, after all, with the proper coaching environment in the city, the arrival of reputed institutions has changed a lot
 indore main neemuch, jhabua, alirajpur, satna, mandsaur or ratlam jaise ilaakon se chaatr ejineering or doctorl kii koching ke liye aa rahe hai
 National level institutes like Akash and Fitzgee have also made their base here
 brinmasters, kaitalizer or kalpavriksha jaise koching institute bhi bacchon main lokapriy ho rahe hai
 Director of Brainmasters Drs
 pankaj gupta kehete hai, 'ham har saal doctor banane ke icchhuk 1,800 students ko ajukeshan dete hai or inamen se acchhee-khaasi sankhya main students safal bhi hote hai
 'one reason for coaching to grow in this way is that iits and iims also have a place together
 yah baat yahaan ke sthaneey bacchon ko prerit karti he, or ve apane hi shahar main apane dream institute main padhai kar sakate hai
 Anand Katakavar, director of Stratford Academy, says, "indore is doing well in terms of number of students going from here to engineering and medical
" ' yah rujhaan kaayam rahane vaala he
 Today, engineering, medical and management related courses are becoming a guarantee of excellent career
 antarrashtriya str par sambhaavnaaon ke pankh failaane se pratispardhaa main kai guna ijapha hua he, iske sanket hamen har saal barahavin kaksha kii katof se bhi mili jate hai
 In such an environment, what could be better than finding a wayfarer
 aisa nahin he ki aap koching ke bina kuch nahin kar sakate
 Success is possible even without coaching, but by taking level coaching the path to success can be made easier
 isiilie ab iity or medical ke liye chhathi class se koching kii vyavastha hone lagi he
 In this way a strong base begins to form
 isse kariyar kii raah ke milastone bina kisi baadha ke puure hote jate hai
 But keep in mind one thing that make coaching your strength, not crutches
 ‘koching ko baisakhi nahin, apni takat banaaen’praveen malhotra, kariyar counsalaraj ejineering, medical or management se jude corcej behtareen kariyar kii guarantee ban rahe hai
 By spreading the wings of possibilities at the international level, competition has increased manifold, we also get indications from the cutoff of class XII every year
 aise maahaul main agar koi raah dikhaane vaala mil jaae to usase behatar kya ho saktaa he
 It's not like you can't do anything without coaching
 koching ke bina bhi kamyaabi sambhav he lekin stareey koching lene se kamyaabi kii raah ko aasaan kiya ja saktaa he
 That is why arrangements are being made for coaching for iits and medical from sixth grade
 is tarah ek majboot base bananaa shuru ho jaataa he
 With this, the milestones of the career path are completed without any hindrance
 lekin ek baat kaa dhyaan rakhen ki koching ko apni takat banaaen, baisakhi nahin
 Why take coaching? Coaching can be effective in many ways
 jaise students ko kadi mehnat karte apane jaise kai or bhi log bhi dikhte hai, isi vajah se unki padhai main dilchaspee bani rahati he
 Preparing alone poses a risk of impacting focus in the long term
 koching kaa ek sabase bada phayda mock test bhi hote hai
 These tests, which occur from time to time, give students an opportunity to understand the subject and they also get to know how much water they are in
 koching centre students ko yah samajhate hai ki kis section ko kis tarah kiya janaa chahie
 Students come to know their shortcomings and they also know which side they have to strengthen
 phir aapaki koi bhi samasya ho, use hal karne vaale yahaan maujuud rahete hai lekin self study main problem aane par madad ke liye intjaar karnaa padataa he jabaki koching main problem chutkiyon main sulajhaa lee jaati he
 Whether it is IIT exams or premedical tests, their base is NCERT books only
 is vajah se koching centre students ke fundamental clear kar dete hai
 This also makes school education strong
 revijan ho jaataa he
 But always keep in mind that do not stop paying attention in class
 kai bachche yah sochate hai ki ve koching le rahe hai to ab sab ho jayega
 But this is not the case at all
 aapako khud mehnat kerani hi hogi
 Keep in mind before coaching: First of all, identify your capacity
 iity ho yaa medical, ji-tod mehnat kii jarurat hoti he
 Therefore, take a decision with thought
 parents ko bhi bacchon par apane faisle nahin thopane chahie
 If you join coaching with any doubt then try not to give full money together
 pahalen tri kar len
 If you are unable to manage, you should not force yourself
 khud par dabaav daalane se kuch bhi achche kii ummid nahin kii ja sakati
 Take care today
 Coaching centers that boast big booms have grown like mushrooms
 institute chunane se pehle uske bare main achche se jaankaree juta len
 Like, how is the faculty? suni-sunai baton par yakeen na karen kyonki frenchiji system ke chalate kai tarah kii dhokhebaaji ho sakati he
 Thoroughly research the old results of the institute
 purv chaatro se milen
 You can also ask for trial classes before joining
 study material ke bare main bhi input juta len
 With the advent of online technology, the coaching scene is changing
 is digital daur main jaruri nahin ki har koi apane ghar se dur jaakar kota main koching le
 Many coaching centers are working to provide necessary study material and help to the children right from home through online tutorials
 aap online sawaal bhi kar sakate hai or chutkiyon main apni problem kaa samaadhaan bhi jaan sakate hai
 These classes are also like regular coaching
 persenelity deveopmentkai institutes main entrens test paas karne ke baad intervyuu yaa jidi hota he, aise main koching centre vyaktitv vikaas main madad kar sakate hai
 This thing may not be applicable to the children of big cities, but it is very helpful for students of small cities
 yahaan students ko apni baat prabhavi dhang se kehane kaa mauka diya jaataa he
 With such practice, students can present themselves well

 This candidate belongs to the scheduled tribe and has taken Sanskrit and Science as a second language
 sabase anokhi baat yah he ki parikshaarthi ke photo ke sthaan par rashtrapita mahatma gandhi kii photo bhi laga hua he
 College principal Awadhesh Kumar Singh said that Mahatma Gandhi, the candidate of this roll number, has been absent in the records by the Mahatma Gandhi College Center
 shiksha vibhaag ke system kaa isse zyada apmaan kya hoga ki shararti tatwon ne na sirf aavedan kiya, balki rashtrapita mahatma gandhi kii photo bhi aavedan main chaspa kar diya

 sansad ke donon hi sadanon main buudhvaar ko satta paksh or vipaksh aamane saamne the
 At the center of all the ruckus was the statement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which he gave in the Gujarat elections
 piem modi kaa purv pradhanmantri doctor manmohan singh par pakistan ke saath sajeesh kaa aarope centre sarkaar kaa sheetakaaleen satr main bhi peechha nahin chhod rahaa he
 Significantly, on Wednesday, the Prime Minister lives in the Lok Sabha
 yahi vajah he kii congress ke netaa puri yojana ke saath sadan main pahunche the
 As soon as PM Modi entered the house, the movement in the Congress camp intensified
 sadan kii karwai shuru hui ke kuch second main hi congress saansad apni seat se wel kii ore aane lage
 But he had no idea that Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan was on alert mode even more than him
 unhone sadan kii karrwai 1 ghante ke liye sthagit kar di or iske saath hi congress party ke haath se piem ko gherne kaa mauka nikal gaya
 Meanwhile, there was a different picture in the Rajya Sabha
 is maamle ko lekar aahat purv piem manmohan singh baithe the or congress saansad hallaa kar rahe the
 mps shouting 'PM apologies, PM come to the house' were excited
 kuch back benture idhar-udhar dekh rahe the ki wel main jane kaa ishaara mili to aage bade
 The Leader of the House, Arun Jaitley and BJP President Amit Shah, sitting in the Treasury Bench, were trying to listen to the Speaker
 vekaiya naidu ke liye yah role nayaa bhale hi ho, par haavbhaav se vah na sirf control main dikh rahe the, balki pradarshnakariyon ko halki daant bhi suna rahe the-'aap house nahin chalane dena chaahate, aap had naa paar karen
 
 
 'even when this was not discussed, the Speaker adjourned the house for 45 minutes
 par waapas lautne par sabhapati mahoday us strict principal kii tarah dikhe jo class main anushaasan dekhnaa chahta he
 That is why Venkaiah Naidu made clear that when the proceedings started at 12 o'clock, the PM has not made this statement in the House, so there is no question of his clarification or apology
 centre sarkaar ne bhale hi buudhvaar ko musiibat ke badalon ko dur rakhaa he par sarkaar ke mantri bhi jaanate hai ki is maamle main donon ke bich than gai he
 On the one hand, there are no two opinions in the Congress camp on the matter that they want to clarify on this issue from the Prime Minister
 darasal dow manmohan singh piem ke bayaan se kaaphi aahat hai
 Kemn Mohan has generally reacted to the pm's statement on this issue
 congress sutron kii maane to wo khud bhi is baat par ade hai ki pradhanmantri is masale par safai de
 Jaitley, on behalf of the government, met the Leader of Opposition, Nabi Azad, and tried to resolve the matter, but apart from PM, the Congress does not want any further clarification from anyone
 aise main sadan main ye nok-jhonk abhi khatm nahin honevaali

 club) on Dec 11, 2017 at 10:47 pm PST pakistan main nai sarkaar kaa gathan ho gaya he or bharat ke saath rishton ko lekar raajnneetik bayaanbaji bhi tej ho gai he
 Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi claims that India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has offered talks with Imran Khan
 is bich congress netaa manishankar ayyar ne bhi pakistan se sambandhon ko lekar bayaan diya he
 Iyer has said that talks should begin with Pakistan
 unhone kaha ki hamen is prakaar kaa risk uthaanaa hi hoga
 The Congress leader said that the new government led by Imran Khan in Pakistan has been formed in a democratic manner
 vahiin pakistanividesh mantrike bayaan par unhone kaha ki vah mere kareebi dost hai
 But i think the Modi government sitting in Delhi will take some kind of decision
 kyonki sarkaar apane aakhri saal main he
 The Congress leader said that the new government will come next year, i hope that it will initiate a dialogue with Pakistan
 aapako bataa den ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne purv kendriya mantrimanishankar ayyarka party se nilamban tatkaal prabhaav se radd kar diya he
 During the Gujarat assembly elections last year, Iyer was suspended from the party for making controversial remarks that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was a 'lowly man'
 sirf cricket ke khel ke lihaaz se purv bhartiya captain rahul dravid ne bharat or pakistan ke bich cricket series kii tarfadaari kii he
 Dravid said, "only in terms of this game, a cricket series between India and Pakistan can be welcomed any day
 ' But he also said in the same breath that this series is not just limited to cricket but because of the security and political issues involved in it, the decision should be left on both the cricket boards
 bharat-paak cricket series ko lekar chaahe kai sawaal barqaraar hon lekin ye ishaara bhi saafe ho rahaa he ki is series ke aayojan ke liye bisisiai bhi koshishen tej kar rahaa he
 BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur told a press conference in Chandigarh that there could be talks in the weeks leading up to the series
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki baat filhal do board ke bich hi hui he
 There is no talk about it at the government level
 tippaniyan Since the meeting of Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan and Jagmohan Dalmiya, the movement for the hosting of the biggest series of cricket is increasing
 kolkata main shehryaar khan or jagmohan daalamia kii sanyukt press kanference main disambar main 3 test, 5 vanade or 2 tii20 kii series kaa prastaav rakhaa gaya
 But the controversy arose as soon as the proposal for this series was made and it was a lot
 bisisiai ke sachiv or hamirpur se bijepi ke saansad anuraag thakur bade hi sanbhalkar ishaara kar rahe hai ki ye series mumkin to he lekin sarkaar ne ise lekar abhi kisi tarah kaa man nahin banaaya he
 Actually, the matter has not been delivered to the government by planning
 wo kehete hai ki filhal baatcheet do board ke str par hi he or wo bhi shuruaati daur main
 That is why, at the moment, one should understand the same gesture that there is a long way between this series happening or not
 lekin unhone usee saans main ye bhi kaha ki ye series sirf cricket tak simit nahin balki isamen suraksha or raajnneetik masalon ke shaamil hone kii vajah se iskaa faisalaa donon cricket board par hi chhod dena chahie
 There are many questions about the indo-pak cricket series, but it is also clear that the BCCI is also intensifying efforts to organize this series
 bisisiai ke sachiv anuraag thakur ne chandigarh main ek press kanference main bataaya ki is series ko lekar aanevaale hafton main bhi baaten ho sakati hai
 He also said that the matter has only happened between the two boards
 sarkaar ke str par abhi ise lekar koi baat nahin hui he
 The comments pakistan cricket board ke adhyaksh shehryaar khan or jagmohan daalamia kii mulaaqaat ke baad se cricket kii sabase badi series ke aayojan ko hone ko lekar sargarmi tej hoti ja rahi he
 a series of 3 Tests, 5 odis and 2 T20s were proposed in December at the joint press conference of Shaharyar Khan and Jagmohan Dalmiya in Kolkata
 lekin is series ke prastaav ke aate hi vivaad bhi khadey ho gaye or ye lazimi bhi tha
 Anurag Thakur, secretary of BCCI and BJP MP from Hamirpur, is cautiously pointing out that this series is possible, but the government has not made up its mind yet
 darasal baat sarkaar tak yojana banaakar pahunchaai hi nahin gai he
 He says that the conversation is currently at the level of two boards and that too in the initial stages
 isliye filhal itnaa hi ishaara samajhnaa chahie ki is series ke hona yaa nahin hone ke bich ek lanbaa rasta baaqi he
 There are many questions about the indo-pak cricket series, but it is also clear that the BCCI is also intensifying efforts to organize this series
 bisisiai ke sachiv anuraag thakur ne chandigarh main ek press kanference main bataaya ki is series ko lekar aanevaale hafton main bhi baaten ho sakati hai
 He also said that the matter has only happened between the two boards
 sarkaar ke str par abhi ise lekar koi baat nahin hui he
 The comments pakistan cricket board ke adhyaksh shehryaar khan or jagmohan daalamia kii mulaaqaat ke baad se cricket kii sabase badi series ke aayojan ko hone ko lekar sargarmi tej hoti ja rahi he
 a series of 3 Tests, 5 odis and 2 T20s were proposed in December at the joint press conference of Shaharyar Khan and Jagmohan Dalmiya in Kolkata
 lekin is series ke prastaav ke aate hi vivaad bhi khadey ho gaye or ye lazimi bhi tha
 Anurag Thakur, secretary of BCCI and BJP MP from Hamirpur, is cautiously pointing out that this series is possible, but the government has not made up its mind yet
 darasal baat sarkaar tak yojana banaakar pahunchaai hi nahin gai he
 He says that the conversation is currently at the level of two boards and that too in the initial stages
 isliye filhal itnaa hi ishaara samajhnaa chahie ki is series ke hona yaa nahin hone ke bich ek lanbaa rasta baaqi he
 Since the meeting of Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan and Jagmohan Dalmiya, the movement for the hosting of the biggest series of cricket is increasing
 kolkata main shehryaar khan or jagmohan daalamia kii sanyukt press kanference main disambar main 3 test, 5 vanade or 2 tii20 kii series kaa prastaav rakhaa gaya
 But the controversy arose as soon as the proposal for this series was made and it was a lot

 Actually, the matter has not been delivered to the government by planning
 wo kehete hai ki filhal baatcheet do board ke str par hi he or wo bhi shuruaati daur main
 That is why, at the moment, one should understand the same gesture that there is a long way between this series happening or not

 Railway employees from other states have started leaving the station, so the railways have to stop all services
 karmchaariyon or unke pariwaron ke anusaar kashmir ke haalat aise nahi hai ki vahaan par kaam kiya ja sake yaa phir vahaan rahaa ja sake
 People are struggling with the problem of even eating and drinking there

 june maheenaa biit jane ke baad bhi rashtriya rajdhani nai dilli samet uttar bharat ko joardaar barish kaa intjaar he, vahiin monsoon kii kami se garmi or tapish bhi lagaataar bad rahi he
 On the other hand, torrential rain is raining in the financial capital Mumbai and its surrounding areas, due to which more than 16 people have died so far

 Humans as well as animals and birds face difficulties
 sookhe or isaki vajah se bheeshan garmi tathaa baadh se har saal desh ko jan-dhan kii baari kshati hoti he
 Since independence due to these two natural disasters, not only lakhs of people have died, but the country has also suffered loss of several lakh crores
 3 lakh karod rupye kaa nuksaanauttar bharat main bhale hi abhi barish kaa intjaar kiya ja rahaa ho lekin jab isaki shuruyaat hoti he to isse judi tabaahi har tarah kii tabaahi ko peeche chhod detii he
 Apart from Mumbai, many states including Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Northeast India are affected by heavy rains every year
 har saal tabaahi ke dauraan or iske baad isse bachane ke upayon par jamkar charchaa or bahes bhi hoti he, lekin vakt guzarane ke saath ise bhula diya jaataa he
 This time also no concrete steps have been taken to avoid floods
 pichley saal march main rajyasabha main barish or baadh se jude puche gaye ek sawaal par kendriya jal sansaadhan, nadi vikaas or ganga sangrakshan vibhaag rajya mantri arjuna ram meghavaal ne bataaya ki 1953 se lekar 2017 tak barish or baadh kii vajah se desh ko 3 lakh 65 hajaar 860 karod rupye kaa nuksaan hua tha
 More than 1 lakh people (1,07,487) fell due to floods and rains
 1977 main ai sabase badi vipadasarkaar kii ore se kaha gaya ki 1953 se 2017 ke bich baari barish or baadh se hui tabaahi main in gujarey 64 saalon main kul 1,07,487 log is vinaash kii bhent chadh gaye
 The 1977 natural disaster on the basis of mass loss was the most disastrous as 11,316 people lost their lives the most this year
 1977 kii vipadaa ke 11 saal baad duusari sabase badi vipadaa ai 1988 main jisamen 4,252 logon kii maut ho gai
 In the last 64 years, more than 3 thousand people died due to floods 6 times
 sarkaar kii ore se pesh aankadon main 1953 main baadh aapadaa main sabase kam 37 log maare gaye
 After this, in 1965, 79 people died
 baadh or baari barish se har saal hone vaali mauton main koi kami nahin aa rahi
 1700 are killed every year from 1976 to 2017, every year (except 745 deaths in 1999 and 933 deaths in 2012), the number of deaths from this natural calamity has been more than 1 thousand
 ausatan har saal 1,654 log pani kii aapadaa ke bhent chadh jate hai
 If we talk about loss of crop, house and public property due to water related disaster, then in the last 64 years, there was a loss of Rs 3,65,860 crore
 2013 or 2015 kaa saal sabase vinaashkari saal sabit hua
 In 2013, torrential rains in Uttarakhand showed their devastation, including 36937
 843 karod rupye saarvajanik sampatti barish kii bhent chadh gaye
 Whereas, on assessing the damage to public property as well as crop and house, this loss 47348
 751 karod rupye tak rahaa
 Huge damage to crops and houses After 2 years, the natural calamity in 2015 resulted in crop and houses as well as public property (32,200
 182 karod rupye) ko baari nuksaan hua jo pichley 64 saalon main sabase zyada rahaa
 57291 this year
 099 karod is aapadaa main swaha ho gaye
 5628 as property other than life on average every year
 628 karod pani main bah jate hai, lekin prashasan har saal ise sudhaarney kaa vaada karata he jo sirf jubaani vaade hote hai
 On the other hand, floods caused the least damage to crops and houses in 1965 and 7 that year
 135 karod rupye kii sampatti hi barbaad hui
 Since 1967, there was a loss of more than 150 crores every year, which went on increasing year by year and in 1977 this loss crossed the thousand crore mark for the first time
 bheeshan garmi se 9 saalon main 6100 logon kii mautbaadh se behisaab vipadaa aati he to sookhe se bhi kam tabaahi nahin hoti
 More than 6,100 people have lost their lives due to the drought from 2010 to 2018, with the highest number of deaths being recorded in 2015 and a third of the total deaths during this period
 is dauraan sookhe se sabase zyada prabhavit log andhra pradesh ke rahe
 According to an answer given in Parliament, in 2015, 2081 people died due to heat and heat
 avibhajit andhra pradesh main 2081 main akele 1,422 logon kii maut ho gai
 However, the number of deaths due to severe heat has decreased
 2016 main 700 or 2018 main 20 logon kii maut hui
 In 2010, 269 people died due to heat
 desh main prakritik aapadaaon se har saal hajaaron kii sankhya main log maare jate hai
 The devastation of floods causes huge loss of life and property, as well as loss of revenue
 vahiin sookhe or garmi se bhi logon ko khaasaa takalif uthaani padati he
 In the last decade, the scorching heat has made the Earth extremely hot and now in many places the temperature remains close to 45 degrees Celsius, but we talk about trying to improve the environment but in reality there is no improvement
 baadh kii vibheeshikaa se bihar, purvottar or upi samet kai rajya har saal prabhavit hote hai, lekin aaj tak ham koi thos pragati nahin hasil kar sake
 Right now we are waiting for the rain, but once it starts, everywhere we will start to face the news of houses collapsing due to floods, ruining crops and killing people

 Both the Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena parties have been encouraged by the success in the Lok Sabha elections
 rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) ke netaa jis tareeke se tuutakar bijepi main shaamil ho rahe hai, usase maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis kaa confidence badha hua he
 But despite this, he does not want to leave any scope for his party to be shocked in the election

 According to the bjp's plan, the Chief Minister will address 104 rallies, 228 welcome meetings and 20 press conferences
 yatra ke dauraan fadanvis rajya kii sabhi vidhansabhaon kaa daura karenge
 The BJP has raised the slogan of 'once again Shivshahi government' and 'this time 220'
 fadanvis sunenge gile-shikavevidhansabha or loksabhaa chunaav alag-alag pattern par lade or jite jate hai
 People look at the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections differently at the time of voting
 lihaaja, fadanvis apni taraf se aisi koi gunjaaish nahin chhodana chaahate hai jisase loksabhaa main jo matadaata bijepi ke saath rahaa he, vah vidhansabha chunaav main alag raah chun le
 In fact, Fadnavis has struggled on many fronts in the last five years

 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ke bete aditya ne haalanki mukhyamantri pad par khud kii ummidavaari par saaf-saaf to kuch nahin kaha he
 But it is definitely said that it is up to the public to decide whether they have to be ready to sit on the post or not
 main iske bare main baat nahin kar saktaa kyonki yah ekmaatr aisi cheez he jo mere haath main nahin he
 Aditya further said that it is in my hands to fulfill the promises made by Shiv Sena
 is baar mana ja rahaa he ki agar inaki sarkaar ai to donon partiyaan dhai-dhai saal mukhyamantri kii kursi kii kaman sanbhaalenge
 The Shiv Sena is constantly expressing its intention

 But on Thursday, the England Cricket Board did something that it seems that the good days of Hindi are coming
 darasal, england cricket board ke aadhikarik twitor profile se hindi main twit kiya gaya
 This is a very shocking incident, as it usually does not happen when the official Twitter profile of a cricket board of a country is tweeted in the language of another country
 duusare desh kii bhashaa chhodie, bhartiya cricket board (bisisiai) ne to aaj tak shaayad hi kabhi hindi main twit kiya ho
 But the language of cricket is global and it knows the ECB
 in dinon bhartiya cricket timengland ke daure par he
 The test match is being played at the Trent Bridge ground in Nottingham
 match ke pal-pal kaa haal bisisiai or isibi ke twitor profile par bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 In this sequence, the ECB first tweeted in English and asked its followers to give feedback on today's program at Trent Bridge
 is twit ke saath ek tasviir bhi thi jisamen baayin taraf cheteshwar pujaara kii photo thi or daayin taraf stuart broad kii
 England Cricket Board's next tweet was in Hindi

 “aapako sunai detaa he? neeche aaie bhaiya
 “humid day in Bhagalpur in eastern Bihar
 dopaher ke 1
 It is 35 pm and Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived here by two hours late
 lekin bheed main baari utsaah he
 To see Modi, some youth climbed on the bamboo bullets on which the stage tent rests
 yah dekhakar modi ne un yuvaaon se aagrah kiya, “aapako sunai detaa he? neeche aaie
 People gathered around this rally held on 1 September at the commonly used airbase of Bhagalpur
 modi ne bhale hi apane chunavi vaade puure na kiye hon
 Opponents say that not a single promise has been fulfilled
 lekin jamini str par unhone logon ke saath jo khaas rishta kaayam kiya he, vah bhi unki us hytech mashinari jitna hi mahatvapurn he jiske kandhon par unke sandesh ko bihar kii gali-gali tak pahunchane kii jimmedaari he
 Modi, the important face of the BJP, was once again doing what he has been doing for the last few years & deciding the election agenda and the topic of discussion, whether it is political or personal
 unhone pichley paanch hafton main bihar main chaar “parivartan” reliyaan kii hai
 His first rally was held in Muzaffarpur on 25 July and every rally was bigger than the previous rally
 in sabhi ke jariye ve ek baar phir puure chunaav ko apane ird-gird kendrit karne main kaamyaab rahe
 This includes his achievements, his perceived failures, his model of good governance and his development agenda
 ve apane adhure vaadon ke baavjood ek baar phir apni lokapriyata par muhar lagavane main kaamyaab rahe hai or akele apane dam par bijepi ko bihar main jeet dilaane kii khatir party ke abhiyaan kaa cheharaa ban gaye hai
 It is clear that Narendra Modi has set the agenda for the Bihar election in due course
 jis chhapamar style main ve apni chunavi sabhaayen kar rahe hai, vah unki suniyojit ranneeti kii gavaahi detii he
 They give one point to their opponents and immediately bounce another to the next assembly
 iske chalate unke virodhiyon ke paas jawaab dene kaa mauka hi nahin rah jaataa
 If they answer one, then another issue arises
 bhagalpur kii raily ke baad yah saaf ho gaya ki “daago or bhaago” kii modi kii yah ranneeti kaaphi sochi-samajhi he
 In the beginning of his campaign in Bihar, Modi directly attacked his two political rivals, Nitish Kumar of JD (U) and Lalu Prasad Yadav of RJD, and exposed their contradictions at two meetings of Muzaffarpur and Gaya on 9 August
 lalu or nitish jaise hi unki style main jawaab dene lage, modi ne sari bahes ko palatate hue 18 agast ko aara main apni teesri sabha main bihar ko sava lakh karod ru
 Announced the development package of
 yani aarope-pratyarope kii ladaai main funsane se unhone inkaar kar diya
 The reason for the BJP to be happy is that their opponents were making mistakes every time they came under their provocation
 duusari ore lalu se zyada bada daanv nitish kumaar kaa laga he isliye pradhanmantri ke package ke jawaab main nitish ne sarkari kharch se akhabaaron main puure pannon kaa vigyaapan jari karavaaya or pradhanmantri ke vishesh package ke badale main bihar ke vikaas ke liye apni ore se 2
 7 lakh crore Rs
 ke package kaa elaan kiya
 He might have thought that Modi would get into a debate with him on this, but on the contrary Modi welcomed the package and said, "it is good that development has become an electoral issue now
" ” iske peeche saaf taur par unki soch yahi thi ki logon tak yah sandesh jaae ki modi ne hi apane virodhiyon ko vikaas par kendrit hone ke liye majaboor kiya he
 Although Modi cleverly ignored questions related to his work as Prime Minister, he realizes that his report card in the last 14 months is not as bright as it was when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat before the last general elections
 modi yah bhi jaanate hai ki ve apane upar ho rahe tamaam hamalon ko nazarandaaj kar sakate hai, lekin kaamkaaj ke masale par ho rahi apni aalochanaon ko unhen shant karnaa hi hoga
 He did exactly this at Bhagalpur rally
 unhone kaha ki ve apane kaamkaaj kaa lekha-jokha to 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke vakt denge, lekin “yah mauka to unke (lalu or nitish) ke liye he ki ve apane 25 varshon ke raaj kaa hisaab den
 Instead of telling what they did during this time, both of them are being done only Modi, Modi
 ”nitish or lalu ko ek saath rakhkar unase 25 saal kaa hisaab maangana bhi ek suniyojit ranneeti kaa hi hissaa he
 It deliberately forgets the fact that the BJP itself was part of the Nitish government during these years for eight years
 bijepi achche se samajhati he ki nitish ko vikaas ke mudde par chunauti nahin di ja sakati kyonki unhone bihar main kuch to kiya hi he
 a senior BJP leader says, “the matter is clear
 nitish ko lalu prasad ke vot bank kaa laabh milane kii ummid he, to unhen lalu ke kushasan kaa hissedaar bhi bananaa hi hoga
 Both cannot break away from Jangraj's legacy
 ” nitish kumaar ne ab tak lalu prasad ke 15 saal ke kushasan kaa jawaab nahin diya he lekin bijepi ne tay kiya he ki vah unase lagaataar yah sawaal poochhegi
 Modi is trying another old recipe: if you can't beat them, ignore them
 patna ke aitihaasik gandhi maidan main 30 agast ko sonia gandhi, nitish or lalu kii sanyukt raily main modi par jamkar nishane saadhe gaye the
 On her "56-inch chest" statement, Sonia Gandhi asked, "what has Modi done other than Shobaji (gimmick)?" So Nitish said, "he is the one to challenge the DNA of Biharis whose ancestors had no role in the freedom struggle
" ” lalu ne to vyaktigat hamalaa bolte hue unki jativaadee apil kaa bhi majaak udaaya lekin modi ne in sabhi tippaniyon kii sahaj upeksha kar di
 In this way, Modi is trying to establish himself among the people by rising above such things as a big personality
 unhone sidhe naam lekar aarope lagane kii apni vah galati sudhaar lee jo dilli main un par baari padi thi or jiskaa phayda yahaan unke pratidwandvi arvind kejariwal ko mil gaya tha
 In contrast, on 25 July, when Modi questioned the state chief minister's DNA at his rally "due to being stabbed in the back of friends", Nitish campaigned to force him to "take back his words"
 unhone jedy(you) kaaryakartaaon se paanch karod bihariyon ke nakhun or baalo ke namoonay lene ko kaha jinhen pradhanmantri karyaalay main diene test ke liye bheja ja sake
 To remind of the unfinished promises of the Prime Minister, Nitish Kumar also played a record of the speeches made during Modi's Lok Sabha election campaign in his public meetings, but he has not yet been able to persuade Modi to answer them
 bihar bijepi ke ek netaa kehete hai, “ham nitish or lalu ke liye nahin, matadaataaon ke liye prachaar kar rahe hai
 By not responding to their allegations, we have snatched away the opportunity to set an election agenda from them and frustrated them
 ”darasal, modi ne gathbandhan sahyogiyon ramvilas paswan, jithan ram maanjhi or upendra kushvaha ko jati kaa card khilne kii puri chhot di he, lekin khud jati se upar uthakar mahilaon or yuvaaon ko lubhaane kaa kaam kar rahe hai jinke bich unke chaahane waalon kii badi taadaad bihar main he
 The election of Bihar is very decisive
 yahaan bijepi kaa acha pradarshan dilli ke daag ko dho daalega
 More important than this is that this will also set the backdrop for the next elections to be held in West Bengal in the east of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in the west
 donon rajyon main 2017 main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 There is a do or die situation for Nitish in this election
 modi ke liye yah unki saakh kaa sawaal he, jo jeetne par badhegi jabaki haarane par yah ho saktaa he ki bhagalpur ke ve yuva modi kii jhalak paane ke liye balliyon par chadhgaye kaa ksht nahin uthaaenge, kam se kam nikat bhavishya main to nahin hi

 When a fire of violence erupts in any state of the Northeast, it is natural for the country to be worried
 aise main puure maamle kii gaharaai se padtaal jaruri ho jaati he
 In fact, indefinite curfew was imposed in Manipur's Churchandpur to control law and order after violence erupted on Monday night

 The violent mob also included members of the Tribal Students Organization, who were opposing 3 important Bills passed by the Manipur government
 halaat behad tanaavpurn hai
 These are the controversial 3 bills
 There is a ruckus in the state on 3 bills passed in the Manipur Assembly
 teenon vidheyak somvaar ko vidhansabha main sarvasammati se paarit kar die gaye
 Here are the bills
 
 
 1
 Manipur Public Protection Bill 20152
 manipur bhu-rajasav va bhoomi sudhaar (saatvaan sanshodhan) vidheyak, 20153
 Manipur Shops and Establishments (second Amendment) Bill, 2015 All three bills have been passed for the protection of local people in Manipur for the purpose of protecting the interests of local residents
 isse pehle sattarudh congress ne 25 agast ko inner line permit system (JCILPS) ke liye sanyukt samiti ke saath samjhaute par hastakshar kiye the, taaki in teen kanoonon se rajya ke mul nivaasiyon ke hiton kii suraksha sunishchit kii ja sake
 JCILPS has been performing for the last 3 years to get its demands made
 is sanghathan kaa kahana he ki manipur main bahari logon kii taadaad lagaataar bad rahi he
 The organization says that outsiders are taking the land and jobs of the original inhabitants
 kyon ho rahaa he vironmanipur ke janajaatiy samooh rajya vidhansabha main paarit teen vidheyakon kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 He says that these bills violate some important points of the Manipur Hill People Administration Regulation Act, 1947, which was created to protect the interests of the tribal people who settled in the mountainous regions of Manipur
 tanaav kii mul vajahanaya kanoon banane kii maang manipur ke bahusankhyak miti samudaay ne kii thi
 Tribal groups are opposing this
 adivaasiyon ko ashanka he ki unhen nae kanoon kaa khamiaja bhugatna pad saktaa he
 It is a different matter that after the new law is enacted, it will be necessary for people coming to Manipur from outside states to get a permit
 nae kanoon kaa kya hoga asarane kanoon ke mutabik, manipur main jo log 1951 se pehle based hue hai, unhen hi sampatti par haq hoga
 Those who have settled after 1951, such people will have no right over the property
 itnaa hi nahin, un logon ko manipur se baahar kaa bhi rasta dikhaaya ja saktaa he
 This is the reason that many student organizations are opposing the bill governing the entry, residence and rights of outsiders in the state
 kya he inner line permit (ilp)inner line permit (ILP) bharat sarkaar kii ore jari kiya jane waal vah dastavej he, jo ek simit avadhi ke liye ek sangrakshit yaa pratibandhit kshetra main ek bhartiya naagarik kii yatra kii anumati detaa he
 This document is mandatory for Indian nationals from outside those states to enter a secure state
 yah arunachal pradesh, nagaland or mizoram main entry ke liye anivaary he
 It was implemented in the British period
 1950 main manipur kshetra main ise nirast kar diya gaya
 The demand to implement ILP in Manipur arose in 1980
 kareeb 30 sanghathan JCILPS bana kar andolan kar rahe hai

 Former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar strongly condemned the skirmish between India and Sri Lankan cricketers on the field and said such incidents were not good for the game
 chandimal or dhammika se bhide eshanthgauratlab he ki bhartiya tej gendbaaj eshanth sharma kii tisare test ke chauthe din srilanka ke dhammika prasad or dinesh chandimal ke saath jhadap hui thi jabaki tisare din bhi wo rangana herath or kushal perera se bhid gaye the

 bachche dekh rahe hai or international player role model hote hai
 This is the only game to be enjoyed
 aap nahin chaahate ki mata pita apane bacchon se kahen ki unhen khel nahin khelnaa chahie
 Ishant bowled brilliantly, although Gavaskar looked very impressed with Ishant's bowling
 unhone kaha, 'usne jaandaar pradarshan kiya
 His wrist position was good and he was making good use of the seam
 aisa lag rahaa tha jaise ki baahar kii taraf nikal rahi gend andar aa jaaegi
 This is good news for Indian cricket
 yadi vah apane gusse par niyantran banaaye rakhata he to phir yah team ke liye acha he
 'gavaskar's advice to Binny also gave advice to Stuart Binny
 unhone kaha, 'rohit sharma ke saath uski saajhedaari se pari ko majbootee mili
 He played as he plays
 yadi vah hawa main shot maarane main bare main sochna band kar de to acha hoga
 He should play his shots but sticking to the ground
 'nichle kram se prabhavit hai gavaskaryah purv captain nichle kram ke ballebaajon ke pradarshan se bhi prabhavit dikhaa
 Gavaskar said, 'this is fantastic
 yah dekhakar acha laga ki unhone jajba dikhaaya
 This requires commitment

 Make it difficult for the opposing team to take wickets
 'nai gend se hui acchhee gendbaajidonon tiimon ke salaami ballebaajon ko siries main ran banane ke liye jujhna padaa

 input language bhartiya vayusena apane bede main sukhoi-30 ko or adhik jodne kii icchhuk nahin he
 Recently Russia offered 40 Sukhoi-30 combat aircraft to India, but it seems that the Air Force is not keen on it
 vayusena ke paas pehle se hi 220 sukhoi-30 hai or 2020 tak ye sankhya 272 ho jaaegi
 Government sources told Mail Today that Russia had offered to give 40 more planes to India along with HAL, but the Air Force is not interested in it due to the high price and long-term maintenance
 vayusena ko lagata he ki sukhoi-30 kii uske paas paryaapt sankhya he, jisamen adhik haivi wet catagori ke hai
 It is being told that the price of Sukhoi-30 is one third of the price of Rafale 36 of France
 lekin sukhoi kaa mentanence uski asal keemat kaa teen guna ho jaataa he
 Several orders of the Russian Sukhoi, which belonged to the medium weight category, were given by the previous government
 gauratlab he ki vayusena ke paas kul 42 scwarden main se abhi 12 kii kami he
 In such a situation, the need of arms is constant
 abhi haal hi main hui gaganshakti eksrasise ke dauraan sukhoi bhi shaamil tha
 But the maintenance price of these Russian aircraft was very high
 jo ki ek dikkat kaa sabab he
 It is being told that if the Air Force does not take these Sukhoi-30s, then they can be replaced by F-16, F-18 of America and mig 35 of Russia or Swedish Gripen
 mail today kii puri khabar yahaan padhein

 It is worth noting that Afridi has tasted victory for the team due to unilateral performance in all the three matches of Cricket Mahakumbh
 afridi ne ab tak toornament main 14 wicket liye hai or vah do baar main aaf da match rahe
 In the Group b match against New Zealand on Tuesday, the former Misbah has asked his team to try to ease the current pressure on Afridi
 misabah ne kaha, ‘yah team ke liye bahut acchhee baat he ki uskaa captain acha pradarshan kar rahaa he lekin anya khilaadiyon ko bhi acha pradarshan karne kii jarurat he
 Take responsibility and reduce the pressure on the captain
 ’unhone kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki sabhi paristhitiyon main, khaskar yahaan, afridi ko khelnaa kaaphi mushkil he, uske paas vividhta he or vah ballebaajon ko samay nahin detaa he
 He has led the team with such passion
 ’newjiland ke gendbaajon ke nishane par hone sambandhi sawaal ke jawaab main misabah ne kaha, ‘ve mujhe lakshya nahin bana sakate kyonki mujhase pehle teen yaa chaar ballebaaj hai jo saikadaa laga sakate hai

 But Justice Markandey Katju, former Supreme Court Justice and former Chairman of Press Council of India, has mocked Bihar over Kashmir
 unhone kashmir ko lekar twitor or fasebuk par vivaadit tippanee kii he
 Katju has written on his Facebook page that there is an offer for Pakistan, if he wants Kashmir, Bihar will have to take along with him
 katju ke is tarah ke vivaadit bol par bihar ke raajnneetik dalon main kaaphi aakrosh he
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar expressed strong displeasure over Katju's statement
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki kya katju bihar ke maai-baap hai
 Bihar has a glorious history and how can anyone say such
 bihar main shaam kaise kategi isko lekar kuch log baichaiyn hai
 Katju again in controversies, Katju is often in controversies about his comments
 is baar unhone kashmir ko lekar tippanee kii he, unhonetwitor or fasebukapar likhaa he ki pakistan ke log aaie or kashmir vivaad ko milakar khatm karte hai
 He has further written that on one condition we will give you Kashmir, you will have to take Bihar along with it
 ye ek package deal he
 
 
 Either or both, otherwise nothing
 ham aapako keval kashmir nahin denge
 Accepted? Not all-round condemnation on social media, Katju further wrote that former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee had also offered this to the then President of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf during the Agra talks, but the fool Musharraf turned down
 is tarah ke apadats ke baad soshal media parkatjuki chautarafa ninda ho rahi he
 All the people are commenting against him
 kuch log ne katju dwaara purv pradhanmantri vaajapeyi kaa naam lene kadi pratikriya di he
 Heavy resentment among the people of Bihar in the mindset of wrong thinking about Bihar came out in another statement on Katju's Facebook
 katju ne post main apane professor kii baat kaa zikr karte hue likhaa he ki unhone padhai ke dauraan bataaya tha ki hindustan ko khatra pakistan se nahin balki bihar se he
 Once Firaq Gorakhpuri, my English teacher in Allahabad University, said 2 me "hindustan ko khatra Pakistan se nahin hai, Bihar se hai"
 — Markandey Katju (@mkatju)september 26, 2016baat badhane par bataaya majaakaaalanki maamla badhane ke baad katju ne apni safai ise sirf ek majaak bataaya he or logon kii kadi pratikriya ko sens of humar kii kami bataai he
 He said that it should only be taken as a joke
 jabaki tamaam log ise uri main hue shaheedon kaa apmaan bataa rahe hai or katju se maafee kii maang kar rahe hai
 Significantly, despite being the president of the Press Council of India, Katju had questioned the freedom of media in Bihar, at that time there was a lot of uproar
 jediu ne katju ke bayaan kaa kiya virohasupreme court ke purv justise markendeya katju ke is vivaadit post par bihar ke raajnneetik dalon main kaaphi aakrosh he
 JDU spokesperson Neeraj Kumar, while speaking on the disputed post of Katju said, "O Lord, forgive them!" JDU spokesperson Neeraj Kumar has said that Katju does not know what crimes he is committing
 swatantraaa andolan ke itihaas main bihar kaa avismaraneey yogadan rahaa he, saath hi saath gandhi ke champaran satyagrah se lekar saamaajik sadbhaav ke liye chale andolan main bihar kii ahm bhoomika rahi he
 In such a situation, the remark made by Justice Katju without knowing the heritage of Bihar is quite indecent
 raajnneetik dalon se bataaya ise bihar kaa apmaanavhin bijepi netaa nand kishor yadav ne pehle to justise katju ke tippanee ko tavajjo hi nahin di phir kaha kashmir ko lekar vivaadit bayaan dena kisi bhi haalat main sweekaarya nahin he or kashmir ke saath bihar kaa naam jodna bihar kaa apmaan karnaa he
 Bihar will not forgive Katju under any circumstances for this

 To hide their shortage, some people of the government are targeting the officers
 ab to mere bachche or rishtedaar bhi mujhe andeh bhari najaron se dekhne lage hai
 The IAS Association is dead in the state, in such a situation, the silence of the Chief Secretary is dropping the morale of the officers
 ''uttar pradesh sachivalay main tainaat sachiv str ke ek iees adhikari kii mukhya sachiv javed osmani par kii gai yah tippanee yah bataane ke liye kaaphi he ki nai sarkaar banane ke baad bhi pradesh main naukarshahi kaa mukhiya vah ikbaal nahin kaayam kar paaya jisaki ummid kii ja rahi thi
 Why were there expectations from the post of Chief Secretary? To know the answer to this question, one has to walk a bit backward
 pichley paanch varsh ke dauraan mayawati ke kaarykaal main mukhya sachiv ko babu jaisaa bana diya gaya tha, jabaki vah rajya afasarshahi kii sabase badi sanstha thi
 During her reign, Mayawati made the post of Cabinet Secretary over the entire bureaucracy and placed her favorite non-ias officer and Pilot Shashank Shekhar Singh on it
 us samay mukhya sachiv kaa kaam keval pancham tal (sachivalay ke paanchave tal par maujuud mukhyamantri karyaalay kaa prachlit naam) par baithe cabinet sachiv ke adeshon kii taamil karnaa hi rah gaya tha
 As soon as the Nizam changed, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav abolished the post of Cabinet Secretary and made the Chief Secretary the head of the bureaucracy
 akhilesh ne muslim card khelte hue 1978 batch ke iees or centre main pratiniyukti par tainaat afasar javed osmani ko nayaa mukhya sachiv banaaya, jo mulaayam singh kii pichhali sapa sarkaar main sachiv or pramukh sachiv pad par rah chuke the
 Two weeks after Usmani's deployment, clashes started in the fifth floor and the Chief Secretary's office in matters of appointment to policy and important posts and due to this conflict many appointments made at the Principal Secretary level had to be reshuffled soon after deployment
 ab alam yah he ki rajya main mulaayam singh ke kareebi sevanivrutt iees afasar pratyaksh evam paroksh rup se naukarshahi par prabhavi bane hue hai or mukhya sachiv ko khulkar kaam karne kaa mauka nahin mil paa rahaa
 "the officers in the SP government are unbridled," says Nasimuddin Siddiqui, the national general secretary of the opposition BSP and the leader of the party in the Legislative Council
 jis tarah sarkaar main ek nahin balki 3-4 mukhyamantri hai, usee prakaar naukarshahi main do-teen mukhya sachiv hai
 By making Usmani the chief secretary, the SP government has tried to woo only Muslims, which is not going to succeed
 ''lag rahaa he ki osmani kii bhi mukhya sachiv bane rahane main koi ruchi nahin he or jald hi unki vaapasi ho sakati he
 Irrespective of the criticisms, Usmani is monitoring the Chief Minister's ambitious plans such as unemployment allowance or laptops to students
 mukhya sachiv banane ke baad javed osmani kaa zyaadaatar samay apane karyaalay main baithkon or filon ko nipataane main hi biit rahaa he
 Akhand Pratap Singh and Naveen Chandra Vajpayee, who were the chief secretaries in the previous SP government, used to inform the media about its decisions after every cabinet meeting, but Usmani has put an end to this tradition
 raajnneetik vishleshak surendra singh kehete hai, ''beete 20 varshon ke dauraan osmani zyaadaatar piemo main hi tainaat rahe or is kaaran unpar baithkon kii kaarysamskruti haaavee he
 If they keep sitting in the office and beating only the file, then the state land will not be able to deal with the reality
 jo sarkaar ke liye phydemand nahin hoga
 Javed Usmani's visit to the US to visit his family on a three-week long leave (july 24 to August 12) after his deployment has also led to criticism
 congress vidhanmandal dal ke netaa pradeep maathur kehete hai ki yah vah samay tha jab pradesh bheeshan bijli sankat tha, ahm tabadale ho rahe the, purvi jilon kii nadiyon kaa jalastr bad rahaa tha
 There was also communal tension in many districts, the Chief Secretary going on leave amid such circumstances raises questions on his functioning

 The writer Mahesh Katare, while exploring history, folklore, research, etc
, has created a classic, in the form of the novel Kamini Kya Kantare
 upanyaas kii sabase mahatvapurn baat he isaki bhashaa, iskaa pravaah, jo bhartruhari ke samay, kaal ko jivit kar detii he
 Creating an environment so that there is a graphical representation of the language

 In this novel, along with Bhartrihari, there are interludes like Kiral Katha, urvashi-pururava Katha, Guru Gorakhnath Janma Katha etc
 yah upanyaas hindi sahitya ko na keval samrudh karata he, balki manushya ke, shram ke paksh main khadaa ho uske jhande fahraata he
 In the entire novel, there are his episodes when the novelist has distinguished labor, humanism against wealth, wealth and consumerism and it does not seem to be a success
 jahaan kahin bhi yah kamjor hua, vah ise rekhaankit kar detaa he
 Bhartrihari stayed away from the people as long as the king, when he himself came to the people, settled in the folk-mind, in folklore

 Virat Kohli said on Wednesday that it was too early to decide on his captaincy, but insisted that he had become a better batsman after getting the role of the leader, as there is no room for complacency due to the captaincy
 apni captaini ke kisi bhi moolyankan se inkaar karte hue kohli ne kaha ki captain utana hi acha hota he, jitani acchhee uski team hoti he
 Before the first Test match against Australia starting on Thursday, Kohli said, 'I don't evaluate my captaincy after every series
 hamaari praathamikta or ekmaatr lakshya cricket match jeetna he
 Captaincy is as good as how your team is performing and how much consistency there is in the players' performance
 agar ham khilaadi ke rup main apni kshamta ke anusaar nahin khel rahe to ek captain ke rup main main kaaphi kuch nahin kar saktaa
 ' unhone kaha, 'team jitani adhik paripakv banegi captain utana acha lagane lagegaa
 If the team does not perform well then the captaincy will start to look somewhat uncontrolled
 shaayad paanch se aath saal baad main captain ke rup main apana moolyankan kar paaungaa, agar main itane samay tak captain rahaa to
 i think it is too early for me to sit down and evaluate whether i have done well or not
 ' Kohli, who has done well in recent times as a batsman and captain, said that batting becomes a more serious task when he is the leader of the team
 kohli ne kaha, 'captaini aapako kisi bhi samay atmamugdh nahin hone detii visheshkar jab balla aapke haath main ho or aap sirf yahi karte hon
 From this aspect, i feel that self-immolation does not have a place in captaincy
 ' bhartiya captain ne kaha ki unke australian samakaksh steve smith ke maamle main bhi yah baat sahi he

 afghanistan secular desh tha, lekin is par jaldi hi kattarpathiyon kaa kabja ho gaya or unhone sabase pehle alpsankhyakon ko nishaanaa banaaya
 Their religious freedom was taken away, religious places demolished, even Hindus and Sikhs had to flee from there
 "unhone kaha, "mujhe ummid he ki naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak 2019 ko sansad dwaara paas kiye jane ke baad, pakistan, afghanistan or bangladesh main rahane vaale tamaam hindu or sikh samudaay ke log khushi se bharat aaenge or yahaan basenge
 "harinder Singh who came to India from Afghanistan is also among those who came to India from Afghanistan in 1989

 The radicals in Afghanistan used to tell us that you go to India, Afghanistan is not your country
 jab hamaare pariwaron par hamale hone lage to uske baad ham sabane us desh ko chhodane or bharat main palaayan karne kaa faisla kiya
 "the family of Hindu Sikh Welfare Society President Tajinder Singh Khurana also left Afghanistan in 1980 and they came to India
 ve hindu or sikh apravasiyon ke liye naagarikta ke adhikaar kii ladaai ladate rahe hai
 He said, "life has become very difficult for those who left Afghanistan
 bahut se log bina kanoonee dastavej, bina vija, bina passport ke aae the
 We could not move from one place to another, there was no employment for us
 bahut se hinduon or sikhon ko afghanistan se germany, landan or france bhej diya gaya tha or kuch bharat aa gaye the
 "recalling the period of terror against the minorities in Afghanistan, they say that we came here avoiding all the attacks

 We will get citizenship of a country

 The history of Bollywood is a witness that whenever love story based films are made in Hindi cinema, they have got a lot of love from the audience
 1960 main bani mughal-e-ajam ho, 1957 main pyaasa, 1976 main kabhi kabhi, 1989 main maine pyaar kiya, 1995 main dilavaale dulhaniya le jaaenge jaisi saikadon filmein is baat kii gavaah hai
 However, all of Bollywood's love stories show the positive side of love
 haalanki dar, anjaam or tere naam jaisi kai prem kahaniyaan aisi bhi hai jinamein pyaar kaa junun or ek alag tarah kii nakaaratmakataa dikhaai detii he
 When explained in a straight language, there are two types of lovers in Bollywood films
 ek wo jo pyaar main qurbaani dena jaanata he
 The second one who wants to sacrifice to get love

 aisi tamaam filmon main pyaar kaa junun dikhataa he
 Shahid Kapoor's Kabir Singh comes in the category of similar films
 kabir singh main kabir, priti sikaa ke pyaar main he, jise wo apni bandi kahata he
 Breaks college rules to take care of him
 logon ko jaanwaron kii tarah peethta he
 When it comes to marriage, the world fights with the world to find love there too
 jab pataa chalata he ki priti kii shaadi ho gai, wo maa banane vaali he phir bhi wo bas priti ko chahta he
 Kabir Singh has many evils, he is not a responsible student
 jimmedaar betaa nahin he, jimmedaar bhai nahin he
 Drinks and drinks alcohol
 tuutakar nashe karata he
 But she has a lot of love for Preity
 bollywood main pichley kuch saalon main prem kahaniyaan ai hai
 These include films like Sultan
 meri shaadi main jarur aana he, jiro he or photograph bhi he
 But in these stories, the passion shown for love seems very mature and cold
 kahana galat nahin hoga ki pichley kuch saalon main college life kii aisi koi kahani dekhne ko nahin mili hai jisamen nayak, nayika ko duubakar pyaar karata he
 a hero who is careless to the heroine
 duniya jahaan ko thenge par rakhata he

 Film Name: Trapped Director: Vikramaditya Motwanistar Cast: Rajkumar Rao, Geetanjali Thapa Duration: 1 hour 42 minutes Certificates: u / a Rating: 3
 5 stardiarector vikramaditya motwani ne 'looteraa' or 'udaan' jaisi behtareen filmon kaa diarection kiya he saath hi 'phantum' film ke binar tale kai filmein produs bhi kii hai or ab ek baar phir se vikramaditya ne alag tarah ke subject par kaam karke film banaai he, jisamen unhone behtareen actors main se ekarajkumaar raav ko liya he,kisi bani he yah film, iskaa pataa lagane ke liye aai samiksha karte hai
 Kahani This story is of Shaurya (rajkumar Rao), a resident of Mumbai, who works in an office and leaves his bachelor pad to spend a life with office girl Noori (geetanjali Thapa) but sets out to find a new home
 Gets stuck in the circle of the new house
 ek ban rahi building main brokar use jhansa dekar ghar de detaa he or phir shuru ho jaati he kahani
 In a house where there is neither water nor electricity, you will have to watch the film to find out how Shaurya fights to get out of that building
 jaaniye aakhir film ko kyon dekh sakate henfilm rajkumaar raav kii behtareen parformens aapako harek pal main us kirdaar ke bare main sochane ke liye vivash karti he or aap uske bheetar chal rahe imoshans se conect kar pate hai
 If you keep watching the same actor on screen for 102 minutes, then there is boredom somewhere but Rajkumar has done a wonderful job according to his performance which keeps you hooked and also makes you think
 -film kaa plot kaaphi simpal rakhaa gaya he jo kii dekhne main free flo najar aata he
 - This film is free from Bevajah's songs, because of which you do not see any hindrance while watching, or you do not go outside the theater on an unwanted break
 -film bina interval ke relies kii gai he jisaki vajah se aap kahani ke jone main bane rahete hai
 - The film's cinematography is good and the location is amazing
 -film dekhte vakt ye yakeen ho jaataa he kii sains main padhaayaa gaya lamark or darwin kaa niyam kitna sahi he
 Weak Links: The weak link of the film is its rupture which could have been shortened, as well as there are some long and long scenes which are fine according to the film festivals, but nowadays people of Bhag Rani's era may want quick results, then the film Perhaps the stagnation in it may become its minus point
 tipical hindi filmon kii tarah kirdaaron ko zyada sajaayaa dhajaya nahin gaya he or saath hi wo masala, kamedi yaa item numbers nahin hai, jo kii aajkal ke filmon main istemaal kiye jate hai, jisaki vajah se shaayad ek tapaka is film se ittefaq naa rakh paae
 At the box office, the shooting of the film was completed in an apartment in Mumbai within 25 days and the budget is very low and it will be easy to recover after the release if the film's digital and overseas are included

 As usual, Kapil Sharma once again gave up in front of Sania's spot reply

 But now someone has become a mother, someone has become a daughter

 On hearing this, Kapil Sharma was seen blushing

 So what does Shoaib brother do

 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ne aarope lagaaya ki congress nit samprag sarkaar desh kii ab tak kii sabase ‘bhrasht’ or ‘kamjor’ sarkaar he
 Addressing an election rally organized in support of BJP candidate UT Jayanathan from Kannur assembly seat, Advani alleged that the UPA government is steeped in corruption and is the most corrupt and weak government in the country so far
 unhone 2ji spectrum, rashtramandal khel or adarsh flats ghotaalon kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki pratidin ek ke baad ek bhrashtachar ke maamle saamne aat hi ja rahe hai
 He expressed confidence that the BJP will represent the Kerala Legislative Assembly this time as the public is fed up with both LDF and UDF
 unhone kaha ki rajya ke vikaas or pragati main pichhadane ke liye congress ke samarthan se bani makapa nit ldf or udief kii vaikalpik sarkarein hi jimmedaar hai
 He claimed that the people of Kerala have started considering a third option
 2017 punjab vidhansabha chunaavon main ab tak jis netaa ne sabase zyada surkhiyaan batori hai, wo hai navjot singh siddhu
 63-year-old Sidhu was born in Patiala, Punjab and his father was a Congressman
 bijepi se apana saalon purana naata todane ke baad siddhu apni nai raajnneetik pari kis party ke saath shuru karenge
 
 
 This has been a big question
 pehle mana ja rahaa tha ki punjab vidhansabha chunaav main siddhu aam aadmi party ke saath khadey najar aaenge, lekin kisi kaaran aap ke saath unki baat nahin bani
 After this, Sidhu appeared in the struggle to form his own party, but putting an end to all the speculation, he finally started his new political innings with the Congress party
 siddhu punjab kii amritsar seat se 10 saalon tak bhaajapa ke saansad rahe, lekin 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main party ne unki bajaay arun jetali ko maidan main utaara
 It is believed that the dispute between Sidhu and the BJP started from here
 aapako bataa den ki siddhu se pehle unki patni navjot cor siddhu ne bhaajapa se naata todaa tha or congress main shaamil ho gai thim
 However, she is not contesting any seat in the 2017 Punjab elections
 vahiin, siddhu congress ke tikat se amritsar (east) nirvachan kshetra se chunavi medaan main utre
 The Samajwadi Party is recovering after the defeat in UP
 nae adhyaksh party kii parampara ko aage badha rahe hai
 He is going to give an iftar party soon
 party ke bataur adhyaksh yah unki pehali iftaar party hogi
 Till now Mulayam used to give Iftar
 taiyaariyaan joro par hai
 But the biggest question is, will Mulayam himself join Akhilesh's party after the family dispute during the election? Mulayam's Iftar party Mulayam formed SP in 1992
 iske baad unhone rajya ke alpsankhyakon ko ekajute kiya
 After the Yadavas of UP, Muslim majority votes have played a major role in forming the SP government
 aise main mulaayam kii iftaar partiyon main chote-bade sab shirkat karte dikhe hai
 Will not join Shivpalamoolayam or not? Currently no party leader is ready to speak about it
 par yah saaf ho gaya he ki akhilesh yadav ke chachaa yani shivpal yadav nahin pahunch rahe hai
 Please tell that Mulayam is currently the party's mentor
 shivpal pichley saal oktober se hi naaraaz chal rahe hai
 His debate on stage with Akhilesh in front of Mulayam has been seen during the election
 aise main pehle se hi ye sambhaavna thi ki vah akhilesh ke saath shaayad hi aisi kisi party main najar aaen
 How will sp's Iftar Party? Preparations for Iftar are in full swing at the party's office in Lucknow
 bade-bade pandal lagaae ja rahe hai yahaan tak kii kalidas maarg ke baahar steel freming ke bade tent lagaae gaye hai, taaki shirkat karne vaale hajaaron log isamen shaamil ho sake
 The presence of many small and big leaders is expected from the party's biggest Muslim face Azam Khan
 raajnneetik siyasat ko party se rakhaa gaya doodhkhilesh yadav ne philhal iftaar party ko siyaasi jamaavade se dur rakhaa he
 This iftar is only kept for party people
 isamen kisi sarkari pad par yaa sanvaidhanik pad par asin logon ko nahin bulaayaa gaya
 In the past, parties also take care of the matter of which constitutional posts should be kept away from iftar
 akasar netaaon main aashaa or niraashaa kaa ajeebogareeb mail najar aata he
 When they are in public, they look hopeful, but in their personal moments are surrounded by despair
 jab bhi unki yathasthiti ko chunauti di jaati he or unhen apane kahe shabdon kii oot main sukun paane kii gunjaaish nahin dikhti, niraashaa kaa yah alam or gaharaa jaataa he
 The Congress is also not untouched by this
 ekadam nae avatar main aae iske netaa rahul gandhi kaa danaadan intervyuu dena or saarvajanik manchon par baar-baar aana, unke khud ke rajnatik ateet se ekadam ulat to he hi, unki party ke liye bhi yah nayaa anubhav he
 The effect of this is that they are constantly in the headlines and dominate the social media
 unki is kavayad ne kai logon kii neend uda di he
 The party's official stance on Rahul Gandhi's TV interview aired on Monday, 27 January, is that during the talks, his leader kept a heart-to-heart battle against Bharti Janata Party (BJP) Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi
 Made it
 yah to hui saarvajanik peshbandi, lekin nijee taur par sthiti ekadam ulat he
 24, the depth of khusra-phusar despair that is happening in the corridors of Akbar Road exposes the lines
 rahul ke yah maan lene se ki 1984 main unki daadi kii hatya ke baad hue ‘sikh virdohi dangon main sambhawatah kuch congressiyon kaa haath tha’, congress ke liye asahaj halaat paidaa ho gaye hai
 At the same time, there was a competition among the opposition parties to capitalize on this
 29 janvari ko rajdhani main bijepi vidhayakon ne congress ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan kiya
 On the same day, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal met Delhi Lieutenant Governor Najib Jung in a hurry and demanded a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the Sikh riots
 shiromani akali dal kii varshon se yahi maang he
 Congressmen are upset that Rahul's contract has brought the riots in Gujarat after the 2002 Godhra carnage against the 1984 riots
 apane bhaashanon main ‘bhrashtachar virdohi dhaanche’ kaa baar-baar zikr karne vaale rahul se yah puche jane par ki maharashtra ke purv mukhyamantri ashok chavaan or himachal ke maujuuda mukhyamantri virbhadra singh jaise congressiyon ke maamalon main ve kya karenge, to ve gol-mol jawaab dete najar aate hai
 a colleague who once worked on Rahul's media team says, "his interview has brought the old issue alive and brought it into the discussion
" us vakt agar ve khed jataate to bhi kuch nahin bigadataa, rahul badi aasaani se kah sakate the ki congress adhyaksh or pradhanmantri is maamle main pehle hi khed jataa chuke hai or ve bhi aisa hi kar rahe hai
 Although he was barely 12 years old at the time of the Sikh riots
 saath hi ve yah kahkar gujarat ke mukhyamantri ko kathghare main khadaa kar sakate the ki narendra modi bhedbhaav kii raajnneeti khelte hai or phir bhi unhen apane kiye par pachhtaawaa nahin hota
 He also said, "at the Youth Congress press conference in Amritsar in 2008, Rahul spoke more clearly
 ” 18 november, 2008 ko swarna mandir main mattha techne ke baad rahul ne amritsar main patrakaron se baatcheet ke dauraan 1984 ke sikh dangon ke bare main kaha thah “meraa maananaa he ki ye dange saraasar galat the
 Those who had a hand in these riots should be punished
 ” paanch saal se bhi adhik samay baad die gaye rahul ke is intervyuu main vah safagoi nahin jhalki
 Internally, there is a general consensus in the Congress that Rahul should have gone for that interview with more preparation - it is no small matter for the Congress
 soshal media main rahul ke bayaan par ubhari nakaaratmak tippaniyon ne congress ko hairaan kar diya he
 Many Congress leaders are avoiding it even
 party ko ummid thi ki rahul ke kuch samarthak or foloar to soshal media par kuch-na-kuch tippanee karenge hi or itane lambey-chaude intervyuu ke liye unki tarif hogi
 Congress leaders tweeted links to two old interviews of Modi when the Gujarat chief minister abruptly left the interview after being asked questions related to the 2002 riots
 phir bhi, soshal media par rahul kaa makhul udata rahaa
 The man associated with the elaborate management system of the people deployed with the aim of brightening Rahul's image admitted that the Prime Minister's team had prepared Rahul two days before the press conference
 unhen bhi or adhik abhyaas karnaa chahie tha
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had chalked himself up to more than 100 questions prepared by his team based on the facts from 28 ministries for his press conference
 vahiin, aisa lagata he ki rahul ne khud koi khaas mehnat nahin kii
 Rahul has said that the Congress party will win the elections, but has missed saying that if something similar is going to happen, what will be the concrete blueprint of UPA-3
 rahul ne apane intervyuu main “system” shabd kaa istemaal 70 se bhi adhik baar kiya jabaki “mahila shashaktikaran” kaa istemaal 18 ke aasapaas
 Talking about the system, he forgot that his party has been running the system for most of the time in the country
 congress ke liye rahul kii taiyaari main kami se bhi badi samasyaayein munh baae khadi hai
 The old stalwarts of the party are slowly accepting the reality of Sonia Gandhi's handing over the command to Rahul Gandhi in a phased manner
 lekin rahul ke is intervyuu se jis tarah unhen alag rakhaa gaya, usase party ke varisht netaa khafa ho gaye hai
 Even the advisors of the Congress President were not consulted
 lambey samay se rahul ke kareebi maane jane vaale ek netaa us samay hairaan rah gaye jab un tak is tarah kii charchaa pahunchi ki rahul kaa tivi ke liye intervyuu record kiya gaya he
 One leader says that “our workers are happy that their leaders are in the news, not Modi or Kejriwal
 anubhav ke saath ve behatar ho jaaenge
 "most people in Congress do not understand that Rahul had to do all this, so why did he not do it earlier?" This question arises in the minds of Congressmen as their Vice President openly admitted in the interview that their goals are clear and they have been working for them for years
 chunaav prachaar ke liye taiyaar congress ke vigyaapan main rahul ko ek aise super hero ke taur par pesh kiya gaya he jo logon kii sabhi samasyaayein khatm kar degaa, lekin aisa lagata he ki congress kaa yah netaa khud ko lekar hi duvidha kaa shikaar he kyonki sawaalon ke jawaab dene main vah atakane lagata he
 Congress leaders from Haryana say, "at the All India Congress Committee meeting held in Delhi on 17 January, Rahul appeared as an aggressive young leader, as if a general was preparing his army for war
 rahul ke pehle tivi intervyuu se kaaryakartaaon ko waisi hi ummid thi, lekin unhen isaki maamuli jhalak mili
 a source close to the developments related to this incarnation of Rahul said that there has been no change in the policy of keeping Rahul in the headlines
 media ko kahin adhik intervyuu dene or saarvajanik manchon par zyada se zyada maujuudagi sunishchit karne kii apni yojana par rahul ab bhi kaayam hai
 Along with this, he has made up his mind to continuously participate in the meetings with various class groups on the manifesto
 sutara aage bataata he, “ve aise eemaandaar yuva netaa ke taur par dikhte hai jin par aap bharosa kar sakate hai, unase darane kii koi vajah nahin
 It is clear from the interview that he is an human being
 ” beshak ek saamaanya insaan he to galati bhi karegaa
 But if this person is a leader and he does not even apologize for his mistake, then he may have to pay the price
 disambar kii shuruyaat se mahange honge telecom companiyon ke planceal hi main jeeyo ne bhi elaan kiya kiya ki company ke plance mahange hongesupreme court dwaara AGR bhugtan kaa faisla sarkaar ke paksh main die jane ke baad sabase pehle vodaphone idia ne apane mobile plance main disambar se badhotaree kiye jane kaa elaan kiya, uske kuch samay baad airtel ne bhi yahi ghoshnaa kii
 After these two companies, Jio also gave a shock to customers by making such an announcement
 rahi sahi kasar ek report ne puri kar di jisamen bataaya gaya ki BSNL bhi disambar se apane plance mahange karne ja rahaa he
 That is, all the big companies are going to make their mobile plans expensive from the beginning of December
 lekin abhi tak ye saaf nahin hua he ki keemton main kitni badhotaree kii jaaegi
 Now a report has come out, which describes how expensive the plans of private telecom companies can be
 Deccan Herald kii ek report ke mutabik, Airtel, Jio or Vodafone Idea ke graahakon ko bhavishya main saare richarge plance ke liye 20 pratishat tak zyada paisa dena pad saktaa he
 It has been reported in the report that different industry sources have confirmed that the prices of all recharge plans will probably be increased by up to 20 percent
 haalanki keemton main badhotaree richarge plance kii keemat par nirbhar karegi
 This means that there will be a slight increase in the prices of cheap recharge plans, while the prices of expensive recharge plans will increase by 20 percent
 report main kaha gaya he ki telecom companiyaan inkremental aadhaar par keemton main badhotaree karne kii yojana bana rahi hai
 The report also said that prepaid users will have more impact than postpaid users
 haalanki philhal ye conform nahin he
 That is, all the recharge plans of the telecom companies will get a uniform increase in the prices
 aise main jo log 100 rupee ke andar ke plance abhi upyog karte hai unhen kam prabhaav padegaa
 It will be interesting to see if there is any effect in the benefits of voice and data apart from prices

 Gazette notification of Singur Bill was issued to the West Bengal government's previous Left Front government to cancel the agreement with Tata Motors to return their land to the reluctant farmers
 pashchim bengal vidhansabha dwaara paarit singoor bhoomi punarvaas evam vikaas vidheyak-2011 ko rajyapal ke narayan ne apni sahmati pradaan kar di
 Official sources said a copy of the notification would soon be posted on the walls of the vacant project site of Tata Motors in Singur

 Amazon Prime Video isi mudde se prabhavit hokar ek web-siries laae hai jiskaa naam he Jack Ryan
 Originally the series is based on Tom Clancy's novel
 maatr 8 episod kii issirisko sitambar kii shuruyaat main release kiya gaya tha
 Which is available on Prime only
 kahani kya he
 
 ?jack Ryan american khufia agency CIA main bataur Analyst karyrat hai
 His understanding is so brilliant that his seniors use him in ground operations
 ISIS kaa sargana suleman america ke kuch vaigyanikon ko agava karata he or sharten rakhata he
 Jack has met him in France during a mission, so he puts some plan in front of the team, moves on the whole team on that plan
 jab ye kahani chal rahi hoti he tab Jack ko ek doctor se pyaar hota he, lekin wo bataata nahin he ki wo CIA kaa agent he
 Meanwhile, the CIA brings the Sultan's family to himself
 Jack ke plan par chalakar america apane nagarikon ko bachaa letaa he or suleman maaraa jaataa he
 Jack gets a promotion due to this success
 sijan ke ant main ek hook miltaa he jo bataata he ki aglaa sijan mishan rashia (rus) ho saktaa he
 Who are the main characters 
 ? Jack Ryan is played by John Krasinski, in addition to his girlfriend Doctor Cathy Mueller, played by Abbie Cornish
 baaki Wendell Pierce (CIA afasar), Ali Suleiman, Mousa Bin Suleiman ke kirdaar main hai
 How was the series? The issue of the series is very important but the way it is directed is very disappointing
 iske alaava Jack ke kirdaar main jon aapako achche nahin lagate hai
 According to the type of action and drama shown in the entire series, according to that, they are not able to bring an instance in John character
 sirf ection hi nahin balki romance ke samay main bhi wo aapako alag hi fez main dikhenge
 Wendell Pierce is very much into his character, before that you must have seen him in many seasons of Suits
 yahaan par bhi unka role or kaam damdaar hi rahaa he
 The rest of the characters are doing well at their respective places
 kya dekhnaa chahenge?aasaani se bataaya jaae to agar aapnesalmaan khanki tiger jinda he dekhi he to aap is siries ko nahin dekhnaa chahenge
 Because the way Salman single-handedly ends ISIS in his film, it is also shown here
 haalanki, fark itnaa he ki salmaan apane kirdaar main jach rahe hai, lekin John to Jack ke kirdaar ke saath ninsaphi kar karte najar aate hai
 What will happen next? It is not that the series is not good at all
 bich ke kuch aise episod aate hai jo aapako baandh kar rakhte hai
 But as soon as that pace starts to form, the season itself is over
 aglaa sijan bhi jald hi aa saktaa he
 Also this season mission will be based on Russia

 He said, the amount of money sent to Jammu and Kashmir in the last 35 years, if they were directly deposited in the account of citizens, then the people of Jammu and Kashmir would have become very rich
 modi ne logon ko bijepi ke liye matdaan karne kii apil karte hue kaha, sirf udhampur nahin, saare rajya main aashirwad den aapke sabhi sapane puure kar duungaa
 i became a hindrance for those who looted the public

 The party, which has only one MLA, handed over the letter of withdrawal of support from the government to the Governor on March 13, but party MLA and state cabinet minister Pritam Singh Pawar is against this decision
 is vakt loksabhaa chunaav ke muhane par khadi is party ke paas na to pratyaashee hai or na kaaryakarta
 The UKD won four seats in the state's first assembly election (2002), but never repeated it
 2007 main eukedy ko 3 or 2012 main keval ek seat mili
 Political analyst Dr
 giradhar pandit kehete hai, ''beshak uttarakhand andolan kii bagdor eukedy ke haath main rahi, lekin party sangharsh ko vot main nahin badal pai
 After the formation of the state, when the UKD was to strengthen the support base on issues, it became a puppet of governments
 eukedy 2002 main gathit congress sarkaar kaa hissaa nahin rahaa, lekin sarkaar ke khilaaf bhi khadaa nahin hua
 The UKD supported the BJP on 9 issues
 bhaajapa ne eukedy ko cabinet mantri kaa ek pad diya or yahi pad uske bikharane kaa kaaran bhi bana
 In December 2010, UKD withdrew support from the government but a faction led by cabinet minister Diwakar Bhatt remained with the government
 party do guton divakar bhatta-eukedy (di) or trivendra singh panvar—eukedy (pi) main bant gai
 The matter went to the National Election Commission and the Election Commission freeze the party's election symbol chair and did not allot this election symbol to any faction
 divakar gut ke donon vidhayakon divakar bhatta or omgopal ravat ne 2012 kaa vidhansabha chunaav bhaajapa ke chunaav chinh par ladaa, lekin donon haar gaye
 Whereas the Panwar faction managed to win only one seat from Yamunotri with the victory of Pritam Singh Panwar
 ab unhone bhi party kaa saath chhod diya he
 In 2012 the UKD joined the Congress Government
 vidhayak preetam singh panvar cabinet mantri bane lekin eukedy ne ek saal ke bheetar hi samarthan waapas le liya
 The UKD (P) organization met the governor and withdrew support to the Congress on 13 March 2013, but remained with the Pritam Singh government
 naaraaz eukedy (pi) adhyaksh trivendra singh panvar ne unhen party se nilambit kar diya
 Panwar says, "the decision to withdraw support was taken in the working committee, which Pritam Singh has been suspended for not accepting
" '' jabaki preetam singh kehete hai, ''adhyaksh (trivendra singh panvar) kaa kaarykaal 25 july, 2012 ko hi puraa ho chukaa he
 They are illegally occupying the party and office
 ''vahiin uttarakhand janatantric party adhyaksh or purv cabinet mantri divakar bhatta har haal main eukedy ke sabhi dhadon kaa vilay chaahate hai
 He says, "even if you separate me, unite UKD

 He says, "the party will run in solidarity, not dictatorship
" adhyaksh kaa kaarykaal khatm ho chukaa he
 But they are taking big decisions from their mind

 Chief Minister Kamal Nath's home district was also not left untouched by this list of sniffer dogs from Chhindwara
 siem kamalnath ke grih jile chhindwara se daphi naam ke snifer dog ko bhopal ke mukhyamantri awaas bheja gaya he
 After the transfer list of BJP attackers on transfers, the main opposition party Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has lashed out at the Congress government
 bhartiya janata party ke pradesh upaadhyaksh or bhopal ke hujur vidhansabha kshetra se vidhayak rameshwar sharma ne twit karte hue likhaa he ki 'hai re bedardi congress sarkaar kutto ko to chhod dete

 congress kii kamalnath sarkaar kaa vash chale or koi maal dene vaala mil jaae to wo jameen or aasmaan kaa swayan ke vyay par tabadalaa kar de
 'hi Ray, the Congress government would have abandoned the dogs

 Questioned the Congress decision to send Chidambaram to the Rajya Sabha
 shivasena ne kaha ki aisa karke congress maharashtra ke sir par jabaran chidambaram kaa 'lungi dance' kara rahi he
 The Congress is not only forcing Chidambaram on the people of Maharashtra, but is also throwing stones at its feet

 isliye congress ab yah lungi dance maharashtra ke maathe madhne kaa paap kar rahi he
 Shiv Sena said that leaders are being sent to Rajya Sabha from the backdoor, even before many leaders were taken to Parliament from Maharashtra, but they did nothing for the state
 sirf rajyasabha main aankada badhaane ke liye kisi netaa ko maharashtra par thope dena thik nahin he
 In the face of 'is Congress really left', Shiv Sena questioned, 'chidambaram and Kapil Sibal, these two lawyers have been brought to the Rajya Sabha to talk about Congress, but is there really anything left of Congress in the country today?' Shiv Sena has termed Congress's decision to send Chidambaram to Rajya Sabha from Maharashtra as unfair

 Being told aise main film ke saamne badi chunauti acha karne kii he
 Word of mouth will also work for this film, but overall there is little hope of any record breaking
 haa, fursat he to film ek baar dekhi ja sakati he

 ghar kaa khaanaa, isaki ahmiyat hamen tabhi pataa chalati he jab ham ghar se dur apni padhai or naukari ke liye jate hai
 Earlier food for me was also common
 pehle jab mujhe is bare main bataaya jaataa tha to yah sab majaak lagata tha
 But today when away from home, i understand what the taste of simple home food is
 meraa naam saumya he or yah baat haitin saal pehle ki jab main naukari ke liye apane shahar lakhanu se dilli ai
 The culture here was quite different
 logon kii bhashaa main bhi bahut bada fark tha
 Here things used to start with you and not with you
 haalanki in baton se maine kabhi asahaj mahasoos nahin kiya
 But the price of which came to this city and came to know was the food of the house
 mujhe sirf megi banani aati thi
 So i relied on dhabas or tiffin serve for both meals
 kabhi canteen to kabhi street food to kabhi restaurant main khaanaa khaakar kaam chal jaataa tha
 Sometimes, if a friend brings home food, then the lottery used to go out
 aakhirkaar baahar kaa khaanaa khaakar tang ho chuki meri tabiyat ne jawaab de diya
 i bought a gas stove and started making my favorite recipes on Google
 khaanaa bananaa itnaa bhi mushkil or bekaar kaam nahin tha, jitna maine sochaa tha
 Now within two years, i have become an expert in cooking
 yah meraa maananaa nahin, mere doston or meri maa kaa kahana he, jo mere khaanaa banaakar khaane se behad khush hai
 Not only this, friends who do not know how to cook on their own, i cook them often
 ye kahani thi saumya sharma kii, jinhone ghar se baahar rahakar apane anubhav ko hamase share kiya
