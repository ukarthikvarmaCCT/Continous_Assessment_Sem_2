 officiala post shared byvivek Oberoi(@vivekoberoi) onapr 5, 2019 at 7:15am pdtgorawalaba he ki vivek obaroy kii film 'piem modi' kai kaarnon se vivaad main he
 There is a dispute about the content of the film, the release date of this film has also been finalized after much tussle
 pehle film 12 april ko relies honi thi phir isaki date ko 5 april kiya gaya lekin aakhirkaar film 11 april ko relies hone ja rahi he
 Vivek announced it on social media
 film main pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa role play kar rahe vivek oberoi ne isse pehle kaha tha ki 'ye ek aaazaad mulk he or mujhe ek film banane kii or ise relies karne kii ijaajat he
 However, many opposition parties believe that the film was used only for the propaganda of PM Modi before the election
 himachal pradesh main isi saal ke aakhir main chunaav hone vaale hai
 The failure in the recently concluded elections of 5 states has forced the Congress to think afresh
 sibiai kii talwaar mukhyamantri virbhadra singh par lagaataar latak rahi he
 The case is now on the court of the largest court
 somvaar ko maamle kii sunwaayee he, aise main lagaataar virbhadra singh ke saath khadi congress ne plan bi bhi taiyaar kiya he
 In fact, till now, Congress and himself Virbhadra Singh were describing the action of the CBI as motivated by the vengeance of the central government
 lekin aay se zyaada sampatti ke maamle ab somvaar ko supreme court main sunwaayee he, aise main ab congress alaakaman ko dar he ki, kahin adaalat ne koi tikhi tippanee kar di or virbhadra ko raahat nahin di to phir naitikta kaa dabaav kaaphi bad jayega
 In such a situation, the high command standing with Virbhadra Singh has also made Plan B
 plan bi ke tahat, agar kisi halaat main siem ko badalanaa pade to do naam hai
 The first name is Asha Kumari, in-charge of Punjab, who also holds the crown of Punjab's success and is a five-time MLA
 saath hi doosraa naam he varisht netaa kaul singh thakur kaa
 But currently Asha Kumari is at the forefront of the race
 udhar, maamle kii gambhirtha samajhate hue mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ne alaakaman ko suzav diya he ki, navambar 2017 main chunaav tay hai, april chal rahaa he , aise main wo jaldi chunaav karakar janata ke bich chale jaaen or janata kii adaalat main nyaay maange
 In fact, Virbhadra Singh feels that, once the elections are announced, he will be able to take political advantage among the public by declaring himself a victim of the conspiracy of the BJP
 aise main ab kaaphi kuch adaalat main sunwaayee par tay hoga, lekin june main 83 saal ke hone ja rahe virbhadra singh ke liye agle kuch din khaase ahm sabit ho sakate hai
 At present, no Congress leader is ready to speak about this Plan b on this matter
 aakhir maamla kaddavar virbhadra singh kaa he or party chaahati he ki, aakhir vaqt tak virbhadra ke saath khadi rahe or iskaa ehsaas bhi virbhadra singh ko ho, jisase party majabuuran agar koi faisla kare to virbhadra bhi us faisle ko maan len, bagawati naa hon
 In Panvel area of navi Mumbai, a church has been attacked by some unknown people, after which security arrangements have been tightened in the area
 bataaya jaataa he ki teen agyaat logon ne shuukravaar der raat kareeb do baje saint jorge catholic carch par pathar barasaaye
 The entire incident has been captured in the CCTV camera, while an FIR has been lodged in the Khandeshwar police station
 police se mili jaankaree ke mutabik, shuukravaar raat kareeb do baje motorcycle par savaar hokar teen log aae
 In this, two attackers sitting in the back seat threw stones at St
 George Catholic Church
 is ghatana main saint jorge kii pratimaa kaa sheesha tut gaya
 The police officer said that CCTV cameras have recorded footage of the incident, but the attackers have not been identified
 bike par savaar teenon logon ne apane-apane chehron ko kapadon se dhank rakhaa tha
 This church was built in 2007, with eight hundred people can pray together
 gauratlab he ki beete kuch dinon se lagaataar carch par hamale kii khabaren aa rahi he
 Recently, an under-construction church in Hisar, Haryana was vandalized and a red flag was waved over it
 maamle main haryana sarkaar kii ore se jawaab aayaa ki carch avaidh jameen bana tha
 While condemning the incident, the central government has also sought a report from the state government
 isse pehle beete dinon dilli main ek carch par hamale ke baad police kamishnar bies bassi ko bhi sarkaar ne talab kiya tha
 The central government has swung into action after taking the issue of inhumane treatment of martyr Captain Saurabh Kalia to the international court
 sarkaar ne apane puraane rukh ke ulat yah faisla liya he ki maamle ko antarrashtriya court le jane kii sambhaavnaaen talaashi jaaengi or is sambandh main supreme court se ijaajat maangi jaaegi
 The government had earlier refused to appeal to the international court on this issue
 lekin hamaare sahyogi akhbaar 'mail today' kii khabar ke baad din bhar yah mudda raajnneetik galiyaaron or soshal media main charchaa kaa vishay bana rahaa
 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj herself had to come to give a statement on this from the central government that came on the backfoot
 unhone media se baatcheet main kaha ki centre sarkaar supreme court se is sambandh main ijaajat legi or agar sheersh court ne ijaajat di to yah mudda antarrashtriya court main uthaaya jayega
 The torture given to Captain Kalia in the category of exception: Sushma Swaraj, during his visit to Udaipur, told that the Union Government decided on a matter in a meeting
 sarkaar ne mana he ki captain kaaliya ko jo yatnaaen di gayi, ve apwaad kii shrenee main aati hai
 Therefore, the government will change its affidavit filed in the Supreme Court and seek permission to go to the international court
 agar supreme court ne hari jhandi di to sarkaar antarrashtriya court main apil karegi
 In fact, as of now being a Commonwealth country, both countries do not take matters related to war to international courts
 aapako bataa den ki saal 1999 menkargil yudhke dauraan 4 jat regiment ke captain saurabh kaaliya ke saath paanch anya bhartiya javaanon ko pakistani sainikon ne bandhak bana liya tha
 Pakistan tortured them a lot and they died after some time due to inhuman treatment
 inke shav ko jabpakistan ne bharatbheja to parivaar or desh dekhakar shav kii haalat dekhakar dahal gaya
 Since then, the family has been demanding action against Pakistani soldiers
 pehle antarrashtriya court nahin jane vaali thi sarkaaravahin, jab pichley dinon sansad main is mudde ko uthaaya gaya ki kya is hatya ke maamle ko international court of justise (isije) ke saamne rakhaa jayega, jisase pakistani sainikon ko sajaa mil sake? to jawaab main sarkaar ne kaha, 'is maamle ko neuyork adhiveshan ke dauraan 22 sitambar 1999 ko or maanavadhikaar ayog ko april 2000 main hi avgat kara diya gaya he
 All aspects of legal action were also considered through international court, but this does not seem possible
 'lagbhag ek saal pehle utyub par ek video bhi viral hua tha, jisamen ek pakistani sainik sweekaarta he ki 32 saal ke ek army officer ko kargil yuddh ke dauraan bandhak banaakar usapar khub atyaachaar kiya gaya tha
 At that time there was a Vajpayee government in the country, there has been a demand for justice since then and today there is a BJP government, but the matter is being suppressed
 saurabh kaaliya ke pita ne supreme court main nyaay ke liye arji lagaai thi, lekin is par kuch nahin kiya gaya
 Tortures were given to Saurabh Kalia in 1999
 Let me tell you that Captain Saurabh Kalia of the 4 Jat Regiment was the first army officer who reported the Pakistani incursion into Kargil in 1999
 unhen paanch javaanon ke saath 15 may 1999 ko pakad liya gaya tha
 On 6 June 1999, the Pakistani Army returned the body to the Indian Army
 sharir par cigarette se jalaane, kaan ko garm rod se senkane ke nishaan the
 Apart from this, the eye was shattered
 daant toote the tathaa haddiyon or qamar ko tukade-tukade main kaata gaya tha
 At the same time, Saurabh's father is very angry with this attitude of the government towards the soldiers
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe laga tha bijepi sarkaar zyada deshbhakt hogi, lekin afsos kii ye sarkaar bhi waisi hi he
 It is clear from the statement of Minister of State for External Affairs VK Singh on the question asked in Parliament by MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar that even the new government is not in favor of providing justice to the Kargil men
 'ullekhneey he ki saurabh kaaliya ke pita enke kaaliya ne 2012 main supreme court kaa rukh kiya
 They demand that the Ministry of External Affairs take up this issue in the International Court of Justice so that the Pakistani soldiers who killed their son can take action against them, because such treatment is a violation of the Geneva Convention with prisoners of war
 saurabh ke pita enke kaaliya 16 saal baad bhi apane bete ke liye nyaay ke liye ladaai kar rahe hai

 Ever since Yogi Adityanath's government has come in Uttar Pradesh, the police has been engaged in the cleansing of criminals
 kai hajaar encounter kar chuki upi police ne ab tak ek se badhkar ek kukhyat aparaadhiyon ko salaakhon ke peeche pahunchaa diya he, lekin noida se ek lakh rupee ke inami kukhyat apradhi shravan choudhary kaa encounter upi police kii sabase badi kamyaabi maani ja rahi he
 While in Shamli, SSP Ajaypal Sharma forced the criminals to roam with the 'forgive us' plank, where he made it the biggest success when he took over Noida
 police kii goli se dher shravan choudhary kii baad main aspataal main ilaaj ke dauraan maut ho gai
 Hearing how vicious a criminal Shravan was, it would be clear to see his list of crimes
 chori se kii shuruyatshravan choudhary ek kukhyat aaropee tha
 Shravan used to steal cars and smuggle them
 shuruyaat main vah chote vaahan chori kiya karata tha
 After this, he started getting demand for luxury vehicles, then he started looting
 is bich jaraayam kii duniya main uskaa naam itnaa bad gaya ki gadiyon kii kharid farokht ke liye usne apana ek puraa gang bana daalaa
 Where was the network spread? It is being told that its network was spread in more than eight states
 shravan ke aapraadhik kukarmon kaa dayera mukhya rup se dilli, upi, jharkhand or haryana tak failaa hua tha
 In the past, Shravan has also been accused of being involved in several murders
 shravan ke naam par alag alag rajyon main 14 cese darj hai
 After which a reward of 50-50 thousand rupees was declared on its head in Delhi and Noida
 dilli ensiaar main aparaadh kii duniya main kadam rakhane vaale shravan ne ek dashak main car lut kaa bahut bada giroh bana liya tha
 Apart from this, for the last two years, the car was somewhat more active in robbery
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki luti gadiyon ko vah jharkhand va chhattisgarh main jaakar supplai kar detaa tha
 The Naxalites were also related to the thieves, as well as the name of Shravan had increased so much in the world of Jaraim, its links were also linked with the Naxalites in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh
 shravan chori kar naksaliyon ko lagjri gaadiyaan supplai karne laga
 For this, he used to steal luxury cars from Delhi, UP, Jharkhand and Haryana
 iske alawa aparaadh kii duniya ke is badshaah kaa sampark maharashtra, andhra pradesh, chhattisgarh va jharkhand ke naksaliyon se bhi hone kii jaankaree mili he, jise lekar police abhi jaanch kar rahi he
 According to this, according to Shravan's gang police, the vicious Shravan had formed his own gang, but he did not believe anyone
 shuruyaat main to usne kai girohon ke liye kaam kiye, lekin apana gang banane ke baad usne kisi anya gang se sampark nahin rakhaa
 Recently, Shravan's brother was also caught in Delhi
 vah nayaa giroh banane vaala tha, jiske liye use nae gang members kii talash thi
 So that the gang can be expanded further and major incidents can be carried out
 gavaahon ko lagava detaa tha thikaneshravan ke gang kii itane lambey samay tak police ke hathe na chadhane kii sabase badi vajah yah thi ki pakade jane par vah gavaah ko hi marava detaa tha
 Last year, a man was killed in Seelampur
 isamen shravan choudhary va uskaa bhai aaropee he
 His brother is lodged in Tihar Jail in Delhi in this case
 shravan kii yojana thi ki is maamle main donon bhaaiyon ke khilaaf gavaah dene waalon kii hatya kar di jaae
 So that his brother is left
 vah isi makasad se kuch dinon se dilli-noida main adhik sakriy tha or iske liye nae logon kii talash kar rahaa tha
 Shravan did love marriage: Shravan did love marriage
 antarjaatiy vivahakarne ke kaaran uskaa ghar main virodh bhi hua tha, lekin baad main sabhi maan gaye the
 After marriage, his network grew and he moved away from the family
 haalanki police se bachane ke liye patni ke saath idhar-udhar ghoomane jaataa tha
 Did not keep the phone
 It is said that Shravan Chaudhary did not keep a mobile with him to escape from the police
 kyonki use mobile ke zariye trek ho jane kaa dar tha
 If he had to talk to someone, he would call someone else's mobile, then immediately run away from there
 vah apane saathiyon ke phone se bas kahin milane kii jagah final karata tha
 After this, while sitting in the car, he stopped the phones of his colleagues and used to plan crime while traveling on the way
 is kaaran vah police kii najar se kaaphi dinon tak bachataa rahaa
 Police recovered the AK-47 from Shravan's car after the AK-47 was recovered
 police abhi isaki jaanch kar rahi he
 However, preliminary investigation has revealed that the AK 47 may have been purchased from Nepal
 eke 47 par likhe gaye number kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 Police suspect that Shravan may have received this from AK 47 Naxalite organizations
 vahiin car se baraamad rifl noida ke hi bisarakh thana kshetra se 5 sitambar ko luti gai thi
 In this way, the police sleuths had been on the radar of the police for the past several months
 lekin kadi koshishon ke baavjood police shravan ko giraftaar nahin kar paa rahi thi
 Meanwhile, the police had put many informers behind him in Delhi and Noida to keep an eye on Shravan, who could get information about him
 isi dauraan police ko uske noida phej 3 ke gadhi golchakkar par hone kii khabar mili, jiske baad police ne ilaake kii gherebandi kar di
 Police and Shravan also face to face gangs, but Shravan fired at the police team
 police ne bhi jawaab main firing kii or ek goli shravan ko lag gai
 Shravan, who had been synonymous with terror for nearly a decade, had fallen to the ground
 police ne use giraftaar kar liya or turant aspataal pahunchaaya, haalanki uski jaan nahin bachaai ja saki

 The Mahagathbandhan government in Bihar is difficult
 mushkil isliye kyonki mahagathbandhan ke ghatak dal raashtrapati chunaav ko lekar do hisson main bant gaye hai
 On the one hand, the Janata Dal of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is supporting Ramnath Kovind, the governor of u Bihar, on the other hand, the Congress has made its candidate Meera Kumar, which is supported by RJD
 mahagathbandhan main janata dal you or argedy ke netaa ek dusre par nishaanaa saadh rahe hai
 But Congress is far from it
 vah khamosh he
 The Congress is hopeful that on the one hand Nitish Kumar will reconsider his decision, on the other hand it is silently stating that after the Presidential election decision, the Congress may also consider taking a big step in Bihar
 sutron ke mutabik ye faisla mahagathbandhan sarkaar se samarthan waapas lene kaa bhi ho saktaa he
 However, on Monday, senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, on the attitude of Nitish Kumar, heard him very well, but this did not show any effect on the Janata Dal U
 bihar ke mukhyamantri or janata dal you ke rashtriya adhyaksh nitish kumaar pehle hi yah bataa chuke he ki unki party kyon endie ke ummidavaar ramnath kovind kaa samarthan kar rahi he or vipaksh bihar kii beti mira kumaar ko haraane ke liye unhen maidan me utaar rahi he
 If that was the case, then why did the Congress not land in Kumadan when the Congress had a majority
 party aaj bhi usee par kaayam or aage bhi rahegi
 Janata Dal u spokesperson Ajay Alok says that the President does not belong to any party or Jamaat
 ham aaj bhi apane faisle par kaayam hai
 According to internal reports from Bihar Congress, many Congress mlas may vote in favor of NDA
 daawa duusari taraf se bhi kiya ja rahaa he ki janata dal you ke vidhayak mira kumaar ke samarthan main aaenge
 But it is too early to say anything on this
 par itnaa to tay he ki aankadon ke hisaab se endie ke ummidavaar ramnath kovind kii jeet nishchit he
 There is a slight decrease in the nozzle between the Janata Dal u and the RJD
 argedy supremeo ne nitish kumaar par tippanee karne vaale vidhayak bhai virendra ko talab kar apane bayaan par lagaam lagane kii naseehat di, to pravaktaa par karrwai karte hue pad se hataa bhi diya
 JDU is satisfied at the moment but it cannot be stopped
 baharhaal bhale hi mahagathbandhan ke netaa ye kah rahe hai ki sabakuch thik-thaak he, lekin andar hi andar aag sulag rahi he
 The Congress is also silent because after the defeat in the presidential election, it will boil over some or the other, where else will there be a fair chance from the Grand Alliance
 halaki, in sabake peeche congress ke varisht netaa seepi joshi ke us bayaan ko mana ja rahaa he jisamen unhone kaha tha ki mahagathbandhan kaa astitv keval bihar main he, bihar ke baahar nahin
 In such a situation, the Janata Dal u believes that the election of the President is the election of the country and not of Bihar

 justise markandeya katju ko supreme court kii rosemara kii vyasttaaon ke bich bhagavad gita se aise satyavachana rah-rah kar ugalane kii aadat thi- ''anant, akhand, achhed, abhedya”
 By saying such words, he would stay for a few moments, Goya was taking some shape within him
 adaalat ke bheetar har koi takataki lagaae unki baton ko samajhane kii aas main unhen dekhtaa rahata
 Then suddenly a smile smiled on their lips and they would say, "truth is what it is
" ” yah sunakar vakil ek-duusare kii ankhon main dekhne lagate yaa phir dabi jabaan main kuch bhunbhunate to ve hameshaa kii tarah achaanak chilla uthte, ''aap kuch nahin padhate ho or paisa lete ho
 His indignant tendency and habit of telling the truth finally made a place for him in history
 unka likhaa blog, 'haau a karpt jaj continud in da madras hycourt’ kaaphi charchit ho chukaa he
 The 28-year-old agenda of the executive in judiciary standards, accountability and appointments will probably reach the expected results
 sarkaar ke liye isamen acchhee khabar yah he ki use aise mukhar nyaayadhish pasand nahin, jo ghotaalon ke khilaaf bolkar janamanas ke dilon main apni jagah bana saken
 After the revelation made on 20 July by Justice Katju, a new and interesting chapter seems to have opened
 nyaaypalika kii khandaani viraasat ke vaahak 68 varshiya vidwaan justise katju uske baad se hi televijan par lagaataar abhiyaan chede hue hai
 He teamed up with the UPA government over the three former Chief Justices of India, a corrupt extra judge
s
 ashok kumaar ko behaal karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 He has attributed the hand of DMK, a coalition partner of UPA, to a leader whose bail was granted by the said judge
 yah tab hua, jab 2004 main ukt jaj ko madras hycourt kaa mukhya nyaayadhish bana diya gaya
 Katju moved to the Delhi High Court in 2005 and became a Supreme Court judge in 2006
 justise katju ko itnaa gussa kyon aata he? shaayad kisi ko nahin maaloom, lekin unke kaarykaal main april, 2006 se lekar sitambar, 2011 ke bich supreme court parisar main unki adaalat number chah se zyada jeevant cameraa or kisi kaa nahin hota tha
 In October 2011, he was made the President of the Press Council
 uske baad se pichley teen saal ke dauraan aisa lagata he ki unhone puure desh ko hi apni adaalat maan liya he
 Apart from expressing his solid opinion on almost every issue, from the IQ level of Indians to Salman Rushdie's prose and Mamata Banerjee's commentary on Pakistan, the spotlight on quoting Tulsidas, Shakespeare and Ghalib turned him into this country's favorite curiosity is
 apane blog 'satyam bruyat’ kii pehali post main unhone 31 disambar, 2012 ko likhaa tha, ''mujhe bahut se logon ne ahamkaari, sanakee, arajak, prachaar premi, asabhy, munhfat or yahaan tak ki ek aisa kutta (ek mukhyamantri ne) bhi kaha he, jo 'har baat par’ tippanee karata he
 "in curiosity, the man also questions
 is maamle main justise katju par kai sawaal hai
 The first question is why Katju was unable to bring corruption to the fore for nine years (while the guilty judge was alive)? Was it not a binding duty for a person sitting in a constitutional post to expose this? To what extent did they engage in this case? This question is because according to Article 217 (1) of the Constitution, the judges of the High Court are appointed by the President with the opinion of the Chief Justice of India, the Governor and the Chief Justice of the High Court
 bahut se logon ke liye yah samajhnaa mushkil hoga ki jawaharlal nehru ke kareebi sahyogi kailashnath katju ke pote justise katju congressnith sarkaar ke itane khilaaf ja sakate hai
 a year ago, in February 2013, bjp's top leader Arun Jaitley asked Katju to leave the chairmanship of the Press Council when he took on non-congress governments (besides Katju remarking that "I Mr
 Modi does not believe that Mr
 Modi had no role in the 2002 riots
 )”jetali ke mutabik aise bayaan ''un logon ko ek dhanyavad gyaapan kii tarah the, jinhone sevanivritti ke baad katju ko naukari di
 "justice Katju is not the only one who was hired by the UPA government after his retirement
 aise darjanon ritred jaj aayogon or panchaton main baithe hai
 However, the post of Lokpal is yet to be filled in the country and every day there is new speculation about it
 ho saktaa he ki aane vaale dinon main kuch or zyada dilachasp dekhne ko mili
 In Katju's words, "let the truth be the truth

 paanch saal main sarkaar ke kaam ke vigyaapan par paanch hazaar karod se adhik karch karne or lagaataar reliyaan karte rahane ke baad bhi pradhanmantri sarkari karche se 100 reliyaan kar lenaa chaahate hai
 He has decided to conduct 100 rallies before the code of conduct
 is lihaaz se 100 zilon main unki raily kii taiyaari chal rahi hogi
 How much government expenditure would be incurred on a rally, so that all the rallies held during his tenure would have been accounted for, we would have known that the Prime Minister has spent several thousand crores just in holding rallies
 raily karnaa pradhanmantri kaa adhikaar he
 But they have begun to understand it as work
 jin chizon kii suchi shuru main ginai unke shilanyas se lekar udghaatan kaa kaam unke mantri or saansad kar sakate the
 But when the Prime Minister is going to Odisha to start the work of renovation of the temple and go to Kerala to plaque the Swadesh Darshan Scheme, then the relevance of these rallies should be questioned
 ye sabhi sarkari reliyaan hai
 Therefore, various schemes are being included so that the public feels that the Prime Minister is coming to his city from work
 pichley ek maheene main pradhanmantri modi ke kaaryakramon kii press vijyaptiyaan padhein to pataa chalegaa ki is vaqt post ofis se lekar bypass tak kaa udghaatan pradhanmantri hi kar rahe hai
 The PIB has published all the releases on the website
 beshak kai jagahon par badi yojanaayen hai magar kai aisi hai jinka zikr abhi-abhi kiya
 The foundation stone of Gangajal's plan at Agra rally is understandable, but it is not understood that the Prime Minister will lay the foundation stone of the plan to install CCTV in the entire Agra city
 yah kaam to sthaneey saansad ke hisse aana chahie tha
 In the speech, the Prime Minister says that the installation of CCTV will help Agra to become a world class smart city! True! If a city can be a smart city with CCTV, then every toy and clothes shop should be declared a smart shop because CCTV is installed there
 atm ko smart atm ghoshit kar dena chahie kyonki vahaan sisitivi laga he!shilanyas or udghaatan kii suchi isliye lambii kii ja rahi he taaki use sarkari kaarykram kaa aavaran diya ja sake
 But after looking at the detail, it seems that the administration is somehow planning to make their rally official
 kyonki is vaqt in reliyon kaa aayojan to sarkari karche se hi ho rahaa he
 The Prime Minister will hold 100 rallies in 122 parliamentary seats in 20 states
 ek khabar ke anusaar farvari tak 50 reliyaan khatm kar lenge
 It seems that a doctor has written the number of rallies like a medicine
 ek raily subah or ek raily shaam ko kar len aap behatar feel karenge
 Looks like you have work
 logon ko bhi lagegaa ki aapke paas kaam he
 That is why the Prime Minister is sometimes Agra, sometimes Bolangir, sometimes Silvassa and sometimes Kollam
 aachaar samhita ke baad unki 100 se to kam reliyaan nahin hongi
 Twenty-five rallies would have been held in the recent assembly elections as well
 lagata he unhone pradhanmantri karyaalay chhod diya he
 For them, the PMO remains like a bus station
 ve ek raily se duusari raily ke bich bas badalane yaa kapade badalane piemo aate hai
 After reaching there, they meet a foreign guest and leave for the next rally
 ek raily karne main pradhanmantri ko kam se kam paanch ghante to lagate hi honge
 Coming and going, preparing for speech are many things
 aap is ausat se khud hisaab kar len
 It would take 500 hours to do 100 rallies
 yani bees din
 So the account says that he will not do any work for twenty days of the first three to four months of the new year
 sarkari karmchaaree kii chuttee bhi 28 dinon kii hoti he
 Yet the Prime Minister can only say this that he works day and night
 chalis lakh se adhik karmchaaree, sattar ke aas-paas mantri, anek sachiv, sanyukt sachiv phir bhi pradhanmantri hi din-raat kaam karte hai
 The question is, what else do the people then do that they send the Prime Minister to the inauguration of the godown and checkpost? Does the Prime Minister have so much time? Or they have understood that work means speech

 com / 55p5lruc14 Deepika, Ranveer Singh and Shahid Kapoor starrer Padmavat has been officially announced for release on January 25
 is date par akshay kumaar kii pedman bhi relies ho rahi he
 The box office clash of both the big films will have an impact on their business
 film pedman kii produsar or akshay kii patni tvinkal khanna ne is klesh ko donon hi filmon ke liye nuksaandeh bataaya he
 Twinkle Khanna said that this clash at the box office is not good for both parties
 donon hi filmon par is klesh kaa asar padegaa
 But it is also true that Padmavat's makers have had to struggle a lot for the release date
 lekin meri ichha thi ki bhansaali kii film pedman se ek hafte pehle yaa ek hafte baad relies hoti
 Padmaavat will be released in 3 languages only on January 25, the child actress will not be able to watch alone
 lekin hamen apni film ke content par bhi bharosa he
 That is why we do not want to tamper with our release date
 ham pedman kii 25 janvari kii relies se khush hai
 Akshay Kumar's film Padman is based on social issues
 pehle charchaa thi ki padmavat kii vajah se pedman kii date aage khiskegi lekin nirmaataa pehle se nirdhaarit date par hi film relies ko taiyaar hai
 However, the dates of the film Aiyari, released just a day after Padmavat, were carried forward
 niraj pandey kii ye film ab 9 farvari ko relies hogi
 Does Bhansali want this for a big reason, to be released only on January 25, 'padmavat' Let us know that Padmavat will be released in 2D, 3D and Imax 3D in India and worldwide
 film sanjay lila bhansaali ke trademark style main banaai gai he
 Has partnered with Paramount Pictures to distribute the film
 bhansaali ke film kii shooting shuru hone ke baad se hi karani sena lagaataar virodh kar rahi he
 It is alleged that the film has tampered with historical facts

 a big twist has come before the judgment on the bail of Salman Khan, who is jailed in the black deer hunting case
 yachika par sunwaayee kar rahe jodhpur seshans court ke jaj rabindra kumaar joshi kaa tabadalaa ho gaya he
 The Rajasthan High Court late night issued orders for outright transfers of 87 judges, including Joshi's name
 ye transfar isliye ahm he kyonki jodhpur seshans court main aaj subah saadhe das baje salmaan khan kii bel par sunwaayee honi he
 Hearing on Bell on Friday, Judge Ravindra Joshi reserved the decision and now his transfer has become Sirohi
 joshi kii jagah lenge chandrakumarajoshi kii jagah jodhpur seshans court ke nae jaj ab chandrakumar songra honge
 In such a situation, suspense has been created on who will hear the Bell after the transfer of the current judge
 haalanki, jaankaree ke mutabik ye baat saamne aa rahi he ki chandrakumar aaj charge nahin sanbhaalenge
 If such a situation arises and Joshi does not even hear, then it is possible that the bail petition be transferred to another court
 routine main aisa hota rahaa he
 What to change from transfer The transfer is important because on Friday, Judge Ravindra Joshi made this comment during the bail debate, he will look at the court order carefully and after hearing all the arguments of Salman's lawyer, the decision on Bell to date Deferred
 aise main bel par sunwaayee rabindra joshi ke bajaay nae jaj chandrakumar karte hai yaa phir kisi or court main bel yachika jaati he to is baat kii bhi ashanka he ki salmaan ko aaj bhi raahat na mil paae
 However, senior counsel KK Manan said that since Judge Joshi had reserved the judgment yesterday (friday), it is more likely that he will pronounce the verdict on Salman's bail today
 vahiin, kaala hiran shikaar cese main bishnoi samaaj ke vakil mahipal bishnoi kaa kahana he ki april ke maheene main aise routine transfar pehle bhi hote rahe hai, isliye ise kisi tarah dekhnaa uchit nahin he
 However, suspense remains on Salman's bail till now
 agar salmaan ko aaj jamaanat nahin milti he to unhen kam se kam do din or jail kii salaakhon ke peeche gujaarne padenge
 Tomorrow will not be held due to Sunday
 isliye aaj salmaan or unke parivaar ke liye behad ahm din he

 ’ unhone aarope lagaaya ki mulaayam singh yadav durga kaa nilamban chaahate the kyonki unki ret mafia se ‘santh ganth’ he jinke khilaaf esadm ne abhiyaan chalaa rakhaa tha
 Verma said, 'that girl is innocent
 agar sammaan ke saath use behaal nahin kiya gaya to rajya sarkaar ko parinaam bhugatna padegaa
 In the context of the disproportionate assets case against Yadav, the Congress leader said that the case should be properly investigated
 unhone kaha, ‘haalanki mulaayam ko jail nahin bheja janaa chahie kyonki main aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon main unke khilaaf chunaav ladanaa chahta hum
 Verma has again targeted Yadav at such a time when the party has asked him to refrain from making any comments against the SP chief

 # rubaruroshnia post shared byaamir Khan (@_ aamirkhan) onjan 25, 2019 at 9:19 pm PST Two types of attitudes emerge regarding the events shown in Rubaru Roshni
 film main sanvaadon ke jariye donon pakshon kaa najariya, ghatana kii tamaam detail or uske peeche maujuuda raajnneetik soch kii bhoomika saamne aati rahati he
 Before and after the incident, there is no need to tell what both sides must be thinking towards each other
 lekin jab apradhi or peedit paksh ek duusare ke saamne hote hai to bilkul ek alag hi najariya nikal kar aata he
 These are precious human qualities

 balki isaki kahani vaastavik sanvaadon (jo intervyuu style main he), drishyon, sandarbh ke taur par puraani footage ke sahare khud bi khud bunati chali gai he
 While this storytelling is not new, but with the help of dialogues as the three stories progress to their "conclusion", you go through many emotional moments
 jawaab dar jawaab, kai sawaal nikalate rahete hai, jo sambandhit ghatnaon se jude hai
 Narrator (aamir Khan) has been resorted to at some places
 sawaal jawaab main ek kahani banati gai he
 Like an interesting, engaging story line
 kai samvaad jhakzor kar rakh dete hai
 a second view is taken and the eyes are opened with respect to the related incidents
 rubaru roshni bahut hi samvedansheel or prabhavi kathan he
 In fact, its effect can be felt only by looking at it
 isamen manoranjan jaisaa kuch bhi nahin he
 But there are questions and answers to every round
 i-wolet company freecharge ke bure din chal rahe hai
 Recently, the freecharge parent company Snapdeal laid off 600 employees
 itnaa hi nahin freecharge ke siio govind rajan ko bhi hataaya gaya
 The company's founders were also cut in salary

 For this, international payment company paypal is being negotiated

 In 2015, Snapdeal bought it for $ 400 million
 haalanki papele or freecharge donon ne hi philhal is deal ke bare main kuch bhi nahin kaha he
 According to reports, Anupama Pahuja, managing director of paypal India, has said, "we want to play a big role in India's digital payments space
" ham chaahate hai ki hamaare products ke jariye yugers ke finantial system main acces loktantric banaaen
 Cash will become an old concept in the coming days' It is also being said that after this deal, the world's largest online payment company Direct can step into India
 philhal yah company bhartiya marchents ko pement getwe detii he
 Recently, paypal accused Paytm of stealing the logo

 supreme court ne jepi associats ko hajaar karod main se kam se kam 600 karod rupee jamaa karne ko kaha he
 jp's lawyer Fali S
 Nariman, who had expressed his inability to deposit thousands of crores of rupees, asked his client to take instructions
 bataa den ki jepi kaa kahana tha ki pehle court unhen NCLT elahabaad main chal rahe mukademe ko jald nipataane ke aadesh de tabhi wo itani badi rakam jamaa kar sakate hai

 Over the years, India Today Group's annual ranking of the country's business schools has been accepted as an authentic document on the state of management education in India
 surveykshan ne apane daayre or vishleshan kaa vistaar kiya he, jo ab santhaan ke buniyadi dhaanche se lekar shiksha kii gunvattta or vahaan padhai par kharch kiye ja rahe paise ke ritern tak par, isse jude har pariprekshya ko prastut karata he
 Even though Indian business schools are cheaper than most global institutes, it is quite expensive to get a management degree or diploma in the country
 haalanki, iske liye kharch kii jane vaali dhan raashi bahes kaa vishay ho sakati he, lekin shiksha kii gunvattta par koi samjhauta nahin ho saktaa
 In this context, the importance of India Today Group's survey of business schools is increasing year after year
 sahi bijness skool main daakhila, aksar kariyar banane yaa bigaadpee main sabase mahatvapurn kadam hote hai
 According to data from the All India Management Association (AIMA), the highest national institution for the management (management) profession in India, approximately 3,60,000 MBA students from 4,000 B-schools in India take a bachelor's degree every year
 haalanki, inamen se keval 60 fisadi snaatakon ko hi naukari mil paati he
 Therefore, this survey conducted every year proves helpful for students seeking to study management and understand the trends of management education
 udhaaharan ke liye, bazaar anusandhan agency emdiare kii ore se kiye gaye is varsh ke surveykshan main 2014 ke baad se bijness skulon ke pradarshan kaa lekha-jokha taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Such an assessment also becomes very important because all the business schools — except iims and some traditionally prestigious private schools — face regular criticism from stakeholders and experts
 udhaaharan ke liye, associated chambers of commers and industry of india (asocham) kii 2013 kii report 'bi-skool and ejineering colejes shat down-big bijness stregal' main teen chetavaniyaan di gayi jo is prakaar se hai:kai nijee skool kuch management guruon kii ore se nivesh ke jariye kuch paise kamaane ke ek bijness model bhar hai
 Many MBA schools are eager to be seen in the media
 ve apni uplabdhiyon ko bataane ke liye pramukh akhabaaron main kai-kai pannon ke vigyaapan dete hai
 Do not consider MBA as a mandatory reputation tag to ensure success in the industry
 
 
 apni vartmaan sthiti, apane dirghakaalik lakshyon (or shaayad) apane paas uplabdh paise kaa bhi achche se moolyankan karen
 The report also claimed that barring graduates from Indian Institutes of Management, other business schools in the country are rapidly losing their shine and only 10 percent of their graduates are eligible for employment
 chah saal baad, paridrishy zyada nahin badla he
 In fact, an India Today poll found that fewer private business schools ranked in the top 25 in 2019 compared to 2014
 india skill report 2019 ke anusaar, pratibha moolyankan form wheebox kii ore se taiyaar kii gai emb kii padhai karne vaale chaatro kii rojgaar yogyata 2014 main 41
 It was 02 percent, it decreased to 36 in 2019
 44 pratishat rah gai he
 The most shocking fact of this figure is that while there was such a decline in MBA, the employability of students studying in all other streams increased from 34 percent in 2014 to 47 percent in 2019
 yahaan tak ki vaishvik surveykshanon ne bhi bharat main prabandhan sansthaanon or snaatakon kii gunvattta main is kramik giravat ko mahasoos kiya he
 In the 2019 'world Talent Report' by IMD, a top global business school based in Switzerland, India's ranking of 63 countries slipped to 53rd position from 29th in 2005
 is giravat ke peeche jo kaarak bataae gaye the unamem bharat ke paathyakram kaa badale daur main vyavsaay kii jaruraton ke anuroop na hona pramukh rahaa
 The ranking was based on an assessment of the country's capabilities in areas such as workplace training, education and language skills
 sanketakon main sthaneey pratibhaaon ko nikhaarane main kiye gaye nivesh or pratibhaaon ko aakarshith karne or unhen banaae rakhane main deshon kaa pradarshan bhi shaamil tha
 The biggest reason for management students not being able to find jobs is found to be the lack of skills to suit their needs
 vartmaan naukari bazaar main sabase badi chunautiyon main se ek he istemaal yogya, vyaavhaarik kaushal kii aavashyaktaa
 a 2016 World Bank report stated that automation would replace 69 percent of jobs in India - this created the need to train new skills in business schools
 haalanki yah nishchit rup se nai chunautiyaan lekar aata he, lekin yah vibhinn kaushal aavashyaktaaon ke saath nae prakaar kii naukariyon ke avasar bhi saath laata he
 Business schools need to prepare for this on a war footing
 visheshgy aksar shikaayat karte hai ki emb paathyakram bazaar kii vaastaviktaaon ke lihaaj se bahut peeche rah gaye hai
 In addition, in many business schools courses, instead of practical business training, the focus is largely on academic aspects
 eieme kii mahanideshak rekha sethi ne saarvajanik rup se kaha tha ki sarthak internship or placement ke avasaron ke lihaaj se adhikansh bi-skool phiseddi hai
 However, over the years management schools have performed well in terms of imparting practical knowledge to their students in industries during internships
 online prashikshan or internship plateform internshaala ke anusaar, sheersh bijness skulon ke prabandhan snaatakon main pichley saal kii tulana main internship or ausat wajife kii sankhya main vruddhi dekhi gai he
 Another encouraging thing is that there are opportunities for management-related jobs open in some areas which were not previously counted in employment-generating sectors
 udhaaharan ke liye, krishi kshetra main sankat ke baavjood, krishi vyavsaay or khaadya kshetra main prabandhkeey kaushal kii maang bad rahi he
 This is evidenced by the increasing number of students choosing agri-business and rural management as career options in top business schools
 unke paas aisa karne kaa ek kaaran he
 Reputed employers are continuously increasing the salary package of management graduates who are at risk of rural economy
 udhaaharan ke liye, institute of rural management, aanand (irma), jo vartmaan main gramin or krishi-vyavsaay management main kai program karaata he, is vishesh kshetra kii badhati maang ko puraa karne ke liye vartmaan main 360 chaatro kii apni kshamta ko badhaakar 480 karne kii yojana bana rahaa he
 a 36 percent jump in average salary was recorded for the 2019 graduate batch of the institute
 2015 main jahaan yah ausat 8
 4 lakh rupees a year, that increased to 11 in 2019
 5 lakh rupye salanaa ho gaya he
 Another positive trend that is emerging among students is to focus on entrepreneurship rather than finding jobs
 start-ap main haalia oochaal ke saath, bi-skool incubeshan centre sthapit karke udhyamita-vikaas kaaryakramon par ab dhyaan kendrit kar rahe hai
 The India Today survey also found that the number of students showing interest in entrepreneurship has increased since 2014
 haalanki, ye abhi bhi chote kadam hai or bharat main bijness skulon ko bahut bade badlaavon kii aavashyaktaa he
 The ASSOCHAM report found management colleges to be good at improving their infrastructure, training their faculty better, working with industries to improve their credibility, spend money on research and knowledge creation, as well as attract good teachers
 Was advised to pay
 unhen ye sab karnaa chahie, or teji se karnaa chahie
 The survey was conducted by the prestigious Delhi-based market research firm Marketing and Development Research Associates (MDRA) for the 2019 edition of the annual survey of the best business schools for the India Today group
 is prakriya main pijidm diploma yaa emb degree ke liye purnakalik kakshaon main shiksha pradaan karne vaale aise skulon ko soochibaddh kiya gaya tha jinaki sthapana kam se kam paanch saal pehle hui ho or kam se kam teen snaatak batch puure ho chuke hon
 In order to get information from these schools, an objective questionnaire was prepared with the accuracy of getting the latest and most relevant information from various institutions about the various selected standards and sub-standards at every point
 is prashnawali ko emdiare or bijness today kii websiton par prakashit bhi kiya gaya tha
 More than 2,350 business schools across the country fulfilling the participation criteria were contacted through e-mail, telephone and advertisements in magazines and were requested to provide data related to their institution within the stipulated time period
 in prayaason ke falswaroop nirdhaarit samaysima main desh bhar ke maatr 285 sansthaanon ne apane bare main vaanchit swaroop main suchanaaen pradaan kin or ranking ke liye inhen par vichaar kiya gaya
 After obtaining the objective data, every aspect of the information provided by these schools in the first phase of the analysis was examined from the information and database available with MDRA
 iske duusare charan main emdiare shodhakartaaon ne die gaye data kii shuddhta tathaa sateekta sunishchit karne ke liye bhaag lene vaale bijness skulon kaa bhautik satyaapan or audit kiya
 More than 40 business schools were visited by the investigative teams to verify the authenticity of the data
 in dauron main emdiare shodh dal team ne uplabdh karaae gaye data kaa mul dastavejon tathaa vaastavik rup se uplabdh infrastracchar suvidhaon se milan kiya
 The irregularities found during the physical audit were revised to the final objective data
 moolyankan ke paanch maanakon par mili ankon (neeche talika dekhen) ko jod kar prayek santhaan kaa kul vastunishth prapthank nikaala gaya
 MDRA has evaluated these schools on the basis of current year data to provide realistic, updated and accurate information to stakeholders
 is prakriya main bhaag lene vaale bijness skulon ko di gai antim ranking vibhinn sroton—jaise ki santhaan ke pichley data, unki website par di gai jaankaree or antarrashtriya manyata nikaayon—se vibhinn staron par pushti ke baad unhen mili praptankon par aadhaarit thi

 He was immediately rushed to another hospital, where doctors declared him dead

 When Sangeeta's family came to know of this, the ground slipped under her feet
 sangeeta ke pita ne uskebwofrendmadhu ko uski maut kaa jimmedaar tehraaya
 According to him, Madhu was behind Sangeeta for quite some time
 unhen inke bich prem-prasang ke bare main nahin pataa tha
 On the complaint of Sangeeta's father, the police have registered a case under Section 312, 314 and 417 of IPC against Madhu and the abortion doctor
 police is maamle main us hospital kii bhoomika kii bhi jaanch kar rahi he, jahaan sangeeta kaa aborshan kiya gaya
 Addressing the media at a press conference, Interior Minister Rehman Malik of the Government of Pakistan said that India has not submitted any evidence related to the Mumbai attack to us
 jab hamen is bare main saboot milenge to ham is maamle kii puri jaanch karenge or tabhi ajmal kasaab ke bare membhi koi khulaasa kiya jayega
 He said that Pakistan is part of the international community and is ready to cooperate fully with India on this issue
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki agar kisi ne jurm kiya he to ham uske khilaaf jarur karrwai karenge
 He also emphasized that the Government of Pakistan will not take any step which will be against the national interest
 yah puche jane par ki agar bharat apana daawa sabit nahin kar paata to kya pakistan sanyukt raashtra sangh main dobaaraa jaaegi
 He said that Pakistan will not take the matter to the United Nations, but the union that has been banned can go to the United Nations against its ban

 To this, he said, "I will not contest the assembly elections, but if the party gives me a ticket in the Lok Sabha elections, then i will follow its order
" ’’ yah poochne par ki unhone apane putr jayavardhan singh ko raajnneeti kaa kya paath padhaayaa he, singh ne kaha ki raajnneeti padhai nahin jaati
 
 
 It is read by itself
 maine jayavardhan ko itnaa hi kaha ki garmi bahut he or vah juute-mojey ke bajaae sandels pahane to acha rahegaa
 Earlier, addressing the General Assembly, the Congress General Secretary said that he did what he said while being the Chief Minister, this is the character of the Congress, but what the BJP says, it does not do
 unhone mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan par aarope lagaaya ki vah kendra sarkaar kii yojanaon kaa jhootha shrey lene ke aadi ho chuke hai

 What never happened in the history of Cricket World Cup was seen on the Lord's ground in England on Sunday
 cricket kii janak kahe jane vaali england team ne newjiland ko haraakar pehali baar is khitaab ko apane naam kiya to vahiin duusari taraf unhen yah jeet jis andaaj main mili vaisaa bhi kabhi kisi world cap final match main dekhne ko nahin mila
 The match was a super over after the tie and the scores of both the teams were stuck on par even in the super over, despite England's team becoming the super champion
 mejabaan team ko yah taj isisi ke niyamon kii vajah se mila he, jo kahata he ki agar super over main bhi match taai ho jaae to zyada jis team kii pari main zyada boundry hoti hai, use hi vijeta maan liya jaataa he
 In this sense, England scored a total of 26 boundaries in their 50-over innings and super overs, including 24 fours and two sixes
 jabaki newjiland ne super samet apni pari main kul 17 boundry hi laga paaya
 Understand, after winning the toss in the mathematicslords field, New Zealand captain Kane Williamson decided to bat first and scored 241 runs, losing 8 wickets while playing 50 overs
 newjiland ne apni pari main 14 chauke or 2 chakke lagaae
 In this way, he scored 68 runs with the help of boundary
 vahiin, super over main newjiland kii taraf se sirf ek boundry lag pai, jab jimi nisham ne chakka lagaaya
 That is, New Zealand put together a total of 17 (14 fours, 3 sixes) boundaries in their 50-over innings and super
 is tarah boundry ke sahare ne newjiland ne kul 74 ran banaae
 On the other hand, the fiery style of the English batsmen became the reason for his victory
 newjiland 241 ranon ke score kaa peechha karte hue england ke jin ballebaajon ne bhi ran banaae usamen jamkar boundry lagaayee
 Jason Roy, Ben Stokes, Joss Butler and Bairstow's brilliant batting helped England to a total of 22 fours and 2 sixes in their 50-over innings
 jabaki do chauke ben stokes or jos butler ne super over main lagaae
 In this way, England made a total of 26 boundaries (24 fours, 2 sixes) in their entire innings, including the super over and with the help of 108 runs
 yani boundry lagaakar england ke ballebaajon ne kul 108 ran batore, jabaki newjiland kii team mahaj 74 hi bana pai yani boundry ke lihaaj se dekha jaae to yah antar 34 ranon kaa rahaa
 However, the real reason for the victory was the ICC rule which states that the team who has the most boundaries in his innings is declared the winner after the match is tied in the Super Over also
 is tarah england pehali baar world cap jeetne main kaamyaab ho gaya

 Former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh and former Union Minister Uma Bharti has expressed reservations over coming up with independent MLA Gopal Kanda to form the government in Haryana and requested the party to keep only the well-to-do with them
 unhone kaha ki haryana main hamaari sarkaar zarur bane, lekin yah tay kariye ki jaise bhartiya janata party ke kaaryakarta saafe-suthere zindagi ke hote hai, hamaare saath vaise hi log hon

 Uma Bharti said that as long as there was no Modi wave, we used to be happy even winning two assembly seats in Haryana
 isliye haryana main pehle chunaav main sarkaar bana lenaa or duusare chunaav main bhi sabase badi party banakar aana asaadhaaran uplabdhi he
 All this is the result of austerity of Narendra Modi ji

 agar gopal kanda vahi vyakti he jisaki vajah se ek ladki ne aatmahatya kii thi tathaa uski maan ne bhi nyaay nahin milane par aatmahatya kar lee thi, maamla abhi court main vichaaradhin he, tathaa yah vyakti zamaanat par baahar he

 yahaan tivi nahin he
 i am taking all the news on mobile
 mujhe jaankaree mili he ki ham haryana main bhi sarkaar bana sakate hai
 This is a good news

 There are many factors in winning an election

 Uma Bharti wrote that Gopal Kanda is innocent or a criminal, it will be decided on the basis of evidence, but winning his election does not acquit him of crimes
 chunaav jeetne ke bahut saare factor hote hai
 Uma Bharti wrote to the party, "I will request the BJP not to forget our moral establishment

 Some things that were clearly understood in the interview with Kiran Bedi are that they have no solid reason for joining BJP
 unase thos kaaran baar-baar poochne kii vajah ye ki kai kaaryakramon main unhone kai baar kaha ki raajnneeti main wo bilkul nahin aana chaahatin
 He even went on to say in ndtv's program Muqbala in April 2014 that at least three years of training is necessary before joining politics
 lekin achaanak unka hryday parivartan kyon hua or unhone bijepi kaa daaman kyon thama is baat kaa unke paas koi logical jawaab nahin he
 Repeatedly, because of the new government, there has been a lot of enthusiasm due to Narendra Modi, but what has he done in eight months, the government has no such answer as the anti-arrogant people like him
 isse yahi lagata he ki jo daanv bijepi ne un par lagaaya he, vahi daanv unhone bhi bijepi par lagaaya he
 Why did you not go in, i asked, never thought to leave and i will not tell you the reason behind it
 jab aam aadmi party ke aaropon ke bare main poocha jaataa he to use bhi taal jaati hai, kehete hue ki maine aarope liya nahin to wo laga kaise? or ye bhi ki wo kisi aarope kaa jawaab nahin dengi
 Perhaps he realizes that if he keeps on answering the allegations then there is more possibility of getting trapped
 isiilie gini chuni line bolne main hi bhalaai he

 It also said that the language in the assembly will be decent, people will not speak without proof
 ye kis chiz kaa dar bol rahaa he? When it came to giving Delhi a separate statehood and the Delhi Police being with the Delhi government, it clearly said that there is no need for it
 abhi jo he, jaise he, vaise hi kaam chalegaa
 That is, they have not said anything clearly what Delhi has been asking for a long time
 poochne par ye bhi bataa diya ki anna se ab tak baat nahin hui he
 And yes, the bjp's leadership has to deal with the tone of protest in Delhi BJP

 pichley chunaav main donon partiyon ke bich kareeb-kareeb barabari kaa muqabla tha
 This time the reputation of both BJP and Congress is at stake in the political battlefield of central Gujarat
 sahakaari sansthaaon or dugdh utpaadan ke liye mashhoor madhya gujarat main is baar bijepi kila bachaane to congress send lagane main juty he
 This is the reason that while the BJP has confidence in the urban voters of central Gujarat, Rahul is dreaming of victory with the help of the villagers of this area
 madhya gujarat ke is baar muddemadhya gujarat main patidaar aarakshan andolan kaa mudda yahaan pramukh he, berogari-kaarobaar par asar jwalanth, kisaanon kii karjamaafee kaa mudda chaaya hua he
 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is raising issues like unemployment, GST and demonetisation prominently to surround the BJP
 2012 ke chunavi nattejeygujarat kii kul 182 vidhansabha siton main se madhya gujarat main 40 vidhansabha siten he
 In the last election 2012, there has been a fight between the two parties
 madhya gujarat kii 40 siton main se 22 par bijepi ne jeet darj kii or congress ko 18 siten hasil kii thim
 While the BJP dominated the urban seats, the Congress managed to win the rural seats
 vadodara jile ke dam par bijepi aage nikal gai
 But this time the political atmosphere has changed
 is baar kaarobaariyon main thodi naaraazgi dekhne ko mil rahi he
 Demonetisation and GST issue
 agar ye vadodara or ahmedabad jaise jilon main jiesti or notebandi apana asar dikhaata he to chunavi nattejey chaunkaane vaale ho sakate hai
 The bjp's stronghold, ahmedabad-vadodaramadhy, Gujarat consists of Ahmedabad, Dahod, Kheda, Anand, Panchmahal, Vadodara districts
 inamen se ahmedabad or vadodara bijepi kaa majboot garh he
 Both these districts are in the urban area
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon kii baat karen to ahmedabad kii kul 21 vidhansabha siton main se 17 bijepi ne jeetin jabaki congress ko mahaj 4 siten milin
 Out of the 13 seats in Vadodara, BJP won 10 seats while Congress got 2 and 1 seat in the account of others
 gramin ilaakon main congress kaa dabadabbahmadabad or vadodara ko chhod diya jaae to madhya gujarat ke gramin ilaake vaala kshetra congress ke dabadabe vaala mana jaataa he
 Five districts of Dahod, Kheda, Anand, Panchmahal have more rural population than the seven districts of central Gujarat
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main in jilon main yaa to congress kaa palada baari rahaa yaa phir muqabla baraabar kaa rahaa he
 The Congress got 5 seats in the 7 assembly seats of Kheda district of central Gujarat, while the BJP got just 2
 aanand jile kii 7 vidhansabha siton main congress ko 4, bijepi ko 2 or anya ko 1 seat mili
 Of the 6 seats in Dahod, 3 were won by BJP and 3 by Congress
 panchmahal jile main 7 siten hai, jinamein se bijepi ko 4 to congress ko 3 siten milin thi
 Demonetisation has become a headache for BJP
 For two decades, most of Patel's support has been with BJP, but this time the issue of Patidar reservation movement will have an impact on the results here
 patidaaron kii naaraazgi ko dekhte hue bijepi ne pichhadi jati ke thakor or coli samudaay se ummid lagaae hue he
 Congress has been winning seats in rural areas, but this time it is eyeing urban voters to return to power
 mechap kii galat parat aapke luk ko bigaad sakati he
 In such a situation, it is very important to choose good makeup to look good
 khaastaur par chehre kaa base bahut mahatvapurn hota he
 Makeup artist Analia Himomi says, 'every skin is different
 fere, lite or medium skin ke liye foundation bhi alag hote hai
 Even after this, the foundation of dry, oily and combination skin is different
 to in sab main bhi sahi base kaa chunaav jaruri he
 'they say that it is not right to use powder for dry skin
 unhone bataaya, 'kriim yaa liquid foundation dry skin ke liye parfect he
 Apply it on the face with the help of damp sponges
 isse ye puure chehre par achche se lagegaa
 'women with normal skin may also apply cream or liquid foundation
 ise bhi nam sponge se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Press powder can then be used to give the foundation the correct base
 isse foundation lambey samay tak chehre par bana rahegaa
 If you have oily skin, apply the foundation on the face with a stippling brush and then apply the powder to the finish

 The 29 students, who have held their principal and some other teachers hostage in a school room for more than 21 hours, have finally freed the teachers after the authorities have promised that their answer books will be double checked
 haalanki skool kii adhyapikaon ne naam na chaape jane kii shart par kaha ki fail ho chuki chaatraon kii uttarpustikaayen dobaaraa jaanche jane kaa faisla galat udhaaharan pesh karegaa, or yah kaaphi apmanjanak bhi he
 The problem started at around three o'clock in the afternoon on Monday, when 29 girls who failed in the 12th grade pre-board examination of Rishi Arvindo Balika Vidyalaya, South Kolkata, surrounded their Principal Mrs
 Ghosh and some other teachers and locked them in a room
 Locked
 chaatraon kii maang thi ki unhen pre-board pariksha main uteern hone laayak ank die jaaen, or board kii pariksha main baithne diya jaae
 This examination was done by 105 girl students of this school, out of which 76 passed
 fail hone vaali chaatraon kaa aarope he ki unhen galat tareeke se number die gaye, or inamen se kuch ke mata-pita ne bhi apni bacchiyon kaa saath diya
 After this, Principal Mrs
 Ghosh had said that these girls will not be passed on behalf of the school, unless the higher officials of the State Board of Education order them to do so
 pradhanacharya ne rajya ke shikshaamantri karyaalay sahit sabhi sambandhit adhikariyon ko phone ke jariye maamle kii puri jaankaree de di thi, lekin shikshaamantri ne bhi hastkshep nahin kiya tha
 The police also reached the school on Monday itself, and stood outside all night, but they too had not taken any action against the girl students
 mangalvaar purvahn 11 baje pashchim bengal hair secondary council ke do adhikari skool pahunche or pradhanacharya tathaa adhyapikaon ke saath baithak kii, jiske lagbhag ek ghante baad hair secondary council ke sachiv achintya paal ne ghoshnaa kii ki fail kii gai chaatraon kii uttarpustikaayen dobaaraa janchi jaaengi, or tay kiya jayega ki inamen se kitni chaatraon ko uteern hone laayak number die ja sakate hai
 All the failed girls were asked to reach the council office on Wednesday at 11:30 am
 chatraayen bhi is par sahamat ho gayi, or unhone apni shikshikaaon ko azaad kar diya
 The comments sara maamla nipatane ke baad haalanki achintya paal ne daawa kiya ki is maamle ko pradhanacharya ke adhikaron ko kam nahin kiya gaya he, lekin pradhanacharya shrimati ghosh tathaa anya adhyapikaon ne kaha ki council kaa yah faisla apmanjanak he, tathaa isse galat udhaaharan pesh hoga
 In fact, as soon as these students of class 12 liberated the teachers, at the same time it was told that students of class 10 are also demanding a re-examination of their answer books
 is puure maamle ko shikshavidon ne katai galat bataaya he
 It has been learned that even before this, the principals of colleges etc
 have been besieged by the students for their demands, but this is unprecedented in a school
 samasya somvaar ko dopaher baad lagbhag teen baje shuru hui thi, jab dakshini kolkata ke rishi aravindo balika vidhyalay kii 12veen kaksha kii pre-board pariksha main fail hone vaali 29 chaatraon ne apni pradhanacharya shrimati ghosh or kuch anya shikshakon ko gherkar ek kamare main band kar taala laga diya
 The students demanded that they should be given marks worth passing the pre-board examination, and to be allowed to appear in the board examination
 yah pariksha is skool kii 105 chaatraon ne di thi, jinamein se 76 paas ho gai thim
 The students who failed failed to allege that they were given incorrect numbers, and some of their parents also supported their daughters
 iske baad pradhanacharya shrimati ghosh ne kaha tha ki in chaatraon ko skool kii ore se paas nahin kiya jayega, jab tak rajya shiksha board ke ucchadhikari unhen aisa karne kaa aadesh nahin dete
 The Principal had given complete information about the matter via phone to all the concerned officials including the State Education Minister's Office, but the Education Minister also did not interfere
 police bhi somvaar ko hi skool pahunch gai thi, or sari raat baahar khadi rahi, lekin unhone bhi chaatraon ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kii thi
 At 11 am on Tuesday, two officers of the West Bengal Higher Secondary Council arrived at the school and held a meeting with the Principal and the teachers, nearly an hour after Achintya Pal, Secretary of the Higher Secondary Council announced that the failed girls' answerbooks would be rechecked, and It will be decided how many of these girls can be given passable numbers
 sabhi fail hui chaatraon se buudhvaar purvahn 11:30 baje council karyaalay main pahunchane ke liye kaha gaya
 The students also agreed to this, and they liberated their teachers
 tippaniyan After dealing with the whole case, however, Achintya Pal claimed that the Principal's rights had not been curtailed in the matter, but Principal Mrs
 Ghosh and other teachers said that the Council's decision was outrageous, and would set a wrong precedent
 darasal, jaise hi 12veen kaksha kii in chaatraon ne shikshikaaon ko azaad kiya, usee vakt bataaya gaya ki 10veen kaksha kii chatraayen bhi apni uttarpustikaon kii dobaaraa jaanch karaane kii maang kar rahi hai
 This whole matter has been described by academics as completely wrong
 jaankaree mili he ki isse pehle bhi chaatr-chaatraon dwaara apni maangon ko lekar collejon ke principal aadi kaa gheraav kiya jaataa rahaa he, lekin kisi skool main aisa kiya janaa abhootpurv he
 After this, Principal Mrs
 Ghosh had said that these girls will not be passed on behalf of the school, unless the higher officials of the State Board of Education order them to do so
 pradhanacharya ne rajya ke shikshaamantri karyaalay sahit sabhi sambandhit adhikariyon ko phone ke jariye maamle kii puri jaankaree de di thi, lekin shikshaamantri ne bhi hastkshep nahin kiya tha

 Students of economically backward general category will not be able to get the benefit of 10% upper caste quota in the academic session 2019-20 in Maharashtra
 medical va post graduate collejon main daakhilon ke liye is saal yah kota lagu nahin kiya jayega
 The Supreme Court has refused to give 10 per cent reservation to upper caste students

 The Supreme Court said that if the upper caste reservation is implemented then the entire process of admission will be affected
 supreme court ne kaha ki aarthik taur par pichde savarnon ko admician main chhot dene ke liye pehle siton kii sankhya bhi badhaai jaani chahie
 The Supreme Court while hearing the upper caste reservation has issued an interim order in this regard
 maharashtra sarkaar ne savarna aarakshan ke khilaaf daakhil yachika ko khaarij karne kii apil kii thi
 The Supreme Court said that if the benefit of reservation is being given to economically backward upper castes, then within the stipulated time, the number of seats should also be increased in other post graduate colleges including medical colleges, which is not possible to increase in this session
 
 isliye savarna aarakshan ko is satr ke liye lagu nahin kiya janaa chahie

 He said that his speech was not in the context of science
 maaloom ho ki bijepi netaa hemanth biswa saramaane kaha tha ki kuch log cancer jaisi ghaatak bimariyon se isliye grast hai, kyonki unhone ateet main paap kiye hai or yah ishwar kaa nyaay he

 However, the medical superintendent of the state's cancer institute, Dr

 jai hind The accusation of the Central Government's decision to divide Ghulam Nabi Azad Kashmir, India was beheaded, many of the opposition parties including Congress, RJD are opposing the historic decision of the Narendra Modi government on Jammu and Kashmir
 jammu-kashmir ke purv mukhyamantri or congress ke senior leader gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki aaj kaa din bhartiya itihaas kaa kaala din he
 The BJP government abolished 35A with Article 370 in a jolt to gain power and vote
 iske saath khilwaad kar yah bahut badi gaddari kar rahe hai
 Speaking outside Parliament, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said that lakhs of people sacrificed in Kashmir in the last 70 years
 jab-jab bhi rajya main aatankwaad kaa bolbalaa rahaa tab bhi unhone ladaai ladi
 The people of Kashmir and mainstream political parties also countered terrorism
 aatankwaad kaa muqabla surakshabalon ne bhi kiya
 The Modi government abolished the privileges granted to Jammu and Kashmir in 370, drunk with the President's approval, BJP Gulam Nabi Azad said, 'in one stroke, the BJP government has given a full state to get its drunk power vote
 Culture is, civilization, different by geographical area, different at the political level, different in history, Ladakh in which Muslims and Buddhists live, Kashmiri Which are Muslim and live Pandit and Sikh live
 jammu main jahaan 60 fisadi hindu aabaadi he, 40 fisadi muslim aabaadi he
 Sikh population
 agar yahaan logon ko kisi ne baandh kar rakhaa tha to anuchhed 370 ne rakhaa tha
 The black chapter of democracy, Nabi Azad, said that Article 370 had separate provisions in all three areas, but the BJP abolished all three things in one stroke
 ise hindustan ke itihaas main kaale adhyay ke taur par likhaa jayega
 Ghulam Nabi Azad said, 'along with Article 370, Article 35-A was also abolished
 uske saath jaisaa ki itnaa kaaphi nahin tha rajya ko barbaad karne ke liye, rajya ko vibhajit kar diya
 Made Ladakh a union territory
 jammu or kashmir ko centre shasit pradesh bana diya
 Jammu Kashmir will not have a Governor, it will now be the Deputy Governor
 yah kabhi sapane main nahin sochaa gaya tha
 The NDA government has ended the existence of Jammu and Kashmir
 kashmir se judaa Article 370 sthaayee he yaa asthaayee? jaane samvidhan visheshgyon kii rigulam nabi aaazaad ne chetavanee dete hue kaha ki inhone rajya ko vibhajit to kar diya he lekin inhen nahin pataa ki bharat ke saamne ek taraf se china ke saath lanbaa border he
 There is a long wide border with Pakistan
 pioke ke saath jammu-kashmir kii seemaa he
 How will India deal with them? loktantr ke saath hua khilavaadgulam nabi aaazaad ne naaraazgi jataate hue kaha ki loktantr ke saath khilwaad kiya gaya he
 The state is played with unity and integrity
 yah desh ke saath bahut badi gaddari he
 Whenever Pakistan and China have attacked, the people of Kashmir have always been in the front
 1947 main jab hamalaa hua tha, fouj ke aane se pehle kashmir ke naujavaanon, auraton or bacchon ne ladaai ladi
 The intruders with lathis were stopped by the workers and leaders
 gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki kisi border state main keval fouj ke saath dushman ko nahin roak sakate
 The support of the local people is also necessary
 logon ko rajantik str par khatm kiya gaya
 Economically abolished
 desh kaa sir kashmir tha jise bhartiya janata party kii sarkaar ne kaat liya he
 Know the history of 35A, after all, why did Jawalabina head into India in Jammu and Kashmir! Ghulam Nabi Azad said that today there is India without a head
 kashmir desh kaa mastak tha
 Today the head of the country was beheaded
 desh ko kamjor ko khatm kar diya gaya he
 Has been played with democracy
 kashmir se kanyakumari tak jo bhi dharmanirpeksh partiyaan hai, unhen kashmir ke logon ke saath khadaa hona chahie
 Ghulam Nabi Azad said that Kashmir has been divided into pieces
 unhone centre sarkaar par aarope lagaaya ki rajyasabha main vipakshi partiyon ke netaaon kii bite nahin prasaarit kii jaati he

 Today was the last day of the United Nations General Assembly held in New York every year
 74veen aam sabha main koob bhaashan hue
 In this five-day speech, what kind of concerns are emerging from the speech of the President or Prime Minister of the countries of the world, how much resolution is there in the resolution of those speeches or how much is the formality of speech, how much is honesty, in terms of Speeches should be seen only then we will be able to understand what the speech means in the General Assembly of the United Nations
 kashmir ke nazariye se dekhen to aam sabha main is par iran yaa yaman kii tarah charchaa nahin hui or na zikr hua
 There is a speech in the general assembly from nine in the day to nine in the night
 jaise 27 sitambar ko hi 37 deshon ke pramukhon kaa bhaashan hoga
 The speech was initiated by Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez
 gutereyz ne kaha ki duniya main takaraav ke kai kshetra ban gaye hai jin par turant dhyaan dena zaruri he lekin unhone kashmir kaa zikr nahin kiya
 Syria, Korea, Sudan, Afghanistan and Venezuela must be named
 ye wo samasyaayein jo apana rup badal leti hai magar samaadhaan nahin hota he
 Today the speech of Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi took place and also Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan
 bangladesh or nepal ke pramukh kaa bhi bhaashan hoga
 It is obvious that the speeches of the heads of the countries of South Asia should be closely watched for what they are worried about in these areas
 unke paas nayaa idia kya he or kya saahasik kadam uthaane ja rahe hai
 The United Nations has five permanent members
 china, rus, britain, america or france
 Speeches have been made by the heads of America, Britain and France
 27 sitambar ko china or rus kaa bhaashan he
 India did not even mention the tensions of Pakistan in the speeches of the heads of America, Britain and France
 inke pramukh madhya asia ke desh iran, yaman or saudi arab ko lekar hi baat karte rahe
 The President of France appeared worried about America and Iran
 yaman ke sankat kii samaapti kii baat kar rah the
 President Trump of America has received so many statements on Kashmir that there is confusion as to what his line is
 magar trump ne bhi sanyukt raashtra kii aam sabha main jo bhaashan diya usamen bharat pakistan yaa kashmir kaa zikr tak nahin kiya
 It is not that terrorism is not an issue for them, Trump called Iran the world's largest terrorist country but did not even take notice in his speech of India's diplomacy to surround Pakistan on this issue
 iran ke hasan ruhani ne saaf-saaf kah diya ki vah apane shatru desh se baat nahin karegaa
 We will not talk under any pressure
 iran aarthik aatankwaad kaa saamana kar rahaa he or majbooti se muqabla kar rahaa he
 Iran, a friend of the US, has criticized Iran
 france ke raashtrapati mancron or german chancelar angila markil ne kaha ki america or iran ke bich samvaad hona chahie
 World leaders lack courage
 unhen javabdehi leni hogi or shanti kaayam kerani hogi
 Brazilian President Bolsenaro went on to say that the Amazon forest is not the lungs of the earth and that the burning of the forests was exaggerated
 turki ke raashtrapati erdogan ne kaha ki parmaanu shaktiyon or gair parmaanu shaktiyon main bhedbhaav mitna chahie
 The nuclear powers should be completely banned or the field should be open for everyone
 erdogan ne kaha he ki kashmir kii samasya kaa samaadhaan baatcheet honi chahie
 Turkey is the only country that has supported Pakistan
 israel ne turki ko jhootha kaha he
 Turkey has massacred the Kurds themselves
 colombia ke raashtrapati ne kaha ki vah venezuela kii carguzariyon ke khilaaf dastauez saunpega
 Everyone is talking about each other's violence, war and genocide
 bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi 2014, 2015 ke baad 2019 main yani teesri baar aam sabha main bhaashan de rahe the
 In his first speech of 2014, Prime Minister Modi said that the United Nations should reform
 20veen sadi kii zaruuraton ke hisaab se bane sanghathan ko 21veen sadi main praasangik nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 If changes are not made and this improvement should happen by 2015
 suraksha parishad kaa vistaar 2019 tak nahin hua he
 In his first speech, Prime Minister Modi referred to the restoration of democracy in Nepal, Bhutan and Tunisia
 africa or latin america kaa bhi zikr tha
 Then he had said about Pakistan that he was ready for serious talks with Pakistan in an atmosphere of peace free from the shadow of terror
 iske liye pakistan ko bhi maahaul banane main madad kerani hogi
 In the 2014 speech, the Prime Minister also said that at this time, he is engaged in helping the flood victims in Jammu and Kashmir and has also offered help in Pak Occupied Kashmir
 2014 se lekar 2019 ke bich na wo maahaul bana or na baatcheet hui
 Listen to part of the speech this time
 pradhanmantri kaa bhaashan swatchta or ayushmaan, aadhaar, jandhan yojana ke asar se shuru hota he na ki media ke anusaar kashmir kashmir se
 But he did not mention Kashmir, he called for a ban on single use plastic and talked about constructing 1
5 lakh km of roads in villages and connecting 15 crore houses with tap
 bharat ko tibi mukt karne ke lakshya kii baat kii
 In his speech, the Prime Minister also mentioned how he has formed the Solar Alliance at the international level
 prakritik aapadaa ko lekar global alliance banane kii zarurat he
 Said that India will be the leading country in solving the climate crisis
 uma shankar singh neuyark se apni tippanee bhej rahe hai
 The Prime Minister's speech was free from Kashmir, the world was calling for welfare
 unhone pakistan ko bhi nishaanaa nahin banaaya lekin pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan pradhanmantri se lekar aresas tak ko nishaanaa banaaya
 The United Nations forum was used against Prime Minister Modi
 gujarat dangon se lekar sangh ke agenda ke bare main baat kii
 The issue of climate crisis before Kashmir said that its glaciers are melting
 amir deshon main bane tex hewan vikasshil deshon ko lut rahe hai or garib banaate ja rahe hai
 After that Imran also mentioned the fear and perception being spread against Muslims across the world and said that Islamophobia has increased after the September 11 terrorist attack
 pashchim ke kuch deshon or netaaon ne is islamophobia ko failaayaa he jise rokane main yaa samajhane main muslim deshon ke netaa bhi naakaam rahe
 Terror has nothing to do with religion
 sabhi samudaayon main radical tatv hai
 But they have nothing to do with their religion
 bataaya ki afghanistan ke liye mujahid group ko pashchim ke paise se pakistan ne trend kiya jinhen soviet aatanki kehete hai or pakistan unhen swatantraaa senaanee kahata he
 Now West is calling them terrorists
 imran bataate rahe ki satta main aane ke baad in sanghathanon ko dhwast karenge, pehle bhi kaha gaya tha ki magar wo sanghathan bane rahe
 Imran said that the United Nations should send its observer and see what action Pakistan has taken against these militant organizations
 jaahir he bharat is safai se santusht nahin hoga
 Imran said that soon after coming to power, he extended his hand towards India but later called Prime Minister Modi as President Modi and later reformed it
 sanyukt raashtra main netaaon kii chintaa main unki apni chhavi he, shakti pramukh dikhne kii betaabi he, kootneeti he jalwaayu sankat kii chintaa kam kam he
 But the specialty of this conference was that common people have tried to address the climate crisis
 america, china or bharat duniya ke teen sabase bade carbon pradooshan failaane vaale desh maane jate hai
 They are very disappointed
 jalwaayu sammelan main un deshon ne zyada kamitment dikhaaya he jo jalwaayu sankat ke khatre kii chapet main hai
 There is more restlessness in island countries because if the sea level rises, then these countries will drown
 70 chote deshon ne zyada kathor vaada kiya he ki ve jaldi carbon utsarjan khatm kar denge
 The Marshall Island president has said that by 2050 carbon emissions will be eliminated
 is tarah kaa vaada kisi ne nahin kiya
 On Friday, 28 countries demonstrated in the climate crisis

 i got an offer to become an MP 5 times but i turned it down
 kyonki main ek filmmekar hum or raajnneeti meraa kaam nahin he
 "vivek said-" The entire team is sad and disappointed with the film's release postponed
 hamen bahut ummiden thim
 It took a year and a half to make the film and we were excited
 magar jab relies hone se ek din pehle movie ko roak diya jaataa he to dukh hota he
 If our movie affects voters, then people can also be influenced by advertisements, political views, editorials

 After watching the Election Commission's film, Vivek said in a conversation with the media- "people present in the Election Commission have seen the film
 main unki film ko lekar pratikriya ko share nahin kar saktaa hum, lekin main unke jawaab se khush tha
 There is only one request that the film should be released
 "bataa den, chunaav ayog ke roak lagane ke baad piem narendra modi kaa trailor utyub se bhi hataa diya gaya
 Vivek Oberoi plays the role of PM Narendra Modi in the movie
 film kaa nirdesan omang kumaar ne kiya he
 Sandeep Singh, Suresh Oberoi and Anand Pandit have produced the movie
 apni beti kii maut ke dedh maheene baad mumbai kaa pai parivaar unki beti kii maut ke liye jimmedaar logon kaa pataa lagane ke liye police ke paas guhaar lekar ek baar phir se ahmedabad aayaa he
 In fact, on May 13, 37-year-old Manjula Pai, about 8 in the morning
 30 baje ahmedabad ke rajpath club ke thik saamne se ja rahi thi, tabhi kisi vaahan ne use joardaar takkar maari
 She was badly injured in the accident and then someone from the road called an ambulance and rushed her to the hospital
 manjula ahmedabad ke centre for anvyrement ajukeshan main bataur librorian kaam karti thi
 Just a day before the incident, the entire family was holidaying together in Haridwar
 manjula ke mata-pita or bahan ko mumbai kii train kaa tikat mil gaya tha, isliye wo log raat ko train se nikle the
 But Manjula was not able to get a train ticket to Ahmedabad, so she reached Ahmedabad last night by plane and this incident happened to her while going to office in the morning
 yuvati kaa parivaar train main raste main abhi bhopal tak hi pahunchaa tha ki is durghatana kii khabar unako mili
 The family flew from Bhopal to reach Taburtad Ahmedabad
 unka puraa dhyaan apni beti ko bachaane main hi rahaa
 His family hoped that the police were investigating the matter seriously, so those responsible would be caught
 lekin uske parivaar ko gujarati bhashaa nahin aati thi, isliye bhashaa kii bhi unhen vahaan takalif hui
 When the doctors replied that there was no longer any chance for her daughter to escape, the family donated her eyes and lever to other individuals as Manjula wished so that someone else's life could be saved
 uskaa antim sanskaar kar parivaar mumbai chalaa gaya or intazaar karata rahaa ki police kii ore se jaanch kii koi khabar aegi, lekin aisa kuch nahin hua
 They have now received information that the police have closed the case long ago, saying that they have not been able to find any evidence in this case
 ab vah parivaar insaaf kii maang ko lekar dobaaraa ahmedabad pahunchaa he
 The family alleges that it is not possible that no one has seen, because in the morning there is a huge crowd on this road
 aarope ye bhi he ki ye ghatana thik rajpath club ke thik saamne hui, iske baavjood sisitivi footage kyon nahin mil rahaa he
 Rajpath Club is one of the biggest clubs in Ahmedabad, yet why are the police saying that they have not been able to find CCTV footage
 parivaar ko yah bhi aarope he ki aamtaur par sofesticated club hone ke baavjood usee vakt kaa sisitivi footage kyon muhaiyaa nahin ho paaya he
 But the police say that so far no witness has appeared in this case
 police ne rajpath club ko sisitivi footage kii maang ko lekar ek patr bhi likhaa tha, lekin vahaan se jawaab aayaa ki us din unke sarwar main kharabi ho jane kii vajah se unke paas koi sisitivi footage uplabdh nahin he
 The comments parivaar kaa maananaa he ki police agar is maamle kii gambhirtha se jaanch karti, to wo duusari jagahon se bhi sisitivi footage le sakati thi, lekin wo is maamle kii jaanch ke liye sanjeeda nahin he
 It is not just about the police, but also the people of the society that a woman gets into an accident on the road, she dies, but not a single person comes forward to testify
 darasal, 13 may ko 37 saal kii manjula pai subah kareeb 8
 She was going right in front of Rajpath Club in Ahmedabad at 30 pm when a vehicle hit her
 is durghatana main vah buree tarah ghayal ho gai or tabhi sadak se hi kisi ne ambulance ko bulaayaa or use aspataal le jaaya gaya
 Manjula worked as a librarian at the Center for Environment Education, Ahmedabad
 ghatana se thik ek din pehle puraa parivaar ek saath haridwar main chhuttiyaan manaa rahaa tha
 Manjula's parents and sister had got a train ticket to Mumbai, so they left the train at night
 lekin manjula ko ahmedabad kaa train kaa tikat nahin mil paaya tha, isliye vah hawaiyatra se pichhali raat hi ahmedabad pahunchi thi or subah daftar jate vakt uske saath yah haadasa ho gaya
 The family of the girl had just reached Bhopal on the way on the train that she got the news of this accident
 parivaar bhopal se hawaiyatra kar tabadatod ahmedabad pahunchaa
 His entire focus was on saving his daughter
 uske parivaar waalon ko yah ummid thi ki police is maamle kii gambhirtha se jaanch kar rahi he, isliye zimmedaar log pakade jaaenge
 But his family did not know Gujarati language, so he also had trouble with the language
 jab doctoron ne jawaab de diya ki ab unki beti kii bachane kii koi gunjaaish nahin he, tab manjula kii ichha ke mutabik parivaar ne uski ankhen or liver anya vyaktiyon ko donnet kar die taaki kisi or kii zindagi bachaai ja sake
 After his last rites, the family moved to Mumbai and waited for any news of investigation from the police, but nothing happened
 ab unhen jaankaree mili he ki police ne to bahut pehle hi yah maamla band kar diya he, yah kehete hue ki unhen is maamle main koi saboot nahin mil paaya he
 Now that family has returned to Ahmedabad again demanding justice
 parivaar kaa aarope he ki ye sambhav hi nahin he ki kisi ne dekha na ho, kyonki subah ke vakt is road par baari bheed hoti he
 It is also alleged that this incident happened right in front of the Rajpath Club, why is CCTV footage not being found
 rajpath club ahmedabad ke sabase badi klbon main se ek he, phir bhi police yah kyon kah rahi he ki unhen sisitivi footage nahin mila paaya he
 The family is also alleged to have been unable to provide CCTV footage of the same time, despite being a couch-clubbed club
 lekin police kaa kahana he ki ab tak koi bhi gavaah is maamle main saamne nahin aayaa he
 The police had also written a letter to the Rajpath club seeking CCTV footage, but the reply came from there that they did not have any CCTV footage available due to a malfunction in their server that day
 tippaniyan The family believes that if the police had investigated the matter seriously, it could have taken CCTV footage from other places as well, but it is not ready to investigate the matter
 baat sirf police kii nahin, samaaj ke logon kii bhi he ki bhari sadak par ek mahila ke saath haadasa ho jaataa he, uski maut ho jaati he, lekin gavaahi dene ke liye ek bhi vyakti saamne nahin aata he
