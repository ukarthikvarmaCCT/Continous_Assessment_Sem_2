 India does not have a single university in the top 300 list of the World University Rankings 2020
 2012 ke baad aisa pehali baar hua he jab bharat kii koi bhi uniwarsity is list main jagah nahin bana pai he
 However, in the overall ranking (global University Rankings 2020), the number of Indian universities is more this time than last year
 2018 main jahaan 49 sansthaanon ne is suchi main sthaan mila tha, vahiin is baar 56 sansthaanon ko sthaan mila he
 Indian Institute of Science (iisc) Bangalore has ranked in the top 350 of India
 duusari ore bhartiya praudyogiki santhaan (IIT) ropar bhi is baar top 350 ranking main pahunch gaya he
 The rankings of some have improved, including IIT Delhi, IIT Kharagpur and Jamia Millia

 Imran Khan, who had been aspiring to play cricket and gun in Paradise since childhood, will now become the next Prime Minister of Pakistan
 buudhvaar ko pakistan main hue aam chunaav main imran khan kii pakistan taharik-e-insaaf party sabase bade raajnneetik dal ke rup main ubhari he
 Emraan Khan, who came out of the cricket field and entered politics from the corridor of the hospital, has started discussing the picture of his 'new Pakistan' before the public
 khaskar kashmir, aatankwaad or bharat ke mudde par imran khan kii raay kaaphi ahm he
 He is often seen speaking against India, and many times talking to his country to end terrorism and befriend India
 imran khan apni jeevani ‘pakistan: a personal history’ main bhi apane sapanom ke pakistan kii tasviir khinchi he
 In it, he has also mentioned his Islamic identity and spiritual world
 aaie kashmir, aatankwaad, loktantr or bharat samet tamaam muddon par imran khan kii raay jaanate hai
 
 
 
 pakistan se aatankwaad kaa khaatmaa karne ke pakshadharaimran khan ne saat disambar 2012 ko agenda ajtak kaarykram main hissaa liya tha, jisamen unhone pichley chunaav ko lekar vaada kiya tha ki agar unki sarkaar banati he, to 90 din ke andar pakistan se aatankwaad kaa khaatmaa kar diya jayega
 There will be no room for panic in the new Pakistan
 bharat ke khilaaf aatankwaad ke liye pakistan kii jameen kaa istemaal nahin karne diya jayega
 He also promised that Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the Mumbai attack, would not be allowed to spew venom against India after his government was formed
 maaloom ho ki bharat or pakistan ke bich aatankwaad bada mudda he
 The two countries are not taking the name of improving relations due to infiltration from across the border into India
 agar imran khan aatankwaad ke khilaaf prabhavi karrwai karne main safal rahete hai, to nishchit rup se yah donon mulkon ke hit main hoga
 Interestingly, Imran Khankai has also been praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi on many issues
 ek baar unhone jab piem modi se mulaakaat kii thi, to unki kaaphi tarif kii thi or unase kaaphi prabhavit dikh rahe the
 Advocacy of resolving Kashmir issue: Imran Khan believes that both countries can resolve Kashmir issue through back channel and now its time has come
 aisa karnaa donon deshon ke liye hit main bhi he
 In 2012, in response to a question from Aaj Tak, he said, "india and Pakistan together can resolve all the conflicting issues including Kashmir
" haalanki jahaan par aaj hindustan or pakistan khadey hai
 In view of this, to say that we will solve these issues easily, is wrong
 lekin itnaa jarur kaha ja saktaa he ki agar meri party kii sarkaar banati he, to ham in masalon ko hal kar lenge
 He also claimed, quoting three former foreign ministers, that the Kashmir issue had come close to being resolved several times through the back channel, but could not for any reason
 unhone kaha tha ki ham samajhate hai ki yah masalaa hal ho saktaa he
 During this time he also promised that after his government is formed, steps will be taken to restore trust between the two countries
 islam par tikaa loktantr chaahate hai imran khanimran khan kii kalpana main ek aisa loktantr he, jisaki buniyaad islam par tiki he yaa phir ek aisa loktantr jiske sheersh par islam kaa paracham laharaa rahaa ho
 But Imran has failed to define his Islamic democracy
 islam or loktantr do alag chijen hai
 While Islam talks about the rule through the Khilafat, democracy is ruled by a government elected by the people
 isamen apane pratinidhiyon ko chunane kii aazaadee, abhivyakti kii swatantraaa, aalochana karne, apane tareeke se jeene, khaane-pine or pahanane kii aazaadee hoti he, jabaki islam kahata he ki aap tayshuda tareeke se jivan jien
 In such a situation, Imran's imagination of Islamic democracy is beyond comprehension
 shaayad pakistan ke langade loktantr ke peeche ek bada kaaran yah bhi he, kyonki imran se pehle pakistani shaskaon ne islamic loktantr ke khvabgah ko jameen par utaarne kii koshish kii thi
 However, Imran Khan wants to improve the bad shape of his country's politics
 taliban se baatcheet kaa samarthanpakistan main imran khan ko taliban samarthak ke taur par janaa jaataa he
 However, they blame the English media of Pakistan for this
 apana or apane desh kaa itihaas likhte hue imran jab taliban or alqaida ke bare main bataate he, to unke shabdon ke chayan se spasht samaj main aata he ki taliban ke prati imran kaa jhukaav he
 The training of tribal fighters against the Soviet Union by the US and then after a decade of waging war on these fighters is dangerous for the world or after 9 / 11, the indirect campaign of waging US war against Muslims in the whole world Imran Khan has been openly opposed
 iske alaava america kii samrajyavaadee nitiyon ke saamne pakistan kaa ghutane tech dena imran ko raas nahin aata he
 The alliance of power with Allah, the Army and the United States, Imran Khanka believes that only one can rule in Pakistan with 3A i
e
 Allah, Army and America
 haalanki imran khan jis loktantr kaa khwab dekhte hai, usamen sena kii bhoomika seemaa par he
 They are also against the interference of the US in Pakistan
 is baar ke chunaav main sena ne imran khan kaa khulkar samarthan kiya or unako jeet mili
 The political party tehreek-e-insaf, formed in the year 1996, had to face many problems, with Imran at the center
 saal 2002 ke chunaav main pehali baar unki party ko ek seat par jeet mili
 Islam and tribal values are more attentive to Western institutions and their secularism, but describe their traditions and social structure as the best
 wo pashchimi jivan style ke aalochak bhi hai
 Imran Khan, who spent the first years of his life in the West, is influenced by the political system there, but after retiring from cricket, he grew more fond of Islam, tribal values and styles
 duniya bhar main ek cheez dekhne main aati he ki agar vyakti apni samskruti or mulyon ke prati dridhta kaa bhav rakhata he, to use apane hi desh main dakshinpanthi qaraar de diya jaataa he
 This could also be one of the reasons behind Pakistan's introduction of Imran as pro-taliban by the English media
 raajnneeti ke saath romancerajnneeti ke saath imran khan kaa romance rochak he
 Recently she married a much younger Pakistani journalist Reham Khan
 haalanki unki yah shaadi zyada din nahin chali or rishta tut gaya
 Both got divorced
 iske baad imran khan ne teesri shaadi kar lee
 There is a lot of discussion about their romance in Pakistan
 rajasthan ke charchit anandapal encounter maamle main sibiai ne jaanch karne se inkaar kar diya he
 This information was given by the CBI to the court during the hearing of a petition filed by Anandpal's wife Rajakwar in the Jodhpur High Court
 soobe kii sarkaar ne anandapal encounter kii jaanch sibiai se karaane kii anushansa centre se kii thi

 According to police sources, he was told by Anandpal's associates that he is hiding in Salasar
 darasal esaoji ne anandapal ke do bhaaiyon devendra urf guttu or vicky ko haryana ke sirsa se giraftaar kiya tha
 The IG of SOG was camping in Haryana for the last month and a half
 anandapal ke bhaaiyon se poochtacha main pataa chalaa ki anandapal saalasar main shravan singh naamak shaks ke ghar main chipa hua he
 After the news was confirmed, SOG tried to capture Anandpal by siege, but he started firing at the police from the roof of the house
 esaoji ne bhi javaabi karrwai main firing kii, jisamen vah maaraa gaya
 After this encounter, there was a ruckus in Rajasthan
 anandapal ke gharavaalon or chaahane waalon kaa kahana tha ki uskaa encounter farji tha
 He was killed after he was surrendered
 anandapal kii maa or uski beti is encounter kii sibiai jaanch kii maang kar rahe the
 Under heavy pressure, the Rajasthan government had to recommend a CBI inquiry
 bataate chalem kianandpal singhke encounter par sawaal uthaane vaale log use robinhood maanate hai
 While in the police record he was such a notorious gangster that even the court had to declare him an absconder six times
 encounter se kareeb dedh saal pehle wo kaid se faraar ho gaya tha
 Thousands of policemen were engaged day and night in search of him
 iaiti madras ne centre sarkaar ko mili agyaat shikaayat ke aadhaar par chaatro ke ek group ke khilaaf karrwai kii he
 The complaint said that this group of students tried to 'spread hatred' against Prime Minister Narendra Modi by distributing pamphlets and posters that were instigated in the campus
 abendkar periyar student cirkil naamak is chaatr samooh ko kaha gaya he ki ve na to auditorium, na iaiti kaa email or na hi notice board kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 The Ministry of Human Resource Development had recently received a complaint
 shikaayat main is group kaa ek panfalet bhi bheja gaya tha, jisamen modi sarkaar kii aalochana kii gai thi
 An anonymous letter sent to the government alleged that Abandekar Periyar Study Circle was spreading disharmony among students in the name of caste and an attempt was being made to spread hatred against the Prime Minister and Hindus as well
 mantralay kaa patr milane ke baad iaiti madras ke dean em shrinivasana ne kathith taur par study cirkil ko ek sakht chitthee likhte hue 'suvidhaon ke durupyog' kaa aarope lagaaya
 However, the group of students denied the allegation, stating that they were not calling for a demonstration against the central government and the institute did not give them a chance to clean up and take a unilateral and undemocratic decision
 tippaniyan Abhinav, a member of the study circle, said, We have not violated the constitution

 Everyone knows that Rahul will become Congress President after Sonia
 2014 main badi haar ke baad tay ho gaya tha ki rahul gandhi kaman jald sanbhaalenge
 The sources had told many dates
 rahul party ke bade faisle bhi karne lage, lekin adhyaksh kaa thappa lagane kaa intjaar badhata gaya
 In the meeting of Congress Working Committee on Monday, former PM Manmohan Singh and AK Antony said in the presence of Rahul that the time has come now that Rahul Gandhi should become the President of the party
 jiske baad sabhi netaaon ne iskaa samarthan kar diya
 The Working Committee unanimously recommended this
 sutron ke mutabik, jab rahul se adhyaksh banane ko kaha gaya to rahul ne kaha ki main taiyaar hum, lekin kisi ke man main koi rigerveshan ho to plis mujhe bataaen
 i want to walk in harmony with senior and youth
 party ne maanga vaktis mudde par party ke media prabharee randeep surajevaala ne kaha ki khud rahul gandhi bhi har chunauti ko sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 But on when Rahul would officially take charge, Surjewala said that Rahul would be made the chairman by calling a meeting or session of the Congress Working Committee, which is a process
 ye kal bhi ho saktaa he, disambar main bhi ho saktaa he or agle saal bhi
 That is, the date could not be revealed once again
 saath hi kaarysmiti ne prastaav paas kar chunaav ayog ko bhi bhej diya ki party ke sanghathan ke chunaav ke liye usko dobaaraa ek saal kaa ekstansion chahie, yani disambar 2017 tak kaa vakt
 According to sources, Sonia did not attend the working committee meeting due to illness
 rahul ne baithak kii adhyakshata kii, jiske baad sabhi ne ye sifarish kar di
 That is, Sonia tried to show everyone standing behind Rahul by eliminating the gap between old and new within the party and that too in his absence
 saath hi sonia kii kam se kam apni taraf se ye sandesh dene kii koshish bhi rahi ki wo rahul ko thope nahin raheen
 Overall, it is as if the script of the story has already been written
 aise main ab gandhi parivaar ko rahul ko kaman dene kii taarikh tay kerani he
 According to sources close to the family, the Gandhi family has several proposals
 1
 Let it be on the birthday of Indira Gandhi on 19 November
 2
 UP should be done just before the election, which will benefit in the election
 3
 Rahul is in favor of elections in the party, so after the elections of the states in February, those organizations should take command through elections
 isse party ne in rajyon kharaab pradarshan kiya to thikra rahul par na phute
 In such a situation, the ball is now in the court of the Gandhi family and most of the leaders are holding elections in this respect, when the command is to be handed over to Rahul, it should be handed over quickly

 Due to one such statement, Akhilesh was dismissed from the Cabinet by Khadi and Village Industries Minister Raja Ram Pandey of UP
 raja ram pandey ne shuukravaar ko pratapgarh main kaha tha ki bela kii sadake hema malini ke gaal kii tarah chamakengi abhi to isaki facial ho rahi he
 This is not the first time that the minister has spoken, he has also praised the beauty of the District Magistrate of Sultanpur district in a ceremony as Minister in charge
 raja ram pandey ne kaha tha ki yah meraa saubhaahgya he ki main duusari baar is jile kaa prabharee mantri bana hum
 i have a chance to work with a beautiful DM here every time
 jab maine jile kii purv dm kamini chouhan ratan ko dekha, to laga ki unase khubasurat mahila ho hi nahin sakati he
 But this new DM (dhanalakshmi) is even more beautiful than him
 inke baat karne kaa lahaza bhi behatar he
 'lalu Yadav also gave a similar statement

 In the BSP-SP alliance in the state of Uttar Pradesh, the Congress hopes are still alive
 uttar pradesh kii siyasat main loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle priyanka gandhi wadra kii sakriy raajnneeti main entry ne ek baar phir se bijepi ke khilaaf sapa-basapa ke gathbandhan main congress ke jagah paane kii ummid jagaa di he
 According to information received by sources from NDTV, the Congress is in touch with the leadership of Samajwadi Party and Priyanka Gandhi will directly talk to Akhilesh Yadav on the issue of joining the SP-BSP alliance of Congress and getting maximum seats
 samaajawaadee party ke netaaon ne enditivi se kaha ki akhilesh yadav baatcheet ke liye taiyaar hai, magar sabase badi chunauti he mayawati ko samajhaana
 However, on record, he said that both parties are not in a position to comment on the possibilities of talks with the Congress
 uttar pradesh se rajyasabha saansad pramod tiwari ne enditivi se kaha ki yah aisa masalaa he, jis par main coment nahin kar saktaa
 In fact, Priyanka Gandhi commanded the alliance talks with Akhilesh Yadav even before the 2017 assembly elections
 magar chunaav main parinaam donon dalon ke liye kaaphi kharaab sabit hue the
 Nevertheless, Akhilesh Yadav did not rule out future alliances
 haalanki, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main seat shering ko lekar antim daur main baat nahin bani thi
 It is said that Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati separated the Congress from the alliance due to the stubborn attitude of Congress leaders in the state
 jabaki sapa or basapa ke vidhayak ab bhi madhya pradesh or rajasthan main congress sarkaar ko samarthan kar rahe hai
 Actually, Congress has announced to field its candidates in all 80 Lok Sabha seats of UP
 upi kii 80 siten kisi bhi party ke liye centre main raaj karne ke liye kaaphi ahm hoti hai
 This is the reason that with the intention of strengthening the Congress in UP and winning more and more seats, Rahul Gandhi made his biggest political bet and gave Priyanka Gandhi the command of Eastern UP
 itnaa hi nahin, upi fatah karne ke liye rahul ne priyanka gandhi ke alaava jyotiraditya sindhiya ko bhi pashchimi upi kaa prabharee bana diya
 While Mayawati's Bahujan Samaja Party and Akhilesh's Samajwadi Party have agreed to contest 38-38 seats in Uttar Pradesh, now Congress leaders say that they expect Akhilesh Yadav to give at least 8 to 10 seats
 Will convince you for haalanki, congress netaa ke aise daavon ko sapa netaaon ne inkaar kar diya
 He says that if his party contests only 28 seats, it will not be beneficial for us
 congress kii siton ke liye donon partiyon ko tyaag karnaa hoga
 However, SP leaders also said that Akhilesh Yadav wants the best situation to defeat the BJP
 vahiin, akhilesh yadav ke aadhikari pravaktaa ne kaha ki aisi khabaren kaalpanik hai
 Let me tell you that earlier Aparna Yadav, the younger daughter-in-law of the Yadav family, has also praised Priyanka Gandhi
 unhone kaha ki agar 2017 main priyanka gandhi ko gathbandhan kii ore se mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa banaaya jaataa to parinaam kuch or saamne aate

 Scindia, who played a big role in the Congress victory in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections, was considering himself as the CM candidate
 lekin baad main congress alaakaman ne unako najrandaaj karte hue madhya pradesh congress adhyaksh kamalnath ko siem bana diya
 However, at that time, he was somehow extinguished and pacified
 lekin baad main jab loksabhaa chunaav main party kii karaari haar hui to unhone mahasachiv ke pad se istipha de diya
 In the working committee meeting, the Chief Ministers were targeted without name
 jaahir he unke nishane par siem kamalnath rahe honge

 vahiin, baaki siton par republican party of india (arpiai) jaise gathbandhan ke chote dal chunaav lard sakate hai

 iske tahat dhan kii paraali jalaane par roak, chaara bank sthapit karne, paraali kii khet main hi composting jaise kai upaay kiye jaaenge
 Not only this, unemployed youth will get employment in the management of farms and they will use new machines like Happy Cedar

 Apart from this, there is also a plan to set up fodder banks so that the remaining starch can be sold as fodder to other parts of the country

 Gopal Rai, a minister in the Aam Aadmi Party government and member of the political affairs committee of the party, has clarified the allegations of selling the Rajya Sabha ticket for Rs 50 crore
 fasebuk par party kaaryakartaaon se baatcheet ke dauraan gopal raay ne arvind kejariwal kaa bachaav karte hue bhrashtachar na karne kii 6 badi vajah ginai hai
 Gopal Rai enumerated these 6 reasons: Reason number 1 is the strong man in Delhi for the last 3 years, the Aam Admi Party is headed by the government, Arvind Kejriwal
 agar arvind kejariwal ko paise khaane hote to dilli main bijli companiyon kaa karodon kaa turn over he
 Before our government, electricity prices were increased every year and crores of rupees were consumed
 agar arvind kejariwal kii niyat main khot hota or bijli companiyaan daam badha den to karodon rupye aam aadmi party ko chande main mil sakate hai, lekin aam aadmi party samjhauta karne or paisa kamaane satta main nahin ai he
 Reason number 2 is that there are more than one thousand private schools inside Delhi
 pehle jab skool kii fees badhati thi tab bijepi congress ke log chande ke rup main skulon se paisa vasuulate the
 If Arvind Kejriwal and Aam Aadmi Party had to take money, they would have allowed private schools to increase the fees
 lekin sarkaar ne aisa nahi kiya jabaki privet skool jamkar lut rahe hai
 The reason was that thousands of crores were recovered from the number 3 tanker mafias, but these mafias can be controlled only by Arvind Kejriwal
 vajah number 4dilli main drug mafiaon ke kabja tha
 But the drug mafia has cracked after the government freeed medicines and treatment
 vajah number 5dilli main kai bade aspataal hai
 If Arvind Kejriwal was not doing honest politics, then the license of Max Hospital would not be canceled
 arvind kejariwal kii himmat kaa kaaran eemaandaaree he
 Reason number 6: Former Prime Minister of the country, Rajiv Gandhi said that when 100 rupees are released, then 90 rupees are lost and only 10 rupees are left
 dilli sarkaar kaa 40 hajaar karod se zyada kaa bajet he or kejariwal agar 1% kii setting bhi kar lete to hajaaron karod kama sakate hai
 But the Aam Aadmi Party government did not do so

 com / xfrrml9ulk— Raksha Mantri (@defenceminindia) August 25, 2018 Congress leader and former Chief Minister of Karnataka, Siddaramaiah today condemned Sitharaman and alleged that he was more interested in dominating our minister, expressing bjp's 'apathy' towards the state it occurs
 maamla badhane pararaksha mantralayane aaj is ghatana par ek spashtikaran jari kiya or rajya ke mantri ke vyavhaar par sawaal uthaaya
 The clarification said that according to the schedule, after visiting the affected areas, the Defense Minister was getting in touch with the ex-servicemen who were badly affected by the flood, during which the District In-charge Minister objected to it and insisted that before meeting with the officials Should be mantralay ne kaha ki raksha mantri ne spasht kiya he ki purv sainikon kaa kalyaan mantralay kaa ek aavashyak hissaa he or yah kaarykram ke anusaar hi tha
 The District Minister insisted that the Defense Minister immediately stop the conversation with him and go for a meeting with the officials
 mantralay ne kaha ki sitaraman ne tatkaal baithak roak di or adhikariyon ke saath baithak karne ke liye vah vahaan se chal deen
 He said that the place had already been made for press conference and the officials were also called there for hasty review
 sabhi mediakarmiyon kii maujuudagi main adhikariyon ke saath baithak yojit karnaa abhootpurv tha
 The ministry said that it was followed by a personal comment against the defense minister, which was not even responsive
 is ghatana ke baad mahesh ne kaha ki sitaraman kaa bayaan kodagu ke liye kendra se dhanrashi kii maang kii pratikriya ke rup main aayaa he
 a ministry of the new government has drawn attention from the very first day and this is the Ministry of Human Resources

 That too in the middle of the session
 isse chaatr-chaatraon main bada bhram failaa or kisi kii samaj main nahin aayaa ki kya ho rahaa he
 Sanskrit was made a compulsory subject by removing German and now schools are saying that it will not be possible to take Sanskrit examination
 yani ek tarah se afratfari kaa maahaul ban gaya
 Now news has come that a circular has been issued regarding keeping the school open on Christmas so that Good Governance Day can be celebrated that day
 us din atal bihari vaajapeyi or pandit madanamohan malviya kaa janmdin he
 This news has created a huge controversy
 aakhir ek badi chuttee ko kaise radd kiya ja saktaa he khaskar jabaki us din se hajaaron skulon main sardi kii chhuttiyaan ho jaati hai or duusare shaharon se aae bachche apane ghar vagairah jate hai
 Nobody understood how the minister issued such a decree
 ab unhone twitor ke jariye spasht kiya he ki aisa kuch nahin he or skool us din band rahenge lekin ek niabandh pratiyogita online hogi
 The minister gave his clarification about this and called the news about this as false
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay vivaad paidaa karne vaale kadam kyon uthaa rahaa he, yah kisi kii samaj main nahin aa rahaa he
 Whose good will it be, it is also not clear
 christmas khushiyon kaa tyohaar he or usamen sabhi shaamil hote hai
 Smriti Irani would also have celebrated Christmas holidays at her school
 beshak vah jashn main shaamil nahin hui hongi lekin dusron kii khushiyon par pani pher dene kaa yah aadha-adhuraa faisla dukhad he
 Now Smriti has made it clear that the schools will be closed on that day but the question is why such unnecessary controversy arose? It would be better to avoid memory disputes and improve the functioning of this ministry
 yah desh ke bhavishya se sidhe judaa hua he or yahaan har kadam soch-samajhakar uthaane kii jarurat he
 They also have to understand that by canceling the holidays, children will not be able to read much

 a Bihar MLA had filed a petition in Patna High Court to elect Nitish as the leader of the JD (U) Legislature Party

 MLA Raj's advocate SBK Mangalam said that during the hearing, the court has ordered to maintain status quo on the issue of being elected leader of the legislative party
 is maamle kii agali sunwaayee 17 farvari ko hogi
 It is noteworthy that on February 9, MLA Rajeshwar Raj filed a petition in Patna High Court alleging that Nitish Kumar was elected as the new leader of the Legislative Party without releasing Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi from the post of Legislature Party leader
 vidhayak ne yachika main kaha he ki vidhayak dal ke netaa maanjhi ko na sanvaidhanik tareeke se padmukt kiya gaya or na hi hataaya gaya to phir kis sthiti main vidhayak dal ke nae netaa kaa chunaav kiya gaya
 Manjhi is already calling the election of the leader of the legislature party unconstitutional
 7 farvari ko jad (you) vidhanmandal kii baithak main nitish ko nayaa netaa chunaa gaya tha
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress directly surrounded Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the Rafale deal and alleged that 'the watchman is a thief'

 That is, the election battle this time was fiercely fought on social media and social media also played a big role in the election
 is bich lokniti-csds kaa ek taaja survey samaane aayaa he
 In which many shocking figures have been revealed about social media
 soshal media par aise log bhare pade hai jo maanate hai ki bharat ek hindu raashtra he
 The survey has included Facebook, whatsapp, Twitter and Instagram users
 survey main 5 saal ke aankade ko dikhaane kii koshish kii gai he
 If we consider the survey data, sometimes people who use social media sometimes see the identity of India by connecting with the Hindu nation
 survey main okeginal, vikali, or rojaanaa soshal media se jude logon kii raay lee gai he
 Apart from this, those who do not use social media were also consulted
 ham sab jaanate hai ki bharat ek dharm nirpeksh desh he
 But social media users largely oppose this
 soshal media par hameshaa sakriy rahane vaale 19 fisadi log maanate hai ki bharat keval hinduon kaa he
 While 17 per cent of people who do not use social media have such a view
 vahiin soshal media par hameshaa sakriy rahane vaale 75 fisad yugers maanate hai ki bharat main sabhi dharm ek samaan he
 At the same time, 73 people who do not use social media believe this
 ye donon aankade aapako hairaan kar rahaa hoga
 But these are the results of the survey conducted in the last 5 years on social media
 survey ke dauraan soshal media yugers se kai tarah ke sawaal puche gaye
 If we look at the figures, about three-fourths of people in all categories believe that all religions are equal in India, that is, all religions are equal for this country, a country cannot be seen by connecting with any one religion
 keval 14 se 17 fisadi log maanate hai ki bharat keval hinduon kaa he
 At the same time, compared to those who do not use social media, social media users believe that the country's Muslim is also nationalist

 At the same time, senior BJP leader Sushma Swaraj requested the Prime Minister to convene a special session of Parliament to toughen the existing law related to this heinous crime
 rashtriya rajdhani main shanivaar ko bade paimaane par virodh pradarshan hua
 Policemen lathi-charged the students who were demonstrating near Rashtrapati Bhavan and Parliament House, on which the BJP and the Left accused Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the UPA President of keeping silence on the incident
 sushamaa ne kaha ki unhone pradhanmantri se baat kar unase sansad kaa vishesh satr bulaane kaa anurodh kiya he taaki mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh karne waalon ko kathor sajaa dene ke liye kanoon main badlaav ho sake
 Sushma said on Twitter that the Prime Minister has told her that he will consider this suggestion
 bhaajapa ne pradhanmantri or sonia se mahilaon kii suraksha par desh ko bharosa dilaaye jane kii bhi maang kii he
 Party spokesman Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the Prime Minister should address the people
 police ko samvedansheel hona chahie
 The way he lathi-charged the protesters, showered water on them and the entire attitude of the police and administration towards this is very regrettable and condemnable
 police karrwai kii ninda karte hue vamadalon ne bhi pradhanmantri se aropiyon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kiye jane ke bare main raashtra ko yah bharosa dilaane ko kaha
 CPI National Secretary d Raja said, "if the Prime Minister can address the nation on the issue of allowing FDI in retail, then why are they not getting time for such gruesome crimes against women

 The Dalit leader said that special courts should be set up wherever needed so that pending cases can be disposed of quickly
 unhone is mudde par dilli main ho rahe chaatro ke pradarshan kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki yah shubh sanket he ki aaj ke yuva swatantra hai or kisi raajnneetik party ke binar tale pradarshan nahin kar rahe hai
 This shows that the younger generation is sensitive
 ’ Singer Shaan, who has lent his voice for many of the best songs in Bollywood films, says that now producers and musicians do not want to give their voice a place in their films
 shaan ne apni sureeli awaz se ‘dil chahta he’ main ‘koi kahe kahata rahe’, ‘phna’ main ‘chand sifarish’, ‘saanwariyaa’ main ‘jab se tere naina’ or ‘thri idiyats’ main ‘bahati hawa sa’ jaise geeton kii safalataa main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi lekin ab hindi filmon main unke geeton kii sankhya kam hoti ja rahi he
 The comments shaan se kaha, ‘‘yah prastaav par nirbhar karata he
 It is not that i am not choosing songs or i have increased my budget
 yadi log mujhe prastaav hi nahin de rahe to kya kiya ja saktaa he
 Perhaps the audience still likes my voice but the producers, actors or music directors no longer like it
 meri awaz shaayad aajkal ke geeton ke anukool nahin he
 '' 41 varshiya abhinayta ne kaha, ‘‘sachai yah he ki ek gayak ke taur par aaj bhi mujhamen kaaphi pratibha he
 The type of singers being selected for songs nowadays reduces the age of the song
 ’’ shaan ‘jhalak dikhalaa ja’ main apni nrity pratibha dikhaate nazar aaenge
 Shaan with his melodious voice like 'koi kahe kahte rahe' in 'dil Chahta Hai', 'chand recommendation' in 'fanaa', 'jab se tere naina' in 'saawariya' and 'bahati hawa sa' in 'three Idiots' The songs played an important role in the success of the songs, but now the number of their songs in Hindi films is decreasing
 tippaniyan Said to Shan, "it depends on the proposal
 aisa nahin he ki main geet nahin chun rahaa yaa maine apana bajet badha diya he

 a special CBI court cleared the probe agency's plea to take Sinha into custody
 sinha ko brihaspativaar ko dilli main giraftaar kiya gaya tha or vahaan kii ek adaalat main unhen kal pesh kiya gaya tha
 Following a raid by the Income Tax Department and the Enforcement Directorate on October 31 last year, there were warrants against Sinha and the CBI arrested him from South Delhi

 The investigating agency is investigating the alleged illegal investment and hawala business worth Rs 2,000 crore
 sandesra lone maamle main bollywood actor dino moriya or deje akil ko saman jari kiya gaya he
 The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has called the duo for questioning
 khabar he ki sterling biotech limited / sandesra group or iske pramotor nitin sandesra, chetan sandesra or deepti sandesra ne bhartiya bainkon ko 14 hajaar 500 karod se zyada kaa chuunaa lagaaya he
 The ED is investigating this case
 pravartan nideshaalay (idi) ne daawa kiya he ki sandesra bros dwaara kiya gaya ghotaalaa pienbi ghotaale se bhi bada he
 The news agency ANI quoted ED sources as saying that Sterling Biotech Ltd / Sandesara Group and its promoters Nitin Sandesara, Chetan Sandesara and Deepti Sandesra have defrauded Indian banks of more than Rs 14,500 crore
 jabaki neerav modi ne 11 hajaar 400 karod rupee kaa bank frod kiya he
 After the cbi's FIR in the case in October 2017, the ED registered a case in this matter
 gauratlab he ki sterling biotech ke maalik sandesra bandhuon chetan jayantilal sandesra or nitin jayantilal sandesra par farji companiyaan banaakar bainkon se lone lene kaa aarope he
 The CBI had registered a fraud case of Rs 5700 crore against the Sandesara brothers

 jab gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi yojana bhawan ke tile lage haul main aate to halchal much jaati
 Secretaries and advisors say that their annual presentation to the Planning Commission was nothing short of live performance, with breathtaking jokes and audio-visual clips to tell what their state achieved last year and to meet their expectations next year what do they need
 ayog ke ek purv sadsy kaa kahana he, ‘‘modi behad utsaahi or urjavan hai, unke sachivon ko kabhi kuch bolne kii jarurat nahin padi
 He used to tell even the fine verses on his own
 ’’lekin varshon se unhen vah pratikriya nahin mili, jisaki ve apeksha karte the
 The stumped faces of Commission officials criticized Gujarat for being low in the Human Development Index
 dhire-dhire modi kii dilchaspee yojana ayog main kam hone lagi or unke prajentation kaa str bhi ghatane laga
 According to insiders, at first they considered the Commission to be important for ideas and suggestions, but later they considered it as an organization which is a gathering of stilted economists and bureaucrats who neither contribute nor increase the usefulness of the Commission
 aisi hi ek baithak main maujuud rahe ek salaahkaar bataate hai, ‘‘2009 main ek prajentation ke dauraan unhone gujarat par ek film dikhaai or kaha ki ve har prashn kaa jawaab denge
 It is clear from what opinion he had about the commission then
 ’’ antat 2013 main ve ek video ke saath yojana bhawan aae, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki ayog ‘‘dhauns jamaane vaale’’ kii tarah pesh aata he or kuch rajyon kii khaas jaruraton par gaur nahin karata
 Now the new government has lashed the Planning Commission on the death bed, on Independence Day, Prime Minister Modi announced that its existence will end soon
 ayog ke avsaan par shok karne kii bajaae kendriya mantralayon or rajya sarkaron ke adhikari behad khush hai
 First, this action to wipe out the existence of the Commission should be seen in the political context
 ek rajya kaa mukhyamantri centre main sattashin hota he or us sanstha ko dharashayi kar detaa he jisane uske rajya ke vikaas model kaa samarthan karne kii bajaae raah main rode atkaaye
 But it is not just the matter of Modi, the Commission was largely disillusioned with all the leaders and policy-makers
 uske bare main yah kaha jane laga tha ki vah vikaas main rode atakata he or aadhunik bharat kii jaruraton se anjaan he
 This is the reason why the speed of Modi's commission read Murcia, the process of replacing it with a new institution is slow
 aam janata or bade arthshaastriyon se is nae super ‘‘think tanks’’ ke swaroop or kaamkaaj par vichaar aamantrit kiye ja rahe hai
 Of course, this has triggered a kind of ideological beauty contest, from which Arvind Panagariya to Bibek Debroy, Bimal Jalan to Suresh Prabhu are vying to assure Modi that their idea is the most relevant
 lekin mahatvapurn prashn yah he ki kya is sanstha ko khatm karnaa hi paryaapt he yaa jis naukarshahi kii badaulat yah safed hathi ban gaya, usamen bhi sudhaar kiya janaa chahie
 How the Commission came to be redundant? The Planning Commission started in 1950 as a non-constitutional body, which had to distribute India's limited resources to every region and state
 tab ise paanch mahatvapurn kaam saunpe gaye the
 Pranab Sen, the head of the National Statistical Commission next to Yojana Bhavan, has been the advisor to the Planning Commission
 ve ayog ke un paanch mahatvapurn kaaryon ke bare main bataate hameek, ayog ko panchavarshiya yojanaayen taiyaar karnaa tha, jo chahunmukhi vikaas kii ruparekha tay kar sake
 Secondly, it was to decide to what extent the government could intervene in terms of policies and schemes and how much money would be required for each scheme
 tisare, yah akalan karnaa tha ki kya har skim yojana ke anukool he or sansadhano kaa adhiktam upyog ho sakegaa yaa nahin
 Fourth, every scheme had to be evaluated and continuously monitored to see if they were being implemented properly
 paanchaven, vibhinn mantralayon or centre tathaa rajyon ke bich samanvay sthapit karnaa tha
 Over time all these works started to be questioned
 1991 ke aarthik sudhaaron ke baad sansadhano kaa aavanton karne vaali panchavarshiya yojana apraasangik ho gai, kyonki baaki bache sansaadhan nijee kshetra ko die jane lage
 In modern India, preparing a plan for five years will be called a primitive step
 ayog ke ek salaahkaar kaa kahana he, ‘‘jab flipcart kii vailu ek saal main 1 arab dollar se 7 arab dollar ho sakati he to paanch saal kaa aarthik lakshya rakhane or akalan kaa kya tuk?’’duusari baat yah he ki jab yojana ayog kii sthapana hui tab se ab tak sarkari dakhal kaa tarika ekadam badal chukaa he
 In the first 19 years of its existence, the Planning Commission created a vision for the development of the country and provided funds to every state at its discretion
 lekin vah daur ekadam alag tha-lagbhag saare rajyon main congress kaa hi shashan tha or haal main swatantra hue desh ko jawaharlal nehru ke vikaas nazariye main bharosa tha
 But by 1967 it was clear that it should be closed
 alag rajyon main alag dalon kii sarkarein baniin jinka centre ke saath acha talmail nahin tha
 Apart from this, allegations of partiality started
 rajyon ko paise ke bantwaare ke liye alag vastunishth vyavastha kii jarurat thi or ise anjaam diya di
 R
 gadgil ne
 Economist Gadgil was appointed as the Deputy Chairman of the Commission by Indira Gandhi
 gadgil-mukherjee formula 1969 main shuru kiya gaya or yojana ayog ke aavanton kii sharten taiyaar kii gayi
 Under this, it was to be decided how much help a state needs, keeping in mind the population of the state, tax collection, per capita income and special needs
 baad main adhiktar kendriya sahaayta sidhi madad kii bajaae kendriya yojanaon ke jariye pahunchane lagi, jinhen rajyon ko lagu karnaa tha
 Somebody's control over the expense of this central plan was necessary
 so, phir ayog or rajyon main takaraav shuru ho gaya
 The Chief Ministers disliked every year by appearing in the Planning Commission to show how much progress they had made and it was hard to ask for money from the bureaucrats
 khaskar modi or tamilnadu kii mukhyamantri je
 Jayalalitha did not like to take such photographs in which the Deputy Chairman of the Commission was seen giving them what she had
 samanaantar naukarshahijise-jaise kendriya yojanaon kii taadaad badaae lagi (philhal 137) unki samiksha or nigaraanee sabase zyada samay khaau kaam ban gaya
 One advisor points out that this shanties fell into a trap - because the commission had a unit attached to every ministry, consisting of secretariats, offices, and personal staff, often leading to very different results
 asal main vichaaron ke aadan-pradaan or vyapak nazariye kaa manch hone kii bajaae yojana bhawan samaantar vibhaagon kaa adda ban gaya
 For example, in 2013, the fourth task of the Planning Commission, Project Monitoring, was entrusted to a separate body called the Independent Evaluation Office (IEO)
 lekin kaaryakramon kaa moolyankan karne kii bajaae iio kaa pehla suzav tha, yojana ayog ko hi khatm karnaa
 This farce does not end here
 iio ke mukhiya ajay chhibbar ko hi hataa diya gaya, jo yah sochakar gauravanvit honge ki modi ne unki sifarish par ayog ko khatm kar diya he
 In its last days, the Planning Commission had over 1,200 employees
 isamen 110 salaahkaar, nideshak or paramarshdaata the
 The annual budget of Yojana Bhavan itself is Rs 67 crore in 2013-14
 tha
 It is difficult to estimate the total operating expenses due to various schemes within its scope
 upie sarkaar ke 10 saal ke shashan main yojana ayog ko montek singh aahluwalia kii adhyakshata main pradhanmantri manmohan singh kaa sahyog mila, or vah un kshetron main ja kuuda jo ise dusron ke liye chhod dene chahie the
 It started assessing agreements for large public-private partnership (PPP) projects in the infrastructure sector
 yah parivahan or urja mantralayon ke saath lambii chali ladaai kii shuruyaat thi
 These ministries accused the commission of stalling several projects

 P
 singh ne bhootal parivahan sachiv ko likhaa, ‘‘pri-aprijal baithken band kii jaani chahie kyonki inase koi laabh nahin hota or ayog har baar vahi suzav detaa he
 In 2013, the Commission prepared a nine-point action plan for Naxal-affected areas, which it was implementing as if it were a ministry
 isse bhi virodh ke swar uthe
 For this reason, the Commission failed to do its fifth task - coordination between various ministries and state governments, whereas in a country with so many governments and departments it was extremely important
 ab bhi he praasangikaalanki yojana ayog ab khatm ho rahaa he, lekin is bare main sab ekamat hai ki desh ke bhavi vikaas kii ruparekha taiyaar karne vaali ek sanstha kii jarurat he, jo itani vishalkay na ho
 Arun Myra, a former Planning Commission member in his recent book Redesigning the Aeroplane Why Flying: Reforming Institutions, recalls that Manmohan Singh had stated in 2009 that the commission should transform itself into a system reform commission
 maayra ko ‘‘20 pratishthit logon’’ kii suchi bhi di gai, jisamen purv varisht naukarshah, ayog ke purv sadsy or agrani udyogpati shaamil the
 All this was to be talked about the new form of the Planning Commission
 maayra ne jin logon se baat kii, ve sabhi is baat par sahamat the ki nai dilli main arthshaastriyon ke ek samooh ko sansadhano ke aavanton kaa adhikaar nahin diya janaa chahie, khaskar aaj ke daur main jab rajyon kaa prashasan behatar dhang se ho rahaa he or unke paas jamini sachaaiyon ke bare main adhik jaankaree he
 According to him, there is a need for such a strategic institution, which has experts and who provide detailed inputs to the government and industries about what shape the economy of the country should take
 yani ek super think tanks, jo paanch saal kii samaysima se na bandhaa ho yaa vichaarkon kaa aisa samooh jo sarkaar ko bataae ki desh ko kis cheez kii jarurat he- ek-duusare se judi nadiyaan yaa bullate train, ity hub yaa chini milen, 8,000 falte-phoolate shahar yaa 100 smart city
 a former vice-chairman, who now attends meetings to outline the nature of the other body, instead of the commission, says the new institution should play a key role in coordination among the various ministries
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘gramin mahilaon ke liye shauchalay banane vaali yojana taiyaar karne ke liye lagbhag chah mantralayon ko shaamil hona padegaa, jisamen bahut samay lagata he
 For this, an authorized organization is needed which combines all perspectives and moves forward
 ’’arthshaastri bibek debaroy bhi maanate hai ki aisi sanstha kii jarurat he jo lambii avadhi ke lakshya laae
 He says, "if the government decides that infant mortality should be so high by 2040, who will assure that active agencies are moving in the right direction to achieve this figure?" ’’ unka kahana he ki niyojan jamini str se kaam karne vaali vikendrikrut kavayad ho to behatar hota
 These are in line with the concrete steps the new government has talked about in the 2013-14 Economic Survey
 iske liye nae utpaadakta ayog kii jarurat hogi jo sarkari vibhaagon or mantralayon kaa report card taiyaar kare or unhen saarvajanik kare
 What is the way forward? Initial indications to pave the way for such an institution are that the government is looking to bring the Department of Expenditure of the old commission — which had decided on the allocation of funds to the ministries — under the Ministry of Finance
 kai visheshgyon ne is bare main ashankaayen vyakt kii hai
 He argues that there will be no control over the power of the Finance Ministry
 vahi fund kaa srijan karegaa or yah faisla bhi legaa ki use kahaan kharch kiya jaae
 "the finance ministry tries to reduce expenditure, so its first victim may be social sector spending," says Debroy
 ’’ kuch log bataate hai ki in kaaryon ko duusari sansthaaon ko saunpane se kuch badalane vaala nahin
 The only difference would be that the building would change
 ek varisht sarkari sachiv kehete hai, ‘‘yojana ayog ko khatm karne ke liye jaruri he ki sarkaar in prakriyaaon se alag rahe
 This would mean moving towards decentralization
 ’’ is nai sanstha kaa swaroop sangheey vyavastha ko samarpit modi sarkaar kii agnipariksha hoga, khaskar agar unki sarkaar kendriya yojanaon kii sankhya kam karti he or ekamusth paisa rajya sarkaron ko bhejti he
 The hastily launched efforts can bring about the most radical change in the functioning of government after liberalization
 beshak, bharat ko yojanaayen to chahie, lekin koi ayog nahin

 Today is the 197th death anniversary of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte
 unka nidhan 5 may 1821 ko hua tha
 Many things were said about his death
 aaie jaanate hai aakhir kaise hui unki maut?itihaaskaar maanate hai ki unki maut kaa kaaran pet kaa cancer tha
 Napoleon was exiled to the island of St
 Helena in 1821 after being defeated at the Battle of Waterloo where he died at the age of 52 years

 His death is also considered to be a murder committed under the conspiracy

 Investigation revealed that Napoleon's hair contained about 38 times more arsenic poison than normal
 upachaar kii vidhiyon ke kaaran hui mautnapolian kii maut par america vaigyanik ek nai theory ko lekar aayaa jo kiye saare daavon se alag thi
 He said that the treatment given to Napoleon's disease killed him
 unhen niyamit rup se potacium tartret naamak jaharila namak diya jaataa tha jisase wo ulti kar saken or enima lagaaya jaataa tha
 This led to a deficiency of potassium in them, which is fatal to the heart
 nepolian ko unki aanton kii safai ke liye 600 milligram maracurik chloride diya gaya or do din baad unki mrityu ho gai
 Leonardo da Vinci never went to school, yet he did these great things, tell you, Napoleon had four brothers and three sisters

 He was admitted to the military academy of France to become a military officer
 sainik skool main shiksha ke baad usne 1784 main topakhane se sambandhit vishyon kaa adhyayan karne ke liye paris ke ek college main daakhila liya
 At the age of 24, he won his first victory in the Battle of the Tulas (a place in France) against the British
 1796 main france kii diarectory, paanch sadasyon kaa samooh jo france kii suraksha kaa zimmedaar tha, ne use italy kii sena kaa commander bana diya

 Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, after meeting with the commissioners of the three municipal corporations, has clearly stated that they should either bring an action plan to get the corporation out of the losses in three weeks or go away
 enditivi india se khaas baatcheet main dipti siem sisodiya ne kaha ki nigam ghate main kyon chal rahe hai, isaki javabdehi honi chahie
 The commissioners of the three municipal corporations have been asked to give such a plan to recover the losses from the corporation in three weeks, how the corporation will come out of the losses in a year
 agar vah plan laa sakate hai to thik he, varna kisi or ko unki jagah lagaaya jayega
 According to the Delhi government, the worst condition among the three municipal corporations is that of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation
 hamaare samvaadadaata ne purvi dilli nagar nigam kii meyar minakshi devi se khaas baatcheet kii
 Meenakshi says that the corporation is currently at a total loss of 500 crore rupees per annum and he suggests that the same municipal corporation should be re-created as before there was only one corporation
 minakshi devi ke mutabik, is nagar nigam main revenue ke strot kam hai or kharchaa zyada isliye nigam kii haalat itani kharaab he ki karmchaariyon ko selary dena bhi mushkil ho rahaa he or pension to do saal se nahin di gai he
 According to the mayor, she has sought an appointment with Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, in which she will inform them on the situation of the corporation, but she has not got time yet
 aapako bataa den ki purvi dilli nagar nigam main jahaan salanaa ghaataa kareeb 500 karod rupee he vahiin uttari dilli nagar nigam me ghaataa salanaa kareeb saat sau karod rupee he jabaki dakshini dilli nagar nigam main abhi na ghaataa he na phayda
 The financial condition of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi has always been bad, but about three years ago, while dividing a municipal corporation into three parts, it was argued that this would bring transparency and stop the tradition of eating and eating
 udhaaharan ke liye dakshini dilli ilaake se revenue zyada miltaa he jabaki purvi dilli ke ilaakon se kam to ye daleel di gai thi ki nagar nigam ab khud apana rajasav or kharchaa dekhegaa or apane ko majboot karegaa
 However, the decision was also political because the position of the mayor of Delhi and the stature equivalent to the CM of Delhi weakened by dividing it into three parts and the strength of the CM increased further
 jaise centre kii sarkaar dilli ko anudaan yaa sahaayta ke rup main paisa detii he thik vaise hi dilli sarkaar nagar nigam ko apane bajet main anudaan yaa sahaayta detii he isliye dilli kii nai aap sarkaar kaa kahana he ki vah nagar nigam ko patari par laana chaahati he or uskaa maananaa he ki karpshan ke chalate nagar nigam ghate main he or ab nigamon ke upar he ki vah kya plan lekar aate he
 After that Delhi government will consider further action

 , Whose life passes through the dubbing studio by day and at home by night
 rohan kii ek hi tamanna he ki usko ek aisa hamasafar mili jiske saath wo apni sari jindagi guzaar sake
 That is when Supriya (yami Gautam) enters Rohan's life and seeing Rohan's personality, Supriya is very impressed and both get married
 'kuch din' nahin bahut din yaad rahegaa 'kaabil' kaa nayaa ganadonon divyang hote hue bhi ek duusare ke pyaar main khoye rahete hai tabhi achaanak ek din aisa aata he jab korporator madhavrao shellar (ronit roy) or amit shellar (rohit roy ) kii vajah se rohan kii jindagi se supriya hameshaa ke liye chali jaati he
 To avenge this, Rohan makes a plan and eventually Truth wins
 jaaniye aakhir film ko kyon dekh sakate hai -- rithik roshan kii behtareen adaakaari ek baar phir se dekhne ko mili he jo aapako imotional karne ke saath sochane par bhi vivash karti he
 - Yami Gautam and Hrithik have played the differently abled character
 ronit roy or unki dialog delivery bhi kamaal kii he
 The work of Narendra Jha and Suresh Menon is also effortless
 - haalankifilm kii kahanike bare main to trailor se pataa chal hi gaya tha, baavjood iske film dekhte vakt boriyat nahin hoti
 This is the USP of the film
 - film ke gaanon kii khaasiyat he ki wo kahani ko aage lekar jate hai
 - The film's cinematography and background score is good, which is also typical of Sanjay Gupta's films
 vijayawargeey bole- 'kaabil' ho to chywala bhi piem varanaa 'rais' bhi fate kurte main- film main divyang ke hisaab se research work thik he, jaise paison kii samaj, sunne kii parakh, khaanaa pakaana ityadi
 Also, Divyang maintains an interest in revenge planning for humans
 box offisfilmalgbhag 2350 screens par relies hui he
 By the way, the budget of the film, including the cost of marketing and promotion, is being told about 50 crores, which does not include the fees of Hrithik Roshan
 khabaron ke mutabik, film ke mujeec (8 karod), digital or satelit ritis (50 karod ) pehle se hi bik chuke hai
 Overseas (16 crores) and distribution (42 crores) are being said
 film kii recovery cost 80 karod he
 If the film earns 85 crores then it will be called a hit and a super hit after earning 120 crores
 vaise 5 din kaa weekend he or behtareen opening ke chances hai

 Now for the first time in Bollywood, an actress has made serious allegations against a celebrity
 maamle main ek paksh kii ore se safai aane ke baad actresstanushri dattane india today tivi se exclusive baatcheet main sambandhit ghatana kaa silsilewar zikr kiya
 Tanushree said that the case is being presented in such a way that a bold actress has accused the famous and reputed actor
 aap nahin jaanate the ki 10 saal pehle kya maahaul tha
 Nana's similar behavior is also discussed in Bollywood about the second actress
 mere paas iske koi saboot nahin hai, lekin aisa suna gaya he
 48-year-old Padmalakshmi was revealed - At the age of 16, on the question of filing an FIR against Mera Repanana, Tanushree said, "I went to the police station complaint and told everything there
 lekin isse pehle ki ham kuch samaj pate, ek counter exiaar pehle se hi taiyaar thi
 i do not know how much trouble he has gone through due to our complaint, but his father, spotboy and hairdresser have been harassed for years because of his FIR
 "tanushri ne 10 saal puraane ek maamle kaa zikr karte hue kaha, "naanaa patekar jabaran kareeb aana chaahate the, ve shooting ke dauraan gane kaa hissaa nahin the, baavjood unhone unke saath intimet hone kii koshish kii
 "gurmeet's image was also different, but when the truth came out
 
 
 tanushri ne kaha ki aise maamalon main kisi kii image par nahin janaa chahie
 Someone can be a good actor outside, but it cannot be judged personally how the character is
 gurmeet ramarhim or tamaam baabaaon kii bhi puja hoti thi, ve bhagwaan maane jate the, lekin dekhie baad main kya asaliyat saamne ai
 Tanushree said that she still did not want to speak on the matter, but when a journalist questioned her about Meetu during the interview, she had to mention the incident with her
 bataa den ki tanushri ne ek intervyuu main 2008 main ek film kii shooting ke dauraan apane saath jor jabardastee kii koshish kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Tanushree said that the song's choreographer Ganesh Acharya, director Rakesh Sarang and producer Sami Siddiqui are all aware of this, but nobody did anything
 maamle parganesh acharyane kya kaha?udhar, tanushri ke aaropon ko acharya ne khaarij karte hue kaha - sabase pehle to yah ki ye kaaphi purana vakya he, isliye mujhe thik se sab kuch yaad nahin
 But it was a dual song, as far as i remember something happened that day, due to which the shooting was stopped for three hours
 kuch miunderstanding hui thi
 But i can say that it is a false statement that Nana had called the people of the political party
 aisa nahin hua
 Acharya also denied that it was a solo song and Nana wanted to force it
 acharya ne kaha ki ye shuru se hi dual song tha
 Nana was a part of it
 unhone kaha tanushri galat bol rahi hai ki unke kaaran unhen film main kaam mila
 Acharya said, Nana is a sweet person
 ve aisa nahin kar sakate
 They help others and there are many artists, for whom Nana has come forward to help
 ve aisa nahin kar sakate
 Let us know that Tanushree Nenana Patekar had made many allegations in a press conference in 2008
 jiske jawaab main naanaa ne kaha tha, "tanushri meri beti kii umr kii hai, vah is tarah kii baaten kyon kar rahi hai main nahin jaanata
 i will be working in the industry for 35 years, but no one has ever made such allegations against me
 "TOI kii ek report ke mutabik, tanushri ne saal 2008 main CINTAA main naanaa patekar ke khilaaf unki property or khyaati ko nuksaan pahunchane kii shikaayat bhi darj karwaai thi
 Tanushree was also replaced by Rakhi Sawant in the film for raising her voice against Nana Patekar
 mejabaan dakshin africa ko 22 sitambar se shuru hone vaali isisi champions trophy main khitaab kaa prabal daavedaar bataane vaale wasim akram or sanjay manjrekar ne kaha ki bharat kii gendbaaji uskaa kamjor paksh he jiske kaaran uskaa daawa thodaa kamjor pad gaya he
 In the event held here in connection with the unveiling of the Champion Champions Trophy, these two veterans of India believed that India will miss the left-arm fast bowler Zaheer Khan in this tournament in South Africa which will be caused by a shoulder injury
 Are recovering
 purv bhartiya test cricketer or ab camentator kii bhoomika nibhaane vaale manjrekar ne kaha ki gendbaaji bharat kaa kamjor paksh he or uske ballebaajon ko isaki bharpaayi kerani pad rahi he
 In the absence of Zaheer, the Indian fast attack has weakened and in such a situation there will be a lot of pressure on Harbhajan
 nehra or ishanth kii jimmedaari badhipakistan ke purv captain akram ne bhi unki haa main haa milaayi lekin saath hi kaha ki yadi ishanth sharma wicket se adhik dur hatakar gendbaaji nahin karen to unka lanbaa kad dakshin africa pichon par unke liye madadgaar ban saktaa he
 Akram said that i agree with Sanjay
 jahir ke baahar hone se bhartiya tej akraman kamjor hua he
 In such a situation, the responsibility of Ashish Nehra and Ishant Sharma has increased

 City Superintendent of Police Man Singh Chauhan said, 'we are trying to trace the missing cellphone
 ’ bataaya jaataa he ki buudhvaar ko jab police professor seeras ke kamare kaa darwaja todakar andar gayi to cellphone unke pairon ke najadik padaa tha
 Chauhan said that at the time of the recovery of the body of Sirus, a sample of the food found in the kitchen has been taken for examination
 unhone kaha ki police unki maut ke sambandh main kisi bhi sambhaavna ko nakaar nahin rahi he kyonki postmortem report kisi nattejey tak nahin pahunch paayi he
 Meanwhile, a case was registered last night against six people on the orders of the Chief Judicial Magistrate
 seeras ne aatmahatya se pehle adaalat kaa darwaja khatkhataya tha
 Chauhan said that the FIR included the names of six people including the university's proctor Zubair Khan, the vice-chancellor's media advisor Prof

 loksabhaa chunaav main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii aguwai main bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party (sapa) or bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ko karaari maat di
 Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati together could not stop modi-shah's victory chariot
 sapa-basapa ko karaari shikast dene ke baad ab bijepi ne unke kor vot bank par nigahen gada di hai
 In the membership campaign that the party will run in the state, the focus will be more on Jatav of BSP and Yadav vote bank of SP

 Only those associated with Saifai clan of Yadav community continued to reap the benefits while Yadav of Ghazipur and Gorakhpur remained neglected
 treepathi kehete hai ki bijepi ne is baat ko behatar tareeke se samajhate hue pradhanmantri awaas yojana ho yaa phir ujjwala yojana ke tahat gas yaa muft main bijli conection ho bina fark sabhi samudaay ko dene kaa kaam kiya he
 Be it the people of the Yadav community or the Jatav community
 isi kaa nateeja he ki wo saare log voter ke rup main bijepi ke saath loksabhaa chunaav main jude hai
 In such a situation, we are trying to make them BJP members and workers
 bijepi maanati he ki upi main achche pradarshan ke baavjood alpsankhyak, jatav or yadav bahul booth par use paryaapt vot nahin mili
 Membership campaigns will be conducted at these booths to overthrow the caste system of SP-BSP
 bijepi ne loksabhaa chunaav se pehle uttar pradesh main alag-alag jatiyon ke sammelan kiye the
 The BJP also organized the Yadav community in Lucknow
 yahi nahin 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ne 11 yadavon ko tikat diya tha, jinamein se 9 jite bhi or yogi sarkaar main ek ko mantrimandal main bhi shaamil kiya gaya
 The Yadav community has 10 per cent of the vote in UP and the Jatavs have 14 per cent
 in maton ke sahare sapa or basapa satta par virajman hoti rahi hai
 However, in this year's Lok Sabha elections, the SP-BSP together could win only 15 seats
 iske baad mayawati ne aarope lagaaya ki yadav samudaay ne mahagathbandhan ko vot nahin kiya he
 Mayawati has said this to the Yadav community
 sapa ke netaa bhi maan rahe hai ki is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main basapa ke dalit vot ekamusth unhen nahin mili
 As a result, Dharmendra Yadav from Badaun, Dimple Yadav from Kannauj and Akshay Yadav from Firozabad lost the election

 In the politics of three generations of 'thackeray family', this is the first time that Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray's son Aditya Thackeray has come to the polls
 aditya ne mumbai kii varli vidhansabha seat se namakan patr daakhil kiya
 Aditya Thackeray, who lives in Bandra area of mumbai, has a well thought-out strategy behind contesting from the Worli assembly constituency instead of contesting the Bandra seat
 isiilie varli seat se shivasena ke maujuuda vidhayak sunil scindia ne aditya thakare ke chunavi maidan main utarane kii ichha ko dekhte hue apni daavedaari ko chhod diya he
 This seat is considered to be quite safe for Aditya Thackeray, considered the political successor of Shiv Sena
 1
 The strong fort of Shiv Sena The Worli assembly seat of Mumbai is considered a strong stronghold of Shiv Sena
 1990 main shivasena ne pehali baar jeet darj kii thi
 After this the series continued till 2004
 2009 main ensipi ne khaataa kholaa tha, lekin 2014 main shivasena ne ek baar phir kabja jamaa liya tha
 All 6 councilors who fall inside the assembly constituency belong to the Shiv Sena
 yahi vajah he kithakare parivaar kii raajnneetik sanbhaalane vaale aditya thakrene varli seat se chunavi pari khilne ke liye utar rahe hai

 loksabhaa chunaav main shivasena ko badi leadwarli vidhansabha seat mumbai dakshin sansadeey seat ke tahat aati he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant defeated Congress veteran Milling Deora by more than one lakh votes
 isse badi baat yah thi ki is loksabhaa seat ke tahat aane vaali varli vidhansabha kshetra se arvind saavant ko 38 hajaar maton kii lead mili thi
 Arvind Sawant is the Union Minister in the Modi government
 aise main aditya thakare ko varli seat se chunavi maidan main utarane se bada phayda ho saktaa he

 marathiyon or elite class voter kingmekarvarly vidhansabha seat paramaratha samudaay ke voter kingmekarki bhoomika main he
 Apart from this, this area is considered to be very high profile, there are many big corporate company offices in this area
 aditya thakare kii chhavi jis tarah kii rahi he, aise main vah elite class ke saath marathi logon ke saath khud ko behatar tareeke se conect kar pate hai
 In such a situation, the Shiv Sena may also be able to win the elite class vote

 Shiv Sena's occupation of Worli is currently MLA from Shiv Sena's Sunil Shinde
 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main sunil scindia ko 60625 vot mili the
 He defeated NCP leader and former minister Sachin Ahir by more than 23 thousand votes
 jabaki bijepi ne bhi apana pratyaashee utaara tha
 Despite this, Shiv Sena had won a big victory in this seat
 itnaa hi nahin 2009 main shivasena ko is seat par haraane vaale ensipi se haraane vaale sachin ahir ne haal hi main shivasena kaa daaman tham liya he, jiske chalate varli seat se aditya thakare kii raah ko aasaan bana diya he

 bandra east seat par muslim voter nirnaayakaditya thakare kaa ghar mumbai ke bandra east vidhansabha kshetra main aata he
 The Bandra East assembly seat consists of a large Muslim community, which is not originally considered a Shiv Sena voter
 aise main aditya thakare ke bandra seat se utarane par muslim matadaata unki jeet kii raah main roda ban sakate the
 Perhaps that is why Aditya Thackeray has decided to contest from Worli seat instead of Bandra

 Targeting the Congress, Rajnath Singh said, 'sonia said that the entire Congress party is standing with Manmohan Singh

 'rahul gandhi ko naseehat dete hue unhone kaha, 'jis adhyadesh ko pradhanmantri or unki cabinet ke paas kiya

 When the Prime Minister has gone abroad, no party should make such a statement nor insult him
 yah pradhanmantri hi nahin puure desh kaa apmaan he
 'defending his party, Rajnath Singh said,' PM was insulted not by BJP but by Congress vice-president
 agar sonia gandhi ise lekar chintit hai to sabase pehle rahul gandhi kaa istipha lenaa chahie or unhen puure desh ke saamne maafee maangane ke liye kahana chahie

 unhone kaha ki samvidhan anuchhed 50 ke tahat nyaaypalika ko karypalika se alag karte hue ek spasht simakan ko manyata detaa he, jo swasth nyaayik pranali ke liye antarnihit shakti he
 "it is relevant to mention here that Article 50 of the Directive Principles of State Policy under the Constitution is applicable not only to the lower courts, but also to the higher courts as the power separation principle and the independence of the judiciary are the basic principles of the Constitution," Kapoor said

 According to the affidavit that the BCCI filed in the Supreme Court in the month of March, Anurag Thakur has been a big cricketer like Dilip Vengsarkar, Shivlal Yadav and Brajesh Patel who is now working to groom BCCI Indian cricket
 yah or baat he ki vengsarakar ne 100 se zyaada test match khele hai or anuraag thakur ne sirf ek first class match

 In 2000, at the young age of 25, he was elected President of Himachal Cricket Association under the umbrella of his father Prem Kumar Dhumal
 magar unhen bisisiai main koi bada pad chahie tha or unhen har haal main pratham shrenee cricket bhi khelnaa tha

 isliye usee saal adhyaksh rahete hue vah ek din maidan pahunche or elaan kar diya ki vah us match main na keval team main khelenge balki vah us team kii captaini bhi karenge
 Whoever spoke, he dies, that's why no one rejected Anurag Thakur's words

 He played in that match against Jammu and Kashmir, but could not even open his account with the bat
 vah 7 gend tak maidan par rahe lekin ek bhi ran nahin bana paae
 However, in bowling, he saved the entire embarrassment by dismissing two tail batsmen

 Therefore, the same year, when he was the chairman, he reached the ground one day and announced that he would not only play in the team in that match but he would also captain the team
 jo bolta, vah marataa, isiilie anuraag thakur ji kii baat ko kisi ne nahin nakaara

 jammu-kashmir ke khilaaf us match main vah khele, magar balle se apana khaataa bhi nahin khol paae
 He remained on the ground for 7 balls but could not score a single run

 Cricket came to the backfoot in Himachal Pradesh but Anurag Thakur started his journey in BCCI
 ab vah pratham shrenee ke khilaadi ban chuke the or isiilie vah pehle junior cricket main chayankarta bane or phir apane rajnatik rasookh ke sahare bisisiai ke sabase bade adhikari ban gaye hai

 march ke maheene main jo halafanama bisisiai ne supreme court main daakhil kiya uske hisaab se anuraag thakur dilip vengsarakar, shivlal yadav or brajesh patel jaise bade cricket khilaadi rahe hai jo ab bisisiai bhartiya cricket ko sanvaarane kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 It is another matter that Vengsarkar has played more than 100 Test matches and Anurag Thakur has only one first class match
 
 
 vah bhi sidhe captain banakar

 mind rox seshan:pehali baar ke voter, kaise chune apane janpratinidhispikar:deepender hooda, sanjay kaul, arvind kejarivalkaha ja rahaa he ki aagaamee vidhansabha or loksabhaa chunaavon main ve voter mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaayenge, jo haal hi main 18 saal ke hue hai or pehali baar matadhikaar kaa prayog karenge
 Congress MP Deepender Hooda, Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal and BJP spokesperson Sanjay Kaul spoke on the role and responsibility of first-time voters at the India Today Mind Rocks Summit-2013
 aaie jaanate hai teenon kii raay
 Deepender Hooda: Kejriwal and BJP also want to take the country forward
 There is dissatisfaction among the youth around the world for power and system
 ve ek majboot, faisla karne vaala netritv chaahate hai
 what did we do
 san 47 ke baad kya hua
 a constitution is made
 har aadmi ko vot dene kaa haq mila
 The first general elections were held in the country within five years of independence
 san 47 main prati vyakti aay 237 rupee thi
 Today it is 68 thousand
 jivan dar, sakshartaa dar badi he
 Tie, handle and tie a diverse country like India, it all happened due to the efforts of Panditji and Sardar Patel
 rajeev ji ne 21 saal kii bajaay voter kii umr ghataakar 18 saal kar di
 Panchayati Raj was brought
 green revolution laayaa gaya
 White Revolution brought
 hamane kiya he
 But this question is also valid whether we could not do more
 ham 9 saal se satta main hai
 7 in the last 9 years
 9 fisadi kii ausat jidipi rahi he
 The economy has tripled
 pichley saat barason main garibi main jis tarah kii kami ai he
 He has a record all over the world
 china bhi aisa nahin kar paaya
 The issue is which model we have to choose
 kuch log teji se tarakkee karen
 And everyone's figure will improve
 yaa sabaki chintaa kii jaae, aisa system banaaya jaae
 There is no atmosphere of political debate in the country today
 are ham vichaardhaara main alag ho sakate hai
 But there are no enemies
 arvind kejariwal kaa main sammaan karata hum vah raajnneetik prakriya main aae
 Whether you or BJP all want to take this country forward
 main kejariwal ko rajnatik shubhakamanaayen to nahin de saktaa
 But i can personally congratulate him for coming to the field
 maa kii farmaaish par banaaya auraton kaa daaru song 'ek gilaasi': hard korasanjay kaul: sachcha kaam or asli aam, aam aadmi ko nahin miltadeepender sahab ne itani baaten kahin
 So much praise
 ki kaise koi buraai kare
 Put so sweet that it gets stuck
 aadmi to vah achche hai
 But all this cannot be said for the party
 vah kehete hai ki ham sab ek saath hai
 Then why is there a fight in Parliament
 aap hamen communal kyon bataate hai
 If everyone's intentions are right, then why should they not be what they are
 padhai kaa ek maamla he
 Nobody would say that everyone should be right to education
 is par koun vivaad karegaa
 But why this did not happen
 to hooda sahab ye kaaphi nahin ki aapaki niyat or ishaare sahi hon
 It is important that your model is correct
 ye jaruri he ki aap nirnay le sakate hai
 The condition of the country is that at first the job is not available
 milti he to rahati nahin he
 The university is far from becoming new, the ones that are getting worse
 akhbaar main khabar milti he ki ye falaan college kaa student he, ise itane karod kii naukari mil gai
 The country will see the picture of Bahadur Jyoti, mother said - My daughter did not do anything wrong, why hide common work and the common man does not get the real mango
 to usee kaa nateeja he kejariwal ji
 His Aam Aadmi Party
 abhi unhone haath par haath rakh prem se kaha
 Come on man
 maine bhi kaha
 Dude, i would have come, but you would not be able to remove
 maine apni sari soch baandhakar ek party chun lee
 There are good bad people in every party
 system bahut gaharaai tak jaataa he
 So for change, you have to go deep
 gussa mujhamen bhi he
 But i want to see the result
 aapako chahie ek aisi party ke saath judakar kaam karnaa, jiske paas narendra modi jaisaa leader ho
 Do whatever you say agar nahin kar paae to eemaandaaree se kahe ki ye nahin ho paaya
 But will do it further
 arvind kejariwal: main de rahaa hum apane candidet kii eemaandaaree kii guarantee(aate hi buland aawaaj main bharat mata kii jai, inkulab jindabad or vande maataram ke naare lagaate hai)deepender hooda ne bahut acchhee baat kahi ki arvind kejariwal kii party kii niyat saaf he
 We are happy that he accepts it
 unhone kaha vichaar alag hai
 We agree
 ek samay congress kii vichaardhaara patel, gandhi or shastri tay karte the
 But today Congress ideology Robert Vadra decides
 dilli main bijepi kii vichaardhaara vijay goyal tay karte hai or isliye aam aadmi ko apni party banani padi
 What was Anna ji asking for two years ago
 aisa janalokapal bill jo bhrashtachariyon ko sajaa de
 After the 13-day fast, all the parties said that you should finish it
 ham bill paas kar denge
 i have not seen women rioting till date: It has been two years since Kiran Bedias
 piem ne dhokhaa diya
 All parties sitting in Parliament cheated
 kamjor lokapal bhi nahin laa paae
 Everyone is afraid
 sabhi party darati hai
 Congress, BJP, Mayawati, Jayalalithaa every party has stolen
 aaj agar anna vaala lokapal paas kar den to aadhe se zyada netaa tihaad main honge
 a dream is going to come true
 november main aam aadmi party baari bahumat se chunaav jeetne vaali he
 Within 15 days of winning, the same Lokpal bill will be passed, for which Anna, you all agitated
 aajkal ham log candidet khadey kar rahe hai
 Everybody asks that Arvind you are honest
 magar 70 candidet kii kya guarantee dete ho
 i am guaranteeing
 mindrocks main bole liender pes, bachapan main footballar bananaa chahta thacongress ke 16 vidhayak, bijepi ke 9 vidhayak aise baithe hai
 Those who are on trial for murder and rape
 isiilie aam aadmi party chun-chunakar achche logon ko tikat de rahi he
 But maybe something goes wrong
 agar ek din pehle bhi koi aap ke ummidavaar ke khilaaf subut laa de, to ham use chunaav nahin ladane denge
 Will leave the seat vacant, but will not know the broker in the legislature
 jab maine raajnneeti jwine kii, logon ne kaha keechad hai
 People said that i cheated Anna
 maine dhokhaa nahin diya
 i argued with him
 maine kaha ki sab kuch karke dekh liya
 nothing happen
 system main janaa padega
 Anna said there is mud
 hamane kaha koi nahin, shaayad yahi qurbaani chahie, to ham izzat bhi daanv par laga denge
 When Nehru Patel used to do politics
 koi raajnneeti main jaataa tha, to log kehete the ki desh seva karne ja rahaa he
 Today, if someone says this, people say that earning money is going to be brokerage
 raajnneeti karnaa bahut pavitra cheez he
 i fasted in Delhi
 kaha ki agar hamaari sarkaar bani to bijli kaa bill 50 fisadi kam hoga
 BJP said they will reduce it by 30 percent
 ek patrkaar mitra ne majaak main bataaya ki goyal ji 50 kam nahin kar sakate
 They also own 20 percent
 hamane mutthi baandhi to sabane baandh lee he
 But the country is watching
 sawaal-jawaservind kejariwal baaten badi badi karaten hai
 Your people are also accused
 kejariwal:sarkaar congress bijepi waalon kii he
 Everyone has got the investigation done
 kuch nahin mila inhen
 He kept saying repeatedly that funds come from abroad
 inhone court main kaha ki videsh se paisa aa rahaa he
 Then Red Marie
 aakhri main kahana padaa koi paisa baahar se nahin aa rahaa he
 The country needs a decision-making leader
 manmohan se log naaraaz hai
 Rahul does not come forward, your leader does not see hunger
 deepender hoodahhar vyakti kaa kaam karne kaa tarika alag alag hota he
 In the last seven to eight years, i got a chance to work closely with Rahul ji
 or main ye kah saktaa hum ki unki jo kamitment he, vichaardhaara ke prati, vah maine bahut kam logon main dekhi he
 With him, he takes the way to bring his thoughts to the end
 rahul ji kii vichaardhaara kaa kisaanon ke liye, garibon ke liye
 Some believe about Modi, who will not run his party, what will the country run
 to aap kyon maanate hai ki ye desh ko modi chalaa paaenge
 Sanjay: Your question is wrong
 party main ekta kii baat 15 din pehle hoti to thik tha
 Now the party has decided together
 is baat ko mat bhuuliye ki pehali baar party sanghathan ke har str bahes ke baad narendra modi kaa naam tay hua
 You should celebrate it
 jahaan baat rahul kii he, jab kahin kuch thik hota dikhataa he to sab kores main gane lagate hai unki jayakaar
 Where there is a mess, there is talk of collective responsibility
 rahul gandhi or modi kii lokapriyata main antar?deepender hooda:ladakiyon ke vot main rahul gandhi aage hai or ve zyada samajhadaar hoti hai
 There is a difference between us and their ideology
 ham chaahate hai ki vikaas kaa phayda sabakaa ho
 We do not want India Shining
 ham bharat nirmaan chaahate hai
 People have given us a mandate in favor of this ideology for two consecutive times
 aaj main aapse sawaal poochna chahta hum ki gujarat jo vikaas kii baat karata he
 The laborer gives the lowest wages
 ham us majdoor kii baat karte hai
 Let's worry vanshavaad he raajnneeti main, aapke yahaan bhi he?deepender hooda:raajnneeti kaa jo system he
 If you come from a political family, then you get an advantage
 main jab pehali baar chunaav ladaa to profeshnal tha
 Of engineering
 infosis kii naukari kii
 The first time he contested, he won by a quarter of a million votes

 The story of the film 'aankhen Dekhi' is from a family in Old Delhi who are unique, unique
 yah sirf ek film nahin, balki ek soch he, insaan kii jindagi ke rangon ke anubhav kii or antaratma kii khushi kii
 Sanjay Mishra, who is playing the character of Babuji, also has a thinking, according to which he believes what he sees
 aamtaur par darshakon ko hansaane vaale sanjay mishra ne babuji ke kirdaar main jaan daal di he
 Seema Pahwa has played the role of his wife on screen
 film main jitne bhi chote-bade kirdaar hai, sabhi apane apane role main behtareen hai
 Usually, whenever people see Delhi in films, Punjabis are seen in Delhi, but director Rajat Kapoor has portrayed the real old Delhi very beautifully
 do ghante theatre ke andar mujhe aisa laga ki main vaaki main puraani dilli ke ek parivaar ke bich maujuud hum
 i got involved in their quarrels, their arguments, their wedding and their emotions
 har insaan kii soch or samaj alag hoti he, unamem main bhi shaamil hum
 
 
 It is possible that what i thought after seeing 'aankhon Dekhi' is different from what others think
 film main baar-baar bataane kii koshish kii gai he jindagi ke anubhavon ko apni ankhon dekhi par yakeen karne ko, magar meri soch film dekhte vakt yah sawaal puuchhati rahi ki koi bhi insaan apni khushi ke liye kis had tak ja saktaa he

 With such a system, all political parties will be able to use their energy more in the development and welfare of the people according to their ideology

 The Central Government has stepped up efforts to bring back black money
 bharat sarkaar kii ore se switzraland ko is bare main chitthee likhi jaaegi
 Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley gave this information
 jetali ne somvaar ko kaha, 'kai jagah aisi khabar ai he ki swiss athurity bharat sarkaar ke saath sahyog ke liye taiyaar hai
 They are willing to give details of Indians who have accounts in Swiss banking system
 lekin vitt mantralay ko is bare main switzraland se koi aupchaarik soochna nahin mili he
 But today we are writing to the Swiss administration by ourselves and asking for its procedure
 'switzraland main taiyaar ho chuki he suchi!isse pehle ravivaar ko khabar ai thi ki switzraland sarkaar ne aise sandigdh bharatiyon kii suchi taiyaar kii he jinhone kaala dhan swiss bainkon main jamaa kiya hua he or swiss adhikari ise bharat sarkaar se saajha karne par vichaar kar rahe hai
 a senior Swiss government official said that the names of these Indians and entities have been revealed in a government inquiry to identify the real beneficiaries of the funds held in various banks operating in the country
 adhikari ne kaha, 'andeh he ki in logon va ikaayiyon ne nyaason, domicilieri companiyon tathaa bharat se baahar duusari gaiyrkanoonee ikaayiyon ke jariye bina kar chukaaya dhan swiss bainkon main rakhaa he
 'will not tell the name and amount? However, the officer did not tell about these people or units and their deposits
 adhikari ne gopneeyata praavdhaan tathaa donon deshon ke bich dwipaksheeya soochna aadan-pradaan sandhi kaa hawala dete hue byoraa dene se inkaar kiya
 The official further said that Swiss officials are ready to work closely with the new government of India and they will extend all necessary support to the newly formed Special Investigation Team (SIT) on black money
 haalanki, adhikari ne in daavon ko khaarij kar diya ki swiss bainkon main jamaa bhartiya dhan hajaaron arab dollar he
 According to the latest figures of Swiss National Bank, the total deposits of foreign customers in the country's 283 banks is only $ 1,600 billion
 swiss bainkon main jamaa bharatiyon kaa dhan badhkar 2
 On reaching 03 billion Swiss francs (rs 14,000 crore), he said that this money belongs to customers who have declared themselves as Indian, so it is unlikely to be illegal money
 HSBC se alag he yah soocheeis varisht adhikari ne kaha ki bharat ke saath byoraa lagaataar saajha kiya ja rahaa he
 And this is different from information previously sought by Indian authorities based on leaked or stolen list or 'HSBC list'
 swiss sarkaar echesbisi kii suchi ke aadhaar par bharatiyon kaa byoraa dene se lagaataar inkaar karti rahi he
 The list was stolen by a bank employee and later passed on to tax officials from other countries including India
 bharat ke kai baar aagrah karne ke baavjood switzraland ne soochna dene se inkaar karte hue kaha tha ki uskaa sthaneey kanoon gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se praapt soochna ke aadhaar par byoraa dene se roktaa he
 In this purported list of HSBC, Indians and people from other countries who had black money in the Swiss unit of the bank were named

 Murali Vijay missed out on a century by just one run in the Adelaide Test, and now in the Brisbane Test he could not record the record of the greatest innings of any Indian at this ground with a margin of just one run
 varsh 2003-04 main saurav ganguli ne brisben ke maidan par 144 ran banaae the, or buudhvaar ko murali vijay bhi isi score par out ho gaye
 However Murali Vijay has become only the fourth batsman to score a century at MLA Brisbane's Gaba Maidan after ML Jayasimha, Sunil Gavaskar and Sourav Ganguly, and yes, Murali Vijay has also completed his 2,000 runs in Test cricket during this innings
 ullekhneey he ki murali vijay edilade test kii duusari pari main mahaj ek ran se shatak se chook gaye the, or unke out hone ke saath hi jeet kii ore bad rahi bhartiya pari ladkadaa gai thi, so, brisben test ke dauraan shaayad murali ko apni us chook kaa ehsaas tha, isliye unhone pari kii shuruyaat se hi wicket par tikne ko lakshya banaaya
 Although luck also supported him well during this period, Murali's intention was to stay on the wicket and that is why Murali completed the fifth century of his Test career
 ek ballebaaz ke taur par murali vijay kii ballebaazi kii style bahut aakarshak nahin he, lekin wicket par tikne or ran banane kii kaabiliyat unamem he
 His difficulty in playing short pitch balls also comes to the fore, but Murali's batting specialty is that if he stays on the wicket, the runs come automatically
 team india ko test maichon main isi tarah ke salaami ballebaaj kii jarurat he, kyonki test main aise ballebaaz kii apni ahmiyat hi hoti he, or yahi vajah he ki badhati umr ke baavjood murali vijay test team main niyamit taur par bane hue hai
 a few months ago, when India's legendary batsman was bowling in England, Murali Vijay scored a convincing century in Nottingham
 isse pehle unke teenon test shatak australia ke khilaaf hi bane the, lekin gharelu maidan par
 But on this Australian tour, he has proved to be a great success from Team India so far
 edilade kii donon pariyon main ardhshtak banane ke baad brisben main unka shatak bataata he ki is series main team india ko opening ko lekar chintaa nahin kerani hogi

 sab depend karata he ki kaisaa kab kya maahaul he hamaare saamne
 On which to decide
 pakistan ke saath game khelnaa chahie nahin khelnaa chahie
 i cannot say anything about it
 kyonki kab toornament hoga, kab match hoga
 Depends on it
 vijay goyal kaa yah bhi kahana he ki imidietli to ham nahin kah sakate hai ki hamaare saamne match he
 Understand one thing when the teams are participating in the tournament and if four teams have qualified
 agar usamen bharat kii he or pakistan bhi he to jaahir taur par agar aap nahin khelenge to usamen se aap ko baahar aana padegaa to thodaa mushkil ho jaataa he

 pakistan ke saath khilne ke bare main vijay goyal kaa kahana he ki yah sirf hamaari mantralay kaa nahin he
 This is the case of the Federation
 yah unako dyside karnaa he jab bhi ham kisi videshi team ke saath khelte hai to usamen videsh mantralay, home ministry or duusari consarn ministry teenon shaamil hoti hai or sab milakar hi nirnay karte hai

 Till then the relationship with Pakistan cannot remain
 aise main unke saath kisi prakaar kii saanskrithik aadan-pradaan nahin hota
 If this continues, then obviously all these things also become difficult

 ) telecom sector ke diggaj sunil bharti mittal ne shanivaar ko kaha ki, bharat ko bhi fasebuk or google ko sirf isliye roak laga deni chahie kyonki ye donon america companiyaan hai
 Mittal said that he is not too worried about American protectionism as his business is completely based on the Indian market, but it is totally wrong to stop Indian workers from going to the US when foreign companies are making huge profits in India
 darasal trump ke netritv main america kuch zyada hi sangrakshanvaadi ho gaya he
 It is worth noting that Mittal said, 'if such situations arise in front of you that the entry of skilled workers to speed up the economy should be banned or Indian companies should be forced to give a special salary only to them
 If you do not avoid competition in countries, then i think it is unfair action against companies who want to do business in America
 'darasal, mittal se yah poocha gaya tha ki agar unakicompany airtalko kisi khaas desh main pravesh nahin diya jaae to unki pratikriya kya hogi? isi sawaal par mittal ne google, fasebuk or watsap kaa udhaaharan diya jinke bharat main karodon yujar hai
 Quoting these, Mittal asked whether these companies should be allowed to operate in India even when similar apps are from Indian companies as well
 Sunil Bharti Mittal said, "wherever Facebook's 20 crore, whatsapp 150 million and Google's 100 million customers are in India, so should we say that we don't want Facebook and Google to operate in India because we have our own apps

 The ongoing controversy over the terms and conditions of the 15th Finance Commission is not taking its name
 khaskar dakshin bharat ke rajya iskaa kadaa virodh kar rahe hai
 On Wednesday, Andhra Pradesh Finance Minister Yanmala Ramakrishnudu has once again sharply criticized the Modi government at the Center over the matter
 unhone kaha ki aaj bijepi satta main hai or kal koi duusari party satta main hogi
 Though it does not matter who is in power, the basic structure of the Constitution should not be violated at all
 is dauraan unhone yah bhi kaha ki prayek rajya par apane adhikaron kii suraksha karne kii jimmedaari he
 All parties should separate their politics and raise their voice on this issue simultaneously
 andhra pradesh ke vittamantri ne kaha ki 15wein vitt ayog ke niyamon or sharton ko lekar deshbhar main charchaa honi chahie
 If it is implemented exactly like this, then progressive states will be badly affected by this
 unhone vitt ayog ke in niyam or sharton ko rajyon ke mul vittiya dhaanche ko nuksaane pahunchane kii badi sajeesh qaraar diya
 Today, there's BJP in power, tomorrow others might come
 No matter who's in power, basic structure of constitution mustn't be violated
 Responsibility is on every state to protect its rights
 All parties must respond on the issue keeping their politics aside: Andhra Finance Min— ANI (@ani)may 9, 2018ramkrishnudu ne kaha ki isseandhra pradesh, tamilnadu, pashchim bengal, odisha or karnataka ko ek lakh 14 hajaar 62 karod rupee kaa nuksaan hoga
 He said that in this regard, we had appealed to the central government to organize a conclave of finance ministers, but sadly, there was no response from Modi government
 centre sarkaar ko rajyon ko unke adhikaron se kisi bhi haalat main vanchit nahin karnaa chahie
 Earlier, former Union Finance Minister p Chidambaram, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister n Chandrababu Naidu had opposed the terms and conditions of the 15th Finance Commission
 naidu ne kaha tha ki agar kendriya kosh ke vitaran ke liye 2011 kii janaganana ko aadhaar banaaya jaataa he, to un pragatisheel rajyon ko baari nuksaan hoga, jinhone apni aabaadi ko niyantrit kiya he
 He said that the Center should respect the federal structure of cooperatives
 kai rajyon kii maang he ki kosh kaa bantwaaraa 1971 kii janaganana ke anusaar ho
 Naidu had said that it would not be appropriate to punish the states which are ahead in population control by distributing the central fund based on the 2011 census
 ham is anyaay ko bardaasht nahin karenge
 We will struggle till we get justice
 unhone kaha tha ki jansankhya niyantran main kerala sabhi rajyon se aage he
 Andhra Pradesh has also taken steps for population control
 agar nirvachan kshetron kaa parisemen 2011 kii jansankhya ke hisaab se kiya jayega, to dakshin bharat ke rajyon ko siten ganvaani padengi
 Apart from Andhra Pradesh, Puducherry, West Bengal, Punjab, Kerala and Delhi are also opposed to the terms and conditions of the 15th Finance Commission
 isaki mukhaalafat karte hue purv kendriya vittamantri pi chidambaram ne in chah rajyon or centre shasit pradeshon kii ore se darj karaae gaye virodh kaa swaagat kiya he
 He also said that other states should also oppose the terms and conditions of the 15th Finance Commission
 in rajyon kaa tark he ki 2011 kii janaganana ke aadhaar par kosh ke bantwaare se un rajyon ko phayda hoga, jo apane yahaan badhati aabaadi ko rokane main asafal rahe hai
 Today, eid-ul-azha (bakrid) festival is being celebrated with great enthusiasm across the country
 islamic manyata ke anusaar id-ul-juha hazrat ibrahim kii qurbaani kii yaad main manaaya jaataa he
 On the occasion of eid-ul-azha, in the Muslim religion, along with offering Namaz, animals are also sacrificed
 islam ke anusaar, muslim dharm ke log allaah kii raja ke liye qurbaani karte hai
 However, in Islam, sacrifice is considered justified only with the money earned in the manner of halal
 aaie jaanate hai ki bakreed par aakhir kyon di jaati he qurbaani or qurbaani ke gosht ko puraa kyon nahin apane paas rakhaa jaataa
 Importance of sacrifice in Islam - In Islam, the importance of sacrifice is said to be of great importance
 quran ke anusaar kaha jaataa he ki ek baar allaah ne hazrat ibrahim kii pariksha leni chaahi
 He ordered Hazrat Ibrahim to sacrifice his most beloved thing to him
 hazrat ibrahim ko unke bete hazrat ismil sabase zyada pyaare the
 After Allah's order, Hazrat Ibrahim told this to his son Hazrat Ismail
 bataa den, hazrat ibrahim ko 80 saal kii umr main aulad naseeb hui thi
 After which it was very difficult for him to sacrifice his son
 lekin hazrat ibrahim ne allaah ke hukum or bete kii muhabbat main se allaah ke hukum ko chunate hue bete kii qurbaani dene kaa faisla kiya
 Hazrat Ibrahim took the name of Allah and stabbed his son's throat
 lekin jab unhone apni aankh kholi to dekha ki unka betaa bagal main jinda khadaa he or uski jagah bakre jaisi shakl kaa jaanavar kataa hua leta hua he
 After this, sacrifice began in the path of Allah
 qurbaani kaa puraa gosht nahin rakh sakate-islam main qurbaani ke gosht ko akelaa koi parivaar apane liye nahin rakh saktaa
 Three parts of the sacrificial meat are performed
 jiskaa pehla hissaa garibon ke liye hota he
 The second part is for friends and relatives and the third part is for their home
 shaitan par kyon maare jate hai pathar-islam main haj yatra ke aakhri din qurbaani dene ke baad ramijamaraat pahunch kar shaitan ko pathar maarane kii bhi ek anokhi parampara he
 This tradition is said to be associated with Hazrat Ibrahim
 mana jaataa he ki jab hazrat ibrahim allaah ko apane bete kii qurbaani dene ke liye chale the to raste main shaitan ne unhen bahakaane kii koshish kii thi
 This is the reason that Hajayatri hit the stone pebbles on those three pillars symbolizing the devil
 qurbaani kaa niyam kis par vaazib-islam main qurbaani ke niyam us shaks par lagu hote hai jisaki haisiyat qurbaani dene kii hoti he
 a person who, despite being strong, does not sacrifice in the Raza of Allah is one of the criminals
 kitne log milakar de sakate hai ek jaanavar kii qurbaani-qurbaani ke liye jaanwaron chunate samay par alag-alag hisse hai
 Where there are seven parts on a large animal (buffalo), there is only one part on small animals like goat
 matlab saaf he ki agar koi shaks bhens yaa oont kii qurbaani karaata he to usamen saat logon ko shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 At the same time, if he gives goat, it is only in the name of a person
 kaise jaanavar kii qurbaani kii jaati he-islam main aise jaanwaron kii qurbaani hi jaij maani jaati he jo jaanavar sehatmand hote hai
 If the animal has any kind of disease or discomfort, Allah does not agree with the sacrifice of such animal
 madhya pradesh sarkaar ek ke baad ek vivaadit masalon main fansati ja rahi he
 The pursuit of water satyagrahis was not left untouched that the program to be held in Sanchi on September 21, on the occasion of completion of 2,600 years of the enlightenment of Buddha, was still mired in controversies
 darasal, is kaarykram main baudgh study centre kii aadharshila rakhi jaani he, jiske liye srilanka ke raashtrapati mahinda rajpakshe ko khaas taur se aamantrit kiya gaya he

 srilanka main tamil hiton ke liye hameshaa se aawaaj uthaate rahe emdmake ke netaa vico ne is ghoshnaa par hairat jataate hue kaha, “rajpakshe srilanka main tamil logon kii hatya ke liye jimmedaar hai
 This case is related to the feelings of common people of Tamil Nadu
 yah ek gambhir masalaa he
 Due to which Rajapaksa should not be allowed to join the program
 ”vico ne mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko patr likhakar maang kii he ki rajpakshe ko sanchi ke kaarykram main hissaa lene se roka jaae, saath hi chetavanee bhare andaaj main yah bhi kaha ki agar aisa nahin kiya gaya to ve apane dher saare samarthakon ke saath sanchi pahunchakar rajpakshe kaa virodh karenge
 According to him, more than 3,000 Tamils from Tamil Nadu will reach Sanchi and show black flags to Rajapaksa
 tamilnadu kii anya partiyon ne bhi rajpakshe kii bhopal yatra ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaani shuru kar di he
 DMK chief Karunanidhi said in two words, "I am with those who opposed Rajapaksa's proposed visit
 ”tamaam chetavaniyon ko zyada mahatv na dete hue pradesh ke samskruti mantri lakshmikant sharma ne jataa diya ki virodhiyon ke tewaron ke baavjood kaarykram main kisi tarah kaa badlaav nahin kiya jayega
 He said, "program preparations are almost complete and we are fully prepared to welcome the guests
" ”is mudde par virdohi vichaardhaara vaali partiyaan ek saath khadi dikhaai de rahi hai
 State Congress Spokesperson Manak Aggarwal said his stand on Rajapaksa's visit, saying, "we welcome the President of Sri Lanka and we have no problem with his visit to Madhya Pradesh nor will we oppose it
" ”baudgh samaaj, jo is puure kaarykram ke centre main he, study centre ko lekar ho rahe vivaadon se khaasaa naakhush he
 Mohanlal Patil, state convenor of the Buddhist Society of India, says, "this method of protest is not right
" ” baudgh samaaj sanchi main rajpakshe ke khilaaf hone vaale kisi bhi virodh pradarshan kaa saath nahin degaa
 In Patil's words, "if Vaiko wants to oppose Rajapaksa, then Sanchi is not the right place for this
 unako chahie dilli jaakar apana virodh darj karavaaen
 Rajapaksa is coming for good work and we should welcome him
 ”is kaarykram main rajpakshe ke alaava anya deshon se bhi kai hyprophile log shaamil hone vaale hai
 Such as the Prime Minister of Bhutan, Lunpo Jigme Thinley and philosophers from many countries including China, Israel, Britain, France, Indonesia, Japan will also come here
 aise main jaraa-si chook duniya main bharat kii chhavi kharaab kar sakati he
 Therefore, the state government is taking full precaution
 isaki ek vajah 2013 main hone ja rahaa vidhansabha chunaav bhi he

 'wanted' or 'dabang' jaisi lagaataar do safal filmein de chuke salmaan kehete hai ki vah parde par naayakatv kii vaapasi ke liye sachet prayaas kar rahe hai
 Salman said, this is a conscious effort to bring those heroes back on screen, because i have been missing them for a long time
 main theatre janaa chahta hum, to vahaan apane nayak ko dekhnaa chahta hum
 We got used to it, but now the heroes have disappeared due to romance-oriented films
 main film vyavsaay main hum, isliye unhen waapas laa saktaa hum
 Salman says that when he decided to make 'dabangg', people had misunderstood his decision
 unhone kaha, 'dabang' aam logon ke liye banaai gai thi
 i was very discouraged about its title
 logon kaa kahana tha ki is sheershak kaa sahi uccharan bhi sabhi nahin kar sakenge yaa unhen iskaa matlab maaloom nahin hoga
 Due to Nayak being a policeman, budding actress, budding director, people believed that the film would not do and we would be ruined
 jab 'dabang' pradarshit hui to logon ko khub pasand ai or ise lekar jataai gai sari shankaaen bekaar sabit huin
 Now the audience is waiting for Salman's 'ready' and 'bodyguard' to perform

 ) Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) explosive batsman Andre Russell described his defeat in the Indian Premier League (IPL) match to Royal Challengers Bangalore on Friday as a 'sour-sweet' experience, sending himself to bat at lower order
 Expressed disappointment at the decision of jeet ke liye 214 ran ke lakshya kaa peechha karne utari keker kii shuruyaat kharaab rahi
 The team lost three wickets for 33 runs within five overs and then Robin Uthappa's innings of just nine runs in 20 balls made things more difficult

 He scored 65 off 25 balls with the help of nine sixes and two fours

 Outside the Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the opposition leaders who surrounded the government on demonetisation were reconciled with the Prime Minister before the House started
 khud pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi apni seat chhodkar tamaam netaaon se unke paas jaakar mil rahe the
 But all eyes were on the meeting of Modi and Sonia Gandhi
 modi sab se milte milaate congress bench kii taraf gaye or congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se unki seat par jaakar unka haalchaal janaa
 Sonia said to the PM - everything is fine
 Sonya also replied in the same manner that everything is fine
 pichley kaaphi samay se sonia gandhi kaa swasthya thik nahin tha
 She is rarely seen in public
 congress varking cameti kii meeting main bhi unhone tabiyat ke chalate hissaa nahin liya tha
 Just before the proceedings of the morning started, Prime Minister Narendra Modi left his seat in the Lok Sabha and went towards the seat of the leaders of the other parties and met all the leaders
 lekin pradhanmantri ne zyada samay congress netaa mallikarjun khadge ke saath baatcheet main bitaayaa
 Went to his seat from Modikhadge and was constantly talking to him
 us vakt sonia gandhi party ke baaki netaaon se mil rahi thim
 Modi was in a mood for laughter and it seemed that Modi was waiting for Sonia Gandhi to come to his seat and as soon as Sonia Gandhi came to her seat, Modi knew her well
 sonia ne bhi thik he kahkar jawaab diya or phir vah baaki netaaon se milane lagi
 Modi again after talking to Mallikarjun Kharge again went to Advani and started talking to him
 modi ne adwani ke paas khadey hokar unase kuch der baatcheet kii
 During this, Modi was also seen in the mood for laughter
 is prakaar sadan kii karrwai shuru hone se pehle loksabhaa ke pehle din kaa najaara aisa lag rahaa tha, jaise satta paksh or vipaksh ke bich sab thik thaak he
 But given the sharp opposition of the opposition to note closure, it is unlikely that this atmosphere will be seen again in the coming days
 aao mil jaao ki ye vaqt na paaoge kabhimain bhi ham-raah jamaane ke badal jaaounga
 
 
 
 daag dehalavi urdu ke aalaa shaayar the
 His real Nawab was Mirza Khan
 kehete hai ki unka janm 25 may, 1831 ko dilli main hua tha
 His father Shamsuddin Khan was the brother of Nawab Loharu
 jab daag chote hi the, tabhi pita kii mrityu ho gai
 Daug's mother later married Mirza Fakhru, son of Bahadur Shah 'zafar', the last emperor of the Mughals Sultanate
 iske baad daag dilli ke laal kile main rahane lage
 Here Daag got all kinds of education
 daag ko shaayari kaa shauk bhi yaheen laga
 He made Jauq his master
 dekhnaa hashr main jab tum pe machal jaaoongaamain bhi kya vaada tumhaara hoon ki tal jaaongaapane bheetar ke shaayar ke liye unhone daag naam chunaa tha, or dehalavi yani dilliwaala,ko unhone apana takhllus banaaya
 But they probably did not like the name Dag
 unka jivan bhi unke naam kii tarah hi dard, jakhm or bedakhli kii baangi se bharaa he
 The rebellion started in the second year of the death of Mirza Fakhru in 1856
 majabuuran daag ne dilli chhod diya, vah rampur chale gaye, lekin man se kabhi dilli ko bhul nahin paae
 This sorrow of relocation kept haunting him all his life
 daag dehalavi 1857 kii tabaahiyon se gujarey the
 He saw the sight of dead bodies in the streets of Delhi
 unki shaayari main dard or nayepan ke mishran kaa aisa ghol he, jise padhane ke baad lambey samay tak usamen khoe rahane kaa man karata he
 The poetry of Delhi is seen in his poetry
 choti umr main pita ko khone kaa dard, maa kii duusari shaadi, jis dilli se unhen behad lagaav, usee dilli se unki rukhsat, or jis pyaar ko unhone gale lagaana chaha us pyaar se bhi ruusavai
 
 
 Both Dag's life and his poetry are full of such philosophy
 aashiqui se milegaa i zaahidabandgi se khuda nahin miltakate hai, munnibai hijaab naamak ek gayika or tawaayph se daag kaa mashhoor ishk isi maahaul kii dein tha
 His Ishq Aashikana was less, Sufiana and Shairana were more
 daag aadhi sadi se adhik umr ji chuke the, jab munnibai unke jivan main ai
 If there was seriousness of poetry and thinking in the stain, then Munnibai Hijab would be the life of every lady
 unamem husn kaa gurur va javaani kaa jashn tha
 Then like every story of Ishaq, this love had a story too
 daag ne apane is ishk kii dastaan ko faryade daag main maje ke saath doharaaya bhi he
 Did not come even now, it became beautiful from kucha-e-dilbar, today the heart of Mirae Dil ki Aapamunnibai Hijab, this love of stain was both colorful and bayonet
 daag dehalavi jahaan munnibai hijaab ke husn par qurbaan the or munnibai nawab rampur ke chote bhai haidadli kii daulat par meharbaan thim
 It was difficult for Dehlavi to be able to live as Hyder Ali's Rakib in Rampur, but what would he do with his heart, there was no cherry in mind that he would have given up on ordering
 lihaaja jab munnibai hijaab ke ishk ne unhen sataana shuru kiya to unhone haidadli tak apana paigaam bhijwaya- 'daag hijaab ke tire najar kaa ghayal he
 There are other things to entertain you, but if you do not find the stained poor hijab, then it is said
 'dil hi to he na aae kyun dam hi to he na jaae kyunham ko khuda jo sabar de tujh sa haseen banaae kyunkahate hai vah daur hi kuch or tha
 Nawab Hyder Ali not only pardoned this scandal, but also responded to his letter, which Munnibai Hijab herself brought to him
 nawab haidadli ne likhaa tha- 'daag sahab, aapaki shaayari se zyaada hamen munnibai ajij nahin he
 'but Munnibai had her own ambitions, she could not live in the four walls of the house
 vah daag ke paas hijaab banakar ai jarur, lekin jald hi daag ko chhodkar waapas bazaar kii jinat ban gai
 It gives a peek to those who have a sorrow, where there is mourning, there is also mourning
 After the death of Nawab Rampur Kalbe Ali Khan in 1887, Dag Dehalvi also could not stay in Rampur for long
 vakt ne ek baar phir unke saath sitam kiya
 In old age, the stains came out in search of suitable land and sky
 kai shaharon kii dhul fanki or aakhir main vah hyderabad pahunche
 Dag Dehalvi was old by now
 kai bimariyon ne unhen gher liya tha
 It took more than three-and-a-half years to establish the stain in Hyderabad
 doston kii madad ke sahare unka vakt cat rahaa tha, par aisa kab tak chalata
 The compulsion led him to the Nawab's palace
 nawab mehboob ali khan ne unhen aadar diya or vah nawab ke ustad niyukt ho gaye
 When the news of this impressive and growing status of Dag Dehlavi reached Munnibai Hijab, Bai, who was married to her beauty, was surrounded by memories of old times
 vah apane pati se talaak lekar daag dehalavi ke paas hyderabad chali ain
 When Munnibai Hijab came to Hyderabad, Daag was 72 years old
 par unhone munnibai ko dutkaara nahin, balki use phir se apana liya
 Whether it was his nobility or love, i do not know
 bane hai jab se wo laila nai mahamil main rahete hanjise divaana karte hai usee ke dil main rahete hemhyderabad main hi saal 1905 main phaliz se daag dehalavi kii maut ho gai, or iske saath hi nawabi andaaj vaala ek mahaan shaayar is duniya se rukhsat kar gaya
 Today Dahig Dehalvi was relieved of the world even though it has been more than a year, but her poetry is still humming, alive and always will be

 Swara Bhaskar objected to the scene of Jauhar after watching Padmavat
 unhone film ke nirdeshak sanjay lila bhansaali ke naam ek open letters likhaa, jisamen aarope lagaaya ki bhansaali ne padmavat main stri ko vastu kii tarah pesh kiya
 Shahid Kapoor has reacted to this letter of Swara
 unhone ibi times se baat karte hue kaha he 'haa, swara ke letters kii mujhe jaankaree he
 But to be honest, i have not read it yet
 ye kaaphi lanbaa he
 i am quite busy these days
 mujhe nahin pataa unhen kya samasya he
 Perhaps there is an issue related to Sanjay sir

 iske baad unhone likhaa ki mahilaon ke paas vajaina hoti he
 This is the way of life because she can give life

 unhone aage likhaa ki kai actors, filmmekar or kalakaaron kaa lagata he ki wo aadhunik cinema main feminism kii nai paribhaasha dete hue logon ko rasta dikhaaenge
 In such a situation, they should remember the scenes shown in the recent cinema and understand the difference between truth and falsehood
 film ke drishy main dikhaaya gaya he ki ek mahila pati / premi se dhokhaa khaane ke baad haath main sharaab liye becoground main puraani film ke gane sunate hue galiyon main bhatak rahi he
 This view is similar to what men do when they are deceived in love

 The JNU from which the controversy has shaken the entire country for more than ten days, what is the truth of that JNU? Have some students of JNU really gone beyond all limits while doing politics in opposition to power? Is it really that JNU is becoming a refuge of traitor forces? This question is because in the last few days, some video clips of a program which came out of JNU has caused a stir in the country, but the reality is that now these video clips are surrounded by questions Are in audio-video ke saath chhedhchhadsawaal yah he ki kya do alag-alag dinon ke audio-video ke saath kisi ne chhedchhad kii he? kya donon din ke audio-video ko mila diya gaya he? kya media ke ek tabake ne jaanboojh kar usee farji audio-video ko chalaa diya? agar haa, to in sabase bada sawaal ye he ki aakhir ye farji audio-video aayaa kahaan se, ise banaaya kisne or phir ise media tak pahunchaaya kisne?giraftaar main police kar rahi derical tak jo dilli police deshadroh ke aarope se ghire chaatro kii giraftaar ke liye jarra-jarra chaan rahi thi
 Despite five of them coming to JNU on Sunday night and openly giving proof of their presence, the police are now seen to be committing arrests

 ye chaatr hai- umr khalid, anirban, ashutosh, anant or rama naga
 After these five returned to the campus, the police sent an ACP to meet the VC, but no solution was found on the arrest of the accused
 vahiin aaropee chaatro ne kaha he ki vojeenuprushasan kaa koi bhi faisla maanane ke liye taiyaar hai

 Hello, Ravish Kumar
 dilli main sarkaar banane ko lekar chal rahi atakalbaziyaan ab charchaaon ke gambhir daur main pravesh karne lagi hai
 The government cannot be formed in the patriarchy, but there is no restriction on making a statement
 aaj shila dikshit ne kah diya ki demokrasi main jo elected sarkarein hoti hai wo hi sabase acchhee hoti hai
 If the BJP has reached this position that it can form a government then it is a good thing
 eligations kharid farokht ke hameshaa hi lagate hai
 If he makes it, he will have to prove his majority on the floor of the house
 to kharid farokht par to or kuch nahin to yahi kah do
 It is another matter that the Congress has distanced itself from this opinion
 kerala ke rajyapal pad se istipha dene ke baad congress ne shila dikshit ko jawahar laal nehru kii 125 veen janmashati manaane kii cameti kaa adhyaksh banaaya he
 On how the government will be formed, Sheela Dixit says that if mlas will come from any other party, but as of now i have been able to know that the MLA whether it is from Congress, BJP or AAP, no one wants elections so soon
 Huh
 ye sochna ki keval kharid ke ho janaa, ye sahi he yaa nahin he, ye kahana mushkil he
 i think, as far as i know people who are telling me how the government will be formed, now those challenges will be with the Minority Government
 ab usko ye paar kar sakenge yaa nahin wo jane
 On the other hand, an interview of BJP National President Amit Shah has been featured in today's Economic Times
 kaaphi lanbaa he, lekin maine sirf usee hisse kaa yahaan chayan kiya he jiskaa sambandh dilli main sarkaar banane yaa chunaav se he
 In this connection, Economic Times correspondent Rohini Singh asks that sawaal− kya bijepi dilli main tazaa chunava chaahati he yaa apane dam par sarkaar banane kaa prayaas karegi
 Amit Shah does not want any election in Delhi
 pichley ek dedh saal main do-do nattejey aae hai
 Both these mandates have come in favor of BJP
 vidhansabha main ham sabase badi party ke rup main ubhare or loksabhaa main saaton siton par vijayi hue
 The decision of the people is clearly in our favor
 rajya ke str par samasya bahumat kii he
 i do not know who will or will not support the BJP, but if someone wants to support the BJP and that is not an immoral way, then why should we refuse to support it
 sawaal− to bijepi dilli main chunaav ko lekar udasin kyon he Amit Shah- It is not a question of apathy
 ham maanate hai ki dobaaraa chunaav karaane kii koi zarurat nahin he kyonki kam samay ke bheetar party ko do-do janadesh mili hai
 On 12 December 2013, Dr
 Harsh Vardhan wrote a letter to the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi in a paragraph stating that after the Legislative Assembly elections, the BJP wanted to bring a smile in the face of the people of Delhi by getting a clear mandate
 aisa nahin hua kyonki bahumat praapt hone main maatr chaar siten kam rah gayi
 Then after a paragraph of this, we write that the wise people of Delhi have given us the mandate to govern, but in the absence of absolute majority, my party and my party follow the high tradition of political ideals and sit in opposition on the basis of morality
 Would like it
 jo naitik or paardarshee tarika pichley saal nahin tha, kya ab uskaa intazaam ho gaya he
 Does the ethical way mean that the mlas do not want the election to resign or that they should not appear at the time of voting by pretending to have a common cold
 udhar aam aadmi party ne pradesh bijepi ke upaadhyaksh or apane vidhayak kii baatcheet kaa kathith sting kar kharid farokht kaa aarope lagaaya to tivi channelon se lekar akhabaaron tak main kai patrakaron or jaankaron ne likhaa ki aam aadmi party ne bijepi ko peeche dhakel diya he
 Is Amit Shah's statement not telling the BJP to move forward that what happened is a very minor incident
 sting ke sandarbh main iconomik times kii rohini singh bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh se puuchhati hai ki Question- What is your reaction to the sting operation done by the Aam Aadmi Party
 amit shah− mere paas sabhi detail nahin he
 Our state unit is investigating this
 lekin is tarah kii badi party main agar koi nichle str kaa varkar utsaah main kuch kar baithta he tab ise puri party kii chhavi se nahin joda janaa chahie
 Question- But he is the vice president of your state branch
 amit shah− thik he
 But Delhi is like a corporation in a way
 nagarpalika jaisi
 It is a small state, so if a worker is doing something in extreme enthusiasm, he should not be associated with the party
 kya vaaki dilli karporation jaisi he
 Does any worker, according to the size of the state, have an exemption to get involved in the alleged purchase of an MLA by overheating
 pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par 29 sitambar 2013 ko rohinee main narendra modi ne kaha tha ki puure hindustan main jo sabase sukhi mukhyamantri he wo aapke pradesh kii mukhyamantri he
 Happiest
 subah shaam unako riban kaatane ke sivaa koi kaam nahin hota he
 Neither do they have to see the Agriculture Department
 naa unako animal hasbendry departmentt hota he
 Neither do they worry about irrigation
 naa unako machuaaron kaa kaam hota he
 And if there are any pits on the way in Delhi, then only a statement has to be made that it is the responsibility of the corporation
 lau and order problem hota he to itnaa hi kahana hota he ki ye dilli police to centre sarkaar ke paas he
 They have no obligation
 dilli kii karporation jaisi or aisi sarkaar jiske mukhiya kaa kaam feeta kaatane ke alaava kuch nahin nahin hota uske liye bhi naitikta kaa paimaana bhi chota-motaa rahanaa chahie
 But why did it take the BJP nine months that it has the mandate
 ek nahin do do

 cbi's scandal over ub's offices On the other hand, CBI on Monday searched the offices of Vijay Mallya's company United Braberies Group (UB)
 sibiai ke ek adhikari ne yah jaankaree di

 However, the officer refused to give a reason for the search warrant
 lekin jaankaar sutron ne sanket diya he ki maalya or uske samooh kii companiyon kii epaiare ulanghan ke maamle main talaashi lee gai he
 At the same time, the group company said that its officials collaborated with the CBI team
