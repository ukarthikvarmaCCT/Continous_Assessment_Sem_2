 The Kejriwal government has started clamping down on those Dal traders in Delhi who are illegally stocking pulses in their godowns
 khaadya vibhaag ne guuruuvaar ko dilli ke alag-alag ilaakon main kai daal vyapaariyon ke godaamon main red daalkar hajaaron quintal daal jabt kii
 The Food Department has prepared 11 special teams to keep an eye on the traders who hoard the pulses
 har team ke liye leader ke taur par esadm ko niyukt kiya gaya he
 In this campaign, besides the officials of the food department, the inspector associated with the department has been given the responsibility of raiding
 vyapaariyon ke godaamon par chhapakhaadya vibhaag kii special team ne milakar guuruuvaar ko dilli ke alipur, bavana, sirsapur, laurence road, narela or nayaa bazaar ke godaam main chhapemari kii
 On the one hand the traders were unaware of the raid, on the other hand the special team investigated 26 dal godowns throughout the day
 is dauraan alipur or laurence road ke godaam se lagbhag 6776
 60 quintals of pulses seized
 aapako bataa den ki dilli sarkaar ne vyapaariyon ke liye daal kii stock seemaa 2 hajaar quintal tay kii he
 It is illegal since the time of Sheila government to store more pulses than the prescribed limit
 stock badhaane kii mangadal vyapaariyon kaa maananaa he ki pichley kuch saalon main dilli kii aabaadi badhane ke saath hi daal kii khapat bhi badi he
 Dal traders have been demanding the Delhi government to increase the stock limit of pulses from 2 thousand quintals to 5000 quintals for a long time
 dilli ek aisa rajya he, jahaan daal kaa utpaadan bilkul nahin hota he
 Different varieties of pulses are imported from states like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh in the country's capital
 haalanki desh main kai aise rajya he jahaan daal par stock seemaa nahin hoti he
 While there are some states where stock limit is applicable on the most used pulses
 kejariwal ke saamne rakhin 3 maangempichley dinon ek jansabha ke dauraan daal kaarobaariyon ne mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke saamne 3 mukhya maangen rakhi thi- 1
 Raids on traders were stopped
 2
 Strong arrangements should be made for storage
 shahar or gramin kshetra main godaam niyamit kiye jaaen
 3
 daal kii stock seemaa 2000 quintal se badhaakar 5000 quintal tak kii jaae
 The government is worried about the price rise, because the government is also confused that raising the stock limit may not lead to a rise in the prices of pulses
 jaahir he aise main daal ke daam badhane kaa thikra sarkaar par hi phutegaa
 Perhaps this is the big reason why the Kejriwal government has not been able to take any decision on raising the stock limit
 haalanki sarkaar ko ab bhi daal ke daam badhane kii chintaa he isliye khaadya vibhaag kii special team, daal godaamon main chhapemari kaa silsilaa chaalu rakhegi
 Politics in the country has become hot with the picture of Mohammad Ali Jinnah in Aligarh Muslim University
 is mudde par desh kaa sabase bada news channel ajtak 'jinna ek villen par jang kyon' par panchayat yojit kar rahaa he
 In this five-hour-long panchayat, celebrities related to this subject will discuss all aspects of it
 shaam 4 se 5 baje tak chalane vaale satr kaa naam hogaamere angane main tumhaara kya kaam
 It is being operated by Nishant Chaturvedi
 pehle satr main rohit chahal (neshnal media in charge bijewaiem), shahala raashid (purv chaatr sangh upaadhyaksh jeenyu), saurabh choudhary (chaatr netaa eemyu), najamus shaakib (cabinet member eemyu chaatr sangh), kanwalpreet cor (isa adhyaksh, dilli vishvavidhyalay) qurbaan ali (varisht patrkaar or aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay old boij association ke sadsy), firoz bakht ahamed (shikshavid) maujuud hai
 In the first session, Irshad Ahmed, president of Aligarh University Old Boys Association, said that no one has any love for Jinnah's picture
 ye to failaayaa ja rahaa he
 This picture was taken in 1938
 tasviir ko hataane kaa koi to kanoon hoga
 If people from different countries say it, then remove it, but the young corps is opposing the picture
 rohit chahalane kaha ki jinna kii tasviir ke aligarh lahore nahin ban jaataa, lekin ye lagi hi kyon he?shahala raashidane kaha ki marpet puri tarah galat he kyonki hindu mahasabha ne muslim lig ke saath milakar bengal main sarkaar banaai thi
 This RSS mentality also supports the theory of Two Nation
 jinna bhi tu nesan par yakeen karte the
 This dispute is being raised to divert attention from the Kathua incident
 agar jinna kii tasviir se dikkat he to saavarkar kii tasviir kyon nahin hataate?saurabh choudharine kaha ki hamaare kaaryakartaaon ne nahin balki eemyu ke chaatr netaaon ne marpet kii thi
 The MP has written a letter just to remove the picture
 unhen ye adhikaar he
 In the debate, Kanwalpreet Kaur said that if you have problems with Jinnah then why not remove the photo of Savarkar in Parliament? Of course you remove Jinnah's picture, but why have Savarkar's picture kept
 saket bahugunane kaha ki eemyu main sammanit jagah par jinna kii photo hataa deni chahie
 Morarji Desai's nishan-e-pakistan award should also be returned to his family
 jo vyakti bantwaare ke liye jimmedaar he, us vyakti kii photo sammanit sthaan par lagaana bilkul sahan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 AMU student leader Mateen Ashrafne said that if we had love for Jinnah, then every department of AMU would have a picture of Jinnah
 jinna itihaas kaa hissaa hai or itihaas acha ho yaa bura, nahin badal saktaa
 Jinnah divided the countries, divided the hearts, he believes, but why is there a ruckus to remove the picture from just one place
 aap tasviir hataane ke liye kanoon lie
 The people of BJP no longer have any issues left
 isiilie ye ab jinna kii tasviir kaa sahaara le rahe hai
 We are not supporters of Jinnah
 abul kalam aaazaad ke parpotefiroz bakhtne kaha ki hamaare adarsh jinna nahin ho sakate

 The tax cuts that industry and the auto sector are seeking to bail out the economy are not possible from the Finance Ministry
 yah kaam jiesti council karegi
 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said this in Kolkata today
 nirmala sitaraman ne kaha ki jahaan tak jiesti kaa sawaal he, is par jiesti ko vichaar karnaa he, jawaab dena he yaa faisalaa karnaa he
 After a meeting with the tax authorities in Kolkata, the Finance Minister made it clear that the GST Council has to decide on the cut in taxes
 buudhvaar ko sadak parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ne kaha tha ki ve vitt mantri se anurodh karenge ki automobile sector main kuch samay ke liye jiesti kam kar den
 However, the finance minister also has no idea how long the economy will improve
 nirmala sitaraman ne kaha ki 'main is bare main anumaan nahin lagane ja rahi
 We are trying our best to meet the challenges of every sector
 'press conference main vitt mantri ko kai mushkil sawaal jhelane pade
 The Finance Minister said, 'we have taken many initiatives for the auto industry
 lekin arabiai se aae paise kaa kya karnaa he, ye tay nahin hua he
 Even on the decline of the stock market, she avoided saying anything
 udhar shuukravaar ko vitt mantralay ke adhikariyon ne sabhi bade sarkari parikramon ke adhikariyon ko bulaakar unase nae projecton ke liye nivesh badhaane kaa nirdesh diya
 ONGC Director Naveen Chand Pandey said, 'we have decided to invest 87000 crores new in 27 projects
 ye agle teen se chaar saal main nivesh kiya jayega
 'the difficulty is that the initiatives taken by the government in the past to handle the economy have not shown any tangible benefit so far
 sarkaar ke liye sabase badi chunauti vikaas dar ko sudhaarney kii he
 In Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan Rangers opened fire on Indian posts in the RS Pura sector bordering the international border

 apane dost or indian premier lig ke daagdar purv kamishnar lalit modi ko videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj kii madad surkhiyon main uchhali hi thi ki unhone phone uthaaya or suraksha maamalon kii cabinet kamity main apane bharosemand saathi tathaa mitra grih mantri rajnath singh se baat kii
 Rajnath promised that he would communicate the rescue of Lalit Modi "on humanitarian grounds" to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who fled the country in 2010
 pravartan nideshaalay (idi) ne 425 karod rupye ke ghotaale main unki bhoomika ko lekar unase poochtacha kerani chaahi thi
 The meeting with the Prime Minister had already been finalized, so Rajnath insisted that the government should support "one of his own"
 iskaa matlab tha ki tivi par lagaataar tej hoti tikhi aalochanaon kaa jawaab dene ke liye niyamit pravaktaaon se kaam nahin chalegaa
 Big guns have to be put in it
 modi ne bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko bulaayaa or kaha ki unki purv rajnatik virdohi kaa saarvajanik taur par bachaav kiya janaa chahie
 Everyone within the BJP knows that there is no special sweetness between Modi and Swaraj, that this relationship between the two became stronger in the pre-election veela when Narendra Modi's selection for the prime ministerial candidate
 But Swaraj openly expressed disagreement
 vah ladaai haarane ke baad swaraj pichley saal chakachaundh se puri tarah dur raheen or parade ke peeche rahakar duniya ke saath rajanyik rishte badhaane ke liye kamartod kaam karti raheen, tab bhi jab pradhanmantri ne apni yatraaon ke sabhi 18 deshon main khub dhoomdhaam ke saath jhande gaade
 But last week Sushma was suddenly engulfed in a storm, which began with a report in the London newspaper, The Sunday Times
 is report main un par aarope lagaaya gaya ki unhone july 2014 main lalit modi ko yatra ke kagajaat dilwane ke liye bhartiya mul ke british saansad kith vaaj or anya british adhikariyon ke saath apane prabhaav kaa istemaal kiya tha
 The report cited several emails which reflected the close proximity and nexus between Vaj, Lalit Modi and Swaraj
 kahani main duusare kirdaar bhi the, jaise sushamaa ke pati swaraj kaushal, jinhone sasex college main apane bhattije ke daakhile ke liye lalit modi se kaha or unhone badale main vaaj se kaha
 It was learned that Kaushal, a lawyer, had been an advisor to Lalit Modi for 22 years and his daughter Flute was part of the legal team defending him
 sushamaa swaraj nishchit taur par apane paariwarik dost par meharbaani karnaa chaahati thim
 But it is yet to be decided whether they deliberately broke the rules in favor of the man, who is an economic criminal in the eyes of many, or she wanted to help a needy man
 swaraj ke ek najdiki sutara kehete hai, “ve maanati thim ki ve ek dost kii madad kar rahi hai, jisaki bivi biimaar thi
 He never asked the British Government not to send him back to India
 itnaa hi nahin, unka faisla 27 july, 2014 ko tab sahi sabit ho gaya, jab dilli hycourt ne lalit modi par lage yatra pratibandhon ko khaarij kar diya or aadesh diya ki unka passport lautaa diya jaae, jo 2011 main bharat sarkaar ne jabt kar liya tha
 “the fact is that the passport section of the Ministry of External Affairs did not appeal to the Supreme Court in this matter
 haalanki videsh mantralay ke bachaav main yah daleel di ja sakati he ki idi ko aisi salaah deni chahie thi
 Apparently, the two ministries did not talk to each other
 to, kya sushamaa swaraj mahaj ek prakriyaagat kadachaar kii doshi hai yaa baat isse zyada gambhir he? may 2014 main satta ganvaane se pehle lagaataar chaar saal tak upie sarkaar ne lalit modi ke khilaaf idi ke aaropon par kadam kyon nahin uthaae? yahi nahin, vitt mantri arun jetali ne pichley saal is mantralay kaa kaam sanbhaalane ke baad maamle par jor kyon nahin diya, khaskar tab jab kaale dhan ke khilaaf ladaai narendra modi sarkaar ke agenda main sabase upar he?or bhi kai ahm sawaal hai
 For example, in July 2014, what Swaraj told the Prime Minister that she was going to ask London to do a favor in favor of Lalit Modi, especially when she knew that the former IPL Commissioner as the head of the Gujarat Cricket Association But did you know Narendra Modi? Where do he and Vasundhara Raje stand in the future plans of the BJP or at least in the realm of power of Narendra Modi, as Lalit Modi has claimed that the Chief Minister of Rajasthan signed documents supporting his residency status in Britain ? There is no doubt that the country's favorite political check-up game is being played with full fervor these days
 jaipur main kisse faile hue hai ki 2003-2008 tak raaje ke pehle mukhyamantritv kaal main purv ipiel pramukh kis tarah “samvidhanetar satta” ban gaye the
 There is also a discussion that Modi had given unsecured loans to Raje's son Dushyant Singh at that time
 lekin 2013 ke chunaav hote-hote lagata he, modi najaron se utar gaye or yahaan tak twit karne lage ki arun jetali, raaje or bhupendra yadav (jo jetali ke sahaayak or tab gujarat siem narendra modi or aresas ke bich mukhya sandeshvahak the) vidhansabha ke tikat bechney main shaamil the
 Many inside BJP leaders believe that the Lalit Modi controversy has caused a significant damage to the government
 agar lalit modi ke dastavejon par raaje ke dastakhat sachmuch paae jate hai, to party ko baari keemat chukaani pad sakati he; aisi haalat main raaje ko bachaane kaa matlab hoga pradhanmantri ke saamne aaj kii banisbat or bhi puri tarah natmastak ho janaa
 It is also being said that despite Indresh Kumar's statement that the Swaraj was almost exonerated, the RSS is not happy that the old cracks within the BJP are being exposed
 rajnatik pratidwandvi swaraj or jetali ke bich kii duuri ek baar phir saamne aa gai
 The External Affairs Minister refused to even talk to the Finance Minister for advice on how to handle the dispute, even though the ED comes under the Ministry of Finance
 shuruyaat main pradhanmantri ke saamne apni sthiti spasht karne ke liye rajnath singh kaa sahaara lete hue dekhakar bijepi ke andruni sutara hairaani jaahir karte hai ki kya narendra modi ke saath swaraj kii manmutav ab pukhta ho chukaa he
 Jaitley, who seems to have benefited the most from the current crisis, knows that as the dispute intensifies, he must keep his head bowed
 lekin aisa maanane vaale bhi kai log hai ki yah rajnath singh hi hai, jo is puure vivaad kii badaulat arun jetali ko dhakiyakar narendra modi ke baad desh ke duusare prabhaavshaalee shaks banakar ubharne ke raste par hai
 The humble and quiet Thakur leader of Uttar Pradesh was seen smiling softly when Jaitley faced a lot of questions, including his alleged rivalry with Swaraj, at a June 16 press conference
 dilachasp baat yah bhi he ki swaraj ne khud apane hi mantralay ke protocol kaa bhi ulanghan kiya, jisaki tasdik kisi or ne nahin, july 2014 main videsh sachiv rahi sujatha singh ne kii he
 Sujatha Singh told India Today, "he never spoke to me about travel documents for Modi
 ”lekin lagata he, janata kii adaalat main swaraj ko is baat ke liye bhi doshi tehraaya ja rahaa he ki unhone ek aise shaks kii madad kii, jo puri besharmi ke saath aaleeshaan jindagi basar karata he
 Lalit Modi is seen getting up and sitting with the rich and partying with the beautiful people, and this was evident even when he was not allowed to go out of London
 isiilie swaraj kii badaulat apane british yatra kagajaat haath main aate hi 1 agast, 2014 ko unhone anya logon ke alaava ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar, zee ke chairman subhash chandra or antarrashtriya celibrity naomi campbell ko email bhejkar saath dene ke liye shukriya kaha
 At present, Prime Minister Modi and RSS appear to stand united behind the foreign minister; Both agree that they cannot be removed at this time, as it will be seen as a confession and weakness
 lekin yah bhi utana hi sach he ki is saare ho-halle ne swaraj kii mehnat or saavdhaanee se banaai gai pratishtha ko or saath hi unki rajnatik mahatvakankshaon ko khaasi chot pahunchaai he
 a BJP leader close to the RSS said, "if Sushma lives, the alleged benami transactions in Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari's Purti Group may come under attack from the opposition
" is sarkaar se kuch alag hone kii ummid thi
 "but the truth is that the UPA and now the BJP too have failed to impress Lalit Modi or bring him back to India
 jis shaks ne kabhi bharat main khel ke niyam badal daale the, vah nirvaasan main rahete hue logon kii or yahaan tak ki sarkaron kii takadiren badal saktaa he
 BJP insiders are wondering with a little nervousness whether the good, or bad, news will come in the trio? And after Sushma Swaraj and Vasundhara Raje, who will be the next turn among the dusty? haryana main bijepi kii pehali sarkaar ne apane 100 din puure kar liye hai
 Today Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar held a press conference to count his achievements
 media ko bataaya ki pradesh ke vikaas ke liye rodmap taiyaar kiya gaya he or kai nai pahal kii gai hai
 He said that CM window has been started to address public grievances and the scheme has got a good start
 pichhali sarkaar ke bhartee ghotaalon se sabak lete hue bijepi sarkaar ne police bhartee main likhit pariksha ko zyada ank or intervyuu ko nunatam ank dene kii vyavastha lagu kii he
 The Chief Minister also referred to the new sports policy to make the state a sports hub and increase the prize money of the players who won medals at the international level
 karmchaariyon kii sevanivruti umr 60 se 58 karne par naaraazgi jhel rahi rajya sarkaar ne padonniti main essi kota lagu karne ke faisle par haal hi main muhar lagaai he
 The Chief Minister described it as a major achievement, but if we look at the functioning of the government, then it was also discussed on many issues
 shuruyaat hisar main rampal ashram par karrwai se hui
 Police beating of media persons kept the government upset
 aarope lage ki sarkaar ne maamle kii gambhirtha ko samajhane main der kii
 The government was also accused of saffronising the state
 shiksha mantri ne aresas vichaardhaara se jude deenanath batra kii aguwai main nai shiksha niti banane kaa elaan kiya tha, haalanki abhi tak maamla thande baste main hi he
 The Chief Minister himself has also said to implement the system of teaching Gita in schools from the new session
 yoga guru ramdev ko pradesh kaa brands ambesder banane or yoga ko paathyakram main shaamil karne kaa elaan sarkaar kar chuki he
 The government also had to face problems regarding urea
 kai zilon main kisaanon ko laathia khaani padi or dharne par baithna padaa
 Later, the government had to get the slip of farmers in police stations
 apane chunavi ghoshnaa patr main bijepi ne berojgaare bhatta dene kaa vaada kiya tha, khatter sarkaar abhi tak is par khamosh he
 The promise of running security guard buses for school-college going girls has not been fulfilled even though the government has approached the Supreme Court to bring water in the sutlej-yamuna Link canal
 media se duuri banaae rakhane kii policy ke chalate mukhyamantri khatter se zyada unki cabinet ke sahyogi, lekin siyaasi pratidwandi ram bilas sharma, anil vij or captain abhimanyu khabaron main zyada rahe, haalanki mukhyamantri ke kareebi ab ye duuri kam karne kii koshish main jute gaye hai
 However, the biggest achievement of the government so far has been that it has not been accused of corruption in the last 100 days

 ' The Crime Branch of Delhi Police has arrested a father-son duo for cheating on the pretext of selling a metal in the name of NASA, the National Aeronautics Space Administration
 donon peedit se bilkul nasa ke scientist kii tarah mili or unhone us vakt estronotlaute bhi pahana hua tha
 The comments police ne donon kii giraftaar kar liya he
 These astronaut shooters are neither associated with NASA nor any scientists, but by wearing this shoot, they lured a Delhi garment exporter to sell a metal called Rice Puller
 kaarobaari ko bataaya ki arapy metal chaaval ko apneaap apni taraf khinchataa he or ye metal nasa main37500karod kaa bik jayega
 According to the police, both of them spent Rs one crore 43 lakh in the name of investigating the RP metal from the businessman
 kaarobaari ko bataaya gaya ki us paise se estronaut shoot or jaanch se judaa saamaan liya gaya he jo bahut mahangaa he
 While the shoots were taken from Chandni Chowk for just Rs
 1200
 inhoneye bhi bataaya ki jaanch ke liye diardio se ek vaigyanik bulaayaa gaya jisaki fees bahut zyada he
 a fake lab was also shown to the businessman, but later it was said that due to not clear sky, the radioactive RP puller could not be tested and it could not be sold in NASA until the investigation found it to be correct
 
 asal main aaropee pita 56 saal kaa virendra mohan or 30 saal kaa uskaa betaa nitin he
 Both hail from Paschim Vihar in Delhi and were running a motor workshop since 1990
 unhone zyada paise kamaane ke chakkar main khud ko america kii ek metal company kaa maalik bataakarathgi kaa ye nayab tarika apana liya
 Now the police is also looking for his fellow fake scientist
 krime branch ke disipi bhishma singh ke mutabik na to arapy pular naam kaa koi metal hota he or na nasa main iskaa prayog hota he
 The police have arrested both
 estronaut shoot pahanane vaale yah log na to nasa se jude hai or na hi koi vaigyanik hai, lekin isi shoot ko pahanakar in logon ne dilli ke ek garment exporter ko rice pular naam kaa ek metal bechney kaa jhansa diya
 The businessman told that RP Metal pulls rice on its own and this metal will be sold for Rs 37500 crore in NASA
 police ke mutabik in donon ne kaarobaari se arapy metal kii jaanch ke naam par ek karod 43 lakh rupee kharch karwaae
 The businessman was told that the money taken from the Astronaut shoot and investigation was very expensive from that money
 jabaki ke shoot mahaz1200rupee main chandani chowk se liye gaye the
 He also told that a scientist was called from DRDO for investigation, whose fees are very high
 kaarobaari ko ek farzi lab bhi dikhaai gai, lekin baad main ye kaha gaya ki aasmaan saaf nahin hone kii vajah se radioective arapy pular kii jaanch nahin ho saki or jab tak jaanch main ye sahi nahin payajata jab tak nasa main ise nahin bechaa ja saktaa
 In fact, the accused father is 56-year-old Virender Mohan and his 30-year-old son Nitin
 donon dilli ke pashchim vihaar ke rahane vaale hai or1990se ek motor workshop chalaa rahe the
 In order to earn more money, he adopted this unique method of cheating by claiming that he owns a metal company of America
 ab police inke saathi nakli vaigyanik kii bhi talash kar rahi he
 According to Bhishma Singh, DCP of Crime Branch, there is neither a metal named RP Puller nor it is used in NASA
 asal main aaropee pita 56 saal kaa virendra mohan or 30 saal kaa uskaa betaa nitin he
 Both hail from Paschim Vihar in Delhi and were running a motor workshop since 1990
 unhone zyada paise kamaane ke chakkar main khud ko america kii ek metal company kaa maalik bataakarathgi kaa ye nayab tarika apana liya
 Now the police is also looking for his fellow fake scientist

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced not to utter a single word against the Shiv Sena
 sangli kii raily main modi ne kaha ki yah bal thakare ko unki shradhanjali he
 Along with this, he attacked NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, saying that his character does not have the qualities of Shivaji
 narendra modi ne kaha ki maharashtra kii sarkaar ne pradesh kii haalat ekadam kharaab kar di he
 Referring to the scams, he said that even widows' flats were looted in Maharashtra
 sharad pavaar dwaara kii ja rahi aalochanaon ke jawaab main palatwaar karte hue narendra modi ne kaha, 'unhen shaayad itihaas kaa bhi gyaan nahin he
 Gujarat is first running away from Maharashtra
 gujarat aaj bhi maharashtra ko apana bada bhai maanata he
 As expected, Narendra Modi did not say a single word against Shiv Sena, which recently split from the alliance
 unhone saaf-saaf kaha ki ve shivasena ke khilaaf nahin bolenge
 Not only this, he also paid his respects to the late Bal Thackeray
 modi ne kaha, main balasahab kii sankalp shakti kaa aadar karata hum
 This is the first election in Maharashtra in his absence
 'maharashtra se apane khaas lagaav kaa zikr karte hue pradhanmantri ne kaha ki ve is dharti kaa karj chukaane aae hai
 He said, 'till now BJP could never win Lok Sabha elections from Sangli, but this time we got more than what we asked for from Sangli
 sangli ke matadaataaon kaa shat-shat naman' In full support of Sachin Tendulkar in the criticism of Greg Chappell, former Indian cricketer VVS Laxman said on Tuesday that the dressing room atmosphere was 'worse' during the former Australia player's two-year tenure as national team coach
 sachin tendulkar ke apni jald hi vimochit hone vaali aatmakatha 'plaing it maai ve' main kiye kai khulaason par pratikriya dete hue lakshmana ne kaha ki is mahaan ballebaaj ne apni kitaab main jo likhaa he us par unhen puraa vishwaas he
 Laxman said, "I think 2006 was a very difficult period for Indian cricket
 dressing room kaa maahaul sambhavat: sabase kharaab tha
 i remember in 2006 when i was included in the team for the last ODI in South Africa and then the Test series
 mujhe yaad he ki jab main dakshin africa gaya to yah sambhavat: sabase nakaaratmak dressing room tha jiskaa main hissaa rahaa
 There was a lot of tension in the dressing room and it was unnecessary
 ’’ "there was a gap between senior and junior players," he said
 maine hameshaa mana ki cricket team parivaar kii tarah he
 When you are representing the country, when you are on the field, you cannot work as a person
 aapako ek team, ek ikai ke rup main kaam karnaa hota he
 '' lakshmana ne kaha, ‘‘isse koi fark nahin padataa ki aap senior ho yaa junior
 You always help each other and praise each other
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘greg chapel se pehle jaan rhite or greg chapel ke baad gairi karston ko team kaa maahaul sudhaarney kaa shrey jaataa he jisamen ham hameshaa khule dimag ke saath khel paae or hamane hameshaa acha pradarshan kiya
 It is unfortunate that such an atmosphere was created which was unnecessary
 ’’ Tendulkar has mentioned that Chappell had threatened Laxman that his career would end if he refused to start the innings in a Test match in India
 lakshmana ne is sandarbh main kaha ki tendulkar ko apana najariya swatantra rup se rakhane kaa adhikaar he
 He said, "he has been a pillar of Indian cricket and is really a great ambassador of the game
" jab vah ek kitaab likh rahe hon, apni aatmakatha jisamen vah apane puure jivan ke bare main baat karne vaale hai, bhartiya cricket ke rup main unki yatra, ve vibhinn sthitiyaan jinka unhone saamana kiya, mujhe lagata he ki yah unke liye uchit he ki vah sab kuch khulkar kahen
 There is no point in writing a book without honesty
 ’’ The growing population of the country is a matter of concern
 sanyukt raashtra ke anumaan ke mutabik 2024 tak china or bharat kii aabaadi ek jitani ho jaaegi
 After this, India will also leave China behind in terms of population
 centre sarkaar or rajya sarkarein jahaan jansankhya niyantran ke liye tamaam kaarykram chalaati hai, vahiin goa kii rajyapal mridula sinha kaa is bare main kuch or hi kahana he
 He has expressed concern over having a small family of people
 saath hi unhone jansankhya niyantran ke naare ko bhi badal kar ‘ham do, hamaare do yaa teen’ karne kii vakaalat kii he
 At an event in Hajipur, Bihar, Mridula Sinha said, “the family is becoming very small
 meri chintaa kaa vishay he, jahaan jaati hum ye sunne ko miltaa he ki ‘ham do, hamaara ek’, ye naaraa sunai padataa he
 i said that this slogan should be 'hum do, hamare two or three', take this resolution
 goa kii rajyapal kaa ye bayaan hairaan karne vaala he
 That too at a time when large number of people are facing difficulties due to large population and limited resources of the country
 sanyukt raashtra ke anumaan ke mutabik 2024 takabhartaur china, donon deshon kii aabaadi ek jitani yani 1 arab 44 karod ke aasapaas ho jaaegi
 These two countries alone make up 37 percent of the world's population
 agar maujuuda janm dar or mrityu dar hi chalati raheen to bharat kii aabaadi 2030 tak dedh arab or 2050 tak ek arab 66 karod tak pahunch jaaegi
 At the same time after 2030, China's population will begin to decline
 tamaam shaharon kii tarah desh kii rajdhani dilli main bhi log paise nikaalane or jamaa karne ke liye pareshaan rahe 
 
 
 Fights also took place at many places

 (input-ieenes) On one hand, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi were giving dinner to the opposition parties at 10 Janpath, and proclaimed that to stop Modi, differences between states have to be forgotten and united at the national level
 magar duusari taraf upi ke phulpur or gorakhpur ke upachunaav main sapa-basapa ke gathjod ne bijepi ko patkhni de di, donon siton par congress ladi or zamaanat bhi nahin bachaa pai
 In such a situation, the Congress came back on the issue of opposition unity 
 iske baad apane ranneetikaron or siddharmaiya kii raay maanate hue rahul ne karnataka main jedies ke saath jane ke bajaay akele ladane kaa faisla kiya
 Meanwhile, Rahul said that in the event of Congress becoming the largest party in 2019, he can become PM
 is par kaaphi vivaad bhi hua
 During the Congress President's strategy, the Congress's campaign to connect the opposition was seen as a setback
 sutron ke mutabik aise main rahul ne karnataka chunaav ke nateezon se pehle hi bijepi ko rokane ke liye nai ranneeti par bhi sanghathan mahasachiv ashok gahalot or varisht netaghulam nabi azaadase charchaa kii
 Rahul made it clear that Siddaramaiah would become the chief minister if he got a majority or if 2-4 mlas are short, but if the Congress becomes the largest party, then it should form a government with the JDS if it stays away from the majority figure
 sutron ke mutabik charchaa main ek vipareet sambhaavna bhi saamne ai ki agar bijepi sabase badi party bani or bahumat se thodaa peeche rahi to use rokane ke liye jedies ko siem kii kursi de di jaae
 But Congress strategists had no hope of this situation
 isiilie party aakhri sthiti par khamosh thi, jabaki jedies ko saath lene par andarkhaane hami bhari ja chuki thi
 Soon after Sonia Gandhi's Saharakaarnataka election came out against the Congress's expectations, Azad and Gehlot agreed to give the JDS camp the chief minister's chair as directed by Rahul
 idhar, dilli main rahul ne apane faisle ko majbootee dene ke liye ehtiyathan sonia gandhi kii devegoda se baatcheet ko anjaam dilvaaya, jiske liye ahamed patel ne sakriy bhoomika nibhaai
 Message to Opposition Parties: Through this, Rahul wanted to give this message to the other opposition parties that he is ready to take a backseat in the state even if there is a big party to stop the BJP
 ab team rahul ko lagata he ki kumaraswami siem bane to badhiya, nahin bane to bhavishya main karnataka main unako bijepi ko patkhni dene ke liye gathbandhan kaa behatar saathi mil gaya
 Also, if the BJP does not allow Kumaraswamy to become the CM, the remaining regional parties will be vocal against the BJP
 bhala koun banegaa rahul kaa vikalparahul kii ranneeti sidhi he
 Forgetting past experiences, the opposition came with the Congress against Modi
 congress naak kaa sawaal banane kii bajaay sabakaa khyaal rakhegi
 Actually, Team Rahul feels that taking regional parties in the states to compete with Modi
 vaise bhi agar safalataa mili to har surat main congress hi sabase badi party hogi or sabase badi party kaa piem hua to bhala rahul ke sivaa koun ho saktaa he
 At the same time, Rahul's message to the remaining opposition parties through Karnataka is that the Congress can come on the backseat like 1996 if it is needed to stop the BJP
 is masale par 'ajtak' se baatcheet main congress ke varisht netaa arpyen singh ne kaha ki raajnneeti main sahi vaqt par sahi faisla lenaa hota he or rahul vahi kar rahe hai
 In the past, Rahul and Sonia have said that the parties in the states will have to unite at the national level to deal with the dictatorship of the Modi government and protect democracy, despite mutual differences
 gaja pattee main hamaas ke thikaanon par israeli bambaari main teen log ghayal ho gayi hai, iname se ek kii haalat gambhir bataayi ja rahi he
 The Palestinian Security and Medical Service provided this information several hours after the rocket attack in the Jewish nation
 suraksha sutron ne bataaya ki israel ke hawaii vimaan ne kal raat uttari gaja pattee main hamaas ke do sainya thikaanon par hamalaa kiya, jiske kaaran unka kaaphi nuksaan hua he
 Medical officer of Shifa Hospital in Gaza City said that three people injured in the attack are being treated
 26 saal ke ek vyakti kii haalat najuk bhi he
 There are shrapnel in his head
 israel kii sena ne hamaleki pushti kii he or kaha he ki unhone kuch ghante pehle gaja se kiye gayi rocket hamale ke badale yah hamalaa kiya he
 The army spokesman said that there was no loss or damage in that accident
 ye to saaf he ki israel or islamic charampanthi hamaas ke bich mengaja ke saath 2008 seabhi tak kul teen jang ho chuki hai
 Israel is confident that its ground action on the Gaza Strip will help find a solution to the current crisis
 sawaal ye he ki jo aag pichley 66 saal yaa kahen usase bhi pehle se dadhak rahi he wo jang se kaise shant ho sakati he
 The bloody history of the israel-palestine conflict says that war is not a solution to issues
 8 july se gaja pattee jang kii aag main jal rahaa he
 Ever since Israel launched airstrikes in response to rocket attacks in Hamas
 lekin hakeekat ye he ki ye ilaaka pichley 66 saal se jal rahaa he yani jab se dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad bane maahaul main yahudiyon ke liye ek alag mulk kii maang uth rahi thi
 Jews asserted their authority in the area of west Asia where Judaism was born centuries ago
 yahi wo jameen thi jahaan isaiyat kaa janm hua
 Later the history associated with the rise of Islam was also written here
 yahudiyon ke daawey vaale isi ilaake main madhyakaal main arab philistiniyon kii aabaadi bas chuki thi
 Since 1922, this area was under the occupation of the British rule, yet between the Jews and the Palestinians, there was a civil war over the dominance
 isi maahaul main 30 november 1947 ko sanyukt raashtra ne yahudiyon or arabon ke liye vivaad vaale ilaake main bantwaare kii yojana ko sahmati de di
 
 
 According to the agreement, on 15 May 1948 Britain relinquished control of the area and the world map changed

 Former Haryana minister Gopal Kanda, another accused in the case, is still absconding
 atirikt lok abhiyojak rajeev mohan ne kaha, ‘hamen pataa chalaa he ki jab se kanda faraar hai tab se unki company (emdlaar) ke ricard nasht karne ke prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 So we have to get them as quickly as possible with the help of Aruna
 ’ atirikt mukhya metropalitan magistrate di ke janglaa ne aruna kii hiraasat kii avadhi badhaate hue jaanch agency ko nirdesh diya ki vah use tay samay ke andar hiraasat main rakh kar jaanch puri kare
 Police also said that in January 2011, when Geetika started working as a director in the MDLR group, she was asked to report to the company's managing director (kanda) every evening
 unhone kaha ki geetika ko company ke nideshak ke taur par niyukt kiya gaya tha lekin uski company main koi hissedari nahin thi or uski seva sharto main ek shart yah thi ki har shaam vah company ke prabandh nideshak ko report kare
 Police said the company's records can only be obtained through Aruna as Kanda is absconding
 emdlaar kii purv vimaan paricharika geetika (23) ne apni aatmahatya se purv likhe note main aarope lagaaya tha ki kanda or aruna kii pratadna se tang aakar vah aatmahatya kar rahi he
 Both Kanda and Aruna denied the allegations
 jaanch agency ne kaha ki use emdlaar samooh kii sundel ajukeshan sosayadi ke ricard mil gayi hai
 Geetika was its president and Aruna was the secretary
 use ekege infrobild sosayadi ke ricard bhi mili hai jisamen geetika upaadhyaksh thi
 Aruna was the director in it
 jaanch agency ne kaha ki use register aaf societies se company se sambandhit dastavej lekar aruna se is bare main poochtacha kerani he
 Apart from this, all the material has to be received from Geetika's laptop as well
 adaalat ko yah bhi bataaya gaya ki us email kii sachaai jaanane ke liye videsh mantralay ko bhi likhaa gaya he jo kathith taur par dubai ke adhikariyon ne geetika ke pratyrpan ke bare main bhartiya vaanijya duutavas ko bheja tha
 Aruna's lawyer BS Rana opposed the extension of the detention saying that the police is seeking the custody of his client to reach Kanda

 On August 8, Aruna was arrested by the police after being summoned for questioning

 Prabhash Joshi was as big an editor as he was a cricket lover
 haalanki 'khel sirf khel nahin he' pustak main prabhaash joshi dwaara khel par likhe gaye lekh sankalit hai
 In these articles he wrote about almost all sports, but his writing on cricket and tennis had changed the whole scenario of sports analysis in Hindi
 prabhaash joshi ne apni bhoomika main likhaa tha: is pustak main ve lekh die gaye hai jo maine khel par likhe
 Now the way on politics, editorial or main article on editorial page or when necessary, kept writing on the first page
 usee tarah khel jaise khele jate rahe - pehle pej, aakhri pej or sampadakeey pej par cover karata rahaa
 While doing so, which was saved or whose human aspect had no scope for news, the same paper came in the car
 khel ko mahaj ek manoranjan yaa shaareerik vyaayaam main nahin maanata
 The game creates a human character, but more than that the human character is expressed and manifested in the game
 angrej maan ke kenadian bete greg ruzeski ne america maaikel chang se ek match main ek set jeeta, ek haara or tisare set main chaar-chaar game par the
 Rusewski was serving at thirty-thirty
 game jeetne ke liye do point or chahie the
 Somehow he came on deuce and then on Advantage
 ek point ke baad game uskaa hona tha
 Before serving, Rusewski scored a cross and kissed the ball
 tabhi mujhe laga ki game yah haar jayega
 Rusewski served and hit the net and then fouled Duban
 chang ko mauka mila or vah game or set donon le gaya
 At that time, Rusewski's service was like a circle and his career was becoming
 maine likhaa ki vah kabhi koi grand slem jeet nahin paaegaa
 Did not even win and now does not even play
 us match ke sabase najuk or nirnaayak maukey par ruzeski kaa apane par vishwaas nahin tha isliye usne cross banaaya or gend chumi
 In the most difficult time, who does not believe in himself, nothing will be won
 main cricket, tennis, footbal jaise khel inhen najuk or kathin ghadiyon main khilaadiyon or tiimon ke charitra samajhane ke liye dekhtaa hoon
 Not just to entertain
 khel sachmuch ek anushaasan he jo manushya ko puraa banaata or prakat karata he
 Today, India are facing New Zealand in the semi-finals of the World Cup, so it is natural to miss Prabhash Joshi
 sahitya ajtak par padhie unki pustak 'khel sirf khel nahin he' main cricket par likhaa anshampustak anshah khel sirf khel nahin hakehane ko to kahoonga ki bijli chali gai thi
 But what can you hide from me? The truth is that a minute before the power went off, TV was switched off and got up from the meeting and came to the bathroom
 jahaan jane ke liye naha-dhokar taiyaar hona tha vah kaarykram abhi dhai ghante baad shuru hona tha
 It takes some one hour, including both half an hour to get ready and half an hour of the way
 yani dedh ghante baithkar maje main khel dekh saktaa tha
 But two wickets for just seven runs and one of them, Rahul Dravid, made the game unbearable
 bharat kii kisi-kisi sharmnaak or dam uda dene vaali paraajayein dekhe hai! lekin ab sahan nahin hota
 Turned off the TV and came to his bathroom and closed himself
 bijli gai tab main dadhi banane ke liye brush par sabun laga rahaa tha
 It was the first time that electricity could be relieved, and i decidedly started brushing my beard
 ab jab tak bijli nahin aati mujhe baahar nikalakar baithak main tivi dekhakar dukhi, pareshaan or hataash nahin hona tha
 Whatever was happening on the Green Park in Kanpur, i was shaving the ostrich safe shaved head deep in the sand of the bathroom of my room
 apane se zyada koun jaanata he ki shuturamurg ke ret main sir gadaane se registani andhad thamata nahin
 He is the one who tries to escape from the storm by burying his head
 tej se tej or bhayankar retili aandhi se batch vahi saktaa he jisaki jaden ret ke neeche kii jameen main gahare utari hon
 What will you do? More and more leaves will be blown away
 kuch nai, hari or lacheelee daalon ko jhuma-jhuma kar tod degi
 But the tree that stands at the bottom of the sand and the ground also by connecting the joints in the crevices of the rock layer, is not afraid of the trees
 unase uskaa saamana hota rahata he
 Even the grass escapes but it does not fight through the wind
 use apane par se guzar jane detii he
 Letting the bouncer bend over from above also defeats the storm bowler and hooking the ball slightly to the side, also extinguishes the fire
 yahi he ki dak karne vaala out nahin hota or hook maarane vaala kahin na kahin jhil saktaa he
 The ducker also lowers the morale of the storm bowler and also the hooker hitting the six
 aandhi ko parajeet karne ke yahi do tareeke hai
 The batsman plays by his nature
 vivian richards hook maar dete the
 He was also a great batsman and Sunil Gavaskar used to duck
 He also became great
 sunil gavaskar ne richards se zyada ran, zyada shataken banaai or zyada or lambi paariyaan bhi kheli lekin vivian richards jaisaa bolbalaa unako kabhi nahin rahaa
 But Gavaskar faced the storm bowlers as much as he did, and he did not defeat Richards as much as he did
 aag se aag thodi der dabati he lekin bujhati vah pani se hi he
 But ducking or hooking is in your form, nature and character
 pari shuru karne ke pehle aap jo guard lete hai yani khilne kii apni jagah tay karte hai tabhi tay ho jaataa he ki aap kya karne vaale hai or kya kar sakate hai
 You must have seen that i was busy preparing for the evening program, with my head covered in hot sand
 cricket se jivan or jivan se cricket main aane-jane se thik samajhnaa-boojhna or bolnaa ho saktaa he
 Those who think that cricket is just a game and an extreme sport, they do not know that life is also a game
 use vahiyaat kahen yaa samrajyavaadee shagal kahen usase vah jivan virdohi nahin ho jaataa
 After all, even the most democratic people do not play cricket
 jitna acha kheltaa he utana hi janavaadee hota he kyonki cricket khelnaa or jivan jeena aakhir aapaki banat, swabhaav charitra or vichaar kaa hi udghosh he
 The bat of your hand sometimes becomes a gun, sometimes a pen, sometimes a brush, sometimes a shovel and sometimes a computer keyboard
 jaise bathroom main taiyaar hone main laganaa or shaam ke kaarykram ke bare main sochna kanpur se aati aandhi yaa sir par aati bounsar par meraa dak karnaa hi tha
 Telephone bells rang outside while ducking while i was wearing a shirt
 or bajati rahi kyonki phone uthaane vaali bhenji yaa ladi shaayad so gai hogi or ramsih upar apane kamare main hoga
 Finally came out and picked up the phone
 so you haev van-cabin referty ne baat shuru kii
 Heave Oi
 
 
 mere munh se nikal gaya
 Yes, by, at wickets? Tendulkar and Gandhi Did It
 meri ichha hui ki phone rakh don or tivi khol kar dekhen-shaayad award seremani abhi chal rahi ho
 Then i remembered that i will see if there is electricity
 phone par baat karata rahaa
 Kevin did not call me to tell me about the match
 vah hotel main baitha pradhanmantri ke daftar se phone aane kaa rasta dekh rahaa hoga or vakt kaatane ke liye match dekhtaa rahaa hoga
 Yorkshire's friend Kovin Reifert speaks of Yorkshire's solid batsman and now commentator referee Boycott
 bycott oxford ke queens college main padhakar eme nahin kar paae
 Cricket players do not go to college in England for Rosie
 lekin aap oxford main padhein yaa cambridge main jeenyu main padhein yaa bhagalpur main maatrubhaasha main bolne kaa aapkaa lahaza nahin badla
 So talking to Kevin often seems like talking to Boycott
 donon hi apane jivan main saamaan rup se asthir or munhfat hai or isliye kuch jagahon par bilkul asweekaar or baaki kii jagahon par sahan kiye jate hai
 When i shut down the TV, Boycott was speaking on it
 apane khoti yorkshaire sur or lahaze main kah rahe the ki maine bharat ko kai baar jitate hue haarate or haarate hue jitate dekha he
 Anything can happen
 phir bhi bayasi kaa score koi itnaa bada nahin he ki bharat bana nahin paae
 Then after some time he said that i am surprised that in the nineteen times in world cricket, the teams have failed to score eighty runs to win the fourth innings
 or bharat hi do saal pehle barbedas main bayasi se kam main out hua tha, haalaanki tab bhi lakshya bayasi kaa nahin ek sau bees kaa tha, barbedas kii us paraajay kaa zikr aate hi jaise un sab haaron ke bhoot jaag gaye the jinaki kabre mere bheetar bani hui hai, westeindies ke us daure par us test main jitkar ham siries jeet sakate the, sirf ek sau bees ran banane the
 In our team, apart from Tendulkar, Dravid, Ganguly, there were also very experienced Azhar and Siddha
 tendulkar captain the
 But the whole team piled on the eighty-eighty-two in great pity
 walsh or ambros ko jaise khelnaa hi asambhav tha
 It was the same Test, that innings and the same defeat during which India's most experienced batsman Azhar asked 24-year-old captain Sachin from the pitch to play defensively or take an attacking approach? These were the same Azhars who, since becoming captain in the nineties, had consistently said that what should be taken in India's team should also be known when to play
 main kisi ko kya kahoon? achraj nahin ki ham buree tarah haare
 It is said that Tendulkar went inside the room and locked it from inside and did not come out even after calling lakhs
 boycott ne kaha ki tab ve warbadas main the or camentry kar rahe the
 i had also seen that test by ball and that day i had long wanted the earth to burst and be buried in it
 ek bhartiya hone kii shame us din sahan nahin ho rahi thi
 It is true that cricket is a game and India has played hundreds of tests, and most of them have lost
 lekin jo desh jeet ke itane najadik aakar bhi jeet na paae uski banaavat main kahin na kahin koi buniyadi gadabad he or use dhoundkar dur na kar paanaa usase bhi badi gadabad he
 It is not just in cricket to find yourself in a dark and dark tunnel and not make a way out of it
 aap paayenge ki yah sthiti har jagah he cricket main jo puraa dikhaai-bhar detii he
 Those who say that we do not have the ability to kill and kill the killer instict, they talk somewhere and talk
 pashuvat shikaar vritti bharatiyon main waisi hi he jaisi duusare logon main
 There is no biological deficiency in us
 hamaare maanas main jarur koi andhaa dhabba jo vishdhar sarp ko pakadakar uskaa jaharila daant nikaalte samay hamaari ankhon ke saamne aa jaataa he or ham thithkate hai
 And by taking advantage of that fatal sting, the snake comes out of our fists and stings us
 is andhe dhabbe ko pakadakar apane maanas main kharonch daalane kii koi koshish ham karte nahin
 Where she does, she does not appear to be successful
 boycott ramesh ke out hone or dravid ke aate samay kah rahe the ki is sthiti ke liye sabase upyukt vahi ek ballebaaj hai
 They should not be as talented and great as Sachin but are solid and well-versed players
 sachin jam jaaen to do minute main duniya jeet sakate hai lekin pehali gend par ja bhi sakate hai
 Dravid is a true and patient batsman who decides the distance inch by inch
 boycott kaa bayaan abhi chal hi rahaa tha ki dravid elbeadblu hokar lautne lage
 "don't make tea right now, a lot has to happen" - Boycott was saying that i had got up after turning off the TV
 lekin baad main usee tivi par sachin ko dhuandhaar karte hue bharat ko newjiland se jitate hue dekha
 Sachin Tendulkar, who brought India to victory even in the first Test of Mohali, was unbeaten on one hundred twenty six
 lekin unki vah pari captain kii pari thi jo ek sira thame khadey the or dravid or ganguli aage badhkar bharat kaa pahaad khadaa kar rahe the
 There were two ties like Sachin on Sachin - one to be captain and the other from spinal injury to back muscles
 donon unhen khulkar khilne se roak rahe the
 But in the second innings of Kanpur, Sachin went up to bat to win India and the eighty and twenty target was becoming nine and eleven
 ye vahi sachin tendulkar hai jinke bare maheene-bhar pehle hi kaha ja rahaa tha ki ridh kii haddi unke mahaan karier ko bich main tod rahi he
 Now they will be able to play only by stopping and resting in between
 or aise bandhan ke baad kya khaak vah sab kar paaenge jisaki ummid unase das saal se ho rahi he? lekin lagata he ki ridh kii haddi unki peeth kii mansapeshiyon ko zyada chot na pahunchaa paae isliye sachin ne sanbhalkar khelnaa shuru kiya he
 This has led to his rapturousness and audacity from his batting which has often led to his downfall
 isse bhale hi ve vaise dhuandhaari ballebaaj na ban paaen jaise ki ab tak rahe hai lekin sanyam or anushaasan unhen or bhi zyada bada ballebaaj bana de

200 / - Page Number: 352 shivasena supremeo bal thakare ne ek baar phir aag ugali he
 This time the BCCI is on their target
 pakistan se cricket sambandhon kii bahaali par bal thakare ne shivasena ke mukhpatr saamana main lekh likhaa he
 In which he has said that the cricket board which has sent invitations to Pakistanis in India, the same cricket board should be whipped at the Taj Mahal Hotel and Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus station in Mumbai
 jantalman waalon kaa yah cricket khel ab besharm auki nirdayee logon kaa khel ban gaya he
 If there are so many shameless and ruthless people in this country, how much time will it take for this country to become Pakistan
 bal thakare ne aage likhaa he ki 26 / 11 ke aatanki hamale main kai logon ne jaan gavaai auki kai pulisawalon ne balidaan diya
 Knowing this, the decision taken by the cricket board is like a betrayal from the country
 donon deshon ke bich aazaadee ke baad kai baar cricket kaa khel hua lekin har baar cricket ke maidan main khel kam dharmayuddh zyada hua he
 There have been several bomb blasts from Kashmir to South India
 bal thakare ne kaha ki muslim vot paane ke liye congress yah kar rahi he
 Thackeray wrote that even if we kept flying pigeons with a peaceful message, Pakistan would not desist from firing gunfire
 bam dhamaake kar bharat ke bekasur logon kii jaan lenaa band nahin hoga
 Therefore, peace talks with Pakistan is a hypocrisy and playing cricket is a treason
 bal thakare ne sunil gavaskar kii tarif karte hue kaha he ki gavaskar ne jis tarike se cricket khilne ke faisle kii ninda ki usase ham khush he
 Rajiv Shukla may have described it as Gavaskar's personal view, but according to us Sunil Gavaskar has said what the 100 crore people of this country think
 deshavaasiyon kaa sochna he ki pakistan ke saath cricket nahin yudd hona chahie
 Bal Thackeray has also slammed the Maharashtra government on this issue
 unhone likhaa he ki maharashtra ke mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan ko 26 / 11 ke shahid tukaraam omble kii smarak par khadey hokar yah elaan karnaa chahie ki ve is shahar main pakistaniyon ko ghusane nahin denge
 Any cricket lover who understands this should not go to these matches
 khaali stadium hi pakistan ke prati apana virodh hoga auki 26 / 11 ke shaheedon ke prati shradhanjali
 Rajiv Shukla, Sharad Pawar go all happily to the stadium and watch this match
 dilli ke bharat nagar ilaake main ek siraphire aashiq ne shanivaar ko ladki ke ghar main ghus kar goli maar di
 The girl's name is Anshul and she is a chartered accountant
 vahiin goli maarane vaale shaks kaa naam harish bataaya ja rahaa he
 According to sources, preliminary investigation has revealed that the accused had already known the girl
 harish or anshul donon kareeb 5 saal tak relationships main rah chuke hai
 But recently Anshul has got engaged to someone else

 State's Tribal Welfare Minister Vijay Shah, who has been facing criticism after making objectionable statements in Madhya Pradesh, submitted his resignation to Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, which has been accepted by the Governor
 shivaraj singh chouhan ke kareeb sutron ne bataaya ki vijay shah ne buudhvaar tadake mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko apana istipha saunpa, jise unhone rajyapal ram naresh yadav ko bhej diya
 The governor accepted it
 pradesh ke adivasee bahul jhabua jila mukhyalay main teen din pehle schuli greeshmakaleen shivi main chaatraon ko sambodhit karte hue mantri vijay shah ne mahilaon visheshkar mukhyamantri kii patni sadhana singh ko lekar kathith abhadra dwiarthi tippanee kii thi
 Sources at the Chief Minister's residence said that Minister Shah, along with State BJP President MP Narendra Singh Tomar and Organization General Secretary Arvind Menon, reached Chief Minister's residence and submitted his resignation to Chauhan
 party sutron ke anusaar mantri shah beeti raat lagbhag 12 baje adhyaksh tomars ke nivas par pahunche or vahaan unhone tomars va sanghathan mahaamantri menon ko apane bayaan ko lekar safai di
 He said that after the two-hour consultation between the three, Minister Shah along with Tomar and Menon reached the Chief Minister's residence around 2 pm and presented a clarification in front of Chauhan about his statement, but the Chief Minister immediately asked him for his statement Asked for resignation vijay shah ne bhi aanan-fanan main mukhyamantri nivas main hi apana istipha likhakar mukhyamantri chouhan ko saunp diya
 There was a lot of boil in the political corridors of the state over the controversial statement of Shah for two days
 pradesh mahila congress ne ise lekar mangalvaar ko kai sthanon par shah kaa putala dahan kar unka istipha maanga tha
 What is the whole matter
 
 
 madhya pradesh ke aadim jati or anusuchit jati kalyaan mantri vijay shah ne jhabua ke kaarykram main saikadon chaatraon or teacheron ke saamne 'dabl mining' bhaashan diya tha
 Vijay Shah said during a summer camp in Jhabua on April 13, 'the man does not forget the first thing that happens
 bhuulataa he kya? bachche samaj gaye honge
 Shortly after this, the Minister said in a mischievous tone that by 'first of all matter' he meant for the first time to reach the post of Minister
 baad main apane vivaadaaspad bhaashan ke baad vijay shah ne kaha, ‘agar mere bhaashan se kisi ko thodaa sa bhi dukh hua ho, to main iske liye 10 baar maafee maangata hum
 'he said,' i am saddened that my speech given in the mood of ridicule was taken in a wrong way
 ’vijay shah ne daawa kiya ki unke bhaashan ko media ke ek hisse main ‘tod-marodakar’ pesh kiya gaya
 But when asked what he had actually said during his speech, he said, 'I don't want to get into this affair anymore
 main baat ko aage nahin badhanaa chahta
 'however, after the minister's resignation, the matter is now expected to calm down
 2014 ke aam chunaav main aitihaasik jeet darj karne vaali bhartiya janata party rajyon main bhi chunaav-dar chunaav apni jeet kaa paracham laharaati aa rahi he
 Elections were held in 22 states after Narendra Modi became Prime Minister, out of which BJP and its coalition government are present in 20 states
 bijepi congress mukt bharat ke apane mishan kii taraf bad rahi he, lekin haal ke kuch upachunaav main bijepi kii haar or karnataka main gathbandhan sarkaar banane ke baad bijepi virdohi dalon main bhi ek nai urja kaa sanchaar hua he
 The result of this is that the Congress is engaged in a plan to overcome its electoral excesses with the help of opposition solidarity
 congress ke chunavi shatranj main philhal bahujan samaaj party kii mukhiya mayawati sabase ahm mohara najar aa rahi hai
 The reason for this is the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, before that there are assembly elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh to be held a few months later
 shaayad yahi vajah rahi ki bengalooru main jedies ke echdi kumaraswami ke shapathgrahan samaaroh main jab vipakshi dalon ke netaa jute to upie cheirperson sonia gandhi ne mayawati ko behad shiddat ke saath gale lagaaya
 After that picture of Karnataka, the news is also coming that the Congress can contest elections in these three states (rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh) with the BSP
 darasal, congress kii is ranneeti ke peeche in rajyon main basapa kii nirnaayak maujuudagi he, jisamen congress ko aashaa kii kiran najar aa rahi he
 At present, there is a BJP government in all three states
 madhyapradeshmadhyapradesh ke 2013 vidhansabha chunaav ke aankadon ko dekha jaae to kul 230 siton main se bijepi ko 165 siten mili thim or uskaa vot pratishat 44
 Was 88
 vahiin, congress ko 36
 58 seats were won with 38% vote share
 basapa ko haalanki mahaj 4 siton par jeet mili thi, lekin uskaa vot pratishat 6
 Was 43%
 itnaa hi nahin bispi 11 siton par duusare number par rahi thi
 In all these seats, the BSP candidates gave a tough fight to the BJP
 aise main congress or basapa kaa gathjod hone kii sthiti main bijepi ko nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 BJP has 163 seats out of the total 200 seats in Rajasthan Rajasthan Assembly
 2013 main hue chunaav main bijepi ne 45
 Had secured 2% votes
 jabaki congress 33
 21 seats and 3 with 1%
 4% vot ke saath basapa 3 siten jeet pai thi
 The BSP was runner-up in three seats and contested the BJP
 dilachasp baat ye he ki daliton kii party kahi jane vaali basapa ko teenon jeet saamaanya siton par hi mili thim
 While the BJP won 33 seats out of 34 seats reserved for Scheduled Castes and one seat was won by others
 baavjood iske congress or bispi ke vot milakar bijepi ko kadi chunauti de sakate hai
 Chhattisgarh In the 2013 Chhattisgarh Assembly elections, BJP won 49 seats out of total 90 and the party formed the government on its own
 bijepi ko 41% vot mila tha, jabaki congress ko 40
 With only 3% votes, only 39 seats were found
 basapa ko 4
 1 seat was found with 3%
 aise main agar congress-basapa saath milakar chunaav ladate to bijepi ke liye sarkaar bananaa shaayad mushkil hota
 This is the reason why Congress feels it is important to support Mayawati
 vaise congress in rajyon ke bahaane upi par nishaanaa bhi laga rahi he
 Actually, the situation of Congress in UP is very bad
 jabaki rajasthan, madhyapradesh or chhattisgarh main congress mukhya vipakshi dal kii bhoomika main he
 In such a situation, when the formula of opposition solidarity is ready in the 2019 general elections, then the Congress will try to contest elections by getting maximum seats in UP
 duusari taraf mayawati sammanjanak siten milane par hi gathbandhan ke liye raji hone kaa elaan kar chuki hai
 It is believed that if the Congress opens its heart to the BSP in MP, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan and gives it enough seats, it will be expected to get some seats from Behenji in UP
 upi main mahagathbandhan hone par sapa or basapa ke bich siton kaa bantwaaraa hoga to congress ke liye bahut zyada siten nahin bachengi
 In such a situation, the party is already engaged in winning Mayawati's heart

 The pain of lifting a heavy bag on the face of children going to school in the morning seems different
 abhi tak lagata tha ki in maasoom bacchon kii takalif par kisi kii nazar nahin ja rahi lekin maharashtra sarkaar ne abhibhavakon ko ye sunishchit karne kaa aadesh diya he ki unke bachche kam se kam vazan uthaaen
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has passed a resolution saying that no child in the state will carry a bag weighing 10 percent more than his body weight while going to school
 kaksha 1 main padhane vaale paanch saal ke bacchon ko class main ghuste hi apane baste ko taraazoo par rakhana hota he taaki teacher check kar saken ki bag kaa vazan 2
 Not more than 5 kg
 sarkaar ne apane prastaav main kaha he ki 12 saal ke aathvin ke bachche 4
 Do not carry more than 2 kg weight bags so that a long illness can be avoided
 tippaniyan The local education secretary has written in a government order that according to the rule, children's bags should not exceed ten percent of their weight
 lekin hamen pataa chalaa he ki moti moti kitaab-copy, bevajaah kii steshnari or yahaan tak kii cosmatics kii vajah se baste kaa vazan 20 se 30 pratishat ho jaataa he
 This is dangerous
 isse thakaavat,tanaav ke saath saath reed kii haddi or jodon main dard kii samasya bhi ho sakati he
 This affects the health of the child
 gauratlab he ki lagaataar badhate pratispardhaa ke maahaul main bacchon par acchhee padhai karne kaa lagaataar dabaav bana rahata he isliye abhibhavak aksar unke bag main shaam ko lagane vaali tution kaa saamaan bhi rakh diya jaataa he
 The government has said in its order that there should be some changes in homework and timetables so that children do not have to bring a lot of books every day
 saath hi abhibhavak bhi bevajaah ke saamaan se bacchon kaa bag naa bharen
 However, in this order there is no mention of punishment for violating these rules related to weight
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne ek prastaav paarit karte hue kaha he ki rajya kaa koi bhi baccha skool jate vakt apane sharir ke vazan se 10 pratishat zyada ke vazan kaa bag nahin uthayega
 Five-year-olds studying in class 1 have to keep their bags on the scales as soon as they enter the class so that the teacher can check that the weight of the bag is 2
 5 kilo se zyada to nahin he
 The government has stated in its proposal that 4 children of the eighth age of 12 years
 2 kilo se zyada vazani bag nahin uthaaenge taaki kisi lambii beemaari se bachaa ja sake
 The comments sthaneey shiksha sachiv ne shaskeey aadesh main likhaa he ki niyam ke anusaar bacchon kaa bag unke vazan ke das pratishat se zyada nahin hona chahie
 But we have come to know that due to thick book-copy, inexplicable stationery and even cosmetics, the weight of the bag is 20 to 30 percent
 ye khatarnaak he
 This can lead to tiredness, tension as well as pain of the spinal cord and joints
 isse bachche kii sehat par bura asar padataa he
 Significantly, in the constantly increasing competition environment, there is constant pressure on the children to do good studies, so parents are often kept in their bags for the evening tuition
 sarkaar ne apane aadesh main kaha he ki homework or timeteble main kuch badlaav hone chahie taaki bacchon ko har din dher kitaaben naa lani pade
 Also, parents should not fill the children's bags with unnecessary items
 haalanki is aadesh main vazan se jude in niyamon kaa ullaghann karne par milane vaali sazaa kaa koi zikr nahin kiya gaya he
 The local education secretary has written in a government order that according to the rule, children's bags should not exceed ten percent of their weight
 lekin hamen pataa chalaa he ki moti moti kitaab-copy, bevajaah kii steshnari or yahaan tak kii cosmatics kii vajah se baste kaa vazan 20 se 30 pratishat ho jaataa he
 This is dangerous
 isse thakaavat,tanaav ke saath saath reed kii haddi or jodon main dard kii samasya bhi ho sakati he

 Now the draft of this law has been released by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs and opinion has also been sought from the people on this
 2011 kii janaganana ke mutabik, desh main kareeb 1
 1 crore houses are lying vacant and the government wants everyone to take up these houses on rent by 2022, as per their target of home
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki maujuuda kanoon rental houseing ko hatotsahit karte hai
 So the owners do not want to rent their vacant houses for fear of occupation
 awaasan or shahari kaary mantralay kahata he ki kiraayedaar or maalik ke bich paardarshita or uttardaayitv kii bhaavana, donon ke hiton main santulan banaate hue nyaayik daayre main rahete hue, kaayam karne ke makasad se ye kanoon laayaa ja rahaa he
 But the other aspect of it is that the government wants to formalize the transaction between the tenant and the landlord by trapping the leg so that the stamp duty money on the rent can come to the treasury
 abhi metro shaharon ko chhod diya jaae to chote shaharon main rent agreement kaa chalan nahin hua he
 Not only this, a large number of small houses are not signed in metro cities
 rajya sarkaron ne kiraaye par stamp duty bhi alag-alag nirdhaarit kii he
 In Maharashtra, the government has to pay interest on 11 months refundable deposit with quarter percent while in Uttar Pradesh 4 percent stamp duty is levied
 haalanki dilli-noida main rent agreement par 2 fisadi stamp duty he
 However, the new law gives the agreement to both tenants and owners a commercial appearance
 iske prastaavit praavdhaanon ko jaananaa jaruri he
 Under this, there will be a rent authority in every district
 rent athurity kii tainaati jila colector, rajya sarkaar ke aadesh se karenge or rent athurity dipti colector rank kaa afasar banaaya jayega
 Apart from this, there will also be rent courts
 kiraayedaari kii prakriya kuch is tarah hogi- achal sampatti kiraaye par lete hi uski soochna kiraayedaar or maalik donon rent athurity ko denge
 The Rent Authority will give a unique ID number to all the parties as soon as the Rent Agreement is received
 saath hi agreement samet sabhi dastavej digital platform par agreement milane ke saat dinon ke bheetar aplod ho jaaenge
 If the tenure of the agreement expires and the tenancy is not renewed, in such a situation the monthly rent will be applicable at the rate of the old rent but this arrangement will not last more than six months
 makaan maalik-kiraayedaar ke sambandh thik hai to sab thik he
 If there is a dispute, the tenant must vacate the house
 makaan khaali na karne vaale kiraayedaaron ke liye kaaphi sakht praavdhaan rakhe gaye hai
 According to the terms of the agreement, the landlord will be entitled to compensation if the house is not vacated
 ye muaavja pehle do maheene main kiraaye kaa doguna or phir agle maheenon main kiraaye kaa chaar guna ho jayega
 If the advance is taken by the landlord, then he has to return it to the tenant while vacating it
 aisa karne main asamarth rahane par use byaaj samet rakam lautaani hogi
 The landlord will have to give the rental receipt and upon receipt of the payment through electronic mode, the receipt of the bank transaction will be treated as a receipt
 makaan kii tut-foot yaa mentanence kaa jimmaa rent agreement ke mutabik hoga
 If these tenant does not maintain or repair according to the conditions even after giving notice, the landlord can deduct money from the security deposit by making the repairs
 lekin marammat kii rakam security diposit se zyada hone par uskaa bhugtan kiraayedaar ko makaan maalik kaa notice milane ke ek maheene ke bheetar karnaa kanuunan jaruri hoga
 If the owner has the responsibility of repairing and is not getting it done, then the tenant can deduct the amount from the rent by repairing it according to the terms of the agreement
 lekin vah aisa nahin kar saktaa ki marammat kii rakam ke naam par kiraaya hi na de
 He will not have the right to deduct more than 50 percent of the rent
 agar makaan jarjar ho jaae or maalik marammat na karaae to kiraayedaar 15 dinon kaa likhit notice dekar athurity ke aadesh se agreement se pehle hi makaan khaali karke ja saktaa he
 The landlord's tenant also has a condition of entering the house
 vah kisi marammat ke liye 24 ghante pehle likhit yaa electronic sandesh kiraayedaar ko degaa jisamen marammat aadi kii vajah saaf likhi hongi
 The owner will be able to do the repair work from 7 am to 8 pm
 jaahir he ye kuch aise praavdhaan hai jinako abhi tak samhitabaddh nahin kiya gaya tha
 Because of their codification, those who want to keep a clean record will be comfortable
 lekin asli samasya rajdhani dilli main hogi jahaan is kanoon kaa bahut virodh ho rahaa he
 Some tenants have been frozen in shops for years and occupied the prized property by paying nominal rent
 chote shaharon ke puraane ilaakon main bhi aise anek maamle mil jaaenge
 These laws should prove effective for them
 (manish dikshit india today main assistant editor hai)*** Low intensity earthquake tremors were felt in many parts of Himachal Pradesh in the early hours of Thursday
 haalanki abhi tak bukamp se jaan or maal kii koi haani nahin hui he
 The comments mausam vibhaag ke adhikari ne bataaya ki subah 4
 3 on the Richter scale at 12 o'clock
 3 tivrata kaa bukamp darj kiya gaya
 The epicenter of the earthquake was Kullu region
 himachal se sate mandi jile main bhi bukamp ke jatke mahasoos kiye gaye
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Meteorological Department official said that 4 in the morning
 12 baje richter paimaane par 3
 An earthquake of 3 magnitude was recorded
 bukamp kaa centre kullu kshetra rahaa
 Earthquake tremors were also felt in Himachal's adjoining Mandi district
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Authorities had earlier described it as an accidental death
 lekin varsh 2013 main post mortem ke baad ise hatya qaraar diya gaya
 Rudd has also been an attorney and a school board member
 varsh 2015 main un par hatya kaa aarope lagaaya gaya tha
 The prosecutor stated that Rudd committed the murder so that he could receive US $ 100,000 of insurance money
 unke abhiyojak ne kaha ki mahila kii maut ek ‘dukhad durghatana’ thi or maamle main thos sakshya kii kami he
 Virat Kohli's IPL team Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) uploaded a video on youtube on Tuesday, which has been viewed more than one lakh times so far
 is video main dikhaaya gaya he ki viraat kii shooting ke dauraan ek anjaan vyakti ghus aayaa or sidhe viraat ke paas pahunch gaya
 This man told Virat that the two of them have never met before, because 'two superstars cannot live in the same room
 
 
 ' yahi nahin, iske baad is vyakti ne kohli ko dialog bolnaa sikhaanaa shuru kiya
 When the director felt that Virat Kohli was losing his temper, he showed the person the way out
 kya viraat or is 'ghuspaithiye' kii yah mulaakaat pehle se yojana banaakar karwaai gai thi, or kya yah 'ghuspaithiya' aaarasibi kaa hi koi sikhaaya-padhaayaa shaks tha, yah aap video dekhakar khud tay karen
 
 
 The thing to remember is that all of us have seen Kohli's anger erupt many times before
 varsh 2013 main ipel ke hi dauraan gautam gambhir se unki bahes kaaphi surkhiyon main rahi thi
 Recently, Virat Kohli abused a journalist who talked to him about his girlfriend actress Anushka Sharma
 iske alaava ek baar unhone zimbabwe ke khilaaf khele gaye ek match ke dauraan third ampaire dwaara out die jane par maidan par maujuud adhikariyon ke saath bhi aakraamak tareeke se kaaphi bahes kii thi
 So, this is what we will say - whatever this man was, he showed great courage, friend
 
 
 mahilaon ko apni tarif behad pasand aati he
 Despite this, she often changes the topic instead of accepting the supplement
 offis main isse galat sandesh jaataa he
 You work so hard to balance home and office, so if any good thing is coming to you, then let us come
 yahaan die gaye kuch suzav aapaki isamen madad karenge
 Do not change the topic, no matter how upset or uneasy you get
 is ehsaas ko jaahir na karen
 Just understand that the supplement was your right
 workaplacepar koi complement de to use smil ke saath acept karen
 The praise that comes after hard work is always good
 thankyuu bolnaa na bhuulenaap bhale hi complement ko majaak main uda den, par baatcheet ke ant main unhen thankyuu kahana na bhoolen
 You can also mention your team and their hard work
 kis tarah aapaki team ne aapkaa saath diya
 a return of praise is not a compliment, no one should praise you, it does not mean that you also tie the bridge to its praise in the return
 pehle sunen ki saamne vaala vyakti kya kah rahaa he
 After that some hair
 sidhe-sidhe tarif karne kii bajaay baatcheet ke ant main yah kaha ja saktaa he ki aapane bhi meri bahut help kii
 Body language is right when giving any supplement, do not look at your palms
 kuch ladkiyaan tarif pate hi kapade yaa pen se khilne lagati hai
 This is a sign of your nervousness
 isaki jagah sidhe ankhon main dekhen
 Accept the compliment with a light smile and grace
 beauty treetment se nahin is phespac se lautega chehre kaa nikhaar
 
 
 Honesty is also important, but if you feel that you have not achieved the position for which you should be given a compliment, then very politely say that there is much work to be done
 par yah jaanakar acha laga ki main bilkul sahi trek par hum
 The 5-year-old fell in love, tied up with Tossaif Ali Khan and Karinashadi
 saf or karina ne jamaane ke saamne aakar bataa diya ki haa ham pati-patni ho gaye hai
 But after this marriage, some important questions have also arisen regarding Islam
 shaadi kii sweekaaryata par andeh ke badalsaf or karina pati-patni to ban gaye, lekin ek sawaal ke saath
 The question is Islamically big, because Kareena is married to Saif Ali Khan and this marriage is not being accepted as Islamic
 16 oktober kii dopaher saf or karina ne mumbai main civil marij kii, yani hindustan ke kanoon ke hisaab se wo pati-patni ban gaye
 There were no frills in this marriage
 mumbai main bollywood se bhi chuninda mehmaan hi aae
 Karishma, elder sister of Kareena Kapoor was witness to this marriage
 daarul-ulum ne saf or karina kii shaadi par apana faisla sunaaya he
 
 
 
 to kya karegaa kaaji?ek kahawat sadiyon se chali aa rahi he ki miyaan-bivi raji, to kya karegaa qaazi
 Now why are jumping in it, do not understand
 kanuunan saf or karina ek ho chuke hai, lekin islam ke ulema isapar sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 Darul Uloom of Deoband also did not justify saif-kareena's marriage with religion
 daarul ulum ke mutabik shaadi 'nazaij'duniya bhar main mashhoor islamic sanstha daarul ulum ne is shaadi ko jaays maanane se inkaar kar diya he
 Saif and Kareena's marriage did not pass for even 72 hours that a dispute arose over the marriage
 daarul ulum kii maane, to is shaadi main sabase bada pech yah he ki karina kapur ab bhi karina hi hai
 The controversy in this marriage is that unless the boys and girls enter Islam, Sharia does not allow this marriage
 saf or karina kii shaadi par raay dete hue daarul ulum ke pravaktaa ne kaha ki ve isapar koi fatwa jari nahin karnaa chaahate hai daarul ulum kaa kahana he ki is shaadi ko chhodie, bollywood main zyaadaatar shaadiyaan islam ke mutabik nahin hoti hai
 saif-kareena has registered that it is registered that Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor have registered marriage
 saf ne karina se shaadi ke vakt apana naam sajid ali khan likhvaya he, jo ki unka asli naam he
 Now according to the law, both have become husband and wife, but according to Islam, there are many complications in this marriage
 devband ke daarul ulum kaa yah bhi kahana he ki aisi shaadi main jo bachche paidaa hote hai, wo bhi jaays nahin maane jaaenge
 If they accept Islam, they can then enter Islam
 lekin yahaan ek baar phir vahi kahawat feet baithti he ki miyaan bivi raji to kya karegaa kaazi
