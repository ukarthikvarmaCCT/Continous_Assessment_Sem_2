vahaan ediemke or diemke ke mukaable bijepi ek majboot tisare morche kii neenv rakhane ja rahi he, jabaki andhra pradesh main telugu desham party (tidipi) se uske gathbandhan kii ghoshnaa ab sirf ek aupchaarikta he
 In the last Lok Sabha election, it was because of Andhra Pradesh that the Congress crossed the 200 mark
 wiesar reddy ke rup main mili ek taqatvar netaa ne congress ko yah kamyaabi dilaane main badi bhoomika nibhaai, lekin ab halaat badale hue hai
 After ysr's death, his son Jaganmohan split from the Congress to form his own party
 andhra pradesh kaa vibhaajan ho gaya he
 On June 2, separate Telangana and Seemandhra states will come into existence
 bijepi or telugu desham party (tidipi) ke bich gathbandhan hona kareeb-kareeb tay mana ja rahaa he
 It is being said that during the likely rally of Narendra Modi around 25 March in Seemandhra, an alliance between the two parties can be announced
 11 march ko apni hyderabad yatra ke dauraan party adhyaksh rajnath singh or varisht netaa arun jetali ne rajya ke netaaon ko yah kah bhi diya he ki ve tidipi ke saath gathbandhan ko taiyaar rahen
 Negotiations are on for seat sharing between the leaders of both parties
 tidipi ko ummid he ki telugana or simandhra donon jagahon par bijepi se talmail karne se modi ke naam par bijepi ko mil rahe vot use transfar ho sakenge
 Whereas BJP feels that by taking advantage of tdp's extensive grassroots base and organization, it can achieve electoral success in some big cities of both parts
 aisa hona bijepi ke liye ek badi kamyaabi maani jaaegi
 Not only will the NDA get a strong ally in the form of the TDP, but it will also get a big chance to spread its foot in Andhra Pradesh after Karnataka in South India
 bijepi ne tidipi ke saath gathbandhan main 1999 main loksabhaa kii saat siten jiti thim or vidhansabha main use chaar fisadi vot mili the
 Whereas in the 1998 Lok Sabha elections, BJP won four Lok Sabha seats in alliance with TDP
 dikkat yah he ki bijepi ne jis tarah se sansad main telugana bill kaa samarthan kiya, usase simandhra main uske khilaaf maahaul bana hua he
 TDP realizes this and that is why the alliance has not been announced yet, but tdp's resentment in the middle was to the extent that it also stopped the alliance's talks
 koshish yah kii ja rahi he ki narendra modi kii simandhra main ek ke baad ek tabadatod reliyaan karai jaaen or inamen ve ye aashwaasan den ki endie kii sarkaar aane ke baad simandhra ke liye vishesh package diya jayega
 BJP is also ready for this
 ramvilas paswan kii hi tarah chandrababu naidu kaa bhi saath aana vyaktigat taur par narendra modi ke liye behad sukun dene vaala hoga
 Like Paswan, Chandrababu did not want to upset his Muslim votes
 donon hi netaa khud ko secular bataate hai or ye tisare morche ke saath rahe hai
 Chandrababu was associated with the BJP in the name of non-congressism
 lekin 2002 ke dangon ke baad bhi bijepi ke saath bane rahe, kyonki party ne alag telugana na banane dene kaa vaada kiya tha
 In the time of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, BJP has had allies like PMK, MDMK, DMK or AIADMK in Tamil Nadu, Ramkrishna Hegde in Karnataka besides TDP from South India
 lekin vaajapeyi or modi kii chhavi kaa antarvirodh saamne laakar modi ke bare main hameshaa yah kaha jaataa rahaa ki bijepi ko sarkaar banane ke liye nae sahyogi nahin mil paaenge
 But Modi has tried to break this myth by first tying up with leaders like Paswan and now Chandrababu Naidu
 jaahir he is ummid main ki inhen dekhte hue chunaav ke baad mamata banerjee, jayalalita yaa naveen patnayak jaise sahyogi saath aane se nahin ghabaraaenge
 Rahul Gandhi has said two things related to education and government jobs
 unhone malda main kaha ki gaanv or kasbon main sarkari kalejon ke network ko durust karenge
 On coming to the second government, by March 2020, the central government will fill 20 lakh vacant posts
 dedh saal se naukari series or uniwarsity series kar rahaa hum
 No political party took these issues seriously
 sabane kinaaraa kiya
 Now that it is coming in every survey that the youth is giving priority to the most unemployed, there is no concrete thing on it
 rahul gandhi ke in do vaadon se lagata he ki ve prime time dekhte hai! bijepi ko bhi dekhnaa chahie
 For the first time in the history of television in the world, i have spent such a long time on education and jobs on prime time television
 ek din nahin, ek haftaa nahin balki kai maheene
 It did 50-60 episodes on the university, went on to prime time for several months on government jobs
 fasebuk pej @ravishkapage par pachaason lekh likhe hai
 Anyone can check
 is itihaas ko koi tivi vaala pehle match kar dikhaa de
 Both statements of Rahul Gandhi should be debated
 tabhi pratispardhaa main baaki dal bhi sarkari shiksha or rojgaar ko mahatv denge
 Will make more concrete promises rahul ke vaade main ek dedline he or ek number he
 Like Modi, there is no pattern of right to left by promising two crore jobs every year
 unase poocha ja saktaa he ki 30 march 2020 khatm ho rahaa he
 How many jobs were given in 20 lakhs
 patrakaron or noujvaan bhi is dedline or number se unka peechha kar sakate hai
 It should also be asked that the condition of the current examination system is poor
 uske bas kii nahin he ki koi pariksha niyat samay par karaae
 Explain in a concrete way how this will work
 rahul ke is elaan ko unki hi party ke netaa badhaava nahin de rahe hai
 Maybe they will be less sure
 chidambaram jaise netaaon ko isamen yakeen he yaa nahin pataa nahin lekin is tarah kii line rahul ko unki hi party ke korporate parast netaaon se bhida degi
 Conflict between two political parties and within every political party should now be on these issues
 gaanv kasbon ke college darak gaye hai
 Congress governments have also been responsible for this
 bijepi or kshetreey dalon kii bhi
 The BJP got a chance to run the government for 15 years in three major states
 aaj tak koi stareey shikshan santhaan nahin bana saki
 He has also demolished government colleges in towns and villages
 nateeja saadhaaran logon ke bachche shiksha se bedakhal ho gaye
 Were removed from the teaching of the clavity
 media ne sirf isliye kinaaraa nahin kiya kyonki use vipaksh ko kinare karnaa tha balki isliye bhi aaj media bhi shiksha vyavastha ko lekar eemaandaar nahin he
 Prime Minister Modi has not said anything about colleges in five years
 sirf itnaa kaha ki top ten main das uniwarsity ko laane ke liye 10,000 karod denge
 You will laugh to hear what the fund actually gave
 unhone manhage santhaan banane kii niti banaai
 He recognized Ambani's college which was on paper only
 aap is sambandh main internet search kar media report dekh sakate hai
 We have also shown in prime time and written on Facebook page
 bijepi ke paas 5 saal kaa mauka tha in padon ko bharne kaa, magar use bharna nahin tha
 It was mentioned in the report of the Seventh Pay Commission that how many posts are vacant in which departments
 usee main tha ki railway main padon kii sankhya ghataani he
 i am on the internet and i have spoken on this several times in my blog from writing in my blog page 'kasba'
 pichley saal oktober kii khabar he
 The home minister reviewed vacant posts in the central forces and the Delhi Police
 pataa chalaa ki 55,000 pad khaali hai
 i wish such a review would have been earlier and filled with time so that many youngsters would get a chance before the age limit had passed
 vahi haal railway kaa tha
 The ministers were telling in the Parliament that two and a half million posts are vacant
 magar bharne kaa khyaal tab aayaa jab chunaav aayaa or berojgaare kaa mudda sar chadhakar bolne laga
 The youth should force Rahul Gandhi and the Congress to speak on it
 ve jitna zyaada bolenge tabhi pataa chalegaa ki gaanv kasbon main sarkari kalege kaa network banane ke liye ve kya-kya soch rahe hai or kaise ek saal ke bheetar 20 lakh padon ko bhar denge
 Where to bring honest examination system, how to test that no one doubts the result and litigation does not happen
 koi bhi pariksha puri hone main saal-saal kyon lagati he?vitt mantri jetali ne ek april ko dainik bhaskar se kaha he ki naukariyaan ghatane ke aarope bebuniyaad hai
 It was said earlier that if there were no jobs, there would be discontent across the country
 aaj hi bihar main bi pi es si ke parikshaarthi andolan kar rahe hai
 Examiners have marched on Ashok Rajpath in Patna
 har din kisi na kisi rajya main andolan ho rahaa he
 In Bengal, students staged a long sit-in outside the Public Service Commission
 upi main shiksha mitron ne kitni laathiyaan khain
 How many committed suicide
 shikshakon ne dharne die or laathiyaan khain
 What can be done if the Finance Minister is not seen
 upi se 69,000 shikshakon kii bhartee ke parikshaarthi messej par messej thele ja rahe hai
 Neither we nor the candidates have any understanding about the process of normalization
 unke sawaalon ko santusht nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 Same condition
 upi police kii 41,520 parikshaarthiyon kii jwining nahin karai ja rahi he
 While the examiners allege that the minister is speaking here that the job has been given
 in 41000 parikshaarthiyon ko lagata he ki agar chunaav nikal gaya to jwining nahin hogi
 Looking at the record of governments, their apprehension is right
 in 41000 chaatro main 90 pratishat mujhe gaali dete honge
 Hindus must be Muslims, yet they ask me to write or show them
 magar main isamen gaharaa sankat dekhtaa hum
 Does not take their abuses personally
 inhen kis galati kii sazaa di ja rahi he
 If they have passed the exam then joining must be done
 usee bihar main magadh unvarsity he
 This time the third year result did not come due to a legal screw
 chaatr thak gaye
 On 31 March, the opportunity to fill the railway examination form was lost
 bihar uniwarsity se chaatro ko phone aayaa tha
 The three-year BA is not completed even in five years
 chaatro ne dharna pradarshan kiya magar usamen bhi sau pachaas hi aae
 The rest of the students look after themselves and message Ravish Kumar or the media and continue to follow the policy of IPL
 chaatro kii isi raajnneetik gunvattta ke kaaran unhen murkh bananaa sambhav ho saktaa he
 Even after ruining their lives, the same political parties remain relevant among them who have not even heard of their problem
 chaatro ko hi bihar yaa kisi bhi rajya ke shiksha or pariksha vyavastha ko lekar ladanaa hoga
 They are fighting but that is not enough
 usamen kuch badalane kaa naitik bal nahin he
 The lives of two lakh people were ruined due to late session
 yahi do lakh apane maa baap ke saath gandhi maidan main nange paanv khadey ho jate to maheene bhar main sarkaar kuch karne ke liye majaboor hoti
 Media coverage will not bring tangible change
 wo maine karke dekh liye
 Today, after a year and a half, the leaders are compelled to talk but nothing concrete seems to happen
 bahes hi nahin he is par
 The success of this election will only happen when the youth force the Congress and BJP on the question of education and employment
 nayaa sochane or thos vaada karne ke liye

 kya kisi rajya kaa mukhya sachiv kisi varisht iees adhikari ko dhamkee bharaa massej bhej saktaa he
 Even a message that anyone will be surprised to hear
 lekin haryana main aisa hua he
 The chief secretary is accused of sending threatening messages to the secretary of another department
 vivaad badha to haryana ke jansampark vibhaag ne mukhya sachiv kaa wo esemes jari kiya he
 In which he has regretted
 haryana ke varisht iees or prashasnic sudhaar vibhaag ke sachiv pradeep kaasni ko somvaar subah mobile par kai dhamkee bhare or aapattijanak bhashaa vaale emesas mili
 Such was the language of an SMS received by a senior IAS officer from Haryana

 But if you have drunk your mother's milk, then show all my messages to the press
 'dhamkee mili to pradeep kaasni ne media ko saare massej dikhaa die
 It is worth noting that all these messages have been sent to Pradeep Kasani by the senior most officer of the state and Haryana Chief Secretary SAC Chaudhary
 aakhir mukhya sachiv ne duusare senior iees ko dhamkee bharaa esemes kyon bheja
 The matter is related to the Right to Service Commission and the RTEI Commission

 However Pradeep Kasani also believes that his relationship with the Chief Secretary has been better and he is a good person

 Addressing Congress workers on Monday, Ahmed Patel said that the bjp's defeat in the Lok Sabha elections is certain, as all sections of society are fed up with the policies of the BJP

 com / cybkonlkt6 Does anyone beat anyone like this! # indvban deraa sachcha sauda ke saikadon saadhuon ko jabaran napunsak banaae jane ke maamalon kii jaanch sibiai kar rahi he
 Meanwhile, the CBI team has made many shocking revelations in its report submitted to the court
 report ke mutabik gurmeet ram rahim ne varsh 1999 main samuhik taur par dere ke saadhuon ko napunsak banane kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Babagurmeet Ram Rahim, who was himself present at the time of the operation, announced in the camp that he wants to make the goods impotent so that they do not divert attention to wrong paths
 ahm baat ye ki saadhuon ko napunsak banaae jane ke vakt ram rahim khud vahaan maujuud rahata tha
 According to the CBI report, at the time of the castration operation of the sadhus, he himself was present in the operation theater
 baba kii gupha main bhi hote the opareshanasibiai kii report main kaha gaya he ki apni badnaam gupha main bhi usne jabaran kai saadhuon ko napunsak banaaya
 He used to make male monks impotent even in his infamous cave
 iske baad gurmeet ram rahim napunsak banaae gaye saadhuon ke saath kai kism ke khel bhi kheltaa tha
 He had special kindness on them
 napunsak banaae gaye sadhu gurmeet ram rahim se khulkar mil sakate the
 Most of the men who were impotent were young men who were impotent in the camp between 1999 and 2000
 unako daraa-dhamkaakar or ishwar se milaane ke naam par badhiya kiya gaya tha
 The report said that in addition to the cave, castration operations were also carried out at Shah Satnam Ji Specialty Hospital in Sirsa, Dera Printing Press Complex, Sirsa and Shah Satnam Ji General Hospital in Gursar Modia in Sriganganagar District, Rajasthan
 dere ke doctoron kii karatuthasaadhuon ko jabaran napunsak banane ke liye surgery dere ke doctor empi singh or doctor pankaj garg ne kii thi
 The CBI in this case, Dera Sacha Sauda vice-chairman Dr

 The role of Nan is also being investigated, who is currently absconding from the dera
 kharidi karodon kii sampattisibiai ne apni jaanch main khulaasa kiya he kigurmeet ram rahimanpunsak banaae gaye saadhuon se jabaran hastakshar karwaakar unke naam par benami sampattiyaan kharidta tha
 The CBI has also attached in its report a record of the 17 benami properties of the dera, which were purchased in the name of impotent sadhus
 gauratlab he ki akele haryana main deraa sachcha sauda kii 1600 karod rupee se adhik kii sampatti he
 Which includes land
 lakhanu kii ek vishesh sibiai adaalat main chal rahe ayodhya main babari masjid dhaancha giraaye jane ke aapraadhik maamle main faisla april 2020 tak aane kii sambhaavna he
 The special CBI court has fixed December 24 as the last date for prosecution to present evidence and testimony
 29 sitambar, 2019 ko aarope tay kiye jane ke baad adaalat dwaara baar-baar aadesh jari karne ke baavjood tatkaaleen mukhyamantri kalyaan singh ke khilaaf gavaah nahin laane par haal hi main abhiyojan paksh ko fatkaar lagaayi gayi thi
 On October 5, the sessions court had said that all the witnesses would have to be produced by December 24, 2019 as per the Supreme Court order and that date (in this case) would be the last working day
 bhaajapa netaaon laal krishna adwani, uma bharti or murali manohar joshi ke khilaaf sunwaayee 25 may, 2017 ko lakhanu kii is vishesh adaalat main shuru hui thi kyonki ucchtam nyaayalay ne unhen is maamle main bari karne ke elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ke faisle ko khaarij kar diya tha
 The hearing commenced in September 2019, after Singh's term as Governor of Rajasthan ended
 rajyapal ke rup main unhen kanoonee prakriya se chhot praapt thi
 When Babri Masjid was demolished on 6 December 1992, Singh was the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne 19 april 2017 se nichali adaalat ko do saal main sunwaayee puri karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 The Supreme Court again directed on 19 July 2019 that a verdict in the matter be heard in nine months
 pehle bhi to cinema kaa virodh or cinemahol par hamalaa hua he
 In the past too, there have been talk of insulting culture and religion many times
 sab kuch pehle ho chukaa he, jo 'pk' (pike) ke virodh ko lekar ho rahaa he
 Whatever is being said in favor and opposition has been said many times before
 samasya kisase he
 
 
 The To those who are cheating people or by making various rituals in the name of Baba religion, who are making films and dramas on Baba who do so
 kya dharm ke naam par logon ke saamne devtaa hone kaa daawa karne kii ghatana asli zindagi main nahin ghati he
 What Asaram and Rampal did was compatible with the dignity of religion
 'pk' film kaa poster faadane vaale kyon nahin aise baabaaon ke poster faadte hai
 Do they consider even the so-called saints who cheat in the name of religion as protectors of religion
 
 
 ? kya aasthaa ke naam par dharm kii paharedaari karne vaale in sanghathanon ko kanoonee adhikaar de diya jaae
 
 
 The It is these people who represent religion, when and who has made this decision
 varsh 2012 main bhi ek film ai thi, 'OMG, o maai god'
 
 
 The saying about 'pk' is like 'OMG'
 is film ke sah-nirmaataa paresh rawal the, jo akshay kumaar ke saath lead role main the
 The film was also opposed by Bajrang Dal, Shiv Sena and Punjab Pradesh Mahila Congress according to reports in some newspapers
 sushamaa swaraj ne aresas kii ek sabha main kaha tha ki hindu devi-devataaon par hamalaa ho rahaa he, or vah is film ke bare main loksabhaa main mudda uthaaengi
 Sushma Swaraj was in the opposition then and is now the External Affairs Minister
 'OMG' ke kalakaar or nirmaataa paresh rawal bijepi ke saansad hai or pradhanmantri ke kareebi bhi maane jate rahe hai
 Paresh Rawal did not back down at the time of protest
 unhone tab media main jo kaha tha, uskaa saar yah he ki hamane soch-samajhakar yah film banaai he
 i too believe in God, but am against expensive rituals to reach it
 'OMG' kaa virodh karne vaale kya paresh rawal ke khilaaf bhi bolenge, kyonki film to ab bhi dikhaai or dekhi jaati he
 Will the opponents explain what the status of opposition to 'OMG' is? yahaan sawaal paresh rawal yaa aamir khan ke hindu yaa musalmaan hone kaa nahin he
 The question is whether anyone can say anything against the evils arising every day in the name of religion
 'pk' film main karmkand or prapanch par vyangy he, lekin kisi ek dharm tak simit nahin he
 In the end, the film says the same thing that every religion says to love human beings and trust each other
 kya yah baat kisi bhi dharm ko behatar nahin banaati
 Were the great people struggling against sati, child marriage, untouchability, insulting Hinduism
 
 
 ? If one feels that only Hindu gods and goddesses are attacked in films, then they should watch the film 'khuda Ke Liye' by Pakistan filmmaker Shoaib Mansoor
 varsh 2007 main bani yah film 'OMG' or 'pk' se kahin zyaada diarect or behtareen he
 In 'khuda Ke Liye' Mansoor has not resorted to comedy, but has said eye to eye that Islam is not in the beard of a Muslim
 tamaam filmon or lekhon main islamic kattarpanth se lekar karmkaandon kii aalochana hui he or rose ho rahi he
 Those opposing 'pk' should listen to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech again
 yah or baat he ki ganesh ji kii plastic surgery kii baat kahkar unhone apni baat ko halkaa hi kar diya, lekin phir bhi sansad main unke bhaashan ko zyaada aupchaarik mana janaa chahie
 In June, in support of the President's address, Prime Minister Modi said that we have to liberate the poor from superstition and superstition
 ames aspataal ke ek kaarykram main pradhanmantri modi ne medical chaatro se kaha tha ki hamen vaigyanik soch kaa zyaada se zyaada vistaar karnaa he
 The age of religion and culture is several thousand years more than the age of those who do politics in the name of its danger
 dharm or samskruti ne inase pehle or inke bagaiyr bhi khatre uthaae hai or apana vajood banaae rakhaa he
 It is better that the leaders and activists of these organizations also see 'pk' and rationally oppose the film, as it becomes their right, but tearing up the posters and demanding a ban becomes a bit much
 baabaaon ke samarthan main film banaakar 'pk' kaa jawaab dene kaa idia kaisaa rahegaa
 
 
 The upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko sahyogi dal trinmul congress kii mamata banerjee or samaajawaadee party ke pramukh mulaayam singh yadav ne jhatka dete hui raashtrapati pad ke liye unke sujhaaye naamon ko kinare kar diya he
 Not only this, the leader duo has suggested the names of former President APJ Abdul Kalam, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and third name former Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee
 raashtrapati pad ke pratyaashee ke liye mulaayam singh yadav or mamata banerjee ne buudhvaar ko teen naamon par charchaa kii he
 Both leaders say that if a consensus is reached on these three names, it would be welcome
 vahiin, is khabar ke baad ensipi netaa sharad pavaar ne kaha ki ab yah jaruri he ki sabhi partiyon se ek baar phir baatcheet kii jaae
 On the statement of Mamta and Mulayam, he says that it is not right for him to say anything on any one name
 sapa or trinmul congress kii ore se raashtrapati pad ke liye sujhaaye gaye teen naamon par bhaajapa ne aaj charchaa kii lekin kaha ki congress dwaara is sheersh sanvaidhanik pad ke ummidavaar kii ghoshnaa kiye jane ke baad hi vah apni pratikriya degi
 Meanwhile, PMO office minister Narayanasamy went to meet the finance minister and details of the talks have not been received
 congress party ne der shaam yah ghoshnaa kii ki unki pasand kaa hi ummidavaar raashtrapati chunaav main jeet hasil karegaa
 Sources are also telling that after the Prime Minister returns from abroad, the matter will be discussed and the final decision for the name of the President will also be taken when the PM comes home
 gauratlab he ki kuch ghanton pehle hi mamata banerjee ne sonia gandhi se mulaakaat karne ke baad kaha ki apni party trinmul ke netaaon se salaah lekar vah koi antim faisla lengi
 However, Mamata made it clear that Pranab Mukherjee is the first choice of Congress President Sonia Gandhi as the presidential candidate, while she wants to see the current Vice President Hamid Ansari as the second choice
 is mulaakaat ke baad mamata banerjee sidhe mulaayam singh yadav ke ghar gayi or kaha ja rahaa he ki vahaan par bhi mamata banerjee raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar ke bare main charchaa karengi
 Earlier, before the meeting of West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee reached Delhi on the call of Congress and UPA President Sonia Gandhi, sources had informed that Pranab Mukherjee's name is at the bottom of Mamta's list, While his choice was former West Bengal Governor Gopal Gandhi, Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar and former President APJ a Dul Kalam sources were telling him
 haalanki sonia se mulaakaat se pehle mangalvaar ko mamata kii samaajawaadee party pramukh mulaayam singh yadav se milanaa nae sameekaran kii sugabugahat ke taur par dekha ja rahaa tha or mana ja rahaa tha ki mamata ne raashtrapati pad kii upie kii ore se ummidavaari ke liye vittamantri pranab mukherjee ke naam par sahmati de di he
 He had also said that he would be happy with this, if a leader of Bengal comes to this highest post of the country
 parantu unki yah bhi ichha he ki congress pehle apane pattey khole, or ummidavaar ke rup main pranab ke naam kaa elaan kare
 The comments duusari ore, congress apni ore se ummidavaar chunane kaa adhikaar sonia gandhi ko de chuki he, lekin unhen yah bhi dhyaan he ki congress ke paas apane itane vot nahin hai ki ve apane ummidavaar ko nishchit jeet dilaa saken, isliye mulaayam singh kii sapa or mamata kii trinmul kaa saath congress ke liye anivaary hoga, or shaayad isiilie sonia gandhi apni ore se ummidavaar kaa elaan karne se pehle puri tasalli kar lenaa chaahati hai
 At present, the Congress claims that the entire UPA is one in this case, and their claim is also bolstered by the fact that Mayawati's BSP, and Karunanidhi's DMK have also agreed on Pranab's name
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki congress shuukravaar, 15 june tak yah masalaa nipta lenaa chaahati he, or isiilie pranab ne 14 taarikh se shuru hone vaala apana kabul daura radd kar diya he, jisase phir atakalein lagane lagi hai
 It is also important to know in this issue that Prime Minister Dr
 Manmohan Singh is going to visit Brazil and Mexico from 16 June, and soon the UPA President will also be going abroad for treatment
 is bich, rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) ne bhi aisa bayaan diya he, jo ishaaron main hi sahi, pranab ke haq main ja rahaa he, so, saare ishaare yahi bataa rahe hai ki pranab desh ke nae mahamahim banane kii daud main sabase aage hai, lekin mushkil sirf itani he ki congress ne abhi aadhikarik taur par unka naam nahin liya he
 Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mamata Banerjee have discussed three names on Wednesday for the presidential candidate
 donon netaaon kaa kahana he ki yadi in teenon naamon par ek sahmati ban jaati he to vah swaagat yogya hoga
 At the same time, after this news NCP leader Sharad Pawar said that now it is necessary that all the parties once again have a dialogue
 mamata or mulaayam ke bayaan par unka kahana he ki kisi ek naam par unka kuch kahana philhal thik nahin he
 The BJP today discussed the three names suggested by the SP and Trinamool Congress for the presidency but said it would react only after the Congress announced the top constitutional nominee
 udhar der shaam piemo karyaalay ke mantri narayansami vittamantri se milane gaye or baatcheet kaa byoraa hasil nahin ho paaya he
 The Congress party announced late in the evening that the candidate of their choice would win the presidential election
 sutara yah bhi bataa rahe hai pradhanmantri ke videsh se lautne ke baad is maamle par charchaa kii jaaegi or raashtrapati pad ke liye naam bhi antim faisla piem ke swadesh aane par liya jayega
 Significantly, after meeting Sonia Gandhi a few hours ago, Mamata Banerjee said that she would take a final decision after consulting the leaders of her party's Trinamool
 vaise mamata ne saaf kiya ki raashtrapati pad ke pratyaashee ke rup main congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii pehali pasand pranab mukherjee hi hai, jabaki duusari pasand ke taur par vartmaan uparashtrapati hamid ansaari ko vah sheersh pad par dekhnaa chaahati hai
 After this meeting, Mamta Banerjee went directly to Mulayam Singh Yadav's house and it is being said that Mamta Banerjee will discuss about the presidential candidate there too
 isse pehle, congress va upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke bulaave par dilli pahunchin pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri va trinmul congress kii pramukh mamata banerjee kii sonia se hui mulaakaat se pehle sutron ne jaankaree di thi ki mamata kii list main pranab mukherjee kaa naam sabase neeche he, jabaki unki pasand ke taur par pashchim bengal ke purv rajyapal gopal gandhi, loksabhaa adhyaksh mira kumaar or purv raashtrapati apije abdul kalam ke naam sutron ne bataae the
 However, meeting Mamata's Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav on Tuesday before meeting Sonia was seen as a murmur of new equations and it was believed that Mamata had asked Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee for upa's candidature for the presidency
 Has agreed in the name of
 unhone kaha bhi tha ki is baat se unhen khushi hogi, yadi desh ke is sarvocch pad par bengal kaa koi netaa aae
 But he also wishes that the Congress opens its cards first, and declares Pranab's name as a candidate
 tippaniyan On the other hand, the Congress has given the right to choose the candidate on its behalf to Sonia Gandhi, but she is also aware that the Congress does not have enough votes to give its candidate a definite victory, hence Mulayam Singh's SP and Mamta That Trinamool's support will be compulsory for the Congress, and perhaps that's why Sonia Gandhi wants to be fully satisfied before announcing the candidate on her behalf
 philhal congress kaa daawa he ki is maamle main puraa upie ek he, or unke is daawey ko is baat se bhi bal miltaa he ki mayawati kii bispi, or karunanidhi kii diemke bhi pranab ke naam par sahmati jataa chuke hai
 It is also being said that the Congress wants to settle this issue by Friday, June 15, and that is why Pranab has canceled his visit to Kabul starting on the 14th, which has led to speculation again
 is mudde main yah jaankaree bhi ahm he ki pradhanmantri dow manmohan singh 16 june se brazil va mexico kii yatra par ja rahe hai, or jald hi upie adhyaksh bhi ilaaj ke liye videsh jane vaali hai
 Meanwhile, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has also made such a statement, which is going right in the direction of Pranab, so all the gestures are saying that Pranab is in the forefront of becoming the new highness of the country
 But the only problem is that the Congress has not officially named him yet
 vahiin, is khabar ke baad ensipi netaa sharad pavaar ne kaha ki ab yah jaruri he ki sabhi partiyon se ek baar phir baatcheet kii jaae
 On the statement of Mamta and Mulayam, he says that it is not right for him to say anything on any one name
 sapa or trinmul congress kii ore se raashtrapati pad ke liye sujhaaye gaye teen naamon par bhaajapa ne aaj charchaa kii lekin kaha ki congress dwaara is sheersh sanvaidhanik pad ke ummidavaar kii ghoshnaa kiye jane ke baad hi vah apni pratikriya degi
 Meanwhile, PMO office minister Narayanasamy went to meet the finance minister and details of the talks have not been received
 congress party ne der shaam yah ghoshnaa kii ki unki pasand kaa hi ummidavaar raashtrapati chunaav main jeet hasil karegaa
 Sources are also telling that after the Prime Minister returns from abroad, the matter will be discussed and the final decision for the name of the President will also be taken when the PM comes home

 Senior BJP leader Shivraj Singh Chauhan on Sunday compared Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah to Lord Krishna and Arjuna for the Centre's decision to abolish special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370
 unhone congress ke purv adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko ‘ranchhod das gandhi' qaraar diya, jinhone loksabhaa chunaav main mili shikast ke baad party ko ‘parityakt' kar diya he, jab vah sabase mushkil daur se guzar rahi he
 Praising Modi and Shah for the Center's decision on Jammu and Kashmir, Chauhan said, "the country is moving forward under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah
" ve krishna or arjuna kii tarah desh ko aage le jane main vyast hai
 Claiming to be confused over Article 370 of the Congress, he demanded the interim president of the party, Sonia Gandhi, to issue a statement on the issue
 chouhan ne samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, ‘jammu-kashmir kaa vishesh darja khatm karne ke centre ke aitihaasik faisle par congress netaa alag-alag sur main bol rahe hai, jabaki sonia gandhi is maamle par chup hai
 The Congress is confused about how to react to the decision of the Center
 'madhya pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri or bhaajapa ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh goa kii rajdhani main party kaaryakartaaon ke sammelan ko sambodhit karne aae hai
 The Center's decision on Jammu and Kashmir was supported by some Congress leaders, including Jyotiraditya Scindia, while the party opposed the State Reorganization Bill in Parliament
 haalanki, party ne baad main kaha ki jis tarah se vidheyak ko sattarudh dal kii ore se sansad main pesh kiya gaya vah uske khilaaf he
 The former chief minister said, 'since many Congress leaders are speaking in different voices on this issue, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have not said anything on this issue till now
 aise main main sonia gandhi ji se maang karata hum ki vah bayaan jari kar is mudde par apana rukh spasht karen
 He said that he does not expect any statement from Rahul Gandhi on the issue
 congress kii bagdor ek baar phir sonia gandhi ko dene par unhone kaha ki party yah sunishchit karne main juty he ki sanghathan par ek hi parivaar kaa ekadhikaar kamjor na ho
 Chauhan attributed the wrong policies of former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to the suffering of the people of Jammu and Kashmir and the former Portuguese colony Goa
 unhone kaha, ‘ nehru kii galat nitiyaan bharat kii aazaadee ke baad bhi varshon tak goa ke portugali upnivesh bane rahane ke liye jimmedaar raheen
 Goa prospered after independence and similarly Jammu and Kashmir will develop after abolishing Article 370
 'saath hi chouhan ne kaha ki nehru yuddh ke baad pakistan ke kabje vaala kashmir (pioke) banane ke liye jimmedaar hai
 He alleged, "when the Indian Armed Forces were pushing the Pakistani troops back, Nehru declared a unilateral ceasefire and the pok remained in their possession, otherwise it would have become an integral part of India

 To know the reasons for suicide, PL Punia said that 'see this Rohit Vemula's suicide case is very unfortunate and sad and we have demanded those who are guilty for this and who put so much pressure on Rohit, the reason for which Committed suicide
 uske kaarnon kaa pataa lagaaya jaae or un logon ko aaidentifai kiya jaae or bhavishya main is tarah kii ghatana na ho iske bare main bataaya jaae

 "BJP Ministers carried out investigation" Very clearly, the Commission also released its finding but from the very first day the bjp's ministers are their ministers saying with a voice that the schedule is not cast is OBC
 bhai jaanch to inke mantriyon ne kar lee he or nyaayik ayog aisa baithaaya jo mohar laga de
 But the reality is that he was a schedule cast who is District Collector Guntur, his report is the report of National Commission for Scheduled Castes and according to him he belongs to Scheduled Caste

 These players, who will represent India on Bamboonomics in COP-14, gave an unmatched formula to strengthen the Adivasi economy
 They were part of the Indian Premier League (IPL) Gujarat Lions team and Shelley Shaurya, who played Ranji Trophy for Manipur Has given an unmatched formula to strengthen the economy
 unke formule par modi sarkaar amal bhi kar rahi he
 The 25-year-old Shelley Shaurya has given the theory on Bamboonomics, which can help to control the growing pollution along with good earnings from bamboo
 COP-14 main 196 desh hissaa le rahe handrasal, modi sarkaar bans aadhaarit arthvyavastha lagu karke adivaasiyon ko sakasham or sampann bananaa chaahati he
 This is the reason that in 2017, bamboo was removed from the category of trees and declared as grass

 6 crore hectares will do
 modi ne marusthalikaran se nipatane ke liye kaha ki 2015 or 2017 ke bich bharat main ped or jangal ke daayre main 8 lakh hectare kii badhotaree hui he
 North Eastern states will benefit more: Shelley, a graduate in economics from St
 Stephen's College in Philly, will get the most benefit from the riches she has received at Bamboonomics, which leaves the North Eastern states with many plans and development benefits due to geographical conditions

 When Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed the bamboo from the Indian Forest Act 1927 and informed the grass, he had a dream of welfare of tribals
 us sapane ko aage badhaane ke liye shelli shaury ne bamboonomics:the Tall Grass Comes of Age' naam kii ek kitaab bhi likhi thi or shodh kiya jisaki report The Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (TRIFED) trifed main surakshit he
 On 9 September, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also reached this conference in collaboration with TRIFED, which was running from 2 September
 is dauraan unhone ghoshnaa karte hue kaha tha ki bharat 2030 tak 2
 2, increasing its target to make 1 crore hectares of barren land fertile
 6 karod hectare karegaa
 To tackle desertification, Modi said that between 2015 and 2017, the area of trees and forests in India has increased by 8 lakh hectares
 uttar purvi rajyon ko hoga zyada phaaydasheli ne bharat sarkaar ke janajaatiy mantralay kii ore se TRIFED ke saath milakar jo research karke jo upaay bataaya wo sasta hone ke saath marketeble bhi he
 Because of this it is linked to the Jan Dhan Yojana of Modi government
 saath hi marusthalikaran se bachaane kii ek nai raah dikhaata he
 Actually, they can get good profits from the bamboo grown by the tribals
 iske liye TRIFED kii ore se adivasee bahul kshetra main bans ko bambu charcol or activated charcol main parivartit karne ke liye aware kiya ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, the bamboo which was sold for 40 to 80 rupees can be converted into activated charcoal and sold for two to two and a half thousand
 activated charcol kii jarurat sabase adhik FMGC industry ko he
 Also, Shelley's theory will also help India achieve the target set under the Bonn Challenge and 4P1000 Initiative
 neshnal bambu main nibhaayaa ahm roleaaathshinaidh ke emdi praveer krishna ne bataaya ki aaj se bharat sarkaar kaa janajaatiy mantralay duniya kii ek sabase badi janajaatiy muhim chalaane ja rahaa he
 In this, the National Babu Mission with a capacity of 1203 crore budget will be very important
 is mishan main shelli ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai he
 Shelley has described in research how the best waste can be used to make bamboo products
 pehle 80 se 88% manuphaccharing ke dauraan phenk diya jaataa tha yaa barbaad ho jaataa tha, aise main ab uskaa sadupyog hoga
 Also, the production capacity of the soil will be increased by the charcoal that will come from Babu Charcoal
 global market kaa rasta khulaayemdi ne bataaya ki International German organization GIZ aaj TRIFED ke saath jud gai he
 The path of the global market has opened
 adivasee utpaada jo aaj tak sirf hindustan main the wo puure duniya main failane vaale hai
 Explain that 136 types of bamboo species found in India were listed under Bainbu Mission
 isamen sirf 10 prajatiyaan hi bijness ke liye upyukt bataai gai thim, jabaki shelli ne 126 bans kii kism ko bijness ke liye upyogi bataaya he

 haalanki is bich haar ke kaarnon par manthan ke liye aap netaa mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke ghar ekatra hue hai
 It is worth mentioning that when exit poll came before the results of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi elections, Gopal Rai had said something similar
 us vakt jab gopal raay se poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki agar EVM kii chalati he to ye survey sahi he, balki hamaari haalat isse bhi buree ho sakati he, lekin agar janata kii chali to aam aadmi party aaj number 1 par he or bahut bade margin se aam aadmi party chunaav jeetegi

 He also alleged that despite having valid voter slips, many voters were not allowed to exercise their franchise in the municipal elections
 gauratlab he ki kejariwal ne pehle maang kii thi ki vivipieti se las iviem se matdaan karaane kaa intjaam kiye jane tak chunaav taal die jaaen

 ullekhneey he ki dilli nagar nigam chunaav ke nattejey aane se pehle jab agsit pole aae the to gopal raay ne kuch isi andaaj main baat kahi thi

 Aam Aadmi Party will win the election by margin

 In the book titled Seven Secrets of the Goddess, Devdatta Patnaik has not only explained the importance of Goddess worship from Greece to Hindustan, but has also encouraged to describe such different forms of Divine woman in the society, whose Perhaps our society does not have the courage to think about it

 Recently, when blackberry launched the Android-based DTEK50 smartphone, the company was hinted at ending the hardware business
 kyonki us smartphone kaa development blueberi ne nahin tisiel kii sahyogi company alcatel ne kiya tha
 Now the company has officially announced the closure of the mobile business
 kuch maheene pehle company ke siio jon shen ne bhi saaf kar diya tha ki agar sitambar tak mobile bijness phaayde main nahin aayaa to ise band kar diya jayega
 September arrived and the company and apparently the company decided to shut down its mobile business due to no profit
 haalanki aisa nahin he ki aane vaale dinon main nae blueberi ke smartfones dekhne ko nahin milenge
 Because the company has said that it will develop hardware from its partner companies
 yani company kuch or smartphone launch kar sakati he jisamen blueberi kii hi branding hogi
 However, now the two big mobile companies of the world, which once used to be market leaders, are currently out of the market
 america president baraak obama behatar security ke liye blueberi ke smartphone yuj karte the, lekin ab aisa nahin he kyonki blueberi kii girte graph kii vajah se america president ne bhi ise yuj karnaa band kar diya he
 blackberry's identity was its QWERTY keyboard and a red light that made it stand out from other phones
 ham aapako yah blueberi ke hit or flop mobile ke bare main bataaenge jisase ye samajhnaa aasaan hoga ki aakhir kyon band ho gaya iskaa mobile bijnesabhlchcbherre Quark 6210 (hit)ise itihaas main logon ko sabase zyada prabhavit karne vaala gajet mana ja saktaa he
 It was launched about 13 years ago in 2003 and was then called a smartphone
 isamen email, web broujar, esemes or blueberi massenger jaise fitures the jiske vajah se bijness yugers iske diwane the
 With blackberry Pearl (hit) multimedia and messaging features, this phone rocked the mobile market in 2007
 isamen pehali baar trekkbal diya gaya tha
 Apart from this, a two-letter keyboard was given in a button, due to which it looked slim
 iske kai varjan launch hue
 blackberry Curve (hit) If you have not been a blackberry user, you must have heard its name
 2007 main launch hua yah smartphone kaaphi popular hua
 It was given a full keyboard with trackball and its price was not too heavy
 iske compact dizin or fitures ne duusare blueberi phone kii tarah na sirf bijness yugers ko lubhaaya, balki aam yugers ne bhi ise kaaphi pasand kiya
 Many of its variants were launched and a variant of this was also used by American President Obama
 blackberry Bold (hit)curve phone ke hi tarj par company ne 2008 main yah smartphone launch kiya
 It also had a keyboard and trackball, but it was more premium than the Curve because it had a leather back
 isamen behatar camera bhi diya gaya
 The company launched it again in 2009 and 2010
 haalanki kai exparts kaa maananaa he ki is smartphone ke saath hi blueberi kii saakh girane lagi thi kyonki bazaar main kai behatar smartphone aane lage the
 blackberry Z10 (flop) In 2013, blackberry launched the Z10 smartphone with the BB10 operating system for the first time
 company iske saath hi apane popular QWARTY keyboard ko hataane kii koshish kii or phul tach screen ke jariye bazaar main pakad banane kii koshish kii
 However, the company failed to compete with the Android smartphones of Apple and Samsung
 iske baad company ne Q10 launch kiya jisamen phir se company ne phul keyboard diya lekin wo BB10 oes par hi chalata tha
 The company proved to be a failure with the new smartphone on this platform
 blackberry Passport (flop)passport ke sies vaala yah scovair smartphone launch hone ke baad exparts or customers ne alag alag raay di
 On the one hand, experts described it as a great option, but the general public rejected this huge smartphone completely and it flopped
 haalanki isamen bada keyboard or behatar camere ne kuch bijness tabake ko utsahit jarur kiya tha
 Android and Apple took possession of the blackberry Priv (flop) market and blackberry's debacle began to sink
 company ne ek aitihaasik faisla lete hue android smartphone laane kaa elaan kiya taaki phir company main nai jaan foonki ja sake
 The smartphone was launched in 2015 and interestingly, this smartphone is quite good
 lekin isaki zyada keemton kii ne ise flop karne main kai kasar nahin chodi
 The huge smartphone market like India also rejected it
 ise blueberi mobile ke taabut main aakhri keel kii tarah mana ja saktaa he
 After launching the blackberry DTEK 50 (flop) Priv, the company understood that the Android smartphone was being hit at such a huge price
 isliye company ne android besd ek bajet smartphone launch kiya or ise duniya kaa sabase sicyor smartphone bataaya
 But by now it was quite late
 samsung or duusari chini companiyaan smartphone bazaar main kabja jamaa chuki thim or company kaa yah smartphone bhi fail ho gaya

 This is the time when you have to exert a little bit of force, because the habit, thinking and sociality that you have to change is a deep, very old thought that has been frozen for years
 ye dusron ke saath khud ko badalane kaa bhi vakt he
 Time to walk, and time to let go
 ise badalane ke liye koshish bhi lambii hi hogi, kyonki ye hamaari aadat main gahari baith gai he
 When we start driving, we consider pedestrians to be hindered and forget how much the arbitrariness of the vehicles bothers us when we get out on foot
 or is friction ke bich tanaav itnaa bad jaataa he ki paidal or gaadi vaala donon hi aapa kho dete hai
 Without realizing that our traffic system has gone into a vicious cycle, stopping it is a big challenge
 isi kaa nateeja he ki har din kii shuruyaat ab sadakon par "dikhaai nahin detaa", "andhaa he kya", "kinare kyon nahin chal saktaa he", "khudakushi kaa shauq he kya" jaise dialog se hoti he
 And if this is the beginning, then the whole day will be like, it can be guessed
 ab thodi tasalli se dekhie to pataa chal jayega ki ye dushchakra darasal kaafii sidhaa saral he
 The first part is flagging
 deshbhar kii sadakon ko dekhen to aapako pataa chalegaa ki kahin par bhi futapaath nahin hai
 There are also sidewalks, either they have been occupied by the street vendors or are being used as dustbin or the sidewalks are so high that climbing and descending is impossible or it is in such a broken condition that it is difficult to walk
 it happens
 or phir iskaa nateeja - log sadakon par paidal chalane ko majaboor
 The second part is, where will the vehicles go when they walk on the streets? And it is here that there is such tension and such conflict that we face every day
 or is takaraav kaa nateeja kya hota he? salanaa 15 hazaar ke aasapaas paidal yatriyon kii maut
 In which it is understandable that behind these deaths is not the mistake of only the vehicles
 galati chaahe driver kii ho, paidal yatri kii ho yaa phir prashasan kii, nateeja bhugatte hai paidal yatri hi
 That is why they are called the most unsafe road user
 teesraa hissaa yah he ki sadak par din-ba-din badhate khoff or asuvidha ke chalate log ab har qeemat par paidal chalane se batch rahe hai
 Using a scooter if not a car
 ab subah kii saiyr se lekar sabzi laane tak ke liye middle class car yaa scooter par ja rahaa he
 That is, pedestrians are assuming that they are no longer on the road
 lekin un logon kaa kya jinaki majaburi he paidal chalanaa, desh kii tees fisadi aabaadi
 Who does not own his car or two wheeler
 unka kya? unka hashr ham dekh hi rahe hai
 Recently, there have been figures of death of pedestrians in Delhi
 jo chaunkaane vaale hai, lekin kam hi log chaunk rahe hai
 In 2013, a total of 749 pedestrians lost their lives in Delhi
 dilli kii trekkic, gair-zimmedaar driver, logon kii laaparvaahee or karaab road dizine ne saadhe saat sau pariwaron ko zindgibhar kaa dukh de diya
 And imagine how bad the situation in Delhi is that 41% of those killed in road accidents are pedestrians
 jabaki deshbhar main ye ausat das fisadi se kuch hi upar he
 Now the Delhi Traffic Police is trying something
 police ne logon se phir futapaath par haq jataane kii apil kii he
 And it is also said that wherever you see any kind of blockage, occupation or parked vehicles on the sidewalk, do not ignore it
 uske photo khinche or trekkic police ke fesabook pej yaa watsap par bhejein
 Therefore the mobile number is also given for 8750871493
 
 
 
 There is a need to start such a campaign in all the cities from now on, to make people think
 agar aaj ham ye koshish nahin karenge to phir aane vaale kal main ye samasya aisi shakl le legi jiskaa andaaza lagaana aaj se kuch saal pehle naammumkin tha
 Some people have tried to walk, by the name of Rahgiri and in many parts of the country, on Sunday morning, they are now walking on one of the corners of the city by stopping trains
 sabhi shaharon main chalane ke aise haq ko waapas lene kii zarurat he, or din ke chand ghante nahin, choubees ghante

 tmc's income was the highest in 2015-16, the same year the assembly elections were held in West Bengal

 Major General Verma (retd) said that when the parties see donations above Rs 20,000, a very interesting situation arises
 agar 2014-15 or 2015-16 kii tulana kii jaae to congress or sipiai kii aay main aise donneton kii tej badhotaree hui
 At the same time, such donations to the BJP reduced from 21 lakhs to 1
 31 lakh rupee hi rah gaya
 The remaining five national parties said in the declaration that they received 20,000 rupees
 se upar koi donneton nahin mila
 The last date for submission of annual audit accounts report for the year 2016-17 for national parties was 30 October 2017

 Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while rejecting the allegations being leveled against the government in the Rafale case, targeted Congress President Rahul Gandhi and said that "the backing of the family name does not give the Prime Minister the right to say abusive language
" ''sadan main rafel mudde par hui charchaa ke jawaab main sitaraman ne congress or congress adhyaksh ke sabhi aaropon ko khaarij kar diya
 Congress members walked out of the House, expressing dissatisfaction with Rahul Gandhi not being given a chance to clarify again after the Defense Minister's reply and not allowing Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge to speak
 sadan main raksha mantri ke bayaan par spashtikaran maangate hue congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha ki ‘ main raksha mantri sitaraman yaa purv raksha mantri manohar parrikar par aarope nahin laga rahaa hum
 My direct charge is on Prime Minister Modi and i am clear that he is involved in this case
 'unhone poocha ki raksha mantri is sawaal kaa jawaab den ki echeel ke bajaay anil ambani ko sauda dilaane kaa nirnay kisne liya
 At the time of UPA, the price of L-1 class aircraft which was Rs 560 crores, how did it become Rs 1600 crores during your time
 unhone france ke raashtrapati emenual maikron se apni nijee baatcheet or purv raashtrapati fransava oland ke bayaan kaa zikr kiya
 Rahul said that Hollande had said in his statement that Anil Ambani's name for the offset partner was given by the Prime Minister of India and the Government of India and i had only requested the Prime Minister that if Hollande was misinformed, he would give him Call and ask not to give such statement
 raksha mantri ne kaha ki rahul gandhi yahaan apana naam liye jane par chintit hai
 He said that i was called a liar in this House, the Prime Minister was called abusive in some places
 tab congress ke logon ko koi afsos nahin tha
 Do we not have any respect? Taking a dig at the Congress president, he said, "the name of the family behind does not give anyone the right to say abusive words to the Prime Minister
" main saamaanya prishthbhumi se aati hum or mujhe apane sammaan kaa bachaav karne kaa haq he
 Sitharaman said that the Prime Minister too has arrived here from a poor background and his image is impeccable
 raksha mantri ne vipaksh ke kuch sadasyon ke uthaaye sawaalon ke jawaab main kaha ki is tarah ke mahatvapurn nirnyon main pradhanmantri karyaalay (piemo) ko har str par nigaraanee kaa adhikaar he or ise hastkshep nahin kaha ja saktaa
 He said that if this is the case then there will be many cases of such alleged interference of the UPA government
 samprag ke samay kii rashtriya salaahkaar parishad (enesi) to samaantar cabinet chalaa rahi thi
 He emphasized that the deal done during the current government is better and cheaper than the UPA government and the Congress is running a misleading campaign

 iran se kachche tel kii aapurti prabhavit hone ke andeshe se kachche tel kii keemton main teji kaa rukh lagaataar bana hua he
 Brent crude has crossed $ 75 per barrel and it is expected that it may cross $ 80 per barrel
 yah vahi str he jisaki vajah se upie sarkaar main mahangaai kaaphi bad gai thi
 Crude oil crossed $ 80 per barrel level in July 2008, reaching $ 132 in July
 america lite crude dablyootiai kaa bhav bhi 66 dollar prati bairal se upar chal rahaa he
 According to news agency IANS, energy experts believe that the US embargo on Iran may cause the oil supply crisis to breach $ 80 a barrel in the near future, with fears of further deepening
 modi sarkaar kii takadir acchhee rahigauratlab he ki varsh 2014 ke aam chunaav main mahangaai mukhya chunavi mudda tha
 High fuel prices played a decisive role in the defeat of the ruling UPA
 varsh 2011 se 2014 ke bich kachche tel kaa ausat bhav 108 dollars prati bairal rahaa tha jisase rosemara kii vasteen kaaphi mahangi ho gayi thim
 In its second innings, the UPA government struggled to contain inflation
 satta virdohi lahar ke kaaran aam chunaav main narendra modi ko prachand bahut mila
 After becoming Prime Minister, Modi had the good luck that the prices of crude oil continued to fall
 bhartiya basket main iske bhav may 2014 main 113 dollars prati bairal se ludhak kar janvari 2015 main 50 dollars ke str par aa gaye
 After this, he remained in this realm for a long time
 kyon ai tejiiran par america pratibandh main bharat samet kuch pramukh deshon ko di gai chhot do may ke baad aage nahin badhaane kii ghoshnaa ke baad kachche tel ke daam main teji kaa rukh bana hua he
 Although in the meantime, there was a break on the pace after reports of increasing oil reserves in the US, but it did not last long
 kachche tel kaa bhav badhane se bharat main petrol or dijal phir mahange ho jaaenge
 However, the Indian government has claimed that the supply of oil is sufficient
 urja visheshgy narendra taneja kaa kahana he ki bharat sarkaar kii chintaa tel kii aapurti se kahin zyada antarrashtriya bazaar main tel kii badhati keemat he
 He said that due to the impact of oil imports from Iran, in the coming days in the international market, the price of Brent crude can go up to $ 80 per barrel, which is a concern for India
 bharat ne pehle se hi iran se tel kaa aayaat kam kar diya he or isamen 50 fisadi tak kii giravat aa chuki he
 Iran is one of the major oil producing countries of the world and there is already a sharp rise in prices due to the decrease in oil supply from there
 pichley saal bhi brent crude kaa bhav 86 dollar prati bairal tak chalaa gaya tha joki 2014 ke baad kaa sabase unchaa str tha
 Significantly, the production of oil by OPEC and non-opec country Russia is being cut by 1
2 million barrels daily since January this year, due to which the price of oil has been going up this year
 is bich venezuela par america pratibandh se is teji ko or sahaara mila
 a report by the US Agency for Energy Information Administration 
 2018 main iran kaa rojaanaa utpaadan 44
 Was 7 million barrels
 abhi or teji aa sakati hakedia camodity ke diarector ajay kedia ne kaha ki opek or gaiyr-opek desh rus dwaara tel ke utpaadan main is saal janvari se 12 lakh bairal rojaanaa kii katautee kii ja rahi he jiske kaaran is saal tel ke daam main teji kaa rukh rahaa he
 Meanwhile, this boom was further supported by the US embargo on Venezuela
 kedia ne kaha ki opek kii june main hone vaali baithak main tel kaa utpaadan badhaane yaa tay katautee main kami karne kaa faisla le saktaa he, isse pehle aapurti sankat ke kaaran keemton ko saport miltaa rahegaa
 In such a situation, there is no doubt that Brent crude can go up to $ 80 per barrel
 aage america main july-agast main tufaan kaa sijan shuru hone se pehle tel ke kuon ko rakrakhaav ke liye may main kuch samay ke band kiya ja saktaa he, jisase utpaadan main kami aa sakati he
 This may also be one of the reasons for the further rise in oil prices

 Like Parsai, Shilpi Marwah's Sukhmanch group was playing Manto's women at the Lok Kala Manch Auditorium on Lodi Road on the stories of famous writer Saadat Hasan Manto from the 1940s
 usamen bhi 1984 ke or aaj ke dangon ke alaava priyanka (chopra), deepika (padukon) vagairah kii shaadiyon ke zikr aae to ant main ek darshak puch hi baitha, "kisi lekhak ke likhe hue main jodgaye kii kis had tak chhot lee ja sakati he?''jawaab main nirdeshak shilpi ne safagoi barti, "itani hi ki uskaa mul bhav bana rahe or aaj se conect karne ke liye thodaa-sa ham usamen taaja reference daal saken
 There may be many answers to this, but one of the motives of theatrical productions was to raise questions about the discrepancies surrounding the audience's mind, it was a success of this drama
 dilli main vidaa hote disambar kii shaamon ke dahaai ke neeche ludhakte paare ne theatre ke halake main garmaahat laa di he
 Last week, four theater festivals were going on simultaneously: Sahitya Kala Parishad's Yuva Natya Samaroh (kamani Auditorium), Panna Bharatram Festival (shriram Center), Sanjha Sapna (LTG) and weekend-run Sukhmanch Winter Festival (focused on 5 young directors)
 Folk art forum)
 yah dekhnaa dilachasp tha ki sabhi utsavon main darshakon kii paryaapt or sakaaratmak maujuudagi thi
 At the inauguration of the Youth Festival, the Nautanki style inspired modern musical, Mithileshwar Liked Babuji (director Rajesh Singh) had an attendance of over 600 in the auditorium
 ek chota baccha saas ko bhi saath laai maa se puch rahaa tha, "mummy! naachne vaale ko babuji kehete hai?'' 24 disambar ko saptaah kaa pehla din hone ke baavjood shriram centre main nayana sagar nirdeshit, joseph kesalring kii likhi blike kamedi arsenic and di old les ko sau ke kareeb darshak mil gaye the
 From their discussions it seemed that they had read it or were watching a film made on it
 haalanki shriram centre rapertary kii yah koi bahut lay vaali umdaa prastuti nahin thi
 Audiences often find disappointment in plays, but next time they come up with a new dream in their eyes
 sanjha sapana utsav main jab udghaatan prakriya thodi lambii hone lagi to kuch darshak besabri main bolne lage, "yaar ham naatak dekhne aae hai
 However, 4,000 viewers watched the plays in 4-5 days in four auditoriums with a total capacity of around 1,600
 in utsavon main shaamil grups ke alaava duusare natya dalon ke liye bhi yah acchhee khabar he
 There is a rift between the Center and the Delhi government over the Delhi Metro fare hike
 kejariwal sarkaar metro ke kiraye ko badhaane kaa virodh kar rahi he or andolan kii dhamkee de rahi he
 But is it really a protest against Kejriwal and his government with the intention of increasing the fare or is it all just a political stunt to take sympathy of the passengers of the metro
 aaj tak ke paas dillimetro kii kiraayanirdhaaran samiti kii report maujuud he, is report ko padhane or isaki siforeeshon ko jaanane ke baad bahut sari baaten spasht ho rahi hai, jisase maujuuda raajnneetik hai-tauba ko bhi samajha ja saktaa he
 The Delhi government was well aware of the fact that how much and when the fare of the metro has been increasing since exactly one year from now
 kyonki kiraaya nirdhaaran samiti ne sitambar 2016 main apni report saunp di thi
 The member of which himself was the Chief Secretary of the Government of Delhi
 agar ye maan bhi liya jaae ki dilli sarkaar ne kiraaya badhaane kaa virodh kiya tha to phir may 2017 main kiraaya kaise bad gaya or tab sarkaar kii taraf se koi bayaan yaa chitthee kyon nahin ai
 While the reality is that a major part of the increase in Metro fares was implemented only in May 2017
 kyonki ausat 91 fisadi badhotaree prastaavit thi, jisamen se 51 fisadi badhotaree may 2017 main hi kar di gai thi or ab hangaamaa baaki bache 27 fisadi badhotaree vaale charan par ho rahaa he
 Which is to come into effect from 10 October
 kaise aam metro musafir ko kiya gaya nazarandaazakhirkiraaya badhaane ko lekarasmiti ne jo daleelein deen wo hairaan karne vaali hai
 It has been argued that there has been an increase in the salary of the government employees and the increase in the minimum wage, but the committee very carefully ignored those who do not fall in these categories
 berojgaare ke aankade or skool-college main padhane vaale chaatro kii jeb kaa bhi koi khyaal nahin rakhaa gaya
 How the fixed fare increased The fourth fare fixation committee was formed in 2016 to fix the new fare for Delhi Metro
 9 june 2016 ko cameti ke adhyaksh ritred justise emel mehta ne kaarybhaar sambhala
 Apart from him, there were two more members in the committee, which included KK Sharma, the then Chief Secretary of the Delhi Government and DS Mishra, the then Additional Secretary of the Union Urban Development Ministry
 mishra ab shahari vikaas mantralay ke hi secretary hai or is naate wo dilli metro rail corporation ke chairmen bhi hai
 From 2009 until 2016, the rent of the Metro was not increased
 isliye cameti do charnon main metro ke kiraye ko badhaane kii sifarish karti he
 This will increase the rent by 51 percent in the first phase and 27 percent in the second phase
 kiraaya nirdhaaran samiti ne apni report main ye bhi likhaa he ki badha hua kiraaya metro ke musafir vahan kar sakane main sakasham hai
 In support of this, the Metro's Fair Fixation Committee has also given some arguments and presented facts
 cameti ne report main likhaa, ye paaya gaya ki 2009 se 2016 ke bich audyogic dainik bhatta 95 fisadi tak bad gaya he
 The daily allowance of central employees has also increased by 103 per cent
 cameti ke mutabik anskild, semi skild or skild mazdooron kii mazdooree bhi 143, 158 or 166 fisadi tak bad gai he
 The committee's report also mentions that the Delhi government has increased the minimum wage by fifty percent and the central government has increased the minimum wage by 43 percent
 in tathyon ke aadhaar par cameti ne ye nishkarsh nikaala ki mazdooree se lekar sarkari karmchaariyon kii tankhwaah bad gai he or isliye wo metro kaa badha hua kiraaya de sakate hai
 The fare fixation committee cited the example of DTC behind the increase in rent of national and international organizations
 jisamen kaha gaya he ki kiraaya nahin badhaane kii vajah se ditisi kii aarthik haalat patali ho gai or ditisi sarkaar ke liye ek dendaree ban gai
 Not only this, the International Committee gave the example of Washington Metro
 jisamen saalon tak kiraaya nahin badhaane kii vajah se washington metro ko band kar diya gaya tha
 The committee has said that it will not be good for the health of DMRC if the Delhi Metro fare is not increased

 What they (saints) will get from them? piem modi ne kaha, 'jab maine pramukh swami se yah kaha to vah bole, nahin, santon ko saamaajik vaastaviktaa ke bare main pataa hona chahie, kyonki unhen sahi disha main samaaj ke liye kaam karnaa he
 The Prime Minister also recalled Yogiji Maharaj, who brought the prominent Swami into the Swaminarayan Panth and said that Swami set an example of what a disciple should be like

 Former Team India captain Kapil Dev said that Sachin Tendulkar did not know how to score a double-triple century or 400 although he had the ability to touch these heights but he was stuck in the Mumbai School of Cricket
 kapil ne kaha, mujhe galat mat samajhie lekin meraa maananaa he kischinaney apni pratibha ke saath nyaay nahin kiya
 i have always believed that what he did, he could have done more
 unhone kaha, vah bombai cricket se chipka rahaa
 He should have spent more time with Vivian Richards than with the clean Bombay playing players
 
 
 
 The captain, who won the 1983 World Cup to Sachin India, would have been a better cricketer, "sachin was a better player but he only knew how to score a century
" use nahin pataa tha ki dohare, tihare shatak yaa 400 ran kaise banaate hai
 Kapil said that he would have advised Sachin to play like Virender Sehwag
 unhone kaha, sachin main kshamta thi
 He was technically strong but i think he just used to get a century
 richards kii tarah vah beraham nahin tha balkiperfect cricketertha
 If i could spend more time with him, i would definitely ask him to play like Sehwag
 tum kahin behatar cricketer banoge

 vah tej gendbaajon or spin kaa bakhubi saamana karata tha or gend ko bhaanpane kii uski kshamta gajab kii thi
 He was a brilliant player and he was terrorized by the bowlers in the nineties

 '100 century is the hallmark of Sachin's talent' Fast bowler Wasim Akram regretted that he did not get a chance to play much against Tendulkar
 unhone kaha, vakaar younus or mujhe yah malaal rahegaa ki ham kareeb 10 saal tak tendulkar ke khilaaf test nahin khel sake
 "we played against him when he made his Test debut in 1989," he said
 vah us samay 16 saal kaa tha
 We played the Test against Sachin in 1999
 vah sarvshereshth tha or 100 antarrashtriya shatak uski pratibha kii baangi dete hai
 Batham said, i think Viv Richards was the best player
 unase behatar koi nahin tha
 When i started, it was Richards and Sunil Gavaskar

 mukhyamantri karyaalay kaa aarope he ki buudhvaar kii shaam ko up-rajyapal daftar se mukhyamantri ke daftar bheji gai file kii prati pehle se hi netaa vipaksh vijendra gupta tak pahunch gai
 On Thursday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal sent a letter to Lt Governor Anil Baijal asking that the file sent from Lt Governor's office to Chief Minister's office was received by Chief Minister's office late in the evening on Wednesday
 jabaki netaa vipaksh vijendra gupta ne media ko die gaye bayaan main yah pehle hi kah diya ki up-rajyapal ne mukhyamantri karyaalay ko file lautaa di he
