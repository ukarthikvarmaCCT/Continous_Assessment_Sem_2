 This worry inspired 42-year-old Vedkrishna Jhunjhunwala to try something new
 veda ne faijabad-azamgarh sadak par padane vaale darshananagar main maujuud apane kaagaj ke kaarkaane main videsh se mahangi mashine mangakar lagaayee
 These machines shaped the sugarcane pulp into plates
 ek din main ganne kii lugdi se 8 se 10 lakh platen banane lageen jo itani desh main kahin nahin banatin
 The Vedas say, "eat on our plates
" iske baad inhen jameen main gaad dijie
 These will not only protect your health, but will also increase fertility of the land by turning it into compost in no time
 '' faijabad jaise chote shahar ke ek pichde-se kasbe darshananagar main 80 acre jameen par faile ek parisar ke bheetar teen kaagaj ke kaarkaane, ganne kii khoi se lugdi banane vaali teen mashine, do power plant, chemical recovery unit, andey kii trey banane kaa plant, ganne kii lugdi se bartan banane kaa kaarkaana samet ek darjan se adhik alag-alag factory ke maujuud hone kii misaal desh main duusari nahin he
 The Jhunjhunwala family in Faizabad is known for the paper business
 haalanki shuruyaat main veda ke dada vishnudayal jhunjhunwaala ne chini mil ke jariye kaarobaari duniya main kadam rakhaa
 He along with industrialist Kamalapati Singhania set up a sugar mill in Kanpur in the 1930s
 vah 'kanvarjan unit' thi, jisamen gud se chini banaai jaati thi
 Faizabad and its surrounding area was famous for sugarcane cultivation
 iske liye yahaan ke masauda ilaake main vishnudayal ne khud kii ek chini mil shuru kii
 Gradually the business started growing and Vishnudayal started three more sugar mills
 vishnudayal ke chah bete the jinamein veda ke pita krishna kumaar jhunjhunwaala sabase chote the
 Krishnakumar looked after the work of the factory to build the draft sugar mill
 1976 main vishnudayal ke parivaar main bantwaaraa ho gaya
 Nothing special came to Krishna Kumar
 unhone kheti main bhi haath aajamaaya lekin kaamyaab nahin hue
 Finally in 1981, Krishna Kumar formed a company named 'yash Papers Private Limited' in the name of his younger son Yash
 iske saath hi unhone ek karod ru
 Started a small paper making factory at Darshannagar, on the banks of faizabad-azamgarh road, where five tons of paper were made daily
 us vakt lottery kaa chalan tha
 In this factory, lottery ticket paper was 'recycled' and made from it
 dhire-dhire is kaarobaar ne teji pakadi
 Four years later in 1985, Krishna Kumar also started a paper making factory in Darshannagar with sugarcane pulp
 iske baad 1991 main ek or paper mil lagaai
 The paper factory in Darshannagar started gaining fame all over the country
 yahaan 30 se 35 ton kaagaj roj banane laga
 As the paper business was growing, electricity consumption was also increasing in the same proportion
 krishna kumaar 30 se 35 lakh ru
 Were spending the month only on electricity
 1997 main unhone ek krantikari nirnay liya
 Boilers installed in a paper factory were run with rice bran
 krishna kumaar ne chaaval kii bhusi se chalane vaala dhai megawatt kshamta vaala power plant bhi kaagaj ke kaarkaane ke saath laga liya
 Yash Papers became the first company in North India to set up its own power plant
 yah anokhaa power plant 'extrection condencing technology par aadhaarit he, jisamen ek hi bhaap kaa prayog tarabine chalaane or factory main banane vaale kaagaj ko garam karne main kiya jaataa he
 When the power plant started operating at full capacity, Krishna Kumar shut down all the external power connections of the factories in 1999
 us samay krishna kumaar ke bade bete veda jhunjhunwaala uniwarsity of north landan main pard rahe the
 From the university, Veda did courses in sports management and political economics
 1994 main open heart surgery ke chalate krishna kumaar kuch biimaar rahane lage the
 The trend in business was also continuously decreasing
 krishna kumaar ke bete bhi apane pushtaini kaarobaar ko sanbhaalane main ruchi nahin dikhaa rahe the
 When the eldest son Veda wanted to go for adventure sports, the younger son Yash was not ready to leave the job of 'hospitality Sector'
 kuch samay tak krishnakumar ne apane kaarobaar ke liye kharidaar dhundha lekin koi nahin mila
 Seeing the condition of his father, finally Ved Jhunjhunwala agreed to take over the business in 1997 and after two years he took the entire work on his shoulders
 iske baad se kaagaj ke kaarobaar main prayogon or nai takanic ke samavesh kaa daur shuru hua
 The quality of the paper was enhanced by improving the methods of cooking, pulp making
 veda bataate hai, ''1990 ke dashak ke antim varshon main yash papers kaagaj kaa jaraa bhi niryaat nahin karata tha
 We looked into it
 kuch hi varshon main ham 20 pratishat se adhik niryaat karne lage
 "today, Yash Papers' paper is exported to many countries of the world along with Europe, America
 yash papers 2003 tak 30 karod ru
 The company was formed
 yahaan se yash papers ke vistaar kii ruparekha bani
 Yash Papers, after acquiring Kaveri Papers, a South Indian company, installed some of its machines at its factory in Darshanagar
 veda bataate hai, ''ham khaane or pharmaceutical kshetra main prayog hone vaala kaagaj banane ke liye ek alag plant lagaana chaah rahe the, jiske liye kam se kam 80 karod ru
 Was needed
 '' 2005 main bainkon se rin or bombai stock exange main yash papers ke public ishyu laakar veda ne dhan jutaya
 After five years of ups and downs, stability came in 2010 and Yash Papers started making paper used in surgical gloves, bandaids besides brands like mcdonald's, Cafe Coffee Day, Pizzatta
 is tarah aise alag-alag kism ke kaagaj banane vaali yash papers uttar bharat kii pehali company ban gai
 Even so, the Vedas were not satisfied
 ve bataate hai, ''ham log jo 'biodegradebal' (swaabhaavik rup se galane vaala) kaagaj companiyon ko bech rahe the, us par ve plastic yaa anya rasayan lagaakar kaagaj kaa mul charitra khatm kar de rahi thim
 We thought of creating a product that would not cause adverse effects on the earth
 '' pichley varsh ganne kii lugdi se bartan banane ke liye veda ne china kii 'jeeyo tegrity' company se atyaadhunik mashine kharidin
 These utensils made from sugarcane pulp were launched as 'chamya brand'
 veda bataate hai, ''agle varsh tak ham mashroom kaa upyog karke aisa utpaada bananaa shuru kar denge jo frij, tivi jaise bade saamaan ko pack karne main prayog hone vaale mote thermokol kaa surakshit vikalp hoga
 We will also make elastic and strong paper that can replace polybags

 com / rdza7eqxqg— ANI (@ani)july 1, 2019 The new session has started, but till now the books of Delhi Government and MCD have been provided free books to children studying in schools
 shiksha ke adhikaar ke kanoon ke tahat rajya sarkaar ko 8veen kaksha tak ke bacchon ko muft kitaaben deni hoti hai
 Poor children without books are forced to go to school with empty bags
 lagbhag 16 lakh bachche dilli sarkaar or emsidi kii skulon main padhate hai
 Seven-year-old Twinkle was found attending school with her father
 tvinkal dilli sarkaar ke sarvoday vidhyalay main duusari kaksha paas karke teesri kaksha main gai hai lekin tvinkal ke baste main puraani kaksha kii hi kitaaben hai kyonki ab tak unhen sarkaar se muft kitaaben nahin mili hai
 Twinkle's father Vishnu, who cooks at weddings, does not have enough money to buy books for his daughter
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki dilli sarkaar or emsidi donon hi hoicourt main bacchon ko pehali april ko kitaaben dene kii baat kah chuke hai
 Senior Advocate Ashok Aggarwal states that "the High Court of Delhi Government and all the three corporations have stated that on the first date of April they will give books to the children, but this did not happen
" " In this year's budget of Delhi Government, 24% of the total budget is for education, which is the highest in the entire budget
 dilli sarkaar kaa kahana he ki "ham maan rahe hai ki thodi der ho rahi he lekin ham apane bade do zone uttar or uttar purv main kitaaben de chuke hai or 15 april tak sabhi skulon main kitabe de di jaaengi
 " emsidi ke skulon kii bhi halaat aisi hi he
 The Delhi government is constantly asking people through radio and newspapers to send their children to Delhi government schools, but when cases like non-availability of books arise, the entire campaign of the state government is questioned somewhere

 katl maasoom chaatr pradhyumna kaa hua tha, lekin cese kaa murder gudgaanv police ne kar diya
 The pictures in CCTV are the same, the eyewitness is the same, the chance-e-crime incident but according to the Gurgaon Police, the killer bus conductor turned out to be Ashok
 jabaki inhen tamaam sabooton ko parakhane ke baad sibiai ne kaatil ke taur par kisi or ko pesh kiya
 Now the question arises as to where was the mistake from the Gurgaon Police or what evidence the CBI has found which has led to a new murderer
 sibiai ne badal di police kii theoricase vahi
 Same evidence for that case
 uske gavaah bhi vahi
 Then how did the result reverse? pradhyumna murder kesamen police jise open and shat cese maan rahi thi, uski theory achaanak do maheene baad thas kaise pad gai
 Then what was it that showed the CBI but the Gurgaon police could not see
 yaa dekhakar usne andekha kar diya tha
 Now, according to the CBI, the Gurgaon Police investigation showed him a student in CCTV but his needle was fixed on the conductor
 bas yaheen usase galati ho rahi thi
 CBI started investigation with CCTV footage
 However, like the police, CBI started the investigation in this case only with CCTV footage
 is footage main maasoom pradhyumna ke saath ek or ladkaa bhi bathroom kii taraf jaataa or aata dikh rahaa tha
 While Pradyuman's sister was seen going to the other side of the bathroom
 lekin ye sisitivi footage saaf nahin tha, cheharaa pahchaanana mushkil ho rahaa tha
 In such a situation, CBI enlisted the help of forensic experts
 footage kii jaanch kar saamne or peeche se dekh kar exparts ne ye conform kar diya ki bathroom main jane or nikalne vaala ladkaa ek hi he, jabaki doosraa ladkaa pradhyumna he
 It was the accused who had given a statement against Ashok, the CBI came to know from the uniform that the student belongs to class 11
 iske baad skool main 11veen class main padhane vaale sabhi chaatro se poochtacha kii gai
 Then it was learned that a boy of the same class was an eyewitness in this case and he had also given a statement against the bus conductor in front of the magistrate in 164
 sibiai ne sara focus aaropee chaatr par tikaaya or usase baatcheet main sibiai ko shaq pukhta hone laga
 Because the student was questioned about four or five times
 lekin ajeeb baat ye thi ki har baar poochtacha main uskaa bayaan badal rahaa tha
 The accused student therefore murdered, now the question was motive
 yani ladke ne pradhyumna kaaqatlakia kyon? sibiai se jude sutron ke mutabik aaropee chaatr padhai main kamjor he or us din skool main hone vaale agzaam or parents teachers meeting se ghabara rahaa tha
 He wanted to postpone them and that's why he decided to kill Pradyuman
 us rose pradhyumna kii jagah koi doosraa baccha bhi uskaa shikaar ho saktaa tha
 According to the CBI, the accused boy watched the adult film on his mobile phone after going to the bathroom and tried to plead with Pradyuman
 lekin pradhyumna ke virodh karne par use maar daalaa
 But the CBI did not want to detain this 11th student until he was completely mutilated
 badal gaya aaropee chaatr kaa bartaawalihaaza sabase pehle skool main uske doston se baat kii gai
 An attempt was made to find out whether the student's behavior had changed after Pradyman's murder
 poochtacha main sirf us chaatr ke doston ne hi nahin balki khud uske maa baap ne is baad tasdik kii chaatr ke bartaav main tabdili ai
 According to the CBI, the boy had also told his friends before the murder that they should not prepare for the exam, because the school is going to be discharged
 ab uske parijan kah rahe hai ki uskaa pradyumn ke murder se koi matlab nahin balki use fansaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The accused student is now on remand, however, the other aspect of the case is that the accused student is among the influential people in the area and perhaps his family had come to know from his son's behavior that there was something wrong in the case
 aaropee chaatr ke khilaaf dhara 302 ke tahat pradhyumna kii hatya kaa maamla darj kar liya gaya
 After which the accused student was presented before the Juvenile Justice Court by the CBI
 jahaan se court ne use remand par bhej diya gaya he

 Varuthini Ekadashi 2019: varuthini ekadshi kii vrath puja karne se bhagwaan vishnu kaa aashirwad miltaa he
 This fast is also called a fasting fortune
 manyata he ki varuthini ekadshi main vrath karne se bachche dderghaayu hote hai, unhen kisi prakaar kii samasya nahin hoti he
 Stay safe from accident
 isamen vishnu bhagwaan kii vrath-puja kii jaati he
 It is believed that Lord Vishnu gives a lot of happiness by taking a fast of Varuthini Ekadashi
 baishakh maas main 2 ekadshi aati hai, jisamen krishna paksh kii ekadshi ko varuthini ekadshi kehete hai
 It is also believed that by observing a fast on Varuthini Ekadashi, there is virtue in this world with this world
 is baar varuthini ekadshi vrath mangalvaar 30 april 2019 ko he
 How to worship Varuthini Ekadashi - Lord Vishnu is worshiped in this
 - subah gangaajal daalkar snaan karen or safed vastra pahanen
 - Establish a vase
 - kalash ke upar aam ke pallav, nariyal, laal chunari baandhakar rakhen
 - Burn incense, lamps and offer Barfi, Melon and Mango and chant Om Namo Bhagwate Vasudevaya
 - yah vrath agle din puja paath karke hi kholaa jaataa he or tab tak sirf falahar hi karte hai
 What is the story of Varuthini Ekadashi - It is said that years ago there used to be a king on the banks of river Narmada
 is raja kaa naam maanadhaata tha
 The king was very kind, religious and benevolent and believed in God very much
 wo jangal main baithkar ghanto bhagwaan vishnu ko paane ke liye unki tapasya karata tha
 One day he became very absorbed in penance, then a wild bear arrived and he took the king by the mouth and took him to the forest
 lekin raja ne jaraa bhi krodh nahin kiya or unhone apni tapasya bhi nahin todi
 Rather i prayed to Lord Vishnu, 'O God, save me from this crisis
 ' antat bhagwaan vishnu vahaan prakat ho gaye
 After this, Lord Vishnu appeared and killed the bear with his chakra
 bhaaluu ne raja kaa pair jakhmi kar diya tha or raja bahut dukhi tha

 ye bhi varshon se lataka padaa vishay tha, isko bhi puraa kiya, shilanyas kiya, or 20 saal se jo kaam nahin hua tha wo 20 maheenon main puraa karne kaa sankalp kiya
 And at the same time, a thought has come to my mind and we are engaged, even today there are some families in our country who are forced to carry the dirt on the head
 kya hamen shobhaa detaa he ki aaj bhi hamaare desh main kuch pariwaron ko sar par mailaa dhonaa pade? maine sarkaar main bade aagrah se kaha he ki baba sahib ambedkar ji ke punya samaran karte hue 125 veen jainti ke varsh main, ham is kalank se mukti paaen
 Now in our country, any poor has to carry scum on the head, we will not bear this situation
 samaaj kaa bhi saath chaiye
 The government should also fulfill its obligation
 mujhe janata kaa bhi sahyog chaiye, is kaam ko hamen karnaa he
 Baba Saheb Ambedkar used to say to be educated throughout his life
 aaj bhi hamaare kai dalit, peedit, shoshit, vanchit samaaj main, khaas karke betiyon main, shiksha abhi pahaunchi nahin he
 On the occasion of the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, let us also resolve
 hamaare gaanv main, nagar main, mohalle main garib se garib kii beti yaa betaa, anpadh na rahe
 If the government does its duty, if the society gets along with it, then we definitely feel satisfaction
 mujhe ek anand kii baat share karne kaa man karata he or ek pidaa bhi bataane kaa man karata he
 i feel proud that two daughters of India brightened the name of the country
 ek beti saina nehwal badminton main duniya main number ek bani, or duusari beti sania mirza tennis dubles main duniya main number ek bani
 Congratulations to both, and also to all the daughters of the country
 garv hota he apano ke purusharth or parakram ko lekar ke
 But sometimes we also lose temper
 jab cricket kaa world cap chal rahaa tha or semi-final main ham australia se haar gaye, kuch logon ne hamaare khilaadiyon ke liye jis prakaar ke shabdon kaa prayog kiya, jo vyavhaar kiya, mere deshavaasiyo, ye acha nahin he
 What should be the game in which there is no defeat, Jai and defeat are part of life
 agar hamaare desh ke khilaadi kabhi haar gaye hai to sankat kii ghadi main unka hausala buland karnaa chaiye
 An atmosphere should be created to create their new faith
 mujhe vishwaas he aage se ham paraajay se bhi seekhenge or desh ke sammaan ke saath jo baaten judi hui hai, usamen pal bhar main hi santulan kho karke, kriya-pratikriya main nahin ulajh jaayenge
 And I'm worried sometimes
 main jab kabhi dekhtaa hum ki kahin aksmaat ho gaya, to bheed ikatthi hoti he or gaadi ko jala detii he
 And we also see these things on TV
 accident nahin hona chaiye
 The government should also make every effort
 lekin mere deshavaasiyo bataaiye ki is prakaar se gussa prakat karke ham trek ko jala den, gaadi ko jala den
 
 
 
 mara hua to waapas aata nahin he
 Can we not allow the law to work as a law by keeping our feelings of mind balanced? Should think khayr, aaj meraa man in ghatnaon ke kaaran bada vyathit he, khaas karke prakritik aapadaaon ke kaaran, lekin iske bich bhi dhairya ke saath, aatmavishvaas ke saath desh ko bhi aage le jaayenge, is desh kaa koi bhi vyakti
 
 
 Be it Dalit, victim, exploited, deprived, tribal, village, poor, farmer, small businessman, anyone, on the path of welfare of everyone, we will keep moving forward with determination
 vidhyaarthiyon kii parikshaayen purna hui hai, khaas kar ke 10 veen or 12 veen ke vidhyaarthiyon ne chuttee manaane ke kaarykram banaae honge, meri aap sabko shubhakamanaayen hai
 Your vacation is very good, you have an opportunity to learn something new in life, to learn new, and you have worked hard throughout the year, then it is my wish to spend some moments with family with enthusiasm and enthusiasm
 aap sabko meraa namaskara
 The comments dhanyavad
 My dear countrymen, namaskara, Today, i was not feeling like talking about my mind
 boj anubhav kar rahaa hum, kuch vyathit sa man he
 When i was talking to you last month, there were reports of hailstorms, unseasonal rains, devastation of farmers
 abhi kuch din pehle bihar main achaanak tej hawa chali
 Many people were killed
 kaaphi kuch nuksaan hua
 And the terrible earthquake on Saturday has shaken the whole world
 aisa lagata he maano prakritik aapadaa kaa silsilaa chal padaa he
 Catastrophic earthquake disaster in Nepal
 hindustan main bhi bukamp ne alag-alag rajyon main kai logon kii jaan lee he
 Has also done property damage
 lekin nepal kaa nuksaan bahut bhayankar he
 i have closely observed the 2001, 26 January, Kutch earthquake
 ye aapadaa kitni bhayanak hoti he, uski main kalpana bhalee-bhaanti kar saktaa hum
 i can imagine what would have passed on Nepal, what would have passed on those families
 lekin mere pyaare nepal ke bhaaiyo-bahano, hindustan aapke dukh main aapke saath he
 For immediate help, even in the corner of the country where there is trouble, and in Nepal, we have started to provide help
 sabase pehla kaam he rescue oparation, logon ko bachaana
 Some people still buried under the debris will be alive, they have to be saved
 export logon kii team bheji he, saath main, is kaam ke liye jinako vishesh rup se train kiya gaya he aise snifar dogs ko bhi bheja gaya he
 Sniffer dogs are able to find that there is a person alive under the debris
 koshish hamaari puri rahegi adhiktam logon ko jinda bachaaen
 Relief work is also to be carried out after the rescue operation
 rihabilitation kaa kaam bhi to bahut lambaa chalegaa
 But humanity has its own strengths
 sava-sau karod desh vaasiyon ke liye nepal apana he
 The sorrow of those people is also our sorrow
 bharat puri koshish karegaa is aapadaa ke samay har nepali ke aansu bhi ponchhenge, unka haath bhi pakadenge, unako saath bhi denge
 Recently in Yemen, thousands of our Indian siblings were stranded
 yuddh kii bhayankar vibheeshikaa ke bich, bam bandook ke tanaav ke bich, golabari ke bich bharatiyon ko nikaalnaa, jivit nikaalnaa, ek bahut bada kathin kaam tha
 But we were able to
 itnaa hi nahin, ek saptaah kii umr kii ek bacchee ko jab bachaa karke laaye to aisa lag rahaa tha ki aakhir maanavtaa kii bhi kitni badi takat hoti he
 If the rain of a bomb and the gun goes on, the shadow of death, and a week old child can save his life, then a mind is satisfied
 main pichley dinon videsh main jahaan bhi gaya, ek baat ke liye bahut badhaaiyaan mili, or wo tha yaman main hamane duniya ke kareeb 48 deshon ke nagarikon ko bachaaya tha
 Whether it is America, u
 ke
 Ho, France Ho, Russia Ho, Germany Ho, Japan Ho, we helped every citizen
 or uske kaaran duniya main bharat kaa ye “seva parmo dharmah”, isaki anubhuti vishwa ne kii he
 Our foreign ministry, our air force, our navy have done this work with so much patience, with so much responsibility, it will have an indelible mark in the world, i believe so in the days to come
 or mujhe khushi he ki koi bhi nuksaan ke bina, sab log bachakar ke baahar aaye
 Anyway, a virtue of India, the rites of India are very old
 abhi main jab france gaya tha to france main, main pratham vishwa yuddh ke ek smarak par gaya tha
 There was a reason for this, that it is the century of World War I, but at the same time it is the centenary year of India's might
 It is the year of the sacrificial death of India's heroes and how "seva paramo-dharma:" to illustrate this ideal
 Our country has been doing this, this year of its century, i am saying that World War i went on in 1914 and till 1918 and very few people will know that about 1
5 million Indian soldiers have fought this war
 They had lost their lives in India and the soldiers of India were not dying for themselves
 Hindustan did not have to occupy any country, nor Hindustan had to take anyone's land but Indians had shown a wonderful valor
 Very few people It will be known that about 74 thousand of our soldiers had martyred in this First World War, it is also a matter of pride that about 9 thousand 2 hundred of our soldiers were honored with Gallantry Award
 Was arranged
 Not only that, unke sammaan main france ne vahaan ek smarak banaaya he
 i went there to bow down, pay tribute to the might of our ancestors
 ye sari ghatnayen ham dekhen to ham duniya ko kah sakate hai ki ye desh aisa he jo duniya kii shanti ke liye, duniya ke sukh ke liye, vishwa ke kalyaan ke liye sochataa he
 He does something and, if needed, also betrays his life
 united neshns main bhi piskiping force main sarvaadhik yogadan dene waalon main bharat kaa bhi naam pratham pankti main he
 This is a matter of pride for us
 pichley dinon do mahatvapurn kaam karne kaa mujhe avasar mila
 We are celebrating the year of 125th birth anniversary of Pujya Baba Saheb Ambedkar
 kai varshon se mumbai main unke smarak banane kaa jameen kaa vivaad chal rahaa tha
 i am satisfied today that the Government of India has decided to give that land for the memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar
 usee prakaar se dilli main baba sahib ambedkar ke naam se ek international centre bane, puraa vishwa is manishi ko jane, unke vichaaron ko jane, unke kaam ko jane
 This too was a subject hanging for years, completed it, laid the foundation stone, and resolved to complete the work which had not been done for 20 years in 20 months
 or saath-saath mere man main ek vichaar bhi aayaa he or ham lage hai, aaj bhi hamaare desh main kuch parivaar hai jinako sar pe mailaa dhone ke liye majaboor hona padataa he
 Does it suit us that even today some families in our country have to carry scum on the head? i have said with great urge in the government that in the year of 125th birth anniversary remembering the virtue of Babasaheb Ambedkar, we can get rid of this stigma
 ab hamaare desh main kisi garib ko sar par mailaa dhonaa pade, ye paristhati ham sahan nahin karenge
 Society should also be supported
 sarkaar ne bhi apana daayitv nibhaana chaiye
 i also need the support of the public, we have to do this work
 baba sahib ambedkar jivan bhar shikshit bano ye kehete rahete the
 Even today, education has not yet reached many of our Dalit, oppressed, exploited, deprived society, especially among daughters
 baba sahib ambedkar ke 125 veen jainti ke parv par, ham bhi sankalp karen
 In our village, in the city, in the locality, the daughter or son of the poorest of the poor should not remain illiterate
 sarkaar apana karttavya kare, samaaj kaa usamen saath mili to ham zarur santosh kii anubhuti karte hai
 i feel like sharing a pleasure and an agony
 mujhe is baat kaa garv hota he ki bharat kii do betiyon ne desh ke naam ko raushan kiya
 One daughter Saina Nehwal became number one in the world in badminton, and the other daughter Sania Mirza became number one in the world in tennis doubles
 donon ko badhai, or desh kii sari betiyon ko bhi badhai
 Proud of their efforts and might
 lekin kabhi-kabhi ham bhi aapa kho baithte hai
 When the cricket World Cup was going on and we lost to Australia in the semi-finals, the kind words that some people used for our players, which behaved, my countrymen, is not good
 aisa kaisaa khel ho jisamen kabhi paraajay hi na ho are jai or paraajay to jindagi ke hisse hote hai
 If the players of our country have ever lost, they should be encouraged in times of crisis
 unka nayaa vishwaas paidaa karne kaa maahaul bananaa chaiye
 i am confident that from the future we will learn from the defeat and will not get entangled in the action and reaction in a moment by losing balance in the things which are associated with the honor of the country
 or mujhe kabhi-kabhi chintaa ho rahi he
 Whenever i see that something happens suddenly, a crowd gathers and burns the car
 or ham tivi par in chizon ko dekhte bhi hai
 Should not be an accident sarkaar ne bhi har prakaar kii koshish kerani chaiye
 But tell my countrymen that by expressing anger in this way, we burn the truck, burn the car
 
 
 
 Dead does not come back kya ham apane man ke bhaavon ko santulit rakhke kanoon ko kanoon kaa kaam nahin karne de sakate hai? sochna chaiye
 Well, today my mind is very distressed due to these incidents, especially due to natural calamities, but in the midst of it, with patience, with confidence, you will also take the country forward, any person of this country
 
 
 dalit ho, peedit ho, shoshit ho, vanchit ho, adivasee ho, gaanv kaa ho, garib ho, kisaan ho, chota vyapaaree ho, koi bhi ho, har ek ke kalyaan ke maarg par, ham sankalp ke saath aage badhate rahenge
 Students' examinations have been completed, especially students of 10th and 12th must have made holiday programs, i wish you all the best
 aapkaa vekeshan bahut hi acha rahe, jivan main kuch nayaa seekhney kaa, nayaa jaanane kaa avasar mili, or saal bhar aapane mehnat kii he to kuch pal parivaar ke saath umang or utsaah ke saath beete yahi meri shubhakamana he
 My greetings to all of you

 My greetings to all of you
 tippaniyan Thank you
 man kii baat karne kaa man nahin ho rahaa tha aaj
 Feeling burdened, a bit distressed
 pichley maheene jab baat kar rahaa tha aapse, to ole girane kii khabaren, bemausami barsaat, kisaanon kii tabaahi
 Just a few days ago, there was a sudden strong wind in Bihar
 kaaphi log maare gaye
 Much damage was done
 or shanivaar ko bhayankar bukamp ne puure vishwa ko hilaa diya he
 It seems as if the natural disaster has started
 nepal main bhayankar bukamp kii aapadaa
 In India too, earthquake has killed many people in different states
 sampatti kaa bhi nuksaan kiya he
 But Nepal's loss is terrible
 maine 2001, 26 janvari, kuccha ke bukamp ko nikat se dekha he
 i can well imagine how terrible this disaster is
 nepal par kya bitati hogi, un pariwaron par kya bitati hogi, uski main kalpana kar saktaa hum
 But my dear brothers and sisters of Nepal, Hindustan is with you in your grief
 tatkaal madad ke liye chaahe hindustan ke jis kone main musiibat aayi he vahaan bhi, or nepal main bhi sahay pahunchaana prarambh kar diya he
 The first task is rescue operation, to save people
 abhi bhi malbe main dabe hue kuch log jivit honge, unako jinda nikaalnaa hai
 Experts have sent teams of people, along with sniffer dogs who have been specially trained for this task
 snifer dogs dhund pate hai ki kahin malbe ke neeche koi insaan jinda ho
 It will be our endeavor to save the maximum number of lives
 rescue oparation ke baad relif kaa kaam bhi chalaanaa he
 Rehabilitation work will also go a long way
 lekin maanavtaa kii apni ek takat hoti he
 Nepal is its own for 125 crore people
 un logon kaa dukh bhi hamaara dukh he
 India will try its best to wipe the tears of every Nepali at the time of this disaster, will also hold their hand, will also support them
 pichley dinon yaman main, hamaare hajaaron bhartiya bhai bahan fanse hue the
 In the midst of the terrible horrors of war, amidst the tension of a bomb shotgun, evacuating the Indians, firing them alive, was a very difficult task
 lekin ham kar paae
 Not only this, when it was saved by bringing a girl of one week of age, it seemed that humanity too has great power
 bam-bandook kii varsha chalati ho, maut kaa saaya ho, or ek saptaah kii bacchee apni jindagi bachaa sake tab ek man ko santosh hota he
 Wherever i went abroad in the past, many congratulations were received for one thing, and it was in Yemen that we rescued citizens of about 48 countries of the world
 chaahe america ho, you
 K
 ho, france ho, rashia ho, germany ho, japan ho, har desh ke naagarik ko hamane madad kii thi
 And because of this, this "seva Parmo Dharma" of India in the world has been realized by the world
 hamaara videsh mantralay, hamaari vaayu sena, hamaari nausena itane dhairya ke saath, itani jimmevary ke saath, is kaam ko kiya he, duniya main isaki amit chhap rahegi aane vaale dinon main, aisa main vishwaas karata hum
 And i am glad that everybody came out without any loss
 vaise bhi bharat kaa ek gun, bharat ke sanskaar bahut puraane hai
 Just when i went to France, in France, i went to a World War i memorial
 uskaa ek kaaran bhi tha, ki pratham vishwa yuddh kii shatabdi to he, lekin saath-saath bharat kii parakram kaa bhi wo shatabdi varsh haii bharat ke veeron kii balidani kii shatabdi kaa varsh he or “seva parmo-dharmah” is adarsh ko kaise charitaarth karata rahaa hamaara desh , uski bhi shatabdi kaa yah varsh he, main yah isliye kah rahaa hum ki 1914 main or 1918 tak pratham vishwa yuddh chalaa or bahut kam logon ko maaloom hoga kareeb-kareeb 15 lakh bhartiya sainikon ne is yuddh main apni jaan kii baaji laga di thi or bharat ke jawan apane liye nahin mar rahe thei hindustan ko, kisi desh ko kabja nahin karnaa tha, na hindustan ko kisi kii jameen leni thi lekin bharatiyon ne ek adbhut parakram karke dikhaaya thai bahut kam logon ko maaloom hoga is pratham vishwa yuddh main hamaare kareeb-kareeb 74 hajaar javaanon ne shahadat kii thi, ye bhi garv kii baat he ki is par kareeb 9 hajaar 2 sau hamaare sainikon ko galentry award se decorat kiya gaya thai itnaa hi nahin, 11 aise parakramee log the jinako sarvshereshth sammaan victoria cross mila thai khaskar ki france main vishwa yuddh ke darmiyaan march 1915 main kareeb 4 hajaar 7 sau hamaare hindustaniyon ne balidaan diya tha
 France has built a memorial in his honor
 main vahaan naman karne gaya tha, hamaare purvajon ke parakram ke prati shradhdha vyakt karne gaya tha
 If we see all these events, then we can say to the world that this country is one which thinks for the peace of the world, for the happiness of the world, for the welfare of the world
 kuch na kuch karata he or zarurat pade to jaan kii baazi bhi laga detaa he
 In the United Nations too, India has also been named in the first line of the contribution of Peacekeeping Force
 yahi to ham logon ke liye garv kii baat he
 Recently, i had the opportunity to do two important things
 ham poojya baba sahib ambedkar kii 125 veen jainti kaa varsh manaa rahe hai
 For many years, there was a dispute of land in Mumbai to build his memorial
 mujhe aaj is baat kaa santosh he ki bharat sarkaar ne wo jameen baba sahib ambedkar ke smarak banane ke liye dene kaa nirnay kar liya
 Similarly, in Delhi, an international center should be established in the name of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the whole world should know this Manishi, know his thoughts, know his work
 ye bhi varshon se lataka padaa vishay tha, isko bhi puraa kiya, shilanyas kiya, or 20 saal se jo kaam nahin hua tha wo 20 maheenon main puraa karne kaa sankalp kiya
 And at the same time, a thought has come to my mind and we are engaged, even today there are some families in our country who are forced to carry the dirt on the head
 kya hamen shobhaa detaa he ki aaj bhi hamaare desh main kuch pariwaron ko sar par mailaa dhonaa pade? maine sarkaar main bade aagrah se kaha he ki baba sahib ambedkar ji ke punya samaran karte hue 125 veen jainti ke varsh main, ham is kalank se mukti paaen
 Now in our country, any poor has to carry scum on the head, we will not bear this situation
 samaaj kaa bhi saath chaiye
 The government should also fulfill its obligation
 mujhe janata kaa bhi sahyog chaiye, is kaam ko hamen karnaa he
 Baba Saheb Ambedkar used to say to be educated throughout his life
 aaj bhi hamaare kai dalit, peedit, shoshit, vanchit samaaj main, khaas karke betiyon main, shiksha abhi pahaunchi nahin he
 On the occasion of the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, let us also resolve
 hamaare gaanv main, nagar main, mohalle main garib se garib kii beti yaa betaa, anpadh na rahe
 If the government does its duty, if the society gets along with it, then we definitely feel satisfaction
 mujhe ek anand kii baat share karne kaa man karata he or ek pidaa bhi bataane kaa man karata he
 i feel proud that two daughters of India brightened the name of the country
 ek beti saina nehwal badminton main duniya main number ek bani, or duusari beti sania mirza tennis dubles main duniya main number ek bani
 Congratulations to both, and also to all the daughters of the country
 garv hota he apano ke purusharth or parakram ko lekar ke
 But sometimes we also lose temper
 jab cricket kaa world cap chal rahaa tha or semi-final main ham australia se haar gaye, kuch logon ne hamaare khilaadiyon ke liye jis prakaar ke shabdon kaa prayog kiya, jo vyavhaar kiya, mere deshavaasiyo, ye acha nahin he
 What should be the game in which there is no defeat, Jai and defeat are part of life
 agar hamaare desh ke khilaadi kabhi haar gaye hai to sankat kii ghadi main unka hausala buland karnaa chaiye
 An atmosphere should be created to create their new faith
 mujhe vishwaas he aage se ham paraajay se bhi seekhenge or desh ke sammaan ke saath jo baaten judi hui hai, usamen pal bhar main hi santulan kho karke, kriya-pratikriya main nahin ulajh jaayenge
 And I'm worried sometimes
 main jab kabhi dekhtaa hum ki kahin aksmaat ho gaya, to bheed ikatthi hoti he or gaadi ko jala detii he
 And we also see these things on TV
 accident nahin hona chaiye
 The government should also make every effort
 lekin mere deshavaasiyo bataaiye ki is prakaar se gussa prakat karke ham trek ko jala den, gaadi ko jala den
 
 
 
 mara hua to waapas aata nahin he
 Can we not allow the law to work as a law by keeping our feelings of mind balanced? Should think khayr, aaj meraa man in ghatnaon ke kaaran bada vyathit he, khaas karke prakritik aapadaaon ke kaaran, lekin iske bich bhi dhairya ke saath, aatmavishvaas ke saath desh ko bhi aage le jaayenge, is desh kaa koi bhi vyakti
 
 
 Be it Dalit, victim, exploited, deprived, tribal, village, poor, farmer, small businessman, anyone, on the path of welfare of everyone, we will keep moving forward with determination
 vidhyaarthiyon kii parikshaayen purna hui hai, khaas kar ke 10 veen or 12 veen ke vidhyaarthiyon ne chuttee manaane ke kaarykram banaae honge, meri aap sabko shubhakamanaayen hai
 Your vacation is very good, you have an opportunity to learn something new in life, to learn new, and you have worked hard throughout the year, then it is my wish to spend some moments with family with enthusiasm and enthusiasm
 aap sabko meraa namaskara

 i have closely observed the 2001, 26 January, Kutch earthquake
 ye aapadaa kitni bhayanak hoti he, uski main kalpana bhalee-bhaanti kar saktaa hum
 i can imagine what would have passed on Nepal, what would have passed on those families
 lekin mere pyaare nepal ke bhaaiyo-bahano, hindustan aapke dukh main aapke saath he
 For immediate help, even in the corner of the country where there is trouble, and in Nepal, we have started to provide help
 sabase pehla kaam he rescue oparation, logon ko bachaana
 Some people still buried under the debris will be alive, they have to be saved
 export logon kii team bheji he, saath main, is kaam ke liye jinako vishesh rup se train kiya gaya he aise snifar dogs ko bhi bheja gaya he
 Sniffer dogs are able to find that there is a person alive under the debris
 koshish hamaari puri rahegi adhiktam logon ko jinda bachaaen
 Relief work is also to be carried out after the rescue operation
 rihabilitation kaa kaam bhi to bahut lambaa chalegaa
 But humanity has its own strengths
 sava-sau karod desh vaasiyon ke liye nepal apana he
 The sorrow of those people is also our sorrow
 bharat puri koshish karegaa is aapadaa ke samay har nepali ke aansu bhi ponchhenge, unka haath bhi pakadenge, unako saath bhi denge
 Recently in Yemen, thousands of our Indian siblings were stranded
 yuddh kii bhayankar vibheeshikaa ke bich, bam bandook ke tanaav ke bich, golabari ke bich bharatiyon ko nikaalnaa, jivit nikaalnaa, ek bahut bada kathin kaam tha
 But we were able to
 itnaa hi nahin, ek saptaah kii umr kii ek bacchee ko jab bachaa karke laaye to aisa lag rahaa tha ki aakhir maanavtaa kii bhi kitni badi takat hoti he
 If the rain of a bomb and the gun goes on, the shadow of death, and a week old child can save his life, then a mind is satisfied
 main pichley dinon videsh main jahaan bhi gaya, ek baat ke liye bahut badhaaiyaan mili, or wo tha yaman main hamane duniya ke kareeb 48 deshon ke nagarikon ko bachaaya tha
 Whether it is America, u
 ke
 Ho, France Ho, Russia Ho, Germany Ho, Japan Ho, we helped every citizen
 or uske kaaran duniya main bharat kaa ye “seva parmo dharmah”, isaki anubhuti vishwa ne kii he
 Our foreign ministry, our air force, our navy have done this work with so much patience, with so much responsibility, it will have an indelible mark in the world, i believe so in the days to come
 or mujhe khushi he ki koi bhi nuksaan ke bina, sab log bachakar ke baahar aaye
 Anyway, a virtue of India, the rites of India are very old
 abhi main jab france gaya tha to france main, main pratham vishwa yuddh ke ek smarak par gaya tha
 There was a reason for this, that it is the century of World War I, but at the same time it is the centenary year of India's might
 It is the year of the sacrificial death of India's heroes and how "seva paramo-dharma:" to illustrate this ideal
 Our country has been doing this, this year of its century, i am saying that World War i went on in 1914 and till 1918 and very few people will know that about 1
5 million Indian soldiers have fought this war
 They had lost their lives in India and the soldiers of India were not dying for themselves
 Hindustan did not have to occupy any country, nor Hindustan had to take anyone's land but Indians had shown a wonderful valor
 Very few people It will be known that about 74 thousand of our soldiers had martyred in this First World War, it is also a matter of pride that about 9 thousand 2 hundred of our soldiers were honored with Gallantry Award
 Was arranged
 Not only that, unke sammaan main france ne vahaan ek smarak banaaya he
 i went there to bow down, pay tribute to the might of our ancestors
 ye sari ghatnayen ham dekhen to ham duniya ko kah sakate hai ki ye desh aisa he jo duniya kii shanti ke liye, duniya ke sukh ke liye, vishwa ke kalyaan ke liye sochataa he
 He does something and, if needed, also betrays his life
 united neshns main bhi piskiping force main sarvaadhik yogadan dene waalon main bharat kaa bhi naam pratham pankti main he
 This is a matter of pride for us
 pichley dinon do mahatvapurn kaam karne kaa mujhe avasar mila
 We are celebrating the year of 125th birth anniversary of Pujya Baba Saheb Ambedkar
 kai varshon se mumbai main unke smarak banane kaa jameen kaa vivaad chal rahaa tha
 i am satisfied today that the Government of India has decided to give that land for the memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar
 usee prakaar se dilli main baba sahib ambedkar ke naam se ek international centre bane, puraa vishwa is manishi ko jane, unke vichaaron ko jane, unke kaam ko jane
 This too was a subject hanging for years, completed it, laid the foundation stone, and resolved to complete the work which had not been done for 20 years in 20 months
 or saath-saath mere man main ek vichaar bhi aayaa he or ham lage hai, aaj bhi hamaare desh main kuch parivaar hai jinako sar pe mailaa dhone ke liye majaboor hona padataa he
 Does it suit us that even today some families in our country have to carry scum on the head? i have said with great urge in the government that in the year of 125th birth anniversary remembering the virtue of Babasaheb Ambedkar, we can get rid of this stigma
 ab hamaare desh main kisi garib ko sar par mailaa dhonaa pade, ye paristhati ham sahan nahin karenge
 Society should also be supported
 sarkaar ne bhi apana daayitv nibhaana chaiye
 i also need the support of the public, we have to do this work
 baba sahib ambedkar jivan bhar shikshit bano ye kehete rahete the
 Even today, education has not yet reached many of our Dalit, oppressed, exploited, deprived society, especially among daughters
 baba sahib ambedkar ke 125 veen jainti ke parv par, ham bhi sankalp karen
 In our village, in the city, in the locality, the daughter or son of the poorest of the poor should not remain illiterate
 sarkaar apana karttavya kare, samaaj kaa usamen saath mili to ham zarur santosh kii anubhuti karte hai
 i feel like sharing a pleasure and an agony
 mujhe is baat kaa garv hota he ki bharat kii do betiyon ne desh ke naam ko raushan kiya
 One daughter Saina Nehwal became number one in the world in badminton, and the other daughter Sania Mirza became number one in the world in tennis doubles
 donon ko badhai, or desh kii sari betiyon ko bhi badhai
 Proud of their efforts and might
 lekin kabhi-kabhi ham bhi aapa kho baithte hai
 When the cricket World Cup was going on and we lost to Australia in the semi-finals, the kind words that some people used for our players, which behaved, my countrymen, is not good
 aisa kaisaa khel ho jisamen kabhi paraajay hi na ho are jai or paraajay to jindagi ke hisse hote hai
 If the players of our country have ever lost, they should be encouraged in times of crisis
 unka nayaa vishwaas paidaa karne kaa maahaul bananaa chaiye
 i am confident that from the future we will learn from the defeat and will not get entangled in the action and reaction in a moment by losing balance in the things which are associated with the honor of the country
 or mujhe kabhi-kabhi chintaa ho rahi he
 Whenever i see that something happens suddenly, a crowd gathers and burns the car
 or ham tivi par in chizon ko dekhte bhi hai
 Should not be an accident sarkaar ne bhi har prakaar kii koshish kerani chaiye
 But tell my countrymen that by expressing anger in this way, we burn the truck, burn the car
 
 
 
 Dead does not come back kya ham apane man ke bhaavon ko santulit rakhke kanoon ko kanoon kaa kaam nahin karne de sakate hai? sochna chaiye
 Well, today my mind is very distressed due to these incidents, especially due to natural calamities, but in the midst of it, with patience, with confidence, you will also take the country forward, any person of this country
 
 
 dalit ho, peedit ho, shoshit ho, vanchit ho, adivasee ho, gaanv kaa ho, garib ho, kisaan ho, chota vyapaaree ho, koi bhi ho, har ek ke kalyaan ke maarg par, ham sankalp ke saath aage badhate rahenge
 Students' examinations have been completed, especially students of 10th and 12th must have made holiday programs, i wish you all the best
 aapkaa vekeshan bahut hi acha rahe, jivan main kuch nayaa seekhney kaa, nayaa jaanane kaa avasar mili, or saal bhar aapane mehnat kii he to kuch pal parivaar ke saath umang or utsaah ke saath beete yahi meri shubhakamana he

 My greetings to all of you
 tippaniyan Thank you
 lekin maanavtaa kii apni ek takat hoti he
 Nepal is its own for 125 crore people
 un logon kaa dukh bhi hamaara dukh he
 India will try its best to wipe the tears of every Nepali at the time of this disaster, will also hold their hand, will also support them
 pichley dinon yaman main, hamaare hajaaron bhartiya bhai bahan fanse hue the
 In the midst of the terrible horrors of war, amidst the tension of a bomb shotgun, evacuating the Indians, firing them alive, was a very difficult task
 lekin ham kar paae
 Not only this, when it was saved by bringing a girl of one week of age, it seemed that humanity too has great power
 bam-bandook kii varsha chalati ho, maut kaa saaya ho, or ek saptaah kii bacchee apni jindagi bachaa sake tab ek man ko santosh hota he
 Wherever i went abroad in the past, many congratulations were received for one thing, and it was in Yemen that we rescued citizens of about 48 countries of the world
 chaahe america ho, you
 K
 ho, france ho, rashia ho, germany ho, japan ho, har desh ke naagarik ko hamane madad kii thi
 And because of this, this "seva Parmo Dharma" of India in the world has been realized by the world
 hamaara videsh mantralay, hamaari vaayu sena, hamaari nausena itane dhairya ke saath, itani jimmevary ke saath, is kaam ko kiya he, duniya main isaki amit chhap rahegi aane vaale dinon main, aisa main vishwaas karata hum
 And i am glad that everybody came out without any loss
 vaise bhi bharat kaa ek gun, bharat ke sanskaar bahut puraane hai
 Just when i went to France, in France, i went to a World War i memorial
 uskaa ek kaaran bhi tha, ki pratham vishwa yuddh kii shatabdi to he, lekin saath-saath bharat kii parakram kaa bhi wo shatabdi varsh haii bharat ke veeron kii balidani kii shatabdi kaa varsh he or “seva parmo-dharmah” is adarsh ko kaise charitaarth karata rahaa hamaara desh , uski bhi shatabdi kaa yah varsh he, main yah isliye kah rahaa hum ki 1914 main or 1918 tak pratham vishwa yuddh chalaa or bahut kam logon ko maaloom hoga kareeb-kareeb 15 lakh bhartiya sainikon ne is yuddh main apni jaan kii baaji laga di thi or bharat ke jawan apane liye nahin mar rahe thei hindustan ko, kisi desh ko kabja nahin karnaa tha, na hindustan ko kisi kii jameen leni thi lekin bharatiyon ne ek adbhut parakram karke dikhaaya thai bahut kam logon ko maaloom hoga is pratham vishwa yuddh main hamaare kareeb-kareeb 74 hajaar javaanon ne shahadat kii thi, ye bhi garv kii baat he ki is par kareeb 9 hajaar 2 sau hamaare sainikon ko galentry award se decorat kiya gaya thai itnaa hi nahin, 11 aise parakramee log the jinako sarvshereshth sammaan victoria cross mila thai khaskar ki france main vishwa yuddh ke darmiyaan march 1915 main kareeb 4 hajaar 7 sau hamaare hindustaniyon ne balidaan diya tha
 France has built a memorial in his honor
 main vahaan naman karne gaya tha, hamaare purvajon ke parakram ke prati shradhdha vyakt karne gaya tha
 If we see all these events, then we can say to the world that this country is one which thinks for the peace of the world, for the happiness of the world, for the welfare of the world
 kuch na kuch karata he or zarurat pade to jaan kii baazi bhi laga detaa he
 In the United Nations too, India has also been named in the first line of the contribution of Peacekeeping Force
 yahi to ham logon ke liye garv kii baat he
 Recently, i had the opportunity to do two important things
 ham poojya baba sahib ambedkar kii 125 veen jainti kaa varsh manaa rahe hai
 For many years, there was a dispute of land in Mumbai to build his memorial
 mujhe aaj is baat kaa santosh he ki bharat sarkaar ne wo jameen baba sahib ambedkar ke smarak banane ke liye dene kaa nirnay kar liya
 Similarly, in Delhi, an international center should be established in the name of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the whole world should know this Manishi, know his thoughts, know his work
 ye bhi varshon se lataka padaa vishay tha, isko bhi puraa kiya, shilanyas kiya, or 20 saal se jo kaam nahin hua tha wo 20 maheenon main puraa karne kaa sankalp kiya
 And at the same time, a thought has come to my mind and we are engaged, even today there are some families in our country who are forced to carry the dirt on the head
 kya hamen shobhaa detaa he ki aaj bhi hamaare desh main kuch pariwaron ko sar par mailaa dhonaa pade? maine sarkaar main bade aagrah se kaha he ki baba sahib ambedkar ji ke punya samaran karte hue 125 veen jainti ke varsh main, ham is kalank se mukti paaen
 Now in our country, any poor has to carry scum on the head, we will not bear this situation
 samaaj kaa bhi saath chaiye
 The government should also fulfill its obligation
 mujhe janata kaa bhi sahyog chaiye, is kaam ko hamen karnaa he
 Baba Saheb Ambedkar used to say to be educated throughout his life
 aaj bhi hamaare kai dalit, peedit, shoshit, vanchit samaaj main, khaas karke betiyon main, shiksha abhi pahaunchi nahin he
 On the occasion of the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, let us also resolve
 hamaare gaanv main, nagar main, mohalle main garib se garib kii beti yaa betaa, anpadh na rahe
 If the government does its duty, if the society gets along with it, then we definitely feel satisfaction
 mujhe ek anand kii baat share karne kaa man karata he or ek pidaa bhi bataane kaa man karata he
 i feel proud that two daughters of India brightened the name of the country
 ek beti saina nehwal badminton main duniya main number ek bani, or duusari beti sania mirza tennis dubles main duniya main number ek bani
 Congratulations to both, and also to all the daughters of the country
 garv hota he apano ke purusharth or parakram ko lekar ke
 But sometimes we also lose temper
 jab cricket kaa world cap chal rahaa tha or semi-final main ham australia se haar gaye, kuch logon ne hamaare khilaadiyon ke liye jis prakaar ke shabdon kaa prayog kiya, jo vyavhaar kiya, mere deshavaasiyo, ye acha nahin he
 What should be the game in which there is no defeat, Jai and defeat are part of life
 agar hamaare desh ke khilaadi kabhi haar gaye hai to sankat kii ghadi main unka hausala buland karnaa chaiye
 An atmosphere should be created to create their new faith
 mujhe vishwaas he aage se ham paraajay se bhi seekhenge or desh ke sammaan ke saath jo baaten judi hui hai, usamen pal bhar main hi santulan kho karke, kriya-pratikriya main nahin ulajh jaayenge
 And I'm worried sometimes
 main jab kabhi dekhtaa hum ki kahin aksmaat ho gaya, to bheed ikatthi hoti he or gaadi ko jala detii he
 And we also see these things on TV
 accident nahin hona chaiye
 The government should also make every effort
 lekin mere deshavaasiyo bataaiye ki is prakaar se gussa prakat karke ham trek ko jala den, gaadi ko jala den
 
 
 
 mara hua to waapas aata nahin he
 Can we not allow the law to work as a law by keeping our feelings of mind balanced? Should think khayr, aaj meraa man in ghatnaon ke kaaran bada vyathit he, khaas karke prakritik aapadaaon ke kaaran, lekin iske bich bhi dhairya ke saath, aatmavishvaas ke saath desh ko bhi aage le jaayenge, is desh kaa koi bhi vyakti
 
 
 Be it Dalit, victim, exploited, deprived, tribal, village, poor, farmer, small businessman, anyone, on the path of welfare of everyone, we will keep moving forward with determination
 vidhyaarthiyon kii parikshaayen purna hui hai, khaas kar ke 10 veen or 12 veen ke vidhyaarthiyon ne chuttee manaane ke kaarykram banaae honge, meri aap sabko shubhakamanaayen hai
 Your vacation is very good, you have an opportunity to learn something new in life, to learn new, and you have worked hard throughout the year, then it is my wish to spend some moments with family with enthusiasm and enthusiasm
 aap sabko meraa namaskara

 hamaara videsh mantralay, hamaari vaayu sena, hamaari nausena itane dhairya ke saath, itani jimmevary ke saath, is kaam ko kiya he, duniya main isaki amit chhap rahegi aane vaale dinon main, aisa main vishwaas karata hum
 And i am glad that everybody came out without any loss
 vaise bhi bharat kaa ek gun, bharat ke sanskaar bahut puraane hai
 Just when i went to France, in France, i went to a World War i memorial
 uskaa ek kaaran bhi tha, ki pratham vishwa yuddh kii shatabdi to he, lekin saath-saath bharat kii parakram kaa bhi wo shatabdi varsh haii bharat ke veeron kii balidani kii shatabdi kaa varsh he or “seva parmo-dharmah” is adarsh ko kaise charitaarth karata rahaa hamaara desh , uski bhi shatabdi kaa yah varsh he, main yah isliye kah rahaa hum ki 1914 main or 1918 tak pratham vishwa yuddh chalaa or bahut kam logon ko maaloom hoga kareeb-kareeb 15 lakh bhartiya sainikon ne is yuddh main apni jaan kii baaji laga di thi or bharat ke jawan apane liye nahin mar rahe thei hindustan ko, kisi desh ko kabja nahin karnaa tha, na hindustan ko kisi kii jameen leni thi lekin bharatiyon ne ek adbhut parakram karke dikhaaya thai bahut kam logon ko maaloom hoga is pratham vishwa yuddh main hamaare kareeb-kareeb 74 hajaar javaanon ne shahadat kii thi, ye bhi garv kii baat he ki is par kareeb 9 hajaar 2 sau hamaare sainikon ko galentry award se decorat kiya gaya thai itnaa hi nahin, 11 aise parakramee log the jinako sarvshereshth sammaan victoria cross mila thai khaskar ki france main vishwa yuddh ke darmiyaan march 1915 main kareeb 4 hajaar 7 sau hamaare hindustaniyon ne balidaan diya tha
 France has built a memorial in his honor
 main vahaan naman karne gaya tha, hamaare purvajon ke parakram ke prati shradhdha vyakt karne gaya tha
 If we see all these events, then we can say to the world that this country is one which thinks for the peace of the world, for the happiness of the world, for the welfare of the world
 kuch na kuch karata he or zarurat pade to jaan kii baazi bhi laga detaa he
 In the United Nations too, India has also been named in the first line of the contribution of Peacekeeping Force
 yahi to ham logon ke liye garv kii baat he
 Recently, i had the opportunity to do two important things
 ham poojya baba sahib ambedkar kii 125 veen jainti kaa varsh manaa rahe hai
 For many years, there was a dispute of land in Mumbai to build his memorial
 mujhe aaj is baat kaa santosh he ki bharat sarkaar ne wo jameen baba sahib ambedkar ke smarak banane ke liye dene kaa nirnay kar liya
 Similarly, in Delhi, an international center should be established in the name of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the whole world should know this Manishi, know his thoughts, know his work
 ye bhi varshon se lataka padaa vishay tha, isko bhi puraa kiya, shilanyas kiya, or 20 saal se jo kaam nahin hua tha wo 20 maheenon main puraa karne kaa sankalp kiya
 And at the same time, a thought has come to my mind and we are engaged, even today there are some families in our country who are forced to carry the dirt on the head
 kya hamen shobhaa detaa he ki aaj bhi hamaare desh main kuch pariwaron ko sar par mailaa dhonaa pade? maine sarkaar main bade aagrah se kaha he ki baba sahib ambedkar ji ke punya samaran karte hue 125 veen jainti ke varsh main, ham is kalank se mukti paaen
 Now in our country, any poor has to carry scum on the head, we will not bear this situation
 samaaj kaa bhi saath chaiye
 The government should also fulfill its obligation
 mujhe janata kaa bhi sahyog chaiye, is kaam ko hamen karnaa he
 Baba Saheb Ambedkar used to say to be educated throughout his life
 aaj bhi hamaare kai dalit, peedit, shoshit, vanchit samaaj main, khaas karke betiyon main, shiksha abhi pahaunchi nahin he
 On the occasion of the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, let us also resolve
 hamaare gaanv main, nagar main, mohalle main garib se garib kii beti yaa betaa, anpadh na rahe
 If the government does its duty, if the society gets along with it, then we definitely feel satisfaction
 mujhe ek anand kii baat share karne kaa man karata he or ek pidaa bhi bataane kaa man karata he
 i feel proud that two daughters of India brightened the name of the country
 ek beti saina nehwal badminton main duniya main number ek bani, or duusari beti sania mirza tennis dubles main duniya main number ek bani
 Congratulations to both, and also to all the daughters of the country
 garv hota he apano ke purusharth or parakram ko lekar ke
 But sometimes we also lose temper
 jab cricket kaa world cap chal rahaa tha or semi-final main ham australia se haar gaye, kuch logon ne hamaare khilaadiyon ke liye jis prakaar ke shabdon kaa prayog kiya, jo vyavhaar kiya, mere deshavaasiyo, ye acha nahin he
 What should be the game in which there is no defeat, Jai and defeat are part of life
 agar hamaare desh ke khilaadi kabhi haar gaye hai to sankat kii ghadi main unka hausala buland karnaa chaiye
 An atmosphere should be created to create their new faith
 mujhe vishwaas he aage se ham paraajay se bhi seekhenge or desh ke sammaan ke saath jo baaten judi hui hai, usamen pal bhar main hi santulan kho karke, kriya-pratikriya main nahin ulajh jaayenge
 And I'm worried sometimes
 main jab kabhi dekhtaa hum ki kahin aksmaat ho gaya, to bheed ikatthi hoti he or gaadi ko jala detii he
 And we also see these things on TV
 accident nahin hona chaiye
 The government should also make every effort
 lekin mere deshavaasiyo bataaiye ki is prakaar se gussa prakat karke ham trek ko jala den, gaadi ko jala den
 
 
 
 mara hua to waapas aata nahin he
 Can we not allow the law to work as a law by keeping our feelings of mind balanced? Should think khayr, aaj meraa man in ghatnaon ke kaaran bada vyathit he, khaas karke prakritik aapadaaon ke kaaran, lekin iske bich bhi dhairya ke saath, aatmavishvaas ke saath desh ko bhi aage le jaayenge, is desh kaa koi bhi vyakti
 
 
 Be it Dalit, victim, exploited, deprived, tribal, village, poor, farmer, small businessman, anyone, on the path of welfare of everyone, we will keep moving forward with determination
 vidhyaarthiyon kii parikshaayen purna hui hai, khaas kar ke 10 veen or 12 veen ke vidhyaarthiyon ne chuttee manaane ke kaarykram banaae honge, meri aap sabko shubhakamanaayen hai
 Your vacation is very good, you have an opportunity to learn something new in life, to learn new, and you have worked hard throughout the year, then it is my wish to spend some moments with family with enthusiasm and enthusiasm
 aap sabko meraa namaskara
