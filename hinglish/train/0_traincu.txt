 Minister of State in the PMO, who took office on Tuesday, said that the Modi government is ready to discuss Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir
 iske kuch der baad jammu-kashmir ke siem umr abdulla ne jitendra singh ke bayaan ko gaiyr jimmedaarana qaraar diya
 Abdullah tweeted and said, "either Jammu and Kashmir will not be a part of India or Article 370 will exist
 ' unhone kaha ki anuchhed 370 kii vajah se hi kashmir shesh bharat se judaa hua he
 Omar, while advising the BJP to preserve its tweet, said that the withdrawal of Article 370 is not only on the basis of lack of information but also irresponsible
 So the new MOS PMO says process / discussions to revoke Art 370 have started
 Wow, that was a quick start
 Not sure who is talking 1 / n— Omar Abdullah (@abdullah_omar)may 27, 2014mark my words & save this tweet - long after Modi Govt is a distant memory either J&K won't be part of India or Art 370 will still exist 2 / n— Omar Abdullah (@abdullah_omar)may 27, 2014art 370 is the ONLY constitutional link between J&K & rest of India
 Talk of revocation of not just ill informed it's irresponsible

 Like any other issue, it's best for the health of our nation that Article 370 giving special status to J&K be open to public debate
 # India— Rajyavardhan Rathore (@ra_thore)may 27, 2014indians have bled enough for J&K to belong to anyone else but India
 Should a debate be struck down by CM J&K by an ultimatum to break away? - Rajyavardhan Rathore (@ra_thore) May 27, 2014 Earlier, Jitendra Singh said that Article 370 should be discussed
 haalanki, unhone yah bhi saaf kiya ki is prakriya ke jariye jo asahmat hai, unhen samajhane kii koshish kii jaaegi
 Significantly, Modi raised the issue of discussing Article 370 during a rally in the state last year
 singh ne modi kii us baat ko aage badhaate hue kaha, 'unki (modi) or sarkaar kii ichha he ki ham is par charchaa karen jisase ki ham anuchhed 370 se ho rahe nuksaan ke bare main asahmat logon ko samajha saken
 If we do not discuss, then how can we explain to those people what they have been deprived of because of Article 370
 'unhone kaha ki anuchhed 370 bhautik se kahin adhik manovaigyanik baadha he or modi sarkaar ise waapas lene se hone vaale phayda or nuksaan ke bare main yuvakon sahit sab hit dharakon se charchaa ke liye taiyaar he
 PDP also criticized j & J's party PDP also criticized Jitendra Singh's statement
 pidipi netaa mahabuuba mufti ne kaha, 'pradhanmantri se aagrah he ki anuchhed 370 par aisi awaajon par lagaam lagaaein
 It is unfortunate that the Minister, who hails from Jammu and Kashmir, made such remarks on the very first day of taking charge
 haalanki, bavaal badhane par jitendra singh ne safai di ki anuchhed 370 par unke bayaan ko tod-marodakar pesh kiya gaya
 He said, 'I have not said anything quoting PM Narendra Modi

 banavaari laal ji kii khyaati hi is baat kii thi ki ve dharmashala, sarai ke liye kaaphi dhan-daulat or zamin daan main dete the
 He was a great merchant of Saran at that time and also controlled the trade through the river

 shah banavaari laal ji ne kitna kuch daan kar diya, bagaiyr soche ki 21veen sadi kaa hindustan yaad bhi karegaa yaa nahin
 The history of a university or college is not about a class room alone
 wo shahar or uske samaaj kaa bhi itihaas hota he

 do saal se sarkaar ne is college ko paisa nahin diya he
 The government has not given its share in lieu of non-payment of fees
 rajend college chhapra se rahul sankrutyaayan kaa naam bhi judaa he
 The great Hindi litterateur Shiva Pujan Sahay used to teach here

 This college was built by the late Baidyanath Prasad Ji
 aaj yahaan 12,000 chaatro ko padhaane ke liye maatr 27 professor-lekturer hai

 It is telling that degrees are being given without lab
 ye hanikaarak hi nahin aparaadh bhi he
 Someone will ask their leaders what they left out when they were not going to teach our children
 kya yahi kaaran he ki aaj uniwarsity se zyaada whats ap uniwarsity lokapriy he, professor se zyaada chaatr yaa yuva netaaon ke propeganda ko itihaas or vigyaan maan kar sweekaar kar rahe hai
 JP was born on October 11, but the death was on October 8, so between 8 and 11 October, programs are being conducted in this university about JP
 iske liye alag se bajet nahin aayaa he
 But every kind of competition is happening
 jepi ko yaad karne ke liye in chaatro ne kitni mehnat kii hogi, magar jinhen jepi ke naam par raaj mila he, unhone is uniwarsity ke liye kitni mehnat kii he
 Debate, essay writing competition is being organized
 yahi nahin jepi kii yaad main college main rojgaar mela bhi laga hua tha

 2015-18 or 2-16-19 batch kaa imtahaan kab hoga, kisi ko pataa nahin
 Why are these sessions late in university
 isliye hote hai taaki berojgaaron ko kuch saal vahiin campus main roak kar rakho
 Bihar's Education Minister should get a patent on how the session is late
 chhapra ke ramajaypal college ke itihaas vibhaag main paanch saal se ek bhi teacher nahin he
 Think what history these students must have read without a teacher for five years
 aajkal netaa subah-subah jayanti-punyatithi par yaad karne vaale card twit kar dete hai
 You might also wonder how much they respect their old leaders
 haal aap apni ankhon se dekh hi rahe hai
 The leader remembers for the vote
 1972 main gopalganj main mahila vishvavidhyalay kii sthapana hui
 Like the Vice Chancellor of JP University, the principal here also said that speak with my name
 ham kiran ji kii is himmat kaa ehtaraam karte hai
 Many principals started shivering as soon as the phone ran out, hiding their good name
 khasta haal college kaa haal bhi aise bataane lage jaise bharat kaa number ek college unheen kaa ho
 But Kiran ji is not like this
 unhone bataaya ki is college main 26 professor, lekturer hone chahie magar puure nahin hai
 Sanskrit
 itihaas, manovigyaan, raajnneeti vigyaan main koi professor nahin he
 There is a professor in Hindi who is about to retire
 non teaching kii bahut sari siten khaali hai
 There was no restoration for a long time
 college kii saaf-safai karne ke liye bhi log nahin hai
 There are around 960 students
 bhawan kii haalat kharaab he, pustkaalay he lekin librrarian nahin he
 Principal Dr
 Kiran Kumari is continuously writing to the university but there is no hearing
 jab netaa kaa kaam murti banavaakar, jayanti manavaa kar chal hi jaataa he to skool-college main padhaane ke liye professor-teacher kyon rakhen
 Similarly, HR College is a college in Marawa
 yahaan maatr 4 professor hai, hone chahie 17
 We took the hall of the university built in memory of Jayaprakash Narayan
 ab ham dindalai upaadhyaay kii smriti main bane vishvavidhyalay kaa haal lenge
 Deen Dayal Upadhyay University, Gorakhpur
 1957 se gorakhpur uniwarsity chal rahi he
 This university was started with the efforts of Pandit SM Tripathi
 manhat digvijaynath kaa bhi yogadan tha, unheen kii parampara ke duusare uttaradhikari yogi adityanath uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri hai
 Looking at the photos, it seemed that the campus of Gorakhpur University is very bright and clean
 gorakhpur uniwarsity kaa naam dinadayal upaadhyaay gorakhpur uniwarsity he
 This campus has more than 16000 students
 har saal yahaan 5000 se adhik chaatr admician lete hai
 How many teachers come to this university campus, we are coming to that
 365 pad yahaan manzur hai magar 25 pad khaali hai
 This time the university has advertised for reinstatement, recruitment for about 212 posts has been released
 ummid he uniwarsity is samasya se mukti paa legi
 But what is the condition of the rest of the colleges associated with the university, we do not have complete information about how many recruitments have to be made there
 hamane apni report ke liye 2016-17 ke liye uniwarsity ke bajet patr kaa sahaara liya he
 Students here pay about 74 crores rupees to this university through various fees, but in return they get an empty class room
 bajet patr dekh kar pataa chal rahaa he ki kai jagahon par bhayankar katautee he
 Like the actual budget of the chemistry department in 2014-15 was more than 11 lakhs
 magar 2015-16 kaa anumaanit bajet 8 lakh kar diya gaya he
 Three lakhs have been deducted
 tippaniyan For how many years this university would have gone without teachers, what would have happened to those students
 unhen hi jab apni zindagi se matlab nahin to ham kitna pareshaan ho
 Nevertheless, Gorakhpur University hired adhoc from 1998 to 2003
 inhen maandey shikshak kaha jaataa he
 Those who previously taught at a salary of 5000 per month, which later increased to 8000 per month
 2006 main uniwarsity kii kaaryaparishad ne 2004 tak maandey par rakhe gaye shikshakon ko niyamit karne kaa prastaav paas kiya magar wo faisla lagu nahin hua
 In 2010, the university suddenly fired 87 honorarium teachers, who have taught for at least 8 years and for more than 15 years
 ab ye sadak par hai
 Honorary teachers are struggling by forming associations
 2014 main saansad ke taur par yogi adityanath ne inke liye patr bhi likhaa tha
 Now he is the Chief Minister
 maandey shikshak associesan maandey ke saath-saath dhyandey ke liye bhi sangharsh kar rahaa he taaki koi to inaki taraf dhyaan de
 During these studies it was found that the condition of linguistic subjects is worst
 hindi or sanskrit ke naam par netaa log shahar main danga kara den, uttar-dakshin bharat ko bhida den magar jagah-jagah hindi or sanskrit vibhaag bagair prophessoron ke chal rahe hai
 Urdu is also similar to these
 hamane prime time main jo series shuru kii he, usamen bahut hi kam vishvavidhyalayon or collejon kaa haal ham le paaen hai, magar usamen se hi pataa chalata he ki collejon main professor, lekturer ke kai hazaar khaali pade hai
 These vacancies have been around for many years
 kahin-kahin se bees-bees saal se hai
 Still no one demands that if there is a job then give us employment
 permanent hona bharat ke yuvaaon kaa sapana he, is sapane ke naam par college or uniwarsity unhen guest lekturer rakhti he, edock rakhti he, dihadi detii he or kai saal unako jhansa dene ke baad baahar kar detii he
 The youth of India have never felt that some questions should be answered in the whatsapp University on this issue
 jepi ke andolan kii nishaani bhale na bachi ho magar unka naam lekar saansad mantri banane vaale bahut log bache hai
 The history of Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan has been brilliant even during the independence movement and even after independence
 apatkaal ke dauraan jaiprakash narayan ne jis sampurna kranti kaa naaraa diya tha, ab uski koi nishaani nahin bachi he
 jp's fighters have started taking pension from 5000 to 10,000
 jepi kaa naam lekar kai netaaon kii sarkaar ain, sarkaar main aakar unhone bhi vahi kiya jiske kilaaf jepi lade
 Corruption is an important part of their politics, some have corruption in the name of familyism, and in the name of individualism
 sab apane-apane avasaron ke hisaab se bhrashtachar ke muddon ko pahachaanate hai, bolne or chup rahane kii ranneeti tay karte hai
 jp's movement was a successful movement of courage to raise voice, but later failed to achieve all his goals
 is fail andolan kaa naam lekar kai netaa safal hai
 They present themselves as revolutionaries, while their politics shines only on the basis of black money
 yah bhi kam badi baat nahin ki jaiprakash narayan kaa naam lene vaaleaj kai netaa mukhyamantri hai, kendriya mantri hai, rajyapal hai
 So many successful heroes of a failed revolution
 jepi ke naam par ek uniwarsity he bihar main
 Sampoorna Kranti is a slogan, Jaypee University of Chapra
 jab jepi ke naam par ek dhang kii uniwarsity nahin bana sake to aap samaj sakate hai ki hamaare netaa jepi ke naam kaa istamaal hi karte hai
 Jayaprakash Narayan University was established in 1990 for Siwan, Gopalganj, Chapra districts
 27 saal baad bhi yah vishvavidhyalay bihar kii shiksha ke nakshe par kahin nazar nahin aata he
 It is not even named in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) ranking recently released by the Ministry of Human Resource Development
 jepi uniwarsity main na to jepi kaa kuch he, na uniwarsity kaa kuch he
 The university was established in 1990 on 240 acres of land in Mala Mirza Piece village
 isse to acha ki yahaan par kheti hi hoti rahati
 Even after 27 years, the infrastructure of this university is not fully developed
 iske antargat 32 kalege aate hai jisamen under graduate or post graduate ke 47000 chaatr padhate hai
 47000 students come to know that if they are falling prey to the Jhansa project of making Vishwa Guru for Guru, then a JP is born in them
 is uniwarsity main 750 professor, lekturer hone chahie the magar hai sirf 300, jisamen se 100 haal-philhal main niyukt hue hai
 450 posts are empty
 50 fisadi se zyaada pad khaali hai
 It has 17 post graduate departments, usually a separate restoration for it, but college teachers are asked to take PG classes only
 uniwarsity ke kulapati professor harikesh singh sweekaar karte hai ki uniwarsity apni sthapana ke rajat jayanti varsh main he or abhi tak ek bhi imaarat puri banakar taiyaar nahin hui he
 There is a college of this university, Rajendra College is in Chapra
 yah bihar kaa aitihaasik college he jise 1 agast, 1938 ke din sthapit kiya gaya tha
 If Banwari Lalji of Chhapra had not given a building, 20 bighas, 12 katthas and 11 dhur of land, this college would not have existed here
 aaj bhi yah college 1939 ke pehle bane is bhawan main chal rahaa he
 Banwari Lal Shah ji also has his own history
 google search se ek kitaab kaa pataa chalaa, Communication and Colonialism in Eastern India: Bihar, 1760s-1880s, iske lekhak nitin sinha ne likhaa he ki british sarkaar ne saaran ke colector ko kaha gaya ki darbar kaa aayojan karen or unhen shah kii oopaadhi kaa sanad pradaan karen
 It was the fame of Banwari Lal ji that he used to donate a lot of wealth and land for Dharamshala, Sarai
 ve us samay saaran ke bade vyapaaree the or nadi ke raste hone vaale vyapaar ko bhi control karte the
 Banwari Lal Shah lived in Katra Mohalla of Chapra
 ve aajkal vaale shah kii tarah nahin the jo sau karod kii manahani kaa mukadmaa kar dete hai
 Shah Banwari Lal ji donated so much, without thinking whether 21st century India will remember it or not
 vishvavidhyalay yaa college kaa itihaas akele class room kaa nahin hota he
 It also has a history of the city and its society
 isliye ham rajendra college chhapra kii baat karte-karte banavaari laal shah ji ke bare main baat karne lage
 The Chhapra Municipality was formed in 1866
 1939 main tatkaaleen nagarpalika ke upaadhyaksh hariharsharan ji ne dow
 The college opened in the name of Rajendra Prasad, when Rajendra Prasad did not become the first President of India, India's independence was eight years away, but Dr
 rajendra prasad ke naam par unke jiiteji college kaise bana
 It is also a history
 us vakt bihar main baadh ai thi or rajendra babu apane raahat ke kaam se kaaphi lokapriy ho gaye
 In honor of that work, Rajendra Prasad College opened in Chapra
 unke bade bhai mahendra prasad kaa bhi chhapra ke shaharikaran main yogadan tha
 There is a saying that if Mahendra were not there, Rajendra would not have been there
 yah sab jaankaree political science vibhaag ke pramukh professor laal babu yadav ne hamen di
 Today, 157 professors and lecturers are required to teach in that college, but the college is running on the strength of 33 professors
 chemistry, sanskrit, urdu main to koi padhaane vaala hi nahin he
 There are only one teacher each in Geography, Hindi, Commerce
 is college main 5000 chaatr padhate hai
 For two years, the government has not given money to this college
 fees nahin lene ke evaz main sarkaar ne apana hissaa nahin diya he
 The name of Rahul Sankrityayan is also associated with Rajendra College Chhapra
 hindi ke mahaan sahityakar shiv pujan sahay ji yaheen padhaate the
 Former Chief Minister Daroga Prasad Rai was a student of this place
 maharajaganj se bhaajapa saansad janardan sigrival yaheen ke chaatr the
 Manoranjan Sinha, who brought the beggar Thakur to the fore, was the principal of this college
 magar ab is college main padhaane vaala nahin he
 There is no name of study nor nomination
 150 computer hai lekin unhen chalaane ke liye computer oparator maatr ek he
 DAV College Siwan is 1941
 swargeey baidhnath prasad ji ne is college ko banwaaya tha
 Today there are only 27 professor-lecturers to teach 12,000 students
 ek shikshak par 444 chaatro kaa bhaar aata he
 There are no professors in Botany, Geography, Sanskrit
 57 pad hi manzur hai jisamen se 30 pad khaali hai
 It was told that the 18 professors who have retired, they are called only occasionally, whose money is not given, but they come and study
 bihar ke shiksha mantri kaam kya karte hai, ram jane
 There are few tools in science here in college, otherwise running classes without lab
 yah sirf hanikaarak nahin aparaadh bhi he
 All the Vice Chancellors we have talked to have met someone who is honestly saying his agony
 bataa rahaa he ki bina prayogshaala ke digriyaan di ja rahi hai
 This is not only harmful but also a crime
 koi apane netaaon se poochhega ki hamaare bacchon ko jab padhaane vaale nahin the, wo kya padhakar nikle
 Is this the reason that whats app university is more popular than university today, more students than professors or young leaders are accepting propaganda as history and science
 jepi kaa janm 11 aktubar ke din hua tha, magar maut 8 aktubar ko hui thi, isliye 8 se 11 oktober ke bich jepi ko lekar is uniwarsity main kaarykram kiye ja rahe hai
 There is no separate budget for this
 magar har tarah kii pratiyogita ho rahi he
 How hard these students must have worked to remember JP, but those who have got secret in jp's name, how hard they have worked for this university
 vaad-vivaad, niabandh lekhan pratiyogita kaa aayojan ho rahaa he
 Not only this, there was also an employment fair in the college in memory of JP
 bina professor ke inhen berojgaar hone laayak banaao or phir unke bich rojgaar mela bhi lagaao
 a picture of which shows that there is a special recruitment drive for the reinstatement of security guards
 matlab dhul jhonkne kaa isse acha udhaaharan kya ho saktaa he
 The 2013–16 batch is not finished until 2017
 yani seshan let he
 Second year examination was to be held in 2015, held in June 2017
 2014-17 batch ke pratham varsh kii pariksha 2015 main ho jaani chahie thi, 2017 june main hui he or abhi tak riselt nahin aayaa he
 No one knows when the test for 2015-18 and 2-16-19 batch will take place
 uniwarsity main ye seshan let kyon hote hai
 This is so that they keep the unemployed in the campus for a few years
 seshan let kaise hota he iskaa patent bihar ke shiksha mantri ko kara lenaa chahie
 There is not a single teacher in the history department of Ramjaypal College, Chapra for five years
 sochie, paanch saal tak bagair teacher ke in chaatro ne kya itihaas padhaa hoga
 Nowadays, leaders tweet memorizing cards in the early morning on the death anniversary
 aap bhi sochate honge ki ye apane puraane netaaon kaa kitna sammaan karte hai
 You are only seeing with your eyes
 netaa vot ke liye yaad karte hai
 In 1972, the Women's University was established in Gopalganj
 jepi uniwarsity ke vaais chancelar kii tarah yahaan kii principal ne bhi kaha ki meraa naam lekar bolie
 We appreciate Kiran Ji's courage
 bahut se principal to phone jate hi kaanpane lage, apana acha khaasaa naam chhipaane lage
 Crispy halls started to describe the condition of the college as if it is their number one college in India
 magar kiran ji aisi nahin hai
 He said that there should be 26 professors, lecturers in this college but they are not complete
 sanskrit
 There is no professor in History, Psychology, Political Science
 hindi main ek professor hai jo ritair hone vaali hai
 Many non-teaching seats are vacant
 arase se bahaali nahin hui
 There are no people to clean the college
 960 ke kareeb chaatra hai
 The building is in poor condition, it is a library but not a librarian
 prisimple dow kiran kumari lagaataar vishvavidhyalay ko likh rahi hai lekin koi sunwaayee nahin he
 When the work of the leader is done by getting the idol made and the birth anniversary celebrated, then why keep a professor-teacher to teach in school-college
 isi tarah mamrava kaa ek college he echaar college
 There are only 4 professors, there should be 17
 jaiprakash narayan kii smriti main bane vishvavidhyalay kaa haal hamane le liya
 Now we will take the condition of the university built in the memory of Deendalaya Upadhyay
 deen dayaal upaadhyaay uniwarsity, gorakhpur chalate hai
 Gorakhpur University has been functioning since 1957
 pandit esaem treepathi ke prayaason se yah uniwarsity shuru hui thi
 Mahant Digvijaynath also contributed, Yogi Adityanath, the second successor of his tradition, is the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh
 tasveeron ko dekh kar yahi laga ki gorakhpur uniwarsity kaa campus kaaphi chamakdaar or saaf-suthra he
 The name of Gorakhpur University is Deendayal Upadhyay Gorakhpur University
 is campus main 16000 se zyaada chaatr hai
 Every year more than 5000 students take admission here
 uniwarsity ke is campus main teacher kitne aate hai, ham us par aa rahe hai
 365 posts are approved here but 25 posts are empty
 is baar uniwarsity ne bahaali kaa vigyaapan nikaala he, kareeb 212 padon kii bhartiyon nikaleen hai
 Hope the university will get rid of this problem
 magar uniwarsity se jude baaki collejon kaa kya haal he, vahaan kitni bhartiyon honi hai, isaki mukammal jaankaree hamaare paas nahin hai
 We have resorted to the university budget paper for 2016-17 for our report
 yahaan ke chaatr, tarah-tarah kii fees ke zarie is uniwarsity ko kareeb 74 karod rupee dete hai, magar badale main miltaa he khaali class room
 Seeing the budget paper, it is known that there are terrible cuts in many places
 jaise 2014-15 main rasayan shaastra vibhaag kaa vaastavik bajet tha 11 lakh se adhik tha
 But the estimated budget for 2015-16 has been increased to 8 lakhs
 teen lakh kii katautee ho gai he
 The comments kitne saal is uniwarsity main bagair shikshakon ke class chali hogi, un chaatro ke saath kya hua hoga
 When they do not mean to their lives, then how upset we are
 phir bhi gorakhpur uniwarsity ne 1998 se lekar 2003 tak edock par shikshak rakhe
 These are called honorarium teachers
 jo pehle 5000 prati maah kii selary par padhaate the jo baad main badhkar 8000 prati maah ho gaya
 In 2006, the University Executive Council passed a proposal to regularize honorarium teachers till 2004, but that decision did not apply
 2010 main uniwarsity ne 87 maandey shikshakon ko achaanak nikaal diya jabaki ye kam se kam 8 saal or adhik se adhik 15 saal tak padhaa chuke hai
 Now they are on the road
 maandey shikshak association banaakar sangharsh kar rahe hai
 In 2014, Yogi Adityanath also wrote a letter for him as an MP
 ab ve mukhyamantri hai
 Along with honorarium teacher honorarium is also struggling for attention so that someone can pay attention to them
 in adhyayanon ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki bhashaai vishyon kii haalat sabase adhik karaab he
 In the name of Hindi and Sanskrit, the leaders make a riot in the city, fight north-south India, but Hindi and Sanskrit departments are running everywhere without professors
 urdu kaa bhi haal inhen ke jaisaa he
 The sign of jp's movement may not have survived, but there are many people who have become MP ministers after his name
 lokanayak jaiprakash narayan kaa itihaas azaadi ke andolan ke samay bhi shandaar rahaa he or azaadi ke baad bhi
 There is no sign of the entire revolution which was given by Jayaprakash Narayan during the Emergency
 jepi ke senaanee 5000 se 1 xxrep 4 0 tak pension lene lage hai
 Many leaders came to the government with the name of JP, after coming to the government they did the same against which JP fought
 bhrashtachar unki raajnneeti kaa ahm hissaa he, kisi ke yahaan parivaarwaad ke naam par bhrashtachar he, to kisi ke yahaan vyaktvaad ke naam par
 Everyone recognizes the issues of corruption according to their own opportunities, decides the strategy of speaking and keeping quiet
 jepi kaa andolan awaz uthaane ke saahas kaa ek safal andolan tha, magar aage chalakar apane tamaam lakshyon ko hasil karne main fail rahaa
 Many leaders are successful in the name of this failed movement
 ve khud ko krantikari kii tarah pesh karte hai, jabaki unki raajnneeti sirf or sirf kaala dhan ke aadhaar par hi chamakati he
 It is not a big deal that today many leaders who take the name of Jayaprakash Narayan are Chief Ministers, Union Ministers, Governors
 ek asafal kranti ke itane saare safal nayak
 There is a university in Bihar named after JP
 sampurna kranti ek pita hua naaraa he, isaki misaal he chhapra kii jepi uniwarsity
 When you could not create a quality university in jp's name, then you can understand that our leaders only use jp's name
 1990 main siwan, gopalganj, chhapra zilon ke liye jaiprakash narayan vishvavidhyalay kii sthapana hui thi
 Even after 27 years, this university does not appear anywhere on the education map of Bihar
 haal hi main maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay kii taraf se jari rashtriya sansthagat ranking fremawork ( NIRF) kii ranking main to iskaa naam bhi nahin he
 In Jaypee University neither Jaypee has anything, nor does University have anything
 1990 main maala mirza tukdaa gaanv kii 240 acre zamin par is uniwarsity kii sthapana kii gai thi
 It is good that there used to be cultivation here
 27 saal baad bhi is uniwarsity kaa buniyadi dhaancha puri tarah viksit nahin hua he
 There are 32 colleges under it in which 47000 students of undergraduate and post graduate study
 47000 chaatro ko yah pataa chal jaae ki ve bagaiyr guru ke liye vishwa guru banane ke jhansa project ke shikaar ho rahe hai to unheen main ek jepi paidaa ho jaae
 There should have been 750 professors, lecturers in this university but there are only 300, out of which 100 have been appointed recently
 450 pad khaali hai
 More than 50 percent of the positions are vacant
 iske paas 17 post graduate vibhaag hai, aamtaur par iske liye alag se bahaali hoti he magar college ke shikshakon se hi piji kii class lene ke liye kaha jaataa he
 University vice-chancellor Professor Harikesh Singh acknowledges that the university is in its silver jubilee year of its establishment and not a single building has been completed yet
 isi uniwarsity kaa ek college he rajendra college chhapra main he
 It is the historical college of Bihar which was established on the 1st of August, 1938
 chhapra ke banavaari laal ji ne agar apana ek bhawan, 20 bigha, 12 kattha or 11 dhur zamin na di hoti to yah college yahaan maujuud na hota
 Even today, this college is running in this building built before 1939
 banavaari laal shah ji kaa bhi apana alag hi itihaas he
 a book from Google search revealed, Communication and Colonialism in Eastern India: Bihar, 1760s-1880s, its author Nitin Sinha wrote that the British government asked the Collector of Saran to organize the court and he received the title of Shah Please provide a note
 banavaari laal ji kii khyaati hi is baat kii thi ki ve dharmashala, sarai ke liye kaaphi dhan-daulat or zamin daan main dete the
 He was a great merchant of Saran at that time and also controlled the trade through the river
 banavaari laal shah chhapra ke katra mohalla main rahete the
 He was not like the present-day Shah who sued for defamation of hundred crores
 shah banavaari laal ji ne kitna kuch daan kar diya, bagaiyr soche ki 21veen sadi kaa hindustan yaad bhi karegaa yaa nahin
 The history of a university or college is not about a class room alone
 wo shahar or uske samaaj kaa bhi itihaas hota he
 Therefore, while talking about Rajendra College Chapra, we started talking about Banwari Lal Shah
 1866 main chhapra nagarpalika kaa gathan ho chukaa tha
 In 1939, the then Municipal vice-president, Hariharsharan Ji, Dr
 rajendra prasad ke naam par college kholaa, tab rajendra prasad bharat ke pratham raashtrapati nahin bane the, bharat kii azaadi aath saal dur thi, lekin dow
 In the name of Rajendra Prasad, how was his Jeetji College formed? yah bhi ek itihaas he
 At that time there was a flood in Bihar and Rajendra Babu became very popular with his relief work
 us kaam ke sammaan main chhapra main rajendra prasad college khulaa
 His elder brother Mahendra Prasad also contributed to the urbanization of Chapra
 ek kahawat he ki mahendra nahin hote to rajend nahin hote
 All this information was given to us by Professor Lal Babu Yadav, Head of the Department of Political Science
 aaj us college main padhaane ke liye 157 professor-lekturer chahie, magar 33 prophessoron ke dam par hi college chal rahaa he
 There is no one to teach in Chemistry, Sanskrit, Urdu
 bhugol, hindi, commers main sirf ek-ek shikshak hai
 5000 students study in this college
 do saal se sarkaar ne is college ko paisa nahin diya he
 The government has not given its share in lieu of non-payment of fees
 rajend college chhapra se rahul sankrutyaayan kaa naam bhi judaa he
 The great Hindi litterateur Shiva Pujan Sahay used to teach here
 purv mukhyamantri daaroga prasad raay yaheen ke chaatr the
 BJP MP from Maharajganj Janardan Sigriwal was a student of this place
 bhikhaari thakur ko saamne laane vaale manoranjan sinha isi college ke praachaarya the
 But now there is no one to teach in this college
 padhai kaa na naam he na namonishaan he
 There are 150 computers but there is only one computer operator to run them
 1941 kaa he diavi college siwan
 This college was built by the late Baidyanath Prasad Ji
 aaj yahaan 12,000 chaatro ko padhaane ke liye maatr 27 professor-lekturer hai
 a teacher weighs 444 students
 botni, bhugol, sanskrit main koi professor nahin hai
 Only 57 posts are approved, out of which 30 posts are vacant
 bataaya gaya ki 18 professor jo ritair hue hai, unhen hi kabhi-kabhaar bula liya jaataa he, jiskaa paisa bhi nahin diya jaataa, magar ve aate hai or padhaa jate hai
 Ram knows what the education minister of Bihar does yahaan mahavidhyalay main vigyaan main thode bahut upkaran hai, anyathaa bina lab ke class chalaa rahe hai
 It is not only harmful but also a crime
 hamane jitne bhi vaais chancelar se baat kii he, koi to mila jo eemaandaaree se apni vyathaa kah rahaa he
 It is telling that degrees are being given without lab
 ye hanikaarak hi nahin aparaadh bhi he
 Someone will ask their leaders what they left out when they were not going to teach our children
 kya yahi kaaran he ki aaj uniwarsity se zyaada whats ap uniwarsity lokapriy he, professor se zyaada chaatr yaa yuva netaaon ke propeganda ko itihaas or vigyaan maan kar sweekaar kar rahe hai
 JP was born on October 11, but the death was on October 8, so between 8 and 11 October, programs are being conducted in this university about JP
 iske liye alag se bajet nahin aayaa he
 But every kind of competition is happening
 jepi ko yaad karne ke liye in chaatro ne kitni mehnat kii hogi, magar jinhen jepi ke naam par raaj mila he, unhone is uniwarsity ke liye kitni mehnat kii he
 Debate, essay writing competition is being organized
 yahi nahin jepi kii yaad main college main rojgaar mela bhi laga hua tha
 Make them unemployable without a professor and then organize employment fair among them
 jisaki ek tasviir se pataa chalata he ki isamen surakshakarmiyon yani security guard kii bahaali ke liye vishesh bhartee abhiyaan chal rahaa he
 Meaning what could be a better example of dusting
 2013-16 kaa batch 2017 tak khatm nahin ho paaya he
 That is, the session is late
 2015 main second year kii pariksha honi thi, 2017 ke june main hui he
 The first year examination of the 2014-17 batch should have been held in 2015, 2017 has been held in June and the result is yet to come
 2015-18 or 2-16-19 batch kaa imtahaan kab hoga, kisi ko pataa nahin
 Why are these sessions late in university
 isliye hote hai taaki berojgaaron ko kuch saal vahiin campus main roak kar rakho
 Bihar's Education Minister should get a patent on how the session is late
 chhapra ke ramajaypal college ke itihaas vibhaag main paanch saal se ek bhi teacher nahin he
 Think what history these students must have read without a teacher for five years
 aajkal netaa subah-subah jayanti-punyatithi par yaad karne vaale card twit kar dete hai
 You might also wonder how much they respect their old leaders
 haal aap apni ankhon se dekh hi rahe hai
 The leader remembers for the vote
 1972 main gopalganj main mahila vishvavidhyalay kii sthapana hui
 Like the Vice Chancellor of JP University, the principal here also said that speak with my name
 ham kiran ji kii is himmat kaa ehtaraam karte hai
 Many principals started shivering as soon as the phone ran out, hiding their good name
 khasta haal college kaa haal bhi aise bataane lage jaise bharat kaa number ek college unheen kaa ho
 But Kiran ji is not like this
 unhone bataaya ki is college main 26 professor, lekturer hone chahie magar puure nahin hai
 Sanskrit
 itihaas, manovigyaan, raajnneeti vigyaan main koi professor nahin he
 There is a professor in Hindi who is about to retire
 non teaching kii bahut sari siten khaali hai
 There was no restoration for a long time
 college kii saaf-safai karne ke liye bhi log nahin hai
 There are around 960 students
 bhawan kii haalat kharaab he, pustkaalay he lekin librrarian nahin he
 Principal Dr
 Kiran Kumari is continuously writing to the university but there is no hearing
 jab netaa kaa kaam murti banavaakar, jayanti manavaa kar chal hi jaataa he to skool-college main padhaane ke liye professor-teacher kyon rakhen
 Similarly, HR College is a college in Marawa
 yahaan maatr 4 professor hai, hone chahie 17
 We took the hall of the university built in memory of Jayaprakash Narayan
 ab ham dindalai upaadhyaay kii smriti main bane vishvavidhyalay kaa haal lenge
 Deen Dayal Upadhyay University, Gorakhpur
 1957 se gorakhpur uniwarsity chal rahi he
 the efforts of Pandit SM Tripathi 
 manhat digvijaynath kaa bhi yogadan tha, unheen kii parampara ke duusare uttaradhikari yogi adityanath uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri hai
 Looking at the photos, it seemed that the campus of Gorakhpur University is very bright and clean
 gorakhpur uniwarsity kaa naam dinadayal upaadhyaay gorakhpur uniwarsity he
 This campus has more than 16000 students
 har saal yahaan 5000 se adhik chaatr admician lete hai
 How many teachers come to this university campus, we are coming to that
 365 pad yahaan manzur hai magar 25 pad khaali hai
 This time the university has advertised for reinstatement, recruitment for about 212 posts has been released
 ummid he uniwarsity is samasya se mukti paa legi
 But what is the condition of the rest of the colleges associated with the university, we do not have complete information about how many recruitments have to be made there
 hamane apni report ke liye 2016-17 ke liye uniwarsity ke bajet patr kaa sahaara liya he
 Students here pay about 74 crores rupees to this university through various fees, but in return they get an empty class room
 bajet patr dekh kar pataa chal rahaa he ki kai jagahon par bhayankar katautee he
 Like the actual budget of the chemistry department in 2014-15 was more than 11 lakhs
 magar 2015-16 kaa anumaanit bajet 8 lakh kar diya gaya he
 Three lakhs have been deducted
 tippaniyan For how many years this university would have gone without teachers, what would have happened to those students
 unhen hi jab apni zindagi se matlab nahin to ham kitna pareshaan ho
 Nevertheless, Gorakhpur University hired adhoc from 1998 to 2003
 inhen maandey shikshak kaha jaataa he
 Those who previously taught at a salary of 5000 per month, which later increased to 8000 per month
 2006 main uniwarsity kii kaaryaparishad ne 2004 tak maandey par rakhe gaye shikshakon ko niyamit karne kaa prastaav paas kiya magar wo faisla lagu nahin hua
 In 2010, the university suddenly fired 87 honorarium teachers, who have taught for at least 8 years and for more than 15 years
 ab ye sadak par hai
 Honorary teachers are struggling by forming associations
 2014 main saansad ke taur par yogi adityanath ne inke liye patr bhi likhaa tha
 Now he is the Chief Minister
 maandey shikshak associesan maandey ke saath-saath dhyandey ke liye bhi sangharsh kar rahaa he taaki koi to inaki taraf dhyaan de
 During these studies it was found that the condition of linguistic subjects is worst
 hindi or sanskrit ke naam par netaa log shahar main danga kara den, uttar-dakshin bharat ko bhida den magar jagah-jagah hindi or sanskrit vibhaag bagair prophessoron ke chal rahe hai
 Urdu is also similar to these
 yah bhi kam badi baat nahin ki jaiprakash narayan kaa naam lene vaaleaj kai netaa mukhyamantri hai, kendriya mantri hai, rajyapal hai
 So many successful heroes of a failed revolution
 jepi ke naam par ek uniwarsity he bihar main
 Sampoorna Kranti is a slogan, Jaypee University of Chapra
 jab jepi ke naam par ek dhang kii uniwarsity nahin bana sake to aap samaj sakate hai ki hamaare netaa jepi ke naam kaa istamaal hi karte hai
 Jayaprakash Narayan University was established in 1990 for Siwan, Gopalganj, Chapra districts
 27 saal baad bhi yah vishvavidhyalay bihar kii shiksha ke nakshe par kahin nazar nahin aata he
 It is not even named in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) ranking recently released by the Ministry of Human Resource Development
 jepi uniwarsity main na to jepi kaa kuch he, na uniwarsity kaa kuch he
 The university was established in 1990 on 240 acres of land in Mala Mirza Piece village
 isse to acha ki yahaan par kheti hi hoti rahati
 Even after 27 years, the infrastructure of this university is not fully developed
 iske antargat 32 kalege aate hai jisamen under graduate or post graduate ke 47000 chaatr padhate hai
 47000 students come to know that if they are falling prey to the Jhansa project of making Vishwa Guru for Guru, then a JP is born in them
 is uniwarsity main 750 professor, lekturer hone chahie the magar hai sirf 300, jisamen se 100 haal-philhal main niyukt hue hai
 450 posts are empty
 50 fisadi se zyaada pad khaali hai
 It has 17 post graduate departments, usually a separate restoration for it, but college teachers are asked to take PG classes only
 uniwarsity ke kulapati professor harikesh singh sweekaar karte hai ki uniwarsity apni sthapana ke rajat jayanti varsh main he or abhi tak ek bhi imaarat puri banakar taiyaar nahin hui he
 There is a college of this university, Rajendra College is in Chapra
 yah bihar kaa aitihaasik college he jise 1 agast, 1938 ke din sthapit kiya gaya tha
 If Banwari Lalji of Chhapra had not given a building, 20 bighas, 12 katthas and 11 dhur of land, this college would not have existed here
 aaj bhi yah college 1939 ke pehle bane is bhawan main chal rahaa he
 Banwari Lal Shah ji also has his own history
 google search se ek kitaab kaa pataa chalaa, Communication and Colonialism in Eastern India: Bihar, 1760s-1880s, iske lekhak nitin sinha ne likhaa he ki british sarkaar ne saaran ke colector ko kaha gaya ki darbar kaa aayojan karen or unhen shah kii oopaadhi kaa sanad pradaan karen
 It was the fame of Banwari Lal ji that he used to donate a lot of wealth and land for Dharamshala, Sarai
 ve us samay saaran ke bade vyapaaree the or nadi ke raste hone vaale vyapaar ko bhi control karte the
 Banwari Lal Shah lived in Katra Mohalla of Chapra
 ve aajkal vaale shah kii tarah nahin the jo sau karod kii manahani kaa mukadmaa kar dete hai
 Shah Banwari Lal ji donated so much, without thinking whether 21st century India will remember it or not
 vishvavidhyalay yaa college kaa itihaas akele class room kaa nahin hota he
 It also has a history of the city and its society
 isliye ham rajendra college chhapra kii baat karte-karte banavaari laal shah ji ke bare main baat karne lage
 The Chhapra Municipality was formed in 1866
 1939 main tatkaaleen nagarpalika ke upaadhyaksh hariharsharan ji ne dow
 The college opened in the name of Rajendra Prasad, when Rajendra Prasad did not become the first President of India, India's independence was eight years away, but Dr
 rajendra prasad ke naam par unke jiiteji college kaise bana
 It is also a history
 us vakt bihar main baadh ai thi or rajendra babu apane raahat ke kaam se kaaphi lokapriy ho gaye
 In honor of that work, Rajendra Prasad College opened in Chapra
 unke bade bhai mahendra prasad kaa bhi chhapra ke shaharikaran main yogadan tha
 There is a saying that if Mahendra were not there, Rajendra would not have been there
 yah sab jaankaree political science vibhaag ke pramukh professor laal babu yadav ne hamen di
 Today, 157 professors and lecturers are required to teach in that college, but the college is running on the strength of 33 professors
 chemistry, sanskrit, urdu main to koi padhaane vaala hi nahin he
 There are only one teacher each in Geography, Hindi, Commerce
 is college main 5000 chaatr padhate hai
 For two years, the government has not given money to this college
 fees nahin lene ke evaz main sarkaar ne apana hissaa nahin diya he
 The name of Rahul Sankrityayan is also associated with Rajendra College Chhapra
 hindi ke mahaan sahityakar shiv pujan sahay ji yaheen padhaate the
 Former Chief Minister Daroga Prasad Rai was a student of this place
 maharajaganj se bhaajapa saansad janardan sigrival yaheen ke chaatr the
 Manoranjan Sinha, who brought the beggar Thakur to the fore, was the principal of this college
 magar ab is college main padhaane vaala nahin he
 There is no name of study nor nomination
 150 computer hai lekin unhen chalaane ke liye computer oparator maatr ek he
 DAV College Siwan is 1941
 swargeey baidhnath prasad ji ne is college ko banwaaya tha
 Today there are only 27 professor-lecturers to teach 12,000 students
 ek shikshak par 444 chaatro kaa bhaar aata he
 There are no professors in Botany, Geography, Sanskrit
 57 pad hi manzur hai jisamen se 30 pad khaali hai
 It was told that the 18 professors who have retired, they are called only occasionally, whose money is not given, but they come and study
 bihar ke shiksha mantri kaam kya karte hai, ram jane
 There are few tools in science here in college, otherwise running classes without lab
 yah sirf hanikaarak nahin aparaadh bhi he
 All the Vice Chancellors we have talked to have met someone who is honestly saying his agony
 bataa rahaa he ki bina prayogshaala ke digriyaan di ja rahi hai
 This is not only harmful but also a crime
 koi apane netaaon se poochhega ki hamaare bacchon ko jab padhaane vaale nahin the, wo kya padhakar nikle
 Is this the reason that whats app university is more popular than university today, more students than professors or young leaders are accepting propaganda as history and science
 jepi kaa janm 11 aktubar ke din hua tha, magar maut 8 aktubar ko hui thi, isliye 8 se 11 oktober ke bich jepi ko lekar is uniwarsity main kaarykram kiye ja rahe hai
 There is no separate budget for this
 magar har tarah kii pratiyogita ho rahi he
 How hard these students must have worked to remember JP, but those who have got secret in jp's name, how hard they have worked for this university
 vaad-vivaad, niabandh lekhan pratiyogita kaa aayojan ho rahaa he
 Not only this, there was also an employment fair in the college in memory of JP
 bina professor ke inhen berojgaar hone laayak banaao or phir unke bich rojgaar mela bhi lagaao
 a picture of which shows that there is a special recruitment drive for the reinstatement of security guards
 matlab dhul jhonkne kaa isse acha udhaaharan kya ho saktaa he
 The 2013–16 batch is not finished until 2017
 yani seshan let he
 Second year examination was to be held in 2015, held in June 2017
 2014-17 batch ke pratham varsh kii pariksha 2015 main ho jaani chahie thi, 2017 june main hui he or abhi tak riselt nahin aayaa he
 No one knows when the test for 2015-18 and 2-16-19 batch will take place
 uniwarsity main ye seshan let kyon hote hai
 This is so that they keep the unemployed in the campus for a few years
 seshan let kaise hota he iskaa patent bihar ke shiksha mantri ko kara lenaa chahie
 There is not a single teacher in the history department of Ramjaypal College, Chapra for five years
 sochie, paanch saal tak bagair teacher ke in chaatro ne kya itihaas padhaa hoga
 Nowadays, leaders tweet memorizing cards in the early morning on the death anniversary
 aap bhi sochate honge ki ye apane puraane netaaon kaa kitna sammaan karte hai
 You are only seeing with your eyes
 netaa vot ke liye yaad karte hai
 In 1972, the Women's University was established in Gopalganj
 jepi uniwarsity ke vaais chancelar kii tarah yahaan kii principal ne bhi kaha ki meraa naam lekar bolie
 We appreciate Kiran Ji's courage
 bahut se principal to phone jate hi kaanpane lage, apana acha khaasaa naam chhipaane lage
 Crispy halls started to describe the condition of the college as if it is their number one college in India
 magar kiran ji aisi nahin hai
 He said that there should be 26 professors, lecturers in this college but they are not complete
 sanskrit
 There is no professor in History, Psychology, Political Science
 hindi main ek professor hai jo ritair hone vaali hai
 Many non-teaching seats are vacant
 arase se bahaali nahin hui
 There are no people to clean the college
 960 ke kareeb chaatra hai
 The building is in poor condition, it is a library but not a librarian
 prisimple dow kiran kumari lagaataar vishvavidhyalay ko likh rahi hai lekin koi sunwaayee nahin he
 When the work of the leader is done by getting the idol made and the birth anniversary celebrated, then why keep a professor-teacher to teach in school-college
 isi tarah mamrava kaa ek college he echaar college
 There are only 4 professors, there should be 17
 jaiprakash narayan kii smriti main bane vishvavidhyalay kaa haal hamane le liya
 Now we will take the condition of the university built in the memory of Deendalaya Upadhyay
 deen dayaal upaadhyaay uniwarsity, gorakhpur chalate hai
 Gorakhpur University has been functioning since 1957
 pandit esaem treepathi ke prayaason se yah uniwarsity shuru hui thi
 Mahant Digvijaynath also contributed, Yogi Adityanath, the second successor of his tradition, is the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh
 tasveeron ko dekh kar yahi laga ki gorakhpur uniwarsity kaa campus kaaphi chamakdaar or saaf-suthra he
 The name of Gorakhpur University is Deendayal Upadhyay Gorakhpur University
 is campus main 16000 se zyaada chaatr hai
 Every year more than 5000 students take admission here
 uniwarsity ke is campus main teacher kitne aate hai, ham us par aa rahe hai
 365 posts are approved here but 25 posts are empty
 is baar uniwarsity ne bahaali kaa vigyaapan nikaala he, kareeb 212 padon kii bhartiyon nikaleen hai
 Hope the university will get rid of this problem
 magar uniwarsity se jude baaki collejon kaa kya haal he, vahaan kitni bhartiyon honi hai, isaki mukammal jaankaree hamaare paas nahin hai
 We have resorted to the university budget paper for 2016-17 for our report
 yahaan ke chaatr, tarah-tarah kii fees ke zarie is uniwarsity ko kareeb 74 karod rupee dete hai, magar badale main miltaa he khaali class room
 Seeing the budget paper, it is known that there are terrible cuts in many places
 jaise 2014-15 main rasayan shaastra vibhaag kaa vaastavik bajet tha 11 lakh se adhik tha
 But the estimated budget for 2015-16 has been increased to 8 lakhs
 teen lakh kii katautee ho gai he
 The comments kitne saal is uniwarsity main bagair shikshakon ke class chali hogi, un chaatro ke saath kya hua hoga
 When they do not mean to their lives, then how upset we are
 phir bhi gorakhpur uniwarsity ne 1998 se lekar 2003 tak edock par shikshak rakhe
 These are called honorarium teachers
 jo pehle 5000 prati maah kii selary par padhaate the jo baad main badhkar 8000 prati maah ho gaya
 In 2006, the University Executive Council passed a proposal to regularize honorarium teachers till 2004, but that decision did not apply
 2010 main uniwarsity ne 87 maandey shikshakon ko achaanak nikaal diya jabaki ye kam se kam 8 saal or adhik se adhik 15 saal tak padhaa chuke hai
 Now they are on the road
 maandey shikshak association banaakar sangharsh kar rahe hai
 In 2014, Yogi Adityanath also wrote a letter for him as an MP
 ab ve mukhyamantri hai
 Along with honorarium teacher honorarium is also struggling for attention so that someone can pay attention to them
 in adhyayanon ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki bhashaai vishyon kii haalat sabase adhik karaab he
 In the name of Hindi and Sanskrit, the leaders make a riot in the city, fight north-south India, but Hindi and Sanskrit departments are running everywhere without professors

 University vice-chancellor Professor Harikesh Singh acknowledges that the university is in its silver jubilee year of its establishment and not a single building has been completed yet
 isi uniwarsity kaa ek college he rajendra college chhapra main he
 It is the historical college of Bihar which was established on the 1st of August, 1938
 chhapra ke banavaari laal ji ne agar apana ek bhawan, 20 bigha, 12 kattha or 11 dhur zamin na di hoti to yah college yahaan maujuud na hota
 Even today, this college is running in this building built before 1939
 banavaari laal shah ji kaa bhi apana alag hi itihaas he
 a book from Google search revealed, Communication and Colonialism in Eastern India: Bihar, 1760s-1880s, its author Nitin Sinha wrote that the British government asked the Collector of Saran to organize the court and he received the title of Shah Please provide a note
 banavaari laal ji kii khyaati hi is baat kii thi ki ve dharmashala, sarai ke liye kaaphi dhan-daulat or zamin daan main dete the
 He was a great merchant of Saran at that time and also controlled the trade through the river
 banavaari laal shah chhapra ke katra mohalla main rahete the
 He was not like the present-day Shah who sued for defamation of hundred crores
 shah banavaari laal ji ne kitna kuch daan kar diya, bagaiyr soche ki 21veen sadi kaa hindustan yaad bhi karegaa yaa nahin
 The history of a university or college is not about a class room alone
 wo shahar or uske samaaj kaa bhi itihaas hota he
 Therefore, while talking about Rajendra College Chapra, we started talking about Banwari Lal Shah
 1866 main chhapra nagarpalika kaa gathan ho chukaa tha
 In 1939, the then Municipal vice-president, Hariharsharan Ji, Dr
 rajendra prasad ke naam par college kholaa, tab rajendra prasad bharat ke pratham raashtrapati nahin bane the, bharat kii azaadi aath saal dur thi, lekin dow

 At that time there was a flood in Bihar and Rajendra Babu became very popular with his relief work
 us kaam ke sammaan main chhapra main rajendra prasad college khulaa
 His elder brother Mahendra Prasad also contributed to the urbanization of Chapra
 ek kahawat he ki mahendra nahin hote to rajend nahin hote
 All this information was given to us by Professor Lal Babu Yadav, Head of the Department of Political Science
 aaj us college main padhaane ke liye 157 professor-lekturer chahie, magar 33 prophessoron ke dam par hi college chal rahaa he
 There is no one to teach in Chemistry, Sanskrit, Urdu
 bhugol, hindi, commers main sirf ek-ek shikshak hai
 5000 students study in this college

 Someone will ask their leaders what they left out when they were not going to teach our children
 kya yahi kaaran he ki aaj uniwarsity se zyaada whats ap uniwarsity lokapriy he, professor se zyaada chaatr yaa yuva netaaon ke propeganda ko itihaas or vigyaan maan kar sweekaar kar rahe hai
 JP was born on October 11, but the death was on October 8, so between 8 and 11 October, programs are being conducted in this university about JP
 iske liye alag se bajet nahin aayaa he
 But every kind of competition is happening
 jepi ko yaad karne ke liye in chaatro ne kitni mehnat kii hogi, magar jinhen jepi ke naam par raaj mila he, unhone is uniwarsity ke liye kitni mehnat kii he
 Debate, essay writing competition is being organized
 yahi nahin jepi kii yaad main college main rojgaar mela bhi laga hua tha
 Make them unemployable without a professor and then organize employment fair among them

 The first year examination of the 2014-17 batch should have been held in 2015, 2017 has been held in June and the result is yet to come
 2015-18 or 2-16-19 batch kaa imtahaan kab hoga, kisi ko pataa nahin
 Why are these sessions late in university
 isliye hote hai taaki berojgaaron ko kuch saal vahiin campus main roak kar rakho
 Bihar's Education Minister should get a patent on how the session is late
 chhapra ke ramajaypal college ke itihaas vibhaag main paanch saal se ek bhi teacher nahin he
 Think what history these students must have read without a teacher for five years
 aajkal netaa subah-subah jayanti-punyatithi par yaad karne vaale card twit kar dete hai
 You might also wonder how much they respect their old leaders
 haal aap apni ankhon se dekh hi rahe hai
 The leader remembers for the vote
 1972 main gopalganj main mahila vishvavidhyalay kii sthapana hui
 Like the Vice Chancellor of JP University, the principal here also said that speak with my name

 Many principals started shivering as soon as the phone ran out, hiding their good name

 But Kiran ji is not like this
 unhone bataaya ki is college main 26 professor, lekturer hone chahie magar puure nahin hai

 There is a professor in Hindi who is about to retire

 There was no restoration for a long time

 There are around 960 students

 Principal Dr
 Kiran Kumari is continuously writing to the university but there is no hearing
 jab netaa kaa kaam murti banavaakar, jayanti manavaa kar chal hi jaataa he to skool-college main padhaane ke liye professor-teacher kyon rakhen

 We took the hall of the university built in memory of Jayaprakash Narayan
 ab ham dindalai upaadhyaay kii smriti main bane vishvavidhyalay kaa haal lenge
 Deen Dayal Upadhyay University, Gorakhpur
 1957 se gorakhpur uniwarsity chal rahi he
 This university was started with the efforts of Pandit SM Tripathi
 manhat digvijaynath kaa bhi yogadan tha, unheen kii parampara ke duusare uttaradhikari yogi adityanath uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri hai
 Looking at the photos, it seemed that the campus of Gorakhpur University is very bright and clean
 gorakhpur uniwarsity kaa naam dinadayal upaadhyaay gorakhpur uniwarsity he
 This campus has more than 16000 students
 har saal yahaan 5000 se adhik chaatr admician lete hai
 How many teachers come to this university campus, we are coming to that
 365 pad yahaan manzur hai magar 25 pad khaali hai
 This time the university has advertised for reinstatement, recruitment for about 212 posts has been released
 ummid he uniwarsity is samasya se mukti paa legi
 But what is the condition of the rest of the colleges associated with the university, we do not have complete information about how many recruitments have to be made there
 hamane apni report ke liye 2016-17 ke liye uniwarsity ke bajet patr kaa sahaara liya he
 Students here pay about 74 crores rupees to this university through various fees, but in return they get an empty class room
 bajet patr dekh kar pataa chal rahaa he ki kai jagahon par bhayankar katautee he
 Like the actual budget of the chemistry department in 2014-15 was more than 11 lakhs
 magar 2015-16 kaa anumaanit bajet 8 lakh kar diya gaya he
 Three lakhs have been deducted
 tippaniyan For how many years this university would have gone without teachers, what would have happened to those students
 unhen hi jab apni zindagi se matlab nahin to ham kitna pareshaan ho
 Nevertheless, Gorakhpur University hired adhoc from 1998 to 2003

 2006 main uniwarsity kii kaaryaparishad ne 2004 tak maandey par rakhe gaye shikshakon ko niyamit karne kaa prastaav paas kiya magar wo faisla lagu nahin hua

 Urdu is also similar to these
 vishvavidhyalay yaa college kaa itihaas akele class room kaa nahin hota he
 It also has a history of the city and its society
 isliye ham rajendra college chhapra kii baat karte-karte banavaari laal shah ji ke bare main baat karne lage
 The Chhapra Municipality was formed in 1866
 1939 main tatkaaleen nagarpalika ke upaadhyaksh hariharsharan ji ne dow
 The college opened in the name of Rajendra Prasad, when Rajendra Prasad did not become the first President of India, India's independence was eight years away, but Dr
 rajendra prasad ke naam par unke jiiteji college kaise bana
 It is also a history
 us vakt bihar main baadh ai thi or rajendra babu apane raahat ke kaam se kaaphi lokapriy ho gaye
 In honor of that work, Rajendra Prasad College opened in Chapra
 unke bade bhai mahendra prasad kaa bhi chhapra ke shaharikaran main yogadan tha
 There is a saying that if Mahendra were not there, Rajendra would not have been there
 yah sab jaankaree political science vibhaag ke pramukh professor laal babu yadav ne hamen di
 Today, 157 professors and lecturers are required to teach in that college, but the college is running on the strength of 33 professors
 chemistry, sanskrit, urdu main to koi padhaane vaala hi nahin he
 There are only one teacher each in Geography, Hindi, Commerce
 is college main 5000 chaatr padhate hai
 For two years, the government has not given money to this college
 fees nahin lene ke evaz main sarkaar ne apana hissaa nahin diya he
 The name of Rahul Sankrityayan is also associated with Rajendra College Chhapra
 hindi ke mahaan sahityakar shiv pujan sahay ji yaheen padhaate the
 Former Chief Minister Daroga Prasad Rai was a student of this place
 maharajaganj se bhaajapa saansad janardan sigrival yaheen ke chaatr the
 Manoranjan Sinha, who brought the beggar Thakur to the fore, was the principal of this college
 magar ab is college main padhaane vaala nahin he
 There is no name of study nor nomination
 150 computer hai lekin unhen chalaane ke liye computer oparator maatr ek he
 DAV College Siwan is 1941
 swargeey baidhnath prasad ji ne is college ko banwaaya tha
 Today there are only 27 professor-lecturers to teach 12,000 students
 ek shikshak par 444 chaatro kaa bhaar aata he
 There are no professors in Botany, Geography, Sanskrit
 57 pad hi manzur hai jisamen se 30 pad khaali hai
 It was told that the 18 professors who have retired, they are called only occasionally, whose money is not given, but they come and study
 bihar ke shiksha mantri kaam kya karte hai, ram jane
 There are few tools in science here in college, otherwise running classes without lab
 yah sirf hanikaarak nahin aparaadh bhi he
 All the Vice Chancellors we have talked to have met someone who is honestly saying his agony
 bataa rahaa he ki bina prayogshaala ke digriyaan di ja rahi hai
 This is not only harmful but also a crime
 koi apane netaaon se poochhega ki hamaare bacchon ko jab padhaane vaale nahin the, wo kya padhakar nikle
 Is this the reason that whats app university is more popular than university today, more students than professors or young leaders are accepting propaganda as history and science
 jepi kaa janm 11 aktubar ke din hua tha, magar maut 8 aktubar ko hui thi, isliye 8 se 11 oktober ke bich jepi ko lekar is uniwarsity main kaarykram kiye ja rahe hai
 There is no separate budget for this
 magar har tarah kii pratiyogita ho rahi he
 How hard these students must have worked to remember JP, but those who have got secret in jp's name, how hard they have worked for this university
 vaad-vivaad, niabandh lekhan pratiyogita kaa aayojan ho rahaa he
 Not only this, there was also an employment fair in the college in memory of JP
 bina professor ke inhen berojgaar hone laayak banaao or phir unke bich rojgaar mela bhi lagaao
 a picture of which shows that there is a special recruitment drive for the reinstatement of security guards
 matlab dhul jhonkne kaa isse acha udhaaharan kya ho saktaa he
 The 2013–16 batch is not finished until 2017
 yani seshan let he
 Second year examination was to be held in 2015, held in June 2017
 2014-17 batch ke pratham varsh kii pariksha 2015 main ho jaani chahie thi, 2017 june main hui he or abhi tak riselt nahin aayaa he
 No one knows when the test for 2015-18 and 2-16-19 batch will take place
 uniwarsity main ye seshan let kyon hote hai
 This is so that they keep the unemployed in the campus for a few years
 seshan let kaise hota he iskaa patent bihar ke shiksha mantri ko kara lenaa chahie
 There is not a single teacher in the history department of Ramjaypal College, Chapra for five years
 sochie, paanch saal tak bagair teacher ke in chaatro ne kya itihaas padhaa hoga
 Nowadays, leaders tweet memorizing cards in the early morning on the death anniversary
 aap bhi sochate honge ki ye apane puraane netaaon kaa kitna sammaan karte hai
 You are only seeing with your eyes
 netaa vot ke liye yaad karte hai
 In 1972, the Women's University was established in Gopalganj
 jepi uniwarsity ke vaais chancelar kii tarah yahaan kii principal ne bhi kaha ki meraa naam lekar bolie
 We appreciate Kiran Ji's courage
 bahut se principal to phone jate hi kaanpane lage, apana acha khaasaa naam chhipaane lage
 Crispy halls started to describe the condition of the college as if it is their number one college in India
 magar kiran ji aisi nahin hai
 He said that there should be 26 professors, lecturers in this college but they are not complete
 sanskrit
 There is no professor in History, Psychology, Political Science
 hindi main ek professor hai jo ritair hone vaali hai
 Many non-teaching seats are vacant
 arase se bahaali nahin hui
 There are no people to clean the college
 960 ke kareeb chaatra hai
 The building is in poor condition, it is a library but not a librarian
 prisimple dow kiran kumari lagaataar vishvavidhyalay ko likh rahi hai lekin koi sunwaayee nahin he
 When the work of the leader is done by getting the idol made and the birth anniversary celebrated, then why keep a professor-teacher to teach in school-college
 isi tarah mamrava kaa ek college he echaar college
 There are only 4 professors, there should be 17
 jaiprakash narayan kii smriti main bane vishvavidhyalay kaa haal hamane le liya
 Now we will take the condition of the university built in the memory of Deendalaya Upadhyay
 deen dayaal upaadhyaay uniwarsity, gorakhpur chalate hai
 Gorakhpur University has been functioning since 1957
 pandit esaem treepathi ke prayaason se yah uniwarsity shuru hui thi
 Mahant Digvijaynath also contributed, Yogi Adityanath, the second successor of his tradition, is the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh
 tasveeron ko dekh kar yahi laga ki gorakhpur uniwarsity kaa campus kaaphi chamakdaar or saaf-suthra he
 The name of Gorakhpur University is Deendayal Upadhyay Gorakhpur University
 is campus main 16000 se zyaada chaatr hai

 yahaan ke chaatr, tarah-tarah kii fees ke zarie is uniwarsity ko kareeb 74 karod rupee dete hai, magar badale main miltaa he khaali class room
 Seeing the budget paper, it is known that there are terrible cuts in many places
 jaise 2014-15 main rasayan shaastra vibhaag kaa vaastavik bajet tha 11 lakh se adhik tha
 But the estimated budget for 2015-16 has been increased to 8 lakhs
 teen lakh kii katautee ho gai he
 The comments kitne saal is uniwarsity main bagair shikshakon ke class chali hogi, un chaatro ke saath kya hua hoga
 When they do not mean to their lives, then how upset we are
 phir bhi gorakhpur uniwarsity ne 1998 se lekar 2003 tak edock par shikshak rakhe
 These are called honorarium teachers
 jo pehle 5000 prati maah kii selary par padhaate the jo baad main badhkar 8000 prati maah ho gaya
 In 2006, the University Executive Council passed a proposal to regularize honorarium teachers till 2004, but that decision did not apply
 2010 main uniwarsity ne 87 maandey shikshakon ko achaanak nikaal diya jabaki ye kam se kam 8 saal or adhik se adhik 15 saal tak padhaa chuke hai
 Now they are on the road

 Along with honorarium teacher honorarium is also struggling for attention so that someone can pay attention to them

 The 2013–16 batch is not finished until 2017

 2014-17 batch ke pratham varsh kii pariksha 2015 main ho jaani chahie thi, 2017 june main hui he or abhi tak riselt nahin aayaa he
 No one knows when the test for 2015-18 and 2-16-19 batch will take place
 uniwarsity main ye seshan let kyon hote hai
 This is so that they keep the unemployed in the campus for a few years
 seshan let kaise hota he iskaa patent bihar ke shiksha mantri ko kara lenaa chahie
 There is not a single teacher in the history department of Ramjaypal College, Chapra for five years

 Nowadays, leaders tweet memorizing cards in the early morning on the death anniversary

 He said that there should be 26 professors, lecturers in this college but they are not complete
 sanskrit
 There is no professor in History, Psychology, Political Science
 hindi main ek professor hai jo ritair hone vaali hai
 Many non-teaching seats are vacant
 arase se bahaali nahin hui
 There are no people to clean the college
 960 ke kareeb chaatra hai
 The building is in poor condition, it is a library but not a librarian
 prisimple dow kiran kumari lagaataar vishvavidhyalay ko likh rahi hai lekin koi sunwaayee nahin he
 When the work of the leader is done by getting the idol made and the birth anniversary celebrated, then why keep a professor-teacher to teach in school-college
 isi tarah mamrava kaa ek college he echaar college
 There are only 4 professors, there should be 17

 har saal yahaan 5000 se adhik chaatr admician lete hai
 How many teachers come to this university campus, we are coming to that
 365 pad yahaan manzur hai magar 25 pad khaali hai
 This time the university has advertised for reinstatement, recruitment for about 212 posts has been released
 ummid he uniwarsity is samasya se mukti paa legi
 But what is the condition of the rest of the colleges associated with the university, we do not have complete information about how many recruitments have to be made there
 hamane apni report ke liye 2016-17 ke liye uniwarsity ke bajet patr kaa sahaara liya he
 Students here pay about 74 crores rupees to this university through various fees, but in return they get an empty class room
 bajet patr dekh kar pataa chal rahaa he ki kai jagahon par bhayankar katautee he

 Three lakhs have been deducted

 2006 main uniwarsity kii kaaryaparishad ne 2004 tak maandey par rakhe gaye shikshakon ko niyamit karne kaa prastaav paas kiya magar wo faisla lagu nahin hua
 In 2010, the university suddenly fired 87 honorarium teachers, who have taught for at least 8 years and for more than 15 years

 Honorary teachers are struggling by forming associations
 2014 main saansad ke taur par yogi adityanath ne inke liye patr bhi likhaa tha

 apane raajnneetik virdohi ko nestnabud karnaa he to sabase acha rasta he ki use uske garh main jaakar maat di jaae
 This not only leads to the defeat of the adversary, but also completely breaks the spirits of his party workers
 congress ko 44 siton tak samet chuki bijepi ab uske bhavi adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke khilaaf isi ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he
 The motive is to beat Rahul in his stronghold Amethi so that Congressional spirits across the country are broken and PM Modi's dream of a Congress-free India can be realized
 amethi congress kaa kilaazadee ke baad congress ne anginat siton par chunaav ladaa or jeet yaa haar kaa swaad chakhaa lekin agar kisi ek seat kii baat kii jaae jahaan congress kaa ummidavaar matlab jeet kii guarantee he to wo seat upi ke avadh kii amethi hi he
 The Congress status on Amethi can be gauged from the fact that the Congress has won 13 out of the 15 Lok Sabha elections held so far
 haalanki amethi ko congress kaa garh kehane kii bajaay gandhi parivaar kaa garh kaha jaae to zyada sahi hoga kyonki jin 13 chunaavon main party ne is seat se jeet hasil kii he unamem se 9 baar yahaan ummidavaar gandhi parivaar se hi rahaa he
 sanjay-rajiv-sonia and Rahul Amethi became Lok Sabha seats in 1967
 iske baad yahaan 15 baar loksabhaa chunaav hue hai
 From here, Indira Gandhi's younger son Sanjay Gandhi contested and won elections in 1980
 unki asamyik maut ke baad rajeev gandhi 1981, 1984, 1989 main yahaan se vijeta ghoshit kiye gaye
 In 1991, Rajiv Gandhi won from here but after his death, Captain Satish Sharma was removed from here
 1999 main sonia gandhi ne amethi se chunaav ladakar raajnneeti main kadam rakhaa or jeet hasil kii
 In the next election i
e
 in 2004, Rahul Gandhi fought here and won
 2009 or 2014 main bhi rahul kii jeet kaa silsilaa jari rahaa
 In this stronghold of the Gandhi family, the BJP made a dent in the BJP that the posters of Congress leaders have started coming out from the walls of the houses here and Modi's calendars are showing on those same flaws
 shuruyaat 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav se hui jahaan sabko chaunkaate hue or raajnneetik paramparaon ke ulat piem modi ne rahul gandhi ke mukaable main smriti irani ko maidan main utaara
 Rahul Gandhi may have defeated Smriti Irani
 lekin smriti irani lagaataar amethi main sakriy hai
 He has visited Amethi 3 times in the last 6 months
 isse pehle bhi lagaataar wo amethi jaati rahi hai
 The impact of this exercise of BJP can be seen on Amethi land
 aaj khud bijepi adhyaksh amit shah, soochna prasaaran mantri smriti irani or uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne amethi main ek badi jansabha kii
 Needless to say that Rahul Gandhi was the target of the three leaders
 unhone vahaan 21 yojanaon kaa shilanyas athwa locarpan kiya
 The motive is to surround the Rahul and Gandhi families on the issue of development
 congress kaa darakta durgagandhi parivaar kaa garh hone ke baavjood amethi main vikaas kii wo dhara nahin bahi jo duusare bade netaaon ke ilaake main dekhne ko milti he( jaise mulaayam singh yadav kaa paitruk gaanv saifai) upi kaa ye shant or alpaviksit hissaa isi gumaan main khush rahata he ki wo desh ke sabase bade raajnneetik parivaar kii karmbhumi he

 amethi main kul paanch vidhansabha siten hai or maujuuda samay main ek bhi seat congress ke paas nahin he
 In the 2017 elections, BJP and SP had won 4 out of five seats in Amethi
 is tarah se 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon par najar daalen to paanch main se mahaj 2 seat congress ke paas thim or 3 siten sapa ke paas
 In the Congress stronghold, the BJP is constantly making a dent in the house of the gang
 amethi ke kai congressi netaa party chhodkar bijepi or duusari partiyon kaa daaman tham chuke hai
 Among them, Dr
 Muslim, who was an MLA from Tiloi Assembly in Amethi region, joined the BSP and Dr
 Rajya Sabha member of the Congress
 sanjay singh kii pehali patni garima singh or bete aanant vikram singh bijepi kaa daaman thama
 Garima Singh is currently an MLA from Amethi
 mangalavar ko congressi netaa jang bahadur singh ne bhi bijepi kaa daaman tham liya
 During the assembly elections, sp's Mayeshwar Sharan Singh joined the BJP and also won from Tiloi
 isi tarah salon ke bispi netaa rahe dalbahadur kori ne bhi chunaav ke dauraan bijepi main ghar vaapasi kii or salon vidhansabha se vidhayak hai
 It is clear that these leaders do not see their future in the Congress now

 uttar pradesh main sapa or basapa gathbandhan karke loksabhaa chunaav ke siyaasi maidan main utre hai
 However, SP President Akhilesh Yadav's father and party mentor Mulayam Singh Yadav has imposed such a veto power, which has entangled the Jaunpur and Ballia seats of Purvanchal
 akhilesh or mayawati, donon kii ulajhane bad gai he
 Due to this, the coalition is unable to take a decision on the candidates in Jaunpur and Ballia seats
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan main jonpur seat basapa or baliya seat sapa ke khate main gai he
 In such a situation, the BSP has not yet decided on the candidature from Jaunpur
 jabaki, sapa baliya se purv piem chandrashekhar ke bete niraj shekhar ko chunavi maidan main utaarne kii taiyaari kar rahi thi
 The BJP has cut the ticket of sitting MP Bharat Singh
 ab bharat singh ne bagawati rukh akhriyaar kiya he
 In such a situation, the SP seems confident about winning this seat
 sutron kii maane to sapa-basapa gathbandhan se naakhush mulaayam singh ne jonpur seat par apane kareebi or purv saansad parasnath yadav ko chunaav ladaana chaahate hai
 In such a situation, he has extended his name to SP President Akhilesh Yadav to make Parasnath Yadav a candidate by putting his veto power
 isse akhilesh uljhan main pad gaye hai
 In the 2017 assembly elections, Mulayam Singh went to Jaswantnagar for Shivpal Yadav and Parasnath Yadav in Malhani seat in Jaunpur
 akhilesh pehle hi sanbhal loksabhaa seat par mulaayam singh ke dwaara badaye gaye aparnaa yadav ke naam ko darkinar karte hue shafikurrahman bark ko ummidavaar ghoshit kar chuke hai
 As a result, Mulayam Singh openly criticized the decision to tie up with the BSP
 vahiin, ab agar jonpur seat par bhi agar mulaayam ke sujhaaye gaye naam ko nazarandaaj karte hai to unki naaraazgi bad sakati he
 However, the Jaunpur seat is in the bsp's account
 aise main akhilesh ne basapa adhyaksh mayawati se jonpur seat sapa ke liye chhodane kaa anurodh kiya
 According to sources, on this Mayawati clearly said that the Jaunpur seat can be left in the same condition that the SP should give Ballia seat instead
 jabaki, akhilesh baliya seat nahin chhodana chaahate
 They are trying to give another seat instead, but the BSP president is not agreeing on this
 isi ke chalate abhi tak in donon siton par donon partiyaan apane ummidavaaro ko lekar koi faisla nahin le paa rahi hai
 Mulayam Singh Yadav's politics is like the rain of the mountains which can rain anytime and anywhere
 isamen badlaav antim faislon ke baad bhi ho jate hai
 But at the moment the Samajwadi Party stands at the mouth of politics, the way of withdrawal from there is reduced
 vaapasi kisi ke liye bhalee bhi nahin he
 Neither for Akhilesh nor Mulayam Singh Yadav
 kyonki jo nuksaan ab party ko ho chukaa he uski bharpai kisi bhi meljol se hone vaali nahin he
 Rather more damning
 lekin is puure ghatnakram main sabase zyaada phayda agar kisi ko ho saktaa he or kisi ke liye agar yahaan se sakaaratmak gunjaaish banati nazar aa rahi he to wo he bhartiya janata party
 The Bharatiya Janata Party is describing this whole incident as an internal matter of the SP and demanding resignation, citing instability
 bhaajapa pravaktaaon ne sapa keantarkalah kii barishmen vikaas kaa raag gaanaa shuru kar diya he
 The intent behind this is also clearly understood
 dusron kii kamazori kaa laabhdrasal, akhilesh jis taiyaari ke saath chunaav ko aage lekar bade the wo sapa ke liye ek acha sanket tha
 Well because on the lines of Bihar, alliances of SP, Congress and some other political parties were going to emerge as a strong alternative to stop BJP in the state
 is gathjod se modi or mayawati donon hi baichaiyn the
 Modi was because this alliance had the possibility of recurrence of Bihar and Mayawati was because her dalit-muslim votebank chemistry of this time was seen to fail after this alliance
 ab jabaki asthirataaon ke badalon ne soobe ko dhak liya he, bhaajapa kamazor padati kshetreey partiyon ke bich khud ko ek sthai or behatar vikalp ke taur par prastut karnaa chaahegi
 Mulayam Singh Yadav's press conference was certainly a good announcement for the BJP, concerned with the use of the Grand Alliance
 mayawati keval dalit-muslim votbank ke sahare bahut dur tak khilne kii sthiti main nahin hai
 Due to their weakness, a section of Dalits may also be attracted to BJP through slogans like Stability and Hindutva
 kyon phaayde main he bhaajapaudhar akhilesh or mulaayam agar maidan main akbar or saleem kii tarah bhidane ke liye khadey ho gaye to ek duusare ke vot kaatane ke alaava ye kahin tak pahunch paane kii sthiti main philhal nahin dikhte
 Two parties can take direct advantage of this political anarchy
 ek congress or duusari bhaajapa
 But the Congress itself is like a party running on dialysis and for that this opportunity is far away
 isliye is trikonmiti main sabase zyaada laabh philvakt bhaajapa ko hi hota nazar aa rahaa he or wo ise bhunaane se chukenge nahin
 The party, which has done its part on demonetisation, will now make the fight for instability and clan its mantra and ask for votes with slogans like stability and development
 haalanki sapa or mulaayam behate hue pani jaisi raajnneeti ke liye jane jate hai or koi bhi tasviir antim nahin hoti
 But how the BJP missed out on capitalizing the damage done to the SP
 sapa kii ladaai soobe main bhaajapa ke liye achche din kaa sanket hai
 Ministers in UP have also jumped into it to capitalize on the public support being given by ministers of the AAP government in Delhi to set an example of simplicity

 He knew that his mother always kept money in a tin box under the bed
 beeti may main uski maa kaa dehanth ho gaya
 Pankaj (name changed like other juvenile criminals present here) needed money for cannabis, smacks and hashish

 At the age of 16, he left school and lived in the streets of Karol Bagh market with his friends

 Even though there are provisions in the existing law which deal with the early rescue, treatment, rehabilitation, improvement and integration of child criminals, the methods of how to do so are completely missing

 Two - those who believe that demonetisation was not necessary

 Ashwini Iyer, director of Nil Batte Sannata, has crossed the fleet of mathematics by quite a ruckus
 unke pita professor or maa skool main bhugol kii teacher principal rahi hai
 Her husband Nitesh Tiwari's father has been an education officer and along with him Nitesh has got the opportunity to experience the experiences of schools and education system in Madhya Pradesh
 nitesh itarasi ke hai or ai ai tii bombai ke chaatr rahe hai
 He must have been quick in mathematics
 is film kii team kaa sarkari schuli vyavastha se kisi na kisi tarah kaa naata rahaa he
 Among those who wrote its story, Pranjal Chaudhary hails from Indore and is an engineer
 niraj singh bihar ke supaul ke hai or em bi e ke chaatr rahe hai
 Both of these advertisements came into the world and together with Ashwini wrote the screen play of the film in a year
 vah bhi naukari karte hue, shanivaar ravivaar kii chhuttiyon main
 That is when the film captures the fun between the fear and fear of mathematics
 iske kirdaar apeksha, sweety or pintu ganit ke maare to hai lekin mar nahin gaye hai
 He is a lively student
 masti karte hai or unki maa chanda sahay yani swara bhaskar kii maa ir bhaskar jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay main professor hai
 Father c Udaya Bhaskar is a famous defense expert
 udai bhaskar kaa sambandh hyderabad se rahaa he
 Swara told that she too had a goal in maths
 swara ne bhi chanda sahay kii bhoomika main jaan daal di he
 Lyricist Manoj Yadav hails from Mau, Uttar Pradesh
 film ke team kii detail bataati he ki koi ganit main gol tha to koi ganit main teerandaz
 This film has become a form of herb to face the fear of mathematics
 ashvini ayyar ne bataaya ki unke bheetar bhi ganit kaa dar rahata he isliye jab ve basket ball ke court main ek seen shoot kar rahi thim to pataa hi nahin chal rahaa tha ki seen ganit ke hisaab se sahi he yaa galat
 This is the same scene when Appu asks Expectation why the maths is so difficult then Amar makes a circle and starts explaining
 khel khel main ganit ko aasaan bana detaa he
 The comments main is film par doosraa lekh likh rahaa hum
 i think this film is made on me or talks like me
 mere jaisai matlab jo ganit main kamazor hai, jinhen ganit se dar lagata rahaa he
 Tyagi Ji, a philanthropist from Bulandshahar, says that you do something about mathematics
 yah ganit kaa dar samaaj main bacchon ko apradhi bana rahaa he
 Not only this, there is a prayer in the film - give us so much power - this is the prayer we used to sing in school
 dekh lijie, pataa chalaa ki sabko lagane laga ki is film ne unke jivan kii kahani chura lee
 Told everyone about their fear
 ganit par jitani baat ho, kam he
 Good thing this film is like a film
 to kai darpokon ne milakar ek film banaai he, nil bate sannata taaki ganit ke dar ko jeeta ja sake
 Those who have been failing can see themselves to fail one more time, do they know that they have come to believe that they will pass this time
 chalo maths kaa hi dabba gol karte hai
 How long Maths will make our box
 tabhi yah film ganit ke bhay or bhay ke bich kii masti ko pakad paati he

 is daure main vah mejabaan team ke khilaaf teen test maichon kii siries khelegi
 From the pitches here, only time will tell how much help Indian spin bowlers Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja will get
 lekin un donon ke liye ab tak ke aankade utane utsahjanak nahin hai
 African soil is a graveyard for spinners, what will ashwin-jadeja do? There was a period when Shane Warne (61 wickets in 12 matches in South Africa), Anil Kumble (45 wickets in 12 matches) and Muttiah Muralitharan (35 wickets in 6 matches) ) Like spinners in South Africa also spread the magic of their ball, but after this there was no such spinner who made his dominance there
 yahaan tak ki dakshin africa bhi paal adams (19 maichon main 57 wicket), paul haris (18 maichon main 48 wicket) or niki boe (22 maichon main 35 wicket) jaise kuch spinner hi paidaa kar paaya
 He now has Keshav Maharaj, who has taken 20 wickets in five Tests on his soil
 aswin ko africa dharti par apane viketon kaa khaataa kholana habharat ke vartmaan spinneron aswin or jadeja ko dakshin africa sarajameen par ek- ek test match khilne kaa mauka mila he
 Jadeja took 6 wickets in a match, but Ashwin has yet to open his account in this country
 bharat ke pichley daure main johanisburg test main 42 over karne ke baavjood aswin ko wicket nahin mila tha
 D
 africa main bharat ne 17 test maichon main 13 spinneron ko utaara haidakshin africa main bhartiya spinneron ke pradarshan par gaur karen, to bharat ne ab tak vahaan jo 17 test match khele hai unamem 13 spinneron kaa upyog kiya, jinhone kul 81 wicket liye, jo ki bhartiya gendbaajon ko mili kul viketon (166 wicket) kaa 32
 80 percent
 uske alaava upmahadweep kii do anya tiimon srilanka (40
 25 percent) and Pakistan (33
 95 pratishat) ke spinneron ko hi dakshin africa main thodi acchhee safalataa mili
 
 
 But India has shown greater confidence in the fast bowlers, although India has made the most use of their spinners on South African soil
 bharat ne 17 maichon main lagbhag 39 pratishat (1202
 4 overs) got bowling done by spinners, but that too was more than most fast bowlers and he 1871
 4 over tej gendbaajon se karwaae
 Therefore, it is certain that Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Shami, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jaspreet Bumrah will have to play an important role in the next three matches
 spinneron ne wicket ke liye ausatan 14
 Indian fast bowlers waited 11 overs in South Africa for 84 overs
 27 over main ek wicket hasil kiya, jabaki spinneron ko iske liye ausatan 14
 Had to wait till 84 overs
 yah alag baat he ki spinneron ne 21
 He also put pressure on the batsmen by making 46 percent overs
 tej gendbaaj 19
 He was able to make only 02 percent overs
 bharat ke baad dakshin africa sarajameen par srilanka (38
 38), Bangladesh (38
 29) or pakistan (35
 66 per cent) used their spinners, but England, New Zealand, West Indies and Australia showed great confidence in their fast bowlers
 capatoun ke newlands main spinneron ko thodaa madad milti rahi heis daure main bharat ko captan, centurian or johanisburg main match khilne hai
 Of these, the spinners have been of little help at Newlands in Cape Town, where they have 84 wickets in 12 matches in their last 10 years
 is bich haalanki tej gendbaajon ne is maidan par 274 wicket liye
 The spinners took 43 wickets from nine matches at Centurion and 30 from seven matches at Johannesburg over the years, while the pace bowlers took 222 and 201 wickets respectively at the same grounds

 Students protested on hostel fees at Jawaharlal Nehru University on Friday, protesting against police timings with hostel fees, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), located in Delhi, Delhi, to raise hostel fees and change timings Face to face
 somvaar ko chaatr campus main pradarshan karne utre or dilli police se unki bheeshan bhidnt ho gai thi
 The police showered water on the students, there was also shocks but the students remained adamant on their performance and demands
 somvaar ko uniwarsity main dikshant samaaroh bhi chal rahaa tha, jisamen kendriya mantri ramesh pokharial pahunche the lekin baahar chaatro ne aakraamak pradarshan shuru kar diya
 Due to which the minister remained trapped for several hours
 get ke baahar pradarshan kar rahe chaatro kii maang thi ki jabatak uniwarsity kulapati saamne nahin aate hai tabatak vah pradarshan band nahin karenge
 Why are the students protesting? The students allege that the JNU administration has increased hostel fees significantly, as well as the timing of hostels have been changed
 jeenyu prashasan ne apane haalia nirdeshon main chatravaas, mess or suraksha fees main 400 pratishat kii vruddhi kii he
 Along with this, the new instruction has also limited the time to visit the hostel
 chaatro ke aarope ke anusaar hostel fees main ye vruddhi hui he
 
 
 - Single seater hostel: Earlier room rent was Rs 20, but now Rs 600- Double seater hostel: Earlier room rent was Rs 10, but now Rs 300 - Electricity-free water before, but now the talk of charging- Rs 1700 service charge separately

 There was also political rhetoric on the performance of JNU students and many leaders Not voiced support for students

 In the wake of Delhi University Students' Union elections, NSUI has started the exercise to woo freshers
 isi kadi main enesayuai ne somvaar ko uniwarsity cultural fest kaa aayojan kiya
 Many famous singers were invited to this NSUI Fest held at Talkatora Stadium
 stadium ke andar jahaan musical sho ke jariye enesayuai feshars ko anterten kar rahi thi, to vahiin stadium ke baahar dusu ke niyamon kii dhajjiyaan udayi ja rahi thim
 Both these photos are from nnui's Cultural Fest
 wo cultural fest jo diu main dusu ke dangal par haaavee hote baahubal or dhanabal kii jhalak dikhaata he
 This is just the beginning
 lekin dusu chunaav jeetne ke liye vot batorne kaa ye tarika diu main kaaphi purana he
 Last year CYSS tried to woo freshers through rock shows, and this year NNUI is trying to convert freshers into votes on the pretext of such a cultural show
 cultural festke bahaane vot jutaney kii kavayadenesyuai ke is kaarykram main jogiya khali bali fame punjabi singer bhuppi ne kai hit number gaakar freshars ko anterten kiya to vahiin raper faisalpuria ke ladki beautiphul jaise gaanon par stadium main baitha har chaatr jhuumane laga
 The fest was attended by artists like Jasbinder Jassi, Dilbag Singh, Sanam Singh and comedian Darcy Bharadia
 enesayuai ke is fest main shaamil hone vaale zyaadaatar chaatr freshars the
 Who enjoyed the performance of everyone from pop singers to rappers and gave a lot of fun
 sakshi malik ne badhaayaa hausalaolampic main kaansya padak hasil kar desh kaa naam roshan karne vaali sakshi malik bhi enesayuai ke fest main shaamil hui
 While NSUI honored Sakshi Malik with a memento, the same Sakshi encouraged all the students
 fest main toote dusu ke niyam-kaayadestadium ke andar enesayuai kaa cultural fest puure shabaab par tha to stadium ke baahar sambhavit ummidavaaron ke naamon kii parchiyaan jameen par bikhrin padi thim
 The convoy of cars was also equipped with posters and potential candidates were also promoting themselves through cartoon characters
 jo ki sidhe sidhedusu chunaav kii guidelinska ulghanghan he
 However, NSUI is trying to avoid it by calling it the enthusiasm of activists and students
 enesayuai kii rashtriya adhyaksh amrutha dhawan ke mutabik abhi ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa nahin kii gai he lihaaza aksar chaatr yaa kaaryakarta josh or utsaah main aakar aisa kar dete hai
 But NSUI is completely in favor of paper-free elections, although DU should offer options like the Wall of Democracy in college so that the candidate can campaign
 enesayuai ke is fest ko abivipi dhanabal or baahubal kaa pradarshan bataa rahi he
 According to ABVP national media convenor Saket Bahuguna, NSUI only tries to buy size students at the time of elections but DU students have now identified them
 chaatr jaanate hai ki campus main ground par puure saal abivipi hi kaam karti he
 That is why such a fest does not matter
 abivipi is dhanabal or baahubal ko parajeet kar chaaron siten phir se jeetegi
 The same NSUI is calling it a fest organized to welcome freshers, not a game of money and muscle power
 ye or baat he ki puure karbokram main yaa binar-postaron main kahin bhi welcome program kaa zikr nahin kiya gaya
 Well, given the DUSU election, how successful NSUI was in this exercise to woo freshers will be known only after the election
 darasal pichley teen saalon se dusu par abivipi kaa kabja rahaa he, lihaaja is saal enesayuai apni saakh bachaae rakhane ke liye dusu chunaav har haal main jeetna chaahegi
 This is the reason why Congress leaders and mps like Dependra Hooda, Oscar Fernandes and Yoganand Shastri were also seen attending the fest and appealed to join NSUI

 input: bhashaa After being immersed in the mother's siren idol, her strength, her devotion, the time has come to get a Mahafal of worship
 is baar maa ke mahayajna main aakhri aahuti daal, maa ke saamne hriday kholkar rakh dijiega
 On Saturday, share your wishes, your dreams with your mother
 kyonki yahi wo din he jab aapaki tapasya rang laaegi or manachaaha fal milegaa
 'durgashtami' is the most important Navratri of Shakti Puja, the day of worship of Maa Mahagauri and also the day of concluding the rituals of worshiping Navratri by worshiping Kanjak
 nau din se vrath rakhkar shakti kii upasna karne vaale bhakton main kuch log ashtami ko to kuch log navami ko apane vrath kaa samaapan karte hai
 It is said that whoever succeeds in getting the blessings of a devout mother does not take long to fill his bag
 agar ashtami ke din kii baat karen to is baar ashtami shanivaar ko aa rahi he shuruyaat purvasadha nakshatra main hogi, lekin subah 7 bajkar 48 minute par uttarasadha nakshatra aarambh ho jayega
 The worship of Bhagwati in both these Nakshatras can prove to be a spark to the lives of devotees
 andhere se chhutkaaraa dilaane vaali sabit ho sakati he
 On this day Gajakesari Yoga is also being created, due to which if you are struggling with money related problems, then the time has come to end your troubles
 bhagwati ke saath pile dhaatu ke bane shriyantra kii puja sone par suhaaga kii sthiti banaaegi or jaatakon ke liye aarthik stroton kii raah khol degi
 Ashtami of this nakshatra helps the devotees to get the desired life partner, while at the same time providing healthy life
 agar aap santan sukh se vanchit hai yaa phir santan kii chintaa aapako sata rahi he to santan sambandhi samast samasyaon se mukti milegi or raah se sabhi rode hat jaaenge
 Due to coming on Saturday, if the people recite the third character of Suktam and Durga Saptashati on the night of Ashtami, for the next 151 days continuously, the people suffering the effects of half-century will get a sigh of relief
 jahaan ek taraf nae kaam, vyapaar ke shuru karne kaa yoga banegaa, vahiin duba yaa rukaa hua dhan paane kii raah khulegi
 On Ashtami, the importance of worshiping the mother is as much as Kanjak worship, that is, worship of the girl
 ye manyata he ki kanya pujan se maa bahut jaldi prasann ho jaati hai or bhakton ko kalyaan karti hai
 While going inside a temple near Bangalore, a child was badly beaten up
 bachche kaa 'kasoor' bas itnaa tha ki vah dalit samudaay kaa he

 Seeing Prasad splitting, Santosh followed Pandit to the sanctum sanctorum of the temple
 isi baat se naaraaz hokar pujari ne bachche kii buree tarah pitayee kar di
 When the child returned to his home, the parents were saddened to see blood pouring from his forehead
 jab ve shikaayat karne mandir pahunche, to pujaariyon ne uske mata-pita se kaha ki ve is ghatana ko bhul jaaen
 It is being told that the people of the temple took thumbprints of his parents on plain paper, so that any further action could be avoided
 vaise dakshin bharat ke zyaadaatar mandiron main jahaan murtiyon rakhi hoti hai, vahaan aam taur par keval pujari hi jate hai
 However, the Dalit Sangharsh Samiti has taken it seriously after the incident came to light

 Violence has erupted in Punjab and Haryana after Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim was convicted in a sexual abuse case
 halaak bekaabu hote ja rahe hai
 Eleven people have died so far in the orgy of Dera supporters
 media karmiyon par dhardaar hathiyaaron se hamale kiye ja rahe hai
 Curfew has been imposed in many areas of both states
 aise main sawaal ye he ki is sthiti ke liye koun jimmedaar he
 By Thursday night, Haryana DGP BS Sandhu was pleading for complete security and security

 People are being let go only after investigation
 lekin sawaal ye he agar itani taiyaari thi ki deraa samarthakon ke paas se dhardaar hathiyaar kahaan se mil rahe hai
 Where did the weapons come to the Dera supporters to attack the people
 suraksha ke sawaal par sandhu ne kaha tha ki sthiti puri tarah niyantran main he
 In addition to the police force, a large number of personnel of the central forces have reached Panchkula and have been deployed
 adaalat ke aasapaas ke ilaake main kisi ko jane kii anumati nahin di jaaegi or keval unhen hi jane diya jayega jinaki vahaan zarurat he
 He said that curfew has been implemented in Sirsa city and three nearby villages but no such decision has been taken so far for Panchkula
 yah poochne par ki agar deraa samarthakon ne vahaan se jane se manaa kar diya to is par sandhu ne kaha, ham kisi bhi sthiti se nipatane main sakasham or uske liye taiyaar hai
 He said that Haryana Police personnel have seized umbrellas and other items from some Dera supporters gathered in Panchkula
 unhone kaha, hamane unki jaanch kii
 They do not have sticks
 hamane chaate jabt kar liye hai or un bason or vaahanon ko apane kabje main le liya he jinase ve yahaan pahunche the
 On one question, he said that the security forces personnel will convince the Dera supporters that they will have to follow the orders of the High Court
 sandhu ne kaha, ham mahilaon or bacchon or bujurgon se nipat rahe hai
 We have enough policemen including women to deal with them
 haryana ke purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ne rajya sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki panchakula main halaat bighad rahe hai or agar haryana sarkaar pehle se taiyaar rahati to ye naubat nahin aati
 Hooda has said that at the moment he will not comment much on the government and this time it is most important to be normal
 aise main sawaal ye he ki itani bade paimaane par ho rahi hinsa kaa dijipi ko andaja nahin the
 After all, why did the administration give so much opportunity to the Dera supporters
 unhen kyon ikattha hone diya gaya
 What responsibility will the DGP take for the violence spread in the state
 bataa den ki court ne police or prashasan ko nirdesh dete hue kaha tha ki agar kisi bhi tarah kii hinsa hoti he, to prashasan turant ection le or updraviyon se nipatane main sankoch na kare

 duniya ko hilaa kar rakh dene vaale sharnaarthi sankat ko yudhgrast syria ke logon ke europe main pravesh karne kii koshish ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya
 But the number of people who are trying to enter western countries is very less
 lakhon logon main se 10 fisadi se bhi kam log europe pahunch pate hai, baakiyon kii pahunch se pashchimi desh dur hi hai
 This week, a special series on migration on NDTV, under which we tried to find the invisible roots of the refugee crisis
 pesh he is shrunkhlaa kii pehali kadi syria-turki ke border se
 
 
 We met a 12-year-old Gemjin in a city located at one end of a war-torn country
 syria kii seemaa se kuch mile kii duuri par sthit turki ke dhul bhare shahar suruk kii ek kapade kii dukaan main almariyon ko vyavasthit karata jemagin cobain kaa rahane vaala he
 Cobain, which is on the Syrian border, is the same city where ISIS has been in possession since October 2014, following heavy massacres and the exodus of thousands
 jemalin kaa parivaar bhi un lakhon syrian sharnaarthiyon main shaamil he jo turki main sharan liye hue hai
 Many of these families are extremely poor
 hafte main 6 din 8 ghante kii kadi mashkkat ke baad jemagin kareeb 20 turkish lira hi kama paata he yani hafte main 10 dollar se bhi kam
 He told us that he remembers his school at Cobain where he also learned science, mathematics and history, although the options were few
 sadak ke us taraf, ek choti si silaai dukaan main hamen mohammad mila, vah bhi jemagin kii tarah hi cobain kaa he or ab skool nahin ja paata
 The 13-year-old has now learned a new job; he now stitches the curtains that are sold in the local market
 mohammad har din 8-10 ghante kaam karata he or use bhi utane hi paise milte hai jitne jemagin ko
 a 13-year-old Khalid was found nearby, although he looked a bit older in age
 khalid ne ambroidari mashin chalaanaa sikh liya he
 He told us that he has been working in this shop for the last three years, that is, he started working from the age of 10
 apane anubhav ke chalate khalid kuch zyada paise kama letaa he, yani hafte main 20 se 50 lira tak
 Khalid and the other two are not alone
 suruk ke bazaaron main cobain ke bachche har taraf mil jaaenge, gulaamon jaisi mazdooree ke liye ghanton kadi mashkkat karte hue
 Their employers say that children are getting reasonable money
 mohammad ke niyokta ne bataaya ki suruk koi amir shahar to he nahin or wo jo paise de rahe hai wo paryaapt he
 But the minimum wage in Turkey is 1000 lira per week and children are hardly getting 2% of it
 jabaki bal mazdooree gaiyr kanoonee he
 Some children told us that there is no suitable school for Syrian children in Turkey
 padhai kaa madhyam yaa to turki bhashaa he yaa phir angreji, bacchon ko arabi aati he isliye wo turki yaa angreji samaj nahin pate
 It was in Suruk's neighborhood that we met Khalid's parents
 unki kahani behad daraavnee he
 They lived in Raqqa, Syria
 aies ne cobain par kabje se pehle rakka ko hi apni rajdhani bana rahaa tha
 Khalid's father Mustafa, a plumber by profession, said that he had no choice but to get his son to work
 jis kaam ke liye turki ke kisi plumber ko 700 lira milte hai, vahiin mujhe usee kaam ke liye keval 400 lira hi milte hai
 Mustafa is battling to raise his family
 parivaar main patni or 4 bachche hai jinamein khalid sabase bada he
 Pointing to Khalid's younger brother's t-shirt, his mother said that he had bought it from Syria three years ago
 unhone bataaya, 'ham nae kapade kharidne main samarth nahin hai
 ' turki ne apni taraf se kareeb 25 lakh syrian sharnaarthiyon kii dekharekh ke liye 7 arab dollar kharch kiye hai
 The Syrian war has forced about 4 million people to leave the country
 keval 10 fisadi log hi pashchimi deshon tak pahunch pate hai, jabaki ye kaha jaataa ki europe syria sharnaarthiyon se bhar gaya he
 Turkey is displeased with this
 asamanta kii is baat ko maanate hue pichley hafte brusselles main europe ke netaaon kii ek baithak hui jisamen syrian sharnaarthiyon ke liye turki dwaara kiye ja rahe prayaason ke liye zyada fund kii vyavastha karne par charchaa hui
 But Shabnam Akapar, who teaches at South Asian University in New Delhi, says that all the promises that are being made are far from reality
 unhone bataaya ki turki ko antarrashtriya samudaay se ab tak keval 4,17000 dollar hi praapt hue hai
 Khalid's parents and others like him are not able to reach Europe
 jab hamane cobain main syrian seemaa tak yatra kii to paaya ki jo log rah gaye hai wo bhi nikat bhavishya main apane gharon ko nahin laut sakenge
 The city is now again under the control of the Kurds who are fighting the IS and Bashar al Assad's forces together, although a large part of the city has been destroyed
 tippaniyan Like Khalid, Muhammad and Jemgin, the three-year-old Aylan Kurdi, a child who stunned the coast of western Turkey, whose picture shook the world, was also from Cobain
 uske parivaar ne acchhee jindagi kii ummid main use dur le jane kii koshish kii thi lekin uski naav turki or greece ke bich agian sagar main dub gai
 But in the markets of Suruk, we found that life is not easy for the refugees here, especially for the children
 yuddh se trast desh ke ek chor par based ek shahar main hamaari mulaakaat 12 saal ke jemagin se hui
 Jemjin is a resident of Cobain, who arranges shelves in a clothes shop in the Turkish dusty city of Suruk, a few miles from the Syrian border
 syria kii seemaa par sthit cobain vahi shahar he jahaan baari narsanhaar or hajaaron logon ke palaayan ke baad oktober 2014 se hi iesas kaa kabja he
 Jemlin's family is also among the millions of Syrian refugees who have taken refuge in Turkey
 inamen se bahut se parivaar behad garib hai
 After 8 hours of hard work 6 days a week, Gemjin earns about 20 Turkish lira, which is less than $ 10 a week
 usne hamen bataaya ki use cobain main apane skool kii yaad aati he jahaan usne vigyaan, ganit or itihaas bhi siikhaa, haalanki vikalp kam hi the
 On the side of the road, in a small sewing shop we found a mosaic that is like Cobain's, and is no longer able to go to school
 13 saal ke mohammad ne ab ek nayaa kaam sikh liya he, vah ab pardon kii silaai karata he jo sthaneey bazaar main bikate hai
 Mohammed works for 8-10 hours every day and he gets the same amount of money as Gemjin
 paas hi main 13 saal kaa khalid mila, haalanki wo umr main thodaa bada lag rahaa tha
 Khalid has learned to operate an embroidery machine
 usne hamen bataaya ki vah pichley teen saal se is dukaan main kaam kar rahaa he yani usne 10 saal kii umr se hi kaam karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 Due to his experience, Khalid earns more money, ie 20 to 50 lira a week
 khalid or baaki do hi akele nahin hai
 Cobain's children would be found everywhere in Suruk's markets, spending hours working hard for slave-like wages
 unke niyoktaaon kaa kahana he ki bacchon ko vaazib paise mil rahe hai
 Mohammad's employer said that Suruk is not a wealthy city and the money he is paying is sufficient
 lekin turki main nunatam mazdooree 1000 lira prati saptaah he or bacchon ko uskaa 2 fisadi bhi mushkil se hi mil paa rahaa he
 While child labor is illegal
 kuch bacchon ne hamen bataaya ki turki main syrian bacchon ke liye koi makul skool nahin he
 The medium of study is either Turkish language or English, children know Arabic so they do not understand Turkish or English
 suruk ke pados main hi ham khalid ke mata-pita se mili
 His story is extremely scary
 wo log syria ke rakka main rahete the
 IS was making Raqqa its capital before it took possession of Cobain
 khalid ke pita mustafa jo ki peshey se plumber hai, ne bataaya ki unke paas bete se kaam karwaane ke alaava koi chaara nahin tha
 For the work for which a Turkish plumber gets 700 lira, i only get 400 lira for the same work
 mustafa apane parivaar ko paalane ke liye jujh rahe hai
 The family consists of a wife and 4 children, Khalid being the eldest
 khalid ke chote bhai kii tishart kii ore ishaara karte hue unki maa ne bataaya ki ye tishart unhone use teen saal pehle syria se kharida tha
 He said, 'we are not able to buy new clothes
 ' Turkey has spent $ 7 billion on its behalf to care for about 2
5 million Syrian refugees
 syrian yuddh ne kareeb 40 lakh logon ko desh chhodane par majaboor kar diya he
 Only 10 per cent of the people are able to reach the western countries, while it is said that Europe is filled with refugees from Syria
 is baat se turki ko naaraazgi he
 Recognizing this inequality, there was a meeting of European leaders in Brussels last week to discuss the provision of more funds for the efforts being made by Turkey for Syrian refugees
 lekin nai dilli sthit south asian uniwarsity main padhaane vaali shabnam akapar kahati hai ki jitne bhi vaade kiye ja rahe hai wo hakeekat se dur hai
 He said that Turkey has so far received only $ 4,17000 from the international community
 khalid ke mata-pita or unke jaise duusare log europe tak pahunchane main samarth nahin hai
 When we traveled to the Syrian border in Cobain, we found that even those who are left will not be able to return to their homes in the near future
 shahar par ab phir se kurdon kaa niyantran he jo aies or bashar al asad kii sena se ek saath lard rahe hai, haalanki shahar kaa bada hissaa tabah ho chukaa he
 The comments khalid, mohammad or jemagin kii tarah hi teen saal kaa ylaan kurdi, pashchimi turki ke samudr tat par achet padaa vahi baccha jisaki tasviir ne duniya ko hilaa kar rakh diya tha, wo bhi cobain se hi tha
 His family had tried to take him away in the hope of a good life but his boat sank in the Aegean Sea between Turkey and Greece
 par suruk ke bazaaron main hamane paaya ki sharnaarthiyon ke liye yahaan jivan aasaan nahin he, khaskar bacchon ke liye or bhi mushkil he
 Jemlin's family is also among the millions of Syrian refugees who have taken refuge in Turkey
 inamen se bahut se parivaar behad garib hai
 After 8 hours of hard work 6 days a week, Gemjin earns about 20 Turkish lira, which is less than $ 10 a week
