 team anna ke purv sahyogi agniveshnwarvind kejarivalpar aarope lagaaya he ki unki (kejariwal kii) ichha thi ki jantar-mantar par aamaran anshan ke dauraan anna kii maut ho jaae
 According to Agnivesh Te, Arvind Kejriwal of Aam Aadmi Party felt that Anna's sacrifice would be good for the movement
 swami agnivesh ne yah daawa ek tivi news channel ko die intervyuu main kiya
 According to Agnivesh, when the Jan Lokpal movement started at Jantar Mantar in April 2011, he was against putting Anna on fast unto death
 agnivesh ke mutabit, 'jab mujhe pataa chalaa ki anna aamaran anshan karne vaale hai, to maine arvind se sawaal kiya tha ki vah anna jaise bujurg ko aamaran anshan par kyon baitha rahe hai? is par arvind ne kaha ki unka balidaan ho jaataa he to isse kranti aegi
 It doesn't matter if he dies, it will be good for the movement
 'agnivesh ke mutabik jantar-mantar par anshan ke dauraan sarkaar dwaara sari maangen manjuur karne ke baad bhi arvind kejariwal anna ko paanch-saat din or anshan karne ke liye uksaate rahe
 Agnivesh said, 'from the very beginning of the movement, Kejriwal was running with a big ambition
 unhen lag rahaa tha ki anna ke kandhe par rakhkar hi vah apni bandook chalaa sakate hai
 Kejriwal felt that by taking advantage of Anna's image, he can create a good image among the people
 isi ke chalate unhone anna ko pune se laakar jantar-mantar par bithaaya
 According to Agnivesh, Arvind Kejriwal wanted Anna to continue his agitation
 andolan ke dauraan sarkaar dwaara sari maangen maan lene ke baavjood anna arvind ke uksaave par anshan par date rahe
 When he talked to Arvind, he said that Anna will not break his fast, he will continue his fast for five-seven days
 is baat kaa tab unhen bahut bura laga tha
 He felt that this fast was being done for some other purpose
 agnivesh ke mutabik kiran bedi ko bhi yah baat buree lagi thi
 Swami Agnivesh said that he then spoke to Team Anna members Shanti Bhushan and Prashant Bhushan
 vah bhi is baat par raji the ki ab anna ko anshan tod dena chahie
 When he explained this to Anna, he did not agree
 is par shanti bhushan anna par baras pade
 Anna agreed to break the fast after the press conference threatened to open the pole
 dakshin africa se siries 3-0 se jeetne ke baad team india kii jamkar tarif hui
 On the turning track in Nagpur, the visiting team's batsmen looked helpless in front of the spinners

 Shastri said that his batsmen also have to learn to bat on the turning track
 shastri ne kaha, 'hamaare khilaadi gharelu cricket nahin khelte lekin ye unki galati nahin he
 The entire calendar is replete with cricket

 ' puri siries ke dauraan team india ke diarector ne viraat kohli kii captaini par kai baar khulkar baat kii, lekin ballebaajon kii kamiyon par munh par taale laga liye
 Now Shastri accepted the shortcomings and said, 'the players of the team played cricket abroad in the last two years, but when they returned to the country, the same pitch started to look foreign to them, while they grew up playing on the same pitch
 ' haalanki shastri ne ye bhi kaha ki isse viraat and company ko kaaphi kuch seekhney ko mila he
 The comments kotla test kii do pariyon main do shatak lagane vaale ajinkya rahane kii shastri ne khub tarif kii
 He said, "rahane was out defending once in the first Test and playing an attacking shot once, but in the Kotla innings, Rahane was clear on which shot to stop or what to attack
 ' Shastri has taken a while acknowledging the weakness of Team India's batsmen, but here it can be said that it was better to come late

 About a week after the series was over, Shastri, speaking to the BCCI website, admitted his team's weaknesses
 shastri ne kaha ki unke ballebaajon ko bhi terning trek par ballebaaji seekhni hogi
 Shastri said, 'our players do not play domestic cricket but it is not their fault
 puraa calendar cricket se bharaa padaa he
 The players do not have footwork, which makes them unable to play spin bowlers on the turning track and needs to be improved a lot
 ' During the entire series, the Director of Team India spoke openly on the captaincy of Virat Kohli many times, but kept the mouths closed on the shortcomings of the batsmen
 ab shastri ne kamiyon ko sweekaar karte hue kaha, 'team ke khilaadiyon ne pichley do saalon main videshon main cricket khelaa, lekin jab wo desh waapas laute to yahi pich unhen videshi lagane lagi, jabaki isi pich par wo khelkar bade hue hai
 However, Shastri also said that Virat and company had a lot to learn from this
 tippaniyan Shastri praised Ajinkya Rahane for scoring two centuries in two innings of the Kotla Test
 unhone kaha, 'rahane pehle test main ek baar bachaav karte hue or ek baar atekking shot khelte hue out hue, lekin kotla kii pari main rahane ke man main saaf tha ki kis shot ko rokna he yaa phir kis par atake karnaa he
 ' shastri ko team india ke ballebaajon kii kamajori ko sweekaar karte hue der jarur lagi he, lekin yahaan yaheen kaha ja saktaa he ki der aae durust aae
 By the way, the batsmen of Team India will have to get into the habit of playing on the turning track soon because for the coming one year, Team India is going to play most of the Test series on its own land
 puri siries ke dauraan team india ke diarector ne viraat kohli kii captaini par kai baar khulkar baat kii, lekin ballebaajon kii kamiyon par munh par taale laga liye

 Jaitley said that the government has decided to amend the Income Tax Act to clarify the matter with regard to the imposition of MAT on fiis and meanwhile, the officers working in the field of CBDT will be asked not to pursue the case against fiis
 
 yah ghoshnaa aise samay kii gai he jab vaishvik vittiya uthaa-patake kii vajah se share bazaaron main kaaphi utaar-chadhaav aa rahaa he

 ye teenon ab bhi apane padon par bane hue hai kyonki unke uttaradhikariyon kii abhi tak ghoshnaa nahin hui he
 Distressed over not getting an appointment with Rahul Gandhi, the village headman of Anna Hazare and his colleagues decided to return home and said that even if they had got an appointment now, the village would decide to meet the Congress leader Yes or No

 ham ghar ja rahe hai
 'he said,' We wrote in our letter to meet Rahul Gandhi based on the suggestion of the MP
 thomas ke karyaalay se hamaara kai baar sampark hua
 Even Rahul Gandhi's office called Sarpanch several times
 ’ As lifestyles have changed over time, technology has become our need
 ek samay tha jabacamerakisi uplakshya yaa aayojan ke dauraan hi kaam aata tha, lekin aisa lagata he jaise ab is takanic ne hamaare dainik jivan main apni ek khaas jagah bana lee he
 As such, today it is common to have a digital camera in every smartphone or a great feature phone
 lekin samay ke saath photography yaa yah kahen ki jindagi ke palon ko tasveeron main sanjone kii hasarat badi he
 Digital camera sales have also increased a lot these days in non-phone gadgets stores
 lekin aise main sabase jaruri yah jaan lenaa he ki koun sa camera liya jaae or camera kharidte vakt kin baton kaa khyal rakhaa jaae
 1) Ask yourself these eight questions - Why do you need a camera? - What kind of photography do you want to do with the camera? (portraits, landscape or sports) - Under what circumstances would you do photography? (indoor, outdoor, low light, bright light) - Do you do photography in auto mode or would like to learn the art of photography? - How much do you know about the camera, do you like to do manual photography? Looking for different features? (zoom, image stabilization, fancy or large screen) - How important is the size and weight of the camera to you? - What is your budget? These questions determine to a great extent what your camera should be
 aam taur par showrooms main celsman bhi aapse yahi sawaal karata he
 It is quite possible that he can use your answers to his advantage and give you the product that you do not really need
 2) megapixl ke moh ko tyaag denaam taur par camere ko bechate vakt jis ek cheez kii sabase adhik charchaa hoti he, vah he megapixl
 These days most digital cameras come with at least 5 megapixels
 camera kitne megapixl kaa ho yah aapaki jarurat par nirbhar karata he
 Before making any decision towards this, decide whether you will print the pictures taken? If yes, what will be its size
 kyonki saamaanya sies main printing ke liye 4 yaa usase adhik megapixl kaa camera paryaapt he
 Think of it in such a way that the megapixel directly determines how big your picture can be without being pixelated
 jabaki jarurat se adhik megapixl se ek ghaataa yah he ki megapixl badhane ke saath hi har tasviir aapke memory card main zyada spes legi
 3) Accessories: What you will get along with buying the camera, along with its features, also check what is going to be found in the extras
 jo chijen aapke liye jaruri hai, unamem- camera cese, memory card, atirikt betry, charger, lens (agar DSLR camera he to), filter, trypod, monopod, ekstranal flash, riflector aadi
 Actually, these are the things that you need in the end
 isliye behatar deal tay karen
 4) Search for other offers If accessories are less with the camera, then look for other deals
 online or ritel bazaar main bhi is tarah ke kai ophers milte hai
 5) DSLR or Compact Point and Shoot These days DSLR camera has become more of a status symbol
 lekin jaruri nahin ki yah aapke kaam kaa ho
 Think of it in such a way that if you want to do normal photography in auto mode then it is not much useful for you
 saath hi yah zyada vajani or mahangaa he
 Its cleaning and maintenance process is also complex
 lekin agar aap photography kii kala ko siikhnaa chaahate hai
 Manual photography rather than auto mode attracts you then DSLR camera is right for you
 7) optical juum ko chunecamaron main do tarah ke juum aate hai
 One digital and the other optical
 behatar hogaoptical juumavaale camere kaa chunaav karen
 Digital zoom camera only increases the pixels of your shot
 isse aapako subject bada dikhne lagata he
 But this makes the picture pixelated
 dhyaan rakhen ki aapkaa camera kam se kam 3x optical juum vaala ho
 This means that it will make your subject three times larger
 7) rivyuu padhencamera kharidne se pehle thodaa homework kar len
 Choose the model of camera according to your needs and budget
 phir online yaa magazine main chhapane vaale rivyuu ko padhein
 If buying online, read the customer review as well
 8) first hand experionssho room se camera kharid rahe hai to camera haath main lekar achche se jaanch len
 That means whether the camera fits in your hands or not
 aap uske saath confort feel kar rahe hai yaa nahin
 Take a picture or two
 saare opshan or fitures ko jaanch len
 9) Negotiation As a customer, bargaining is your birthright
 apane is adhikaar kaa prayog jarur karen
 Compare prices online and buy only
 ritel bazaar se kharid rahe hai to kai saare store par discount ofer kii jaankaree icttha karne ke baad hi product khariden
 In the next article, discuss which is better for you with the DSLR and compact cameras (point and shoot)

 "isse spasht he ki ghar se baahar ho yaa ghar ke andar, donon hi sthiti main skin kii dekhbhaal aavashyak he
 Rashmi further suggested, "to limit this side effect to a certain extent, be sure to use the Blue Lights Shield on your digital devices and apply sunscreen to the face even when indoors
 "organic harvest ke anusandhan or vikaas visheshgy dharma rajput ne kaha ki cyolin clay or alovera yukt sanscreen kaa upyog apni twachaa kii dekhbhaal ke liye karen jo twachaa se gandagi ko dur kar aapako 24 / 7 suraksha pradaan karti he
 He also said, "use a full table spoon organic sunscreen to protect the skin from UVA and UVB rays and reapply it every two or three hours while cleaning the face, even while at home

 com / wrbgjcakrn— ANI (@ani_news)july 25, 2015 India have registered a sixth win in the tournament by defeating the West Indies by 125 runs in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 match
 bharat 11 ankon ke saath 10 tiimon kii ankatalika main duusare sthaan par aa gaya he
 New Zealand too have 11 points but India are ahead due to better run rate
 world cap 2019 main ab tak bharat ne south africa, australia, pakistan, afghanistan or westeindies ko dhul chataayee he
 India's journey in the tournament has been fantastic so far, but a weakness of experienced batsman MS Dhoni can be a problem for the team in the upcoming big matches
 emes dhoni kii batting par sawalamhendra singh dhoni kii sabase badi kamajori jo ab tak saamne ai he, vah he strike ko kam rotate karnaa or dot ball adhik khelnaa
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni smashed 56 off 61 balls in the World Cup match against the West Indies
 dhoni ne apni pari ke dauraan sirf 3 chauke or 2 chakke lagaae
 The most interesting thing during Dhoni's innings was that during his 56-run innings, Dhoni scored the first 26 runs off 45 balls
 is dauraan unka strike rate 57
 Was 78
 dhoni ne agle 30 ran 16 gendon par banaae
 Then his strike rate of 187
 50 kaa tha
 Dhoni could not stump the half-pitch, India wicket slows due to this weakness of Indies wicketkeeper Dhoni
 pichley do maichon main bharat kii pari khaskar 30 overon ke baad kaaphi dhimi hui he
 Due to which India is not able to reach the score of 300
 afghanistan or westeindies ke khilaaf dhoni kii batting bahut saadhaaran rahi he
 The loss will be due to slow batting, because of this weakness of Dhoni in the matches like semifinals and finals, if India can not score big then the team may have to suffer big losses
 isse pehle afghanistan ke khilaaf world cap match main mahendra singh dhoni ne 52 gendon par 28 ranon kii pari khelkar phens ko niraash kar diya tha
 Then Sachin expressed his displeasure at Dhoni's batting
 purv bhartiya ballebaaj vivies lakshmana ne dhoni ko lekar bada bayaan diya
 VVS Laxman said that Dhoni will have to work on this approach
 lakshmana ne kaha, 'pari kii shuruyaat main dhoni kaa strike rate 45-50 ke bich tha
 This creates pressure on the team and the player batting with them
 yah thik he ki aap finnish acchhee style main karte ho lekin shuruyaat main vah (dhoni) vishesh rup se fabian alan jaise spinner ke khilaaf sakaaratmak iraade se khel sakate the
 Laxman further said, "I think the way MS Dhoni starts his innings one day he will regret it
" yah vah aria he jis par dhoni ko kaam karne kii jarurat he
 Even in the last match against Afghanistan, it was difficult for Dhoni to rotate the strike
 yah sab acha he jab tej gendbaaj gendbaaji kar rahe hote hai
 He did not show positive intent initially unlike Hardik Pandya

 Two hours after the launch, Nassane wrote in a blog, 'the spacecraft is in better condition and it is working on its own
 parker solar prob suraj ko sparsh karne ke abhiyaan par chal padaa he
 Thomas Jurbukan, Associate Administrator of NASA Science Expeditionary Directorate said- 'this expedition marks the first human journey towards a star, which will not only affect the Earth here but we can understand our universe better by it

 How hot any thing will be depends on the temperature and how many things are present in the atmosphere

 Raghuram Rajan, a leading economist and former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, believes that India, with its immense potential, can do a lot more but it has to avoid complacency

 Sangha is a prosperous farmer of Punjab and grows potatoes and maize on hundreds of acres of farms spread across the state

 Potatoes and corn! Who would be able to think that with these two minor agricultural commodities, one will be able to raise a mountain of prosperity? Sangha has done this

 But the question arises that in the era when the farmers of Punjab were turning towards more beneficial wheat and paddy, how did the Sangha family move towards attaining the high from potato? Experts believe that the secret of their success lies in the use of high technology

 Secondly, we help them to grow these crops with the help of their experience and knowledge

 Pakistan still denies it, but links to important documents from the enemy have been drawn up and the events that took place from Pakistan during this campaign
 jo dastavej baraamad hue, ve samiti ke sadasyon ko yah maanane ke liye paryaapt aadhaar dete the ki pakistan ke is abhiyaan ke shuruyaat se hi use vifal hona tha

 And then there is mention of strong evidence
 op capi ke shadyantrkaari general musharraf 28 march ko sector kaa daura karte hai
 He calls this strategy "a response to the 1984 Siachen invasion of India" and pays 8,000 rupees to distribute sweets among the 12 nli's Mujahids

 In a special conversation with India Today in July 2004, Nawaz Sharif said, "the number of soldiers killed in Kargil was more than the total number of soldiers killed in the 1965 and 1971 wars
 '' iskaa koi aadhikarik bayaan nahin he, kuch log 2,700 kehete hai to kuch isse bhi zyada
 During his exile in Saudi Arabia, Sharif promised to investigate it when he returned to power
 lekin unhone aisa kiya nahin
 After Musharraf left for London in November 2010, the army uploaded a list of 453 soldiers killed in Opp KP
 is varsh 26 july ko bharat kargil jang kii 20veen varshganth ko vijay diwas ke rup main manayega, jisamen 474 jawan shahid hue
 From the Battle of Jammu and Kashmir in 1947 and the subsequent three wars up to Kargil, 26 / 11 in Mumbai, Uri and Pulwama, there has been a long series of unannounced and declared wars with Pakistan
 isaki maanak sanchaalan prakriya yaa standard oparating proscisger (esaopi) vaisaa hi he he jaisaa nicksan-yug main rajnatik salaahkaar rajanetaaon ko apane paraamarsh main kehete the, ''kuch bhi sweekaaren nahin
 Refute everything palatakar khud hi aarope lagane shuru kar den
 "the same SOP is also seen in the encirclement of the Pakistani army for nearly two months in the area after the attack of Indian Air Force fighter jets on the terrorist training camp of jaish-e-mohammed on 26 February this year
" balakot kii juba pahari par bane shivi ko 10 april ko pakistani sena kii sakht nigaraanee ke bich daure ke liye kholaa gaya

 'denial of everything' also shows why after Pakistan's propaganda about 'second pilot of Indian Air Force', it was suddenly silenced, which even Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan claimed On February 27, two Indian pilots were caught
 (bharat kaa maananaa he ki jis duusare payalat kii baat pakistan kar rahaa vah pakistani vaayu sena ke epa-16 vimaan kaa hi tha jise maar giraaya gaya)
 It took Pakistan 11 years to accept its soldiers killed in the Kargil war

 Instead of taking a lesson from that lion of the Pakistani army Saadi will be grown without learning anything

 pakistan kii taraf se of spinner said ajmal ne apane kariyar kaa sarvshereshth pradarshan karte hue 24 ran dekar paanch wicket liye
 If India fails to defend the score, it will be the first occasion after 29 years when India lost all the matches of the ODI series on their soil

 Gambhir (15) gave his wicket in reward by taking a catch on point in an attempt to cut on the rising ball of Irfan, while Kohli (7) wanted to play Junaid's ball defensively without using the body but he took the outer edge of his bat
 Younis went into the safe hands of Khan at slip
 dilli ke in donon ballebaajon ke liye yah shrinkhalaa bahut kharaab rahi
 If Gambhir managed to score 34 runs in three matches, last year, only 13 runs were recorded in the name of Kohli, who scored the most runs in every format for India

 bhartiya darshakon kii khushi haalanki kisi bhi samay bahut adhik der tak nahin tiki
 Raina sent Hafeez for six runs off long on and then Dhoni hit the same bowler for two consecutive sixes but off-spinner Ajmal trapped India again in the whirlpool by lbw Raina and new batsman r Ashwin on consecutive balls

 Completed 100 runs in 4 overs
 dhoni ne lagaataar do wicket girane ke baavjood hafeez ke agle over main phir se midwicket par chakka lagaaya
 When the Indian captain was on 29, he got his life but he could not take advantage of it
 gul kii gend par hawa main cat karne ke prayaas main unhone point par kaich thama diya
 Dhoni, who hit a four and three sixes in his 55-ball innings, was out for the first time in an ODI on Indian soil after the World Cup semi-final against Pakistan in Mohali

 The Ganges will be cleared automatically
 teesri baat isko baandhne kii jo koshish ho rahi he wo galat he ganga ko baahar kar koi vikaas nahin ho saktaa
 The people associated with this platform are unmoved by the government, and therefore want to create a big movement by making people aware of the Ganges
 inke is bhagirath prayaas ko dekhakar aap kah sakate hai ki koshishen kaamyaab hoti hai
 These people, who have gathered in Banaras, have also been trying to save the Ganges for the last two decades

 But these people are trying to save the Ganges without any selfishness
 inaki ye eemaandaar koshish ek din rang jarur laaegi

 ‘‘ham apni sabhi dijal kaaren agle saal april se bechnaa band kar denge
 Diesel cars will become quite expensive once the new emission standards are implemented
 khaskar, choti kaaren jo 1
 They come with engines smaller than 5 liters, their prices will not be suitable for customers
 si
 Bhargava, Chairman, Maruti Suzuki India Limited's recent statement from the country's largest car maker Maruti can be seen as a farewell message for small diesel cars in India
 bharat ke car bazaar main maaruti kii hissedari 50 fisadi he
 After Maruti, Tata Motors has also hinted at discontinuing its select diesel models
 tata motors ke president (paisanger whical bijness unit) mayank paarikh kehete hai, ‘‘choti or entry level kaaron main dijal ingine kii ghatati demand ke chalate nayaa chota ingine bananaa tarksangat nahin hoga
 He also made it clear that whatever the cost will be to meet BS VI standards, the burden will ultimately fall on the customers
 company kii kul bikri main 80 fisadi hissedari petrol kaaron kii he
 Indeed, to curb vehicular pollution, the government has mandated Bharat Stage VI (BS VI) emission standards from April 1, 2020
 yani 1 april, 2020 kii bani kisi car yaa motorcycle main laga ingine bies VI maanakon ke anuroop hoga, jo dijal kaaron se hone vaale pradooshan ko 80 fisadi tak kam karegaa
 The BS VI standard is parallel to the international standard Euro VI
 philhal automobile industry bies IV maanakon kaa paalan kar rahi he, jo euro IV ke baraabar he
 In such a situation it would cost to upgrade the technology to make the existing engine compliant with BS VI standard
 sust maang se jujh rahe automobile sector ke liye yah ab nai chunauti he
 All cars will be expensive, says Yogendra Pratap, editor of Auto Today, "with BS VI engine all kinds of petrol and diesel cars will become expensive
 ’’ petrol or dijal kaaron kii keemat ke bich kaa antar badhkar kareeb 2 lakh ru
 Is likely to be 1 to 1 at the moment
 25 lakh ru
 Is between yogendra bataate hai, ‘‘petrol ingine ko nae maanakon ke anuroop banane main kam kharch aayega
 Nevertheless, the average price of these cars is Rs 50,000
 tak kii badhotaree ho sakati he
 At the same time, it will cost more to build diesel engines according to BS VI standard because they are more complex
 ’’ haalanki, car kii keemat alag-alag model par nirbhar karegi
 Apart from this, the auto sector is under pressure to follow the safety norms
 jisamen air bag, abs, krash test retings aadi maanakon ko puraa karnaa anivaary ho jayega
 In such a situation, all types of cars are bound to be expensive
 khatm ho jaaengi choti dijal karenoto export tutu dhawan kehete hai, ‘‘bies nkadhrh maanak aane ke baad choti dijal kaaren khatm ho jaaengi
 Their prices will not be favorable to the customers
 ’’ isi vajah se companiyon ne chote dijal ingine par nivesh karne main khaas ruchi nahin dikhaai he
 Dhawan says, "1
 5 litre yaa usase bade ingine vaali esayuvi yaa utility wheekals segment main dijal kaaron kii maang abhi bani rahegi’’ fortuner kaa udhaaharan dete hue ve kehete hai ki 17 lakh main launch hui gaadi aaj 34 lakh ru
 Even if the customers are present, then the price is a few lakhs
 badaae se maang ekadam hi khatm nahin ho jaaegi
 Diesel cars still account for 83 per cent of the SUV segment, up from 98 per cent in 2012
 haalanki, graahakon ke bich dijal kaaren pehle hi lokapriyata kho rahi hai
 According to the data, the share of diesel in car sales in the year 2012-13 was 47 percent which decreased to 19 percent in 2018-19
 isaki badi vajah petrol or dijal ke daamon ke bich kaa antar kam hona or vibhinn paabandiyaan hai
 Petrol price in Capital Delhi (08 May) 73 Rs
 prati litre he, jabaki dijal 66
 66 Rs
 prati litre bik rahaa he
 At the same time, diesel in april-may 2012 as compared to petrol was Rs 25 per liter
 sasta tha
 Customers 1 to 1 for diesel cars
 25 lakh ru
 They were willing to pay more because they were cheaper to run due to cheap fuel and good mileage
 par ab chijen badal gai hai
 In December 2015, the Supreme Court had banned the registration of more than 2000 cc diesel engines in Delhi
 iske alaava rashtriya harith adhikaran (engiti) ne 10 saal ke puraani dijal kaaron ko dilli ensiaar kii sadakon se hataane ke aadesh die the
 These orders may have been banned later, but the developments in previous years have created an uncertainty in the minds of customers about diesel cars
 yogendra kehete hai, ‘‘pradooshan par ankush lagane ke liye sarkaar ko nijee or vyavsaayik vaahanon ke liye samaan niyam banane honge
 Rules should be made on the basis of pollution and not on the basis of the CC of the engine, because if properly maintained, even after 10 years, a diesel car will not cause much pollution
 ’’dijal kaaron ke khilaaf maahaul na sirf bharat balki european union jaise bade paisanger whical market main bhi ban rahaa he
 The debate has gained momentum after the revelations of Volkswagen rigging
 toyota ne apni dijal kaaron ko europe main band karne kaa faisla liya he
 Porsche and Volvo have clarified that their upcoming models will not be diesel-based
 germany jaise desh jo dijal car banane main agrani he, vahaan bhi dijal kaaron par pratibandh kii baat chal rahi he
 What if not diesel? Dhawan says how much role petrol, CNG or electric vehicles will play in meeting the shortage of small diesel cars will depend on the policies of the government
 infrastracchar kaa abhaav isamen ek badi chunauti he
 Giving the example of Rajdhani, he says that it has been more than 20 years since CNG arrived in Delhi, but even today people have to spend hours in line
 aise main or zyada gadibhan agar sienji par shift hoti hai to bade nivesh kii jarurat hogi
 Companies are also working towards electric cars
 sarkaar kii nitiyaan spasht huin to aane vaale varshon main electric car bhi vikalp ban sakati hai
 The Society for Indian Automobile Manufacturers expects the electric vehicle to account for 40 percent of sales by 2030
 nae badlaavon ke baad maang par asar sambhavit he
 In such a situation, the challenge before the government will also be to support the pace of the already slowing auto sector

 cameti ko 2 maheene me ek baar meeting karnaa anivaary hoga
 Apart from giving suggestions on pollution, the committee will also have the responsibility to implement the suggestions

 The people of Delhi are very tolerant who are facing this attitude of work, as well as the people of neighboring states are also forced to bear this pollution
 sadak par pani chhidakane par NGT ke sawalenjiti ne sadako par pani chhidkane ke faisle par bhi sawaal uthaaya ki jab hawa me pradooshan he to road ko saafe karke pradooshan ko kaise kam kiya ja saktaa he
 Also, how can the treated sewage water be sprayed on the road where people are walking on the road
 paryaavaran mantralay ne bataaya ki puraane vaahanon ke chaalaan se lekar unako zabt karne tak kaa kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 The NGT asked whether you had done research on how much pollution levels were coming down due to your efforts
 rajya sarkaron ko bhi sochna hoga ki pradooshan ko rokane ke liye sarkare jo saamaanya kaam kar rahi he uskaa koi prabhaav pad bhi rahaa he yaa nahin
 Regarding crop burning, Punjab asked the NGT from Punjab and Haryana about crop burning, that you checked that the farmers there are ready to use Happy Seeder machine
 punjab ne kaha ki sabhi kisaanon ko ek saath mashin uplabdh karnaa abhi sambhav nahin he
 But the government is trying to increase the use of machines and crop burning should not be done by farmers
 engiti ne kaha ki kya aap ye mashin kisaanon ko muft dene ko taiyaar he
 There should not be any burden of paying any amount to the farmer on its use
 lekin punjab or haryana is par engiti ko kuch khaas zawaab nahin de paae
 He says that this machine can be given to farmers by giving subsidy
 lekin engiti ne kaha ki ye free of cast hona chahie
 Suggestions sought from UP on WHO report: NGT told Uttar Pradesh that WHO has issued a list in which many districts of your state are the most polluted areas in the world
 aapkaa kya suzav he ki kaise isko sudhara ja saktaa he
 UP said that we are following your suggestions and taking action against those who are responsible for pollution
