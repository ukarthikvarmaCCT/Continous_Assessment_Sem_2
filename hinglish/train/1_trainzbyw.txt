 dilli ke dayaal singh college (morning) ke chaatro ne somvaar ko campus main jamkar virodh pradarshan kiya
 Initially, people felt that this demonstration of students is about the new name of Evening College 'vande Mataram' College, but the students who were demonstrating clearly said that we have no objection to the new name of Evening College
 morning college kii chaatra deepa ne kaha ki aap college kaa namvande maataramarkhie yaa bharat mata mahavidhyalay hamen isse koi aapatti nahin he
 We are concerned that Evening College is being shifted in the morning on the same campus, this is causing problems for students everywhere from class to canteen
 darasal, dayaal singh college morning main kareeb 6 hazaar chaatr padhate hai, jabaki evening college main chaatro kii sankhya kareeb 3 hazaar he
 Such students argue that if about 9 thousand children study in the same campus, then resources and facilities should be increased as compared to that
 morning college ke chaatr sumit ke mutabik college main pehle se hi suvidhaayen or college ke mukaable kam hai, college main chaatronke liye alag se ECA room nahin hai
 Common rooms are also very small
 nai building play ground main hi ban rahi he
 In this case, the playing space has also reduced
 isliye ham chaahate hai ki college prashasan pehle suvidhaayen badaye phir evening college ko jis bhi naam se shift karke morning main shuru karen
 Nobody would mind
 evening college ke chaatro ne bhi kaha ki ek hi samay main donon college ek hi campus main shuru hone par thodi pareshaani to hogi, lekin hamen bataaya gaya he ki jald hi nai building main kakshaen shuru hongi
 As far as the issue is concerned about 'vande Mataram', no student or teacher of the college has any objection to the name
 aapako bataa den ki dayaal singh college (evening) kii gavarning body ne sarvasammati se college kaa naam 'vande maataram' prastaavit kiya he
 This proposal of the governing body has been sent to the University of Delhi for approval
 vishvavidhyalay ke sutron ke mutabik college ke nae naam par jald hi adhikarik muhar lag sakati he

 routine ke hisaab se offis janaa jaruri he
 But sometimes it happens that you get up at the sound of alarm but do not feel like going to office
 tab jarurat hoti he ek rifreshment kii jo aapako chuttee se milti he
 Let's know about the excuses which are usually made to seek leave from office
 1
 Most of the employees working in the health poor office are ahead in taking leave on the pretext of health
 jab unhen kaam hota he or chuttee chahie hoti he, usee vakt dast, sar dard yaa phir food poijaning kii samasya ho jaati he
 2
 bachche kii beemariaise karmchaaree jo shaadi-shuda hote hai, ve aksar chuttee ke liye bachche kii tabiyat thik na hone kaa bahaanaa banaate he
 The child's case is a bit emotional, so the boss also easily approves the holiday
 3
 Appointment from a doctor Appointment from a doctor is one of the excuses usually made
 bos bhi samajhate hai kiapointment mushkilse milti he to chuttee de di jaae
 4
 accident honagadee se offis aane vaale log agar chahen to ye bhi kah dete hai ki aaj raste main meri gaadi kaa accident ho gaya
 Because of which i got hurt
 main offis nahin aa saktaa
 At the same time, calling or messaging the boss many times, saying that today my foot slipped in the bathroom which caused a sprain, is one of the most spoken lies
 5
 The death of a relative is very much such that when it seems that i was recently discharged, it is difficult to meet again
 tab ve bahaanaa bana dete hai ki merekisi dur rishtedaarka nidhan ho gaya he
 6
 dekhne vaale aa rahe hanisamen sharmaane vaali koi baat nahin he sabhi kii shaadi hoti he
 That is why if you want leave from office, use this excuse fearlessly
 or agar aapaki shaadi ho chuki he
 So you can make an excuse for the arrival of relatives of sister or brother
 7
 Government Career No one knows how difficult it is to get government work done
 ek kaam ke liye 50 baar chakkar lagane hote he
 In such a situation, when you ask for leave citing the work of court, court and bank etc
, you can get a holiday
 note:jindagi main aage badhane ke liye kaaphi mehnat kerani hoti he
 For this, you have to give up your happiness
 haa, kaam karte-karte koi bhi thak jaataa he
 Everyone needs a break
 is tarah kaa brake lene ke liye acha yahi hoga ki aap apane bos ke saath eemaandaar rahen or puri sachai bataaen
 We do not accept these excuses as correct to avoid work

 duniyabar me is vakt ek hi charchaa he, or ye he ishk kii ek gupachup kahani kii, charchaa he sarhad paar surkhiyon main aayi ek lav story kii
 And that is the love story of Bilawal Ali Bhutto, the only son of Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari and Pakistan Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar
 ji haa khabaren behad garm hai, itani garm kii soshal media main sirf or sirf isi kaa zikr ho rahaa he
 It is being said that Bilawal Ali Bhutto has been arrested in the chains of Hina's love
 duniya tak pahunchi hina-bilaval kii muhabbat kii aanchado dil mil rahe hai chupake chupake, magar do dilon kii dhadakanon kii awaz ab jamaane ko sunai pad rahi he
 When and how the Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Ali Bhutto and Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar, who were ruling in Pakistan, opened the doors of love in each other's heart, no one was aware of it
 or jab pataa chalaa, to pakistan ke siyaasi hi nahin, saamaajik galiyaaron main bhi jaise bhuuchaal gaya
 This fire of love is in Pakistan, but its heat has reached the world, then through Bangladesh
 bangladesh ke vikali tabloid blitz ke hawaale se ye report ai he ki bilaval or hina kii muhabbat us mukaam tak pahunch chuki he, jahaan se peeche hatana donon ke dilon ko gavaara nahin he
 Willing to sacrifice everything, Bilawal and Hinaulfat sacrificed till the end of the problem
 ye to aapane bhi suna hoga ki kaise pyaar balidaan maangata he or prem karne vaale hanskar is par apana sab kuch nisaar kar dete hai
 Bilawal has also descended into Hina's love to such a depth that he is ready to sacrifice even his political strength
 23 saal ke bilaval apane se 12 saal badi hina kii jhil jaisi neeli ankhon main is kadar dub chuke hai ki party kii kaman tak chhodane ke liye taiyaar hai
 The fire is on both sides, so it is also reported that Hina can also decline the chair of the Foreign Minister to take her love to the beautiful turning point of marriage
 charchaa to yahaan tak he ki bilaval kii dilruba banane ke liye wo apane arbapati, shuhar firoz gulzaar ko talaak dene ke liye bhi taiyaar hai
 No one knows what will be the result of this love falling in the corridors of politics
 lekin hina ko yakeen he ki bilaval kii muhabbat kii hina unki hatheliyon par jarur sajegi
 And Bilawal also feels that the last floor of his crime is heena
 bangladeshi tabloid ne kiya khulhasapakistan main koi bhi bilaval or hina kii muhabbat par muhar nahin laga rahaa he lekin khabaren khub aa rahi he
 a Bangladeshi Weekly tabloid has revealed this love that grew in two hearts
 is tabloid kii maane to hina or bilaval apni muhabbat ke aage asif ali zaradaari kii bhi nahin sun rahe hai
 The revelation of Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Hina Rabbani Khar's love is as sensational as the sensational one, because now the President of Pakistan and Asif Ali Zardari of Bilawal Bhutto are standing in the way of this love
 baghawat ko bhi taiyaar hai bilavalpakistan pipuls party ke chairman bilaval or pakistan pipuls party kii sarkaar main mantri hina kaa mail-jol chaar saal purana he
 But during this time no one knows when the two came close to each other and drowned in the depths of love, and when it is learned, it is being said that Bilawal proceeded to the extent of rebellion to offer his love
 Have been bilaval or hina ke ishk kaa khulaasa karne vaale akhbaar ke mutabik jaradaari ko apane sahabjade kii muhabbat kii bhanak 21 sitambar 2011 ko lagi
 It was Bilawal's birthday that day and Hina Rabbani Khar sent a card with a bouquet to Bilawal, which said - The foundation of our relationship lies in the depths of our heart and soon we will be one
 sakate main asif ali zaradaarikhabaron ke mutabik, apane bete or apni sarkaar main videsh mantri ke bich muhabbat kii khabar se zaradaari sakate main the
 It is reported that when they found Bilawal and Hina's mobile phone records, it was revealed that Ishq's fire was on both sides
 zaradaari ne donon ko ishaaron main samajhane kii koshish kii
 Zardari explained that Bilaval, 12 years younger than Hina, married and the mother of two children, has no future, but neither Hina understood this, nor did Bilawal listen to one of his father
 khabaron ke mutabik, pakistan ke raashtrapati bhawan main pita or putr ke bich shityudh shuru ho chukaa tha
 But this year, on Eid, the matter has gone beyond limits
 bangladesh ke akhbaar kaa daawa he ki hina ne id ke tohfe main bilaval ko guladaste ke saath apane haath se likhaa sandesh bheja, jisamen likhaa tha, 'hamane bahut intazaar kiya, ab vakt he ki ham apane intazaar ko khatm kar den
 Happy Eid
 'hina ne di pipipi chhodane kii dhamkeekaha jaataa he ki zaradaari ko jab hina ke is sandesh kii khabar mili, to unhone fouran hina rabbaani khar ko talab kiya or jamkar khari-khoti sunai
 Zardari stated clearly that he did not approve of Hina's extra marital affair with her unborn son
 lekin hina tab tak baghaavat ke mood main aa chuki thim
 According to the newspaper, Hina bluntly told Zardari that she would not tolerate anyone interfering in her personal matter
 hina ne mantri pad ke saath-saath pakistan pipuls party chhodane tak kii chetavanee de di
 When Bilawal got the news about his love affair between Hina and Zardari, his mercury also reached the seventh sky
 hina ke pyaar main duube bilaval ne apane pita se baghaavat kaa khulaa elaan kar diya
 Hina is seeking a divorce from her husband, it is said that Hina is also on her way to become a partner of Bilawal
 wo iske liye apni donon betiyon ko bhi chhodane ko taiyaar hai, or ab apane shuhar firoz gulzaar se talaak maang rahi hai
 She agrees to transfer her share in her husband's business to her daughters, provided Feroze Gulzar easily divorces her
 khabar ye bhi he ki agar hina ko talaak mila, to wo bhi mantri kii kursi or pakistan kii raajnneeti ko by-by kahkar bilaval ke saath pardes ja sakati hai

 bjp's national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya has given a controversial statement on the defeat of BJP candidate Surendra Nath Singh from Bhopal Madhya in Madhya Pradesh assembly elections
 apane bayanon ko lekar aksar surkhiyon main rahane vaale vijayawargeey ne kaha ki surendranath singh kii haar se zyada unhen is baat kaa sabase zyada dukh he ki rashtravaadi takaton ke aage bif khaane vaale jeet gaye
 At the BJP booth worker conference in Bhopal, Vijayvargiya said that many leaders have lost elections, but i am most saddened by the defeat of Surendranath Singh
 darasal vijayawargeey ke nishane par congress ke jite hue muslim vidhayak aarif masood the
 Let me tell you that there was a direct contest between Surendra Nath Singh of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Arif Masood of Congress on Bhopal Madhya Assembly seat
 is seat par baaji palatate hue congress ke aarif masood ne jeet darj kii
 He received 76647 votes, while Surendranath Singh received 61,890 votes
 isse pehle 2013 ke chunaav main surendra nath singh ne jeet hasil kii thi
 He defeated Arif Masood
 2018 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main congress ne pradesh main 15 saal kaa sookhaa khatm karte hue jeet darj kii
 The BJP won 109 seats against the Congress's 114 seats in the 230-member assembly
 is jeet ke saath congress ne rajya kii kaman apane diggaj netaa kamalnath ke haathon main de di
 The reaction of Congress MLA Arif Masood from Bhopal Central has also come to light on the statement of Kailash Vijayvargiya
 aarif masood ne kaha ki unke vidhansabha kshetra main kareeb 60 fisadi voter hindu hai, aise main kailash vijayawargeey kaa bayaan un sabakaa apmaan he

 He said that the Congress does not have strong leaders to contest the next Lok Sabha elections
 isliye vah aise chocolati chehron ke madhyam se chunaav ladanaa chaahati he
 If the Congress had confidence in Rahul's leadership, Priyanka would not have been brought into active politics

 This book is a collection of stories written on the basis of the relationship between Kashmiri Pandits and Muslims until the 1989 separatist movement erupted in Kashmir
 pichley do dashak main musalamaanon or panditon ne jo dard jhela he, khushboo-e-kashmir khantee urdu main usee kaa ek vrittant he
 "I have seen the pain of pundits and Muslims who had to prove their identity every day," says Sheerin
 ” shirin baraamula jile ke isi naam ke chote-se gaanv ke rahane vaale hai
 Like many other families, he too came to Jammu
 vahaan kuchhek saal ek akhbaar main kaam karte rahe, baad main polisbal main chale gaye

 In a story called Andhi Maa, Sheeri exposes the face of humanity in the haze of terrorism
 ve seemaant jile kupwada ke handwara ilaake ke ek pandit mohalle main pathakon ko le jate hai jahaan ek andhi, beaulad budhi vidhwaa ne ek aatankwaadi ko sharan di hui he
 He helped the old man to cross the river
 aatankwaadi ne khud ko srinagar kaa ek dukandaar bataaya tha
 On the first day there, the terrorist wipes the dust on the pictures of Ram and Sita
 vah gharelu kaamon main bhi haath bantane lagata he
 One day a police raid finds a pistol from the house
 mahila police se aatankwaadi ko or aatankwaadi mahila ko chhod dene ko kehete hai
 In the end, the police send both of them as mad and send them to a mental asylum
 shiri apni har kahani main shiddat se kashmiriat ko ubhaarte najar aate hai, jo donon samudaayon ke aapasi sadbhaav se bani he
 In such a tumultuous period, the purpose of writing this book was that of Sheeri so much that he could bring out the small relations between Hindus and Muslims
 mahagathbandhan se nitish ne naata todakar bijepi se haath milakar satta par kabiz hai
 In such a situation, it is a big challenge for the Congress to save its mlas, but the senior leaders of the party are not worried about it
 jabaki satta se alag hone ke baad kai congressi vidhayakon ke man main satta sukh kii laalasaa jaag rahi
 This is the reason that the possibility of a break-up of the Congress MLA has increased and there may be a political upheaval in the state soon
 baat den ki bihar main congress bees saal ke baad 2015 main satta main lauti thi
 She may not have occupied the throne of power in the state, but she is definitely a partner in power
 aise main congressi vidhayakon ko do dashak ke baad satta sukh bhogane kaa mauka mila tha
 But after Nitish joined hands with the BJP, the Congress mlas are happily lost in power
 darasal 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main karaari haar ke baad bijepi se muqabla karne ke liye nitish kumaar, lalu yadav or congress ne milakar mahagathbandhan banaaya tha
 Nitish Kumar became the face of this grand alliance
 soobe kii 243 siton main se 101 par argedy, 101 jedyu or 41 seat congress par congress ladi thi
 If sources are to be believed, Nitish Kumar had intervened in the Congress ticket along with distributing his party tickets during the 2015 assembly elections
 unhone apane ek darjan chaheton ko congress party se tikat dilaane kaa kaam kiya tha
 Many of them were also successful in winning the MLA
 maujuuda badale hue sameekaran main nitish kumaar apane ko or majboot karne kii koshish main lage hue hai
 In such a situation, he is in the Congress MLA on his target, in which he played an important role in getting the Congress ticket in 2015
 isiilie mana ja rahaa he ki congress main jabardast tut hone ja rahi he
 Its role has been worked out and the Congress has around 10 mlas, who are in constant touch with the outstanding chief Nitish Kumar
 soobe ke congressi savarna vidhayakon ko congress kaa argedy ke sang itnaa prem bhi raas nahin aa rahaa he
 If sources are to be believed, most of the upper caste mlas of the party want to go to BJP, while the trend of many mlas from the most backward and Mahadalit community seems to be leaning towards JDU
 darasal congressi vidhayakon kii tut kii ek vajah or bhi he
 The MLA of the Congress does not like the RJDK
 chaahe wo vichaardhaara kaa maamla ho yaa kshetra main voton kaa hisaab kitaab
 The Congress had a chance to run the government after 20 years in the state, but the government lost its hand due to the central leadership not having a clear decision on Tejashwi Yadav
 20 maheenon tak satta kaa swaad chakh chuke congressiyon ko ye raas nahin aa rahaa he
 The biggest resentment of Congress leaders is about the silence of the party high command
 congress ke adhikansh sthaneey netaaon kaa maananaa he ki tejasvi yadav ke maamle main agar alaakaman nitish kumaar ke saath rahane kaa nirnay le leti to shayaad yah din dekhnaa na padataa
 Due to these complaints after losing the power of Bihar, Congress leaders are now looking for an alternative
 rajya main congress ke 27 vidhayak hai, aise main jaankaron kii maane to aane vaale dinon main agar party tuutati he, to kisi ko aashcharya nahin hona chahie
 It is worth noting that the relationship between RJD and Congress is very old, which started in 1997 when Sitaram Kesri was the Congress President

 At the same time, when Lalu's government caught in the fodder scam was in crisis, the Congress supported and raised it

 TV has always been a big commitment, but for a web series we shoot it like a film and when it is released once, it stays there forever

 But the desperate Rane said, "the response was not very good

 sonaali ne hameshaa se hi apni cancer yatra ko apane phens ke bich share kiya he
 She recently told an interview to Harper Bazaar about how she had moved on in life after losing her hair
 sonaali ne kaha ki 'jab maine apana sar shev kiya tha to mere frends ne unhen paas rakhane ke liye kaha tha, wo shaayad mere apane baalo ke saath judaav ke chalate aisa kah rahe the lekin main un baalo se chhutkaaraa paanaa chaahati thi kyonki wo mere nahin the
 i wanted to get away from them
 ' unhone ye bhi kaha ki ve apane lambey baalo ke saath kaaphi kuch chipa rahi thi or jab unhen inase aaazaad hone kaa mauka mila to unki persenality kaa ek nayaa kalevar dekhne ko mila
 Sonali shared a video on Instagram in which she was getting ready for the magazine cover shoot
 sonaali ne is video ke capshan main likhaa, 'mujhe chote baalo ke saath aadi hone main thodaa time laga lekin ek baar jab ve set ho gaye to maine kabhi peeche mudakar nahin dekha
 i had not trimmed my hair for several months, so when Mickey Contractor said that i should trim my hair during the shoot of Bazaar India, i thought at the time whether i should really do it? i started trimming my hair before i could react, and i couldn't stop myself from smiling
 maine kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki main apane jivan main is prakaar kaa mekaover karaayuungi lekin mujhe lagata he ki jivan shaayad yahi he
 'view this post on instagramtook me a while to get used to having little hair
 But once that set in, there was no looking back (literally!) 😄 It has been months since I’ve even needed a ‘trim’
 So, during the @bazaarindia shoot when @mickeycontractor said that i needed one, my first thought was, "really ??"
 Before i could react, he was all set – armed with an eyebrow scissor, ready to go at it! i couldn’t stop smiling
 Never thought I'd get a makeover of sorts like this, but i guess it's # mynewnormal

 But no major face of BJP came from the center in this party
 yah dilachasp he ki mufti mohammad ne jammu-kashmir kii bajaay dilli ke paanch sitara hotel ashok main yah aayojan kiya
 It is being said that if there is a problem in reaching political friends till Srinagar, Iftar's hideout was made in Delhi itself

 However, everyone was invited if sources agreed
 mufti kii is party main jammu-kashmir ke up mukhyamantri nirmal singh jarur shaamil hue
 But it is very possible that an attempt has been made by the BJP to give the message that the coalition of power in the state is on track
 haalanki kendriya str ke kisi bijepi netaa kii gairmaujuudagi ye bhi ishaara kar rahi he ki rajya main algaavvaadiyon ke prati mufti mohammad kii nitiyon se wo sahamat bhi nahin he

 etorni general mukul rohtagi ne sarkaar se kaha he ki dilli kaa jamiya milia islamia koi alpsankhyak sanghathan nahin he kyonki isaki sthapana sansad ke ek adhinium se hui he
 Rohatgi had told the Supreme Court just a few days ago that the purpose of the law was not that Aligarh Muslim University should be a minority university
 samajha jaataa he ki etorni general ne maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ko di gai apni kanoonee raay main 1967 ke ucchtam nyaayalay ke ek faisle kaa bhi zikr kiya he jisamen kaha gaya he ki takneekee taur par aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay koi alpsankhyak sanstha nahin he or yahi usul jamiya milia islamia par bhi lagu hota he
 The Ministry of Human Resource Development had approached the Law Ministry for a legal opinion on the issue
 iske baad kanoon mantralay ne rohtagi se kanoonee raay maangi thi
 The National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions (NCMEI) declared Jamia Millia Islamia as a religious minority institution a few years ago
 tippaniyan On the basis of this order, Jamia Millia Islamia abolished reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes and fixed 50 percent seats for Muslim candidates in each course
 kanoon mantralay ke sutron ne jamiya milia islamia adhinium, 1988 ke anuchhed 7 kaa hawala diya jisamen kaha gaya he ki ‘‘vishvavidhyalay kisi bhi ling or kisi bhi nasl, jati, yaa varg ke liye khulaa rahegaa, or kisi shikshak yaa chaatr ke rup main daakhile ke liye paatr banane ke liye kisi vyakti par dharmik aasthaa yaa peshey kii kasuti lagu karnaa vishvavidhyalay ke liye vaid nahin hoga

 It is understood that the Attorney General in his legal opinion given to the Ministry of Human Resource Development has also referred to a judgment of the Supreme Court of 1967 stating that Aligarh Muslim University is technically not a minority institution and that is the principle of Jamia
 Milia also applies to Islamia
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ne is mudde par kanoonee raay ke liye kanoon mantralay se sampark kiya tha
 The Law Ministry then sought a legal opinion from Rohatgi
 rashtriya alpsankhyak shaikshik sanstha ayog (ensiemiai) ne kuch saal pehle jamiya milia islamia ko ek dharmik alpsankhyak sanstha ke rup main ghoshit kiya tha
 The comments is aadesh ke aadhaar par jamiya milia islamia ne anusuchit jati, anusuchit janajati or anya pichde virgon ke liye aarakshan khatm kar diya tha or prayek paathyakram main 50 pratishat siten muslim ummidavaaron ke liye niyat kar di thi
 Sources in the Law Ministry cited Article 7 of the Jamia Millia Islamia Act, 1988 stating that "the University shall be open to any gender and any race, caste, or class, and as a teacher or student It will not be valid for the university to apply the criteria of religious faith or profession to a person to be eligible for admission

 Shivpal Singh Yadav said, 'no one from Jaswantnagar has defeated me in elections
 jaswantnagar kii janata hamaare saath he
 If my membership ends, i will contest from Jaswantnagar Assembly seat, whatever the face of the Samajwadi Party
 ' shivpal ke is elaan se saaf ho gaya he ki ab chachaa or bhattije kii ladaai nae mode par aa gai he
 In the beginning of the month, Samajwadi Party wrote a letter to the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly about the termination of Shivpal Yadav's membership

 Now that both the party and the family is broken, the battle will be interesting if elections are held on Jaswantnagar seat

 BLOCKBUSTER! - taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) November 12, 2017 vitt mantri arun jetaliapane sahyogi rajya mantri jayant sinha ke saath is maheene ke aakhir main pesh hone valebjatki antim taiyaari main lage hue hai
 People have high hopes from this budget of Modi government and people from every section are focusing on that
 aaie jaanane kii koshish karte hai ki aakhir is bajet main 5 kya khaas baaten ho sakati hai
 1
 is baat kii puri sambhaavna he ki is bajet main jetali diarect taxon ke sudhaar par dhyaan denge
 Among the countries of Asia, India is the country that collects the highest tax
 jetali is ore dhyaan de rahe hai or ek vivekpurna tex vyavastha karne ja rahe hai
 Everyone will benefit from this as the income tax rates will come down
 ummid kii ja sakati he ki jetali tex main 50,000 rupee se lekar ek lakh rupee kii kami karenge
 But with this some discounts can also be stopped
 inakam tex main chhot dene ke peeche kaaran yah he ki sarkaar chaahati he ki logon kii aay bade taaki ve zyada kharch kar saken jisase menuphaccharing sector ko badhaava mili
 2
 piem modi kaa sapana he ki desh main rajmargon kaa jaal bichaaya jaae
 For this, Jaitley will announce huge amount for infrastructure related projects
 iskaa phayda janata ko bhi hoga kyonki sarkaar in pariyojnaon ke liye dhan jutaney ke liye bade paimaane par tex free baandon kii ghoshnaa karegi
 By putting money in these bonds, you will not only get tax exemption, but you will also be able to earn good interest
 inase sarkaar ko bhi kaaphi dhan milegaa
 3
 bharat sarkaar or railway ke paas bahut aisi zaminein he jo khaali padi hai
 The government can lease them and also sell some through auctions
 isse sarkaar ko dhan to milegaa hi, janata tex kii maar se batch jaaegi
 4
 tambaakoo utpaadon par tex bad saktaa he khaskar bidi par
 In addition, taxes on expensive products used in toiletries may increase
 sharaab par kuch or tex lag saktaa he
 5
 sarkaar bainkon ke share bechney kii bhi ghoshnaa kar sakati he
 The government may announce to reduce its stake in public sector banks to 52 per cent
 isse rajasav ghate par lagaam to kasega hi, bank bhi majboot honge
 6
 arun jetali ne november maheene main kaha tha ki vah amiron ko sabsidi dene ke khilaaf hai
 Therefore, there is every possibility that the subsidy available in LPG will not be available to the rich
 sambhawatah sarkaar iske liye kul aay kaa sahaara legi
 That is, according to the income of the people, they will get subsidy in gas
 isse sarkaar ko kaaphi bachat hogi

 At Edgbaston, as soon as Ramdin reached his century, he took out a piece of paper from his pocket, which was written in English, 'yah viv talk nah'
 iskaa matlab he viv ab kya kahoge? ramdin ne bich maidan main khadey hokar is kaagaj ke tukade ko media centre kii disha main dikhaaya, jis par prasarankarta company ke cameraman ne focus bhi kiya
 Ramdin was strongly criticized after Richards lost the Trent Bridge Test
 ramdin ne kaha ki richards kii ore se kii gai tippanee se unhen kaaphi chot pahunchi thi
 This is why he became emotional after scoring a century
 ramdin ne kaha, 'sar viv ne mere bare main media main kuch kaha tha or mujhe laga ki main thodaa bhavuk ho gaya tha
 i sat doing it all in excitement '
 'vah westeindies ke mahaan khilaadi hai or main ab bhi unki izzat karata hum
 His statement hurt me a bit, but i worked hard and i criticized the critics with my batting
 'ullekhneey he ki ramdin kii england daure par team main vaapasi hui he
 Ramdin was able to score 56 runs in four innings of the first two Tests on this tour but he remained unbeaten on 107 runs on Sunday

 This event is historical and unprecedented
 yah keval donon netaaon ke bich kii najdiki ko hi pradarshit nahin karata balki piem modi or trump ke bich kii personal chemistry or dosti ko dikhaata he
 On Sunday, the White House said that the US President would participate in the mega event Howdy Modi on September 22 in Houston, Texas
 yah donon netaaon ke bich is saal kii teesri mulaakaat he
 Earlier, the two leaders met on August 26 at the G7 Summit in France

 is puure vivaad main koi vijeta banakar niklaa he to vah he lalit modi
 Montinigro's beauty has added even more to this victory of Lalit Modi
 jis vyakti se jude maamle main chah dinon tak pradhanmantri bol nahin sake, us vyakti kii nazar se dekhiye to antim attahas kaa adhikari vahi he
 Lalit Modi is smiling like a winner even during the two governments
 un par kisi bhi adaalat main koi aarope sabit nahin hua he isliye unki tulana filmon ke kisi aaleeshaan khalanaayak se bilkul hi nahin kar sakate hai
 But leave the hero in front of Lalit Modi, who has been refusing to come to India for five years, there is no Singham or Shinde who will create a moment of fear on his cool face
 ve vahaan king saise life ji rahe hai or ye yahaan unhen lekar pyaade kii tarah bhid rahe hai
 The UPA government got four years, it has been more than a year since the NDA government, but Lalit Modi is fearless
 agar lalit nirdosh hai to kam se kam insaaf kaa takaaza itnaa to banataa hi he ki jin logon ne maasoom or bekasoor lalit ko maa bharti kii mitti se dur kiya he unke kilaaf maamla darj ho or unhen jail bheja jaae
 Nobody says this
 kya aapane aisa kuch bayaan suna ki intazaar kiijie maheene do maheene main lalit modi ko pravartan nideshaalay or rajasav intelligence nideshaalay ke darvaaze par laa denge
 Rather, BJP Vice President Shyam Jaju said in the program of Nidhi Vice Chancellor, 'lalit Modi is available there with the permission of law
 idi ke liye uplabdh hai
 Who is called a fugitive
 jo uplabdh nahin he use kaha jaataa he
 They are available with the permission of the court
 idi ne shikaayat nahin kii he ki wo hamaare liye uplabdh nahin hai
 Now he has to investigate where and where not, the law gives him freedom
 shyaam jaju bijepi ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh hai
 So does the Modi government also believe that Lalit Modi is in London under the given freedom of law
 unka vahaan hona galat nahin he
 Experts in the cricket world rightly say that it is not easy to lay hands on Lalit Modi
 lalit modi ke ek twit se congress ke ek mantri kaa istipha ho jaataa he, ek bayaan se sushamaa ke saath-saath vasundhara raaje shaq ke ghere main aa jaati hai magar lalit modi ko koi chunauti nahin detaa
 Keep writing fine essays but in front of his fine management everything faded
 vasundhara raaje ke maamle par bijepi ne apni chuppi tod di
 The party's national spokesperson in Delhi, Sundhashu, said that Vasundhara ji had accepted that she had close family ties with Mr
 Modi
 is vishay ko unhone kabhi deny nahin kiya
 The authenticity of the documents is not yet verified
 doosraa, jo unke putr or bhaajapa saansad shri dushyant ke company main nivesh kaa vishay he, to ye koi nayaa vishay nahin he
 All these facts are self-evident in the return of income tax and in his affidavit while filing the nomination of MP
 to ye chiz pehle se hi saarvajanik sangyaan main he
 Even this subject was brought to the notice of the High Court and it was not considered for consideration
 parivaarwaad or paariwarik sambandh ek he yaa alag-alag ye aap sanskrit or hindi ke teacher se puch lijiega
 Familyism is an issue in politics, but family relations seems to have become a certificate
 is lihaaz se paariwarik sambandh khandaani na hote hue bhi kuch kanoonee tip lagata he
 If Vasundhara Raje and Lalit Modi have family ties then why are both speaking separately about the affidavit
 vasundhara ne us halafname ke bare main ek hi line kaha he ki mujhe nahin pataa
 Lalit Modi says that he is deposited in a London court
 pataa nahin kyon inkaar kar rahi hai
 Is it possible to get an answer as to why the Vasundhara Raje has given an affidavit to the Indian agencies on the condition that they do not know as the leader of the opposition? kya bijepi yah maanati he ki halafanama dena galat nahin he
 Who will investigate the affidavit given
 bijepi ko isamen kuch bhi bhrashtachar nahin dikhataa he
 Sundashu Trivedi said in whose time Lalit Modi was corrupted
 sundhashu ji ke is bayaan se jab bhrashtachar hua he tab is aadhaar par vasundhara kaa lalit modi ke saath paariwarik sambandh nibhaane ke naam par halafanama dena kya bhrashtachari ko bachaana nahin he
 BJP says it is ridiculous to question Congress
 congress rose pravaktaa badal-badal kar vahi sawaal kar rahi he
 On Friday, Jairam Ramesh asked that in 5 days, the party has asked 34 questions
 jairam ramesh pradhanmantri ke yoga ke asana ke zariye nishaanaa banaate hue kaha ki pradhanmantri ke maun kii dahaad sara desh sun rahaa he
 The comments ham ummid karte hai ki yoga diwas ke baad pradhanmantri jo ek asana main baithe hue hai, kaan band he, naak band he, aankh band he, munh band he
 Together
 iskaa naam lalitasana he
 Those who have been sitting on Lalitasan for the last four days, we expect the Prime Minister to visit Lalitasan in the real world after International Yoga Day
 ramesh ne kaha ki lalit modi cond kaa maamla galat vyavhaar kaa nahin balki andruni santh ganth kaa maamla he
 Chhota Modi and Bada Modi have nexus
 ramesh apane aarope main udyogpati gautam adani ko ghaseet laae or gujarat cricket sangh main jo pradhanmantri, amit shah or gautam adani ke bich nexs bana tha wo phool banakar khil rahaa he
 The Prime Minister is also involved in this
 sipiem netaa vrinda karaat ne bhi isi tarah kaa ek lekh indian express main likhaa he
 The Congress says that there is only one way to save the Modi government and the monsoon session
 istipha
 BJP has said that there will be no resignation
 rajasthan bijepi ne dushyant singh kii company main lalit modi ke saath hue len dein ko sahi bataaya or kaha ki inakam tex main paise ko dikhaaya gaya he or tids diya gaya he
 Should we assume that the BJP has given the final answer by accusing the family relations and the Congress? do do sarkaron ke daur main bhi lalit modi vijeta kii tarah muskura rahe hai
 No charges have been proved on him in any court, so he cannot be compared at all to any plush villain of films
 magar paanch saal se bharat aane se manaa kar rahe lalit modi ke saamne nayak chhodiye koi singhm yaa shinde jaisaa daaroga bhi nahin jo unke bindaas chehre par pal bhar ke liye khuf paidaa kar de
 They are living a king size life there and they are fighting like pawns with them here
 upie kii sarkaar ko chaar saal mila, endie kii sarkaar ke ek saal se zyaada ho gaye magar lalit modi bemauf hai
 If Lalit is innocent, at least justice is done so that the people who have taken innocent and innocent Lalit off the soil of Mother Bharati should file a case and be sent to jail
 yah bhi to koi nahin kahata
 Have you heard such a statement that wait in two months, Lalit Modi will be brought to the door of Enforcement Directorate and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence
 balki bijepi ke upaadhyaksh shyaam jaju ne nidhi kulapati ke kaarykram main kaha, 'lalit modi kanoon kii anumati lekar vahaan uplabdh hai
 Are available for ED
 bhagoda kise kaha jaataa he
 What is not available is called
 wo court kii anumati se uplabdh hai
 The ED has not complained that they are not available to us
 ab usko jaanch kahaan rahakar kerani he, kahaan nahin, kanoon usko isaki swatantraaa detaa he
 Shyam Jaju is the bjp's national vice president
 to kya modi sarkaar yah bhi maanati he ki lalit modi kanoon kii di hui swatantraaa ke tahat landan main hai
 It is not wrong for them to be there
 cricket kii duniya ke jaankaar thik hi kehete hai ki lalit modi par haath daalana aasaan nahin he
 a tweet from Lalit Modi leads to the resignation of a Congress minister, with a statement that Sushma as well as Vasundhara Raje fall under suspicion but does not challenge Lalit Modi
 likhte rahiye lalit niabandh magar unke lalit prabandh ke saamne sab feekaa
 The BJP broke its silence on the case of Vasundhara Raje
 dilli main party ke rashtriya pravaktaa sundhashu ne kaha ki vasundhara ji ne ye baat sweekaar kii he ki shri modi ji ke saath un logon ke nazadiiki paariwarik sambandh the
 He never denied this subject
 dastavezon kii pramanikta abhi tak satyapit nahin he
 Secondly, which is the subject of investment in the company of his son and BJP MP Mr
 Dushyant, then this is not a new topic
 ye saare tathy inakam tex ke ritern main or saansad kaa namakan bharte samay unke halafname main swatah spasht he
 So this thing is already in public cognizance
 yahaan tak ki is vishay ko ucch nyaayalay ke bhi sangyaan main laayaa gaya or usne use vichaarneey nahin mana tha
 You will ask Sanskrit and Hindi teacher whether familyism and family relations are same or different
 raajnneeti main parivaarwaad ek mudda he lekin paariwarik sambandh lagata he ki certificate ho gaya he
 In this sense, the family relationship seems to be a legal type, despite not being bland
 agar vasundhara raaje or lalit modi ke paariwarik sambandh hai to donon halafname ke bare main alag-alag kyon bol rahe hai
 Vasundhara has said the same line about that affidavit that i do not know
 lalit modi kehete hai ki wo to landan kii court main jamaa he
 Don't know why she is refusing kya paariwarik sambandh bataa dene se yah jawaab mil jaataa he ki netaa vipaksh kii haisiyat se vasundhara raaje ne bhartiya agenciyon ko na pataa chalane kii shart par halafanama kyon diya
 Does BJP believe that giving affidavit is not wrong
 halafanama diya gaya he isaki jaanch koun karegaa
 BJP does not see any corruption in it
 sundhashu trivedi ne kaha lalit modi kaa bhrashtachar kiske kaal main hua
 When corruption has occurred due to this statement of Sundhu Shishu, then giving Vasundhara's affidavit in the name of having a family relationship with Lalit Modi is not to save the corrupt
 bijepi kahati he ki congress kaa sawaal karnaa haasyaaspad he
 The Congress spokesperson is asking the same question every day
 shuukravaar ko jairam ramesh ne poocha ki 5 dinon main party ne 34 sawaal puche hai
 Jairam Ramesh targeted the Prime Minister through yoga rugs and said that the whole country is listening to the roar of the Prime Minister's silence
 tippaniyan We hope that after Yoga Day, the Prime Minister who is sitting in a posture, the ears are closed, the nose is closed, the eyes are closed, the mouth is closed
 ek saath
 Its name is Lalitasana
 jo lalitasana par baithe hue hai pichley chaar dinon se, ham ummid karte hai ki pradhanmantri antarrashtriya yoga diwas ke baad lalitasana se asli duniya main padhaarenge
 Ramesh said that the case of the Lalit Modi scandal is not a case of misbehavior but a matter of internal ties
 chota modi or bada modi main nexs he
 Ramesh dragged industrialist Gautam Adani in his charge and the nexus that had formed between the Prime Minister, Amit Shah and Gautam Adani in the Gujarat Cricket Association is blossoming into a flower
 pradhanmantri bhi isamen shaamil hai
 CPM leader Vrinda Karat has also written a similar article in the Indian Express
 congress kahati he ki modi sarkaar or monsoon satr bachaane ke liye ek hi rasta he
 Resignation
 bijepi ne kah diya he ki istipha nahin hoga
 The Rajasthan BJP justified the transaction with Lalit Modi in Dushyant Singh's company and said that the money has been shown in the income tax and TDS has been given
 kya paariwarik sambandh or congress par aarope laga dene se maan liya jaae ki bijepi ne antim jawaab de diya he? But leave the hero in front of Lalit Modi, who has been refusing to come to India for five years, there is no Singham or Shinde who will create a moment of fear on his cool face
 ve vahaan king saise life ji rahe hai or ye yahaan unhen lekar pyaade kii tarah bhid rahe hai
 The UPA government got four years, it has been more than a year since the NDA government, but Lalit Modi is fearless
 agar lalit nirdosh hai to kam se kam insaaf kaa takaaza itnaa to banataa hi he ki jin logon ne maasoom or bekasoor lalit ko maa bharti kii mitti se dur kiya he unke kilaaf maamla darj ho or unhen jail bheja jaae
 Nobody says this
 kya aapane aisa kuch bayaan suna ki intazaar kiijie maheene do maheene main lalit modi ko pravartan nideshaalay or rajasav intelligence nideshaalay ke darvaaze par laa denge
 Rather, BJP Vice President Shyam Jaju said in the program of Nidhi Vice Chancellor, 'lalit Modi is available there with the permission of law
 idi ke liye uplabdh hai
 Who is called a fugitive
 jo uplabdh nahin he use kaha jaataa he
 They are available with the permission of the court
 idi ne shikaayat nahin kii he ki wo hamaare liye uplabdh nahin hai
 Now he has to investigate where and where not, the law gives him freedom
 shyaam jaju bijepi ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh hai
 So does the Modi government also believe that Lalit Modi is in London under the given freedom of law
 unka vahaan hona galat nahin he
 Experts in the cricket world rightly say that it is not easy to lay hands on Lalit Modi
 lalit modi ke ek twit se congress ke ek mantri kaa istipha ho jaataa he, ek bayaan se sushamaa ke saath-saath vasundhara raaje shaq ke ghere main aa jaati hai magar lalit modi ko koi chunauti nahin detaa
 Keep writing fine essays but in front of his fine management everything faded
 vasundhara raaje ke maamle par bijepi ne apni chuppi tod di
 The party's national spokesperson in Delhi, Sundhashu, said that Vasundhara ji had accepted that she had close family ties with Mr
 Modi
 is vishay ko unhone kabhi deny nahin kiya
 The authenticity of the documents is not yet verified
 doosraa, jo unke putr or bhaajapa saansad shri dushyant ke company main nivesh kaa vishay he, to ye koi nayaa vishay nahin he
 All these facts are self-evident in the return of income tax and in his affidavit while filing the nomination of MP
 to ye chiz pehle se hi saarvajanik sangyaan main he
 Even this subject was brought to the notice of the High Court and it was not considered for consideration
 parivaarwaad or paariwarik sambandh ek he yaa alag-alag ye aap sanskrit or hindi ke teacher se puch lijiega
 Familyism is an issue in politics, but family relations seems to have become a certificate
 is lihaaz se paariwarik sambandh khandaani na hote hue bhi kuch kanoonee tip lagata he
 If Vasundhara Raje and Lalit Modi have family ties then why are both speaking separately about the affidavit
 vasundhara ne us halafname ke bare main ek hi line kaha he ki mujhe nahin pataa
 Lalit Modi says that he is deposited in a London court
 pataa nahin kyon inkaar kar rahi hai
 Is it possible to get an answer as to why the Vasundhara Raje has given an affidavit to the Indian agencies on the condition that they do not know as the leader of the opposition? kya bijepi yah maanati he ki halafanama dena galat nahin he
 Who will investigate the affidavit given
 bijepi ko isamen kuch bhi bhrashtachar nahin dikhataa he
 Sundashu Trivedi said in whose time Lalit Modi was corrupted
 sundhashu ji ke is bayaan se jab bhrashtachar hua he tab is aadhaar par vasundhara kaa lalit modi ke saath paariwarik sambandh nibhaane ke naam par halafanama dena kya bhrashtachari ko bachaana nahin he
 BJP says it is ridiculous to question Congress
 congress rose pravaktaa badal-badal kar vahi sawaal kar rahi he
 On Friday, Jairam Ramesh asked that in 5 days, the party has asked 34 questions
 jairam ramesh pradhanmantri ke yoga ke asana ke zariye nishaanaa banaate hue kaha ki pradhanmantri ke maun kii dahaad sara desh sun rahaa he
 The comments ham ummid karte hai ki yoga diwas ke baad pradhanmantri jo ek asana main baithe hue hai, kaan band he, naak band he, aankh band he, munh band he
 Together
 iskaa naam lalitasana he
 Those who have been sitting on Lalitasan for the last four days, we expect the Prime Minister to visit Lalitasan in the real world after International Yoga Day
 ramesh ne kaha ki lalit modi cond kaa maamla galat vyavhaar kaa nahin balki andruni santh ganth kaa maamla he
 Chhota Modi and Bada Modi have nexus
 ramesh apane aarope main udyogpati gautam adani ko ghaseet laae or gujarat cricket sangh main jo pradhanmantri, amit shah or gautam adani ke bich nexs bana tha wo phool banakar khil rahaa he
 The Prime Minister is also involved in this
 sipiem netaa vrinda karaat ne bhi isi tarah kaa ek lekh indian express main likhaa he
 The Congress says that there is only one way to save the Modi government and the monsoon session
 istipha
 BJP has said that there will be no resignation
 rajasthan bijepi ne dushyant singh kii company main lalit modi ke saath hue len dein ko sahi bataaya or kaha ki inakam tex main paise ko dikhaaya gaya he or tids diya gaya he
 Should we assume that the BJP has given the final answer by accusing the family relations and the Congress? agar lalit nirdosh hai to kam se kam insaaf kaa takaaza itnaa to banataa hi he ki jin logon ne maasoom or bekasoor lalit ko maa bharti kii mitti se dur kiya he unke kilaaf maamla darj ho or unhen jail bheja jaae
