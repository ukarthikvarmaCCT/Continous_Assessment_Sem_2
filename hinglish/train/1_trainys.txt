 Board exams are over and the State Board has started declaring the results of the examinations as well
 board pariksha ke baad sabase pramukh padaav he course or kisi college kaa sahi chayan
 If you are also at this stage then you must make the right choice of college or course
 koi bhi yah chunaav karne se pehle kai baton kaa dhyaan rakhana hoga
 If you too have to take a decision about college or any subject, then take care of these things
 salaah len-kisi bhi kshetra main apane kariyar banane se pehle us kshetra se jude jaankaron se baat karen
 First of all, according to your interest, talk to the consultant to choose the college, course and then choose the career
 agar aapane kisi course yaa college ke liye opshan dekh liye hai to aap us kshetra ke senior vyakti se baat karen or us kshetra ke bhavishya kii sambhaavnaaon ke bare main jaan len
 Think about a career rather than a place - many big corporate companies are in big cities and have to live in the same cities to work in them
 agar aap bhi aise kshetra main hai, jahaan aapako kisi duusare shahar main vikalp milte hai to shahar ke bare main naa sochen
 Also make a change to make a career
 haalanki iske saath hi apni nijee paristhitiyon kaa bhi dhyaan rakhen
 Make contact - If you have started studying or are about to start studying, then get in touch with the people working in your interest field
 yah sampark aapaki aane vaale vakt main madad kar sakate hai or aapako isse kaaphi baarikiyaan seekhney ko milti he
 Don't get influenced - When it comes to choosing a career, friends, relatives, and parents start motivating them to choose a particular career option
 iske peeche logon ke alag alag tark hote hai
 But instead of paying attention to these people, take care of your interest and talk to a knowledgeable person
 isliye, jab aap kariyar vikalp chun rahe hon to kisi ke sujhaavon ke prabhaav main na aaen
 Rather, choose career options according to your ability, ability, interest and knowledge
 future kaa dhyaan rakhen-agar aap kisi aise kariyar vikalp ko chunate hai jiskaa bhavishya nahin he, to aapako dikkat kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Therefore, keep in mind important aspects of an appropriate career choice

 batla house encounter par jahaan bijepi congress ko gherne main lagi he vahiin congress ke bheetar hi is par bavaal machaa hua he
 While Digvijay Singh is adamant on calling it a forgery, Shivraj Patil has given it a real deal
 2008 main hue batla house encounter ke vaqt grahamantri rahe shivaraj patil ne saafe kar diya he ki encounter asli tha or isamen shaq kii koi gunjaaish nahin
 The BJP has demanded an apology from Digvijay Singh after the face of terrorist Abu Rashid who ran from Batla House appeared in the ISIS video
 lekin digvijay singh abhi bhi batla encounter ko na sirf farzi bataane ke apane rukh par qaayam hai balki nyaayik jaanch kii maang par bhi ade hai
 These two voices within the party are troubling the Congress
 haalanki party khud ko digvijay kii zid se alag karti rahi he lekin sanbhal kar
 Congress media head Randeep Surjewala says, "the government at that time took a decision based on the facts which were approved by both the court and the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)
" digvijay singh kaa ham sammaan karte hai, unki alag bhaavana ho sakati he

 Digvijay Singh has always been talking outside the party line on the issue of Batla House but still his place in the party is not harmed

 Shivraj Patil, who was the Home Minister during the 2008 Batla House encounter, has made it clear that the encounter was real and there is no scope for doubt

 Though the party has been separating itself from Digvijay's stubbornness, but it has to be sustained

 There is doubt whether they do this only on the instigation of the party or whether they do not trust their UPA government

 Citizenship Amendment passed in Lok Sabha: Separate opinion on the support of the bill in Billadu, after Pawan Verma, now the citizenship amendment bill has passed in Lok Sabha and fellow Janata Dal (U) in NDA in Bihar supported this bill is
 lekin isi faisle par jadyu do faad hoti najar aa rahi he
 After party vice-president Prashant Kishore, Pawan Verma has now opposed the bill and has asked Nitish Kumar to reconsider the decision
 jadyu pravaktaa pawan kumaar verma ne mangalvaar is bare main twit kiya
 He wrote, 'I appeal to Nitish Kumar to reconsider support for the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) in the Rajya Sabha
 ye bill puri tarah se asanvaidhanik he or desh kii ekta ke khilaaf he
 These bills are also against the original ideas of JDU, Gandhiji would have opposed it completely '
 i urge Shri Nitish Kumar to reconsider support to the # cabin the Rajya Sabha
 The Bill is unconstitutional, discriminatory, and against the unity and harmony of the country, apart from being against the secular principles of the JDU
 Gandhiji would have strongly disapproved it
 - Pavan k Varma (@pavank_varma)december 10, 2019gauratlab he ki loksabhaa main jadyu ne naagarikta sanshodhan bill kaa samarthan kiya tha
 JDU has a total of 16 mps in the Lok Sabha
 jabaki rajyasabha main jadyu ke kul 6 saansad hai
 Prashant Kishore had also protested against the bill by tweeting Prasad Kishore, vice president and political strategist of JDU before VP
 prashanth kishor ne twit kar likhaa tha ki ‘jadyu ke dwaara naagarikta sanshodhan bill kaa samarthan karnaa kaaphi niraashajanak he
 Supporting JDU in this matter also violates the party's constitution and is against Gandhi's views
 ’disappointed to see JDU supporting # cabthat discriminates right of citizenship on the basis of religion
 It's incongruous with the party's constitution that carries the word secular thrice on the very first page and the leadership that is supposedly guided by Gandhian ideals
 — Prashant Kishor (@prashantkishor)december 9, 2019aapako bataa den ki loksabhaa main naagarikta sanshodhan bill bade bahumat se paas ho gaya he, lekin abhi rajyasabha main bill paas hona baaki he
 This bill will be introduced in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, 6 hours time has been allotted for debate on it
 is bill ke anusaar, pakistan-afghanistan-bangladesh se aane vaale hindu, jain, buddha, isai, sikh or parsi nagarikon ko bharat main naagarikta milane main aasaani hogi
 The Opposition is opposing the bill and calling it against the Constitution of India

 The Modi government has introduced a bill against triple talaq in the Lok Sabha
 kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne guuruuvaar ko bill pesh kiya, to RJD,BJD samet kai vipakshi partiyon ne bill main sajaa ke praavdhaan kaa virodh kiya
 But Congress, the largest opposition party in the House, is with the government on the issue
 congress teen talaak bill kaa virodh nahin karegi, naa hi koi sanshodhan laaegi
 Congress will make only three suggestions, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said that the party will support the triple talaq bill, although some suggestions will definitely be put before the government
 congress kii ore se ye do bade suzav de sakati hai
 1
 talaak ke baad muslim mahila ko kitna bhatta milegaa, patni ko pati kii aay kaa kitna hissaa milegaa
 What will be its formula? 2
 If the husband goes to jail for three years, how will the wife get the allowance
 sutron kii maane, to party adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii aguwai main buudhvaar der raat congressiyon is mudde par baithak kii
 According to sources, the Congress had appeared in favor of the triple talaq bill in the meeting
 aise main mumkin he ki is bill ko paas karwaane main centre sarkaar ko koi dikkat nahin aani chahie
 Randeep Surjewala said that the Congress has always judged the issue of triple talaq or talaq-e-biddat on the basis that the protection of women's rights and women's equality should be in a universal manner
 unhone kaha ki congress ne teen talaak ke bare main ucchtam nyaayalay ke nirnay kaa swaagat kiya tha
 He said that Congress supports the law prohibiting triple talaq
 hamaara yah maananaa he ki mahilaon ke sanghathan or muslim sanghathanon kii raay ke anusaar is kanoon ko or pukhta banane kii aavashyaktaa he
 Mahila Congress president Sushmita Dev said that the proposed bill talks about giving alimony to Muslim women
 kintu gujaarey ke nirdhaaran kaa taur tarika nahin bataaya gaya he, sarkaar ko is bare main vyakhya kerani chahie
 Sushmita said that under a 1986 Muslim Women Act, women getting divorced are getting alimony
 kahin nae kanoon ke kaaran unhen yah guzaara bhatta milanaa band na ho jaae
 Some opposition parties, including Owaisi, opposed when the bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha, some opposition parties including RJD, BJD opposed the provision of punishment
 AIMIM pramukh asaduddin ovaisi ne bhi is bill kaa virodh kiya
 He said that this bill is not in accordance with the constitution
 ovaisi ne kaha ki talaak e biddat gaiyrkanoonee he, gharelu hinsa ko lekar bhi kanoon pehle se maujuud he phir isi tarah ke ek or kanoon kii jarurat kya he?kaisaa hoga bill?gauratlab he ki sarkaar ‘da muslim vimen protection of ritis in marij act’ naam se is vidheyak ko laa rahi he
 This law will only apply to three divorces (INSTANT TALAQ, ie divorce-e-biddat)
 is kanoon ke baad koi bhi muslim pati agar patni ko teen talaak degaa to wo gaiyr-kanoonee hoga
 Henceforth, three divorces granted in any form, whether oral or written or in a message, would be invalid
 jo bhi teen talaak degaa, usko teen saal kii sajaa or jurmaana ho saktaa he
 That is, giving triple talaq would be a non-bailable and cognizable offense
 isamen magistrate tay karegaa ki kitna jurmaana hoga
 PM Narendra Modi had formed a group of ministers to legislate on triple talaq, which included Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Ravi Shankar Prasad, PP Chaudhary and Jitendra Singh

 Piyush Chawlaki, defending his low score by defeating the last three-time champions Australia by 38 runs in the practice cricket match here, with a beautiful leg break and the clever bowling of Harbhajan Singh, showed a tremendous view of the strength of his spin attack before the World Cup
 bharat ke liye haalanki madhyakram kii naakaami chintaa kaa vishay bana hua he kyonki tas jitkar pehle ballebaaji karne kii utarimhendra singh dhoniteam main se keval virendra sahvaag (56 gend par 54 ran) hi gendbaajon kaa datakar saamana kar paye
 No half-century partnership was played by India and his entire team 44
 3 over main 214 ran par simat gayi
 Chawla took four for 31 and Harbhajan took three wickets for 15 runs and proved that score too big for Australia
 austrailian team ke liye acchhee baat yah rahi ki chot se ubarne ke baad vaapasi karne vaale captain riki ponting (85 gend par 57 ran) ballebaaji kaa paryaapt abhyaas karne main safal rahe
 Apart from him, only the opening pair of Tim Paine (37) and Shane Watson (33) managed to get some runs, but the entire team lost 37 after losing the last nine wickets for 58 runs
 5 over main 176 ran par dher ho gayi
 Chawla once showed more faith in his googly, but today he offered a life-style model of leg break and slider and played a key role in destroying the Australian middle order
 watasan or pen ne pehle wicket ke liye 51 ran kii saajhedaari karke austrailia ko dhamaakedaar shuruyaat di
 Ponting and Penn added 67 runs for the second wicket, but only a fall of wickets was seen after that
 ponting ne aate hi aar aswin par teen chauke jamaaye lekin iske baad spinneron visheshkar chawla ke saamne ran banane main unhen bhi khaasi pareshaani hui
 Only once did the ball show the boundary line for 19 overs in the middle
 austrailia haalanki ek wicket par 118 ran ke score tak acchhee sthiti main dikh rahaa tha lekin chawla kaa jaadu chalane ke baad uskaa madhyakram buree tarah ladkadaa gaya
 It was started by Yuvraj with the pen out, after which Chawla bowled Michael Clarke (0) on a great leg break and then showed Cameron White and David Hussey the pavilion on consecutive balls
 calum fagarusan ko jeevandaan mila lekin vah iskaa phayda nahin uthaa paye or agle over main chawla ke jaal main funs gayi
 Harbhajan Singh ensured India's victory by dismissing one end Ponting, Mitchell Johnson (15) and Jason Krejza

 Yusuf Pathan also had to spend some time at the crease to play freely
 unhone 39 gend par 32 ran banaaye jisamen do chakke shaamil hai
 Barring Sehwag, no Indian batsman has been able to stand up to the Australian fast bowlers
 viraat kohli (21),captain mahendra singh dhoni(11) or suresh raina (12) sabhi ne kuch samay krij par bitaayaa lekin jab team ko jarurat thi tab unhone apane wicket ganvaaye
 India's poor performance in batting was that not a single 50-run partnership was played for him
 sabase badi bhagidaari nauven wicket ke liye 49 ran kii pathan or aar aswin (naabad 25) ne kii
 When Kohli stepped to the crease, he was confident of his form in the five-match series against South Africa
 unhone aate hi lee or bolinger donon ke lagaataar over main chauke jamaaye
 When it seemed that Kohli would play a big innings, he caught David Hussey at point on a full length ball from Hastings
 austrailian captain riki ponting ne hestings se do over karwaane ke baad spinner jaisan kreja ko gend thama di lekin unki team ko teesri safalataa baayen haath ke tej gendbaaj mishael janson ne dilaayi
 Yuvraj Singh's poor form continued
 unhone janson ke bounsar par wicketiper tim pen ko kaich thamane se pehle saat gend par keval ek ran banaaya
 The bowling powerplay proved crucial for Australia as they conceded only 12 runs and took two wickets
 captain dhoni apni khyaati ke saath nyaay nahin kar paye or hestings kii gend ko apane wicket par khelkar pavilion laute
 This brought the score to 101 for four
 sahvaag ne haalanki kreja ke khilaaf aakraamak tevar apanaaye lekin aakhir main isi aaf spinner ne unhen out kiya
 He completed his half-century by hitting a six off Kreja's ball, but on the next ball, the off-spinner took the edge of his bat and took it into the wickets
 sahvaag ne apni pari main aath chauke or ek chakka lagaaya
 Lee would have got Pathan's wicket in the next over as well but Penn leveled his easy catch but the pacer scattered Piyush Chawla's balls two balls later
 pathan jab 13 ran par the tab janson kii gend par shen watasan ne unhen jeevandaan diya
 Ponting handed David Hussey in the 39th over and this part time spinner did not disappoint him
 pathan ne unka swaagat do chhakkon se kiya lekin hassi ne isi over main is khatarnaak ballebaaj ko out kar diya
 India reached beyond 200 runs thanks to Ashwin and Ashish Nehra (19) who added 27 runs for the final wicket

 Book: The Sunil Gavaskar Omnibus: Sunny Days, Idols, One Day Wonders Publication: Rupa Publication Writer: Sunil Gavaskar Price: 395 Rupees: Paperback 2015 Cricket World Cup is going on and it is also a great opportunity for cricket fans to read the three books of Little Master Sunil Gavaskar together
 is
 sunil gavaskarki teen kitaaben roopa publication ek kathasangrah ke rup main lekar aayaa he
 Gavaskar's three popular books 'sunny Days', 'idols' and 'one Day Wonders' have been included in it
 jahaan sani days ke pannon pargavaskarne bachapan se lekar apane puure cricket kariyar ko kramvaar ukera he
 At the same time, he has dedicated 'idols' to 31 contemporary cricketers from all over the world
 to ‘van de vanders’ team india kii sabase yaadgaar van de jeet kaa shandaar sangrah he
 The specialty of the book Sunny Days is that it is not just a compilation of events related to the cricket field, but it tells many aspects related to his life
 iske pehle panne par hi gavaskar ne apane jivan kii sabase vicitra ghatana kaa zikr kiya he
 This incident is related to his birth
 gavaskar janm ke agle din hi aspataal ke karmchaariyon kii vajah se ek machuaaran maa ke bachche se badal gaye
 Gavaskar further wrote on the incident, what would have happened if he had not met back then! However, Gavaskar, known for timing his cover drive, was a bit crude in the publication of this book
 jab is kitaab kaa prakaashan kiya gaya tab wo sar don breadman ke 29 shatakon ke record kii barabari karne kii dahalij par the
 The next series against the West Indies was to be played and during this time he not only equaled it while playing his best Test innings (236 not out) but also broke the record in the next Test
 is siries ke 6 test maichon main unhone 50
 505 runs scored at an average of 50
 siries main unke is shandaar pradarshan kii badaulat unke kitaab kii bikri kaaphi bad gai
 Like cricket, Gavaskar is very proficient in the art of writing, he told it well in his first book, Autobiography Sunny Days
 idlespahali kitaab sani days kii safalataa se prerit hokar unhone agali kitaab ‘idles’ likhi
 According to the name, Gavaskar personally assessed the best cricketers in it
 is kitaab kaa prayek adhyay ek cricketer ko samarpit he
 It features Geoff Boycott, Derek Underwood, Ellen Knott, Ian Botham and Jon Snow from England
 australia se denis lily, jyoff thomson, rodni marsh or chapel bandhuon ko jagah di gai he
 Zaheer Abbas, Javed Miandad, Asif Iqbal and Imran Khan are from Pakistan
 jabaki westeindies se sar gairi sobers, rohan kanhai, endi rabarts or clive loyad jaise cricketer hai
 Here it is surprising that while he gave place to international players from foreign teams, only eight of the 10 Indian cricketers whom he put in his book could play Test matches
 aath test players spin tikdi bedi, prasanna or venkatraghavan ke saath apane bahanoi gundappa vishwanath, kapil dev, mohinder amarnath or sayaid kirmani unki is pratishthit kitaab main jagah bana sake
 While the two cricketers included in the book are Padmakar Shivalkar from Bombay and Rajindra Goel from Haryana
 vaise sahi myne main is kitaab ke content main nayaa kuch bhi nahin tha
 That is, whatever was written did not have the ability to shake the cricketing world
 gavaskar ne is kitaab main shaamil prayek khilaadi kii bataur vyakti or cricketer donon hi rup main prashansa kii he
 However, in this book he also mentioned the most controversial incident of his cricketing life
 yah ghatana 1980 main khele gaye melbern test kii he jab australia ke khilaaf wo maidan chhod kar chale gaye the
 Gavaskar mentioned this entire incident in the book
 wo likhte hai, ‘jab lily kii gend par mujhe out dene ke nirnay ko ampire ne nahin palata to mujhe bahut gussa aayaa kyonki ball mere balle ke bhitari kinare ko lene ke baad pad par lagi thi
 He further wrote, 'while i was passing by Chetan (chauhan), i heard Lily saying one of her abuses
 ise sunate hi maine apana aapa kho diya or chetan ko mere saath maidan se baahar le aayaa
 However, Gavaskar admitted, "it was the most regrettable event of his life
" aaj main yah mahasoos karata hum ki tab mere vyavhaar kaa wo koi sateek kaaran nahin tha or ek khilaadi or team ke captain ke rup main mujhe aisa nahin karnaa chahie tha
 This book by One Day onedersunil Gavaskar is an excellent compilation of field action as well as various events during the Benson Hedges series played in Australia
 gavaskar ne is kitaab ko is dhang se likhaa he ki aap ise baar-baar padhane ko vivash ho uthenge
 You will get lost in it as soon as you start reading it
 jin logon ne gavaskar ko cricket khelte dekha he yaa aaj kii taarikh main internet par uske video dekhen hai is kitaab ko padhate samay unhen aisa jarur lagegaa ki team india unki ankhon ke saamne hi khel rahi he
 Gavaskar has mentioned in this book how the custom department in our country gives preference to foreign cricketers and their passports are checked first while the Indian team players have to wait overseas
 gavaskar ne kai mjedaar palon ko bhi isamen sameta he
 He has described very well how wicketkeeper Sadanand Vishwanath used to eat cheese with the cellophane rapper on the tour
 ek or mjedaar ghatana us match kii he jo newjiland ke khilaaf khelaa gaya
 New Zealand batsman Bruce Blair hit the ball too high during the slog-over in this match, with Srikanth dropping that easy catch
 agali gend par bruce ne phir kaich uchhaala, gend phir shrikant ke paas gai lekin shrikant is baar bhi chook gaye
 Then Captain Gavaskar angrily sent Srikanth to the other end of the field
 thik agali gend par phir bruce ne gend ko phir de maaraa or gend phir shrikant ke paas hi pahunchi lekin is baar nahin chuke
 The book also mentions the final match of the 1985 Champions Trophy played in Sharjah, in which Imran Khan was dismissed for 6 by 14 wickets for 14 runs and captain Kapil Dev said while getting down to field , 'clans force them to fight
 ’ iske baad team india ne puri pakistani team ko 87 ranon par ol out kar diya
 This book is still popular as a valuable heritage among cricket fans

 ) 7wein charan main 59 siton par desh ke kai rajyon main chunaav he lekin bengal kii 9 siton kaa chunaav sabase bada sangram banataa dikh rahaa he
 Here Trinamool Congress and BJP have come face to face with each other
 mangalvaar ko amit shah ke road sho main hui hinsa ke baad buudhvaar ko chunaav ayog ne is tarah ke apane pehle faisle main chunaav prachaar ko tay samay se 20 ghante pehle roak diya
 After this decision, where Mamata Banerjee is clearly saying that the Election Commission is working at the behest of Modi and Shah, on the other hand BJP is also attacking Mamata Banerjee
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne mamata banerjee par loktantr ko khatre main daalane kaa aarope lagaaya he to mamata banerjee kah rahi hai ki jarurat padi to modi ko jail main daalenge
 Mamata Banerjee has been joined by several opposition parties, including the Congress and the Left, over allegations of bias on the Election Commission, although it is important to know here that the Deputy Election Commissioner and Special Observer reported on Bengal clearly stated that the police - Governance is not giving equal opportunity to all candidates, along with TMC leaders are threatening people after May 23
 chunaav ayog kii karrwai par ajtak ne sipiem netaa vrinda karaat or bijepi netaa roopa ganguli se baat kii
 Rupa Ganguly said that her party is very angry at the BJP for taking such a drastic step so late
 puure desh kii para military force ko uthaakar bengal main kyon nahin lagaaya gaya jahaan itani hinsa ho rahi he
 Rupa Ganguly said that Mamata Banerjee should have banned the election campaign because she is abusing in speeches
 ganguli ne kaha ki puraa 7waan charan band hona chahie kyonki pehle hinsa ke kaarnon kaa pataa lagaana jaruri he
 According to Rupa Ganguly, at Vidyasagar College, when students were already showing black flags, putting up banners, then why should the police not know that this should be investigated
 baahar ke logon ko kya pataa ki college ke andar teen get he or uske peeche vidyasagar kii murti lagi he
 The college will have boys from CPM, TMC and Congress who will do this work (breaking the statue)
 vrinda karaat ne chunaav ayog ke faisle ke bare main kaha ki ellection kamishan ko kanoon kii laaj rakhni chahie thi
 After the end of all the three rallies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the ban is being imposed from 10 o'clock on Wednesday night, what if it is not partiality? With this decision, the credibility of the Election Commission decreases, increases or survives, this is a big question
 karaat ne kaha ki chunaav ayog ke maamle main ham kisi dal ke saath nahin hai balki niyam or kanoon ke saath hai
 Who is Mamata Banerjee, who will speak to the Election Commission because she herself has broken many rules
 ellection kamishan kaa jo role hona chahie tha, wo katai nahin he
 The Election Commission is working in full favor
 vrinda karaat ne kaha, chunaav ayog kaa daayitv banataa he ki vah tay kare ki kis prakaar ke juluus nikal sakate hai, kis prakaar ke naare lagaae ja sakate hai
 The Election Commission has specialized photographers and videographers
 uskaa vishesh daayitv he ki jo bhi aadhikarik video he, use puure desh ke saamne laana chahie
 On that basis, you will know what the people of BJP and RSS did and what the people of TMC did
 ellection kamishan kii jimmedaari he ki vah doodh kaa doodh or pani kaa pani kare
 On the action of the Election Commission, Rupa Ganguly said that the biggest loss is to BJP because it will have to stay away from campaigning for 24 hours
 chunaav ayog bengal ke chunaav ko sambhaal nahin paaya he
 Significantly, in view of the ongoing electoral violence in Bengal, the campaign for nine Lok Sabha seats of the state will be closed on May 19, a day before the scheduled date for the next May voting
 chunaav ayog ne buudhvaar ko is aashay kaa aadesh jari karte hue kaha ki bengal main 16 may ko raat das baje se har prakaar kaa prachaar abhiyaan pratibandhit ho jayega
 Deputy Election Commissioner Chandrabhushan Kumar said that this is probably the first time in the history of the country that the Commission had to stop campaigning before the scheduled period in an election in view of electoral violence
 loksabhaa chunaav ke saatven or antim charan main aath rajyon kii 59 siton par 19 may ko hone vaale matdaan main pashchim bengal kii nau siten bhi shaamil hai
 As per the predetermined election schedule, 48 hours before the polling for this phase, the election campaign will come to a halt at 5 pm on May 17, but citing the deteriorating law and order situation in Bengal, the commission a day before the scheduled time in the state, 16 Prohibition of any form of election has been banned from 10 pm on May
 yah pratibandh rajya kii sabhi 9 siton par 19 may ko shaam paanch baje matdaan puraa hone tak jari rahegaa
 Chandrabhushan Kumar made it clear that after the statue of social reformer Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar was demolished in Kolkata on Tuesday, the Election Commission has taken this action, expressing serious displeasure over the deteriorating state of law and order in the state
 unhone kaha, ‘yah sambhavat: pehla mauka jab ayog ko samvidhan ke anuchhed 324 ke tahat is tarah kii karrwai kerani padi ho
 Meanwhile, the commission has appointed Ajay Nayak, a retired IAS officer in the state as Special Observer and Retired Officer of Police Service Vivek Dubey as Special Police Observer
 iske alaava ayog ne ipies adhikari or pashchim bengal kii khufia shakha siaidi ke atirikt mahanideshak rajeev kumaar ko seva mukt kar kendriya grih mantralay bhej diya he
 The commission has also ordered West Bengal Home Secretary Atri Bhattacharya to be removed and handed over the charge to the Chief Secretary of the state

 He is the title of 12 times WWE Champion and 3 times World Heavyweight Champion

 gauratlab he ki smacdown ke logo kaa rang bhi nila he, isliye aisa mana ja rahaa he ki unhone kohli kii is tasviir se uskaa bhi prachaar kiya he
 Since smackdown's logo is blue, John Cena may have searched the internet with a bleed blue theme and found a photo of Kohli
 seenaa ne viraat vaali photo ke baad ek or tasviir post kii, usamen bhi 'blide blue’ likhaa hua he
 Take a second look, since this world-renowned wrestler has not written any message with Virat's picture, his doing so is being appreciated as Virat

 ) India has responded to Pakistan's hollow claims on a statement issued by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on the terror attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir
 videsh mantralay ne kaha he ki isse pehle 26 / 11 mumbai or pathankot hamalon main saboot dene ke baavjood pakistan ne koi karrwai nahin kii
 Despite all this, the ministers in 'naya Pakistan' publicly share the stage with Hafiz Saeed, the un-declared terrorist
 pulavama ke jimmedaar jaish or uskaa sargana masood ajahar pakistan main he or yah saboot karrwai karne ke liye kaaphi he
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravish Kumar said that Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan ignored jaish-e-mohammed's claim while denying any contact with the terrorists, in which the terrorist group claimed responsibility for the brutal incident
 yah ek gyaat tathy he ki jaish-e-mohammad or uske netaa masood ajahar pakistan main hai or yah saboot pakistan dwaara kadam uthaae jane ke liye paryaapt hona chahie
 Ravish Kumar said that the offer of investigation by the Prime Minister of Pakistan on providing evidence on behalf of India is an excuse
 26 / 11 mumbai hamale ke dauraan bhi paak ko saboot die jane ke baavjood 10 saal baad bhi is cese main koi pragati nahin hui
 Similarly, there was no progress in the Pathankot terror attack
 pakistan kaa trek dekhen to ection kii guarantee par record kaa vaada khokhla rahaa he
 In this 'new Pakistan', the minister publicly shares the stage with un-declared terrorist Hafiz Saeed
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa ne kaha ki pakistan ke pradhanmantri ne na to is nrushansa ghatana kii ninda kii or na hi shok santapt pariwaron ke prati samvednaa prakat karne ko munasib samajha
 It is regrettable that Imran Khan has described India's response to the Pulwama attack as inspired by the upcoming election, which India denies
 iske saath hi bharat maang karata he ki pakistan antarrashtriya samudaay ko gumraah karnaa band kare or pulavama hamale ke shadyantrkariyon ke khilaaf thos, spasht karrwai kare
 Ravish Kumar said that the Prime Minister of Pakistan has offered to talk on terrorism while offering talks
 bharat lagaataar is baat ko doharaata rahaa he ki aatank or hinsa rahit maahaul main ham har mudde par dwipaksheeya baatcheet ke liye taiyaar hai
 He said that Pakistan claims that it is the biggest victim of terrorism
 lekin yah tathy se pare he
 The international community is well aware of the fact that Pakistan is the center of terrorism
 gauratlab he ki pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne mangalvaar ko jari ek video sandesh main pulavama hamale main islamabad kaa haath hone se inkaar karte hue kaha tha ki karrwai yogya saboot milane par ve bharosa dilaate hai ki ection lenge
 Imran had also threatened India that if he attacks, Pakistan will have no other option but to answer it
 unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki yuddh shuru karnaa hamaare haath main hota he lekin yah khatm kab hoga yah allaah jaanata he
 On the Indian court Kulbhushan Jadhav, the international court order on Thursday said that this is the first step towards bringing justice to Jadhav
 saath hi bharat ne yah bhi doharaaya ki pakistan ne jadhav ke adhikaron or antarrashtriya niyamon kaa hanan kiya he or use bachaane kii puri koshish kii jaaegi
 He also clarified that the order of the International Court prohibiting the death sentence of former Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav is 'binding' on Pakistan
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa gopal baagle ne antarrashtriya adaalat ke faisle ke baad patrakaron se baatcheet main kaha ki videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne sansad ko aashwast kiya he ki sarkaar vah har sambhav prayaas karegi, jisase jadhav ko nyaay mili or unke jivan kii raksha kii ja sake
 In the tweet made today, the minister repeated the same thing
 baagle ne kaha ki aaj antarrashtriya court ne bharat ke anurodh par die gaye aadesh main pakistan ko nirdesh die hai ki vah aise saare kadam uthaae, joki is maamle main sambhav he
 Jadhav will not be executed until the death sentence pronounced by the Pakistani military court, until the final verdict of the court comes
 saath hi court ne pakisataan se kaha he ki vah bataae ki is aadesh ko lagu karne ke liye usne kya kadam uthaae hai
 He said, "we view this order with the same view that this is the first step towards correcting the violation of Jadhav's authority and international rules by Pakistan
" aashaa he ki pakistan is par amal kare
 India has breathed a sigh of relief from this court order
 hamen ummid he ki pakistan antarrashtriya adaalat ke aadesh kaa sammaan karegaa
 The comments jadhav ko counslar acces dene ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki vienna samjhaute ke anusaar bharat ne pehle hi isaki kai baar maang kii hui he or agar pakistan chahta he to vah kabhi bhi counslar acces de saktaa he

 Contrary to Congress General Secretary and Supervisor of Assam Digvijay Singh's assertion that there is no dissent in the Assam Congress, Gogoi even went on to say that an aide of his cabinet had joined hands with Ajmal against him
 or to or, hinsa main avaidh bangladeshiyon kii bhoomika par bhi gogoi congress ke bayanon se vipareet raay kaa izhaar karne se nahin chookte
 He also rejects the Congress stance on the role of illegal Bangladeshis in the BTAD violence
 10 july ko digvijay singh ne guwahati main kaha tha ki haal kii hinsa se avaidh bangladeshiyon kaa koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 On the same day, Gogoi said that more than 39,000 people of Assam identified by the tribunals as illegal intruders have fled
 gogoi kii yah sweekaarokti congress ke us sthapit rukh ke ekadam vipareet he jo lambey samay se is aabaadi ko apana sarvaadhik surakshit vot bank maanati rahi he
 In this way, Gogoi has explained very clearly where he is in the violence between Bodo and alleged illegal Bangladeshi
 gogoi 28 july ko jab pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke saath kokarajhaar ke raahat shiviron kaa daura kar rahe the, unhen gale main bodo scorf pahane dekha gaya
 During the last 11 years, Gogoi rarely wore a scarf, not even the traditional skull of Assam
 mukhyamantri ne to beatiedi chalaane vaali bodo kshetreey parishad (beatisi) ke netritv ke is daawey kaa bhi samarthan kar diya ki raahat shiviron main prabhavit ilaakon se baahar ke log hai
 Gogoi said, "we have told the BTC leadership that there is no place in BTAD areas for anyone living illegally
" beatiedi kshetron main keval vaastavik jameen maalik hi rahenge
 "gogoi's stance is one of the many U-turns he has taken since July 28 in BTAD areas
 mukhyamantri ne kaha tha, ''darasal, yah jameen ko lekar paraspar hiton kii ladaai he
 There are no Bangladeshi, only Indian citizens

 khabar milte hi kai khelpremiyon kaa ek hi prashn tha, siesake bhi khel rahi he na? khayr unhen to indian premier lig or indian super lig main fark samajhane main vakt lagegaa par footbal premi is khabar se bahut utsahit najar aa rahe hai
 After the end of the FIFA Football World Cup, the Indian football lover had fallen asleep in a sleepy foursome but suddenly the Indian Super League woke him up early
 hindustan main footbal premiyon ke rang-dhang hi alag hote hai
 Football lovers focus more on cheering their favorite team at the time of the match so that the rest can know which is their favorite team
 And often it is the same team that has been winning continuously for the last few seasons
 videshon main footbal kaa sijan chaahe jo hota ho hamaare yahaan footbal khilne kaa asal mausam tab banataa he jab nagar nigam kii chok ho chuki naaliyon ke ten bol jane se gali main pani bharna shuru ho
 At that time, Pelé and Maradona's soul penetrated inside every person playing football in a vest, a knee-clad vest
 apane lakshanon or visheshtaon ke chalate footbal premiyon ko vargeekrut bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Usually four types of football lovers are found here
 pehali kism main wo tamaam log jo footbal ko 'soker' kehete hai yaa kahana jaanate hai, bhale unhen ronaldo or ronaldinho main fark na pataa ho lekin itnaa jaanane bhar se footbal premi hone kaa larning license paaya ja saktaa he lekin jo log fasebuk par ‘ai lav mesi’ yaa ‘nemaar ij rockstar, ai lav dis game, whot a match’ apadet karte rahete hai wo pehali kism ke logon ko hey drushti se dekhte hai
 These are the second type of football lover
 inke footbal prem kii adhiktam seemaa yahaan tak hoti he ki bazaar main kahin bhi das number kii jersey dikh jaae to lapak ke kharid lete hai or uske baad pehali kism waalon ko yun dekhte hai jaise kanvent skool vaale bachche sarkari skool waalon ko dekhte hai
 The third type of football lover is those who give more emotion to clubs than countries
 kis club ne koun se saal main kis khilaadi ko kitne main kharida? yahi wo tapasvi log hote hai jo timezon main fark hone ke chalate raat ko teen-teen baje uthakar chelsia or barsilona ke match dekhte hai
 The fourth type of football lover is more dangerous than these three varieties
 inhen footbal itihaas kii ek-ek cheez yun rati hoti he maanon us match ke dauraan bich maidan par baithe rahe hon
 If you mention 'the Hand of the God' by mistake, then you will feel that you will get to know how the goal was achieved after 51 minutes of the match
 inase aap ye tak jaan sakenge ki gend ko hawa main kisi argentina ke khilaadi ne nahin balki england ke midfilder ne uchhaala tha
 After 1986, they will directly hear the 'battle of Santiago' between Chile and Italy in 1962 and if you show a little interest and you will also know that once between Kuwait and France between Kuwait and France
 Sheikh had to jump into the beach
 kai baar to lagata he bharat kahin na kahin footbal ke maidan main peeche isliye bhi rah gaya kyonki footbal pasand karne vaale use maidan par badhaava dene ke bajaay, soshal netwarking cites par ye dikhaane main lage rahete hai ki footbal ke bare main wo jaanate kitna hai

 gujarat main chunavi paara charam par he
 The rhetoric of the leaders is getting worse
 gujarat main vikaas rahul gandhi ke torget par he to modi or bijepi ke nishane par rahul or gandhi parivaar khud
 After commenting on Rahul Gandhi's temple visits, people associated with BJP continued to trend # rahul_nonhindu on social media on Wednesday
 darasal, yah hua isliye kyonki buudhvaar ko congress ke maujuuda upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi vishwaprasiddh somnath mandir main darshan karne gaye the
 Two types of registers are kept for entry of visitors to the temple
 pehla hindu aaagantukon ke liye jabaki doosraa register 'gaiyr-hindu' logon ke liye tha
 The Congress Media Coordinator made the entry of Rahul Gandhi's name in the register of 'non-hindu' people
 jiske baad turant hi register kii tasviir soshal media par viral ho gai
 The Congress fiercely retaliated, after the BJP commented on Rahul Gandhi's religion, the Congress also came into the fray and defended its leader
 congress ne press conference kar bataaya ki rahul gandhi kaa dharm hindu he
 Not only this, the Congress described Rahul as 'janeudhari Hindu'
 soshal media par bhi rahul ke paksh main kai post kiye gaye
 Many such pictures were shared in which Rahul Gandhi was seen wearing janeu
 congress ko jhatka lagane kaa daradrasal, congress ko yah isliye karnaa padaa kyonki gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main rahul gandhi ke netritv main congress ne soft hindutv kii ranneeti banaai thi
 Rahul has visited more than 20 temples so far, but a mistake in signing a non-hindu register has hit the Congress's soft Hindutva strategy
 to kya bharat ke liye 'hindu netaa' jaruri!agar rahul gandhi kaa hindu hona yaa gaiyr-hindu hona itnaa mahatvapurn he ki partiyaan anya mudde chhod isi mudde par bahes karen to kya duniya main yah sandesh nahin jayega ki bharat main netaa chune jane ke liye jaruri maanakon main sabase ahm uskaa 'hindu' hona he
 This would be a violation of the constitution of India
 It cannot be done on this issue that there is no talk of the constitution here
 samvidhan kii uddeshika main spasht likhaa he, "ham bharat ke log, bharat ko ek sampoorn prabhutv sampann, samaajawaadee, panthanirpeksh, loktantratmak ganraajya banane ke liye tathaa uske samast nagarikon ko
 
 
 "the preamble clearly mentions 'secular' ie secular
 
 
 to kya is mudde ko uthaakar bijepi samvidhan kii avhelnaa karti najar nahin aa rahi
 So does BJP want to win the election by defeating India? In this election too, the BJP wants to play the 'hindu card' by magnifying the issue
 bijepi kii pichhali kuch jeeton ke peeche kaa kaaran hindu voton kaa sangathit or ekatarfa hona hi rahaa he
 In such a situation, if the BJP wants to win the election on the issue of Hindutva over the issue of development, it will do so by 'beating India'
 kyonki bharat kii aatma 'sarvadharm sambhaav' main basati he
 Our Tehzeeb is Gangajamuni
 yahaan hindu or muslim, sikh, isai sabhi ek saath rahete hai
 Our belief is in 'vasudhaiva Kutumbakam'
 aakhir kyon shuru hua yah vivadadrasal, maujuuda gandhi parivaar ke saath yah vivaad tab se judaa hua he jab desh kii pehali mahila pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne swargeey firoz gandhi ko apana humsafar chunaa
 Despite the displeasure of Pandit Nehru, Indira married Feroze
 baad main sakriy raajnneeti main aane ke baad indira or firoz main dooriyaan badhati gayi
 It is said that the tomb of the late Feroze Gandhi is still located in Mumfordganj, Allahabad
 kalantar main rajeev gandhi ne bhi 'gaiyr hindu' sonia gandhi se shaadi kii
 Sonia is a Christian by religion
 yahi vajah he ki gandhi parivaar kaa asal dharm kya is par sanshay bana rahata he or bich-bich main aise vivaad saamne aate rahete hai
 Whereas Rahul Gandhi himself and his party have made it clear that they believe in Hinduism
 loksabhaa chunaav-2019 prachaar ke lihaaj se bhi dilachasp ho gaya he

 " Rohit Shetty has given back to back big hit films in Bollywood
 phir chaahe vah 'golmaal' siries ho, 'singhm' or singhm riterns' kii yaa 'chennai express' kii
 Rohit does not believe in the opinions of the critics about his films, but believes the decision of the audience
 acchhee baat he, lekin dukhad he ki is baar unhone apane in chaahane waalon ko bhi halke main le liya or khud ati aatmavishvaas par savaar najar aae
 After giving an entertaining film like 'chennai Express' with Shah Rukh, Rohit has brought childish films like 'dilwale'
 isse bhi dukhad yah he ki puri film main shahrukh khan said hero kii tarah najar aate hai
 This time Rohit Shetty has given this opportunity to Varun Dhawan instead of Shah Rukh Khan's brilliant entry
 nahin mila siti bajaane kaa maukagaur karne vaali baat yah he ki superstars kii entry kisi bhi film main bahut myne rakhti he, kyonki yahi vah mauka hota he jab cinema haul main unke chaahane vaale jamkar sitiyaan bajaate hai
 But this time Shah Rukh's fans did not get this chance
 vaise, sencible actor maane jane vaale shahrukh pichley kuch samay se filmon ko lekar apni kharaab pasand kii vajah se surkhiyon main rahe hai
 More than Varun's share Shahrukh has more chance, almost 40% of the entire script of 'dilwale' has been renamed to Varun Dhawan and 10% to the rest of the artists and cars
 shahrukh khan ke hisse baaki bachaa hua 50 fisadi samay aayaa, jisamen se 25 fisadi main ve sharif banane kii koshish karte najar aate hai or 25 fisadi main'kaali' banakar 'raaj' banane kii jugatakarte dikhte hai
 As a 'kali', they have fun and they are waiting, but Rohit Shetty knows what to think and tries to dominate 'raj' throughout the film on 'kali'
 shahrukh ko bhul gaye rohitphens par dukh kaa pahaad tab tutaa, jab vah ise shahrukh kii film samajhakar dekhne gaye the
 But it turned out to be Rohit Shetty's film, as all the stars in it were those who are often seen in his films
 phir itane dher saare actaron ko fansaane ke chakkar main vah shahrukh khan ko bhul jate hai or film ko bahut hi bachakaane dhang se deal karte hai
 In this way, a promising director like Rohit Shetty belittled the talent of an entertainment actor like Shah Rukh or, say, superstars like Shah Rukh superstituted Rohit
 kaajol main nahin bachaa karishma'dilavaale' kii darkaar fresh jodi thi
 Rohit chose Kajol for Shahrukh and Kajol no longer has that charisma
 shaayad rohit ne yah film dil se nahin box offis kamai ko hi dekhakar banaai thi or shaayad ve abhi tak isamen thode-bahut safal bhi rahe hai

 Why were the roads not built? Why is there a shortage of water? Why are there no jobs? Why are people being beaten and farmers are suffering? Such an idea is to confuse people and gain their votes
 iskaa sidhaa matlab he ki mukhyamantri ne khud hi haar maan lee he

 Till date, they have not done any work to eradicate poverty and when they ask them, they say, poverty is not to be eradicated

 Describing the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as a gang of fugitives and anti-punjab elements, Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal on Friday asked Punjabis to 'beware of their nefarious intentions'
 badal ne sikh gurudwara prabandhak samiti (esajipisi) ke purv adhyaksh gurcharan singh tohda ko unki barahavin punyatithi par unke gaanv main shradhanjali arpit karte hue ye baaten kahin
 Badal told the people of Punjab that Punjab should not get caught by the misleading propaganda being carried out by AAP
 unhone kaha, "aap kaa koi nishchit agenda nahin he
 Its only agenda is to fulfill its longing for power by ruling in any wrong way in Punjab
 " He called upon the Punjabis to give the Shiromani Akali dal-bharatiya Janata Party alliance another chance
 badal ne kaha ki 'aap' kaa anubhavheen or nausikhia netritv logon kii taraf madad kaa haath badhaane kii bajaae unhen duubo degaa
 This is proved by the Delhi model of his rule
 unhone kaha, "akali dal-bhaajapa gathbandhan vishwasaneey or aajamaaya hua brands he
 " congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue mukhyamantri ne kaha ki isane saamaajik, raajnneetik, aarthik yaa dharmik, sabhi muddon par punjab ke logon ko dhokhaa diya he
 He said that his party will not hesitate to make supreme sacrifice to save the water of Punjab, as it affects every section of the society
 tippaniyan Badal recalled his association with Tohra and said that he was not an individual but an institution

 badal ne punjab ke logon se kaha ki punjab ko 'aap' dwaara kiye ja rahe bhraamak prachaar ke jhaanse main nahin aana chahie
 He said, "AAP has no fixed agenda
 iskaa ekmaatr agenda punjab main kisi bhi galat-sahi tareeke se shashan kar satta kii apni laalasaa ko puri karnaa he
 " unhone punjabiyon se aahvaan kiya ki ve shiromani akali dal-bhartiya janata party gathbandhan ko ek mauka or den

 He said, "the Akali dal-bjp alliance is a reliable and tried-out brand
 " Taking a dig at the Congress, the Chief Minister said that it has betrayed the people of Punjab on all social, political, economic or religious issues

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke do bade afasaron samet paanch logon ko sibiai ne giraftaar kar liya he
 These include Rajendra Kumar, Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister and Tarun Sharma, Deputy Secretary
 sibiai ne rajendra kumaar ko 50 karod ke ghotaale kaa sargana bataaya he
 Rajendra Kumar is accused that he formed several front companies without giving tender government contracts, causing a loss of crores to the Delhi government
 is puure maamle kii shuruyaat pichley saal 15 disambar ko hui jab sibiai ne dilli sachivalay main mukhyamantri ke karyaalay par chapa daalaa tha or mukhyamantri ke pradhan sachiv rajendra kumaar se judi filein zabt kar lee thim
 After the raids, Arvind Kejriwal said that the CBI raided his office to find the file related to the DDCA
 kejariwal ne kaha tha ki us fil ke aadhaar par vitt mantri arun jetali funs rahe the
 But the CBI later accused Rajendra Kumar of corruption
 rajendra kumaar par apane pad ke durupyog or 2007 se 2014 ke bich ek company ko saadhe nau karod ke tender dilwane ke aaropon main cese darj hue
 According to the CBI, in 2006, Rajendra Kumar formed Endeavours Systems Private Ltd, a company to provide IT solutions and software to the Delhi government
 sibiai kaa aarope he ki rajendra kumaar ne dilli sarkaar ke soochna takanic se jude kaamon ke theke Endeavour Systems ko dilwaaye
 For this, the company was also included in the panel of several public sector units, so that it could get government work without tender
 dilli kii raajnneeti main kab koun si ghatana khabar he or koun si ghatana khabar kii aad main propeganda or khel, samajhnaa mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 Every other day in Delhi, some matter arises from both the sides and there is an uproar
 kabhi vidhayak giraftaar hota he, kabhi mantri ke kilaaf exiaar hoti he, kabhi raashtrapati vidhansabha ke paas kiye hue kanoon lautaa dete hai, kabhi 21 vidhayakon ko lekar offis of profit kaa maamla aa jaataa he, kabhi afasaron ke tabadale ko lekar aarope-pratyarope chalane lagate hai
 The news of the fight for rights and transfer of officers between the Lieutenant Governor and the Chief Minister has not yet ascertained how this government operates
 achaanak dilli ko koi shahar kehane lagata he koi nagarpalika kehane lagata he, koi kuch kehane lagata he
 Plenty of arguments are given from both sides, there are many attacks
 hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ke mutabik dilli hoicourt main is vakt das yachikaayen hai
 The Delhi government set up an inquiry commission headed by retired Justice SN Aggarwal to investigate the 2002 CNG fitness scam
 justise agarwal ne up rajyapal ko patr likhakar kaha he ki aapane apane offis ke ohade kii garima giraayi he yah kehete hue ki aap kendriya grahamantralay ke adeshon se bandhe hai
 According to this letter of Justice Agarwal, the Lieutenant Governor refused to cooperate with the Commission headed by him
 grahamantralay ne dilli sarkaar ke banaae ayog ko kanoonee rup se avaidh qaraar diya tha
 This type of confrontation has become common between Delhi, Center and Lt
 Governor
 dilli hai court main dilli or up rajyapal ke bich adhikaron kii spashtataa ko lekar bhi yachikaayen chal rahi hai
 On Friday, the Delhi government requested the Supreme Court for such clarity that the matter should be heard quickly
 somvaar ko sunwaayee honi thi magar justise je es khehar ne sunwaayee se khud ko alag kar liya
 The matter will now be referred to another bench
 dilli sarkaar chaahati he ki hoicourt kii jagah supreme court main sunwaayee ho kyonki vahaan ye maamla kai maheenon se lambit he jisase dilli sarkaar kaa kaamkaaj prabhavit ho rahaa he
 According to the constitution, when there is a dispute between the Center and the state, the Supreme Court has the power to settle it and not the Hoicourt
 is takaraav par anant bahes media main bhi ho chuki he
 Yogendra Yadav, the convenor of the Aam Aadmi Party's anti-swaraj campaign, has also said that it has been one and a half years in court
 kuch bhi nahin niklaa he
 One has to end it
 ummid he supreme court spasht faisla degaa jisase dilli kii janata ko sandesh jaae ki rashtriya rajdhani par kiskaa shashan chalata he
 At least this fight between the two must end
 pichley saal agast main dilli sarkaar ne krishi bhoomi kaa cirkil rate badha diya
 The Lieutenant Governor ordered the Delhi government to maintain status quo on it
 is faisle ke khilaaf do yachikaayen adaalat main daayar ho gayi
 The High Court then said that they would have to investigate whether the Lieutenant Governor needed to sign the notification issued in his name
 phir grahamantralay ne aadesh jari kar diya ki rajdhani main naukarshahon kii niyukti kaa adhikaar uske paas surakshit he
 News of the confrontation is coming in the day, the root of all this is waiting for that decision, what are the rights of the Lieutenant Governor in Delhi and what is the Government of Delhi
 kitabon main to likhit hai magar jab dedh saal se vivaad ho rahe hai to is par spashtataa zaruri he
 Not only this, there was a news of three laws passed by the Delhi Legislative Assembly to be sent from here
 zaahir he ki is bahes main jo jitegaa wo antim daleel hogi yaa jo samvidhan kii vyakhya hogi
 Who will make the final interpretation of the constitution
 pravaktaa yaa press conference se hoga yaa tivi ke ankar se hoga
 There is no reduction in attacks from both sides
 aam aadmi party kii taraf se kabhi pradhanmantri kii degree kaa masalaa uchhaala jaataa he to kabhi unke mantriyon kii degree ko lekar sawaal uthne lagate hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party argues that this is happening due to its increasing popularity in Punjab and Goa
 yah tark raajnneetik he
 Ever since the confrontation between the Center and Delhi started, there was no talk of elections in Punjab and Goa
 tathy yah he ki donon ke bich takaraav he
 What is the reason and what is the fear is a matter of reference
 arvind kejariwal punjab ke daure par hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party claims that it is going to get success there
 uski sabhaaon main bheed aa rahi he or koi survey hai jiske kaaran ve chunaav jeet se gaye hai
 The survey has also won in Goa
 bijepi kahati he ki chunaav hue to nahin to survey kii kya praasangikta
 BJP says that there are many cases against IAS officer Rajendra Kumar
 kejariwal bataayen ki wo ek bhrasht adhikari ko bachaane kaa prayaas kyon kar rahe hai
 There have been so many scams in Delhi that the time has come to say that the right Lokpal should be appointed for Delhi, about which everyone has forgotten
 lokapal hota to bhrashtachar ke in maamalon kii swatantra rup se jaachan kar rahaa hota
 When the Anti Corruption Bureau was to operate itself, why was so much of the country's time wasted and what is the recognition of the law with the Parliament
 tippaniyan On Monday, the Anti Corruption Bureau questioned Delhi Water Resources Minister Kapil Mishra
 asibi kaa kahana he ki mishra ne jaanch main sahyog nahin kiya
 Kapil Mishra says that ACB is trying to trap him
 kapil mishra bhi puure laav lashkar ke saath asibi pahunche jaise jantar mantar gaye hon
 The alleged tanker scam was investigated by Kapil Mishra last year
 400 karod ke kathith nuksaan ke liye shila dikshit sarkaar ko zimmedaar tehraaya tha
 But action was delayed after the investigation
 tanker company ko bhi nahin roka gaya
 The ACB wants to know why the investigation report was suppressed after it came
 kapil mishra kaa aarope he ki unase shila dikshit kii bhoomika ko lekar ek bhi sawaal nahin kiya gaya
 Mishra tweeted that six ACB officers are questioning him
 unka makasad mujhe or arvind kejariwal ko fansaana he
 All disputes are being settled on the road
 koun sahi he iskaa koi matlab nahin he
 It will be known when the matter reaches the court and only when the verdict comes
 dedh saal se yahi faisla aa rahaa he ki up rajyapal or dilli sarkaar ke adhikaar kya hai
 The fire is fierce between the two
 bijepi banaam aam aadmi party ke bich mukhya ladaai chalati he
 Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said on Monday that orders were received in the afternoon that 9 officers of the Delhi government have been transferred
 do din main gyaarah afasaron kaa tabadalaa kiya gaya he
 On May 18, the Delhi government also transferred 11 bureaucrats
 jisamen chah iees afasar hai or paanch adhikari dilli andaman nicobar island civil services ke adhikari hai
 The entire case began on December 15 last year when the CBI raided the Chief Minister's office at the Delhi Secretariat and seized files related to the Chief Minister's Principal Secretary Rajendra Kumar
 chhaapon ke baad arvind kejariwal ne kaha tha ki sibiai ne DDCA se judi file ko dhundne ke liye unke daphtar par chapa maaraa
 Kejriwal had said that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was getting trapped on the basis of that file
 lekin baad main sibiai ne rajendra kumaar par bhrashtachar kaa aarope lagaaya
 Rajendra Kumar has been booked on charges of misusing his office and getting a company worth Rs nine and a half crores from 2007 to 2014
 sibiai ke mutabik 2006 main rajendra kumaar ne dilli sarkaar ko IT solutions or software dene ke liye ek company Endeavours Systems Private Ltd banaai
 The CBI alleges that Rajendra Kumar got contracts for information technology related work of Delhi government to Endeavor Systems
 iske liye company ko kai public sector uniton ke panel main bhi shaamil kiya gaya, taaki use bina tender ke sarkari kaam mil sake
 Propaganda and sports under the garb of news is becoming difficult to understand when and which incident is news in Delhi's politics
 dilli main har duusare din donon pakshon kii taraf se koi na koi maamla uthta he or ghamaasan machataa he
 Sometimes the MLA is arrested, sometimes there is an FIR against the minister, sometimes the President returns the law passed by the Assembly, sometimes the Office of Profit comes to the case of 21 mlas, sometimes the charges of counter-transfers are going on
 Looks like
 up rajyapal or mukhyamantri ke bich adhikaron kii ladaai or adhikariyon ke tabadale kii khabaron se abhi tak yah sunishchit nahin hua he ki yah sarkaar kaise chalati he
 Suddenly Delhi starts calling it a city, someone starts saying municipality, somebody starts saying something
 donon pakshon kii taraf se khub tark diye jate hai, khub hamale hote hai
 According to our colleague Ashish Bhargava, there are currently ten petitions in the Delhi High Court
 dilli sarkaar ne 2002 ke sienji fitness ghotaale kii jaanch ke liye ritred justise es en agarwal kii adhyakshata main ek jaanch ayog banaaya
 Justice Aggarwal has written a letter to the Lieutenant Governor saying that you have reduced the dignity of your office position, saying that you are bound by the orders of the Union Home Ministry
 justise agarwal ke is patr ke anusaar up rajyapal ne unki adhyakshata main bane ayog ko sahyog karne se manaa kar diya
 The Ministry of Home Affairs had declared the Commission made by the Delhi Government legally illegal
 is tarah kii takaraav kii ghatana dilli, centre or up rajyapal ke bich aam ho gai he
 Petitions are also going on in the Delhi High Court between Delhi and the Lieutenant Governor regarding the clarity of rights
 shuukravaar ko dilli sarkaar ne aisi spashtataa ke liye supreme court se darkhwaast kii ki is maamle ko jaldi suna jaae
 The hearing was scheduled for Monday but Justice JS Khehar distanced himself from the hearing
 ab maamle ko duusari bench ke paas bheja jayega
 The Delhi government wants a hearing in the Supreme Court instead of the High Court as the matter has been pending there for several months, affecting the functioning of the Delhi government
 samvidhan ke mutabik jab centre or rajya ke bich vivaad hota he to uskaa nipataara karne kaa adhikaar supreme court ko he na ki hoicourt ko
 Infinite debate on this conflict has been held in the media
 aam aadmi party ke virdohi swaraj abhiyaan ke sanyojak yogendra yadav ne bhi kaha he ki dedh saal ho gaye is maamle ko adaalat main
 Nothing has come out
 kisi na kisi ko ise samaapt karnaa hi hoga
 It is expected that the Supreme Court will give a clear verdict which will send a message to the people of Delhi, who rules the national capital
 kam se kam donon ke bich is ladaai kaa ant hona hi chahie
 In August last year, the Delhi government increased the circle rate of agricultural land
 up rajyapal ne dilli sarkaar ko is par yathasthiti banaae rakhane kaa aadesh de diya
 Two petitions against this decision were filed in the court
 tab hoicourt ne kaha ki unhen is baat kii jaanch kerani hogi ki apane naam se jari notification par up rajyapal ko dastakhat karne kii zarurat he yaa nahin
 The Home Ministry then issued an order that it reserved the right to appoint bureaucrats in the capital
 aae din takaraav kii khabaren aa rahi hai in sab kii jad main us faisla kaa intazaar he ki dilli main up rajyapal ke adhikaar kya hai or dilli sarkaar ke kya
 It is written in books, but when there are controversies for one and a half years, then it is important to have clarity on it
 yahi nahin dilli vidhansabha ke paas kiye gaye teen kanoonon ke bhi raashtrapati ke yahaan se bhej diye jane kii khabar ai thi
 It is clear that what will win in this debate will be the final argument or the interpretation of the Constitution
 samvidhan kii antim vyakhya koun karegaa

 On behalf of the Aam Aadmi Party, sometimes the issue of the Prime Minister's degree is raised, sometimes questions arise regarding the degree of his ministers

 This argument is political

 This decision has been coming for a year and a half, what are the rights of the Lieutenant Governor and Delhi Government
 ghamaasan bhayankar he donon ke bich
 The main battle goes on between BJP vs Aam Aadmi Party
 up mukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne somvaar ko kaha ki dopaher main aadesh mila ki dilli sarkaar ke 9 afasaron kaa tabadalaa kar diya gaya he
 Eleven officers have been transferred in two days
 18 may ko dilli sarkaar ne bhi 11 naukarshahon ke tabadale kiye the
 There are six IAS officers and five officers are officers of Delhi Andaman Nicobar Island Civil Services
 sibiai kaa aarope he ki rajendra kumaar ne dilli sarkaar ke soochna takanic se jude kaamon ke theke Endeavour Systems ko dilwaaye
 For this, the company was also included in the panel of several public sector units, so that it could get government work without tender
 dilli kii raajnneeti main kab koun si ghatana khabar he or koun si ghatana khabar kii aad main propeganda or khel, samajhnaa mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 Every other day in Delhi, some matter arises from both the sides and there is an uproar
 kabhi vidhayak giraftaar hota he, kabhi mantri ke kilaaf exiaar hoti he, kabhi raashtrapati vidhansabha ke paas kiye hue kanoon lautaa dete hai, kabhi 21 vidhayakon ko lekar offis of profit kaa maamla aa jaataa he, kabhi afasaron ke tabadale ko lekar aarope-pratyarope chalane lagate hai
 The news of the fight for rights and transfer of officers between the Lieutenant Governor and the Chief Minister has not yet ascertained how this government operates
 achaanak dilli ko koi shahar kehane lagata he koi nagarpalika kehane lagata he, koi kuch kehane lagata he
 Plenty of arguments are given from both sides, there are many attacks
 hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ke mutabik dilli hoicourt main is vakt das yachikaayen hai
 The Delhi government set up an inquiry commission headed by retired Justice SN Aggarwal to investigate the 2002 CNG fitness scam
 justise agarwal ne up rajyapal ko patr likhakar kaha he ki aapane apane offis ke ohade kii garima giraayi he yah kehete hue ki aap kendriya grahamantralay ke adeshon se bandhe hai
 According to this letter of Justice Agarwal, the Lieutenant Governor refused to cooperate with the Commission headed by him
 grahamantralay ne dilli sarkaar ke banaae ayog ko kanoonee rup se avaidh qaraar diya tha
 This type of confrontation has become common between Delhi, Center and Lt
 Governor
 dilli hai court main dilli or up rajyapal ke bich adhikaron kii spashtataa ko lekar bhi yachikaayen chal rahi hai
 On Friday, the Delhi government requested the Supreme Court for such clarity that the matter should be heard quickly
 somvaar ko sunwaayee honi thi magar justise je es khehar ne sunwaayee se khud ko alag kar liya
 The matter will now be referred to another bench
 dilli sarkaar chaahati he ki hoicourt kii jagah supreme court main sunwaayee ho kyonki vahaan ye maamla kai maheenon se lambit he jisase dilli sarkaar kaa kaamkaaj prabhavit ho rahaa he
 According to the constitution, when there is a dispute between the Center and the state, the Supreme Court has the power to settle it and not the Hoicourt
 is takaraav par anant bahes media main bhi ho chuki he
 Yogendra Yadav, the convenor of the Aam Aadmi Party's anti-swaraj campaign, has also said that it has been one and a half years in court
 kuch bhi nahin niklaa he
 One has to end it
 ummid he supreme court spasht faisla degaa jisase dilli kii janata ko sandesh jaae ki rashtriya rajdhani par kiskaa shashan chalata he
 At least this fight between the two must end
 pichley saal agast main dilli sarkaar ne krishi bhoomi kaa cirkil rate badha diya
 The Lieutenant Governor ordered the Delhi government to maintain status quo on it
 is faisle ke khilaaf do yachikaayen adaalat main daayar ho gayi
 The High Court then said that they would have to investigate whether the Lieutenant Governor needed to sign the notification issued in his name
 phir grahamantralay ne aadesh jari kar diya ki rajdhani main naukarshahon kii niyukti kaa adhikaar uske paas surakshit he
 News of the confrontation is coming in the day, the root of all this is waiting for that decision, what are the rights of the Lieutenant Governor in Delhi and what is the Government of Delhi
 kitabon main to likhit hai magar jab dedh saal se vivaad ho rahe hai to is par spashtataa zaruri he
 Not only this, there was a news of three laws passed by the Delhi Legislative Assembly to be sent from here
 zaahir he ki is bahes main jo jitegaa wo antim daleel hogi yaa jo samvidhan kii vyakhya hogi
 Who will make the final interpretation of the constitution
 pravaktaa yaa press conference se hoga yaa tivi ke ankar se hoga
 There is no reduction in attacks from both sides
 aam aadmi party kii taraf se kabhi pradhanmantri kii degree kaa masalaa uchhaala jaataa he to kabhi unke mantriyon kii degree ko lekar sawaal uthne lagate hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party argues that this is happening due to its increasing popularity in Punjab and Goa
 yah tark raajnneetik he
 Ever since the confrontation between the Center and Delhi started, there was no talk of elections in Punjab and Goa
 tathy yah he ki donon ke bich takaraav he
 What is the reason and what is the fear is a matter of reference
 arvind kejariwal punjab ke daure par hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party claims that it is going to get success there
 uski sabhaaon main bheed aa rahi he or koi survey hai jiske kaaran ve chunaav jeet se gaye hai
 The survey has also won in Goa
 bijepi kahati he ki chunaav hue to nahin to survey kii kya praasangikta
 BJP says that there are many cases against IAS officer Rajendra Kumar
 kejariwal bataayen ki wo ek bhrasht adhikari ko bachaane kaa prayaas kyon kar rahe hai
 There have been so many scams in Delhi that the time has come to say that the right Lokpal should be appointed for Delhi, about which everyone has forgotten
 lokapal hota to bhrashtachar ke in maamalon kii swatantra rup se jaachan kar rahaa hota
 When the Anti Corruption Bureau was to operate itself, why was so much of the country's time wasted and what is the recognition of the law with the Parliament
 tippaniyan On Monday, the Anti Corruption Bureau questioned Delhi Water Resources Minister Kapil Mishra
 asibi kaa kahana he ki mishra ne jaanch main sahyog nahin kiya
 Kapil Mishra says that ACB is trying to trap him
 kapil mishra bhi puure laav lashkar ke saath asibi pahunche jaise jantar mantar gaye hon
 The alleged tanker scam was investigated by Kapil Mishra last year
 400 karod ke kathith nuksaan ke liye shila dikshit sarkaar ko zimmedaar tehraaya tha
 But action was delayed after the investigation
 tanker company ko bhi nahin roka gaya
 The ACB wants to know why the investigation report was suppressed after it came
 kapil mishra kaa aarope he ki unase shila dikshit kii bhoomika ko lekar ek bhi sawaal nahin kiya gaya
 Mishra tweeted that six ACB officers are questioning him
 unka makasad mujhe or arvind kejariwal ko fansaana he
 All disputes are being settled on the road
 koun sahi he iskaa koi matlab nahin he
 It will be known when the matter reaches the court and only when the verdict comes
 dedh saal se yahi faisla aa rahaa he ki up rajyapal or dilli sarkaar ke adhikaar kya hai
 The fire is fierce between the two
 bijepi banaam aam aadmi party ke bich mukhya ladaai chalati he
 Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said on Monday that orders were received in the afternoon that 9 officers of the Delhi government have been transferred
 do din main gyaarah afasaron kaa tabadalaa kiya gaya he
 On May 18, the Delhi government also transferred 11 bureaucrats
 jisamen chah iees afasar hai or paanch adhikari dilli andaman nicobar island civil services ke adhikari hai
 Propaganda and sports under the garb of news is becoming difficult to understand when and which incident is news in Delhi's politics
 dilli main har duusare din donon pakshon kii taraf se koi na koi maamla uthta he or ghamaasan machataa he
 Sometimes the MLA is arrested, sometimes there is an FIR against the minister, sometimes the President returns the law passed by the Assembly, sometimes the Office of Profit comes to the case of 21 mlas, sometimes the charges of counter-transfers are going on
 Looks like
 up rajyapal or mukhyamantri ke bich adhikaron kii ladaai or adhikariyon ke tabadale kii khabaron se abhi tak yah sunishchit nahin hua he ki yah sarkaar kaise chalati he
 Suddenly Delhi starts calling it a city, someone starts saying municipality, somebody starts saying something
 donon pakshon kii taraf se khub tark diye jate hai, khub hamale hote hai
 According to our colleague Ashish Bhargava, there are currently ten petitions in the Delhi High Court
 dilli sarkaar ne 2002 ke sienji fitness ghotaale kii jaanch ke liye ritred justise es en agarwal kii adhyakshata main ek jaanch ayog banaaya
 Justice Aggarwal has written a letter to the Lieutenant Governor saying that you have reduced the dignity of your office position, saying that you are bound by the orders of the Union Home Ministry
 justise agarwal ke is patr ke anusaar up rajyapal ne unki adhyakshata main bane ayog ko sahyog karne se manaa kar diya
 The Ministry of Home Affairs had declared the Commission made by the Delhi Government legally illegal
 is tarah kii takaraav kii ghatana dilli, centre or up rajyapal ke bich aam ho gai he
 Petitions are also going on in the Delhi High Court between Delhi and the Lieutenant Governor regarding the clarity of rights
 shuukravaar ko dilli sarkaar ne aisi spashtataa ke liye supreme court se darkhwaast kii ki is maamle ko jaldi suna jaae
 The hearing was scheduled for Monday but Justice JS Khehar distanced himself from the hearing
 ab maamle ko duusari bench ke paas bheja jayega
 The Delhi government wants a hearing in the Supreme Court instead of the High Court as the matter has been pending there for several months, affecting the functioning of the Delhi government
 samvidhan ke mutabik jab centre or rajya ke bich vivaad hota he to uskaa nipataara karne kaa adhikaar supreme court ko he na ki hoicourt ko
 Infinite debate on this conflict has been held in the media
 aam aadmi party ke virdohi swaraj abhiyaan ke sanyojak yogendra yadav ne bhi kaha he ki dedh saal ho gaye is maamle ko adaalat main
 Nothing has come out
 kisi na kisi ko ise samaapt karnaa hi hoga
 It is expected that the Supreme Court will give a clear verdict which will send a message to the people of Delhi, who rules the national capital
 kam se kam donon ke bich is ladaai kaa ant hona hi chahie
 In August last year, the Delhi government increased the circle rate of agricultural land
 up rajyapal ne dilli sarkaar ko is par yathasthiti banaae rakhane kaa aadesh de diya
 Two petitions against this decision were filed in the court
 tab hoicourt ne kaha ki unhen is baat kii jaanch kerani hogi ki apane naam se jari notification par up rajyapal ko dastakhat karne kii zarurat he yaa nahin
 The Home Ministry then issued an order that it reserved the right to appoint bureaucrats in the capital
 aae din takaraav kii khabaren aa rahi hai in sab kii jad main us faisla kaa intazaar he ki dilli main up rajyapal ke adhikaar kya hai or dilli sarkaar ke kya
 It is written in books, but when there are controversies for one and a half years, then it is important to have clarity on it
 yahi nahin dilli vidhansabha ke paas kiye gaye teen kanoonon ke bhi raashtrapati ke yahaan se bhej diye jane kii khabar ai thi
 It is clear that what will win in this debate will be the final argument or the interpretation of the Constitution
