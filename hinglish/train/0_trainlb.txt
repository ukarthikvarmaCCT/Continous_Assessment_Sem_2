 The story of the never ending Bhopal gas tragedy has taken another new twist
 bhopal shahar or puraa desh is traasadee ke mukhya aaropee jis warren anderson ko bharat waapas bulaane ke liye pichley 28 saal se sangharsh kar rahaa tha, uske prati bharat ke kendriya grih mantri pi
 Chidambaram has shown empathy
 unki baton se saaf jaahir tha ki sarkaar anderson ko waapas bulaane kii icchhuk nahin he
 However, the reason for this was stated differently
 chidambaram ne union carbide ke siio anderson ko waapas na bulaane ke peeche mukhya kaaran unki vridghavastha or beemaari ko bataaya
 He said in Bhopal last week, "anderson is now almost 90 years old
 ve budhaape or kamajori ke saath-saath or kai samasyaon se jujh rahe hai
 Given these conditions, it is to be seen what can be done to bring them back
 ''ve bhopal gas traasadee par gathit kendriya mantriyon ke samooh kaa netritv kar rahe hai
 He was accompanied by Law Minister Salman Khurshid and Union Minister of State for Personnel Narayan Sami
 yah samooh supreme court ke us aadesh ke baad gathit kiya gaya he, jisamen duniya kii sabase khatarnaak gas traasadee ke 28 saal baad bhi union carbide factory ke ware house main maujuud 350 metric ton kachare ko surakshit dhang se thikaane na lagane ke liye centre ko fatkaar lagaai gai he
 The Supreme Court said, "even after 28 years, the decision could not be taken because the people affected by the problem are poor
" yah samasya se nibatane main sarkaar kii naakaami he
 After the gas accident, 20,000 metric tonnes of waste was dumped below ground in two ponds and 17 other places, due to which people are still drinking contaminated water in the area of three km
 bhopal gas traasadee main 3,800 log maare gaye the or lagbhag 10,000 log ghayal hue
 Anderson was arrested at that time and was released on bail on December 7, 1984, just four days after the incident of leaking of that poisonous gas
 usee din madhya pradesh sarkaar ke vimaan se ve bhopal se nikal kar america ravaanaa ho gaye or uske baad kabhi kisi mukademe main pesh hone ke liye bharat nahin aae
 In 1993, the District Court found Anderson guilty of a criminal case
 uske baad 2001 main sibiai ne dilli court main anderson par phir se mukadmaa chalaae jane ke liye chargeshit daakhil kii
 The CBI said that Anderson was aware of the weak safety measures at the plant and has new strong evidence in this regard
 anderson ko is sambandh main aagaah bhi kiya gaya tha
 The night of 2-3 December 1984 was the result of negligence on security
 lekin centre ke dhulmul ravaie, anderson ko bharat bulaane kii anichhaa or laaparvaahee ne 28 saal se nyaay kii aas lagaae gas peediton kii ummiido ko kuchal diya he
 "from the very first day, the government is soft towards Dow Chemicals and now is showing softness towards Anderson on the pretext of old age and illness," says Bhopal Gas Victim Women's Industry Organization convenor Abdul Jabbar

 ) After the bitter cold in Delhi turned lukewarm on Monday and the weather remained pleasant, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and her daughter Priyanka Gandhi Vadra reached the Khan Market in the morning to enjoy the weather
 priyanka apni maa sonia gandhi ke saath subah 11 baje ke kareeb khan market pahunchin or restaurant main khaane kaa jaayaka liya
 People shopping around here gathered to see them
 koi unase baatcheet karne laga, to koi unke sang selfi lene laga
 Wearing a popular hooded sweat shirt and jeans usually seen in saris
 unke haath main shopping bag bhi tha
 Sonia was wearing a shawl
 dilli ke mausam kii hi tarah congress kii siyasat bhi pichley dinon thandi hi padi hui thi
 In the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, when the Congress, which was in the grip of the Grand Alliance, tried to overthrow the Congress on the occasion of football enthusiast Akhilesh's political bets of his wrestler father, Priyanka took the front from the Gandhi family
 unhone akhilesh yani tipu ko ehsaas kara diya ki vah bhale hi sapa ke sultan ban gaye hon, lekin upi kaa sultan banane ke liye cycle tabhi daudegi, jab haath kaa jor cycle ko chalaaegaa
 Eventually, the matter was sealed and a political settlement was reached between the sp-congress, after which Khan reached the market for an outing with Sonia; is par likhaa tha, 'never Underestimate a Woman'
 
 
 These words were a clear expression of Priyanka's confidence
 darasal congress chaah rahi thi ki bihar kii tarj par upi main bhi bijepi ko rokane ke liye mahagathbandhan banaaya jaae
 In Bihar, this political equation was very successful, but in UP, there were obstacles in its path
 yahaan tak ki cycle par sawari kaa khwab dekh rahi congress ko akhilesh ne thenga dikhaa diya tha
 All the well-known players of the Congress also became concerned with this bet of Akhilesh
 tab priyanka ne kaman sanbhali or morcha apane haath main liya or siyaasi thand jhel rahi congress ko sapa se gathbandhan kaa lihaaf dilwane main kaamyaab raheen
 Perhaps this is the reason that as soon as the party got the warmth of this thought, Priyanka and Sonia went out to enjoy the warmth of the weather in Delhi
 ab congress ko mili yah siyaasi dhoop kitni garmaahat de paaegi, iske liye to nateezon kaa intazaar karnaa hoga
 Currently, for the marginalized Congress party in UP, the new Sultan of the Samajwadi Party, born in the name of anti-congress, has the support of Akhilesh Yadav

 yahi vajah he ki aaj research or deveopment kii field main naukari ke maukon ke nechar or sankhya donon main ahm badlaav hue hai
 Research and development are the backbone of every existing technology, so we need to constantly make new changes and be optimistic to get better and more intuitive solutions

 This is also necessary due to the country's growing population and lack of energy
 isliye research or deveopment main lo power electronics dizin or haai speed parformens vaali ejineering kaa ubhaar ho rahaa he
 Similarly, mobile phones are now not just a means of connectivity but have also become a source of information and business resources
 research ab in saare functions ko haath main rakhe ja sakane vaale is chote-se divaais main daalane ke raste talash rahe hai
 Apart from this, areas such as chip systems, verification technology, flash storage medium, software research and hardware and software design are also being developed

 Two features are necessary for entry and success in the field of research and development
 pehla yah ki aapkaa fundamental puri tarah spasht ho
 It is a very challenging field in which many aspects are constantly changing over time
 raftaar barkaraar rakhane ke liye researchrs ke paas behtareen nolej honi chahie, khaskar basics ke maamle main
 Therefore, it is very important for you to develop your fundamental during school-college days
 isse lambii daud main phayda milegaa
 The second thing is that you have to always be ready to learn new things because as a researcher you cannot turn a blind eye to adopting new skills or information
 balki aadhuniktam trends se lagaataar apadet rahanaa bahut jaruri he
 There are opportunities to gain experience at the workplace but it should be remembered that the process of learning does not end with graduation
 research or deveopment ke kshetra main kadi mehnat or patibaddhta kii jarurat to he lekin vastav main yah ek romaanchak sector he
 Especially in the fields of IT and technology
 aaj adhik-se-adhik log nai technology apana rahe hai, isliye aane vaale varshon main bhi is sector kaa ullekhneey vikaas or vistaar hoga

 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) today retaliated on Rahul Gandhi's statement in which he said that Mahatma Gandhi was martyred due to the Sangh ideology
 sangh ne kaha ki congress ko dusron ko upadesh nahin dena chahie, kyonki khud uski hi soch aisi he jo rashtrapita mahatma gandhi evam sardaar patel kii vichaardhaara ke khilaaf he

 Taking a dig at Rahul Gandhi, Madhav said that the Sangh usually does not respond to childish comments but Congress leaders should read history properly
 sangh pravaktaa ne kaha ki kendriya grih mantri rahete hue patel ne janvari 1948 main mahatma gandhi kii hatya ke baad sangh par pratibandh jarur lagaaya tha, par yah kehete hue aath maheene ke bheetar pratibandh hataa bhi liya tha ki sangh kaa us ghatana se koi lenaa-dena nahin tha
 The spokesperson also asked the Congress a question, are they ready to make the ideology of Sardar Patel the ideology of the Congress? Targeting the Congress, Madhav claimed that Jawaharlal Nehru had told Sardar Patel at a Cabinet meeting that he was a communal person and that he could not work with him

 'unhone kaha ki vah is aapattijanak bayaan ko lekar kal 22 aktubar ko bhopal kii ek adaalat main rahul ke khilaaf manahani kaa daawa daayar karenge

 Calling Rahul a 'festival boy' of politics, Jha sarcastically said, "rahul comes and walks away saying hello-hi to the public
" unki reliyon se congress kaa koi phayda hone vaala nahin he, kyonki janata behad samajhadaar he
 However, when the BJP vice-president was questioned on the increasing cases of rape of women in the state, he termed them as 'social incidents' and said that it is not right to blame any party's government for increasing such incidents

 During the discussion, Rajiv Khandelwal, co-founder and executive director of the Livelihood Bureau, said that farmers are marginalized in this country
 unki samasyaon par kisi kaa dhyaan nahin jaataa he
 He said that the problem of burning straw is a matter of the village, it does not get much attention
 rajeev khandelwal ne kaha ki vaayu pradooshan ko hamane market ke hawaale kar diya he, jaise ki varkar ko sefti mask lenaa he to khud karegaa, agar use safai kerani he to wo khud karegaa
 Industry management has no role in this
 unhone kaha ki iske liye ve industry or work place ko jimmedaar maanate hai
 Rajiv Khandelwal said that hundreds of people are dying from the disease named silicosis in the field in which they work
 rajeev khandelwal ne kaha ki ye beemaari silica dhul se hoti he
 Stating the figures, he said that 270 people have died in 11 panchayats in 3 years due to this disease

 On the problem of burning the straw, he said that research is done where the urban problem is connected, but the problem of the straw is connected to the village
 is vajah se is sector main shodh nahin ho paata he
 If there was research into it, there would have been some result

 ) If the opinion polls are to be believed then the possibility of a third front seems to be raising its head
 kayaas lagaae jane lage hai ki 2014 main tisare morche ko centre kii gaddi mil sakati he
 If this happens, the non-congress, non-bjp alliance will come to power for the third time in the history of the country
 bahut se logon kaa maananaa he ki teesraa morcha khyaali pilav he, jo jameen se zyada kshetreey dalon ke dimag main uchhal-kud machaa rahaa he
 But many leaders of regional parties believe that "now is the time
" ’’ bijepi ise sire se khaarij karti he
 Arun Jaitley, Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha, says, "history is a witness that the Third Front is a failed experiment
 ’’ phir bhi samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke mulaayam singh yadav jaise netaaon ko pakkaa bharosa he ki unka samay aa gaya he
 "the next government will form regional parties," he says
 ’’tisare morche ko khaarij karne ke peeche bijepi kii apni vajah he, uski najar main yah morcha ‘‘vot baantne’’ kaa kaam karegaa
 The real strength of the BJP lies in northern and western India
 andhra pradesh, tamilnadu, karnataka or kerala jaise rajyon se loksabhaa main kareeb 150 saansad aate hai, lekin inamen bijepi kii upasthiti ansh maatr he
 In Odisha, West Bengal and Northeast too, its status is negligible
 in rajyon main uttar pradesh or bihar ko bhi jod len to tisare morche ke sambhavit ghatak dalon sapa, tiemasi, bijedy, eiediemke, tidipi or viesar congress ko adhiktar siten milane kii ummid he
 It is evident that the key to the next government is regional leaders like Jayalalithaa, Mamata Banerjee, Naveen Patnaik, Chandrababu Naidu or Jaganmohan Reddy, Lalu Yadav or Nitish Kumar, Mulayam Singh Yadav or Mayawati and to some extent Prakash Karat and A
 ve
 It is in Vardhan's hand
 unke liye adarsh sthiti yahi hogi ki congress or bijepi donon se zyada siten jeeten
 Then seek external support from either of them
 philhal is par sahmati nahin he ki teesraa morcha donon main se kis rashtriya dal kaa daaman thamega
 The SP, RJD, JD (U), YSR Congress and TMC have to hold Muslim vote banks in their respective states, so the BJP is less likely to hold on
 agar bijepi ke netaa modi hue to muslim vot khisakane kaa dar rahegaa
 Leaders like Jayalalithaa and Naveen Patnaik have no such fear
 lalu-nitishah gathbandhan ko bekararaise halaat main lalu prasad congress ke bahari samarthan se tisare morche kii sarkaar yaa congress ke netritv main sarkaar ko pasand karenge
 According to rjd's political managers, the situation in Bihar will be better than the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, given the changed political equations
 us samay unhen sirf chaar siten mili thim
 This reduced Lalu's political influence at the center
 lalu yah yaad dilaate hue nahin thakte ki unhone or unki party ne kabhi bijepi kaa haathaa nahin thama
 He says, "our record is a witness that we never connected with communal forces (ie BJP)
" ’’philhal lalu kii praathamikta yahi he ki congress kisi bhi haalat main jedy (you) kaa saath na le
 He fears that if the Congress hands over Nitish, the pan will go in favor of the JD (U) -congress alliance
 or ise badi sankhya main muslim vot milenge
 Lalu says, "I have always stood with Soniaji
 argedy akeli party he, jisane kabhi bijepi kaa saath nahin diya or chaahe jo ho jaae, kabhi degi bhi nahin
 On the other hand, Nitish has almost exhausted his options by taking a decision to break the 17-year-old alliance with the BJP
 unke rajnatik prabandhak maanate hai ki nikat bhavishya main jedy (you) ke liye sabase acha saathi congress hi ho sakati he
 There are many reasons for this
 ek to nitish ko bihar ke liye vishesh darja paane kii khatir congress kii jarurat he
 Secondly, they also want the party to support them so that Muslim votes get to their alliance instead of Lalu
 pichley do chunaav main bihar main agadi jatiyon ke adhiktar vot jedy (you)- bijepi gathbandhan ko mili hai
 But the forward castes, angered by the decision to break with the BJP, may not vote for Nitish this time
 jedy (you) congress ko rijhaane kii har koshish kar rahaa he
 He has saved the Congress several times on delicate occasions in Parliament
 khaadya suraksha, beemaa or bhoomi adhigrahan jaise vidheyakon par virodh bhi choda he
 JD (U) political manager Sanjay Jha says, "we can support UPA in 2014 provided Bihar gets special state status
" ’’bijepi ke sambhavit pradhanmantri pad ke pratyaashee narendra modi ke prati nitish kii virakti kisi se chhipi nahin he
 Rajya Sabha member of JD (U)

" har maheene kareeb ek baar samarthan waapas lene kii phufakaar ke baavjood ve sambandhon ko tuutane ke kagaar tak nahin jane dete
 They know that if the Third Front is to form a government at the Center, then Congress or BJP will have to take support
 uttar pradesh main muslim vot kii ahmiyat ko samajhate hue mulaayam kam-se-kam khule aam to bijepi kaa naam bhi nahin le sakate

 Where is the question of joining BJP or supporting Modi under Modi's leadership
 ’’mayawati bhi, apane dhur virdohi mulaayam kii tarah pradhanmantri kii kursi ke khwab dekhati hai

 a senior party leader said that there is no question of alliances with any political party before the election

 "their election managers also believe like SP that if BSP wins Lok Sabha seats around 35, Mayawati will be a very strong contender for the post of Prime Minister
 chaar baar upi kii mukhyamantri rah chukin mayawati ne 2002 main gujarat dangon ke baad vidhansabha chunaav main modi ke liye prachaar kiya tha
 Analysts believe that the BSP and the AIADMK are the two parties outside the NDA that, under Modi's leadership, can overcome the bjp's lead in forming a government at the Center

 Karat has closed his path saying that his party will not support the Congress even in the name of keeping the BJP out of power in 2014
 pashchim bengal main nikat bhavishya main unki vaapasi kii ummid na ke baraabar he, karaat ko sirf kerala kaa aasraa he
 As expected, if the party performs well there, it is possible that the CPM may register a good presence in Parliament

 The only formal announcement remains that Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has decided not to contest the upcoming assembly elections from Ganderbal seat
 yadi ve yah kadam uthaate hai to kashmir main sabase majboot aadhaar vaale is ilaake par 37 varshon se abdulla parivaar ke raajnneetik varchasv kaa ant ho jayega
 The late Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah, the grandfather of Omar Abdullah and the guardian of the National Conference, contested his first election in 1977 from Ganderbal after returning to mainstream politics
 1975 main indira-abdulla samjhaute ke baad ve mukhyadhara kii raajnneeti main aae
 It was through this agreement that Sheikh's running of 24 years from New Delhi and Nehru family was over
 rajya ke pradhanmantri siem pad se shaikh kii asammanjanak vidaai or uske baad 1953 main unki giraftaar ke baad yah duuri paidaa hui thi
 After Sheikh, Umar's father and former Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah contested and won the 1983, 1987 and 1996 assembly elections from Ganderbal
 umr ne apana vidhansabha chunaav 2002 main ganderbal se ladaa tha, lekin pidipi ke kaaji mohammad afjal ke haathon parrast hue the
 He later defeated Qazi in 2008 and became the Chief Minister of the state in 2009
 party ke ek varisht netaa ne apana naam jaahir nahin hone dene ke aagrah par bataaya ki umr abdulla ne saaf taur par kah diya he ki ve ganderbal se chunaav nahin ladenge
 Omar has accused the activists of tarnishing the party's image in Ganderbal, but there is widespread dissatisfaction among the locals
 uttar pradesh main congress kii siaayan jameen ko taiyaar karne ke liye loksabhaa chunaav main party mahasachiv or purvanchal kii prabharee prinyaka gandhi ne edi se chotii kaa jor laga diya tha, lekin chunaav nateezon se congress ko tagada jhatka laga he
 Since the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, the churning and meeting of the party has continued
 is kadi main priyanka gandhi mangalvaar ko do divasiy daure par raibareli pahunch rahi hai or yahaan party kii haar kii samiksha baithak karengi
 With this, Priyanka will also prepare a road map to make the Congress stand again in the state
 priyanka gandhi 11 or 12 june ko raibareli main purvi upi ke jila adhyaksh, shahar adhyaksh or loksabhaa chunaav main lagaae gaye koordinator ke saath samiksha baithak karengi
 It is believed that in this meeting, along with reviewing the reasons for the defeat, Priyanka will also discuss the reorganization of the party in the state
 priyanka gandhi mangalvaar ko dilli se shaam saadhe saat baje raibareli ke fursatganj airport pahonchegi
 After this, the seats will be dotted at the Bhumau guesthouse
 subah saadhe nau baje se shaam paanch baje tak purvi uttar pradesh ke sanghathan ke saath meeting karengi
 Will return to Delhi at 9 pm
 bataa den ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne loksabhaa chunaav se pehle upi ko do bhaagon purv or pashchim main baantkar priyanka gandhi or jyotiraditya sindhiya ko isaki jimmedaari di thi
 In the result of the Lok Sabha elections on May 23, the Congress has been completely wiped out in the state
 congress ke bade netaaon ke saath-saath congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi khud amethi se chunaav haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa he
 The interesting thing is that in the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress has lost the percentage of votes along with the seat in Uttar Pradesh
 2014 ke chunaav main congress ko do seat ke saath saadhe saat fisadi vot mili the, par is baar party ko sirf 6
 Got 3 percent of the vote
 haalanki 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko 6
 2 percent votes were received
 jab congress sapa ke saath gathbandhan kar chunavi maidan main utari thi
 The Congress is making strides towards preparing for the renewal of the organization for the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh
 party kii koshish he ki vidhansabha chunaav se pehle puure pradesh main booth str se lekar adhyaksh tak badlaav kiya jaae taaki, party kaaryakartaaon main bharosa paidaa kiya ja sake
 However, Priyanka Gandhi had earlier held a meeting with all the secretaries and leaders of the Congress of UP and talked about making the organization fresh
 priyanka ne kaha tha ki ab uttar pradesh main nae jila adhyaksh or block adhyaksh banaae jaaenge
 For which good candidates will be searched
 uttar pradesh main sanghathan ko majboot banane or nae logon ko apane saath jodne kii ranneeti kaa khaakaa taiyaar kar kiya ja rahaa he
 In this regard, senior party leaders are discussing separately with the leaders of the state Congress
 mana ja rahaa he ki priyanka raibareli kii baithak se vidhansabha chunaav kii taiyaariyon kii aupchaarik shuruyaat kar sakati hai

 The 'fault' of the woman is that she has given birth to a piece of her liver in Jaisalmer
 darasal, bachche kaa janm or vatan vaapasi kii kavayad niyamon main ulajh gai he
 The Jaisalmer-born child is no longer allowed to go to Pakistan with his mother, as the 10-day-old child has neither a visa nor a passport
 jabaki pakistani danpati ke bharat main janma yah baccha niyamanusaar pakistani hi kehalaayegaa
 The couple's child, who left the Thar Express on Friday night, was stopped and returned to Munabav on Saturday
 munaabaav main tainaat abjan adhikariyon ke mutabik, niyamon ke aadhaar par danpati ko 10 din ke bachche ko bharat main chhodkar pakistan janaa hoga
 The Pakistani couple arrived in Jodhpur on Sunday and then the Pakistani embassy officials left for New Delhi for the child's visa-passport
 kya or kaise ulajhaa he maamlajaisalmer ke basanpir nivasee raseed khan ne bataaya ki unki najdiki rishte main dohiti marai fatima (35) apane pati mir mohammad lahar jo pakistan ke ghotki ke rahane vaale hai, 22 farvari ko munaabaav maarg se jaisalmer ai thi
 She came to visit her mother when her father died
 haalanki unka vija sirf dedh maah kaa hi tha lekin baad main use ekstand karavaaya gaya tha
 Actually Fatima was pregnant when she came to India
 14 april ko usne jaisalmer ke ek nijee aspataal main bete ko janm diya
 In the records of the hospital, a berth certificate in the name of Sohail Khan, son Mohammad and Fatima was also issued by the local city council
 danpati parivaar shuukravaar ko thar express se pakistan ke liye ravaanaa hue, lekin shanivaar ko unhen navjaat ke saath pakistan jane se roak diya gaya
 Abortion officials posted there told them that the child does not have any type of visa passport, so they cannot take him to Pakistan
 ab kya ho saktaa he ageniemon ke mutabik ab yadi danpati ko pakistan janaa hai to unhen bachche ko yahi chhodana hoga, kyonki bachche ke paas vija yaa passport nahin he
 But the problem is that whom should the couple leave the newborn of 10 days in India
 rashid khan ne bataaya ki fatima jab bharat ai thi tab vah 7 maheene kii garbhvatee thi
 On the other hand, official sources of the city council have confirmed the issuance of a birth certificate in the couple's India-born child Sohail Khan

 maharashtra kii siyasat main mere hisaab se is baat par koi bahes bhi nahin ho sakati ki 1995 ke baad bhartiya janata party ne 2014 ke chunaav main aitihaasik nattejey die hai
 But due to lack of absolute majority, these results are now questioning BJP
 pehle aakhri samay par naatakeey tareeke se shivasena se rishte todna or phir bager shivasena se samjhauta tay hue apana mukhyamantri bananaa or uddhav thakare main asamanjas paidaa karnaa
 Will the Shiv Sena finally come with the BJP or is it a problem of the Army and the BJP? lekin isse kahin zyada badi samasya he ki maharashtra jaise rajya kaa kya hoga? haal ke saalon main maharashtra kaa karz 2 lakh 70 hazaar karod se zyada kaa ho gaya he
 In such a situation, the important question is that while running a government of a minority, what tough decisions will Devendra Fadnavis be able to take and will Fadnavis not succumb to different pressures? bhale hi unki chhavi eemaandaar netaa kii bataai ja rahi he, lekin yah maharashtra kii sabase badi chunauti he
 Speechfiction and rhetoric are all well in place, but Maharashtra has a long history of system corruption
 to kya ek alpamat kaa mukhyamantri is itihaas ko badal paaegaa or agar apni sharton ke saath shivasena or bijepi main koi samjhauta hota he to kya bijepi apana vajood aage badha paaegi? Politically, it is clear that whether it is Shiv Sena or any other party, it would not like to give any opportunity to BJP to increase its strength in Maharashtra and this is the only agenda of BJP, because both its thinking and dream was that in Maharashtra Bagher came with someone his government, leaving him one step behind

 Something like this is the story of Delhi's band Menhupose
 menhoopoj kai vajahon se khaas he
 One, it has been around for 18 years
 vah 2000 kaa saal tha jab band ke bhavi bas player randeep singh ne dilli haat main band ke ek pradarshan ke dauraan usase sampark kiya
 The band then had lead singer Sarabjit Chadha Riria, a veteran of the car radiator empire, who had become a father
 jis shahar ke bare main ve geet gaate hai, usee kii tarah yah band bhi jaise-taise bache hue logon kii khep he
 Menopause has seen life very closely among these people: Bipolar disorder, alcohol addiction, cancer and Parkinson's
 band ke kai sadasyon ne apni alag raahen chun leen lekin menhoopoj kaa vrihad project kabhi thama nahin
 There is shrinking space for alternative rock music in Delhi
 lekin band ne isse khud ko hatotsahit nahin hone diya he
 After all, India is a huge country, so Menhupuz has transformed this geography of the country into his wealth
 pichley maheene jab india today ne phone par unase baat kii thi to ve arunachal pradesh ke jangalon main kai bhatak rahe the
 They were looking for a place called Saijosa, where they had tied up to perform
 yah bhi kya mjedaar vidambnaa he
 a Delhi band produces an album about Delhi and then takes his music to the far northeast by speaking to hell to shake the mainstream of Delhi
 2017 main aae album nion dilli main unka mukhya kirdaar dilli he
 It contains references to everything from the "bloody" redline buses to the 1984 Sikh massacre that had passed with the country's capital
 pramukh gitarist anup kutti kehete he, ''yah shor ke bare main bhi he
 Whenever you come to Delhi, you hear the sound of a drilling machine
 isse aap batch nahin sakate
 It keeps piercing your mind
 kutti or randeep in saare badlaavon se waakif hai
 He ran a successful restaurant and bar in Hauz Khas village called The Toddy Shop which had for some time become an artist's hub in Delhi
 ''rajdhani ke jyadatiyon ke cantope" ke bare main unke khyaal unke video single ''on da boat" main dekha ja saktaa he jise preet vihaar ke hindi raper phadu ne gaya he
 The single was a mix of hindi-english
 is mujeec video main band ke maujuuda manager sahaj bhaatia hai jinhone sikhon ke khilaaf dange bhadakaane ke maamalon main ek abhiyukt congressi netaa par pani kaa gilaas oochhaalane ke liye ek raat jail main guzari thi
 Neon Delhi is a slow-paced album - artistic, experimental and peculiar
 mana jaataa he ki achche album dhime dhime aap par apana rang chadhaate hai
 For the first time, when you start feeling very loud, you should be a little suspicious about it
 jab is band ne apane in nae gaanon ko dilli ke hard rock cafe main ek shrotaaon ke hujum ke saamne pesh kiya to uskaa asar aisa tha maano koi band baaki sabase beparwaah apane hi vaadyon ke saath chhedchhad kar rahaa ho
 But the first effect can also be misleading
 nion dilli ek headphone album he or uskaa har gaanaa behad kaarigari ke saath gadha gaya he
 Like a multi-layered jigsaw puzzle that keeps on solving with great care
 'me bi hu noj' kaa jo shuruaati dhamak vaala tukdaa he, uske tale aapako modi va kejariwal kii awaajen bhi sunai dengi

 The Supreme Court on Thursday termed this demand of a Hindu institution as having a problem that after about 500 years, it should be judged judicially whether the Mughal ruler Babur had dedicated the disputed structure in Ayodhya to 'allah' so that It could become a legitimate mosque under Islam
 'akhil bhartiya shri ram janm bhoomi punaruddhar samitat ke vakil ne pradhan nyaayadhish ranjan gogoi kii adhyakshata vaali paanch nyaayadhishon kii samvidhan peeth se kaha ki elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ne yah kahkar galati kii ki vah is maamle main nahin jayega ki kya babar ne bina 'sharia' 'haddees' or anya islamic paramparaon kaa paalan kiye bina masjid kaa nirmaan karaayaa
 In the case filed by a Muslim side, senior advocate PN Mishra, on behalf of the Wadi Hindu organization, said that Babur was not the owner of the land and was unable to legitimately 'waqf' to build the mosque, on these allegations
 Instead of deciding, the High Court had said that as nearly 500 years passed, it would not look into the issue which could be the subject of 'debate for historians'
 mishra ne raajnneetik rup se samvedansheel ramajnmabhumi-babari masjid bhoomi vivaad main 15wein din kii sunwaayee ke dauraan peeth se kaha, "islam main babar jaisaa nirankush shaasha bhi sabakuch nahin kar saktaa tha
 He also had to follow religion
 "peeth ne kaha, "ucch nyaayalay ne kaha tha ki babar ko svachhand adhikaar the or usne kuch kiya tha jisaki samiksha nahin kii ja sakati
 The High Court had said that we cannot see the question that what Babur had done was against 'sharia'
 " peeth ne kaha ki islamic kanoonon or paramparaon ke kathith ulanghan kii baat karne ke bajaay ucch nyaayalay ne kaha ki vah is pahalu ko dekhegi ki log ise masjid maanate hai
 The bench also has Justice SA Bobde, Justice DY Chandrachud, Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice SA Nazir
 peeth ne kaha, "agar ham babar dwaara masjid ke taur par jameen ke istemaal kii nyaayik vaidhata ke bare main poochhate hai to yah thodi samasya vaali baat he

 (input language) kendriya mantri giriraaj singh ne kaha ki patna main jalajmav ke liye janata nahin rajg jimmedaar hai, or ham janata se kshamaa yachana karenge
 Speaking to reporters in Begusarai on Wednesday, Giriraj said, "I am a representative of Begusarai
 If nothing happens here, we will accept the deficiencies and apologize to the public
" rajg kaa hissaa hone ke saath patna main bhi bhaajapa ke kai saansad hai or vahaan kii janata ne hampar bharosa kiya
 We are not responsible for the flood that is known to the public
 ham (rajg) janata se kshamaa yachana karenge
 My pain is with the people living in the Patna metropolis, whose entire belongings (in the waterway) have been destroyed
 ham pani nikasi ko lekar satark nahin ho paae
 If we had become conscious, we would not have to see this day today
 ''giriraaj ne mangalvaar ko kaha tha ki patna ke kharaab haalat kii ekmaatr vajah kuvyavastha he prakritik aapadaa nahin
 Meanwhile, West Champaran MP and bjp's newly appointed Bihar unit president Sanjay Jaiswal said that "what has happened in Patna is a case of administrative failure
" rajya sarkaar ko sthiti kii samiksha kerani chahie, javabdehi tay kerani chahie or anukaraniya karrwai kerani chahie
 '' kundali main grahon kii aisi sthiti jisase jivan main kam prayaas main hi badi safalataa milen, rajyog kehalaati he
 At the same time, despite the efforts due to the position of the planets in the horoscope, when such a failure is found, such a state is called Duryoga
 duryogon ke kaaran vyakti ko asafalataa uthaani padati he tathaa sthayitv main samasya aati he
 But if there is strong Raja Yoga in the horoscope, the misuse of the horoscope is destroyed by a single Raja Yoga or auspicious yoga
 shani karm or uske fal ko niyantrit karata he isliye maanav jivan main shani kii bhoomika mahatvapurn ho jaati he
 Since Saturn is dominated by giving fruit, its Raja Yoga and Duryoga are most effective
 shani se banane vaale duryog koun se hai or unka prabhaav kya he?- shani kaa kundali ke bhautik sukh dene vaale bhav main baithna ek prakaar kaa duryog he jo samasya paidaa karata he
 - Saturn found in the lower zodiac also causes a big problem
 - shani kaa rahu yaa mangal se sambandh hone par durghatana kaa prachand duryog banataa he
 - When Saturn is related to Sun, snake yoga is formed which is a fatal misuse for father and son
 - shani kaa vrishchik raashi yaa chandramaa se sambandh hone par vish yoga hota he jo vyakti ko vairaygy or asafalataaon kii ore le jaataa he
 It also shows the way of drinking tea, coffee, water, auspicious yoga or Raja Yoga formed by nature and predictions and their effect? - Saturn makes a person very powerful if he is situated in the third, sixth or eleventh house of the horoscope
 - shani agar ucch raashi yaa mul trikon raashi main ho to "shash" naamak panchmahapurush yoga banataa he
 - Even if Saturn is in Jupiter's zodiac, a person earns immense fame
 - shani brihaspati or shukr ke sanyog se "anshavatar" naamak yoga banataa he, jo vyakti ko divine bana detaa he
 No major spiritual yoga is effective without the grace of Saturn
 5 din shukr par rahu-shani kii chaaya se pareshaan rahengi mahilaayein, karen upaayshani ke rajayogon ko majboot karne ke or duryogon ko nasht karne ke saral or achook upaay- har shanivaar ko yaa to ek vela upwas rakhen yaa satvik aahaar grahan karen
 - Put water in the Peepal tree in the evening, light a mustard oil lamp and revolve around the tree
 - tatpashchaat shani ke tantric mantra kaa kam se kam 108 baar jaap karen
 Donate food and clothes to a poor person
 - halke nile rang ke vastron kaa prayog karen

 After this, RLD got support from the entire opposition including SP, BSP, Congress in Kairana, then BJP had to face defeat here too

 a media report of its party leaders allegedly having links with corporate lobbyist Neera Radia and soon after the Congress attacks on it, the BJP strongly defended its leaders and said that neither LK Advani has associated with this woman Neither did the trust attend the program nor did party president Nitin Gadkari know it
 bhaajapa ne party mahasachiv anant kumaar se us media sanghathan ke khilaaf kanoonee karrwai karne ko kaha he jisane apni khabar main unke radia ke saath ‘ghanishtha vyapaarik’ rishte hone or videshi bainkon main unka dhan jamaa hone ke aarope lagaaye hai

 jetali ne kaha ki is media sanghathan ne aniatik patrakarita kii he jis par tikhi pratikriya or karrwai karne kii jarurat he
 In this news, charges have been made on the basis of the talk of a person who has recently been released from jail, who has a personal dispute with the woman (neera Radia) and who is close to a Congress leader
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa netaaon ke khilaaf aarope lagaate hue is media sanghathan ne mul tathyon ko bhi nahin parkhaa
 Therefore, we have asked party general secretary Anant Kumar to take legal action against this media organization immediately

 The party has also been accused that senior leader Advani had participated in a program of a trust in Vasant Kunj in 2002 involving the woman
 unhone kaha ki hakeekat yah he ki adwani ne tab pejawar swami ke trust ke shilanyas samaaroh main bhaag liya tha or swami khud yah kah chuke hai ki adwani par lage aarope tathyaatmak rup se galat hai
 Swamy's trust was allotted land to the United Front government and the bjp-led NDA government had nothing to do with this land allocation

 jamiya uniwarsity ilaake main mache bavaal ke baad police ne jo exiaar darj kii he, usamen sthaneey netaaon ke alaava jamiya ke chaatr netaaon ke naam bhi shaamil hai

 On the third day of the protest i
e
 the evening of 15 December, when a large number of protesters moved ahead of the university and went ahead of Julana, the situation became uncontrollable
 bason ko aag ke hawaale kar diya gaya, jamkar patharbaji hui, lathicharge bhi kiya gaya
 Police took action in this case and arrested 10 people, who have been sent to jail
 jabaki jamiyanagar police stesan main darj kii gai FIR main saat logon ke naam kaa khulaasa kiya gaya he
 Explain that this FIR has been lodged by Jamia Nagar Police Station SHO Upendra Singh
 purv vidhayak or congress netaa kaa bhi namis FIR main jin logon ko namjad kiya gaya he, unamem okhla vidhansabha seat ke purv vidhayak or congress netaa asif mohammad khan kaa naam bhi shaamil he

 saath hi yah bhi kaha gaya ki ye netaa logon ko bhadkaa rahe the or chaatro ke bich gum-ghumkar narebaaji kar rahe the
 The FIR stated that all these leaders shouted slogans opposing the NRC and CAB and proceeded towards Mathura Road and the mob took turns ravaging vehicles
 exiaar ke mutabik, halaat kaa kaabo karne ke liye aansu gas ke gole chode gaye
 The MLA had risen on Amanatullah
 After this violent demonstration, the local MLA and AAP leader Amanatullah Khan were directly accused by the Bharatiya Janata Party
 ye bhi aarope lagaae gaye ki amanatullah khan ne bheed ko uksaaya or uskaa netritv kiya
 Many outsiders have also given complaints against Amanatullah
 haalanki, amanatullah ne apni safai dete hue kaha tha ki jahaan hinsa hui, us pradarshan se unka koi vaasta nahin he, wo vahaan se kaaphi dur kalindi kunj ke paas yojit virodh pradarshan kaa hissaa the
 Apart from Amanatullah, the Aam Aadmi Party has also given similar explanations
 AAP ke rajyasabha saansad sanjay singh ne amanatullah khan kii maujuudagi par kaha he ki 'koi pramaan nahin he ki hinsa main amanatullah khan kaa haath ho
 Despite this, if you want to put Amanatullah Khan in jail, then it is a panic for the BJP to lose the Delhi Assembly elections
 'aam aadmi party bhale hi amanatullah ke bahaane bijepi ko gher rahi he, lekin philhal jamiya nagar thane main jo exiaar hinsa ke sambandh main hui usamen amanatullah kaa koi zikr nahin he
 Rather, former Congress MLA Asif Mohammad Khan and the rest are local leaders

 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 This is published directly from Syndicate Feed) (NDTV team has not edited this news
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Politics has intensified on Yashwant Sinha's statement about the economy
 bijepi main hi abhinayta se netaa bane shatrughna sinha ne sinha ke bayaan ko sahi tehraaya tha ab yashavanth sinha ke bachaav main bijepi se suspend kiye gaye saansad kirti aaazaad bhi utar aae hai
 In a special conversation with 'aaj Tak' from Kirti Azad, he said that the writing of Sinha was very serious
 unhone kaha ki agle din vitt mantri arun jetali ne sawaalon kaa jawaab dene kii bajaay sinha par vyaktigat akshep lagaae, jisaki apeksha nahin thi
 Kirti Azad said that if there is a slowdown in the economy and any such allegations are made, then in such a situation you expect that the finance minister of the country will respond seriously
 lekin vitt mantri ne kaha ki sinha 80 saal kii umr main naukari dhund rahaa hai, unase jo chijen poochi gayi uskaa jawaab nahin diya or baat ko mudde se bhatka diya
 Questioning the economy and Jaitley, Azad said that in the history you have gone, leave history, 40 months have passed, there has been an outcry among the people
 unhone kaha ki ham bhi apane kshetron main jate hai to log sawaal poochhate hai, baar-baar jiesti or notebandi ke bare main sawaal poochhate hai
 Kirti said that we want at least the people to come and explain to the Finance Minister
 samajha-bujhaakar logon ko bataaen ki agar kathor kadam uthaae gaye hai to kis prakaar se thik hoga yaa unki samasyaayein khatm hongi
 Quoting Chanakya, Azad said that when a bumblebee sits on a flower, it sucks the juice in such a way that the flower does not know
 usee prakaar se agar aap tex bhi lagaate hai to kam se kam aam logon ko uskaa dard nahin hona chahie
 Suppose we are against
 ham mauka paakar hamale kar rahe hai
 But remove the agony of the situation which is for the businessmen and the common man
 unhone kaha ki maan lo ki ham baagi hai, maan lo yashavanth sinha baagi hai, maan lo baaki log jo virodh main bolte hai baagi hai
 But does positive criticism also have to be rebellious? Karti Azad said that what a positive criticism a man cannot do, is he rebelled if he sees the circumstances first? yah cheez aaj tak mujhe samaj main nahin ai
 There is democracy and if someone speaks in democracy then how did he become a rebel
 yashavanth sinha ji ke saath kya hua nahin hua mujhe usase koi lenaa dena nahin he
 My question is only that the article he wrote should have been given point-by-point answer which was not given
 cricketer se netaa bane kirti ne kaha ki jawaab naa dene se mere man main jo shankaa thi vah vishwaas main badal gai ki sach main arthvyavastha bahut kharaab he
 Otherwise, the answer given by Arun Jaitley, who found the job the next day, was made fun of by Sinha's article
 unhone kaha ki yashavanth sinha bhi ek achche arthshaastri rahe hai, vitt mantri rahe hai or unke jawaab main jab is prakaar se bol dena thik nahin he
 Taking a dig at Jaitley, Azad said that if he never wins the Lok Sabha elections, then it can be understood that Jaitley cannot understand the pain of the common people
 yah main samaj saktaa hum or unako is baat kaa phayda detaa hum ki aap nahin samaj paaenge kyonki aapane kabhi chunaav nahin jeeta or aam aadmi ke bich baithne kaa mauka unhen nahin mila
 In Mumbai, Kirti also targeted Raj Thackeray on the statement of outsiders
 unhone kaha ki raaj thakare to khud bihar kaa he yadi aap kitaab padhe hai bala sahab thakare kii to unhone apni kitaab main likhaa he ki mere jo purvaj bihar se hi aae the
 What he abuses should be killed first and then think of someone else
 wo naukaron ko garm press se jalaati thi, chammach se daant tod detii thi, nakli baransinghe ke sir se buree tarah peethti thi, dandon se beintahaa pitayee karti thi
 This story of humiliation is related to the wife of up's BSP MP Dhananjay Singh, who has been sensationalized for the murder of her maid
 jagriti ne khud police ke saamne apane gunahon ko kabool kiya he
 The strong heart will also tremble after hearing the confession that has come out after the arrest of mp's wife Jagriti Singh
 dilli police ke mutabik hatya ke iljaam main giraftaar jagriti singh ne police ko bataaya ki vah kaise ghar ke naukaron par julm dhaati thi
 Jagriti has revealed that she often tortured household servants
 3 november ko usne naukaraani raakhi ko buree tarah se peeta or use khaanaa tak nahin diya tha
 The maid could not bear the vigorous beating from the legs on her chest and she succumbed
 police ke saamne jagriti ne khulaasa kiya he ki jab se 2012 main wo vidhansabha kaa chunaav haari thi, tabhi se depressant main rahati thi
 Her relationship with her husband was also not good and that is why she used to persecute her house servant
 police ke mutabik jagriti ko lagata tha ki naukar uski baat nahin sunate or uskaa majaak banaate the
 Jagriti told that she had also seen a servant and maid Rakhi once in an objectionable condition, after which the persecution of both had increased
 police ke mutabik jagriti ne mana he ki vah naukar or naukaraani donon ko buree tarah se peethti thi, naukaraani ke munh main chammach daalkar uske daant tod detii thi, naukaraani raakhi ke bal bhi jagriti singh kaat detii thi, naukar ko jagriti singh garam press se jalaati thi, naukaron ko wo nakli barasingha ke sing se bhi maarthi thi, naukaron par najar rakhane ke liye ghar main 20 CCTV camere laga rakhe the, bathrum tak main jagriti ne sisisiti camera laga rakhaa tha
 Police say that MP Dhananjay Singh also knew how his wife was treating the servants, but he also tried to hide the matter from the police
 itnaa hi nahin saansad ne ghar main lage sisitivi kii footage ko bhi delit karne kii koshish kii, lekin kaamyaab nahin ho sake
 The police has arrested the MP on charges of erasing evidence
 dilli police ke mutabik pichley ek hafte se jagriti ghar main kaam karne vaale 3 naukaron ko buree tarah se peet rahi thi
 On Diwali evening, he beat his minor servant and maid Rakhi badly
 unke seene par pair rakhkar jagriti ne unhen peeta, jisase naukaraani ke haath kii haddi tut gai, or uske sharir par gahare jakhm ho gaye the
 Jagriti also badly injured the servant
 police ke mutabik 4 november kii subah saadhe 4 baje tak naukar ne raakhi ko jinda dekha tha, lekin uske baad raakhi kii maut ho gai
 Both the husband and wife are currently under police custody and are being questioned by the police
 sabhaara anuj mishra, chiraag gothi, shivendra shrivastav or vishaal pratap singh The idea of being away from mobiles, which has become an important part of life, makes us sad, but according to a study, one evening a week, separation can increase your happiness and can also improve your performance
 adhyayan ke liye harvard bijness skool ne boston kansalting group (bisiji) ke 1400 karmchaariyon par pareekshan kiya
 Researchers instructed those personnel to keep the smart phone off once a week after 6 pm
 pro
 The study was conducted for three years under the leadership of Leslie Pelray
 shuru main bisiji ke prabandhak is adhyayan ko lekar chintit the or unka kahana tha ki agar isse karmchaariyon ke pradarshan par jaraa bhi fark padaa to ve ise roak denge
 The Daily Mail reported that those whose phones were off were found to be more satisfied with their jobs
 unhone bataaya ki unke kaam or jivan main zyada santulan aayaa or unki kaary kshamta badhi
 Bomb in place of books in baggage
 qamar main belt ke saath barood

 baaki bachche skool jane ke liye taiyaar ho rahe the or wo donon bacchiyaan jananath ke safar kii taiyaari kar rahi thim
 His parents had explained to him how he would get paradise
 8-9 saal kii umr ke bacchon tak ko bhi bagdadi nahin baksh rahaa he
 In the name of Jihad and Jannat, he is giving them a bag full of gunpowder so that these children can save their lives by giving them their lives
 kehete hai ki kisi kaa mustaqbil tabah karnaa ho to uskaa aaj syah kar do
 These girls are still in Baghdadi today and also in Baghdadi tomorrow
 yani mustaqbil bhi
 Through this one picture, Baghdadi is showing us the darkest moment of today and also tomorrow
 donon maasoom jo abhi fazaishton kii umr kii hai, is vakt us taiyaari main juty hai jise sun kar puri duniya laraz jaaegi
 These girls are getting ready at the moment, but not to go to school nor to go out to play with their friends
 ab donon apane maa-baap se vidaa hongi
 Because of all the hugs
 maa-baap inhen pyaar bhi karenge
 But after this farewell, these parents may not cry but your eyes will cry
 in maasoom ko unke apane hi maa-baap ne ye bataaya or sikhaaya he ki is ghar se baahar nikalate hi wo sidhe jananath main jaaengi
 The paradise whose dream is given to him by Baghdadi
 ye to maasoom hai
 They do not even understand the world of Jannat, but what to do
 maasoom hai to maa-baap par yakeen he
 Good or bad is not known
 maa-baap achche hote hai ye inhen etbaar he
 This mother has prepared him for Jihad by showing him the dream of the birth of Baghdadi
 yani in donon maasoom ko jananath bhejne kaa edia is maa kaa hi he
 but why? Why is a parent intent on sacrificing her flower-like girls for Baghdadi? The father of these innocent people asked the same question to his wife, so read what his wife and mother of these innocent answers? This answer may make you restless, but read it
 
 
 aatanki-tum apni bacchiyon ko marane ke liye kyon bhejnaa chaahati ho
 She is just 7 and 8 years old
 kam se kam jihad ke liye to ye bahut choti hai
 No one is too small or big for the girl child's jihad
 ye to har musalmaan kaa farz he
 Terrorist - You are right
 allaah tumhen salaamat rakhe or tumhaari betiyon kii is qurbaani ko kubul kare
 Well now let them go to join this battle of God
 bacchiyon se aatanki-kya tum un kafiron ke saamne ghutane tekna chaahogi jo tumhaara rape karen or maar den yaa phir tum unhen maarna chaahogi
 We belong to a magnificent religion that does not succumb to the persecution of enemies
 bacchiyaan-haanaatanki-tumhen ghabaraane kii koi zarurat nahin, kyonki tum donon jananath ja rahi he
 Girls - Allahu Akbar: Both the girls have been dressed in bombs
 in donon ke badan par barood bandhe hai
 That is, these are human bombs
 pataa nahin jis bam ko ye bacchiyaan apane badan par baandhakar dhamaakaa karne ja rahi hai
 After this, whether this mother will get their pieces or not, but call it awesome, Baghdadika, who is playing such a game in the name of Islam with the mind of these people that despite having eyes, they have become blind
 inhen itani samaj nahin ki jehad or jahaalat main kya fark he

 — taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh)may 19, 2018 The arrival of Virender Sehwag may have raised hopes for India's return but former England captain Ian Batham feels that since Sehwag has not been able to get the match practice, the hosts could win the series 4–0
 batham ne ‘daily mirar’ ne apane kalam main likhaa, ‘mujhe koi kaaran nahin dikhataa ki england 4-0 se kyon nahin jeet saktaa
 Who can stop him from doing so
 bharat kaa maujuuda ballebaaji kram to katai nahin
 He said, 'virender Sehwag is playing the third match and Gautam Gambhir has also become fit

 Sehwag will start the innings without any match practice and that too against the current England attack
 yah utana aasaan nahin he
 Batham said that Indian batting looked weak except for Rahul Dravid
 unhone kaha, ‘sirf rahul dravid ne kuch jujharupan or takanic dikhaai he jo itane saal tak kaamyaab rahane ke liye jaruri he
 i do not doubt the ability of players like VVS Laxman and Sachin Tendulkar, but they have just shown a glimpse of what they can do
 ’batham ne kaha ki england ko usee team ko barkaraar rakhana chaiye jisane doosraa test 319 ran se jeeta tha
 He said, 'england should come down with the same 11 players who defeated the best Test team in the world
 ’unhone kaha, ‘tim bresanan, stuart broad, ian bel or mat praayar ek baar phir team ko jeet dilaa sakate hai
 With this, you will get the crown of number one, which is eagerly awaited
 ’ batham ne kaha ki kris tremelet ke feet hone par bhi tej gendbaaj bresanan ko antim ekadash main shaamil kiya janaa chaiye

 The only goal of the talented youth is to play in this rich T20 league
 khilaadiyon or westeindies cricket board ke bich purv main vivaad jagajaahir he
 Hooper believes that the IPL has increased the team's woes in the long-term format
 westeindies kii taraf se 102 test match khilne vaale hupar do test maichon kii siries main camentry karne ke liye 16 saal baad bharat aae hai
 He said, 'we should be aware of this (the impact of IPL on West Indies cricket)
 tii-20 cricket bana rahanaa chahie
 Hooper said, "you're getting more leagues today than you did five years ago
" isse ham prabhavit ho rahe hai, kyonki westeindies ke adhiktar yuva khilaadiyon kaa lakshya kisi ipel team se anubandh karnaa hota he
 Hopper, who runs several restaurants in his new home in Adelaide, said, "this affects his availability in West Indies cricket and includes Test cricket
" ’bhugtan vivaad or vishvabhar ke tii-20 lig main khilne ke vikalp ke kaaran kris gail, dwen braavo, kirone pollard or sunil naren jaise khilaadi chote praroopon main khilne ko praathamikta de rahe hai
 "the IPL is only for six weeks, but our position is that bowlers like Sunil Narine who took six wickets in their last Test match (in 2013) did not play for us again
" yahi baat gail or pollard par bhi lagu hoti he
 He said, "if Pollard had played Test cricket at the age of 26-27, he might have become a very good Test cricketer, but he thought it appropriate to play in shorter formats
 is tarah se hamane ek khilaadi ganvaa diya
 Even Evin Lewis can play Test cricket, but he does not want to

 Hooper gave another example, which could harm the Test team

 ’ Before the Lok Sabha elections, the process of changing the party has started

 shivasena ke akhbaar saamana main guuruuvaar ko lekh likhaa gaya he ki bhartiya janata party yaa phir shivasena ko congress waalon ke liye palnaghar nahin bananaa chahie, ham aisa sochate hai
 It has been written in the face that if the Hindutva parties have to go ahead with the angry people of congress-nationalist, then what should they do for years, who have taken the saffron flag of ideas? The article has written that Congress and corruption These two are alternative words of each other, says Modi
 duusari baat aisi he ki congress-rashtravaadi kaa ‘inakming’ aaj apane ghar main laabhadaayak lag rahaa hoga magar baad main wo takalifdeh sabit ho saktaa he
 Let me tell you that this article of Shiv Sena has come when Sujay, the son of rival party leader Radhakrishna vikhe-patil, has entered the Bharatiya Janata Party
 bijepi jwine karte vakt sujay patil ne kaha tha ki pita or parivaar kii ichha ke khilaaf jaakar maine yah nirnay liya he
 Shiv Sena has written that Chhote Patil wants to become an MP anyhow, he has come to BJP because he hopes that he will get a ticket in the Lok Sabha elections
 shivasena ne kaha ki abhi kai aise or bhi netaa hai jo bhaajapa main aane kii qatari main khadey hai or bijepi vaale aisa hota dekh kaaphi khush dikh rahe hai
 The article said that if the Shiv Sena is the Chief Minister tomorrow, then the remote Shiv Sena will be in the quake of the earthquake and these houses will stand in the queue of the Shiv Sena building
 isliye apane log or mul vichaar hi sach hai
 However, in the end, the Sena welcomed the people who joined the BJP
 gauratlab he ki beete chaar saal main shivasena lagaataar modi sarkaar ke khilaaf bayaanbaji karti rahi he
 Despite this, both parties have now come together for the Lok Sabha elections

 ’mishra ne kaha ki trinmul sadasyon ne vidhansabha main marpet kii, jiske baad unki party ke vidhayak gaurang chattopadhyaay ko aspataal main bhartee hona padaa
 He said, "not only was Chattopadhyay beaten up, but also the woman MLA of our party Debolina Hembram was scrambled and abusive language was used against her
 ’esaxkeem rajkeey aspataal main pravesh karne se purv chattopadhyaay ne kaha, ‘mere sir par kisi baari cheez se baar-baar prahaar kiya gaya
 On the other hand, Trinamool Congress leader and state Parliamentary Affairs Minister Partha Chatterjee rejected Mishra's claim and said that two Trinamool mlas Mahmuda Hosain and Pulak Roy were severely beaten by CPI (M) members
 unhen aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 Meanwhile, the Left Front termed the suspension of three of its mlas as 'unconstitutional' and staged a sit-in outside the assembly demanding an end to the suspension

 This time it will not happen
 kendra sarkaar ne sabhi vibhaagon se kaha he ki vah vitt varsh khatm hone se pehle apane khajaane ko khaali na karen
 This instruction has been given by the government because of the fund raising exercise for the Seventh Pay Commission
 vitt mantralay ke mutabik kendra sarkaar agle vitt varsh ke liye vibhaagon ko atirikt grant nahin degi kyonki saatven vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko lagu karne ke liye fund ekatrit karne kaa dabaav uske upar he
 However, the Finance Ministry has excluded expenditure on MNREGA from this directive

 2
 vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko lagu karne se selary paane vaale karmchaariyon ke paas cash- donon vaastavik or digital main badhottaree hogi
 Its direct benefit will be seen in the form of increase in consumption in the country

 There is also a danger of increasing inflation in the country due to high demand for consumer goods

 Due to this, the inflation rising through demand will not be a big problem for the common man and the government

 The Reserve Bank is appealing to all banks to reduce the interest rate on the expectation of a positive impact of the Seventh Pay Commission

 lalit modine sushamaa swaraj ke pati swaraj kaushal ke saamne indophil (indofil) company main diarector kaa pad sanbhaalane kaa prastaav rakhaa tha
 However, later Lalit Modi himself stopped the letter related to it

 Aaj Tak has a copy of this document

 Surjewala said, 'congress President Sonia Gandhi never asked Lalit Modi for any help

 Team India T20 captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has decided to take Suresh Raina to bat at number four keeping in mind the World T20
 srilanka ke khilaaf up captain viraat kohli kii gairmaujuudagi main raina ke tisare number par khilne kii ummid jataai ja rahi he lekin dhoni ne kaha ki team raina ke chauthe number par ballebaaji karne ko hi praathamikta degi
 However, Dhoni also said that he too had thought of landing him (raina) at number three for a moment
 teen maichon kii tii20 siries ke mangalvaar ko hone vaale pehle match se pehlemhendra singh dhonine kaha, ‘yah hamaare dimag main aayaa tha (raina kaa tisare number par istemaal karnaa) lekin yah thodaa behatar hoga ki vah (raina) us sthaan par ballebaaji kare jis sthaan parworld tii20main uske sabase adhik khilne kii sambhaavna he
 Dhoni said, "we have to give him experience because our team doesn't play a lot of T20 matches
 aam taur par ham ek match kii siries khelte hai
 This series will give us enough time to test at number four
 kisi or ko chauthe number par ballebaaji karaane or use ek sthaan upar khilaane se behatar yah hoga ki ham use chauthe sthaan par hi khilaae jisase ki vah saamanjasy baitha sake
 Raina, who performed brilliantly in the T20 format in the IPL, will play his 50th T20 International on Tuesday and he will be the second Indian batsman to achieve this feat after captain Dhoni
 srilanka ke khilaaf shuru ho rahi siries ke sandarbh main dhoni ne kaha ki isamen or phir isi maah bangladesh main hone vaale asia cap ke jariye bhartiya team ke paas world tii20 championships se purv lay main aane kaa mauka hoga
 Dhoni said, 'we will play only T20 format for some time now
 is siries ke baad asia cap, kuch abhyaas match or world tii20 hoga
 It has given us a chance to get into the rhythm because different formats have different needs
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki yah saamanjasy baitaane kaa mauka degaa
 The last three matches in Australia (india swept 3–0) will also help and the conditions here will be the same as we get in the ICC World T20
 ’ dhoni ne kaha ki team kaaphi santulit najar aa rahi he or aathven number par hardik pandya jaise khilaadi kii maujuudagi se ballebaaji main gaharaai bhi he
 He said, 'the team looks very balanced at the moment
 agar aap sabhi 15 khilaadiyon ko dekhen jo yah aisi team lagati he jisamen sthirataa he
 We have the option of using Hardik Pandya as the fast bowling all-rounder
 ’ dhoni ne kaha, ‘yuvaraj singh ne hamaare liye acchhee gendbaaji kii or raina bhi spin gendbaaji kar saktaa he
 It seems to be a well balanced team
 ham bhaagyashaalee hai ki ham aathven number tak ballebaaji kar sakate hai
 If Hardik comes to bat at number eight, the above batsmen will have a chance to bat freely
 or agar yah nokout match hoga to isse madad milegi

 melbern test ke pehle din bhartiya gendbaajon ne muqabla barabari kaa banaae rakhaa, haalanki din kaa khel khatm hone tak yah tay ho gaya tha ki duusare din bhartiya gendbaazon kii mushkil badhane vaali he
 The reason for this was that Australian captain Steven Smith was on the wicket
 vah 72 ran banaakar khel rahe the
 As feared, it happened on the second day of the Melbourne Test
 steven smith ne lagaataar tisare test main teesraa shatak thok diya
 He did not stop by scoring a century, but also completed his first 150 runs, although Smith may not have completed the first double century of his career, but as captain he has brought his team to the point where the team only May think of victory
 smith ne shaayad nahin sochaa ho lekin agar ve doharaa shatak puraa kar lete to sabase kam umr main doharaa shatak banane vaale captain kaa record unke naam hota
 Don Bradman set the record in 1937 at the age of 28 years and 131 days
 25 saal or 208 din ke smith ke paas is record ko banane ke liye abhi kaaphi vakt he
 However, his innings for the Melbourne Test was not just a captaincy innings, but he also inspired his fellow players to score runs
 pehle unhone shaan marsh ke saath ardhashtakeey saajhedaari nibhaai, phir bread hadine ke saath milakar 110 ran jode, michel johnson ke saath 50 ran, uske baad aathven wicket ke liye rain haris ke saath milakar 106 ran, nauven wicket ke liye unhone nethan leyon ke saath milakar 48 ran jode
 Now take a look at his innings in this Test series, 162 not out in the first innings of the Adelaide Test, 52 runs without being dismissed in the second innings
 bristben test kii pehali pari main behtareen 133 ran to duusari pari main ran out hone se pehle 28 ran, iske baad melbern main 192 ran
 During this time it is also important to note that he scored a century for the team in every situation when the team needed it the most
 beete 14 test maichon main steven smith ne saatvin baar shatak banaaya he
 How his centuries prove to be for the Australian team can be gauged from the fact that when he scored six centuries before Melbourne, the team managed to win the Test five times while one match was drawn
 isamen england ke khilaaf ashes siries hasil karne ke liye perth or sidney main joardaar shatak shaamil hai
 a century against South Africa in Centurion is also in this list to make Australia the number one team in Tests
 captain banane ke baad to unhone apane pehle donon test main shatak bana diya he
 Smith is only the fifth captain to reach the feat after Vijay Hazare, Jackie mcgilloo, Sunil Gavaskar and Alastair Cook, who have completed centuries in both the first Tests
 ab ek aise cricketer ke bare main sochie, jise jab pehali baar australian test team main 2010 main chunaa gaya tha, to unhen spin gendbaaz nethan haaritz kii jagah bulaayaa gaya tha or ye mana ja rahaa tha ki ye spinner ek din shen worne kii jagah legaa
 The Australia selectors did not have the right thinking, in which he was looking for Warne, he proved to be a strong batsman, a great fielder and a potential leader, who has now undoubtedly become a big star of Australian cricket

 The Supreme Court has asked whether all these should be given benefit of zero period or not
 is maamle kii agali sunwaayee 8 may ko hogi
 Let me tell you that during the hearing in the court, Vishnu Sharma on behalf of noida-greater Noida Authority said that Amrapali appealed for relief in repayment of arrears under zero period citing the order of NGT and Allahabad High Court to stop the construction in the last four years
 Was planted iske alaava amrapali hartbeet project par bhi report talab kii gai he
 Let me tell you that even before this, the apex court took a tough stand in this case

 And who will put the money in them
