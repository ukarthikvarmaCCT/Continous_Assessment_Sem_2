 On this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that Congress and its partners should stop playing this game of ruining the youth of the country
 saath hi piem modi ne kaha ki kahin na kahin congress or urban naksal kii sajeesh he
 They have been behind us for the last 20 years and are constantly plotting
 piem modi ne kaha ki meraa desh ke collejon or uniwarsities ke yuva saathiyon se bhi aagrah he ki aap apane mahatv ko samajhen or jahaan aap pard rahe hai un sansthaanon kaa mahatv samajhen
 Discuss, debit about the government's decisions and policies
 agar aapako kuch galat lagata he to loktantric tareeke se pradarshan karen, sarkaar tak apni baat pahunchaaen
 This government listens to your every feeling, every emotion
 unhone kaha ki congress or uske saathi or kuch urban naksali kahin na kahin iske sajeesh main hai
 The names of the Congress and the Left parties are different and the exploits are the same
 pradhanmantri ne raily main kaha ki congress kii baanto or raaj karo isi niti kii vajah se desh kaa ek baar bantwaaraa ho chukaa he
 The pieces of Maa Bharati have been done before
 yahi congress he jisane avaidh tareeke se lakhon ghuspaithiyon ko bharat main ghusane diya, yahaan unako votbank ke naam par istemaal kiya
 He said that the Congress and its allies are also responsible for the problems that have arisen due to the intruders
 main phir se spasht kar duun, bharat sarkaar kaa ek hi granth he baba sahab ambedkar kaa diya hua samvidhan
 
 
 One mantra is paramount for us and one mantra is our inspiration
 piem modi ne kaha ki puure desh ne is congress or uske saathiyon kii nakaaratmak soch ko hi nakaar diya
 But to scare people, to spread false things, they have made the basis of their politics
 jhooth failaa kar or dar kaa maahaul banaakar hi wo apni puraani aadat ke bharose hi chal rahe hai
 These white liars have started talking about the Citizenship Amendment Act, and have started scaring people
 congress, uske jaise dalon or uske vampanthi echosystem ne puri takat jhonk di he
 Explain that while addressing a public meeting at Barheet in Sahibganj district of Jharkhand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that this time the same thing is being heard everywhere

 BJP again
 unhone kaha ki jab camel kaa phool khilata he to garib, mahilaon, yuvaaon, puure samaaj kaa bhala hota he
 Attacking the Congress, PM Modi said that today i openly challenge the Congress and their allies to declare openly that if they have the courage, they are ready to give citizenship of India to every citizen of Pakistan
 desh unka hisaab chuktaa kar degaa
 The PM said that if there is courage in Congress and its allies, then also declare openly that they will implement Article 370 again in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh
 agar himmat he, to wo ye bhi khulkar ghoshnaa karen ki teen talaak ke khilaaf jo kanoon bana he, use radd kar denge
 The Congress and its allies accept this challenge and declare it openly or else they should stop doing guerrilla politics by lying to the country, spreading confusion and making others their shield
 congress or uske saathi desh ke yuvaaon ko barbaad karne kaa ye khel khelnaa band kar den
 PM Modi said that the entire country rejected the negative thinking of this Congress and its allies
 lekin logon ko daraane ko, juthi baaten failaane ko unhone apni raajnneeti kaa aadhaar bana liya he
 By spreading lies and creating an atmosphere of fear, they are running on their old habits
 naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon ko lekar phir ye safed jhooth bolne lage hai, logon ko daraane lage hai
 PM Modi said that i want to tell the whole country, every citizen of the country, whether Hindu or Muslim, that this law will not affect the citizenship of any Indian citizen
 hamane jo kanoon banaaya he wo to hamaare pados ke teen deshon main, dharmik atyaachaar kii vajah se bharat aane vaale logon ke liye banaaya gaya he
 It is designed for those who have been in a very pathetic condition for years, who have no way of returning
 unhone kaha ki main poochna chahta hum ki aakhir isamen bhartiya musalamaanon, yaa kisi bhi bhartiya naagarik ke adhikaron kaa hanan kahaan hota he
 The Congress and its allies want to cook their political slang by trying to intimidate and intimidate Muslims on this issue
 naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon na kisi bhartiya kaa adhikaar chhinta he, na hi use kisi tarah kaa nuksaan pahunchaata he

 At the same time, his presence will also increase the enthusiasm among the party leaders and workers
 dilachasp ye he ki is baar congress ne ‘jan aashirwad yatre’ ke pehle charan kii tulana main badlaav kiya he
 This time, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah will not stay with Rahul during the yatra
 siddharmaailag se prachaar ke liye niklenge
 KC Venugopal, Congress incharge for Karnataka, says our two important star campaigners are - 'rahul Gandhi and Chief Minister Siddaramaiah
 ham prachaar ke is daur main puure rajya ko cover karnaa chaahate hai, lekin samay kam he
 In view of this, it was decided that Rahul Gandhi and half of the state would be covered by Siddaramaiah
 aisa karne se ham zyada se zyada logon tak pahunchane main safal rahenge
 According to Venugopal, the Congress president will campaign in Uttara Kannada region on 26 April
 vahaan se 27 april ko rahul kurg or mangalore kaa rukh karenge
 Rahul will return to Delhi on 28 April
 iske baad rahul 3 or 4 may ko gulberga or bangalore (gramin) kshetra kaa daura karenge

 In the first phase of 'jan Ashirwad Yatra', Chief Minister Siddaramaiah was present with Rahul Gandhi at all times
 is charan main rajya se party ke or netaa bhi yatra main shaamil rahe
 By doing this, where the party appeared united, the differences of the leaders did not get a chance to come to the surface
 iske alaava netaaon or party kaaryakartaaon ke bich duuri kam karne main bhi madad mili
 The visit of Congress President Rahul Gandhi to famous temples and monasteries at the places of visit was also the highlight of the first phase

 The politics of India is more than that of the sensitive common man onion
 phir dilli main to pyaaj-politics kii itani paraten saamne aa chuki hai or itani gandh fail chuki he ki iske aage laal pyaaj bhi sharminda ho jaae
 NAFED, which is associated with the central government, says that the Delhi government does not want to buy cheap onions, then the Delhi government is accusing Nafed of spreading confusion on the defensive, although Nafed has a lot of evidence to say his words, then Delhi The government has nothing but statements, which prove the contradiction of the government's changing statements every day
 dilli sarkaar ke mantri ne kiya tha daawaado din pehle hi dilli sarkaar ke khaadya or aapurti mantri aseem khan ne ajtak ke saath exclusive intervyuu main taal thonk kar kaha ki dilli sarkaar nafed sepyaaj lene ko taiyaarhe, chaahe wo 19 rupye kilo den, 20 rupye kilo den yaa 25 rupye kilo den
 Because the government's objective is to provide cheap onions to Delhi, but on Friday morning the Delhi government sent a letter to NAFED in which it was written that the Delhi government wishes to buy onions from NAFED but has two conditions
 dilli sarkaar kii do shartenpahali shart ye ki pyaaj kii keemat 19 rupye hi honi chahie usase zyada nahin or is 19 rupye main bhandaaran nuksaan jise storage los kehete hai or parivahan yani transportesan kaa kharch bhi shaamil he or duusari ye ki pyaaj kii delivery bhi sarkaar ko dilli ke anand vihaar main chahie, na ki wo nasik se pyaaj legi
 This is the cleanliness and proposal of NAFED
 Now the statement of NAFED is that the Delhi government is clearly working to pull the case
 nafed ke diarector ashok thakur ne bataaya- 'centre ne piesuef yani price stabiligeshan fund ke tahat dilli ke cote main 2500 metric ton pyaaj alag rakhwai he
 We have been writing a letter to the Delhi government since April saying that the Delhi government should buy onion at the same price at which the onion is taken from the farmers, the onion will be received from Nashik because the NAFED storage is there
 saath hi dilli sarkaar apana ek afasar bhi nasik bheje jo tamaam aupchaariktaayen puri kare
 AAP spokesperson Ashutosh alleged that the Aam Aadmi Party, which came to the rescue of its government, is making even more childish arguments
 party ke pravaktaa ashutosh aarope lagaate hai ki nafed dilli ko gumraah kar rahi he
 Neither are they willing to believe that Nafed wrote letters to the Delhi government from April to June and neither is willing to believe that Nafed was ready to give cheap onions to the Delhi government
 maje kii baat ye he ki dilli sarkaar yaa phir aam aadmi party netaaon ke paas bachaav main sirf aarope hai, koi saboot nahin
 According to Nafed director Ashok Thakur, Puramamala does not have to buy or sell cheap onions
 maamla us 2500 metric ton ke pyaaj ke stock ko uthaane kaa he jo centre sarkaar ne dilli ke naam par surakshit rakhaa he
 The role of NAFED is merely that of an intermediary

 pataudi) ondec 13, 2018 at 11:34 pm PST Let's tell Sara Ali Khan's debut in Bollywood is considered successful
 unke intervyuu in dinon kaaphi charchaa main hai
 Fans discuss their Confident attitude and smartness
 pichley dinon sara kaa kaam film kedarnath main dekhne ke baad unki daadi sharmila tagore ne kaha, mujhe sara par garv he, uskaa kaam or aatmavishvaas dekhakar to main khud use pahchaan nahin saki thi
 Ramadan has started in India
 is dauraan musalmaan ek maheene tak roje rakhte hai
 During the fast, the daily eaters do not eat anything or drink anything
 ramadan main musalmaan suraj ke nikalne se pehle subah-subah sahari karte hai or suraj ke ast hone par apana rojaa iftaar ke saath kholte hai
 The times of Sahri and Iftar in different countries of the world are different every year as well as the hours of fasting are also different
 isse har desh ke logon ke liye rojaa rakhane kii chunauti alag-alag ho jaati he
 But the most important challenge in all of this is Norwegian because often the date changes while waiting for the sun to sink here and the sun does not budge from its place
 philhal, is saal yahaan din ke lagbhag 20 ghanton tak suraj aasmaan main bana rahata he
 There are around two lakh Muslims in Norway
 ramajaan ke paak maheene kii shuruyaat karte hue norge kii masjidon par latake laudspikar subah paanch baje ke aasapaas ajaan dekar elaan kar dete hai ki rojaa rakhane kaa vakt shuru ho gaya he
 Then when the sun sets, wait for the ajaan who will tell that it is time to fast iftar
 yah intjaar yahaan lanbaa he kyonki suraj to din ke 20 ghante yahaan chamakta hi rahata he
 Now there is a big dilemma among the Muslims living here that how should they celebrate this festival of fasting from sun rise to sunrise
 Will they have to drink and eat for 20 hours a day or can there be a middle ground for their dilemma? Now according to Islamic hadith, in the Pak month of Ramadan, Allah has compelled the true Muslim to fast during the day and to pray at night
 lihaaja, norge or aasapaas ke kuch deshon main musalamaanon ko 20 ghante se adhik rojaa rakhana pad rahaa he or bache hue 2-3 ghante agle din ke roje kii taiyaari main lagaana pad rahaa he
 Actually, the date of Ramadan is determined from the lunar calendar, so every year this festival goes forward 11 days
 lihaaja beete 2 saal ke dauraan hi ramajaan kaa maheenaa garmi ke us samay par pahunch gaya he jab din ke mahaj 2-3 ghante ke liye yahaan suraj ast hota he
 Earlier Ramadan took place in the summer of 1980s but at that time there was negligible Muslim population
 ab is baat par zyaadaatar muslim leader bhi ekamat hai ki hadith ke mutabik aise ilaakon main rah rahe musalamaanon ko suraj doobane tak rojaa jari rakhana hoga
 At the same time, some Muslims tried to get Fatwa from Saudi Arabia to allow them to fast according to the time of Mecca
 lekin aisa nahin ho sakaa or unke saamne chunauti jas kii tas he ki kis tarah din ke 20 ghante se adhik samay tak bina khaae pie puure ek maheene is parv ko manaaen
 Hope the prayer gives so much power that how this month has passed is not known

 ) The Narendra Modi government at the Center on Friday presented the last and interim budget of its tenure
 chunki kuch hi maheene main desh main aam chunaav hone hai, isliye kaarykaal puraa kar rahi sarkaar parampara ke anusaar antarim vajet pesh karti he
 The Union Government, standing at the mouth of the Lok Sabha elections, has made many populist promises in this budget
 isamen kisaanon ke khate main cash transfar, 5 lakh tak kii aay waalon ko tex main maafee ke saath-saath asangathit kshetra ke mazdooron ko pension sambandhi kai bade elaan kiye hai
 Former Finance Minister P
 chidambaram ne is bajet ko vot kaa hisaab-kitaab bataaya he
 As per the customary practice in the country, the government completing the term presents the interim budget, and sometimes the vote on account is also presented in place of the interim budget
 chunki maujuuda sarkaar ke paas kaarykaal kaa kuch hi samay hota he, isliye navgathit sarkaar dwaara purna bajet pesh karne tak kaa kharch vahan karne ke liye sarkaar ko sansad se anumati leni hoti he
 Hence, no major announcements and policy decisions are usually taken by the government in such a budget
 isliye isamen maatr kuch maheenon ke aay or vyay kaa byora bhar hota he
 Because the present government cannot impose its financial decisions on the incoming government
 haalanki antarim bajet naam kaa koi shabd samvidhan main maujuud nahin he, lihaaja yah bas ek swasthy loktantric parampara kaa hissaa bhar he
 But in this budget, the Modi government at the center announced an exemption from tax on income up to 5 lakh, direct cash transfer to the account of small and marginal farmers
 haalanki sarkaar ne iske liye dhan kaa aavanton maatr chaalu vittiya varsh ke liye kiya he
 At the same time, the central government has also announced a new pension scheme for laborers in the unorganized sector
 jiske tahat 100 rupee pratimah premium ke bhugtan par 60 saal kii aayu ke baad unhen 3000 rupee pratimah pension dene kaa elaan kiya gaya he
 These are all such schemes, which will bear the burden of the incoming government
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad jo nai sarkaar banegi niyamat: use hi purna bajet pesh karne kaa adhikaar hota he
 But the stakes that the Modi government has played by making such big announcements in its interim budget will have to be stretched even bigger by the incoming government to reverse it
 masalan 5 lakh tak kii aay ko tex ke daayre se baahar rakhane kaa faisla madhyam varg ke liye badi raahat kii khabar he
 To reverse this decision, the incoming government will have to make a bigger announcement
 isi tarah kisaanon kaa mudda haal ke dinon itnaa samvedansheel ho chalaa he ki unke hit main kiye gaye chote se chote faisle ko chhedana aag main haath jhulajhane ke samaan hoga
 The government has no constitutional prohibition to change the tax in its final and interim budget
 lekin loktantric parampara kaa sammaan karte hue ab tak is bhav kaa khyal rakhaa gaya he ki isamen bade nitigat badlaav or nai yojanaon kaa elaan na kiya jaae
 Sometimes the government introduces the Vote on Account instead of the Interim Budget, in which the government has to get the approval of the Parliament to withdraw funds from the Consolidated Fund to run government spending
 aaazaad bharat kaa pehla antarim bajet morarji desai ne 1962-63 main pesh kiya tha
 Since then, 12 interim budgets have been presented so far

 isro ke chairman dow
 Kailashwadivu Sivan, in a special conversation with Group Editorial Director Raj Chengappa, detailed Des's first manned space mission
 kuch anshampra
 India will be the fourth country after the US, Russia and China to send manned missions to space
 antariksh main insaan ko bhejne ke bare main itnaa khaas kya he? ham aisa kyon kar rahe hai—kya yah pahie ko dobaaraa ijad karne kii tarah nahin he?asal main baat sirf antariksh main insaan ko bhejne kii nahin he
 The level of understanding of the whole country about science and technology will increase
 yah yuvaaon ko kuch nayaa karne ko prerit karegaa or unhen vigyaan ke kaaryakramon main hissaa lene ke liye badhaava degaa
 Many institutions and industries are associated with this particular project
 is lihaaj se yah mahaj isro kaa project nahin balki rashtriya project he
 Every Indian agency involved can display its talent and the country can be proud of it
 science or technology main ham viksit deshon ke baraabar hai
 What are the major challenges that ISRO has to overcome? Whatever technology we have is associated with launching satellites
 magar jab ham insaan ko launch karte hai, to ejineering or takneekee pahaluon ke alaava isamen inasaani baaten, life sciensej bhi aate hai
 We have to make sure that humans are safe inside the module and all the conditions are the same as on earth
 aisa maahaul taiyaar karnaa or aisa vaataavaran bananaa hamaare liye chunauti he, yah hamaare liye nayaa he
 We have tried some of these works before, such as environment control and life support systems
 hamane spes suites par bahut sara adhyayan kiya he
 But now we need to take it further
 estronaut ke liye kis kism ke prashikshan kii jarurat hogi or koun iske laayak hoga?jaruri nahin he ki vah ladaaku payalat hi ho
 Anyone can go, provided they are psychologically, physically and mentally fit
 beshak ladaaku payalat kii majbootee or sahanshakti dusron ke mukaable behatar hogi
 But we are working on how to select and train them
 bangaluru main institute of arospes medicine ke paas estronaut ko prashikshan dene kii suvidhaayen hai
 He did the same thing for Rakesh Sharma
 magar hamen kahin zyada kathor prashikshan kii jarurat hogi or ho saktaa he, uske liye kshamtaayen viksit kerani paden
 In view of the target set by the Prime Minister, 2022, we may need international cooperation and use of external facilities and systems
 orbit main capsule pahunchane ke liye rocket launture ke bare main kya kahenge?uski kshamta hamaare paas pehle se hi he
 Our GSLV Mark 3 Heavy Lift Launcher is capable of carrying 10 tons of weight in Earth's orbit, while our space orbiter will weigh just seven tons
 niyamit satellite launch karte hue hamaara mukhya maandand zyada se zyada pelod he
 But the most important thing for human mission is maximum security
 isliye prakshepan vaahan pranali ko iskaa human-rated varjan (insaan ko le jane ke akalan par khara) hona hoga or hamen pakkaa karnaa hoga ki yah kisi bhi haalat main naakaam na ho or puri tarah surakshit rahe
 During the launch, the crew will also need a rescue system in case of failure? We have built and tested the cruiscape system
 keval launch ke dauraan hi nahin, agar udaan ke dauraan kisi bhi vakt estronaut ke liye koi afat yaa khatra hota he, to modul prakshepan vaahan se baahar nikal aayega or khatre ke daayre se dur ho jayega
 It includes a fast reacting solid motor and stabilization system for the launch vehicle
 hamane samudr main splashdown (chhapaak se utarane) ke baad phir se daakhil hone or behaal karne ke liye bhi modul kaa pareekshan kar liya he
 This includes protecting it from high temperatures and pressures when it re-enters the atmosphere on return
 kya aap orbitor kaa pareekshan pehle maanavrahit mishan ke saath karne kii yojana bana rahe hai?orbitor ko estronaut ke saath launch karne se pehle ham shuru se aakhir tak do-ek pareekshan karnaa chaahate hai
 We will also leave some rehearsal flights to test the atmosphere and life support systems as well as to avoid too much change in temperature and pressure
 in udaanon se orbitor par asar daal sakane vaali akashganga kii cosmik kirnon or sookshm ulkapindon se bachaav kaa pareekshan bhi hoga
 We will also do a splashdown of the orbiter
 hamen pakkaa karnaa hoga ki har cheez mukammal ho
 What is the total cost of this project? Will it cost less than what it costs in other countries? We are thinking that it will cost 10,000 crore
 hogi
 This is not too much
 aisa isliye he kyonki sari behad jaruri or ahm technology hamane hi viksit kii hai
 This vehicle also already exists
 hamaare liye akelaa kaam yah bachaa he ki launch ke liye prashikshan suvidha or buniyadi dhaanche kaa nirmaan kare

 Two new actors entered the film industry from Salman Khan's production Notebook
 notebook ek romantic film he jiske har seen ko behad romantic andaaj main pesh kiya gaya he
 Not much time was spent when teenagers shared love through books and pages
 apane-apane hisse kaa pyaar likhte the or pannon par umend kar rakh dete the apane dil kii sari baat
 It is no longer possible to express love in this digital world in this way
 magar jis kisi ne bhi apane jivan main is tarah se pyaar bayaan kiya he, notebook film unki ungali pakad unhen usee daur main lekar jaaegi
 Don't worry, not far behind because the digital media revolution has flourished in India only in the last decade
 jab tinder par pyaar dhunde jate hai or fasebuk par jataae jate hai
 Talking about the notebook, its scenes are quite romantic
 seens ko lekar film main kaaphi kaam kiya gaya he
 All the colors of love have been tried through the film
 film kii kahani kaaphi saral rakhi gai he
 The film is shot in Kashmir and the school looks beautiful in the middle of the lake
 The film is a love story of Kabir (zaheer Iqbal) and Firdaus (pranootan Bahl)
 film main zyada romance filmaane ke chakkar main ek galati ye ho gai ki isamen drama peeche chhot gaya
 In any Indian film, more than the romantic scenes, the audience seeks out that drama, Humer, who tells the story of a separation in the story of love
 judaai kii jhalkiyaan hon, rishton main kadavaahat aae or tab jab waapas milan hota he, pyaar ke nae beej ugte hai, rishte kii jad majboot hoti he or jivan main basant chahakta he
 The Notebook film shows the innocence of love easily, but where there is talk of love going deep, the film seems a little loose

 We artist people always like praise
 'unhone kaha ki agar film safal hoti he to iskaa ek hi matlab he ki kaaphi logon ne ise dekha he
 This makes us very happy
 jab ham logon ko yah pataa chalata he ki film asafal sabit huyi he to ham log sochate hai ki koi bhi ise dekhne ke liye nahin aayaa he

 When Rahul Gandhi became the Vice President of the Congress on January 19, party workers felt that everything would be back on track till the Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections to be held at the end of November
 ab jabaki chunaav main mahaj aath maheene bache hai, party main gutbandi or tikhi hoti ja rahi he
 Despite Rahul's efforts to resolve differences and strengthen the party, rhetoric between state Congress President Kantilal Bhuria and Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, close to party general secretary Digvijay Singh, has now started appearing in public forums
 rahul ke upaadhyaksh banane ke saath hi digvijay singh party maamalon kii kaman apane haath main lene kii koshish kar rahe hai or is puri prakriya main gutbaji bad rahi he
 It has come to light that Bhuria, on March 11, responded to a question from reporters in Bhopal about Scindia joining the race for the post of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister, "what else does Scindia want from the party?" He has been made Union Minister
 ''bhuriya ne yah tippanee sindhiya ke us bayaan ke thik do din baad kii thi jisamen sindhiya ne party kaaryakartaaon se nimad ke daure ke vakt poocha tha, ''mujhe avasar milane kii sthiti main kya aap meraa saath denge? '' unhone us vakt yah bhi kaha tha ki bhuriya ko sabhi ko apane saath lekar chalanaa chahie
 After becoming a minister, Scindia visited more than 17 districts of the state and during this time he gathered a good crowd
 yah dekh party ke bheetar unka virdohi khemaa jaraa bhi khush nahin hua
 Just a day after Bhuria's remarks, Rahul called him and Ajay Singh, the Leader of Opposition in the Assembly, for a New Delhi conversation
 ajay singh ke mutabik congress upaadhyaksh ne unase party ko majboot karne or rajya kii sadakon par utarkar logon ko bijepi shashan kii sachaai bataane ke liye kaha
 He has been called again after 45 days to carry on the conversation
 haalanki ajay singh se jab sindhiya or bhuriya ke bich jari jubaani jang ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone ise 'durbhagyapurna' bataaya
 This tension between the two veterans was first reported to Rahul on 6 March when in a meeting convened to hold talks with mps, Bhuria attacked Scindia, saying he was not uniting the state unit, he They do not even participate in the programs of the organization but are visiting the state fiercely
 tab sindhiya ne iskaa virodh karte hue kaha tha ki ve apane mantralay se sambandhit party ke kriyakalapon main hissaa le rahe hai
 Here, when the situation began to run amok, Rahul had to intervene
 rahul ne nai dilli main 15 farvari ko rajyon ke party pramukhon or vidhayak dal kii baithak kii adhyakshata kii thi
 In this meeting too, Bhuria complained to Rahul that Scindia and Union Minister Kamal Nath are not cooperating with the state unit
 rajnatik jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki bhuriya yah sab digvijay singh ke ishaaron par kar rahe hai, jo madhya pradesh main party maamalon kii kaman puri tarah se apane haath main lenaa chaahate hai or isliye unhone kantilal bhuriya kaa istemaal kar ek tir se do nishane lagane kii yojana banaai he
 Everything was fine till last year between Scindia and Bhuria
 pichley saal jab bhuriya ne cabinet chhodkar rajya ikai kii kaman sanbhali thi to sindhiya ne unke is kadam kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Due to this, Digvijay Singh, who was dreaming of sitting close to Ajay Singh on the Chief Minister's chair in the state, got restless
 sindhiya or bhuriya ne ek baithak ko pichley saal saath-saath sambodhit kiya tha
 But this happy relationship between the two did not last long
 congress main mushkilen khadi honi tab shuru Þeen jab digvijay singh ne 2 sitambar, 2012 ko kaha ki ve mukhyamantri pad ke liye sindhiya kaa samarthan karenge
 He told reporters, "if party president Sonia Gandhi fielded Scindia for the assembly elections, we will give her full support
" '' is bayaan ke baad sindhiya ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar banane ko lekar hallaa-gulla badhata gaya
 Digvijay Singh had cleverly given this statement, enthused by his scandalous statement, Scindia also excited his supporters in sentimentality
 khaas taur par party ke yuva netaaon ne pichley saal sitambar main hui baithak main sindhiya ko pradesh adhyaksh banane kii maang kii
 Even senior Congress leader Mahesh Joshi, once an ally of Digvijay Singh, met Congress President Sonia Gandhi along with some other leaders and demanded the appointment of Scindia in place of Bhuria
 lekin sonia ne unki yah maang khaarij kar di
 Actually, she had understood that Scindia Camp is campaigning to tarnish Bhuria's image
 party sutron kii maane to yahi vajah rahi ki congress alaakaman sindhiya ko aagaamee chunaav main koi badi jimmedaari dene kii apni yojana se peeche hat gaya he
 The body of Ram Singh, the main accused of Delhi gang rape victim, will be postmortem at AIIMS today
 postmortem kii report se uski maut se jude tamaam sawaalon ke jawaab milane kii ummid he
 On Monday, the news of the suicide of Ram Singh, which was closed in Tihar at around 6 am, was reported
 lekin jaruri kagaji karrwai main shaam ho gai
 Because of which post mortem of Ram Singh's body could not be done
 mangalvaar postmortem ke baad ram singh ke shav ko rishtedaaron ko saunp diya jayega
 Magistrate inquiry report of Ram Singh's death may also come today
 somvaar ko dilli gangrape ke aaropee kii maut ke baad dilli sarkaar ne maamle kii metropolitan magistrate se jaanch ke aadesh die the
 On the other hand, Tihar administration is also investigating why and how Ram Singh committed suicide despite tight security in the jail

 The case hearing is going on in fast track court
 ram singh is maamle kaa mukhya aaropee tha
 It will be interesting to see what effect Ram Singh's suicide has on this case

 On this, the Youth Congress had removed the post apologizing after Rahul Gandhi showed strict attitude
 aisa hi kuch manishankar ne jab ‘neech’ vaala bayaan diya tha to rahul ne unhen sidhaa party se nilambit kar diya
 The party has been silent on the video uploaded on the Congress' Twitter handle but the tweet has neither been withdrawn nor regretted
 aise main lagata yahi he ki congress shaayad ‘tel dekho or tel kii dhar dekho’ vaali niti par chalati dikh rahi he
 That is, if the work is done by keeping silence, then it will be seen otherwise when it will be too much

 The video has been uploaded by the party's social media team, headed by Divya Spandana
 aise main party ke media vibhaag ne philhal isse duuri bana lee, jiske mukhiya randeep surajevaala hai
 Perhaps the reason for the silence of the media department is that if the video turns upside down, then Gaz falls on the social media department

 For the sixth time in the Gujarat assembly elections, the BJP is going to adopt a strategy to hold a strong hold at the booth level to win the political war
 bijepi gujarat ke 50 hajaar boothon par 'man kii baat, chaay ke saath' kaarykram karegi
 Through this, BJP workers will visit state booths and discuss bjp's policies
 gujarat ke bijepi prabharee bhupendra yadav 26 navbanr ravivaar ko'man kii baat, chaay ke saath'kaarykram kaa aagaaj karenge
 BJP has adopted through this to win Gujarat's electoral battle
 bijepi gujarat ke pehle charan vaale kshetron ke boothon se 'man kii baat, chaay ke saath' kaarykram kaa shuru kar rahi he
 After completing the first stage booth program, the party will go to the second phase booths
 bataa den ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne chaay par charchaa kaarykram ke jariye desh kaa maahaul bijepimay kiya tha
 The result was that the BJP had registered a historic victory in the Lok Sabha elections
 pradhanmantri banane ke baad narendra modi ne logon se baat karne ke lieradio par man kii batkaaryakram kii shuruyaat kii he
 PM Modi talks about the mind on the last Sunday of every month
 bijepi ne is tarj par gujraj kii raajnneetik baaji ke liye 'man kii baat, chaay ke saath' kaarykram ko apanaaya he

 sirus mistre ko tata sans ke chairman pad se hataae jane ke baad shuru hua vivaad khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 Cyrus Mistry is leaving no chance to attack Ratan Tata and Tata Sons
 mistre ne ab kaha he ki yah kahana galat or sharaarat bharaa he ki unhone tata-docomo maamlen main jo karrwai kii vah apni marji se kii or ratan tata ko uski jaankaree nahin thi
 Cyrus Mistry called such discussions unfounded that the way the Docomo issue was handled did not match the culture and values of the group
 docomo saude ke bare main sabhi sabhi nirnay tata sans ke nideshak mandal kii sweekruti se liye gaye or sabhi kadam samuhik rup se liye jane vaale nirnyon ke anuroop hai
 Mistry has also dismissed such claims that the manner in which the case was fought against Docomo is not accepted by Rattan Tata Shaid
 bayaan main kaha gaya ki mistre ne hameshaa kaha ki tata-samooh ko kanoon ke anusaar apni sabhi patibaddhtaon kaa sammaan karnaa chahie
 Tata's suit with Docomo is significant as Japan's NTT Docomo Company is facing litigation with Tata Group over payment of shares
 docomo ne november 2009 main tata teleservices main 26
 5 percent stake
 us samay prati share 117 rupee ke bhav par sauda 12,740 karod rupee kaa tha
 At that time it was agreed that upon leaving the company within five years, it would be refunded at least 50 percent of the acquisition price
 docomo ne april 2014 main company se alag hone kaa nirnay kiya or 58 rupee prati share ke hisaab se 7,200 karod rupee kii maang rakhi
 But the Tata group gave him 23, citing a RBI rule
 34 rupee prati share kii dar se bhugtan kii peshkash kii
 Controversy escalated As per RBI rule, if a foreign company exits from investment, it cannot be paid more than the fixed price on the basis of profit on share capital
 japani company antarrashtriya panch nirnay prakriya main chali gai or uske paksh main 1
 The deal is worth $ 17 billion
 tata sans ne kaha he ki vah panchanirnay ke anupaalan kaa virodh karegi kyon ki vah bharat ke sthaneey kaayade kanoonon se bandhi he
 The statement issued by Mistry said that under his leadership, the Tata group requested Docomo to meet with him in this matter and ask permission from the Reserve Bank, but Docomo did not agree on it
 baharhaal tata samooh ne rigerv bank se manjuuri ke liye aavedan kiya par manjuuri nahin mili tathaa docomo antarrashtriya panchanirnay manch main chali gai
 The Tata group sought permission from the Reserve Bank to pay the verdict amount instead of challenging the verdict of the UK Panchnirnay court

 They have to destroy these gangs, whether they are active from anywhere and working for any purpose
 pakistan kii janata or vahaan kii sarkaar se sadbhaavna or sanjidagi dikhaane kaa aahvaan karte hue pradhanmantri ne kaha ki main pehle bhi kah chukaa hum ki agar aisa hota he to jawaab dene main bharat bhi peeche nahin rahegaa
 Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal has issued a letter explaining why he decided to contest from Varanasi against Narendra Modi

 Where the JDU is getting divided on the Citizenship Amendment Bill, the Congress, which forms the government in collaboration with Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, has also come face to face on this issue
 congress netaa rahul gandhi ne is mudde par 'naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak samvidhan par hamalaa he
 Whoever supports it is attacking the foundations of our country and trying to destroy it
 ' aapako bataa den ki is shivasena ne is naagarikta sanshodhan bill par loksabhaa main sarkaar ke paksh main vot daalaa he
 At the same time, Shiv Sena is openly supporting the government on this issue
 shivasena ke saansad arvind saavant se poocha gaya ki kya party rajyasabha main bill kaa samarthan karegi to unhone kaha, alag-alag bhoomika hoti kya hamaari? raashtra hit kii bhoomika lekar shivasena khadi rahati he is par kisi kaa ekadhikaar nahin he

 The Congress party made its formal announcement today
 gauratlab he ki lavali kii ummidavaari kaa elaan congress apni pehali hi list main kar chuki thi
 Now the party says that instead of being tied to a constituency, Lovely will work to strengthen the organization throughout Delhi
 isliye dilli ke prabharee pisi chaako kaa kahana he ki party ne unase chunaav nahin ladane kaa anurodh kiya jise unhone maan liya he
 a new name will be announced in his place tomorrow or Monday
 lekin lavali ke maidan se hatane ke peeche kii vajah itani sidhi nahin bataayi ja rahi
 It is being said that Lovely Ajay was angry with Maken for being given the command of the campaign committee
 haalanki maakan ko prachaar samiti kii kaman saunpe jane kaa aupchaarik elaan 13 janvari ko hua lekin party main isaki taiyaari pehle se chalane lagi thi
 Lovely passed away because he was given the command of the party when the party faced a crushing defeat in the last Delhi elections
 tab se lavali lagaataar party ko khadaa karne main dinaraat mehnat kar rahe the
 Maken is considered close to Rahul Gandhi and Rahul's role has been instrumental in making Maken the head of the 101-member campaign committee
 ain vakt par maakan ko aage karne se lavali ko jhatka laga
 However, Lovely himself is clearly denying any such anger
 unka kahana he ki party lavali se badi he or party kii taraf se di gai zimmedaari uthaane ko ve hameshaa taiyaar rahete hai
 He says that he had proposed Maken's name, so there is no question of controversy
 udhar ajay maakan ne bhi lavali ke saath kisi tarah ke matbhed yaa party main kisi gutbazi se inkaar kiya he
 He says that his trio with Lovely and Aaron Yusuf have been working together in Delhi for more than 15 years and there is no question of division
 ek jaankaree yah bhi kahati he ki gandhinagar se lagaataar chaar baar jeet rahe lavali ko is baar haar kaa dar sata rahaa tha, isliye unhone apana naam waapas liya
 However, Lovely calls it absurd and says that she has full faith in the people of Gandhinagar and will win any candidate she has stood for on the way she has won them
 mana ja rahaa he ki gandhinagar ke block adhyaksh surendar sharma congress ke ummidavaar banaae ja sakate hai

 bispi supremeo mayawati ke khilaaf abhadra bayaanbaji ko lekar bhale hi bijepi alaakaman ne apane netaa dayashankar singh ko party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya ho, lekin patni swati singh ne saamne aakar jis tarah se mayawati ke khilaaf morcha sambhala, usne bijepi ke bheetar hi bheetar dayashankar ke samarthan main dabaav paidaa kar diya he
 There is also a rumor among the party leaders that the BJP took a very strict action against Dayashankar Singh in a hurry
 aise main dayashankar ko party main waapas lene kii maang bhi ho rahi he
 Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Ballia, in a special conversation with 'aaj Tak', has made it clear that even though he used to misbehave by using indecent language against BSP supremo Mayawati, it does not give his supporters the right to make abusive statements against his family
 bharat singh ke mutabik, agar mayawati nasimudin siddiki ko party se baahar nahin karatin hai, to wo bijepi alaakaman se maang karte hai ki dayashankar singh ko fouran bijepi main waapas liya jaae
 Apologize to Dayashankar's wife and daughter Mayawati Bharrat Singh was asked the question that once the BJP has shown the way out of the party to Dayashankar Singh, what wrong message will not go from his demand for his return? On this, he says that the party has started the movement 'in honor of the daughter-bjp is in the field' on the instructions of the high command
 ye andolan tab tak nahin rukegaa, jabatak kimayawatiapane netaaon kii galat bayani ke liye sakht karrwai nahin karatin
 At the same time, he will also have to apologize to Dayashankar's wife-minor daughter
 agar wo aisa nahin karti hai, to bijepi sadak se sadan tak bispi supremeo ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane main koi kami nahin karegi
 Be pitted against Siddiqui According to Poxobharat Singh, the leaders who have lived under the leadership of Mayawati have come out of the BSP
 bispi ke varisht netaa jugalkishor or swami prasad maury ne hi un par sabase pehle ye aarope lagaaya tha
 Bharat Singh has also rejected the explanation of Mayawati in the case
 bakaul singh, 'aakhir kisi kii patni or naaballig beti ko pesh karne ke elaan kaa matlab kya hota he
 This irresponsible statement should be filed against Nasimuddin Siddiqui under POCSO
 ' unhone kaha ki nasimuddin ne rape ke liye uksaane vaala bayaan diya he
 The UP government and police administration should take immediate action in this context

 Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari said that this was confirmed by Minister Arun Jaitley without the ministry himself
 ye saamaanya baat nahin he ki koi kendriya mantri blog likh kar saream jaanch agency par sawaal uthaae
 Now that the suitbooted agencies are in the grip, their people in the government are saying 'investigative adventurism' in their defense
 sarkaar dwaara inhen agenciyon ko khuli chhot di jaati he jab wo vipakshi netaaon ke khilaaf jhuthe maamle darj karte hai

 manish tiwari ne kaha ki hamaara sawaal he kiaropee ke maansik tanaav ke kaaran jaanch band karne kaa kya matlab he?kya jaanch isliye band hui kyonki goyal CBDT ke mukhiyasushil chandra ke sambandhi hai? pradhanmantri, vittamantri jawaab den ki kya ye kadam sarkaar ke kalaadhan khatm karne ke daawey ke anukool he?sarkaar iske jariye sandesh kya dena chaahati he?is puure maamle kii baariki se jaanch honi chahie taaki sachai desh ke saamne aa sake

 yechuri ne elaan kiya ki tel kii badi hui keemton ko lekar jaldi hi bada jan aakrosh or jan andolan hoga
 Accusing the Modi government of lying, Yechury said that this government is based on lies
 centre sarkaradwara rajyon ko ho rahi kamai kii daleel par palatwaar karte hue yechuri ne kaha, centre sarkaar petrol ke daam main 36 se ₹40 kaa tex leti he
 It is a sheer lie that prices are increasing due to the state governments
 yechuri ne sawaal uthaaya ki agar kerala kii vampanthi sarkaar ₹1 prati litre tel kii keemten kam kar sakati he to bijepi shasit 21 rajyon main petrol or dijal kii keemten kam kyon nahin ho rahi hai? vipakshi netaa ne centre sarkaar par jhuthe aankade pesh karne ke saath tel kii badi keemton ko desh kii janata ke saath lut qaraar diya

 sansad ke monsoon satr main centre sarkaar ke khilaaf pesh avishvaas prastaav 20 july ko baari maton (126 ke mukaable 325) ke antar se gir gaya
 The Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government did not have to work very hard to counter the weak opposition
 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) or uske sahyogi is jeet se khush bhi najar aae, par isane unki chunautiyon ko bhi ujagar kar diya he
 At the same time, for the last four years, the oppressed opposition seems to be in a position to confront the government for the first time
 chunautiyon kii isi dastak ke kaaran bhaajapa ne 2019 kii apni ranneeti ko nae sire se parakhnaa or badalanaa shuru kar diya he
 Challenges from their own The Shiv Sena, the constituent of the NDA, raised a big challenge of the BJP during the motion of no confidence
 shivasena centre or maharashtra kii bhaajapa sarkaar main sahyogi he
 Actually, Shiv Sena did not support BJP by being absent in Parliament during the motion of no confidence
 iske baavjood ki bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne ek din pehle hi party pramukh uddhav thakare se baatcheet kii thi or ummid kii ja rahi thi ki vah bhaajapa ke paksh main vot degi
 Although this did not affect the Modi government, but Shiv Sena gave a blow to bjp's efforts to keep the NDA united
 agar usne bhaajapa ke paksh main vot diya hota to use hasil 325 vot or zyada ho sakate the
 Taking lessons from the Shiv Sena's stance, the BJP president had to ask the BJP workers in Mumbai the next day to prepare to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha and Maharashtra assembly elections on their own
 vahiin monsoon satr se pehle tak bhaajapa yah daawa kar rahi thi ki 2019 kaa chunaav endie ke sabhi maujuuda saathi mil kar ladenge
 But now the party has realized the danger that Shiv Sena is no longer a trusted partner
 bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, "avishvaas prastaav par charchaa ke dauraan shivasena kii anupasthiti ko yadi chhod bhi den to uddhav thakare kaa yah kahana kaaphi gambhir he ki unke hindutv kii soch bhaajapa ke hindutv kii paribhaasha se alag he
 Actually, Thackeray wants to break the united Hindu vote by making this statement

 "the setback from the Shiv Sena is also significant because some NDA allies have been giving anti-gahe-bahega anti-coalition statements

 "through this statement, Rahul Gandhi brought the" liberal "BJP versus the" liberal "hindutva of the Congress into the discussion
 bhaajapa ko chintaa yah he ki kahin is dibet se "ekajute hindu vot'' bant na jaae
 Especially given the increasing incidents of harassment and mob lynching against Dalits, the apprehension of a "united Hindu vote" has increased

 loksabhaa chunaav se kuch maheene pehle sarkaar kii bedaag chhavi par andeh ke aadhaar par yah charchaa ghaatak ho sakati he
 According to BJP sources, Amit Shah is conscious that there should be no negative atmosphere about the image of the government
 unhone party padaadhikariyon se tathy or aankadon ke saath sarkaar kii saaf-suthri chhavi pesh ko karne kaha he
 a senior BJP leader says, "our strategy for 2019 is very clear that we will go only with the talk of development and corruption-free government
" ham bataaenge ki sarkaar kisaanon, yuvaaon or mahilaon, pichde or anusuchit jati or janajati ke liye kitni yojanaon par kaam kar rahi he
 "on the other hand, the Opposition is repeatedly reiterating that the growth of the BJP includes corporate promotion and common man's plight
" vahiin bhaajapa mahasachiv kailash vijayawargeey kehete hai, "vipaksh kitni bhi koshish kar le, 2019 kaa chunaav vikaas ke mudde par hi hoga
 Despite this claim by the BJP, opportunities for discussion of development have been largely limited
 kisaanon-garibon kii badahaali, berogari or sarkari yojanaon kii jagah mob linching, mahila utpeeda, ugr hindutv, belgaum gorakshak, tarkwaadiyon kii hatya jaise mudde logon ke bich charchaa main hai
 As Congress leader in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge said, "BJP leaders say that they have done a lot for the farmers whereas cases of farmer suicides have increased over the years
 unhone sirf adani or ambani kii baat kii he, kisaanon kii nahin
 "the strategy ahead is clear, given the kind of circumstances that have arisen after the motion of no confidence and other issues have come up for discussion, the BJP has also started changing its strategy
" party ne sahyogiyon ko saadhe rakhane kii apni puraani niti ko lacheela banane kaa faisla kiya he
 According to sources, the bjp's new strategy involves preparing to contest the next elections on its own in states other than Punjab, even in states where it has a government with allies
 vahaan kisi vajah se yadi chunaav ke dauraan gathbandhan main daraar aati he to bhaajapa akele chunaav ladgaye kaa faisla legi
 At the same time, BJP leaders have been asked to keep regular contact with leaders of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Vishwa Hindu Parishad to prevent a split in the Hindu vote
 party ke ek netaa kehete hai, "samaan vichaardhaara vaale sanghathanon ke sahyog se ham hindu vot ko bantane nahin denge
 President Amit Shah will share a detailed strategy for this in the party's national working committee to be held on August 18-19
