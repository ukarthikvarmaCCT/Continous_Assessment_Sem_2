 Of the 14 Lok Sabha seats in the state, BJP got 12, then Chief Minister Soren's opponents and disgruntled colleagues in the assembly pulled their feet back immediately
 aise maahaul main vidhansabha chunaavon main jane kii musiibat bhala koun mol legaa!ek congressi netaa kehete hai, ''sarkaar girane kaa matlab he ki jharkhand thali main rakhkar bijepi ko saunp dena
 "thus the bjp's unexpected victory has become a reason for the Soren government's disgruntled allies and other rival parties not to step forward
" varanaa ve ab tak gathbandhan sarkaar giraane kii koshish main jute gaye hote
 With this, Hemant Soren of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) has got six more months to restore his credibility

 Big leaders like Babulal Marandi and Sudesh Mahato also reached number three in Dumka and Ranchi respectively

 uske netaa kehete hai, ''yah kaaryakartaaon ko vyast or utsahit rakhane kii ranneeti thi
 If we did not fight, our workers and supporters would leave us and go to other parties

 party ke ek or vidhayak simon marandi baagi ho gaye
 On the other hand, the Congress also lost one of its mlas Chandrasekhar Dubey
 ve mantri pad chhodkar trinmul ke tikat par loksabhaa chunaav lade or haar bhi gaye
 Although JMM, which had won four seats in alliance with Congress and RJD in Lok Sabha elections, managed to win two seats but these elections are considered defeat of Hemant Sarkar
 congress nau siton par ladi thi or argedy ek seat par
 On the other hand, BJP does not want to appear greedy for power
 bijepi netaa arjuna munda kehete hai, ''ham alokapriy sarkaar ko giraane kii koi koshish nahin karenge
 "the total strength of Jharkhand assembly is 82 but due to the resignation of two JMM and one Congress MLA and BJP MLA Laxman Gulia winning the Lok Sabha election from Singhbhum, the number is currently 78
 sorain sarkaar ko abhi 40 vidhayakon kaa samarthan praapt he
 There are 16 of JMM, 12 of Congress, 5 of RJD, 2 of Trinamool and 5 Independents
 isse sarkaar bahumat main he
 Whatever it is, sometimes bad days turn into good and Hemant's face will be really happy

 But the country's Muslim scholars do not consider this matter a matter of debate
 ve kehete hai is tarah kii roak desh ke adhiktar rajyon main he
 Islamic scholar Qazi Nadeem Akhtar explains that with the liberation of the country in 1947, a committee of several Islamic experts, including the then famous Muslim scholars sheikh-ul-hadis Maulana Zakaria Kandhali, Maulana Hussain Ahmed Madani and Maulana Ibrahim, decided It was said that in our country, Muslims will neither eat nor sell cow meat

 Because this has nothing to do with Islam

 Why is Tejaswi being searched? Asked why Tejashwi did not go to Muzaffarpur? Raghuvansh Prasad said in his own style, i ask why you do not find the Prime Minister, whom you have given your valuable vote
 mujffarpur main itane bacchon kii maut ke baad bhi pradhanmantri ab tak nahin aae, bihar kii janata ne narendra modi ko vot diya, aise main janata unhen kyon nahin khojati
 Describing the responsibility of the leader of the opposition, he said that the leader of the opposition has no responsibility in this matter
 raghuvansh prasad ne kaha, maamle par aawaaj buland karnaa vipaksh ke netaa kii jimmedaari he
 He said that we are raising our voice
 bacchon kii maut ke liye koun jimmedaar he, yah khud sochie
 Following this statement by the RJD leader, the RJD MLA disagreed with this statement
 argedy vidhayak bhai virendra ne patrakaron se kaha ki raghuvansh babu bade netaa hai, lekin unhen is tarah kaa bayaan nahin dena chahie
 The poor people of Bihar have the right to win the elections and find all who have lost

 Congress is playing on the front foot on its justice plan under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi, while the issue of employment to youth is also under discussion
 aise main bhaajapa ke saamne rahul gandhi ke top 5 masterstroke kaa jawaab dene kii chunauti he
 Nationalism, strong country, self-employment through Mudra Yojana, strict policy with Pakistan have been big issues for BJP
 iske alaave pichley chunaavon main dhara 370, ram mandir, bhrashtachar ke muddon par bijepi kaaphi aakraamak rahi thi
 Now the Congress' justice plan has increased the challenges
 bijepi ke liye inaki kaat khojna jaruri he
 Rahul Gandhi, while releasing his manifesto last week, mentioned about the five schemes
 bijepi ke liye apane sankalp patr main unka jawaab dena jaruri hoga
 Read what are the 5 big promises of Rahul Gandhi, which is a challenge for BJP to overcome
 
 
 1
 In order to address the 20% poor of the justice plan, the Congress has announced the justice scheme
 iske tahat kareeb 5 karod pariwaron ko 72 hajaar rupee saalaan kii aarthik madad di jaaegi
 The Congress is describing this announcement as historic and is trying to convey its message to every voter
 haalanki, bhaajapa pehle hi kah chuki he ye ek dhokhaa dene vaala vaada he
 BJP is already running the Kisan Samridhi Yojana, under which farmers are being given Rs 6000 annually
 2
 The Modi government has been the target of opposition in the last five years on the issue of employment
 congress ne vaada kiya he ki vah satta main aane ke ek saal ke andar khaali pade 22 lakh sarkari padon ko bharegi
 Apart from this, the youth will be given exemption in start up, no permission will be required in the initial three years
 aise main bhaajapa ke saamne chunauti ye bhi he ki yuva votaron ko saadhane ke liye vah apane sankalp patr main kya laaegi
 3
 alag se kisaan bajatkisaanon kaa mudda har chunaav main garam rahaa he
 While the BJP is talking about Kisan Samridhi Yojana on one hand, Rahul Gandhi has talked about bringing a separate budget for farmers
 iske alaava rahul ne kisaanon ke karj na adaa kar paane kii sthiti main jo criminal offence mana jaataa tha, use wo khatm karenge
 Instead, it will be treated as a civil offense for not paying the loans of farmers
 4
 Focus on Education and Health: The Congress promises that it will make the education budget around 6 percent of the entire budget, besides strengthening educational institutions so that good education can be provided
 iske alaava bhaajapa kii ayushmaan bharat yojana ko khokhla bataate hue congress ne ek aisi yojana laane kaa vaada kiya he jisamen sarkari aspataalon main acchhee suvidha muhaiyaa karai jaaengi
 5
 manaregaa ko phir milegi majbooteegramin votaron ko saadhane ke liye congress ne ek baar phir manaregaa par focus kiya he
 The promise of 150 days of employment to laborers under the MNREGA could be a major masterstroke
 aise main bhartiya janata party in vaadon se apane ghoshnaptr main kaise paar paati he, ye bada sawaal hoga

 Do not join the broken again, converge the knot
 
 - Tej Pratap Yadav (@ tejyadav14) November 22, 2018 What is the meaning of dohe means whole couplet of Rahim is like this "rahiman thread love, don't break it
 
 Do not join the broken again, the connected knot should go, which means that the thread of love should never be broken because if it is broken once it does not join again and if it is joined then the knot is formed
 haalanki, tej pratap ne kuch badlaav ke saath is dohe ko twit kiya
 What is the meaning of this, it is clear from Pratap's post that there is pressure on him to settle the dispute with Aishwarya, but he does not want to continue the relationship
 is post ke jariye tej pratap main spasht kar diya he ki aishwarya ke saath agar vah vivaad sulajhaa bhi lete hai tab bhi donon ke rishte pehle kii tarah madhur nahin ho sakate hai

 The future of political parties is determined by the might of the leaders and if the leaders start leaving the party, then the party's spirits are bound to be affected
 aisa hi kuch in dinon aam aadmi party (aap) ke saath ho rahaa he
 In August 2018, the ruling AAP suffered two setbacks in Delhi when two of its veterans, Ashutosh and Ashish Khaitan, bid them goodbye
 aap netaa pehle bhi party chhodte rahe hai lekin is baar donon netaaon ne vyaktigat kaarnon se party chodi he
 Both have been journalists by profession, but Khaitan is now about to start his new innings as a lawyer
 unhone apane faisle se party ko pehle bhi kai baar avgat karaayaa tha or isi ke chalate april main unhone dilli dialog and deveopment kamishan se istipha dekar janhit ke muddon ko adaalat main uthaane kii manshaa jaahir kii thi
 He told, "I will practice in Delhi High Court at the moment
 ellem karne ke bare main baad main sochaa jayega
 "ashutosh has definitely said to leave the party due to personal reasons, but a section within the party is seeing his departure from the AAP from Rajya Sabha seat
" party kii rajnatik maamalon kii samiti (piesi) ke sadsy 53 varshiya ashutosh janvari main rajyasabha main gupta bandhuon ko bheje jane ke baad se hi anmane the
 After his resignation, the head of the party and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted, "how can we ever accept your resignation
" naa, is janm main to nahin
 Sir, we all love you very much
 ’’ jahir he, party apane str par istipha sweekaar nahin kar rahi he
 aap's chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj told India Today, "both of them have resigned but the party has not approved
 party koshish karegi ki donon waapas aa jaaen
 "but Ashutosh said in response to a written question related to this," i will not return to the party
 ’’isse pehle 29 agast ko ashutosh ne twit kiya, ‘‘patrakarita ke puure kariyar ke dauraan kabhi meri jati yaa sarnem kisi ne nahin poocha par 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main aap kaaryakartaaon se parichay karaane ke dauraan mere sarnem par kaaphi jor diya gaya
 "party sources say that this was done to garner caste votes because his caste voters in his constituency are enough
" ashutosh ke is bayaan ko aap par hamalaa mana gaya par unhone twit ko galat samajhe jane ke saath hi khud ko party anushaasan se mukt bataaya
 The list of promoters on the party's website also includes the names of Kumar Vishwas along with Khaitan and Ashutosh
 lekin vishwaas kii party se duuri itani bad chuki he ki uskaa khatm hona ab naammumkin lagata he
 Earlier, Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav had parted ways with the party to challenge the leadership of Arvind Kejriwal, an ally of the Anna movement
 aap kii raajnneeti par najar rakhane vaale rajnatik vishleshak abhaya kumaar dube kehete hai, ‘‘pehle jo netaa gaye ve ladakar gaye, party par kabja or niyantran kaa jhagada uski vajah thi
 But the case of these two is linked for personal reasons
 ’’ dube ke mutabik, yah kayaas he ki ashutosh ne rajyasabha tikat kii vajah se party chodi he
 The party is also facing factionalism in Punjab, the second largest AAP stronghold after Delhi
 punjab vidhansabha main mukhya vipakshi party aap main sukhpal singh khera ke netritv main baagi vidhayakon kaa gut sakriy he
 However, Leader of Opposition in the House Harpal Cheema told India Today, "they asked for time, we gave them time, they spoke on our issue in the assembly
" baatcheet chal rahi he
 Differences will be resolved soon
 ’’ aap ke liye punjab ke saansadon-vidhayakon ko niyantran main rakhana hameshaa se chunauteepurn rahaa he
 As far as Delhi is concerned, AAP seems to be ahead of its rival parties in terms of the strength of the organization and the organization, but as long as its leaders are united

 Kumar Vishwas has a comment on this, "didi you not even accept such an Indian debate?" You used to say - 'I Dare'? " Kejriwal also retweeted it
 kejariwal ne AAP samarthak lekhika chanchal sharma kii ek post ko bhi ritvit kiya he
 In which there is a video of the TV show that aired yesterday, Kiran Bedi got angry and left in the middle
 kumaar vishwaas ne kiran bedi ke 22 june 2012 ke ek twit kaa screen shot bhi post kiya he jisamen kiran ne raashtrapati chunaav ke dauraan ummidavaar pie sangama dwaara pranab mukherjee ko bahes kii chunauti dene kaa zikr kiya he
 In a poetic way, Kumar Vishwas makes an emotional comment on this, "you remember me, don't you remember?" The challenge of putting Kiran in the dock is now in front of Aam Aadmi Party leader Kejriwal to put the same person in the box Sometimes he himself offered to become the Chief Ministerial candidate of Delhi (as the news had come)
 kejariwal khud anna andolan kii upaj hai or ab unhen usee shaks ko galat sabit karnaa he jo kabhi unke agenda or muhim main majboot ke saath data rahaa
 After all, Kejriwal cannot question Kiran Bedi's ability
 kejariwal, kiran bedi kii eemaandaaree par ungali to uthaa nahin sakate
 Kejriwal cannot even question Kiran's intention against corruption
 kya modi kii insurance policy hai kiran bedi?aam aadmi party ke master stritegist yogendra yadav ne ek intervyuu main kiran bedi ko modi kii “insurance policy” bataaya he
 Yogendra Yadav also gives the reasoning behind this, "if BJP loses, it will be put in Kiran's account
 ” yadav kaa kahana he ki bijepi ko kiran bedi kii shakhsiyat or kaabiliyat se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Kejriwal has also described Kiran Bedi as a scapegoat for the BJP
 kejariwal poochhate hai, “kiran bediji aap raajnneeti main kyon ain? aakhir aapane chakravyuuh main funsane kaa faisla kyon kiya, samaj main nahin aa rahaa
 "yadav also questions Kiran Bedi," If she wanted to work with Modi, why did she join the party 20 days before the election? "what will be the strategy ahead? Kejriwal calls Congress against Kiran Bedi Leaving S
 ke
 Bagga has been fielded
 kejariwal ne shila deekshit or narendra modi ko sidhi chunauti di, lekin ve kiran bedi ke saamne nahin aa rahe hai
 The strategy seems to be that only Yogendra Yadav and Kumar Vishwas will take charge against Kiran Bedi
 kejariwal sidhe hamalon se parhez karenge
 Overall, the aim is to prove that Kiran Bedi is a miss-fit in the BJP
 dilli ke teenon nagar nigam ke agle vittiya varsh ke liye bajet anumaanon main house tex main badhotaree kii baat kahi gai he
 Apart from this, it has also been proposed to levy cess and betterment tax on house tax
 nagar nigamon ke is prapojal se dilli ke aradblue association naaraaz hai
 Their objection is that when the house tax is already being taken, then why has it been said that there will be additional cess and more tax on it
 model toun aradblue ke adhyaksh sanjay gupta kehete hai ki yah janata kii ankhon main dhul jhonkne kaa kaam he
 Every year the MCD seeks an excuse to levy tax, while development works have been done in Delhi with little to no
 nigamon main koun se nae tex lagaae jane prastaavit hai?uttari dilli nagar nigam main agle varsh ke liye bajet anumaanon main 1-2 percent house tex badhaane kaa prapojal diya gaya he
 Apart from this, it has been said to impose one percent education cess
 vahiin, commercial property par 15-20 pratishat kiye jane kaa prapojal bhi diya gaya he
 The proposal to impose a 20% cess on house tax in the East Delhi Municipal Corporation is given for the budget of the next financial year
 jabaki dakshini dilli nagar nigam main ek se do pratishat house tex badhaane kaa prapojal diya he, padhai ke liye ek percent ajukeshan ses lagane kii bhi baat kahi gai he
 At the same time, tax on commercial property has been proposed to be increased from 15 to 20 percent
 iske alaava teenon hi nagar nigam ab profeshnal tex bhi lengi
 Income from new taxes will increase- MCD Actually, all the three corporations behind it say that this will increase their income and they will get more funds to develop around the property
 lekin sawaal yah he ki phir house tex kaa auchity hi kya he
 Because house tax is charged for this work
 vipaksh hua naaraaz!uttari dilli nagar nigam main congress parshad dal ke netaa mukesh goyal kehete hai ki bijepi ko apana bhrashtachar nahin dikhataa he or yahi vajah he ki har saal nae tex lagane kii koshish hoti he
 But we will oppose it this year as well
 vahiin, emsidi main kabiz bijepi kaa kahana he ki yah to prapojal he
 Our stand is the same as in previous years

 ajtak unhone matganana main itani dhaandhlee nahin dekhi
 Earlier, eight BJP mlas and SP candidate Jaya Bachchan won easily

 Raja Bhaiyya's suspense was kept between Raja Bhaiya and said that i will go to vote

 After this, Independent mlas Raja Bhaiya and Vinod Saroj cast their votes

 Rajya Sabha Elections: Yogi tightened his win by winning, SP only knows how to take, did not give good figures According to the mathematicians, many times a new strategy was formed during voting
 bich main baat chali ki raja bhaiya ab vot nahin daalenge
 Actually Raja Bhaiya has cast his vote for Samajwadi Party and is about to cast his vote as 37th voter
 lekin ab ek ummidavaar ko jeet ke liye 36 vot hi chahie
 In such a situation, some percentage of Raja Bhaiya's vote in 37 can go to BSP
 isiilie mana ja rahaa tha ki raja bhaiya vot nahin daalenge
 At the same time, according to sources, BJP had made a big strategy for Rajya Sabha
 voton ke ganit ke anusaar bijepi do vidhayakon kaa vot nahin dalavaaegi
 In such a situation, now 36 votes will be required for the selection of Rajya Sabha member
 matlab upi main kul 398 vot hi padenge
 Although 400 votes were cast
 do vidhayakon ke vot daalane par lagi thi rokchunaav shuru hone se pehle hi hoicourt ne duusare maamle main bhi mukhtaar ansaari ke vot daalane par roak laga di thi
 Earlier, he received permission from the lower court to cast his vote in the Rajya Sabha elections held on Friday

 uttar pradesh ke up mukhyamantri keshav prasad maurya ne bijepi ke 9 ummidavaaron ke rajyasabha chunaav main jeetne kaa daawa kiya he
 At the time of elections, Keshav Prasad Maurya said that all our candidates will win
 upmukhyamantri keshav prasad maury kaha tha ki koi antaratma kii aawaaj par vot kare to uskaa swaagat
 In such a situation, cross voting was considered to be fixed

 BJP leaders Siddharth Nath Singh and Shrikant Sharma said that opposition is implicated in UP Rajya Sabha elections
 hamaare sabhi 9 ummidavaar jeetenge or awwal number par rahenge
 Amid speculation of cross voting in the state for the Rajya Sabha elections, SP leader Shivpal Yadav had said that no Samajwadi Party MLA will break
 vahiin duusari ore bijepi netaa shrikant sharma ne kaha ki bijepi ke sabhi 9 ummidavaar jeetenge
 Although SP leader Ram Gopal Yadav also said that there will be no cross voting, but BJP mlas will vote in our favor
 haalanki is chunaav main bijepi ke kai sadasyon ke pahunchane ke baad bhi rajyasabha main bijepi bahumat se dur hi rahegi 
 At the same time, the power of the Congress is likely to decline
 16 rajyon kii kul 58 siton par shuukravaar ko rajyasabha chunaav hue
 Voting was going on in 25 of the 58 seats on Friday
 baaki 33 siton par ek hi ummidavaar hone ke kaaran unka nirvachan 15 march ko hi ho gaya tha
 Shivpal had a claim- Before the election starts, Samajwadi Party leader Shivpal Yadav claimed to win both seats
 unhone kaha tha ki agar cross voting hoti he, to bijepi kii taraf se bhi cross voting ho sakati he
 He said that all our parties have connections with mlas
 yah jarur he ki 2 vidhayak hamase milane aae the, lekin main samaajawaadee party ke vidhayakon ke bare main kah saktaa hum ki koi nahin tuutegaa
 Even before the election, the BSP received a big news from Uttar Pradesh before the blowout
 basapa vidhayak anil singh ne guuruuvaar ko bijepi vidhayakon se mulaakaat kii thi
 Apart from Anil Singh, two more BSP mlas were in touch with BJP
 mukhyamantri awaas par hui vidhayak dal kii baithak main anil singh ko bhi dekha gaya tha
 In such a situation, there was an apprehension that there may be cross voting in the elections

 Tendulkar said, 'selection should not be associated with just looking at the scorebook
 chayankarta aise khilaadiyon ko chun saktaa he, jisane kaaphi adhik ran banaae ho lekin yah kaam nahin karegaa
 i have seen players who were unmatched domestically, but did not perform as well internationally
 ’unhone kaha, ‘chayan ke samay khilaadiyon kaa akalan karnaa hota he
 Even if he fails in some matches, it still needs to be seen whether he has the ability to withstand pressure and whether he can perform in international cricket
 ’tendulkar ne kaha ki aalochana kaa saamana karne vaale tii-20 formet sahit cricket main aae anya badlaavon ne khel ko or adhik romaanchak bana diya he or test maichon main adhik nattejey hasil karne main safalataa mili he

 According to Tendulkar, "there is artistry in it and more results are being achieved now

 When it comes to Test cricket, you have to adjust and no two players are the same in terms of technique

 You can't just block every ball like i used to do in Test cricket
 ’ dravid ne kaha, ‘achche khilaadi saamanjasy baithaana sikhte hai
 If we look at Chris Gayle, Michael Hussey or AB de Villiers in the last IPL, all of them are very good test players
 isliye hamen apane basics sahi rakhane honge
 Tendulkar said that in Test cricket it is more important to focus on basics than in T20

 On Monday, a rally was held for the Patel or Patidar reservation movement in Gujarat's capital Gandhinagar
 asi hi raily, uttar gujarat ke sabarkantha jile ke himmatnagar main bhi hui
 The rally was peaceful but it has created a stir in the politics of Gujarat
 patel samaaj maang kar rahaa he ki unhen bhi anya pichde virgon (obisi) main samavisht kiya jaae or aarakshan kaa laabh diya jaae
 The movement started about a month ago from Mahesana district of Gujarat, from where Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel also come
 mahesena ke saath yah andolan ab lagbhag gujarat ke sabhi jilon main pasar chukaa he or sattadhari bhaajapa ko pareshaan kar rahaa he
 Significantly, the Patel community in Gujarat has been considered a supporter of the BJP for the last several years
 san 1985 main congress ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri madhavsingh solanki ne ek nayaa prayog kiya tha, jise 'khaam' ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Kham means Kshatriya, Dalit, Adivasi and Muslim
 tab obisi aarakshan ko lekan patelon or anya pichde varg ke bich kaaphi hinsa hui thi
 Patel has since been considered angry with the Congress
 shaayad yahi kaaran he ki aaj gujarat main bhaajapa par puri tarah se patelon kaa prabhutv mana jaataa he
 It is evident from this that both Chief Minister Anandiben Patel and party president RC Faldu are Patel leaders
 isi kaaran bhaajapa is andolan se sakate main he or andolan ko duusari ore modane kii koshish main juty he
 The comments rajkot main kendriya mantri or bhaajapa ke gujarat ke netaa mohan kundaria ne aarope lagaaya ki yah andolan congress dwaara prerit he
 The way this movement is spreading rapidly across the state, the BJP is worried
 gujarat main mahanagar palika or nagar palika ke chunaav oktober main hone hai
 In such a situation, if there will be resentment in the bjp's base, then it may have to bear the brunt of it in the elections
 yahi karaan he ki yah puraa maamla rajnatik taur par samvedansheel mana ja rahaa he
 Chief Minister Anandiben Patel is silent on this despite the ever increasing movement
 sirf bhaajapa hi nahin, congress bhi is mudde par maun saadhe he, kyonki is mudde par koi bhi rajnatik bayaan phaayde se zyada nuksaan kar saktaa he
 It remains to be seen whether this movement has any influence in the upcoming local bodies elections and how far this movement goes
 yah andolan gujarat ke mahesena jile se kareeb ek maah pehle shuru hua, jahaan se pradhanmantri narendra modi or gujarat kii mukhyamantri anandiben patel bhi aati hai
 This movement with Mahesana has now spread to almost all the districts of Gujarat and is troubling the ruling BJP
 gauratlab he ki gujarat main patel samudaay pichley kai saalon se bhaajapa kaa samarthak mana jaataa he
 In 1985, Madhav Singh Solanki, the then Chief Minister of Congress, did a new experiment, which is known as 'kham'
 khaam yani kshatriya, dalit, adivasee or muslim
 Then the OBC reservation, but there was a lot of violence between the Patels and other backward classes
 patel tabhi se congress se naaraaz maane jate hai
 Perhaps this is the reason why the BJP is considered to be completely dominated by the Patels in Gujarat today
 yah baat isi se jaahir hoti he ki mukhyamantri anandiben patel or party adhyaksh aar si phaldu donon hi patel netaa hai
 That is why BJP is in awe of this movement and is trying to turn the movement to the other side
 tippaniyan Union Minister in Rajkot and bjp's Gujarat leader Mohan Kundaria alleged that the movement was inspired by the Congress
 jis tarah se yah andolan teji se puure rajya main pasar rahaa he, usase bhaajapa chintaa main he
 Elections for the Municipal Corporation and Municipality in Gujarat are to be held in October
 aise main agar bhaajapa ke janaadhar main naaraazgi aegi to chunaav main use iskaa khamiyaja bhugatna pad saktaa he
 This is the reason that this whole matter is being considered politically sensitive
 lagaataar tej ho rahe andolan ke baavjood mukhyamantri anandiben patel is par maun saadhe hai
 Not only BJP, Congress is also silent on this issue, because any political statement on this issue can do more harm than good
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki aane vaale sthaneey nikaayon ke chunaavon main is andolan kaa koi prabhaav padataa he yaa nahin or yah andolan or kitna aage tak jaataa he

 On the 8th of August, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik was at an investors' conference in Mumbai to strengthen the foundation of the Make in Odisha Conclave
 usee din der shaam ko unhen rajyasabha ke upasabhapati ke chunaav main endie ummidavaar harivansh nayaran singh ke samarthan ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa phone aayaa
 Patnaik agreed to support Harivansh and came to Bhubaneswar and announced his support to Harivansh around 9 pm
 sutron kii maane to agle din chunaav jeetne ke baad phir pradhanmantri phone karke patnayak ko aabhaar jataate hue kehete hai, ''abhaari hum or aage bhi abhaari rahoonga
 "new implications are being extracted in Odisha's political strata
 ek ore jahaan rashtriya raajnneeti ke falak par bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ko baari raahat milti najar aa rahi he, vahiin duusari ore rajya main vah uhapoh main he
 However, this is not the first time Biju Janata Dal (BJD) chief Patnaik, an old BJP ally, has given relief to the Narendra Modi government
 monasutra ke dauraan hi do aise maukey dekhne ko mili
 Earlier, during the no-confidence motion, the BJD had indirectly helped the NDA instead of voting against the Modi government
 ab upasabhapati ke chunaav main apane 9 sadasyon kaa vot endie ummidavaar ko dilaa kar unhone is siyaasi charchaa kii raah khol di he ki 2019 ke loksabhaa or odisha vidhansabha chunaav tak donon saath aa sakate hai
 Or the post-election BJD may be part of the NDA
 darasal upasabhapati ke chunaav main satta paksh or vipaksh ke bich kaante kaa takkar tha
 Both the NDA and UPA were eyeing the BJD vote
 kayaas lagane lage ki patnayak khud apana pratyaashee utaar sakate hai yaa phir ain chunaav ke vakt vakout kar jaaenge
 Or, sensing the current state of the country and the electoral winds in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the BJD decides to go with the UPA
 rajyasabha main bhaajapa or uske sahyogiyon kii sankhya congress tathaa uske sahyogiyon kii sankhya main zyada antar nahin tha
 BJP veterans were upset
 janata dal (you) ke harivansh ko endie kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiye jane ke baad bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah or kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh lagaataar phone ke jariye patnayak ke sampark main the
 Patnaik, known for his minimal world, maximum work, kept answering him by saying just this one line, "yes, let's see
" '' in donon netaaon ne phir narendra modi ko report di
 And finally Patnaik agreed after Modi's call
 lekin modi sarkaar ke paksh main bijd ke khadey ho jane se bhaajapa kaa odisha main cheharaa kahe jane vaale kendriya petroleum mantri dharmendra pradhan kii sthiti asahaj ho gai he
 The dilemma faced by the pramukh, who is aggressively describing the 18 years of the BJD government in the state as a failure, is to continue his aggressive stand or to remain silent
 bhaajapa kii rajya ikai or uske kaaryakartaaon ke saamne siyaasi dharmsankat khadaa ho gaya he ki agar kendriya netritv, bijd se haath mila letaa he to phir rajya main party kitni bhi aakraamak ho jaae janata main galat sandesh galat jayega
 "how to ask for votes during elections in such a situation," says a senior worker sitting in a party office in Bhubaneswar from the withers
 ''varsh 2000 se 2009 tak galabahiyaan daalkar raajnneeti karne vaali bijd or bhaajapa odisha main bhale hi ek duusare ke kattar dushman kii tarah dikhaai dete rahe hon, modi or shah manchon se patnayak tathaa unki party ko pani pi-pikar koste rahe hon, lekin dilli main donon hi dalon kii jugalbandi jagajaahir he
 Opportunities Standing in favor of the NDA, Patnaik has clearly indicated the role of the BJD in the 2019 general election
 aise main agar loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle yaa baad main bijd agar endie ke paksh main chali jaae to yah koi hairaani kii baat nahin hogi
 The BJD formed a joint government with the BJP twice in the years 2000 and 2004
 baad main 2008 main kandhamal main vishwa hindu parishad ke prachaarak lakshmananand saraswati kii hatya ke baad donon main khatas aane lagi
 Due to interference of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), their friendship turned into enmity
 uske baad 2009 se bijd chunavi maidan main badhat leti rahi
 Even Odisha remained untouched by the Modi wave in 2014
 haalanki centre main modi ke netritv main sarkaar banane ke baad bijd centre ke prati naram hua
 The BJD emerged as the single largest party by securing 20 Lok Sabha seats out of 21 in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and 117 assembly seats in 147 of the assembly elections, but Patnaik left no stone unturned to maintain a cordial relationship with the Center
 mins and miniral deveopment regulation act main sanshodhan se upie sarkaar dwaara aavantit khanan block nirast karne ke faisle main bijd ne centre kaa saath diya, jabaki isse miniral mins main centre kaa hastkshep main badha
 The lease of 37 blocks of Odisha was canceled
 rajyasabha main vibhinn vidheyakon ko paas karaane main bhi bijd ne modi sarkaar kaa saath diya
 Not only this, Patnaik praised the surgical strike and by openly supporting the GST, he emerged as a nationally reformist personality in the eyes of the central government
 raashtrapati ke nirvachan main bhi bijd ne vip jari karke endie ke ummidavaar ramnath kovind ko jeet dilaane main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi
 However, the argument being made about Harivansh's support for the post of Deputy Chairman is that the Janata Dal (U) leader Jayaprakash Narayan is the product of the movement and the political roots of both parties are linked
 lekin varisht patrkaar or siyaasi vishleshak ravidaas kehete hai, ''rajya main bhaajapa patnayak sarkaar ke prati aakraamak rahati he, par centre main kuch or hi najar aata he
 This could be a strategy to gain support in the 2019 general election
 '' haal hi main patnayak ne assam main rashtriya naagarikta (enarasi) ke mudde kii bhi tarif kii he
 In such a situation, Tara Prasad Bahinipati, the chief whip of the Congress Legislature Party, asks, "where did Patnaik's statement to maintain equal distance between Congress and BJP go now?" Why did the accusers become silent? Where has the new mantra of keeping the same distance gone? "however, BJD spokesperson and Cooperative and Civil Supplies Minister Suryanarayana Patra says," Our leaders are maintaining the same distance statement from both the parties, and the alliance with BJP So there is no question
 '' lekin kathani or kerani kaa fark saarvajinak rup se najar aane laga he
 Anyway, there is no permanent enemy or friend in politics

 There are about one crore people in America, who are living with spending of two dollars a day
 unka jivan food stamp, saamaajik kalyaan or sarkari skulon dwaara die jane vaale muft bhojan or sahaayta ke sahare chalata he
 This was said by researcher Lawrence Chandy of Brookings Institution
 samachar agency effe ke mutabik chandi ne kaha, 'dhan kii arthvyavastha se baahar rah rahe logon kaa jivan kaaphi badahaal he
 They are sometimes caught by illness or death
 'chandi ne garibon par prakashit apane adhyayan main kaha ki america main 4
 60 million people are living below the poverty line of $ 16 per day and 20 million people are living at eight dollars per day
 chandi ke mutabik is tabake kii khaas baat yah he ki ye log naganya aay par sirf saamaajik kalyaan ke bharose ji rahe hai
 Chandy said in his study that the main focus of leaders in America remains on the middle class
 isse is dharna ko bal miltaa he ki garibon kii sankhya kam or asthaayee he or mehnat karne vaale dhire-dhire samrudh ho jaaenge, lekin unke mutabik sachai yah he ki pichhali aadhi sadi main garibi se amiri kaa safar kaaphi dhimaa rahaa he
 Reliance jiofiber has been announced
 jiofiber ke tamaam plan bhi aa chuke hai
 There are plans ranging from Rs 699 to Rs 8,499
 agar aap Netflix, Hotstar yaa duusare contant eps ke shaukeen hai or jyadatar vakt in par filmein or siries dekhte hai to jiofiber ke kuch plan aapke laayak nahin hai
 jiofiber does not have a single broadband plan in which FUP is not given
 sabhi plance main FUP (fair Usage Policy) hai
 That is, you can use high speed data up to a limit
 halanki aisa nahin he ki data khatm hone ke baad aapkaa internet band ho jayega
 Because after the data runs out, you will continue to get 1mbps speed
 jiofiber broadband ke plan main shuruaati speed 100mbps he
 These speeds range from Netflix or Hotstar to other content apps
 lekin 1mbps kii speed jo aapako data khatm hone ke baad milegi wo kaaphi nahin he
 Keep in mind, the prices of all plans are without GST
 GST alag se he
 699 rupees plan is not enough for you, now talk about 699 rupees plan
 is plan main aapako 100mbps kii speed to milegi, lekin iske saath aapako sirf 100GB kaa data milegaa
 However, as an initial operation, you will get 50GB extra data for six months
 kul mila kar aapako 150GB data mil rahaa he
 Its validity is 1 month
 Netflix par agar aap har din kam se kam ek film dekhte hai, utyub par videos dekhte hai, internet browjing karte hai
 So 150GB of data will not run for a month
 agar aapke ghar main TV he or is par Netflix dekhte hai
 Average keep 1 film every day, yet the plan of Rs 699 is not for you
 Netflix par aap standard definishan (SD) ek ghante contant dekhte hai to 1GB data lagata he
 On the other hand, if you watch HD, 3GB of data is used in an hour
 har din ek film kaa aivarej 2 ghante rakh len
 In addition to film, keep 2GB data in video and browsing
 yani kul mila kar ek din main aap 8 se 10GB data kharch kar rahe hai
 In 30 days you will use 300GB data, but in the plan of Rs 699, you get 150GB of data
 wo bhi kuch maheenon ke baad 100GB ho jayega
 So this plan is not for you
 agar aap basic Netflix yujar bhi hai, phir bhi ye plan aapke liye nahin he
 Is 849 plan enough? Now let's talk about 849 rupees plan
 is plan main 200GB data miltaa he
 For the first few months you will get 200GB of extra data
 yani total 400GB data aapako milegaa
 If you are an average Netflix or other video app user, then the data given under this plan will fall short for you
 Netflix dwaara khapat kiye jane vaale data ke bare main hamane upar bataaya he
 If you use Netlfix or any other content apps on 4K TV then 7GB of data will be consumed in 1 hour
 iske alaava internet browjing, utyub video or gaming se lagbhag 3 se 4GB data kii khapat karenge
 That is, if you are consuming 10GB to 15GB of data every day, then in the month you will need at least 450GB of data which is not available in this plan
 isliye ye bhi plan aapke liye kaaphi nahin hoga
 Rs 1,299 plan: Under this plan you will get 200mpbs speed
 data limit kii baat karen to yahaan aapako 500GB data milegaa
 250GB data extras will be available under the initial offer
 yani total aapako 750GB data mil rahaa he
 This plan is for you
 kyonki aivarej yujar hai to aapke liye ek maheene main 750GB data thik he
 But there are many people in your house, watching series every day on Netflix, finishing the series with 10 episodes on weekends
 aise main ye bhi plan aapke liye nahin he
 You have to look at the plan of Rs 2,499, in which 2500GB data is given
 jiofiber ke tamaam plan ko dekh kar aisa lagata he ki company ko kam se kam ek yaa do plan aise rakhane chahie the jisamen koi FUP na ho
 There are many broadband companies that offer plans without FUP and their packs are also aggressively priced
 bhale hi har company aapako 100mbps speed na de, lekin Netlfilx jaise contant eps – 10mbps se upar ke plan main kaaphi behtareen chalate hai or aaj kal companiyaan 50 Mbps vaale plan khub de rahi hai
 Swine flu has spread the paws of death on almost half the country
 dekhte hi dekhte isliye ki kagaji karrwai or 'bharosa rakhie' jaise bayanon ke alaavajamini str par ise rokane ke liekoi bhi sarkaar pukhta kadam uthaati nahin dikh rahi he
 Especially when the Health Ministry says that no state has asked for any help from it yet
 yah sab aise samay he, jab maut kaa kaaravaan 663 logon tak pahunch chukaa he or 10 hajaar se zyada log is beemaari se jujh rahe hai
 It should be about Rajasthan or Gujarat
 madhya pradesh kii yaa jammu-kashmir se lekar himachal kii
 There is chaos in hospitals everywhere, and long queues at the drugstores
 lekin isse bhi bada durbhaagya yah ki kabhi america ko apni mehmaan navaji se rijhaane vaale is desh main apano ke liye jaruri swasthya suvidha hi nahin he
 However, now that the disease has taken a gigantic form, the Central Government has also woken up
 kendriya swasthya mantri jepi nadda ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki desh main temiflu kii dawa kii kami nahin he
 According to the latest figures, the number of people who lost their lives due to swine flu across the country has increased to 663, while the number of people affected by it has crossed 10,000
 is bich is rog ne nagaland jaise rajyon tak main apane paanv pasaar die hai
 Statistics indicate that there is no reduction in the number of people affected by this virus, as 39 more people died between 16-17 February
 sarkaar kii 'biimaar vaani'duusari ore, kendriya swasthya mantri jagat prakaash nadda ne kaha he ki dawaaon kii koi killat nahin he or aspataal swine flu se nipatane main sakasham hai
 But what the ministry said in its statement further is shocking
 mantralay ne kaha ki rajyon kii taraf se dawa, pareekshan kits yaa anya aavashyak samaan ko lekar koi maang nahin ai he
 That is, if it is so, then how serious are the state governments in this regard, it can be estimated
 centre sarkaar ke mutabik, is saal abhi tak ech1en1 virus se 10025 log prabhavit hue hai
 Forgetting help, there are some discrepancies in the data coming from the government center and the states getting entangled in the data
 masalan, centre sarkaar ke aankadon se pataa chalata he ki is saal jammu-kashmir main is virus se prabhavit hone vaale logon kii sankhya mahaj teen he, jabaki rajya ke ek varisht swasthya adhikari ne kaha ki kam se ek ek vyakti kii jaan gai he or 70 logon main is rog kii pushti hui he
 Shaukat Zargar, director of sher-e-kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences in Srinagar, said, "so far two patients suffering from H1N1 virus have been killed and 71 others have confirmed the virus
 ' unhone kaha ki ek vyakti kii maut kii pushti isi virus ke kaaran hui he, jabaki ek anya mahila rogi ko hriday sambandhi gambhir rog bhi tha or uski in rogon ke kaaran mrityu hui
 The first such case was also confirmed in Nagaland
 vahaan ek mahila main yah virus paaya gaya he
 The worst affected states due to swine flu are Rajasthan and Gujarat, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, where 183, 155 and 90 people have died due to this disease
 yah teenon rajya bijepi shasit he
 BJP means power at the center and Modi government
 punjab main abhi tak is beemaari se 24, jabaki padosi rajya haryana main 17 jaane ja chuki hai
 Six people have died in UP, while the number of positive cases has increased to 114
 is bich aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay ke adhikariyon ne kaha ki vishvavidhyalay se jude logon main aath maamalon kii pushti hui he
 This justified the suspension of all classes and educational activities on the campus until 25 February
 abhi adhyayan karwaanaa chaahati he sarkaraswasthya mantralay ne akhil bhartiya ayurvigyaan chikitsa santhaan (ames) main ek nai pareekshan suvidha shuru kii he
 Also, a 24-hour surveillance cell is running in the National Medical Control Center
 mantralay ne apane bayaan main buudhvaar ko kaha, 'swasthya mantralay ke visheshgy dalon ne telugana, gujarat or rajasthan rajyon kaa daura kiya he or unhen takneekee sahaayta di he
 Two such parties were sent to Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra today
 ' swasthya mantralay ne rajyon se kaha he ki aisi mauton ke bare main adhyayan karavaaya jaae, jisamen is par gaur kiya jaae ki kis aayu varg, kin kshetron or kin paristhitiyon main aisi mautein hui
 Delhi also woke up in the meantime, the Delhi government directed all private laboratories not to charge more than Rs 4500 for testing the viral disease
 sarkaar kaa yah kadam vibhinn rogiyon kii in shikayaton ke baad uthaaya gaya ki shahar kii nijee prayogshaalaon main in pareekshanon ke liye manamaana dhan vasuul kiya ja rahaa he
 According to information received from Kolkata, six new cases of swine flu were reported in the state in the last one day, which increased the number of such cases in the state to 42
 pashchim bengal ke swasthya sevaaon ke nideshak vishwaranjan satpati ne kaha ki pichley 24 ghante main kisi kii jaan jane kii koi khabar nahin he
 Two people have died due to this disease in the state since January this year

 In fact, the Anil Ambani Kyrillayanakmunications (rcom) owes Rs 1100 crore to the Ericsson company
 jise lekar neshnal company lau tribunel (NCLT) ne 30 sitambar tak reliance communications (arcom) ko 550 karod arikson ko dene ko kaha tha
 But despite nclt's order, Reliance Communications (rcom) failed to give the fixed amount to Ericsson
 lihaaja arikson ne court se yah bhi maang kii he unke upar nyaayalay kii avmaananaa kaa maamla bhi chalaaya jaae
 Ericsson's petition states that rcom is not respecting the law of the country and takes the order lightly, so it should be banned from outside the country without a court order

 On this, Ericsson also said that the action to declare rcom bankrupt should not be initiated till its dues are received

 Probably for the first time in the history of the country, the Income Tax Department struck a unique red
 ye chapa kabristaan main padaa
 Then when a tomb was dug during the raid, a treasure of 433 crores came out of it
 log kehete hai kabristaan main aane ke baad duniyavi kahani hameshaa hameshaa ke liye khatm ho jaati he
 Humans first corpse
 phir kankal or aakhir main khud hi kahani ban jaataa he
 But the story of Chennai begins with a grave
 kahani insaani jurm kii
 Story of rigging
 kahani insaani laalach kii
 The story that has never been heard or heard before
 khud department ke log is kahani ko sun kar sakate main hai
 The story of the tomb, the mystery of the cemetery is the day of 28 January 2019
 iskar vibhaag ko khabar milti he ki tamilnadu ke mashhoor sarvana store, lotus group or zee scovyar ke maalikon ne haal hi main cash ke jariye chennai main 180 karod kii property kharidi he
 And they are manipulating the tax by hiding this deal
 ye khabar itani pakki thi ki iskar vibhaag ne in companiyon ke chennai or coimbatore main 72 thikaanon par chapa maarane ke liye kai timen taiyaar kin
 And from early morning, the Income Tax Department started raiding the bases of these companies
 magar inakam tex ke adhikariyon ke haath kuch bhi nahin laga
 No money
 naa zevar
 No paper
 6 farvari 2019, chennaikar vibhaag ko yakeen nahin ho rahaa tha ki ye kaise hua ki in teenon companiyon ke maalik ke bare main itani pukhta jaankaree hone ke baavjood unka oparation fail kaise ho gaya
 He felt nothing
 department ko apni impharmeshan par itnaa yakeen tha ki wo khud ko naakaam maanane ke bajaae is baat kii tafsheesh main jute gaye ki unki ye red naakaamayaab kaise rahi
 Informants were activated
 shahar ke saikadon sisitivi check kiye gaye
 Call details were investigated
 tab jaakar pataa chalaa ki ek esayuvi gaadi us rose yani 28 janvari ko puure din sadakon par bevajaah idhar-udhar gum rahi thi
 Seeing the footage, the department became suspicious
 sisitivi kii talash kii gai magar usamen kaaphi vakt laga haalanki agle hi din police ne us esayuvi or uske driver ko giraftaar kar liya
 7 February 2019, morning time, silence on every side of Chennai
 jaisaa ki kabristaan main hota he
 But the sound of sirens ripping this silence
 kyonki khabar milte hi iskar vibhaag kii team subah subah chennai ke ek kabristaan main daakhil hui
 He was accompanied by the driver of the SUV, who was driving his car all day in the city on 28 January
 giraftaar ke baad usase raatbhar kadi poochtacha kii gai thi
 And even at this time he came to the cemetery with the officials of Income Tax Department
 saikadon kabron ke bich us driver ne ek kabr kii taraf ishaara kiya
 On his gesture, the entire department ran towards that grave
 fawda, kudaal or belcha lekar karmchaaree jute gaye
 The tomb was dug in a hurry
 phir jab kabr kii mitti hati or jo tasviir dikhi
 He made the senses of all the Income Tax officials and employees standing there
 iskar vibhaad ke adhikari, karmchaaree or pulisavaale ab us kabr ke saamne khadey the
 In which the treasure was not buried
 puure 433 karod kaa khazaana
 It had around Rs 25 crore cash, 12 kg gold and 626 carat diamonds
 magar sawaal ye tha ki iskar adhikari jis khazaane ko dhughane ke liye 72 thikaanon par chaape maar chuke the
 How did he come to a grave? iskar vibhaag kii red kii khufia jaankaree kisne li kii? to in saare sawaalon ke jawaab us driver ne die jo puure din chennai kii sadakon par kaala dhan lekar bas yun hi gum rahaa tha
 The first time such action was happening in Chennai and Coimbatore was perhaps the first time in the history of this country
 inakam tex department kii is red kii kahani kisi south indian film jaisi thi
 But what happened here was true rather than the story of the film
 driver kii nishandehi par kabr se jab mitti hataai gai to kabr ke andar
 Around Rs 25 crore cash, 12 kg gold and 626 carat diamonds were recovered
 in tamaam chizon kii kul keemat jab iskar vibhaag nikaali to keemat baithi 433 karod rupee
 That is, the entire treasure under this tomb was buried
 433 karod kii keemat kaa khajaana
 The treasury of the Arabs that came out of the tomb was the treasure that the Income Tax Department wanted to search by raiding 72 places on January 28 in Chennai and Coimbatore
 magar is dhaandhlee main shaamil teenon badeen companiyon sarvana store, lotus group or zee scovyar ke maalikon ne ise pehle hi paar kar diya tha
 Apart from the manipulation of money, these people also took away records from the computer with the help of IT experts and after hiding the money in an SUV cart and traveling all day in the city, there was no place to hide it in a grave in a nearby cemetery
 Such hid
 jaise vahaan marane ke baad murde ko rakhaa jaataa he
 So that no one can feel their theft
 esayuvi car main gum rahaa tha khajaanayahi vajah thi ki pukhta khabar hone ke baavjood 28 janvari ko maare gaye inakam tex ke chaape main department ko zyada kuch nahin mila tha
 This is because according to sources, the news of the companies being raided had already been reported to some policemen
 or red padane kii soochna milane ke baad teenon companiyon ke maalikon ne zyaadaatar paison, sona or hiron ko ek esayuvi main chhupaakar chennai kii sadakon par daudana shuru kar diya
 The total value of the goods in this vehicle was close to Rs 433 crore
 driver ne kholaa rajayakar adhikariyon kii is naakaam red ke baad jaanch kii gai to pataa chalaa ki jis vakt department chapa maar rahaa tha
 At the same time, an SUV car was constantly circling the streets of Chennai
 jisamen kaaphi kaala dhan or jevaraat the
 After which this SUV car was searched and finally with the help of police it was also found
 magar police or iskar adhikariyon ko is gaadi main bhi kuch nahin mila
 But when the driver of this car was strictly questioned, he revealed that he hid a lot of sacks in a cemetery containing cash
 zevar or heere hai
 After this, the Income Tax authorities started digging that tomb in the cemetery on the driver's mark
 jisamen khazaana chupaane kii baat driver ne kahi thi
 In the excavation, the Income Tax authorities recovered about Rs 25 crore in cash, 12 kg gold and 626 carat diamonds
 28 janvari ko shuru hua oparation 9 din baad jaakar khatm hua
 After the end of this operation, the Income Tax authorities are currently taking help of IT professionals to retrieve the deleted data from the computer
 taaki in teenon companiyon ke maalikon ne haal hi main cash ke jariye chennai main jo 180 karod kii property kii kharid kii he uskaa khulaasa kiya ja sake

Overall, the Banaras Hindu University is boiling with the anger of not only the existing alumni and students
 prashasan kanoonee raay par is masale kaa hal khojane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 But in the midst of all these questions, another question has arisen whether bribes, brotherhood and acquaintance games are being played openly in university appointments
 There is no doubt that the appointment of Dr
 Feroze Khan cannot be rejected because he is a Muslim, but the investigation should also be that whether the university's merit deal is going on indiscriminately? Some students are not satisfied with the official reply given on the appointment of BHU administration

 aatankwaad ke masale par america ne pakistan ko sakht chetavanee dete hue kaha he ki agar bharat par aage koi aatanki hamalaa hota he to yah uske liye badi musiibat ban saktaa he
 By warning Pakistan, the US has made it clear that it will have to take concrete action against terrorist organizations
 america ne pakistan ko kadaa sandesh dete hue kaha ki khaas-taur par jaish-e mohammad or lashkar-e taiyaba jaise aatanki sanghathanon ke khilaaf pakistan ko pukhta ection lenaa hoga
 a senior White House official in Washington said on Wednesday that Pakistan needs to take stern action against terrorist organizations
 bharat-pakistan kshetra main kisi prakaar kaa tanaav paidaa na ho, iske liye jaruri he ki pakistan khaskar jaish-e mohammad or lashkar-e-taiyaba ke khilaaf sakht kadam uthaae
 America has said that if the situation worsens, it will be dangerous for both the countries
 bataa den ki jaish-e mohammad wo aatanki sanghathan he, jisane pulavama main 14 farvari ko siarpief javaanon ke kafile ko nishaanaa banaaya tha or usamen 40 javaanon kii shahadat hui thi
 After this attack, India airstrike on Pakistan and demolish the terrorist bases there
 pulavama ke doshiyon par karrwai ke liye bharat pakistan ko saboot bhi saunp chukaa he
 The US official also said that Pakistan has taken initial action in the last few days, in which the properties of terrorist organizations have been confiscated and their arrests have been made
 pakistan ne jaish ke kuch pramukh thikaanon ko bhi apane kabje main liya he
 But we want to see a lot more action than this
 america ne pakistan se spasht kaha he ki pehle bhi pakistan kii taraf se giraftaar jaise kadam uthaae gaye hai, lekin baad main in aatankiyon ko chhod diya jaataa he
 Even terror bosses are allowed to roam across the country
 aise main pakistan ko ab ekadam thos karrwai kerani hogi
 When asked about the steps taken by Pakistan after the action of the Indian Air Force in Balakot, the White House authority said that the United States and the international community would like to see concrete and decisive action against terrorist organizations
 adhikari ne kaha, 'abhi pakistan kii ore se uthaae gaye kadamon ko lekar purna akalan karnaa jaldbaaji hogi
 In recent times, Pakistan has taken some initial steps
 masalan, kuch aatanki sanghathanon kii sampattiyaan jabt kii gai hai or kuch kii giraftaar bhi hui hai or jaish ke kuch thikaanon ko prashasan ne apane kabje main liya he
 But apart from these steps, much more needs to be done from Pakistan
 is desh main pichley do dashakon main sex kii paribhaasha main jo badlaav aayaa he, use sidhe-sidhe badhate shaharikaran se joda ja saktaa he
 We have seen that the size of cities is increasing day by day and people are leaving the village and moving towards the cities
 yah badlaav sirf bhautik kshetra main hi nahin ho rahaa he, balki maansik kshetra main bhi ho rahaa he
 Sex Survey 2011: Women are just getting replaced by new ideas instead of old women
 isaki vajah se do alag-alag samaaj banate ja rahe hai
 The new India is fully welcoming the opportunities, freedom and anonymity that urbanization offers
 ham dekh rahe hai ki bangaloru or mumbai alag-alag bhashaaon or samudaayon ke centre banate ja rahe hai
 There is an increasingly consumerist trend of living in the newly affluent sections of big cities, whose income has almost doubled
 lekin kuch aise bhi hai jo paaramparik or saamanti soch ke saath iskaa virodh karte hai
 In a rapidly expanding modern city, they try to maintain their feudal and old values
 yah purana bharat nae bharat ko samaj nahin paa rahaa he
 They are frightened by the sexual chaos of the changing youth and do not miss any opportunity to curb them
 saarvajanik sthanon par aksar unhen kabhi pulicekarmiyon kii shakl main to kabhi kattarpanthi dharmik sanghathanon yaa bhashaayi samoohon ke sadasyon ke rup main un yuvaaon ko utpeedit karte dekha ja saktaa he
 When i was asked to write on the latest sex survey of India Today, i remembered an incident a few weeks back
 main ek coffee house main apane dost kaa intjaar kar rahaa tha ki mujhe apane peeche vaali mej par chal rahi ek baatcheet sunai dinek ladkaa saath main baithi ek ladki se puch rahaa tha, ''kya kah rahi ho, condom tumhaari mummy ke haath lag gaye
 "the girl replied," Stupid, you had left them in my bag
 '' usne bina ghabaraae poocha, ''phir unhone kya kaha
 "the girl laughingly told," Nothing
 
 
 unhen kam-se-kam yah to yakeen he ki main surakshit sex karti hum
 "I turned my head back and became unaware that he was a two-year-old youth studying in college
" unhone meri ore dekha or jor se hans pade
 He did not blush at all, but rather he was enjoying the look of shock on my face
 shaayad main umr main unase dasek saal bada huunga, lekin umr ke is chote se fark main bada badaalav mahasoos karata hum
 The India Today Sex Survey, 2011, takes into consideration the thinking of the older generation
 surveykshan main zyaadaatar aise uttardaata hai jinaki umr 25 saal se zyada he, jinke vivaah (zyaadaatar mata-pita ne tay kiye) ko 20 saal se zyada ho chuke hai or jinke bachche hai
 This means that the survey ignores the sexual behavior of normal and regular families and their thinking about sex
 ek taraf aisa lagata he ki bharat main pichley ek dashak main is maamle main kuch khaas badlaav nahin aayaa he
 About half of the population still consider sex before marriage to be wrong
 purush sex ke nazariye se mahilaon ke mukaable zyada santusht jindagi ji rahe hai
 Women are still more loyal to their male friend, lover or husband
 kareeb 71 fisadi mahilaon ke puure sex jivan main kavval ek hi purush rahaa he jabaki 37 fisadi purushon ke sex jivan main ek se adhik mahilaayein rahi hai
 Urbanization has also played an important role in sexual behavior
 zyaadaatar purushon (55 fisadi) or mahilaon (43 fisadi) kaa maananaa he ki naukari karne vaali mahilaayein vivahetar yaa ek se adhik sahabhaagiyon ke saath sambandhon kii badi vajah hai
 When they were asked about various aspects of their lives, the respondents' reply was that employment, health, social life, money and even emotional life were more satisfying than sex
 pichley dashak main purushon or mahilaon kii patrikaon, chaahe ve swasthya kii hi kyon na hon, main sex jivan par charchaa kii jane lagi or sex par sujhav or vichaar die jane lage
 These magazines are considered particularly popular among teenagers and adults
 unamem pathak ke sex jivan ko chatkhaaredaar banane ke liye yon fantasiyon kii charchaa kii jaati he, kaam kii jaankaree, sujhav or games ke bare main bataaya jaataa he
 Unlike the liberal East, or the 'clean' West, India is very clear in its sex policy
 na ashleelata-na hi bechaari savita bhabhi, na sex kii dukaane or sex ke khilone to bilkul bhi nahin
 Even you cannot bring them from outside to your country
 aap unhen tabhi laa sakate hai jab seemaa shulk adhikariyon ko yah na pataa ho ki ve kya hai or kis kaam ke liye unka istemaal hota he
 Recently, Rajat Kapoor's film, Mixed Doubles, featured wives swapping and a couple joining a special role playing game
 use dekhakar darshakon ko koi aashcharya nahin hua
 This shows that a small part of India's population is urban, he has seen the world, he is not ignorant of such parties
 isiilie bollywood kii film main yah dekhakar use koi hairaani nahin hui
 This survey also shows that working parents have no objection to their children being friends with opposite sex peers
 paramparawaadi shaharon ke ulat bangaloru or mumbai jaise mahanagar sex ke maamle main zyada udaar hai
 Homosexual relationships, one-night companions and unmarried couples living in Bangalore have a greater acceptance than other big cities
 sex survey: tasveeron se jane yuvaaon ke man ke andar kii batarya samaaj ke baavjood vidhwaa vivaah ko ek varg sweekaar nahin karata
 According to the survey, a small but significant portion of the population does not like the remarriage of widowed and divorced women
 is surveykshan se jaahir he ki jis desh main echivi ke maamle bad rahe hai usamen 18 saal se kam umr vaale bacchon ke mata-pita yuvaaon main sex ke prati ruzan se anjaan bane hue hai
 Only one-quarter of respondents believed that their children may engage in sex
 jo log maanate hai ki unke bachche sex main lipt hai, unamem se zyaadaatar use andekha kar dete hai
 About 80 percent of the adult population does not want to talk to their children about sex
 or phir karnataka jaise kuch aise bhi rajya hai, jo skool main sex shiksha kaa virodh karte hai
 Sex Survey 2011: Trap Parents Most people are unaware that India is one of the countries in the world with the highest number of girls getting pregnant at a young age
 lekin isse kisi ko aashcharya nahin he kyonki unamem se zyaadaatar ladkiyaan vivaahit hoti hai, jabaki 'lanpat pashchim' main ise 'kishoron kaa gairjimmedaarana vyavhaar or svachhndatha' mana jaataa he
 According to this survey, whenever parents come to know that their children are indulging in sex, they reprimand them or deliberately shut their eyes
 sirf ek-tihaai mata-pita hi is bare main apane bacchon se baat karte hai or unhen shikshit karte hai
 Most of the respondents are reluctant to express love towards their wife or husband in front of their children
 mata-pita or bacchon ke bich sex ke vishay par simit baatcheet hi hoti he
 Perhaps this is the reason why a large number of teenagers lead double lives and are shocked when parents come to know about their sex life
 saamaajik sampark na hone or sex ke vishay par mata-pita se koi jaankaree na milane se bachche internet kaa sahaara lete hai
 Parents are usually not aware of what children see on the Internet
 nateeja yah hota he ki ve ashleel site dekhne lagate hai
 With the intention of attracting them to the site, sex is offered as a market thing
 unamem antarangta kii bajaae vaasana or tripti par jor diya jaataa he or bachche sex ke bare main pehali raay shaayad unheen se banaate hai
 That is why we often hear news of incidents of sex in children
 sage-sambandhiyon ke saath sex sambandh rakh chuke 25 fisadi uttardaataaon ne bataaya ki unke saath aisa jabaran hua
 Half of them reported that this was their first experience of sex, which would affect their understanding of sex throughout life
 bangaloru main aap 12 yaa 13 saal ke bacchon ko baar yaa disco main dekh sakate hai or unke mata-pita ko pataa hi nahin hota he ki unke bachche kya kar rahe hai
 In India, purity is seen to be associated with marriage, but the behavior of youth in these cities does not seem to give much importance to the institution of marriage
 bangaloru un shaharon main se ek he jahaan sabase zyada uttardaataaon ne mana ki unhone sex ke liye paise die hai
 Twenty percent of respondents feel that repeated sex with the same partner makes one bored
 isi tarah hyderabad or mumbai main uttardaata maanate hai ki vivahetar sambandh rakhane main koi kharabi nahin he
 Most of the results of the survey are not unexpected
 agar koi cheez ham jaanate hai to vah yah ki media or soochna ke prasar ke baavjood, ausat madhyavargeey bhartiya ab bhi sex ko lekar satark or ashankit he
 But it is important to study the mindset of other India towards sex
 skool-collejon main salaah dene vaale manovigyaani yuvaaon main badhati svachhndatha kii ore ishaara karte hai
 The youth survey will probably present a different picture of India
 chaitanya bangaloru sthit lekhak or film nirdeshak hai
 The Delhi Congress, surrounded by the death of the pit, has protested in a unique way, falling further
 dilli congress ne muniraka chauraahey par hue gadde par magaramchh kaa putala pani main utaar diya

 The Congress will try to awaken the government by releasing a number
 pradarshan se lag gaya lanbaa jammuniraka chauraahey par dilli sarkaar pradarshan se lanbaa jam lag gaya darasal pehle se hi sarvice road bahut sari he or us par bade-bade gadde hai
 During the demonstrations from above, there was a long jam due to the vehicles of Congressmen
 haalanki jab is bare main congress netaaon se sawaal poocha gaya to aanan-fanan road khaali kar di gai
 The division of literature into mainstream and separate from it is wrong, the writer is a literature, no matter what he is writing, provided the public likes it
 ye baaten kahin prasidd upanyaaskaar surendra mohan pathak ne
 He further said that the people who were jealous of his success drew such a line of division
 unhone chunauti di ki vah sahityakaron jaisaa likh sakate hai lekin koi he jo unke jaisaa likhe
 On the objection of the pulpit writer over himself, he said that it was possible only with the power of the pulp that 250 pages were printed on a paper of 10 rupees
 jabaki achche kaagaj par itane pej chhapane ke liye 250 rupee lagate
 Because of the pulp paper, his novels were able to reach the homes of common people
 unhone kaha ki agar aapako sabhi ko apana dushman bananaa he to aap apni autobiography likh do
 On the Aarushi murder, he said that the government does not like to accept the investigation
 unhone kaha ki vah parampara main vishwaas karne vaale hai or kisi bhi tarah nahin maan sakate ki parents ne ek naaballig bacchee kii hatya kii
 He told about himself that his life has become very deficient by writing the characters of espionage, detective and crime
 unhone bataaya ki aisa likhane se life bahut gandi ho jaati he
 He is a very timid person, he has never seen a corpse, he has not seen blood, he has not wielded weapons but has to write, he dreams of these at night
 shamstahir khan ke sawaalon ke jawaab main unhone bataaya ki pehle vah patrkaar bananaa chaahate the, nahin ban paae to patrkaar sunil ke kairactor ko janm diya or us par kul 122 nowell likhe
 Through this, he completed all his wishes
 aaj agar kisi ek paatr ko jinda karnaa pade to vahasunilako hi jinda karnaa chahenge
 He made Detective a hero to change Variety
 lekin sabase zyada prasiddi unhen criminal ko hero banaakar mili
 The robbery of 65 lakhs was printed 22 times, also in English and Gujarati
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki ek vyakti apni patni kaa murder karke unke ghar aa gaya
 Many people also used to come to take tip
 unhone samual johnson kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki chaahe koi bhi ho vah paise ke liye hi likhata he
 He said that today there are 3 businesses which have glamor
 pehla fishan, doosraa patrakarita or teesraa cinema
 In response to a question, he said that he wrote his autobiography at the behest of the people
 lekin agar sabhi ko apana dushman bananaa he tabhi aapako autobiography likhni chahie
 On deteriorating law and order, he said that the British Raj's stand was strong, there was a police station in 8 km
 ek sipaahi jaataa tha or 8 logon ko pakad laata tha
 Today 8 go and come back after being beaten

 After the match, Kuldeep said, "their batsmen were frozen on the wicket and we knew that we needed wickets in the middle overs
 maine do wicket ek hi over main liye or isse match kaa rukh hamaari taraf ho gaya

 ' Chairman of the Board denied reports of withdrawal of Ayodhya case: Jujfar Farooqi, chairman of Sunfar Central Waqf Board, denied the information about the proposal to withdraw the Ayodhya case

 'jufar faruki ne kaha ki cese waapas lene kaa koi aavedan supreme court main nahin diya gaya he, jo bhi diya he, vah madhyastha panel ko diya he
 However, we cannot give information about what is said in it
 In response to a question, he said, 'see what is going on in the discussion that we have withdrawn our petition in the Supreme Court, there is no truth in it
 yah khabar kahaan se chali ki hamane apil waapas karne kaa halafanama diya he, yah hamako bhi nahin maaloom he

 ’jufar faruki kaha, ‘supreme court ne kaha tha ki sunwaayee chalati rahegi or agar pakshakaar chahen to madhyasthata panel ko apni baat kah sakate hai
 For this, the earlier terms of the arbitration panel will remain in force
 lihaaja hamane or kuch or pakshakaar ne madhyasthata panel ko apni baaten likhi hai
 i cannot give details of this, nor can i tell who or what did not come in it, i cannot discuss it
 ’unhone kaha, ‘hamane jo prastaav diya he or uske andar kya likhaa he, iske liye aapako intjaar karnaa padegaa
 The Supreme Court will make its information public

 This is the reason why people are making a career as a young yoga instructor
 jab ham yoga kii baat karte hai to hamaare jahan main sirf asana, pranayam, dhyaan, mudraaen hi aati hai, lekin aisa nahin he
 Yoga is a very broad subject
 iskaa kshetra karm yoga, gyaan yoga, hath yoga, mantra yoga, kudli jagriti jaise kai yoga-sadhano se he
 If you really want to do yoga and teach, then know these important skills
 
 
 (1) yoga main kariyar banane ke liye jaruri he ki aap ek achche spikar hon
 You should have the ability to explain your point through yoga from one person to the group
 (2) yoga teacher banane se pehle swany bhi yoga ke bare main vistrut jaankaree rakhen
 Do not forget that any wrong posture and exercise can lead to new disease
 nai naukari ke liye karnaa he aplai, rigeume main in galatiyon se bachenyaha milegaa kaam kaa shandaar maukayog ek vigyaan he jise seekhney ke liye yogya or prashikshit shikshak kii jarurat hoti he

 If you are doing yoga to a high-income family, individual or group, then your income will be higher

 If you are choosing yoga as a career, then know that working hours are not fixed in this field
 itnaa to tay he ki adhiktar kaam subah ke samay milenge
 On the other hand, due to the increasing demand for yoga, you can also earn a lot of work opportunities abroad as part time
 One advantage of becoming a good paisa Yoga teacher is that you take classes of yoga mostly in the morning or evening
 aise main aapke paas bich kaa puraa din hota he, jisamen aap kuch nayaa sikh sakate hai yaa koi doosraa kaam yaa bijness yaa phir apana khud kaa yoga skool bhi shuru kar sakate hai
