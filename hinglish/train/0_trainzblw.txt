 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal once again reiterated his commitment to pass the Jan Lokpal bill, saying that if the Jan Lokpal bill was not passed in the Delhi Assembly, he would resign from his post
 kejariwal ne ravivaar ko enditivi se khaas baatcheet main kaha, 'hamaara satta main rahane se zyada mahatvapurn he janalokapal bill kaa paas hona
 If the Jan Lokpal bill is not passed, we will resign
 ' He said that the Congress and the BJP are trying to impose obstacles in the way of Jan Lokpal and if they put a hurdle in this bill in the assembly, they will sacrifice their chair
 unhone kaha ki agar congress saath nahin degi, to main istipha de duungaa or janata congress ko iskaa sabak sikhayegi
 He said that his government will table the Jan Lokpal bill in the Assembly on 13 February
 isse pehle kejariwal ne kaha tha ki unhone kabhi sochaa nahin tha ki vah kabhi raajnneeti main aaenge
 Kejriwal, who was sitting on a dharna in an unprecedented manner demanding action against some policemen last month, had at the time called himself an 'anarchist'
 aaj vah us tippanee kii vyakhya karte hue tark dete hai ki bhrasht raajnneetik or coraparet netaa, kuch naukarshah or media ke kuch log khushi se rah rahe hai, jabaki aam aadmi naakhush he
 Kejriwal said, when we talk of changing the system, it turns into anarchy for these people
 unke liye, haa, main araajaktaavaadi hum
 Asked whether he would call himself a political revolutionary, the 45-year-old leader said, yes, political revolutionary, yes
 unase sawaal kiya gaya ki vah un logon ke liye kya kahenge, jo unhen taanashaah bulaate hai
 To this, Kejriwal said, do you think people like Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav can work with a dictator? Many people are coming to us
 kya ve ek taanashaah ke saath kaam karenge? Kejriwal said that the leadership of 'AAP' has been in 'totality' and if we were dictators, even four people would not have stood with us
 yah puche jane par ki kya unhone kabhi sochaa tha ki unke sapane raajnneeti tak jaaenge, kejariwal ne kaha ki oktober, 2012 main party kaa gathan kiye jane ke baad unhen kuch acha karne kii ummid thi, lekin unhone nahin sochaa tha ki vah dilli ke mukhyamantri ban jaaenge
 On the question whether he now aspires to become Prime Minister, he replied in the negative and insisted that his aim is to make India corruption free, for which the struggle of 'AAP' continues
 unhone kaha, ham yahaan satta kii raajnneeti karne ke liye nahin aae hai
 Asked whether he would become the Prime Minister despite this, Kejriwal said, anyone can predict
 koun jaanata he? It is not yet decided for Kejriwal whether he will contest the Lok Sabha elections or not, but he said, if the need arises, i will contest, but my first priority is Delhi
 unhone kaha ki 'aap' un loksabhaa nirvachan kshetron kii pahchaan karegi, jahaan se duusari partiyon ke bhrasht ummidavaar chunaav lard rahe hai or ham unke khilaaf ladenge
 This number can be 150 or 200 or 250 or 350
 kejariwal ne kaha, ham yah nahin kah rahe hai ki hamaari party centre main sarkaar banaaegi
 
 
 But the more number of our people get elected to Parliament, the more difficult it will become for corrupt people
 narendra modi yaa rahul gandhi par koi tippanee karne se inkaar karte hue kejariwal ne kaha, main keval itnaa kah saktaa hum ki donon ek hi raajnneetik vyavastha ke hisse hai or main nahin samajhataa ki aapako donon se koi ummid he
 Kejriwal was very clear in the matter that in the event of a hung verdict in the Lok Sabha elections, AAP will not go with any political party or participate in 'politics of power'
 mukhyamantri ne kaha, ham jienge, ladenge or marenge, aap dekhenge
 Kejriwal does not mind calling himself a hasty chief minister
 vah kehete hai, main samajhataa hum ki kisi ko bhi jaldbaaji main hona chahie
 Time is short and life is short
 ek din main keval 24 ghante hote hai
 Asked what has changed in his life after sitting in the chair of power, Kejriwal said that his first victim was his family life
 unhone kaha, shanivaar ko parivaar ke saath film dekhnaa band ho gaya he
 There is no neighborhood in Kejriwal's government house
 gajiabad main, jahaan vah pehle rahete the, unki maa or patni ghar se baahar jaati thim or padosiyon ke saath gapshap karti thim

 The holy Amarnath cave is 13 thousand feet in height and 950 km from Delhi
 hamane pavitra amarnath ke darshan kii yojana banaai
 There were many hurdles in this plan
 sabase badi aadchan baar-baar badalata kharaab mausam tha
 Thousands of passengers were stopped from place to place due to heavy rains
 lagaataar ho rahe bhuskhalan or glacier ke tuutane se rasta band hone kii baadha thi or duusari chunauti aatanki khataron ke bich hamaari suraksha thi
 The journey from Delhi to the holy Amarnath cave is generally considered to be five days
 hamane bhi pavitra amarnath gupha tak kii yatra hawaii jahaaj, helicopter, jeep, khachchar or paidal puri kii
 After all, in order to know how NDTV India reached the holy Amarnath cave despite all the risks, you have to read this story completely
 dilli se srinagar vaaya jammu kii flite 8 bajkar 45 minute par he
 First Jammu, then we landed at Srinagar Airport at around 11 am
 lekin kharaab mausam ne hamaara aage kaa rasta roak liya
 The Jhelum river was flowing above the danger mark due to the incessant rains in Srinagar
 nadi kaa pani sadakon par bhar gaya jiske chalate hamen srinagar ke ITBP camp main waapas lautnaa padaa
 There are two routes from Srinagar to the holy Amarnath Yatra, the first is about 106 km from Srinagar to the holy Amarnath cave via Sonamarg, Baltal, Barari
 doosraa jammu se pahalgam hote hue, chandanwari, pissu top, sheshnag, panchtarini hote hue amarnath gupha tak kareeb 325 kimi kaa safar
 Thousands of passengers were stranded due to heavy rains which damaged the roadway
 tab hamane srinagar se sonmarg or phir sonmarg se panchtarini hote hue amarnath gupha tak janaa tay kiya
 After four hours stay in Srinagar we left for Sonamarg by car
 2014 main srinagar main ai baadh ke chalate hajaaron gadiyon main pani bhar gaya tha isi ke chalate barish se pehle hi sadak par logon ne gaadiyaan khadi kar deen
 Sonamarg is about 80 km from Srinagar
 lekin kharaab mausam ke chalate ham der raat ko sonmarg pahunche
 After the overnight rain, the weather of Sonmarg cleared in the morning, then we started our journey again
 hamaare saath IPS adhikari rajababu singh, dilli police ke inspector sanjeev mandal, SS Techno company ke ashok ksaana or ajay upaadhyaay bhi the
 Everyone said that we will go to Nilgrant first
 phir vahaan se helicopter ke jariye panchtarini jaaenge, phir vahaan se paidal yaa khachchar ke jariye amarnath yatra karenge
 But it is very difficult to understand the weather of the mountain
 sonmarg se nilgrant helipad par pahunchate-pahunchate phir barish shuru ho gai or helicopter seva baadhit ho gai
 Thousands of pilgrims going to Nilgrant Helipad to Panchtarini had to wait here for several days due to the closure of all roadways
 lekin kuch hi ghanton baad mausam saaf hone laga or hamaari panchtarini pahunchane kii ummid badhane lagi
 Now the weather gradually started to clear
 barsaat ke badal dhire-dhire chantane lage
 Our helicopter started getting ready for flight
 ham helicopter main savaar ho gaye
 During the flight we reached the Panchtarini valley after a flight of about seven minutes over the Panchtarini river
 yahaan paanch nadiyaan milti hai isi ke chalate is nadi ko panchtarini nadi kaha jaataa he
 Thousands of tents are installed here
 dopaher baad yahaan pahunchane vaale yatriyon ko upar amarnath nahin jane diya jaataa he
 We are around 12 noon
 30 baje panchtarini pahunch gaye
 Due to the incessant rains here, the road had deteriorated
 hamen paanch baje tak har haal main panchtarini ke is helipad par waapas aana tha
 The weather was forecast to be bad again in the evening
 tippaniyan There are three ways to get from Panchtarini to the holy Amarnath cave
 yaa to aap yahaan paidal chadhaai chadhate hai yaa phir palki or khachchar se bhi aap pavitra amarnath gupha tak ja sakate hai
 After walking for two km, we found such a bad path full of mud that walking was almost impossible
 barish ke kaaran rasta bahut phislan bharaa ho gaya tha
 Once, i too survived falling from the mule into the ditch
 khachchar ke saath chal rahe shabbir ne kisi tarah sambhala
 The journey of Baba Amarnath cannot be complete without the cooperation of thousands of locals like Shabbir
 panchtarini se amarnath ghati tak pahunchane ke bich kii ek jagah he jo sangam kehalaati he
 a small footpath road comes from Pahalgam and meets here
 is jagah se pavitra amarnath gupha kii duuri teen kimi he
 Speaking of bam bam bhole, we are moving through dangerous paths of travel
 ab ham amarnath ghati pahunch chuke hai
 This valley was once covered with snow
 lekin is saal glacier bahut kam he
 The glaciers are also constantly melting and falling, which keeps the risk of life equal
 amarnath ghati se pavitra gupha kii jhalak hamen milane lagi, isi ke darshan karne ke liye shraddhalu tamaam khatre mol lete hai
 But on this difficult journey, along with the weather, there is also the shadow of terrorist threat, so 40 thousand security personnel are deployed on the rumble
 suraksha karmiyon kii chintaa aatanki hamale ke saath kharaab mausam main biimaar hone vaale yatri bhi hai
 The hill near Amarnath Cave looks like Sheshnag Hill which is covered with snow
 baba amarnath kii gupha kareeb bees meter lambii or 16 meter chaudee he
 Within this, we got a glimpse of the holy Amarnath in this way
 baba amarnath kii katha bhi kam chilachasp nahin he
 The flight from Delhi to Srinagar via Jammu is at 8
45 AM
 pehle jammu, phir ham kareeb 11 baje srinagar airport par utre
 But bad weather blocked our way forward
 srinagar main ho rahi lagaataar barish ke chalate jhelum nadi khatre ke nishaan se upar bah rahi thi
 The water of the river filled the roads, due to which we had to return to the ITBP camp in Srinagar
 srinagar se pavitra amarnath yatra ke do raste hai, pehla srinagar se sonmarg, baltal, baraari hote hue pavitra amarnath gupha tak kareeb 106 kimi tak kaa safar
 The second is about 325 km from Jammu via Pahalgam, Chandanwadi, Flea Top, Sheshnag, Panchtarini to Amarnath Cave
 baari barish kii vajah se sadak kaa rasta kharaab ho gaya tha jisase hajaaron yatri jagah-jagah funs gaye
 Then we decided to go from Srinagar to Sonamarg and then from Sonamarg to Panchtarini to Amarnath cave
 srinagar main chaar ghante rukne ke baad ham gaadi se sonmarg ke liye ravaanaa hue
 Due to floods in Srinagar in 2014, thousands of vehicles were flooded due to which people parked vehicles on the road before the rain
 srinagar se sonmarg kareeb 80 kimi dur he
 But due to bad weather we reached Sonamarg in the late night
 raatbhar barish ke baad subah sonmarg kaa mausam saaf hua to hamane phir apni yatra shuru kii
 We were accompanied by IPS officer Rajababu Singh, Inspector Sanjeev Mandal of Delhi Police, Ashok Kasana of SS Techno Company and Ajay Upadhyay
 sabane kaha ki ham pehle nilgrant jaaenge
 Then from there he will go to Panchtarini by helicopter, then from there he will travel to Amarnath by foot or mule
 lekin kehete hai ki pahaad ke mausam ko samajhnaa bahut mushkil he
 On reaching the Nilgrant helipad from Sonmarg, it started raining again and helicopter service was interrupted
 sadak ke sabhi raste band hone ke chalate nilgrant helipad se helicopter ke sahare panchtarini jane vaale hajaaron tirthayatriyon ko yahaan bhi kai din intjaar karnaa padaa
 But after a few hours the weather started to clear and our hopes of reaching Panchtarini started increasing
 ab mausam dhire-dhire saaf hone laga
 The rainy clouds started slowly sorting
 hamaara helicopter udaan ke liye taiyaar hone laga
 We boarded a helicopter
 udaan ke dauraan panchtarini nadi ke upar kareeb saat minute kii udaan ke baad ham panchtarini ghati pahunch gaye
 Five rivers are found here, due to which this river is called Panchtarini river
 yahaan hajaaron tambu is lage hai
 Passengers arriving here in the afternoon are not allowed to go up to Amarnath
 ham dopaher kareeb 12
 Reached Panchtarini at 30
 yahaan lagaataar ho rahi barish ke chalate rasta kharaab ho chukaa tha
 We were to return to this helipad of Panchtarini by five o'clock
 shaam ko phir se mausam kharaab hone kaa anumaan tha
 The comments panchtarini se pavitra amarnath gupha tak jane ke teen tareeke hai
 Either you climb here on foot or you can also go to the holy Amarnath cave with palanquin and mule
 do kimi tak paidal chalane ke baad hamen kichad se bharaa itnaa kharaab rasta mila ki paidal chalanaa lagbhag naammumkin sa ho gaya tha
 The path had become very slippery due to rain
 ek baar to main bhi khachchar se khai main girte girte bachaa
 Shabbir, who was walking with the mule, somehow managed
 shabbir jaise hajaaron sthaneey logon ke sahyog ke bina baba amarnath kii yatra puri nahin ho sakati he
 There is a place between Panchtarini to reach Amarnath valley which is called Sangam
 ek chota sa pagadendinuma rasta pahalgam se aakar yahaan miltaa he
 The distance of the holy Amarnath cave from this place is three km
 bam bam bhole bolte hue ham yatra ke khatarnaak raaston se aage bad rahe hai
 Now we have reached the Amarnath valley
 ye ghati kabhi barf se dhaki rahati thi
 But this year the glacier is much lower
 jo glacier he wo bhi lagaataar pighalkar gir rahe hai jisase jaan kaa khatra baraabar bana rahata he
 We get a glimpse of the holy cave from the Amarnath Valley, devotees take many risks to see it
 lekin is kathin yatra par mausam kii maar ke saath aatanki khatre kaa saaya bhi he, lihaaja 40 hajaar surakshakarmi chappe chappe par tainaat hai
 Concerns of security personnel are also the passengers who become ill in bad weather with terrorist attack
 amarnath gupha ke paas kii pahari sheshnag pahari dikhti he jo barf se dhaki he
 Baba Amarnath's cave is about twenty meters long and 16 meters wide
 isi ke andar hamen pavitra amarnath ke is tarah darshan mili
 The story of Baba Amarnath is no less interesting

 Book: Days of Autumn Writer: Tushar Upgrade Price: Rs 80 You are able to read this book review because you have a computer
 wo yantra jisaki madad se aap duniyabar kii soochna bator sakate hai
 The only problem is that your computer cannot give those 'information' the status of 'knowledge'
 iske liye kisi samajhadaar insaan yaa kisi asal ghatana se aapkaa rubaru hona kaaphi ahm he
 This is also the reason for writing this book

 The author of the book, Tushar Upreti, is also from our era
 jaahir he hamaari tarah unhen bhi ye sari baaten yun hi pataa chal gayi thi
 Sometimes a family member explained
 kabhi daadi-nani ne aise-aise kisse sunaae ki wo baaten hamaare central nervas system main sadaa ke liye feed ho gayi hai
 But the authors also understand and we also know that today's children are far away from the stories of grandmother and grandmother
 sabhi bachche bhale hi itane badanaseeb nahin hai, lekin adhiktar bacchon kii samasya yahi he
 Working parents are unable to give time to the children
 skool main teacher bas silebus jet speed main cover karne main lage hai
 The grandmother and grandmother do not fit the equation of 'chhota Parivar', so they too are in the village
 aise main 40 pannon kii yah kitaab ek koshish he ki bacchon ko unki bhashaa main jaruri baaten bataayin jaaen
 The stories are also written on this plot, which matches the everyday life of children
 isliye bacchon ko kitaab kii kahani apni si lagegi
 However, in some cases, she seems strange in the matter of simplifying the stories
 lekin kitaab kii shuruyaat main hi yah saaf kar diya gaya he ki isaki torget audiens paanch se das saal ke umr kii he
 So it is useless to expect logic in every story
 yah kitaab bacchon ke liye he, to unhen padhane kii salaah jarur duungi
 But even if older people take only 15 minutes to read it, then every story will take you through your childhood with great ease and you will remember your childhood days

 SBI, the country's largest public sector bank, has decided to recover the penalty for not having a minimum balance in the bank account once again after a gap of five years
 yah jurmaana 1 april se lagu hoga
 Apart from this, the State Bank of India (SBI) has also changed the charge for other services including ATM
 esbiai ke nae niyamon ke anusaar seaving acounts main teen baad cash jamaa karana nishulk rahegaa
 But after this, a charge and service charge of Rs 50 will have to be paid on every cash transaction
 vahiin karant acountke maamle main yah charge adhiktam 20,000 rupee bhi ho saktaa he
 As per the new rules of SBI, if you do not keep the prescribed minimum average balance (MAB) in your bank accounts, a penalty of up to Rs 100 can be imposed every month and you will also have to pay service tax
 nae niyamon ke anusaar, emebi shulk bank shakha kii jagah ke hisaab se alag-alag ho saktaa he
 If the minimum balance in the account of the account holders of the urban area will be 75% of Rs
 5,000, then they will have to pay Rs
 100 as penalty and service tax thereon
 vahiin agar bakaayaa nunatam raashi ke 50 pratishat athwa usase bhi kam he to aisi sthiti main bank 50 rapaye or sarvice tex vasulegaa
 So in case of account holders in rural areas, this penalty may be minimal
 isi tarah state bank ke graahakon ko ek maheene main duusare bank ke atm se teen baar se zyada cash nikaalane par 20 rupee kaa charge dena hoga
 On the other hand, if the customer does more than five transactions from sbi's ATM, then a fee of Rs 10 will be charged each time

 At the same time, if the balance in the account is more than one lakh rupees, the customers of State Bank can transact as many times as possible from the atms of other banks
 iske liye unase koi charge nahin liya jayega
 Apart from this, banks will charge Rs 15 every quarter for sending SMS alerts from debit card holders of SBI, who keep an average balance of Rs 25,000 in the account on a quarterly basis
 bhartiya rigerv bank ne in nae niyamon par bainkon ko ijaajat de di he or ye shulk is saal 1 april se lagu ho jaaenge

 org / privet aspataalon main EWS yani aarthik taur par kamjor tabake se aane vaale marijon ke bed agar 20 fisadi se zyada khaali rah jate hai to sarkaar ko ye manjuur nahin hoga
 In fact, 41 private hospitals in Delhi have 623 beds for free treatment of EWS patients, out of which only 30 to 40 percent of the patients are available
 aise marijon ko bhartee karne main privet aspataal minamekh nikaal kar anakani karte hai, lihaaja sarkaar ne tay kiya he ki ab sarkari aspataal bhi marijon ko refer kar sakenge
 Health Minister Satyendar Jain of Delhi Government said that the Health Department will also appoint 85 Patient Welfare Officers who will keep an eye on private hospitals
 41 aspataalon ke alaava sarita vihaar ke indraprastha apollo aspataal main EWS marijon ke 239 bed hai, jinamein 90 fisadi is vajah se khaali rahete hai ki bed to mil jaataa he par ilaaj ke paise mariz ko dene hote hai
 The matter is still in the Supreme Court, but until the verdict is reached, the state government has decided to open a medicine shop here where the poor patients will get medicines at 80% discount
 EWS pesheynt monitering cameti ke sadsy ashok agarwal ne kaha ki sarkaar ne yahaan tak faisla liya he ki jo log apollo main dawa or baaki kharch nahin uthaa sakate, unka kharch bhi vahi vahan karegi
 According to the government, private hospitals earn about 75 crore annually by keeping the beds of EWS quota empty
 isaki ek ahm vajah marijon ko apane haq kii sahi jaankaree nahin milanaa bhi he
 Ashok Aggarwal says that if a poor person does not have any document, he should fill out the declaration form
 kaaphi he
 And this form will also give private hospital

 unhone mahabuuba par party or purv pidipi-bijepi gathbandhan sarkaar main bhai-bhatijawad kaa aarope lagaaya
 Former minister Imran said in indirect reference to the newly appointed Tasduk Mufti in politics to be cabinet minister this year and giving Mehbooba's relative Sartaj Madni an important position in the party, saying, 'it was a shame of a family run by brothers, uncles and other relatives was going
 pipuls democratic party ‘family democratic party’ ban gai he
 Farooq Andrabi, another relative of the PDP president, was also made a minister for some time
 imran ne daawa kiya ki unhone mahabuuba se kai baar kaha tha ki ye rishtedaar aapako aksham banaaenge lekin unhone sarkaar girane tak is baat par koi dhyaan nahin diya

 unhone kaha ki ham kejariwal ke ghar apni baat lekar gaye the, lekin unhone hamaari koi baat nahin suni, ulta ham logon ko apamaanit kiya
 This is the black day of history, politics is black day

 'we want the people of Delhi to benefit' Manoj Tiwari says that i went to meet Kejriwal after breaking all protocols
 ham chaahate hai ki dilli kii janata kaa phayda ho unke saath jo samasyaayein hai unka samaadhaan ho, lekin unhone hamaari ek bhi baat nahin suni

 ' dilli kii arvind kejariwal sarkaar ko bhale hi vidhansabha main apni salaamati ko lekar shaq or shankaa ho lekin dilli ke lok kalyaan mantri manish sisodiya ne buudhvaar der raat phir se kai ilaakon main rain baseron kaa auchak nirikshan kiya or kai jagahon par adhikariyon ko fatkaar bhi lagaai
 10 of the night
 05 baje manish sisodiya purvi dilli main akshardham ke paas pandav nagar main bane ek rain baseraa main pahunche
 The good thing was that the carpet lying on the ground in that night shelter was good, new
 mantri ji ne logon kii takalifon ke bare main poocha or vahaan ke register check kiye
 At 10
40 pm, Manish Sisodia reached Turkman Gate area near Ramlila Maidan
 sadak par so rahe rickshawvaalon se baat kii
 Carpets and blankets also looked new here, perhaps the officials had already received the news of the minister's arrival
 aage badhate hue jab manish sisodiya puraani dilli ilaake ke digambar jain mandir pahunche to vahaan khule main baithi kai bajurg mahilaon se saamana hua
 He ordered them to be sent to the night shelters
 raat saadhe 11 baje mantri ji chandani chowk ke paas bane ek rain baseraa main daakhil hue lekin kai khidakiyon se gaayab shishe ko dekhakar is kadakadaati thand main bhi unka paara garm ho gaya
 On the phone itself, the Executive Engineer was fiercely rebuked
 raat ke 12 baje manish sisodiya pahunche puraani dilli railway stesan ke paas fatahepuri ke rain basere main
 Here too, he spoke to the people and reprimanded the authorities for misbehavior
 dilli kii sard raaton main kisi mantri kaa yun logon ke bich pahunchnaa tasviir to acchhee pesh kar rahaa he lekin ashanka is baat kii bhi he ki janata ko lubhaane kaa kahin ye aap kii sarkaar kaa shuruaati siyaasi prapanch sabit na ho jaae
 The 29th state of the Indian Republic has emerged
 iske saath hi kai dashakon se chale aa rahe ek sangharsh or vivaad kaa ant ho gaya he
 Of the hero of the Telangana movement
 chandrashekhar raav ne andhra pradesh se alag hue rajya ke netritv kii kaman apane haath main le lee he
 Politics games are also strange, people speaking the same language have now got two states
 chandrashekhar raav jo kesiar ke naam se jane jate hai congress ke netaa the or baad main is andolan kii kaman apane haathon main lekar telangna kshetra main ek nayak kii tarah ubhare or aaj uske mukhiya ban gaye
 The interesting thing is that the Congress, which pushed for the formation of this state, lagged behind in the power game and took all the credit for KCR
 jis andhra pradesh se congress ne pichley lok sabha chunaav main sabase zyada siten jeetin, unke haath kuch nahin aayaa
 In fact, the party had to bear the brunt of the strange way in which this state was divided
 aaazaad bharat main ek rajya ke bantwaare ke baad doosraa rajya banane kii yah koi nai dastaan nahin he, pehle bhi kai rajya bane
 But the sad part is that except for a couple or two, the promises that were made during the movement were not fulfilled
 uttarakhand, jharkhand or yahaan tak ki chhattisgarh kaudaaharan hamaare saamne he
 All these states did not meet the public's statistics and the situation is the same as before
 darasal jin logon neun andolanon kii kaman apane haathon main lee thi ve yaa to raste se bhatak gaye yaa phir unhen aage kaa rasta hi nahin soojha
 The people of those states did not get any benefit, just the army of bureaucrats flourished
 bhrasht sthaneey netaaon kii ban ai or unhone jamkar shoshan kiya
 KCR, like a politician, has made broad promises to the people there and said that he will end corruption
 unhone janakalyaan kii badi yojanaon ke shuruyaat kii bhi baaten kahi hai
 Now it depends on his loyalty and commitment to what he is able to do
 baharhaal nae rajya ke janm par yahi shubhakamana di ja sakati he ki yah rajya fale-foole or janata kii aakankshaon par khara utre
 So welcome this new state of India, which the people have found after waiting for a long time and expect that the chariot of progress will run here at a fast pace

 vishwa swasthya sanghathan kii ek report ke mutabik, seb or kuch anya falon ko pastisids ke saath treetment kiya jaataa he, jisase ki unamem fungus or keede naa lagen
 Pesticides increase crop production, but at the same time some peptides are extremely harmful to the human body
 falon or subjiyon ko ghar par achche se dhoyaa jaataa he
 But researchers believe that washing vegetables and fruits is not enough
 pastisids se swasthya par kai nakaaratmak asar ho rahe hai
 It is severely affecting the nervous system, skin, eye and hormone systems
 kuch pastisids se cancer hone kii ashanka bhi jataai gai he
 Many types of fruits and vegetables such as strawberries and spinach are more likely to contain pesticides
 in subjiyon or falon ko pani se kitna hi dhul len lekin isse koi fark nahin padataa he
 If pregnant women consume fruits to stay healthy, then tell you that eating fruits and vegetables can prove to be harmful for them and their child
 harvard uniwarsity kii ek study main yah paaya gaya ki jo mahilaayein fertility treetment kara rahi hai or is tarah ke falon-subjiyon kaa zyada seven kar rahi hai, unke pregnant hone yaa jinda bachche ko janm dene kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he
 According to this study, if a woman is consuming more pesticides through fruits and vegetables, the chances of giving birth to a live baby are reduced by 26 percent
 ek research ne pastiside ke avshesh phosmet or thiabandzol hataane ke liye bleech, pani or baking soda kaa istemaal kiya
 Based on this, he has published a study
 study ke mutabik, pastisids ko hataane main baking soda sabase zyada kargar rahaa kyonki baking soda main pastisids degrade hote hai
 While bleach is mainly used to kill bacteria
 haalanki pastisids ko hataane kaa koi bhi tarika 100 pratishat kargar nahin rahaa
 These vegetables-fruits contain more pesticides - strawberrypalakasabashpatiangurtmatter i can’t help but feel bad for the SPCA robot outside that someone smeared their poo on

 buraadi main 11 mauton ne sabko sann karke rakh diya
 But slowly, hidden under the cover of mystery, conjecture, apprehension, tantra-mantra, many ends of this story are beginning to take hold
 sabase bada saboot or gavaah wo register he, jo buraadi kii hatyaon kii insaide story bataa rahaa he
 According to sources, the needle of suspicion has been stuck on Lalit, the younger son of the family, as the architect of the Burari incident
 ghar main baraamad hue register, diary or baaki sabooton se ishaara mil rahaa he ki tantra-mantra ke pher main hi buraadi kaa bhaatia parivaar hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye ujaad gaya
 After returning the voice, Lalit began to see his father constantly

 ek rose lalit ke pita ne use parivaar se unki mulaakaat karaane kaa aadesh bhi diya
 In a register, Lalit has written quoting his father, 'I will come tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, if i cannot come then i will come later
 ' register main likhi har baat lalit likh rahaa tha
 After meeting his father, he started writing about meeting God in this register
 sari baaten is tarah likhi gayi jaise pita bhopal singh likh rahe hon
 It was further written in the register, 'you know that God can come to our house at any time, so be fully prepared
 ' beete shanivaar kii raat or ravivaar ke bich jo kuch bhaatia parivaar ne kiya us ke bare main bhi lalit ne register ke ek panne par tafsil se sabakuch likhaa he
 'there will be a shock at the last moment, the sky will move, the earth will move
 lekin tum ghabraana mat, mantra jaap tej kar dena, main tumhen bachaa luungaa
 Getting down when the water changes color, helping each other down
 tum maroge nahin, balki kuch bada hasil karoge

 hovitger se fire kiya gaya har ek shot record kiya jaataa he
 In this, trajectory, speed, frequency, range etc
 are monitored and data are recorded
 yahaan biei systams ke america or swiss research or jawan data ikattha karne main bhartiya javaanon kii madad karte hai
 BAE Systems will supply the Howitzer cannon to India
 is data kaa upyog yuddh ke dauraan firing ke liye kiya jaataa he, joki behad mahatvapurn he
 The Howitzer cannon takes only three minutes to get into action and 2 minutes to pack
 hovitger main 155mm ke sabhi tarah gola barood istemaal kiye ja sakate hai
 However, it is currently being tested with only four types of 155mm ammunition
 isamen echi, smoke, ilumination or fire shaamil hai
 However, so far the Indian Army has received only 2 howitzers

 The remaining 120 howitzers will be manufactured in India by Mahindra Defense and BAE Systems

 At the same time, it is half its size and is very convenient to carry
 ise sumdr ke jariye bhi le jaaya ja saktaa he to hawa main bhi lift kiya ja saktaa he
 The Howitzer cannon sits like a scorpion
 yani dushmano ke liye ise khoj paanaa bhi aasaan nahin hoga
 Howitzers can easily destroy enemy targets 4 kilometers in direct range and 30 to 40 kilometers in indirect range
 bhartiya sena ne ajtak ko hovitger kii fire power ko bhi dikhaaya, lekin hovitger kii garjana iske prabhaav ko bataa paane main puraa nyaay nahin karti he
 Here are the figures: Howitzer is fatal to the enemy at a distance of 50 meters, while its Danger range is 250 meters
 155mm ke 45 kilogram vaale gola barood main 10 kilogram visphotak hota he or 35 kilogram loha hota he
 The Pokhranaki desert ranges have now become accustomed to these cannons, which are famous for thundering and shuddering in the ranks of enemies

 But aside from earnings, the film 'housefull 4' has not managed to win the hearts of critics
 film sameekshak taran adarsh ne 'housephul 4' It has given only one and a half stars, has also described this movie as the weakest film in the 'housefull' series
 twit ke anusaar film logon ko hansaane ke liye to puri takat lagaati he, lekin iskaa kharaab diarection or over da top parformens film ko le duba
 The story of 'housefull 4' is from 1419 in Sitamgarh where Akshay (bobby Deol), Ritesh, Kriti, Pooja and Kriti Sanon love each other, but for some reasons They are separated from it
 chah sau saal baad teenon jode punarjanm lete hai, or iske baad phir shuru hoti he housephul tip kanfusion
 Miss match of Couples and many cameos one after the other

 # vivoipledition # iplopeningceremony desh ke kai hisson main cash kaa sankat dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 In some places, the current conditions are being compared to demonetisation
 ab khabar ai he ki desh kii rajdhani samet samoochaa ensiaar ilaaka bhi aane vaale dinon main cash ke sankat se jujh saktaa he
 The reason is being told that cash has not been supplied in NCR banks and atms for the last six days
 ek maheene pehle rigerv bank of india ne bainkon ke ek sarkal se duusare sarkal main zyada cash transfar karne par roak laga di thi
 The banks of NCR say that at present, it is being provided 200 and 100 notes by RBI
 bainkon kaa kahana he ki 2000 ke note chhodie, 500 ke note bhi kaaphi kam maatra main aa rahe hai
 Cash was supplied here last Wednesday and only 30 per cent of the amount required by these banks was given
 8 fisadi atm khaali, in rajyon main badha sankatjankaree ke mutabik is samay desh bhar main saare atm main se aath fisadi atm main cash nahin he
 At present, 25 percent of the total atms in the country are with State Bank of India and 16 percent of its atms do not have any money
 tyohaari sijan hone kii vajah se ek baar phir atm or bainkon main nakadi nikaalane ke liye line lagane lagi hai
 Maximum cash problems are coming in banks and atms in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Jharkhand, Gujarat and now it is being said that Delhi, Ghaziabad, Noida and Gurgaon may also be affected
 vitt mantri bole- cash kii kami nahinhaalanki, mangalvaar ko cash sankat par vitt mantri arun jetali ne sarkaar kii ore se safai pesh kii he
 Jaitley has said that he has reviewed the entire situation and there is no shortage of cash in the country at this time
 unhone kaha he ki sirf kuch jagahon par achaanak maang bad jane se ye dikkat saamne ai he
 The Finance Minister tweeted on Tuesday, i have reviewed the country's cash problem
 bazaar or bainkon main paryaapt maatra main cash maujuud he
 The exact problem that has come to the fore is because the demand for cash has suddenly increased in some places
 RBI ne kaha- samasya kuch dinon kicash sankat par vittamantri ke baad ab arabiai kaa bhi bayaan aayaa he
 RBI has said that there is no cash crisis in the country
 bainkon ke paas paryaapt maatra main cash maujuud he
 This crisis has arisen due to logistic problem only in some atms
 arabiai ne kaha ki atm ke alaava bank branch main bhi bharpoor maatra main cash maujuud he
 RBI has ordered all banks to arrange cash at atms
 RBI ne kaha he ki march-april ke dauraanis prakaar kii samasyaati he pichley saal bhi aisa hua tha
 This problem is only for a day or two
 ferj kiijie ki aap sukun dene vaala koi khubasurat gaanaa sun rahe hai
 Along with the music, the lyrics of the songs are dissolving in your heart and heart like honey
 tabhiurdu kaa ek shabdaaata he or aap baglein jhaankne lagate hai
 If you do not understand the meaning of any one line, then it seems that something is incomplete
 ham aapako unurdu shabdon kaa matlab or sandarbhbata rahe hai jo akasar bollywood ke gaanon main istemaal hote hai
 These words are not difficult, are always around you, yet many people do not know the meaning of them
 ummid he ab aap na sirf gaanon ko behatar dhang se samaj paaenge, balki agali baar jab koi dost 'khalish', 'ibaadat' yaa 'bekudi' jaise kisi shabd par atakegaa, to apane 'gyaan' kii shekhi bhi baghaar paaenge
 Word number 1: Khalishmatlab: Chubhansandarbh: Khalish means the sensation of prick
 bhaavnaatmak sandarbhon, balki prem kii judaai aadi ke sandarbh main hi iskaa istemaal zyada hota he
 Be sure to learn the word, but keep in mind that in the 21st century, someone will give you a pin and you say that it is going to be ridiculous
 gaanaa:bin tere, bine tere koi khalish he, hawaaon main bin tereshbd number 2: inayatamatalab:krupa, meharbanisandarbh:shabd ke arth se hi spasht he, kisi ke prati ehsaan jataane kaa vinamr tarika he
 In the film 'saat Khoon Maaf', the evergreen Gulzar writes, 'ik zara pasar yahar keeje, will be gracefully
 aapako dekhakar badi der se meri saans rukii he
 'song: Thank you your grace word number 3: Bekhudimatlab: Mindless injustice, repentance, basudhi, bekhbarisandarbha:' Be-khudi 'means free from self
 yun samajhie ki kisi ko pyaar ho jaae to vah uske ehsaas ke charan main vah 'bekudi' main chalaa jaataa he
 That is, he loses his good-mercury
 zyaadaatar iskaa istemaal sakaaratmak sandarbhon main hi hota he, lekin geetkaaron ne nakaaratmak bekudi ke bhi prayog kiye hai
 Of course, man can go out of love even in times of depression
 gaanaa:bekudi main sanam, uth gaye jo qadamaa gaye, aa gaye, aa gaye paas hamshabda number 4: rabtamatalab:rishta, judaav, taalluq, samparksandarbh:do log agar paraspar 'rabta' hai to yah samajhie ki donon main koi judaav he
 Meaning if any feeling of old love is left unsaid, it can be called 'rabta'
 yah sabase zyada prachlit vyakhyaaon main se ek he, iskaa istemaal kai sandarbhon main ho saktaa he
 Song: Kuch hai tujhse rabbatbird No 5: Qurbatmatlab: close, kinship, talukasandarbh: simple

 Song: Give me a few moments of Qurbat, Fakir Hum Teri Chahat Ke (or Ali, Rahm Ali) How will i be able to live apart from your Qurbat, come in my arms floor test main uddhav sarkaar ko 169 vot milipahale hi din bijepi ne sadan main kaata hangaamaamaharashtra main uddhav sarkaar floor test main paas ho chuki he
 a total of 169 votes were cast in the Uddhav government's favor in the majority test
 vahiin, vipaksh main ek bhi vot nahin padaa
 a total of 4 mlas remained neutral during the voting, while MNS did not vote in favor of the government
 haalanki isse pehle sadan main bijepi ne jamkar bavaal kaata
 Former CM Devendra Fadnavis called the majority test and Uddhav Thackeray's oath against the constitution
 bahumat pareekshan ke bich main hi bijepi ne walk out kar diya
 In such a situation, on the very first day, Uddhav had to see the strict attitude of Fadnavis
 haalanki hangaame ke bich siem uddhav thakare, purv mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis se gale milane ke liye vipaksh ke netaa kii kursi ke paas gaye the
 Uddhav hugs Fadnavis
 uddhav sarkaar ne paas kiya floor test, 169 vidhayakon ne diya samarthanrajyapal se karenge shikaytah fadanvisasdan kii shuruyaat hote hi fadanvis ne kaha ki vande maataram se sadan kii shuruyaat kyon nahin hui
 This started hooting from the BJP camp
 fadanvis ne kaha ki kabhi bhi jab floor test hota he to pehle regular spikar kii niyukti ke baad hota he
 So, keeping the rules in mind, he chose a pro tem speaker and got a floor test done
 unhone kaha ki jo sabha samvidhan ke hisaab se nahin chalati, usamen ham shaamil nahin ho sakate
 The constitution rules have been violated, so the governor should cancel the proceedings
 ham rajyapal ke paas jaaenge or unako aniyamitata kaa patr denge
 Why was the Protem Speaker replaced? Fadnavis said that it is necessary to remain a Protem Speaker until a new Speaker is appointed
 protem spikar ko kyon badla gaya
 If this same convention is going on then why was the Protem Speaker changed
 yah galat he
 This has never happened in the history of the country
 aisa kya dar tha yaa kya jarurat thi ki protem spikar badla gaya
 Floor test cannot be done before the Speaker's election
 jab tak sthaayee spikar niyukt nahin kiya jaataa tab tak vishwaas prastaav nahin laayaa ja saktaa
 The pro tem speaker dismissed the claim, led by former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, BJP members said that holding a two-day special session is a violation of the rules
 haalanki protem spikar dilip valase patil ne bhaajapa kii aapatti ko yah kehete hue khaarij kar diya ki vishesh satr kaa aayojan rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari ke nirdeshon ke anusaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Maharashtra test Aghadi got support of 169 mlas in floor test
 jisamen uddhav sarkaar ke paksh main shivasena ke 56, ensipi ke 54, congress ke 44, sapa ke 2, swabhimani shetakari ke ek, bahujan vikaas aghadi ke 3, peedblupi ke ek or 10 nirdaleey vidhayakon ne voting kii
 In this, 169 mlas cast their vote as a NCP MLA was made a Protem Speaker

 Aam Aadmi Party leader Kumar Vishwas faced opposition on the way before reaching Amethi
 amethi ja rahe kumaar ke kafile ko jagadishpur main kuch pradarshnakariyon ne roka or kaale jhande dikhaae
 Not only this, ink was also thrown on Kumar's car
 kal kumaar par andey phenke gaye the (padhein khabar)
 It is being told that black flags were shown to AAP party leader Kumar Vishwas by the minority community today for his alleged anti-islamist remarks
 amethi ke raste main jagadishpur main pehle se jame alpsankhyak samudaay ke logon ne kaale jhande dikhaaye or ‘kumaar vishwaas waapas jaao, kumaar vishwaas hosh main aao, kumaar vishwaas murdaabaad’ ke naare lagaaye
 'his effigy was burnt by the protesters
 kal anda phenkane kii ghatana bhi vishwaas kii kathith islam virdohi tippaniyon ke virodh main hui bataai gai he
 However, Kumar Vishwas said that 'the paint that was thrown on our car outside Jagdishpur school, i wish that black paint would have been put on the broken blackboard of the same school!' Kumar, along with his supporters, reached a school in Jagdishpur where there was no proper roof nor blackboard of the way
 pradarshnakariyon se jab poocha gaya ki ve koun hai to unhone bataaya ki ve kisi raajnneetik party se jude hue nahin hai
 In this regard, Sanjay Singh of Aam Aadmi Party said that this could be a conspiracy of Congress
 kumaar vishwaas aaj amethi main janvishwaas raily karne vaale hai
 Amethi is considered the stronghold of Rahul Gandhi and this rally of Kumar Vishwas is going to directly challenge Rahul Gandhi
 vishwaas ne ravivaar subah twit kiya, 'chalo amethi! subah 8 baje kedy stadium, lakhanu se ravaanagi!!' ek anya twit main likhaa, 'vanshavaad, bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shankhanaad
 Thousands of companions ready on the path of revolution jai hind
 In another tweet, he welcomed former TV journalist Ashutosh and wrote, "swagat Bandhu on Kranti Path

 On the other hand, Ashutosh, who joined the Aam Aadmi Party, tweeted, "good morning, today i am going to Amethi for my first political rally
 ek patrkaar ke taur par to kai reliyaan cover kii, par raajnneetik kaaryakarta ke taur par yah pehali raily he
 Before the public trust rally of Kumara Vishwas, a political party had made full arrangements to spoil the flavor of the rally
 rashtravaadi party ke adhyaksh pratap chandra ne elaan kiya he tha ki ve virodh-pradarshan karenge, kyonki aam aadmi party ke varisht diggaj rashtradrohi hai
 However, people who showed black flags to Kumar Vishwas have not identified themselves with any party

 Asked if newly appointed minister Srikanth Jena should step down to maintain the state's reputation, Patnaik said, "I would not like to say anything on the new Minister of State
" unase hi puuchhen ki unhen kya karnaa chahie
 Jena has been a cabinet minister in the Deve Gowda government
 ve 3 baar vidhayak or 4 baar saansad rahe hai
 Meanwhile, senior Congress leader Narsingh Mitra said that giving Jena the post of Minister of State is like a very small position according to his stature

 The ambition of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to become the Prime Minister has not even started getting wings that another ambition has started in the state
 unke dipti siem tejasvi yadav ne siem ke samaantar pojishning shuru kar di he
 The special thing is that in the meantime, Nitish's face has also disappeared from the advertisements of Deputy cm's Ministries in newspapers
 patna ke sabhi akhabaaron main dipti siem ke mantralay path nirmaan vibhaag kaa vigyaapan surkhiyaan bator rahaa he
 Nitish Kumar's picture is missing from these advertisements which have been appearing continuously in the last two days
 in vigyapanon main sadakon ko lekarmukhyamantri ke sapanom kaa to zikrahai, lekin sirf tejasvi kii tasviir puure panne par chhaapi gai he
 Apparently it is being tried to show that Tejashwi Yadav is changing the picture of Bihar
 rajya se baahar hai nitishaargedy pramukh lalu prasad ke chote bete tejasvi ke nae tevar rajya kii raajnneeti main kautuhal kaa vishay ban gaya he
 Interestingly, Nitish himself is currently out of the state
 vah in dinon kerala ke chunavi daure par hai, jiske baad vah banaras kii do dinon kii raajnneetik yatra karenge
 There he will attend the Ganga Aarti along with President Pranab Mukherjee
 tejasvi ne diya SC ke aadesh kaa hawalatejasvi is photo ke peeche supreme court ke aadesh kaa hawala de rahe hai
 He says, "the opposition may find an issue in it, but it is according to the decision of the Supreme Court
" jisamen kaha gaya he ki siem kii tasviir unke kaarykram main hogi or mantriyon kii tasviir mantriyon ke kaarykram main
 When CM stays, he will have his picture
 isamen vipaksh naahak kii vivaad dekh rahaa he
 Preparing to fill the post after Nitish, however, political analysts are assuming that the real purpose is to fill the vacant mindspace in the state on the pretext of the picture
 nitish kumaar kii rashtriya mahatvakanksha ke baad rajya ke nae netritv ko lekar charchaa aam ho gai he
 It is understood that, sensing the opportunity, Lalu has started positioning and branding for Tejashwi
 vigyaapan kii puraani ranjishbihar main akhabaaron main chap rahe vigyaapan ko donon netaaon ke bich bad rahe vivaad se bhi jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 On several previous occasions, due to the picture, the two leaders had a sour problem
 patna ke ek bade sarkari aspataal ke kaarykram main tejpratap kii tasviir nahin hone se jab mantri ne apana kaarykram radd kiya, to puraa kaarykram hi radd karnaa padaa
 While at the inauguration of Patna Sahib Festival, when Deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav's picture was not printed, he distanced himself from the program
 jaankaar maanate hai ki nitish kumaar kii rashtriya mahatvakanksha ko lalu prasad apane liye maukey main badal dena chaahate hai
 In lieu of support, do not tell that Lalu has already supported Nitish as Prime Ministerial candidate
 vah kah chuke hai, 'chota bhai agar piem bane to bade bhai ko khushi hi hogi
 'apparently, Lalu will charge a price in lieu of naming Nitish as the PM candidate of the Third Front
 tejasvi kii branding sirf vigyapanon tak simit nahin he
 He is also inaugurating and laying the foundation stone of major road related projects
 jediu ko nahin dikh rahi samasyajediu ke pravaktaa ajay alok kehete hai, 'media isamen kuch zyada hi angal dekh rahaa he
 No need to see any angle
 dekhie supreme court ke nirnay ke anusaar koi bhi mantri, mukhyamantri ke aadesh k baad hshapani tasviir laga saktaahai
 It is clear that in this case too, this should have happened only after the order of Nitish Kumar
 'bijepi ne kaha- bad rahi he khaiudhar, bijepi ise lalu or nitish ke bich badhati khai ke rup me dekh rahe hai
 According to party leader Nandkishore Yadav, this is not the first case of cutting each other in advertisements in newspapers
 vah kehete hai, 'isse pehle bhi jab mukhyamantri ke chehre ke saath tejasvi kii photo nahin lagaai gai to tejasvi us kaarykram main nahin gaye
 If the photo of Health Minister Tej Pratap was not found, then the program itself had to be canceled, it is also part of the same link

 The central government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has decided to give 10% reservation to upper castes on economic basis
 aarthik rup se kamjor savarna logon ko sarkari naukariyon main 10 fisadi aarakshan diya jayega
 The government will come up with a proposal to amend the constitution on Tuesday and based on that reservation will be given
 darasal samvidhan ke vartmaan niyamon ke anusaar aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan dene kii raah kaaphi mushkil he
 What does the constitution say? According to the constitution, the scale of reservation is social inequality and reservation is not given on the basis of one's income and wealth
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 16(4) ke anusaar, aarakshan kisi samooh ko diya jaataa he or kisi vyakti ko nahin
 On this basis, in the past, the Supreme Court has several times stayed the decisions to give reservation on economic grounds
 apane faislon main supreme court ne kaha he ki aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan diya janaa samanta ke mul adhikaar kaa ulanghan he
 Who will get the benefit of 10% upper caste reservation, this is the category when has it been rejected? - In April 2016, the Gujarat government announced 10 percent reservation for economically backward people in the general category
 sarkaar ke is faisle ke anusaar 6 lakh rupee se kam vaarshik aay vaale pariwaron ko is aarakshan ke adheen laane kii baat kahi gai thi
 However, in August 2016, the High Court ruled it illegal and unconstitutional
 - sitambar 2015 main rajasthan sarkaar ne anarakshit varg ke aarthik pichhadon ko shaikshanik sansthaanon or sarkari naukariyon main 14 fisadi aarakshan dene kaa vaada kiya tha
 However, in December 2016, the Rajasthan High Court quashed this reservation bill
 aisa hi haryana main bhi hua tha
 After giving 27 percent reservation to backward in Bihar in 1978, then Chief Minister Karpoori Thakur gave three percent reservation to upper castes on economic grounds
 haalanki baad main court ne is vyavastha ko khatm kar diya
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, the Modi government's big announcement, the upper castes will get 10% reservation - Just after the Mandal Commission report came into force in 1991, former Prime Minister Narasimha Rao had given reservation on economic basis and arranged for 10% reservation
 haalanki 1992 main court ne use nirast kar diya tha
 What is the challenge before the government? Actually there are many challenges before the government to implement it, which will have to be overcome by amending the constitution
 pehali yah ki supreme court ne aarakshan kii seemaa 50 pratishat tay kar rakhi he or samvidhan main aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan dene kaa praavdhaan nahin he
 The second is that Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution deal only with being socially and educationally backward
 haalanki samvidhan main koi parivartan karne ke liye bhi sarkaar ke liye donon sadanon se bahumat praapt karnaa bhi mushkil kaa kaam hoga
 It is believed that the government can bring a bill in Parliament to provide a new category of reservation on economic grounds
 abhi kis ko kitna aarakshan?saal 1963 main supreme court ne kaha tha ki aamtaur par 50 fisadi se zyada aarakshan nahin diya ja saktaa he
 The backward classes are divided into three categories Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST) and Other Backward Classes (OBC)
 anusuchit jati (SC)- 15 %anusuchit janajati (ST)- 7
 5% Other Backward Classes (OBC) - 27% Total Reservation - 49

 or main ye dekhakar bhi hairaan hum ki kuch log ek ore se aap par pyaar barasaate hai to duusari ore yuva tak tebrist kii tarah pesh aate hai
 He wrote for Twitter that it changed the face of social media to a great extent but it could prove to be a better platform

 The atmosphere created after the CBI raid on Rajendra Kumar, Principal Secretary to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, can be called the biggest crisis for Arvind Kejriwal as a CM
 asal main kejariwal ke pradhan sachiv rajendra kumaar par sibiai karrwai or satarkta sachiv chetan sanghi par anti karpshan branch main hui FIR se dilli ke afasaron kaa manobal gira hua he, kyonki rajendra kumaar kejariwal ke sabase pasandida afasar the or un par karrwai kaa matlab ye mana ja rahaa he ki jo kejariwal ke saath dikhegaa us par karrwai ho sakati he
 In such a situation, the religious crisis of the officers is that they should listen to the CM they are working with or the Union Home Ministry, under which they come
 isliye aaj dilli iees afasar association siem kejariwal se mulaaqaat karegi or apni chintaaen zaahir karegi This news is important because the CBI action on Rajendra Kumar is afraid that the bureaucracy should not leave Kejriwal with him
 agar aisa hua to kejariwal ke liye ye sarkaar main aane ke baad kaa ab tak kaa sabase bada sankat ho jayega, kyonki bina afasaron ke sahyog ke koi bhi sarkaar kaam to jaise kar leti he, lekin vaisaa pradarshan nahin kar sakati, jiskaa vaada karke kejariwal satta main aae
 This is the biggest problem of the Delhi government at this time
 guruuvar ko dilli ke grih mantri satyendra jain ne bhi kaha ki jis tarah se afasaron kaa daraaya ja rahaa he usase unka manobal gir rahaa he, agar centre sarkaar kahe to ham dandavat hone ko taiyaar hai bas hamen kaam karne den

 After the Muzaffarnagar riots in UP, the troubles of the Akhilesh Yadav government are steadily increasing rather than diminishing

 Praveen Kumar's sudden increase in blood pressure is believed to be the real cause of eye strain caused by political interference after the violence in Muzaffarnagar
 mujffarnagar ke esaspi ke taur par kaamkaaj sambhalate hi praveen kumaar danga prabhavit ilaakon kii asaliyat se waakif ho gaye the
 This was the reason that he had recommended before the Akhilesh Yadav government to conduct a CBI or CBCID investigation into the incident in Kawal village of Muzaffarnagar
 shashan ko bheji gai report main esaspi ne dange main hui farji naamajadagiyon ko bhi ingit kiya tha
 Due to the failure of the government to send a favorable report, he started knocking the big officers sitting in Lucknow

 An IG level officer posted at the police headquarters in Lucknow says that due to the high pressure, SSP Praveen Kumar has complained of high blood pressure and had to go on 'medical leave'
 haalanki vibhageeya sutara ki praveen kumaar ko 'force live' par bheja gaya he
 Reddening of the eye due to increased blood pressure is not such a big disease, which requires hospitalization like AIIMS

 Wanted ''meri aisi ichha jaanakar ve donon bahut khush or prabhavit bhi hue
 He told me that there is a lot of pressure on us from the Ministry of Home Affairs to quickly catch those who shot Phoolan Devi and we suspect that you were also among the masked shooters
 maine kaha ki sar, agar main car ki main nahin tha to
 He said that you have nothing to say now because we love our job more than you, but still because you have done good social work before and you want to do patriotic work in the future, so we will have your press conference here in Dalanwala police station Let's get you one thing told by us

 Saheb got me in his Pizero car and reached Delhi at around 12 o'clock at night and took him to the office of his Crime Branch
 agle din mujhe court main pesh karke mujhe remand par poochtacha ke liye le liya
 On remand, the police asked me that now the judge will decide whether you killed Phoolan or not, but whoever killed him was okay because he had killed more than a hundred people in his life without any reason
 
 jin logon kaa yah kahana he ki phulan ke upar baat atyaachaar hue the or uskaa badla lene ke liye vah daaku bani or logon kii hatyaein kii, yah baat maananaa or logon kaa aisa sochna ekadam galat he
 i told him that Sir, Phoolan Devi herself had gone to live with the dacoits on her own and if those dacoits had sex with Phoolan then it was the atmosphere of them and every gang of dacoits in their gang got 3-4 women He used to keep it so that he could celebrate with them, because the bandits lived in ravines all the time
 ye auraten giroh kaa khaanaa banane main bhi madad karti thim
 Therefore every gang used to keep a woman in their gang as per their requirement
 jis giroh main phulan devi thi, us gang ke mukhiya do sage bhai the, jinka naam shriram or lalaram tha
 Phoolan Devi states that she was raped and tortured by Sriram and Lalaram
 agar phulan devi kii yah baat maan lee jaae to phulan devi ko in donon bhaaiyon ko markar apane upar hue atyaachaar kaa badla lenaa chahie tha or agar phulan inhen maarthi to main phulan kaa sabase bada samarthak hota, kyonki tab yah sach main bahaduree hoti he ki jisane aapke upar julm kiya, aapane use sabak sikhaaya
 But Phoolan never killed these two brothers
 phulan devi ne behamai gaanv main jin 22 logon kii hatya apane gang ke saath milakar kii, unki sirf yah galati thi ki is gaanv ke ek aadmi ne apane ghar kii shaadi ke samaaroh main in donon dakait bhaaiyon kaa nyauta de diya tha
 And these 22 people were also involved in that wedding ceremony
 in 22 marane waalon ko to yah bhi nahin pataa hoga ki vah kyon mar rahe hai? agar phulan us nyauta dene vaale aadmi ko maarthi tab bhi phulan kii baat thodi sahi maani ja sakati ki jo bhi hamaare virdohi kaa saath degaa, use ham nuksaan pahunchaayenge
 But these poor 22 people had no far-reaching mistake
 phulan yaa logon kaa yah kahana he ki jab phulan ke saath rape hua to in gaanv waalon ne use kyon nahin bachaaya to is baat par meraa yah kahana he ki agar ve itane bahadur hote ki kisi ko daakuon se bachaa saken to apane ko marane se hi na bachaa lete
 Apart from this, Phoolan carried out the Pachisi robbery and at the time of every robbery, he committed 2-3 murders in money greed to always dominate his gang
 phulan ke dushman shriram or lalram rajput the, isliye phulan ne khuleam kaha ki main puri dharti se sabhi kshatriyon ko maar kar khatm kar duungi
 No one asks Phoolan Devi why the entire society will suffer due to the mistake of two people, who have put everything in the service of this country
 baad main jab phulan ne aatmasamarpan kiya to us samay shri arjuna singh madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri the or inhen ke saamne phulan ne aatm-samarpan kiya
 Shri Arjun Singh himself was a Rajput leader
 agar phulan ko rajputon se itani ghrinaa thi to shri arjuna singh ke saamne samarpan kyon kiya? sirf isliye ki arjuna singh ne phulan kii sabhi nazaij sharten maan lee thim or in sharton ke mutabik phulan ko samarpan ke evaj main khub sari jameen-jaaydaad sarkaar de rahi thi, jo ki phulan ke jivan kaa makasad tha ki kaise zyada-se-zyada rupaya kamaaya ja saktaa tha or isi laalach ke kaaran vah dakait bani thi or jab us dhan ke laalach kii purti samarpan se hoti dikhi to samarpan kar diya
 If she hated Shri Ram Lalaram so much that she killed more than a hundred people in that hatred, then when she had the power after becoming an MP, why not help her and her gang get eliminated with the help of the police? Just because she had nothing to do with enmity, because her motive was just money, which she earned by putting in a lot of robberies even when she was a dacoit and still while she was an MP
 kam-se-kam 20 karod se bhi zyada kii property phulan ne saansad banane ke baad galat tareeke se kama lee or jin pichhadi jatiyon kii sahaayta karne kaa vaada karke vah chunaav jiti thi, unhen bhul gai or yaad rahaa to sirf paisa
 Just money, which was everything to him
 phulan devi ke bare main mere vichaar jaanane ke baad mere saamne baithe pulisavaalon ne bhi meri baat par apni sahmati dikhaai or unamem se ek bolaa ki kya ajeeb baat he ki 1982 main hamaare jaise kitne hi police waalon ne phulan ko jinda yaa murda pakadaaey ke liye raat-din ek kiya hua hoga taaki phulan ko jinda yaa murda pakadaaey par 50 hajaar kaa jo inaam sarkaar ne rakhaa tha, vah hasil kar saken or aaj jab kisi ne use maar diya he to use inaam dene kii jagah pakadakar jail bhejnaa pad rahaa he
 xxrep 5 * Then an officer gave me the Hindustan Times of English, in which it was published that after Phoolan died in Uttar Pradesh's Jalaun district, people celebrated by firing bullets in the air and about 20 years of the Behmai incident
 Later the festival of Diwali will be celebrated in the area
 puure uttar pradesh main phulan ke marane ke uplakshya main jagah-jagah khushiyaan manaane kii khabaren bhi chhapi thim
 xxrep 5 * The jailor told me that you must have taken one or two crores to kill Phoolan
 maine kaha ki sar, main paison ke laalach main kaam karne vaala aadmi nahin
 i am a patriotic man, and a man who works for my country and society by spending money from his house, i am not a cock to do good to you, but i will do something with my desire for you later , Because you do my work as i said
 xxrep 5 * agle din mujhe court main pesh ki yaa to meri mata ji 100-200 rajput sabha ke logon ke saath court ke baahar hi milin
 Inside the court room, after taking the orders of the judge, my mother started talking to me and started hugging and crying, due to which i also got tears in my eyes
 meri mataji ne mujhe bataaya ki tumhaare pitaaji kaa antim sanskaar tumhaare taoojee ke ladke ko karnaa padaa tha, kyonki tumhaare donon bhaaiyon ko parole nahin mil pai thi or yah baat maine tumhen pehle isliye nahin bataai thi, kyonki main nahin chaahati thi ki tum gusse yaa pareshaani main koi galat kadam uthaakar apane asli makasad se bhatko

 Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said on Sunday that Kashmir is the main dispute between India and Pakistan
 ise hal kiye bina kshetra main shanti or logon kii samruddhi ke sapane ko saakaar karnaa mushkil hoga
 Describing the Kashmir issue as the unfinished agenda of partition and the oldest issue of dispute in the UN Security Council, Sharif said that for the last seven decades India has been denying the right to self-determination to the people of Kashmir
 jiskaa unase suraksha parishad ke kai prastaavon ke jariye antarrashtriya samudaay dwaara vaada kiya tha
 Nawaz Sharif said this while speaking on the occasion of Kashmir Solidarity Day
 bekasoor kashmiri logon kii hatyaon kii nindasharif ne kahaaki pakistan ke log aaj kashmir ekajutata diwas ko manaane ke liye apane kashmiri bhaaiyon or bahanon ke saath shaamil hue hai
 Which reaffirms our moral, diplomatic and political support to the Kashmiri people for their legal struggle for basic human rights, especially the right to self-determination established through several resolutions of the UN Security Council
 unhone kaha, pakistan sarkaar dwaara vyavasthaagat rup pryojit aatankwaad or bhartiya balon dwaara bekasoor kashmiri logon kii nirmam hatyaon kii ninda karata he
 The Pakistani Prime Minister said, "all the excesses of India have failed to stop the Kashmiri people from the goal of their freedom from the oppression of India
" kashmir kaa hal nikaale bina shanti kaa mudda adhoorasharif ne kaha kipakistaiantarrashtriya samudaay kaa aahvaan karata he ki vah kashmir main bhartiya balon dwaara kiye ja rahe maanavadhikaron ke gambhir ulanghan ko khatm karne or iske dwaara 70 saal pehle jammu kashmir ke logon se kiye gaye vaade ko puraa karne ke liye apni aawaaj uthaaen

 bharat ke purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi kii 1991 main hatya hone se paanch saal pehle hi america central intelligence agency (CIA) ne is par ek report taiyaar kii thi
 The CIA, in preparing this very detailed and exhaustive report, had imagined what would happen if Rajiv Gandhi was killed or if he suddenly left the political scene
 'rajeev ke baad bharat' sheershak vaali 23 pannon kii is report ko march 1986 main duusare varisht siie adhikariyon kii tippaniyon ke liye unke saamne rakhaa gaya tha
 The CIA recently made this report public
 haalanki is report ke kuch hisson ko hataa diya gaya he
 Rajiv will have a fatal attack on him as PM: CIA The full title of this report is not available, because parts of it have been removed
 is report ko janvari 1986 tak siie ke paas uplabdh jaankariyon ke aadhaar par taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 The first line of the available report (not deleted) states that Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi will be attacked at least once before his term ends in 1989, which is expected to succeed
 usne baad main saaf taur se kaha, nikat bhavishya main unki hatya hone kaa bada khatra he
 Five years later, Gandhi was assassinated on 21 May 1991 at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu
 rajeev ke jane par halaat kaa jaaydis report main is baat kaa vishleshan or vichaar vimarsh kiya gaya he ki rajeev gandhi ke nahin hone par agar netritv main achaanak badlaav hota he, to gharelu or antarrashtriya raajnneetik sthiti main kya paridrishy saamne aane kii sambhaavna he or iskaa america, tatkaaleen soviet sangh or kshetra ke saath bharat ke sambandhon par kya prabhaav pad saktaa he
 Anticipating riots after Rajiv's assassination, the US intelligence agency reported the threat to Rajiv's life from various extremist groups at the time and feared his assassination
 isamen kaha gaya he, agar koi sikh yaa kashmiri muslim gandhi kii hatya karata he, to bharat ke raashtrapati dwaara uttari bharat main sena evam addhasainya balon kii tainaati samet majboot suraksha kadam uthaae jane ke baavjood vyapak str par sampradayik hinsa fail sakati he
 Narasimha Rao and VP Singh are also interesting to mention, this report also mentions PV Narasimha Rao and VP Singh, who may take over as interim or possible candidates after Rajiv's sudden departure
 raav ne 1991 main pradhanmantri ke rup main kaarybhaar sambhala tha
 In the section titled 'danger of Murder: Stability at Risk', it is likely that extremist Sikhs or disgruntled Kashmiri Muslims are expected to assassinate Rajiv in the coming years
 inke alaava koi kattar hindu bhi unhen nishaanaa bana saktaa he
 The report did not address the mention of LTTE since a significant portion of this section of the report has been removed, so it could not be clear whether Sri Lankan Tamil fundamentalists were mentioned in the analysis
 ek anya khand main haalanki ugravadi srilankai tamilon or sinhalai varchasv vaali colombo kii sarkaar ke bich ke vivaad ke samaadhaan ko lekar rajeev kii madhyastata se judi koshishon ke bare main vistrut or gaharaai main baat kii gai he
 Apart from anticipating the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, the report also analyzes various political scenarios likely to arise in the event of his sudden departure from India's political scene before 1989
 report main kaha gaya he, haalanki ham maanate hai ki nikat bhavishya main hatya ke kaaran rajeev kaa kaarykaal samaapt ho saktaa he, lekin kai anya baaten bhi varsh 1989 se pehle unke achaanak raajnneetik patal se hatane kaa kaarak ban sakati hai
 There was also a presumption of Rajiv's resignation from the post of PM, in this report it is also said that Rajiv may be killed in a natural way or in an accident
 iske alaava bhi kai anya kaarak bataae gaye hai
 The US agency's report denied any possibility of his resentment and decision to resign
 report main kaha gaya he, ham iskaa koi sanket nahin dekh rahe hai or yakeen maaniye aisa unke swabhaav ke vipareet hoga
 It also states, "we fear that Rajiv may have been speculating (as we are speculating) that even if he leaves the public office, he and his family will remain targets of radical violence
" rajeev ke jane kaa america se rishton par asar kaa andeshasiaie kii report ke america par prabhaav sheershak khand main kaha gaya he, hamaara maananaa he ki rajeev kii maut se america hiton ko bahut adhik jhatka lagegaa
 The report also states that we believe that india-us relations will also be affected due to changes in domestic politics after Rajiv's assassination
 report main kattarpathiyon se nipatane, duusare deshon ke saath sambandhon (srilanka ke tamil mudde samet), chuninda videshi praudyogikiyon ke adhigrahan ko badhaava dene samet kai muddon par rajeev kii nitiyon or unke parinaam kaa akalan kiya gaya he
 The report said that although the policies of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi will be strongly opposed during the next few years, we believe that barring death, he will continue to dominate Indian politics till the present term of December 1989
 siie kii report main rajeev ke achaanak bhartiya raajnneetik paridrishy se hatane kii sthiti main ek rashtriya sarkaar ke sthaan lene kii sambhaavna ke bare main kaha gaya he
 The report, however, ruled out the possibility of military rule under any such circumstances

 Ishant Sharma, who has faced a match ban due to his aggressive behavior in Sri Lanka, has said that he is not even thinking about that now
 pratibandh kii vajah se mohali test main nahin khel sake eshanth ne kaha he ki wo bhavishya par dhyaan dena chaahate hai
 He said, 'many times in life we look back and remember old things and think that if i did or not i would have done things differently
 iskaa koi jawaab nahin hota he
 When i was banned for the Mohali Test, i decided that i would not look back
 srilanka main jo kuch hua vah beeti baat he or main us bare main nahin sochna chahta
 Where the fight started in Sri Lanka, Ishant had to face criticism from many former cricketers due to his anger during the Sri Lankan tour
 is daure main unki dhammika prasad ke saath jhadap bhi hui thi
 Ishant said, 'dhammika Prasad was doing a bouncer for me
 ek over main aap keval do bounsar kar sakate ho lekin usne teesraa bhi kiya
 i knew that he was doing this because i put him on my hand while bowling
 ’unhone kaha, ‘jo bhi ho jab usne teesraa bounsar kiya to maine usase keval itnaa kaha ki tum itani dhimi gend karte ho ki mere helmet par laga sako
 He became angry and other Sri Lankan players also supported him
 yahaan se maamla garmaya or jab main gendbaaji ke liye aayaa to tab uskaa prabhaav padaa
 Ishant said, "being a fast bowler, you have to do something to keep yourself energetic and achieve something
 mere liye vah aisa hi pal tha
 i know that many people would think that what i did was very wrong because i was banned
 mujh par prasad ke saath jhadap ke kaaran pratibandh nahin laga, jiske liye ki sabhi meri aalochana kar rahe the
 i was banned because i went to the batsman to celebrate after he was dismissed
 isaki anumati nahin he
 It happened in excitement
 ’ran ap chota kiyabehatar gendbaaj banane ke liye apni takanic main kiye gaye badlaavon ke bare main eshanth ne kaha ki vah ab adhik gendbaaji or chote ran ap se gendbaaji karne par dhyaan de rahe hai
 He said, 'I didn't do a lot of work on my bowling
 main keval adhik gendbaaji kar rahaa hum
 Everyone says that fast bowlers will not get wickets in Asia and the pitches here are favorable to spinners
 lekin kuch aise daur hote hai jabaki kuch nahin hota or wicket aasaani se nahin milte
 Then as a fast bowler you have to tell yourself that i have to take a wicket for my captain
 iske liye aapako aatmavishvaas kii jarurat padati he
 i achieved this by bowling more of mine
 ’eshanth ne kaha, ‘maine apane ran ap ko thodaa chota kiya kyonki jab main daudta tha to sahaj mahasoos nahin karata tha
 Something was missing
 main kai no ball bhi kar rahaa tha
 After shortening the run up i feel more comfortable and the number of no balls has also decreased
 jab aap apane ran ap main sahaj mahasoos karte ho to aapaki gendbaaji kii lay main khud hi sudhaar hota he

 In such a situation, if we stop the time machine by taking it back to the initial moment, then the whole universe will be just like a point
 yahi vajah he ki mahaprayog ke liye bhi usee maahaul kii jarurat padi jo bigbeng ke vakt rahaa hoga
 But it is not so easy to do all this

 The Tibet government held a 3-day special general meeting
 345 such delegates from 24 countries attended this meeting
 Before the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to India, the exiled Tibetan government held a three-day special general meeting in Dharamshala
 is baithak main 24 deshon ke 345 aise pratinidhi shaamil hue jo dharmik tibeti netaa hai
 In it, it is stated in the pass proposal that the Dalai Lama will decide for himself ‘rebirth’ i
e
 the successor
 shanivaar ko dalai lamas ke punarjanm jaise mahatvapurn masale par sarvasammati se chaar prastaav paas kiye gaye
 Speaking to India Today after this meeting, President of the exiled Tibet government, Lobsang Sangye said that China has no right to decide on the issue of 'rebirth', so the Communist Party of China should not interfere in the matter of religion 
 dalai lamas ke punarjanm ke liye prastaavlobsang sangye ne kaha, 'hamane prastaav paas kiya he ki china sarkaar ne 2007 main punarjanm ko lekar jo dastavej number paanch jari kiya tha, vah hamen sweekaar nahin he
 China has no credibility to interfere with the regeneration process
 china sarkaar ke dastavej number paanch main kaha gaya he ki communist party jila str, rajya str or rashtriya str par padanukram or unki shreniyon ke anusaar punarjanm kii manyata kaa faisla karegi
 He further said, 'the Communist Party should not interfere in religious matters
 jahaan tak dalai lamas ke punarjanm kii baat he to is par faisla sirf or sirf dalai lamas hi lenge, koi or nahin
 'this discussion revolved around two themes, the Vision 550 of the Central Tibetan Administration and the Dalai Lama's relationship with the Tibetan people
 tibeti sarkaar kii sansad main spikar or dipti spikar ne in prastaavon ko sarvasammati se paas kar diya
 What does the proposal say? The first proposal was about the long and healthy life of the Dalai Lama, in which the Tibetan people expressed their gratitude to the Dalai Lama
 doosraa prastaav kahata he ki punarjanm kii prakriya tab tak jari rahegi, jab tak is duniya main tibetiyon kaa vajood rahegaa
 The third resolution stated that the authority of the Dalai Lama and his office would remain
 chauthe prastaav main kaha gaya ki sabhi sadsy china sarkaar ke 2007 ke aadesh number paanch ko sarvasammati se khaarij karte hai
 China has been saying that the next incarnation of the Dalai Lama will be in Tibet
 lekin puri duniya main rah rahe tibeti samudaay kaa kahana he ki dalai lamas kaa avataran kahin bhi ho saktaa he, kyonki china sarkaar dalai lamas ke naam par koi kathpu tali netaa niyukt kar sakati he
 President Sangye, the government of the Dalai Lama who has been granted religious freedom, said, "his Holiness the Lama has made it clear that he will be reborn in a free country where the Dalai Lama has religious freedom
" ham mahasoos karte hai ki dalai lamas kaa punarjanm china main nahin ho saktaa he, jahaan par buddha dharm ko hatotsahit kiya gaya or monastries ko nasht kar diya gaya
 When questioned about the convening of this meeting just before the Chinese President's visit to India, the exiled government chief said that it was just a coincidence
 president sangye ne kaha, 'yah ittefaq he ki nirvasit tibet sarkaar kii aam sabha ke thik baad china ke raashtrapati bharat aa rahe hai
 We had decided this meeting in February itself
 hamaara sandesh saaf he ki china kii sarkaar ko dalai lamas samet dharmik netaaon ke maamalon main dakhal nahin dena chahie
 On the question of hoping for a solution on the issue of Tibet, he said, 'we would like to see a solution to the issue of Tibet
 bich kaa rasta apanaate hue ham chini samvidhan ke dhaanche ke tahat vaastavik swaittata chaahate hai
 It will also be a win-win situation for the Chinese government and the people of Tibet
 yah bich kaa rasta he or china sarkaar ko tibet maamle kaa shantipurna samaadhaan karne ke liye is par vichaar karnaa chahie

 The police has disclosed the case of the murder of BJP leader Krishna Shahi in Bihar
 bijepi netaa ke kareebi aditya raay ne hi is vaardaat ko anjaam diya tha

 Police on Wednesday recovered the body of BJP leader Krishna Shahi from a well in Gopalganj
 is sambandh main police ne netaa ke kareebi aditya raay ko giraftaar kiya tha
 During the police interrogation, Aditya Rai confessed his crime
 raay ne police ko bataaya ki krishna ke uski bahan se avaidh sambandh the
 Rai further said, when Krishna came to his house in the past, he was talking to his sister on the phone
 usne donon kii baatcheet sun lee thi
 Both were supposed to meet at Aditya's house at 12 pm
 jiske baad aditya ne krishna ko maarane kaa plan banaaya
 Aditya bought poison from the pesticide shop
 raat 12 baje krishna aditya ke ghar pahunchaa
 When Aditya opened the door, Krishna pretended to come to his house late at night, pretending to be quarreling with the police
 police ke chaape ke dar se usne raat main vahiin rukne kii baat kahi
 After this, Aditya served poisoned food to Krishna
 jise khaane ke baad krishna baichaiyn hokar baahar bhaagane laga or paas hi ke ek kune main gir gaya
 After the accused's Iqbal-e-crime, the police have committed murder against him
 philhal maamle kii jaanch jari he
 What was the matter In the past, the body of BJP leader Krishna Shahi was found by a well in Gopalganj
 jiske baad police ne mritak netaa ke ek kareebi aditya raay or chaar mahilaon ko hiraasat main liya tha
 The deceased leader had been missing since Aditya went home
 shahi ke bhai ne is maamle main vidhayak pappu pandey kaa haath hona bataaya tha
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's statement made the situation quite clear amid the glorification of the alliance between the Aam Aadmi Party and Congress in the Lok Sabha elections in Delhi
 mangalvaar ko purvi dilli ke lakshmi nagar main aam aadmi party kii ummidavaar aatishi ke liye vot maangane pahunche kejariwal ne jansabha ke baad media ke sawaal jawaab dete hue kaha ki mujhe mili aadhikarik jaankaree ke mutabik, congress gathbandhan ke liye manaa kar chuki he
 Arvind Kejriwal further said that what is his (congress's) daily meeting going on, what do we have to do with it? The Congress has officially told us that there is no alliance and we are not talking to them
 roj congress story plant kar rahi he
 Meanwhile, Aaj Tak asked Aam Aadmi Party's Delhi convenor Gopal Rai about an alliance with the Congress, will there be an alliance with the Congress in Delhi? Did the Congress agree to negotiate, even then the Aam Aadmi Party will not have an alliance? Gopal Rai replied that there will be no alliance with the Congress
 congress gambhir nahin he, or ab gathbandhan ke bare main sochane kaa matlab he ki chunaav haarana
 Every day is coming to an end
 congress ke rashtriya adhyaksh dilli or pradesh adhyaksh dilli main rahete hai, iske baavjood aapas main chitthee-chitthee khel rahe hai
 It is clear that Congress is not serious about fighting in Delhi
 itani baatcheet ke baad log bhi bol rahe hai ki kitni baat karoge
 The Congress knows that it cannot win elections in Delhi but can only win the BJP
 aage gopal raay se poocha gaya ki kya ab congress se gathbandhan kii koi gunjaaish nahin he? raay ne jawaab diya "aam aadmi party ne tay kiya he ki saaton seat par ummidavaar chunaav ladenge or akele dam par bijepi ko haraayenge
 The Aam Aadmi Party will start its campaign from 23 March
 gathbandhan kii tamaam charchaaon par ab viraam lag gaya he
 "aajtak" asked Gopal Rai as to why the alliance talks failed, and he said "congress is not serious in Delhi, a section of Congress wants to benefit BJP
" lekin ab itani der ho chuki he ki gathbandhan bhi ho gaya to chunaav haar jaaenge
 "rai was also asked whether the Aam Aadmi Party would discuss if a proposal from the Congress came forward on the alliance? Gopal Rai said that" We will not discuss anything, it is too late
 " ab dilli main gathbandhan nahin hoga
 "let me tell you that elections are going to be held in Delhi on May 12
 dilli kii saaton seat par aam aadmi party ne ummidavaar ghoshit kar die hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party has made a demand for full statehood in the Lok Sabha elections

 The Prime Minister said in a statement, "I am happy that the representatives of the government and civil society have reached an agreement in our mutual resolve to fight corruption
" main is baat se khush hum ki anna hajaare anshan samaapt karne par raji ho gaye hai
 Manmohan said, joining hands of civil society and government on this historic bill is an auspicious sign for our democracy
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar or hajaare ke pratinidhiyon ke bich vaarta faldaai rahi
 The Prime Minister said, "I hope that the process of drafting this bill will proceed constructively, so that after extensive deliberations, the Bill is placed before the Cabinet for presentation in the Monsoon Session
" faisal devjigandhi agar aaj bhi hamaare bich maujuud hai to iskaa shrey keval or keval unke aalochakon ko jaataa he, jo unhen vismrit hi nahin hone dete
 The followers of the Mahatma have made him a saint whose teachings can be easily ignored — like the words of an elder are praised from far and wide
 bharat main unhen die jane vaale aanushthanik sammaan or saarvajanik jivan main unke prati upeksha ke bhav ko dekhte hue yah hairaani kii baat he ki aakhir apane aalochakon ke bich gandhi itane jivit vyaktitv kyon hai
 These critics are probably those who feel betrayed by their lack of saintliness
 vidwaanon or andolankariyon ke mahatma kii koi na koi nai vifaltaa dhund nikaalane ke saath hi dhokhaa khaane kaa yah bhav har peedi main nayaa ho jaataa he
 During the second wave of feminism in the 1980s, she was blown away by her views about women
 unki is aalochana kaa aadhaar patni kasturba gandhi ke saath unke bartaav or brahmacharya ke prayogon main yuva mahilaon ke saath unke nagn sone kii kahaniyaan thim
 But the voice of these women is strangely suppressed
 gandhi ke prayogon kii bhagidaar rahi manuben ne ek diary likh chodi he, lekin kisi bhi aalochak ne use padhgaye kii jahamat nahin uthaai
 Though his attitude towards his close people was sometimes harsh, it is also true that many women close to him, such as Anasuya Sarabhai, Mridula Sarabhai, Amrit Kaur, Sarojini Naidu and Sushila Nayyar, entered public life
 1990 ke dashak main jab mandal ayog ne bharat main jati sangharsh ko punerjeevit kiya to logon kaa dhyaan gandhi ke jatigat purvagrahon par gaya tha
 But, against Gandhi in this order b
 aar
 Not much work was done to remind me of Ambedkar's literal attacks
 yahaan bhi aalochakon ne puna pact ke bare main prachlit kathaon par vichaar manthan shuru kiya ki kaise gandhi ne nichi jatiyon ke liye alag nirvachan vyavastha kaa virodh karte hue upwas shuru kar diya tha or kaise in jatiyon kii durdasha khatm karne ko lekar unhen koi chintaa nahin thi
 It is a different matter that the Poona Pact was not merely a caste issue, but an issue arising out of alliances between Muslims, Dalits and others who denied the existence of a nation in India
 mahatma ke aalochak bharat main raashtra kii anupasthiti ke bare main mohammad ali jinna or ambedkar ke vichaaron se to sahamat ho sakate hai, lekin ve un vajahon par dhyaan dene se inkaar karte hai jinke aadhaar par gandhi ne jati kaa samarthan kiya
 As an anarchist, the Mahatma was skeptical of his efforts towards reconstructing the society as expected of the then state system and colonial system
 unako lagata tha ki agar swaraj yaa swashaasan ko rajyatantr, jise bharatiyon par koi rashtriya pahchaan thopane nahin diya ja saktaa, ke baahar hi janm lenaa ho to us sthiti main jati, gaanv or dharmik samudaay mahatvapurn honge
 For this reason, instead of rejecting such systems, it was necessary to reform them and due to these ideas, Gandhi remained conservative rather than revolutionary
 ambedkar kii gandhi se asahmati is tark ke saath shuru hui ki rajya main samaaj ko badalane kii purna shakti he or isi vajah se unhone jawaharlal nehru se haath milaayaa
 But he soon realized the excesses and limitations of such power and resigned from the cabinet and focused on promoting social change from the religious point of view
 unka yah kadam gandhi ke hi tareeke kii yaad dilaataa he
 Ambedkar never abandoned the firm concept of the Mahatma's Satyagraha, despite the apparent hatred of Gandhi for challenging Ambedkar to back him during the Poona Pact, forcing him to retreat
 agar gandhi ke nariwadi shatru striyon kii aawaaj dabaate hai to jati ke bare main unke vichaaron ke kaaran bane shatru ise shuddh hindu bahes banaae rakhane ke liye isamen musalamaanon kii bhoomika khatm kar dete hai—rashtriyata tathaa pratinidhitiv ke muddon par ambedkar ke kai tark thik vahi hai jo jinna ke the
 If Gandhi's same attitude towards Ambedkar is adopted, then his views on 'backward' tribals and 'staunch' Muslims, who were against being given separate representation, would seem more reactive
 ambedkar ko lagata tha ki daliton ke liye alag pratinidhitiv hasil karne ke unke prayaason ko daliton kii keemat par muslim lig kii congress se samjhauta karne kii ichha se nuksaan pahunchaa
 The same damage was done by promoting tribal representation on the part of the colonial state to divide Indian politics
 gandhi ke jeevankaal main unke shatru unke viruddh jin tarkon ko khadaa karte the ve rajnatik hote the, na ki vyaktigat
 He saw the Mahatma as being anti-muslim or anti-hindu, refuting the fictional evidence of more complex statements
 yahaan tak ki gandhi ke hatyare ne bhi unki nishchhalata ko sweekaar karte hue hinduon ke saath unki kathith dagabaaji ko dakshin africa main bhartiya samudaay ko ekajute karne main mili safalataa ko dohraane ke prayaas main gharelu paristhitiyon ko thik se na samaj paanaa mana tha
 The communists' view of Gandhi as a capitalist hound was complex, citing Marx's principles associated with the development of class struggle
 aupniveshik adhikariyon ne apusht kathaon or nijee maamalon ke sahare aalochana kii style shuru kii, jo gandhi ke shatruon kii visheshta ban gai
 Instead of accusing the Mahatma of any particular crime, he used to describe his actions and every thing as extreme hypocrisy
 paakhand par dhyaan kendrit karnaa gandhi ke shabdon or kaaryon ko rajnatik vichaardhaara ke rup main samajhane kii prakriya ko aadhe-adhure uddharanon or shadyantron ke madhyam se mahatvaheen banane kii chhot detaa tha
 It is a symptom of the ultra-right process of understanding history and indicates the collusion of left-wing critics with them
 ye vividh or paraspar virodhabhasi nindaayen hamen un logon ke bare main adhik bataati hai jo inkaa srijan karte hai banisbat uske jiske bare main ve hoti hai
 Gandhi has become the source from which every generation of Indians can discover the consequences of their social and political concerns
 is rup main ve nishchay hi raashtra ke pita hai
 It is not surprising then that with the worldwide resurgence of Gandhi, he is now facing accusations of racism of which Indians are no longer victims, but have become agents
 haalanki gandhi ke naslwad kii bharsana ke bare main abhootpurv yah he ki aisa bharat tak hi simit nahin he balki vaishvik str par ho rahaa he jiske parinamswaroop africa ke kai hisson main mahatma kii murtiyon par hamalaa hua he yaa unhen hataa diya gaya he
 Two charges are made against Gandhi
 yah ki unhone africaiyon kii swatantraaa ke liye kabhi koi baat nahin kii yaa unhen apane andolanon se alag rakhaa
 And, that they considered Africans inferior and wanted to keep Indians away from them
 lekin, bina aamantran mahatma ne kabhi bhi kisi aise kisi samudaay ke liye baat nahin kii, jiske ve sadsy nahin the
 This is because he imagined non-violence as exemplary behavior rather than didactic talk that could be imitated to maintain anarchist social plurality
 gandhi ke daur kaa dakshin africa samaaj aisa tha jisamen alag-alag naslon ke logon ke liye alag kanoon the
 As a lawyer defending Indian privileges, he was unable to challenge that legal system
 or, vahaan ke kanoon ne bhi bharatiyon or africaiyon kii pahchaan alag-alag karte hue sunishchit kar rakhaa tha ki ve keval bharatiyon ke visheshadhikaron kaa bachaav kar saken
 However, it is possible that they too have accepted this racial segregation as correct or accepted it
 phir bhi, bambatha vidroh ke samay ve jis ambulance kor kaa netritv kar rahe the usamen unhone ghayal zulu logon kaa bhi ilaaj kiye jane par jor diya tha or unki rajnatik sahanubhuti zulu logon ke saath thi, britain ke nahin
 When he was no longer a lawyer, he stopped making derogatory remarks about Africans
 apni pustak dakshin africa main satyagrah main unhone har lihaaj se bharatiyon kii tulana main zulu logon kaa paksh liya he
 Finally, he also saw african-americans as the greatest hope of representing non-violence worldwide
 lekin kanoonee sthiti ko dekhte hue, mahatma ko apane hamawatan bharatiyon ke liye laduya tha
 Their demands were international rather than limited to South Africa, which obliged India to protect the status of its citizens everywhere in the British Empire
 haalanki unhone khud bhi aisa kaha he, lekin mahatma ke pehle satyagrah ko dakshin africa satyagrah kahana bhraamak he, kyonki iskaa sidhaa prabhaav bharat par or phir landan par padataa tha
 South Africa was merely a site in the conflict in which Gandhi was interested in Indians in the entire British Empire from Kenya to Mauritius, Guyana, Fiji and Trinidad
 jab unhone chaha to yah vaishvik andolan bana or vastav main samrajya ke adhikansh hisson main mazdooron kii aapurti ke liye africa das pratha kii uttaradhikari jaisi bharat se theke par majdoor le jane kii pratha ko khatm karaane main safal rahaa
 Despite all this, perhaps Gandhi was racist, but we do not know of his enemies who obstruct the entirety of his ideas by having personal and often conspiratorial arguments against him, and many ignore the contexts in which he worked
 yahaan tak ki hitler par bhi naslwad kaa aarope lagaana nirarthak baat he, kyonki ham uski hinsa ko keval tab samaj sakate hai jab usase jude bauddhik auchity or aitihaasik sandarbhon ko dhyaan main rakhen
 Instead of turning the saint into a sinner, it is time for both Mahatma's friends and enemies to make him a properly historical figure
