 ' rajdhani dilli se sate noida ke sector-44 main guuruuvaar subah privet bas ne auto or ek skool bas main takkar maar di
 The collision was so severe that one of the two women sitting in the auto and the auto driver died on the way to the hospital while the other woman was seriously injured
 vahiin skool bas main savaar aadha darjan bachche bhi ghayal ho gaye
 It is being told that kihadasasubah happened at around eight thirty when Priyagold school bus was carrying children
 jaise hi bas emity ke saamne pahunchi tabhi ek privet bas ek auto se takaraate hue skool bas main ja bhidi
 Pragya and the auto driver, one of the girls sitting in the auto, were killed, while a young woman named Nabita was seriously injured
 sabhighayalon koilaj ke liye noida ke kailash aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 Pragya and Nabita both worked in HCL
 gujarat ke ahmedabad main kankaria adventure park main jhula tuutane kii vajah se bada haadasa ho gaya, jisamen 3 logon kii maut ho gai or 28 log ghayal ho gaye
 This is not the first time in India, while an accident has been witnessed in an amusement park
 isse pehle bhi aise haadase hote rahe hai
 However, the question arises here that if such an incident happens to someone, can a case be filed against Amusement Park and its management? Jitendra Mohan Sharma, Vice President of Supreme Court Bar Association and Advocate Kalika Prasad Kala 'manas' Is that if there is any kind of accident or swing in the amusement park and there is negligence of the amusement park management
 So, a civil case can be done
 aise maamle main amusment park par torts libility (tortious liability) banati he
 In such a case, the court assesses the negligence of the amusement park management and the loss to the victim and then decides the amount of compensation
 edwocket kaala kaa kahana he ki agar haadasa peedit kii galati yaa laaparvaahee se hota he, to amusment park ko jimmedaar nahin thaharaaya ja saktaa he
 This means that if someone jumps from the swing intentionally, the amusement park management is neither negligent nor torts liability in such a case
 lihaaja peedit ko kisi bhi tarah kaa muaavja nahin dilaayaa ja saktaa he
 When will the amusement park management be guilty of negligence? It was asked that how can we know whether the amusement park management is negligent due to an accident? On this, Senior Advocate Jitendra Mohan Sharma and Advocate Kalika Prasad Kala 'manas' of the Supreme Court said that the amusement park management has a legal duty to provide a safe environment to those who come there, take full care of them and take full care
 agar wo aisa nahin karata he, to usko laaparvaahee yani negligence kaa doshi mana jayega
 According to them, the negligence of the amusement park can be detected on these grounds
 
 
 1
 Amusement Park Management has taken all necessary steps to protect the people coming there or not? If the amusement park management does not take all necessary security measures, it can be convicted of negligence
 2
 Whether the amusement park and its machines have been repaired on time? If the amusement park and the machines used there are not repaired in time, the amusement park can be held responsible for negligence
 3
 The amusement park management will have to inform the people coming there about the safety measure
 agar amusment park management aisa nahin karata he or vahaan aane vaale ko kisi bhi tarah kii chot lagati he yaa phir maut hoti he, to uske liye amusment park management ko laaparvaahee kaa jimmedaar tehraaya jayega
 4
 amusment park ke sanchaalan main sabhi niyamon or kanoonon kaa paalan kiya janaa chahie
 If park management violates any kind of rules or laws, then they can be blamed for negligence
 aapaki galati ke liye amusment park nahin hoga jimmedaarsenior edwocket jitendra mohan sharma or edwocket kalika prasad kaala ‘maanas’ kaa kahana he ki agar koi amusment park management ke nirdeshaanusaar suraksha niyamon kaa paalan nahin karata he or isaki vajah se koi haadasa hota he, to uske liye aise haadase kaa shikaar vyakti khud jimmedaar hoga
 Park management cannot be held responsible for the fault of the other
 yah park management ke liye acha bachaav hota he
 In India, Law of Tort Advocate Kalika Prasad says that Law of Tort is a law of much advanced society
 bharat main iskaa bahut kam hi istemaal dekhne ko miltaa he
 However, it is widely used in cases of negociation
 iske alaava supreme court ke senior edwocket jitendra mohan sharma kaa kahana he ki abhi tak bharat main lau of tort utana develop nahin ho paaya he, jitna hona chahie
 However, now it is slowly developing and soon it will be used in India
 amusment park ke khilaaf criminal kesasupreme court ke senior edwocket jitendra mohan sharma kaa kahana he ki agar amusment park laaparvaahee baratata he or apni legal duty ko nahin nibhaataa he or kisi ko koi chot aati he yaa maut ho jaati he, to amusment park management ke khilaaf criminal cese bhi laayaa ja saktaa he
 If someone dies in it, a case can be registered under the Indian Penal Code i
e
 Section 304A of the IPC
 iske tahat 2 saal kii jail or jurmaana kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 Apart from this, a case under Section 336, 337 and 338 of IPC can be registered against Amusement Park Management for negligence
 in dhaaraon main 3 maheene se lekar 2 saal tak kii jail or jurmaane kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan he

 It is smart to sit with books and move around in time for many things
 She always worked a lot and kept remembering her things more than God, remembering all her work
 Beware of remembering the dreamers of finding the lost item in the gimmick of understanding the smell of excessive salt It was painful to take care of her in the left, because the work was never tired and left behind because it could not leave a lot of dust and all the steam left, she could not leave her hot pulses and hot loaves and the way for her even more in a small bed When i slept, i slept so much, when i slept, my last sleep was sooerona, but how relieved was it for me to come at least from China e then been waiting Sathvh the last sleep around?

 ’tharur kii yah tippanee spasht rup se modi dwaara purv main congress par bole gaye hamale ke sandarbh main thi
 In a rally, Modi alleged that he was served chicken biryani during a personal visit of Pakistani Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf in 2013 amid controversy over the beheading of an Indian soldier by the Pakistani army
 pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif sahit dakshes ke shasnadhyakshon ko 26 may ko narendra modi ke shapath grahan samaaroh main shaamil hone ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya he
 Tharoor may have ridiculed Modi through a biryani tweet but publicly acknowledged that he was impressed by the BJP leader's friendly and inclusive statements
 unhone twit kiya, ‘main narendra modi ke maitreepurn or samaveshi bayanon se prabhavit hua hum
 We should make sure that he keeps his words and works for the benefit of all Indians
 ’ yah report likhe jane tak ise 317 baar ritvit kiya gaya or 179 baar ise pasand kiya gaya

 1 percent means only one electric car in a thousand cars
 vaise desh main 2020 tak electric kaaron kii bikri das fisadi se zyada badhane kaa anumaan he
 But currently e-vehicles are very less popular in India
 i-whical industry se jude sosayadi of menuphacturers of electric whical ke aankade bataate hai ki march 2018 main desh kii sadakon par 56 hajaar electric vaahan the jinamein se i-kaaron kii sankhya sirf 1200 thi jabaki baaki 54,800 i-bike thim
 There are two reasons behind these pathetic figures of e-vehicles in India
 pehali ye-ki abhi logon main i-vaahanon ke prati jaagarukta nahin he or duusari vajah he desh main i-vaahanon ke liye jaruri infrastracchar kii kami
 According to the report of the Ministry of Heavy Industry Demand for Heavy Investment, investment of Rs
 14 thousand crores is needed to enhance e-vehicles and charging infrastructure
 Ernst & Young kii electric mobility report ke mutabik har 10 se 12 electric gadiyon par ek charging point hona chahie jabaki desh main is vakt sirf 353 charging stesan hai
 It is evident that there is no environment for e-vehicles in India and to create an environment, apart from subsidies and tax exemptions, the government will also have a challenge to create infrastructure for e-vehicles
 agle teen varshon main bharat kii metro citis main 2700 charging stesan kholane kii yojana he
 Apart from this, there is also a plan to make the quota of forty percent e-cars mandatory in taxi service like Ola and Uber
 sarkaar agar 2030 tak bharat kii sadakon par 40 fisadi i-kaaren chalati hui dekhnaa chaahati he to use agle 12 saalon main is disha main aise or bade or krantikari kadam uthaane honge
 Government's Mega Plan The Government of India has targeted that by 2030, forty percent of the cars and bikes sold in India should be e-vehicles
 centre sarkaar ne bharat main electric vaahanon kii bikri badhaane ke liye agle teen varshon ke liye das hajaar karod rupee ke bajet kaa praavdhaan kiya he
 In this, one thousand crore rupees are to be spent on opening electric vehicles charging stations across the country
 ek anya yojana ke tahat 2022 tak bharat sarkaar electric vaahanon kii kharid par 8,596 karod rupee kii sabsidi bhi degi
 The government plans to start running more than 7000 electric buses on the country's roads by 2022
 iske alaava 2022 tak 35,000 i-car, paanch lakh electric tu-whealer or thri-whilers kii bikri kaa lakshya rakhaa gaya he
 Preparation of companies: The Government of India has shown the will to adopt e-vehicles, but there is not much choice of electric cars in India right now
 maujuuda samay main agar abhi turant koi electric car kharidni ho to ikkaa-dukka vikalp hi hai
 But major car and bike manufacturers in India have started work on launching electric vehicles
 iske tahat maaruti apni pehali electric car 2020 main bharat main launch karegi
 Mahindra and Mahindra has also set a target of making 60 thousand e-cars every year from the year 2020
 hundai motors kii yojana kii yojana isi saal bharat main electronic car launch karne kii he

 Hari Kunzru, one of the four authors who read excerpts from Salman Rushdie's book The Satanic Verses at the Jaipur Sahityotsav, says he wanted to give a speech to a writer who had been silenced by death threats
 
 kunjaru ne samachar patr gargian main likhaa he, "ham jaanate the ki pustak ke ansh kaa paath karnaa uksaava mana jayega, lekin hamane use avaidh nahin mana

 Kunzru said, "the sudden religious outrage over his presence was not spontaneous

 (input from IANS) anna hajaare ne aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar lokapal vidheyak ke mudde par saamaajik kaaryakartaaon ko dhokhaa de rahi he or kaha ki vah bhrashtachar ke khilaaf yoga guru ramdev ke anshan andolan main shaamil honge
 Gandhian Hazare said that the government lacked the willpower to overthrow corruption
 unhone kaha ki main baba ramdev ke andolan main paanch june ko shariq huunga
 The fight is against corruption
 sarkaar ne hamen dhokhaa dene kii koshish kii he
 The government assured us that it would consider our demands
 hajaare ne kaha ki vah aage ke kaarykram ko lekar yoga guru se charchaa karenge
 Hazare said that the government has cheated social workers on the issue of Lokpal Bill and people have felt the betrayal of the government
 unhone kaha ki main baba ramdev kaa samarthan karuunga taaki sarkaar vah na kar sake jo usne tab kiya jab ham lard rahe the
 We will fight together against corruption
 aage se ham bhrashtachar ko ukhaad phenkane ke mudde par maukhik aashwaasano se santusht nahin honge
 Hazare also mentioned that the yoga guru has a reputation in the public and people gather to listen to him wherever he goes
 buudhvaar ko baba ramdev ke saath hui vitt mantri pranav mukherjee, kapil sibbal, pawan kumaar bansal or subodh kaant sahay kii baatcheet ke ek din baad hajaare kii yah tippanee ai he
 The four ministers tried to convince Baba Ramdev not to go on hunger strike on the issue of corruption, but the yoga guru said that he would start his agitation from June 4
 sarkaar chaahati he ki phir se us tarah kii sthiti paidaa na ho jo april main lokapal vidheyak ke mudde par anna hajaare ke andolan se paidaa hui thi
 The government's assurance at that time does not seem to produce any immediate result
 baba ramdev videshon main jamaa kaale dhan ko waapas laane ke mudde par aashwaasano kii bajaay karrwai kii baat par ad gaye hai
 Hazare also made it clear that every officer should come under the purview of Lokpal Bill
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar tabhi harakat main ai he jab ramdev ne yah spasht kar diya he ki vah chaar june se apana andolan shuru karenge
 Hazare said that since so many days we have been making demands (immediate implementation of Lokpal Bill), why the government did not listen to us
 ab sarkaar sirf is vajah se daud rahi he ki anshan par baithne kaa samay aa gaya he
 He said 'baba Ramdev has been raising demands for bringing back black money for a long time
 sarkaar ne is mudde par kuch karne kii kyon nahin sochi
 People now want to know what the government's intentions are
 ’ gandhivadi kaaryakarta ne kaha ki bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai tab tak jari rahegi jab tak ki unki maangen puri nahin ho jaatin
 Hazare said, "we no longer want hollow assurances or verbal promises
" ham bhrashtachar ke khilaaf karrwai chaahate hai or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf deshbhar main tab tak ladaai jari rahegi jab tak ki hamen vah nahin mil jaataa jo ham chaahate hai

 Campaigning has started for the Lok Sabha elections
 aise samay main congress ke diggaj netaa or purv kendriya mantri jitin prasad naaraaz chal rahe hai
 It is believed that Jitin Prasad may leave the Congress and join the BJP
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki prasad dhaurhara seat se bijepi ke ummidavaar ho sakate hai
 However, the top leadership of the Congress is busy persuading him
 congress party ne jitin prasad ko upi kii dhaurhara loksabhaa seat se ummidavaar banaaya he
 However, later the Congress leadership told him to contest from Lucknow seat
 isi baat ko lekar jitin prasad naaraaz maane ja rahe hai
 However, there was no concrete reply from Jitin Prasad on the issue
 unhone kaha ki aap ye sawaal kis saboot ke aadhaar par puch rahe hai
 Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah also taunted that if every media channel is questioning, then why are Jitin Prasad giving such bold answers
 Why can’t@jitinprasadajust give a categorical denial? It’s hardly a hypothetical question when every news channel is carrying reports

 The BJP has once again announced the name of Rajnath Singh from Lucknow seat
 bijepi ne bareli, shahjahanpur or lakhimpur siton par ummidavaaron ke naam kii ghoshnaa kii, lekin dhaurhara se pratyaashee ke naam kaa elaan nahin kiya he
 In such a situation, political speculations are being made that BJP has not fielded its candidate on Dhaurahara seat due to Jitin Prasad
 aise main bijepi jitin prasad kaa daaman tham sakate hai or party unhen ummidavaar bana sakati he
 Before the municipal elections of UP, Jitin Prasad's brother Jayesh Prasad and his wife Neelima Prasad left the Congress and joined the BJP
 nilimaa prasad shahjahanpur nagar palika adhyaksh pad par bijepi ummidavaar ke taur par chunaav ladi thi or jeetne main safal rahi thi
 Let me tell you that the Dharaura seat first came into existence in 2009 and Jitin Prasad won this seat from the Congress ticket
 lekin saal 2014 main bijepi ke rekha verma se haar gaye the
 Jitin Prasad is the son of senior Congress leader Jitendra Prasad

 nidhi agarwal jald hi tiger shroff kii saath unki nai film 'munna maaikel' main najar aane vaali hai
 Nidhi may become a superstar after this film, but at the moment, she is having two to four problems with common working girls in Mumbai
 darasal nidhi ko haal hi main mumbai kii ek sosayadi se apana flats khaali karnaa padaa he kyonki vah 'single' hai
 According to media reports, Nidhi, a resident of Bengaluru, lives with a college friend in a society in Bandra area in Mumbai
 aise main achaanak ghar se beghar hone ke baad ab wo mumbai main apana ghar talash rahi hai
 The comments nidhi main ne is vishay main mid-de se baat karte hue kaha, 'main lagbhag 6 maheenon se apni dost ke saath rah rahi thi
 Now i am looking for a new home which is very difficult to find in Mumbai
 ' nidhi ne is baatcheet ke dauraan kaha, ' kyonki main single hum or ek actress hum, isliye mujhe ghar dene se manaa kar diya jaataa he
 This is the biggest difficulty for me so far
 ' Though Nidhi did not give any information about her housing society, she said that society members often refuse to give flats to new actors as they are always skeptical of their earnings
 bataa den ki isse pehle nidhi agarwal apni film 'munna maaikel' ke liye bhi 'no dating' cloj par sin kar chuki hai
 Actually according to this clause, Nidhi cannot date anyone during this film
 nidhi ne is par kaha tha ki unhen isse zyada problem isliye nahin hui kyonki vah samajhati hai ki aisa produsar kaam main unki 100 percent dedication chaahate hai isliye kiya
 Nidhi says that i think that such a clause has been kept because two-star dating is often the easiest way for the publicity of a film but it shifts the focus away from the film
 main chaar ghante bhi apana phone dur rakh kar apni film par dhyaan de sakati hum
 In this film, Tiger Shroff will be seen as a passionate street dancer and he is shown to be a strong fan of Michael Jackson
 film ko diarector shabbir khan diarect kar rahe hai

 isse pehle vah 'heropanti' or 'baagi' main saath kaam kar chuke hai
 Talking to mid-day about this in Nidhi, she said, 'I was living with my friend for almost 6 months
 ab main ek nayaa ghar dhund rahi hum jo mumbai main dhundhna bahut mushkil he
 'nidhi said during this conversation,' Because i am single and an actress, i am denied home
 yah abhi tak kii mere liye sabase badi mushkil he
 ' haalanki nidhi ne apni houseing sosayadi ke bare main koi bhi jaankaree nahin di, par unhone kaha ki sosyati mambers aksar nae actors ko flats dene main anakani karte hai kyonki unhen unki kamai par hameshaa andeh rahata he
 Let me tell you that before this Nidhi Aggarwal has also signed for her film 'munna Michael' on 'no Dating' Clause
 darasal is cloj ke mutabik nidhi is film ke dauraan kisi ko date nahin kar sakati
 Nidhi had said on this that she did not get more problems than this because she understands that the producers wanted 100 percent dedication in the work
 nidhi kahati hai ki mujhe lagata he ki aisa cloj isliye rakhaa gaya he ki aksar do-stars kii dating film kii publicity ke liye sabase aasaan tarika hota he lekin yah film se focus dur kar detaa he
 i can concentrate on my film by keeping my phone away for four hours
 is film main tiger shroff ek joshilay street dancer kii bhoomika main najar aaenge or unhen maaikel jackson kaa jabardast fain dikhaaya gaya he
 The film is being directed by director Shabbir Khan

 unhone kaha, ‘ek atirikt gendbaaj shaayad aapako un maichon ko khatm karne main madad kar saktaa he jinhone aap pehle khatm nahin kar paae
 It is not a matter of scoring more runs but of taking 20 wickets

 He said that he will be one of the youngest teams of India to come here
 agar aap is team kii ausat umr dekho to yah 25-26 saal hogi
 This was not the case with teams coming here in the last 15 years
 yah kaaphi yuva team bhi he
 Sri Lanka's team is also young but you can make up for it in the domestic situation
 yah yuva banaam yuva hoga or saath hi behad romaanchak bhi
 In the case of the best five batsmen Rohit Sharma and Cheteshwar Pujara, Shastri said that Rohit is a contender for a place in the playing XI
 rohit sharma ke bare main unhone kaha, ‘vah stareey khilaadi he
 It is just a matter of spending time at the crease and getting started and then we know what he can do
 yah uske liye sahi sthaan hoga kyonki uske paas palatwaar karne kii kshamta he
 In the context of Pujara, Shastri said, "if Pujara remains among the best five batsmen in the team, then he will play if he does not
" mujhe yakeen he ki vah vaapasi karegaa visheshkar tab jab ham sirf chaar gendbaajon ke saath khelenge
 'saha will be under pressure
 The strategy of landing with five bowlers will put additional responsibility on the lower order and all eyes will be on Wriddhiman Saha who is coming at number six
 bengal kaa yah wicketiper apni sarvshereshth farm main nahin he or yah siries se pehle team ke liye chintaa kii baat ho sakati he
 He said, "saha is a very good player and he may get out soon but he has the ability to score runs

 Input: language gujarat ke ahmedabad se ek ajibo-garib maamla saamne aayaa he, yahaan civil aspataal main maansik rup se biimaar ek vyakti kaa oparation kar uske pet se kareeb chaar kilo kii chijen nikaali gai hai, aashcharya kii baat yah he ki inamen kul 452 metal shaamil hai
 The condition of the person is said to be stable after the operation
 ahmedabad ke civil aspataal main 28 saal ke vyakti ko pet main dard kii shikaayat ke baad maansik taur par bimaaron ke liye bane aspataal main bhartee kiya
 Doctors were shocked after the X-ray, the X-ray showed many metal things in the person's body, after which his operation was done
 What was revealed after the operation of four and a half hours by the team of four doctors was amazing
 vyakti pet se nat bolt, nail kattar, sefti pin, paise ke sikke jaisi 452 metal kii chijen nikaali gayi
 These include a total of 452 metals
 Actually, doctors said that the patient had been eating similar things for the last 7 -8 months due to being mentally ill
 unhone bataaya ki marij ko schizophrenia naam kii beemaari he jisamen wo kisi ke dwaara bataane par aisi hi chijen khaataa hafilhal marij kii haalat sthir he abhi wo doctor kii nigaraanee main rakhaa gaya he
 Doctors said that gradually his condition will improve

 rahul gandhi loksabhaa chunaav main haar ke baad pehali baar aaj amethi ja rahe hai
 During his visit, he will meet party workers and know their condition
 sambhawatah chunaav nateezon kii bhi samiksha karenge
 But apart from this, it is being told that Rahul Gandhi will keep his visit away from the media, which means that he wants to keep this trip away from the eyes of the camera
 asal main, rahul gandhi kii is yatra kaa sandesh yah he ki bhale hi vah amethi se chunaav haar gaye hai, lekin unka athmiya rishta amethi se bana hua he
 This is his karmabhoomi, which he has inherited, and would like to retain it
 amethi aisi sansadeey seat rahi he jiskaa congress or khaskar gandhi parivaar se gaharaa rishta rahaa he
 Amethi seat came into existence in 1967 and during that time Vidyadhar Vajpayee of Congress reached Parliament in the Lok Sabha elections
 is seat kaa sansadeey itihaas bataata he ki ab tak yahaan se zyaadaatar samay congress jitati rahi he
 Very few occasions came when the Congress lost its seat
 apatkaal ke baad 1977 main janata party ke ravindra pratap singh is seat se jeet the jabaki 1980 main jab dobaaraa chunaav hue to sanjay gandhi jeet hasil karne main kaamyaab rahe the
 In 1998, this seat again went to BJP and Sanjay Singh won the election
 is tarah ikkaa-dukka maukon ko chhod diya jaae to is seat par amuman congress or gandhi parivaar kaa hi kabja rahaa he
 Sanjay Gandhi, again after Rajiv Gandhi, Satish Sharma of Congress twice won from this seat
 1999 main hue chunaav main sonia gandhi maidan main utrin or sansad pahunchin
 After this, Rahul Gandhi continued to reach Parliament from Amethi since 2004
 lekin is baar phir congress chook gai or 1998 ke baad amethi seat bijepi ke khate main chali gai or smriti irani jeet hasil karne main kaamyaab raheen
 However, Rahul Gandhi wants to convey this message from his journey that his relationship will be with Nata Amethi
 na congress party or na hi rahul gandhi amethi ko kabhi chhodana nahin chahenge
 Amethi Lok Sabha constituency has been the stronghold of Congress and the defeat from here is a big setback not only for Rahul Gandhi but for the entire party
 ise rahul gandhi se behatar koun samaj saktaa he? The pair of Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi, popularly known as 'indian Express', entered the final of the Australian Open Tennis tournament keeping the winning momentum in the semi-finals of the men's doubles

 It is noteworthy that Paes and Bhupathi decided to pair up just before the Australian Open after playing separately for nine years

 Dragon is searching for a new hideout in the neighborhood of India
 ab nepal par he china kii chalbaaj najar
 Attempting to siege India by making inroads into neighboring countries around India is an old strategy of China and the new target of this strategy is becoming Nepal
 sadiyon se bharat kaa dost rahaa nepal ab china ke paale main sarakta dikhaai de rahaa he
 China is steadily increasing its penetration in Nepal
 wo nepal ke bheetar nae thikaane banane main juta he
 China is going to start work on three very important projects simultaneously in Nepal
 dryport banane kii he china kii yojanachin kii yojana nepal ke tathopani main ek dryport banane kii he
 a transport cargo is a center of operation that is directly connected to a seaport by rail or road
 bharat kii madad se nepal ke birganj main pehle hi aisa ek dryport kaam kar rahaa he
 Now China is also going to build a similar transport in Nepal
 china kii yojana nepal ke pokhara main ek international airport banane kii bhi he
 Apart from this, China also wants to create a special economic zone in Pachkhal, Nepal
 china nepal se lagi apni seemaa par shandaar sadakon kaa jaal pehle hi bicha chukaa he or ab uski yojana kanghai-tibet railway ko aage badhaakar nepal ke border tak laane kii he
 The interference of China cannot be ignored
 It is obvious that China is continuously increasing its interference within Nepal
 nepal ke bheetar china kii badhati dakhal ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa
 To say that all these projects are related to development, but it cannot be denied that after the completion of such projects, China's influence over Nepal will increase considerably and it can prove to be harmful for India
 bahut mumkin he ki nepal ke upar china kii meharbaani kii badi vajah bharat ke is padosi desh se bharat ke prabhaav ko khatm karnaa hi ho
 Obviously, it is time for India's strategists to be attentive and to understand the importance of Nepal's growing proximity with China in due course of time
 cricket world cap ke itihaas main is baar kuch nayaa hone ja rahaa he
 This time it is certain that a team that will reach the final of the World Cup never reached the final before
 newjiland or south africa ke bich world cap kaa pehla semifinal mangalvaar ko oakland main khelaa jayega
 Although New Zealand has played the World Cup semi-finals the most 7 times, this is the fourth semi-final for South Africa
 lekin is artical ke lekhak ko lagata he ki tamaam aankadon or myth ko jhuthalaate hue is baar south africa ke final main pahunchane ke zyada asaar hai
 The upper hand of the guest hovered above the host
 
 New Zealand have won all their matches in the 2015 World Cup so far
 vahiin south africa ko apane 7 main se 5 maichon main jeet or 2 muqablon main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 The figures are certainly visible in favor of hosts New Zealand but South Africa is a strong contender for the World Cup this time
 aaie khilaadi-dar-khilaadi donon tiimon ko taulate hai
 AB de Villiers vs Brendon mccullum: It is not only a match of two identical teams but also a match of two identical batsmen and captain
 abi divilliars or brendan makkulam donon hi is samay behtareen form main hai
 Both are equally dangerous
 lekin divilliars kaa form makkulam ke upar baari pad saktaa he
 De Villiers has scored 417 runs in 7 matches so far, while mccullum's bat has risen to 269 runs playing as many matches
 haalanki strike rate ke maamle main makkulam jarur aage hai
 Actually mccullum is like a gamble, so it is very difficult to stop him
 lekin concystancy ke maamle main divilliars makkulam se behatar najar aae hai
 De Villiers is also considered a good strategist as a captain and his team balance is also slightly better than New Zealand
 del sten vs trent bolt:newjiland agar maujuuda world cap main is mukaam par he to isamen sabase bada yogadan unke gendbaajon kaa he
 In the first semi-final on Tuesday, the Kiwi team will once again depend heavily on Trent Boult
 bolt is samay world cap main sabase zyada (19) wicket lene vaale gendbaaj hai
 Bolt has impressed everyone a lot, but he will have a real test in front of the batting batting of South Africa
 vahiin south africa ke paas anbhavi del sten hai
 Big player of a big match
 beshak is world cap main sten kaa pradarshan ummiido ke mutabik na ho lekin yah gendbaaj kabhi bhi form main vaapasi karke vipakshi batting ko tahas-nahas kar saktaa he
 Morne Morkel and Kyle Abbott of South Africa are in excellent form at the moment
 vahiin newjiland ke tim soudi westeindies ke khilaaf jis tarah se pite hai unka hausala thodaa gira hua he
 Adam Milan's injury also weakened the bowling of the hosts
 hashim amala vs martin guptil:martin guptil kaa form newjiland ke liye sone par suhaaga he
 Guptill has scored 498 runs in 7 matches so far
 semifinal main is ballebaaj kaa pradarshan kiviyon ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn rahegaa
 On the other hand, Hashim Amla is such a batsman who has the ability to stand anchor against any bowling
 aamala ne is world cap main 323 ran banaae hai
 If Kiwis are to reach the final, then Amla will have to settle early and Guptill will have to play big innings once again
 miller, dumini, duplysis vs williamsan, tailor, anderson:donon tiimon ke middle order kii baat karen to south africa kii team behatar najar aati he
 The bat of David Miller and Faf Duplessis is in color, while Duminy has always been considered a thinking cricketer
 riley ruso or quinton di cock bhi south africa ballebaaji ko chaar chand laga sakate hai
 While the middle order of the Kiwis is comparatively slightly weaker
 ken williamsan ne kuch muqablon main ran jarur banaae hai lekin pradarshan main ekarupata nahin rahi he
 Ross Taylor is seen battling for form
 kori anderson aakraamak jarur hai lekin concystancy kii kami saaf dikhi he
 Grant Elliott and Luc Ronki have not received much batting, and have proved to be failures when found
 aise main madhyakram south africa kaa majboot he
 Daniel Vettori vs Imran Tahir: Daniel Vettori's performance has been very commendable even on the small New Zealand grounds
 apane anubhav kaa phayda uthaate hue vittori ne 7 maichon main 15 wicket liye hai
 In such a situation, the batsmen of South Africa will have to play this bowler a bit
 vahiin south africa leg spinner imran taahir bhi gajab ke form main hai or unhone bhi itane hi match khelkar 15 wicket chatkaaye hai
 But New Zealand's spin department is slightly better based on experience
 oakland kaa maidan chota jarur he lekin spinner bhi ballebaajon ke liye acchhee-khaasi chunauti pesh kar sakate hai

 purv general vikram singh ne kaha ki yah pehali baar hua he ki political intent clear hua he
 And under that action has been taken
 iske liye ham hameshaa taiyaar rahete hai
 Ahead of the second Test against New Zealand in Kolkata starting on Friday, Indian captain Virat Kohli has said that he might consider using the Umpire Decision Review System or Decision Review System (DRS) in the future
 kohli kaha ki hamane iske bare main charchaa kii he or bhavishya main diares ke istemaal karne ke bare main jarur sochaa ja saktaa he
 We have been opposing this system, as there are many apprehensions about ball tracking and Hawk Eye
 is vishay par or charchaa kii jarurat he
 Kohli's statement differs from the opinion of former Test captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and the board, who outright rejected the use of DRS
 board ke maujuuda adhyaksh anuraag thakur bhi ab tak diares takanic 'phulpruf' nahin hone kii vajah se use apnaane ke haq main nahin dikhe hai
 Kohli said that we cannot condemn the umpire's wrong decision too much, because we have decided not to use DRS ourselves
 hamaare liye ye kahana uchit nahin hoga
 Once you start using DRS, then its shortcomings can be thought of
 iske bare main pehle bhi kaaphi kaha ja chukaa he, lekin ham is par jarur or vichaar karnaa chaahate hai
 Team India will reach the top! When the Indian team takes on New Zealand in the second match, they will have to win the series and win the series as well as regain the top position in the Test rankings

 On this occasion, Rajnath Singh launched the Mainstream Civil Defense in Disaster Risk Reduction Scheme and it will be implemented in 32 states and union territories during the 12th Five Year Plan
 unhone civil dephence or home guard karmiyon ko nagarikon main vishwaas paidaa karne vaala bataaya or kaha ki is vibhaag ko prabhavi or majboot bananaa jaruri he
 He said that these are important departments which are not getting their rightful place and need to be respected among the public

 In this football season, most Indians regret that 1

 It is not the only ground in which India is backward in the world
 vishvavidhyalay main shiksha kii haalat aisa hi ek or kshetra he
 In ancient times, universities like Nalanda and Taxila made India a center of higher education
 vah aitihaasik viraasat kai vajahon se taar-taar ho gai
 Today's bitter truth is: out of 850 Indian universities, not a single university is in the top 20 in any global ranking
 tasalli kii akeli baat yah he ki cues or times hair ajukeshan ranking main vishwa ke sheersh 1,000 vishvavidhyalayon main bharat ke kramshah 24 or 42 vishvavidhyalayon ne apana mukaam banaaya he
 In the recently released QS Rankings 2019, our three higher education institutions have been ranked among the top 200 universities in the world
 magar maayoos hone kii bajaae isse jude jimmedaar logon ko ek aisa pratispardhi maahaul banane ke samuhik lakshya ke liye kadi mehnat kerani chahie jo hindustani vishvavidhyalayon ko sheersh 100 main daakhil hone or aakhirkaar sheersh 20 main apana mukaam banane ke liye prerit kar sake
 The India Today group-mdra survey of the best universities in the country is a step in this direction
 apane paanchaven saal main is survey ne na keval apane falak kaa vistaar kiya he, balki chaanbin kii zyada majboot prakriya bhi apanaai he (dekhen survey kaa tarika)
 Universities were divided into four categories — general, technical, medical, and law — to create a level playing field
 bahut-se vishyon main paathyakramon kii peshkash karne vaale vishvavidhyalayon par saamaanya shrenee ke tahat vichaar kiya gaya
 Universities offering only post-graduate courses were evaluated for ranking
 vishvavidhyalayon ke pradarshan kii jaanch-padtaal main jo kadai barti gai, usne vishvavidhyalayon kii india today ranking ko desh kaa sabase bharosemand tathaa sabase vyapak or sampurna survey bana diya he
 Says Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar, "the India Today Survey has earned the name because it is done with reliability, transparency and certain criteria
" ''is saal hamane sheersh vishvavidhyalayon ke kuch yashasvi purv chaatro ko bhi aamantrit kiya ki ve apni matra sanstha or in varshon main usamen aae badlaavon ke bare main likhen
 He expressed concern that the quality of teachers in universities is declining and the main reason for this is due to political appointments in universities and caste and region based selection processes
 nateeja yah he ki vishvavidhyalay padhai-likhaai main utkrushtataa ke boote nahin balki galat vajahon se surkhiyon main aate hai
 But more worrying than poor appointments is the lack of teachers
 is saal janvari main desh ke behtareen vishvavidhyalayon main se ek dilli vishvavidhyalay ne shikshakon kii 48 fisadi kami hone kii ittila di—1,706 sweekrut padon main se 805 khaali pade the
 After that the university has appointed around 150 teachers
 dilli vishvavidhyalay koi alag-thalag misaal nahin he
 33% of the posts of teachers in central universities have not been filled
 2009 ke baad sthapit kendriya vishvavidhyalayon main shikshakon ke 49 fisadi pad khaali pade hai
 The condition is similar in state and private universities
 is kami se ubarne ke liye vishvavidhyalayon ne tadarth yaa asthaayee shikshakon kii sevaayen lene kaa rasta akhriyaar kiya he
 Government universities do this because state governments repeatedly ignore requests to approve appointments, while private universities have adopted this as a cost-saving strategy, with ad hoc teachers paying less
 isane shiksha kii gunvattta ko buree tarah prabhavit kiya he
 Furkan Qamar, Secretary General of the Association of Indian Universities, in a recent article, made an interesting analysis of the teacher-student ratio in Indian and international universities
 vaishvik rankings main sheersh sthaan paane waalon main prayek vishvavidhyalay ausatan 18,000 chaatro ko daakhila dete hai
 In comparison, India's top universities enroll an average of 11,000 students
 vaishvik str par sheersh vishvavidhyalay 1,800 yogya shikshakon kii ausat taadaad hone kaa daawa karte hai, jabaki bharat ke sheersh vishvavidhyalayon main yah aankada 600 se bhi kam he
 The poor performance in research and innovation is also a major reason for India's universities not being among the best universities in the world
 aarthik survey 2018 bataata he ki kis tarah shodh or vikaas main bharat kaa kharch beete do dashakon se jidipi ke 0
 6-0
 7 fisadi par tehra hua he
 In view of this, the Central Government has introduced several schemes and financial assistance to promote basic research in higher education institutions (read: Prakash Javadekar interview)
 jane-maane arthshaastri kowshik basu ne haal hi main kaha ki sabhi vishvavidhyalayon ko ek hi chashme se dekhnaa munasib nahin he or sarkaar ko unamem se kuch ko chunakar vaishvik pratishtha kii shodh sansthaaon ke rup main viksit karnaa chahie
 He said, "you cannot run the country with 700 top level universities
 aapako taiyaar hona hoga ki unamem se 680 vishvavidhyalay padhai kii acchhee or thos shiksha dene vaali dukaane hongi
 The remaining 20 will be research universities
 log vahaan atyaadhunik anusandhan karenge, aap unhen jagah, shodh ke liye rakam or sahaara denge
 i understand that only India will rise
 ''centre jaldi hi un 20 utkrisht sansthaaon kii suchi kaa elaan karegaa jinhen is makasad se chunaa gaya he
 With this, one part of Basu's suggestion will be implemented
 aglaa kadam yah hoga ki baaki vishvavidhyalayonko kam se kam vishwastareey 'shiksha kii dukaane' to banaaen
 The ranking of such universities was done by New Delhi-based research agency Marketing and Development Research Associates (MDRA), India Today Group's Best University Survey 2018 between November 2017 and May 2018
 survey main chaar stream—saamaanya, technical, medical or lau—ke 100 se zyada vishvavidhyalayon ko shaamil kiya gaya
 Only those universities where fulltime classroom courses are available and at least three batches have passed by the academic year 2017-18
 unhen unke post-graduate paathyakramon ke aadhaar par rank di gai
 For the objective rankings, MDRA carefully selected over 120 features for the most comprehensive and balanced comparison of universities
 kaamkaaj ke in sanketakon ko milakar paanch vyapak maandand banaae gaye—pratishtha or gavarnence, academik or shodh utkrushtataa, infrastracchar or maahaul, vyaktitv or netritv kaa vikaas or kariyar kii tarakkee or placement

 Significantly, this is not the first time that the Shiv Sena chief has attacked the Modi government

 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, while challenging the BJP to call the construction of Ram temple a 'jumla', said that on saying this, he (BJP) would come from 280 seats in Lok Sabha to two seats
 BJP par nishaanaa sadhate hue unhone kaha ki ram mandir nirmaan ke liye ayodhya main jo inte ikatthi kii gayi thi, vah hakeekat main ram mandir ke liye nahin balki satta hasil karne kii banaai gai seedhi ke liye thim
 a case of rape with a private airlines trainee air hostess in Amar Colony area of delhi has come to light
 peedit ladki ne usee airlines main kaam karne vaale muvin ahamed parrepakarne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 It is being told that Muveen and the victim girl were good friends
 ladki ne aarope lagaaya he ki kaam ke dauraan ek din uski mulaakaat muvin ahamed naam ke shaks se hui
 Muvin also worked in the same airline
 dhire dhire donon kii dosti gahari hoti chali gai
 Muveen took advantage of this and took him to a friend's party one day, where he was raped after feeding him a drug
 peedit kii maane to ghatana ke baad muvin ne peedit ladki ko shaadi kii baat kahkar bharose main liya or lagaataar uskaa shaareerik shoshan karata rahaa
 Meanwhile, the victim girl was pregnant three times, but on three occasions Muvin got her abortion done
 duusare dharm main shaadi karne kii ichha kii vajah se peedit ke ghar vaale bhi uskaa saath dene ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Therefore, a case has been registered at Amar Colony police station in Delhi on the basis of the complaint of the victim after he overturned the promise of marriage
 lekin police ab tak aaropee ko giraftaar nahin kar pai he
 The victim girl has also alleged that Muveen has played with many girls in the past, but many girls did not come forward due to fear of society
 ab peedit ladki ne is maamle main insaaf kii guhaar lagaai he taaki aaropee ko uske kiye kii sajaa dilaai ja sake

 China has been continuously expanding rail networks in Tibet, bridging the gap between hard mountains and deep rivers
 usne pehle beijing or lhasa ke durgam ilaake ko rail link se joda or ab wo lhasa se qareeb 250 kilometre aage shigaaze tak rail line bicha chukaa he
 Shigaze is a prefecture in the south of Tibet, bordering Nepal and Bhutan
 hamane lhasa-shigaaze rail link ke bich main padane vaale ek stesan chushve ko dekha
 The railway station is built like an airport
 yahaan, suraksha sambandhi tamaam aise upkaran lagaae gaye hai, jise amuman ham airport par hi dekhte he
 Despite being an Asian country, China has attained that height on the scale of development, which we used to see only in western countries earlier
 lhasa shigaaze ke bich abhi ek hi train chalati he jo lhasa se subah nikalati he or shigaaze se dopaher nikal shaam ko waapas lhasa pahunch jaati he
 Chuashwe railway station official Zao Sinchun told us that more trains can be run on this railway line as the number of passengers increases
 railway stesan ko is tarah se banaaya gaya he ki wo 50 saal baad kii zaruuraton par bhi khara utre
 Because of the difficult mountainous terrain in Tibet, the task of laying the railway line is not easy, but digging the tunnel is as easy for China as digging a small bill
 haalanki tibet autonamas rizan kaa daawa he ki is tarah ke vikaas kaamon ko karne ke pehle paryaavaran se jude har maanak kaa khyaal rakhaa jaataa he

 It plans to connect every village in Tibet with a highway so that any village can have direct access to Beijing
 iske alaava wo puure tibet main ek darjan se zyaada airport banane kii yojana par bhi kaam kar rahaa he
 For this kind of development work, he has spent US $ 13 billion in the last 20 years and intends to spend any amount further
 china kii yojana is rail line ko nepal tak le jane kii he
 It is being requested repeatedly from Nepal
 donon deshon ke bich ise lekar pratinidhiyon kaa daura bhi ho chukaa he
 First the plan is to take the rail to the border city of Nepal and then connect the capital of Nepal to Kathmandu
 china kii yojana to bharat se lagane vaali seemaa tak rail line bichaane kii he jise lekar bharat main samrik chintaa bhi jataai jaati he
 However, dismissing any such concern, the People's Government of Tibet Autonomous Region states that the expansion of railways is an internal matter of a country and China's central government sees it as structural development and commercial expansion
 bharat ko bhi iske faayde ko samajhnaa chahie
 TAR also indicates that India should also think to connect directly with China by rail link
 haalanki is tarah koi aupchaarik prastaav abhi nahin he
 This visit to Tibet shows that China has absorbed Tibet in the way of development in such a way that any dissatisfaction cannot be expressed here

 South Africa needed 13 runs in the last over and their tail batsman Robin Peterson gave his team the victory by hitting 16 runs off the first four balls
 dhoni se jab poocha gaya ki kya nehra ko antim over saunpna sahi faisla tha jabaki aaf spinner harbhajan singh ke bhi over bache hue the, unhone kaha, ‘mere paas harbhajan hi keval vikalp bachaa tha lekin meraa maananaa he ki aisi paristhitiyon main tej gendbaaj adhik upyogi hote hai
 i may be wrong, but i think that was the better option
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘pichley kuch maheenon tak vah hamaara mukhya gendbaaj rahaa he
 He always bowled well in powerplays and slag overs and so i feel nothing wrong in believing him
 ’bhartiya captain ne kaha, ‘hamaare gendbaajon ko sahi sthaan par gend karne kii jarurat thi lekin ve bahut adhik dabaav main the tathaa yadi aap niyamit taur par sahi sthaan par gend nahin karte ho to aap par shaat lag saktaa he
 Apart from this, the South African batsmen also batted well
 ’bhartiya team ballebaaji powerple main aaj acha pradarshan nahin kar paayi lekin dhoni ne kaha ki team desh ke liye khelti he darshakon ke liye nahin
 He said, 'the team plays not for the spectators but for the country
 ballebaaj keval darshakon ke liye chauke chakke nahin maar saktaa he
 We needed to bat the entire 50 overs
 ’ dhoni ne kaha ki 296 ran kaa score bura nahin tha lekin unke kshetrarakshan main ab bhi halkaa sudhaar hi dekhne ko mila he
 He said, 'it is okay that we fell a few runs but the score of 296 runs was not bad
 yadi ham behatar kshetrarakshan karne main safal rahete the to yahi score bada ban jaataa lekin hamaari team achche kshetrarakshan ke liye nahin jaani jaati he
 South African captain Graeme Smith attributed the victory to the bowlers and tail batsmen
 dakshin africa ne bharat ke antim nau wicket 29 ran ke andar ukhaade the
 Smith said, "our bowlers in the first 25 overs looted a lot of runs but later we came back alive with a really tough challenge
 yahaan kaaphi shor ho rahaa tha lekin hamaare khilaadiyon ne vastav main behtareen khel kaa pradarshan kiya
 Regarding Peterson who scored the winning run, Smith said, "I have been watching for a long time that Robbie hits the ball well
" hamane is vishwa cap main uskaa samarthan kiya or usne shandaar pradarshan kiya he
 Dale Steyn was adjudged Man of the Match for taking five wickets in the match
 unhone kaha ki puri team ke prayaas se hi yah jeet mil paayi

 When Narendra Modi's NDA government is completing one year, it is pertinent to ask if the expectations of May 2014 are going to be fulfilled
 lekin iskaa jawaab dene se pehle yah jayja lenaa behatar hoga ki pichley isi samay ham kahaan the
 Thirty years ago, we were promised that poverty would be eradicated, but a year ago, one-third of the population was living in abject poverty, while the other one-third of the population was also very poor and their daily income was very much below the minimum international standards
 Was below
 rosemara ke len-dein main bhrashtachar lut-khasot ke str par pahunch gaya tha; nitigat bhrashtachar ko lalit kala main badalakar acolpaneey oonchai par pahunchaa diya gaya tha
 The purpose and honesty of every national institution was indeed under suspicion
 dhankuberon or arbapatiyon kii vikaas dar duniya bhar main sabase oonchi thi, vahiin kisaanon kii khudakushi kii dar usase bhi oonchi thi
 In such a situation, it would be like asking for a quick turnaround within a year, to be expected to run in a marathon only after one day of avoiding catering to a very fat middle-aged man who lives a very high life
 phir bhi yah to daawey ke saath kaha ja saktaa he ki centre sarkaar ke kaamkaaj kii haalat main ascharyajanak dhang se sudhaar aayaa he (yahi baat rajyon ke prashasan ke bare main nahin kahi ja sakati)
 Of course, things have not deteriorated — though the reforms taken are questionable as to whether they are substantial and effective in terms of quality — and the trend still remains 'cautiously optimistic'
 sarkaar ke agenda ke do bade sudhaaron ko lijie—bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon kii samiksha or vastu tathaa seva kar (jiesti) vidheyak
 These two are needed to get started: if the development projects are to be taken up, especially to help the rural sector, then the Land Acquisition Act needs to be changed immediately
 ahm mudda yah he ki kisaan santusht hona chahie or iske liye makul halaat paidaa kiye jane chahie
 When GST is passed, it will be beneficial for all Indians
 apni taraf se puraa jor lagane ke liye sarkaar ko puure number die jane chahie, bhale hi aditol vipaksh se nipatane kii uski ranneeti behtareen na ho
 Now is the time, leave no stone unturned to cross both these laws in a just manner under the Constitution
 nai sarkaar kaa ek dhwajvahak kaarykram jan dhan yojana he
 Taking advantage of the recent major technological advancements, the Digital India program is striving to bring e-connectivity across all the blocks by 2015 and expand 2G / 3G connectivity to 3,50,000 panchayats
 is tarah sarkaar shaharon or gaanvon ke bich kii khai ko bharne or desh ke sabase doordaraj ke ilaakon ko najadik laane ke makasad se kaam kar rahi he
 It has tremendous potential to completely change the situation
 isse sarkari yojanaon kaa paisa bich main hadap lene main baari kami aegi, iske alaava nai i-pipelinon ke jariye un sevaaon kaa vistaar bharat ke harek ilaake main kiya ja sakegaa, jo abhi tak pehle darje se chathe darje tak ke shaharon main hi uplabdh thim
 However it would be naive to think that only technology can make things accessible to remote areas; In order to make the best use of the vast potential brought about by e-connectivity, the real infrastructure to the rural areas will also have to be built simultaneously
 pichhali sarkaar kaa tarika gramin aabaadi ke saamne revadissan phenkane kaa tha (gaur kiijie aazaadee ke baad in 60 barason main kisaanon ko kis kadar barbaadi kii haalat main daal diya gaya)
 The rural farmer loan waiver scheme was an idea to garner a lot of votes
 manaregaa buniyadi taur par 'pareekshan-kaaryon' kaa kaarykram tha (gambhir krishi sankaton ke dauraan british hukumat tatkaal raahat ke liye pareekshan-kaary shuru karti thi), jisase yahi sabit hua ki 60 barason ke kuraj ne kisaanon ko bheeshan sankat kii haalat main dhakel diya tha
 Nevertheless, it must be said that some good work also happened under MNREGA
 bekaar ke tohfon se taubabima or budhaape kii pension ko sarvasulabh banane kii modi sarkaar kii pahal ko isi roshni main dekhnaa chahie
 These are schemes derived from the visionary strategy, which are full of the possibility of bringing permanent relief and development to the villages instead of throwing waste gifts to the farmers at once
 agar in par acchhee tarah se amal ho to inase gramin ilaakon ke liye doorgaami nattejey ho sakate hai
 No good idea should be allowed to fail
 bank pehle hi jan dhan yojana ke boj ke neeche karaah rahe hai (rashtriyakrut bainkon kii pariklpana gaanvon tak sidhi pahunch ke liye nahin balki keval shahari or ardhashahari ilaakon kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye kii gai thi or isi ke anuroop unhen taiyaar kiya gaya tha), aise main un par or boj daalane kaa nateeja foohad amal ke rup main hi saamne aayega, saath hi vyapaar, udyog or sevaaon ko vitt muhaiyaa karne kii unki bhoomika bhi kamjor pad jaaegi
 Similarly, Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) was not designed for large scale activities covering the entire population including scattered rural areas with low business density
 elisi jin kaamon ke liye taiyaar nahin he, unka boj uske upar daalane se yah kabhi bhi tuutane kii kagaar par pahunch jayega
 We may also have to take out foreign insurance companies that have come to India under the guise of insurance only to trade the mutual funds under the cover of FDI
 ve yahaan khud apane liye or apane amir shahari graahakon ke liye faqat tex ke phaayde hasil karne ke liye hai or unhen kaayade kii bhoomika adaa karne ke liye raji karne kaa bhi koi tarika nahin he
 However, in view of 'havani Fitrat', they should not leave their countryside
 yah behad jaruri he ki digital india kaa phayda uthaate hue nai pranaaliyon or vyavasthaaon ke jariye nai sevaayen gramin ilaakon main pahunchaai jaaen
 This work can neither be left entirely to the new currency bank nor can it be wholly handed over to private sector operators who cannot prove to be different from moneylenders

 Of course, the quality of administration at the Center has improved

 However, it is a matter of great concern that no such force has been used, which can affect the quality of administration of the states, not only in the capitals, but also in the districts and offices below
 tamaam lekhe-jokhon se yahi pataa chalata he ki halaat jas ke tas haih svachh prashasan dene kii kisi bhi mukchaymantri kii na ichha he or na jhukaav; unamem se zyaadaatar ko apane rajnatik jhund ko tusht rakhane kii hi phikr zyada he

 In the end, it would be appropriate to say that it is not possible to reach any conclusion about the functioning of this government on this pedestal
 isaki koshish tak karnaa vaaki uchit nahin he
 At least this much so that the enthusiasm and expectations seen in 2014 are still intact, although they are also a bit blurred
 sarkaar ko kuchhek saal or dena munasib hoga, taaki vah apane pair majbootee se tikaa sake or nitiyon ko amali jama pahana sake

 pakistan ke purv ballebaaj or cricket camentator ramij raja ne team india ke purv captain or maujuuda wicketiper em es dhoni ke grad e contract par sawaal uthaae hai
 Rameez Raja says that the BCCI should not give a grade a contract to MS Dhoni
 kyonki wo ab test cricket nahin khelte hai

 grad e contract un khilaadiyon ko milanaa chahie jo ki test cricket khel rahe hai

 guha ne likhaa tha ki superstar system ne bhartiya cricket kaa kabada kar diya he
 By the way, Rameez Raja also expressed his concern that Test cricket should not be allowed to end in front of the shortest format T20
 ramij raja ne kaha ki asia main cricket tiimon par kaaphi dabaav he, lekin sahi yojana banaai jaae to test cricket championships karai jaae to isse phayda ho saktaa he
 Rameez Raja said that if the Cricket Board does not make such plans for Test cricket, then they will fail to get money in comparison to T20
