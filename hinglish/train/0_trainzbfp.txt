 He has been involved in finding the cause of murder or suicide
 congress ko pehle bhi shikast bhi mili thi, lekin us haar ke baad congress or majboot hokar ubhari
 The defeat forced the party to think and then brought a new strategy, after which it returned to power with double strength
 lekin maujuuda vakt main congress apane sabas bure daur se guzar rahi he
 All the political tricks and tricks are not working
 bade-se-bade ranneetikaar ke paseene chhot rahe hai
 After losing the power of power from the center, Congress is losing state after state
 aise main bade parivartan kii aawaaj congress ke andar se hi buland ho rahi he
 On the other hand, the UP assembly elections next year are nothing short of a litmus test for the party
 jamini str par congressiyon main baicheni he
 From the block level, close to Gandhi family are demanding handover of Priyanka Gandhi in UP
 lekin party pashopesh main he, kyonki iske phaayde ke saath-saath nuksaan kaa dar bhi congress netritv ko sata rahaa he
 3 benefits of Priyanka's coming to the party: 1
 upi main priyanka factor safal hone kii sambhavnapichley vidhansabha chunaav or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main rahul gandhi front par the, chunaav main karaari shikast hui, loksabhaa chunaav main to party amethi-raibareli tak simit hokar rah gai
 In such a situation, if the party is not able to perform well in this barup, then it will have a direct impact in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 or yahi vajah he ki congress ke ranneetikaar prashanth kishor ke saath-saath tamaam diggaj priyanka gandhi ko upi kii kaman saunpane kii maang ek sur main kar rahe hai
 Congress leaders like Digvijay Singh, Kamal Nath, Ghulam Nabi Azad are now demanding big decisions from the party high command
 congressiyon ko priyanka ke aguwai main badlaav kii lahar dikh rahi he
 By the way, Priyanka too is fully aware of the ground reality of amethi-rae Bareli
 saalon se priyanka in donon jagahon par party ke liye vot maangati ai hai
 Priyanka's demand is getting more among the leaders of UP Congress
 kyonki muqabla kadaa he or unhen virdohi kaa palada baari lag rahaa he
 In such a situation, his voice is a splash inside, he feels that Priyanka Gandhi's entry into the field will give a strong comeback to the Congress
 2
 In Priyanka, see the image of Indira, the way the Congress keeps telling her, the public gets connected directly with them
 saath hipriyanka gandhimen congressiyon ko unki daadi indira gandhi kii jhalak dikhti he
 Priyanka also knows very well what the public wants from the Congress
 hansate-hansate virodhiyon par bhi priyanka kaa waar karne kaa andaaj bhi bilkul alag he
 Opponents also feel that if the Congress bets Priyanka in UP, then the Congress will come back strongly in the contest
 isamen do raay nahin he ki priyanka ke aane se congress ko phayda hoga
 By handing over the command to Priyanka, the traditional voters of the Gandhi family will definitely consider returning to the Congress once again
 3
 For Uttar Pradesh's political land Priyanka, four major parties are currently in the election field in Uttar Pradesh
 chunaav se purv inamen kisi tarah ke talmail ke kam asaar hai
 In such a situation, there will be no opinion in this competition
 congress ke liye badi chunauti ye he ki wo upi main bijepi ko kisi tarah se roke
 Because the BJP has already put all its strength in the preparations for the UP elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah Morcha themselves
 lekin agar congress ne priyanka ko upi chunaav main pesh kar diya to bijepi apni ranneeti main badlaav ke liye majaboor ho jaaegi, kyonki priyanka gandhi kii philhal aisi chhavi he jisapar virodhiyon ko hamale se pehle ek baar jarur sochna padegaa
 Not only this, if Priyanka Cord is successful in UP, then a new path will be opened for the Congress in the whole country
 priyanka ke party main aane se do nuksaan:1
 Question on Rahul's political career: Priyanka Gandhi's strength in Congress will shock Rahul Gandhi's mission
 bhale hi upi kii siyasat main priyanka kii entry hogi lekin iskaa sideeffect puure desh main padegaa
 Like UP, the demand for Priyanka will increase in other states as well
 aise main bada sawaal ye hoga ki phir rahul gandhi kaa kya hoga? party is baat se zyadagharabaihe ki gandhi parivaar ke siyaasi vaaris ke taur par kahin priyanka kii pakad majboot hui to isse rashtriya raajnneeti main rahul gandhi kii pakad or dhili pad jaaegi
 The great debate continues in the Congress on this matter
 har pahalu par gaur se vichaar kiya ja rahaa he ki aakhir kaise bich kaa rasta nikaala jaae, jisase party bhi majboot ho or desh main gandhi parivaar kaa ek baar phir varchasv kaayam ho
 2
 priyanka kaa siyaasi anubhavarahul gandhi pichley ek dashak se raajnneeti main puri tarah se sakriy hai, sanghathan ke kaamon ko wo ab bariki se samajhane lage hai
 At the same time, students are also in direct contact with the Congress leaders from all over the country
 aise main priyanka ke puri tarah se raajnneeti main sakriy nahin hone se daanv ulataa pad saktaa he
 That's why some people want Priyanka to spend some time knowing the party's methods
 saath hi virdohi bhi is firaaq main hai ki agar congress main rahul sidline kiye jate hai to unhen congress par hamale kaa mauka mil jayega, vaise main is hamale kaa priyanka kaise jawaab dengi ye bada sawaal he
 At the moment everything rests on the decisions of the Gandhi family
 saath hi kai ranneetikaar is par manthan kar rahe hai, tamaam napha-nuksaan ke aankalan ke baad hi congress kisi bade badlaav ke bare main vichaar karegi
 The 100 days of the Narendra Modi government were completed on Tuesday

 bataa den ki america raashtrapati donald trump ne pakistan ko di jane vaali suraksha sahaayta par pichley maheene roak lagaai thi
 Giving information, the White House said that countries receiving aid from the US cannot be friends of America by supporting or ignoring terrorism
 america kii ore se aise sandesh kaa lambey samay se intjaar kiya ja rahaa tha
 PAK supports terror, is also a victim: US says Trump administration has accused Pakistan of not doing enough in the fight against terrorism, along with the nearly two billion given to it last month Dollar security assistance was also banned
 trump ke haal ke faislon kaa hawala dete hue white house ne unki videsh niti kaa fact shit main vistrut byora dete hue kaha, ‘raashtrapati trump hamaare sahyogiyon ko yah spasht kar rahe hai ki aatank kaa samarthan karke, yaa use andekha karke vah america ke mitra nahin ban sakate
 "after Trump's first State of the Union address on Tuesday, the White House said in the fact sheet," The President halted security aid to Pakistan and thus sent a message to those receiving aid that we expect him to act with terrorism Will be fully with us in the fight
 ’jab america chaatr ko uttar korea ne di 15 saal kii sajapakistan ne aatankwaad ko samarthan dene ke aaropon se inkaar kiya he
 According to the White House, Trump will continue to address the threats posed to America's security and prioritize efforts to combat and defeat radical Islamic terror and its ideology

 The Congress President started his journey from Malaysia and during this time interacted with the people of the Indian community in Kuala Lumpur
 is dauraan unase poocha gaya tha ki vah notebandi ko kaise alag tarah se lagu karte
 To this, Rahul Gandhi said, "if i were the Prime Minister and someone had given me the file of the proposal for demonetisation, i would have thrown it in the garbage can, out of the room or in the junkyard
" rahul gandhi kaha, main is tarah ise (notebandi) lagu karata kyonki mere hisaab se notebandi ke saath aisa hi kiya janaa chahie kyonki yah kisi ke liye bhi acchhee nahin he

 --- input from IANS electronic voting mashiinon (evms) se chhedchhad ke aarope vipakshi partiyaan gaahe-bagaahe lagaati rahati hai
 The ruling party has also been targeted on this issue
 vahiin beete kuch varshon main kam se kam9 deshbhartiyachunaav ayogse electronic voting mashiinon ke liye aagrah kar chuke hai
 This was revealed by a petition under the Right to Information (RTI)
 2009 loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan pehali baar evms ke durupyog ko lekar bade paimaane par raajnneetik aarope saamne aae
 The BJP, which had defeated the Congress-led coalition in that election, accused evms of tampering
 us chunaav ke baad se hi desh main ye raajnneetik nity-karm sa ban gaya he ki jo bhi party chunaav main harati he wo evms kii vishwasaneeyata par sawaal uthaati rahi he
 Whether it is 2014 general elections, state assembly elections, even by-elections, it has been seen everywhere
 2009 chunaav ke evms vivaad ke baad padosi desh nepal ne 2012 main evms kii aapurti kii maang kii thi
 Nigeria in 2014 and Indonesia in 2016 urged the Election Commission of India to do the same
 2017 main chaar deshon ne evms ke liye chunaav ayog se sampark kiya
 These countries are Russia, Bhutan, Botswana and Papua New Guinea
 2018 main afghanistan or namibia ne evms kii aapurti ke liye aagrah kiya
 All these countries preferred to prefer evms' credibility over disputes related to alleged misuse
 chunaav ayog kii ore se mili RTI ke jawaab main bataaya gaya he ki bharat ne sirf do deshon ko teen avasaron par evms kii aapurti kii he
 The reference to the Election Commission has not been cited
 namibia ko 2012 or 2015 main evms kii aapurti kii gai
 Similarly, Bhutan received evms from India in 2017
 baaki sabhi maamalon main chunaav ayog ne yaa to evms / vvpats (voter veriphiable paper audit trails) kii aapurti kaa aagrah khaarij kar diya yaa unki aapurti ko sthagit kar diya
 The adjournment was decided given the current need of evms for elections in India
 haalanki reports ke mutabik nepal or bhutan jaise desh bhartiya evms kaa 2009 se hi kuch chunaavon main istemaal karte rahe hai
 This was also cited by the then Chief Election Commissioner Nasim Zaidi in 2017
 unhone kaha tha ki yadhyapi evms kii nepal, bhutan or namibia jaise deshon ko aapurti kii gai, vahinaustralia, bulgaria, nigeria or rus jaise deshon ne bhi evms ko lekar dilchaspee kaa izhaar kiya
 The Election Commission has stated that evms exported to other countries have different hardware configuration and software code
 saath hi unamem rangon kaa sangyojan, taron (cabals) ke rang, screen printed label bhi duusare tarah ke hote hai
 The RTI reply states that no country has purchased evms with vvpats from India
 artiimen chunaav ayog se ye bhi poocha gaya tha ki evms ke istemaal ko lekar duusare deshon kii kya pratikriya rahi or kya kuch deshon ne istemaal ke baad inhen khaarij bhi kiya
 In response to this question, the Election Commission said that no such information is available

 As part of the bjp's new plan to address the rally in Purulia, CM Yogi will first go to Ranchi by plane, from there to Bokaro by helicopter and then reach Purulia by road
 pichley ravivaar ko baloorghat main yogi ke helicopter ko utarane kii ijazat nahin mili thi, jiske baad unhone telephone ke zarie raily ko sambodhit kiya tha
 For this reason, Yogi has decided to go to West Bengal by road this time
 vahiin helicopter utarane kii ijazat na milane kii vajah se unki bankuda kii prastaavit raily radd ho gai he
 CM Yogi Adityanath's rally in Purulia is to be held around 3 pm today
 bengalaki mamata sarkaar ne unke helicopter ko utarane kii anumati nahin di he

 During this period, 12,021 farmers committed suicide in the state, that is, 8 farmers die every day for the last four years

 Let us tell you that assembly elections are due in Maharashtra by the end of this year
 maharashtra bheeshan sookhaa se jujh rahaa he or upar se kisaanon kii aatmahatya ke aankade behad chintajanak hai
 Relief and Rehabilitation Minister Subhash Deshmukh while answering the question in the Assembly said that between January 2015 and December 2018, 12,021 farmers committed suicide, out of which only 6,888 farmers, ie 57% farmers' families were found eligible for financial assistance
 raahat or punarvaas mantri subhash deshmukh ne bataaya ki rajya sarkaar ne in mritak kisaanon ke parijanon ko ek lakh rupye kii aarthik sahaayta di he
 He said that till now financial assistance has been distributed in 6845 farmer suicides
 saal 2017 main rajya sarkaar ne kisaanon kii karjamaafee kii yojana lekar ai, taaki kisaanon ko tanaav se bachaaya ja sake
 Deshmukh further revealed that 610 farmers committed suicide in the first three months of 2019
 isamen se 192 kisaan sahaayta raashi ke yogya paae gaye hai
 He said that the opposition is trying to surround the Fadnavis government by making farmer suicides an issue
 in aatmahatyaon ke liye sarkaar kii galat policy ko jimmedaar bataaya ja rahaa he
 Speaking on this issue, Jayant Patil said that we have always attracted the government's attention towards the agrarian crisis
 chaahe karj maafee ho yaa fasal rin sabhi jaruratmand chijen kisaanon tak nahin pahunch rahi hai
 Thus, pushing them into more and more financial crisis is leading to such extreme steps
 varisht cabinet mantri subhash deshmukh ne kaha ki sarkaar kisaanon kii aatmahatya ko gambhirtha se le rahi he
 Despite this, if farmers are committing suicide, it is a serious matter for the government
 hamane kisaanon kaa 24 hajaar karod kaa karj maaf kiya he
 Apart from this, small farmers can easily take loans for farming

 isamen bhi rigerv bank main jamaa karaane vahi ja sakenge jinke paas is baat ke pukhta saboot hai ki wo aath november 2017 se ab tak videsh main the lihaaja samay rahete jamaa nahin kar sake

 iske alaava padhai ke dauraan research ke makasad se puraane note rakhane waalon ko bhi chhot hogi, wo adhiktam 25 note rakh sakate hai lekin unhen bhi apni research kaa puraa saboot dena hoga
 Now after 31 March 2017, there will be a ban on keeping more than 10 at a time, whether these notes are 500 or 1000, or both

 rishta nayaa ho purana, kapal ke bich kisi naa kisi baat par nonk-jhonk hoti rahati he
 But many times in anger, people speak such things, which makes their relationship on the verge of breaking up
 isliye chaahe ladaai choti baat par yaa kisi gambhir vishay par aapane partner se jhagadate samay kuch baton ko dhyaan main rakhana behad jaruri hota he
 These are the things that the partner should not say while quarreling
 
 
 1
 'you will not understand' in anger, the ability to understand each other is lost
 jis par kai baar kuch log apane partner ko bol dete hai ki tum nahin samajhoge
 But avoid speaking as much as possible
 kyonki partner ko lag saktaa he ki wo shaayad aapke kaabil nahin he
 So they are missing in understanding you
 jab padane lage rishte main daraar, to aise karaaen partner ko pyaar kaa ahsaas2
 'we Should Breakup' In every relationship, there comes a time when either of the two people in the relationship feels that they should get out of this relationship
 rishte se log itane dukhi ho jate hai ki choti-moti baat hone par hi ladate samay apane partner ko brallep karne ke liye bol dete hai
 But later he regrets his words
 3
 'you are of no use' Never tell your partner that you are of no use
 isse partner ko lagegaa ki aapke jivan main unki koi izzat nahin he or aap unhen kisi laayak nahin samajhate
 Which will cause your relationship problems to increase rather than decrease
 4
 'there is no point in talking to you' During the fight, do not stop the conversation by saying this to the partner
 kyonki kisi bhi baat kaa hal tabhi nikalataa he jab aap shant swabhaav se jhagade ke kaarnon par charchaa kar ke ek duusare ko samajhane kii koshish karte hai
 Know this way, what is the right time to get married! 5
 'tum apane eks ke paas waapas kyon nahin chale jate'jhagada kitna bhi gambhir kyon naa ho
 Never interrupt past relationships
 beete kal ko apane jhagade main laane se paristhitiyaan pehle se zyada bighad sakati hai
 Therefore, be patient while fighting and avoid speaking anything that you will have to regret later

 bharat-pakistan main 2025 tak bad saktaa he vivalmerica kii ek uniwarsity main research main kiya daawaparmaanu yuddh hua to ja sakati he 10 karod kii jaan‘
 
 
 By 2025, India and Pakistan will have more nuclear power
 jammu-kashmir ke masale par donon desh jis tarah aage bad rahe hai, usase donon deshon main bhayankar parmaanu yuddh chhid saktaa he or agar aisa hua to 10 karod log apni jaan ganvaa denge’
 This claim has been made in a report by Rutgers University of America
 jammu-kashmir ke masale par jis tarah ke pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne sanyukt raashtra ke manch par parmaanu yuddh kii dhamkee de daali uske baad duniya kii nazar ek baar phir bharat-pakistan par he
 This is the reason why such research is continuously coming to the fore
 report ke anusaar, jammu-kashmir ke mudde ke kaaran pakistan main baithe aatankwaadi bharat main hamalaa tej kar sakate hai, jinka nishaanaa bharat kii sansad tak ho saktaa he or 2025 main ye maamla puri tarah charam par ja saktaa he
 Due to which India will retaliate on Pakistan, whose capacity will be up to Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (pok), this fight will become the reason for the biggest war in both the countries
 iske anusaar bharat or pakistan ke paas abhi kareeb 150 parmaanu hathiyaar hai, lekin 2025 tak inaki ginati 200 ko paar kar jaaegi
 That is, both countries can have 400-500 weapons
 yahi jang agar chhidati he to parmaanu yuddh kii vajah se kareeb 10 karod logon kii jaan ja sakati he
 Alan Robock, who wrote the report, says that because of the ongoing war on Jammu and Kashmir and the lives of people are dying on the border every month, due to this, this war may one day reach its peak
 is report main is dauraan farvari main donon deshon ke bich hui aar-paar kii ladaai kaa bhi zikr he, jab bharat ke dwaara pakistan main kii gai airstrike se tabaahi machi thi or pakistan ke ladaaku vimaan bharat main aa gaye the
 Research said that around 80 million people were killed in World War 2, but the devastation would surpass the figure of 100 million
 isamen daawa he ki agar do padosi desh jinke paas saikadon kii sankhya main chote parmaanu hathiyaar ho to vah duniya ko daraate hai or bade deshon ko inaki taraf dhyaan dena chahie
 (photo: post-nuclear war situation, advances
 sciencemag
 org) This report assesses the effects of radiation after the nuclear war, vegetation failure, sunlight, shortness of breath, lack of food and drink, and the risk of pandemics
 report kaa kahana he ki agar donon deshon ke bich samjhauta nahin hota he, to dakshin asia main tabaahi kaa sabase kaala itihaas likhaa jayega
 Not only india-pakistan but this entire research has shown the status of some countries of Central Asia including Israel, China, France, Russia, Palestine
 inhen bhi ek khatra bataaya gaya he lekin bharat-pakistan ke masale ko sabase gambhir bataaya gaya he
 Read full university research
 
 
 kya he bharat-pakistan ke bich kaa vivaad?gauratlab he ki jammu-kashmir se bharat ne anuchhed 370 hataane kaa faisla liya, jiske baad pakistan baukhalaayaa he
 Pakistan considers it to be a violation of the rules of the United Nations and is being ridiculed in the world
 imran khan ne to UN ke manch se parmaanu yuddh kii dhamkee di thi or kaha tha ki agar bharat kashmir se karfu nahin hataata he to pulavama jaise hamale bad sakate hai
 If Pakistan is not listened to in the world, there is no way but to lift a gun

 " DGP Somesh Goyal has confirmed the arrest of a total of 6 accused in the gossip gang rape-murder case in Kotkhai, Shimla, Himachal Pradesh
 magar sthaneey log police kii bataai theory se santusht nahin he
 Hence, he is demanding a CBI inquiry into the case
 dijipi goyal ne media se baat karte hue bataaya ki is maamle main 19 saal se lekar 42 saal tak ke aaropee shaamil rahe hai
 DGP said, the police have arrested all the accused from Kotkhai in Shimla
 aropiyon kii pahchaan kotkhai nivasee ashish chouhan (29), rajendra singh urf raju (32), gadhwal nivasee subhash (42) or deepak urf deepu (38), nepal nivasee suraj (29) or lokjan urf chotu (19) ke rup main kii gai he
 The DGP said that the police have strong evidence against the accused
 aropiyon ne apana gunaah bhi kabool kar liya he
 All the accused are being interrogated to open the layers related to the nuances of the crime
 esaiti ne kaaphi behatar tareeke se cese ko suljhaayaa he
 SIT Chief Zahoor Zaidi was also present during the interaction with the media
 kya tha maamlabeeti 4 july ko aaropee rajendra urf raju or apane dost ashish or subhash ke saath spray karne vaali mashin lekar kahin ja rahaa tha
 During this time, he saw the girl student studying in the 10th and stopped the car and asked her to lift her home
 gudiya ilaake main nai ai thi or beete may hi usne skool main daakhila liya tha
 Gudiya knew Raju, so she sat in the car with him
 darasal raju aksar schuli bacchon ko le jaataa tha, jisase gudiya ko bhi us par shaq nahin hua
 According to the police who have drunk alcohol, Raju and his friends were drunk
 isi dauraan unki niyat badali or unhone bich jangal main saamaan utaarne kaa bahaanaa banaate hue gaadi roak di
 After which he gang-raped the innocent
 aropiyon ne apane teen saathiyon ko bhi vahaan bula liya or phir gudiya kii berahami se hatya kar uski laash ko jangalon main phenk diya
 During the gang rapes, the poor had to wait for innocence with the innocent doll
 gudiya ke sharir par mili daanton ke nishandrasal gangrape ke dauraan unhone gudiya ko contili jhaadiyon par phenk diya tha
 Several thorns have been found on the doll's back
 gudiya ke sharir par teen jagah daanton se kaatane ke nishaan mili hai
 All the accused took turns to rape the innocent
 is dauraan unhone gudiya kaa munh dabaae rakhaa, jisase uski maut ho gai
 It is feared that the accused raped the doll even after her death
 iske baad vah log use vahiin nagn haalat main phenkakar faraar ho gaye
 The SIT solved the blind murder case by an accused who knew about the incident but was not involved in it
 uske jariye hi cese kii jaanch kar rahi esaiti is blind cese ke sabhi aropiyon tak pahunch saki
 Even though the police apprehended 6 accused in the gang rape and murder case of innocent dolls, some questions are still not available to the police
 jaiseh1- jab 4 july ko gudiya kii hatya kar di gai thi, to aakhir 6 july tak khoonkhaar junglee-jaanwaron vaale is ilaake main uski laash kaise bachi rahi?2- agar do din tak laash vahaan padi thi to uske haath-pair or puraa sharir bilkul saaf-suthra kaise bachaa rahaa?3- shav ke paas agar uske kapade pade the to ve barish hone ke baavjood vahiin par sahi salaamat kaise the? barish yaa tufaan kaa in par koi asar nahin padaa
 The clothes did not spoil
 4- gangrape ke dauraan chatapataahat kii vajah se gudiya ke haathon or sharir par mitti kyon nahin lagi? police ko mauka-e-vaardaat se koi nishaan kyon nahin mili? pehle khud police bhi ghar yaa gaadi main gangrape kii baat kah rahi thi
 5- Usually, the accused run away after carrying out such a big crime, but in this case, the accused did not run anywhere
 6- jo do nepali yuvak pakade gaye, unke nivas se ghatnasthal kii duuri kareeb 200 meter he
 The question arises that if he had carried out this incident then why would he throw the dead body near his house? However, all these questions are raising questions on the police
 soshal media par log cese kii jaanch sibiai se karwaane or gudiya ke asli gunaahagaaron ke liye faansee kii maang kar rahe hai
 Also, through social media, people have started a campaign to bring justice to the doll
 is ghatana ne samooche himachal pradesh main khalabali machaa di he
 Whether children and older, everyone has come out on the streets demanding justice for the doll

 Styled by @rosepuri_puria post shared by Kapil Sharma (@kapilsharma) on Nov 12, 2017 at 8:29am PST The Committee of Administrators (COA) made it clear that the Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) headed by Kapil Dev would choose the next head coach of the Indian cricket team, but the decision was not unanimous but by a two-to-one majority decision
 Happened
 supreme court kii ore se niyukt sioe ne kaha ki samiti main kisi bhi tarah ke hiton kaa takaraav nahin he
 COA chief Vinod Rai said after the meeting that the committee has looked into the announcements submitted by members Kapil Dev, Anshuman Gaikwad and Shanta Rangaswamy and has been allowed to choose the coach
 lekin ab aisi khabaren aa rahi hai ki yah faisla sarvasammati ke aadhaar par nahin liya gaya he
 Sources privy to the COA meeting told IANS that Vinod Rai and Lt Gen Ravi Thoz were not of the same opinion
 lekin aisa mana ja rahaa he ki sadasyon ke khilaaf hiton ke takaraav kaa koi maamla nahin tha, jabaki dyna adulji chaahati thim ki lokapal dike jain hi is bare main koi faisla len
 Sources said, "rai and Thoz were unanimous that the announcements made by the three-member committee were very good
 lekin dyna ne mahasoos kiya ki is par lokapal dwaara hi koi faisla lenaa uchit hoga, taaki hiton ke takaraav maamle kii andekhi na ho or baad main koi maamla na saamne aae
 Rai said, 'we have seen it and it is fine

 The cac's decision in this matter will be final

 Meanwhile 26 state associations have accepted the new constitution of BCCI and appointed Election Officer
 raay ne ummid jataai ki chunaav ke samay tak yah sankhya 30 tak ho sakati he
 He once again made it clear that the unions which have not implemented the BCCI constitution, will not be allowed to vote
 sioe ke pramukh ne kaha, '26 rajyon ne ise lagu kar diya he or nirvachan adhikari kaa chunaav kar liya he
 The right to vote will be given only to those states which have implemented it

 Describing the Pakistani system as highly unstable, corrupt and militaristic, he said that Pakistan's elite governance system is completely double-conduct and Indian people feel that the West is playing in the wrong hands by making Islamabad a friend

 If you look at it from the Indian side, you will know that Pakistan has always been giving shelter to terrorism

 However Article 35A was incorporated through an order of the President in 1954 to define permanent residents and grant them the right to acquire property, vote in elections and obtain government jobs
 is praavdhaan kaa sansad se anumodan nahin karaayaa gaya tha or isi aadhaar par ise supreme court main chunauti di gai he
 Of a former bureaucrat who had worked long with the Jammu and Kashmir Public Service Commission

 Says Jandial, "the President does not have the right to add new provisions like Article 35A as was the case with Article 35A
 ''so, ab court ke saamne ahm sawaal yah he ki kya raashtrapati ke paas sansad kii andekhi kar samvidhan main ek nayaa anuchhed jod dene kaa adhikaar he? vaise anuchhed 370 (1) (di) jammu-kashmir sarkaar kii sahmati se hi sahi, raashtrapati ko aisi shakti pradaan karata prathit hota he
 Whatever it is, people have started giving their decisions
 ththjammu-kashmir ekmaatr aisa rajya nahin he jo vishesh kanoonon ke jariye suraksha upayon se las he
 11 states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Goa, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Mizoram, Manipur, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka are also protected under Articles 371, 371A to 371J

 Whatever he threw at him to control Pakistan, he did not appear to learn any lesson from it and kept coming back for more severe punishment
 niyantran rekha (elosi) par isse pehle mushkil se hi kabhi is kadar tanatani or dushmani dekhi gai, jahaan hindustan or pakistan kii fujen 2003 main us vakt se hi bunker-dar-bunker ek duusare ke aamane-saamne khadi hai, jab sangharsh-viraam samjhauta hua tha
 This agreement also seems dead
 pichley saal niyantran rekha par ek din main ausatan teen sangharsh-viraam ulanghan hue, yahaan tak ki sardiyon ke dinon main bhi, jab barf kii moti chadar kii vajah se paaramparik taur par seemaa-paar ghuspaith kam ho jaati he
 Even in the new year, it did not decrease at all
 pichley hafte tanaav or bad gaya jab dehshatgardon ne jammu main sunjavaan army camp par hamalaa bol diya or is hamale main is mishan ko anjaam dene vaale teen dehshatgardon ke alaava paanch sainya karmi or ek naagarik kii jaan chali gai
 With this, though another terrorist attack on the CRPF camp in Srinagar was thwarted, a soldier lost his life in it
 saaf tha ki bharat kaa dhairya chuk rahaa tha
 At a press conference in Jammu, Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who was seen as sad, accused Pakistan of plotting a sunset attack and warned, "pakistan will pay the price for its blight
" "bada sawaal yah he, bharat aakhir kis had tak ja saktaa he taaki pakistan ko is kism kii ''himakaton" kii keemat adaa karne ke liye majaboor kar sake? kya nai dilli ke paas islamabad kii pantarebaaji kaa muqabla karne ke liye koi gemplan he? kya koi aakhri or nirnaayak baaji he?in sawaalon ke koi aasaan jawaab nahin hai
 When Pakistan sits with India to play this game of tension, it believes that it has some top class cards in its hand
 unamem se ek kashmir main uskaa rasookh or asar or hurriyat sareekhe apane evagiyon ke jariye ghati ko lagaataar ashaanti main jhonke rakhane kii uski kaabiliyat he
 Its second ace is the jihadi factions like lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammed, which have been raised by the ISI to carry out terrorist attacks on their own free will
 teesraa, china ke saath apni sadabahaar dosti ke rishton ko majboot karne kii islamabad kii koshishen or beijing kii mahashakti banane kii mahatvakanksha kii khatir uske taabedaar kii tarah bartaav karne kii uski tatparta he
 Fourth, Pakistan's independence is important for the US in its quest to find a way out of Afghanistan's mess
 paanchvaan, pakistan kii sarvashaktimaan fouj he, jo asli bos he, or dushmani ke badhane ke khilaaf hindustan ko aagaah karne ke liye apane parmaanu asalhe ko bhaanjane ke liye hameshaa taiyaar baithi rahati he
 And the sixth ace is Pakistan's pressure to be among the largest Muslim countries in the world — and even among them the only country with nuclear bombs
 to kya modi sarkaar ke paas koi aisi turup he, jo pakistan kii akad ke peeche kaam kar rahe in ikkon se badhkar ho or unhen pachhad sake? modi ko is baat kaa gaharaa ehsaas he ki pakistan ke saath rishton ko sanbhaalanaa kisi bhi hindustani pradhanmantri kii videsh niti kii sabase ahm praathamikta he
 Every Indian Prime Minister, from Jawaharlal Nehru till now, has been hoping that he would be able to convince Pakistan of peaceful co-existence with India
 sansad main spasht bahumat se las bhaajapa ke pehle pradhanmantri hone ke naate modi pakistan ke saath kargar rishta tay karne kii apni koshishon main kam josho-kharosh se bhare nahin rahe hai
 This is also when he has made efforts to weaken the pillars supporting Pakistan's strength, in which he has so far achieved little success
 unhen is baat kaa shrey dena hoga ki kaman sambhalate hi unhone bharat ke majboot pakshon ke dam par khelnaa shuru kar diya tha
 These included being the world's largest effective democracy and the world's fastest growing economy, as well as India's secure status on the top table of nations
 modi ke liye yah jaruri or ahm tha ki ve hindustan ko ek aise desh kii taur par pesh karen jo pakistan kii taraf dosti kaa haath badhaane ke liye hameshaa tatpar he, vahiin apane padosi desh kii taraf ungali bhi uthaaen or bade mahashakti deshon se uske khilaaf kadam uthaane kaa aagrah bhi karen
 Despite his aggressive attitude towards Pakistan, Modi along with other SAARC leaders at his swearing-in ceremony had surprised the world by calling Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
 uske baad jaldi hi modi ne rishton ke niyamon ko badalanaa shuru kar diya, jab unhone pakistan ke ucchayukta abdul basit dwaara hurriyat ko shaamil karke agenda tay karne kii koshish karne par sachiv str kii baatcheet ko radd kar diya
 The message was clear, i am ready to start the dialogue process again, but there will be no place for the third party of stakeholders on the negotiating table — either there will be a government-to-government interaction, or there will be no dialogue
 phir jammu-kashmir par sarkaar kii pakad majboot karne ke liye modi ne april 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main aae khandit faisle ke baad gathbandhan sarkaar banane kii garaj se pidipi ke saath bhaajapa kaa gathbandhan kaayam kiya
 In the meantime, he attacked Hindustan and himself on global forums, presenting himself with such power that would have to be taken seriously, and with all the big countries including America and China
 itani hi ahm baat yah ki modi ne un muslim deshon ke saath bhi najdiki rishte banane shuru kiye jinhen pakistan apane doston main ginata tha—saudi arab, yuai, katar or oman
 And in the backyard of Pakistan, he strengthened India's relations with Afghanistan and Central Asian countries
 is sabake peeche koshish yah thi ki apane phaayde ke liye muslim card khilne kii pakistan kii kshamta ko kamjor kiya jaae
 In 2015, Modi made several serious efforts to bring Pakistan to the negotiating table
 unhone tatkaaleen videsh sachiv es
 Jaishankar was sent to Islamabad to talk to Pakistan's foreign secretary
 phir rus ke shahar upha main unki sharif se kaaphi sauhardpurn baatcheet hui
 Both leaders agreed that their national security advisors should meet
 lekin us koshish ko bhi jhatka laga
 Terrorists from across the border attacked a bus in Gurdaspur and targeted a police station, killing seven people
 uske baad dilli main rashtriya suraksha salaahkaaron ke bich baatcheet isliye roak di gai ki pakistan apane rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar kii hurriyat netaaon se baatcheet par ad gaya
 However, Modi's relationship with Sharif continued and when the two leaders met during the climate change conference in Paris, they agreed to meet their national security advisors in the impartial country of Thailand
 modi ek kadam aage bade or christmas diwas ko sharif kii nathin kii shaadi main achaanak lahore pahunch gaye
 In this way, Sharif's arrival at his swearing-in ceremony was repaid
 lekin jaldi hi pakistan main bharat se shanti na chaahane vaale tatv harakat main aa gaye
 Barely a week after Modi's visit to Lahore, on January 2, 2016, jaish-e-mohammed militants attacked the Pathankot air base
 uske baad to bharat-pakistan rishte gart main pahunch gaye
 Meanwhile, tensions began to emerge in the PDP-BJP alliance and Pakistan intensified its efforts to create massive unrest in the Valley
 july main burhan vaani kii maut ke baad to ghati main sabase badtareen maahaul ban gaya or suraksha balon ko kanoon-vyavastha banaae rakhane ke liye kadi mashkkat kerani padi
 Pakistan's hand was well known in this
 tab modi ne kadaa rukh apana liya
 In the Independence Day speech, he discussed the "screams of freedom of the people" of Pakistan's sensitive gilgit-baltistan and Balochistan
 iskaa saaf makasad pakistan ko yah sandesh dena tha ki pakistan ke maamalon ko bhi bhunaaya ja saktaa he
 When the terrorists from Pakistan launched the second major attack in Uri in September 2016, the army was shocked
 us hamale ke das din ke bheetar modi ne elosi ke paar aatanki shiviron par sargical strike kaa aadesh de diya
 The message to Pakistan was that we can play this game better than you
 china ke samarthan se josh main pakistan ne yah sabit karne ke liye elosi par garmi badha di ki sargical strike se uske hausale post nahin hue hai
 But to the surprise of Pakistan, the Indian Army intensified its action and the phase of retaliation increased
 kashmir main suraksha balon ne pramukh aatankwaadiyon ko nishaanaa banaakar or seemaa paar se ghuspaith rokkar kuch badhat hasil kii (dekhen saath kii report)
 Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump bluntly told Pakistan that he should desist from his methods
 islamabad ko sujh nahin rahaa tha ki kya jawaab de
 The Pakistani military was under pressure from the US to give a concession on the Afghan border
 use apni aantarik uthal-puthal ko shant karne ke liye bhi elosi par kashmiri jehadi guton ko khush rakhana pad rahaa tha
 Then Pakistan also hopes that if tensions rise from India, Trump may think of interfering in Kashmir
 to, is khun-kharabe ke baad maamla kya rahegaa? jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki kashmir kaa masalaa ansulajhaa hi rahegaa, yani iskaa ant kisi bhi karrwai se nahin hone vaala he
 Former National Security Advisor Shivshankar Menon believes that there is no long-term permanent solution in the case of Pakistan, the question is "how can you maintain the relationship in such a situation
" "dusron kii raay he ki ab dwipaksheeya maamla bhi nahin rah gaya kyonki ab is maamle main bharat or pakistan, pakistan or afghanistan, or america or pakistan ke bich baari ghalmail ho gaya he
 What happens next? After Sharif was forced to leave the throne in July 2017, the period of political instability will end only in the general elections scheduled this summer
 pakistani faujee hukmran sharif bhaaiyon se jahiraa taur par naakhush hai or ve shaayad imran khan kii aguai main kisi kamjor sarkaar ko pasand karen, jise ungaliyon par nachaaya ja sake
 There is no leader of such stature till the end of elections for India, to speak for the restoration of peace
 jaisaa ki pakistan main bhartiya ucchayukta rah chuke sharat sabharwal kehete hai, ''yah bharat ke liye koi badi pahal karne ke lihaaj se bura vakt he
 There is also a discussion of "a dangerous moment in some circles"
 yani modi sarkaar ko agar lagata he ki uske dobaaraa chunaav jeetne kii sambhaavnaaen dhoomil ho rahi hai to vah rajnatik phaayde ke liye ek choti jang bhi ched sakati he
 But Modi is so sensible that to win an election, one should not take such a risk, which can even slip away
 pakistan ke paas kashmir naamak bada ikkaa he or bharat vahaan ashaanti dabaane ke liye takat ke istemaal se use mauka bhi de rahaa he
 India will have to think this
 uske paas vikalp yahi he ki vah khufia tantra majboot kare, kashmir main aman behaal kare or pakistan se rishte sahaj karne kii soche

 regami ne 21 june ko hone vaale chunaavon kii dekharekh ke liye gathit antarim sarkaar ke pradhan kaa yah padbhaar sambhala he
 Four major parties in the country, including the United Democratic Madheshi Front (UDMF), signed an 11-point political consensus document aimed at forming a government to oversee elections under the leadership of the Chief Justice during a lengthy meeting, followed by the 63-year-old Regmi
 Sworn in as head of interim government
 raashtrapati rambaran yadav ne raashtrapati bhawan main yojit ek samaaroh main regami ko pad evam gopneeyata kii shapath dilaai, jiske baad navaniyukt pradhanmantri ne cabinet ke do nae mantriyon ko shapath grahan karai

 It was also agreed to hold fresh elections on 21 June by removing all legal hurdles between political parties
 samjhaute par hastakshar karne vaale mukhya dalon ke sheersh netaaon main nepal kii communist party (maovadi) ke pramukh prachand, nepali congress ke adhyaksh susheel koirala, communist party of nepal-uniphoid marxist leninist ke adhyaksh jhalanaath khanal or joint democratic madheshi front ke pratinidhi bijay kumaar gandhar shaamil the
 This is the first time in Nepal's political history when the current Chief Justice has been made the head of government
 ek varsh pehle sansad kaa kaarykaal samaapt hone ke baad paidaa hua gatirodh regami ke chayan ke saath samaapt ho gaya
 Elections were to be held in November last year after the end of the term of Parliament but were canceled due to political differences
 tippaniyan Nepali Congress President Sushil Koirala said after the swearing-in ceremony that the formation of an interim government under the leadership of the Chief Justice would not only provide a way out of the current political deadlock, but would also help strengthen the democracy of the country

 (input bhashaa se) According to Hindu calendar, the festival of Rakshabandhan, celebrated on the full moon day of Shravan month, signifies brotherly love
 is maukey par bahanen bhaaiyon kii dahini kalai main raakhi baandhti hai, tilak lagaati hai or unase apni raksha kaa sankalp leti hai
 On this day, you do not need to do anything to celebrate your sister and brother, in fact it is something where everyone forgets their grievances
 is tyohaar ko puure bharatvarsh main behad dhoomdhaam se manaaya jaataa he
 In Rakshabandhan festival, Rakshasutra i
e
 Rakhi can range from raw yarn to colorful artifacts, silk yarn and expensive items like gold or silver
 lekin is paavan tyohaar main rakshasutra yaa raakhi se adhik mahatv us bhaavana kaa he, jis pavitra bhaavana ke tahat bahanen bhaiyon ko raakhi baandhti hai
 It is said that on the occasion of Rakshabandhan, the priests go to the house of the priests and tie a rakhi to them, in return for which the priests give alms to the priests and provide food
 rakshasutra baandhte samay purohit ek shloke kaa uccharan karte hai, kaha jaataa he ki is shloke kaa sambandh raja bali kii vachanabaddhata se judaa he
 'yen Bandho Bali: King Danvendro Mahabal:
 ten tvambhibadhnami rakshe maa chal maa chal’ rakshabandhan kaa mantra he
 Which means that the protector with which the great powerful Danavendra king Bali was tied, i bind you with the same Rakshabandhan that will protect you
 rakshabandhan bhai or bahan kii atmiyata or sneh ke bandhan se rishton ko majbooti dene vaala tyohaar he
 Perhaps this is the reason that there is a trend to tie rakhi on this festival not only to sister brother but also in other relations
 rakshabandhan ke maukey par special dishes bhi banaai jaati hai jaise ghevar, shakarpaare, namakpaare
 Ghevar is a special sweet of Saavan, it is made only by confectioners
 kuch log is tyohaar ke maukey par shakarpaare or namakpaare apane ghar par bhi banaate hai
 The comments rakshabandhan ko shravan maheene main manaaya jaataa he
 For this reason it is also known as Shravani (savani) or Saluno
 is baar rakshabandhan ke din chandragrahan bhi pad rahaa he aise main samay se apane bhai ko raakhi baandhna na bhoolen
 11 in the morning
 07 baje se dopaher 1
 50 am is the auspicious time for Raksha Bandhan
 rakshabandhan ke tyohaar main rakshasutra yani raakhi kachche soot se lekar rangeen kalave, reshmi dhaage or sone yaa chaandi jaisi mahangi vastu tak kii ho sakati he
 But in this holy festival, more important than Rakshasutra or Rakhi is the spirit under which sisters tie Rakhi to brothers
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki rakshabandhan ke maukey par purohit yajmaanon ke ghar jate hai or unhen raakhi baandhte hai, jiske badale main yajmaan purohiton ko dakshina dete hai or bhojan karaate hai
 While chanting the Rakshasutra, the priests chant a verse, which is said to be related to the commitment of King Bali
 ‘yen baddho bali: raja danvendro mahabal:
 Ten Tvabhibhidhnami Rakshe Ma Chala Ma Chal 'is the mantra of Rakshabandhan
 jiskaa arth he jis rakshasutra se mahaan shaktishaalee danvendra raja bali ko baandha gaya tha, usee rakshabandhan se main tumhen baandhta hum jo tumhaari raksha karegaa
 Rakshabandhan is a festival that strengthens relationships with the bonding of affinity and affection of brother and sister
 shaayad yahi kaaran he ki is tyohaar par na keval bahan bhai ko hi balki anya sambandhon main bhi raakhi baandhne kaa chalan he
 On the occasion of Rakshabandhan, special dishes are also made such as ghevar, shakarpare, namkepare
 ghevar sawan kii special mithai he yah keval halavaiyon dwaara hi banaaya jaataa he
 Some people also make sweet potato and saltpeter at their home on the occasion of this festival
 tippaniyan Rakshabandhan is celebrated in the month of Shravan
 is kaaran ise shrawani (saavnee) yaa saluno bhi kaha jaataa he
 This time a lunar eclipse is also happening on the day of Rakshabandhan, so do not forget to tie a rakhi to your brother in time

 atarni general ji i vaahnavati ne aaj sifarish kii he ki sen ke istife ke baavjood prakriya jari rahani chahie
 Questions were raised about the possibility of impeachment process in Lok Sabha after Justice Sen resigned President Pratibha Patil on Thursday
 samajha jaataa he ki atarni general vaahnavati ne sarkaar ko suzav diya he ki prakriya shuru ho chuki he isliye ise rokane ke bare main sochane par kaaphi der ho gayi he
 Official sources said that Law Minister Salman Khurshid has termed Vahanvati's suggestion as valid
 ucch padasth sutron ne bataaya ki vaahnavati kaa maananaa he, ‘nyaayamurti sen ke viruddh loksabhaa main nirdhaarit kaarykram ke anusaar mahabhiyog prastaav par kaarywahi ko aage badhaayaa jaae
 According to the scheduled program, impeachment proceedings are to be initiated against Sen in the Lok Sabha on Monday
 kaarywahi aparaahn do baje shuru hogi
 The impeachment motion was discussed against him on 17 and 18 August in the Rajya Sabha, which was passed by the House by two-thirds of the vote
 sutron ke anusaar sarkaar ke is varishthatam vidhik adhikari kaa kahana he ki agar loksabhaa main mahabhiyog ke prastaav ko nahin liya gaya to sen ko hataane ke do saal se kiye ja rahe prayaas ‘vyarth’ ho jaaenge
 In the current session of Parliament itself, the Attorney General has advocated that the proceedings in the Lok Sabha should be carried out as per the prescribed schedule, failing which the action taken in this context in the Rajya Sabha will go in vain
 vaahnavati kaa tark he, ‘sansad ke ek satr main hi donon sadanon ko mahabhiyog prastaav ko paarit karnaa chahie
 Sources said that the Attorney General has made Article 124 (4) of the Constitution the basis for this recommendation

 The President sent him to the Justice Department to get an opinion on Sen's resignation

 After retiring from the Test format, Dhoni's performance in odis and T20 formats is now under the scanner and captain Dhoni will be worried about his own performance in this series
 pichley kuch samay se dhoni kaa balla kaaphi shant rahaa he or duniya ke best finishr ke unke rutabe par iskaa asar bhi hua he
 He has always been brilliant as a captain, but his performance as a batsman in the last one year has been nothing special
 tippaniyan In the last 12 months in 19 odis, his bat scored 453 runs
 ausat to 41
 18, but during this time he did not appear in his old color
 - ipel aate-aate unka form or gira or 17 maichon main vah sirf 372 ran bana paae 31 kii ausat se or sirf ek hi ardhashatki pari is dauraan vah laga paae
 All these know that the series against Bangladesh is not going to be easy
 khaskar agar bangla tigers kaa pichley ek saal kaa pradarshan dekhen to ye chunauti kathin nazar aati he, lekin captain dhoni samet kai vanade team ke sipaahi bangladesh pahunch gaye hai or abhyaas main jute gaye hai
 There is a new tour so the captain does not want the old mistakes to be repeated
 dhoni ab test team kaa hissaa nahin hai
 He no longer needs to change his batting for this format
 bangladesh daure par jane se pehle dhoni ne apane puraane andaaz ko waapas laane ke liye dilli main apane puraane coach ke saath jamkar abhyaas kiya or agar dhoni bangladesh main phir se apni puraani lay main aae to fir unhen roak paanaa kisi ke bas kii baat nahin hogi
 Dhoni's bat has been quiet for quite some time now and it has also affected his status as the world's best finisher
 bataur captain to vah hameshaa shandaar rahe hai, lekin pichley ek saal main bataur ballebaaz unka pradarshan kuch khaas nahin rahaa
 The comments - pichley 12 maheenon main vanade ke 19 muqablon main unke balle se 453 ran nikle
 Average 41
 18 kaa he, lekin is dauraan vah apane puraane rang main nazar nahin aae
 His form further deteriorated in the IPL and he was able to score only 372 runs in 17 matches at an average of 31 and only one half-century during this period
 -bangladesh ke khilaaf siries aasaan nahin hone vaali ye sab jaanate hai
 Especially if we look at the performance of Bangla Tigers for the last one year, this challenge seems tough, but many ODI team soldiers including captain Dhoni have reached Bangladesh and are engaged in practice
 nayaa daura he isliye captain nahin chaahate ki puraani galatiyon ko doharaaya jaae
 Dhoni is no longer a part of the Test team
 is formet ke liye apni ballebaazi main kiye badlaav kii ab unhen jarurat nahin he
 Before going on tour to Bangladesh, Dhoni practiced fiercely with his old coach in Delhi to bring back his old style and if Dhoni comes back to his old rhythm again in Bangladesh, then it will not be a matter of anyone to stop him

 bharat ke pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne united neshans general assembly ke dauraan kaha ki pakistan aatankwaad kaa centre he, to pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif ne kathith rup se bhartiya piem ko 'dehati aurat' kah daalaa
 Nawaz Sharif gave the disputed statement off-the-record to news anchor Hamid Mir of Pakistan news channel Geo TV
 manmohan singh ne kaha ki pakistan kii dharti par aatankwaad ko panaah mil rahi he or is vishay par unki charchaa america ke raashtrapati baraak obama se bhi hui
 While discussing this, Sharif told Mir, 'manmohan Singh is raising this issue like a' rural woman '
 ' mir ne bataaya is brifing ke dauraan bharat kii ek mahila patrkaar bhi vahaan maujuud thi
 Nawaz Sharif had given this statement in the context that the way the rustic women always reach the third with each other's quarrel, in the same way Manmohan reaches the US with the india-pakistan quarrel
 iske baad mir ne ek bhartiya channel ko die intervyuu main kaha ki sharif ne bahut halke andaaj main aisa kaha tha

 After the Kargil war in 1999, the general removed Sharif from the post through a military coup after differences between Sharif and the then army chief General Pervez Musharraf
 pakistani pradhanmantri ne kaha ki vah maanate hai ki agar bharat or afghanistan main shanti he to pakistan main bhi shanti hogi
 Sharif is believed to have addressed the pakistani-american community saying that his government is in favor of a policy of peace and non-interference with India and Afghanistan

 The tantrik's ruthlessness did not stop here, he dragged the pregnant woman's hair to the floor
 lambey vakt tak ye tamaasha aspataal parisar main hi chalata rahaa, lekin kisi ne bhi tantric ko rokane kii jahamat nahin uthaai
 In fact, 25-year-old Archana of Sagar, MP, was admitted to the Bundelkhand Medical College due to deteriorating health

 There could not have been a better opportunity for Rahul Gandhi to garner fresh headlines in Uttar Pradesh
 isliye congress mahasachiv ne pichley hafte pulisia aatank se peedit gaanv bhattha parsul pahunchane main deree nahin lagaai
 And when he was preparing to sit on a dharna in the village late night with some party leaders and activists like Digvijay Singh, he was told that he had been arrested
 lekin raat kareeb ek baje jab unhen police adheekshak rakesh joli or esadm vishaal singh scorpiyo gaadi main lekar greater noida kii sadakon par chale to congress ke is yuvaraj ne unase poocha, ''meri giraftaar ke kagajaat kahaan hai?''phir unhen thane le jaaya gaya or bataaya gaya ki dand prakriya samhita kii dhara-151 ke tahat giraftaar karne par kisi kagajaat kii jarurat nahin rahati, phir bhi ve kagajaat ke liye ade rahe kyonki kaayade se 151 ke tahat giraftaar shaks ko band par dastakhat karne ke baad hi choda jaataa he
 But when he asked "how many people will be arrested?" Will arrest the whole country? ”and made it clear that“ People have been fighting, they will keep fighting ”

 lekin yah ghatana vidhansabha chunaav se saal bhar pehle centre main sattarudh us party ke kaaryakartaaon main praan foonkane kii pahal sabit hui he jo badi koshishon ke baad bhi sushuptavastha main najar aati thi
 After this incident, the state's Chief Minister Mayawati was shocked by the reactions across the state
 agle din jab congress ke log pradesh bhar main dharne-pradarshan karke giraftaaryaan de rahe the to bahujan samaaj party supremeo ne lakhanu main press conference kar kaha, ''lagata he, unki apni party main unki chal nahin rahi he, isiilie uttar pradesh main aakar drama kar rahe hai
 He also said in a threatening manner that those who spread unrest will be strictly dealt with
 is tarah ek maharani or ek yuvaraj ke bich vakyuddh pradesh main raaj kar rahi basapa or centre main raaj kar rahi congress ke bich ek aisi jang main tabdeel hota dikh rahaa he jisaki congress ko lambey samay se darkaar thi
 The next day of Rahul's arrest, Congress workers made arrests after protests across the state and this phase is still going on
 aakraamak vipakshi party ke taur par apni pahchaan banane ke liye party ne saal bhar chalane vaale kai kaarykram banaae hai or agle hafte 18-19 taarikh ko varanasi main pradesh party kaaryakartaaon kaa sammelan yojit kiya gaya he jahaan party adhyaksh sonia gandhi or rahul kii maujuudagi main vidhansabha chunaav varsh se jude in kaaryakramon ko antim rup diya jane vaala he
 However, this battle of land starting from kiln Parsaul could prove to be the beginning of preparations for next year's assembly elections
 pradesh sarkaar ke chaar saal puure ho gaye hai or agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye har party qamar kas chuki he
 What is troubling for the Congress is that while it has ruled at the Center during 1991-96 as well, it has been ruling since 2004, but in a politically most powerful state in the country, its condition is so bad that 1989 He has no luck after the throne
 yahaan party kabhi sapa to kabhi basapa kii pichhalggu ban kar rahi he or aksar yah tay nahin kar paati ki in donon main uskaa dushman number ek koun he
 She has often been adopting a strategy to hunt one by mixing one of these, but in this strategy she has become a victim of her own
 is samay 403 sadasyon vaali vidhansabha main uske mahaj 20 vidhayak hai or bhaajapa, sapa or basapa na keval uske janaadhar ko tukdon-tukdon main chat kar gai hai, balki uske vidhayakon ko bhi hajam karti rahi hai
 By the way, the Congress has 58 lakh members in the state, but their hard work is not reflected in any election
 haalanki loksabhaa main rajya ke 80 main se 22 sadsy uske hai, par varsh 2009 ke chunaav main hui unki jeet rajya main voton ke vibhaajan kaa nateeja maani gai thi
 It is not surprising then that the party's plight in the state that sent Sonia and Rahul to the Lok Sabha salutes these members of the Nehru family
 isiilie uttar pradesh main party kaa punarutthan rahul gandhi kaa agenda number ek he
 Over the years, he has been feeding the dust of villages in Uttar Pradesh, from former British Foreign Minister David Miliband to Microsoft chief Bill Gates
 kisaanon or bunakaron ke masale ko unhone sansad main uthaaya to bundelkhand anchal ko to unhone maano prayogbhumi bana rakhaa he
 They have also demanded to make it a separate state
 pichley dinon hi pradhanmantri manmohan singh or rahul ne bundelkhand anchal ke banda main raily kii or rajya sarkaar par kai aarope lagaae
 In this way, while sonia-rahul's visits in the early years after the 2007 assembly elections were rarely outside amethi-rae Bareli i
e
 her Lok Sabha constituencies, now she has broken this scope
 saath hi, chunki is samay unka jor khaas kar un dalit or musalmaan matadaataaon ko congress kii ore aakarshith karnaa ho gaya he, jo mote taur par basapa ke saath samajhe jate hai, to mayawati kaa agbabula hona lajimi hi he
 Obviously the coming year will be most important for Rahul
 unhone yuvak congress kii sadsyta kaa abhiyaan chalaa rakhaa he or party sadsyta main herapheri rokane or vaastavik sadsy banane ke liye kai upaay kiye ja rahe hai
 The campaign was completed in many districts of the state, while in the western districts it has started only last week
 party ko apane kaaryakartaaon ko sadak par utaarne ke liye muddon kii talash thi to greater noida main kisaanon ke utpeedan se unhen yah mudda bhi haath lag gaya he
 It is said that all mps and other prominent leaders have been asked to suggest two or three seats of their choice where candidates will be given their choice and it is their responsibility to win them
 itnaa hi nahin, party ne rajdhani lakhanu se lekar jila str tak apane kaaryakartaaon ko nirdesh die hai ki ve centre dwaara pryojit yojanaon ke kriyanvayan main khaamiyon kaa khulaasa karwaane ke liye suchanadhikaar kanoon kaa phayda uthaaen
 While Rahul and State Congress President Rita Bahuguna Joshi have recently issued an information application in Lucknow seeking information about the implementation of the National Rural Health Mission, the party workers have made hundreds of such applications
 gauratlab he ki pichley dedh saal main yah rahul gandhi kaa uttar pradesh kaa 9waan daura tha
 And while he goes to every region of the state, his mother and Congress president Sonia also does not miss the confrontation
 do saal pehle unhen jab raibareli main raily karne se roka gaya to ve vahiin dharne par baith gayi thim
 It is no surprise that the BJP and SP were also surprised by the speed with which Rahul took up the issue of harassment of farmers
 bhaajapa ke diggaj netaa laalkrishna adwani or party saansad varun gandhi tak ne rahul kii tarif kii or jhenp mitaane ke liye bhaajapa netaaon ne bhi agle din upwas kaa aayojan kiya, vah bhi ghatnasthal se dur gajiabad main
 Even SP and Rashtriya Lok Dal, which do politics of farmers, could not show the same speed as Rahul in this case
 haalanki mayawati ne jab hamalaa bolaa ki ''bhu-adhigrahan vidheyak ko centre sarkaar aage kyon nahin badhati?'' to agle hi din kendriya grih mantri pi
 Chidambaram said, "this bill will be introduced in the monsoon session of Parliament
" ''par kya agle maah apana 41waan janm din manaane ja rahe rahul kii teji hi rajya main party kaa punarutthan kar degi? abhi jahaan basapa or mukhya vipakshi dal sapa ne apane teen chauthai ummidavaar ghoshit kar die hai or apni chunavi ladaai ko jameen par le ja chuki hai, vahiin congress or bhaajapa donon hi abhi upree hawa banane main lagi hai
 BJP had also organized half a dozen Mahasangram rallies in the state in the past, while the Congress is now on the road
 abhi jahaan basapa 226 vidhansabha siton par he, vahiin sapa ke paas 87 siten hai
 The BJP, which came out of power in the year 2002, is constantly getting away from it and currently holds 48 seats, while RLD has 10 seats and 10 seats are held by independents and others
 vaise, party vidhayak dal ke netaa pramod tiwari kehete hai, ''is baar ham sarkaar banane ke liye lard rahe hai

 He is expected to get 15 to 16 seats this time
 bataa den ki saal 2014 ke aam chunaav main udief ne kerala kii 20 loksabhaa siton main se 12 seat par kabja kiya tha
 If we talk about assembly elections 2016, UDF was expected to get 9 seats here this time
 agsit pole ke mutabik kerala main sipiai / sipiem ke left democratic front (ldf) kii siten ghat sakati hai
 The LDF hopes to get 3 to 5 seats here
 bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav-2014 main ldf ne yahaan 8 jite par paracham laharaaya tha

 It is worth noting that in 2014 general elections, NDA did not get a single seat in Kerala
 to vahiin 2016 vidhansabha chunaav ke pradarshan ke aadhaar par bhi endie ko shunya seat milane ko anumaan tha
 So at the same time, like the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, this time too, no sheet is expected

 The LDF received a 31 per cent vote share in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 lekin agsit pole main is baar use 38 fisadi vot share milane kii baat kahi gai he
 If we talk about the 2016 assembly elections, LDF would have got 40 per cent vote share this time but on this basis the vote share of LDF seems to be decreasing
 Exit Poll 2019: maharashtra main NDA ko 38 se 42 sitenvahin, bijepi nit endie kaa vot share kerala main badha he

 However, on the basis of 2016 assembly elections, the NDA was expected to get 11% of the vote share in Kerala
 EXIT POLL RESULT: rajasthan phir bolaa bam-bam modi, congress puri tarah saaf!haalanki agsit pole main anya ke vot share main baari kami aane kaa zikr he
 The vote share of other parties in Kerala was 16 per cent in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, but this time its voter is likely to come down to 3 per cent
 to vahiin 2016 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke aadhaar par baat karen to anya dalon ko kerala main is baar 11 phisadi vot share milane kii aashaa thi
