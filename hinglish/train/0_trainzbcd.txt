 " Well aware of the fact that this will test his image as a leader who leads businesses, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath held the first investor meeting of his ten-month-old government in Indore on 18 October
 udghaatan ke maukey par kamalnath ne udyog kshetra ke pramukhon or pratinidhiyon ko apane sambodhan main kaha, ''main chahta tha ki yah baithak aparamparaagat tareeke kii ho

 mahatvapurn baat yah bhi he ki kamalnath ne yah spasht kar diya he ki agar koi bhi masalaa na sulajh rahaa ho to vyavsaayiyon ke liye unke daravaaje hameshaa khule hai
 The Government of Madhya Pradesh also took full advantage of a report related to employment that was revealed at the time of the meeting

 But will the Kamal Nath government overcome the inherited issues like bureaucratic apathy towards businessmen? Apart from this, sluggishness in the economy and difficulties in obtaining loans can also be a big challenge
 vipaksh bhi koi khaas prabhavit najar nahin aata
 BJP state president Rakesh Singh says, Madhya Pradesh is fantastic because of the 'hard work' done by the BJP government in the last 15 years
 kamalnath kehete hai, ''mere saamne is baat kaa khaakaa he ki ab se paanch saal baad madhya pradesh kaisaa najar aayega or main vahaan se ulataa kaam kar rahaa hum

 lekin sach ye he ki yah baat juthi he, unhone kabhi bhi indira ko durga nahin kaha
 He himself confirmed this in a TV interview
 tivi intervyuu main jab unase poocha gaya ki kya aapane indira gandhi ko durga kaha tha to jawaab main unhone kaha, 'maine durga nahin kaha, ye bhi akhbaar waalon ne chhap diya or maine khandan karata rah gaya ki maine nahin kaha, maine nahin kaha

 Associate professor at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, Jonas Tew Triebk, said, "there are significant differences between the effects of exercise done in the morning and in the evening and these differences are probably controlled by the body's circadian clock
" "treebak ne kaha, "subah kii gai kasarat mansapeshiyon kii koshikaon main jin program shuru karti he, jisase ve adhik prabhavi or chini va vasa ke metabolism main sakasham hote hai
 Evening exercise, on the other hand, increases the energy expenditure of the entire body for extended periods of time

 saste hawaii tikaton ke tamaam ophers ke baad ab kuch hi maheene main phir se hawaii kiraye badhane ke asaar hai
 With the increase in the number of passengers during the summer holidays, airlines in the country are also trying to make profits by increasing fares
 agar aap garmi kii chhuttiyon main hawaii safar kaa man bana rahe hai to jald se jald tikat book kara lijie kyonki chhuttiyon ke chalate hawaii kiraye ausatan 40 fisadi tak bad sakate hai
 Not only this, the bad news is that the rents can increase up to double on sectors with high demand
 misaal ke taur par- dilli se mumbai kaa hawaii tikat jo amuman 3 se 5 hajaar rupee tak mil jaataa he may ke maheene main usee ke liye aapako 5 se 10 hajaar rupee chukaane pad sakate hai
 - For tickets from Delhi to Goa, which are usually available for 4 to 6 thousand rupees, you may have to loose 5 to 10 thousand rupees in the month of May
 - dilli se kolkata kaa hawaii tikat jisaki saamaanya keemat 4 se 6 hajaar rupee he uske liye may ke maheene main 10 hajaar rupee tak chukaane pad sakate hai
 It is clear that all airlines are seeing this season of high demand for air tickets as a great opportunity to earn profits
 garmi kii chhuttiyon main agar aap saste tikat paanaa chaahate hai to niraash hone kii koi jarurat nahin
 Experts believe that if the date of travel is fixed, by booking early, you can buy cheap air tickets even amid the demand for more tickets
 lekin is sijan ke saste tikat bhi un tikaton jitne saste nahin honge jitne kuch airlines ne is saal kii shuruyaat ke ophers main die the
 As the demand increases, the increase in air fares is not new

 "the history of colored cotton is as old as white cotton," says Mandloi
 chunki safed kapaas kapade ko manachaaha rang or chapai dene ke liye upyukt hoti he isliye isaki maang zyada thi
 This was the reason that colored cotton went out of circulation
 ''rangeen kapaas kheton tak isliye nahin pahunch saki kyonki pradesh ke krishi mantralay ke adhikari yah niti hi tay nahin kar paae ki aas-paas boe jane par rangeen kapaas ke sankraman se safed kapaas ko kaise bachaaya jaae taaki uskaa rang prabhavit na ho

 narendra modi kaa dhyaan july ke aakhir main internet trol (uksaau saamagree) kii ore gaya
 During an interview, the Chief Minister of Gujarat realized that in the matter of digital world, he had more information than many leaders of his generation
 (misaal dekhie: ''jab maine whatsap jaise aplicoshan ko dekha to paaya ki iskaa istemaal kitna aasaan he
 ") But when it came to internet trolls, Modi seemed unaware of it
 (''abhi aapane koun-sa shabd istemaal kiya? are
 
 haa troling”)
 Nevertheless, he openly opposed such practice
 unhone kaha, ''yah durbhagyapurna he ki kuch swaarthee tatv soshal media kii takat kaa durupyog kar rahe hai
 Recently i came across an incident when a picture was released by digitally manipulating it in a malicious and vulgar manner
 farji cites or sandigdh accounts se parosi ja rahi is tarah kii aapattijanak saamagree ke khilaaf hamen sajag rahanaa hoga
 "of course, critics of Narendra Modi can say that it is the Modi army, which is misusing social media
 iskaa sandarbh shaayad nobel vijeta amartya sen kaa vah maamla hoga, jisamen sen ne kah diya tha ki ve modi ko desh kaa pradhanmantri banate nahin dekhnaa chaahate, or uske baad kaise soshal media main un par hamale kaa daur shuru ho gaya tha
 Modi's monkey army slapped Sen on Twitter
 kuch ne kisi nangi mahila kii tasviir par sen kii beti kaa cheharaa chipka kar post kar diya
 There was strong opposition to the attack on Sen and his family through the Internet
 modi ke intervyuu kaa makasad shaayad apane in kathith samarthakon kii ore se uchhaali ja rahi gandagi ke chhinton se apane daaman ko bachaana hi tha
 Many will argue that Modi's statement is nothing more than an exercise to make up for the loss
 lekin meraa maananaa he ki modi kaa vahi matlab he, jo unhone kaha
 The vicious leader within Modi has realized that the reverse result of the attacks on social media is now coming
 yah bhi ki unki ore se abhiyaan chalaane vaale log ab phaayde se zyada nuksaan kar rahe hai
 To understand Modi's internet army, we have to assume that there are three stages
 pehle daur main bijepi samarthak tamaam vajahon se internet kii ore mukhaatib hue
 They were far more passionate and technical savvy than Congressmen
 unamem se kai sampann enarai the, jinaki computer or internet tak kahin zyada pahunch thi
 In this period, the Sangh Parivar became a vain king of the Internet and its trolls
 chhipakar hamale kii suvidha dene vaale is madhyam par uski internet sena khud se alag raay rakhane waalon ke khilaaf ekadam pil padati
 In the second round, the BJP organized its activities on the Internet a bit
 yah koi chhipi baat nahin ki iske liye puure desh main control room banaae gaye hai or modi kaa to apana khaas internet mahakama hi he, jo samarthakon ko nirdesh detaa rahata he ki kya twit karnaa he, kise nishaanaa bananaa he
 This strategy has been a huge success so far
 soshal media par morcha thame modi ke ye sipaahi is baat ke liye apni peeth thapthapa sakate hai ki unka netaa bijepi ke shikhar tak pahunch gaya or pradhanmantri pad ke liye party kii pasand ban gaya he
 But now we are in the third stage
 modi bijepi ke bheetar kii ladaai to jeet chuke hai
 Now they have to reach the voters wider
 ab unhen khud ko nafrat failaane vaale or hamalavar giroh ke mukhiya kii jagah, aage badhkar netritv dene vaale netaa ke rup main pesh karnaa hoga
 The Congress has finally jumped into the fray with its control room, fake accounts and cheap tricks
 tabhi to internet par sangh parivaar kaa ekadhikaar teji se khatm hota ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, Modi will have to try on the real ground for the electoral battle keeping the Internet trolls aside
 sangh parivaar kii bhi ranneeti badali he
 Now he prefers to attack the Congress instead of following Modi's evil doers
 use samaj main aa gaya he ki amartya sen ke parivaar par keechad oochhaalane se use kuch hasil hone vaala nahin
 On the contrary, voters can move
 par yah sab itnaa aasaan nahin
 Many trolling elements have started to enjoy abusive language
 aise main control room ke manaa kar dene par bhi ye utsaahi vaise hi garajte-barasate rahenge
 i think this is the face of Modi
 isi kaaran unhone trol kii aalochana karte hue soshal media ke durupyog ke prati aagaah kiya
 But the question arises, is it not too late in Modi's plea for restraint? Even after the gang of murderers have been disbanded, there is a possibility that those whom you have left with, become holiday hunters because their Mouth is covered in blood

 unhone kaha, 'piem modi ne lahore main hamen kuch ghante die
 Now the time has come for us to end our quarrels
 ' unhone yah bhi kaha ki tamaam bimariyon kaa ilaaj sadbhaavna se ho jaataa he
 Significantly, on 25 December, PM Modi returned from Afghanistan without any predetermined schedule and went to Nawaz Sharif's house in Lahore for a few hours
 modi ne vahaan navaj kii nathin kii shaadi ke liye badhai di thi or kai tohfe bhi dekar aae the
 Sharif thanked PM Modi for this move and said, "it has been decided that we will resume the process of dialogue between India and Pakistan

 Just three days earlier, on Saturday, 20 fighters were killed in the eastern part of Damascus

 In a separate incident, Jaish al-fatah group of various militant groups in Idlib hanged eight people on charges of spying for the security forces of the Syrian government, according to reports of eight people hanged

 (input language) prakhyat sangeetkaar mohammad jahur khayyam hashmi yani ki khayyam hindi cinema ko kabhi na bhulaae jane vaale sangeet kaa tohfa dekar duniya se rukhsat ho gaye
 His music is relaxing, pulsating and a supernatural feeling of peace
 yah vah sangeet he jo aapke sirahaane baithkar aapako madhurata kii thapakiyaan dekar dur kahin aisi jagah le jaataa he jahaan tanaav lupt ho jaataa he
 Music that expresses its different meanings with gaps of silence, gives different tastes
 khayyam film abhinayta bananaa chaahate the acha hua baad main unhone yah iraadaa chhod diya anyathaa bhartiya cinema jagat or sangeet premi unki bejod rachanaaon se maharoom rahete
 Amongst the number of musicians in Hindi cinema, Khayyam looked the most different
 unki sangeet rachana style kaa unke baad ke jayadev jaise kuch sangeetkaaron ne anusaran jarur kiya lekin khayyam to khayyam hi the
 There is no similarity in their compositions, all are in different colors
 'phir subah hogi' kaa geet 'wo subah kabhi to aegi
 
 
 Listen to 'trishul' and then 'gapuchi Gapuchi Gum Gum Kishiki Kishiki kam kam kam kam
 
 
 ' bhi sun len
 Between these two types of music composition, the tone of Khayyam's music composition world can be felt
 khayyam ne sangeet rachanaaon main bich-bich main ek khaas kism ke kshanik antaraal kaa prayog kiya
 From the song 'you Yun Fasals' from the film 'shankar Hussain'
 
 
 ' ke alaava 'razia sultan' ke 'e dile nadaan
 
 
 The stagnation that is in between 'is going to produce an amazing effect
 sur thamate hai or phir kshanik neeravtaa ke baad phir bahane lagate hai
 In the song of Razia Sultan, in the midst of this stagnation, the noise of the tabla breaks and then the flow of notes starts
 is tarah ke prayog khayyam kii us kalpanashiltaa kii dein hai jo unke sangeet ko alag dhang se paribhaashit karti he
 Very few composers did the same experiment as they used new artists with experiments in musical compositions
 iske peeche unki duubakar kaam karne kii pravriti thi
 Seeing the story of the film, everything from the character to the situation, it becomes clear why Khayyam's music is different
 film 'razia sultan' main geet tha 'haa ye zanjeer kii jhankaar, khuda khayr kare
 
 
 'kabban Mirza was the artist to sing it
 cubbon mirza yani marsia or nohe gane vaale or saath main lakhanu main akashwani ke 'hawamahal' or 'chhayagit' jaise kaaryakramon ke prastota
 In the film, Dharmendra in the role of Habshi, the situation for the song, his tune and then most importantly the singing of Kabban Mirza, all of them will look amazing
 ve cinema ke liye aisa mukammal sangeet taiyaar karte the jisamen kahin koi asangatta dhundne kii koi gunjaaish nahin hoti thi
 The film 'pavement' came out in 1953
 is film ke liye talat mohammad ne geet gaaya 'shaame gam kii kasam aaj gamgin hai ham
 
 
 'guitar was new in the music of this film at that time
 san 1961 kii film 'sholaa or shabnam' main rafee ne gaaya 'jane kya dhundti rahati hai ye ankhe mujhamen, raakh ke dher main sholaa he na chingaari he
 
 
 'this was the film whose music became such a hit that even today it is being heard and heard
 isi sangeet ne khayyam ko ek sangeetkaar ke rup main cinema jagat main sthapit kiya
 In the 1967 film Aakhri Khat, the song 'baharo Mera Jeevan Bhiaro', composed by Lata Mangeshkar's notes
 
 Listen, the test of the song is completely different
 san 1977 main ai kamaal amrohi kii film 'shankar hossain' flop ho gai lekin iskaa sangeet kaaljayi ban gaya
 Lata Mangeshkar sang for the film 'apne Raat Raaton, chillamanen sarki
 
 
 ' , 'aap yun faasalon se guzarate rahe
 
 
 And the song sung by Mohammad Rafi 'somewhere a delicate girl, very beautiful, but beautiful
 
 
 ' hindi cinema ke sangeet kii madhurata kii misaal hai
 This music is unmatched which will always dissolve in the minds of the listeners
 khayyam kabhi samjhauta nahin karte the, chaahe vah film kii kahani ho yaa uske geet hon, ve sirf vahi kaam karte the jo unke man ko bhaataa tha
 When the story of the film sounds right, then the situation of the songs in it and then the composition of the words according to the need
 
 
 yah sab hone par hi ve sangeet dene ke liye hami bharte the
 He worked on his own terms and always proved himself better
 ve geet or shaayari ke gahare jaankaar the
 He did not just use his fun to earn money, but more than that, he composed music for self-satisfaction so that not only he would be relieved but the listener also felt relaxed
 'dekh lo aaj hamako ji bhar ke
 
 koi aata nahin he, phir mar ke
 
 
 This song from the film 'bazaar' was sung by Jagjit Kaur
 vahi jagajeet cor jinhone film 'shagun' kaa geet - 'tum apana ranjo gam, apni pareshaani mujhe de do
 
 
 'sang
 unhone 'umrao jaan' kaa gaanaa 'kaahe ko byaahe bidesh, are lakhiya babul more
 
 
 'sang also
 jagajeet cor yani sangeetkaar khayyam kii jivan sangini
 Music brought him and Khayyam to each other
 jahaan khayyam kaa sangeet anya sangeetkaaron se juda he vahiin jagajeet cor ke sur bhi alag rang liye hue hai
 Khayyam and Jagjit Kaur partnered throughout the life and then shared a legacy of around Rs 10 crore, like their melodious music
 jab khayyam 90 saal ke hue the to unhone or jagajeet cor ne apni samoochee sampatti ke liye ek trust banaaya
 This trust was created to help artists who are in trouble for whatever reason
 khayyam sahab '
 
 
 
 koi aata nahin he phir marake', lekin aap jaaenge kahaan
 
 
 The people who listen to you will keep listening to your music forever

 purvi dilli ke jitibi aspataal main dillivaasiyon ko ilaaj main praathamikta dene ke maamle main shuukravaar ko court kaa faisla aa saktaa he
 The bench of High Court Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice VK Rao is likely to pronounce judgment on the petition filed against the Delhi government circular on Friday
 is maamle main abhi tak hui do sunwaayee ke dauraan donon pakshon ne apni daleelein pesh kii or court ne faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 Ashok Aggarwal, the petitioner in this case, challenged the circular of the Health Department of the Delhi government, which prohibited the treatment of outpatients at GTB Hospital, in the High Court, saying that the government's order violated the constitutional right of the common people
 yachika main court se kaha gaya tha ki 70 fisadi garib marij hi ilaaj ke liye sarkari aspataal main jate hai
 Therefore, the Delhi government should withdraw its decision
 ashok agarwal ne court se ye bhi kaha tha ki agar sarkari aspataal garibon ko ilaaj nahin denge to ve kahaan jaaenge
 He said that under Article 21 of the Constitution i
e
 the right to live, every person has the right to travel and enjoy facilities in any state of the country
 iske alaava anuchhed 14 yani samaan adhikaar ke tahat bhi is tarah kaa sarkaar kaa circular asanvaidhanik he
 Whereas, Delhi Government Standing Counselor Rahul Mehra defended the government saying that the number of patients outside Delhi is more in the government hospital and doctors are often beaten about it
 hamen centre sarkaar bhi paryaapt aarthik madad nahin de rahi he
 Therefore, it is not possible to give free treatment to all patients
 rahul mehara ne court se ye bhi kaha tha ki yah sarkaar kii niti he or court isamen hastkshep nahin kar sakati he
 Now it has to be seen whether the order coming from the High Court goes in favor of the government or the court cancels this circular

 99 cr] madhya pradesh kaa mandsaur or uske aasapaas ke jile in dinon kisaanon ke andolan kii aag main jal rahe hai
 The Narendra Modi government at the center has been raising the issue of farmers vigorously since the beginning
 piem modi ne to agle 5 saal main yani varsh 2022 tak kisaanon kii aamadani doguni karne kaa elaan kiya
 For this, he has also launched several schemes
 haalanki jameen par kisaanon kii naaraazgi dekhte hue aisa lagata he ki ye yojanaayen museebaton main ghire kisaanon ko raahat pahunchane main naakaafi sabit hue
 So let's first look at the steps taken by the Modi government for the farmers
 modi sarkaar ne khetihar jameen kii paidaavaar badhaane par jor dete hue swil health card yojana shuru kii
 In this, different fertilizers and seeds are given for every field according to the soil
 II
 The government is now giving neem-coated urea to be used to increase the yield of the fields
 isse uria kii kalabazari par laagam laga he or kisaanon ko aasaani se uria mil ja rahaa he
 III
 modi sarkaar ne iske saath hi 'par drop mor crop' ke makasad se sinchai vyavastha ko majboot karne ke liye bade bajet kaa praavdhaan kiya he
 IV
 iske saath hi acchhee fasal hone par nuksaan kii rokthaam ke liye cold storage or ware houseing main baari nivesh kiya
 V
 vahiin kheti ke alaava murgi paalan, madhumakhi paalan, machhlee paalan vagairah ko bhi badhaava dene par bhi kaam kiya
 However, despite these plans, the plight of farmers remains the same
 isse kisaanon main naaraazgi badi or upi main kisaanon ke karj maaf hone ke baad madhya pradesh, maharashtra or tamilnadu ke bhi kisaan apane karj maaf karne kii maang karne lage
 When Madhya Pradesh had a bumper crop of onions, the prices reached the ground
 isse kisaan karj maafee or fasal ke liye nunatam samarthan mulya badhaane kii maang ko lekar andolan karne lage
 During this period, five farmers were killed in police firing on the protesters
 iske baad dekhte hi dekhte rajya ke 7 jilon main hinsa fail gai
 Political mercury has also been hot on this matter
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi bhi kisaanon se milane mandsaur aa rahe the, lekin police ne unhen raste main hi roak liya
 During this, he targeted PM Modi and said that the Modi government simply shoots the farmers
 yahaan kisaanon main piem modi kii khamoshi ko lekar bhi gussa he
 Since Tuesday, PM Modi has congratulated BIMSTEC countries on Twitter, congratulated Sher Bahadur Deuba on becoming the Prime Minister of Nepal, counted the benefits of yoga, and expressed sorrow over the plane crash in Myanmar
 lekin kisaanon kii samvednaaon par maraham lagane ke liye ek twit nahin kiya
 The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which is visiting Mandasour to meet the farmers, has targeted this silence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 AAP netaa sanjay singh ne kaha, 'europe, afghanistan yaa pakistan main agar koi choti si ghatana bhi hoti he, to duniya main is par twit karne vaale pehle shaks hamaare pradhanmantri narendra modi hote hai
 He speaks on these first, but he did not utter a word on the death of the farmers
 ' The Law Minister said, 'as far as basic facilities are concerned, it is a continuous process
 vahiin niyuktiyon kaa jo maamla he, to supreme court kaa hi nirnay he ki prakriya ke prativedan ko adhik paardarshee, uddeshyparak, tarksangat, nishpaksh banaaya jaae or sarkaar kaa drushtikon pichley teen maheene se bhi adhik samay se lambit he or hamen abhi bhi supreme court kaa jawaab milanaa shesh he
 ' pradhan nyaayadhish ne kaha, 'nyaayaadhikrnon kii sthiti mujhe abhas dilaati he ki aap (nyaayaadhikaran) bhi behatar nahin hai
 You are also struggling with the problem of shortage of manpower
 aap nyaayaadhikaran kii sthapana nahin kar sakate, aap kai sthanon par isaki peeth gathit nahin kar sakate, kyonki aapke paas sadsy hi nahin hai
 ' nyaayamurti thakur ne kaha, 'yadi is nyaayaadhikaran kii kshamta 65 he or yadi aapke yahaan 18 yaa 20 riktiyaan hai, to iskaa matlab yah hua ki aapke paas kaaphi sankhya main kami he
 Work has to be affected by this and due to this you have five and seven year old cases here too
 kam se kaam aap (sarkaar) yah to sunishchit kiijie ki ye nyaayaadhikaran puri kshamta se kaam karen
 ' pradhan nyaayadhish ne yah bhi kaha ki nyaayaadhikaran puri tarah susajjit nahin he or ve khaali pade hai or aaj sthiti yah ho gayi he ki supreme court kaa koi bhi sevanivrutt nyaayadhish nyaayaadhikaran kii adhyakshata nahin karnaa chahta
 i have trouble sending my retired colleagues there
 ' unhone kaha, 'sarkaar uchit suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karaane ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 Apart from vacancies, lack of basic facilities in tribunals is also a matter of concern
 ' Justice Thakur said, "there is a need to amend the rules relating to appointment of Chairperson and Members in various tribunals so that judges of High Courts can also be eligible for these posts
" ' In the ceremony, the Law Minister said that the Central Administrative Tribunal has a wonderful experience among the tribunals because of its successful collection of judicial and administrative excellence
 unhone kaha ki is nyaayadhiran ne seva maamalon or niyamon ko taiyaar karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai he
 The comments kendriya kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne haalanki unki shikayaton se asahmati jataate hue kaha, 'ham aadar ke saath unase (chif justise se) sahamat nahin hai
 We have made 120 appointments this year
 1990 ke baad se keval 80 niyuktiyaan kii gai hai
 5000 posts are vacant in lower courts, in which central government has no role
 is par to nyaaypalika ko hi kadam uthaane hai
 As far as infrastructure and facilities are concerned, it is an ongoing process
 ' Justice TS Thakur has raised the issue of shortage of judges in the courts many times before
 isi saal april main ek kaarykram ke dauraan vah pradhanmantri narendra modi kii maujudi main jajon kii kami kaa mudda uthaate hue bhavuk ho gaye the
 The Chief Justice said, 'the status of the tribunals gives me the impression that you (tribunal) are also not better
 aap bhi maanavshakti kii kami kii samasya se jujh rahe hai
 You cannot set up a tribunal, you cannot set up its bench in many places, because you do not have members
 ' Justice Thakur said, 'if the capacity of this tribunal is 65 and if you have 18 or 20 vacancies, then it means that you have a lot of shortage
 isse kaary prabhavit hona hi he or isi vajah se aapke yahaan paanch or saat saal puraane maamle bhi hai
 At least, you (the government) make sure that these tribunals work to their full potential
 ' The Chief Justice also said that the Tribunal is not fully equipped and they are lying vacant and today the situation has become such that no retired judge of the Supreme Court wants to preside over the Tribunal
 mujhe apane sevanivrutt sahyogiyon ko vahaan bhejne main ksht hota he
 'he said,' The government is not ready to provide proper facilities
 rictiyon ke alaava nyaayaadhikrnon main buniyadi suvidhaon kaa abhaav bhi chintaa kaa vishay he
 ' nyaayamurti thakur ne kaha, 'vibhinn nyaayaadhikrnon main adhyaksh or sadasyon kii niyukti sambandhi niyamon main sanshodhan kii aavashyaktaa he taaki ucch nyaayalayon ke nyaayadhish bhi in padon ke yogya ho saken
 ' samaaroh main kanoon mantri ne kaha ki kendriya prashasnic nyaayaadhikaran kaa nyaayik or prashasnic utkrishthata ke safal kalevar kii vajah se nyaayaadhikrnon ke bich bhi adbhut anubhav he
 He said that this tribunal played an important role in framing service matters and rules
 tippaniyan Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, however, disagreed with their complaints, saying, 'we do not agree with him (the Chief Justice) with respect

 Please think twice before you decide to comment something rude or offensive, it's not a joke
 It's sad how in this day and age where feminism is finally getting the attention it deserves, girls still feel the need to tear each other down and indulge in body shaming
 i don't care if you think my stomach pops out or if i don't fit into your idea of beautiful, but for your own conscience please realize that having such narrow minded opinions of people makes you an ugly person inside
 i truly believe everyone is beautiful in their own way, why can't we all celebrate that and encourage each other
 There is only one of you, embrace your beauty, and don't rain on my parade when I'm confident enough to embrace mine

 Some photos of which he shared on Instagram
 in tasveeron par kuch negative or bhadde caments aae the
 In response to which Khushi wrote a long post on Instagram, she wrote in the post, 'I post my pictures because i am full of confidence and i like to do so
 ' i post my pictures because i feel good and confident
 i put out these pictures not because i want to show off or try to be anyone or anything else
 i have my own sense of style and my own way to think and me putting out a picture that's accessible to so many people is taken more of an opportunity to judge me or my looks, clothes or anything else
 i put something out there because it's something i feel good about, everyone is entitled to have their own opinion but putting someone else down because of it is not making you any better of a person
 Please think twice before you decide to comment something rude or offensive, it's not a joke
 It's sad how in this day and age where feminism is finally getting the attention it deserves, girls still feel the need to tear each other down and indulge in body shaming
 i don't care if you think my stomach pops out or if i don't fit into your idea of beautiful, but for your own conscience please realize that having such narrow minded opinions of people makes you an ugly person inside
 i truly believe everyone is beautiful in their own way, why can't we all celebrate that and encourage each other
 There is only one of you, embrace your beauty, and don't rain on my parade when I'm confident enough to embrace mine
 i hope that whatever it is that frustrates you enough to be so cruel will one day go away, because some people might actually take your snide remarks seriously, and i know from experience it can hurt
