tippaniyan All the four stories in the film are different from each other, which seems to be made for multiplex audiences
 chaaron kahaniyaan experimental hai, jo aam aadmi kii samaj se dur hai
 All directors have experimented fiercely
 ho saktaa he ki alag-alag logon ko in main se alag-alag kahaniyaan pasand aaen
 There may be laughter at some places in the film, but the film lacks entertainment value
 'bombai tokies' jab se ban rahi thi, tabhi se ise bollywood ke 100 saal kaa tribut bataakar pramot kiya jaataa rahaa, lekin asal tribut sirf ek gane main he, jo film ke khatm hone ke baad aata he
 The song is based on Bollywood and many stars have shown their glimpses in this song
 filmkaaron kii shaayad asal koshish yah bataane ki he ki bollywood ke 100 saal puraa hone tak ham itane badal gaye hai or itane experimental ho gaye hai ki hamaara experiment aam darshakon kii samaj se dur he, isliye 'bombai tokies' ke liye meri reating he 2

 film kii chaaron kahaniyaan ek-duusare se alag hai, jise dekhakar lagata he ki yah multiplex audience ke liye banaai gai hai
 All four stories are experimental, far from the common man's understanding
 sabhi nirdeshkon ne jamkar experiment kiye hai
 It may be that different people like different stories from these
 film main kuch jagahon par hansi aa sakati he, magar film main antertenment vailu kii behad kami he
 Ever since 'bombay Talkies' was being produced, it has been promoted as a 100-year-old Bollywood tribute, but the actual tribute is in only one song, which comes after the film ends
 yah gaanaa bollywood par aadhaarit he or is gane main kai sitaron ne apni jhalak dikhaai he
 Perhaps the real effort of the filmmakers is to tell that by the time 100 years of Bollywood is over, we have changed so much and become so experimental that our experiment is far beyond the comprehension of the general audience, hence my rating for 'bombay Talkies' is 2 
 5 star

 parveen0106 # behappy # onset # loveher # ghulaam # Shivani # gulgulia post shared by Niti Taylor (@nititaylor) on May 13, 2017 at 9:36am PDT The draft report of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), which is probing irregularities in the allocation of two-g spectrum, has blamed the Prime Minister's office with the former Telecom Minister a Raja being fully convicted
 isamen ‘doshanivarak kadam’ nahin uthaane ke liye cabinet sachivalay or kuch ‘durbhagyapurna bhuulon’ ke aarope main pradhanmantri ko bhi nahin bakhsha gaya he
 It is understood that the draft report sent by PAC President Murali Manohar Joshi to the members has strongly criticized the then Finance Minister p Chidambaram for advising him to take action against those who were causing revenue loss
 He told the Prime Minister that "the case should be considered as concluded"
 ’’ aisi sambhaavna he ki samiti main shaamil samprag ke sadasyon kii ore se is report ke prati virodh jataayaa jayega
 In this detailed report related to the 2G spectrum case, it is understood that some unpleasant words have been used about the Prime Minister
 isamen kaha gaya he ki pradhanmantri karyaalay ne apane ko tu ji maamle se itnaa adhik dur rakhaa ki e raja ko apane ‘anuchit or manamaane’ kaaryon ko anjaam dene main madad mili
 According to the report, the Prime Minister wanted to keep the PMO away from it on January 3, 2008, which made it seem as if Raja had indirectly given the green signal to go ahead in the matter and carry out his wrong and arbitrary actions
 raja kii ore se license or spectrum ke vivaadaaspad vitaran vishay ko cabinet ke samaksh 10 janvari 2008 ko laayaa gaya
 The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has stated in its report that 1 from this controversial decision
 76 lakh karod rupaye kaa rajasav nuksaan hua
 The report, appearing for consideration before the committee, stated that the Prime Minister's Office had either failed to make predictions or merely remained a mute spectator
 isamen kaha gaya he ki samiti yah jaanakar udign he ki doorsanchaar mantralay ke ghatnakram ke bare main pradhanmantri ne november 2007 ko likhe patr main jo salaah evam chintaa jaahir kii, raja ne uski puri tarah andekhi kii
 According to the report, Raja misled the Prime Minister by saying that the issue of auction of spectrum was considered, but the Telecom Commission and TRAI did not recommend it
 isamen kaha gaya, ‘‘mantri aadha sach bol rahe the or duusare hisse tathaa apane gupt uddeshyon ko chipa rahe the
 Criticizing the Prime Minister's Office, the report said that the committee was not satisfied with the pmo's argument that no suggestion for the formation of a high-powered committee of ministers was received by the Law Minister
 report ke anusaar, ‘‘piemo ko vidhi mantri ke suzav kii jaankaree thi lekin kinhin anjaan kaarnon se doorsanchaar mantri ke vipareet vichaaron ko vidhi mantri ke vichaaron par tarjeeh di gai or piemo kii ore se mantriyon ke ucchadhikaar samiti ke gathan kaa prayaas nahin kiya gaya
 "it says," The Prime Minister's Office certainly failed to anticipate it or remained merely a mute spectator
 ’’baharhaal, report main tatkaaleen videsh mantri pranav mukherjee ke liye prashansa ke shabd kahe gaye hai
 It said that Mukherjee, in a note to the Prime Minister, underlined the responsibility of the government, suggested changes in policy, amendment and the implementation of its work in a transparent manner
 mukherjee ne apni tippanee main spasht taur par kaha ki naye license jari karne ke dauraan license pradaan karne ke maapdandon ko majboot banane ke saath ise yathashighra saarvajanik kiya ja saktaa he
 The report says that it is clear that he did not give any wrong advice to the king, whose facts later the king distorted and wrote to the Prime Minister
 isamen kaha gaya ki raja ne vidhi mantri ke spectrum se jude maamle ko mantriyon kii ucchadhikaar samiti ko bhejne ke suzav ko uddandtapurvak ‘vishay se itar’ bataaya
 Not only this, he informed the Prime Minister that due to scarcity of spectrum, the last date has been fixed as 25 September 2007, whereas earlier he had said that there is a lot of scope to allocate spectrum to some new operators
 masauda report main kaha gaya he ki, ‘‘ unka (raja) pradhanmantri ko yah aashwaasan ki vah sthapit or vartmaan prakriya se nahin bhatak rahe hai
 This was completely untrue as they spoiled the 'first come, first serve' policy
 ’’chidambaram par tippanee karte hue report main kaha gaya he, ‘‘samiti yah jaanakar hairaan or stabdh rah gai ki tatkaaleen vitt mantri ne 15 farvari 2008 main apane note main sweekaar kiya ki spectrum durlabh sansaadhan he
 
 
 The price of spectrum should be decided on the basis of its rarity and utility
 lekin iske saath unhone is maamle ko band maane jane kii adbhut salaah bhi de di
 "according to the report," the committee believes that accountability is the responsibility of the government to compensate for the wrongly inflicted harm and the culprits should be brought to justice

 The committee found that the Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) failed to bring the subject to the notice of the Cabinet Secretary and even he did not write anything to the Finance Minister after the irregularities were made public on the subject, While there was widespread discussion on huge loss of revenue

 When India's politics was undergoing a major transformation in November last year, the Communist Party of China in Beijing was engaged in a third plenum with President Xi Jinping to refresh the economy
 china ke sudhaar purodha deng jiyaoping ne aarthik sudhaaron ko china kii (maao kii kranti ke baad) duusari kranti bhale hi kaha ho lekin deng se jinping tak aate-aate 35 saal main chini netritv ko yah ehsaas ho gaya ki zyada ghisne se sudhaaron kaa mulammaa bhi chhot jaataa he
 Therefore, the new agenda of reforms which emerged from the Communist Party's grand meeting was not focused on the global threat of "made in China" but on the internal progress of the country
 duniya achraj main thi ki vishwa kii duusari sabase badi arthvyavastha apni desi iconomi main aisa kya karne vaali he jisase 1
 Will the income of 35 billion people continue to increase? Incidentally, before President Jinping reached Delhi, the world has got a rough outline of China's "third Revolution" agenda
 china 2025 tak apane jidipi ko doguna karne vaala he
 The charisma will come from the Internet economy, which will contribute $ 2,200 billion to China's GDP
 yakeenan, computer takneekon ke bade pairokaar pradhanmantri narendra modi apane chini doston se yah jarur jaananaa chahenge ki china inclusive growth ke liye kaisaa digital dizin bana rahaa he
 The world was shocked when China decided to change its growth formula last year
 lekin ab global niveshkon ko china ke viraat digital mansoobey kii jaankaree milane lagi he
 Global consultancy firm mckenzie has presented a blueprint for this change in a recent report
 internet iconomi china ke growth ingine kaa eendhan hogi, jo utpaadakta, innovations or khapat badhaane kii aguai karte hue 2025 tak jidipi kii badhotaree main 22 fisadi tak yogadan karegi
 Share of China's Internet-based economy to GDP by 2010 3 fisadi tha, jo 2013 main 4
 Has grown more than the US, with it reaching 4 per cent
 2013 main 70 karod sakriy smart divises (phone-tablet) ke saath china ab 63 karod internet upabhoktaaon kaa desh he
 Where e-commerce marketplaces such as Taobao and Teammol now have deals worth $ 6 billion per day
 sudhaaron ke pichley daur main china ne apni vishaal shram shakti ke jariye global bazaaron ko ‘‘maid in china’’ utpaadon se paat diya tha lekin kamjor utpaadakta, ausat quality or nae prayogon kii kami ne china ko saste maal kii factory main badal diya
 Now Internet will be a means of increasing productivity and innovation
 chini companiyaan agle saal tak apni kamai kaa chaar fisadi hissaa digital takneekon par kharch karengi
 Experts are estimating that new Internet applications will increase China's labor productivity by 22 percent over the next decade
 forrester or iresearch ke mutabik, chini logon ne i-commers par 296 arab dollar kharch kar pichley saal hi apane mulk ko america se bada i-commers bazaar bana diya tha, is saal mobile commers main bhi china america se aage hoga
 The Internet economy, based on low cost, surplus production and large distribution system, is giving the power of domestic consumption to China's economy
 agle kuch varshon main china ke micro multimanationals global charchaa kaa vishay honge
 Small and medium-sized industries contribute 70 per cent to China's GDP and are the biggest source of employment and innovation in this large economy
 china ke menuphaccharing samrajya kii sabase choti ikaayiyon main digital takanic kaa istemaal badhanaa china ke nae sudhaaron kaa bada focus hone vaala he taaki alibaba jaise i-commers plateform ke jariye inhen niryaat bazaar or global bazaaron se jodakar micro multinational banaaya ja sake
 This massive project of digital growth will initially eliminate many traditional jobs, but the Chinese government has accounted for the loss of employment and the creation of new opportunities
 maikenji kii report ke mutabik, internet iconomi 2025 tak kareeb 3
 1 crore will eliminate employment but 4
 6 karod nae rojgaar taiyaar bhi karegi
 After the Third Plenum of the Communist Party, Jinping declared the new agenda of reforms, calling the Chinese growth as unbalanced, disgraceful and full of social discrimination
 1992 aane tak deng jiyaoping bhi kah uthe the ki agar china ne apni aabaadi kii jindagi behatar nahin kii to sudhaar andhi gali main gum ho jaaenge
 The benefits of growth have not been shared equally in China, so some islands of prosperity are producing discontent among the vast population
 china ko apni pragati kaa aglaa agenda tay karne ke liye kisi aise formule kii talash thi jiske jariye aarthik growth ke phaaydon ko badi aabaadi main baanta ja sake
 In Internet and digital technologies, China has found a recipe to make its growth inclusive
 2025 main duniya is baat se chamatkrit nahin hogi ki china ne ek dashak main apana rashtriya utpaadan (jidipi) doguna yani lagbhag 20 trillian dollar kar liya, hairat is baat par hogi ki yah karishma digital takneekon ke sahare hua he
 There are many sources for India hidden in this third revolution of China

 He said that there was no scam in the Rafale deal, India has to give us 36 aircraft and will supply it
 agar bharat ko or bhi vimaan chahie to hamen isaki bhi aapurti karne main khushi hogi
 Erik Trappier, CEO of Dassault Company, the company making Rafael, who arrived at the ongoing Aero India-2019 air show in Bangalore, said it was a clean deal
 isliye mujhe kaig report or supreme court ke faisle ko lekar koi baichaini nahin thi
 The first Rafale aircraft will reach India in the month of September
 jiske baad har maheene ek vimaan bharat ko diya jayega
 In this sense, 36 aircraft will be supplied in 36 months
 rafel vimaan ke desh main banane ke sawaal par trepier ne kaha ki bharat main aircraft banane ke liye kam se kam 100 vimaanon kaa order hona chahie
 In response to a question asked by the Supreme Court about the setback to Anil Ambani in the Reliance Infocomm and Ericsson case, Eric Trappier said that this is an internal financial matter of the company
 unki company main hamaara (dasolt) nivesh surakshit he or behatar nigaraanee main he
 In fact, on Wednesday, the Supreme Court held Anil Ambani guilty of contempt of court
 is cese main court ambani ko arikson india ko bakaayaa raashi dene kaa aadesh diya tha
 Let us tell you that there has been an offset agreement between Dassault and Anil Ambani's company under the Rafale deal, about which the opposition has been constantly raising questions
 gauratlab he ki rafel vivaad main congress lagaataar dasolt company ke siio erik trepier ke 26 march 2015 ko tatkaaleen vaayu sena adhyaksh arup rahaa or hindustan aironautics limited (echeel) adhyaksh kii maujuudagi main die bayaan kaa hawala detaa rahaa he, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki dasolt or echeel ke samjhaute apane antim charan main he
 Explain that in the deal that was under negotiation during the UPA government, 18 aircraft were to come directly from France, while 108 aircraft were to be built in partnership with Dassault and HAL
 lekin upie sarkaar ke baad modi sarkaar main hue nae saude main 126 ke badale 36 vimaan kaa sauda hua or is nae qaraar main echeel kii bhoomika nahin rahi
 Apart from this, Dassault company chose Anil Ambani's Reliance Defense as its offset partner
 congress kaa aarope he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne anil ambani ko phayda pahunchane ke liye pichhlaa sauda radd kiya

 Amid allegations of corruption in the Rafale fighter jet deal, Eric Trappier, CEO of aircraft manufacturer Dassault, claimed that while Anil Ambani's selection of Reliance as an offset partner was done by Dassault himself, the history of Reliance also led to this decision There was an important reason for taking
 erik trepier ne bataaya ki kyon bharat sarkaar kii aronutics company echeel kii tulana main dasolt ke liye reliance ek behatar ofaset partner bani
 Trappier said that Anil Ambani's Reliance is part of the Reliance group that was founded by Dhirubhai Ambani
 haalanki us vakt kii reliance ab mukesh ambani or anil ambani ke bich bant chuki he lekin abhi bhi unki maa bataur gargian maujuud hai
 Apart from this, Trappier said that even though Reliance had no experience in making aircraft, companies in the Ambani family have good experience working in the engineering sector and this is a big reason why Dassault chose him as an offset partner 
 rafel par france kii media ne bhi uthaae sawaal- HAL kii jagah ambani ko kaise mili deal?dasolt ke siio ne kaha ki echeel kii jagah reliance ko praathamikta dene main company ne is baat par bhi gaur kiya ki aakhir rafel vimaan ko bharat main kitne samay main banaaya ja saktaa he
 Trappier said that Dassault was attempting to contract with a company that could manufacture Rafale at about the same time as it takes Dassault to make a Rafale aircraft in France
 khaas baat he ki trepier ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki anil ambani ke netritv vaali reliance ne desh hit main aronutics kshetra main bada kadam badhaane kii pahal kii he
 Due to this, Dassault took the initiative to enter into this agreement with a new company, so that the possibility of big work between the two companies will also be ready
 rafel par koun kar rahaa he gumraah? rahul, maikron, nirmala main galat koun?dasolt ke rafel vimaan kii keemat ke sawaal par bhi siio ne kaha ki bharat se puraani deal kii apeksha nai deal karne ke liye company ne rafel vimaan kii keemat main 9 fisadi kii katautee kii he
 Due to this, in the old deal, the company had to supply 18 Rafale fighter aircraft in ready-to-fly situation, while in the new deal it has to supply 36 ready-to-fly aircraft
 iske chalate company ne ladaaku vimaan kii puraani keemat main 9 fisadi kaa discount dene kaa faisla kiya or ab bharat ko prayek ladaaku vimaan 9 fisadi kam keemat par supplai kiye jayega

 Congress is not insisting on making any one person as PM
 congress bas parivartan chaahati he
 On Rahul Gandhi, he said that in the political situation of the country today, there is no position to win elections by projecting someone against anyone

 When he does not speak, he is attacked
 jab vah bolte hai, un par hamalaa kiya jaataa he
 When he does nothing, he is attacked
 jab vah kuch karte hai, un par hamalaa kiya jaataa he
 When a party general secretary urges Rahul to say something on topical issues, he is attacked
 jab vahi mahasachiv khud kuch bol detaa he, un par hamalaa kiya jaataa he
 i think the same thing happens in politics, but if we act wisely and leave aside the prejudices and the ability to debate, then we can say our things in a rational way
 rahul gandhi hamaari party ke netaa nahin hai, upanetaa hai
 Therefore, his mother remains the leader of this party, he will have to walk with the same team that his mother has built around him
 aakhir, vah unki maa hai - so, paribhaasha ke lihaaz se maa or bete ke bich soch main peedigat antar (jenereshan gap) hota hi he, kisi bhi maa or bete ke bich
 i also have to confess this generation gap personally, because i have been his father's colleague, and i am a few years older than his father
 meri or rahul kii aayu main 30 saal kaa fark he, so, kyonkar sambhav he ki ham donon ke bich jenereshan gap na ho
 Will i consider people born in the year 1911 to be my generation - or call them a staggering generation? Wordsworth wrote the song long ago, 'A child is born from a male
 
 
 ' so, yah katai swaabhaavik he ki rahul apni peedi ke logon ke saath katai saamaanya or zyaada sahaj mahasoos karte hai
 This will happen not just to Rahul, but to anyone born in the '70s
 bhale hi ham donon ke bich 30 saal kaa fark he, lekin iske baavjood aisa nahin he ki vah mujhe ajooba samajhate hon, yaa main unhen duusare grah kaa praani samajhataa hum
 On the contrary, there is a pleasant feeling here that the reins are to be handed over in skilled hands
 vah badlaav hoga, lekin nirantarata bani rahani chahie
 This idea should be enough to raise any organization that has a history of 129 years behind it, and will remain at least 129 years ahead
 bhartiya rashtriya congress main jenereshan gap hameshaa se hi swaabhaavik taur par shaamil rahaa he, jiskaa sabase mashhoor udhaaharan rahaa he, motilal nehru or unke putr jawaharlal nehru ke bich kaa matbhed, jo bharat ke swatantry sangharsh ke uddeshy - swytt pradesh athwa purna swaraj - ko lekar hua
 Motilal believed that this would be more practical if the demand was confined to the status of an autonomous state, while his son had a different view
 varsh 1927 kaa adhiktar hissaa jawaharlal ne videsh main bitaayaa, jabaki usee dauraan unke pita simon mishan ke liye congress kaa vaikalpik samvidhan taiyaar kar rahe the - simon mishan british sarkaar kaa sirf angrejon se bana mishan tha, jiskaa kaam bharatiyon ko zyaada swaittata dene ke raaston par vichaar karnaa tha
 So while the Congress as a party was boycotting the Simon mission by showing black flags and shouting 'simon mission, go back', Motilal Nehru would still have prepared an alternative constitution of Congress for Simon mission
 are
 jab jawaharlal europe se laute, or congress ke varsh 1927 main hue madras adhiveshan main bhaag liya, jahaan unke pita party adhyaksh chune gaye, vah (jawaharlal) apane pita dwaara taiyaar kiye gaye draft se behad naaraaz the, jisamen congress kii swatantraaa kii maang ko swytt pradesh tak simit kar diya gaya tha
 He and other colleagues of his generation (especially Subhash Chandra Bose) also openly fought Motilal over the 'nehru Report', which reached the extent that Motilal was forced to urge Gandhi ji (father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi)
 He had to leave the retirement and come out of the Sabarmati Ashram, and mediate between father and son in the Calcutta session of 1928
 gandhi ji maan gaye - lekin unhone shart rakhi ki motilal ke baad congress kaa aglaa adhyaksh vahi tay karenge
 When the time came, Gandhiji made Jawaharlal the president, but he stopped for a full year to demand full Swaraj, to try to convince the British about this demand
 jab british katai nahin maane, tab jaakar jawaharlal nehru ko 'purna swaraj' ko lakshya ghoshit karne tathaa 26 janvari, 1930 ko lahore ke nikat raavi nadi ke tat par swatantraaa dhvaj fahraane kii anumati di gai
 Congress has a similar tradition of resolving differences in a positive way
 aisa hi tab hua tha, jab azaadi ke turant baad gandhivadiyon (rajaji, rajendra prasad aadi sabhi) ne yuva nehruwadiyon ko aage aane diya; isi tarah nehru ke kareebi sahyogiyon - da syndicate - ko indira kii peedi ke liye pad tyaagane pade; phir unke kai sahyogiyon ne rajeev ke saathiyon ko rasta diya
 The same change will happen when Rahul becomes the party president
 khayr, tab tak nae or puraane ek saath hi rahenge, or saath milakar, haalanki alag-alag tareekon se, may, 2014 main mili karaari haar se party ko ubaarane kii disha main kaam karte rahenge
 Undoubtedly, some youths or elders are unavoidably unavoidable, while some elders shy away from announcing the end of their innings
 lekin inamen se kisi kaa bhi arth vidroh athwa tut nahin hota
 It only means that the '70s generation is gradually taking over the command from the' 40s-'50s generation
 parantu rahul ko kuch diggajon kii zarurat to padegi, so, kuch ko duusari pari khilne kaa mauka mil saktaa he
 Everything goes on like this, and ends
 koi sankat nahin he, sirf us party main parivartan kaa daur he, jisane bharatiyon kii chah pidiyon kii seva kii he, or jiske paas aantarik shakti bhi he, or paryaapt lacheelaapan bhi he, taaki shashan karne ke liye swaabhaavik party ke rup main anischitkaal tak astitv banaae rakhane kii khatir kuch jatke bardaasht kar sake
 The present year is nothing but hallucinations like 1977 and 1989
 ham waapas aaenge, kuch puraane or bahut saare nae chehron ke saath

 In Sub Sahara and Arab countries and poor countries, only 20 to 25 percent of the target could be met
 is tarah se anya desh amir deshon kii tulana menshikshake maamle main kaaphi peeche he
 Not only this, the targets set in the funding of education could also not be met
 saath saath langik samanta tathaa gunvattta ke bhi lakshya puure nahin ho sake
 In a Forum meeting in Senegal's capital, Dakar, in the year 2000, 164 countries had vowed that they would be able to teach all by 2015, but by 2012 only 54 per cent of the primary classes were admitted
 unesco kiejucationfar aal kii nigaraanee report ke anusaar duniya main praathmik skulon main daakhila dar ausatan 33 fisadi tha or baarah varshon main isamen 21 fisadi badi he
 In rich countries and in North America and European countries, this percentage was 86 and 89
 dakaar sammelan main sabhi deshon ke liye 2015 tak bajet main 15 se 20 fisadi shiksha ke liye aavantit karne kii sifarish kii gai thi
 But governments and donors spent an average of 13 per cent
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki shiksha ke liye har saal duniya main kareeb 22 arab dollars kii raashi kam padati he
 After the conference, 3 crore 40 lakh children have been admitted so far, but about 5 crore 80 lakh children are still out of school and ten crore children are unable to complete school education

 But the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which has been at the center of the entire political development, seems to get the most benefit in the political ups and downs of the last one month
 vaise to satta kii bagdor shivasena ke pramukh uddhav thakare ke haathon main hogi, lekin is sarkaar ke gathan main nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaane vaali rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) ko kam se kam 3 myanon main joardaar phayda hua
 Especially in the case of succession because the succession case was solved without doing anything in this whole episode
 iske alaava maharashtra kii siyasat main pavaar kaa kad or bad gaya he
 Even at the age of 79, he showed that he is very active
 saath hi nai sarkaar main unki thos hissedari bhi rahegi
 After the election results came, NCP and Sharad Pawar kept saying that the party would sit in opposition but now it is going to be a partner in power
 ab mana ja saktaa he ki sharad pavaar kii beti supriya sule ko party kii bagdor bhi mil sakati he
 Sharad's daughter Supriya and Ajit Pawar have been fighting for a long time for the party's reins
 lekin is baagi tevar se ajit kii sthiti kamjor hi hui he
 Politics changed from the morning of 23 November There was a huge political stir on the morning of 23 November and in an unexpected way Devendra Fadnavis took oath of Chief Minister along with NCP rebel Ajit Pawar
 ajit pavaar ne chachaa sharad pavaar or party ke khilaaf jate hue fadanvis ke saath upmukhyamantri pad kii shapath le lee
 As expected, after this oath, political agitation gained momentum in the state and the process of protecting their legislators started everywhere
 shaam hote-hote ensipi ne vidhayakon kii baithak bulaakar ajit power ko party ke vidhayak dal ke netaa pad se hataa diya or unki jagah jayant patil ko yah jimmedaari saunp di gai
 The NCP chief and 79-year-old Sharad Pawar led the entire case and started celebrating Ajit
 unhone ajit ko lekar lagaataar naram bayaan die or party ke netaaon ko manaane ke liye bhejte rahe
 At the same time, he also kept adding his legislators one by one
 ajit pavaar ko manaane kii koshishsharad pavaar ek ore ajit ko manaane ke liye apane khaas logon ko bhejte rahe to duusari ore shivasena or congress ke saath milakar supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhata diya ki yah shapath grahan galat he or nai sarkaar se turant floor test karaane ko kaha jaae
 On Sunday, the bench of the Supreme Court sat on a holiday and after hearing it for 3 days, issued the order on Tuesday, saying that by 5 pm on Wednesday, the BJP government should prove its majority through floor test
 chachaa sharad pavaar ke saath ajit pavaar (gettyimages)supreme court ke faisle ke baad devendra fadanvis sarkaar sankat main aa gai
 The speed with which Sharad Pawar created moral pressure on Ajit Pawar to resign from the post and join the party seemed that he would not be able to stay away for long
 floor test karaae jane ko lekar court kaa faisla mangalvaar ko kareeb 11 baje aayaa or is faisle ke baad dopaher dhai baje ke aasapaas ajit pavaar ne apane pad se istipha de diya
 About an hour after this resignation, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis also had to resign at 3:30 pm
 istipha dene ke baad ajit pavaar phir ensipi ke saath jud gaye
 However, even after taking oath as Deputy Chief Minister, he kept saying continuously that Sharad Pawar is our leader and i am in NCP only
 kya ajit ne kho diya apana rutabahaalanki donon netaaon ke istife ke baad vivaad to khatm ho gaya, lekin ajit pavaar kii apane chachaa kii party ensipi main jo haisiyat thi, wo shaayad nahin rahi
 It is believed that Ajit Pawar has suffered the most damage in the whole incident
 ab yah sawaal sabhi ke jehan main he ki party main unka kya kad rahegaa
 Whether or not Ajit Pawar gets any responsibility in Uddhav Thackeray's possible new government, or he can be placed in the organizational role of the party
 ajit pehle bhisharad pavaar ko chunauti de chukehain
 During the elections held in the middle of this year, Sharad Pawar announced that he would contest from Maval Lok Sabha seat, but Ajit Pawar's son Parth Pawar from the same seat also rejected the claim to contest
 ajit ne khaasaa dabaav daalkar sharad pavaar ko agali peedi ke naam par peeche hatane ke liye majaboor kar diya
 However, this election Ajit Pawar's son had to face defeat
 phir iske baad sharad pavaar ne apane ek duusare bhattije ko tarjeeh dena shuru kar diya
 Supriya's Dardasupriya Sule is an MP from her father's parliamentary constituency Baramati and Ajit Pawar is an MLA from the Baramati assembly seat when her brother rebels
 ajit pavaar ne is saal oktober main jab vidhansabha kii sadsyta se istipha diya to siyaasi halkon main yah charchaa hone lagi ki supriya or ajit ke bich anban he
 On the day of rebellion of Baramati MP Supriya Sule (file-gettyimages) cousin, Supriya Sule had expressed her disappointment that she had never been cheated in this way, whom to trust now in life
 haalanki aaj buudhvaar ko jab maharashtra vidhansabha main vidhayakon ko shapath dilaayaa ja rahaa tha to pravesh dwaar par donon netaa aapas main gale mili
 But the gestures were telling that Ajit Pawar is still not back to normal
 party line ke ulat jane sbijit pavaar kii vailu main giravatato ai hi he
 Sharad Pawar played a major role in settling the entire incident peacefully
 ajit pavaar ke baagi tevar se sharad ko thodaa phayda bhi hua hoga kyonki is vivaad ke baad party main unka kad or bad gaya
 Also, who should be handed over the command of the party from Beti Supriya or Ajit, he came out of this dilemma and now he can unquestionably hand over the reins of party to the daughter
 ajit ko pad nahin saunpane kaa sabase bada jawaab to yahi hoga ki vah party kii dophaad karaane kii koshish kar chuke hai

 Air pollution and water pollution have increased significantly due to steel industry in Delhi, but due to dpcc's failure to curb around 62 big units of Delhi, TNT was so angry that the court imposed a fine of 50 crores on Delhi government
 engiti ne kaha ki hamaare baar-baar die gaye adeshon kaa paalan ab tak nahin kiya gaya he
 The court said that the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has not yet given an affidavit as to why electricity and water connections have been given for these units
 The court said that should we order the DPCC chairman to arrest him for this? During the hearing, the judge was so angry that he said, "tell yourself whether you should be fined 500 crores or 100 crores for your careless attitude?" While writing the order, the court fined the Delhi government 50 crore

 In addition, the steel is cleaned with acid before polishing, and then water is used

 The court questioned how the Delhi Pollution Control Committee gave permission for installation of electricity and water connections to run these units when it is completely illegal, and the DPCC has no authority to grant NOC to these units
 
 court ne kaha ki dilli pradooshan control board ke ek-ek adhikari ke khilaaf ham mukadmaa chalaayenge jisane is cese main hamaare adeshon kaa paalan nahin kiya
 The NGT said that if the Delhi government had not given orders to close these units, should the DPCC also have to stand up? While reprimanding the Additional Secretary of the DPCC, the NGT said, "why have you not done your duty?" appal ne 4 inch kaa nayaa iphone SE bharat or china ke customers ko dhyaan main rakhkar launch kiya he

 ‘lats ol haev sex’
 'let's all have sex all day
 ’khud ko sambhaaliye
 For a while
 jab tak ham us sahitya kii baat karenge jisase ham vanchit rahete hai
 i sincerely apologize for this impudence - especially those who have been hurt by it
 mujhe ye sasti trick isliye apnaani padi, kyonki main chahta tha ki jo bhi is tarah kii ghatiya maansikta vaale (ham main se zyaadaatar hai) ve ise jarur padhein
 Why are we silent? Just two days ago i got 'one Part Woman' (original book in Tamil- 'madhorubagan')
 is kitaab ko maine usee din online order kiya, jis din perumal murugan ne apni sari kitaaben waapas lete hue apni kalam or jindagi donon ko ek saath alavida kah diya
 In it, i can smell the aroma of the soil of that particular place which is described in the language which i understand properly - English
 ye kriti wo tasviren ukerti he jinase main khud ko judaa hua mahasoos karata hum
 i can see the plant which a person plants in the barren yard of his father-in-law
 meraa sawaal unase he jinhone apni saahitiyik samaj ko darkinar kar diya he
 After all, why do we allow gothis? yahi hamaara ‘main hum perumal’ pal he
 This is our parable on 'one Part Woman' - but we remain silent
 khun kaa ek kataraa bhi nahin baha lekin aatma mar gai
 The sound of the guns was not heard, but the pen became silent
 perumal ke ped kii kaat-chhaant kyon?ye to unki ghor sankeern maansikta hi he, jinka dhulmul sammaan is baat par nirbhar hota he ki aakhir fiction likhaa kaise gaya he? usamen buddhijivi urvartaa kaa abhaav hota he or usee ke parinamswaroop perumal ke ped kii kaat-chhaant hoti he
 Lakhs are with the letters, but their brain is not taking initiative
 unke hone kaa arth viksit hi nahin ho sakaa he
 His inner eye has not been revealed
 ve ab bhi idhar-udhar khaak chaan rahe hai
 Not 'good education' or 'illiteracy', but we are struggling with the wrath of 'illiteracy'
 ye fiction he, fact to nahinupanyaaskaar aisa plot gadhata he, jisase vah khud gaharaai tak judaa hua hota he
 He is aware of those people and their culture
 or is perumal ne to un logon par na to koi report likhi he, na hi unka aadhikarik itihaas
 He has merely engraved his imagination on paper with a pen
 fiction main takaraav kii gunjaaish hoti he or lekhak ko is baat kii aazaadee hoti he ki vah apane charitron ko jis rang-rup main chaahe garh sake
 If a reader disagrees with all readers, they should not read it
 agar koi pathak ye jane bagaiyr kitaab padhanaa band kar detaa he ki uski usase asahmati ho sakati he
 Then why is there a need to spew venom on the writer? If he wants to, he can decide not to read the other books of that writer - at least that is the proper way
 phir to koi lekhak samaaj kii un buraaiyon par kalam chalaane se bhi parhez karne lagegaa jo unhen khokhla banaati hai
 'main Hain Perumal'! There have always been idealistic novelist and fierce opponents
 chintaa kii baat ye he ki system in murkh or ganvaaron par lagaam kasne ke liye kuch nahin karata
 The sad part is that we are unable to muster the courage to wear a T-shirt with 'main Hain Perumal'
 sabase khatarnaak baat to ye he ki ek aisa maahaul banane laga he jisamen ujaddon ko paanv pasaarne kaa mauka miltaa he – or abhivyakti kii aazaadee par hamale hote hai
 Perumal Murugan Died - Live Thousands of Years Perumal Murugan
 ab agar kisi kaa culture aahat nahin hota to jaao or sex karo
 Let's all have intercourse
 chalo sabhi har vakt sambhog karte hai
 And gather like rabbits - because our mind is moving on the path of being compressed

 In the Panchayat elections of West Bengal, the BJP is facing great embarrassment due to major lapses in its manifesto
 menifesto main hinsa kii jin tasveeron ko bengal se judaa bataaya gaya he wo darasal bangladesh kii hai
 The party released the manifesto on Tuesday
 menifesto kii bocolate ke cover ke pichley hisse par in tasveeron ko kolaj ke taur par prakashit kiya gaya he
 The photos were taken in Bangladesh during the violence that erupted in 2013 following lawsuits related to war crimes
 bijepi ne aisi tasveeron kaa istemaal apane propaganda ke hisse ke taur par kiya he
 The BJP often makes allegations of repression of Hindus in West Bengal under Mamata Banerjee's rule
 tasviir main pradarshnakariyon ko muslim topi pahane or haath main laathiyaan liye dekha ja saktaa he
 Some vehicles are seen burning in the background
 vahiin, is masale ko lekar trinmul congress ne bijepi par palatwaar kiya he
 In the Mamata Banerjee government, Education Minister Partha Chatterjee said in the photo of the Bangladesh violence in the BJP manifesto that the Election Commission's code of conduct is in force and the Kolkata Police should act on it
 partha chatarji ne kaha, ‘bijepi netaa feku dada ban gaye hai
 They do not believe in values in line with folklore traditions
 ve sirf do samudaayon ke bich khinchaav paidaa karnaa jaanate hai
 'damaged idols of Hindu deities can also be seen in some other photographs

 This picture is probably from the same time

 When asked about the use of such photographs, Ghosh said, 'this was done to show the situation in today's West Bengal which needs to be changed
 bengal ko afghanistan banane kii taiyaari ho rahi he jise ham badal kar sonar bangla banaaenge
 Only BJP can lead this change
 ’ye pehali baar nahin he jababijepi ne farji yaa asambandhit tasveeronko bengal kaa bataate hue jari kiya
 During the Basirhat violence last year, BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma had uploaded a picture describing him as Bengal, which was actually of the 2002 Gujarat violence

 is saal box offis par filmon kii kamai ke 'dangal' main 'sultan' sabit hue hai salmaan khan
 But whenever the name of this Khan comes, a mystery also surrounds it
 salmaan ke bade-bade fain yahi sochate hai ki kya salmaan vaaki utane hi akkhad or garam mizaaj hai, jitna ki khabaren bataati hai
 How is 'bhai' implicated in the hit and run and Chinkara case in real life - is he polite in talking to others or does not understand anything in front of himself
 vaise salmaan khan ko lekar jo bhi rahasy bana hua he, us par se pardaa uthaaya he unke saath kaam kar chuke ek hariyaanvi actor, naveen ahalyaan ne
 In the new film 'sultan', Salman Khan's father has been played and in a special conversation he told that he has experience working with Salman: - Not at all fanatic
 Baht was tense as to what would happen to the superstar, but with Salman it was felt that he lived in air
 pehali meeting main hi vah khulkar baat karne waalon main se hai
 As he is said to have very tantrums, this is not the case
 'dabang' or 'sultan' main se koun si film he behatar
 
 
 Naveen says about his 'screen son' who makes a personal bond, Kiselman has a very good temperament and he talks exactly as if you have a family member
 unki yah aadat unit ke har kalakaar ke saath thi or set par aane ke baad ve sabase hill-milakar baat karte hai

Last year, when the heat of the assembly elections in Delhi was increasing, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) lambasted the then Sheila Dixit government for failing to protect the women of the entire city for crimes like rape against women
 Posters were pasted on autorickshaws
 
 
 darasal, disambar, 2012 main chalati bas main ek para-medical chaatra ke saath hue nrushans gangrape ke baad sari dilli gusse se ubal rahi thi, or usee maahaul main chipkaae gaye 'aap' ke in postaron ne janata ko arvind kejariwal kii party ko vot dene ke liye protsaahit kar diya, taaki rajdhani kii mahilaayein surakshit rahen
 
 
 The issue of safety of women also figured prominently in aap's election promises, in which Sheila Dixit was also criticized for not taking very effective steps to improve policing in the city, because The Delhi Police works under the Central Government, not the State Government
 
 
 shila dikshit par aarope lagaaya gaya ki vah apni samasyaon se 'pallaa jhaad' rahi hai
 
 
 But when the news of Tuesday's gang-rape with a 51-year-old citizen of Denmark near Connaught Place area in the heart of Delhi city came to light on Wednesday, Aam Aadmi Party's party challenged Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi from Amethi constituency in Uttar Pradesh Senior leader Kumar Vishwas was also heard speaking the same language
 
 
 unhone bhi gangrape ke bare main puche jane par vahi jawaab diya, "dilli police dilli ke mukhyamantri ke tahat kaam nahin karti hai
 
 
 " udhar, dilli ke mukhyamantri or aam aadmi party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne to is mudde par sirf itnaa hi kaha, "main is bare main abhi baat hi nahin karnaa chahta
 
 
 "apart from this, Arvind Kejriwal or another senior colleague of his cabinet Manish Sisodia, who is the only authorized person to speak on the issue on behalf of the party, was not available to comment on the matter
 
 
 jo press conference inamen se ek netaa rose shaam ko kiya karte hai, vah bhi buudhvaar ko radd kar di gai
 
 
 On the other hand, while retaliating against the AAP over the issue, former Chief Minister Sheila Dixit's son and Congress spokesperson Sandeep Dixit said, "this rape is not an issue for AAP, because the victim woman is not their voter
" 
 
 " Former US President Barack Obama said at an event in Delhi on Friday that he had a friendship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but he also had a lot of respect with former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 unhone kaha ki donon hi netaa bahut prabhavi hai
 Manmohan Singh was our first partner when we were struggling with the economic downturn
 pradhanmantri modi paris samjhaute ke saath hamaare sahyogi the
 In response to a question about Modi, he said that i like him
 mujhe lagata he ki bharat ke liye unke paas vijan he
 They are engaged in modernizing the bureaucracy

 Globalization, terrorism and non-equity are responsible for this
 unhone kaha ki duniya bhar main hinsa main kami ai he, jaisaa ki maanavtaa ke itihaas main hinsa dekhne ko milti he
 The former US President said that India and America have partnerships on many values
 jaise ki vividhta or sahishnutaa, ek udaaravaadi bazaar or vyaktigat adhikaar
 
 
 Speaking about the negative impact of technology, Obama said that people want to find stability amidst all kinds of changes
 ham pehle is tarah ke maahaul se guzar chuke hai
 From agriculture to industrial sector
 mahatvapurn ye he ki inaki-unki raajnneeti ko peeche dhakelnaa
 We have to carry forward the values that we all share
 trump se zyada folover hai mere palmerica raashtrapati donald trump par tanj kasate hue obama ne kaha ki mere paas kuch logon se zyada folover the, jo aksar ise yuj karte hai
 Regarding his tweet, Obama said that i use the idiom in my text
 donald dak or donald trump main se america kaa pratinidhitiv koun karata he ke sawaal par purv america raashtrapati ne kaha ki america kii vividhta ko main pasand karata hum
 Contradictory is that American political trends are part of life
 america ke bare main jo khushi or frustation kii baat he wo ye he ki america virodhabhasi ho saktaa he
 We can also be kind and unkind
 mujhe lagata he ki bharat ke saath bhi yahi he
 'trust in democracy, so do not be silent', Obama said that the partnership of the world's oldest and largest democracy is decisive

 He said that those who believe in democracy need to speak on issues

 'I like lentils and make minced meat', he said, "I will be the first American president, who had a lentil recipe, i make a fabulous minced meat but the chicken is not as good
" roti bananaa bahut mushkil he, meri roti badhiya nahin hoti
 Talking about unity and participation in the Indian democracy keeping in mind its social unity, he said that in a country like India, there is a large population of Muslims and all people live together
 haalanki durbhaagya kii baat he ki har desh main aisa nahin hota he
 India needs to be proud of and cherish its partnership and unity
 pragati ke liye ekta main vishwaas karte hai modiunhone kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ekta main vishwaas karte hai
 They believe that progress is very important for development
 is mudde par pradhanmantri ke jawaab ke bare main obama ne kaha ki agar koi rajaneta aisa karata he, to is par sawaal uthaanaa jaruri he
 He said that you can ask yourself a question about what i am promoting
 agar bhartiya samudaay kahata he ki ve bantwaare kii raajnneeti main nahin ulajhenge, to ye un netaaon ke liye behatar hai, jo ekta ko badhaava dena chaahate hai
 Obama said that leaders represent the society itself

 We wanted to end terror together with India after the 26 / 11 Mumbai attack
 kisi bhi tarah kaa aatank sabko prabhavit karata he
 In the last three years, around 300 people have been killed in the honor killing incidents in the country
 ye jaankaree loksabhaa main khud sarkaar ne di he
 In response to a question, Home Minister Hansraj Ahir presented the figures of those killed in Honor Killing from 2014 to 2016
 loksabhaa main ahir ne jo data pesh kiya uske mutabik saal 2014 main honor kiling ke 28 maamle saamne aae the
 But in the very next year, 2015, it saw a huge jump and the number of people killed in Honor Killing increased almost six times to 192
 haalanki 2016 main aisi ghatnaon main kami ai or honor kiling ke 68 maamle darj kiye gaye
 However, the government does not have any such data to know how many women or girls are out of the total 288 people who have received Honor Killing in the last three years
 ahir ke mutabik marane waalon ke ling ke aadhaar par koi vargeekaran nahin kiya gaya tha
 The increasing incidents of honor killing suggest that conservative thinking still dominates our society and people do not hesitate to commit heinous crimes like killing their own people for the sake of false pride of themselves and their families
 punjab uniwarsity main mangalvaar ko fees vruddhi ke khilaaf pradarshan kar rahe chaatro or chandigarh police ke bich hui jhadap ke maamle main mangalvaar der raat police ne pradarshan kar rahe chaatro par deshadroh kaa maamla laga diya tha
 After this, the Vice Chancellor of Punjab University asked the police to withdraw the case of treason
 upkulapati ne chandigarh police se kaha ki maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay yaa phir ujisi ke khilaaf naare lagaana deshadroh kii shrenee main shaamil nahin he
 Although now the dispute over this whole matter is increasing, Chandigarh Police is saying that the police had registered a case of treason against 53 students who were arrested earlier, but later the police rectified their mistake and removed the sedition section in this case
 is
 kya kehete hai chandigarh police dcpmamgalavara ko hue baari hangaame ke baad buudhvaar ko bhi uniwarsity main kai jagah chandigarh police or chaatro ke bich takaraav dikhaai diya
 Actually the Chandigarh Police has converted the entire campus into a camp
 students ko har jagah se khadeda ja rahaa he
 Students are saying that even the policemen are harassing those who stand somewhere from their work
 unhen uthaakar thane le ja rahe hai
 There is resentment among the students that the police have filed a case of sedition against the protesting students
 students kehete hai ki unhone desh virdohi naare nahin lagaae or naa hi uniwarsity main lage tirange kaa apmaan kiya
 Despite this, the police took strong action against them
 is puure fees vruddhi ke vivaad par uniwarsity ke vaais chancelar kii chuppi se bhi students khaase naaraaz hai
 What does the Vice Chancellor say in this whole matter? Silently, the Vice Chancellor Arun Kumar Grover broke his silence on the ruckus of the fee hike in the university for the last 12 days and said that the police had mistakenly imposed a sedition on the students of the university
 unhone police se kah kar is dhara ko hatwaya
 The vice-chancellor said that the entire Senate has implemented the fee hike in view of all the circumstances and they cannot take the decision on the increase of these fees alone
 iske liye UGC, centre sarkaar, punjab prashasan orchandigarh prashasanako milakar faisla lenaa hoga
 Vice Chancellor said that the university's image has been tarnished by this controversy
 puri duniya main punjab uniwarsity kaa kaaphi naam he or ve uniwarsity ke community FM radio stesan ke madhyam se chaatro ko fees vruddhi ke peeche ke kaarnon ko lekar safai bhi de chuke hai
 The vice-chancellor said that the students should understand that the controversy would spoil the image of the university and assured the students that they would continue their talks but violence would not be tolerated on any condition

 vitt mantri ne branded paridhaan nirmaataaon par utpaada shulk anivaary karne ke prastaav main kuch riyaayat di jisase unhen ab keval 45 pratishat mulya par utpaada shulk dena hoga
 On February 28, Mukherjee had proposed to impose an excise duty at the rate of ten percent on 60 percent of the value of such garments in the 2011-12 budget
 loksabhaa main vitt vidheyak 2011 ko pesh karte huye vitt mantri ne kaha, ‘swasthya kshetra par prastaavit nayaa sevakar keval rajasav vasuuli ke liye nahin lagaaya gaya tha balki iskaa uddeshy vastu evam sevakar (jiesti) kii disha main aage badhanaa tha

 ise lekar upabhoktaaon or vyapaariyon donon hi ke bich kaaphi sanshay kii sthiti he
 The government is calling it a game changer, but many questions have arisen regarding its implementation and implementation
 kendriya mantri prakaash jaavdekar 'ajtak' ke khaas kaarykram main darshakon ke sawaalon kaa LIVE jawaab de rahe hai or unke kanfusion dur kar rahe hai
 Prakash Javadekar has clearly said that the society is not very comfortable about tax and wants to save tax by hiding his income

 But there are still 13–17 lakh traders who are yet to be registered
 anshuman tiwari ke mutabik jiesti utana aasaan nahin he jitna bataaya ja rahaa he
 The government is going to face difficulties in dealing with challenges at the theoretical level
 rajya, centre or intregatid jiesti alag-alag hai aise main teenon ke saath samanvay karne main dikkat aane vaali he
 On the question of taxing goods related to education, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said that rubber, cutters, books were already taxed, there is no separate tax on these items

 Separate taxes related to transportation have been added to one

 Buying branded goods will cost you more than before

 This will benefit the poor village of the country
 unhone kaha ki sansad main 36 raajnneetik dalon ne milakar yah pranali banaai he or hamen isaki ahmiyat samajni chahie

 " The historical legacy of Nawab Bangash Khan who settled the city of Farrukhabad is slowly turning into rubble
 bangash khan kii puratathvik dharoharen hi nahin balki nawab ke vanshaj bhi aaj muflisi kii jindagi jeene ko majaboor hai
 The tomb of Mohammad Khan Bangash, who settled the city of Farrukhabad in the name of the Mughal ruler, Farrukhsiyar, is under the Archaeological Department, but alcoholics and gamblers have built a base around the tomb and the tomb of Nawab Bangash Khan is being used for children to play
 
 kuch saal pehle teen sau saal puraane is makbare kii gumbad ko bachaane ke liye puraatatv vibhaag ne yahaan kuch kaam karavaaya tha lekin uske baavjood is aitihaasik makbare kaa bada hissaa jameendos ho chukaa he
 Apart from Mohammad Khan Bangash in Farrukhabad city, the Nawab of Kabul and the Bangash family also have many mausoleums but some have been found in the soil and some have been occupied by the land mafia
 nawab mohammad khan bangash ke vanshaj kazim hossain khan bangash bataate hai ki ve har saal anurodh karte hai ki isaki boundry karvaa di jaae
 Anti-social elements remain seated here
 jua khelte hai or sharaab pite rahete hai
 He said that this could be a picnic spot for Farrukhabad
 log ise dekhne aaenge or pahachaanenge ki ye farrukhabad ke sansthaapak he
 Not only the historical heritage associated with Nawab Bangash Khan, his heirs are also victims of the plight
 nawab bangash khan kii 11 veen peedi ke vaaris kazim hossain khan bangash kashiram awaas yojana ke makaan main apane bete or bahu ke saath rahete hai
 Somehow they are passing the life of their family by making a form at a doctor
 swatantraaa andolan main hissaa lene ke chalate inke teen pardaadaon ko faansee de di gai or ek ko desh nikaala de diya gaya tha
 Kazim says that we too would have lived like the Nawabs today, but our biggest mistake was to participate in the freedom movement
 kazim hossain ne kaha, 'hamaari yahi achchhai yaa galati samaj lijie ki ham angrejon se lade or ham tabah ho gaye
 One of our three great-grandfathers was executed and one was confiscated and all our property was confiscated
 ' unhone kaha ki jo desh ke liye kabhi nahin lade kalakatta sangram yaa meerut main kabhi bhaag nahin liya ve aaj nawabon kii jindagi ji rahe hai or ham choti si naukari karke guzar basar kar rahe hai
 Mohammad Khan Bangash and his descendants who settled Farrukhabad three hundred years ago have twenty mausoleums here
 lekin sab mitthi ke dher main tabdeel ho rahe hai
 a few days later, the coming generations will probably never know about Mohammed Khan Bangash who settled Farrukhabad and his heirs who ended up fighting the British

 big bos 13 main siddharth shukla or aseem riyaj ko ram-lakshmana kaa tag diya gaya
 But this friendship, which gives friendship goals, is now badly broken
 mangalvaar ke episod main donon ke bich jabardast ladaai hui
 siddharth-aseem pushed each other, abused
 donon ek-duusare ko target karte dikhe
 It is difficult to say that the patch between them will ever have a patchup
 siddharth ko in 4 celebs kaa saportsidharth shukla or aseem riyaj ke bich hue hivoltage drame ke baad soshal media do grups main bant gaya he
 Some are in support of the Siddha Rath and some are in the limitless
 is bich eks big bos contestant vindu daara singh or kamya punjabi ne siddharth shukla kaa saport kiya he
 Kamya Punjabi tweeted and wrote- Aseem you need to chill
 isaki koi jarurat nahin thi
 You first started the issue without any reason
 # disappointing # bigboss13 @colorstv # asimriyazyou need to chill man
 
 this was not required, you started it for no reason # disappointing # bigboss13@colorstv— Kamya Punjabi (@iamkamyapunjabi)november 19, 2019duusari tarafvindu darasingh siddharth ke phul saport main dikhe
 He has made numerous tweets in favor of the actor and has targeted Aseem Riyaz
 vindu ne aseem ko negative vichaaron vaala shaks bataaya
 They are making WESTANDBYYOUSIDSHUKLA # staystrongsidharth # staystrongsidshukla trend in support of Siddharth
 When Sid was at log-heads with co-contestants over personal & Asim’s issues than Asim & his fans didn’t find him aggressivein the end what did Asim do?he used the same provoking tactics used by the rest!sid is playing solo inside & so are his fans outside! # staystrongsidharth— Vindu Dara Singh (@realvindusingh)november 19, 2019vindu ne likhaa-asimko koi nahin jaanata tha
 He would have become Evict much earlier if Siddhartha had not been with him
 siddharth ne misses beautiphul ko himain banane main madad kii
 Now Heiman has become the confidant after Rashmi and Devolina's aviation, so he starts fighting everyone
 Asim was a nobody who would hv been evicted long ago had it not been forsidsid helped Ms Beautiful transform into a hemanheman became over confident post Rashmi & Devo eviction &started fighting with alltom i will be live on voot!wil talk why i choose Sid # staystrongsidharth— Vindu Dara Singh (@realvindusingh)november 19, 2019I would prefer an enemy who is upfront and directasim has so much of negative thoughts &can’t see the good in a friend & othersnow the fans can separate too
 Sid can play on his own & Sid is the show stopper! (@realvindusingh) November 19, 2019 Actor Karanvir Bohra tweeted in support of Nisiddharth - Asim knows how Siddhartha talks
 use pehle siddharth ko gaali nahin deni chahie thi
 Above that, he has to push Shukla first
 ye line cross karnaa he
 When # asimknows how his friend # sidharthshuklatalks
 He shouldn't have abused him in the first place and to top it all, her pushed # shukla, that is crossing the line
 # istandwithsidharthshukla # biggboss13 # bb13 — Karanvir Bohra 🇮🇳 (@kvbohra) November 19, 2019 krkane also tweeted for Siddharth - let me make one thing clear again, whatever happens but Siddharth Shukla is running Bigg Boss till the last day Don't win that trophy
 Let me clear it again
 Whatever will happen but # sidharthshuklawill run the show till last day to win the trophy of # biggbos13! - KRK (@kamaalrkhan) November 19, 2019asim must be insecure but the truth is also that Sid should respect and talk nicely to his friends
 
 and also listen to their point of view !! Others can't always be wrong 🤷🏻♀️ # biggbos13— Kishwer m Rai (@kishwerm) November 19, 2019 Why did the battle of siddharth-aseem? Both get entangled over the fruits during Shahnazgil's Swayamvar task
 siddharth ne aseem se santara maanga, lekin aseem ne santara dene se manaa kar diya
 Aseem then abused Siddhartha
 isse aag babula hue siddharth agressive ho gaye
 Siddharth came close to Asim and saw him poking him
 tabhi aseem ne unhen dhire se peeche hataaya to siddharth ne aseem ko jor ke dhakka diya
 Then both of them started pushing with each other
 donon kii ladaai puure episod kaa sabase bada hilite rahi
 The two were seen non-stop commenting on each other
 lagbhag sabhi partiyon kii sahmati se sansad ne nyaayik niyukti ayog vidheyak paarit kar diya he
 It has triggered a heated debate in the fraternity of media and law experts
 kuch kaa kahana he ki yah sahi disha main uthaaya gaya kadam he or kuch kaa maananaa isse ulat he
 Conversely, those who are of the opinion are predicting that this bill / law will become invalid as it is contrary to the basic structure of the Constitution
 supreme court ne jab se faisla kiya he ki raashtrapati ko supreme court or hycourt main un jajon kii niyukti kerani chahie, jinaki sifarish mukhya nyaayadhish ke netritv main paanch jajon kaa collegium karegaa, tabhi se is mudde par kaaphi bahes ho rahi he
 Since this decision actually means that a board of judges should decide who their co-workers and successors will be, there is a feeling of uneasiness about this arrangement
 rajnatik varg or sarkaar kii manshaa ke bare main pehle se chale aa rahe baari andeh ke is maahaul main niyuktiyon ke maamle main nyaaypalika kii ore se purna swatantraaa kii ghoshnaa kii pehle kaaphi tarif kii gai thi or ise nyaaypalika kii jeet bataaya gaya tha
 But with the passage of time, voices of skepticism from the judiciary and legal circles as well as civil society began to arise regarding this system and its legitimacy
 jajon kii niyukti kii vyavastha main sanshodhan karne ke liye kanoon banane kii maujuuda pahal lambey samay se collegium vyavastha kii tikadamon ke kaaran rajya vyavastha ke vibhinn angon ke bich paidaa hone vaale tanaav kaa hi nateeja he
 The debate focuses on the concept that the inclusion of one of the other two pillars of the state system - the executive and the legislature - in the appointment of judges will affect the independence of the judiciary
 lihaaja, yah janhit main nahin he
 But in such an argument, the issue of accountability of the judiciary is missed, whereas without it the legitimacy of the judiciary is definitely under question
 rajya vyavastha kii vibhinn sansthaaon kii swatantraaa jaruri or vaanchhneeya he, lekin ve puri tarah se belgaum hon, yah bhi thik nahin
 The best way to ensure accountability, fairness, and honesty of various institutions is to force them to put what they do in public
 badakismati se maujuuda bahes main is baat ko or kai anya mahatvapurn muddon ko chhod diya gaya he, jo meri raay main kisi bhi tarah se kam mahatvapurn nahin hai
 The first issue relates to lack of complete clarity and transparency not only in the process of appointment of judges but also in the system of dealing with allegations of corruption against judges and cases of wrongful conduct
 jajon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar or galat aacharan kii shikayaton kii sunwaayee ke maamle main nyaaypalika ke paas hi puraa adhikaar he
 Many people, including retired judges, sometimes refer to corruption in the judiciary, either privately or occasionally publicly, but nothing is spoken out openly and kept in public
 jajon ke bhrashtachar ke vishay par charchaa se bachane kii ek badi vajah adaalat kii avmaananaa kaa dar he
 Furthermore, he feels that the judiciary can do no wrong
 isse unhen anischitata ke is daur main suraksha kaa ehsaas hota he
 But this type of situation will not last long
 justise markandeya katju ke kuch khulaason ko jis tarah se media main jagah mili he, vah nyaaypalika ke khilaaf sugabugahat kaa spasht sanket he
 The time has come for the judiciary to appoint an impartial officer to investigate the grievances against its members and make the results of its investigation public
 ek anya badi chintaa jajon kii yogyata ko lekar bhi he
 It is not enough to keep the judges away from the interference of the executive and legislature, it is equally important that they should be completely free from the influence of other forces outside the government
 lekin nyaaypalika kii nigaraanee ke liye kisi sakasham vyakti kii talash karnaa kathin hota ja rahaa he
 We should not deceive ourselves that we have a huge stock of legal talent from which to appoint judges
 vaastaviktaa yah he ki hamaara yah bhandar bahut simit he
 Many people say that a large number of posts in the country's High Court are lying vacant because of the shortage of qualified candidates
 agar puure maamle ko isi nazariye se dekha jaae to nyaaypalika kii saapekshik swatantraaa ko behatar dhang se samajha ja saktaa he
 Come to the issue of transparency and leave the matter of transparency in the appointments, in recent years, RTI activists have not got any success in getting information from the Supreme Court in cases of corruption charges against judges
 is tarah kii soochnaaon kaa khulaasa na karne ke peeche ek standard tark yah diya jaataa he ki isse nyaaypalika kii swatantraaa par asar padegaa
 Whatever the final outcome of this bill, but the time has come that the judiciary will have to respond to the complaints against its members and put the whole truth before the public
 apni swatantraaa banaae rakhane ke liye yah utana hi jaruri he, jitna ki jajon kii niyukti kii prakriya ko banaae rakhana

 in / On Thursday, the RBI governor cut the repo rate by 25 basis points amid the declining economy
 yani ab bank arabiai se sasti dar par karz le paaenge
 This has again raised hopes of cheaper credit for home loans as well as industry
 arabiai ke governor ne ek raahat bainkon ko di or duusari aam logon ko

 This is not a scientific fantasy

 And yes, these drone aircraft also have a name - ALFA-S, ie air-launched Flexible Asset (swarm)
 naam prakashit nahin karne kii shart par ek project manager ne kaha, "arial warfere (hawaii yudhak pranali) kaa yahi bhavishya he
 
 
 "the project manager said," With the continuing maturity in Artificial Intelligence technology, such smart drones that we want to build will be able to replace at least a handful of pilots in the most dangerous missions, and allow the Air Force to carry out combat operations
 i will not have to lose pilots to unacceptable limits
 
 
 "yah swarm drone project is vajah se khaastaur se praasangik ho jaataa he, kyonki 'pakistan ke hawaii suraksha network ko badhaane kii yojana' taiyaar he
 
 
 ALFA-S drones working in flocks have two foldable wings, and are between one and two meters in length
 kai drone ko bhartiya vayusena ke vimaanon ke pankhons ke neeche lage canstar-numa bakse main feet kar diya jaataa he
 The Indian Air Force pilot then takes the aircraft to such an altitude where it is protected from enemy aircraft and missiles, and then the drone is released
 iske baad apane pankhons ko failaakar udana shuru karne vaale drone main lagi bydaree unhen 100kilometre prati ghante se bhi tej raftaar dene main sakasham hoti he
 The battery is built in such a way that it lasts for two hours, and within that time the swarm of drone planes will reach the target
 shuruaati drone prototip ko hindustan aironautics main taiyaar kiye ja rahe hoque advanced jet trainer (hawk Advanced Jet Trainer)se launch kiya jane kii sambhaavna he,lekin antat in dronon ko bhartiya vayusena ke vimaanon - ladaaku jet yaa parivahan vimaan - se hi launch kiya janaa he
 According to the project manager, "all drones are fully connected to each other through electronic data-links
 
 
 apane infrared tathaa electro-optical sensoron kaa istemaal karte hue drone dushman kii sataha se hawa main maar karne vaali missile pranali,dushman ke radar or sataha par khadey dushman vimaanon jaise apane nishaanon ko talash lete hai
 
 
 Each drone has been made so 'smart' so that it can 'understand' what has been discovered, and then the targets are assigned to different drones
 
 
 "iske baad har drone aatmghaatee hamalaa karata he - apane bheetar maujuud visphotakon ke saath vah nishane se takaraa jaataa he
 For this, a lot of technology being developed in the country is not available in the market
 america,china,rus tathaa kuch europea desh apane swarm-drone strike package ke shuruaati hisse viksit karne main jute hai
 One of the project designers of the ALFA-S system stated, "trials are being conducted all over the world in this area, and no country will share swarming technology with any other country
 
 
 "yah swarm drone project is vajah se khaastaur se praasangik ho jaataa he,kyonki'pakistan ke hawaii suraksha network ko badhaane kii yojana'taiyaar he,jiske tahat sambhawatah china-nirmit sataha se hawa main maar karne valiox-9missile system ko hasil kiya ja saktaa he

 The plan to develop indigenous swarming drones is part of the Combat Air Teaming System Project or CATS, which has three different parts
 alfa-ssvarma dronon ke alaava robotic wingman,jo maanavyukt ladaaku vimaan ke saath yuddh main jayega,bhi viksit kiya ja rahaa he
 The final part of CATS will be to develop ultra-high altitude drones that can fly for up to three weeks at a time, sending real-time photos and videos

 Among the ambitious proposals that were discussed, the dispute over the 16 areas along the Line of Actual Control is very important because there is a lot of ambiguity about the border areas between the two countries

 He said that the two countries are also willing to ignore the differences over China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as India said that it could not give up its opposition to China's ambitious campaign CPEC project because the road was occupied by Pakistan-occupied Kashmir

 Exit poll has given a major blow to Arvind Kejriwal, who claimed to win all seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi
 unki aam aadmi party(aap) ko agsit pole main ek bhi siten milti nahin dikh raheen hai
 The most reliable Aaj Tak - According to Exit Poll of Axis My India, BJP in Delhi is seen doing a clean sweep

 The BJP won all seven seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 yun to nattejey 23 may ko aaenge, magar agsit pole puri tarah sahi sabit hue to phir arvind kejariwal or unki party ke liye lagaataar bada jhatka hoga
 Because this will be the second Lok Sabha election after 2014, in which the Aam Aadmi Party will not get a single seat
 do saal pehle hue dilli nagar nigam chunaav ko bhi arvind kejariwal kii sattadhari party haar chuki he
 What is the magic of Kejriwal fading? It was Arvind Kejriwal, who won the 2015 assembly election by winning a resounding majority in the 2015 assembly elections by lighting up the hopes of the common man
 70 main se 67 vidhansabha siton par aam aadmi party kii jeet ne na keval raajnneetik panditon ko hairaan kar diya tha, balki party ke bhi kuch netaa bhi in nateezon se chaunk uthe the

 International arms dealer Adnan Khashoghin helped Mehsen Ali Khan to open an account with Zurich-based UBS Bank, which was used to make his black money white and for the Pune-based horse farm owner Khan to buy a hotel in Switzerland for 28
58 million Swiss francs ( Swiss currency) was a very small amount
 pravartan nideshaalay kii ore se dhanshodhan nirodhak kanoon ke tahat khan or kolkata ke vyapaaree kashinath tapuria ke khilaaf daakhil kiye gaye aaropapatr ke tahat khan khashogi ke liye kaam kar rahaa he
 Khan's UBS account was used to deposit the arms smuggler's money
 950 panne ke is aaropapatr main kaha gaya he ki tapuria ne bataaya he ki khashogi ne khan ko varsh 1982 main bank main parichay karaayaa tha
 According to Tapuria, he came to know from UBS manager Reto Hartmon that the money deposited in Khan's account was actually a weapon smuggler
 usne kaha ki aisa sambhav ho saktaa he ki khashogi ne ubies ke purv karmchaaree evam uske portpholio manager peter veli ko nirdesh diya ho ki vah khan ko khate se ek nishchit seemaa se adhik dhan na nikaalane de
 Tapuria told the Enforcement Directorate officials that once Khan had shown the bank statement of his bank account in Zurich for the year 2005-2006
 us samay khate main do arab dollars jamaa the
 Tapuria told during interrogation that Khan had told him the secret code of operating the account which was 'black Pincers'
 khan ne peter veli kii sifarish par hi apane khate se 30 karod dollars khashogi ke khate main sthanantarit kiye jisane baad main yah raashi khan ke khate main waapas kar di
 The amount was later declared black money after which Khan's UBS account was banned
 aaropapatr ke anusaar, tapuria ne kaha ki bharat main rahane ke baavjood khan ko khashogi kii gatividhiyon ke bare main jaankaree thi
 The chargesheet states that Khan's aide Phillip Anandraj said in his statement that the Pune-based real estate consultant wanted to buy a hotel in Chatto Gutsch, Switzerland

 aaj kii charchaa kya us televijan set par bhi dekhi jaaegi jo dahez main aayaa he
 How can he see the whole family sitting on the sofa set, which is known from the in-laws and landed from the Tata 407
 lekin, dahez or isse judi yaatnaaon par bahes agar sirf apni kamai se tivi set kharidne vaale hi dekhenge to thik baat nahin hogi
 Everyone should see
 mujhe pataa he mere darshakon ke ghar main na dahez kaa tivi set he na sopha set
 You may have turned down the amount of dowry and would have written on the car of Fokat from the in-law's house, the bride is the dowry
 matlab dahez chahie
 If nothing is found, the bride should become a dowry
 bas ek baar bharat china se aage nikal jaae phir uske baad last time meni times or first time voter vaala yuva bharat dahez ko dafana degaa
 Till give, till then you can only argue why our society which aspires to become the world guru loses from dowry
 aakhir kis bharatis samskruti ke tahat yah pratha aaj bhi ladakiyon ko garbh se lekar grih pravesh tak ke maukon par maar rahi he
 Where would the dowry society keep black money? swiss bank main rakhata hoga yaa baba ramdev ko bataa detaa hoga ki yahaan rakh diya he kisi se mat kahiega
 Ever is the best way
 aap sab jaanate hai ki dahez ke naam par vishwa guru banane vaale bharat main har ghante ek aurat kii hatya kar di jaati he
 The number of dowry cases has increased in the last several years
 is dahez ne paariwarik yatnaa ke itane rup paidaa kiye jisase hamaari filmon or siriyalon main saas or nanad ke kirdaar kaaphi samrudh ho gaye
 They mean that dowry is a family and social evil
 sab shaamil hote hai
 Can say both bride and groom side
 isse pehle ki aaj kii bahes ke kanoonee pahalu kii taraf pravesh karun aapako satya rani chaddha ke bare main bataata hum
 i did not even know
 livemint main namita bhandare kii ek report padhi jiske mutabik satya rani chadda is mangalvaar ko guzar gayi
 She was from Delhi
 assi ke dashak main dahez hatyaein badhati ja rahi thim
 The society was ignoring the kitchen as an accident
 1979 main satya rani chadda kii beti kii shaadi hoti he or das maheene main hi uski maut ho jaati he
 Her daughter, six months pregnant, was reportedly burnt by a stove burst
 adaalaton ke kai chakkar lagane ke saath satya rani chadda ne ise un maataaon ke liye bhi insaaf kii ladaai main badal diya jinaki betiyaan maar di gayi thim
 Shahjahan Apa comes with him in this fight
 unki bhi beti ke saath aisa hua tha
 One result of the activism of these two was that the government should add the harshest provisions in the dowry antagonism law that now the responsibility of proving charges will be on the husband and relatives of the husband
 yah or baat he ki satya rani chadda apni hi beti ko insaaf nahin dilaa sakin
 Subhash Gupta, who killed his daughter, was punished but he escaped
 aap jaanate hai ki 498-e kya he
 Many claim that it is being used to implicate husbands and their innocent relatives
 galat istamaal ke kilaaf ladaai bhi kuch kam lambii nahin he
 On Wednesday, the Supreme Court said that under Section 41 of the crpc, the right to arrest the police without warrant and order of magistrate is being misused
 police kisi aaropee ko naahak giraftaar na kare, na hi magistrate giraftaar ko adhikrut kare
 You know that as soon as a case of dowry harassment is registered under 498-A, the police arrest the same before gathering evidence
 pati ke saath exiaar main darj anya rishtedaar bhi pakad liye jate hai
 The Supreme Court has not only denied it wrong but has also told what the police will have to do immediately before arrest
 police ko santusht hona hoga ki giraftaar zaruri he yaa nahin
 Whether or not the case is made as per the instructions of section 41
 sabhi police afasaron ko section 411bi ke tahat check list die jaaenge
 The police officer will fill these and present the evidence to the magistrate
 magistrate is report ko dekhakar hi giraftaar ko adhikrut karegaa
 If the police does not arrest, then he will have to tell the magistrate within two weeks why not be arrested
 isse zyada vakt lag gaya to espi ko likhit taur par bataanaa hoga
 The accused will be asked to appear within two weeks of the registration of the case

 The city of Kolkata has always been popular
 tii-shart utarkar naachte saurav ganguli hon, yaa 'korbo lorbo jitabo re' chillaatishahrukh kii ipel team or yaa phir mohan bagan footbal club
 But apart from the sports world, the roots of this city extend to films
 haavda brij se lekar victoria memorial tak, in khubasurat lokations ne paryatakon ke saath film diarectaron kaa bhi dhyaan apni ore khinchaa he
 Kolkata is the motherland for many Bengali film makers like Ritwik Khatil, Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, Buddhadeb Dasgupta and Rituparno Ghosh
 lekin bharat main hindi film industry ke itihaas ko agar tatola jaae to aazaadee ke baad se hi kolkata limlite main aa gaya tha
 'do Bigha Zameen' in 1953, 'devdas' in 1955, 'pyaasa' in 1957, 'howrah Bridge' in 1958 and 1972 'amar Prem' gave many superstars to Bollywood
 matlab saaf tha, kolkata hindi cinema ke liye lucky tha
 This means that if the film was shot in Kolkata, then it would rock at the box office
 lekin kyon tamaam diarectors-producers shooting ke liye kolkata ko chunate hai? exparts kii najar se dekha jaae to:1
 The architecture, friendly people, pleasant and religious atmosphere, positive environment and the coolness of the Hooghly River attract artists
 2
 Apart from this, Kolkata and its surrounding areas are also very cheap to film
 bataaya jaataa he ki yahaan lebar bhi kaaphi sasta he
 3
 bengali logon ke khun main hi mujeec, cinema or arts ke liye pyaar basaa hua he, to wo film mekking ke dauraan madad karne ko bhi aasaani se taiyaar ho jate hai
 4
 sabase badi baat yah he ki aapako darjeeling ke pahaad shoot karne hon yaa digha kaa samundar - yahaan se sab najadik hi he
 So it is not heaven for shooting directors
 5
 The history of art and culture here is also very old
 theatre ho yaa litarechar-kolkata main aapaki research bahut aasaan ho jaati he
 6
 period filmon ke liye ek behtareen lokation he kolkata
 The Victorian buildings and street nooks here have not changed like the modern cities
 puraani samskruti kii asli chhap yahaan aasaani se dikhti he
 7
 local bengali logon ko film, naatak aadi se hameshaa se hi lagaav rahaa he
 This is the reason that supporting characters for any film are easily found here
 'ram teri ganga maili' se lekar 'do anjaane', 'parinita', 'yuva', 'vicky donor', 'kahani', 'barfi', 'lav aaj kal', 'gunde', 'badmaash company', 'kamine', 'luteraa' or 'bullate raja' tak darjanon filmein yahaan shoot gayi

 Dattu, who continues his struggle even in such a mental state, is a resident of Chandwad village near Nashik in Maharashtra
 nai pahal: apni selary se free main footbal sikhaa rahi bihar kii ye constebalpane sanyukt parivaar ke vibhaajan ke baad kathin paristhitiyon main padhai ke saath-saath unhone apane pita ke saath kaam kar parivaar kaa paalan-poshan kiya
 However, after his father's death, the difficulties of life for him increased
 apane parivaar ke sabase bade bete dattu us vakt paanchavin kaksha main the, jab unhone apane pita ke saath dainik majdoor banakar kamai karne kaa faisla liya
 He is survived by his ailing mother and two younger brothers
 apane pita ke nidhan ke baad vah bhartiya sena main bhartee ho gaye or yahaan se dattu ke jivan kaa nayaa safar shuru hua, jo unhen asian khelon kii is uplabdhi tak lekar gaya
 Dattu told IANS, 'I was in fifth grade in 2004-05, when my joint family split
 iske baad ham do vakt kii roti bhi nahin juta paa rahe the or tab maine apane pita ke saath kaam karne kaa faisla liya
 My father used to dig wells
 bakaul dattu, maine apni padhai jari rakhi or kai tarah ke kaam kiye
 Waiter at weddings, farming, tractor driving etc
 saal 2007 main dattu ne skool chhodkar petrol pump par kaam karnaa shuru kar diya
 Four years later, his father passed away in December 2011
 unhone kaha, mujhe har maah 3,000 rupee mehtaanaa miltaa tha
 Work with his father used to fetch bread for two times, but after his death all the responsibility of the family fell on me
 pita kii he juute kii dukaan, bete ne 5 hajaar main khadi kar di companydattu ne 2010 main phir se skool janaa shuru kar diya
 He used to work at the petrol pump at night
 2012 main sena main bhartee hone ke baad unke jivan kaa nayaa safar shuru hua
 Dattu, a 27-year-old resident of Maharashtra, said he had decided to join the army for the upbringing of his family
 unhone kaha, apane pita ke nidhan ke teen maah baad main bhartee ho gaya
 My mother's health was also poor and this was my biggest concern
 hamaare parivaar main bhale hi khaanaa puraa nahin tha lekin pyaar or lagaav bharpoor tha
 Dattu used to run from school to arrive at the petrol pump on time and this helped him to join the army
 kaam ke saath apni padhai ko jari rakh vah kisi tarah 10veen kaksha main 52 pratishat ankon ke saath paas ho gaye
 Dattu defeated the fear of water and started sailing training under the guidance of his coach
 2013 main unhen sena ke rowing node (earen) main shaamil kar liya gaya
 After six months of training in Pune, he won two gold medals at the National Championship and his confidence grew from here
 saal 2014 main inchion main hue asian khelon main bhi unhen chunaa gaya lekin paristhitiyaan unki ummid ke mutabik nahin rahi
 For the first time at the international level, she fainted due to pressure of performance and after that she was injured
 unke jivan kii sabase badi chunauti 2016 main unke saamne ai, jab ek durghatana kaa shikaar hokar unki maa coma main chali gayi
 Dattu also took part in the Rio Olympics in this difficult time
 indonesia main hue asian khelon main dattu ne kwadrapal scal spardhaa kaa swarna apane naam kiya
 Describing this happiness, he said, "I had a 106 degree fever during the finals, but i was inspired from within
" itani badi uplabdhi hasil karne ke baavjood apni jameen se jude dattu is baat ko sweekaar karne se nahin hichkichaate hai ki unke paas apana ghar nahin he
 He still lives with his younger brothers despite winning gold representing India at the Asian Games
 aakhir sarkaar kii niyat par log shaq kyon na karen? desh jab kaale dhan par kudh rahaa ho tab aisa vidheyak loksabhaa main pesh kiya gaya he jo videsh main avaidh paisa rakhane waalon ko kanoonee sakhti se pehle tex or penalty dekar batch nikalne kaa mauka dene ja rahaa he
 Admittedly, the failure to bring in black money from abroad is making the government of Modi poor, but what is so vain that efforts to stop black money cannot be discussed in Parliament adequately
 videsh main jamaa kaala dhan par sakhti ke liye beete saptaah loksabhaa main pesh vidheyak (andisclosed fahrren inakam and esets bill 2015) darasal mani bill he, jis par desh main to chhodifee, sansad main bhi paryaapt bahes nahin hogi, kyonki ise sansadeey samitiyon ko bhi nahin diya ja saktaa
 What can be the motive for such haste and expulsion? After reading the Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets (UFIA) Bill 2015, even a general tax expert will tell that it is not a visionary or unsurpassed law
 agar videsh main jamaa aghoshit sampatti par sakhti kerani thi to iske liye nayaa kanoon ladane kii jarurat shaayad nahin thi
 The new laws are the hallmark of maximum governance that increases the risk of abuse
 videsh main jamaa kaale dhan par shikanje ke liye maujuuda iskar kanoon main kuch sanshodhan ho sakate the kyonki videshi sampatti sahit kar yogya sampatti chhipaane par saat saal kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan pehle se maujuud he
 The new bill is equipped with confiscation of property in India, strict punishment and limiting the way of legal defense if found guilty of hiding money abroad
 ye praavdhaan maujuuda iskar kanoon main jode ja sakate the
 What was the need to bring a new law in a hurry only for this? More than surprising the provisions of this bill are on the way of bringing it and the strategy of getting it passed
 yah vidheyak ek mani bill he jise samvidhan kii dhara 117 or 274 ke tahat pesh kiya gaya he
 Under Section 117, special money bills are introduced by giving prior notice to the President
 yah rajyasabha bhi nahin jayega, jahaan sarkaar alpamat main he
 Being a money bill, it does not even need to be sent to parliamentary committees but Lok Sabha will have to pass it in 75 days
 videsh main kaale dhan ke khaaton par sakhti ke kanoon ko lekar yah peshbandi bataati he ki is par bahes ko simit rakhane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The sixth clause of this bill will be disputed and will be seen in light of preventing debate
 is khand ke tahat vyavastha di gai he ki is nae kanoon ke prabhavi hone se pehle agar videsh main chipaaya dhan ghoshit karte hue tex (30 fisad) or penalty (tex kaa shat pratishat) chukaai jaati he to karrwai nahin hogi
 When they meet the lawyers, they will also doubt the provision of pardon on the basis of the experience of 1997 VDIS scheme, saying that companies rarely come to declare black money under this law
 vajah? vidiies main gopneeyata ke vaade ke baavjood kai maamalon main kar jaanch shuru hui thi
 This new law also does not clarify the fact that if the black money comes out of the gyaram, then the action will be taken against the declarer
 phir bhi videsh main jamaa kaala dhan dhone ke liye yah landry nuksaan kaa sauda nahin he
 Keeping money in a tax haven gets one or two percent interest, dozens of risks separately
 is nai vyavastha main kar or penalty chukaane ke baad bhi 100 ru
 40 out of Rs
 bachenge jo saaf-suthere honge
 There is bound to be a dispute over granting amnesty because it is an injustice to honest taxpayers to get the opportunity to evade tax evaders
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki sarkaar is vidheyak par badi bahes nahin chaahati, bas kisi tarah sansad kii dahalij paar kara dena chaahati he taaki kuch kaala dhan waapas laakar dikhaaya ja sake or ek ataarkik chunavi vaade se mukarne kii kaalikh kam kii ja sake
 In a country where rapists are not punished despite strict laws, there is no guarantee that half-incomplete laws will be effective on black money stashed abroad
 iskar, seemaa or utpaada shulk ke lambit abhiyojanon kaa itihaas bataata he ki tex prashasan kitna boda he
 To say that the Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2012 is also strict but till now neither a big case has been made nor there is a big recovery
 isliye nayaa kathith sakht kanoon sirf ek nae inspector raaj kaa khatra paidaa karata he jaisaa ki is prajati ke duusare kanoonon main he jo sajaa to nahin dilaa pate alabatta bhrashtachar ke nakhun paine kar dete hai
 After studying the law carefully, there are many technical weaknesses in it which do not prove to be suitable for liberal economy and transparency
 ise vyaavhaarik banane ke liye desh or sansad main is par paryaapt bahes har tarah se jaruri he
 Black money stored abroad is not even half a percent of the black economy
 is mudde par chunavi or nyaayik sakriyata ke baad kaale dhan kii paidaavaar ko simit karne, khapat ke taur-tareekon ko rokane, desh se baahar laane-le jane ke raaston or raajnneetik chande sahit vibhinn ayaamon par samgr prayaason kii apeksha kii gai thi
 There was no expectation from the government that the window of prevention of black money would be restricted to foreign accounts, opening a window of escape for those possessing black money abroad and imposing a law equipped with Inspector Raj
 sarkarein aksar yah bhul jaati hai ki aam log niyat padhgaye main chook nahin karte
 It is not decided how much black money deposited abroad will come through this law
 alabatta isamen koi shaq nahin ki iske praavdhaan or ise laane kaa tarika, kaale dhan ko lekar sarkaar kii niyat par uthne vaale sawaalon ko bada or painaa jarur kar denge

 karnataka ke mukhyamantri echdi kumaraswami ne rajya ke film distributors se kaha he ki vah rajnikant kii film relies na karen
 Describing the distributors as being from Karnataka, he said- 'do not release Rajinikanth's film' Kaala 'in such an environment
 bataa den ki ek din pehle hi vitarakon ke bain lagane ke faisle ko karnataka hoicourt ne khaarij kar diya tha
 Ban on Kala, removed in Karnataka, was a loss of 20 crores
 What else did Asakumar Kumaraswamy say? In a press conference, Kumaraswamy said, "as a state government, i have to follow the directions of the High Court and i will take care of it
 yah meri jimmedaari bhi he
 We have to follow the directions of the High Court
 ' kumaraswami ne kaha, 'ek mukhyamantri ke rup main nahin balki ek vyakti ke taur par ek karnatakavasi ke taur par main is film ke produsar or vitarakon se is maahaul main film relies nahin karne kaa aagrah karata hum
 'what did Rajinikanth say? After this statement by HD Kumaraswamy, Rajinikanth also issued a statement
 is bayaan main unhone kaha, 'main echdi kumaraswami kii sthiti ko samajhataa hum
 This is not good for Karnataka
 jab meri film duniyabar main relies ho rahi he, to karnataka main film par bain kaveri jal vivaad mudde ko hi hilite karegaa
 Rajinikanth also appealed to the state film Chambers in Kannada
 unhone film ko relies hone kii apil kii
 Rajinikanth said- 'the Film Chamber has to ensure that there are no problems for the distributors
 yah sahi nahin he ki karnataka film chembar kaala par bain kii maang kare
 Faced with 'rajinikanth's' Kala', the IT company also announced a holiday that Kannada-backed groups in the state had warned to stop the release of 'kala' on Rajinikanth's recent remarks on the Cauvery dispute
 karnataka main film se jude ek sanghathan ne kaala par bain lagane kii bhi ghoshnaa kii thi

 Why is Kala being demanded to be banned in Karnataka? His performance in Karnataka was banned following a statement by Rajinikanth in the Cauvery controversy
 rajnikant ne kaha tha, kaveri nadi se tamilnadu ko milane vaale pani kii maatra ko kam karne kaa supreme court kaa aadesh niraashajanak he
 The state government should file a review petition
 iske baad KFCC (karnataka film chember of commers) ne rajya main film ko bain kar diya he
 The 10 groups also demanded the Kannada Film Council to ban the film, as they were dissatisfied with Rajinikanth's statements in the Cauvery case
