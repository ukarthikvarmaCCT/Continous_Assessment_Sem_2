 achyutanandan pamaranu virdohi pradarshnakariyon ke saath ekajutata dikhaane ke liye kudankulam jane vaale the
 As soon as the CPI (M) leader's car reached the border town, it was stopped by a Tamil Nadu police officer and requested the 88-year-old leader not to go further citing security reasons
 achyutanandan ne yah anurodh maan liya
 He said he was disappointed at not being able to go to the coastal village of Tamil Nadu to show solidarity with the anti-nuclear protesters but did not want to create a law and order problem for the neighboring state

 Achuthanandan, however, said that he strongly believes that nuclear plants are dangerous
 unhone kaha ki unki party ne bharat america asainya parmaanu samjhaute ke virodh main samprag sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya tha
 Taking a dig at the party leadership, Achuthanandan said, 'I have not changed my mind since then

 bhavari ko acchhee tarah pataa tha ki yah sidi logon ke saamne ai to uski jaan ko khatra ho saktaa he
 In a taped telephone conversation, which mysteriously went public on November 4 this year, Bhanwari can be heard saying, "both cds are in Ajmer's locker

 On November 10, parts of it aired on some local TV channels
 49 minute kii yah sidi bhavari or maderna ke ek-duusare ke kapade utaarne ke saath shuru hoti he
 Maderna's whisper is captured in the camera as well, in which he says in Bhanwari's ear, using the plural in royal style, "we love you
" ''bhavari ko pataa tha ki gupt camera kahaan rakhaa gaya he
 So when it comes her undress, she turns away from the camera
 sidi ke zyaadaatar hisse main uski peeth hi dikhaai detii he yaa vah bistar par apane hisse main leti hui dikhaai detii he

 "his claim was correct
 bhavari kii sabase ghaatak galati yah thi ki usne sidi ko sabase zyada paisa dene vaale ko nilaam karne kii koshish kii
 Three telephonic conversations reveal that while she was using Sohanlal as a middleman between Maderna and herself, she also asked her to contact a party in Delhi
 jaahiri taur par maderna vah sidi kharidne ke liye taiyaar ho gaye the
 In this conversation, Sohanlal can be heard saying to Bhanwari, "I have spoken to Maderna and they are ready to pay
" ''bhavari saavdhaan karti he, ''agar ve samajhaita ke liye taiyaar hai to donon sidi unhen saunp duungi, nahin to ek, do, teen kai pratiyaan bana duungi
 "it is clear from this conversation that if Maderna refuses to give money, there is a danger of the CD being exposed
" yahi vah dhamkee he, jo jodhpur ke paas borunda kii sahaayak nurse ke liye ulti pad gai
 19 October 2011: See India Today in pictures 12 October 2011: Look at pictures India Today 5 October 2011: Look at pictures India Today If Bhanwari is dead, who killed her? Who leaked three CD and telephone conversations within a few days? Is there an attempt to smuggle some at the highest political level in Jaipur? These questions are now echoing outside Gehlot's Rajasthan
 agar gahalot ne bhavari ke gaayab hone ke turant baad maderna ko istipha dene ke liye kah diya hota to ve is sex scandle ke dushprinaamon ko roak sakate the
 During the police investigation, Maderna's name had surfaced and everyone knew about his relationship with Bhanwari

 '' vah apni tii-shart, jis par plabvoy kaa janaa-pahachaanaa khargosh chapa hua he, kii aasteen se bhun pochhata he
 According to Amar Chand, his wife told him that she was going to Bilara to meet Sohanlal
 amar chand kehete hai, ''vah (sohanlal) pichley do saal se hamaare yahaan aata-jaataa tha
 
 pichhali baar vah 27 agast ko aayaa tha or meri patni ne use raakhi baandhi thi
 According to Sohan's statement given to the police and the information of Bhanwari disclosed to her husband, Sohanlal got his two-year old diesel Swift car 4

 This was his last conversation with his wife
 jab vah shaam 6
 Amar Chand called her again when she did not return home by 30 pm
 ve kehete hai, ''meri patni kaa mobile band tha
 Then he called Sohanlal and told him that Bablu (bhanwari used to call him by the same name in the house) did not meet him
 raat 9 baje amar chand ko chintaa hui or ve khud sohanlal ke ghar gaye
 He says, "his wife said he has gone out
" ''ab amar chintit ho uthe

 He says, "I called Sohanlal again and said that Bablu has not returned home yet
" usne mujhase poocha, 'koi jat koi kaam to nahin karai die ho
 (are you sure that no Jat killed him?) "on September 4, two days later, Inspector General of Police Umesh Mishra came to Birla and started investigating Bhanwari's disappearance
 india today kii or khabaron ko padhane ke liye clic karen5 sitambar ko bhavari ke apharan ke maamle main exiar, jiskaa number 383-11 tha, darj karke sohanlal ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 There was no mention of Maderna in it
 police sutron ke mutabik, poochtacha ke dauraan sohanlal ne kaha ki usne bhavari ko shahabuddin ke hawaale kar diya
 Bhanwari apparently knew Shahabuddin as Raju Bhaiya
 sohanlal kaa kahana tha ki bhavari shahabuddin ke bolero main uske or driver ke saath gai
 According to Sohanlal, he had seen Bhanwari for the last time
 shahabuddin kaa daawa he ki usne bhavari ko ek scorpiyo main kuch logon ko saunp diya tha
 According to a police source, she said that she knew those people and wanted to go back to Borunda with them
 '' jaanch yaheen aakar thahar gai
 There was no attempt to connect the various links and to know who Sohanlal had given Bhanwari to Shahabuddin at the behest of him
 maje kii baat he ki sohanlal ke maderna se achche sambandh hai
 He is a contractor in the Department of Public Health and Engineering
 maderna haal tak isi vibhaag ke mantri the
 Initially, Maderna said that he did not know Bhanwari
 lekin jab sidi kaa khulaasa hua to unhone sachaai kabool kar lee
 He told the CBI that he had a relationship with Bhanwari, but he had no hand in her disappearance
 11 november ko sibiai kii poochtacha ke baad unki patni lila maderna kaa jawaab tha, ''kisi ke saath prem sambandh rakhana or uski sidi bananaa koi jurm nahin he
 But his eye-catching designer glasses concealed his heartfelt feelings
 aise main tajjub nahin ki 14 november ko rajasthan hycourt kii jodhpur peeth ne jaanch main dhilaai baratane ke liye sibiai kii khinchaai kii
 Additional advocate general in Jodhpur Anand Purohit says, "the CBI had demanded four weeks, but the court asked them to provide information about Bhanwari's whereabouts within 10 days
" 
 
 aaj tak uski hatya kaa koi saboot nahin mila he
 The police is cooperating with the CBI
 '' adaalat ne sibiai ko yah bhi chetavanee di ki is maamle kaa hashr dilli ke upnagar noida main aarushi talwaar hatya ke maamle jaisaa na ho jaae
 The CBI has questioned Maderna twice and Malkhan three times
 poochtacha ke dauraan sibiai ne donon ko aamane-saamne bhi milaayaa, kyonki maderna kaa kahana tha ki malakhan ne hi bhavari ko unase milwaaya tha
 At first Malkhan denied it, but later agreed
 malakhan kii bahan indira bishnoi, jo bhavari kii kareebi thim, ne 7 november ko bataaya ki bhavari pichley saal gahalot se mili thi or unhen sidi ke bare main bataaya tha
 Gehlot has never insisted and denied this
 is aarope par unki pratikriya thi, ''main har roj kai logon se miltaa hum
 i can't remember who met me and who didn't
 lekin yah mere liye khabar he ki bhavari ne mujhe maderna se sambandhit video tepe ke bare main bataaya
 Local Congress workers point out that during the first six months of Gehlot becoming Chief Minister in December 2008, Maderna missed no opportunity to oppose the Chief Minister
 lekin saal bhar baad achaanak badlaav aa gaya or maderna mukhyamantri kii har baat maanane lage
 "perhaps Gehlot intimidated him by threatening to make the CD public," says a Congress MLA
 ''2003 main kisi samay malakhan ne bhavari ko maderna se milwaaya tha, kyonki vah apni ek mitra kaa tabadalaa karana chaahati thi
 Then, in the greed to get political contact, an assistant nurse went on a dangerous path
 aisi khabaren bhi hai ki bhavari ke sambandh duusare raajnneetikon se bhi the, lekin maderna or malakhan ke alaava kisi or kaa naam saamne nahin aayaa he
 Amar Chand says that he knew only two people: "no woman tells her husband about these things
" mujhe uske phone se hone vaali baatcheet se andeh tha ki uske sambandh in donon (maderna or malakhan) se hai
 There are also rumors that one of her children was actually born due to a relationship with Malkhan and Bhanwri was keen to undergo a DNA test
 amar chand kehete hai, ''bachche mere hai
 i can say this myself
 '' lekin isse afvaahen thamane vaali nahin hai
 a local businessman claims that Bhanwari created a spectacle there during the marriage of Malkhan's daughter
 vah kah rahi thi ki uski ek beti, jise vah malakhan se paidaa hui bataa rahi thi, ko baraabar kaa haq milanaa chahie
 If local rumors are to be believed, there have been many such incidents, one of which happened at the Hero Honda showroom in Malkhan in Jodhpur last year
 ek sthaneey vyapaaree kehete hai, ''bhavari or malakhan ko pati-patni ke rup main dekha jaataa tha
 Maderna and Bhanwari were never seen together in public
 ''borunda main bhavari ke ghar main ast-vyast rup main paise kaa asar dekha ja saktaa he

 "she wrote in the FIR that she had gone home" wearing a brown designer saree
 ''bhavari kaa jhtka dilli tak pahunch gaya he
 Gehlot had gone to Delhi at least thrice within three weeks before the CD was released on TV

 '' maderna parivaar kaa prabhaav haalanki jodhpur ke kuch jatbahul ilaakon tak hi simit he, lekin yah pehla sex ghotaalaa he, jisane rajasthan ko hilaakar rakh diya he
 The Gehlot government has been accused of corruption and incompetence, but now illegal connections have been added to this list
 yah akelaa sex ghotaalaa nahin he
 a local newspaper, in its report dated 29 September, described another cabinet minister Ramlal Jat as involved in such a case
 us report main khulaasa kiya gaya he ki jat kii ek mahila mitra paras devi ne 27 sitambar ko aatmahatya kar lee thi
 The Jats were at that time holding a district council meeting in their constituency in Bhilwara
 ve bhagkar aspataal pahunche or usee raat shav kaa postmortem karaane kaa dawaab daalane lage
 When he was told that the post-mortem would take place the next day, he took the corpse to another hospital but had to return due to lack of doctors
 postmortem main koi bhi sandigdh baat saamne nahin ai
 But the viscera report is still awaited

 shanivaar ko modi ne lalu kii beti rohinee yadav kii benami sampatti ke khulaase kaa daawa kiya
 Modi said that Rohini Acharya has a stake in Patna's GV Mall
 ye vahi mal he jisamen shanivaar subah bhayankar aag lagi thi
 The property worth crores was burnt down in the fire
 'laaparvaahee se lagi aag'susheel modi kii maane to jivi mal main lagi aag builder kii laaparvaahee kaa nateeja he
 The mall is named after the domineering leader of RJD, Praveen Kumar

 'rasookh ke chalate tode niyam'susheel modi kii maane to praveen kumaar ne apane rasookh ke chalate mal ke nirmaan main niyamon kii dhajjiyaan udaayi
 Therefore, there were no arrangements to deal with the fire inside the building
 modi kaa daawa he ki mal ke bheetar aag bujhane ke upkaran bhi kaam nahin kar rahe the
 There is a petrol pump next to the mall and if the fire had spread here, this accident could have caused more devastation
 susheel modi kii maang thi ki praveen kumaar ke khilaaf is maamle main exiaar darj honi chahie
 'selling price for a penny' says Sushil Modi that Praveen Kumar sold the 983-square-foot property inside the mall to Rohini Acharya three years ago to please Lalu Yadav
 is property kii keemat kareeb 96 lakh rupaye thi
 But Praveen sold it for just 59 lakhs

 jis express-ve par sukhoi or miraj jaise ladaaku vimaan utarate hon, us par gaadi daudane kaa anand kya hoga
 This question has been in the minds of many people since they saw Akhilesh Yadav inaugurating the agra-lucknow Expressway a month ago
 lekin ye charchit express-ve udghaatan ke samay logon ke liye nahin kholaa gaya tha
 This highway opened to the general public on Friday
 akhilesh yadav sarkaar kaa daawa he ki is express-ve se aap agra se lakhanu kii duuri sirf 4 ghante main puri kar sakate hai
 But after Aaj Tak went and took stock of the situation after the express was opened to the general public, the truth was seen something else
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki jo hisse banakar taiyaar ho gaye hai vahaan par yah express-ve shandaar dikhti he
 But after leaving Lucknow a few kilometers ahead, it is understood that express-veko has been opened in a hurry in the run-up to the election
 zyaadaatar hisson main sadak sirf ek taraf hi ban kar taiyaar hui he
 Work is going on on the other side
 vaayade ke mutabik, kai jagahon par dial 100 police kii gaadiyaan or ambulace to dikhe lekin pehle hi din accident kii shikaar gadiyaan bhi dikhin
 Street light is not known anywhere

 While walking, the road suddenly ends and the vehicles that make the road in front start appearing
 sadak ke donon taraf mitti kaa kaam abhi bhi ho rahaa he isiilie dhul kaa gubaar kai jagah dikhataa he
 If the other train is coming from the front of the train going fast on the expressway, the result can be dangerous if not visible in front of the dust
 aas-paas vaalen gaanv bhi pareshansadak ke donon taraf lagane vaali railing bhi abhi lagaana baaki he jisaki vajah se bich express-ve par jaanavar ghoomte dikhe
 The villages on the banks of the expressway are different
 jaahidpur gaanv ke log sadak par khadey hai kyonki sadak banane main unke gaanv kii jameen to chali gai lekin express ve par aane ke liye unhen koi rasta nahin diya gaya he
 Pradeep Chauhan, who came on the expressway on the first day, also had no good experience
 unhone kaha ki express par dekhne ke liye vah aa to gaye lekin is par chalanaa bhi khatarnaak he kyonki bahut kaam hona baaki he
 Inspectors patrolling the expressway tell themselves that a lot of work is yet to be done, but people are driving cars at high speed which can be dangerous
 pehle din express se kii haalat dekh kar yah lagata he ki agar aap sahi salaamat is par safar karnaa chaahate hai to aapako kuch maheenon kaa intjaar karnaa chahie

 On Monday, Bangladesh Cricket Team manager Khalid Mehmood resigned from the post citing family reasons before the only Test against India starting on Wednesday
 bangladesh ke ek pramukh dainiksamachar patr ‘prothom aalo’ne bangladesh cricket board ke sutron ke hawaale se kaha ki mahmud ne apana istipha bisibi ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari nizamuddin choudhary ko ravivaar ko email se bheja
 Naimur Rahman, head of BCB Cricket Operations Committee, has declined to comment on the matter
 unhone kaha ki is mudde par mahmud ke saath charchaa kii jaaegi
 Former Bangladeshi cricketer Mahmood was a medium pacer and middle-order batsman
 unhone 1998 se 2006 tak team kaa pratinidhitiv kiya or2003 se 2004tak team kii aguai bhi kii
 Input IANS in dinon main soshal media ke vibhinn plateform par ek bank kii muhar lagi passbook kaa photo viral ho rahaa he, jisamen yah likhaa he ki bank main aapaki jamaa main se sirf ek lakh rupye tak kii raashi hi bimit he
 That is, if the bank sinks, you will get back only one lakh rupees from your entire deposit
 yah photo sahi he yaa nahin isapar bahes karne se pehle yah jaananaa jaruri he ki jo jaankaree iske sahare viral kii ja rahi he vah darasal bilkul sahi he
 The insurance given by banks by Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) is up to an amount of up to one lakh rupees
 yah niyam, bank kii loker main rakhi sampatti, saavadhi jamaa yani epady, bachat khate main jamaa paisa aadi sab par samaan rup se lagu hota he
 DICGC is a subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India
 aise samay main jab piemasi bank sawaalon ke ghere main he tab kahin na kahin har bank khatadharak ke man main yah sawaal kulbula rahaa he ki kya meraa paisa bank main surakshit he?yah baat bhi dhyaan rakhni chahie ki bharat main ajtak kisi bhi bade nijee yaa saarvajanik bank ne difolt nahin kiya he
 The structure and functioning of co-operative institutions is always under question due to lack of transparency
 notebandi ke dauraan bhi ko-operative bank kii ore dhaandhlee kii khabaren charchaa main thim
 If no big bank has defaulted in India till date, the credit goes to two people
 pehla arabiai jaise sakht niamak or doosraa karodon deshavaasiyon, jinaki aadat main bachat karnaa shumaar he
 Banks in India are able to trade due to their deposits
 aise samay main jab desh main karodon back khaataa dharakon main bharose kii kami he to kya sarkaar ko jamakartaon kii himmat baandhne ke liye bimit jamaa raashi kii seemaa nahin badhaani chahie
 The last increase was 23 years 6 months ago in May 1993
 shuruyaat 1961 main 1
 5 thousand rupees
 iske baad 1968 main is seemaa ko badhaakar 5 hajaar, 1970 main 10 hajaar, 1976 main 20 hajaar, 1980 main 30 hajaar kiya gaya tha
 Since 1993, inflation has risen by more than 470 per cent
 yani 1993 main 100 rupye aaj 570 rupye ke kareeb ho chuke hai
 So why should not increase the sum insured from 1 lakh to 5 to 6 lakhs
 desh main bank doobane kii khabaren aam nahin he
 In such a situation it may or may not affect the health of the government or the bank, but this step will definitely work to arouse confidence in the general public
 wo bhi aise samay par jab desh main bachat dashakon ke nichle str par he
 RBI, Bank and DICGC jointly take a decision so that the public can be encouraged

 Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan, while reviewing monetary policy, surprised everyone by cutting interest rates by 50 basis points on September 29
 unka yah faisla unki chhavi ke ulat tha
 The question arises, what does this reduction in interest rates mean for the economy? This may have led to some jump in the bank's loan account
 kareeb chah maah se yah 10 fisadi ke neeche mandara rahaa he
 Rajan also raised some basic issues that make the Indian economy fragile in times of global instability
 lihaaja, unhone bharat kii sambhavit vikaas dar ko purvavarti 7
 7 minus 6 percent
 4 fisadi kar daalaa he
 Pranab Sen of the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation says that India's interest rates are among the highest in the world
 ise apekshit staron par laana, jo jaankaron ke mutabik 2
 Anything between 5 and 4 per cent can be done, demanding a 400 basis point deduction which is almost impossible
 rajan zyada se zyada 50 aadhaar ank kii katautee kar sakate the par jaruri nahin ki bank iskaa laabh apane graahakon ko pahunchaaen
 Interest rate cuts may have an impact just in terms of perception
 ab gend sarkaar ke paale main he
 It will have to ensure the proliferation of this step and, according to the Crisil report, adopt a "path of expenditure in terms of treasury"
 bharat kii rajkoshiya niti aisi ho jo gharelu maang badha sake, gramin arthvyavastha or krishi sambandhi chintaaon ko sambodhit kar sake tathaa kaarobaar ke maamle main desh ko pratispardhi bana sake
 These challenges seem frightening

 shrivastav kehete hai, “vaishvik arthvyavastha kii kamajori hamaari arthvyavastha ko bhi kamjor rakhegi
 “the slowdown in emerging economies, including China, may slow down global growth
 agast main china ne dollar ke mukaable apni mudra kaa 4
 4 per cent devaluation, which is prone to waging a monetary war
 so, bhartiya niryaatak bhi rupye ko or kamjor karne ke liye sarkaar ko hastkshep karne kah rahe hai
 At the same time when Rajan cut interest rates, the US Federal Reserve decided to maintain the status quo at zero interest rate
 yah faisla bhi vaishvik arthvyavastha se judi chintaaon ke kaaran hi liya gaya
 The current slowdown in the global economy is reminiscent of the 2008 recession
 arthshaastri is baar kii sthiti ke liye shsecular gatirodhya jaisaa shabd prayog kar rahe hai
 This means a long period of sluggish growth
 is baar sankat china se paidaa ho rahaa he
 Srivastava points out that the crisis is related to higher levels of non-financial debt, especially government debt
 bank for international setlements (biies) kii taaja vijyapti ke anusaar philhal kul karj anupaat 2007 ke adhiktam str ke mukaable kaaphi zyada he
 In emerging market economies, government and private debt combined has come to 167 per cent of GDP, a 50 per cent increase
 biies ke mutabik, ateet main itane bade paimaane par karj main vruddhi ke baad koi na koi bada vittiya sankat jarur aayaa he
 The Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported India's projected growth of 7 in fiscal year 2016
 3 fisadi par rakhaa he
 According to this, if India has to increase by 7 percent, then both government and private demand will have to increase by 12 percent
 philhal sarkari maang 2-3 fisadi he jabaki nijee nivesh kii maang bhi 5-6 fisadi ke kamjor str par he
 In a recent study by RBI, there has been talk of a continuous narrowing of capital expenditure since the financial year 2012
 isane yah bhi dikhaaya tha ki 2016 main niojit nivesh kareeb khatm ho chukaa he
 There are only two ways to stimulate demand
 ek yah he ki sarkaar puunjigat vyay ko tarjeeh de or use tikaae rakhe
 The second monetary measure is the reduction in interest rates
 sarkaar ke saamne ek badi dikkat yah he ki uski udhaar lene kii ek seemaa he, kyonki use apane vittiya ghate kaa lakshya bhi puraa karnaa he
 Moreover, it cannot increase or cut expenditure as most are already fixed
 kareeb 80 fisadi rajasav vyay vetan, pension or byaaj bhugtan kii mad main tay he
 Even if the government increases its expenditure, it will be difficult to sustain it
 agle teen saal duniya kii arthvyavastha aise hi sust rahegi
 This will not only affect India's exports, but will also affect the Make in India campaign
 china jaise deshon ke paas viksit kshamta he, so zyada sambhaavna he ki ve bharat main hi apni bikri badhayenge
 On the other hand, manufacturing in India accounts for just 13 per cent of GDP
 sarkaar kii praathamikta desh kii ladkadaati hui gramin arthvyavastha ke liye ek samgr niti taiyaar karne kii honi chahie
 According to economists, this is a good time to pursue cooperative federalism
 iske tahat rajyon ko bazaar se sakal rajya gharelu utpaada (jiesdipi) ke nirdhaarit teen fisadi se zyada udhari lene kii chhot di ja sakati he
 At the same time, states will have to try to spend more on infrastructure
 saarvajanik upkram or kendriya upkram is dauraan apana vistaar kar sakate hai
 Srivastava says, "maybe such measures encourage private investment
 ” crisil main mukhya arthshaastri di
 K
 joshi kehete hai, “sarkaar bas itnaa kar sakati he ki kaarobaar karnaa sahaj banaati jaae kyonki byaaj daren to vruddhi main maamuli sahyog hi de sakati hai
 Fiscal expenditure will also require cooperation

 2015 main lalu ne nitish se haath mila liya, or manorama ek baar phir emelsi ban gayi
 It is clear that both Bindi RJD and JD (U) felt useful

 After all, Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the Mumbai attacks, announced to contest elections in Pakistan next year
 jamaat-ud-daawa ke mukhiya hafiz ne shanivaar ko elaan kiya ki pakistan main agle saal hone vaala assembly chunaav vah ladega
 Talking to reporters here, this terrorist said that he will contest from the Milli Muslim League (MML) party
 haalanki usne abhi yah khulaasa nahin kiya ki vah kahaan se chunaav ladega
 Milli is the president of the Muslim League Party, Saifullahafiz formed the 'milli Muslim League' party in August itself
 usne jamaat-ud-daawa ke hi puraane sadsy safulla khalid ko party kaa adhyaksh niyukt kiya he
 a few months ago, Hafiz filed an application on behalf of his organization jamaat-ud-dawa to recognize the politics party in the name of 'milli Muslim League' in Pakistan Election Commission
 party gathan ke dauraan hi hafiz ne kaha tha ki wo kashmir kaa mudda purajor tareeke se uthayega
 Hafiz was under house arrest for 10 months, on 31 January 2017, Hafiz was under house arrest
 takreeban 10 maheene kii najarbandi ke baad 24 november ko use reeha kar diya gaya tha
 Defense expert Major General Ashok Kumar Mehta aajtak

 Mehta said that Operation All Out of the Indian Army has created panic among the terrorists
 isi ke chalate pakistan sarkaar or vahaan kii khufia agency ISI ne aatankiyon kaa hausala badhaane ke liye aatanki hafiz said kii rihaai kii he
 Major General Mehta, who was under house arrest for throwing dust into the eyes of the world, said that Hafiz Saeed's detention in Pakistan was a mere pretense
 pakistan sarkaar ne duniya kii ankhon main dhul jhonkneke liye yah kadam uthaaya tha
 Mehta said that if the Pakistan government had in fact been willing to take action against Hafiz Saeed, he would have been convicted in any case, including the Mumbai terror attack till now
 ab jab kashmir main lashkar-e-taiyaba ke pair ukhdane lage hai, to pakistani sena or ISI ne hafiz said ko reeha karne kaa daanv chalaa he
 As soon as he was released from house arrest, the manner in which Hafiz Saeed spewed poison against Kashmir raga and India, his intentions are clear
 pok main aatanki camp or lonching pad kaa daura karegaa hafijakhufia sutron kii maane to hafiz said ab pok main chal rahe aatanki camp or lonching pad kaa daura karegaa
 The Pakistani Army and ISI have instructed him for this
 jammu-kashmir main dehshatgardi ko badhaava dene ke liye trend aatankiyon kaa brainwash karne kii taiyaari he
 Terrorists have also gathered on the launching pad
 isse pehle pichley ek saal main kashmir ghati main 195 aatanki maare ja chuke hai, jisamen se 51 lashkar ke aatanki hai
 Article 370 should not be debated
 The General (retd) Mehta said that now is the best chance to establish peace in the valley through dialogue
 iske liye raajnneetik str par pahal kii jaani chahie or rajya va centre sarkaar ko milakar kadam uthaanaa chahie
 He said that just by appointing Dineshwar Sharma as the interlocutor and then taking a report in four months, the situation in the valley is not going to improve
 ghati main sthaayee shanti ke liye anuchhed 370 ko bina kisi bahes ke khatm kar dena chahie
 Also, terrorists should be completely eliminated and social media should be controlled
 iske alaava jammu-kashmir ke gusse ko kam karne ke liye AFSPA main bhi dhilaai deni chahie
 In the Lok Sabha election riots of Delhi, BJP does not want to leave any core
 bijepi ne akali dal ke saath press conferes karke unke saath-saath hone kaa massej diya he taaki sikh voters kaa dhruvikaran naa ho sake
 In many areas of Delhi, there is a large population of Sikh voters, in such a situation the motive of BJP and Akali alliance is clear
 wo adhik se adhik sikh votaron ko apni taraf aakarshith karne main lage hai
 In fact, Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal formed the SIT on the Chaurasi riots to woo Sikh voters after forming the government in Delhi
 jiske baad kai sikh sanghathanon kaa arvind kejariwal ko jabardast samarthan mila
 The BJP fears that the Aam Aadmi Party may not spoil their calculations in the Lok Sabha elections like the Assembly
 pashchimi dilli loksabhaa kshetra main sikh votaron kii acchhee khaasi taadaad he jahaan aam aadmi party ne sardaar jaranel singh ko maidan main utaara he to vahiin bijepi ne jat samudaay se parvesh verma ko apana ummidavaar banaaya he
 It will be interesting to see now whether they get the benefit of this effort of the BJP and the Akalis even in the Lok Sabha elections

 obama prashasan ne aaj kaha ki uttar korea ko apana parmaanu kaarykram band kar dena chahie or sitambar 2005 main kiye gaye apane vaayade ko puraa karnaa chahie
 The US made the remarks in response to a letter sent by North Korea to the Security Council
 patr main uttar korea ne bataaya he ki vah uranium sanvardhan prakriya ke antim charan main pahunch chukaa he
 US Department of State spokesman Ian Kelly said, "north Korea needs to back out of any kind of nuclear program
" use sitambar 2005 main apane dwaara kii gai patibaddhta ko puraa karne kaa prayaas karnaa chahie
 And in this way actual disarmament can occur in the Korean peninsula
 keli ne kaha, ‘‘ham usase sirf yahi aagrah karenge ki vah (uttar korea) baatcheet kii mej par waapas laute or hamaare lakshya kii prapti ke liye chah paksheeya bhagidaaron ke saath jude
 In response to a question, he said, "we are very concerned about these claims which say that North Korea is very close to making nuclear weapons
" unhone kaha ki america in daavon ko lekar chintit to he, lekin in daavon ke sach hone ko lekar abhi koi pushti nahin kar saktaa
 Even if you do not get in the queue of petrol pump everyday, do not consider yourself untouched by the rising prices of crude oil
 petrol or dijal ke badhate daamon ke alaava ubalte tel se upajati mahangaai bhale charchaa kaa vishay na bane lekin dabe paanv yah aapaki jeb main send laga leti he
 For example, if the ration bill has increased in the last few months, the weight of biscuits, chips, soap, surf packets has been reduced, the expense of getting home paint is coming more than expected or the auto-tempo people have increased the rent
 Do not be surprised, these are the side effects of rising crude oil prices
 darasal, paint, plastic, packaging material, textiles, cosmetics, dawa-urvarak samet kai anya udyogon main tel yaa isse banane vaale utpaadon kaa istemaal hota he
 In such a situation, the cost of companies increases when the price of crude oil rises and the companies pass it on to the consumer in many ways
 yahi kaaran he ki paint, polish, baaltee, magga, mombatti, chips, biscuit, vaseline, sabun, surf, chaataa, parafum, nail polish jaisi dainik upyog main aane vaali kai choti-badi chizon ke yaa to daam bad jate hai yaa phir companiyaan packet ke andar ke saamaan kii maatra ko kam kar detii hai
 Significantly, during the last one year, the prices of crude oil have increased by more than 43 percent
 sitambar 2017 main antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii keemat 57
 It was at $ 54 per barrel (about 159 liters), while in September 2018, the price was close to $ 82
 tel kii teji baaki haivaishvik or gharelu donon hi bazaaron main kachche tel kii keemton main teji jari rahane ke anumaan lagaae ja rahe hai
 Rajiv Singh, Chief Executive Officer, Karvy Stock Broking, says, "crude oil prices may touch $ 90 a barrel by the end of 2018
 agar puure saal main kachche tel kii keemat ausatan 90 dollar rahati hai, to sarkaar ke chaalu khaataa ghate par 0
 There will be an additional burden of 3 per cent
 ''kachche tel kii badhati keemten aam aadmi ke liye to mahangaai lekar aati hi hai, saath hi sarkaar ke liye bhi sirdard banati hai
 Says Rajiv, "aviation, Transport and Logistics, Paint, FMCG, Tire, Petrochemical, Cement are among the sectors which have the highest impact due to rising crude oil prices
 '' in kshetron kii companiyon ke munaafe par ek se saadhe teen fisadi tak kii chot pahonchegi, jiskaa asar utpaadon kii keemton par bhi dekhne ko milegaa
 In such a situation, even if you do not see inflation rising in the government figures, you will definitely be able to feel it on the ground during the shopping of festivals
 packet main band mahangaaiaajkal bikne vaale zyaadaatar utpaadon main packing kaa vishesh mahatv hota he
 Whether FMCG companies or cosmetics — pay special attention to packing products to attract customers
 packaging material kshetra main desh kii diggaj company euphlex ke mukhya vittiya adhikari rajesh bhaatia kehete hai, "packaging material industry kii laagat main 50 fisadi kii hissedari kachche tel se nikalne vaale utpaadon kii hi he
 In the same way, packaging film has also become expensive in the same proportion as the prices of crude oil have increased by almost 50% in the last one year
 '' kachche maal ke alaava petrol-dijal kii badhati keemton ke kaaran transportesan kii cost bhi badi he
 Says Rajesh, "the company's margins will not have much impact as we have pushed the entire increase to our client companies
 aise main upabhokta ke str par mahangaai baduya swaabhaavik he
 Packaging of 15 to 20 per cent of the companies' businesses
 sabase zyada asar aisi companiyon par padataa he jinke packet to bade hote hai andar saamaan kii maatra kam hoti he
 For example, chips, snacks etc
 mahangi hogi diwaleeis diwaali apane ghar ko raushan karne ke liye mombatti kharidne se lekar paint karwaane tak ke liye aapako zyada paise kharch karne honge
 Abhijit Roy, Managing Director and CEO of Berger Paints India Limited, says, “on the lines of the global market, there has been a jump in crude prices in the domestic market as well
 badi hui laagat ke asar ko kam karne ke liye is saal paint companiyaan do baar keemten badha chuki hai
 "paint, thinner is used for all these things while painting the house
" tel kii badhati keemton se ye sabhi chijen mahangi ho jaati hai
 Roy also says, "people's choice is also changing over time, which is why the demand for premium products in cities is constantly increasing
 ''textiles or paper industry ko chemical supplai karne vaali company rajeev chemical privet limited ke nideshak rajeev sharma kehete hai, "kachche tel kii keemton main ai teji ke kaaran beete ek saal main textis industry main istemaal hone vaali daai kii keemat 30 fisadi se zyada bad gai he
 Apart from this, the cost of transport has also increased
 iskaa asar kapade kii keemton par padegaa
 In the textile industry, the cost of dye is 30 to 35 per cent
 poliester bhi kachche tel kaa hi ek biproduct he, jiskaa istemaal baari maatra main kapade banane main hota he
 In such a situation, on Diwali, you will get more price than previous years
 petrol-dijal kii keemten bad jane ke kaaran dhulaai or sawari gadipoon ke kiraaye main bhi badhotaree hui he
 Trilochan Singh Dhillon, chairman of delhi-ncr at All India Motor Transport Congress, says, "as the price of diesel increases, fares increase
 pichley saal kii tulana main is samay trek ke bhaade main 25 fisadi badhotaree hui he
 "increasing freight has a big impact
 ek ore jahaan gaanv se shaharon kii mandi tak pahunchane vaali sabji mahangi ho jaati he, vahiin duusari taraf shaharon main taxi ke bhaade bad jate hai
 The cost of transportation accounts for a large share in transporting goods from factories to consumers
 plastic product banane vaali company supreme industries ke dipti general manager (emports) aar
 Says Padmasanan, "importing the raw material needed to make plastic products does not increase prices too much, but the cost of transportation has gone up by 20 per cent, which makes the consumer getting expensive
 '' mumbai se dilli tak trek bhejne main teen maheene pehle 90,000 ru
 Used to be, now Rs 1,15,000
 kaa kharchaa aata he
 In such a situation, the consumer will surely find things made of plastic expensive
 padmasanan kehete hai, "desh main mahangaai kii ek badi vajah tex dhaanche main vyaapt khamiyaan hai
 Petrol in Mumbai is 90 rupees a liter, with a tax of 47 rupees
 yah tex janit mahangaai kaa bada hissaa he
 "the pain deepened by the rupee's weakness, the price of a dollar has crossed $ 74
 janvari se ab tak dollar ke mukaable rupaya 14 fisadi tak tut chukaa he
 The current market conditions indicate further weakness of the rupee
 kamjor rupaya kachche tel kii mahangaai ko or badha rahaa he
 India imports around 80 per cent of its total consumption
 kamjor rupye ke kaaran kaccha tel aayaat karne ke liye zyada dollar kharch karne padate hai
 Its effect varies from the state treasury to the pocket of the common man
 kachche tel ke utpaadon se banane vaali chizon kii fehrist dekhenge to lagegaa ki tel ke bina jivan sambhav nahin he
 While crude oil was at its lowest level, inflation may not have declined due to tax hit, but it will definitely make the festival feel dull

 Anupam Kher had earlier given a statement as to why his film is not being shown in JNU
 haalanki, ab anupam kher ko campus main is film kii screening kii ijaajat mili he
 On this occasion, Anupam Kher, referring to the opposition of the country, said that you want freedom from hunger
 
 
 ye bataaen ki aapane iske liye kya kiya
 Anupam Kher posed the question that the doers should tell what their contribution is for the country? Anupam Kher said that some people are busy mobilizing students who shout anti-national slogans, but is this correct? Attacking the students shouting slogans, Anupam Kher said that you say my parents are poor, then you did something for your parents? Efforts are being made to make the student who came out on Bell in the charges of anti-national sloganeering
 anupam kher ne ek sher bhi padhaa- 'umr bhar apane girebaan se ulajhane vaale tu mujhe mere hi saae se daraata kya he'
 During the program of Anupam Kher, some students belonging to Left organizations also protested

 Rating agency Fitch said on Monday that it would be a challenge for the government to keep the oil subsidy at the fixed target in the current financial year and the government may be forced to put oil subsidy of about Rs 45,000 crore in the budget for the next financial year
 agency kaa maananaa he ki is vitt varsh main laagat se kam keemat par petroleum utpaadon kii briki se hone vaala nuksaan (under recovery) kaa kendriya bajet par padane vaala kul boj 65 hajaar karod rupee rahegaa
 Fitch has said in a report, the government will have to take about 45 thousand crore rupees from the next budget, however, we believe that a slight monthly increase will continue
 agency ke anusaar sarkaar ne is vitt varsh ke bajet main tel sabsidi mad main 65 hajaar karod rupee rakhe the jisamen se vah 45 hajaar karod rupee pehle hi tel vipanan companiyon ko chaalu vitt varsh ke dauraan sabsidi antar kii purti ke liye de chuki he

 musalamaanon se judi teen talaak kii pratha par supreme court main paanch jajon kii ek bench sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 The court made it clear during the hearing of the case that they would review whether triple talaq is an integral part of religion
 vahiin ajtak samvaadadaata ne is babat jab pune ke moulana saiyad shahabuddin salphi firdausi se baat kii, to unhone saaf kaha ki muslamaanon kii pavitra pustak quran main ek saath teen talaak kaa zikr nahin he
 According to Firdausi, nowhere in the Quran is it written to divorce three wives in a single meeting, divorce, divorce
 isliye is tarah se jaldbaaji main talaak dena islam kaa majaak udaana he or muslim mahilaon par julm dhana he
 In a conversation with Aaj Tak, Maulana Firdausi says, "the method of divorce that Islam has described does not bring the matter of three divorces in a single meeting, so it is wrong to divorce a wife in such a way and to hold back the honor of the halalamuslim women and their respect Has to be wired
 halaala kaa bhi islam se koi taluk nahin
 Asked about the right way to divorce, Maulana Firdausi said, the Muslim religious text Quran Majid states that Shauhar should not hurry to divorce
 use pehle apni bivi ko samajhane kii koshish kerani chahie
 The first attempt i
e
 step number one - the tension between the two, which should be between the two, and the husband should advise his wife, explain and talk about living together
 is par agar bivi nahin maan rahi, to uske saath shaareerik sambandh bananaa band kar dena chahie
 During this, the husband and wife have to sleep together in the same room, but should not have a physical relationship
 is duusari step se bhi agar baat na bane, to donon ko apane jaan-pahchaan waalon or bujurgon ko apni duriyon kii baat bataani chahie or ve log ek baar phir mia-bivi ko samajhaae
 Firdausi explains, after these three attempts of reconciliation, the husband and wife have to spend three months in a house and after that step of divorce should be taken, which is the right way for three steps
 step- 1 :chaar deevaaron ke bich ke in teen koshishon ke baad agar donon nahin maane, to gavaah rakhkar pati ko patni se kahana he ki maine tumhen talaak diya or iske baad ek maheene tak ek saath ek ghar main rahanaa he or ek hi bistar par sona he, lekin is dauraan bivi se shaareerik sambandh nahin rakhana he
 In this one month, if the husband's mind changes and he has to continue with his wife at home, then they can have a physical relationship
 step-2 :agar mia-bivi main is dauraan sulah nahin hui, to agle maheene pati ko patni se duusari baar kahana he maine tuje talaaq diya
 Even after this, the husband has to stay at home with his wife and sleep in a bed and if there is not a physical relationship in the second month, then in the third month the talk goes away
 step-3 :tisare maheene bhi pati ko patni se teesri baar kahana he ki maine tuje talaaq diya, to phir ye samajha jaataa he ki talaak ho gaya
 Maulana Syed Shahabuddin Salfi Firdausi says this is the way of divorce in Islam
 vah kehete hai, agar pati ne do talaaq jabaan se kah kar de di or donon ke bich phir bhi baat nahin bani or teen maheene kaa samay biit gaya or donon alag ho gaye
 However, if after some time both can marry again and stay together
 moulana firdausi ke mutabik vah pichley 36 saalon se talaak ke is sahi tareeke ke bare main desh bhar ke pratishthit moulanaon ko likh chuke hai, lekin kisi ne bhi ab tak likhit rup ke na to inkaar kiya he or na hi is tareeke kaa samarthan kiya he
 According to Firdosi, that is why he decided to put his point before the media
 maharashtra ke sholapur shahar ke rahane vaale 62 varshiya moulana saiyad shahabuddin salphi firdausi duniya bhar main islam ke prachaar-prasar ke liye ghume hai

 Know, these special things about novelist Ved Prakash Sharma - He went to school till the age of 12 but due to the shortcomings of the education system, he stopped going
 - unhen puraana, ramayana, mahabharat or bhagavat puraana kaa acha gyaan tha
 - He said that all humans have God but not every human is God, so they have to face problems
 jaane, mahaan shaayar mirza gaalib se judi baaten
 
 
 - Ramakrishna's consciousness was so solid that the form he wished, became a reality for him
 - 16 agast ramakrishna paramhans kii mahasamadhi ke din ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 It is said that once Vivekananda thought of going to the Himalayas to do penance in solitude
 wo isaki ajna lene apane guru ramakrishna paramhans ke paas pahunche the

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter jeenyu parisar main 9 farvari ko yojit kaarykram kaa somvaar ko ek nayaa video saamne aayaa he jisamen vishvavidhyalay ke chaatr sangh ke adhyaksh kanhaiya kumaar us bheed kaa hissaa hai jisamen kuch log bharat virdohi naare laga rahe hai
 At one point, Kanhaiya is seen standing near some police officers who are checking the credentials of some youths who had come to participate in the program organized to hang the Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru
 baharhaal video main yah nahin dikhataa ki kanhaiya bharat virdohi naare laga rahe hai
 a police source said that they are investigating the video
 jis din kanhaiya ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha us din ek anya video adaalat kaksh main chalaaya gaya tha
 The comments saat minute ke video main aadha cheharaa dhanka ek yuvak ‘aaazaad kashmir’ kii maang karte hue naare lagaataa dikh rahaa he
 He has not been identified yet
 is video main kuch yuvak police adhikariyon se parisar se baahar jane ke liye kah rahe hai
 Earlier, Delhi Police Commissioner BS Bassi claimed that Kanhaiya had raised anti-india slogans during the controversial program
 ek jagah kanhaiya kuch police adhikariyon ke najadik khadey dikhte hai jo kuch yuvakon kaa parichay patr jaanch rahe hai jo sansad hamale ke doshi afjal guru ko faansee par latakaane ke khilaaf yojit kaarykram main hissaa lene aae hue the
 However, the video does not show Kanhaiya shouting anti-india slogans
 police ke ek sutara ne kaha ki video kii ve jaanch kar rahe hai
 On the day Kanhaiya was arrested, another video was played in the court room
 tippaniyan In the seven-minute video, a young man with half his face is seen shouting slogans demanding 'azad Kashmir'
 uski pahchaan abhi tak nahin hui he
 In this video, some youths are asking police officers to leave the premises
 isse pehle dilli police ke ayukta bies bassi ne daawa kiya ki kanhaiya ne vivaadaaspad kaarykram ke dauraan bharat virdohi narebaaji kii thi

 loksabhaa main teen talaak bill paas hone ke baad ab rajyasabha kii baari he
 The central government today introduced the triple talaq bill in the upper house
 aise main ek baar phir ab vipakshi takat kii pariksha he, kyonki endie ko rajyasabha main bahumat nahin he or vipaksh majboot he
 But the way the RTI bill and the UAPA bill came to fruition and there was a dent in the opposition unity, it would be a big success for the Modi government
 teen talaak bill par rajyasabha main ho rahi puri charchaa padhein
 
 
 This time, the BJP has a strong majority in the Warlok Sabha in the Rajya Sabha, which is why the triple talaq bill was easily passed there
 lekin ab pariksha rajyasabha main honi he
 Congress, BJP have issued whip to their mps and have been asked to be present in the House
 pichley kuch dinon main vipaksh jis tarah lagaataar walkout karata aa rahaa he, aise main is baar bhi sadan main bill ko paas karana sarkaar ke liye aasaan nahin hoga
 What does the number game say now? The total number of members in the Rajya Sabha is 245, but 4 seats are still vacant
 aise main bahumat hasil karne ke liye 121 kii sankhya kii jarurat he
 On the other hand, NDA has a total of 104 figures on its own
 (bhaajapa 78, jediu 6, shivasena 3, akali dal 3, manonith-nirdaleey 12) inamen se jediu ne teen talaak bill kaa virodh karne kii baat kahi he
 At the same time, the opposition also has 109 numbers
 haalanki, mana ja rahaa he ki YSR congress, jediu, tiares or ediemke sadan main matdaan ke dauraan anupasthit rah sakate hai
 In such a situation, even if they are not present, it will make a difference
 RTI bill or UAPA bill jaisaa hoga game?is bich vipaksh ko ummid he ki vah is bill ko roak legi to vahiin bijepi ko bhi apane kuch doston par bharosa he
 Because the way the BJD, TRS and YSR Congress supported the government during the RTI bill and UAPA bill, the entire game of Rajya Sabha was overturned
 rajyasabha main BJD ke paas 7, YSR ke paas 2 or TRS ke paas 6 saansad hai
 That is, if those 15 who are stuck on NDA 104 also go with them today, then it will have some ease in approaching the majority
 virodh karegi aam aadmi partitin talaak bill par sanjay singh kaa kahana he ki is bill ko select cameti main bheja janaa chahie isamen bahut saare aise mudde hai jo ki galat hai
 Why the triple talaq case was criminalized, criminalizing a particular community is being targeted
 aam aadmi party ke teen saansad hai, teenon iske virodh main vot karenge
 Sanjay Singh says that people who cannot give justice to the poor and women affected by rape
 unako is tareeke kaa bill laane kaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 Through this, the government is doing its vote bank politics and trying to bake political loaves, we oppose this bill

 On Saturday, Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari went to Gokulpur village and broke the sealed lock of a house with his own hands
 ab yah maamla nayaa rang letaa dikhaai de rahaa he
 In fact, when the 'aajtak' team visited this area on Monday morning, people told that the landlord Prem Singh had been living in this house for 2 years after rearing two buffalo, but at 6 am on Friday morning, the MCD team suddenly Arriving and sealed the house
 gokulpurgaanv ke pradhan sonu pahalwaan ne kaha ki nigam ke log yahaan janata ko naahak pareshaan kar rahe hai jo ki galat he
 The village head told that our village comes in Lal Dora
 ham yahaan koi factory nahin chalaa rahe hai, ham yahaan bhens paal rahe hai
 But the house was sealed despite it being a Red Dora
 isi mudde par charchaa karne ke liye ravivaar kisubah gaanvvaasiyonne panchayat bulaai thi or isi panchayat main sthaneey saansad manoj tiwari pahunche the
 According to local residents, Manoj Tiwari told the forum that the public should not allow the MCD to be sealed, oppose it
 jab janata ne saansad manoj tiwari ko prem singh ke sil ghar kii jaankaree di to saansad manoj tiwari ne khud us ghar kaa taala tod diya
 The owner Prem Singh accused the MCD that even when he was building a house, his lanter was broken and in return MCD took a bribe of 50 thousand from him
 prem singh ne kaha ki makaan sil karne se pehle emsidi ko unhen notice dena chahie tha, magar bina notice die, sidhe aakar makaan sil kar diya gaya
 When the house was sealed, the family was present in their house
 prem singh ke mutabik subah 6 baje emsidi kii team ai or unke gharavaalon ko baahar nikaalkar sil kar diya
 According to the people of the area, no notice was given

 Surprisingly, when the team of 'aaj Tak' visited the street, it found that 2 factories are running 10 steps away from the house which was sealed, but there was no such action
 parivaar kii safal or samrudh viraasat, bada sanghathan, sipahasalaron kii fouj or jitod mehnat bhi bataur congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko raajnneeti ke us mukaam tak nahin pahunchaa saki jahaan unase pehle gandhi-nehru parivaar ke kai log na sirf pahunche, balki lambey samay tak bane rahe
 In his nearly 20-month journey as Congress President, there were major successes in the form of electoral victories in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, but the party's crushing defeat in this year's Lok Sabha elections was a big sign of his failure and with it His innings as the head of the party also got blocked
 adhyaksh rahete hue gandhi ne party kii kaary samskruti main badlaav kaa prayaas kiya
 He took steps to bring transparency in ticket allocation, working style of the organization and started the tradition of holding elections in the organization
 purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi or congress kii purv adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke putr rahul ne apni siyaasi pari ke aagaaj se hi media, aamajan or bauddhik varg kaa dhyaan khinchaa or pehle party ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh bane phir disambar, 2017 main gujarat chunaav ke samay congress adhyaksh bane
 The Congress lost the Gujarat elections by a small margin, but many political experts praised Gandhi's leadership and the party's election strategy
 gandhi ke adhyaksh banane ke baad 2018 main karnataka vidhansabha chunaav main congress kii haar hui to 2018 ke aakhir main hue madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress kii jeet ne unke netritv main party kaaryakartaaon kaa vishwaas badhaane kaa kaam kiya
 Encouraged by the victory in these three Hindi-speaking states, the Congress and Gandhi felt that the Center would also return to power in the 2019 elections, but the bjp's major victory under Prime Minister Narendra Modi dashed their hopes
 saath hi apni paramparaagat amethi seat par unki haar unke liye doharaa jhatka lekar ai
 The disappointing performance of the main opposition party in the Lok Sabha elections is that it was able to increase its tally of 44 seats in 2014 to just a few seats and got 52 seats
 chunaav se pehle or chunaav ke dauraan bhi kai jaankaron kaa yah kahana tha ki agar congress siton kaa shatak bhi laga leti he to vah uske or party adhyaksh rahul gandhi liye sahaj sthiti hogi, haalanki aisa nahin hota dikh rahaa
 The entire party, led by Congress President Rahul Gandhi, kept the campaign focused on Prime Minister Modi and launched a 'chowkidar Chor Hai' campaign alleging corruption in the Rafale plane deal, in response to which Modi and BJP started the 'main Bhi Chowkidar' campaign

 rahul gandhi ne rafel mudde ke alaava ‘nunatam aay guarantee' (nyaay) yojana ko masterstroke ke taur par pesh kiya
 The party hoped that its promise to give 72 thousand rupees annually to the poor would blunt the edge of bjp's nationalism discourse, while in reality it did not
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki congress ke ‘nakaaratmak' prachaar abhiyaan ke saath party athwa vipakshi gathbandhan kii taraf se netritv kaa spasht nahin hona bhi baari padaa
 While taking command of the party's campaign campaign, Gandhi also avoided the question of the Prime Minister's post or the leadership from the opposition directly or indirectly
 vah baar baar yahi kehete rahe ki janata maalik he or uskaa faisla sweekaar kiya jayega
 Rahul Gandhi resigned from the post of party president in the CWC meeting held on May 25 after the Congress' debacle in the Lok Sabha elections
 us vakt unke istife ko asweekaar karte hue seedblusi ne unhen party main amulchul badlaav ke liye adhikrut kiya tha, haalanki gandhi apane rukh par ade rahe or spasht kar diya ki na to vah or na hi gandhi parivaar kaa koi doosraa sadsy is jimmedaari ko sanbhaalega
 By the way, Gandhi has also said that he will continue to work actively for the party despite not being president
 bhartiya team ke twanti20 vishwa cap se jaldi baahar hone ke kaaran sachin tendulkar ne bhi prayek prashansak kii tarah niraashaa jataayi lekin swadesh main isko lekar pradarshan or anya tarah kii kadi pratikriya se vah puri tarah asahmat hai
 Tendulkar said that he was disappointed that India could not defend his title but with this he felt that there should be a response (responsible and balanced) from the fans at home
 tendulkar ne kaha kimain maanata hum ki jab log pratikriya karte hai to un par bhavanaaen haaavee rahati he
 But will such responses help us perform better
 katai nahin
 This actually puts more pressure on the players
 hamen paripakvata dikhaakar team kaa saath dena chahie
 He told a private channel in India that no one can change what has passed, but always take lessons from it and do well in the future
 safalataa or asafalataa donon par hamaari pratikriya adhik jimmedaari bhari or santulit honi chahie
 This will make it easier for everyone

 iske liye lau kamishan kii report kaa intjaar kiya ja rahaa he, taaki ipisi kii puraani dhaaraon ko badla ja sake

 By the way, negligence has been done in this case so far and the MLA is not being arrested
 isi kaaran kai tarah ke sawaal uth rahe hai, jinke jawaab milanaa kaaphi jarur ho gaya he
 Waiting for the answer to these questions
 
 
 - aadhi raat ko vidhayak kaa sarender kaa tamaasha, kya sirf jaanch kaa dikhaava ?- maamle ke 260 din baad aaropee MLA par cese kaa kya matlab?- agar vidhayak par poxo act ke tahat cese darj kiya gaya he, to phir giraftaar kyon nahin kii gai
 While arrest is necessary in this case
 - kya cese darj hone ke baad bhi rajya sarkaar vidhayak ko bachaane main juty he?- kya hoga agar giraftaar se pehle hi vidhayak kahin bhaag jaae?- upi police ne maamla sibiai ko saunpane kii baat kahi he, lekin agar sibiai hi is cese ko lene se manaa kar de to kya hoga
 Because in many cases, it has been seen that CBI refuses to take many cases
 upi police boli- abhi sirf aaropee hai vidhayakabata den ki guuruuvaar ko uttar pradesh police ke dijipi opi singh ne is maamle main press conference kii
 On the question of the arrest of the accused legislator, UP DGP OP Singh says that he is currently the only accused

 France's leading newspaper France 24 has said how the deal started in 2007 to include the private sector Reliance Defense, excluding Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in 2015? France 24 wrote that the Rafale deal started in 2007 In 2007, when the Indian Defense Ministry issued its largest tender in 2007, it took the initiative to purchase 126 multi-role fighter aircraft
 raksha mantralay kii ye kharidari isliye jaruri ho gai kyonki us vakt desh main istemaal ho rahe roosi vimaanon puraane ho chuke the or raksha chunautiyon ko puraa karne main sakasham nahin the
 After the negotiations of Manmohan Singh for 5 years in the deal order, the Congress government led by Manmohan Singh declared that the French company Dassault had won the tender of the Ministry of Defense
 dasolt rafel kii manuphaccharing karata he or 2012 ke is samjhaute ke mutabik raksha mantralay seva main turant tainaat karne ke liye 18 rafel ladaaku vimaanon kii kharid francisi company se karegaa
 At the same time, Dassault will assemble the remaining 108 fighter aircraft in India with the Indian government company Hindustan Aeronautics Limited
 ise padhein: rafel par koun kar rahaa he gumraah? rahul, maikron, nirmala main galat koun?france 24 ke mutabik is deal ke vakt bharat kaa maananaa tha ki is deal se bharat sarkaar kii arospes or dephence company echeel kii aadhunik utpaadan kshamta main ijapha hoga or vah desh ke liye ladaaku vimaan banane ke liye taiyaar ho jaaegi
 According to France 24, the Congress government's deal remained stuck for the next three years due to a dispute over price and capacity
 jahaan shuruyaat main yah deal mahaj 12 billian dollar kii thi vah badhkar 20 billian dollar par pahunch gai
 The price increase was based on the fact that the Indian government was trying to get some fighter aircraft manufactured in India
 narendra modi kii deal or deal main twistbharat main may 2014 main satta parivartan hua aurnarendra modike netritv main bijepi sarkaar bani
 At the end of the first year of his tenure, Prime Minister Modi visited France and invited French companies to sign agreements with India under the Make in India program
 modi ne yah nimantran civil newclear energy, dephence or food processing kshetra kii francisi companiyon ko diya
 On this visit, Prime Minister Modi announced the deal from Paris
 haalanki nai deal ke mutabik ab bharat ko mahaj 36 ladaaku vimaan kharidne the
 So only 8 to the government on the whole deal
 7 billian dollar kharch karne the
 The special thing was that all 36 fighter jets would be manufactured in France itself and the finished aircraft would be handed over to India
 nai deal kaa vivaadit pakshais deal ke saath hi bharat or france kii sarkaar ke bich samjhauta kiya gaya ki is deal se dasolt ko hui kul kamai kaa aadha hissaa company ko ek nishchit tareeke se waapas bharat main nivesh karnaa hoga
 This side of the deal was called the offset clause
 lihaaja, deal ke tahat dasolt ko yah sunishchit karnaa tha ki vah 8
 Invest half of the $ 7 billion back into India's defense sector
 echeel baahar or ambani andarfrance 24 apni report ne kahati he ki deal main hua ek ahm badlaav sabko aashcharyachakit karne vaala tha
 In India, HAL had 78 years of manufacturing experience in the defense sector and was the only company in this offset clause to be decided in its favor
 lekin dasolt ne echeel se qaraar todate hue anil ambani kii reliance group se qaraar kar liya
 The special thing is that till this time, Reliance had no experience of manufacturing the defense sector even far from the aviation sector
 ise padhein: EXCLUSIVE: india today ne khoj nikaala neerav modi kaa landan kaa thikanaavahin france 24 reliance samooh ke pramukh anil ambani ke liye likhata he ki unka itihaas vivaadon se bharaa he
 While Anil Ambani's elder brother became the richest Indian in Global Forbes Silt after equal sharing of family property, Anil Ambani himself reached the 45th spot in this list
 iske alaava anil ambani kaa telecom sector main venture ghate main chalaa gaya or unki company hajaaron karod ke karj main dab gai jise ubaarane ke liye apana telecom kaarobaar unhen bade bhai mukesh ambani ko bechnaa padaa
 At the same time, Anil Ambani's role in the telecom spectrum scam was doubtful
 deal se 15 din pehle bani company?france 24 ne daawa kiya ki bharat main vipaksh ke netaa rahul gandhi ne ek anya francisi akhbaar ko die intervyuu main sawaal khadaa kiya ki aakhir kis aadhaar par is deal se ek anbhavi company ko baahar karte hue ek aisi company ko jagah di gai jisane is kshetra main kabhi kaam nahin kiya
 Along with this, France 24 claimed that the Indian company that Dassault preferred over HAL was established just 15 days before the deal
 khasbaat yah he ki company ko sthapit karne kii yah taarikh pradhanmantri narendra modi ke france daure se mahaj 13 din pehle kii he

 yah surveykshan aise samay hua jab jabardast rajnatik uthaa-patake ho rahi thiah orissa main biju janata dal (bijd) ne rajg se 10 saal purana naata todane kii ekatarfa ghoshnaa kar di; upie main varisht sahyogiyon ne gathbandhan main hi ek taqatvar gut bana liya, to tamilnadu main ek mahatvapurn saajheedaar piemke tisare morche main shaamil anna dramuk ke kheme main chali gai
 The survey gives a glimpse into the situation affected by the changing equations of the three main players
 natijatan, sattadhari upie 196-205 siten jeet saktaa he
 This figure is far less than the 234 seats it got five years ago
 bhaajapa kii aguai vaale rajg ko 172-181 siten aa sakati hai
 This means that this number is less than the 184 seats it got in 2004
 ekmaatr phaayde main he, tisare morche or 'anya' se gathit bhaanumati kaa kunba, jiskaa aakaar or rup do bade gathbandhanon main maamuli se jatke se bhi badalata rahata he
 Every time the elections are announced, this faction, which has invented the affinity of new relations, has made a tremendous increase in its table
 ise milane vaali sambhavit siton kii sankhya 2004 main use hasil 125 siton ke mukaable 169 or 178 ke bich ho sakati he, jo use vastutah rajg ke ekadam kareeb pahunchaa detii he
 This situation has changed completely compared to just two years ago
 india today-oarji-maarg ke janvari 2007 main hue rashtriya janamanas surveykshan main upie kii siton main 2004 ke mukaable kaaphi sudhaar najar aa rahaa tha
 Then 40 him
 2 fisadi vot or 270 siten milane kii ummid lag rahi thi
 41 of the NDA led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the 1999 Lok Sabha elections
 7 fisadi vot paakar 304 siten jeetne ke baad kisi party yaa gathbandhan ne 38 fisadi vot kii hissedari kaa aankada paar nahin kiya he
 The same poll two years ago gave the 'third Front and others' 25 of the total votes
 9 fisadi or 115 siten di thim
 Although 33 in the survey to the NDA
 9 fisadi mat mili the, lekin uski siton kaa aankada kam hokar maatr 155 par tikaa rahaa tha
 Ironically, in the latest poll, the NDA seats are increasing by 20-30, while the number of votes it receives is decreasing by 4 per cent
 lekin upie ko siton or vot hissedari donon kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 This time she got 5 compared to the votes she got in 2007
 9 fisadi vot kam milane kii ummid he
 On the other hand, the Third Front and others are benefiting both ways
 unke paksh main sakaaratmak voton main 9
 There has been a 9 percent increase
 surveykshan se yah bhi spasht hua he ki ek samaan jhukaav ke din ab lad gaye
 The BJP has suffered significantly in the east and south, having left the BJD and having no allies in the important Tamil Nadu in the south, although it has gained little in the north and west
 upie kaa chaaron taraf nuksaan hua he
 7 to her south
 13 fisadi or pashchim main 0
 a loss of 06 per cent is being done
 tisare morche ke paksh main baari jhukaav dakshin or purv main mili badhat ke chalate he, jo uttar or pashchim ke maamuli nuksaan kii bharpai kar detaa he
 The survey has revealed some surprises and some very probable results
 11 saal main pehali baar atal bihari vaajapeyi kii jagah manmohan singh pradhanmantri pad ke liye sarvaadhik upyukt ummidavaar maane gaye hai
 In our February 2008 survey, which was done after Vajpayee withdrew from power and virtually disappeared from the headlines, he was far ahead of his rivals, including Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh
 manmohan singh pehali baar 18 fisadi mat paakar 15 fisadi mat paane vaali sonia gandhi se kahin aage hai, to vaajapeyi tisare sthaan par hai tathaa apni hi party ke primaministar-in-vatting laalkrishna adwani se kahin aage hai, jinhen 12 fisadi vot mili
 While every other Indian of the three still believes that the strength behind Sonia Manmohan Singh's throne remains, 57 per cent of voters believe that UPA has not fulfilled the promises as per the Common Minimum Program
 43 fisadi matadaataaon ko lagata he ki yadi gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko agle chunaavon main pradhanmantri pad ke pratyaashee taur par pesh kiya jaataa he to bhaajapa ko iskaa khaasaa laabh mil saktaa he
 The survey also reveals that when Manmohan Singh told former US President George Bush in Washington last year that Indians loved Americans, they were messing with the truth
 yah poochne par ki kya bharat ke america ke saath ghanishtha sambandh hone chahie, 64 fisadi logon kaa jawaab nakaaratmak tha
 Yet the fact that long queues for visas in front of the US embassy in New Delhi and its consulates in metros may prove that people do not always vote the way they say
 of spinner ravichandran aswin kaa maananaa he ki mahendra singh dhoni kii shandaar ballebaaji form unki captaini main bhi najar aati he jisaki madad se bharat shandaar pradarshan karte hue australia ke khilaaf pehla test jeetne main safal rahaa
 Ashwin said before the second cricket Test starting on Saturday, 'I think after the match, he himself said that he is not confident that he will be able to repeat this performance
 mere kehane kaa matlab he ki usne lagbhag do satr main doharaa shatak banaaya jo asaadhaaran he
 Ashwin said, "he (dhoni) has tightened the screws on the match as captain and his performance has also shown the effect of the fielders' decor and bowling changes on the field
" ’tamilnadu ke spin gendbaaj aswin ne bhi pehle test main 12 wicket chatkaakar bharat kii jeet main ahm bhoomika nibhaai is pradarshan ke saath hi aswin ne bhi apana khoi hui form hasil kar lee he, jo bharat ke liye lihaaj se kaaphi ahm he
 Asked about the competition between the spinners, Ashwin said, 'competition is always present, it still is and will continue
 main iske bare main nahin sochataa
 These are you (media people) people who compare so why should i bother about it

 jabaki smriti irani ke namakan par nirdaleey pratyaashee rohit kumaar ne apane adhivaktaa rahul chandani ke madhyam se nirvachan adhikari se aapatti kii he
 Following this development, the BJP targeted Rahul Gandhi, as well as questioning his educational qualifications and citizenship, asking if he was ever a British citizen and how he obtained a BA and mphil degree within a gap of one year
 amethi sansadeey nirvachan kshetra ke riterning offis main shanivaar ko scrootni kii karrwai shuru hote hi rahul gandhi kaa naam pukaara gaya jiske baad chaar logon ne is par aapatti darj kara di

 rahul gandhi ke khilaaf 2014 main amethi se chunaav ladane ke dauraan diya gaya halafanama 2019 ke halafname se alag tha
 Chandani complained to the Returning Officer, accusing Smriti Irani of giving incorrect information in her affidavit and demanded that her nomination be canceled
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke liye die apane halafname main smriti ne kathith taur par kaha tha ki unhone 1994 main uniwarsity se grajuation kiya tha
 Questioning the veracity of his claim, the opposition parties had said that he was not a graduate
 rahul gandhi ke naam par aapattibijapi ne maanga javabrahul gandhi ke naam or unki shaikshanik yogyata par bhartiya janata party ne sawaal uthaaya, saath hi aarope bhi lagaaya ki rahul ne har chunaav main certificate badale hai
 BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao said that today the entire nation was stunned when the process of nomination of Rahul Gandhi was started in Amethi and after some people objected to his name being called, Rahul and his lawyer Rahul Kaushik clarification Were not ready to give
 bijepi ke pravaktaa ne kaha ki rahul gandhi kii naagarikta par yah chaunkaane vaali ghatana he
 He should be asked the question whether he was ever a British citizen
 2004 ke halafanama main rahul gandhi ne kaha tha ki unhone england kii company main nivesh nahin kiya tha jabaki 2005 main company (bacops limited) ke dastavejon ke anusaar rahul gandhi ko british naagarik bataaya gaya
 Is it not a violation of Indian citizenship law

 Questioning on educational qualification too, G
L
 Narasimha Rao questioned Rahul's educational qualification and said that some doubts are clouded over his education
 2004 main unhen senior secondary skool kaa praaanpatr mila or iske baad unhone cambridge se emphil kii degree hasil kar lee, jabaki is bich unhone kuch nahin kiya
 In 2009, he earned his new degree from Florida, a BA degree from Rollings College
 tab deveopment iconomics se emphil kiya
 In 2014, the mphil degree turned into development studies
 unhone kaha ki 2019 main rahul ne bataaya ki unhone 1994 main bie kiya or 1995 main emphil
 Now which is the university that gave ffill degree just one year after getting Bachelor degree
 10 april ko daakhil kiya tha namakancongress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne 10 april buudhvaar ko amethi seat se namakan bharaa tha

 The first general budget of the second term of the Narendra Modi government is coming today
 vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman yah aitihaasik bajet subah 11 baje sansad main pesh karengi
 Earlier on Thursday, the Economic Survey was released, praising the achievements of the Modi government and also told the roadmap for the future
 lekin aarthik surveykshan main kai aisi badi bate hai jo desh ke aarthik vikaas ke liye chintaa or chunautiyaan lekar ai hai
 According to the Economic Survey, the average growth rate since 2014
7
 5% rahi he, lekin pichley saal ye kam hokar 6
 8% is left
 aarthik surveykshan main is saal desh kii aarthik vikaas dar kaa anumaan bhi 7% hi rakhaa gaya he
 Whereas if India is to become a 5 trillion dollar economy by 2024-25, then a growth rate of 8% will be needed
 mukhya aarthik salaahkaar krishnamurthi ve
 Subramaniam himself said that India needs eight percent economic growth over the next five years to achieve the goal of making the country a $ 5,000 billion economy
 unhone kaha ki isi ke maddesner aarthik surveykshan 2018-19 main pramukh sanchaalak ke rup main nivesh par jor diya gaya he
 This is also a concern
 Among all this, the agriculture sector is a big concern
 krishi kshetra main dhimaapan or sarvice sector kii growth main giravat vikaas dar naa badhane kii ahm vajahon main ek he
 Apart from this, the poor condition of financial institutions has also been a major hindrance in the pace of economic development
 bataa den ki vittiya sansthaanon se die jane vaale karz kii rakam main vruddhi kii dar march 2018 main 30% se ghatakar march 2019 main 9% rah gai he
 Because of this, the rate of investment in the economy is also running at the lowest level, which is 19 to 20 percent less than the normal average
 iske alaava market se puunji jutanaa bhi mushkil ho rahaa he
 It has decreased by 81 percent in 2018-19
 manuphaccharing main choti companiyaan 10-10 saal puraani hone ke baavjood paryaapt vikaas nahin kar paa rahi hai
 While the number of small companies with less than 100 employees is more than 50% in the manufacturing sector
 survey main kaha gaya he ki saarvajanik kshetra ke sahyog se deshbhar main paryaapt nijee nivesh laana vastavaki chunauti he
 Provision of social infrastructure along with physical infrastructure is equally important, as both will determine where India will be placed globally in 2030
 in tamaam chunautiyon ke bich desh kii mahila vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman bajet pesh karne ja rahi hai
 In such a situation, to achieve the target of 8% growth rate of $ 5 trillion economy, not only will the government have to change gears, but also will have to overcome the challenges with new vision

 He is very smart, now what can we say
 oh
 
 
 Thanks for the library
 pataa nahin afghanistan main us librari kaa istemaal koun kar rahaa he
 But this is just one or two things, i don't want to take full credit ''
 But one good thing in these remarks is when Trump says: “I get along very well with India, with Prime Minister Modi

 aapako bataa den pichley 7 maheenon main team india ne chhathi baar 600 se zyada kaa score banaaya he
 India is the only team to score 600 runs
 You would probably be surprised to know that in the last 7 months Team India is the only team in the world to have scored 600
 pichley takreeban 6 saalon se koi bhi team test main 600 kaa aankada nahin chhu saki he
 Started the journey against England, Team India started scoring more than 600 runs in the Mumbai Test against England
 mumbai test main team india ne 631 ran banaae

 After scoring more than 600 runs, Team India won in 4 out of 5 Tests while 1 match was drawn against Australia

 Politics has warmed over the statement comparing the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan to Vesya
 congresvidhayak ne ek baar phir siem ke liye vaishya shabd kaa istemaal karte hue vaishyaon ko siem shivaraj se behatar bataaya jise lekar somvaar kobijepiur congress main jubaani jang tej ho gai
 Let me tell you that Congress MLA Sundar Lal Tiwari from Gurh in Rewa district had called CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan a prostitute a few days ago and when he arrived in Bhopal on Saturday, he was not only adamant on his statement but also the Shivraj Told better than press conference main congress vidhayak apane saath baqayda dictionari lekar bhi aae the or usee dictionari se dekh kar tiwari ne bataaya ki unhone shivaraj ko kis sandarbh main vaishya kaha tha
 Opening the dictionary and reading from it, Sundarlal Tiwari said that "I knew that you guys would ask these questions, so i brought the dictionary with me
" main vidhayak hum or ek jimmedaar aadmi hum
 i do not regret even my saying
 angreji main prostitute kaa hindi main matlab he "apane gun, yogyata aadi ko nindit kaam main lagaana, ye bhi prostitute kaa arth he"bayaan par tilamilaai bijepisunderlaal tiwari ke is bayaan par bijepi tilamila gai he
 Vishwas Sarang, Minister of State for the state, has sought an answer from Congress President Rahul Gandhi for this
 vishwaas sanrag ne kaha he ki aapattijanak bayaanbaji par congress, manishankar ayyar ko to chunaav ke vakt baahar kar detii hai or chunaav khatm hone ke baad unako waapas le leti hai" saarang ne kaha ki "tiwari jaise sanskarahin vyakti ko takat isliye bhi mil jaati he kyonki manishankar ayyar ko galati karne ke baad bhi congress waapas le leti he"
 Sarang clearly said that the BJP will make it an election issue
 congress ne kiya tiwari ke bayaan kaa samarthanbhale hi bijepi congress vidhayak ke is bayaan par agbabula he lekin congress ne sunderlaal tiwari ke bayaan kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki jis sandarbh main tiwari ne siemshivarajko vaishya kaha wo galat nahin he
 State Congress media in-charge Shobha Ojha said that "as far as Tiwari's statement is concerned, there is no mistake in the perspective in which he said this and we have seen media by BJP leaders calling him as a Prestitute
" siem shivaraj singh ko sindhiya ji ke liye itane galat shabd bolte dekha he
 So BJP can raise a finger on anyone with a mouth
 aapako bataa den ki sunderlaal tiwari isse pehle bhi shivaraj singh chouhan ko lekar bayaan de chuke he jiske baad kaaphi hangaamaa hua tha or khud siem shivaraj ne bayaan par jawaab dete hue vaishyaon ko kisi na kisi kii bahan, maa or beti bataate hue congress ko hi kathghare main khadaa kar diya tha
 Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee on Monday criticized Team Anna for improperly and maliciously resorting to bribery against him and especially after being elected as the presidential candidate
 unhone aaropon ko galat, swarthpurna, durbhaavnapurna or gaiyr jimmedaripurn bataaya
 Reacting to the allegations leveled by Team Anna member Arvind Kejriwal, Mukherjee said that it is unfortunate that India Against Corruption, which claims to represent high moral behavior, has sent charges to the Prime Minister by throwing away its moral ground

 The circular clearly states that in schools where the number of minority children will be more than 70 percent, funds will be sent by the Department of Minority Welfare

 BJP is accused of this, that it is a plan to distribute mid-day meal in schools with majority of Muslim children
 bijepi ne bengal sarkaar ke is aadesh par sawaal uthaaya he
 BJP president of Bengal unit Dilip Ghosh said that once again the politics of dividing Bengal is being done

 When the child gets a little care, then ask him about his dream
 aapako pataa hona chahie ki usne sapane main kya dekha
 When the child is telling you about his dream, then your full attention should be on him
 use aisa nahin laganaa chahie ki aap use ignor kar rahe hai

 agar aapkaa baccha kahata he ki uske kamare main koi he to uske kahe anusaar puure kamare ko sahi se jaanchen
 When no one is seen, your child will also be confident that it was his responsibility
 use bharosa dilaane ke liye aapkaa aisa karnaa bahut jaruri he
 4
 baccha agar bahut adhik dar gaya he to aap uske kamare main hi kuch vakt bitaaiye
 Talk to him or tell him a story in your lap
 aisa karne se uskaa dhyaan hatega or use saamaanya hone main zyada vakt nahin lagegaa

 No provision of the Constitution has been violated in this bill, and Muslims are being unfairly intimidated
 aaaraseepi saansad ne derek o bryan ko jawaab dete hue kaha ki ve germany ke kansantreshan camp kii charchaa kar rahe hai, lekin yahaan koi aisi baat ho hi nahin sakati he
 He said that our country is a republic
 yahaan sabhi nagarikon ke samaan adhikaar hai, or yahi kaaran he ki hamaare main ek nahin teen-teen raashtrapati bhi alpsankhyak samaaj se hue hai, bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish hue hai

 In the corruption case, the name of Tejashwi Yadav, the younger son of Bihar Deputy Chief Minister and RJD Chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, has surfaced in the cbi's FIR and that is why the opposition parties are demanding his resignation
 is maamle par vichaar karne ke liye somvaar ko argedy ke vidhayakon kii baithak lalu prasad yadav ke ghar par hui jisamen yah faisla liya gaya ki tejasvi yadav apane pad se istipha nahin denge, kyonki jis ghotaale ke sambandh main unka naam sibiai ke exiaar main aayaa he us vakt tejasvi keval teraa saal ke the
 The opposition is also demanding from Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar that he should remove Tejashwi Yadav from his cabinet
 vahiin is puure masale par mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or unki party jadyu ne chuppi sadhi hui he
 In such a situation, the question arises that what is the compulsion of RJD and party supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav that they are standing in these circumstances along with Tejashwi
 is sawaal kaa pehla jawaab to yahi he ki tejasvi, lalu prasad yadav ke bete hai or aise main party ke netaaon kii majaburi he ki wo tejasvi ke saath aakhir dam tak khadey rahen kyonki tejasvi ke saath khadey hone kaa saaf matlab he ki wo lalu ke saath khadey hai
 If the party leader or MLA goes against Tejashwi on this occasion or demands his resignation, it would clearly mean that he is challenging the power of party chief Lalu Prasad Yadav
 ye to ho gai party ke netaaon kii majaburi lekin lalu prasad yadav kii aisi kya majaburi he ki wo apane bete ko pad par bane rahane dena chaahate hai
 Experts here believe that Lalu would not want the reins of power to go out of his family into someone else's hands
 is baat ko or pukhta karne ke liye jaankaar us vakt ko yaad karwaanaa chaahate hai jab mukhyamantri rahete hue lalu jail gaye the or unhone apni patni rabari devi ko mukhyamantri bana diya tha
 Apart from this, Lalu Yadav has another compulsion and that his political career will be destroyed if his son had to leave the post due to an allegation of corruption just few years after coming to power, and Lalu would never want that his a political eclipse will be seen on his son's political career in front and so soon
