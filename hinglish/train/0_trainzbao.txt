 Surjewala raised the question that if Modi goes to Pakistan on a personal visit then no one would mind, he cuts the cake of Nawaz Sharif there, shawls are presented, what is the policy of the Government of India on Pakistan? Responding to this, BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said that our policy on Pakistan is clear, that as long as terrorism continues, it cannot be done

 Starting from 30 November, elections will be held in five phases, due to the alliance, there will be an interesting assembly elections in Jharkhand, which is full of interesting resources
 chunaav 30 november se shuru hokar paanch charnon main sampann honge
 Like Maharashtra here, bjp's allies are seen leaving it
 inamen prabhaavshaalee sanghathan ol jharkhand student union (AJSU) bhi shaamil he jo ab bijepi se alag ho gaya he
 The BJP won 37 seats in the Jharkhand Legislative Assembly with 81 seats in 2014
 ajasu ko mili paanch siton ko milakar bijepi ne bahumat kaa aankada paar kar liya tha
 But this time these two parties are contesting separate elections, on the other hand the opposition parties Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) have aligned and they are seeing this as an opportunity
 in teenon dalon ne bhi pichhlaa chunaav alag-alag ladaa tha
 This time the competition has become interesting because of the alliance between them
 kade mukaable vaali sitenvidhansabha chunaav 2014 main 33 siten aisi thim jin par jeet-haar kaa antar 10,000 yaa isse kam tha
 This time a united opposition can put BJP in trouble in these seats
 in 33 siton main se 19 siten aisi hai jin par jeet-haar kaa antar 5,000 se kam tha
 Out of these 19, 10 seats were won by BJP and AJSU alliance, 8 by BJP and 2 by AJSU
 iske alaava jhamumo or congress ko 3-3 siten, ek babulal marandi kii party jharkhand vikaas morcha (jhavimo) or do anya ne jiti thim
 Of the seats where the margin of defeat was between 5,000 and 10,000, 7 were won by BJP alone
 jhamumo ne teen siten, congress ne 2 siten or jhavimo ne 2 jiti thim
 In this way, BJP-AJSU alliance won 17 out of the 33 seats in the fiercely contested elections, in which BJP alone won 15 seats
 bijepi kii raah aasaan nahiindia today kii data intelegence unit (DIU) ne 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ko vishleshan karne par paaya ki raajnneetik paridrishy badalane ke baad agar sabhi partiyaan apana janaadhar barkaraar rakhti hai to in kade mukaable vaali siton par bijepi kii raah aasaan nahin hogi
 By combining the vote share of JMM, Congress and RJD on these less than 10,000 margin seats, we found that BJP will lose 8 out of the last 15 seats won and AJSU will lose both of its seats
 is tarah gathbandhan kaa vot barkaraar rahane par bijepi ko in kam margin vaali siton main se sirf 7 siten mil paaengi jabaki jhamumo, congress or rajd gathbandhan ko 10 siton kaa phayda hoga
 Some seats like Ghatshila, Gumla, Lohardaga and Rajmahal on which BJP won in 2014, this time it will have to fight a lot in front of a united opposition
 ittfa se inamen se zyaadaatar siton par janajaatiy aabaadi kii acchhee sankhya hone ke kaaran jhamumo yahaan par majboot he
 However, BJP can expect a return to some important seats in this category like Giridih, Dumka and Simdega
 jyaad margin vaali siteniye ab un siton ko dekhte hai jahaan 2014 main jeet-haar kaa antar 10,000 se zyada tha
 There were 16 seats on which the win-loss difference was between 10,000 and 20,000
 in 16 main se bijepi ko 5, jhamumo ko 5, jhavimo ko 3, congress ko 1 or 2 siten anya ko mili thim
 Apart from this, 16 seats where the win-loss difference was between 20,000 and 30,000, BJP and AJSU together won 8 seats
 6 bijepi or 2 ajasu
 JMM won 5 of these, Jhavimo 1 and 2 others
 16 siten aisi thim jahaan par jeet-haar kaa antar 30,000 se zyada tha
 Of these, the BJP-AJSU alliance won 12 seats
 11 bijepi ne or 1 ajasu ne
 JMM won 3 seats and JVM won 1 seat
 sanyog se 2014 main ajasu sirf 8 siton par chunaav ladi thi or inamen se 5 siten jeet gai thi
 What does the political analyst say? Out of the total 48 seats with a margin of over 10,000, the BJP-AJSU alliance won a total of 25 seats
 inamen se 22 siten akele bijepi ko mili thim
 This time, a coalition of united opposition parties will present a tough fight for BJP in these seats
 2014 ke vot share ke aadhaar par dekhen to kuch mahatvapurn siten jahaan bhaajapa sirf 5 pratishat se kam antar ke saath ekajute vipaksh ko maat de sakati he, ve hai jamshedpur west or khunti

 This case has been registered in Jammu and Kashmir regarding his statement about alleged human rights violations
 dilli police ke special cell ne kaha ki teen sitambar ko exiaar darj kii gai he
 a case of treason was registered under a criminal complaint on the complaint of Supreme Court lawyer Alok Srivastava seeking Shehla's arrest

 a complaint was filed against him by Supreme Court lawyer Alakh Alok Srivastava
 'ab shehla rashid kii bhi is par pratikriya ai he
 Shehla Rashid termed the sedition case against him as 'trivial', 'politically motivated' and a pathetic attempt to silence him
 shehla ne apni pratikriya twit ke jariye jaahir kii
 Shehla Rashid said, "the FIR is petty, malicious and a far-reaching attempt to silence me
 main samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 ke praavdhaanon ko radd kiye jane ko sanvaidhanik chunauti dene ke maamle main ek yachikakarta hum or supreme court main hamaari yachika ise behaal karne ke sambandh main ek majboot paksh rakhti he

 She wrote on Twitter, as a political activist i was doing my job
 jin twit ke liye mujhapar nishaanaa saadhaa ja rahaa he, unamem maine logon tak suvidhaayen sunishchit karne ke prashasan ke sakaaratmak kaaryon kaa zikr kiya
 This in itself is proof that my motive was simply to throw light on the truth which was also mentioned in the news published in India and elsewhere

 Significantly, in her serial tweet, Shehla Rashid claimed that the army was indiscriminately picking up people in the valley, raiding homes and torturing people
 unhone daawa kiya tha ki ghati main sattarudh bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke agenda ko puraa karne ke liye maanavadhikaron kaa hanan kiya ja rahaa he
 People had reacted sharply to these allegations
 shehla rashid ne haalanki kaha tha ki jab bhartiya sena jaanch gathit karegi to vah saboot dene ke liye taiyaar hai
 Shehla's claims were rejected by the Indian Army and described it as 'baseless' and 'unverified'

 Bihar Police Association has issued a memorandum to the Director General of Police, seeking to withdraw the suspension
 aisa na karne par andolan karne kii dhamkee di he
 At the same time, politics has also started on the suspension of Thanedars

 K
 thakur ko thanedaar ke nilamban ke maamle ko lekar somvaar ko ek gyaapan saunpa
 In the memorandum given to the DGP, it has been mentioned that if the suspension of eleven Thanedars is not withdrawn by August 28, then about eight thousand police inspectors and under-inspectors of Bihar will separate themselves from the responsibility of the head of the police station
 bihar police associesan ne yah bhi likhaa he ki police nireekshak or police avar nireekshak apni duty to karenge lekin thanedaari nahin karenge
 The police headquarters's stance on the matter of the suspension of eleven police stations in Bihar under the strict headquarters of the Police Headquarters Act is seen to be tough
 ediji mukhyalay sunil kumaar ne kaha he ki thanedaaron ko apane-apane kshetra main sharaab par puri tarah pabandi lagane kaa sakht nirdesh diya gaya tha
 Even then, there was no ban on the manufacture and smuggling of liquor in many police stations

 Former Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi said that he is completely in favor of prohibition of liquor in Bihar but there is objection to the impractical steps being taken in Bihar
 purv mukhyamantri ne kaha ki sharabbandi ko lekar jis tarah ke kanoon banaae gaye hai usase na keval bihar kii janata dehshat main hai balki police adhikari bhi bhayakrant hai
 Manjhi said that the police officers were working sincerely
 lekin ab sarkaar hi unki manshaa par sawaal khadaa kar rahi he
 Jitan Ram Manjhi also said that 11 lakh liters of alcohol is still being produced in Bihar
 har roj mil rahi he sharabbihar ke sabhi jilon main har din sharaab kii khep pakadi ja rahi he
 This means that liquor is not banned in Bihar
 maanjhi ne kaha jab ghar se sharaab yaa sharaab kii bottle pakade jane par ghar ke mukhiya ko jail ho sakati he to jab bihar main sharaab pakadi ja rahi he or sharaab ban rahi he is sthiti main soobe ke mukhiya ko jail hona chahie
 On the opposition's attack and the threat of police association, JDU spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said that Bihar dgp's order was that the police station in the area will not be banned
 thanedaaron kaa ye nilamban usee tahat hua he
 Neeraj Kumar also says that it is his responsibility to follow the policies of the government and he cannot run away from this responsibility
 unhone kaha ki police mukhyalay dwaara kii gai karrwai par andolan kii dhamkee dena kahin se bhi uchit nahin he
 Explain that the police headquarters had suspended eleven Thanedars of Bihar for negligence in stopping the liquor business
 nae adhinium ke tahat ab in gyaarah thanedaaron kii agle das saal tak kisi thana main bataur thanedaar posting bhi nahin hogi
 The actions taken on these 11 are those which have fallen on eleven police stations

 In October 2007, a decision was taken through the cabinet through amendments to the Act to take care that an innocent person should not be unnecessarily harassed if found guilty in a case in the case that a false case has been made
 In that case action should be taken under Section 182 of the Indian Penal Code
 uttar pradesh main essi-asti act or dahej utpeedan act ke tahat tamaam farji maamle darj karne kii shikaayatein milti rahi hai
 The biggest thing is that after this amendment, the immediate arrest was also stopped in Uttar Pradesh after the FIR in 2007 itself
 act ke tahat darj sabhi exiaar par pehle vistrut vivechna ke baad hi karrwai sunishchit kii jaati thi jisase ye sandesh gaya ki sarkaar dalit utpeedan act ke tahat darj exiaar par karrwai karne se bachanaa chaahati he
 The instructions were given to stop misuse then on October 29, 2007, on behalf of the Chief Secretary Prashant Kumar in a letter sent to the Director General of Police, All Zonal Police Inspectors, All Zonal Police Deputy Inspectors General, All District Senior Superintendents of Police / Superintendents of Police
 It was directed that complete honesty should be exercised in observance of SC-ST Act

 On March 20, the Supreme Court issued a new guideline in the SC-ST Act on a Maharashtra case under which a ruling was passed to ban the misuse of the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes Act-1989
 isamen kaha gaya tha ki essi-asti act ke tahat exiaar darj hone ke baad aaropee kii tatkaal giraftaar nahin hogi
 The DSP level officer will first investigate the allegations
 yadi aarope sahi paae jate hai tabhi aage kii karrwai hogi

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PM Modi) on Tuesday started his election campaign in Bihar, targeting the Congress and other parties involved in the grand alliance
 pradhanmantri (PM Modi)ne khud ko 'chaikidaar' bataate hue kaha ki aaj is chaukeedaar se mahamilawat or unke pairokaar va aatankwaad or uske madadgaar pareshaan hai
 That is why they are abusing the watchman
 piem (PM Modi)ne kaha ki aatankwaad, bhrashtachar, naksalwad se nekaniyat vaali sarkaar hi muqabla kar sakati he
 Those who live for power cannot work in the national interest
 aarakshan ke mudde par piem ne kaha ki kai log daraane kaa kaam kar rahe hai, parantu koi bhi ise samaapt nahin kar saktaa
 Addressing an election rally at Gandhi Maidan in Gaya, Modi said that a lot was yet to be done
 unhone kaha ki jo log 70 saalon main satta main rahakar sabakuch kar lene kaa daawa nahin kar sakate, to main to paanch saal main sabakuch karne kaa daawa kaise kar saktaa hum
 But i have to make constant efforts, which needs your support
 piem ne logon se kaha ki desh main jo bhi vikaas kaa kaary sarkaar kar pai he, vah aap sabhi ke sahyog ke kaaran ho saki he
 Before 2014, bombings were carried out by terrorists in the country, but where did they go after 2014? pehle bhi yahi khufia vibhaag or police thi
 The Prime Minister countered Omar Abdullah's statement by saying that there could be no two Prime Ministers in this country
 unhone kaha ki kursi tantra ke liye milavati log aise aatankwaadiyon ko chhod dete the
 During this time he also took a dig at the Congress for 'hindu terrorism' and said, "the great leaders, including the Congress, played a fake game of Hindu terrorism for this to not be investigated properly
" virodhiyon ko hamaari chaukeedaari se dikkat hui to mahamilavati log chaukeedaar ko tarah-tarah kii gaali de rahe hai
 But the whole world is appreciating the work of the watchman
 piem ne 'mahagathbandhan' ko 'mahamilavati' bataate hue kaha ki ye log desh main aatankiyon, naksaliyon ko bhi badhaava dete hai
 When we guarded the conspiracies of such great people, they started getting into trouble
 chaukeedaar achche nahin lagane lage
 People with disabilities are hated by workers
 upi main avaidh boojadkhaane band karne kii muhim se meet kaarobaariyon main hadakamp much gaya he
 Before the election, the BJP had promised to close illegal slaughterhouses in the resolution letter
 yogi adityanath ke siem banate hi bijepi ke is vaade ko or majbootee mil gai he
 From election rallies to other public forums, Yogi Adityanath has been advocating the closure of slaughterhouses
 yahi vajah he ki ravivaar ko jaise hi yogi ne siem pad kii shapath lee uske baad boojadkhaanon par gaaj girani shuru ho gai
 Slaughterhouses are being sealed in different areas of UP
 haalanki sarkaar kii taraf se aupchaarik taur par is sambandh main koi aadesh nahin diya gaya he
 Closing illegal slaughterhouses in UP may be a matter for the BJP to fulfill the electoral issue
 lekin aisa hone se lakhon logon ke rojgaar kaa sankat bhi khadaa ho jayega
 According to a report, currently 40 slaughterhouses are legal in UP
 ye wo boojadkhaane hai jinhen centre sarkaar kii agricultural andprocessd food products export dawalpment athurity(apeda) se baqayada license mila hua he
 Whereas according to a report, the number of illegal slaughterhouses in UP is more than three and a half hundred
 bataa den ki upi desh main bhens ke meet kaa sabase bada niryaatak he
 Talking about the crisis in western UP, a large number of slaughterhouses are run in Meerut, Ghaziabad and Aligarh districts
 meerut shahar main hi vaid boojadkhaanon kii aad main bade paimaane par avaidh boojadkhaane chalaae ja rahe hai
 Thousands of people are employed in these illegal slaughterhouses
 aise main agar ye boojadkhaane band kar die jate hai to badi taadaad main logon par rojgaar kaa sankat paidaa ho jayega
 Action is being taken to close illegal slaughterhouses in Varanasi also in Sankat Varanasi
 varanasi ke jaitpura ilaake main mangalvaar ko police ne ek avaidh boojadkhana band karaayaa
 a large number of people are also connected to the abattoirs here
 kareeb 15 hajaar logon kaa rojgaar boojadkhaanon se judaa he
 Most of these people are those who have been doing the work of cutting meat from the books
 aise main is kaam ke alaava unke paas rojgaar kaa vikalp bachataa najar nahin aata he
 Asarkanpur is considered the economic capital of UP on the leather trade
 kanpur se sabade bada kaarobaar chamade kaa hota he
 Leather belts to bags and shoes are made in Kanpur
 deshbhar main kaccha chamada bhi kanpur se jaataa he
 About $ 12 billion worth of leather goods is exported from Kanpur to foreign countries every year
 yahaan sirf 6 boojadkhaane vaid hai jabaki avaidh boojadkhaanon kii sankhya pachaas se zyada he
 About 50 crore meat trade is done daily from Kanpur alone
 kisaanon par asarboochdakhaanon ko band karne kaa faisla sirf kaarobaariyon yaa mazdooron ko hi prabhavit nahin karegaa
 It will also have a wider impact on farmers
 2012 ke pashudhan jansankhya ke anusaar upi main bhens or gaay kii taadaad main baari ijapha hua he
 The number of buffaloes increased by 28 percent compared to 2007 while the number of cows increased by 10 percent
 bina doodh vaali gaay or bhens ko paalna kisaan ke liye badi chunauti hoti he
 Generally, farmers keep the same cattle which are either used for farming or are milch
 baaki duusare maweshiyon ko kisaan bech dete hai
 Feeding such cattle is also considered a major crisis for farmers
 yahaan band hue boojadkhanapulice prashasan ne avaidh boojadkhaane band karaane shuru kar die hai
 On Monday, when police arrived to close an illegal meat shop in Gajraula, the shopkeeper tried to burn himself by adding kerosene
 haalanki police ne use turant daboch liya
 After this, two slaughterhouses were sealed in Allahabad on Tuesday
 jabaki gajiabad ke kelaa bhatta ilaake main police ne 15 boojadkhaane band karaae
 Closure of illegal child labor in UP will have a major impact on the public
 aise main yogi adityanath ko apane chunavi vaade puure karne ke saath is kadam se prabhavit janata ke liye rojgaar ke vikalp bhi talashne honge

 He said that Ghani was the last hope for peace in the region
 musharraf ne kaha, ‘ab raashtrapati ashraf gani aae hai or vah afghanistan main phir se santulan kaayam karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 We should definitely cooperate with them
 ’purv sainya shaasha ne kaha, ‘pakistan ke apane log the, bharat ke apane log the jo acha nahin he
 i accept it
 yah acchhee baat nahin he
 It is not in the interest of Afghanistan, Pakistan or India
 ise ruknaa chahie
 'he said,' Raw of India, Pakistan's ISI has always been fighting against each other since our independence

 It should stop, but it will stop only when the leadership of both sides show the will to resolve the dispute and compromise by stopping the confrontation

 darasal, bhootpurv pradhanmantri ke hatyaron ko 'kaum ke heere' bataane vaali yah film shuukravaar, 22 agast ko release hone ja rahi he
 Vikramjit Singh, the president of the youth wing of the opposition party Congress in the state, has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi warning of state-wide protests in the event that the film's release is not stopped, while a member of the ruling alliance's constituent BJP in the state This is what is demanded

 It is noteworthy that four months after the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allowed military action (called 'operation Bluestar') to expel the terrorists from the gurdwara - the Golden Temple - considered to be the holiest of Sikhs in June 1984
 On October 31, 1984, his bodyguards Satwant Singh and Beant Singh killed him by firing bullets
 is film 'kaum de heere' (samudaay ke heere) kii kahani 'oparation bluestar' se shuru hoti he, or satvant singh kii faansee par khatm hoti he
 It is noteworthy that Beant Singh was killed by the other bodyguards of Indira Gandhi immediately after the shots were fired on the occasion
 indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad deshbhar main sikh-virdohi dange bhadak gaye the, jinamein lagbhag 3,000 sikh maar die gaye the
 The Shiromani Akali Dal-backed Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee honored Satwant Singh and Beant Singh as 'martyrs' during an event last year, which was widely criticized
 aalochakon ke anusaar is film main bhi hatyaron kaa mahimamandan kiya gaya he
 BJP leader and former minister Laxmikant Chawla said, "even such films should not be allowed to be made
 
 
 main nahin jaanata, sensor board ne ise kaise paas kar diya
 
 
 Indira Gandhi was our Prime Minister
 
 
 unke hatyaron kaa mahimamandan kiye jane se na sirf punjab main shanti or sadbhaav ko nuksaan hoga, balki puure uttar bharat main
 
 
 Such films should be banned
 
 
 " Actually, the film had been facing opposition for several months, but it was allowed to be released after the producers approved some of the cuts made by the censor board

 There is hardly anyone who would not know how dangerous drinking alcohol can be to health
 par ekbar jab sharaab pine kii lat lag jaati he to use chhod paanaa bahut hi mushkil ho jaataa he
 Many times a person wants to give up this dirty habit but he does not have control over himself
 kisi bhi nashe ko lat banane main vakt nahin lagata he or phir ek samay aisa aata he jab insaan isaki changul main funskar til-til kar marane lagata he
 In such a situation, it is most important that you overcome your addiction
 haalanki kai aise maamle hai jinamein logon ne is buree aadat par jeet pai he lekin itnaa jarur he ki iske liye bahut adhik sanyam or dhairya kii jarurat hoti he
 In many cases, people themselves have overcome the addiction of alcohol, but there are many cases in which they have left this with the help of doctors
 bazaar main kai aisi davaaiyaan maujuud hai jo ye daawa karti hai ki unke istemaal se nashe kii lat chhot jaati he
 But there are many cases in which failure has been found
 agar aapako bhi sharaab ke nashe kii lat he to sabase pehle aapako khud ko sakaraatmak banane kii jarurat he
 You may take lakhs of medicines or medical advice, but unless you are strong in mind, you cannot do anything
 jab bhi aapako sharaab kii lat sataae, aap ye upaay apana sakate hai:1
 Try to indulge yourself in some other work, this is a very effective and reliable solution
 agar aapako sharaab pine kii talab mahasoos ho rahi he to sabase pehle khud ko kisi duusare kaam main uljhane kii koshish kiijie
 If you want, you can go for a walk in a nearby park, read a book or take exercise
 2
 Spend time with your loved ones if you take help from your loved ones to quit alcohol addiction, it will be better
 jab bhi aapako sharaab pine kii lat mahasoos ho apano ke bich baith jaaie or unke saath samay bitaane kii koshish kiijie
 Gradually your self will start to grow and you will move towards a better life
 3
 There is also a lot of times by taking sugar in extra quantity, the people do not understand the difference between the call of alcohol and the desire to eat sugar
 aise main agar aapako sharaab pine kii lat mahasoos ho rahi ho to aap kisi sugar drink kaa bhi sahaara le sakate hai
 4
 nishchit antaraal par khanise tarah kii samasya se jujhane vaale zyaadaatar logon kaa kahana he ki jab ve bhukhe hote hai to unhen sharaab pine kii talab zyada mahasoos hoti he
 In such a situation, before the addiction of drinking alcohol dominates you, try to never empty your stomach
 iske alaava pratidin ke hisaab se 6 se 8 gilaas pani pinaa bhi bahut jaruri he

 30 november 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india today When the Delhi High Court ruled in favor of LGBTQ rights in 2009, a week later i was preparing to shoot the film i Am
 so, maine us faisle ke hisaab se kahani main thodaa pherbadal kar diya
 But when i reached the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), i was asked to cut a 21-minute episode from a 23-minute episode involving gay rights in the film
 ye kuch is tarah the, "are, do ge ek-duusare ko romantic najaron se dekh rahe the
 How is this being tolerated? ”but we were adamant that the law was in our favor
 phir 2017 main main film shab lekar sibiefasi gaya to unhone tippanee kii, "aapane to inako normal dikhaa diya

 bataur kalakaar, main pehle hi samjhauta kar rahaa tha kyonki maine ve antarrashtriya drishy nahin dikhaae jinamein ge trek hon
 Finally, film certification appellate tribunal visits twice and u / a certificate six months later
 jab maine nae faisle ko suna to kuch pal to meri ankhon main aansu aa gaye, main cheekh padaa kyonki 2013 ke faisle ke baad mujhe ye din dekhne kii sari ummiden tut chuki thim
 i started thinking that now i might not have to censor myself
 bataur kalakaar main ab is par samjhauta nahin karuunga ki apni birdari ko kaise dikhaaun
 This decision has also given me strength not to drink insults silently
 main ishwar kaa shukriya adaa karata hum ki supreme court vaisaa loklubhaavan najariya nahin rakhata, jiskaa doshi hamaara filmodyog he, na sirf ge birdari ke maamle main balki auraton ke maamle main bhi vah tang nazariye kaa shikaar he
 There is dominance of hatred of gays and lack of social awareness
 kuch din pehle hi main is faisle ko dhyaan main rakhkar ek tivi channel se shab dikhaane ke liye gidgidaa rahaa tha, aap itani sari filmein dikhaate ho, is choti-si film ke liye mauka nahin nikaal sakate? yah sochakar meraa dil baith jaataa he ki meri film duniya bhar main gum ai par mere apane hi desh main use nahin dikhaaya ja sakaa
 As a gay filmmaker, i did not suffer any discrimination in the film industry except for the nonsense of CBFC
 meri film maai brother nikhil ko bina kisi kaat-chhaant ke shyuy certificate mila tha

 69 (vot pratishat main) When Union Minister and Fatehpur MP Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti was asked about the death of NIA officer Tanjil Ahmed on Wednesday, he refused to know Tanjil Ahmed and turned Tanjil into Pakistani
 iske baad jab unhen apni galati kaa ahsaas hua, to wo tarah-tarah ke tark dene lageen
 Pakistan is told by Tanjil Ahmed that every person is shocked at the death of NIA officer Tanjil Ahmad and whose wife is fighting a war between life and death
 use hi hamaare desh ke netaa jaanate tak nahin hai
 Union Minister and Fatehpur MP Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, who made media headlines for her disputed statements, refused to know Tanjil when she spoke to Tanjeel Ahmed while speaking to media in up's Fatehpur and called him Pakistani
 jab hua galati kaa ahsassadhvi ne kaha ki wo tanzeel ahamed ke maamle main pataa karke baat karengi
 After this, when the Sadhvi realized her mistake, she cited the workload of rectifying the mistake
 sadhvi niranjan ne kaha ki main raajnneeti main jarur hum, lekin ghar raat ko der se pahunchati hum
 Can't find time to read newspapers and watch TV

 Keswani raised the question in the conversation till date, 'have the Indian investigative agencies verified the documents? Are these real documents? ' He said that it is better if we do not talk about Indian investigative agencies
 kesavani kaa kahana he ki agar pakistan ne is sabooton ko khaarij kar diya to daaud ko ap kaisepakad paaenge

 There is nothing new in this, but it remains a mystery to all of us
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘aap sabhi jaanate hai ki kootneeti main kaaphi kuch sankethik hota he, khaskar hamaare uttari padosi ke saath
 This may be part of a clue in my mind, but I'm not going to speculate on what it actually means
 ’baharhaal unhone spasht kiya ki bharat ‘jameen kaa koi tukdaa nahin chhodane vaala he
 'raha attributed the different views on the actual situation of the two countries along the Line of Actual Control to the repeated confrontation of the Indian and Chinese military

 Raha said, 'these bases are strategically important to us and will enhance our capabilities
 ’ unhone kaha, purvottar main 6 or vaayu sena addon kaa apgredation kiya ja rahaa he or yah kaam 2015 ke ant tak puraa ho jayega
 Raha said that this would enable the Air Force to operate fixed wing aircraft for immediate movement of security forces from there
 
 
 
 So, was Sant Kabir standing in the market and therefore asking everyone well
 
 
 ? kya unhen pataa tha ki ek din aisa aayega, jab bazaar main aam aadmi 'daal' tak kharidne ke liye taras jayega
 Did he know that only Kanda would turn away from the plate of kanda-roti-eating society
 
 
 or kya unhen ilm tha ki bazaar kii shaktiyaan ek din garib kaa galaa dabaane par utaaru ho jaaengi or yah sab kuch un dinon main hoga, jinhen ham 'achche dinon' ke rup main nirupit karenge
 Today, when we consider Kabir's efforts to stand in the market and seek the well-being of all, we see the helpless face of India progressing in the digital, smart and global scenario, which has everything in priority, except dal roti and Of Kanda
 ham soch bhi nahin sakate the ki garibon ke liye protein kaa sabase bada jariya daal ek din 200 rupee kilo bikegi, pyaaj kaa itihaas ham dekh hi chuke hai
 Onion has played its part in spoiling the images of the governments, so we have now accepted its successive 'trickery' as its destiny, but now pulses
 
 
 daal kii mahangaai ke sandarbh main tamaam vishleshan aa chuke hai
 Stories ranging from its production to storage and the news of imported pulses being sent to the electoral states to save the electoral riots have also been printed from every reasonable angle, but the big question is that what the common people need is only on things Why is the biggest planned attack happening? 
 
 ? Isn't it becoming a story every year that onion prices will be out of our control after a while, can our policymakers not keep a proper account of the needs of the common people, keep a record of product, demand and supply, or In such circumstances, a quick plan cannot provide relief
 kya hamen desh par sankat keval isi rup main dikhaai detaa he ki padosi rajya hamaari simaaon par hamalaa kar dete hai, lekin bazaar kii nirih takatein jab is rup main logon kaa khun kar detii hai ki vah behate hue dikhaai bhi nahin detaa, tab kya hamen uskaa dard mahasoos hota he
 Probably not, so every year we silently watch the price rise of certain food items, vegetables, grains and shamelessly issue a statement that now the prices will come under control only when a new crop arrives
 darasal daal ke dard ko vahi mahasoos kar saktaa he, jisane ek vakt kii daal kisi parchun kii dukaan se kharidi ho yaa kisi or ko kharidte hue dekha ho
 Yes, it is the people of the same society who spend a day below 25 or 32 rupees and if their house ever accidentally becomes pulses in the current era, then they rise directly above the poverty line
 nahin uthte to ve log, jo kanda-daal-sabji jaisi chijen ugane kaa dussahas karte hai
 a terrible society is ours and strange is its circumstances
 ek ore iske utpaadan main lage karj se laden log saal-dar-saal marate jate hai, duusari ore kuch log inke abhaav main mar jate hai
 Do you not be surprised to find that the time when onion is being sold for 60 rupees per kg, at the same time, the farmer who returned home after selling onion from the market dies by drinking poison because he did not get the right price in the market, and with that much money He is unable to repay the debt
 kya is samay kii yah ek traasadee nahin he ki kisaan or kisaani ke sawaal hamaare vimarsh se gaayab hai, jo sidhe taur par aisi vastuon ke utpaadan se jude hai
 Why in this market the farmer himself does not decide the price of his produce, what are his compulsions or made
 goyaa petrol-dijal jaise utpaadon ko jab bazaar ke hawaale kar diya jaataa he or antarrashtriya bazaar main jab unki keemten kinhin bhi kaarnon se kam ho jaati hai, tab bazaar raahat dene kaa apana vaada puraa kyon nahin karata
 
 
 The Why does Kabir's market take other criteria for such people
 aapako yah baaten thodi puraani lag sakati hai, manoj kumaar kii deshbhakti film kii tarah hi, lekin baar-baar kii ghatnaon or paristhitiyon se yah lagata he ki kalabazari jaise shabd dictionari se villopit nahin hue hai, balki ve nae-nae paryaayon ke saath hamaare saamne lalachaai najaron se hajir ho rahe hai, bazaar ko apane manmutabik chalaane vaale unke nae arth or rachanaaen garh rahe hai
 This doubt is now turning into trust
 jaise-jaise daal or us jaisi chijen or mahangi hongi, yah vaise-vaise or badhata jayega
 i want to clear one more thing and give a notice while finishing this blog
 pehla yah ki main bazaar ke khilaaf nahin hum
 Like Kabir, i also want to stand in the market, but only when he does not behave brutally
 
 
 kam se kam jivan jeene ke sansadhano ke saath nahin
 Okay, i don't want cheese, crores of people like me will live without it, but Kanda Roti and Dal are my needs, have mercy
 
 
 
 And information is that the well has been dug in Madhya Pradesh on fire
 raaton-raat daal niyantran act banane kii taiyaari ho gai he
 Come on, the government admitted that there was something wrong
 vah isliye nahin ki utpaadan ghat gaya he, balki isliye ki puraa utpaadan kahin ek jagah he
 You can expect that something good will happen in 'good days', because it has now been proved that Hindustan enjoys more hope than dal

 Am personally touched by Nawaz Sharif Sahab 's gesture of welcoming me at Lahore airport and coming to the airport when i left

 He recalled their interactions & asked me to convey his regards to Atal ji
 Spent a warm evening with Sharif family at their family home
 Nawaz Sahab's birthday & granddaughter's marriage made it a double celebration Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Saturday accused the farmers of not getting the right price for their crops and claimed that due to the policies of the BJP government, the farmers of the country are forced to celebrate 'kali Deepawali' today
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki sarkaar kaa ''asli rajdharm'' yah he ki kisaanon ko unki upaj kaa uchit mulya mili
 Sonia said in a statement, "the BJP government laid the foundation of deception as soon as it took power
 usne kisaanon ko laagat ke saath 50 fisadi kaa munafa samarthan mulya ke taur par dene kaa vaada kiya tha
 But year after year, the BJP government continued to benefit a handful of middlemen and hoarders and loot millions of crores of rupees from the Annadata farmers
 ''unhone kaha, '' sawaal yah he ki deepawali ke tyohaar ke din kisaan kaali deepawali manaane ko majaboor kyon hai? desh kii vibhinn mandiyon main kharif fasalein samarthan mulya se aath fisadi se lekar 37 fisadi tak kam par bik rahi hai
 That is, the average selling price of Kharif crops is 22 times the support price
 5 phisadi kam he
 "he asked," Total foodgrain production 1405 in Kharif 2019-20
 7 karod ton anumaanit he
 In the mandis the yield is 22 on average from the support price
 5 fisadi kam kii dar par bik rahi he, usase desh ke kisaanon ko lagbhag 50 hajaar karod rupee kaa nuksaan hoga
 Who will compensate for this? "congress interim president Sonia Gandhi claimed," More concern in the future is to determine the support price for the Rabi crops of the year 2020-21 as the BJP government has compared Rabi crops to previous years
 It has increased by only four to seven percent
 ''unhone aarope lagaaya, " kisaanon ko fasalon ke sahi daam nahin mil rahe hai or kheti ke utpaadon kaa niryaat ghat rahaa he
 Farmers are being hit twice
 " sonia ne kaha,'' congress kii maang he ki desh ke kisaan kaa yah doharaa shoshan band ho or unhen apane parishram kaa sahi mulya mili

 The MCD has rejected the Delhi government's proposal to impose parking fees in residential areas

 Obviously the biggest problem at present is parking
 aise main beete kai maheenon se dilli kii nai parking policy ko lekar charchaaen chal rahi hai
 The Lieutenant Governor had sought suggestions from the Delhi Government, MCD and RWA who are directly connected with the public, after which all have sent suggestions to the Lieutenant Governor
 dilli sarkaar ke transport vibhaag ne is masaude main awasaiya kshetra main parking karne par charge lagane kaa suzav diya he
 At the same time, it is also proposed to increase the charge on parking in roads and streets
 jabaki, dilli nagar nigam aam janata ko raahat dene ke mood main najar aa rahi he
 In the proposal sent to the Lieutenant Governor, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation has said that there should be no charge for erecting the car outside the house
 dakshini dilli nagar nigam ke dipti meyar kailash sankhla ke mutabik ham apane ilaake main rahane vaale kisi bhi vyakti par atirikt shulk kaa bhaar nahin daalana chaahate hai
 Therefore, the MCD has rejected the Delhi government's proposal

 The government will decide how many vehicles can be registered in each house

 Rajiv says that only the parking in residential areas will not improve the parking system
 sarkaar tay karen ki kis ghar main kitni gaadiyaan hon or agar parking kii vyavastha naa ho to registration naa kiya jaae
 However, parking experts say that imposing parking tax outside the house is not a solution to the problem, for this a multilevel parking hub will have to be built on every area
 jaahir he dilli waalon ko nai policy se parking main raahat milane kii badi ummid he
