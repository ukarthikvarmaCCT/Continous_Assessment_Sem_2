 unhone kaha, ‘chayankarta bhartiya cricket ke bhavishya ko dhyaan main rakh kar team kaa chayan nahin karte balki kuch gata yaa badhaakar santulan banane kaa prayaas karte hai
 Ganguly was also surprised that Laxman said in the press conference that he could not talk to his captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 ganguli ne kaha, ‘captain ko 24 ghante uplabdh hona chaiye
 Don't know why Dhoni did this
 mujhe lagata he ki lakshmana ko agar dhoni kaa samarthan mil jaataa to sthiti kuch or ho sakati thi

 This was a major headline for the draft Kashmir talks held in early 2007
 iske shabdon par donon pakshon ne sheersh str par anumati or sahmati, donon hi de di thi, bas hastakshar hone baaki the
 At the same time, the then President Pervez Musharraf suspended the Chief Justice of Pakistan, demonstrations started on the streets, the situation started to go awry
 is sabase beparwaah musharraf ne apane bharosemand dost or parade ke peeche vaarta doot tarik ajij ke jariye sandesh bheja, ''bas ek hafte yaa 10 din kii baat he, sab kaabo main aa jayega
 a week later the message came again, "two more weeks
" ” isse pehle ki koi kuch samaj paata, vah samay nikal gaya
 Seven years later, India's decision to cancel foreign secretary-level talks between the two countries seems to have lost that chance again
 isse badi saavdhaanee se likhe gaye kashmir vaarta ke masaude ke buniyadi sach saamne aane kaa khatra paidaa ho gaya he
 Currently, the reason for canceling the talks seems to be the decision of the Pakistani High Commissioner to meet Hurriyat leaders before the Foreign Secretary talks
 lekin asal main yah silsilaa bijepi ke netritv main endie ke sansadeey chunaav jeetne or satta main aane se pehle hi 30 april ko shuru ho gaya tha
 On that day, Pakistan Army Chief General Raheel Sharif said in his traditional address at the Army Headquarters on Martyr's Day that Kashmir had been Pakistan's 'sore throat' and that the decades-old dispute should be resolved in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions
 is bayaan par nai dilli main bhaunhen tanana swaabhaavik tha kyonki aisa laga ki ve pakistan kii ore se kiye gaye pramukh vaade se peeche hat rahe hai
 At what time this statement was made, it was not difficult for India to understand
 asal main usee samay is masaude main kiye gaye ek or pramukh vaade—niyantran rekha par sangharsh viraam ke paalan—kii dhajjiyaan udaakar baar-baar ulanghan ho rahe the
 As far as Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is concerned, it seems history is repeating itself
 unki sena bharat ke saath shanti samjhaute kii koshishon ko palitha lagaati dikh rahi he
 Sharif raised hopes by accepting India's invitation to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 unke liye yah faisla aasaan nahin tha kyonki bharat ne agra main asafal shikhar sammelan kii ghatnaon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue halaat kaabo main rakhane ke liye kuch sharten bhi bheji thim
 The first condition was that the visit be seen as a symbol of participation in an event rather than an opportunity for formal bilateral dialogue
 duusare, koi badi ghoshnaa yaa sanyukt vijyapti jari nahin hogi
 Apart from this, there will be no dialogue that will distract attention from the main event i
e
 there will be no joint press conference nor the custom of meeting Hurriyat leaders
 pakistan ne sochane ke liye samay liya, lekin jab ek baar sharif ne nimantran sweekaar kar liya to apana vaada nibhaayaa
 Sharif issued just plain press statements and had no contact with the Hurriyat in particular
 sarkaar ne samajha ki usne is maamle main nai misaal kaayam kar di he
 But Pakistan's High Commissioner Abdul Basit sent a letter to Hurriyat leaders on 17 August inviting him to discuss before the Foreign Secretary talks on 25 August
 is par bharat ke satta pratishthan main tikhi pratikriya hui
 There were lengthy phone calls between Modi and senior ministers — Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley
 inamen sangharsh viraam ke badhate ulanghan se lekar jammu-kashmir main chunavi sambhaavnaaon tak tamaam mudde uthe
 But the real uneasiness was that Pakistan was discussing with separatist groups in India, while the new government had not yet raised the subject with it
 18 agast ko dopaher tak faisla ho gaya or videsh mantralay ko iske bare main suchit kar diya gaya
 But ministry officials suggested that the government could ask the Pakistani authorities to cancel the meeting, warning of the consequences, as happened during Sharif's visit
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj maan gayi or sidhe modi se baat kii, jinhone apni sahmati jataa di
 Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh told Basit over phone that if she met Hurriyat leaders she would not be able to go to Islamabad
 bataaya jaataa he ki basit ne jawaab main kaha ki aisi mulaakaaten hameshaa hoti rahi hai or isse bharat ko andruni halaat main madad milegi
 To this Sujatha Singh retorted and replied, "we are capable of handling our internal situation
" ”or phir yah ghoshnaa ho gai ki pakistan ke saath vaarta radd kar di gai he
 (syed Ali Shah Geelani) Sharif vs Sharif, when Pakistan's Army Chief General Raheel Sharif was at the threshold of Jawani when his brother Shabbir Sharif was killed in the 1971 war
 jab ve shok manaa rahe the, tabhi unke bhai ke ek saathi ne kareeb aakar kaha ki aisa kabhi na sochen ki unka bhai nahin rahaa
 He assured Raheel that he should consider him as his elder brother
 ve saathi parvej musharraf the or pakistani sena main sab jaanate hai ki musharraf hameshaa raahil sharif ke kariyar main chattan kii tarah unke saath rahe
 After taking commission in the army in 1976, General Sharif stepped in very easily
 unhen acchhee-se-acchhee niyukti or videsh main prashikshan ke maukey mili
 When Musharraf became army chief, Raheel was the only brigadier who would get an appointment while senior officers were waiting for him
 parvej musharraf ke raashtrapati banane par bhi yah sthiti kaayam rahi
 So when Prime Minister Sharif decided to accuse Musharraf of treason, old relations came in the way
 general raahil ne pradhanmantri sharif kaa virodh kiya or vahiin se sambandh gadabada gaye
 Suddenly Maulvi Tahirul Qadri has taken to the streets with Imran Khan carrying a crowd of people
 unka aarope he ki pichley saal chunaav main dhaandhlee hui thi
 Within a year, the political future of Nawaz Sharif, who came to power with a majority, seems to be in danger
 vaarta radd karne kaa modi kaa faisla unki saakh par ek or batta he
 It seems that General Raheel's loyalty to Musharraf does not apply to the Kashmir negotiations that his patron had drawn with India through his clever mediator and friend Tariq Aziz
 vidambnaa to yah he ki pradhanmantri sharif ko us baatcheet main dam najar aayaa, jise pakistan main sarkaar badalane ke baavjood chamatkaarik dhang se jinda rakhaa gaya
 Reliable sources have revealed that even when India was preparing for elections this year, behind the scenes many meetings were held between Sharif's envoy Shaharyar Khan and India's envoy Satinder Lamba
 samajha jaataa he ki pakistan maan gaya tha ki donon ore kii kashmir niti kii rajnatik simaaon ko dekhte hue donon desh isi masaude par sahamat ho sakate hai
 Like any effort between India and Pakistan, this time too the bottleneck was soon felt
 is baar yah adnga 30 april ko senadhyaksh ke bhaashan ke rup main saamne aayaa
 (mirwaiz Umar Farooq) Draft Kashmir Dialogue Six messengers spent nearly 250 hours in about 30 meetings for a decade to prepare the draft of the dialogue and keep it alive till date
 inamen se kuch mulaakaaten dubai, kathmandu, colombo or bangkok jaise shaharon main hui
 Brajesh Mishra, Tariq Aziz, J

 Dixit, Satinder Lamba, Riyaz Mohammad Khan and now Shaharyar Khan acted as intermediaries and each of them had direct contact with their Prime Minister or President

 mishra or pakistan ke purv videsh sachiv niaj nayak ko is anaupchaarik sampark kii raah kholane kii jimmedaari di gai thi
 Nayak was brutally murdered in Islamabad five years ago

 This required a major reshuffle in the area and the subsequent moderates called it communal as well
 yah prakriya atal bihari vaajapeyi ke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar brajesh mishra or parvej musharraf ke kaarykaal main pakistan kii rashtriya suraksha parishad ke sachiv tarik ajij ke bich shuru hui thi
 Both worked hard to resume the dialogue after the 2001 attack on India's Parliament
 isi hamale ke baad bhartiya sena ko lamaband kiya gaya tha
 His biggest success was that Vajpayee went to Islamabad for the SAARC summit in January 2004
 donon paksh is baat par sahamat hue ki sthaayee samaadhaan hone tak niyantran rekha par sangharsh viraam kaa paalan hoga
 Aziz remained the main link of this contact even after Vajpayee was out of power

 Musharraf enlisted in the army and Aziz joined the Revenue Service of Pakistan
 donon kii dosti chalati rahi or musharraf ke raashtrapati banane par ajij unke vishwast or sabase achche salaahkaar ho gaye
 At that time Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made his position very clear that he does not have the mandate to change the borders of India, but he can work in the direction that borders like the Line of Control become irrelevant
 bharat ne yah rukh apanaaya jis par shuru main pakistan ne thodi thandi pratikriya di
 Pakistan was keen to agree three big things — extending sovereignty to the Kashmir Valley, incorporating Siachen and some reshuffling of borders
 bharat chahta tha ki pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir or gilgit tathaa blatistan sahit samooche kashmir ko samjhaute ke daayre main laayaa jaae
 Eventually Pakistan agreed and the doors of further dialogue opened
 antat: sari charchaa samprabhutaa par simat gai, kyonki siachin ko parade ke peeche kii baatcheet se hataa liya gaya or seemaa ke masale ko rajnatik majaburiyon kii vajah se alag rakh diya gaya
 Reliable sources told India Today that it was because of this delicate negotiation that the idea of joint management of the region which Pakistan wanted to include defense and law and order
 bharat ne inkaar kar diya lekin vyapak vichaar ko nahin choda
 This proved to be the biggest achievement for Pakistan
 donon paksh bharat-pakistan sanyukt tantra banane par sahamat hue jiske jariye vyapaar, swasthya, shiksha, dharmasthalon kii yatra or samskruti jaise prashasan ke muddon main pakistan kaa dakhal ho saktaa tha lekin suraksha main nahin
 The structure of this system was to be decided later but originally it was given as a 10-15 member advisory body, which was to meet at least twice a year
 isamen donon pakshon kii ore se kashmiri pratinidhi ho sakate the to nirvaachit pratinidhi bhi shaamil kiye jane the
 That is, it fueled Musharraf's four-point formula
 lekin samprabhutaa ke muddon par jabardast baatcheet chali
 Pakistan kept pressuring India that its currency should be legalized in the valley
 bharat nahin mana, lekin yatra permit ko manyata dene par taiyaar tha
 In return, Pakistan agreed to abide by the UN resolutions and abandon the referendum
 is tarah ke prayaas ko gupt rakhana behad jaruri tha
 At one point Lamba and Aziz felt that meeting at different locations would not work unless they were completely hidden
 in shaharon kaa chunaav shaayad isliye kiya gaya tha kyonki donon deshon se vahaan tak sidhi udaanen thim
 (shabbir Shah) Highly secretive Ajij was particularly concerned because his absence from Islamabad for a long time could get into the public eye which could raise questions
 isi vajah se dubai sabase pasandida thikaana bana
 The two mediators arrived in the morning, talked for a while and returned that night
 in yatraaon ke liye donon shaayad hi kabhi apane duutavaason ko suchit karte the
 Sources said that they used to travel like tourists
 booking kisi kaarobaari travel agency ke jariye hoti thi
 She used to arrange for the car at the airport
 hotel pahunchane ke baad hi donon ek duusare se sampark saadhaa karte the
 Apart from the conversations, decisions were only given in these meetings as the mediators avoided the use of telephone, mobile or internet
 bataaya jaataa he ki baad main donon ne apane-apane code tay kar liye the
 Amritsar meant yes and Lahore means no
 kisi bhi halchal yaa faisle kii soochna dene ke liye donon esemes main badi chaturaai se in shabdon kaa upyog karte the
 When the negotiations took shape, both mediators felt that the ISI should also be linked to this process as it was impossible to proceed without its approval
 isi vajah se iesai ke mahanideshak le
 General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani studied every aspect of the proposed draft closely
 musharraf ke baad senadhyaksh bane kayaani ko kuch aapattiyaan bhi thim jinka samaadhaan kiya gaya
 Sources reveal that the final draft went ahead only after the approval of ISI chief Kayani
 kayaani kaa doglapanbataya jaataa he ki varrta kaa praaroop tay hone ke baad manmohan singh ne madhyasthon ko yah jimmedaari bhi saunpi ki 2007 main pakistan kii unki sambhavit yatra or uske sambhavit nateezon ke bare main vipakshi netaaon ko chuninda jaankaree dene kii prakriya shuru karen
 At the same time negotiations were going on with the US on the nuclear deal and questions were raised as to whether it would have to be approved by Parliament despite the Kashmir accord being within the scope of the parliamentary proposals
 november, 2007 main senadhyaksh banane ke baad kayaani ne apni soch badal lee or asif ali jaradaari ke shasankaal main deal ko aage badhaane main ve pramukh baadha sabit hue
 This is best recorded in the wikileaks cable (08 London 2968) issued by the US Embassy in London
 isamen british rajanyik laura hiki kaa hawala diya gaya he jo us samay videsh or rashtramandal karyaalay main pakistani dal kii mukhiya thim
 This cable dates back to the time when the then Foreign Minister David Miliband visited Pakistan
 ''hiki ne bataaya ki miliband ne is yatra ke dauraan nateeja nikaala ki ab kashmir par samajhaita ho hi janaa chahie
 Zardari and Manmohan Singh were ready and drafted on paper
 miliband ko laga ki ek hi baadha bachi thi or ve the pakistan ke senadhyaksh general kayaani
 They were condescending and needed to be persuaded
 ”islamabad main miliband kii mulaakaaten 25 november, 2008 ko ho rahi thim
 On 26 November, the attackers stole a trawler and were going to Mumbai
 agle 48 ghanton main rajnatik paridrishy badal gaya or parade ke peeche kaa samvaad kareeb do saal ke liye thanda pad gaya
 In his last few months, Modi's unfinished beginnings, Mohan Singh, had instructed his staff that whatever happened behind the scenes on Kashmir should be recorded as much as possible in a folder for the next Prime Minister
 pichley maheene kisi samay modi ne vah foulder kholaa, jaankaree maangi or tab se is vishay par soch-vichaar kar rahe hai
 One of the reasons for the government's decision could also be the latest proposal from Pakistan that Kashmir should be removed from the issues discussed by the Foreign Secretaries and it should be discussed separately among the Foreign Ministers
 pakistan bharat kii chintaaon ko dur karne ke liye is samvaad main aatankwaad ko bhi shaamil karne ko taiyaar he
 In fact, the government had to decide whether to reconnect behind the scenes or make Kashmir a matter of formal dialogue
 isaki bajaae sarkaar algaavvaadi sanghathan hurriyat ke maamle main ulajh gai jabaki yah mudda bahut shuru main hi parade ke peeche kii baatcheet main tay ho chukaa tha
 India rejected Pakistan's suggestion to include Kashmiri representatives and placed a condition that it would be an agreement between the two sides only
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki uske daayre ke baahar jo kuch hua, vah sirf dikhaava tha
 The modi-nda government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, by canceling foreign secretary-level talks with Pakistan because of Pakistan's contact with the Hurriyat, blurred this essential achievement which was crucial to the complex peace process layer-by-layer

 The media has treated me like a criminal

 Amar Singh was in Mumbai Kolkata for the last several days during a fierce battle in the socialist family
 vahiin se wo har din badalte ghatnakram par najar banaae hue the or media se bachate gum rahe the
 He did not speak much on this entire Crisis
 isse pehle akhilesh yadav or ramgopal yadav ne amar singh ko is puure jhagade ke liye jimmedaar mana tha
 But Amar Singh did not react to this
 jabaki mulaayam singh ne kaha tha ki vah amar singh ko nahin chhod sakate
 Since then, Amar Singh also refrained from speaking on the controversy
 dilli pahunchane ke baad bhi unhone yahi kaha ki jab mulaayam singh ji bol chuke hai
 There is no point in speaking after that and Mulayam Singh is also the father of Akhilesh and the father of the Samajwadi Party
 isliye un se badhkar koi nahin he
 When he has said his word, then there is nothing left to say after that
 amar singhb kuch din tak dilli main rahenge
 It will be interesting to see how long Amar Singh, who often talks to the media, will keep a distance from the media on the scandal in the Samajwadi Party

 congress netaa digvijay singh ne sidhi baat main kaha ki, piem modi kaa kariyar ab dhalaan par he
 Who will know them after 10 years? Digvijay said this on the question in which he was asked that you do not remember the time when you were the only biggest name from the Congress in Madhya Pradesh
 aaj se 10 saal baad modi ko koun jaanegaa?congress netaa digvijay singh ne kaha, 'politics main koi iklauta rahata he kya? raajnneeti kaa paridrishy teji se badalata he
 Who knew Modi ji 10 years ago
 keval siem ke taur par janaa jaataa tha

 'adwani kii ore dekhte tak nahin modidigvijay singh ne aage kaha, 'aap murali manohar joshi se baat kar lijie
 He was the chairman of the BJP manifesto
 jab unase 4 saal puure hone par poocha gaya ki 10 main se kitne number denge to unhone kaha ye uttar pustika kori he

 The Sangh is not a registered institution

 sunil joshi jo kii sangh kaa prachaarak he jo kii bomb blast main aaropee tha uski hatya kisne kii
 The people of the union killed
 unako sajaa bhi hui he

 This ideology leads to violence
 'media mere sirf ek paksh ko dikhaanaa chahta hedigvijay singh ne kaha, main pehla vyakti tha jisane osama bin laden ke khilaaf bolaa tha
 The difficulty is that the media wants to show only one side of me

 i also oppose why these people chant the slogan Jai Shri Ram, why they forget Sita ji
 siya ram kaa naaraa lagaaein
 These people are not religious
 ye dharmandhata failaate hai
 And righteousness spreads hatred

 ' yah self help main sabase zyaada maane-jane vaale vichaaron main se ek he
 It is not necessary that there should be only 5 people
 dhyaan dene vaali baat yah he ki aapke jivan par sabase adhik prabhaav lagaataar aapke aasapaas rahane vaale logon kaa hi padataa he
 Now of course it is not easy to find 5 right people, but you can search for peers and colleagues whose life is as you want to spend it
 aapke kareebi doston ke group main in 5 prakaar ke logon ko nishchit rup se hona chahie
 Those who do financial planning: Those who understand the need for investment and savings are smart, they think ahead and plan for the future

 Who is a fitness watcher: Your body is really a temple, it is important to have a friend who takes care of himself with his diet and exercise and influences you to do the same

 Abid Ali teaches at the MES School in Yakubpur Sanskrit Abid told bhu's Feroze Khan that there is a dispute over the selection of Muslim professor Feroz Khan to teach Sanskrit in the best Gurbhu
 vahiin vadodara main ek muslim guru pichley 22 saal se muslim chaatro ko sanskrit padhaa rahe hai
 The name of these Muslim gurus is Syed Abid Ali
 jaankaree ke mutabik muslim guru saiyad aabid ali pichley 22 saalon se vadodara ke muslim bahul yakubpur ilaake ke emies skool main sanskrit padhaate hai
 Sanskrit is their everyday language
 ve sanskrit kaa shloke or sanskrit ke veda upanishad ke bare main bacchon ko shiksha dete hai
 Not only this, when the children have difficulty in pronouncing Sanskrit words, then immediately the Yemuslim Gurus correct the pronunciation of their students
 biechayu main muslim professor niyukti par bole gurubiechayu main ek muslim professor firoz khan kii niyukti ko lekar ho rahe virodh pradarshan par muslim guru saiyad aabid ali kaa kahana he, 'sanskrit ek bhashaa he or firoz khan ek behtareen guru he
 If students do not study just because they are Muslim, then it is their misfortune
 'koun hai muslim guru saiyad aabid alimoslim guru saiyad aabid ali ne sardaar patel uniwarsity vidyanagar se sanskrit bhashaa or angreji main eme kiya he
 The special thing is that students study Sanskrit language very happily with Syed Abid Ali
 yahi nahin is skool se paas hokar nikalne ke baad kai chaatro ne sanskrit main emphil tak padhai kii he
 At the same time, students say that it is a language and everyone has the right to read the language
 jab kii ek muslim chaatra kaa kahana he ki wo arabi behad kam jaanati he lekin sanskrit uskaa pasandida vishay he isliye is vishay ko padhai ke liye chunaa he
 It is clear that there is a ruckus in BHU about Muslim Guru Feroze Khan, he is now being given a political form
 aise main saiyad aabid ali jaise muslim guru sanskrit jaisi pracheen bhashaa ko badhaava de rahe hai or ek misaal ban rahe hai

 maharashtra main sattarudh congress aurencipike bich takaraar istife kii siyasat tak pahunch chukaa he
 After the resignation of Deputy CM Ajit Pawar, all the NCP ministers have sent their resignations to the Maharashtra NCP President
 is bich buudhvaar do baje ensipi vidhayak dal kii baithak honi jisamen aage kii ranneeti tay kii jaaegi
 The result of the power game between uncle's nephew is shocking the NCP Congress on a jolt and the political ground of Maharashtra is shaken by staying on
 raajnneeti ke richter scale par pehla jhatka tab record hua jab dipti siem or sharad pavaar ke bhattije ajit pavaar ne chavaan cabinet se istipha diya
 The argument is that they are hurt by the allegations and will not hold office until Pakistan is proved clear
 ajit pavaar ke istife ke baad yah sawaal khadaa hua he ki kahin ye chachaa bhatija ke bich power game kaa nateeja to nahin
 But the NCP rejected all the questions, claiming from above that it would not have any effect on the health of the Maharashtra government
 ajit pavaar ke istife se congress ke hosh ud gaye
 CM Prithviraj Chavan phoned Sharad Pawar in a hurry and asked what to do with the resignation
 sutron ke mutabik pavaar ne chavaan ko kaha ki ajit pavaar kaa istipha manjuur kiya jaae
 But CM of Maharashtra is still in the mood for more thinking
 udhar, sharad pavaar ke is daawey ke baavjood kii maharashtra sarkaar sthir he, ajit pavaar ke istife ke kuch hi der baad ensipi cote ke 19 duusare mantriyon ne maharashtra ensipi adhyaksh ko apana istipha saunp diya
 There will be a meeting of NCP, meanwhile there will be a meeting of NCP Legislature Party at 2 pm on Wednesday, in which further strategy will be decided
 lekin sutara bataate hai ki ensipi ye tay kar chuki he ki ajit pavaar kaa istipha waapas nahin hoga
 It was good that Pawar resigned
 Opposition parties in Maharashtra welcomed Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar's resignation saying that the truth must be revealed
 bijepi kii pradesh ikai ke adhyaksh sudhir mungantivaar ne kaha, ‘chaahe adaalat kii ore se kii gayi katu aalochana ho yaa mukhyamantri kii ore se yah kahana ki vah sinchai ke mudde par shwet patr laaenge, koi bhi uchit jaanch tab tak nahin ho sakati jab tak mantri apane pad par baitha ho
 He said, 'it is good that he resigned
 ’ manase pramukh raaj thakare ne kaha ki ajit pavaar kaa istipha mahaj ek ‘nautanki’ he
 However, Lok Sabha member Supriya Sule from Baramati said that she was proud of Ajit Pawar
 unhone kaha, ‘rakanpa rajya main raajnneetik asthirataa nahin paidaa karnaa chaahati
 Ajit Dada has decided to resign after much deliberation
 mujhe apane bhai par garv he
 Pawar's resignation led to a rift in the alliance between the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party following the resignation of Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and the resignation of 20 ministers of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in the state government
 taaja raajnneetik halaat se mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan par dabaav bad gaya he
 The 13-year-old alliance of Congress and NCP has come as a shock to the resignation of Ajit, the 53-year-old nephew of NCP chief Sharad Pawar
 apane upar lage sinchai ghotaale se jude aaropon ke baad ajit ne istipha diya he
 He is accused of irregularities in sanctioning projects worth crores of rupees between 1999 and 2009 as the state's irrigation minister
 ajit or rakanpa ke anya netaaon ko nishaanaa banane vaali media rapaton ke saamne aane ke peeche party congress kaa haath maan rahi he

 unhone kaha ki aise mantriyon ko sarkaar main rahane kaa koi haq nahin he
 Congress leader Digvijay Singh said that the minister's statement is a cognizable offense and mere apology in it will not do

 He has apologized for this by coming to both the houses

 Therefore, the proceedings of the House should be allowed to run
 ' Yechury said how the House would function until the Minister was removed from the Council of Ministers

 Talk about the candidates who won by 1 lakh votes, there are many of them who have either not been given tickets or have changed their seats

 Giriraj, who won from Nawada last time, has been sent to Begusarai this time

 The opposition is also demanding an inquiry into the entire expenditure
 kehete hai kabhi cycle ko mohataaj rahe mantriji ne teen saal main hi akut sampatti bana lee he

 Russia was also seen moving with Pakistan many times, the sino-pakistan army also held a joint exercise several times, but Modi and Putin's bonding once again exposed the old friendship

 PM Modi raised the issue of terrorism in front of all countries

 Afzal Ansari, who recently merged his Qaumi Ekta Dal into the ruling Samajwadi Party (SP), says the bjp's plan is to make a dent in the sp's stronghold, but SP chief Mulayam Singh, who is going to be in Ghazipur on November 23 After Yadav's rally, he will get an idea of the ground reality
 ansaari ne ‘bhashaa’ se baatcheet main kaha ki pichhali 14 navambar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne gajipur ke artiai maidan main har lihaaj se asafal raily ko sambodhit kiya tha
 This is a major setback for the BJP leaders, who are intent on capturing political power in Purvanchal, which they are rightly accepting, but accept
 ab 23 navambar ko isi maidan par sapa mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav aitihaasik raily ke jariye apane chunaav abhiyaan kaa aagaaj karenge
 After this rally, BJP will get a sense of its status in the region
 unhone daawa kiya ki purvanchal main jansamarthan ke hisaab se mulaayam or modi ke bich koi tulana nahin he
 Modi has nothing in Ghazipur
 modi kii raily main apeksha ke lihaaj se 40 pratishat bheed bhi nahin ai thi
 Mulayam's rally will be much larger than Modi's rally
 is raily ko lekar kisaanon, garib tabake ke logon or naujavaanon main kaaphi utsaah he
 Ansari said that the SP chief has been giving respect to Mulayam Purvanchal earlier also
 vah hameshaa kehete rahe hai ki itawa ke baad gajipur unka ghar he
 He has also proved this by choosing Ghazipur for the beginning of his election campaign

 Filmed on Sanjay Dutt, this song from the film 'khalnayak' does not glorify the villains, but imagine what would have happened if films had no villains? If someone becomes a star, super star or mega star in Bollywood, then that is why he or she gets a brilliant villain
 jaahir he khalnaayaki kaa apana herodam he
 Journalist Fazle Gufran's book 'main Hain Khalnayak' is a book written on these artists of Hindi cinema
 hindi cinema ke itihaas se shuru kar yah kitaab khalnaayakon ke parichay, unke paarishramik, kisse, sangharsh aadi ke bare main bataati he
 This book provides information about hundred villains with a history of 100 years of Hindi cinema
 aise-aise khalanaayak jinhen parade par dekhte to aap pahchaan sakate hai, par jinhen lekar jaankaree kahin milti nahin
 The special thing is that with the famous villains who compete against the hero, they also mention those minor villains, who often see us as the main villain's henchmen, pawns, hangers, gang members or recovery men
 Have been, but do not remember
 yah kitaab khalnaayakon ke bahaane cinema ke us daur kii baat bhi karti he, jab parade par nibhaae gaye charitra ko nakli na maanakar asli mana jaataa tha, isiilie hero to devatulya banakar puja tak paa jaataa tha
 But because of the character played on the part of the villain, there were only abuses
 yah vah daur tha jab log nakaaratmak kirdaar nibhaane vaale kalakaaron ko asal jindagi main bhi bura insaan hi samajhate the
 Actors Ranjith and Shakti Kapoor have endured this pain for a long time
 shakti kapur kii beti or behtareen adaakara shraddha kapur ko to ab bhi kai tivi shoj main 'aau' kahkar chidhaa bhi diya jaataa he
 This book seems to be a memorable journey of a complete conversation with many artists, in which one person speaks from inside them, which no one has bothered to listen to
 abhinayta raja muraad kii baaten hairaan kar dene vaali hai, to sonu sood kii baton main utsaah or ummiden jhalkati hai
 While veteran actor Prem Chopra talks to Babaki about himself and the villains of the current era, Mukesh Rishi speaks about Pran and Ajith, who are among the great actors of villain and character roles
 kitaab main nai peedi ke khalnaayakon kii nijee or vyavsaayik donon baton kii charchaa he
 Pran Sahab, Prem Chopra, Ajit, Jeevan, Prem Nath, Madan Puri, Amrish Puri, Amjad Khan, Danny, Anupam Kher, Gulshan Grover, Shakti Kapoor, Kabir Bedi, Goga Kapoor, Sonu Sood, Rahul Dev, Ashutosh Rana and Prakash Raj There are interesting information about Adi, on the other hand
 en
 Interesting details of Singh, Kanhaiyalal, BM Vyas, Kamal Kapoor, Sheikh Mukhtiar, Dev Kumar, Anwar Hussain, Ram Narayan Tiwari, Chandra Mohan etc
 are included
 is kitaab main bab christo se lekar mohan aagaashe, shairi mohan, sudhir, mike mohan, mahesh anand, joginder, tej sapru, janaki das, ramesh deo sahit dheron khalnaayakon kaa zikr he
 Apart from these, the book also mentions such big actors, who played the role of villain on the big screen
 aise logon main shahrukh khan, jon abraham, aamir khan, sonu sood, vivek oberoi, ajay devgan, akshay kumaar, navazuddin siddiki, ranvir singh sahit kai or kalakaar bhi shaamil hai
 But this book is a miser about villains
 fajaale gupran kii kitaab main bamushkil se 10 khalanayikaon kaa zikr he, jinamein nadira, shashikala, lalita panvar, helen or bindu jaisi khalanayikaon ke anjaane kisson ke saath 1940 ke daur kii khalanayika kuldeep cor kaa vah kissa bhi isamen shaamil he ki bantwaare ke samay vah kis tarah akele car chalaakar dilli hote hue lahore se bombai aa gai thim
 Despite this, the book does not appear to do justice to villains
 jabaki koi daur aisa bhi tha ki bollywood kii koi film inaki adaakaari ke bina puri nahin ho sakati thi
 The importance of negative roles of female villains in the cinema can also be understood that such eminent heroines from old to modern era have been playing such roles
 hemamalini, jinat amaan, parveen babi, maahi gil, kalki kochalin, priyanka chopra, vidya baalan, kaajol, richa chaddha tak inamen shaamil hai
 Like every book, this book also has some goodness and some shortcomings
 shuruyaat acchhee he
 Everything goes well until Pran, Amrish Puri, Amjad Khan talks about the villains of the old era, but after that things go very fast
 fajaale bahut kuch dene ke chakkar main kaaphi kuch chhodane lagate hai
 The anecdote and interesting information gradually shrinks into figures full of dates and events with decreasing words
 lagata he samakaleen daur ke sabhi khalnaayakon or unase judi baton, jaankariyon ko sametane ke chakkar main fajaale gupran ise vikipedia sa bana dete hai
 If he had started it the way he wanted, he could have divided it into two sections
 par unhone aisa nahin kiya
 The author and publisher describes the book as a textbook for cine lovers as well as cinema students
 is prayaas main ve safal bhi hue hai
 This book has its own importance as a document for facts and information

 The Lok Sabha approved an important bill that provides for prosecution of juveniles between 16 to 18 years under adult laws for heinous crimes
 sarkaar ne is baat par jor diya he ki usne yah tay karne ke liye kaaphi santulan kaayam kiya he ki nirdosh bacchon ke saath anyaay nahin ho
 The 'juvenile Justice: Care and Protection of Children: Bill 2014' was approved after the government agreed to remove clause 7
 upbandh 7 ke mutabik, ‘koi bhi vyakti jisane 16 se 18 saal kii umr main kisi jaghanya aparaadh yaa gambhir aparaadh ko anjaam diya he, or vah 21 saal kii umr puri karne ke baad pakadaa jaataa he, to is adhinium ke praavdhaanon ke tahat us par vayask ke rup main mukadmaa chalaaya jayega
 'at least 42 amendments to the Bill were introduced by the government and all of them were accepted, while all amendments introduced by opposition members, including Shashi Tharoor of Congress and NK Premachandran of RSP, were rejected

 However, Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi said that she has made efforts to adopt a 'child friendly' approach and to create a 'perfect balance' between justice for victims and children's rights
 unhone kaha ki naye kanoon kii manshaa ek ‘‘pratirohak’’ ke rup main yah sunishchit karne kii he ki kishor aparaadhon se bachein or apni jindagi kharaab na na karen
 Justifying the need for a new law, Maneka Gandhi said that according to the National Crime Records Bureau, in 2013, around 28 thousand juveniles committed various crimes and out of these 3887 allegedly committed heinous crimes
 unhone supreme court ke ek haalia aadesh kaa zikr kiya, jahaan sheersh adaalat ne jaghanya aparaadhon main shaamil kishoron kii badhati sankhya ke maddenjar kanoon kii samiksha kii pairvi kii thi
 Maneka Gandhi rejected the views of opposition members that the 16-year-old is too young to prosecute under adult laws and is against international manifestos
 unhone kaha ki antarrashtriya ghoshnapatron ke anusaar aise aparaadhon ke liye umr kii paribhaasha desh vishesh kii aarthik, saamaajik tathaa anya maujuuda paristhitiyon par nirbhar karti he
 He cites the example that in England and Australia this age is ten years, while in Argentina it is 16 years and in France 17 years
 menka gandhi ne kaha ki prastaavit kanoon kaa ek anya positive pahalu dattak dekhbhaal he, jahaan parivaar kisi bachche kii dekhbhaal or use shikshit karne ke liye bina use god liye uski jimmedaari sweekaar kar sakate hai

 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Sushil Modi on Monday said that the NDA will go to the polls under the leadership of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in the next assembly elections as well, putting a stop to many political speculations
 susheel modi ke is bayaan ke turant do arth tatkaal nikaale ja rahe hai
 Currently, a Bharatiya Janata Party does not want to go to the polls by dumping Nitish Kumar in the Legislative Assembly elections, making it backward in the lone election, especially the Union Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai
 doosraa tejasvi yadav ke saath party ke kendriya netritv main koi balldor charchaa nahin ho rahi
 Because of which, when the RJD supremo Lalu Yadav's bail plea comes in the fodder scam, the CBI will take a soft approach towards him and whenever the BJP tries to weave Nitish Kumar a political taunt of dump before the assembly elections
 The role will remain neutral rather than in support of Nitish
 susheel modi ne jab apane bayaan main yah kaha ki koi duubati naiya kii sawari kyon karnaa chahega to nishchit rup se unka ishaara mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii taraf tha
 There is also a truth in this that if he is now Nitish Kumar or a novice of politics in the upcoming assembly elections, if he has two options to compete in the election field, one side with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and today's BJP -two hands and on the other hand, in politics, there are stunning Yadavs who get everything by the grace of father without struggle, who do not have the ability to save even a defeat
 If you are there, definitely no one will choose the stunning Yadav
 kyonki aaj NDA ke paas jo vot bank he or rajd kii jo khastahalat he uske baad nitish kumaar ke liye bihar main ek baar phir mukhyamantri chunaa janaa aupchaarikta hi rah gaya he
 However, the BJP has also hinted at a political alliance by accepting Nitish Kumar as his own or nda's face as he knows that if he will tease Nitish Kumar more in Bihar's triangular politics, he will once again be in opposition
 No one can save from the possibility of sitting
 duusari taraf nitish kumaar vipaksh main rahakar bihar se zyaada rajya ke baahar BJP ke liye ek pareshaani kaa strot ban sakate hai to baithe baithaae koi aisa jokhim kyon mol lenaa chahega
 Although there is no such thing in politics that the bjp's eye has shifted from the chair of Bihar Chief Minister's post, but that chair will easily get him sitting after Nitish Kumar after one or two years of his reign
 Assessment
 lekin susheel modi ke kathan kaa sabase zyaada asar RJD ke upar dekhne ko milegaa kyonki ek baar phir apane naakun nochane ke alaava koi doosraa vikalp nahin bachaa kyonki vah hameshaa loksabhaa chunaav ho yaa vidhansabha is firaaq main the ki BJP ke saath tanaav bade jiske kaaran niteesha unke paas aane ko majaboor hon
 But this wish of theirs will remain in the grip of the house and now Lalu Yadav also knows that keeping his mlas united is not in his absence, especially on the strength of his sons, especially because of the son of Tejashwi Yadav
 No wonder if he ends his political legacy

 Former PM Manmohan Singh held a press conference for the Congress in Gujarat on Tuesday
 gujarat chunaav se pehle unhone notebandi or jiesti ke liye vartmaan piem narendra modi ko jamkar kosa
 Reminding Mahatma Gandhi, he said- i want to ask the PM whether he thought for the benefit of the poor before taking such a big decision

 Manmohan Singh said- a Gujarati Mahatma Gandhi had said- Whenever you are in the world, think the face of the poor
 apane aap se (piem) puche- kya ye use phayda karegaa?2
 Will this decision end hunger? 3
 notebandi par sin karne se pehle unhone sochaa ki chote sectors kaa kya hoga?4
 What did the PM think about those who will get employment? 5

 4
 Did the PM think of the poor? The former PM said- i would say to the PM that he thought so before signing the dotted line with RBI or demonetisation? Did they think about the people in the informal sector? Thought of those who lost jobs? If the PM had kept Mahatma Gandhi's words in mind, the poor would not have had to face it

 Input: PTI banaras main sitambar, 2017 main jab pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bada lalpur main 200 karod rupye kii laagat se taiyaar hue trade facilitation centre kaa udghaatan kiya tha to laga bunakaron ke ‘achche din’ aa gaye
 At that time the Prime Minister had said, "this center will open the way to the global market for small weaver brothers
 iske jariye kaashi ke hunar kaa parichay puri duniya ko milegaa
 "the question is, after about a year and a half, have the weavers lucked out?" Weaver Faizal Shahid, a resident of Madanpur in Banaras, says, "good days have come, but not from weavers, but some influential traders
 bunakar ko vahi daam miltaa he jo paanch saal pehle miltaa tha
 "meher and my husband visited the trade center last year," says Mehrunnisa from Kabir Chowk
 hamen laga koi rasta batayega ki kaise ham bina bichauliyon ke apni saadiyon ke achche daam paa sakate hai
 But there is no advice center there
 ''faijal ke mutabik, "bina kisi netaa kii sifarish ke mudra lone nahin miltaa
 No small weavers within Banaras got any loans, which they got belonged to the merchant class
 "bunakaron ke is aarope par trade facilitation centre main kaaleen prashikshak adhikari pradeep yadav kehete hai, ''hamaare yahaan 82 dukaane hai
 Of these, there are 36 temporary shops (for six months) and 15 government departments such as Gujarat Handicraft and Handloom Department, Khadi Gramodyog Shops
 11 dukaane sthaayee (paanch saal ke liye lij par ) hai
 17 shops are yet to be allocated
 " lekin ek aam bunakar ko iskaa phayda kaise mil saktaa he? ve kehete hai, "haal hi main apravasi samaaroh (21-23 janvari) ke dauraan pradarshnee lagi
 People from all over the world came here
 banaras kii kaarigari or shilp ko duniya bhar ke logon ne dekha to isse bunakaron ke hunar ko log janenge
 "on participating in the exhibition, he says, the weavers choose the exhibiting institutions
 pradeep yadav yah bhi kehete hai ki abhi log yahaan dukaane lene main jhijakte hai
 Due to this 17 shops are lying vacant and 36 shops are temporary
 lekin sthaneey patrakaron kaa kahana he ki kisi event yaa phir narendra modi ke aane par hi yah trade centre sakriy hota he baaki yun hi padaa rahata he
 a source at the Trade Facilitation Center said, "it takes time for any work to come to fruition, in fact fewer weavers come to the center
 main aria se dur hona shaayad isaki vajah he
 "some weavers came here and then they left because of reduced profits
 ve kehete hai, yahaan par zyada se zyada paryatakon ko khinchne ke liye hamane kai prayaas kiye
 There were also meetings with several big hotel owners
 lekin main ilaake se dur hone kii vajah se paryatak yahaan aane se jhijakte hai
 Overall, the Trade Center, created to change the fortunes of weavers in the Parliamentary seat of the Prime Minister, is presently unable to bring good days to the common weavers

 They ask, how can the illiterate weaver of a small village in Benaras without advice center bring his skills to the world? Banarasi sarees were exhibited at the Trade Center on 21-23 January
 lekin kabhi is adhikari to kabhi us adhikari ke daravaaje khatkhatane ke baad main samaj gaya ki bina pahunch ke yah kaam ho hi nahin saktaa
 What was the motive? -trade Center was to promote, marketing, branding and exporting Varanasi handlooms, handicrafts, carpets, brocades and khadi products
 -is centre ke jariye karigar or bunakaron ko production ke liye kaccha maal, takneekee, prabandhan aadi suvidhaayen di jaani thim
 Weavers and artisans at this center were also supposed to connect the global market for quality products
 -centre par kshetreey udyogon ko behatar karne or antarrashtriya str par spardhaa laayak banane ke liye shodh centre bhi bananaa tha
 The market center of Mubarakpur also could not change the fate of the weavers like the situation in Mubarakpur of Azamgarh
 resham nagari ke naam se mashhoor mubarakapur main 2012 main tab ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne 45 acre jameen main bunakaron ke liye trade centre banane kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Here the weavers were to be allotted shops at a cheaper price
 lekin yah trade centre sarkari pench main funs gaya
 In 2017, the Yogi government once again spoke about changing the fortunes of the weavers through this trade center
 lekin kareeb 14 karod kii rakam se bane is trade centre main bunakaron ke liye aaj tak koi dukaan aavantit nahin kii gai
 *** centre sarkaar ke agadi jati ke aarthik taur par pichde logon ko 10 pratishat aarakshan die jane ke nirnay ke khilaaf dravid munetra kashgam (diemke) ne madras hai court main rit yachika daakhil kiya he
 In this petition, DMK has stated against the SC-ST to give 10 percent reservation to economically backward people in the general category by the center
 yah yachika diemke party sanghathan ke sachiv ares bharti ne file kiya he
 It has been said through the petition that this law made by the Center is against the decision given by the Constitution
 22 pannon ke is yachika main diemke ne 19 points main apni baat ko spasht kiya he
 Even before voting on the reservation bill in Parliament, DMK chief MK Stalin rejected the reservation bill outright
 yahi nahin, sansad main bhi diemke saansad em ke kanimojhi ne mukhar rup se is bill kaa virodh kiya tha or voting ke dauraan sadan se walk out kar gayi thim
 However, not only the DMK, but on 10 January, Delhi's non-governmental organization (NGO) challenged the constitutional validity of 10% reservation in jobs and education on the basis of economic backwardness of the general class
 enjio ne supreme court main yachika daakhil kii, jisamen is aarakshan bill ke liye samvidhan sansodhan adhinium par roak lagane kii maang kii gai he
 The 'youth for Equality' NGO has said that the amendment made by the Center violates the basic structure of the Constitution
 1992 ke indira saahani cese kaa hawala dete hue youth for equility ne supreme court ke faisle ko aadhaar banaaya
 The court had said in this matter that economic norms cannot be the sole basis for granting reservation under the Constitution
 dilli ke is enjio ne yachika main likhaa, 'samvidhan sanshodhan (103waan) purna rup se sanvaidhanik maanak kaa ulanghan karata he
 It was stated by 9 judges in the Indira Sawhney case that economic norms cannot be the sole basis of reservation
 aisa sanshodhan doshapurn he or ise avaidh tehraaya janaa chahie kyonki isamen faisle kaa khandan kiya gaya he
 The petitioner said, "the amendment has violated the upper limit of 50 per cent fixed for reservation in Indira Sawhney case by the Supreme Court
 'loksabhaa chunaav ke thik pehle centre dwaara saamaanya varg ke garibon ke liye uthaae gaye is kadam loklubhaavan mana ja rahaa he
 While voting on this reservation bill in Parliament, almost all the opposition parties had voted in its favor, but the timing of this bill was questioned by everyone in unison
 congress samet tamaam vipakshi netaaon ne kaha, 'desh main naukariyon kii pehle hi kami he, aise main 10 fisadi aarakshan dene kaa yah kadam ek baar phir centre kii modi sarkaar dwaara diya gaya jumala hi sabit hoga
 ' bihar main jail adhikariyon or karmchaariyon ke prashikshan ke liye sudharatmak prashasnic santhaan kholaa gaya he

 isse pehle bihar ke jelon main tainaat adhikariyon ko prashikshan ke liye anya rajyon main bheja jaataa tha
 On this occasion, several schemes were also launched to improve the prison system
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne bihar ke sabhi jelon ke computerikrut kiye jane, sabhi jelon main kaidiyon ke liye telephone booth or canteen kii bhi shuruyaat kii he
 The Chief Minister claimed that within the next one year, all the jails of Bihar will be equipped with video conferencing facilities
