 The jail department of Chhattisgarh has issued a peculiar decree on the occasion of Rakhi
 ye farmaan raakhi kii rasm adaayagi ke dauraan bhai kaa munh meetha karaane se judaa he
 According to the jail administration, the sisters will be able to bring only one hundred grams of sweets and that too only Besan Ladoo of Bundi or Besan
 jabaki khoa se bani mithaiyon par bain lagaaya gaya he
 The reasoning behind this is that mold made from khoya is moldy, whereas Besan or gram flour gram flour can be kept for several days
 yah farmaan rajya kii sabhi aadha darjan central jail main lagu hoga, in jelon main lagbhag 25 hajaar kaidi hai
 Due to this decree, the undertrials and common inmates in various jails of Chhattisgarh will not be able to get the sweets they want on Rakshabandhan
 unhen sirf bundi yaa besan ke laddu kaa swaad chakh kar hi raakhi kaa tyohaar manaanaa hoga
 Prisoners will neither taste the taste of their favorite sweets nor will they be able to bring them to jail
 jail main bandiyon ko raakhi baandhne or unka munh meetha karaane ke maamle main jail prashasan ke farmaan par grih vibhaag kii muhar bhi lag gai he
 According to this, only a hundred grams of sweets and rakhi for the prisoners will be able to take them inside the jail
 jail prashasan kii maane to kaidiyon ke parijan apane saath sirf bundi yaa besan ke laddu lekar aa sakenge
 Usually most of the sweets are made from khoya and other milk products, but these sweets will not be able to feed their brothers
 bhale hi unhen ye mithaiyaan bhaati ho
 Social activist Mamta Sharma expressed strong objection to this decree and said that such things should not be banned on the occasions of festivals
 jail prashasan ko maanviya drushtikon apana kar faisla waapas lenaa chahie
 On the other hand, this peculiar decree of jail administration is a surprise for women, because never before had they faced any ban on sweets on the occasion of the festival, but even if the victim is swept away? The jail administration has given its decree and Raksha Bandhan is due a day later
 lihaaja kai bahanon ne apni shikaayat saamaajik sanghathanon se kii he
 This is the first time that the jail administration of Chhattisgarh has issued such a circular regarding a festival
 kai mahila sanghathanon ne is farmaan ko radd karne kii maang kii he
 Earlier, the prisoners used to feed their sisters sweets on their rakhi

 According to Rami Abdel Rahman, leader of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an organization fighting for human rights in Syria, the 400 people who have been kidnapped by ISIS late-azer have come from the Sunni fraternity

 , Where there is a glut of oil wells and in such a situation, ISIS is expected to benefit not only locally but also in terms of income

 Earlier, after the match played against Pakistan in Kolkata in February 1999, Tendulkar averaged less than 54 runs per innings
 yah vahi match tha jisamen pehali pari main unhen shoeb akhtar ne shunya par out kiya tha, jabaki duusari pari main vah vivaadaaspad tareeke se nau ran banaakar ran out ho gayi the
 This gives Tendulkar an average of 53
 19 par pahunch gaya tha
 Tendulkar, however, played two brilliant innings of 53 and 124 not out in the next match against Sri Lanka in Colombo, which increased his average to 54
 49 par pahunch gaya tha
 After this, Master Blaster never looked back and never let his average fall below 54 for the next 14 years
 is bich farvari 2002 main zimbabwe ke khilaaf nagpur main 176 ran banane se unka ausat 58
 87, which is the best average of Tendulkar's career
 june 2001 se disambar 2002 tak tendulkar kaa ausat 57 or 58 ran prati pari ke kareeb rahaa, lekin dakshin africa ke khilaaf janvari 2011 main aakhri baar shatak jadne ke baad unke ausat main lagaataar giravat aane lagi
 Tendulkar has played 38 innings after this, in which he could not get hundreds
 in pariyon main unhone 32 
 Has scored 1159 runs at an average of 19 which includes eight half-centuries
 tendulkar ne chaar janvari 2011 ko capatoun main 146 ran kii pari kheli thi
 He averaged 56 after this match

 He averaged 55 at the end of the series
 44 par pahunch gaya
 He then managed to score only 63 runs in three innings of two matches against New Zealand

 He averaged 54 as he scored only 13 runs in the first Test match played against England in Ahmedabad
 93 tak ludhak gaya tha
 Tendulkar 18 in the home series against England

 It was natural that his average was badly affected by it

 input language input : bhashaa Former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Ajit Jogine said that he will fight vigorously against the Congress in the upcoming assembly elections but will not speak against the Gandhi family
 desh ke sabase puraane siyaasi dal main rahane ke dauraan jogi ke gandhi pariwa ke saath behad achche rishte the
 Jogi said that the real contest in the next month's assembly elections is between his-led Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J) and the ruling BJP
 jogi kii party ne vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye mayawati kii bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ke saath gathbandhan kiya he
 He said, 'I have left the Congress party and will campaign against the party in the assembly elections but will not speak against the Gandhi family who have always given me love
 ’ madhyapradesh se alag hokar chhattisgarh banane ke baad jogi pradesh ke pehle mukhyamantri the
 He was with the Congress then

 Regarding the allegations against United Progressive Alliance (UPA) president Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra, he said, "I will not say anything about a family member of the Gandhi family even during the elections
" mere dashakon par parivaar ke saath behad achche sambandh rahe hai
 It is also a strange coincidence of politics that four members of the Jogi family are with three different political parties
 jogi or unke putr jahaan jessisi(je) main hai, jogi kii patni congress or unki bahu basapa ke saath hai
 Taking a dig at the Congress, Jogi said that it is a past power which is nowhere in the contest in Chhattisgarh
 unhone kaha, ‘congress ke paas pradesh main na to koi cheharaa he na hi koi sanghathan
 She has no leader and has become unsuitable

 - aisi manyata he ki mathura chhodane ke baad bhagwaan shrikrishna ne dwarka main ek nayaa nagar basaaya
 Its ancient name was Kushasthali

 unhone shrikrishna ko shraap diya ki jis tarah kauravon ke vansh kaa naash hua he thik usee prakaar puure yaduvansh kaa bhi naash hoga

 What will be born from its womb? The sage became enraged by the insult and cursed that - This son of Shri Krishna will make an iron pestle to destroy the Yaduvanshi clan, so that he will destroy his clan himself

 bangladesh match ke baad bhale hi kuch pahaluon par team india kii aalochana ho rahi ho, lekin yah match team india ke liye kuch posytius lekar aayaa he
 Dhoni himself is also considering this performance of his youth under pressure as a big plus
 team india ke liye kya rahe hai ve plus points, aaiye jaanate hai
 
 
 Captain Cool's superb captaincy and wicketkeeping were the key reasons why Team India won
 dhoni ne 2 stamping kii or ant main apana dhairya barkaraar rakhte hue ek ahm ran out kiya
 Asked questions on his captaincy and calm mind, Dhoni himself said that i think it is most beneficial that you listen and do what you think is right
 agar mujhe lagata he ki kuch karnaa chahie to main uske saath janaa pasand karata hum
 Yes, it is helpful to live with an open mind in such situations
 kai baar aap dabaav main ek daayre ke andar hi sochate hai or yahaan par dusron kaa suzav madadgaar hota he, lekin aapako sab sujhaavon kaa akalan karnaa hota he or uske liye samay bahut kam hota he
 The second plus point from the match was Jasprit Bumrah, who made a spectacular comeback despite his own bad days under so much pressure and gave the team hope of victory
 17wein or 19wein over main unhone kul 13 ran die, jisase team india match main vaapasi kar saki
 He bowled all the yorkers
 bumraah par mahendra singh dhoni ne kaha ki agar aap unka antarrashtriya kariyar dekhen to yah pehla aisa match he, jisamen un par dabaav tha
 It is not just the bowling pressure, i consider him a little weak in the field of fielding
 bangladesh ke khilaaf match kaaphi ahm tha
 We all knew this and in the beginning if you get misfired on the very first ball, then there is a lot of pressure, which also shows in their bowling
 phir unhone kaich bhi chhod diya
 At such a time, it was necessary to tell them that thinking about what happened, the batsman will not be out now and after that he made a strong comeback
 teesraa positive he hardik pandya
 He tried to play the role he was given
 
 Shown a big heart, ready to take responsibility
 tippaniyan Dhoni said on Pandya that i think it was a very good match for him
 uski vajah yah ki unhen dabaav main gendbaaji kerani thi
 The good thing is that he wanted to do this and was ready with his plan
 mujhe lagata he ye unke liye or team ke liye acha he
 Now it is expected that after such performance in this pressure-filled match, the team will perform well with these positives
 captain kool kii shandaar captaini or wicketcaping ve ahm vajah jiske chalate team india jiti
 Dhoni did 2 stumpings and scored a crucial run out, keeping his patience at the end
 khud dhoni ne apni captaini or shant dimag par sawaal puche jane par kaha ki mujhe lagata he sabase phydemand yah sabit hota he ki aap sabaki suno or vah karo, jo aapako sahi lagata he
 If i feel i should do something, i like to go with it
 haa, aise halaat main ek khule dimag ke saath rahanaa madadgaar hota he
 Many times, you think within a circle under pressure and here the suggestion of others is helpful, but you have to assess all the suggestions and the time for that is very less
 match se doosraa plus point rahaa jasprit bumraah, jinhone itane dabaav main unke khud ke liye kharaab din hone ke baavjood shandaar vaapasi kar team ko jeet kii ummid di
 He gave a total of 13 runs in the 17th and 19th overs, allowing Team India to return to the match
 unhone sabhi gend yorker phenki
 On Bumrah, Mahendra Singh Dhoni said that if you look at his international career, this is the first match in which he was under pressure
 yah sirf gendbaaji kaa dabaav nahin, main unhen fielding ke maamle main thodaa kamazor maanata hum
 The match against Bangladesh was very important
 ham sab ye jaanate the or shuruyaat main aapse pehali hi gend par misfield ho jaae to kaaphi dabaav hota he, jo unki gendbaaji main bhi dikhaa
 Then he also dropped the catch
 aise samay main unhen bataanaa jaruri tha ki jo hua so hua, us par sochane se ab ballebaaj out nahin ho jayega or uske baad unhone joardaar vaapasi kii
 The third positive is Hardik Pandya
 unhen jo role diya gaya use unhone bakhubi nibhaane kii koshish kii
 
 ek bada dil dikhaaya, jimmedaari lene ke liye taiyaar dikhe
 The comments dhoni ne pandya par kaha ki mujhe lagata he ki yah unke liye ek bahut acha match rahaa
 The reason for this was that he had to bowl under pressure
 acchhee baat yah he ki wo ye karnaa chaahate the or apane plan ke saath taiyaar the
 i think it's good for him and the team
 ab ummid yahi ki is dabaav bhare match main is tarah ke pradarshan ke baad team in posytius ke saath aage shandaar pradarshan karegi

 Surya Grahan 2019 (surya grahan 2019): nae saal kii shuruyaat hone ke baad yah pehla surya grahan (surya Grahan 2019) hoga

 haalanki ye ashink surya grahan (partial Solar Eclipse 2019) hoga
 There is also a lunar eclipse on 21 January
 aanshik surya grahan (partial Solar Eclipse) kaa samay subah paanch baje sa 9 bajkar 18 minute tak rahegaa
 This year there will also be two other solar eclipses (surya Grahan 2019)
 yah suryagrahan bharat (surya Grahan in India) ke sivaay china, mongolia, japan, rus or alaska ke kuch hisson main dikhegaa
 Currently, many films have been made in Hollywood and Bollywood about Solar Eclipse
 duniyabar main hue khagoli ghatnaon par vaastavik va kaalpanik kahani ke aadhaar ko lete hue surya grahan(solar Eclipse) or chandra grahan (lunar Eclipse) par kai filmein banaai gai he
 Information about the effects of the eclipse on the earth is shown in the films
 haalanki zyaadaatar filmein kaalpanik or kathith kahaniyon par aadhaarit hote hai
 Films on Solar Eclipse 2019: a drama film was made on the 1981 Hollywood film 'bloody Birthday' Eclipse
 is film dikhalaayaa gaya tha ki saal 1970 ke dauraan pade grahan (eclipse) ke dauraan paidaa hone teen bachche killer ban jate hai
 After 10 years of eclipse, when children also turn 10, then people who do not like them start killing them all
 logon ko maarthe vakt teenon bacchon ko koi bhi nahin roak paata
 In this 85-minute film, the effects of Eclipse on children are shown
 1995 main ai film "dolores cleborn" (dolores Claiborne) main surya grahan (solar Eclipse 2019) par filmein kii vajah se samay parivartan kaa drishy dikhalaayaa gaya he
 a man running to kill a woman suddenly gets trapped in a deep pit and as soon as the solar eclipse occurs, the person falls and dies
 ek or film ke bare main baat karen to saal 1985 main ai 'ladihock' film main surya grahan (solar Eclipse) ke dauraan ek dampati ko hameshaa ek saath rahane kaa shaap miltaa he or is shaap ke dauraan purush evaren of nevare bhediya ke rup main badal jaataa he, jabaki mahila isabe di'anjau ek hoque kaa bhesh dhaaran kar leti he
 During this, some such incidents happen, due to which the film becomes quite interesting
 in sabhi filmon ko surya grahan se joda gaya he
 Not only this, in 1975, the story of Bollywood's famous Amitabh Bachchan and Dharmendra's film Chupke Chupke on Doordarshan is quite interesting
 yah bhi surya grahan (solar Eclipse 2019) par aadhaarit film he
 Famous film director Hrishikesh Mukherjee's 'chupke Chupke' is a gripping comedy, in which Dharmendra concocts a story that makes one laugh at his brother-in-law, Om Prakash
 lekin 1980 ke dashak main is film kaa istemaal sarkaar ne janata ko surya grahan ke prakope se bachaane ke liye kiya tha
 It may sound strange, but it is a reality
 baat 16 farvari, 1980 kii he
 It was the day of solar eclipse
 sarkaar nahin chaahati thi ki janata bina kisi suraksha upaay ke surya grahan ko dekhe
 This was expected to damage their eyes
 sarkaar ne janata ko ghar main hi roke rakhane kaa upaay kiya
 The government made weapons into cinema and used a comedy film
 madhyam tha doordarshan
 In such a situation, it became the best weapon to stop people and the government used it well
 doordarshan par is din dharmendra or amitabh bachchan kii is hit kamedi ko surya grahan ke maukey par telecast kiya gaya
 This was the power of entertainment, due to which the government took care of the film to stop the public at home
 vaise bhi hrishikesh mukherjee kii filmein jindagi ke itane kareeb hoti thim ki har kisi ko aasaani se khud se jod leti thim

 15 agast 2014 ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne laal kile ke pracheer se kai badi ghoshnaaen kii thi
 In his first speech to the country from the ramparts of the Red Fort, Prime Minister Narendra Modi first introduced the outline of the government's strategy in Parliament
 narendra modi ne kaha tha, "ham bahumat ke bal par chalane vaale log nahin hai, ham bahumat ke bal par aage badhanaa nahin chaahate hai
 We want to move forward on the strong ground of consensus
 " But after a year, the opposition is questioning the Prime Minister's claim
 jedy-you ke pradhan mahasachiv kasee tyaagi ne kaha, "hamane unki baat par us samay bhi vishwaas nahin kiya tha, kya piem ne ek baar bhi koshish kii ki wo vipaksh se ek baar baat karen
 
 
 The Prime Minister says something and do something "
 jabaki sarkaar vipaksh ko sansad main gatirodh ke liye zimmedaar bataa rahi he
 Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi told NDTV, "we tried to go ahead with consent, but it is unfortunate that Congress leaders are trying to sabotage progress"
 apane pehle bhaashan main pradhanmantri ne kai ahm yojanaon kii ghoshnaa bhi kii thi, saansad adarsh gram yojana ke tahat har saansad ko 2016 tak apane kshetra main ek gaanv ko adarsh gaanv kii tarz par viksit karne kaa lakshya diya gaya
 Two-thirds of 2015 has passed but so far 100 mps have not even opted for Gram Panchayat in their area
 sabase peeche pashchim bengal he, jahaan 38 loksabhaa or 16 rajyasabha saansadon ne ab tak gram panchayat kaa chayan nahin kiya he
 CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury says, “panchayati Raaz is weak in Bengal
 paisa kisi gaanv main vikaas ke liye istemaal hoga yaa nahin koi guarantee nahin he
 All mps fear that the fund will be misused, looted ”
 doosraa ahm elaan svachh bharat abhiyaan ko lekar tha, pradhanmantri ne iske tahat sabase pehle desh ke har skool main is saal 15 agast tak tailet banane kaa torget fiks kiya
 The Prime Minister said that when we stand here next August 15, then stand with the belief that there is no such school in India, where separate toilets for children and girls are yet to be built "
 lekin pichley kuch maheenon main ji-tod koshishon ke baavjood 14 agast tak 6833 skulon main tailet nahin ban paye
 Union Minister Shripad Nayak says, "states have to do this work
 
 
 rajya kii mashinari agar thodaa tej chalegi to jaldi kaam hoga"
 When NDTV asked Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Babu Lal Gaur this question, he admitted that at first nobody took the issue seriously
 ab piem or mukhyamantri ke dhyaan dene kii vajah se kaam shuru hua he
 In the next one year, we will have toilet built in all schools ”
 pradhanmantri ne kai aisi ghoshnaaen bhi kin jin par sarkaar kaam karti dikhi

 An important announcement was made by the Prime Minister regarding the creation of a new institution in place of the Planning Commission, NITI Aayog was definitely formed, but in the first year, politics seems to be more on the platform of NITI Aayog
 piemo main rajyamantri jitendra singh ne enditivi se kaha, "niti ayog kaa acha anubhav rahaa he
 But the question should be asked to those (from the opposition) who boycotted the CM meeting "
 tippaniyan While Congress MP PL Punia says, "nothing is happening in the NITI Aayog today, calling cms and discussing the PM Land Bill
 unhen manaane kii koshish karte hai
 The government should have prepared its outline before setting up the NITI Aayog
 pradhanmantri ne ek saal pehle jo badi ghoshnaaen kii thim unamem se kuch main sarkaar ko kamyaabi milti dikhi, kuch par adchane jhelni padi or kuch lakshya se peeche nazar aa rahi hai
 It has to be seen what the Prime Minister in his speech of August 15 this year sets for the next one year
 lekin ek saal baad vipaksh pradhanmantri ke is daawey par sawaal khadey kar rahaa he
 JD-U Principal General Secretary KC Tyagi said, "we did not believe his point even at that time, did PM even try to talk to the opposition once
 
 
 pradhanmantri kehete kuch hai or karte kuch hai"
 While the government is blaming the opposition for the deadlock in Parliament
 sansadeey kaary rajyamantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne enditivi se kaha, "hamane koshish kii ki ham sahmati ke saath aage badhen, lekin ye durbhagyapurna he ki congress ke leader progress par palitha lagane kii koshish kar rahe hai"
 In his first speech, the Prime Minister had also announced several important schemes, under the MP Adarsh gram Yojana, every MP was given the goal of developing a village in his area on the lines of Adarsh village by 2016
 2015 kaa do-tihaai vakt nikal chukaa he lekin abhi tak 100 saansadon ne apane ilaake main gram panchayat kaa chayan bhi nahin kiya he
 West Bengal is behind, where 38 Lok Sabha and 16 Rajya Sabha mps have so far not opted for the Gram Panchayat
 sipiem mahasachiv seetaram yechuri kehete hai, "panchayat raaj bengal main kamazor he
 There is no guarantee whether the money will be used for development in a village
 sabhi saansadon ko dar lagata he ki fund kaa durupyog hoga, lut hogi"
 The second important announcement was about the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, under this, the Prime Minister first fixed the target of making toilet in every school of the country by 15 August this year
 pradhanmantri ne kaha thash jab ham agle 15 agast ko yahaan khadey hon, tab is vishwaas ke saath khadey hon ki ab hindustan kaa aisa koi skool nahin he, jahaan bachche evam bacchiyon ke liye alag toilet kaa nirmaan hona baaki he"

 apgrade ke baad miraj ne 45 minute kii pehali safal udaan bhari
 Of course Mirage has been made by French company Dassault but it has been upgraded by Indian company Hindustan Aeronautics Limited

 teen talaak ke khilaaf laae gaye bill main ye hai praavdhanmaukhik, likhit yaa kisi anya madhyam se koi pati agar ek baar main apni patni ko teen talaak detaa he to vah aparaadh kii shrenee main aayega
 After giving three divorces, the wife herself or her close relatives will be able to file a case in this regard

 What is divorce-e-bidat? Saying divorce thrice at a time is called divorce-e-bidad
 bidat yani vah kaary yaa prakriya jise islam kaa mul ang samajhakar sadiyon se apanaaya ja rahaa he
 When nothing is proved with the Quran and the Hadith, it is bound to be accepted or accepted as Islam
 isliye, tripal talaak ko talaak-e-bidat kehete hai
 Because there exist other Islamic methods of divorcing and giving, which were actually brought for the betterment of women
 mahilaon ke adhikaar ke liye paigambar sahab laae the talaak-e-ahsalarab main pehle muslim auraton kii dasha kharaab thi
 They were traded as slaves
 talaak bhi kai tarah ke hua karte the, jisamen mahilaon ke adhikaar na ke baraabar the
 Therefore, Prophet Hazrat Mohammed brought all the divorces to e-divorce
 ise talaak kaa sabase acha tarika mana gaya he
 It is not necessary to speak divorce thrice
 ek baar talaak kehane ke baad teen maheene kaa intazaar hota he
 If the husband and wife do not live together in three months, then divorce occurs
 isse mahila kii garima bani rahati he
 Other methods of divorce in Muslims
 In Muslims, only three divorces are considered a method of divorce
 haalanki teen talaak se hone vaale talaak kaa hissaa bahut kam he
 There are also popular methods like divorce, divorce-e-ahsan, talaq-e-hasan, divorce-e-mubaraat among Muslims
 inke madhyam se hi adhiktar talaak hote hai

 main is 'dukh kii ghadi' main aapke saath hum or aapaki is musiibat ko 'rashtriya aapadaa' ghoshit karne kii maang karata hum
 You are bound to be disturbed by the data which has come out on the basis of religion
 aakhirkaar beete ek saal se aap 10-10 bachche paidaa karne kii salaah dete rahe, lekin kisi ne aapaki suni nahin
 Perhaps it would have been considered an election jumla, like a good day and a 15 lakh pillow-seat, after all you call yourself an agent of the government, so the public is bound to misunderstand
 mjedaar baat ye he ki aap jinhen gaiyr samajhakar dutkaarte rahe unhone aapke 'tathakthith apano' se badhkar aapaki baat maani or aabaadi main 24 fisadi kaa ijapha karke aapke vachanon kii laaj rakh lee
 (because according to you, all Hindu children
) is paavan avasar par aapako to khush hona chahie, kyonki aap jise virdohi samaj rahe the vah to aapaki hi baat par amal kar rahaa he
 That is, spies are hidden in your house, who advise others to have 10 to 10 children by sterilization or not marrying themselves
 aise logon kii baat bhala koun sunegaa jo desh kii aabaadi badhaane main apana yogadan nahin de sake
 Whether it is a monk or a sadhvi
 or manch par chadh kar bachche paidaa karne kaa gyaan baantate hai
 Now you tell me, after all, who believes in people without experience in this country? If you really want to protect religion, then think of it as a 'gesture of time'
 kabhi-kabhi mujhe aapaki niyat main bhi khot najar aata he
 You go around in every corner of the country and appeal to the Hindus to produce 5 children, 10 children, while there, there is also talk of punishing Muslims for having more than two children
 un par aapraadhik mukadmaa chalaane kii baat karte hai, unka rashan card or naukari chhinane kaa bhi dam aap josh se bharte hai, lekin 8 bachche paidaa karne vaale hindu ke aap charan dhokar pi jaaenge? or jab kuch saalon baad vah bhukhmaree ke kagaar par baitha apni kismat ko kos rahaa hoga to shaayad hi aap uske aas-paas fatken
 By politics of dividing the country into different factions, you will only take it into the trough
 'vishwa kalyaan' or 'vasudaiv kutunbakam' tip aapke jo puraatan se chale aa rahe 'hashtag' hai wo trend hone ke bajaay kho rahe hai
 Therefore, improve both policy and intention, the country will be well with you

 purv bhartiya cricketer or hindi camentator ke rup main nai pari kii shuruyaat karne vaale navjot singh siddhu ne badlaav ke daur se guzar rahi bhartiya team ke liye sachin tendulkar kii bhoomika behad ahm qaraar dete hue kaha ki 'master blaster' ke paas balla he, 'sudarshan chakra' nahin jise har samay kamyaabi mili
 Tendulkar has been able to score only 153 runs in the last 10 innings, raising questions about whether he should remain in the team
 siddhu ne haalanki tendulkar kii aalochanaon ko sire se khaarij kar diya ki or kaha ki vartmaan daur main desh unke sanyas ke bare main soch bhi nahin saktaa

 He does not have a Sudarshan Chakra, bat and bat sometimes misses
 jab unki aalochana hoti he, to dukh hota he, kyonki sachin shakhsiyat nahin sanstha hai
 He is a Kohinoor and cannot be made of glass

 In Gitanjaya Sahuhal, Aarey Colony of Mumbai remained in the news due to various wrong reasons
 chaahe vah aare colony ko sangrakshit van ghoshit karne kii yachikaaon ko khaarij karne kaa mumbai hycourt kaa faisla ho yaa is aadesh ke kuch hi ghanton ke bheetar pedo ko kaat daalana, yaa phir ped kaatane kaa virodh karne waalon ke khilaaf aapraadhik mukademe darj karnaa ho
 The Supreme Court on October 7 barred the government from cutting more trees in the saws, but by then it was too late
 mumbai metro rail korporation ne court ko bataaya ki vah kaatane ke liye tay 2,185 pedo main se 2,141 ped kaat chuki he
 Meanwhile 29 arrested protesters were released on bail, but the damage was already done
 darasal, unke khilaaf bhartiya dand samhita kii chaar dhaaraon ke tahat aapraadhik aarope darj hue the
 Aarey Colony is spread over an area of 1,287 hectares
 isamen 4,50,000 ped hai, jinamein kai viluptpraaya prajatiyaan hai
 There are also 27 tribal villages
 sthaneey or rajya ke sattadhariyon ne beete paanch dashakon main aare kii saikadon hectare jameen vibhinn vyavsaayik or vikaas pariyojnaon ke liye chori-chhipe baant di he
 The Mumbai Metro Car Shed Project is the latest among them that has been given 33 hectares of land
 shahar main raay banty hui he ki yatayaat kii jarurat puri karnaa aarthik taur par kitna vyaavhaarik he or iske liye paryaavaran kii kitni keemat chukaani chahie
 The second point of concern is that undemocratic and ambiguous methods were adopted to expedite the metro projects
 logon ke aakrosh or vaikalpik jagah hone ke baavjood, sattadhariyon ne saare virodh ko dhata bataakar aare kii 165 hectare jameen kii adhisuchana radd kar di
 This freed the land from the 'no development zone' and is now available for 'commercial use'
 sarkaar ne jor-shor se daleel di ki aare jangal nahin he, par iske samarthan main usne jameen ke darje ko lekar koi dastavej yaa record saamne nahin rakhaa
 Expert members of the bmc's tree authority were not given enough time to fully examine the details of the tree trees
 yahi nahin, saal 2012, 2014 or 2017 main pariyojna sthal se ikattha kiye gaye aankadon main kai visangatiyaan thim
 The haste shown in cutting the trees within a few hours of the October 4 order of the Mumbai High Court did not go as fast in following the previous orders, but rather the lethargy of the authorities was evident about them
 masalan, hycourt ke us aadesh ko bhi lagu karne main susti dikhi jisamen usne aare colony main 1861 se rah rahe hajaaron varli adivaasiyon—jo vishesh taur par atisamvedansheel adivasee samooh (pivitiji) hai—ko buniyadi suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karwaane ke liye kaha tha
 Even the constitutional provisions protecting PVTG from discrimination and suppression were bypassed and made possible because of the lack of clarity on the status of the ground of the saw
 paryaavaran kaaryakartaaon kaa dhyaan bhi mukhya rup se aare ke hare-bhare ped-paudhon par he; aare colony ke hajaaron pivitiji adivaasiyon ke adhikaron ko lekar koi khaas chintaa saarvajanik charchaaon or adaalaton main dikhaai nahin detii
 Meanwhile, Mumbai Metro Corporation has dismissed environmental concerns
 uskaa daawa he ki is pariyojna kaa acha asar hoga or carbon dioxide ke utsarjan main har saal 2,61,000 ton kii kami aegi
 This appears to be a full step of possibilities in the Paris Climate Agreement towards the intended contribution made by India at the national level, but the statement of Mumbai Metro is a mere statement
 khaskar is baat ko dekhte hue ki is kism ke akalan kii na koi sweekrut paddati he or na hi koi pramanik data maujuud he
 The Maharashtra government too has been beating the drum on the potential benefits related to the environment of this metro project, but its own record in terms of implementing environmental laws in the state is very poor
 rashtriya harith panchat (engiti) kii pashchimi peeth main maharashtra ke paryaavaran maamalon kii baari taadaad iskaa saboot he
 The government should probably focus more on the preamble to the Paris Agreement
 yah prastaavna sabhi deshon se ''maanavadhikaron ke prati apane-apane dayitvon kaa sammaan karne, unhen badhaava dene or un par vichaar karne'' ke liye kahati he
 On the other hand, threats and violence against Aare protesters have increased

 beete mangalvaar ko police ne jab mahila ke ghar kaa darwaja todaa, tab kamare main mritka kii laash buree tarah sadi-gali haalat main mili

 ' The phrase "catch-22" was coined in a novel written under the same title, whose story is based on a military background

 The Armed Forces have been sitting on a long-awaited list of fighters, missiles and helicopters to buy, but in the end they end up spending more money on the salaries of their 1
4 million personnel
 bas kaam chal jayega !is saal bhi vitt mantri arun jetali ne sena ko 2,79,305 karod ru
 Has given a budget of which a large part will be spent in salary and pension
 bajet main 93,982 karod ru
 That is, 34 per cent of the amount is given towards capital expenditure and Rs
 1,85,323 crore
 yani 66 fisadi rakam rajasav mad main jaaegi
 Significantly, in the figures given in the budget, Rs 1,08,853 crore kept for defense pensions
 shaamil nahin hai
 This can be better understood in the way that the country's expenditure on pension last year totaled Pakistan $ 8 billion (rs 51,000 crore)
 ) ke raksha bajet se doguna he
 The increase in the defense budget will help the country's security forces recover from this ambition, but also to bring an ideal ratio of 60 to 40 between revenue and capital, Rs 29,000 crore in the capital budget

 There is no hope in view of the past trends of low growth and other necessary expenses of the government

 There has been an increase of 8 per cent and Rs 7,000 crore more has been received in the capital budget for the purchase of new hardware

 raksha balon ko aadhunik banane ke pichley atake hue kaam—jaruri helicopter, vimaan or pandubbiyon kii lambii fehrist—takreeban 400 arab dollar ke aasapaas anke gaye hai
 The Armed Forces say they need the hardware for the threat of two-fronts fighting with China and Pakistan, which are connected to the country's more than 4,000 km long turbulent outskirts
 jetali ne lagaataar duusare saal apane bhaashan main raksha bajet ke khaake kaa koi zikr nahin kiya or isaki koi vajah saamne nahin ai he
 Instead, he outlined some proposals — for example, a new project to build a tunnel connecting Bomdila town in West Kameng district and Tawang in Sela Pass in Arunachal Pradesh
 yah surang bomdila-tawang ke raste ko har mausam main kargar sadak main badal degi
 He announced two new defense industrial production corridors (one is chennai-bangalore, the other is yet to be announced) and a new defense production policy
 is niti kaa elaan gharelu raksha menuphaccharing main nai jaan foonkane ke iraade se 2011 main upie sarkaar ne kiya tha, par endie ne ise taak par rakh diya tha
 The government had to rethink this because it needs a framework to carry forward its Make in India program

 The Chief Minister of Bihar has decided not to play Holi last year due to the death of 23 children from a mid-day meal at a government school in Dharmasati Gandaman village in Mashrakh block of Chapra

 idhar, varshon tak holi ke maukey par centre bane patna ke 10 circular road sthit purv mukhyamantri rabari devi or lalu prasad ke awaas par bhi is varsh sannata pasra he
 Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) workers are disappointed due to not playing Holi at Lalu's residence, even those who played Holi in Patna did not get full opportunity to play Holi this year
 gauratlab he ki lalu mukhyamantri pad par rahe hon yaa kendriya mantri yaa unki party bihar main vipaksh kii bhoomika main rahi ho, unke awaas par holi main raunak bani rahati thi
 Along with the Kurtafad Holi, there was a frosty period between the song of Fagua, in which people used to get drenched in the colors of Holi
 idhar, bihar ke police mahanideshak abhyaanand ke awaas par jamkar holi kheli gai or fagua ke geet goonjte rahe
 During this, Abhyanand also sang the songs of Holi and greeted the policemen with colorful colors
 unhone kaha ki holi ke parv par pulicekarmiyon ko chuttee nahin mil paati he, is kaaran ek hi sthaan par pulicekarmi jutakar holi manaate hai

 However, given Mamta's good equations with Sonia, it is no surprise that Mamata would meet him in Delhi as well

 According to sources, veteran leaders like Sharad Pawar will try to give direction to the future strategy after considering every minor aspect of opposition solidarity on this occasion

 dilli main farvari kaa mausam bahut khushnuma hota he, naa zyada garmi-naa zyada thandi
 The shriveled sunshine of January also starts expanding its range
 congress party bhi dilli ke is mausam se kuch sanket le rahi ho
 Usually, on Saturday morning, there was a stir at Rahul Gandhi's Tughlaq Road residence
 dilli ke netagan rahul gandhi se mil rahe the
 Interestingly, Congress rebel leader Arvinder Singh Lovely was also involved in their meeting
 meeting ke baad arvinder singh lavali, haaron yusuf or ajay maakan ke saath ek hi gaadi main baith kar baahar nikle or kuch hi der main press vaarta main yah elaan kar diya ki unki 11 maheene baad party main ghar vaapasi ho gai he
 Why did you say goodbye to the Congress? a few years ago, Arvinder Lovely, who had enjoyed ten years of power in the Sheela government, made headlines by shaking hands with BJP President Amit Shah
 tab arvinder singh lavali ke liye congress party ek bhrasht party thi jo emsidi chunaav main tikaton kii kharid-farokht kar rahi thi
 According to him, the 'future' of the Congress was over
 yah wo vakt tha jabaimasidichunaav sar par the or congress party ko unki sabase zyaada zarurat thi
 Seeing the party that raised him, he became the big face of the party
 30 saal main wo youth congress netaa se lekar shila sarkaar main shiksha or transport mantri rahe
 By 2017, the Congress was in disarray in Delhi and 'netaji' was seen as a greenery of the BJP
 ajay maakan se rarbachi kuchi kasar congress dilli adhyaksh ajay maakan ke cold treetment ne puri kar di thi
 As such, Rahul's eyes were awestruck by the sharp stance of Maken, AK Walia, Ramakant Goswami, Aaron Yusuf, JP Aggarwal and former Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit
 par apane 'aatm sammaan' kii raksha ke liye ghar ke bhedi ne lanka dhahaane kii soch lee
 The BJP won the MCD election and put Lovely Sahab on the back burner
 jaahir he honeymoon period khatm hone ke baad arvinder singh lavali ko ab dobaaraa congress kii yaad sataane lagi to waapas chale aae
 After 9 months neither the Congress Party remembers Lovely's complaints and declarations nor the serious allegations made by Netaji against the Congress Party
 donon isi kahawat se santosh kar rahe hai ki subah kaa bhuulaa agar shaam ko ghar waapas laut aae to use bhuulaa nahin kehete
 On answering all the questions, Randeep Surjewala said that Arvinder Singh Lovely was hurt at that time and when someone is hurt, then what he says should not be taken to heart
 udhar rahul gandhi ke chahete maakan kii siyaasi ganit main arvinder singh lavali ghar vaapasi bilkul feet baithti he
 After taking command in 2014, many powerful leaders were falling apart due to Maken
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne bhi maakan ko apane kunbe ko ekajute rakhane kii hidaayat de di
 There is enough cue for the wise and high command for the leader
 so apni puraani virdohi dilli kii purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit ko pehle manaaya or phir lavali jaise baagi netaaon ko bhi ekajute karne kii kavayad main he
 This is a very interesting turn in the politics of Delhi Congress and for Maken, it is necessary to keep the fort of Delhi strong in order to retain the important role in Team Rahul

 The head of the Department of Assisted Reproduction at Jaslok Hospital, Mumbai, Dr

 Dr returned from the US in 1989 to open an IVF center in Jaslok
 paarikh tabhi se isi dincharya kaa paalan kar rahi hai
 But nowadays they are stunned by the trouble of the couple waiting for their turn
 desh main pehali baar 'ek-si berth' athwa intracito-plasmik sperm injection (isiesai) takanic ke jariye baccha paidaa karaane vaali doctor paarikh bataati hai, ''aajkal log itnaa ehtiyaat baratane lage hai ki ve sidhe infertility visheshgyon ke paas pahunch jate hai
 "this concern is reflected in the increasing number of such people in hospitals: Jaslok's OPD in 1990 brought about 450 patients, while today it has grown to about 1,500
" clinicon main earti upachaar karaane waalon kii sankhya bhi bad gai he-1991 main 1,000 se 2009 main 4,000
 Seeking medical help from troubled couples for the baby does not make headlines but trouble in pregnancy is news

 However, IVF clinics are in business
 2000 main unki sankhya 31 thi, jo ab badhkar 800 ho gai he
 Their development tells the story of growing infertility in the country

 Now take the example of Meenu Singh of Delhi
 jis mahila ne kabhi aspirin tak nahin khai uske liye otias main janaa-aana, saikadon goliyaan khaanaa or baar-baar injection lagavaana jindagi kaa hissaa ban gaya he
 He married one of his classmates nine years ago — both are executives at the pharmaceutical company and are 35 years old
 vakt bitne ke saath hi jab garbhadhaaran karne kaa intjaar badhata gaya to ve ek clinics main ja pahunchin
 During the last three years, she has suffered several vortices - her uterus has been cured, sperm samples collected, ovaries removed, embryos frozen in ice, repeated miscarriages, the body separated from the pregnancy cycle
 unka vajan gata-badha, raktastrav hue, glucose chadhaaya gaya, bhaavnaatmak utaar-chadhaav kaa daur jhelana padaa or baar-baar khud se yah sawaal poochna padaa, ''kya sachmuch hamen isse guzarane kii jarurat he?'' is baar unke tisare ivief chakra main unke saare andanu 'grad e' ke hai
 However, they have repeatedly faced hope and hopelessness and have spent Rs 5 lakh

 By the way, the term infertility remains unclear

 The institute has been running an infertility clinic for the last two decades but mainly focuses on family planning, mother-child health

 aaj santanheenata ke sawaal par visheshgyon main matbhed he-kuch kehete hai ki yah teji se bad rahi he, jabaki kuch is baat ko khaarij kar dete hai
 The definition of this word is also not agreed upon
 agar koi mahila ek saal tak garbh nirodhakon kaa istemaal kiye bagaiyr sakriy prayaas karne ke baavjood garbhadhaaran nahin kar paati to kya aap ise banjhapan kahenge?vishwa swasthya sanghathan (dablyuechao) ne isaki samay seemaa badhaakar do saal kar di he
 Infertility turns into 'childlessness' when a woman reaches the age group of 40-44 and is unable to give birth to a 'live child' despite intercourse without contraceptives
 or 'sakriy prayaas' kaa matlab kya hota he? is bare main kisi ko thik se maaloom nahin he
 Even the victims of childlessness are not known

 When Nina Malhotra sees patients at aiims's Infertility Clinic, she finds the word 'active effort' ridiculing everything she has read about human sexual relationships
 ve kahati hai, ''mujhe madhya -varg ke kaaphi aise yuva danpatiyon ke bare main maaloom he jo ascharyajanak rup se bahut kam sambhog karte hai
 "last week they had a couple of thirty years old who have been married for eight years and have been trying to have a child for the last three years
" unhone bataaya ki ve sari koshishen karte hai-yah bhi bataa diya ki jab unamem se ek ghar par hoti he to doosraa daftar main yaa desh bhar ke daure par niklaa hota he
 "they are not aware that irregular sex can lead to the loss of the cycle of ovulation, which is important for conception," she says

 Fogsy President Dr

 Gupte says, "by the time they get out of their office, they have reached the shopping mall and then watched all the TV programs on their own
" aise main sambhog ke liye samay hi nahin bachataa
 "in addition, inverse working times, inactive lifestyles, unhealthy food, and tremendous stress disturb the balance of hormones — particularly prolactin — in the body
" santan-hinata se jude har tisare maamle main prolactin kaa str bahut zyada hota he
 Junk food, smoking, alcohol, narcotics, electromagnetic radiation, stress, sleep deprivation and pollution increase the discomfort of these professionals

 Apparently, his sperm count was fluctuating according to his profits and losses

 "for a long time, infertility was blamed only on women
 aaj fallopian tub kii kharabi-jo 40 fisadi banjhapan kii vajah he-ke alaava kai nae maamle saamne aa rahe hai
 For example, Chlamydia is the most common sexual infection

 The report shows that this 0 in India
 2 se 40 fisadi maamalon main he or iske bare main logon ko jaankaree tak nahin he
 Similarly, 16 to 22 percent of fibroids cases have been reported to women during their reproductive period and 50 percent of women visiting infertility clinics have reported this
 iske alaava, jananaangon main tapedic rog (tibi) ke 18 fisadi maamle bhi hai
 Research in genetics is also proving to be very effective in treating infertility
 centre for cellular and molucular biology kii lakshmi raav kaa kahana he, ''chromosome main parivartan se anuvaanshik gadabadi paidaa ho sakati he or yah banjhapan kii samasyaon main dikhataa he

 a new term 'voluntary infertility' is being used in the field of infertility, which is typical of urban areas of the country
 isaki jad main yah vichaar he ki 'biological clock' koi mithyaa nahin he-aam mahila ke 90 fisadi andanu 37wein varsh main kharaab ho jate hai
 At the center of this new trend is the educated, independent, career-oriented new woman, who avoids marriage and childbearing until she achieves the best in life
 lekin jab tak vah baccha janane kaa faisla karti he tab tak uski jaivik ghadi dhimi pad jaati he
 He needs the help of ART specialists to have a child
 eniefechadblyoo ke devaki nandan kehete hai, ''ab log tisek yaa yahaan tak ki chalisek saal kii umr se pehle baccha paidaa karne kii koshish nahin kar rahe hai
 And as the woman's fertility decreases as she grows older, we are seeing increasing numbers of people trying to conceive

 Meanwhile, the IIPS study raises fears that increasing fertility cases may lead to medicalization of fertility, new problems and treatments, new cycles of expectancy and hopelessness, and technology to produce babies

 kya saarvajanik swasthya ke liye isse badi koi or chunauti ho sakati he? Does Narendra Modi need a big wave from 2014 to re-win the charisma? Do people not choose the government but change it?

 For this one has to embark on an election journey of the latest economic history of India
 is safar ke liye jaruri sajo-saamaan kuch is prakaar hai:▪ gujarat, punjab, karnataka, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, rajasthan, telugana ke taaja chunaav nattejey
 Gujarat and Karnataka are industry-export-agro-mineral-service based economies while agriculture has a major share in the economies of Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Telangana
 chhattisgarh krishi va khanij aadhaarit or rajasthan seva va krishi aadhaarit rajya hai
 These states are samples of other economies of the country
 ▪ pichley ek dashak main, gramin mazdooree, aarthik vikaas, krishi vikaas dar ke aankade or chunaav nattejey saath rakhane honge
 380 About 380 Lok Sabha seats in India are completely rural, of which 86 seats are in the states whose latest results are before us
 rajyon ke aarthik or krishi vikaas kii roshni main vidhansabha nateezon ko dekhne par teen nishkarshhath lagate hai
 • In Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, the economic growth rate in the year of election was less than the average of last five years (CRISIL report)
 gujarat main bhaajapa mushkil se satta main lauti
 In other states, the victory was reversed, while in some states there was no opposition or was awake late
 jahaan mandi kaa asar gaharaa tha jaise chhattisgarh, vahaan inkaar zyada tikhaa tha
 That is, people's decisions were based on the work of governments, not on promises
 • 2015-16 ke baad (chunaav se ek yaa do saal pehle) uparokt sabhi rajyon main krishi vikaas dar main giravat ai
 The latest data on the reduction in the rural wage rate across the country and the decline in the gross agricultural growth rate
 • 2014 ke baad jin rajyon main satta badali he vahaan chunavi saal ke aasapaas rajya kii aarthik va krishi vikaas dar ghati he
 Telangana (bihar and Bengal too) are exceptions where the growth rate was above the five-year average
 yahaan kheti kii surat desh kii tulana main thikthak thi isliye nattejey sarkaar ke mafik rahe
 In light of these figures, what does the scenario of Lok Sabha elections look like
 • kheti mahakme ke mutabik, desh ke 11 rajyon main kheti kii haalat thik nahin he
 Among these, Haryana, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh have received less than normal rainfall in the last three to five years
 bihar, andhra pradesh or bengal aise bade rajya hai jahaan kheti kii museebataan desh ke anya hisson se kuch kam hai
 • The recession can be prevented by putting huge resources in the rural economy
 upie ne 2004 ke baad gramin arthvyavastha main baari nivesh kiya tha, vaisaa hi kuch telugana main sarkaar ne kiya
 An investigation into the Modi government's budgets shows that the government's support to the rural economy between 2015 and 2018 was lower than it was five years before
 gramin mandi kaa siyaasi asar dekhakar 2017 ke baad rajyon main karj maaf hue or centre ne samarthan mulya badhaayaa
 Farmers cash assistance is also a result of this
 lekin shaayad der ho chuki he or krishi sankat zyada gaharaa he
 With the exception of voters, this trend has been shown in most of the elections held since 1995
 jin rajyon main aarthik yaa krishi vikaas dar thik thi vahaan sarkarein laut ain
 In the decade after 2000, the highest number of governments in the states was repeated as it was the best period of agriculture and economic development
 2004 ke chunaav main votaron ke faisle par sookhaa or krishi main mandi kaa asar dikhaai diya (rajg kii paraajay)
 While UPA was re-elected at the Center in 2009 despite inflation
 2014 main bhrashtachar ke alaava kheti kii badahaali sarkaar palatney kii ek badi vajah thi
 Economic data is evidence that voters' prudence has also increased in proportion to the cleverness of leaders
 log apni jin dagi kii surat dekhakar batan dabaate hai

 maamle main main twist sibiai kii disambar 2010 kii closer report ke baad aayaa or cese band hone kii bajaay phir se khul gaya
 The trial court considered it sufficient to prosecute the Talwar couple and issued a bailable warrant against Rajesh Talwar

 The bench had said that there was nothing wrong in the Ghaziabad magistrate's order to take cognizance against them (talwar couple) and prosecute them as the trial court judge issued the order after deliberating
 uttar pradesh police ne is maamle kii shuruyaat main jaanch kii or 23 may 2008 ko arushi ke pita ko giraftaar kar liya
 Later, the investigation of the case was handed over to the CBI on 29 May 2009 and Rajesh got bail from the Ghaziabad court on 11 July 2008
 sibiai ne dhai saal se bhi adhik samay tak is maamle kii jaanch karne ke baad gajiabad vishesh sibiai adaalat main maamle ko band karne kii report saunpte hue kaha ki vah talwaar danpati ko abhiyojit karne ke liye koi bhi saboot hasil karne main aksham rahi he
 However, the lower court dismissed the CBI report of the closure of the case, stating that the agency's report had prima facie material to prosecute them for their alleged involvement in the double murder
 magistrate ne is maamle main sangyaan liya or nau farvari 2011 ko talwaar dampati ko saman jari kiya
 Rajesh and Nupur (aarushi's parents) then moved the Allahabad High Court, which refused to dismiss the summons of the lower court and the proceedings initiated against them

 As soon as Anandiben Patel wrote on social media on Monday that she now wants to step down from the post of Chief Minister, the political corridor of Gujarat was hit
 pichley do din main anandiben patel jis tarah ek ke baad ek sarkari yojanaon ko lekar ghoshnaaen kar rahi thim, har koi yahi soch rahaa hoga ki mukhyamantri ye kar kya rahi hai
 Anandiben took 4 major decisions in two days, through which she tried to create a positive image of herself
 pehle to unhone gujarat main sabhi choti gadiyon par toll tex khatm karne kaa farmaan sunaaya to duusari badi ghoshnaa patidaaron ko lekar bhi kii gai jisamen unhone patidaar andolan ke dauraan kiye gaye dangon ke cese main 90 fisadi maamle waapas lene kaa faisla kiya
 The third major decision brought happiness for 8 lakh government and retired government employees, with Anandiben announcing the implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission from August 1, and the fourth announcement before writing his post on Facebook today with more than 80 percent marks
 Announced to provide free higher education to the bringing students
 aaie jaanate hai ki wo koun si paristhitiyaan baniin, jinke chalate anandiben ko apane istife kaa elaan karnaa padaa
 1) Patidar Reservation Movement In the last one year, the Patidar Reservation Movement in Gujarat had questioned the role of Chief Minister Anandiben Patel
 2002 ke dangon ke baad pehali baar patidaar andolan ke dauraan gujarat main karfu laga jo ki anandiben patel ke liye ek bada jhatka mana ja rahaa tha
 Also, the army had to deploy to control the Patidars
 patidaar andolan jab ugr hua to jagah jagah bijepi ke khilaaf narebaaji hui
 The infighting of the BJP also came out during the Patidar movement, which brought the Anandiben government to the limelight
 yahaan tak ki sarkaar patidaaron se sulah kaa koi jariya bhi nahin dhund pai
 2) Cold War was going on between Anandiben and Shah since the formation of Chief Minister of Waruandiben between him and BJP National President Amit Shah
 anandiben or shah ek manch par ek saath aana pansad nahin karte the
 Even if they came, the distance between them was clearly visible
 isi bich nikaay chunaav main anandiben or shah ke gut ke bich tikat bantwaare ko lekar bhi kaaphi bavaal hua tha
 Due to this, the BJP also suffered a lot in the civic elections
 3) parivaarwaad kaa aropanandiben patel ke liye kaha jaataa tha ki unki sarkaar unke bete-beti chalaate hai
 He was also accused of wrongly giving crores of forest land to his daughter, Anar Patel, to his daughter
 anandiben patel kii beti ko jameen dene ke mudde ko congress ne is kadar uchhaala ki centre main maujuud modi sarkaar ko jawaab dena padaa
 4) Dalit movement: After the Patidar agitation, the way the Gaurakshakas beat up the Dalits in Maya in Gujarat and Mayawati raised the issue in Parliament, the Anandiben government once again came on the backfoot
 anandiben sarkaar ne aanan fanan main is cese kii jaanch siaidi ko saunp di, lekin sarkaar kuch or thos kadam uthaati, dalit samudaay ke log sadakon par utar gaye or 25 se zyada logon ne sarkaar kaa virodh karte hue aatmahatya kaa prayaas kiya
 Even if there was a Dalit Maha Sammelan in Gujarat, a large number of Dalits gathered there did not leave any stone unturned to surround the Anandiben Patel government
 5) 75 kii age limitanandibenne apni fasebuk post par 75 saal kii umr kii party kii policy kii duhai dete hue kaha ki wo khud apni jimmedaari se hatana chaahati hai
 But this decision of Anandiben Patel, who was close to Narendra Modi, is also considered very important for the Modi government
 jaankaar yahi maan rahe hai ki anandiben kii ye fasebuk post achaanak nahin ai he, iske liye pradhanmantri ke jariye anandiben ko puri tarah bharose main liya gaya he ki anandiben ko koi badi jimmedaari di jaae
 Experts believe that Anandiben Patel can now be made the governor of a state
 haalanki iske baad aane vaale uparashtrapati ke chunaav ke liye bhi anandiben ke naam kaa prastaav bheja ja saktaa he
 By the way, it will be quite interesting to see what role the party has set for Anandiben as Chief Minister and especially Prime Minister Modi

 Bharti Ali, who works for women and child rights, said, 'A new law has been made in writing, but we want it to be followed on the ground
 kyonki is tarah ke majboot kanoon ke baavjood paristhitiyon main koi badlaav nahin aayaa he
 'he said,' It is not that there has been a sudden increase in such incidents, rather women are not sitting silent now
 jo bhi nae kanoon bane hai un par amal karne kaa samay aa gaya he, saath hi hamen peediton ko or adhik sangrakshan dene kii jarurat he
 Most of the time, when the lawyer talks to the victims in the context of the incident, the victims retreat

 The government has done nothing to protect women in the country

 Eminent activist Kamala Bhasin says that some positive changes have been seen after 16 December 2012, but this is only at the level of police, law and media
 bhasin ne kaha, ‘lekin police, kanoon or media bhi aparaadh hone ke baad hi saamne aate hai
