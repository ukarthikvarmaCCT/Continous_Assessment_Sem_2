 Political experts and open poll may undoubtedly predict the Janata dal-secular (JDS) to be the kingmaker in the event of a hung assembly in Karnataka, but former state chief minister and party state president HD Kumaraswamy has something else to say
 kumaraswami ko pakkaa vishwaas he ki bijepi, congress or jedies ke bich 12 may ko hone vaali chunavi jang main unki party kingmekar nahin balki king ke taur par ubharegi
 Kumaraswamy, son of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda, said in an exclusive interview with India Today that he is working hard to reach the magic figure of 113 seats and the JDS will win the election with an absolute majority
 bataa den ki 224 sadasyeey karnataka vidhansabha main bahumat ke liye 113 siton kii aavashyaktaa he
 Kumaraswamy said, 'this is not a hollow claim when i say i will get a majority
 main puri tarah aashwast hum
 Right now the people of Karnataka are going to bless me
 unhone siddharmaiya or yediurappa donon ko dekh liya he
 'is there a possibility that Kumaraswamy's seats should increase so much that he crosses the majority mark? In response to this question, Kumaraswamy said, 'this time for me
 pichhali baar maine kamjor aarthik sthiti kii vajah se 38 se zyada seat 300 se 3000 vot ke maamuli antar se khoi thim
 This time we have taken decisions taking lessons from the mistakes made in the last two elections
 ’kumaranna (kumaraswami ko isi naam se unke prashansak jaanate hai) ko kyon itnaa bharosa he ki wo king sabit honge jabaki raajnneetik jaankaar or opinian pole unke kingmekar hone kaa anumaan laga rahe hai? is sawaal ke jawaab main kumaraswami ne kaha, ‘puraa karnataka ye nahin kah rahaa he ki main kingmekar huunga
 Actually people want me to become king to rule the state for the next 5 years
 ’kumaraswami ne is baat se inkaar kiya ki jedies sirf old mysoreu main majboot he, baaki karnataka main nahin
 Kumaraswamy said, "it is not so, it is wrong from the political experts to infer that JDS is strong only in Old Mysuru
" hakeekat ye he ki hamane uttari karnataka main bhi khud ko majboot kiya he
 According to Kumaraswamy, this agricultural-dominated region is in a bad shape and all this is due to the policies of the state and central government
 kumaraswami ne kaha, ‘zyaadaatar log krishi par nirbhar hai
 They want to see a person in the CM chair who protects their interests and they have seen that in me
 is baar, kisaan jedies ko vot karne ja rahe hai
 Kumaraswamy has previously worked closely with the BJP
 2006 main unhone pita devegoda ke saath vidroh kar bijepi ke saath karnataka main gathbandhan sarkaar banaai thi
 When asked about his past experience of working with the BJP, he mentioned how Yeddyurappa, his deputy CM at the time, wanted to leave the BJP
 purv mukhyamantri kumaraswami ne kaha, ‘yediurppa bijepi chhodana chaahate the
 He told me to join the cabinet as a cabinet minister
 tab maine unhen salaah di thi ki party mat chodo nahin to apni pahchaan kho doge
 Along with him some mlas also wanted to leave the BJP
 maine unhen salaah di thi ki in vidhayakon ko apane bharose main lo
 He (yeddyurappa) forgot my advice
 maine bijepi ke saath haath apane vidhayakon ke dabaav kii vajah se milaayaa tha
 Kumaraswamy also mentioned how a BJP leader had alleged that he had taken a bribe of Rs 150 crore from mining agents (G
 Janardhana Reddy, the prime accused in the Bellary mining scam)
 kumaraswami ne kaha ki us vakt bijepi kaa koi netaa unke bachaav main saamne nahin aayaa tha
 Kumaraswamy said, 'they (BJP leaders) kept quietly watching how my image was being tarnished
 ek bijepi mantri ne to yahaan tak aarope lagaaya tha ki maine uski hatya ke liye supaari di thi
 i don't want to go with anyone anymore (neither with Congress, nor with BJP)
 kumaraswami ke mutabik unhone ateet main bijepi ke saath isliye haath milaayaa tha kyonki congress unki party ko khatm karnaa chaahati thi
 Both Congress and BJP are enemies
 kumaraswami ne pita devegoda se kisi tarah ke matbhed kii baat se inkaar kiya
 He said that his father and his views on any possible political alliance are the same
 kumaraswami ne kaha, koi matbhed nahin he
 We will take a unanimous decision in the election
 mere pita mere bos hai
 Deve Gowda's statement that he and his family would break up with Kumaraswamy if he again joined hands with the BJP
 is par kumaraswami ne kaha, 12 saal pehle jo maine faisla liya tha wo raajnneetik dabaav main liya tha
 He (deve Gowda) may have given that statement in that context
 lekin mujhe us faisle par khed nahin he kyonki maine wo faisla apni party ko congress se bachaane ke liye kiya tha
 It helped me strengthen the party in the state
 lekin kya jedies ko bahumat nahin miltaa to kumaraswami ghar par baithenge or kya raajnneeti main sab kuch mumkin nahin he? is sawaal ke jawaab main kumaraswami ne kaha, ‘sambhaavna ho sakati he lekin ham ise teen din main badal sakate hai
 We are working hard to achieve the magical figure of 113 seats
 hamen purna bahumat milegaa
 Kumaraswamy attacked Prime Minister Modi for saying that on one hand he praised Deve Gowda and then appealed to people not to spoil their vote by voting for JDS
 kumaraswami ne kaha ki karnataka ke matadaata modi ko gambhirtha se nahin le rahe hai
 Kumaraswamy said, 'I have been watching my honorable Prime Minister
 meri reliyon main unki raily se zyada log aate hai
 BJP gives 300 to 500 rupees to every person attending the rally
 hamen apni reliyon main logon ke laane ke liye unhen paise baantne kii jarurat nahin padati
 He attends JDS rallies because he loves us

 When you open the fridge gate of your home, you must first see eggs placed in a plastic rack in the fridge gate
 kyonki aam taur par dekha jaataa he ki frij ke get main andey rakhane ke liye ek khaas jagah hoti he, or ham log usee jagah andey rakhte hai
 Because we think it is the best and safe place to lay eggs
 lekin aapako yah jaanakar jarur hairaani hogi ki frij kii egg rack main rakhe andey aapaki sehat liye bahut nuksaandaayak hote hai
 Know why there is a loss: According to the vilatka of 'space Station', laying eggs in a plastic rack made in the refrigerator is the most dangerous
 vilataka kii maane tofrij ke get main andey rakhanese wo jaldi kharaab ho jate hai
 The main reason for this is that because of repeated opening and closing of the fridge, the temperature of the things kept in the gate changes and this causes the eggs to deteriorate
 jis vajah se frij ke get main rakhe andey khaane se sehat par bahut bura asar padataa he
 What to do: You do not need to panic
 aondo ko frij kaa get chhodakandar kahin bhi rakh sakate hai
 If you are afraid of breaking eggs, then you can put eggs in a box and keep it inside the refrigerator
 aisa karne se andey kharaab bhi nahin honge or aapaki sehat bhi bani rahegi

 ab ve use tamaasha kah rahe hai
 This is political compulsion
 " unhone tikhe swar main kaha ki pehle ve jiesti ko apni (congress) dein bataate the lekin ab ve ab uskaa hi virodh kar rahe hai
 On the other hand, the Congress has claimed that in 2011, the then BJP President Nitin Gadkari was ready to support the GST but it was stopped by the then Chief Minister of Gujarat Narendra Modi and Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 puure desh ke vyapaariyon dwaara jiesti kaa virodh kiye jane ke sambandh main sawaal poochne par gadakari ne kaha ki isse unhen phayda hoga or centre tath rajyon ke rajasav main badhotaree hogi

 rajeev ne apana jurm kubul karte hue bataaya ki usne apni beijjati kaa badla lene ke liye brahmajit kii hatya kii sajeesh rachi
 Rajiv called for this by getting a sim with fake ID and Brahmajit was called on the pretext of showing the land
 brahmajit apni gaadi se jameen dekhne rajeev ke paas pahunchaa
 But Rajiv got Brahmajit's car parked near Milan Farm House on National Highway 2
 iske baad rajeev or uski patni swati ne apni breja car main brahmajit ko bithaaya or jameen dikhaane nikal pade
 Rajiv had put a fake number plate on his Brezza car
 brahmajit ko lekar ve deeg gaanv pahunche or plan ke mutabik swati use nahar ke us paar kii jameen dikhaane lagi
 Meanwhile, Rajiv shot 3 bullets in Brahmajit's neck and head from behind
 phir hatyare danpati ne brahmajit kii laash vahaan pehle se hi khode hue 10 feet gahare gadde main daalkar JCB mashin se mitti se bharva diya

 At the same time, he warned the workers not to become 'for-sale products'
 mayawati ne party kaaryakartaaon kii ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki ve sunishchit karen ki agle aam chunaav main basapa ko badi jeet mili taaki vah khud pradhanmantri ke rup main laal kila se swatantraaa diwas bhaashan de saken
 He cautioned the party cadres to be vigilant against such forces which might try to 'corrupt' them in the assembly and Lok Sabha elections
 ’ unhone aagaah kiya, ‘ve bikaoo utpaada nahin bane

 He alleged that Congress could have appointed competent counsel in the case related to continuation of reservation in promotion
 lekin usne aisa nahin kiya
 Addressing a rally of party workers, Mayawati said that they should ensure that the BSP wins a big victory in the next general election so that he can deliver his Independence Day speech from the Red Fort as the Prime Minister himself
 unhone party caderon ko aagaah kiya ki ve aisi takaton se sajag rahen jo vidhansabha or loksabhaa chunaavon main unhen ‘bhrasht karne kaa prayaas kar sakati hai
 'he warns,' They should not become a salable product

 We realize this and realize that former Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif has been jailed for ten years and this is a big news and we will come to that, but in the eyes of all those despairing eyes, the big news is what is his own news

 Have you ever seen the picture of the flock when 4000 Urdu teachers were on the streets of Lucknow on May 14 and 15 for their appointment letter
 disambar 2016 main us vakt kii sapa sarkaar ne 16,460 shikshakon kii bhartee kaa aadesh jari kiya tha
 Out of this there were 4000 Urdu teachers and 12460 other teachers whom you must have heard many times in prime time
 nai sarkaar banane se pehle 22 or 23 march ko inaki bhi counselling ho gai thi magar 23 may ko nai sarkaar aane ke baad samiksha ke naam par sari prakriya roak di gai
 Urdu teachers have a post in government schools, the same was to be restored
 in sabhi ke paas bhi 12460 shikshakon kii tarah basic teaching certificate he
 Thirty percent of the 4000 Urdu teachers are non-muslims
 inamen se 720 pad anusuchit jati or janajati ke liye arakshit hai
 You will feel that it is not happening due to religion, but if religion is due, then in the 12460 BTC teachers do not sit on 8000 dharna so that they too get appointment letters
 paune do lakh shiksha mitron main sabhi dharmon ke log hai phir bhi inaki maang par kisi kaa dhyaan nahin he
 These people also raised slogans of Vande Mataram, also called Bharat Mata ki Jai, invoked everyone, remembered everyone but did not get reinstated
 ek minute ke liye sochie, agar koi sarkaar aapkaa chayan kare, adaalat se do do baar us chayan par muhar lage to kya niyukti patr nahin mil janaa chahie? 12640 shikshakon ke saath bhi yahi hua
 He too has won twice from the High Court but not all have joined yet
 isi 3 november 2017 ko hoicourt se urdu shikshak bhi cese jeet gaye
 The UP government moved to the division bench on 28 November but lost the case on 12 April 2018
 adaalat ne kaha ki 2 maah ke bheetar in chaar hazaar urdu shikshakon kii abhi tak jwining nahin hui he
 The two-month limit was reached on 12 June 2018
 ab agar adaalat kaa aadesh lagu nahin ho saktaa to sochie janata kahaan jaaegi
 It is not that the Chief Minister of the state Yogi Adityanath does not meet or talk to him
 22 june ko mukhyamantri ne urdu shikshakon se mulaakaat kii thi, is mulaakaat ko hasil karne ke liye in naujavaanon ko mantri anupama jaisawal ke ghar ke baahar dharne par baithna padaa tha
 On 4 and 8 June, these people also staged a sit-in
 mukhyamantri se mulaakaat to hui magar 22 june ke baad 6 july aa gaya, kuch bhi hone yaa kiye jane kaa ab tak pataa nahin chalaa he
 The Chief Minister had assured immediate action, perhaps his book would have meant nothing for 15 days
 twitor par zindaabad murdaabaad karnaa aasaan hota he, sadak par utar kar lathi khate hue zindaabad murdaabaad karke dekhie
 There is no hearing on legitimate requests
 janata hi janata se bekabar rahane lage to iskaa nuksaan har tarah kii janata se hoga kyonki jab aapaki baari aegi to aapke saath bhi ye system vaisaa hi karegaa jo in lakhon logon ke saath kar rahaa he
 So you see what can happen to you
 aise log pradarshan na karen to lagegaa hi nahin ki bharat main loktantr zindaa he
 In my opinion, all of you citizens should demand the right that the government should provide facilities for demonstration
 dharna pradarshan kar aap loktantr par ahsaan karte hai, janata ke baaki hisson ko bharosa dete hai ki abhi ham zindaa hai
 The democracy of India should thank these people that they have all come to Delhi from Azamgarh and Ghazipur districts of UP
 900 kimi kii railyatra isliye ki taaki ve pradhanmantri modi tak apni awaz pahunchaa saken
 These people stayed here for four days while dragging themselves on the rough ground of Ramlila Maidan in Delhi that someone will come who will listen to them and will reach the Prime Minister
 bibhori paal dekh nahin sakate hai magar dilli ne bhi to inhen nahin dekha
 From Bhikaipur, Babura village, 200 people, out of which around 100 were women and around 70-80 people who were given a new name by the Prime Minister but they did not get their rights
 kaleje ko thodaa majboot kiijie to aap dekh paaenge ki loktantr main awaz ke pahunchane main inaki aasthaa kitni majboot hogi ki ye dilli tak aae, kitni udaasi lekar laute honge ki kisi ne awaz hi nahin suni
 Women came because not all are getting widow pension
 shaareerik chunautiyon kaa saamana karte hue ye log system kii chunautiyon se isliye bhidane aae the ki inke paas shauchalay nahin he
 If our colleague Sushil Mahapatra had not looked at them, he would not have got a chance to say a very serious thing through them
 aapako pataa hi nahin chalata ki system ke bheetar kitni sadan aa gai he ki wo nagarikon ko keede makode samajhane laga he
 The same word was used by a gentleman
 kaha ki jab duusare ke khet main shauchalay ke liye jate hai tab log maarthe hai
 When the officers go to the toilet to ask, they are treated like insects
 ab agar gaanvon se garib log dilli dharna dene aaenge to kya unase 5000 rupaya liya janaa chahie? pehle jantar mantar par muft main dharna pradarshan hota tha, vahaan se hataakar ramlila maidan bhej diya gaya magar ek nai shart ke saath ki dharna dene ke liye fees deni hogi
 Had politics not been so shameless, it would have passed legislation from Parliament that the right to picket is a democratic right
 dharna dene par sarkaar aapako maandey degi
 The people of these political parties themselves surround each other's houses and keep coming on TV, but the common people had to pay 5000 rupees to picket, why this question should not be thought of
 susheel mahapatra ko bhi pataa nahin chalata agar in garib logon ke saath samarthan dene aae ek dilli vaale ne paise maang rahe adhikari kaa virodh na kiya hota
 The comments hamaare dimaag main ek sawaal or aayaa
 There is no toilet in the village of Ghazipur, but was there a toilet for these people in Ramlila Maidan? These people told that the toilet there was closed, so taking a lot of trouble went to the distant toilet where they used to pay five rupees
 susheel mahapaatr dobaaraa ramlila maidan gaye, yah dekhne ke liye ki shauchalay kaa kya intazaam he
 After leaving here, Sushil met another family
 yah parivaar dilli kaa hi he or pichley aath dinon se yahaan dharne par baitha he
 His shop is devastated, yet after cutting five thousand slips, he is staging a sit-in here
 sawaal simpal he
 When the government is taking money, then why does the government not come to hear from them
 kya paise lene ke baad sarkaar ko sunne kii guarantee nahin deni chahie? Sushil Mahapatra tried to talk to the officials associated with the management of Ramlila Maidan but no one was ready to talk on camera
 yahi bataaya ki paanch hazaar jo liya jaataa he wo baad main waapas ho jaataa he
 Now you think aap sarkaar ke paas gaye hai yaa soodakhor ke paas gaye hai
 Give five thousand to picket which will be returned after picketing, you did not feel strange to hear
 kya aapaki nazaron se us hujum kii tasviir kabhi guzari he jab 14 or 15 may ke din lakhanu main 4000 urdu shikshak apni niyukti patr ke liye tapati garmi main sadakon par the
 In December 2016, the then SP government issued an order to recruit 16,460 teachers

 They were also counseled on 22 and 23 March before the new government was formed, but after the new government came on 23 May, the entire process was stopped in the name of review
 sarkari skulon main urdu shikshakon kaa pad hota he usee kii bahaali honi thi
 All of them also have Basic Teaching Certificate like 12460 teachers
 4000 urdu shikshakon main se tees pratishat gair muslim hai

 aapako lagegaa ki dharm ke kaaran nahin ho rahaa magar dharm kaaran hota to 12460 beatisi shikshakon main 8000 dharne par nahin baithe rahete ki unhen bhi niyukti patr mil jaae
 There are people of all religions in twenty two lakh education friends, yet their demand is unnoticed
 in logon ne vandemaataram ke naare bhi lagaae, bharat mata kii jai bhi kaha, sabakaa aahvaan kiya, sabko yaad kiya magar bahaali nahin hui
 Think for a minute, if a government chooses you, should the appointment be confirmed twice by the court, should not the appointment letter be received? The same happened with 12640 teachers
 unhen bhi do-do baar hai court se jeet mili he magar abhi tak sabhi kii jwining nahin hui he
 On 3 November 2017, Urdu teachers also won the case from the High Court
 upi sarkaar 28 november ko division bench chali gai magar 12 april 2018 ko sarkaar mukadmaa haar gai
 The court said that within four months these four thousand Urdu teachers have not yet joined
 12 june 2018 ko do maah kii seemaa puri ho gai
 Now if the court order cannot be implemented, then think where the public will go
 aisa nahin he ki rajya ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath inase mulaakaat yaa baat nahin karte hai
 On June 22, the Chief Minister met Urdu teachers, to get the meeting, these youth had to sit on a dharna outside the house of Minister Anupama Jaiswal
 4 or 8 june ko bhi in logon ne dharna diya tha
 i met the Chief Minister but after 22 June, 6 July came, nothing has been known or done yet
 mukhyamantri ne turant karrwai kaa aashwaasan diya tha, shaayad unki kitaab kaa matlab 15 din kuch nahin hota hoga
 It is easy to do Jindabad Murdabad on Twitter, see Jindabad Murdabad by getting sticks on the road
 jaays maaghon par bhi sunwaayee nahin he
 If the public starts to remain oblivious to the public, then it will suffer from all kinds of people because when your turn comes, this system will do the same to you, which is doing to these millions
 isliye aap dekhie ki aapke saath kya-kya ho saktaa he
 If such people do not protest then it will not seem that democracy is alive in India
 meri raay main aap sabhi nagarikon ko is baat kaa adhikaar maangana chahie ki dharna pradarshan ke liye sarkaar suvidhaayen uplabdh karaae
 By demonstrating, you owe democracy, you trust the rest of the people that we are still alive
 bharat ke loktantr ko in logon kaa shukriya adaa karnaa chahie ki ye sabhi upi ke azamgarh or gajipur zile se chalakar dilli aae hai
 The journey of 900 km is so that they can convey their voice to Prime Minister Modi
 dilli ke ramlila maidan kii khurduri zamin par khud ko khinchate hue ye log is aas main chaar dinon tak yahaan rahe ki koi to aayega jo unki baat sunegaa or pradhanmantri tak pahunchaa degaa
 Bibhori Pal can not see, but even Delhi did not see them
 bhikaipur, babura gaanv se 200 log jinamein se 100 ke kareeb mahilaayein thim or 70-80 ke kareeb wo log jinhen pradhanmantri ne nayaa naam to de diya magar un tak unka haq nahin pahunchaa
 If you strengthen the heart a little, you will see how strong their faith will be in reaching the voice in democracy that they have come to Delhi, how sad they must have returned that no one heard the voice
 mahilaayein isliye ain thim ki sabhi ko vidhwaa pension nahin mil rahaa he
 Facing physical challenges, these people came to face the challenges of the system because they do not have toilets
 hamaare sahyogi susheel mahapatra kii nazar in par na padi hoti to inke zarie ek behad gambhir baat kehane kaa mauka nahin miltaa
 You do not know how much rottenness has taken place within the system that it has started treating citizens as insects
 thik isi shabd kaa istemaal kiya ek sajjan ne
 Said that people kill when they go to the toilet in another farm
 jab adhikari ke paas shauchalay maangane jate hai tab inase keede makode kii tarah bartaav kiya jaataa he
 Now if poor people from villages come to sit in Delhi, should 5000 rupees be taken from them? Earlier, there was a free sit-in demonstration at Jantar Mantar, it was removed and sent to Ramlila Maidan, but with a new condition that fees would have to be paid for picketing
 raajnneeti itani besharm na hui hoti to sansad se kanoon paas karti ki dharna dene kaa adhikaar loktantric adhikaar he
 The government will give you an honorarium for picketing
 khud ye raajnneetik dal ke log ek duusare ke gharon ko gherte rahete hai or tivi par aate rahete hai magar aam logon ko dharna dene ke liye 5000 rupee dene pade, is sawaal par kyon nahin sochaa janaa chahie
 Even Sushil Mahapatra would not have known if a Delhiite who had come to support these poor people, would not have opposed the officer asking for money
 tippaniyan One more question came to our mind
 gajipur ke gaanv main to shauchalay nahin he lekin ramlila maidan main kya in logon ke liye shauchalay kaa intazaam kiya gaya tha? in logon ne bataaya ki vahaan kaa shauchalay band tha, isliye kaaphi takalif uthaate hue dur ke shauchalay main gaye jahaan paanch rupee dekar istemaal kiya
 Sushil Mahapatra went to Ramlila Maidan again to see what the toilet was all about
 yahaan se nikalne ke baad susheel kii mulaakaat ek or parivaar se hui
 This family belongs to Delhi and has been sitting here on dharna for the last eight days
 inaki dukaan ujaad gai he phir bhi paanch hazaar kii parchi kataakar yahaan dharna de rahe hai
 The question is simple
 jab sarkaar paisa le rahi he to phir sarkaar inase sunne kyon nahin aati he
 Shouldn't the government be guaranteed to listen after taking money? susheel mahapatra ne ramlila maidan ke prabandhan se jude adhikariyon se baat karne kaa prayaas kiya magar camere par baat karne ke liye koi taiyaar nahin hua
 It is said that the five thousand which are taken are returned later
 ab aap sochie
 You have gone to the government or to the usurer
 dharna dene ke liye paanch hazaar dijie jo dharne ke baad waapas ho jayega, sunakar aapako ajeeb nahin laga

 Sushil Mahapatra went to Ramlila Maidan again to see what the toilet was all about
 yahaan se nikalne ke baad susheel kii mulaakaat ek or parivaar se hui
 This family belongs to Delhi and has been sitting here on dharna for the last eight days
 inaki dukaan ujaad gai he phir bhi paanch hazaar kii parchi kataakar yahaan dharna de rahe hai
 The question is simple
 jab sarkaar paisa le rahi he to phir sarkaar inase sunne kyon nahin aati he

 It is said that the five thousand which are taken are returned later
 ab aap sochie
 You have gone to the government or to the usurer
 dharna dene ke liye paanch hazaar dijie jo dharne ke baad waapas ho jayega, sunakar aapako ajeeb nahin laga
 It is not that the Chief Minister of the state Yogi Adityanath does not meet or talk to him
 22 june ko mukhyamantri ne urdu shikshakon se mulaakaat kii thi, is mulaakaat ko hasil karne ke liye in naujavaanon ko mantri anupama jaisawal ke ghar ke baahar dharne par baithna padaa tha
 On 4 and 8 June, these people also staged a sit-in
 mukhyamantri se mulaakaat to hui magar 22 june ke baad 6 july aa gaya, kuch bhi hone yaa kiye jane kaa ab tak pataa nahin chalaa he
 The Chief Minister had assured immediate action, perhaps his book would have meant nothing for 15 days
 twitor par zindaabad murdaabaad karnaa aasaan hota he, sadak par utar kar lathi khate hue zindaabad murdaabaad karke dekhie
 There is no hearing on legitimate requests
 janata hi janata se bekabar rahane lage to iskaa nuksaan har tarah kii janata se hoga kyonki jab aapaki baari aegi to aapke saath bhi ye system vaisaa hi karegaa jo in lakhon logon ke saath kar rahaa he
 So you see what can happen to you
 aise log pradarshan na karen to lagegaa hi nahin ki bharat main loktantr zindaa he
 In my opinion, all of you citizens should demand the right that the government should provide facilities for demonstration
 dharna pradarshan kar aap loktantr par ahsaan karte hai, janata ke baaki hisson ko bharosa dete hai ki abhi ham zindaa hai
 The democracy of India should thank these people that they have all come to Delhi from Azamgarh and Ghazipur districts of UP
 900 kimi kii railyatra isliye ki taaki ve pradhanmantri modi tak apni awaz pahunchaa saken
 These people stayed here for four days while dragging themselves on the rough ground of Ramlila Maidan in Delhi that someone will come who will listen to them and will reach the Prime Minister
 bibhori paal dekh nahin sakate hai magar dilli ne bhi to inhen nahin dekha
 From Bhikaipur, Babura village, 200 people, out of which around 100 were women and around 70-80 people who were given a new name by the Prime Minister but they did not get their rights
 kaleje ko thodaa majboot kiijie to aap dekh paaenge ki loktantr main awaz ke pahunchane main inaki aasthaa kitni majboot hogi ki ye dilli tak aae, kitni udaasi lekar laute honge ki kisi ne awaz hi nahin suni
 Women came because not all are getting widow pension
 shaareerik chunautiyon kaa saamana karte hue ye log system kii chunautiyon se isliye bhidane aae the ki inke paas shauchalay nahin he
 If our colleague Sushil Mahapatra had not looked at them, he would not have got a chance to say a very serious thing through them
 aapako pataa hi nahin chalata ki system ke bheetar kitni sadan aa gai he ki wo nagarikon ko keede makode samajhane laga he
 The same word was used by a gentleman
 kaha ki jab duusare ke khet main shauchalay ke liye jate hai tab log maarthe hai
 When the officers go to the toilet to ask, they are treated like insects
 ab agar gaanvon se garib log dilli dharna dene aaenge to kya unase 5000 rupaya liya janaa chahie? pehle jantar mantar par muft main dharna pradarshan hota tha, vahaan se hataakar ramlila maidan bhej diya gaya magar ek nai shart ke saath ki dharna dene ke liye fees deni hogi
 Had politics not been so shameless, it would have passed legislation from Parliament that the right to picket is a democratic right
 dharna dene par sarkaar aapako maandey degi
 The people of these political parties themselves surround each other's houses and keep coming on TV, but the common people had to pay 5000 rupees to picket, why this question should not be thought of
 susheel mahapatra ko bhi pataa nahin chalata agar in garib logon ke saath samarthan dene aae ek dilli vaale ne paise maang rahe adhikari kaa virodh na kiya hota
 The comments hamaare dimaag main ek sawaal or aayaa
 There is no toilet in the village of Ghazipur, but was there a toilet for these people in Ramlila Maidan? These people told that the toilet there was closed, so taking a lot of trouble went to the distant toilet where they used to pay five rupees
 susheel mahapaatr dobaaraa ramlila maidan gaye, yah dekhne ke liye ki shauchalay kaa kya intazaam he
 After leaving here, Sushil met another family
 yah parivaar dilli kaa hi he or pichley aath dinon se yahaan dharne par baitha he
 His shop is devastated, yet after cutting five thousand slips, he is staging a sit-in here
 sawaal simpal he
 When the government is taking money, then why does the government not come to hear from them
 kya paise lene ke baad sarkaar ko sunne kii guarantee nahin deni chahie? Sushil Mahapatra tried to talk to the officials associated with the management of Ramlila Maidan but no one was ready to talk on camera
 yahi bataaya ki paanch hazaar jo liya jaataa he wo baad main waapas ho jaataa he
 Now you think aap sarkaar ke paas gaye hai yaa soodakhor ke paas gaye hai
 Give five thousand to picket which will be returned after picketing, you did not feel strange to hear
 twitor par zindaabad murdaabaad karnaa aasaan hota he, sadak par utar kar lathi khate hue zindaabad murdaabaad karke dekhie

 bharat or pakistan ke bich tanaav ke chalate thar express he bandanvaraatri main hinglaj mata ke darshan ke liye jane vaale bhakt maayusbharat-paak sambandhon main tanaav ke chalate band hui thar express ke kaaran hinglaj ke bhakt is baar sharadiya navaratri main pakistan nahin ja paa rahe
 In Navratri, worshipers of Hinglaj Mata from Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala and other states have been going to Balochistan in Pakistan for the last 13 years continuously to visit Shaktipeeth, but now this series has stopped
 hinglaj ke bhakton ke liye thar express saral or sugam saadhan rahaa he
 To visit Shaktipeeth in Navratri, we had to travel by this train, but this year the Thar Express is closed
 aise main bhakt sharadiya navaratri main hinglaj shaktipeeth nahin ja paae jisase unhen bahut hi malaal he
 Why did the Thar Express shut down? Worshipers say that Hinglaj-based mother had gone with former finance and foreign minister Jaswant Singh to visit Mata
 uske baad lagaataar 13 saalo se hinglaj mata ke darshan ke liye jate hai lekin is baar bharat-paak ke sambandhon main tanaav ke chalate thar express kaa sanchaalan nahin kiya ja rahaa he jisase maa ke darshan karne se vanchit rah gaye he
 This time the process of worshipers who have been known to visit Hinglaj Mata continuously for the last 13 years from Thar Express has broken
 lagaataar jane vaale bhakton ko is baar hinglaj mata ke darshan nahin karne kaa malaal he
 Worshipers used to leave for Hinglaj by this train before Navratri started
 vahiin, mandir main anushthan main shaamil hote tathaa vaapasi bhi thar express se karte the
 According to the operation of the weekly running Thar Express, Hinglaj devotees used to make their coming and going programs
 darasal thar express band hone se hinglaj mata ke darshan ke liye jane vaale upaskon kaa hi silsilaa nahin tutaa he balki sindh or hind kaa roti va beti kaa jo naata tha, vah bhi cat gaya he
 People are expecting the Thar Express to start again to meet their loved ones
 uttar pradesh ke shamali main beete saptaah police or badmaashon ke bich jabardast muthbhed hui thi, jisamen consteble ankit tomars shahid ho gaye the
 In the encounter, the police also killed the notorious criminal Sabir
 ankit kii shahadat kaa badla lete hue UP police ne 48 ghante ke andar gang ke ek or badmaash intjaar ko dhar dabocha
 On the night of January 2, what happened during the encounter, how the police found out the miscreants, how they surrounded the whole story, Shamli captain IPS officer Ajay Sharma shared a post on his Facebook page
 ajay sharma kaa yah post bataata he ki police ke liye apni team ke kisi saathi ko khone kaa kya matlab hota he
 Ajay Sharma writes in his post that one evening a phone call comes and information is received about a big crime criminal
 is apradhi kaa gang 3 pulicekarmiyon kii hatya kar chukaa tha, jo pichley 7 maheene se jail le jate vakt police castady se janapad barabanki se faraar ho gaya tha
 a few years ago, he asked for extortion from a businessman, and he refused to give up and then escaped after killing two brothers
 apane khilaaf mukhabiri karne waalon ko maut kii neend sula di
 a total of 68 cases including 12 murder cases have been registered against this notorious criminal, including the Tanishq robbery case of 10 crores
 vah likhte hai, "jab soochna mili tab main ek sanstha ke navvarsh ke kaarykram main shariq ho rahaa tha
 Left him in the middle and gathered three reliable teams together
 jab bhi koi pulicekarmi kahin dabish dene jaataa he to uske andar sirf ek hi soch hoti he ki wo aparaadhi jo samaaj ke liye khatra bana hua he kisi prakaar usko giraftaar kar sake
 At that time, there is more society for him than his family
 agar wo aisa na sochen to shaayad ve kabhi aise aparaadhiyon ko na pakad paaen
 "ajay further writes that preparations were made for Dabish
 ranneeti banaai gai
 Arrived at the spot at about 10 o'clock
 andhera ho chukaa tha
 Everyone took their positions
 ek team jisamen jaanbaaj sipaahi ankit tomars tha, wo us kamare ko cover karne pahunchi or donon taraf se goliyaan chalin
 Ankit was shot in the head
 vah jameen par gira
 At that time, he must have thought about his parents and wife, 4-year-old girl and 4-month-old son, because the supply of blood of his brain had stopped after those few moments
 badmaash ke bhi goli lagi, lekin usne kudakar bhaagane kii koshish kii
 Where we had taken a position
 vahaan goliyaan donon taraf se chal rahi thim
 The miscreant was killed in the shootout, but while injuring another Jambaz
 kismat se vah jaanbaaj sipaahi khatre se baahar aa chukaa he
 He says that he brought his colleagues to the hospital
 ankit kii haalat gambhir thi or 24 ghante zindagi-maut ke bich sangharsh karne ke baad vah shahid ho gaya
 This was the biggest sacrifice of a policeman walking on the duty path
 apni team ke sadsy ko khona bahut bada nuksaan he
 For a captain to shoulder the body of his partner is the same as a father to his son
 yah dukh mahasoos karnaa bahut baari tha
 Like we won a battle by winning all the battles
 ishwar uski aatma ko shanti de
 You will always remain numbered in memory of your teammates
 bataate chalem ki 2 janvari ko badmaash sabir se hui muthbhed main ankit ke sir or chaati main goli lag gai thi
 He went into a coma due to a bullet in his brain
 unhen ventilator par rakhaa gaya
 Senior doctors of the country tried their best to get the bullet fired in Ankit's brain, but could not succeed
 bagpat main badot ke vajidpur nivasee ankit saal 2011 main upi police main bhartee hue the
 They were married in 2012
 unka paanch maheene kaa betaa or chaar saal kii beti he
 His father Jaipal told that Ankit was the eldest of his three children
 unki ek choti bahan or ek bhai hai
 This post by IPS officer Ajay Sharma is full of human sentiments and shows that the policemen are also ordinary people made of bone-meat, who are concerned about their colleagues and this society
 ajay sharma kaa yah post bataata he ki police kaa ek adana se adana sipaahi kis tarah apni jaan par khelkar is samaaj kii hifaazat karata he
 On January 4, Shaheed Ankit Tomar was given a final farewell with state honors amidst the slogans of Bharat Mata ki Jai in the crowd of thousands at Shamli police line
 upi sarkaar ne shahid ankit tomars ke parijanon ko 50 lakh rupee kii aarthik madad dene kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has announced financial support to his family members, praising the valor and courage of martyr soldier Ankit Tomar

 There has been a major terrorist attack in Paris, the capital of France
 golibari or dhamaakon main 150 se zyada logon ke maare jane kii khabar he
 Simultaneous attacks were carried out in several places in Paris
 paris main hui hinsak vaardaaton ke maddenjar france kii seemaa ko sil kar diya gaya he
 Emergency has also been announced in Paris
 lekin ham gaur karen to ye kaha ja saktaa he ki france aatankwaadi sanghathanon ke liye philhal target bana hua he
 Not only this, but in 2015, many more terrorist attacks have rocked this country
 is hamale ko jod len to is saal france main hone vaala ye chatha aatanki hamalaa he
 At the beginning of the year, Paris suffered a major terrorist attack
 7 janvari, 2015 ko paris main ekavyangy patrika charlie abdo ke daftar main hue aatanki hamalemen 20 logon kii jaan gai thi
 Chanting the slogan 'allahu Akbar', some masked journalists entered the office and started shooting indiscriminately
 hamale main chaar mukhya cartoonist or pradhan sampadak maare gaye the
 Subsequently, on 3 February 2015, 3 soldiers were attacked while guarding a Jewish community center in Nice
 lekin is hamale main kisi ke maare jane kii koi khabar nahin thi
 About two months later on April 19, 2 churches were attacked by an Algerian Jew
 jisamen 1 mahila kii maut hui
 On 26 June 2015, again in a gas factory in eastern France, a suspected Islamic attacker strangled and killed one person while injuring two others with explosive devices
 ek baar phir kareeb do maheene baad 21 agast 2015 ko baari hathiyaaron se las ek aatanki ne amsterdam se paris ja rahi ek hai speed train main firing kii, jisase kam se kam 4 log ghayal ho gaye
 a classicnikov, an automatic pistol, ammunition and other materials were recovered from the attacker
 janvari main hue charlie abdo ke baad bhale hi koi bada aatanki hamalaa nahin tha lekin ye sab sanket to de hi rahe the
 After all, all these were terrorist attacks or were they against humanity
 america ne purajor tareeke se in khabaron kaa khandan kiya ki videsh sthit uske mishnon main videshi karmchaariyon ko pratidin ek dollar se bhi kam kaa vetan diya jaataa he

 varsh 2009 kii videsh vibhaag ke mahanideshak karyaalay kii report ke bare main puche jane par videsh vibhaag kii pravaktaa amily horn ne kaha, yah sahi nahin he
 It was reported in the report that local employees hired by US diplomatic missions abroad receive less than a dollar a day
 unhone kaha, 1980 ke videsh seva adhinium kii dhara 408 ke anusaar hamaari muaavja yojanaayen rojgaar sambandhi sthaneey kshetra kii maujuuda vetan daron or muaavja yojanaon par aadhaarit hoti hai
 "we also distribute the benefits to the employees according to the existing traditions in any field," said Horn
 jin bazaaron main mudrasphiti adhik he yaa aarthik or raajnneetik asthirataa he, vahaan ham vetanon par kareeb se najar rakhte hai or usee ke anusaar unamem samaayojan karte hai
 Significantly, the US employs thousands of local staff to assist its diplomats in their foreign diplomatic missions

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi crossed his own Laxman Rekha on Friday
 jammu ke doda main ek chunavi sabha main unhone endie ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi par pehali baar vyaktigat hamalaa kiya
 Without naming Modi, Rahul said that he has contested many elections, but wrote for the first time that he is married
 patni kaa naam chhipate hai, lekin apana puraa jor ek mahila kii jasusi main laga dete hai
 While Rahul himself has been telling the people of his party for some time before that personal attacks should not be done on opposition leaders
 shaam hote-hote congress party ne isi mudde par chunaav ayog kaa darwaja khatkhata diya
 Law Minister Kapil Sibal told the commission that Modi hid his marital status in his old affidavits, so action should be taken against him and his elections should be stopped
 isse pehle, congress kii website par purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa photo lagaakar unke modi ko rajdharm kaa paalan karne kii naseehat dene vaale bayaan kii yaad dilaai gai
 After all, why in every election meeting, most of Rahul's speeches that talk about giving right to information, education, health and food, are now being concentrated in attacks on Modi
 kya vajah he ki congressi netaaon kii zyaada dilchaspee manaregaa or bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon ke bajaay narendra modi ke vaivaahik jivan main dikhaai dene lagi he
 Why are Congress leaders worrying more about the achievements of the 10 years of UPA rule than why LK Advani and Jaswant Singh did not get their due in the BJP? lagata he ki iske peeche badi vajah guuruuvaar ko hue tisare daur kaa matdaan he
 Of the 91 seats on Thursday, Congress has 45 seats, while the BJP has just 13 more votes and the feedback received has surprised all political parties
 aisa lag rahaa he ki pashchimi uttar pradesh, dilli, maharashtra, madhya pradesh, bihar aadi rajyon kii jin siton par matdaan hua, vahaan zyaadaatar logon ne congress ke khilaaf or modi ke samarthan main vot daale hai
 In many seats, people have voted on their election symbol without knowing who the BJP candidate is, saying that they want to vote directly for Modi
 yani in siton par 2009 ke parinaam ulatney kii sambhaavna vyakt kii ja rahi he
 Even in western Orissa, there are reports of BJP getting support
 vahaan bijepi ne congress ko peeche chhodte hue khud ko bijedy ke baad duusare number par khadaa kar liya he
 This was pointed out in all the opinion polls before the election, but the Congress continued to dismiss them
 magar tisare daur ke matdaan ke baad yah sambhaavna jor pakad rahi he ki kahin congress vaaki apane abhi tak ke sabase kharaab pradarshan kii taraf to nahin bad rahi he
 Earlier, the Congress got the lowest 114 Lok Sabha seats in 1999
 isse bhi kam hone kaa matlab hoga uski praasangikta par sawalia nishaanaa laganaa
 This would be a big blow for Rahul Gandhi personally, because the Congress is fighting this election keeping him ahead
 2009 ke chunaav main manmohan singh congress kaa cheharaa the, lekin is baar rahul gandhi hi congress kaa cheharaa hai or yah spasht he ki congress kii naakaami kaa thikra unheen ke sir phutegaa
 Perhaps this is the reason why the Congress is trying its best not to get its seats below the 1999 figure in any way
 par iske liye modi par vyaktigat hamale shuru karne kii congress kii ranneeti kitni kargar ho paaegi, yah abhi pakke taur par kah paanaa mushkil he
 Earlier, whenever Congress made personal attacks on Modi, Modi used him for his own benefit
 modi apni patni ke saath rahe hai yaa nahin rahe, unhone apni vaivaahik sthiti bataai yaa nahin bataai, ye ve vyaktigat baaten hai, jinase aam bhartiya matadaata kaa koi sarokaar nahin hota or na hi vot daalate vakt use in baton se fark padataa he
 Modi himself has not been behind in making such personal comments
 kuch maheenon pehle sonia gandhi kii beemaari or shashi tharur kii 'garlfriend' ke bare main tippanee karne ke liye unki tikhi aalochana hui thi
 It is of course that the voter never likes to throw mud on the personal life of any leader and he gives a befitting reply to those who do so
 2004 main sonia gandhi kaa videshi mul kaa mudda oochhaalane vaali bijepi or unke bare main behad bhaddi tippanee karne vaale pramod mahajan ko munh kii khaani padi thi or janata ne unhen baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya tha
 The mouths of those who called Indira Gandhi as 'dumb dolls' were also closed by the public and Advani, who described Manmohan Singh as the weakest prime minister, also responded
 sawaal yah he ki agar congress is sabase sikh na lete hue bhi agar apane prachaar abhiyaan ko patari se utaarne par tul gai he, to kya yah uski hataasha kaa pradarshan nahin he? Gadkari said that no compromise will be made on the pollution front either
 na hi is bare main uthaae gaye kadamon ko lekar kotahibarti jaaegi

 At first, i was a little nervous that i would not know how, but hesitation ended on the very first day
 ve kaaphi khuli hai or dostana ravaiya rakhti hai
 Befriended the queen
 dosti aisa labj he, jisaki har kisi ke liye alag ahmiyat hoti he
 i would say that working together for a long time gives an opportunity to understand each other, i do not know whether it should be called friendship or not
 bollywood main kaha jaataa he ki do heroinon ke bich dosti nahin hoti
 i also heard a lot about such things
 meri soch he ki kaam karnaa or dosti karnaa alag-alag he
 We do not work for friendship
 kaam karte hue dosti jaise rishte ban jaaen, to acha he, varanaa koi buree baat nahin
 Will work with Rani again
 yah kahana mushkil he
 Don't know who would want to make a film with both of us

 dhawan ne kaha, yadi koi 300 kaa lakshya lekar chale, to yah sambhav he
 i too had dreamed of scoring 200 runs, because i have such shots
 main 248 ran tak pahunchaa, yah badi uplabdhi he
 The left-handed batsman scored 248 runs from 150 balls with 30 fours and seven sixes in the league stage match against South Africa 'A' for India 'A' during the tri-series in South Africa, which India From the list, 'A' has the highest score
 vah haalanki england ke elistare brown ke 268 ran ke record ko todane se chook gaye
 Dhawan was asked if he knew the world record when he was batting, he said no
 
 
 mujhe sachin (tendulkar, 200 ran) or viru (virendra sahvaag ke 219 ran) paaji ke score ke bare main pataa tha
 i did not know that the record is of 268 runs
 is saal ke shuru main australia ke khilaaf mohali main 187 ran kii dhamaakedaar pari khelkar test cricket main padaarpan karne vaale dhawan ne kaha ki captain ke rup main mahendra singh dhoni kaa jawaab nahin he
 Dhawan admitted that there is a lot of competition in the Indian top order, but he does not think about it
 unhone kaha, pratispardhaa pehle bhi thi or vah hameshaa bani rahegi
 i do not think about it
 mujhe apana kaam karnaa he
 Today, Viru and Gotti (gautam Gambhir) brothers are trying to come back by doing well, so good

 He said, it will definitely benefit
 yah sahi he ki wicket main zyada ghaas nahin thi, lekin unamem oochaal thi
 It is important to adjust to the circumstances
 kai choti chijen myne rakhti hai
 The comments bharat or dakshin africa board ke bich matbhedon ke kaaran is daure par talwaar lataki hui he
 Dhawan said about this, it is not in my hands
 is par bisisiai ko faisla karnaa he
 i like to play matches and meanwhile we will also play against the West Indies
 australia ke khilaaf test cricket main padaarpan par kheli gai pari ko yaadgaar pari bataane vaale dhawan ne kaha ki unhone apane khel main kisi tarah kaa badlaav nahin kiya, lekin pichley chah maheenon main ek cricketer ke rup main vah kaaphi paripakv hue hai
 He said, i have matured as a cricketer and it is helping me a lot
 main apane pradarshan kaa puraa majaa letaa hum
 i can play all kinds of shots and this is my strong side

 He however missed breaking England's Alistair Brown's record of 268 runs
 dhawan se poocha gaya ki jab vah ballebaaji kar rahe the, tab kya unhen vishwa record kaa pataa tha, unhone kaha, nahin
 
 
 i knew about Sachin (tendulkar, 200 runs) and Viru (virender Sehwag's 219 runs) scores of Paji
 mujhe nahin pataa tha ki record 268 ran kaa he
 Dhawan, who made his debut in Test cricket by playing a blistering 187-run knock against Australia in Mohali earlier this year, said Mahendra Singh Dhoni as captain was not the answer
 dhawan ne mana ki bhartiya sheersh kram main kaaphi pratispardhaa he, lekin vah is bare main nahin sochate
 He said, the competition was there before and it will always be there
 main is bare main nahin sochataa
 i have to do my work aaj viru or gauti (gautam gambhir) bhai acha pradarshan karke vaapasi kii koshish kar rahe hai, to acha he
 Even when i was out, i used to think that i had to do well with them
 aisa chalata rahata he
 Dhawan, who has played one Test and 19 odis so far, said that the recently concluded tour of India 'A' during India's senior team's tour of South Africa will help
 unhone kaha, nishchit taur par phayda milegaa

 paristhitiyon se saamanjasy bithaana mahatvapurn hota he
 Many small things matter
 tippaniyan The sword hangs on this tour due to differences between India and the South African board
 is bare main dhawan ne kaha, yah mere haath main nahin he
 The BCCI has to decide on this
 mujhe match khelnaa pasand he or ham is bich west indies ke khilaaf bhi khelenge
 Dhawan, who described the innings played in Test cricket against Australia as a memorable innings, said that he did not make any changes in his game, but he has matured a lot as a cricketer in the last six months
 unhone kaha, main cricketer ke rup main paripakv hua he or isse mujhe kaaphi madad mil rahi he
 i enjoy my performance to the fullest

 unki film simba ne joardaar kamai kii
 After the incarnation of the police, he is now ready to make a place in people's hearts as a rapper through the film Gully Boy
 film ke gane pehle se hi kaaphi popular ho rahe hai
 In Uttar Pradesh, opposition parties have accused the Mayawati government of saving District Superintendent of Police Anil Das for allegedly threatening a 17-year-old Dalit girl who was raped in Banda, and demanded immediate action against them
 pratipakshi dalon kaa aarope lagaaya, ‘banda ke police adheekshak anil das ne jail main jaakar balaatkaar peedit ladki ko apane aarope waapas lene ke liye dabaav daalaa or use daraaya dhamkaaya tha
 Justice in this case would not have been complete without his suspension
 ’congress pravaktaa subodh shrivastav ne kaha, ‘haalanki, kanishtha police adhikariyon or jailer ko to nilambit kar diya gaya he
 But at the behest of the officer, the rape victim was being threatened and there is no action against him
 ’ unhone kaha ki kanpur balaatkaar cond main bhi rajya sarkaar kaa yahi rukh rahaa or vahaan bhi tatkaaleen police upmahanireekshak prem prakaash ke viruddh koi thos karrwai nahin hui
 Shrivastava said that now even the Supreme Court has taken cognizance of the Banda rape case, it is hoped that even the powerful officers will not be able to escape from the action
 sapa pravaktaa rajendra choudhary ne kaha ki mayawati sarkaar chote adhikariyon ke viruddh karrwai karke hi vaahvahee lut lenaa chaahati he
 But is unable to show courage to take action against big officials
 choudhary ne kaha, ‘aisa lagata he ki mayawati sarkaar varisht adhikariyon ko sajaa dene kii himmat isliye nahin juta paa rahi he ki ve is sarkaar ke raaj jaanate he or yadi unke viruddh karrwai hui to sarkaar benakaab ho jaayegi
 BJP spokesperson Vijay Bahadur Pathak said that if junior officers are guilty then how can the District Magistrate and District Superintendent of Police escape their responsibility as it is their responsibility to supervise the functioning of small officers
 pathak ne kaha ki banda ke jila police adheekshak ke viruddh karrwai nahin hone se vahaan sthaneey janata main aakrosh batch rahaa he or nishchit rup se is maamle main hui karrwai kii vishwasaneeyata sawaalon ke ghere main he
 He alleged that the District Superintendent of Police went to jail, stayed there and threatened the dalit girl who was locked up for theft to withdraw the charges leveled against the ruling party MLA Purushottam Naresh Dwivedi
 congress pravaktaa ne kaha ki maamle kii sahi tahakikat ke liye jaruri he ki banda ke police adheekshak ko nilambit kiya jaye
 Also because accused MLA Dwivedi is repeatedly threatening to take revenge on his opponents
 aise main unako bachaane main lage jila police adheekshak kaa vahaan rahanaa uchit nahin he
 The investigation report of the CBCID in this case is also silent about the role of the District Superintendent of Police, Das, which casts doubt on the credibility of the investigation
 is sambandh main rajya sarkaar ne ab tak banda ke jailer sahit chah adhikariyon ko nilambit kar diya he

 modi se milane kii khwahishdoosri ore, apnisarkaarake 100 din puure hone par paak pradhanmantri imran ne kaha ki unhen pradhanmantri modi se baat karke khushi hogi
 On the closure of talks between the two countries on behalf of India after the terrorist attack on Pathankot Airforce base, Imran said that the people of Pakistan want peace with India, and they will be happy to meet Modi, as well as any issues Is willing to negotiate
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki pakistan ke logon kii soch badal chuki he or ve shanti chaahate hai
 During a conversation with Indian journalists, Imran said that our land should be used to spread terrorism outside, it is not in the interest of his country
 ham bharat se achche sambandh kii baat karte hai or vyapaar shuru karne kii baat karte hai, kyonki isse garibon ko bhi phayda hoga

 This small country has woken up the superpowers like America and Japan
 america ko is baat kaa dar sata rahaa he ki uttar korea jald hi us par parmaanu hamalaa kar saktaa he
 America's Federal Investigation Agency (CIA) director Mike Pompeo has expressed apprehension about this
 unhone kaha ki uttar korea kuch maheene main america par parmaanu hamalaa kar saktaa he
 The CIA director said that his intelligence agency constantly discusses the threat posed by North Korea and its Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un
 ham uski kuch maheene ke andar america par parmaanu hathiyaaron se hamalaa karne kii kshamta ke bare main charchaa karte hai
 He said that North Korea could acquire the capability to launch a nuclear attack on the US in a few months
 varjeenia sthit CIA mukhyalay main unhone kaha ki hamaara makasad america ke raashtrapati ko khufia jaankaree uplabdh karana he, taaki unke paas gaiyr-rajanyik tareek se in khataron ko kam karne ke vikalp hon
 Pompeo said that taking military action against North Korea could cause heavy loss of life in the region
 is kshetra main america ke ahm sahyogi japan or dakshin korea bhi hai, unke nagarikon ke janajivan ko bhi kaaphi nuksaan ho saktaa he
 In an interview to the BBC, Pompeo said that he was very careful about the outcome of the military action
 unhone kaha ki uttar korea kii satta se kim jong-un ko hataane yaa phir america tak uski parmaanu hamalaa karne kii kshamta ko simit karne ke liye kai raste hai
 In recent times, there was a sharp rhetoric between US President Donald Trump and North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un
 donon hi desh peeche hatane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Despite millions of efforts by the US, North Korea is not taking the name of stopping nuclear and missile testing
 isse pehle CIA ke diarector mike pompeo ne kaha tha kiuttar koriake supreme leader kim jong-un korian prayadweep ko apane adheen karne ke iraade se parmaanu hamalaa kar saktaa he
 North Korea's nuclear missile program is not only for self-defense, but it can use it to attack the Korean Peninsula with the intention of subjugating it

 In this episode, let us see first which seats of the country's largest opposition party Congress, where a slight change in the vote pattern can turn its defeat into victory

 The Congress has 56 seats where the party lost by a narrow margin, but was successful in trailing the third-ranked candidate by more than ten per cent of the votes

 anna hajaare (anna Hazare)ne maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ko chitthee likhakar bataaya he ki wo ahmednagar zile ke apane gaanv ralegan siddhi main anshan par baithne ja rahe hai
 In the letter he has written that it has been 5 years since the Lokpal Act passed but the Modi government did not appoint the Lokpal
 maharashtra main pichley 4 saal se lokayukta act paas nahin hua
 Anti-corruption activist Anna Hazare claimed that the government was making excuses in this case
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki modi sarkaar lokapal or lokayukta kanoon 2013 ko lagu karne ko lekar sanvaidhanik sanghathanon ke nirnyon par dhyaan nahin de rahi he or desh ko ‘taanaashaahee' kii ore le jane kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 Hazare said that in 2011 the whole country stood up to appoint Lokpal and Lokayuktas in the states after which the Lokpal Bill was passed
 unhone kaha, ‘disambar 2013 main kanoon banaaya gaya or modi ne 2014 main sarkaar kaa gathan kiya
 It seemed that Modi will appoint Lokpal and implement Lokpal law and corruption will be curbed in the country
 ' unhone kaha ki vah vah 2014 main satta main aae
 Only it needed to be implemented but five years passed
 kuch yaa anya kaarnon kaa hawala dekar lokapal kii niyukti main deree kii gai
 Hazare told reporters, 'this is all excuses
 'hajaare ne kaha ki unhone pradhanmantri ko 32 patr likhe lekin unhone koi jawaab nahin diya

 Abhishek made 'kay Po Chhe' inspired by Chetan Bhagat's novel and now he has made the film Fitoor inspired by the famous writer Charles Deacon's novel 'the Great Expectations'
 haalanki is nowell ke plat ko kai baar angreji filmon main prayog kiya gaya he, lekin pehali baar is par aadhaarit hindi film banaayi gayi he, kya yah film darshakon ko theatre tak khinch paane main sakasham he? aiyesamikshakarte hai -kahaneeyah kahani kashmir main shuru hoti hai jahaan begum hazrat (tabboo) apane bade bangalo main rahaa karti hai, begum ke saath vishwasghaat hota he jisaki vajah se unka pyaar se vishwaas uth jaataa he, unki beti firdaus(katrina caff)ko bachapan main hi nur (aditya roy kapur) ke rup main ek kaam karne vaala dost mil jaataa he, nur apane didi rukhsar or jija junayd ke saath rahata he, nur ek artist bhi he jise firdaus se bachapan main hi mohabbat ho jaati he, lekin begum ko nur kaa firdaus se milanaa katai bardaasht nahin hota, jisaki vajah se begum, firdaus ko padhai ke liye landan bhej detii hai, nur akelaa pad jaataa he, phir kahani aage badhati he or is lav story ko ek anjaam miltaa he, jise jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 The story of the scriptfilm is based in the Valley of Kashmir, in which the accents and dialogues are served well
 ek taraf apane faisle par adig begum hai to vahin duusari taraf vaadi main panapata pyaar, ek taraf mulk kii aazaadee kaa sawaal he to vahiin ishk par lagane vaali paabandiyaan bhi darshaayi gai hai lekin puri film main screenple or kahani nadaarad he, sab kuch bada hi forcephul sa dikhaai detaa he, film main ajay devgan ko liya to gaya he lekin unhen sahi tarah se prayog main nahin laa paae hai, tabboo kii adaakaari to he lekin jatke se unki kishoravastha kaa kirdaar aditi raav hydari nibhaati hui najar aati hai jo bada hi achambhit karne vaala kissa najar aata he
 It is best to just see the plaintiffs of Kashmir and there is nothing that can attract you
 is kahani main clymex bhi bahut hi dhilaa he
 Tabu has played very well in the role of Begum in the film and did not let any moment seem that she is acting, quite real
 vahiin aditya roy kapur or katrina ne bhi sahaj abhinay kiya he
 The film also stars Aditi Rao Hydari, Lara Dutta Bhupathi, but Child Artist, playing the character of childhood Aditya Roy Kapur, has done very well
 sangitafilm kii sabase acchhee baat iskaa sangeet he
 Amit Trivedi has composed excellent songs, Pashmina, Fitoor, Batiya all make up with the story
 saath hi hitesh sonic ne becoground score bhi maukey kii najaakat se sahi banaaya he
 The weakest link of the film is its reverse-putty script, the story seems unable to fully cache the characters, it could have been made even better, the Kashmir movies are beautiful but the story looks bleak It falls
 kyon dekhechche loketions, aditya roy kapur, katrina caff, tabboo ke abhinay ke diwane hai, yaa amit trivedi kaa sangeet pasand he, to yah film jarur dekhen

 No such person will be found who does not sing favorite songs for himself and his loved ones in the greenery scattered on the mountains
 barish kii vajah se jagah-jagah pahaado se jharne girte aise lagate hai maanon puure maahaul main chaar chand laga rahe hon
 Water flowing from place to place, in many places and everywhere, gives a great relief to the eyes
 or jab chaaron taraf jeevandaayini pani najar aa rahaa ho
 
 
 How is fear there
 lekin
 
 
 
 
 Mountains, waterfalls, rivers, rains, despite all these things, these were the seven days of my life when every moment this water, without water, it seemed poisoned, it was creepy, it seemed like time
 jivan dene vaala pani, jivan leel lene vaala pani ban chukaa tha
 i was also one of the hundreds of reporters who went to cover the disgusting fun that luck and weather had with the lives of thousands of devotees who visited Kedar Baba
 haalanki jab main khand-khand hughae uttarakhand pahunchaa tab is traasadee kaa dasvaan din tha
 By then, the rescue operation was largely over
 hajaaron-lakhon log jaan bachaakar laut rahe the
 There was less outcry in the mountains, but there was an uproar and tension in the ground
 dehradun, haridwar or rishikesh main hajaaron kii taadaad main apano ko dhundte parijan aspataal se lekar bas adde, steshnon or hawaii addon par aise bhaag rahe the, maanon jaraa der hui to jindagi kii res main hameshaa ke liye pichad jaaenge
 For ten-eleven days, when you do not get any news about your parents, sons-daughter, sister-brother or wife-children, then i think you or i would have the same situation
 afratfari faili hui thi
 Everyone wanted to know about their relatives first
 sabar kii tamaam simaayen tut chuki thim
 Now the anger was deepening
 sarkaar se gussa, prashasan se gussa, bhagwaan se gussa, yahaan tak ki media se gussa
 On the very first day, some of the extremists attacked Aaj Tak's cameraman with a fatal attack because the media was not showing the picture of his relatives
 bagaiyr soche-samajhe hue is jaanaleva hamale main mere sahyogi nadeem ke chehre par 6 taanke aaye
 Nadeem or my partner Kumar Abhishek, Pinaki Sen or i did not even realize why and how this happened
 lekin nadeem kaa sarkari aspataal main ilaaj karaate karaate ye baat samaj main aa chuki thi
 Angry mob does not listen to anyone and it does not take any time to provoke a raging mob
 shaayad isi maahaul kaa phayda uthaakar kahin kii khundak mere saathi par nikali
 Such a start on the first day made us nervous, but also encouraged to know why this happened? What was Nadeem's fault? After all, whose anger did he have to suffer? Was this anger or anger against the government? Where is the government after all? Where is the administration Disaster could not be stopped, but how has the government staff failed to apply ointment? With these few questions and thoughts, our caravan started to climb the mountains
 rishikesh se gadhwal ke srinagar pahunchane main jo 4-5 ghante lagate hai wo safar 7 ghante main puraa hua kyonki jaise gaadi upar kii taraf ja rahi thi, raste main tabaahi kii tasviren saaf hoti ja rahi thim
 Roads were broken from place to place
 haadase ke das din baad dhire-dhire ab sena kii madad se jindagi ko patari par laane kii kavayad asaliyat ke dharaatal par dikhne lagi thi
 The Border Road Organization, or BRO personnel, had been uniting day and night in repair of the broken roads from place to place leaving their home and family in this dreadful scene
 aise hi jawan manjit singh ne hamako bataaya ki zamin itani kachi or poli ho chuki he ki 200 meter ke is tukade ko banane main hamen saat din ho rahe hai or teen baar baari barish ke kaaran sari mehnat barabaad bhi ho chuki he
 Don't know when we will be able to complete our work
 itnaa kahkar wo phir apane saathiyon ko ikaitha karke jesibi chalaane main ek baar phir jute jaataa he
 The circumstances were becoming clearer
 pahaado kaa raja uttarakhand taar-taar ho gaya tha
 The foul smell of destruction was also coming from Alaknanda, flowing along
 naa jane kitni jindagiyaan ye jeevandaayini nadi leel chuki thi
 My and my colleague Pinaki had the fear that drinking water from the falling waterfalls was afraid to put his hands in it
 naa jane koun sa ajooba upar se aa gire
 Anyway 
 Life is the name of walking
 ham bhi chale or khub chale
 It was taking two weeks for Prakriti's orgy to be completed
 sena, sarkaar, prashasan kaa sara dhyaan kedarnath samet chaar dhaamon main fanse tamaam logon ko bachaane kaa tha
 Most of the tourists were tourists and some locals who used to visit these places this season due to employment
 lekin sarkaar kii is mehmaannawaazi se khud uttarakhandee ab uktane lage the
 He was upset that why the government is not coming among his own
 rudraprayag, karnaprayag, gochar ke raste to itane zyada prabhavit nahin the
 There was not much damage here either
 lekin jab hamane andruni ilaakon main jane kii koshish kii jaise narayan-baggarh, tharali or deval, chamoli jile ke ye teenon tehsil puri tarah se mukhya maarg se cat chuke the
 To reach them, we tracked the hill at 5 places and we had neither experience nor preparation to track on the raw paths and slippery paths
 lekin jab sthaneey logon khaskar auraton ko 20 kilo ke anaaj or rashan kii boriyaan kandhon par laade dekha to naa sirf hausala aayaa, balki himmat bhi ai ki ham bhi chal sakate hai
 While talking to a 14-year-old boy named Bipin, while we were climbing the mountain at the place named Harmony, the child told that the food in the house is over
 pitaaji kaa koi pataa nahin he, maa or chote bhai-bahan behad pareshaan or bhukhe hai to apane masterji kaa ghar jo ki yahaan se 8 kilometre dur se vahaan se ye kuch khaane pine kaa saaman lekar laut rahaa hum
 There was no emotion in Bipin's stony eyes
 wo sirf teji se chalanaa chaah rahaa tha
 Hearing his words, my heart was coming to my mouth, but i felt that it is not right to show sympathy with Vipin at this time and to shake her from her floor
 or main chup rahaa or bipin teji se aage nikal gaya
 No such stories were found
 harek shaks ke paas apni pareshaani, apana kissa, apana anubhav
 Our courage in reaching Dewal via Tharali started answering
 lekin ek baat puure raste samaan rahi thi wo ye ki hamaari sarkaar hamaare paas nahin aa rahi
 Even the CM or the minister is away, no one comes to take care of us
 kuch ugr samajasevakon ne to hamako yahaan tak kaha ki kyonki hamaare ilaakon main kisi kii maut nahin hui to prashasan hamaari sud nahin le rahaa
 If instead of hundreds of houses and shops in areas like Narayanbagad and Tharali, 10-20 people would have died, the government staff would have come to us immediately after the accident
 ye log ab adolnon kii dhamkee de rahe the
 Their pain even came to an end that when the camera till today can come here through all the rough paths, why not DM and CM
 vahiin sarkari skulon main raahat shivi main jo log apana sara ghar-baar ganvaakar rah rahe hai unke saamne alag musivat he
 There is no roof left over the head nor land to keep the feet
 khet, makaan or dukaan pinder nadi ke prakope main samaa chuke hai
 After hundreds of years, the Pinder River also changed its course to the exact place where the largest population lived around it
 majaburi main raja or rank ek hi kaksha main dari par sone ko majaboor the
 All the people living here like Pradhan, Ashok Uncle, Pramila Devi were now fearing that when the schools are opened, they will be deprived even of the temporary roof which has been found
 or agar skool naa khule to unke bacchon ke bhavishya kaa kya hoga
 That is to say where to go
 ye sab ghatnaayen kachotati hai ki aakhir kyon
 What caused nature to get angry with these innocent people? lekin ek man ye bhi kahata he ki ham khud hi doshi hai
 We only need a river view room
 pahaado par chhuttiyaan manaane janaa jaisaa kii aavashyak ho gaya he
 Have to go to the mountains twice, if not four, in a year
 nadi ke kinare mandali markar baithna, vahiin khaanaa-pinaa, gandagi chhod dena
 And not only we, but thousands of people like us are doing this every day
 to jab ham kudarat par sitam dhaayenge to kudarat kii maar to sunai bhi nahin detii
 Government conditions, government corruption and our unscrupulous intentions made these conditions worse
 jahaan tahaan betaratib se cranstruction, jameenon par avaidh kabja
 And then exploit and exploit nature in every way so that one's own pockets are full of chaos
 aise main sarkaron ko agar kosa jaataa he to wo koi galat nahin he
 But now is the time for us to look into our own lives
 or kuch karen naa karen lekin kudarat kaa sammaan karnaa agar shuru kar den to shaayad halaat ko sambhala ja saktaa he
 After all these assessments, we returned from Uttarakhand but in 8 days it was not difficult to understand that it would take 5 to 7 years to settle this fragmented state economically and socially, only then this state would be on the path of progress

 The letter was signed by Shiv Sena leader Eknath Shinde, NCP state chief Jayant Patil and Congress Maharashtra unit chief Balasaheb Thorat
 shellar ne mumbai main samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ''yah ek farji patr he kyonki takneekee rup se ajit pavaar abhi bhi ensipi ke vidhayak dal ke netaa hai or unhone bijepi ko samarthan diya he
 He said, "the NCP has still not suspended Ajit Pawar from the party's legislature party leader and membership of the party
" isliye, ajit pavaar abhi bhi vidhansabha main ensipi ke netaa hai
 Shelar said that the NCP has given the powers of Ajit Pawar to Jayant Patil, but the party has not yet elected the post of leader in the assembly
 bijepi vidhayak ne kaha, ''unki shaktiyon ko abhi tak rajya ke rajyapal dwaara maanya nahin kiya gaya he
 Also, the Congress has not elected the Leader of the House, so the signing of Balasaheb Thorat as the State President makes no sense
 ''gauratlab he ki maharashtra ke apratyaashit raajnneetik ghatnakram main rajyapal ne shanivaar kii subah bijepi netaa devendra fadanvis ko mukhyamantri or ensipi netaa ajit pavaar ko up mukhyamantri pad kii shapath dilaai

 srisanth agle saal cricket main vaapasi karenge
 The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Ombudsman DK Jain has ordered that the ban on Sreesanth, the tainted fast bowler in the alleged spot-fixing case, will end on 13 September 2020 and he will be eligible to play all types of cricket
 lekin unki 'vaapasi' kisi hogi yah charchaa kaa vishay he
 Sreesanth has already lost his best phase due to a ban of 6 years

 He has one last chance to revive his cricketing career
 haalanki yah dekhnaa hoga ki kya vah apni gharelu team kerala kaa pratinidhitiv kar paaenge
 
 ? agar cricket main unki vaapasi ho bhi jaati he, vah unke liye badi khushi dene vaali nahin ho sakati

 In Bigg Boss 12, a contestant was out on Weekend War on Sunday
 neha pendse ko ghar se janaa padaa
 Karanvir Bohra is safe
 bataaya gaya tha ki neha pendse ko isliye baahar kiya gaya, kyonki ve parform nahin kar paa rahi thim
 The reasoning behind this is that the producers were paying them 20 lakh rupees every week, despite this, they were not able to perform anything special
 yahi kaaran he ki nirmaataaon ne unhen is hafte baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya

 ) The efforts of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis in Maharashtra seem to be paying off
 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi - shivasena ek baar phir saath aate dikh rahe hai
 If sources are to be believed, on the lines of Bihar, BJP has agreed to bow before Shiv Sena in Maharashtra
 dono main 24-24 siton par baat banati dikh rahi he
 It is a different matter that Shiv Sena is still refusing any such proposal
 matoshri main shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare se maargdarshan le baahar nikle saansadon main se ek sajany raaoot ne abhi tak kisi prastaav se inkaar kiya lekin hameshaa kii tarah akele ladane kii baat nahin doharaai
 Sanjay Raut said that there was no discussion on the utility
 koi prastaav bhi nahin aayaa he
 Uddhav ji has said that we are fully ready to fight
 maharashtra main ham bade bhai hai or is naate ham desh kii or rajya kii raajnneeti karenge
 It was a coincidence that the BJP had a meeting of the state executive in Jalna on the same day, and Shiv Sena mps in Mumbai

 BJP whose seat is more its chief minister, while Shiv Sena wants its own chief minister
 sanjay raaoot bhale abhi koi pushti nahi karen par charchaa to yahaan tak he ki rajya kii 48 loksabhaa siton par donon hi partiyaan barabari par matlab 24-24 siton par ladane ko taiyaar ho gai hai
