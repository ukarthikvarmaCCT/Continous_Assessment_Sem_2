 Kailash Mansarovar is not far away, as devotees have got the gift of new and easy way to reach Bhole's Dham
 is nae raste se 18 june se yatra shuru hogi
 India had been demanding this for years and finally this dream of Shiva devotees was fulfilled
 bhole bhandari ke bhakton ke liye nayaa dwaar khulaa he
 The footpaths of faith, which had been in demand for the past 60 years, were constantly being negotiated with China, the worship of the devotees of Shiva is now complete
 china ke saath bharat kaa yah samjhauta bada hai, kyonki bhagwaan ke ghar tak pahunchane kaa rasta aasaan hua he
 While the agreement was signed in September last year on Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi formally announced the commencement of the Mansarovar Yatra on June 18, the second day of his three-day visit to China
 22 hajaar 28 feet kii oonchai, har saal hajaaron shivbhakton kaa rela, shiv ke dham kii is yatra ke liye bhole bhandari ke pujari durgam pahadiyon or durgam raaston se hokar yatra karte aae hai
 After the agreement of China on the new path, the difficulties of the Shiva devotees will be eased along the easy path
 is maarg ke khulne se sabase zyada phayda bujurgon ko hoga
 Now they will be able to avoid the hassle of walking
 nae raste se kailash maansarovar yatra 1 maheene ke bajaay 1 hafte main puri hogi
 Kailash Mansarovar is considered the abode of shiva-shambhu
 shivdham ke darshan ke liye har saal hajaaron sadhu-sant, shraddhalu, darshanik kai dinon kii durgam yatra ko tay kar kailash pahunchate hai
 Millions of people of the country have received the gift of a new road in addition to the old road of Uttarakhand
 lakhon log ab puraane raste ke 150 kilometre ke hisse kii takalif or pareshaani se batch sakenge
 This is the part where devotees have to cross the tedious ascent on foot
 nae raste kii badaulat ab yatri apni gaadi se hi kailash maansarovar tak pahunch sakenge
 During Modi's visit to China, the new gift to the devotees going to Mansarovar got the final seal
 is saal june se shuru hone vaali yatra main bhakt nae raste kaa istemaal kar paaenge
 The Nathula Pass of Sikkim along the Indian border will be used for this journey
 dharchula se lipulekh darre ke paramparaagat root kaa istemaal log saalon se karte aae hai
 But after the sino-indian War of 1962, China prohibited the visit of Kailash Mansarovar
 lekin 1981 main kuch sharton ke saath yah root phir se kholaa gaya
 Since then, the journey has continued through this traditional route
 lekin bharat sarkaar china se ek or rasta kholane kii maang karti rahi thi
 There is always a danger of life and property on the way to China via Uttarakhand
 yatriyon ko kareeb-kareeb 150 kilometre tak paidal kachche raste par chalanaa padataa tha
 Now there is relief from people getting the new route
 kailash maansarovar tak pahunchane kii raah jitani mushkil he, bhakton kii aasthaa or vishwaas utana hi atoot
 The longing to see Lord Shiva brings him to Kailash Mansarovar
 yahaan darshan kar bhakt samast paap karmon se mukti pate hai

 saal 2018 main shridevi or boni kapur kii badi beti jahanvi kapur film dhadak ke saath apana bollywood debyue karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 On this, there is a question in the hearts of people whether Jahnavi Kapoor will prove to be a great actress like her mother Sridevi
 haal hi main ek intervyuu main is sawaal kaa jawaab boni kapur ne diya
 He said that Jahnavi Kapoor has a personality of his own
 wo kabhi bhi filmon main apni maa ko copy karne kii koshish nahin karegi
 i sincerely hope that when people see her on screen, they will not say that Jahnavi is acting like her mother
 jahanvi apni pehali film se hi logon ko yah jataa degi ki wo shridevi kii beti se alag hatakar bhi kuch he
 Sridevi's lip surgery made her face worse, now she looks like Aseboni Kapoor, saying that if Jahnavi has to make a special place among the audience, then she will have to win everyone's heart by showing her unique style
 wo kaaphi mehnatee he or usamen apni samaj bhi he
 i sincerely hope that she does not disappoint people
 reel premi ishan khatter ke saath kahaan dinar karne pahunchi jahnavi kapoorjab boni kapur se poocha gaya ki jahanvi kii pehali film kii shooting kisi chal rahi he to unhone bataaya, ‘jab dhadak kii shooting shuru hui thi to main kuch dinon ke liye udaipur main tha
 The shooting of the film is going very well and Jahnavi is also doing a good job
 jab main vahaan tha to film kaa ek gaanaa shoot kiya ja rahaa tha, jisamen jahanvi kaaphi acchhee dikh rahi thi
 Let us tell you that Ishaan and Jahnavi are shooting for the film Dhadak
 'dhadak' marathi film 'sarat' kaa hindi rimek he
 It is also Jahnavi's debut film
 khabaren hai ki 'dhadak' main shridevi, jahnavi kii maa ke role main najar aa sakati hai 'I believe that there should be transparency in the thinking of the government as well as the media
 news chhapati he ki nahin loktantr main sirf yahi ek chiz nahin he
 'this is the promise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 us pradhanmantri kaa jo media main news kii tarah dikhne or chhapane ke liye dedh dedh ghante kaa ricarded intervyuu dete hai
 Whose government has given thousands of crores of rupees to the public to advertise in the media
 wo pradhanmantri kah rahe hai ki news kaa chapana loktantr main sirf yahi ek chiz nahin he
 This thinking about the news of the Prime Minister of the world's largest democracy is frightening
 pradhanmantri ne yah baat indian express ke raveesh tiwari or rajmakal jha se kahi he
 This interview was published on 12 May
 is intervyuu main pradhanmantri indian express ko kai baar patrakarita ko lekar lacture dete hai
 Express journalists do not question the counter
 aisa lagata he ki unhone sunaane ke liye express ko bulaayaa he
 They do not tell which news of the express was wrong but do not forget to tell which news he did not
 kisi pradhanmantri kaa yah kahana he ki news kaa chapana hi loktantr main ek maatr kaam nahin he, daraavna he
 You should be afraid how dark the public will be then
 kisi bhi loktantr main sarkaar kaa moolyankan aap tabhi kar sakate hai jab media swatantra ho
 If the media is not independent, based on what information you will be able to evaluate the government
 aise main jab pradhanmantri hi kah den ki news kaa chapana ekmaatr kaam nahin he
 If you support the Prime Minister for this, then you must have dreamed of the annihilation of democracy properly
 meri raay main pradhanmantri ne yah baat kah kar samvidhan kii jis bhaavana par bharat kaa loktantr khadaa he, uskaa apmaan kiya he
 You cannot be a citizen in a democracy without information and questions
 ho kar dikhaa dijie
 It will be feared that the express did not give this line a place in the headline
 varna express jaisaa akhbaar is baat se nahin chukta
 Media is being suppressed worldwide
 bharat main to khatm hi kar diya gaya
 The Indian Express has one to one photographers
 kamaal he is intervyuu main file photo lagaaya gaya he
 Why did the Prime Minister, who is conscious of his photographs, abstain from the photographer
 pradhanmantri ne jis khan market ko gang ke rup main chinhit kiya he, unhen pataa nahin ki unke hi kai mantri, party ke netaa vahaan tahaltey khate nazar aate hai
 The journalists of the dock media go there to drink coffee
 vahaan shoping karne jate hai
 The Prime Minister sees his anti-gang
 award vaapasi gang, tukade-tukade gang or khan market gang
 The prime minister is worshiped in 90 percent of the media space
 iske baad bhi ve kisi gang kii kalpana khadaa kar khud ko bechaara dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 As the world is behind them
 kisaan se lekar berojgaar tak unase sawaal kar rahe hai
 Are these people also members of Khan Market Gang? Is Prime Minister Khan making a shipwreck statement escaping the radar from the clouds under the influence of Market Gang? Every government creates an elite circle of power system around itself
 modi ne agar puraane ghere ko todaa he to nayaa gheraa bhi banaaya he
 Their gang does not live in Khan Market, but the character of the gang from media to Bollywood is not different from the gang that allegedly lives in Khan Market
 pradhanmantri ke liye godi media kya gang kii tarah kaam nahin kar rahaa he? news ko lekar pradhanmantri kii bhashaa kya gang ke sardaar kii bhashaa nahin lagati he?indian express ke baad news nesan ko diya gaya unka intervyuu dekhie
 Deepak Chaurasia urges him to recite the poem
 modi apni mez kii taraf ishaara karte hai ki file padi hogi yahaan, aaj hi ek kavita likhi he
 After that the next shot shows that the file is in his lap
 us jagah par shot rokkar dekhne se pataa chalata he ki kaagaz par kavita vaala sawaal likhaa hua he
 Which is asked by Deepak Chaurasia
 janata or bijepi ke samarthak ek sawaal khud se puuchhen
 The Prime Minister is giving interviews or giving away the bluff? Would you like to see an interview in which questions are decided beforehand? There have been such questions about the Prime Minister's interview already
 lekin jhooth jab bad jaataa he to satya jhaankne chalaa aata he
 Right after 5 years, but now it has been confirmed that the Prime Minister does not give a live interview, asks for questions before giving an interview and gets an edit after answering
 kya edit kiya hua intervyuu channel par dikhaane se pehle pradhanmantri kii team se paas bhi karaayaa gaya tha?jis pradhanmantri modi kii dilli kii raajnneeti main shuruuaat is baat se hui thi ki ve khulkar intervyuu dete hai
 Read without writing
 isi baat ko lekar to madhyamvarg manmohan singh kaa mazaaq udaata tha
 Used to say that the Prime Minister should be speaking
 vahi pradhanmantri ab reliyon main telepramter se bol rahe hai
 Answering pre-determined questions
 pradhanmantri se batua rakhane vaala sawaal fakiri vaale sawaal jitna aitihaasik he
 The Prime Minister is a master at making a story
 unhen pataa he ki janata ko acchhee shiksha nahin mili he
 Sell him any story, the public will believe it
 dilli main kathith rup se khan market gang bhale is baat kii aalochana kar le ki badal hone se jahaaz ko radar nahin pakadega, yah baat bakawaas he or ise pradhanmantri ko nahin kehani chahie kyonki duniya hansegi
 But it may be that the public will feel that, oh my mind, how much our Prime Minister has in mind
 jis vayusena ko aaj tak itani si baat samaj nahin ai, agar modi ji nahin rahenge to air force vaale ladaaku vimaan ko bail se khinchne lagenge
 They may not even know how to fly
 'maine pehali baar 87-88 main digital camera kaa upyog kiya tha
 At that time very few people did not have email
 mere yahaan adwani ji kii sabha thi
 i took a photo of Advani on a digital camera
 tab digital camera itnaa bada aata tha, mere paas tha
 i transmitted to Delhi
 adwani ji ko sarprize hua ki dilli main meri tasviir aaj ke aaj kaise chhapi
 'internet service in India started on 15 August 1995
 modi ji kah rahe hai ki 87-88 main email se tasviir dilli bhej di
 Was Modi invented email too? kis akhbaar ko email kiya tha?yah dukhad he
 The public and supporters have lovingly voted for the Prime Minister
 pradhanmantri modi ko unki budhimatta kaa apmaan nahin karnaa chahie
 The Prime Minister is also making fun of his supporters living in the country and abroad
 unke bahut se samarthak is baat par seenaa taane ghoomte hai ki ve ek padhe-likhe yogya vyakti kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 At least they are not Pappu

 sutron ke mutabik, centre sarkaar ne saaf kar diya he ki espiji suraksha paae log jab bhi videsh yatra karenge, tab unke saath espiji surakshakarmi maujuud rahenge
 According to sources, if the SPG security personnel do not take the SPG with them during their foreign trip, then their trip can also be canceled
 maujuuda samay main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke alaava congress kii antarim adhyaksh sonia gandhi, rahul gandhi or priyanka gandhi wadra ko espiji suraksha mili hui he
 It is believed that this change has been made by the Center after the news of former Congress President Rahul Gandhi's visit to Columbia in recent times
 suraksha ko lekar nae nirdeshcendre kii ore se die gaye nae disha-nirdesh main special protection group (espiji) kii suraksha paane vaale ke liye sarkari disha-nirdeshon kaa paalan karnaa anivaary hoga
 The spg's security personnel are always present with this special security guard
 mana ja rahaa he ki is disha-nirdesh ko nahin maane jane kii surat main suraksha ke lihaaj se unki videsh yatra bhi radd kar di jaaegi
 Recently, Rahul Gandhi went with the SPG to his first place abroad while traveling abroad, but he sent the security personnel back as a personal visit
 agar ve apni pasand ke anuroop ghoomane jate hai to yah unke khud ke liye behad khatarnaak hota jayega
 The Maharashtra government has been very strict in the matter of procurement of crops and has made it a rule that if caught by a buyer at a price below the Minimum Support Price (MSP), he will face a jail term of one year
 gauratlab he ki kharif sijan kii fasal aane main bas ek maheenaa hi bachaa he
 Therefore, the Maharashtra government has said that no person will buy produce less than the fixed MSSP, even if he is a businessman
 agar koi aisa karata pakadaa gaya to use ek saal kii jail kii sajaa ho sakati he or 50,000 rupee jurmaana bhi dena pad saktaa he
 According to the Indian Express, after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, the state government approved the amendment to the Maharashtra Agricultural Produce Marketing Act
 isse hoga yah ki ab aise kisi 'bazaar kshetra' kaa alag se koi nirdhaaran nahin hoga jahaan jinson kii kharid-bikri kii jaati ho
 Instead, the entire state will be considered as a market and traders will not have to get a separate license for trading in any APMC market
 yani isse vyapaariyon ke liye bhi ek tarah kii sahuuliyat he
 They will be able to buy from any mandi in Maharashtra
 isse kisaanon ko bhi behatar keemat mil sakegi
 Until now, traders were often able to buy farmers' crops at prices lower than the MSP citing market downturn or other reasons
 sarkaar kii nai emspi niti ko lagu karne kii jimmedaari ab sirf sarkari kharid agenciyon kii hi nahin, balki nijee vyapaariyon kii bhi hogi
 Farmers can benefit greatly from this
 udhaaharan ke liye philhal maharashtra ke akola, latur or amravati jaise bazaaron main tuur daal 3,600 se 3,700 rupee prati quintal bik rahi he
 This is much less than the MSP fixed by the central government at Rs 5,675
 pichley saal peak sijan ke dauraan tilhan 2,600 se 2,700 rupee prati quintal bik rahaa tha, jabaki uske liye emspi 3,050 rupee tay kiya gaya tha
 Pakistan, which is on the verge of bankruptcy, has conducted another test in the arms race with India
 air strike ke baad se baukhalaaye pakistan ne aaj daawa kiya he ki jeef 17 thunder ladaaku vimaan se usne swadeshi taur par viksit vistaarit range vaale ek ‘smart hathiyaar’ kaa safal pareekshan kiya he
 Pakistan claims that with this test, fighter aircraft will now be able to hit the target day and night with utmost accuracy
 pakistan vayusena (pieef) ne yah bhi kaha ki yah prayog desh ke liye mile kaa pathar he kyonki hathiyaar kaa vikaas pakistani vaigyanikon or ejiniyaron dwaara swadeshi prayaason se kiya gaya he
 The JF 17 Thunder aircraft is designed with the help of China
 pieef ne daawa kiya he ki safal prayog se jeef 17 thunder ko din or raat main behad sateekta ke saath vibhinn prakaar ke lakshyon ko saadhane kii kshamta hasil ho gai he
 Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Mujahid Anwar Khan, while calling himself a peace-loving country, also gave a teary note that we will respond with full force in the event of an enemy attack
 pakistan ne ye pareekshan aise vakt main kiya he, jab donon deshon ke sambandh pichley do dashakon main sabase kharaab hue hai
 After the Pulwama attack, India's brave pilots entered the Pakistan den and carried out an air strike on the terrorists
 raat teen se chaar baje ke bich kii gai is air strike main pakistani vimaanon ko is strike kii hawa tak nahin lag pai thi
 Jamban pilots of the Indian Air Force transported the Jaish gangster Masood Azhar's terrorists to their end in Balakot, Pakistan from the mig-21
 bharat ke air strike ke bare main pakistan ne sapane main bhi nahin sochaa hoga
 At that time, Pakistan was very bad in the whole world, it was difficult even for Pakistan to respond to its people
 isaki baangi tab dikhi jab hamale ke baad din main pakistan ke rakshaamantri or videsh mantri press ke saamne aae
 On questions from journalists, Pakistan Defense Minister Pervez Khattar said that our air force could not take action because of the darkness
 hamaari vayusena bhi taiyaar thi
 If such action is taken then we will reply
 unke is bayaan kaa jamkar majaak uda tha

 lekin bihar ke mujffarpur main ek duulhe ko apni shariq-e-hayaat se zyada dahej ke saamaan kaa laalach tha
 He not only paid the price for it, but also had to get married in court four days before the due date
 kya tha maamla?mujffarpur ke dhanoti gaanv kii chanchala kumaar kii shaadi sahibganj ke parsauni-rais gaanv ke pawan ke saath tay hui thi
 Though the name of the village is associated with the rich, Pawan's heart was poor in the case of the bride
 24 april ko tilak kii rasm ke dauraan ladakiwaalon ne dahej main kaaphi saamaan diya
 Out of the amount of 1 lakh fixed earlier, he also paid 70 thousand
 lekin shukriya adaa karne ke bajaae pawan apane hone vaale sasuraal pahunch gaya
 He not only described the goods as bad, but also demanded the outstanding cash amount
 sasuraal main ai shamtalekin ye sasuraal kuch alag tha
 Instead of pleading with the girl's family, the groom took the groom hostage
 shaadi se mahaj chaar din pehle is bavaal par duulhe ke gharavaale bhi kaise chup baithte? jhagada badhate-badhate panchayat tak pahunchaa
 In front of the punches, the girl's family expressed suspicion that Pawan may also refuse to marry
 lihaaja panchayat ne use 26 april ko hi court main shaadi kaa aadesh diya
 The two families have become reconciled after wearing the varmala
 ladki kii maa mita devi ne panchayat ke faisle par khushi jataai
 At the same time, according to Pawan's uncle Kumod Rai, he considers Chanchala as daughter-in-law and he will have full respect in his house

 During Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Myanmar, India has made it clear that it will not become a refuge for Rohingya Muslims illegally infiltrated from Myanmar
 kendriya rajyamantri kiran rigiju ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki rohingya avaidh apravasi hai or unako unke mulk bheja jayega
 He said that no one should preach to India on this issue, because India has sheltered the maximum number of refugees in the world
 rigiju ne kaha, "main antarrashtriya sanghathanon se kahana chahta hum ki chaherohingyasamyukt raashtra maanavadhikaar ayog ke tahat panjikrut hai yaa nahin, ve bharat main avaidh apravasi hai
 "the Minister of State for Home said," Since they are not legitimate immigrants, they have to be sent to their country
 kanoon ke anusaar unhen desh se nikaala janaa he, kyonki ve avaidh apravasi hai
 We are a country with great democratic traditions
 bharat ne duniya main adhiktam sankhya main sharnaarthiyon ko jagah di he, isliye kisi ko bhi sharnaarthiyon se kaise bartaav kiya jaae is par bharat ko naseehat nahin deni chaiye
 Taking a tough stance on the criticism of the government's stand on the issue, Rijiju said, "we are following the legal path, then why are we being accused of being inhumane
" "rigiju ne kaha ki centre ne sabhi rajya sarkaron corohingya logonko desh se nikaalane kii prakriya shuru karne kaa nirdesh diya he

 Assam Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that the National Register of Citizens (NRC) cannot be seen as a "red letter" to Assamese society
 bijepi netaa ne sanket die ki unhen is baat par thodaa bharosa tha ki yah list videshiyon se chhutkaaraa paane main madad karegaa
 "after the drafts have come, we have lost hope in view of the present scenario of NRC," Sarma told local journalists on Friday
 jab kai sachche bhartiya isse baahar chale gaye, tab aap kaise is baat kaa daawa kar sakate hai ki yah document asamiya samaaj ke liye red letters he
 "in districts bordering Bangladesh like South Salamra and Dhubri, the evacuation rate is the lowest and in Bhoomiputra district, it is higher," he said
 yah kaise ho saktaa he? hamen ab is enarasi main koi dilchaspee nahin he
 "himanta Biswa Sarma said," NRC is not a quarterfinal, semi-final and final to take out Bangladeshis
 thodi der pratiksha karen or aap bhaajapa shashan ke tahat adhik final dekhenge
 "let us know that the final list of citizens in Assam will be published online today at 10 am
" is list ke saamne aane ke baad ye saaf ho jayega ki pichley saal list ke draft se baahar hue 41 lakh logon main se kitne antim list main jagah bana pate hai
 Those who will be named in the list will be considered as citizens of the country and those who will not be named will be considered as foreigners
 list ke prakaashan se pehle assam police ne pradesh main afawaah failaane waalon ko rokane ke liye qamar kas lee he
 In view of security, Section 144 has also been imposed in many areas of the state
 jin logon ke naam antim suchi main nahin honge unki suraksha kii bhi vyavastha kii gai he
 Before the publication of the final list of NRC, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal told people not to panic, the state government would take all possible steps to help those who are truly Indians to prove their citizenship
 sonoval ne in logon ko kanoonee sahaayta muhaiyaa karaane kaa bhi aashwaasan diya
 He also said that if someone's name is left out of the final list of NRC to be published on Saturday, it does not mean that he has become a foreigner
 kyonki uchit kanoonee prakriya ke baad videshi nyaayaadhikaran (apat) hi is sambandh main nirnay le saktaa he
 He said, 'no one needs to worry
 kisi ko ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin he
 The government will take care of everyone
 antim suchi se jinka naam baahar rakhaa jayega, unhen bhi apni naagarikta sabit karne kaa puraa avasar milegaa
 Prateek Hajela, Assam State Coordinator of NRC, faced criticism from the ruling BJP on Monday

 Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh said on Wednesday that the budget will be dedicated to the farmers of the country, as the government has targeted to double the income of farmers by 2022

 "he said that the decisions taken by the government for the purpose of promoting investment in the agriculture sector have changed the sector and the upcoming budget will be dedicated to the farmers
 unhone kaha ki purv kii sarkaar ne 2009-2014 ke daura krishi mantralay kaa bajtiy aavant 1
 21 lakh crore, while Modi increased it to 2 during 2014-19
 11 lakh karod rupee kar diya
 Earlier also, sources said that in this budget, the Modi government can provide considerable relief to the common man, that is, the middle class
 bataaya ja rahaa tha ki chunavi bajet hone ke alaava is faisle main is sachai kaa bhi dakhal he ki kuch hi vakt pehle BJP teen ahm rajyon main congress ke haathon satta ganvaa chuki he, or ab unke paas madhyam varg ko saadhane ke alaava zyaada vikalp shesh nahin hai
 For this purpose, a few days ago in Afratfari, the Central Government also passed a bill to provide 10% reservation in the field of government jobs and education to the economically weaker people of upper castes

 centre kii modi sarkaar ne desh main har ghar tak bijli pahunchane ke liye march 2019 kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 However, the Modi government's exercise in the field of power generation and distribution is not complete here
 is lakshya ko paane ke saath-saath ab modi sarkaar padosi desh bangladesh main bhi 2022 tak prayek ghar ko bijli pahunchane kii yojana par kaam kar rahi he
 The Modi government, under its 'neighborhood First' policy, has taken a step towards meeting the energy needs of Bangladesh by taking the initiative to center the energy business with neighboring countries
 is niti ke tahat donon desh maujuuda samay main 660 megawatt bijli kaa kaarobaar kar rahe hai
 During the visit of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to India in 2017, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed to provide 500 MW additional power
 modi sarkaar kii padosi deshon ko raushan kar dwipaksheeya rishton ko majboot karne kii is kavayad main sarkari companiyon ke alaava nijee kshetra kii companiyaan bhi kaam kar rahi hai
 Adani Power has also proposed to supply Bangladesh cobbles from its coal based plant in Jharkhand
 vahiin gujarat or rajasthan main sarkari or nijee kshetra kii bhagidaari main taiyaar ho rahe solar parkon se bhi bangladesh ko lagbhag 2000 megawatt bijli supplai karne kii yojana par kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 Significantly, the Sheikh Hasina government of Bangladesh has set a target of providing electricity to every household by 2022
 iske liye beete kuch varshon se bangladesh ne urja paidaa karne kii kai koshish kii lekin zyaadaatar prayaason main use ummid mutabik safalataa haath nahin lagi
 The ruling Awami League in Bangladesh, through its manifesto in the 2014 general elections, promised that by 2022, it would work to provide electricity to every household across the country
 haalanki sarkaar banane ke baad se lekar abhi tak is project par lage bangladesh ke power ministar daawa karte hai ki vah is lakshya ko saal ke ant main hone vaale chunaavon se pehle puraa kar lenge
 It is worth noting that the progress of this project in Bangladesh under the World Bank project has been seen after the initiative of the Government of India to illuminate the neighboring countries under the Neighborhood Policy
 bharat ke is pahal ke chalate hi bangladesh sarkaar ko ummid he ki vah apane lakshya bharat ke bharose aadhe samay main hi puraa kar legaa
 The biggest problem facing the Bangladesh government in meeting its target is the high cost of electricity generated there
 vahiin pichley kuch varshon se bharat main utpaadit bijli kii keemat lagaataar kam ho rahi he
 Due to this, the Government of Bangladesh is now receiving efforts by the Modi government to strengthen bilateral relations through energy business
 urja kshetra ke jaankaron kaa daawa he ki bangladesh sarkaar ne bharat ke saath urja kaarobaar ke majboot hote rishte ke aadhaar par daawa karnaa shuru kar diya he ki vah 2022 tak apane lakshya ko puraa kar legi
 According to Bangladesh government data, the Awami League government was formed in the country in 2009 under the leadership of Sheikh Hasina
 is vakt tak bangladesh main mahaj 47 fisadi upabhoktaaon ko bijli mil rahi thi
 But during the tenure of Shek Hasina government, at present, less than 90 percent population has been completed
 gauratlab he ki modi sarkaar ne bharat menmarch 2019 takadesh main har ghar tak bijli supplai kaa lakshya rakhaa he, aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon ke chalate uski koshish is vaade ko puraa kar janata ke saamne jane kii he
 Now, by strengthening the energy business with Bangladesh, the Modi government is looking to achieve the goal of achieving the goal by March 2019

 Ajay Maken, head of the Congress's communications department, said that the 2002 riots had lost thousands of lives and that the comparisons used by Narendra Modi in this background are condemnable

 They should be sad

 a friend sent a video to whatsapp one day
 adatan maine nahin dekha
 After some time the friend called and asked how the video looked, then i promised that i will definitely watch
 jab maine video dekha to hairaan rah gaya
 a blind man was doing cricket commentary, that too in the style of radio
 ghar jate-jate jab radio par khud cricket camentry sun rahaa tha, to wo video baar-baar zahan main aa rahaa tha
 The only question was that the person who had never seen cricket, how can he comment on cricket, that too in English
 sochaa world cap ke bukhaar main story logon ko pasand aegi
 After some research, it was found that the name of this unique cricket fan is Karamveer Sehrawat, who lives in Karala village in Delhi
 karamvir ek blind releef skool main nau saal se rah rahaa tha, lekin mujhe to ye jaananaa tha ki angrezi main cricket camentry kaise sikhi? Talked to Karamveer for a while, then the power of radio and cricket was realized
 pichley 25 saalon se karamvir cricket maichon ko radio par sunate rahe hai
 He liked English commentators very much and he used to imitate them
 agar koi use match kaa haal poochta, to wo angreji style main camentry karke use puure match kaa haal bataata
 When he started commentary in front of me, my cameraman was shocked
 use yakeen hi nahin hua ki aisa kuch ho saktaa he
 It was just to capture this sentiment on camera and tell the story of Karamveer to the people
 "shauk or lagan ho to kamazoriyaan hunar ban jaati hai"
 
 
 Karamveer Sehrawat is a great example of this saying
 bachapan main unki ankhon kii roshni chali gai, magar cricket ke pyaar ne jivan ko niraash nahin hone diya
 Karamvir Sehrawat has a passion like crores of cricket lovers of India and he is also different from them
 cricket kii beintahaa chahat kii vajah se karmveer ne radio par camentry sunanaa apana pehla shauk bana daalaa
 The day the match took place, the entire day would be spent on the radio
 dilli aakar nae doston ne unke is hunar ko saraah kar isamen unhen nayaa rang bharne kaa mauqaa diya
 Karamveer continued to enjoy cricket matches with colleagues
 kabhi shauk, kabhi sharaarat ke sahare karmveer khud ko maanjte rahe
 They are also very mischievous, sometimes they deliberately surprised people by intentionally commenting while walking in a bus
 apane jivan ko alag-alag awaazon ke aadhaar par chalaane vaale karmveer kii awaz hi unki pahchaan banati ja rahi he, log lanbaa safar kar unhen sunne or unase milane unke paas aane lage hai
 They cannot comment LIVE, because they cannot watch matches
 lekin unhen agar match kaa haal sunaanaa ho, to wo kisi se kam nahin
 One of the richest sports in the world, this unique fan of cricket may be living in fakery, but the number of his fans is increasing everyday

 The effect of this violence has started appearing on TV channels as well
 karnataka main kai jagah tamil bhashaa ke channelon par roak laga di gai he to tamilnadu ke kai shaharon main kannada bhashaa ke channelon par roak laga di gai he
 On one hand, this uproar was going on in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, there was a special hearing on the petition of Karnataka in the Supreme Court in Delhi on the day of Eid

 The Supreme Court then made some changes to its September 5 order
 paanch sitambar ko supreme court ne kaha tha ki karnataka agle das din tak tamilnadu ke liye har rose kaveri nadi kaa 15 hazaar kusek pani jari kare
 But today the Supreme Court reduced the amount of water and extended the days
 court ne kaha ki karnataka ab 15 hazaar kii jagah har rose 12 hazaar kusek pani de lekin 16 taarikh ke bajaay 20 tarikh tak ye pani diya jaae
 Karnataka is feeling cheated by this decision
 pehle ke aadesh ke mutabik use das din main dedh lakh kusek pani dena tha lekin ab use ek lakh 86 hazaar kusek pani dena padegaa
 Now the Karnataka government has no choice but to implement this decision
 duusari taraf use apni janata ke gusse se nipatane kii bhi taiyaari kerani hogi
 Actually, this whole matter is so complicated that hardly any decision is easily embraced by the people of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka
 aaie pehle is vivaad ko samajhane kii koshish karen
 One of the major rivers of the country, the Kaveri River flows through four states
 karnataka jahaan uskaa udgam he, phir tamilnadu jahaan wo sabase lambii duuri tak bahati he, phir kerala or ant main pandicheri
 After this the river merges into the sea i
e
 the Bay of Bengal
 is nadi ke pani ko lekar in rajyon ke bich hameshaa vivaad rahaa
 Maximum between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu
 isi ko hal karne ke liye 1990 main kaveri nadi jal tribunel banaaya gaya
 In 1991, the tribunal gave an interim award
 iske tahat tamilnadu ko 205 tiemasi feet pani diya gaya
 The final decision came in 2007
 isamen tamilnadu ko final aword main 419 tiemasi feet pani dene kaa faisalaa kiya gaya lekin karnataka ne is par lagaataar etraz kiya he or kaha he ki wo tamilnadu ke liye itnaa pani nahin chhod saktaa
 The first challenge before the Cauvery River Water Tribunal was to see how much and where the water in Cauvery comes from
 jaankaron ne lambii gananaaon ke baad ye nishkarsh nikaala ki monsoon par aadhi nirbharta ke lihaaz se kaveri kaa 740 tiemasi feet pani istemaal ke liye uplabdh hoga
 The next challenge before the tribunal was to divide the 740 TMC feet of water between the four states
 kai saal kii daleelon or visheshgyon ke vichaaron ko jaanane ke baad tribunel ne 419 tiemasi feet pani tamilnadu ko dene kaa faisalaa kiya, 270 tiemasi feet pani karnataka ko, 30 tiemasi feet pani kerala ko or 7 tiemasi feet pani pondicheri ko dene kaa faisalaa kiya
 14 TMC feet of water was left empty for the environment
 is faisale ke baad tribunel ne karnataka ko nirdesh diya ki wo ye sunishchit kare ki 192 tiemasi feet pani salanaa tamilnadu ko mili
 This is where all the confusions started
 isi is tarah samajhen
 In fact, the catchment area inside Karnataka in Kaveri river brings 462 TMC feet of water, it fills with tributaries
 kyonki karnataka ko 270 tiemasi pani hi diya gaya to baaki bachaa 192 tiemasi feet use tamilnadu ke liye chhodana hoga
 Karnataka is not ready for this
 tamilnadu ko agar ye 192 tiemasi feet karnataka se miltaa he to aword ke mutabik 419 tiemasi feet pani puraa kaise hoga
 This 227 TMC ft water actually generates Tamil Nadu in its catchment area
 227 plus 192 milakar hota he 419 tiemasi feet
 In this way, the Cauvery river receives 462 and 227 TMC feet of water from catchment areas in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu
 kaveri nadi jab kerala se hokar bahati he to vahaan ke cachament aria se usamen 51 tiemasi feet pani aata he lekin kerala isamen se 30 tiemasi hi istemaal kar paata he
 The remaining 21 TMC of water is retained in Pondicherry (7) and environmentally (14)
 to labboluab ye he ki karnataka 462 tiemasi feet pani kaveri main daalata he or usamen se use 270 tiemasi feet pani istemaal karne kii ijazat he
 Tamil Nadu pours 227 TMC feet of water and receives 419 TMC feet of water
 kerala 51 tiemasi feet pani daalata he lekin use 30 tiemasi feet pani hi istemaal karne ko miltaa he
 It seems that this is a big injustice to Karnataka
 lekin ye hua kaise
 The answer lies in history, which cannot be rewritten
 hua ye ki chol shaskaon ne jo dasvin shatabdi main tamilnadu par raaj karte the, unhone ye doordarshita dikhaai ki apane rajya main jalashay or checkdam banawaye taaki nadi ke pani ko sinchai ke liye istemaal kiya ja sake
 On the other hand KR Sagar, the first major reservoir in Karnataka was built in 1934 when the rulers of Mysore built it
 aise main tamilnadu ke kisaanon ko shuruaati phayda mila
 When the agreements of 1894 and 1924 were signed, Tamil Nadu used to irrigate 1
5 to 2 million acres, but even more
 karnataka main 1924 tak 6
 There was irrigation in 5 lakh acres and still farming is done in 15 lakh acres
 iskaa matlab ye he ki 1974 tak kaveri ke pani kaa 80% tamilnadu ke kisaan istemaal kar rahe the
 In 1974, Karnataka rejected the 1924 agreement
 to is aitihaasik faayde or doordarshita kii vajah se tamilnadu ko kaveri kaa bada hissaa miltaa rahaa
 After the 1924 agreement, the share of Tamil Nadu which was earlier more than 80 percent came down to 57 percent and the share of Karnataka increased from 16 percent to 37 percent
 tippaniyan So is this award an injustice to Karnataka? Yes
 lekin aitihaasik vajahon se zyaada
 Should Karnataka accept it without protest? No, some aspects of this award require clarity and change
 karnataka ne iske liye 2007 main hi supreme court main ek special live pitishan daal di thi
 Tamil Nadu and Kerala also filed similar petitions as they too were not happy with the award
 lekin abhi tak in par faisalaa nahin hua he
 Anger over the sharing of the Cauvery river water comes out only when the rains are less
 achche monsoon main karnataka or tamilnadu ke bich koi tanaav nahin dikhataa lekin agar barish kam hui to donon hi rajyon main raajnneetik dalon se lekar aam log tak ek duusare ke saamne aa jate hai
 There were reports of sabotage and arson in Mysore as well
 kannada sanghon ne 15 sitambar ko rail rokane kaa elaan kiya he

 hua ye ki chol shaskaon ne jo dasvin shatabdi main tamilnadu par raaj karte the, unhone ye doordarshita dikhaai ki apane rajya main jalashay or checkdam banawaye taaki nadi ke pani ko sinchai ke liye istemaal kiya ja sake
 On the other hand KR Sagar, the first major reservoir in Karnataka was built in 1934 when the rulers of Mysore built it
 aise main tamilnadu ke kisaanon ko shuruaati phayda mila
 When the agreements of 1894 and 1924 were signed, Tamil Nadu used to irrigate 1
5 to 2 million acres, but even more
 karnataka main 1924 tak 6
 There was irrigation in 5 lakh acres and still farming is done in 15 lakh acres
 iskaa matlab ye he ki 1974 tak kaveri ke pani kaa 80% tamilnadu ke kisaan istemaal kar rahe the
 In 1974, Karnataka rejected the 1924 agreement
 to is aitihaasik faayde or doordarshita kii vajah se tamilnadu ko kaveri kaa bada hissaa miltaa rahaa
 After the 1924 agreement, the share of Tamil Nadu which was earlier more than 80 percent came down to 57 percent and the share of Karnataka increased from 16 percent to 37 percent
 tippaniyan So is this award an injustice to Karnataka? Yes
 lekin aitihaasik vajahon se zyaada
 Should Karnataka accept it without protest? No, some aspects of this award require clarity and change
 karnataka ne iske liye 2007 main hi supreme court main ek special live pitishan daal di thi
 Tamil Nadu and Kerala also filed similar petitions as they too were not happy with the award
 lekin abhi tak in par faisalaa nahin hua he
 Anger over the sharing of the Cauvery river water comes out only when the rains are less
 achche monsoon main karnataka or tamilnadu ke bich koi tanaav nahin dikhataa lekin agar barish kam hui to donon hi rajyon main raajnneetik dalon se lekar aam log tak ek duusare ke saamne aa jate hai
 Actually, all this ruckus is about the sharing of the waters of the Cauvery river
 is maamle main supreme court ke faisale kaa karnataka ke kai ilaakon main virodh ho rahaa he
 The response to the violence in Karnataka is also visible in Tamil Nadu
 chennai main somvaar subah kuch log new woodlands naam ke hotel main ghus gaye or todphod kii
 This hotel belongs to a Karnataka company
 aarope he ki todphod karne waalon ne yahaan petrol bam bhi phenkaa or kai parche bhi, jinamein likhaa gaya tha ki agar karnataka main tamilnadu ke logon ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya to iskaa badla liya jayega
 Meanwhile, in Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu, four passenger vehicles from Karnataka were vandalized
 inamen do basen shaamil hai
 a driver was also assaulted
 is sabko dekhte hue karnataka ne tamilnadu ke liye apni bas sevaayen roak di hai
 The effect of this violence has started appearing on TV channels as well
 karnataka main kai jagah tamil bhashaa ke channelon par roak laga di gai he to tamilnadu ke kai shaharon main kannada bhashaa ke channelon par roak laga di gai he
 On one hand, this uproar was going on in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, there was a special hearing on the petition of Karnataka in the Supreme Court in Delhi on the day of Eid
 karnataka kii daleel rahi ki pani ke mudde par kaanoon vyavastha bighad rahi he jis par supreme court ne sakhti se kaha ki kaanoon vyavastha sanbhaalanaa rajya sarkaar kii zimmedaari he
 The Supreme Court then made some changes to its September 5 order
 paanch sitambar ko supreme court ne kaha tha ki karnataka agle das din tak tamilnadu ke liye har rose kaveri nadi kaa 15 hazaar kusek pani jari kare
 But today the Supreme Court reduced the amount of water and extended the days
 court ne kaha ki karnataka ab 15 hazaar kii jagah har rose 12 hazaar kusek pani de lekin 16 taarikh ke bajaay 20 tarikh tak ye pani diya jaae
 Karnataka is feeling cheated by this decision
 pehle ke aadesh ke mutabik use das din main dedh lakh kusek pani dena tha lekin ab use ek lakh 86 hazaar kusek pani dena padegaa
 Now the Karnataka government has no choice but to implement this decision
 duusari taraf use apni janata ke gusse se nipatane kii bhi taiyaari kerani hogi
 Actually, this whole matter is so complicated that hardly any decision is easily embraced by the people of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka
 aaie pehle is vivaad ko samajhane kii koshish karen
 One of the major rivers of the country, the Kaveri River flows through four states
 karnataka jahaan uskaa udgam he, phir tamilnadu jahaan wo sabase lambii duuri tak bahati he, phir kerala or ant main pandicheri
 After this the river merges into the sea i
e
 the Bay of Bengal
 is nadi ke pani ko lekar in rajyon ke bich hameshaa vivaad rahaa
 Maximum between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu
 isi ko hal karne ke liye 1990 main kaveri nadi jal tribunel banaaya gaya
 In 1991, the tribunal gave an interim award
 iske tahat tamilnadu ko 205 tiemasi feet pani diya gaya
 The final decision came in 2007
 isamen tamilnadu ko final aword main 419 tiemasi feet pani dene kaa faisalaa kiya gaya lekin karnataka ne is par lagaataar etraz kiya he or kaha he ki wo tamilnadu ke liye itnaa pani nahin chhod saktaa
 The first challenge before the Cauvery River Water Tribunal was to see how much and where the water in Cauvery comes from
 jaankaron ne lambii gananaaon ke baad ye nishkarsh nikaala ki monsoon par aadhi nirbharta ke lihaaz se kaveri kaa 740 tiemasi feet pani istemaal ke liye uplabdh hoga
 The next challenge before the tribunal was to divide the 740 TMC feet of water between the four states
 kai saal kii daleelon or visheshgyon ke vichaaron ko jaanane ke baad tribunel ne 419 tiemasi feet pani tamilnadu ko dene kaa faisalaa kiya, 270 tiemasi feet pani karnataka ko, 30 tiemasi feet pani kerala ko or 7 tiemasi feet pani pondicheri ko dene kaa faisalaa kiya
 14 TMC feet of water was left empty for the environment
 is faisale ke baad tribunel ne karnataka ko nirdesh diya ki wo ye sunishchit kare ki 192 tiemasi feet pani salanaa tamilnadu ko mili
 This is where all the confusions started
 isi is tarah samajhen
 In fact, the catchment area inside Karnataka in Kaveri river brings 462 TMC feet of water, it fills with tributaries
 kyonki karnataka ko 270 tiemasi pani hi diya gaya to baaki bachaa 192 tiemasi feet use tamilnadu ke liye chhodana hoga
 Karnataka is not ready for this
 tamilnadu ko agar ye 192 tiemasi feet karnataka se miltaa he to aword ke mutabik 419 tiemasi feet pani puraa kaise hoga
 This 227 TMC ft water actually generates Tamil Nadu in its catchment area
 227 plus 192 milakar hota he 419 tiemasi feet
 In this way, the Cauvery river receives 462 and 227 TMC feet of water from catchment areas in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu
 kaveri nadi jab kerala se hokar bahati he to vahaan ke cachament aria se usamen 51 tiemasi feet pani aata he lekin kerala isamen se 30 tiemasi hi istemaal kar paata he
 The remaining 21 TMC of water is retained in Pondicherry (7) and environmentally (14)
 to labboluab ye he ki karnataka 462 tiemasi feet pani kaveri main daalata he or usamen se use 270 tiemasi feet pani istemaal karne kii ijazat he
 Tamil Nadu pours 227 TMC feet of water and receives 419 TMC feet of water
 kerala 51 tiemasi feet pani daalata he lekin use 30 tiemasi feet pani hi istemaal karne ko miltaa he
 It seems that this is a big injustice to Karnataka

 aaie pehle is vivaad ko samajhane kii koshish karen
 One of the major rivers of the country, the Kaveri River flows through four states
 karnataka jahaan uskaa udgam he, phir tamilnadu jahaan wo sabase lambii duuri tak bahati he, phir kerala or ant main pandicheri
 After this the river merges into the sea i
e
 the Bay of Bengal
 is nadi ke pani ko lekar in rajyon ke bich hameshaa vivaad rahaa
 Maximum between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu
 isi ko hal karne ke liye 1990 main kaveri nadi jal tribunel banaaya gaya
 In 1991, the tribunal gave an interim award
 iske tahat tamilnadu ko 205 tiemasi feet pani diya gaya
 The final decision came in 2007
 isamen tamilnadu ko final aword main 419 tiemasi feet pani dene kaa faisalaa kiya gaya lekin karnataka ne is par lagaataar etraz kiya he or kaha he ki wo tamilnadu ke liye itnaa pani nahin chhod saktaa
 The first challenge before the Cauvery River Water Tribunal was to see how much and where the water in Cauvery comes from
 jaankaron ne lambii gananaaon ke baad ye nishkarsh nikaala ki monsoon par aadhi nirbharta ke lihaaz se kaveri kaa 740 tiemasi feet pani istemaal ke liye uplabdh hoga
 The next challenge before the tribunal was to divide the 740 TMC feet of water between the four states
 kai saal kii daleelon or visheshgyon ke vichaaron ko jaanane ke baad tribunel ne 419 tiemasi feet pani tamilnadu ko dene kaa faisalaa kiya, 270 tiemasi feet pani karnataka ko, 30 tiemasi feet pani kerala ko or 7 tiemasi feet pani pondicheri ko dene kaa faisalaa kiya
 14 TMC feet of water was left empty for the environment
 is faisale ke baad tribunel ne karnataka ko nirdesh diya ki wo ye sunishchit kare ki 192 tiemasi feet pani salanaa tamilnadu ko mili
 This is where all the confusions started
 isi is tarah samajhen
 In fact, the catchment area inside Karnataka in Kaveri river brings 462 TMC feet of water, it fills with tributaries
 kyonki karnataka ko 270 tiemasi pani hi diya gaya to baaki bachaa 192 tiemasi feet use tamilnadu ke liye chhodana hoga
 Karnataka is not ready for this
 tamilnadu ko agar ye 192 tiemasi feet karnataka se miltaa he to aword ke mutabik 419 tiemasi feet pani puraa kaise hoga
 This 227 TMC ft water actually generates Tamil Nadu in its catchment area
 227 plus 192 milakar hota he 419 tiemasi feet
 In this way, the Cauvery river receives 462 and 227 TMC feet of water from catchment areas in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu
 kaveri nadi jab kerala se hokar bahati he to vahaan ke cachament aria se usamen 51 tiemasi feet pani aata he lekin kerala isamen se 30 tiemasi hi istemaal kar paata he
 The remaining 21 TMC of water is retained in Pondicherry (7) and environmentally (14)
 to labboluab ye he ki karnataka 462 tiemasi feet pani kaveri main daalata he or usamen se use 270 tiemasi feet pani istemaal karne kii ijazat he
 Tamil Nadu pours 227 TMC feet of water and receives 419 TMC feet of water
 kerala 51 tiemasi feet pani daalata he lekin use 30 tiemasi feet pani hi istemaal karne ko miltaa he
 It seems that this is a big injustice to Karnataka
 lekin ye hua kaise
 The answer lies in history, which cannot be rewritten
 hua ye ki chol shaskaon ne jo dasvin shatabdi main tamilnadu par raaj karte the, unhone ye doordarshita dikhaai ki apane rajya main jalashay or checkdam banawaye taaki nadi ke pani ko sinchai ke liye istemaal kiya ja sake
 On the other hand KR Sagar, the first major reservoir in Karnataka was built in 1934 when the rulers of Mysore built it
 aise main tamilnadu ke kisaanon ko shuruaati phayda mila
 When the agreements of 1894 and 1924 were signed, Tamil Nadu used to irrigate 1
5 to 2 million acres, but even more
 karnataka main 1924 tak 6
 There was irrigation in 5 lakh acres and still farming is done in 15 lakh acres
 iskaa matlab ye he ki 1974 tak kaveri ke pani kaa 80% tamilnadu ke kisaan istemaal kar rahe the
 In 1974, Karnataka rejected the 1924 agreement
 to is aitihaasik faayde or doordarshita kii vajah se tamilnadu ko kaveri kaa bada hissaa miltaa rahaa
 After the 1924 agreement, the share of Tamil Nadu which was earlier more than 80 percent came down to 57 percent and the share of Karnataka increased from 16 percent to 37 percent
 tippaniyan So is this award an injustice to Karnataka? Yes
 lekin aitihaasik vajahon se zyaada
 Should Karnataka accept it without protest? No, some aspects of this award require clarity and change
 karnataka ne iske liye 2007 main hi supreme court main ek special live pitishan daal di thi
 Tamil Nadu and Kerala also filed similar petitions as they too were not happy with the award
 lekin abhi tak in par faisalaa nahin hua he
 Anger over the sharing of the Cauvery river water comes out only when the rains are less
 achche monsoon main karnataka or tamilnadu ke bich koi tanaav nahin dikhataa lekin agar barish kam hui to donon hi rajyon main raajnneetik dalon se lekar aam log tak ek duusare ke saamne aa jate hai
 There was always a dispute between these states regarding the water of this river
 sabase zyaada karnataka or tamilnadu ke bich
 In order to solve this, the Cauvery River Water Tribunal was formed in 1990
 1991 main tribunel ne ek antarim aword diya
 Under this, Tamil Nadu was given 205 TMC feet of water
 2007 main antim faisalaa aayaa
 It decided to give 419 TMC feet of water to Tamil Nadu in the final award but Karnataka has consistently objected to this and said that it cannot release so much water for Tamil Nadu
 kaveri nadi jal tribunel ke saamne pehali chunauti ye dekhnaa thi ki kaveri main pani he kitna or kahaan-kahaan se aata he
 Experts concluded after long calculations that 740 TMC ft of Cauvery water would be available for use in terms of half dependence on monsoon
 tribunel ke saamne agali chunauti thi is 740 tiemasi feet pani ko chaar rajyon ke bich baantnaa
 Knowing the views of several years of pleas and experts, the tribunal decided to give 419 TMC feet of water to Tamil Nadu, 270 TMC feet of water to Karnataka, 30 TMC feet of water to Kerala and 7 TMC feet of water to Pondicherry
 14 tiemasi feet pani ko paryaavaran ke lihaaz se khaali chhod diya gaya
 After this decision, the tribunal directed Karnataka to ensure that Tamil Nadu gets 192 TMC feet of water annually
 yaheen par sara kanfuzan shuru hua
 Think of it this way
 darasal kaveri nadi main karnataka ke andar ke cachament ilaake main 462 tiemasi feet pani aata he, ye sahaayak nadiyon se bharta he
 Because Karnataka was given 270 TMC of water, the remaining 192 TMC feet would have to be left for Tamil Nadu
 karnataka iske liye taiyaar nahin he
 If Tamil Nadu gets 192 TMC feet from Karnataka, then according to the award, how will 419 TMC feet of water be fulfilled
 ye 227 tiemasi feet pani darasal tamilnadu khud apane cachament aria main janaret karata he
 227 Plus 192 Consists of 419 TMC ft
 is tarah kaveri nadi main karnataka or tamilnadu ke cachament aria se kul milakar 462 or 227 tiemasi feet pani aata he
 When the Cauvery river flows through Kerala, it gets 51 TMC feet of water from the catchment area there, but Kerala is able to use only 30 TMC of it
 bache hue 21 tiemasi pani ko pandicherry (7) or paryaavaran ke lihaaz se (14) rakhaa gaya he
 So the bottom line is that Karnataka puts 462 TMC feet of water in Kaveri and from that it is allowed to use 270 TMC feet of water
 tamilnadu 227 tiemasi feet pani daalata he or 419 tiemasi feet pani paata he
 Kerala pours 51 TMC feet of water but gets only 30 TMC feet of water
 dekhne main lagata he ki karnataka ke saath ye bada anyaay he
 But how did this happen? iskaa jawaab itihaas main he jise dobaaraa nahin likhaa ja saktaa
 It happened that the Chola rulers who ruled Tamil Nadu in the tenth century showed the foresight to build reservoirs and check dams in their state so that river water could be used for irrigation
 duusari ore karnataka main pehla bada jalashay keaar sagar 1934 main bana jab mysore ke shaskaon ne use banwaaya
 In such a situation, the farmers of Tamil Nadu got the initial benefit
 1894 or 1924 ke samjhauton par jab dastakhat hue to tamilnadu ke 15 se 20 lakh acre ilaake balki usase bhi zyaada main sinchai hoti thi
 6 till 1924 in Karnataka
 5 lakh acre main sinchai hoti thi or ab bhi 15 lakh acre main hi kheti hoti he
 This means that Tamil Nadu farmers were using 80% of Cauvery water by 1974
 1974 main karnataka ne 1924 main hue samjhaute ko khaarij kar diya
 So due to this historical advantage and foresight, Tamil Nadu continued to get a large share of Cauvery
 1924 ke samjhaute ke baad tamilnadu kaa jo hissaa pehle 80 fisadi se zyaada tha wo ghatakar 57 fisadi par aa gaya or karnataka kaa hissaa 16 fisadi se badhkar 37 fisadi ho gaya
 The comments to kya ye aword karnataka ke saath anyaay he? haa he
 But more than historical reasons
 kya karnataka bina virodh ke ise sweekaar kar le? nahin, is aword ke kuch pahaluon par spashtataa or badlaav kii zarurat he
 Karnataka had put a special leave petition for this in the Supreme Court in 2007 itself
 tamilnadu or kerala ne bhi aisi hi yachikaayen daaleen kyonki wo bhi aword se khush nahin the
 But they have not been decided yet
 kaveri nadi jal bantwaare ko lekar gussa tabhi saamne aata he jab barish kam hoti he
 There is no tension between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu in a good monsoon, but if the rains are less, then from both the political parties to common people in both the states come in front of each other

 kaveri nadi jal bantwaare ko lekar gussa tabhi saamne aata he jab barish kam hoti he
 There is no tension between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu in a good monsoon, but if the rains are less, then from both the political parties to common people in both the states come in front of each other
 aise main tamilnadu ke kisaanon ko shuruaati phayda mila
 When the agreements of 1894 and 1924 were signed, Tamil Nadu used to irrigate 1
5 to 2 million acres, but even more
 karnataka main 1924 tak 6
 There was irrigation in 5 lakh acres and still farming is done in 15 lakh acres
 iskaa matlab ye he ki 1974 tak kaveri ke pani kaa 80% tamilnadu ke kisaan istemaal kar rahe the
 In 1974, Karnataka rejected the 1924 agreement
 to is aitihaasik faayde or doordarshita kii vajah se tamilnadu ko kaveri kaa bada hissaa miltaa rahaa
 After the 1924 agreement, the share of Tamil Nadu which was earlier more than 80 percent came down to 57 percent and the share of Karnataka increased from 16 percent to 37 percent
 tippaniyan So is this award an injustice to Karnataka? Yes
 lekin aitihaasik vajahon se zyaada
 Should Karnataka accept it without protest? No, some aspects of this award require clarity and change
 karnataka ne iske liye 2007 main hi supreme court main ek special live pitishan daal di thi
 Tamil Nadu and Kerala also filed similar petitions as they too were not happy with the award
 lekin abhi tak in par faisalaa nahin hua he
 Anger over the sharing of the Cauvery river water comes out only when the rains are less
 achche monsoon main karnataka or tamilnadu ke bich koi tanaav nahin dikhataa lekin agar barish kam hui to donon hi rajyon main raajnneetik dalon se lekar aam log tak ek duusare ke saamne aa jate hai
 6 till 1924 in Karnataka
 5 lakh acre main sinchai hoti thi or ab bhi 15 lakh acre main hi kheti hoti he
 This means that Tamil Nadu farmers were using 80% of Cauvery water by 1974
 1974 main karnataka ne 1924 main hue samjhaute ko khaarij kar diya
 So due to this historical advantage and foresight, Tamil Nadu continued to get a large share of Cauvery
 1924 ke samjhaute ke baad tamilnadu kaa jo hissaa pehle 80 fisadi se zyaada tha wo ghatakar 57 fisadi par aa gaya or karnataka kaa hissaa 16 fisadi se badhkar 37 fisadi ho gaya
 The comments to kya ye aword karnataka ke saath anyaay he? haa he
 But more than historical reasons
 kya karnataka bina virodh ke ise sweekaar kar le? nahin, is aword ke kuch pahaluon par spashtataa or badlaav kii zarurat he
 Karnataka had put a special leave petition for this in the Supreme Court in 2007 itself
 tamilnadu or kerala ne bhi aisi hi yachikaayen daaleen kyonki wo bhi aword se khush nahin the

 6 children have been evacuated after a lot of effort in Thailand's cave
 bacchon ko baahar gotakhoron kii madad se baahar nikaala gaya he
 But this work was extremely difficult
 bacchon ko gupha se surakshit nikaalane ke liye anya upayon par bhi kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 One of them is Baby Submarine
 america ke sabase amir logon main shaamil or spesex or testla ke siio alan musk bacchon kii madad karne ke liye aage aae hai
 Musk has said that his company is building a small submarine that can go inside this cave
 khaas baat ye hogi ki ise rocket ke parts se taiyaar kiya jayega
 However, the way the rescue operation is going on, it is expected that without this submarine, children will be taken out safely
 lekin phir bhi kisi bhi sthiti ko dekhte hue baby sabamarine bhi taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Elon Musk has given this information through his official Twitter handle
 musk ne twit main kaha, 'thailand se behatar pratikriya milane ke baad ham bacchon ke aakaar vaali pandubbi ko banane ke liye kaam kar rahe hai
 The submarine will operate through a liquid oxygen transfer tube of the Falcon rocket
 ye pandubbi vajan main kaaphi halki hogi or 2 gotaakhor ise le ja sakenge
 It will also be very strong and it can be easily extracted from the narrow paths of the cave
 'some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand
 Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try
 Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks
 Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does
 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk)july 7, 2018kai or twits main musk ne jaankaree di he ki is pandubbi main 8 hitch points honge, jinamein 4 aage or 4 peeche kii taraf honge
 Also, 4 air tanks will be connected to prevent leakage
 saath hi kuch sawaalon ke jawaab dete hue twitor par musk ne jaankaree di ki is pandubbi ko lagbhag 8 ghante main taiyaar kar liya jayega or flite se ise thailand pahunchane main 17 ghante kaa vakt lagegaa
 How to reach the cave On June 23, a team named Wild Boers played a football match
 bachche hameshaa kii tarah mouj masti karnaa chaahate the
 The team reached the cave while cycling
 res main 13waan ladkaa bhi tha
 But for some reason he had to return
 ve alag-alag raste se andar ghuste ja rahe the
 There was so much rain that the cave was flooded
 baahar nikalne kaa ek hi rasta tha or vah puri tarah band ho chukaa tha
 By night, when the children did not return home, the family members were upset
 isaki khabar prashasan ko di gai
 The administration went in search
 thailand kii navy sil is oparation main laga di gai
 Eight countries including Australia, England, China engaged in rescue
 aakhirkaar ghota lagaate hue rescue team bacchon ke kareeb tak pahunchi, lekin abhi ve pravesh ddhaar se 4 kimi dur the
 It takes a trained swimmer 6 hours to get there and 5 hours to leave
 logon ko laga rahtakarmi bacchon ko lekar aaenge, lekin gupha ke andar kai jagah aisi hai jahaan tairaaki kerani he, aisi sthiti main ek prashikshit tairaak hi tair saktaa he
 The rain always fills these caves and descends till the month of September
 9 din tak bacchon ne khaanaa nahin khaaya, sirf baadh ke pani ke sahare hi jinda the
 The children did not even know how long they were stranded
 pahaado ke neeche gupha he
 Some paths go up and some down
 har raste ko jodne vaale main pani bhar hua he
 Children neither swim nor dive
 bacchon ko swimming or diving sikhaai ja rahi he
 a team of doctors has arrived inside the cave
 gotaakhor ne khaanaa pahunchaa diya he
 Arrangements have been made for children for 4 months
 baatcheet ke liye phone bhi pahunchaaya gaya, lekin bhigane se vah bhi kharaab ho gaya
 Pumped to remove water
 gupha kaa jalastr 16 centimetre tak ghat chukaa he
 But the water is being filled again by leaking from the mountain
 dar he ki agar phir tej barish hui to jahaan bacchon ne sharan lee he, vah jagah dhans sakati he or agle kuch din baari barish kii chetavanee he
 Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Monday lashed out at Narendra Modi and Lal Krishna Advani after the National Integration Council meeting
 unhone kaha ki modi kabhi bhi desh ke piem nahin banenge isliye ve nakli laal kile se hi apni manshaa puri kar rahe hai
 He accused Advani of playing against the promise of Babri Masjid
 lalu ke mutabik adwani ne tatkaaleen pradhanmantri pi ve narsinha raav ko bharosa dilaayaa tha ki vivaadit dhaanche ko koi nuksaan nahin hoga par vahaan vidhwans hua
 In a meeting of the National Integration Council on Monday, while taking a dig at Narendra Modi's absence, he said that Modi knew that today he would be dragged heavily so he did not come
 iske alaava unhone ashanka jataai ki aane vaale chunaav desh ke liye khatarnaak ho sakate hai
 Because communal forces can resort to riots to polarize
 aise main dharmanirpeksh partiyon kaa ek saath aana jaruri he
 Lalu Prasad said, '2014 election is very dangerous
 fasivadi or sampradayik takatein desh kii ekta or akhandta ko khandit karke dilli kii gaddi paanaa chaahati he
 Hence large-scale riots will be organized so that there is communal polarization of the society

 After these rebellious remarks of Sharad Yadav, his party JDU has told him clearly that whatever Sharad Yadav has to say, he should say before the party leaders
 vahiin patna main 19 agast ko party kii kaaryakarini baithak honi he, isamen bhi vah apana paksh rakh sakate hai
 JDU General Secretary KC Tyagi told Aaj Tak that Sharad Yadav should exercise restraint and remain in dignity till the 19th
 tyaagi ne sharad yadav or lalu prasad yadav ke bich santhganth kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 He said that Sharad Yadav is with Lalten in the dark path on which he has walked
 isse pehle khabar ai thi ki baghawat par utaru sharad yadav ko party baahar kaa rasta dikhaa sakati he
 However, he denied Tyagi saying that the party has not made up its mind to take any action against Sharad Yadav and neither is there going to be any division in the party

 The matter is about two months old
 rajdhani dilli ke mayur vihaar ilaake main maamuli si baat par ek noujvaan ko aadhi raat ke vakt goli maar kar maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya tha
 The case was of murder, so the police started investigating the case rapidly
 police kaatilon kaa suraag lagane kii koshish kar rahi thi
 But nothing was coming
 katl kii ye gutthi sulajhati ja rahi thi
 a few days later, the law finally reached the murderer
 dilli police ne use giraftaar kar liya
 When the police gathered information about him, it came to know that the accused murderer is a vicious crook of Ghaziabad
 phir maamle kii parten khulanaa shuru huin
 According to the police, the accused reached a store in Mayur Vihar that night of a miscreant incident
 vahiin maktul yogesh bhi kuch saamaan lene aayaa tha
 i do not know what started the fight between the two
 isi dauraan yogesh ne aaropee kii car kaa sheesha tod diya
 Then what was the accused took out the pistol and shot it in anger
 goli sidhi maktul ko jaakar lagi or wo hameshaa ke liye maut kii neend so gaya
 What was revealed by the police after investigation and questioning was also shocking
 police ke mutabik mayur vihaar main ek departmental store ke baahar mahaz kandhaa tach hone or parking ke jhagade main ye katl hua
 The vicious miscreant named Siddhant Varma carried out
 vah gajiabad kaa hi rahane vaala he
 In fact, the police enlisted the help of local intelligence, technical surveillance and other clues to solve this murder
 jab jaakar shaatir badmaash siddhant giraftaar kiya gaya
 During the interrogation, he not only confessed after killing a boy named Yogesh in a fit of anger, but also told that after a fight with Yogesh that night he had also killed a dialogue to scare Yogesh
 usne katl se pehle yogesh se kaha tha ki "jitani teri umr nahin he, usase zyaada mujhpe cese lage hai
 "by the way, this jumla of this truncated crook had its place, because more than thirty cases of crime have been registered even before this murder
 pandav nagar police ke mutabik 9 november kii raat kareeb 1 baje siddhant naamak badmaash 24X7 naam ke ek departmental store ke baahar khadaa tha
 He had reached there to eat something with a friend in his car
 tabhi yogesh vahaan apane biimaar bhai ke liye kuch kharidne pahunchaa
 At the same time, there was a fight between the two first about the parking of the car and then both the shoulders got touched by each other at the store gate
 bas isi baat par donon main vivaad kuch itnaa badha ki yogesh ne gusse main aakar vahiin padi ek rod se siddhant kii car kaa sheesha tod diya
 This made the theory so angry that he fired five shots at Yogesh and escaped
 udhar, yogesh ke dost use lekar aspataal pahunche
 He was shot two and the doctors called him dead
 qatl kii is sansanikhej vaardaat ne puure ilaake main sansani failaa di
 According to the police, through the CCTV footage of the cameras installed outside the 24 × 7, local network and other inputs, the police was able to get to know the theory
 siddhant ne police se bachane ke liye apni dadhi mudwa lee thi or gaadi kaa number plate bhi change kar lee thi
 But at last he got caught by the police
 baharhaal, ab police ne is maamle ko to sulajhaa liya he
 But the wounds of Yogesh's family will never heal
 yogesh shaadishuda tha or use ek beti bhi he, jabaki uski vife pregnent he
 In such a situation, anger only destroyed the whole family
