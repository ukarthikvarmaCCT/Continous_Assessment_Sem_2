 puri duniya main cricket ko pasand karne vaale log purv bhartiya cricketer anil kumble ko sammaan bhari najaron se dekhte hai
 He has always been known as a player who has given his 100% in the team interest
 apane game ke str ko upar uthaane ke liye kadi training kii
 There has always been puzzles for opposition teams
 vaise bhartiya cricket kii behatari chaahane waalon ke liye ek khushkhabari he ki ve agle 1 saal ke liye bhartiya cricket team ke coach banane ja rahe hai
 Here you can learn a lot from his simple and combative personality
 
 
 1
 Do whatever you decide to show
 
 
 (determination)jindagi or cricket kii pich main kuch khaas antar nahin he
 Despite doing good many times, good results do not come, yet you have to be constantly engaged
 kabhi aap team se baahar ho jate hai
 In such a situation, instead of getting frustrated, focus on basics and approach
 der-saver phir se kismat aap par muskuraaegi or safalataa jhak maar kar aapkaa varan karegi
 2
 puri lagan se kaam karen
 
 
 (devotion) Significantly, Kumble joined the Indian cricket team as a leg-spinner and remained the same till the end, but gradually he started throwing the ball at the pace of medium paceer
 ve apni dhardaar or teji vaali gendon se achche-achche ballebaajon ko chhathi kaa doodh yaad dilaa dete the
 The things that make Kohli so great
 
 
 3
 Discipline is the ladder to success
 
 
 (discipline)aisa ham sabhi ke saath aksar ho jaataa he ki ham jane-anjaane main kai niyamon kii andekhi kar dete hai, lekin kumble ko hameshaa se aise shaks ke taur par janaa jaataa rahaa he jo sthapit niyamon ko puraa tarjeeh detaa rahaa he
 Probably because of being disciplined, he remained a part of the Indian cricket team for so long
 hamen bhi unsinushasan seekhneyki jarurat he
 See what the journey of Rahane teaches us
 
 
 4
 To be sincere to work 
 
 (dedication)aisa lagata hi nahin ki kumble ne kabhi cricket ko alavida kaha
 He was constantly in touch with the game
 bhartiya cricket team se vidaai ke baad ve ipel main bhi jalwe bikherte rahe
 Always kept myself updated with the new rules and regulations of the game
 shaayad yahi vajah thi ki desh-duniya ke tamaam diggajon ke baavjood unhen bhartiya cricket team kaa coach manonith kiya gaya
 Some of his merits worth noting - 5
 hameshaa khud ko sanyat rakhana
 
 
 Anil Kumble has always been known as a player who does not lose his cool under some adverse circumstances
 vipareet paristhitiyonmen bhi muskuraate rahete hai
 They make moves such that the opposition can dodge
 agar aapako pani he sina jaisi safalataa to
 
 
 6
 hameshaa team ko rakhen aage
 
 
 Now everyone is aware that cricket is a team game where personal records also have their own importance
 kumble ko bhartiya cricket kaa sabase safalmatch vinarhone kaa tamgaa praapt he
 In a country where only batsmen are credited with victory
 thik usee desh main anil kumble kaa bhartiya falak par aakar chaa janaa bahut kuch kahata he
 7
 nevar se daai spirit
 
 
 Do you remember the photo of Anil Kumble throwing a ball to the opposition, who has been stripped to the face despite having a broken jaw? If you don't remember, google it
 main nahin samajhataa ki iske baad mujhe kuch kehane kii jarurat he
 Hats off to you jumbo jet

 pehle bhi dikhe shivasena ke talkh tevarvaise ye pehali baar nahin he jab shivasena ne modi sarkaar ke khilaaf talkh tevar dikhaae hon
 The relationship between the two was soured only when Shiv Sena, the 18-member parliamentarian, got just one berth in the Modi government
 shivasena ke jaale par namak tab chhidaka jab piem modi ne shivasena netaa suresh prabhu ko bina uddhav kii sahmati ke na sirf cabinet main shaamil kiya balki unhen rail mantralay jaisaa ahm vibhaag bhi thama diya
 Opposing Modi's policies, be it a bullet train of demonetisation or demonetisation, Pak policy or debt waiver of farmers, Shiv Sena has been continuously targeting the Modi government
 duusari ore bijepi ne bhi shivasena ke tikhe tewaron ko kabhi bhav nahin diya
 Modi has expanded the cabinet thrice, but the Shiv Sena was ignored

 BMC election not fought in alliance The tussle between Shiv Sena and BJP was seen most when both parties announced to contest separate assembly elections in Maharashtra, breaking their decades-old alliance
 yahaan bhi shivasena ko munh kii khaani padi
 The results went in favor of the BJP and the Shiv Sena had no choice but to be part of the Fadnavis government
 yahaan tak ki isi saal biemasi chunaav bhi donon partiyon ne alag-alag ladaa
 The Shiv Sena may have announced the final decision on an alliance with the BJP but it will not be easy for them to decide to separate
 party ko endie se alag hone kii keemat centre va rajya kii satta se baahar hokar chukaani padegi
 While its separation will not affect the central government and the Fadnavis government of Maharashtra will also have the option to save the government by meeting the NCP
 aise main kya uddhav thakare itnaa saahas dikhaa paaenge, ki janata ke muddon ko lekar endie se alag ho jaaen or bijepi ke khilaaf sadakon par utarkar apana janaadhar badhayen

 09 lakh rupees north korea or america ke bich ab maamla sanjeeda ho chukaa he
 Between the leaders of these two countries, the matter has now increased to such an extent that the danger of war has started to bear
 jang kisi bhi vaqt shuru ho sakati he
 In such a situation, it is important that we know how far the devastation will reach if this happens
 kahin ye vishwayuddh kii aahat to nahin
 Because on one side the Arab country is sitting on the other side of the Korean Peninsula Jung volcano
 or upar se america north korea ke taanashaah ko taish dilaane kii koi kasar nahin chhod rahaa he
 Now if there is a war somewhere, guess what will happen then? America's North Korea is under attack by everyone, nobody is leisurely
 chaiyn he ki aata hi nahin or aayega bhi kyon kar
 Things are like this now
 ek taraf south korea, america, japan or china apane apane hathiyaaron se las hai
 Just waiting for the bugle to blow
 to duusari taraf maidan main akelaa khadaa north korea kaa taanashaah is baat ko lekar kashmakash main he ki wo apni mixilon kaa ruukh kis ore kare
 Therefore, he has decided that the attack should be from one side to any place and that is America
 bakaul north korea ke is taanashaah kim jong un ke uske paas isaki vaazib vajah bhi he
 Because after the attack on Syria, now the attitude of America has become completely war and that is why it has sent its warships in Korean Peninsula
 lihaaza kim jong un ne america ko aakhri chetavanee di he ki jang ke liye taiyaar rahen
 If you want to understand this annoyance of North Korikim Jong alone, then understand this map first because after this the picture will be more clear
 bhale yahaan se america kii duuri kareeb 10 hazaar kilometre ho, magar south korea kii sarhad usase lagati he
 And America's other partner, Japan, is just a thousand kilometers
 china se bhi rishte koi bahut behatar nahin hai
 Because Kim Jong is also afraid of poisonous missiles
 le de ke uske pados main rus hi ek aisa desh he jiske saath communiston ke daur main uskaa dostana rishta rahaa he
 But at present, the situation is such that North Korea considers itself alone
 akele dam par hi wo america se loha lene ko na sirf taiyaar baitha he balki barabari kii jang kaa dam bhi bhar rahaa he
 On the other hand, the Trump government of America is also making full preparations before the war
 korian prayadweep par usne apane strike group bhej die hai
 Which also has Nimitz class aircraft
 uassoes karl vinson bhi or ek karier wing ke alaava do missile destroir or ek gided missile kruger shaamil he
 Now it is evident that if the United States shows its strength by coming so close to the North Korean frame, then Kim is not one of those who sit silent
 lihaaza hathiyaaron kii jang se pehle zubaani jang shuru ho chuki he
 America prepares for war, North Korea's Foreign Ministry has said that the decision to ship to America is a hasty step
 wo hamaari simaaon main ghusane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 If the United States wants to fight, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (north Korea) is ready for it
 darasal, syria par hamale ke fouran baad donald trump ke haunsale kaaphi bade hue hai
 Therefore, the Trump Administration's decision to send warships to Korean peninsula is considered a final warning for Kim Jong-un
 haalanki trump ne apane adwisers se ye bhi kaha he ki agar pyongyang naram ruukh apanaae to wo duusare kai opshans par vichaar kar sakate hai
 But seeing the current situation, it does not seem so
 duusari taraf north korea par hamale ko lekar china kaa bhi maamla danvadol hi nazar aa rahaa he
 Experts believe that China is threatened by Kim but not so much that he stands with the US
 america bhi ye samaj rahaa he lihaaza usne ye bhi kah diya he ki china agar saath nahin degaa to wo akele hi north korea ke khilaaf ection legaa
 Nuclear can test North Korea, however it will not be so easy for the US to attack North Korea because it knows that this most cynical dictator in the world has many missiles that recommend nuclear explosions to America
 north korea kii sthapana karne vaale apane dada kim sang kii 105veen salgirah ke maukey par aisi sambhaavna he ki wo chatha newclear test kar saktaa he
 In such a situation, if the conditions of war are created, then it can be said that America does not know but North Korea has nothing to lose
 korian samandar main ho saktaa he bheeshan ghamasanazaahir he maujuuda vaqt main america ko agar kisi se khatara he to wo north korea kaa sanakee taanashaah hi he
 Therefore, President Trump has made it clear that this time America is in a cross mood
 apane jangi jahaazon ko korian peninsula main utaar kar america ne north korea ko aakhri chetavanee de di he or agar kim jong un ke adiyal ravaiyye main koi tabdili nahin ai to ye jaan lijie ki korian prayadweep ke samandar main phir bheeshan ghamaasan hoga

 a photo frame hangs on the wall of Tejashwi Yadav's office in Patna — his father Lalu Prasad Yadav is seen in an in-depth conversation with the state Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 ve kehete hai, ''ye tasviren ateet ke aitihaasik kshanon kii hai
 28-year-old Tejashwi has now become a smarter politician than ever before
 ve apane pita or bade bhai tej pratap yadav kii tulana main bhaawanaaon ko kaabo main rakhana sikh gaye hai or apni yogyata sabit bhi kar rahe hai
 Analysts say the recent by-elections — Araria (lok Sabha), and Jehanabad and Bhabhua (legislative Assembly), could pave the way for Tejashwi's rise in Bihar
 ranchi kii jail main band lalu kii gaiyr-maujuudagi main bhi tejasvi ne arriya or jahanabad main party ko shandaar safalataa dilaai
 RJD candidate Sarfaraz Alam won Araria by 55,000 votes and Sujay Yadav won in Jehanabad in central Bihar by 35,000 votes
 in chunaav nateezon ne rajya main bhaajapa-jad(you) gathbandhan ke ajey hone dharna khatm kar di
 Tejashwi held 12 big public meetings in Araria and four in Jehanabad
 chunaav prachaar se pehle ve bihar main gum-ghumkar nyaay yatraaen bhi kar chuke the, jisase lalu ke paramparaagat janaadhar ko phir se majboot karne main madad mili
 The stunning Mahadalit leader Jitan Ram was also successful in pulling Manjhi towards himself
 maanjhi ne upachunaav prachaar ke bich main hi paala badal liya tha, jisase jad (you) ke ummidavaar abhiram sharma ko jahanabad main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Unlike his father and other family members, Tejashwi is a politician with a serious temperament, not like the Lalu court leaders known for laughter
 ve apane 'chaachaaon'—nitish or upmukhyamantri susheel modi kii tarah soch-samajhakar munh kholane vaale vyakti hai
 Experts point to their quality and state that they do not accuse anyone quickly without concrete evidence

 duty sabase zyada hamaari
 We should have no objection to the facility the army gets
 lekin hamaare saath itnaa bhedbhaav kyon? hamako bhi to milani chahie
 Friends, if you agree with me, then proceed this video as much as you can

 Musharraf said this a few hours after the Pakistani court granted anticipatory bail
 adaalat ne vibhinn maamalon main musharraf ko 10 din kii jamaanat dekar kareeb paanch saal ke swanirvaasan ke baad turant giraftaar hone ke bhay se mukt hokar ghar waapas lautne kaa rasta bana diya he
 Musharraf, who took power in 1999 and stepped down as president in 2008, is wanted in Pakistan for conspiring to murder and illegally arresting judges
 unhone kaha tha, ‘do sau pratishat
 
 main ravivaar ko pakistan ja rahaa hum
 'he had said,' i will go by road, air and sea by any route
 phir chaahe meri jaan ko khatra kyon naa ho
 i swear this for my country
 ’musharraf ke mutabik, ‘koi giraftaar nahin hogi or kuch nahin hoga

 kalibanga ke mitti ke tile khamosh khadey hai
 If they were not saved neatly in large walls with black iron bars, then it is difficult to realize that we are standing on the land of ancestors where once the saraswati-indus river valley civilization breathed
 mitti ke in dhuhon ke peeche gehun ke lahalhate khet hai
 The map inscribed on the board of the archeology department on the side reminds that the Saraswati river once surrounded these mounds and flowed, and today its 21st century crop is flowing in its flow area
 vaise to aaj bhi barsaat ke mausam main yahaan se ek choti-si nadi ghagghar kuch din ke liye bahati he, lekin us mahanadi ke saamne is barsaati pokhar kii kya bisaat, jisaki god main kabhi duniya kii sabase puraani sabhyataaon main se ek fal-phool rahi thi
 From Oldham to IIT Where did that river disappear? 120 years ago today in 1893 the same question was an English engineer c
 epa
 Had emerged in Oldham's mind when he passed through the dry valley of this river on his horse
 tab oldham ne pehali pariklpana di ki ho na ho, yah pracheen vishaal nadi saraswati kii ghati he, jisamen sutluj nadi kaa pani miltaa tha
 And whom the sage-sages wrote in the Rigveda (richa 2
 41
 16) In "ambi Tame, Nadi Tame, Devi Tame Saraswati" means the greatest mother, the biggest river, the biggest goddess
 rugveda main is bhubhag ke varnan main pashchim main sindhu or purv main saraswati nadi ke bich paanch nadiyon jhelum, chenab, sutluj, raavi or vyas kii upasthiti kaa zikr he
 Rigveda (richa 7
 36
 6) describes Saraswati as the mother of the Indus and other rivers
 is nadi ke lupt hone ko lekar oldham ne vichaar diya ki kudarat ne karavat badali or sutluj ke pani ne sindhu nadi kaa rukh kar liya
 Poor Saraswati dried up
 ek sadi se zyada ke vakt main vigyaan or takanic ne raftaar pakadi or saraswati ke swaroop ko lekar ek-duusare ko katati hui kai pariklpanaaen saamne ain
 The final chapter is yet to be written in this regard
 1990 ke dashak main mili satellite chitron se pehali baar us nadi kaa motaa khaakaa duniya ke saamne aayaa
 These maps show an underground river valley-like shape from the Himalayas to the Arabian Sea, about 20 km in width
 ab jigyaasa yah thi ki koi nadi itani chaudaai main to nahin bah sakati, to aakhir us nadi kastic rasta or aakaar kya tha? or uske vilupt hone kii sachhee kahani kya he? in sawaalon ke jawaab dhundgaye ke liye 2011 ke ant main iity kanpur ke saath kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay (varanasi) or landan ke imperial college ke visheshgyon ne shodh shuru kiya
 In this project, we used the electrical resistance sounding technique
 is takanic se jameen ke bheetar pani kii paraton kii sateek motaai kaa akalan kiya jaataa he
 We had to ensure that a large river flowed between the Yamuna and Sutlej rivers in the West Ganges basin
 yah nadi kaansya yug or hadappa kaaleen puraatatv sthalon ke paas se bahati thi
 Some three and a half thousand years ago, this civilization vanished by changing the waters of the river
 haalanki sabhyataa ke lupt hone kii duusari vajahen bhi ho sakati hai
 "ranjit Sinha, in-charge of the project and Professor of the Department of Civil Engineering at IIT Kanpur, held this new discovery role
 isse kuch samay pehle hi america main mississippi nadi ghati ke bhoojal tantra kaa adhyayan karne ke liye is takanic kaa safalataa se prayog kiya ja chukaa he
 Apart from this, this technique has also been successful in mapping the lost streams of the Nile River near the Nile Delta in the equatorial region of Egypt
 nil nadi kii lupt dhaaraon ke bare main bane is nae nakshe ne kai aitihaasik manyataon ko chunauti bhi di he
 In order to find out these evidences of the underground network of Saraswati river using sound resistance technique, the team in the first phase, the archeological site lying between Patiala and Ludhiana in Punjab, Munak village near Kunal, Sarhind village between Ludhiana and Chandigarh and Rajasthan
 Selected Harappan archaeological site Kalibanga in Hanumangarh district
 2012 ke ant or sadi ke pehle mahakumbh se pehle pro
 a research paper was published in Sinha and his team in the Quaternary Journal of the International Union of Quaternary Research
 iskaa sheershak tha: jio electric racistivity avidence for sabasarphes peleochannel systams adjacent tu hadappan cites in northwest india
 It claimed: "this study presents geophysical evidence for the underground water system of ghaggar-hakra rivers for the first time
 ” yah shodhpatr yojana ke pehle charan ke puraa hone ke baad saamne aayaa or saakshyon kii talash main abhi yah lupt saraswati kii ghati main pashchim kii ore badhata jayega
 Evidence originating from the higher Himalayas has confirmed the hypothesis that the Saraswati river, like the Ghaggar, originated from the higher Himalayas, the origin of rivers like the Indus and Sutlej, at the foothills of the Himalayas
 adhyayan kii shuruyaat ghagghar nadi kii vartmaan dhara se kahin dur sarhind gaanv se hui or pehle nattejey hi chaunkaane vaale aae
 "in fact, Yashpal's research paper in 1980 mentioned the presence of a lost potential tributary of the ghaggar-hakra rivers at this place," says Sinha
 ham isi sahaayak nadi kii maujuudagi kii pushti ke liye sakshya juta rahe the
 "but the result that came out revealed a 40 to 50 meter thick layer of sand filled with clear water at the very bottom of the ground in Sirhind
 yah ghati jameen ke bheetar 20 kimi main faili he
 The amount of water in its middle is much higher than the edges
 khaas baat yah he ki sarhind main sataha par aisa koi sanket nahin miltaa jisase andaja lag sake ki jameen ke neeche itani badi nadi ghati maujuud he
 Rather, there is a very hard surface just below the ground
 pani kii itani badi maatra sahaayak nadi main nahin balki mukhya nadi main ho sakati he
 Sinha said, "finger printing of pebbles found in the underground river valley shows that this river originated from the high Himalayas
 koi 1,000 kimi
 Used to travel in the Arabian Sea
 iske bahaav kii tulana vartmaan main ganga nadi se kii ja sakati he
 This evidence of Sirhind confirmed Saraswati's independent presence beyond the Ghaggar
 is shodh main taiyaar nakshe ke mutabik, saraswati kii seemaa sutluj ko chooti he
 That is, for the first time, the geophysical evidence was affixed to what Oldham had thought about the relationship of Sutlej and Saraswati 120 years ago
 aakhir kaise sukhi saraswati?to phir ye nadiyaan alag kaise ho gayi? vilupt saraswati nadi kii ghati kaa pichley 20 saal se adhyayan kar rahe puraatatv shastri or elahabaad puraatatv sangrahalay ke nideshak rajesh purohit bataate hai, ''samay ke saath saraswati nadi ko pani dene vaale glacier suukh gaye
 In these circumstances either the river flow was over or the later rivers like Indus, Sutlej and Yamuna occupied the river's flow area
 is puri prakriya ke dauraan saraswati nadi kaa pani purv disha kii ore or sutluj nadi kaa pani pashchim disha kii ore khisakta chalaa gaya
 Later civilizations developed on the banks of the Ganges and its tributary Yamuna (formerly Chambal)
 pehle yamuna nadi nahin thi or chambal nadi hi baha karti thi
 But the new river Yamuna, near Ponta Sahib in Himachal Pradesh, during the period of turbulence, captured the water source of Saraswati and later on it also got Chambal
 ”yani saraswati kii sahaayak nadi sutluj uskaa saath chhodkar pashchim main khiskkar sindhu main mil gari or purv main saraswati or chambal kii ghati main yamuna kaa udai ho gaya
 In such a situation, it is emphasized that even though there is no geophysical evidence of the confluence of ganga-yamuna-saraswati in Prayag, the evidence of Yamuna's occupation of Saraswati on the waterway indicates different relationship of these rivers
 udhar, jin mul raaston se hokar saraswati baha karti thi, uske bich main thar kaa marusthal aa gaya
 But the description of the old form of this river is found in the Rigveda
 rugveda ke shloke (7
 36
 6) main kaha gaya he, ''he saatvin nadi saraswati, jo sindhu or anya nadiyon kii mata he or bhoomi ko upjau banaati he, hamen ek saath prachur ann do or apane pani se sinchit karo
 "in the study of IIT Kanpur, some such old form of the river comes out
 sound racistivity par aadhaarit aankade bataate hai ki kalibanga or munak gaanv ke paas jameen ke neeche saaf pani se bhari nadi ghati kii jatil sanrachana maujuud he
 Studies conducted at both these places revealed that there is a sand base filled with fresh water more than 12 km wide and 30 meters thick within the ground
 jabaki maujuuda ghagghar nadi kii chaudaai mahaj 500 meter or gaharaai paanch meter hi he
 The freshwater-filled sand within the ground shows a complex structure, with many different streams joining a large river
 sinha ke shabdon main, ''yah jatil sanrachana aisi nadi ko dikhaati he jo aaj se kahin adhik barish or pani kii maujuudagi vaale kalkhand main astitv main thi yaa phir nadiyon ke pani kaa vibhaajan hone ke kaaran ab kahin or bahati he
 "the study further suggests that above this freshwater-filled sand is a layer of mud-filled sand
 is parat kii motaai kareeb 10 meter he
 This silt-laden layer points to the period when the river water dried up and the mud layer over it was deposited
 ye do paraten is baat kaa pramaan hai ki pracheen nadi bade aakaar main bahati thi or baad main suukh gai
 And much later after both these incidents, the Ghaggar-like rainy river came into existence
 saraswati se ganga ke tat par pahunchi sabhyataavaigyanik saakshyon kii shrinkhalaa yaheen nahin rukati
 Members of the same research team and Assistant Professor of Geology at Delhi University, Dr
 shashaank shekhar bataate hai, ''kalibanga main ghagghar nadi ke donon ore jis tarah ke mitti ke dhuh milte hai, us tarah ke dhuh kisi badi nadi kii ghati ke aasapaas hi ban sakate hai
 "and the way the remains of the Harappan period are found under the slopes of Kalibanga, this reinforces that there was a direct relationship between the Saraswati river and the Harappan culture
 kalibanga akelaa puraatatv sthal nahin he balki rajasthan ke hanumangarh or sriganganagar jilon main aise 12 bade dhuh chinhit kiye gaye hai
 The remains of the Harappan civilization have been found up to Gujarat in the west and Meerut in the east
 vahiin elahabaad ke paas kaushambi main hadappa sabhyataa kaa nayaa charan shuru hone ke puratathvik sakshya mili hai
 Analyzing these archaeological facts, the Director of Meerut Archaeological Museum, Dr
 manoj gautam kehete hai, ''ghagghar-hakara yaa vaidic saraswati ke tat par sirf purv hadappa kaal ke avshesh milte hai
 While the remains of former Harappan and New Harappan times have been found together near Kaushambi
 yah sandarbh saraswati nadi ke lupt hone or ganga-yamuna ke tat par nai sabhyataa ke viksit hone ke taur par dekhe ja sakate hai
 "the 4,000-year-old Pani IIT may have prepared a map of Saraswati with sound resistance in Punjab, Haryana and northern Rajasthan, but the rest of Rajasthan and Gujarat are waiting for their turn
" satellite image dikhaati he ki saraswati kii ghati haryana main kurukshetra, kaithal, fatehabad, sirsa, anupgarh, rajasthan main sriganganagar, hanumangarh, thar kaa marusthal or phir gujarat main khambhaat kii khadi tak jaati thi
 As the study progresses, there is a strong possibility of finding the remaining buried valley of the river
 rajasthan ke jaisalmer jile main bahut se aise borwell hai, jinase kai saal se apane aap pani nikal rahaa he
 These borewells were dug in 1998 to explore the underground river under the Mission Saraswati Scheme
 is dauraan kendriya bhoojal board ne kishangarh se lekar ghotaaru tak 80 kimi ke kshetra main 9 nalakup or rajasthan bhoojal vibhaag ne 8 nalakup khudwaaye
 Water has been flowing automatically from the tubewell of Gomti Devi in jaluwala village of the district for the last two years

 In the same way, continuous water is flowing from the tubewell of Arshad

 Inkhia says that whether it is Saraswati water or not, it can only be said after investigation
 lekin nalkupon se nikle pani ko bhabha atomic research centre ne 3,000 se 4,000 saal purana mana tha
 However, the IIT census is yet to be done
 yani aane vaale dinon main kuch or romaanchak jaankariyaan mil sakati hai
 Save the archaeological evidence and the historical, archaeological and geographical facts revolving around them are testimony to the lost Saraswati
 haalanki vigyaan aasthaa se ek baat main sahamat nahin he or is asahmati ke bahut gambhir myne bhi hai
 It is believed that Saraswati is disappearing and flowing into the ground, while IIT research says that the river is not flowing, but there is a large reservoir of water in its underground valley
 pro
 Sinha warns that if the water is continuously drained from the lost river valley through a large number of borewells, then the Paithi river in Patala will dry up forever, as there is no supply of new water in it
 ve saraswati kii sahi-sahi paimaaish isiilie kar rahe hai, taaki yah bataaya ja sake ki koun-sa pani saamaanya bhoojal he or koun sa saraswati kaa sangrakshit jal
 Scientists want that the water of the frozen river in the Hades is not used inappropriately because if this was done, then the Saraswati which had disappeared from the surface some 4,000 years ago, would also disappear from the Hades

 Where there are no thieves, even where they are not corrupt, only the rule of 'aap' runs

 Read the full report of what happened when the fire broke out in the Mumbai Ministry building
 
 
 mumbai ke mantralay main lagi aag abhi bhi puri tarah se buji nahin he
 But the fire brigade has heard the good news that the fire is under control
 lekin is aag main chaar pulisavaalon samet 6 log jakhmi hue hai
 The condition of one of them is said to be critical
 aag kii lapaton ko dekhakar andaja lagaana mushkil nahin tha ki aag kitni bheeshan lagi thi
 The sky was filled with black smoke and flames were constantly coming out of the building
 aag mumbai ke sabase taqatvar imaarat main lagi
 Powerful because there is an office of all ministers and secretaries from the CM of the state
 dopaher 02
 Two o'clock at half past two, fifty minutes into the Tribal Ministry on the third floor of Mumbai's ministry
 lekin isse pehle ki maamle kii gambhirtha koi samaj paata aag vikaraal ho uthi or teesri-paanchavin, chhathi manzil se neeche utarane kaa rasta band ho chukaa tha
 03 in the afternoon
 05 bajeag lagane ke pandrah minute ke andar fire brigade kii gadiyon kaa syran gunjane laga or aag bujhane ke liye fire brigade kii gadiyon ke saath-saath jawan bhi tainaat ho gaye
 Let us tell you that in the same building, Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan has an office on the sixth floor and he got caught in it if there was a fire
 fire brigade ne rassiyon ke sahare rescue oparation shuru kiya or logon ko building se nikaala jane laga
 While this was still going on, the work of extinguishing the fire
 dopaher 04
 At 00 o'clock, despite the fire brigade's efforts for an hour, the fire did not come under control and the fourth-fifth floor was also set on fire by the third floor fire
 adivasee vikaas mantri baban raav pachpute ke mutabik teesri manzil par aag bhadakte hi airkandishnar main blast shuru ho gaya
 He ran away from his office
 apane sahyogi cabinet mantri jayant patil ko teesri manzil se saath main liya or building se baahar nikal aae
 But within twenty minutes most of the ministry was engulfed by flames
 shaq tha ki aag se bachane ke liye kuch log chat par chhipe ho sakate hai
 04 Evening 56 bajeakhir aag lagane ke kareeb ek ghante se zyada vakt biit jane ke baad mantralay bhawan par navy kaa helicopter mandaraane laga
 The soldiers took stock of the ministry on the roof
 lekin shukr tha ki koi insaan chat par nahin fansaa tha
 While on the spot, Marcos and Rapid Action Force were also called for rescue
 shaam 06
 00 pm Three hours after the fire, the fire brigade was relieved
 teesri, chauthi, paanchavi manzil par aag par kuch had tak kaabo paa liya gaya
 Night 10
 00 bajemumbai ke mantralay kii imaarat main lagi aag main chhathi manzil se 2 shav mili

 The glory of Hartalika Teej 2019 has been considered incomparable
 hindu dharm main visheshkar suhaagin mahilaon ke liye is parv kaa mahatmaya bahut zyada he
 Like Hariyali Teej and Kajari Teej, gauri-shankar is worshiped on the day of Hartalika Teej
 haratalika teej kaa vrath behad kathin he
 On this day, women fast for more than 24 hours
 yahi nahin raat ke samay mahilaayein jaagran karti hai or agle din subah vidhivatt puja-paath karne ke baad hi vrath kholti hai
 It is believed that fasting of Haratalika Teej gives long life to the husband of a Suhagin woman whereas virgin girls get the desired groom
 yah tyohaar mukhya rup se bihar, uttar pradesh, rajasthan or madhya pradesh main manaaya jaataa he
 In Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, this fast is known as "gowri Habba"
 kuch jaankaron kaa kahana he ki haratalika teej kaa vrath 1 sitambar ko hi rakhaa janaa chahie kyonki tab din bhar tritiya rahegi
 The reasoning is also that the fast of Teerthalika Teej is observed in the Hasta Nakshatra, which is on 1 September
 vahiin kuch kaa maananaa he ki haratalika teej kaa vrath 1 sitambar kii bajaae 2 sitambar ko rakhaa janaa chahie
 They believe that Tritiya with Chaturthi is considered extremely fortunate
 aise main 2 sitambar ko tritiya kaa purna maan, hast nakshatra kaa udayatithi yoga or siankal chaturthi tithi kii purnataa teej parv ke liye sabase upyukt he
 In our opinion, you should first confirm the date of the Hatalika Teej with your Panditji or Jyotishi and fast according to it
 If you are fasting on September 02, then worship Teej within two hours after sunrise
 is din puja kaa shubh muhoort suryoday se subah 08 bajkar 58 minute tak he
 Suhaag Ingredients of Maa Parvati: Mehndi, Bangle, Bichhiya, Kajal, Bindi, Kumkum, Sindoor, Comb, Mahore, Suhag Pitari
 phir mata parvati ke paas jaakar naarad ji ne soochna di ki aapke pita ne aapkaa vivaah bhagwaan vishnu se tay kar diya he
 Hearing this, Parvati was very disappointed and requested her friends to take her to a secluded secret place
 mata parvati kii icchaanusaar unke pita maharaj himalay kii najaron se bachaakar unki sakhiyaan mata parvati ko ghaney sunsaan jangal main sthit ek gupha main chhod ain
 Staying here, he started a rigorous tenacity to get Lord Shiva in the form of a husband, for which he established a Shivling of sand
 sanyog se hast nakshatra main bhadrapada shukla tritiya kaa vah din tha jab mata parvati ne shivlinga kii sthapana kii
 On this day, while fasting, they also performed awakening at night
 unke kathor tap se bhagwaan shiv prasann hue mata parvati ji ko unki manokamana purna hone kaa vardaan diya
 The next day, Mata Parvati, with her sakhi, passed the fast and made all the worship material flow into the river Ganges
 udhar, mata parvati ke pita bhagwaan vishnu ko apni beti se vivaah karne kaa vachan die jane ke baad putree ke ghar chhod dene se vyakul the
 Then he reached the place looking for Parvati
 iske baad mata parvati ne unhen apane ghar chhod dene kaa kaaran bataaya or bhagwaan shiv se vivaah karne ke apane sankalp or shiv dwaara mili vardaan ke bare main bataaya
 Then Father Maharaj Himalaya, apologizing to Lord Vishnu, agreed to marry his daughter to Lord Shiva

 On the formation of the NCTC, Manmohan Singh said, “it is not our government's intention to affect the distribution of rights between states and the central government in any way
 " Addressing the day-long meeting, the Prime Minister said that the establishment of NCTC "is not a state versus center issue" as the primary objective is to coordinate counter-terrorism efforts in this vast country
 chidambaram ne bhi ensitisi kaa jamkar bachaav kiya or kaha ki sanstha desh kii suraksha adhosanrachana kaa ek mahatvapurn stambh hogi
 But Mamata Banerjee and the Chief Ministers of other states, could not be satisfied with these things of Manmohan and Chidambaram
 unhone kaha ki ensitisi ko kisi bhi haal main gathit nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Jayalalithaa accused the Union Home Ministry of degrading the state governments and said that they are being treated as pawns on chess board
 aatankwaad nirodhak kshamtaaon main kamiyon va jaruraton ko puraa nahin kiya ja rahaa he

 saath hi main us vakt bahut chota tha
 I'm joking jo baat main kahana chahta hum vah yah he ki ab main pehle se zyada paripakv hum

 If someone narrates the story of the film, i still fall asleep so that's why i like to read scripts
 sawaal:ek lead actor hone ke naate kya aapke upar aisi film kaa hissaa banane kaa dabaav he jo 100 karod kaa kaarobaar kare?jawaab:dabaav to nahin he, lekin ek seleble actor hona acchhee baat he jo badi hit filmon main bhi kaam karata he

 But i think whatever i got for the National Award or Padma Shri, i want to earn it over time where i look back and say yes, now it is an incomparable contribution towards cinema
 lekin mujhe lagata he ki din-ba-din meraa kaam acha hota ja rahaa he
 Question: It seems that your daughter Sara is also going to become an actor

 com chilchilaati garmi se raahat dete hue dakshin-pashchim monsoon ne aakhirkaar shuukravaar ko odisha ke tat par dastak di
 Since then, it started raining in different parts of the state
 bhartiya mausam vibhaag (iemdi) ke varisht vaigyanik mrityunjay mahapatra ne kaha ki monsoon agle teen dinon main odisha main aage badhegaa
 Mahapatra, who will take over as the Director General of the Indian Meteorological Department on August 1, said that the entire state would experience rains in the next 72 hours
 unhone yah bhi bhavishyavaanee kii ki bodh, gajpati, ganjam, kalahandi or kandhamal jaise jilon main shuukravaar se barish shuru ho sakati he
 # Monsoonhas reached more parts of South Madhya Pradesh # Maharashtra, most parts of # Karnataka, rest of # tamilnadu, entire # andhrapradesh, most parts of # Telangana, parts of South # Chhattisgarh & # Odisha, most parts of # westbengal, parts of # Jharkhand , # Bihar

 Vishwas said the monsoon has entered Odisha on Friday and has covered 16 districts, including all 11 coastal districts and five interior districts
 baaki ke jilon main agle 48 se 72 ghanton main iske pahunchane kii sambhaavna he
 On the other hand, the weather in Hyderabad has also turned good yahaan par bhi shuukravaar ko barish hui, jiske baad paara gir gaya
 Meteorological experts say that the monsoon started in Anantapur and Rayalaseema district of Chittoor district on Friday and it will spread across the state by tomorrow
 redurgam, roddam, anantpur jile ke tanakal or chitoor jilon main bhi barish darj kii gai
 After the arrival of monsoon in Andhra Pradesh, the temperature dropped on Friday
 lalit modi sahi he yaa galat? vah dusht bhagoda he yaa phir kisi kii parvaah na karne vaala hvicilabloar? yah shaks ek maanav bam he yaa phir ek yoddha? in sawaalon ko dohraane kaa ab koi matlab nahin he
 These questions have been debated for two weeks and the answers have not been received
 unke jitne bhi daawey, khulaase or aarope hai, saath hi india today samooh se do baar baatcheet he, unase bas ek baat sabit hoti he ki upar di gai tamaam sangyaaon kaa kuch ansh unke bheetar jarur he
 That is why it would be better to ask this question, what is better? To be friends or enemies in the eyes of Lalit (first name so that he can be separated from the Prime Minister, not because we are friends)? Or if you ask, what would be worse in both? Try asking this question to both of their friends, Sushma Swaraj and Vasundhara Raje, who are considered to be top leaders of BJP and were also considered contenders for the big post in future
 
 ab ve bachengi yaa nahin, is sawaal se itar ek baat to sach he ki lalit ke saath dosti ne unhen sthaayee nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 You can also ask this question to the enemies of Lalit, whether they are from the cricket world (arun Jaitley, Rajiv Shukla, N
 shrinivasana) yaa phir raajnneeti se (pranab mukherjee, unki vishwast sahyogi omita paul or yahaan tak gandhi parivaar bhi)
 His media enemies can also be asked this question, especially from Vineet Jain of the Times Group and Prime Time Judge and Magistrate Arnab Goswami
 lalit aag ugal rahe hai or har koi jhulasa ja rahaa he, alabatta tivi ke parade par hi sahi
 You can be sure that everyone, Raje and Swaraj too, will be cursing them
 doston ne chhod diya, dushman kos rahe hai
 Despite this, Lalit during his 15-day fame has undoubtedly fulfilled an ambition that i think was smoldering in the corner of his heart: this ambition is to be more famous than the cricketers whom he started by IPL Have made it so rich
 unhone doston or dushmano ko ek saath nuksaan sirf isliye nahin pahunchaaya he kyonki ve murkh hai
 They are not suicidal at all
 iske teen kaaran hai
 Firstly, they do not understand the politics of India at all and do not even care about it
 duusare, unke saare faisle unke ahan se paidaa hote hai
 The third and most important reason is something that they cannot do anything about? It is BCCI, a JB company of Indian cricket shareholders
 agar main puraani dhara kaa patrkaar hone kii bajaae ek aadhunik tippaneekar hota to main chahta ki is company par mafia kaa kabja ho
 This is not because this institution is a group of criminals, thugs or gangsters
 isane vastav main bhartiya or vishwa cricket kaa kaaphi bhala kiya he
 i am just taking a lesson from the much more infamous version of FIFA, where the mafia reigns: especially the episode of Omerta reminds us that any rebel here is brutally eliminated
 yah kaliyug kaa ek chakravyuuh he
 It is difficult to break it
 agar tod bhi diya to surakshit nikal aana naammumkin he, basharte lalit khud ko iskaa apwaad sabit kar den
 The politics of BCCI is far more complex, or easier to say
 yah is par nirbhar karata he ki aap kis kone se use dekh rahe hai
 What makes it so complex is the quality of Indian politics, where only factional politics is effective

 My friend and The Economist's former bureau chief in India, James Estill, conducted a dialogue session with Arun Jaitley and Rajiv Shukla at the British Council in Delhi on the launch of his brilliant book The Great Tamasha: Cricket, Corruption and the Turbulent Rise of Modern India Invited for shrotaaon kii dilchaspee jagaane ke liye mujhe raajnneeti se behatar mudda nahin mila
 This is before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, so i said that i will not do the foolishness of giving any decision about the result of the election, but i can definitely say that if NDA wins, Rajiv Shukla will be the head of IPL
 
 congress jiti to arun jetali is pad par aaenge
 Everyone laughed and no one from Shukla or Jaitley made any comment
 cricket main aa rahi rajnatik takat uske liye bahut laabhakaari rahi he
 As far as money is concerned, enough money started coming into cricket long before IPL
 yah iklauta khel he jiske saamne koi sarkari chunauti nahin khadi ho paati, chaahe vija kaa maamla ho, manzooriyon kaa, stadimon ke liye bhoomi aavanton kaa yaa phir pulisia intjaam kaa masalaa (sivaae ek baar ke jab 2009 main bataur grih mantri pi
 Chidambaram had shown IPL the way to South Africa as it was getting on with the general election)
 yahaan tak ki prasarakon ke upkarnon ko dhokar le jane ke liye bhartiya vaayu sena ke chartered vimaan yaa gharelu vanijyik udaanon kii bhi vyavastha ho jaati he
 Whether they have to change their time or add extra flights
 cricket bharat main ek aisa khel ban gaya he jisamen is khel par kabja rakhane vaale logon ne apane naam se stadium banavaa die hai or ve bhi apane jite ji (vankhede, di

 Before the eyes of the political leaders were the nobles and royalists who used to play cricket, who used to love this game
 inamen rajsingh duungarpur aakhri shaks the kyonki sindhiya gharaane ko ham shahi nahin, rajnatik kunba maanate hai
 Then came the era of chartered accountants, among whom Jagmohan Dalmiya and Shashank Manohar were among the last to rule the BCCI
 donon ab bhi maujuud hai or daalamia ko to punerjeevan bhi mil gaya he, kyonki unhone usee shaasha tabake ke saath samjhauta kar liya jiske khilaaf lalit aaj lard rahe hai or jisane kabhi unhen barbaad kar daalaa tha or yahaan tak ki unke khilaaf gaban kaa aapraadhik mukadmaa bhi darj karvaa diya tha
 a few bureaucrats also came and were shown the way out

 In this changing picture of the politics of cricket, another interesting group followed
 kuch majhole aakaar ke lekin paryaapt paise vaale korporate khel se prem or glamer kii chaah main bheetar ghuse
 The most important of these were Srinivasan and Lalit
 donon ko rayeesi viraasat main mili thi lekin donon hi puraane kism ke kaarobaaron se jude the- cement or cigarette
 Most interestingly, there was a confrontation (manohar and Dalmia) between the first cas
 uske baad kaarobaariyon main jhagada hua (lalit or shrinivasana)
 The political component that remained during this period remained undisturbed and the party he supported both times won
 lalit isi sachaai ko sweekaar karne se munh chura rahe hai ki bisisiai ke bheetar saare rajaneta ek saath ek swar main khadey rahete hai or hameshaa jitate hai
 How much do i know Lalit? Not much, except that i once had an on-camera conversation at Ferozeshah Kotla when he was shining with ipl's first success
 maine unka parichay bhartiya khelon ke jeri magwair (ek america khel agent jiskaa kirdaar tom krooj ne nibhaayaa tha) ke taur par karavaaya tha, jis par ve kaaphi fida ho gaye the
 In that conversation, he had explained how, after sitting on his laptop for hours, he prepared the IPL blueprint and made this miracle come true
 kya main unase landan main mila hum? beshak, vahiin jahaan koi bhartiya achaanak mil jaataa he- taj samooh ke saint james court main
 They were having lunch with Bindra and i felt that neither of them were very happy to find me there
 ipiel kii kamyaabi or bisisiai kii takat unke sir chadhakar bolne lagi or ek vakt aisa aayaa jab unhone apni chadar se baahar pair failaa die
 He had tasted this global strength only when he was first sent by the BCCI to play a deal with the Australian players to play in the IPL
 unke prabhaav va cricketron or australian board (khiladinnon kii fees kaa ansh) ko unke die paison ke lobh ne baad main australia main hi harbhajan singh-andrew symonds ke “mankigate” vaale vivaad ko sulajhane main madad kii
 His aggressive, naked display of airs and BCCI prowess tilted Palra into India's favor, with one umpire (steve Buckner) suspended while Bhajji was cheaply missed
 takat kaa yahi nasha swechhachaar main badal gaya jab 2009 main ve upie sarkaar ko thenga dikhaate hue sharad pavaar or rajeev shukla kii mileebhagat se ipiel ko dakshin africa main lekar chale gaye
 Lalit was the biggest star of that IPL
 unki is nai prasiddhi kaa gavaah main daavos main bana jab mujhase kai inch lambii miss south africa ne mere naam ke bille ko dekhakar poocha ki aap bharat se hai, to kya lalit ko jaanate hai? yah dakshin africa main 2009 ke ipiel ke turant baad kii baat he
 After this, Lalit's downfall started and Srinivasan's star started shining
 lalit apane andaaj main jitne bhadkile the, shrinivasana utane hi shant, lekin netaaon se nipatane ke maamle main ve kahin zyada chatur the sivaay ek ke- khud apane rajya main jayalalita se
 Lalit's bold and nonchalant style helped him further as both friends and enemies started burning with him
 pavaar jo ab tak unke dost bane hue the, ve bhi lalit kii madad nahin kar paae
 Whatever be the case of the Enforcement Directorate against him, but today all the forces against Lalit are one
 ve modi kaa gungan bhale kar len, raaje or swaraj ko shukriya bhale kah den, lekin ye sab unase duuri hi baratenge
 Narendra Modi's government has repeatedly called him a fugitive (which he is not) and blamed the UPA government for his "escape"
 ho saktaa he ki sarkaar aapraadhik len-dein vaale kanoonon ke sahare british sarkaar par unka pratyrpan karne kaa dabaav daale
 Lalit's misfortune is that the whole politics will remain united against him
 ek puraani kahawat he ki sirf cricket or jang ke vakt bhartiya ek hote hai
 The new version of this is that all the Indian politicians are united in the war over the power of cricket
 Had a great Tabla Session with My Nephew Sparsh Sangam!! We just love n live music # music # classical music # tablaa post shared by Yo Yo Honey Singh (@yyhsofficial) on Apr 9, 2018 at 9:17am PDTA post shared by Yo Yo Honey Singh (@yyhsofficial) on Mar 15, 2018 at 2:59am PDT Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) party is getting majority in almost all opinion polls in Delhi assembly elections
 sirf india tivi-sivotor kaa opinian pole bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ko bahumat de rahaa he
 According to Opinion Polls of India Today Group and Cicero, the AAP appears to be winning a clear majority, winning 38 to 46 seats
 vahiin bijepi ko sirf 19 se 25 siten milti najar aa rahi hai
 At the same time, according to the survey of India tv-cvoter, BJP can get 37 seats, AAP 28 and Congress 5 seats
 haalanki abeepi news-nilsan ke mutabik, AAP ko 35, bijepi ko 29 or congress ko 6 siten mil sakati hai
 In the Opinion Poll of ht-seafour, AAP has been given 36-41 seats, BJP 27-32 and Congress 2 to 7 seats
 vahiin iti-tnes ke mutabik, AAP ko 36-40, bijepi ko 28-32 or congress ko 2 se 4 siten mil sakati hai
 Does democracy rest on the vote? Does the EVM go on and the Opposition is beginning to realize that the threat from voting on evms is a threat to democracy
 isliye 10 april ko chunaav ayog main to 12 april ko raashtrapati ke daravaaje par congress samet 13 raajnneetik dalon ne ye kahkar dastak di ki voting phir se ballat papper par honi chahie kyonki unhen iviem par bharosa nahin he
 The big question is whether through evms there is a threat to democracy itself, or after the defeat, the opposition has started thinking that the evms should not be trusted only by keeping the trust of the voters
 iviem ke khel se pehle jaraa desh main loktantr ke us mizaaj ko samajhnaa jaruri he jo iviem ke jariye hi sahi desh main raajnneetik numaayindagi karne vaale netaaon ke upar aati he, kyonki bharat duniya kaa sabase bada loktantric desh he or 2011 ke sensos ke mutabik alam ye he ki
 
 
 - An MP represents 22,20,538 people
 - bharat ke baad duniya ke sabase puraane loktantric desh america kaa number aata he
 - a sinter in the US represents 7,22,636 people
 agar loktantr ke is khel main duniya ke sabase zyada jansankhya vaale desh china kaa zikr kar len to aapako jaanakar hairat hogi ki
 
 
 - a member of the National People's Congress in China represents 4,48,518 people
 - china main neshnal pipuls congress ke 2987 sadsy hote hai jabaki bharat main sirf 545 saansad hote hai
 mps of India have more responsibility than any representation of the world, then the MP is also more powerful and the ruling party also has the most power
 jab loktantr kii ye puri prakriya hi voting par tiki he or voting kaa tarika iviem mashin he
 Questions are being raised on the same even if the issue is only about technology or democracy, a new debate has started about it
 chunki bahes ke kendra main kahin naa kahin upi chunaav parinaam he or upi desh kaa naa sirf sabase bada suba he balki upi ke chunavi loktantr kaa sach ye bhi he ki
 
 
 - An MLA represents about 5 lakh people in UP
 - upi dharm-jati kii raajnneetik prayogshaala ke taur par dekha jaataa he
 - The socio-economic definition of UP also changes from West to East
 aise main bijepi kii banpar jeet ko haare hue tamaam raajnneetik dal pachaane kii sthiti main nahin hai or sari bahes isi par aa tiki he ki iviem ke bharose vot ke loktantr ko choda nahin ja saktaa
 In fact, the opposition has sharpened the allegations of tampering with the electronic voting machine
 lekin in tikhe tewaron ke bich chunaav ayog ne bhi ye kahkar chunauti de di ki
 
 
 - In May, representatives of all political parties will be called, and will be asked to prove their allegations
 - bangalore or hyderabad, jahaan iviem banati hai, vahaan se technical export kii team bhi aegi
 - Any private person claiming to hack evms can also register for the program
 yani chunaav ayog har aarope ko sabit karne kii chunauti de rahaa he
 At the same time, the entire opposition came knocking on the President's door today and said in one voice - tampering of evms has questioned the sanctity of the entire electoral process, and it is a threat to democracy
 lekin sach yah bhi he ki jis congress kii aguwai main vipaksh raashtrapati se milane pahunchaa
 The same Congress leader and former law minister Veerappa Moily has pushed the Congress on the backfoot, saying that evms are unlikely to go wrong and that all parties, including the Congress, are looking for excuses to be defeated through allegations of malpractices
 haalanki sawaal kisi ke bayaan yaa aarope kaa nahin-sawaal iviem kii vishwasaneeyata kaa he, kyonki puraa chunavi loktantr hi ab iviem par aa tikaa he
 Obviously, the big responsibility is on the Election Commission and so next month from the political parties to the hackers, the Election Commission is challenging to prove it
 bharat ne china kii companiyon ko nivesh ke liye aamantrit karte hue kaha he ki chini companiyon ke liye vahaan soochna praudyogiki, abhiyantriki or usase sambandhit kshetron main nivesh kii badi sambhaavnaaen hai

 lekin prashasan or nagar palika ne sanyukt rup se buldozer chalava kar 17 disambar ko dhaah diya
 At the time when the bulldozer was running on Munshi ji's house, many people who pretended to be the watchdogs of the society and responsible officials remained tamashabin

 shaharon main gaay, bail or sand durghatana kii sabase badi vajah hai, to hai ve par laavaaris vichar rahe ye pashu har din darjanon durghatana kii vajah ban rahe hai
 New order of the Yogi government: The new figures of the accident have made it difficult for the government, then the Yogi government has come up with a new order that now the government will open the galleries in all the town panchayats and big panchayats and committees of people headed by DM in the cities Will run ye to hui planning kii baat, lekin jab tak itane bade str par goshaalaayein nahin ban jaati tab tak kya durghatnaayen hoti rahengi
 Will people keep losing their loved ones? This question is becoming increasingly big
 dudharu gaay to log paalate hai, lekin doodh sookhte hi ye gaayen laavaaris sadakon par chhod di jaati hai
 Worse is the condition of bulls, calves and sars who are now roaming in every street, squares and streets as a disaster for the people

 Not only the city, but also on the expressway like lucknow-agra, there has been a lot of increase in accidents due to lavish cow dynasty
 har nagar panchayat main goshaaline mauton kaa aankada hi he ki ab yogi sarkaar ne in gaayon ko rakhane or durghatana se bachaane ke liye har nagar panchayat main gaushala kholane or har bade panchayat main kancreet ke shed main goshaala banane kaa faisla liya he
 The Chief Minister is now raising the issue of leaving abandoned cows on the road in every speech

 Special Campaign on the orders of CM The Principal Secretary has ordered all the municipal corporations to run a special campaign from 5th to 15th
 is abhiyaan ke antargat sadak par ghoomane vaali aawaara gaayon ko pakad kar goshaala pahunchaaya jayega, jisase unki sahi tareeke se dekharekh ho sake
 Often, the locals extract the milk of their cows and leave them on the streets to graze, where these cows feast on accidents
 yogi sarkaarne aise logon ke liye jaruri disha-nirdesh jari kiye hai
 The government has imposed penalty rules against such people, so that people do not leave their pets on the streets
 sarkaar ke paas sthai samaadhaan nahinchaahe varanasi ho yaa saharanpur kai jilon main in dinon laavarish gaayon ko pakadaney kaa abhiyaan chal rahaa he, lekin in laavarish gaayon ko rakhane kaa koi sthaayee samaadhaan philhal sarkaar ke paas nahin he
 The municipal corporation catches them, but they have to leave again because neither they have so much space nor so much fodder

 Angered by his candidature from Begusarai, Giriraj Singh is constantly making statements in the media that his ticket to be transferred to Begusarai from Nawata seat is tantamount to his self-respect
 iske liye giriraaj singh bijepi netritv ko hi jimmedaar maan rahe hai
 If sources are to be believed, Giriraj Singh wants to talk to the central leadership on this subject and he wants to somehow fight him again from the Nawada seat
 yahi vajah he ki unhone ab tak begusarai se chunavi taiyaariyaan bhi nahin shuru kii he
 However, the news is also that the seats that BJP has decided, it is not going to back down and now BJP is not even trying to convince Giriraj Singh
 yani ab begusarai se hi giriraaj singh ko ladanaa hoga

 com / ohwjuyl6gv There has always been a lot of care about what to eat and not during pregnancy
 is samay sharir main kai tarah ke badlaav hote hai isliye sabase zyada khanpan kaa dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he
 During this time eating papaya is strictly prohibited, it is believed that eating it can lead to miscarriage and it is considered harmful for the fetus
 garm taasir ke kaaran hota he hanikaarakahalanki is baat ko lekarvaigyanikon or doctoronki alag-alag raay he
 Actually, papaya is warm in nature and is also used to clean the stomach in the case of stomach diseases or constipation
 isi ke chalate yah mana jaataa he, ki garm taasir hone ke kaaran yah garbhasth shishu ko nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 Ripe papaya is beneficial
 Experts say that papaya can be eaten during pregnancy if it is fully cooked and should be used in small quantities
 puri tarah se pakaa hua papeeta vitamin-si or vitamin-i kaa strot hota he or isamen fibre ke saath hi folic acid bhi bharpoor maatra main paaya jaataa he jo phydemand he
 a drink made by mixing papaya with milk and honey, is very nutritious, which is considered very healthy for pregnant and lactating women
 kaccha papeeta hota he hanikaarakapapita agar puri tarah se pakaa hua nahin he, jaraa bhi kaccha he to yah bahut hanikaarak hota he
 Half ripe papaya is not safe at all
 ek shodh ke anusaar, kachche yaa aadhe pake hue papite main letex kii adhikta hoti he
 This latex may be responsible for uterine contractions
 saath hi papite ke chhilake or beej bhi garbhavastha main behad hanikaarak ho sakate hai
 Despite all these, it is generally recognized about papaya, that its intake in pregnancy is completely harmful
 garbhavastha main papite ke seven ko lekar alag-alag mat hai lekin is samay papite kaa seven karne se purv apane doctor se avashya sampark karen

 iske baad chah sadasyeey tamil neshnal alliance party, jiskaa pichley saal agast main uttari prantiy parishad par niyantran tha, ke daure ke samay bhi yahi maang kii gai
 Smriti Patnaik of the New Delhi-based Institute of Defense Studies and Analysis says, "the Chinese card was to be played again as a response to Rajapaksa
 ” chini raashtrapati shi jinping ke colombo daure or pichley saal aktubar main nai dilli daure ke samay jab duusari baar chini pandubbiyon ko lungar daalane kii ijaajat di gai to south block main vyakulata paidaa ho gai
 Sri Lanka's opposition began to be supported by India
 baharhaal, nai dilli ne 8 janvari ke chunaav main saarvajanik rup se khud ko nishpaksh dikhaane kii koshish kii
 The next day, soon after the historic victory in the election, Modi sent an invitation to President Maithripal Sirisena to come to India, which was a clear indication of the opportunity to reinvigorate the relations that had deteriorated under Rajapaksa's rule
 sirisena “china, bharat, pakistan or japan ke saath samaan sambandhon” kaa vaada kar chuke hai
 This clearly shows that they now want to balance the earlier trend towards China
 lekin nai dilli kii chintaaon ko dur karne ke maamle main un par baari dabaav rahegaa, jaise yuddh se behaal uttari or purvi ilaakon ke tamilon ko srilanka kii mukhyadhara main shaamil karnaa
 Sri Lanka held the first election of the Provincial Council in the northern areas in 25 years, but was not given any rights in terms of police and land, leaving their status as municipalities
 bharat ne 2012 or 2013 main america samarthit yuan maanavadhikaar parishad ke prastaavon par srilanka ke khilaaf vot diya
 Hardeep Singh Puri, former representative of India at the UN, says, "the Sirisena government should be given some time to work on a policy of taking all communities together and to fulfill its promise to make Sri Lanka a democratic and multi-ethnic society
" ” nai dilli ko ummid he ki srilanka ab china ko zyada ranneetik phayda nahin degaa
 Before the Lok Sabha elections 2019, all the opposition parties tried to unite against PM Modi and in view of the possible defeat of the NDA, many leaders and parties who were with the BJP in the year of 2014, took turns on some pretext before the elections
 ab loksabhaa chunaav khatm hone ke baad aaj tak-exis maai india agsit pole ke jo aankade saamne aae hai usko dekhakar lagata he ki endie se alag hue dalon ko iskaa baari nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he or pradhanmantri narendra modi 2014 ke mukaable se bhi badi jeet darj kar dobaaraa satta main vaapasi kar sakate hai
 According to the aaj-axis My India exit poll, the NDA is projected to get 339 to 365 seats out of 542 seats in this Lok Sabha election and the BJP is likely to get a majority on its own
 aaj tak ke is sabase bade survey main 742,187 pratibhaagiyon ne hissaa liya tha jinaki raay par yah aankada saamne aayaa he
 Chandrababu Naidu will have to face separation from the NDA
 If the figures of the exit poll have come out, if they turn into a result, then those parties will definitely have to bear the loss, which will leave the NDA with the other parties just before the election
 Allied or became the face of opposition
 endie kaa saath chhodane vaale netaa or dalon kii baat karen to isamen sabase aage telugu desham party (tidipi) ke adhyaksh or andhra pradesh ke siem chandrababu naidu kaa naam aata he
 The TDP parted ways with the NDA after Andhra Pradesh was denied special state status and Chandrababu Naidu became the main face of Modi's opposition
 unhone kai rajyon main gum kar kshetreey dalon ko bijepi or narendra modi ke khilaaf ekajute karne kii koshish kii or endie sarkaar par pakshpaat karne tak ke aarope lagaae
 When TDP was part of NDA alliance in the last Lok Sabha elections, Chandra Babu Naidu's party got 16 seats at that time, but according to exit poll figures after this Lok Sabha election, TDP got only 4 to 6 seats
 It is estimated only
 itnaa hi nahin loksabhaa chunaav ke saath hi rajya main hue vidhansabha chunaav ke jo aankade agsit pole main aae hai usase aisa lag rahaa he ki rajya kii satta se bhi chandrababu kii vidaai ho sakati he
 According to Aaj Tak- Axis My India exit poll, YSR Congress is getting 119-135 seats out of 175 assembly seats in Andhra Pradesh
 jabaki chandrababu naidu kii party tidipi ko 39-51 siten mil rahi hai
 Apart from this, Pawan Kalyan's party JSP is likely to get 1-3 seats and others 2 seats
 kushvaha or maanjhi ko bhi endie se alag hona pad saktaa he mahangaloksabhaa chunaav 2019 main is baar bihar ke sameekaran hi badal gaye
 In the last election, the enemies who were friends became friends and those who were friends changed their hearts and joined the ranks of the enemy
 ham baat kar rahe hai bihar kii sattadhari party jediu, upendra kushvaha kii rashtriya loksamata party or purv siem jithan ram maanjhi ke 'ham' kii
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, where JDU contested against BJP and could win only two seats, this time till date - Axis My India exit poll figures have revealed that JDU won 12 out of 17 seats
 Is seen doing
 vahiin chunaav se thik pehle kushvaha ne manmutabik siten nahin milane par endie chhodkar tejasvi yadav ke netritv vaale mahagathbandhan kaa daaman tham liya tha
 Now according to the exit poll data, it can be difficult to open Upendra Kushwaha's account
 aise hi haalat jithan ram maanjhi kii party kii bhi he or survey ke mutabik unke liye bhi kisi seat par jeet darj karnaa mushkil hai
 According to exit poll, NDA can win 38-40 seats in Bihar, while the Grand Alliance is expected to get 0-2 seats
 rajbhar kaa gaya mantri pad, chunaav jeetna bhi mushkilupi main bijepi kii sahyogi dal rahi suheldev bhartiya samaaj party ke mukhiya om prakaash rajbhar apni party ko endie kii taraf se upi main seat nahin milane par baagi ho gaye or loksabhaa chunaav se pehle khud ko endie se alag kar liya he
 However, he cited the reason for the Social Justice Committee report
 endie se alag hone ke baad mantri pad chhodane kaa bhi elaan kar diya
 However, soon after the exit poll figures came out, CM Yogi discharged him as a minister
 ajtak-exis maai india agsit pole ke aankadon ke mutabik upi main rajbhar kii party ko ek bhi seat milti nahin dikh rahi he
 The main contest is seen between the BJP and the Grand Alliance all over UP
 survey ke mutabik do siton par endie kii sahyogi apana dal ke ummidavaar aage chal rahe hai
 Please tell that Rajbhar's party Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party was associated with BJP before the 2017 assembly elections but Rajbhar did not leave any chance of attack on BJP
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se kareeb ek saal pehle hi shivasena ne bhi elaan kar diya tha ki wo aglaa chunaav (2019) akele ladenge lekin baad main phir bijepi se gathbandhan kar liya or maharashtra main endie ke binar tale hi chunaav lade
 In the same way, the leader of Lok Janshakti Party of Minister Ram Vilas Paswan and his son Chirag Paswan at the Center had indicated that if they did not get the seats they wanted, then the way for them to enter the grand alliance is open but later talk to BJP and His party contested under the NDA
 agsit pole ke aankade bataate hai ki is chunaav main in donon partiyon ko bhi iskaa phayda mil saktaa he

 supreme court main aaj elactoral bond ke jariye raajnneetik dalon ko milane vaale funding kii paardarshita par sunwaayee hogi
 The Central Government, while launching the electoral bonds, claimed that through this bond political funding would be reduced and black money received as political donations would be stopped, but this did not happen
 supreme court ne 12 march ko hui sunwaayee main centre sarkaar ko fatkaar lagaai thi
 The Supreme Court said that the central government has not made any permanent system on political funding
 supreme court ne centre ko naseehat bhi di thi ki is bare main centre sarkaar gambhirtha se kadam uthaae
 Since then, Electoral Bond has been under constant questioning
 darasal supreme court main maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan yah tathy saamne aayaa ki janpratinidhiyon ke or unke rishtedaaron kaa dhan paanch saal ke bheetar hi 500 fisadi tak bad gaya
 There is currently no restriction on political funding
 is tarah kii funding par roak lagane ke liye supreme court or dilli hai court main kai yachikaayen lambit hai
 The government introduced electoral bearer bonds to make funding for political parties transparent
 lekin raajnneetik dalon ko milane vaale chande kaa sorce pataa na hone ke chalate korporate chande ko aisa badhaava mila
 Also, money received from abroad also became legal
 association for democratic riforms (ADR) kii yachika ellection kamishan ke elactoral bond ke khilaaf daayar kii gai he
 Know the five reasons why objections to electoral bonds - sources are not necessary to mention
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley wrote in January 2018 that the scheme of electoral bonds to bring 'clean' money in the system of political funding and increase 'transparency' Has been brought isamen strot kaa khulaasa karnaa jaruri nahin bataaya tha
 Changes in the Finance Bill 2017 were brought about by some changes under the Electoral Bond Finance Act 2017
 in parivartanon se paardarshita ko bhi nuksaan pahunchaa he
 Changing section 29C of the Representation of the People Act (RP Act) said that funding from electoral bonds would be kept out of the purview of the Election Commission
 khud chunaav ayog ne in badlaavon par aapatti karte hue kanoon mantralay ko badlaav ke liye kaha tha
 The Election Commission had said that it is difficult to ascertain whether any political parties are receiving donations from a government foreign source
 -satta or vipakshi dalon ke chande main asantulanelectoral bond se vastav main satta paksh ko phayda ho rahaa he
 According to the ADR, in 2017-18, an amount of Rs 222 crore was donated by electoral bonds
 isamen se bijepi ko 210 karod (94
 5%), Congress got Rs 5 crore and the remaining parties got Rs 7 crore
 -KYC norm jarurielactoral bond ke jariye raajnneetik partiyon ko chanda dene vaale vyaktiyon kii paise dene waalon ke aadhaar or jan-dhan account kii detail mil jaaegi
 Contribution to the electoral bond will be made by 'payee check of a bank or electronic clearing system from a bank account'
 sarkaar ne janvari 2018 main elactoral bond ke notification jari karte samay yah bhi saaf kiya tha ki ise kharidne vaale ko puri tarah se no yor customers (kevaisi) norm puraa karnaa hoga or bank khate ke dwaara bhugtan karnaa hoga
 Shell companies to get boost The Company Act 2013 stated that a company will make 7 of its average net profit of last three years in a financial year
 5 fisadi se zyada kaa raajnneetik chanda nahin de sakati
 But the funding was made limitless, with provisions changing
 companiyon ko is baat se bhi chhot mili he ki ve apane bahikhaate main yah baat chupa len ki unhone kis party ko chanda diya he
 The Election Commission has objected to all these changes
 isse is baat kaa jokhim badha he ki sirf raajnneetik dalon ko chanda dene ke liye shell companiyon kaa gathan ho
