 court ne kaha ki hindu dharm main mahilaon or purushon main kisi tarah kaa bhedbhaav nahin hota

 i wish the university all the best
 iske paas bahut acchhee faikalti he or shandaar vaais chancelar hai
 i hope that someday Gandhi's soul will be revived in his own Gujarat or, to be precise, a biographer of Gandhi cannot teach on Gandhi in his own city
 ' The poems written to justify Gandhi's assassination are being chalked up on social media, are being spread, even those who garland the Godse statue have no problem but is it not sad that Gandhi's biographer has to remember Gandhi's Permission to teach a course on Gandhi was not given in the city

 Ramchandra Guha has been described in the letter as anti-india, anti-hindu culture, it is a tribute to the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad not to ask the Prime Minister and the President to expel him from the country

 Do you know that the Academic Affairs Standing Committee of the University of Delhi has ordered the removal of the term Dalit from the books read for the students of MA Political Science
 dalit kii jagah bahujan, ambedkarwaadi yaa anusuchit jati kaa istamaal hoga
 Not only this, the book of Kancha Ilaiah Shepherd has also been removed from the course of political science
 vir main manisha tiwari ne likhaa he ki standing cameti kii baithak main prastaav paas rakhaa gaya ki ilaiya kii kitaaben isliye hataai jaaen kyonki ve kathith taur par hindu dharm kaa apmaan karti hai
 On this news website, N
 Sukumar, who teaches in the Department of Political Science, University of Delhi, has put his side
 unka paksh yahi he ki jamaane tak polytical science vibhaag main manu, kautilya, tagore, gandhi saavarkar ko hi padhaayaa jaataa rahaa he
 But i created a new course called Dalit Bahujan Political Thought
 jisamen gautam buddha, jyotiba phule, ambedkar, periyar, tarabhai shinde, kanshiram ko padhaayaa jaataa he
 It also has Kancha Ilaiah's book along with other scholars
 sattarudh pratishthanon ko dalit vidwaanon ke uthaae sawaalon se pareshaani hoti he
 The word Dalit cannot be used after the High Court order
 isliye dalit shabd hataaya ja rahaa he
 But it has been decided to remove Kancha Ilaiah's book because it insults Hindu religion

 Ramchandra Guha is also accused of similar charges

 Now come on Rafale plane dispute

 Rohini Singh and Ravi Nair caught one thing which was not revealed yet
 donon ne likhaa he ki rafel vimaan banane vaali company ne anil ambani kii ek duusari niskriy company ardl main 35 fisadi hissedari kharid kar 284 karod rupee kaa munafa pahunchaaya he
 This company has nothing to do with making fighter aircraft
 dasso avishen ke saath reliance dephence kaa qaraar hua tha magar dasson ne ek niskriy company kaa share kyon kharida
 According to The Wire report, the company in which Dasso has invested is running at a loss and its revenue is zero
 yahi nahin reliance inphra ne jo saarvajanik filing kii he usase pataa chalata he ki isane vitt varsh 2017-18 main ardl ke 34
 7 percent shares have been sold
 di vir par aap puri report pard sakate hai
 After this report, Rahul Gandhi himself came to press conference and accused the government in new contexts
 tippaniyan Rahul said, "the CEO of Rafael had said that the reason for giving the contract to Anil Ambani beyond HL was that Anil Ambani owned the land
" ab baat nikalati he ki anil ambani kii company main dason ne 284 karod par daalaa or usee paise se anil ambani ne jameen kharidi matlab saaf he ki difolt kisi ho saaf jhooth bol rahaa he
 The big question arises that why Dassault put 284 crore rupees in the 8 lakh company which is not a loss making company
 ise kickbac kehete hai
 So, this is the first kickback given to Mr
 Ambani by Dassault
 and it is clear like day
 ' NDTV ne dasso or anil ambani reliance group se vir kii report ke sambandh main sampark kiya he
 Dasso has not yet responded to the email
 anil ambani reliance group ne enditivi se kaha he ki vah vir kii report par jawaab nahin de rahi he
 But the information related to the transaction has been given in Dasso's 2017 annual report and Reliance Infra's March 2018 annual report

 Do you know that the Academic Affairs Standing Committee of the University of Delhi has ordered the removal of the term Dalit from the books read for the students of MA Political Science
 dalit kii jagah bahujan, ambedkarwaadi yaa anusuchit jati kaa istamaal hoga
 Not only this, the book of Kancha Ilaiah Shepherd has also been removed from the course of political science

 On this news website, N

 But i created a new course called Dalit Bahujan Political Thought

 It also has Kancha Ilaiah's book along with other scholars

 The word Dalit cannot be used after the High Court order
 isliye dalit shabd hataaya ja rahaa he
 But it has been decided to remove Kancha Ilaiah's book because it insults Hindu religion
 dow
 Ramchandra Guha is also accused of similar charges

 Now come on Rafale plane dispute

 Rohini Singh and Ravi Nair caught one thing which was not revealed yet
 donon ne likhaa he ki rafel vimaan banane vaali company ne anil ambani kii ek duusari niskriy company ardl main 35 fisadi hissedari kharid kar 284 karod rupee kaa munafa pahunchaaya he
 This company has nothing to do with making fighter aircraft
 dasso avishen ke saath reliance dephence kaa qaraar hua tha magar dasson ne ek niskriy company kaa share kyon kharida
 According to The Wire report, the company in which Dasso has invested is running at a loss and its revenue is zero
 yahi nahin reliance inphra ne jo saarvajanik filing kii he usase pataa chalata he ki isane vitt varsh 2017-18 main ardl ke 34

 After this report, Rahul Gandhi himself came to press conference and accused the government in new contexts
 tippaniyan Rahul said, "the CEO of Rafael had said that the reason for giving the contract to Anil Ambani beyond HL was that Anil Ambani owned the land
" ab baat nikalati he ki anil ambani kii company main dason ne 284 karod par daalaa or usee paise se anil ambani ne jameen kharidi matlab saaf he ki difolt kisi ho saaf jhooth bol rahaa he
 The big question arises that why Dassault put 284 crore rupees in the 8 lakh company which is not a loss making company
 ise kickbac kehete hai
 So, this is the first kickback given to Mr
 Ambani by Dassault
 and it is clear like day
 ' NDTV ne dasso or anil ambani reliance group se vir kii report ke sambandh main sampark kiya he

 Ramchandra Guha has been appointed as Director by Winter School of Ahmedabad University, the University which has always kept the interest of students at the center, Dr
 ramchandra guha ko niyukt kiya ja rahaa he, guha chaatro ko maanavtaa kii koun si shiksha denge yah gambhir prashn he
 The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad believes that under the direction of such a directionless person, the youth power of the country will not have any feelings towards the country, will not believe in our culture
 agar aisa vyakti aapke santhaan kii madad se deshvirohi gatividhiyon or bharat ko todane kii gatividhiyon ke saath sahyog kare, tab vidhyaarthee parishad aapke santhaan ke khilaaf bada andolan karegi or iske liye sirf aap zimmedaar honge

 Rather, get your syllabus also made by ABVP

 Instead of Dalit, Bahujan, Ambedkarite or Scheduled Caste will be used
 yahi nahin kaancha ilaiya shefrd kii kitaab ko bhi polytical science ke course se hataa diya gaya he
 Manisha Tiwari has written in the wire that in the meeting of the Standing Committee, a proposal was passed that Ilaiah's books be removed because they allegedly dishonor Hinduism
 isi news website par dilli vishvavidlaay ke polytical science vibhaag main padhaane vaale en sukumaar ne apana paksh rakhaa he
 His side is that till the time, only Manu, Kautilya, Tagore, Gandhi Savarkar have been taught in the Department of Political Science

 In which Gautam Buddha, Jyotiba Phule, Ambedkar, Periyar, Tarabhai Shinde, Kanshi Ram are taught

 Do you know that the Academic Affairs Standing Committee of the University of Delhi has ordered the removal of the term Dalit from the books read for the students of MA Political Science
 dalit kii jagah bahujan, ambedkarwaadi yaa anusuchit jati kaa istamaal hoga
 Not only this, the book of Kancha Ilaiah Shepherd has also been removed from the course of political science
 vir main manisha tiwari ne likhaa he ki standing cameti kii baithak main prastaav paas rakhaa gaya ki ilaiya kii kitaaben isliye hataai jaaen kyonki ve kathith taur par hindu dharm kaa apmaan karti hai
 On this news website, N
 Sukumar, who teaches in the Department of Political Science, University of Delhi, has put his side
 unka paksh yahi he ki jamaane tak polytical science vibhaag main manu, kautilya, tagore, gandhi saavarkar ko hi padhaayaa jaataa rahaa he
 But i created a new course called Dalit Bahujan Political Thought
 jisamen gautam buddha, jyotiba phule, ambedkar, periyar, tarabhai shinde, kanshiram ko padhaayaa jaataa he
 It also has Kancha Ilaiah's book along with other scholars
 sattarudh pratishthanon ko dalit vidwaanon ke uthaae sawaalon se pareshaani hoti he
 The word Dalit cannot be used after the High Court order
 isliye dalit shabd hataaya ja rahaa he
 But it has been decided to remove Kancha Ilaiah's book because it insults Hindu religion
 dow
 Ramchandra Guha is also accused of similar charges
 kaancha ilaiya kii kitaaben pard kar dekhie, aapako samaaj ko samajhane kaa gaharaa or nayaa nazariyaa milegaa

 This company has nothing to do with making fighter aircraft
 dasso avishen ke saath reliance dephence kaa qaraar hua tha magar dasson ne ek niskriy company kaa share kyon kharida
 According to The Wire report, the company in which Dasso has invested is running at a loss and its revenue is zero

 After this report, Rahul Gandhi himself came to press conference and accused the government in new contexts
 tippaniyan Rahul said, "the CEO of Rafael had said that the reason for giving the contract to Anil Ambani beyond HL was that Anil Ambani owned the land
" ab baat nikalati he ki anil ambani kii company main dason ne 284 karod par daalaa or usee paise se anil ambani ne jameen kharidi matlab saaf he ki difolt kisi ho saaf jhooth bol rahaa he
 The big question arises that why Dassault put 284 crore rupees in the 8 lakh company which is not a loss making company
 ise kickbac kehete hai
 So, this is the first kickback given to Mr
 Ambani by Dassault
 and it is clear like day

 yahi nahin kaancha ilaiya shefrd kii kitaab ko bhi polytical science ke course se hataa diya gaya he
 Manisha Tiwari has written in the wire that in the meeting of the Standing Committee, a proposal was passed that Ilaiah's books be removed because they allegedly dishonor Hinduism
 isi news website par dilli vishvavidlaay ke polytical science vibhaag main padhaane vaale en sukumaar ne apana paksh rakhaa he
 His side is that till the time, only Manu, Kautilya, Tagore, Gandhi Savarkar have been taught in the Department of Political Science
 lekin maine ek nayaa course banaaya jiskaa naam tha dalit bahujan polytical thot
 In which Gautam Buddha, Jyotiba Phule, Ambedkar, Periyar, Tarabhai Shinde, Kanshi Ram are taught
 isamen anya vidwaanon ke saath kaancha ilaiya kii bhi kitaab he
 The ruling establishment is troubled by questions raised by Dalit scholars
 hoicourt ke aadesh ke baad dalit shabd kaa istamaal nahin ho saktaa he
 Therefore, the word Dalit is being removed
 lekin kaancha ilaiya kii kitaab kya isliye hataane kaa faisla hua he kyonki hindu dharm kaa apmaan karti hai
 Dr

 According to the girl, her brother also supported her father in this painful incident
 ladki 2 maheene se apni bahan or jija ke saath rah rahi thi, kuch din pehle hi apane ghar waapas ai thi
 The girl's father wanted to get her married forcibly but she wanted to study further instead of marriage
 wo is baat par jor de rahi thi jo pita ko naamanzoor tha
 The girl said that my father took me to a secluded place near the canal
 meraa bhai bhi saath main aayaa tha
 My brother tied a cloth over my neck and took me under his control and my father was repeatedly stabbing me with a knife from behind
 maine unase aisa na karne kii bheekh maangi lekin ve nahin ruke
 i was in pain but they did not listen to me
 chaaku se jakhmi karne ke baad nahar main dhakka de diya or ve vahaan se chale gaye
 But after some time, the girl somehow managed to escape from the canal by swimming and approached the brother-in-law with the help of people
 ladki ke jija ne police ko soochna di ki ladki unke saath rah rahi he kyonki uske mata-pita uski shaadi karana chaahate hai
 The police has taken the girl's statement and is investigating the case

 On a financial basis, the Supreme Court has given a big decision on the general category reservation

 The Supreme Court has categorically refused to ban reservations on economic grounds
 haalanki, supreme court ne kaha he ki vah 124wein samvidhan sanshodhan kaa pareekshan karegaa
 Not only this, the Supreme Court has issued a notice to the Central Government and sought a response in this regard within four weeks
 aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan ke faisle rar ste maangane par yachikakarta ko chif justise ne kaha ki ham maamle kaa pareekshan kar rahe hai
 a petition has been filed against the 10 per cent reservation for the economically weaker sections of the general category

 The 124th constitutional amendment has been challenged in the Supreme Court
 inke mutabik aarakshan kaa aadhaar aarthik nahin ho saktaa
 According to the petition, the legislation is against the basic principle of granting reservation to the Constitution and it violates the limit of 50% as per Supreme Court order along with giving 10% reservation to the general class

 Criticism of Hindi Parvakrishnadatta Paliwal contemporary publication, Jatwara, Daryaganj, New Delhi-2, Price: 695 Rs
 dinakar or bachchan ke sandarbh main unke sahi moolyankan main badi baadha unka manch kaa lokapriy kavi hona bhi rahi he
 Paliwal, while being free from this 'stage bias', has also countered this reported injustice with him
 idhar ek arase se hindi main aalochana kii sthiti ko lekar kaaphi bayaanbaji hoti rahi he
 The term rhetoric is being used intently because statements have taken the place of serious discourse
 manch or avasar ke hisaab se, or desh-kaal ke paridrishy ko bhaanpate hue nishkarshatmak vaktavyon se gambhir aalochana nepathy main chali gai he
 Despite some agar but there is a broad consensus on this
 dow
 Krishnadatta Paliwal can be said to be an exception to the above fact that he has written unabashedly on poets and their poetic deeds in the last two decades, from medieval Hindi poetry to the present day
 agyeya or agyeya ke kavi-guru maithilisharan gupt kii granthavliyon ke sampadan ke kram main lagata he, paliwal ne aadhunik hindi kavita ko puri tarah khangaal daalaa he
 a hallmark of this is clearly visible in his latest book Hindi Critique
 yah pustak vaise alag-alag samay or avasaron par likhe gaye nibandhon kaa 'sankalan' he or kul milakar ikkis nibandhon main satraa kaviyon ke kavy-jagat kaa vishleshan-vivechan kiya gaya he, jisamen maithilisharan gupt se lekar vinod kumaar shukla tak shaamil hai, lekin yah aadhunik hindi kavita kaa koi silsilewar or mukammal itihaas prastut nahin karti
 Except Mahadevi Varma, all the poets of Shadowism and Progressivism are completely absent in this discourse
 aisa isliye ki paliwal isamen itihaaskaar kii tarah kinare par khadey hokar kavi or kavita kaa sansparsh bhar nahin karte, balki ve kaviyon ke kavy-sagar main bheetar tak utre hai
 Between chhayavad-pragmatism and the new poem, Makhanlal Chaturvedi, Bachchan and Dinkar are the most important poets of Hindi poetry that have not yet been properly considered
 iskaa ek kaaran sambhawatah yah ho saktaa he ki hindi kavita ko vaadon or andolanon main baandhakar dekhne ke ham is had tak abhyast ho gaye hai ki vaad or andolan kaa apekshaakrit chota kavi bhi itihaas or aalochana main jagah paa jaataa he or inase mukt shashakt kavi bhi footkar kavi rah jaataa he
 In the context of Dinkar and Bachchan, the biggest obstacle in his correct evaluation has been his popularization of the stage in some way or the other
 paliwal ne in kaviyon par is 'manchi purvaagrah' se mukt hokar vichaar karne ke saath unke saath hue is aalochakeey anyaay kaa pratikaar bhi kiya he
 If there is any central concern of the author in these essays, it is to bring the national poetry of Hindi out of the mist of oblivion and neglect
 unka swar dekhieh ''hai ri vidambnaa! hindi kii aadhunik aalochana ne deshbhaktiparak rachana-karm ko tuchh bhavukta kii satahi kavita kahkar thukraa diya he
 Behind this refusal is the conspiracy of Hindi critics who are foreign propagandists or hypocrites
 ye aalochak desh bhakthi ke naam se aise bidakate-bhadakte hai, jaise pagal pani se darataa he
 Paliwal undoubtedly seems to be influenced by Vijaydev Narayan Sahi, so in all these essays he repeatedly quotes Sahi, remembers, present Sahi to prove his point
 phir saahi par likhe unke niabandh main unka aalochakeey tevar apane sabase tejasvi rup main ubhar kar saamne aayaa he to isamen aashcharya nahin hona chahie
 He starts the essay on Sahi in the same way, "the memory of Vijay Dev Narayan Sahi is the never ending memory of the thinking sources of history, society, culture and tradition in the minds of the new generation, which is our progress and Keeps both sides of Indianness warm
 '' ve aage saahi ke prasiddh niabandh laghumaanav ke bahaane hindi kavita par ek bahes ke sambandh main likhte hai, ''akele isi ek lekh ne saahi ko hindi samiksha ke centre main laa diya he
 By composing the sentences of this article, Marxist critics made their 'hanuman Chalisa' and alleviated their fear by singing loudly
 ''pustak main alag-alag nibandhon main ramanaresh treepathi, agyeya, sarveshwar, kunvarnarayan, girijakumar maathur, bhavani bhai, raghuveer sahay, dhoomil, raajakmal choudhary, baalkrishna raav or vinod kumaar shukla ke kavy sansar kii bhi padtaal kii gai he jo in kaviyon ke bahut-se anchhue-alakshith pahaluon kaa khulaasa karte hai
 Analysis capability and memory wealth are under intense attack
 aise vikat samay main is granth ke niabandh hindi main sarjanaatmak aalochana kaa ek nayaa paath hi ujagar karte hai

 Tea has undoubtedly played an important role in enhancing the life and passion, dissolving the melody in it

 Seeing this scene in my arms, i suddenly started feeling pain in my war wound and i felt desperate and my soul suddenly started scorching in an invisible fire

 He trained how to make enemies He did not fill my heart with mercy and compassion, but did not fill my heart with compassion
 He said that this is the color of your soul, i have filled my ears with a heartfelt scream that this is the voice of your duties hanged on my effigies from the corpses
 Bhoomi and said that this is the ideal view of your eyes
 They made me aware of my existence only in being cruel
 c crying bringing restraint Thaawaj he asked me-and-you fighting for? i have this question He was not ready but stabilized himself and said - We both fight for the lust of our king
 We fight because we have been taught to fight
 Every soldier fights for this, my brother
 He got up and thanked for the tea and turned to the door
 He did not take care of his gun, perhaps he intentionally left there
 Him in order to future Liabanduk the issues of toys last seen back then i said -I you smiled Duँgavh killed last war has taught us -that responded

 The feeling of checking something off your “bucket list” gives you an indescribable sense of accomplishment
 
 
 and that’s where i am in this moment
 I've always wanted to write a book, but the timing never felt right
 With each opportunity that presented itself, my first instinct was always to wait
 
 
 because i wasn't (and I'm still not) finished
 i wanted to do more, live more, and achieve more, before putting pen to paper and exposing things I’ve always kept private to the world
 But looking back on my life as a public person, I'm super proud of what I've done and where my life is right now
 I’ve realized you don’t have to be finished to tell your story, and that sometimes life’s greatest lessons are taught along the ride
 
 
 when you're still figuring things out
 
 
 when you’re # unfinished
 So glad to be starting a new chapter (literally) with the amazing teams at Penguin Random House in the US, India, and around the world

 sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki sarkaar bill main kuch badlaav karne ko raji ho gai he
 The changes being made by the government include the suggestions made by the Trinamool Congress
 tippaniyan Explain that the Trinamool Congress had objected to some parts of the bill, saying that it violates the jurisdiction of the states
 lokapal bill ke tahat centre main ek lokapal or saat sadsy honge or bill yah bhi kahata he ki rajyon ko bhi isi tarj par lokayukta banane honge
 The Trinamool, BJP and all other parties did not like the provision directing the states
 unka maananaa tha ki yah upbandh desh ke sangheey dhaanche kaa hris karata he
 These people say that the central government should not give this order but it should be left to the state to form a Lokayukta
 gauratlab he ki saamaajik kaaryakarta anna hajaare or unke sahyogiyon ne pichley saal apane andolan main kaha tha ki yadi rajyon ko is bill main shaamil nahin kiya gaya tab yah bill bekaar sabit hoga
 The government has started talks with all the political parties to support this bill
 bataa den ki trinmul congress ne bill ke kuch hisson par yah kahkar aapatti jataai thi ki isse rajyon ke adhikaar kshetra kaa hanan hota he
 Under the Lokpal bill, there will be one Lokpal and seven members at the center and the bill also states that the states will have to make Lokayukta on the same lines
 trinmul, bhaajapa or tamaam anya dalon ko rajyon ko nirdeshit karne vaala upbandh pasand nahin aayaa tha
 He believed that this provision loses the federal structure of the country
 in logon kaa kahana he ki centre sarkaar ko yah aadesh nahin dena chahie balki yah rajya par chhod diya janaa chahie ki vah kaisaa lokayukta taiyaar karen
 Significantly, social activist Anna Hazare and his colleagues had said in their movement last year that if the states were not included in this bill then this bill would prove to be useless
 is bill ke samarthan ke liye sarkaar ne tamaam raajnneetik dalon se baatcheet aarambh kar di he

 However, Prasad got scared after surrendering his unity and handed himself over to the police
 haalanki police prasad kii is kahani par abhi aankh moond kar bharosa nahin kar rahi he
 Because during the investigation it has also been found that Prasad had bought the knife with which he killed Ekta 15 days in advance and kept it with him

 lekin ekta kaa galaa retane ke baad prasad ghabara gaya or khud ko police ke hawaale kar diya
 However, the police is not blindly trusting Prasad's story yet

 It is also learned that Ekta had started keeping distance from Prasad for the last few months

 gurmeet baba kii baby haniprit bhale hi ambala kii central jail main band ho lekin haryana police kaa kufia tantra abhi bhi uski nigaraanee kar rahaa he
 In fact, the police suspect that Honeypreet may get the evidence missing even though she is in jail
 sutron ke mutabik ambala central jail main bandahanipritkhufia vibhaag nazren gadaaye baitha he
 The biggest reason for this is that he is a special ruler of Gurmeet Ram Rahim who is lodged in Sunaria Jail
 abhi bhi deraa or uske sardaar se jude kai raaj baahar nahin aa paae hai
 During the interrogation, Honeypreet has given answers to only a few questions to the police
 jin sabooton ke bare main haniprit ne police ko bataaya ve bhi abhi tak police kii pahunch se baahar hai
 The police suspect that Honeypreet can erase all the evidence that the police are looking for through any person who comes to meet her
 guuruuvaar ko jab haniprit ke parivaar ne usase mulaakaat kii thi, to us vakt mulaakaati kaksh ke aas-paas intelligence or guptchar vibhaagon ke karmchaaree or gelkarmi bhi mandara rahe the
 The meeting was conducted amid security
 alam ye tha ki jin logon ko shaam ke samay jail se reeha hona tha, unako mulaakaat khatm hone tak roak diya gaya tha
 Significantly, this was the second meeting between Honeypreet and her family within eight days
 isse pehle diwali se thik ek din pehle haniprit kaa parivaar usase milane pahunchaa tha
 Suddenly, within a week, his family again visited him in jail
 police ko shaq he ki haniprit kisi na kisi paariwarik sadsy ke jariye deraa sachcha sauda or uske kai thikaanon main maujuud sandigdh dastavejon or sabooton ko nasht karvaa sakati he
 Panchkula Police's SIT is looking for evidence to prove Honeypreet's role in the violence
 haniprit se poochtacha kar lene ke baad bhi police abhi tak na to uskaa laptop baraamad kar pai he or na hi uski gupt diary
 Apart from violence, there are many secrets related to Dera Sacha Sauda

 In response to Nitish's rally and his allegations, the Congress said that Bihar alone is not backward
 centre main sattarudh congress ne kaha ki pichde kshetron kii madad ke liye centre sarkaar li se hatakar kaam karne main vishwaas rakhti he
 Party spokesperson Rashid Alvi reacted to Nitish's charge of neglecting Bihar by the Center

 If you do not give it today, you will have to pay it in 2014
 " Not trying to hide his role at the national level and his desire to become Prime Minister in view of the next year's general election, Nitish said, "whoever understands the pain of the poor and the backward should rule the country
" " The Chief Minister said that Bihar will not only benefit from their demand, but other backward regions will also get benefit from it

 " nitish kii raily or unke aaropon ke jawaab main congress ne kaha ki akele bihar hi pichhadaa nahin he
 The ruling Congress at the Center said that the central government believes in working out of the box to help the backward regions

 There is absolutely no thinking at the central government to change the reservation criteria from castes to economic conditions

 All the villagers believed in the man's words and with the help of JCB and shovel to see the linga of Lord Shiva, the villagers started digging in between warangal-hyderabad highway
 rashtriya rajmarg ko khodne se pehle vishesh prakaar kii puja-paath kii gai
 The sarpanch of the village and the vice president of the Jangaon municipality also joined the people who believed in this prediction of Manoj
 sarpanch ne bataaya ki manoj bhagwaan shiv ke param bhakt hai or teen saalon se yah sapana dekh rahe hai, unhone hamase shivlinga ko khojane or mandir kaa nirmaan karne main madad karne ke liye kaha
 He prays at this place every Monday and we believe him

 The growing controversy between JDU ministers and spokespersons in Bihar is not being named
 is bich bihar ke purv mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kaha ki pravaktaaon ko aise bayaan dene kii jarurat nahin thi, lekin hamaari party main ye chalata rahaa he
 Nitish said that there is no thought in the party about the removal of Manjhi
 ye pehle hi saaf ho chukaa he, lekin bijepi ke jaal main aane se baaki logon kaa game plan expoj ho rahaa he
 Nitish Kumar said that the state president is currently looking into the matter
 is maamle ko tool nahin diya janaa chahie
 The Speaker has the right to proceed in this matter
 raajnneeti main ye bayaanbaji thodaa bahut chalati he lekin apni baat ko seemaa ke andar hi kahana chahie
 On Nitish's BJP, Varnitish said that the entire BJP has the character of split personality
 split personality to vyakti main hota tha lekin puri party hi split personality kaa shikaar ho gai he
 Earlier, Manjhi was called the government of remote control, now it is said that Manjhi is being harassed
 bijepi ke log hansane par majaboor kar rahe he
 This shows the dual character of the BJP
 'jediu ko todane kaa sapana chhod de bijepi'nitish ne baagi netaaon par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki baagi netaa bijepi se milakar jediu ko todane kaa sapana dekhnaa chhod den
 The party is strong and is strong internally
 party todane kaa ganda khel ye maanjhi sarkaar ke samay se khel rahe hai
 He did the same during the Rajya Sabha elections
 ye tha puraa maamalayad rahe ki party ke naaraaz mantriyon ne party pravaktaaon ke istife kii maang kii thi
 He was questioned by a JDU spokesperson after reports of Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi meeting Sadhu Yadav
 duusare pravaktaa ne maanjhi ke samarthan main bolne vaale teen mantriyon kaa istipha maang liya tha
 Nitish Mishra, Narendra Singh and Vrishan Patel defended Manjhi, saying that they should continue in office

 In the complaint given to the police by the father of the deceased, it is told that Tarsem and Vikas's grandmother went to a wedding ceremony on Tuesday
 jahaan se vah laddu lekar ai
 Grandmother locked the laddus in a box
 jab 20 saal ke tarsem ko canstar main laddu hone kii baat pataa chali to usne taala kholkar laddu kha liye
 At the same time, his cousin Vikas also reached there
 laddu kyonki vikaas ke canstar main rakhe gaye the to use tarsem kii harakat pasand nahin ai
 The two clashed between the laddus and the quarrel took a violent form
 bhai ke seene main maar di goli
 
 
 Both brothers went to the field fighting
 gaali galoch karte hue aaropee vikaas itnaa taish main aa gaya ki usne tarsem ko seene main goli maar di
 As soon as the bullet hit, the psyche fell into the field
 uske baad parivaar ke sadasyon ne vikaas ko gambhir haalat main sthaneey aspataal pahunchaaya
 Where the doctors declared him dead
 police ne mritak tarsem ke pita mitthu laal kii shikaayat ke aadhaar par aaropee vikaas ke khilaaf hatya kaa maamla darj karke use giraftaar kar liya he
 However, the police also say that there could be some other reason behind the murder which is being investigated
 kabhi shikshika raheen anushasanpriya anandiben aaj gujarat main narendra modi kii uttaradhikari ban gayi
 Anandiben, who became the first woman Chief Minister of the state, has the image of a hardened administrator and hardworking leader as Minister of State
 anandiben modi ke karibiyon or vafaadaaron main se ek hai
 The 73-year-old leader was seen as a natural successor to Modi, as he led a group of ministers who had been involved in the day-to-day affairs of the state while engaged in the busiest Lok Sabha election campaign in favor of Modi's own party
 Responsibility was given
 gujarat main anandiben or amit shah ko aksar modi kaa baayan or dahinaa haath kaha jaataa he
 Anandiben has important departments like urban development, revenue and disaster management
 vah pehle shiksha vibhaag kii bhi prabharee mantri rah chuki hai
 She is successfully running some of Modi's important projects including increasing female literacy
 mukhyamantri pad ke liye anandiben ke chunaav main bijepi ke saamaajik sameekaran kaa bhi dhyaan rakhaa gaya he kyonki patel rajya main sabase badi or sarvaadhik prabhaav vaali jati he
 Patel has been the party's main support base for over two decades
 vyarth kii baton se khud ko dur rakhane vaali anandiben rajya sarkaar main sabase lambey samay tak mantri raheen
 Tricolor 1 was hoisted on Lalchouk

 3
 unke ek putr or ek putree hai

 5
 anandiben 1987 main tab puure rajya main charchit hui thim, jab 1987 main vah ek skool main shikshika thim or do ladakiyon ko doobane se bachaane ke liye sardaar sarovar main kud gayi thim
 6
 rajyapal se veerta puraskaar milane ke alaava anandiben ke is saahasik kaary kaa sangyaan bijepi netaaon ne bhi liya
 7
 chunki us daur main kuch bijepi netaaon kaa unke pati se parichay tha, isliye vah chaahate the ki aisi shikshit evam virangana mahila party se jude
 8
 bataur shikshika bhi anandiben ko kai sarkari puraskaar mili
 9
 modi kii uttaradhikari baniin aannadiben unke saath tab se milakar kaam kar rahi hai, jab vah party se judin or modi bataur aresas prachaarak pradesh ke party netaaon se milte-julate rahete the
 10
 donon ke kariyar graph saath saath badhate rahe
 She was the only woman leader who accompanied the then BJP president Murli Manohar Joshi while hoisting the tricolor at Lalchowk in Srinagar in 1992
 11
 Two years later she was elected to the Rajya Sabha
 party main hameshaa hi pratibhashali samajhi jane vaaleen aannadiben ko 1998 main vidhansabha chunaav ladane ko kaha gaya or vah tatkaaleen keshubhai patel sarkaar main mantri baniin
 12
 jab modi party kii aantarik gutbaji kii vajah se gujarat se baahar bhej die gaye, anandiben ne tab bhi modi ke prati apni nishtha ko kabhi nahin chipaaya
 13
 modi ne anandiben ko ahm vibhaagon kii jimmedaari di or unka kad badha
 She soon came to be considered his most trusted cabinet colleague
 14
 As Education Minister Anandiben is credited with implementing the institutional system for transfer and appointment of teachers
 15
 Earlier, there was an ad-hoc system of appointment and transfer, which was believed to lead to corruption
 16
 Anandiben lives a frugal life and she travels throughout the state, monitoring government projects and contacting officials and the public
 17
 Because of her measured behavior, many party leaders say that she does not remain very friendly with party leaders and workers
 18
 Anandiben has always dismissed such criticism, saying that she should not be evaluated by her work, but by looking at the smile on her face

 The police colony of Paharganj also remains a hub for dengue and chikungunya patients

 People are suffering from joint pain, fever and body aches

 Therefore, people are forced to get treatment from private hospitals and doctors
 ek ghar kii ye sachai he
 Rohan has been suffering from Chikungunya for the last 8 days
 maa-baap pareshaan hai
 If RML Hospital is not satisfied with the treatment, then BL Kapoor was taken and got treatment so that the disease could be controlled at the right time
 ilaake ke logon kii yahi sthiti he balki yun kahe to puri dilli ke logon ke aaj yahi halaat hai
 The MCD did not take care of it
 The complaint of the people in the whole area is that the MCD did not even come here to peek in this entire season
 kuch roj pehle jab koi special afasar aayaa to emsidi vaale bhi dikhaave ke liye chale aae
 Dillu and Chikungunya have caused many deaths in the capital till now
 ab aise main yahi bada sawaal he ki aakhiramasidismay rahete in bimariyon ke liye taiyaar kyon nahin rahata
 And why the government does not keep hospitals ready in this era of diseases
 bade-bade rihaayshi ilaakon ko nazarandaaj karne kaa hi nateeja hai jo dilli main ye halaat paidaa ho jate hai

 bhagwaan vishnu ke avatar shrikrishna kaa jivan kisi sabak se kam nahin
 His lessons are extremely meaningful despite being easy to understand
 shri krishna ne apane jivan main har rishte ko behad saralata ke saath paribhaashit kiya he or use eemaandaaree se nibhaayaa he
 Learn how relationships are played with Shri Krishna
 
 
 dosti kaa rishtabhagwan shrikrishnaur sudama kii mitrataa hamen bachapan se isliye padhai-sikhaai jaati he, kyonki wo hamen rishton kii kadra karnaa or doston ke liye kuch bhi karne ke liye taiyaar rahane ke liye prerit karti hai
 At the same time, krishna-sudama taught us this most important relationship, away from the restrictions of high and low, rich-poverty, small and big
 sudama, krishna ke bachapan ke mitra the
 He was a very poor person, but Krishna never allowed money and status to come between his friendship
 ve arjuna ke bhi bahut achche mitra the or draupadi ke bhi bahut achche sakha the
 The parents are called sons of Krishna Devaki and Vasudev, but they were raised by Yashoda and Nanda
 bhagwaan krishna ne devaki va yashoda donon maanon ko apane jivan main baraabar kaa sthaan diya or donon ke prati apane kartavyon ko bakhubi nibhaayaa
 In this way Krishna taught the world that parents have an important role in our life, so we should dedicate our life to the service of our parents
 bhagwaan krishna se seekhney kaa yah sabase achche sabak main se ek he
 Despite being the incarnation of Lord Vishnu as a god, Shri Krishna had great respect for his gurus
 apane avatar rup main ve jin bhi santon se mili unka unhone purna sammaan kiya
 There were a lot of fans and love for his girlfriend
 lekin vrundavan main radha ke prati unka pyaar jivan kaa sabase mahatvapurn hissaa rahaa he, jahaan vah nand or yashoda dwaara laae gaye the
 In Vrindavan, Krishna made love with Radha
 keval radha hi krishna kii divaani nahin thi, balki vrundavan kii kai gopiyankrishnako man hi man hi man apana maan chuki thi
 They used to create Raas Leela together with Radha and Gopis
 krishna inase pyaar ke saath-saath sammaan bhi karte the
 Today's lovers get to learn a lot from the love of Kosri Krishna and respect for the girlfriends

 unhone kaha he ki ucchtam nyaayalay ke paas aatankwaadiyon ke cese ko sunne ke liye raat main bhi vakt mil jaataa he lekin mandir ke mudde ko pichley kai saalon se taala ja rahaa he
 Talking to reporters in his parliamentary constituency Nawada, Giriraj Singh said that among the 100 crore people there is restlessness and outrage over the issue of Ram temple
 giriraaj singh ne kaha, ''sheetakaaleen satr main bhaajapa ke rajyasabha saansad rakesh sinha ram mandir par privet member bill lekar aane vaale hai
 During this time it will be important to see how the Congress Party comes forward in honor of 100 crore Hindus of the country
 What is the stand of other political parties? ''125 karod janata ke andar aakroshabijapi saansad giriraaj singh ne saath hi yah bhi kaha ki desh kii 125 karod janata ke andar vyakulata or aakrosh he
 He said, "I think both the government and the court should find a way together
" kitne saal ho gaye, abhi tak court main is maamle ko keval taala ja rahaa he
 Giriraj Singh gave Yakub Menon an example of the hanging case, saying, "there have been many issues that have been settled even at midnight
" aatankwaadiyon ke liye samay he or prabhu ram ke liye nahin
 Ram temple is the center of faith of 1
25 billion Hindus
 logon kii ummiido par pani phiraa he isiilie unke andar aakrosh he
 "giriraj Singh said that the path will be found and there is no power in the world that can stop the temple from being built

 guzarana gaalib kii ruh senatak: kaid-e-hayatnaatakakaar surendra vermanirdeshak: danish ikbalkalakaar: danish ikbaal, nidhi mishra, sadanand patil, vasundhara bosakhyatnaam shaayar mirza gaalib kii jindagi par vaise to kai naatak likhe gaye hai lekin suredra verma ke likhe is naatak kaa majaa hi alag he or agar ise salike vaala nirdeshak mil jaae to naatak dekhnaa vaaki ek quality experions ho jaataa he
 Although Danish Iqbal is educated from the National School of Drama (NSD), all the nsds also gasp in taking up such plays written in Urdu
 andeshaa unako lekar bhi tha
 But with the text being cluttered, he finally managed to capture Ghalib's spirit
 kahani kul jamaa ye he ki gaalib (danish) ke yahaan udhari vasuulne waalon kaa tantaa laga hua he
 He goes to Calcutta in connection with pension and litigation
 lautne par bhi, karj na chukaane kii vajah se ghar main najarband hai
 While writing his poetry, Katiba (nidhi), who was kind to him, dies in agony
 ek sade-se baithkkhaane main samvaad ke jariye shuru main hi saaf ho jaataa he ki gaalib or unki begum umrao (vasundhara) ke bich kuch bhi thik nahin
 The house is just moving
 gaalib jatil likh rahe hai, yah baat unheen ke samakaleen yaccin (patil) unke saath batiyate hue baar-baar unhen ehsaas karaate hai, vah bhi apni shairana anth ke saath
 Ghalib says: "kami is not in my mind, it is in people's understanding
" ” khud par vyangy or tanj kaa yah gaalib kaa hi andaaj he jab deewangi kii tapish main tadapati katiba se ve kehete hai, ''main ek acha shaayar hum, yah baat sirf do log jaanate hai
 One you and one me
 ” ghar main tanaav, pratidwandviyon ke daanvpench, katiba kii deewangi or upar se sir khaataa, 20,000 gajalen rach chukaa swaghoshit shagird parvej
 Nidhi gives a deep feeling to Katiba's desire, helplessness and yearning in the same manner that Danish instigates Ghalib's duel with emotion and feeling
 kingdom of drims ke charchit naatak jangura main mukhya khalanaayak joravar ke rup main charchit patil yahaan ekadam alahada kism ke nafis kirdaar ko jite hai
 Vasundhara Bose adds a shocking aspect in terms of acting
 apane duusare hi naatak main gaalib kii nitant asantusht, udign or asahaay ardhangini umrao ke kirdaar main unki bhangimaayein unka bahut kuch kah jaati hai
 Now whenever it has a show, you can watch it without any doubt

 isse pehle muraina main mahatma gandhi kii pratimaa ko aag lagaayi gayi thi or ab mahasabha ne baapu ke hatyare kaa mandir gwalior main banaaya he
 We demand that a case of treason be filed against these people
 'varisht congress netaa jyotiraditya sindhiya ne is maamle main twit kiya, ‘baapu ke hatyare kaa ek mandir gwalior main shivaraj singh chouhan kii naak ke neeche banaaya gaya he, jabaki chouhan gandhi ke naam par ‘upwas’ karne kaa naatak karte hai

 ’gandhiji ke naam kaa sahaara lekar upwas kaa dhong karne vaale@chouhanshivrajki naak ke neeche baapu ke hatyare kaa mandir sthapit kiya ja rahaa he
