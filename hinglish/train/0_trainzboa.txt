 The SIT of Haryana Police has disclosed this fact
 esaiti kii team ab dhire-dhire is puure maamle kii tah tak pahunch rahi he
 During the 6-day police remand, Honeypreet, the mastermind of the violence, said in the interrogation that the areas of Panchkula were to spread violence
 baqayada uske maanchitr taiyaar kiye gaye the
 Dera's special confidants were deployed to spread violence
 unke naam or maanchitr haniprit ke ek laptop main surakshit hai

 During the last 6 days, the police could not get information from Honeypreet to the most wanted people of the camp who were not only involved in spreading the violence but they also helped Honeypreet to escape
 police ne court ke saamne haniprit kaa police remand badhaane kii daleel dete hue bataaya ki haniprit insa ko dere ke mostwonted da
 There is also information about Aditya Insa, Pawan Insa and Gobhi Ram
 isliye police uski madad se un logon ko pakadana chaahati he

 At the same time, the Chinese-made HQ2B missile was no less threatening
 is missile main 190 kilo warhed le jane kii kshamta he jo apane target ko 20 kilometre kii duuri par hi pakad leti he
 The missile moved towards the Indian fighter jet at a speed of 1150 meters per second
 apane target ke najadik pahunchate hi is missile par laga proximity fus khul jaataa he or yah joardaar dhamaakaa karti he
 It was difficult for any Indian fighter jet to survive
 tippaniyan However, during the Kargil War, the Indian Air Force had a distinct edge
 bharat ke paas pakistan kii tulana main ladaaku vimaanon kii sankhya zyada thi or vah zyada behatar hathiyaaron se las the, jisase vah dushman ko intercept kar sakate
 Fighter jets like mig 29, Mirage 2000 of India have a provision for long-range fire-missile air-missiles, whereas Pakistan's fighter aircraft did not have this facility
 isse yah saaf he ki pakistani airforce bhartiya ladaaku vimaanon ko keval dogphite (aamane-saamne kii ladaai) main hi anges kar paati kyonki dushman jahaajon main choti duuri kii maarak kshamta vaali or america main bani sivinder missile hi lag paati thim
 Perhaps it was this growth that caused the government to prepare for the airstrikes, but the Indian government's decision not to carry on the Kargil war kept the plan a secret till now
 baharhaal, july 1999 main bhartiya sena ne kargil main apni sabhi poston se dushmano ko khaded diya or vijay pai

 yadhyapi, kargil yuddh ke samay, bhartiya vayusena ke paas ek khaas tarah kii badhat thi
 India had a higher number of fighter aircraft than Pakistan and was equipped with much better weapons, allowing it to intercept the enemy
 bharat ke mig 29, miraj 2000 jaise ladaaku jet main lambii duuri kii maarak kshamta vaali air-missile lagane kaa praavdhaan he, jabaki pakistan ke ladaaku vimaan ke paas yah suvidha uplabdh nahin thi
 This makes it clear that the Pakistani Air Force could engage Indian fighter jets only in dogfight (face-to-face combat) as the enemy ships could carry short range firepower and us-made Cywinder missiles

 However, in July 1999, the Indian Army repulsed and won the enemy from all its posts in Kargil

 Until these community ships receive air defenses in the form of multi-purpose helicopters, it is very difficult to protect these ships from submarine attacks and this is a major challenge today

 He said that it was decided that 123 NMRH will be developed in India under the strategic partnership model, but if the import is not to be done then the strategic partner ie the helicopter manufacturer should be identified

 It is said that when the Scheduled Castes Commission sent a written notice to the Registrar that you discriminate against students and teachers, it is not right then i got a salary for january-february
 ayog ne ab dilchaspee leni chhod di he to mujhe march se lekar ab tak selary bhi nahin di ja rahi he
 Not only this, the university has sent a notice to Arun Kumar Chaudhary that you are not attending college

 i have not given chair / table in Staff room bcse of my Chamar Caste, still facing discrimination in 21st century
 akhir arun ne chand-taare to nahin maange hai
 i also retweeted Arun's tweet
 lihaaza pratikriya main kai nagarikon kaa jawaab aayaa he ki aisa bhi ho saktaa he unhen yakeen nahin ho rahaa he
 He also became a partner of this suffering of Arun
 kuch log aisi bhi the jo turant aarakshan ke virodh kii baat karne lage
 These are the people who were justifying their behavior with Arun Kumar Chaudhary
 bhatinda ke arun kumaar se phone par baatcheet hui or unke anusaar jo kahani he wo is tarah se he
 Punjabi University, Patiala has a regional center in Bhatinda
 vahaan kii lau faikalti main 6 pad hai
 One post of Assistant Professor is reserved for Scheduled Castes
 2011 main pehali baar kantrect par hua
 Whenever the interview did not take place except Arun, the university had to reinstate him in 2012
 sthaayee pad kii vaikency hone ke baavjood arun kumaar choudhary kantrect par rakhe jate rahe
 Arun Kumar has also studied from the same regional center
 jab arun kumaar choudhary ne awaz uthaani shuru ki to unhen lekar vibhaag ke puraane shikshakon ko pareshaani hone lagi
 "I was not invited to the meeting to share the work of the teachers
 mujhe teaching se alag kaam diya jaataa tha ki aap dopaher do baje class khatm hone ke baad shaam paanch baje tak college main ruko
 While all the teachers used to go home
 mujhe chuttee ke din bhi centre main bulaayaa jaataa tha'', phone par baat karte hue arun kumaar na to bhavuk the na uttejit
 He was speaking in a very restrained and logical manner

 vibhaag ke profasaran nahin chaahate the isliye taalane ke liye yah jimmaa mujhe de diya
 i made that seminar a success
 tab se unhen laga ki arun to dabane vaala nahin he
 i was also diligently teaching the students
 tabhi achaanak mujhe pataa chalata he ki centre ke 35 logon ne mere kilaaf likhit shikaayat kii he
 i had not even seen the face of many of these people during my two-month tenure

 There was a phone conversation with Arun Kumar of Bathinda and according to him the story is like this
 punjabi vishvavidhyalay, patiala kaa bhatinda main ek riginal centre he
 There are 6 posts in the flame faculty
 sahaayak professor kaa ek pad anusuchit jati ke liye arakshit he
 In 2011, it was first contracted

 Arun Kumar Chaudhary kept on contracting despite having vacancy for the permanent post
 arun kumaar ne isi riginal centre se padhai bhi kii he
 When Arun Kumar Chaudhary started raising voice, the old teachers of the department started having problems with him
 ''teacheron ke kaam ke bantwaare ke liye hone vaali baithak main mujhe nahin bulaayaa jaataa tha
 i was given a different job than teaching that you should stay in the college till five in the evening after finishing class at 2 pm
 jabaki saare teacher ghar chale jate the
 i was also called to the center on a holiday, ”arun Kumar was neither emotional nor excited while talking on the phone

 The department's professors did not want to, so gave me this task to postpone
 maine us seminar ko kaamyaab bana diya
 Since then, he felt that Arun was not going to press

 Then suddenly i come to know that 35 people of the center have written a complaint against me

 a lady teacher in my department alleged that i called her and used abusive language
 baad main chaparasi se lekar clerk tak ne us memorondom par dastakhat kiye ki main anushaasan todta hum or vyavhaar thik nahin he
 The university formed a three-member committee to investigate this, all of which were from the regional center and one of them was a complainant
 meraa saamaajik bahishkaar bhi kiya gaya
 After the report of the committee, i was sent to Junir town of Mansa district, 250 km from Bathinda
 vahaan kanoon kaa koi vibhaag hi nahin he
 i was forced to teach English
 dhai saal tak maine vahaan angrezi padhai jabaki main elelbi, ellem hum
 i was not transferred, sent in the name of deputation so that there is no question that a hundred people have been taken on contract, why one of them is being transferred
 maine 20 may 2015 ko april ko vaais chancelar ko i-mail kiya ki mujhe pratadit kiya ja rahaa he or main tanaav main aakar aatmahatya kar saktaa hum
 You will be responsible for this

 Whether banned or not, Indian cities topped in porn search
 google trend ke taaja aankadon ke mutabik, duniya bhar memporn sarchakarne vaale chah pramukh shahar bharat ke hai
 In the country's capital, Delhi, porn search was the highest on Google
 iske baad pune, mumbai, haavda, unnav, kualalampur or bengalooru hai
 According to the data, people searched for other material along with searching for the erotic stuff
 haalanki samajashastri online activity ko ofline gatividhiyon se jodne se bilkul inkaar karte hai
 So all these searches are done on the internet
 
 
 varsh 2008 se ab tak 'animal porn' search karne main pune ke log aage hai
 After that people of Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru also searched it very well respectively
 jabaki rape kevideo sarchakarne main kolkata ke log sabase aage hai
 After this people from Howrah, Delhi, Ahmedabad and Pune also registered a presence in this category

 Because in countries like China, Russia and North Korea, Google is not used, even if it is very little
 iske alaava america or britain jaise deshon main log alag-alag search ingine istemaal karte hai

 ajit pavaar ne 2016 main jab uddhav thakare ke saamne prastaav rakhaa ki aaie, rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) or congress gathbandhan ke saath milakar maharashtra kii devendra fadanvis kii aguai vaali bhaajapa sarkaar ko gira den, to shivasena pramukh koi faisla hi na kar paae the
 Three years later, today Thackeray himself is busy reviving Pawar's same proposal to fulfill his dream of 'making a Shiv Sainik chief minister' in India's richest state
 fadanvis ne 30 aktubar ko jab yah daawa kiya ki unki party ne shivasena ke saath dhai-dhai saal ke liye mukhyamantri kaa pad baantne ko lekar koi charchaa tak nahin kii thi, to thakare ne bhaajapa kaa saath chhod dene kaa faisla le liya
 Ahat Thackeray told reporters in Mumbai on 8 November, more than two weeks after the results of Maharashtra's 288-member Assembly were declared, "for the first time, someone has called me a liar
" '' bhaajapa ne 105 siten, sena ne 56, ensipi ne 54 or congress ne 44 siten jeetin or kisi bhi dal ko bahumat nahin mila he
 Uddhav claimed that BJP president Amit Shah had agreed on a power-sharing formula in a meeting at his residence
 thakare ne kaha, ''agar unhone kaha hota ki ve samjhaute kaa paalan nahin karenge, to bhi sambhav he ki main maan jaataa
 But he flatly refused any such conversation and this is what is bothering me
 bhaajapa jhuuthon kii party he
 On 11 November, he also resigned the only representative of Shiv Sena in the Union Cabinet, Arvind Sawant, and thus the two parties formally separated the way
 bhaajapa ke saath raste alag karne ke baad shivasena ke netaa congress or ensipi ke saath gathbandhan karne ke liye ji-tod koshishen kar rahe hai
 Thackeray, exhibiting inordinate modesty, went to Bandra's five-star hotel to meet NCP chief Sharad Pawar
 unhone pehali baar congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko phone kiya or saat minute chali baatcheet main unase samarthan kaa anurodh kiya
 However, the congress-ncp does not seem in a hurry to support the Shiv Sena
 unhone rajyapal kii nirdhaarit 11 november kii dedline ke bheetar apana samarthan patr nahin saunpa, jiske natijatan agle din raashtrapati shashan kii ghoshnaa kar di gai
 Thackeray kept hoping, while Pawar continued to discuss with Sonia Gandhi's political secretary Ahmed Patel in Mumbai on 12 November whether he could reach an agreement with the Shiv Sena
 patel ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ''kisi nirnay par pahunchane se pehle kai binduon par spashtataa kii jarurat hoti he
 "we (congress-ncp) will discuss among ourselves first and if we agree to form a government with the Shiv Sena, then we (shiv Sena) will discuss further with them," Pawar said
 raashtrapati shashan kii avadhi chah maheene kii hoti he, hamaare paas charchaa ke liye paryaapt vakt he
 The congress-ncp stance has left Thackeray in the middle
 is anumaan main ki congress-ensipi bhi bhaajapa ko satta se baahar rakhane ke liye utani hi utsuk hongi, thakare unase twarit pratikriya kii aas lagaae baithe the
 On November 12, Thackeray said, "we will discuss the points on which they want clarity
" main bhi unase kai binduon par spashtataa chahta hum
 We will sit together and draft a minimum common program
 ''rajnatik paryvekshakon kaa maananaa he ki hindutv vichaardhaara ke prati shivasena kii patibaddhta gathbandhan ke aade aa rahi he, haalanki jab patel or pavaar se iske bare main poocha gaya to unhone kuch nahin kaha
 a Congress source says that if the party joins the government along with NCP and Shiv Sena, then it will put up the demand of 12 Ministries along with the post of Speaker of the Assembly
 ensipi bhi aadhe kaarykaal ke liye mukhyamantri pad chaahati he
 If it becomes an alliance, the NCP will in fact benefit the most
 isse pavaar ko sarkaar kaa hissaa banane or aantarik kalah se mukti paakar party ke punarnirmaan kaa mauka milegaa
 According to a close aide of the Maratha stalwart, he would keep demands for key ministries like revenue, rural development, finance and water resources
 congress ko bhi isse pradesh main nayaa jivan milegaa
 Political commentator Hemant Desai says, "ncp-congress veteran ministers will dominate the government more than inexperienced members of the army
" ''nagpur-mumbai super com-communication expresve, navi mumbai hawaii adda, mumbai metro or mumbai tateey sadak jaisi kai mahatvapurn infrastracchar pariyojnaon kii kismat nai sarkaar par tiki he

 There are more screws in the story
 bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa kaa kahana he ki party ne sharad pavaar ke saamne prastaav diya he ki agar ensipi, endie kaa hissaa ban jaati he or 2014 kii tarah vah rajya kii bhaajapa sarkaar ko baahar se samarthan dene ko raji ho jate hai to kendriya mantrimandal main unki beti supriya sule ko shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Simultaneously, the BJP has opened the doors for back-channel dialogue with the Congress and has asked it not to support the Shiv Sena in the state
 bhaajapa netaa ne kaha ki patel kii kendriya parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ke saath 6 november ko baithak hui thi
 "I think they have discussed the possibility of political uncertainty in Madhya Pradesh and whether the Congress should support the Shiv Sena," he says
 ''shivasena ke purv siem or ab bhaajapa ke rajyasabha saansad narayan rane kaa kahana he ki congress-ensipi thakare ko bevakoof bana rahi hai
 He said on November 12, "my party has tasked me to raise sufficient numbers (145) to form the government in Maharashtra
" main kaam par jute gaya hum or mujhe vishwaas he ki main jald hi apana kaam kar duungaa
 "thackeray may be the biggest loser in all this political turmoil
" ensipi or kattar pratidwandvi congress se sampark sadhakar unhone dikhaa diya he ki sarkaar banane main agar koi madad kare to unke liye koi bhi asprishy nahin he
 Even after so many maneuvers, if he fails to make a Shiv Sainiks chief minister, then this could be the beginning of the end of his leadership

 police ne 3 din main hi premi or premika ko giraftaar kar liya
 During this, the girlfriend put the blame on her lover's head
 police ne unke paas se saadhe 4 lakh rupee baraamad kiye hai
 The incident is of Ratanpur police station area of bilaspur
 vahaan rahane vaale sivakumar dube ne police main shikaayat darj karai thi ki kisi anjaan shaks ne unkeghar se 7 lakhrupee kii nagdi gaayab kar di
 On 20 May, the police registered a theft complaint at the police station
 dube police ko bataaya ki 19 may kii shaam yaa raat main rakam gaayab hui he
 Because he kept the amount in the vault on the same day in the morning
 jayja lene police team sivakumar dube ke ghar pahunchi
 Interacted with all the members of the house
 ghar ke naukar se lekar padosiyon tak poochtacha kii gai
 During the questioning, Dubey's daughter Maya was cleverly answering every question
 usne kai aisi jaankaree police ko di, jisase andeh ho rahaa tha ki wo kaalpanik tathy jaahir kar police kii jaanch ko bhatakaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 However, the police had suspected that only one member of the house had cleared the money
 police ne kufia tantra ko sakriy kiya to pataa chalaa ki do teen din se maaya khub mouj masti kar rahi he
 He has no qualms about the theft in the house
 is bich police ko jaankaree lagi ki maaya kaa premi prakaash naamak shaks bhi do teen dinon se hajaaron rupee apni shaan shaukat main uda rahaa he
 The police questioned both of them again
 police un dukaanon main bhi ja pahunchi, jahaan se maaya or prakaash ne kapadon or duusare saamaan kii jamkar karidadaari kii thi
 After adding many evidences and facts, the suspicion of the police turned into confidence
 police ne maan liya ki yuvati ne apane premi ke saath milakar ghar kii tijori main hi send lagaai he
 Both were arrested by the police
 sakhti se poochtacha kii gai to sara raaj khul gaya
 Actually, Maya had seen her father keep millions in the vault
 usne yah baat apane premi prakaash ko bataai
 Both decided to clear the money
 mauka pate hi maaya ne tijori kii chaabi apane kabje main lee or palak jhapakate hitijori se rakamanikaal lee
 Then both of them had a feast in a restaurant and divided the amount among themselves
 5 lakh rupee prakaash ne rakhe or do lakh kii rakam maaya ne
 Police has recovered one lakh eighty thousand rupees from Maya's possession and Rs 2 lakh 65 thousand rupees from Prakash's possession

 The rest was blown away by both fun and shopping

 - digvijaya singh (@ digvijaya_28) June 3, 2015 pakistan ke videshmantri shah mahmud kuraishi ne ravivaar ko kaha ki yah kahana anuchit hoga ki mumbai hamalaa maamle main unke desh ne paryaapt karrwai nahin kii he
 Qureshi promised to take action against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks and said that it would not happen that Pakistan would be given clues and would be asleep
 mumbai hamale ke maamle main pakistan main saat logon ke khilaaf mukademe kii gati par bharat ke sawaalon par kuraishi ne kaha ki aparaadh ek duusare mulk main hua or soochnaaon ke aadan pradaan kii prakriya ‘bojhil’ he, in tathyon ke maddenjar jo ‘jatiltaayen’ saamne ain, unki vajah se mukademe kii gati dhimi padi
 The Pakistani Foreign Minister said that India and Pakistan should work together so that the message reaches the terrorists that they will not be able to create a gap between the two countries
 bharat kii shikaayat ki pakistan ne mumbai par hamalaa karne waalon ko salaakhon ke peeche pahunchane ke liye bahut prayaas nahin kiya, par kuraishi ne kaha ki yah kahana anuchit hoga
 Qureshi said, 'do not question our seriousness
 ham karrwai karnaa chaahate hai kyonki aatankwaad ham par bhi waar kar rahaa he
 'india complains that Pakistan is not taking action against the mastermind of the Mumbai attacks and Jamaat-ud Dawa chief Hafiz Mohammad Saeed and other absconding masters
 is ore dhyaan akshirt karaane par kuraishi ne kaha, ‘aapako aisa isliye lag rahaa he kyonki ham baatcheet nahin kar rahe hai
 You are feeling this because we are not in touch
 ’kuraishi ne kaha ki jab donon paksh ‘baithenge, mulaakaat or baat karenge to aisa nahin lagegaa or hakeekat saamne aa jaaegi

 He said, 'we feel that by making such statements you (india) are playing in the hands of those who do not want to see our relations improve
 jaise hi aap aisa kehete hai, aatankwaadiyon ko lagata he ki unhone agenda ko haath main kar liya
 "he said," God forbid that there is any terrorist incident in India or Pakistan, we have to deal with it together
 ’kuraishi ne kaha ki bharat or pakistan ko aatankwaadiyon ko yah sandesh bhejnaa chahie ki donon deshon ke bich daraar paidaa karke unhen apane mansoobey puure karne kii ijaajat nahin di jaaegi or donon desh ‘aatankwaadiyon ko haraane ke liye haath milaayenge
 Qureshi said that the Government of Pakistan had never wanted the Mumbai attack and condemned this 'unfortunate' incident
 unhone jor diya ki bharat yaa kisi anya desh ke khilaaf pakistan apni sarajameen kaa istemaal nahin hone degaa
 India wants it to conduct a thorough investigation against the terrorists responsible for the Mumbai attacks on the basis of the clues it has provided to Pakistan

 Quoting the complexities, Qureshi said that the exchange of information takes time and the whole process is cumbersome and time consuming

 ) saal 2018 main siyasat 2019 ke chunaavon ko lekar hogi
 This is true of every year before the general election, but since Modi and Shah have won the election campaign, this is likely to happen even more this year
 centre sarkaar kii harek niti uske chunavi asar or nateezon kii roshni main padhi jaaegi or saanskrithik yuddh kii harek chaal—swayambhu gorakshak, ayodhya, lav jehad, ghar vaapasi—hinduon ke janasankhyikee bahumat ko vishaal siyaasi dhade main badalane or sangh parivaar ke ghoshit lakshya hindu raashtra kii chunavi buniyaaden rakhane kii koshish ke taur par dekhi jaaegi
 The elections for the eight legislatures to be held this year will not only be important in their own right, but they will also be like the stops in the way of the big fire test of 2019
 bahut kuch in chunaavon par nirbhar he; na keval aam chunaavon kii rakrataar or takat, balki rajyasabha main rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) kaa bahumat bhi, jo use satta main apane pehle kaarykaal ke zyaadaatar vakt hasil nahin ho sakaa
 If the BJP wins Meghalaya, Mizoram and Karnataka out of the eight states ready for elections and retains power in the states which are already in power, it will increase the number of states in its rule to 22 and give the Congress two The states — Punjab and Aden — will cover the state from Puducherry
 agar aisa hota he (or yah sambhaavna ke daayre se pare nahin he), to modi or shah kaa congress-mukt bharat kaa lakshya bhaajapa ke pehle kaarykaal ke bheetar hi hasil ho jayega
 So despite the Congress's better performance in Gujarat and the rumors of Rahul Gandhi's revival, 2018 is the year when the party is in a literal sense of the word, two-four from the existential crisis
 agar vah dakshin bharat main apni hukumat vaala akelaa acha-khaasaa rajya karnataka ganvaa detii he, to bihar or uttar pradesh main uski siyaasi apraasangikta ko dekhte hue rashtriya vipaksh hone kaa uskaa pehle se taar-taar daawa or bhi chhin-bhinn ho jayega
 Even though it can claim its opposition presence in many states, by losing Karnataka, the Congress will look like a politically orphaned calf who is cursed to wither away in the absence of the life-giving blood of power
 kisi ek bhi bade or amir soobe main phydemand satta se vanchit hokar ek rashtriya party siyaasi taur par anaath kii tarah hi hoti he, kyonki uske paas paisa ugaahne ke ve maukey nahin hote jinase vah apni chunavi jang kii tijori bhar sake
 The Congress has already lost the tremendous patronage that it had achieved due to the control at the Center, in view of this Karnataka's defeat can be fatal
 jahaan tak siyaasi sambhaavna kii baat he, karnataka kii takkar 2018 kii sabase ahm chunavi ladaai he
 It is not to say that the elections of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan are not very important for the future of the Congress in the Hindi speaking states which determine the political destiny of any All India Party
 phir bhi yah maananaa hoga ki karnataka ke bagaiyr congress ke paas na kila hoga or na hi shastraagaar
 By mid-2016, there was widespread consensus in the media that the Siddaramaiah-led Karnataka government, being the Gaddinshin party, was buried under the burden of its impeccable and uninteresting record of functioning
 yah yaad rakhana munasib hoga ki 2013 main jab siddharamaiya kii aguai main congress ne bhaajapa par fatah hasil kii, usase pehle bhaajapa rajya kii satta main thi
 One of the reasons the Congress won the election was that the vote share of the BJP was severely reduced due to the defection of Yeddyurappa
 bhrashtachar ke gambhir aaropon kii vajah se mukhyamantri ke ohade se hataa die jane se naaraaz yediurppa ne badla lete hue toote hue dhade ke saath ek alag party karnataka janata paksh (kegepi) bana lee thi
 In the 2013 assembly elections, the KJP got only half a dozen seats, but managed to capture 10 per cent of the popular votes, which could otherwise go to the bjp's tally, thus reducing it to 40 seats in the assembly
 yediurppa ke bhaajapa ke paale main lautne se party ko apni siten badhaane main madad milani chahie, par congress is chunauti kaa muqabla karne ke liye ek saal pehle kii banisbatan behatar haalat main najar aati he
 Some credit must be given to the Chief Minister
 bhed-paalak kuruba parivaar main janme siddharamaiya congress kii siyasat main der se aae or apane saath party main jamini urja or obisi samarthak laae, jinaki usamen us vakt behad kami thi jab es

 The government has supported its rural supporters through a large debt waiver in 2017 and its Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda has aggressively promoted cultivation of grains such as ragi and bajra, especially when the drought and water crisis paddy And made sugarcane cultivation impractical
 dilachasp baat yah he ki siddharamaiya ne kshetreey or up-rashtriya masakadon kii khatir kiye ja rahe jhande, raashtragit or bhashaa ke bhaajapa ke istemaal ko apane hisaab se dhaal liya he
 He raised his voice in favor of the state flag, molded himself as Kannada surma and blamed the use of Hindi signage at the Bangalore metro station and attacked the protest against the imposition of Hindi at the hands of the central government
 spoke
 isi ke saath ek or hakeekat yah he ki karnataka videshi pratyaksh nivesh hasil karne vaale chaar sabase awwal hindustani rajyon main bana hua he or desh ke ity udyog kaa centre he
 Combining these two things, Congress should get a fair chance to retain power in this very important province
 congress main khaas taur par nivesh nahin karne vaale vishwa vaani or public tivi sareekhe media sanghathanon ke shuruaati surveykshan bataate hai ki siddharamaiya bamushkil tamaam bahumat bhar hasil kar sakate hai
 The problem with this scenario is that it does not include a person who has increased the strength of the BJP manifold - Narendra Modi
 siddharamaiya ne 2013 kaa chunaav mukhya taur par yediurppa or unke bhrashtachar se vabsta bhaajapa sarkaar ke khilaaf jeeta tha
 They will contest the 2018 election against a party that will contest in the name of its overwhelmingly popular Prime Minister with a unique mastery of inflammatory rhetoric and political gimmick
 yah chunaav modi ke liye bhi ek chunauti or saath hi dakshini soobe main apane karishme ko voton main badalane kii unki kshamta kaa imtihaan hoga
 They have managed to do this once before, when the BJP won most of the Lok Sabha seats from Karnataka in the 2014 general elections
 jis tarah oonche daanv lage hai, use dekhte hue isamen koi andeh nahin ki ve or unke sipahasaalar amit shah us shandaar kamyaabi ko dohraane main koi kasar nahin chodenge
 Despite everything that the Congress has right (including the split in the bjp's state unit), no one can predict confidently about the Karnataka elections, the main reason is that Modi is the trump card, Those that cannot be said beforehand, and they can turn around in an unexpected way

 The Gujarat election had shown that the BJP was beginning to rely more heavily on the charisma of the Prime Minister to counter the diminishing benefits of being in power
 is baat ko lekar atakalon or afvaahon kaa bazaar garm he ki aam chunaav is saal ke aakhir karwaae ja sakate hai taaki unheen dinon hone vaale rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh ke rajya chunaavon ke saath-saath karwaae ja saken
 The reasoning behind this is that the damage that Vasundhara Raje and Shivraj Singh Chauhan may have to face as a seat in the separately conducted elections can be offset by Modi's zealous election rallies
 rajasthan iskaa maujuun udhaaharan he
 This province under Vasundhara Raje has been a laboratory of a variety of right-wing economic policies and self-styled Hindu cow protectionism
 congress ko yahaan abhi pahaad chadhvaa he; pichley vidhansabha chunaav main yah rajasthan vidhansabha main dayaneey 21 siton tak simat gai thi, par skulon kii alokapriy bandi, saamaajik or saamudayik sevaaon par bajet kii rakamon kaa kharch na hona or dambhi tathaa vibhaajankaree mukhyamantri ne vipaksh ke haathon main ek siyaasi mauka thama diya he
 This year, when all the leaves — that is, the power of the organization, the money and resources that are achieved by being the ruling party at the center and in many states, the Prime Minister's charismatic ability to turn political winds in its favor — remain in the hands of the BJP In such a situation, the opposition, especially the Congress, will have to play well with whatever cards are in its hands to avoid annihilation
 agar vah isamen naakaam rahati he, to agle aam chunaav main bhaajapa kii pehle se ujali sambhaavnaaon main vilakshan oochaal aa jayega
 It would be appropriate for the BJP to put forth the political results of a good election year, even taking the risk of seeming unnecessarily disastrous
 agar bhaajapa 2018 kaa ant hindustan ke 29 main se 22 suubon main gaddinshin party ke taur par karti he, to vah rajyasabha main do-tihaai bahumat ke kareeb hogi
 After that, if it even surpasses its 2014 performance in the 2019 general elections, it could be close to the special majority needed to amend the constitution, certainly predictable by any political observer in 2014
 Were closer than ever
 is baat kii zyada sambhaavna nahin he ki bhaajapa 2019 main loksabhaa main do-tihaai bahumat hasil kar legi, lekin zyada sambhaavna nahin hone kaa matlab is baat kaa ghor avishsaneey hona bhi nahin he
 In 2014 there was not much possibility that the party with five state governments would become the ruling party in 19 states within less than three and a half years, but it happened
 uske samarthak or dushman, donon maanate hai ki bhaajapa or uskaa vaicharik janak aresas shabdashah bharat kaa samvidhan nae sire se gande ke liye patibaddh he
 When bjp's five-time MP from Karnataka Anant Kumar Hegde declared that "we are here to change the constitution", people took notice of him despite his party's refusal and his own apology
 yogi adityanath ko hindustan ke sabase zyada aabaadi vaale rajya ke mukhyamantri ke ohade par asin karke narendra modi ne notice de diya he ki bhaajapa kii siyaasi pariyojna haashiye ke tatwon ko mukhyadhara main laana he or jiske bare main sochaa bhi na ja sake, use aam dharre kii baat bananaa he
 There should be nothing surprising in the notion that the BJP and its allies formally want to revitalize the Republic; This is the real reason for the Hindu Rashtra project

 In fact, while discussing the 'indian Council of Medical Sciences (amendment) Bill 2019' in the House, Kakoli Ghosh of Trinamool Congress was speaking, while sitting in the back seat, Burke was reading the newspaper

 According to sources, the then Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Defense had refused to put forward the Cabinet note for the purchase of 36 Rafale aircraft and commented on the dissent note
 lekin unke is note ko khaarij karte hue cabinet note ko aage badha diya gaya
 His descent note was about the benchmark price
 ek varg benchmark keemat 500 karod euro tay karnaa chahta tha, lekin is baithak main antat: saude kii benchmark keemat 820 karod euro tay kii gai
 But when the cabinet note was moved forward approving the purchase of the aircraft on its basis, an officer went on leave to protest against it
 sarkaar ne france ke saath hue deal kii sharton ke mutabik in aankadon kaa khulaasa nahin kiya he
 But now, given the situation of much controversy in this country, the government can urge the French government to make the figures public
 katar ko sasta vimaan milane par vaayu sena kaa kahana he ki uskaa france ke saath koi ofaset samjhauta nahin he or usne sirf basic aircraft lene kaa sauda kiya he
 According to the bargain, UPS government was supposed to get 18 flight condition aircraft at the rate of Rs 688 crore per aircraft
 upie sarkaar ne 126 ladaaku vimaanon ke liye sauda kiya tha
 Out of this, 18 flyways ie aircraft ready to fly were to be charged at a price of Rs 688 crores per aircraft
 108 vimaan echeel main banane the or yah prati vimaan 911 karod rupee ke hisaab se milte, jisamen ofaset bhi shaamil tha
 In the year 2013, Euro Fighter talked about 20% discount on some things, but due to delay in orders and adding inflation etc
, the price of Rafale was not reduced
 is baat par hua france se matbhedsaal 2014 main baatcheet kaa silsilaa tut gaya, kyonki is baat par vivaad tha ki bharat main 108 vimaan banane ke liye kitne maanav ghante shram kii jarurat hogi

 In the same year, India canceled the old contract and started talks afresh

 The basic price of 36 aircraft, according to the purchase of 18 aircraft of UPA round 950
 3 karod euro hoti thi, lekin modi sarkaar ne baatcheet kar isaki antim keemat sirf 788
 9 million euros fixed
 isamen se bhi france 50 fisadi ofaset ke liye nirdhaarit karne par raji hua, yani vah iskaa 50 fisadi bharat main nivesh karegaa
 The Government of India also says that within this price, 13 changes have to be made in the aircraft according to the needs of India

 'india has not won any Test series in South Africa so far
 rajput ne kaha, yah aisi team he jo chamatkaar kar sakati he or mujhe ummid he ki ve dakshin africa main kaaphi acha pradarshan karenge
 According to Rajput, Indian bowlers have the ability to take 20 wickets from South Africa, which is mandatory to bring the result in the team's favor
 rohit bole- hamen videshon main bhi apana yahi pradarshan barkaraar rakhana hogounhone kaha, test match jeetne ke liye hamen 20 wicket lene kii jarurat he
 We have bowlers who can take 20 South African wickets
 bhubaneshwar kumaar top form main hai, umesh ne shandaar pradarshan kiya he, chot ke baad mohammad shami behtareen gendbaaji kar rahaa he

 He said, if you want to take 20 wickets then you should have five bowlers

 Rajput advised India's Test vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane, who struggles with poor form against Sri Lanka, to spend more time at the crease
 hamaare kendriya grih mantri pi
 Chidambaram is well aware that due to the general elections held in May 2009, he has very little time left to do anything in the name of achievement
 yadi ve aisa kar pate hai to yah ek lihaaj se sanyog hi hoga
 The reason is that what India needs after the Mumbai attacks is to take action and that too immediately
 mahaj ek maheenaa pehle hi grih mantralay kii kaman thaamne vaale chidambaram ne 6 janvari ko aantarik suraksha ko lekar bulaai gai mukhyamantriyon kii baithak main kaha ki unki fori praathamikta dinodin atyaadhunik hote ja rahe aatankwaadi khataron se nibatane ke liye taiyaariyon ke str ko badhanaa he
 But they should also remember that it is equally important to take immediate and decisive action after a terrorist threat or attack
 desh main aatmavishvaas kaa phir se sanchaar karne ke liye ye donon kadam bahut mahatvapurn hai
 After the Mumbai attacks, this confidence was dealt a tremendous blow
 lekin chidambaram ne apane or apni sarkaar ke liye jo kadaa agenda taiyaar kiya he, us par amal karnaa shuru karne ke saath-saath unhen apane mantralay ke kaamkaaj kii or adhik baariki se samiksha karne kii jarurat he
 If the fight against terror is to be taken to victory, the Union Home Ministry will have to play a very important role
 lekin pichley kuch varshon main desh kii aantarik suraksha ke prabandhan ko jo rog laga hua he, yah mantralay uskaa sateek udhaaharan he
 Six months before the Mumbai attacks, bombings occurred in Delhi, Jaipur, Bangalore Ahmedabad and Guwahati, killing 215 people and injuring 1,000
 in hamalon ke baad hameshaa kii tarah hi 'suraksha ko lekar samiksha' kii khatir kai baithken huin, jinamein ek se duusare adhikari par aarope-pratyarope kaa silsilaa chalata rahaa or kisi kii javabdehi tay nahin kii gai
 At the same time these rote instructions were sent to the states to tighten their security and after that there was no need to know what progress has been made in this matter
 mumbai hamalon ke baad yah spasht ho gaya tha ki grih mantralay ko apane drushtikon main krantikari badlaav laane kii jarurat he
 There are many cases under it at this time
 aantarik suraksha or aatankwaad ke alaava iske kaamkaaj main jammu-kashmir or uttar-purvi rajyon main baghawat, vampanthi ugravad, seemaa prabandhan, apravasana, videshi paisa, centre-rajya sambandh, centreshasit kshetra, bhartiya police seva (ipies) or kendriya arddh-sainik balon kaa prabandhan, police aadhunikeekaran or niti niyojan shaamil hai
 Experts say that in the last few years this ministry has become such a giant, which has become difficult to handle
 nateeja yah he ki usne police ke aadhunikeekaran sareekhe mahatvapurn sujhavon ko latakaae rakhaa he, vah na to centre main or na hi rajya str par khufia agenciyon ke adhikaar kshetra kii ladaai sulajhane kii disha main koi kadam uthaa paaya he
 Apart from this, it also failed to formulate an effective anti-terrorism policy
 9 / 11 ke baad america main jorge bush prashasan ne faisla kiya tha ki use ek mahatvapurn homeland security department kii jarurat he, jisase america raashtrapati kii raay main, ''america adhik surakshit banegaa kyonki hamaare raashtra main ek aisa vibhaag hoga jiskaa makasad america homeland kii raksha karnaa he
 "bush decided that there would be only one department to protect America's border, the transportation sector, ports, and important sites
" iske alaava uske paas vibhinn stroton se praapt desh kii khufia suraksha jaankaree ko jutaney or uskaa vishleshan karne, sarvapratham aakankshiyon ko prashikshit kar unhen hathiyaaron se las karne or sangheey str par apaat kaal ke prabandhan kaa kaam hoga
 Obviously, India can also learn a lot from the security review of its country of America
 is tathy ke maddenjar ki bharat main naukarshahi main zyada baadhaaen paidaa karne kii pravriti he, samasya kaa samaadhaan shaayad yah he ki grih mantralay ke duusare kaaryon se aantarik suraksha ko alag kar diya jaae
 The US Homeland Security Department does not carry out police modernization, procurement of goods and other executive functions
 isliye agar bharat main bhi aantarik suraksha ke liye purnakalik cabinet mantri bana diya jaae to shaayad samasya sulajhane main madad hi milegi
 It will not have any relation with the Ministry of Home Affairs
 grih mantralay kii kursi sanbhaalane ke thode din baad hi chindbaram ne ek neshnal investegative agency kaa gathan karwaane kii karrwai shuru kar di
 The agency will investigate terrorist cases across the country, with the Home Minister also ensuring information sharing and better coordination between intelligence agencies by reactivating the multi-agency Center (MAC) and making it accountable
 aatank ko rokane ke liye ab puraa jor guptchar sansthaaon ke bich adhik samanvay or jaankaree ke aadan-pradaan par hi diya ja rahaa he
 Chidambaram has also approved the long-pending and much needed equipment bulletproof jackets and rifles for paramilitary forces, bypassing the red-tape
 nishchay hi in kadamon se bahut antar padegaa
 But it is equally important to bring about basic infrastructure and personnel changes in the Ministry of Home Affairs
 or badlaav kii shuruyaat iske sheersh par baithe logon se ho sakati he
 Of the eight special and additional secretaries and 20 joint secretaries in the ministry, only two are professionally police officers
 sachiv madhukar gupta se shuru karen to lagbhag sabhi mahatvapurn padon par iees adhikari hi baithe hai jinhen suraksha muddon se nibatane kaa jaraa bhar anubhav nahin he
 All officers handling important matters like Kashmir, north-east, Naxalites and Border Management have come from the Administrative Services
 aadhunikeekaran ke kaarykram ko sabase adhik nuksaan isliye pahunchaa he ki uske prabharee adhiktar adhikariyon main is maamle main gyaan or field anubhav kaa abhaav he
 This imbalance needs to be corrected immediately
 aatanrik suraksha vibhaag ko visheshgyon kii aisi sanstha main tabdeel kiye jane kii jarurat he jo aatankwaad, baghawat or seemaa par avaidh ghuspaith se nibatane main sakasham ho
 Apart from this, there are many other priority issues which need to be looked into by the Ministry of Home Affairs
 philhal aisi koi vyavastha maujuud nahin he, jo avaidh ghuspaithiyon kii pahchaan kar unhen desh se baahar kar sake
 Efforts were initiated to issue Multi-purpose National Identity Cards (mnics) to legitimate citizens of the country since 2002 with the aim of increasing national security, managing citizen identity and facilitating e-governance
 tab 5,000 karod ru
 So far in the first phase of this important scheme with an estimated budget of Rs
 12, the government has been able to issue only 12 lakh identity cards
 passport, rashan card yaa kisi or dastavej kii bajaae in cardon ko hi pahchaan kaa buniyadi dastavej mana janaa chahie
 According to government sources, the project has become entangled in the battle of jurisdiction of several ministries
 in mantralayon main soochna or praudyogiki, grih mantralay or chunaav ayog shaamil hai
 mnics should be issued to all citizens within a certain period of time
 rashan card, passport, driving license athwa pan card kii bajaae yah card naagarik kii pahchaan sthapit karne kaa pukhta dastavej hona chahie
 The lull in retaliation by the police and security personnel during the Mumbai attacks was quite visible
 jarurat is baat kii he ki vartmaan police balon ko chust-durust banane ke liye tatkaal paisa muhaiyaa karaayaa jaae
 1,300 crore for modernization of state police forces in 2008-09 by the Ministry of Home Affairs
 kaa praavdhaan rakhaa he
 In the last five years, this amount has almost doubled
 yah paisa ek se duusari jagah par police javaanon kii aasaani se awajahi, aadhunik hathiyaaron, sanchaar pranali, prashikshan, buniyadi suvidhaon, aparaadh vigyaan kii prayogshaalaon, khufia shakhaon kii majbootee, suraksha upkarnon, thana bhawanon kaa nirmaan karne or nichle str ke pulicekarmiyon ke liye awasaiya bhawan banane main kharch kiye jane ke liye rakhaa gaya he
 The problem is that there is no accountability of the states or, say, the Center
 is tathy kii jaanch karne yaa yah dekhne ke liye bhi koi vyavastha nahin he ki rajya us paise ko lekar kya kar rahe hai
 The Ministry of Home Affairs should conduct its annual audit, under which senior officials themselves go to those states to investigate and observe how the states are using the money given for modernization
 isse mantralay main vibhinn sachivon or sanyukt sachivon ke str par javabdehi kii vyavastha bhi lagu hogi
 There is also a need to implement a lossless system of deciding responsibility
 mumbai par aatankwaadi hamalon ke baad vibhinn agenciyon or adhikariyon kii pratikriya jaani-pahachaani thi-ibi se lekar ro or nausena or coast guard (tat rakshak) tak ne ek-duusare par aarope-pratyarope kaa silsilaa shuru kar diya
 So far it has not been decided who and where the mistake was made
 ab tak javabdehi nirdhaarit kar di jaani chahie thi or kuch logon kii gardan bhi naap di jaani chahie thi
 Ideally, a time-bound Commission of Inquiry should have been set up to see where the mistake occurred and why the attack could not be stopped
 iske alaava use yah bhi sochna chahie tha ki aise hamalon ko rokane ke liye kya kiya ja saktaa he
 This is what happened in America after 9 / 11
 kisi ko bhi na bakhshate hue ayog ko un adhikariyon ke khilaaf karrwai kerani chahie jo apane kartavya ke paalan main shithil paae gaye
 Under this, all agencies including IB, RAW, Maharashtra Police, Navy and Coast Guard will come
 yahaan tak ki jarurat padane par raajnneetikon se bhi jawaab talab kiya janaa chahie
 Unless strict steps are taken, the Ministry of Home Affairs will continue to be caught in crisis from one to another and India will continue to bear its brunt

 patna main 29 june ko hardik patel ne "patel jaagrukta sammelan'' main rajya kii ati pichhadi jatiyon (ibisi)—kurmi, dhanuk or kushvaha—ko ekajute hone kaa aahvaan kiya
 The Patidar leader of Gujarat, Hardik, reached the house of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav shortly thereafter, who these days is trying hard to dent the backward voters
 sau se zyada jatiyon ko milaakaar bane ati pichhadaa varg ke votaron kii taadaad bihar main kareeb 33 fisadi he
 The state has around five per cent population of Kushwaha and is the second largest caste class after the Yadavas
 tejasvi aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav kii ranneeti main is varg ko bahut ahm maan rahe hai or ise apane paale main karne ko bekaraar hai
 The signs of two young leaders, Tejashwi and Hardik coming together are clear
 rajd kisi bhi surat main us ibisi vot bank main sendhamari karnaa chaahati he jo ab tak nitish kumaar kaa majboot aadhaar rahaa he
 RJD leaders say that attempts to woo Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha (rashtriya Lok Samata Party president and NDA ally who are being said to be angry with BJP for seat sharing for 2019) have not shown much color yet Pai, so now Tejashwi turns to Hardik
 gujarat ke patelon ko bihar ke kurmiyon ke baraabar hi mana jaataa he or nitish kumaar isi jati se aate hai
 Clearly, Nitish's fiercest critics are considering Hardik's role in Bihar in the Lok Sabha elections
 bihar main 2014 kii loksabhaa kii 40 siton main se 31 siten endie kii jholii main gai thim
 The NDA currently has 33 seats in Bihar, including two JD (U) seats
 2019 main bhaajapa ko satta virdohi maahaul kaa saamana to karnaa hi padegaa, saath hi saath nitish ke saath siton ke bantwaare ko lekar bhi pech fansega
 Since 2006, Nitish Kumar had reserved 20 percent seats in the panchayat elections for the ebcs
 tab se is vot bank par unki majboot pakad bani hui he
 That one decision changed the course of politics in rural Bihar and panchayats, which were once dominated by the upper castes and the dominant backward castes
 iskaa nateeja hua ki ati pichhadon ne aapasi jaateey matbhedon ko bhulaakar nitish kaa khulkar saath diya or 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaavon tathaa 2010 or 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main nitish kii jeet sunishchit karai
 If Lalu Prasad Yadav's own caste base (14 per cent) and the 16 per cent Muslim vote of the state together could not stop Nitish's chariot, then one of the main reasons for this was that the most backward also unitedly stayed with Nitish
 And the pan became even
 ho saktaa he ki loksabhaa chunaav main nitish kaa koi khaas asar na ho lekin unki maujuudagi ahm he
 It is no surprise that after Tejashwi's statement that the grand alliance doors were closed forever for Nitish, the Congress immediately started trying to smuggle in on it
 congress ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai ki mahagathbandhan ke vistaar kii har sambhaavna kaa swaagat hona chahie
 He said, "both Rahul Gandhi and Lalu Yadav are mature
 hamaara pehla lakshya he bhaajapa ko haraana
 If Nitish Kumar wants to come then he should be welcome
 ''congress ke netaa shakeel ahamed khan ne kaha ki jab bhaajapa ke khilaaf dalon kaa ek mahagathbandhan banataa dikh rahaa he, us samay sabhi ko apana dil bada rakhane kii jarurat he
 However, JD (U) has officially denied the statements of Congress

 State Lokayukta Justice ML Tahaliyani dismissed the complaint against Khadse, giving a clean chit to Khadse while acquitting his PPA Gajanan Patil bribery scandal
 lokayukta ne is bare main purv mantri ke khilaaf kii gai shikaayat ko bhi khaarij kar diya
 The verdict states that the former minister has no role in seeking bribes from the PA

 So this case is closed
 'asibi ne pehle hi di thi clin chitisse pehle asibi ne bhi is maamle main khadse ko clin chit de di thi
 In its report submitted to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, the ACB had said that there was no such evidence in the investigation to prove that Khadse had any connection with the matter of demanding bribe

 supreme court ke dwaara hive par sharaab kii briki ko lekar lagaai gai roak se adhiktar rajya sarkarein pareshaan hai
 The court ordered that liquor should not be sold in the 500 meters of the highway and its surroundings, and all liquor shops should be closed
 lekin ab adhiktar rajya sarkarein iskaa upaay khojane main lag chuki hai
 State governments, restaurant owners and liquor salesmen have taken a decision on this
 rajmargon se vaapis liya hive kaa darjibhi tak rajasthan, madhyapradesh, uttar pradesh or chandigarh ke rajmargon ko dinotiphoi kar diya gaya he, or anya rajya kii sarkarein bhi jald aisa kar sakati hai
 By doing this, these highways will not have the status of highways, and all of them will not be able to come under the order of the Supreme Court
 jisase sharaab kii dukaanon ko koi pareshaani nahin hogi
 Maharashtra, Bengal are also preparing to do so, apart from these states, the bjp-shiv Sena government of Maharashtra can do it soon, while the Mamta Banerjee government of West Bengal is also planning to do this
 uttar pradesh main kai jagah aisi bhi hai jahaan sharaab kii dukaanon ko hive se lagbhag 500 meter se zyada kii duuri par shift kar diya gaya he
 In the order issued by the UP government on March 31, the bypass of the state highway has now been declared a district route
 baar or restaraan waalon ne bhi lagaaya jugadrajya sarkaron ke saath-saath is daayre main aane vaale baar or restaraan waalon ne bhi kai jugad lagane shuru kar diye hai
 Bar-restaurants near the highway are changing their entry gate, so that they will come out 500 meters away
 ab palikaayen sanbhaalengi sadakenrajya sarkaron dwaara sabhi rajya margon ko jila maarg banaaye jane ke baad ab inkaa jimmaa shahar kii nagar palikaon par aa jayega
 Since earlier all these highways were directly under the state government, but now it will come under the municipalities
 paison kaa he sawalgauratlab he ki sharaab ke dwaara rajya sarkaron ko sabase zyada tex miltaa he
 This is the reason that most of the state governments are engaged in this jugaad that somehow the sale of liquor can be saved
 taaki rajya ke rajasav par koi asar naa pade

 bhartiya raajnneeti main resort poltics ek saamaanya baat ho gai he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) once used this formula to save and form the government, but in the changed circumstances, this strategy has become a compulsion even for the scared Congress

 Speaking of Sir Viv Richards, 'I like Virat Kohli's aggressive style', he also described Australia as a strong team and claimed him to win the title
 viv (viv Richards) ne kaha ki australia shandaar team he
 So i think these are four to five teams that have the potential to win the 2019 World Cup
 'westeindies ke bare main poochne par richards ne kaha ki team ne haal ke varshon main apni sarvshereshth farm nahin dikhaai he or unhone ummid jataai ki team ek baar phir sheersh par pahonchegi
 This Australian batsman breaks 33-year-old record of great Viv Richards world cap se pehle har cricket premi ke paas umesh yadav ke liye suzav the
 Some cricket experts also believed that Team India management should think seriously on the selection of this player
 par dhoni ne is gendbaaj par bharosa dikhaaya or umesh yadav semifinal main usapar khare bhi utre
 Century Joot Smith did the Indians in Umesh Yadav in the final match, Umesh Yadav took 4 wickets after spending 72 runs in 9 overs
 bhale hi ikonimi rate ke maamle main wo pichad gaye par ahm maukon par wicket jhatkar unhone bhartiya team kii match main vaapasi karai

 Smith and Finch then broke the 182-run partnership for the second wicket for Australia
 unhone smith ko 105 ran par chalata kiya
 Umesh Yadav also returned the pavilion to Aaron Finch and James Faulkner
 agar umesh yadav acchhee gendbaaji nahin karte to australia 350 kaa score pakkaa paar karata
 His precise bowling in the second spell somewhat reduced the problems for the Indian team
 aaj release hui film 'jigariyaa' ek lav story he
 
 
 This is the story of Shamlal alias Shamu, a young student living in Agra, who has failed in education and is fond of poetry
 
 
 uskaa khandaani pesha barason se halwai kaa he, magar vah lekhak bananaa chahta he
 
 
 One day he suddenly collides, with a girl he falls in love with, and then begins, Ishq's bickering, romance, the difference between the grown-ups for marriage, and then Tragedy
 
 
 darasal, ek maasoom-si lav story he film 'jigariyaa', jisamen bahut sundar drishy hai, khubasurat photography he, or sabase khaas baat yah he ki film main desh kii sundarataa ko darshaya gaya he
 
 
 While watching the film, i remembered 'ranjhana' in many places
 
 
 haalanki donon filmon kii kahani bahut alag hai, lekin jis tarah us film main ek chote-se parivaar kaa ladkaa tha or ladki ke peeche padataa he, vaise hi is film main agra ke ladke kii kahani ko vaise hi luk main dikhaane kii koshish kii gai he
 The music of 'jigariya' is also similar to 'ranjhana', and the film has the same passion, for love
 
 
 magar 'ranjhna' jaise 'muments' nahin hai 'jigariyaa' main
 
 
 Seeing it just felt like trying to create a new story 'raanjhana' by choosing a different story
 
 
 haalanki 'jigariyaa' kii lavastory main maasoomiyat dikhti he, magar film kuch dhimi he
 
 
 Raj Purohit's direction is also fine, but the story seems to go astray
 
 
 film main maasoom-si ladki ke kirdaar main shairi maradia jami hai, vahiin shaamu ke role main harshavardhan dev thode anfit lage, yaa yun kahie, pataa chalata he ki kalakaar nayaa he, or anubhav kii kami saaf jhalkati he parde par
 
 
 Overall 'jigariya' is a lovely lovestory, once again reflecting the color of Ishq of agra-mathura, one of India's many colors
 
 
 is film ko ek baar dekha ja saktaa he, or is film ke liye meri reating he - 3 star
 
 
 In the TV show 'saath Nibhana Sathiya', Gopi is not taking the name of the problems being reduced

 vahiin duusari taraf ahm apane damaad aani ki gaura ke bete dharam par apana gussa nikaal detaa he lekin dharam is baar apni maa kaa nahin detaa or vah modi parivaar ko apni maa kaa sara sach bataa detaa he
 In the upcoming episode, Ahmad Modi will die while saving his family and in the same episode Dharam's first wife will also embrace death

 Kohli however could not lead the team to the playoffs once again this season

 When you have to face David Warner and Yuzvendra Chahal, then you have to strategize
 maan ke chaliye ki yah donon 33 baar aamane-saamne hue, ab aap isamen se kuch ranneeti banaaenge
 i think this thing is going to grow over time

 a post shared by Taimur Ali Khan (@beingtaimur) on Dec 20, 2018 at 3:23am PST Amidst all the claims of reform, the negligence of the railways is revealed once again
 11 ghante tak train ke toilet main fansaa rahaa bujurg mahila kaa pair
 At the Ratnagiri railway station, toilets had to be cut by gas cutters
 konkan kanya express main haadasachalati train main shauchalay kaa istemaal kar rahi ek bujurg mahila kii jaan saansat main tab funs gai jab vah baahar nikalne ke liye aage badi or paanv phisal gaya
 The woman's leg got stuck in a desi style dress
 ye vakya 11 disambar ko 10111 down konkan kanya express main hua
 Rubyabi Sheikh, a 65-year-old veteran woman living in Ghatkopar, was traveling from Mumbai to Karmali in the S-10 coach of the train with her husband Kasam Sheikh
 khed or chiplun ke bich is mahila ne shauchalay se baahar aate samay jaise hi darwaja kholaa vah phisal gai or unka pair bhartiya style ke camod main funs gaya
 The family were left stunned to hear their shouting, their husbands who stayed outside the toilet were frightened and they informed the other passengers about the incident
 rubiabi shaikh dard ke maare cheekh rahi thi or madad kii guhaar laga rah thi
 But the helpless Kasam Shaikh was unable to do anything because the door of the toilet was closed from inside and it was not on anyone's ability to open or break it
 darwaja todaa gayaphir tisi or duusare railway karmchaariyon kii madad se daravaaje aavashyak sahaayta ke rup main shauchalay kaa darwaja bhi nikaala gaya
 But the situation inside was even more shocking
 rubiabi shaikh kaa ek pair railway camod ke andar ghusaa hua tha or wo pair buree tarah se fansaa hua tha
 All attempts fail, however
 si
 , Coach assistant and other passengers also tried to pull him but could not be ejected
 sabhi sambhav prayaas or sadhano kaa upyog karne ke baavjood bhi gaadi chiplun se guzarane tak koi safalataa nahin mili
 The commode was cut at Ratnagiri station
 After about one and a half hours, when the train reached Ratnagiri, the Regional Railway Manager, B
R
 bi
 Nikam, along with doctors, officers and staff arrived in the car to evacuate the woman in distress
 phir bhi mahila ko baahar nahin nikaala ja sakaa
 Therefore, it was decided to disassemble the coach by boarding the passengers in the other coach and cutting the Indian-style commode with the help of a cutter without carefully injuring the woman
 mahila ke pair main sujanis haadase main mahila ke pair main sujan aayi hui thi phir bhi ant main mahila ko surakshit nikaala gaya or nivarak upaay ke rup main aage kii jaanch ke liye civil aspataal, ratnagiri le jaaya gaya
 On this entire incident, the Konkan Railway says that it was an accident and their officials left no stone unturned to protect the victim's woman
 amitabh bachchan ke donon bachche, shweta or abhishek kis tarah rakshabandhan manaaya karte the
 How the two used to have quarrels and what Abhishek Bachchan used to ask from his heart in childhood - one Shweta Bachchan Nanda has told about this openly
 shweta kii maane to in donon membhishekazyada shararti the or shweta ko kaaphi tang kiya karte the
 However, in this case, Abhishek has not improved even today and teases him a lot by manipulating Shweta's pictures in the family Kavotsapp group, which has around 80 members
 vahiin bachapan membhishek bachchanane ek baar chupake se car chalaai thi
 When Shweta came to know about this, she used this secret of Abhishek as a weapon
 iske baad se jab bhobhishekaunako tang karte to vah car chalaane vaali baat mummy-papa ko bataane kii dhamkee dekar unako vahiin roak detii thim
 At the same time, Shweta has written in the column of DNA that Abhishek had a desire to grow up as a younger brother
 tabhi jab bhi unki palak kaa koi bal tuutata tha to ve ankhen bandakar ke use phoonk se udaakar yahi vish karte the ki unka ek chota bhai is duniya main aa jaae
 Shwetane has written that as such she is two years older than her brother and has reserved nature compared to Abhishek
 yahi vajah he ki vah abhishek se zyada jhagada nahin kar paati thim jiske chalate abhishek ne unako aise dominete kiya jaise wo choti bahan hon
 Of course, the relationship between brother and sister is as beautiful as Shweta! vitt mantri arun jetali ne daawa kiya ki ab log apana tex ritern online bhar rahe hai
 Refunds and its information are also being given to traders through online mediums
 jetali ne vishwaas jataayaa ki yadi technology kaa upyog sahi tareeke se kiya gaya to bharat ko vaishvik aarthik map par ubharne se koi nahin roak saktaa he
 In the India Today Conclave, the Finance Minister said that if one has to register his company today, he will not have to face problems
 yah kaam online madhyamon se kuch farm bharne athwa pahchaan patr pesh karne se puraa kar liya jayega
 At the same time, the biggest benefit from this step will be that the central government will be able to bring the maximum benefit of its schemes to the poor people of the country

 New currency communication worked at a rapid pace
 The Finance Minister said that after the important decisions like demonetisation, there was hope for some turmoil in the economy
 lekin kendra sarkaar ne desh kii 85 fisadi mudra ko badalane ke baad tej gati se nai mudra ke sanchaar kaa kaam kiya
 According to Jaitley, if the communication of the new currency was not completed in a few weeks, there was a crisis for the economy, but the central government has shown good momentum in this direction
 notebandi ke faisle ko uchit tehraate hue jetali ne kaha ki logon kaa daawa tha ki isse agriculture iconomi ko tagada jhatka lagegaa lekin maujuuda aankade saaf kar rahe hai ki notebandi ke asar se isiconomi ne raftaar pakad liyaahai
 On the question of further reduction in tax rates under GST, Jaitley said that it is possible that the GST Council is expected to cut in the coming days
 jahaan ummid he vahaan kuch katautee kaa elaan kiya ja saktaa he
 With this, Jaitley claimed that PMI figures have been positive in the last 2-3 months after the introduction of demonetisation and GST
 iske alaava desh main industrial production or kor sector ke aankade bhi positive rahe hai
 These figures clearly indicate that the country's economy is ready to grow at a fast pace after these reforms
