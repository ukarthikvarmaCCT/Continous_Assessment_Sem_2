shani jayanti kaa ye parv is baar shanivaar ko padaa he
 On one hand, where Saturn Jayanti is lying on Saturday, on this day, 8th date
 8 ank shani kaa ank mana jaataa he jisamen shani kii samast shaktiyaan samahit hoti hai
 On this day, along with Sarvartha Siddhi and Amrit Yoga, a wonderful combination of Rohini Nakshatra is also being formed after many years
 jyotishacharyon ke anusaar, is din shani se prabhavit jaatakon ko puja kaa vishesh laabh milegaa
 How will Saturn bring happiness? The astrologers say that if you donate to Saturn and chant some mantras on this jubilee, it will help in getting rid of rising debts
 shatruon par vijay milegi or ji kaa janjaal ban chuki bimaariyaan thik hone lagengi
 Those who are troubled by the effects of Sathasati, Dhaiyya as well as the Mahadasha of Saturn and the negative effects of Saturn in the horoscope or birth chart, they will get relief from the anointing of Shani Dev with oil on Shani Jayanti
 kehane ko to shanidev suryaputra hai lekin pita surya se shani kii kabhi nahin bani
 Not only this, Shani Dev had to face the wrath of mother even once
 jiske baad shanidev kii chaal hi badal gayi
 Shani, the god of justice, Shani, the god of Kalyug, Shani who frightens everyone with his crooked gait, and Shani Maharaj, who is pleased with mustard oil, is considered very important in Vedic astrology
 sanathan dharm main shani kii ahmiyat kaa andaaza aap isi baat se laga sakate hai ki shani ko sirf grah nahin, balki devtaa mana jaataa he or devtaa bhi nyaay kaa
 According to mythology, Surya's wife Chhaya gave birth to a son on Saturday's Amavasya in Jyestha month
 jinka naam rakhaa gaya- shani
 When Sun came to see his son, the color of Saturn turned black by scorching his glory
 surya ko apni is galati kaa ehsaas hua lekin tab tak bahut der ho gai thi or iskaa parinaam surya ko turant bhugatna padaa
 All of the Sun's light was blurred as soon as he saw his son Shani
 surya ko grahan lag gaya, lekin kehete hai tab se shani kaa rang hameshaa ke liye kaala ho gaya
 Not only the black color of Saturn, the story of his crooked gait is also very unique
 kehete hai ki ye kahani shani maharaj ke gussell swabhaav se judi hui he
 It is said that when Shani was a child, he asked for food from his mother Chhaya
 bhojan milane main deree hui to gusse main unhone chaaya ko laat maar diya
 The angry shadow of Saturn cursed them to be lame
 kehete hai tabhi se shani kii chaal tedi ho gai or unka khauf or bad gaya
 But learning from his mistakes, Shani Dev took this vow that if anyone lied in the Kali Yuga or did any injustice to anyone, then he would be the victim of the wrath of Shani
 yahi vajah he ki unki tedi chaal bhakton ko adharm or anyaay karne se rokatii he
 Who is not afraid of Shani unki vakri drushti kaa khauf to kuch is kadar he ki bhakt unase nazren nahin mila pate
 But if we say that you have this opportunity today, when you ask the god of Kali Yuga to join your eyes and ask for any boon, then believe Saturn will not disappoint you
 ji haa chhindwara main shanidev kaa ek aisa hi mandir he jahaan ankhon main ankhen daalkar bhakt karte hai apane bhagwaan se fariyaad

 petrol-dijal kii badhati keemton main giravat aana shuru ho gai he
 On 6 February in Mumbai where one liter petrol 81
 24 rupee kaa mil rahaa tha
 81 for a liter here on friday
 21 rupee chukaane pad rahe hai
 Petrol-diesel prices in the country have started declining for the last few days
 iske liye antarrashtriya str par kachche tel kii keemton main ai narmi jimmedaar he
 The rise in the prices of crude oil in the international market has put a break
 kachche tel main lagaataar paanchaven din giravat dekhne ko mil rahi he
 Experts say that its prices can come up to $ 62 per barrel
 agar aisa hota he, topetrol or dijalki lagaataar aasmaan par pahunch rahi keemton par bhi brake lagegaa
 With this, inflation will also be controlled
 visheshgyon ke mutabik yues menkache telka utpaadan badha he
 At the same time, its demand has decreased worldwide
 yahi vajah he ki kachche tel kii keemten lagaataar neeche aa rahi hai
 Brent crude has become 10% cheaper since December 26
 isse kachche tel ke 80 dollar ke paar pahunchane kaa khatra kam ho gaya he
 Along with this, it will also give an opportunity to the Modi government to improve its balance sheet
 aapako milegaa sasta petrountararashtriya str par kachche tel kii keemten ghatane kaa phayda aapako saste petrol or dijal ke taur par milegaa
 Along with this, it will also help in controlling inflation in the country

 On February 6 in Mumbai where people 81 for a liter of petrol
 24 rupee chukaa rahe the
 It has reduced to 80 in the last three days
 21 prati litre par aa gai he
 Crude has got the advantage of being cheaper in the Indian basket
 mahangaai ghategikache tel kii kii ghatati keemton ne modi sarkaar ke liye bhi raahat laane kaa kaam kiya he
 Because of this, the government will be helped in curbing inflation
 vaishvik vittiya santhaan 'UBS' kii ek report ke mutabik jab bhi kachche tel kii keemton main 10 fisadi kii bhi badhotaree hoti he, to isse sipiai inflation main 25 basis point kii badhottaree hone kii ashanka rahati he
 In such a situation, falling prices of crude oil will free the common man as well as the Modi government from the worry of inflation

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting West Asian countries
 jordan ke baad modi aaj philistin ja rahe hai
 Narendra Modi is the first Prime Minister who has also visited Israel and is now reaching Palestine
 philistin 30 saal pehle aaazaad hua tha or bharat un pehle deshon main shaamil tha, jinhone philistin kii aazaadee or samprabhutaa ko manyata di thi
 But so far no PM of the country has reached Palestine
 haalanki, 1960 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru gaja gaye the, lekin tab philistin kaa vajood nahin tha
 The first PME to visit israel-palestine is a strange coincidence that India's relations with Palestine have been very good, but no Prime Minister has bothered to go there before Modi
 ye kuch usee tarah he jaise israel ke 70 saal ke vajood main koi pradhanmantri kabhi israel bhi nahin gaya tha or pichley saal piem modi vahaan gaye, jahaan garmjoshi ke saath unka swaagat satkar kiya gaya
 Not only that, just six months after this, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reached India
 isroyal-philistin kaa khooni sangharceduniya ke itihaas main ye wo do padosi desh hai, jinaki simaaen naa jane kitne nagarikon ke khun se nahaai hai or jo ek duusare ko phooti aankh nahin suhate hai
 There has always been controversy in both countries regarding the Gaza Strip
 lekin ab piem modi ke rup main kam se kam philistin ko to ummid kii kiran dikhaai de rahi he
 Prior to Modi's visit, Palestinian President Mahboob Abbas said that "we are proud of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's historic visit
" ye yatra bharat or isroyal ke logon ke bhaichara vaale sambandhon kii majbootee kaa izhaar karegaa
 We will also talk to Prime Minister Modi on the latest activity of the peace process and the bilateral relations of the two countries
 'yuan main diya philistin kaa sathkuch maheene pehle hi america ne jerusalem ko isroyal kii rajdhani ghoshit kar diya tha
 The declaration was an injury to Palestine's sovereignty and recognition of an independent country
 lekin bharat ne america or isroyal se gahari or gadhi dosti ke baavjood is mudde par philistin kaa saath diya
 At the UN, 128 countries rejected Israel's recognition of Jerusalem, including India
 lekin modi sarkaar ne apane is kadam se isroyal ko bhi naaraaz nahin hone diya
 In January this year, when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited India, he could not see the pain of PM Modi's move
 netanyahu ne apane bayaan main kaha tha ki ek vot se rishte nahin badalte hai
 This Palestine visit of PM Modi highlights more human aspects than diplomacy
 is yatra ke dauraan jin muddon par vahaan baat hogi, unamem swasthya, shiksha, samskruti or mahilaon ko majbootee dene par jor hoga
 Apart from Palestine, PM Modi is also going to Jordan, UAE and Oman in this tour, which is also seen as PM Modi's Arab diplomacy
 in khadi deshon se rishton main majbootee arab deshon main pakistan kii paith kamjor karne main bhi bharat ko madad milegi
 The exercise to form a third front has started, but it seems to be basically to oppose Narendra Modi
 buudhvaar ko dilli main vam dalon kii chhatra chaaya main 14 dalon ne ek baithak kii jise sampradayikta virdohi bataaya gaya
 These parties voiced against communalism and launched a direct attack on bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi
 lekin unhone sattarudh congress ke bare main kuch bhi nahin kaha jabaki kuch dal aise bhi the jo ghor congress virdohi hai
 Interestingly, Sharad Pawar's party NCP also participated in it
 darasal sampradayikta kaa virodh karne ke bahaane vam dalon ne teesraa morcha banane kii kavayad kii he
 The parties that participated in this meeting on Wednesday have 101 seats in the Lok Sabha
 is baithak main kisi bhi dal ne sattarudh congress kii aalochana nahin kii
 He did not talk about burning issues like inflation, corruption
 sabhi dalon ke pratinidhiyon ne sirf bijepi or modi kii aalochana kii
 The most agitated was Nitish Kumar who attacked Modi fiercely
 unhone sabhi partiyon ko sampradayikta, fasiwad maansikta or aatankwaad se ladane kaa aahvaan kiya
 The parties participating in this meeting also tried not to be seen as a group
 ve apni alag pahchaan banaae rakhane to utsuk dikhe
 This means that they want to keep their options open after the Lok Sabha elections so that they can join any front later
 nitish kumaar ne bhi khud ko tisare morche se alag rakhaa
 Sitaram Yechury has also ruled out the immediate possibility of a Third Front
 aapako bataa den ki pichley hafte dilli hai court ne bhi kaha tha ki dilli main bandaron kii sankhya lagaataar badhati ja rahi he
 The court had asked the Delhi government to prepare a plan to get rid of this problem
 iske saath hi hai court ne kendriya paryaavaran mantralay se bhi kaha ki is samasya se nipatane ke liye dilli sarkaar ke liye zaruri dhanrashi kii vyavastha karen
 The Delhi government had said in a status report in the court that it needed about Rs 23 crore 50 lakh to capture and sterilize the 25,000 monkeys of Delhi
 yashavanth sonwane hatyakand main kuch aropiyon ne police ke samaksh apane bayanon main aarope lagaaya he ki adhikari ne jab 25 janvari ko manmaad main tel main milawat hote dekhi to unhone maamle ko nipataane ke liye rishwat kii maang kii
 However, police said such allegations are common
 jaanch adhikari ne hiraasat main band 10 aropiyon ke bayaan darj kiye
 According to the police, the statement of key accused Popat Shinde is yet to be recorded
 popat ke bete kunal scindia ne apane bayaan main aarope lagaaya ki atirikt colector sonwane ne manmaad ke paas sagar dhaba main maamle ko sulajhane ke liye badi rishwat maangi thi
 Nashik Superintendent of Police Milind Bharambe said, 'there are some allegations
 
 But the accused usually make such statements in defense of themselves
 ham sabhi konon se maamle kii jaanch kar rahe hai
 'he said,' These allegations will weaken the case
 main is par or kuch nahin kah saktaa kyonki yah bahut samvedansheel maamla he
 ' vitt mantri arun jetali ne guuruuvaar ko loksabhaa main aam bajet pesh kiya
 This is the last full budget of the Modi government before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 jiesti lagu hone ke baad ye pehla bajet he
 Arun Jaitley spent most of his budget in Hindi

 Given the score around Dhaka's 200, everyone seemed to be struggling but the 'storm' of the de de Villiers made the match completely unilateral

 bhartiya mahila cricket team ne srilanka ko saat wicket se haraaya
 Disappointed with the two-wicket defeat against Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup tournament, Indian captain Virat Kohli said that even though the role of the toss was important, his batsmen should have played smartly
 anbhavi kumaar sangakaara ne 84 gend main 103 ran banaae, jisase srilanka ne madhyakram kii naakaami se ubarte hue romaanchak jeet darj kii
 Kohli said in the post-match press conference, at such places the role of the toss is important, but winning the toss depends on luck
 main apni ballebaaji majboot karnaa chaahunga
 We have to introspect
 unhone kaha, ham chaturaai se khel sakate the
 But if you look at some decisions, close lbw in the first two overs, then we missed a few catches
 yah cricket kaa hissaa he, lekin hamen maukey ganvaane nahin chahie the
 We did not play as smartly as we did against Bangladesh
 ballebaaji main hamen 20-25 ran or banane chahie the
 Kohli justified the decision to give Stuart Binny a place in the team
 unhone kaha, hamaara iraadaa binni ke rup main atirikt ballebaaj ko shaamil karnaa or 10 overon ke liye rohit or rayudu ke saath use gendbaaji saunpane kaa tha, lekin aakhri 10 overon main maidan par kaaphi os thi
 Another character is still missing in the Muzaffarpur girl child case
 vah he madhu
 Her story of Shaista Parveen becoming Madhu is also quite interesting
 philhal vah mujffarpur balika grih balaatkaar maamle main mukhya kirdaar maani ja rahi he
 After Brajesh in the organization, he had the right to decide
 bihar police use khoj nahin pai he
 Now CBI is looking for him
 vah mil jaae to bahut saare raaj khul jaaenge
 Though no FIR is lodged against him, but he is an important link in this entire episode
 brajesh thakurse milane se pehle madhu urf shysta parveen mujffarpur kii badnaam gali chaturbhuj sthaan ilaake main rahati thi
 He had a house in the lantern strip of the same area
 uski shaadi chand mohammad se 1998 main hui thi
 There is also a daughter, but Madhu left her husband after three years due to drug addiction
 usee daur menmujaffarpuramein eespi ke rup main deepika suri kaa tainaat hoti he
 Deepika Suri started the rehabilitation of women trapped in the dirt in the red light area of the city's infamous Gully Lantern Strip, which was discussed all over the country
 unhone kuch ladakiyon ko dallalon ke kaid se aaazaad karaayaa or unke bacchon kii shiksha kii vyavastha kii
 This period was in 2001
 usee daur main brajesh thakur kii mulaakaat madhu se hui
 Madhu and Brajesh together decided to pursue this work in the Red Light area and from there the NGO Seva Salkalp and Vikas Samiti is born
 iske kartadharta brajesh thakur the
 Brajesh Thakur had no problem in working in the red light area due to Madhu
 madhu kumari or brajesh ne milakar 50 mahilaon kaa ek samooh taiyaar kiya
 It also took several schemes from the government in the name of skill development and training of lively hood on the basis of the same group
 uske baad is enjio kaa kaam badhata gaya
 This institution got an opportunity to work in the Red Light area in 2003 from the AIDS Control Society
 isamen mahilaon main aids ko lekar jaagrurata failaane kaa kaam shuru kiya gaya
 The district administration and AIDS Control Society had full cooperation in all these works
 usee dauraan vama shakti vahini ke naam se madhu ne sanstha kii shuruyaat kii thi
 Due to Madhu, Brajesh's influence in the AIDS Control Society increased
 madhu kaa prabhaav is kadar badha ki socity main project ke liye lagaataar baithken hone lageen
 In which Madhu definitely used to come
 dhire dhire madhu or brajesh thakur ke enjio ne aids control socity par ek tarah se niyantran sthapit kar liya
 The influence of the Brajesh and Madhu pair was on the officers that in 2004 an officer is said to have named the organization as the best working organization in Bihar
 lagbhag isi daur main uske chehaton ne uskaa naam madhu rakh diya tha
 His work continued for a long time in AIDS Control Society
 nae nae project nae nae shaharon main milte gaye
 Meanwhile, when the officials of the AIDS Control Society arrived with postings in social welfare, the pair of Madhu and Brajesh started working here as well
 2013 se mukhya rup se balika grih chalaane kaa kaam mila
 Then many projects of Social Welfare Department started getting
 adhikari bhi inke mureed ho gaye
 Meanwhile, the work of AIDS Control Society also continued
 2016 main aids control socity main aae ek adhikari inke prabhaav main nahin aaye to kuch hi dinon main unka tabadalaa ho gaya

 Ishq shop is closed Author: Narendra Sainiprakash: Speech Price: Rs 225
 baat stri-purush prem kii he to deh tak jaaegi hi
 When you get a body along with your mind, love becomes intense
 narendra saini is sachaai ko bakhubi samajhate hai ki muhabbat ke aagaaj kii prerana chaahe jo bhi rahi ho—der-saber pahunchnaa deh tak hi he
 In these stories, with the strength with which he talks about love, the body also with the same strength
 agar ve gaharaai ke saath dil se dil ke rishte kii baat karte hai to sex ke jariye isi rishte ke izhaar ko bhi vistaar dene se jhijakte nahin hai
 By doing this, Narendra not only breaks many taboos but also poses a big danger
 khatra isliye kyonki hindi sahitya main sex aaj bhi varjit he
 Minds have been found in Hindi stories and novels, but there is utter silence on the union of the body
 kuchhek lekhakon ko chhod den to varjana kii is diwaar ko todgaye kii himmat koi nahin juta sakaa lekin unhone apni kahaniyon main bade hi prabhavi dhang se varjana kii is diwaar ko todaa he
 Ishq Shop is closed with a total of eight stories
 sabhi kii nayikaayen bahut hi bahadur, maior or bold hai
 Just like the heroines of Sharatchandra, but the context of her bravery, maturity and boldness has also changed according to the changing times
 jis sharir kii vajah se purush samaaj unhen ''cheez" samajhataa he, usee sharir ko hathiyaar banaakar ve sabak sikhaanaa jaan gai hai (bastard), jis premi ko apane pairon par khadaa karne ke liye vah apana tan-man-dhan sab kuch nyochhavar karti he, vahi premi jab dagaa detaa he to use thukaraane kaa faisla lene main bhi use ek pal nahin lagata (kasak-e-ishk), jab use ehsaas hota he ki sach kii buniyaad par rishte nahin tikte to jhooth kii buniyaad khadi karne main bhi vah khauf nahin khaati (dedline), jis ladke par vah jaan chhidakati thi, vah jab majahab kii taraazoo par rishton ko taulata he to use dhakiyate bhi use der nahin lagati (aaysha), use apane purush mitron ko yah bataane main koi jhijak nahin hoti ki vah lesbian he (ek ladki anjaani si)
 Narendra's heroines prove that "girls are not like condoms" ("A few incomplete diaries" the protagonist of the story considers girls as condoms) They love if they are truly heartbroken She does
 unka samarpan prerit karne vaala he lekin jab vah sabak sikhaane par aati hai to unase zyada khatarnaak or krur shaayad hi koi ho
 She can also drive her lover naked from the house (bastard)
 narendra kii kahaniyon ke nayak aam purush hai
 Men who see only sex in girls
 in kahaniyon main samaaj ke maujuuda samay ke purush hi hai—jinhen chahen aap nayak kah lijie yaa khalanaayak—jinke chehre par mukhauta bhale hi sharafat kaa ho, unki ankhen jism hi tatolti rahati hai
 Narendra's stories have the same character
 har purush ke andar ek safediwala chipa hua he—apane aadim or krur rup main
 Safediwala is the villain who raped a 12-year-old girl (a few incomplete diaries)
 ''aaysha" is sangrah kii ek aisi kahani he, jo ishk ke bahaane samaaj kii sabase krur sachai ko udghaatit karti he
 While eating the body of a girl, her religion does not come in the way, but when one has to drink water from her house, the religion becomes a wall
 ''metro vaali ladki" kahani content or kalpana, donon lihaaj se utkrisht he
 There is an unmatched depiction of the man's desire
 yah kahani yah bhi sandesh detii he ki jab muhabbat jism se hoti he to zyada din nahin tikti
 Urvashi, the heroine of this, says, "now you need a body, not mine
 jisaki tum upeksha kar sako or apane dhang se haank sako
 "the highlight of all the stories in the collection is their climax
 har kahani kaa clymex chaunkaata he

 Subhashree Das, wife of Naxalite leader Sabyasachi Panda, was released from jail on Tuesday after being acquitted by a speedy court in Odisha, but both an Italian citizen and an Odisha legislator are still in the clutches of the Naxalites
 jis das ko mangalvaar ko jail se reeha kiya gaya he, unki rihaai kii maang italy ke ek bandhak kii rihaai ke evaj main naksaliyon ne kii thi
 On the other hand, the deadline given by the Naxalites to the government to fulfill their demands expires on Tuesday evening
 adhikariyon ne kaha ki raigada jile ke gunpur main sthit twarit adaalat ne das ko 2003 main hui ek muthbhed ke maamle main saboot ke abhaav main bari kar diya
 Das was accused of involvement in one of the encounters in Kuttingaguda area
 jail se baahar aane ke baad das ne haalanki kaha ki unki rihaai main sarkaar kii koi bhoomika nahin rahi he
 Das told reporters, "I have been saying since the beginning that i am innocent
 ab meri baat sabit ho gai he
 " garibon or kisaanon kii seva karne ke liye apane pati kii prashansa karte hue das ne kaha ki pandas bhale hi unase dur he, lekin vah unke liye ek mitra, maardarshak or darshanik he
 Das also fears that the police may arrest him again

 Although some believe the release of Das may open the way for the release of an Italian citizen, the release of Biju Janata Dal (BJD) MLA Jhina Hicca is still stuck in the balance

 This includes demands for restrictions on entry of tourists to tribal areas, prohibition of operations against Naxalites, and the release of many prisoners

 Officials said the fast court in Gunpur in Rayagada district acquitted Das for lack of evidence in an encounter case in 2003

 After coming out of jail, Das, however, said that the government had no role in his release
 das ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, "main prarambh se hi kahati aa rahi hum ki main begunaah hum
 Now my point has been proved
 " Praising her husband for serving the poor and farmers, Das said that even though Panda is far from them, she is a friend, guide and philosopher to him

 com / whpj4wot9t The Congress, the country's oldest political party, is currently undergoing a transition
 rahul gandhi kii party adhyaksh kii tajposhi ke baad party main kai tarah ke badlaav dekhe gaye hai
 The political activism of former president Sonia Gandhi has reduced now and Rahul is leading the party by coming to the front foot
 rahul ko party adhyaksh banane kii badhai dete hue sonia gandhi ne kaha he ki 'ab vah unke bhi bos hai'
 Significantly, Rahul Gandhi officially took over as the Congress President on December 16, 2017
 sonia ne apane bayaan main kaha he ki mujhe ummid he ki jis tarah party kaaryakartaaon ne mere adhyaksh rahete kaam kiya, vaise hi rahul kii adhyakshata main kaam karenge
 We have done very well in Gujarat elections and Rajasthan by-elections
 mujhe ummid he ki aane vaale karnataka chunaavon main bhi party shandaar pradarshan karegi
 Sonia also attacked the Modi government and said that it has been four years since this government came to power
 or lagaataar sarkaar kii vajah se loktantr khatre main aayaa he
 It has also impacted Parliament, judiciary, media and society
 sonia ne kaha ki desh main kisaanon kii sthiti kaaphi kharaab hoti ja rahi he
 Sonia also attacked the Modi government fiercely over employment
 pehle diya tha ritair hone kaa bayaanrahul ke adhyaksh banane ke baad sonia ne us dauraan bhi kaha tha ki ab main ritair ho chuki hum
 However, it was later said on behalf of the party that she had retired only as party president and not from politics
 rahul ke party adhyaksh banane ke baad party karyaalay main bada kaarykram kiya gaya tha
 During that time too, Sonia Gandhi had praised Rahul Gandhi fiercely
 sonia ne kaha tha ki vah rahul kii sahansheeltaa par unhen garv he
 Sonia said that i do not want to praise Rahul as a mother
 mujhe rahul kii sahansheeltaa par garv he jisase ve nidar or saahsee bane hai
 On entering politics, Rahul faced such a fierce personal attack that made him more fearless
 unhone kaha ki ek nayaa daur, ek naye netritv kii ummid aapke saamne he
 "let me tell you that Sonia Gandhi was the President of Congress for about 19 years
 sonia 14 march 1998 ko party adhyaksh bani thim
 Let me tell you that since becoming the party president, Rahul Gandhi has taken an aggressive stance
 ab ve pehle se adhik aakraamak hokar modi sarkaar par hamalaa karte hai
 Whether it is through social media, in rallies or by talking to the media, the government has to be surrounded
 rahul kii ranneeti sansad main safalpradhanmantri narendra modi ne buudhvaar ko jab bhaashan diya, us dauraan congress ne ek nai ranneeti par kaam kiya tha
 During the speech, Congress mps suddenly started shouting slogans
 congress ke is ‘flash protest’ ne sabhi ko hairaan kiya
 According to sources, this 'guerrilla style' protest was created by Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 party ke sabhi saansadon ko 12 baje dopaher tak loksabhaa pahunchane ke liye kaha gaya tha
 According to sources, Congress Parliamentary Party chief Sonia Gandhi was somewhat hesitant about such protest in the House but Rahul gave a green signal to his soldiers with full force for 'issues-based' slogans
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 se pehle modi sarkaar ne savarna aarakshan kaa bada daanv chalaa he, jisase vipaksh pasopesh main he
 From a political point of view, the reservation announced for the poor upper castes is being considered as an attempt by the BJP to overcome the anger of this class
 modi sarkaar 10 pratishat savarna aarakshan dene ke liye mangalvaar ko loksabhaa main samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak pesh karegi
 Once again the political board has been set up regarding reservation
 samvidhan main aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan kii baat nahin kahi gai he
 And to give reservation on economic grounds, it will be necessary to amend the constitution
 is prastaav par dalon ke rukh se bhaajapa chunaav maidan main apni ranneeti ko dhar degi
 RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has so far expressed opposition from the opposition on the upper caste reservation stakes of Modi government
 iske alaava baaki dal kahin na kahin savarna aarakshan ke paksh main khadey najar aa rahe hai
 In fact, political parties like Congress, SP, BSP, LJP have been advocating reservation to the poor upper caste
 aise main ye partiyaan khulkar virodh nahin karengi, lekin loksabhaa main ise laane kii timming or prakriya par sawaal khadey kar modi sarkaar ko gher sakati hai
 Demand for sending the Standing Committee, the government will introduce the Savarna Reservation Bill in the Lok Sabha
 loksabhaa chunaav ke maddenjar koi bhi raajnneetik party iskaa virodh karke savarnon kii naaraazgi mol lenaa nahin chaahegi
 In such a situation, the proposal of sending the Constitution Amendment Bill to the Standing Committee can be recommended by the opposition parties
 haalanki modi sarkaar ise sweekaar nahin karegi
 In the House, the ruling party will talk about discussion in the Lok Sabha, so that everyone's opinion will be expressed on this
 jabaki vipaksh ise sweekaar kare, ye kahana mushkil he
 However, the Modi government will try its best to bring out the opinion of all political parties on upper caste reservation through discussion
 kshetreey dal kar sakate hai viroxvarna aarakshan ko lekar modi sarkaar ko sadan main kshetreey dalon ke virodh kaa saamana karnaa bhi pad saktaa he
 RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has expressed his intentions by opposing it
 itnaa hi nahin endie kii sahyogi party apana dal ne savarna aarakshan aane ke baad obisi ke daayre ko 27 pratishat se or aage badhaane kii baat karne lagi he
 Apart from this, SP and BSP can also raise demand for reservation in terms of population
 iske alaava jatigat janaganana kii report jari karne kii baat saamne aa sakati he
 Some people may knock the door of the Supreme Court for the reservation against the court
 isse pehle bhi narsimha raav sarkaar main jab 10 fisadi savarna aarakshan dene kii sifarish kii gai thi to court ne roak laga di thi
 Apart from this, the recommendation of reservation of minorities, Jats, Marathas and Brahmins in Rajasthan has received a setback from the court
 aise main modi sarkaar ke is daanv ko court se bhi jhatka lag saktaa he
 Actually 49 including the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) and Other Backward Classes (OBC) in the country
 5 fisadi aarakshan he
 The Supreme Court has made it clear in its judgment of Indira Sawhney in 1992 that the total reservation cannot exceed 50 per cent

 Following this statement by Justice Lodha, a new debate has ensued in the world of law

 Amid the ongoing dispute between the Army Chief and the government, the former National Security Advisor Brajesh Mishneghus has blamed both for not taking any action on the allegation of the proposal but he wants General VK Singh to be forcibly sent on leave
 general singh ke 14 karod rupaye ke ghoose dene ke prastaav sambandhi aarope par tippanee karte hue unhone kaha ki meraa najariya he ki mantri or sena pramukh donon koi karrwai nahin karne ke liye jimmedaar hai
 Significantly, General Singh had alleged that he was offered a bribe of Rs 14 crore to approve a contract about which he had informed the Defense Minister
 puche jane par ki kya sena pramukh ko barkhaast yaa unhen jabaran chuttee par bheja janaa chahie, mishra ne ek kaarykram main kaha ki agar unki barkhaastagi hui to kuch or bhi ho saktaa he
 If they are sent on compulsory leave, they are not being dismissed
 mishra ne kaha ki unase kaha janaa chahie ki aap sarkari vetan par do maheene kii chhuttiyaan bitaaiye or phir vetan lijiye or ghar jaaiye
 Regarding the leaking of General Singh's letter to the Prime Minister, Mishra tried to hold the army chief's close aides responsible
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri jinka main bahut sammaan karata hum, aise vyakti nahin hai jo is tarah kaa kuch li karen
 i cannot accept that a bureaucrat in the Prime Minister's Office gave it out
 isliye agar general ne is patr ko khud li nahin kiya he to ho saktaa he ki unke kisi dost ne aisa kiya ho
 On General Singh's recommendation of conducting a CBI inquiry against Three Corps Commander Lt Gen Dalbir Suhag, he said that the army chief is not authorized to do so
 bihar main chhapra jile ke faridpura gaanv ke jogeshwar ke iklaute putr 2 varshiya mandeep ko april ke aakhri hafte main tej bukhaar aane laga
 Mandeep was shown to the local doctor, but instead of recovering, he began to get sharp shocks
 sharir bhi anthne laga
 Jogeshwar admitted his son to a private hospital in Patna in an unconscious state
 dimagi bukhaar kii girakrat main aa chuke mandeep ko ek maheene tak chale ilaaj se koi raahat nahin mili, alabatta mazdooree kar parivaar kaa pet bharne vaale jogeshwar apane rishtedaaron-doston se do lakh rupayon ke karjadaar ho gaye
 When the child's condition worsened, he arranged for an ambulance equipped with a ventilator and on June 20, reached Mandeep's Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College in Gorakhpur
 yahaan use fouran ventilator se las pediatric intensive care unit (piisiu) main bhartee kiya gaya
 The condition of depression is improved by getting specialized treatment
 doctoron ko ummid he ki kuch din main mandeep ko ventilator se hataakar duusare ward main shift kar diya jayega
 The relief for Jogeshwar, who is a pauper, is that his son is being treated for free here
 sirf mandeep hi nahin, gorakhpur medical college main kushinagar kii 5 varshiya dulaari or 8 varshiya ansh samet kul 23 bachche dimagi bukhaar ke khilaaf jang jeetne ke kagaar par hai
 All of them are admitted to PICU on the second floor of the 100-bed ward meant for patients with encephalitis
 inhen bacchon main devaria ke tarkula thanashetra ke rabindra kumaar kii 6 varshiya bacchee khushi bhi he
 He got his treatment here for six months
 ab swasth hokar 25 june ko vah apane ghar laut gai
 In encephalitis or medical terms, encephalitis has become a tragedy for Purvanchal
 gorakhpur, devaria, basti, maharajaganj, kushinagar, sidgharthanagar, santakabir nagar, lakhimpur khiri, baharich or gonda main har saal isse saikadon bacchon kii maut ho jaati he
 But this time things have changed a bit
 varshon se dimagi bukhaar kaa dansh jhel rahe gorakhpur or basti mandal ke saat jilon main is baar beemaari kaa prakope thama he
 The PICU with 71 ventilators for children suffering from encephalitis at the Gorakhpur Medical College was packed with patients in June last year, this time more than half of the beds are empty
 agast 2017 main gorakhpur or uske aasapaas dimagi bukhaar ke marijon main achaanak bahut vruddhi ho gai thi
 The governmental efforts that have started since then are starting to pay off
 pichley varsh ke mukaable is varsh ab tak dimagi bukhaar ke marijon main aadhe se zyada kii kami hui he (dekhen graphics)
 However, the government of former Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath, who took over as the Chief Minister of UP in 2017, faced a tough challenge only after four months
 gorakhpur or aasapaas ke ilaakon main achaanak dimagi bukhaar ke marijon kii baadh-si aa gai
 In Gorakhpur Medical College alone that year 500 children died due to meningitis
 is beemaari se marate marijon or badahaal sarkari intjaam ne duniya bhar main uttar pradesh kii swasthya sevaaon par badnuma daag laga diya
 As a Gorakhpur MP, the real test of a yogi closely watching the outbreak of encephalitis was to show his skills as chief minister by overcoming the disease
 pradesh sarkaar ke swasthya mantri sidgharthanath singh bataate hai, ''dimagi bukhaar kii rokthaam ke sambandh main pehle ke sarkari taur-tareekon ko dekhne par pataa chalaa ki itani khatarnaak beemaari ke ilaaj kii koi guideline hi nahin he
 After this, the Chief Minister immediately constituted a team of experts and asked him to prepare the guidelines
 '' disambar, 2017 main guideline taiyaar hui or iske anuroop dimagi bukhaar se nibatane kaa abhiyaan shuru hua (dekhen box)
 Siddharth Nath Singh says, "work started at three levels
 pehle swasthya sevaaon ko majboot kiya gaya, isamen sabhi sambandhit adhikariyon or karmchaariyon ko prashikshan dekar daksh banaaya gaya or prabhavit kshetron main vrihad jaagrukta kaaryakramon ke jariye logon ko ilaaj kii jaankaree di gai
 The Chief Minister directed the officials to conduct a Patient Audit of encephalitis patients
 iske tahat gramin ilaakon main praathmik swasthya centre (piechasi), saamudayik swasthya centre (siechasi) or jila aspataal se marijon ko sidhe gorakhpur medical college refer karne par doctoron ko iskaa kaaran bataanaa padataa he
 This prevented the tendency of encephalitis patients to be sent directly to Gorakhpur to avoid treatment
 siddharthanath singh ke shabdon main, ''pesheynt audit hone se piechasi or siechasi main bhi dimagi bukhaar ke marijon kaa ilaaj hone laga
 Only very serious patients started being sent to Gorakhpur Medical College
 gramin ilaakon main anseflitis treetment centre or mini pediatric care unit kholane se marijon kii haalat bigadgaye se pehle unhen ilaaj mila
 This game proved to be a changer
 ''model bana medical colejapani anseflitis (jei) kii giraft se kisi had tak nikalne vaale purvanchal par ab acute anseflitis syndrome (eies) kahar barapa rahaa he
 When the AES erupted in August 2017, the health services of Gorakhpur Medical College, the nodal center for the treatment of meningitis in Purvanchal, also died
 iske baad abhiyaan chalaakar college kii suvidhaon ko durust kiya gaya
 The number of ventilator-equipped beds in PICU and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit was increased from 58 to 71
 piisiu main tainaat resident doctor naveen kumaar bataate hai, ''dimagi bukhaar ke rogiyon kaa teen staron par ilaaj kiya ja rahaa he
 Serious patients are admitted to PICU
 sudhaar hone par unhen 'haai dencity care unit' (echdiu) main bheja jaataa he
 After considerable improvement, they are monitored keeping them in the normal pediatric ward and discharged when they are fully healthy
 ''janvari se ab tak gorakhpur medical college ke bal rog vibhaag main bhartee dimagi bukhaar peedit 300 se zyada bachche swasth hokar ghar ja chuke hai
 The principal of the college, Dr
 ganesh kumaar bataate hai, ''gorakhpur medical college main dimagi bukhaar ke marijon kaa puraa mukrat ilaaj ho rahaa he
 For this, the government has provided 166 types of medicines
 itnaa hi nahin, college ne marij ke saath ek timaardaar ke bhojan kii vyavastha bhi kii he
 "to protect patients from meningitis from infection, different colored autoclaved sheets are being laid in all the wards, including PICU, seven days a week
 dow
 Ganesh Kumar says, "from the door handles in the ICU of pediatrics to all the stuff there, there is a 'crawler culture' every 15 days so that any infection can be kept away
 '' do varsh pehle medical college main bal rog vibhaag main oxigen kii kami se bhi bacchon kii mautein hui thim
 Special arrangements have been made to ensure that such a situation does not arise again
 agast, 2017 main medical college ke bal rog vibhaag main isiu main supplai ke liye 20,000 kilolitre 'liquid medical oxigen' kaa tanks laga tha
 The supply tube was fitted with a vaporizer to prevent oxygen freezing
 oxigen kii uplabdhta badhaane ke liye 10 kilolitre kaa ek 'rescu tanks' alag se lagaaya gaya he
 Dr
 ganesh kumaar bataate hai, ''bal rog vibhaag ke liye 400 oxigen silinder kaa byaap bhi he
 In case of any problem, oxygen can be given in wards continuously for 15 days without any external supply
 ''or majboot hoga systamkisi bachche ko jatke ke saath tej bukhaar aane par use acute anseflitis syndrome (eies) kaa marij maanakar ilaaj karne kaa nirdesh doctoron ko he
 But what is the cause of this disease, the investigation has not been completed yet
 gorakhpur medical college parisar main 'neshnal institute of vyrology' (enivi), pune kii ek shakha is par shodh kar rahi he

 notebandi ke do saal guuruuvaar ko puure ho gaye
 On November 8, 2016 at eight o'clock in the evening, the Modi government announced the closure of one thousand and 500 notes
 sarkaar ke is kadam ke baad desh ke alag-alag hisson main logon ko kaaphi dikkaton ko saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Long queues were seen outside the ATM
 desh main har shaks kii notebandi se judi apni ek pareshaani kii kahani thi
 When someone was wandering ATM-ATM in search of cash for everyday expenses, someone was spending the night in queues outside the bank
 aisi dilachasp aapbeetee
 a day later, her sister was married to Yasir Ahmed, a resident of Qila Bazar in Rae Bareli, who herself works in a bank, but had to struggle with demonetisation
 wo kehete hai notebandi ke ek din baad bahan kii shaadi thi
 i had come home after taking leave from the bank
 ghar main sari note hajaar or 500 sau kii thi
 In such a situation, when the sudden note ban was announced, the whole family looked at us with great expectations
 aise main papa ne jab kaha ki ab kaise sab kuch hoga, to us vakt mere paas koi jawaab nahin tha
 The first marriage of the house was the armament of the whole family
 aise main ladke ke bade bhai ne papa ko phone karke kaha ki pareshaan mat hona jo ho sake wo karnaa
 Meanwhile, our bank colleagues and many close friends arranged for 100 rupee notes
 tab jaakar sab ho sakaa he
 People kept spreading false news on demonetisation
 
 Ramesh Shukla, a native of Allahabad, is currently residing in Noida
 notebandi ke dauraan ramesh bhopal main rahete the
 After the announcement of Modi's demonetization, there was no problem of cash flow in Bhopal
 ramesh shukla ne bataaya tamaam soshal cites par desh ke alag-alag hisson main notebandi kii pareshaaniyon ke lekar unhen lagata tha ki ye sab bakawaas he log jaanboojh kar aisi kahaniyaan saajha kar rahe hai or likh rahe hai
 But after a fortnight of demonetisation, when Ramesh changed his job and had to shift from Bhopal to Delhi, he got into trouble with demonetisation
 chunki unhone noida ko bhopal jaisaa hi samajha tha cash zyada lekar nahin aae the
 Because of this he had to face troubles
 unhone bataaya, yahaan cash kii bahut dikkat thi, is vajah se jahaan 100 yaa 150 main kaam chal saktaa tha
 Two times had to spend money there
 darasal notebandi ke baad tamaam jagah dukaanon par digital len-dein chalan main bahut nahin tha
 Because of this, they had to book cabs instead of autos
 saamaanya hotalon kii jagah khaane pine ke liye mahange restaurant or dukaanon kaa sahaara lenaa padataa tha
 Obviously, in all this, he had to spend more than his budget
 cash ke liye shahar-shahar bhatkakushinagar ke rahane vaale mahendra kumaar bataate hai ki 23 november ko shaadi thi, jiske liye kharidari shuru hi kii thi ki sarkaar ne notebandi kaa elaan kar diya
 After this, the way there was a problem for the cash and had to deviate from rate to rate, it cannot be told
 sthaneey dukandaaron ke bhugtan or marij haal se lekar cataring tak sabhi cash maang rahe the
 In such a situation, it was felt that the marriage should be postponed for a few days, but the relatives had been invited
 iske chalate shaadi ko usee taarikh main kerani majaburi ban gai thi
 For this, we had to go from city to city to collect money from friends
 notebandi ke chalate shaadi kaa bahut vyavastha nahin ho saki, bas rasm adaayagi hui
 Construction of the house had to be stopped in the middle, Shivdeep Singh, living in Chhapra, Bihar, is currently living in Delhi
 wo bataate hai ki deepawali kaa tyohaar manaane ke liye gaanv gaye the, kuch hi cash le gaye the
 Meanwhile, the father started the work of building a house
 achaanak sarkaar ne notebandi kaa elaan kar diya, jiske chalate cash kii bahut zyada dikkat kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 There was no money in atms and the shopkeepers in the city did not have card sweep machines
 aise main ghar banavane ke kaam ko bich main hi rukvaana padaa tha
 Somehow arranged the money to return to Delhi
 jise phone karo vahi dukh bayaan kar rahaa thamerut ke mawana kasbe ke rahane vaale shaihariff fajil kaa koi bank acount nahin he
 During the demonetisation, he had about 5 lakh rupees and 500 rupees in the house
 wo bataaten he ki rishtedaaron or doston ke jariye kisi tarah se unke acount main paison ko jamaa karavaaya
 However, later on to get those money back, many problems had to be raised
 paise rahete hue bhi lag rahaa tha ki bin paise ke hai
 Whichever friend he called would express his grief and in this case, three months have been spent in a lot of trouble

 "when the Prime Minister Narendra Modi shouted for an answer when the time came, at the bjp's November 22 parliamentary party meeting, the party mps could not afford to raise questions
 lekin bijepi or sarkaar ke man main bad rahi ashankaayen jaahir ho gayi
 The Modi government is now waiting for the December term to end, rather than speak for fear of political damage on the issue
 lekin kareeb ek pakhwada bitne ke baad bhi jis tarah desh main niraashaa kaa maahaul he usase party behad chintit he
 According to sources, the informal report called for through the state in-charge has added to the bjp's confusion
 party netritv ko mili report main is baat ko lekar santushti jataai gai he ki log modi sarkaar ke vimudrikaran ke faisle ke saath hai, lekin halaat se nibatane kii lachar taiyaari ko lekar gussa bad rahaa he
 It was only after these reports that BJP national president Amit Shah held consultations with Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on 21 November at Daktara in Parliament House, where Finance Secretary Shaktikanta Das was also present
 isamen gaanvon main cash nahin pahunchane se ho rahi naaraazgi, kisaanon ko ho rahi asuvidha, or shaadi ke liye nikaali jane vaali raashi ko lekar sakht disha-nirdeshon kii vajah se ho rahi pareshaaniyon par khaas taur se charchaa hui
 Since demonetisation, UP in-charge Om Prakash Mathur has met directly with the Prime Minister for two rounds
 samasyaon se ashankit bijepibijepi ke netaa bhi dabi jubaan kaboolne lage hai ki vimudrikaran kaa faisla bhale sahi ho lekin usko amal main laane kii mukammal yojana nahin thi
 Economists convert the high value (rs 2,000) to replace 86 per cent currency
 ) ke note utaarne kii yojana bana lee, jo arthshaastra ke lihaaj se sahi thi lekin vyaavhaarikta main us note ko utaarne se samasya kaa akalan nahin kiya gaya
 Buying and selling from such a big note is not easy, so Rs 500
 ke note pehle utaare jate to shaayad pareshaani is kadar nahin hoti
 Says a BJP leader, "in the coming 3-4 months, daily laborers, small shopkeepers, small traders will be affected more and due to the atmosphere of despair, buying and selling will be badly affected
 " lekin ek anya netaa kii daleel he, ''is kadam kaa prabhaav vaise to ek timahi ke baad dikhegaa, lekin itnaa tay he ki kam se kam do timahi tak nakaaratmak asar hoga or yahi daur hoga jab bijepi upi ke chunavi samar main hogi
 "BJP feels that in the coming time, the Income Tax Department has shown strictness and if the notice is issued, then the difficulties will increase
 unka kahana he ki abhi tak iskar vibhaag dhanadhy varg se hi deal karata tha, lekin pehali baar use nikvan madhyam varg or jandhan khate waalon se bhi deal karnaa padegaa
 Two and a half lakh rupees on behalf of the government
 tak kii seemaa ko bhi ve jaldbaaji vaala faisla maanate hai
 According to him, if a real estate agent or others deposited Rs 2
50 lakh in the account of a poor
 jamaa kara hi die to iskar vibhaag us khatadharak se kaise nipatega
 In the country where there are such people on a large scale who do not even pay electricity-water bills, how will the Income Tax Department recover from them
 unka kahana he ki jabardastee kii sthiti main naaraazgi bad sakati he, aise main sarkaar ko is par shant rahanaa hi uchit hoga
 However, he also fears that the fight against corruption and black money may have infinite potential for corruption in lower-level bureaucracy
 itnaa hi nahin, bijepi ko yah bhi dar sata rahaa he ki nagaland main kuch janajatiyon ko iskar se chhot he, aise main kaala dhan vahaan jamaa ho saktaa he or naga ugravadiyon ko badhaava mil saktaa he

 The capture of a businessman from Bihar at Dimapur Airport and then the disappearance of the note reinforces this apprehension
 bijepi kii ashanka disambar kii shuruyaat main vetanbhogiyon ko rakam nikaalane main hone vaali dikkat ko lekar bhi he, isliye party chaahati he ki cash flo teji se bade
 One leader says that when demonetisation took place in 1978 it was 2 per cent, but today bringing 86 per cent of the currency back into the system is a serious challenge as it takes at least one to three years for the Reserve Bank's current capacity
 Can
 ghar main hi uth rahe sawaalchunki vimudrikaran kaa faisla sidhe pradhanmantri modi ke str se hua he or isamen sheershasth mantriyon ko bhi loop main nahin rakhaa gaya tha, isliye is par sidhe sawaal uthaane kii himmat koi nahin kar paa rahaa
 "the Indian economy cannot be made like America," says a senior bjp-sangh leader
 america main 2008 main ek bank diwalia hua to puri arthvyavastha charmarati dikhi, lekin bharat main aisa hota he to samoochee arthvyavastha par asar nahin padataa kyonki hamaari arthvyavastha kaa aadhaar bachat he
 So how many foreign invaders came from the Mughals, but the health of the people of India was not affected, because our base is savings
 lekin aaj kii paribhaasha main ghar main padi 15,000 kii nakadi bhi kaale dhan kii shrenee main aa gai he
 "they believe that if the economy moves downwards after one year, it will be difficult and the government may have to suffer political losses in the long run
 party ke kuch netaa yah bhi sawaal uthaa rahe hai ki agar bharat i-country yaa cashles tranjaction kii ore baduya chahta he to kya uski vyavastha uske liye sudrudh he? notebandi ke baad ek baithak main yah sawaal uthaa ki nnya internet, broadband kii speed or isse jude infrastracchar i-tranjaction kaa boj uthaane main sakasham hai kyonki abhi mahaj 3 fisadi hi log iskaa istemaal karte hai
 People in the party are also raising questions that due to incomplete preparation of demonetisation, many questions may arise in the disappointment because the government had also raised a finger in the launch of reliance-jio and now after the demonetisation, Modi from Paytm Advertisements are being published along with the photo of him
 bijepi ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''petm main 40 fisadi share chini company ali baba kaa he, aise main laabh kaa 40 fisadi desh se baahar ja rahaa he
 "they believe that the answer will be given when the adversaries air such arguments
 is netaa kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ko puri taiyaari kerani chahie thi or swadeshi company khadi kerani chahie thi
 The official Rupai card was never promoted
 gaur talab he ki notebandi ke pehle din se hi petm ne apana vigyaapan or prachaar tej kar diya tha, jabaki sarkaaraki ore se rupai card ko pramot karne kii koshish notebandi ke 15wein din vigyaapan ke rup main hui
 However, a question is also arising that cybercrime will naturally increase when most of the transactions start going electronic, how strong is the Indian cyber security system? a group of the party is also questioning the sudden acceptance of Anant Bokil of the Earth Revolution after rejecting the presentation given at the time of Lok Sabha elections
 ek varisht mantri kaa kahana he ki nitin gadakari ke nivas par vistrut prajentation hua tha, jisamen vitt maamalon se jude varishthatam netaaon ne bhi ise bhartiya arthvyavastha ke liye bekaar qaraar diya tha
 The Sangh has not yet come forward to pat anyone's decision on the decision of making trouble for the Sangh is also a matter of discussion in the BJP
 lekin notebandi ke maamle se sangh kii kuch paramparaayen tuutati najar aa rahi hai
 The Gurudakshina of the Sangh is secret and almost in cash
 kisne kitna daan diya, isaki jaankaree dusron ko nahin hoti
 The concept behind the Sangh is to create an egalitarian society
 lekin ab check se gurudakshina par is avadharana ko kshati pahonchegi
 "the RSS, run by public support, runs its activities mainly with the donations of businessmen," says a leader of the sangh-bjp
 lekin ab vyapaariyon par maar padi he to nakad main chanda dene vaale kadam waapas khinchenge to duusari taraf sangh ko nakad main chanda dene vaale korporate ab check se dene main darenge kyonki isse dar rahegaa ki koi duusari sarkaar us par sangh samarthak hone kaa thappa lagaakar pareshaan kar sakati he
 "in such a situation, it is also feared that the Sangh's economic dependency may increase towards the BJP in the coming times
 itnaa hi nahin, sangh jo hameshaa kisi tarah kii aadhikarik sadsyta se inkaar karata he, use ab apane prachaarkon ko vyay patrak (vetan) dene main nakad ke bajaae check se bhugtan karnaa padegaa
 In such a situation, membership of the union will be proved
 isliye notebandi par sangh kaa kitna samarthan bijepi ko miltaa he, yah bhi aane vaale vakt main hi spasht ho paaegaa
 How much benefit in UP, Punjab? This Modi government's move may be seen as a step to break the back of opposition parties in the electoral state of UP, Punjab, but a leader associated with the Sangh says, "there is no power in this argument
" Because there are a lot of NRI people in Punjab and through them funds can be taken
 " unka yah bhi daawa he ki ''upi main bispi ummidavaaron ko paisa detii nahin, balki leti he
 "however, BJP leaders are also apprehensive about the news that in future, the Modi government may tighten gold and lockers
 ek varisht netaa ke shabdon main, ''aisa hua to yah apatkaal jaise dinon kii yaad dilaa saktaa he
 "some party leaders argue that in the coming 6 months, if 50 percent of the currency comes back to the market, then people afraid of apprehension will keep half
 isse bazaar ke sudrudh hone kii ashanka philhal kam he
 In such a situation, it is expected to hit the middle class, which are basically considered the core voters of BJP
 bijepi ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''modi philhal ve
 P
 singh vaali raah par dikh rahe hai
 But when the Mandal Commission came in his time, the socio-political equations changed and its most important factor was V
 pi
 Singh had to suffer because people voted the leaders of their castes and V
 pi
 Singh could not return to power
 " unke mutabik, upi-bihar jaise rajyon ke chunaav main log aakhir main jati ke naam par hi vot daalate hai
 If in the coming time Rs 14 lakh crore
 main se 3-4 lakh karod ru
 If he does not return to the bank, then Modi can present it as a moral victory
 uske baad pradhanmantri or bijepi netritv aane vaale samay main notebandi se hui pareshaani ko dur karne kii bharpai ke liye kuch raahat bhare kadam uthaa sakati he
 But at the moment it is so clear that Modi has taken a big risk, which is troubling to him and his opponents as well
 aise main modi safal hue to ve itihaas purush ho jaaenge, varanaa unhen itihaas ke sabase bade jhanjhaavat kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 a five-member committee headed by SP leader Shivpal Yadav has submitted its investigation report on the Saharanpur riots to Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
 is report main sthaneey bijepi saansad raghav lakhanpal par sampradayik bhavanaaen bhadakaane kaa aaropee lagaaya gaya he
 According to the report, the local administration failed to stop the riots at an early stage
 cameti ne dm, ediem or city magistrate ko bhi prashasnic naakaami ke liye jimmedaar bataaya he

 ) mumbai kii sadak par sabji bechate-bachate chagan bhujabal kab maharashtra ke kaddavar netaa ban gaye, ye shaayad kisi ‘saxes story’ se kam nahi he
 The journey from the Shiv Sena branch head to the Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra in Mazgaon, Mumbai, is a must-learn for any political activist trying to become famous in politics
 maharashtra ke do bade netaa shivasena pramukh bal thakare or maratha strongamain sharad pavaar donon ke saath najdiki se kaam karne kaa anubhav maharashtra main shaayad hi kisi ko mila hoga
 Bhujbal never missed showing his strength to these two leaders when needed to make their point heard
 unhone shivasena tab chodi jab party kii dabangai charam par thi or bal thakare ke naam se bade-bade kaanpate the, vaise hi unhone tab ensipi kaa rasta chunaa jab ye mana ja rahaa tha kii agar wo congress main rahete to shaayad maharashtra ke mukhyamantri banane kaa mauka unhen miltaa
 Politics on its own terms: Politics did politics on its own terms
 uske liye jaruri nidarta unamem thi, lekin kai baar ye nidarta netaa ko beparwaah bana detii he or netaa kaa patan shuru hota he
 An example of Chhagan Bhujbal will be given for this
 is vakt wo maharashtra kii raajnneeti ke pehle itane bade netaa honge, jinhen bhrashtachar ke aarope main salankho ke peeche janaa padaa ho
 His close friends say that this attitude has brought him carelessness
 ghotaalon main fansata gaya bhujabal parivarasan 2003–04 main jababhujbal apane kariyar ke charam parathe, upmukhyamantri hote hue wo ensipi ke maharashtra main mukhiya rahe
 He was considered after Sharad Pawar in the party, the Congress as Pawar's Sipahsalar would have survived him and despite Vilasrao Deshmukh he remained the face of the congress-ncp government of Maharashtra
 mahaj ek saal pehle shivasena kii sarkaar giraane kii koshish bhujabal ke netritv main asafal kar di gai thi or sab kuch thik chal rahaa tha
 Telgi scam came in this way
 dekhte-dekhte scam kii chapet main bhujabal parivaar bhi aa gaya
 The nephew Sameer, who has already been arrested by the Enforcement Directorate, was questioned by the government-constituted SIT
 party ne kar liya kinarub baari chagan bhujabal kii thi
 Despite the peak of his career, he had to resign due to fear that the party might not get caught in the heat of the SIT investigation
 esaiti ne unase poochtacha kii lekin maamla sibiai ke paas jane ke baadachagan bhujabal or unke bhattije samirdonon bal-bal batch gaye
 It is said that Bhujbal felt that the party was not standing with him in difficult times, but his leader Sharad Pawar clearly told him that if he is caught in such cases, he has to face it alone, the party should stay away from a limit It takes shuru kii jati kii raajnneetiis maamle se bhujabal ne ek sikh lee
 Bhujbal, who has been doing politics openly till now, started searching for his land by doing politics
 unhen laga raajnneeti main tike rahanaa he, to unka apana samarthakon kaa base hona chahie or wo tabhi ho paaegaa jab wo obaasi kii raajnneeti karenge
 He survived the Telgi scam arrest but after getting marginalized by politics, he found a way to become OBC leader in Maratha party
 kamaal kii baat to ye he ki shivasena main rahete mandal ayog kaa virodh karne vaale bhujabal obisi aarakshan ke sabase bade samarthak ban gaye
 He had chosen this path even before the image of the corrupt became one, when Bal Thackeray chose Manohar Joshi instead of him in the Shiv Sena in 1991, with angry Bhujbal taking out his OBC card
 halaki us vakt sharad pavaar ne unhen turant congress main jagah de di thi lekin is baar khulkar jaati kii raajnneeti karne ke bajaae unke saamne koi rasta nahin bachaa tha
 So he escaped in the Telgi scam, but the direction of his politics changed
 haalanki is scam ne unki chhavi bhi badal di
 He had become the face of corruption in Maharashtra
 bhujabal ke samarthakon ummiido thi ki wo apni chhavi ko badalane ke liye kuch karenge lekin unhone ummiido par pani pher diya
 Regardless of the allegations, Bhujbaldobara was snatched from the Ministry of Home Affairs after returning to power, but in return got the PWD ie Ministry of Public Works
 mantralay main galat tareeke se tabadale or contract dene kii charchaa bhi turant hi shuru hui
 When in the Maharashtra Sadan case, for the first time, the opposition Shiv Sena accused of giving contract to Bhujbal's contractor, Chamankar, then the Aam Aadmi Party and later Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan even talked about the mess, but Bhujbal kept scolding it as a cabinet decision
 
 ensipi ke sutara kehete hai ki telgi maamle se baahar nikal kar bhujabal beparwag ho gaye the
 Bhujbal was engulfed in the Maharashtra Sadan scam, followed by a spate of allegations
 chagan bhujabal par rajya ke anti karpshan beuro ne maharashtra sadan ghotaale main karodon ke herapheri kaa aarope lagaaya he
 In this case, 14 people are accused along with Bhujbal's son Pankaj and nephew Sameer
 nae maharashtra sadan kaa nirmaan 100 karod rupee kii laagat se kiya gaya tha or tab maharashtra main congress-ensipi gathbandhan kii sarkaar thi
 It was alleged that there were errors in awarding construction contracts
 manamaane tareeke se companiyon ko theke die gaye
 Simultaneously, Sameer Bhujbal and Pankaj created about 62 fake companies, opened bank accounts to white out the money received from this scam
 videsh main koyale kii khan or thermal power plant dikhaaya
 Scams on scams, the trapped Chhaganmala did not stop here, apart from this, there is also a charge against Chhagan Bhujbal for scam of about 890 rupees by giving contracts to his close ones in different 9 projects including Mumbai's Carpet University Land Scam, mumbai-nashik Toll Road
 
 inhen sab aaropon ke aadhaar par pravartan nideshaalay ne june 2015 main chagan bhujabal, unke bete pankaj or bhattije samir sahit 17 logon ke khilaaf mani londring act or femaa ke tahat do exiaar darj kii thi or samir bhujabal ke baad ab khud chagan bhujabal kii giraftaar hui
 Attempts to break the trap of fake companies, ED sources say that it has emerged in the investigation that many fake companies of Kolkata bought shares in both the premiums of Sameer and Pankaj Bhujbal's companies and the money is Hex World in Navi Mumbai
 The name was used to build a housing project
 aamtaur par kalaadhan chupaane ke liye aisi farji companiyon kaa jaal banaaya jaataa he, lekin idi kaa daawa he ye jaal todane main wo kamayaab honge

 After the death of Prophet Mohammed, his family and enemies of Islam started becoming stronger
 pehle dushmano ne mohammad kii beti fatima jahara par hamalaa kiya
 Then his son-in-law Hazrat Ali was stabbed and killed by a sword
 iske baad ali ke bade bete hasan kii shahadat hui
 The motive was to end the family
 According to Islamic scholars, the enemies wanted to eliminate the entire family of Prophet Mohammed
 ali or unke bade bete hasan kii shahadat ke baad ab dushmano ne chote bete hossain ko nishaanaa bananaa shuru kar diya
 The plot to annihilate the family of Yajid and Hussainpangber left Mecca and Medina and reached Karbala
 yajid (jo ki khud ko khalipha maanata tha) ne hossain par apane mutabik chalane kaa dabaav banaaya
 Ordered Hussain to consider him his Khalifa
 vah chahta tha ki agar hossain use maanane laga to islam par uskaa bolbalaa ho jayega, jise wo apane mutabik chalaa sakegaa
 However, Hussain refused to believe so
 hossain ne yajid ke har ofer ko thukraa diya
 When Hussain reached Karbala, there was a small Lashkar with him
 is kafile main auraton ke alaava chote bachche bhi the
 According to the Islamic calendar, Hussain reached Karbala on the second date of Muharram
 iske baad 7 muharram ko yajid ne hossain ke lashkar kaa pani band kar diya or un par apni baat maanane kaa har mumkin dabaav banaaya
 Hussain knew that Yajid is very powerful
 uskaa lashkar kahin zyada bada he
 They have weapons, daggers, swords
 jabaki unke apane log behad kam sankhya main hai
 Despite this, Hussein remained on the same din, which is the Islam of his maternal grandfather and Prophet Mohammad
 is bich yajid ke julm badhate gaye
 However, he could not shake the spirits of Hussain and his convoy
 muharram kii 9 taarikh ko imam hossain ne saathiyon se kafila chhodkar apni jaan bachaane kii peshkash kii
 Hussain said that tomorrow we have to face enemies and they are very powerful, so i want to happily leave you here
 magar, unke saathiyon main se koi bhi nahin gaya
 On the 10th of Muharram, Yazid's army attacked Hussain's Lashkar on the 10th of Muharram
 is jang main hossain samet 72 logon ko katl kar diya gaya
 Among them, Hussein's 6-month-old son Ali Asgar, 18-year-old Ali Akbar and his 7-year-old nephew Kasim (hasan's son) were also martyred
 hossain ko qatl karne ke baad unke gharon main aag laga di gai
 All the women and children left were tied in a single rope and taken to Yajid's court
 yajid ne sabhi ko apana kaidi banaakar jail main dalava diya
 Muslims believe that Yazid oppressed the people to run Islam in their own way
 yajid ne khalipha banane ke liye islam ke aakhri paigambar mohammad ke navaase hossain ko katl kar diya
 On the 10th of Muharram, Muslims express grief in different ways, remembering the same sacrifice of Hussain

 Lalu has been convicted in the Deoghar Treasury case of the fodder scam
 sajaa kaa elaan 3 janvari ko hoga
 In fact, the cycle of time turned around so that Lalu has once again reached the dungeon due to the fodder scam
 ranchi main sibiai court ne RJD supremeo ko devgarh tregeri se 90 lakh kii nikasi ke maamle main gunahagaar mana he or sajaa ke elaan ke liye 3 janvari kii taarikh tay kii he
 Tejashwi was present in the court with Lalu till the judgment in the court
 Lalu Yadav was accompanied by his son Tejashwi
 bina koi pratikriya die donon baap bete chupchaap court room main daakhil hue
 Lalu appeared in the issue of remembering the God sitting quietly
 adaalat ne 22 aropiyon main se sabase pehle un 6 logon ke naam liye jinhen bari kiya janaa tha
 Among them, Congress leader and Bihar CM Rahejganath Mishraka was also named
 lalu ko bhi bari hone kii ummid bandhi lekin jald hi unke chehre kaa rang badal gaya
 It became clear that he is in the list which has the names of 16 criminals

 But Lalu was wrong
 court ne unhen doshi tehra diya
 When Lalu came to the CBI court, the spirit was like a politician
 andaaj main jang jeetne kaa aatmavishvaas tha
 It was an attempt to send a message to the supporters that what is happening is just a conspiracy
 lekin faisle se pehle or faisle ke baad main jameen-aasmaan kaa fark hota he
 Aaj Tak was present in the court room during the hearing
 ajtak samvaadadaata dharmaveer sinha ne court room ke ek-ek vaakye ko apni ankhon se dekha
 Lalu, who always proved to be an iron gram for his opponents, looked helpless and uncomfortable today
 courtroom main lalu kii bechaargi un siyasatdanon ke liye sabak he jo satta kii malai khaane main itane mashgool ho jate hai ki janata ke buniyadi mudde tak yaad nahin rah jate
 Lalu Yadav has heard the verdict as soon as Lalu Yadav has assumed the posture of silence
 lalu ab ummid karenge ki kisi tarah sajaa kii miyaad teen saal se kam rahe kyonki teen saal se zyada kii sajaa kaa matlab hoga jamaanat ke raste band ho janaa
 By January 3, Lalu's restlessness will be on the seventh sky and his entire clan will be beating

 The RJD president surrounded by policemen came out of the court

 Lalu is not alone in the crusade, Bihar stands together '
 baharhaal, faisle ke baad court se lalu ko sidhaa ranchi ke birsa munda jail le jaaya gaya

 Criticizing Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi for interacting with farmers only in non-congress ruled states, Union Minister Nirmala Sitharan on Saturday challenged him to visit the states ruled by his party to know the ground reality of the agrarian crisis
 unhone kaha, ‘‘rahul gandhi ko main congress shasit rajyon khaskar karnataka jane kii chunauti detii hum jahaan pichley kuch maheenon main badi sankhya main kisaanon dwaara aatmahatya karne kii ghatnaayen huin
 '' tamilnadu or andhrapradesh ke anantpur main rahul gandhi ke dauron kaa zikr karte hue unhone kaha ki unhen kam se kam maharashtra janaa chahie tha jahaan pichley congress shashan main badi sankhya main kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii
 Nirmala Sitharaman wanted to know what solution she has offered for such deaths
 bhoomi vidheyak par rahul gandhi ke virodh par vaanijya evam udyog rajya mantri ne kaha ki gandhi ke is bayaan se ki vah jameen kaa ek tukdaa bhi sarkaar dwaara adhigrahit nahin hone denge, se aisa jaan padataa he ki vah vikaas ke khilaaf hai
 He said that for whose benefit land is being acquired - for bridges, roads and other infrastructure
 tippaniyan Nirmala Sitamaran disagreed that people with high aspirations are not happy with one year of Narendra Modi's work
 unhone kaha, ‘‘vaaki, mujhe bhaajapa sarkaar ke bare main jo dharna mili he, vah yah he ki visham paristhitiyon ke baad bhi vah arthvyavastha ko behaal karne main juty he jo pichley das saalon main bikhri gai thi
 When asked about the controversial reply of Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh that farmers are committing suicide due to love affair, they said that they were misunderstood
 vah bas rashtriya aparaadh beuro ke aankade kaa ullekh kar rahe the
 He said, "I challenge Rahul Gandhi to go to Congress ruled states especially Karnataka where a large number of farmer suicides have occurred in the last few months
 ’’ Referring to Rahul Gandhi's visits to Anantapur in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, he said that he should have at least gone to Maharashtra where a large number of farmers committed suicide during the previous Congress regime
 nirmala sitaraman ne jaananaa chaha ki unhone aisi mauton kaa kya hal pesh kiya he
 On Rahul Gandhi's opposition to the land bill, the Minister of State for Commerce and Industry said that Gandhi's statement that he would not allow even a piece of land to be acquired by the government showed that he was against development
 unhone kaha ki aakhir kiske laabh ke liye jameen adhigrahit kii ja rahi he- pul, sadaken or anya buniyadi dhaanche ke liye

 The employees of this currency printing press have now refused to work extra hours apart from shifts
 in karmchaariyon ne saaf kaha he ki wo 12-12 ghante tak ab or kaam nahin kar sakate hai
 The printing and production process of currency notes is likely to be affected by this new development
 abhi tak 4
 5 crore notes were printed in a day which reduced to 3
 4 karod rah sakate hai
 The currency printing press in Salboni has 700 employees and about 150 officers
 bhartiya rigerv bank kii ore se sanchalit 'bhartiya rigerv bank note mudran privet limited' main karmchaariyon ke contract main har din 9 ghante kaam karne kii shart he
 But since the announcement of demonetisation, these employees have been working continuously for 12-12 hours
 karency priting press main ab tak 14 karmchaaree biimaar pad chuke hai
 Apart from this, many more employees are also complaining of poor health due to work stress and weather effects
 bhartiya rigerv bank note mudran karmchaaree sangh ke adhyaksh or trinmul congress saansad shishir adhikari ne kaha, 'karmchaaree biimaar pad rahe hai or unhen overtime kaa bhugtan bhi nahin diya ja rahaa he
 We understand the crisis
 isamen koi raajnneeti nahin lekin ye maanviya aadhaar par thik nahin he
 Employees were working for 12 hours, but could not be worked on further
 isliye hamane maang kii he ki karmchaariyon ke contract ke mutabik unase har din 9 ghante hi kaam liya jaae
 Salboni is a Naxalite affected area
 yahankarency priting presske karmchaariyon kaa kahana he ki press parisar main swasthya kii samuchit dekhbhaal ke liye nunatam suvidhaayen bhi uplabdh nahin hai
 The nearest hospital is also in Midnapore, 25 km away
 karmchaariyon kaa kahana he ki assam rifles or kalaikunda air force base se unhen kaaphi saport mil rahi he lekin karency printing se judi jaankaree or training sirf press ke karmchaariyon ko hi di ja sakati he
 It cannot be shared with anyone else

 The railway accident in Amritsar has lost many families

 Who is responsible for this accident is still being debated
 sthaneey prashasan kaa daawa he ki kaarykram kii ijaajat nahin lee gai, to vahiin railway bhi apana pallaa jhaad rahaa he
 But eyewitness statements raise many questions
 ekchashmadidahappy ne ajtak ko bataaya ki trek par 20 din pehle sarkari karmchaaree kaam kar rahe the, us dauraan jab train vahaan se gujri to uski speed kam kii gai
 According to Happy, during that time the train moved slowly and there was no accident
 happy ne driver par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki driver ko apane sarkari karmchaaree najar aa gaye the, lekin ravan dahan ke dauraan maujuud 5 hajaar log use dikhaai nahin die
 Explain that the Railways is giving a clean chit to the driver in this entire matter
 diarem ne ajtak se baatcheet main bataaya ki driver ne speed kam kii thi
 According to him, the train was running at a speed of 91 km per hour, but later it was reduced and the speed reached 68 km per hour, but that train could not stop and it happened
 isliye nahin roki traindiarem ne bataaya ki haadase ke baad train kii speed 10 kimi prati ghante tak aa gai
 After this, the guard told the driver that people are throwing stones and you do not stop

 Baba Ramdev started his talk with this hunk from the high platform in the Numaish Maidan in Etawah
 vaise to baba yahaan pranayam or raashtra nirmaan ke gur sikhaa rahe the, lekin is dahaad se sabit hua ki ramlila maidan main ranchhod bane baba phir maharathi banakar congress ko ukhaadne kii ladaai ladane aae hai
 As soon as he took the stage, Baba asked the people, "do you want a weak Prime Minister or a strong Prime Minister?" The answer came "strong"
 yahaan umade hujum kii is aawaaj ne na sirf yah dikhaaya ki baba ke aahvaan ko sunne waalon kii taadaad kam nahin hui he, balki baba ko bhi dilasa diya ki logon ke dil par unka karishma abhi chukaa nahin he
 26 October 2011: See photos in India: Baba's yatra, which started from Jhansi in India Today, took about a month to reach Etawah, the demolished stronghold of the Samajwadi Party
 lekin june main dilli ke ramlila maidan main hue andolan ke taur-tareeke or maujuuda yatra ke dharre main ugantarkari badlaav najar aayaa he
 At that stage of the Bharat Swabhiman Yatra, Baba supporters had covered the entire country with flags, banners and hoardings
 tivi par lagaataar baba kaa hallaa tha
 Baba's Lashkar Lashkar was very big and the hype was completely high-tech, whereas this time the promotional material of the Yatra appeared in selected places in Etawah
 baba khud ek college ke rest house main tehre or unka safar chartered vimaanon ke bajaae tata safari ke sahare he
 If something is the same, it is their appeal to the public
 ''maine kal raat 12 baje tak duty kii uske baavjood subah paanch baje baba ke pranyam shivi main pahunch gaya tha
 i do yoga regularly and when Baba himself came to the city, i had to reach
 '' itawa main jila panchayat sabhaagaar main dopaher ke vakt baba ke ek kaarykram main duty par tainaat sipaahi ram kumaar singh ne yah baat kahi
 Click to read more news of India Today, in the Yoga camp also showed that many of the women police were doing yoga along with the duty
 shaayad baba ko pehle khud bhi andaja nahin tha ki unki yatra ko aisa samarthan milane vaala he
 That is why earlier in Etawah there was a program for yoga camp only in the morning
 baad main baba ne shaam kaa satr bhi jod diya
 Local activist Hari Shankar Patel associated with Bharat Swabhiman Yatra said, "people are getting the idea of baba with black money
" log unke saath hai
 In Etawah, many hotel owners have provided hotel rooms free or at a very low price to workers from outside in the yatra
 kai logon ne kaaryakartaaon ke bhojan kaa intjaam apni taraf se karaayaa he
 There was also no shortage of donors
 ''maje kii baat he ki yahaan 12 aktubar ko team anna bhi aane vaali thi or is bare main parche bhi chap gaye the, lekin team anna hisar chunaav main kud padi or yahaan kaa daura radd ho gaya
 Many people met in Etawah who are ready to be the activists of both Baba and Anna's movement 
 sutron kii maane to donon pakshon ne ek hi vyakti ke ghar main karyaalay banane kii pahal bhi kii thi
 Both the parties have also received decent support from non-congress parties so far
 ek-sa janaadhar hone ke baavjood donon paksh apana-apana shrey chaahate hai
 Last time, surrounded by the question of transparency in the use of money in organizing the movement, Baba has adopted a very direct strategy this time
 5,000 ru
 The names of all the donors who donated more than Rs were written on the stage in thick letters and in the evening, they gave a parade of donors on the platform on the pretext of blessing them
 shaayad isi khuli ranneeti se aakarshith hokar samaajawaadee party ke netaaon ne itawa main baba se najdiki dikhaane main koi kasar nahin chodi or daan dene main sabase aage rahe
 Some local BJP leaders also appeared close to Baba
 lekin bahujan samaaj party or congress kii taraf se koi yahaan nahin fatka
 On the question of the BSP, Baba said, "no, there is no such thing, people of BSP have also come to our programs in many places
 congress ke alaava sabhi partiyaan hamaara samarthan chaahati hai
 The SP, which had suffered a bad defeat at the hands of the BSP in Mulayam Singh Yadav's bastion Etawah in the last assembly election, can understand how Baba's charisma is understood by the fact that the party's parliamentary party leader Ram Gopal Yadav has given a guest house
 After reaching Baba, he prayed for a long time in a closed room
 isse pehle akhilesh yadav bhi baba se ekant charchaa kar chuke hai
 Asked the reason for coming here, Neeraj Yadav, who came to attend the program, said, "till now used to watch on TV, now when Sakshat has come to the city, who would miss such an opportunity
" '' or mauka ramdev bhi ganvaana nahin chaahate
 That is why this time, melodious and passionate songs are also being heard from their stage
 anna ke andolan main logon ke jhuumane kii ek vajah vahaan kaa laajawab geet or sangeet bhi tha
 a song full of political meaning played from Baba's stage, "we didn't know so Suraj would speak childish language"
 '' or isi geet main bich main ek pankti ai 'samvidhan ko netaa ke ghar polish karte dekha he
 'the special thing is that Baba talks in a yoga camp as if influencing electoral politics is a small part of his broader nation building agenda, but when addressing the press, he does not hesitate to deliver a political message directly
 yatra ke hasil ke sawaal par baba ne kaha, ''hamane janata ko saaf bataa diya he ki jo baba ke muddon ko samarthan de usee ko vot do
 Congress is against movement, so oppose Congress
 '' lekin sawaal yah he ki ramdev ke andolan kaa asar logon ke dil par hi ho rahaa he, yaa chunaav main unki ungali par bhi hoga
 The judgment will have a far reaching effect because # Aadhaar is relevant for a large no
 of subsidies
 It is also relevant to plug loot & waste that has happened
 i hope the judgement is in favour of # Aadhaar: Mukul Rohatgi, as AG he represented the government in Aadhaar case pic

 com / eb7ai0bnaq Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Varanasi after Azamgarh on Saturday, the first day of his two-day UP visit
 apane sansadeey kshetra ke liye piem modi ne vibhinn pariyojnaon kaa locarpan or shilanyas
 PM Modi laid the foundation stone of schemes worth about 1000 crores here
 kaashi ke vikaas par kya bole modipiem modi ne kaha ki varanasi main aaj jo kaam kiye ja rahe hai wo sthaayee vyavastha ke tahat ho rahe hai, jisase banaras smart city main badal jaaegi
 He said that with the work being done, it is also being ensured that they last for at least 15 years
 iske aage piem modi ne kaha ki aise kaam karne main samay or shram adhik lagata he, lekin ek sthaayee vyavastha khadi kii ja rahi he
 The result of which will be visible to Kashivasis in the coming days
 unhone kaha ki yahaan integrated cmand or control centre par teji se kaam chal rahaa he
 The administration of the entire city, control of public facilities is going to be from here
 iske alaava piem ne kaha, 'new india ke liye ek nae banaras kaa nirmaan ho rahaa he, jisaki aatma to puraatan hi hogi lekin kaaya naveenatam hogi
 In which there will be spirituality and also modernity
 jahaan ke kan-kan main samskruti or sanskaar honge lekin vyavasthaaen smart hogi
 He said that earlier there was a government of another party in the state, due to which the development work here was being hampered
 jabase upi main bhaajapa kii sarkaar ai he tab se kaashi ke vikaas kii gati tej ho gai he
 'don't forget the time 4 years ago' PM Modi, while describing the development work done for Varanasi in his government, also said that we should not forget the time even four years ago, when the systems of Varanasi were in crisis

 December 15 is midnight, the last day to run a 500-rupee note that has become a victim of demonetisation
 iske baad is note ko kahin nahin chalaaya ja saktaa
 The central government has made it clear that it can no longer validate this note even for essential works
 lihaaja, agle kuch ghanton main aap apane paas rakhi500 rupee kii notako nahin kharch kar paae hai to ab aapke paas use 31 disambar tak bank main jamaa karaane ke alaava koi vikalp nahin bachaa he
 On Wednesday, Shaktikanta Das, Secretary, Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance, has given information by tweeting that now the government is not going to increase the time of running this note
 shaktikanta das ne kuch media ke jariye di ja rahi jaankaree ki sarkaar is miyaad main ijapha kar sakati he ko sire se nakaar diya he
 Exemptions for use of old Rs
 500 notes will end on 15 Dec midnight
 Sections of media reporting wrongly as if it's tonight
 — Shaktikanta Das (@dasshaktikanta)december 14, 2016iskaa saaf matlab he ki ab 15 disambar kii aadhi raat ke baad se desh main dawaai, bijli bill, pani bill or anya jaruri kaamon ke liye is note kaa istemaal nahin kiya ja sakegaa
 Significantly, the Central Government had already banned the use of this currency for petrol pumps, toll plazas, railways and air tickets
 november 8 ko notebandilagu karne ke baad sarkaar ne pehle puraani 500 or 1000 rupee kii karency ko istemaal karne ke liye 72 ghaten kaa samay diya tha
 But to extend this period continuously, the last date was fixed for 15 December
 bijepi ke alpsankhyak morche ne aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ke us bayaan kaa bachaav kiya he, jisamen unhone desh ke logon ko hindu or hindutv ko bharat kii pahchaan bataaya tha
 The rationale behind defending the statement is that Bhagwat's remarks are in social context and should not be viewed from a religious perspective
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kii team main phir se alpsankhyak morcha ke adhyaksh bane abdul rashid ansaari ne maamle main kaha, 'mere khyal se unka (bhagwat) jo kuch bhi kahana tha wo saamaajik sandarbh main tha
 He did not say this in religious terms that the people of other religions are also Hindus
 is bayaan ko saamaajik nazariye se dekha janaa chahie
 There should be no objection to this
 'ansaari ne aage kaha ki jab ham ikbaal kaa geet padhate hai to garv se kehete hai ki hindi hai ham, vatan he hindustan hamaara
 Somewhere the Hindi word is used for Hindustani, in Iranian literature Sindhu is called Hindu
 us sandarbh main bhi dekhen to hindu shabd kaa istemaal dharmik sandarbh main nahin, saamaajik sandarbh main hota he
 From a social perspective there is no problem in the use of the word Hindu
 gauratlab he ki pichley dinon odisha ke katak main bhavgat ne kaha tha ki jab america ke log america, germany ke log german or england ke log angrej kahe ja sakate hai to hindustan main rahane waalon ko hindu kyon nahin kaha ja saktaa
 a few days later, at the Vishwa Hindu Parishad event in Mumbai too, Bhagwat said that Hindutva is the identity of India and that Hindutva has the potential to absorb other identities
 dangon ke prati rajya sarkaar kii jimmedaarialpsankhyak morcha ke adhyaksh ansaari ne congress ke un aaropon ko khaarij kar diya ki modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal main desh main sampradayik hinsa kii ghatnaayen badi hai
 He said, 'nothing like this has happened
 aisa kuch nahin hua jiske liye party ko jimmedaar kaha jaae
 Wherever incidents have taken place, it is the responsibility of the government there
 'ansaari ne kaha ki upi main sabase zyada ghatnaayen hui hai, vahaan bijepi kii nahin balki samaajawaadee party kii sarkaar he
 Communal tensions have arisen in Maharashtra and some other places, where there are no BJP governments
 kanoon-vyavastha rajya kaa maamla he or in ghatnaon ke liye bijepi ko jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 Taking a dig at the Congress, Ansari said, 'the status of the Congress is no longer worth saying
 aise main wo isi tarah ke aarope laga rahe hai
 Their only task is to blame BJP and Modi for everything
 ' The accused has been arrested after a video of a constable molesting two minor girls in up's Mainpuri
 aaropee consteble ko nilambit bhi kar diya gaya he
 The incident of molestation is of Karhal Gate Police Outpost in Mainpuri Sadar Kotwali area

 In the viral video, it is seen that accused Constable Ishwar Dayal is lying on a cot
 shikaayat karne pahunchi ladakiyon main se ek ko vah ashleel tareeke se choota he
 After the video of the incident went viral, a case was registered against the accused under the Poxo Act and he was arrested
 espi rajesh es
 Said, such behavior will not be tolerated at all
 aaropee ke khilaaf maamla darj kar karrwai kii ja rahi he
 At the same time, the accused Constable Ishwar Dayal denied that the girl was molested
 ishwar ne kaha, 'maine us ladki kaa haath pakadakar un donon ko ghar jane ke liye kaha tha
 'let it be said that after the incident went viral, strict action was ordered from the state government against the accused constable
 jiske baad police ne fouran harakat main aate hue consteble ke khilaaf cese darj kar ravivaar ko use giraftaar kar liya
 Significantly, the Chief Minister of the state Yogi Adityanath had said recently that he had inherited the jungle secret, but the rule of law will soon be established in the state

 The BJP has strongly objected to Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's alleged questioning of tribal women from the stage during a recent rally in Madhya Pradesh on the issue of rape
 madhya pradesh ke bhaajapa netaa prabhaat jha ne is kathith sawaal ko adivaasiyon kaa apmaan qaraar dete hue kaha ki vah bhopal kii adaalat main rahul ke khilaaf do alag-alag mukademe daayar karenge
 Prabhat Jha said in a press conference called in the BJP office, Rahul Gandhi while addressing the Congress rally held in Shahdol district on October 17, asked tribal women whether they were raped in the last 10 years of BJP rule in the state
 is

 iske saath hi, congress upaadhyaksh par anusuchit jati-janajati atyaachaar nivaaran adhinium ke ulanghan kaa aarope lagaate hue adaalat main alag se shikaayat pesh karenge
 Jha said, through his objectionable statement on rape, Rahul deliberately insulted the tribals and tried to incite this community against the BJP

 In this one-day visit, the Congress vice-president is to address the party's 'change of power' rallies in Rahatgarh in Sagar district and Indore, the financial capital of the state

 The Ministry stated that Central Ground Water Authority has been given this right under section 3 of the Environment Act

 vaishali kaa vishun raay college apni mafiyagiri kii vajah se beete kai varshon se sarkaar kii radar par tha
 Earlier toppers of this college were also questioned
 lekin rubi raay or saurabh shreshth ke maamle main pehali baar college sarkaar ke sidhe nishane par he
 a big disclosure has been made about this game of getting topped
 bataaya jaataa he ki college iske liye pariksha ke baad chaatro kii copy hi badal detaa tha
 There is no doubt that the Government of Bihar and the Examination Committee are getting very dirty in the matter
 aise main sawaal yah uthte hai ki aakhir phulpruf suraksha hone ke baavjood college top karwaane ke liye copy badalane kii apni centing main kaise safal rahaa?sarkaar ke radar par rahane ke baavjood college ne kii dhaandhlesarkaar ke sutron ke mutabik, puure vaishali jile kii copy jaanch ke liye camoor bheji gai thi, vahinvishun raay colejki copy ko patna ke sabase surakshit maane jane vaale rajendra nagar jaanch centre par laai gai thi
 Topper of this college was questioned last year
 isliye sarkaar ne is baar is college ke liye khaas intjaam tak kiye the, lekin is baar bhi is college kii kapiyon main send lag gai
 According to sources, only the complete copy of the toppers has been changed, the number on this copy is one but the entire copy is different
 kahaan hua kaapiyon main pherbadalsarkaari tantra is baat se halkaan he ki sarkaar kii radar par hone ke baavjood kaapiyon main pherbadal kahaan or kaise ho gaya
 If sources are to be believed, this reshuffle took place at the examination center or at the examination center in Patna
 bahut hi safai se inkaapiyon ko badal diya gaya
 This time the exam was malpractice free
 pichley saal metric pariksha ke nakal kii tasviren duniyabar main viral hui thi or bihar sarkaar kii jamkar kirakiri hui
 So this time the exam was taken so strictly that 50 percent of the students failed in the inter examination
 hajaaron kii taadaad main chaatro ne pariksha bich main hi chhod di
 The video of the entire examination was recorded, but after all, where were the copies changed and at whose behest did such a big job? It is doubtful that a small person cannot do this work in Patna itself
 aise main kahin na kahin kisi badi machhlee kaa haath jarur he
 According to sources, the work of shuffling of copies would have been done in Patna where only certain people were allowed to go
 aise main sarkaar ko ummid he ki uski jaanch report main is baat kaa khulaasa ho jayega ki aakhir kis shaks ke ishaare partoppers kii mafiyagirisarkaar kii naak ke neeche ho gaya
 The Education Minister admitted that some 'black ships' in the system, Ashok Chaudhary, the education minister of the state, said in a special conversation of 'aaj Tak' that there are some black ships in the system who have played with the whole system
 sarkaar ke str par bhi baari chook hui he
 It has unleashed all claims of a malpractice-free examination
 aise main jald hi wo tamaam chehre saamne aaengen jinaki mileebhagat se ise anjaam diya gaya he

 Earlier, during the Panchayat elections, there was a sharp turnaround in both the parties, during which dozens of Bharatiya Janata Party or Sangh workers were killed during the violence
 yaa unka shav is tarah lataka hua mila tha
 Since then, BJP has been aggressively targeting Mamata Banerjee's government in Bengal
 buudhvaar ko jab pradhanmantri modi ne apni raily main bengal kii siem mamata banerjee ko vikaas main speedbraker bataaya to mamata ne bhi unpar palatwaar kiya
 Mamta Banerjee called PM Modi an expiry babu and described BJP as a riotous party

 But this time the BJP has a target of winning more than 20 seats here, which is why all the big leaders including PM Modi, Amit Shah are focused on Bengal
