 apadet:realme ne aaj tak tech ko die ek statemen main kaha he ki company philhal 35 shaharon ke 3,000 stores main oparational he or ise or bhi badhaayaa ja rahaa he
 According to the statement, 'realme is a young brand and we want to give customers the best experience
 policy ke mutabik ham kam margin par products cell karte hai
 We are saddened to hear such a comment from the distributors, as negotiations with retailers are in the initial stages
 haalanki ham is baat par sahamat hai ki ham zyada margin nahin de sakate, isliye colaborate bhi nahin kar sakate hai
 According to dealers selling IT products, they have entered into deals with some of the top brands - Dell, Lenovo, HP and Acer, under which the sale of products is at the online price
 ol india mobile retaillers association (AIMRA) ke president arvinder khurana ne kaha he, 'ofline cellphone stores un brands ke saath sahyog nahin karenge jo online exclusive launch karnaa jari rakhenge
 These are generally cheaper than offline models and if this is not the case, then people are given discounts on these models'
 aapako bataa den ki AIMRA desh bhar ke 25,000 stores ko ripregent karata he
 According to reports, India's popular offline retailers Sangeeta, Purvika and Big c have decided that they will not sell smartphones from online focused brand Realme
 20 hajaar iti retaillers ko ripregent karne vaale saket kapur joffederation of ol indiai association ke secratary bhi hai
 He says, "there is no scope for online exclusive models in this agreement and if the manufacturer launches it, they must first offer it offline"
 Similarly, Sangeeta Mobile managing director Subhash Chandra has said that he did not want Realme's smartphone
 Has decided to sell
 aisa isliye, kyonki online focusd brands kaaphi kam margin dete hai
 Let me tell you that this offline retail in South is quite popular and it has 600 stores
 online or ofline kii ladaai isliye bhi he ki customers ko aam taur par online kharidari par zyada discount milte hai
 These include offers such as exchange offers, cashback and no cost EMI
 iske saath hi i-commers companiyaan samay samay par smartfones par baari discount detii hai
 That is why customers move online to buy cheaply and this causes a loss to offline retailers

 Today, the Congress party may be crying over the alleged injustice done by the central government and the governor in Karnataka, but the truth is that it is itself misusing power to sack state governments, to prevent the largest party from forming the government
 All efforts have been made and in a way, this practice has also been started by him
 congress ne governor ke offis kaa istemaal karte hue virdohi sarkaron ko barkhaast karne or vipakshi dalon ko sarkaar banane se rokane ke kai kukarm kiye hai
 This evil had begun in the Nehru era itself

 (from inputs language) (inputs bhashaa se) No party has got a majority in Jammu and Kashmir
 bijepi netapipuls democratic party(pidipi) or neshnal conference (ensi) ke saath gathbandhan kar jammu-kashmir main hindu siem kaa sapana puraa karne ke liye prayaas jarur kar rahe hai, lekin ye donon hi partiyaan bijepi kii shart par bahut lacheela rukh apanaati nahin dikh rahi hai
 In such a situation, a question is also arising as to whether Jammu and Kashmir is moving towards President's rule? PDP, which emerged as the largest party by winning 28 seats, has told BJP that CM will belong to its party
 aise main 25 siten jeetne vaali bijepi kii sari ummiden ensi par tiki hai, lekin umr abdulla party main bijepi ko lekar matbhed saamne aa rahe hai
 Party leader Devendra Singh Rana has even announced his support for the PDP
 dekhne vaali baat yah he ki kya devendra party line se alag jaakar pidipi ko samarthan kii baat kah rahe hai, yaa phir umr abdulla bhi unki baat se ittefaq rakhte hai? baharhaal, pidipi ko samarthan par bhi tak ensi kii ore se koi aupchaarik ghoshnaa nahin kii gai he
 On the other hand, experts are also saying that if the deadlock over the post of CM continues only then the Governor will have no other option but President's rule
 abhi tak ke halaat kii baat ko dekhen to koi bhi raajnneetik dal sarkaar banane ko lekar aashwast nahin dikh rahaa he
 BJP may have been reduced to 25 seats in the election with 'mission 44+', but this party is showing the most desire to get power
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ke purv pravaktaa or ab bhaajapa ke mahasachiv ram madhav kashmir main deraa daale hue hai
 Now, the question arises as to which two parties will make mistakes to form the government
 shuruyaat main laga ki neshnal conference or bijepi samjhaute par pahunch chuki he, lekin umr kii party ke kai vidhayak bijepi ke virodh main morcha khole hue hai
 Most of the protest is being held about the Hindu CM
 ab pidipi kii baat karte hai
 Senior PDP leader and MP Muzaffar Hussain Baig held two rounds of talks with BJP general secretary Ram Madhav on Thursday after reaching Srinagar
 pidipi pravaktaa ne spasht kiya ki vah ram madhav se nijee taur par mili the,lekin baat nahin bani to unhone kah diya ki baithak kaa siyaasi matlab na nikaala jaae
 The second question is, will the PDP, NC and Congress join hands to keep BJP out of power? The answers to these questions will be found only if someone takes the initiative to form a government in Jammu and Kashmir, but the current situation is pointing towards President's rule
 kya hai vidhansabha ke sameekaran?* jammu-kashmir vidhansabha main kul siten 87* sarkaar banane ke liye 44 kaa jaadui aankada chahie* pidipi sabase bada dal he, jiske paas 28 siten hai* 25 siten jitkar bijepi duusare number kii party* congress ko is baar 12 or neshnal conference ke paas 15 siten(input-ians) Barcelona beat Arsenal 2–0 in the first leg of the Champions League Final-16 played at the Emirates Stadium in London

 In such a situation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his Keynote address that in the events of the past, people must be seeing what is the impact of India's foreign policy today
 ab koi bharat ko aankh dikhaane kaa saahas nahin kar saktaa
 PM Modi said - fear is good, referring to the might of the army and the stern attitude of the government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that today's India is fearless, fearless and decisive
 bharatiyon kii isi ekajutata ne hi desh ke bheetar or baahar kuch desh virdohi logon main ek dar paidaa kiya he
 The atmosphere that has been created today, i would say that this fear is good
 jab dushman main bharat ke parakram kaa dar ho, to ye dar acha he
 When there is a fear of the valor of the soldiers in the terrorists, then this fear is good
 congress kaa naam liye bina piem modi ne kaha ki jab mamaa ke bolne se bade-bade parivaar baukhala jaaen, to ye dar acha he
 When the fugitives fear that their property may be confiscated, this fear is good
 modi virodh karte-karte kuch log desh virodh par utar aae hambalakot par vayusena kii karrwai par uthne vaale sawaal par pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki is badhate hue bharat ke saamne aaj ek chunauti khadi hui he
 The challenge is to get complacency by making fun of our own people
 jab puri duniya aatank kii ladaai ke khilaaf hamaare saath khadi he, to kuch dalon ke netaa sena ke parakram par sawaal khadey kar rahe hai
 Pakistan is presenting these people's articles as evidence
 ye log modi virodh karte-karte desh kaa virodh karne lage hai
 PM Modi said that today the whole country is saying in one voice that if Rafael were there, the results would have been different
 rafel par swaarthniti karte-karte log raajnneeti karne lage hai

 But we announced the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi on 1 February and launched this scheme on 24 February
 hamaari sarkaar 24X7 kaam karti he
 In the previous government, the minimum support price file remained suppressed for 7 years
 unki sarkaar 10 fisadi kamishan ke liye kaam karti thi
 Our government works on a 100 percent mission
 piem modi ne kagress kii purvavarti sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki puraani sarkaar 'dole' or 'deal' vaali sarkaar thi
 He said that the previous government was a government with 'act', our government is a government with 'action'

 PM Modi said that in 2009 our army demanded 1 lakh bullet proof jackets but till 2014 not a single bullet proof jacket came
 hamane apane kaarykaal main 2
 Bought 30 lakh bullet proof jackets
 'ajtak' kii tag line he 'sabase tej', hamaari sarkaar bhi he 'sabase tejpradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki 'ajtak' achche sawaal poochne ke liye janaa jaataa he lekin aaj main bhi 'ajtak' ke manch ke kuch sawaal poochna chahta hum
 Till date, why people were forced to defecate in the open, why till date the government was not sensitive to the disabled? Why was Ganges water so polluted till date? Till today why there was no National War Memorial for the brave soldiers of our army? Why was there no memorial for the police personnel of the country till date
 aaj tak kii tag line he 'sabase tej' to maine sochaa ki main bhi apni sarkaar ke bare main bataa duun ki ham bhi kitne tej hai
 See PM Modi's entire speech PM Modi said that since 1991, we have seen GDP growth grow at the fastest pace in the last 5 years
 1991 se dekhe to pichley 5 saal kii avadhi main hamane sabase tej mahangaai dar ko ghataya he
 Today, roads are being constructed at the fastest speed in the country
 aaj sabase tej gati se railway kaa vikaas kaary ho rahaa he
 Today we are building houses for the poor at the fastest speed
 aaj desh main sabase tej gati se mobile manufeccharing unit lagane kaa kaary hua he
 So just as 'fastest' is your tag line, similarly 'fastest' is the lifeline of our government
 21veen sadi bharat kii hogiapane pehle kaarykaal ke paanch saal kii baat rakhte hue pradhanmantri modi ne kaha ki 2014 se 2019 or 2019 se shuru hone vaali aage kii ye yatra badalte hue sapanom kii kahani he
 It is the story of reaching the pinnacle of hope from a state of despair, a story leading from resolution to accomplishment
 hamane kitabon main khub padhaa he ki ikkisvin sadi bharat kii hogi
 Through the hard work and hard work of the last five years, we have worked to strengthen the foundation of the country
 isi neenv par nae bharat kii bhavy imaarat kaa nirmaan hoga
 Today i say with full confidence that the twenty-first century will be of India

 Supreme Court Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said on Friday that the decision to appoint four judges in just 48 hours shocked him and he was quite shocked
 justise gogoi patrakaron ke kuch sawaalon kaa jawaab de rahe the
 During this period, many things came to light, which shows that major changes can be seen in the working of the Supreme Court in the coming days
 chif justise ranjan gogoi ne ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha, 'ab supreme court main alag-alag 14 bench maamalon kii sunwaayee karengi
 At present, 5 courts with 3 judges run
 28 jaj hone ke baad 14 khandpeeth hongi jo alag-alag maamle teji se nipataayengi
 'A question was asked that this is the first time in history that 4 judges have been appointed within 48 hours

 ipel-8 kaa final khelaa ja chukaa he or mumbai indiens isaki vijeta ban chuki he
 There is no doubt that Mumbai Indians played like champions
 usne toornament main chennai ko ek nahin, do nahin balki teen-teen baar haraaya
 But do you know that despite all this Mumbai's victory, no
 
 
 na
 
 
 It would be better to call it Chennai defeat, a trick was working behind it which was written on the first playoff day
 ji haa agar is totake ko sahi maane to pehle plaof ke din hi yah tay ho gaya tha ki mumbai hi is toornament kii vijeta team banegi
 Let us tell you what this whole thing is
 ipel 2008 main shuru hua or jab se ipel main pehla, doosraa kwalifire or alimineter kaa system shuru kiya gaya he tab se ab tak alimineter khel kar final main pahunchi team is toornament ko nahin jeet saki he
 This means that the team that wins the first qualifier and reaches the final directly becomes the winner of the tournament
 ise mahaj totake ke rup main nahin dekha ja saktaa he
 The team that won the first qualifier four times out of the last five, also won the final
 2011 main chennai super kings, 2012 or 2014 main kolkata nite rides to 2015 main mumbai indiens
 Only in 2013 did Chennai Super Kings manage to do so
 us saal mumbai indiens vijeta bani jisane duusare kwalifire ko jeet kar final main jagah banaai thi
 It can also be seen as such
 ipel lagbhag dedh maheene tak chalane vaala toornament he
 During this time, the players get tired due to continuous play and the team that wins the first qualifier and makes its place in the final gets a lot of time
 team rifresh ho jaati he or final ke liye puri tarah taiyaar hoti he
 On the other hand, the team that passes the eliminator after losing the qualifier has to play more than one match to reach the final of the tournament, while the players are also more tired than the other team

 He said that in the last five years, the Modi government has not kept the bjp's election promises

 shodhakartaaon ke mutabik, koi nayi cheez kharidne kii khushi tab kam hone lag jaati he jab aap duusare logon ke paas usee vastu ke behatar model dekhte hai
 Research researcher psychology professor Thomas Gilovich said, 'imagine you bought a flat-screen TV
 aap isse kaaphi khush hai or phir aap mere ghar aate hai or vahaan bada tathaa adhik saaf tasviir vaala tivi dekhte hai
 This thing makes you somewhat disappointed and angry
 ’unhone kaha, ‘lekin agar aap caribbia main chhuttiyaan manaane gayi hai or aap pate hai ki maine bhi aisa kiya he or meri chhuttiyaan aapse kuch behatar rahi hai to yah baat aapako kuch chintit kar sakati he
 But you will not worry so much because the holidays will be memorable for you
 caribbia se aapkaa bejod rishta ban jaayegaa jahaan aap chuttee bitaa chuke hai
 ' jaise-jaise ham kitabon se dur hote ja rahe hai, kitabon ko lekar ham zyada prem jataane lage hai
 Of those who say that they like to read books, only ten percent actually read books on a regular basis
 baaki kitabon ke bare main pard lete hai
 The situation is worse in Hindi
 pustak premi hone kaa daawa karne vaale kisi shaks se puuchhie ki usne aakhri kitaab koun si padhi he to vah kuch ladkadhaate hue premchand kaa naam le legaa or kitaab kaa naam poochne par unki kisi kahani kaa zikr kar degaa
 Apparently, it is a group that does not read books, even celebrate Book Day
 maine kai jaagruk dikhne vaale logon, patrakaron, ankaron ko dekha he- ve kuch mashhoor lekhakon ke naam jaanate hai, lekin unke lekhan yaa unki kitabon ke bare main nahin jaanate
 In book fairs, literature festivals do not have real authors, often they are celebrities who have become popular for some other reason and are taking advantage of this popularity to write books
 desh main badhate sahitya samarohon ke centre main aksar aisi hi filmi hastiyaan hoti hai, tivi anker hote hai or netaa-cricketer hote hai
 The writer is marginalized somewhere, whose job is simply to give legitimacy to these ceremonies
 vaise yah sach he ki kitaaben hameshaa bahut zyaada nahin padhi gayi
 This is true for at least a hundred years
 beesvin sadi sahitya kii nahin, cinema kii sadi rahi he
 Minor actors of films were more famous than any writer
 filmi duniya ne jin kitabon ko haath lagaaya, ve mashhoor ho gayi
 Sharatchand's very mediocre variety 'devdas' became a classic after the film was made
 'shesh prashn', 'path ke daavedaar' yaa 'charitraheen' jaise unke kahin behatar upanyaason ko kam log yaad karte hai
 Works like 'tamas' and 'chandrakanta' got real fame when they were made serials
 kitabon kii duniya multah skulon, collejon or vishvavidhyalayon tak simit rahi
 She remained the only medium of education and knowledge for centuries
 isliye kitabon ko kuch atirikt shraddha se dekha gaya
 Those who read books are considered intelligent, those who write books and more scholars
 lekin shiksha-sansthaanon ke daayre ke baahar or acadamiyon gatividhiyon se itar shreshth sahitya kam padhaa jaataa rahaa
 Those books which went on to sell mystery thrills, crime and sex
 yah anayas nahin he ki duniya ke kuch sabase mashhoor lekhak jasusi upanyaason ke lekhak rahe hai
 Of course, many of them have been very good writers, but they do not figure in the list of greatest writers who are less well-read but who give more value
 phir bhi kitabon ke ham par bahut ehsaan hai
 They have watered civilizations for centuries
 hamaare bheetar kii manushyata ko bachaae rakhane main unki bhoomika bahut badi he
 Till our generation, there will be millions, if not millions, of people who will remember to hide and read other books apart from course books
 tab ham pustak diwas nahin manaate the, kitabon ke bare main romani dhang se nahin sochate the
 Secondly, as beautiful as it sounds to think about reading books, reading books is not always as beautiful
 vah bahut dhiraj kii maang karata he
 It has to stress the mind
 manoranjak kitaaben aasaani se pard lee jaati hai, lekin jo kitaaben kuch gaharaai kii maang karti hai, jo hamaare antardvandvon kaa suraag detii hai, jo hamen gyaan detii hai, unhen padhate hue kai baar boriyat bhi hoti he
 Many of the world's greatest novels are not first-class readable novels
 unki pathneeyata kuch sharton kii maang karti he
 Of course, they are less read, but they last for centuries
 phir kitaaben sirf acchhee baaten hi nahin, bahut sari buree baaten bhi sikhaati hai
 Books are a source of knowledge
 vah gyaan har tarah kaa ho saktaa he
 If books can make you a human, then sometimes you can force your humanity to leave
 kitabon ke zarie hamane sampradayikta kaa prachaar bhi dekha he or jhooth kaa bhi
 However, in our time books crises are something else
 gyaan par chape hue shabdon kii, kitabon kii ijaaredaari nae madhyamon ne tod di he
 Perhaps after centuries in educational institutions, the importance of books is decreasing and options for computer or online study are increasing
 beshak, ve kitabon par hi nirbhar hai, lekin dhire-dhire yah dikh rahaa he ki yuva peedi padhane main kam, video dekhne main zyaada dilchaspee leti he
 Books are gradually replacing e-books
 kindal kii badhati lokapriyata is tathy kii ore ishaara kar rahi he
 Of course, books - and literary books too - are still being printed and sold in large numbers
 yah dekh kar hairaani hoti he ki hindi main bhi har rose kaviyon-kathakaron or lekhakon kii nai paudh apni nai kitabon ke saath aa rahi he
 Actually, the roots of books are so deeply ingrained in our entire civilization that even if they are easy to remove, it cannot be imagined
 koi aisa din aayega, jab ham kisi pustakavihin samaaj kaa hissaa honge- yah sochna kam se kam hamaari peedi ke liye mushkil he
 But we will not be able to save books by celebrating Book Day and expressing love for books
 kitaaben tabhi bachengi jab hamaare bheetar padhane kaa abhyaas bachegaa
 The practice of reading will be saved only when we have curiosity about our history and geography
 yaheen se kitaab kii ahmiyat khulti he
 Books make up our intellectual environment
 hamaare bache rahane ke liye yah paryaavaran zaruri he
 Read a book, read well, don't just say that you love books
 isisi ne apane nae niyamon ke tahat ballebaajon ko ranor dene kii suvidha khatm kar di he

 Now the name of Gautam Gambhir has also been added to this list
 unhone kaha he ki isse ballebaazon ko kaaphi nuksaan hoga

 But he got his real identity from & tv's comedy show 'bhabiji Ghar Par Hain'

 The Press Council of India and the News Broadcasters Association (NBA) will decide whether the news is fake or not

 We do not know what was the scale of deciding fake news in the minds of the officers and ministers of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting while deciding the punishment for fake news
 kis paribhaasha ke hisaab se mantralay is faisle par pahunchaa ki phek news chhapane, gadhane yaa failaane vaale manyata praapt patrkaar kii manyata radd ho jaaegi
 If found true in the investigation, the recognition of the first journalist will be suspended for six months
 phir agar vah duusari baar paaya gaya to ek saal ke liye manyata nilambit kar di jaaegi or
 If convicted a third time, his or her recognition will be revoked forever
 press council of india or enbie se ummid kii jaati he ki ve 15 dinon main jaanch puri kar lenge magar in 15 dinon main manyata praapt patrkaar nilambit hi mana jayega
 There was a discussion in the journalist fraternity about the decision whether the government wanted to curb the accredited journalists
 bharat main phek news kaa ambara failaa hua he, magar yah kisi ko samaj nahin aa rahaa tha ki phek news kii mahamari manyata praapt patrakaron ke kaaran faili hui he yaa godi media ke chatukaar ankaron ke zarie fail rahi he
 Did the Ministry of Information Broadcasting not consult any institution before reaching this decision? enbiese kii ani joseph kaa bayaan chapa he express main ki unhen jaankaree tak nahin or na hi unase raay lee gai he
 Then at what level this idea comes in the files within the Ministry and there is no information about who was involved in the decision
 subah se hi patrkaar twitor par sarkaar ke faisle kii aalochana karne lage
 Swati Chaturvedi? Wrote that Dear @pmoindia Many arrogant leaders tried to crush the media
 sab naakaam rahe
 Surprisingly, even after the emerald heads of the dock media are feeling insecure
 vahiin, Malini Parthasarathy? ne twit kiya ki news kii satyata or vishwasaneeyata kii jaanch kii zimmedaari media kii he
 What is printed has accountability, there is also a law of defamation and contempt
 isse zyaada niyantran kaa matlab he ki sensharship thopa ja rahaa he
 Rana Safvi has tweeted that MJ Akbar has been forgotten when he marched on Janpath against Rajiv Gandhi's defamation bill
 hamane rajeev se kaha tha ki press kii azaadi se koi samjhauta nahin hoga
 Hopefully MJ Akbar will remember and they will also march against Smriti Irani's order
 Sagarika Ghose ne twit kiya ki phek news koun tay karata he, aap yaa aapaki part? kya bharat band kal hua tha yaa sara kuch phek news tha? kya berojgaare phek news he? notebandi ke dauraan hui maut phek news he? pariksha main parche li hue, phek news he yaa asli news he? Shekhar Gupta? kaa twit tha ki galati mat kiijie
 This is an attack on the mainstream media
 rajeev gandhi ke manahani vidheyak jaisaa lamhaa he ye
 All media should overcome its contradiction and oppose it
 is aalochana ke baad bhi soochna prasaaran mantri smriti irani apane faisle par adi raheen
 Smriti Irani tweets and defends her decision at 12:17 and 12:19
 pehle twit main likhti hai ki The guidelines issued for PIB accreditation states that the Press Council of India and the News Broadcasters Association will define the definition of fake news and take action
 ise lekar bahes ho rahi he
 Many journalists and organizations have contacted us about this and have given positive suggestions
 pehle twit main likhti hai ki kuch patrakaron or sanghathanon ne unase sampark kiya he
 Public information is not known about which journalist and organization contacted them and how the ministry came to the conclusion that only accredited journalists are guilty for fake news, so they should first act and decide what will be the punishment, But someone else will decide the crime
 vaise bhi jab mantri ji apane faisle kaa bachaav kar rahi thi
 a few minutes after that, at 1: 27 minutes, a second decision comes on the Press Information Bureau site that the press release related to Fake News has been withdrawn, which was uploaded the previous evening
 uske baad soochna va prasaaran mantralay ke twitor handle par 2 bajkar 33 minute par yah faisla twit hota he ki phek news ko niyantrit karne ke liye jo dishanirdesh jari kii gai thi, wo press release waapas lee jaati he
 We have checked the Twitter handle of Minister Smriti Irani, whether she has any tweet regarding withdrawal of press release after 12:19 minutes
 unke handle par is sambandh main koi twit nahin mila
 He has retweeted Amit Shah's tweet but has not retweeted his own ministry's decision
 hamane 7 bajkar 21 minute par check kiya ki smriti irani ne faisla waapas lene ke liye pradhanmantri ko dhanyavad tak nahin diya, jabaki enbie ne pradhanmantri ke faisle kaa swaagat bhi kar diya, jiske bare main bhi yah jaankaree nahin he ki enbie ne faisle kii ninda kii thi yaa nahin
 Journalists were about to gather at the Press Club of India at 4:30 pm
 isse pehle bataaya gaya ki pradhanmantri kii pahal par faisla waapas le liya gaya he
 Even after this, a large number of journalists gathered and expressed their concern about the continuous messing up with the freedom of the press
 abhi kuch hi din pehle jeenyu chaatr sangh or shikshak sangh kii raily ke dauraan cameraman ke saath jo hinsa hui thi uske virodh main yahaan patrkaar jamaa hue the or sansad tak march bhi kiya tha
 Nobody knew that it would have to be gathered again in protest against any decision of the government so soon

 See MP Pratap Simha's tweet
 inhone pichley hafte twit kar mahesh hegade kaa bachaav kiya, jo postcard news ke sampadak hai
 Who has been arrested for printing false news about the death of a Jain saint
 jabaki unki maut sadak durghatana main hui thi
 The person who has been arrested on charges of fake news should be defended by the MP and that MP should be nominated in the Press Council of India, where the Prime Minister wants to debate the fake news
 is chakra or kuchakr se to vidambnaa bhi lajaa jaae
 Not only Pratap Simha, there are many other mps who have tweeted in support of the arrest of the editor of Postcard News
 alt news to lagaataar phek news kaa pardaafash karata rahata he, isane postcard news ke kai khatarnaak phek news kaa bhandaphod kiya he

 The Indian Express located this website

 Truecaller revealed that this number was registered in the name of Amit Malviya
 hamane is number par phone kiya magar yah number maujuud nahin tha
 We asked Amit Malviya, the head of the bjp's itcell, whether his number was there, his answer was no
 hamaare sahyogiyon ne saare mantriyon se poochne kaa prayaas kiya, kisi ne jawaab nahin diya
 The comments rajasthan kaa vah kaala kanoon yaad hoga, jiskaa desh bhar ke patrakaron ne virodh kiya tha
 What was that law, that is, you cannot print news against an officer or even take his name unless the permission or FIR is obtained from the government
 agar is niyam ko todaa gaya to patrkaar ko do saal kii sazaa hogi
 There was a lot of opposition to this
 baad main rajasthan sarkaar ko vah adhyadesh waapas lenaa padaa
 Even after this, why the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting took this step, it is beyond the comprehension of whom it was said
 madhyapradesh main ek or aisa kanoon laane kaa prayaas kiya magar is baar wo vidhayakon ke liye tha
 The editor of the magazine Gulab Kothari wrote another editorial titled Kala

 The editor of the magazine Gulab Kothari wrote another editorial titled Kala
 jisaki charchaa dilli tak nahin pahunch saki
 This means that no matter how serious a matter is before a committee, no legislator can ask a question on that issue
 samvedan ghatana or paaramparik daayitv kii aad main sadan main kisi bhi sawaal ko aane se rokane kii koshish thi
 It has been written by Gulab Kothari in his editorial which has appeared in all the editions of Rajasthan Patrika of 21 March
 hamaare saath alt news ke pratik sinha hai jo kai maheenon se akele phek news kaa pardaafash kar rahe hai
 The Press Council of India and the NBA are expected to complete the investigation in 15 days, but in these 15 days the accredited journalist will be considered suspended
 is faisle ko lekar patrkaar birdari main charchaa hone lagi ki kya sarkaar manyata praapt patrakaron par ankush lagaana chaahati he
 In India, the spread of fake news is widespread, but no one understood that the epidemic of fake news is spread due to the accredited journalists or through the spooky anchors of the dock media
 soochna prasaaran mantralay ne is faisle par pahunchane se pehle kya kisi sanstha se vichaar vimarsh nahin kiya
 Annie Joseph's statement from NBSA has been expressed in the Express that she does not even have information nor opinion is taken from her
 phir yah vichaar kis str par mantralay ke bheetar filon main aata he or faisle main koun-koun log shaamil the, isaki koi jaankaree nahin he
 From morning onwards, journalists started criticizing the government's decision on Twitter
 Swati Chaturvedi? ne likhaa ki Dear @pmoindia bahut se ghamandi netaaon ne media ko kuchalane kaa prayaas kiya
 All failed hairaani ho rahi he ki godi media ke panna pramukhon ke baad bhi asurakshit mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Right there, Malini Parthasarathy? Tweeted that the media is responsible for checking the veracity and credibility of the news
 jo chhapata he uski javabdehi hoti he, manahani or avmaananaa kaa kanoon bhi he
 More control means that the force is being imposed
 Rana Safvi ne twit kiya he ki MJ Akbar bhul gaye hai jab unhone rajeev gandhi ke manahani vidheyak ke khilaaf janpath par march kiya tha
 We told Rajiv that there would be no compromise with the freedom of the press
 ummid he emje akbar ko yaad hoga or ve smriti irani ke aadesh ke khilaaf bhi march karenge
 Sagarika Ghose tweeted that who decides fake news, you or your part? Was India closed yesterday or was it all fake news? Is unemployment fake news? Death during demonetisation is fake news? Pamphlet leaked in exam, is fake news or real news? Shekhar Gupta? Had a tweet that don't make a mistake
 mukhyadhara kii media par yah hamalaa he
 It is as long as Rajiv Gandhi's defamation bill
 sabhi media ko apane antarvirodh ko dur kar iskaa virodh karnaa chahie
 Despite this criticism, Information Broadcasting Minister Smriti Irani remained firm on her decision
 12 bajkar 17 minute par or 12 bajkar 19 minute par smriti irani do twit karti hai or apane faisle kaa bachaav karti hai
 Writes in the first tweet that PIB manyata ke liye jo dishanirdesh jari hui he, usamen kaha gaya he ki press council of india or News Broadcasters Association phek news kii paribhaasha tay karenge or karrwai karenge
 There is a debate about this
 kai patrakaron or sanghathanon ne iske bare main hamase sampark kiya or sakaaratmak suzav die hai
 In the first tweet, she writes that some journalists and organizations have contacted her
 saarvajanik jaankaree main nahin he ki kis patrkaar or sanghathan ne unase sampark kiya or mantralay is nattejey par kaise pahunchaa ki phek news ke liye manyata praapt patrkaar hi doshi hai, isliye sabase pehle unheen par karrwai honi chahie or faisla hota he ki sazaa kya hogi, lekin jurm koi or tay kar legaa
 Anyway when the Minister was defending his decision
 uske thik kuch minute baad 1 baj kar 27 minute par press information beuro kii site par ek doosraa faisla aata he ki phek news se sambandhit press release waapas le lee gai he, jise pichhali shaam aplod kiya gaya tha
 Then, at 2: 33 minutes on the Twitter handle of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, a decision is taken that the press release that was issued to control fake news is withdrawn
 hamane mantri smriti irani kaa twitor handle check kiya he, 12 baj kar 19 minute ke baad press release waapas lene ke sambandh main unka koi twit he yaa nahin
 No tweet in this regard was found on his handle
 unhone amit shah ke twit ko ri-twit to kiya he magar apane hi mantralay ke faisle ko ri-twit nahin kiya he
 We checked at 7
21 am that Smriti Irani did not even thank the Prime Minister for withdrawing the decision, while the NBA also welcomed the Prime Minister's decision, which is also not known that the NBA condemned the decision Did it or not
 press club of india main shaam saadhe chaar baje patrkaar jutane vaale the
 It was earlier told that the decision has been withdrawn on the initiative of the Prime Minister
 iske baad bhi badi sankhya main patrkaar jamaa hue or lagaataar press kii azaadi ke saath ho rahe khilwaad ko lekar apni chintaa jataai
 Just a few days ago, during the rally of JNU Students Union and Teachers Union, journalists gathered here to protest against the violence that came with the cameraman and marched till Parliament
 kisi ko pataa nahin tha ki itani jaldi phir se sarkaar ke kisi faisle ke virodh main jamaa hona padegaa

 We called this number but this number was not present
 hamane bijepi ke iticel ke mukhiya amit malviya se poocha ki kahin aapkaa number to nahin tha, unka jawaab tha ki nahin

 Sagarika Ghose ne twit kiya ki phek news koun tay karata he, aap yaa aapaki part? kya bharat band kal hua tha yaa sara kuch phek news tha? kya berojgaare phek news he? notebandi ke dauraan hui maut phek news he? pariksha main parche li hue, phek news he yaa asli news he? Shekhar Gupta? kaa twit tha ki galati mat kiijie
 This is an attack on the mainstream media
 rajeev gandhi ke manahani vidheyak jaisaa lamhaa he ye
 All media should overcome its contradiction and oppose it
 is aalochana ke baad bhi soochna prasaaran mantri smriti irani apane faisle par adi raheen
 Smriti Irani tweets and defends her decision at 12:17 and 12:19
 pehle twit main likhti hai ki The guidelines issued for PIB accreditation states that the Press Council of India and the News Broadcasters Association will define the definition of fake news and take action
 ise lekar bahes ho rahi he
 Many journalists and organizations have contacted us about this and have given positive suggestions
 pehle twit main likhti hai ki kuch patrakaron or sanghathanon ne unase sampark kiya he
 Public information is not known about which journalist and organization contacted them and how the ministry came to the conclusion that only accredited journalists are guilty for fake news, so they should first act and decide what will be the punishment, But someone else will decide the crime
 vaise bhi jab mantri ji apane faisle kaa bachaav kar rahi thi
 a few minutes after that, at 1: 27 minutes, a second decision comes on the Press Information Bureau site that the press release related to Fake News has been withdrawn, which was uploaded the previous evening
 uske baad soochna va prasaaran mantralay ke twitor handle par 2 bajkar 33 minute par yah faisla twit hota he ki phek news ko niyantrit karne ke liye jo dishanirdesh jari kii gai thi, wo press release waapas lee jaati he
 We have checked the Twitter handle of Minister Smriti Irani, whether she has any tweet regarding withdrawal of press release after 12:19 minutes
 unke handle par is sambandh main koi twit nahin mila
 He has retweeted Amit Shah's tweet but has not retweeted his own ministry's decision
 hamane 7 bajkar 21 minute par check kiya ki smriti irani ne faisla waapas lene ke liye pradhanmantri ko dhanyavad tak nahin diya, jabaki enbie ne pradhanmantri ke faisle kaa swaagat bhi kar diya, jiske bare main bhi yah jaankaree nahin he ki enbie ne faisle kii ninda kii thi yaa nahin
 Journalists were about to gather at the Press Club of India at 4:30 pm
 isse pehle bataaya gaya ki pradhanmantri kii pahal par faisla waapas le liya gaya he
 Even after this, a large number of journalists gathered and expressed their concern about the continuous messing up with the freedom of the press
 abhi kuch hi din pehle jeenyu chaatr sangh or shikshak sangh kii raily ke dauraan cameraman ke saath jo hinsa hui thi uske virodh main yahaan patrkaar jamaa hue the or sansad tak march bhi kiya tha
 Nobody knew that it would have to be gathered again in protest against any decision of the government so soon
 hamaare sahyogi amitesh ne vahaan aae patrakaron se baat kii
 Our partners Manas and Nimisha have done a report
 usamen bataaya he ki kahin sarkaar hi phek news kii jad to nahin he
 That too is not a reason for this problem
 khabar ai he ki pradhanmantri chaahate hai ki press council of india main is par baat ho
 But on March 16, some changes have been made in the Press Council of India
 is council ke liye loksabhaa kii spikar kii taraf se mysore se bijepi ke saansad pratap simha manonit kiye gaye hai
 See MP Pratap Simha's tweet
 inhone pichley hafte twit kar mahesh hegade kaa bachaav kiya, jo postcard news ke sampadak hai
 Who has been arrested for printing false news about the death of a Jain saint
 jabaki unki maut sadak durghatana main hui thi
 The person who has been arrested on charges of fake news should be defended by the MP and that MP should be nominated in the Press Council of India, where the Prime Minister wants to debate the fake news
 is chakra or kuchakr se to vidambnaa bhi lajaa jaae
 Not only Pratap Simha, there are many other mps who have tweeted in support of the arrest of the editor of Postcard News
 alt news to lagaataar phek news kaa pardaafash karata rahata he, isane postcard news ke kai khatarnaak phek news kaa bhandaphod kiya he
 Even after this, BJP mps were tweeting in its editor
 twit karne waalon main kendriya mantri ananthakumar hegade bhi shaamil hai
 MP from Delhi Mahesh Giri has also tweeted in support of Mahesh Hegde
 kahani yahi khatm nahin hoti he
 Three days ago, several ministers of the Modi government promote a website claiming to have busted fake news
 uske link ko twit karte hai
 The name of this website is The True Picture, Krishna Kaushik of Indian Express has also done a great reporting about it
 iskaa link to khud smriti irani ne twit kiya he
 When the Indian Express investigated, it found that the correct news has also been told in this website
 khaskar ghoda kharidne par dalit yuvak kii hatya kii khabar express ne sabhi pakshon se baat karne ke baad likhi thi, magar is website par use phek news bataa diya tha
 The Indian Express located this website
 pataa chalaa ki is par ek bluecraft digital foundension kaa phone number he
 It is related to the founding Prime Minister's book Exam Warriors
 express ke kowshik ne jab inase poocha ki aapkaa number is website par kaise he to jawaab diya ki kuch gadabadi hui hogi
 We have no relation
 lekin jab express kii story ke baad hamaare sahyogi maanas or nimisha ne check kiya to vahaan par ab mobile number likhaa mila
 Truecaller revealed that this number was registered in the name of Amit Malviya
 hamane is number par phone kiya magar yah number maujuud nahin tha
 We asked Amit Malviya, the head of the bjp's itcell, whether his number was there, his answer was no
 hamaare sahyogiyon ne saare mantriyon se poochne kaa prayaas kiya, kisi ne jawaab nahin diya
 The comments rajasthan kaa vah kaala kanoon yaad hoga, jiskaa desh bhar ke patrakaron ne virodh kiya tha
 What was that law, that is, you cannot print news against an officer or even take his name unless the permission or FIR is obtained from the government
 agar is niyam ko todaa gaya to patrkaar ko do saal kii sazaa hogi
 There was a lot of opposition to this
 baad main rajasthan sarkaar ko vah adhyadesh waapas lenaa padaa
 Even after this, why the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting took this step, it is beyond the comprehension of whom it was said
 madhyapradesh main ek or aisa kanoon laane kaa prayaas kiya magar is baar wo vidhayakon ke liye tha
 The editor of the magazine Gulab Kothari wrote another editorial titled Kala

 yah foundensh pradhanmantri kii kitaab Exam Warriors se sambandh rahaa he
 When Kaushik of Express asked him how your number is on this website, he replied that there must have been something wrong
 hamaara koi sambandh nahin he
 But when our colleagues Manas and Nimisha checked after the story of Express, mobile number was found written there
 Truecaller, se pataa chalaa ki yah number kisi amit malviya ke naam par darj he
 We called this number but this number was not present
 hamane bijepi ke iticel ke mukhiya amit malviya se poocha ki kahin aapkaa number to nahin tha, unka jawaab tha ki nahin
 Our colleagues tried to ask all the ministers, no one responded
 tippaniyan Rajasthan will remember the black law, which was opposed by journalists across the country
 vah kanoon kya tha, yahi ki kisi adhikari ke khilaaf aap tak khabar nahin chhap sakate yaa uskaa naam nahin le sakate jab tak sarkaar se anumati na mili yaa exiaar na ho
 If this rule is broken then the journalist will be punished for two years
 iskaa khub virodh hua
 Later the Rajasthan government had to withdraw that ordinance
 iske baad bhi soochna va prasaaran mantralay ne yah kadam kyon uthaaya, kiske kehane par uthaaya samaj ke baahar he
 Tried to bring another such law in Madhya Pradesh, but this time it was for the mlas
 patrika ke sampadak gulab kothaari ne ek or kaala naam se sampadakeey likhaa tha
 The discussion of which could not reach Delhi
 iskaa arth yah hua ki kitna bhi gambhir mudda yadi kisi samiti ke saamne vichaaradhin he to koi vidhayak us mudde par prashn hi nahin puch saktaa he
 It was an attempt to prevent any question from coming to the House under the cover of sensing incident and traditional responsibility
 yah gulab kothaari ne apane sampadakeey main likhaa he jo 21 march ke rajasthan patrika ke sabhi sanskarnon main chapa he
 We are accompanied by Prateek Sinha of Alt News who has been exposing Fake News alone for several months
 pehle twit main likhti hai ki kuch patrakaron or sanghathanon ne unase sampark kiya he
 Public information is not known about which journalist and organization contacted them and how the ministry came to the conclusion that only accredited journalists are guilty for fake news, so they should first act and decide what will be the punishment, But someone else will decide the crime
 vaise bhi jab mantri ji apane faisle kaa bachaav kar rahi thi
 a few minutes after that, at 1: 27 minutes, a second decision comes on the Press Information Bureau site that the press release related to Fake News has been withdrawn, which was uploaded the previous evening
 uske baad soochna va prasaaran mantralay ke twitor handle par 2 bajkar 33 minute par yah faisla twit hota he ki phek news ko niyantrit karne ke liye jo dishanirdesh jari kii gai thi, wo press release waapas lee jaati he
 We have checked the Twitter handle of Minister Smriti Irani, whether she has any tweet regarding withdrawal of press release after 12:19 minutes
 unke handle par is sambandh main koi twit nahin mila
 He has retweeted Amit Shah's tweet but has not retweeted his own ministry's decision
 hamane 7 bajkar 21 minute par check kiya ki smriti irani ne faisla waapas lene ke liye pradhanmantri ko dhanyavad tak nahin diya, jabaki enbie ne pradhanmantri ke faisle kaa swaagat bhi kar diya, jiske bare main bhi yah jaankaree nahin he ki enbie ne faisle kii ninda kii thi yaa nahin
 Journalists were about to gather at the Press Club of India at 4:30 pm
 isse pehle bataaya gaya ki pradhanmantri kii pahal par faisla waapas le liya gaya he
 Even after this, a large number of journalists gathered and expressed their concern about the continuous messing up with the freedom of the press
 abhi kuch hi din pehle jeenyu chaatr sangh or shikshak sangh kii raily ke dauraan cameraman ke saath jo hinsa hui thi uske virodh main yahaan patrkaar jamaa hue the or sansad tak march bhi kiya tha
 Nobody knew that it would have to be gathered again in protest against any decision of the government so soon
 hamaare sahyogi amitesh ne vahaan aae patrakaron se baat kii
 Our partners Manas and Nimisha have done a report
 usamen bataaya he ki kahin sarkaar hi phek news kii jad to nahin he
 That too is not a reason for this problem
 khabar ai he ki pradhanmantri chaahate hai ki press council of india main is par baat ho
 But on March 16, some changes have been made in the Press Council of India
 is council ke liye loksabhaa kii spikar kii taraf se mysore se bijepi ke saansad pratap simha manonit kiye gaye hai
 See MP Pratap Simha's tweet
 inhone pichley hafte twit kar mahesh hegade kaa bachaav kiya, jo postcard news ke sampadak hai
 Who has been arrested for printing false news about the death of a Jain saint
 jabaki unki maut sadak durghatana main hui thi
 The person who has been arrested on charges of fake news should be defended by the MP and that MP should be nominated in the Press Council of India, where the Prime Minister wants to debate the fake news
 is chakra or kuchakr se to vidambnaa bhi lajaa jaae
 Not only Pratap Simha, there are many other mps who have tweeted in support of the arrest of the editor of Postcard News
 alt news to lagaataar phek news kaa pardaafash karata rahata he, isane postcard news ke kai khatarnaak phek news kaa bhandaphod kiya he
 Even after this, BJP mps were tweeting in its editor
 twit karne waalon main kendriya mantri ananthakumar hegade bhi shaamil hai
 MP from Delhi Mahesh Giri has also tweeted in support of Mahesh Hegde
 kahani yahi khatm nahin hoti he
 Three days ago, several ministers of the Modi government promote a website claiming to have busted fake news
 uske link ko twit karte hai
 The name of this website is The True Picture, Krishna Kaushik of Indian Express has also done a great reporting about it
 iskaa link to khud smriti irani ne twit kiya he
 When the Indian Express investigated, it found that the correct news has also been told in this website
 khaskar ghoda kharidne par dalit yuvak kii hatya kii khabar express ne sabhi pakshon se baat karne ke baad likhi thi, magar is website par use phek news bataa diya tha
 The Indian Express located this website
 pataa chalaa ki is par ek bluecraft digital foundension kaa phone number he
 It is related to the founding Prime Minister's book Exam Warriors
 express ke kowshik ne jab inase poocha ki aapkaa number is website par kaise he to jawaab diya ki kuch gadabadi hui hogi
 We have no relation
 lekin jab express kii story ke baad hamaare sahyogi maanas or nimisha ne check kiya to vahaan par ab mobile number likhaa mila
 Truecaller revealed that this number was registered in the name of Amit Malviya
 hamane is number par phone kiya magar yah number maujuud nahin tha
 We asked Amit Malviya, the head of the bjp's itcell, whether his number was there, his answer was no
 hamaare sahyogiyon ne saare mantriyon se poochne kaa prayaas kiya, kisi ne jawaab nahin diya
 The comments rajasthan kaa vah kaala kanoon yaad hoga, jiskaa desh bhar ke patrakaron ne virodh kiya tha
 What was that law, that is, you cannot print news against an officer or even take his name unless the permission or FIR is obtained from the government
 agar is niyam ko todaa gaya to patrkaar ko do saal kii sazaa hogi
 There was a lot of opposition to this
 baad main rajasthan sarkaar ko vah adhyadesh waapas lenaa padaa
 Even after this, why the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting took this step, it is beyond the comprehension of whom it was said
 madhyapradesh main ek or aisa kanoon laane kaa prayaas kiya magar is baar wo vidhayakon ke liye tha
 The editor of the magazine Gulab Kothari wrote another editorial titled Kala
 jisaki charchaa dilli tak nahin pahunch saki
 This means that no matter how serious a matter is before a committee, no legislator can ask a question on that issue
 samvedan ghatana or paaramparik daayitv kii aad main sadan main kisi bhi sawaal ko aane se rokane kii koshish thi

 There was a lot of opposition to this

 uttarakhand main chal rahe raajnneetik sankat ko lekarsupreme courtmen buudhvaar ko ek baar phir sunwaayee shuru hui
 The Attorney General (AG), appearing for the Center during the hearing, said that the government is very serious about the issue of floor test and wants some time for resolution
 iske pehle mangalvaar ko sunwaayee ke dauraan justise deepak mishra or justise shiv kirti singh kii bench ne sawaal kiya tha ki uttarakhand main kyon na supreme court kii dekharekh main floor test karaayaa jaae
 For this, the court had asked the Attorney General to take opinion from the Center and postponed the hearing
 AG ne court se maanga shuukravaar tak kaa samaybuudhvaar ko maamle kii sunwaayee shuru hui to agi ne kaha, 'centre sarkaar floor test ko lekar supreme court ke disha-nirdeshon ko kaaphi gambhirtha se le rahi he, haalanki ab tak is sambandh main koidishanirdesh tay nahin hua
 The government should be given time till Friday to take a decision in this regard
 ' court ne agi kii daleelein sunne ke baad centre sarkaar ko floor test par faisla karne ke liye 6 may tak kaa vakt diya he
 The court will decide what will be the procedure in this case on Friday morning 10
 30 baje sunwaayee hogi
 If the government is ready for a majority test then the court will decide its procedure
 haalanki congress kii ore se pesh ho rahe varishtth adhivaktaa kapil sibbal or abhishek manu singhvi ne kaha kii centre apana nirnay le or maamle ko lanbaa naa khinche
 To which the AG said that our intention is not to prolong the case
 
 
 
 So the President's Court will postpone it for some time
 The President's Court said in clear terms that if the Center can make its decision and if the government cannot take a decision, then it will take its own decision on whether to conduct a power test in Uttarakhand
 court ne ye saaf kar diya he ki agar floor test hoga to harish ravat kaa hi hoga or supreme court kii nigaraanee main hoga
 During that time President's rule will be postponed for a while
 centre ke nakaarne par court kaa faisla hoga antingar centre sarkaar kaa jawaab na hota he to supreme court shuukravaar ko hi donon pakshon ko sun kar apni taraf se aadesh degaa
 In view of the stand of the court, it can be speculated that the central government is seen to be surrounded in this matter
 sunwaayee ke pehle din bhi adaalat ne centre se saat sawaal puchhate hue uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan lagane ke masale par shankaa jaahir kii thi
 On April 22, the Supreme Court had stayed the order of the Uttarakhand High Court, in which the decision to go to President's rule was repealed

 Because the court had received many complaints against Singh even during the hearing
 lekin ab chunki sarkaar ne apni report main iskaa khulaasa kar sari chijen record par rakh di hai, lihaaja puraane aadesh kaa koi matlab nahin rah jaataa
 The court cannot under any circumstances give protection to any serious accused

 He said that due to some disturbances in the reading, such bills are generated
 ham unke ghar kii ek baar phir reeding check karenge or uske aadhaar par unhen nayaa bill diya jayega
 Earlier, one such case was also reported from Chhattisgarh

 When the complainant had complained to Chhattisgarh State Power Distribution Company Limited Managing Director k PA Kurian Philip, he had said that it had happened by mistake

 While the BSP got 22 per cent votes despite getting very few seats
 jabaki sapa ko 21
 9 percent and Congress 6
 3 fisadi logon ne vot diya he
 However, BJP has won most of the seats due to the division of votes
 aise main agar bispi, sapa or congress gathbandhan ke saath hoti to kul 50 fisadi vot ek jagah ho sakate the
 In Bihar, the BJP was in a bitter contrast to each other in Harbihar, Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar were together during the elections
 2015 bihar vidhansabha chunaav main argedy-jediu ne congress ke ek saath mahagathbandhan taiyaar kiya tha
 Due to this, BJP had got 24 percent votes, but could not get seats

 koi bhi janm se apradhi nahin hota yaa phir har aadmi janm se apradhi charitra kaa hota he, bas mauka nahin miltaa yaa majaburi nahin hoti
 Along with me, educated people also became engineer-doctors, some also became criminals
