 But on the eve of this rally, Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Yadav has said that Nitish Kumar and Narendra Modi ji's alliance is the culmination of extreme opportunism
 jis narendra modi ke naam par nitish kumaar BJP se alag hue the, unhone 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ko kya-kya nahin kaha? 2015 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaav main narendra modi or bhaajapa ko haraane ke liye unke tepe sunaate the, bahati hawa sa bataate the

 lekin 2017 main nitish kumaar ne janadesh kaa apmaan karte hue saare siddhant, maryaada, niti or niyam taak par rakhte hue jis bhaajapa ko haraaya tha usee se haath mila liya
 According to Tejashwi Yadav, there is still a distrust relationship between Nitish Kumar and Narendra Modi
 nitish kumaar ke kehane se narendra modi ne patna vishvavidhyalay tak ko kendriya vishvavidhyalay tak kaa darja nahin diya to nitish kumaar main itani himmat kahan jo narendra modi se bihar ke liye vishesh rajya kaa darja maang sake? mere pradhanmantri modi or nitish kumaar se kuch sawaal hai
 
 
 The first question is whether Nitish Kumar still considers BJP as 'bharat Burn Party' and 'badka False Party'? If you believe then why is it with you? If you do not agree then apologize for your earlier statement? Does Narendra Modi still consider JDU to be 'suppression and oppression of public'? If we believe, why is the people involved in the oppression and oppression of the people? Third question is whether Narendra Modi will apologize to the people of Bihar for not refusing to give special status to the state? Modi ji had promised and announced several times in the Lok Sabha elections to give special status to Bihar? The question is also whether Modi ji will give a detailed account of the special special package of 1 lakh 65 thousand crore to the people of Bihar? The question is whether Nitish Kumar will sit next to Rambilas Paswan and give a speech on familyism? i challenge Nitish Kumar that if he is against familyism, tejasvi yadav ne poocha ki amrapali ke CMD anil sharma jo nitish kumaar kii party se chunaav lade
 Who contested the Rajya Sabha elections with the help of BJP
 kya mukul roy, yedurappa, sukhram or anil sharma jaise bhrashtachariyon kaa saath lekar narendra modi or nitish kumaar bhrashtachar samaapt karenge? kya narendra modi ji dwaara apni jubaan se ginaayen nitish kumaar ke 33 ghotaale or uske bhi baad hue srijan jaise 10 or bade ghotaalon ke kilaaf karwai kii report janata ko denge? agar modi bhrashtachar ke kilaaf eemaandaar he to nitish kumaar ke kilaaf srijan or duusare ghotaale kii CBI jaanch tej kyon nahin karte? modi hi, yah doharaapan bihar main nahin chalegaa? kya nitish kumaar kal sankalp raily main manch se saarvajanik rup se likhakar yah sankalp lenge or shapath patr denge ki wo 2024 aamchunaav tak bhaajapa ko chhodkar or palati markar kisi duusare gathbandhan se samjhauta nahin karenge
 If they do not do this then it is clear that they can run with any party after the general election
 kya bijepi unase shapath patr legi?tejasvi ne poocha ki ‪kya kal patna main PM modi ji bihar ke CM nitish kumaar kii charchit DNA report saarvajanik karenge? nitish ji ne swayan sahit 1 karod biharvasiyon ke bal or naakun katwakar ek train bharkar PMO bheji thi
 Will Modi ji tell why Nitish ji pulled his plate? Why was his help denied during the flood ? Why did the alliance break with the BJP in his name in 2103? Will Nitish Kumar and Narendra Modi tell why Bihar is not being given special state status? In such a situation, the question also arises whether Narendra Modi would like to give clarification on his promise of giving Rs 15 lakh to every citizen and 2 crore jobs annually to the youth? Will Nitish Kumar apologize to the people for the power-protected and sustainable Muzaffarpur mass rape massacre? dilli main shila dikshit sarkaar or bijli kii badhati daron ke khilaaf ramlila maidan main yojit bhartiya janata party kii raily main pakistan kaa hi mudda chaaya rahaa
 The party's national president Rajnath Singh attacked the central government for not taking any action on Pakistan and said that India should immediately stop any talks with Pakistan after the Pakistan Army's action on the border
 rajnath ne kaha, pakistan ko munh tod jawaab dene kaa samay aa gaya he
 The High Commissioner of India should call back the country to lodge a protest
 pakistan ke saath jo kootnithik rishte hai, use scale down kar dena chahie
 
 
 i said but the pm's ears will not even louse
 samay rahete agar kadam uthaae hote to pakistan kii hamaari chaukiyon par hamalaa karne kii himmat nahin hoti
 The comments aaj kii raily ko darasal dilli main november main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ke liye bijepi ke prachaar abhiyaan ke aagaaj ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 BJP says that through this rally, it will tell 10 such measures, due to which electricity prices in Delhi can be reduced by 30 percent
 haalanki jab rajnath bolne aae, to pakistan ke aage bijli kaa mudda peeche chhutata dikhaai diya
 The BJP challenged Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit and asked them to implement these measures so that cheap electricity can be provided to Delhiites
 saath hi bijepi ne yah bhi kaha he ki agar shila dikshit aisa nahin karatin hai, to iskaa saaf matlab yah he ki mukhyamantri bhi privet companiyon ke saath mili hui hai

 virodh darj karaane ke liye bharat ke hai kamishnar ko waapas desh bula lenaa chahie
 The diplomatic relations with Pakistan should be scaled down
 
 
 maine kaha tha par piem ke kaanon par jun tak nahin rengi
 Had it taken timely steps, it would not have dared to attack our posts in Pakistan
 tippaniyan Today's rally is actually seen as the beginning of bjp's campaign for the assembly elections in Delhi in November
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki is raily ke jariye vah 10 aise upaae bataaegi, jisase dilli main bijli ke daam 30 pratishat tak ghat sakate hai
 However, when Rajnath came to speak, the issue of electricity appeared to be left behind by Pakistan
 bijepi ne dilli kii mukhyamantri shila dikshit ko chunauti dete hue kaha ki vah in upayon ko lagu kare, taaki dillivaasiyon ko sasti bijli muhaiyaa karai ja sake
 At the same time, BJP has also said that if Sheila Dixit does not do this, then it clearly means that the Chief Minister is also involved with private companies

 pravartan nideshaalay (idi)ko jhatka dete hue ek sthaneey adaalat ne mani landring tathaa kar chori ke maamle main vivaadaaspad vyapareehasan ali khanko shuukravaar ko jamaanat de di
 The court has rejected the directorate's plea to question Hasan Ali on remand
 pradhan satr adaalat ke jaj em el tahaliani ne agency kii arji ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki pravartan nideshaalay ne aisa koi saboot nahin pesh kiya he, jiske aadhaar par hasan ali ko remand par diya jaae
 However, the court has laid down some conditions to grant bail to 53-year-old Hasan Ali
 adaalat ne kaha he ki ghodon kaa vyapaaree hasan ali paanch din tak mumbai nahin chhod sakegaa
 Hasan Ali has also been instructed to appear before the Enforcement Directorate officials daily
 pravartan nideshaalay ne kaha he ki vah is faisle ko badi adaalat main chunauti degaa
 Hasan Ali is accused of depositing $ 8 billion in UBS Bank in Switzerland and other illegal transactions abroad
 use somvaar ko pravartan nideshaalay ne mani landring rodhak kanoon ke tahat hiraasat main liya tha
 He is also accused of tax evasion
 idi kii arji ko khaarij kiye jane tathaa hasan ali ko jamaanat par chhodane ke aadesh ke baad jaanch agency ke vakil rajeev avasthi ne kaha ki vah is faisle ke khilaaf badi adaalat main jaaenge
 Awasthi said that after studying the decision, an appeal would be made in a larger court
 avasthi ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘hamaare paas is baat ke joardaar pramaan he, par sambhavat: adaalat ne un tathyon par dhyaan nahin diya
 We will go to the big court now
 ’ unhone kaha ki is maamle main pravartan nideshaalay kii jaanch prabhaavshaalee tareeke se aage bad rahi he
 'we've got some contacts

 adaalat ne kaha tha ki jaanch agency is vyapaaree ko hiraasat main lene ke liye ek maamla bhi pesh nahin kar pai he
 The court had asked the agency to do its 'homework'
 tahaliani ne pravartan nideshaalay kii khinchaai karte hue kaha tha, ‘aap log khan ke khilaaf ek maamla bhi nahin bana paae
 What do you want his remand for? aap usase kya poochtacha karnaa chaahate he
 You have to tell at least one of his crimes
 ’hasan ali ko remand par lene kii apni apil main pravartan nideshaalay ne is baat kaa ullekh kiya tha ki usne videshon main kathith rup se badi raashi jamaa karai hui he
 It also has links with international arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi
 arji main hasan ali ke paas jaali dastavejon ke aadhaar par kai passport hone kaa bhi zikr kiya gaya
 Hasan Ali was arrested in 2008 after a complaint from the Regional Passport Office in this case

 khashogi se hasan ali ke sambandhon par nideshaalay ne kaha he ki isaki gahan chaanbin kii jarurat he, kyonki yah rashtriya suraksha ke liye bhi khatra he
 In view of Hasan Ali's relationship with Khashoggi and people associated with terrorism, the Supreme Court had on Tuesday asked the investigating agencies to explore the option of running a case against the Terrorism Act against him
 hasan ali par jaanch main sahyog na karne kaa aarope lagaate hue pravartan nideshaalay ne kaha he ki vah sabooton ke saath chhedchhad kar saktaa he or videshi bank khaaton main jamaa dhan ko idhar-udhar kar saktaa he
 Just before Easter, a strange dish is going on in China that you will feel disgusted just after listening
 yah dish he, 'ladakon ke peshaab main uble hue andey
 'it is said that this dish has been made and eaten for thousands of years in Dongyang, Zhejiang Province, China
 british website 'daily mail' main chhapi khabar ke mutabik, is saal bhi dongyang ke shef puri duniya ko unki dish aajamaane kaa nyauta de rahe hai
 The chef claims that this time these eggs will be of very good quality and have a 'sour' taste
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki china main in andon kii khaas 'saanskrithik ahmiyat' he
 For thousands of years, there has been a tradition of eating boiled eggs in the urine of children in the spring
 shef lu ming bataate hai ki sthaneey skulon se peshaab ikattha kiya jaataa he
 Boys urinate in buckets and fresh urine is taken from there every day
 shef kaa daawa, healdi hote hai ye andeshef bataate hai ki andon ko do baar peshaab main ubala jaataa he
 First without removing the skin and then later by removing the skin
 iske baad hi unhen khaane ke liye parosa jaataa he
 Ming says, 'these eggs are wonderful and healthy
 unhen khaane se bukhaar nahin aata
 And if you are feeling lethargic then eating them brings freshness
 'vah kehete hai, 'ham ise export karne par bhi dhyaan de rahe hai kyonki ham chaahate hai ki china se baahar ke log bhi hamaari dish kii tarif karen
 'in 2008 the local city declared these eggs as' cultural heritage'
 yahaan tak ki unesco vishwa viraasat ke darje ke liye aavedan karne kii baat bhi charchaa main thi
 However the chefs could not explain why the eggs are some extra sour this year
 shef daawa karte hai ki ye andey sehat ke liye achche hai par dongyang main har koi is theory par yakeen nahin karata
 However, according to the news agency Reuters, Chinese medical experts have warned people about these eggs
 yahaan ke ek nivasee wang jugshing kehete hai, 'hamaare yahaan yah manyata he ki peshaab main uble hue andey sehat ke liye achche hote hai or inase jukham vagairah nahin hota
 But i do not believe it nor do i eat them

 Giriraj on Tuesday indirectly attacked the Bihar Chief Minister after Nitish Kumar's discussion of a secular candidate for the post of Prime Minister was waged

 The BJP quota minister said, "I will continue to support Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi

 Film Name: phantomdirector: Kabir khanstar Cast: Saif Ali Khan, Katrina Kaif, Mohammad Zeeshan Ayub Duration: 147 minscertificates: u / a Rating: 2
 5 starkabir khan ne haal hi main 'bajrangi bhaijan' jaise blockbster film banaai he, or nirmaataa nirdeshak sajid nadiadwala ne 'kik' jaisi behtareen film ko diarect kiya tha
 Now these two have together formed 'phantom' in which Kabir Khan's directorial work is and Sajid Nadiadwala plays the producer
 mumbai ke 26 / 11 aatanki hamale par aadhaarit yah film es
 Hussain is inspired by a book written by Zaidi
 kyaayah filmaashaon par khari utaaregi? aaie samiksha karte he-kahani:film kii kahani 26 / 11 ke bade hamale ke baad banaae gaye ek mishan kii he, jiske tahat is hamale se jude logon ko pakadakar kadi sajaa dena he
 In this mission, Danielal Khan (saif Ali Khan) and Nawaz Mistry (katrina) fall for the important roles
 danial ke is mishan se judane kaa sabase khaas kaaran hota he ki use apane pita ko ye sabit karnaa he ki wo bahut hi kaabil betaa he
 Now can 26 / 11 convicts be arrested? Will they be punished hard? Kabir Khan has tried very hard to show this
 script, abhinay or sangitafilm kii script or screenple saraahneey he lekin interval ke baad film kii kahani ajab-ajab mode lene lagati he or khaas taur se jab film kaa clymex aata he to tipical hindi filmon jaisaa ant dekhne ko miltaa he
 The way Kabir has given visual treatment to the film by shooting in different countries, after that the wish climax would have been a bit better
 kahani ke kuch hisse or ection jabardast hai lekin kuch to he jisaki kami lag rahi thi
 Attempts were also made to emotional in many places, but forcibly being emotional was not enough
 film main kuch aise pal bhi aate hai jab taaliyon kii gadgadaahat bhi sunne ko milti he khaas taur se jabasaf ali khanaatankwaadi ko bataate hai ki aakhirkaar bharat kya chahta he
 While watching the film, there is also the fact that there was too much research work in it and money would have been spent
 abhinay kii agar baat karen to saf ali khan ne kaaphi samay baad behtareen acting kii he or vahiin katrina caff se kabir khan ne umdaa acting karwaai he
 Mohammad Zeeshan Ayub's character in the film is also very admirable, which keeps you tied in every single frame
 film ke casting diarector kii bhi tarif kerani hogi ki unhone driver se lekar ahm kirdaaron kaa chayan sahi kiya he
 The music of the film was also correct according to the chance of the occasion, especially the background song, which often comes in a chunky atmosphere
 kyon dekhen-kabir ne film ko ek tag line di he 'kaash ye kahani sach hoti' or vaaki is kahani ko dekhakar aap yahi kahana chahenge
 If you are a fan of Saif Ali Khan, Katrina Kaif or Kabir Khan then definitely watch the film
 kyon naa dekhen-agar aapako deshbhakti kii bhaavana vaali or thriller filmon se parhez he, to aap is film ko bilkul naa dekhen

 ek bahan ne apane bhai ke ilaaj ke liye jameen aasmaan ek kar diya
 Her brother Santosh had a bad kidney
 doctoron ne kidney transplant kii salaah di
 The younger sister's kidneys matched
 is bich paisa aade aa rahaa tha, jisaki kami pradhanmantri raahat kosh ne puri kar di
 Despite this, her sister could not save her brother
 kyonki pijiai lakhanu main is tarah marijon ke sankhya unki kshamta se zyaada he
 Because of which he was getting a long date
 is date kaa intazaar santosh or uski bahan to kar rahi thi par maut ko intazaar manjuur nahin tha
 She came out very unhappy and took away her brother Santosh from her life forever
 bhai ke jane kaa ye sadma bahan rekha par aisa padaa he ki wo uske gam main kabhi behosh hoti he, to kabhi uth kar uske liye khaanaa banane ki jid karne lagati he
 Then suddenly Lori starts listening to him
 sara ghar ab use sambhaal rahaa he
 She feels that the system has killed her brother more than the disease, so she wants this system to be cured
 santosh kii bahan reeta bataati hai ki aaj niraashaa is baat kii he ki mere ghar kaa chiraag chalaa gaya wo paanch bahanon, do bhaaiyon kaa bhaar lekar chalata tha
 This house had financial support and a lot of desire to live in it and this system killed it
 is system ko badalanaa chahie kyonki jaise aaj ham ro rahe hai vaise koi or na roye
 After this news, when the gathering of the media reaches his house, Rekha drives everyone away with some scolding
 vah kahati he ki aap log chale jaaiye, aap logon ne mere bhaiya ke liye kuch nahin kiya
 Santosh's sister Rita says that i have been running for eight consecutive months
 lakhanu se banaras, banaras se lakhanu, piemo aphis banaras vahaan se pijiai phir vahaan se medical kalege lakhanu
 Medical College Lucknow was running for two months, but SGPGI and PMO office was running for eight months
 vahaan par sirf aashwashan hi mil rahaa tha ki reeta ji yahaan chali jaaie, vahaan chali jaaie, us netaa se mil lijie lekin kuch nahin hua
 In these eight months, Santosh's sisters made every effort to treat their brother
 maa baap kaa saaya pehle hi uth chukaa he
 So Santosh used to teach the children of the neighborhood and run the house
 vahiin, bhai jab biimaar pad gaya to bahanon ne ilaaj ke paise ke liye makaan girvee rakh diya
 When it came to the transplant, the PMO approached the office, there was a hearing and 2 lakh 17 thousand also got help
 jo esagipijiai main jamaa ho gaya
 But there he could not find a date for the transplant
 esagipijiai ne kaha ki date itani jaldi nahin mil paaegi or date leni he to saal dedh saal baad number mil saktaa he or agar problem hoti he to daily dialysis karaao
 But the big question is that one who does not have money can do dialysis everyday because a dialysis costs four to five thousand rupees
 tippaniyan So all the siblings were daring to mortgage the house too
 par jab date nahin mili or kidney intazaar nahin kar saki to santosh hameshaa ke liye apane bhai bahanon se dur chalaa gaya
 Today his siblings are saying that the Prime Minister gave him money but could not get a date
 haalanki santosh or uski bahanon ko to doctoron kii di date kaa intazaar tha par maut bahut besabr thi, usne intazaar nahin kiya
 Santosh's death raises many questions
 kya is desh main garibon ke ilaaj kaa sud lene vaala koi nahin, kya aazaadee ke itane saal baad bhi ham is tarah ki vyavastha nahin kar paae hai ki kidney transplant jaise gambhir ilaaj ke liye har jile main ek mukammal vyavastha ho sake, kya ham is desh main is tarah ki bimariyon ke liye lambii line ko khatm kar sakenge
 The leaders of the country must answer this

 The leaders of the country must answer this
 is khabar ke baad media kaa jamaavada jab uske ghar pahunchataa he to rekha kuch yun daantate hue sabhi ko bhagaati he
 She says go away you guys, you guys did nothing for my brother
 santosh kii bahan reeta kahati he ki main lagaataar aath maheene se daud rahi hum
 Lucknow to Benaras, Banaras to Lucknow, PMO Office to Banaras from there to PGI and from there to Medical College Lucknow
 medical kalege lakhanu to do maheene se daud rahi thi par esagipijiai or piemo aphis to aath maheene se daud rahi thi
 There was only assurance that Rita ji should go here, go there, meet the leader but nothing happened
 in aath maheenon main santosh kii bahanon ne apane bhai ke ilaaj ke liye har koshish kii
 The shadow of the parents has already risen
 lihaaja santosh aas-pados ke bacchon ko padhaakar ghar kaa guzaara chalaata tha
 At the same time, when the brother fell ill, the sisters mortgaged the house for treatment money
 jab transplant kii baat ai to piemo aphis main guhaar lagaayee, vahaan sunwaayee bhi hui or 2 lakh 17 hazaar kii madad bhi mili
 Which got deposited in SGPGI
 lekin vahaan use transplant ke liye taarikh nahin mili
 SGPGI said that the date will not be available so soon and if the date is to be taken, the number can be obtained after one and a half years and if there is a problem then do daily dialysis
 par bada sawaal ye he ki jiske paas dhan nahin wo har roj kaise dialysis kara saktaa he kyonki ek dialysis main chaar se paanch hazaar rupee kharch hote hai
 The comments lihaaja ghar bhi girvee rakh kar sabhi bhai bahan himmat kar rahe the
 But when the date was not found and the kidneys could not wait, Santosh went away from his siblings forever
 aaj uske bhai bahan ye kah rahe hai ki pradhanmantri ne use paisa to dilaa diya par date nahin dilaa paae

 Santosh's sister Rita says that i have been running for eight consecutive months
 lakhanu se banaras, banaras se lakhanu, piemo aphis banaras vahaan se pijiai phir vahaan se medical kalege lakhanu
 Medical College Lucknow was running for two months, but SGPGI and PMO office was running for eight months
 vahaan par sirf aashwashan hi mil rahaa tha ki reeta ji yahaan chali jaaie, vahaan chali jaaie, us netaa se mil lijie lekin kuch nahin hua
 In these eight months, Santosh's sisters made every effort to treat their brother
 maa baap kaa saaya pehle hi uth chukaa he
 So Santosh used to teach the children of the neighborhood and run the house
 vahiin, bhai jab biimaar pad gaya to bahanon ne ilaaj ke paise ke liye makaan girvee rakh diya
 When it came to the transplant, the PMO approached the office, there was a hearing and 2 lakh 17 thousand also got help
 jo esagipijiai main jamaa ho gaya
 But there he could not find a date for the transplant
 esagipijiai ne kaha ki date itani jaldi nahin mil paaegi or date leni he to saal dedh saal baad number mil saktaa he or agar problem hoti he to daily dialysis karaao
 But the big question is that one who does not have money can do dialysis everyday because a dialysis costs four to five thousand rupees
 tippaniyan So all the siblings were daring to mortgage the house too
 par jab date nahin mili or kidney intazaar nahin kar saki to santosh hameshaa ke liye apane bhai bahanon se dur chalaa gaya
 Today his siblings are saying that the Prime Minister gave him money but could not get a date
 haalanki santosh or uski bahanon ko to doctoron kii di date kaa intazaar tha par maut bahut besabr thi, usne intazaar nahin kiya
 Santosh's death raises many questions
 kya is desh main garibon ke ilaaj kaa sud lene vaala koi nahin, kya aazaadee ke itane saal baad bhi ham is tarah ki vyavastha nahin kar paae hai ki kidney transplant jaise gambhir ilaaj ke liye har jile main ek mukammal vyavastha ho sake, kya ham is desh main is tarah ki bimariyon ke liye lambii line ko khatm kar sakenge
 The leaders of the country must answer this
 in aath maheenon main santosh kii bahanon ne apane bhai ke ilaaj ke liye har koshish kii
 The shadow of the parents has already risen
 lihaaja santosh aas-pados ke bacchon ko padhaakar ghar kaa guzaara chalaata tha
 At the same time, when the brother fell ill, the sisters mortgaged the house for treatment money
 jab transplant kii baat ai to piemo aphis main guhaar lagaayee, vahaan sunwaayee bhi hui or 2 lakh 17 hazaar kii madad bhi mili
 Which got deposited in SGPGI
 lekin vahaan use transplant ke liye taarikh nahin mili
 SGPGI said that the date will not be available so soon and if the date is to be taken, the number can be obtained after one and a half years and if there is a problem then do daily dialysis
 par bada sawaal ye he ki jiske paas dhan nahin wo har roj kaise dialysis kara saktaa he kyonki ek dialysis main chaar se paanch hazaar rupee kharch hote hai
 The comments lihaaja ghar bhi girvee rakh kar sabhi bhai bahan himmat kar rahe the
 But when the date was not found and the kidneys could not wait, Santosh went away from his siblings forever
 aaj uske bhai bahan ye kah rahe hai ki pradhanmantri ne use paisa to dilaa diya par date nahin dilaa paae
 Although Santosh and his sisters were waiting for the doctors' date, but death was very desperate, he did not wait
 santosh kii maut kai sawaal khadey kar rahe he

 At the same time, RJD denied being particularly concerned about the party's position
 RJD kii jharkhand ikai ke adhyaksh abhaya singh ne party adhyaksh lalu ke swasthya ko lekar chintaa jataai or unke sheeghra swasth hone kii kaamana vyakt kii
 Abhay Singh said, 'the party has seen many ups and downs since its birth

 We will come back with intimidation
 ’ The Reserve Bank once shocked people
 mudrasphitike aankade aane ke baad usne guuruuvaar kii subahrapo rate main 25 basis panit kii katauteekarke ek bada sanket diya
 After this, repo rate 7 now
 75 pratishat ho gaya
 This simply means that the cut in interest rates has begun
 governor rajan kaa kahana he ki mudrasphiti kii dar main lagaataar aa rahi kami ke kaaran hi yah kadam uthaaya gaya he
 In fact, from last year, we have seen inflation coming down and even more than that, international prices of crude oil have been falling
 ye sabhi byaaj daren kam karne ko prerit kar rahi thim
 It is now certain that crude oil prices will remain at least this year
 monsoon ke lagbhag saamaanya rahane ke kaaran anaajon kii keemten bhi sthir rahane kii ummid kii ja sakati he
 The Reserve Bank also believes that the government has succeeded on the revenue deficit front and will remain in control
 rajan kaa yah bhi kahana he ki agar mudrasphiti kii dar isi tarah kam rahi to agle saal ke shuru main repo rate main kami hogi
 These were the talks of the country's central bank
 lekin sawaal uthta he ki itani zyada byaaj daren apratyaksh rup se mahangaai ke liye jimmdar nahin thim? byaaj daron kii maar se middle class ke log jinhone home lone, car lone liya tha, unke bajet bighad gaye
 The borrowers were unable to repay the loans of the banks
 bainkon kaa enpie badhkar adhiktam par ja pahunchaa
 The situation became such that for the businessmen who were facing the recession, the debt had become a sin of previous birth
 duniya ke kisi bhi vikasshil desh main byaaj daren itani nahin thim jitani bharat main
 This put the brakes in the wheels of the country's economy
 phir bhi rigerv bank apana raag alaapta rahaa
 He felt that this had put a check on inflation, while data showed that inflation did not stop despite interest rates rising 13 times during Subba Rao's tenure
 darasal jab rosemara kii vastuon yaa khaane-pine kii chizon kii mahangaai hoti he to phir byaaj daren badhaane kaa formula kaam nahin karata
 Anyway, in a country like India where black money worth millions of crores is deposited, interest rates do not matter very much
 ek kathor maudrik niti arthvyavastha ko chot hi pahunchaati rahi he
 Now the Reserve Bank has taken a big step
 agar yah aage bhi jari rahaa to udyogon or home lone lene waalon ko raahat milegi tathaa jidipi vikaas dar main teji aegi

 22 navambar 2019 bareli main paanch logon ne kiya naaballigh ladki ke saath gang-rape
 Video made viral 3 november 2019 ko uttar pradesh ke chitrakoot main chah logon ne mahila ke saath kiya gangrape
 The police wrote the woman's complaint when the gang rape video was viral
 23 sitambar 2019 ko bihar ke nalanda se ek video viral hota he tab jaakar prashasan ko pataa chalata he ki ek 13 saal kii ladki ke saath gangrape hua he
 The girl is constantly speaking in the video that she should leave as a sister, but in turn, all the boys present there rape her
 iskaa matlab he ab balaatkaar sirf kshanik sukh ke liye nahin balki paise kamaane ke liye bhi kiya jane laga he
 The demand for gang rape videos is increasing day by day
 apana naam nahin bataate hue bihar ke ek mobile dukandaar ne bataaya ki, porn scrypted or ripited hota he
 Customers download gang rape videos for the purpose
 ”ye to mahaz baangi bhar he
 Do not know how many such incidents which may not have been recorded on the pages of time
 kitni hi aisi peedita hongi jinaki shikaayat police ne darj bhi nahin kiya hoga
 She must be choking even today
 vah jab bhi kisi or ladki ke saath hue gangrape or rape ke viral hue video ke bare main sunati hongi, unki ruh kaanp uthati hogi
 They will once again remember all that has passed over them
 aaj se kuch saal pehle jab ye camere vaale mobile phone nahin hua karte the, tab balaatkaar kii ghatnaon ke aise chatkhaare lete video share hone kii ghatnaayen na ke baraabar saamne aati thim
 It is not that rapes did not happen then
 tab bhi hote the lekin apradhi ke paas na to phone hota tha or na sasta internet, jis par vah pehle aaraam se porn dekhe or phir apni kuntha ko shant karne ke liye balaatkaar karke video banaae
 As technology started to get into our lives and companies provided internet access to everyone, the pattern of social anarchy is coming out
 ab phone or internet donon he lekin bauddhik rup se insaan itnaa sanyamit nahin he ki us technology kaa sahi se apni zindagi ko behatar banane ke kaam main laa sake
 Today, if one of the biggest factors behind the increasing incidents of rape and gangrape is the readily available porn on the Internet
 log bina soche-samajhe watsap or duusare soshal cites par masti main clips share karte hai
 There is a section that is understandable to delete it, but it is not affected, but there is a large part of the crowd that loses consciousness by watching these porn clips
 or use kai samoohon main share karata he
 Then the brain thinks of itself as doing everything that is happening in the video
 phir ye ladke planning shuru karte hai
 They keep an eye on their prey for months and they break up as soon as the girl is seen alone
 lekin sirf balaatkaar karnaa inkaa ab iklauta maqasad nahin hota
 To prove himself as a man among his peers
 ye dikhaanaa kii maine kitni bahaduree kaa kaam kiya he aisa bolkar toxic mentality ko poshit karnaa or duusare ladke ko galat karne ke liye uksaana inkaa maqasad hota he
 Also, now these gang-rape videos are being sold
 30 second ke ek gangrape kii video kii qeemat sau se do sau rupye hoti he
 This business is growing rapidly in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
 kai baar balaatkaar karne kaa uddeshy paisa kamanaa hota he
 There is also a plan to earn money by blackmailing the victim in the mind of those who were raping and to earn money by selling that clip
 wo ye bilkul bhi nahin sochate ki viral hone ke baad us ladki kii zindagi kya hogi
 And it is not at all the case that the administration is not aware of this
 ye local police or rajanetaaon ke naak ke neeche aasaani se ho rahaa hota
 Even yesterday, on a porn site, the name of the doctor Priyanka Reddy, who was victim of gang-rape in Hyderabad, was trending
 ab aap isi baat se andaaza lagaaie ki samaaj kis qadar gart main girtaa ja rahaa he
 We take out lakh candle marches, get the hashtag trending on social media but nothing will happen from that
 jab tak samaaj ke aakiri pankti main khadey logon ko shikshit or sensexies nahin kiya jayega tab tak kuch nahin badalane vaala
 Whenever incidents like Nirbhaya and Priyanka Reddy happen, we protest a little and fall silent
 ham ladakiyon ko taakid dene lagate hai bina samasya kii gaharaai main gaye
 As long as we remain frustrated about sex, we will not discuss it and will not talk to children, especially boys, no change is going to happen
 or ye badlaav ek raat main nahin aane vaala
 We all need to work at our level

 He claimed that the UPA government had done a lot of work unlike the NDA

 Mehram says a person who cannot marry a woman
 masalan, pita, sagaa bhai, putr or pautra evam navasa meharam ho saktaa he
 All India Muslim majlis-e-mushawarat and some other Muslim groups have objected to the exemption of going on Haj without Mehram, saying that the government committee has ignored 'practical problems'
 naihaj nitike sutaradhar maane jane vaale or is visheshgy samiti ke sanyojak afjal amanulla ne kaha, 'nai haj niti taiyaar karne kii puri prakriya ke dauraan hamane saudi arab sarkaar se sampark kiya to pataa chalaa ki mahilaon ke akele haj karne ko lekar unki taraf se koi pabandi nahin he
 Under the agreement between the Government of India and Saudi Arabia, Mehram was arranged to accompany
 hamane 45 saal or isse adhik umr kii mahilaon ke bina meharam ke haj par jane kii ijaajat di
 'he said,' People of different creeds in Muslim society can proceed in their own way on the Mehram case
 agar kisi panth main isaki manaahi he to us sthiti main meharam ko bheja ja saktaa he
 This policy will not be imposed on anyone
 'bhartiya haj samiti ke sadsy mohammad irfan ahamed ne kaha, 'yah krantikari kadam he

 nai haj niti taiyaar karne main vyavhaarik dikkaton ko nazarandaaj kiya gaya he
 The journey of Hajj is difficult
 bahut paidal chalanaa hota he
 There is a lot of fear of getting tired and sick
 in dikkaton ko dekhte hue kisi ke saath hone se aasaani hoti he
 These aspects are not considered in the new Haj policy
 'udhar, afjal amanulla kaa kahana he ki nai haj niti lagu hone ke baad agle saal se haj par kharch kaaphi kam ho jayega
 He said, "after the implementation of the new Hajj policy, living, transportation and other expenses in Saudi Arabia will come down significantly

 Ranchi Municipal Corporation remains a battleground these days
 isamen ek ore khadi hai meyar aashaa lakada, jabaki duusari ore nagar ayukta prashanth kumaar or dipti meyar sanjeev vijayawargeey
 The issue of controversy is the Bright New Company, which maintains street lights in the city
 meyar kaa aarope he ki shahar kii pramukh sadakon par street lite lagane kaa kaam surya company ko diya gaya tha, company ne lite lagaayi bhi, lekin ab street lite ke mentanence ke naam par brit nune company bijli ke khambhon par vigyaapan lagaakar har maah lakhon rupee kama rahi he
 Not only this, the company is not even giving one of its profits to Ranchi Municipal Corporation
 meyar kii maane, to brit nune nagar nigam ko salanaa saat karod rupee kaa chuunaa laga rahi he
 What is the Mammalaranchi Municipal Corporation in the year 2015, took out a tender to remove the leds on all the major roads of the city and replace them with LED lights
 isamen surya company el-van ai thi
 After the contract with the Municipal Corporation, Surya Company installed a total of 9172 street lights on the major roads of the city
 khaas baat yah he ki nagar nigam ke saath hue ikraarnaame main iskaa spasht ullekh he ki shahar kii pramukh sadakon par jitani bhi street lite lagaayi gayi hai, agle paanch varshon tak unka mentanence surya company hi karegi
 But at present, this work is being reduced to bright
 brit nune company ke jimme shahar ke gali-mohallon main lagi sodium vaper lite ke mentanence kaa kaam he
 In such a situation, it is surprising that the maintenance of the light on the major roads of the city
 meyar aashaa lakada ko donon hi muddon par aitraaj he
 He also questioned this, in the brief press conference, he had asked how the Bright New Company got the job of maintenance of street lights of major roads, while Surya Company had to do it? Apart from this, when Bright Min is earning a profit of seven crore rupees annually through advertising, why is Ranchi Municipal Corporation not getting its share? These days the same questions of the Mayor are being considered as the main reason behind the tussle going on in Ranchi Municipal Corporation these days
 company par karodo kii kamai kaa aaropnagar nigam se mili jaankaree ke anusaar rajdhani kii pramukh sadakon par kareeb 1100 bijli ke khambhe hai, jinamein brit nune company dwaara hording lagaaye jate hai
 The company charges 300 to 1500 rupees for putting up an advertisement board
 aise main agar vigyaapan kii ausat dar 800 rupee prati board mana jaye, to 1100 bijli ke khambhon par vigyaapan lagane ke evaj main company ko har maah 8 lakh 80 hajaar rupee kii kamai ho rahi he
 At the same time, the annual revenue of the company through advertisement is Rs one crore five lakh
 haalanki, meyar aashaa lakada kaa aarope he ki company nagar nigam ko salanaa saat karod rupee kaa chuunaa laga rahi he
 The company has ordered an inquiry into the affairs of the company
 Mayor Asha Lakra ordered the city commissioner Prashant Kumar to conduct a high-level inquiry on the mess being done by the mayor company
 is par nagar ayukta ne jo jaanch report meyar ko bheji, usamen unhonebrait nune companiko clin chit dete hue meyar ke aaropon ko tathyaheen bataaya
 Also said that if the mayor has facts to prove the mess of the company, then tell me
 company par karrwai kii jaayegi
 Here, the mayor said that if anything happens, she will stop the game going on in the corporation

 The Delhi High Court has issued a notice to the Ministry of Home Affairs and Law on the PIL seeking to implement the Uniform Civil Code
 centre sarkaar ko is yachika par 8 july ko hone vaali agali sunwaayee se pehle notice par apana jawaab court ko dena hoga
 Interestingly, this petition has been filed on behalf of Ashwani Upadhyay, a BJP leader and a lawyer by profession
 yachika main kaha gaya he desh main aapasi ekajutata, bhaichara or rashtriya akhandta ko badhaava dene ke liye samaan naagarik samhita lagu karnaa jaruri he
 The petitioner says that Articles 14, 15 and 44 of the Constitution have said to implement the Uniform Civil Code of Conduct but the Government has not yet made it
 unhone court se guhaar lagaai he ki wo centre sarkaar ko nirdesh de ki desh ke nagarikon ke liye samaan naagarik samhita banaai jaae jisamen sabhi dharm, jati va sampradaay ke logon ko barabari kaa darja diya jaae or jo samaan rup se sab par lagu ho
 It has also been suggested in the application that the government should implement it on the personal law based on the scriptures and customs of different communities
 yani ki kisi bhi dharm ke reeti rivaaj personal lau ke aadhaar par nahin balki samaan naagarik samhita ke aadhaar par lagu ho
 The petitioner has also demanded the formation of a judicial commission or a high-level committee within three months for its creation
 aswani upaadhyaay ne court main lagaai gai apni janhit yachika main yah bhi suzav diya he ki us cameti kii jimmevary hogi ki wo desh va viksit deshon ke vibhinn dharm, jati, panth va sampradaayon ke behatar dharmik va saamaajik niyam-kanoon ke saath-saath antarrashtriya paramparaon ko dhyaan main rakhkar samaan naagarik aachaar samhita iske baad sarkaar use puure desh main lagu karen
 The petitioner states that Goa is the only state in the country where the Uniform Civil Code has been in force since 1965
 yah niyam vahaan ke sabhi nagarikon par bhi lagu hota he
 This will enforce the spirit of the Constitution
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki samaan samhita lagu karne kaa mudda behad samvedansheel he or isko lekar sarkaar or vipaksh ke bich main pehle se hi talavaarein khinchi hui he
 In such a situation, it will be very important to see what response of the Central Government comes on this application made in the High Court
 uniform civil code kaa zikr bhartiya samvidhan ke bhaag 4 ke anuchhed 44 main hai
 It states that our goal will be to implement the Uniform Civil Code law
 supreme court bhi kai baar ise lagu karne kii disha main kendra sarkaar ke vichaar jaanane kii pahal kar chukaa he
 Apart from this, the Supreme Court has told the Central Government many times that confusion prevails due to different personal laws in the country
 sarkaar chaahe to ek jaisaa kanoon banaakar ise dur kar sakati he
 Most of the personal laws in India are based on religion
 hindu, sikh, jain or buddha hindu vidhi ke antargat aate hai
 At the same time, Muslim and Christianity have their own laws
 muslimon ke kanoon sharia par aadhaarit he
 The laws of other religious communities are based on the constitution of the Indian Parliament

 supreme court ne ek intern dwaara sheersh adaalat ke tatkaaleen peethasin nyaayadhish ke khilaaf lagaae gaye yon utpeedan ke aaropon kii jaanch ke liye teen nyaayadhishon kii samiti gathit kii
 In fact, a young woman intern has accused a recently retired top court judge of abusing her in a hotel room in December last year when the capital was battling a gang rape incident
 is mahila ne isi saal kolkata kii neshnal uniwarsity of juridical science se snaatak kiya he
 She has written in her blog about the alleged sexual harassment incident
 jarnal of indian lau and sosayadi ke liye 6 november ko likhe gaye is blog main mahila vakil ne kaha he ki sheersh adaalat ke nyaayadhish ke saath uske intern karne ke dauraan yah ghatana hui
 According to the blog, last December was important for the movement to protect the interests of women in the country, as almost the entire population of the country automatically came up against violence against women
 yah ajibo-garib vidambnaa hi he ki duniya main ho rahe virodh kii prishthbhumi main meraa aisa anubhav he
 The blog states that i was an intern at the University of Delhi at the time during my winter vacation of my final year
 main apane antim samester ke dauraan atyadhik pratishthit, haal hi main sevanivrutt hue ucchtam nyaayalay ke nyaayadhish ke tahat kaam kar rahi thi
 i worked tirelessly to reach them for their assistance and dodged the police hurdles
 blog main likhaa gaya he, meri kathith karmthata ke puraskaar ke rup main mujhe yon utpeedan (shaareerik nuksaan nahin, lekin hanan karne vaale) se ek vruddh vyakti ne puraskrit kiya, jo mere dada kii umr kaa tha
 i will not mention this painful description, but i will say it so important that i had that experience in my memory long after i got out of the room and i still really do
 kanoon kii is snaatak ne ek website ko intervyuu bhi diya he
 He says that he was harassed by the judge in the hotel room and there is no other witness of the incident
 ‘ligali india’ se baatcheet main is yuva vakil ne kaha, yah hotel kaa cameraa tha, (logon ne) mujhe swechha se jate dekha, mujhe shanti ke saath baahar nikalate bhi dekha
 i did not run away with fear
 us samay mujhe laga ki mujhe shanti ke saath chalanaa chahie
 i did not mention it to anyone that day
 is mahila ne apane blog main haadase main is ghatana kii taarikh kaa zikr nahin kiya, lekin website ko die intervyuu main kaha ki yah pichley saal 24 disambar ko hua tha
 According to the blog, as stated earlier, i have no ill-will towards the person nor do i want to stake his life-long work and reputation
 iske vipareet, mujhe laga ki yah meri jimmedaari he ki duusari yuva ladkiyaan is tarah kii paristhiti main na paden, lekin main iskaa samaadhaan khojane main vifal rahi
 The woman also said that despite the overwhelming public debate, awareness of women's rights and new criminal laws, she does not think this has been curbed
 intervyuu main usne kaha, maine isi nyaayadhish dwaara teen anya maamalon (yon utpeedan) ke bare main suna he or main kam se kam chaar anya ladakiyon ko jaanati hum, jinhone duusare nyaayadhishon ke yon utpeedan kaa saamana kiya, jo shaayad mere jaisaa bura nahin rahaa hoga
 Most of these were in the judges' chambers and there were others around, so it probably didn't get so bad with them
 is mahila ke anusaar, ek ladki ko main jaanati hum, jiskaa lagaataar yon utpeedan hua or isaki vajah se use apane kaam main bhi pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In the end, this woman has questioned whether we can go beyond anger and confess our feelings when faced with sexual violence and accept the complexity of emotions when faced with such incidents
 ghatana ke lagbhag ek saal baad ise ujagar karne ke bare main usne apane blog main likhaa ki haalanki is ghatana se vah behad aahat huin or is vyakti par thodaa krodh bhi hua, lekin use nafrat nahin hui
 Instead she was shocked and hurt that a person, whom she used to respect so much, did such an act

 General elections 2019 are near, and soon after forming the government in three states, the Congress is challenging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to step up for the welfare of farmers across the country by waiving the loans of farmers and coming to the front foot soon

 In fact, the Rythu Bandhu Yojana or Kisan Investment Assistance Scheme (FISS) in Telangana was implemented only on May 10, 2018, under which the state government paid them Rs 8,000 per acre as investment assistance for two crops a year

 33 lakh farmers are being provided assistance of Rs 4,000-4,000 per acre for the Kharif and Rabi seasons, for which the government had allocated Rs 12,000 crore in the 2018-19 state budget
 raythu bandhu yojana apni kism kii desh kii pehali yojana he
 After this, the Raghubar Das government of BJP has recently announced the Chief Minister's Agriculture Scheme in Jharkhand, which will be implemented from the financial year 2019-20

 The incident of November 8, 2014 is hardly forgotten
 chhattisgarh ke bilaspur ke pendari main 137 mahilaon kii nasbandi hui thi
 But the next day 13 women died and more than 50 became ill
 rajnatik bavaal machaa to jaanch report main mahilaon ko di gai dawa ciprocine main chuuhe maarane kii dawa kaa ansh milane kii baat kahi gai
 But the interesting aspect was that there was no mention of poison anywhere in the post-mortem and culture report
 isliye sambhaavna jataai gai ki maut kii vajah sankraman thi kyonki mashin ko sankramamukt nahin kiya gaya tha
 In fact, the reason for these deaths is the lack of willpower in the governments to provide health facilities in India
 swasthya vibhaag se jude ek doctor kehete hai, “bilaspur jaisaa cond isliye hua ki vahaan samuchit saadhan nahin the or doctor ko ummid nahin thi ki itani badi sankhya main log pahunchenge
 "in such a situation, the question arises that in the absence of facilities, how will India, full of diversities, achieve the goal of universal health care or proper health for all?" Of the 1,000 children still born in India, 43 are unable to celebrate their fifth and 37 even their first birthday
 prasav ke dauraan jacchaon kii hone vaali maut kii tasviir bhi bhayaavah he
 Annually 45,000 women die while giving birth to children, which is 17 percent of the world
 yani maatrutiv mrityu dar main kami ke baavjood aaj bhi har ghante paanch maataaon kii maut prasav ke dauraan ho jaati he
 However, the Government of India is gradually taking steps to end this situation and to provide easy, accessible and quality health care to all as part of the global commitment
 lekin teji se badhati arthvyavastha hone ke baavjood bharat swasthya maanakon main apane se kamatar deshon ke mukaable bhi pichhadaa hua he
 India's Total Fertility Rate 2 in the National Family Health Survey - 2005-06 (NFHS-3) lagging behind neighboring and Muslim countries

 Has arrived at 2
 duusari ore bangladesh, bhutan, brazil, china, kuwait, malaysia, nepal, srilanka, turki or america vagairah main yah dar bharat ke mukaable kam he

 4 percent which was sharply reduced to 26 in NFHS-4 ie 2015-16

 Fertility rate in minor girls also decreased from 16 percent to 7
 9 fisadi par aa gai he
 India is the second largest population in the world where there is a lack of awareness about family planning due to the conservative thinking of the society
 ise kai baar rajnatik chashme se dekha jaataa he, isliye kai baar jansankhya niyantran kii koshishon ko ek samudaay vishesh ke prati jodakar dekha jaataa he
 But keeping the figures of Muslim countries in front, the Government of India is going to start a separate initiative, which has been named Mission Family Development
 haalanki is dar par kendriya swasthya rajyamantri anupriya patel india today se kahati hai, “duniya kii 18 fisadi aabaadi bharat main rahati he or itani badi aabaadi hamaare liye badi chunauti he
 Therefore through awareness we will definitely achieve the goal of stabilizing the increasing population rate by 2045
 ” ve kahati hai, “jansankhya vruddhi main bhi kaaphi giravat ai he or jahaan tak prajnan dar kaa sawaal he to hamaara lakshya ise 2
 Have to bring up to 1
 is lakshya ko desh ke 36 rajyon-sangh shasit rajyon main se 24 main to 2
 Have achieved the target of 1 and in the coming time it will be completed in the banked states as well
 iske liye swasthya mantralay saghan abhiyaan shuru kar rahaa he
 "why important family planning? The central government is careful about family planning
" mantralay ke adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki sanjay gandhi ke samay parivaar niyojan kii pahal ko lekar jo galat avadharana bani thi usase abhi tak na to sarkaar ubar pai he or na hi samaaj
 Therefore, instead of implementing it legally, the government is promoting it as an awareness campaign
 bharat apane padosi desh china se sabak lete hue jansankhya niyantran ko lakshya ke rup main nahin lenaa chahta
 The government policy of one child in China led to a decrease in the young population and the number of elderly people increased
 jiske baad china ko apni niti ko lacheela banane ko majaboor hona padaa
 But India wants to stabilize the rising population rate by 2045 through awareness campaign keeping in view its socio-geographical variations

 Fertility rate 2 in the last ten years
 7 fisadi se ghatakar 2
 The reason for coming up to 2 per cent is a huge reduction in unwanted pregnancies
 bharat kii mushkil anchaaha garbh se hi he
 The Ministry of Health believes that if pregnancy occurs by planning with mutual consent, then the fertility rate will naturally decrease and in the coming time India will become its 2nd
 1 fisadi ke lakshya tak pahunch jayega
 The government's strategy is that people should produce as many children according to their potential, but do not have an unwanted pregnancy because it affects the health of both mother and child
 mantralay yah maanata he ki logon main jaankaree, saadhan-suvidhaon or parivaar niyojan ke liye jaruri saamaan ke abhaav kii vajah se bharat main prajnan dar duniya ke kai kamatar deshon se bhi kharaab sthiti main he
 This rate is higher in rural areas than in cities because the facilities are not as accessible as in cities

 For this, the government is giving impetus to mission family development
 ” haalanki is maamle main lakhanu ke doy
 Ram Manohar Lohia, Associate Professor at the Institute of Medical Sciences
 rajani bala kahati hai, “parivaar niyojan kaa kadam saraahneey he
 But more emphasis should be given in rural areas by linking it with other health schemes
 yah ascharyajanak he ki desh ke sabase bade rajya uttar pradesh ke 57 jilon main prajnan dar itani zyada he
 "family planning is not just a means of stopping birth rate or contraception, but it also improves the proper economic standard of the family and especially the health of both the mother and child," she says
 ”man kii baat se pehle parivaar niyojan kii batamishan parivaar vikaas kaarykram kii aupchaarik laanching to pichley saal hi ho gai thi, lekin jameen par isaki shuruyaat is saal jansankhya diwas se hone ja rahi he
 The government has identified 146 such districts in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Assam with the highest fertility rates in the seven states of the country
 inamen se 23 jilon main 4 se zyada to 46 jilon main 3

 The fertility rate in Uttar Pradesh's Shravasti district is more than five
 pehle ke jamaane main gaanvon main yah dharna thi ki bachche mar jaaenge isliye 4-6 paidaa karo
 But the increasing pace of development and changes in lifestyle have changed perceptions
 halanki jaankaree or suvidhaon ke abhaav main abhi bhi aabaadi dar sthir nahin he
 But now the Narendra Modi government is taking steps towards family planning
 jansankhya niyantran diwas 11 july se radio par “ham do” naam se 52 episod kaa saptahik kaarykram shuru ho rahaa he
 Its time has been kept ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Mann Ki Baat radio program on Sunday
 isamen thodaa ganwai put ke saath parivaar niyojan kii kahani, gane, visheshgyon kii salaah, safal danpatiyon se baatcheet or phone kaal se sampark hoga
 Its focus will be exclusively on the Hindi belt areas as the Ministry believes that this is not the case in South India

 If the mother's womb is not ready or the mother herself is not ready for another child after another, then surely the health of the mother as well as the child will be affected
 isliye vaigyanik taur par kaha gaya he ki do bacchon ke bich main teen se paanch saal kaa antaraal hona chahie
 "priyanka further adds," Contraception is necessary for the interval between two children
 This can reduce infant and child mortality

 Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, who has survived by saying there is no documentary evidence in the case to help Lalit Modi, has increased
 congress ke nae khulaase ne naitikta kii duhai dene vaali modi sarkaar kii museebataan bhi jarur badha di he
 But the party does not want to take any hasty step
 raaje ne party alaakaman ko di apni safai main pehle apane saansad putradushyant singh ke lalit modi ke len-dense duuri bana lee thi
 There was no direct attack on Raje, so late, the party high command had to defend Raje
 khud raaje ne kisi tarah ke dastavej or us par hastakshar kii baton se anbhigyata jaahir kii thi
 But the way the opposition Congress has caught the pulse of the issue and has increased the pressure on the government, the condition of the BJP is getting upset in dealing with it
 raaje nahin likh saktin aisi chitthee?haalanki ab bhi bijepi ke sheersh netritv kaa maananaa he ki jis tarah kii bhashaa chitthee main likhi he uski ummid kisi nausikhie rajaneta se bhi nahin kii ja sakati
 In such a situation, Vasundhara Raje can sign a letter with such language, it does not seem right
 party or sangh se jude ek varisht netaa kaa maananaa he, 'raaje raajnneeti kii manjhi hui khilaadi hai or vah kisi bhi surat main is tarah kii bhashaa vaali chitthee likh nahin sakati ki meri gavaahi ko hamaare desh kii jaanch agency yaa sarkaar se saajha na kiya jaae
 'the BJP is still waiting for an inquiry into the letter and signature of Raje and wants to give Raje the benefit of doubt at the moment
 uske peeche party kii raajnneetik majaburi bhi he kyonki raaje rajasthan main ek kshatrap ke rup main sthapit ho chuki hai or unka jabaran istipha karaane kaa matlab party main do-faad karana he
 This is also believed to be the reason for the bjp's top leadership being late in defense of Raje after the initial inaction
 vipaksh ke dabaav main nahin aana chaahati sarkaariske alaava bihar chunaav se pehle is tarah ke istife se siyaasi samar main pichad rahi bijepi ke liye yah ghaatak kadam ho saktaa he
 a senior BJP strategist says that the way Vasundhara Raje's issue came up after External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, it was then decided at the top level in the government and the party that the government should not come under pressure from the opposition
 unka kahana he, 'agar ek baar istipha shuru ho gaya to isamen koi andeh nahin ki aane vaale saal bhar main aise phijul ke maamalon main istipha yaa uski maang kii jhadi lag jaaegi or phir janata main yah maahaul ban jayega ki bhrashtachar kaa paryaay ban gai upie kii tarah endie kaa bhi hashr ho gaya he
 This is the reason why the bjp-government's strategy is to defend Raje and Sushma till the last moment
 lekin aasaan nahin hoga raaje ko bachanahalanki raaje ke maamle main bijepi ne unase spashtikaran maanga he or use dar he ki kahin jis tarah dilli main purv kanoon mantri jitendra singh tomars ne mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko shuru main andhere main rakhaa, usee tarah kahin raaje kii ore se bhi naa ho
 Therefore, the party has clearly asked them to present their side regarding this new revelation
 raaje ke maamle main pehali baar alaakaman str se bachaav karte hue party pravaktaa sudhanshu trivedi ne istife ke sawaal ko kaalpanik bataaya tha, lekin saath main yah bhi joda tha ki is maamle main kuch nae tathy saamne aate hai to party uski jaanch kar aage faisla karegi
 Even now the party's strategy is around this statement
 agar raaje ke maamle main hue chitthee ke khulaase main sachai pai jaati he to bijepi alaakaman ke liye shaayad raaje ko bachaana utana aasaan nahin hoga
 At least Bihar wants to postpone the matter until the party's strategy is clear in the matter that this new revelation against Raje should be deferred till at least Bihar elections and in the meantime the truth can be ascertained through internal investigation
 iske liye party or sarkaar sansad ke monsoon satr ko bhi hangaame kii bhent chadhane dene ke liye taiyaar he kyonki vipakshi congress ne pehle hi is maamle main apni ranneeti spasht kar di he
 a BJP leader says that the Congress uproar will be the same as the BJP did on many issues while in opposition
 in ranneetiyon se itar bijepi philhal naitikta ke masale par buree tarah se ghiri hui dikh rahi he
 On the one hand, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje are accused of helping Lalit Modi absconding with the law of the country, on the other hand Pankaja Munde, the daughter of late Gopinath Munde in Maharashtra and minister in Devendra Fadnavis government, was also accused of scam

 The truth is that if the lock was not opened, the structure would not fall

 Even if the Chandrashekhar government did not fall, the structure could have been avoided by falling
 pradhanmantri chandrashekhar ayodhya par sahmati bana rasta dhundne main sankalp ke saath jute the
 It was unfortunate that his government lasted only four months
 sirf ek sawaal par unhone donon pakshon ko aamane-saamne bitha diya tha ki kya us jagah par masjid se pehle koi hindu dhaancha tha
 There were six rounds of that bilateral dialogue
 sharad pavaar, bhaironsingh shekhavat or mulaayam singh yadav in baithkon main paryvekshak ke taur par aate the
 In the sixth round, when the Muslim side had to give their proof in the denial of the temple's proof, those people did not come

 Later this proved to be true
 rajeev gandhi ne apana chunaav abhiyaan ayodhya se hi shuru kiya or bhaashan main congress party kii patibaddhta "raamarajy'' ke prati duharai
 At that time, Rajiv Gandhi's speech writer was Mani Shankar Aiyar
 unka kahana tha ki mere likhe bhaashan main raamarajy kaa kahin zikr bhi nahin tha
 Rajiv Gandhi might have attached it to himself under the pressure of the atmosphere, so that it would benefit in elections on an emotional level
 kyonki ve yah samaj chuke the ki chunaav bhaawanaaon par lade jate hai

 Have you ever heard that the decision of a court in Azad India has been complied with within forty minutes? On February 1, 1986, in Ayodhya, the district judge of Faizabad orders the opening of the disputed building and the state government for forty minutes

 The court verdict came at 40

 And a magnificent temple will be built on its roof

 Shashank Ghosh is directing the film
 veere di wedding film ko mukhya taur par mahila varg ne pasand kiya
 This film, presenting different aspects of women's lives, has been included in the list of hit films of the year
 veere di wedding main beti ke bold seen par swara bhaskar kii maa ne kya kaha? padhenmovi main 'veere di wedding' main swara bhaskar kaa masterbation seen kaaphi charchaa main rahaa

 Calcutta High Court Judge Justice CS Karnan, who was sentenced to six months in jail for contempt of court, retired on Monday
 madras ucch nyaayalay ke mukhya nyaayadhish sahit anya nyaayadhishon ke khilaaf aarope lagane ke baad karnan kaa tabadalaa kolkata ucch nyaayalay kar diya gaya tha
 Karnan has been on the run ever since the Supreme Court sentenced him on May 9
 kaha ja rahaa he ki ritair hone ke baad karnan kii giraftaar jald ho sakati he
 a seven-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Jagdish Singh Kehar sentenced Karnan to six months in jail, convicting him of contempt
 iske turant baad pashchim bengal police kaa ek dal unhen giraftaar karne ke liye chennai ravaanaa ho gaya, lekin safalataa nahin mili
 Experts are saying that perhaps the police can arrest him now, as he is now retired
 sthiti par pratikriya vyakt karte hue varisht vakil tathaa supreme court baar association ke purv adhyaksh dushyant dave ne kaha ki unka pataa na laga paanaa police kii naakaami ko darshata he
 This shows a complete lack of respect by the authorities towards the Supreme Court
 unhone kaha ki sahi ho yaa galat, sarvocch nyaayalay ke faisle kaa paalan kiya janaa chahie or naakaami ke liye puri tarah rajya jimmedaar he or use javabdeh tehraaya janaa chahie
 The comments mashhoor vakil kamini jaiswal ne kaha ki nyaayamurti karnan ab tak giraftaar se bachate rahe, lekin ab unhen giraftaar kar liya jayega

 ovaisi ne 'ajtak' ke khaas kaarykram 'sidhi baat' main shweta singh se kaha ki agar iske liye kanoon banaaya jaataa he to main uskaa paalan karuunga
 He said that our Constitution gave freedom of speech
 agar aap kanoon bana denge to main jarur 'bharat mata kii jai' lekin aap mujhe majaboor nahin kar sakate hai
 Owaisi further said that you cannot make it a test of my nationality
 unhone aage kaha, 'main jaihind bolne main fakhr mahasoos karata hum
 They did not even fight with the British, since then the slogan has come from Jai Hind
 main apni jindagi apane ghar main kaise gujaarta hum, kya khaataa hum, kya bolta hum, ye privesi kaa adhikaar he

 anti neshnal bhi ek suvidhajanak gaali he
 If there is any disagreement with the government, then tell him anything of these two
 baad main jo inke saath aa jate hai ve secular ho jate hai
 Apart from this, he said that i have always raised voice for the country but if you say that speaking against Modi is against the country then i do not believe it
 ovaisi ne kaha ki modi ko agar aap khuda kaa darja de denge to, lekin main nahin maanata hum
 Earlier, Owaisi was asked if Muslims would be able to stop the way of Narendra Modi in 2019
 is sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki musalmaan pehle se hi pis rahe hai
 The country will have to think whether you will vote for Narendra Modi who promised employment to the youth in 2019 but failed
 ovaisi ne aage kaha ki desh kii suraksha, mahangaai samet anya muddon par modi sarkaar naakaam rahi
 Apart from this, an atmosphere of hatred has been created against Muslims and Dalits
 mujhe lagata he ki hindustan kii awam in muddon par sochakar hi vot karegi
 However, Owaisi also said that regional parties will be able to capitalize on these occasions

 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state president BS Yeddyurappa on Saturday attacked the state's coalition government, saying there were deep differences between these alliance partners which could be revealed soon
 congress ke kuch vidhayakon kaa congress vidhayak dal (sielpi) kii baithak se dur rahanaa is baat kaa sanket he ki aane vaale dinon main jwalamukhi kabhi bhi fat saktaa he
 On the other hand, Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy, who came to attend Mamta Banerjee's rally in Kolkata, said that the government would take away the MLA from BJP in the next 48 hours

 There is no threat to his government
 kumaraswami ne kaha ki bijepi hamaari sarkaar ko asthir karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 We are in touch with our mlas and we have sufficient numbers
 unhone aage kaha ki ham kisi se milane kaa prayaas nahin kar rahe hai
 Such efforts are being done on their behalf
 ham bijepi se 48 ghanton main vidhayak chin lenge
 He said that he is scared of his future in the next Lok Sabha elections and hence is creating problems in Karnataka
 unhone jedies or congress ke vidhayakon ko todane kii koshish kar rahe hai, lekin ve aankade nahin juta paaenge
 Former Chief Minister and BJP leader Yeddyurappa on Friday said that there were deep differences in the alliance after four Congress mlas did not attend the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting
 sielpi ke baad congress ne daawa kiya tha ki vidhayak dal kii baithak main 79 main se 76 vidhayak maujuud rahe
 This meeting was called by the Congress with the intention of demonstrating its power
 yediurppa ne kaha ki congress vidhayak dal kii baithak se congress vidhayakon kii gairmaujuudagi unke vidhayakon main faile prachand gusse or rosh ko dikhaati he
 Siddaramaiah, the leader of the Congress Legislature Party, warned the party mlas of their frustration and fear
 khauf main hai siddharmaiyah yediurppadusari ore, yediurppa ne siddharmaiya par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki aapane jis tarah se vidhayakon ko baithak main shaamil nahin hone par notice bheja he, usase aapaki hataasha ke bare main pataa chalata he
 It shows that you are in awe
 agar vidhayakon ke saath aapkaa sauhardpurn rishta he to aapane notice main yah kyon likhaa ki un par dalbadal kanoon ke tahat karrwai kii jaaegi
 It is known that the three legislatures not included in the Congress meeting on Friday are Ramesh Jarkiholi, Mahesh Kumatahalli and Umesh Jadhav
 vidhayak umesh jadhav ne is baithak main nahin pahunchane par safai dete hue siddharmaiya ko patr likhakar kaha ki unki sehat kharaab hone kii vajah se wo yatra karne main asamarth hai, jiske chalate to baithak main shaamil nahin ho sakenge
 Apart from these b
 nagendra naam ke vidhayak bhi baithak main shaamil nahin hue
 He said that due to a court case he would not be able to attend the meeting of the legislature party
 iske baad siddharmaiya ne kaha tha ki baithak main gaiyrhaazir rahane vaale vidhayakon ko party kaaran bataao notice bhejegi
 The Congress' Sanskritiyedurappa also criticized Congress General Secretary KC Venugopal's remark that Operation Lotus was started in Karnataka in 2008
 yediurppa ne kaha ki yah congress hi thi jisane 'aayaa ram gaya ram' samskruti kii shuruyaat kii thi
 This defective trend of mlas also affected other parties
 unhone kaha ki varsh 1967 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne kaha tha ki 'gaya ram ab aayaa ram ban gaya he'
 In the same year, an MLA from his United Front government joined the party and left the Congress thrice in a span of 15 days
 yediurppane kaha ki behatar yah hoga ki siddharmaiya or venugopal apane raajnneetik itihaas kaa adhyayan karen or yah pataa karen ki haryana main kya hua tha jab congress ne janata party ke 36 vidhayakon kii madad se bhajanlaal kii sarkaar banaai thi
 Yeddyurappa said that it was the Congress that started this culture
 unhone kaha ki aisa lagata he ki siddharmaiya yah bhul gaye hai ki vah bhi isi samskruti ke tahat congress main shaamil hue
 The Bharatiya Janata Party does not have the greed for power

 Delay in getting financial support to the people due to the hesitation of banks / NBFC, NHB said, "state wise division of subsidy data not available
 The Modi government's flagship scheme aimed at 'housing for all' is facing a breaker
" pradhanmantri awaas yojana (shahari) ke tahat pehali baar awaas kharidne ke liye jo log paatr hai unhen sabsidi milane main lanbaa intjaar karnaa pad rahaa he
 These people are the beneficiaries of the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (PMAY-CLSS) under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana
 artiai ke tahat daakhil yachika main neshnal houseing bank (NHB) se PMAY-CLSS ke tahat lambit aavednon kii jaankaree maangi gai
 NHB replied, '1 on 22-08-19
 57 lakh awaas labhaarthiyon ke sabsidi daavon par NHB kii prakriya chal rahi he
 NHB also said in response that state-wise division of subsidy data is not available with them
 sutron ke mutabik, pradhanmantri awaas yojana-shahari PMAY (U) ke tahat sabsidi pradaan karne kii kachua raftaar ke liye bainkon / enbiensi (gaiyr banking vittiya sansthaanon) kii hichkichaahat bhi ek ahm kaaran he
 These show a cold stance on subsidy applications, due to which a large number of such cases are pending
 PMAY (U) kaa lakshya he ki vibhinn aay slab ke tahat pehali baar ghar kharidne waalon ko 6
 a subsidy ranging from 3 to 18 lakh rupees should be provided on a home loan with an interest rate of 5%
 awaas or shahari maamalon ke mantralay ke tahat PMAY (U) ke shikaayat prakoshth ko kai shikaayatein milin, jinamein se 62% sabsidi nahin milane se sambandhit thim
 In 2017-18, 663 complaints were received
 2018-19 main ye sankhya badhkar 1,431 ho gai, jinamein se 907 kaa 12 june 2019 tak samaadhaan ho gaya
 NHB received 1,719 complaints, of which 1,346 were settled and 373 were pending
 pradhanmantri karyaalay kii adhyakshata vaali yojana kii samiksha baithak main adhikariyon ne enechabi ke paas fund kii kami ko ahm kaaran ke taur par ginaya tha lekin jab mantralay ke adhikariyon se pratikriya maangi gai to unhone fund kii kisi bhi kami se inkaar kiya
 He said that subsidy applications are being disposed of in a time bound manner
 iske liye 60,000 karod rupye ke atirikt bajtiy sansaadhan (EBR) aavanton kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 In the current financial year, the budgetary allocation for the housing scheme is Rs 7,000 crore, which has been fully utilized
 sutara is baat kii pushti karte hai ki sabsidi kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye EBR se 28,000 karod rupee nikaale gaye
 Also, the demand for PMAY-CLSS has increased by about 285% this year as compared to FY 2017-18
 adhik dhan kii aapurti ke liye bainkon / NBFC kii hichkichaahat is tathy se spasht he ki july 2019 main, HUDCO ke liye aavashyak EBR ko aarthik maamalon ke vibhaag (DEA) dwaara anumodith nahin kiya gaya
 To achieve the target of 7 lakh beneficiaries, NHB needs Rs 15,400 crore
 isamen se, awaas mantralay kaa daawa he ki 2018-19 main hasil 10,350 karod rupee ke fund ko baant diya gaya he
 In a reply to the Parliament earlier this year, Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had said that by July 2019, the government has subsidized Rs 14,482 crore under PMAY-CLSS
 43 lakh labhaarthiyon ko baant di thi
 Just as many applications (1
 57 lakh) prakriya main hai unhen sabsidi mil jaati he to milakar labhaarthiyon kii sankhya 8 lakh tak pahunch jaaegi
 The target for the financial year 2019-20 is set to cover 10 lakh beneficiaries
 haalanki, awaas or shahari maamalon ke mantralay ne ek baithak main prastaav diya ki is lakshya ko praapt karne ke liye, NHB ko lagbhag 7 lakh labhaarthiyon ko cover karnaa chahie
 At the same time, HUDCO has more than 50,000 and SBI at least 2
 5 lakh labhaarthiyon ko dekhnaa chahie

 He has not told the country what concrete steps have been taken to check this
