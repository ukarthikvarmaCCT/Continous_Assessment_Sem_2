 Actress Nargis Fakhri is out of the country due to ill health
 unke pravaktaa ne kaha he ki iske peeche actor udai chopra se unki sagaai tootna yaa film industry chhodane kaa faisla katai nahin he
 The rumors have got more spice due to Nargis's sudden disappearance from the film industry even from the promotion of her new film 'azhar'
 kuch media report main aisa kaha gaya he ki naragis actor-film nirmaataa udai chopra ke saath apni shaadi kaa elaan karne ja rahi thim, lekin udai ne sagaai tod di
 There are also rumors that she had a 'nervous breakdown' due to a strained relationship and she left the producers of her upcoming films in the balance
 haalanki naragis ke pravaktaa ne kaha he ki aisa nahin he
 An official statement released by the spokesperson said, 'nargis has done a lot of work on three films simultaneously at a time for more than a year
 naragis ko ek samay main ek film karne kii aadat he or ye sab naragis ke liye kuch zyada hi ho gaya he
 'it is being told that he has been ill since the time of promotion of' Azhar '
 unhen kai chotein lagi hui hai
 Due to all these difficulties and fatigue, he had a fever of about 101 degrees since the time of promotion
 pravaktaa ne bhi kaha, 'unki bollywood ko chhodane kii koi yojana nahin he or apni film'banjo' kii shootingke liye vah june ke duusare hafte main lautengi

 aisa isliye kyonki ye donon hi filmein ek hi vishay par bani hui hai or ujadaa chaman ke mekars ne to ye bhi aarope lagaaya tha ki bala ke mekars ne unki kahani churaai he
 However, Ujra Chaman's makers managed to get their film released first

 dekhnaa he ki kya ye film kuch kamaal kar paaegi
 According to trade experts, the first day's business will be around 9 to 10 crores
 jo ki ujadaa chaman ke bijness se takreeban 9 guna zyada he
 It is clear that there is a strong fight between the two films, but it has been seen many times that after the release of several films of the same kind at the same time, either of them has earned better than the rest at the box office
 koun degaa kisko patkhni?lekin baat gum phirakar waapas usee jagah aati he ki yadi public kii taraf se film ko acha riection miltaa he to mouth publicity kii vajah se saadhaaran kii film bhi box offis par asaadhaaran kamai kar jaati he
 It remains to be seen whether Bala can do better at the box office than Ujra Chaman? Or this film will also fall at the Aundhe mouth box office

 ‚Äù 8 june ko nitish kumaar ke argedy-jedy(you) gathbandhan kaa mukhyamantri ummidavaar ghoshit hone ke kuch ghanton baad patna main bijepi ke kendriya netritv ke saath hui rajya kor group ke netaaon kii baithak ke is sandesh se saaf tha ki bihar vidhansabha kaa chunaav bijepi ke liye kis tarah karo yaa maro jaisaa ho gaya he
 This is reflected in the views shared by Dharmendra Pradhan of India Petroleum as a special envoy of Union Petroleum Minister and BJP President Amit Shah, "bihar elections are never separate from contemporary politics
" yahaan kaa chunaav mahaj kisi rajya ke chunaav jaisaa bhi nahin hota he, balki bihar hameshaa nirnaayak janadesh detaa he jo rajya ke saath-saath desh kii raajnneeti ko bhi prabhavit karata he
 "bihar, which has been the laboratory of social justice, has also become important because all the satraps of North India's politics collapsed in Narendra Modi's wave, but this election for Lalu Prasad Yadav and Nitish Kumar became friends with the enemy because of Modi
 Not only will he write his future script but the script for the 2019 general election will also be prepared from here
 agar lalu-nitish ke sameekaran se bijepi ke mansoobey par pani phirata he to agle aam chunaav main nitish kumaar ek vikalp ke taur par modi ke saamne cheharaa ho sakate hai
 The political duo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP national president Amit Shah may well realize this
 antarrashtriya yoga diwas ke maukey par shah khud patna main kaaryakartaaon ke saath is diwas ko manaayenge
 Shah lalu-nitish, who is known to be an expert in micro-political management, is trying to have every possibility of a break in the camp in his favor so that the scattering of votes can weaken the edge of the opposition
 is kadi main shah ne sabase pehle jedy(you) se alag hue purv mukhyamantri jeethanram maanjhi ko endie ke paale main laakar jaateey sameekaran ko guladasta bada kar liya he
 The strategists of the BJP, who are focused on "vibhishan", know very well that it will not be possible to move ahead with the votes the party gets in the Lok Sabha elections
 isliye party puri tarah se duusari party se tuutakar aane waalon par nigaah banaae hue he
 In terms of statistics, there are 89 seats where the JD (U) -RJD candidates were in direct contest in the 2010 assembly elections
 ab in donon dalon kaa gathbandhan he
 On this situation, a senior BJP leader says, "there are two contenders in these seats, who will not get tickets, they will break and we will gain votes from the rebellion
 ‚Äù pichley chunaav tak jedy(you) ke saath gathbandhan hone kii vajah se bijepi 243 main sirf 102 par hi ladati rahi he
 In such a situation, there is a lack of strong candidates to fit the caste equation in front of the party and the party is focusing more on the rebellion in the nitish-lalu camp
 bijepi kii najar argedy se alag hue pappu yadav par bhi he jo endie main shaamil hue bina bhi bijepi ko paroksh rup se phayda pahunchaa sakate hai
 It is just that in the Bihar elections, both the coalitions have started the election campaign with the vision of development, but the reality is that the ground of both has come on the caste equation

 Rajeev Pratap Rudy and Ramkripal Yadav were also formed as part of a strategy to strengthen social alliances following the defeat of Minister Upunithav
 ab lalu-nitish-congress ke gathbandhan ke baad bijepi ne yadav vot ko baantne kii ranneeti par khaas focus kiya he
 The party paid attention to the second generation Yadav leaders except the established or old leaders of the Yadav society and has been included in the party in large numbers
 bijepi kii ore se mukhyamantri pad kii daud main shumaar ek netaa ke mutabik, ‚Äúham 25-30 ummidavaar yadav utaarenge

 The commission has increased this to Rs 40,000

 No penalty will be levied
 interestair has been asked to pay the penalty within one month of receiving the copy of the commission's order

 The District Consumer Forum also asked for a legal expenditure of Rs 7,000 along with a fine of Rs 10,000 on Air India, but the airliner decided to challenge it to the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission instead of following the order
 ayog ne airliner par sakht tippanee karte hue kaha, 'shaakaahaari yatri ko maansaahaari khaanaa parosna na sirf seva kii badi khami he balki bhagwaan kii ankhon main bhi paap he

 Pawar and Supriya have stakes in the company that had failed bids for the IPL Pune team
 yah suzav dene par ki chah hafte pehle ipel vivaad ke shuru hone ke dauraan bhi ve company main apane hiton kaa khulaasa kar sakate the, pavaar or supriya ne kaha ki us samay unhen aisa karne kii jarurat mahasoos nahin hui
 On the report of 16 per cent stake in Pune State City Corporation in the name of himself, his wife and daughter, Pawar said, "I have said before that neither i nor any member of my family is from any IPL team or bidding process
" Is attached and i repeat this statement
 ‚Äôbisisiai ke purv adhyaksh ne jor diya ki company ke prabandh nideshak aniruddh deshpandey ne boli apni vyaktigat kshamta ke aadhaar par lagaai thi
 He told reporters, 'we were not involved in the bidding process in any way
 yahaan tak ki report main mistar deshpandey ne apni sthiti bilkul saaf kar di he
 "the board unanimously decided not to participate in the bid at City Corporation's board meeting," Pawar said
 lekin prabandh nideshak boli prakriya main shaamil hone ko lekar utsuk the isliye unhen vyaktigat taur par shaamil hone kii sweekruti di gai
 "he said," It was made very clear in the board's proposal that no shareholder other than Mr
 Deshpande personally would have any direct or indirect stake
 ‚Äô supriya ne bhi apane parivaar ke bachaav main utarate hue kaha ki pune ipel team ke liye deshpandey kii boli se unka kuch lenaa dena nahin he
 Sahara Group won the Pune team's bid
 unhone poocha, ‚Äòcompany main hamaari hissedari kaaphi kam he or ham board main shaamil nahin hai
 Now if people (deshpande) move without the approval of the board, then where did i join? ‚Äô supriya ne kaha, ‚Äòboard ne boli nahin lagane kaa prastaav paarit kiya tha agar mistar deshpandey phir bhi aage badhanaa chaahate the to yah vyaktigat faisla tha
 We have nothing to do with this
 ‚Äô unhone kaha, ‚Äòhamaare paas dastavej hai jo sabit karte hai ki board ne kisi boli ko sweekruti nahin di thi
 "when asked why any member of the Pawar family did not disclose anything about the bid earlier, Supriya said," See, our bid was not interested and the company was also against it
 yah sabit karne ke liye hamaare paas dastavej hai
 Supriya said that if Pawar had wished, he could have bought the IPL franchise only in 2008 when the Twenty20 League started
 unhone kaha, ‚Äòyaad rakhiye jab ipel shuru hua tab mistar pavaar bisisiai adhyaksh the or agar vah chaahate to pehle satr main hi aasaani se team hasil kar sakate the or vah bhi kuch log jitne paise de rahe hai usase saste main
 It was just that we were not interested in it
 ‚Äô supriya ne in aaropon ko bhi khaarij kar diya ki nilaamee prakriya main deshpandey kaa istemaal praxi ke taur par kiya gaya
 Pawar also denied any rigging in the bidding process, saying that if he used his influence, the company would not have lost the bid from Sahara
 unhone kaha, ‚Äòagar main is sanghathan main kuch hota or apane prabhaav kaa istemaal karata to kya aapako lagata he ki yah boli main harati
 Pawar reiterated that IPL Pakistan is clean and there is nothing wrong in the ownership pattern and financial transactions of the league

 Last time in 2013, India won the title by defeating host England in the final
 iske baavjood kai jaankaar nahin maanate ki team india is baar bhi kitaab kaa sabase majboot daavedaar he
 West Indies superstar Chris Gayle said in a special talk to NDTV that Team India's bid cannot be considered the strongest
 ve kehete hai ki england ke halaat main jo team sabase zyaada abhyast hogi use hi jeet hasil hogi
 Similarly, former Sri Lankan cricketer Chaminda Voss says, "whoever is playing well will have high hopes of winning
 mere hisaab se england kaa naam sabase upar aata he or phir newzealand kaa
 After this, Sri Lanka, Pakistan or India from the subcontinent may also be the winning contenders
 " lekin purv captain sunil gavaskar ne NDTV se khaas baatcheet main bharat ko kitaab kaa sabase majboot daavedaar bataaya
 He says that India, host England and South Africa are the strongest contenders for the title
 ve maanate hai ki team india ke khilaadi lay main hai or toornament shuru hone se haftaa bhar pehle pahunchane se unhen abhyast hone kaa puraa mauqaa he
 They say that the practice match on 28 and 30 May (vs New Zealand and vs Bangladesh at the Oval) will also clear the picture of Team India
 tippaniyan According to former Indian spinner Irapalli Prasanna, due to the strength of Indian bowling, Team India can win the title again
 2002 or 2013 main champion bani team india ke paksh main prasanna daleel dete hai, "mujhe lagata he bharat or australia do sabase zyaada santulit timen hai
 They should reach the finals
 khaaskar bharat kii aakraamak kshamta shandaar nazar aati he
 He has six specialist bowlers
 " unhone ye bhi kaha ki 2013 kii tarah hi is baar bhi aar aswin or aar jadeja team india kii jeet main ahm role adaa karenge
 According to 77-year-old Prasanna (49 Tests, 189 wickets), 20 overs bowled by spinners in a 50-over game can prove to be very important
 irafaan pathan jaise duusare kai bhartiya diggaj team india par daanv laga rahe hai
 While Australian captain Steven Smith is the strongest claim to his team
 yahaan tak ki bangladesh ke captain mashrafe murtaza apni team kii daavedaari behad majboot maanate hai
 However, r Ashwin, who won the title of CEAT cricketer before going to England for the Mission Champions Trophy, said that some new preparations have come for the new tournament
 wo kehete hai ki pakistan ke kilaaf (4 june ko match) match se pehle warm ap maichon main wo apane nae hathiyaar ko maanjane kii koshish karenge
 That is, if the 'new' bet of Ashwin runs, then the danger bell may ring for the opposition team
 isi tarah purv srilankai cricketer chaminda was kehete hai, "jo bhi acha khel rahaa he uske jeetne kii zyaada ummid hogi
 According to me, the name of England comes first and then New Zealand
 iske baad upmahadweep se srilanka, pakistan yaa bharat bhi jeet ke daavedaar ho sakate hai
 "but former captain Sunil Gavaskar, in a special conversation with NDTV, described India as the strongest contender for the title
 unka kahana he ki bharat, mezbaan england or dakshin africa kitaab kii sabase majboot daavedaar timen hai
 They believe that the players of Team India are in rhythm and they have a chance to get acclimated by arriving a week before the tournament starts
 ve kehete hai ki 28 or 30 may ko abhyaas match (vs newzealand or vs bangladesh se ovel main) se bhi team india kii tasviir or saafe ho jaaegi
 The comments purv bhartiya spinner irapalli prasanna ke mutabik bhartiya gendbaazi kii taaqat kii vajah se team india phir se kitaab apane naam kar saktaa he
 Prasanna argues in favor of Team India, championed in 2002 and 2013, "I think India and Australia are the two most balanced teams
" unhen final main pahunchnaa chahie
 In particular, India's offensive capability looks fantastic
 unke paas chah specialist gendbaaz hai
 "he also said that like 2013, r Ashwin and r Jadeja will play an important role in Team India's victory this time too
 77 saal ke prasanna (49 test, 189 wicket) ke mutabik 50 over ke khel main spinners dwaara phenke gaye 20 over behad ahm sabit ho sakate hai
 Many other Indian giants like Irfan Pathan are betting on Team India
 jabaki australian captain steven smith apni team kii daavedaari sabase majboot bataa rahe hai
 Even Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza considers his team's claim to be very strong
 vaise mishan champions trophy ke liye england jane se pehle CEAT cricketer kaa kitaab jeet chuke aar aswin ne kaha ki nae toornament ke liye kuch nai taiyaari karke aae hai
 He says that he will try to get his new weapon in warm-up matches against Pakistan (match on June 4)
 yani aswin kaa 'nayaa' daanv chalaa to vipakshi team ke liye khatare kii ghanti baj sakati he
 According to former Indian spinner Irapalli Prasanna, due to the strength of Indian bowling, Team India can win the title again
 2002 or 2013 main champion bani team india ke paksh main prasanna daleel dete hai, "mujhe lagata he bharat or australia do sabase zyaada santulit timen hai

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to the upcoming Election Special News Letter pakistan diwas ke avasar par yojit samaaroh main kashmiri algaavvaadi netaaon kii shirkat par bavaal machaa hua he
 After the Mufti Mohammad Sayeed government came in, the news of inviting the separatist leader Masrat Alam's release created an uproar and added fuel to the fire
 yah alag baat he ki vah vyaktigat vajahon se dilli nahin aa rahe or isliye shaam ke jalse main shaamil nahin ho rahe
 It is not the case that Kashmiri separatist leaders have been invited for the first time
 unhen har baar is mauqe par nimantrit kiya jaataa he
 Even Masrat Alam has been sent invitations every year
 pakistan hai kamishan ke ek rajanyik ke mutabik, masarrat alam ko jab 2010 main jail hui uske baad unhen nimantran card jail main hi bheja jaataa tha
 Then no one knew Masrat Alam as much as people have known since his release
 is baar hurriyat netaaon ke nimantran ko lekar itnaa bavaal isliye he, kyoking modi sarkaar banane ke baad jab videsh sachiv str kii pehali baatcheet islamabad main honi thi, uske thik pehle pakistan ucchayukta abdul basit ne hurriyat netaaon se dilli main mulaaqaat or baat kii
 The Ministry of External Affairs expressed its deep objection to the cancellation of Foreign Secretary level talks
 bharat or pakistan ke bich baatcheet kii prakriya ek baar phir patari se utar gai
 Before the Cricket World Cup started, Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent the Foreign Secretary on a SAARC visit and s Jaishankar also visited Islamabad in this connection
 isse baatcheet phir patari lautne kii ummid bandhi he
 After the previous objection of the Modi government to the meeting of Pakistan High Commissioner and Kashmiri separatist leaders, the media is watching every such meeting with a microscope
 jabaki pichhali kisi bhi sarkaar ne is mulaaqaaton par kabhi koi aupchaarik aapatti nahin jataai
 It is a different matter that India does not like this kind of meeting, but a country which believes in democratic values never hinders it
 jab bhi pakistan se vahaan ke pradhanmantri, raashtrapati yaa kisi duusare rajanetaaon kaa bharat daura hota he, wo kashmiri algaavvaadiyon se bhi mil kar jate hai
 Reacting even today, the Ministry of External Affairs has not raised any direct question on this meeting, rather it said that there is no Hurriyat or any third party in the solution of Kashmir problem, it is an issue between India and Pakistan
 ise shimla or agra samjhaute ke tahat hi niptaya ja saktaa he, jisamen yuan samet kisi tisare paksh ke dabil ko puri tarah nakaar diya gaya tha
 As an opposition party, the BJP has surrounded the UPA government on the issue of Pakistan, terrorism and separatism
 ab uski khud kii sarkaar he
 In such a situation, the Modi government may have tried to give a harsh message by objecting to the meeting of the Pakistan High commissioner-hurriyat last year, but there was no benefit or result
 aise main ummid kii ja sakati he ki aaj ke jalse main hurriyat ke shaamil hone se baatcheet kii aagaamee sambhaavnaaon par koi roda nahin atakegaa
 It will be interesting for fans of Hindi cinema to know that no Hindi film has been shot yet in Mathura, the birthplace of Sri Krishna

 Director Raj Purohit says, "generally, shooting in up-bihar means buying trouble, but while shooting in Mathura, we did not know what the problem was
 haalanki mathuravasiyon ke liye yah pehla mauka tha jab unke yahaan kisi film kii shooting ho rahi thi, lekin logon ne is kadar sahyog diya ki ham dhanya ho gaye
 Believe the peace with which he was watching our shooting, once in a while the mind did not realize that we are in UP
 vishesh rup se krishna sthali hone ke kaaran mathura ko ek tirth sthaan bhi mana jaataa he, jahaan videshi sailaaniyon kii bheed jamaa rahati he, lekin unki taraf se bhi hamen koi pareshaani nahin uthaani paddy

 To make a person impoverished or rich is in the hands of Shani Dev, because he gives fruits according to human deeds
 agar aap kuch vishesh karmon par dhyaan den to shani swayan aapako dhani bana denge
 Let us know what is the relation of Shani with Dhan Yoga
 shani kaa dhan se sambandh-shani jivan main har prakaar ke shubh-ashubh karmon ke kaarak or faldaata hai
 According to deeds you will be rich or poor, it is decided by Shani Dev
 shani kii vishesh sthitiyon se dhan kii prapti saral ho sakati he or kathin bhi
 The Mahadasha of Shani lasts for nineteen years
 nakaaratmak prabhaav hone par shani lambe samay tak dhan ke liye ksht dete hai
 If Saturn is negative, it gives severe poverty in a half-and-half or dhaiya
 kundali main behatar yoga hone ke baavjood agar karm shubh na hon to shani dhan kii khub haani karavaate hai
 The position of money is determined by the position of Saturn in the horoscope
 kabhi shani vishesh dhan laabh karavaate hai to kabhi bevajaah paison kaa nuksaan bhi karavaate hai
 Therefore, for economic strengthening, it is important to pay attention to the position of Saturn in the horoscope along with the deeds
 to aaie jaanate hai ki shani kab paison kaa nuksaan karavaate hai
 Saturn causes money loss - If Saturn is in the inauspicious mood of the horoscope, then it causes loss of money
 shani neech raashi main hon yaa surya ke saath hon to bhi dhan haani hoti he
 If Saturn's half-and-half or dhaiya is going on then money loss occurs if wearing sapphire gem without advice causes loss of money
 insaan kaa aacharan shuddh naa ho,bujurgon kaa anadar karata ho tab dhan haani hoti he
 When will Shani make you wealthy and Saturn friendly, if he is in the third, sixth or eleventh house, then he makes you rich
 shani ucch ke hon yaa apane ghar main ho to dhan laabh dete hai
 If Mahadasha, Satisati, Dhaiya is moving, wealth is benefited
 vyakti kaa aacharan shuddh ho,aahaar satvik ho dhan laabh karaate hai
 Money is beneficial if parents and elders are blessed

 yah kai baar sochaa he ki muktibodh par likhte hue yah nahin likhuunga ki unki kavita 'andhere main' main aadhi raat ko domaji ustad ke netritv main chal rahaa viraat juluus hamaare aaj ke yatharth kaa pratik he
 It has been said so many times that repeating it seems pointless
 lekin domaji ustad har taraf hai or har baar uksaate hai ki unke bare main kuch kaha jaae
 This time also a Domaji Ustad instigated
 arun jetali ke biimaar or america main hone kii vajah se bajet pesh karne aae piyush goyal ne muktibodh kii kavita-pankti uddhrut kii
 Interestingly, he did not name Muktibodh, simply said that there is a Hindi poet who is from Maharashtra, he has written, 'I keep one foot, hundred paths erupt
 'to pradhanmantri narendra modi kii sarkaar ke antim (antarim) bajet main hindi kavi gajanan madhav muktibodh kaa bhi ek sankshipt or vinamr yogadan he
 This also sheds some light on the poetry of the ministers of the Modi government and its understanding of its use
 yah saafe he ki piyush goyal yaa unke salaahkaaron ne muktibodh ko padhaa bhi nahin hoga
 They will not even know how much the small world of Hindi respects this poet
 unhen kahin se ek 'coteble kot' kii tarah yah pankti mili hogi or unhone iskaa istemaal kar liya hoga
 It states that leaders also need poets
 kuch netaa kavi hone par amada rahete hai
 Many people who are unaware of poetry and its culture feel that Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also a good poet
 kahin-kahin pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kavi hone ke pramaan bhi milte hai
 But this attempt to become a poet has to do with some bright-sounding lines, some potencies
 kavita unke liye istemaal kii aisi vastu he jiskaa kaam sajaavat karnaa he
 It is used for the decoration of a budget speech
 vah sansad main chal rahi kisi bahes ke dauraan kaam main laai ja sakati he- is baat kii parvaah kiye bina ki puri kavita kaa mantavya kya he yaa kavi antat: kidar khadaa he
 Of course, once written, the poem also has its own autonomous personality, which its reader can use in their own separate, sometimes completely opposite meanings
 dushyant kumaar yaa dinakar kii bahut sari panktiyaan vam or dakshin ke pathak ek hi nishtha ke saath duhraate mil sakate hai
 Sometimes it is also possible that the poem stands against the intention of the poet
 lekin bajet bhaashan main muktibodh kii kavy pankti ke istemaal kii vidambnaa kuch badi or virup kyon lagati he? isliye ki na muktibodh ne kabhi chupaaya ki ve ek khaas raajnneetik chetana ke kavi hai or na bijepi ne yah jataane main koi sharmindagi mahasoos kii ki vah is vichaardhaara se nafrat karti he
 However, there are writers and editors among us who express some regret as to why Muktibodh asked the partner's politics
 unhen politics se alag rahanaa chahie tha
 This use of Muktibodh in Piyush Goyal's budget speech may have given him some answers
 darasal kavita kaa yah istemaal kavita ko vyarth karnaa he
 It has to be turned into a political slogan, into a slogan, into a decorative-showpiece
 jo raajnneetik dal yaa juluus dinakar yaa dushyant yaa kisi bhi kavi kaa aisa istemaal karte hai, ve kavita ko chota or bemaani bana daalate hai
 Dhumil once wrote, 'kavita is the man of language
 ' apni kavita gavaan kar, apni bhashaa bhul kar, apni admiyat ko nazarandhaaz kar jab aap ek samaaj kii thekedaari karne nikalate hai to aapako apni baton ko bahut sajaa kar pesh karnaa padataa he- yahaan achaanak kavita se uskaa makasad chin kar, use aap atmavihin kar daalate hai, ek bejaan se jism main badal daalate hai
 Needless to say that not only the leader or businessman or other people deal with poetry, many times they do poets themselves, they do all those who claim to be writers
 kavita unke liye tamge kii tarah hoti he jisamen ve sammaan or puraskaar kii tarah ke kuch or tamge jodna chaahate hai
 Those people also waste poetry
 muktibodh ke sandarbh main yah traasadee kuch zyada hook paidaa karti he
 Like many people like us, poetry was not a place for them, it was not an imaginary place, it was a field of self-confession for them, it was a burning circle in which they entered in such a way that they could not even get out of it
 
 unka bhay, unki vednaa, unka aatmsangharsh unki kavita main itani gahari tahon tak anusyut hai ki unase ham bhi mukt nahin ho pate
 But Piyush Goyal uses Muktibodh with the carelessness that there is no surprise, but suffering
 nihsandeh yah unka nijee kasoor nahin, ise sirf bhaajapai samskruti bataanaa bhi anyaay hoga, yah kul milakar hamaari puri rajnatik samskruti kaa aainaa he- ek aisa aainaa jiskaa zikr bhi khatarnaak hone lagata he
 After all, our poet had said- 'hi, Hi, i have seen them naked, i will get the punishment for it, i will surely get it

 aapako bataa den ki kuldeep naiyar ne apane kariyar kii shuruyaat bataur urdu press reporter kii thi
 He was also the editor of the Delhi newspaper The Statesman
 patrakarita ke alaava vah bataur activist bhi karyrat the
 Kuldeep Nayar was also arrested during the Emergency
 maharashtra-haryana chunaav main bijepi uthaa rahi 370 kaa muddachunavi bhaashan main 370 par jawaab dene se batch rahi he congressbijepi kii sarkaron ko sthaneey muddon par gher rahi he congressjammu-kashmir ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene vaale anuchhed 370 ko hataakar modi sarkaar desh ke saamne yah baat rakh rahi he ki jis vishay par abtak kii sarkarein kadam uthaane se bachati rahi hai, us par bhartiya janata party kii sarkaar ne nirnay liya he
 Assembly elections are being held in Maharashtra and Haryana after the withdrawal of 370 from Kashmir and BJP is highlighting its bold move here
 yah mudda bijepi kaa sabase bada chunavi hathiyaar ban gaya he, jabaki 370 hataane kaa virodh karne vaali congress ke liye bijepi kaa yah brahmastra chunaav kaa sabase bada sirdard sabit hota dikhaai de rahaa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday in Jalgaon, Maharashtra has increased the concern of Congress on this issue
 piem modi ne jansabha se congress samet 370 hataane kaa virodh karne vaale sabhi dalon ko chunauti dete hue kaha ki agar unke andar himmat he to ve apane ghoshnaa-patron main is baat ko shaamil karen ki dhara 370 ko waapas laayaa jayega
 This challenge of PM Modi is considered to be a big problem for the main opposition party Congress in Maharashtra and Haryana elections
 370 par congress kii chintaa uske netaaon ke bayanon main dikhaai de rahi he
 Kumari Selja, who recently took charge of the Haryana BJP, has also focused the question of 370 on Haryana
 shailaja ne rajya kii baat karte hue kaha ki bijepi ne 150 vaade kiye the, lekin pichley paanch saalon main usne ek bhi vaada puraa nahin kiya he
 Shailaja believes that the BJP is raising issues like NRC and Article 370 to divert attention from the issues of its unfulfilled promises in the state
 maharashtra main bole rahul gandhi- chand par rocket bhejne se nahin bharegaa desh ke yuvaaon kaa petitnaa hi nahin, congress lagaataar sthaneey muddon par chunaav ladane kii baat kar rahi he
 While the top leadership of BJP in both Maharashtra and Haryana states are asking their leaders to stand on section 370
 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah apni lagbhag sabhi reliyon main yah mudda uthaa rahe hai or congress netaaon ke naam lekar is par unki party kaa stand puch rahe hai
 Despite this, no response is being given by the Congress on this issue
 ravivaar ko pehali baar maujuuda chunaav ke liye prachaar main utre congress ke purv adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne maharashtra main kai jansabhaayen kin
 Rahul once again raised issues like Rafael, employment, GST and demonetisation but did not respond to the challenge of PM Modi or Amit Shah on Kashmir or Article 370
 haalanki, rahul ne itnaa jarur kaha ki sarkaar 370 or chand kii baat karti he, lekin samasyaon par khamosh he
 That is, all the leaders, from the top leadership of the Congress to the leaders of the state, are giving preference to local issues with farmers and employment, avoiding to say or answer on a national issue like Section 370
 jabaki haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter to spasht taur par kah chuke hai ki unka sabase bada chunavi mudda dhara 370 hi he

 From Bharatiya Janata Party President Amit Shah to many Union Ministers will also hold press conferences in many parts of the country
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi apatkaal ko lekar aaj kai saare twit kiye
 After the Emergency was enacted, leaders were imprisoned for nearly two years in the country, freedom of the press was banned and forced sterilization was implemented
 isi daur main sangharsh or andolan kar ubhare kai netaa aaj desh main bade padon par hai
 Many veteran leaders including Nitish Kumar, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Arun Jaitley, Lalu Prasad Yadav came in everyone's eyes during the Emergency
 lekin aaj bhi logon ke man main sawaal uthta he ki jab apatkaal lagu tha to pradhanmantri narendra modi us dauraan kahaan the or kya kar rahe the
 PM Modi himself has repeatedly mentioned and criticized the Emergency period in his speeches
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii website narendramodi
 Some stories from the era of emergency have been told on in
 kya kar rahe the PM modi?apatkaal lagu hone ke baad kai netaaon ko giraftaar kiya ja rahaa tha, us dauraan aresas puri tarah se sakriy tha or underground rahakar kaam kar rahaa tha
 Like other RSS pracharaks, Narendra Modi was also entrusted with the responsibility of making arrangements for movement, conferences, meetings, distribution of literature, etc
 un dinon modi nath laal jagarh ke saath-saath vasant gajendra gadkar ke saath sakriy rup se kaam kar rahe the
 The RSS was also banned during the Emergency and many Sangh pracharaks were arrested

 Sanjay Gandhi wanted to keep the Emergency in force in the country for 35 years, Indira made the election change work by modifying Modi but Modi then took another senior person of the RSS, Natha Lal Jagda, to a safe place by taking him on a scooter
 immergency ke dauraan soochna prasaaran puri tarah se band tha, lekin modi ne samvidhan, kanoon, congress sarkaar kii jyadatiyon ke bare main jaankaree yukt sahitya gujarat se anya rajyon ke liye jane vaali trainon main rakhwai

 On September 1, 1939, Germany launched an air raid on Poland which continued to Belgium, Holland and France
 poland, belgium, holland or france ke baad germany ne june 1940 ko britain par hamalaa kar diya
 Germany used 1200 fighters in this major strike, in response to which Britain had only 600 Spitfires and Hurricane Fighter

 hamane unase khaas baatcheet kii he or jaanane kii koshish kii he ki is ap kaa bhavishya kya he
 Question: What is the story behind making Saraha app? jain-al Abedin: When i started corporate life after graduation, i noticed that there is a need for constructive feedback in office
 aise plateform kii jarurat mahasoos hui jahaan feedback dene vaale kii pahchaan jaahir na ho
 Because for this all the barriers are like, Omar and Post
 sabase acchhee baat he ki aap bina pahchaan bataae feedback den
 At first i thought what could be the solution
 feedback ke liye desk par sajeshan yaa feedback box bhi rakhaa ja saktaa he, lekin main computer science student hum or mujhe laga ki ise automatic banaaya ja saktaa he
 That's why i appreciated it
 saraahaa launch karne se pehle hi maine sochaa ki ise sirf offis ke liye nahin balki frends or family ke liye bhi laayaa jaae jisase sab ek duusare ke saath imaanadaaree ke saath rah saken

 Many new features will be added
 sabase khaas baat is ap kii ye he ki yah construkative feedback ke jariye kiya jane vaale self development ap he
 We have some surprises that the customers are very fond of
 ham ye nahin bataa sakate ki wo kya he, kyonki phir majaa nahin aayega
 Question: People are afraid that this app will reveal the identity of the sender in the coming time
 logon ke ye bhi sawaal hai ki paise lekar logon kii pahchaan jaahir kii jaaegi
 Zayn al-abedin: Not at all
 hamaare paas kadi privesi policy he or ham kisi bhi keemat par kisi shaks kii aaidendity kabhi jaahir nahin kar sakate
 However, if someone wishes, we can identify
 yaa agar koi isaki aad main niyamon kaa ulanghan kar rahaa he to bhi ham pahchaan jaahir kar sakate hai
 But if people follow the rules then no identity will be revealed
 sawaal:block feechar kaise kaam karata he?jain-al aabedin :block feechar ko kaaphi sikret rakhaa gaya he
 Because if we told how the block works, then the wrong users will take advantage of it

 fasebuk ne baad main in sampadakon ko hataa diya or santulan banane ke liye ek elgoridam kaa istemaal kiya, jo yah faisla letaa tha ki kin hedlins ko trending section main rakhaa jaae
 But by sorting the headlines by algorithms, many fake news and objectionable content were also found in the trending feature of Facebook

 Now in this case they will need to appear only on the direction of the court
 adaalat main peshi ke liye pahunche lalu yadav ne media se duuri banaaye rakhi or koi bayaan nahin diya
 The removal of Lalu Prasad's son Tejashwi Yadav from the coalition government in Bihar after the Central Bureau of Investigation lodged an FIR on several of his family members, including Lalu Yadav, his wife Rabdi Devi, daughter Misa Bharti and Deputy Chief Minister son Tejashwi Yadav

 sisitivi main doctor kaa girebaan pakad kar ghasitate najar aayaa shaks karnataka ke bijepi empi anant kumaar hegade hai
 Netaji has taken the form of this rage only because after arriving at the hospital to get his mother treated, he felt that the doctors were not responding

 In this way, he bled the doctors one by one

 pichley teen hafton se aisa lagata he ki arvind kejariwal or puri aam aadmi party kaa ab ek hi agenda he or vah he modi
 Earlier the Aam Aadmi Party had some issues, but now Modi has only one issue and one agenda
 rohtak or kanpur raily ke baad modi ke garh gujarat main ghuskar kejariwal ne koshish kii ki gujarat ke vikaas ke daawey kii hawa nikaalkar unhen hilaa den
 Kejriwal is trying to break into the anti-modi and anti-bjp vote by shaking Modi and calling himself the biggest force against him
 modi hile nahin hile hilenge yaa nahin pataa nahin, lekin kahin aisa naa ho ki kejariwal is chakkar main khud hill jaaen
 In fact, after the assembly elections in Delhi, the rapid political change that Kejriwal had to form and topple the government and then had to go to the Lok Sabha elections, it seems that the party wants to get a lot in a very short time, but this a kind of dissatisfaction is being seen in the party these days
 yah asantosh netaaon se lekar kaaryakartaaon sabamein dikh rahaa he
 The news comes on the day that such and such, who were the founding members of the party, resigned from the party for some reason
 ho saktaa he ki party chunaav ke liye tikat na de rahi ho isliye ve party se naaraaz hokar party chhod rahe hon ye aam baat he, lekin jab aam aadmi party ke netaa kumaar vishwaas or shazia ilmi bhi party se naaraaz dikhen to kya kaha jaae
 The problem of Kumar Vishwas is that a big responsibility is being given by bringing anyone in the party and because he is the founder and elder leader of the party, his resentment can be understood, but the question is whether to give any consideration to this natural resentment Whether it is ready or not
 shazia ilmi se party chaahati thi ki ve sonia gandhi ke khilaaf raibareli se chunaav laden, lekin shazia dilli se chunaav ladanaa chaahati thim
 But candidates were declared on all the seats in Delhi and Shazia was not given ticket by the party from Delhi
 vaise to kumaar vishwaas kii tarah shazia kii naaraazgi bhi swaabhaavik he
 But if it happens in all the parties then what is different in this party
 ye party to daawa karti he ki wo maujuuda raajnneeti ko badalane ke liye or deshseva karne ke liye raajnneeti main aae hai to phir jab desh seva ke liye aae hai to isamen naaraazgi kyon
 Actually, the thing that is making the party workers and leaders restless is why and how they are bringing party tickets to new people by ignoring old people, who is being brought into the organization, why is it being brought and how Is going
 ek baat or he jisaki bhanak mujhe lag rahi he, lekin abhi puri tarah se wo pukhta nahin ho pai wo ye ki congress virodh se janm lene vaali party or dilli main congress kaa supada saafe karne vaali party is tarah achaanak modi virodh ke alaava kuch soch hi nahin rahi party main is baat par kuch asahmati he
 And the public also asks the workers and leaders of the party that not only is there Congress in the Bhaiya government, instead of opposing it, you are attacking the BJP in opposition as if it was their rule till date and today They are responsible for every problem
 beshak kejariwal kehete hai ki agar kisi ko party chhodkar kal janaa he to aaj chalaa jaae, lekin agar is tarah log party main baichaiyn honge, naaraaz honge yaa party ko salaam namaste kahkar nikalate rahenge to janata or party samatharkon ke man main shaq to zarur paidaa hota he
 They think that there will be some reason why there is no infidelity
 yani agar aapke apane log aapako chhodte rahe or uski vajah se aapkaa janata main maujuud samarthan khisakta chalaa gaya to phir aap raajnneeti kiski karenge isliye mujhe lagata he ki bukamp laakar duusare kii zamin hilaane se pehle zaruri he ki jis jameen par aapkaa ghar he usko majboot karke hilne se bachaaen

 i know very well to keep my emotion under control
 mujhe is baat kii behad khushi he ki mere naam ke upar laga daag hat gaya he
 (played against South Africa in 2000) In my last Test match when i hit a century, i was fully fit and could play another two years
 yahi ek cheez thi jo in saalon main mujhe lagaataar salti rahi
 i was hoping that my ordeal would end soon
 lekin shaayad use abhi hi jaakar khatm hona tha
 i would have been happier if it had ended earlier
 lekin aapako hameshaa dhairya banaae rakhana hota he kyonki bhavishya main uskaa behatar nateeja hota he
 My religion also teaches me the same
 bich-bich main aisa bhi samay aata he jab hamen had darje tak kasuti par ksaa jaataa he
 Then you have to prove how much patience you have
 mujhe us vakt badi tilamilaahat mahasoos hoti thi jab kuch log tivi par ek visheshgy ke rup main khel ke bare main baat karte vakt mere bare main batangad banane kii koshish karte the
 i think people took a lot of leeway about me
 har kisi ko apni roji-roti kamaane kaa haq he, yahaan tak ki kaidiyon ko bhi kaam ke badale paise milte hai
 But i never put any question mark on anyone, tolerated everything
 mushkil main funsane par aap khud hi bahut sari chijen sikhte hai
 Very few people stood by me in bad times
 main kisi par iljaam nahin laga rahaa
 When you are accused, people will not want to come in contact with you, they will try to stay away
 unhen is baat kaa andeshaa rahegaa ki kahin unhen bhi na lapet liya jaae
 But all this is your own personal opinion
 main us aadmi kaa hameshaa saath duungaa jo mushkil main funs gaya he kyonki aise hi vakt main to aapako madad kii jarurat hoti he
 But i have no complaint with anyone
 main kisi se bhi yah ummid nahin karata tha ki vah mere samarthan main kuch kahe
 Kapil Paji, (marhoom) Raj Singh Dungarpur, Kamal Morarka, etc
 really supported me
 kai aise log bhi hai jinhone parade ke peeche rahakar meraa samarthan kiya, lekin ye teen log vastav main majbootee se mere saath khadey rahe
 Not only India, my fans around the world kept calling me and sending messages
 ab meraa sabase bada kaam muradabad ke logon kii seva karnaa he kyonki unke prati meri badi jimmedaari he
 Not only because i am an MP from there, but also because my feelings are attached to them
 mujhe ab bhi yaad he ki jab chunaav ke liye tikat hasil karne ke baad main pehali baar vahaan gaya to logon ne mere prati jabardast pyaar or lagaav dikhaaya
 People were pushing to get closer to me
 mere sharir ko itani dhakka-mukki to us vakt bhi nahin jhelni padi thi jab main kheltaa tha
 i felt that i would have to do something good in order to attain the blessings of Allah
 beeti baaten bhuulakar ab main aage bad chukaa hum
 i was repeatedly asked if i regretted not playing the 100th Test of my career
 dekhie, recordon kii parvaah maine kabhi bhi nahin kii
 When you play for a long time, records are made and they break even one day
 log poochhate hai ki 100waan test na khel paane kaa dukh to hoga hi
 On this i tell him that it is also a pleasure for me to play 99 Tests because there are very few players who play so much
 pratibandh ke dauraan maine kabhi yah koshish nahin ki mujhe kahin cricket khilne kaa mauka mil jaae
 Apart from a few mps' matches and a Veteran series, i did not get to play anything more special
 kisi ko dili dukh pahunchaae bagaiyr main aapako yah bataanaa chaahunga ki saansadon ke ye maitri match koi bahut rochak nahin hote
 He asked me to be the captain of his team but it is very difficult to captain him
 main sirf khel kaa majaa lenaa chahta tha or vastav main mujhe pakistani waiterns ke saath siries main ballebaaji karne main khaasaa majaa aayaa tha
 These were not very thorny matches, but you already know how the game between India and Pakistan is generally
 maje ke liye ravivaar ko bhi match khilne main mujhe jhijak nahin hoti
 i still try to spend my time in the same routine as i have done in my whole life - like going to the gym
 mere liye fitness koi ek baar kii cheez nahin balki jeevanabhar chalane vaali cheez he
 You cannot do this that you lose weight in 15 days and eat it for the next six months
 aapako hameshaa yah dekhnaa hoga ki aap dinabhar main do se teen baar khaanaa kis tarah se khate hai
 Now that i am 49 years old, given my fitness, i can still think about playing if i want to, but i don't think i have any desire to play anymore
 haa, agar mujhe mauka mila to main cricket kaa apana gyaan yuvaaon ke bich jarur baantnaa chaahunga

 ‚Äî Sid (@sidmallya)september 14, 2014 Against the backdrop of the government's move to remove several provisions of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir and divide the state into two union territories, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday that 'we do not avoid problems, we do not avoid them
 ' pradhanmantri ne 73wein swatantraaa diwas ke avasar par laal kile kii pracheer se desh ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, ‚Äòham samasyaon ko taalte bhi nahin or paalate bhi nahin hai
 Now is neither the time to postpone nor the time to raise
 sarkaar banane ke 70 dinon bheetar sansad ke donon sadanon ne anuchhed 370 or 35e ko hataane kaa nirnay kaa anumodan kiya
 PM Modi said that we fulfilled Sardar Patel's dream by abolishing Article 370
 piem modi ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòdeshavaasiyon ne jo kaam diya, ham use puraa kar rahe hai
 He said that every government made some efforts to restructure Jammu and Kashmir, but the results have not been achieved as per the wish
 modi ne kaha, ‚Äòjammu-kashmir or ladakh ke sapanom ko pankh lagen, yah ham sabaki jimmedaari he
 Apart from this, the Prime Minister said, "those people who are advocating Article 370 are asking the country that if it was so important then why didn't you make it permanent, why keep it temporary?" It has not been 10 weeks to the new government, but in this short tenure, every effort has been made in all areas, we are serving with full dedication
 'piem modi ne kaha ki muslim mahilaon ko nyaay dilaane ke liye teen talaak ke khilaaf kanoon banaaya gaya or aatankwaad ke khilaaf majbootee se ladaai ladane ke liye aatankwaad virdohi kanoon main sanshodhan kiya gaya
 This is Modi's sixth consecutive address and the first address after coming back to power from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day

 Then how can it be said that new jobs will not be available? In one year, PM Modi said, referring to the data of the Employees' Provident Fund (EPFO) That 45 lakh new accounts have been opened and 5 during the last 9 months
 68 lakh log nai pension skim se jude hai
 This shows that more than 1 crore people have got employment in the last year
 piem ne kaha ki rojgaar ko lekar chalaaya ja rahaa dushprachaar ab band hona chaiye

 desh main electronic udyog ke kshetra main hone vaale vikaas kii charchaa karte huepiem modi ne kahaaki saal 2014 main mobile nirmaan ke do upkram the, jo ab badhkar 120 ho gaye hai
 The PM asked the kind of development that has been seen in the electronics sector, would not it have created jobs? He said that today India is moving towards becoming the center of start ups
 logisticks, i-commers, mobile ap aadhaarit agrigaters kii aaj bharmaar he to kya ye nae rojgaar kaa srijan nahin kar rahe hai?piem modi ne kaha ki paryaton kaa kshetra bhi bade rojgaar ke avasar paidaa karata he
 There has been a 14 percent increase in the number of tourists in the last year, so would it not have created new jobs? 'jai hind' se apana sambodhan shuru karne vaale desh kearmy chif general bikram singh ne india today conclevamein kaha ki logon ko apane army ke bare main jaananaa chahie
 The Army is not the only name of the soldiers carrying arms
 unhone kaha ki army ko keval aantarik-suraksha ke rup main nahin dekha janaa chahie
 He also said that we use weapons like tanks within the country
 bikram singh ne bataaya ki army secularism main sarvocch sthaan rakhata he
 The religion of our soldiers is the religion of its commanding officer
 saath hi army ling samanta ke liye bhi patibaddh he
 He said that the army has the greatest contribution in ending any kind of schism in the country
 party nahin desh ko samay den netaa: dow
 Regarding the soldiers and martyrs devoted to Kalamdesh, he said that 22443 jcos have died since independence
 in shaheedon ko inaki pahchaan milani chahie
 There is no greater value than the security of the country but remembering the martyrs is also very important
 unhone aage kaha ki sena se sevanivruth hue jawan dhakad prabandhak hote hai, desh ko chahie ki wo unako kaamon main lagaaein
 With all these, we have increased the value of the country
 unhone kaha ki aane vaale samay main aap dekhenge ki hamaare jawan or padak jitkar desh ko nyochaavar kar rahe hai
 Army Chief Bikram Singh said that security personnel are working on the basic needs of women and children in those areas affected by infiltration
 seemaa se lage kuch rajyon main eexspie kanoon kaa samarthan karte hue unhone kaha ki yah sahi samay nahin hoga ki eexspie ko hataaya jaae
 He said that this issue should not be politicized because it will not be our decision to remove AFSPA, we can only make suggestions
 zyada karj ke kaaran karj kii sthiti: raghuram rajanbikram singh ne kaha ki siachin hamaara he, phir ham apane hi ilaake ke bare main aise kyon baat karen ki yah kisi or ko diya ja rahaa he
 This is contrary to logic
 logon se sawaal ke rup main poochhate hue bikram singh kehete hai ki koun he jo maranaa chahta? vah aage kehete hai ki ham kashmir ke liye khushi-khushi mar janaa chaahate hai
 We are there because the country needs us
 pakistan ke ravaiye par do took bolte hue unhone kaha ki kargil ko lekar pakistan ne apni galati kabhi nahin maani or ab musharraf kehete hai ki haa, wo seemaa se 11 kimi aage tak aa gaye the
 You can never accuse us of breaking faith
 aap bharat main aatank ko bhejne kii niti ko jari nahin rakh sakate
 In the instructive tone to Pakistan, you said that you have double standards
 bhartiya loktantr main behatar badlaav kii gunjaaish: arun puriconklev main aae pakistani patrakaron ko sambodhit karte hue unhone kaha ki ladaai hamaari niti main nahin he

 # ishaambani for # voguewomenoftheyear! @vardannayaka post shared by Nita Mukesh Ambani (@nitamambani) on Sep 24, 2017 at 10:10am PDT The case of gang rape of a young woman in Dehli Gate area of meerut on Wednesday has turned out to be fake
 darasal, yuvati ne jin teen logon ko aaropee banaaya tha unamem se ek aaropee do varsh pehle hui ek hatya ke maamle main gavaah tha
 It is said that a man named Haji Margub tried to buy that witness first and when it did not happen, a conspiracy was hatched to implicate him in a false case of rape
 police ne choubees ghanton ke bheetar jhuthegangrepaki gutthi ko sulajhaakar aarope lagane vaali yuvati samet kul chaar logon ko giraftaar kar liya he
 According to the police, conflicting elements were appearing in the investigation from the beginning
 police ne jab guuruuvaar ko yuvati kaa bayaan darj kiya to usne kaha ki aarthik tangi ke kaaran maragub ke kehane par usne paison ke laalach main juthi report darj karai thi
 Along with this, he also clarified that he does not have any cousin named Chandra Prakash in Meerut but that Chandra Prakash is an accomplice of Najakat, a murder convict in jail
 kathith rape ke vakt pizza kha rahi thi yuvatiyuvati ne buudhvaar ko aarope lagaaya tha ki teen logon ne uski lassi main nashila padaarth milkaar ek agyaat sthaan par uske sathgangrape kiya
 But when the police started the investigation, it was found that while she was reported to be unconscious, at the same time she was eating jizza in a restaurant with Chandra Prakash and Margub
 sisitivi footage main isaki pushti hui he
 Not only this, the investigation has revealed that the woman has neither husband nor children, even though she claimed in this regard on Wednesday
 yuvati ne pehle kaha tha ki jab use aspataal le jaaya gaya to vah behosh thi, lekin jila aspataal kii sisitivi footage main is jhooth kaa bhi pardaafash ho gaya
 Police have taken the woman and three others Haji Margub Ali, Abdul Ali and Chandra Prakash Kogirattarkar in the case

 Nitish Kumar may be holding the agrarian revolution in Bihar, but Narendra Modi has now made preparations to break into this impregnable fort of Nitish
 narendra modi, bihar main indradhanushi kranti ke agua rahe bihar ke 76 un kisaanon ko sammanit karne ja rahe hai, jinhone haal ke saalon main bihar kii krishi kii tasviir badalakar rakh di
 Narendra Modi has invited these farmers to the Vibrant Gujarat Agriculture Summit 2013 to be held in Gandhinagar, Gujarat on 9-10 September
 isi summit main kheti kii disha badalane vaale kisaanon ko modi apane haathon se sammanit karenge
 How politics shows color, Nitish and Modi stand separately in the name of secularism, whereas Modi's bet is enough to tease Nitish
 darasal, bihar sarkaar ke krishi mantralay ke adheen aanevaala 'bameti' yani bihar krishi prabandhan prasar evam prabandhan santhaan aise kisaanon ko chun rahaa he, jo narendra modi ke haathon ye puraskaar lenge
 Nitish made a lot of headlines by naming the second Green Revolution (indradhanush Revolution) in the state
 lekin nitish ke is dream project se moti chunakar siyaasi rang dene kii modi kii puri taiyaari he
 This scheme of Modi is being seen by connecting his village and farmer in Bihar with his attempt to establish direct communication with them
 isse pehle sardaar patel kii murti banane ko lekar gaanv-gaanv se loha maangane ko lekar pehle hi bihar main raajnneeti tej ho chuki he
 Clearly, angry with Nitish, he was already on the target of Modi, now Modi is busy in getting Nitish's friends too
 bameti ke nideshak rajkumaar singh ke mutabik, 'gujarat sarkaar kaa aamantran mil chukaa he, is summit main bihar ke prayek jile se do pragatisheel kisaanon ko bheja jayega, jise chunane kii prakriya bhi shuru ho chuki he

 2007 main ritair hone ke baad unhone modi ke khilaaf khuli muhim chalaane ke liye tista sitalwad ke citigens for justise and pis jaise enjio se haath mila liya

 ve kehete hai ki ritair hone ke baad ve gandhinagar main isliye rah gaye taaki dangapiditon ko nyaay dilaa saken

 Tung piercing has become a fashion statement for the youth
 jeebh chhidwakar studs pahananaa yaa phir choti si bali pahananaa unke liye khud ko stylish sabit karne kaa ek tarika he
 While tongue piercing has made its place among the youth, experts say that it can cause many serious problems related to teeth
 visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki tang pierassing karaane se masudo par chot lagati he or haddi ke damege hone kaa khatra bad jaataa he
 Experts say that due to tongue piercing, you keep moving your tongue around the mouth throughout the day
 isaki vajah se masoodon main sankraman ho saktaa he
 Due to which there can also be a risk of bone loss
 canada ke uniwarsity of alberta ke doctor liraan ke anusaar ye sthiti khatarnaak sabit ho sakati he
 One of the disadvantages of this can also be that piercing can break from your mouth into your stomach or then get stuck in a placenta
 kai baar aisa bhi hota he ki raat ko sote vakt daant ke neeche kuch kathor sa aane par ham use dabaane lag jate hai
 If the piercing is not broken, then the teeth have to be damaged
 is research ke liye jitne bhi logon se pearsing ko lekar feedback maanga gaya unamem se 51
 9 percent said that piercing causes swelling in their mouths and 45
 7 pratishat logon ne kaha ki pearsing kii vajah se unke munh main khun aata he
 During the inspection of their mouths during research, 14 percent of them got their teeth fractured and 26
 6 pratishat logon main masoode peeche khisak chuke the
 You will be surprised to know that the people who did the piercing did not even know that such harm could be caused by the piercing
 shodhakartaaon kaa kahana he ki pearsing karaane waalon ko is baat kaa khyaal rakhana chahie ki ve samay-samay par doctor ke paas jate rahe taaki kisi bhi tarah kii samasya hone par use turant thik kiya ja sake
 Many problems related to the nervous system also go home in those who conduct the piercing
 un donon main koi samanta nahin he
 One is North and the other is South
 phir bhi amritsar ke sargarmi bhare chunavi paridrishy main unamem kaaphi samanthaayen bhi najar aati hai
 From Amritsar on the 10th of April, Congress candidate Amarinder Singh and BJP candidate Arun Jaitley shook hands with each other to mingle with voters during the "morning walk" at Company Bagh
 us samay unki mithi or choud muskaan ko dekh kaha nahin ja saktaa tha ki abhi do hafte pehle hi sikhon ke is pavitra shahar kii loksabhaa seat par kabja karne ke liye donon ke bich baari katutaa or vaimnasy kii ladaai kaa daur shuru hua he
 Well, after the initial etiquette and the teas of tea at the knowledgeable tea stall, the two leaders set off on their routine of flaunting each other
 13 april ko amritsar ke hindu bahul, dakshin ke bahari ilaake main sau phuti road par chunaav abhiyaan ke antim din apane pratidwandvi amarinder kii bahuprachaarit ‚Äò‚Äòshanoshaukat‚Äô‚Äô vaali jivan style par jetali ne dilli ke punjabi lahaze main kataaksh kiya, ‚Äò‚Äòcandidet da charittar kii he, dekh lena (ummidavaar ke charitra kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana)
 In saffron-colored silk kurta and Aligarhi pajam√©, Delhi lawyer Jaitley seems to agree with his party man who compared 72-year-old Amarinder Singh to "a fat and stray buffalo" who won the election
 The latter will never be seen in the city
 do din baad hi amarinder ne jetali par palatwaar karte hue unhen ‚Äò‚Äònimna maansik str‚Äô‚Äô vaala aisa shaks qaraar diya, jise amritsar ke longon kii samasyaon ke bare main thodaa-sa bhi gyaan nahin he
 For many years, bjp's veteran strategist Jaitley has been preferred by Narendra Modi since 2002 to hand over the command of the Gujarat assembly elections
 61 varshiya jetali pehali baar loksabhaa chunaav ladgaye ja rahe hai
 He sees this as an opportunity in his political career that will take him to a new height
 ve kehete hai, ‚Äò‚Äòyahaan logon ko centre main narendra modi kii sarkaar banane kii sambhaavna najar aati he or ve mahasoos karte hai ki agar main us sarkaar kaa hissaa hua to amritsar kaa vikaas teji se hoga
 "when Jaitley held his first election rally in Attari on the indo-pakistan border, state Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal called him" the future Deputy Prime Minister or Finance Minister of the country ", Jaitley then smiled
 Were
 us vakt tak vah asambhav bhi nahin lag rahaa tha, balki bahut aasaan lag rahaa tha kyonki tab tak congress vahaan ke liye apane pratyaashee kaa faisla nahin kar pai thi
 But the same evening, Amarinder stood up to Jaitley and snatched his smile in one stroke
 upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne punjab ke purv mukhyamantri amarinder ko amritsar se pratyaashee banane kaa daanv khelaa
 In this way, in the Lok Sabha elections, one of the seats which has become a question of prestige, has also become Amritsar
 amarinder maidan main utre to ve bakhubi jaan rahe the ki yah koi saadhaaran chunaav nahin he balki sonia gandhi kii pratishtha bhi yahaan daanv par lagi he
 The Congress president's decision to field Amarinder was a shock to both the parties
 ek taraf jahaan rajya kii maranasann party ikai main nai jaan aa gai vahiin pratidwandvi bijepi kheme main ghabrahat fail gai
 Above all, this decision has curbed Modi's election efforts
 yahaan tak ki jetali jaise varisht netaa amritsar main hi bane rahane ko majaboor ho gaye
 bjp's media manager in Amritsar, Jarnadan also confirms, "jaitley ji is in Amritsar, except for a brief tour of Delhi in the initial phase of the campaign and will be here till the voting on 30 April
 ‚Äô‚Äôcongress kheme kii baat karen to 28 march ko jab amarinder amritsar pahunche to unka baari swaagat hua
 One reason for this is his charismatic personality
 duusari taraf saat saal se rajya main sattarudh shiromani akali dal-bijepi sarkaar se oobe sthaneey matadaataaon ne bhi unka joardaar swaagat kiya
 Here Amarinder played the same bet in which he is a master - that is, to challenge the power of the Akalis
 unhone kataaksh kiya, ‚Äò‚Äòis bandar se koun darataa he?‚Äô‚Äô unka ishaara asal main up-mukhyamantri surajeet singh badal ke saale or jetali ke mukhya chunaav sahaayak bikramjit majithia kii ore tha
 Majithia coinage runs in Majh (area north of Beas river) of Punjab
 amarinder ne maaz ke logon kii bhaawanaaon ko chune kii koshish karte hue jetali ko ‚Äò‚Äòbahari‚Äô‚Äô shaks qaraar diya, jinhen amritsar ke nivaasiyon par jabaran thope diya gaya he
 He was also constantly reminded of the sudden removal of BJP MP Navjot Sidhu from here
 yah tathy siddhu ke kai samarthakon ko bhi saal rahaa he or is vajah se ve jetali ke prachaar abhiyaan se bhi dur rah rahe hai
 Even his good friend and former cricketer Sidhu has decided not to help Jaitley
 algaavvaadi dal khalsa ke sanyojak kanvarpal singh kehete hai, ‚Äò‚Äòyahaan ke logon ko baagi log pasand aate hai
 He says that most of the youth associated with the Khalistan movement were from Amritsar, so it is not a coincidence
 to kya amarinder aisi bhaawanaaon ko bhunaanaa chaahate hai? unka jawaab hota he, ‚Äò‚Äònahin, main to punjab main esaidi-bijepi ke kushasan ke khilaaf khadaa ho rahaa hum
 The former Punjab chief minister also does not forget to remind voters how he left the Congress in June 1984 in protest against Operation Blue Star
 ve yah kahana bhi nahin bhoolatey ki laalkrishna adwani jaise bijepi ke varisht netaaon ne bhi sikhon ke pavitra sthal par sena ke hamale kaa samarthan kiya tha
 They also accuse Chief Minister Badal of having agreed to it
 aise nirvachan kshetra main jahaan 64 fisadi matadaata sikh hon, vahaan amarinder or unke samarthak unke keshadhari yani pagadidhari hone ko adhiktam bhunaanaa chaahate hai
 After Amarinder's landing, Jaitley is trying his best to make up for the weak pitch he has been on
 ‚Äò‚Äòbahari‚Äô‚Äô hone ke aarope kaa khandan karte hue ve kehete hai, ‚Äò‚Äòyahaan unke 40 se zyada rishtedaar rahete hai, jinke paas ve aate rahete hai
 "from the political point of view, they also connect with Punjab and tell that they have made Amritsar their base
 14 april ko unhone india today ko bataaya, ‚Äò‚Äòamarinder bhale hi punjab ke hon, lekin ve amritsar ke nahin hai or ve aise netaa to nishchit rup se nahin hai, jo janata ko sahaj uplabdh ho
 More than 300 of Jaitley's "friends" are in the city to help him
 inamen zyaadaatar dilli ke kaarobaari or vakil hai
 Jaitley's media manager Janardhan says that when the election draws near, hundreds of RSS workers will also be brought here by filling trucks, who will campaign from house to house in the five assembly constituencies of this Lok Sabha constituency in the style of Aam Aadmi Party
 janardan yah bhi bataanaa nahin bhoolatey ki ‚Äò‚Äòham celebrities ko bhi yahaan prachaar ke liye laa rahe hai
 Bollywood actor Sunil Shetty addressed a rally here on 12 April
 jald hi sani deol, ajay devgan or kaajol ke bhi yahaan aane kii ummid he
 But any real star who can turn the wave in favor of BJP is Narendra Modi who is going to hold a public meeting in Amritsar on 24th April
 jetali ko bhi puraa bharosa he ki tabhi khel badalegaa
 "nothing can stop Modi's growing mass base in the country," he says
 jaise-jaise chunaav paas aa rahe hai, dotarafa najar aane vaali ladaai asal main ekatarfa ho jaaegi
 "at present, the election campaign in Amritsar has become like a festival
 hotalon ke saare kamare bhar gaye hai or aitihaasik kesar da dhaba main khaane waalon kii qatari khatm nahin ho rahi
 Here people find a place to sit, shoving each other and the topic of their discussion is "who will win?" Along with them, we will know the answer to this question only on 16 May

 ''sahab bivi or gangster 3 kaa tiger, sanjay ne likhaa- ji haa main hum khalanaayakasunil dutt kaa role nibhaane ko lekar paresh rawal ne kaha ki unka sunil dutt ke saath kuch daivik sambandh he
 In this sequence, he further said that "on June 25, 2005, i was shooting a film
 is dauraan maine apni bivi ko kol kar re bataaya ki aaj mujhe aane main der ho jaaegi
 During the shooting, i received the sad news of Dutt Saheb's death and when i made a call to tell his wife about the news of his going home, i came to know that Sunil Dutt Sahab had sent a letter for me
 xxrep 4 ' ye khabar sun kar main stabdh rah gaya
 Dutt saheb wishes me a happy birthday in the letter
 hairaani is baat kii thi ki ham donon ne kabhi diwaali or holi par bhi ek duusare ko vish nahin kiya tha
 i may have met Dutt Sahab 2-3 times, but i did not know him personally
 saath hi is baat se main or soch main tha ki meraa janmdin 30 may ko hota he or dutt sahab ne mujhe 25 ko khat likh kar bheja tha
 "sunil Dutt used to walk around the jail in the memory of son Sanjay
" When Rajkumar Hirani brought this role to me on January 3, 2017, i became convinced that there was a unique relationship between me and Dutt Saheb
 
 maine apni wif se kuch documents nikaalane ko bole the
 Incidentally i received the same letter in those documents the same day
 tajjub kii baat ye he ki itane dinon se wo khat hamaare paas tha par usee din wo hamaare haath achaanak se laga
 i also shared this thing with Rajkumar
 '' Mayawati, the Bahujan Samaj Party chief and four-time chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, made up her mind to interact with the media after a long gap of several months
 india today ke pramukh samvaadadaata piyush babele se baatcheet main bispi supremeo puri tarah se sarvajan samaaj ke pahrue ke taur par najar ain
 When he called the Congress anti-dalit, the SP was completely called the party of the Yadavs
 baatcheet ke pramukh ansh:‚Ä¢pramotion main aarakshan bill loksabhaa main paarit nahin ho sakaa
 How do you see this whole incident? The UPA government at the center is anti-sc / ST
 congress kii dalit virdohi maansikta main koi badlaav nahin aayaa he
 Reservation in promotion is not something new
 samvidhan nirmaataa baba sahib ambedkar ke prayaason se 1955 se hi yah vyavastha desh main lagu he
 Whenever i was the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, this system was in force in the state
 sthiti badali he 19 aktubar, 2006 ke supreme court ke nirnay ke baad
 In this judgment, the Supreme Court imposed three such conditions, after which it was almost impossible for SC / ST to give reservation in promotion
 lekin isaki jimmedaari bhi congress kii he
 The Government would have made good lawyers and would have put the right before the Honorable Supreme Court, this situation would not have come
 ‚Ä¢lekin loksabhaa main mantri ke haath se bill chhinane kii koshish kar rahe samaajawaadee party saansad kaa haath to khud congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne pakadaa
 This is all Congress drama
 congress ko bill paas karana tha to sarkaar loksabhaa adhyaksh se sadan main marshall bulaane kii maang kar sakati thi
 This has happened before in Parliament on the issue of Women's Reservation Bill
 sonia gandhi kaa haath pakadia or congress kaa hallaa machaana sab naatak he
 ‚Ä¢ As aggressively as your party is supporting the reservation bill in the promotion, will your upper caste voter not be spoiled? Upper cast people are sensible
 unhen pataa he ki yah vidheyak samvidhan kii mul bhaavana ke anukool he
 It is being opposed only in Uttar Pradesh
 samaajawaadee party ne kuch ritair afasaron ko pakad liya he, ve hi yah naatak kar rahe hai
 The SP itself is getting locks in offices
 is puure andolan main sapa ne bade paimaane par paisa bahaya he
 If this is not the case, then why is there no opposition to the reservation bill in other states besides UP
 baaki rajyon main bhi to aprcast ke log rahete hai
 You understand that the people of the upper cast have no problem with the reservation
 ‚Ä¢par is puure ghatnakram se aapaki chhavi ko dalit samarthak or apper cast virdohi banane kaa prayaas to hi rahaa he
 i have always kept the interest of the whole society high
 sapa kii tarah sirf yadav samaaj kaa hit dhyaan main nahin rakhaa
 The SP describes itself as a backward party, but backward only becomes Yadav when this party comes to power
let me make it main saaf kar duun ki main yadav samaaj kii virdohi nahin hum, lekin sapa sarkaar sirf yadavon kii sarkaar he
 When we came to power in Uttar Pradesh in 2007, the first thing we did was to lift the ban on recruitment in government jobs
 hamane jitani naukariyaan deen unamem se 30 se 35 lakh naukariyaan to apper cast waalon ko milin
 ‚Ä¢ But SP is also a strong supporter of Muslims
 sapa ne musalamaanon ko sirf dhokhaa diya he
 Before the 2012 assembly elections in UP, the SP promised to give 18 percent reservation in jobs to Muslims in terms of population ratio, so now give reservation
 ham puraa samarthan dene ko taiyaar hai
 Keep the promise, who stops? The Sachar Committee report should be implemented
 iske liye bhi ham centre or rajya ko puraa samarthan denge
 But their intention is flawed
 1995 main jab meri sarkaar thi to obisi cote main hamane pichde musalamaanon ko shaamil karaayaa tha
 But the Yadavs got all the benefit of the backward during sp's rule
 ‚Ä¢akhilesh yadav sarkaar ke maujuuda kaamkaaj kii reating aap kii najar main kya he?akhilesh ko mukhyamantri bane kareeb nau maheene ho gaye hai
 This government has failed on every front
 isamen har str par karpshan failaa hua he
 Even corruption is being investigated in the work done during our tenure
 pradesh main chori, dakaiti, apharan apane charam par hai
 Since Akhilesh has been sitting on the chair, more than 1,500 cases of rape have been reported in the state
 puure pradesh main 100 se zyada sampradayik dange ho chuke hai, inamen se dedh darjan dange aise rahe jo bade paimaane par hue or sabaki najar main aae
 The situation is deteriorating continuously
 thanon main peediton kii exiar tak nahin likhi ja rahi
 ‚Ä¢ And how do you rate your four terms? i have continuously worked for the interest of the society and have made every effort
 ‚Ä¢uttar pradesh se aap akeli dalit mukhyamantri rahi hai
 In such a situation, the expectations of Dalit society increase from you
 is samaaj ke utthan ke liye aapane kitna-kya kiya?main har kaam sarv samaaj ko dhyaan main rakhkar karti hum
 Whenever i was in government, i did a lot for all classes
 ‚Ä¢loksabhaa chunaav ke liye aapaki kya taiyaari he?ham taiyaar hai
 Let elections take place today, we will contest today
 ham puri tarah taiyaar hai
 ‚Ä¢ What are the things on the top of your agenda for the next six months or a year? The issue of women's safety is very important
 upi main to mahilaon par julm ho rahe hai, desh kii rajdhani dilli bhi mahilaon ke liye surakshit nahin
 The Center enacted strict laws against atrocities on women
 in kanoonon kii publicity bhi acchhee tarah se kii jaae
 The government generally does not give the necessary publicity to the laws of female interest
 ‚Ä¢aap bhi maanati hai ki centre kii congress sarkaar sibiai kaa durupyog karti he?congress hi kyon, bhaajapa bhi sibiai kaa durupyog karti rahi he
 Both these parties have been in power at the Center and both have heavily abused the CBI
 ‚Ä¢aap par bhi sibiai kaa dabaav padaa?ab to hamaare upar kori cese nahin he
 During the time of BJP government in 2003, a case of Taj Corridor was imposed on us
 yah sab siyaasi sajeesh ke tahat hamen pareshaan karne kii koshish thi
 We tried to intimidate us through the CBI, but we never got buried
 ‚Ä¢gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main narendra modi kii jeet par aapaki kya pratikriya he?is par hamen kya kahana he? yah bhaajapa kaa andruni maamla he
 (however, on the very next day of this conversation, Mayawati wrote a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, calling for a special session of Parliament to enact a law on women's harassment
 patr main mayawati ne kaha ki bhaajapa narendra modi ko pradhanmantri banane kaa sapana dekh rahi he, lekin ham uske ye mansoobey puure nahin hone denge

 India has strongly countered Pakistan Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, who is crying in the UN about the Kashmir issue
 bharat ye jawaab dene ke apane adhikaar kaa istemaal karte hue pakistan kaa sara kaccha chittha duniya ke saamne rakhaa or pakistan ko techristaan qaraar diya
 These 10 revelations by Indian diplomat Enem Gambhir in the United Nations made Pakistan's reality in front of the world
 1
 Pakistan is now 'terristan'
 vah aatank kaa paryaay ban chukaa he
 There is a flourishing industry that produces and exports global terrorism
 2
 It is so strange that the country which has patronized Osama bin Laden and has given shelter to Mullah Omar, that country is calling itself a victim
 
 3
 pakistan ke sabhi padosi tathyon ko tod-marodane, dhoortta, beyimaani tathaa chal-kapat par aadhaarit kahaniyaan taiyaar karne kii uski chaalon se bhaleebhanti parichit hai or pareshaan hai
 4
 vaikalpik tathyon ko taiyaar karne ke prayaason se vaastaviktaa nahin badal jaati
 5
 pakistan apane chote se itihaas main aatank kaa paryaay ban chukaa he
 6
 vartmaan sthiti kaa andaja isi tathy se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki lashkar e taiyaba jise sanyukt raashtra ne aatanki sanghathan ghoshit kiya he, uskaa pramukh hafiz mohammad said ab raajnneetik dal kaa netaa banane kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 7
 isamen se kuch bhi pakistan kejammu-kashmir rajyapar laalach bhari najar daalane ke prayaason ko sahi sabit nahin kar saktaa, jammu-kashmir hameshaa bharat kaa abhinn hissaa he or rahegaa
 No matter how much Pakistan increases cross-border terrorism, it will never succeed in reducing India's territorial integrity
 8
 Terroristan is an area whose contribution to the globalization of terror cannot be compared
 9
 Pakistan can only be explained that it should abandon the idea of destroying the world as it has suffered all over the world
 10
 If he can be explained that if he shows commitment to civilization, order and peace, then only he can get acceptance in the union of nations with common interests
 isse pehle, videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne pakistan par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 On the sidelines of the UNGA meeting, Sushma said that countries in South Asia are helping and giving asylum to terrorists who use them for their own interests

 swaraj ne kaha ki aatankwaad ko videsh niti ke rup main istemaal karne vaale desh aatanki sanghathanon ko samarthan or panaah de rahe hai
 She was speaking at the BRICS ministerial meeting at the UN General Assembly on terrorist organizations posing a threat to global peace and security
