 com / qurflrmlzn — ANI UP (@aninewsup) November 11, 2016 jharkhand main sarkaar banane ke liye congress or jeemem ke bich gathbandhan par sahmati ban chuki he or donon dalon ke netaaon ne rajya main sarkaar banane ke pahaluon par charchaa kii
 The alliance can be announced soon through a joint statement
 gauratlab he ki jharkhand main 18 janvari se raashtrapati shashan laga hua he
 President's rule was imposed on January 8 after JMM withdrew support to the BJP government led by Chief Minister Arjun Munda
 pradesh main sarkaar banane yaa raashtrapati shashan kii avadhi badhaane ke bare main faisla 18 july se pehle lenaa hoga
 The possibility of Hemant Soren, the son of JMM leader Shibu Soren, as the next Chief Minister is considered to be strong
 vah guuruuvaar subah congress mukhyalay pahunche jahaan congress mahasachiv evam pradesh maamalon ke prabharee bi ke hariprasad se unki lambii baatcheet hui
 There have been reports of Hemant meeting Sonia Gandhi for the last few days but he has not got time from Sonia yet
 bataaya jaataa he ki jab vah hariprasad se milane aaye tab bhi unhen congress mukhyalay main kareeb ek ghante tak intjaar karnaa padaa jiske baad gathbandhan ko lekar gadabadi kii atakalein shuru ho gayin
 However, the leaders of both parties rejected such notions and said that there is a strong possibility of alliances
 sutron ne kaha ki congress is bare main jeemem se spasht aashwaasan chaahati he ki nai sarkaar ko chah nirdaleey vidhayakon kaa samarthan praapt hoga
 There is also talk of the appointment of Congress Legislature Party leader Rajinder Prasad Singh as Deputy Chief Minister, but no such indication has been given by the Congress for the moment
 purv kendriya mantri or jharkhand se loksabhaa main congress ke ek maatr sadsy subodh kaant sahay ne bhi hariprasad se mulaakaat kii
 Sahay said that more than forming a government for the Congress, an alliance is necessary for the next Lok Sabha elections
 jeemem ke sutron ne kaha ki party 14 loksabhaa siton main se 10 siten congress ko dene ke liye taiyaar ho gayi he jisamen congress ko argedy ko bhi santusht karnaa hoga
 Hemant Soren made it clear during his previous meetings with Congress leaders that an alliance for Lok Sabha elections cannot be formed until a congress-jmm coalition government is formed in the state
 sutron ne kaha ki donon dal ek saajha nunatam kaarykram par bhi kaam karenge
 The last Lok Sabha elections were fought separately by both parties
 jisamen congress ko ek or jhamumo ko do siton se santosh karnaa padaa tha
 Earlier in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, both the parties contested together and the Congress won six seats while the JMM won four seats
 tab argedy or bhakpa ne gathbandhan main chunaav ladaa tha or kramash: do or ek siten jiti thim
 In this way, UPA had 12 Lok Sabha members from the state
 81 sadasyeey vidhansabha main jeemem ke 18 or congress ke 13 sadsy hai
 They would need the support of 11 more mlas
 rajya main argedy ke paanch vidhayak hai
 RJD chief Lalu Prasad has assured both JMM and Congress to support the new government
 bhakpa-emel (el), marxist cardination party, jharkhand party (ikkaa), jharkhand janaadhar manch or jai bharat samta party ke vidhansabha main ek-ek sadsy hai or ek nirdaleey vidhayak bhi he
 There was political instability in the state when bjp's coalition partner JMM formally announced withdrawal of support in a letter to the Governor on January 8, after which the bjp-led government came into minority
 saal 2000 main bihar se alag pradesh banaaye jane ke baad se jharkhand asthirataa ke daur se gujarata rahaa he or yahaan 2009 or 2010 main bhi raashtrapati shashan lag chukaa he
 There have been two heart-wrenching murder cases in the capital Delhi
 new osmanpur thana ilaake main jahaan 5 saal ke maasoom ke saamne uske pita ko badmaashon ne goli markar kar maut ke ghat utaar diya
 In the Welcome area of east Delhi, some miscreants first opened air firing and then a man named Mehtab entered and shot at the house
 jisase uski maut ho gai
 The first case is of New Osmanpur police station area
 jahaan mritak kii pahchaan akibuddin ke taur par hui he
 Akibuddin is said to be the driver of the DTC bus
 badmaashon kii goli mritak kii aankh ke paas bhi lagi he
 It is being told that Akibuddin was returning home from somewhere along with his sister and 5-year-old son at around 10 pm
 ghar ke paas jab akimuddin apane bete ke saath ek dukaan par par ruk gaya
 At the same time, his sister moved towards the house
 isi dauraan logon kaa kahana he ki maukey par pehle se 5 log alag-alag bike par maujuud the
 It is alleged that these people shot the deceased driver
 aropiyon main ek mahila kaa bhi naam saamne aa rahaa he
 The driver has 6 children
 philhal police is puure maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he lekin badi baat ye bhi he ki jis jagah is puri vaardaat ko anjaam diya gaya, vahaan se thane kii duuri bamushkil 200 meter thi
 Rehmat, the sister of the deceased, says that the whole plan was executed
 vaardaat sabit karti he ki badmaashon main police kaa bhi koi khauf nahin he
 In the second murder in a few hours, in the second incident, some miscreants in the Welcome area of north East Delhi first opened fire and shot and killed a man named Mehtab
 is firing main ghatnasthal par maujuud ek or shaks ko bhi goli lag gai
 The injured person is undergoing treatment at GTB Hospital

 He earlier defeated Italy in 1994 and the Netherlands in 1998 in this way
 vah lagaataar chathe vishwa cap main antim aath main jagah banane main safal rahaa he
 The Brazilian team, initially seen under pressure, appeared under some pressure at the start of the game and could not play openly in their familiar style but they slowly gained momentum
 paanch baar ke champion ne 18wein minute main hi badhat banaakar apane padosi desh par dabaav banaaya
 Luis played the role of Neymar, who made a great move from the left end of Brazil
 thigo silva ne use chile ke gol ke kareeb pahunchaaya lekin yahaan par luies ne apni furti or teji dikhaakar gonjalo jaaraa par dabaav badha diya
 He finally managed to deliver the ball into the goal
 bhale hi tab aisa lag rahaa tha ki gend ne jaali main ulajhane se pehle jaaraa ke ghutane ko chuaa tha lekin referi ne yah gol luies ke naam kiya

 unhone chile kii rakshapankti main kushaltapurvak send lagaai lekin unka shot baayen chor se baahar chalaa gaya
 But Chilean fans got a chance to celebrate
 brazili rakshapankti teetar bitar ho gai or jiskaa chile ne puraa phayda uthaaya
 Sanchez got the ball inside the box and then he only had goalkeeper Julia Caesar in front of him, who had no problem in tricking him
 is tarah se 32wein minute main score 1-1 se baraabar ho gaya
 The second half was also interesting
 In the second half also there was an interesting battle between the two teams
 halk ne 55wein minute main gol kar diya tha lekin referi ne use ‘handball’ qaraar diya or is brazili footballar ko pilaa card dikhaa diya
 Chile had a golden opportunity to take the lead in the 64th minute when Caesar defended the threat of Brazil with a beautiful save from Charles Aranguiz
 brazil ne iske baad kuch achche prayaas kiye
 Fried in place of Fred who failed to land a shot on Hulk's cross in the 75th minute
 iske baad chile ke golkeeper braavo ke behtareen prayaas se brazil badhat hasil nahin kar paaya
 Chile's captain Neymar and Hulk saved him from scoring with a sharp shot
 match jab atirikt samay main khinchaa brazil ne adhiktar samay gend par kabja banaaye rakhaa
 Meanwhile, he also made some attacks on the Chilean goal but his efforts were thwarted by Bravo's promptness
 is bich chile ne apni puri takat gol bachaane main laga di thi
 He only got a good chance in the meantime
 chile ko 105wein minute main box ke kareeb se free hit mili thi lekin sanches kaa shot baahar chalaa gaya

 It also eliminates the spectacular achievements of the UPA government, which have been achieved through the implementation of the Right to Information Act, by keeping the proposed authority out of the purview of RTI
 congress asamanjas main he ki vah is pahal par kya pratikriya de
 Due to his proximity to Rahul Gandhi, Congress leaders are unable to decide whether it is Natarajan's own over-enthusiasm or an inflated test balloon in his name

 Legislation made after Citizenship Amendment Bill: After the approval of President Ram Nath Kovind, the law continues in the northeast
 Despite the protests and protests, the Citizenship Amendment Bill has now become law
 loksabhaa or rajyasabha se bill ke paas hone ke baad raashtrapati ramnath kovind ne ise manjuuri de di he, jiske baad ab ye kanoon ban gaya he
 That is, hindu-jain-buddhist-sikh-christian-parsi refugees from pakistan-bangladesh-afghanistan will be able to easily gain citizenship of India
 is bill ko kendriya grih mantri amit shah ne pehle loksabhaa, phir rajyasabha main pesh kiya tha
 After several hours of heated debate, the bill was passed in the House, the Modi government had a majority in the Lok Sabha but despite not having a majority in the Rajya Sabha, the government has won
 naagarikta sanshodhan bill ko lekar virodh kyon ho rahaa he, ab kya nayaa kanoon ban gaya he or kya badalane vaala he
 Take this look
 
 
 kya he naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon?naagarikta adhinium, 1955 main badlaav karne ke liye centre sarkaar naagarikta sanshodhan bill lekar ai
 This changed with the enactment of the bill
 ab pakistan, bangladesh, afghanistan se aae hue hindu-jain-buddha-sikh-isai-parsi sharnaarthiyon ko bharat kii naagarikta milane main aasaani hogi
 Till now they were considered illegal refugees
 pehle bharat kii naagarikta lene par 11 saal bharat main rahanaa anivaary hota tha, lekin ab ye samay gata kar 6 saal kar diya gaya he
 The President approved the bill, but refugees will benefit? Union Home Minister Amit Shah in his speech in Parliament claimed that there are millions of people who will benefit from this law
 nae kanoon ke mutabik, ye sabhi sharnaarthiyon par lagu hoga chaahe wo kisi bhi taarikh se aae hon
 That is, from the date he arrives in India, he will be considered a citizen of India

 Where will this law not apply? This law of Modi government is being strongly opposed in the Northeast
 assam, meghalaya samet kai rajyon main log sadakon par utre hue hai or lagaataar bill ko waapas lene kii maang kar rahe hai
 However, while implementing the law, the government has also announced that the law will not be applicable in some areas of Meghalaya, Assam, Arunachal, Manipur
 sthaneey logon kii maang ke kaaran centre sarkaar ne yahaninar line permitjari kiya he, isaki vajah se ye niyam yahaan lagu nahin honge
 Northeast states say that if the refugees are given citizenship here, their identity, culture will be affected
 inner line permit ek yatra dastavej he, jise bharat sarkaar apane nagarikon ke liye jari karti he, taaki wo kisi sangrakshit kshetra main nirdhaarit avadhi ke liye yatra kar saken
 Why is the law being opposed? This law is being strongly opposed, people are attacking the government from the road to the Parliament
 congress samet kai vipakshi partiyaan is kanoon ko samvidhan kaa ulanghan kah rahi hai or bharat ke mul vichaaron ke khilaaf bataa rahi hai
 Congress had also opposed the bill in Parliament and countered that the bill violates Article 14, which provides for the resolution of equal citizenship
 sirf congress nahin balki kai vakil, vichaarkon ne bhi is bill ko kanoon kaa ulanghan bataaya he
 According to legal information, this bill violates not only article 14, but also article 5, article 21
 is bill ke virodh main kai yachikaayen supreme court main bhi lagu ho gai hai
 The allegation of the opposition is that the government is preparing for NRC by bringing CAB first, which is against the minorities
 kanoonee nazariye se alag purvottaramen is bill kaa virodh isliye ho rahaa he, kyonki iskaa asar unki asmita par pad rahaa he
 Many student organizations in the Northeast say that if outsiders settle in other states including assam-arunachal, their language, identity, culture will be affected and it will be a big loss

 If the urban Indian man has a great appetite for pornographic films, then the Indian woman also stands at a respectable distance of three hands behind him
 62 fisadi purush ashleel sahitya ko sweekaar karte hai, yah nai baat nahin he
 Interestingly, one in five women accept it
 yahi nahin, chaar main se ek ise dekhati bhi he
 It is also interesting to note that among those who have watched pornographic movies, one in four women (23 per cent) are unmarried and three in one woman (29 per cent) are married
 yadi yah jaananaa ho ki ashleel filmein gharelu udyog ke rup main fal-phool rahi hai to iskaa subut yah haih paanch main se ek mahila ne ashleel film ghar par hi dekhi
 And about half of them enjoyed it in the bedroom at home, 45 percent of which women learned from new pornographic pornography

 Pornography is no longer prohibited
 Writer and publisher Urvashi Butalia feels that it is a mixed form of curiosity and experimentation that is not limited to the privileged class

 In times of recession, pornographic films have provided business opportunities in India
 har umr main ashleelata kii apni paribhaasha hahar umr main ashleelata kii apni paribhaasha he
 In a country where pornographic comedy is being masked by family films and children are watching them with teary eyes, but on-screen kissing scenes are still news, its definition is still being worked out
 is par bhi gaur karen
 If pornography in air-conditioned homes is being accepted as a Kamlipsa growth factor, it is being constructed by pressurizing them into damp rooms to financially support terrorism
 vaise bhartiya purushon, mahilaon ko ashleel filmon main desi ladki or desi ladke ko dekhnaa usee tarah pasand he jis tarah se namchin hastiyon ko
 But the danger is that the more they watch such films, the more they will become devoid of emotions

 kaash inamen se ek kisaan neerav modi, mehul chaukasee kii tarah chaalaak hota to kitne kisaanon kii jaan bachaa letaa
 Ram Raj, a farmer who came from Bundelkhand in Lucknow today climbed a tree in an attempt to commit suicide when the government there was going to present the budget to bring Ram Raj to UP
 agar ram raaj ko neerav modi jaise game karne aata to vah bhi daavos main kiraaye kaa kaala suut pahanakar pradhanmantri ke peeche khadaa photo khinchaa rahaa hota
 See this picture of how the policemen are saving a farmer by crying for his son that Ram Raj come, your son is crying
 krishi arthshaastri devendra sharma ne hisaab lagaaya he ki agar dedh lakh tak kaa karza maaf kar diya jaae to is 11000 karod se 30 lakh kisaan karz mukt ho jaaenge
 a loan of one and a half million is on Ram Raj, he came to Lucknow to die, Nirav Modi went to New York with a lime of 11000 crores, went to Switzerland before which it is said that there is a house of black money, and he goes to Davos and Takes a photo with the Prime Minister
 hamane kisaanon se baat kii ki ve neerav modi ke is karaamaat yani chamatkaar par kya sochate hai
 In the press conference of 15 February, Ravi Shankar Prasad said that Nirav Modi did not accompany the Prime Minister, but was brought by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)
 magar jab aap google karenge to 2016 kii ek khabar milegi
 According to this news of Financial Express, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley went to Davos that year with 100 industrialists
 kai naam chape hai, ek naam neerav modi kaa bhi he
 On 13 January 2016, this news was released from the news agency PTI, which has been published by many newspapers
 16 farvari 2018 yani aaj ke times of india ke si unnikrishnan ne khabar likhi he ki 2016 ke saal main neerav modi ko 48 karod kii penalty deni padi thi kyonki disambar 2014 main 1000 karod kaa hira dikhaa kar smagaling kar rahe the
 The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, DRI served a case for two years, then had to pay a fine of 48 crores
 sawaal yah he ki itani badi chori ke baad kya diarai ne aage kii jaanch kii yaa sirf isi maamle tak khud ko simit rakhaa
 The case of smuggling continued, yet how the man went to Davos in 2016 with the Finance Minister
 sibiai jaanch shuru karne ja rahi thi phir yah neerav modi pradhanmantri modi ke saath photo frem main maujuud he
 Perhaps that's why Ravi Shankar Prasad was saying that there should be no politics of photos, so that people do not know
 wo jab press conference karne aae hi the to yah sab bataanaa chahie tha
 May not have gone with the Prime Minister, but who sent the goods worth 1000 crores out of theft to Davos with the Finance Minister, is it okay? neerav modi neuyark ke hotel main hai
 His shop has been raided in Delhi
 lekin unki dukaan to duniya ke kai deshon main he
 Are there raids too? aisi koi khabar suni he aapane? maamla kai companiyaan banaakar heere ke kaarobaar ke naam par paisa idhar se udhar karne kaa he
 Nothing will prove to be regretted because there must be a big event to end this news
 koi hangaamaa yaa koi bavaal
 Our colleague Namrata Brar went on the 36th floor of JW Marriott in New York and tried to get Nirav Modi to talk, put forward his case and not succeed
 godi media ne turant khabar likhnaa shuru kar diya ki 5000 karod baraamad ho gaye
 You have to understand this game
 maal zabt hua he, keemat tay hone main kai maheene se lekar saal lag jate hai
 You can ask any Income Tax Officer
 lekin yah bhi pataa chal rahaa he ki chaape kii team main jawaharaat ke export bhi hai jo saath kaa saath daam bhi bataa de rahe hai
 Whatever it is, the raid is on the shops of India, but the hotel where Nirav Modi is in has his another store in New York, there are shops in many countries of the world, are there raids too
 kya aapako isaki soochna he
 The dock media wrote that the money was recovered
 kya wo kaagaj bhi baraamad hua, kya un logon ke naam bhi baraamad ho gaye jinke saath milakar ye khel khelaa gaya he
 Raids have been conducted in 20 locations in six cities of India
 iskar vibhaag ne neerav modi kii company ke 21 khate sil kar die hai
 Nirav Modi's passport has been canceled
 hangaamaa hua tab radd hua
 The question was not answered as to how he escaped with his family on 1 January
 kya 1 janvari tak jaanch agency ko bilkul pataa nahin tha ki neerav modi ke yahaan chaape maarane kii taiyaari he
 On page 31 of the FIR dated January 31, it is clearly written and these are the words of the FIR which states that we request you to issue a look out notice against the names given above so that it does not leave the country
 The law could not do its work
 tab 30 janvari ko hi passport kyon nahin radd hua
 After so many days of relaxation, what will be done by Nirav Modi, how the documents will have disappeared, all this will never be known
 jab 2ji ghotaale main sab bari ho gaye, jaj saini ne kaha ki ve subah se shaam tak intazaar karte rah gaye magar sibiai saboot nahin pesh kar saki
 The case of agustawestland helicopter will be remembered
 italy kii adaalat main sibiai rishwatakhori ke saboot pesh nahin kar saki
 The accused escaped from the court there and no one discussed it here
 ye he hamaari agenciyon kaa ricard

 In 2017, lous amounting to $ 5
9 million and over $ 6 million were released
 14
 2
 2017 ko 58 lakh dollar se adhik kii rakam ke do aloyu jari hue
 While it is being said that it started from 2011, it should also be said that it continued till 2017, but tried to run till January 16, 2018, but Bhanda exploded
 indian express ne likhaa he ki 2011 se 2017 ke bich dedh sau letters aaf anderteking jari hui he
 The question may be important under whose rule the scam began, is it not important to whom that share of that money went
 inke koun koun kareebi hai
 The Indian Express has written that 17 banks are in the grip of this scam
 11,300 karod ke alaava 3000 karod kaa ghotaalaa hua he
 Nirav Modi is being discussed more, but the big player of this game is also Mehul Choksi
 vahi jiskaa naam ravishankar prasad thik se nahin le paa rahe the magar pradhanmantri thik se le rahe the
 The Prime Minister is addressing our Mehul Bhai, he is the same Mehul Bhai who is a partner of Nirav Modi
 in donon ke khilaaf mumbai police kamishnar se lekar banguluru police kamishnar se lekar vitt mantralay kii sabhi agenciyon ke paas kai baar shikaayat bheji ja chuki thi
 This complaint was being made since 2013
 phir bhi yah shaks 2015 main pradhanmantri ke sarkari kaarykram main unheen ke saamne maujuud he
 Do you think anything will ever happen
 paanch logon ne agar jaan jokhim main daalkar is maamle kii shikaayat na kii hoti to aaj is ghotaale kaa itihaas aasaani se dabaa diya jaataa
 These five people were those who were writing to every agency, listening to threats, complaining about life at stake
 agar tab sun liya gaya hota to punjab neshnal bank ko 11,300 karod kaa nuksaan na uthaanaa padataa
 Shikhar Jain, Vaibhav Khurania
 hari prasad, digvijay singh jadeja or santosh shrivastav
 These people wrote a lot of letters but despair came from everywhere
 baad main khud bhi hataash hone lage ki ab kuch nahin hoga
 Had Punjab National Bank not caught on January 16, it would not have been known that some people are fighting the battle by resigning from the Gitanjali Company
 is maamle main pehla patr 4 may 2015 ko dilli sthit SIFO yani sirius frod invastigeshan argenishen ko likhaa gaya
 On 6 May, the Mumbai Police Commissioner and all the Joint Police Commissioners were written
 isaki copy vitt mantralay, corporate mantralay, pravartan nideshaalay (idi), sibiai or aarthik aparaadh shakha dilli ko bhi bheji gai
 a copy of the complaint was sent to the Prime Minister's Office for the first time on 26 July 2016
 piemo ne turant hi is copy ko register of company ko patr bhej diya
 The Registrar of Companies comes under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs
 29 july 2016 ko in logon ne register of company ko phir patr likhaa
 Two months later, the Registrar of Companies replies that the matter has been closed
 bina kisi shikayatakarta se baat kiye register of company ne maamle ko kaise band kar diya
 Had the investigation been done honestly, Punjab National Bank would not have faced such a big scam
 ab aate hai congress banaam bijepi par
 Keep in mind one thing in the allegations of both
 sawaal or jawaab is maamle se sambandhit hai yaa nahin yaa phir daayen baayen aage peeche duusare tisare kisse bhi lapet liye gaye hai
 Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala asked five more questions and said that the scam has not been worth 11,300 crore but 21,306 crore
 sarkaar kii taraf se pehle din ravishankar prasad aae the, aaj maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jaavdekar sahab aae
 He surrounded the Congress citing the statement of Allahabad Bank Director Dinesh Dubey
 dinesh doobe ne kaha he ki 2013 main un par dabaav daalaa gaya neerav modi ko karj dene ke liye to istipha de diya
 Said that Rahul Gandhi goes to Nirav Modi's exhibition
 uske baad elahabaad bank se neerav modi ko lone mil jaataa he
 This scam has been going on since the time of UPA 
 kab shuru hua yah mahatvapurn he to yah bhi mahatvapurn hona chahie ki kab tak chalata rahaa
 How did Nirav Modi finally get eight fake letter of undertaking in February 2017? pradarshnee main rahul kaa janaa mahatvapurn he to neerav modi kaa pradhanmantri modi ke saath tasviir khinchaana bhi mahatvapurn hona chahie
 In this way, you prove the theory of Is equal to two in this game of Congress vs BJP
 agar congress baraabar bijepi sabit ho gaya to iskaa matlab ghotaalaa hua hi nahin tha
 The theory of Is equal to two in political science is my discovery, which i am thinking of getting a patent from the Jaypee University of Chhapra where students are unable to do a three-year BA even in six years
 vaise jhaavdekar ko yah bhi bataanaa chahie kaa endie kii sarkaar aane, unki sarkaar ke mantralayon se shikaayat karne ke baad bhi yah ghotaalaa kyon chalata rahaa, kyon register of company ne shikaayat karne waalon ko jawaab diya ki aapke maamalon ko band kiya jaataa he
 The comments prakaash jhaavdekar ne ek baat kahi
 Clean Bank Mission
 yah mishan kya he
 Under this mission on October 3, within one day, the broker institutions, banks and companies had to tell how much loan they had left
 kya aap jaanate hai ki us svachh bank mishan kaa kya hua? kya sabane ghoshnaa kii yaa phir is mishan ko bich main hi roak diya gaya kyonki isse sabakaa hisaab kitaab baahar aa jaataa or pole khul jaataa
 Lata Venkatesh has an article on Moneycontrol
com on 13 September 2017
 lata ji sienbisi kii editor ankar hai or banking sector kii export maani jaati hai
 He wrote that this caused panic among banks and companies but this step is revolutionary in itself
 kya 3 aktabur 2017 ko ek din ke bheetar sabhi companiyon or bainkon ne apni dendaree yani bakaae kii ghoshnaa kii
 According to our information, this cleanliness mission of banks suddenly disappeared
 ab daawa to nahin kar sakate kyonki ham is kshetra ke export nahin hai isliye aap bhi kisi bank adhikari se puch len
 Not only is everything known from the newspaper, some relatives also tell
 16 farvari ko punjab neshnal bank kaa share teen pratishat or gira
 After this scam, Punjab National Bank's stock has gone down in 52 weeks
 8 hazaar karod se zyaada iske shairdharakon ko nuksaan ho chukaa he
 Agricultural economist Devendra Sharma has calculated that if the loan of up to one and a half lakhs is waived, then from this 11000 crores to 30 lakh farmers will become debt free
 dedh lakh kaa karza he ram raaj par, jaan dene lakhanu aa gaye, 11000 karod kaa chuunaa lagaakar neerav modi chale gaye neuyark, usase pehle gaye sweetzaraland jiske bare main kaha jaataa he ki kaala dhan kaa ghar he, vahiin ke daavos main jaataa he or pradhanmantri ke saath photo khinchaa letaa he
 We talked to the farmers what they think about this miracle of Nirav Modi
 15 farvari ke press conference main ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki neerav modi pradhanmantri ke saath nahin gaye the, balki kanfideration of indian industry (siaiai) ke log lekar gaye
 But when you google, you will get a news of 2016
 financial express kii is khabar ke mutabik vitt mantri arun jetali us saal 100 udyogpatiyon ko lekar daavos gaye the
 Many names are printed, one name is also of Nirav Modi
 13 janvari 2016 ko yah khabar samachar agency pitiai se jari hui he jise kai akhabaaron ne chapa he
 On 16 February 2018 i
e
 today's Times of India, c Unnikrishnan wrote the news that in the year of 2016, Nirav Modi had to pay a penalty of 48 crores because in December 2014 he was smuggling by showing diamonds of 1000 crores
 diarectorot of revenue intelligence, diarai main do saal cese chalaa, phir 48 karod kaa jurmaana bharna padaa
 The question is whether the DRI investigated further after such a big theft or confined itself only to this case
 smagaling kaa maamla chalata rahaa phir bhi kaise yah shaks vitt mantri ke saath 2016 main daavos gaya
 CBI was going to start an investigation, then it is present in the photo frame with Nirav Modi, Prime Minister Modi
 shaayad isiilie ravishankar prasad kah rahe the ki photo kii raajnneeti na ho, taaki logon ko pataa na chale
 He should have told all this when he had come for the press conference
 pradhanmantri ke saath bhale na gaye hon magar 1000 karod kaa maal chori se baahar bhejne vaala vitt mantri ke saath daavos jaae kya yah thik he
 Nirav Modi is in a hotel in New York
 dilli main unki dukaan par chapa padaa he
 But his shop is in many countries of the world
 kya vahaan bhi chaape pade hai
 Have you heard any such news? The case is about making money from the companies in the name of diamond business
 sabit kuch nahin hoga isi kaa afsos he kyonki is khabar ko khatm karne ke liye zarur koi bada event aa rahaa hoga
 No ruckus or any ruckus
 hamaari sahyogi namrata baraar neuyark main je dablyoo merriott ke 36wein floor par jaakar koshish karti raheen ki neerav modi baat kar len, apana paksh rakh den, safal nahin raheen
 The dock media immediately started writing news that 5000 crores were recovered
 isi game ko aapako samajhnaa he
 Consignment is seized, it takes several months to years to fix the price
 aap kisi bhi iskar adhikari se puch sakate hai
 But it is also known that there are also gems experts in the team of raids, who are also telling the price along with them
 jo bhi he, chapa to bharat kii dukaanon par padaa he lekin neerav modi jis hotel main he usee ke paas neuyark main unka ek or store he, duniya ke kai deshon main dukaan he, kya vahaan bhi chaape pad rahe hai
 Are you aware of this godi media ne likh diya ki paisa baraamad ho gaya
 Has that paper also been recovered, have the names of those people with whom this game has been played together be recovered
 bharat ke chah shaharon main 20 thikaanon par chaape pade hai
 The Income Tax Department has sealed 21 accounts of Nirav Modi's company
 neerav modi kaa passport radd ho gaya he
 It was canceled when there was an uproar
 is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin mila ki 1 janvari ko kaise apane parivaar ke saath faraar hua
 By January 1, the investigating agency did not know at all that Nirav Modi was preparing to conduct a raid here
 31 janvari kii exiaar ke pej number aath par saaf saaf likhaa he or ye exiaar ke hi shabd hai jisamen kaha gaya he ki ham aapse aagrah karte hai ki upar die gaye naamon ke khilaaf luk out notice jari kiya jaae taaki wo desh chhod kar ja nahin sake or kanoon apana kaam nahin kar paae
 Then why the passport was not canceled on 30 January
 itane dinon kii chhot ke baad neerav modi ne kya-kya herapheri kii, kis tarah se dastavej gaayab kar liye honge yah sab ab kabhi pataa nahin chalegaa
 When everyone was acquitted in the 2G scam, Judge Saini said that he kept waiting from morning till evening but the CBI could not produce evidence
 agusta westland helicopter kaa maamla yaad hoga
 The CBI could not produce evidence of bribery in an Italian court
 vahaan kii adaalat se aaropee chhot gaye or yahaan kisi ne charchaa nahin kii
 This is the record of our agencies
 exiaar main saat logon ke naam hai
 Nirav Modi, Amee Nirav Modi, Nishaal Modi, Mehul Chinubhai Chowkasi, Gokulnath Shetty, Manoj Hanumant Kharat, Deputy Manager PNB and other unknown people, Bank Officer, PNB
 aarope he ki farji tareeke se letters of anderteking jari kii gai jiske partner neerav modi, shri nishaal modi, shri ami neerav modi or shri mehul chinubhai chaukasee hai
 It is said to start from 2011 but it is written in the FIR that 9

 In 2017, lous amounting to $ 44 million and $ 4
3 million were issued

 2017 ko 59 lakh dollar or 60 lakh dollar se zyaada kii rakam kii aloyu jari hui

 In 2017, two lous worth more than $ 5
8 million were issued
 jab yah bataa hi rahe hai ki 2011 se shuru hua to yah bhi bataanaa chahie ki 2017 tak chalata rahaa balki 16 janvari 2018 tak chalaane kii koshish hui magar bhanda foot gaya
 The Indian Express has written that between 2011 and 2017, 150 letters of undertaking have been released
 yah sawaal mahatvapurn ho saktaa he ki ghotaalaa kiske raaj main shuru hua, kya yah mahatvapurn nahin he ki us paise kaa hissaa kis kis ke paas gaya
 Who are close to them? indian express ne likhaa he ki 17 bank is ghotaale kii chapet main hai
 Apart from 11,300 crores, 3000 crores have been scammed
 charchaa neerav modi kii zyaada ho rahi he magar is khel kaa bada khilaadi mehul chaukasee bhi he
 The one whose name Ravi Shankar Prasad was not able to take properly but the Prime Minister was taking it properly
 pradhanmantri jis hamaare mehul bhai ko sambodhit kar rahe hai ye vahi mehul bhai hai jo neerav modi ke partner hai
 Complaints had been sent against these two from Mumbai Police Commissioner to Bangalore Police Commissioner to all agencies of Finance Ministry several times
 yah shikaayat 2013 se kii ja rahi thi
 Yet this man is present in front of him in the Prime Minister's official program in 2015
 aapako lagata he ki kabhi kuch hoga
 If five people had not complained about the matter without risking their lives, then the history of this scam would have been easily suppressed
 ye paanch log wo hai jo har agency ko likh rahe the, dhamkiyaan sun rahe the, jindagi daanv par lagaakar shikaayat kar rahe the
 Had it been heard then, Punjab National Bank would not have lost Rs 11,300 crore
 shikhar jain, vaibhav khurania
 Hari Prasad, Digvijay Singh Jadeja and Santosh Srivastava
 in logon ne khub patr likhe magar har jagah se niraashaa haath lagi
 Later, he himself started getting frustrated that nothing will happen now
 punjab neshnal bank ne 16 janvari ko nahin pakadaa hota to yah pataa hi nahin chalata ki kuch log gitanjali company se istipha dekar isaki ladaai lard rahe hai
 The first letter in this case was written on 4 May 2015 to Delhi-based SIFO i
e
 Serious Fraud Investigation Organization
 6 may ko mumbai police kamishnar or saare joint police kamishnar ko likhaa gaya
 The copy was also sent to the Ministry of Finance, Corporate Ministry, Enforcement Directorate (ED), CBI and Economic Offenses Wing Delhi
 26 july 2016 ko pehali baar pradhanmantri karyaalay ko shikaayat kii copy bheji gai
 The PMO immediately sent this copy to the Registrar of Companies
 register of company korporate maamle ke mantralay ke tahat aata he
 On 29 July 2016, these people again wrote to the Registrar of Companies
 do maheene baad register of company kaa jawaab aata he ki maamla band ho gaya he
 How the Registrar of Companies closed the case without talking to the complainant
 agar eemaandaaree se jaanch hui hoti to punjab neshnal bank ko itane bade ghotaale kaa saamana nahin karnaa padataa
 Now come on Congress vs BJP
 donon ke aarope pratyarope main ek baat kaa dhyaan rakhie
 The questions and answers are related to this matter or not or whether other third stories have been wrapped back and forth to the right
 congress ke pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne paanch sawaal or puche or kaha ki yah ghotaalaa 11300 karod kaa nahin balki 21,306 karod kaa ho gaya he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad came from the government on the first day, today HRD minister Prakash Javadekar saheb came
 unhone elahabaad bank ke nideshak dinesh doobe ke bayaan ke hawaale se congress ko gheraa
 Dinesh Dubey has said that Nirav who was pressurized in 2013, resigned to give loan to Modi
 kaha ki rahul gandhi neerav modi kii pradarshnee main jate hai
 After that, Nirav Modi gets a loan from Allahabad Bank
 yah ghotaalaa upie ke samay se chal rahaa he
 When it started it is important, so it should also be important how long it lasted
 aakhir farvari 2017 main aath jaali letters of anderteking kaise mil gaya neerav modi ko
 It is important for Rahul to go to the exhibition, then it should also be important for Nirav Modi to be photographed with Prime Minister Modi
 is tarah aap congress banaam bijepi ke is khel main iz ikval tu kii theory ko sabit kar dete hai
 If the Congress proved to be an equal BJP, it did not mean a scam
 polytical science main ij ikval tu kii theory meri khoj he jise chhapra ke jepi uniwarsity se patent karaane kii soch rahaa hum jahaan chaatr teen saal kaa bie chah saal main bhi nahin kar pate hai
 By the way, Jawadekar should also explain why this scam continued even after the NDA government came and complained to his government's ministries, why the Registrar of Companies responded to the complainants that your cases are closed
 tippaniyan Prakash Jhavadekar said one thing
 svachh bank mishan kii
 What is this mission 3 aktubar ko is mishan ke tahat ek din ke bheetar brokar sansthaaon, bank or companiyon ko bataanaa tha ki unke paas kitna lone baaki he
 Do you know what happened to that clean bank mission? Did everyone announce or was this mission stopped in the middle because it would have brought out the book and opened the pole for everyone
 13 sitambar 2017 ko manicontrol daat kaam par lata venkatesh kaa is par lekh he
 Lata ji is the editor anchor of CNBC and is considered an expert in the banking sector

 Did all companies and banks declare their dues, i

, on 3 October 2017, within a day
 hamaari jaankaree ke anusaar bainkon kaa yah swatchta mishan achaanak gaayab ho gaya
 Can't claim now because we are not experts in this field, so you should also ask any bank officer
 sab akhbaar se hi nahin pataa kiya jaataa he kuch rishtedaar bhi bataa dete hai
 On February 16, Punjab National Bank's stock fell three percent
 is ghotaale ke baad punjab neshnal bank kaa share 52 saptaah main sabase neeche chalaa gaya he
 Its shareholders have lost more than 8000 crores

 Nothing will prove to be regretted because there must be a big event to end this news

 Our colleague Namrata Brar went on the 36th floor of JW Marriott in New York and tried to get Nirav Modi to talk, put forward his case and not succeed
 godi media ne turant khabar likhnaa shuru kar diya ki 5000 karod baraamad ho gaye

 The law could not do its work

 Shikhar Jain, Vaibhav Khurania

 These people wrote a lot of letters but despair came from everywhere
 baad main khud bhi hataash hone lage ki ab kuch nahin hoga
 Had Punjab National Bank not caught on January 16, it would not have been known that some people are fighting the battle by resigning from the Gitanjali Company

 piemo ne turant hi is copy ko register of company ko patr bhej diya
 The Registrar of Companies comes under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs
 29 july 2016 ko in logon ne register of company ko phir patr likhaa
 Two months later, the Registrar of Companies replies that the matter has been closed

 How did Nirav Modi finally get eight fake letter of undertaking in February 2017? pradarshnee main rahul kaa janaa mahatvapurn he to neerav modi kaa pradhanmantri modi ke saath tasviir khinchaana bhi mahatvapurn hona chahie
 In this way, you prove the theory of Is equal to two in this game of Congress vs BJP
 agar congress baraabar bijepi sabit ho gaya to iskaa matlab ghotaalaa hua hi nahin tha
 The theory of Is equal to two in political science is my discovery, which i am thinking of getting a patent from the Jaypee University of Chhapra where students are unable to do a three-year BA even in six years
 vaise jhaavdekar ko yah bhi bataanaa chahie kaa endie kii sarkaar aane, unki sarkaar ke mantralayon se shikaayat karne ke baad bhi yah ghotaalaa kyon chalata rahaa, kyon register of company ne shikaayat karne waalon ko jawaab diya ki aapke maamalon ko band kiya jaataa he

 Its shareholders have lost more than 8000 crores
 bina kisi shikayatakarta se baat kiye register of company ne maamle ko kaise band kar diya
 Had the investigation been done honestly, Punjab National Bank would not have faced such a big scam
 ab aate hai congress banaam bijepi par
 Keep in mind one thing in the allegations of both
 sawaal or jawaab is maamle se sambandhit hai yaa nahin yaa phir daayen baayen aage peeche duusare tisare kisse bhi lapet liye gaye hai
 Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala asked five more questions and said that the scam has not been worth 11,300 crore but 21,306 crore
 sarkaar kii taraf se pehle din ravishankar prasad aae the, aaj maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jaavdekar sahab aae
 He surrounded the Congress citing the statement of Allahabad Bank Director Dinesh Dubey
 dinesh doobe ne kaha he ki 2013 main un par dabaav daalaa gaya neerav modi ko karj dene ke liye to istipha de diya
 Said that Rahul Gandhi goes to Nirav Modi's exhibition
 uske baad elahabaad bank se neerav modi ko lone mil jaataa he
 This scam has been going on since the time of UPA
 kab shuru hua yah mahatvapurn he to yah bhi mahatvapurn hona chahie ki kab tak chalata rahaa
 How did Nirav Modi finally get eight fake letter of undertaking in February 2017? pradarshnee main rahul kaa janaa mahatvapurn he to neerav modi kaa pradhanmantri modi ke saath tasviir khinchaana bhi mahatvapurn hona chahie
 In this way, you prove the theory of Is equal to two in this game of Congress vs BJP
 agar congress baraabar bijepi sabit ho gaya to iskaa matlab ghotaalaa hua hi nahin tha
 The theory of Is equal to two in political science is my discovery, which i am thinking of getting a patent from the Jaypee University of Chhapra where students are unable to do a three-year BA even in six years
 vaise jhaavdekar ko yah bhi bataanaa chahie kaa endie kii sarkaar aane, unki sarkaar ke mantralayon se shikaayat karne ke baad bhi yah ghotaalaa kyon chalata rahaa, kyon register of company ne shikaayat karne waalon ko jawaab diya ki aapke maamalon ko band kiya jaataa he
 The comments prakaash jhaavdekar ne ek baat kahi

 Ravi Shankar Prasad came from the government on the first day, today HRD minister Prakash Javadekar saheb came
 unhone elahabaad bank ke nideshak dinesh doobe ke bayaan ke hawaale se congress ko gheraa
 Dinesh Dubey has said that Nirav who was pressurized in 2013, resigned to give loan to Modi
 kaha ki rahul gandhi neerav modi kii pradarshnee main jate hai
 After that, Nirav Modi gets a loan from Allahabad Bank
 yah ghotaalaa upie ke samay se chal rahaa he
 When it started it is important, so it should also be important how long it lasted
 aakhir farvari 2017 main aath jaali letters of anderteking kaise mil gaya neerav modi ko
 It is important for Rahul to go to the exhibition, then it should also be important for Nirav Modi to be photographed with Prime Minister Modi
 is tarah aap congress banaam bijepi ke is khel main iz ikval tu kii theory ko sabit kar dete hai
 If the Congress proved to be an equal BJP, it did not mean a scam

 By the way, Jawadekar should also explain why this scam continued even after the NDA government came and complained to his government's ministries, why the Registrar of Companies responded to the complainants that your cases are closed

 The 2014 general election is over
 
 There is only one discussion everywhere, will the BJP be able to get a majority on its own or will it form the government through the NDA
 congress kya do anko main simat kar rah jaaegi or upie kaa kunba badi mushkil se sau kaa akda paar kar paaegaa, lekin in sabake bich ek baat par na to media or naa hi dalon ke bich charchaa ho rahi he
 That is, more than 50 soldiers lost their lives to get this election done
 akele siarpief ke 26 jawan chunaav dyuty karte hue shahid ho gaye
 Not only this, about 35 soldiers have also been injured by this force alone
 lagata he in javaanon kaa kasoor bas itnaa rahaa ki ve desh main saaf suthere chunaav karwaanaa chaahate the
 This is the first time such a large number of soldiers have been killed during the elections
 isse pehle 2004 ke aam chunaavon ke dauraan do or 2009 main chah jawan kii maut hui thi
 Despite this, the courage of the soldiers did not diminish
 is baar 127 iidi, 52 hathiyaar, 452 gola barud or 807 kilo visphotak jabt kiye gaye
 Moreover, there were more than 52 encounters
 shaayad hi ye baat logon ko pataa ho ki chunaav ke din ho yaa phir uski taiyaariyon ko lekar, ye jawan subah se lekar shaam tak 40 se 50 kilometre paidal chale hai
 Unaware of the fact that it was impossible to get elections from forest to mountain without their help, the death of them is following them
 kai dfa to aisa bhi hua ki jawan ghayal hokar sadak par padaa hua he, lekin use aspataal le jane ke liye helicopter ghanton baad pahunchaa
 When we talked to the top officials about this, it came to know that they could not immediately send helicopters to help the soldiers even if they wanted to
 kyonki isse pehle unhen puure ilaake kii gheraabandi kerani padati taaki naksali fire na kar den
 Apart from this, there is a delay in paperwork as well, anyway, these soldiers are not Narendra Modi or Rahul Gandhi, for whom one or several helicopters are available round the clock
 aaj in javaanon kii shikaayat he, chunaav main koi bhi jite, lekin unki bahaduree or qurbaani ko naa bhoolen
 Because nothing can be more sacrificed than the sacrifice they have given to preserve democracy

 In fact, Neha had canceled the license of Balwinder's shop as a drug inspector in the year 2007
 iske baad usne neha se dushmani paal lee
 After the murder of Neha, people expressed their anger on social media
 balvinder ne jis vakt hamalaa kiya, karyaalay main ek hi security guard tainaat tha
 But he could not see her

 She was talking on the phone to her niece when Shourie was attacked
 balvinder ne neha ko teen goliyaan maarin
 One on his chest, the other on his face and the third on his shoulder

 Will the government, which came to power earlier this year, take a bold decision to end subsidies on diesel? The Indian car market has been leaning in favor of diesel cars over the last few years
 kya kaaron ke bare main aapaki pasand par koi asar padane vaala he?pichley kai varshon se dijal ingine vaali car khareednaa hoshiyaari bharaa faisla rahaa he
 Not only this, companies like Honda Cars India Limited have made huge profits by including diesel cars in their fleet
 entry level kii gadipoon ko chhodkar adhiktar shreniyon main yah dikhaa ki agar kisi model kaa dijal sanskaran bhi he to vah kareeb 80 fisadi bikri par kabiz rahaa
 Such unusual circumstances arose in the market due to the government controlling the price of diesel
 lekin dijal par sarkari sabsidi khatm hone ke kaaran bahut jaldi sab badal jane vaala he
 About two years ago, the price difference between petrol and diesel was Rs 30 per liter
 tha
 Today this difference is only 10 rupees
 he, jabaki hakeekat yah he ki kachche tel ko shodhit karke dijal taiyaar karnaa petrol ke mukaable kahin adhik kharchila he
 If prices of petrol and diesel come closer to each other in the coming months, it should not be surprising
 agar viksit deshon ke anubhavon kii baat karen to sambhav he ki aage chalakar dijal kii tulana main petrol kii keemat kam ho jaae
 Even in such a situation, is it wise to buy a diesel car? It is true that diesel engines naturally give more mileage than petrol engines, but it should also be remembered that diesel engines cost more
 yahi nahin, iskaa rakrakhaav bhi adhik kharchila he
 The early models of diesel cars also get a different driving pleasure due to the higher torque, while the same is found in the top end models of petrol
 phir bhi, kam-se-kam apane desh main, jeet usee kii hogi jo kam kharchila ho
 To understand my point better, i will give examples of three cars of different segments
 foxwagon polo or honda mobileo main saamaanya petrol ingine he jabaki scoda octavia main diarect injection terbo chajrd petrol ingine he
 These petrol engines cost as much as diesel engines and they enjoy both petrol and diesel engines during driving
 inamen output zyada hota he, lihaaja badi kaaron main bhi kam kshamta ke ingine kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Based on the current oil prices, if someone travels a distance of at least 3,000 km every month, then he can choose from diesel and petrol polo
 kareeb 2,000 kimi prati maah car chalaane waalon ke liye dijal mobileo or kareeb 5,000 kimi prati maah chalaane waalon ke liye petrol kii bajaae dijal octavia behatar hoga
 If the prices of both fuels become the same, which is likely to be seen next year, the expected mileage will be more in terms of recovering the entire money
 polo ke liye kareeb 4,500 kimi, mobilo ke liye 2,500 kimi or octavia dijal ke liye 7,000 kimi se bhi adhik
 These figures are derived from the fuel economy figures announced by the manufacturers in view of legal requirements
 kaaron ke istemaal ke taur-tareekon se aankadon main antar dikh saktaa he

 com / hrp6ik00zv Ishant Sharma took a career-best performance (six wickets for 51 runs) taking advantage of the pace conditions of fast bowling, making India in a good position to contain New Zealand for just 192 runs in the first innings on the opening day of the second and final cricket test
 
 ishanth ne captain mahendra singh dhoni ke basin rigerv kii hariyaali pich par toss jitkar gendbaaji karne ke faisle ko sahi tehraaya or apni line evam length se mejabaan team ke ballebaajon ko ghutane techne par majaboor kar diya
 Mohammed Shami (four wickets for 70 runs) also contributed well to India's dominating performance on the first day, taking the wickets of Kane Williamson (47) and debutant James Neesham (33) on important occasions
 bhartiya salaami ballebaaj shikhar dhawan ne aakraamak naabad ardhashtakeey pari kheli, jisase bharat ne stump tak do wicket khokar 100 ran bana liye, team ab bhi 92 ran se pichad rahi he
 India lost the wickets of openers Murali Vijay (2) and Cheteshwar Pujara (19) cheaply, after which Dhawan (71 not out) and night guard Ishant are playing for three runs
 ishanth ne pehle test ke shandaar pradarshan ko jari rakhte hue shrunkhlaa main duusari baar paanch wicket hasil kiye or apane 55wein test main kul paanchavin baar yah karnama kiya
 Ishant took three wickets in the first four overs of his morning spell, laying the foundation for India's successful day
 shrunkhlaa main 1-0 se aage chal rahi newjiland kii team pehle test kii duusari pari main bhi is tarah se ladkadaa gai thi, yani pichhali do pariyon main bhartiya gendbaajon ne kiwi ballebaajon ko khub chatakaaya he
 However, India's performance during the entire tour has been very poor
 haalanki bhartiya team ke captain mahendra singh dhoni ne is siries main sabhi toss jite hai, lekin ek bhi match nahin jeeta he

 Has police or adhikarik sutron ne yah jaankaree di
 According to Additional Director General of Police Navdeep Singh Law and Order, Rajesh and Banwari Lal Meena climbed on the water tank after the arrest of the accused of murder of Dakha Devi, but not after the scheduled time, after spraying petrol on themselves, they opened fire Jumped off rajesh ne maukey par hi dam tod diya

 uttar pradesh main chunaav ho rahaa he puure desh kii najar upi par tiki hai
 But the most surprising thing is that the central leadership of the BJP did not consider even a single leader of the Bihar BJP to be included in the list of star campaigners of the UP elections
 bijepi ke kendriya netritv ne jo list jari kii he usamen bihar bijepi kaa ek bhi netaa shaamil nahin he
 The name of Lok Janshakti Party National President and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan is definitely included in that list, while the national president of Hindustan Awam Morcha and former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi are also not in that list
 padosi rajya uttar pradesh main chunaav ho rahaa he lekin bihar ke bijepi netaa haath par haath dhare baithe hai
 Nobody is asking them
 bijepi ke kendriya netritv ne jo 40 star prachaarkon kii suchi banaai he usamen bihar bijepi kaa ek bhi netaa nahin he jabaki bihar or uttar pradesh kii raajnneeti bahut alag nahin he
 Especially in areas adjacent to Bihar, Tobihar BJP leaders have a significant influence but the central leadership did not give special importance to their influence
 chunaav prachaar ke liye star prachaarkon ki list main jagah naa milane se bihar bijepi ke netaa apane aap ko apamaanit to mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Sushil Kumar Modi, the biggest face of Bihar BJP and contender for the post of Chief Minister of Bihar in the last election, smiles on this question but there is pain in that too
 haalanki unhone baat ko sambhalate hue kaha ki prachaar karne ke liye star prachaarak kii suchi main rahanaa jaruri nahin he
 All the leaders will go to campaign in the border areas adjoining Bihar
 upi chunaav se baahar bihar!upi main bijepi ke star prachaarkon main bihar ke ramvilas paswan ko hi jagah di gai he
 From this list, it became clear what is the status of Bihar BJP leaders in front of the central leadership of the BJP
 kabhi bijepi ke saath rahe jediu is sawaal par bijepi kaa majaak udaana nahin bhuuli
 In Bihar, the ruling JDU disassociated itself from contesting the UP elections at the last moment
 party pravaktaa niraj kumaar ne bihar bijepi ke netaaon par waar karte hue kaha ki bijepi ke kendriya netritv ne bihar bijepi netaaon ke diene par sawaal khadaa kar diya he
 However, this time the leaders of Bihar will have no presence in Uttar Pradesh elections
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii party jediu vahaan chunaav nahin lard rahi he wo prachaar ke liye bhi nahin jaayenge
 Lalu Yadav's party RJD is not contesting the election, but National President Lalu Prasad Yadav will go for election campaigning for Samajwadi Party
 udhar kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan bhi star prachaarak kii suchi main shaamil hone ke baavjood khush nahin he kyonki un se tikat ke bare main koi raay tak nahin lee gai

 vishnu ji ne kaha ki main aapse jo kahuun vah aap maanengi to aap mere saath chal sakati hai
 Lakshmiji agreed to him and came to earth with Lord Vishnu
 kuch der baad ek jagah par pahunch kar bhagwaan vishnu ne lakshmi se kaha ki jab tak main na aauun tum yahaan tehro
 i am going towards south direction, do not come there
 vishnuji ke jane par lakshmike man main kautuhal jaagaa ki aakhir dakshin disha main aisa kya rahasy he, jo mujhe manaa kiya gaya he or bhagwaan swayan chale gaye
 Laxmi ji could not keep up and as God moved forward, Laxmi also followed
 kuch hi aage jane par unhen sarson kaa ek khet dikhaai diya jisamen khub phool lage the
 Seeing the beauty of mustard, she was enchanted and went ahead after plucking flowers and doing her makeup
 aage jane par ek ganne ke khet se lakshmi ganne todakar ras chusane lageen
 At the same time Vishnu came and seeing Laxmiji was angry and cursed him that i had forbidden you to come here, but you did not listen and committed the crime of stealing the farmer
 ab tum is aparaadh ke jurm main is kisaan kii 12 varsh tak seva karo
 Saying this, God left them and went to Kshirsagar
 lakshmi us garib kisaan ke ghar rahane lageen
 One day Lakshmiji told the wife of that farmer that after bathing you first worship this devilakshmi made by me, then cook the kitchen, then you will get what you ask for
 kisaan kii patni ne aisa hi kiya
 Due to the effects of worship and the blessings of Lakshmi, the farmer's house was filled with food, money, gems, gold etc
 from the second day itself
 lakshmi ne kisaan ko dhan-dhaany se purna kar diya
 The farmer's 12 years were blissfully cut
 phir 12 varsh ke baad lakshmi jane ke liye taiyaar huin
 When Vishnu came to take Laxmiji, the farmer refused to send him
 tab bhagwaan ne kisaan se kaha ki inhen koun jane detaa he, yah to chanchala hai, kahin nahin thaharatin
 Could not stop them very big
 inako meraa shaap tha isliye 12 varsh se tumhaari seva kar rahi thim
 Your 12 years of service have been completed
 kisaan hathpurvak bolaa ki, nahin ab main lakshmi ko nahin jane duungaa
 Then Laxmiji said, o farmer, if you want to stop me, then do what i say
 kal teras he
 You must clean the house tomorrow by leaping
 raatri main ghi kadeepak jalakarrakhana or siankal meraa pujan karnaa or ek tambe ke kalash main rupye bharkar mere liye rakhana, main us kalash main nivas karuungi
 But i will not show you at the time of worship
 is ek din kii puja se varsh bhar main tumhaare ghar se nahin jaaoongi
 Having said this she spread in ten directions with the light of lamps
 agle din kisaan ne lakshmi ke kathanusaar pujan kiya
 His house was full of money
 isi vajah se har varsh teras ke din lakshmi kii puja hone lagi

 It was such a havoc at Kudrat Shah's house in Bundelkhand, which has been broken by drought, which the governments of democratic India do not have

 But before his words, written in Shanta Ras and heard on the lines of Alha, try to gauge the depth of the water crisis in Bundelkhand and other drought-hit districts of Madhya Pradesh
 jaise, lalitpur jile ke 70 tiemasi kshamta vaale vishaal rajghat baandh main sirf 6 tiemasi pani bachaa he
 The Matatila dam has only two TMC water

 Banda's environmental watchdog Ashish Sagar asks, "after all, in April 2015, when the Meteorological Department had forecast that the monsoon is going to be raging for the second time in a row, why has there been no concrete arrangement in a year since then?" Despite the Supreme Court summoning the response to the drought situation in ten states four months ago, despite this, governments are doing the exercise to deal with the drought, when the real time to deal with it is out of hand
 vaise, sarkarein jo upaay kar rahi hai, unki baangi dekhie
 The night after Razia Khatoon's house burnt the next day on April 10, in Delhi, on the instructions of the Prime Minister, a high level meeting was held in the Prime Minister's Office on the situation in Bundelkhand, Vidarbha and Marathwada

 This announcement sounds very effective, but it has many layers
 upi sarkaar is ghoshnaa ko thik vaisaa nahin maanati jaisaa ise centre sarkaar bataa rahi he
 On the question of how long this money will reach the farmers' account, the Chief Minister's Office in reply to India Today explained the language of the figures, "2,057 to the Government of India for immediate solution to the problem of crop damage and drought

 "that means, the money that was beaten for sending the money to the farmers' account in a week, how far the money actually reached, even after four days, the DM does not know, so what will the farmer know about it?" Despite this, farmer leader of Bundelkhand Shivnarine Parihar says, "why are you worried for a week, if the money comes even after a year, the farmer will be satisfied with this" immediate relief "

 So this is the condition that the government has taken an initiative on crop crisis which is clearly visible since January
 ab waapas lautate hai pine ke pani ke vartmaan sankat kii taraf, jiske hal ke liye shahar or gaanv chatak hue ja rahe hai

 However, they could not tell what deficiencies were left in the package and who has been blamed for it? In the absence of all these facts, how will the Modi government make the Manmohan government work better in Bundelkhand

 satr kaa sanchaalan rajeev dube ke saath rahul kanwal ne kiya
 According to Rajiv Talwar, no company has been shut down due to e-monetization
 riel estate regulation act apni jagah par he
 The Supreme Court is ruling for the benefit of the buyers
 talwaar ke mutabik notembdi ke baad logon ko ghar kharidne ke liye sabase badi chunauti he ki vah kaise cash ko ekatra kare
 Even today, if he has to pay large part of his payment in cash in buying a house, then he will have to see the way to collect cash
 lihaaja, real estate main abhi bhi un logon ke liye cash main kharidari karnaa sambhav he jo apane liye cash kii vyavastha karne main kaamyaab ho rahe hai
 According to Talbar, prices have fallen in real estate but according to the circle rate the prices are still above the market price
 lihaaja, real estate ko thik karne ke liye behad jaruri he ki ab cirkel rate main bhi lagbhag 25-30 fisadi kii katautee kii jaae
 Sanjay Sethi said that the decline in cash on delivery was recorded after the announcement of note ban
 lekin maujuuda samay main ek baar phir cash on delivery ke usee str par ham pahunch chuke hai
 How has Geneva changed in such a situation
 sanjay ne bataaya ki notembdi ke baad se desh main bahut kuch badla he
 But what changed from mere demonetisation, but Sanjay said that no significant change has been seen from it
 bipin preet singh ne kaha ki notebandi ke baad sabase bada phayda or badlaav yah dekhne ko mila he ki isse sarkaar ne apane sabhi vibhaagon ko digital pement ke liye khol diya he
 At the same time, cash and checks were dominated by government departments before demonetisation
 bipin ne bataaya ki notebandi se pehle desh main mahaj jinati pioes mashine istemaal hoti thi ab uski sankhya main 5 guna ijapha ho chukaa he
 It is clear that more shops in the country are ready to take digital payments
 bipin ke mutabik aaj kii taarikh main chote kaarobaari digital pement lene se manaa nahin kar rahe hai vahiin notebandi se pehle cash kii puri tarah se praathamikta di jaati thi
 Kunwar Singh- According to Kunwar, after the announcement of demonetisation, his business was completely stalled for about 2 months
 vahiin do maheene baad jab chijen thodaa-thodaa sanbhalane lagi 1 july se puure desh main jiesti lagu kar diya gaya
 According to Kunwar, immediately after the notice, there was a big payment challenge before his contractors, now he has turned to cash once the situation is normal
 kunwar ne kaha ki digital pement main sabase badi chunauti he ki vahaan 2 fisadi kaa tranjaction cat vasula jaataa he
 Therefore, no businessman or customer would want to give this cut with their money
 kunwar ke mutabik notebandi ke baad tex chori kii yadi 100 ghatnaayen thim to aaj vah ghatakar 70 par pahunch gai hai

 ye sena kaa adhikaar he or raashtra kii suraksha ke liye jaruri he
 The Chief Justice said that the matter will be considered seriously

 dilli main siyasat kii bisaat bich chuki he
 On one end is Arvind Kejriwal of Aam Aadmi Party and Kiran Bedi of BJP on the other
 donon bhrashtachar ke khilaaf anna andolan se nikle hai
 But in the midst of all this, the 'guru' Anna Hazare of both does not seem very happy with his political innings
 ajtak ke saath khaas baatcheet main anna ne jahaan bedi ke bare main kuch bhi bolne se inkaar kar diya, vahiin kaha ki donon andolan se nikle hai or koi ek siem banegaa isliye vah khush hai
 Accusing the Modi government of indifference against corruption, Anna said that he would agitate again in march-april
 anna ne kaha ki raajnneeti main aane ke baad arvind kejariwal unhen bhul gaye hai or unke bich maharashtra sadan ke alaava kabhi mulaakaat nahin hui
 Anna said that Kiran Bedi never talked to them and hence he does not want to say anything about the two
 anna ne kaha ki mukhyamantri banane ke baad arvind kejariwal ne unhen kabhi yaad nahin kiya or unhen sirf satta kii parvaah he
 Modi and Manmohan Sarkar are the same, taking a dig at the Narendra Modi government on the issue of corruption, Anna said that eight months have passed, but the government is silent on this issue
 bhoomi adhigrahan or kaledhan ke mudde par bhi sarkaar udasin he
 BJP had promised that 15 lakhs would come to every man's account, not even 15 paise
 anna ne kaha, 'congress kii sarkaar ke kaarykaal main bhrashtachar charam par tha
 That is why she did not return to power
 aaj rajyon main dupliket lokapal banaaya gaya he
 If Lokpal is formed by the will of the government, then it is of no use
 ' anna ne kaha ki bhrashtachar virdohi 5 bill atake pade hai, lekin sarkaar koi sud nahin le rahi he
 Delhi to vote thoughtfully Anna has appealed to the voters of Delhi to vote thoughtfully
 anna ne kaha, 'kis aadmi ko vot de rahen he
 First, see which party you are voting for
 ' anna ne kaha ki bedi or kejariwal donon bhrashtachar ke khilaaf andolan se nikle hai, aise main agar inamen se koi bhi siem banataa he to unhen khushi hogi
 That could not be done by calling all party meet
 jo kaam spikar dwaara congress ke 25 saansadon ko suspend karke nahin ho sakaa
 The work could not be done by a Rajya Sabha mp's Late Night Party
 use ek kol or phir conference par do or netaaon ke aane ke saath hi ho gaya
 After all, how was this possible? Let us know in detail

 It seems that China has hung steel in the beads of its naval bases spread around India as far as Myanmar in the east, Sri Lanka in the south and Pakistan in the west
 ro, raksha khufia agency or nausainik khufia nideshaalay ne sarkaar ko saavdhaan kiya ki is tainaati se bharat kii suraksha chintaaen bahut bad gai hai
 As such, China claimed that the Shang-class SSN submarine was part of the regular anti-deterrence patrol and returned to its base in Hainan Island in the South China Sea on 20 February after being in the Indian Ocean for two months, but India was followed by a more vicious motive appears
 sarkaar ke ek varisht adhikari ne india today ko bataaya, “parmaanu shakti chaalit hamalavar pandubbiyaan daseurodhi gasht main hissaa nahin letin
 “in the eyes of naval experts, this is a rehearsal for deploying a large scale fleet in the Indian Ocean
 hamalavar pandubbiyon, yupoton, tankeron or sainya jahaajon kaa yah jangi bedaa is samay nirmaanadhin do vimanavahak poton ko chaaron taraf se gher legaa
 Retired Rear Admiral Raja Menon says this is "a reconnaissance mission, a sign of full-scale deployment
" ”aag uglanajab bhi aisa hoga to isse bharat kii suraksha or aarthik hiton ke liye sidhaa khatra paidaa ho jayega
 India considers the entire region between the Gulf of Aden and the Strait of Malacca as part of its sphere of influence

 Naval planners dismiss the speculation that the motive behind this demand is to go to the South China Sea
 unki najar main nausena ke paas aisa karne ke liye, “na to kshamta he or na hi iraadaa
 "A senior official in the Ministry of Defense said," Our main focus is still the Indian Ocean

 Nuclear-powered submarines such as the Shang class can operate almost indiscriminately under water, different from common submarines
 30 nots se adhik gati se chalate hue ye pandubbiyaan jangi or vyapaarik jahaajon par hamale kar sakati hai or krooj mixilon se jameen par lakshya bhed sakati hai
 Therefore, the presence of Chinese SSN in the Indian Ocean may devastate the plans of the Indian Navy

 Their range, stamina and size are limited

 They may also hinder the deployment of slower Arihant nuclear powered submarines from their base in Visakhapatnam to the Bay of Bengal and beyond

 iske baad se china kii nausena ne yah kaam or jaldi karne kaa faisla kiya
 Since 2008, under the guise of preventing piracy, it has deployed warships in the Gulf of Aden to protect its merchant ships and sailors

 The first indigenous nuclear-powered ballistic missile is having difficulty carrying the submarine into the ocean and is not short of funds
 desh ne pichley ek dashak main paaramparik or parmaanu shakti chaalit pandubbiyaan banane par 6 arab dollar se adhik kharch kiye hai
 But the work has been delayed due to lack of long-term strategic vision within the Navy and delays from bureaucracy
 sab kuch pani menienes sindhu rakshak ke fatkar mumbai harbar main samaa jane se maheenon pehle nausena ne 14 pandubbiyon ke apane bede kii umr badhaane kaa prastaav kiya tha
 Such repairs will increase the lifespan of older submarines by seven years

 Even if approved, there will be no benefit
 marammat ke baad sudhari hui pandubbi maheene main 10 din kaam karegi, jabaki nai pandubbi 20 din uplabdh rahati he
 The Navy does not have new submarines

 The staff has increased as the fleet becomes smaller
 agar ek dashak pehle tak 12 pandubbiyon par 150 adhikari hote the to aaj saat pandubbiyon par 700 adhikari hai
 Submarine drivers have less time at sea, which in turn affects their training and efficiency
 itnaa hi nahin, ho saktaa he ki in chintaaon se china kii taraf se umadte khatre kaa andaja lagane main chook hui ho or kuch had tak udaseenta bhi aa gai ho
 In contrast, China has the largest military expansion in the world
 pichley hafte hi usne apana raksha bajet pichley saal ke 40 arab dollar se 12
 2 percent, while the actual budget will probably be 40 percent more
 isse vah anya chizon ke alaava 20 se adhik parmaanu shakti chaalit hamalavar pandubbiyon kaa bedaa taiyaar karegaa
 Here India will spend $ 6 billion in defense items this year
 phir bhi bharat ke raksha pratishthan main kuch logon ko chintaa nahin he
 a senior submarine expert says that they are not troubled by the deployment of SSN by the Chinese Navy because, "their reliability of deployment outside their submarine bases has not been confirmed yet
" unki esesain pandubbiyon ke bedadak chalane kii kshamta par abhi sawalia nishaan hai
 "there may be truth in this matter, yet India cannot afford to be relaxed in defense preparedness

 The first submarine, Arihant, was built in 2009, but has not been tested by the sea yet
 sarkaar ne abhi tak shang shrenee kii esesain jaisi chaar pandubbi kaa bedaa banane ke bare main nausena ke 2010 ke gopneey prastaav ko manjuuri nahin di he
 Meanwhile, the Navy is pushing for new conventional submarines

 kii dar se ye pandubbiyaan scorpian se badi hai
 Even though Chinese ssns have limited their utility

 76,000 crore in total to the Navy
 kii laagat se apane bede main 24 paramparaagat pandubbiyaan shaamil kerani hai
 Experts like Rear Admiral Menon do not see any difference in it
 unka kahana he ki nausena ko paramparaagat pandubbiyon kaa khyaal chhod dena chahie or america, france or britain kii tarah puri tarah parmaanu shakti sampann nausainik takat bananaa chahie
 But what is the Navy thinking about this? a naval officer says the changing strategic environment in the Indian Ocean could force another nuclear-powered bomber to lease submarines
 yah ek or samrik samasya ke prati ek or chaturaai bharaa samaadhaan he
 But the country has gone into election mode at this time
 jab sarkaar nae nausena adhyaksh kii tainaati karne kaa kaam bhi nahin kar paa rahi he, vah aachaar samhita ke samay main is tarah kaa koi faisla shaayad hi le
 If the government changes in the country in the current political environment, it will also take some time to settle down and take big decisions

 iran or morocco ke bich shuukravaar ko fifa vishwa cap kaa footbal match khelaa gaya
 In this, Iran scored Morocco in their first match on the basis of Aziz Bohadoz's suicide goal
 0 se haraa diya
 There was an interesting view during this match
 saint petersburg stadium main kai poster dikhe, jin par likhaa tha ki iran kii mahilaon ko stadium main pravesh ko samarthan karen
 Here women held posters in their hands, on which things were written against the Iranian order regarding the imperative of hijab and in support of women there
 bataa den ki iran main mahilaon ko stadium main purushon ke khel ke dauraan pravesh par manaahi he
 At the same time, she cannot even protest against it
 lekin rus ke saint petersburg sdadium main footbal match ke dauraan iran kii mahilaon ke stadium main entry ke samarthan main poster dikhe
 Let me tell you that in the last two years, two famous Indian athletes have refused to play the order of wearing hijab
 darasal, iran main mahilaon ko hijaab pahananaa anivaary he
 There is no disrespect to this rule
 asal main, pichley november main asian kabddi championships ke dauraan thailand mahila team ke purush coach ko hijaab pahanakar khel ke maidan main janaa padaa tha
 In the championship match held in Gorgan, Iran, India defeated Pakistan and captured the title
 is championships ke dauraan thailand team ke coach ne apane puure chehre ko dhak liya tha
 After which his pictures went viral on social media
 darasal, iran main purushon ko mahilaon ke khel ke dauraan stadium main pravesh karne par pabandi he
 Not only this, in 2016 Indian shooter Heena Sidhu refused to participate in the shooting championship in Iran
 kyonki vahaan par hijaab pahananaa anivaary tha
 Women have been dodging the rules
 Iran has imposed a number of stringent restrictions on women
 yahaan wo stadium main footbal kaa match nahin dekh saktin
 However, Iran's women change from spot to spot to reach the stadium
 kai mahilaayein dadhi-moonch or mechap ke saath stadium main pravesh paa jaati heniran mahilaon par stadium main kadam rakhane par lagi pabandi ke peeche kaa kaaran vahaan ke maahaul ko bataaya gaya he
 The reasoning is that the atmosphere inside the stadium is not according to women and the government and administration are not able to provide security to them
 isliye yah pabandi lagaai gai he
 Since the 1979 revolution in Iran, a number of stringent restrictions have been imposed on women here
 haalanki, hasan ruhani ke satta main aane ke baad se kai baar ye aawaaj uthi ki mahilaon par lage pratibandhon ko hataaya janaa chahie, lekin kuch ho na sakaa
 Please tell that Iranian women cannot walk on the road without a burqa
 saath hi unhen purushon ke saath sadak par chalane par bhi manaahi he
 However, at the end of 2017, the Iranian government gave big relief to the women and announced not to take them into custody for violating the dress code
