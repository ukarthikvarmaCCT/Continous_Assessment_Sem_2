 He is also mentioned in Dilip Kumar's biography, which came some time back

 In his biography, Dilip Kumar has said that Madhubala was a very lively and active human being
 unhen mere jaise sankochi or sharmile vyakti ke saath baat karne main koi dikkat nahin hoti thi
 But Madhubala's father had a lot of trouble with his love life
 dilip kumaar ne jeeta 11 saal purana cese, chaabi milte hi syra huin khushmadhubala kii choti bahan madhur bhushan ne bataaya he ki abba ko lagata tha ki dilip unase umr main bade hai
 While he was made for each other
 lekin abba kehete the yah sahi rasta nahin he
 Madhubala did not listen to him, she used to say that she loves him
 kuch samay baad biaar chopra ke saath 'nayaa daur' film ko lekar court cese ho gaya to mere walid or dilip sahab ke bich manmutav ho gaya
 Further, Madhur says that they also reached a settlement in the court
 uske dilip sahab ne madhubala ko kaha ki ki chalo ham log shaadi kar len
 On this Madhubala said that i will definitely get married but first you should apologize to my father
 lekin dilip kumaar ne aisa karne se manaa kar diya
 After this, Madhubala said that he was not apologizing, hug the father at home, but Dilip Kumar did not agree on this either
 janmdin nahin manaayenge dilip kumaar, mili he infections se bachane kii salaahusake baad un donon kaa rishta khatm ho gaya
 On February 23, 1969, at the age of just 35, Madhubala said goodbye to this world

 Because of this, there are three candidates of the same name
 or wo naam he jaranel singh
 One Jarnail Singh is an Aam Aadmi Party candidate and the other two Jarnail are independents who neither know the people of his colony nor they are seen campaigning
 aise main in naamon ko lekar rahasy paidaa ho gaya he
 Both the other Jarnail Singh are neither in their homes nor in the area for campaigning, so there remains a mystery about them, who is this Jarnail Singh, because you will be surprised to know that many times these two Jarnail Singh (one spoke directly to the other while the number which the other one has put in the nomination is incorrect and the second number belongs to his friend who kept talking about being busy again and again)
 Micro Their answers are busy election but they were not anywhere around
 itnaa hi nahin inke mohalle ke logon ko inke chunaav main khadey hone kii jaankaree tak nahin he
 Jarnail Singh, who hails from DDA Colony, Chaukhandi, Tilak Nagar, Harsharan Singh, resident of Chakhandi, said, "I know Jarnail of Aam Aadmi Party, but i do not know Jarnail in my neighborhood
 pratyaashee to aisa ho jise log jaane or wo logon ko jane
 Jarnail Singh who hails from MVS Nagar, Tilak Nagar
 emvies nagar ke gaganadip ne kaha 'aap' ke jaranel ko jaanate hai
 Whether or not there are any journals from here, they do not know
 na hi kabhi prachaar karte dekha he
 Some people also believe that it can be a conspiracy of some political party
 isse aam aadmi party ke nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 In the area, there is a confusion among the people of the constituency about the Aam Aadmi Party's two generals that AAP MLA Jarnail Singh is the Lok Sabha candidate
 jabaki asal main vidhayak jaranel singh loksabhaa chunaav nahin lard rahe he
 Rather, in the Lok Sabha elections, AAP candidate is former journalist Jarnail Singh, who came to discuss by throwing a shoe at P
 Chidambaram
 aam aadmi party ke vidhayak jaranel sinhaho saktaa he ki loksabhaa chunaav main aam aadmi party ko is kanfusion kaa khamiyaja uthaanaa pad jaae
 However, Aam Aadmi Party workers are trying to remove this confusion among the people

 Thanks for listening to all my nonsense for so many years

 He also promised his children Arjun and Sara that he would compensate for not spending so many years with them by spending more time with them

 Tendulkar also thanked the BCCI and MCA
 unhone saathi cricketron, sahyogi staff, doctoron or trainron ko bhi shukriya kaha

 There have been more than 50 incidents of confrontation between humans and tigers in the last year
 inamen pehali ghatana bijanour ke ek narbhakshi baagh kii thi jo saat hafton ke bheetar das jaane lilkar farvari 2014 main laapata ho gaya
 The latest incident is from Belagavi in karnataka in January 2015 where a tiger was killed by the locals
 wild life conjarveshan socity of india ke pramukh ulhas karant kehete hai, “yah sangrakshan kii kamyaabi kii keemat he
 Incidents of human confrontation are increasing in the same area where the tiger population has increased
 ” jangal kam hone se baagh kshamta se zyada bhare abhayaaranyon se nikalakar inasaani aabaadi vaale ilaakon main ghus rahe hai
 Karthik Satyanarayana, co-founder of Wildlife SOS, says, "scared and confused tigers attack by the loud noises, lights, noise of urban expansion
 khatre se ghira koi bhi jaanavar aisa hi karegaa
 "this is a battle in which everyone is losing: humans either lose their lives or kill tigers indiscriminately, injure or get caught

 "can India save its tigers and people from each other? Who's afraid of tigers?" What are you doing here? You don't know there's a tiger here? " Two forest guards equipped with rifles made a place on their bikes very fast and seated a man who arrived alone to collect wood in the forest
 lambey saal or jarul ke pedo se ghiri, choti-choti dhaaraon, khaaiyon se yukt uttar pradesh-uttarakhand seemaa par 33,399 hectare kii yah vanpattee baaghon ke liye behad mufeed jagah he
 Nevertheless, the forest officials face considerable difficulties in keeping people away from this dangerous forest
 kisi shortkat kii talash main ek yuvak badi teji se ek pagadendi par chalaa ja rahaa tha
 He asked, "you are not afraid of tigers?" He replied with a glowing smile, "I am in the Gorkha Rifles of the Indian Army
" mujhe kuch nahin hoga
 "on such a lonely road, 63-year-old Lal Singh, who owns that orange shirt, became the tenth victim of the cannibal tigress who had created terror in the Bijnor area since December 2013
 yah jaanate hue bhi ki ilaake main narbhakshi gum rahaa he, agar vah 10 farvari 2014 ko maweshiyon ko charaane ke liye baagh ke ilaake main na gaya hota to usne apni jaan na ganvaai hoti
 He had also asked his companions the same morning, "if the tiger catches me?" Yet he let his cattle go so much into the forest

 Far from the blue mountains of pauri-garhwal, misty darkness is passing down

 As soon as rain comes, this river starts causing havoc
 barhapur or sahuwala range ke bich yahi vah dhara he jisamen roj shaam ko bijanour ke vanyapraani pani pine ke liye aate hai
 This is also the place from where men and women from small villages along the banks of the forest pass for their daily work

 32-year-old Lakshman Das of Barhapur village carries the farm produce on his old shabby bike daily to the nearby villages of Kho

 The evening was dark and the sound of bells from distant temples was heard
 achaanak use ganne ke kheton ke najadik baagh dikhaai diya jo use ghur rahaa tha
 He explains, "I thought my death was certain today
 vah billi kii tarah meri taraf badaae laga
 "as Das accelerated his bike's accelerator, the tiger also started running

 It is no surprise that few people like Laxman Das remain alive to tell their story
 bijanour main saal bhar main maare gaye sabhi 11 log laaparvaahee yaa dussahas ke kaaran baagh kaa shikaar hue
 Local journalist and tiger-lover Abid Raza said, "most of the victims were either sitting in the tiger area, or leaning down
 baagh aksar is sthiti main hi insaan par hamalaa karata he
 Or they had entered a dense forest where the tiger is resting during the day
 ”jangal aakhir he kahankaarant kehete hai, “jahaan bhi baaghon kii aabaadi bad rahi hoti he, vahaan har saal baagh 20 fisadi zyada ho jate hai
 Out of these, old, injured or zealous young tigers come out of the area and confront humans
 ” isaki vajah he jangalon kaa ghatana
 a report released in 2013 by the National Tiger Conservation Authority and the Wildlife Institute of India stated that between 2006 and 2010, the area of tigers had decreased by 12,000 square kilometers — a three-fold decrease in the size of Goa
 has gone
 bhartiya van survey ke anusaar, uttar pradesh ne pichley do saal main lagbhag 2 varg kilometre van kshetra kho diya he
 In this too, Bijnor has lost the most — in 2003 there was 12 percent forest area which has now come down to less than nine percent
 aise main hairat kii baat nahin ki bijanour ke jangal sabase zyada dabaav main hai
 People constantly go to the forest — to bring wood to burn, trees, fruits, honey, fodder for cattle, soil, etc
, or only as a way to get to the other side
 phir ganne ke khet hai jo thik jangal ke kinare tak faile hai
 There are weak fences between the forest and the fields
 ranger kamalesh kumaar kehete hai, “log yah nahin samaj pate ki ganne ke khet baagh ke liye jangal kii ghaas se koi khaas alag nahin hai
 “the entire winter sugarcane crop stands in the forest
 apane ilaake se beghar baagh vahiin sharan bhi letaa he
 As soon as the harvesting time approaches, the tiger is confronted by humans
 “jab ve lagaataar inasaanon ke ird-gird rahane lagate hai to ve unke itane abhyast ho jate hai ki inasaanon se swaabhaavik bhay kho dete hai or maweshiyon ko shikaar banane kii taraf aakarshith ho jate hai
 "the importance of the Tiger Corridor connecting one forest to another increases here which ensures the tigers move, breed, and maintain gene flow
" bhartiya baaghon ke diene sample kaa adhyayan karne vaali america ke smithsonian conjarveshan biology institute kii team ke praanivigyaani sandip sharma kehete hai, “sadaken or rail line in coridor se hokar guzar rahi hai, vahaan khanan, shaharikaran or anya tarah kaa dhanchaagat vikaas ho rahaa he, jisaki vajah se abhayaaranyon ke bich baaghon kaa avaagaman baadhit hota he
 "living with tigers two hundred years ago from 40,000 tigers now more than just 2,000 tigers: that is, eight generations of rural communities living around forests that have gradually become habitual populations of dwindling tigers and have forgotten that coexistence with wildlife How can it be made
 hyderabad ke tiger shooter nawab shafqat ali khan, jinase bijanour baghin ko lekar bhi mashvira kiya gaya tha, kehete hai, “ateet main gaanv vaale baaghon ko phir se jangal kii taraf modeye ke liye behad kargar tareeke aajamaaya karte the
 That information is now lost
 ”bijanour main do bacchon kii maa resha kahati hai, “jab bhi ham baagh ke bare main sunate hai to ham kai log saath chalate hai, jor-jor se gaanaa gaate hai or bachche skool janaa band kar dete hai
 "ever since Fibrea has seen the bodies of tiger-hunted people, he gets fever every night
 ab kabhi bhi phir se baagh ke hamale hote hai, jaise ki aktubar 2014 main hue the, to gaanv vaale bavaal kaatane lagate hai, jangalon kii chaukiyon ko gher lete hai or maamla apane haathon main lene kii dhamkee lene lagate hai
 Reesha says, "after Lal Singh was killed people were shouting, give us guns, we kill the tigress
 ” khan kehete hai, “baagh apane peeche dushman inasaanon ko chhod jate hai
 "for a poor villager, losing his cattle is like losing his life
 agar koi mar jaae to sarkaar se muaavja vasuulana or bhi kathin he
 He says, "then people start trying to hide the animal themselves, sometimes they will keep the corpse of a cattle poisoned to trap a tiger, sometimes they will mix insecticides in ponds or rivers
" jangal ke kareeb rahane vaala har bhartiya jangal-virdohi ho jaataa he
 "things have become normal in Bijnor now
 laal singh ko “santya” ghoshit kar diya gaya he, jisane gaanv waalon ko bachaane ke liye apni jaan qurbaan kar di
 The Panchayat also performed a havan to pray for protection from God
 gaanv ke bade-bujurgon kaa maananaa he ki baghin ko kisi sarkas party ne hi chhod diya hoga, varanaa vah achaanak kahaan gaayab ho jaati? gaanv vaale phir se bekhauf hokar jangal main ja rahe hai or apni manmarjee se uskaa istemaal bhi kar rahe hai

 China used veto At the beginning of the month, China used a veto against Masood Azhar for being declared a terrorist by the United Nations and said that it was not a perfomance of the Security Council standards made for it
 aisa pehali baar nahin he jab china ne pakistani aatanki sanghathan par pratibandh ko lekar bharat kaa virodh kiya ho
 In Lakhvi's case too, the road was banned by the United Nations, declaring jaish-e-mohammed as a terrorist organization in 2001, but still in the way of India's demand for a ban on Masood Azhar after the 2008 Mumbai attacks
 China itself was stuck
 yahi nahin, beete saal july main bhi china ne bharat kii us koshish ko jhatka diya tha jisamen sanyukt raashtra se 2008 mumbai hamalon ke master mind jackieurrahaman lakhvi par pratibandh lagane kii maang kii gai thi

 kashmir main mahabuuba sarkaar se samarthan vaapasi ke liye aemoes kaa kaaphi dabaav tha
 Kashmir was at the center of discussion in the last two BJP-RSS coordination meetings
 pichley saal sitambar ke vrundavan or haal main surajkund kii baithak main kashmir main bigadate halaat par vichaar kiya gaya tha
 It seems only after these discussions that the BJP decided to withdraw its support from the PDP in Kashmir
 iconomic times ke anusaar, in baithkon main is par vichaar hua tha ki jammu-kashmir ke halaat sudhaarney ke liye pidipi-bijepi sarkaar kya prayaas kar rahi he
 It also came out of the opinion that something has to be done to stop the growing radicalism among the Kashmiri youth
 aresas ke kuch varisht netaaon ke anusaar, surajkund baithak main jammu-kashmir keareses kekuch pramukh kaaryakartaaon ne shikaayat kii thi ki jammu main vikaas kaary na hone kii vajah se ve hatotsahit hai, jabaki centre sarkaar ne rajya ko jabardast aarthik package diya tha
 In March this year, a meeting of RSS officials was also held in Jammu, in which several senior leaders from Nagpur headquarters also attended
 is baithak main yah baat saamne rakhi gai ki rajya sarkaar ko kashmir main aatankiyon se sakhti se pesh aane kii jarurat he
 Many RSS leaders say that they have been informing the BJP for the last six months how the state's condition was deteriorating
 lekin party ne mahabuuba sarkaar se samarthan vaapasi par vichaar kaaphi soch-samaj kar kiya
 It is said that in the meeting of Surajkund, Amit Shah took information about the feedback received from the grassroots workers of the Sangh, especially about Kashmir and UP from its leaders
 iske baad mangalvaar ko ghoshnaa se pehlgamit shahrashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal se mili
 Recently, the Sangh has also changed its office-bearers in Kashmir
 ramesh pappa kii jagah roopesh kumaar ko jammu-kashmir kaa nayaa praant prachaarak banaaya gaya he
 a post shared by Elif (@ efsall55) on Jun 20, 2018 at 9:44 pm PDTA post shared by Being Shera (@beingshera) on Jun 19, 2018 at 9:14 pm PDT ghode kii naal, ghode ke khur main lagaai jaati he, taaki na to ghode ko samasya ho or na hi ghode kii sawari karne vaale ko
 It is u shaped
 iske vishesh prabhaav ke kaaran shani or rahu se iskaa sambandh joda jaataa he
 It is believed that Saturn and Rahu are always controlled due to the special effect and shape of the horseshoe
 agar ghode kii naal kaa galat tareeke se prayog kii jaae to yah mushkil main daal sakati he
 Why and how the horseshoe can control Saturn? - Saturn is the planet of speed, struggle and hard work, and the same quality is also in the horseshoe
 - ghode kii naal ghode ke pairon main lagi hone ke kaaran gatisheel avasthaa main rahati he
 - Repeatedly, it is worn and clashed with the ground
 - ragad khate rahane ke kaaran isamen chumbakeey prabhaav aa jaataa he
 - And it is due to this magnetic effect that the horseshoe can control Saturn
 kis prakaar karen ghode kii naal kaa prayog taaki shani pidaa se mukti mili?- kisi mangalvaar yaa brihaspativaar ko ghode kii naal le len
 - The more old and worn the placenta is, the better it will be
 - is naal se ek anguthi banavaa len
 - But the ring should be made only by beating, do not heat it in fire
 - shanivaar ko is anguthi ko sarson ke tel se dhokar, madhyamaa anguli main dhaaran kar len
 What is Vat Savitri fast, how do you do it? Know how to use the horseshoe to bring peace to the house? - Bring the horseshoe home on Tuesday or Thursday
 - ise sarson ke tel main dubokar rakh den
 - Put it in the shape of u in the middle at the top of the house on Saturday evening
 - ab nity saayam ise dhoop dikhaaen
 - There will be happiness, peace and prosperity in the house
 karmchaaree bhavishya nidhi sanghathan (ipiefo) or neshnal pension system (enpies) ne pehali baar apane yahaan khule khaaton kaa data saarvajanik kiya he
 It is being said that this will give relief to the central government on the employment front
 donon sanghathanon main khule khaaton ke aadhaar par sanket milte hai ki sitambar 2017 se farvari 2018 ke bich kii chamahi main 18 se 25 saal ke 31 lakh nae rojgaar srujit hue hai, yani har maheene kareeb paanch lakh rojgaar
 Of these, 22 lakh jobs are from the organized sector
 sanket isliye, kyonki in aankadon ko rojgaar maan lenaa sahi nahin hoga
 On the other hand, according to Labor Bureau data, only 4 in fiscal year 2017
 16 lakh naukariyon kaa srijan ho paaya
 At the same time, the International Workers' Union (ILO) recently estimated that by 2019, the employment situation in India will be pathetic and three times as many youths in the age group of 15 to 25 will be unemployed
 aaie jaanate hai ki rojgaar ke aankadon se kaise khel rahi he sarkaar
 The data included the EPFO and NPS figures that 18 of the EPAO in the last six months
 5 lakh khate khule or enpies ke 3
 5 lakh accounts are opened and both are being presented as new employment figures
 agar ek hi naukareepesha shaks kaa ipiefo or enpies main khaataa ho to uske do khaaton ke aadhaar par do naukariyaan maan liye jane kaa khatra he
 Since the income tax of any employee is deducted in his institute itself and many institutions have to declare new financial year investment between September and February
 aise main tex bachaane ke liye is avadhi main enpies main khate khole jate hai
 Apart from this, a resident of India or NRI from 18 years to 60 years of age can also open an account in NPS
 isliye enpies khate kaa matlab nayaa rojgaar nahin he
 According to several accounts of the same job, these figures do not include accounts lying idle for a year
 haalanki, isse bhi puri tarah se bharosemand aankade saamne aane kii ummid nahin he
 The reason for this is that those people who have changed jobs between September and February will have more than one account of EPFO
 naukari chhodane ke baavjood ipiefo khate main rakhi rakam par teen saal tak acha byaaj miltaa he
 Because of this, this money is not withdrawn for three years
 aise main rojgaar ke pesh kiye ja rahe aankadon main doharaav kii galati hone kii puri gunjaaish he
 These figures can be considered reliable only if the EPFO account remains old even after changing jobs or it can be ensured that a person will have only one EPFO account in the country
 notebandi or jiesti kii madadbhaarat main arthvyavastha or rojgaar kaa bada hissaa (kareeb 80 fisadi) asangathit kshetra se aata he
 Barring a few cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, the living and employment methods are still far away from the big cities and in the unorganized sector
 pichley saal november main bhartiya arthvyavastha main notebandi or uske baad jiesti lagu hone ke baad asangathit kshetra ke karmchaariyon or udhyamiyon ko (apane karmchariyon sahit) sangathit kshetra main aana padaa he
 Due to this, the employment in the unorganized sector till now has shifted to the organized sector and it cannot be said to be right in the category of employment generation
 survey kii takanic bharosemand nahinaankadebaaji ke is khel main ek sawaal yah bhi uth rahaa he ki ipiefo or enpies samet duusari sevaaon main darj hone vaale aankade jamini sachai se kitne dur hai
 An institution must have at least 20 employees to be registered with EPFO
 iske alaava ek karmchaaree kii selary 15 hajaar rupee maheene se zyada hone par hi use ipiefo seva main darj kiya jaataa he
 Many companies provide short-term employment, ie, three-month or six-month contracts are given time-bound work
 ipiefo seva main darj hue in logon ko alag karne ke liye koi takanic nahin apanaai gai he
 In such a situation, assuming all these new jobs will also be considered as exaggerating data
 abhi karnaa hoga intjaaris tarah se kam avadhi ke rojgaar or aarthik sudhaaron ke baad asangathit kshetra se sangathit kshetra main darj hote khaaton ko bhi nae rojgaar ke taur par pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 It would be better to wait for some time to know the reality of them
 chunki ab enpies or ipiefo ke aankade saarvajanik kshetra main hai to notebandi kii agali kuch timahi yaa chamahi kaa vishleshan baari-baari karnaa hoga
 Not only this, the study of employment data before demonetisation can also reveal new things
 in sabake baad hi bharat main rojgaar kii asli surat saamne aa sakegi
 Is this the government's move? Saumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Advisor at the State Bank of India and Professor Pulak Ghosh at IIT Bangalore, released a 33-page report on the EPFO and NPS data even before the budget was announced this year
 isamen 2017-18 main 70 lakh naukariyaan milane kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya tha
 Till then the figures of EPFO and NPS were not in the public domain and questions were raised about the achievement of these two economists
 ab jaakar ye aankade public domen main aae hai
 Remind you that before the 2014 general elections, PM Narendra Modi had promised 1 crore jobs every year, which has not been completed even once in the last four years
 li kiye gaye aankadon kii madad se report main sangathit kshetra main 70 lakh or asangathit kshetra main 80 lakh yani har saal 1
 5 crore employment generation was estimated
 yani sarkaar ko is report se kaaphi madad mili thi
 Modi was revealed after the report, it will be fun for you to know that every year in China, a country with five times the economy of India, 1
 5 karod rojgaar srujit nahin ho pate hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi was seen in some TV interviews after both Ghosh's helpful reports came out
 isse pehle modi kii media ke sawaalon se duuri banane par aalochana hoti thi
 After the report came out, Modi had vaguely stated on the question of employment that employment born in the unorganized sector should also be considered as the achievement of his government
 iske liye unhone sadak kinare pakora bechney waalon ke rojgarayukt hone kaa udhaaharan diya tha
 The government will use these figures
 The figures of EPFO and NPS have come at a time when important elections are to be held in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh after Karnataka
 karnataka main bijepi kii koshish he ki congress ko hataakar satta main aae
 In Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, the BJP has to face the anti-incumbency factor apart from internal camp
 iske alaava 2019 main loksabhaa chunaav hone hai, jinhen sarkaar kuch samay pehle bhi karvaa sakati he
 In such a situation, the Central Government can count its achievement by presenting these figures as employment

 But the bees are still hovering

 Now waiting to calm down, the police managed to park the truck with the help of JCB, but even after 12 hours the bees have not calmed down and are hovering
 maukey par maujuud adhikari or pulicekarmi bhi gaadi ke shishe band kar inke shant hone kaa intjaar kar rahe hai ki ye apane dibbon main jaakar baithen
 According to the information, the truck was in Punjab number
 a truck of Punjab number was going from Jaipur towards Churu
 madhumakhiyaan paalane ke liye le jaai ja rahi thim
 Shortly after leaving Ratanagar, the truck overturned unbalanced

 The plan to make mid-day meal on gas stove in all primary schools of Jharkhand government has not been realized till now
 jisaki vajah se jharkhand ke 70 fisadi se adhik primary or apper primary skulon ke bachche dhuna jhelane ko vivash hai
 In fact, the state government had planned to give LPG cylinders and stove to schools for the designated day meal, but it could not be done till the beginning of the financial rule

 There were plans to provide 4 stove and 5 five cylinders
 lekin padaadhikariyon kii susti or vittiya niyamon ke pench ke kaaran abhi tak iskaa anupaalan nahin ho sakaa
 The situation is that despite the scheme being approved by the cabinet in May this year, the schools have not been able to get the ALPG cylinder and stove
 bataaya jaataa he ki nae tregeri code ke tahat vitt vibhaag ne yojana kii raashi tregeri ke madhyam se piel khate main rakhane kaa nirdesh diya tha
 But there was a problem in this that the amount will be released from the treasury only after giving the voucher of the expenditure
 jabaki yah bilkul nai yojana hob niyam ko shithil karne kii ho rahi he maakebrajya kaa shiksha vibhagasarkaar se ek baar ke liye niyamon ko shithil karne kii maang kar rahaa he, jisase inkaa kray kiya ja sake
 The scheme is estimated to cost around Rs 42 crore
 jisamen gas silendar, regulator, pipe evam bhatthi, chuulhe shaamil hai
 Their purchase will be done by Saraswati Corps in schools
 iske liye raashi unke bank khaaton main transfar kii jaaegi

 The whirlwind of Rajya Sabha membership in the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) came to an end on the third date of January 2018 but the political future of the party's national executive and Rajasthan in-charge Kumar Vishwas has been questioned
 rajyasabha prakaran ke patakshep ke tareeke se yah nishkarsh bhi niklaa ki aap bhi chunaav jeetne kii raajnneeti kii taraf badhati dikh rahi he
 The top AAP leadership, which is going to complete two years in power in Delhi, has tried to strike a balance between the future prospects of the organization and the party in announcing the names of three Rajya Sabha candidates

 D
 gupta ko party kaa rajyasabha tikat mila he to susheel gupta ke naam par piesi kii baithak main khud ashutosh ne aapatti jataai
 Ashutosh said that the rich would become anti-attackers in the name of Sushil Gupta and his propaganda would damage the party's image
 zyaadaatar log kahenge ki aam aadmi party ne daulatmand shaks ko tavajjo di
 But the number of leaders who believed that Mallya would send us to Parliament will attack us
 sanjay singh ko party main varishthata ke aadhaar par chunaa gaya
 His name was unquestionably decided
 vahiin en
 D
 gupta jane maane sie hai or institute of chartered accountint of india ke adhyaksh bhi rah chuke hai
 He belongs to Haryana and the party has been seeking his opinion from time to time
 ve kejariwal ke puraane parichit hai
 He is highly respected in the Vaishya community and there is no dispute with him
 susheel gupta ke haryana ke udhyami or samajasevi hai
 They have schools in every district of Haryana and they have a significant presence in the Vaishya Samaj institutions of every district
 aap ko lagata he ki haryana main congress kamjor he or bhaajapa ke prati logon main naaraazgi he or iskaa phayda use ho saktaa he
 For this reason, he has given party ticket to Sushil Gupta in Haryana with 15% Vaishya population
 sanyog hi he ki khud arvind kejariwal bhi haryana se hai or vaisya samudaay se hai
 His proximity to Sushil Gupta can be gauged from the fact that Sushil Gupta's website has 40 photographs with Kejriwal in 60 photos found in the gallery
 susheel gupta kaa vajandaar or kejariwal kaa najdiki hona unke kaam aayaa
 But Faith could not gain the trust of her leader by being 'close'
 rajyasabha ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa hone se party ke asantusht chal rahe netaa or kavi vishwaas media ke saamne fat pade
 He described Sushil Gupta and ND Gupta as great revolutionaries in a tone filled tone and congratulated the selection
 unhone kaha, ''mujhe sach bolne kaa puraskaar dand ke rup main diya gaya
 The next day, Delhi AAP convenor Gopal Rai said that after the MCD elections in April last year, there were beliefs at the center of the conspiracy to topple the Kejriwal government
 baharhaal, aap ke do rajyasabha ummidavaaron par duusare logon ne bhi sawaal uthaae
 Yogendra Yadav, who left you, tweeted, "I told so many people in the last three years that whatever other defects are there in Kejriwal but no one can buy it
" aaj samaj nahin paa rahaa hum ki kya kahuun? hairaan hum, stabdh hum, sharmasaar bhi
 However, AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan, who has been an outspoken opponent of not giving the ticket to Vishwas, says that the party took a better decision
 ab vishwaas kaa rajnatik kariyar mushkil main he
 He is in charge of Rajasthan and elections are held there this year
 party ne abhi rajasthan chunaav ladgaye kaa faisla nahin kiya he lekin is maamle main use faisla jald karnaa hoga
 If the party contests elections, it is expected that Vishwas should not be in charge of Rajasthan
 baharhaal, piesi kii baithak main vishwaas nahin pahunche
 The party is not satisfied with his going to Rajasthan only four times in seven months
 ab dekhnaa he ki pahal vishwaas karte hai yaa party
 However, one thing is evident from the Rajya Sabha ticket case that you too have walked on the lines of other parties
 yahaan bhi asantusht yaa gaiyr-vafaadaar netaaon kaa vahi hashr hoga jo anya partiyon main hota aayaa he
 It will be interesting to see how you will present alternative politics

 Former Indian team opener Gautam Gambhir described himself as a 'traditionalist' who likes to play long format against red ball and during the day, adding that any kind of experiment should be done only in T20 cricket
 gambhir nedlip trophyce final ke baad kaha, ‘main paramparawaadi hum jo puraane tareeke se cricket khelnaa pasand karata he

 Leaving his statement incomplete, Advani said, 'I have personally felt that referring to Jinnah as someone who wanted a secular country with a Muslim majority population

 Advani had to resign from the post of party president after Jinnah was declared secular during his 2005 visit to Pakistan
 unhone is ghatana kaa zikr kal shaam phir se jane maane patrkaar emje akbar kii kitaab ‘tinderbox

 Advani was forced to quit as president after several leaders within the RSS and BJP openly criticized him and demanded his resignation, calling Jinnah secular
 aresas or bhaajapa ne baad main adwani ke prati apana rukh naram kar diya or unhen chunaav main pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke rup main pesh kiya 
 Yesterday, at the book's launch, Advani again referred to Jinnah as secular and attributed the political instability of Pakistan to people like Maulana Abul Ala Maududi who propounded the doctrine of the two-nation
 unhone taanashaah jiya ul haq ko bhi pakistan kii raajnneetik asthirataa kaa jimmedaar bataaya
 Supporting Akbar's views in the book, Advani said, "he (the author) is right that Pakistan can become a stable and modern country only when the children of Jinnah, the father of Pakistan, can defeat the ideological heirs of Maududi
" ’ adwani ne lekhak se sahamat hote hue aage kaha ‘jinna pakistan ke janak ho sakate hai lekin dharm pita maududi tha or iskaa asar kaaphi vyapak tathaa bada tha
 "advocating his case in the Jinnah case," Advani said, "his first comment in the Constituent Assembly was one to which many people in India, especially those of me like him, said
 
 What is this? You can see Jinnah as someone who wanted Pakistan to be a secular country
 ’ bhaajapa ke varisht netaa is rukh par kaayam the ki pakistan main asthirataa ‘nishchit taur par bharat ke liye khatra’ he lekin unhone isse asahmati jataayi ki vah khandit ho jayega

 Referring to the assassination of Salman Taseer, the governor of Pakistan's Punjab province, Advani said that such an incident does not happen in India

 Film director Faisal Saif has renamed his upcoming film 'main Hoon Rajinikanth' to 'main Hoon Rajni' after superstar Rajinikanth's objection
 unka kahana he ki chunki film nirmaataa kaa paisa daanv par tha, isliye unhen aisa karnaa padaa
 Superstar Rajinikanth felt that the film's old name would probably tarnish his image and disgust his fans, so he filed an interim petition in the court against its name and content
 faisal ne ek bayaan main kaha, "mere nirmaataa ne chennai jaakar rajani sar kii team ke adhivaktaaon va kuch anya mehmaanon ko film dikhaai, jinhone paaya ki meri film kaa superstar se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 " faisal ne purv main film kaa naam badalane se inkaar kar diya tha, lekin unka kahana he ki film nirmaataa kaa paisa daanv par laga tha, isliye unhen naam badalanaa padaa
 The film will be released on October 17
 farvari se hi nitin gadakari kii kismat ghota lagane lagi thi
 Then the stage collapsed due to being overloaded during an election meeting in Uttar Pradesh, on which Gadkari was sitting
 uttar pradesh ke chunaav main apni party ke kharaab pradarshan se lekar apni purti samooh kii companiyon main aniyamitata ke aarope tak, 55 varshiya gadakari is saal ko bhul hi janaa chahenge
 Now, for the second time, the possibility of him becoming BJP President also seems complicated
 party ne ise mumkin banane ke liye samvidhan main badlaav kiya tha
 Several senior party leaders like LK Advani, Yashwant Sinha and Jaswant Singh have indicated that Gadkari has now lost the moral ground to continue as president
 gadakari ke puri tarah se lage rahane ke baavjood uttar pradesh ke chunaav main party khet rahi
 All his experiments with the promise of "shocking results" failed
 aresas ke vivaadaaspad padaadhikari sanjay joshi ko laane or ghotaale ke daagi bispi netaa babusingh kushvaha ko party main shaamil karne kaa ulataa nateeja hua
 The manner in which Gadkari decided to support Independent MLA Anshuman Mishra in the election for the Rajya Sabha seat from Jharkhand in March also led to criticism from the RSS which always supported him enthusiastically
 isi tarah bijepi kii sarkaar vaale ekmaatr dakshin bhartiya rajya karnataka main vivaad se gadakari jis tarah nipate or bi
 s
 yediurppa ke prati narmi dikhaai, uski adwani ne bhi khulkar aalochana kii
 Party leaders feel that these steps of Gadkari are hurting bjp's anti-corruption campaign
 unka sochna thik hi he
 The BJP has failed to take advantage of the rising anger against the UPA over rising prices and corruption
 pehle kabhi bhi kisi mudde par bijepi is tarah banty nahin dikhi
 Now the RSS is also interfering in small matters of the party through Gadkari
 duusari taraf, gadakari apane aalochakon ko galat sabit karne main naakaam rahe hai
 In one of his speeches in Bhopal on 4 November, he compared Swami Vivekananda, the bjp's emblem, to Dawood Ibrahim of the underworld, saying that the two probably had the same intellectual standard
 unke shabd the, ‘‘vivekanand ne iskaa istemaal raashtra nirmaan, bhaichaare or aadhyatmikta ke liye kiya, jabaki daaud ne iskaa istemaal aparaadh kii duniya main aage badaae ke liye kiya
 "there is a very fine line between pragmatism and opportunism and Gadkari has crossed this line," says a senior BJP leader
 ” Hearing of Unnao rape case is going on in Tis Hazari Court of Delhi

 Let me tell you that during the earlier hearing, the CBI had told the judge that during his investigation it was clear that Kuldeep Singh Sengar's allegations of raping the victim on June 4, 2017 and involvement in Shashi Singh's conspiracy are true
 isi ke aadhaar par court main chargeshit daayar kii gai thi
 The CBI had told the court that Shashi Singh took the victim to Kuldeep Singh Sengar's house on the pretext of getting him a job
 peedita ne sibiai ko jo bayaan die usko sibiai ne jaj ke saamne rakhaa tha
 The CBI had told the court that at that time there was no one at (home)
 vahaan par suraksha karmi bhi nahin the
 The victim did not tell anyone in the house about going there
 shashi use peeche ke daravaaje se ghar ke andar le gaya
 As soon as the victim was entering inside her house, Kuldeep Singh Sengar appeared to her, she took the victim's hand and took it inside the room
 is maamle main supreme court ke aadesh par aaropee vidhayak kuldeep singh senger ko dilli kii tihaad jail main shift kar diya gaya he
 The victim has also been brought to AIIMS for treatment
 jahaan uskaa upachaar chal rahaa he
 The injured victim's lawyer has also been brought to AIIMS
 vah abhi coma main hai
 The Supreme Court ordered the CBI to make proper arrangements for the stay of the victim's family around AIIMS
 saath hi sibiai se gavaahon kii suraksha par sil band report maangi gai he
 Tis Hazari Court has also issued directions to the DGP of Uttar Pradesh in the case of witnesses
 saath hi peedit ke vakeelon ko cese se jude tamaam dastavej muhaiyaa karwaane kaa bhi farmaan sunaaya gaya he
 Cricketer Virat Kohli and actress Anushka Sharma got married on December 11
 donon ne italy ke florence main shaadi kii
 Pictures of this three-day destination wedding are becoming viral on social media
 family or khaas doston kii maujuudagi main sampann hui is shaadi se judi abtak sari khabaren phens ko pasand ai hai
 But the design and photographer have also collided in this wedding
 viraat-anoushka ke diziner sabyasachi mukherjee or photographer joseph radhik ke bich soshal media par manmutav ho gaya
 It happened that Sabyasachi shared photos of anushka-virat's wedding on her Instagram account to show off her designs after marriage
 lekin sabyasachi ne joseph kii clic kii hui in photose main unhen photo credit dena bhi jaruri nahin samajha
 'fufa' annoyed by virat-anushka's wedding, such a joke on Twitter The royal portrait
 Made this image of these two while standing in a narrow hallway
 Lit them with an Icelight held by @noeldavidraj
 While my favorite from this series is a different image, @anushkasharma seems to really like this particular version
 So here it is
 😁 It's so strange to make a portrait of someone who's been photographed so many times! When i first met these two, Anushka said "all i want is my wedding moments to be captured and i don't want anything filmy!"
 This was music to my ears but i also really wanted to make a couple of timeless posed portraits and we negotiated a window of 3-5mins per event to make a portrait
 This was one of them! 😍 # portraitsbyjr # rsa_portraits # sonyalpha # portraitproject # portraitinspiration # portraitpage # moodygrams # fatalframes # discoverportrait # agameoftones # artofvisuals # humanedge # virushka # viratanushka # weddedwonderland # wedphotoinspiration # instalove # instawedding # love # bride # indianbride # bigfatindianweddinga post shared by Joseph Radhik (@josephradhik) ondec 12, 2017 at 3:10am pstisa baat se naaraaz joseph ne apane soshal media handle par viraat-anoushka kii sagaai kii photo share karte hue ye post kii
 Joseph wrote that Anushka wanted her wedding photos to be in portrait frame, so we tried to click every photo with the same angle
 or ye photo unamem se ek he
 Joseph further said that i am sad that Sabyasachi's team used this photo to do their work show
 or unhone photo credit dena bhi jaruri nahin samajha
 Anushka wore this jhumka at her wedding, Deepika has also done a try @ anushkasharma @virat

 Akshay Kumar will soon be seen on the big screen with the film "kesari"
 akshay ke filmi kariyar ko dekhen to actor ne kai utaar-chadhaav dekhe hai
 But in Bollywood, the actor himself revealed which film is close to Akshay's heart in the career of Aaj Tak
 unhone bataaya, film "vakt-e res against time" hameshaa mere dil ke sabase zyada kareeb he
 Akshay Kumar told, "while i was working in time, my father was battling cancer
 sabase ajeeb ye tha ki film main bhi meraa role real jaisaa tha
 Even in that story my father was battling cancer
 " akshay ne kaha, "jab aap film dekhenge to wo seen real lagegaa
 The reason for this is that in both the film and the real shot, the father was suffering from cancer
 ""jab seen khatm ho gaya, uske baad bhi apane imoshan ko roak nahin paaya
 This is the reason why the film is closest to me

 The Congress party has removed Rajkumar Patel from the post of General Secretary of Madhya Pradesh Congress
 congress ne patel ko vidisha se congress kaa tikat diya tha lekin 'e' farm nahin hone ke kaaran unka namination khaarij ho gaya

 agarwal ne party pramukh arvind kejariwal ko likhe ek patr main kaha ki baad main chijen badalati najar aane lageen or jin uddeshyon or lakshyon par yah bani thi, ve khote ja rahe hai
 The movement is becoming insensitive, raising doubts in the minds of people, even today people like me feel that the party is acting like a private limited company
 party ke liye kaam karne vaale logon ko nyaay dilaane ke party ke daawey par chintaa jataate hue agarwal ne kaha ki party kaa aam aadmi ke saath sampark kam ho rahaa he
 Groups of elite people were encouraged to take charge in the party
 aam aadmi kaa khyal pichhali seat lene kaa tha or aise logon kaa iraadaa aam aadmi ke sapanom par vyaktigat pariyojnaayen puri karne kaa he
 Aggarwal said that the loss appears to be due to this feeling of frustration and that commitment does not make any sense
 unhone kaha ki vah un logon ke saath nyaay karne main sakasham nahin hai, jinke liye vah andolan kaa hissaa bane the

 There were only 35 incursions in its first 7 months

 jaish-e-mohammed terrorists are being trained in these camps

 Significantly, on February 14 this year, a suicide attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, in which 44 soldiers were killed
 loksabhaa chunaav ke thik pehle hua yah aatanki hamalaa modi sarkaar ke liye badi chunauti ban gaya tha

 anya khabaren : The country is in a period of economic crisis
 iconomi ke lagbhag sabhi aankade niraash karne vaale aa rahe hai
 In such a situation, PM Modi has remembered the people of the 'bhamashah' ie business-industry
 piem modi ne kaarobaariyon ko 'velth creatre' bataaya he
 In the speeches of the Prime Ministers from Red Fort, there is usually little talk of business and industry people, but this time PM Modi said that businessmen are essential for the development of the country and said that they need to be seen with respect
 piem modi ne 73wein swatantraaa diwas ke avasar par lalakile kii pracheer se apane bhaashan main kaha, 'hamaari companiyaan or hamaare udhyami duniya ke bazaar main jane kaa sapana dekhen, hamaare niveshak zyada kamaayen, zyada nivesh karen, zyada rojgaar paidaa karen, ham isko protsaahit karne ke liye puri tarah taiyaar he
 PM Modi, who is serving the country, described the businessmen as wealth creators or wealth creators and said that those who create the wealth of the country are serving the country, let us not look at them with fear
 desh main velth creat karne waalon kaa utana hi maan-sammaan hona chahie
 If there is no wealth creation then the poor man will not do well
 jo log velth creat karne main lage hai ve hamaare desh ke liye bhi sampada hai
 Given the crisis, there was a possibility that PM Modi would speak to the Red Fort on the economy
 piem modi ne arthvyavastha ke liye koi bada elaan to nahin kiya, lekin kaarobaariyon ke yogadan ko yadakar desh nirmaan main unki mahatvapurn bhoomika ko rekhaankit kiya
 Why is PM important? In the last several years, due to the scam of many businessmen like Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and loan default of many businessmen, there was a negative image in the public about the businessmen and industrialists of the country
 
 piem modi yah jaanate hai ki arthvyavastha main sankat ke is daur main kaarobaariyon kaa utsaah badhaane kii jarurat to he hi, janata main unki chhavi bhi sudhaarney kii jarurat he
 For the creation of jobs and the rapid growth of the economy, it is necessary that the businessmen and industries of the country be strengthened
 piem modi ne desh kii arthvyavastha ko 5 trillian dollar tak pahunchane kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 According to experts, for this it is necessary that the annual growth rate in GDP will be continuously around 9 percent for many years
 itani tej badhat kaarobaar or udyog jagat main majbootee or unke sahyog ke bina nahin ho sakati
 On the target of an economy of $ 5 trillion, PM Modi said, "if the 130 crore countrymen go about small things, then the economy of $ 5 trillion is not difficult
 paanch saal ke bheetar 2 se 3 trillian dollar tak pahunch gaye
 If it does not happen in 70 years, then in 5 years, then in the coming 5 years, a $ 5 trillion economy can easily be built
 'unhone kaha ki jab raajnneetik sthirataa hoti he to duniya kaa bharosa banataa he
 Today the world is eager to do business with us
 mahangaai ko control karte hue ham vikaas dar ko badhaane vaale hai
 This balance is formed after a long time

 The BJP has also fielded maximum candidates from the upper castes, but it has taken extreme care
 jaise pune or nagpur se brahman ummidavaar to mumbai se jain, marwari or gujarati ko utaara gaya he
 Altogether 17 tickets have been given to upper castes

 On the other hand, the average salary of people who have got jobs is only Rs 7800 per month
 darasal, trinmul congress ke rajyasabha sadsy mo
 The data that the government has provided in response to their questions, which Nadeemul Haq sought from the government for training, placement and overseas employment etc
 under 'skill India', is shocking
 kaushal vikaas or udhyamshiltaa rajya mantri aarake singh ne jo data uplabdh karaayaa he, uske mutabik pradhanmantri kaushal vikaas yojana (PMKVY) ke antargat 11 november 2019 tak 38

 Bigg Boss is changing daily in his style
 contestant ke bich jhagade or pyaar ke bich sho kaa rukh rojaanaa badal rahaa he
 This week some contestants are angry over Himanshi Khurana's homelessness, which has seen a sudden change in their nature
 isamen pehla naam he aseem riyaj kaa
 After being homeless from home, Himanshi Khurana is also supporting Aseem Riyaz
 ek intervyuu ke dauraan unhone ghar main apana sabase acha dost shefali jarivaala or aseem riyaj ko bataaya he
 At the same time, now in an interview given to the Times of India, the show's makers have been accused of discriminating
 himanshi khurana ne kaha, 'aviction puri tarah pland tha
 Giving the Captain the right to nominate the Contestant and sending Paras Chhabra out of the middle for surgery raises questions
 sabko pataa he paras chhabda ko pichley hafte sabase kam vot mili the
 It looks completely planed and faked
 paras ke ghar se baahar jane ke baad voting lines kholi gai thim
 In the end, Bigg Boss gave the rights of aviction to the family, which is unfair
 ye darshakon kaa faisla nahin he
 "himanshi is missing Aseem? Himanshi said," It was totally discriminatory to act for me, i wouldn't feel bad if the audience had taken my name
 mujhe andaja lag gaya tha ki is baar main hi baahar jaaungi kyonki jaise chijen ho rahi thi wo bilkul alag thim
 Rather it was already fixed
 siddharth ko nomination kaa adhikaar dena, paras ko baahar bhejnaa
 We were framed in many ways so that one of us would go
 'himanshi ne sho mekars par siddharth shukla ko fevar karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya he
 There have been many times when their anger has not been shown, while others have been reprimanded for trivial matters
 aseem par bolte hue himanshi khurana ne kaha, 'bahut kam samay main meri aseem se acchhee dosti ho gai or ye bina kisi chal kii dosti thi
 Aseem Riyaz did a lot for me, he took care of me when i was not well
 hamane ek-duusare kaa stand bhi liya

 ' aatankwaadi hamale ke ek hafte baad 3 disambar ko shaam 6
 At 50 pm, two bags of 8 kg explosive RDX were found on the platform number 15 of Mumbai's crowded railway station Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST)
 yah ardex aise thile main rakhe gaye the jaise aatankwaadi apane peeth par laade hue the or ye unke hamale ke shikaar hue yatriyon ke saamaan ke saath terminus ke ek kone main rakhe the
 The city is stunned and relied on by police who are expected to remain alert
 aapane sochaa hoga ki siasti par hamale ke baad police ne saboot ke liye chappe-chappe ko chaan liya hoga or soonghney vaale kutton ko laga diya hoga or saare saamaan kii jaanch kar lee gai hogi
 But one week later explosives were recovered at CST
 maano bharat kaa sabase bheeshan aatankwaadi hamalaa abhi hua nahin he
 This negligence, and the inability to take action by sensing the situation, gave the terrorists a chance to carry out their conspiracy which is being described as 9 / 11 of India
 is hamale main 173 logon kii maut ho gai or 288 log ghayal ho gaye
 The basic strategy of tackling terrorism - who can do what, where, when, why and how - can become a victim of politics

 His talk may also apply to the 26 / 11 Mumbai terror attacks

 The Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), in at least six intelligence reports from September to November 19, had suspected a fidayeen attack by sea route
 unamem baar-baar kaha gaya tha ki taj hotel or siasti stesan par hamale ho sakate hai
 Despite this, the terrorists came by sea route comfortably, landed on the unimpeded coast and wreaked havoc across the city
 jaisaa ki hota aayaa he, rajya sarkaar ne kaha ki use koi chetavanee nahin mili or centre sarkaar jor detii rahi ki usne rajya ko cheta diya tha
 In line with Indian tradition, everyone is responsible here but no one is accountable

 As if the city was waiting for this attack
 misaal ke taur par tat par teen agenciyaan gasht lagaati hai-samudr main nausena, tatarakshak dal or marine petrol
 The Navy overpowered it by saying that it monitors remote areas of the sea
 tatarakshak dal ne paryaapt karmchaaree or upkaran na hone kaa bahaanaa banaaya
 After all, there are 5,000 trawlers in this area and it is impossible to check them all
 iske alaava, aatankwaadi aise ilaake main utre jisaki nigaraanee marine police karti he
 Under the Marine Fishing Regulation Act (MFRA), which came into force from 1993-94, the Center can provide 100 per cent assistance for the purchase of patrol boats and communication equipment of the State Governments
 lekin rajya sarkarein is yojana ko lagu karne main vifal rahi hai
 According to the Auditor General and Comptroller (CAG), Maharashtra did not complete the maintenance work and did not make full use of the money
 aap maane yaa na maane, police ke paas maharashtra ke 760 kimi samudr taton kii nigaraanee ke liye maatr paanch naukaaen hai, jinamein se do kharaab hai
 To assess the shameful negligence of the administration, consider this fact - the terrorists could have attacked the Bhabha nuclear research center or naval bases or oil refineries on the west coast if they had traveled a few miles further
 iske nateezon kii bas kalpana hi kii ja sakati he
 The capacity at the main site is no better

 By the time they returned, the terrorists had killed 58 people and Shinde was martyred

 The state government did not lack advice
 deshmukh ne pichley mangalvaar ko hi rajya ko salaah dene ke liye maharashtra suraksha parishad ke gathan kii ghoshnaa kii thi

 Worse, his suggestions — which included increasing surveillance of coastal areas and adding the Koli community to it — were largely ignored

 The state should have immediately placed a demand for the NSG in response to Zutshi and other hostages trapped in hotels

 Many people could be saved in such an hour

 Although the NSG itself did a good job, questions are raised about putting 50 hours to clean the Taj
 haa, unke paas taj kaa nakshaa nahin tha or ve andaaje se karrwai kar rahe the jabaki aatankwaadi taj ke kone-kone se waakif lag rahe the
 And yes, the NSG did not receive urban guerrilla warfare training
 lekin aatankwaad virdohi visheshgy poochhate hai ki use itnaa vakt kaise lag gaya? is abhiyaan main gas kaa istemaal kyon nahin kiya gaya? oparation blike thunder main enesji ne aatankwaadiyon ko jala kar raakh karne ke liye yelo phosphorus kaa istemaal kiya tha
 But the reason for not doing so in Mumbai was not given
 yah akshamya he ki is ilit force ke paas bhi upkarnon kaa abhaav he
 Forget top class facilities like uavs or Mobile Command Post, the commandos took out the terrorists without the basic equipment
 dilli se ravaanaa hone se chand minute pehle tak blike cat hawaondde par belistic jacket mangane ke liye besabri se phone kiye ja rahe the
 This crisis became serious due to failure of leadership and collapse of the system
 misaal ke taur par haalanki trident hotel ko saaf kar diya gaya tha lekin bandhakon ko 28 november tak baahar nahin nikaala ja sakaa, jabaki police ayukta hasan gafoor ko hotel ke baahar hi tainaat kiya gaya tha
 Even the basic system of information was absent
 pareshaan rishtedaaron kii madad karne ke liye koi vyavastha nahin thi
 There was no one to tell them who was killed, injured or taken hostage
 aise main afvaahon kaa bazaar garam tha
 Police did not know how many terrorists had entered the city
 pehle unhone kaha ki 12 aatankwaadi ghuse hai, phir deshmukh or patil ne unki sankhya ''kareeb 25'' bataai or antat 10 ke bare main pataa chalaa
 But the doubt remains
 kya or bhi aatankwaadi the? kya ve hotel main ghuse yaa vahiin kaam kar rahe the? ve 50 ghante tak kaise tik paae? kya unhone hathiyaar or gole pehle hi rakh die the? viley parley or badi bandar ke visphot ab bhi rahasy bane hue hai
 Who caused those explosions? Was the airport also on target? 700 people were evicted from the hotels without checking them
 kya unamem kuch aatankwaadi bhi batch nikle? kya ve shahar main maujuud hai? mumbai or deshvasi aane vaale dinon main in sawaalon ke jawaab chahenge
 As the crisis dragged on Friday night, Patil asked Rai if the Mumbai Police could join shoulder with the NSG in cleaning the Taj
 gafoor ne manaa kar diya
 They said that they are not trained for this campaign and they do not have equipment
 ausat pulisavaale saal bhar bandobast duty karte rahe hai or training range main paanch goliyon se kam daagate hai (jabaki koi bhi commando force kaa jawan kam-se-kam 150 goliyaan daagta he)
 They were not capable in any way

 New Delhi: a thought series 'dariyaganj Ki Kitabi Sham' has been launched by Vani Prakashan to warm the thoughts of the forgotten literary evenings of 'dariaganj', the largest and oldest bookshop of South Asia
 yah aayojan vimarsh kii ooshmaa ke saath garm chaay kii chuskiyaan, kagaz kii khushboo or puraani dilli ke khaas paaramparik flevar ko lekhakon, pathakon, sahitya rasikon ke man main phir se jinda karne kii niyat se pichley kuch samay se yojit kiya ja rahaa he
 This time in the fourth episode of 'dariyaganj Ki Kitabi Sham' series, journalist Saba Naqvi's book 'the political side of saffron: From Vajpayee to Modi' was discussed, in which young creator Luv Kanoi communicated with Saba Naqvi
 gyaat ho ki sabaa naqvi kii bahucharchit angrezi pustak 'shades of saifaran: vaajapeyi tu modi' kaa hindi anuwaad 'bhagava kaa raajnneetik paksh: vaajapeyi se modi tak' isi saal may maheene main vaani prakaashan se chapa he
 The discussion began with Love Kanoi questioning the creation process of his book with Saba Naqvi, in response to which Saba said that this book was not journalism
 commershili yah meri sabase mahatvapurn pustak he
 An agent followed me and got this book written
 jab main ise likhane lagi to hue smritiyon main jate hue mazaa aane laga
 Saba said that whenever i see my written report today, it would be comforting that i write well
 main apni kitaab ko hindi jagat main itani kubsuurati ke saath prastut kiye jane ke liye vaani prakaashan kii shukraguzaar hum
 i am really happy that this book will reach the Hindi readers
 bhashaa or anuwaad se jude sawaal par bhi sabaa ne bewak jawaab die
 Saba Naqvi said that there are some words and expressions that are difficult to translate, including many Hindi idioms
 isi tarah atal bihari vaajapeyi kii kuubasurat bhashaa kaa anuwaad nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Narendra Modi's Hindi is different
 lav ne seculirism par sabaa ke ek artical kaa hawala dete hue poocha ki kya is kitaab ke hindi main aane par dharmanirpekshata jaise muddon yaa deshaj bhashaa par baat hogi? ke jawaab main sabaa kaa kahana tha ki nayaa bharat ab in muddon or deshaj shabdon ko apni bhashaa or jeevanstyli main jagah degaa
 Saba Naqvi also shared his experiences about the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress during this period
 unka kahana tha ki aaj bhaajapa kii prakruti khud ko band kar rakhane kii he, par pehle aisa nahin tha
 There was an open dialogue, it was a different phase, the editors i worked with were at liberty, but now things have changed so i am happy in my columnist role
 sabaa ne chintaa jaahir kii ki aaj sarkaar se aam janata ko suchanaaen milani band ho gai hai
 To say that journalists can still go inside the headquarters of this party with a special card, but the question is that who will meet them there? The nature of the BJP has already changed
 pehle ke azaad khyaal or buddhijivi netaa vaajapeyi, arun jetali, jaswant singh aadi ab vah nahin hai or protocol badal gaya he
 Journalist Sanjay Kabir questioned Saba Naqvi about the role of social media, to which he replied that the BJP is very active on social media with its theoretical code
 is maamle main uskaa muqabla nahin ho saktaa
 Journalist Hansraj asked whether the information was not coming properly now? In response to this, Saba Naqvi said that now have you seen any exclusive news
 congress ek kamazor or sanghathanaatmak rup se bahut durbal party he
 There is also a lot of familism

 Similarly, the people became rich and the party paupers
 par bhaajapa sanghathan ke taur par bahut majboot he
 Saba Naqvi expressed regret saying that individualism has come in the BJP as well
 unhone kaha ki main kabhi kaha karti thi ki congress getkiper kii party he, par ab aisa hi kuch bhaajapa ke saath ho rahaa
 By the way, it is a matter of praise that the BJP has formed the best coalition government
 usne mamata, nitish jaison netaaon ke liye training skool kii tarah bhi kaam kiya he
 According to Saba, there is no right participation of women in BJP

 On the other hand, the Control and Auditor General of India (CAG) had said that Air India was actually 321 rather than operating profit in the last financial year
 4 karod rupee kaa parichaalan ghaataa hua
 The airline had earlier reported operating profit during the year
 kaig ne haalanki, yah spasht kiya ki isamen aankadon kaa koi herpher nahin hua he balki airline ne jo aankade report kiye hai vah vastav main ‘ghate ko kam karke bataaya gaya he
 ' aksar jab mujhe samaj nahin aata ki siyasat par kya likhuun yaa phir kaise likhuun, to main apane lambey samay tak sahyogi rahe divangat rajani kothaari se kalpana main batakahi karne lagata hum
 He was a sharp political scientist
 shandaar shrota the
 They could listen for hours and do so, taking notes on the back of an envelope
 isse bhi shandaar baat yah he ki rajani anokhe suzav dete the
 Once he said to me, "don't listen to the experts
" visheshgy sambhaavnaaon kaa master hota he
 Go out and gossip with people
 isse tumhaari vichaar prakriya shuru hogi
 Keep in mind, it is good with you that you are not a political scientist
 "rahul par likhane ke liye jab mujhase kaha gaya, to maine rajani kii salaah par amal kiya
 Rahul awakens the possibility, but also creates confusion
 maine hindustan times leadership summit kii unki ek tasviir dekhi, jisamen aise dikh rahe hai, maano kahin kho gaye hai
 He is completely opposite to Modi
 
 
 saubhaahgya se meri mulaakaat ek puraani mitra se hui jo kalakaar hai, unhone mujhe ek nai drushti di
 i told him that Rahul resembled Pinocchio (a fictional comic character), whose nose has not developed
 meri mitra hans padi or kaha ki tum puraani baat kar rahe ho
 "rahul," she insisted that the Archie Comics characters look
 milan kundera ke yaadgaar vaakyansh main halkaa chhedchhad karke kahen to ve jindagi ko halke main lene vaala jaisaa asahneeya bhav vyakt karte hai
 My friend Laugh and said that they certainly look like characters in the comic world, but that is why they are left from the difficult world of politics
 iske ulat aaj modi ko dekhie
 They look very rigid, exactly like the tough mannequins of the Tussauds Museum
 ve kisi ajeeb vigyaan ke avishkaarak kii tarah lagate hai, kisi jaadugar ke sahaayak kii tarah nirmam lagate hai, jabaki rahul jagahed or archi ke bich kii koi cheez
 They still look cute and morally immaculate
 cartoonon makh bhale hi ve bacchon ko baandhi jane vaali langot main najar aaen yaa phir baccha gaadi main, par ve pados ke kisi ladke kii tarah lagate hai
 Despite being above forty, he looks like an old man, while Modi looks at his age
 modi kii ''chaay par charchaa" kisi cameti kii baithak jaisi, kisi bemaja karmkand jaisi lagati he, lekin rahul ke bare main abhi bhi kayaas lagaaya ja saktaa he
 This is the magic of our comic book character
 ek anya mitra ne ek alag hi tarah kaa akalan kiya
 He said, Rahul Maggi sauce in Gujarat - tasted a bit different - and people got a different taste, although journalists could not tell anything
 ve kahin adhik sahaj or adhik sakasham dikhe
 My friend said that they have changed after moving to America
 hairaani hoti he ki pitroda unhen kahaan lekar gaye the
 It was as if he were brought up by a Zen master and he gave Rahul's creativity
 unhone kaha, ''ve antarmukhi hai
 If there is nothing inside you, then you cannot be a rifle shooter or akido master
 "ve muddon keprati gambhir or satark lagate hai, achche shrota hai, aamane-saamne kii baatcheet main sahaj lagate hai, haalanki saarvajanik manchon par ve achche vaktaa nahin hai
 There has also been a change in them that it seems that they prepare their speeches themselves and not repeat the words of an old Congressman like Digvijay Singh
 gujarat ke hi ek or puraane jaankaar kehete hai, ''aisa lagata he ki yuvaaon ko golband karne kaa vichaar unka apana he
 Together with the three young leaders, angry Patidar Hardik Patel and Alpesh Thakur, Rahul has changed the landscape of youth in politics, causing Modi to harp on the old raga and to prove Sonia and Rahul as non-hindus
 Have come " rahul sirf jati ko hi nahin jod rahe hai, balki iske saath mohabhang or sakriy yuvaaon ko ek saamaajik takat ke rup main jod rahe hai or jab ye yuva daawa karte hai ki vikaas kii chamak notebandi kii tarah feeki pad gai he, to modi kii shabdaawalee achaanak tang hone lagati he
 Rahul is also economizing
 ab lambey or neeras bhaashan nahin hote
 They speak bluntly and make good preparations with the Prime Minister on GST or demonetisation
 log kuch alag-sa ehsaas karte hai
 Even the press of Modi's yes can feel a different smell in the air
 iskaa koi vaigyanik aadhaar nahin he, na hi ise aankadon se dekha ja saktaa he, lekin bhaajapa kaa avamulyan dekha ja saktaa he
 i accept that these things are based on the environment, but sometimes the atmosphere gives an idea of the future
 ab rahul madhyamik str main lagate hai, cartoon jaise nahin, lekin ve abhi nayak bhi nahin bane hai
 They are like that new picture, which is slowly getting ready and the audience is waiting in anticipation
 ek tarah kii adarsh sthiti jarur he, lekin koi aakhir kab tak intjaar kar saktaa he
 The situation is fairly clear
 gujarat rahul ke liye diksha samaaroh jaisaa he or unhone anushthan thik se kiya he
 They are no longer uncertain, they have crossed the transition period
 gujarat ke baad ve aupchaarik rup se congress kii aguai karenge
 The ritual has its own arguments
 rahul ab anmane kishor nahin hai
 He is now a leader ceremonially
 anushthan achche se kiya jaae, to kisi vyakti main sankraman kaa bhav paidaa karata he or gujarat rahul ke liye aisa hi anushthan he
 The social change is remarkable
 rahul kaa vyaktitv or bhoomika badalati dikh rahi he or ab isamen parivartan or paravartan aasaan nahin hoga
 The old excesses and complaints, which the media has been making an issue, are no longer enough
 vastav main ab log aitihaasik congress kii ore nahin dekh rahe hai, balki aisi congress kii ore dekh rahe hai, jo itihaas banaae
 Rahul and the whole country are realizing that we are standing between two different stories
 pehla kathanak aitihaasik congress ke bare main he, nehru or indira kii vanshavaadi congress ke bare main
 But he is now a part of memory
 rahul kah rahe hai ki mujhe nai congress kaa khaakaa khinchne dijie, ve aantarik loktantr kii baat kar rahe hai, or santhnik badlaav ke anushthan kii baat kar rahe hai, jo unke dil ke bahut kareeb he
 Like the new generation of management experts, Rahul believes that small changes in the organization are the backbone of big changes
 koi samaj saktaa he ki yah puraani congress nahin hogi, balki team rahul hogi, jisamen unki tarah yuva netaa honge
 Such efforts should be experimental, with scope for mistakes, not flattery, nor should it be authoritarian
 congress kii puraani kentul kaam nahin aegi
 Rahul may not be the boss of his party, it is too early to say Jananeta, but he will be first among equal people, his role and importance is clear
 desh ko nai style kaa intjaar he, jo samuhik hogi or isliye ekarup bhi, ek parivaar jaisi lekin parivaar kii puraani simaaon se pare
 Being an observer one should not expect too much clarity initially
 yah milijuli congress hogi, taaki usase prem or nafrat, donon kii ja sake
 There should not be a congress that starts collecting commemorative postage stamps
 ham ab kataaksh kar sakate hai ki rajkumaar alavida, ab netaa aayaa
 Understand one thing that it is not that everything went well in the Congress party
 balki ek party ke rup main bhaajapa main achaanak chijen galat hone lageen or puraani congress kii tarah vah unhen sweekaar bhi nahin kar rahi he
 The party has made a huge mess - scandal, demonetisation of agriculture sector, while farmers have been in bad condition due to suicides and drought

 He raised doubts in his statement that his state is an integral part of India

 Omar also questioned the bjp's perspective
 bhaajapa kahati rahi he ki jammu-kashmir ke sandarbh main ab koi vivaad sulajhane ko bachaa hi nahin he
 In Omar's opinion, if this were to happen then what was the need of the Simla agreement, the Lahore manifesto and then the talks in Agra and Delhi? His comments led to marshals to overcome the resentment arising among the opposition legislators

 aap ko yah jaanakar hairaani hogi ki baba vaidyanath kii nagari devgarh ke log 1945-46 se computer se rou-ba-rou hai or yahaan kaa bhu-nibandhan vibhaag is dauraan hi computerikrut ho gaya tha
 Such strange revelations have been taking place since the issue of illegal purchase and sale of land in Deoghar district has been going on for the last 12 years
 bataaya gaya he ki bhu-mafia ne prashasan kii mileebhagat se takreeban 771
 Sold 59 acres of non-salable land while selling it under the Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act is strictly prohibited
 prashasan ke khud ke anumaan ke mutabik ghotaale kii rakam 1,000 karod ru
 Is close to in 12 saal main devgarh main 12 upayukta, 11 espi, 14 apper upayukta, 11 disielaar tainaat hue lekin kisi kii bhi najar is ghotaale kii ore nahin gai
 However, the present Deputy Commissioner of Deoghar (DC) Mast Ram Meena, who disclosed the scam, in a confidential letter to the government, recommended the investigation of this entire matter to the Monitoring Department and said that without administrative help such scam Cannot be executed
 lekin jharkhand ke mukhyamantri arjuna munda ne is puure maamle kii sibiai jaanch kii sifarish kar di he
 He said, "this is a big scam and the involvement of the inter-state gang cannot be denied
" ''philhal police ne fori karrwai karte hue devgarh abhilekhaagaar main karmchaaree sunil poddar or jameen ke ek kaarobaari dhruv parihast ko giraftaar kar jail bhej diya he
 Police is also looking for another land trader Sanjay Singh
 mafia ke dussahas ko aise bhi samajha ja saktaa he ki jab pichley maheene disi ne in maamalon se jude jameen ke saare dastavejon ko trunk main daal kar silband karvaa diya to bhu-mafia ne in saare jabt dastavejon ko chori chupake 1 sitambar kii raat aag ke hawaale kar diya
 Now the truth is coming out, it is learned that Madhupur and Mohanpur regions including Deoghar region were the biggest focal point of the scam
 is ghotaale ko jis tarah anjaam diya gaya vah bhi kam dilachasp nahin he
 The old and original maps of the respective land were replaced with computerized maps and the date of change is 1945–46 years when the computer had no sign-up at that time
 misaal ke taur par devgarh ke mauja madhusudan kii 3
 a computerized map of the 27-acre fallow non-mazrua land, which falls into the non-salable category, has been published
 mul dastavej ko gaayab karte hue nakli dastavej laga die gaye
 The revenue employee made the sale salable by showing 35 years of revenue collection through receipt number 607947, 2009
 jaanch se pataa chalaa he ki index-2 main vyapak tareeke se chhedchhad kar gaiyr bikri yogya jameen ke kagajaat badal die gaye
 At some places, the land mafia changed the entire details of the land
 aisa nahin he ki in varshon main padaadhikariyon ko in gadabadiyon kii koi jaankaree nahin rahi
 Where only 10 per cent of the land in Deoghar falls in the salable category, the upsurge in land sales in the last 10 years creates doubt in itself

 But if the state government were to act strictly, then today the thing would have been different

 Deoghar's Panda society is deeply hurt and angry by this scandal

 jiske baad akhbaar ko apni galat ko sweekaar karte hue sahi ko prakashit karne kaa aadesh diya gaya he
 The EPFO also thanked the Press Council of India for the correct inquiry and for giving a strong message to the newspaper
 darasal pichley saal agast main times of india (toi) ne kendriya shram mantri bandaaru dattatreya ke saath kaam kar rahe shyaam vir taank par kathith bhrashtachar maamle ko lekar ek khabar prakashit kiya tha, jisamen shyaam vir taank par karmchaaree bhavishya nidhi sanghathan (ipiefo) main ghoose dene kaa zikr kiya gaya tha
 However, at the same time the news was published and wrote a letter to EPFO networks of India and denied the allegations
 khat main shyaam vir taank par lage aaropon ko puri tareeke se galat bataaya gaya tha
 This letter was written by an officer posted in the post of Regional PF Commissioner at Rohtak EPFO office, Haryana
 'times of india' main prakashit khabar ke tathy'times of india' kii khabaron ke mutabik kendriya mantri bandaaru dattatreya ke saath kaam rahe shyaam vir taank par sibiti (central board of trustee) evam ipiefo ke adhikariyon ko rishwat dene ke aarope lage the, jiske baad unhen aanan-fanan main pad se hataa diya gaya
 Shyam Veer was also accused of altering files
 jaankaree ke anusaar riginal provident funds kamishnar rank ke adhikari taank ne RPFC-II cader ke adhikariyon ke vetanman main badhotaree ke liye sibiti or ipiefo ke adhikariyon ko baari rishwat di thi
 First of all the aspects related to this news (aajtak
 in) ne prakashit kiya tha
 Accused of bribing the officer working with Bandaru Datatreya, the EPFO denied the EPFO had written to the newspaper, denying the news in the 'times of India'
 ipievoka kahana tha ki akhbaar ko sahi fact ko saamne nahin laayaa
 The EPFO had said that the accusation of paying CBT and EPFO officials a bribe was totally baseless
 jiske baad ipiefo ne is maamle ko lekar press council of india kaa darwaja khatkhataya
 The newspaper had given a question about the cleanliness, after the newspaper had put its side in the cleanliness
 lekin EPFO ke adhikari safai se santusht nahin the
 The newspaper, while referring to a conversation with Shyam Veer, wrote in a clean manner that the allegations against Shyam Veer are false, he has refused to bribe in any way
 haalanki akhbaar ne sidhe taur par apni galati nahin maani
 The argument of EPFO, in a letter written by EPFO to 'times of India', says that now all pfs are paid online by EPFO, then there is no basis for such news

 kapil sharma is samay desh ke number ek kamedian bane hue hai

 iske baad kapil soni channel par 'da kapil sharma sho' lekar aae or colors par unke is sho kii jagah krishna abhishek kaa 'kamedi nits bachaao' shuru hua tha

 Krishna has now expressed his desire to work with Kapil
 unhone yah bhi kaha he ki unki or kapil kii jodi shahrukh khan or salmaan khan kii jodi kii tarah hogi
 Let us tell you that in one of his interviews a year ago, Krishna Abhishek also said that cold war is going on between him and Kapil and both of them are no longer friends
 unhone kaha tha ki un donon ke bich kisi prakaar kaa sammaan nahin bachaa he
 Talking to news agency PTI about working with Kapil, Krishna said, "yes definitely, people are waiting to see the two of us together on one stage
 mujhe lagata he ki yah shahrukh or salmaan ke ek saath ek film main kaam karne jaisaa hoga
 it will be very fun
 aisa samay jarur aayega
 "describing Kapil as number one in comedy, Krishna said that he can give him a tough challenge in acting
 tippaniyan After Kapil Sharma closed his show on Colors, Krishna criticized his decision in several interviews
 vahiin kapil ne sidhe taur par krishna abhishek ko lekar kabhi kuch nahin kaha, lekin unke sho ko lekar unhone kai baar mazaakia tippanee jarur kii he
 Krishna's show went off air in January this year due to dwindling trps and his show was replaced by Neha Dhupia and Sohail Khan's kids comedy show Chhote Mian

 At the same time, BJP national president Amit Shah also got new strength
 north east main pehali baar bijepi kii sarkaar bananaa party ke hit ke liye kai myanon main mahatvapurn isliye bhi he kyonki pashchim bengal, kerala or tamilnadu ke chunaavon main jis dhang se party kaa vot pratishat badha he, use amit shah 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye phaayde kii drushti se mahatvapurn maan rahe hai
 After the defeat of those who questioned Amit Shah in Delhi and Bihar, many questions were raised on Amit Shah's leadership and strategy, but now the results of these five states have served as a tonic for the BJP as well
 It has also worked to lock the mouths of people who question the image of a strong party president of Amit Shah
 amit shah ne in panchan rajyon ke parinaamon se utsahit hokar 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavo kaa agenda bhi tay kar diya he
 Amit Shah believes that the NDA will form the government again in 2019, moving towards the Congress-free India
 unhen vishwaas he ki jis tarah se kerala, tamilnadu or pashchim bengal chunaavon main bijepi kaa vot pratishat badha he, 2019 tak sanghathan main or vistaar kar is vot pratishat main zyada se zyada badhotaree karke in rajyon se zyada se zyada loksabhaa seat jiti jaaen
 Amit Shah, who became Modi's man of the match, has always been considered a good strategist in terms of elections and organization
 piem modi ne bhi shah kii is khubi kii vajah se unhen party adhyaksh banwaaya tha
 Amit Shah was in charge of UP in the 2014 elections and the party won 71 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in NUP
 chunaav nateezon ke baad modi ne khud amit shah ko 'man of the Match' kaha tha
 Soon after the 2014 elections, Amit Shah had won 4 major BJP victories in the assembly elections in Haryana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir after becoming the Speaker
 dilli or bihar main haar ke baad bijepi ke varisht netaaon ne amit shah kii leadership par sawaal khadey kiye the lekin aaj unheen varisht netao main se ek murali manhor joshi ne assam kii jeet ke baad amit shah kii tarif karne main tanik bhi der nahin kii
 It is clear that looking at the changed atmosphere for the party with the election results of the government and 4 states in Assam, Amit Shah is the King of the Party

 'shoonyakaal main yah mudda basapa ke satish chandra mishra ne uthaaya tha
 He had said that the Uttar Pradesh government's decision to include 17 communities belonging to Other Backward Classes in the Scheduled Castes list is unconstitutional as only the Parliament has the right to change the lists of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes
 gahalot ne kaha ki kisi bhi samudaay ko ek varg se hataa kar duusare varg main shaamil karne kaa adhikaar keval sansad ko he
 He said, "earlier similar proposals were sent to Parliament but the consensus could not be reached
 'unhone kaha tha ki rajya sarkaar ko samuchit prakriya kaa paalan karnaa chahie anyathaa aise kadamon se maamla adaalat main pahunch saktaa he
 Satish Chandra Mishra said that as per sub-section (2) of Article 341 of the Constitution, the list of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes can be changed only with the approval of Parliament

 ’ Indian cricketer Gautam Gambhir has responded to critics saying that his and Virender Sehwag's pair of runs at an average of 53 is still the best opening pair in the country
 aalochakon ne haal kii kharaab form ko dekhte hue is salaami jodi ke bhavishya par andeh jataayaa tha
 "our average as an opening pair is still 53, which i think is one of the best as an opener in world cricket," Gambhir said
 itane lambey samay tak khilne vaali zyada salaami jodiyaan nahin hai, jinka prayek pari main 53 kaa ausat ho
 If the average of 53 is not enough, then i do not know what is enough
 unhone kaha, salaami jodi ke rup main aap prayek pari main 50 kaa ausat banaate ho or agar aap prayek pari main 50 ran se shuruyaat kara rahe ho, to aap isse zyada nahin kar sakate
 i would suggest them to look at the figures
 53 kaa ausat shandaar he
 In the past, many salute joints have not been able to make such an average and are still not making it today
 sahvaag ne pichley do saal main keval ek hi shatak jadaa he or 37
 His career average in Tests is 26, which is 26 runs scored
 64 se kaaphi neeche he
 Gambhir has not scored a single hundred in the same time and he averaged 44 in his career
 35 ran kii tulana main keval 30
 Has scored at an average of 31
 tippaniyan When asked if he was under pressure from not being able to score a Test century since last year, he said, "it's not about playing 100 innings every time, but when you start batting
" Doing, it's about how much you're contributing
 aisa nahin he ki sirf maine hi shatak nahin banaaya he, aise kai anya khilaadi hai, jinhone saikadaa nahin jadaa he
 Gambhir said, people only discuss about the century, i don't know why
 maine dakshin africa main 93 ran banaae the
 Had scored close to 85 runs in Australia
 gambhir ne janvari, 2010 main bangladesh ke khilaaf antim shatak jamaaya tha
 He said, when you start the innings, it is seen how much you contribute
 gambhir ne kaha, salaami jodi ke taur par hamaara ausat ab bhi 53 kaa he, jo mujhe lagata he ki vishwa cricket main salaami ballebaaji ke taur par sarvshereshth main se ek he
 There are not many opening pairs playing for such a long time, which average 53 in each innings
 agar 53 kaa ausat hi kaaphi nahin he, to main nahin jaanata ki kya kaaphi he
 "as an opening pair you make an average of 50 in each innings and if you are starting with 50 runs in each innings, you cannot do more than that
 main unhen aankade dekhne kaa suzav duungaa
 The average of 53 is fantastic
 beete samay main kaaphi salaami jodiyaan itnaa ausat nahin bana saki hai or aaj bhi nahin bana rahi hai
 Sehwag has scored only one century and 37 in the last two years
 26 ausat se ran banaae hai, jo test main unke kariyar ke ausat 50
 Well below 64
 gambhir ne bhi itane hi samay main ek bhi saikadaa nahin jadaa he or unhone apane kariyar ke ausat 44
 Only 30 compared to 35 runs
 31 ke ausat se ran banaae hai
 The comments jab unase poocha gaya ki kya vah pichley saal se test shatak nahin bana paane se dabaav main hai, to unhone kaha, yah (pari kaa aagaaj karnaa) har baar 100 ran kii pari khilne ke bare main nahin he, balki jab aap ballebaaji main aagaaj kar rahe hai, to aap kitna yogadan kar rahe hai, is bare main he
 It is not that i have not scored a century, there are many other players who have not scored a hundred
 gambhir ne kaha, log sirf shatak ke bare main charchaa karte hai, main nahin jaanata ki aisa kyon he
 i scored 93 in South Africa
 australia main 85 ke kareeb ran jutaaye the
 Gambhir scored his last century against Bangladesh in January 2010
 unhone kaha, jab aap pari shuru karte hai, to aap kitna yogadan karte hai, yah dekha jaataa he

 He went to Agra to study Arabic and then traveled to Lahore to study Persian
 us jamaane main padhai ke liye itane shaharon kii yatra karne vaale vah virale vyakti the
 His knack of study and knowledge made him a researcher and wanderer
 unhone vishwa ke anek deshon kii yatra kii or khub padhaa-likhaa
 Due to this wandering, Mahapandit became well-versed in Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Tamil, Kannada, Pali, English, Japanese, Russian, Tibetan and French languages
 kehete hai inke atirikt bhi unhen 20-25 bhashaaon kaa gyaan tha
 According to some critics, the great traveller-wise Rahul Sankrityayan was a scholar of 36 languages
 par apni vidwata ke bich bhi maatrubhaasha hindi ke prati unke man main agaadh shraddha thi
 He was influenced by Arya Samaj, Marxism and Buddhism by this nomadism and reached Russia in the year 1917 during the Russian Revolution
 vahaan roosi kranti ke kaarnon kaa gahan adhyayan kar unhone ek pustak likhi
 Similarly, to study Buddhism, he made a painful trip to China, Japan, Sri Lanka and Tibet etc
 and for a long time migrated to remote areas of these countries
 kaha jaataa he ki in deshon main unhen jo bhi pracheen pustaken evam pandulipiyaan milin, unhen vah sahejte gaye, or jab tibet se bharat laute to apane saath 22 khachcharon par ladakar ye granth bhi le aae
 He translated most of these into Hindi
 is adhyayan ke dauraan vah buddha dharm se itane prabhavit hue ki usesso keval apanaaya, balki apana naam bhi rahul sankrutyaayan rakh liya

 1927-28 tak srilanka main unhone sanskrit shikshan kaa kaary kiya
 Despite being a good writer and thinker, he never turned away from the direct movement
 kisaan unhen itane priy the ki jab bhi vah swadesh main hote kisaan andolan main bhaag lenaa na bhoolatey
 However, in 1931, he went on a trip to Europe with a Buddhist mission
 isi tarah rus par unke kiye gaye gahan adhyayan ke chalate saal 1937 main jab unhen moscow main pracheen sahitya ke adhyayan ke liye bulaayaa gaya, to vah vahaan bhi gaye, par 1942 main angrejon ke khilaaf mahatma gandhi dwaara chede gaye 'bharat chodo andolan' main shaamil hone ke liye vah swadesh laut aae or jail chale gaye

 How Rahul Sankrityayan brought books from the Soviet Union to India for the creation of the famous book 'history of Central Asia' will also have to understand the indomitable spirit behind his creation process
 volga se ganga likhane se pehle rahul sankrutyaayan ne bharat ke 8 hajaar varshon ke itihaas ko apni ankhon se dekha, phir duniya ke samaksh prastut kiya

 According to Stenkelner, Rahul Sankrityayan's position in research institutes outside India is not possible for any Indian politician
 rahul sankrutyaayan kaa hriday bahut bada tha
 He used to emphasize on seeing qualities rather than defects in a person
 unka mat tha ki koi bhi vyakti doodh kaa dhulaa nahin hota
 If any person has even five percent goodness, then he should give importance
 ghumkkad panth ke mahaan samarthak sankrutyaayan 1959 main darshanashastra ke mahacharya ke naate ek baar phir srilanka gaye; par 1961 main unki smriti kho gai
