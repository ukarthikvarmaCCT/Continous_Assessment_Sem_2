 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle congress chhodkar bijepi main shaamil hone ke baad tom vadakkan (tom Vadakkan) kaa ek purana twit soshal media par viral ho rahaa he
 However, this Twitter handle is not verified
 magar ise tom vadakkan kaa bataaya jaataa he
 Through which they are now being trolled
 kuch patrkaar bhi is twit ko retweet kar rahe hai
 In fact, on February 3, he said in response to a tweet- Once you join the BJP, all your crimes are cleared
 ab sanyog dekhie, ek maheene baad vah khud bijepi main shaamil ho gaye hai
 In fact, a journalist had made a tweet after an altercation between the CBI and the Mamata Banerjee government in early February, saying that Mukul Roy of the Trinamool Congress, who was involved in the Saradha chit fund scam, is now in the BJP, but someone asks him a question not doing
 is twit kaa jawaab dete hue ek or patrkaar ne kaha- yahi kaaran he ki unhone bijepi kaa bachaav kiya
 Taking forward this sequence of tweet and retweet, Tom Vadakkan (then Congress leader) tweeted - Once you join BJP, all your crimes are cleared
 ab log unke is kathith puraane twit ko viral kar rahe hai
 The alleged old tweet of Tom Vadakkan joining BJP
 aapako bataa den ki tom vadakkan ((tom Vadakkan) ) ko sonia gandhi kaa kaaphi kareebi mana jaataa he
 Tom Vadakkan, who joined the BJP in the presence of Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad in Delhi, said that he was disturbed by the dynastic politics of the Congress and decided to leave the party after being convinced
 aapako bataa den ki do din pehle hi maharashtra main congress (congress) ko bada jhatka laga tha
 Congress leader Sujay Vikhe Patil joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday
 sujay maharashtra vidhansabha main netaa vipaksh radhakrishna vikhe patil ke bete hai or peshey se neurosrjan hai
 It is being told that he wanted to contest from Ahmednagar seat, but the Congress did not make him a candidate from there
 instent miseging ap watsap main bada badlaav ho rahaa he
 In August, we told you that the company has partnered with Google
 iske tahat google drive main watsap ke chats byaap difolt taur par diya jayega
 The company has also said that if the users have not refreshed their whatsapp chats backup on Google Drive till November 12, then their chat history can be deleted
 haalanki yah gambhir samasya nahin he, kyonki agar aap hameshaa byaap lete hai yaa phir chats aapke smartphone main hai to wo delit nahin honge
 Under the partnership with Google, keeping backups of whatsapp chats on Google Drive will not reduce the space given to you
 google drive parwotsapachats byaap rakhane kaa phayda ye he ki ise kisi bhi smartphone par aasaani se open kar sakate hai
 If you have taken a new phone or are using a new smartphone for whatsapp, then this feature will prove beneficial for you
 google drive par watsap kaa byaap lene ke liye apane smartphone google drive ko actevet kar len
 To make a backup, go to the main menu of whatsapp and tap on Settings
 yahaan chat kaa opshan hoga yahaan aap byaap tu google drive select kar sakate hai
 Here you will get the option of backup frequency which you can choose according to your choice
 jis acount main chats byaap seve karnaa he yahaan enter karen
 Users of the company are advised to connect the phone to wifi while backing up, as backup files differ in size and consume data, which can cost you extra data
 gauratlab he kiwotsapacat byaap system duusare chating ap se alag he
 Because whatsapp's chats and media are stored on the phone instead of being stored in a detached service
 isliye phone badalte samay watsap kaa data byaap lenaa jaruri hota he, isliye yugers ko google cloud kaa sahaara lenaa hota he
 Although the data of whatsapp in iphone is backed up on icloud, the free quota of people usually ends soon

 Team India's master-blaster Sachin Tendulkar may get the Bharat Ratna
 ek angreji akhbaar ke hawaale se mil rahi khabar ke anusaar sarkaar ne is bare main aade aa rahe niyamon ko badal diya he
 On the other hand, hockey star Major Dhyanchand is also reported to have been given the Bharat Ratna
 ab tak khilaadiyon ko desh kaa sabase bada sammaan bharat ratna nahin diya jaataa tha
 The Prime Minister's Office has taken this decision after the recommendation of the Sports Ministry and the Home Ministry
 grih mantralay ne july main is bare main pradhanmantri se sifarish kii thi
 The country's highest civilian honor Bharat Ratna was instituted in 1954
 tab se ab tak 41 logon ko isse nawaja ja chukaa he, lekin inamen se koi bhi khilaadi nahin he
 Actually, the reason is a rule attached to it
 niyamon ke mutabik bharat ratna kala, sahitya or vigyaan ke vikaas main asaadhaaran seva ke liye tathaa sarvocch str kii jan seva ke liye diya jaataa he
 There is no mention of sports in it
 jabaki padam puraskaron ke niyamon ke tahat yah puraskaar sabhi prakaar ke kshetron jaise ki kala, sahitya, shiksha, khel-kud, chikitsa, saamaajik kaary, vigyaan, ejiniyari, saarvajanik maamle, civil seva, vyapaar or udyog aadi main vishisht or asaadhaaran uplabdhiyon yaa sevaaon ke liye die jate hai
 This is the reason that Sachin has been awarded the 'padma Vibhushan' and the highest sports honor 'rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna' award under the rules, but Bharat Ratna is not yet in his account
 gauratlab he ki mahendra singh dhoni, harbhajan singh, yuvaraj singh or virendra sahvaag jaise maujuuda cricket khilaadiyon sahit kai purv cricketer sachin ko bharat ratna dene kii maang kar chuke hai
 The results of the Lok Sabha elections are going to come on 23 May, but before this there is a ruckus in the Indian stock market

 The Sensex closed at the level of 39031 on 30 April
 vahiin, yah 13 may ko 37090 ke str par band hua
 That is, there has been a fall of 1941 points in 9 days
 vahiin, is dauraan nifti bhi 11748 se tuutakar 11148 ke str par aa gaya

 share bazaar ke is bure halaat ke bich kul market cap 8
 56 lakh crore reduced by Rs
 144,52,518

 What is the downfall? Political instability: The biggest reason for decline in the stock market is political instability
 darasal, bhartiya loksabhaa ke chunaav parinaam 23 may ko aane vaale hai
 The situation is not clear about the election results
 raajnneeti ke panditon ko lagata he ki spasht bahumat kii sarkaar nahin banegi
 In such a situation, there is an atmosphere of fear among investors
 aankade bataate hai ki 3 maheene tak lagaataar nivesh karne ke baad may ke shuruaati 7 dinon main videshi niveshkon ne bazaar se 3207 karod rupee kii nikasi kar lee he
 Market experts say that this decline may continue even further

 In fact, business negotiations between the two countries have failed and tensions continue to rise every day due to the rhetoric of US President Donald Trump
 iskaa asar asian bazaaron par dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 From Japan's Nikkei to the Indian stock market has been affected
 nateeja yah hua he ki beete 9 kaarobaari din se sensex or nifti lagaataar laal nishaan par band ho rahe hai
 One reason for the decline of the companies' market is the results of the companies

 pradhanmantri dwaara itane bade package kii ghoshnaa ko lekar vah jo tippaniyan kar rahe hai, usase yah saaf vidit he
 It is clear that his demand for a special package for Bihar is just politics
 ’’ He also lashed out at Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for sharing the stage with Nitish and criticizing the Prime Minister, saying, "the Chief Minister of Delhi calls himself a warrior against corruption
" lekin kya vah yah bhul gaye ki bihar main kiskaa gathbandhan he
 Lalu Prasad is with Nitish and Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi are with Lalu
 sonia or rahul 2-ji par khamosh hai
 The comments bhaajapa netaa ne kaha, ‘‘mujhe khushi he ki kejariwal ji bihar jaaenge
 We will also hear what his views are on the alliance of Nitish, Lalu, Sonia and Rahul
 ’’ kejariwal ne kal yahaan ‘bihar diwas’ par nitish ke saath manch saajha karte hue bihar ke mukhyamantri ke liye ek or kaarykaal kii joardaar vakaalat kii thi
 Both had accused the Prime Minister of not fulfilling the promises made in the Lok Sabha elections 
 donon ne kaha tha ki dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dene or bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene ke liye ve mil kar sangharsh karenge
 Kejriwal also accepted Nitish's invitation to come to Bihar
 nitish ke saath manch saajha karne or pradhanmantri kii aalochana karne ke liye unhone dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko bhi aade haath lete hue kaha, ‘‘dilli ke mukhyamantri apane aap ko bhrashtachar ke khilaaf yoddha bataate hai
 But did he forget who has an alliance with Bihar? lalu prasad nitish ke saath hai or sonia gandhi tathaa rahul gandhi lalu ke saath hai
 Sonia and Rahul are silent on 2-G
 tippaniyan The BJP leader said, "I am happy that Kejriwal will go to Bihar
 ham bhi sunenge ki nitish, lalu, sonia or rahul ke gathbandhan par unke kya vichaar hai
 Kejriwal, while sharing the stage with Nitish on 'bihar Day' here yesterday, strongly advocated another term for the Chief Minister of Bihar
 donon ne pradhanmantri par aarope lagaaya tha ki unhone loksabhaa chunaav main kiye gaye vaayadon ko puraa nahin kiya he
 Both had said that they would fight together to give full state status to Delhi and special state status to Bihar
 bihar aane ke nitish ke nimantran ko bhi kejariwal ne sweekaar kiya

 Till about a decade ago, the youth used to express love to someone through love letters
 nae daur ke miseging ap ne ab lav letters ko jaise hameshaa ke liye ateet kii deevaaron main chunavaa diya ho
 It was the magic of 'pyaar Bhari Paati' that filmmakers put songs on the same theme in many films
 kai filmon ke tital isi par rakhe gaye
 Sequences of repeated love letter writing, tearing up, and passing it on to Dilruba and Jaanman were filmed in many films
 par ab yah kareeb-kareeb har taraf se nadaarad he
 The reality is also seen in films
 ab to mobile par beep-beep kii aawaaj ke jariye hi badi aasaani se 'ai lav you' ke massej bheje jate hai, whatsapp, vibar, hike jaise miseging ap ise or khushnuma ehsaas karaane ko taiyaar milte hai
 The new methods of ezhar-e-ishq are certainly convenient, but the old love letter used to be different
 kabhi letters ke bheetar gulab kii pankhudiyaan, kabhi rajnigandha kaa spray, kabhi pink color se dil kii akruti
 
 
 The means and ways of expressing love with each phase may have changed, but this love is immortal
 'likhe jo khat tuje', 'maine khat mehboob ke naam likhaa', 'pyaar ke kaagaj pe, dil kii kalam se' jaise geet aaj bhi yuva dilon kii dhadakanen badhaate hai

 On 6 May 2010, Kasab was sentenced to death by a lower court in Mumbai
 anya aaropon ke alaava kasaab ko desh ke khilaaf yuddh chhedane kaa bhi doshi tehraaya gaya he
 a division bench of Justice Aftab Alam and Justice CK Prasad reserved its verdict on the conclusion of the debates which lasted more than three months

 Senior advocate and amicus curiae Raju Ramachandran, appearing for Kasab, told the court that the denial of the right to have a lawyer at the initial stage of hearing and the right of protection against self-incrimination distorted the fair trial
 kasaab kaa bachaav karte hue ramchandran ne nyaayalay ko bataaya ki shuruyaat se hi yadi kasaab ko vakeelon kii madad mili hoti or uske baad yadi vah ikbaalia bayaan diya hota to kisi ko hairaani hoti

 team india ke captain kool em es dhonine test cricket ko alavida kah diya he or nae captain ke rup main viraat kohli unki jagah lenge
 Virat Kohli has already impressed everyone with his captaincy through the Adelaide Test, but he still has a lot to learn
 dhoni kii captaini main hi team india pehali baar test main best team bani
 While he led the team to some memorable victories, the team suffered some embarrassing losses under his leadership
 ab viraat unki jagah team kii kaman sanbhaalane ja rahe hai
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni's 20 special records in Test cricket: Five things Virat needs to learn from Dhoni: 1- Cool Temperament: Dhoni is not called Captain Cool
 match main kisi bhi sthiti ho dhoni bade hi kool andaaj main rahete hai
 No matter how much pressure there is, there is no wrinkle on Dhoni's face
 jeet ho, haar ho yaa match drow ho unke chehre ke haav bhav main zyada fark nahin hota he
 In this case, Virat Kohli needs to learn from him that no matter what the situation, the temperament should be cool, just like our Captain Cool
 2- experiment se dare nahin:dhoni ek aise captain rahe hai, jo kabhi bhi experiment karne se peeche nahin hate
 Many times the experiment was successful, many times he suffered the brunt but Dhoni did not back down from doing the experiment
 gendbaaji main badlaav ho, field placement ho yaa ballebaaji order main tabdili kerani ho dhoni kabhi bhi experiment se dare nahin
 This quality distinguishes him from the rest of the captains
 to viraat agar aapako bhi lambey samay tak team kii bagdor sanbhaalani he to experiment se peeche mat hatana
 3- Be an example for fellow players: Dhoni on the field or off-field, known as Mahima, has always respected fellow players
 sledging kaa jawaab dhoni ne kabhi sledging ne nahin diya balki apane balle se diya he
 This will be a very important lesson for Virat
 dhoni khud bhi aakraamak captain rahe hai lekin ati aakraamakata se bachate rahe hai
 In Virat Kohli's attitude, the aggressiveness is clearly visible
 captain team ke baaki khilaadiyon ke liye aaine jaisaa hota he or uskaa jaisaa aacharan hota he saathi khilaadi bhi vaisaa hi karte hai
 Aggression is not a bad thing but Virat will have to avoid excessive aggression, this can prove dangerous for Team India
 4- kisi se salaah lene main hichkichane kaa nahin:dhoni kii captaini kaa euaspy rahaa he ki wo kabhi bhi kisi bhi khilaadi se salaah lene main hichkichaae nahin
 Be it senior players like Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly and Anil Kumble or a junior player from Dhoni, he consulted everyone when needed
 viraat kohli ko bhi safal captain banane ke liye aisa karte rahanaa hoga
 5- Taking a stand for the team: Virat Kohli's poor form, or the jadeja-anderson feud in England, Dhoni did not disappoint when the players needed the support of Captain Cool
 media main baat karte hue dhoni hameshaa dhyaan rakhte rahe hai ki unhen kya bolnaa he or kya nahin
 Virat will have to learn this important lesson from Dhoni
 iske alaava dhoni kabhi haar ke liye bevajaah bahaanaa nahin banaate dikhe hai, wo bahut clear cat bolte hai
 If a bowler throws a few balls poorly, Dhoni used to go to him and encourage him and it is a big thing
 saathi khilaadiyon par dhoni ne hameshaa vishwaas kiya he
 Dhoni has also decided to retire because he has felt that Virat is ready for this responsibility
 patrkaar gauri lankesh hatyakand main ab police is baat kii tafteesh kar rahi he ki gauri kii hatya ke peeche kahin naksaliyon kaa haath to nahin he
 Actually, Gauri Lankesh had secretly entered the jungles of Bastar many times
 unke bhai indrajit lankesh ne bhi daawa kiya tha ki gauri ko naksali sanghathanon kii ore se dhamkee mili thi
 Gauri wanted to bring the notorious Naxalites into the mainstream
 yahi vajah he ki is maamle ko lekar chhattisgarh police bhi sakriya ho gai he
 According to Gauri's brother Inderjit Lankesh, Gauri Lankeshko also received threatening letters and emails from the Naxalites
 isliye chhattisgarh police gauri kii hatya ko lekar naksali conection talash kar rahi he
 It is being told that Gauri Lankesh visited the forests of Bastar more than four times in the year 2015 and 2016
 haalanki jangal main unki mulaakaat kab or kisase hui isaki adhikrut jaankaree police juta rahi he
 Gauri Lankesh visited Bastar for the atrocities on tribals and violations of human rights
 par bataaya to yah bhi jaataa he ki andhrapradesh or telugana ke sakriya naksaliyon se milane ke liye gauri lankesh khaastaur par bastar ke jangalon main daakhil hui thim
 He spent three to four days in the jungle in each tour
 haalanki gauri lankesh ne naksaliyon se mail mulaakaat ke baad sthaneey police or saamaajik kaaryakartaaon se dooriyaan banaae rakhi thim
 The reason why he did this is also being sought
 bastar ke police adheekshak aarif shaikh ke mutabik pichley 6 maah main gauri lankesh ke daure main bare main koi soochna nahin mili
 However, if they had come before this, then it would be investigated
 aarif shaikh ne sweekaar kiya ki media ke madhyam se gauri lankesh kencsli conekshanki suchanaaen police ko mili hai
 Which is being verified khabar he ki kai kukhyat naksaliyon ke aatmasamarpan ko lekar central cameti ne gauri lankesh se kai baar charchaa bhi kii thi
 Top Naxalite leaders feared that Gauri Lankesh not only instigated the cadre-based Naxalites to surrender but also created an atmosphere of surrender between the police and them
 jaankaron ke mutabik telugana rajya ke nirmaan ke baad aadha darjan se zyada kukhyat naksaliyon ke aatmasamarpan ko lekar naksaliyon kii central cameti gauri lankesh se naaraaz chal rahi thi
 Journalists in Chhattisgarh also suspect that the small action team of Naxalites did not carry out the incident
 philhal, maamle kii jaanch teji se chal rahi he

 According to a big newspaper, this controversy is about an election poster of MNS using the picture of bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi and it is written that 'voting MNS means to vote Narendra Modi'

 ab tak vidya charan shukla kaa safar shandaar dhang se chal rahaa tha
 But there was nothing in it, which had the shape of an unbroken streak in the date
 phir aayaa immergency kaa daur
 Indira was, but had gone more than her back
 manch par ghani kalmon, mote chashme or tikhi kashmiri naak vaale sanjay kaa padaarpan ho chukaa tha
 At the same speed as the air they claimed to run Maruti
 immergency ke shuruaati dinon main hi sanjay kotary kaa dhyaan soochna or prasaaran mantralay kii taraf gaya
 It was not going according to Sanjay's mood
 is par jab tab vipaksh kii khabaren bhi aa rahi thim
 Even more terrible was the fact that this ministry was unable to control the newspapers that were being printed under its nose
 aise main ek shaam indira se sanjay ne guftgu kii or paravaanaa nikal gaya
 The then minister Inder Kumar Gujral was sent as ambassador to Russia
 or ibi ministry kaa jimmaa mila vidyacharan shukla ko
 After that day Vidya did not miss any chance to show her loyalty
 har akhbaar prakaashan se pehle unke daftar jaataa tha or kaale rang ke gheron main rangakar waapas aata tha
 The situation had become such that the editors started fretting and leaving the editorial vacant
 iske baad vidya ne is chalan par bhi roak laga di
 Senior journalist Vinod Mehta has mentioned this in his book The Sanjay Story
 unke mutabik vidya sabase bade sampadak or ek shaks vaale sensor board ban gaye the
 At the same time, Amrit Nahata's film 'kissa Kursi Ka' was not only stopped from being released but all its prints were also destroyed
 baad main janata party kii sarkaar aane ke baad 1977 main ye film phir se relies hui
 Doordarshan's condition was that his entire staff everywhere was busy covering Sanjay Gandhi's tours
 tivi par har doosraa program, bees sutri kaarykram, parivaar niyojan or atikaraman hataane kii kavayad par kendrit ho gaya tha
 The issue does not stop here
 vidya kaa khauf dilli ke sampadakon ke paar jaakar mumbai main bhi parasane laga tha
 It is a famous story in political circles that Vidya asked singer Kishore Kumar, who lives in her home state of Madhya Pradesh, to sing at Sanjay Gandhi's meeting
 fakkad mizaaj ke kishor ne inkaar kar diya
 As a result, Kishore's voice rang out of the radio for the next two years
 dilli ke galiyaaron main ek or batakahi bahut mashhoor he
 According to this, Indira Gandhi was so happy with Vidya's work, that when the grounds and pavilions were ready for the 1982 Trade Fair in Delhi, she named it Pragati after Vidya's elder daughter
 aaj pragati maidan dilli kaa ek major landmark he, magar is kisse kii sachai kisi ko nahin pataa
 The grounds were named, but after Sanjay, who became a victim of acrobatics at Safdarjung Airport, Vidya's star also started to weaken
 rajeev gandhi ke satta main aate hi doon skool ke baba log siyasat kii shatranj par shah maat khel rahe the
 Old aristocracy could not solidify among them
 jab veepi singh mistar clin rajeev gandhi kii mukhaalafat kar congress se baahar hue, to peeche se vidya bhi nikal liye
 Vidya Charan Shukla sensed the wind's stance
 vah un kuch netaaon main the, jinhone jan morcha banaakar raja manda veepi singh ko kandhaa diya or itnaa upar uthaaya ki ve rajeev ke mukaable dikhne lagen
 Senior journalist Ram Bahadur Rai narrates an anecdote of those days
 bakaul raay mauka tha janamorcha netaaon ke chennai daure kaa
 The ambassador was all in the car
 aage driver ke bagal main vidyacharan shukla
 VP Singh and Rai himself
 patrkaar mahoday ne veepi singh se poocha ki ye daura or raily to thik hai, magar party kab banegi
 VP said something, before that Vidya's answer came
 abhi usamen kam se kam das maheene or lag jaaenge
 This one answer used to silence many questions
 pehla, morche main cheharaa bhale hi singh the, magar baikaroom stretidi vidya ke nirdesan main ban rahi thi
 Secondly, Vidya knew that to fight the election, it was not just the wind, but the party to ride on it
 is vaakye ke kul jamaa das maheene baad 11 oktober 1988 ko janata dal bana
 Then in 89, the slogan echoed, not the king is a fakir, the destiny of the country
 takadir fori taur par badali, rashtriya morcha or vam morcha kii sarkaar bani
 The BJP supported from outside and Vidya Charan Shukla returned to the cabinet
 isi dauraan kaa raay ek or kissa sunaate hai
 It happened that since Indira's time Vidya had got a bungalow in the President's Estate located behind Rashtrapati Bhavan
 sabase bada or bhavy bangala
 One day a meeting of Jan Morcha was held here
 isamen haryana ke khantee netaa devi laal bhi aae hue the
 When VP government was formed, Tau Devi Lal became Deputy Prime Minister
 unhone vidya se kaha ki mujhe tumhaara ghar bahut pasand he
 Vidya senses the gesture and empties the bungalow for Tau
 bakaul raay, vidya vyavhaar kushal the or jaanate the ki raajnneeti main aise jescher maukey par bahut kaam aate hai
 Within a year and a half, the air of politics changed again and Vidya realized it again in time
 janata dal kaa ek dhada adhyaksh ji, yani chandrashekhar ke netritv main tutaa or vidya unke saath ho liye
 Had to be given, then the post of minister was to be got
 1991 main rashtriya morcha bhaanumati ke kunbe kii taraf bikhar chuki thi
 Within a few years, Vidya returned to the Congress and soon became special to Narasimha Rao
 cabinet main entry phir hui
 But after going to Rao Raj, his stars also started getting angry
 kesari faqat koshadhyaksh the or peeche kii kursi par baithte the, jab vidya ne lagaataar satta sukh dekha tha
 In such a situation, Kesari became president, and Vidya was sidelined
 takhta palata or unki jagah sonia ain
 But Vidya could not return to the high command's kitchen cabinet
 2000 main madhyapradesh ke adivasee ilaakon ko alag kar chhattisgarh bana
 Mahasamund, the traditional seat of Vidya, used to come in this
 alag hue rajya ke vidhayak dal main congress bahumat main thi
 In such a situation, the CM was also to be his
 vidya ko laga ki unki baari aa gai he
 But the crown punished the head of bureaucrat-turned-politician Ajit Jogi
 yahi jogi kabhi raipur ke colector the or shukla ji ko yas sar yas sar kiya karte the
 But politics often teases the past
 vidya ko ye tajposhi nagavar gujri, unhone kasam kha lee, ki soobe main congress kii jaden khod deni hai
 Elections were held in 2003
 tab tak vidya congress chhod chuke the
 He joined Sharad Pawar's NCP
 rajya main vahi party ke survey sarva the
 He distributed tickets keeping Congress candidates in mind everywhere
 jab nateeja aayaa to shukla ke hisse sirf ek seat ai, magar congress ke hisse main unhone khub sari khiz de di
 In fact, due to NCP candidates, Congress lost 28 seats in the 90-member assembly
 tab muskuraate hue vidya ne kaha tha ki raajnneeti colector kii kalam se nahin chalati
 The gesture was clear
 magar iske baad phir shukla dhime dhime haashiye par jane lage
 The energy that was needed to build the NCP structure was not left in the end due to Omar
 kuch hi baras baad jab vaajapeyi kii sarkaar gai, to tay ho gaya ki vidya ke paas congress main lautne ke alaava koi chaara nahin
 But any such attempt was strongly opposed by Ajit Jogi
 phir bhi vidya party main laut aae
 Returned, but had nothing to do
 aise main unhone ekantavaas chun liya tha
 Lived in a flat in South Delhi
 kabhi kabhaar raipur jate the
 Here the election began, then many Congress Chhatrapas of Chhattisgarh sought his blessings and support
 vidya ko sakriy hone ke liye aisi hi kisi sanjivani kaa intjaar tha
 He became active again by defying age
 parivartan yatra ke dauraan unka utsaah dekhte hi banataa tha
 Then came the day of 25 May
 vahi jangal tha or safari kaa feel detii vahi ride
 But the time was ruthless
 dhamaakaa hua, goliyaan chalin or teen vidya ke sharir main aakar atak gayi
 He still did not lose patience
 jab maukey par patrkaar pahunche, to khun se sane, jameen par pade vidya unhen nirdesh dene ke andaaj main bole, uthaakar baithaao mujhe
 Shukla's health deteriorated continuously
 jagadalpur ke aspataal main unki goliyaan nikaali gayi
 Then there was treatment in Raipur
 or aakhir main air ambulance main vah gudgaanv ke medanta medicity aspataal laae gaye
 The condition started improving after the initial days
 ek hafte pehle vah parivaar janon se ishaaron main baat karne lage the or ventilator se hataae jane kii baat bhi hone lagi thi
 But then the infection started
 badha or iske chalate unke ang ek ek kar kaam karne band ho gaye
 Vidya Charan Shukla breathed his last on Tuesday
 jangal se jis jindagi ne raftaar pakadi thi, vahiin achaanak ruk usne aakhri safar kaa rukka liya
 In the festival of giving cheap air tickets during the festive season, now the famous Air India flight service has also joined
 saarvajanik kshetra kii yah vimaanan company phir apane yatriyon ke liye diwali ke maukey par dhamaakedaar skim lekar ai he
 The company's 'diwali Dhamaka' scheme will continue till November 7, under which Air India has announced the sale of tickets starting from Rs 1,777 on its domestic network
 is dhamaakedaar skim ke tahat aap 15 janvari 2016 se 15 april 2016 ke bich main yatra kar paaenge
 Booking of these tickets can be done by 7 November
 in tikaton kii booking air india ke offis,website, mobile ap, kol centre or travel agent ke jariye kii ja sakati he
 ai's domestic network spans 50 destinations
 gauratlab he ki abhi haal hi main air asia, spice jet sahit kai vimaanan companiyon ne aise hi lubhaavne ophers kii ghoshnaa kii he
 The BJP is trying to persuade its own ally Shiv Sena, trying to reach a consensus among opposition parties, about the presidential election
 aise main shivasena ko manaane ke liye bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ravivaar ko uddhav thakare se mulaakaat karenge
 In fact, the Shiv Sena has decided to suggest a candidate for the post of President Swaminathan
 is pehle vah aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ke naam par adi thi, lekin na to aresas or na hi bijepi is par taiyaar dikhi
 In such a situation, the army has decided to step up and increase the name of Krishi Vigyan Swaminathan
 shivasena pramukhuddhav thakrene kaha, 'ham hindu raashtra hai, isliye mohan bhagwat hamaari pehali pasand hai
 But if there is any problem with his name, we will suggest the name of MS Swaminathan
 hindu raashtra ke alaava ham krishi pradhan raashtra bhi hai
 They have a solution to the problems of the farmers, so why not Swaminathan? ”sources from the army say that Swaminathan is a non-political person and he will be acceptable to all parties given his contribution in the agricultural sector
 kisaan lambey vakt se swaminathan report kii shiforishein lagu karne kii maang karti rahi hai, aise main unke raashtrapati banane se kisaanon main acha sandesh jayega

 Let us tell you, there are also reports that when the Cabinet was talking about giving exemption of 45 crores in income tax to the ICC, then the Information Broadcasting Minister Ambika Soni and Sports Minister Ajay Maken had objected, said that the ICC had already funded Why is Kubera then why ICC should be given a rebate of 45 crores

 The capital Delhi has been fighting the fog for the last few days
 saans lene ko taras rahi he
 The NGT and the Delhi High Court have also reprimanded the Delhi government, MCD and punjab-haryana
 jiske baad dilli sarkaar ne 5 dinon ke liye od ivan lagu karne kaa faisla kiya he
 But can only Delhi win this battle of pollution only through Aud Even? yaa kuch or bhi sakht kadam uthaane kii jarurat he
 1
 kya rajdhani he envyranment friendli?vikaas ke naam par shahar main rojaanaa lagaataar buildingen ban rahi hai
 But is work on making environment friendly in Delhi the same way
 agar pradooshan se ladanaa he to shahar ko green bananaa hoga, ped-paudhon ko badhaava dena hoga
 So that there is a change in the air conditions in this city surrounded by tall buildings
 or log saans le paaen
 Along with this, there is a need to emphasize on industrial policy also, because if smoke comes out from factories everywhere in the capital, breathing will be difficult
 2
 NGT has also reprimanded the government for the ongoing construction work and the pollution that is spreading from it
 dilli main sabhi prakaar ke nirmaan kaaryon par roak laga di gai he
 But this restriction is only for a few days, if the government has to find any concrete measures
 to rajdhani main nirmaan kaaryon ke liye koi niyamavali banane kii jarurat he
 Because not only government work is going on in Delhi, but also private construction work is being done daily, due to which the pollution is double hit
 3
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of the Bhumikadilly of neighboring states says that the pollution in Delhi is not just due to local reasons
 gauratlab he ki dilli se sate upi, haryana or punjab main in dinon kisaan paraali jalaate hai jiskaa dhuaan chaaron ore failata he
 It also has some impact on Delhi
 isliye dilli ko apane padosi rajyon ke saath milakar pradooshan par kaabo paane ke liye kuch thos plan bananaa hoga
 However, it would also be wrong to say that pollution is happening in Delhi only due to the burning of stubble in the neighboring states
 4
 Public Transport Delhi is the capital of the country
 yahaan lakhon log rojaanaa safar karte hai, lakhon log apni gadiyon, dupahiyaa vaahanon se chalate hai
 The government will have to improve public transport so that if one wants to abandon his personal vehicles and travel in Delhi, then he will not face any problem
 dijal bas ke alaava sarkaar ko electric bason par bhi focus badhanaa hoga
 Apart from this, there should also be a cycle track in the city so that people can get promoted for cycling
 shahar main metro to he lekin badhata kiraaya dekhakar log ab usamen bhi safar karne se ghabaraate nazar aate hai
 5
 vestage managementrajadhani hone ke kaaran dilli main duniya kii najaron main hameshaa bani rahati he
 But the piles of garbage placed everywhere not only spread the dirt but also pollute the environment
 dilli main kai landphil cites bhi hai jahaan kooday ke dher lage rahete hai
 Local people of Delhi also burn anything anywhere that causes smoke
 rajya sarkaar-emsidi-centre ko milakar dilli ko svachh rakhane ke liye thos kadam uthaanaa hoga
 a strict waste management is needed for the capital so that the environment is not contaminated
 desh kii rajdhani main sardiyon se thik pehlepradooshanki samasya logon ke liye musiibat banate ja rahi he
 The surprising thing is that contrary to the claims of government agencies, in many parts of Delhi, the rules are being flouted
 'ajtak' kii team ne pradooshan failaane vaali vajahon kii rokthaam kaa rielity check kiya he
 At some distance from India Gate and Rashtrapati Bhavan, pollution is being invited, ignoring the rules
 rajpath par mitti ke kai oonche dher bina kisi green cover ke khule main nazar aa rahe hai
 On one hand, Delhi's air is bad, while the agencies that take action against the pile of mud are also missing
 aapako bataa den ki nirmaan kaary ke dauraan malwa, ret yaa anya material ko green cover se dhankna anivaary he, jabaki rajpath par khuleam is niyam ko nazarandaz karte paaya gaya
 PM 10 and PM 2 in Delhi
 5 kaa str lagaataar badhate ja rahaa he
 Meanwhile, during the 'aaj Tak' special conversation, Delhi's Environment Minister Imran Hussain told that 15 teams of Environment Department are working to tackle pollution
 iske alaava 6 sadasyon kii ek kamity banaai gayi he
 The purpose of this committee is to conduct surprise inspections so that the polluters and its causes can be identified and action can be taken immediately
 mantri imran hossain ke mutabik 6 sadasyon kii kamity main emsidi, PWD, dilli police jaise vibhaagon kaa ek-ek sadsy hoga
 Also, 83 marshals in Delhi are also monitoring pollution
 ye marshall alag-alag ilaakon main ghumkar kooda jalaane, dhul se hone vaale pradooshan failaane waalon ke khilaaf ection lenge
 The Delhi government has reiterated the demand of the Central Government to give compensation to the farmers on the issue of stubble
 haal hi main dilli ke padosi rajyon se paraali jalane kii tasviren saamne ain thi
 Environment Minister Imran Hussain claims that the main cause of pollution in Delhi is the stubble burning by farmers in the fields and barns of neighboring states

 jiya khan bade sapanom ke saath saat samandar paar se mumbai ai thim
 The debut was also strong with Amitabh Bachchan
 aamir khan or akshay kumaar ke saath bhi kaam kiya lekin bahut kam log jaanate hai ki jiya kaa janm america main hua tha or parvarish landan main
 The reason for the suicide of Nafisa Khan aka Jia Khan is currently wrapped in the curtain of mystery, but as soon as Jia is mentioned, all the pictures of Jia's acting in which she made a serious and brilliant performance, attracted the attention of the audience and film critics
 Was drawn isi saal 20 farvari ko jiya ne apana 25waan janmdin manaaya tha
 Jia Khan was born on 20 February 1988 in New York
 pita ali rizvi khan bhartiya mul ke america naagarik the jabaki maa raabia amin hindi filmon kii abhinetri
 He was raised in London across the seven seas
 jiya khan ko viraasat main mili adaakaari kaa junun bachapan se tha lihaaja landan or neuyork main film abhinay or angreji sahitya kii padhai puri kii
 Jiya turned to Hindustan to fulfill the dreamy charm of films and her dreams in Bollywood
 logon ne jiya khan ke naam, chehre or abhinay ko tab janaa, jab unki pehali hindi film nishabd march 2007 main relies hui
 The first film and that too with megastar Amitabh Bachchan of the century
 filmi kariyar kii isse behatar or shandaar shuruyaat nahin ho sakati thi
 Jia was nominated for the Filmfare Best Female Debut Award for her debut film 'nishabd'
 2008 main jiya kii duusari hindi film 'gazani' relies hui
 In this film too, Jiah got an opportunity to work with Mr
 Perfectionist Aamir Khan
 jiya kii aakhri or teesri hindi film 2010 main relies hui film 'housephul' thi jisamen unke hero the akshay kumaar
 Zia Khan's journey to Bollywood theater was undoubtedly 3 films, but it was through these three films that Jiya got the audience interviewed with her performance, her sanity and her ability
 filmi safarnama chota jarur rahaa lekin teenon filmon main bade parde kii jin 3 kaddavar hastiyon ke saath kaam karne kaa mauka mila wo abtak kai nami giraami heroinon ko bhi naseeb nahin ho sakaa he
 Jia was also concerned with social issues apart from acting in films
 jaanwaron kii suraksha sunishchit karne ke liye jiya peta naam kii sanstha kii ambesder thim
 Apart from this, Jia had worked for the financial assistance of many relief institutions
 bahut kam log hi jaanate honge ki jiya ek trand singer or dancer bhi thim
 Jia came like a slight gust of wind and dispersed her scent in Fiza
 mahaj 25 saal kii umr main duniya ko yun chhodkar chale janaa yakeenan kisi bure sapane se kam nahin he, lekin itnaa jarur he ki jiya kii choti umr ko lambey samay tak yaad jarur kiya jayega
 The strongest aspect of the personality of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi as the ruler is to awaken the sense of pride in the public towards the past achievements of the society and great personalities of that region
 yahi unki adbhut kshamta or safalataa ke paracham kii gaatha bhi he
 They then combine this feeling with a sense of national pride
 yah sara kaam ve kai upayon se karte hai
 His speeches and well-organized exhibitions on occasions such as Republic Day and Independence Day, and accompanying documentaries to show
 kshetra vishesh kaa itihaas pesh karne vaali pradarshnee or documentries unke kaaryakramon kaa ek ahm hissaa hoti hai
 Take, for example, their district level goodwill mission of 2011
 sampradayik sadbhaav ke paigaam ko janata tak pahunchane ke liye vahaan kii bhugolic visheshtaon or itihaas par taiyaar pradarshnee bhi saath-saath yojit kii jaati thi, jinamein us jile ke mahapurushon, prakritik sansadhano or british shashan ke khilaaf sangharsh kii kahani, santon or anya mahaan shahid lok nayakon ke bare main bataaya jaataa
 In the exhibition of Junagadh it was told about Apa Giga, the great martyr of Junagadh Loknayak
 unki aadhyatmik abha or garibon ke prati samarpit saamaajik seva ne 200 saal pehle sthaneey logon ke man par apni paavan chhavi kii amit chhap banaai thi

 At a function of the Parsi community two years ago in Navsari, he called the Parsis to examine a document and staged a play on the 1890 meeting between Swami Vivekananda and Jamsetji Tata
 logon ke man main garv kaa ehsaas paidaa karne kii disha main unki sabase aitihaasik or abhootpurv pahal thi swatantraaa diwas or ganatantr diwas ke salanaa samaaroh ko rajya kii rajdhani gandhinagar main manaane kii bajaay har saal ek nae jile main manaanaa
 He took this decision at the same time that he took office in 2001 and since that day he has organized such events in almost all 26 districts
 2003 main modi ne ek or misaal kaayam kii, jab ve 1930 main divangat hue mahaan krantikari, swatantraaa senaanee or samaaj sudhaarak pandit shyaamaji krishna verma kii geneva main rakhi asthiyon ko desh kii mitti par waapas lekar aae
 Varma's will wrote that his urn be placed in Switzerland and sent back to India only when he is free from British rule
 modi ne na sirf unki raakh ko mathrubhumi kaa sparsh karaayaa, balki kuccha ke mandavi main verma kii janmasthali par unki yaad main ek khubasurat smarak bhi banwaaya
 Varma continued to fight for India's independence in England and Europe during 1900–1930
 landan main unke india house main thaharne vaale swatantraaa senaniyon main mahatma gandhi, gopal krishna gokhale, vir saavarkar, virendranath chattopadhyaay, lala hardayal, saath hi vladimir lenin bhi shaamil the
 Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru met Verma in the late 1920s when he was ill
 1930 main geneva main jab verma kii maut ho gai to bhagat singh, sukhdev or raajaguru (us samay un par assembly bam maamle main mukadmaa chal rahaa tha) ne lahore jail main unhen shradhanjali di thi
 But his urn in 2003 came 55 years after the independence of the country
 in paanch dashakon main kisi sarkaar ne us mahaan krantikari kii ichchhaaon kaa sammaan karne kii samvedansheeltaa nahin dikhaai
 Despite his solid contribution to the freedom struggle, his hope of setting foot on the soil of Azad country could not be fulfilled, but the grand memorial built by Modi in memory of that fearless Lal of the country has become the center of attraction of the tourists today
 modi ne aadhyatmikta kii buniyaad par bhi gauravshaalee gaatha kii imaarat buland karne kaa ek anoothaa kadam uthaaya he
 On the suggestion of Bhaiyyu Maharaj, a spiritual guru living in Indore, Modi is building a Sant Nagri (city of Saints) on 1,000 acres of land in northern Gujarat
 is nagari ko bhartiya rajyon kii sankhya ke aadhaar par utane hi hisson main baanta jayega or har hisse ko ek-ek rajya kaa naam dekar us rajya vishesh ke pramukh santon ke ashramon kaa praturup vahaan banaaya jayega
 These include Sufi saints and their story will be told
 modi kii shakhsiyat ke kuch pahalu kaaphi jatil bhi dikhte hai
 For example, his stubborn attitude, which is often regarded by people as arrogance
 yah kabhi-kabhi unke ravaiye ko lekar logon ke man main andeh paidaa kar detaa he
 BJP MLA of Gujarat State Legislative Assembly, dedicated to serving the public, Dr
 kanu kalsaaria ne 2008 main jab paryaavaran or aarthik parinaamon ke bare main vichaar karte hue bhavnagar ke paas mahuwa ke tateey ilaake main cement plant lagane kii anumati par apni hi sarkaar ko katghare main khadaa kiya to modi ne unase baat karne se inkaar kar diya or pariyojna ko hari jhandi dikhaa di
 The result was that both the project and Kalsaria turned away from Modi
 kalsaaria ne gusse main bijepi chhod di or pariyojna ke khilaaf daayar kii gai unki yachika par gaur karte hue supreme court ne us par roak laga di
 Now in 2014, Kalsaria joined the Aam Aadmi Party
 modi ke bare main yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki unamem apana prachaar karne kaa junun he or ve choti se choti cheez se bhi badi vaahvahee luutane kii bhoomika bana lete hai
 His bold photographs have been presented as proof of his attachment to the publicity, peeping through the hoardings, small and large, about various government schemes all over Gujarat
 lekin modi ko koi fark nahin padataa
 In 2007, i once asked him about this, he turned back and asked me, "why should i not do this when i am doing good work?" This is my right
 koi bhi meri tarah lambey samay tak kadi mehnat nahin karata
 Also people love me and listen to me
 yah meri ranneeti kaa hissaa he ki main apni yojanaon ko apane naam kaa istemaal kar lokapriy banaaun
 "his argument is also true to a large extent
 bharat main shaayad hi aisa koi mukhyamantri hoga jo modi kii tarah mehnat karata ho or shashan kii har choti se choti baarikiyon par gahari najar rakhata ho
 An old charge against him personally is that his behavior towards his political colleagues is extremely cold and mean
 haalanki modi nijee taur par hameshaa iskaa khandan karte aae hai
 This is the reason that there are few people among his permanent friends
 is aarope ke jawaab main modi apane sahyogiyon ke prati dikhaai gai udaartaa kii kai misaalen pesh karne lagate hai
 There is an interesting incident related to Modi in this regard
 ek din modi jab apane ek puraane biimaar sahakarmi ko dekhne nahin pahunche to unhone modi ko phone kiya or na aane par shikaayat kii
 Modi said in typical Alafaz, “there is a manufacturing flaw in my body texture
 agar mujhe kisi ke liye kuch mahasoos ho bhi rahaa he to main use sahi tareeke se vyakt karne main asamarth hum
 Whenever you see such negativity in me, tell me immediately
 agar mujhe baat sahi lagi to main use thik kar luungaa
 The very next day, Modi reached his house to see his colleague
 modi kaa aisa bartaav unki niraali spashtvaadita, sahajata ke saath galati kaboolna or seekhney kii lalak dikhaata he
 My experience was similar when one day in 2006, he called me and said, "now some differences have emerged between me and a section of the Sangh Parivar
 ve mere bare main galat kahaniyaan failaa sakate hai
 You know both of us very well and as a journalist you are free to make a vision of yourself
 lekin koi bhi nakaaratmak chhavi banane se pehle mujhe achche se parakh len
 ”his tall claims have also troubled him many times and tarnished his image
 2007 main unhone daawa kiya ki rajya sarkaar kii sahaayak company gujarat state petroleum ne krishna godavari basin main 20 tisief gas kaa strot paaya he, jabaki diarectorat of hydrocarbon ne jaanch kar bataaya ki yah sirf 2 tisief he
 But the Modi government also has its own side in this story
 unke adhikariyon kaa daawa he ki keji basin main jiespisi ke tahat 500 varg mile ke ilaake main sirf 17 varg mile ko hi khangala gaya he
 Therefore, there is still hope of getting more gas in the future
 nishpaksh dharna banane kii kshamta ke saath hi modi main ek or khubi he jo ek achche shaasha ke liye utani hi jaruri he—apane kaam-kaaj ke tareeke or bartaav se ve apane samarthakon ke saath-saath apane virodhiyon ke man main bhi ek tarah kaa khauf paidaa karte hai
 Its effect on the supporters is that they execute the policies and decisions made by Modi literally
 vahiin, virodhiyon kii pareshaani yah hoti he ki unhen samaj main nahin aata ki ek aise shatru kaa bhala kaise muqabla kiya jaae jiske agle kadam kaa koi andaja nahin
 Modi has managed to create a tight and mysterious circle around him
 aisa isliye ki jab ve ahm muddon par faisla lene ke liye vichaar kar rahe hon to unke kareebi ko bhi uske bare main antim palon tak koi bhanak na lage
 This style of Modi has played an important role in his administrative-political success as it forces his subordinates to follow their decisions blindly
 masalan, 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad jab har kisi ko yah ummid thi ki kisi bujurg vyakti ko vidhansabha adhyaksh banaaya jayega, modi ne 42 saal ke adivasee vidhayak ganpat vaasav ko yah pad de diya
 Vasava became the youngest assembly speaker in the history of Gujarat and also the first tribal to reach this milestone
 apane maatahaton se charchaa karte samay kisi masale par agar unke man main koi shankaa jaage bhi to modi apane man ke andar ghumdate vichaaron kaa andaja nahin lagane dete, par kisi faisle yaa niti ke prati ve puri tarah se aashwast hote hai to khule dil se samarthan jataate hai
 Perhaps he has kept Chanakya in his mind as a guru who has said in economics, "even the family of the king does not know what he is going to decide tomorrow
 ”jahaan tak prabandhan kaushal kii baat he, sangh main unke himachati bhi unka loha maanate hai
 It is necessary to present an example here
 varsh 1969 main modi uttari gujarat ke sidhpur main sangh ke ek prashikshan shivi kii dekharekh kar rahe the
 The late Laxmanrao Inamdar, Modi's guide in the Sangh, gave him a bag full of 50,000 rupees to keep with him and asked him to return it on the last day of training
 inamdaar ne jab unase poocha ki ve rupayon ko kaise sambhalakar rakhenge, modi ne jawaab diya, “yah aap mujhapar chhod dijie
 They will be safe with me
 ” der raat modi ne prashikshan shivi ke paas hi ek ped ke neeche gaddha khodakar bag ko usamen dabaa diya
 For the next two days, in the morning and evening, Modi would sit at the exact same place with others and talk about the strategy related to training
 antim din jab inaamdaar ji ko lekar modi us jagah par gaye or mitti hataakar bag nikaala, to vah modi kii kushalta dekhakar hatprabh rah gaye
 Parendu Bhagat alias Kaku ji, a BJP leader who knows Modi very closely, and the son of a prominent Sangh leader, says, “from the very first day, his new ideas and way of working impressed everyone
 ”mere jehan main modi ke bare main ek or vakya ubharta he
 In October 2002, Modi embarked on a chariot, the Gujarat Gaurav Yatra, during a period of massive Hinduism
 gujarat ke kabyli ilaake main unki rathyatra main mujhe bhi shaamil hone kaa mauka mila
 As we were leaving the city of Chhota Udaipur, Modi shook his hand and greeted a Muslim couple greeting him
 modi ne driver ko rath rokane ke liye kaha
 The man had a bijpai scarf wrapped around his neck
 us dampati ke saath unki do choti-choti betiyaan thim
 Both must have been under seven years of age
 jaise ham ruke, vah aadmi apane parivaar ke saath modi ke paas aayaa
 He introduced himself as a local BJP worker
 modi ne bade dulaar se ek bacchee kaa gaal chuaa or kaha, “inhen har haal main skool bhejie
 i want one of these to be a doctor or an engineer
 kabhi koi jarurat ho to mere paas aaen
 "as the chariot progressed, the emotional Modi clapped his hand and said," i am overwhelmed by the love that the people of the state are getting
 aaj maine ek pran liya he
 i will never break the trust that the people of Gujarat have expressed in me
 ” yadi aap mukhyamantri ke taur par unki yatra ko vivaadon or uplabdhiyon, donon ke aadhaar par parakhen, to yahi paaenge ki modi apane vaade par khare utre hai
 Probably more than they thought themselves

 - input bhashaa Accused Yashpal Singh sought death sentence from the Home Ministry in the court, sentenced to death, hearing till 30 September
 The validity of constitution of Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate cases related to 1984 Sikh riots in Delhi High Court Has been challenged

 @mrrogerfabria post shared by David Warner (@davidwarner31) onaug 7, 2017 at 2:33am PDT BJP protests against Godse Sadhvi Pragya Thakur's statement on Godse: The fight against those who praised Godse was seen in a shocking picture at the state BJP office in Madhya Pradesh's capital Bhopal on Wednesday
 yahaan sainkadon kii sankhya main bijepi ke mahila or purush kaaryakarta haathon main laathiyaan lekar ghanton bijepi daftar ke baahar date rahe
 Demanding action on Pragya Thakur, BJP workers were waiting for the Congress workers who came here with sticks and sticks in their hands outside their own party office
 bhopal madhya se congress vidhayak aarif masood ne elaan kiya tha ki wo buudhvaar dopaher 12:30 baje congress kaaryakartaaon ke saath bijepi ke pradesh karyaalay kaa gheraav karenge
 He said that in this demonstration, BJP MP Sadhvi Pragya Thakur's statement on Godse will demand action against him
 congress vidhayak ne kaha tha ki vopragna thakur ko partise nishkasit karne kii maang karte hue pradesh adhyaksh ke naam gyaapan denge
 In view of this, BJP workers took a morcha outside their office from Wednesday morning and started waiting for the Congress workers armed with sticks
 bich raste me roka congress kaaryakartaaon kobijepi karyaalay ke baahar lathi-dandon ke saath maujuud bijepi kaaryakartaaon kii bheed ko dekhte hue police ko ashanka thi kahin donon party ke kaaryakartaaon main takaraav kii sthiti naa ban jaae isaliye ilaake main baari police bal tainaat kiya gaya tha
 At the same time, barricading was also done on the way towards the BJP office
 congress kaaryakartaaon kii raily ko bhi police ne aadhe raste par hi bairicading kar roak liya
 Finally here, Arif Masood ended his protest and said that even though he could not go to the BJP office, his fight against those who praised Gandhi's killer Godse would continue
 bijepi ke haath main 22 saal se gujarat kii kaman hone se satta virdohi rujhaan kii sambhaavna jataae jane ke baavjood, GST or notebandi ko lekar vyapaariyon main badi bechaini ke baavjood, patidaar-obisi-thakor-daliton ke andolan ke baavjood gujarat main phir camel khilne ja rahaa he
 According to India today-axis My India Opinion Poll, BJP is going to retain this state considered to be its stronghold
 exis maai india poling agency ne 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main modi kii aandhi kaa sateek anumaan lagaaya tha
 Subsequently, the agency's estimates of Delhi, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh assembly elections also proved correct
 exis kii ore se 15 sitambar se 15 oktober ke bich gujarat kii sabhi 182 vidhansabha siton ke liye karaae gaye opinian pole ke mutabik bijepi 115 se 125 siton par jeet kaa paracham lahraane ja rahi he
 The Gujarat assembly elections in 2007 and 2012 for the BJP had seen similar results
 opinian pole ke mutabik gujarat kii mukhya vipakshi party congress ke khate main 57 se 65 siten aati dikh rahi hai
 In the last assembly election of 2012, Congress won 60 seats
 exis maai india pole main 18243 pratibhaagiyon ke sample ekatra kiye gaye
 48% of the participants said to vote for BJP
 vahiin 38% ne congress ke paksh main raay jataai
 The difference of 10 per cent in votes in a two-pronged race is enough to show that the BJP is going to take over the power of Gujarat by defeating the anti-incumbency trend
 22 saal se gujarat kii satta main hone kii vajah se bijepi ke khilaaf satta virdohi rujhaan kii sambhaavna kii baat kii jaati rahi he
 Opinion polls show that Congress leads in 32 per cent of the voters
 inamen 10% muslim, 6% dalit or 16% patidaar hai
 At the same time, BJP has a strong hold on the decisive 67% voters
 inamen obisi 37%, asti 15% or saamaanya 15% hai
 This opinion poll has taken cognizance of the possibility of additional votes for the Congress with the support of OBC youth leader Alpesh Thakor and Dalit activist Jignesh Mevani
 lekin is opinian pole main un atirikt voton kaa sangyaan nahin liya he jo patidaar netaa hardik patel ke congress ko samarthan jataane kii surat main vipaksh ke khate main ja sakate hai
 Over the past few years, Hardik Patel has emerged as an influential leader of the Patidar community
 patidaaron ko gujarat main raajnneetik nazariye se majboot samudaay mana jaataa he
 Patidars account for 16% of Gujarat's total voters
 patidaar gujarat kii 182 siton main se 21 par nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaane kii sthiti main hai
 There is still speculation about Hardik whether he will support Congress directly or not
 apni reliyon main hardik jor dekar ye kehete rahe hai ki wo chaahate hai ki ‘patidaar yuvakon par hamalaa karne vaali ahamkaari bijepi ko unke samarthak satta se ukhaad phenke
 However, Hardik has so far avoided declaring open support for the Congress
 somvaar ko hardik ne ahmedabad main congress netaaon ke saath apni mulaakaat ko bhi sikret rakhane ke liye har sambhav koshish kii
 Hardik has officially denied meeting with Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi
 vahiin congress ke kuch netaaon kaa kahana he ki is tarah kii mulaakaat vaaki ahmedabad ke ek hotel ke kamare main hui
 The participants in the Axis My India Opinion Poll asked if they would go with the party to which Hardik would declare their support
 kul pratibhaagiyon main 2% ne kaha ki patidaar yuva turk (hardik) jis party ko kahenge, usee kaa samarthan karenge
 The Axis My India poll also presented the second scenario to the contestants
 poocha gaya ki agar hardik patel aadhikarik taur par congress ko samarthan dene kaa elaan karte hai to kya rukh rahegaa
 According to the pollsters of Axis My India, if Hardik openly declares his support for the Congress, the vote share of this party can increase from 38% to 40%
 aisi surat main congress ko 5 se 10 or siton kaa phayda ho saktaa he
 The same loss can result in seat numbers for BJP
 hardik ke congress ko samarthan se bijepi ko nuksaan hoga lekin ye itnaa bada nahin hoga ki hai voltage vaale is chunaav main uskaa garh hi uske haath se nikal jaae
 This election is also considered a question of credibility for the powerful pair of modi-shah
 haalanki ye dhyaan main rakhaa janaa chahie ki ye opinian pole 15 oktober se pehle hua tha
 This does not include the impact of events after the sample was taken from the field for the open poll
 jo saaf najar aa rahaa he wo ye he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi hi chunaav main bijepi ke liye sabase bade aakarshan bane hue hai
 66% of the participants believe that Gujarat has benefited since Narendra Modi became Prime Minister
 74% jitna pratibhaagiyon kaa bada hissaa maanata he ki narendra modi sarkaar ne acha yaa bahut acha kaam kiya he
 In Gujarat, the BJP is facing pressure from the anti-incumbency trend, but this has not affected the credibility of the 'earth-son' who rose to the position of Prime Minister of the country
 gujarat main pichley kai chunaavon se modi magic kaam karata aayaa he or tikhe satta virdohi rujhaan ke baavjood rajya ke votaron ne modi main hi vishwaas jataayaa
 Opinion poll estimates suggest that the citizens of Gujarat are still in Modi's favor
 bijepi ke liye sabase bada sirdard guds and sarvice tex yani GST ko lekar vyapaariyon kii bechaini sabit ho rahaa he
 Gujarat is considered a merchant dominated state

 The Taliban is stunned by the actions of the Government of Pakistan at many of its bases
 taliban ne swat ghati or darra aadamkhel main pakistan sarkaar kii karrwai ke khilaaf islamabad par hamalaa karne kaa elaan kar diya he
 First the capture of the afghan-pak border, then the FATA area of pakistan, then the annihilation of Swat and now the Taliban's vulture eye on Islamabad
 yakeenan maamla behad khatarnaak he
 The Taliban has become so deadly that it has now threatened terrorist organizations like lashkar-e-taiba, Harkatul Mujahideen and Hizbul Mujahideen
 taliban kaa kahana he ki agar islamabad par hamale kii saazish main pakistan ke in himachati aatanki sanghathanon ne kuch bolaa to unki bhi khayr nahin
 The Taliban are also friends with these terrorist organizations
 taliban ke aatanki in sanghathanon ke saath milakar aatank kii training bhi lete hai
 Not only this, many terrorist organizations like Taliban and Lashkar also carry out joint attacks in many attacks
 lekin taliban aatank kii duniya main us mukaam tak pahunch chukaa he ki wo ab ek se ek ghaatak lashkar jaise aatanki sanghathanon se bhi loha lene ko taiyaar he
 The Taliban suspect that terrorist organizations may put pressure on them to stop their mission to Islamabad
 lekin batulla mehsood or fazalulla kii fouj ne khulla elaan kar diya he ki agar aisa hua to wo in aatanki sanghathanon ko bhi dekh lenge
 The strength of the Taliban and enmity with Pakistan can be gauged from this
 ab usko nazar aa rahaa he sirf islamabad
 Now the question arises whether Pakistan's militant terrorist organizations will oppose the Taliban
 or agar aisa hua to kya taliban apane mishan ko puraa karne ke liye lashkar, hijbul jaise aatanki sanghathanon ko bhi takkar degaa
 And will Pakistan seek the help of terrorist organizations to fail the Taliban's mission to Islamabad? ab ye to zaahir ho chukaa he ki taliban ke aantki wo training bhi hasil kar chuke hai ki kisi badi napak saazish ko anjaam de saken
 This conspiracy by the Taliban has probably caught the Pakistan Army
 paak kii sena ne 11 talibani aatankiyon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya
 In Bajaur area, Pakistani troops opened fire on Taliban militants in a helicopter
 maare gaye 11 aatankiyon main taliban ke saath saath alqaida ke aatanki bhi ho sakate hai

 The film Shree 420's iconic song Pyaar Kiya Ikkar
 
 
 hindi cinema ke yaadgaar geeton main se ek he
 The film portrays a beautiful romance between Raj Kapoor and Nargis
 lekin is gane main ek seen he jab raaj kapur or naragis ke saath sadak ke kinare teen bachche chal rahe hai
 It would be surprising to know that all three children wearing raincoats in the roadside rain belong to the Kapoor family
 sabase chota or mast dikh rahaa baccha koi or nahin rishi kapur he
 The other children seen in this scene are siblings of Rishi Kapoor
 papa kii film main pehla seen shoot karte hue ro pade the rishi kapoorhaal hi main rishi kapur 102 note out film ke pramotion ke liye event par pahunche the
 During this, while sharing many experiences related to his film career, Rishi Kapoor told that Pyaar Kiya Ikkara
 
 
 gane main meri umr bahut kam thi
 In the song, i was supposed to walk along the road with my siblings
 meraa ye seen beshak dekhne main aasaan lage lekin ise shoot karnaa bahut mushkil tha
 This scene was shot in the rain, as i started walking, i had water on my face
 bas phir kya tha
 
 
 i started crying badly and closed my eyes
 tab puri shooting roak di gai or naragis ji mere paas ain
 He said that i will give you chocolate
 tum chup ho jaao
 At that time, instead of a chocolate, i gave the first shot of my life while walking in the rain without crying
 ye seen bahut khaas tha kyonki papa kii film main meraa pehla seen tha
 Roorishi Kapoor told me that my name was found in the Joker on the dining table, that my election was released in the 1970 Mera Naam Joker also finalized on the dinner table
 papa raaj kapur lead role main the, mujhe unke skool time kaa kirdaar nibhaana tha
 We all sat down to eat with Papa and mother at the dinner table
 tabhi papa ne maa se kaha ki main chahta hum chintu mere bachapan kaa role film main nibhaae
 Hearing this, the mother simply said that there should be no hindrance in her studies
 main bhi vahaan maujuud un donon kii baaten chupchaap sunata rahaa
 i had my dinner with my mother and father and did not react to them
 rishi kapur ne bataaya ki film main kaam ko lekar main itnaa khush tha ki khaane kii teble se sidhaa apane kamare main aayaa
 On reaching there, i took out a pen-paper and started practicing autographs
 rote hue khud ko shishe main dekhte the rishi kapoorintervyuu ke dauraan rishi kapur ne bataaya ki main bachapan main maa kii maar khaane ke baad buree tarah rota tha
 After crying, i always looked at my face in the mirror
 ye baat mujhe sahi se yaad nahin lekin shashi kapur ankal mujhe hameshaa ye baat yaad karaate the
 In this way, i can say that i used to watch my act even while weeping

 For the Daredevils, explosive openers David Warner and Virender Sehwag have indicated that they will be in their form, while all-rounders in the middle order are Venugopal Rao, Aaron Finch, Naman Ojha, Yogesh Nagar and Matthew Wade who have their batting
 Can change the stance of the match anytime
 warner ne deccan chargers ke khilaaf khele gaye mukaable main 51 ranon kii pari kheli thi, lekin is mukaable ko daire davills haar gaya tha
 His bowlers' poor form remains a concern for captain Sehwag
 irfan pathan or umesh yadav ab tak asarhin rahe hai, jabaki morne morkel, ajit agarkar, andrew makdonald or varun aron vikalp ke rup main maujuud rahenge
 On the other hand, the responsibility of giving Punjab a fast start will be on the shoulders of captain Adam Gilchrist and opener Paul Valthaty
 valthti in dinon behtareen form main hai or unase team ko kaaphi ummiden hai
 Walthty has played four matches in this competition so far and has scored 82

 But have you ever thought why it is necessary to take a bath? If someone asks you, perhaps you would say that bathing keeps freshness, which gives energy to work throughout the day
 par nahaane ke itane hi phaayde nahin hai
 There are many other benefits of bathing that do not get our attention

 Which indicates that you are not paying attention to your skin at all

 If you have any problem related to the skin, then it may be that your reason is not to take a bath

 Not bathing for a long time also causes itching problem

 He says, "I don't smoke
 mujhe asthma he
 This perception has been created by the kind of films i make and roll my cigarette with my hand
 meraa kabhi koi gut nahin rahaa
 i have never liked people who say yes
 main badale kii bhaavana vaale samikshakon ko apane daayre se baahar rakhata hum
 There are enough healthy critics around me
 main apane saare saathiyon ko apni filmein dikhaata hum
 From Shimit Amin to Zoya Akhtar and Shujit Sarkar, i have seen many cuts from my films and have responded
 unhone bina kisi agenda ke meri filmon ko behatar banane main madad kii he
 That is why i have slowly sorted those who bring the agenda
 ”anuraag apane prashansakon ko bhale aaj khaarij kar rahe hon, par prashansak yah mahasoos karte hai ki anuraag ab mukhyadhara ke khemon kii sweekruti ke liye baichaiyn hai
 He is now eager to work with the Kapoor camp by removing the tag of Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Rajkumar Rao
 karan johar ke saath hui unki taaja dosti bahut kuch kah rahi he
 However, he says, "I have always wanted to do what i want
 unhone meri har film ko khaarij kiya he
 Whether it was No Smoking (2007) or Gangs of Wasseypur (2012)
 bombai velvet khaas he kyonki yah bade bajet kii bade sitaron vaali film he
 They will wait until its release to find an excuse to dismiss it
 ”unki pehali feechar film paanch ko 2001 main sensor board ne hinsa or nirashavad ke kaaran pratibandhit kar diya tha, jisamen yah dikhaane kii koshish kii gai thi ki bombai shahar ne unhen or unke saathiyon ko kaise gadha tha
 Today this film can be watched for free on the Internet
 anuraag ke cinemai nazariye main shahar ek kendriya tatv ke rup main baar-baar aata he, jisaki pahchaan blike friday se lekar bombai velvet tak kii ja sakati he
 This is the answer to the fact that Kashyap does not make crime films but lives them himself
 unheen ke shabdon main, “is tarah kii filmein banane kaa najariya sadakon par jeene se paidaa hota he
 As far as i am concerned, the same world has always drawn me: how does the man of the street enter the world in which he is always looking outward
 vah bheetar ghus jaataa he or uskaa hissaa ban jaataa he
 After this, the entire perception of Apnape, or say, to try to create Apnapa, it all comes
 ” yah apanaapa hi he jo aaj bhi unhen bharamaata he
 Gangs of Wasseypur or Dev d (2009), all of Anurag's characters are almost non-bombay
 ye kirdaar usee bombai kii channi se hokar guzarate hai jisane kashyap ko gadha tha, jahaan raat ke andhere main aadmi gandhaati bhaap main tabdeel ho jaataa he to auraten, jaisaa aalochak roger abert ne kabhi kaha tha, aapako apane ishk main maar daalati hai
 From feminists to the film industry, there is such an atmosphere as Anurag has spoiled them
 ve kehete hai, “ye log apane upar kuch nahin sah sakate
 We cannot even recite jokes because it exposes their hypocrisy
 ” bollywood kii yuva peedi ke saath unke judaav kii vajah unki yahi bebaaki he
 There is no such thing as sorry in this speech
 jaahir he, aise tamaam khedvihin logon ke liye anuraag sangrakshak kaa kaam karte hai- anoushka sharma se lekar nimrat cor, navazuddin siddiki se lekar eibi team tak
 He says that his own fight is never going to stop, "in this country, cinema counts crores and zeros and it is being decided what is right and what is wrong
" jo paisa nahin bana paata vah galat he or jisase paisa banataa he, vah sahi he
 If you have to fight to save a certain kind of cinema, then you have to make some sacrifices
 aapako apni ladaai khud ladani he
 And i want to get out of here now because i have seen so much
 ” aaj unhen vyavsaayik kamyaabi kii sakht jarurat he jiske liye rachanaatmakataa kaa balidaan karnaa hoga, haalanki ve kabhi bhi aisi keemat chukaane ko taiyaar nahin rahe hai

 This is Kashyap's first role in Villain
 ve kehete hai, “main vaastavik jivan main bhi khalanaayak hum
 This is the impression about me
 ” or aisa kehete hue ve khud ko jabaran nicha dikhaane kii koshish karte hai
 Today they are seen in some relief
 aisa lagata he ki ve apane ateet kii parachhaaiyon se nikalakar, apni kamajoriyon ko chhupaakar khol se baahar nikle hai
 He says, "dark is a relative term
 bharat main chunki har cheez itani naram or chamakdaar he ki main uski tulana main dark dikhataa hum
 They look at me with stern eyes
 har koi tarantino (kventin) ko dark kahata he
 Of course my skin is very thick and dark in terms of work

 Most people become pessimistic as they age, but they are the result of pessimism

 He insists, "I do not believe there has been any change in my idealism
" nirashavad ja chukaa he
 Now i am in a normal state
 ” ve ab gussa hona chhod chuke hai or un logon ko bhi, jo unke gusse par palate the
 At first, he got alone to get rid of this anger, "but now i am comfortable with myself
 meri jindagi pehle ke mukaable kahin behatar he
 i am very sensitive to negativity, to anything that is not constructive
 main chijen banane main yakeen karata hum
 i am not one of those who stay here and do not change the system
 ” ve is baat kii parvaah nahin karte ki industry kis ore ja rahi he
 In his farewell also, he is engaged in holding industry meetings with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to create an alternative platform for independent films called Filmbe
 anuraag jaise filmkaar ke liye vastav main yah mumkin nahin ki vah bharat main tike rahakar kaamyaab filmein bana sake
 They do not see the audience divided into rural and urban
 ve kehete hai, “main sirf yah dekhne kii koshish karata hum ki mere paas paryaapt darshak hai yaa nahin
 i find that i have enough viewers for whom i can make films that i believe in
 haalanki andar se main ek hi shaks ke liye film banaata hum, sirf apane liye
 After years of obscure films like No Smoking, Kashyap has made himself capable of communicating with others
 ve kehete hai, “ab main apni baat zyada sahaj cinemai tareeke se samajha paata hum
 With his film on Bombay, he wants to say goodbye to the city
 yah kahani un tamaam chizon kii he jinhone milakar kashyap ko gadha
 All the things that Kashyap will now leave behind
 unhone khud ko bauddhikta kii us dhara se kaat liya he jise anjaane main unhone posa tha
 They have stopped reading newspapers
 apane bare main kii gai tippaniyon ke liye soshal media ko khangaalana band kar diya he
 “I am writing, studying, watching movies, tabooing and dating
 main khud ke saath vakt bitaa rahaa hum or jivan ke ek achche daur main hum
 "if so, then what is the need to run That too France? Does this make up for the France he felt in Kalki? They laugh at it and say that like my colleagues, you are also tying me in such phrases that are convenient for you
 ve bas raahat kii saans lenaa chaahate hai or cinema ke maamle main france duniya kaa sabase zyada mithravat desh he
 All the world's cinema is first released in Paris
 akele french sikh lene bhar se prabhaavon kii nai duniya saamne khul sakati he
 In the words of Anurag, "there is a beginning after the end of something
 main dobaaraa shuruyaat karnaa chahta hum
 i want to go and make films where people have less boundaries
 main khud ko jhonk dena chahta hum lekin yahaan ek seemaa ke baad yah mumkin nahin he
 It is not that Bombay does not inspire me anymore, it is just that i am motivated even then i am not able to do anything here
 main itnaa kuch karnaa chahta hum jo yahaan nahin kar paata
 i cannot make a bitter political film here
 mujhe aisa nahin karne diya jayega
 Better than that, i go away
 ”kashyap ke saathi vikaas bahal, vikramaditya motwane or madhu montena bhi paripakv ho chuke hai
 He says, "vikas and Vikram are doing most of the work
 ve mere mukaable das guna kaam kar rahe hai
 The forces behind Phantom are mainly Vikas and Vikram
 ” kashyap kii koi yojana nahin he
 He says, "I go everywhere like this
 kalki aapako bataaegiah maine hameshaa kaha he ki chalo kahin or chalate hai or nai shuruyaat karte hai
 i like to start from zero

 ) Apne Apne Agnaye (in two volumes) Om Thanviwani Prakashan, New Delhi: Price: Rs 1,500
 vaniprakashan@gmailvarra 2011 kai bade rachanakaaron kaa janm shatabdi varsh tha-faij, nagarjun, shamsher, agyeya, kedarnath agarwal aadi
 Birth centenary year was celebrated in academic circles
 patr-patrikaon ne visheshank nikaalkar apana dharm nibhaayaa
 The most controversial of this entire process was the 'agnostic' personality of the most controversial Sachchidananda Hiranand Vatsyayan, and also worthwhile
 yah tathy is baat kaa parichaayak he ki agyeya ke vyaktitv or sahitya main aisa kuch he jo pathakon se samvaad karata he
 Om Thanvi has edited his own Agnayya, a two-part book of memoirs written on the unknowable
 is sankalan main agyeya ke samakaleen or agyeya se kisi-na-kisi rup main sambandhit rahe sau pramukh logon ke sansmaran shaamil kiye gaye hai
 This book is like a reference book rather than a normal book memorialized
 iske 'sansmaranon' main agyeya ke vyaktitv se lekar saahitiyik jivan kii smritiyaan to hai hi, saath hi unka thithivaar jivan-vrutt, prakaashan varsh ke saath unki kritiyon kii suchi or agyeya se sambandhit pustakon kii suchi ke alaava ek acchhee anukramanika bhi he
 Memoirs also have two interesting features - these memoirs are not only a tribute to a late writer but also present a variety of images of his personality and writings in a critical manner; Secondly, it has included memoirs of his opponents, even some from his opponents
 sabhi pakshon ko saamne rakhkar pathakon ko raay banane kii chhot dena ek eemaandaar sampadak kii pahchaan hoti he or om thanvi ne jansatta se lekar is pustak tak main apane sampadak dharm ko bakhubi nibhaayaa he
 Thanvi played 'char Words?' For a good role
 Reading the book by writing has made the way of those descending to understand the unknowable - by making them aware of the complexities of the way
 pichley hi varsh muanjodaro jaisaa yatra vrittant likhakar thanvi sahitya kii duniya main ek jaruri hastkshep kar chuke hai
 Reflexes in the selection and editing of material can also be seen in this book
 thanvi ne ek achche sansmaran-sankalan kii visheshta spasht karte hue likhaa he, ''acha sansmaran rachana kaa sukh detaa he
 It contains facts, events (or accidents), about the author, details of his works, some deliberations, but ultimately the memoir is a simple reconstruction of time with the help of memory
 '' vastav main apane apane agyeya us samay kii punarrachana he, jisamen agyeya rach rahe the
 In these memoirs, various forms of agnostic have emerged
 ek sahityakar ke rup main kavita, kahani, upanyaas, naatak, vyangy, sansmaran, yatra-vrittant, diary, stambh, anuwaad, niabandh, aalochana aadi vidhaon main agyeya ne shashakt hastkshep kiya, vahiin jivan main chhapamari, yayavari, adhyaapan, patrakarita, chitrakala, murtikla, chhayakaari, pakkala, badhaigiri, darjigiri, keshkartan, bagwani aadi main haath daalaa or kuch sarthak karne kaa prayaas kiya
 It is certainly important to write about an important writer of his time by a hundred important writers, critics
 or is udhyam ko sarthak banane ke liye patr-patrikaon or pustakon main purv prakashit sansmaranon ko sankalit karne ke alaava kunwar narayan, kedarnath singh, vishwanath treepathi, vijaymohan singh, ganga prasad vimal, rajesh joshi aadi darjanon lekhakon ne is kitaab ke liye vishesh rup se likhaa he, jisase sankalan main taazgi aa gai he
 Thanvi has given ample opportunity to the reader to create an 'agnostic image' in his imagination by printing a critical memoir of the counterparties
 aise main lambii bhoomika ke bahaane sampadak kaa agyeya par lage aaropon kaa jawaab taiyaar karnaa thodaa khatkata he
 The titles of the memoirs appear to prepare a prelude to the literary level and significance of the material compiled in the book, such as 'the road where the end ends' (vishnu Prabhakar), 'which he hunts' (krishna Sobti), 'verses in silence' (prabhash Joshi), 'man's third eye' (vishwanath Prasad Tiwari), 'one and a half words and Jalebi' (pankaj Bisht) etc
 is tarah agyeya janm shatabdi ke avasar par taiyaar yah sankalan agyeya ke jivan or sahitya ko sahmatiyon-asahmatiyon ke saath vimarsh ke centre main laane main madad karegaa or agyeya ke adhyetaon ke liye sandarbh granth kii tarah kaam aayega, yahi isaki sarthakata he

 nyaayamurti priti singh ne sibiai kii closer report kaa sangyaan lete hue talwaar danpati ko 28 farvari ko adaalat ke saamne pesh hone kaa saman jari kiya
 Aarushi's parents have been charged with murder, destruction of evidence, conspiracy and intent to commit the crime
 adaalat ne sibiai report ke khilaaf daayar rajesh talwaar kii yachika ko khaarij kar diya or aparaadhiyon ko pakadaney ke liye phir se jaanch karne ke liye kaha
 CBI counsel RK Saini told reporters that the court, taking cognizance of the offenses under Sections 302, 201, issued summons to Dr
 Rajesh and Nupur Talwar to appear as accused on February 28
 talwaar dampatti ko bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 302 (hatya), 201 (saboot nasht karne) or dhara 34 (ek khaas iraade se kai logon dwaara kiye gaye kisi kaary) ke tahat aaropee banaaya gaya he
 The CBI had said on Tuesday that circumstantial evidence points to the involvement of the Talwar couple in the murder of Aarushi and Hemraj
 saini ne mangalvaar ko kaha tha, hamaara rukh yah he ki jaanch adhikari kii jaanch se sabit hota he ki is maamle main koi bahari vyakti shaamil nahin tha
 The servants were also not involved in this and circumstantial evidence indicates that whatever happened, only the parents did it
 haalanki talwaar danpati kii vakil rebeka jon ne kaha ki is faisle ko khaarij karaane ke liye upree adaalat main dastak di jaaegi
 Rebecca, reacting to the court's order, said, "you guys (media) created such an atmosphere and everything happened
" unhone kaha, desh main kanoon kaa raaj he
 We will challenge this decision in a higher court
 yah antim faisla nahin he
 It can be challenged
 hamaare raste khule hai
 Talwar's lawyer Satish Tamta had alleged that the CBI investigation had several deficiencies
 unhone kaha tha, hamaara tark yah tha ki hamane jaanch main kai aisi kamiyaan saamne laane kii koshish kii, jinka spashtikaran jaruri he or jaanch is str par nahin roki ja sakati
 Further scientific investigation is necessary, so that proper results can be revealed
 tamata ne diene pareekshan kii jarurat par bhi bal diya tha
 Aarushi's parents, in their earlier petition filed in the court, alleged that the investigation has deliberately kept loopholes
 unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki is maamle main aage kii jaanch ke aadesh die jane chahie, taaki is jaghanya aparaadh main shaamil aparaadhiyon ko pakadaa ja sake or unhen kanoon kii jad main laayaa jaae
