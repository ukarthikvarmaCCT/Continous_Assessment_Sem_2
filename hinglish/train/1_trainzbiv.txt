 Ladies and Gentleman, this morning of Good Morning Delhi is very special for me

 Welcome to the 12th India Today Conclave
 pichley 11 saalon main desh main kai bade badlaav hue
 But i am sure that you must also believe that India is not just one country
 balki yah duniya kaa sabase bada loktantr he jahaan teji se badlaav ho rahe hai
 As a nation, we have surprised everyone, where the best and worst trends of democracy exist simultaneously
 hamaare jaise khabaron kii duniya ke logon ke liye har pal romaanch se bharpoor rahaa
 But how it was for the country is difficult to say
 pichley 11 saal se lagaataar yojit kiye ja rahe india today conkalev main 21 veen sadi main lokatrant ke vikaas or samay ke saath badalte ahm muddon par vichaar hota rahaa he
 This year also the Conclave will continue to discuss the changing dimensions of democracy with eminent speakers
 is saal kii theme he: rienvinting demokrasi (reinventing Democracy)
 There could be no better topic than this for democracy and in the era of struggle within democracy
 21 veen sadi main madhya purv main loktantr ke liye dardanaak ladaai or arab main loktantr kii ladaai ne chetavanee de di ki loktantric swatantraaa chaah behad sankramak he
 This struggle for democracy is not over yet and even in the spring of the season of romance, democracy still does not have complete independence
 libya or syria main khun abhi bhi bahaae ja rahe hai or puri duniya dekh rahi he
 Even after dictatorship in Egypt, life in democracy is not better
 yah ek sach he ki loktantr ke liye sangharsh se kahin zyada mushkil he loktantric vyavastha ko kaayam rakhana
 While the struggle for democracy continues in the world, the world's major democracies are going through a period of crisis
 europe main sarkarein ekal mudra ko patan se bachaane or apni arthvyavasthaaon ko punerjeevit ke liye prayasarat hai
 On the other hand, despite changing the government 5 times in the last 4 years in Japan, the country's economic stability is disastrous
 bharat ke loktantr main bhi pareekshan kaa daur jari he
 On the one hand, the politician is the target of the general public
 sarkaron ke aniatik or ruukhe vyavhaar se naaraaz ho jan adaalat sadak utar ai he
 Weak political leadership is damaging the economy
 desh main vikaas dar pichley 10 saal ke sabase nichle staar par pahunch gai he
 Today two big economists will give their opinion on this issue
 do dinon tak chalane vaale is conkalev main lokatrant ke badalte pariprekshya par bahes kii ye koshish apane aap main anuthi he
 Former President and Missile Man Dr
 Abdul Kalam, who has the power to take the image of India to the seventh sky all over the world, will give an impartial opinion in this conclave on democracy and defense needs
 desh nirmaan main sena kii bhoomika par charchaa karne ke liye sena pramukh general bikram singh kii maujuudagi or unki raay bhi is conklev main khaas hogi
 Apart from these, the presence of Praful Patel, John Frederick Baxas and Chris Gopi Krishnan to discuss the growing market in India will be special
 bharat ke badalte raajnneetik parivesh par charchaa ke liye namo nam mantra kitna kargar hone vaala he, is par charchaa ke liye gujarat ke mukhya mantri narendra modi kii maujuudagi or unke vichaar nishchit hi raajnneeti kii disha tay karne vaale honge
 In the end, democracy is as good as the people who have got the mandate to handle it
 yahi kaaran he ki loktantr main sankat ke saath-saath netritv kaa sankat bhi dikh rahaa he
 Despite this, the best thing democracy gives you and me is hope
 loktantr ek paudhe ke samaan he jisaki lagaataar dekhbhaal kiye jane kii zarurat he
 The Conclave is also part of the same process and when so many celebrities are together on one stage, the dreams of 21st century India will surely come true
 ladies and jentalman, demokrasi kaa matlab "janata kaa shashan" he
 Only in this we can bring some newness
 ummid he ki nai soch or nai disha ke saath do din tak chalane vaale is conklev ko pasand karenge

 ' vijayawargeey ne kaha, 'ham pakistan se bharat ke sambandh sudhaarna chaahate hai

 ' Reversing the criticism of the Congress over Modi's visit to Pakistan, the BJP general secretary said, 'I am sorry that the Congress is not worried about the national interest
 modi kii auchak pakistan yatra ko sakaaratmak nazariye se dekha janaa chahie
 "he said," Cross-border terrorism had increased in India after the visit of the then Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to Pakistan
 vaise yah aane vaala vakt hi batayega ki bataur pradhanmantri rajeev or modi main kya antar he
 Vijayvargiya said, 'we want to improve India's relations with Pakistan
 agar aisa nahin hota he, to ham har sthiti se nipatane ko taiyaar bhi hai
 ' jab kendriya bajet aayaa tha to us vakt smriti irani kii aguai vaale soochna or prasaaran (ibi) mantralay ne 'bajet' par kendrit online live charchaaon kii saath-saath monitering kii thi
 In addition to the social media platforms Twitter and Facebook, a team went through a lot of blogs
 unke vishleshan ke aadhaar par vitt mantri arun jetali ne janaa ki kuch bajtiy praavdhaanon par logon main gussa he or unhone use dur karne kii koshish bhi kii thi
 For example, the analysis showed that people were very angry with Jaitley because there was no change in the tax slab on personal income
 natijatan vitt mantri ne vetanbhogiyon ke liye 40,000 ru
 The provision of a standard deduction (standard deduction) was re-enacted
 haalanki yah praavdhaan naganya tha par isane logon ke gusse ko thodaa shant kiya
 Now that the general elections have less than a year left, excited by the experiment, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has planned to set up a 'social media communication hub'
 isamen desh ke sabhi 716 jilon main logon ko anubandh par rakhkar centre kii yojanaon par logon kii pratikriya or sujhaavon par najar rakhane kii koshish hogi
 According to officials, people working on this scheme will become the 'eyes and ears' of the government and will report to the government on social media as well as mainstream media, keeping a close watch on the news of newspapers, TV and radio stations
 sarkaar ne iske liye logon ko kaam par rakhane kii manjuuri is saal farvari main hi de di thi
 Under this, one for each district and about 20 people in Delhi have been hired
 ve rojaanaa kam se kam chah report taiyaar karenge
 The government has raised Rs 17 crore for this hub
 manjuur kiye hai
 Broadcast Engineering Consultants India Limited under the ministry has also floated a tender for the supply of software for this project
 uske dastavej main kaha gaya he ki software sabhi digital channelon ke bich saamanjasy banane ke liye computerikrut repotrs, nitigat nirikshan or vyapak kaary pragati main sakasham hona chahie, saath hi isamen soochnaaon ko prasaarit karne kii suvidha bhi honi chahie
 It added that the new tool should be able to 'listen' and respond on Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, linkedin, youtube, Instagram and 'google Playstore, Email, News, Blogs, Compliant Sites and Forums'
 isse 'real-time new media cmand room' banaaya ja sakegaa
 Cyber security experts say that the language of this tender is in violation of the IT Act 2000
 masalan, 'email ko sunanaa' yaa padhuya-dekhnaa bina email khatadharak kii anumati ke sambhav nahin
 Cyber security expert Subimal Bhattacharjee says, "monitoring of content on other platforms requires the permission of entities such as Facebook or Google, but they cannot be compelled to do so unless the court orders it
" ''ve centre kii 2009 kii ek adhisuchana kaa hawala dete hai jo sarkaar ko vishesh paristhitiyon main or ek niyat samay ke liye hi online content kii nigaraanee kii anumati detaa he jiske liye kai prakaar kii anumati bhi lene kii jarurat hogi
 The bid documents say that the software should be able to monitor the emerging trends of social media and the world wave web and be able to anticipate the feelings of people who are active on the Internet
 software kii in jaruraton se sarkaar ke iraadon ko bhampa ja saktaa he
 This tool can prove to be a 'guiding tool' in understanding the impact of the government's social media campaign
 yah koi nayaa vichaar nahin he
 The current social media analytics wing of the ministry examines incoming posts on social media and produces reports for ministries like the Prime Minister's Office, the National Security Advisory Office, intelligence agencies, and home and defense
 yah wing ek aisa software prayog karata he jo prati ghante chaar karod pej kii baarik padtaal kar saktaa he
 National security is a subject but what about privacy and personal freedom? Such questions remain unanswered

 chhattisgarh main congress kaa 15 saal kaa vanvaas khatm ho gaya he
 The Congress has won the state with a thumping majority and Raman Singh's dream of becoming Chief Minister for the fourth consecutive time has been broken
 rajya kii marvaahee seat se janata congress chhattisgarh ke pramukh or purv mukhyamantri ajit jogi ne 46462 voton se jeet darj kii
 Ajit Jogi has got a total of 74041 votes
 vahiin, BJP kii archana ko 27579 vot mili hai
 Marwahi seat is considered traditional of Jogi family
 madhya pradesh ke samay se hi ye seat kaaphi charchit seat rahi he, ajit jogi ne yaheen se jitkar chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri banane kaa gaurav hasil kiya tha
 Marwahi Assembly constituency in Bilaspur district is bordering Madhya Pradesh
 adivasee samudaay ke liye arakshit he
 Another specialty of this assembly constituency is that it is also known for defective leaders
 marvaahee kii khaasiyatye ilaaka ghaney jangalon se ghira hua he
 The forest is spread in about one and a half million hectares
 bhaaluon ke liye bhi ye ilaaka kaaphi mashhoor he
 Rare white bears are also found in this area, but now these bears have become the biggest problem here
 bhaaluu yahaan kii sabase badi samasyajungal main rahane vaale graminon par lagaataar bhaaluu ke hamale kii khabar aati rahati hai
 Jogi had announced to run Operation Jamwant to deal with this problem while being the Chief Minister, but this plan was also lost as soon as Jogi left
 yahi vajah he ki har chunaav main yahaan duusare muddon ke saath bhaaluu bhi ek bada mudda hota he
 In 2013, there were 11 candidates in the fray for the 2013 assembly election seat
 congress se amit jogi ne pita kii viraasat ko bachaane main hi nahin balki record maton se jeetne main kaamyaab rahe the
 Amit Jogi received 82 thousand 909 votes

 The remaining candidates could not even save their bail

 bjp's Dhyan Singh Parote received 25431 votes
 2003 ke vidhansabha chunaavcongress ke ajit jogi ko 76269 ko vot mili the
 bjp's Nand Kumar Sai got 22119 votes
 marvaahee dalbadalu vidhayakon kaa varchasvamarvahee seat kii kahani dilachasp he
 This has been the area of defected mlas
 isaki shuruuaat bade adivasee netaa bhavar singh porte se hi ho jaati he, jinhone 1972 ,1977 or 1980 ke chunaav jeet kar hetric lagaai
 In 1985, the party cut his ticket and became Deendayal MLA of Congress
 bhavar singh naaraaz hokar congress chhod di or bijepi kaa daaman tham liya or 1990 main vidhayak bane
 In 1993 BJP again cut his ticket and Congress wrestler Singh Marawi became MLA from this seat
 aise banaajogi kagarh2001 ke baad se ye vidhansabha jogi kii hokar rah gai
 Ajit Jogi continued to be an MLA from 2003 to 2008
 2013 main amit jogi ne is seat ko chhod diya tha
 Now Amit is leaving the seat for his father in 2018
 raajnneetik itihaas bataata he ki yahaan se bhale hi do baar bijepi ke vidhayak bane hai, lekin isaki taasir congressi hi he
 However, Amit Jogi believes that it is not Jogi's stronghold, but of Congress
 bilaspur se 150 kilometre dur marvaahee kii pidaa ye he ki yahaan kaa adivasee, vikaas to dur apane jila mukhyalay se bhi itani dur he, jahaan tak pahunchane kii himmat nahin juta paata
 So neither they get information about government schemes nor they are implemented properly
 natijatan ye pichhadaa ilaaka or pichhadta ja rahaa he

 The All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi (asaduddin owaisi) on Tuesday criticized the statement of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat in which he termed mob lynching as defaming India
 mohan bhavgat ne kaha tha ki bheed hatya (linching) ‘pashchimi tarika' he or desh ko badnaam karne ke liye iskaa bharat ke pariprekshya main istemaal nahin karnaa chahie
 AIMIM leader Owaisi said the 'victims of mob killing are Indians'

 We have Godse lover BJP mps
 ' ovaisi ne twit kiya ki gandhi or tabarez ansaari kii hatya jis vichaardhaara ne kii uski tulana main bharat kii badi badanaami or koi kuch nahin ho sakati

 islam dharm ke tahat do id manaai jaati hai
 Muslims celebrate Eid with Hindustan in all countries of the world
 ramajaan ke baad id-ul fitar manaai jaati he or uske 70 din baad id-ul juha kaa mauka aata he, jise bakreed bhi kehete hai
 On the occasion of Bakrid, people of the Muslim community perform Namaz
 saath hi jaanwaron kii qurbaani di jaati he
 According to Islamic belief, which began in the time of Prophet Abraham, 1 lakh 24 thousand Prophet (messenger) came into the world
 inamen ek paigambar hazrat ibrahim hue
 It was in these times that Bakrid started
 ye he puraa valkyislamic jaankaar bataate hai ki ek baar allaah ne hazrat ibrahim ko sapane main apni sabase pyaari cheez ko qurbaan karne kaa hukum diya
 Hazrat Ibrahim was born to Aulad Naseeb at the age of 80
 aise main unke liye sabase pyaare unke bete hazrat ismil hi the
 It was a tough test for him to fulfill the command of Allah
 ek taraf allaah kaa hukum tha to duusari taraf bete kii muhabbat
 In such a situation, they obeyed Allah and agreed to sacrifice the son for the sake of Allah
 islam ke jaankaar moulana hamid nomani bataate hai ki hazrat ibrahim ko laga ki bete kii qurbaani dete samay unka pyaar kahin aade naa aa jaae
 So they blindfolded themselves
 iske baad hazrat ibrahim ne jab bete ismil kii gardan kaatane ke liye churi chalaai to allaah ke hukum se ismil alaihissalam kii jagah ek dumba (ek jaanavar) pesh kar diya gaya
 When Ibrahim Alaihissalam removed the blindfold, he found his son standing in front of him
 allaah ko hazrat ibrahim kaa ye akida itnaa pasand aayaa ki har sahibe haisiyat(jisaki aarthik haalat bakra yaa doosraa jaanavar kharidkar qurbaan karne kii ho) par qurbaani karnaa vaazib kar diya
 Islamic religious leader Mufti Shamoon Qasmi says that the message that Allah gave to Hazrat Ibrahim was only trying them out
 taaki ye sandesh diya ja sake ki allaah ke farmaan ke liye musalmaan apana sab kuch qurbaan kar sake
 The sons cannot be sacrificed
 When it was asked to Hameed Nomani, if it was customary to sacrifice the boys on the occasion of Bakrid, if Hazrat Ibrahim's knives were to walk on the neck of Hazrat Ismail? To this Maulana Nomani replied that no, it does not happen at all
 unhone bataaya ki hazrat ibrahim ko bete kii qurbaani kaa khwaal sirf isliye aayaa kyonki allaah unki aajamaaish ke jariye ye sandesh dene chaahate the ki uski raah main har cheez qurbaan kii ja sakati he
 That is, no such condition can ever be made in which the custom of sacrificing boys begins

 Along with this, the regulator has also sought fresh ideas about the 700 mhz band evaluation system

 The regulator in its consultation paper has asked the partners where the upcoming auction should take place

 sioeai kaa kahana he ki 2019 shaayad 5ji nilaamee ke liye‘uchit’samay hoga
 COAI Director General Rajan Mathews said that it is very important to have a clear framework for spectrum auction but the big question is also when the auction will take place and how the entire strategy will be related to the new telecom policy that the Department of Telecommunications is preparing

 The opposition has united to win RLD candidate Tabassum Hasan on the lines of gorakhpur-phulpur to defeat the BJP in the Kairana Lok Sabha by-election
 tabassum kaa muqabla bijepi ke divangat saansad hukum singh kii beti mriganka singh se he
 However, Tabassum's path is not easy in this election war, as his own people have laid thorns in his path
 parivaar se hi chunautiareldi ummidavaar tabassum hasan ke khilaaf sapa, basapa or congress ne koi ummidavaar nahin utaara he, lekin unki raah main sabase bada roda unke hi devar kanvar hasan hai
 Kanwar Hasan is a candidate from Lok Dal
 iske alaava tabassum ke duusare devar kairana se nagar palika adhyaksh anwar hasan bhi unke khilaaf prachaar kar rahe hai
 There is a lot of resentment among a section of Muslims about Wasim Chaudhary, the brother of Tabassum Hasan
 kaha ja rahaa he ki kanvar hasan ke utarane ke peeche congress netaa imran masood kaa haath he
 Imran Masood's brother Salman Baqeda is also seeking votes for Kanwar Hasan
 gorakhpur-phulpur jaisaa ekajute nahin he vipakshkairana seat par vipaksh kii ore se areldi ne tabassum hasan ko ummidavaar banaaya he, lekin jis prakaar gorakhpur or phulpur upachunaav main bijepi ke khilaaf vipaksh ekajute hokar maidan main utraa tha, vaisaa najaara yahaan nahin dikh rahaa he
 In Gorakhpur and Phulpur, the outstanding candidates were seen seeking votes for the SP candidate
 sapa ke kuch netaa bhale hi kairana main dikh rahe hai, lekin basapa netaa kuch bolne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 sp's Mulvot Yadav voters are very few in this Lok Sabha seat
 vahiin, basapa-congress alaakaman kii ore se bhi prachaar ko lekar abhi tak koi elaan nahin hua he
 No leader from both parties has entered the election campaign so far
 iske chalate kaaryakarta bhi khamosh hai
 Naresh Jatav, a BSP worker from Nakur assembly constituency, says that the order will come from the party
 philhal kuch kaha nahin gaya he
 So Congress workers are sitting at home
 imran masood isi sansadeey seat se aate hai
 He did not enter the election campaign even one day
 masood kehete hai ki party line se hatakar koi kaam nahin karuunga, jo alaakaman kaa aadesh hoga, uskaa paalan karuunga
 It is known that only five days are left in the campaign for the by-election in Kairana
 jaaton kaa nahin pigal rahaa dilamujaffarnagar dange kii aanch abhi logon ke andar dadhak rahi he
 The distance between the Jats and the Muslims has not completely widened
 haalanki tabassum hasan areldi se ummidavaar hai, lekin iske baavjood jat samudaay kaa dil jeet paane main safal hoti nahin dikh rahi hai
 While the Yogi government is preparing to withdraw the case from the accused in the Muzaffarnagar riots to help the Jats
 kairana chunaav membijapike liye ye trump card sabit ho saktaa he
 There is also a continuous attempt to convert the political situation of Hindu vs
 Muslim election elections to Hindu vs
 Muslim
 kairana ke 17 lakh matadaataaon main se paanch lakh muslim hai
 Yogi government's two ministers from the same region are Suresh Rana and Dharam Singh Saini
 suresh rana jahaan hindutv kaa cheharaa hai, to vahiin dharm singh saini hindu or muslim donon samudaayon main paith rakhte hai
 He has a Gurjar community with BJP candidate Mriganka Singh
 iske alaava jat, rajput or saini vot bhi mriganka kii takat hai
 The Jatav voters are waiting for the decree of the BSP high command, while Mriganka Singh is seen breaching Muslim votes

 dilli kii sabase bhavy ramlila manchan ke liye pahchaan rakhane vaali lav-kush ramlila main pahunche bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah or film abhinayta jon abraham ek saath manch saajha karte najar aae
 Speaking on the occasion, John said that he wants to play the role of Ravana
 dilachasp baat yah rahi ki jab jon abraham se lav-kush kamity ke sadsy ne poocha ki mauka milane par wo ramlila ke kis kirdaar main najar aane chahenge, tab jon ne kaha ki ravan bhagwaan shiv ke bade bhakt the or khud wo bhi bholenath ko bahut maanate hai isliye mauka milane par wo ravan kaa role hi adaa karnaa chahenge
 Film actor John Abraham also promoted his upcoming film 'atomic' from the stage of Ramlila, the story of the nuclear test in Pokhran, which will be released soon on the big screen
 jon ne bataaya ki abtak ke itihaas main parmaanu bam tabaahi ke liye janaa jaataa he
 While part of the film's story is about better use of atoms
 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne lav-kush ramlila ke aayojakon ko satya kaa sandesh pahunchane ke liye shubhakamanaayen di
 Amit Shah said that it is the day to remember Satya's victory over untruth
 ramlila kaa yah manch satyamev jayate ke sandesh ko har jagah pahunchaate rahegaa
 After this, Amit Shah and film actor John Abraham burnt Ravana by shooting arrows from the stage of love-kush Ramlila
 jon kii film 'parmaanu: da story of pokharan' kaa first luk relizebta den ki dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kii bhi charchaa lav-kush ramlila main aane kii thi, haalanki wo manch par najar nahin aae
 The Bihar Legislative Assembly is to be elected next year and when elections are to be held in many other states before that, in that context, the prediction about the Bihar Assembly elections will be hasty but the only indications are clear from the indications that are being received, and that Nitish Kumar is again elected as the Chief Minister
 khaskar is kathan ko bal bihar kii rajdhani patna main pichley dinon teen alag-alag ghatnaon se mila
 They had no relation with each other but they all had one political meaning
 pehla maamla he patna stesan kaa jahaan par lalu yadav ke shashan main shuru kiya gaya doodh market todakar samtal kar diya gaya
 At night, Tejashwi Yadav rushed to protest but then finished his picket in a few hours
 yah market yadavon ke, khaskar lalu yadav or unki party kaa bihar kii satta par pakad or hanak kii pahchaan tha
 Just a few hundred meters from this area is the house of BJP MP Ramkripal Yadav
 lekin ve to apane ghar se nikle bhi nahin
 Which shows that not only the lalu-tejashwi-ramkripal Yadav era has come to an end but they are no longer left with such political power that they could do something when a milk market, which was being held by the honor of the Yadav society, was being frozen
 haalanki is market ko jab bhi patna stesan ke saundaryikaran ke naam par todane kii koshish hoti thi tab lalu yadav apane prabhaav kaa istemaal kar rukvaa lete the
 In the second case, the newly appointed Governor of Bihar Fagu Chauhan attended a function organized under the banner of Beldar Kanu Mahasangh, Nonia, one of the most backward castes of the BJP
 rajbhavan se vishesh rup se media waalon ko phone kiya gaya ki kawarej karen
 In this program, all the leaders of Bihar BJP were present on the stage
 nishchit rup se bhaajapa ne rajyapal ko is manch par bulaakar koi acchhee parampara kii shuruyaat nahin kii lekin uski pareshaani he ki tamaam prayaason ke baavjood samaaj ke is varg main vah mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii paith kaa kaat nahin dhund pai he
 And she knows that as long as Nitish has the confidence of this class, the change in power in Bihar can be a matter of debate but it will not have an impact at the top of power
 bakaul bihar bhaajapa ke netaa jis prakaar nitish kumaar ne ati pichde ke liye ab tak puure bihar main teen seat mujaffarpur , jhanjharpur or supaul se is baar katihaar or jahanabad tak se is samudaay ke andar aane vaali jatiyon ke logon ko sansad sadsy banane kaa mauka diya uske baad maatr jati ke sammelan main rajyapal ko khadaa kar dene se daal nahin galane vaali
 Perhaps the RJD is aware of this reality apart from the BJP, so when Tejashwi Yadav goes to his new house, the first meeting of the most backward community takes place there
 unki jubaan par ab samaaj ke ati pichde samudaay ko party or tikat main hissedari dena he
 But the leaders of the RJD also believe that Lalu Tejaswi has lost a lot of time in the campaign to connect these backward castes and understand their importance in the politics of Bihar
 iske riselt ke liye agle saal ke vidhansabha chunaav main ummid karnaa bekaar he, isiilie unhen 2025 tak intjaar karnaa hoga
 At the same time, Nitish's party starts putting up posters for the assembly elections, then BJP leader Sushil Modi advises that there is no doubt on leadership in NDA, time is in the election
 unka matlab nitish kumaar or unke samarthakon se hi hoga ki vikaas ke kaam par dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahie
 Sushil Modi is well aware that if the current NDA Assembly elections in Bihar are fought simultaneously, the issue of debate will be whether the record of his victory in 206 seats in 2010 and how many more seats will be broken, because NDA and Grand Alliance in Bihar The vote gap between now is more than twenty percent, which at the moment does not have the ability to bridge the newbie in politics and arrogant Tejashwi Yadav in practice
 Land
 nitish ko satta main waapas aane se rokane main tejasvi isliye bhi fail rahenge kyonki jab unke pita lalu yadav 2010 main ramvilas paswan ke saath maidan main the tab unki party 22 siton par simatakar rah gai thi
 And when Paswan is no longer with him, the common sense tells us that the NDA seats will increase and the RJD will win less than 22 seats
 vaise bhi loksabhaa chunaav main jab aap vidhansabha waar siton par jeet kaa antar dekhenge to tejasvi yadav keval soshal media par sakriy hokar uski bharpai nahin kar sakate hai
 The ground truth is that after the Lok Sabha elections, like the whole country, the popularity of the BJP in Bihar and the voters has increased
 iskaa ek kaaran kashmir ke kiye dhara 370 ko khatm karnaa he
 After this decision, the Kashmiri people may be facing problems, but a large section in this country is happy about it
 yah endie ke kor voter hai or nitish is jamini sachai se bhaleebhanti parichit hai isliye unki party ne loksabhaa or rajyasabha main token virodh kar baad main nae kanoon kaa danke par samarthan kar diya
 This is a sign that Nitish is now at stake for his ideology
 vaise bhi nitish ek accidental samaajawaadee hai jo apane siddhant ko samay-samay par nae tareeke se paribhaashit karte hai
 Therefore, through its leaders on the issues will definitely keep the party's opinion, as happened on the NRC issue, but it will not be overstated
 aane vaale samay main agar ram mandir ke maamle main sarvocch nyaayalay kaa faisla mandir banane ke paksh main aata he to agar pradhanmantri narendra modi chahenge to nitish mandir kaa eent jodne kii qatari main bhi khadey honge
 People forget that during the Lok Sabha elections, Nitish Kumar and his party were one of the few parties in the country that did not issue their manifesto because the BJP would have been troubled by it
 nitish ne kisi media waalon ko intervyuu nahin diya ki ve unase vah sawaal karenge jis par unke jawaab se bhaajapa ko safaai deni hoti
 It is a different matter that after the election results of the same Nitish Kumar, the BJP was forced to return empty-handed, meaning without giving him any place of interest in the Union Cabinet
 or yahi nai bhaajapa he jiske liye nitish jitne kadam apni raajnneeti main peeche rakhen lekin ab kii bhaajapa apane fizback ke aadhaar par akalan karti he or vaise hi aapako bhav detii he
 The biggest suspense about Bihar's next assembly election is whether BJP will try to form a government on its own
 iskaa aadhaar yahi he ki aane vaale kuch maheenon main bagal ke jharkhand main bhaajapa apane balboote sarkaar banane ja rahi he
 And while in Bengal, it can replace the main opposition by polarizing voters
 Why not in Bihar
 lekin aisi maang karne waalon ko loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan amit shah kii patna main media waalon ko naseehat yaad rakhni chahie ki bihar main trikoniya raajnneeti ek sachai he or yahaan do se unka matlab bhaajapa or janata dal united se tha, ek saath aa gaye to tisare kaa durgati tay he
 The problem is who will be the face in front of Nitish and the other BJP leaders believe that if Nitish comes to victory again, he can make it difficult for the BJP in the politics of the whole country
 lekin nitish or bhaajapa donon ko satta main ek-duusare ke saath jo comfort he vah kisi or dal or gathbandhan main donon ko nahin mil saktaa
 But BJP leaders also believe that a silent vote bank based on the work done by the people towards Nitish Kumar has increased with the completion of his promises
 ise nazarandaaz nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Nitish Kumar's biggest political enemy is neither the RJD nor the BJP, but his current mentality of 'thike hai' as per his own party poster
 mana jaataa he ki jo bhi is poster or naare ke peeche he vah nitish kumaar se bhaleebhanti parichit he
 And perhaps he got fed up with his personal experience or Nitish Kumar's behavior and chose the most appropriate word 'thike Hai'
 iske peeche nitish kumaar kaa vyavhaar he
 Now whether law or order, or development criticism, they do not consider feedback and do not take events as a challenge
 lekin unki sab kuch par yahi pratikriya hoti he thike he
 
 
 There is only one byte, who can stop the events
 yahi unki pratikriya hoti he
 Their own decisions, such as liquor ban, which is believed to be a daily bonus scheme for policemen from all over Bihar, have further corrupted the police system
 samaaj main ek samanaantar vyavastha kaayam hui he or sarkari khazaane ko apni zid main nitish ne har saal chapat lagaai
 How successful this scheme of Nitish is, you will get an idea of the revenue from the excise of Jharkhand and Bengal in the next
 lekin uske baavjood unhone puure samaaj main aparaadhiyon kii ek nai fuj khadi kar di, lekin tab bhi sab thike he
 
 
 While liquor prohibition has increased the incidence of crime, especially murder, in Bihar, there is tap water in every house, pension for every old person, or free ration for Dalit or OBC students, all this There are schemes due to which, for the next year, Nitish's return to power for next year, his opponents also believe that there will be a formality
 or agar endie ekajute hokar ladaa to dekhnaa yah hoga ki koun party kitni siten talmail main paati he or kiskaa kitna strike rate hota he
 As far as the opposition is concerned, everyone's curiosity will be only in whether Tejashwi and Tej Pratap manage to save their seats
 vaise chunavi samikarnon ko dekhen yaa chunavi ankaganit ko, nitish kumaar philhal apane virodhiyon par har tarah se baari pad rahe hai
 The Shibu Soren government, which came in minority after the withdrawal of bjp's support in Jharkhand, decided to resign on Sunday night after it failed to muster the necessary support for a majority
 shibu sorain ne raat kareeb 10 baje rajyapal se mulaakaat kar unhen apana istipha saunp diya
 Earlier, Jharkhand Deputy Chief Minister and All Jharkhand Student Union (AJSU) President of Shibu Soren Government Sudesh Kumar Mahato told that all 25 mlas of the parties involved in the government had a meeting at his residence under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Shibu Soren
 Instead of facing a trust vote in the assembly, it was decided to resign from the government
 gyatavya he ki 24 may ko rajya kii gathbandhan sarkaar se 18 vidhayakon vaali bhaajapa ke samarthan vaapasi ke baad 82 sadasyeey vidhansabha main shibu sorain sarkaar ko sirf 25 vidhayakon kaa hi samarthan hasil rah gaya tha
 Due to this she was reduced to a minority
 rajyapal ne usee din shaam ko mukhyamantri ko talab kar 31 may tak vidhansabha main apana bahumat sabit karne kaa nirdesh diya tha
 As per the instructions of the Governor, the government convened a special session of the Assembly on 31 May, in which it was to prove its majority
 lekin saat dinon ke athak prayaas ke baavjood 14 vidhayakon vaali congress, 11 vidhayakon vaali jhavimo or apane puraane saathi bhaajapa se samarthan kii koi ummid naa dekhte hue sadan main kirakiri se bachane ke liye ‘guruji’ ne aakhirkaar istipha dene kaa faisla kiya

 yamuna nadi ke pani main ammonia kaa str badhane ke kaaran dilli main do jal sanyantron ko ravivaar ko band kar diya gaya
 Due to this, there may be water shortage in many places in the capital
 dilli jal bordake adhikariyon ke mutabik, madhya or uttari dilli ke alaava kaint ilaake ko pani supplai karne vaale chandraval or wazirabad sanyantr ko shanivaar aadhi raat ke baad band kar diya gaya
 Repair work is going on at the plant, but production is not expected to start till 7 am
 in adhikariyon kii maane to agar plant se production subah shuru bhi hota he, to somvaar shaam tak hi pani kii supplai saamaanya ho paaegi
 However, Delhi Kejal Minister Kapil Mishra says that water will be restored at 7 am on Monday
 lekin yahaan dhyaan dene vaali baat yah he ki pani ke production main 5 ghante kaa vaqt lagata he
 In such a situation, there is a possibility that the water crisis will continue for the people of Delhi on Monday morning
 jal sankat kaa dabl atake isliye bhi he, kyonki kanal se pani na aane kii haalat main yamuna se pani lekar plant main treet kiya jaataa he, lekin wazirabad plant main yamuna ke pani ko treet karnaa isliye mushkil he, kyonki ravivaar kii subah se hi yahaan ammonia kaa str lagaataar bad rahaa he
 Let us tell you that Delhi gets about 1000 cusecs of water daily from Haryana through a career-lined channel CLC and Kachchi Canal
 isamen se kareeb 650 kusek pani sielsi se or baaki 350 kusek pani kachi nahar se supplai hota he
 The water coming from CLC does not contain ammonia, whereas the water supplied from the raw canal is more likely to contain ammonia
 filhal 650 kusek vaali sielsi main damege or yamuna main badhate ammonia kii vajah se dilli jal board ke donon haath bandha gaye hai or desh kii rajdhani main jal sankat gaharaa gaya he
 Explain that the Wazirabad plant produces 120 MGD (million gallons) every day and the Chandrawal plant produces 93 MGD water, while the Okhla plant produces 20 MGD and the Dwarka plant produces 40 MGD water every day

 Rahul Chavan lived with his parents and brother on the fifth floor of the Sasubai building on Diva Dativali Road in Thane city
 pados main hi ek computernetwork company main kaam karne vaala kiran tambe rahata he
 It is said that Kiran was beating his wife, at the same time Rahul and his 6-year-old brother saw him
 kiran ne donon ko unke ghar ke saamne sejane ke liye kaha
 Rahul's family members felt that Kiran was assaulting his sons
 iske baad rahul ke gharavaalon or kiran tambe ke bich kahasuni hogai
 Kiran drank alcohol on Monday
 der shaam usne ghar ke baahar khel rahe rahul cobulayaa or paas kii dukaan se sharaab kii bottle laane ke liye kaha
 Rahul refused
 kiran tambe ko gussa aa gaya or kathith rup se usne pehle dhardarathiyaar se rahul ke gale par waar kiya or phir use paanchavi manzil se neeche phenkadia
 Rahul's brother Lucky told the whole thing to the family
 aspataal le jane paradactaron ne rahul ko mrit ghoshit kar diya
 There was an uproar in the building after the incident
 logon ne kiran ko pakadaney kii koshishki to usne vahiin se bagal kii imaarat par chalaang laga di or faraar ho gaya
 Kiran had a leg fracture while jumping
 rahul ke gharavaalon nepulice main maamla darj karaayaa jiske baad kiran tambe ko uski pehali patni kevikroli sthit ghar se giraftaar kar liya gaya
 In a country where half of the hospitalization is considered relief from illness
 jis desh main doctor babu ek baar nabj dekh len to hi aadhi beemaari khatm ho jaati ho, jis desh main aspataal kii choukhat par maut mil jaae to parijan khush rahete hai ki chalo aspataal tak to pahunchaa diya
 Only understand the unique truth of that country from the government data
 ek hajaar marijon par na to ek doctor na hi ek bed he
 At the same time, there is a nurse on two and a half thousand people
 ilaaj kisi desh main kamai kaa jariya ban chukaa he to vah bharat hi he
 The number of government hospitals in the country is 19817
 vahiin, privet aspataalon kii taadaad 80,671 he
 That is, the entire country rests on private hospitals for treatment
 ye sirf bade aspataalon kii taadaad bhar se hi nahin samajha ja saktaa
 Rather, the number of government primary health centers and community health centers in a country with six and a half lakh villages is only 29635
 jabaki nijee health centaron kii taadaad kareeb do lakh se zyada he
 Actually the public needs treatment and the government is not in a position to give treatment
 yaa kahen ilaaj ke liye sarkaar ne sabakuch nijee haathon main saunp diya he
 But the question is, how much does the government spend on citizens for treatment? So the government spends 92 rupees 33 paise per person per month
 halaat sirf is myne main gambhir nahin ki sarkaar behad kam kharch karti he
 The situation is a tragedy in the sense that one's life is someone's earnings
 2018-19 main desh kaa health bajet 52 hajaar karod kaa he, to privet health care kaa bajet kareeb 7 lakh karod kaa ho chalaa he
 The problem is that doctors now do not trust the government system
 kyonki desh main 90 fisadi doctor privet aspataalon main kaam karte hai
 According to the Indian Medical Council, there are a total of 10,22,859 registered allopathic doctors in the country
 inamen se sirf 1,13,328 doctor hi sarkari aspataalon main hai
 That is, make the government system sick and keep the private hospital alive for treatment, according to your pocket, then without shame you will have to say that the government is free of responsibility and the treatment for private health service is profitable and death is also profit

 purvanchal main incephelitis unmoolan kii disha main prayaas kar rahe bal rog visheshgy doctor aar en singh ne jei or eies se maut main kami ko ek badi uplabdhi bataate hue kaha ki sarkaar ne pichley saal rokthaam ko praathamikta dekar ‘dastak' abhiyaan chalaaya jisase mahamari ko rokane main kamyaabi mili he
 He said that it was controlled in Uttar Pradesh, but how will it be controlled in 17 states of the country including Bihar, West Bengal, Assam? a national program should be launched to eradicate it from the country
 singh ne kaha ki ‘neshnal program for privansion and control of incephelitis' varsh 2014 main hi banakar taiyaar ho chukaa he, lekin ise ab tak lagu nahin kiya gaya
 Had it been implemented, more than 130 children would not have died due to encephalitis in Bihar last may-june
 unhone kaha ki desh se polio or chechak kaa unmoolan sirf isaliye ho sakaa kyonki unke liye rashtriya kaarykram lagu kiya gaya tha
 If the encephalitis is to be eradicated from across the country, a national program will have to be implemented

 alagiri se jahaan chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa he
 At the same time, the changing political equations in the state are no less than any litmus test before him
 bataa den ki karunanidhi ne apane jite ji vico jaise apane vishwast party ke sipahsalaar ko peeche dhakel kar stallin ke liye raajnneetik jagah banaai
 But did not give full autonomy to Stalin and kept the veto
 lekin aaj unhen party kii kaman aupchaarik taur par saunpi ja rahi he
 Elder brother Alagiri was the biggest challenger Karunanidhi had to face in his life from the conflict between the successor Stalin and son MK Alagiri
 stallin ke virodh ke chalate karunanidhi ne 2014 main alaagiri ko party se party se nishkasit kar diya tha
 After Karunanidhi's death, Alagiri has stood as the biggest challenger against Stalin
 alaagiri ne 5 sitambar ko ek badi raily bulaai he
 With this rally, he can announce his future strategy
 alaagiri agar nai party banaate hai to unhen stallin ke virodhiyon kaa saath mil saktaa he
 In such a situation, Stalin could suffer a lot of damage in the southern state of Tamil Nadu
 alaagiri isiilie apane aapako karunanidhi ke uttaradhikari ke taur par pesh kar rahe hai
 The challenge to take Karunanidhi's legacy forward is the biggest challenge for Stalin to carry Karunanidhi's legacy forward
 karunanidhi bade-bade diggajon (jaise ki periyar ramasvami, sien annadurai, kamraj, emji ramchandran, si rajagopalaachari) ke bich jagah banane main kaamyaab hue the
 While Stalin has the biggest challenge to prove himself right now
 haalanki stallin ko karunanidhi ne netritv kaa platform pradaan kiya or karunanidhi ke bete hone se unhen party netaaon va kaaryakartaaon kaa sammaan bhi mil rahaa he, lekin party ko satta main laane kii sabase badi chunauti he
 The first examination of the leadership of the Lok Sabha and by-elections of 2019 is the 2019 Lok Sabha election
 stallin ke netritv main lade 2016 ke vidhansabha chunaav main party ko haar mili thi
 Earlier in 2011, the DMK lost power in the state and the party was defeated badly in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 is tarah se aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main party ko jitaane kii ek badi jimmedaari stallin ke kandhon par hogi
 It is not easy to win the election against the AIADMK only because of the anti-incumbency wave, as there are many political options in the state
 aise main stallin ko matadaataaon ke bich apni apil ko badhaane or unka bharosa jeetne kii sabase badi chunauti he
 The by-election will be the first examination of the leadership of Litmus Testalin will be held in Thiruparankandrum and Thiruvarur assembly seat before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 upachunaav jeetne ke alaava stallin ko party main varishton ke saath santulan karnaa hoga or unhen karunanidhi ke baad ek saath lekar chalane kii chunauti he
 Political analysts say a victory in the by-election will be Stalin's answer to critics within and outside the party

 donon abhinaytaon ke achche khaase fain hai, jinke bharose ve raajnneeti main apni jagah banane kii koshish main hai
 Many actors have also taken advantage of their stardom in South politics
 aise main stallin ke saamne camel hasan or rajnikant ek badi chunauti khadi kar sakate hai
 In the politics of making BJP entry, the BJP has no special support base in Tamil Nadu
 iske baavjood bijepi ne rajya main ummiden nahin chodi he
 BJP wants to establish its roots in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections through an alliance
 isi ke maddenjar pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh kai baar rajya kaa daura kar chuke hai
 During Karunanidhi's illness, Modi went to see him and also reached the funeral after his death
 iske alaava jayalalita ke nidhan ke baad ediemke main jis tarah se raajnneetik uthal puthal hui he
 BJP has got hope from that
 bijepi ke paas rajnikant bhi ek vikalp ke rup main hai
 Apart from this, BJP has a strong face like Modi
 ye diemke ke liye badi chunauti he
 How will Stalin manipulate? Karunanidhi was an expert in political manipulation
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki kabhi congress to kabhi bijepi se gathbandhan kar lete the, vaisaa anubhav stallin ko nahin he
 They have not aligned with any other party so far
 congress ke saath unka gathbandhan he
 Most of Stalin's advisors are also professionals with no experience of political overthrow

 Terming the abolition of special status of Jammu and Kashmir as a "milestone" for the unity of the country, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Friday accused the Congress of not taking this step in the "greed of vote bank"
 shah ne kaha ki chif aaf dephence staff (sidies) kaa pad srujit karne ke bare main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii swatantraaa diwas par kii gai ghoshnaa desh kii raksha ko kai guna majbootee pradaan karegi
 Shah, addressing a public meeting in Jat community stronghold Jind before the Haryana Assembly elections, gave the example of local veteran Birendra Singh, who left the Congress five years ago and came to the party, and in doing so he seemed to inspire others
 unhone kaha ki bijpi main shaamil hone vaale achche logon kaa swaagat or sammaan kiya jayega
 He predicted a two-thirds majority for the party in a possible assembly election in October
 shah ne kaha ki samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 ke tahat jammu kashmir ko praapt vishesh darje ko samaapt karne se kshetra ko aatankwaad mukt banane main madad milegi
 He said that Modi government abolished the special status of Jammu and Kashmir within 75 days of coming to power in its second term, whereas the previous Congress-led governments could not do it in '72 years'
 unhone iske liye us party ke 'vot bank ke laalach' ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 He said, 'abolition of most of the provisions of Article 370 and Article 35A is a milestone for India's unity and integrity

 BJP and BSP leaders are meeting about the by-election
 vahiin, sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav videsh se lautne ke baad sakriy ho gaye hai
 There is speculation that Dimple Yadav, who lost the election from Kannauj Lok Sabha seat in this by-election, is going to enter the by-election? Azam Khan, considered the SP leader and the Muslim face of the party, has been elected MP from Rampur parliamentary seat this time
 , After which he has resigned from the post of MLA
 iske chalate rampur vidhansabha seat rikt ho gai he, jahaan upachunaav hona he
 If sources are to be believed, Azam Khan wants to contest Dimple Yadav, wife of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav from his Rampur assembly seat
 iske liye unhone baqayda sapa adhyaksh ko prastaav diya he
 However, Akhilesh Yadav has not agreed to this yet
 jabaki dimple ko ajam khan jitaane kii puri guarantee le rahe hai
 It is discussed that the BJP can once again place a bet on Jayaprada in the Rampur assembly
 isi sambhaavna ko dekhte ajam khan ne dimple yadav ko chunavi ran main utaarne kaa man banaaya he taaki bijepi ko karaari maat dekar wo apane varchasv ko rampur main kaayam rakh sake
 This time Dimple Yadav has lost the election from Kannauj parliamentary seat
 unhen bijepi ke subrat pathak ne chunaav haraaya he
 At the same time, Akhilesh Yadav has reached Parliament by winning from Azamgarh seat
 aglaa loksabhaa chunaav paanch saal baad he
 In such a situation, Dimple Yadav can lead the party in the UP Assembly if she wins the assembly elections
 rampur vidhansabha seat ke siyaasi sameekaran bhi sapa ke paksh main he
 This seat is considered as the traditional of Azam Khan, from here it has been registering election victory from this seat since 1980
 ajam khan ko rampur main pehali or aakhri haar 1996 ke vidhansabha chunaav main mili thi
 Barring this election, Azam Khan has been consistently elected MLA from Rampur assembly seat since 1980
 sutron kii maane to yahi vajah he ki ajam khan apni paramparaagat vidhansabha seat se dimple yadav ko chunaav maidan main utaarna chaahate hai
 However, some party leaders do not want Dipal Yadav to contest from Rampur seat
 unhen lagata he ki agar dimple yadav rampur se chunaav ladati hai or jeet darj karne main kaamyaab rahati hai to iskaa shrey ajam khan ko jayega or party main unka kad or bhi bad jayega

 aish kii is kambek film ke ek event ke dauraan unhone aishwarya ke saath tasviir khinchane se manaa kar diya tha
 Ash was taken aback at this
 'i dil he mushkil' ke baad is film main special role main dikhengi aishwarya raay bachchanwahin, film 'lefti' ek science fiction he jisamen abhishek bachchan ek left handed super power paane vaale ladke kii bhoomika main hai jo shahar ko museebaton se bachaata he
 Earlier, Abhishek was seen in the film 'housefull 3'
 bihar main sattadhari jediu or argedy gathbandhan main jari siyaasi khinchataan ke bich nitish kumaar ne aaj mukhyamantri pad se istipha saunp diya
 Thus ended his fourth term as the Chief Minister of Bihar
 pehali baar 7 din baad hi dena padaa istiphanithish kumaar ko sabase pehle saal 2000 ke march main mukhyamantri kii kursi mili thi
 Nitish was then the Minister of Agriculture in the NDA government at the Center and formed the first government in the state on 3 March with BJP support
 haalanki tab unke paas paryaapt sankhyabal nahin tha or is tarah mahaj 7 din baad hi 10 march 2000 ko unhen pad seistifadena padaa tha
 Then again, he was elected twice in a row, followed by Nitish Kumar, who won the election in alliance with BJP in 2005 and once again came to the cm's chair on 24 November
 bijepi ke saath unka gathbandhan behad hi sahaj tareeke se chalata rahaa or is dauraan unhone lagaataar do chunaav main shandaar pradarshan karte hue sarkaar gathan kiya
 However, Nitish Kumar parted ways with BJP in protest against bjp's announcement of Narendra Modi as nda's Prime Ministerial candidate
 iske baad hue loksabhaa chunaav main jab jediu kii durgati hui tab ek baar phir nitish ne isaki naitik jimmedaari lete hue siem pad se istipha de diya or jeethanram maanjhi ko kursi par bitha diya
 The grand alliance of Modi protests could not last for two years, after this, in the Bihar assembly elections, he got a strong majority by having a grand alliance with RJD and Congress
 tab is jeet ko centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ko rokane kaa rambaan mana gaya or aage ke chunaavon main bhi aisi hi ranneeti banane kii vakaalat kii jane lagi
 However, this mahagathamban, which was uncomfortable from the beginning, could not last even two years and Nitish Kumar once again resigned from the post of CM citing morality
 srilanka ke captain kumaar sangakaara ne somvaar ko kaha ki tej gendbaaj dhammika prasad bharat ke khilaaf mangalvaar ko se shuru hone vaale duusare test match main nahin khelenge lekin rahasyamayi spinner ajanta mendis ko is match main mauka diye jane kii puri sambhaavna he
 Prasad took valuable wickets of VVS Laxman and Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the first Test match in Ahmedabad but was pulled in the vein below his knee and Sangakkara said the team is not considering the name of this 26-year-old left-arm fast bowler
 However, this is not the case with Tillakaratne Dilshan, who is running in form, who had a broken nose while playing football yesterday
 sangakaara ne kaha, 'dilashaan kii naak tut gayi thi lekin ab vah acha mahasoos kar rahaa he
 Dhammika's nerve was pulled but her recovery is good
 ham haalanki abhi unke naam par vichaar nahin kar rahe hai
 Muthiah Muralitharan took over the spin department with Rangana Herath in Ahmedabad but did not achieve much success and Sangakkara said Mendis could be included in the playing XI
 unhone kaha 'ajanta hameshaa hamaari ranneeti kaa hissaa rahaa he
 Given the confidence and balance in our team, we can play with three spinners if we want
 yaa phir ham dhammika prasad kii jagah kisi anya tej gendbaaj ko rakh sakate hai
 Or we can replace a spinner
 hamaare dimag main kuch sangyojan hai or shaam tak ham is par thos faisla kar lenge
 Sangakkara admitted that Muralitharan's lackluster performance in Ahmedabad was unnatural but denied that Sri Lanka had to pay too much reliance on the off-spinner
 unhone kaha 'jab aapaki team main duniya kaa sabase adhik wicket lene vaala gendbaaj ho to aap us par nirbhar rahete ho
 There are no two opinions in this
 murali ne sanath jayasoorya or chaminda vaas kii tarah varshon tak hamaare liye ahm bhoomika nibhaai he lekin hamaari team ke liye yah mahatvapurn he ki hamaare paas kai anya achche khilaadi bhi hai
 Sangakkara said, 'I don't think Murali was struggling in Ahmedabad
 vah hameshaa match vijeta rahegaa
 Cricket is the team game
 yadi ek khilaadi asafal rahata he to anya pradarshan karte hai
 We believe in all our players and believe they are very good
 ham aksar kaamchalau spinner ke taur par dilashaan kaa upyog karte hai
 Ultimately, it is the effort of the entire team
 ' motera ke sapaat wicket par 1598 ran bane tathaa harbhajan singh ne ise test cricket ke liye buree baat qaraar diya lekin sangakaara ise bada mudda nahin maanate
 He said, 'the wicket was very flat but we have to prepare ourselves to perform well on all types of pitches
 aapako koshish jari rakhni hogi
 Many times your effort is successful and not many times but if you keep trying then chances of getting something good increases
 ' green park kii pich ke bare main sangakaara ne kaha 'isamen adhik ghaas he lekin yah kaaphi shushk bhi he
 You can't say anything about it when you don't play

 uttar korea ke taanashaah marshall kim jong un kii sanak ke chalate duniyabar ne uske liye vyapaar ke raste band kar die hai
 Above all, UN sanctions have done the right thing
 ab alam ye he ki puraa uttar korea baari sankat main fansata dikh rahaa he
 There are reports that North Korea is now on the verge of ending fuel
 yahaan tak ki indhan kharidne ke liye uske paas paise bhi nahin hai
 Due to the catastrophe responsible for Kimkim Jong Un, his country is going to be in a very bad condition
 taanashaah kii manamaani nitiyon kii vajah se jo musiibat aane vaali he uskaa khamiyaaza bhugatne ke liye ab uttar korea ko taiyaar hona hoga
 No one else but the dictator Kim Jong-un will be responsible for the destruction
 kyonki apane mulk par ye tabaahi khud kim jong un laayaa he
 Oil famine! This catastrophe in North Korea is coming as a famine
 sanyukt raashtra or america pratibandhon kaa asar ab ye ho rahaa he ki desh main tel kaa baari akaal padane vaala he
 And if this happens, there will be bombs and missiles in this country but no oil
 tel ke khatm hone kaa matlab duniya jaanati he
 Neither will work in this country
 or na logon ke gharon main anaaj hoga
 That means starvation situations will occur
 zindagi tham jaaegi
 The chances of a civil war will prevail
 kim kaa khel khatmasidhe lafzon main kahen to uttar korea main padane vaala he ab tel kaa akaal
 Because North Korea now has oil to end
 magar sawaal ye he ki aakhir uttar korea main ye halaat bane kaise
 We will tell you how the end of the dictator's oil and ending of oil is clear
 kim kaa khel khatm
 The money looted on arms is a matter of concern that the North will suffer the consequences of the dictator's actions
 ab aap soch rahe honge ki kim jong un ne aakhir aisa kya kar diya he ki desh main tel main khatm hone kii naubat aa gai to suniye kim jong un ne wo kiya he jo kisi bhi desh kaa shaasha karne kii kalpana bhi nahin kar saktaa
 He looted his treasure on destructive weapons
 korea main mixilon ke test par arabon rupee kharch kar die gaye
 He lost immense wealth on the ski resort's ambitious project
 ab is phizulkharchi kaa sidhaa asar desh kii arthvyavastha par pad rahaa heetmi hathiyaaron main lagaaya tel kaa pasrub nateeja ye hua he ki kim jong un ke behisaab kharch ke chalate uttar korea kaa khajaana khaali ho gaya he
 Through the same treasury, he used to buy oil and fuel from other countries
 haalanki sanyukt raashtra or america kii paabandiyon ke tahat uttar korea ke tel aayaat par pehle hi badi baari roak lagi hui he
 But, now whatever hope was left, that too was sacrificed at the whim of Kim Jong Un to show himself the most powerful in the world
 kyonki kim jong un ne petroleum saamagree kii kharid ke liye bane fund kaa takreeban puraa istemaal apni vinaashkari mixilon or atomi hathiyaaron par kar daalaa he
 The biggest treasury, Khalisutra, claims that Kim Jong Un's father Kim Jong Il had set up a special fund for the purchase of petroleum fuel
 lekin kim ne iskaa beja istemaal apni mixilon kii dhar badhaane ke liye kar daalaa
 So the situation is becoming uncontrollable as Kim's biggest treasure has been emptied
 koyala niryaat se aadab aaiye aapako bataate hai ki uttar korea kaa taanashaah kim jong un hathiyaaron kii sanak ko puraa karne ke liye paisa laata kahaan se he
 North Korea receives a large amount of foreign exchange from coal exports
 vaise to sanyukt raashtra or america ne uttar korea ke koyala niryaat par agast 2017 se roak laga rakhi he
 Despite this, it is reported that with the help of Russia, it is doing coal business
 jaalsaji or drugs kaa kaarobaarauttar korea kii kamai kaa doosraa strot kathith rahasyamayi sanghathan offis number 39 he
 The organization is run by the North Korea Workers' Party and is said to have raised billions of dollars annually through illegal activities such as counterfeiting and the drug trade
 vahiin, videshon main based kareeb 1 lakh uttar korian naagarik har saal kariban 50 karod dollar swadesh bhejte hai
 And North Korea earns a modest amount from export business
 missile pareekshan par behisaab kharchajaahir he, uttar korea ke liye simit kamai main apni arthvyavastha ko chalaanaa aasaan nahin he
 That too when a freak ruler like Kim Jong Un
 jise atom bam or mixilon ke alaava kuch nazar hi naa aata ho
 The uncountable spending on the flood of missile tests under Kim Jong Un's regime broke the back of North Korea's economic situation
 kim ke shashan kaal main takreeban 20 bade missile test hue jin par behisaab paisa bahaya gaya
 Uncovered Russia, however, North Korea also has friends like China and Russia
 jin par chori chupe uttar korea ko tel supplai karne kaa aarope lagata rahata he
 However, China's piracy and satellite surveillance could not save China's theft
 aise main china ke liye bhi antarrashtriya paabandiyon ko nazarandaaj karke uttar korea ko tel dena mumkin nahin he
 And now in the pictures which have come out, his other friend ie Russia has also kept the pole open

 In the modern era, the first Pushpak aircraft or Kaahwahi ship flying is the story of 'hawaiian', but its flight is dependent on prayers and weak wings
 ayushmaan khurana (shibi) abhinit 'hawaijada' main teen sharton kaa khel hai
 The film's plot leads to an opinion that the film's writer and director Vibhu Puri is interested in Vedic knowledge
 'hawaijada' main shivkar baapuji talapade kii kahani ke jariye unhone vaidic gyaan ke mithkon ko sthapit karne kii koshish kii he
 However, those interested in Vedic knowledge will find this film important and they will defend it
 lekin maujuuda raajnneetik paridrishy main is film ko aalochana kii shakl main charchaa milani tay he, jaise grahamantri rajnath singh apane bayanon ko lekar charchaa main aa jate hai ki surya grahan kab lagegaa, ye mohalle ke pandit bataa denge
 The story of 'hawaiizada' is anonymous (sorry i didn't even know them before today) of scientist Shivkar Talpade, who flew the first airplane eight years before the Wright brothers? Although very little information is available in Shivkar Talpade's Ba Re, Ayushman Khuranane in the film has tried to do justice to the role of Shivkar
 puri film ayushmaan ke kandhe par tiki he
 However, Mithun Chakraborty, in the role of Sivakar's guru and Vedic scholar Shastri, has also put full emphasis
 film main utaar-chadhaav bahut hai, bevajaah gane or shibi kii prem kahani ne film ko khub hichkole khilaae hai
 So the spectator sitting on the chair also takes a lot of yawning
 yahi cheez film ko kamjor banaati he
 It would have been better for Vibhu Puri if only Shivkar had been focused on the story of Talpade taking flight, but the film has become very weak in showing Shibi's love story
 ayushmaan or mithun chakravartike screen par aane ke saath film main jaise hi jaan aati he, agle seen main film flats ho jaati he or darshak kaa man uchat jaataa he
 'bhanu on Yuga Sahastra Yojana
 
 Mithun Chakraborty has done a good job in the role of Vedic scholar Shastri, who sorted out the astronomical formulas with 'pallavi Sharda', though nothing has come in and she has remained merely a showpiece
 aisa nahin he ki 'hawaijada' main kuch bhi acha nahin he
 The film should be praised for its cinematography, visual depth, lighting and shades and it can be said that 'hawaiian' is also Savita Singh's film with Ayushman Khurana, who has done a great job
 film ke production dizinron kii bhi mehnat parde par najar aati he
 Had the editing of the film been tight, the film would have been more successful in keeping the audience engaged
 shivkar baapuji talapadeke bare main vibhu puri ne apni kahani likhane ke liye jo fact istemaal kiye hai, wo footnots kii tarah he
 In the film's storyline where the viewer expects depth and analysis, Vibhu Puri resorts to songs that make the film weak
 film kaa sangeet 'hawaijada'ke parde se utarate hi nepathy main chalaa jayega
 Because there is nothing in it that can leave its mark on the brain of the viewer
 apni kahani ke paksh main vibhu daleel dete hai ki teen saal pehle nasa ne paara se sanchalit vimaan banane kii baat kahi he
 Puri also tells the date of death of Shivkar Talpade's nephew (narayan Talpade)
 lekin public sphere main shivkar ke bare main utani jaankaree uplabdh nahin he
 Hence Vibhu Puri's side gets weakened
 haalanki 'hawaijada' vibhupuri kii pehali film he, lekin iske liye unhone jo vishay chunaa he
 He should be appreciated for that
 bollywood main vaidic gyaan or sutron par film banane kaa rivaaj naa ke baraabar rahaa he, lekin vibhu puri ne 'hawaijada' ke jariye isaki shuruyaat kar di he
 If Trigonometry is read in the language of sine and Cosine, then cutting two and a half hours of 'hawaiian' will not be difficult for you
 yah tasviir 14 disambar kii he jis din news channel eggzet pole aane kaa intazaar kar rahe the, pradhanmantri kaa road sho hua he or chunaav ayog ne rahul gandhi ko unke intervyuu ke liye notice bheja tha
 You can also decide by looking at these pictures that this picture of hoisting the religious flag on the roof of the entrance of Udaipur court in Rajasthan should have been the top priority of all those reports
 ek tarah se acha hua ki us din media ne is ghatana ko nazarandaaz kar diya, kya pataa isse maahaul karaab hi hota, magar kya is ghatana ko hameshaa ke liye nazarandaaz kiya ja saktaa he
 Shouldn't this incident be talked about so that the youth in this crowd who came right to the court with the help of some religious frenzy or justified anger, look at this picture again and consider what they do with a cold heart Were going hindu muslim ke dibet or baat baat par kanoon kii prakriya se baahar maamle ko nipataane kaa saahas samaaj ke liye ghaatak to he hi, kanoon vyavastha kii sansthaaon ke liye bhi badi chunauti ban saktaa he
 This picture of climbing the roof of the gate of the court of Udaipur, Rajasthan, blossoms with the dignity created by the Constitution
 jab aap supreme court ke gumbad par rashtriya dhvaj ko laharaate dekhte hai to shraddha umadti he ki yah sanstha raashtra dhvaj kii chaaya main sabake liye nyaay ke prati patibaddh he
 Will you be able to bear that someone hoists any flag other than the tricolor above the Supreme Court, will you be able to tolerate that a large number of people are going to shout slogans to influence the court proceedings
 ham insaaf ke darvaaze par jaakar ruuk jate hai, uski taraf nigaah kiye rahete hai ki faisla aayega or niyam kanoon or sabooton ke aadhaar par aayega
 During the last three years, there was so much debate about the tricolor
 uniwarsity main chaatro ne loktantric juluus nikaale to kaha gaya ki unamem rashtrawaad kii kami he, isliye vahaan 207 kii oonchai par tirangaa fahraaya jayega

 tab kii maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri smriti irani ke saath sabhi kendriya vishvavidhyalayon ke vaais chancelaron kii baithak hui
 It was decided that all the central universities would put up the national flag
 sabase pehle jeenyu main tirangaa lehregaa, jabaki vahaan pehle se hi tirangaa laharaata rahaa he
 It was published in the newspapers that this decision has been taken to instill a sense of unity and harmony among the students of higher education institutions and this move will send the message of a strong India
 is faisle ke sandarbh main rajasthan ke udaipur kii adaalat ke pravesh dwaar kii chat par bhagava dhvaj lahraane kii ghatana ko dekha janaa chahie
 Is there less of a sense of unity and harmony among these people, is there less of a sense of respect for the national flag, who climbed the roof and hoisted the flag of their organization
 14 disambar ke din yah noujvaan udaipur kii adaalat kii chat par bhagava dhvaj lekar chadh gaya
 a crowd of his supporters stood below
 dhvaj par jayshri ram or ram ji kii tasviir he
 This youngster has not been identified yet
 ye log kis sanghathan se jude hai, isaki bhi pahchaan nahin ho pai he
 Our colleague Sanjay Vyas says that most of the protesters were from outside the city
 14 disambar ko police or inke bich kai baar jhadap hui
 The number of times the police removed them, these people used to gather elsewhere
 shaam hote hote udaipur adaalat parisar ke baahar jamaa ho gaye or vahaan bhi maahaul ugr ho gaya
 Then some youngsters climbed onto the roof of the court complex and waved the saffron flag
 sochie, na sanghathan kaa pataa na pahchaan kaa pataa he or adaalat main itane log aa bhi jate hai or uski chat par dhwaja bhi laharaa dete hai
 Had the police not acted promptly on that day, the atmosphere could have worsened
 aapane kuch din pehle ek video dekha hoga, jisamen shambhulaal raigar bengal se aae mazdoor afaraazul kii hatya karata he or jala kar maar detaa he or phir video bhi banaata he
 Shambhulal was a resident of Rajsamand which is 70 km from Udaipur
 rajsamand main alag zila adaalat he
 Those who had gathered in Udaipur were demanding action against the members of the Muslim assembly
 muslim sabha kaa koi video viral hua tha, jisamen aapattijanak naare lagaae ja rahe the
 Police arrested 10 people in connection with the viral video, four are still in jail and six have been given bail
 police ko inase bhi sakhti se pesh aana chahie or poocha janaa chahie ki aise naaron ko lagaakar wo kiskaa bhala kar rahe hai
 Are they deliberately setting fire to a counter-attack
 afrajul kii hatya hui he, sharmnaak he, mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne bhi kaha he ki ghatana sharmnaak he or police ne giraftaar main deree nahin kii he, lekin majamaa lagaakar aise naare lagane kii himmat kahaan se ai
 Police should also keep a constant watch on such people
 sawaal he ki agar hindu sanghathan kii maang sahi bhi thi to bhi kya yah sahi tha ki ve pradarshan karte hue adaalat tak aate or chat par chadhakar bhagava dhvaj laharaa dete
 Had no respect for the Constitution left in the minds of these youths
 ganimat he ki pradarshnakariyon ne us jagah ko nahin chhedaa jahaan vaaki tirangaa laharaa rahaa hota he
 Even today, the tricolor is still safe in the court premises of Udaipur
 rajasthan ke grahamantri gulabchand kataaria ji bhi udaipur se hi aate hai
 Should the government not take special caution about this incident? agar isi tarah bheed apni takat dharmik pahchaan se hasil karti rahi to halaat kya ho sakate hai
 Can we say with the claim that such an event is final
 kya ham kabhi soch sakate the ki aisi tasviir dekhne ko milegi, adaalat kaa parisar hoga, baahar bheed hogi or chat par koi bhagava liye khadaa hoga
 Police had detained 200 people that day in connection with the Udaipur incident
 kai aise bhi the jo apane adalati kaam se vahaan gaye the
 All were later released on bail
 tirangaa kii ek galat tasviir dikh jaati he to twitor jagat sakriy ho jaataa he
 Storms arise in TV channels
 media or samaaj ke liye udaipur kii ghatana ko bhula dena kya itnaa sahaj ho saktaa he
 Should not citizens of any political identity equipped with constitutional obligations become cautious from this picture
 ham udaipur police ke aiji kaa bayaan dikhaanaa chaahate hai jo unhone ghatana ke din media se baat karte hue kaha tha
 The condition is that some people on the tweet also started criticizing Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje as to why they allowed the protesters to act
 aise tarkon ko bhi jagah mil rahi he or aae din log aisi ghatnaon se sahaj hote ja rahe hai
 Many people also condemned the incident
 is ghatana ko bhavukta yaa aakrosh se mat dekhiye, thande dimag se dekhie or sochie ki kahin hamane samvaad ke saare maukey kho to nahin diye hai
 Can anyone get angry about religious reasons to such an extent that they get closer to the court building
 hamaare sahyogi munne bharti ne prashanth bhushan se baat kii, vahi aise maamalon main sabase pehle bolne kaa jokhim bhi uthaate hai
 Many times there is a conflict between Hindus and Muslims
 aisi sthiti kaa laabh uthaakar bheed kaa nirmaan karnaa chahie, use haank kar court kii taraf le janaa chahie, kya karnaa chahie tha, is par aap hi vichaar karen
 How is any such crowd that is not afraid of court and law changing our society
 samvidhanik sansthaaon ke prati hamaare nazariye ko kaise badalati he sabko samajhnaa chahie
 i was in Goa on Saturday
 vahaan ek diwaar par ek poster dekha
 This poster is of Hindu Jan Jagriti Samiti
 is poster main raashtra dhvaj ke sammaan kii baaten likhi hai
 It has been said that do not use plastic flag, do not make the shape of the national flag on the face and body
 kahin par raashtra dhvaj padaa mili to use sammaan ke saath shaskeey karyaalay main jamaa kiijie, lekin udaipur ke ye noujvaan kisi agyaat hindu sanghathan ke naam par jamaa hokar adaalat parisar tak aa gaye or chat par ram pataakaa laharaa diya
 Would it be an honor for the national flag to do so for the Hindu Jagran Samiti? The view of two types of Hindu organizations before us, you decide
 hamaare sahyogi susheel kumaar mahapatra ne ritred justise sodhi se baatcheet kii
 He said that the judiciary cannot run like this
 hamaare sahyogi himanshu shekhar mishra ne rajyasabha sadsy or vakil keties tulsi se bhi baat kii
 We also called the Advocate General of Rajasthan but did not talk
 ummid he desh ke kanoon mantri yaa supreme court ke chif justise is ghatana kaa sangyaan lenge
 What kind of sounds are coming
 madhyapradesh ke guna se bijepi ke vidhayak panna laal shakya bhaashan de rahe hai ki viraat kohli or anoushka sharma ne desh ke baahar jaakar kyon shaadi kii
 The MLA is saying that Ram is married in this country, Krishna is married, Yudhishthira is married, you are also married, but both of them married abroad
 paisa yahaan se kamaaya or rupaya le gaya videsh main
 After all, where is this thinking coming from? baat baat main dharm kaa virdohi qaraar diya janaa, baat baat main desh kaa virdohi karaara diya janaa
 The poster of Prime Minister Modi was visible on the platform from which MLA was giving speech
 ek or tasviir ai in dinon
 The comments shanivaar ko jodhpur jail se adaalat main peshi ke liye aae asaram baapu ke paanv ek purv mukhya nyaayadhish esen bhargav ne jaakar chhu liya
 Normally, the police prevent a prisoner from getting close, but Justice Bhargava touched his feet
 kya hoicourt ke ek purv mukhya nyaayadhish ko aisa karnaa chahie tha, kya nyaay ke prati logon main acha sandesh jayega
 Justice Bhargava has also been the Governor of Sikkim
 kya hamane galat ko galat kehane kaa saahas kho diya he yaa ab bahut se log aisi ghatnaon se sahamat hone lage hai, jisamen media bhi shaamil he
 One view may be that these young people should be treated harshly, it should be, but my point of view is different
 muslim sabha or udaipur kii adaalat ke pravesh dwaar par bhagava fahraane vaale sabhi naujavaanon se kisi ko baat karnaa chahie
 Are they upset about not getting a job, how do they get so angry about religion, farmers commit suicide, why don't they get angry about their compassion or system
 hamen inase aankh milakar baat to kerani hogi, poochna to hoga ki jaanboojh kar ye apni zindagi or dusron kii zindagi daanv par kyon laga rahe hai, kya kisi bade sanghathan ne inase kuch vaada kiya he, koi inhen bachaa lene kaa bharosa de rahaa he, kya baat he
 You will know only by talking
 kya is ghatana par baat nahin honi chahie taaki is bheed main shaamil noujvaan jo kisi dharmik unmaad yaa jaays gusse ke sahare hi sahi, adaalat kii taraf daude chale aae the, is tasviir ko phir se dekhen or thande man se vichaar karen ki ve kya karne ja rahe the
 The courage to settle the matter outside the process of law on the debates and talk of Hindu Muslim is not only fatal for the society, but can also pose a big challenge for the institutions of law and order
 rajasthan ke udaipur kii adaalat ke get kii chat par chadhakar bhagava dhvaj lahraane kii yah tasviir samvidhan kii banaai tamaam maryaada se khilwaad karti he
 When you see the national flag waving at the dome of the Supreme Court, there is awe that this institution is committed to justice for all in the shadow of the national flag
 kya aap yah sahan kar sakenge ki koi supreme court ke upar tirange ke alaava koi or dhvaj fahraa de, kya aap yah bhi bardaasht kar sakenge ki adaalat kii kaarywahi ko prabhavit karne ke liye baahar badi sankhya main log narebaazi karne ja rahe ho
 We stop at the door of justice, keep an eye on him that the decision will come and the rule will be based on the law and the evidence
 pichley teen saal ke dauraan tirange ke lekar kitni bahes hui
 When the students took out a democratic procession in the university, it was said that they lack nationalism, so the tricolor will be hoisted at the height of 207 there
 19 farvari 2016 ke akhabaaron or website check kiijie
 Vice Chancellors of all central universities met with then HRD Minister Smriti Irani
 isamen faisla hua ki sabhi kendriya vishvavidhyalay rashtriya dhvaj lagaayenge
 First the tricolor will be hoisted in JNU, while there is already tricolor
 akhabaaron main chapa tha ki ucch shiksha sansthaanon ke chaatro main ekta or sauhaard kii bhaavana paidaa karne ke liye yah faisla liya gaya he or is kadam se majboot bharat kaa sandesh jayega
 In the context of this decision, the incident of waving saffron flag on the roof of the entrance of Udaipur court in Rajasthan should be seen
 kya in logon main ekta or sauhaard kii bhaavana kam he, kya rashtriya dhvaj ke prati sammaan kii bhaavana kam he jo apane sanghathan kaa dhvaj lekar chat par chadh gaye or fahraa aae
 On 14 December, this young man climbed to the roof of Udaipur court carrying the saffron flag
 neeche uske samarthakon kii bheed khadi thi
 The flag has a picture of Jayashree Ram and Ram Ji
 abhi tak is noujvaan kii pahchaan nahin ho pai he
 Which organization are these people associated with, it has also not been identified
 hamaare sahyogi sanjay vyas kaa kahana he ki zyaadaatar pradarshnkaree shahar se baahar ke the
 On December 14, there were several clashes between the police and them
 police jitani baar inhen hataati, ye log duusari jagah jamaa ho jate the
 By evening, Udaipur had gathered outside the court premises and the atmosphere there became fierce
 tabhi kuch noujvaan adaalat parisar kii chat par chadh gaye or bhagava dhvaj laharaa diya
 Think, neither the address of the organization nor the address of identity and so many people come to the court and hoist the flag on its roof
 police ne usadin tatparta se karrwai na kii hoti to maahaul or karaab ho saktaa tha
 You must have seen a video a few days ago, in which Shambhulal Rager murders and burns Afrazul, a laborer from Bengal and then also makes the video
 shambhulaal rajsamand kaa rahane vaala tha jo udaipur se 70 kimi he
 Rajsamand has a separate district court
 udaipur main jo log jamaa hue the wo muslim sabha ke sadasyon ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang kar rahe the
 Offensive slogans were being raised in which a video of the Muslim gathering went viral
 police ne viral hue video ke maamle main 10 logon ko giraftaar kiya tha, chaar abhi jail main he or chah kii zamaanat ho gai he
 The police should also treat them strictly and should be asked who they are doing well by raising such slogans
 kya wo kisi javaabi bheed ke liye jaanboojh kar aag laga rahe hai
 Afrajul has been murdered, shameful, Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has also said that the incident is shameful and the police have not delayed the arrest, but where did the courage to raise such slogans by raising a magma
 aise logon par bhi police ko lagaataar nazar rakhni chahie
 The question is that even if the demand of the Hindu organization was true, was it right that they would come to the court in protest and climb the roof and wave the saffron flag
 kya in yuvaaon ke man main samvidhan ke prati koi sammaan nahin bachaa tha
 It is a matter of honor that the protesters did not touch the place where the tricolor is actually flying
 aaj bhi udaipur kii adaalat parisar main aaj bhi tirangaa mahfuz he
 Home Minister of Rajasthan Gulabchand Kataria also comes from Udaipur
 kya sarkaar ko is ghatana ko lekar vishesh satarkta nahin baratani chahie
 If the crowd continues to gain its strength through religious identity, what can be the situation? kya ham daawey ke saath kah sakate hai ki is tarah kii ghatana antim he
 Could we ever imagine that such a picture would be seen, there would be a court complex, there would be a crowd outside and someone would stand with a saffron on the roof
 police ne udaipur kii ghatana ke maamle main us din 200 logon ko hiraasat main liya tha
 There were many who went there for their court work
 baad main sabhi ko zamaanat par chhod diya gaya
 If a wrong picture of the tricolor is seen, then the Twitter world becomes active
 tivi channelon main tufaan khadaa ho jaataa he
 Can it be so easy for the media and society to forget the Udaipur incident
 sanvaidhanik daayityon se las kisi bhi raajnneetik pahchaan ke nagarikon ko kya is tasviir se satark nahin ho janaa chahie
 We want to show the statement of the IG of Udaipur police which he said while talking to the media on the day of the incident
 haalat yah he ki twit par kuch log mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje kii bhi aalochana karne lage ki unhone pradarshnakariyon par karrwai kyon hone di
 Such arguments are also getting place and people are getting comfortable with such incidents
 kai logon ne is ghatana kii ninda bhi kii
 Do not look at this incident with sentiment or anger, look at it with a cool head and think if we have lost all the opportunities for dialogue
 kya dharmik vajahon ko lekar koi is had tak ugr ho saktaa he ki adaalat kii imaarat ke kareeb pahunch jaae
 Our colleague Munne Bharti spoke to Prashant Bhushan, he also risks speaking first in such cases
 hindu or musalmaan ke bich kai baar takaraav kii naubat aati he
 Taking advantage of such a situation, the crowd should be built, it should be taken to the court, what should have been done, you should consider it
 aisi kisi bhi bheed jise adaalat or kanoon kaa khoff na ho, hamaare samaaj ko kaise badal rahi he
 Everyone should understand how our attitude towards constitutional institutions changes
 main shanivaar ko goa main tha
 Saw a poster on a wall there
 yah poster hindu jan jagriti samiti kaa he
 This poster has written about the honor of the national flag
 kaha gaya he ki plastic ke dhvaj kaa istamaal na karen, chehre or sharir par raashtra dhvaj kii akruti na banaaen
 If found the national flag somewhere, submit it with respect to the government office, but these young men of Udaipur gathered in the name of some unknown Hindu organization and came to the court premises and waved Ram flag on the roof
 kya hindu jaagran samiti ke lihaaz se aisa karnaa raashtra dhvaj kaa sammaan hoga? hamaare saamne do tarah ke hindu sanghathanon kaa nazariyaa, faisla aap kiijie
 Our colleague Sushil Kumar Mohapatra spoke to retired Justice Sodhi
 unhone kaha ki nyaaypalika is tarah se nahin chal sakati he
 Our colleague Himanshu Shekhar Mishra also spoke to Rajya Sabha member and lawyer KTS Tulsi
 hamane rajasthan ke mahadhivaktaa ko bhi phone kiya magar baat nahin hui
 It is expected that the Law Minister of the country or the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court will take cognizance of this incident
 kisi kisi awaazen aa rahi hai
 BJP MLA from Madhya Pradesh's Guna Panna Lal Shakya is giving a speech on why Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma got married outside the country
 vidhayak ji kah rahe hai ki is desh main ram kaa vivaah hua he, krishna kaa hua he, yudhisthir kaa hua he, aap logon kaa bhi hua he, magar donon ne videsh main shaadi kii
 Earned money from here and took money abroad
 aakhir ye soch kahaan se aa rahi he
 Talking about being said to be anti-religion, in talking vidhayak ji jis manch se bhaashan de rahe the, us par pradhanmantri modi kaa hi poster nazar aa rahaa tha
 Another picture came these days
 tippaniyan On Saturday, a former Chief Justice SN Bhargava touched the feet of Asaram Bapu, who appeared in court from Jodhpur jail
 aam taur par police kisi kaidi ke kareeb jane se rokatii he magar justise bhargav ne unke paanv chhu liye
 Should a former Chief Justice of the High Court have done this, will a good message go to the people towards justice
 justise bhargav sikkim ke rajyapal bhi rah chuke hai
 Have we lost the courage to call the wrong wrong or now many people have started agreeing to such incidents, including the media
 ek nazariyaa yah ho saktaa he ki in naujavaanon se sakhti se pesh aayaa jaae, yah hona chahie magar meraa nazariyaa kuch or bhi he
 Someone should talk to all the youth who hoist saffron at the entrance of Muslim Sabha and Udaipur court
 kya ve naukari na milane se pareshaan hai, unke bheetar dharm ko lekar itnaa gussa kaise aa jaataa he, kisaan aatmahatya karte hai, use lekar unke bheetar karuna yaa system ke prati gussa kyon nahin aata he
 We have to talk to them with an eye, and ask why they are deliberately putting their lives and the lives of others at stake, has any big organization promised them something, someone is promising to save them, What is the matter
 baat karne se hi pataa chalegaa
 This picture of climbing the roof of the gate of the court of Udaipur, Rajasthan, blossoms with the dignity created by the Constitution
 jab aap supreme court ke gumbad par rashtriya dhvaj ko laharaate dekhte hai to shraddha umadti he ki yah sanstha raashtra dhvaj kii chaaya main sabake liye nyaay ke prati patibaddh he
 Will you be able to bear that someone hoists any flag other than the tricolor above the Supreme Court, will you be able to tolerate that a large number of people are going to shout slogans to influence the court proceedings
 ham insaaf ke darvaaze par jaakar ruuk jate hai, uski taraf nigaah kiye rahete hai ki faisla aayega or niyam kanoon or sabooton ke aadhaar par aayega

 Storms arise in TV channels
 media or samaaj ke liye udaipur kii ghatana ko bhula dena kya itnaa sahaj ho saktaa he
 Should not citizens of any political identity equipped with constitutional obligations become cautious from this picture
 ham udaipur police ke aiji kaa bayaan dikhaanaa chaahate hai jo unhone ghatana ke din media se baat karte hue kaha tha
 The condition is that some people on the tweet also started criticizing Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje as to why they allowed the protesters to act
 aise tarkon ko bhi jagah mil rahi he or aae din log aisi ghatnaon se sahaj hote ja rahe hai
 Many people also condemned the incident
 is ghatana ko bhavukta yaa aakrosh se mat dekhiye, thande dimag se dekhie or sochie ki kahin hamane samvaad ke saare maukey kho to nahin diye hai
 Can anyone get angry about religious reasons to such an extent that they get closer to the court building
 hamaare sahyogi munne bharti ne prashanth bhushan se baat kii, vahi aise maamalon main sabase pehle bolne kaa jokhim bhi uthaate hai
 Many times there is a conflict between Hindus and Muslims
 aisi sthiti kaa laabh uthaakar bheed kaa nirmaan karnaa chahie, use haank kar court kii taraf le janaa chahie, kya karnaa chahie tha, is par aap hi vichaar karen
 How is any such crowd that is not afraid of court and law changing our society
 samvidhanik sansthaaon ke prati hamaare nazariye ko kaise badalati he sabko samajhnaa chahie
 i was in Goa on Saturday
 vahaan ek diwaar par ek poster dekha
 This poster is of Hindu Jan Jagriti Samiti
 is poster main raashtra dhvaj ke sammaan kii baaten likhi hai
 It has been said that do not use plastic flag, do not make the shape of the national flag on the face and body
 kahin par raashtra dhvaj padaa mili to use sammaan ke saath shaskeey karyaalay main jamaa kiijie, lekin udaipur ke ye noujvaan kisi agyaat hindu sanghathan ke naam par jamaa hokar adaalat parisar tak aa gaye or chat par ram pataakaa laharaa diya
 Would it be an honor for the national flag to do so for the Hindu Jagran Samiti? The view of two types of Hindu organizations before us, you decide
 hamaare sahyogi susheel kumaar mahapatra ne ritred justise sodhi se baatcheet kii
 He said that the judiciary cannot run like this
 hamaare sahyogi himanshu shekhar mishra ne rajyasabha sadsy or vakil keties tulsi se bhi baat kii
 We also called the Advocate General of Rajasthan but did not talk
 ummid he desh ke kanoon mantri yaa supreme court ke chif justise is ghatana kaa sangyaan lenge
 What kind of sounds are coming
 madhyapradesh ke guna se bijepi ke vidhayak panna laal shakya bhaashan de rahe hai ki viraat kohli or anoushka sharma ne desh ke baahar jaakar kyon shaadi kii
 The MLA is saying that Ram is married in this country, Krishna is married, Yudhishthira is married, you are also married, but both of them married abroad
 paisa yahaan se kamaaya or rupaya le gaya videsh main
 After all, where is this thinking coming from? baat baat main dharm kaa virdohi qaraar diya janaa, baat baat main desh kaa virdohi karaara diya janaa
 The poster of Prime Minister Modi was visible on the platform from which MLA was giving speech
 ek or tasviir ai in dinon
 The comments shanivaar ko jodhpur jail se adaalat main peshi ke liye aae asaram baapu ke paanv ek purv mukhya nyaayadhish esen bhargav ne jaakar chhu liya
 Normally, the police prevent a prisoner from getting close, but Justice Bhargava touched his feet
 kya hoicourt ke ek purv mukhya nyaayadhish ko aisa karnaa chahie tha, kya nyaay ke prati logon main acha sandesh jayega
 Justice Bhargava has also been the Governor of Sikkim
 kya hamane galat ko galat kehane kaa saahas kho diya he yaa ab bahut se log aisi ghatnaon se sahamat hone lage hai, jisamen media bhi shaamil he
 One view may be that these young people should be treated harshly, it should be, but my point of view is different
 muslim sabha or udaipur kii adaalat ke pravesh dwaar par bhagava fahraane vaale sabhi naujavaanon se kisi ko baat karnaa chahie
 Are they upset about not getting a job, how do they get so angry about religion, farmers commit suicide, why don't they get angry about their compassion or system
 hamen inase aankh milakar baat to kerani hogi, poochna to hoga ki jaanboojh kar ye apni zindagi or dusron kii zindagi daanv par kyon laga rahe hai, kya kisi bade sanghathan ne inase kuch vaada kiya he, koi inhen bachaa lene kaa bharosa de rahaa he, kya baat he
 You will know only by talking
 pichley teen saal ke dauraan tirange ke lekar kitni bahes hui
 When the students took out a democratic procession in the university, it was said that they lack nationalism, so the tricolor will be hoisted at the height of 207 there
 19 farvari 2016 ke akhabaaron or website check kiijie
 Vice Chancellors of all central universities met with then HRD Minister Smriti Irani
 isamen faisla hua ki sabhi kendriya vishvavidhyalay rashtriya dhvaj lagaayenge
 First the tricolor will be hoisted in JNU, while there is already tricolor
 akhabaaron main chapa tha ki ucch shiksha sansthaanon ke chaatro main ekta or sauhaard kii bhaavana paidaa karne ke liye yah faisla liya gaya he or is kadam se majboot bharat kaa sandesh jayega
 In the context of this decision, the incident of waving saffron flag on the roof of the entrance of Udaipur court in Rajasthan should be seen
 kya in logon main ekta or sauhaard kii bhaavana kam he, kya rashtriya dhvaj ke prati sammaan kii bhaavana kam he jo apane sanghathan kaa dhvaj lekar chat par chadh gaye or fahraa aae
 On 14 December, this young man climbed to the roof of Udaipur court carrying the saffron flag
 neeche uske samarthakon kii bheed khadi thi
 The flag has a picture of Jayashree Ram and Ram Ji
 abhi tak is noujvaan kii pahchaan nahin ho pai he
 Which organization are these people associated with, it has also not been identified
 hamaare sahyogi sanjay vyas kaa kahana he ki zyaadaatar pradarshnkaree shahar se baahar ke the
 On December 14, there were several clashes between the police and them
 police jitani baar inhen hataati, ye log duusari jagah jamaa ho jate the
 By evening, Udaipur had gathered outside the court premises and the atmosphere there became fierce
 tabhi kuch noujvaan adaalat parisar kii chat par chadh gaye or bhagava dhvaj laharaa diya
 Think, neither the address of the organization nor the address of identity and so many people come to the court and hoist the flag on its roof
 police ne usadin tatparta se karrwai na kii hoti to maahaul or karaab ho saktaa tha
 You must have seen a video a few days ago, in which Shambhulal Rager murders and burns Afrazul, a laborer from Bengal and then also makes the video
 shambhulaal rajsamand kaa rahane vaala tha jo udaipur se 70 kimi he
 Rajsamand has a separate district court
 udaipur main jo log jamaa hue the wo muslim sabha ke sadasyon ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang kar rahe the
 Offensive slogans were being raised in which a video of the Muslim gathering went viral
 police ne viral hue video ke maamle main 10 logon ko giraftaar kiya tha, chaar abhi jail main he or chah kii zamaanat ho gai he
 The police should also treat them strictly and should be asked who they are doing well by raising such slogans
 kya wo kisi javaabi bheed ke liye jaanboojh kar aag laga rahe hai
 Afrajul has been murdered, shameful, Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has also said that the incident is shameful and the police have not delayed the arrest, but where did the courage to raise such slogans by raising a magma
 aise logon par bhi police ko lagaataar nazar rakhni chahie
 The question is that even if the demand of the Hindu organization was true, was it right that they would come to the court in protest and climb the roof and wave the saffron flag
 kya in yuvaaon ke man main samvidhan ke prati koi sammaan nahin bachaa tha
 It is a matter of honor that the protesters did not touch the place where the tricolor is actually flying
 aaj bhi udaipur kii adaalat parisar main aaj bhi tirangaa mahfuz he
 Home Minister of Rajasthan Gulabchand Kataria also comes from Udaipur
 kya sarkaar ko is ghatana ko lekar vishesh satarkta nahin baratani chahie
 If the crowd continues to gain its strength through religious identity, what can be the situation? kya ham daawey ke saath kah sakate hai ki is tarah kii ghatana antim he
 Could we ever imagine that such a picture would be seen, there would be a court complex, there would be a crowd outside and someone would stand with a saffron on the roof
 police ne udaipur kii ghatana ke maamle main us din 200 logon ko hiraasat main liya tha
 There were many who went there for their court work
 baad main sabhi ko zamaanat par chhod diya gaya
 If a wrong picture of the tricolor is seen, then the Twitter world becomes active
 tivi channelon main tufaan khadaa ho jaataa he
 Can it be so easy for the media and society to forget the Udaipur incident
 sanvaidhanik daayityon se las kisi bhi raajnneetik pahchaan ke nagarikon ko kya is tasviir se satark nahin ho janaa chahie
 We want to show the statement of the IG of Udaipur police which he said while talking to the media on the day of the incident
 haalat yah he ki twit par kuch log mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje kii bhi aalochana karne lage ki unhone pradarshnakariyon par karrwai kyon hone di
 Such arguments are also getting place and people are getting comfortable with such incidents
 kai logon ne is ghatana kii ninda bhi kii
 Do not look at this incident with sentiment or anger, look at it with a cool head and think if we have lost all the opportunities for dialogue
 kya dharmik vajahon ko lekar koi is had tak ugr ho saktaa he ki adaalat kii imaarat ke kareeb pahunch jaae
 Our colleague Munne Bharti spoke to Prashant Bhushan, he also risks speaking first in such cases
 hindu or musalmaan ke bich kai baar takaraav kii naubat aati he
 Taking advantage of such a situation, the crowd should be built, it should be taken to the court, what should have been done, you should consider it
 aisi kisi bhi bheed jise adaalat or kanoon kaa khoff na ho, hamaare samaaj ko kaise badal rahi he
 Everyone should understand how our attitude towards constitutional institutions changes
 main shanivaar ko goa main tha
 Saw a poster on a wall there
 yah poster hindu jan jagriti samiti kaa he
 This poster has written about the honor of the national flag
 kaha gaya he ki plastic ke dhvaj kaa istamaal na karen, chehre or sharir par raashtra dhvaj kii akruti na banaaen
 If found the national flag somewhere, submit it with respect to the government office, but these young men of Udaipur gathered in the name of some unknown Hindu organization and came to the court premises and waved Ram flag on the roof
 kya hindu jaagran samiti ke lihaaz se aisa karnaa raashtra dhvaj kaa sammaan hoga? hamaare saamne do tarah ke hindu sanghathanon kaa nazariyaa, faisla aap kiijie
 Our colleague Sushil Kumar Mohapatra spoke to retired Justice Sodhi
 unhone kaha ki nyaaypalika is tarah se nahin chal sakati he
 Our colleague Himanshu Shekhar Mishra also spoke to Rajya Sabha member and lawyer KTS Tulsi
 hamane rajasthan ke mahadhivaktaa ko bhi phone kiya magar baat nahin hui
 It is expected that the Law Minister of the country or the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court will take cognizance of this incident
 kisi kisi awaazen aa rahi hai
 BJP MLA from Madhya Pradesh's Guna Panna Lal Shakya is giving a speech on why Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma got married outside the country
 vidhayak ji kah rahe hai ki is desh main ram kaa vivaah hua he, krishna kaa hua he, yudhisthir kaa hua he, aap logon kaa bhi hua he, magar donon ne videsh main shaadi kii
 Earned money from here and took money abroad
 aakhir ye soch kahaan se aa rahi he
 Talking about being said to be anti-religion, in talking vidhayak ji jis manch se bhaashan de rahe the, us par pradhanmantri modi kaa hi poster nazar aa rahaa tha
 Another picture came these days
 tippaniyan On Saturday, a former Chief Justice SN Bhargava touched the feet of Asaram Bapu, who appeared in court from Jodhpur jail
 aam taur par police kisi kaidi ke kareeb jane se rokatii he magar justise bhargav ne unke paanv chhu liye
 Should a former Chief Justice of the High Court have done this, will a good message go to the people towards justice
 justise bhargav sikkim ke rajyapal bhi rah chuke hai
 Have we lost the courage to call the wrong wrong or now many people have started agreeing to such incidents, including the media
 ek nazariyaa yah ho saktaa he ki in naujavaanon se sakhti se pesh aayaa jaae, yah hona chahie magar meraa nazariyaa kuch or bhi he
 Someone should talk to all the youth who hoist saffron at the entrance of Muslim Sabha and Udaipur court
 kya ve naukari na milane se pareshaan hai, unke bheetar dharm ko lekar itnaa gussa kaise aa jaataa he, kisaan aatmahatya karte hai, use lekar unke bheetar karuna yaa system ke prati gussa kyon nahin aata he
 We have to talk to them with an eye, and ask why they are deliberately putting their lives and the lives of others at stake, has any big organization promised them something, someone is promising to save them, What is the matter
 baat karne se hi pataa chalegaa

 14 disambar ko police or inke bich kai baar jhadap hui
 The number of times the police removed them, these people used to gather elsewhere
 shaam hote hote udaipur adaalat parisar ke baahar jamaa ho gaye or vahaan bhi maahaul ugr ho gaya
 Then some youngsters climbed onto the roof of the court complex and waved the saffron flag
 sochie, na sanghathan kaa pataa na pahchaan kaa pataa he or adaalat main itane log aa bhi jate hai or uski chat par dhwaja bhi laharaa dete hai
 Had the police not acted promptly on that day, the atmosphere could have worsened

 Shambhulal was a resident of Rajsamand which is 70 km from Udaipur

 Those who had gathered in Udaipur were demanding action against the members of the Muslim assembly
 muslim sabha kaa koi video viral hua tha, jisamen aapattijanak naare lagaae ja rahe the
 Police arrested 10 people in connection with the viral video, four are still in jail and six have been given bail

 Are they deliberately setting fire to a counter-attack
 afrajul kii hatya hui he, sharmnaak he, mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne bhi kaha he ki ghatana sharmnaak he or police ne giraftaar main deree nahin kii he, lekin majamaa lagaakar aise naare lagane kii himmat kahaan se ai
 Police should also keep a constant watch on such people
 sawaal he ki agar hindu sanghathan kii maang sahi bhi thi to bhi kya yah sahi tha ki ve pradarshan karte hue adaalat tak aate or chat par chadhakar bhagava dhvaj laharaa dete
 Had no respect for the Constitution left in the minds of these youths
 ganimat he ki pradarshnakariyon ne us jagah ko nahin chhedaa jahaan vaaki tirangaa laharaa rahaa hota he
 Even today, the tricolor is still safe in the court premises of Udaipur
 rajasthan ke grahamantri gulabchand kataaria ji bhi udaipur se hi aate hai
 Should the government not take special caution about this incident? agar isi tarah bheed apni takat dharmik pahchaan se hasil karti rahi to halaat kya ho sakate hai
 Can we say with the claim that such an event is final
 kya ham kabhi soch sakate the ki aisi tasviir dekhne ko milegi, adaalat kaa parisar hoga, baahar bheed hogi or chat par koi bhagava liye khadaa hoga
 Police had detained 200 people that day in connection with the Udaipur incident
 kai aise bhi the jo apane adalati kaam se vahaan gaye the
 All were later released on bail

 The condition is that some people on the tweet also started criticizing Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje as to why they allowed the protesters to act

 sawaal he ki agar hindu sanghathan kii maang sahi bhi thi to bhi kya yah sahi tha ki ve pradarshan karte hue adaalat tak aate or chat par chadhakar bhagava dhvaj laharaa dete
 Had no respect for the Constitution left in the minds of these youths
 ganimat he ki pradarshnakariyon ne us jagah ko nahin chhedaa jahaan vaaki tirangaa laharaa rahaa hota he
 Even today, the tricolor is still safe in the court premises of Udaipur
 rajasthan ke grahamantri gulabchand kataaria ji bhi udaipur se hi aate hai
 Should the government not take special caution about this incident? agar isi tarah bheed apni takat dharmik pahchaan se hasil karti rahi to halaat kya ho sakate hai
 Can we say with the claim that such an event is final
 kya ham kabhi soch sakate the ki aisi tasviir dekhne ko milegi, adaalat kaa parisar hoga, baahar bheed hogi or chat par koi bhagava liye khadaa hoga
 Police had detained 200 people that day in connection with the Udaipur incident
 kai aise bhi the jo apane adalati kaam se vahaan gaye the
 All were later released on bail
 tirangaa kii ek galat tasviir dikh jaati he to twitor jagat sakriy ho jaataa he
 Storms arise in TV channels
 media or samaaj ke liye udaipur kii ghatana ko bhula dena kya itnaa sahaj ho saktaa he
 Should not citizens of any political identity equipped with constitutional obligations become cautious from this picture
 ham udaipur police ke aiji kaa bayaan dikhaanaa chaahate hai jo unhone ghatana ke din media se baat karte hue kaha tha
 The condition is that some people on the tweet also started criticizing Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje as to why they allowed the protesters to act
 aise tarkon ko bhi jagah mil rahi he or aae din log aisi ghatnaon se sahaj hote ja rahe hai
 Many people also condemned the incident
 is ghatana ko bhavukta yaa aakrosh se mat dekhiye, thande dimag se dekhie or sochie ki kahin hamane samvaad ke saare maukey kho to nahin diye hai
 Can anyone get angry about religious reasons to such an extent that they get closer to the court building
 hamaare sahyogi munne bharti ne prashanth bhushan se baat kii, vahi aise maamalon main sabase pehle bolne kaa jokhim bhi uthaate hai
 Many times there is a conflict between Hindus and Muslims
 aisi sthiti kaa laabh uthaakar bheed kaa nirmaan karnaa chahie, use haank kar court kii taraf le janaa chahie, kya karnaa chahie tha, is par aap hi vichaar karen
 How is any such crowd that is not afraid of court and law changing our society
 samvidhanik sansthaaon ke prati hamaare nazariye ko kaise badalati he sabko samajhnaa chahie
 i was in Goa on Saturday
 vahaan ek diwaar par ek poster dekha
 This poster is of Hindu Jan Jagriti Samiti
 is poster main raashtra dhvaj ke sammaan kii baaten likhi hai
 It has been said that do not use plastic flag, do not make the shape of the national flag on the face and body
 kahin par raashtra dhvaj padaa mili to use sammaan ke saath shaskeey karyaalay main jamaa kiijie, lekin udaipur ke ye noujvaan kisi agyaat hindu sanghathan ke naam par jamaa hokar adaalat parisar tak aa gaye or chat par ram pataakaa laharaa diya
 Would it be an honor for the national flag to do so for the Hindu Jagran Samiti? The view of two types of Hindu organizations before us, you decide

 He said that the judiciary cannot run like this
 hamaare sahyogi himanshu shekhar mishra ne rajyasabha sadsy or vakil keties tulsi se bhi baat kii
 We also called the Advocate General of Rajasthan but did not talk
 ummid he desh ke kanoon mantri yaa supreme court ke chif justise is ghatana kaa sangyaan lenge
 What kind of sounds are coming
 madhyapradesh ke guna se bijepi ke vidhayak panna laal shakya bhaashan de rahe hai ki viraat kohli or anoushka sharma ne desh ke baahar jaakar kyon shaadi kii
 The MLA is saying that Ram is married in this country, Krishna is married, Yudhishthira is married, you are also married, but both of them married abroad

 After all, where is this thinking coming from? baat baat main dharm kaa virdohi qaraar diya janaa, baat baat main desh kaa virdohi karaara diya janaa

 The comments shanivaar ko jodhpur jail se adaalat main peshi ke liye aae asaram baapu ke paanv ek purv mukhya nyaayadhish esen bhargav ne jaakar chhu liya
 Normally, the police prevent a prisoner from getting close, but Justice Bhargava touched his feet

 Justice Bhargava has also been the Governor of Sikkim
 kya hamane galat ko galat kehane kaa saahas kho diya he yaa ab bahut se log aisi ghatnaon se sahamat hone lage hai, jisamen media bhi shaamil he
 One view may be that these young people should be treated harshly, it should be, but my point of view is different
 muslim sabha or udaipur kii adaalat ke pravesh dwaar par bhagava fahraane vaale sabhi naujavaanon se kisi ko baat karnaa chahie
 Are they upset about not getting a job, how do they get so angry about religion, farmers commit suicide, why don't they get angry about their compassion or system

 You will know only by talking
 police ne udaipur kii ghatana ke maamle main us din 200 logon ko hiraasat main liya tha
 There were many who went there for their court work
 baad main sabhi ko zamaanat par chhod diya gaya
 If a wrong picture of the tricolor is seen, then the Twitter world becomes active
 tivi channelon main tufaan khadaa ho jaataa he
 Can it be so easy for the media and society to forget the Udaipur incident
 sanvaidhanik daayityon se las kisi bhi raajnneetik pahchaan ke nagarikon ko kya is tasviir se satark nahin ho janaa chahie
 We want to show the statement of the IG of Udaipur police which he said while talking to the media on the day of the incident
 haalat yah he ki twit par kuch log mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje kii bhi aalochana karne lage ki unhone pradarshnakariyon par karrwai kyon hone di
 Such arguments are also getting place and people are getting comfortable with such incidents
 kai logon ne is ghatana kii ninda bhi kii
 Do not look at this incident with sentiment or anger, look at it with a cool head and think if we have lost all the opportunities for dialogue
 kya dharmik vajahon ko lekar koi is had tak ugr ho saktaa he ki adaalat kii imaarat ke kareeb pahunch jaae
 Our colleague Munne Bharti spoke to Prashant Bhushan, he also risks speaking first in such cases
 hindu or musalmaan ke bich kai baar takaraav kii naubat aati he
 Taking advantage of such a situation, the crowd should be built, it should be taken to the court, what should have been done, you should consider it
 aisi kisi bhi bheed jise adaalat or kanoon kaa khoff na ho, hamaare samaaj ko kaise badal rahi he
 Everyone should understand how our attitude towards constitutional institutions changes
 main shanivaar ko goa main tha
 Saw a poster on a wall there
 yah poster hindu jan jagriti samiti kaa he
 This poster has written about the honor of the national flag
 kaha gaya he ki plastic ke dhvaj kaa istamaal na karen, chehre or sharir par raashtra dhvaj kii akruti na banaaen
 If found the national flag somewhere, submit it with respect to the government office, but these young men of Udaipur gathered in the name of some unknown Hindu organization and came to the court premises and waved Ram flag on the roof
 kya hindu jaagran samiti ke lihaaz se aisa karnaa raashtra dhvaj kaa sammaan hoga? hamaare saamne do tarah ke hindu sanghathanon kaa nazariyaa, faisla aap kiijie
 Our colleague Sushil Kumar Mohapatra spoke to retired Justice Sodhi
 unhone kaha ki nyaaypalika is tarah se nahin chal sakati he
 Our colleague Himanshu Shekhar Mishra also spoke to Rajya Sabha member and lawyer KTS Tulsi
 hamane rajasthan ke mahadhivaktaa ko bhi phone kiya magar baat nahin hui
 It is expected that the Law Minister of the country or the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court will take cognizance of this incident
 kisi kisi awaazen aa rahi hai
 BJP MLA from Madhya Pradesh's Guna Panna Lal Shakya is giving a speech on why Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma got married outside the country
 vidhayak ji kah rahe hai ki is desh main ram kaa vivaah hua he, krishna kaa hua he, yudhisthir kaa hua he, aap logon kaa bhi hua he, magar donon ne videsh main shaadi kii
 Earned money from here and took money abroad
 aakhir ye soch kahaan se aa rahi he
 Talking about being said to be anti-religion, in talking vidhayak ji jis manch se bhaashan de rahe the, us par pradhanmantri modi kaa hi poster nazar aa rahaa tha
 Another picture came these days

 aam taur par police kisi kaidi ke kareeb jane se rokatii he magar justise bhargav ne unke paanv chhu liye
 Should a former Chief Justice of the High Court have done this, will a good message go to the people towards justice
 justise bhargav sikkim ke rajyapal bhi rah chuke hai
 Have we lost the courage to call the wrong wrong or now many people have started agreeing to such incidents, including the media
 ek nazariyaa yah ho saktaa he ki in naujavaanon se sakhti se pesh aayaa jaae, yah hona chahie magar meraa nazariyaa kuch or bhi he
 Someone should talk to all the youth who hoist saffron at the entrance of Muslim Sabha and Udaipur court
 kya ve naukari na milane se pareshaan hai, unke bheetar dharm ko lekar itnaa gussa kaise aa jaataa he, kisaan aatmahatya karte hai, use lekar unke bheetar karuna yaa system ke prati gussa kyon nahin aata he
 We have to talk to them with an eye, and ask why they are deliberately putting their lives and the lives of others at stake, has any big organization promised them something, someone is promising to save them, What is the matter
 baat karne se hi pataa chalegaa

 In such a situation, why did the Indian government come to light after 34 years of 26 lakh Indians settled in UAE including Dubai? Most Indians settle here and send 50 billion dollars every year to the country
 inke hit, inke adhikaar or bharat ke saath yuai ke aapasi rishte kyon hamaari videsh niti main ab ahm ho gaye hai? Importance is not only of Indians but also of foreign investment coming from Arabia

 The United Arab Emirates has a repository of money for investment that very few countries in the world have specifically set aside for investment
 abu dhabi investment athurity ke paas 800 billian dollar kaa fund khaas taur par nivesh ke liye alag rakhaa gaya he 
 On the same lines, $ 500 billion has been set aside for investment with the Dubai Investment Authority
 ise Sovereign wealth fund kaha jaataa he jo ki duniya bhar main stock, bond, real estate, keemtee dhaatuon ke sector or hej funds main nivesh ke liye alag rakhaa gaya he
 Such funds can form only those countries which have extra money from the budget and which have no international liability

 The mandate of Karnataka has arrived
 vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon main bijepi sabase badi party ke taur ubhari he
 However, just before the magic number needed to form the government, bjp's victory chariot stopped
 congress duusare number par or jedies tisare number par ai he
 In such a situation, a picture of a clearly hung assembly in the state has come out
 haalanki bijepi ko satta se dur rakhane ke liye congress or jedies ne haath mila liya he
 The Congress has announced its support to the JDS by playing a big bet
 jedies ne congress ke samarthan ke sahare rajyapal vajubhai vaala ke saamne sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kar diya he
 The BJP has also reached the Governor
 bies yediurppa ne bahumat sabit karne ke liye rajyapal se 48 ghante kaa samay maanga he
 According to reports, the governor has given Yeddyurappa a time of May 17
 raat nau baje tak aae parinaamon ke mutabik 222 main se bijepi 104 siton ke saath sabase bade dal ke rup main saamne ai he
 Congress is at number two with 78 seats, while JDS has managed to win 37 seats
 isse pehle shaam ko yediurppa ke baad jedies netaa kumaraswami rajyapal se mulaakaat karne pahunche
 Congress leader Siddaramaiah also reached Raj Bhavan in his support
 donon ne rajyapal se mulaakaat ke baad saajha press conference kii or sarkaar banane kaa daawa kiya
 Siddaramaiah arrived in the evening with his fellow leaders to resign in the evening after the election results

 Apart from this, a letter of support has also been submitted to the Governor
 idhar congress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne jedy(es) ke varisht netaa echdi devgauda se phone par baat kii
 Along with this, Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also congratulated Deve Gowda and said that it is expected that JDS will form a government in the state with the Congress

 The BJP high command hopes that as the largest party, the governor will invite BJP to form the government
 rajyapal yediurppa ko shapath ke liye 17 may kaa samay de sakate hai
 According to sources, Kumaraswamy, who won the election on two seats, will pressure BJP to resign from one seat at the earliest
 saath hi is maamle ko rajyapal saamne bhi rakhegi ki vishwaas mat se pehle kumaraswami do jiti hui siton main se ek se istipha den
 In such a situation, information is also coming out that JDS can also take its mlas outside Bengaluru to keep them united
 sutron ke mutabik congress ke lingayat vidhayak bhi bijepi ke sampark main hai
 If the Congress supports Kumaraswamy to become the Chief Minister, then the Lingayat mlas of the Congress can remain absent on the confidence vote
 bijepi kii ore se bhi morchabandihalanki bhaajapa bhi karnataka ko aasaani se apane haath se nikalne nahin degi
 The BJP has also started a barricade in the state
 kai kaddavar netaa pehle se rajya main maujuud hai or dharmendra pradhan, jepi nadda, prakaash jaavdekar jaise netaa bhi bengalooru pahunch gaye hai
 The election of Karnataka has become a question of prestige for both parties
 abhi tak ke rujhaanon or parinaamon ko dekhte hue kisi ko spasht bahumat miltaa nazar nahin aa rahaa he
 It seems that no one is currently in a position to form a government without the help of JDS
 bhaajapa bhale hi kuch der pehle tak jashn main dubi nazar aa rahi thi, lekin ab donon hi dalon kaa sara dhyaan sarkaar banane kii koshishon par he or tab tak ke liye jashn kii gunjaaishein bhi thamati nazar aa rahi hai
 Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, who came from outside with Siddaramaiah on the afternoon of the verdict on the mandate said, "we have spoken with Deve Gowda and Kumaraswamy over the phone and they have agreed in principle support
" jedy(es) sarkaar kaa netritv karegi or donon partiyaan ek saath rajyapal se mulaakaat karengi
 Siddaramaiah said that we will support the JDS from outside
 bataa den ki siddharmaiya sarkaar main urja mantri rahe dike sivakumar ne mulabagal se nirdaleey vidhayak ech

 As soon as the signal from Delhi, the Chief Minister's residence in Bangalore was turned into a war room
 congress ne jedies ke saath baatcheet ko lekar apane sabhi daravaaje khol die
 The party's attempt was to tell the JD (S) that the Congress would be a better option for it under any circumstances
 jedies kaa phaaydabhale hi rajya vidhansabha chunaav main jedies tisare paaydaan par khadi najar aati he lekin ab wo kingmekar se khud king banane kii bhi sthiti main he
 For Kumaraswamy, going with the Congress and becoming the Chief Minister and forming a government will be a more profitable deal
 aise main 2019 ke liye bhi khud ke liye sambhaavnaaen dekh rahe hai
 Give the latest trends and results that BJP has an edge over 104 seats
 udhar congress ko 78 siton par badhat hasil he
 JD (S), the third major party in the election, also has an edge over 38 seats
 chunaav ayog kii ore se jari aankadon ke mutabik raat saadhe nau baje tak bijepi ne 103 siton par jeet hasil kar lee he
 The Congress has won 78 seats
 iske alaava jedy(es) ne 37 or bahujan samaaj party (basapa) or karnataka prajaiyavantha janata party (KPJP) ne 1-1 seat par jeet hasil kii he
 The counting of votes in 222 seats of the state assembly with 224 seats began at 8 am on Tuesday
 congress kaa ahankarasbase dilachasp baat yah he ki abhi tak chunaav ayog kii ore se jari aakadon ke mutabik congress party ko bhartiya janata party se zyaada vot mili hai
 But there is a difference of more than 20 seats between the two parties
 jedies ko mil rahi badhat ke baad ab raajnneetik visheshgyon ne kahana shuru kar diya he ki congress ko uskaa ahankaar le duba

 It was a period of controversy, nowadays the scope is of controversies, i also want to be disputed, if there are no controversies, then you would have paid attention to what the Prime Minister was wearing? So the suit was auctioned and the rupees that would be used to clean the Ganges would be more clean
 It is also a wonderful work, even after a hundred years, elections can be fought on the promise of this work, sometimes some work is done only because if they are done then we should not be able to remember the old days
 jab ganga gandi thi

 suut nilaam ho gaya,thode kaam or honge phir shaayad murde na bahe,ghar baithe aapako kya fark padataa he? ganga aap thode gandi karte hai na pradhanmantri gandi karte hai, shaayad aap karte hai
 But the Prime Minister will get it cleaned, the suit was not auctioned in crores! 4

 Applied after 31 or after 4
 pradhanmantri kaa suut charchaa main aakar nilaam ho gaya, yuvaraj singh bina charchaa main aae nilaam ho gaye, yuvaraj ke pita nilaam na hokar bhi charchaa main aa gaye, sangakaara na charchaa main aae na nilaam ho paa aae, nilaam na ho paane kaa dukh tab or salata he jab aap suut ho janaa chaahate hai,keemat to mili
 But as soon as the suit was auctioned, other leaders have given their things to the auction, the new Chief Minister has a muffler, Baba's Baba is the suit, Sister Ji's purse is the sandal that used to come from airplanes, and that is the youth But the elders lead the party, they have not given anything to the auction, but it seems that the remaining part of the party will be auctioned

 Announcing this proposal on Thursday in his native villages Baniyani and Nindana in the district, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said that his government is committed to fulfill its promise of providing 24-hour power supply in Haryana
 khatter ne kaha ki haryana ke gaanvon main nirbaadh bijli aapurti ke liye jahaan meter lagaae ja rahe hai or kharaab transformaron ko badla ja rahaa he, vahiin graminon se bhi unhone apil kii ki ve line los ko 20 fisadi tak kam karen
 Even today, the village that he once adopted in 2014 is still waiting for Rahul Gandhi, who is busy in the exercise of winning power in the Lok Sabha elections 2019
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne ‘saansad adarsh gram yojana' ke tahat amethi ke jagadishpur gaanv ko god liya tha or aaj paanch saal baad yahaan ke graminon kaa kahana he ki ve congress adhyaksh ke aagaman kaa or vikaas kaary shuru hone kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi last visited Jagdishpur in December 2014 when he adopted the village
 gaanv main rahane vaale kesari nandan ne kaha, ‘rahul gandhi keval 2014 main ek baar aae the
 At that time every tree, pillar and road were measured as if development work would take place
 lekin tab se kuch nahin hua
 'under the Sansad Adarsh gram Yojana, Members of Parliament had to adopt a village in their parliamentary constituency and develop it like Adarsh gram
 is gaanv main gaddhedaar sadaken hai, pipe se pani kii aapurti kaa koi praavdhaan nahin he
 Health plans are also negligible
 rahul gandhi ke phir aane kaa intjaar karne kii baat karne vaale gram pradhan jitendra yadav haal hi main bhaajapa main shaamil ho gayi
 He said that he left the party after being isolated by the Congress leadership a few months ago
 unhone kaha, ‘hamaara gaanv dashakon tak gandhi parivaar ke saath khadaa rahaa
 We have played a big role in winning Rahul Gandhi again and again
 lekin jab ham ek saamudayik centre kii maang ke saath unase milane gayi to unhone hamaare saath 30 sacand bhi nahin gujaarey
 Our request was put on hold
 ' yadav ke anusaar hataash hokar unhone congress chhod di
 He said, 'if our mps cannot listen to the people of a village, how will they listen to the people of the whole society? He may be the Congress president but he has not been the president of the public
 ' yadav ne aarope lagaaya ki gandhi ‘raja' kii tarah kaam karte hai lekin log ab unhen is tarah nahin lenge
 Many citizens of the village believe that the Congress President could have done a lot as an MP here
 graminon ne bataaya ki gaanv waalon ko svachh peyajal muhaiyaa karaane ke liye haal hi main ek pani kii tank aavantit kii gayi thi lekin nalon main abhi tak pani nahin aayaa he
 According to housewife Prema, 'rahul Gandhi should have done something for us
 hamen unase bahut ummiden thim
 But he did not spend anything from his MP fund here
 junglee jaanavar hamaari fasalon ko barbaad kar rahe hai lekin hamaari madad ke liye koi nahin he
 Expressing displeasure with Rahul Gandhi, many villagers are coming from Amethi to BJP candidate and Union Minister Smriti Irani for help
 gaanv ke bujurg virendra shankar mishra ne bataaya ki smriti 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main haarane ke baad bhi jagadishpur aati raheen
 He said, 'when Rahul Gandhi left his adopted village after winning from Amethi in 2014, Smriti Irani kept coming to us
 pichhali baar jab rahul gandhi kii jeet kaa antar kam ho gaya to yah unke liye chetavanee thi lekin spasht he ki unhone is par koi dhyaan nahin diya
 ' gaanv waalon ne kaha ki unhen bhaajapa kii ujjwala yojana jaise kaaryakramon se phayda hua he
 However, Yogendra Mishra, president of Amethi unit of Congress, came to the rescue of Rahul Gandhi, saying that the government did not provide separate funds for the MP Adarsh gram Yojana
 unhone kaha, ‘sarkaar ko iske liye alag se dhan dena chahie tha or rahul ji ne yah baat pehle hi din kahi thi
 How can an MP spend the entire amount of his MP fund on only one village and leave the other villages in the region? ”let the Amethi seat, which is considered a Congress stronghold, go to polls on May 6
 rahul gandhi chauthi baar yahaan se loksabhaa pahunchane ke liye prayaas kar rahe hai
