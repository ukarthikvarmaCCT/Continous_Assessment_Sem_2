 pakistan kii is harakat ko kya naam den? nafrat, bujadili, dushmani yaa phir kuch or? taarikh gavaah he, yun chhipakar hamalaa karnaa ab uski fitrat ban gai he
 And now he does not back down from wearing military uniforms even to terrorists
 lekin ham apane un siyasatdanon kaa kya karen, jinhen pakistan ke aise har hamale ke baad munh tod jawaab dene kaa jumala bolte-bolte ek puri umr guzar gai
 Now again the bullet is on the outskirts, and now once again the crop of things is flowing
 nafrat kii buniyaad par khinchi gai hindustan or pakistan kii sarhad kii lakiron ke upar aaj bhi nafrat haaavee he
 Leave a good neighbor, even a good enemy did not expect such enmity which Pakistan showed
 raat ke andhere main kaayar kii tarah hamalaa kiya or andhere main hi gum ho gaya
 Fighting on the border, killing and killing during the defense of the border is the duty of every military
 par javaanon ke bich aatankwaadiyon ko dhaal bana kar yun hamalaa karnaa ye phogiyon kaa kaam nahin he
 Sadly, Pakistan has been doing this work for a long time
 padhein:navaj sharif kaa plan K: ghuspaith karo, magar pakistan sarkaar par aanch na aejammu-kashmir ke poonch sector main tadake saadhe teen baje pakistan ke mujahid regiment ne chakkaan da baag ke sarala post par gasht kar rahe bhartiya phogiyon ko teen taraf se gherkar hamalaa bol diya
 Our troop was small
 bahaduree se loha lete hue paanch jawan shahid ho gaye
 But later it was learned that the Pak army had carried out this attack with the terrorists of Lashkar and jaish-e-mohammad and Hafiz Saeed was the mastermind of this attack
 hamale kaa makasad tha hamale kii aad main paak aatankwaadiyon ko bhartiya sarhad main ghusaanaa
 This martyrdom has once again questioned our strength
 kya sarhad par hamaara ravaiya hamen kamjor mulk kii qatari main khadaa kar detaa he? kya ham har hamale ke baad bas aise hi badi-badi baaten karte rahenge? sansad bhawan main baith kar bas dushmano ko dhamkaate rahenge? yaa kuch karenge bhi? or karenge to kab?padhein:wo 5 maaren to tum 50 maaro, goli kaa jawaab goli se do: shahanvajasfed jhooth jaisaa lafj shaayad pakistan jaison ke liye bana he
 Otherwise, how was it possible that the Pakistan soldiers and the terrorists of Hafiz Saeed killed the five soldiers of India together, the same Pakistan has maintained that nothing has happened on the loc
 sawaal ye uthta he ki phir raat ke andhere main pakistan kii taraf se goli akhir chalaai kisne?kuch din pehle hafiz said ne bharat ko lalakaara tha
 Despite this, Pakistan is neither agreeing to the hand of its army nor Hafiz Saeed
 hindustani sainikon kii shahadat apane-aap main pakistan kii is bujadili kaa sabase bada subut he
 If sources are to be believed, it was Hafiz Saeed's lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammed terrorists who, along with the Pakistani army, ambushed the Indian soldiers
 sabase chaunkaane vaali baat ye he ki is hamale se chand roj pehle hi pichley maheene hafiz said bharat-pakistan border par pakistani phogiyon ke saath dekha gaya tha
 Just like Saeed was seen on the border just before the incident of beheading of Indian soldiers on 8 January this year
 darasal, poonch sector ke chakkaan da baag ke paas hindustani fouj ko pakistan kii ore se ghuspaith kii khabar mili thi
 In view of this, an ambush contingent of Bihar Regiment was patrolling the area
 isse pehle ki unhen kisi ghuspaith kaa pataa chalata, kareeb 400 meter andar ghuskar pakistani fouj or aatankwaadiyon ne un par goliyaan barasaani shuru kar deen
 It is suspected that under the cover of this attack, some terrorists managed to enter into India by infiltrating
 haalanki ab tak is ghuspaith kii kisi ne tasdik nahin kii he
 Militant and Pakistani army are starting to have two sides of the same coin
 samaj main nahin aata he ki pakistani fouj aatankwaadiyon ke haath main he yaa phir aatankwaadi paak fouj ke haathon main
 Because this is not the first time that Pakistan has stabbed in the back of India

 jabaki sena kii press relies main kaha gaya he ki hathiyaaron se las kareeb 20 aatankwaadiyon ne hamalaa bolaa, jinke saath kuch pakistani faujee bhi the

 or inhen aatankwaadiyon ke saath milakar kaayar pakistani phogiyon ne 5 agast kii raat bharat ke javaanon par teen taraf se hamalaa bol diya, jisamen paanch jawan shahid ho gaye
 However, Pakistan probably does not know that it was sitting on the ammo of terror
 use lagata he ki us barood se wo bharat ko jhulasaayegaa, lekin nahin jaanata ki jis din aatank kaa wo barood fata, pakistan ke hi chithde-chithde ho jaaenge

 upi ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kii jubaan par dil kii baat aa hi gai, aakhirkaar unhone bol hi diya ki tikat baantne kaa adhikaar unako chahie
 Actually, this was the whole controversy
 sabhi jaanate hai ki, samaajawaadee party ke sanghathan main shivpal yadav kii khaasi pakad he
 Therefore, the future of SP, Akhilesh has always wanted that his hold in the organization is the strongest, that is, he wants to transfer Mulayam's Samajwadi Party to Samajwadi Party
 darasal 2012 main zyaadaatar tiktashivpalane hi baante the
 In such a situation, he had a lot of interest in government and organization
 shivpal ke mukaable akhilesh apni nai chhavi ke saath aage badhanaa chaahate hai, jisamen wo dabangai, gundgardee or bhrashtachar se ekadam dur saaf chhavi chaahate hai
 Be it DP Yadav or Mukhtar Ansari, he does not want to take them along
 amar singh se bhi wo ek nishchit duuri chaahate hai, ajam khan kii kattarta unako pasand nahin, unki tamaam baton se wo pallaa jhaad lete hai
 Akhilesh himself will choose his team, just before the election, he decided that in future he will make his team according to his own
 iske liye jaruri he ki tikat wo baante or sarkaar bane tokhilesh kii timahi unke saath ho jo akhilesh ke hisaab se chale
 But even if power does not come, the winning mlas will be their supporters and they will have a grip on the organization
 tikat bantwaare ko lekar tha sara vivadavaise mulaayam ne apane saath ke tamaam netaaon ko rajyasabha dekar pehle hi dilli bhejkar 2012 se hi akhilesh kii raah aasaan karne koshish shuru kar di thi
 But Shivpal's hold on the organization and Azam's Muslim face kept protecting him, but mulayam-akhilesh and Ram Gopal's latest stakes were for the exercise to give Akhilesh the right to distribute tickets in the election, so that Mulayam's complete reins of Akhilesh The dream of handing over could be realized
 akhilesh bane harkar jeetne vaale baazeegaryahi vajah he ki masalaa sulajhane ke naam par or ulajhata ja rahaa he
 Regardless of the position, position or department, Shivpal or his close acquires, think that he has bowed to Netaji and Akhilesh
 siyaasi ladaai main tikat baantne kaa adhikaar hasil karne ke baad asal jeet akhilesh kii hogi
 Overall, even though the victory is seen by Shivpal today, Akhilesh is the only juggler to win by losing

 The Indian economy achieved the fastest growth rate of around 8 percent in any quarter in its recorded history in 2008-11
 isse pehle sirf ek baar is tarah kii vruddhi darj kii gai thi
 It was a year of the last years of the 1980s, which was in fact immediately followed by one of the worst droughts in recorded history
 usamen agrani kshetra the utpaadan or khanan
 Following behind were the construction and government sectors
 darasal desh ke hisaab-kitaab main yah chaalaaki barti jaati he ki sarkaar kaa vittiya ghaataa uske kul kharch main jod diya jaataa he or isliye vah rashtriya kharch main ahm yogadan karata he
 Therefore, the increase in the fiscal deficit increases both national spending and income
 upie sarkaar ne 2008-2010 main is kadar haath kholkar kharch kiya maano kal kii kisko phikr he
 So, it was also an important reason for the unexpected growth rate of that period
 us bulandi ke baad vikaas dar ludhakni shuru ho gai
 According to my calculations, which is slightly more sophisticated than the year-on-year quarterly growth rate calculation by the Central Statistical Office (CSO), the annual growth rate fell to below 5 per cent by the end of 2013
 uske baad giravat thami
 For the quarters of 2014 for which we have figures, the growth rate is 4
 2 se 4
 9 and then 5
 2 fisadi ho gai
 The trend of growth in GDP was further accelerated, which was 4 in the last quarter of 2013
 8 fisadi se badhkar 2014 kii pehali teen timahiyon main 6
 1, 7
 4 or 6
 9 percent
 is teevr vikaas dar ko nijee upbhog main vruddhi ne chadhaaya
 The investment that increased productive capacity remained stagnant throughout that period
 bhugtan santulan main bhi thodi giravat dekhne ko mili
 But she was so little that she did not have much effect
 2010 ke baad kii giravat main udyog kshetra kaa haath tha
 Six years ago, its production was growing at a rate of about ten per cent
 2012 main vastav main utpaadan main giravat aa gai
 The decline that began three years ago continues
 audyogic utpaadan main koi ullekhneey vruddhi nahin ho rahi
 Yet GDP is registering a respectable growth of 6-7 per cent
 aisa kaise hota he? ek udyog jo salanaa 6 fisadi kii dar se bad rahaa he, vah he krishi
 We know how this production is also increasing - the government is buying millions of tons of food grains and suppressing them in stocks forever
 uske alaava saarvajanik sevaaon main vruddhi ho rahi he jo mukhya rup se urja utpaadan or vitaran ke chalate he
 But the fastest growing sector is financial services, which is growing at a rate of 10 per cent every year
 is kshetra main aakhir badhotaree koun rahaa he, koun-si sevaayen hai or kinako vah bech rahaa he, ye sab rahasy he
 If we review all the data, then the conclusion is that everything is collapsing
 pehali baat, audyogic utpaadan ke vistrut aankade bataate hai ki ve gir rahe hai; rashtriya aankade dikhaate hai ki unamem kareeb 2 fisadi kii vruddhi ho rahi he
 There is no match between the two
 duusare, jidipi main vruddhi ko upabhokta khapat main teji se madad mil rahi he; lekin yah spasht nahin ki upabhokta aakhir badi taadaad main kharid kya rahe hai
 Of course they cannot be agricultural products because the National Sample Survey shows that per capita food consumption had reached a peak two years earlier
 vah utpaadan kshetra kaa bhi nahin ho saktaa kyonki uski vruddhi dar to gir rahi he
 The service sector remains
 isamen gunjaaish naammumkin nahin he
 But the number of TV channels has reached a peak
 bollywood se nikalne vaali filmon kii sankhya bhi nahin bad rahi
 Tourism is booming but not so much that it can make such a difference
 isiilie upabhokta khapat main vruddhi rahasyamay he
 Thirdly, the CSO has set a new base of GDP figures
 usne buniyadi aankadon main bhi amulchul badlaav kiya he
 But without any explanation it is difficult to express any confidence in them
 nishkarsh yah ki utpaadan ke aankadon ke anusaar to jidipi main giravat kaa daur jari he, lekin kharch ke aankadon ke anusaar yah giravat tham gai he
 The possible explanation for this is that the government is putting a dent in the purchasing power of consumers in the form of indirect taxes, it does not make any sense
 mere man main sarkari aankadebaajon ke liye bahut sammaan he lekin pichley do saal main sarkaar ne jo aankade saamne rakhe hai, ve darasal mail nahin khate
 The Finance Minister has to understand the performance of the economy to decide the focus of the budget
 agar sthiti sphitikari he to unhen arthvyavastha ko avasfiti kii ore le janaa hoga yaa ulat sthiti main duusari taraf
 In his interim budget, he retained the proportion of the fiscal deficit set by his predecessor Congress minister
 ekmaatr badlaav unhone yah kiya ki pichhali sarkaron ke labhaarthiyon kii jagah apane kareebi logon ko rakh liya or kai party shubhachintakon ko 50-100 karod ru
 Give it away vitt mantri yahi kaam apane agle bajet main bhi kar sakate hai
 But many reasons will prevent them from doing so
 pehla he udyog jagat
 Industries are in bad shape and need rescue measures
 duusare hai pradhanmantri, jo harek ko 'mek in india' ke jariye yuva logon ko rojgaar dene ke liye kah rahe hai
 He would expect an expansionary budget that would encourage the production sector
 tisare hai, ve arthshaastri jinhen sarkaar mukhya aarthik salaahkaar or niti ayog ke pramukh ke taur par lekar ai he
 These people have left their flourishing careers abroad and have come to India with high hopes
 ve apana asar chhodana chahenge
 Arun can also look at Jaitley and greater expectations and would like to leave his mark as Finance Minister
 agar vah aisa sochate hai to kai sari baaten unke dhyaan dene ke liye hai
 Their first priority should be Goods and Services Tax (GST)
 unhone kaha tha ki unki sarkaar ko donon sadanon main bahumat hasil hoga or vah april tak jaruri kanoon bana lenge
 They cannot fulfill their promise
 bahumat kii baat bhuulakar unhen aam raay banane kii disha main dhyaan dena chahie
 They should negotiate with the major opposition parties for support
 2015 main jiesti ko lagu karke unhen saamaan kii mukt awajahi main rajyon kii simaaon par sabhi sarkari baadhaon ko hataa dena chahie
 They should ask Suresh Prabhu about the plans to modernize, expand and speed up the railways and provide them with funds for investment
 lekin rajmargon ke maamle main gunjaaish usase bhi zyada he
 The delhi-mumbai Industrial Corridor has played a big role towards industrializing Gujarat and Rajasthan
 yah prerak tatv anya mahanagaron ke bich rajmargon-mumbai-pune-bengalooru-chennai, mumbai-nagpur-kolkata, purv or pashchim tateey rajmargon kaa sudhaar karke desh ke baaki hisson tak bhi le janaa chahie
 Jaitley should also revive the highway plan to Sri Lanka
 unhen mizoram, meghalaya or tripura se bangladesh hote hue pashchim bengal tak haive banane kii disha main badhanaa chahie
 But the international highways would be useless if the Indian Customs Department remains hostile
 jetali ko sabhi padosi deshon ke saath ekatarfa mukt vyapaar kii shuruyaat kerani chahie-jo bhi padosi hon, unke liye seemaa-shulk or anya aayaat paabandiyaan hataa deni chahie
 This will bring them closer and they will see their interests in India
 bhale hi isse bharat ko unka niryaat doguna ho jaae, lekin hamaare bhugtan santulan kii sthiti main usase koi aanch aane vaali nahin he
 On the contrary, it will reshape our economic relations
 bharat main jidipi se vyapaar kaa anupaat duniya main sabase kam he
 This is mainly due to its import system
 is vajah se bandargahon main alp-nivesh hua he
 There are few natural ports in India, trade among them is quite restricted
 jetali ko majhole aakaar ke darjan bhar bandargah banane ke liye dhan uplabdh karana chahie
 Also, ships with a capacity of 80,000 tonnes will also have to be built which can use those ports
 unhen gharelu vyapaar ke bade hisse ko jameen se hataane kaa lakshya bananaa chahie or hind mahaasaagar ke jariye vyapaar ke vistaar ke liye dhaancha khadaa karnaa chahie
 The biggest hurdles facing Indian industry are the over-regularized and under-developed financial markets
 bharat main kai bachatakarta or kai sampann vyakti hai, lekin vittiya madhyasthata ke tareeke itane lachar hai ki jo sampann hai ve baahar nivesh karte hai or baaki real estate main paisa laga dete hai
 As a result, the ratio between land prices and per capita GDP in India is very high in terms of international standards
 bharat sabase puraane or sabase sakriy puunji bazaaron main se ek he
 Then, in the name of reforms, he started putting up regulators one after the other
 shram saadhy or kaagajon se laden sebi jaise niamak ne puunji bazaar ko khatm kar diya he or bagaiyr puunji bazaar ke band bazaar nahin ubhar saktaa
 Jaitley should ask SEBI to reduce its regulations by 90 per cent, returning all the bureaucrats he has held on deputation
 use britain, singapore, honkong or lagjamberg jaise safal vittiya udyogon vaale deshon kii halki-phulki niyaman pranali se siikhnaa chahie
 i have many other suggestions, but there is no point in wasting them now
 agar jetali khud ko samajhane laayak sabit karte hai to unhen suzav dene ke or bhi kai maukey honge kyonki is baat kii sambhaavna kam hi he ki yah sarkaar giregi yaa pradhanmantri apane vitt mantri se chhutkaaraa paaenge

 Lara said, i know that he is already out of the Twenty20 format of the game
 mujhe pakkaa pataa nahin he ki vah abhi 50 over ke match khel rahe hai yaa nahin, lekin jahaan tak test cricket kaa sawaal he to vah abhi do saal or khel sakate hai
 He can still score a lot of runs in Test and one-day international cricket

 jisane, mujhe pakkaa pataa nahin he ki 15 yaa 16 saal se (antarrashtriya) cricket khelnaa shuru kiya ho or vah abhi khel rahaa he
 In this way he started playing a year or two before me and even after five years of my retirement he is still playing
 lara ne kaha, vah antarrashtriya cricket main 25 saal puure karne ke kareeb hai tathaa keval sachin ko hi nahin, balki saare bharatiyon ko is par garv hona chahie
 Lara, who scored 11,953 runs in a total of 131 Tests, holds the record for scoring the most 400 runs in an innings of Test matches

 Devang came out with a different way of earning money, in which no money is required, nor is there any loss
 devang or sandhya ne lav marij kiya he
 Both of them have chosen this path to run home and fulfill their hobbies
 rajkot ke malviya nagar police stesan main ek cese aayaa, jise sulajhane ke dauraan sandhya rawal or devang rawal, donon pakde gaye
 They used to trap the boys by SMS, then threaten to defame them and complain to the police

 ravivaar yani surya kii upasna kaa din he isiilie ham aapako bataa rahe hai surya dev ko prasann karne kaa mahaamantra
 So let's know the divine mantras of worshiping the Almighty Sun, which will give a new flight to your education and career
 jaankaron kii maane to keval surya kii upasna karke insaan apane jivan ko sarvottam bana saktaa he
 Surya worship is considered to be the most important, especially to get the highest position in the field of education, so today we will tell you what is the relationship between Surya and education and how you will gain knowledge through meditation of Surya on Sunday
 
 
 surya dev or shiksha kaa sambandh- surya shiksha or gyaan kaa swaabhaavik swami he
 - Sun in the horoscope clarifies the state of education
 - surya ye bhi bataata he ki aap shiksha ke prati kitne gambhir hai
 - Sun also makes a person capable of learning
 - surya ke kamjor hone se shiksha praapt karne main samasyaayein aati hai
 The worship of Sun God is considered the best for education, but let us know how Surya gets his blessings of education
 
 
 surya kaise denge shiksha kaa vardaan- subah jaldi uthne par- saafe-suthere tareeke se rahane par- surya kii raushnee kaa laabh uthaane par- pita or gurujanon kaa sammaan karne par- khan-paan shuddh rakhane parjankaron kii maane to insaan kii shiksha kisi hogi, ye kundali main surya kii sthiti se saaf pataa chalata he lekin kuch aadaten bhi hai jinke kaaran insaan surya krupa se vanchit rah jaataa he or uski shiksha badtar ho jaati he
 When comes the obstacle in education - sleeping till late after sunrise - in the dark house or in the room - not respecting your father - lying down, reading and writing - eating more than full stomach and worshiping the sun for best education- Cleanse should be bathed daily before sunrise
 - nahaane ke baad suryanarayan ko teen baar arghya dekar pranaam karen
 - In the evening, offer prayers to the Sun again
 - surya ke kisi bhi mantra kaa shraddhapurvak jaap karen- aditya hriday kaa niyamit paath karen
 - Oil and salt should not be eaten on Sunday- On this day, one should eat only
 surya upasna main aapaki shiksha or kariyar se judi har samasya kaa samaadhaan chupa he
 Chanting any of these mantras can make your life radiant like the Sun

 ’’ Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh has got a big relief on the occasion of World Tribal Day
 adivaasiyon ne unhen apana netaa sweekaar kar barason puraani adivasee mukhyamantri kii maang ko sire se khaarij kar diya he
 The tribal leaders have made it clear that Chief Minister Raman Singh is acceptable to them
 kyonki unhone jitna kaam adivaasiyon ke kalyaan ke liye kiya utana puraani kisi bhi sarkaar ne nahin kiya
 Actually, since the formation of Chhattisgarh, there was a demand for tribal chief minister in the state
 vidhansabha chunaav ke thik pehle adivaasiyon ke is rukh ko bijepi ke liye bada kadam mana ja rahaa he
 The main function of World Tribal Day held in Raipur has proved to be a milestone for the BJP government of the state
 indoor stadium main rajya bhar se jute sabhi bade adivasee netaaon ne manch par mukhyamantri raman singh ko gajamala pahanaakar apana netaa sweekaar kiya
 He was welcomed very kindly
 mahilaon, purushon or naujavaanon ne phool maala pahanaakar garmjoshi ke saath unka swaagat kiya
 Adorned with traditional dance and tribal folk arts, the World Tribal Day Festival was completely colorful
 mukhyamantri raman singh bhi gadgad dikhaai die
 He kept smiling throughout the program
 gaanv-kasbon se aaye adivasee netaaon ke alaava sarguja or bastar kii pahadiyon se bhi yahaan adivasee samudaay ke log jute the
 Socially, all the leaders not only gave their support to Chief Minister Raman Singh, but he was patted on the back of what he has done for the development of tribals in 15 years, as never before
 chaahe koi bhi sarkaar rahi ho lekin wo adivaasiyon ke liye utani samvedansheel nahin rahi jis prakaar raman singh or unki sarkaar ne dhayaan diya
 Therefore, the tribals unanimously considered Chief Minister Raman Singh not only as their leader but as a social brother
 bastar main chahumukhi vikaas ke liye adivaasiyon ne sirf raman singh ko hi shrey diya, balki lagbhag 30 hajaar bacchon ko muft shiksha or suvidhaayen jutakar unke bheetar padhai kii lalak banaaye rakhane ke prayaason ke liye kai logon ne mukhyamantri kaa aabhaar mana
 It was announced from the forum that after a long time, tribal children raised the value of Bastar by winning the UPSC examinations
 raipur kaa indoor stadium main mukhya vipakshi dal congress ke vidhayakon ko chhod shesh sabhi dalon ko raajnneetik kaaryakrtta, vidhayak or netaaon ne is kaarykram main shirkat kii
 The entire cabinet of Chief Minister Raman Singh was also present here
 is maukey par aadisasi samudaay ke mantriyon ne raman singh ko hi apana asli rahanuma bataaya
 According to these leaders, there is a difference of sky in the tribal society 15 years ago and now
 unke mutabik samaajik, bauddhik, aarthik or duusare sabhi morcho par adivaasiyon kii bhalaai ke liye raman singh ne koi kasar baaki nahin chodi he
 Based on the 2011 census, the population of tribals in Chhattisgarh was estimated at 32 percent
 jo 2018 main bad kar 35 fisadi se zyada ho gayi he
 Since the formation of the state in 2001, there was a tussle between the government and the tribals for demanding the tribal chief minister and giving him proper leadership
 congress ne bataur adivasee ajit jogi ko mukhyamantri banaaya tha
 But in the year 2003, BJP had rejected Raman Singh as the Chief Minister, and the demand of the tribal Chief Minister was unheard
 iske baad se yah maang kabhi saamaajik manchon or adivaasiyon ke raajnneetik andolanon main uthati rahi
 But just before the assembly elections, this demand was rejected due to the bjp's life in tribal areas
 adivasee netaaon ne daawa kiya he ki bastar or sarguja kii sabhi vidhansabha siton par is baar bijepi kaa paracham laharaayega
 Because his social brother Raman Singh has to be made the chief minister once again

 The debate is over

 If the court secures the decision in this case on Wednesday, then there is every possibility of a decision in this matter also in the month of January itself

 Now Lalu has no other option but to knock the door of the High Court for surety

 Lalu Prasad Prasad Yadav was facing trial in Ranchi in five cases related to the fodder scam, including the conviction of him and Jagannath Mishra on September 30, 2013 in the case of illegal withdrawal of Rs 37 crore, Rs 70 lakh from the Chaibasa treasury
 After five years imprisonment, Rs 25 lakh fine and four years imprisonment have been sentenced on October 3 respectively

 After this, speculation started as to whether the Central Government was going to abolish Article 35-A
 is par siyasat bhi shuru ho gai
 Mehbooba Mufti said that tampering with 35A is equivalent to handing ammo
 umr abdulla samet tamaam kashmiri netaaon ne 35-e ke saath kisi bhi chhedchhad se bachane kii salaah di
 Here it becomes necessary to know what is Article 35-A
 desh bhar main ise hataane ke liye aawaaj kyon uth rahi he or agar ye hatataa he to isse kashmiri netaaon ko aapatti kyon he
 How the matter of discussion became a matter of fact is going on in the Supreme Court as well
 haalanki, isapar faisla abhi aayaa nahin he
 a petition was filed in the Supreme Court in 2014 against Article 35-A 5 years ago
 tab se ye maamla desh main bahes or kashmir main virodh kaa centre bana hua he
 In such a situation it becomes necessary to understand what is Article 35-A of the Constitution related to Kashmir and why it is being described as the root of separatism in Kashmir
 mul samvidhan kaa hissaa nahin tha ye anuchheounuchhed 35-A ko aazaadee ke 7 saal baad yani 1954 main samvidhan main joda gaya tha
 These paragraphs were on the recommendation of the Nehru cabinet by the then President Dr
 rajendra prasad ke ek aadesh se samvidhan main joda gaya tha
 The basis for this is the Delhi Agreement signed in 1952 between Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and the then Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Sheikh Abdullah
 jisamen bhartiya naagarikta ke maamle ko jammu-kashmir ke sandarbh main rajya kaa vishay mana gaya
 What gives special rights? This Article 35-A is the Article of the Constitution under which the rules are fixed for the permanent residents of Kashmir
 is anuchhed ke tahat kashmir ke sthaayee nivaasiyon ko vishesh adhikaar or suvidhaayen di gai hai jo ki naukariyon, sampatti kii kharid-viraasat, scolership, sarkari madad or kalyankari yojanaon se judi suvidhaon se sambandhit hai
 This Article of the President was issued under Article 370 (1) (d) of the Constitution
 ye praavdhaan raashtrapati ko jammu-kashmir ke maamle main rajya ke vishay par samvidhan main aavashyaktaa padane par badlaavon or chhot dene kaa adhikaar detaa he
 The account related to Article 35-A is that while making it, it was added to the Constitution by order of the President instead of the process of making laws from the parliamentary system
 jabaki samvidhan kaa anuchhed 368 (i)samvidhan main kisi bhi sanshodhan kaa adhikaar sirf sansad ko detaa he
 In 1961, the matter came before the court whether the President had the right to amend the Constitution by bypassing the Parliament under 370
 haalanki adaalat ke faisle main is baat kaa tab jawaab nahin mila tha
 On the basis of what arguments the court challenged? In 2014, an NGO filed a petition in the Supreme Court terming this article as a provision against the spirit of India and promoting separatism
 is yachika main anuchhed 35A or anuchhed 370 kii vaidhaniktaa ko chunauti di gai thi
 In this petition, it was argued that after independence, the Constituent Assembly was formed to make the constitution of the country, including 4 representatives of Jammu and Kashmir
 saath hi jammu-kashmir rajya ko kabhi bhi special status nahin diya gaya
 It was also argued that 35-A was a temporary provision which was added to stabilize the situation in the state at that time
 is anuchhed ko samvidhan ke nirmaataaon ne nahin banaaya
 Why is it alleged to promote separatism The petition also said that this article makes distinctions between citizens and weakens the thinking of one India
 ye anuchhed baaki rajyon ke logon ko jammu-kashmir main naukari hasil karne, sampatti kharidne se roktaa he jo ki samvidhan main die gaye mul adhikaron kaa ulanghan he
 Every citizen of the country has been given Fundamental Rights in Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution
 isi ke saath daayar ek anya yachika main jammu-kashmir kii mahilaon ke bahari shaks se shaadi karne par unke bacchon ko naagarikta nahin milane ke praavdhaan ko bhi chunauti di gai he
 The provisions of this law were sought to be rejected, terming the promotion of separatism in Kashmir
 darasal kashmir main siyaasi dalon main ise khatm karne kii ashankaon ko dekhte hue ubaal isi kaa nateeja he
 Because it will prevent separatism and will also hurt the vote bank of local parties
 kya praavdhaan hai anuchhed 35-e main:-anuchhed 35-A se jammu kashmir rajya ke liye sthaayee naagarikta ke niyam or nagarikon ke adhikaar tay hote hai-jammu kashmir sarkaar un logon ko sthai nivasee maanati he jo 14 may 1954 ke pehle kashmir main bas gaye the-aise sthai nivaasiyon ko rajya main jameen kharidne, rojgaar hasil karne or sarkari yojanaon main laabh ke liye adhikaar mili hai
 - a resident of another state cannot settle in Jammu and Kashmir as a permanent resident - Residents of another state can neither buy land in Kashmir, nor can the state government give them a job - if a woman from Jammu and Kashmir If you marry a person from any other state of India, then his rights are taken away, although this rule is different in the case of men, for example former CM of Jammu and Kashmir Omar now Dulla's sister to marry outside person Sarah Abdullah, the state went to be deprived of property rights while Omar Abdullah's marriage was the girl out of the state, but their children have all the rights of the state
 yachika main is tarah ke bhedbhaavpurn niyam ko khatm karne puure desh main ek jaise kanoon ko lagu karne kii maang kii gai thi
 Now, amidst speculation about abolishing 35-A, the demand for one-nation-one law is again intensifying
 hindi jagat ke mahamanch 'agenda ajtak' ke chathe sanskaran ke duusare din shaam ko ‘achche din aa gaye’ seshan main vitt mantri arun jetali ne sawaalon ke jawaab die
 During this, he targeted the Congress fiercely
 jetali ne kaha ki congress ab apni vichaardhaara bhuulakar duusare dalon kii nakal karne kaa prayaas karti dikh rahi he
 He even said that the Congress has mortgaged its ideology to the casteists

 My complaint is with the national party which has pledged its entire ideological personality to these ethnic people
 (agenda ajtak kii phul kawarej ke liye yahaan clic karen)jetali ne sawaal kiya ki kya congress apni vaicharik aadhaar par ye chunaav lard rahi he? unhone kaha kicongress bijepi kii nakalakarnaa chaah rahi he

 is chunaav main congress kaa apana koi cheharaa hi nahin dikh rahaa he

 kehete hai tufaan ko kai roak nahin paata

 tennis kii duniya main novak jokovich tufaan hi sabit hue hai
 Giants like Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer are seen ripping apart in front of him
 vah kamyaabi kaa nayaa itihaas bana rahe hai
 When Andy Murray held Novak Djokovic in the first set of the final match played at the Rod Laver Arena of the Australian Open, there was a doubt in my mind whether Murray would make history here
 mare ne jis tarah se semifinal main federr ko haraaya tha use dekhte hue is ashanka ke sach hone kii sambhaavna bhi thi
 However, Novak Djokovic knew that if this match is prolonged, then only he has the benefit
 endi mare ne duusare set main joardaar sangharsh dikhaaya
 He was then exhausted and could not hold Djokovic's storm in the third and fourth sets
 teen ghante or 40 minute ke khel ke baad jokovich nayaa itihaas bana chuke the
 He has become the first tennis player to win the Australian Open three times in a row
 haalanki is baar unhen nadal or federr ke saamne nahin aana padaa lekin isse unki kamyaabi kaa str kam nahin ho jaataa
 He showed his first threat to Djokovic today, winning the Australian Open at the age of 20 in 2008
 tab unhone semifinal main roger federr ko haraaya tha
 In these five years, he has won only five Grand Slams after this
 kul chah grand slam main jokovich ne chaar baar australian open jeeta he or ek−ek baar vibanladan or america open kaa khitaab unke naam rahaa he
 This suggests that they have to constantly struggle in front of Nadal and Djokovic
 or jokovich yah sangharsh khub kar rahe hai
 He won three Grand Slam titles in 2011 and just one Grand Slam in 2012
 do grand slam main unhen final main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In such a situation, Djokovic has started in 2013
 25 saal ke jokovich ke paas federr or nadal ke mukaable kahin zyada teji he or fitness bhi
 Therefore, the graph of their success has to move forward in the coming time
 aaj tennis kii duniya main dhamal machaane vaale jokovich kaa iraadaa ek samay footbal khilaadi banane kaa tha
 Apart from football, there was also a lot of attachment to skiing
 pita footballar the jo baad main skiir ban gaye
 Later he started running a restaurant
 ghar main kabhi kisi ne tennis nahin khelaa tha lekin jokovich kii kismat kuch aisi rahi ki unke ghar ke samaane hi teen−teen tennis court ban gaye

 Djokovic was just six years old then
 unke aathven saal tak pahunchate pahuche jenic ko kahana pad gaya ki monica seles ke baad itnaa bada tennis tallent maine nahin dekha or vaaki main jokovich ne peeche mudakar nahin dekha
 The comments rafoyal nadal or roger federer ke bich main unhone na keval apni pukhta jagah banaai balki number van khiladi bhi ban gaye
 Djokovic is a more aggressive player than both Federer and Nadal
 besaline par unke jaisaa akramak khilaadi philhal yuva peedi main najar nahin aa rahaa
 His ground strokes played on both sides give rise to bluster
 unke bacand shats kaa jawaab talashna bhi khaasaa mushkil he
 Especially when he plays backhand shots with both his hands, the direction of the ball changes and the player in front is shocked
 andre aagaasi ne unke is shats kaa nayaa naam hi de diya he− mani shats
 According to Agassi, points can always be won by these shots
 endi mare ke khilaaf australian open final main aagaasi ne jokovich ke hi jeetne kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi
 Djokovic lived up to their trust
 jokovich is saal beete saal kii bharpai bhi karnaa chahenge
 Although Nadal is about to return in February, Federer is not even taking his name and Murray is also doing well
 lekin in sab main jokovich sabase aage najar aa rahe hai
 In the coming days, there will be no reduction in their speed
 australian open ke rod lever erina main khele gaye final mukaable ke pehle set main endi mare ne jab novak jokovich ko tham liya to mere man main ek ashanka uthi ki kya mare yahaan itihaas bana denge
 Given the way Murray defeated Federer in the semi-finals, this apprehension was also likely to come true
 lekin, novak jokovich ko maaloom tha ki agar yah muqabla lanbaa khinchaa to phayda unako hi hona he
 Andy Murray showed vigorous struggle in the second set
 uske baad unpar thakaan baari hone lagi or tisare or chauthe set main vah jokovich ke tufaan ko nahin tham paae
 Djokovic had made new history after three hours and 40 minutes of play
 vah lagaataar teen baar australian open jeetne vaale pehle tennis khilaadi ban gaye hai
 Although this time he did not have to come before Nadal and Federer, but this does not reduce his success
 jokovich aaj jahaan pahunche hai uski pehali dhamak unhone 2008 main mahaj 20 saal kii umr main australian open jitkar dikhaai thi
 He then defeated Roger Federer in the semi-finals
 in paanch saalon main vah iske baad mahaj paanch grand slam hi jeet paae hai
 Djokovic has won the Australian Open four times in a total of six Grand Slams and has won the Wimbledon and US Open titles once
 yah bataata he ki nadal or jokovich ke saamne unhen lagaataar sangharsh karnaa pad rahaa he
 And Djokovic is doing this struggle a lot
 2011 main unhone teen grand slam khitaab jite to 2012 main mahaj ek grand slam
 In the two Grand Slams, they lost in the final
 aise main 2013 main jokovich ne shuruyaat to shandaar kii he

 1
 choti umr se hi lakshya prapti main lag janaa
 
 
 Indira may have been the granddaughter of the then famous barrister Moti Lal Nehru and the daughter of popular Congress leader Jawaharlal Nehru, but she formed a monkey army at an early age to take on the British
 vah iske madhyam se jhanda juluus, virodh pradarshan ke saath-saath congressi netaaon ke samvedansheen prakashnon or pratibandhit samagriyon kaa parisancharan karne kaa kaam karti thim

 Those who know Indira believe that Indira was always preparing herself for bigger roles
 unhone shanti niketan ke saath-saath oxford or somaraville college main padhai kii
 However, she continued to work there as a member of the Indian League struggling for India's independence

 Durga was sometimes dumb and later Durga
 
 
 jawahar laal nehru kii maut ke baad laal bahadur shastri desh ke pradhan mantri bane
 After her accidental death, Indira took over the reins of the country

 4
 desh ko rakhaa hameshaa aage
 
 
 Indira always remembers Indira as a leader for whom the country is first
 haalanki is kram main un par kai aarope bhi lagate hai ki unhonesatta kaa durupyogkia
 Malpractised in the elections, but the country will always be thankful for decisions like nationalization of banks, privy purse
 5
 Always ahead in decision making
 
 
 raajnneetik visheshgy maanate hai ki vah gajab kii rajaneta thim
 Be it the decision to impose emergency in the country or the attacks on separatists in Punjab

 This makes the game more interesting
 ' However, the idea of former Australian batsman Michael Bevan differs on the issue

 madhya pradeshvidhansabhachunaav ke siyaasi ran main satta vaapasi kaa puraa jor laga rahi congress ke iraadon ko unke apane netaa hi kamjor kar rahe hai
 In the last 24 hours, two Congress leaders have made the Congress angry with their statements and have given the BJP a chance to make fun of the Congress
 maamla indore kirau vidhansabhaka he
 Here a video of Jitu Patwari, MLA and working president of Madhya Pradesh Congress is going viral, in which he is seen saying, 'you take care of me, you have to respect me party should take oil' Actually, Jitu Patwari will meet the people of his constituency on Monday Arrived
 yahaan patawaari ne apane vidhansabha main logon se mulaakaat kar vot dene kii apil kar rahe the, lekin is dauraan unki jubaan phisal gai or unhone logon se kah diya ki 'aap meraa dhyaan rakhana, aapako meri izzat rakhni he party jaae tel lene'
 # watchcongress MLA from Indore's Rau, Jitu Patwari during door-to-door campaigning in Indore, says, "aapko meri izzat rakhni hai, Party gayi tel lene

 com / ziodfldwey— ANI (@ani)october 23, 2018ye video khud jitu dwaara hi fasebuk par post kiya gaya tha, lekin video viral hote hi unhone ise apane fasebuk pej se hataa liya lekin ab video soshal media par viral ho rahaa he
 As soon as the video went viral, BJP got another chance to attack the Congress and it did not delay in reacting to it
 bijepi netaa kailash vijayawargeey ne tanj kasate hue kaha ki ''abhi tak lagata tha kamalnath kii congress he, sindhiya kii congress he, digvijay kii congress he
 Today, Jeetu Patwari also has a Congress
 "haalanki, congress ne jitu patawaari kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki unhone bijepi ke liye un shabdon kaa istemaal kiya tha naa ki congress ke liye
 Congress spokesperson Shobha Ojha said, "the person who is seen in the video talking to Jitu Patwari is the home of a BJP supporter and hence Jitu was using those words for his party i
e
 BJP and not Congress
" ''jitu patawaari hi nahi, congress kii purv vidhayak kalpana parulekar ne congress daftar main pahunchakar mahidpur vidhansabha se naa keval daavedaari thoki balki purv mukhyamantridigvijay sinhaper hamalaa karte hue unhen congress kii sthiti ke liye zimmedaar bataaya
 During this time, a video of him also became viral
 congress pravaktaa unhen baat karne se rokte hue ek alag kamare main le gayin lekin kamare se baahar nikalate hi kalpana parulekar phir bifer padin or unhone digvijay singh par jamkar waar kiye
 Parulekar said that the entire Madhya Pradesh knows that speaking of Digvijay only leads to division
 congress ne kalpana ke video ko gambhir mana he or isaki shikaayat alaakaman ko karne kii baat kahi he
 The Congress gives the slogan "time is for change" but it does not seem that the Congress leader is ready to change because such statements do not appear to benefit the Congress in any way
 sansad kaa sheetakaaleen satr khatm hone ko aayaa or na to vah jiesti vidheyak paarit hua jiske itane kaside kaadhe gaye the or na hi koi doosraa kanoon ban sakaa
 Among the laws that have been stalled include the law to prevent corruption
 duusari taraf, sattarudh bijepi or vipaksh ke bich siyaasi garmagarmee is kadar bad gai he ki shuruaati dinon ke bhaichaare ko puri tarah bhula diya gaya
 Congress leaders have already raised their heads after the order to show Sonia and Rahul Gandhi in court in the National Herald case
 herald maamle ko lekar bijepi or congress ke bich paidaa hua takaraav khatm bhi nahin hua tha ki dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke kareebi sahaayak or pramukh sachiv rajendra kumaar ke khilaaf sibiai jaanch ko lekar bijepi or aam aadmi party ke bich ghamaasan chhid gaya
 It seems that the case against Kumar is so big and serious that even CBI did not follow the protocol
 protocol yah he ki jis shaks ke khilaaf chaape maare ja rahe hai, thik uske upar ke adhikari ko yah jaankaree deni hoti he
 He was the chief minister in this case
 aisa karne kii bajaae sibiai kii timen 16 disambar ko subah 9 baje dilli sachivalay par aa dhamkeen or sidhe kumaar ke daftar ko sil kar diya
 According to the CBI, a large number of cash has come out in the raids so far, among other things
 sibiai ke mutabik kumaar ke khilaaf bhrashtachar kaa pukhta maamla banataa he
 Fueled by anger, according to Kejriwal, the Prime Minister is "cowardly and psychopathic" and alleges that the CBI received the raid decree directly from Modi
 itnaa hi nahin, unhone yah bhi kaha ki dilli jila cricket association ko chalaane main vitt mantri arun jetali ne jamkar dhaandhlee kii he
 CBI came to see the files of this scam
 ye filein daftar se gaayab hai or mukhyamantri maamle kii jaanch karne ke liye ayog baitaane kaa man bana rahe hai
 According to some reports, the Chief Minister of Delhi has no right to conduct any such inquiry
 arun jetali ke mutabik ye aarope bakawaas hai or sibiai apana kaam karne ke liye puri tarah aaazaad he
 According to Yogendra Yadav, once a close aide of Kejriwal, "both the allegations are true
" ” ve kehete hai, “bijepi badale kii karrwai kii doshi he or aap kii sarkaar tamaasha karne kii
 Can they please pay attention to the government by sparing the people? ” There is no shame left in this constantly sharp political quarrel
 bihar main mili shikast ke baad pradhanmantri sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr ke shuruaati dinon main vipaksh kii taraf dosti kaa haath badhaate hue dikh rahe the
 Even during the debate in Parliament on intolerance, he and his party leaders listened silently to the opposition's clashes
 lekin dhire-dhire vah mulammaa utarane laga, khaskar us vakt jab congress ne jiesti par sarkaar ke prastaavon kaa jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya or asal main neshnal herald maamle main apni mukhaalafat ko or oonchai par pahunchaa diya
 Now, along with the CBI raids on the office of Kejriwal's close aide, the general perception among political sections is that the BJP has achieved so much success that it has also united those factions of the opposition which do not eye each other in every respect Can be mixed
 misaal ke taur par pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne kejariwal ke is daawey kaa samarthan kiya ki kumaar ke khilaaf chhaapon ke peeche bijepi hi thi
 In the state assembly elections to be held in the middle of 2016, Mamta's main contest is against BJP
 nitish kumaar ke janata dal (united) ne bhi is baat kaa samarthan kiya ki kejariwal hi nishaanaa the
 aap's staunch enemy Congress party also criticized the bjp's decision to raid Kumar during the Parliament session
 chhaapon kaa samay siyaasi lihaaj se vaaki bahut anukool nahin kaha ja saktaa, isiilie lutian kii dilli main yah mudda khaasaa garmaya hua he
 It is not that questions about Kumar are not arising
 lagata he, 2013 kii shuruyaat main kejariwal kii 49 din kii sarkaar ke samay ek vidhayak ne kai logon kii maujuudagi main unase kaha tha ki kumaar ko apana pramukh sachiv banane kaa unka faisla bheeshan galati he
 The MLA also cited the so-called "evidence of corruption" during Kumar's tenure in the Department of Education and IT
 lekin kejariwal ne aaropon ko khaarij kar diya
 An old colleague of Kejriwal remembers his attitude of creating a huge spectacle at the cost of royalty
 ye sahyogi maanate hai ki kejariwal ke paas dilli sareekhe bade or pechida shahar kii hukumat ke liye jaruri anushaasan yaa usulon se bandhaa dimag nahin he
 This is the reason that when an illegal slum in Delhi was cleaned by the Railways and a girl was killed in it, Kejriwal broke down accusing her of gross negligence
 jab tak ki yah bilkul saaf nahin ho gaya ki vah bacchee safai abhiyaan shuru hone se pehle hi mar chuki thi
 Similarly, there was no point in Kejriwal's criticism against any criticism of Tomar in the case of AAP MLA Jitendra Tomar and his "fake degrees", but ultimately he felt that his former partner was wrong
 kejariwal ke aalochak yah bhi maanate hai ki dilli ke mukhyamantri 2019 main hone vaale aam chunaav tak kisi na kisi tarah apane ko chakachaundh main banaae rakhenge, in chunaavon main ve apane ko modi ke mukhya mukaable main khadaa karnaa chaahate hai
 These critics also say that Kejriwal is not particularly happy that Nitish Kumar has evicted him from this position by upholding his status in Bihar
 kejariwal ke himachati jor dekar kehete hai ki pradhanmantri dilli ke mukhyamantri ko tabhi se naapnsad karte hai, jab 2014 main vah ahmedabad pahunch gaye the
 He had laid siege to the road leading to the office of the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi and troubled him by questioning his unequal development in the state
 may 2014 ke varanasi ke chunaav main us tanaav kii tasdik hui or 2015 kii shuruyaat main dilli ke chunaavon main bhi vah jari rahaa, jisamen modi or kejariwal ke bich sidhaa muqabla hua tha
 Politicians say that the CBI raids are just the new hallmark of modi-kejriwal's old war
 jahaan tak modi kii baat he, bahuterey log maanate hai (or aap netaa ashutosh ne kaha ki siyaayat main mahatv isi baat kaa he ki log kya maanate hai) ki chaape kii karrwai ko anjaam dene se pehle modi kii ijaajat maangi gai thi
 With this, the tension between BJP and opposition has suddenly become very sharp
 sansad ke monsoon satr kii tarah sheetakaaleen satr bhi bagaiyr koi vidheyak paarit kiye khatm ho jayega
 This bitterness is likely to become even more fierce and sharp during the election campaigns of the state assemblies of West Bengal, Assam and Tamil Nadu in 2016, and again in the Punjab and Uttar Pradesh campaigns in 2017
 sharafat kii jabaan pehle hi kuch samay se siyasat kii bhent chadh chuki he, lekin rajendra kumaar par chhaapon ne use ek nai gart main pahunchaa diya he
 While Kejriwal described the Prime Minister as "psychopathic", Arun Jaitley insisted that he would not fall so low as to say something on "nonsense", to which Kejriwal again said that he was "lying"
 vahiin kerala main modi ne ek raily main kaha ki congress dhwans, todfod or vinaash ke raste par chal rahi he, isliye sansad ko thap kar rahi he
 When politics is so bitterly divided, then there is more possibility of Parliament to remain an arena of fighting
 siyaasi panditon ko hairat he ki aise main kahin sarkaar kiafiyat, samajhaaish, maan-manouvval or sarvanumati kii bajaae hukmanaamon or adhyadeshon ke dam par hukumat karne ko majaboor na ho jaae
 Kumar may have to be, but the fact is that his case has exposed deep cracks in the ability of the political community to talk to each other
 vivaad kaa centre binduyah shaks arvind kejariwal or centre sarkaar ke bich vivaad kii vajah banaarajendra kumarajanm kii taarikh16 disambar, 1966agmauti kader ke 1989 batch ke iees adhikariiity dilli ke electrical ejineering ke purv chaatrafarvari 2015 main unhen dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kaa pramukh sachiv niyukt kiya gayakumar ne 2014 main mukhyamantri ke taur par kejariwal ke pehle kaarykaal main bhi unke sachiv ke rup main kaam kiya thashila dikshit ke unki pichhali tainatiyon main dilli traansco limited ke adhyaksh-sah-prabandh nideshak, dilli yatayaat praadhikaran ke sachiv-sah-ayukta, sachiv (swasthya), ayukta (vyapaar or kar) shaamil hai
 Gaya Kumar, who was awarded the Prime Minister's Award for Excellence in Public Administration in 2007, has been considered close to Kejriwal's anti-corruption campaign since the days that he formed companies and got them government contracts without tenders

 viechpi adhyaksh praveen togdipha ne ajtak channel ke sidhi baat kaarykram main hedlins today ke managing editor rahul kanwal se baatcheet kii
 Excerpts from the conversation
 dow
 Togadia has filed an FIR against you, there is talk of arresting you
 bhokar main jo sabha hui usamen maine hinduon ke rojgaar, shiksha, swasthya, suraksha or ram mandir jaise muddon kii maang kii
 With this i described some incidents in India
 police ne mere bhaashan ke baad meri casette dekhi, cese nahin banataa tha, parantu vah purv mukhyamantri ashok chavaan kaa nirvachan kshetra he
 The Hindus of the country should not demand their rights and this was done to suppress the voice of the Hindus
 aaj tak togdipha bolta tha par ab karodon hindu bolenge
 You compared people in the Muslim community to animals
 kya yah thik he?maine kisi kaa naam nahin liya or bina naam liye baat kii he
 Now Dr
 togdipha kii aawaaj nahin rukegi or na hi hinduon ke adhikaron ko dabaaya jayega
 But you mentioned many riots there and said that we shed dead bodies there
 itihaas kii ghatana kaa varnan karnaa kya paap he? hamane yah nahin kaha ki laashen bahaai hai, hamane kaha itihaas main hua he
 But what is the difference between you and Owaisi? i have talked about the demand of 100 crore Hindus
 kyon is desh main hindu ko apamaanit kiya jaataa he? musalamaanon ke bacchon ko shiksha di jaati he, uttar pradesh main musalamaanon kii betiyon ko 30,000 ru
 But nothing to the daughter of a Hindu, mullah-maulvis in Bengal got Rs 2,500
 par hindu ko kuch nahin, kisaan ko kuch nahin
 You can raise the demand of the people but you provoke the people? i have spoken about the aspiration of Hindus, which 50,000 people came to listen to
 dharm sansad main narendra modi kaa naam lene par sadhu-santon ne jabardast taaliyaan bajaain?aaj se lekar purv ke 30-40 saal tak vishwa hindu parishad ne kisi vyakti yaa kisi dal ko vot dene kii baat nahin kii or na hi kisi dal ke samarthan main koi prastaav paarit kiya
 But this time Modi is talking? There is a bigger side than a person, a bigger idea than a side
 vishwa hindu parishad kahati he ki jo vyakti sansad main kanoon banaakar ram mandir banavaayega, jo kahegaa ki vah hindu raashtra main shraddha rakhata he, jo dhara 370 ko hatvaayega, jo samaan naagarik samhita main bharosa rakhega, usko hindu samaaj vot de
 Why avoid Modi so much? i love 100 crore Hindus, all Hindus come to that
 mujhe kisi hindu se dwesh nahin he
 There is competition between you and Modi as to who should be the face of Hindutva? Do you know what is the internal synergy of both of us and maybe the face of Modi's face is the face of the Togadia of Hindu nation
 to kya modi ke peeche dow
 Togadia has a face? Togadia is the person who believes in Hindu nation
 modi ahmedabad se dilli aana chaahate hai, isliye ve hindutv ke raste se hatakar koi bich kaa rasta pakadia chaahate hai?dilli kaa har rasta ayodhya se gujarata he

 We Indians generally understand that people of developed countries, especially America, will be very intelligent and they will know more than us in every field

 4 million) america naagarikkon ko ye tak nahin pataa he ki chocolate banane ke liye doodh kahaan se or kaise aata he
 In a survey conducted by the US Dairy's Innovation Center, about 16 million Americans said that brown cow gives brown milk, which is probably chocolate

 This queen of Ranthambore had played a very important role in settling Ranthambore and Sariska
 aaj ranthambhore kii yah maharani is duniya ko alavida kah gai
 The death of this Tiger Quinn is a deep loss for Ranthambore
 'machhlee' kaa putala banaakar mujium main rakhane kii maangais baghin kii prasiddhi ko lekar vanyajeev premiyon ne baghin kii smriti main iskaa putala banaakar rajeev gandhi mujium main lagaanen sahit isaki samadhi banaanen kii maang kii he
