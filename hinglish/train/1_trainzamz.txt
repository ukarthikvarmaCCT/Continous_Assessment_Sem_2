 They were called untouchables and untouchables
 is asprishyata ko todane kii ummid main gandhi ji ne unhen ek naam diya tha - kaha tha ki ve ishwar kii santan hai
 He hoped that perhaps this would break the sense of untouchability, but Ambedkar's realization proved more authentic than Gandhi's goodwill at this point
 ambedkar ne kaha ki aise naam parivartan se kaam nahin chalegaa
 This name will also be gradually associated with the same untouchability

 The government also banned the term
 lekin tab tak anusuchit janajatiyon kii raajnneeti kaaphi aage bad chuki thi
 He had rejected Gandhi's name

 The fight lasted simultaneously on several fronts

 Sharan Kumar Limbale's autobiography 'akkarmashi' came out in Marathi, so there was a panic
 marathi main puraa ek raajnneetik-saahitiyik andolan chal padaa
 Namdev Dhasal, Laxman Gaikwad, Baby Kamble, Daya Pawar and many such writers came out, which today have an all India acceptance
 duusari bhashaaon main bhi yah prakriya chali
 The literature of these communities has also continued to prosper in Hindi
 om prakaash valmiki, mohandas nemishray, tulsi ram, shyoraj singh baichaiyn, suraj singh paliwal, sushila thakabhonre, rajani tilak or anita bharti jaise kai lekhakon ne samaaj ke us sach ko saamne rakhaa, jo ab tak baaki logon ke liye anjaanaa bana hua tha
 Not only this, he also questioned the mainstream sentiments and criticism
 dharmaveer jaise aalochak ne premchand ko kathghare main laa khadaa kiya or kabir ke tamaam aalochakon par ek ke baad ek hamale kiye
 Apart from literature and ideas, politics interfered heavily in this discourse
 ambedkar kii vaicharik-saidhantik raajnneeti ko kanshiram ne bilkul vyaavhaarik rup diya or desh ke sabase bade soobe uttar pradesh ne in samudaayon kii pehali sarkaar dekhi
 As of today, this political stream is giving the most intense and fierce challenge to the politics of the NDA Government and BJP at the Center

 ek samudaay se uski vah pahchaan chin lenaa choti baat nahin he, jisane uske bheetar apane daman kaa ehsaas bhi paidaa kiya or usase ladane kii samuhik taaqat bhi di

 hollywood film Thor yaa Avengers to aapane jarur dekhi hogi, jisamen hero ke paas ek aisa hathaudaa hota he jise uske alaava koi nahin uthaa saktaa
 There is a scene in Avengers 2 where all the super heroes try to lift that hammer but fail
 ant main use Thor yani hollywood star kris hemsworth hi uthaa pate hai
 One such hammer has been made by electrical engineer Allen Paulne who only rises from them
 unhone iskaa video bhi post kiya he, jisamen unke banaae hathode ko log uthaane kii koshish to khub karte hai lekin uthaa nahin pate
 Later Paul picks him up comfortably and people are quite surprised to see this
 kaise banaaya hathaudadarasal ailen paul ne hathode jaisaa ek electromagnet banaaya he jiske handle parafingerprinttch sensor laga diya he
 As he grabs the handle of the hammer, the electromagnet goes off and he picks up the hammer easily
 electromagnet of hote hi magnet kaam karna shuru kar detaa he or matelic farsh par chipak jaataa he
 However, this hammer only works on the metallic surface because if it is placed on the second floor, its magnets will not work and then anyone can lift it
 baharhaal ailen paul ne is hathode ko banane ke liye kaaphi mehnat kii he or powerful magnet banaaya he, jise aam log uthaane main naakaam ho rahe hai
 See in the video how people are failing to lift their hammer afghanistan main america nit balon ne nangarhaar praant main lashkar e taiyaba ke aatankwaadiyon kii bharmaar dekhi he

 fifa world cap ke 21wein sanskaran ke pehle pre-quarter final mukaablen main aaj do baar kii vijeta argentina kaa saamana france se hoga
 The start of the actual World Cup will truly begin with the last-16 tour where every team will get a chance to fulfill their dream of winning the World Cup in every round
 agar haar mili to sapana tuutegaa or agar jeet mili to trophy kii taraf ek kadam badhegaa
 Both Argentina and France were considered title contenders before the start of the World Cup
 ab jabaki yah donon timen nokout main bhid raheen hai to ek baat tay he ki ek team is res se baahar ho jaaegi
 Argentina, however, has not performed as expected
 group daur main uske pradarshan ne kai logon ko maayusi di, lekin team ne jarurat ke samay apane aap ko sambhala or agle daur main jagah banaai
 He will have to improve his performance against France
 vah jis tarah kaa khel khelti ai he agar vahi khelti rahi to france ke liye quarter final kaa rasta khulaa hoga
 The problem for the Argentine team is that it is relying on its captain Lionel Messi
 vah jab bhi fansati he ummid karti he ke mesi apana karishma dikhaaen
 FIFA World Cup: Knockout match from yesterday, know the schedule of last-16 Argentina should have won in the final match of the group round against Nigeria and Messi encouraged his team by scoring the first goal of the match although Marcus Rojo won for Argentina Had scored france ke liye bhi yah match kisi bhi lihaaj se aasaan nahin hone vaala he, kyonki group daur main use koi kadaa pratidwandvi nahin mila
 Now that a strong team like Argentina and a great striker like Messi is in front of him, he has to be very cautious
 france ne is world cap main ek gol khaaya he or teen gol kiye hai
 They are the only team to play goalless draws in this World Cup
 usne group daure ke apane aakhri match main denmark ke saath drow khelaa tha
 The French defense will have to undergo a rigorous test in this match, for which team coach Didir Deschamps must have prepared
 vah mesi ke khilaaf kis ranneeti se utarate hai wo dekhnaa hoga
 France's hopes will rest on Antoine Griezmann, Paul Pogba and Umatiti
 yah teenon khilaadi aise hai jo argentina ke khel ko jaanate bhi hai or use takkar dene kaa madda bhi rakhte hai
 Who is the 'greatest' in Messi and Ronaldo? Today there will be 2 matches and pictures: Argentina: - Goalkeepers: Wilfredo Caballero, Franco Amarni, Nahuel guzmandefender: Gabrielle Macedre, Javier Mascherano, Nichols Otamendi, Federico Fazio, Marcos Rojo, Nicolaes Tagliafico, Christiana Lucaldiucal, Marcia Annalcadillo Salvio, Eve Banega, Angel di Maria, Enzo Perez, Giovanni Lo Celso, Maximiliano Meja Forward: Lionel Messi, Sergio Aguero, Gonzalo Higuain and Paulo debalafrance: - Goalkeeper: Loris, Steve Mandanda, Alphonse Aeroladiffender: Lucas Hernandez, Pressnell Kimpembe, Benjamin Mendy, Benjamin Powered, Adil Rami, Jibril Simdemol, Samuel Rangan Kante, Bless Matuidi, Steven Anonji, Paul Pogba, Corentin Tolisoforward: Ousmane Dembele, Nabil Fakir, Olivier Ziru, Antoine Griezmann, Thomas Lemar, Kylian Embape, kejariwal ne kaha ki aazaadee ke baad pehali baar aisa hua hoga jab kisi state kii ruling party kaa offis state main nahin ho
 The Congress has four offices and a plot in Delhi, while the BJP has 7 offices and a plot in Delhi

 ' bharat or austrailia ke bich somvaar se shuru hone vaali chaar test maichon kii shrinkhalaa main balle or gend ke alaava maansik majbootee kii kadi pariksha hogi jisamen bhartiya team ke paas austrailian sarajameen par 64 saal main pehali baar shrinkhalaa jeetne kaa sunaharaa avasar hoga
 The Australian team has been battling continuously for some time and in such a situation, it is considered an excellent opportunity for the Indian team to end the long wait of not winning the series here
 austrailia kii team yuva or anubhavheen he or maaikel clark swayan sweekaar kar chuke hai unke yuva gendbaajon ko bharat kii anbhavi ballebaajon ke saamne kadi pariksha se guzarana hoga lekin mahendra singh dhoni kii team ke liye muqabla kisi bhi kone se aasaan nahin hoga
 Indian records may be steadily improving, but they will have to deal with the harsh conditions in Australia for which this country is known
 bharat anubhav ke dam par is baar austrailia se aage dikh rahaa he lekin lambey chaude maidan or oochaal leti pichen bhartiya team kii kadi pariksha lengi
 Australia has been going through a bad phase for some time and therefore it is considered as the best opportunity for India
 aise main yadi sachin tendulkar 100waan antarrashtriya shatak bhi puraa kar lete hai to ise sone par suhaaga hi kaha jayega
 In fact, his century is being awaited in such a way that if he achieves this feat in the first Test itself, then it will be overshadowed by the result
 ab tak 184 test maichon main 15,183 ran banane vaale tendulkar pichley saat test kii 13 pariyon or chaar ekadivasiy maichon se apane mahashatak kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 Even now his teammates are urging him to end this wait
 duusari taraf riki ponting hai jinhone 158 test match main 12,656 ran banaaye hai or don breadman ke baad austrailia ke sarvshereshth ballebaaj hai lekin vah pichley do saal se shatak nahin laga paye hai
 He has been a target of critics for not scoring a century in the last 16 Tests and 30 innings
 ponting is shrinkhalaa main unhen karaara jawaab dene kii koshish karenge
 This series is very important for India as it has never been able to win nine of the nine series it has played in Australia in 64 years
 yahi nahin bhartiya ballebaaj ke teen dhurandharon tendulkar, rahul dravid (160 test main 13,094 ran) or vivies lakshmana (130 test main 8,626 ran) ke paas yah nishchit taur par austrailia main itihaas rachane kaa aakhri mauka hoga kyonki bharat ko austrailia kaa aglaa dauraan 2014 main karnaa he
 It is considered easy for India on paper as Australia have inexperienced attacks in the form of James Pattinson (two Tests), Peter Siddle (27 Tests), Ben Hilfenhaus (17 Tests) and Nathan Lyon (seven Tests)
 The way they have performed recently as an individual and bowling group could make them Australia's most powerful weapon in the upcoming series
 austrailia ko bharosa he ki unka akraman ballebaajon kii asafalataa kii bharpaayi karegaa kyonki pichley do saal main 21 test maichon main alag alag pariyon main uski team 136, 47, 192, 88 or 127 ran ke chote score par dher hui he
 Australia's biggest worry is the absence of their most experienced batsmen Ponting and Michael Hussey
 use bhale hi ummid he ki aid kowan or david warner kii nayi salaami jodi uski opening kii pareshaani ko khatm karne main safal rahegi
 Actually, Australia are worried about their batting
 swing uski kamajori bani hui he or aise main jahir khan, ishanth sharma or umesh yadav unke ballebaajon ko tharra sakate hai
 It is a different matter that Zaheer and Ishant have been suffering from ankle injury recently and their fitness is a matter of concern for the team but both have given good signs on the nets
 ishanth ne to apane puure damakham se gendbaaji kii jabaki jahir bhi pehle test match main khilne ke liye betaab hai
 In 2008, Ishant caught the attention of people by making Ponting a constant victim
 vah ab tak chah baar ponting ko out kar chuke hai
 Although Zaheer has never been able to complete the tour of Australia so far and has scored at an average of around 40 runs, he is desperate to make up for it
 melbern cricket ground kii pich se tej gendbaajon ko madad milane kii ummid he tathaa isamen pehle 30 over ahm honge
 In such a situation, the role of Gambhir and Sehwag becomes extremely important

 Has scored 833 runs at an impressive average of 50

 There is a possibility of cloudy skies and light drizzle on the first day of the match and in such a situation both captains would consider it appropriate to field first
 team is prakaar hai-bharat:mahendra singh dhoni (captain), virendra sahvaag, gautam gambhir, rahul dravid, sachin tendulkar, vivies lakshmana, viraat kohli, ravichandran aswin, jahir khan, ishanth sharma, umesh yadav, rohit sharma, abhimanyu mithun, pragyan ojha, riddhimaan saaha or ajinkya rahane

 When the whole world sleeps, the streets here are buzzing
 yahaan zyaadaatar mujrevaaliyon ke ghar gulabi yaa jamuni rang ke hai
 As shown in the films, some of the same lines are also seen in large halls here
 haul kii chatakile rangon vaali deevaaron par bade-bade aaine lage hote hai, falls ceiling par khubasurat jhumar latak rahe hote hai
 Those who see Mujra are called 'guests' here
 mehmaannawaaji bhi puure adab se hoti he
 Here the atmosphere and tradition of Mujre has not changed at all
 lekin is parampara ko jinda rakhane vaala deredaar samaaj jarur samay ke saath khud ko badal rahaa he yaa yun kahen ki badalane ko majaboor he
 The Daredar society has preserved the tradition of Mujre for the last four and a half years
 lekin jaisaa ki deredaar samaaj ke adhyaksh amin ahamed bataate hai, ‘ab 60 pariwaron main se sirf 24 gharaanon main hi mujra hota he
 The remaining 36 houses have broken away from this profession by calling themselves 'sharif Ghar'
 chunki mujrevaaliyon ke ghar mehmaanon ke liye hameshaa khule rahete hai, isiilie 'sharif gharavaalon' ne apane gharon ke baahar takhtiyaan laga di hai, jin par likhaa hota he, ‘bina ijaajat andar aana manaa he
 'this is the difference between Mujrewale gharanas and Sharif gharanas
 jin gharaanon main ab bhi mujra badastoor jari he, ve bhi apni nai peedi ko isse juda rakhana chaahate hai
 32-year-old Firdaus aka Shaheen, also known as Guddi, has been performing Mujra for the last almost two decades
 apane kaam se prem karne vaali guddi ke liye kamai kaa ekmaatr jariya bhi yahi he
 That is why she does not want to leave this profession, but wants to keep her seven-year-old son away from this world
 guddi kahati he, ‘mujra beshak ek kala he, lekin tawaayphon ke prati samaaj kaa najariya kabhi bahut acha nahin rahaa
 i want my son to study and get away from this world
 ’ isi nazariye ke kaaran das baras pehle tak jahaan muhalle ke lagbhag 20 gharon main rojaanaa mujra hua karata tha, vahiin aaj hafte main teen din bhi mujre kii mehfil jam jaae to bahut he
 The history of Mujre in Burhanpur is as old as Mughal history
 solahavin sadi main shahanshah akbar ne farukhi badshaah bahadurshah ko haraakar burhanpur par kabja jamaaya tha
 Akbar sent his son Murad Shah here to take power
 vah apane laavo-lashkar ke saath manoranjan ke liye tawaayphon ko bhi unke deron samet laayaa tha
 In 1606, for the first time in Burhanpur, the sound of tabla was echoed with the sound of tabla
 jahangir ke putr shahjada parvej ke swaagat main 1606 main hi akabari sarai main bhavy jalsa hua, jisamen aam janata ne pehali baar mujra dekha
 The event became the first page of the history of the Mujars in Burhanpur
 1616 main jahangir ne hi in derevaalon ko borwari kshetra main basaaya tha
 At that time, Jahangir was also fascinated on the tavern like Motikunwar, Begum Gulara
 usne moti kunwar ke liye aseergarh ke paas mahal banwaaya tha, jise moti mahal kaha jaataa he, to gulaara begum ke liye bhi utaavali nadi ke kinare mahal gulaara banwaaya tha
 King Aurangzeb, who had a staunch image, also loved Hirabai, a Hindu tawaif from Burhanpur
 deredaar samaaj khud ko jahangir or aurangzeb kii preyasiyon or mashhoor tawaayphon gularabano, motikunwar or hirabai kaa vanshaj maanata he
 The era changed rapidly, but the same culture and tradition continued in the Mujars here
 pichley 38 saal se mujaron main hormonium baja rahe nisaar ahamed bataate hai, ‘mujaron par aajkal ke item geeton kaa asar nahin padaa
 Even today people like to see Mujra on the songs of Umrao Jaan
 ’ ek or khaas baat yah he ki yahaan aaj bhi record kiye geeton kii bajaae sangatkaaron ke saath hi baqayada mehfil sajaakar mujre pesh kiye jate hai
 Samina, the young tawaif adopting this profession due to her love for song and music, says, 'mujra has been seen since childhood
 sajnaa-sanvarna, nrity karnaa acha lagata tha
 Wish there was just one chance in Bollywood
 ’ haalanki yahaan kii ek bhi tawayph itani khushkismat nahin rahi, jise yah mauka mila ho
 a bitter truth associated with the lives of tawaifs is that they are unable to name their children as fathers
 tawaayphon kaa nikaah nahin hota he, lekin sarfaraajon kii badaulat vansh chalata he
 a person who promises to spend the life of a tawaif in a ritual of Daredar society and is allowed to do Mujra, is called Sarfaraz
 tawayph kaa sarfaraj kii sampatti par koi haq nahin hota, na uske bacchon ko pita kaa naam miltaa he
 Most people of this society are known by their mother's name
 par mashhoor tawayph fatima ke bete jafar ahamed ne is parampara ko badalakar ek misaal kaayam kii he
 Ahmed, a powerloom businessman Rauf Seth, who was his mother's chief, made him capable of training
 apni maa ko samaaj main sammanjanak sthaan dilaane ke liye ahamed ne sarfaraj kii parampara ko todate hue unka rauf seth se baqayada nikaah padhwaaya
 For some time, awareness has also increased in education in Daredar society
 amin ahamed bataate hai ki samaaj ke kai bachche pard-likhakar apane pairon par khadey ho chuke hai
 People have also made daughters, doctors, teachers and teachers by educating them
 lekin ye log tawayph ke vanshaj ke taur par apni pahchaan jaahir nahin hone dena chaahate
 Perhaps the same stereotypical attitude of the society towards the tawaifs is at its core
 haalanki jo mahilaayein aaj bhi guzar-basar ke liye mujre par hi nirbhar hai, unke jivan ko police ke kade ravaiye ne or bhi kshtdaayak bana diya he
 Gopi Khurana, a long-time councilor from this colony, says, "the administration does not consider Mujre as a crime, but with the objective of maintaining security system, it has kept guard over the Mujars
 mujra dekhne aane waalon ke naam baqayada register main darj hote hai
 Fearful of this, people have reduced their visit here, which has a direct impact on the income of the tawaifs
 ’ 'mukhiya' (66) was shot and killed by someone early in the morning on June 1
 iske baad uske samarthakon ne madhya bihar ke kuch jilon main baari bavaal kaata
 The murder took place in Kaira in Bihar's Bhojpur district when the chief was out for a morning walk
 agyaat bandookdhaariyon ne us par hamalaa bol kareeb 40 golia chalaayin
 Brahmeshwar Singh is believed to be behind the 36 massacres in Bihar in the nineties in which at least 400 people were killed
 inamen 1997 main hua kukhyat lakshmanpur bathe hatyakand bhi he jisamen 63 daliton ko ek saath khadaa kar ke maar diya gaya tha
 The headman was arrested in August 2002 on charges of these massacres and was released on bail the previous year
 in das saal ke dauraan usne chuppi saadhe rakhi thi or maheene bhar pehle hi apni nai ranneeti kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 On May 7, the chief had resolved to organize 'farmers and farm laborers' to launch a non-violent movement to draw the attention of the government to the interests of the farmers
 iske alaava mukhiya ne apni chuppi todate hue bathani tolaa hatyakand ke 23 doshiyon ko bari kiye jane ke faisle ko nitish sarkaar dwaara chunauti dene kaa virodh kiya tha
 21 Dalits were killed in the July 1996 Bathani Tola massacre
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke maddenjar mukhiya kii manshaa is mudde kaa istemaal karke apane kamjor pad chuke aadhaar ko dobaaraa hasil karne kii thi
 Although he denied any political ambitions, there was no doubt that he had a desire to emerge as a center of power
 janata ke kalyaan ke liye samaaj seva karne ke uske hawaii daavon ke bich yah ashanka jataai ja rahi thi ki brahmeshwar ranvir sena ko nae sire se jinda kar ke bihar main apni khoi hui jameen talashne kii kavayad main he
 Whether this murder is the result of his old misdeeds or the recent rise, nothing can be said about this
 lekin nabbe ke dashak main ranvir sena ke naam se behad barbar nijee sena chalaane vaale mukhiya kii hatya bihar ke najuk saamaajik santulan ke lihaaj se gambhir khatra bhi he
 The political mercury of Bihar has suddenly risen due to this incident
 rajd ke pramukh lalu prasad yadav or bhaajapa kii bihar ikai adhyaksh si
 P
 thakur ne is hatya kii sibiai se jaanch karwaane kii maang kar daali he
 Brahmeshwar Singh was first elected head of the Khopira Panchayat of Sandesh Block in Bhojpur district in 1971, since then 'mukhiya' was added to his name
 brahmeshwar ko belur block ke mukhiya shiv narayan choudhary se 1994 main ranvir kisaan sangharsh samiti kii kaman mili thi or aisa hote hi pasa palat gaya
 The reason for Brahmeshwar reaching the pinnacle of supremacy was the relief and protection provided by the armed forces to the landlords, who had become insecure due to the rise of extremist groups in that area
 isi dauraan yadavon ne savarna or vampanthi girohon se ladane ke liye loric sena bana lee thi
 The Kurmis also had a land army, while the Rajput landlords' army was named Sunlight Army
 iske alaava aaazaad sena, shrikrishna sena, kunwar sena or ganga senaayen bhi sakriy thim
 In that era of armies and violence, the chief was not deterred, but the time of peace passed heavily on this old fighter
 teesri seat ke liye congress ke ahamed patel kaa jeetna mushkil lag rahaa he
 Due to the bjp's siege on this seat, the Congress had to send 44 of its mlas out of Gujarat to Karnataka
 chunaav se pehle kaddavar netaa shankar singh waghela ne congress chhod di
 His brother Balwant Singh Rajput was fielded at the instigation of the BJP
 mana ja rahaa he ki yadi congress kii taraf se cross voting hui to ahamed patel kii paanchavin baar rajyasabha chunaav pahunchane kii raah mushkil ho sakati he

 England's attitude has changed drastically after a poor performance in the World Cup 2015

 England, however, started playing aggressive cricket after that and especially with this format, they produced match winners
 abhyaas match main england ne afghanistan ko peeta, 9 wicket se harayatim ko iske shandaar nattejey bhi mili
 This can be gauged from the fact that England's ODI international team has never been such a big contender in the World Cup before and continues to top the ICC rankings

 VIDEO: bihar main saamne aayaa 700 karod rupee kaa ghotaalaa VIDEO: Rs 700 crore scam surfaced in Bihar kendra sarkaar ne apane kaarykaal kaa aakhri purna bajet pesh kar diya he
 In this budget, two facts are important for the market and industries of the Union Budget - one is the fiscal deficit figure and the other is the capital gains tax on the stock market
 vahiin is bajet ke jariye kendra sarkaar ne desh ke liye sabase badi swasth beemaa yojana kaa elaan kiya he
 According to India Today Editor Anshuman Tiwari, the main things and analysis of this last full budget of Modi government: 1
 bajet kheti - is saal ke bajet 21 lakh karod rupee ke bajet main kheti ko mili the keval 56000 karod rupee
 Above two lakh crore rupees expenditure only Food subsidy to FCI and two lakh crore rupees on fertilizer
 iskaa vishleshan- fasal samarthan mulya badhenge- mahangaai se saavdhaan - sabhi fasalon par dedh guna samarthan mulya dene kaa nitigat faisla
 Keep in mind that in 2014, the BJP government considered the high support price to be inflationary
 centre rajya sarkaron ke bajet par boj badhanaa tay he
 2
 food procincig udyog ke liye acchhee ghoshnaa- bagwani main udyog kii tarj par cluster viksit karne kii yojana
 Bihar Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, North East will benefit
 3
 The Farmers Producers Cooperative - Farmers Company Partnership - is a good experiment that is active in some states
 bajet main iske liye protsaayehan se anya rajyon main bhi ise vistanr milegaa
 4
 fasal samarthan mulya dedh guna karne kaa faisla is baat par nirbhar hoga ki sarkaar fasal kii laagat kii gananaa kaise karti he
 a new debate about the cost of farming is expected to start
 ise padhein: bajet 2018: modern hogi railway, steshnon par lagenge vaai-faai, escolator5
 The Farmers' Producers Organization will also get income tax concession
 iskaa vishveshan- fasal samarthan mulya dedh guna karne kaa faisla is baat par nirbhar hoga ki sarkaar fasal kii laagat kii gananaa kaise karti he
 a new debate about the cost of farming is expected to start
 6
 a new fund will be created under the National Housing Bank for cheap houses, but the Finance Minister did not specify its size
 iskaa vishleshan- gramin vikaas va buniyadi dhaancha skiimon kii nai packaging - sadak, shauchalay, bijli ko gramin rojgaar se joda - gramin bajet se rojgaar badhane kaa daawa kiya gaya
 Analysis of it - new program for education infrastructure but Finance Minister did not reveal the budget
 lagata he ki shiksha ke bajet main badi badhottaree nahin hui he
 7
 yah rahi # modicare- obamakare jaisi neshnal health protection skim 50 karod logon- paanch lakh rupee kaa ilaaj kawarej- vistrut byore kaa intjaar rahegaa
 Initially, this insurance scheme appears
 vishleshan - modicare par utsa hit hone se pehle pichhali pradhanmantri health beemaa yojana kaa pradarshan yaad rakhiye
 The performance of government treatment insurance schemes has been very poor
 is skim se taatkanlik phayda nijee aspataalon ko hoga
 Analysis of this- National Health Insurance Scheme, if applicable across the country, the estimated size of claims 2
 5 kharab rupee tak ho saktaa he
 How much money has been given for this in the budget has to be seen
 8
 From the eyes of the stock market - Health insurance scheme will benefit government insurance companies and private hospitals, farming declarations tractors, companies for food processing
 9
 Budget yet - In the last budget, the government has set several new floors
 chunavi saal main health beemaa, shiksha buniyadi dhaancha, laghu udyog protsaahan kaa kriyanvayan mushkil hoga
 Health insurance could have been brought earlier in the budget
 ise padhein: mobile-tivi par mahangaai kii maar, padhein kya-kya hua mahangaa10
 Budget so far - Old storeys have been forgotten
 swakachchhata mishan, fasal beemaa yojana, atal pension yojana, smart city kaa pramukhataa se zikr nahin
 The general scheme of currency was discussed
 11
 Bond Market - Companies will be diverted to the market for debt
 sebi ko di gai jimmedaari
 This step will reduce the responsibility of lending to companies on banks and will give strength to the bond and debt market
 yah kadam behad jaruri tha
 Analysis of this- FCI capital is being increased to implement the policy of increasing support price
 2014 main sarkaar epasiai punargathan karnaa chaahati thi
 The committee was also formed under the chairmanship of Shanta Kumar
 12
 Government general insurance companies will merge
 neshnal health inso rence skim unke liye sabase bada project hone vaali he
 13
 saansadon ke liye vetan ayog! har paanch saal main apane aap badhengi tankhwaa hen va bhatte
 New legislation has been proposed
 14
 Strong increase in fiscal deficit
 is saal ke liye 3
 5 percent deficit estimates
 agle saal 3
 3% target
 3
 5 to 3
 3 fisadi par laana bahut aasaan nahin hoga
 These signs are expected to be negative for the stock market
 15
 25 percent corporate tax rate for companies up to 250 crore

 Disappointment to big companies
 share bazaar kii teji par ab lagegaa brake- long turm capetail gens tex kaa chaabuk
 Ten percent tax on investments up to Rs 1 lakh

 Income tax concessions equal
 iskaa vishleshan - share bazaar par dohari maar - share bazaar pichley chaar saal kii sabase chamakdaar kahani thi
 The budget has hit it twice
 long turm capetail gens tex bhi aa gaya or rajkoshiya ghaataa bhi bad gaya

 ' Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have a strange relationship
 kejariwal hameshaa kehete hai ki piem modi unhen kaam nahin karne dete hai
 Now a new case has emerged in this debate
 arvind kejariwal ke jivan par ban rahi documentry film ko release karne se pehle unhen pradhanmantri narendra modi kii enosi leni padegi
 Actually, the film also contains some footage of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Sheila Dixit, which is why NOC is necessary before the film is released
 sensor board ne film nirdeshak ko kaha he ki pehle in donon vyaktiyon kii enosi unhen di jaae, uske baad hi is par faisla liya jayega
 According to media reports, this documentary film on AAP and Kejriwal, which stood after the agitation against corruption, has been approved by the censor board with seven cuts but due to the use of footage of PM Modi and Dixit, no objection from both (NOC) ) Has been asked to bring the certificate
 2011 andolan par ban rahi he filmapako bataa den kirashtriya film puraskaar vijeta filmkaar anand gandhi arvind kejariwal ke jivan or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf sangharsh par documentry film banaai he
 The film is based on the 2011 anti-corruption movement and the formation of the Aam Aadmi Party
 iskaa naam en incigniphicant main (ek maamuli aadmi) he
 This film, made only by keeping Arvind Kejriwal at the center, uses footage of the movement
 isamen piem modi, shila dikshit samet kai netaaon ke bare main die gaye aapattijanak bayaan bhi the
 So initially the censor board's examining committee refused to pass it
 sensor board ke adhyaksh pehlaaj nihlani kaa kahana he ki 'documentry film ko hari jhandi de di gai he lekin, niyamanusaar jinaki footage istemaal hoti he unka enosi lagata he, isliye nirmaataaon ko kaha gaya he ki ve pradhanmantri narendra modi or shila dikshit kii enosi laaen'

 maaloom ho ki party sanghathan gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko varanasi seat se chunaav ladvane kaa man bana rahaa he, jiskaa virodh murali manohar joshi kar rahe hai
 Because it is Joshi's parliamentary constituency
 sushamaa ne shriramulu ke bhi party jwine karne par virodh jataayaa he
 Apart from this, she has also expressed her opposition to joining the party of Haryana's senior Congress leader Vinod Sharma

 For the last 15 days, about 22000 Guest Teachers have been on the road in the country's capital Delhi
 1 march se 6 march tak ye shikshak apni roji-roti ko bachaane ke liye dilli ke shiksha mantri manish sisodiya se guhaar laga rahe the
 On 6 March, Manish Sisodia stamped their demands in an emergency meeting of the cabinet and prepared a note on the job guarantee for 60 years and handed it over to the Deputy Governor of Delhi, Anil Baijal
 press conference main manish sisodiya ne kaha ki hamane apana kaam kar diya he, ab up-rajyapal ko isapar faisla lenaa he
 Because in Delhi, the authority related to service mater is with the Lieutenant Governor
 aise main 7 march ko bheed manish sisodiya ke ghar se uthakar up-rajyapal ke daftar ke baahar pahunch gai
 Guest teachers performing outside Manish Sisodia's house When these guest teachers were outside Manish Sisodia's house, they were chanting the same slogan- (WE WANT POLICY)
 lekin jaise hi sisodiya ne kaha ki hamane apane hisse kaa kaam kar diya he, ab BJP ko apane hisse kaa kaam karnaa chahie
 As expected, guest teachers sat on a dharna outside LG Anil Baijal's house and started shouting (WE WANT SIGNATURE)
 darasal, jab atithi shikshak manish sisodiya ke ghar ke baahar dharne par the
 Then Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari had reached among them and assured all possible help
 shikshakon ko laga ki ab unki mehnat rang laane vaali he
 Manoj Tiwari reached among the teachers and told them that they would talk to the Lieutenant Governor on this issue
 iske baad manoj tiwari ne masale ko lekar LG se mulaakaat kii
 After the meeting, he said that only note has been given by the Education Minister Manish Sisodia to the Lieutenant Governor
 jisamen shikshakon ke liye 60 saal tak job sicyor karne kii maang kii gai he
 Manoj Tiwari assured that not a single guest teacher will be removed
 lekin shikshakon kaa kahana he ki is babat abhi tak skool main koi circular nahin pahunchaa he
 There is deep resentment among the teachers that they are constantly being pressurized (hos) to join the school
 jabaki unka 28 farvari 2019 ko hi contract khatm ho chukaa he
 In such a situation, teachers are only getting assurances from every side, but everyone is worried about how the job will be saved
 shikshakon kaa kahana he ki manoj tiwari ne kaha ki ek bhi atithi shikshak ko 31 agast 2019 tak nahin hataaya jayega, isko lekar unki up-rajyapal anil baijal se baat hui he
 But no written circular has been drawn in this context
 vahiin duusari taraf skulon main Post Fixation Report (PFC) pahunch chuki he or atithi shikshakon ko nikaalane kii taiyaari chal rahi he
 Thousands of guest teachers will be relieved as soon as PFC is implemented from 1 April
 uske baad pramotion kii list aani vaali he, usase bhi hajaaron atithi shikshak baahar kar die jaaenge
 Then how Manoj Tiwari is saying that till August 31, the job of all guest teachers is safe
 is masale ko lekar hamane manoj tiwari se sampark karne kii koshish kii, lekin unase baat nahin ho pai
 22 thousand guest teachers upset about going to the job, we talked to Govind Singh, president of Delhi Guest Teachers Association
 unka kahana he ki atithi shikshak ko lekar na to dilli sarkaar gambhir he, or na hi bhartiya janata party ke bade netaa
 He said, 'the service mater is with the Lieutenant Governor, only the Lieutenant Governor can take a decision on it
 up-rajyapal hi policy banavaane sambandhit aadesh ajukeshan department chif ko de sakate hai
 Govind Singh said that on 4 October 2017 the Delhi government had passed a bill in the Assembly to ensure guest teachers which are still under consideration with the Lieutenant Governor
 unhone kaha ki us vakt bijepi ke dwaara kaha gaya tha ki agar dilli sarkaar keval ek job guarantee note cabinet se paas karwaakar up-rajyapal ko saunp degi to use kanoonee prakriya ke tahat LG house se aage badha diya jayega
 But now again BJP is doing politics on the issue
 14 din se apni maangon ko lekar sadak par atithi shikshakavahin is maamle ko lekar hamane pichley 15 dinon se dharne kii aguwai kar rahe ol india guest teachers association ke adhyaksh praveen tobadiya se sampark kiya
 He says that until the demands are met, the teachers will stand on the dharna
 kyonki shikshakon ke paas ab khone ke liye kuch nahin he, 28 farvari se sabhi shikshak job se baahar hai
 He said that during the dharna, one day the police forcibly picked up the guest teachers and took them to the police station, during which many guest teachers were mistreated
 unhone kaha ki congress netaa kiran walia kii madad se phir unke saathi chhudaae gayen
 Praveen Tobria told that Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari had assured that he was serious about this issue and would talk to Lt
 Governor Anil Baijal
 unhone kaha ki 8 march ko manoj tiwari atithi shikshakon ko lekar LG se milane gaye
 During this 7 minute meeting, the guest teachers were given only one minute to speak
 LG se mulaakaat ke baad baahar nikalakar manoj tiwari ne kaha ki 60 saal kii policy ko lekar kanoonee madad kii jarurat he, jisko lekar department apana karegaa
 Because this policy should not be dismissed later in the court
 14wein din kuch is tarah virodh karte atithi shikshakatobadiya kaa kahana he ki bheed ko sambodhit karte hue manoj tiwari ne shikshakon se kaha tha ki 31 agast tak kisi shikshak ko skool se nahin hataaya jayega, isko lekar unki up-rajyapal se baat hui he
 But no written circular has been issued till date
 jabaki skulon main PFC ke jariye shikshakon ko hataane ke liye list taiyaar kii ja rahi he
 He clearly said that Manoj Tiwari is misleading the teachers
 agar 31 agast tak koi shikshak nahin hataae jaaenge to unhen isko lekar circular nikalvaanaa chahie
 He said that guest teachers have been demanding their rights outside Delhi BJP office for the last one week
 lekin unki sud nahin lee ja rahi he
 Female guest teachers are reaching the strike site with their young children
 kyonki job chale jane se wo vaise hi sadak par aa gai hai
 However, he said that until written assurance is received on his demands, till then all 22 thousand guest teachers will continue to struggle
 shikshakon ko kahana he ki jis tarah haryana main bijepi sarkaar ne shikshakon ko regular kiya he usee tarah dilli main unhen 60 saal ke liye pakki naukari di jaae
 a double century in odis is also considered a feat, so what would a triple century in T20 be called? Mohit Ahlawat, 21, who was part of the Delhi Ranji team, has become the first batsman to score 300 runs in T20 cricket
 dilli main hue ek local toornament frends premier lig main mohit ne sirf 72 gendon par naabad 300 ran thok daale

 He said that he also tries to put helicopter shots of Dhoni
 apni is pari ke baad unhone apane coach sanjay bharadwaj kii bhi taareef kii or kaha ki unhen bharadwaj sar se acchhee training mil rahi he
 Like cricketers like Gautam Gambhir, Unmukt Chand and Amit Mishra, Mohit's coach Sanjay Bhardwaj, who trains at Lal Bahadur Shastri Academy, is also surprised by his disciple's feats
 coach sanjay bharadwaj kehete hai, "kamaal kii baat he
 i am surprised to see this score
 lekin mohit bahut pratibhashali he
 It (firoz Shah) has also hit an innings of 150 runs on the ground like Kotla
 vah ek sef wicketiper ballebaaz he or iske shots, cricketting shots hote hai
 i think it will get a chance on the big stage as well
 " Significantly, the record of the biggest innings in T20 in IPL is in the name of Chris Gayle who scored an unbeaten 175 runs against the Pune Warriors in 2013 for Royal Challengers Bangalore
 antarrashtriya T20 main sarvaadhik ranon kaa score australia ke aron finch (banaam england, southampton main 29 agast 2013 ko) ke naam he jinhone us pari main 63 gendon par 156 ran banaae the
 After this innings, Mohit told NDTV correspondent that he is a big fan of MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli
 unhone kaha ki ve dhoni ke helicopter shots ko lagane kii bhi koshish bhi karte hai
 After this innings, he also praised his coach Sanjay Bhardwaj and said that he is getting good training from Bhardwaj sir
 gautam gambhir, unmukt chand or amit mishra jaise cricketron kii tarah laal bahadur shastri academy main training karne vaale mohit ke coach sanjay bharadwaj bhi apane shishy ke karname se hairaan hai
 Coach Sanjay Bhardwaj says, "amazing
 is score ko dekhakar main hairaan hum
 But Mohit is very talented
 isane (firozshah) kotla jaise ground par bhi dedh sau ranon kii pari kheli he
 He is a safe wicketkeeper batsman and has shots, cricketing shots
 mujhe lagata he ise bade stage par bhi mauqaa milegaa

 college kii suhaani yaadon main khaas jagah rakhte hai teachers
 Later, someone scolds or learns from a teacher always goes along
 vaise, kuch khaas tarah ke teachers har kisi kii jindagi kaa hissaa rahete hai
 We have prepared a list of such teachers
 aap bhi padhein or kahen ki are ye to mere vahi vaale teacher hai
 
 
 1
 kabhi chuttee na lene vaale teacher:'are aaj bhi ye sar aae hai, ye kabhi of kyon nahin lete
 Give a free period at any time
 ' vah bhale hi apana kaam shiddat se karte hon lekin raaj aane vaale teachers us samay to aapako kabhi pasand nahin aate honge
 By the way, you are not the only one to think like this, but we have all been troubled by the regular attendance of one teacher
 2
 Teachers with strict discipline: silent
 
 
 yah unka pasandida dialog hota he or zyada anushaasan pasand karne vaale aise kisi na kisi teacher se sabhi apni student life main pareshaan hote hai
 It was difficult for him to leave class because of his fear and he also used to focus more on his students' activities than teaching
 3
 Teacher repeating the same thing: You must have been bored listening to these things
 ek hi kahani unhone aapako baar-baar sunai hogi
 While listening to their stories, you might feel that someone has kept a tape recorder nearby
 4
 Teacher who wandered from the topic: i remember that once the class atmosphere was very serious, some difficult question was being discussed
 hamen pataa tha ki shakespeare kii hiroine hamaare shikshak kii sabase badi kamajori hai
 Just from there, someone asked 'sir, how good it would have been if Desdimona had not died in Othello
 ' bas phir kya tha samay samaapt hone tak sar usee par bolte rahe
 5
 klules teacher:kuch aise teacher bhi aapaki jindagi main aae honge, jinke mood ke bare main pataa lagaana sabase mushkal kaam hoga
 On what such teachers would be happy and angry on what it was like a top secret
 or to or padhaate samay bhi kai baar vah kanphyus hi najar aate the
 5
 da great story tailor:kuch shikshak skool main aise bhi hote hai, jinke paas kahaniyon kaa bhandar hota he
 They solve any of your problems through the story
 kahani khatm hone par pataa chalata he ki us kahani se aapaki samasya dur ho gai he
 They also have the ability to make it easier by telling heavy sources of science through the story
 6
 Quickly irritating teacher: Why should you answer their questions no matter how much they start getting irritated on your point very soon
 aapako baton ko sunakar hameshaa ye apana bal khujalana shuru kar denge
 There have been very few occasions in your school-college time when they have told you something good
 7
 Rockstar Teacher: Every type of teacher must have met this type of teacher
 inke paas aapaki har samasya kaa samaadhaan hota he
 They are adept at doing everything
 skool yaa college ke saare program main ye aise dilchaspee lete hai, jaise unke ghar kaa program ho
 The most special thing about them is that they are very friendly and they also remember a lot after leaving school or college
