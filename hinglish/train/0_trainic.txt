 ' Asus ne nae smartphone Zenfone 3S Max ko farvari ke maheene main launch kiya tha
 We used this smartphone and after using it completely, we are sharing a review of this smartphone with you
 aaj tak ke is rivyuu ke baad aap khud tay kar sakate hai ki ise aapako khareednaa chahie yaa nahin
 Let us tell you that Asus launched Zenfone 3S Max after Zenfone Max and Zenfone 3 Max
 bild qualityis smartphone kii bild quality isaki keemat ke hisaab se kaaphi acchhee he
 This is a smartphone with full metal unbody design
 or 5000mah kii bydaree ke hisaab se iskaa vajan bhi graahakon ko raas aa jayega
 5 in it
 2-inch HD (720x1280 picksal) disple diya gaya he
 Also 2
 5D karvd glass kaa feel haath main pakadaney se sidhe taur par mahasoos hota he
 a sharp and colorful image can be seen in its display
 is smartphone kii body phinishing bhi kaaphi shandaar he
 Its fingerprint scanner is also given in the front of this smartphone and the company's claims prove to be right here because it is really fast
 jahaan tak iske disple ko handle karne kii baat he to isamen van hand mod, tach jescher, moshan jescher, in bilt bluelite filter ke saath font sies or disple sies ko edjust karne kaa opshan maujuud he
 This is the first smartphone in the company's line up with a fingerprint scanner at the front which makes it easier to use
 haalanki is smartphone kaa disple tach ko risive nahin karata jisaki vajah se fast chating main yugers ko pareshaani ho sakati he
 Famous batteries: Now come to talk about the biggest feature of this smartphone, that is its battery
 isamen 5,000mah kii bydaree di gai he jo vaaki behad shandaar he
 We used it continuously in 4G and wi-fi, played games continuously, watched videos for many hours but its battery was not affected much
 agar aap is smartphone ko puri tarah charge kar lete hai to ye hamaare upyog ke mutabik 2 din tak normal yuj main chalaaya ja saktaa he
 Also, this smartphone has a power saving mode along with super power saving mode
 jo aapaki bydaree kaa khyaal rakhane main aapaki madad karata he
 You can also use this smartphone for reverse charging because of its powerful battery
 yani kii OTG adepter kii madad se duusare divaais ko bhi charge kar sakate hai
 However, its battery charges a little slowly
 Android kaa letest varjan ise banaata he khasaye smartphone andrid 7
 0 runs on Nougat, which is rarely seen in this price
 is lihaaj se ye kaaphi behatar he
 It already has many apps such as pre-loaded Asus zenfit which are rarely used by people and cannot be uninstalled
 aise main aap phone kaa ram bachaane ke liye in eps ko disable kar sakate hai
 Talking about hardware, it has 3GB RAM, 32GB internal storage and Octa core Mediatek MT6750 processor
 aap isamen aasaani se bina ruke HD video dekh sakate hai, games khel sakate hai or multiple windo par kaam bhi kar sakate hai
 But according to our usage, this smartphone is extremely hot in the back
 zyada charge karen yaa zyada der upyog karen yaa normal dhoop main bhi rahen to aapako is smartphone kii garmaahat kaa andaja ho jayega
 Talking about some special features in this, Google's virtual assistant has been given in this smartphone
 isaki madad se aap smartphone ko bina tach kiye hi bahut saare kaam kar sakate hai
 Apart from this, the option of Kids Mode has also been provided, so that parents will not have to worry while giving their phone to their children
 ek baat or karne vaali he wo he iskaa mujeec segment, iskaa yearphone to behad khaas banaaya gaya he, lekin hamen bahut dhundne ke baad bhi iskaa mujeec player nahin mila
 It also did not get strong voice in homes after Home Theater Time Connect
 haalanki yugers google mujeec player se isamen gaanaa sun sakate hai
 Now come to the most important thing is its camera department
 iske rier main dual LED flash ke saath 13 megapixl kaa camera he vahiin iske front main 8 megapixl kaa camera diya gaya he
 Selfie has options like beauty mode, time lapse, HDR Pro and filters, on the other hand it has the option of taking selfies from the most special rear camera with manual focus, super resolution, manual options in the rear
 front camera to he hi iske alaava back camere se bhi selfi lee ja sakati he
 But its camera has disappointed a lot even after having so many options
 kyonki is keemat main duusare smartfones main kahin zyada behatar camere maujuud hai
 You will have to face the biggest problem in focusing on this smartphone first
 photo kii quality din main focus ek baar baith jane ke baad thik hi milegi
 But even after having low light features at night, there will be clearly visible noises
 jisase itane fitures ke baavjood iskaa camera thik sabit nahin ho paata
 Overall, this smartphone is good for battery but in terms of camera, this segment is a very weak smartphone

e
 9 less than the magic figure of the majority
 is simavarti rajya main 2012 main ek bhi seat na paane vaali bhaajapa ke liye yah vaaki marke kii uplabdhi thi
 In this way, Sarma's confidence in forming the government was beyond comprehension
 isamen do raay nahin ki assam main bijepi kii jeet ke sutaradhar ko yah bakhubi maaloom he ki prachaar kaise chalaanaa he or kya ranneeti banani he
 The BJP already had a pre-election informal alliance with the Naga People's Front (NPF)
 enpief ko pahaado main chaar siten mili hai
 The BJP had not entered into a formal alliance with the NPF in the hope that it might have the opposite effect among the local Maiti people
 miti logon kii naga logon se hameshaa thani rahati he
 Former Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh tried to provoke the sentiments of the Maitis by saying that the peace agreement that the Modi government has signed with the issac-muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-IM) can go against the Maitis 
 ibobi singh ne centre ko chunauti bhi di ki samjhaute kii sharton kaa khulaasa kiya jaae

 In addition, he got five seats from the mountains

 In this way the number of mlas in support of BJP increased to 33

 Sarma presented the legislators in front of Governor Najma Heptulla on 12 March

 Due to limitations on the size of the cabinet in the state, only 12 ministers including the Chief Minister can be made in Manipur
 yah teen sahyogi dalon or kuch anya ko khush karne ke liye kam hi hoga
 The NPF may not change the ground, but the NPP may threaten to go with the Congress if it does not get a good post

 Shailendra Pandey - Astrologer nae saal kii shuruyaat ho chuki he
 In the new year everyone will try to be financially strong but it would be surprising to know that every person in India has an average debt of more than 62 thousand rupees
 yah karj kaise or kyon he, iskaa ganit ham aapako samajhaate hai
 In fact, recently the Government Debt Management of the Ministry of Finance has given a quarterly report
 is report main bataaya gaya he ki sarkaar kaa kul karj sitambar ke ant tak badhkar 82 lakh karod rupee pahunch gaya he
 Calculating according to the country's population of 134 crores, every citizen has a debt of about 62 thousand rupees
 report ke mutabik isi saal june ke ant tak sarkaar par yah karj 79
 8 lakh crores
 vahiin tab isi aabaadi ke anusaar aap par karj 59 hajaar 552 rupee tha
 That is, you have increased your debt by Rs 2,448 in just three months
 vahiin sarkaar par in teen maheene main 2
 Additional debt of Rs 2 lakh crore has increased
 kyon badha karjvitt mantralay kii is report kii maane to sarkaar par karj badhane kii kai vajah hai
 The first biggest reason is the rise in crude oil prices
 iske alaava dollar ke khilaaf rupee ke mulya main giravat or america fed-bhartiya rigerv bank dwaara daron main badhotaree se bhi dendaree main badhotaree hui he
 The report also states that about 26

 Peaked at 18 percent
 vahiin 11 saal kii macurity avadhi vaali baandon ko chhod anya sabhi baandon par yield vruddhi hui he
 The returns or earnings on bonds are called yields
 band yield main jokhim kam hota he isliye isamen ritern bhi kam hota he
 This debt will increase further! This debt is going to increase further on the government or you
 darasal, america kii aarthik nitiyon kii nigaraanee karne vaali sanstha rigerv fed ne haal hi main byaaj daron main badhotaree kii thi
 Along with this, it was indicated that interest rates may be increased again in the coming days
 badhotaree ke is sanket kaa asar bhartiya arthvyavastha par bhi pad saktaa he
 However, the Reserve Bank can help recover this debt by cutting interest rates
 karj badhata gaya to aap par kya asar hogugar karj badhata gaya to iskaa asar mahangaai ke jariye hoga
 RBI also believes that the risk of inflation is increasing in the coming year

 Ishant took two for 23 in eight overs, while Praveen took one wicket for eight runs in eight overs

 At lunch, Darren Bravo was on 17, while veteran Shivnarayan Chanderpaul was playing 11 runs
 donon chauthe wicket ke liye ab tak 29 ran jod chuke hai
 Batting after losing the toss, the West Indies team tried to get a vigilant start by Barath and Powell, but both Ishant and Praveen's exact bowling found it difficult for both batsmen to score runs
 donon ballebaaj aath over tak wicket par date rahe, lekin iske baad test cricket main padaarpan kar rahe yuva pavel ko praveen ne outswinger par duusari slip main vivies lakshmana ke haathon kaich kara diya
 Ishant, who took 16 wickets in the first two Tests, then sent Barath to the pavilion

 ishanth ne haalanki agle over main is test ke saath padaarpan kar rahe crirk edwards ko wicket ke peeche captain mahendra singh dhoni ke haathon kaich kara diya
 On TV replays, however, it was felt that Ishant's bouncer touched the helmet, not Kirk Edwards' bat but reached Dhoni's gloves
 braavo ne iske baad shivanrayan chandrapal ke saath milakar pari ko sambhala or lunch tak team ko or jatke nahin lagane diye
 However, exciting clashes continue between the two teams

 Yogguru said that today the whole world is ready to imbibe Indian culture, civilization and education
 unhone kaha ki hamen 2016 se 2050 tak aisa maahaul bananaa he jisase bharat puri duniya kaa netritv kare
 As soon as the marriage is fixed, people start drowning in the dream of honeymoon
 kalpana kii oonchi udaan bharte hue kai baar jode honeymoon kaa plan banaate vakt yaa honeymoon ke dauraan aisi galtiyaan kar baithte hai, jo unka majaa kam kar detii hai
 These mistakes can be avoided by taking care of some important things on the honeymoon
 to honeymoon par jane se pehle hi rakhen dhyaan, bhuulakar bhi na karen ye 10 galtiyaan
 
 
 1
 kahaan janaa he, sochakar karen faislahnimoon par kahaan janaa he, iskaa faisla soch-samajhakar karen
 Go to the place which is more comfortable and pleasant in the season
 sukun vaali jagah chune, jahaan aap donon relax kar saken
 It should not be that you get so tired of being in a state of adventure, that you can fall asleep while going to bed
 2
 Avoid more fancy dress Newly married couples often have lots of new dress on the occasion of marriage
 khaskar ladakiyon ke paas fancy dress or undergarments kii bharmaar hoti he
 Leave the temptation to take these fancy clothes with you on honeymoon
 sirf kapadon kii sundarataa par na jaaen
 These must see how comfortable the clothes are
 jab 'andar kii baat' ho, to 'maamla aaraam kaa' hona hi chahie
 3
 mobile kaa istemaal kam karenhanemoon par mobile kaa istemaal kam se kam karen
 It is not that your spouse is facing you and you are in the grip of whatsapp and Facebook
 jab tak zyada jaruri na ho, phone par lambii-lambii baaten katai na karen
 In such a situation, there is bound to be annoyance in your partner's mind
 4
 Don't look at other couples too much on honeymoon
 ladakon ko chahie ki ve duusari ladakiyon par zyada najar daalane se bachein
 This thing can knock his life partner
 ladakiyon se bhi kuch aisi hi apeksha kii jaati he
 One more thing to note
 ladakiyon ko bhi yah baat samajni chahie uskaa pati abhi-abhi hi bachaler life se baahar aayaa he
 In such a situation, it may take some time to change his habits completely
 5
 Make a budget first, then go on a honeymoon
 Before going on a honeymoon, calculate the amount you want to spend or the total cost for the honeymoon
 isi ke mutabik apni yojana banaaen
 It should not happen that both of you start crying for the expenses while on honeymoon or while returning from there
 kehane kaa matlab yah he ki aap pehle se hi bajet banaakar chalem, taaki baad main koi pareshaani na ho
 6
 ekadam sahaj rahen, acting se bachembistar par kamkrida ke vakt ekadam sahaj rahen
 In many cases, girls either wish to be too shy or want to show themselves excessively cool
 ye donon hi baaten thik nahin he
 Whatever you are, look the same in front of your spouse
 7
 Don't experiment too much
 Avoid making different experiments while making sex relations
 pehle se suni-sunai baton yaa tips ko turant aajamaane kii jaldbaaji na karen
 Keep in mind that you have to connect emotionally well with your life partner first
 dil main jagah banaakar hi aap anya kisi sukh hi chaah kar sakate hai
 This is necessary for the strengthening of the relationship
 8
 Use Dio thoughtfully, on honeymoon, there is more attraction towards each other, for this you can use perfume and dio etc
 par itnaa jarur dhyaan rakhen ki in chizon kaa istemaal apane partner kii pasand ke mutabik hi ho
 It is not that your partner starts having problems due to the strong smell
 aap pehle se hi apane partner kii pasand puch len, to behatar
 9
 kamare ko thik se dekh lenjab bhi aap honeymoon par jaaen, to hotel kaa chunaav bahut hi saavdhaanee se karen
 Briefly check the room of the hotel that you choose, if there is any threat to your privacy in it
 antarang sambandh kaayam karte vakt lite kaa istemaal soch-samajhakar hi karen
 You may also have a 'third look' on you
 sheesha yaa aaine ke aage khadey hone se pehle bhi satark ho jaaen, kyonki vah khaas tarah kaa, paardarshee bhi ho saktaa he
 Look at the things kept in the room that there is no hidden camera in it
 aapako zyada darane yaa ghabaraane kii jarurat to nahin he, par jo kuch din-duniya main ho rahaa he, uske prati jaagruk to hona hi chahie
 10
 ghar va offis kii chintaa saath na le jaaenghar or offis kii chintaa honeymoon par saath le jane kaa ksht haragij na uthaaen
 Thinking about the problems will not solve it, but the joy of the opposite life will be spoiled

 varsh 1964 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri ne gujarat main aanand kaa daura kiya taaki amul kii safalataa ko khud apni najaron se dekh saken
 He requested Varghese Kurien to arrange an overnight stay in a nearby milk producing village like a normal citizen
 ve chaahate the ki logon ko unke pad ke bare main maaloom na chale
 Kurien saham
 ve kaise kisi pradhanmantri ko bagaiyr kisi suraksha yaa sahyog tantra ke raat bhar kisi gaanv main tehra sakate hai
 But on the insistence of Prime Minister Shastri, he was left to spend the night in a nearby village without disclosing his security details
 shastri gaanv main tahaltey hue gaye or apana parichay raah bhatke ek yatri ke rup main diya
 a family in the village invited Shastri to live with him

 i am confident that the release of 'padmavati' will not affect our film
 akshay kumaar ne kaha ki 'pedman' apni patakatha kii vajah se jarur saxes hogi

 According to a recent study, in the sonbhadra-singrauli area, mercury (mercury) has been found not only in the air, water, soil but also in the blood samples of the people living here
 yah insaan ke dimagi santulan ko bigaadta he or chikitsakeey drushti se aatmahatya kaa mukhya kaaran he
 The NGT has said in its order that the presence of mercury in the Rihand Dam is due to fly ash, for which the power houses nearby are responsible

 This was the second case within a few months

 Every year from the consumption of such a large amount of coal, 3
 5 karod ton raakh paidaa hoti he, jiskaa paryaapt istemaal ho nahin paa rahaa
 In fact, the central government had also issued a notification in the year 2009 and then in 2015, about the use of ash emanating from power houses, under which if any industry wants to use fly ash, then the power house will not only give them ash for free If the industry is within 100 km radius, then the power house will also bear the entire cost of transportation
 agar udyog 300 kimi ke daayre main ho to vahaan tak raakh pahunchane main lage parivahan laagat kaa aadha-aadha hissaa vah udyog or bijlighar milakar uthaaenge
 Still no one is willing to raise ashes from places like Singrauli

 pichley do saalon main sena ke pramukh cmanderon ne 100 karod rupee se bhi zyada janata kaa paisa gairajaruri chizon main kharch kar diya he
 This disclosure came in an internal investigation conducted by the Ministry of Defense
 is jaanch ke nateezon ke baad naaraaz rakshaamantri eke antni ne aadesh diya he ki aage se sena ke commander tamaam maukon par pehle mantralay se manjuuri lene ke baad hi kharchaa karenge
 This case is not just a matter of extravagance, the investigation also shows that the rules set in the purchase of equipment from abroad have also been ignored
 aashcharya kii baat to yah he ki sena ke hi ek ang ne jis upkaran ko nakaar diya tha usee upkaran ko duusare ang ne kharida
 Investigative reports in the case of wastage of government funds say that the communication equipment made in China is purchased by the generals using their privileges (purchase in emergency) in their respective areas
 yahaan par bhi ghotaalaa yah he ki company se saamaan kharidne ke bajaae in logon ne dallalon ke madhyam se yah kharid kii he
 It is also mentioned in the investigation that if the same equipment was purchased from an Indian company, then it could be found very cheaply
 report main is baat kii shankaa jaahir kii gai he ki yah upkaran kalabazar se kharide gaye hai
 The report also mentions that brokers were also used in procurement from companies where foreign companies are manufacturing equipment in India
 gauratlab he ki china main taiyaar tamaam sanchaar upkarnon main chori kaa software laga hota he
 All foreign security agencies and China have also used them to collect important secret information
 sena kii guptchar shakha ke pramukh ne upkaran kii kharid ke sambandh main kai disha-nirdesh jari kiye hai
 All this purchase has been done in violation of those rules
 report kahati he ki vittiya ghapalon ke alaava in kharid main desh kii suraksha ke saath bhi samjhauta kiya gaya he
 The report reveals that Eastern Command bought a higher price from an Indian broker for the purchase of better binoculars while the company manufacturing the same equipment is selling it in the market at cheaper prices
 isi tarah sena mukhyalay ne jis bulatopruf jacket ko nimna darje kii vajah se nakaar diya tha, usee ke uttari cmand ne kharida
 Significantly, after the order of the Defense Minister, the CDA had ordered an inquiry into the purchase between 2009-10 and 2010-11 by army commanders exercising special financial powers
 philhal sidie ne saat main chah cmand ke maatr 55 maamalon kii jaanch kii he or bataaya he ki inamen 103
 a loss of 11 crores has been estimated
 vibhaag nuksaan kaa sahi akalan is vajah se bhi nahin laga paaya kyonki tamaam maamalon main record ko sahi tareeke se rakhaa nahin gaya
 The comments is puure prakaran main sabase gambhir baat yah he ki sena ke kisi bhi commander ne kharid kii puri jaankaree nahin di he
 The report states that despite the purchase order, the supply of goods has taken from one to three years
 isse saaf jaahir hota he ki in upkarnon kii jald main kharidi kii aisi koi jarurat nahin thi
 Another adverse comment has been made on the Army commanders in the report which states that while the auditors are stationed in the army offices, the commanders keep them intimidated
 sena ke commander hi in auditoron ke pramotion main ahm bhoomika nibhaate hai
 Under all this, the report says that the financial privilege in the hands of army commanders should not be increased further and this rule should be revisited

 yah maamla maatr phijulkharjee kaa nahin he, jaanch yah bhi bataati he ki videshon se upkaran kharid main tay niyamon kii bhi andekhi kii gai he
 The surprising thing is that the equipment which was rejected by one part of the army bought the same equipment from the other
 sarkari dhan kii barabaadi ke maamle main kii gai jaanch report kahati he ki china main bane sanchaar upkarnon ko generalon main apane-apane kshetra main apane visheshadhikaar (immergency main kharid) kaa istemaal karte hue kharida he
 The scam here is that instead of buying goods from the company, these people have made this purchase through brokers
 jaanch main is baat kaa bhi zikr he ki yadi yahi upkaran bhartiya company se kharide gaye hote tab kaaphi saste main mil sakate the
 It is suspected in the report that this equipment has been purchased from Kalabazar
 report main is baat kaa bhi zikr he ki un companiyon se kharid main bhi dallalon kaa prayog kiya gaya jahaan videsh companiyaan bharat main hi upkaran kaa nirmaan kar rahi hai
 It is worth noting that all communication devices manufactured in China have stolen software
 tamaam videshi suraksha agenciyaan or china bhi inkaa prayog mahatvapurn gupt jaankariyon ko ekatra karne ke liye karata rahaa he
 The head of the intelligence wing of the army has issued several guidelines regarding the purchase of equipment
 yah sari kharid un niyamon kaa ulanghan karke kii gai he
 The report says that apart from financial scams, the security of the country has also been compromised in these purchases
 report main khulaasa he ki behatar doorabeen kii kharid ke liye purvi cmand ne bhartiya dalal se oonche daamon main kharide jabaki vahi upkaran nirmaan kar rahi company saste daamon par bazaar main bech rahi he
 Similarly, the Northern Command purchased the bulletproof jacket which was rejected by the Army Headquarters due to low status
 gauratlab he ki sidie ne rakshaamantri ke aadesh ke baad 2009-10 or 2010-11 ke bich sena cmanderon dwaara vishesh vittiya adhikaron kaa prayog kar kharid kii jaanch karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 Currently, the CDA has investigated only 55 command cases in seven and reported that 103 of them
 11 karod kaa nuksaan kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya he
 The department could not assess the damage properly because the records were not maintained properly in all the cases
 tippaniyan The most serious thing in this whole episode is that no commander of the army has given full details of the purchase
 report bataati he ki kharid ke aadesh ke baavjood maal kii supplai main ek se lekar teen saal tak kaa samay laga he
 This clearly shows that there was no such need for early purchase of these devices
 report main sena ke cmanderon par ek or pratikul tippanee kii gai he jo kahati he ki jabaki auditor sena kii karyaalayon main tainaat hai lekin commander unhen daraa-dhamkaakar rakhte hai
 The commander of the army plays an important role in the promotion of these auditors
 in sab baton ke tahat report kahati he ki sena ke cmanderon ke haath main vittiya visheshadhikaar ko or nahin badhaayaa janaa chahie or saath hi is niyam kaa punarikshan kiya janaa chahie

 India Today Conclave 2019 'ghanti rang for: temple, textbooks, divorce' When Hinduism and Hindutva were presenting their perspective, they were very pleasant to hear
 apane vichaar rakhte samay tharur or sahasrabuddhe donon ne desh ke maujuuda rajnatik paridrishy ke sandarbh main isaki avadharana kii vyakhya kii
 Tharoor said that the BJP has brought Hindutva into the political arena, while Sahasrabuddhe claimed that it has always been and can be understood from the hymns of Mahatma Gandhi
 tharur ne hindutv ko sankeernata se itar sabko apane saath samahit karne vaali ek vyapak avadharana bataaya
 Sahasrabudhe said that Hindutva also accepts diversity
 donon ne sabarimala, teen talaak or gaay par raajnneeti jaise muddon par apni-apni party ke rukh kaa bachaav kiya
 Both rejected the claim that their party's opinion on these subjects was inspired by some political implications rather than a deep philosophical churn
 ththkhaas batenshashi tharur ne hindu dharm or hindutv ke bich antar bataate hue kaha ki hindu dharm jahaan sarvyaapee or sabko samahit karne vaala vichaar he vahiin hindutv iskaa ek sankeern drushtikon saamne rakhata he
 According to him, the views of political parties on the issue of eating beef vary from state to state
 haalanki, unhone kaha ki sabhi ko samvidhan ke tahat alpsankhyakon sahit sabhi bharatiyon ko praapt naagarik adhikaron kaa sammaan karnaa chahie
 "non-hindu aspects like non-violence, violation of the principles of truth and acceptance are the biggest hindrances of Hindutva
 ''vinay sahasrabuddhe kehete hai ki hindutv ko hameshaa galat sandarbhon main samajha gaya he
 Both Hindutva and Hinduism are not separate, but two different paths to reach the same truth
 unke anusaar, congress kii tushtikaran kii niti ke falswaroop musalmaan pichhadate chale gaye kyonki congress ne musalamaanon kii pragati main madad karne main dilchaspee nahin lee, balki unhen keval ek vot bank ke rup main dekha he, jo bhaajapa nahin kar rahi he
 "unfortunately, many people have seen Hindutva in the wrong contexts and it has become such an innocent creature that people like Shashi Tharoor enjoy with whips
" ''*** Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan is very concerned about the attack on Buxar during the review visit of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 unka kahana he ki mukhyamantri ke saath itani suraksha rahati he iske baavjood yah ghatana ghati

 is divaais kii keemat 1500 rupye rakhane ke saath hi unhone iske patent ke liye bhi aavedan kiya he
 Aishwarya and Devyani said that increasing awareness about mental hygiene has led to an increase in sales of disposable sanitary pads
 haalanki sainitory pads ke atyadhik istemaal kii vajah se ise dyspose karne kii bhi chunauti saamne khadi ho gai he
 In such a situation, this device named 'cleanz Right' can prove to be very effective
 'cleanse rhite' ko chalaane ke liye bijli kii jarurat nahin he
 It consists of paddle-operated plungers, which move in a chamber filled with water
 yah plungers kapadon ke pad se menstrial blad khinchakar pani se saaf kar dete hai
 Another special thing of this device is that in this, you will be able to wash the little clothes of children easily
 chaatraon kaa daawa he ki is divaais se riujeble hone vaale sanitry pad puri tarah se surakshit hai

 bihar main congress kii haar ke liye mahagathbandhan ko jimmedaar bataaya ja rahaa he
 The party convened a meeting in Patna under the chairmanship of state president Madan Mohan Jha to brainstorm the defeat
 haalanki, baithak main kai jiladhyaksh nahin pahunche or kuch ne bahishkaar bhi kiya
 Most of the district heads who attended the meeting admitted that the Congress suffered due to the alliance
 jiladhyakshon ne haar ke liye ummidavaaron ke chayan ko lekar sawaal uthaaya or kaha ki pehle to rashtriya party hone ke naate mahaj 9 seat mila jo kisi tarah se sammanjanak nahi hai
 On the other hand, there was also a game of seat sharing, where the Congress was in a good position and could win there, then it was given to the smaller parties involved in the grand alliance
 congress ke rajyasabha saansad or chunaav abhiyaan samiti ke adhyaksh akhilesh prasad singh ne kaha ki hamen mithilanchal main seat milani chahie thi
 Our seat of Darbhanga was won
 agar kirti aaazaad ko darbhanga seat se ladaaya jaataa to nishchit rup se hamaari jeet hoti
 The meeting also raised questions about the alliance with the RJD and said that the opposition within the RJD and opposition to the upper-caste reservation was overwhelming, which led to their defeat
 congress ke kai netaaon ne aarope lagaaya ki sahyogi dalon ne chunaav main congress ke kaaryakartaaon ko poocha tak nahin tha
 In Bihar, Congress contested elections by forming grand alliance with RJD and other smaller parties
 kul 40 siton main se 39 siten endie ko milin, jabaki ek kishanganj kii seat congress ne jeeta
 Other parties in the Grand Alliance did not get a single seat
 kishanganj se bhi congress kii jeet kaaphi kam margin se hui, jaise-taise jeet hui
 All the Congress District Presidents boycotted the meeting where the candidate of the Grand Alliance was given a seat, including East Champaran, despite the Congress' claim

 Ram temple case is pending in Supreme Court, so why need to increase it? 84 The Kosi Parikrama Yatra was decided on the occasion of Kumbh in the month of February
 usamen charchaa hui thi ki ram mandir kaa nirmaan sansad se hi hoga, yah ab court kaa vishay nahin rahaa
 Ramlala had also said that the child will become its law and everyone will support it
 kaha ja rahaa he ki 2014 ke chunaav or bijepi main modi ko aage badhaane ke liye viechpi aakraamak ho rahi he?yah puraa kaarykram santon kaa he
 With this movement, they are preparing huge manpower as Rambhaktas
 rambhakt aisi sarkaar chaahate hai jo ram janmabhumi mandir kaa nirmaan bhi kar sake
 If the Rama devotees believe that the BJP will benefit us, then who can stop the Rama devotees
 kya aapako ummid he ki modi ke netritv main agar sarkaar banati he to wo sansad main prastaav laaenge?kyon nahin karenge? meraa maananaa he ki bhagwaan ram kii shakti ke rup main jab bhagwaan ne unamem pravesh kiya he to vah unase kya-kya karaayenge to aap dekhte chaliye
 Travel not allowed
 ab aap kya karenge?jis din or jis padaav se yatra nikalni he vahaan par janata ikatthi hogi or padayatra karegi
 There was talk of stopping in Ayodhya, but the yatra is covered in five districts, where will we stop it
 har din 200 sant aaenge, santon ko rokane se ye pad yatra samaapt nahin hone vaali
 More than three thousand temples of Ayodhya are 80 percent dilapidated, why the VHP does not renovate them? The temples used to run Rajwada
 1947 main rajavaade khatm ho gaye
 After that it was the responsibility of the central government
 lekin usne hindu samaaj kii avhelnaa kii he, iske liye jimmedaar koun he?aapane kaha ki mulaayam-akhilesh se baatcheet main aapako nahin laga ki anumati nahin denge, to ab aap kisko jimmedaar maanate hai?ajam khan kaa vaktavy aayaa he ki mulaayam singh ko ashok singhl or santon se nahin milanaa chahie tha
 This has opened up and now Mulayam is overturned, Azam Khan is behind him and Mulayam Singh is running from Azam and Islamic dictate, wants to crush the spirit of Hindu society, want to suppress it
 ye unki aaj kii niti ajam khan ke kaaran se ban rahi he, aisa meraa maananaa he

 The list of bjp's promises topped the shutdown of animal slaughterhouses in the state along with loan waiver of farmers
 lekin khud bijepi ke bheetar bhi is baat ko lekar asamanjas he ki katlakhaanon ko band karne ke faisle par kaise amal hoga?kaise band honge masini katlakhaane?chunaav ke vakt jari bijepi ke sankalp patr ke tisare panne par avaidh or yantric katlakhaanon ko band karne kaa bharosa dilaayaa gaya he
 It is not a difficult task to shut down the abattoirs operating by ignoring the law but it will not be easy for the new government to lock the mechanical slaughterhouses running with the approval of the government
 kanoonee taur par vaid hai yantric katlakhaneupi ke kai jilon main masini katlakhaane hajaaron logon kii roji-roti kaa jariya hai
 Each of these works is done by machine
 aise katlakhaanon main bhens kaa maance taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Along with Maharashtra, UP is the largest meat export country in the country
 aisi ikaayiyon ke paas centre kaa license bhi hota he
 In such a situation, the question is whether despite the license, these slaughterhouses will be closed? Will any such decision survive in court? Action in Allahabad, although the Yogi government is trying to live up to this promise as soon as it takes power
 somvaar ko elahabaad nagar nigam ne shahar main chal rahe do avaidh katlakhaanon ko band karavaaya

 uttarakhand kii lokgayikacbutari devika kuch samay pehle hi nidhan hua he
 This is the third and last part of an article on his life struggle and singing
 pehle hisse main hamane dekha ki unke gayan main moort or amoort rup main pahaad ke jivan kaa chithran to dekhne ko miltaa he
 Along with the portrayal of nature in his songs, the subjects of mountain life, escape from the mountain, love, disconnection etc
 come to prominence
 (lekh kaa pehla hissaa padhane ke liye yahaan par clic karen)lekh ke duusare hisse main hamane dekha kiuttrakhandamen daliton kii kya saamaajik sthiti rahi he or vah lokkalaon, lokagayan kii kis parampara se aate hai
 Along with these aspects of Kabutari singing, the subject is debatable as to what extent the dalitlokagikas change their social environment and challenge the prevailing conditions
 (lekh ke duusare hisse ko padhane ke liye yahaan clic karen)is lekh shrinkhalaa ke tisare or aakhri hisse main ham unke jane ke baad uttarakhand main maujuuda lokagayan kii sthiti or samaksh vaishvikaran kii chunautiyon kaa jayja lenge
 Singing of Kabutari: People, folk and scripture do not remain untouched due to the excuse of singing of people, folk and scripture, and often comparing them to Bebegam Akhtaraya Teejan Bai
 uttarakhand ke ubharate rangakarmi or sahityakar dow
 Anil believes that Kabutari became the voice of the folk which is produced collectively with labor, not of scripture which is meant for pure entertainment by staying away from production
 vah kehete hai ki shaastra ke paas suron kaa anushaasan he to lok ke paas prakruti kaa anushaasan he
 If you listen blindly to the song 'pani Jaun' of Kabutari, you will also hear the noise of the Mahakali river, its sadness and peace, respectively, in the order of the song ascending and descending
 vah kehete hai ki loksangit main sashastitv kii dharaaen hoti hai
 Symbolism with nature, interaction with trees, plants, birds, sensitivity to the environment (ni kato-ni kato jhumrali baanj) will be found only in folk music and rural life
 girda ke janagit or kabutari ke loakgeeyuva ambedkarwaadi or marxvaadi adhyeta mohan aryaa kaa maananaa he ki uttarakhand kii lokkalaon main samaaj kaa saanskrithik varchasvvaad jhalkata he, isliye inke lop ko atirikt moh ke saath na dekhte hue samay ke pravaah ke saath dekha janaa chahie
 He says that the migration of Dalits or women is not seen in the famous song 'aaj Pani Jaun' of Kabootari
 saath hi vah maanate hai ki uttarakhand ke hi ek or janakavi or lokkalakaar girish tiwadi urf girda ke barakes kabutari ke geeton main dalit chetana ke swar nahin sunai dete jabaki girda apane karm se ek adarsh lok kii tasviir bhi pesh karte hai
 Mohan says that Girda's songs have a wider sociological perspective
 vah apni baat ko samajhane ke liye girda dwaara mashhoor shaayar faij ahamed faij kii ghazal ‘ham mehanatakash jab jagwaalon se apana hissaa maangenge, ek khet nahin-ek desh nahin-sari duniya maangenge‘ ko lisa shramikon ke andolan ke liye sthaneey bhashaa main roopantarit karke ‘ham od, barudi, kulli-kabadi, jain din yo duning tain hisaab lunlo, ek hong ni maangun, ek phang ni maangun, sari khasra-khatauni maangun’ jaisaa chetanasampann janagit banane kaa udhaaharan saamne rakhte hai
 Breaking Traditions Lokagayan, although Kabootari was only a singer, while Girda was a poet and singer
 isliye girda ke paas ‘kaisaa ho skool hamaara’, ‘ek taraf barbaad bastiyaan’, ‘jainta ek din to aalau din yo duni main’, ‘aaj himaal tumnakai dhatyuunchho’ jaise janagit hai jinamein rajya nirmaan, samaaj nirmaan, vaishvikaran kii chunautiyaan, shiksha niti, paryaavaran niti par chintaa jaise vividh vishay aate hai
 Fellow of Culture and Media, Dr
 bhupen kehete hai ki uttarakhand ke kai lokkalakaaron ne samaaj ko badalane kii sayas koshish kii he
 The hookadya (a drum-shaped hand-played instrument) that was once considered abusive, has many folklorists from the Savarna society, Devidutt Pant, Mohan Upreti (artist popularizing the Badu Pako Baramasa), Gauri Dutt Pandey alias Gaurda, Girish Tiwari aka Girda sang songs in the throats and carried forward the 'da' tradition i
e
 beyond the discrimination of caste, age, gender, these artists are for the people of all ages
 Used to be aadhunik samay main lok or shastralok or shaastra ke bich ke dwandv par bhupen kehete hai ki lok samaaj kaa praturup hota he jo kisi johnor main bandhaa nahin hota
 He has his own beauty
 samaaj ke vikaas ke saath-saath jab bhashaa or sangeet kaa vyakaran banataa he to shaastra paidaa hota he
 These two have been in contradiction for a long time
 shastreey gayan hameshaa aam logon kii pahunch main nahin rahaa he
 In the context of India, it has been in the possession of some gharanas or elite class, where only people belonging to caste were getting entry
 haa, nae media ke aane se fok or clasical ke bich kaa antar kam hua he
 Technological development and modernism have weakened the concepts of both
 isse sangeet sabhi ke liye sulabh hua he
 The challenge of the bulldozer of globalization in front of the folk Dr
 With the demise of the world, the decline of folk arts in the era of globalization and the challenges of consolidating different cultures
 anil kaa maananaa he ki pahachaanon ke sankat ke vaishvikaran ke daur main uttarakhand kaa lok kabutari kii aawaaj ko apni pahchaan bana saktaa he
 Anil says that solutions to any challenge of globalization will not be able to tell the cities settled only 500 years ago, to face those questions, we have to return to the two-and-a-half thousand years old rural life, ie the people of coexistence, the society which has now The capitalists have not succumbed to the imperatives
 isi chunauti ke sandarbh main mohan aryaa kehete hai ki vaishvikaran kaa muqabla vahi samaaj muqabla kar paaegaa, jisamen kam se kam antarvirodh honge, saanskrithik varchasvvaad kam hoga
 For this, he gives an example of tribal societies and some ethnic communities of Nagaland, how they are able to save their folk arts in this era with least contradictions
 ab lokagayan bazaar kii sharton parakabutari devi kaa gayan bhale hi girda kii tulana main janapakshdhar na rahaa ho, par unhone uttarakhand ke lok ko apni aawaaj di thi, lekin sthaneey bhashaaon kaa nayaa gayan niraashajanak he
 Bhupen says that in the folk life of Uttarakhand, dancing and singing were not considered respectable earlier
 yah kaam or lokkalaon ke vikaas kii jimmedaari dalit jatiyon ke kandhon par thi
 Later, with respect and money, the upper castes also came into this profession
 vah bataate hai ki uttarakhand ke nae gayakon main lok kaa tatv gaayab he
 Now with respect to this profession, the upper caste singers are also coming forward, but now they are singing only for the market and it is also promoting religious superstition
 haalanki, anil maanate hai ki abhi yah gayan mumbaiya bazaar tak pahunchane kii daud main duusari bhashaaon ke lokgeeton kii tarah bhrasht nahin hua he
 On the question of whether there will be a void in the field of folk art after the departure of the Lok Gaya Banagbutari, as the society would be, Girija Pandey says that there is never a vacuum in the society and things from different classes come and fill in the vacuum
 vah kehete hai ki shrota ke badalane ke saath hi gayak bhi badalata he
 If the listener is attaching himself to globalization and becoming prosperous, then the singer will also be affected by globalization
 yah to sambhav nahin he ki shrota dhanadya ho jaae, uski saanskrithik ruchi badal jaae or kalakaar usee garibi main rahe or puraane geet gaata rahe
 He also believes that if the public is to be saved, it will be the common responsibility of all, and at the same time society should appreciate the talent of its artist and also ensure his livelihood
 vah aage kehete hai ki vaishvikaran kii chunauti se nipatane ke liye saanskrithik dharoharon ko nae tareekon se sambhala ja saktaa he, unke saath prayog kiye ja sakate hai, kyonki puraane saamaajik parivesh or puraani vishvadrushti ko banaae rakhana sambhav nahin he
 Changing times and markets are also challenging for folk artists
 africa kaa sangeet europe main nae form main maujuud he
 He says that as standards of social and economic status are changing, even in weddings in Uttarakhand, djs will be played instead of Chholiya dance
 kabutari devi kaa sambhavit aakhri intervune rup main aa saktaa he lokagayanagirija pandey kehete hai ki takanic ne kalakaaron ko prayog karne ke avasar die hai or ab nai peedi ke haathon main he ki vah apni parampara ko kis disha main le jaati he
 Along with the new technology, the new economy has also broken the traditional form of folk art
 aaj kalakaar paisa or sammaan donon kama sakate hai
 He says that music changes according to the needs of society
 kshtakaari jivan khatm hone, kisaanon ke bacchon ke naukareepesha banane, prakruti ke saath jeevanyaapan na hone, band samaaj ke khulne, takanic kii madad se ek gane ke sab jagahon par pahunchane se geeton main puraani chijen chhot rahi hai or nai chijen saamne aa rahi hai
 He says that nostalgia is merely a desire to see folk as old
 sangeet bhi jivan kaa ek paksh he or vikaas yatra ke saath yah badalata rahata he
 Earlier instruments of animal horns and bamboo trunks were made which have now come from harmoniums to drums and trumpets
 sangeet main prayog ho rahe hai
 Coke Studios has introduced Faiz Ahmed Faiz's 'hum Dekhen' in a completely new style
 nepal ke yuva sangeet main abhinav prayog kar rahe hai
 He says that the space of the pigeon can not be filled with the same singing, because in recent times there is no demand for music like them
 agar aisa hota to vah antim samay tak vipannataa main na rahati

 PM Modi has answered questions on the issue of employment, economy, business and farmers
 padhein, saat muddon par piem ne kaise apni sarkaar kaa paksh rakhaa he
 1- Giving opportunity to corporate sector - Corporate sector can help in the development of India
 udhaaharan ke taur par krishi ke kshetra main korporate sector kii upasthiti kaaphi kam he
 We can make changes in this area
 raksha kshetra main bhartiya enterprise orepadiai kii jarurathai

 sarkaar ko maukey uplabdh karaane chahie
 For this, ease of doing business and red tape has been reduced

 Last year, more than 7 million jobs have been created and poverty has also decreased, but was it possible without creating jobs

 If you look closely at the policies of the government, then steps have been taken to help the farmers from seed to market

 100 fisadi hindu bachche padhate he urdu, bana garibi dur karne kaa jariyagaav waalon ne sarkaar se kiya sanskrit hataakar urdu padhaane kaa anurodhbanaras hindu vishvavidhyalay main professor firoz khan ke virodh ke baad bhashaa or dharm ko lekar sawaal uthne lage hai
 But those raising questions should come to Sidra village, about 100 km from Jaipur
 yahaan ke 100 fisadi hindu bachche ji jaan se urdu padhate hai or urdu ke badaulat hi is gaanv ne garibi par kaabo paaya he
 The villagers here have chosen Urdu by removing the Sanskrit theme
 kahaan he ye gaanvajaipur se 100 kilometre dur kachi sadak ke jariye tonk jile main sidada gaanv basaa hua he
 In the village 96 percent of the Meena Samaj tribe is Abadi
 yahaan ke sarkari skool main bacchon kii bheed lagi rahati he
 The reason for this is the provision of government Urdu teachers here
 dur-dur tak koi alpsankhyak abaadi nahin he lekin puraa gaanv urdu kii padhai main laga he
 The study of Urdu by removing Sanskrit is said that three years ago, at the request of the villagers, they will learn to teach Urdu by removing Sanskrit
 isaki vajah bhi khaas he
 Urdu has changed the fate of this Sidda village with a mere 2500 people
 urdu padhanaa rojgaar kii guarantee ban gaya he
 In almost every household in the village, one person got a government job due to Urdu
 is gaanv main har ek baccha bade chaav se urdu padhate hai
 Even more special is that most of them are girls
 aise hi seemaa nayak 12veen class main padhati hai
 Mir Taki narrating the Lion of Mir tells how lovely this language is and we want to read it and become a lecturer
 guddi meena 11veen class kii chaatra he or kahati hai ki hamane ghar par bhi urdu padhane ke liye tution kar rakhaa he or hamaare mata-pita bhi urdu padhane main hamaari madad karte hai
 Earlier Sanskrit was taught in this government school, but now all the children of the village have chosen Urdu instead of Sanskrit as an optional subject after twelfth
 bacchon ke urdu padhane kii aisi lalak he ki inhen extra classes kerani padati he
 The problem is that in the schools of minority Abadi, the government arranges for the teaching of Urdu in the primary, due to which these children are not getting to read Urdu in childhood
 sirf gyarahavin-barahavin main urdu padhane ko mil rahaa he jisaki vajah se bahut zyada mehnat kerani padati he
 He wants him to study Urdu from primary school
 urdu bani bharan poshan kii bhashabirbal meena rajkeey ucch vidhyalay main pradhanadhyaapak hai
 He says that Urdu has become the language of maintenance in this village, so no one in this village sees it from the perspective of any sect
 gaanv ke logon kaa kahana he ki urdu kisi kaum yaa desh kii bhashaa nahin lagati he
 It is very sweet language and is also giving us a job
 urdu kii anusuchit janajati kii siten khaali rah jaati thi lekin ye gaanv akele in siton ko bharne laga he
 Prithviraj Meena, the daughter of a guardian, studies in this school and he says that the language has nothing to do with any sect or religion
 bhashaa to vyakti ko pyaari lagani chahie or uske jivan yaapan kaa saadhan hona chahie
 Yogesh Meena is a direct resident of 'urdu studies should be arranged from sixth class'
 unka kahana he ki hamane sarkaar se maang kii he
 Urdu should be arranged in this school from Class VI because the government does not have rules that Urdu teachers should be placed in a primary school in a Hindu dominated area
 ham sarkaar se lagaataar niyam badalane kii maang kar rahe hai
 More than 100 people have been employed in the Department of Medical, Language, Education and Social Welfare in the village so far
 dur-daraaj ke is gaanv main berogari samasya bani to anusuchit janajati kii abaadi vaale gaanv ne naukari paane kaa aisa rambaan nikaala ki isane puure gaanv kii tasviir badal di
 Six years ago, a man from the village got his eye on a government job recruitment
 jisamen urdu jaanane vaale naukariyon main anusuchit janajati kii siten khaali rah jaati thi
 He learned Urdu by going to the city and got a lecturer's job
 uske baad to jaise urdu hi gaanv kii jindagi ban gai
 The way these children are studying Urdu, they say that Sendra village alone will compete on all the vacancies of Urdu
 pehle gaanv main behad garibi thi lekin urdu gaanv main bhi khushhaali lekar ai he

 Satyagraha film director Prakash Jha and lead actor Amitabh Bachchan spoke to deputy editor Kunal Pradhan about how the lack of political films in India is associated with growing intolerance and overcrowding in the country

 India Today, is this not a self imposed thing? Can the industry not tell political parties that it is not their job to censor content? Amitabh Bachchan i must not say this, but i would say that people in India have become so sensitive that even the smallest thing gets them snubbed
 unhen lagata he ki chunki yah samvedansheel mudda he, isliye is par bolne se unhen shoharat mil jaaegi
 Sometimes political parties raise such issues

 99 crore people in India have an Aadhaar card
 aapmen se bahut log aadhaar kaa istemaal alag-alag madon main karte bhi honge
 Do you remember what was recorded about your identity when Aadhaar was created and what could happen to that record
 zarur ham yaa aap aadhaar card par die gaye number kaa istemaal anya dastavezon ke vikalp ke rup main karne lagate hai
 IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad says that no foreign agency is involved in the data collected on Aadhaar
 jo bhi data he wo videsh main nahin balki bharat ke bengaluru or manesar main surakshit rakhaa gaya he
 Remember what you were asked for while making Aadhaar card
 ek form bharaa hoga aapane, jisamen apana naam, mata-pita kaa naam, ling, umr, janm tithi, gaanv, zila se lekar rajya tak kii jaankaree deni hoti he
 You fill in the email, mobile number and PIN code in the form
 mata-pita yaa pati yaa patni kaa aadhaar number bhi aapke aadhaar ke form main hota he
 Proof of date of birth has to be given
 pahchaan or pate kaa pramaan bhi dena hota he
 One has to give one out of 18 proofs for identification and 33 proofs for permanent address
 jaise rashan card, passport, driving license, matadaata pahchaan patr dene se pahchaan or pataa donon kaa kaam ho jaataa he
 Three months bill of water-electricity or telephone will be given for permanent address
 jab aap aadhaar card kii mashin ke saamne jate honge to aapaki sabhi ungaliyon ke nishaan liye gaye honge
 The pupil of the eye must have been scanned and photographed
 itani jaankaree jamaa karne ke baad aapako aadhaar number miltaa he
 With that number, anyone can know who you are, what religion they are, where they live and how they look
 iske alaava aavedan form main bank khate kaa number bhi dena hota he
 In the Aadhar form, the number of the National Population Register survey is also to be given where this information is recorded about which religion, caste, language you speak
 aapaki aamadani kya he
 Aadhaar card of five to seven lakh people is created every day in India
 bharat sarkaar ne haal hi main loksabhaa main mani bill ke rup main aadhaar, Targeted Delivery of Financial and other subsidies, Benefits and services Bill 2016 bill pesh kiya or paas kara liya
 The government has given it a legal form
 vitt mantri jetali ne sadan main kaha ki is bill kaa makasad itnaa he ki sabsidi kaa paisa kise mil rahaa he
 Whoever is getting it deserves it or not
 vitt mantri ne apana udhaaharan diya ki jab ve apni car ke liye deazal karidate hai to unhen sabsidi milti he jabaki nahin milani chahie
 There is also a debate that diesel car sales increase because diesel subsidies are cheaper
 ab vitt mantri ke udhaaharan se saaf nahin hua ki kya aadhaar card ke istemaal se sarkaar yah sunishchit karegi ki deazal kii sabsidi sirf kisaan ko hi mili
 Do not get the big car
 kisaanon ko aadhaar card ke zariye alag dar par deazal diya ja saktaa he
 Since the example of diesel was given, all these thoughts came to mind
 vitt mantri ne apane bhaashan main is baat par baar-baar jor diya ki ham sansadhano kii bachat kar adhik se adhik zaruuratmandon tak sabsidi ke laabh ko pahunchaana chaahate hai
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said in the Rajya Sabha that there was a saving of 1500 crore through direct benefit transfer and 2346 crore in public distribution system
 pichley oktober main supreme court ne janvitaran pranali ke alaava manaregaa, pension yojana or ipief ko bhi aadhaar ke daayre main laa diya tha
 Then the court had said that Aadhaar should be optional in public welfare schemes
 antim faisla aane tak anivaary nahin kiya janaa chahie
 It is to be decided in the Supreme Court that no one can interfere in your privacy or privacy by acquiring the Aadhaar card
 loksabhaa main vitt mantri ne yahi kaha ki maamla supreme court main he isliye niztaa ke sawaal se kinaaraa karte hai lekin aadhaar card ke data ko lekar jo ashanka jataai ja rahi he uske bare main jawaab dena chaahate hai
 The Finance Minister said that Chapter VI of the bill contains provisions to keep information secret and secure
 kaise surakshit rakhaa jayega isaki prakriya tay kii gai he
 Under Section 8, some data can be shared at the will of an individual but biometric data ie pupil or fingerprints will not be shared with consent
 section 29 kahata he ki kor biometric data kisi se saajha nahin kiya jayega
 Whether or not there is a difference between biometric data and core biometric data, i have little information in this matter
 marzi se jo data saajha kiya ja saktaa he wo kya he or kiske saath saajha kiya ja saktaa he
 If the data is shared by will, the process will be decided between the person and the state or someone will take information from you or the state instead of us
 jaise kisi company ne aapse sahmati le lee or rajya se wo data le liya
 We will also talk whether it will harm you or not
 vitt mantri ne yah zarur kaha ki adaalat agar data maang de to ham uski shakti ko simit nahin kar sakate hai
 According to this bill, any judge above a district judge can ask for data
 rashtriya suraksha ke liye agar koi soochna kisi khaas uddeshy ke liye saajha kii jaani he to wo faisla sanyukt sachiv str kaa koi adhikari karegaa
 There will be a committee headed by the Cabinet Secretary to review every decision
 ek taraf court duusari taraf joint secetry kaa faisla
 Is it safe or else what are the risks? sarkaar ke paas tarah tarah ke ricard ke rup main aapaki jaankaree to hoti hi he
 If they want, they can also take your information from those documents
 jaise passport kii jaankaree saajha karne se aapaki hamaari privesi kaa ulanghan hota he ise bhi samaj lene main koi buraai nahin he
 The Finance Minister has said one thing that even if a private agency takes the Aadhaar number, it will not leak it
 ye usase ummid kii jaati he yaa wo nahin kar paaegi iske liye sakht praavdhaan he
 PRS Legislative Research, while studying this bill, has asked what is the point of giving Aadhaar data to a private agency if the purpose of the bill is only to get the subsidy to the right people
 tippaniyan Chapter 7 of the bill states that to provide subsidy, his identity under Aadhaar will need to be confirmed
 iskaa pramaan dena hoga ki aadhaar card aapkaa hi he
 Chapter 57 states that any public or private person can use the Aadhaar number to confirm the identity of the person
 samajhane kaa prayaas karenge ki aadhaar number antim pahchaan he yaa aadhaar number dene ke baad bhi uskaa veriphication hota rahegaa
 PRS Legislative says that this provision allows telecom, airlines or insurance companies to ask you for an Aadhaar number
 ham apane mehmaan se puuchhenge ki isse hamaara aapkaa kya nuksaan he
 The PRS has raised the question of profile
 jaise agar aadhaar card ke number se yah pataa laga liya jaae ki aapane kahaan kahaan vimaan yatra kii, phone kaa record mil jaae to kya nuksaan hoga
 All these information are called profiles
 jaise soshal media par aapane dekha hoga
 If you are a girl, then only advertisements for products related to girls start appearing on your page
 ladkaa hai to vigyaapan badal jaataa he
 Due to your search pattern, the news feed on your page also starts to match the same
 yah sab profile se sambhav hota he
 If all this starts happening from Aadhaar then what will be its danger
 close 47(1) main kaha gaya he ki is act ke tahat koi aparaadh hua to court uskaa sangyaan nahin le saktaa
 Unless the UID authority complains or authorizes anyone to complain
 piares kaa kahana he ki is praavdhaan se to yahi lagata he ki aap ek vyakti ke rup main sidhe court ja hi nahin sakate
 If the government is so confident in its security system then why does it not give any citizen the right to go to court directly
 is kanoon main data kii suraksha kaa daayitv yuaidi athurity ke paas he
 If the same employee has defaulted, how can the common citizen expect justice from the same authority
 kya is bare main koi spashtataa he
 If the data was stolen or shared with someone, then they will know everything about you
 kya aap apni sari jaankaree kisi se bhi saajha karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 If the purpose of the Aadhaar law is to make subsidies only to the needy, then why are those who do not take subsidies included in its purview
 alpiji kaa udhaaharan diya gaya ki amir log bhi sabsidi le rahe the lekin kya yah paryaapt udhaaharan he

 The Finance Minister repeatedly emphasized in his speech that we want to extend the benefit of subsidy to more and more needy by saving resources
 ravishankar prasad ne rajya sabha main kaha ki diarect benifit transfar ke zariye 1500 karod or janvitaran pranali main 2346 karod kii bachat hui he
 Last October, in addition to the public distribution system, the Supreme Court also brought MNREGA, pension scheme and EPF under the ambit of Aadhaar
 tab court ne yahi kaha tha ki lokkalyankari yojanaon main aadhaar vaikalpik hona chahie
 It should not be made mandatory until the final verdict comes
 supreme court main is baat par faisla hona he ki aadhaar card hasil kar aapaki hamaari niztaa yani privesi main koi dakhal to nahin de saktaa he
 In the Lok Sabha, the Finance Minister said that the matter is in the Supreme Court, so we avoid the question of privacy but want to answer about the apprehension being raised about the data of Aadhaar card
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki bill ke chapter VI main soochnaaon ko gupt or surakshit rakhane ke praavdhaan hai
 The process of how to be protected has been fixed
 section 8 ke tahat kuch data kisi vyakti kii marzi se saajha kiye ja sakate hai lekin bayemetric data yani ankhon kii putali yaa ungaliyon ke nishaan sahmati se bhi saajha nahin kiye jaaenge
 Section 29 states that core biometric data will not be shared with anyone
 bayemetric data or kor biometric data main koi fark he yaa nahin, meri is maamle main kam jaankaree he
 What is the data that can be shared by will and with whom it can be shared
 marzi se data share kiya jayega to wo prakriya vyakti or rajya ke bich tay hogi yaa koi aapke yaa hamaare badale rajya se jaankaree le legaa
 For example, some company took consent from you and took that data from the state
 ham baat bhi karenge ki isse aapkaa nuksaan hoga yaa nahin
 The Finance Minister definitely said that we cannot limit its power if the court demands the data
 is bill ke anusaar zila jaj se upar kaa koi bhi jaj data maang saktaa he
 If any information is to be shared for a particular purpose for national security, then that decision will be taken by an officer at the level of Joint Secretary
 cabinet sachiv kii adhyakshata main ek cameti hogi jo har faisle kii samiksha karegi
 The court on one side decides the joint secretary on the other side
 kya yah surakshit he or nahin to iske khatare kya ho sakate hai
 The government has your information in the form of various records
 wo chaahe to un dastavezon se bhi aapaki jaankaree le sakati he
 Just as sharing passport information violates our privacy, there is no harm in understanding it
 vitt mantri ne ek baat kahi he ki agar koi privet agency aadhaar number le bhi le to wo ise li nahin karegi
 There is a strict provision for this that is expected from him or he will not be able to do it
 piares legislative research ne is bill kaa adhyayan karte hue sawaal kiya he ki agar bill kaa makasad sirf sabsidi ko sahi logon tak pahunchaana he to phir privet agency ko aadhaar kaa data dene kaa kya matlab he
 The comments bill ke chapter 7 main kaha gaya he ki sabsidi dene ke liye aadhaar ke tahat uski pahchaan kii pushti kii zarurat padegi
 It has to be given proof that the Aadhaar card is yours
 chapter 57 main kaha gaya he ki koi bhi public yaa privet vyakti aadhaar number kaa istemaal kar saktaa he taaki wo us vyakti kii pahchaan kii pushti kar sake
 We will try to understand whether the Aadhaar number is the last identity or even after giving the Aadhaar number, its verification will continue
 piares legislative kaa kahana he ki is praavdhaan se telecom, airlines yaa beemaa companiyaan aapse aadhaar number maang sakati hai
 We will ask our guest what is your loss to us
 piares ne profile kaa sawaal uthaaya he
 For example, if the Aadhar card number is found out where you have traveled, what is the loss, if you get the phone records
 inhen sab jaankaree ko profile kaha jaataa he
 Like you might have seen on social media
 agar aap ladki hai to aapke pej par ladakiyon se sambandhit utpaadon ke hi vigyaapan aane lagate hai
 If the boy is, then the advertisement changes
 aapke search karne ke pattern se aapke pej par news feed bhi usee se miltaa julata aane lagata he
 All this is possible with profiles
 agar aadhaar se yah sab hone lage to uske kya khatre honge
 Clause 47 (1) states that a court cannot take cognizance of a crime under this Act
 jab tak ki you ai di athurity shikaayat na kare yaa wo kisi ko shikaayat karne ke liye adhikrut na kare
 The PRS says that with this provision it seems that you as a person cannot go to court directly
 agar sarkaar ko apni suraksha vyavastha par itnaa hi bharosa he to wo kisi naagarik ko sidhe court jane kaa adhikaar kyon nahin detii he
 The UID Authority is responsible for protecting data in this law
 agar usee ke karmchaaree se chook ho gai to aam naagarik usee athurity se insaaf kii ummid kaise kar saktaa he
 Is there any clarity on this? agar data chori hua yaa kisi se saajha kar liya gaya to wo aapke bare main har chiz jaan jayega
 Are you ready to share all your information with anyone
 agar aadhaar kanoon kaa makasad sirf sabsidi ko zaruuratmand tak pahunchaana he to iske daayre main unhen kyon shaamil kiya gaya jo sabsidi nahin lete hai
 The example of LPG was given that rich people were also taking subsidies but is this an adequate example
