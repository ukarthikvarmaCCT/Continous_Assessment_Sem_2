 Two policemen beat up a bus conductor at a Kashmiri Gate interstate bus base in Delhi for refusing to carry any luggage in a bus
 police waalon ne use belt se peeta
 After this incident, conductors and bus drivers of all buses coming from Kashmiri Gate took to the streets in protest

 The beating of the conductor by the belt
 This incident is at seven o'clock on Wednesday morning
 do pulisavaalon ne kashmiri get se bhivani jane vaali ek bas ko roak kar ek parcel conductor ko dekar use bhivani main kisi ko dene ke liye kaha
 But according to the rules, the conductor refused to take the parcel without a passenger

 Not only did the protest strike when the victim conductor called the police on the number 100 after the incident, the conductor and driver were also beaten by taking them to the police post

 is hafte dimag par chaaya sabase bada mudda salmaan khan kaa he
 Whether Parliament should pass the LBA (on Bangladesh border dispute) or GST Bills in this session
 chaahe sonia gandhi, rahul or yahaan tak ki narendra modi bhi bahes main jabardast hastkshep karen
 Whatever it may be, none of this is worth the attraction that Salman Khan has in the sentence of five years imprisonment
 is hafte kii kahani salmaan khan hi hai jinhone apni chamak-damak se moga bas cond or aap ke 'acand' main shaamil badal parivaar or kumaar vishwaas kii surkhiyon ko feekaa kar diya he
 The question arises that what can a columnist say about Salman that has not been said so far? For this i would have to resort to my elderly professor of strategic studies, Stephen Cohen (who is currently at the Brookings Institution in Washington), who told a story about an aspiring young novelist
 kahani yon he ki vah yuvak saphaltam prakashkon ke chakkar lagaakar poochta phirata he ki upanyaas likhane ke liye sabase zyada bikaoo vishay kya hoga
 One responds to Abraham Lincoln, the other says doctor, while the third publisher advises dogs to write novels
 iske baad vah yuvak abraham linkan ke doctor ke kute par apni kahani rachataa he
 Let us apply this principle of Cohen to the story of Salman
 yah kahani sharaab ke nashe main dhut ek superstar, ek esayuvi, footpath or kuch sadakchhaap logon ke bare main he jo us footpath par apni raat bitaate hai
 We can say that my argument for this week has three themes - Salman Khan's SUV, sidewalk and some poor people sleeping on it
 or haa, main in logon ke liye gayak abhijit ke shabdon ko vyangy main bhi istemaal nahin karuunga
 i and my family love dogs so much, so whether it is slander or satire, i do not want to give so much attention to Abhijeet
 vaise, usne kaha to thik hi tha
 Sanjay Khan's daughter, Feroz Khan's niece, Hrithik Roshan's sister-in-law, celebrity DJ Akeel's wife, famous jewelery designer and Farah Ali Khan with more than five million Twitter followers also rightly said
 aap unke shabdon ke chayan par jarur bahes kar sakate hai jo unhone 'stupid, suicide' logon (is mudde par kisi bhi morrkhtaa se bachane ke liye main in shabdon kaa istemaal kar rahaa hum) ke liye istemaal kiya
 One chose the 'death of the dog' in the salim-javed style of the seventies, the other showed a more realistic view of Mumbai where many people illegally crushed and died while crossing the railway tracks
 
 donon kaa sawaal haalanki ek hi tha aakhir ye log footpath par avaidh so hi kyon rahe the jabaki esayuvi ke avishkaar se dashakon pehle munisipolity kii banavaai us sankari sadak se kahin zyada jagah akele salmaan khan ko chahie thi? mumbaiya lahaze main bole to, "thodaa to margin chhodie kaa he na, bhai ke liye
 If you want to die then you should come in the way Stuck in the mind, it keeps doing its work slowly even in those times when the idea of 140-character tweet has passed
 jaahir he, mere jehan main yah footpath atka hua he
 After all, whose is this and why? Do the rich also have the right to encroach upon it first because of their clout? The real question is because this is the response of the Bollywood elite who have offended us
 bollywood ke buudhe-puraane log aise muddon par kuch nahin bolte, isaki hamen ab tak aadat pad chuki he
 Be it Delhi gang rapes, bmw's Sanjeev Nanda's case, Jessica Lal's murder case or Mumbai's Alistair Perera's case, they will turn red-yellow on all these, but when the matter is of a film family member, So you can understand the reason for their silence
 jahaan tak is duniya ke kam taqatvar yuvaaon kaa sawaal he, to balaatkaar ke aaropee shaini ahuja jaise maamuli abhinayta ke liye bhi unki najar vishesh vidhaan kii maang karti he
 However, in the case of Salman, where the big actors kept quiet, some medium people came to their rescue and started playing suicidal games from social media to TV channels
 shaayad ve yah maanakar chal rahe honge ki salmaan jaldi hi waapas aa jayega yaa phir vah hameshaa ke liye jamaanat par baahar he or is ehsaan ke badale unka bhi kuch bhala kar de
 Frankly speaking, i kept searching for hours and then i got to see the only mature comment from Bollywood which was of talented actress Nimrat Kaur (the Lunchbox)
 baaki ke liye yah mudda bahut aasaan thah vah yah, ki sadaken gadipoon ke liye bani hai isliye logon ko un par tahalnaa yaa sona nahin chahie
 The most sincere comment came from singer Abhijeet who asked what this pavement is
 kya aap jaanate hai ki bhartiya sadakon par bamushkil hi koi footpath hota he
 Even if it happens, it is so low and half-finished that it is difficult to distinguish it from the road
 khaskar tab, jab aapaki dhamniyon main testosterone or sharaab kii maarak bijli daud rahi ho (aakhri vaakya meraa he, abhijit kaa nahin)
 Bollywood, in its idiosyncratic performance, rightly reminded us of an issue that we left behind
 hamaare gharon or imaaraton ke saamne kii sadak, footpath, khaali jagahen aakhir kiski hai? chunki ham kar chukaate hai, mahangi kaaren chalaate hai, aaleeshaan makaanon main rahete hai, to kya sirf isiilie in saarvajanik jagahon par kabja karnaa hamaara adhikaar ho jaataa he? kya paidal chalane waalon ke liye koi jagah chodi jaaegi? raat ke un musafiron ke liye bhi jinke sir par chat nahin he? bollywood main adhiktar nai khandaani peedi aisa hi maanati he kyonki beete jamaane ke devanand, dharmendra, amitabh bachchan kii tarah unhone footpath par sangharsh nahin kiya he
 This is the SUV generation born amidst a raft of high-profile contacts with cash in their pockets to carry their publicity to the city's newspapers
 vaise, ham log bhi koi khaas behatar nahin hai jo top speed par gaadi chalaate hue paidal chalane vaale adane logon par chhinta maarthe jate hai, atikaraman karne vaale khokhe-khomachon ko koste hai jabaki hamaare gharon ke aage kii sari khaali jagah hamaari gadibhan leel jaati hai jiske badale main ham ek paisa nahin chukaate
 India has been witness to a spurt in the automobile sector in the post-maruti era, but in the same period a sense of devotion to non-car owners has also been seen
 jaisaa abhijit kehete hai, hamaare liye footpath jaisi koi cheez nahin he kyonki ham ek daravaaje se duusare daravaaje ke bich gaadi chalaate aae hai
 In this case, Delhi is far worse than Mumbai
 hamane das arab dollar kii metro chalaa di lekin un logon ke liye saadhaaran se footpath tak nahin bana paae jinke ghar stesan ke kareeb hai taaki ve paidal chalakar vahaan pahunch saken
 i realized this when one Diwali evening i boarded the metro to go home excitedly
 stesan se apane ghar tak 600 meter kii duuri tay karnaa bahut bhayaavah anubhav tha
 In any other city that values people's self-respect, this distance would have been happily just five minutes
 kisi bade shahar ke liye footpath utane hi ahm hai jitani uski skyline
 Think about a walk in Hollywood
 mumbai main to khaskar footpath itihaas, samskruti or lokkathaon kaa hissaa rahe hai
 i remember once interviewing Amitabh Bachchan on TV when he started it from a bench in front of Marine Drive
 yahi vah bench thi jahaan bombai main kaam khojate vakt unhone kuch raaten guzari thim
 In the voice of Mukesh, search for the great class song on youtube and play, "china-o-arab ours, Hindostan ours, stay home, Sara jahan hamara
" " is gane main sara jahaan kaa matlab footpath se hi he or yah geet footpaathon ke sabase pyaare khanaabadosh raaj kapur par filmaaya gaya he (1958 kii phir subah hogi)
 While listening to these words of Sahir Ludhianvi, it seems that Goya's mind is slowly peeling off the stuck beliefs, "all the buildings were distributed by the Seths, the footpaths of Bombay are ours
 
 
 "mumbai samet hamaare tamaam shaharon main yah tasviir aaj badal chuki he
 Abhijeet, Farah and others like him are right
 kisi bhi insaan ko raat main footpath par nahin sona chahie, lekin agar koi sota he to kya ek esayuvi ko use kuchalane kaa adhikaar mil jaataa he? bhale hi use sharaab ke nashe main dhut koi mahanayake hi kyon na chalaa rahaa ho?main garibon ke paksh main koi daleel nahin de rahaa
 My complaint is not even that Bollywood has reached here in its development, today India has embraced the whimsical new cities of India or, say, nri-borne prosperity
 vaise, meraa maananaa he ki yah prakriya pehali baar dil chahta he (farhaan akhtar nirdeshit pehali film, 2001) se shuru hui thi
 It is true that the poor have been forgotten
 barason ho gaye jab hamane 'baaki' logon ke bare main koi film dekhi thi
 My emphasis however is on citizenship perception, civilization and spontaneous modern urban life
 duniya ke tamaam viksit hisse main paidal yatriyon ke liye sadakon ko dobaaraa hasil kiya ja rahaa he
 We are busy reversing it
 isiilie salmaan kii kahani bhale hi unke staradam, esayuvi, sharabkhori or badakismat sadakchhaap logon ke bare main he lekin yah footpaathon ke bare main bhi he jise saajha karnaa sabake haq main he, chaahe uske paas kitna hi paisa or staradam kyon na ho
 PS: Taking a break from this magazine in late 1993, i went to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in London, where my friend from the Economist called me for his weekly meeting
 america main o
 J
 simpasan kii khabar tab surkhiyon main thi
 The question at the meeting was what should an ideological weekly magazine write about the subject when one of its editors himself commented, "OJ is a tremendous handsome, is overwhelmingly black and is also tremendously guilty?" Just apply this comment on Salman
 tab aapako yah masalaa kuch or saaf samaj main aayega
 After all, how can the law written for the common people apply to it? What is the benefit of rotting him in jail when the victim's family does not get anything from him? From here, the idea is to give a lot of money to the victim, though it is tribal thinking

 aamtaur par beemaa companiyaan is tarah ke maamle main clem dene se inkaar karti he
 Justice VK Jain pronounced the judgment in this case, saying that since the mosquito bite was sudden (accidental), due to this, death due to mosquito bite disease should also be considered as an accident

 The Central Government, which came under vigil after allegations of corruption at the Commonwealth Games, promised that strict action will be taken against those found guilty
 is bich aktubar main hone vaale in khelon ke ek anya stadium kaa udghaatan kar diya gaya haalanki uski chat bhi tapak rahi thi
 Union Urban Development Minister s Jaipal Reddy assured action against the culprits on the report of the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC)
 sivisi ne rashtramandal khelon ke stadimon ke nirmaan main bade paimaane par bhrashtachar kii report di thi
 Reddy said during the inauguration of the weightlifting auditorium inside the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium complex that the Central Vigilance Commission in the initial report had allegedly found irregularities in the construction of Commonwealth Games venues
 main aapako aashwast karnaa chahta hum ki isse sambandhit sabhi doshiyon ko sajaa di jaayegi or koi bhi bakhsha nahin jaayegaa
 He said that we are taking this matter seriously
 khelon kii aayojan samiti ke adhyaksh suresh kalmari ne shanivaar ko vittiya aniyamittaaon ke aaropon kaa ek ghante tak samvaadadaata sammelan main khandan kiya lekin unhone bhi ravivaar ko phir se spashtikaran jari kiya
 Kalmadi again said that the name of the British company that was at the center of the corruption controversy was recommended by the Indian High Commission in London
 bhartiya ucchayog ne haalanki alpagyaat british company e em films kii sifarish karne se inkaar kiya he, jis par kathith rup se landan main queens beton riley ke dauraan apni sevaayen dene ke liye lakhon pound lene kaa aarope he
 Kalmadi rejected the High Commission's refusal claim, saying the recommendation was made by the Embassy of India courtesy officer Raju Sebastian
 unhone is sambandh main aayojan samiti or ucchayog ke patron ko bhi pesh kiya he
 However, according to media reports, Raju is quite a junior officer to make any kind of recommendation like the High Commission
 kalmari ne kaha ki aayojan samiti yah saaf karnaa chaahati he ki hamane bhartiya ucchayog ke pratham sachiv (shishtachar) mistar vikrant ratan ko parivahan, awaas or anya sevaaon ke liye agenciyon kii suchi unki anumodith daron ke saath uplabdh karaane ke liye likhaa tha
 He said that in response to this, Raju Sebastian of the courtesy department of the High Commission of India had given the information of the name of AM Car and Van and Schaufer Company as an approved vendor for transportation, citing our mail written to First Secretary Vikrant Ratan
 
 unhone kaha ki kisi bhi stadium ke dizin main kisi tarah kii gambhir kharabi nahin he, kisi bhi stadium kii chat main koi kharabi nahin he
 The truth is that there is no disturbance in the stadium nor is water dripping from any roof
 kisi bhi bade toornament kii ahmiyat ko kam mat karo
 All these claims open from the view inside and outside the auditorium
 isse pataa chalata he ki desh kii rajdhani teen se 14 aktubar ke bich hone vaale rashtramandal khelon ke liye kitni taiyaar he
 One can see cracks in VIP lounges and sealing of the warm-up area by going inside this auditorium costing a total of 80 crores
 isse pataa chalata he ki aditorium ko samaysima par aayojan samiti ko saunpane ke liye kitni jaldbaaji main kaam karke gunvattta se khilwaad kiya gaya

 Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has accused Bharatiya Janata Party national president Nitin Gadkari and former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje of instigating the Gurjar agitation
 gahalot ne kaha, ‘bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh gadakari or vasundhara raaje chaahate hai ki jagah-jagah aag lage, raste jam hon, rail patariyon par log baithen, main isaki ninda karata hum
 He said that during the previous BJP government, there was a movement of Gurjar society but the Congress leaders did not give vent to the movement
 hamane us vakt bhi kaha tha ki sanvaidhanik prakriya ke tahat hi kisi ko aarakshan mil saktaa he
 Gehlot said that i regret that the leaders of that party, which in themselves are called the National Party (BJP), have such a narrow thinking that whether there is firing, violence, confrontation, whatever, but within democracy The movement should not end with peace
 unhone kaha ki bhartiya janata party andolan bhadakaane kaa kaam karti he uski desh main aag lagane kii fitrat he jabaki congress ke netaaon ne aag bujhane kaa kaam kiya he
 Gehlot said that the BJP should have appealed to Colonel Kirodi Singh Bainsla to end the movement but it is not doing so to give more momentum to the movement
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki vah gurjar samaaj ke tamaam logon se phir apil karnaa chahenge ki chaahe vah kisi bhi raajnneetik party ke log ho, aandolan rajya ke hit main nahin he ,is aandolan ko sheeghra samaapt kare
 At the same time, Gurjar agitators blocked the jaipur-mumbai rail route near Vanasthali in Tonk district
 police or railway sutron ne bataaya ki andolankariyon dwaara vanasthali ke nikat rail trek par kabja kar liye jane ke kaaran savai madhopur rail maarg par bhi yatayaat thap ho gaya he
 He said that efforts are being made to operate the trains originating from this route at present
 aandolankariyon dwaara jaipur-mumbai rail maarg par kabja kar lene ke baad jaipur kaa sampark dilli, agra, udaipur or mumbai se puri tarah cat gaya he
 It is worth mentioning that before the Gurjar agitation, jaipur-delhi rail route near Bandikui, delhi-mumbai rail route at Chhokra rail gate in Bharatpur district, ajmer-udaipur rail route near Model in Bhilwara district already occupied this route
 But rail traffic is at a standstill

 Such a height, which can stain the water, such a height which can fill the inferiority of the house, is an official of acclamation, is an invitation to the ascension, flags can be built on it, but no sparrow can make a needle there, nor can anyone get tired -manda Batohi, can blink in his shade for a second

 The height and depth are the distance of the sky
 jo jitna ooncha,utana ekaaki hota he,har bhaar ko swayan dhota he,chehre par muskaane chipka,man hi man rota he
 It is important that there should be an expansion with height, so that humans do not stand like stump, get mixed up with others, take someone along, walk with someone
 bheed main kho janaa,yaadon main dub janaa,swayan ko bhul janaa,astitv ko arth,jivan ko sugandh detaa he
 The earth needs humans of high stature, not dwarfs

 In this order, he named Yashwant Sinha, Jaswant Singh and Sushma Swaraj
 unhone kaha ki afsos hota he ki itane guni log hai, jinhen darkinar kiya gaya, jo acchhee baat nahin he
 Why Modi is also Shivraj
 Taking a fresh look at Advani's voice, Sinha said that the capable and popular Chief Minister in the party is not only Narendra Modi of Gujarat
 shivaraj singh chouhan bhi isamen shaamil hai
 After that, Sinha lightened the tone and said that i am a disciplined person, so i cannot encroach the realm
 main modi kaa mitra or samarthakaaj tak se khaas baatcheet ke ant main shatrughna sinha bole ki main narendra modi kaa mitra bhi hum or samarthak bhi

 Darul Uloom Deoband is issuing a fatwa on the one hand that Muslims should avoid marrying bank employees, because there is a job in Sud and it is unfair according to Islam
 duusari taraf desh main islamic banking ke khaaton main logon kii dilchaspee hi nahin paidaa ho rahi he
 The ongoing Islamic banking facility in the country seems to be a flop at the moment
 maharashtra ke sholapur main lokmagal ko-oparative bank main 2016 main islamic banking kii shuruyaat hui, lekin sharia aadhaarit bank khaataa khulwaane waalon kii sankhya dahaai kaa aankada bhi paar nahin kar pai
 Interestingly, this unique banking service was started by Bharatiya Janata Party leader and Maharashtra Cooperative Minister Subhash Deshmukh, who is also the chairman of Lokmangal Bank
 subhash deshmukh ne india today ko phone par bataaya ki islamic banking kii shuruyaat sitambar 2016 main lokmagal bank main is vajah se kii gai taaki sharia ke mutabikbankingchahane vaale log apana khaataa khulavaa saken or karj le saken
 The bank kept both the account and the loan interest-free
 iske liye bank ne shunya byaaj dar vaale khate kholana shuru kiye
 Deshmukh explains that, "the kind of response that Islamic banking has received in a quarter of a year is disappointing
 logon main khaataa khulwaane kaa utsaah nahin he isliye karj dene kaa anupaat bhi kam he
 "asking the reason for this, Deshmukh says," Whoever deposits money in a human bank wants interest in return
 "kareeb das lakh kii aabaadi vaale sholapur shahar kii muslim aabaadi 20 fisadi he
 Dinkar Deshmukh, general manager of the bank's Solapur branch, says, "so far, one million rupees have been deposited in the branch under Islamic banking and the same amount has been given as loans to the needy
 donon hi byajmukt he
 "you know that the depositors themselves recommend the lenders here
 jitna jamaa hoga utana hi karj diya jayega

 Spoke to families of deceased farmers on phone&conveyed my condolences
 I'm here to meet them & will not be deterred frm voicing their concerns pradhanmantri narendra modi ne rajyasabha ke upasabhapati chunaav main endie ummidavaar ko samarthan dene ke liye shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare kaa dhanyavad adaa kiya he
 Right now the relationship between these two partners of NDA is not going well
 piem modi ne phone kar uddhav ko shukriya kaha he
 It is expected that Modi's phone call will normalize their relationship again
 bataa den ki guuruuvaar ko rajyasabha ke upasabhapati ke chunaav main jediu ke rajyasabha saansad harivansh singh ne vipaksh kii ore se congress ke bike hariprasad ko maat di thi
 a total of 125 votes were cast in favor of Harivansh, while a total of 101 votes were cast in favor of BK Hariprasad
 16 sadsy gaiyrhaazir rahe or 2 sadasyon ne vot nahin kiya
 The NDA candidate for Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman was also supported by Shiv Sena mps
 isse pehle, isi satr main shivasena ne loksabhaa main centre sarkaar ke khilaaf pesh hue avishvaas prastaav ke samay vot nahin dekar modi sarkaar se apni naaraazgi jaahir kii thi
 BJP president Amit Shah met Uddhav Thackeray to vote against the no confidence motion against the central government
 ummid kii ja rahi thi ki iske baad shivasena sarkaar ko bachaane ke liye samarthan main vot karegi
 However, this did not happen
 pichley kuch samay mendonon dalon ke bich ai talkhi kaa andajashivsena ke mukhpatr saamana ke sampadakeey se bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Despite being a constituent party of the NDA, the mouthpiece of the Shiv Sena targets the government on domestic affairs as well as the economic and foreign policies of the NDA government
 iske alaava, donon dal maharashtra main akele hi chunaav ladane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 BJP president Amit Shah indicated this at the end of last month
 shivasena ke avishvaas prastaav par voting se duuri banane ke baad se hi amit shah naaraaz bataae ja rahe hai
 Amit Shah called Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray a day before the no-confidence motion
 uske baad sambhaavna jataai ja rahi thi ki shivasena sarkaar ko samarthan degi, lekin unki ummiido par pani phir gaya
 Angered by Shiv Sena's behavior during the no-confidence motion, Amit Shah has told Maharashtra BJP leaders in Mumbai a few days ago that the way Shiv Sena has been behaving for some time, especially being absent in the no-confidence motion, then we have to contest alone in Maharashtra
 May be required
 isliye hamen sabhi 48 loksabhaa siton par taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 Amit Shah has asked the Maharashtra BJP leadership to appoint Lok Sabha in-charge for all 48 seats as soon as possible
 aapako bataa den ki shivasena pehle hi ghoshnaa kar chuki he ki vah 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav akele hi chunaav ladegi
 Let me tell you that before the motion of no confidence against the NDA government was written, it was written that dictatorship is going on in the country at this time
 iskaa samarthan karne kii jagah vah janata ke saath janaa chaahegi
 Since the time of Maharashtra assembly elections, the relationship between Shiv Sena and BJP has been volatile
 amit shah ke in sambandhon ko sulajhane kii koshish kaa nateeja sakaaratmak nahin dikhaa
 Now that PM Modi has spoken to Uddhav Thackeray, it can be believed that the relationship between the two parties will be normal
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle donon dalon kaa saath aana endie ke liye kaaphi ahm hoga

 ' kya ek sapana sach ho saktaa he, kya sapane main kisi ko boli gai baat sach ho sakati he, kya koi aatma ek manhat ko sapane main khazaane kaa pataa bataa sakati he
 Unbelievable, but the truth is the same and believe that most of you may have never heard the name of Daundia Kheda village of Unnao till today, but today the name and address of this village is on the tongue of most people of the country
 isaki ek vajah he or wo he baba shobhan sarkaar ko aayaa ek sapana
 According to Baba, Raja Ravram Bakhsh Singh came in his dream and he told Baba about the treasure trove under the temple and as soon as this thing reached the people and then ASI, an anonymous village in Uttar Pradesh became the most famous village in the country
 Had finished ab sabko intazaar he to bas is baat kaa ki kab ye khazaana baahar nikaala jayega or baba ke sapane kii baat haqiqat main badal jaaegi or agar baba shobhan sarkaar ke sapane kii baat sach nikali to is mandir ke neeche ek aisa khajaana dafn he jisaki keemat kaa andaja khud khajaanathak pahunchane vaale log bhithik-thikanhin laga paa rahe hai
 They are not able to decide whether there is a treasure of billions or trillions
 saalon se log is khajaane tak pahunchane kii koshish kar rahe hai lekin aaj tak koi bhi insaan is mishan menkamyaab nahin ho paaya
 Much effort has been made to find this treasure
 log ise kuber kaa khazaana bhi kehete hai, magar aaj tak ye kisi ke haath nahin laga
 This is the story of such a treasure, about which people have been hearing for years, but till date no person has been able to reach this buried treasure
 darasal ye aisa khajaana he jiske bare main naa aapane isse pehle kabhi suna hoga or naa hi dekha hoga lekin baba shobhan sarkaar ke sapane par eesai yahaan par khazaane kaa sach talash rahi he
 The search for Mahakhajane has started, but the question still remains as to who is the treasure
 koi kahata he ki ye khajaana raja raav ram baksh singh kaa he, to koi ise peshwa bajirao kaa khajaana bataa rahaa he lekin is khajaane kii hakeekat ham bataaenge aapako or uske liye jaananaa hoga is jagah kaa itihaas
 According to Professor Lal Amarendra Singh, son of Zamindar Visheshwar Singh of Daundia Kheda, a princely state of six and a half years old, this treasure belongs to Maharaj Trilokchand, ancestor of Ram Bakhsh
 professor laal amrendra singh kii maane to ye khajaana 16veen shatabdi main yahaan raaj karne vaale maharaj trilokchand ne jutaya tha or ye khajaana mandir ke peeche sthit tile main chipa ho saktaa he, jahaan raja rambakhsh ke pita babu bansat singh kaa baitka hua karata tha
 Mahakhajane may also have been hidden in the walls of the fort, it is claimed by Professor Lal Amarendra Singh, according to which there is also a map of this treasure which Raja Ram Baksh left to his mother
 darasal, is daawey ke peeche kai vajahen hai
 Maharaja Trilok Chand was the most majestic king here, who was called the most powerful king of the Vaishyas in the area
 trilok chand dilli ke badshaah lodi se jude huye the
 Apart from these, King Sumer Shah Chauhan of Mainpuri was also associated with Bahlol Lodi
 trilokchand kaa raaj unnav ke alaava baharich, kannauj, barabanki or lakhimpur khiri tak failaa hua tha
 That is why it is believed that such a huge treasure can be of Maharaja Trilokchand
 dondiakheda gaanv ke kile ke paas jo mandir he, wo raja ravraam baksh singh ne banwaaya tha
 Whereas the establishment of the shikhara of the temple and the installation of the idol was done by the zamindar Visheshwar Singh in 1932 and that is why the words of Professor Lal Amarendra Singh take power

 log in to irotic thriller siries het story ke chauthe part kii taiyaariyaan jor-shor se shuru ho gai hai
 The specialty of this series has been that it never takes any big face
 pehle part main pauli dam thim to duusare main surveen chawla or tisare main daiji shah or jarine khan ne apana jalawaa bikheraa tha
 In the fourth part, a new face has been chosen for Bollywood
 film main punjabi actress ihana dhillon ko liya gaya he
 The first part of the film was directed by Vivek Agnihotri, while the second and third part were directed by Vishal Pandya
 chauthaa part bhi vahi diarect karne ja rahe hai
 The specialty of the Hate Story series is that all its films have been female-dominated, and it has a tremendous mix of suspense and thriller along with sex
 haalanki ihana ne kaha he ki ve pehle is role ko lekar thode sanshay main thim
 But only after hearing the full story did he agree to the film
 beshak, sanshay hona bhi chahie kyonki bollywood har kisi kshetreey filmon main kaam karne vaale sitare kaa khwab hota he
 In such a situation, if the first film is bold, then there is a fear of getting a kind of label
 chaliye dekhte hai, punjabi bala is kirdaar ko kis tarah nibhaati hai
 Anyway, all the movies in the Hate Story series have been successful in making their way to the box office
 het story siries kii khaasiyat he ki isaki sabhi filmein mahila pradhan rahi hai, or isamen sex ke saath hi suspence or thriller kaa jabardast mixchar rahata he
 Although Ihana has said that she was a bit skeptical about this role earlier
 lekin puri kahani sunne ke baad hi unhone film ke liye hami bhari thi
 Of course, there must also be skepticism as Bollywood is the dream of every star working in regional films
 aise main agar pehali hi film bold ho to usase ek tarah kaa label chaspaan hone kaa dar rahata he
 Let us see how Punjabi Bala plays this character
 vaise bhi het story siries kii sabhi filmon box offis par apni naiya paar lagane main safal rahi hai

 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya has targeted West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee
 unhone mangalvaar ko kaha ki mamata banerjee pashchim bengal main apni manamaani chalaa rahi he
 Vijayvargiya said that there is a Mamata Banerjee government in West Bengal
 or unki sarkaar desh ke samvidhan ko nahin maan rahi he
 i am saying this because if the Governor also has to get permission from Mamata Banerjee for anything, then it is clear that Mamata Banerjee is running her own law
 bataa den ki pashchim bengal ke rajyapal ne kaha tha ki 24 north pargana ke jile ke daure ko lekar adhikariyon ko pehle se hi bataaya gaya tha
 But the district officials told me that they will not do any work without the permission of the state government
 yah puri tarah se asanvaidhanik he
 Attacking Mamta government, he said that there is no democracy in Bengal nor there is a constitution of India, there is Mamata Banerjee
 kahawat he naa khaataa naa bahi jo mamata kahen vahi sahi
 The atmosphere of anarchy has been transformed into democracy
 lekin ab matadaataaon ne bhi mamata banerjee se vidroh kar diya he
 'she said,' Anything she says in Frustration that she will put PM in jail, it can be understood that her mental balance has deteriorated
 ' vijayawargeey ne bengal hinsa par bhi bayaan diya

 There was not even a ruckus about the conversion in Agra that a new controversy has arisen in Chhattisgarh's Bastar
 yahaan 33 isai pariwaron kaa hindu dharm main parivartan karaayaa gaya he
 Though this is the case in October, but now the matter has become hot after photos related to the program came out
 bastar se bijepi saansad dinesh kashyap par dharm parivartan karaane kaa aarope laga he
 He was involved in the event
 jab dinesh kashyap se enditivi samvaadadaata ne is mudde par baat kii to saansad ne kaha ki yah dharm parivartan nahin, balki ghar vaapasi kaa kaarykram tha
 The MP said, earlier these people had converted to religion
 adivasee samudaay ke log apni samskruti main waapas aane chaahate the, ve hindu dharm se judana chaahate the
 Bajrang Dal and VHP (vishwa Hindu Parishad) conducted this program and all participated in the program on their own wish
 ullekhneey he ki agra main muslim pariwaron ke dharm parivartan ke maamle ko lekar sansad main pichley kuch kaaphi hangaamaa machaa tha
 During the ongoing debate in the Parliament on the issue of conversion, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu said on Thursday that there should be a law against conversion of the Center as well as all the states
 agra main dharmantaran kii baat par naidu ne kaha ki agar kuch galat hua he to upi sarkaar ko karrwai kerani chahie
 The Ministry of Home Affairs has also called for a report in the Agra conversion case with the UP government
 adhyadeshon ke taaja hamale par modi sarkaar par shuddhtavaad or vyaavhaarikta ke do siron ke bich kai alahada nazariye hai
 My own view is of pragmatism, even if it has some impatience
 vipaksh main rahete hue lagaataar das saal tak ek dal apane rajnatik aujaar ke rup main sansad kii kaarywahi ko thap rakhane ke sanvaidhanik aparaadh kaa kusuuravaar he, sirf isliye bhoomikaayen badalane par uske shikaar duusare dal ko aisa karne ko jaij nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 Getting laws passed by ordinance fast is a poor job in itself, but keeping Parliament as a permanent strategy is the same
 adhyadesh jari karke use sansad ke sanyukt satr main paarit karvaa dena vidweshpurn kaam he
 It is a mockery of the system of parliamentary monitoring and the prevention and balance of bicameral parliamentary system
 lekin sahamat hone ke baavjood tamaam vidheyakon kii raah main adnga daal dena bhi to vaisaa hi he
 Over the past decade, a dangerous pattern has arisen at the Center, on the lines of some politically battered states, where governments wait time between parliamentary sessions to complete work
 phir bhi, ho-halle se sansad ke kaam ko roak dena sirf adngebaaji nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Somebody would have given the name of hypocrisy while challenging it, and it was quite possible that a government with a real majority would have done so
 agar desh kii janata ne modi or bijepi ko hi yah kaam karne ke liye bahumat diya he to thik he, yahi sahi
 This week i want to talk about the comprehensive system where good, good, unquestioned, mandatory and regular laws and amendments remain stuck in Parliament for years while bad laws, many of the worst laws, are passed without any problems
 
 bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon iskaa ek acha udhaaharan he
 The ordinance brought for this intends to fix those most disastrous provisions
 jo kaarobaaron se zyada kisaanon ke virdohi hai or jinaki jaden gramin arthvyavastha ke bare main beesvin sadi kii avadharanaon main pabast thim
 At present, the entire BJP agrees on this, but this was so even when this law, so inefficiently drafted, was almost unquestionably passed earlier
 tab donon sadanon main bijepi / endie ke saansadon ne iske paksh main vot kiya tha
 The only party permanently in opposition in this case was Mamta Banerjee's TMC, but in such cases one can only expect such
 pichley kuch varshon main hamaari rajnatik birdari ne bina kisi bahes ke bure kanoonon ko paas karne main maharath hasil kar lee he
 a recent example is one that is likely to have missed our eyes, as it was hastily passed without debate — the 99th amendment to the Constitution, intended to restore the supremacy of the political class over the judiciary There has been some erosion in the last 25 years
 yah kaha janaa jaruri he ki kisi bhi masale par itani buree tarah vibhajit hamaari sansad ne ek ahm sanvaidhanik sanshodhan par ek din ke bheetar vot kar diya or sirf isliye kyonki yah sabhi saansadon ke manonukool tha
 The same Parliament has failed to pass a minor amendment to bring the FDI limit in the insurance sector from 26 to 49 per cent for the last nearly 11 years
 aisa tab he jabaki bijepi or congress donon is par sahamat bhi hai
 It is sad that the ordinance has to be adopted now and there will be a joint session in which it will be passed
 aap iske liye sirf ek paksh ko doshi nahin tehra sakate
 People created democracy for Suraj
 unhone sansad banaai taaki khud ko niyantrit or niyamit karne ke liye kanoon bana saken
 Over time, complex mechanisms like arrangements, parliamentary committees, hearings, debates, bills were notified on the Internet for wider consultation
 iske peeche buniyadi vichaar yah tha ki kanoon bananaa ek gambhir kaam he or ise itani baar jaancha-parkhaa jaae, santulan baithaaya jaae, khule or band main is par bahes kii jaae jitna sambhav ho
 Every democracy devised its own way of doing this
 america congress main kanoon nirmaataaon par party kii line par vot karne kii koi bandish nahin hoti, lihaaja vahaan cametiyon main khuli jan sunwaayee kii vyavastha he
 We have a whip system in parties where mps are tied
 isi tarah hamaare yahaan sansadeey samiti kii sunwaayeeyaan band daravaajon ke bheetar kii jaati hai
 The idea behind this is to allow mps to take decisions in a more open manner, even if it is against their party line
 mujhe ek baar aisi hi ek sansadeey samiti ke saamne talab kiya gaya tha jo samachar media main epadi par thi or jisaki adhyakshata somnath chatarji kar rahe the
 i found them to be very intelligent, well informed and good intentions
 masalan, maine epadi ke samarthak kii haisiyat se jab yah daleel di ki times of india ko rupert marda se bachaane kaa koi arth nahin banataa jab aarthik sudhaaron ke saaye main desh kaa seb utpaadak kisaan pehle hi america or newjiland se pratispardhaa jhel rahaa he, to macrsvaadi chatarji muskaraa kar bole, ''tab meraa sawaal yah he ki kya bhartiya seb utpaadak ko vaishvik pratispardhaa main laana vivekpurna faisla tha?” sab kuch kitna sabhy, acchhee niyat se kaha gaya or sansadeey daayre main tha
 Indeed, the basic idea is to address the challenge facing all democracies through this: protecting the public from the extremism of the majority
 beshak, upie ke daur main yah vichaar kuch zyada dur tak khinch gaya jab khud uske kai varisht or kathith garib samarthak paakhandee netaa apni hi sarkaar ke aarthik sudhaaron ke raste main khadey ho gaye, nae pension niyaman kanoon jaise dwipaksheeya or nirdosh kism ke vidheyak tak kaa unhone virodh kar daalaa
 It should be noted that pension reform was initiated by Vajpayee's NDA with the consent of Congress
 kanoon ko paarit karne ke liye sansad ke paas vakt kam tha, isliye paraspar sahmati bani ki 2004 main nai sansad ise paarit kar degi
 The Congress came to power in 2004 with the support of the Left parties
 disambar 2004 main usne ek adhyadesh bhi paarit kiya lekin apane bheetar ke hi vamapanthiyon ke virodh ke chalate use kanoon kii shakl nahin de pai
 It is here i would like to recall Pranab Mukherjee, who is currently the eldest of parliamentary and constitutional traditions among the living leaders
 maine 2005 ke ek saakshaatkaar main unase poocha tha ki upie pension sudhaar kanoon ke saath kya karne ja rahaa he
 He said with a smile, "your friend Chidambaram (then Finance Minister) will find its way out
" ve bade achche vakil hai
 "I will come to Pranabda again in a while
 is dauraan yahi sansad thi jise jaldbaaji main avivekpurna tareeke se gadhe gaye duniya bhar ke kanoonon ko paas karne main koi dikkat nahin hui, sirf isliye ki ye loklubhaavan kanoon the
 From MNREGA to reservation for obcs in higher education, from education, food rights and land acquisition to the new anti-rape law, all were passed in a hurry
 nae balaatkaar nirodhak kanoon par to sadak par hi paryaapt bahes ho gai thi or uskaa masavida bhi vahiin taiyaar ho chukaa tha
 The agreed parliament had just stamped on it
 lokapal bill to vastav main ek adhpaka or khatarnaak vidheyak tha jis par team anna naam ke ek samvidhanetar manch ke saath milakar saudebaaji kii gai or ek tay samay seemaa main sansad main us par mat daal die gaye
 Thankfully, he got stuck in Rajya Sabha and no one even takes his name today
 shiksha kaa adhikaar to upie ke sabase vahiyaat kanoonon main ek tha jiske paksh main sabhi ne vot daale
 It seemed that all our problems will be solved by these ornamental new laws
 sachaai yah he ki aaj narendra modi, arun jetali or amit shah bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon par hui bahes par nigaah daudaayen, to ve khud sakate main aa jaaenge ki bijepi ne isamen kuch or vinaashkari badlaav kii maang kii thi
 Or if they review the line taken by their two most important 'reformist' faces — one young and the other few — in parliamentary committees on insurance, GST, the Direct Taxes Code (DTC), they are ashamed It would be wrong to see what heinous criminal act he was doing at the time as compared to recent ordinances
 jab ek vibhajit siyasat adatan bure kanoonon ko laati he or bhale kanoonon kii raah main rode atakati he, tab aapaki niyati vahi hoti he jo abhi endie kii he or phir isse baahar nikalne ke liye aap sabase chota rasta talashte hai
 Then i would like to quote Pranab Mukherjee when he came out in this series of round table debate on economic reforms in 1990 called Crossfire by this magazine
 unhone kaha tha, ''ham jab lone mela lagaate the tab sochaa bhi nahin tha ki lone maafee kabhi di jaaegi
 After that, how many loan fairs were held and how many loans were forgiven
 thik vaise hi jaise jane kitne bure kanoon paas kiye gaye or unhen kalantar main palat diya gaya!punasch:arabiai, byaaj daren or aarthik susti dobaaraa surkhiyon main hai
 Many of my economist friends who are pro-economic reforms have long persuaded me in favor of decisive interest rate cuts
 idhar kai mujhase puch rahe hai ki maine apana najariya kyon palat diya
 i have a small question in the answer: Who should cut rates? The work of banks is extensive
 ve apane jamakartaon ko bahut kam daren dete hai jabaki karjadaaron se ucch dar par byaaj lete hai
 Why can't these banks reduce their rates and reduce their spread instead of whining about rbi's charity? This is because they have a large amount of debts that have not been repaid

 sansad kii loklekha samiti(piesi) ne 2ji spectrum ghotaale kii apni report ke masaude main tatkaaleen kendriya vitt mantri pi
 Criticized Chidambaram and the Prime Minister
 bhaajapa kemurali manohar joshi21 sadasyeey piesi ke adhyaksh hai
 It has seven mps from Congress, four from BJP and two each from DMK and AIADMK and one each from BJD, JD (U), BSP, SP, Shiv Sena and CPI (M)
 congress or dramuk saansadon ne report rokane kii dhamkee di
 He was also ready to remove Joshi from the post of president if needed
 or 28 april ko piesi kii baithak main abhootpurv hangaamaa hua
 The UPA members, who came up with a strategy as soon as the meeting started, termed the report as 'outsourced', accusing Joshi of leaking the report, calling the report unilateral and demanding his resignation
 congress ke nau, dramuk ke do or sapabaspa ke ekek sadsy ne likhit daryaft kii ki ve report khaarij karne ke liye vot dete hai
 Seeing the matter go out of hand, Joshi adjourned the meeting
 dopaher jab baithak phir shuru hui to congress sadsy safuddin soj ne report ko radd karne kaa prastaav rakhaa jise upie ke alaava sapa-basapa ke sadasyon ne samarthan diya
 The meeting ended as the altercation in both the wheels
 joshi ne daawa kiya ki unhone baithak sthagit kar di or uthakar chale gaye
 Subsequently, the UPA members, with the help of Sapabaspa, elected Soz as the president "elected" and "rejected" the report
 phir soj khud joshi ke karyaalay gaye or piesi kii sthagit baithak main unki sadaarat main paarit hua prastaav unke karyaalay ko de aae
 Congress members said that Joshi was not ready to listen to them and "ran" from the meeting
 '' vaise niyamon ke mutabik kisi vittiya samiti ke adhyaksh ko loksabhaa adhyaksh niyukt karte hai or vah sadsy loksabhaa kaa hota he
 The PAC report has made serious allegations against Chidambaram
 isamen 15 farvari, 2008 ko unki ore se manmohan singh ko likhe ek patr kaa hawala diya gaya he
 This letter was given by the then Telecom Minister A
K
 raja ke license kii nilaamee karne ke fouran baad likhaa gaya tha
 In this, Chidambaram argued that the price of spectrum should be decided on the basis of its limited resources and capacity utilization
 aisa keval khuli nilaamee prakriya se hi ho saktaa he
 He then suggested to the Prime Minister that the matter should be considered closed
 report main kaha gaya he ki vitt mantri ke note se piesi ''dang'' rah gai or ''niraash'' hui
 The PAC has recommended a full inquiry into the action of the former finance minister, accusing Chidambaram of trying to smuggle
 report main kaha gaya he, ''jab tak is maamle kii puri jaanch na ho jaae or (tatkaaleen) vitt mantri kii is tarah kii gaiyr maamuli harakat kii vajah desh ko bataai nahin jaae tab tak samiti santusht nahin ho sakati
 Sensing the mood of the PAC President, the Congress and the DMK were trying to delay the release of this report till last week
 sattadhari gathbandhan ke saansad chaahate the ki report ko antim rup se pehle raja piesi ke samaane bayaan den
 But perhaps Joshi realized that it was a trick to delay
 piesi kaa kaarykaal ek saal kaa he or yah 30 april ko samaapt hone vaala he
 Though Joshi will be its president until next year, its members will change next month
 nae sadasyon kii bhartee se is report ko jari karne main swaabhaavik rup se deree hoti
 Congress mps are more concerned about the Prime Minister and his office being wrapped up than blaming Chidambaram
 is babat media main khabar aane ke saath hi 27 april kii shaam ko congress ne aakraamak rukh apana liya
 Member of Congress in PAC
 es
 Rao, Saifuddin Soz and Naveen Jindal and dmk's T
 shiva ne joshi par aarope lagaaya ki unhone report par puri samiti kii charchaa se ek din pehle hi use prachaarit kar diya or isi aadhaar par unhone joshi ke istife kii maang kii
 He accused Joshi of "haphazardly" pushing the report to take "political advantage"
 raav ne kaha, ''ham sarvasammati vaali report chaahate hai
 But why do they want to hurry? What is their intention Do we have to say everything that the Speaker is saying? "according to Rao, Joshi wanted to" discredit and destabilize the cabinet and government by being prejudiced and malicious "
 jindal ne india today se kaha, ''is report main kai visangatiyaan hai
 It mentions some members who made a statement in front of the PAC, when in fact they did not come
 mahadhivaktaa ji
 E
 vaahnavati or sibiai nideshak e
 P
 singh 15 april ko gavaahi dene vaale the lekin ve nahin aae
 The report says he testified
 yah mahaj report kaa masauda he
 "there are reasons for the Congress to be worried about this report
 report ke masaude main yah kahkar pradhanmantri ko kuch raahat di gai he ki raja ne ''nilaamee'' ke bare main unki salaah kii ''andekhi'' kii or unhen bhartiya doorsanchaar niamak praadhikaran (tri) kii siforeeshon ke bare main ''gumraah'' kiya, jisase andeh kaa laabh khatm ho jaataa he
 The report raises serious questions on the developments in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) following Raja's letter of December 26, 2007
 us patr main unhone nilaamee ke bare main pradhanmantri kii salaah spasht rup se khaarij kar di thi
 According to the PAC, the Prime Minister was given the Raja's letter of December 26, 2007, along with the advice note (which recommended the auction) of then External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee on January 7, 2008, i
e
 12 days after receiving Raja's letter
 The Prime Minister saw her
 tajjub kii baat he ki 11 janvari, 2008 ko pradhanmantri ke nijee sachiv ne apane bos kii manshaa jaahir kii ki ''license se jude maamle par dhyaan diya jaae
 "it is worth mentioning that Raja had issued Unified Access Service (UAS) license on January 10, 2008, one day in advance
 yah file 15 janvari ko spashtikaran ke saath phir pradhanmantri ke paas bheji gai
 The file then went to the private secretary who wrote on it that "the Prime Minister wants it to be informally shared with the department and they do not want formal dialogue and want to keep the PMO away
" '' kya pradhanmantri jaanboojhkar us ghotaale se khud ko dur rakhana chaahate the jisaki paraten khulne lagi thim?piesi report main kaha gaya he, ''piemo ko dur rakhane kii pradhanmantri kii ichha se sanchaarmantri ko apni anyaaypurna, manamaani or sandigdh yojana ko amali jama pehanaane main madad mili
 "the PAC report puts the responsibility on Manmohan using the acknowledgment of Raja's December 26 letter on 3 January 2008
 report main kaha gaya he, ''lagata he ki 3 janvari, 2008 ko mantri kaa patr milane kii sweekruti se pradhanmantri ne unhen apni yojana par aage badhane ke liye paroksh rup se hari jhandi dikhaa di
 "this report expresses indignation over the Prime Minister's claim
" mahalekha pareekshak evam niyantrak (kaig) kii chaunkaane vaali report ke baad pehle doorsanchaar mantri kapil sibbal or yojana ayog ke upaadhyaksh montek singh ahaluvalia ne kaha ki rajasav jutaney par kabhi dhyaan nahin diya gaya
 The report states, "in view of his own view in India Telecom 2007 (this statement) is contradictory"
 usamen kaha gaya ki sarkaar ko rajasav kii sambhaavna ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya janaa chahie kyonki duniyabar kii sarkaron ne spectrum aavanton se kaaphi rajasav jutaya he
 "then the report says with a bit of sarcasm," The PMO needs to follow the Prime Minister's two separate statements
 ''is report main do or misaalen di gai hai jisase 2ji ghotaale main piemo kii bhoomika kaa sanket miltaa he
 The first example is in October 2007
 us samay tak doorsanchaar vibhaag (dot) ko yueyes license ke liye 1 aktubar kii samaysima se pehle 575 aavedan mil chuke the
 At that time DOT member (technology) wrote a letter to the Department of Law Affairs seeking a legal opinion to deal with the flood of applications in a fair and equitable manner
 piesi report ke mutabik, vidhi mantralay ke sachiv or vidhi mantri ne is maamle ko adhikaar praapt mantriyon ke samooh (ijioem) ke paas bhejne kii jarurat par bal diya
 Raja wrote a letter to the Prime Minister describing the Law Ministry's suggestion as "out of context"
 aise main piemo ko donon mantralayon ke bich matbhed ke mudde ko mantrimandal main vichaar ke liye bhejnaa chahie tha
 But he did not do so
 baad main piemo ne piesi ko bataaya ki use vidhi mantralay kii ore se ijioem ke liye koi sifarish nahin mili
 The PAC report rejects the pmo's claim of ignorance
 report main kaha gaya he, ''samiti piemo ke is jawaab se sahamat nahin he ki ijioem gathit karne ke liye vidhi mantri se use koi sujhav mila tha
 
 
 The Communications Minister himself told the Prime Minister about the idea of the Law Minister with his views
 ''piesi ke mutabik, ''piemo nishchit rup se sthiti nahin bhaanp sakaa yaa phir use mookadarshak bana diya gaya
 The second example is in 2006 when the UPA government changed the reference points of the Group of Ministers (gom) on telecommunications
 yah jioem aktubar 2003 main rajg ke shashan main bana tha
 At the insistence of the then Telecom Minister Dayanidhi Maran, the issue of price of spectrum, especially from the GOM, was dropped
 ye sandarbh bindu 27 november, 2006 ko piemo ke sidhe aadesh par cabinet sachivalay ne badale
 The Finance Ministry now knows nothing about the spectrum price and DOT had to decide completely
 avishwasaneey rup se tamaam niyamon kaa ulanghan karke sandarbh binduon membedlaav ko cabinet kii manjuuri nahin dilaai gai, yahaan tak ki baad main bhi yah manjuuri nahin dilaai gai
 The report said, "the Cabinet Secretary and the PMO were aware of these but they did not take action to rectify it
" ''vidambnaa hi he ki sarkaar ne sanyukt sansadeey samiti (jepisi) banane kii vipaksh kii maang kaa virodh kiya, jisase sansad kaa ek satr barbaad ho gaya
 The government argued that the PAC could investigate the 2G scam
 piesi ke paas sarkaar ke vaarshik vittiya khaaton, sarkari kharch or kaig reporton kii jaanch karne kaa adhikaar he
 Perhaps the government hoped that the PAC would be limited to examining the CAG report on 2G
 lekin piesi ne usase pare jaanch kii
 With the Congress accusing the BJP of preparing a "prejudiced" PAC report, the political atmosphere is set to be heated
 sarkaar ke lagaataar ghotaalon main ghire hone se vipaksh ke hausale buland hai or aise main vah upie ko gherne kaa avasar haath se nahin jane degaa
 Governance is bound to be affected by this political discord
 hyderabad main wetenry mahila doctor kii gangrape or hatya maamle kii sunwaayee ke liye mehboob nagar jile main special court kaa gathan kiya he
 The matter will now be expedited in this court

 Due to her increased popularity, Shilpa also demanded to increase her fees
 lekin unhone jo fees maangi uske liye produsar taiyaar nahin hue or iske chalate hi shilpa ne serial chhodane kaa man bana liya he
 According to a news published in Dainik Jagran, Rashmi Desai, the well-known actress of the small screen, is replacing Shilpa in the serial
 matlab ab reshmi anguri bhabhi banakar darshakon ko hansaane vaali hai
 Only time will tell how much Reshmi can do with Angoori Bhabhi's character
 haalanki shilpa serial chhod rahi hai or rashmi desai unki jagah lene ja rahi hai, is baat kii aadhikarik ghoshnaa philhal nahin hui he
 The comments gauratlab he ki bahut hi kam samay main anguri bhabhi kii kirdaar main shilpa scindia ne apni pahchaan banaate hue kaaphi surkhiyaan bator lee hai
 'sahi Pakke Hain' This is his dialogue, which the audience has liked very much

 On behalf of people of Bihar & especially Patna, i welcome PM @narendramodi to my home turf & parliamentary constituency
 It'sa privilege1>2
 
 
 
 & honor to host PM Modi as Chief Guest of the otherwise tame centenary celebrations of the once famous Patna University on October 14
 But there is another reason for Bihari Babu's displeasure
 shanivaar ko hi ek or sarkari kaarykram jo rajdhani patna se 100 kilometre dur mokama main yojit kiya gaya he, is kaarykram ko NHAI ne yojit kiya he
 Where many bridge and road construction work will be started
 lekin yahan bhi akhabaaron main chape vigyaapan main yaha tak ki purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi kaa naam he, lekin sinha ko bulaayaa tak nahin gaya he
 While some roads are also part of his Patna Saheb parliamentary constituency
 nishchit rup se sinha ko bulaayaa ja saktaa tha lekin dikkat ye he ki bijepi kii bihar ikai unke upasthiti se asahaj ho jaati he
 The party is angered by his statements and in his sentence makes his name disappear from the list of invitations from public events
 haalanki bihar bijepi ke netaa kehete hai ki in sabhi karyrakram se un logon kaa koi lenaa-dena nahin sab kuch pradhanmantri karyaalay tay karata he
 However, the leaders of the Bihar BJP say that the Prime Minister's Office decides everything from these programs to those who have nothing to do
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne bhi mana ki patna shahar nahin balki ek bahut bada gaanv he
 Nitish Kumar was speaking at a government function in Patna on Sunday
 nitish ne mana ki patna kii haalat khasta he
 Neither cleanliness is good nor people believe in cleanliness
 mukhyamantri ke rup main nitish ne mana ki chhath ke avasar ko agar apwaad maan liya jaye to shaayad hi kabhi logon main saafe safaai ko lekar jaagrukta hoti he
 He acknowledged that a social campaign is also needed on this issue
 event manjar ban kar rah gaye hai nitish kumaar, bihar kaa garib-gurba unase ub gaya he- shivanand tiwari tippaniyan However, Nitish said that Patna is one of the few places in the country where one gets to hear the sound of her birds in the morning
 unhone kaha ki jab wo china gaye the tab chidiyon kii awaz to chhod dijie pakshi dekhne ko taras gaye
 Nitish believed that the rules of nature
 ke viruddh jo pragati karne kii hode lagi he uskaa parinaam acha nahin hoga
 But, in the meantime, the question is that the government in Bihar has been in power for the last twelve years, then who will be responsible for the reform and when will the efforts to improve the condition of the capital Patna begin

 haalanki nitish ne kaha ki patna desh ke kuch jagahon main se ek he jahaan subah subah apni chidion kii awaz sunne ko mil jaati he
 He said that when he went to China, then leave the sound of birds and then he was pity to see birds
 nitish ne mana kii prakruti kii niyamo
 The progress that is being made against it will not result in good results
 magar, is bich sawaal he ki bihar main sarkaar par pichley baarah varshon se nitish sata par qaabiz he, tab sudhaar kii zimmedaari kiski hogi or rajdhani patna kii haalat sudhaarney ke kiye prayaas kab se shuru hoga
 But, in the meantime, the question is that the government in Bihar has been in power for the last twelve years, then who will be responsible for the reform and when will the efforts to improve the condition of the capital Patna begin
 chah saal pehle disambar ke maheene main ek nirbhaya ne puure hindustan ko rulaa diya tha
 Six years later, in January, a zenb turned the eyes of the whole of Pakistan
 ji haa, wo hindustan kii nirbhaya thi
 This is Zainab of Pakistan
 donon ke mulk alag, naam juda, mazahab bhi alag
 But in both places, the cruelty and the poor were the same
 zaynab pakistan ke bas ek ghar kii beti thi
 But the whole Pakistan was crying on his funeral
 jaanaten hai kyon? kyonki saat saal ke janaaze kaa gam bahut bada hota he
 Nirbhaya of Hindustan, that of Zain Bahindustan of Pakistan was on 16 December 2012
 pakistan kaa 5 janvari 2018
 Then for 13 days the whole of Hindustan used to ask this every day
 ab kisi he wo? kuch haalat sudhari? wo batch to jaaegi? sach bataanaa usko kuch hoga to nahin? is baar paanch dinon tak puraa pakistan puch rahaa tha--kahaan he wo? usko kuch hoga to nahin? mil to jaaegi naa? thik to hogi naa wo?chah saal pehle hindustan main har ghar par, daftar main, bazaar main, rishtedaar, dost, padosi
 Everyone was just talking about that
 usee ko puch rahe the
 Wanted to know about the same
 chah saal baad pakistan ke har ghar main, daftar main, bazaar main, rishtedaar, dost, padosi
 Everyone was just talking about that
 wo hindustan kii nirbhaya thi to is baar pakistan kii saat saal kii bacchee zaynab
 Whole Pakistan cried on whose funeral
 maasoom jainab kii maut par is vakt puraa pakistan matam bana rahaa he
 Zainab was a common child
 behad aam parivaar se
 But the death that occurred on his part and the hardship before death made him dear to every house in Pakistan
 har dil ko chalni kar diya
 Broke every parent
 ghar se agava kar rape or hatyaisi saal paanch janvari ko pakistan ke punjab praant ke kasoor ilaake se saat saal kii jainab ghar ke paas se hi achaanak gaayab ho gai
 For five days, the people searched for him everywhere
 par paanch din baad wo ghar se thodi hi duuri par kooday ke dhar par padi milti he wo bhi murda
 Later postmortem report shows that Zainab was murdered and before the murder she was subjected to a lot of torture that needed to be told
 aag kii tarah faili khabarphul jaisi jainab kaa lahore jaise shahar main ye anjaam
 Suddenly, the news spread all over Pakistan
 media or soshal media main bas jainab kii tasviir dekh kar hi logon kaa kalejaa fatne laga
 In Pakistan, all other issues including politics and terrorism were marginalized and the demand of Zainab's murderer to be captured and accounted for
 nirbhaya ke baad jaisaa manjar hindustan kaa tha, jainab ke baad thik vaisaa hi ab pakistan main tha
 The government of Punjab province of Pakistan was under tremendous pressure
 logon kaa gussa badhata hi ja rahaa tha
 Police was the biggest target
 isi baach 17 din guzar jate hai
 Finally, on the 18th day, Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif himself comes forward and declares that Zainab's murderer has been caught
 aaropee tak aise pahunchi pulisapakistan ke itihaas main shaayad kisi jurm yaa vaardaat kii aisi tafteesh isse pehle kabhi nahin hui
 To reach Zainab's murderer, the police decided that she would get the DNA of every male between the ages of 15 and 50 living within a radius of two and a half kilometers of Zainab's house
 shahar ke har us shaks ko uthaa kar poochtacha karegi jiskaa criminal ricard he
 The kid will pick up the thief gang, rapist, street imprint Majnu, human traffickers, gangs who make child porn movies and Psycho Criminal and finally one of the methods worked
 or 18 din baad aakhirkaar jainab kaa gunahagaar or uskaa cheharaa donon saamne aa gaye
 The clue of the accused found from DNA was that when the samples of 1150 people were being taken under the supervision of the police, then a young man standing in the line left the line and ran away
 magar us yuvak ke chachaa ke diene se doctoron ne ye bataa diya ki aaropee isi ke khandaan kaa he
 The police had now got a clue as to which family the accused belonged to and who they were
 kyonki us khandaan kaa wo iklauta shaks tha jisane sample nahin diya tha
 The police had reached very close to Zainab's criminal
 magar police ko us gunagahaar or uske khandaan kaa sach kisi bhi keemat par chupa kar rakhana tha
 Because the fear was that angry people should not kill the whole family
 lihaaja police aaropee ke puure parivaar ko hi uthaa kar gupt jagah par le gai
 Later somehow the police eventually caught that person as well
 or phir uske diene kii jaanch kii gai
 His DNA matched the DNA found on Zainab's corpse
 zaynab kaa padosi tha aaropee darindaaaropee kasoor kaa hi rahanaa vaala 24 saal kaa yuvak tha, jo jainab kaa padosi tha
 Which she used to call Uncle
 naam tha imran
 Imran was to come to Zainab's house
 vahi zaynab ko paanch janvari ko kooday ke is dher ke kareeb le gaya tha
 Where he first pleaded with Zainab and then killed him
 serial repist or killer niklaa imranpunjab police ne jab imran ke diene ko milan kai lambit maamalon se kiya to khulaasa hua ki imran sirf zaynab kaa gunahagaar nahin he, balki pichley ek saal main isi ilaake main usne zaynab samet 5 or bacchiyon ke saath apni havas mitaai or phir unhen maar daalaa
 That is, he was a serial rapist and serial killer
 aaropee imran ke pakade jane ke baad ab puure pakistan main use fouran faansee par lataka die jane kii maang uth rahi he
 The Chief Minister of the state himself, Shahbaz Sharif, is fast talking about justice in this matter
 iske liye ek fast trek cameti banane kaa bhi unhone elaan kar diya he

 We have reviewed this flagship device
 aaie jaanate hai ki kyanote 7 kii dikkaton ke baad Galaxy Note 8 bazaar main apni pakad banane main kaamyaab ho paaegaa?sabase pehle baat dizin or bild quality kiughalady Note 8 kii body glass or metal kii he yah puri tarah chaukor he or iske kinare karvd hai
 Its display is also dual edge curved, but not much
 disple ke donon taraf koi bejal nahin hai
 Despite having a large screen and a big phone, it is not difficult to hold and can be used comfortably
 phone ke neeche spikar gril, yuasabi tip si or headphone jaik diya gaya he
 s Pen is given in the corner
 upar kii tarah sim or memory card trey diya gaya he or microphone bhi he
 The right side is locked while the left is the volume rocker
 iske thik neeche dedicated biksabi ke liye ek batan diya gaya he
 There is a dual camera setup in the rear, next to which a fingerprint scanner is given
 front main home batan nahin he or upar selfi camera ke alaava kai sensor die gaye hai
 Overall, in terms of design, this smartphone is the best sample ever offered by Samsung
 disple or yujar interfesavaise to Galaxy Note 8 kii kai khaasiyaten hai, lekin isamen aisa disple diya gaya he ki agar aap kisi ke saamne ise yuj karen to wo ise ek baar to jarur hi dekhegaa
 Its screen 6
 3 inch kii he yani iphone 7 Plus kaaphi zyada, lekin agar phone ko iphone 7 Plus ke saath rakhenge to yah zyada bada nahin lagata
 This is because the aspect ratio of the screen is 18: 5: 9
 isamen super AMOLED ke saath 3K QHD+ disple di gai he jiskaa rejolushan 2960X1,440
 In simple words, its display is many times brighter and better than HD or Full HD
 is smartphone main bhi Galaxy S8 vaala hi Infinity disple yuj kiya gaya he or yani kam bejal or zyada screen
 Whether you want to watch movies, do gaming, watch videos or watch photos detailing, its display will not disappoint you at all
 is phone main ek hai parformens opshan bhi he, jise aneble karke WQHD+ actevet kar sakate hai
 After this, the display is worth watching
 saaf lafjon main kahen to isaki disple khubasurat he or aap ise yuj karenge to aapako shaayad kisi bhi duusare smartphone kii disple feeki lage
 Talking about performance, this phablet is not only for common use, but more than that it is also for productivity
 iske jariye aap kai aisi chijen kar sakate hai jo shaayad duusare smartphone ke liye sambhav nahin hai
 It has an Exynos 9 octacore processor which is Samsung's own
 yah procesar qolkaim snapadragon ke letest varjan ke baraabar hi he
 It has 64GB of internal memory with 6GB of RAM, which you can increase through micro SD card
 hafte bhar ke istemaal main yah smartphone rocket kii speed se chalaa
 Think of it like a brace
 kehane kaa matlab ye ki ek ap chalaaen yaa ek saath 10 eps, is smartphone na to speed kam hogi or naa hi ye hang karegaa
 Moving from one app to another is easy and the loading time is minimal
 hamane is smartphone play store ke sabase bade or zyada graphics vaale game khele hai, lekin hamen koi lag nahin dikhaa
 There is currently no better smartphone in the market for multi-tasking
 ek saath do eps yuj karnaa yaa phir ek saath chating karte hue video dekhnaa
 Quite easy with this phone
 isamen ek feechar diya gaya he jiske jariye ek saath do eps ko open kar sakate hai or ek saath yuj bhi kar sakate hai
 Because of the large display and powerful processor, multi-tasking experience has been much better
 remote ke jariye kisi duusare computer ko yuj karnaa ho yaa phir drawing kerani phone main koi rukawat nahin
 Software: Generally we do not focus too much on software while reviewing other smartphones
 aisa isliye kyonki kamobesh segment ke sabhi smartphone ke software ek jaise hote hai
 But since it is Galaxy Note 8 and Samsung also specially makes UI for it
 isliye ham iske software par bhi baat karenge
 It has the company's custom user interface on Android N
 note siries kii khaasiyat productivity hoti he
 The features of the s Pen are amazing, as soon as you remove the s Pen, you will find a menu in the corner, there are many options in it which are all useful
 pehle bhi ye feechar tha, lekin is baar es pen ke liye kai nae fitures jode gaye hai
 It has a live message feature which we liked very much
 es pen ke jariye aap live massej likhakar vaise hi jif kii tarah send kar sakate hai
 Apart from this, there is a feature of note making on the standby screen which is quite easy, just remove the s Pen and write it on the black screen
 agar koi reminder he to aap ise olves on disple par pin kar sakate hai
 Writing with s Pen on s pendisplay now gives a better experience than before
 kyonki isaki tip pehle se patali he
 If it is raining, you can use s Pen by removing it, because this time the company has made both mobile and Aspen water resistant
 phone par koi artical pard rahe hai or use anuwaad karnaa he, to iske liye esapen nikaaliye or use varj ke upar tip ko lie
 You don't know what you need to touch
 aise hi or bhi kaam ke fitures hai jo es pen or Galaxy Note 8 main chaar chand lagaataa he
 Bixby Virtual Assistant has arrived to compete bixbisiri and Google Assistants
 Galaxy Note 8 ke saath yah artificial intelligence besd biksabi shandaar kaam karata he
 Now voice commands have also arrived in India through an update
 die gaye batan se ise actevet kar sakate hai or bol kar apana smartphone analock bhi kar sakate hai
 Apart from this, the Bixby vision given in the camera is of great use
 photo ko isse clic karen or aapako uski pahchaan batayega yaa phir sabaject se judi tasviren dikhayega
 It's fun if you sync Bixby to Facebook
 biksabi ke yujar interphes main aapaki dilchaspee ke hisaab se fasebuk ke likes or duusare fitures dikhenge
 However, Bixby is definitely lagging behind Google Assistant in many cases
 camerisake rier main 12 megapixl ke do camere die gaye hai
 One is a wide angle lens while the other is a telephoto lens
 donon hi camere main optical image stebligeshan die gaye hai or donon hi camere ek saath kaam karne main sakasham hai
 There is a camera module similar to the iphone 7 Plus which also has 2X optical zoom
 iskaa camera kitna behatar he aap iskaa andaja di gai tasveeron se hi laga sakate hai jise maine Galaxy Note 8 se clic kii hai
 But still tell you that it has a live focus feature that works to blur the background
 photo live focus mod main clic kii he to becoground bler aayega, lekin agar aap chahen to ise normal photo bhi bana sakate hai
 You can click on Adjust Background Blur to go from Normal to Bokeh effect
 is smartphone kii camera quality Galaxy S8 Plus jaisi hi he
 The only difference is that you can blur the background with the dual camera in it
 iske alaava kam raushnee main bhi acchhee photography hoti he
 However, in the case of Bagcrowd Blur, we found a better iphone 7 Plus
 batreepichley Galaxy Note 7 ko samsung ne isliye band kar diya, kyonki uski bydaree main aag lag rahi thi
 Obviously Samsung cannot repeat that mistake, so the company has done a lot of work on its battery which is commendable
 aaj kal smartphone kii bydaree zyada power kii jarur hoti hai, lekin garm hona or fatna aam baat he
 Samsung has installed a less powerful battery than the Galaxy S8 Plus, which is 3300 mah
 isliye overol byaap bhi Galaxy S8 Plus se kam he
 You will be able to run it comfortably throughout the day on mixed use
 lekin agar aap video khub dekhte hai, jam kar photography karte hai or puure din surfing karenge to nishchit taur par aapako power socket dhundhna hoga
 The battery charges quickly, as it has the option of fast charge and in half an hour the battery can be charged so that it can run for the whole day using standby and little use
 bydaree life thodi or zyada ho sakati thi
 Should you take this smartphone? One thing of a hundred things, if your budget is 65 to 70 thousand rupees then you must take this smartphone

 Deepika and Shahid are getting 10 crores while Ranveer is getting around 13 crores fees
 vaise film ke teenon kalakaaron ko ek-duusare kii fees ke bare main jaankaree nahin he
 But they say that nothing can be hidden in the industry
 khatm ho gai prem kahani, deepika ab nahin hai 'bajirao' kii mastaniranvir singh par aditya meharbaanfilm main ranvir or shahid kii fees main asamantaaon ke do kaaran ho sakate hai
 Makers consider Ranveer Kodipika and Shahid to be big stars
 ek baar aditya chopra ne kaha tha ki ranvir singh unhen king khan ke baraabar kamakar dete hai
 Ranveer has become Aditya Chopra's favorite in five years
 khabaren yahaan tak he ki aditya ke offis main shahrukh or salmaan ke alaava sirf ranvir singh kaa poster laga he
 Anything for the role Karegaranvir's increased fees is also possible because he is the main character of the film
 ranvir villen bane hai or is kirdaar main dhalane ke liye unhone kaaphi mehnat kii he
 Due to this attitude of Ranveer, he is a favorite actor of Bhabhansali
 vah apni damdaar acting ke balboote sabhi bade stars ko kadi takkar de rahe hai
 After all, why is Ranveer Singh the prince of dreams? When Shahid felt that the role of Ranveer was intimidating between actors in the past
 shahid nahin chaahate the ki ‘padmavati’ main ranvir kaa role unhen overshadow karen
 Therefore, he placed a condition in front of Bhansali that his role should also be made as strong as Ranveer

 (input: bhashaa) In Telangana, BJP has become an attacker due to a poster released by Congress

 The Congress Election Commission Coordination Committee protested against the alleged failure of the ECI in the recent Telangana Assembly elections
 virodh ke ek hisse ke rup main congress party ne telugana main 'draupadi vastraharan' kaa chithran karne vaale poster lagaae the
 The controversial poster featured 'draupadi Vastraharan', a scene from the Mahabharata
 poster main matadaataaon ko draupadi ke rup main dikhaaya gaya he, vahiin, ERO, DEO or CEO ko kaurav ke rup main vastra utaarte dikhaaya gaya he
 At the same time, the Election Commission of India (ECI) is shown as Dhritarashtra
 jabaki poster main telugana ke mukhyamantri or tiares pramukh ke chandrashekhar raav or AIMIM supremeo asaduddin ovaisi mookadarshak ke rup main ek taraf khadey hai
 In this poster, voters are shown as Draupadi
 or is puure poster ko capshan diya gaya he- telugana main loktantr
 Following the controversy, BJP state spokesperson Krishna Sagar Rao released a video in which Congress leaders were allowed to use 'draupadi Vastra Praharan' as a design template to protest against the Election Commission in Hyderabad
 An unconditional apology was sought from Rahul
 unhone congress kii navaniyukt mahasachiv priyanka gandhi wadra se bhi sawaal kiya, "kya vah is tarah kii baat ko sweekaar karenge, jahaan ek raajnneetik party dwaara virodh ke liye poster main mahilaon or hindu puranic paatro ko cartoon ke rup main istemaal kiya gaya
 Meanwhile, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi said that it is everyone's right to protest against their demands, but the kind of work the Congress party has done by putting up posters bearing the Telangana chief minister is completely wrong

 When 26-year-old Dharampal, a resident of Khevda village in Haryana, has high cabbage yield, he goes straight to Azadpur mandi in Delhi as all the goods in the mandi are sold without layoffs
 gaanv main nijee badi retail company kaa collection centre (sisi) he, lekin dharmpal kaa company ke saath pichley saal kaa anubhav acha nahin rahaa
 He had 300 crates (8 kg) of cabbage according to the company's scale and the company assured him to take it the next day
 lekin agle din sirf 100 cret hi liye
 The remaining 200 crates of goods were damaged due to the delay
 dharmpal kehete hai, ''jab hamaare paas zyada maal hota he, to company par bharosa nahin karte, balki sidhe mandi chale jate hai
 "the company which purchases directly from the farmers buys goods from the farmers at the market rate as per the demand, which makes most of the farmers dependent on the mercy of the artisans in the market
 reliance fresh, big bazaar jaisi nijee companiyaan yaa sarkari kshetra kii company safal mandi se bhi maal kharidti hai
 These companies have set up their own centers in Azadpur Mandi, Delhi
 reliance, big bazaar or safal ke centre mandi ke si block main aasapaas hi hai
 Vegetables and fruits are collected at their center since morning
 vahaan kuch karmchaaree unki chantai or safai karke cret rakhkar company ke trek se maal ko vitaran centre tak pahunchaate hai
 The process of sending goods from these distribution centers to the store starts at 4 am the next day
 reliance kaa maal dilli ke kareeb haryana main kundali sthit collection and processing centre (sipisi) main to big bazaar kaa maal panipat or safal kaa dilli ke mongolpuri sthit centre par pahunchataa he
 Although the farmers who sell the goods directly to the companies are saved from the hard work and cost of going to the mandi, but they do not get much benefit from it, because the companies rate the mandi at their collection center
 unka rate 24 ghante tak maanya hota he or is dauraan mandi main rate kam-zyada ho to bhi kisaanon ko purana rate hi miltaa he
 Not only this, since the companies sort the vegetables, the farmers have to take the rest of their produce to the market and sell it
 yani mandi se puri tarah aazaadee nahin mil paati
 Ranveer Singh, a potato farmer from Agra's Kirawali village, has not had a good experience either
 ek badi retail company ne unase pichhali baar 640 ru
 Bought potatoes per quintal while the price in the mandi was Rs 600
 prati quintal
 but! The company took only better potatoes
 nateezaah bahut sara aalu chantni main nikal gaya
 When he was sold in the market he got half the price
 ranvir singh kehete hai, ''company ko bechney se hamen koi phayda na hua, kyonki chante hue aalu kii mujhe aadhi keemat hi mili jabaki mandi main sabhi grad kaa aalu ek hi keemat par aasaani se bik jaataa he
 "now the question arises that what did farmers like Ranveer Singh benefit from domestic or foreign direct investment in the retail sector? 51 percent in multi-brand and 100 percent foreign direct investment in single brand by the UPA government on the green flag There was a lot of riot in the arena
 maukey kii najaakat bhaanpate hue sarkaar ne is prastaav ko philhal thande baste main daal diya he
 However, the Congress Party is consistently calling this investment a revolutionary initiative in the interest of farmers
 lekin maje kii baat he ki epadi ke is puure vivaad main kisaan kaaphi udasin rahe
 By the way, Sharadkari Sangathan president and former Rajya Sabha MP Sharad Joshi says, "all the mainstream farmer organizations are in favor of foreign direct investment

 Because their link at the lower level is not well
 ve khet se mandi tak kii prakriya se khud ko jodne kii bajaae bichauliyon ke jariye sidhe mandi par nirbhar ho jaati hai
 In fact, companies are easier to buy from middlemen than to build collection centers and network of employees to buy goods from different places
 reliance retail ke korporate communication ke pravaktaa (naam kii bajaae itnaa hi chhapane par jor) apana paksh rakhte hai: ''retail sector kholane se sabhi kshetron ko majbootee milegi
 If rules and regulations are formed then the infrastructure and supply chain for organized retail will get a boost
 chote aapurtikartaaon, upabhoktaaon or kisaanon ke liye yah phydemand he
 In the current model, Reliance did not consider it appropriate to give any answer to the question of the benefits of the farmers
 lekin kamobesh sabhi companiyaan maanati hai ki unke liye har kisaan tak pahunchnaa sambhav nahin kyonki abhi yah kaam bahut chote str par he or is maamle main kisaanon ke liye khud sarkaar ko kadam uthaanaa chahie
 Future Group's Big Bazaar also purchases from Mandi to a large extent
 lekin group ke sansthaapak or siio kishor biani kehete hai, ''hamane gaanvon main kai collection centre kholkar kisaanon se sidhaa sampark banane kii koshish kii he
 India is a country with a large population and much remains to be done here
 '' biani gharelu companiyon kii naakaami kii daleel se sahamat nahin
 According to him, "there is a need for massive infrastructure in the country to maintain the purity and quality of food products and to prevent them from getting spoiled
" '' ve epadi ke aane se kisaanon ke jivan main bade badlaav ke sawaal ko taal jate hai
 Not only private companies, companies like the government sector also buy from the market
 haalanki madar deyari-safal ke bijness head (horticulture) pradipt kumaar sahu kehete hai, ''ham 80 fisadi maal kisaanon se kharidte hai
 We are on the verge of success after 25 years of struggle, while private companies are still struggling
 '' ve kehete hai, ''nijee companiyaan mandi se maal kharidkar safal nahin ho saktin
 "but the way companies like Reliance, Big Bazaar give the market rate to the farmers, the success is also on the same path
" safal ke pratinidhi rojaanaa mandi kaa bhav pataa karte hai or usamen se mandi kar ko ghataakar maal kharidne ke duusare din kisaanon ke bank khate main paisa transfar kar diya jaataa he
 The existing system does not seem to benefit small farmers much

 But instead of selling it directly to the traders, they are at the shop of Aadhati Lala Omprakash and point to talk to them

 Don't know about the companies, we only give our goods to them
 '' chand khan jaise zyaadaatar chote kisaanon kii yahi mushkil he ki ve sidhe apana maal nahin bech paa rahe
 On the other hand, while selling the goods of the farmer, the local merchants and retail companies sell them to the companies with 5-10% commission
 yani mandi main 5 ru
 The coriander sold by the kg reaches 20 to 50 rupees
 kilo ho jaataa he
 Small farmers do not benefit from this
 sahibabad mandi ho chaahe gajipur yaa phir ajadpur, kisaan tadake 6 baje se pehle hi apana maal achhatiyon ko saunpkar nikal jate hai or iske baad shuru hota he munaafe kaa asli khel

 After going to the mandi, the farmers have no option but to sell their goods to the jobber
 kai baar to kisaan kii upaj ko bazaar main manda bataakar aadhati usase oune-paune daam main kharid letaa he or baad main zyada munafa lekar bech detaa he
 What should the farmer do? Anyone from the center of the jobber or retail company has to sell his goods soon
 jo mil jaae, usee main santosh kar maal bech detaa he kisaan
 According to the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice, the condition of the farmers is extremely worrying because in India since 1995, about one and a half lakh small farmers have been forced to commit suicide

 In such a situation, what is the basis of the expectation of relief from foreign companies? The manager of a Delhi-based Reliance Fresh store advocates foreign direct investment: "when companies jump into the retail business, demand for goods will increase and competition will only benefit farmers
" '' lekin sawaal he ki gharelu companiyaan aisa karne main naakaam kyon hai?philhal, mandi se maal kharidne vaali companiyaan gaanv ke kisaanon se bhi apni sahajata ke hisaab se mandi rate par hi maal kharidti hai
 Overall, farmers have to go to the mandi refuge
 agra main big bazaar ke manager kehete hai, ''ham subjiyan sidhe mandi se laate hai
 Our employees go to Mandi and shop with the contractor and by eight o'clock in the morning the goods arrive in the store
 '' unke mutabik, mandi se subjiyan laana kisaanon se sidhi kharid ke mukaable behad aasaan he
 The manager of Easy Day also prefers to bring vegetables from the market
 haalanki agra main reliance ke ek pratinidhi kehete hai, ''ham kisaanon se sidhe aalu kharidte hai or unhen bazaar bhav diya jaataa he
 "reliance's state mentor Sanjeev Arora in Madhya Pradesh calls direct procurement from Reliance a prosperous step for farmers

 In such a situation, it does not seem logical to say Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at the Youth Congress of Delhi Conference on 29 November 2011 that "this investment will benefit the farmers, small retail businesses and the entire country
" hamen aadhunik takanic milegi
 In fact, the farmers express their displeasure with the existing mandi-arhati system
 unka maananaa he ki companiyon ne mandi kii hi vyavastha apana lee he
 Expressing displeasure over the attitude of the companies, Someshwar Patel, who recently retired from the position of chairman of the Indore Mandi Board, says, "the farmer is getting a sense of the market
" nijee companiyaan apane munaafe ke liye bazaar ko prabhavit karti hai or jarurat kii subjiyon kaa stock kar bazaar main kami paidaa kii jaati he
 The farmer does not understand the tricks of big companies

 FICCI Assistant General Secretary and Head of Retail Affairs Sameer Barde also believes that there is potential for exploitation of farmers in the mandi system
 ve kehete hai, ''companiyon ko kisaanon ke paas jaakar kharidne kii chhot honi chahie
 But not all states have fully implemented the APMC (agriculture Produce Marketing) Act, a model created by the Center
 '' pratyaksh videshi nivesh kii pairvi karte hue burde kisaanon ke saamne nahin aane par kehete hai, ''yah aisa kshetra he jo sangathit nahin he

 But the opposition disagrees

 nadda ise chote kisaanon ke hit main nahin maanate
 According to him, "when domestic retail companies are not successful, how will foreign retail chains be successful?" To hide their inaction, the government is opening the way for foreign companies, which will invest in the beginning, but later the farmers will be exploited
 ''ahm sawaal yah he ki jab kisaanon ko raahat dene ke liye centre sarkaar apane banaae model apiemasi act ko takreeban ek dashak main bhi lagu karne par rajyon ko raji nahin kar pai, to pratyaksh videshi nivesh aane ke baad kisaanon ko mandi ke achhatiyon ke jaal se nikaalkar sidhaa phayda kaise pahunchaaya ja saktaa he? mandi ho yaa company, kisaanon se kharid main bichauliyon kii hi mouj dikh rahi he
 Whereas due to agriculture being in the state list, in 2003, the central government had handed over the model act to the states to free them from middlemen
 abhi tak 35 main se sirf 17 rajyon-centreshasit pradeshon ne hi apiemasi act main badlaav kiya he
 But no one has implemented it completely
 haalanki jahaan kanoon badla he, vahaan kisaanon se sidhi kharid main bhi kisaanon ko kam, companiyon ko zyada phayda he kyonki yahaan bhi mandi kaa hi rate diya jaataa he
 If farmers are given a price by adding benefits to the total cost of the produce, a better retail chain can be created by eliminating the difference in prices from farm to plate
 jab khet se niklaa sasta maal bazaar main kai guna zyada daam par bikega to kisaan ke man main niraashaa jarur paidaa hogi
 Apparently, small farmers do not think the existing retail chain is a profitable deal, how can companies be expected to revolutionize the lives of farmers with the aim of making profits after FDI approval, whereas even today farmers both In the kind of arrangement, it is dependent on the market only

 Let's know what 
 
 - hanuman ji ko chola chadhaane se pehle swayan snaan kar shuddh ho jaaen or saaf vastra dhaaran karen
 Wearing only red colored dhoti would be better
 chola chadhaane ke liye chameli ke tel kaa upyog karen
 Also, while offering Chola, place a lamp in front of Hanuman ji
 deepak main bhi chameli ke tel kaa hi upyog karen
 - After offering the chola, garland roses of Hanuman ji and sprinkle the perfume of Kevade on both the shoulders of the idol of Hanuman ji
 ab ek saabut paan kaa patta len or iske upar thodaa gud va chanaa rakh kar hanuman ji ko bhoga lagaaein
 After offering bhoga, sit for a while at the same place and chant the mantra written below with a basil garland
 kam se kam 5 maala jaap avashya karen

 - hanuman ji ko chadaaye gaye gulab ke phool kii maala se ek phool tod kar use ek laal kapade main lapet kar apane dhan sthaan yani tijori main rakhen
 With this, the problem of solving money will start forming

 Only cattha, gulkand, fennel, copra ki badan and suman katari were put in this paan
 panbanavaate samay is baat kaa dhyaan rakhen ki usamen chuunaa evam supaari nahin ho
 There should also be no tobacco in this drink
 - har samasya kaa nivaaran he ram raksha strot paath-subah snaan aadi karne ke baad kisi hanuman mandir main jaaen or ram raksha strot kaa paath karen
 After this, offer jaggery and gram to Lord Hanuman
 jivan main yadi koi samasya he, to uskaa nivaaran karne ke liye prarthana karen
 - Hanuman ji will be pleased with mustard oil lamp - On the evening of Hanuman Ashtami, go to a Hanuman temple near and burn a mustard oil and a pure ghee Kadipakka in front of Hanuman ji's statue
 iske baad vahiin baithkar hanuman chalisa kaa paath karen
 This is a surefire way to get Hanuman's grace
 - bargad ke pattey kaa khaas upaay-shanivaar kii subah snaan karne ke baad bad (bargad) ke ped kaa ek patta toden or ise saaf svachh pani se dho len

 There is a Rajya Sabha member who contested and lost three days ago against the Chief Minister's party
 ye donon ek alag kamare main baithe hai
 The leaders of two middle lines of an opposing party are busy discussing why Gogoi is still the best bet for the state
 guwahati ke rajeev bhawan main chunavi ranneeti par teen ghante chali marathon baithak se laute 80 baras ke mukhyamantri takreeban do ghante se intjaar kar rahe logon ko niraash nahin karte
 There is no trace of fatigue on his face

 In between the conversations, they also take a look at the program of three days of campaigning in Barak Valley and their home region Titabor
 gogoi kehete hai, “pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhale hi mujhe bahut buudhe aadmi ke taur par pesh karne kii koshish kii ho, magar assam ke logon kii khatir kaam karne ke liye mujhamen bahut urja he
 i am still young at heart

 "it is this ability to mix serious things with light things that has made him a Belaus election campaigner
 isi ke dam par ve pichley 15 saal se assam ke matadaataaon ke laadle bane hue hai
 But the 2016 war seems difficult for them

 The BJP was marginalized in 2006 and 2011 and the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) was out of favor
 agypi main nai jaan foonki ja saki he yaa nahin, yah to khayr bahes kaa vishay he
 But after the success of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and the 2015 municipal elections, the BJP has emerged as a major threat to the Gogoi era in Assam
 kabhi unke bharosmand sahyogi or 2001 se congress kii harek jeet ke mukhya shilpi rahe hemanth biswa sarama paala badalakar bijepi ke kheme main chale gaye hai
 His mastery also appeared in the Pachamel coalition, in which he brought the BJP, AGP, BPF and other tribal parties under one umbrella
 isse congress or 2005 main alpsankhyak musalamaanon ke hiton kii hifaazat ke liye banaai gai party ol india united democratic front (eiudief) alag-thalag pad gaye hai
 It is the AIUDF that will decide whether Gogoi returns to power for the fourth time
 2005 main us vakt agypi ke saansad sarbanand sonoval kii yachika par supreme court ne vivaadaaspad gaiyr-kanoonee apravasi (nyaayaadhikaran dwaara nirdhaaran) kanoon ko radd kar diya tha
 The majority of Assam's population had welcomed the decision, but it created fear among a section of the Muslim population
 unhen lagane laga tha ki ab unhen gaiyr-kanoonee apravasi qaraar de diya jayega
 Taking advantage of this fear, Badruddin Ajmal, the perfume businessman, founded AIUDF and seized a large section of the Congress's Muslim supporters
 2006 main isane vidhansabha kii 10 siten jeetin thim, jinhen 2011 main party ne 18 par pahunchaa diya or sabase badi vipakshi party ban gai
 Actually, before the election of Bihar, the political pundits of Assam were predicting it to win 30 seats in this election
 magar bihar ke baad party ke samarthan main giravat ai he jisaki kai vajahen hai
 Says Nani Gopal Mahant, Associate Professor at Guwahati University, "after Bihar, the Congress is seen as a better force to counter the bjp's Hindutva agenda
 duusare, ashishnutaa ko lekar chal rahi bahason ke dauraan ajmal kii khamoshi bhi eiudief ke khilaaf gai
 a senior party leader claims that many sitting mlas will lose their seats due to anti-incumbency trends
 apane buniyadi himytiyon ke bich party kii lokapriyata main giravat ko bhaanpakar ajmal congress ke saath gathbandhan karnaa chaahate the or bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne unke bich samjhauta karwaane kii peshkash bhi kii
 The Congress high command also wanted an alliance with the AIUDF to unite Muslim votes, but Gogoi stood as a wall against the alliance
 siyasat ke manje hue khilaadi gogai jaanate hai ki eiudief ke saath chunaav-purv gathbandhan se hindu or janajaatiy matadaata bijepi ke haq main fouran ekajute ho jaaenge
 But the bigger screws got stuck with the number of seats that AIUDF was demanding
 ajmal se haath nahin milaane kii gogoi kii ranneeti to baad main soch-vichaar par saamne ai
 Shortly after the Bihar election results, Gogoi offered a mahabuzabuji (grand alliance) of all non-bjp parties including AGP, AIUDF and former ally BPF, but failed
 gogoi ke mahabujabuji formule ko apanaakar congress or eiudief ke khilaaf gathbandhan banane vaale sarama kehete hai, “gogoi or ajmal ke bich pakke taur par talmail he or assam ko is napak santhganth se bachaane ke liye ham koi kasar nahin chodenge
 How can we allow Bahirgat like Ajmal to gain political power? " Gogoi held several rounds of meetings with Nitish Kumar's chief strategist Prashant Kishore
 magar donon kai muddon par rajamand nahin ho sake or bataaya jaataa he ki kishor ne gogoi ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaae rakhane ke khilaaf congress alaakaman ko aagaah bhi kar diya
 After being rebuked by Kishore and other parties, the Chief Minister decided to go to the polls on her own
 unhone india today se kaha, “congress phir 75 siten jeetegi
 “for three consecutive terms, the Chief Minister is unaware of the challenge being faced by BJP MP and tribal leader Kamakhya Prasad Tasa himself this time in his constituency
 jorhat main unhone reportron se kaha, “is baar to main or bhi kam chunaav prachaar kar rahaa hum
 "gogoi's strategy for accomplishing Mission 75 is simple: to project himself as the land son of Assam directly against Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 unke mutabik, modi “hindutv kii ashishnu takaton kii numaaindgi karte hai, jinhen assam kii saanskrithik or jaateey vividhta kii koi samaj nahin he

 '' ayodhya kii vivaadit jameen ko lekar supreme court kaa bahupra tikshit faisla aane ke baad soshal media par bhagwaan ram, sita or lakshmana kii do tasviren viral ho rahi hai
 It is claimed that these photos are of idols who were taken from Ayodhya to South India for safe keeping before the Mughal emperor Babur's Ram Janmabhoomi was desecrated
 is daawey main aage kaha ja rahaa he ki ek swami ne in murtiyon ko harihar main tungabhadra nadi ke narayan ashram rakhaa, jo ki aaj karnataka main he
 Since then, these idols are being worshiped here
 ab in murtiyon ko bhagwaan kii ram janmabhumi ayodhya main waapas laayaa jayega
 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found that both of these photos going viral are from Shri Sadguru Samarth Narayan Maharaj Ashram located in Harihar town of Davanagere district, Karnataka
 haalanki, is baat kaa koi vishwasaneey pramaan nahin he jisase ye sthapit ho ki ye tasviren babar ke hamale ke pehle ayodhya se laai gai thim
 The claim being made with these pictures is also being forwarded on whatsapp
 kai soshal media yugers ne isefesbucauratviterper bhi share kiya he
 During the AFWA investigation we found that both the photographs used in the post are in the photo gallery of Kannada Times
 kannada times ke mutabik, ye tasviren harihar sthi t shri sadguru samarth narayan maharaj ashram kii hai, inhen chinmay em raav ne khinchaa he
 AFWA researched more about these photos: The first photo can be seen in this photo that the idol of Lord Rama, Lakshmana and Sita is made of a metal
 hamane narayan ashram kii varking cameti ke sadsy purushotm gupta se sampark kiya
 He informed that 'these idols are brought out in the hall area of the ashram for public darshan and worship during the festival
 sambhavat: ye murtiyon 70 se 80 saal puraani hai
 The claim with the photo that they are brought from Ayodhya is not correct
 'hamane karnataka uniwarsity ke itihaas or puraatatv vibhaag ke ritred professor ashok shettar ko bhi ye tasviren dikhain
 He also said that the claim being made with the photographs was false that these photos were brought from Ayodhya
 hamane ayodhya ke ram mandir main court dwaara adhikrut pujari satyedra das se bhi is bare main baat kii, jinhone aisi kisi kahani ke bare main jaankaree hone se inkaar kiya
 He told that the Ram Janmabhoomi temple is dedicated to 'ram Lala', which means Ram in the form of Baal
 isliye aapako vivaadit sthal par bane tambu main bhagwaan ram, lakshmana, bharat or shatrughna kii murtiyon milengi, lekin vahaan sita kii murti nahin he
 He argued that since the viral photo also has a statue of Sita, it is unlikely to be from Ayodhya
 duusari photois photo main dekha ja saktaa he ki bhagwaan ram, lakshmana or sita kii murti kaale pathar kii bani he
 Purushottam Gupta, a member of the working committee of the ashram, told us in this regard that 'after the court's decision on Ayodhya some locals have started to believe that these idols have been brought from Ayodhya
 haalanki, isse judaa koi pramaan nahin he
 These idols are later and kept in the sanctum sanctorum of the ashram
 'india today ne daavangere ke patrkaar mohammad nazeer se baat kii, jinhone bataaya ki ayodhya par supreme court kaa faisla aane ke pehle hamane yah kahani kabhi nahin suni thi
 He said, "after the court's decision in Davanagere here, people have started to believe that the stone idols have been brought from Ayodhya
 chunki donon hi tasviren ek hi sthaan se hai, isliye soshal media yugers dhaatu kii murtiyon kii tasveeron ke saath bhi vahi daawa kar rahe hai
 'we spoke to the District Magistrate of Davanagere, Mahantesh Belagi, who said that people have a renewed interest in the stone sculptures, so they are planning to get the historians and people of the archeology department to investigate it
 in pathar kii murtiyon ke bare main ayodhya ke mahant satyendra das ne hamen bataaya ki chunki ve kuch puraani dikh rahi hai lekin yah kahana kathin he ki ye murtiyon ram janmabhumi se harihar laai gai hai
 Conclusion On the basis of these facts, India Today concludes that there is a debate about the stone idols that they may be the real idols of Ayodhya, but since both the idols belong to the same ashram, people will be united with both Are claiming kuch log dhaatu ke murti kii bhi tasviir share karke daawa kar rahe hai ki ve babar ke mandir giraane se pehle surakshit rakhane ke liye ayodhya se laai gai thim
 However, till now we have not found any evidence to prove that these idols were brought from Ayodhya hundreds of years ago
 yah bhi gaur karne kii baat he ki yah post supreme court ke ayodhya vivaad par faisle ke baad viral hona shuru hui he
 However, until an official report is given by an archaeological expert on the matter, it is difficult to dismiss this claim

 # biggboss # bb13 # biggboss— drakesis🍒 (@drakesis_)october 13, 2019 Vinod Kumar, candidate of Aam Aadmi Party's Pathankot constituency in Punjab, has made serious allegations against his own party leaders Durgesh Pathak and Sanjay Singh
 vinod kumaar ne chandigarh main press conference karke yah kaha ki unka naam aam aadmi party ke dwaara jari kii gai ummidavaaron kii teesri list main he
 On November 12, he was summoned to the house of Aam Aadmi Party leader Aman Arora in Sector 18, Chandigarh, where Sanjay Singh, Durgesh Pathak and a few other observers from Delhi were present to spend Vinod Kumar one crore rupees in the election
 Instructed to submit to the party
 jab vinod kumaar ne unase poocha kii aam aadmi party to kahati he ki bina paise ke hi chunaav ladenge or jeetenge to yah ek karod rupaya jamaa karwaane kii kya jarurat he, to is par sanjay singh or durgesh pathak ne usko party ke niyamon ke mutabik yah paisa jamaa karwaane kaa nirdesh diya
 Vinod Kumar further alleged that he refused to deposit this one crore rupees and said that he is a minor journalist and cannot deposit that much money
 mujhe paisa jamaa karwaane ko kahajisake baad durgesh pathak or sanjay singh main unki baat phone par dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal se karwaai or kejariwal ne bhi vinod kumaar ko durgesh pathak or sanjay singh ke nirdesh ke mutabik paise jamaa karwaane ke liye kaha or in donon kii baat maanane kaa nirdesh diya
 Vinod Kumar said that he became more upset after that
 sanjay singh or durgesh pathak ne kaha ki agar vah ek karod rupaya jamaa nahin karvaa sakate to wo unase 30 lakh rupye le len or ek press conference kar ke paariwarik majaburi kaa hawala dekar boha vidhansabha kshetra se ummidavaar ke taur par apana naam waapas le len
 Did not meet Kejriwal, according to Vinod Kumar, Sanjay Singh and Durgesh Pathak said that after this the party will give ticket to someone from there who can spend so much money in the election
 vinod kumaar kaa kahana tha ki us din ke baad se vah kaaphi pareshaan the unhone punjab daure par aae arvind kejariwal se kai baar milane kii koshish kii lekin arvind kejariwal se milanaa behad hi mushkil tha or unki mulaakaat arvind kejariwal se nahin ho saki
 After this, in a press conference in Chandigarh, he appealed to other such candidates of the party not to deposit Rs 1 crore with the party and said that he is still a candidate from the Aam Aadmi Party's Boha assembly constituency if the party wants him Remove the party, but as long as he is in the party, he will try to contest on behalf of the party and if the party shows him the way out So he would independent candidate
 chhotepur se koi lenaa dena nahinvinod kumaar se poocha gaya ki kya unke paas in aaropon ko lekar koi pukhta saboot he to unka kahana tha ki 12 november ko jab unki sanjay singh or durgesh pathak ke saath meeting hui tab unka mobile phone pehle hi sanjay singh ne apane paas rakh liya tha
 Vinod Kumar was also asked if he was saying such a thing in the pressure of the party's ousted AAP leader Sucha Singh Chhotepur of Punjab, then he said that he has nothing to do with Chotepur but Sucha Singh Chotepur too The exit from the party is shown incorrectly
 vinod kumaar ne yah bhi kaha ki aam aadmi party apane siddhanton se bhatak chuki he or punjab ke paise vaale aise log jo ki tikat chaahate hai unako dekhakar party ke andar bhrashtachar bhar chukaa he
 "fleming will make the job a little easier," he said
 vah saat saal tak siesake main mere saath rahe
 He works with my kind patience and is fully committed
 puraani chah timen sthapit hai or unhone nilaamee main apni jarurat ke anusaar kuch khilaadiyon ko kharida he, lekin unke mukhya khilaadi pehle se unke saath jude hai, jisase ve shuruyaat main behatar sthiti main hongi
 Dhoni said, both the new teams selected five players out of the draft
 baaki do tiimon ko ab apane khilaadiyon ke bich saamanjasy baithaana hoga
 Which players will play which role has to be seen
 ho saktaa he antarrashtriya cricket main duusare yaa tisare number par khilne vaale ko paanchaven number par khelnaa pade
 We will have to assess it after a few matches and see which areas are the problem and change accordingly
 dhoni ne kaha, donon nai tiimon ne draft main se paanch-paanch khilaadiyon ko chunaa
 The remaining two teams will now have to adjust between their players
 koun se khilaadi koun si bhoomika nibhaayenge ise dekhnaa hoga
 It is possible that a player who plays second or third in international cricket will have to play at number five
 hamen kuch maichon ke baad iskaa akalan karnaa hoga or dekhnaa hoga ki kin kshetron main samasya he or uske anusaar badlaav karnaa hoga

 ICSSR President BB Kumar told PTI, "the practice of migrant Indian men coming to their country to marry is very old but such marriages are not always successful
 aise bahut se maamle hai jab duulhe ne apni dulhan ko yahaan chhod diya yaa apane bare main galat jaankaree di
 "what are the benefits of having sex during the period? She told, but we do not have any research that shows how many such marriages happened in the country and what is the status of these marriages after a few years
" un ladakiyon kaa kya hua jinke saath enarai dulhan banane ke bahaane dhokhaa hua? kya hamen kade maandand kii jarurat he? in sari baton kaa adhyayan kiye jane kii jarurat he
 When the North American student was sentenced by North Korea to 15 years, the Research Council has not yet approved this research project and the subject is being investigated
 kumaar ne bataaya ki jaise hi isaki vyaavhaarikta kaa adhyayan or is sambandh main praarambhik samagriyaan uplabdh ho jaati hai, yah project manjuur kar diya jayega or isse judaa kaam shuru ho jayega
 Despite the woman's refusal, the actor attempted to have sex, Kumar said, "why are parents attracted to migrant grooms?" Apart from the fancy lifestyle abroad, what other things do they consider? How will we verify the information? All these factors will also be assessed during research

 The dream of Digital India cannot be fulfilled as long as India remains at the bottom of the list of Internet and connectivity
 slo internet speed kharaab connactivity kii vajah se kai pareshaaniyaan hai
 You must have known about wifi, but now you should also know about the life
 lifi ek aisi takanic he jo connactivity ke maamle main wifi se sau guna zyada he
 Actually it works with the help of LED bulb
 is takanic ke tahat aapke ghar main lagaaya gaya elidi balb bhi hai speed data transmit karegaa or iske liye use wifai yaa broadband kii jarurat bhi nahin hogi
 According to the report, the Indian government is testing this technology so that it can be used
 ET kii ek report ke mutabik haal hi main IT mantralay ne lifi (light fidelity) ko payalat project ke taur par test kiya he
 It uses LED bulb and light spectrum to transmit data at a speed of 10gbps
 isaki connactivity kii range bhi wifai kii tulana main zyada he
 Usually you can connect a room or an article via wifi, but the radius of lifi is up to 1 km
 chunki bharat main abhi har jagah fibre bicha kar connactivity dene main kaaphi samasyaayein hai or isamen kaaphi samay bhi legaaga
 In such a situation, the government would like to provide connectivity in areas where it is difficult to provide connectivity through fiber
 mantrayal ke andar aane vaale adukeshan and research network ke diarector general nina pahuja ne ET se kaha he, ‘lifi kaa sabase bada istemaal aane vaale samay main desh ke smart cities main kiya ja sakegaa
 Its theme will be Internet of Things for Modern Cities and it can be connected to led'is LIFI technology uses Visible Light Communication (VLC) for internet connectivity through this technology through which its connectivity speed lab registered 1gbps Has been, which is 100 times more than the common wifi
 2015 ke aakhir main is takanic ko pehali bartesting lab se baahar prayog kiya jahaan isaki connactivityspid 1gbps test kii gai
 It is worth noting that most common wifi routers have connectivity speeds of 100mbps
 ise 'internet' kii speed naa samajhen, yah connactivity speed he
 Many times people forget to understand the connectivity speed of the device as internet speed
 udhaaharan ke taur par wifai router kii connactivity speed 100mbps hoti he jiskaa matlab, router se aapkaa smartphone yaa laptop 100mbps speed se conect ho rahaa he
 While internet speed is what service providers give you
 vaise hi li-fi kii 1gbps speed ko internet speed naa samajhen, kyonki yah router se aapke divaais ke bich kii connactivity kii speed he, jisase aapke internet speed par zyada fark nahin padegaa
 It will be beneficial in office and local networking
 If this technology starts then it will benefit greatly in local networking where all the computers are connected to the local wifi network
 Estonian company ke siio deepak solanki ne ek angreji akhbaar ko bataaya ' ham kai industries main is takanic kii testing ke liye payalat project chalaa rahe hai, taaki is vielsi takanic ko yuj kiya ja sake'sicyor conection ke liye phydemandais takanic se sicyor network banane main bhi madad milegi kyonki wifai kii tarah iske signal diwaar ko paar nahin kar sakate hai
 For example, if it is installed in a room, then its signals will not go out of that room, which will make its connectivity even stronger and safer
 yahi vajah he ki lifike jariye lab main 224gbps maximum speed se data travel karaayaa gaya
 The counsel of Bollywood actor Salman Khan, who filed an appeal against the five-year sentence in the 2002 hit and run case, told the Bombay High Court on Tuesday that the statements of the prosecution witnesses are contradictory and unreliable

 Shambhulal Rager, who made a live video by killing a Muslim man in Rajsamand, Rajasthan, has again released a hat video from inside the jail
 jodhpur central jail main band shambhulaal kaa yah video teji se viral ho rahaa he, jiske baad jail prashasan main hadakamp machaa hua he
 In two videos made inside the jail, Shambhulal has again spoken fiercely about hate hatred and made inflammatory statements
 saath hi usne jail ke hi ek kaidi se khud kii jaan ko khatra bhi bataaya he
 The jail administration searched the barracks after the video surfaced, but did not obtain the mobile from which the video was filmed
 shambhulaal kii suraksha bhi badha di gai he
 Since the Rajsamand massacre, Shambhulal is lodged in Jodhpur Central Jail
 shambhulaal ke donon nae video ravivaar kii shaam soshal network par share kiye gaye
 In these videos, he is seen saying that he is in danger of life from a prisoner named Vasudev who is in jail
 uskaa kahana he ki vasudev kuch din pehle uske paas aayaa or usase dosti badhaane kii koshish kii
 Shambhulal says that Vasudev, who is on the charge of illegal trade in drugs, is from Bengal and wants to kill him
 iske baad vah kahata dikh rahaa he ki vah marane se nahin darataa or jehad desh ke liye khatarnaak he
 At the same time, Shambhulal has also accused the West Bengal government that Jihad is dangerous for the country and the Bengal government is not paying attention to it
 uskaa kahana he ki desh main kai jehadi farji naam-pate se jehad failaa rahe hai
 Love wanted to hide the crime under the guise of Jihad, in the videos, Shambhujambhulal has accused Pakistan and Bangladesh of spreading conspiracy against India
 uskaa kahana he ki vah hindu auraton ko lekar jehadi tippanee karne se krodhit ho gaya tha or isiilie usne bengal ke rahane vaale muslim vyakti kii hatya kii thi
 It is clear from the video that Shambhulal has no regrets for his crime so far
 vah kah bhi rahaa he ki use muslim vyakti kii hatya kaa koi afsos nahin he or usne jo kiya sahi kiya he
 After the new video of Shambhulal went viral, DIG Vikram Singh of the jail said that the matter is very serious and since late night the jail administration is engaged in investigating the case
 unhone bataaya ki kuch din pehle shambhulaal ko mandir jane kii ijaajat di gai thi or puri sambhaavna he ki usee samay use kisi ne mobile de diya ho
 Vikram Singh says that he has got some important clues in this regard
 saath hi unhone yah aashwaasan bhi diya ki shaam tak video banane ke liye istemaal mobile baraamad kar liya jayega
 The murder was not due to love jihad, because of the illicit relationship
 In the first week of December last year, Shambhulal allegedly attacked and killed a Muslim laborer living in Bengal on the charges of love jihad with a sharp weapon and burnt alive by pouring petrol
 Had given
 usne hatya kii is puri ghatana kaa apane naaballig bhattije ke jariye video bhi banaaya tha or muslim samudaay ko lav jehad se dur rahane kii dhamkee bhi di thi
 The case caught quite a lot at that time
 kai hinduvadi sanghathanon ne dharna pradarshan kiya or jamkar hangaamaa bhi kiya
 Not only this, lakhs of rupees were also transferred to Shambhu's wife's bank account through donations, so that Shambhu's case would be fought with a big lawyer
 jaanch ke dauraan baad main khulaasa hua ki shambhulaal ne lav jehad ke chakkar main nahin, balki avaidh sambandhon ke chalate hatya kii thi

 unhone 'rob report limited adishan-2018' kaarykram main apane safar ke bare main baatcheet kii or kai saare sawaalon ke jawaab die
 When asked at the program, "tibetans are living on the Himalayas after leaving the bank post, how do they apply the things they learned while being bankers", they said, "I have never been able to do all that i have been able to do today
" main naa charity bana paati or naa hi kitaaben likh paatin

 main naa angreji sikh paati or naa hi tibeti
 Now i can talk to people everywhere
 isse mujhe madad milti he
 Many people have hesitated, but i am confident because of my background

 When will you feel absolutely free? kya aapako kabhi lagata he ki bas ab main santusht hum? agar nahin to main aapke liye prarthana karuungi
