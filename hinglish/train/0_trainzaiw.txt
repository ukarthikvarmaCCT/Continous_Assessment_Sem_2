 Amit Shah defended the decision to give ticket to Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, accused of Malegaon blast from Bhopal Lok Sabha seat and said that Sadhvi Pragya has got a clean chit in the fake case named Hindu Terror
 bataa den ki isse pehle vipaksh ke hamalavar tevar ko dekhte hue piem modi ne bhi sadhvi pragna kaa bachaav kiya tha or kaha ki vah un logon ke liye ‘pratik' hai jinhone hinduon ko aatankwaadi bataaya tha
 PM Modi said that Pragya will give a tough challenge to the Congress there
 pragna thakur ko madhya pradesh kii bhopal seat se congressi netaa digvijay singh ke khilaaf chunavi maidan main utaara gaya he
 Addressing a press conference in West Bengal, Amit Shah said that as far as Sadhvi Pragya is concerned, i would like to say that a fake case was made in the name of Hindu Terror, the country's culture was maligned in the world, in court
 If the case went on, it was found to be fake
 unhone aage kaha ki sawaal ye he ki swami aseemanand or baaki logon ko aaropee banaakar farji cese banaaya to, samjhauta express main blast karne vaale log kahaan he, jo log pehle pakade gaye the, unhen kyon choda
 At the same time, Amit Shah also attacked the Congress President
 unhone kaha ki 'batla house kaa jab encounter hua, sonia ji ko ronaa aa gaya batla house ke antkavaadiyon ke marane par
 While one of his brave police inspectors was martyred there, his death did not weep, to which the Congress should respond
 'isse pehle pradhanmantri ne bhagava aatank sambandhi tippaniyon ko lekar congress par kataaksh karte hue kaha tha, ‘(pragna ko utaarne kaa) faisla un logon ko karaara jawaab he jinhone puure dharm or samskruti ko aatank se joda
 PM Modi said these things in an interview to "times Now" news channel

 Sadhvi Pragya made this remark on a TV channel during the campaign in Bhopal on Saturday and because of this once again the incident of Babri Masjid demolition has become fresh in political circles
 tivi channel se sadhvi pragna ne kaha tha, 'ram mandir nishchit rup se banaaya jayega
 It will be a grand temple
 ' yah puche jane par ki kya vah ram mandir banane ke liye samaysima bataa sakati hai, to pragna ne kaha, 'ham mandir kaa nirmaan karenge
 After all, we even went to demolish the structure (babri Masjid)
 ' sadhvi pragna ne babari masjid main apni ahm bhoomika par bhi prakaash daalaa or kaha, 'maine dhaanche par chadhakar todaa tha
 i am proud that God gave me opportunity and strength and i did it
 ab vahiin ram mandir banaaenge
 Earlier, BJP candidate from Bhopal Lok Sabha seat Sadhvi Pragya Thakur had made objectionable remarks on the then Mumbai ATS Chief Hemant Karkare during the recent 26 / 11 Mumbai attack
 media se baatcheet main unhone bataaya tha ki unhone karkare se kaha tha ki tumhaara sarvanaash hoga
 After this there was a lot of controversy over Pragya's comment

 Ekta says, i personally believe that if you want to watch sex, you can download it online for free through the internet

 uttar pradesh kii raajnneeti ke do bade diggaj mulaayam singh yadav or mayawati jab dashakon puraani dushmani bhulaakar mainpuri kii raily main ek hi manch par aae to unki tasviren khub viral huin dekhi gayi
 Having forgotten the enmity, the two leaders have now vowed to try to stop PM Modi in Uttar Pradesh
 in donon netaaon ko ek saath laane main mulaayam singh ke bete or uttar pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne kaa bada role rahaa he
 Samajwadi Party's Digital Cell claims that the joint rally of these two leaders broke all records in youtube
 lekin is sabake hote hue yah saaf nahin he ki mulaayam singh yadav or mayawati ne apane-apane coder or votero kojo ki ek duusare ke virdohi hai, unke bich ekta kaa kitna sandesh de paae hai,aisa lagata he ki kuch khaas nahin
 Looking at this whole incident, it seems that the old and respected leader Mulayam Singh Yadav agreed to come on the same platform in honor of Mayawati, despite the love and unwillingness of her son
 aaj se 24 saal pehle mulaayam singh yadav ke kaaryakartaaon ne hi guest house main mayawati par hamalaa kar diya tha
 Since then, the 'fierce rivalry' did not end even after the grand alliance between Mayawati and Mulayam's son
 aapako bataa den ki donon ke bich is takaraav kaa virodhiyon ne khub phayda uthaaya
 On the other hand, BJP President Amit Shah also felt that an alliance between the two parties would pose a major threat to the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 isko dekhte hue unhone 'amar singh ankal', akhilesh yadav ke dhur ban chuke unke chachaa shivpal yadav or unki nai party ko mahagathbandhan kaa khel bigaadane ke liye laga diya
 At the same time, the news is that Amit Shah has asked the people associated with the BJP IT cell to make the video very viral in which Akhilesh Yadav is allegedly seen raising his hand on his father
 haalanki video kii satyata kii pushti nahin hui he
 But still it is an order to promote it fiercely
 udhar pehle charan kii voting main mahagathbandhan ke achche pradarshan kii report milane ke baad akhilesh yadav ne 'ek bade dhakke' kii jarurat kii baat kahkar apane pita mulaayam singh yadav ko sanyukt raily ke liye raji kar liya
 It is also worth noting here that Mulayam Singh Yadav was not in favor of this alliance and often publicly condemned it many times
 iske saath hi andar hi andar shivpal ke saath milakar iske faisle khilaaf sajeesh rachaa
 At the same time, it seemed that on every issue in front of Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav himself had pulled back many steps and Mayawati was also praising him
 akhilesh yadav kii ore se 'buaa' ko die ja rahe sammaan ke charche bhi khub the
 Akhilesh Yadav gave the statement, 'mayawati's respect is now her honor'
 iske saath hi vah ab apane bhaashanon main mayawati ke sabase priy akaash anand kaa bhi zikr jarur karte hai
 This behavior of Akhilesh Yadav benefited from the fact that Mayawati also willingly agreed to hold a joint rally with Mulayam Singh Yadav
 vishleshkon kaa maananaa tha ki 7 charnon main uttar pradesh main bijepi ko phayda pahunchaayegi
 But in fact, Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav's alliance can get more benefit, as both are trying to be combined in all big areas
 apane votaron main lokapriy mulaayam singh yadav ne mainpuri kii raily main kaha ki samaajawaadee party ko mayawati kii izzat kerani chahie, kyonki vah hamaare bure vakt main saath khadi hai
 At the same time, Mayawati also praised Mulayam Singh Yadav more than PM Modi
 mulaayam singh yadav yah sunakar bhavuk ho gaye or unako dhanyavad diya
 Mayawati said, 'you have a good son, you have raised him well, he is like a' tiger balm 'for him
 ' mayawati kii yah baat aisi thi maanon vah guestaouse cond ke ghaavon par maraham laga rahi hai
 When he was attacked by SP men in 1995, he had to lock himself in a room
 is ghatana ke baad se hi mulaayam or mayawati ne ek duusare kaa cheharaa na dekhne kii kasam khai thi
 If i say the favorite 'burnall Movement' of an online supporter of BJP, then Akhilesh Yadav is like 'tiger Balm' for his enemies who need Burnall ' lakshith hamalon ke ek din baad pradhanmantri narendra modi ke mantrimandal kii suraksha samiti kii baithak main pakistan ke saath lagati antarrashtriya seemaa or niyantran rekha par aaj (shuukravaar) halaat kii samiksha karne kii sambhaavna he

 fasebuk par pyaar hua, ikraar hua lekin kabhi aamane-saamne mulaakaat nahin hui
 The result of love continued for two and a half years
 lekin kuch tha jo chipaaya ja rahaa tha
 When the fraud came to light, it became the cause of two deaths
 maamla madhya pradesh ke jabalpur kaa he
 Two and a half years later, a young man madly in love with a woman was found out through Facebook that his girlfriend was a mother of three children and a middle-aged woman
 jabalpur range ke police mahanireekshak upendra jain ne bataaya ki jyoti or vineet kii fasebuk par dosti hui thi
 He told that Jyoti had put a photo of a beautiful and young girl in place of her photo on Facebook, which Vineet became obsessed with
 pehle soshal netwarking site par hi dosti badi or dhire-dhire donon main pyaar ho gaya
 According to the police, on the call of Jyoti, Vineet came to Jabalpur with the excuse of looking for a job and reached Bhedaghat at 5 pm on Friday evening to meet Jyoti
 jyoti ne vineet ko canteen ke peeche bulaayaa or usne jab apni premika ko dekha to hairaan rah gaya
 She was 42 years old and also had three children
 vineet ne isaki kalpana nahin thi
 Seeing this, the anger became angry
 usne pehle mahila ke seene main najadik se goli markar kathith rup se uski hatya kar di or baad main khud ko usee pistaul se goli markar aatmahatya kar lee
 According to the police, 25-year-old Vineet Singh was a resident of village Bachanda Kajan in Muzaffarnagar, UP

 Sri Sri Ravi Shankar who is on the mediation front on the Ayodhya dispute is in full form these days
 ve lagaataar hindu-muslim netaaon se mulaakaat kar dashakon puraane is vivaad ko baatcheet ke jariye hal karne kii sambhaavnaaen tatol rahe hai
 However, the situation on their model of agreement on both sides is not yet clear
 aajtak
 in spoke to various Muslim leaders who met Ravi Shankar
 is baatcheet main saamne aayaa he ki shri shri ravishankar muslimon se samjhauta nahin, sarender kii ummid lagaae baithe hai
 If this is true, then the fate of this conversation can be thought of
 6 oktober ko bengaluru main shri shri ravishankar se mulaakaat karne valemuslim personal lau board ke sadsy ejaj arshad kaasmine kaha ki shrishri ravishankar madhyasthata kii baat to kar rahe hai, lekin samjhaute kaa koi model nahin pesh kar rahe
 The Muslim Personal Law Board has made it clear that if a model is presented, then only the negotiations can proceed
 kaasmi ne kaha ki ravishankar muslim samudaay ke un logon se bhi mil rahe hai, jinka ayodhya maamle se koi sidhaa taalluk nahin he
 Not only this, Shri Shree Ravi Shankar is meeting with the people of Shia Waqf Board and Rashtriya Muslim Manch to make the Muslim community relinquish its claim from the disputed place and subsequently take the place of building mosque elsewhere
 ye samjhauta nahin, balki sarender kaa model he
 Kamal Farooqui, a member of the Muslim Personal Law Board, said that Sri Sri wants a gift from the Ravi Shankarmuslim community to the mosque for Ram temple
 shrishri ravishankar pehle bhi madhyasthata ke liye muslim samudaay se mili the
 At that time it was his intention and it is the same today
 faruki ne kaha- hamane unase saaf kaha babari masjid koi saamaan yaa kisi kii nijee sampatti nahin he jo gift kar di jaae
 According to the Muslim Waqf Act, Waqf property can neither be sold nor gifted to anyone
 iske baad bhi ravishankar muslim samudaay se gift chaahate hai, jo naammumkin he
 Farooqui said that i told him that the Muslim side is of the opinion that whatever the decision of the Supreme Court is, we will accept it and you also agree
 babari masjid ection cameti ke sanyojak jafarayab jilani ne kaha ki shrishri ravishankar agar ye chaahate hai ki muslim pakshakaar masjid se apana haq chhod den to ye naammumkin he
 Mr
 Shri Ravi Shankar has not yet contacted the Muslim Personal Law Board
 unke paas koi model he to bataaen
 Surrender's talk about the Sri Sri's initiative by Muslim religious leaders is also strengthened by Mahant Derendra Das's statement of the party Nirmohi Akhara on the Ram temple issue
 ajtak ke khulaase main das ne kaha he ki ramamandir ke liye maanane par sunni vakf board ko 1 karod rupee se lekar 20 karod rupee tak die ja sakate hai
 However, Sri Sri himself is not speaking on the compromise or surrender dispute
 unhone apane paas koi model hone tak kii baat sweekaar nahin kii he
 They are constantly meeting religious leaders of both sides
 is pahal main unhen kitni kamyaabi milegi, ye agle kuch din main saaf ho jayega

 agar aapophiske kaaryon ko jarurat sejyadasmay de rahe hai to ye mat sochie ki aapke liye ye plus point he yaa aisa karne se aap khud ko kaabil sabit kar paaenge
 In fact, overworked can also prove to be a negative point for you
 jaaniye aakhir kyon offis main jarurat se zyada kaam nahin karnaa chahie
 - a good employee is the one who comes at the office time and ends the office at the right time and goes home
 -companyese logon ko smart varkar nahin maanati, jo tay samay seemaa ke bheetar apana kaam nahin kar pate
 Therefore, giving more time to your office does not define you as hardworking
 - aap chaahe apni marji se offis ke kaam ko extra samay den par is laalach main naa rahen ki offis aapako uske extra paise degaa
 If you do this, then you will be responsible for your deteriorated health
 - agar aap offis kaa kaam ghar le jaakar kar rahe hai to ye samajha jaataa he ki aapmen time management kii kami he or aap dhimaa kaam karte hai
 - Sitting in the office every day for a long time also proves that you do not work
 - jab aap offis main jarurat se zyada samay dene lagate hai to log ye bhi maan lete hai ki aapaki personal life thik nahin chal rahi he
 MNS President Raj Thackeray has started to fire again and this time also the North Indian autowires are on target
 pehle raaj ne dhamkee di or kuch ghanton ke baad hi unke kuch samarthakon ne gundgardee karte hue saream ek auto ko jala diya jabaki duusare main todphod kii
 Face recognition, win prizes
 bhaag lene ke lieclic karenpadhen: autowalon ke bahaane raaj kaa uttar bharatiyon par nishanabiti raat mumbai main autowalon ko kahin peeta gaya, kahin unke auto ko jalaayaa diya gaya to kahin auto main jamkar todphod machaai gai
 The only mistake is that they are all targeted by Raj Thackeray
 bandra main emenes ke kaaryakartaaon ne ek auto main aag laga di or autochaalak ko bhi jalaane kii dhamkee di
 Not only this, MNS activists also pasted threatening posters for the autowall on the roadside
 padhein: aakhir kyon raaj thakare ne boli hindimumbai ke is autowale kaa kasoor sirf itnaa he ki isane kuch savaariyon ko le jane se manaa kar diya
 The workers of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena gave such a small punishment to this small thing
 uske auto ke shishe chakanachur karke
 The incident is from Vile Parle area of mumbai and Raj Thackeray's party workers publicly hooligans with the autowale
 padhein: raaj thakare ne kaha, ‘lakhon shivasainik hai meri sampatti’ham bataate hai emenes ke kaaryakartaaon kii is khuleam gundgardee kii vajah
 Actually, the target of party president Raj Thackeray is now the autowale of Mumbai
 khaskar wo jo uttar pradesh or bihar ke hai
 On October 3, 6 thousand auto drivers went on strike and last month too, auto drivers went on an unannounced strike
 dekhen: emenes ke kaaryakartaaon kii saream gundgardeeotowalon kii hadtaal ke liye raaj thakare auto union netaa sharad raav ko jimmedaar maanate hai or anjaam bhugatne kii saaf-saaf dhamkee de rahe hai
 Maharashtra Navnirman Sena president Raj Thackeray says that if the same drama of Sharad Rao continues, it will make it difficult for him to get out of the house
 dekhen: gujarat daure par raaj thakare ne kya kahakareeb 3 saal pehle raaj thakare ne nishaanaa banaaya tha uttar bhartiya taxi waalon ko
 The BMC elections in Mumbai are near at the moment and Raj Thackeray may have come in full form again in an attempt to spark his politics by targeting his policies and auto drivers

 modi sarkaar ke notebandi ke faisle ko lekar vipaksh kaa hangaamaa jari he
 However, due to the opposition not being fully united on this issue, it is difficult for them to be pressurized by the central government
 bihar main mahagathbandhan kii sahyogi congress ko jadyu pramukh nitish kumaar kii ore se notebandi kaa samarthan raas nahin aa rahaa he
 The Congress, which has been loudly surrounding the Modi government over demonetisation, has raised the issue of the Prime Ministerial candidate for the 2019 elections
 congress ne kaha ki mahagathbandhan kii ore se pradhanmantri pad kaa keval ek hi ummidavaar hoga or vah nitish kumaar nahin balki congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi honge
 The Congress believes that by supporting the central government's decision on demonetisation, Nitish Kumar is looking to build his independent image keeping the 2019 general election in mind
 notebandi ke khilaaf somvaar ko jab deshbhar main pradarshan hue to congress, trinmul congress or left front ne isamen jor-shor se hissaa liya lekin jadyu adhyaksh or bihar ke siem nitish kumaar ne saaf kar diya ki wo notebandi ke khilaaf pradarshan kaa hissaa nahin honge
 However, earlier, Sharad Yadav, former JDU leader and party president before Nitish, stood against demonetisation in opposition from opposition in Parliament
 congress kii ranneeti rahul gandhi ko notebandi ke khilaaf modi sarkaar ke virodh-pradarshan kaa mukhar cheharaa banaakar aagaamee aam chunaavon main pradhanmantri pad ke liye unki ummidavaari majboot karnaa he
 In such a situation, the Congress has suffered a major setback due to Nitish Kumar's support of demonetisation
 congress kaa maananaa he ki nitish kumaar ne loksabhaa chunaav ko dekhte hue notebandi par apana yah rukh apanaaya he
 Nitish is trying to become the leader of the regional forces or the Third Front with this political move or is seeking to stand with the BJP in the post-election alliance
 lekin congress kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki loksabhaa chunaav main bihar ke votaron ke liye ek gathbandhan main do netaa -rahul gandhi or nitish kumaar- nahin ho sakate
 It is being said that Lalu Prasad has also made a complaint to Nitish by calling Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 sutron kaa maananaa he ki nitish or lalu ke bich sabakuch thikthak nahin chal rahaa he, aise main gavarnence ke masale par nitish lalu se duuri bananaa chaahate hai
 Nitish Kumar supported demonetisation from the beginning and said that it will help in curbing black money and corruption
 nitish kumaar ke is rukh se siyaasi galiyare main aisi baaten hone lageen ki bihar chunaav se pehle bijepi se naata todane vaale nitish piem modi ke kareeb aa rahe hai
 Some NDA leaders like Ram Vilas Paswan started putting up Nitish Kumar
 paswan ne nitish ko endie main shaamil hone kii peshkash karte hue kaha ki unke or lalu prasad ke bich sabakuch thik nahin he
 It was also claimed that the coalition government in Bihar would not last long
 haalanki, nitish kumaar ne somvaar ko party vidhayakon kii meeting main aarope lagaaya ki notebandi par bayaan ke baad unka siyaasi kariyar khatm karne kii sajeesh kii ja rahi he
 Rabri Devi, the former CM of Bihar, made a statement by pouring ghee in the fire, amidst the bitter relations between Lalu and Nitish over the ruckus caused by Rabri's statement
 unhone kabhi nitish sarkaar main dipti siem rahe bijepi netaa susheel modi ko lekar vivaadit tippanee kar daali
 However, when Rabri's statement was captured in the cameras of the TV channels, she realized her mistake
 unhone ise majaak kahkar bayaan par pardaa daalane kii koshish kii
 But it is difficult to say that everything is fine in the Grand Alliance which was in power in Bihar a year ago
 mangalvaar shaam nitish or lalu kii mulaakaat hui
 After this, a statement came from Lalu that he supports demonetisation, but the general public is worried about the problems being faced by it
 lalu ne yah bhi kaha ki bihar main mahagathbandhan ko lekar vipaksh yani bijepi kii ore se bhram failaayaa ja rahaa he
 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is currently on a visit to Uttar Pradesh
 wo yahaan kisaan yatra nikaal rahe hai or iske jariye siyasat kii bisaat par apni party kii punarsthapana kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 He started this state-wide journey from Deoria district of Purvanchal and will end on Delhi land
 kisaan kii baat kar rahe rahul ne jab devaria se apni yatra shuru kii to aashirwad lene ke liye rudrapur ke dudhnath baba ke mandir ja pahunche
 Rahul went to Gorakhpur from Deoria
 shuukravaar ko wo faijabad hote hue ayodhya aa pahunche or yahaan prasiddh hanumangadhi mandir main darshan-archan kiya or phir mahant gyaandas se ek band kamare main mulaakaat bhi kii
 Walking out of Hanumangarhi, Rahul had a tilak on his forehead and a sparkle in his eyes
 wo bina kuch bole hi vahaan se aage bad gaye
 Actually, he did not want to get caught up in another message by speaking something
 rahul kii ore se unke maththe par laga tilak hi sandesh tha
 This message is for a particular sect and also for a particular caste
 rahuldansal yahaan doharaa card khel rahe hai
 His visit is focused on the farmers but the eyes are on the vote of the forward
 khaskar brahman vot bank ko rijhaane main rahul or congress party koi korkasar nahin chhod rahe
 The Congress party has already declared former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit as its candidate for the upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh
 shila dikshit brahman hai or pradesh ke ek pratishthit brahman parivaar kii bahu hai
 While Rahul was traveling through these districts considered to be the threshold of the Pandits and proceeding to the temple, Sheila Dixit arrived at the mother Vindhyavasini temple in Mirzapur to seek blessings
 aisa achaanak hi nahin hua he ki congress ke netritv kaa ishtprem jaagrit ho gaya he
 These images have a message and that message is clearly meant for Brahmins
 jati kaa tilkarahul or congress ke is brahman prem ko samajhane ke liye soobe kii vartmaan raajnneetik paristhitiyon ko bhi samajhnaa padegaa
 The Bharatiya Janata Party, which created history in the state with 73 mps in the 2014 Lok Sabha, has a pathetic position in the Assembly
 unke paas 403 vidhansabha siton vaale soobe main keval 10 pratishat siten hai
 BJP wants to end this exile in next year's assembly elections
 iske liye bijepi kaa ganit jis jatigat akalan par aadhaarit he, usamen dalit or muslim vot na ke baraabar hai
 It is an exaggeration to say that the BJP is in the position of a big breach in the votes of the Yadavs too
 bijepi kaa aadhaar agadon kaa vot he
 It was the same in Bihar and the same in Uttar Pradesh
 baaki kii ummid anya pichhadon or ati pichhadon se hasil ho paane vaale voton par nirbhar karti he
 In such a situation, if a party feels that it has to stop the bjp's chariot, then it must first weaken its core vote bank i
e
 presence among the Forward
 congress isi akalan ke hisaab se apni chunavi ranneeti taiyaar kar rahi he
 The Brahmin has been a traditional voter of the Congress for a long time
 jaise-jaise congress kamjor padi, yah aadhaar khisakta rahaa
 But this time, by playing the trumpet of Sheila Dixit, the Congress has started wooing the Brahmins back
 congress agar brahmanon kaa vot kaat paane main safal rahi to isse bhaajapa ke majboot hone kii sambhaavnaaen jheen hongi or uttar pradesh se dobaaraa wo sandesh doharaaya ja sakegaa jo bihar main mahagathbandhan kaa hissaa banakar congress de pai thi
 The Congress and its campaign manager Prashant Kishor, who are fighting the battle of 2017, are really eyeing the 2019 election and the 2017 Uttar Pradesh election is quite decisive in that direction
 ise is tarah se bhi dekhen ki jis congress party ke netritvvali upie sarkaar kaa 10 varshon ke dauraan zyada dhyaan mazdooron, bhoomihinon par kendrit tha wo party aaj kisaanon kii baat zyada kar rahi he
 In fact, despite being less in number, the rights over the land are more with the Forwards
 uttar pradesh main brahman, thakur or yadavon ke paas khaasi jaminen hai
 The debt waiver, which the Congress is repeating in UP, will benefit the Forward, the Backward and the Dalits less
 rahul kisaanon ke saath khaat daalkar baithe hai
 But there is tilak on the forehead and its old support base
 bijepi ke liye yah nishchit rup se chintaa kaa vishay he
 In Mumbai, a foreign woman was attacked by a man with a blade and escaped by snatching her expensive mobile phone
 badi baat yah he ki yah ghatana local train ke mahila coach main hui

 mumbai kii ek local train ke mahila coach main ek agyaat vyakti ne ek america naagarik par hamalaa karke uskaa mobile phone chin liya
 Police said the incident occurred in the evening between Marine Lines and Charney Road stations of Western Railway when an unknown person came in a women's coach and tried to snatch the bag of US citizen Michelle Mark

 The other passengers took the victim to the Mumbai Central police station with the officers

 The woman has suffered minor injuries to her hands and face
 jiarapy adhikari ne kaha ki vah is maamle ko ucch adhikariyon ke paas lekar jaaenge
 a case has been registered against the unidentified man and the woman was discharged from hospital after treatment
 saamaanya varg ko 10 fisadi aarakshan dene ke maamle main philhal supreme court ne roak nahin lagaai he

 Earlier, while hearing the case, the Supreme Court had said that in the next hearing, it would be considered whether the 124th Constitution amendment should be stayed or not
 sarvocch adaalat ne kanoon par roak lagane yaa maamla badi bench ko bhejne kaa aadesh dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 The court had issued a notice to the central government seeking an answer
 darasal, yachika main supreme court main 124wein samvidhan sansodhan ko chunauti di gai he

 Significantly, this bill gives 10% reservation to upper castes in government jobs and educational institutions

 This was considered to be the master stroke of the Modi government as there was a protest against the Modi government in many parts of the country against this bill which came against the decision of the Supreme Court

 Premium charges apply !! ham sabhi ko berthde, meeting or doctor se apoinament jaise rojaanaa ke kaamkaaj ke liye reminder kii jarurat padati he, lekin ricki dean kii yaaddasht itani kamjor he ki unhen khaane se lekar brush tak karne kii baat yaad dilaani padati he
 And like Aamir Khan of 'ghajini', Rikki is always surrounded by various lists and boards to remember things
 unka yphone bhi unhen yah yaad dilaane main madad karata he ki unhen tay samay par apane doston se kab or kahaan milanaa he
 Let us tell you that in the film 'ghajini', Aamir had a problem of short term memory loss, but Rikki never remembers anything
 daily mail ke mutabik ricki ke liye sirf bhavishya main hone vaali baton ko hi yaad rakhana chunauti nahin he, balki unhen kal kii baaten bhi yaad nahin rahati hai
 When Rikki, 19, was born, she had difficulty breathing and later learned that she was a victim of autism
 doctoron kaa kahana he ki ve jis tarah kii takalif se guzar rahe hai uskaa koi naam nahin he
 According to Rikki, 'it gets very difficult at times, but the family and friends give me a lot of support
 mere dost majaak bhi karte hai or yah kaaphi acha he
 They tell me that i borrowed money from them a week ago
 mujhe kabhi yaad nahin rahata ki maine unase paise liye bhi the yaa nahin, isliye main ek list taiyaar kar letaa hum or agar ve mujhe bevakoof bana rahe hote hai to main unhen wo list dikhaa detaa hum
 'he says,' My situation can be quite frustrating for people
 khaskar tab jab unhen yah pataa chale ki mujhe samay se sambandhit koi bhi chijen yaad nahin rahati hai
 If i don't have lists that remind me of things like brushes and lunches, I'll be a bit lost
 'unke mutabik, 'sabase kharaab baat yah he ki mujhe doston se milane kaa samay bhi yaad nahin rahata he or main achche doston ko bhi bhul jaataa hum
 i cannot think of taking anything forward because there is no concept of time for me
 'jab ricki 11 saal ke the tab unke gharavaale unhen check-ap ke liye le gaye, jahaan pataa chalaa ki unhen puri tarah se memri los kii samasya he
 For three years, he did not go anywhere except his home because he never remembered where he was going, but now he relied on the iphone for this
 unki maa nikki kahati hai, 'hamane ricki ko aazaadee dene kii koshish bhi kii, lekin kooking jaise kaamon main kaaphi risk hota he
 He does not remember whether the oven is on for five hours or for five minutes
 lekin phir bhi usne bahut mehnat kii he or wo dusron ke liye preranarot he
 'you will be surprised to know that despite such a serious illness, Rikki is studying agriculture and horticulture
 unke 40 varshiya pita gairi kehete hai, 'jahaan tak ricki kii beemaari kaa sambandh he to vah lakhon main kisi ek ko hoti he
 He is struggling with both autism and weak memories
 pehle hamen laga ki use food allergy he, lekin baad main patala ki yah otism he

 mahatma gandhi kii hatya ke peeche videshi haath ho saktaa he
 This claim has been made in a petition filed in the Supreme Court
 yachika ke anusaar mahatma gandhi hatyakand main mukhya hatyare nathuram godse ke saath narayan dattatreya apte ko 15 november, 1949 ko faansee par latakaaya gaya tha
 The petition claimed that Apte's identity was under suspicion
 yahi vajah he ki yachika main mahatma gandhi hatyakand kii jaanch phir se karaane kaa anurodh kiya gaya he
 The identity of Apte is disputed
 Let us tell you that in order to find out the entire conspiracy of the Kamahatma Gandhi assassination, Justice JL Kapoor Commission in 1966 said that Apte had been in the Indian Air Force
 haalanki purv raksha mantri is yachika ko daalane vaale dow pankaj fadanis ko suchit kiya ki ‘‘narayan dattatreya apte ke vaayu sena kaa ek adhikari hone ke bare main kahin bhi koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 Former Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar gave this reply to Pankaj, a researcher and petitioner in the apex court on January 7, 2016
 aise main shodhakarta or abhinav bharat ke trustee fadanis ne mahatma gandhi hatyakand kii jaanch par sawaal uthaate huye kaha he ki yah itihaas main lipa-potee vaala ek sabase bada maamla he
 He has also attached the petition to Parrikar, the then Defense Minister and now the Chief Minister of Goa
 yachikakarta ne daleel di he ki is tarah kii soochna se 30 janvari, 1948 ko rashtrapita mahatma gandhi kii hatya main kathith videshi haath kii sanliptata sabit hoti he
 Information about the non-availability of Air Force Officer was written in the letter given in the letter with former Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar that i have investigated the matter
 mujhe suchit kiya gaya he ki yah maamla vaayu sena ke bheetar hi vibhinn agensiyon, raksha mantralay kii divijan or britain ke echsiai sthit ee ke paas bheja gaya tha
 However, no record has been found regarding any information related to Narayan Dattatreya Apte
 raksha mantralay ke itihaas prakoshth ne to rashtriya abhilekhaagaar, kendriya sachivalay pustkaalay se bhi sampark kiya or mahatma gandhi hatyakand ke mukademe ke nijee kagajaat kaa bhi adhyayan kiya gaya he
 The letter also states that the Gazette of India (air Cell) was also searched for 1943-46, but no information was found about him being an officer of the Indian Air Force
 phir se ho jaanchandnis ne parrikar ke patr ke aadhaar par gandhi hatyakand maamle kii phir se jaanch karaane kaa anurodh karte huye supreme court main tark diya he ki aisi sthiti main is tathy par bharosa karne kaa paryaapt aadhaar he ki apte british force 136 kaa oparative tha
 This can be confirmed only after further investigation in this matter
 aapako bataa den ki supreme court ne is maamle main purv atirikt solicytor general or senior vakil amarendra sharan ko nyaay mitra niyukt kiya he
 They will study Phadnis' plea and documents provided by him about the murder
 is yachika main gandhi hatyakand main ‘teen bullate kii kahani’ par prashn chihn lagane ke saath yah sawaal bhi uthaaya gaya he ki kya nathuram godse ke alaava kisi anya vyakti ne chauthi bullate bhi daagi thi? is hatyakand main adaalat ne 10 farvari, 1949 ko godse or apte ko maut kii sajaa sunai thi
 Vinayak Damodar Savarkar was given the benefit of doubt due to lack of evidence
 purvi punjab hai court dwaara 21 june, 1949 ko godse or apte kii maut kii sajaa kii pushti ke baad donon ko 15 november, 1949 ko ambala jail main faansee de di gayi thi

 rajdhani dilli kii sadaken in dinon 'chalo ramlila maidan' ke poster se pati hui hai
 Each poster has a picture of Rahul Gandhi and Ajay Maken and below is a picture of a person asking for tickets as a requestor
 tikat ke liye aae 12 hajaar aavedandellimein nigam chunaav kaa bigul foonkane ke liye congress party ne 7 march ko ramlila maidan par raily kaa aayojan kiya he
 More than 12 thousand applications have come to the party so far for 272 seats
 aise main ek anaar ko kai biimaar main baantne ke liye kadaa imtihaan he or isaki kasuti he ki koun kitne bason main kitni bheed ramlila maidan kii taraf laa saktaa he taaki party alaakaman ke saamne khud ko sabit kiya ja sake
 40-year-old Balakishan, who is running a poster campaign, is seeking tickets from Kamla Nagar and is also taking a padyatra as well as a poster campaign to make Rahul Gandhi's rally a success
 baalakishan kehete hai ki ve kareeb 10 bas lekar jaaenge or party unki mehnat ko dekate hue party jarur unki baat sunegi
 In order to make Rahul's rally a success, Balakishan has put up big posters in the entire area and appealed to the people going door to door with folded hands
 utsahit hai congress kaaryakartausman congress party kii chandani chowk ke jiladhyaksh he or saath hi sadar bazaar seat setikat ke aavedankartabhi hai
 Usman says that the motive behind taking the bus to Rahul's rally is not to ask for tickets, but rather the enthusiasm among the workers themselves and they want to reach there in large numbers
 is babat osman roj meeting karte hai or tay karte hai ki koun block adhyaksh kitni bheed laane main sakasham he
 The scale of Rahul's rally will be obvious
 The Congress party must claim that it will distribute tickets in the corporation elections according to the selection process, but there is also a certainty of making the success of Rahul Gandhi Kirali at Ramlila Maidan

 The case of increase in fees of private schools in Delhi has been catching up
 alag-alag skulon main fees badhotaree ke maamle saamne aane ke baad sarkaar par karrwai kaa dabaav bad rahaa he, to kai jagahon se fees badhotaree ke baad gussaye abhibhavakon ke virodh pradarshan kii khabaren bhi saamne aayi hai, iske baad vipaksh ne fees badhotaree ke maamle par kejariwal sarkaar ko gherna shuru kar diya he
 Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari has alleged that on the one hand the government talks about curbing private schools, claims to end profiteering of private schools, but also allows them to increase fees through the previous route
 
 dilli sarkaar nijee skulon ke maamle main doharaa ravaiya apana rahi he or fees badhotaree kaa taaja maamla sarkaar ke isi doharepane kaa nateeja he
 Manoj Tiwari, citing the fee increase notices received by the parents of the school children, said that the parents of each child have received notices of recovery of additional fees ranging from Rs 10 to 40 thousand, not only that the school has increased this They are pressuring parents to recover the fees incurred
 bijepi kaa aarope he ki skulon kii ye muhim sarkaar kii us manjuuri kaa nateeja he, jisamen sarkaar ne skulon ko saatven vetanman ayog kii siforeeshon ke mutabik fees badhaane kii chhot di he
 The opposition is alleging that the government has also given exemption to the schools from the back door to collect arrears from the parents of the children for the increased fees from the previous date, which is why notices are being given by the schools
 tiwari ne kaha ki ek taraf tomanish sisodiyanijee skulon kii manamaani rokane kaa daawa karke apni peeth thapthapate hai, lekin ab pichhali tarikhon se fees vasuuli ja rahi he, to sarkaar aisa ravaiya kyon apana rahi he or logon ko gumraah kiya ja rahaa he, kyonki bina sarkaar kii sahmati ke fees badhaane kaa faisla nijee skool nahin le sakate

 Chief Minister Sheila Dixit of Delhi has become very famous for creating ruckus with her statements, in this order, CM Sahiba has come into the headlines by saying that increasing rape cases and other criminal cases in Delhi are increasing due to outsiders
 aisa pehali baar nahin hua jab shila dikshit ne dilli main aae bahari logon par aise iljaam lagaae hon
 Sheila Dixit herself is not originally from Delhi, so her statement is very irresponsible
 isse pehle bhi shila deekshit dilli main baahar se aae logon ko shahar kii sari pareshaaniyon ke liye jimmedaar tehra chuki hai
 In January this year, when Sheila Dixit was asked what is the reason behind the rising crime against women in Delhi, she said that the difficulties have increased due to people from outside
 itnaa hi nahin CM sahiba ye bhi bol chuki hai ki baahar se aae log dilli kaa 'risource' kaa kha rahe hai

 Senior leader Bhuvanchandra Khanduri was sworn in as chief minister again after a total of 808 days in exile between the political stalwarts and Uthapatak in the small hill state of Uttarakhand
 bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh nitin gadakari ne shanivaar ko mukhyamantri ramesh pokharial nishank ke istife kii ghoshnaa karte hue khanduri ko phir se satta kii bagdor saunpane kaa faisla kiya tha
 According to Vikram Samvat, Sunday is the day of eternal fourteen, which proved to be auspicious for Khanduri but is full of despair for Nishank
 ekaek raajnneetik ghatnakram main ati aatmavishvaas se bhare mukhyamantri nishank ko 806 dinon ke baad satta ganvaani padi he
 Nishank tried to explain his position to the party high command till the last time, but the party leadership, who had already decided, did not listen to him and gave his order for Nishank to resign
 khanduri ko 25 june 2009 ko us samay pad se istipha dena padaa tha jab loksabhaa kii paanchon siton par party kii karaari haar kaa thikra unke sir par phodte hue tatkaaleen party netritv ne unhen pad se hatane kaa nirdesh diya tha
 Khanduri had then stepped down, taking moral responsibility for the party's defeat and recommended the post of Chief Minister to his closest confidant Nishank
 nishank ke istipha diye jane par apni pratikriya vyakt karte hue purv mukhyamantri bhagatsingh koshiyaari ne kaha ki jab khanduri ko hataaya gaya tha to vah kadam bhi party kaa rajya hit main tha or aaj jab unako waapas laayaa gaya to yah kadam bhi rajya hit main he

 BJP state president Bishan Singh Chufal said that the party high command has decided to change leadership in view of the 2012 assembly elections
 varsh 2012 mishan kii kamyaabi ke liye party samuhik netritv main chunaav ladakar satta main vaapasi karegi
 On the other hand, the state president of the main opposition Congress, Yashpal Arya, said that the BJP has confirmed the allegations of corruption made by the Congress by changing the Chief Minister on the state government
 haalanki unhone yah bhi kaha ki pehle khanduri ko kyon hataaya gaya or ab phir dobaaraa kyon laayaa gaya, yah samaj se pare he
 There has been no specific reaction in the BJP to remove Nishank, but some leaders have expressed their displeasure

 After the formation of Uttarakhand, BJP first appointed Nityananda Swamy as Chief Minister but he remained in this post for only 11 months
 iske baad satta kii kaman bhagat singh koshiyaari ko saunpi gayi
 Koshiyari was the chief minister for five months but the Congress was in power after the election defeat
 varsh 2007 main jab party dobaaraa satta main ai to khanduri ko mukhyamantri banaaya gaya
 After him, Nishank and now Khanduri have been given power
 is tarah bhaajapa ke chah varsh ke shasankaal main khanduri paanchave mukhyamantri hai
 Regarding the change in leadership, Kishore Singh Bisht, a teacher working in Dehradun, said that Khanduri's clean image would benefit the party in the upcoming elections but due to short time, this term would prove to be very heavy for Khanduri
 unhone kaha ki party adhyaksh swayan maan chuke hai ki nishank par koi aarope nahi tha
 In such a situation, the decision to remove them in a hurry will raise many questions
 saamaajik kaaryakarta pankaj chouhan ne kaha ki nishank ko hataakar party ne vipaksh ko ek nayaa mudda de diya he
 Although the party will get the benefit of Khanduri's experience, but for Khanduri himself, this term will be very risky
 party netritv ne unhen aise samay main jimmedaari saunpi he jab puure desh main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf logon main chetana jaagrit hui he
 Khanduri's wife Aruna Khanduri expressed happiness over the party leadership's decision that it was a victory for truth and honesty
 haal hi main bhaajapa ko chhodkar uttarakhand raksha manch kaa gathan karne vaale purv saansad tii pi es ravat ne kaha he ki nishank ko hataaya janaa manch kii pehali jeet he

 Tekram Kandela, the coordinator of Haryana's Sarva Khap Panchayat has warned that despite the Supreme Court's directions to maintain the status quo, if the Punjab government bans the canal, we will block Punjab's way to Delhi
 sarvakhap panchayat ne baithak kar liya faislajind jile ke kandela gaanv main huikhap panchayaton kii baithkke baad tekram ne kaha ki ham koi gaiyr kanoonee kadam nahin uthaanaa chaahate, lekin punjab sarkaar ne apana ravaiya nahin badla to hamen sadak par utarana hoga
 He has termed the efforts of the Punjab government against the people of Haryana
 roak denge dilli se punjab kaa samparkunhone kaha kipunjab sarkarasbase badi adaalat kii lagaataar andekhi kar rahi he
 In such a situation, we will cut off the connectivity of the national capital Delhi to Punjab
 unhen haryana hokar dilli pahunchane nahin diya jayega
 We will stop their paths

 laal kile ke pracheer se pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa yah paanchvaan or vartmaan modi sarkaar kaa yah antim sambodhan tha
 The country has seen his tenure of more than four years and before that he had addressed the people of India four times as Prime Minister from the ramparts of Red Fort
 pehle varsh yani 2014 main jab apni pehali gaiyr congress bahumat vaali sarkaar ke saath pradhanmantri is kile par desh ko azaadi ke din sambodhit karne ke liye khadey hue the to usamen ek drushti thi
 This was the vision of his concept of India and the implementation of the promises he made to the people during his election campaign
 is bhaashan main unhone ek alag tarah se desh ko aage le jane ke or aakraamak tareeke se badlaav laane ke sanket die the
 In later speeches, he was seen attacking the opposition, counting his work and speaking on issues affecting the people directly
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke abtak ke kaarykaal main aisa shaayad hi kabhi hua ho jab wo chunaav abhiyaan kii mudra main na nazar aae hon
 There was a reason behind this
 desh main ek ke baad ek rajyon ke chunaav saamne aate rahe or unke bhaashanon kii style or vishay vastu usko dhyaan main rakhkar logon ke saamne aati rahi
 But the fifth address from Red Fort meant a lot to Prime Minister Modi
 pradhanmantri kaa is varsh kaa sambodhan apni uplabdhiyon ko ginane se lekar nae kaam or kaaryakramon kaa lekhajokha dene jaisaa tha
 Beginning the speech from the bill passed on reservation, Modi maintained his entire address in 2013 versus 2018
 ise padhein
 
 
 2013 vs 2018: Modi said - same land, same sky, double the pace of work, he counted his mantra of work, took some resolutions for the future and also expressed discomfort and impatience to set many new records while in power
 is tarah wo logon ko ye sanket dete nazar aae ki agar vikaas ke is silsile ko aage lekar janaa he to aagaamee chunaav main unki vaapasi hi ekmaatr vikalp he
 The Prime Minister is hopeful that the north-east states will gain in the forthcoming elections, so the rejuvenation of the north-east got special importance in the barns
 saath hi mahila suraksha par madhya pradesh or rajasthan kaa naam lene se wo nahin chuke
 Assembly elections are due in the next few months in both the states
 rakshaatmak modimodi apane bhaashan main sadaa se aakraamak rahe hai
 But this speech of Modi appeared more defensive than in 2014
 wo vivaadon se bachate rahe
 Stay away from words that would reveal them or their shortcomings
 gohatya se lekar ganga kii safai tak, pakistan se lekar enarasi tak, dalit utpeedan se lekar mob linching tak or naukariyon ke avasar se lekar kisaanon kii aatmahatya tak modi desh ko kuch bhi sandesh dene se bache
 Although avoiding the mention of minorities, Modi was seen reiterating his commitment to triple talaq
 kisaanon ke samarthan mulya or doguni aay kii unhone charchaa kii
 Mentioned surgical strikes and increased employment opportunities
 antarrashtriya manch par bharat kii badhati pratishtha kii baat bhi unhone jor dekar kahi

 PDP se alag hone ke baad modi ko yaad aayaa vaajapeyi kaa 'vijan kashmir'bhale hi china or pakistan se lekar puure dakshin asia main bharat kii kamazor hoti sthiti par wo khamosh hi rahe
 Moreover, the PDP in Jammu and Kashmir who repeatedly reminded the BJP that the present government should again focus on the vision of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, that vision also came to the Prime Minister when the party in the state Broke alliance with PDP
 mahangaai ko lekar modi jis tarah ke bhaashan pehle dete rahe, kaledhan par sarkaar kitni safal rahi or rupee kii girti saakh par unke jo vichaar pehle the, unpar ab wo kya sochate hai, yah bhi modi ke bhaashan main kahin bhi jaahir nahin hua

 39 baar 'garib', jaane PM modi kii spich main koun shabd kitni baar ayakhali hota shabdkoshpradhanmantri ke lagbhag sabhi bhaashanon ko sunen to usamen ek tarah kii punrariti dekhne ko milegi
 Construction of toilets ranging from neem coated urea, freedom from nepotism and curbing corruption, transparency in functioning and respect of soldiers, Startup India, Standup India, Make in India, Ease of Doing Business
 
 
 aise kai naare or visheshan modi apane bhaashanon main doharaate rahe hai
 In this sense, this fifth address of the Prime Minister remained as a safe iteration address
 pradhanmantri kii body language pehle se kuch kamazor dikhi
 He was seen to be weak in retaining his magic by repeating the words
 aisa laga ki jaise nae sapane dikhaane kii jo kala unke paas he, uske liye unke shabdkosh main aage ke panne khaali ho gaye hai, shabd rikt ho chuke hai
 Modi said 82 minutes
 lekin isbaar na aakarshan dikhaa or na hi utsaah
 Because the standards of attraction and enthusiasm that he himself has set, his speech today seemed to be lagging behind on the same parameters
 dekhnaa yah he ki aaj ke sadhe, rakshaatmak or dohraye jate shabdon vaale ek chunaav anukool bhaashan ke baad jab modi chunaav ke maidan main honge to vahaan kitni urja or kitne josh ke saath wo nae jaadu ko kaayam karne kii koshish karenge

 It said that there is no such example that in the history of 130 years of this old party, any person has remained in the post of Congress President for 17 years

 abhinetri-filmkaar nandita das dwaara nirdeshit or navazuddin siddiki kii mukhya bhoomika se saji 'manto' kaa trailor swatantraaa diwas kii purv sandhya par relies kiya gaya
 'manto' co-produced by HP Studios, Filmstock and Viacom 18 Motion Pictures revolves around author Saadat Hasan Manto
 navazuddin is kirdaar ko jivit karte dikhaai denge
 After all, why did Manto go 'crazy'? Nawaz's dialogues playing Manto's role in the trailer are very effective and tell the truth of his time
 manto ek jagah kehete hai ki jab ham gulam the, to aazaadee kaa khwab dekhte the, ab aaazaad ho gaye to koun sa khwab dekhen
 Munto says in one place, some women are not selling themselves, but people are selling them

 tivi actor kritika kamra or karan kundra kaa brallep hone ke baad bhi phans donon ko saath dekhne kii guzarish kar rahe hai
 But with Kritika's shocking recent statement, it seems that this dream of fans can never be fulfilled
 darasal ira dube ke chat sho main karan wahi sang pahunchi kritika kamra ne ek sawaal ke jawaab main eks boyfriend karan kundra ke bare main kaha he ki vah use jaan se maar dena chaahati hai
 Ranbir Kapoor does not know the boundary, Karan told- Checked without asking during my phonechat show when Kritika was asked with whom she wanted to marry, with whom she wanted to have an affair and whom to kill? The option gave three names - Karan Johar, Karan Kundra and Karan Wahi
 kritika ne saaf kaha ki vah karan kundra ko maarna chaahati hai, karan wahi sang afaire karnaa chaahati hai or karan johar ke saath shaadi rachaana chaahati hai taaki unke bacchon ruhi or yash kii dekharekh kar saken
 This is probably the first time that an actress has spoken about marrying Karan Johar
 ab karan johar kaa is par kya riection rahata he, ye jaananaa mjedaar hoga
 Notice to Karan Johar, may be 5 years in jail! Talk about Kritika's statement that she killed Karan Kundra, there was no such tension after their breakup
 yahaan tak ki kritika ne ek bayaan main kaha bhi tha ki unhen karan kundra kii garlfriend anushaa dandekar behad pasand he, vah anoushka ke saath hangout karti hai

 The new disease will not save Baba but only and only implicate

 Asaram's High Court has not only rejected the bail, but the Jodhpur court has sent Asaram's disciple Shilpi to a 3-day police remand
 aakhir main sarkari vakil ne court main ek medical report pesh kii jiske anusaar asaram ko peedophelia naam kii beemaari se grast bataaya gaya he

 Although in the world of psychology or medical science, this disease is called pedophilia, but the fact is that the patients of this pedophilia are seen in the eyes of Hikrat almost all over the world
 kyonki peedophilia ke mariz aksar un masuumon ko apni yon hinsa yaa kuntha kaa shikaar banaate hai, jinhen duniya or duniyaadaari kii samaj tak nahin hoti
 It has been revealed about Asaram by the Additional Solicitor General of Rajasthan Anand Purohit himself
 yah baat rajasthan hai court main kahi gai he, jahaan asaram ne apni zamaanat ke liye arzi lagaai thi
 But before the court could decide on the issue of granting bail to Asaram or not, Anand Purohit changed the course of the case by describing Asaram as a victim of pedophilia
 purohit ne bataaya ki police kii ab tak kii tafteesh main ye baat saafe hui he ki asaram satsang or pravachan ke dauraan apni chhavi kii aad main ladakiyon or khaas kar bacchon ke saath galat harakatein karte rahe hai, jo peedophilia beemaari ko sabit karti he
 Purohit told how Asaram not only conspired to make this girl a victim of his ulterior motives, but also committed illegal acts with many other girls of the ashram with the help of his quartet
 vaise peedophilia ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki iskaa ab tak duniya main koi ilaaj nahin he

 Water was doing injustice to the Dalit even in those days, and the responsibility of water in the house of Dalit was also on the head of a woman! But struggle and rebellion is also being done by Gangibai, a woman, even at the cost of putting herself in danger

 When this anecdote is being written, it must have been the same thing from village to village, how is it surprising? But still see what is happening in the society that is wearing this so-called development? a ground fellow told us that there is still a well in his area which is at the bottom, but has four parts from the top! It has many clutches
 har jati ke liye alag—alag bantwaaraa he
 One part of the tribals, one of the Harijans, one of the Yadavas, one of the big castes
 neeche pani to ek he, upar sabakaa hissaa alag—alag he! yah baat sunakar chaunkna swaabhaavik tha
 Also because there has been a lot of water in the country on Dalit discourse, it has been more than seventy years for independence, and it has also been a long time to surrender the spirit of equality in the Constitution

 One or two more people came

 This is why all people have been drinking water for years

 There is also a pipe line in the village itself, there will be water supply through this pipeline from the main road, but the sarpanch husband told us that his water will be supplied to make the highway, we will not get it or not
 alabatta unhone kaha ki isi kuen kaa gaharikaran ho jaae, to garmi main hone vaali samasya se chhutkaaraa mili
 He also tried to know from some questions that why we are interested in the well? People want to get rid of their problem, but no one wants to talk about the problem of their society
 aakhir ek samaaj main ek gaanv main itnaa maheen bantwaaraa ab tak sweekaarya kyon or koi bhi us par kuch karata kyon nahi ? is gaanv kii koi gangi thik baaju kii duusari ghirri par apni rassi chadhaane kii jurrat raat ke andhere main bhi kyon nahin karti, jabaki kuen ke saamne na to thakur kaa ghar he or na hi thakur kaa vaise rob
 Years and years passed for the establishment of democracy in the country and in the Panchayati Raj, revolutionary decisions like reservation of 50% of women were made
 kya isi gaanv kii mahila sarpanch jo khud us duusare samaaj ke hisse hai, ne kabhi aisi bujurgon ke banaae is system ko todane kii koshish kii hogi
 Will the government also wake up? Even if you wake up, you don't understand, which department will be responsible for this? The Panchayat and Rural Development Department will come, or the Tribal Department will come, the Drinking Water and Sanitation Department will be seen or the better health will be referred to or finally it will be said that it is a matter related to education, should the Education Department see each other Will we avoid saying that or will we find a way to overcome these problems in the village together?

 However, Sharad Pawar did not turn out like this

 Sharad Pawar has paid the debt of Bal Thackeray by making Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray the chief minister of Maharashtra
 darasal saal 2006 main bhi raajnneetik halaat kuch aise hi the
 At that time, Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule contested the Rajya Sabha elections for the first time from the NCP
 tab balasaheb thakare ne supriya sule khilaaf koi ummidavaar khadaanheen kiya tha
 Thackeray said that it is a matter of pride that the daughter of Maharashtra is going to Delhi
 vah hamaare saamne hi badi hui he, aise main ham uske saamne pratyaashee nahin utaarenge
 In this way Supriya Sule was elected to the Rajya Sabha
 bal thakare ne is tarah se raajnneeti kii us swasth parampara kaa nirvahan kiya tha jo ki aaj ke daur main bahut kam dikhaai detii he
 Sharad Pawar has presented a similar case after 13 years due to political issues
 sharad pavaar ne aaj uddhav thakare ko siem banaakar us ehsaan kaa badla chukaa diya he
 After the election results of Maharashtra, the political situation became such that Shiv Sena could not align with BJP
 iskaa nateeja hua ki shivasena or bijepi alag ho gayi
 Uddhav formed a new alliance Mahavikas Aghadi with the congress-ncp
 isi bich ajit pavaar kii baghawat ne siyaasi sankat paidaa kar diya, jiske baad sharad pavaar ne morcha sambhala or is tarah se uddhav thakare kii siyaasi raah kii sari mushkilon ko aasaan kar diya
 Now Sharad Pawar himself gave Uddhav Thackeray the CM post for a full five years, even when his number of mlas is just two less than Shiv Sena
 is tarah se 13 saal baad bane raajnneetik halaat main sharad pavaar ne us karj ko jabardast andaaj main chukaaya he, jise bal thakare ne 2006 main supia sule ko rajyasabha bhejne ke liye kiya tha

 Akhilesh Singh Yadav, who is distancing himself from his father and blaming what is wrong with the Samajwadi Party, is gaining popularity in UP
 ise dekhakar bijepi or basapa sashankit ho gai hai
 The BJP is now under increasing pressure to bring a face to the Chief Minister for the UP elections
 sapa ke ghamaasan ne duusare dalon kaa chunavi ganit bhi gadabada diya he
 Political parties like BJP and BSP are eyeing the entire situation with a breathless stare
 khaskar shanivaar ko chachaa-bhatija ke bich jo takaraav hua, usase akhilesh yadav kii party main sthiti or majboot hui he or unke saath badi sankhya main vidhayakon ke dikhne se saaf ho gaya he ki sapa kaa asal netaa koun he
 After this, the BJP may also have to change its strategy
 akhilesh yadi apni party ke puure bhuuchaal ko niyantran main kar lete hai or virodh ko puri tarah se dabaa dete hai, to bijepi ko koi siem cheharaa saamne laane ko majaboor hona pad saktaa he
 However, some BJP leaders say that what is happening in the socialist party is according to the fixed 'script' and the public is understanding this
 bijepi netaaon kaa kahana he ki vah abhi dekhne or intjaar karne kii hi niti apanaayenge, kyonki akhilesh ko majboot or acchhee chhavi kaa pesh karne kaa jo 'drama' chal rahaa he , usase unki lokapriyata aage chalakar kam ho sakati he
 The problem in front of the BJP is that there is no consensus in the party about any one face and at this time there is a possibility of many politicians rebelling by presenting any face
 kuch bijepi netaaon kaa kahana he kibigepub asthirataa or kunbe kii ladaai ko apana mantra banaakar logon ke bich jaaegi or sthirataa or vikaas jaise naaron ke saath vot maangegi
 He says that the sp's fight is a sign of a good day for the BJP in the state

 Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee office in Lucknow witnessed marathon meetings of Priyanka Gandhi and Western UP in-charge Jyotiraditya Scindia for the first time with the newly appointed National secretary-general taking charge of Eastern UP in-charge
 road sho ke jariye 11 farvari ko congress ke rashtriya adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke saath lakhanu pahunchane vaale in donon netaaon ne congress karyaalay main deraa daal diya tha
 The four-day tour was to end on 14 February with a press conference but the event was postponed due to the terrorist incident in Pulwama
 haalanki us din shaam ko saat baje vahaan pulavama main shahid javaanon ko shradhanjali dene ke liye do minute kaa maun rakhaa gaya
 During this time, the special thing was that BJP MLA Avtar Singh Bhadana from Meerapur of Muzaffarnagar and former Union Minister of State for Home Ramlal Rahi were also present there
 in donon kii maujuudagi ne siyaasi halkon main halchal paidaa kar di
 Suresh Rahi, son of Ramlal Rahi, one of the influential Dalit leaders of Congress in UP, is a BJP MLA from Hargaon assembly constituency in Sitapur
 darasal, jyotiraditya sindhiya ne 13 farvari ko raamalaal raahi or congress ke purv gurjar netaa avatar singh bhadaana se lambii baatcheet karke in netaaon kii congress main ghar vaapasi kii raah tay kar di thi
 In such a situation, the pair of Gurjar leaders like Avatar Singh Bhadana with Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot can provide fertilizer and water to the political land of Congress in the areas of Haryana and Rajasthan including western UP

 Shiva Pandey, who is associated with the Congress's organization minister (organization) and the state president, says, "camping in Lucknow with big leaders like Priyanka Gandhi and Jyotiraditya Scindia has instilled confidence in the old leaders and cadre of the Congress
 duusari partiyon main ja chuke kai netaa ab apni puraani party main vaapasi kaa man bana rahe hai
 "the Congress has engaged all its Lok Sabha in-charge to contact the old leaders who have gone to other parties and are looking for the possibility of their return
 sthaneey congress netaaon ke saath loksabhavar baithken karke priyanka gandhi or jyotiraditya ne upi main sust padi party kii 'beemaari' pakadaaey kii koshish kii he
 Before coming to the booth at focusup, Priyanka had realized that the battle for the next Lok Sabha election would be fought at the booth level
 priyanka kii sabase badi chunauti isi nichle paaydaan par congress ke ladaaku taiyaar karne kii he
 In Lucknow, on the afternoon of 12 February, Priyanka Gandhi started meeting the groups of populist leaders in the Congress office
 pradesh adhyaksh ke kaksh main priyanka or jyotiraditya netaaon se intervyuu lene ke andaaj main mil rahe the
 Priyanka first met Unnao Lok Sabha constituency leader with former MP Anu Tandon
 priyanka ne poochna shuru kiyah ''aapke kshetra main vidhansabhavar kitne booth hai?", ''aapke grih booth kaa number kya he?", ''booth par congress sanghathan kii sthiti kya he?", ''prayek booth main kitne voter hai?" aise prashnon ke jariye priyanka ne har loksabhaa kshetra ke netaaon ke man main yah baat bithaane kii koshish kii ki bagaiyr booth jite loksabhaa chunaav nahin jeeta ja saktaa
 The same weakness was also shown to the Congress in the 2017 assembly elections when the party, fighting for 114 seats in alliance with SP, could not even find polling agents at 30 per cent of the booths
 ab loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle dedh lakh se adhik boothon par sanghathan khadaa karne kii behad kathin chunauti se paar paane ke liye priyanka ne amethi or raibareli model kaa sahaara liya he
 "A platform has been developed by connecting booth workers in Rae Bareli and Amethi with the whatsapp group," says Deepak Singh, a member of the Congress Legislative Council
 us par chaoupal ke jariye party kii nitiyon ko booth str tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 "priyanka and Jyotiraditya have instructed the district presidents to implement the party's instructions on the ground through regular chaupal by forming a whatsapp group of booth workers
 puraane sanghathan par hi bharosamohanlalganj loksabhaa kshetra ke netaaon se milane ke dauraan priyanka ko ek netaa ne khud kaa parichay pradesh mahaamantri ke rup main diya
 Priyanka chocked and said, "whoever is coming to meet, is calling himself the state general minister
 aisa kyon?" jawaab mila, ''500 logon kii pradesh kaaryakarini he jo pichley chah varshon se gathit nahin hui he
 "the factionalism spread in this Jumbo Working Committee was revealed to Priyanka on February 18 while meeting the leaders of Bundelkhand in the Congress office in New Delhi
 unke saamne hi do netaaon main aarope-pratyarope shuru ho gaye
 Priyanka not only advised the leaders to work together, but also directed the state president to reduce its size in the next formation of the State Congress Working Committee
 congress ke ek pradesh mahaamantri bataate hai, ''loksabhaa chunaav se pehle upi congress kii kaarysmiti main badlaav karnaa sambhav nahin he
 To speed up election preparations, for the first time, the party has appointed local leaders in charge of the Lok Sabha constituencies

 The party has focused its attention on the 33 seats that the party has won one or more times since 1991
 inamen se keval saat siten hi aisi hai jinhen pichley 28 varsh main congress ne do yaa isse adhik baar jeeta he
 The Congress, which has unsuccessfully used to divide its organization into zones before the 2014 general elections, is once again preparing to appoint one acting president for Eastern and Western UP
 pashchimi upi main muslim or dalit maton main sambhaavna dekh rahi congress isi varg se kisi chehre ko kaaryvahak adhyaksh ke rup main aage karne ke ganit par manthan kar rahi he
 In Eastern UP, a Brahmin card can also be played to lash out at the Brahmins who are angry with the BJP
 choti partiyon ke liye khule daravajecongress ke liye upi main chunaav purv gathbandhan kabhi bhi sakaaratmak nattejey nahin dilaa sakaa he
 In the 1996 assembly elections, the Congress formed an alliance with the BSP and the party's vote percentage was 15 in the 1993 election
 08 se ghatakar 8
 35 percent
 isi tarah 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main sapa se gathbandhan karne par party kaa vot share kareeb aadha ghat gaya tha
 In the last general election, Congress contested in nine seats with Rashtriya Lok Dal and Mahan Dal on four seats, but the party could get less than eight percent votes (see graphics) which is the lowest figure of last four elections
 lakhanu vishvavidhyalay main associat professor rajeshwar kumaar bataate hai, ''pichley loksabhaa chunaav ke baad purvanchal ke kurmi netaa benny prasad verma samet sthaneey jatiyon par prabhaav rakhane vaale kai netaa congress chhodkar anya dalon main ja chuke hai
 To compensate for this, it is the compulsion of the Congress to take local small parties based on caste
 "sapa ke baagi netaa or pragatisheel samaajawaadee party (lohia) ke adhyaksh shivpal singh yadav se samjhaute ke liye rahul gandhi ke kareebi kendriya netaaon kii kai daur kii baatcheet ho chuki he
 Negotiations were to be held between Rajya Sabha mps Sanjay Singh and Shivpal Yadav on February 14 to finalize the seat coordination, but this was postponed after the Pulwama attack
 congress madhya or purvi upi kii kareeb 10 siton par shivpal yadav se talmail karne kii icchhuk he
 The Congress leaders have also approached the leaders of the Apna Dal (krishna Patel) after being aligned with a great party having influence in the backward castes like Maurya, Shakya, Saini
 pashchimi upi main jatav birdari main asar jamaa rahe bhim army ke adhyaksh chandrashekhar bhale hi basapa kii mukhiya mayawati ke prati narmi dikhaa rahe hon par pradesh congress upaadhyaksh or pashchimi upi main party kaa muslim cheharaa bane imran masood se unki kareebi jagajaahir he
 "during Priyanka Gandhi and Jyotiraditya Scindia's state visit, the nature of alliance with regional parties will be decided," says a former Congress MP
 "dilli kaa siyaasi rasta upi se hokar jaataa he
 This is the reason why Rahul Gandhi has fielded Priyanka Gandhi in the election battle to win UP

 a post shared by Neetu n Chandra (@neetunchandra) on May 20, 2018 at 10:15pm PDT This morning i called the house, i kept saying hello from here but there was no sound from there
 phir ghar se phone aayaa to bhi haalat jas kii tas rahi
 i was able to talk to the house in my third attempt
 doston se baat kii tab pataa chalaa ki ye unke saath bhi hota he
 Incidentally, it was being talked about when i came to the office and heard the telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad talking on the same issue on TV, then it came to know that the matter was of call-drop
 aakhir kyon ho rahaa he kol drops ?telephone companiyon kaa kahana he ki unke paas puure spectrum nahin he
 The minister is saying that there is enough spectrum
 khayr spectrum kii baat na bhi kare to desh main mobile tower lagane vaali kapaniyon ke sheersh sanghathan typa (TAIPA) ke pramukh umang das kaa kahana he ki desh main sava 6 lakh toweron kii jarurat he par abhi maatr sava 4 lakh tower hi maujuud hai
 Even if we calculate 5 lakhs per tower, immediate investment up to Rs 10,000 crore is required which is nothing compared to the profits of the telecom companies
 kol drops se aapako kitna nuksaan ho rahaa hai?tri ke quarterli reportpadhi tab kuch-kuch ganit samaj main aane laga ki kis tarah telecom companiyaan ham sabhi ko thag rahi hai
 India has more than 97 crore telephone subscribers, of which 94 million are mobile users
 ham-aap isi gananaa kaa hissaa he
 The report says that we talk on average over 10 minutes a day
 or agar man liya jaae puure din main aapkaa 1 kol drops hi hota he or prati kol 10 paise (jo ki nunatam hai) hi dene padate hai
 Nevertheless, telephone companies are making profits of more than three thousand crores annually only through call drop
 ye ham sabhi ko apni jeb se chukaana pad rahaa he
 Complaints of call drops from Bangladesh and Pakistan are not only in India but also in our neighboring countries
 par vanha naa to log hamaari tarah shant baithe or na unki doorsanchaar viniamak sanstha hi or shaayad isi kaaranbangladesh or pakistanki telecom companiyaan har kol drops par ek free kol detii hai
 In such a situation, the question is why there is no such provision for call drop in India? basapa pramukhmayawatine bada bayaan dete hue kaha ki ve madhya pradesh or rajasthan main kisi bhi keemat parcongresse gathbandhan nahin karengi
 His decision did not come suddenly like this
 darasal congress netadigvijay sinhakaa ek bayaan aaj aayaa, jisase mayawati buree tarah khafa ho gayi
 In fact, senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh had said in an interview to a news channel that Mayawati is under pressure from CBI and ED, due to which she is not coming with Congress
 unhone kaha ki vah mayawati kaa sammaan karte hai or unki majaburi bhi samajhate hai
 He also said that Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia are responsible for the alliance in Madhya Pradesh
 digvijay singh kii ye baat mayawati ko chubh gai
 He not only disassociated himself from the alliance by holding a press conference this evening, but even called Digvijay Singh an agent of BJP
 mayawati ne digvijay singh par sidhaa hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki ve bijepi ke agent hai
 Digvijay says that Mayawati is under pressure from the Center due to which she is not doing an alliance
 unka ye bayaan puri tarah aadharahin he
 Apart from Digvijay, he also pointed to some other leaders
 mayawati ne kaha ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or sonia gandhibspise gathbandhan karne main puri tarah eemaandaaree dikhaa rahe, lekin kuch congress netaa ise nahin hone dena chaahate
 He said that leaders like Digvijay do not want an alliance in the congress-bsp
 mayawati ne digvijay ke baad congress par hamalaa kiya
 He said that the Congress understands that it will single-handedly defeat the BJP, but the ground reality is something else
 log congress ko unki galatiyon or bhrashtachar kii sajaa denge
 The impact of Mayawati's decision will not only be seen in the forthcoming assembly elections, but will also be on the equations of the general elections to be held in 2019
 congress samet kai dal milakar 2019 main modi kaa muqabla karne ke liemhagathbandhanabanane kaa dambh bhar rahe hai, lekin mayawati kaa ye faisla is par baari pad saktaa he
 The Congress, while controlling the damage, said on Mayawati's decision that she has given this statement in anger
 ise tool nahin dena chahie
 Congress spokesperson Rundeep Singh Surjewala said that we do not think that the adverse remarks made about the Congress leader are correct, but the remarks made in angry feelings should not be so overrated
 unhone kaha ki agar mayawati ji ko rahul gandhi or sonia gandhi par yakeen he to baaki samasyaon ko nipta liya jayega
 Police also arrested another woman along with Honeypreet
 haniprit isi mahila ke saath punjab ke bhathinda main chuphi hui thi
 The woman was in constant contact with Honeypreet since her disappearance
 philhal, police us mahila se bhi poochtacha kar rahi he
 Gurneet Ram Rahim's face-down daughter, Hanipreetco, was arrested by the police from Zirakpur Patiala Road in Punjab
 usee dauraan haryana police ne ek anya mahila ko bhi giraftaar kiya tha
 During the interrogation, he was identified as Bhatinda, a resident of Sukhdeep Kaur
 sukhdeep or uskaa puraa parivaar dere kaa purana anuyaayi he
 Sukhdeep's entire family often spent their time in Sirsa camp
 haniprit faraar hone ke baad sukhdeep cor ke sampark main ai thi
 Honeypreet was at Sukhdeep's house in Bathinda for 2 days before her arrest
 iske baad jis samay police ne haniprit ko giraftaar kiya, us samay bhisukhdipuske saath maujuud thi
 Explain that the police had reached Nepal to find Honeypreet who was absconding for 38 days
 lekin vah kai logon kii madad se jagah-jagah chhipati rahi
 Honeypreet was last seen outside Rohtak jail at the time of Ram Rahim's arrest
 jiske baad vah ram rahim ke paitruk gaanv gursar modia pahunch gai thi
 However, she absconded a few days later
 iske baad police ko kai jagah uske dekhe jane kii khabar mili
 Police raided several states in search of him

 a few days later, the police arrested him from Punjab
 maharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav ke baad bane shivasena, congress or rashtravaadi congress party ke gathbandhan ke jariye gathbandhan kii raajnneeti par nae sawaal khadey hue hai
 Political parties, which had long abandoned purity and political honesty, continue to spoil arbitrary alliances for profit, as is evident from the Shiv Sena case
 sawaal isliye uthaa he kyonki isse janata thagi jaati he
 The bjp-shiv Sena's electoral alliance got the mandate to form the government but Shiv Sena stepped out of it and formed the government with new allies
 gathbandhan main jane or nikalne kii prakriya ko darasal samhitabaddh nahin kiya gaya he yani is vishay par kanoon nahin banaae gaye hai
 Perhaps that is why the petitioner, who took the issue of Maharashtra's new coalition to the Supreme Court, could not achieve anything
 hindu mahasabha ke pramod pandit joshi kii taraf se daakhil yachika ko supreme court ke nyaayadhish en
 V
 ramanna, justise ashok bhushan or sanjeev khanna kii peeth ne khaarij kar diya
 The court said that we do not want to get into this matter
 justise ramanna ne kaha ki raajnneetik naitikta, sanvaidhanik naitikta se ekadam alag he
 In democracy, we cannot deprive political parties of the right to form coalitions
 raajnneetik partiyon kii ranneeti do tarah kii hoti hai, ek chunaav pehle kii or duusari nateezon ke baad kii
 Before the election, the entire emphasis is on attracting voters and the political power gained from the results is used to recover the investment made in the election
 iske liye gathbandhan ko tilanjali kanoonee taur par galat nahin he
 In the period before the defection law was enacted, mlas or mps used to go to the party with unabated advantage
 1985 main rajeev gandhi kii sarkaar iske samaadhaan ke taur par dalbadal kanoon lekar ai
 The defection law does not apply to alliances, so the court cannot do anything on it
 sitambar 2015 main bhi supreme court ke samaksh aisi hi yachika ai thi jisamen chunaav baad raajnneetik gathbandhan ko janata ke saath dhokhaa bataate hue adaalat se ise asanvaidhanik qaraar dene kii maang kii gai thi
 This petition was also dismissed and the court refused to interfere in the case
 tab yachika kii sunwaayee karne vaali peeth main shaamil pradhan nyaayadhish justise ech
 L
 dattu ne yachikakarta se poocha tha ki agar adaalat is maamle main dakhal de bhi do gathbandhan karne vaale dal ye kah denge ki ab ham mitra ban gaye hai isliye talmail kar rahe hai
 Or political parties can also say that we have formed an alliance to save the cost of re-election
 isi peeth ke justise amitabh raay ne yachikakarta se poocha tha ki koun sa kanoon he jo raajnneetik partiyon ko chunaav ke dauraan kiye vaayade puure karne ke liye baadhya karata he
 Codifying the politics of coalitions is a very difficult task
 isamen saansadon kii abhivyakti kii swatantraaa bhi aade aati he
 Ideology is not binding for unlimited time
 vichaardhaara main badlaav mumkin he
 If the Shiv Sena was a staunch Hindu supporter till yesterday, then its leaders and that party have the right to change their ideology
 ye baat anya sabhi dalon par lagu hoti he
 Therefore, it is very difficult to continue pre-election alliances and check post-election alliances
 bahut jokhim lene vaali yaa bahut taqatvar or bhavishya ko lekar aashwast sarkaar hi gathbandhanon par kanoon bana sakati he
 But the voter has open avenues to keep the parties of selfish alliances enjoying the elections according to his own

 Actor Vivek Oberoi has seen both success and failure in his decade-long film career, but he says that doing social work for him and making others happy is more than an award or reward
 37varshiya vivek ne ek saakshaatkaar main bataaya, filmon main abhinay karnaa meraa junun he, lekin dusron ke aansu ponchney or chehron par muskaan laakar meri jindagi main jo ek tarah kaa aatmasantosh or sarthakata aati he naa, vah bahut khaas he
 
 vah sukh mujhe aaj tak mili kisi bhi puraskaar or inaam kahin adhik santosh detaa he

 tivi frij kaa exange ofer to aapane suna or dekha bhi hoga
 But now criminals are also being arrested under the exchange offer
 ye axange ofer aajkal aparaadhiyon par gaaj kii tarah gir rahe hai
 The criminals who once committed a crime in the safe zone are now running away, but where do they run
 nepal ab sef jone nahin rahaa
 No one can know this more than Yasin Bhatkal, an Indian Mujahideen terrorist
 indian mujahiddeen kaa oparational head yasin bhatkal pichley do varshon se aaraam se nepal ke pokhara main rah rahaa tha
 His partner Bone was also with him
 bharat main kai dhamaake kar suraksha or khufia agenciyon kii neend haraam karne vaala yasin bhatkal aaraam se pichley do saalon se nepal main chupa hua tha lekin achaanak ek din nepal police ke sahyog se bihar police ne use dhar dabocha
 This was the biggest offer of criminals' exchange
 bharat-nepal police main behatar talmelayasin bhatkal ko giraftaar karnaa koi aasaan kaam nahin tha
 Several hundred kilometers away from the border, he was staying in his security circle
 sabase pehle use ek masjid main navaj padhate hue mubir ne dekha jisaki nishandehi par ek bade oparation ko anjaam diya gaya
 This was possible with the help of Nepal Police
 donon deshon ke bich pratyrpan sandhi nahin he jiskaa phayda apradhi abtak uthaate rahe hai
 But now one to one criminals are being arrested due to better coordination between police officers of both the countries, including terrorists like Yasin Bhatkal
 yasin bhatkal kii giraftaar main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane vaale motihaari ke espi vinay kumaar bhi maanate hai ki nepal police kaa puraa sahyog isamen rahaa
 India is believed to have given 5 criminals to Nepal that in lieu of the arrest of Yasin Bhatkal, Bihar Police has handed over at least five famous criminals to Nepal, who were searching for Nepal Police for many years
 halaki ye alag baat he ki pratyrpan sandhi na hone kii vajah se aisi giraftaareyon kii jagah ko takneekee taur par border bataaya jaataa he
 Not only criminals but smugglers or hawala workers are also being caught due to better coordination between the authorities of the two countries
 is behatar talmail kaa taaja shikaar he faujee singh jo varshon se nepal main rah kar bihar ke kai jilon ke liye aatank bana hua tha
 It was arrested on Friday
 ye bhi aparaadhiyon ke axange ofer kaa nateeja he
 Sunil Jaiswal was also handed over to the Nepal Police a few days ago, the police arrested Sunil Jaiswal, a suspected criminal from Nepal and handed him over to the Nepal Police
 sunil jaisawal par nepal main hatya kaa aarope tha
 He killed four Maoist leaders
 to duusari bihar ke kai jilon kaa aatank bablu dube ko nepal police ne kathmandu main giraftaar kiya, lekin pratyrpan sandhi nahin hone kii vajah se takneekee taur par use bihar police ko nahin saunpa ja saktaa tha
 In such a situation, Nepal Police released him at the border where Motihari police again arrested him
 bablu doobe par bihar ke kai jilon main sau se zyada rangadari kaa maamla or darjanon hatya kaa aarope darj he
 There are technical problems due to the absence of an extradition treaty between the two countries, but it is possible due to better coordination
 pichley kareeb 9 se 10 maheenon main saikadon aparaadhiyon ko donon deshon kii police ne pakadaa he
 These criminals were not only dangerous but they are also being caught who used to flee to Nepal after committing minor crimes
 motihaari ke espi kaa kahana he abtak keval purvi champaran ke 80 pratishat bhaage huye apradhi nepal se giraftaar kiye ja chuke hai
 Nepal is no longer a safe zone for criminals
 jo apradhi pehle bharat main aparaadh karne ke baad bekhauf hokar nepal main rahete the aaj bhaage bhaage phir rahen he unka thikaana lagaataar badal rahaa he
 Police of both India and Nepal are following them, there is no place when they will be caught
 pehle aisi sthiti nahin thi
 The Indian police did not have any coordination with the Nepal Police and due to lack of extradition treaty, the criminals would take shelter in each other's country unknowingly after committing the crime, which had a direct effect on the people there
 border ke ilaako main khauf main jeena aam logon kii majaburi thi lekin nae halaat se aam janata bhi khush he
 However, this better coordination at the local level is not only catching criminals but also creating a new trust among the people of the two countries which was on the verge of breaking up in the last few years
