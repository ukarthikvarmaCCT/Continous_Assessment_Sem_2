 bijepi kii jeet ne musalamaanon ko hinduon kii bhaawanaaon kii izzat karnaa sikhaaya he or yah sabit ho gaya ki musalamaanon ke saath ke bina bhi chunaav jeeta ja saktaa he
 In an interview given to the English newspaper Hindustan Times, Singhal called Narendra Modi an ideal volunteer and said that Modi will work on the issue of Hindutva apart from the previous NDA government
 singhl ne kaha, 'desh ke musalamaanon ko ayodhya, kaashi or mathura par apana daawa chhod dena chahie or uniform civil code sweekaar kar lenaa chahie
 If that happens, we will love them and not claim any other mosque, whereas thousands of mosques have been built by demolishing temples
 'singhl ne kaha ki agar musalmaan ise sweekaar nahin karte hai to unhen hinduon kii ekajutata kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 Singhal, 88, said that Modi's victory in the Lok Sabha election with a majority has given a deep blow to Muslim politicians and foreign forces who want to destroy the country's identity

 Elections are to be held in Uttarakhand early next year
 sutron ke mutabik, ravat ne pradesh ke netaaon ke saath milakar uttarakhand congress kaa plan taiyaar kar liya he
 According to sources, this is the plan of Uttarakhand Congress prepared by keeping Harish Rawat at the center

 party ke baagi vijay bahuguna, harak singh ravat ko hi bhrashtachar ke liye jimmedaar batakarajanata ke bichpesh kiya jaae or bataaya jaae ki congress or harish ravat paak-saaf hai
 Also, the stigma of corruption is on Vijay and Harak
 4
 Harish Rawat himself undertakes a padyatra across the state and tells the public how BJP and rebels tried to topple his government
 5
 Instead of state BJP leaders, Harish Rawat should directly target Narendra Modi and Amit Shah
 6
 In the remaining tenure, only clean faces got a place in the cabinet
 7
 Workshop of senior leaders and spokespersons of the state should be organized
 unako sahanubhuti kaa phayda uthaane vaali baton par hi focus karnaa bataaya jaae, saath hi sabhy bhashaa main sidhe piem modi ko ravat sarkaar ko asthir karne kaa jimmedaar tehraaya jaae
 8
 harish ravat ko rajya ke sabase bade kad vaale netaa ke taur par project kiya jaae
 It is to be told that Harish Rawat is the biggest leader in the state, whether Congress or BJP
 9
 Instead of adopting an aggressive approach in campaigning, let the public sympathize with the story of the injustice done to Rawat and his government
 10
 Particular care should be taken to deal with the hindu-muslim polarization strategy of the BJP, especially in the plains, ie the Congress may appear on the path of soft Hindutva, but the message of Muslim appeasement should not go anywhere

 5 Stardirector: Neeraj Pandeyakalakar: Akshay Kumar, Taapsee Pannu, Rana Daggubatti, Danny Denzongpa, Anupam Kher and KK Menon There is no doubt that Neeraj Pandey is a good director
 ve acchhee kahaniyaan chunate hai
 They take good work from actors and keep the story and editing very well
 in sari baton ke darshan'baby'main bhi ho jate hai
 The story is tight
 desh bhakthi kii bhaavana se ot-prot he
 But Neeraj Pandey does not lose focus in the film, and so does the whole film
 jahaan har kirdaar apane kaam main bahut zyada vyast he
 The story moves at a fast pace
 lekin film main 'di de 'or 'holiday' jaisi filmon kii jhalak milti he
 How much of the story is the five-year 'babi' mission of a few selected officers, its only purpose is to destroy the enemies of the country
 iske adhikari apni pahchaan chhipaakar kaam karte hai or desh ke liye qurbaan ho jate hai
 a similar officer is Akshay Kumar
 use aatankwaadi (ke ke menon) ko thikaane lagaana he taaki desh ko surakshit kiya ja sake
 Characters like Tatsapi Pannu, Rana Daggubatti and Anupam Kher keep coming in the story
 haalanki film main pyaar or kamedi jaise factoron ke liye zyada samay nahin he
 The scenes are very long
 kahani main bahut zyada nayaapan nahin he lekin chaunkaane vaale kai pal hai
 The film's direction and Neeraj's treatment are the film's USP
 star apilaniraj pandeya kii filmon main koshish kahani ko upar rakhane kii hoti he
 'baby' is a similar film
 akshay kumaar kaa chayan ekadam sahi he
 If they run and act, then it seems that this guy can do it
 vaise bhi ve niraj ke saath'special 26'jaisi hit film de chuke hai
 The film stars Danny Goody
 vaise diarector ne kisi or kirdaar ko zyada ubharne kaa mauka nahin diya he, uskaa puraa focus akshay kumaar par hi rahaa he
 Taapsee wants to see Pannu a bit more, she does action, enjoys
 anupam kher bhi oke hai
 Rana is rarely seen speaking
 kamai kii batyah film niraj ke chaahane waalon ke liye acha tohfa hai
 Then this film is also special for Akshay Kumar's fans because their stars will be seen in a different style, very serious ones
 film main unki chhap kahin najar nahin aati he
 The entire style is of Neeraj
 film ko lekar verde of mouth kaaphi kaam karegaa
 It is getting a four-day weekend
 phir kahani main teji, kamaal kii editing or deshbhakti kii bhaavana is hafte ke anukool bhi he
 This week 'dolly Ki Doli' is released and the film is completely different, so 'baby' is not going to face much trouble in getting viewers
 film kaaphi bade bajet kii he, isliye weekend iske liye kaaphi ahm rahegaa

 According to former ITBP DIG GVS Chaudhary, morale from officer to soldier is being affected due to lack of promotion
 jaankaar bataate hai ki isaki shuruyaat saal 2010 main tab hui jab sarkaar ne mukhya kader main ipies kader kaa vilay karne kii yojana banaai thi
 Due to this, the promotion was interrupted
 is maamle ko court main chunauti bhi di gai he, lekin ab tak sarkaar ne is par koi nirnay nahin liya
 Due to this, 40 posts of Commandant, 40 posts of second-in-command, 300 posts of Deputy Commandant, 250 posts of Assistant Commandant, in addition to the same number of posts of Inspector, sub-inspector, ASI and Principal Constable are lying vacant in ITBP
 choudhary kehete hai, 'grih mantralay or itibipi ke adhikari agar teen saal pehle hi is babat gambhirtha se prayaas karte to aise halaat khadey nahin hote
 ITBP personnel and officers are appointed in sensitive places, if they get promotion at the right time, then they will be able to reach the higher ranks and their morale will also be elevated

 lihaaja koi kaarywahi nahin ho saki
 But amidst the uproar, the government passed three bills
 koyala block aavanton ke mudde par ab tak pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke istife kii maang kar rahi bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) maang ab aavanton radd karne or jaanch karaane par aa tiki he vahiin sarkaar ek kadam peeche hatane ko bhi taiyaar nahin he
 The government rejected both these demands on Monday
 bhaajapa sadasyon ke hangaame ke kaaran sansad main 9wein din somvaar ko bhi koi kaamkaaj nahin ho paaya or donon sadanon kii kaarywahi dinabhar ke liye sthagit kar di gai
 Demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) on coal block allocation
 lekin ab thodi narmi dikhaate hue bhaajapa ne kaha he ki yadi sabhi koyala block aavanton radd kar die jaaen or sieji kii report par nishpaksh jaanch ke aadesh de die jaaen to vah sansad kii kaarywahi chalane degi
 However, there are no signs of any deadlock being resolved
 bhaajapa kii ore se rakhi gai sharton ko centre sarkaar ne khaarij kar diya
 The government appealed to all parties to agree to a debate on the issue
 usne haalanki sweekaar kiya ki koyala block aavantit karne ke uddeshy ko jhatka laga he
 Union Finance Minister P
 chidambaram ne kaha, "pradhanmantri ke istife kii maang karnaa bekaar he
 
 ve jaanate hai ki yah kabhi nahin hoga
 As far as the cancellation of coal block allocation is concerned, action will be taken only after the report of the Inter Ministerial Group by mid-september
 " Chidambaram said, "the policy of allocation of coal blocks has been in force since 1993 but its purpose has suffered a setback
 kai khadaan hai jinamein khanan nahin hua he
 " koyala block aavanton kii nyaayik jaanch kii jarurat ko khaarij karte hue unhone kaha ki sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) sarkaar ne 2004 main nilaamee kii niti ko badalane kii sochi thi
 He said that the issue of coal allocation should be debated in Parliament
 "aamane-saamne jab bahes hogi tabhi isse kai baaten nikalakar saamne aaengi
 i appeal to the BJP to debate this in Parliament
 " According to Chidambaram, 47 allocated coal blocks have met the policies, 58 blocks, which have been issued notices, have not met the policies
 unhone block kaa vivaran dete hue kaha ki 30 blokon main koyale kaa utpaadan armbh ho chukaa he, jabaki 70 main aane vaale dinon main koyala utpaadan shuru ho jayega or 58 ko paryaavarniya manjuuri kii jarurat he
 Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal said that more than 75 percent of the mps were in favor of allowing the Parliament to function smoothly, but the BJP was bent on disrupting Parliament proceedings on the issue of coal block allocation
 bansal ne yah bhi kaha ki jin koyala block main utpaadan shuru nahin ho paaya he, kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) dwaara unki jaanch kii ja rahi he
 Bansal said, "75 per cent of the mps are in favor of allowing the house to function, but the BJP is adamant
 " Bansal said, "we have to follow due process of law
 hamane (koyala blokon ke aavanton ke samay) bhaajapa ke mukhyamantriyon se sahmati lee thi
 " bansal ne kaha ki is maamle main uchit karrwai karne kii prakriya shuru he or sibiai jaruri maamalon kii jaanch kar rahi he
 He said, "bjp's demand is to mislead the public
 " Union Law Minister Salman Khurshid rejected the demand for cancellation of coal block allocation, saying the opposition was not giving any fair alternative to the Congress-led UPA government to remove the deadlock over the issue
 khurshid ne kaha ki vipaksh kii maang khud se faansee lagane vaale kisi vyakti ko sammanjanak antim sanskaar kii peshkash karne jaisi he
 Khurshid said, "what he is saying is something like 'if you get hanged, i will do your respectful funeral'
" " Khurshid said, "they are saying that i will cut off your right hand, but leave the right leg
 ham koi chaalaaki bharaa vikalp nahin chaahate, ham uchit vikalp chaahate hai
 " khurshid ne kaha, "unhen pataa he ki koyala block aavanton radd kiye jane se niveshak kii bhaawanaaon or arthvyavastha par kya asar hoga? sansad baadhit hone se na keval desh kaa dhan nuksaan ho rahaa he, balki ham un vidheyakon ko nahin paarit kar paa rahe hen, jinke doorgaami parinaam hai
 " khurshid ne bhaajapa par yah aarope bhi lagaaya ki vah bhrashtachar nivarak vidheyakon ko bhi nahin paarit hone dena chaahati
 He said, "the key anti-corruption bills we are trying to pass are blocking everyone
 isse yah spasht hota he ki ve is baat ko lekar baichaiyn hai ki kahin paardarshita na aa jaae
 " khurshid ne yah kehete hue aavanton kaa bachaav kiya ki yah rashtrahit main he
 He said, "there is no problem in allocation of coal blocks
 aisa rashtrahit main kiya gaya tha
 " kanoon mantri ne kaha, "rashtrahit ko aage badhaane ke kai tareeke hai
 
 communiston ke apane tareeke hai, poonjivadiyon ke apane tareeke hai
 
 unka aacharan sankeern soch kaa pradarshan he, jo loktantr kii manyataon ke vipareet he
 " khurshid ne kaha, "ham apane loktantr par unki vaicharik hinsa kii anumati nahin de sakate
 It is completely against the ideas on which democracy rests
 " Meanwhile, continuing the attack on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley said, "the government has not responded to the scam in coal allocation
" pradhanmantri ne apni chuppi kaa hawala diya he
 The accused in the court has the right to remain silent but a Prime Minister cannot do so
 " Jaitley said, "he is in the post that is most accountable
 javabdehi or chuppi ek saath nahin chal sakate
 "jaitley also said that the BJP has not given up the demand for the Prime Minister's resignation
 gyaat ho ki pradhanmantri ne pichley dinon kaha tha ki hajaaron javaabon se behatar unki khamoshi he
 The Prime Minister had said, "my silence is better than thousands of answers, i don't know how many questions were kept
 "tippaniyan Senior CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yechury told reporters, "we have been demanding cancellation of coal blocks and their investigation
 sarkaar ko ab is disha main kadam uthaanaa chahie kyonki bhaajapa bhi uske is vichaar ke anuroop maang kar rahi he
 " sansad kaa monsoon satr saat sitambar ko samaapt ho rahaa he

 bhaajapa koyala block aavanton par niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak (sieji) kii report ko lekar pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke istife kii maang kar rahi he
 Due to uproar by BJP members, no work could be done in Parliament on Monday on the 9th day and the proceedings of both the houses were adjourned for the day
 koyala block aavanton par niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak (sieji) kii report ko lekar pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke istife kii maang kar rahi he
 But now showing some leniency, BJP has said that if all coal block allocations are canceled and a fair inquiry is ordered on the CAG report, then it will allow Parliament to function
 baharhaal, gatirodh dur hone ke koi sanket bhi nahin mil rahe hai
 The terms put by the BJP were rejected by the central government
 sarkaar ne sabhi dalon se is mudde par bahes ke liye sahamat hone kii apil kii
 It, however, admitted that the purpose of allocating coal blocks has come as a shock
 kendriya vitt mantri pi
 Chidambaram said, "it is useless to demand the resignation of the Prime Minister
 
 They know that it will never happen
 jahaan tak koyala block aavanton radd karne kii baat he to antar mantralayan samooh kii madhya sitambar tak report aane ke baad hi karrwai hogi
 " chidambaram ne kaha, "koyala block aavanton karne kii niti 1993 se lagu he lekin iske uddeshy ko jhatka laga he
 There are many mines which have not been mined
 " Rejecting the need for a judicial inquiry into the allocation of coal blocks, he said that the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government had planned to change the auction policy in 2004
 unhone kaha ki koyala aavanton ke mudde par sansad main bahes honi chahie
 "only when there will be a face-to-face debate, many things will come out of it
 main bhaajapa se apil karata hum ki sansad main is par bahes kare
 " chidambaram ke anusaar 47 aavantit koyala block nitiyon par khare utre hai, 58 block, jinhen notice jari kiya gaya he, nitiyon par khare nahin utre hai
 Giving details of the blocks, he said that coal production has started in 30 blocks, while in 70, coal production will start in the coming days and 58 need environmental clearance
 kendriya sansadeey kaary mantri pawan kumaar bansal ne kaha ki 75 pratishat se adhik saansad sansad kii kaarywahi sucharu rup se chalane dene ke paksh main hai, lekin bhaajapa koyala block aavanton ke mudde par sansad kii kaarywahi baadhit karne par amada he
 Bansal also said that the coal blocks in which production has not started, they are being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
 bansal ne kaha, "75 pratishat saansad sadan kii kaarywahi chalane dene ke paksh main hai, lekin bhaajapa jid par adi he
 " bansal ne kaha, "hamen kanoon kii uchit prakriya kaa paalan karnaa he
 We (at the time of allocation of coal blocks) took consent from the Chief Ministers of the BJP
 " Bansal said that the process of taking appropriate action in this case is on and CBI is investigating the necessary cases
 unhone kaha, "bhaajapa kii maang janata ko gumraah karne ke liye he

 Khurshid said that the opposition's demand is like offering an honorable funeral to someone who hangs himself
 khurshid ne kaha, "vah jo kah rahe hai vah kuch aisa he ki 'agar aap faansee laga len, to main aapkaa sammanjanak antim sanskaar karuunga'
 " khurshid ne kaha, "ve kah rahe hai ki main aapkaa dahinaa haath kaat luungaa, lekin dahinaa pair chhod duungaa
 We do not want a clever choice, we want a proper alternative
 " Khurshid said, "they know how cancellation of coal block allocation will affect the sentiments of the investor and the economy? The disruption of Parliament is not only hurting the wealth of the country, but we are not able to pass those bills
" We have far-reaching consequences
 " Khurshid also accused the BJP that it did not want the anti-corruption bills to be passed
 unhone kaha, "ham jin bhrashtachar nivarak pramukh vidheyakon ko paarit karne kii koshish kar rahe hai, ve sabhi ko avaruddh kar rahe hai
 This makes it clear that they are restless about whether there should be transparency
 " Khurshid defended the allocation saying that it was in the national interest
 unhone kaha, "koyala block aavanton main koi gadabadi nahin he
 This was done in the national interest
 " The Law Minister said, “there are many ways to advance the national interest
 
 Communists have their own ways, capitalists have their own ways
 
 His conduct is a display of narrow thinking, which is contrary to the beliefs of democracy
 " Khurshid said, "we cannot allow their ideological violence on our democracy

 While the Reserve Bank has fixed the weekly withdrawal limit at Rs 24,000, the banks themselves are further reducing this limit so that cash can be made available to as many people as possible

 bhartiya team kanpur ke green park stadium main apana 500waan test khel rahi he
 With this historic Test match, the domestic season has started where India has to play 13 Tests
 green park par bharat pichley 33 saalon se nahin haara he
 Also, the record of Team India on home pitches against New Zealand has also been excellent
 lihaaja majboot ballebaaji or turn leti pichon par phiraki ke fan ke ustaadon se saji team india is aitihaasik test ko jarur jeetegi basharte mausam saath de, aisa ham maanate hai
 Let us tell you five reasons why we believe that Team India will start the series with a win in the historic Test? The spinning fan on the turn-taking pitch is the best spinners in India's quiver
 newjiland ke saamne sabase badi samasya turn leti bhartiya pichon par aswin, jadeja or mishra sareekhe phiraki ke ustaadon ke saamne na keval apane wicket bachaae rakhane kii jaddojahad hogi balki yahaan unhen team india ke saamne ek bada total bhi khadaa karnaa hoga
 Not only this, when the Indian team comes out for bowling, then they will have to get out their batsmen as soon as possible so that they can be able to reach the position of drawing the match
 lekin yahaan kiwi team kamjor najar aati he
 Although he has the spin trio of leg-spinner Ish Sodhi, orthodox off-spinner Mark Craig and left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner, all three have experience of 98 Test wickets in total
 centner or craig pehali baar bharat ke khilaaf khel rahe hai to sodhi kotim indiyake khilaaf keval ek match kaa anubhav he
 In that he could not take any wickets in 21 overs
 haalanki sodhi ke paas 13 test main 35 wicket or centner ke paas saat test main 15 wicket lene kaa anubhav jarur hai
 The one bowler who will be keeping an eye on all three of them is Craig
 14 test maichon main 48 wicket lene vaale craig bhi pehali baar hi bharat ke khilaaf khel rahe hai lekin yahaan ek baat yaad rakhane kii he ki of spin ke khilaaf bhartiya ballebaaj jarur thode kamjor pad jate hai lihaaja craig ke khilaaf bhartiya ballebaajon ko hoshiyaar rahanaa hoga
 The Indian team is full of batsmen with Indian batsmen, where Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Rohit Sharma, Lokesh Rahul, Murali Vijay, Cheteshwar Pujara have top order batsmen
 saath hi aswin jaisaa olerounder bhi maujuud he
 Which 34 in Test matches
 26 ranon kii ausat se kheltaa he
 Has played four centuries and six half-century innings so far
 ek saal se test nahin haari team indiajaha bharat apana 500waan test khel rahaa he vahiin kiwi team kaa yah 413waan test he
 The Indian team has not lost a single Test match for the last one year
 is dauraan khele gaye 10 test maichon main se bharat ne 7 jite hai
 The team has reached the 500th match after winning from West Indies in this july-august
 to vahinujilandkee team november 2015 se khele gaye 11 test maichon main australia or dakshin africa se paanch match haari jabaki zimbabwe or srilanka ke khilaaf chaar match main jeet darj kii he
 In the last Test against Africa, the Kiwi team could score only 399 runs in both innings
 yani yaheen bhi bharat kaa palada hi baari dikhataa he

 Information was also given on coordinating with the Intelligence Wing of all the security forces
 netgrid kii baithak kaa ek ahm mudda ye bhi he ki aatanki jis tareeke se hitech hue hai, unke routine wireles band ho gaye hai, aise main aatanki nai frequency or kodeward kaa istemaal karte hai
 There was also discussion on decoding it through new technology
 sutron ne india today ko bataaya ki grih mantri na sirf netgrid ko punerjeevit karnaa chaahate hai balki saal ke ant tak yah kaam karnaa shuru bhi kar degi
 According to sources, in netgrid, two people have been given the responsibility to find out where the project got interrupted
 pehle saurabh gupta hai jinhen dhai maheene pehle hi netgrid main niyukt kiya gaya he
 The other is Ashish Gupta who is a joint secretary and an old government employee
 in par saal 2014 se netgrid ko jeevant karne kaa jimmaa he jab se ashok patnayak iske siio bane hai
 Delhi Assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel on Friday suspended Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA and Leader of the Opposition Vijender Gupta for the entire session for using 'unparliamentary language'

 After this, all the mlas of the opposition came in front of the Speaker of the Assembly and started protesting
 vidhansabha adhyaksh ne sabase pehle marshall ko bulaakar bijepi ke ek vidhayak majinder singh sirsa ko vidhansabha ke baahar nikalava diya
 Even then, the rest of the mlas continued to stand near the Speaker's podium and disrupt the proceedings

 The meeting was attended by Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju, Minister of State for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha, Minister of State for Home Kiran Rijiju, DG CISF, IB Chief, Home Secretary and Bureau of Civil Aviation officials
 drone hamale kaa khatraairport par drone ke khatre ko dekhte hue ye baithak bulaai gai thi
 Earlier, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval had talked to the Ministry of Home Affairs to strengthen the security of the airport based on the intelligence agencies report
 khufia agenciyon ko ashanka he ki aatanki sanghathan drone se airport ko nishaanaa bana sakate hai
 The risk of terrorist attack from the airport's front side is the highest
 airport kii suraksha ko lekar audit main airport se satee jhuggiyon, coloniyon or hotel ke jariye chintaa jataai gai thi
 There were reports that 26 out of 98 airport security is not strong
 agenciyon se mili input par charchicese pehle paanch agast ko dilli main grih rajyamantri kiran rijiju or naagarik uddyan rajyamantri jayant sinha ke bich hui ahm baithak main suraksha par charchaa kii gai thi
 In this, the input from the security agencies was discussed in detail
 ab sargical strike ke baad jis tareeke se aatanki khatre kaa dar bana he aise main ye baithak mahatvapurn he
 Several questions were raised in the security audit, let me tell you that in the airport security audit that was conducted on August 5, the government was warned that Delhi Airport has an aerocity
 yahaan kai oonchi building vaale paanch sitara hotel hai
 Terrorists can take advantage of their height
 slam or aasapaas basii coloniyaan khatarnaak sabit ho sakati hai
 Through them, we can easily target the airport
 cargo kii vyavastha par nigaraneeiske alaava siaisef or ibi ne apane suraksha par kiye adhyayan main kaha ki cargo kii vyavastha par nigaraanee kii bahut zyada jarurat he
 If there is a slight omission, then the terrorists can take advantage of the cargo and enter the airport
 guuruuvaar kii baithak ko lekar grih rajya mantri kiran rigiju ne kaha ki ye airport security audit ko lekar baithak thi
 The same Civil Aviation Minister Jayant Sinha said that the government keeps reviewing it from time to time on whoever is alert about safety
 pyaar, muhabbat, dhokhaa or phir sajaa
 This story of a person made up of these words, which you will find out by reading, how the police and administration are still helpless before the decree of Khap Panchayats
 ghatana rajasthan ke nagaur jile kii he
 The slum of Sheopatnath residing in Didwana town is right in front of the Additional District Superintendent of Police office on Nagaur Road
 shyopatnath ko beete dinon khap panchayat ke faisle par munh kaala kar gadhe par puraa gaanv ghumaya gaya
 He was given a garland of shoes, allegedly unnatural sex, and threatened that he would be killed if he complained to anyone
 lekin shyopat par hue julm ko police aparaadh nahin maanati or sajaa kii dhamkee dekar use thane se bhaga bhi detii he
 What is the matter? Actually, Sheopatnath's mistake is that he loved a girl and drove her away
 shyopatnath or uske parivaar waalon kaa kahana he ki ladki or uske parivaaravaalon se use jhuthe pyaar main fansaaya
 After being caught, the girl's brothers held the victim hostage and also sentenced to unnatural sex
 itnaa hi nahin shyopatnath ko pinjre main daal diya gaya or pani maangane par peshaab pilaayaa gaya
 According to the information, Sheopatnath, who lived daily with two elder brothers by daily wages, got engaged recently
 rasm ke anusaar doodh ke karj adaayagi ke rup main ladki ke parivaar waalon ko usne teen lakh rupee bhi die
 She was to be married in a village in Haryana, but when the wedding came, Sheopatnath's mother-in-law called her and pretended to fall in love with her daughter-in-law
 jhuthe pyaar main funskar shyopat ladki ko lekar haryana ke aadaa gaanv se deedwanaa aa gaya, jiske baad saas ne police main bahu ko bhagaakar le jane kaa maamla darj karvaa diya
 Sheopatnath, who was trapped in this false story of jutipyar-mohab to crack the police case, was subjected to unbearable torture by the Khap panchayat, while now he has been waiting for justice for four months with his elder brothers
 police ne bhi khap panchayat kii farmaan kii tarah apana faisla suna diya or maamle ko rafa-dfa karne main jute gai
 The victim is frightened by the heinous crime he committed and the threat of uploading his video on the Internet
 peedit ke mutabik, police use maamle se hatane kii dhamkee dekar daraa rahi he
 At the same time, the police say that no crime has been done with the young man

 You must have seen a lot of processions and baratis, but have you ever seen a procession of shameless people? When one such procession of shameless people came out in Ghaziabad near Delhi, the watchers just kept looking
 saikadon logon ke bich ek hotel se shuru hui yah baraat paas ke thane tak gai
 During this, countless eyes followed him
 darasal, police kii chhapemari ke baad pakade gaye ladke-ladakiyon kii yah parade dilli ke nazadik ghaziabad ke ek aise hotel se nikali, jisamen lambey samay se jismfaroshi kaa racket chalane kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 How old this racket is, can be gauged from the fact that when the police raided the hotel on Saturday morning, the police, from its different rooms, were not one, two, four, ten, but the entire 112 boys - Girls found in objectionable condition
 yahaan sabakuch maheenon se or khuleam chal rahaa tha
 But how was all this possible, despite the police and the law guards among the huge population? Well this is also an interesting story
 jismfaroshi kaa yah racket itnaa bada nikalegaa, yah police ne bhi nahin sochaa tha
 This is the reason that once the counting of people caught from the hotel started, then this count went on
 ant main halaat aise paidaa hue jaise yah giraftaar koi jismfaroshi ke adde par nahin, balki koi siyaasi raily main ho rahi ho
 The police have engaged such a suspicious couple in the raid that they themselves cannot understand how to arrest so many people and if they take them to the police station after arrest, then how
 lihaaza, police sabase pehle hotel ke kamaron se aapattijanak haalat main pakade gaye ladke-ladakiyon ko alag-alag bithaati he
 That means boys on one side and girls on the other
 chunki is maamle main badanaami kaa dar he, lihaaza pakade gaye sabhi ke sabhi log neeche baithte hi apana munh chipa lete hai
 Now the police start counting people one by one
 ek, do, teen, chaar, paanch
 
 
 And after counting the entire 112 people, the police also realize how big a hand they have killed
 lihaaza, ab vah sabhi ko yahaan se le jane ke liye na sirf alag se force, balki basen bhi mangavathi he
 Some, such as those who are usually arrested in rallies, are called to take political party workers to arrest and take them somewhere
 tab ek-ek kar 56 ladakon ko ek bas main or itani hi ladakiyon ko duusari bas main bithakar police thane ke liye ravaanaa hoti he
 Of course, of late, the police action has now brought relief to the people around
 vaise bhi abhi to police ne sirf chhapemari kar sandigdh jodon ko pakadaa he
 Which pair of love-mashuks, which of Jismphroosh and which illegitimate relationship is yet to be investigated
 dhandhebaajon main college girls bhi
 
 
 Was this business of shameless businessmen involved only in the process of slavery, or was there someone else who became a part of this procession? When the police raided this hotel in Ghaziabad, another story came to light
 is baraat main dhandhebaazon ke saath-saath college girls, profeshnals, house vife or duusare kai chehre benakaab hue
 When the Ghaziabad police raided the hotel in charge of running the racket of Jismfaroshi, many of the stories that were not thought of by the police came out, along with the expose of the businessmen of Jismfaroshi
 tamaam padtaal ke baad police ne un jodon ke khilaaf privansion of immoral trephiking act yani peeta kii dhaaraon ke tahat mukadmaa darj kiya, jo yahaan jismfaroshi ke iraade se hi is hotel ke kamare main pahunche the
 But the police also found such boys and girls, who wanted to spend two moments of comfort in the hotel room with their loved ones
 aise logon ko police ne muchalaka bharwakar jane diya
 However, the attitude of the hotel in this case was definitely exposed
 police kii maane, to is hotel main aise graahakon ko ghanton ke hisaab ke kamare die jate the, jinka rate 500 rupee se 2000 rupee ke bich hota tha
 In this regard, the necessary rules and regulations like i-card were also being ignored, but even couples who did not have an I-card, hotel guests could charge double the amount for giving them entry in rooms without identity card
 
 yahi vajah he ki police ne is hotel ke maalik or mulaazimon ke khilaaf bhi peeta ke tahat maamla darj kiya he
 However, during the investigation, the police did not find any such girls who have no connection with the business of prostitution
 lekin wo apane partner ke saath vaqt bitaane ke iraade se is hotel main aa pahunchi thim
 However, after this action, it has become clear that without the knowledge of the police, all this was not possible under the nose of the police
 baharhaal, ab is karrwai ke baad jahaan ilaake ke log khush hai, vahiin ye baat bhi saafe ho gai he ki kis tarah kuch khaas vajahon se vardeevaale bhi kai baar jaan-boojhkar kaanoon tode jane kii andekhi karte hai
 There are countless such bases of Jismfaroshi in Delhi and Jismfarishi in NCR, which the police are not even aware of
 sanyukt raashtra sangh yani yuano kii ek taji report kii maane, to dilli puure hindustan main jismfaroshi or maanav taskari ke sabase bade addon main se ek he
 In the dark streets of Delhi, there is that redlight area, where sometimes people are sold in this market by luring girls in the name of marriage, sometimes by luring them to get jobs
 phir inaki kismat main likhaa jaataa he wo kaala sach, jo inhen roj jite-ji maut kaa ehsaas karaata he
 The statistics of the sale and purchase of girls in Delhi NCR are truly shocking, that black truth is imprisoned in these figures, seeing and hearing which will land under your feet

 There were two types of reactions on social media about Kapri's post
 ek gut aisa tha jo yogi ke daawey ko bharose laayak nahin maan rahaa, vahiin doosraa gut ise sach maan rahaa tha
 The India Today anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found that there is no scope for doubt on Yogi's claim
 trump ne vastav main 2016 main america chunaav se pehle kaha tha ki wo gavarnence ke mudde par modi ke kuch kadamon ko apnaanaa chahenge
 Kapri's post was liked and retweeted by hundreds of people

 'obviously, Trump used the slogan to lure Indians living in America
 da washington postane bhi america chunaav ke dauraan trump par modi ke prabhaav kaa ullekh kiya
 This news website cited Trump talking about Modi during a rally in Edison
 website ke mutabik trump ne kaha, 'great main! main aisa karne ke liye unki saraahna karata hum
 i also look forward to doing so that the bureaucracy is severely removed here in America
 meraa vishwaas kiijie, hamen bhi isaki jarurat he
 Although it is not clear from Kapri's post what he wanted to say while tweeting the article written about Yogi, it is certain that the UP Chief Minister's claim about Trump was not a lie

 ghar main teen chizein sukh paidaa karti hai
 The color of the house, the wave of the house and the people living in the house

 Sometimes we bring some things in the house that increase discord in the house
 kuch khaas logon ke aane par bhi ghar main klesh bad jaataa he
 How to keep the color of the house right? - Most of the light and beautiful colors should be used in the house - Light yellow, pink or green color should be used in the living area - Orange color is most auspicious in the kitchen - Pink in the bed room , Purple or green shades should be used - the color of the roof should be white in any case - blue or blue shades should be used sparingly, so it would be better to use the house wave How to keep it right? - Waves are created from household items and from people - Do not stop the useless things in the house - Keep the right movement of light and air in the house - Eating stale in the house, keeping unused shoes slippers makes the waves worse - The sound of loud music, the screaming shout and the busyness of the house makes the waves ripple - worshiping the house in the morning and evening, Waves of the house are better with fragrance and chanting of mantra etc
 - Completely clean the house, do Amavasya - Do joint worship in the house one day a week, what should the people of the house pay attention to? Behavior and temperament are most important - waves are also formed from the people of the house and luck also - keep the behavior right among them - do not use profanity, do not be lazy - alcohol in the house Try science keep and do not organize gambling etc

 Chaudhary Babulal, a UP minister in the BSP and SP government, was known as a farmer leader
 ab vah bijepi main hai or fatehpur sikri loksabhaa kshetra se saansad bhi hai
 But his image has changed now
 ab ve kisaan netaa nahin rahe
 At least in the case of opposition to the land acquisition bill
 party badalane ke saath ve bhi badal gaye hai
 How the leader has changed? The political gathering of 67-year-old Chaudhary Babulal has been in the faith of the farmers
 agra hi nahin, aas-paas ke jilon main bhi unka prabhaav he
 a two-time MLA from Fatehpur Sikri and also a minister in the previous BSP, SP government
 2012 ke upi vidhansabha chunaav main rashtriya lok dal se tikat hasil kiya par haar gaye
 Appeared in all agitations in Agra and Fatehpur Sikri against the Land Acquisition Bill in 2010 and 2011
 lekin is loksabhaa chunaav main unhone bijepi kaa daaman tham liya
 Luck struck hard jat samikarnon kaa aankalan kar bijepi ne netaji ko fatehpur sikri se ummidavaar bana diya
 And they also won
 lekin tab se ve kisaan andolan se dur hai
 Modi is better describing the government's Land Acquisition Ordinance Amendment

 National President of the National Lok Dal and farmer leader Brijesh Chahar says that when no party asked, our party gave the ticket
 kisaan netaa hone kaa daawa karte rahe
 Pala changed before Lok Sabha and moved to BJP
 saansad ban gaye
 The farmers of the area hoped that they would reach the Parliament
 magar uske ulat ho rahaa he
 Chahar says that a person who is not educated, will put someone's favor in the house

 saansad choudhary babulal ke pratinidhi or unke putr rameshwar choudhary kehete hai ki ham party line ke mutabik kaam kar rahe hai
 We want the interest of farmers
 isliye hamane apni baat ko party or sangh ke madhyam se aalaa-kaman tak panhuchaya he
 Our government will take a decision in the interest of farmers only

 unhone 10 saal pehle hi ek makaan kharidne ke liye lone liya tha
 He could not repay the loan for the last few months

 Therefore his family was upset
 wo naa to maa ke ilaaj ke liye paise juta paa rahe the or naa hi bete-beti kii padhai kaa kharch uthaa paa rahe the
 Deepak's relative Ashwin Ranparia told that there was a conversation with Deepak Bhai three days ago, when he said that the business has been slow since Diwali
 unka kharchaa badhata ja rahaa he
 In this regard, District Superintendent of Police Sharad Singhal said that due to financial constraints in the preliminary inquiry, Deepak and his family are understood to have taken this step

 Due to this, many Gokshi shops along the border were also closed
 BSF started to close the biggest route of cattle smuggling
 There is a big decline in illegal animal smuggling along the india-bangladesh border
 biguef ke lagaataar chalaae ja rahe abhiyaan main pichley saal sitambar se ab tak pashchim bengal se tripura tak faili lagbhag 4,000 kilometre lambii seemaa par baari karrwai main lagbhag 500 bangladeshi taskar giraftaar hue
 At the same time, 45 BSF personnel have also been injured in this operation
 maveshi taskari ko rokane ke liye biguef ne sabase pehle apane ghar ko thik karte hue nichle rank se lekar aiji kii post tak ke apane lagbhag do darjan bhrasht adhikariyon kii pahchaan kii
 At the same time, such officers managing on the border were excluded
 sutron ne kaha ki biguef pramukh ne khud is abhiyaan ke liye samarth adhikariyon ko chunaa or unhen pashu-taskari rokane kaa kaam saunpa gaya
 Patrolling was increased from the ferry
 vahiin desh ke andar taskari aparaadhon ko sanchalit karne waalon par khufia najar rakhi jane lagi
 To stop illegal smuggling of cattle, BSF first started closing the largest route of cattle smuggling
 biguef kii pahal ne haryana se assam tak acchhee tarah punap chuke taskari girohon kii qamar tod kar rakh di or iske kaaran seemaa par sthit kai gokshi kii dukaane bhi band ho gayi
 In a statement to news agency IANS, BSF Director General Rajinikanth Mishra said, "this is a big change from effective patrolling along the border and the introduction of stricter legal action against smugglers"
 unhone aage kaha, "pashu taskar praathmik maarg ke taur par seemaa par yojanabaddh tareeke se apekshaakrit lanbaa nadi vaala maarg apanaate the
 BSF personnel patrolling the river marked and closed such a route
 "biguef adhikariyon ke anusaar, bharat-bangladesh seemaa par sirf 5,000 rupee main taskari kar le jaai gai gaay bangladesh pahunchane par 50,000 rupee main bikati he
 The bsf's action on the thriving cattle smuggling industry was also discussed in this meeting held on 11 August under the chairmanship of Fisheries and Livestock Minister of Bangladesh Ashraf Ali Khan
 mantri ne sweekaar kiya ki bharat se hone vaali pashuon kii taskari main 96 pratishat tak giravat ai he
 Evidence of a decline in animal trafficking is also found in a report in the Bangladesh newspaper Dhaka Tribune
 is report ke anusaar bangladesh meet utpaadan main aatmanirbhar ho gaya he or dhire-dhire bangladesh meet kaa aayaat kam kar rahaa he
 However, the BSF says that Bangladesh has not admitted to having many abattoirs in the border districts
 lekin yah jarur sweekaar kiya he ki maveshi taskari ke aankadon main badi giravat ai he
 Earlier, after the election of Banaras seat, BJP PM candidate Narendra Modi and Murli Manohar Joshi came to know about the estrangement, now a similar situation has arisen with Lucknow seat too
 darasal, is seat se party ke adhyaksh rajnath singh chunaav ladanaa chaahate hai par maujuuda bijepi saansad lalji tandon apni seat chhodane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 According to sources, Lalji Tandon has said that he can leave this seat only for Narendra Modi
 is vivaad par somvaar ko lalji tandon ne safai di
 He said, 'neither did i refuse anyone for the Lucknow seat nor did anyone offer to contest from here itself
 haalanki, modi ke lakhanu se chunaav ladane kaa prastaav khud hi rakh chukaa he or main piem pad ke ummidavaar kii jeet ke liye puri shakti lagaaungaa
 i do not mind his candidature
 aaj kii taarikh is sambandh main mujhe party se koi aadesh nahin mila na hi kisi vyakti ne mujhase ye kaha he ki vah yahaan se chunaav ladanaa chahta he
 Nor am i claiming for any other seat
 to vivaad kya he? aisa kuch bhi nahin he
 'it is noteworthy that Rajnath Singh is currently an MP from Ghaziabad seat in Uttar Pradesh
 haalanki is baar ve is seat se ladane ke icchhuk nahin he
 There is talk of him contesting from Lucknow
 duusari taraf, varanasi se narendra modi ko ummidavaar banane kii khabaron se naakhush murali manohar joshi ab baikfoot par aa gaye hai
 He told the party leadership on Sunday that whatever decision the party will take, they will treat him like a disciplined soldier
 joshi ne ummid jataai ki party ke faisle se na to pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar kii pratishtha kam hogi or na hi party kii chunavi sambhaavnaaon ko nuksaan pahonchega
 While denying the news of the poster war between Modi and his supporters in Varanasi, he described it as a media product

 "on June 6, two very frightened five-year-olds said this in a panicked voice to the inquiry committee appointed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court
 in bacchon ne dil dahala dene vaali yaatnaaon kii apni daastaan sunai, jisamen jabaran mukh maithun karwaane jaisaa krity bhi shaamil tha
 The young children, who have recited their painful tragedy, are among the 103 women and children who have been freed from a private shelter home named Apna Ghar in Rohtak district of Haryana
 rashtriya bal adhikaar sangrakshan ayog (ensipisiar) ke sadsy 58 varshiya vinod kumaar tikku ne jab 9 may ko shelter home par chapa maaraa to jo najaara unhone vahaan dekha use dekhakar unki pratikriya kuch is tarah thi, ''vibhats or sharmnaak
 The statements recorded by Tikku and then later on June 5-6 by Chandigarh lawyers Anil Malhotra and Sudipti Sharma were even more frightening
 aarope he ki mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ke ghar se mahaj teen kimi kii duuri par jaswanti devi or uske saathi vastav main ek ''dahshatbhra ghar'' chalaa rahe the
 The 28-page report submitted by Malhotra and Sharma to the High Court on June 12 reads, "children were physically abused, beaten brutally, often kept naked, forced to drink alcohol and They were regularly employed as agricultural and construction laborers
 ''ve likhte hai, ''paanch se das saal ke kuch bacchon ne un logon par mukh maithun karwaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 "it is written in the report that Jaswanti's son-in-law Jai Bhagwan and driver Satish used to do many more with those living there
 badi umr kii ladkiyaan or jawan auraton ko niyamit taur par nashe kii davaaiyaan khilaai jaatin, unhen jabardastee samalangik sambandh banane or 'pulisavaalon or bahari mardon' ke saath hambistar hone ke liye majaboor kiya jaataa tha
 Many of the victims exposed sexual relations with 'foreigners' in local guest houses and hotels
 ab panipat ke madar terresa charity mishan main bhej di gai ek yuvati ne bataaya, ''jab bhi ladakiyon ko jai bhagwaan or satish ke saath shelter home se baahar bheja jaataa to jaswanti kahati thi, genhu kaatane gai he
 He also said that all kinds of sexual activity and even every act with young children were recorded on camera
 30 june ko jari hui ensipisiar kii report kahati he ki apana ghar se chhudaayi gai ladakiyon main se kam se kam chaar echivi positive pai gai hai
 Children born to women living in shelter homes were sold illegally
 ensipisiar kaa anumaan he ki pichley teen saal main apana ghar se takreeban 41 log laapata hue hai
 29 people still do not know anything
 shelter home kii cargujariyon se bilkul bekhbar haryana sarkaar ne jasanvati ko 23 march ko indira gandhi mahila shakti puraskaar se sammanit kiya tha
 She was given a certificate as well as one lakh
 kaa puraskaar bhi diya gaya
 But even more surprisingly, it took a month for the Women and Child Development Minister Geeta Bhukkal to withdraw the award on 11 June, even after the disclosure of these dreadful things
 16 june ko rohtak jila court main pesh kiye jane par jaswanti ne shekhi baghaarte hue kaha, ''koi meraa kuch nahin bigaad saktaa
 i am not afraid of anyone
 '' usne rajya police ko chunauti di ki agar himmat he to uske khilaaf aarope sabit karke dikhaae
 Perhaps more frightening than the horrific events inside Apna Ghar is the loose and sluggish attitude of the Haryana government
 jaswanti, jai bhagwaan, satish or chaar anya logon ko giraftaar karne kii bajaae rohtak ke police upaadheekshak tula ram ke adheen bani shuruaati jaanch team in reporton ke kaaran ki ladakiyon ke yon utpeedan main kuch sthaneey police vaale bhi shaamil hai, apane haath peeche khinchne main lagi thi
 On 6 June, Director General of Police R

 The broker gave the additional Director General of Police M
 es
 a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed under the leadership of Mann and assured any policeman involved in the incident to be punished 'harshly'
 yah vishesh jaanch dal bhi nihaayat phiseddi sabit hua
 They were also not successful in acquiring the accused's mobile phone or their computers or any other recording device
 sirf itnaa hi nahin, haryana prashasan ne ensipisiar ke nirdeshon ko dhata bataane kii koi kasar nahin chodi
 He sent 103 victims rescued from 'apna Ghar' to 12 different shelter homes in seven cities of Haryana
 ek vakil jor dekar kehete hai, ''saaf jaahir he ki yah kadam jaanch ko kamjor karne kii ek chaal thi
 Then the state government decided to hand over this investigation to CBI
 lekin ek pakhwada biit jane ke baad bhi sibiai ko jaanch saunpane kii prakriya afasarshahi ke kagaji jhmelon main hi uljhi hui he
 These shocking revelations are an example of the extent to which people can go to private shelter homes
 desh bhar main bal sangrakshan sansthaanon main bad rahaa shoshan yah bataata he ki puri vyavastha hi bhrasht ho chuki he

 i lost my parents in my childhood and labored in a slaughterhouse under compulsion

 But writing was like everything to him
 matiani ji kaha karte the ki 'vah to kaagaj par 'kheti' karte hai
 'and indeed it was so
 shailesh matiani kii ginati desh ke sarvshereshth kathakaron main hoti he
 He gave Hindi literature the best story collections like chiles, thirst and stones, past and other stories, sheep and shepherds, kanya and other stories, snow and rocks, 'nach, Jamure, Nach', Maimud, Savitri and Gopuli Gafuran, Chand women
 The city of Nagavallari, the confluence of the fifty-two rivers, maya-sarovar, Encounter, Ramkali, Hawaldar, Uttarkand have given novels, as a writer, Bela Hui Aber, Radius, Mainstream Wall, occasionally, also gave excellent works related to deliberative and folk narratives such as the question of the national language
 aalochak giriraaj kishor ne unki kahaniyon kaa moolyankan karte hue unhen premchand se aage kaa upanyaaskaar bataaya tha
 Rajendra Yadav also once commented on his stories, saying that Matiani is the only writer among us who has more than ten unique and not only excellent, classics, whereas usually writers have two or three
 
 koi bahut pratibhashali hua to had se had paanch
 Shailesh Matiyani not only gave a new height to the regional literature of Hindi, but also gave many memorable characters to the Hindi story
 aaj unki punyatithi par sahitya ajtak par padhie unki yah kaaljayi kahani 'mamud'
 This story is part of the story collection published by Prabhat Prakashan by his name
 ek muslim parivaar main bakre ko centrebindu bana maanviya samvednaa ko ujagar karne vaali hindi sahitya kii apane tarah kii yah anuthi kahani he
 Story: Maimood - Shailesh Matianimahmud again started tying, then Jaddan twisted his right ear, turning his face towards him
 thik thoothne par thappad maarthi hui boli, ‘‘bahut mullah dopiaja kii-si dadhi kya hilaataa he, ssaale! duungi ek kantop to sab shekhi nikal jaaegi
 Neither piddy nor piddy broth, bitches roam very bull
 i suleman kii ammaa, ab meraa munh kya dekhati he, roti-voti kuch laa
 Has your work been done? See, what a great plate gives! All of this also goes to the color of the plate
 ’’apni baat puri karte-karte, jaddan ne kaan einthna chhodkar, uski gardan par haath pherana shuru kar diya
 Now Mahmud also slowly turned, and raised his head high and filled the ear of Jaddan in the mouth, she shouted, "oh o Sulaiman's mother, look at the eyes of this devil!" Chugd is avenging his ears
 i mamud, ssaale, daant na lagaana, nahin to teri khayr nahin
 Okay, you brought the bread? Ari, they look desi rather than ration wheat
 laa idhar
 See, you bastard, how was my ear filled? Now you will not believe, Rahiman! This brother-in-law is just as passionate as humans! ”“ The animal is dumb, Amraf of Sharafat! However, man definitely finds a sense of emotion in it
 tum to is naamuraad bakre kaa itnaa khyal rakhti ho, maan apni aulad kaa kya rakhti hogi
 "rahiman had caught both the rotis and the goat was now busy chewing the pieces of bread
" ek tukdaa vah jab puri tarah nigal letaa, to phir se jaddan ko apane singon se thelne lagata tha
 "god has not given you any thing in the name of patience
" ’’ kehete hue jaddan ne phir apana rukh rahiman kii ore kar liya, ‘‘insaan jab boodha ho jaataa he, tab koi aisa use chahie, jo uske ‘aa’ kehane se aae or ‘ja’ kehane se jaae
 Suleman's Amma knows the world of the world i have only one unsuccessful maimud, the brother-in-law, who should make a voice from the prophet's street in Khuldabad, that 'ma'amud! Ma'amud! Ma'amud! ' So Chugd arrives at Nakhosakone's litter and turns around and does 'bain-bain', he comes to the race to me, what do you know! Just, when my brother-in-law comes out at Kunabaparspi, my God will not listen to God
 
 
 
 Even if i make a sound, i will 'bank' once in a while, even if i later run towards my Amma at double speed
 
 
 
 When he finished talking, he laughed hard, and a glow was seen in his piercing and brown colored teeth
 jarjar, talle lage or badrang burke main se budhaape kaa maaraa hua cheharaa ughaade rahati he jaddan, to chudilon kii-si surat nikal aati he
 "when you start telling the story of the murders of this village, you, Sharafat's Amma, Mirganjwalis - the glow comes in you!" After taking a look at his far-flung goat, Rahiman joked and She also laughed
 ‘‘tum khud ab koun si jawan rah gai ho, rahiman? aakhir tajurbekaar aurat ho!’’ tum jaano, ek ye bejubaan jaanavar or duusare maasoom bachche- bas, ye do hai, jo insaan kii umr, uske jism or uski khubsuurati-badsoorti pe nahin jate, balki sirf neki-badi or nafrat-muhabbat ko pahachaanate hai
 Banno of our Sharafat has been seen by you a thousand times, Haji Lalmuhammad of beedwals or sherwanis will also find it difficult to compare it in beauty and noor, Rahiman! 
 
 magar tu ye jaan ki meraa mamud uski shakal dekhte hi munh pher ke, pichaadi ghuma detaa he
 There is the perplexed Kaiti, 'nakabile Barhru Boo Khata' and that 'amma will leave our children, but this goat will not be left untouched
 ’
 
 
 i am Kaiti, curse is your beauty and beauty
 lakh pouder-itr chhidke tu, meraa mamud tere kahe pe thook ke nahin degaa
 
 
 
 jaanavar or bachche to insaan kii chamadi nahin, niyat dekhte hai, niyat! majaal he ki nawabazadi ke haathon se ek gassa mere mamud ke munh kii taraf chalaa jaae! tujh pe khuda raham karegaa, rahiman! dekhnaa, pehle to teen, nahin do pathiye to kahin gaye hi naa!
 
 
 God swear, you have put these rotis in my stomach, not this nomad
 
 
 
 Locals, just as government cattle, come and go
 ye nahin hota kamaniyaton se ki do rotiyaan yaa mutthi bhar dana bhi saath lete aaen
 Hey brother, the maimood that withers in the sunshine of innocent children coming back to the game, is visible only to the persecution or to God above
 tu jaan, pichley baras kii bakreed ke aas-paas paidaa hua tha
 Now the memory has weakened, but perhaps, it must have been born on the day of Jumme or Jumerat and now it has been three and a half months up the year
 ’’jaddan mahmud kii peeth par haath pherate hue, khatole par se uth khadi hui thi ki ‘‘acha, suleman kii ammaa, chaluungi
 It is time for the prayers of Shaperf's father's duper
 suna he, aaj shahanaz ke abba log bhi aanevaale hai raibareli se
 
 
 "then Rahiman said that" You say it is a year and a half and a half, but looking at its rags and feet, no one will be below three
no less than bees-pachchis ser se kam gosht nahin nikalegaa is bakre main
 Looks like you did not raise grass other than bread and grains? ”although Rahiman said everything in praise of Mahmud, the whole face of Jaddan went up like a frown,“ Ari o Rahiman, fire your In the moo matlab nikal gaya tera, to mere mamud kaa gosht tolane baith gai? tera khabind to badhai he, ri, ye kasaayiyon kii gharavaaliyon kii-si baaten kahan se sikhi ho? yaa khuda, haya or raham naam kii cheez inasaanon main rahi hi naa! goshtkhoron kii najar or kasaai kii churi main koi fark thode naa hota he
 Ari Rahiman, i say - do not talk such ridiculous things in front of you and take your goat somewhere else in a jiggle
 koi susraa puure khuldabad main meraa ek mamud hi thode thika liye baitha he
 
 
 
 ’’‘‘ari jaddan, ab bade gharaanon kii beghamon ke-se tevar bahut naa dikhaao! bakra na ho gaya susraa, hatimtai ho gaya tumhaare vaaste
 "rahiman also rebuked and said in a sarcastic voice," That which is a phrase, you must also have heard - How long will Amma of Bakare pray? And, persistent, the hearer must also learn to listen
 hamase pucho, to hakeekat ye he ki tumhaare to aulad hui nahin
 Neither did you allow the stepsons to come close to the heart, nor did the milk be dropped in your chest from those nomads
 bas, ye hi vajah he ki tum is dadhijar bakre ko ‘meraa mamud, meraa mamud!’ pukaar ke apni jalan bujhaati ho
 
 
 
 ’’jaddan aage badhati hui, aise ruk gai, jaise bichchhu ne kaat liya ho
 After turning his face in anger, the helplessness turned dark, "rahiman, who has hurt me, God will understand you
 or rai gaya ‘bakre kii ammaa’ vaala muhaavara, to insaan kii ammaa kii hi dua kahan bahut lambey tak asar karti he? karti hoti, to tera bada betaa suleman aaj jawan ho chukaa hota or tu sirf naam kii ‘suleman kii ammaa’ naa rah jaati! ek lamaha chup kar, rahiman! khuda mujhe maaf kare, main tere upar beete kaa majaak udaana nahin chaahati thi -sirf itnaa kaina chaahati hoon, dard insaan ko apane jajbaton kaa hota he
 Which does not have an emotional relationship, what is his promise? 
 
 suleman kii ammaa, itnaa main bhi jaanati hoon ki bakre ne aakhir katnaa-hi-katnaa he
 Which goat was saved from the villages today? 
 
 magar meri itani iltaja jarur he paravar-digaar se -meri najaron ke saamne naa kate
 
 
 
 sharafat ke abba se kai bhi chuki hoon, is naamuraad ko jab bechney lago, to pehle to shahar kaa -kam-se-kam mohalle kaa faasla jarur rakhana
 
 
 
 or wo teri baat main jarur maan leti hoon ki khuda ke yahan bakre kii ammaa kii dua bahere ke kaanon main ajaan he
 This is also fine, the stepsons have not spared me the real respect of Amma, this cana will have to go to hell in lieu
 
 
 magar muhabbat jo mujhe is jaanavar ne di, ammaa-abba ne di hogi, to di hogi
 "no answer could be made with Rahiman
 vah sirf yah dekhati rah gai ki jaddan ne burke ke pallu se apni ankhen ponchhin or bakre kii peeth thapthapaati hui, apane ghar kii taraf bad gai
 By the time Jaddan reached home, Ashraf had sat on Namaz
 paakhaane kii bagal kii sankari kothri main bakre ko band karte hue, jaddan boli, ‘‘sharafat ke abba duper kii namaaj par baith chuke
 Now where will you hit me? shaam ke vakt nikaaloongi
 Loo started running this year
 ’’khaane par baithe, to ashraf bole, ‘‘sharafat kii ammaa, raibareliwaalon kaa sandeshaa aayaa tha, tumhen maaloom hi hoga
 We are walking in trouble, but we are not crying in front of the guests
 izzat dekhni padati he
 There was talk with Sharafat and Zaheer
 ladke thik hi kah rahe the ki ‘abba, bazaar main das rupye kilo kaa bhav he
 Five-six people will live by the peeler of Shehnaaz, and it is necessary to call people of their own relations ten-five in good and bad
 dusron kii daavat khate hai, to apni shame rakhni hi padegi
 'sharafat used to say' Ask Amma and see
 ’ tumhaare bakre ko katwa lete, to ghar kii cheez ghar main kaam aa jaati
 There will be no less than forty-fifty in the market
 khaali roganjosh ubaal dene se to kaam chalegaa nahin
 Kebabs and koftas make very good
 pichley baras jab ham log raibareli gaye the, shahanaz ke abba ne do to bakre hi katwa die the or murgiyon kii ginati koun kare
 Four to five days would have been accumulated, but the meat became bitter after eating
 garib ham log unke mukaable main jarur hai, lekin jaruri nahin ki apni kamaniyati kaa saboot bhi den
 "ashraf was getting cast and Jaddan's face was being pulled
 ghar ke sabhi jaanate the ki ammaa se bakre ko nikaalnaa itnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 While Ashraf was talking, Shahnaz was secretly feeding his child casserole and was afraid that Amma would not explode like the sky
 munh uskaa duusari ore tha, lekin kaan jaddan kii ore lage hue the
 As Jaddan said in a slow but bitter voice, "sharafat's Laila has come to the death of my mother
" 
 
 
 "shehnaaz said in a low voice," Amma, don't give us this gift
 ye baithe hai saamne, puch lijie, ham to lagaataar mane karte rahe hai ki ammaa bahut jajbaati hai, unako koi na chede
 
 
 
 khurafaate ye karenge or ammaa kaa gussa apane beton kii jagah, ham bekasooron par giregaa
 "there was such a feeling of humility and respect in Shahnaz's saying that the stance of Jaddan changed," i have to take some of the Sharafat's abbot, a goat with a bandha! Rahiman was rightly saying, 'to what extent can the mother of a goat be able to celebrate well!'
 
 
 meri khwaahish to sirf itani he ki is saale naamuraad jaanavar ke uthne-baithne, hagane-mutane kii baaten bhi meri yaaddaasht kaa hissaa ban gai hai
 There was a little lamb, then you yourself saw it and have intercepted a thousand times that Amma makes her goat like a child
 kya karti, sardi itani padati thi or bina maan kaa ye baccha tha!
 
 
 Well, my advice is that if the guests come, their respect is our respect
 jahir se kahie, kahin udhar katre-condailganj kii taraf ke kasaayiyon ke haath bech aae or iske paison se chaahe phir gosht le aae, yaa doosraa bakra kharid laae
 Its meat will also smell or, khuda jaanata he, maine to apana ji ab khud hi kasaayiyon-sa bana liya he ki is haramjade ko to katnaa hi he
 i was the Owl Stalker, who gave it a dose and made it thick for the meat-eaters
 ’’haalaanki sari baaten jaddan ne kaaphi thande swar main or udaseenta baratate hue kahin thim, lekin sabhi jaanate the ki cruddhata uske jism main is samay khun kii tarah daud rahi hogi
 Amidst his frustration and indifference, standing in the room like a deciduous leaf falling down, Shahnaz said, "amma's main motive is to say that goat's meat will boo
" aap in logon se kah dijiega ki ammaa se jid na karen
 "ashraf Mian took a long breath and said," If i see this, the days of old begin to be remembered
 sharafat or jahir jab chote the, tabhi badi chali gai thi
 It never allowed us to realize that the wife of old has died or the mother of children! You guys are watching now, now it is neither available nor there! It is good if the goat is cut
 maar paaglon kii tarah dhoop main maari-maari phirti hai
 That Susra never remains a hideout
 kate, to thode din hai-tobaa kar legi or kya! roj-roj kii fajihat to dur hogi
 Seeing Amma in front of the guests, don't wear a burqa! What is the death of time! You see, she got up in awe
 jab tum logon kii umr kii thim, tab basmati kii kismein dekhi jaati thim ki zarda pilav ke liye barikwali basmati ho
 Now it is to yellow the rice of the ration and insult the turmeric
 ’’isi vakt bada betaa jahir aa gaya, to usko sari sthiti bataai gai
 He said with carelessness, "you people are increased in vain
 ammaa ko main samajha loonga
 Now is this the age to run after their goat? If we are running on the road, we are left ashamed
 bhukhi-pyaasi or fatehaal daudi chali jaayengi, meri maniye, to saleem kasaai ko bulavaa len or mehmaanon ke aane se pehle bo khaal utarkar, keemaa kutake rakh de
 Put the pudding in the pulao and at this time the chests of the chest and neck will be fine
 jo khatir ghar kii cheez se ho sakati he, bazaar se do-dhai sau main bhi nahin hogi
 Zubaid's Amma used to say that she would give sola rupees, thirty-thirty rupees, perhaps, she was also going to give the shehnaaz that 'amma will spare her sons, not us
 ’ ab in bevakoofon ko koun samajhaae ki do kilo ghaslate or tel-masala karte-karte sau rupye nikal jaayenge
 The rice of ration will not be used for guests in the casserole, and the basmati of the manner is not less than four-and-a-half to five times
 insaan ko apana vakt or sahuuliyat dekh ke chalanaa chahie, jajbaton par chalane ke din lad gaye
 "'" Say well, son! i also have the same opinion
 jaraa tum ammaa se milakar, oonch-neech samajha do
 Stubborn, of course, but not mindless
 ’’ kehete hue ashraf miyaan uth khadey hue, to unke ghutanon ke chatkhane kii aawaaj saaf-saaf sunai de gai
 Zaheer's housewife stood up saying "you guys start, let me wash my hands off Abba Hazur
" ’’khaanaa kha chukne par jahir sidhe bheetar ke kamare main gaya ki ammaa soi hongi, lekin shahanaz ne bataaya, ‘‘yon kahkar nikal gai hai ki jaraa rizvi sahab ke ghar tak jaayengi
 Their house was gutted last week
 kahkar gai hai ki shaayad shaam ho jaae, der se lautengi
 i think Amma has understood that the goat no longer survives, to participate in the heat is an excuse
 ghar se dur rahanaa chaahati hongi
 Shehnaaz wanted to laugh softly, but just remained depressed
 jahir ne baahar nikalakar, apane gyaarah-baarah saal ke bade ladke se kaha, ‘‘jubaid, jaraa saleem ko bulaakar laaiyo
 It is fine if the guests are clean by the time they arrive
 jubaid kii ammaa, bhai, tum log jaraa baharwala cameraa mehmaanon ke liye thik-thaak kar dena
 The Abba people of Shahnaz should not complain of any kind of deficiency
 bechaare har fasal par chale aate hai or har baat kaa lihaaj rakhte hai
 You treat yourself with love more than your real daughter
 tum donon jane pyaaj or masaale bagaiyrah piskar taiyaar kar lenaa
 The rest of the market will be able to bear the brunt
 saleem aa jaae, to usase kah dena, gand jaraa si bhi na chute aangan main
 To wipe khun ke dhabbe vagairah dekhengi, to ammaa or bigadengi
 If you start saying something to people, then tell it, Abba of Zubaid forcefully got it cut
 main unhen samajha loonga
 "only after realizing that the clock had passed all night in the evening, Jaddan returned and passed through the street, into the narrow courtyard behind the house
 khatola giraakar us par let gai or aas-paas ke neem andhere main apane-aapako chipa lene kii koshish main ankhen band kar leen
 The guests had arrived and the conversation between them and each other was also heard here in the backyard
 choti bacchon ko baahar lekar ai, to shahanaz ne dekha or kareeb aakar, paanv dabaati hui boli, ‘‘abba aa gaye hai
 As soon as you came, you were asking about how Amma has asked, how are you
 kabhi raibareli kii taraf aane kii iltaja karvaa rahi hai
 i also told Abba that this time i will come with Amma
 ammaa, tum khaanaa kahan khaaogi? mehmaanon kaa dastarkhan to vahiin baahar baithke main bichhega
 Everyone was talking about eating and drinking quickly
 koi majahabi kism kii film shahar main kahin lagi hui he!’’‘‘mere liye do rotiyaan yaheen bhijwa dena
 And remember, do not send any meat or cheese or casserole
 meraa na ji thik he, na pet
 Just send Zubaid, i will get him some
 tum sab log aaraam se khao-pio
 Don't worry about me ab to koi sardi naa rahi
 i will sleep here
 apane abba hujur se meraa salaam kaina or kaina ki subah dua-salaam hogi, abhi ammaa kaa ji thik nahin
 "shahnaz felt that the sound of stubbornness had become a bit like when he died
 nihaayat halaki or bejaan
 She wanted to try to alleviate her apathy by talking a few things, but kept quiet with the fear that the atmosphere of the whole house would change if the grief gathered inside broke out in the form of anger
 aaj ke vakt ko to ab yon hi tal jane dena acha he
 Returning he told, then both Zaheer and Ashraf Mian turned away
 ‘‘ham logon ne to har kshan yahi koshish kii he ki kahin se us naamuraad bakre kii koi cheez ammaa ko dikhe hi nahin
 She has become so serious, as if the goat's halted head is hanging in the courtyard
 kah rahi thim, gosht-pilav vagaira kuch mat bhejnaa
 "shahnaz said," Ashraf Mian stood up
 bole, ‘‘jab use khilaanaa ho, hamen bula lenaa
 Why, brother Zubaid, where are you taking Tashreef? Just be close to the guests in the meeting
 ’’‘‘chachaaji ne pichhawaade bheja tha, badi ammaa ke paas
 They have given us four arrows to go, bring potato vegetable from Shambhu Pandat shop
 ’’‘‘abe, idhar laa chavanni
 Go, ask the guests for water
 ammaa ko ham dekh lenge
 Shehnaz son, do this, give us a plate with casserole and a large bowl with meat
 ham le jaakar samajha denge
 Really, a very stupid kind of woman
 jahir, tum baahar baithke main dastarkhaane bichhawane main lago
 Take one or two boys apart from Sharafat
 ’’pilav kii thali or gosht kaa katoraa shahanaz ne hi pahunchaa diya
 Putting it next to Khatole, she immediately returned on the pretext of bringing water
 ashraf miyaan ne kareeb se maathaa chuaa or bole, ‘‘kyon, bhai, aise kyon leti ho? tabiyat to thik he naa? ari suno, saare kiye-karaae par mitti na daalo
 If you stay angry then all the hospitality will fade
 sara ghar kebab-gosht udaae or tum us shanbhu pandat ke yahan ke panivale aalu mangavaao, ye to ham logon ko juuti maarane ke barobar he
 
 
 
 aisi bhi kya baat ho gai, jo tumne khatiya pakad lee? gosht se tumhen kabhi parhez rahaa nahin
 Bread without broth does not descend down your throat
 ab is had tak jajbaati banane se to koi phayda nahin
 After all, the goats whose meat you have been eating till date had no four horns! 
 
 lo, shahanaz khaanaa de gai he
 The meat is really very shameful
 jahir to doosraa bakra bhi foundne gaya, magar lautakar yahi kehane laga ki ‘abba, apana bechney jaao to sau ke pachaas denge or dusron kaa kharidne jaao to pachaas ke sau maangenge
 'you know the internal condition of the house at this time
 
 
 
 "arousal arose as if a dead corpse was standing in the cemetery
" tikhi aankhon se ashraf miyaan kii ore usne dekha or aawaaj mehmaanon tak na pahunche, is tarah dabaakar boli, ‘‘jahir ke abba, naseehaten dene aae ho? meri takalif tum log samajhoge? rizvi ke yahan ghanton padi rahi hoon, to kaise yahi mere tasabbur main aata rahaa ki ab tum log mere mamud ke sir ko dhad se kaise juda kar rahe hoge- kaise uski khaal khinch rahe hoge- kaise uskaa gosht pakaa rahe hoge- jaar-jaar roti rahi hoon or rizvi kii bibi yun samaj ke mujhe samajhaae ja rahi he ki main uske badanaseeb bhai kii bevakt kii maut pe ro rahi hoon
 Today, the in-laws used to repeatedly fill the ears in the mouth every morning and i would push on the snout
 main kya jaanun ki badanaseeb chupake se kaan main yahi kahana chahta he ki ‘ammaa, aaj ham chale jaayenge
 
 
 ! ' You will understand how my trouble will always remember 'maimud' on my lips and will end? '"the persecution wept bitterly for a long time
 ashraf miyaan hakkaa-bakka baithe rahe
 He could not understand how the situation was possible now! After all, they decided that it would be better to take food quietly
 vah thali-katoraa uthaate ki jaddan jaharbujhi aawaaj main bol uthi, ‘‘tum bedardon se ye bhi naa hua ki main awwal darje kii goshtkhor aurat jab kai rahi hoon ki ‘bete shahanaz, hamen gosht-vosht naa dena,’ to isaki koi to vajah hogi? or jahir ke abba, insaan dadhi badha lene se hi pir nahin ho jaataa
 What would you tell me that all goats have two horns! Even Nadida knows this
 duniya main to saare insaan bhi khuda ne do seengvaale bakron kii tarah do haath-do panwvaale banaae hai? lekin aurat to tabhi rand hoti he, jab uskaa apana khasm marataa he! ammaa to tabhi apni chaati kootati he, jab uskaa apana baccha juda hota he!
 
 
 i also know that there were no headlines in my maid, but i know that you would not understand my pain as much as i thought unlucky, nor your son
 
 
 ! samajhate hote, to kya kisi hakim ne bataaya tha ki mehmaanon ko isi bakre kaa gosht khilaanaa or tum bhi bhakosna, nahin to najla-zukam ho jayega? jahir ke abba, usulon kaa tum pe tota nahin, magar is vakt ab hamen bahut jaleel na karo
 Tell Shahnaz, take it away, otherwise i will throw it there! Tell Zubaid, now there is no need to bring vegetables from Pandit's hair
 meraa pet to tum logon kii naseehaton se hi bhar chukaa
 "ashraf Mian bowed down and lifted the plate and bowl, came back," "take it, son! God does not even have the power to convince a stubborn woman
 use uske haal par chhod, mehmaanon kii phikr karo

 parmaanu hathiyaaron ke aatankwaadiyon ke haath padane kii duniya bhar main jataai ja rahi chintaa ke bich taliban ne kaha he ki pakistan ke parmaanu pratishthanon par hamale kii koi yojana nahin he, kyonki yah ekmaatr muslim raashtra he, jiske paas aise hathiyaar hai
 To avenge the death of Osama bin Laden, the Taliban has intensified a violent campaign in Pakistan and there have been fears that the country's nuclear weapon could become an easy target
 ‘da waal street jarnal’ ne khabar di he ki taliban ke pravaktaa ehsanulla ehsaan ne kaha ki pakistan ekmaatr parmaanu hathiyaar sampann raashtra he or is tathy ko badalane kaa samooh kaa koi iraadaa nahin he
 The newspaper said the Taliban, however, intended to capture Pakistan and its weapons
 uttar-purv kii simaaon ko baandhna aasaan nahinjangalon or nadiyon ke sahare hoti he ghuspaithpakistan se zyada bangladesh, myanmar se desh main ghuspaith hoti he
 This infiltration takes place in the country by taking advantage of forests, mountains, river nets and hard valleys in the areas of North East
 ye baaten kolkata main yojit india today conklev east purv senadhyaksh general bikram singh, leftinent general shaukeen chouhan or sadak parivahan mantralay ke adishnal secretary shambhu singh ne kahi
 General Bikram Singh said that in some places in the North East, there are boundaries where it is not easy to tie the boundaries
 baad lagaana sambhav nahin he
 Checkposts are difficult to make
 hamane iske baavjood kai pratibandh lagaae hai
 But the most intrusions are from Bangladesh and Myanmar
 general bikram singh ne kaha ki mujhe yaad he ki 2012 main biguef kii 82 batalians in simaaon par tainaat thi
 There are 1008 border posts on this entire border
 lekin baad lagaana aasaan nahin tha
 You can never make complete security arrangements on borders with such terrible conditions
 ghuspaith ko puri tarah se nahin roak sakate
 How to build fences in rivers, where nothing flows: Shambhukar, Additional Secretary of the Ministry of Transport, Shambhu Singh said that there is a border of about 4300 km with Bangladesh
 kareeb 1300 kilometre kii seemaa to nadiyon main hai
 The flow of rivers is very fast
 yahaan kuch bhi lagaana asambhav he
 There is infiltration from Naga Hills too but it is very less
 lekin jab aap bangladesh se ghuspaith dekhenge to pataa chalegaa ki kareeb ek darjan se zyada jagahon se ghuspaith hoti he
 That too through rivers
 vah bhi behad khatarnaak ilaakon se
 It is very difficult to prevent infiltration from these rivers, forests and mangroves
 bharat main kaam miltaa he isliye log karte hai ghuspaithh general vikram singhmexico se log america naukari ke liye aate he
 Similarly, there is a job in India

 It is not in Bangladesh
 isliye log bhaagate hai bharat kii taraf
 If people allow you to come in the morning and go back in the evening then maybe some problem is solved
 iskaa doosraa bada kaaran he global varming
 People are also upset due to rising temperature

 input language input: bhashaa Actor Ali Fazal, who has appeared in films like 'three Idiots', 'always Kabhi Kabhi' and 'fukrey', believes that the film 'bobby Jasoos' is his biggest break
 shuukravaar ko relies hui film main vidya baalan mukhya bhoomika main hai
 Before the release of the film, Ali was upset that he could not attend the promotion of 'bobby Detective' due to the busy shooting of his next film 'khamoshiyan'
 ali ko yah jaanakar bada jhatka laga ki 'bobi jasoos' ke pramotion main unki gairmaujuudagi ko unki aapasi samasya ke rup main dekha gaya
 Ali said, 'it was sad for me not to be involved in the promotion of' Bobby Detective ', because Diya Mirza and Sahil Sangha are very good people and secondly because' Bobby Detective 'is the biggest break for me so far
 'ali ne kaha, 'mujhe achche se maaloom tha ki vidya baalan jaisi actress film main mukhya bhoomika main hai

 ' vaasu bhaganani kii welcome tu karachi ko lekar irfan khan ke saath unki tanatani kii khabaren aa rahi hai, lekin irfan kaa kahana he ki ve apni marji se film se alag hue hai
 This is because of their creative differences with the producers
 irfan ke kareebi sutara ne kaha he ki produsar ko pehle hi bataa diya gaya tha ki irfan is film kaa hissaa nahin ban rahe hai
 Irfan told about this, 'why should i talk about this to a producer
 main lagbhag dedh saal se screepting kii stage se hi welcome tu karachi se judaa hua hum
 When Vasuji joined the project as a producer, he wanted to start it immediately
 lekin mujhe laga ki abhi ham puri tarah taiyaar nahin hai
 i suggested that first we should plan things and we need the best actor for that
 jo karachi ke lahaze ko laa saken
 i felt that we are not ready for the climax too
 lekin unhen to shoot kii jaldi thi
 "he further explains," the producer told him, i don't care whether you do the film or not
 yah baat thi jisane mujhe project se alag hone ke liye majaboor kiya, baad main main film main chemiyo karne ke liye raji ho gaya
 i also returned the money for the shoot

 The Chief Minister Nitish Kumar became the owner of the throne of Bihar, showing the dream of making Bihar a criminal free, in the same Bihar, he got the title of being a small government, Bihar's worst criminal
 yahaan se shuru hua maamalaimandaar or sharif nitish kumaar kii party jadiu ke mokama se vidhayak anant singh ke parivaar kii kisi mahila ko baadh bazaar ke isi chowk par chaar ladakon ne ched diya
 The news reached Anant Singh
 bas phir kya tha
 a cart full of goons got out of his MLA residence in Patna
 chaaron ladakon ko bhare bazaar se uthaaya gaya
 The betel nut had died in the name of all four
 magar tabhi patna police ko isaki bhanak lag jaati he
 a special police team reaches the village of Anant Singh
 chaar main se teen ladke tab tak buree tarah pit chuke the bas unako maranaa baaki tha
 But at the last moment, the police rescue them and capture five goons of Anant Singh
 magar chauthaa ladkaa nahin miltaa
 The next day, his body is found from the village of Anant Singh
 chashmadidon kii maane to uski donon ankhen phod di gai thim
 The genitals were crushed and beaten with sticks until he died
 iske baad uski laash khet main phenk di gai
 The SSP showed that those who know Maddaanant Singh know how to hide their enemies
 magar 'anant singh ji' sarkaar ke vidhayak hai or upar se chote sarkaar bhi
 Never fear the law
 police ko sab pataa tha par 'anant singh ji' par haath koun daale? lihaaja isi kashmakash main vakt bitta jaataa he
 It seems that this time too the law will die before coming to the doorstep of 'anant Singh ji'
 magar tabhi patna ke noujvaan esaspi jitendra rana system se ladane kaa hausala dikhaate hai
 His statement is taken after the arrest of five boys
 ek likhit bayaan detaa he ki baadh bazaar main chaar ladakon ko uthaane or unhen sabak sikhaane kaa hukum kisi or ne nahin balki vidhayak 'anant singh ji' ne diya tha
 But the news of this statement against Anant Singh gets noticed by the top police officers and those in power
 lihaaja aanan-fanan main 22 june kii raat 10 baje esaspi ke tabadale kaa aadesh aa jaataa he
 And from here the battle of two SSP of Patna against the system begins
 ek patna se jane vaale esaspi or duusare patna main aane vaale nae esaspi
 In fact, two ssps of Patna played an important role in showing the law of law to Anant Singh for the first time
 ek jitendra rana jinhone apane tabadale ke baad bhi apni vardi kii takat kaa ahsaas kara diya to duusare vikaas vaibhav jinhone enie se patna waapas aakar pehle hi din apni takat or manshaa bhi saaf kar di
 At the press conference before the transfer, when Nitish Kumar signed the transfer file of Jitendra Rana on the night of 22, he would not have felt at all that the politics going on in the police department under his nose would shake his politics
 22 june kii raat das baje esaspi jitendra rana ke tabadale kaa aadesh aata he or 23 june kii dopaher tak unhen apana charge nae esaspi vikaas vaibhav ko saunp dene ko kaha jaataa he
 If Jitendra Rana wanted to leave the SSP of Patna SSP with Khamoshi, he would go to a new posting
 magar unhone ek aisa kadam uthaaya jisane bihar police or bihar kii raajnneeti main tufaan laa diya
 Despite the transfer order, he called his last press conference at 1 pm on 23 June before leaving the chair and revealed all the misdeeds of 'anant Singh Ji'
 jitendra rana kaa daanv aisa tha ki ab uthhke baad unki kursi par baithne vaale esaspi yaa bihar police ke aalaa afasaron ke liye bhi anant singh ko bachaana mushkil tha
 On the go, an SSP had stamped the arrest warrant of Anant Singh and left the warrant to the new SSP
 nae esaspi ne bolaa dhawabihar kii kismat acchhee thi
 Vikas Vaibhav, the new SSP replacing Jitendra Rana, was also full of enthusiasm
 unhone jitendra rana ke adhure kaam ko puraa karne kaa bidaa uthaaya
 The initial evidence was convincing, so as soon as he was charged, he quietly obtained a search warrant from the court to search Anant Singh's house
 or phir 24 june kii dopaher puure patna ke alag-alag jilon se force ikattha kar us anant singh ke ghar par dhaava bol diya jahaan jane kii himmat koi nahin karata tha
 The search lasted over four hours
 talaashi main ghar se wo-wo saamaan mili ki bas shaam hote-hote anant singh kii sari hekdi hi tut gai
 Much evidence had been gathered
 ab bas pardaa giraane kii baari thi
 By evening, the curtain also fell and Anant Singh was arrested
 iske baad raat ko hi unhen magistrate ke saamne pesh kiya gaya
 From where he was sent to judicial custody for 14 days in the same Beur jail where he has lived before
 2004 main STF ne bolaa tha anant ke ghar par dhavnant singh ke ghar par estf ne 2004 main dhaava bolaa tha or phir ghanto golibari hui
 Anant Singh was also shot
 magar wo batch gaya
 However, eight people of Anant Singh were killed in this encounter
 iske baad anant singh ne yahaan is kile jaise ghar main apane aap ko kaid kar liya
 After coming here, Anant Singh did the first thing that a total of 50 families were hired in this house
 jaanate hai kyon? taaki phir kabhi police yaa estf un par dhaava bole to ye parivaar unke liye dhaal kaa kaam kare
 Such a career, let's now take a look at the crime career of Anant Singh, known as Chhote Sarkar
 kanoon kii kitaab main shaayad hi koi aisi dhara bachi ho jiske tahat anant singh ke naam par mukadmaa darj na ho
 Anant Singh has more than two and a half dozen serious cases registered
 inamen katl, apharan, phiroti, dakaiti or balaatkaar jaise tamaam sangeen maamle shaamil hai
 Only 23 serious cases are registered in the flood station alone
 ye baat digar he ki anant singh apane rasookh se inamen se kai maamalon main bari ho chukaa he
 Along with the world of crime, Anant Singh also increased his penetration in the political corridors and came close to Nitish Kumar
 nitish kii dosti anant ko bahut raas ai or navbanr 2005 main wo mokama se jediu ke tikat par chunaav jeet gaya
 The Jain community is angry that the Rajasthan High Court has recently banned the 'santhara'
 santhara jain dharm main vah rivaaz he, jisamen koi bhi vyakti apni ichha se ann or jal tyaag detaa he or mrityu ko apanaataa he
 The assumption behind this is that if someone takes santhara on their own will, they attain salvation, but the Rajasthan High Court termed it a suicide and said that it is a crime punishable under Section 309
 rajasthan hoicourt ne santhara par roak laga di he, jise lekar jain samudaay ne alag-alag jagah virodh pradarshan kiye hai
 Ajay Kala, a well-known businessman from Jaipur who joined the protest in Jaipur today, said, "we are not talking about right to die
" yah har jaini kaa janmasiddh adhikaar he ki vah dharm nibhaate hue kaise apane jivan kaa nirnay karata he
 To stop this is playing with religion
 pradarshan main shaamil huin navita jain ne kaha, ham is baat se sahamat nahin hai ki court ne isse aatmahatya qaraar diya
 You commit suicide desperately and do not tell the family
 santhara main pehle aap parmishan lete hai, tabhi guru yaa muni ke maarg darshan main santhara lete hai
 The petition on Santhara was filed in 2006
 nau saal ke baad rajasthan hoicourt ne isamen apana nirnay sunaaya he
 It is obvious that the Jain community is socially and politically influential and it will be difficult for every government to implement the court order
 khaskar isliye kyonki isamen ab court ke adeshon ke mutabik, bhartiya dand sankhya ki dhara 309 lagu ho jaaegi
 Madhav Mitra, who was a lawyer against Santhara, said, "they say that this is not a suicide, but when you decide to take Santhara, then you know that your result is death, then it is a suicide and a crime against Section 309 applies
 tippaniyan Protests are already taking place regarding the ban on Santhara
 kya insaan apana jivan kisi bhi kaaran se tyaag saktaa he? Is Santhara a suicide or a surrender to life, through which the soul becomes strong and attains salvation? The dispute has not ended yet, because now a REVISION PETITION has been filed in the Supreme Court against the decision of Rajasthan High Court
 iske peeche dharna he ki agar koi apni ichha se santhara letaa he to vah moksh ko praapt karata he, lekin rajasthan hai court ne ise aatmahatya bataaya or kaha ki yahg dhara 309 ke tahat dandaneey aparaadh he
 The Rajasthan High Court has banned Santhara, for which the Jain community has protested in different places
 aaj jaipur main virodh pradarshan main shaamil hue jaipur ke jane-maane vyavsaayee ajay kaala ne kaha, ye ham rhite tu daai ki baat nahin kar rahe hai
 It is the birthright of every Jaini how he decides his life while playing religion
 is par roak lagaana dharm se khilwaad he
 Navita Jain, who joined the protest, said, "we do not agree that the court termed it a suicide
" aatmahatya to aap hataash hokar karte hai or parivaaravaalon ko nahin bataate
 In Santhara, you take permission first, only then you take Santhara in the guidance of Guru or Muni
 santhara par yachika 2006 main daayar kii gai thi
 After nine years, the Rajasthan High Court has given its decision in it
 zaahir he ki jain samudaay saamaajik or raajnneetik rup se prabhaavshaalee to he hi or court ke aadesh ko kriyanvit karnaa har sarkaar ke liye mushkil hoga
 Especially because according to the orders of the court in this, Section 309 of Indian Penalty Number will be applicable
 santhara ke khilaaf vakil rahe madhav mitra ne bataaya, inkaa kahana he ki ye suicide nahin he, lekin jab nirnay karte ho santhara lene kaa , to aapako pataa hota he ki aapkaa rigelt deth he, to yah suicide he or ek aparaadh he, jiske khilaaf dhara 309 lagu hoti he
 The comments santhara par jo roak lagi he usko lekar virodh pradarshan to ho hi rahe hai
 Can a person give up his life for any reason? kya santhara aatmahatya he yaa jivan kaa samarpan, jisase aatma majboot hokar moksh ko praapt karti he? vivaad kaa abhi ant nahin hua he, kyonki ab rajasthan hoicourt ke nirnay ke khilaaf supreme court main ek REVISION PETITION daayar ho chuki he

 kya insaan apana jivan kisi bhi kaaran se tyaag saktaa he? Is Santhara a suicide or a surrender to life, through which the soul becomes strong and attains salvation? The dispute has not ended yet, because now a REVISION PETITION has been filed in the Supreme Court against the decision of Rajasthan High Court
 santhara ke khilaaf vakil rahe madhav mitra ne bataaya, inkaa kahana he ki ye suicide nahin he, lekin jab nirnay karte ho santhara lene kaa , to aapako pataa hota he ki aapkaa rigelt deth he, to yah suicide he or ek aparaadh he, jiske khilaaf dhara 309 lagu hoti he
 The comments santhara par jo roak lagi he usko lekar virodh pradarshan to ho hi rahe hai
 Can a person give up his life for any reason? kya santhara aatmahatya he yaa jivan kaa samarpan, jisase aatma majboot hokar moksh ko praapt karti he? vivaad kaa abhi ant nahin hua he, kyonki ab rajasthan hoicourt ke nirnay ke khilaaf supreme court main ek REVISION PETITION daayar ho chuki he

 If the Congress party is describing this issue as the result of the failed foreign policy of the Modi government, then the BJP has accused the Congress itself
 rahul gandhi par hue hamale kaa jawaab jammu-kashmir ke purv mukhyamantri or neshnal conference ke netaa umr abdulla ne diya he
 Omar wrote that before questioning Rahul, BJP should look into his house
 masood ajahar ko lekar umr abdulla ne twit kiya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne china ke saamne sarender kar diya he
 At the same time, he has surrendered in front of Pakistan by not conducting elections in Jammu and Kashmir
 bijepi is kis tarah ye daawa kar sakati he ki usne aatankwaad ke khilaaf sakht niti apanaai he
 PM Modi surrendered to China on Azhar and surrendered to Pakistan & its proxies by delaying elections in J&K

 co / oovvp9cedj — Omar Abdullah (@omarabdullah) March 14, 2019 Apart from this, he also responded to Ravi Shankar Prasad
 umr ne likhaa, ‘’mantri ji aapaki sarkaar ne pakistan ko tabhi jeet kaa jashn manaane kaa mauka diya jab aapane anantnag main upachunaav nahin karaae or ab aap vidhansabha ke chunaav nahin kara rahe hai
 If anyone is giving Pakistan a chance to celebrate, it is not Rahul Gandhi
 zaraa apane ghar ko bhi dekhen
 "significantly, on Thursday morning, on the issue of China, Rahul Gandhi surrounded Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 rahul ne twit kiya tha ki piem modi ne chini raashtrapati shi jinping se darate hai, yahi kaaran he ki vah china ke khilaaf kuch bhi nahin bol rahe hai
 Before the announcement of Lok Sabha elections, there was speculation that the Lok sabha-assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir could be held simultaneously
 lekin aisa nahin hua, jiske baad se hi neshnal conference or pidipi is mudde par centre sarkaar ko gher rahi he
 Omar Abdullah has alleged that BJP is not conducting assembly elections in JK for its own benefit
 pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah aaj dilli main 15 bijepi shasit rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ke saath mishan 2019 ke liye manthan kar rahe hai
 The five states of the country played an important role in the historic victory of the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 maujuuda daur main in paanchon rajyon main bijepi kii sarkarein hai
 There are a total of 208 Lok Sabha seats in these bjp-ruled states
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main inamen se endie ko 193 siten mili thim
 BJP got 172 seats and allies 21 seats
 aise main 2019 main modi kii satta main dobaaraa se vaapasi kaa daaromadar inhen paanchon rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon par nirbhar he
 1
 uttar pradesh main yogi adityanath par bharosaanarendra modi kaa sara daaromadar uttar pradesh par tikaa hua he
 Yogi Adityanath is in power in UP
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi upi kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se 71 jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 Apart from this, 2 seats were won by Apna Dal, an ally of BJP
 is tarah se endie ko 73 siten mili thim
 Apart from this, in the 2017 assembly elections, BJP also won a historic victory and seated power
 lekin is baar sapa-basapa ke kareeb aane se bijepi kaa sameekaran bigadataa hua najar aa rahaa he
 By-elections have been held in three Lok Sabha seats since 2014
 bijepi ye teenon siten ganvaa chuki he
 In such a situation, BJP currently has 68 seats
 party ke liye 2014 jaise nattejey doharaana aasaan nahin he
 2
 madhya pradesh: shivaraj chouhan par daanvmadhya pradesh kii satta par pichley 13 saal se shivaraj singh chouhan kabiz hai
 While BJP has been in power for 15 years
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi rajya kii kul 29 loksabhaa siton main se 27 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 However, the BJP was defeated in the by-election to the subsequent ratlam-jhabua parliamentary seat
 is tarah philhal bijepi ke paas 26 siten hai
 Madhya Pradesh's name also comes in the state with the hopes of PM Modi's return in 2019
 shivaraj singh chouhan ke khilaaf jis tarah se satta virdohi lahar dikh rahi he
 The assembly elections to be held this year before the Lok Sabha will determine the political mood of the state
 lekin rajya main hue upachunaav ke nateezon ko dekhen to pichley nattejey ko doharaana bijepi ke liye ek badi chunauti he

 rajasthan: vasundhara raaje ke raaj main phir doharayega itihaas2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ko desh kii satta ke singhaasana tak pahunchane main rajasthan kii ahm bhoomika rahi he
 The state has a total of 25 Lok Sabha seats, the BJP managed to win all the 25 seats out of 25, eliminating the opposition
 haalanki baad main ajmer or alvar loksabhaa seat par hue upachunaav main bijepi ko congress ke haathon karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 In this way, BJP currently has 23 seats left
 rajasthan main vasundhara raaje mukhyamantri hai
 In such a situation, the responsibility of repeating the results in the state is also on the shoulders of Vasundhara Raje
 vasundhara raaje ke khilaaf jis tarah se satta virdohi lahar najar aa rahi he
 In such a situation, the results of the assembly elections to be held before the Lok Sabha will determine the condition and direction of 2019
 haalanki, 2014 jaise nattejey doharaana bijepi ke liye aasaan nahin he

 gujarat: rupani bijepi ki record ko barkaraar rakh paaengegujarat bijepi kaa sabase majboot durg mana jaataa he
 BJP has been in power for the last two decades
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne vipaksh kaa safaya kar diya tha or rajya kii sabhi kii sabhi 26 loksabhaa siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 bjp's hold in the state has weakened since Narendra Modi ascended the throne of Delhi
 isi kaa nateeja he ki bijepi do dashak main pehali baar pichley saal hue vidhansabha ke chunaav main 100 siton ke neeche ai he
 While the graph of Congress has increased
 gujarat kii satta par vijay rupani kabiz hai, lekin narendra modi jaisaa tevar or andaaj na hone ke chalate kai bijepi kii raah main kai mushkilen najar aa rahi he
 It is difficult to say that BJP should repeat the previous record in Rupani Raj

 Maharashtra: Narendra Modi's comeback in Fadnavis' fire test 2019 will play a key role in Daromdar
 maharashtra main kul 48 loksabhaa siten hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP managed to win 23 and its ally Shiv Sena 18 seats
 congress 2 or ensipi 4 siton par simat gai thi
 While one seat went to the Swabhiman Paksha
 haalanki bijepi ke gondia sansadeey seat se saansad ke party chhodane ke baad hue upachunaav main ensipi ne jeet hasil kii he
 In this way, BJP has only 22 seats left
 loksabhaa ke kuch maheene ke baad hue vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ne shivasena se alag hokar ladaa or sabase badi party banakar ubhari
 However, later the BJP, along with Shiv Sena, came to power in the state and Devendra Fadnavis became the Chief Minister
 lekin pichley chaar saalon main jis tarah se maratha or dalit andolan khadey hue usne bijepi kii neend haraam kar di he
 Not only this, the ways of the Shiv Sena and the BJP have also been reprimanded
 donon dal 2019 main alag-alag chunaav ladane ke sanket de chuke hai
 Whereas, Congress and NCP are talking about contesting elections together
 aise main 2014 loksabhaa chunaav jaise nattejey bijepi ke liye aasaan nahin dikh rahe hai

 22 saal pehle aaj hi ke din cinemagharon main ek film release hui thi jise sahi myanon main bharat kii sabase badi war film kaha ja saktaa he
 JP Dutta's famous film Border was based on the 1971 indo-pakistan war
 saal 2019 main bhale hi uri jaisi filmein ban rahi hon jo takanic, cinemetography or bajet ke maamle main behatar ho lekin baat agar kisi film ke saath judaav, bhaawanaaon or nostelgia kii ho to border se behatar war film milanaa mushkil he
 Perhaps this is the reason why this film was also awarded the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film for National Integration
 3 neshnal awords jeet chuki border saal 1997 kii sabase zyada kamai karne vaali film thi
 JP Dutta has made many non-war films, but he has been in the news only because of his war films and the most prominent name among them is Border
 datta kaa daawa he ki indian cinema ke itihaas main unki film ‘border’ pehali film thi jisane khule taur par pakistan ko shatru ke taur par chinhit kiya
 How much JP Dutta loves the borders can be gauged from the fact that his first film was also about the border
 us film kaa naam 'sarhad' tha
 The story of this film was about Indian prisoners of war
 isamen vinod khanna, bindiya goswami or mithun chakravarti lead role kar rahe the
 Shooting of the film started in 1976, which was completed 60% but had to be discontinued due to financial reasons
 unka bhai deepak indian air force main squadran leader tha or duty ke dauraan uski mrityu ho gai
 J
 in memory of the same pi
 Dutta had planned 'sarhad'
 khaas baat ye he ki jab datta ‘border’ banane ja rahe the, us dauraan pivi narsimha raav pradhanmantri the
 Dutta sent him an application asking him to approve the shooting and support the army
 narsimha raav ne wo arji padhi thi or uske neeche ek chota sa note likhaa tha, 'puraa sahyog diya jaae
 It is said that Narasimha Rao said, 'this film must be made
 ''border' kii release hone ke baad unki charchaa dur-dur tak fail gai thi jisase datta kii suraksha ko khatra ho gaya tha
 During that time, the police commissioner called Dutta and said that his life was in danger, so two armed men were sent to protect him, who had been under his protection for three-four months
 jepi ne is film ke nirmaan ke liye apni us diary kaa reference bhi liya tha jisamen unhone apane bhai ke airforce main bitaye gaye lamhon ko share kiya tha
 He also dedicated his film Border to his brother
 sani deol ne film main bhartiya army officer kuldeep singh chandapuri kii bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Kuldeep was honored by the Indian Army with the honor of Mahavir Chakra Sena for his valor
 is film main yun to kai sitaron ne kaam kiya tha lekin kai sitare aise bhi the jo is film kaa hissaa banane se chook gaye the
 Sanjay Dutt was to play the role of Wing Commander Andy Bajwa earlier in this film but due to his jail dispute, this role was played by Jackie Shroff
 gauratlab he ki is film main leftinent dharamvir ke role ke liye salmaan khan, aamir khan, akshay kumaar, ajay devgan or saf ali khan ko approach kiya gaya tha lekin aakhirkaar is role ko nae actor akshay khanna ne nibhaayaa tha
 Salman was not ready for this role, the same Aamir was shooting for Ishq at that time
 saf or akshay ne is film kaa hissaa banane se inkaar kiya tha vahi ajay multistarar film kaa hissaa nahin bananaa chaahate the
 Apart from this, Manisha Koirala also signed the film but she later refused to do this film
 iske alaava juhi chawla ne kuldeep singh kii patni kaa role thukraa diya tha jise baad main tabboo ne nibhaayaa tha
 Juhi did not really want to do a small role in this film
 is film ko bharat kii sabase badi waar movie isliye bhi kaha jaataa he kyonki is film ke liye kuch aise intjaam kiye gaye the jo isse pehle kabhi nahin hue the
 For example, real hawker hunters were used for the film
 inhen hathiyaaron kaa istemaal yuddh main bhi hua tha
 Many real soldiers took part in the shooting of the film and most of the weapons in the film like tanks, army jeeps and other weapons were also used in the war
 is film kii shooting main real feel dene ke liye bikaner ke banjar registan main shooting hui thi
 Even if it is said that beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, but trust the researchers, then they say that any couple loves their partner the most

 Only scored 231 runs in 5 overs
 bharat kii taraf se paanchon gendbaajon- jahir khan, ashish nehra, munaf patel, harbhajan singh or yuvaraj singh ne do-do wicket liye
 Sehwag gave India a stormy start and it seemed that the team would reach 300 runs, but losing runs at regular intervals in the middle slowed the run pace
 alam yah tha ki ek samay 15 over tak gend seemaa rekha ke paar hi nahin gai
 Sehwag again opened the account by hitting a four
 unke nishane par umr gul the, jinke khilaaf unhone 19 gend par aath chauke jamaakar pakistani akraman ko tharra diya
 In the second over of Gul, he hit an unbeaten stroke play in the stroke of five fours, but was dismissed as soon as he missed
 riyaj kii pehle over main hi middle or leg stump par pich kii gai gend unhen pagabaadha kar gai or refral bhi unke khilaaf gaya
 Tendulkar's fate supported him
 unhone apni kalaatmakataa or placement kaa acha najaara pesh kiya, lekin is bich chah baar vah pavilion jane se bache
 When Tendulkar was on 23, umpire Ian Gold lbw him on Ajmal's appeal
 gend line main thi, lekin riple se lag rahaa tha ki vah leg stump chhod rahi thi
 Gold had to change the decision
 agali gend par stamping kii apil par tendulkar ko andeh kaa phayda mila
 The master blaster was followed by Misbah for 27, Yunus Khan for 45 and Kamran Akmal for 70
 teenon avasaron par durbhaagyashaalee gendbaaj aafridi rahe
 When Tendulkar was on 81, he was caught by Omar Akmal off Mohammad Hafeez
 is bich duusare chor par lagaataar teen wicket girane se bhi tendulkar par dabaav bana
 Gambhir missed Hafeez's flight taking the ball after making some attractive shots and the rest of the work was done by the wicketkeeper, but it was Riaz who shook the Indians
 match ke 26wein over main pasa palata
 Riyaz then dismissed Virat Kohli (9) and Yuvraj on consecutive balls
 taaliyon kii gunj ke saath krij par kadam rakhane vaale yuvaraj thodi si swing leti nichi rahati phultas par bold hue
 The audience was heartbroken
 unki dhadkane bad gai thi
 Dhoni did not allow Riyaz's hat-trick, but the Indian team was under pressure and the Pakistani bowling had come to dominate
 alam yah tha ki 30wein over ke baad gend ko seemaa rekha ke darshan karne ke liye 45wein over tak kaa intjaar karnaa padaa or is bich team ne tendulkar or dhoni ke wicket ganvaae
 Dhoni also got life, but he could not take advantage of it
 riyaj kii gend par kamran ne unka kaich choda lekin isi over main bhartiya captain pagabaadha out ho gayi
 The referral also did not save Dhoni
 gul ne apane pehle chaar over main 41 ran diye the or baad main bhi unki nahin chali
 In the first over of the batting powerplay, Raina hit him with three fours
 is bich doosraa ke dhani harbhajan singh (12) ko ajmal ne doosraa par apana shikaar banaaya, jabaki riyaj ne jahir khan (9) ke rup main paanchvaan wicket liya
 In order to put pressure on Pakistan, it was necessary to take wickets and in such a situation, Yuvraj did a great job in bowling
 baayen haath kii unki spin gendbaaji is toornament main virdohi ballebaajon par kahar banakar tuuti he or mohali kii pich bhi apwaad nahin rahi
 In front of his home audience, Yuvraj first uprooted the middle stump of Asad Shafik (30), who wanted to cut the straight ball
 agle over main unhone anbhavi younus khan (13) ko lafted cover drive ke liye lalachaakar kaich karaayaa
 Umar Akmal (29) tried to spoil Yuvraj's successive overs with a six and a half to increase his pace and increase the run rate, but Dhoni has to be praised for his clever captaincy
 unhone tab harbhajan ko gend saunpi, jinaki arm ball jaisi sidhi gend par umr bold ho gaye
 If Harbhajan surprised Omar, Munaf did the same for Abdul Razzaq (3)
 unki leg kattar par rajjak cat karnaa chaahate the, lekin vah kuch samaj pate isse pehle gend of stump kii gilli uda chuki thi
 The disciplined bowling of the Indians was that the first extra run in the 37th over
 pakistan kii ummid captain shahid ofridi par tiki thi, lekin harbhajan kii phultos ko hawa main laharaakar jaise hi vah pavilion laute, bhartiya jeet aupchaarikta maatr rah gai
 As Diwali was dismissed as Misbah's final wicket, a Diwali atmosphere was created at the PCA Stadium
