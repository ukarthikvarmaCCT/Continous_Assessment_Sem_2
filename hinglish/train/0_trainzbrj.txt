 Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's sharp advice from former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the silence in Kathua and Unnao rape case, the government has come in an aggressive post and the Law Minister took the front on her behalf and attacked the former Prime Minister's remarks

 In response to Manmohan Singh's statement, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the Prime Minister has called the incidents of rape shameful and inhuman
 doctor manmohan singh kii tulana main unka najariya alag he
 Immediate action is taken when PM Modi says something
 doctor manmohan singh ko apane samay kii tulana modi ji ke samay se nahin kerani chahie
 In a conversation with the Indian Express newspaper, Manmohan Singh said that he was happy that after maintaining silence for so long, PM Modi finally said something on the occasion of Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary
 pichley hafte shuukravaar ko piem modi ne kaha tha ki 'bharat kii betiyon ko nyaay milegaa or doshiyon ko bakhsha nahin jayega
 "BJP made a joke" When Mohammad Mohan Singh was asked that the BJP used to call him 'moun Mohan Singh' while making fun of him, the former Prime Minister said, 'I have faced such comments all my life
 mujhe lagata he ki pradhanmantri (modi) jo mujhe salaah diya karte the, us par unhen khud amal karnaa chahie or aksar bolte rahanaa chahie
 i had come to know from the media that he used to criticize me for not speaking
 unhen ab khud mujhe di gai salaah par amal karnaa chahie
 Manmohan Singh said that after the 2012 gang-rape (nirbhaya incident) in Delhi, the Congress party and his government had taken necessary steps and changed the law on rape cases
 kathua or unnav rape cese main piem modi ke alaava kai anya mantriyon ne bhi lagaataar chuppi saadh rakhi thi, jis par vipaksh ne jamkar hamalaa kiya
 Rahul Gandhi has been constantly questioning Modi's silence

 Pakistan has taken the first step a month after laying the foundation stone of the Kartarpur Corridor
 pakistan sarkaar ne is coridor ke sanchaalan ko lekar donon deshon kii baithak se pehle bharat ko bhejne ke liye draft taiyaar kiya he
 India Today has exclusive information about this draft
 pakistan kii ore se taiyaar kiye gaye is draft main kaha gaya he ki galiyare kaa mukhya uddeshy kartarpur main bhartiya tirthayatriyon ke liye vija mukt yatra kii suvidha pradaan karnaa he or iske liye donon pakshon (bharat or pakistan) ko sakriy hona chahie taaki ve apane-apane kshetra main buniyadi dhaancha taiyaar kar sake
 It is also recorded in the draft that both countries will create a database of Indian pilgrims
 is database main unki maujuuda jaankaree hogi
 Also, Pakistan will allow pilgrims to reach the corridor under these conditions - 1
 samooh main kam se kam 15 tirthayatri hon
 2
 tirthayatriyon ko apane paas vaid passport or praasangik suraksha nikasi dastavej rakhana hoga
 3
 bharat ko tirthayatriyon ke sabhi vivaranon ke saath unke aane kii soochna teen din pehle deni hogi
 4
 permit sirf kartarpur kii yatra ke liye jari kiya jayega
 5
 ek din main 500 se adhik tirthayatriyon ko aane kaa permit nahin diya jayega
 6
 bhartiya tirthayatriyon ke liye galiyara subah 8 se shaam 5 baje tak khulaa rahegaa
 Pakistan has written in its draft that it reserves the right to refuse a pilgrim at any time and this agreement will be implemented according to the national laws of both countries (pakistan and India)
 pakistan ke kanoonon or niyamon kaa paalan karne vaale tirthayatriyon ke liye koi chhot nahin hogi
 However, talks between the two countries are yet to be held on this corridor, but before that Pakistan has made its stand
 agar bharat pakistan ke is draft par raji ho jaataa he to donon pakshon ke hastakshar ke baad yah samjhauta lagu ho jayega
 If not agreed then it can be amended
 haalanki
 Sources in India have said that the Kartarpur Corridor is not a political but a cultural initiative
 hamen taur-tareekon or suraksha ke mudde par kaam karnaa hoga
 It does not mean that we will start a conversation

 51 karod rupee kii laagat aayegi
 In a written reply to the question of Raghuvansh Prasad Singh in the Lok Sabha last year, the then Culture Minister Kumari Selja had admitted that during the excavation in 1958, souvenirs of Lord Buddha were found in Vaishali and the Patna High Court government has given the said relics of Lord Buddha
 He was instructed to set up a museum in Vaishali for keeping
 kendriya samskruti mantralay ne kaha tha, ‘centre sarkaar is pariyojna ke liye vittiya sahaayta pradaan karne ke liye sahamat ho gai he, basharte bihar sarkaar dwaara vistrut prastaav prastut kiya jaae
 The Center had told the Lok Sabha that according to the information received from the Government of Bihar, out of the total area required for the museum, 2 so far
 5 acre kshetra adhigrahit kiya ja sakaa he
 Raghuvansh Prasad, however, said that it is a matter of regret that the requisite land has not yet been acquired, whereas 25 to 30 acres of land is needed to build an international-level museum
 unhone kaha ki jan aakanksha or adaalat ke nirnay kaa sammaan karte hue jald se jald bhberjan kii karrwai puri kii jaae
 Raghuvansh Prasad Singh also wrote a letter to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar regarding this and urged to complete the construction work of the museum soon

 The special thing is that even after Mahakumbh, these beautiful models will be found in the Sangam city as a heritage and devotees will always be able to see them

 Five years after those elections, this time the BJP is looking to be part of the government in these two Christian-majority states of the Northeast

 Especially if it fails to repeat its 2014 performance in some of the big states when it has scored 27 out of 29 in Madhya Pradesh, all 26 in Gujarat, all 25 in Rajasthan, 71 out of 80 in Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh It won 10 out of 11 seats in Karnataka, 17 out of 28 seats in Karnataka and 22 out of 40 seats in Bihar
 satta virdohi rujhaan se party ke netaa chintit hai jo ki rajasthan or madhya pradesh main hue haal ke upachunaavon main or gujarat vidhansabha chunaavon se saamne aa chukaa he
 This is the reason why BJP President Amit Shah is trying to spread the base of the party across the country
 sarama kehete hai, ''2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main kuch rajyon main hamaara pradarshan asaadhaaran rup se behatar tha
 Maybe we can't repeat it

 "in the current Lok Sabha, both Congress and BJP have eight seats each from the Northeast

 aspataal ne kaha he ki jayalalita ke ilaaj par ames ke visheshgy or british doctor richard jon bile bhi najar rakh rahe hai
 Jayalalithaa is being given medication for breathing and diabetes
 siem ko antibiotics bhi di ja rahi he
 The people of Tamil Nadu, especially Jayalalithaa's supporters, are eagerly awaiting the return of 'amma'
 jayalalita kii kharaab sehat or sarkari kaamkaaj se unki gairmaujuudagi ko lekar tarah-tarah kii baaten ho rahi hai
 Amidst all this, the future of Tamil Nadu government is being discussed the most
 tamilnadu ke siyaasi halake main jayalalita ke uttaradhikari ko lekar charchaa tej he
 Most of these people point towards the South Indian actor Ajit Kumar
 jayalalita kii party ediemke kaa daawa he kijayalalitane apane uttaradhikari or tamilnadu ke agle mukhyamantri ke taur par ajit kumaar ko chun liya tha
 Panneerselvam will not be the successor of Amma! It is being said that this decision regarding the successor is written in Jayalalitha's will and Jayalalithaa's very good associates are well aware of this will
 isse pehle bhrashtachar maamle main jab jayalalita ko siem kii kursi chhodani padi thi to paneerselvam ko siem pad kaa prabhaar saunpa gaya tha lekin jayalalita ke uttaradhikari ke taur par paneerselvam kii sambhaavna bilkul nahin he
 Popular among AIADMK activists, Ajit 68-year-old Jayalalitha wants her successor to be someone who has the quality to attract people and has strong leadership abilities
 aise main ediemke paneerselvam ko lekar nishcint nahin he
 Actor Ajit has also shown interest in being close to Jayalalithaa
 party ke kaaryakarta bhi ajit ko kaaphi pasand karte hai
 Ajit does not have the experience of politics, but the biggest problem about Ajit is that he has no experience of politics
 aise main yakaayak unhen rajya ke mukhyamantri pad kii jimmedaari saunpna behad kathin hoga
 In this way, there is an option that Panneerselvam should take charge of the Chief Minister till Ajit Kumar takes charge of the post of CM
 is vakt jayalalita kigaiyrmaujuudagimen siem kii salaahkaar shila baalkrishnan hi shashan or prashasan se jude faisle le rahi hai or afasaron ko nirdesh de rahi hai
 AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa took oath as Tamil Nadu Chief Minister on Monday afternoon
 jayalalita ne pradesh main teesri baar mukhyamantri kii kursi sanbhali he
 Governor Surjit Singh Barnala administered the oath of office to Chief Minister to Jayalalithaa
 jayalalita ke saath 33 anya mantriyon ne bhi shapath lee
 There are 25 new faces among these ministers
 shapath grahan samaaroh main kai ganmaanya logon samet baari bheed jamaa rahi
 Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Mohan, former Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu and CPI General Secretary AB Vardhan were present at the function
 jayalalita ne aitihaasik madras vishvavidhyalay ke shatabdi sabhaagaar main pad or gopneeyata kii shapath lee
 This is Jayalalithaa's third term as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu from 1991 to 1996 and again from 2001 to 2006
 shashan sucharu rup se chale iske liye is baar jayalalita ne grah dashaon kaa khaas khyaal rakhaa
 Although on May 16, twelve o'clock in the afternoon was chosen for swearing in, but the late arrival of the Governor delayed the program
 63 varshiya jayalalita ne shapath grahan ke liye jo vakt chunaa, uske peeche jyotish kaa conection dekha ja rahaa he
 According to astrologers, it is Rahu Kaal at seven to nine in the morning and Yama Gand at ten to twelve in the afternoon
 yo donon vakt nae kaary ke liye shubh nahin maane jate hai
 Significantly, unlike Karunanidhi, Jayalalithaa has deep faith in God and astrology
 jyotishiyon ke mutabik agle teen saal jayalalita ke liye shandaar hai
 Jayalalithaa will run the government from St
 George's Fort instead of the new secretariat created under the Karunanidhi regime
 saint jorge fort ko karunanidhi ne central clasical tamil librari kaa rup de diya tha, lekin jayalalita ke jitate hi ise sachivalay kaa rup diya ja rahaa he

 The World T20 Super 10 round of matches will start from Monday
 is daur main badi timen ek-duusare se takaraaengi
 This collision of teams filled with big stars is always worth watching
 lekin jab baat world tii20 jaise bade toornament kii ho to is par kuch alag hi rang chadh jaataa he
 The five big stars of the WT20 Before the start of this World T20 Grand Prix, let us tell you about the five circles that are being watched by everyone
 har koi ye dekhnaa chahta he ki is toornament main ye kaisaa parform karte hai
 Many times, they drag their team from the mouth of defeat due to their performance, and many times the team has to bear the brunt of their failure
 to aaie aapako bataate hai is world tii20 main koun hai wo paanch dhurandhar
 1-'chasedown King' Virat Kohlikoi calls him the next Sachin Tendulkar, so for someone he is the best batsman in the world
 viraat kohli ne team india main apane padaarpan ke baad se lagaataar achche pradarshan se vipakshiyon ko bhi apni tarif karne par majaboor kar diya he
 Especially when chasing a target, like Kohli, there is a superpower
 bina team ko jitaaye yaa jeet ke ekadam kareeb pahunchaae kohli krij nahin chhodte
 He is also known for his attitude along with his game in the field
 kai baar aisa hota he ki balle ke saath hi inaki body language bhi vipakshi khilaadiyon kaa moral down karne main koi kasar nahin chhodti
 Kohli has scored four half-centuries in his last seven T20 matches
 agar inaki ye form jari rahi to ye akele dam par team india ko vishwavijeta bana sakate hai
 2- 'speed-swing' Emperor Mohammad Amirsirf At the age of 18, it is not easy for any young player to return after being banned for five years for spot fixing
 lekin mohammad aamir ne jabardast vaapasi kar dikhaa diya ki aap agar kisi cheez ke liye mehnat karen to aap use hasil kar hi lete hai
 If Aamir's success is called a mixture of talent and hard work, it is not wrong
 sirf 18 saal kii umr main senior team ke liye 14 test main 51 wicket hasil karnaa aasaan baat nahin he
 After his return, Aamir forced the people discussing the ban on himself to discuss his bowling
 aamir agar asia cap vaali apni form ko yahaan bhi kaayam rakh paae to inase paar paanaa vipakshi tiimon ke liye bada task hone vaala he
 3-'capton 'steve Versatile Smith At a young age, when Steve Smith, who captained a team like Australia, comes to the crease
 to maanon sochakar aate hai ki aaj to gendbaajon or fielderon ko thakaakar hi maanenge
 Smith's biggest feature is to change the gear of his batting according to the need of the team
 ye jab chaahate hai gendbaajon par tut padate hai or jab inkaa man karata he ye krij par khunta gaad dete hai
 Smith likes Indian bowling and Indian pitches very much
 is baar kaa world tii20 bharat main hi ho rahaa he, isliye sabhi tiimon ko is khatarnaak varsetyle ballebaaj se saavdhaan rahane kii jarurat he
 Varna Smith can reverse the match at any moment
 4-srilanka kaa 'angel', angelo maithyujasrilanka ke captain angelo maithyuj jarurat ke vakt wicket chatakaane or krij par utarkar gend ko maidan ke chaaron konon kii boundry dikhaane ke liye jane jate hai
 Matthews is tremendously dangerous with both the ball and the bat
 deth overs main wicket lenaa ho yaa lekar slog overon main 150-200 ke strike rate se ran bananaa, maithyuj donon ke master hai
 Mathews has played a lot of matches in the IPL, whose experience will definitely come in handy
 haalanki is baar srilanka kii team behad kharaab daur se guzar rahi he lekin agar maithyuj ko duusare chor par sahyog mil jaae to ye kisi bhi team ke khilaaf match jita sakate hai
 5-joseph Edward Root aka Jo 'runamshin' Rootjo Root Not taking this list will be an injustice to both Joe and the cricket lovers
 english team main ek baar ghusane ke baad root ne apni gaadi ko kamyaabi kaa wo root pakadaaya ki raste main aane vaala har speedbraker chur-chur ho gaya
 The 25-year-old batsman has played heavily in all three formats of cricket
 root kai baar england ko akele dam par jeet dilaa chuke hai
 If Root's bat is out in the World T20, then no bowling attack in the world will stop him
 root ko tii20 international kaa zyada anubhav to nahin he lekin unhone ab tak khele 14 tii20 international kii 12 pariyon main do baar noteout rahete hue 34 se zyada kii ausat or 133 se zyada ke strike rate se 345 ran banaae hai
 Buying a house may be at the top of your list of priorities, but is it right for you to buy a house or not
 
 
 ? yah faisla soch-samajhakar liye jane kii zarurat he, or usase pehle zaruri he ki insaan apni zaruuratein, apni aarthik sthiti, shahar main property kii keemten or kiraaye, in sabhi pahaluon ko acchhee tarah jaanch le
 Everyone dreams of buying a house, but for a middle class professional, buying a house to live in the city where he works is not always a profitable deal
 khaastaur par shaharon main proprati kii keemton or kiraayon ke bich ke antar ko dekhte hue kabhi-kabhaar kiraaye par rahane main zyaada samajhadaari hoti he, haalanki paaramparik taur par property khareednaa hameshaa phaayde kaa sauda mana jaataa rahaa he
 Sanjeev Bajaj, managing director of Bajaj Capital Limited, admits that while you are making a good investment by buying a house, but in the same situation, when you have the cash to pay it down and also you stay in that city for a long time Keep thinking of living
 lekin yah bhi dekhen ki shahar main kiraaye kii rakam property kii keemton kaa muqabla kar rahi hon
 But in spite of all this, sometimes it is better for you to rent a house
 
 
 khaastaur par unke liye, jo us shahar main basna nahin chaahate yaa jinka baar-baar transfar hota he
 The advantage of living on rent is that you can get a house according to your lifestyle even in your limited income, which is outside your budget
 agar ham kuch shaharon ko dekhen to unamem kiraaye par rahane or kharidne kii vajah saaf ho jaati he
 Financial Planning Portal www

 According to com, in a city like Bengaluru, where the number of employed people from all over the country is high, rents have increased by about 38 per cent in the last three years, while property prices are around 13 per cent
 
 
 aise main 15 lakh salanaa se zyaada kii tankhwaah waalon ko hi yahaan property kharidne ke bare main sochna chahie
 Similarly, in Chennai, property prices have come down in the last three years, but rents have increased by 10%
 
 
 yahaan bhi 20 lakh se zyaada kii tankhwaah vaale profeshnals ke liye makaan khareednaa behatar hoga
 Although fares have increased significantly in Delhi NCR, property prices in Delhi are second in the country
 aise main yahaan kiraaye par hi rahanaa behatar he
 Mumbai is the most expensive city both in terms of renting and buying
 lekin mahange kiraayon ke baavjood yahaan kiraaye par hi rahanaa samajhadaari he

 According to the founder and CEO of com, Nitin Grammar, it is not wise to blindly buy a house, and before that it is very important to take a full review of your city and your financial condition

 james anderson kaa ravindra jadeja ke saath kathith jhadap ko lekar uthaa vivaad buudhvaar ko ek baar phir bhadak uthaa
 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni lashed out at James Anderson, saying, "during the first Test, Anderson broke the boundary line and the behavior was not right
" 'anderson par aarope he ki unhone naatingham test match ke duusare din lunch ke samay pavilion ke andar dressing room lautate vakt jadeja ko gaali di or unhen dhakka diya
 Dhoni said before the second Test match against England starting on Thursday, 'we have never done this (abusing and pushing Jadeja)
 is sachaai ko sweekaar kariye
 'he said,' as in a press conference you can ask me tough questions
 unka jawaab dena yaa nahin dena, meraa adhikaar he lekin main aapako chhu nahin saktaa hum
 Or you can't come and touch me
 aap kisi bhi tarah se apni baat rakh sakate hai, lekin kuch chizon kaa paalan karnaa jaruri hota he or inkaa paalan kiya janaa chahie
 Dhoni said, "we talk a lot about sportsmanship and things like that and there are guidelines which are necessary to follow
 ' hamaari team main bhi kuch khilaadiyon ne pehle seemaa rekha kaa ulanghan kiya tha
 You can be aggressive, be verbose
 lekin kuch dishanirdesh tay kiye gayi hai or hamen unka paalan karnaa chahie
 'significantly, Anderson has been charged with Level Three and if the ICC Judicial Committee finds him guilty, he will not be able to play at least two of the remaining four Tests
 isisi ne abhi sunwaayee kii tithi tay nahin kii he or pehle do test maichon ke bich samay kam hone ke kaaran anderson kaa guuruuvaar ko lords main khelnaa tay he
 Dhoni was asked whether the incident was serious due to the push, he said, "we certainly believe so
" 'dhoni se jab poocha gaya ki 'kya is ghatana ke liye jadeja ko bhi doshi tehraaya janaa chahie
 "they said," No, i don't believe so
 ' unhone kaha, 'jadeja ne yah acha kiya ki apni taraf se koi pratikriya nahin kii
 'it could have increased a lot but i think he handled it very well
 hamen isse sikh lekar aage badhanaa hoga
 After all, we are playing the game and many people watch us and we have a lot of responsibility
 'bhartiya captain ne is baat kaa khandan kiya ki anderson ko vishesh rup se nishaanaa banaaya gaya he
 The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) stands in support of its player and it seems that the relationship between the two teams will be seen in the remaining Test matches and ODI series
 dhoni ne kaha ki vah is pahalu ko lekar bahut adhik chintit nahin hai
 He said, 'I am not worried about it
 nishchit taur main yah sunishchit karne kii koshish karuunga ki baaki shrinkhalaa sahi bhaavana se kheli jaae, lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin ki aap puri tarah se vinamr ban jaao or jhuke raho
 We want the player to be aggressive, say a few things but the important thing is not to violate boundaries
 'is bich guuruuvaar ke match ke bare main dhoni ne kaha, 'ham lords main khel rahe hai or ham sabhi is maidan ke mahatv ko jaanate hai
 Dhoni refused to explain the team combination as usual
 unhone kaha, 'maine wicket nahin dekha he
 Will have to see how tough it is and how much grass is in it
 kaaphi kuch mausam par bhi nirbhar karata he

 boxing de test match ke bare main ham sabane suna he, lekin iske itihaas ke bare main kam hi log jaanate hai
 Actually this tradition started from the year 1950, and since then Australia every year from December 26 onwards plays a Test match at Melbourne Cricket Ground
 boxing de, christmas ke baad kaa din hota he, or duniyabar main yah isaayiyon ke liye chuttee or jashn kaa din hota he
 What could be better entertainment for a cricket enthusiast than a test match
 puure paanch din cricket kaa mazaa, chathe din saal ko aakhri salaam or saatven din nae saal kaa swaagat - saat din kaa ek shandaar holiday package
 
 
 Before the tradition of the Boxing Day Test match began, a match was played in Australia's domestic tournament Sheffield Shield in Melbourne on 26 December, often between Victoria and New South Wales, which was extremely popular
 haalanki new southwells ke khilaadi is baat se naaraaz bhi rahete the ki ve match ke kaaran apane parivaar ke saath christmas nahin manaa pate the
 The first Boxing Day Test match was played in Melbourne in 1950
 haalanki tab eshez series kaa vah test match 22 disambar ko shuru ho gaya tha
 24 and 25 were a day of rest, and Boxing Day took place on the third day of the match
 varsh 1953 or 1967 ke bich melbern main boxing de test match nahin khelaa gaya
 The modern Boxing Day Test tradition began from 1974–75
 varsh 1980 main melbern cricket ground ne boxing de test kaa adhikaar hasil kar liya
 This tradition broke in 1989, when a one-day match was played between Australia and Sri Lanka on this day
 boxing de test se kai rochak ghatnaayen bhi judi hui hai
 In 1995, umpire Darrell Hair declared Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan as 'chakkar'
 hair ne teen over main unhen saat baar 'no ball' qaraar diya
 Shane Warne took a hat-trick in the Boxing Day Test against England in 1994, and in 2006 he also completed his 700 Test wickets in the Boxing Day Test, and made the last match at his home ground memorable
 varsh 1999 main sachin tendulkar ne 166 ranon kii shandaar pari kheli thi
 The master blaster had scored 52 runs in the second innings, but the Australian team managed to win the match
 har chaar saal main boxing de test aishez series kaa hissaa hota he, yani mehmaan team kangaaroon kii paramparaagat pratidwandvi england kii team hoti he, or is baar boxing de test kii mehmaan team bharat he
 By the way, now Boxing Day Test is being played at Kingsmead Stadium in Durban, South Africa

 co / epmqhsqdix uttar korea ne shanivaar ko america ko chetavanee dete hue kaha ki vah kshetra main uksaave vaali karravaayiyon se baj aae, nahin to vah parmaanu hamale ke liye taiyaar he
 North Korea gave this warning on the occasion of the 105th anniversary of its founding President Kim Il Sung
 sung, uttar korea ke vartmaan netaa kim jong un ke dada the
 North Korean dictator Kim Jong arrived in a Western-style suit in this huge military parade organized on the occasion
 jab wo aayojan sthal par pahunche to vahaan khadey sipaahiyon ne unhen salaami di or chillaakar bole, 'long liv’
 In an atmosphere of tension, North Korea has used its submarine-launched ballistic missiles (slbms) exclusively for the first time in the parade, using the parade as an opportunity to show its strength, indicating improved technical capability Get
 vahilmericandhikariyon ko is baat kaa dar he ki taanashaah is maukey par apane chathe parmaanu hathiyaar kaa pareekshan kar sakate hai
 On the other hand, North Korea's number two official has said that the country is ready to respond to any kind of nuclear attack by the US
 bhavy sainya parade kii shuruuaat se pehle ek samaaroh main cho rayong-he ne kaha ki ham aar-paar kii ladaai ke liye taiyaar hai or ham apane tareeke se kisi bhi parmaanu hamale kaa jawaab dene ko taiyaar hai
 Pyongyang is facing several UN sanctions due to nuclear and ballistic missile programs
 isaki mahatvakanksha ek aisa rocket banane kii he, jo america mukhya bhubhag tak aayudh pahunchane main sakasham ho
 US President Donald Trump has vowed that this will not happen
 uttar korea ne abhi tak paanch parmaanu pareekshan kiye hai
 Two of these tests were performed last year
 parmaanu pareekshan ke saath hi is desh ne kai missile bhi prakshepit kiye hai
 Last month, three rockets fell into the waters near Japan
 aisi atakalein hai ki uttar korea aane vaale dinon main apana chhathvaan parmaanu pareekshan kar saktaa he
 White House officials say that military options are being assessed to deal with Pyongyang
 america raashtrapati trump ne vimaan vaahak uassoes karl vinson or saath main ek yudhak samooh ko korian prayadweep bhej diya he
 "we are sending a naval fleet, which is very powerful," Trump told Fox Business Network

 At the same time, China's foreign minister Wang Yi, the only major ally of North Korea, warned that conflict could start at any moment
 china or rus donon ne hi sanyam kii apil kii he
 Shahrukh Khan likes to call himself the king of Bollywood
 unke is daawey par kai matbhed ho sakate hai, magar ye to tay he ki vah controvarsi king hai
 And one of the coincidences is that before the release of each of his films, sometimes the controversy starts with regard to the film, sometimes about his personal life
 agast main 'chennai express' aa rahi he or media main aa rahi khabaron ke mutabik shahrukh sarogesi ke jariye paidaa ho rahe bachche ke sex ditormination ko lekar vivaadon main hai
 This has happened before also
 dekhie kab hua kya vivaad
 
 
 The Chennai Express 2013, which is going to be released on Eid day i
e
 8 August 2013, was first discussed with its first poster
 isamen tamilnadu kii paramparaagat dress lungi or kameez main shahrukh or deepika najar aa rahe the
 But the poster was pulled on social sites for its background
 isamen khub saare log khadey the, jinaki twachaa kaa rang kaala tha or tond nikali hui thi
 It was seen as an attempt to present Tamil people in a stereotyped manner
 film abhi post production kii stage main he or shahrukh ek baar phir vivaadon main hai
 There have been reports in the media that Shahrukh is going to be a father again and this child is being born through surrogacy
 vivaad tab hua, jab kaha gaya ki paidaa hona vaala baccha betaa he
 People raised questions about how Shah Rukh came to know about the sex of the unborn child
 jab tak he jaan 2012yash chopra ke diarection vaali yah aakhri film thi, jo unki maut ke baad relies ho rahi thi
 Ajay Devgan's film 'son of Sardar' was also coming on the day of its release
 magar devgan ko laga ki yashraj binar dhauns ke jariye zyada se zyada theatre book karne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 He wrote to the Competition Commission of India two weeks before release and complained to Yash Raj Films
 aarope lagaaya gaya ki yashraj binar ne single screen theatre ko ye laalach diya he ki agar ve 'jab tak he jaan dikhaaenge', to unhen dikhaane ko iske baad relies ho rahi charchit film 'ek tha tiger' bhi mil jaaegi
 The commission dismissed Devgan's complaint
 don-2 2011film kii relies se ek maheenaa pehle original don ke produsar binar ne legal notice bhej diya is sikval ke nirmaataaon ko
 He said that we had only given the rights to the remake of Don
 don 2 ke produsar kaa kahana tha ki jab asal film kii sikval bani hi nahin, to uske rhite maangane kaa kya matlab
 But the real mess came from the central government
 health ministry ne notification bhej kar kaha ki film kaa lead kairactor cigarette-daaru bahut pi rahaa he
 This will encourage people towards these evils
 to yaa to aise saare seen hataae jaaen
 Or blur them
 iske baad film ke nirmaataa mantri ambika soni se mili, apana point samajhaayaa or maamla is par nipta kii film kii shuruyaat main ek vaidhanik chetavanee di jaae
 Ra One 2011 first came to the fore about a lot of foreign and plot theft from a Tamil film
 tamil main ek science fiction film ai thi 'anthiran'
 The film 'ra One' was accused of blowing his concept
 isamen kai angreji filmon masalan 'termineter 2', 'jajment de', 'da betman siries', 'aayran main' or 'tron ligesi' kii nakal thi
 Khan apparently denied the allegations and said that this is the first such film in which the superhero lives between a family
 relies ke teen din baad film phir charchaa main ai
 The site of the film was hacked by hackers from Pakistan
 unhone kaha ki hamane karachi press club kii site hack kiye jane ke khilaaf ye karrwai kii
 But the film's most serious controversy was about the theft of its story
 screen riter yash patnayak ne daawa kiya ki 'raa van' kaa concept vaisaa hi he, jaisaa unhone barason par develop kiya tha
 He went to the Mumbai High Court and said that he either got the credit or a 10 per cent share in the film's profit
 court ne film produsar ko 1 karod kii guarantee jamaa karne ko kaha
 My Name Is Khan 2009: On 14 August 2009, Shah Rukh arrived in the US for the promotion of his film My Name is Khan
 kaha jaataa he ki jab shahrukh kaa sarnem yani khan computer screen par pop ap hua, to new jersey ke suraksha adhikari unhen poochtacha ke liye duusare kamare main le gaye
 He was questioned for two hours
 ye maamla itnaa ulajhaa ki bharat main america ke rajdoot timothy romer ko safai deni padi
 Shahrukh was questioned again in another room, full of people from South Asia
 unamem se kai autograph maangane aa gaye, magar adhikari apane process par ade rahe
 On the other hand, Shiv Sena also got angry with Shahrukh before the film's release
 shahrukh ne ipel main kolkata kii team kharidi thi or vah is baat se naaraaz the ki pakistani khilaadiyon ko lig main kyon nahin khilne diya ja rahaa
 On this, Shiv Sena called Shahrukh good and bad, asked to apologize, or else threatened the film not to be performed in Mumbai
 loksabhaa adhyaksh sumitra mahajan ne aaj iskar sanshodhan vidheyak ko hangaame ke bich bina charchaa ke paarit karaae jane kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki is vidheyak ko tatkaal paarit karnaa bahut aavashyak tha
 The Lok Sabha Speaker told reporters in the Parliament House complex that this is an important bill so there should have been discussion and opposition members could express their opinion and raise their issues during the discussion
 unhone kaha, ‘‘agar charchaa hoti to bahut acha hota
 This was a very important bill
 sabhi is baat se sahamat honge ki charchaa jaruri hoti he
 The issue that the opposition wanted to raise could have been raised in the discussion
 maine baar-baar iske liye aagrah kiya
 The bill should not have been passed without discussion but it was necessary to pass it immediately
 ’’ yah puche jane par ki loksabhaa main jari gatirodh aagaamee dinon main samaapt hoga, to unhone kaha ki sabhi iske liye koshish kar rahe hai
 The comments loksabhaa adhyaksh ne kaha, ‘‘gatirodh samaapt hona chahie

 In this way, PM Modi's picture will disappear from the petrol pump of the whole country

 These (BJP leaders) write a letter for that too, people of Bharatiya Janata Party are not able to write, then i should write? It is not right to protest only for protest

 Hindus are at the forefront of those who want to change religion in Gujarat
 rajya sarkaar ko dharmantaran ke liye mili aavedan kii sankhya se is baat kaa pataa chalaa he
 About 94 per cent of such applications received in the last five years are from those who believe in Hinduism
 rajya sarkaar ko paanch saalon main sabhi dharmon ke logon se mili kul 1,838 aavednon main 1,735 aavedan hindu dharm ko maanane waalon ke hai
 Under the Gujarat Religion Freedom Act, people who want to change their religion first have to get permission from the district administration
 haalanki, rajya sarkaar ne abhi aadhe se zyada aavednon ko paas nahin kiya he
 Only 878 people have been approved for conversion
 duusare dharm ke logon ne bhi kiya he aavedanbeete paanch saalon main 1,735 hinduon ke alaava57 muslim, 42 isai or 4 parsiyon ne bhi dharm badalane ke liye aavedan diya he
 In these years no one from Sikhs and Buddhists applied to change religion
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki iske peeche manapsand shaadi ek badi vajah he
 Some applicants want to change religion so that they can adopt their spouse's religion
 kahaan-kahaan se aae aavedansarkaar ko rajya memhindu aabaadike anupaat se kahin zyada aavedan mili hai
 Most applications have come from Surat, Rajkot, Porbandar, Ahmedabad, Jamnagar and Junagadh districts
 do saal pehle junagarh main aisa ek maamla saamne aayaa tha
 There were about one lakh Dalit people who had initiated Buddhism
 sabhi aavednon ko nahin milegi manzoorijankaron ke mutabik sarkaar saare aavednon ko apane record main shaamil nahin karegi
 Jayant Mankarnia, president of the Gujarat Dalit Organization, said that if the number of Hindus applying for conversion to government figures is 1,735, then it is certain that the government will not approve all applications
 meraa daawa he ki agar sahi aankade jari kiye jaaen to aavedan karne vaale hinduon kii sankhya kareeb 50 hajaar he
 'that is why the applications are stuck
 Mankania said that we collect the applications for converting religion and send it to the concerned district administration for approval
 hamaare kaaryakarta zyaadaatar ise follow nahin karte
 In such a case, the applications are stuck in the government office
 asantosh kii vajah se badalte hai dharmaindian council of soshal science research ke purv neshnal phelo ghanashyam shah ne kaha ki sawaal ye he ki hinduon main wo koun hai, jo dharm badalanaa chaahate hai? meraa maananaa he kidaliton memmsantosh kii bhaavana he, jisaki vajah se ve dharm parivartan karana chaahate hai
 It is clear from the population figures that some people who call themselves Hindus were actually new Buddhists converted
 'vihip ne jataai naarazgivishwa hindu parishad ke mahasachivarnachhodbharwar ne is bare main bataaya ki dharm parivartan kii prakriya desh virdohi kaam he
 Some people convert Hindus by instigating or under pressure
 junagarh main buddha dharm ke prachaarkon ne hinduon ke saath aisa kiya tha
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the other end of the world is expected not only to have a strong presence on the global stage, but also to start a new chapter in the relationship with the world's only superpower
 aakhir, badi sanjidagi se yatra kaa vakt sanyukt raashtra sangh aam sabha kii baithak ke maukey par tay kiya gaya he
 It is also expected to break the deadlock of the old days and the last nine years of not giving visa
 is lihaaj se yah yatra jitani rajnatik he utani hi nijee bhi he, or yah paanch dinon ke dauraan america main modi ke mahatvakankshi agenda se bhi saaf he
 The journey of relationships is not easy but all is not so easy
 khaskar isliye ki pichley saal america-bharat ke rishte rasaatal main chale gaye the jisaki bhaddi parinti neuyork main bhartiya rajanyik devayani khobragade kii giraftaar se upje tanaav main hui
 However, diplomats and experts believe that since the relationship has been restored since then, hope is sufficient
 isaki shuruyaat loksabhaa chunaav ke parinaamon se hui jab modi or endie ko spasht bahumat hasil ho gaya
 And as Indian Foreign Ministry officials have become used to saying this again and again, due to the manner in which Modi did not express a bit of rancor on the issue of not granting himself a visa after coming to power The backdrop of the relationship between the two countries was set
 uske baad kootnithik gatividhiyaan itani teji se sakriy hoti dekhi gayi, jo durlabh hi kahi jaaegi
 US Secretary of State, Commerce Minister and Deputy Minister of Energy came together in August to participate in the fifth indo-us strategic dialogue
 kootnithik pratikon ke hisaab se dekhen to sanyukt raashtra kii aam sabha ke dauraan america main tamaam rashtradhyaksh maujuud rahenge, lekin akele modi hi hai jinhen white house main aane kaa nyotaa bheja gaya he
 However, behind these closed doors, when Modi will face solid leaders and ceos behind his doors, the talk will be straightforward
 yah baatcheet khaskar donon deshon ke bich vyapaar or kaarobaari rishton par kendrit rahegi jo ki modi ke daure ke mul main bhi he
 Ups and downs a former senior Indian diplomat posted in Washington says, "india may have been slow on the issue of reforms, but at first its reputation has been to fulfill its commitments at any cost
" pichley kuch varshon main haalanki pehali baar aisa hua ki yah taana-bana tuutane laga or nakaaratmak vaataavaran ban gaya
 Because of this, the American corporate world, which was a strong party in mutual relations, turned against India
 ”purv rajanyik kaa ishaara un silsilewar ghatnaon kii ore he jinke chalate 2005 se 2008 ke bich atomi qaraar kii vajah se bulandi par pahunche bharat-america sambandh baad main patari se utar gaye or 2010 main obama ke bharat daure ke baad hi inamen kuch sudhaar aayaa
 For example, the US companies could not do business here despite the Atomic Agreement due to the Atomic Accountability Act, a 20 billion euro medium multi-role fighter aircraft deal moved to France, a slowdown in the Indian economy, rising unemployment in the US and Delhi government fell prey to policy paralysis due to revelations of scams one after another

 The US used to be India's largest trading partner in 1998–99 when it accounted for 14 per cent of the total trade
 uske baad se giravat chaalu hui
 This share gradually fell to less than 8 per cent between 2009 and 2013 and it improved back to 8 per cent only during 2013-14

 Rahul Bhasin, managing director of Bering Private Equity, says, "the steep decline in investment came because India did not show credible and respectful behavior towards investors
" niveshkon ke dimag main ve ghatnaayen ab bhi taaja hai ki kaise britain kii badi company vodaphone par mukadmaa chalaa or supreme court ke uske paksh main faisle ke baad kar kanoonon main pichhali tarikhon se sanshodhan kar diya gaya, or nokia par kar kii daavedaari thok di gai, jo hamaare yahaan sabase bade bahurashtriya utpaadakon main ek he
 "meetings will be important
 Like India or Japan, one cannot expect immediate investment or major contract promises and results here because the US administration has nothing to do with corporate decisions
" tokyo or beijing kii sarkarein to apane udyogpatiyon ko sarkari madad ke sahare prabhavit kar leti hai
 Officials of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs say that this is why Modi is meeting with the American business community through morning breakfasts, private calls and mass receptions as investment decisions are taken not in political corridors but in corporate boardrooms Huh

 As India continues to modernize its military and fill the imperfections that have been exposed during the UPA government in previous years, this relationship will gain a greater height
 donon desh 2012 main hi praudyogiki hastantaran tathaa hathiyaaron ke sanyukt utpaadan va vikaas ke liye dephence technology and trade inishiative (dititii) par raji ho gaye the, lekin is kadam ko modi kii yatra se protsaahan milegaa
 This is perfectly suited to his 'make in India' campaign and his plan to manufacture weapons domestically
 donon deshon ke bich zyada se zyada gatividhiyaan sadbhavnapurna or moolyawaan ho sakati hai, lekin inase hi apane aap main ranneetik sambandh pragadh nahin ho jaaenge, jaisaa ki donon deshon kii dili chahat he

 It would be better if President Obama and Prime Minister Modi spend their time discussing why they need to forge a strategic partnership and how they can do it while on various issues of national competence, worldview and international politics between the US and India
 There are many differences in terms of commitment to practical cooperation

 Now just like Vodafone, Airtel has also reduced the data by 1GB in this plan
 yani graahakon ko zyada paise dekar bhi kam data milegaa
 As a reminder, Airtel used to offer 2GB 2G / 3G / 4G data and 300 SMS for 28 / 14 days with unlimited calling in the Rs 119 plan from Airtel
 lekin ab se is plan main 28 / 14 dinon kii validity ke saath 1GB data hi milegaa
 Recently Vodafone also launched its Rs 119 prepaid plan, in which 1GB data is being given with 28 days validity
 telecomtok kii report ke mutabik, airtel kii ore se is plan ko graahakon ko tak do tarah se pahunchaaya ja rahaa he
 Unlimited calling, 300 smse and 1GB 4G / 3G / 2G data are being given in one plan
 isamen graahakon ko 28 dinon kii validity di ja rahi he
 At the same time, some users are being given 300 SMS with 1GB 4G / 3G / 2G data, unlimited, local, STD and roaming calls in this plan
 lekin isaki validity 14 dinon kii he
 That is, the open market plan is only 14 days and some users are being given 28 days validity in this plan

 Jio offers unlimited calling, 2GB 4G data and 300 SMS in its Rs 98 plan and its validity is 28 days

 The year of 2017 will be seen as a year of great change in the political career of Rahul Gandhi
 desh ne unka nayaa avatar dekha—jo lagaataar jan abhiyaan chalaata he, aage badhkar sakriy rahata he, soshal media par asardaar he or purajor dhang se faisle karata he
 By the end of the year, he also took over the throne of the Congress president, which was decided but he himself had been avoiding it for years
 magar yah naatakeey badlaav ek naakaam prayog ke saath shuru hua tha
 In the run-up to the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, Rahul appointed Prashant Kishore as his party's campaign strategist
 kishor parade ke peeche 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke or 2015 ke bihar vidhansabha ke chunaav main nitish kumaar ke ranneetikaar rah chuke the
 Many Congressmen ridiculed Rahul's decision to hire Kishore as a copycat
 magar rahul ne is par dhyaan nahin diya or kishor ko chunaav abhiyaan chalaane ke liye khuli chhot dene kaa bharosa diya
 The aim of Kishore, a professional strategist, was to ensure the victory of the Congress
 ve priyanka gandhi ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar banane sareekhee buniyadi sujh lekar aae
 He ruthlessly analyzed the party's weaknesses — the organization is absolutely battered, the social media unit is not even in the bjp's position, and most consider the Congress' stance on Hindu secularism as a means of Muslim appeasement
 uttar pradesh main congress kii haar ke saath kishor kaa sang-saath to ek jatke main tut gaya, par rahul ne sabak jarur sikh liye
 Says a Congress general secretary, "with Kishore, Rahul understood how Modi was known for how he made that impression about himself
" unhen ahsaas hua ki modi kaa muqabla karne kaa sabase acha tarika yah he ki unhen unke hi khel main maat di jaae
 Within two months of the Uttar Pradesh debacle, Rahul made his favorite Lok Sabha MP, Divya Spandana, the chairman of the party's social media unit
 khud unhone twitor par apane ehtiyaat baratane vaale nazariye ko tilanjali de di or ek ke baad ek aise twit daagne lage jo modi sarkaar par hamale karte hue mazaakia or gahari sooyeeboojh se bhare the
 "we had to persuade him too much to come on Twitter, but now he is enjoying it and he writes his tweets himself," says a member of Rahul's office
 '' ve yah bhi kehete hai, ''jab kuch media channelon ne gujarat chunaavon ke baad film dekhne ke liye unki aalochana kii, to unhone bahut umdaa twit kiya, ''agar bijepi ke paas film kii frenchiji hoti to uskaa naam laai hard hota
 The biggest lesson Rahul learned from Uttar Pradesh was the power of polarization and how the BJP managed to mobilize Hindu votes
 congress ke ek rajyasabha sadsy kehete hai, shshve dharmanirpekshata main ab bhi bharosa karte hai, par jarurat logon ko yah samajhane kii he ki bhaajapa koi akeli hinduon kii rakhwali party nahin he
 "therefore, even at the cost of Muslim vote bank loss, the Congress President went to 27 temples during the Gujarat election campaign and did not make any effort to go to the mosques
 or yah dikhaane ke liye ki yah chunavi pintara bhar nahin tha, ve chunaavon ke baad somnath mandir main phir gaye
 Religion is no longer a private affair for Rahul, who describes himself as a devotee of Shiva in an electoral atmosphere heavily divided
 yah vyaavhaarik najariya rahul kii siyasat kaa nayaa pahalu he
 Till now, his politics had been called by his own party as 'NGO type'
 yah vyaavhaarik najariya hi unhen sitambar main america vishvavidhyalay le gaya tha, jo unki nai siyaasi shakhsiyat kaa launch pad bana
 The purpose of that trip, however, was to reach out to Indians living abroad for donations
 haryana ke ek bade netaa kehete hai, ''congress amir netaaon kii garib party he
 Some former chief ministers and central ministers of the party can spend the entire Lok Sabha election
 par agar aap hamaare khajaane ko dekhen to hamaare paas apane ummidavaaron ke chunaav kaa buniyadi kharchaa uthaane tak kii rakam bhi nahin he
 "the trip to Dubai in January 2018 has been postponed for the time being, which was set for the purpose of raising more money
" janadharna prabandhan se party ko gujarat chunaavon main 'naitik jeet' or soshal media par badhat bhale hasil ho gai ho, par rahul jaanate hai ki bhaajapa ke khilaaf ladaai party ke sanghathan or khajaane ko majboot kiye bagaiyr nahin jiti ja sakati
 The year of 2017 was the beginning of this journey

 The sun is now playing in most places in North India, the sky is blue
 The temperature has started climbing
 lekin in sabake baavjood amritsar se lekar kolkata tak kahin naa kahin koharaa apana kahar dikhaa hi jaataa he
 This time the railway system has been badly affected due to fog
 kohre kaa rail gadiyon par itnaa bura asar padaa he ki abhi tak railway kii takreeban 30 fisadi trainen deree se chal rahi hai
 The situation can be gauged from the fact that this time due to fog, the Railways have to cancel about 3500 trains
 in sabake bich jagah-jagah rail patariyon kii todphod kii ghatnaon ke saamne aane ke baad railway ke staff ko satarkta baratane ke nirdesh die gaye hai
 Due to this, trains are being run at less than the train speed in many rail sections
 isse railway kii samaysima bhi buree tarah se prabhavit hui he
 Actually, this time the weather took such a turn that the fog came in only in November
 uske baad disambar main takreeban 20 dinon tak ghaney kohre kii vajah se rail yatayaat buree tareeke se prabhavit hua
 By January, fog was in full swing and its impact was seen in many areas of North India
 uttar bharat or purvi bharat main ghaney kohre kii vajah se lambii duuri kii kai trainen 24 se lekar 36 ghante tak let raheen
 No trains coming towards North India arrived on time
 lekin is sthiti main abhi bhi sudhaar nahin hua he
 According to a top official of the Railway Board, this time it was decided for the first time that the tradition of canceling trains simultaneously from December to February would not be continued
 jarurat padane par hi trainon ko radd kiya jayega
 But the early fog destroyed the entire plan of the Railway Ministry
 november main pade kohre kii vajah se disambar madhya main railway ko saikadon kii taadaad main trainon ko ekasaath radd karne kii ghoshnaa kerani padi
 By the second week of February, the Railways have to cancel around 3500 trains this time
 kohre ke chalate ab bhi trainon kii letlatifi jari he
 Talking about the capital Delhi, despite the sunshine here, there were 23 trains on Saturday, which were running more than 2 hours late
 13 trainon ko rishedul karnaa padaa he
 This situation is when there is no report of dense fog from Punjab to West Bengal
 railway ke adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki kohre ko lekar hameshaa hi anischitata bani rahati he
 Last year, the Railways had already announced the cancellation of trains to save passengers from last minute problems
 lekin mausam to mausam hi he pichley saal koharaa kaaphi kam padhaa lihaaja khud hi railway ko apni radd trainon ko chalaanaa padaa
 Taking lessons from past experience, the Railways decided to cancel the vehicles as per the requirement, this time out of the box
 lekin kohre ne sari yojana par pani pher diya
 The record of the entire railway system has deteriorated due to the fog which started in November
 haalat yah he ki farvari main sirf 65 fisadi trainen hi sahi vakt par chal paa rahi hai
 While on one hand the fog severely affected the railway traffic, on the other hand the entire staff of the railway has been alerted due to repeated incidents from December to February and subsequent unsuccessful attempts to break the railway track
 aisa kaha ja rahaa he he ki railway ke field staff ko tamaam train root par gadiyon ko tay raftaar se kam raftaar par chalaae jane ke maukhik nirdesh die gaye hai jisase kisi bhi sthiti se nipta ja sake
 In such a situation, the movement of trains across the country has been badly affected and the railways have increased on many rail routes

 Discussion on the issue of reforming our bureaucracy does not reach any conclusion, because this discussion rests on the simplest assumptions
 vidambnaa yah ki charchaa main zyaadaatar dhyaan ati lalaphitaashahee par diya jaataa he, jisamen bhrashtachar mukhya mudda hota he, lekin kaaryakshmata ke mudde par zyada dhyaan nahin diya jaataa
 And an illusion is that reforms mean making some new rules, more vigilance, new institutional designs and incentives instead of work
 lekin yah is kahani kaa sirf ek chota-sa hissaa he
 In this, it is ignored that more monitoring reduces the efficiency of the system
 is tarah kii dharna main is baat ko bhi bhula diya jaataa he ki kis tarah naukarshahi kaa aacharan saamaajik-aarthik sanrachana main antarnihit he
 First, the relationship between development and bureaucratic reform is quite complex
 yah koi sanyog nahin he ki bharat se upar sthaan rakhane vaale sabhi deshon kii prati vyakti jidipi (gros domestic product-sakal gharelu utpaada) bhi upar he
 What does this tell us, where the shortage is living
 hamen donon hi tareeke se sochane kii jarurat he
 Contrary to popular belief, India does not spend enough on its state
 kshamta ke kisi bhi maandand par or kisi bhi antarrashtriya tulana main bharat kaa apane rajya dhaanche par kiya jane vaala kharch bahut kam he
 From department to department, judiciary to statisticians, food inspectors to city planners, the capacity of everyone is very less
 aam taur par sabhi kanoonon ke saath kharch kaa ek vittiya akalan bhi judaa hota he
 But we never even question the administrative consequences of imposing new responsibilities
 ham bhale hi zyaadaatar vibhaagon main karmchaariyon kii sankhya jarurat se zyada hone kaa khub ronaa rote hai, lekin vaastaviktaa yah he ki bhartiya rajya main karmchaariyon kii kami he, usamen sadhano kii kami he or paryaapt prashikshan kaa abhaav he
 This irony is best illustrated in the famous novel Raag Darbari
 kabhi-kabhi to kaam kaa boj itnaa zyada hota he ki saare kaam hi thap ho jate hai
 Development creates some resources on which the state can spend to build its capacity
 doosraa, bhrashtachar or naukarshahi ke bich kaa sambandh bhi kaaphi jatil he
 For example, the problem of Bihar and Orissa is not that there is more corruption than Tamil Nadu or Andhra Pradesh, but the fact is that poor states have less opportunities to be wisely corrupt
 zyaadaatar bhrashtachar un yojanaon se judaa hota he, jo garibon ke liye banaai jaati hai jabaki haryana yaa tamilnadu jaise rajyon main yahi paisa achal sampatti ke kshetra, doorsanchaar, sadak, yaa nai shabdaawalee sarkari-nijee saajhedaari se ugaah liya jaataa he
 In short, corruption in these states is associated with such areas, which are less affecting the poor
 duusare pahalu se sochen to yah raajnneetikon ko vikaas karne ke liye protsaahan detaa he
 There is a huge difference in the functioning of states and their bureaucracy
 isaki badi vajah he raajnneetikon ko milane vaala laabh
 Third, a real problem with the Indian state is its social location in three different paths
 saaf kahen to satta kii shakti tak pahunch ko saamaajik lamabandi ke saadhan ke rup main dekha jaataa he or is tarah yah satta ke har tarah ke istemaal ko vidhisammat bana detaa he
 Secondly, the power of power increases greatly in the hierarchical society here, because it gives you an opportunity to be more powerful than the other
 jab aap satta kii takat kaa istemaal karte hue kisi vyakti ke liye kuch karte hai to aapako ek aantarik sukh miltaa he
 But you do not get the feeling that if you are giving something to someone, then you are also taking something
 teesri baat, rajya ke bheetar saamaajik padanukram ek vyakti ko duusare se chota yaa bada banaata he
 Where in the world is there, where old customs like the caste are going on, who can sit on a chair in whose presence
 aap yah kaise ummid kar sakate hai ki nichle str kaa adhikari dusron ke saath barabari kaa aacharan kare, jab usne khud hi iskaa anubhav na kiya ho
 When has this happened when a lower level officer has been given the authority to take decisions himself
 phir yah koi tajjub kii baat nahin ki use niyamon kii jaankaree to hoti he, lekin rajya ke lakshyon kaa use koi ilm nahin hota
 Full attention is paid to the preparation of IAS, but there is absolutely no focus on giving recognition to lower level officers as professionals
 america ke bhrashtachar virdohi upayon par ek umdaa adhyayan, di parasyute of ebsalut integrity, bataata he ki achche niyamon or protsaahan kii apeksha peshewar hone kaa bhav utpaadakta or eemaandaaree laane main kahin zyada prabhavakaari hota he
 a social revolution is needed to improve the bureaucracy of the state
 naukarshahi ke saath samasya, khaskar iees ke maamle main, vichaaron kii kami kii nahin he
 An easy suggestion for bureaucratic training is as follows: Do not send them abroad to understand the programs, but take inspiration from the medieval rulers
 unhen aam naagarik ke rup main ek enjio chalaane ko kahen, chota kaarobaar shuru karne ko kahen, apane aap passport ke liye aavedan karne ko kahen or unke in anubhavon ke baad unase niyam banane ke liye kahen
 Abstraction is more in IAS training, while practicality is much less
 chauthi baat, iskaa bhi ek kaaran he ki rajya ke sudhaaron par bahut kam jor diya jaataa he
 Frankly, there is nothing difficult for big business in India
 uske paas vyavastha kaa apane dhang se istemaal karne liye sansaadhan hai or sarkari niyamon kaa kharch vah bardaasht kar saktaa he jabaki chote kaarobaar ko sari mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 But the result is that big business has never been a serious lobby for real reform in bureaucracy
 yah sirf apane vaaste chhot lene ke liye hi lobing karata he
 It never put collective pressure on the government to reform bureaucracy
 or phir rajya main vaicharik spashtataa kaa hona behad jaruri he
 Bureaucracy cannot be effectively improved until there is political clarity
 yah samasya kabhi nahin rahi ki naukarshah raajnneetikon ko bigaad dete hai, jo raajnneetik aisa kahata he, vah apni jimmedaari se batch rahaa he
 The problem arises when political bureaucrats want to aim guns with guns on their shoulders and in turn bureaucrats create a system of self-defense
 naukarshahi kaa swabhaav yah he ki uskaa apana koi nirnay nahin hota, isiilie sari jimmedaari raajnneetik tabake par aati he
 In short, for a good bureaucracy, you need a clear political leadership
 naukarshahi lakshyon ko saadhan samaj leti he, niyamon ko nateeja samajhti he or niyantran ko kaarykushalta samaj leti he, kyonki ham yah sawaal aksar nahin poochhate ki rajya kiske liye he
 The more work the state is randomly given, the more its priorities and work get disturbed
 agar lakshyon kaa sawaal hi spasht nahin he to jis str par faisle liye jate hai, vahaan to or bhi bhram kii sthiti hogi
 We are still one of the most centralized states in the world
 agar ham sachmuch gambhirtha se naukarshahi or samaaj main sudhaar chaahate hai to hamen apane rajya or samaaj main satta ke aabantan ke bare main sawaal karnaa hoga
 Only formal reform would be another exercise of bureaucracy against bureaucracy

 bagdadi iesas kaa chif or islamic state ke aatankwaadiyon kaa swayambhu khalipha bhi tha
 Baghdadi died in a us-led coalition airstrike on Iraq, in which Baghdadi was badly wounded on the 18th of last month when he, along with a group of his militants, came close to the Iraq and Syria border Returning to his whereabouts
 kareeb maheene bhar se bagdadi ke jakhmi hone kii khabaron ke bich mangalvaar ko radio iran ne pehali dfa is khabar kii pushti kii
 Although all countries, including the US, have refused to put their seal on the news till any concrete evidence is revealed, but the way Radio Iran has announced the disclosure of this news by quoting its sources, it is accepted It is known that Baghdadi has probably died now
 radio iran kii maane to bagdadi kii maut syria ke golan hits ilaake main ek israeli aspataal main hui, jahaan uskaa ilaaj israeli doctor kar rahe the or unhone ab ye saaf kar diya he ki bagdadi ab jinda nahin he
 Radio Iran quoted two Iraqi news agencies Alagad Press and al-yum al-tameen as saying
 isse pehle saal 2014 main hue ek hamale main wo bal-bal batch gaya tha, lekin is dfa uski kismat ne uskaa saath nahin diya
 According to sources, ISIS fighters took him to treatment in the occupied Golan Heights area of his occupied Syria, although it is a matter of surprise that he was treated in an Israeli hospital and the Israeli doctors continued to treat him, while Israel was in Baghdadi
 Enemy No
 1 and is considered close to America
 udhar, sutron ke hawaale se khabar ye bhi he ki ISIS ke pravaktaa ne bagdadi kii maut ke daavon ko sire se khaarij kar diya he
 a spokesman for ISIS in Mosul, Iraq, claimed that Baghdadi was safe and sound, leading its war in the Anbar region
 haalanki, hawaii hamale main bagdadi ke jakhmi hone kii khabaron ke baad march ke duusare-tisare hafte main uske uttaradhikari ke chunaav kii bhi baat charchaa bhi tej hui thi
 During this time, the name of a former teacher Abdul Rahman al-sijlar alias Abu Ala Aafri emerged as the new leader of ISIS
 lekin saath hi khabar ye bhi ai ki ISIS kii syria unit ne aafri kii aguwai ko manjuur nahin kiya tha
 However, while Baghdadi's death is a major blow to the Islamic sultanate of ISIS, his Israeli hospitalization is also highly mysterious

 The Congress and the Janata dal-secular (JD-S) have recommended disqualifying rebel mlas for neglect of Whip
 sarvocch nyaayalay ne 17 july ke aadesh main kaha tha ki vidhansabha adhyaksh dal-badal virdohi kanoon ke anusaar baagiyon ke istife par faisla lene ke liye swatantra hai, lekin baagiyon ne vidhansabha main matdaan main bhaag nahin liya
 The three-judge bench also said that the rebels cannot be forced to attend the house when their resignations are pending before the Speaker of the Assembly from 11 July
 nyaayalay ke 10 july ke nirdesh par unhone (baagiyon) ne phir se vidhansabha adhyaksh ko istipha saunpa tha

 'if the Speaker of the Assembly accepts the resignation or disqualifies the members, the strength of the Legislative Assembly will be reduced to 210 and half the number will be 106, which will enable the BJP to win with the support of two independents
