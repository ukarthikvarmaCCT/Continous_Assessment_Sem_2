 Independence Day Deshbhakti Geet: swatantraaa diwas (independence Day) ek aisa din he, jisapar har bhartiya ko garv mahasoos hota he
 This time the whole country is celebrating 73rd Independence Day
 isi din 1947 main bharat ko angreji shashan se aazaadee mili thi or desh ke pehle pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru ne laal kile kii pracheer se tirangaa (indian Flag) laharaaya tha
 We have also seen many stories of Independence Day through Bollywood films
 iske alaava bollywood main aise kai gane filmaae gaye hai, jinhen sunakar naa keval garv mahasoos hota he, balki kai baar logon ke rongte bhi khadeyho jate hai
 Apart from this, there are many such songs of Bollywood, through which people also get to hear the saga of independence
 yah pehla aisa krantikari geet he, jisane british hukumat kii neenden haraam kar di thim
 Released just five years before independence, this song took hold of many people
 film ‘kismat' ke is geet ne aazaadee ke aahvaan kaa ek dhardaar sandesh pesh kiya he
 Along with the lyrics of the song, Amirbai Karnatki's voice has made the song different
 film ‘shahid' ke liye rache gayi is aitihaasik geet ko master gulam haidar ne sangitabaddh kiya tha
 Mo
 rafi or saathiyon kii aawaaj main is geet ne us daur main bhi lokapriyata kaa parachamalaharaaya thaor apni tarah se film kii kamyaabi kaa sabase mahatvapurn pahalu sabit hua
 Moe with the melody of this song, his sensitive vocals and the chorus of the chorus throughout the song
 rafee or khan mastaan kii samvednaa charam par he
 The efforts of Mahatma Gandhi are best explained through this song
 is gane main kavi pan
 Pradeep has poured his emotions, making the song incomparable
 is gane ko jab filmaaya gaya, jab puraa bharat-china ke yuddh se upje traasadee or hatotsaah se duhkhi tha
 This song is also seen as arousing reverence and love for his army among Indians
 mo
 The song achieves extraordinary heights through Rafi's aching voice
 aaj bhi logon kii jubaan par maujuud is geet kaa pratikatmak sandesh yah bhi he ki ise rachane vaale teen mahaan log- madan mohan, caphi azmi or mo
 Rafi, somewhere in his pure creativity, was creating a wonderful chapter of hindu-muslim unity
 yah geet puri tarah rashtriyata ke sandesh se pagi hui aitihaasik film ‘shahid' kaa hissaa he
 Mukesh, Mahendra and Rajendra Mehta performed playback songs in this very emotional and heart-rending song based on the revolutionary sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru
 aaj bhi yah geet sunakar rulaai aati he or deshbhakti ke anuthe jazbe se bheetar tak bhigo daalati he
 It can be said that this song holds the rating of a great song in the songs of patriotism
 yah geet bharat ke gauravshaalee ateet, saanskrithik sampannataa or bhartiyata ke aahvaan kaa geet he, jise atyant sarthak arthon main geetkaar rajendra krishna ne kalambaddh kiya tha
 Mo
 rafee kii sadabahaar awaz main sampann hue is geet par prithviraj kapur kii cinemai abhivyakti bhi shandaar lagati he
 This song, which has always been evergreen, is like a new memory in the memory of everyone

 This order states that guest teachers should be appointed in place of all adhoc teachers and they are given daily wages at an hourly rate
 teachers kaa kahana he ki jab tak unki maangen nahin maani jaaengi tab tak wo apni hadtaal khatm nahin karenge
 At the same time, the proctor has issued a letter on Thursday morning calling the teachers' dharna and occupying the VC office illegal

 Some time ago a bank of China FINES pulled out a rota
 ye rota koi aam rota nahin tha
 It was for women working in Rota Bank
 jisamen unhen ye bataaya gaya tha ki wo kab pregnent ho sakati hai
 The bank had fixed the month of his pregnancy
 bank ne ye bhi notice jari kiya tha ki agar koi mahila karmchaaree unke tay samay se pehle pregnent ho gai to use harjaana dena hoga
 When i read this news, it was thought that all this would have happened in China
 bharat main koi aisa nahin kar saktaa lekin ye soch galat thi
 There is also a case of Noida similar to this case of China
 jahaan ek multinational company ne apni ekmaatr echaar karmchaaree ko matternity live dene se manaa kar diya
 Not only this, they were pressurized to either re-design themselves or they would be terminated
 ek ore jahaan pregnancy main saath,dekhbhaal or achche maahaulaki darkaar hoti he, vaise main ek hone vaali maa ko is tarah torchar karnaa vaaki kisi aparaadh se kam nahin
 This whole matter is of Radhika Gupta living in Noida
 28 saal kii radhika ne 2014 main radius sinerjee international privet limited naam kii company bataur assistant manager jwine kii thi
 In 2016, he made a family plan but did not abstain from office responsibilities
 7 maheene kii pregnent hone ke baavjood wo june 2016 tak offis jaati raheen
 But when he spoke to his company about maternity leave, the company's attitude put him in trouble
 company ne matternity live kii baat par to koi hami nahin bhari haa lekin unhen mently torchar karnaa jarur shuru kar diya
 Torture was so much that his health deteriorated
 unhen aspataal le janaa padaa jahaan doctor ne unhen rest karne kii salaah di
 Radhika wanted maternity leave from 1 September
 par tabiyat kharaab hone kii vajah se unhen medical live leni padi
 However, she had also assured the company that she would continue to look after the office work from home
 bajaay unke is jimmedaarana vyavhaar ko saraahne ke unki company ne unhen hi pareshaan karnaa shuru kar diya
 Radhika alone handled all the work of the company's HR department
 yahi vajah thi ki unhone ghar se madad karne kaa vaada kiya tha
 But the company told them clearly that they cannot give them maternity leave
 company ne na to unhen medical live di or matternity live par to baat karnaa bhi sahi nahin samajha
 One day a meeting was held with the top executives of the company and they were told in two words to either re-design themselves or else they would be terminated
 jab radhika ne rizin karne se manaa kar diya gaya to unhen termination letters thama diya gaya
 This letter broke Radhika inside
 jis samay main unhen zyada se zyada khush rahanaa chahie, unhen apana bhavishya andhkaar main najar aane laga
 No one would have felt the same after working hard day and night for a company for two years
 jabaki hamaare kanoon ke tahat garbhavastha ke dauraan kisi bhi mahila karmchaaree ko naukari se nahin nikaala ja saktaa
 But Radhika assimilated herself and stood up for a new fight
 unhone har us jagah apni aawaaj pahunchaai jahaan se unhen madad mil sakati he
 She also wrote a letter in the Ministry of Women and Child Development, on which she received an assurance from Maneka Gandhi to take appropriate steps
 hamaare desh main mahilaon ke hiton ke liye kai tarah ke kanoon hai
 For government employees, 26 weeks or six months maternity leave is already given
 vahiin nijee companiyaan adhiktam teen maheene kaa avkaash detii hai
 But by changing the Maternity Benefit Act 1961, private companies have to give 6 months maternity leave to their women employees under a new bill
 is vidheyak ko aane vaale satr main pesh karne kii yojana he
 In such a situation, Radhika's fight is human as well as legal
 saath hi unki ye kahani un sabhi mahilaon ke liye bhi ek sikh he jo paristhitiyon se darkar shant ho jaati hai or ghutane tech detii hai
 Another battle has erupted between bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi and Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal fighting the battle for political supremacy in Varanasi over the books on him

 anil vij ne kaha ki maamla atyant gambhir he
 So they have decided to send a team to Sonepat for investigation
 unhone kaha ki agar ye medical ke niyamon ke khilaaf he or ise andekha nahin kiya ja saktaa

 The terrorist attack on a convoy of security forces in Pulawama, Jammu and Kashmir, is said to be a bigger attack than the attack on the army headquarters in Uri sector on 18 September 2016
 is hamale main 44 jawan shahid ho gaye hai or 45 ghayal hai
 Pakistan-based terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammad has claimed responsibility for this attack
 uri main sena ke camp par hue hamale kaa badla lene ke liye bhartiya sena ne pakistan kii seemaa main daakhil hokar sargical strike kii thi
 Despite this, the terrorist incidents sponsored from across the border did not stop
 kashmir ghati main sena kaa oparation ol out abhiyaan jari he
 Under which, in the last three years, security forces have killed 586 terrorists in the last three years
 yah jaankaree kendriya grih mantralay ne haal hi main rajyasabha main di thi
 Apart from this, violation of ceasefire on the Line of Control from Pakistan also continued, but the army personnel responded by breaking their mouth
 seemaa par lagaataar munh kii kha rahe pakistan ne ek baar phir sajishon ko anjaam dena shuru kar diya
 Under which attempts to infiltrate from across the border intensified, as well as youth in the valley were also made part of this conspiracy
 bataa den ki kashmir kii suraksha ko khatra bataate hue centre main sattarudh bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne pipuls democratic party (pidipi) se samarthan waapas le liya tha
 Since then the center has direct control of the valley
 iske chalate surakshabalon dwaara lagaataar aatankiyon ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaaya ja rahaa he
 However, the security forces have also succeeded in this
 lekin in sabake baavjood itani badi aatanki ghatana hone kaa matlab yah he ki aatankiyon ke napak hausale kam nahin hue hai
 It is being told that the road on which this attack took place in Pulwama in Kashmir was closed due to snowfall for the past several days and it was opened yesterday
 is hamale ko anjaam dene ke liye aatankiyon ne surakshabalon ke kafile ke ek vaahan par aatmghaatee hamalaa kiya
 The convoy consisted of more than 50 vehicles carrying 2500 personnel
 surakshabalon kii itani badi movement or agenciyon ke alert ke baavjood is hamale kaa hona suraksha main bahut badi chook kaha ja saktaa he
 After the surgical strike, it was believed that Pakistan would learn from this and control its nefarious plans
 nizaam badalane ke baad pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne bhi aman-o-amaan kii baat kii thi
 But Imran also failed to stop the yield of terrorism on Pakistani soil
 iskaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki thik 10 din pehle 5 farvari ko karachi main khule-aam aatank kaa aakaa moulana masood ajahar kaa chota bhai or jaish-e-mohammad kaa sargana moulana rauf asagar raily karata he or bharat ko dahala dene kaa elaan karata he
 At the beginning of the year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his interview to ANI that we have fought the 1965, 1971, Kargil war with Pakistan
 ek ladaai (sargical strike) se pakistan sudhar jayega, ye sochna bahut badi galati hogi
 Pakistan will take more time to improve
 baharhaal pulavama main hue is bade aatanki hamale se pakistan ek baar phir benakaab hua he to vahiin desh main suraksha ko lekar bhi bada sawaal khadaa hua he
 The second 'weekend Ka War' episode of Bigg Boss 13 marked the first nomination of this season
 pehle nomination main dalajit cor ghar se beghar ho gai hai
 But people have not liked Daljit's homelessness at all
 soshal media yugers big bos ke ghar se dalajit ko nikaalane kaa jamkar virodh kar rahe hai
 Actually, Daljit's journey to Bigg Boss house has been very good
 2 hafton kii jarney main dalajit ko naa to kisi se budtamiji karte hue dekha gaya or naa hi kisi se jabardastee ladaai karte hue
 Daljit has played his game in Bigg Boss with plenty of grace
 khud salmaan khan ne bhi dalajit ko ghar se avict karte hue sho main unki jarney kii kaaphi saraahna kii
 The way Daljit has put his personality in front of Bigg Boss house, fans have liked him a lot
 yahi vajah he ki sho se sabase pehle dalajit ke ghar se beghar hone se phans kaaphi niraash hai or soshal media par apni naaraazgi jaahir kar rahe hai
 Fans believe that Daljit's departure from Bigg Boss house is very unfit
 kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki dalajit kii jagah shahanaz cor ko ghar se beghar hona chahie tha
 At the same time, some people say that Koyna could also be evacuated from the house instead of Daljati

 Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh is in the headlines for resorting to tantra-mantras and tricks to come to power for the fourth time
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki wo kisi ek sadhak kii salaah ke baad formula 19-04 ke pher main pad gaye hai, haalanki khud raman singh ne is tarah kii baton or vipaksh ke aaropon ko sire se khaarij kar diya he
 He made it clear that he had no faith in Tantra Mantra
 raman singh ne congress par chutki lete hue kaha ki agali baar jab gaadi luungaa to congress se puch kar gadiyon kaa number tay karuunga
 Every number is lucky for them
 unke mutabik gadiyon kaa number parivahan vibhaag tay karata he wo nahin
 Actually, there is a debate in the political corridors regarding the 19-04 formula
 vipaksh ne is formule ko un logon se joda he jo mukhyamantri ke kareeb rah kar tantra mantra or puja paath ke maamalon main charchit rahete hai
 According to reports, Chief Minister Sachivayal has purchased 19 Pajero vehicles and the number of all these vehicles is 0004 which means being in power for the fourth time and 19 trains means completing 19 years as Chief Minister
 chhattisgarhmen 2018 main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai lihaaja mukhyamantri raman singh kaa nayaa kaaron kaa kafila charchaa kaa vishay bana hua he
 All the Pajero vehicles included are of same color and same number
 suraksha ke lihaaj se hi sahi sabhi gadiyon kaa number 0004 he
 Not only this, it is also being said that the color of these vehicles is black so that it can be saved from any kind of sight
 bataaya ja rahaa he kimukhyamantrischivalay ke paas aisi chamchamati 19 gaadiyaan hai
 All these vehicles have been purchased a week in advance
 puja anushthan ke baad mukhyamantri raman singh or unke sahyogi puure laav lashkar ke saath is nae vaahan main savaar hue hai
 In a special muhurat of the day, a convoy of vehicles came out of the Chief Minister's residence
 jisane bhi mukhyamantri raman singh ke is kafila ko pehali baar dekha wo dekhtaa rah gaya
 The old convoy of Chief Minister Raman Singh had Tata Safari vehicles
 mukhyamantriraman sinhane puraane kafile ko haal hi main tyaagaa he
 According to one information, most of the vehicles involved in this convoy were more than 10 years old
 ek jaisi tamaam safari gadiyon main savaar hokar mukhyamantri raman singh ne lagaataar teesri baar chhattisgarh main bijepi kaa paracham laharaaya he
 In the 2003, 2008 and 2013 assembly elections, he has defeated Congress three times in a row riding on this convoy
 mukhyamantri sachivalay ke afasaron ke mutabik pagero gaadiyaan suraksha kii drushti se zyada kargar hai
 Whatever the Chief Minister's camp may say, but the political corridor is hot about the special number and strength of new trains
 jyotish shastri bhi ise lekar kai tarah ke daawey kar rahe hai
 What says on the formula of 19-04 According to astrologer Jyotish Shastri Govindagiri Goswami, the number 13, 04, 22 and 31 on numerology is Rahu's master
 jaisaa ki 04 he apane vaahan main ye chatur bhav se dekha jaataa he
 This is 19 which is the number of 19 trains in the horoscope
 dekhen to 9 or ek kaa mulank ek he, jiskaa swami surya he
 The Sun, whose planet is its owner, is its owner, the victory flag of such a man does not stop anywhere
 wo aatma kaa kaarak hota
 King Chakravati will become the sum of emperor everywhere
 raman singh ke puraane gadiyon ke kafile main pehle darjan bhar gaadiya thim
 The number of all these trains was 107
 jyotish shastriyon ke mutabik 107 kaa mulank 08 hota he
 This is the number of Saturn, so Chief Minister Raman Singh has been in power for 14 consecutive years
 jyotishi kaa maananaa he kimukhyamantri raman singhki kundali main saal 2015 se rahu kii antardasha chal rahi he, lekin 2018 ke shuruaati maheenon main iske behatar parinaam saamne aaenge
 Chief Minister Raman Singh is the first Chief Minister of BJP to hold the Chief Minister's chair continuously for record breaking days
 bataur mukhyamantri ve 12 disambar ko 14 saal puure karne vaale hai
 For so many days, no one has been a consistent Chief Minister in BJP
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki 2018 main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main chauthi baar baaji maarane ke liye mukhyamantri raman singh ne qamar kas lee he
 Seeing this bet of Raman Singh, who is well-versed in content, price, punishment, distinction, the Congress has become stung
 use 19-04 ke formule se apane armaanon par pani phirata najar aa rahaa he
 According to Congress General Secretary Ramesh Verlani, new vehicles have been purchased at the behest of a tantric
 unke mutabik tantric ne kaha he ki chaar number rakhane se chauthi pari bhi bijepi jeetegi
 He sarcastically said that the fourth innings would be achieved through work and not from the number game
 iske liye hi 19 -04 ke yoga ko siddh kiya ja rahaa he
 On the other hand, Chief Minister Raman Singh's convoy is trying to find the pulse of the state, rejecting all the allegations of opposition
 shahari kshetron se lekar gramin anchalon tak yah kafila farrate se daud rahaa he
 Whatever the reason, Chief Minister Raman Singh has come under attack from the opposition for this new convoy, although there is a large section in the state, who is feeling good seeing the new convoy of Chief Minister
 haalanki kisi bhi depyutesan main aakhri faisla lenaa asisi kaa hi kaam he, lekin is maamle main kya niyamon ko isliye dhilaa kiya gaya, kyonki afasar ek bade netaa ke rishtedaar hai
 That too when the Ministry of Personnel was repeatedly in denial
 or kya ye sach nahin ki jo kaam niyam nahin karvaa pate, vah kaam netaaon kii chitthee karvaa leti he
 Now one game is over and another starts
 ji haa, kaamanwealth games kii samaapti ke saath hi logon ne duusare khel kii shuruyaat kar di he
 All the people have gathered to take credit for the success and the opponents have pulled each other's legs
 ek tarah kii raajnneetik sadaandh vaise bhi hawa main ghul chuki he
 In the midst of this success, someone has also started shigufa that after successful completion of Commonwealth Games, why should India not organize Olympic Games now
 jitna bada aayojan hoga, utani zyada bandarbaant hogi
 Write Qamar Waheed Naqvi
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki ye khel behad safal rahe or iskaa shrey un sabhi khilaadiyon or athleton ko jaataa he, jinhone apane dam par bharat ko 101 padak dilaae or puri duniya main bharat kii vijay pataakaa laharaai
 We all know how sports organizations work in our country and what their contribution is in the rise of sports in the country
 hamaare un khilaadiyon ne, jinhen shaayad bahut hi kam log jaanate the, unhone apni mehnat or lagan se in khelon main shandaar safalataa pai
 These games have created confidence among the youth living in small cities and towns of the country that they can also see high dreams
 sahi myne main in khelon kii vaastavik safalataa yahi he
 All the credit goes to the players, who were never paid attention by the media who ran behind cricket
 aise khilaadiyon ko salaam
 We are proud of them
 ab sawaal uthta he ki kya iske baad kuch badalegaa? kya ab hamaare khilaadi yah ummid kar sakate hai ki unhen aisa maahaul milegaa, jisamen ve apane khel ko or nikhaar saken or khud ko vaaki vishwastareey bana saken? kya yah ek rashtriya agenda ban paaegaa?ek sabase bada sawaal yah bhi he ki in khelon se jude bhrashtachar or laaparvaahee kii jo khabaren pichley kuch maheene se aa rahi thim, ve khelon ke shor main dab gayi
 Will they be investigated and will the culprits be punished? Or will they all be forgotten after the success of the games? If that happens, it will be the most tragic outcome of the Games

 Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti said on Friday that declaring the suspects 'terrorists' on the basis of the Sutli bomb and linking them to ISIS was immature
 haal hi main kai jagahon par chhapemari ke dauraan enie dwaara 10 logon ko giraftaar kiye jane or unase jabt saamagree ke sandarbh main tanj kasate hue unhone yah baat kahi
 The National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested 10 people on 26 December, revealing a suspected terrorist group inspired by ISIS
 agency kaa kahana tha ki ve dilli or uttari bharat ke duusare hisson main rajanetaaon or sarkari pratishthanon ko nishaanaa banaate hue aatmghaatee hamale or bam dhamaake karne kii sajeesh kar rahe the
 Mehbooba linked these arrests to the election, stating that the NIA should 'learn from past events' when the accused had to be released after a long hearing
 unhone twitor par kaha, "rashtriya suraksha sarvopari he lekin sandigdhon ko sutali bamon ke adhaar par aatankwaadi ghoshit karnaa, unhen khatarnaak aies (iesas) se jodna aparipakvata he
 This has ruined his and family's life before

 "national security is supreme
 But declaring suspects as terrorists on the basis of Sutli bombs, associating with the dreaded IS is premature
 It has already devastated their lives and families
 NIA must learn from earlier episodes in which the accused were acquitted after decades— Mehbooba Mufti (@mehboobamufti)december 28, 2018 Citing recent statements made by Union ministers like Nirmala Sitharaman and Piyush Goyal, former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha said on Saturday that such 'unattainable' statements of the domestic economy that are beset by the economic crisis will not be good

 These strange statements will not lead to the welfare of the economy
 lekin inase sarkaar kii chhavi par asar jarur padegaa
 He said he was "surprised" by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's recent statement about online taxi service providers like Ola and Uber in the backdrop of the country's automobile sector slowdown
 sinha ne sawaal kiya, 'agar ola-ubar jaisi companiyon ke chalate yatri gadiyon kii bikri main giravat ai, to phir dopahiyaa vaahanon or trakon kii bikri main giravat kyon aayi?' sinha ne bijepi ke do anya mantriyon ke bayanon kaa ullekh karte hue tanj kiya, 'bihar ke vitt mantri (susheel kumaar modi) kah rahe hai ki sawan-bhado ke chalate desh main mandi kaa maahaul he

 bharat kii arthvastha tabhi tarakkee karegi, jab madhyapradesh ke mandsaur jaise ilaakon ke kisaan tarakkee karenge
 Sinha also said that the country is facing the current economic crisis due to not taking timely reform measures in the past years
 unhone kaha, 'hamen kam se kam aath pratishat kii dar se vikaas karnaa chaiye tha
 But in the first quarter of the current financial year, the GDP growth rate came down to five percent
 'purv vitt mantri ne daawa kiya ki jidipi vikaas dar main teen pratishat ke is antar se keval ek timahi main desh kii aamadani main chah lakh karod rupee kaa nuksaan hua he
 Asked about the government's new plan for merger of public sector banks, he said, "I am not opposed to merger of public sector banks

 com / jxk9dcinhf is saal july main shraddha kii film 'half garlfriend' aegi jisamen arjuna kapur unke saath najar aaenge
 The film is based on Chetan Bhagat's novel 'half Girlfriend' which is directed by Mohit Suri
 goa ke mukhyamantri or bijepi netaa manohar parrikar kaa kahana he ki aam aadmi party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal apni saadagi kaa vigyaapan karte hai or saadagi jab vigyaapan se hoti he, tab vah marketing ranneeti hoti he
 At the BJP Law Cell conference, Parrikar said, "I became the youngest RSS driver of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) at the age of 24
 sangh kaa vyakti hone ke kaaran meri saadagi mere swabhaav kaa hissaa ban gai
 He said that just as the check of new and unknown traders does not run in the market, in the same way Kejriwal is new in politics, so the public should first examine them for three to four years
 parrikar ne kaha, abhi to khud kejariwal ko hi nahin pataa hoga ki unke saath koun, or kaise log kyon jude hai
 Parrikar said that Kejriwal 'entertained' the people of Delhi for 49 days, now he has gone there to 'entertain' the people of Varanasi
 goa ke mukhyamantri ne kaha ki congress ek chhed vaali tank he or congress ke mantri is tank ke chhed hai
 These ministers take the tax water of the public out of corruption

 Senior BJP leader LK Advani seems to have lost his room in the Parliament House, which he had held for the last ten years as the acting president of the NDA
 yahi nahin loksabhaa main bhi siton kaa aavanton nahin hone ke kaaran unke baithne kaa koi niyat sthaan nahin tha
 The former Deputy Prime Minister's loss of room number 4 was indicated by the fact that his name was not on the outside of the room, while NDA president Atal Bihari Vajpayee's nameplate was placed outside the same room
 vaajapeyi kharaab swasthya ke kaaran is kaksh main nahin baithte hai or adwani hi yahaan baitha karte the
 The absence of Advani's 'nameplate' and the plank of the post of NDA working president was evident as the developments took place at a time when new allocation of rooms was taking place after the formation of the new Lok Sabha
 bijepi netaa 86 varshiya adwani ne bijepi sansadeey dal ke karyaalay main aaraam kiya, jahaan aam taur par saamaanya party netaa baithte hai
 Though Advani is the president of the BJP parliamentary party, he sat on the couch instead of sitting in the main chair of the room
 adwani ke nikat sutron ne is mudde ko khaas tavajjo nahin di
 He said that there is no confusion
 saath hi vishwaas jataayaa ki adwani ko jald hi cameraa aavanton ho jayega
 The Lok Sabha Secretariat said that it has no role in the allocation of rooms
 sadan ke bheetar bhi adwani bhram kii sthiti main the ki kahaan baithen
 He wanted to sit in the second row, but Parliamentary Affairs Minister m Venkaiah Naidu begged him to sit in the next row
 uske baad vah grih mantri rajnath singh, videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj or khaadya evam naagarik aapurti mantri ram vilaas paswan ke saath agali pankti main baithe
 Advani was seated next to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, but today he flatly refused to sit there
 dopaher main jab vah sadan main dobaaraa laute to seat talashne lage or antat: aathvin pankti main baith gaye
 His presence on the back bench was realized when BJP MP from Rajasthan Arjun Meghwal went to take Advani's blessing after taking oath
 uske baad ek anya saansad rajyavardhan singh rathod, filmon se raajnneeti main aae vinod khanna or hema malini bhi unke paas gaye
 Yogi Adityanath, MP from Gorakhpur, also spent some time with Advani

 The Delhi government today issued a notification making it mandatory with immediate effect

 Previously retired general of the army and now lieutenant general of the army, both these officers are claiming in the same note that 'there is no danger from the Adarsh building
 ' Former Army Lieutenant General Tejinder Singh, who appeared before the Adarsh commission, has once again questioned the claims of the Ministry of Defense
 jahaan raksha mantralay daawa kar rahaa he ki adarsh imaarat kolaba ke sena base ke liye ek bada khatra he vahiin kamishan ke saamne pesh hue in donon adhikariyon ne kaha he ki khatre kii koi baat nahin he
 Lieutenant General Singh told the commission that there was a rumor about the Adarsh building that army people are also getting flats in the Civilian building being built in Colaba area
 is afvaah ke bare main mujhe meri dilli posting ke dauraan pataa chalaa
 The posting in Mumbai took place in the year 2005 but applied in 2006 for a flat in the building
 aavedan dene se pehle imaarat or jagah ke bare main sari baaten pataa kar lee thim
 Lieutenant General Singh claimed that the entire Colaba station has only residential military buildings and not an army stock of arms
 aise main adarsh imaarat se kaise khatra ho saktaa he? singh ne bataaya, adarsh imaarat se sirf sena ko rasad pahunchane vaale wing ke depo ko dekha ja saktaa he, kya ye rasad wing koi samvedansheel lokation he? Singh also told the commission that he did the analysis until he was the GOC and according to him, Adarsh was not a threat to the army in any way
 singh kaa daawa he kii adarsh hi kya base ke aasapaas ke kisi bhi hai rice imaarat se base ko koi khatra nahin he
 The comments media se baat karte hue singh ne kaha ki ab to is baat kii jaanch kerani chahie ki is puure maamle ko kisne galat tareeke se uchhaala he
 Former army chief Deepak Kapoor, who appeared before the commission before this, also denied any threat from Adarsh
 deepak kapur ke is bayaan ke baad desh ke rakshaamantri antni ko safai deni padi thi
 It is worth noting that Kapoor and Singh have a flat in the building and in such a situation, it is impossible to tell their building a threat to the army base
 adarsh kamishan ke saamne pesh hue sena ke purv leftinent general tejinder singh ne ek baar phir raksha mantralay ke daavon par sawalia nishaan laga diya he
 While the Ministry of Defense is claiming that the Adarsh building is a major threat to the army base of Colaba, the two officers appearing before the commission have said that there is no question of danger
 leftinent general singh ne kamishan ko bataaya ki adarsh imaarat ke bare main afvaah chal rahi thi ki kolaba ilaake main ban rahi civillian imaarat main sena ke logon ko bhi flats mil rahaa he
 i came to know about this rumor during my Delhi posting
 mumbai main posting saal 2005 main hui lekin imaarat main flats ke liye saal 2006 main aavedan kiya
 All the things about the building and the place were known before the application was made
 leftinent general singh ne daawa kiya ki puure kolaba stesan main sirf sena kii rihaishi imaaraten hai na ki sena kaa koi hathiyaaron kaa bhandar
 In such a situation, how can there be danger from ideal building? Singh said, Adarsh building can be seen only for the depot of the wing that supplies the army, is this logistics wing a sensitive location? singh ne kamishan ko yah bhi bataaya ki unke jiosi rahane tak unhone vishleshan kiya or uske anusaar adarsh kisi bhi tarah se sena ke liye khatra nahin he
 Singh claims that there is no threat to the base from any high-rice building around the base
 tippaniyan Talking to the media, Singh said that now it should be investigated who has thrown the whole case wrongly
 iske pehle kamishan ke saamne pesh hue purv sena pramukh deepak kapur ne bhi adarsh se kisi bhi prakaar kaa khatra hone se inkaar kiya tha
 After this statement of Deepak Kapoor, the country's Defense Minister Antony had to be clarified
 gauratlab he ki kapur or singh kaa imaarat main flats he or aise main unka imaarat ko sena ke base ke liye khatra na bataanaa laazmi he

 rigerv bank of india kii ore se jari notebandi ke aankadon ne bharat sarkaar ko baikfoot par laa diya he
 According to the data released by the RBI, the purpose for which demonetisation was done, it was far from the big goal
 aankade aane ke baad vipaksh or sarkaar main jubaani jang chal rahi he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is presenting a clarification on behalf of the government
 jetali ne is dauraan notebandi ke kai tark die
 What did Modi say? On November 8, 2016, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetisation in his address to the country, what arguments were made during that time
 in par ek najar daalate hai
 
 
 During the announcement of demonetisation, PM Modi gave a lot of demonetisation arguments
 PM ne kaha tha ki bharat ke aarthik system main cash kii taadaad kaaphi zyada he, hamen jald hi cashles iconomi kii ore kadam badhaane honge
 The PM had said that the chances of corruption in the system increases due to more cash
 iske dwaara hawala karne waalon ko badhaava miltaa he, jisase kaledhan main bhi badhotaree hoti he
 Modi had said that to stop all these activities, from the midnight of November 8, 2016, they are deciding to discontinue 500 and 1000 notes
 ye kadam bhrashtachar, kaledhan or nakli noton ke khilaaf ladaai ko tej karegaa
 i appeal to all countrymen to help in this Mahayagya
 kya flop sabit hui notebandi? RBI ke aankadon ke baad vipaksh hamalavar, jetali ne di safayeeb kya bole arun jetali?aankade saamne aane ke baad vitt mantri arun jetali ko turant media ke saamne aana padaa
 The government says that those who talk and criticize the failure of demonetisation are confused
 aise log notebandi ke puure uddeshy ko samaj nahin paa rahe hai
 The Income Tax Department is investigating
 After the demonetisation, some people are commenting that the only purpose of demonetisation was that people should not deposit money and money will be confiscated
 jin logon ne jivan main kabhi kaale dhan ke khilaaf jang nahin ladi, wo shaayad is puri prakriya kaa uddeshy samaj nahin paae
 This was not the purpose of confiscating money
 banking system main paisa aa jaae to iskaa matlab ye nahin ki wo puraa paisa vaid he
 The Income Tax Department conducts a full investigation against this money
 yahi kaaran he lakhon logon ko notice par daalaa gaya he
 One of the direct effects is that the direct tax base has increased
 usase jiesti kaa prabhaav bhi badha he
 Government vs Opposition on demonetization figures: Understand who passes and who fails? 'every deposit amount is not valid' Arun Jaitley said that the purpose of demonetisation was to increase the tax base
 iskaa yah bhi ye uddeshy tha ki kaledhan jamaa karne vaale logon ke khilaaf kaarywahi ho
 Also be able to separate fake notes from the system
 saath hi makasad tha les cash vyavastha bananaa
 The strong condemnation of the separatists and the demonetisation have also caused economic injury to the separatists
 aatankwaadiyon ke paas paise jabt hue hai
 In such a situation, if money comes in the system then it does not become legitimate money
 arun jetali ne kaha ki sarkaar ke saare uddeshy trek par hai
 Jaitley's clarification on the RBI report - Demonetization was not intended to increase the scope of demonetisation
 The target was to increase the scope of demonetisation
 notebandi se nakli noton kaa pataa chalaa
 Its goal was to increase the scope of tax
 notebandi se aatankwaad or naksalwad par asar padaa
 Ban on black money in elections Next goaljetly said that the purpose of demonetisation was to reduce cash transactions
 nakadi kaa aadan-pradaan 17 pratishat kam ho gaya he
 The impact of demonetisation is on the right track and the steps that the center will take in future will be based on that
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki sarkaar kaa aglaa kadam chunaav main kaledhan par roak lagaana he
 Jaitley said that those who have little understanding of dealing with black money are linking the cash in banks with demonetisation
 notebandi kaa uddeshy arthvyavastha main nakadi par nirbharta kam karnaa, digitalykaran karnaa, kar dayera badhanaa or kaale dhan se nipatna tha
 There has been a decline in terrorist and separatist activities in Chhattisgarh and Jammu Kashmir due to lack of cash after demonetisation

 ’ Now Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also come to the rescue of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley surrounded in DDCA case
 modi ne mangalvaar ko sansadeey party meeting main khulkar jetali kii tarif kii or bole- jetali paak saaf hai
 Just as Advani proved to be impeccable, Jaitley would also go out without a spot
 badnaam karne kii koshishpiem ne kaha ki congress pryojit taur par sarkaar ko badnaam karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 He exhorted all mps that there is no need to panic
 adwani par bhi galat aarope lagaae gaye the or ab jetali par bhi galat aarope lagaae gaye hai

 Especially whether the sweetness of sugar will now turn into bitterness? Import duty on sugar has been increased in the country
 matlab saaf he ki sarkaar chaahati he ki museebaton se jujh rahe desh ke chini udyog ko madad mili or sasti videshi chini ke aayaat se use hone vaale nuksaan ko roka ja sake
 Actually, till now the import duty on sugar was just 15 percent, which has been increased to 40 percent

 What is the intention of the government that the sugar industry of the country should be encouraged and their accumulated stock should be sold in the market of the country itself

 But questions are also being raised on the government's decision
 ashanka jataai ja rahi he ki isse chini ke daam bad sakate hai
 What are the experts? People associated with the Chinese industry say that there will be some increase in the price of sugar
 lekin isse is udyog or usase jude lakhon kisaanon kaa bhala hi hoga
 However, economists say that it is possible that it will not increase the price of sugar too much, because the country still does not import too much sugar

 upabhokta maamalon ke mantri ram vilaas paswan ne kaha he ki desh main pyaaj or tamaato kii keemton main maujuuda teji siginal he
 Paswan said that new crop of onion and tomato from different growing states will start coming to the market soon, after which the situation will be normal in a week
 haalanki kendriya mantri kaa yah bayaan sachai se thodaa kam he
 Onion and tomato prices are not increasing because it is the season of growth
 ijapha isliye ho rahaa he ki kendra sarkaar ne beete maheenon main cold storage main rakhi rabi kii paidaavaar ko export kar diya he
 This export came after agricultural experts speculated that the Gaya monsoon (southwest) was not good for onion-tomato kharif yields and that new crop yields were likely to decline
 nai paidaavaar se ek saptaah main sudharegi sthiti?pyaaj kii jald taiyaar hone vaali kharif kismein dilli kii mandiyon main aane lagi hai tathaa vibhinn pyaaj utpaadak rajyon main yah fasal nikaali ja rahi he jo jald hi bazaar main aani shuru hogi

 ise bhi padhein: videsh gaya cold storage main rakhaa stock, sasti pyaaj ke liye karen kharif fasal kaa intjarkendriya mantri ne bataaya ki tamaato or pyaaj kii keemat main vruddhi siginal he
 With the improvement in arrival of new onion crop, prices will start to decrease in a week or so
 unhone kaha ki bazaar main aktubar se jaldi taiyaar hone vaali kismon kaa mandiyon main aavak shuru ho chuki he
 According to trade figures of Rs 51 kg onion and Rs 80 kg tomato, the retail price of onion is running at Rs 51 per kg in the national capital, while tomato is priced at Rs 80 per kg
 madar deyari ke bikri kendra main pyaaj 47 rupee kilo bik rahaa he or tamaato kii keemat 70 rupee kilo he
 Sowing of onion tomatoes, which was 25 per cent lower during the kharif season, said the consumer affairs secretary Avinash Srivastava said that the soon-to-be-prepared varieties of onions have started coming to the mandis and producing states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh Fresh crop is being extracted in unhone kaha ki pyaaj kii jald taiyaar hone vaali kismon ke kheti ke rakabe main 25 pratishat kii kami hone kii vajah se pyaaj kii keemten dawaab main hai
 But the area of kharif crop of onion and late kharif crop is far better and production is also likely to be better
 ise bhi padhein: ab number-1 banane main chukaa bharat to 200 saal baad aayega numbegast main 125 fisadi adhik tha exportgauratlab he ki isse pehle agast maheene main bhi kendra sarkaar ne daawa kiya tha ki ek maheene main nai fasal aane ke baad keemton main sthirataa aa jaaegi

 According to the export figures for this quarter, onion exports from the country increased by about 125% in the first month of the financial year 2017-18
 april ke dauraan desh se kul 3,20,943 ton pyaaj export hua he, jabaki pichley saal is dauraan desh se sirf 1,42,767 ton pyaaj niryaat ho paaya tha
 This trend of exports continued continuously throughout the quarter

 Due to this, the area under sowing was reduced in many areas important for these crops
 jiske baad anumaan tha ki kharif fasal main pyaaj or tamaato kii paidaavaar saamaanya se kam rahegi
 It is important to note that after this warning, it was necessary that the country was given more preference to keep the crop kept in cold storage than exporting it, so that the stock can be used to curb the rising prices at present

 rowepane desh main unani mithkon main varnit jhak safed pankhons vaale ghode pegasus ko jaanane vaale na baraabar hi the, lekin achaanak yah naam sabaki jubaan par he kyonki is naam kaa smart spiware logon kii jasusi kar rahaa he
 On November 1, the English newspaper Indian Express reported that at least two dozen Indian journalists, activists and others were spied by the Israeli spyware Pegasus
 whatsap or uski mul company fasebuk ne california kii ek sangheey adaalat main spiware nirmaataa israeli company enesao group technology par mukadmaa daayar kiya ki usne whatsap sarwar ke jariye 1,400 smartphone ko hack kiya tha
 It was revealed in May, 2019, in order to identify and block the source of a massive cyber attack through which more than 100 human rights activists, journalists and others around the world were targeted
 to kya whatsap kaa and tu and ancripshan surakshit nahin he? haa, duusare log aapke phone ke massej ko nahin pard sakate
 But to read that message, it is decrypted on your handset
 aapke phone main maujuud spiware aapke disple yaa keyboard, camera yaa mike ko intercept kar saktaa he, or phone par aapaki baatcheet, yaa phir aapke kamare main ho rahi baatcheet ko sun saktaa he
 Usually spyware is activated only when you click on a link in its message
 lekin pegasus ne whatsap kii ek aisi kamajori (jise may main dur kar liya gaya) kaa phayda uthaaya jisamen keval ek video kol se handset main spiware install ho jaataa he
 You don't even need to answer that call - just by filling a missed call, spyware is downloaded and installed in your phone
 phir, android yaa ioes software kii kamajoriyon ke jariye mike yaa camere ko sanchalit karne lagata he
 Pegasus could then do everything you do with things like reading your messages in your phone, turning on the camera or microphone, adding and deleting files in the phone, and manipulating the phone's data
 november ke shuruaati kuch dinon main, patrakaron ne un do darjan se adhik naamon ko trek kiya jinhen whatsap dwaara sampark karke bataaya gaya tha ki unka phone hack ho chukaa tha
 Among them were activists, journalists, lawyers and a leader of the opposition
 ye sabhi yaa to sarkaar ke khilaaf mukhar rahane vaale log the yaa phir sarkaar ke un aalochakon kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale vakil
 The NSO Group states that Pegasus is sold only to government agencies and is not intended for use against journalists and activists
 yah 'kanoonee jasusi' upkaran sarkaron ke liye uplabdh he, jinamein sandigdh maanavadhikaar record vaale shashan bhi shaamil hai
 The Saudi Arabian government used this spyware to spy (and later kill) its adversary, Khashji
 2016 main enesao ne kathith taur par spiware install karne ke 5,00,000 dollar kii fees ke alaava, har 10 divaais ko hack karne ke liye 6,50,000 dollar liye gaye
 So which government on this earth will spend so much money to target Indian critics, dissidents, journalists? No Sherlock Holmes will have to be engaged to find out that only the Government of India can be probable
 hamaari sarkaar ne isse inkaar kiya he or whatsap par hi baras padi ki usne pehle kyon nahin bataaya
 But he was informed
 yah to sibar suraksha kii sarkari agency siiarti-in kii website par bhi tha
 However, the note dated May 17 was immediately removed from the website and government sources told the media that the whatsapp note was so technical that it was beyond the comprehension of cert-in
 is par whatsap kaa kahana he ki usne sitambar maheene main bhi saamaanya angreji main duusari baar patr likhakar sarkaar ko isaki soochna di thi, jisamen yah ullekh kiya gaya tha ki pegasus ke jariye 121 bharatiyon ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 Government officials told the media that all this, and the timing of the US lawsuit, are questionable
 yah aise samay ho rahaa he jab bharat sarkaar soshal media ke sandeshon kaa pataa lagane ke liye intermediris se jude kanoon ko badalane ja rahi he
 Why does the government want to monitor whatsapp messages? Because people have lost their lives due to the fake news forwarded
 2017 main jharkhand main maare gaye saat logon se afvaahon kaa jo silsilaa shuru hua to do varshon main 50 se adhik hamale darj hue
 Your data is not yours According to India's IT law and its rules, an 'intermediary or intermediary' is not liable for any third-party information or content as long as it acts in a legitimate manner
 sarkaar ab un niyamon ko agali janvari main sanshodhit karegi, kyonki uskaa kahana he ki intermediris ko galat soochnaaon ke prasar ko rokane ke liye or adhik praavdhaan karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 The government wants whatsapp and other platforms to monitor messages and, if asked, locate the original sender of the forwarded message, and destroy the content in question
 lekin whatsap ancrypted he
 a third party, even whatsapp itself, can neither read those messages or intercept calls (without spyware on the handset)
 isiilie sarkaar or sattarudh dalon ke logon sahit bahut se anya log bhi phone kol ke liye whatsap kaa istemaal karte hai
 To obey the government, whatsapp must eliminate encryption
 isse bharat main 40 karod or duniyabar main kareeb 1
 Lack of privacy protection laws will open the way for potential surveillance and harassment of agencies for people using 5 billion whatsapp
 haa, china aisa karata he
 He monitors and controls wechat's messages, and the adversaries disappear
 lekin bharat china nahin he, haalanki yahaan kii sarkaar apane padosi se prabhavit rahati he
 It is not just about whatsapp
 kai plateform intermediris hai, or kai baar agenciyaan bhi data kii maang karti hai
 In April, 2018, the Reserve Bank of India suddenly ordered that all data related to the payment of Indians would be stored only in India and would also have to give access to that data on demand
 gopneeyata kanoon ke bina pement data utpeeda kaa aujaar ban saktaa he
 In a controversial revelation made in 2014 against the human rights activist and outspoken critic of the government Teesta Setalvad, the Home Ministry had allegedly alleged the payment of credit card bills from foreign funds
 kaha gaya ki videshi chande se tista ne 'senitory napkin jaise nijee saamaan' kharide
 In recent years many ministries, agencies and regulators have demanded the location, access and control of their citizens' data
 or bharat main gopneeyata kanoon se kisi prakaar kii suraksha kii vyavastha tak nahin he
 Despite a landmark ruling by the Supreme Court in 2017, two years ago, privacy has not become law
 ek das-sadasyeey samiti ne july, 2018 main gopneeyata vidheyak kaa ek masauda pesh kiya
 This bill can be introduced in Parliament in the next session, but this thing has been heard since a year
 gopneeyata samiti kii report kaa sheershak 'e free and fere digital iconomi' he—gopneeyata kaa ullekh to keval duusari pankti main tha
 The proposed secrecy bill allows the government to give wide relaxation to data collection and its processing and to monitor it on a large scale
 par grih mantralay ne sarkari agenciyon ko or adhik adhikaar dene ke liye dabaav banaaya
 So when we have a privacy law, there will be a lot of leeway for government agencies
 usamen yah prastaav bhi he ki sabhi 'samvedansheel vyaktigat data' or password bharat main hi store kiye jaaen
 Think, passwords of your Gmail, Facebook or web hosting service should be stored in India and the government can see it whenever it wants? (actually, passwords are not 'stored' anywhere
 )data sarkari agenciyon ke liye sulabh bhi ho jaaen to logon ke liye khatra bad jayega
 If Gmail is forced to store emails of Indians in India, then under Section 91 of CRPC, a police station in-charge will also acquire it
 internet networkon kaa ek vaishvik network he, jise koi bhi kahin se acces kar saktaa he
 We are now building a new-age nationalist Internet bound within the confines of boundaries
 yah kahaan rukegaa?uttar pradesh main? ek report ke anusaar, uttar pradesh sarkaar chaahati he ki fasebuk, amejan, twitor, whatsap, flipcart or aisi hi anya sansthaaen uttar pradesh ke logon kaa data noida ke data kendron main store karen kyonki pradesh 'apane nagarikon ke data kii raksha' karne vaala pehla bhartiya rajya bananaa chahta he
 That is, the UP police and the Yogi government want to make their access to this data easy
 or phir isse garib or kam sakshar logon ke liye jokhim paidaa hoga
 The Modi government's high-priority policy of digital payments rather than cash may strike black money, but it has opened up new scams to potential scams, tricksters and losers
 phir, aadhaar ne bhi kai tarah kii chintaaon ko janm diya he
 Data leaks, according to UIDAI, do private, anti-social elements
 lekin database ke saath police yaa sarkari agency kisi gaanv kaa naam darj karte hi us gaanv ke musalamaanon yaa sikh bashindon kii puri list praapt kar sakati he
 Your faith is a private matter, but we have no privacy law
 hamane kanoon banaaya to bhi sarkaar ko chhot mil jaaegi or kaha jayega ki aapkaa data aapkaa hi nahin he
 In February this year, the Commerce Ministry drafted a national e-commerce policy titled 'india's Data for India's Development' which says that data is a national asset and the government should control it
 lekin 'nae daur kaa tel samajhe jane vaale data' kaa zyada sambandh kaarobaar se he
 In the Economic Survey 2018-19, it was said that the data can be sold to the private sector in public interest
 rajyasabha main, sarkaar ne 8 july ko bataaya ki isane 65 karod rupye main bharat ke car panjikaran or driving license se jude database tak 87 nijee or 32 sarkari sansthaaon ko pahunch pradaan kii he
 But this is more like cumin in the camel's mouth than the benefit of data for political parties
 sahi algoridm ke saath, data loktantr ke khel main madadgaar ho saktaa he
 There is a symbol of this game — Cambridge Analytica
 is british political kansaltency form ne fasebuk or big data analytics ke jariye america chunaavon or bregsit vot ko prabhavit kiya tha
 Fake news plays a big role in India's elections, but hard data and analytics could have played a bigger role in wooing voters
 masalan, satta paksh chunaav se thik pehle sarkari yojanaon ke 22 karod labhaarthiyon tak pahunchane kaa nirnay le
 Can you imagine that there are 22 crore small dots of different colors on the giant screen, which are slowly turning saffron? Yes, in a democracy, the voter is never as insecure today
 ve ek vishalkay digital dashaboard par dikhte ek arab rangeen dots se adhik kuch nahin rah gaye hai or analytics tathaa eani algoridm kii madad se uskaa rang jab chaahe, jaisaa badla ja saktaa he
 Of pacific
 roy technology vishyon ke lekhak or policy kansaltent hai*** Just five days have passed for the New Year that Bengaluru has come into the limelight for the wrong reasons
 aamtaur par ladakiyon ke liye 'surakshit' shahar samajha jane vaala yah shahar ek sisitivi footage kii vajah se charchaa main aa gaya jisamen nae saal ke jashn ke dauraan ek ladki ke saath chhedchhad hoti dekhi ja rahi he
 Not only this, many girls have been molested in Bengularu on this occasion, which has once again raised questions on the safety and law and order of women
 aisa hi ek maamla chatali vasnic ke saath hua jiske bare main unhone ek janvari ko fasebuk par ek post likhi thi jo ab viral ho gai he
 His post has been shared 500 times in which he told how he gave a befitting reply to the miscreant
 tippaniyan On this, Chaitali also spoke to NDTV on Tuesday, in which he told how no policeman got him to help in such difficult times
 nae saal kii purv sandhya par chatali vaasanic raat ko lagbhag 1:30 baje apane daftar se ghar laut rahi thim, jaise bahut-si anya ladkiyaan lautati hai
 On the way, when Chaitali saw two men staring at her, coming in her path from the front, she did the same thing that all girls usually do - she got into a corner, so that they had to go the way
 So to receive
 vaise, jo kuch chatali ke saath pashchimi bengaluru ke indiranagar main hua, aisi hi harakat shahar ke sabase shandaar commercial ilaaka maane jane vaale emji road par bhi bahut-si ladakiyon or mahilaon ke saath hui
 Thousands of people gathered there to celebrate the New Year, and alcohol-addicted youths grabbed, teased, punched them, chased them away
 45 security camaron main ye sabhi harakatein record huin, or soshal media par jari hui footage main mahilaon ko rote or madad ke pukaarte dekha gaya
 Police has arrested four people in this case
 is bare main chatali ne NDTV se bhi mangalvaar ko baatcheet kii thi jisamen unhone bataaya tha ki kis tarah aise mushkil vakt main madad ke liye koi pulisavaala unhen nahin mila
 On New Year's Eve, Chaitali Wasnik was returning home from her office at around 1:30 pm, just as many other girls return
 raste main jab chatali ne dekha ki do purush use ghoorte hue saamne kii disha se uske raste main aa rahe hai, to usne bhi vahi kiya, jo aamtaur par sabhi ladkiyaan kiya karti hai - vah ek kone main ho gai, taaki unhen jane kaa rasta mil sake
 By the way, what happened to Chaitali in Indiranagar in western Bengaluru, a similar incident happened with many girls and women on MG Road, considered the city's most luxurious commercial area
 vahaan hazaron log nae saal kaa jashn manaane ke liye ekatra hue the, or sharaab ke nashe main dhut yuvakon ne ladakiyon ko dabocha, chhedaa, un par fabtiyaan kaseen, unka peechha kiya
 All these actions were recorded on 45 security cameras, and in the footage released on social media, the women were seen crying and calling for help
 police ne is maamle main chaar logon ko giraftaar kiya he

 The Supreme Court has asked the government to make a guideline within three weeks on spreading rumors, abuses, trolls, threats etc
 on social media
 sarkaar kii taraf se kaha gaya he ki is par kaam chal rahaa he magar samay seemaa nahin bataai ja sakati
 Supreme Court Justice Deepak Gupta raised many questions about privacy
 sawaal vaazib the lekin ek sawaal or he
 The Supreme Court gave extremely detailed orders on mob violence
 daaroga se lekar dijipi kii javabdehi tay kii thi, bheed kii hinsa nahin rukii or na hi kisi dijipi ke khilaaf koi karrwai hui
 Will political use of social media be stopped by creating guidelines? sarkaar ke hi samarthak iti cell agar juthi baaten failaaen, kisi ko trol karen to kya vaaki aap ummid karte hai ki kisi guide line se unke khilaaf karrwai ho jaaegi
 There are still enough laws but the record of action against the people of IT cell is very poor
 saansad tak trol karte hue pakade gaye hai unka kuch nahin hua kyonki unki party sarkaar main he
 Justice Deepak Gupta said that if someone put an objectionable post, there should be a way to reach it
 mananeey adaalat ke sangyaan main yah baat to hogi ki aise anek logon ke khilaaf koi thos karrwai nahin hui balki aise logon ko sarkaar ke hi bade ohadedaar pholo karte hai
 The court wants to know who is the original creator of a message
 yah pataa kiya ja saktaa he, kai baar pataa bhi hota he lekin koi karrwai nahin hoti he
 Spreading rumors, trolling someone has become the basic task of a political organization
 is samasya ko kisi aam aadmi par shift kar unhen nahin bakhsha janaa chahie agar adaalat is samasya kaa sampurna samaadhaan chaahati he to
 He should talk about the political troll of IT cell
 baharhaal ek asli khabar kii baat kar rahaa hum
 The news of a bank being counted among the top ten cooperative banks in India has taken its account holders on the road
 jaise hi khabar ai ki reserve bank ne punjab and maharashtra koparative bank ko apni nigaraanee me le liya he or aadesh diya he ki piemasi bank ke khatadharak 6 maheene main apni kul jamaa raashi kaa maatr 1000 hi nikaal sakate hai
 If you know that you can withdraw a thousand from your account in six months, then you will see Hindu Muslim Debate on TV, see Debate on Pakistan or run towards the bank branch
 vahi hua
 As soon as this news reached the people, they started running towards the branch
 unke hosh ud gaye ki kahin sara paisa dub to nahin gaya
 People broke up outside the branches of this bank in Mumbai
 mumbai, navi mumbai, thane or palghar main 81 branch hai
 People reached the bank and created a ruckus to get their money back
 kai logon ke isi bank main acount hai
 In six months, if only one thousand can be removed, thinking what will be going on them
 punjab and maharashtra koparative bank ke saat rajyon main branch hai
 It has branches in Goa, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka
 mumbai iskaa mukhyalay he
 It has more than 5 xxrep 4 0 account holders
 march 2019 tak piemasi bank main 11,600 karod jamaa tha
 People also keep money in cooperative bank because they get more interest there
 isliye byaaz dar dekhne ke saath-saath yah bhi dekh lijie ki is bank kii vaastavik sthiti kya he
 But how can this responsibility be bestowed on the common man
 aise bank jab sarkaar ke niyamon ke tahat khulte hai to sarkaar or bank kii zimmedaari banati he ve graahak ko na thage
 You are aware that if the bank is drowned or the license of the bank gets canceled, then all your money is drowned, you will get maximum amount of one lakh only
 ek lakh ke baad kaa jitna paisa he dub jayega
 Is the lowest worldwide
 agar malaysia main bank duba to khatadharak ko 60,000 hazaar dollar tak paisa milegaa
 Only 1400 dollars in India
 canada, sweetzaraland, france main 75 hazaar dollar se lekar 1 lakh dollar se adhik paisa mil jayega
 Even in the US, if the bank gets sunk, then the account retention will get two and a half million dollars, so why is it $ 1400 in India
 yani 1 lakh tak hi kyon he
 In most countries, 60 to 70 percent of the money deposited in your account is safe, but very few in India
 baharhaal mumbai ke PMC Bank kaa enpie bad gaya tha
 Due to which its profit was reduced
 kai log yah bhi sujhaate hai ki alag-alag bainkon main paisa rakhana chahie
 Till 1993, there was a rule of only getting 30,000 if the bank was sunk
 us saal ise badha kar 1 lakh kiya gaya
 It is only one lakh since 1993
 is raashi ko mudrasphiti ke hisaab se dekhen to aaj saadhe paanch lakh hona chahie magar ek lakh hi milegaa
 Well, there is nothing to worry about it
 1913 se 1955 ke bich bharat main 1489 bank fail ho gaye the lekin uske baad kai dashakon se koi commercial bank nahin duba he
 We got all this information from the report of Radhika Marvin of Hindu Business Line
 isliye ham in khataadharakon kii chintaa samajhate hai
 Till there is no firm assurance, they will feel that the money has sunk
 jinhone zyada paise rakhe honge unki kya haalat hogi
 After the Reserve Bank's order, PMC Bank will no longer be able to offer any new loan
 na hi nivesh kar sakegaa
 It has also been said that a copy of the Reserve Bank order should be sent to every account holder
 bank kii website par lagaai jaae
 The managing director of the bank assured the account holders that all the problems will be rectified before six months but what about those account holders who may need more than 1000 tomorrow
 unhen kyon chah maheene tak sazaa di ja rahi he
 Has the bank been in trouble because of the account holders
 bhale hi in khabaron ko media main jagah na mili lekin logon ko maaloom he ki unka paisa asurakshit ho gaya he
 So they had gathered outside the Andheri branch till eight o'clock at night
 ve apane ghar nahin gaye hai
 Think what will be going on 50 thousand people at this time and the media is trying to trick people by running a discussion on Pakistan

 US President Donald Trump tweeted a part of Greta's speech and took all her efforts lightly
 kaha he ki vah ek khushhaal ladki lagati he jiskaa bhavishya ujjwal he
 It is being said that Trump has just absorbed all the efforts of Greta
 germany, france, argentina, brazil or turki
 15 children including Greta have also complained against five countries in the United Nations that these five countries are violating the human rights of those children
 grata ke bhaashan ko dilchaspee ke saath suna ja rahaa he
 All of you have taken away my childish dreams from your hollow talk
 aapaki himmat kaise hui
 'no solutions or schemes according to the new figures were introduced here because these figures are inconvenient for you
 aap ab bhi itane paripakv nahin hue hai ki jaisaa he, vaisaa bataane kii himmat kar saken
 You are cheating us lekin yuva log aapke dhokhe ko samaj rahe hai
 The eyes of future generations are on you
 agar aap hamen noummid karte rahenge to ham aapako kabhi maaf nahin karege
 We will not let you go
 ham abhi ek lakeer khinch rahe hai
 The world is awake, change is coming, whether you like it or not
 ' ye sabhi grata tunbair ke shabd hai
 In her speeches, Greta is constantly challenging the rulers of the world that only talk is happening, work is getting reduced

 According to this report, there are four STP plants in Faridabad

 Faridabad has a population of 19 lakhs
 yahaan ke gharon or industry se har din 210 emeldi pani nikalataa he jabaki chaaron astipi plant kii saaf karne kii kshamta maatr 160 emeldi he
 Day on a Million Litter
 sochie agar yahaan ke astipi plant puri kshamta se kaam nahin kar rahe hai to phir yamuna kaa kya haal hoga
 This report also states that there is no sewage treatment plant in Greater Faridabad
 jabaki yahaan 50 se adhik houseing sosayadi he
 Sushil Mahapatra reviewed the largest sewage treatment plant located in Pratapgarh area of faridabad
 plant kii haalat bahut kharaab he
 When Sushil went there, the plant was closed due to power failure
 vaise bhi yah plant apni puri kshamta par kaam nahin karata he
 It is not known that this plant does not have the capability of cleaning chemicals
 vah sirf ganda saamaan roktaa he, kapade ou keechad roktaa he
 There is no plant to clean the chemicals found in water
 yahi rasayan vaala pani jab kheti main istamaal hota he to logon ke sharir ke bheetar cancer chhod jaataa he
 Our attitude on such a serious issue is so wavering
 may 2019 ke 'down tu arth' main banajot cor ne namaami gange ko lekar ek report likhi thi
 In that report, sewage treatment plant was a big challenge
 namaami gange ke tahat 68 sivej treetment plant lagane the lekin agast 2019 tak 6 plant hi puri tarah chaalu ho sakate the
 This year's Dadasaheb Phalke Award has been announced to Amitabh Bachchan
 parde par bhoomika nibhaate hue amitabh bachchan ko 50 saal ho chuke hai
 His film journey begins with Khwaja Ahmad Abbas's film 'saat Hindustani'
 50 saal ke filmi safar ko yahaan chand linon main sametanaa sahi nahin hoga
 Even at the age of 77, Amitabh is active
 puri raat shutig karte hai
 Currently, he is busy shooting for 'kaun Banega Crorepati'
 unki safal-asafal filmon kii suchi bahut lambii he
 His acting world is huge
 bahut acchhee filmon se lekar ausat or ausat se lekar bahut karaab filmon ke safar ko unhone ek sahaj yatri kii tarah puraa kiya he
 Amitabh emerged as an anti-establishment hero in the 70s but soon came out of the image
 unki maar dhaad vaali filmein aati jaati raheen lekin bich bich main ve 'kabhi-kabhi', 'bemisaal', 'silsilaa' jaisi filmon main shant swabhaav vaale hero banakar aate rahe
 Abhinabh Bachchan has different shades of acting
 'paa', 'pink', 'piku', 'chini kam', 'blike', 'bhootnath' ke amitabh ko 'anand', 'mili', 'abhimaan' or 'chupake-chupake' ke amitabh ke saath nahin dekha ja saktaa he
 The character of all of them is quite different from Amitabh of 'deewar', 'janjir' and 'muqaddar ka Sikandar', 'sharabi', 'coolie', 'mard' and 'don'
 'tufaan', 'jaadugar' or 'shahenshaah', 6bade miyaan chote miyaan', 'aaj kaa arjuna', 'ajooba', 6ganga jamuna saraswati' ke amitabh ko dekhakar unke prashansak bhi hairaan ho gaye the
 It is not right to mention 'suryavansham' here
 is film ko itani baar dikhaaya jaataa he ki dar he log unki baaki filmein na bhul jaaen
 It should not happen that the world feels that Amitabh has worked in a single film and that is 'suryavansham'
 kabhi filmein unke liye likhi jaati thim magar ab ve kisi or ke liye likhi gai film main bhi aasaani se kaam kar lete hai
 Actually if we look at the scale of work, then the example of Amitabh is very big
 ve nae nirdeshak ke saath bhi saamaanya abhinayta kii tarah kaam karte hai
 Arrive on time and act at the behest of the director
 amitabh samay ke saath ek achche abhinayta kii manind dhalate chale gaye
 Are getting molded
 pulse polio ke abhiyaan ko amitabh bachchan ne ghar ghar pahunchaa diya tha
 Bachchan's fans have their own world
 ve har ravivaar ko unke ghar ke baahar darshan ke liye jamaa ho jate hai or amitabh jab bhi apane ghar main hote hai, unhen niraash nahin karte hai
 Time is short or else the language of Amitabh Bachchan can also be written separately
 amitabh ne koun banegaa karodpati ke zarie saarvajanik spes main ek nai hindi ko sthapit kiya tha
 They seem very cautious about their language
 angrezi or hindi donon ko sammaan ke saath or puri kushalta ke saath bolte hai
 No response to Bachchan's language

 Vijay Bahadur Singh on Friday praised Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi openly in Allahabad

 Vijay Bahadur Singh said, 'whatever Narendra Modi has said about Hindus, this is the belief and conduct of Hindus
 aam hinduon kaa maananaa he ki yahi yatharth he, isliye sabko iskaa swaagat karnaa chahie
 None of the Hindus sacrifice, they have said that even if the dog gets bogged down by my car, i feel sad, they have spoken their heart and said good things
 ye aadmi hinsa ke khilaaf he, yah acchhee baat he, sabko iskaa swaagat karnaa chahie

 This smartphone was not a MIUI, but a stock Android
 dizin bhi kaaphi behtareen tha, metal dizin rakhaa gaya
 Camera is also excellent
 bharat main ye kaaphi popular hua
 However, it was not as popular as expected from the Mi A2
 ab aayaa he Mi A3 – ye smartphone Mi a siries main ab tak kaa sabase major apgrade kaha ja saktaa he
 The design of the Mi A3 is completely different, the camera module is different and the display is also different
 samanta sirf ek he or wo he stock android
 In Quick Review, we will tell you how this smartphone works and how our experience has been after using it for some time
 dizin or bild qualitifrant or rier panel par Gorilla Glass diya gaya he
 The frame is not of metal
 plastic par krom finnish he
 It looks like steel with a chrome finish, but it is clear to use that it is plastic
 aaj kal companiyaan metal frem ke bajaae aise hi experiment kar rahi hai jo acha to bilkul bhi nahin he
 The rear panel seems to be quite premium, but if you look at it carefully, especially its frame, it does not look premium
 disple main water drop style noch diya gaya he
 There are three cameras on the rear panel, one is an LED flash light
 phone ke rier bottm main Xiaomi likhaa he or ek taraf Android One kii branding di gai he
 The phone is curved from the rear and easy to hold
 dayee taraf wolum rocker kies ke saath home batan he or neeche kii taraf USB Type c jaik ke saath spikar gril diya gaya he
 This time the company has given a headphone jack and it is upwards
 front kii baat karen upar water drop style noch diya gaya he or bejal kam hai, lekin neeche kii taraf thik bejal hai
 The build quality is good and we have used the white variant, so its good thing is that the rear panel is not a fingerprint magnet
 displexiaomi Mi A3 main 6
 There is an 08 inch display
 Res – 720X1560
 The display is faded
 company ne HD+ plus disple yuj kiya he
 In this segment, now all companies need to give better display
 hairaan karne vaali baat ye he ki Mi A1, Mi A2 kii disple isse better thi
 But in previous models the company used LCD panel and this time AMOLED panel has been given, which can be called a good upgrade
 Mi A3 kii Pixel Density 300 ppi he yuj karne ke dauraan iske disple kaa feekaapan saafan najar aata he
 The screen is bright, it is colorful, the viewing angle is also good
 disple ke maamle main ye smartphone aivarej he
 Performance and software The Mi A3 has Android Pie based Android One

 Snapdrgon 660 was given in the Mi A2
 is phone ke bharat main do verients hai – top verient main 6GB ram ke saath 128GB kii internal storage he, jabaki base verient main 4GB ram ke saath 64GB kii storage di gai he
 This time the company has given an under display fingerprint scanner which is in the bottom
 under disple fingerprint scinar tej kaam karata he
 The good thing is that it has not failed even once in use till now
 top verient kaa rivyuu kiya he or is dauraan koi lag dekhne ko nahin mila
 Multi-tasking can also be done comfortably
 ap loding, ap swimming main bhi koi lag nahin he
 The phone does not hang
 hamane is smartphone main lagbhag ek ghante PUBG khelaa he
 The phone does not heat up
 maximum par agar pabaji khelenge to thodaa lag mahasoos hoga
 However, if you play PUBG in low quality, then this fast response is also tremendous
 hamane Realme 5 bhi yuj kiya he jisamen Snapdragon 665 he or yahaan bhi gaming main thodi dikkate huin khaas kar maximum settings par khilne main
 If using average
 eps, soshal media, email, videos or photography to is lihaaj se phone slo nahin hoga or na hi aap lag mahasoos karenge
 Even if you do not add headphones during gaming, the phone's speaker works well and the audio quality of the Mi A3 will definitely impress you
 software apadats aage bhi milenge, kyonki ye Android One plateform he
 Camera Mi A3 The Mi A1 is far ahead of the Mi A2 in terms of camera
 isamen teen rier camere or 32 megapixl kaa selfi camera diya gaya he
 Talking about the rear camera setup, the primary camera is 48 megapixels
 doosraa lens 8 megapixl kaa he or ek 2 megapix kaa depth sencing camera diya gaya he
 Features like LED flash, HDR, AI mode are provided
 is price range main camera acha he
 There is no problem with outdoor photography and the pictures are good clicks
 photo main ditels bhi dekhne ko miltaa he
 Portrait mode works fine if it is light, otherwise it is an average
 becoground or forground ko thik se pahchaan karne main fail ho jaataa he
 By going into the camera interface, you have to enable 48 megapixels, then you will be able to use the main camera of 48 megapixels
 camera interphes Mi a siries ke duusare smartphone kii tarah hi he Android One he to isamen google kaa native camera ap bhi yuj hota he
 Wide angle is also correct
 photo main grain nahin milte hai
 However, photos are not as good in low light
 camera main pro mod bhi he, agar photography ke shaukeen hai to ise yuj kar sakate hai
 Let me tell you that you will not be disappointed with this smartphone camera in terms of this price segment
 HDR bhi impressive he or isamen AI mod bhi diya gaya he jise or behatar kiya ja saktaa tha
 Talking about selfie, it has a 32 megapixel front camera

 Photos are clear, sharp, with detail and colorful
 rigelt main aapako tasveeron main phek colors nahin milte or ye kaaphi acchhee baat he

 You need a compact phone that can click good photos and selfies and you can buy it if you are also good at viewing
 blottware nahin chaahate hai, google kii sarvice yuj karnaa chaahate hai or aage bhi nae apadats chahie to bhi ye aapke liye badhiya he
 Why not buy --- if you are interested in a great display then don't buy it
 gaming yujar he to bhi ye us segment kaa nahin he

 This petition was dismissed today by the court
 iske pehle bilaspur ucch nyaayalay dwaara ajit jogi se anek dastavej maange gaye the
 From 1967 till now, details related to caste were sought
 iske alaava jabalpur ucch nyaayalay va anya sthanon se jogi ki jati ko lekar dastavej mangaaye gaye the

 kya aapke pati aapse paison se judi sari baaten share karte hai? kya wo paison se jude saare bade maamalon par aapaki salaah lete hai? yaa phir wo aapako paison se jude maamalon se dur hi rakhana pasand karte hai? haal hi main hue ek adhyayan ke mutabik, agar aapke pati aapako ghar ke aarthik maamalon se dur rakhte hai or aap chaahate hue bhi unase is bare main baat nahin kar paati hai to isse sirf or sirf aap donon ke bich khinchaav kii sthiti panapati he
 For this study, many women were questioned and tried to find out if their husbands involved them in financial matters
 adhyayan ke nateezon ke anusaar, aisi sthiti main patni ke andar asuraksha kii bhaavana ghar kar jaati he or agar ye sthiti lambey vakt tak bani rahati he to isse sex life bhi prabhavit hoti he
 In today's time, even when women cooperate economically, they want that nothing should be hidden from them
 adhyayan ye daawa karata he ki aarthik maamalon par pardaa daalane se vaivaahik jivan main pareshaaniyaan aa jaati hai
 Why should women be involved in economic matters? 1
 mahilaayein hameshaa chaahati hai ki unhen barabari kaa darja mili
 In such a situation, she hopes that her husband tells her all the things related to money
 2
 Women who are not aware of economic matters are always busy in manipulation because in the lack of information they never reach any right result and start ignoring other things
 3
 Many times women also feel that their husbands spend their income elsewhere and perhaps this is why they hide this thing from them
 ye shaq vaivaahik jivan kii khushiyaan chin letaa he
 4
 aaj ke samay main zyaadaatar mahilaayein kaamkaaji hai
 He knows how to handle both at home and outside
 aise main ve chaahati hai ki unka pati unase sari baaten share kare, paise se judi baaten bhi taaki wo talmail bithakar ghar chalaa saken

 a post shared by anilskapoor (@anilskapoor) on Oct 8, 2018 at 12:22am PDT The political tussle over the assembly elections in Gujarat has intensified
 jahaan ek ore bijepi gujarat main vikaas kaa daawa kar rahi he, to duusari ore congress berogari or shiksha vyavastha samet kai mudde uthaa rahi he
 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has even said that the development of BJP in Gujarat has gone mad
 vahiin, is chunaav ko lekar sabase zyada manthan yuvaaon main chal rahaa he
 Recently, there has also been a lot of anger and resentment among the youth
 hardik patel jaise yuva netaaon ubhar kar saamne aae hai
 This time it is certain that the youth will play a decisive role in the Gujarat assembly elections
 aise main ajtak ne haal hi main congress jwine karne vaale alpesh thakur, dalit netaa jignesh mevani or bijepi netaa reshma patel se baatcheet kii
 Alpesh Thakur, who runs a big campaign against liquor in Gujarat, spoke openly about joining the Congress and bjp's allegations
 is dauraan alpesh thakur ne bijepi ke un aaropon ko sire se khaarij kiya, jisamen kaha gaya ki vah (alpesh) pad ke liye congress ke haathon bik gaye
 Also read: The biggest opinion poll on gujarat-himachal elections at 7 pm had already made up its mind to enter politics
 bijepike aaropon ke sawaalon kaa jawaab dete hue alpesh ne kaha ki ham saat saal se saamaajik kaam kar rahe hai, lekin kabhi raajnneeti nahin kii
 We campaigned against alcohol and in favor of the unemployed
 kisaanon ke utthan or shiksha vyavastha ko behatar karne ke liye aawaaj uthaai
 He alleged that the education system in Gujarat has collapsed under BJP rule
 shiksha kaa vyapareekaran ho rahaa he
 Farmers are in debt and due to alcohol, people are dying in death
 is par sarkaar ne hamase baatcheet nahin kii
 The BJP has to make a purchase because of the youth movement: Alpesh Alpesh told that when we raised this issue in front of the government, then told us to join BJP first and then think
 unhone sawaal kiya ki kya sirf bijepi waalon kii hi baat sarkaar sunegi? unhone kaha ki gujarat ke andar yuvaaon, kisaanon or mahilaon kaa jis tarah se andolan chal rahaa he, uske chalate bijepi ko kharidfrokht kerani pad rahi he
 Alpesh described the bjp's allegations as baseless
 unhone kaha ki agar main bijepi main jaataa, to yah dhabba lag jaataa ki alpesh thakur paise or pad ke liye bik gaya
 We have not taken the decision to join the Congress overnight, but have been thinking for two years
 jaag chukaa he yuva, nikal chuki he bijepi kii hawah alpekhalpesh thakur ne kaha ki in muddon ko lekar hamane do sau jansabhaayen kii, janadesh maanga or soshal media par abhiyaan chalaaya
 Now the wind of BJP has passed
 gujarat kii puri yuva peedi jaag chuki he
 Alpesh said that this time neither money nor liquor will work in Gujarat
 
 
 is baar sirf gujarat kaa power chalegaa
 He said that we will overthrow the BJP from Gujarat
 vahiin, reshma patel ne alpesh kaa virodh karte hue kaha ki ye bijepi kii party ko ukhaad phenkane or jatvaad kii sarkaar laane kaa sapana dekh rahe hai
 Apart from this, on the road against farmers, laborers and youth BJP government: Jignesh Mevani, Dalit leader in Jigneshmale said that bjp's charge is baseless that only Hardik Patel, Jignesh and Alpesh Thakur are making a noise
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ke khilaaf saavarkar bahanen, kisaan, majdoor, anganwari mahilaayein, yuva or berozegaar sadak par utar chuki hai
 Jignesh has not joined Congress, but has indicated to support Congress from outside
 patrkaar rahe jignesh ne kaha ki rajya main sadak, pani or shiksha kii vyavastha badtar he
 BJP is misleading in the name of development
 unhone sawaal kiya ki aakhir piem modi par mahilaayein bagon kyon phenk rahi hai? colector offis ke saamne maance ke tukade kyon phenke gaye? aakhir itani ashaanti kyon he? These days, most people pay more attention to its camera when buying a smartphone

 In Punjab politics, the demand for former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to contest Lok Sabha elections from Amritsar on Congress ticket is increasing
 sutron ke mutabik punjab pradesh congress cameti ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko prastaav bheja he, jisamen purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko amritsar se chunaav main utaarne kii maang kii gai he

 punjab congress ke general secetry gurkirat singh kotli ne kaha ki is tarah kaa prastaav party adhyaksh rahul gandhi or kendriya netritv ko bheja gaya he

 punjab vidhansabha chunaav prachaar ke dauraan bhi jab punjab congress ne menifesto jari kiya tha tab manmohan singh ke haathon se ye menifesto jari karavaaya gaya tha
 At that time the public was given the assurance that an honest leader like Manmohan Singh could not make false promises to the public, but in reality this manifesto was a bundle of lies
 majithia ne kaha ki manmohan singh ko amritsar se chunaav maidan main utaarne kii baaten saamne aane ke baad ye saaf he ki amritsar main congress ke paas loksabhaa chunaav ladane ke liye koi cheharaa bhi nahin he
 Majithia said that if Rahul Gandhi could not handle the Congress in Uttar Pradesh, he put forward Priyanka Gandhi and now the Congress is not looking to win in Punjab, then preparations are being made to field former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 punjab main 13 loksabhaa siton par congress or captain amarinder singh badi jeet darj karnaa chaahate hai

 Because according to bjp's constitution, the election or appointment of a new party president can be done only after the organization's elections in more than fifty percent of all states across the country

 The meeting of the Working Committee of the Board of Control for Cricket in India has been postponed due to technical reasons
 dilli main shuukravaar ko bisisiai kii baithak hone vaali thi par pehle se agenda tay nahin hone ke kaaran ise sthagit kar diya gaya
 According to BCCI sources, it is necessary to give notice 7 days in advance to call a working committee meeting
 par is cese main aisa nahin hua
 At the same time, an emergency meeting of the working committee can be called 3 days before giving notice
 haalanki aaj hone vaali baithak ke liye apaat shabd kaa istemaal nahin hua tha
 In such a situation there is no recognition of this meeting
 darasal, ye saare point bisisiai ke antarim adhyaksh jagmohan daalamia ne uthaae the
 The next date for this meeting will be set soon
 baithak naa hone ke kaaran jagmohan daalamia ab bhi board ke antarim adhyaksh bane hue hai
 However, there is confusion about Srinivasan
 sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki baithak se pehle kuch board sadasyon ne shrinivasana ko meeting main naa hissaa lene kii baat kahi
 Doing so would be an insult to the court's decision
 aisi paristhiti main abhi board ko or vakt kii jarurat he or iske saath takneekee kaarnon kaa hawala dete hue aaj kii meeting ko sthagit kar diya gaya
 At the same time, BCCI can go to Supreme Court against the decision of Bombay High Court

 aise main sabaki nigahen nirdaleey vidhayak raghuraaj pratap singh urf raja bhaiya ke vot ko lekar thi
 Raja Bhaiya, meeting with CM Yogi, reached Tilak Hall to vote after noon
 unke saath nirdaleey vidhayak vinod saroj bhi saath the
 Before voting, he said that he will give his vote to the SP candidate
 iske baad unhone vot kiya or iske baad mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke saath mulaakaat kii
 His meeting with Yogi was about 20 minutes
 bijepi ummidavaar ke saath rajabta den ki raghuraaj pratap singh rajyasabha ke bijepi ummidavaar anil jain ke saath siem yogi ke saath mulaakaat karne pahunche the
 He said that his meeting with the Chief Minister was formal
 vot usee ko diya he, jisase vaada kiya tha
 This is what i tweeted
 dinar khaakar gadabad nahin kiya
 Raja Bhaiya said that there was no talk with CM Yogi Adityanath about the vote
 akhilesh ke dinar main pahunche the rajagauratlab he ki chunaav se do din pehle sapa mukhiya akhilesh yadav kii daavat main raghuraaj pratap singh pahunche the
 Since then it was believed that he would vote for SP
 unhone ye baat dinar party main bhi kahi thi, lekin matdaan ke din us samay suspence chaa gaya, jab ye khabar ai ki wo apana vot nahin karenge
 Whom will Raja spoil? Actually Raja Bhaiya has cast his vote for Samajwadi Party and cast his vote as 37th voter
 lekin ab ek ummidavaar ko jeet ke liye 36 vot hi chahie
 In such a situation, some percentage of the vote of Raghuraj Pratap Singh could go to BSP, so it was believed that he would not cast his vote
 lekin unhone baad main jaakar matdaan kiya
 He then met CM Yogi Adityanath
 unhone kise vot kiya, ye baat abhi khulkar saamne nahin aa saki he
 Mayawati and Raja Bhaiyya have had an unease that in 2002, during the BSP government in UP, Mayawati took a very aggressive stand against Raghuraj Pratap Singh
 raghuraaj ko jail bhijwane ke saath unki aapraadhik gatividhiyon ko rokane ke liye kadaa ection liya tha
 Not only this, along with sending police to his palatial house, a lot of confiscation was also done
 iske baad 2007 main bhi mayawati ne raghuraaj pratap singh ke khilaaf kadaa ruukh apanaae rakhaa
 This is the reason why Raghuraj is reluctant to vote for the BSP candidate
 bataa den ki raghuraaj ke khilaaf hatya sahit kai aapraadhik maamle darj hai
