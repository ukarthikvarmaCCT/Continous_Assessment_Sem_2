 We feel that such a strong celebration will rarely be celebrated even after winning the World Cup
 
 
 vaise, aisa jashn hairaani kii baat nahin, kyonki match hi aisa tha, jisane prashansakon kii saansen rokkar unhen nakhun kutarne par majaboor kar diya tha
 
 
 The comments lekin sabase dilachasp tathy yah he ki match ke baad hameshaa kii tarah team india ko to badhai sandeshon kaa tantaa lag hi gaya, saath hi bhartiya team ke captain mahendra singh dhoni ke liye twitorati (twitor par sakriy logon ke liye istemaal kiya jane vaala shabd) divaana hua dikhaai diya, or har duusare twit main sivaay dhoni ke kuch dikhaai hi nahin de rahaa tha
 
 
 And not just micro-blogging site Twitter, Facebook also did not appear to be crazy about Dhoni
 
 
 khayr, aisa to hona hi tha, kyonki mahendra singh dhoni ne jo kiya, vah sachmuch behad avishwasaneey tha
 
 
 Keeping calm in the midst of so much tension, relying on a novice player like Hardik Pandya for the last over, getting the bowler to explain his strategy on every ball himself, taking a forward thought before the last ball, and finally Running out fast and getting India a victory that is almost 'impossible'
 
 
 dhoni ke liye twitor or fasebuk par prashansakon ne kya-kya likh daalaa, vah padhakar ham to behad aanandit ho chuke hai, so, ab aap bhi padhie

 com / ag6ms4a5lv — engineeroholic (@engineeroholic) March 23, 2016 But the most interesting fact is that after the match, as usual, Team India got a wave of congratulatory messages, as well as Twitterati for the Indian team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (a term used for those active on Twitter)
 Looked crazy, and nothing was visible to Dhoni except in every other tweet
 
 
 or sirf micro-bloging site twitor nahin, fasebuk par bhi dhoni ke liye divaanaapan kam nazar nahin aayaa
 
 
 Well, it had to happen, because what Mahendra Singh Dhoni did was really incredible
 
 
 itane jabardast tanaav ke bich dimag ko shant rakhana, aakhri over ke liye hardik pandya jaise kadran nausikhiye khilaadi par bharosa karnaa, har gend par khud jaakar gendbaaj ko apni ranneeti samajhaana, aakhri gend se pehle hi aage kii sochakar dastaana utaar lenaa, or ant main behad tej bhaagate hue out karnaa or bharat ko lagbhag 'asambhav' ban chuki jeet dilaanaa
 
 
 We have been very happy to read what the fans wrote for Dhoni on Twitter and Facebook, so now, you can also read

 Keeping calm in the midst of so much tension, relying on a novice player like Hardik Pandya for the last over, getting the bowler to explain his strategy on every ball himself, taking a forward thought before the last ball, and finally Running out fast and getting India a victory that is almost 'impossible'
 
 
 dhoni ke liye twitor or fasebuk par prashansakon ne kya-kya likh daalaa, vah padhakar ham to behad aanandit ho chuke hai, so, ab aap bhi padhie

 gujarat kii is 'nirbhaya' kii kahani bhi behad dardanaak he
 The 24-year-old woman, who hails from Devalia village in Botad district of Gujarat, was abducted from Surat in Gujarat in July last year
 kareeb 8 mahino tak 7 aparankarta use alag-alag jagah le jaakar uske saath dushkarm karte rahe
 The police also took no concrete action to locate him
 ek saamaajik kaaryakarta ne bahut baar police ke paas guhaar lagaai tab jaakar uski gumshudagi kii report bhi darj kii gayi
 But there was no attempt to investigate which led to darkness in this woman's life
 aakhir is saal march main wo kisi tarah aparankartaaon ke changul se apni jaan bachaakar bhaag gayi
 But by then she was in a 24-week pregnancy
 jab ghar gayi to pati ne dushkarm se panape garbh ko apnaane se inkaar kar diya
 The woman first pleaded in the lower court that she should be allowed an abortion as the child was being raped by her, but the court turned down her appeal
 aakhirkaar 'nirbhaya' ne gujarat hai court main bhi guhaar lagaai kii use garbhpaat kii anumati di jaay
 The comments doctoron ne raay jataai ki chunki garbh bahut bada ho gaya he, aise main garbhpaat karwaane main nirbhaya kii jaan ko khatra ho saktaa he
 Hence, the High Court also ruled that Nirbhaya should not abort in view of her safety
 saath hi saath court ne rajya sarkaar ko bhi sakht hidaayat di he ki is mahila or uske bachche kii suraksha or zimmedaari rajya sarkaar ke hawaale he or unke bhavishya kaa khyaal rakhaa jaay
 Nirbhaya has tried to understand her husband, but her husband is not ready to adopt this child born as a result of rape
 uskaa pati kah rahaa he kii court ne aadesh diya he to wo ye aashwast zarur karegaa ki is bachche kaa janm thik thaak ho jaay lekin uske baad us bachche kaa bhavishya kya hoga iskaa faisla uske samaaj ke buzurg lenge
 In such a situation, 'nirbhaya' is very worried about the future of himself and the child
 gujarat ke botad zile ke devlia gaanv kii rahanevaali 24 varsh kii is mahila ko pichley saal july main gujarat ke surat se agava kar liya gaya tha
 For about 8 months, 7 kidnappers took her to different places and raped her
 police ne bhi use dhundne ke liye koi thos karrwai nahin kii
 a social worker pleaded with the police several times, and a report of his disappearance was also recorded
 lekin jaanch kii koi koshish nahin hui jisase is mahila kii zindagi main andhera chaa gaya
 After all, in March this year she somehow escaped the clutches of the kidnappers after saving her life
 lekin tab tak wo 24 hafte kaa garbh apane main samete hue thi
 When she went home, the husband refused to adopt the miscarried pregnancy
 mahila ne pehle nichali court main guhaar lagaai ki use garbhpaat kii anumati di jaay kyonki ye baccha uske saath hue dushkarm kii vajah se ho rahaa he, lekin court ne uski apil thukraa di
 Finally, 'nirbhaya' also pleaded in the Gujarat High Court to allow her to have an abortion
 tippaniyan Doctors expressed the opinion that since the womb has become very large, Nirbhaya's life may be threatened in getting an abortion
 lihaaza hai court ne bhi 'nirbhaya' kii suraksha ke maddenzar use garbhpaat na karne kaa faisla sunaaya
 At the same time, the court has also given strict instructions to the state government that the safety and responsibility of this woman and her child rests with the state government and their future should be taken care of
 nirbhaya ne apane pati ko samajhane kii koshish kii he, lekin uskaa pati dushkarm ke parinamswaroop paidaa ho rahe is bachche ko apnaane ko taiyaar nahin he
 Her husband is saying that if the court has given the order then he will surely assure that the birth of this child will be fine, but after that the decision of the future of that child will be taken by the elders of his society
 aise main 'nirbhaya' apane or bachche ke bhavishya ko lekar behad chintit he

 Vasundhara's visit is getting a lot of support
 is yatra kii shuruyaat udaipur anchal ke ek pramukh dharmik centre charbhuja se hui, jahaan samarthakon kaa jabardast hujum juta
 It was mostly young and women
 itnaa baari samarthan tha ki raily ke raste main gadipoon kaa jam lag gaya
 The party claims that when this journey ends in Jaipur, a bigger rally will be seen there
 is yatra kii taiyaari main raaje kii team pichley do maheenon se juty hui thi
 Its first phase will end on April 16 in tribal area Mewar
 is ilaake main bijepi ke sanghathankarta or vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa gulabchand kataaria pichley saal may main khud ek yatra rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ke samarthan se nikaalnaa chaahate the, jisaki vajah se vasundhara ne naaraaz hokar party chhod dene kii dhamkee de daali thi

 ab ve chaahate hai ki vasundhara khud ilaake main netritv karen or janata ko bataaen ki kaise gahalot ne mewar kii upeksha kii he or adivaasiyon ko milane vaale laabh unhen nahin mil sake hai
 Raje was first introduced in state politics in 2003 by Bhairon Singh Shekhawat to humiliate his opponents
 raaje achaanak lokapriy ho gai thim, jisaki vajah se party ne shekhavat ke vikalp ke taur par unhen apana liya
 By then, Shekhawat had become the Vice President of India
 shekhavat kii chaaya se khud ko ubaarte hue raaje ne 2003 main bijepi ko record 120 siten dilwaai thim
 When she was the Chief Minister, during this time, she gave reservation to the tribals of Mewar in jobs in lower posts

 Despite doing so much, the BJP did not gain much in Mewar and they were able to win only 6 seats in 2008 as against 23 out of 29 seats in 2003 and were out of power in the state
 haalanki is baar raaje aatmavishvaas se labarej hai kyonki unki reliyon main baari bheed jute rahi he
 His enthusiasm can also be seen among the party workers
 unhone is baar apni shahi chhavi ko tod diya he
 In the posters, she looks like a leader smiling and greeting the crowd, wearing a simple chiffon sari
 unki kor team bhi badal chuki he
 Rajya Sabha MP and Supreme Court advocate Bhupendra Yadav is the convenor of the team
 ve bhi unke saath bas main gum rahe hai
 Significantly, two prominent faces of the Sangh Parivar, Captain Singh Solanki and Saudan Singh, are also standing with Vasundhara in the state

 dilli main is samay wo sarkaar he jo hameshaa kahati he ki jo janata chaahegi wo hoga, agar janata kisi ilaake main sharaab kii dukaan nahin chaahegi to vahaan sharaab kii dukaan nahin rahegi
 We went out to investigate these claims of the Kejriwal government of Delhi
 sabase pehle ham dilli ke tilak nagar ke anmol vatika ilaake main gaye
 About a month ago, on January 7, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had conducted a public hearing at this place and after conducting a referendum, it was decided that the liquor shop which the common people here objected to would be closed
 lekin kareeb ek maheenaa hone ko aayaa he, sharaab kii dukaan jaise pehle khuli hui thi aaj bhi vaise hi khuli hui he
 At the time of the referendum, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal called it democracy and Swaraj and said, 'the decision you will take will be binding on the government and the government will follow that decision
 ye jo paddati kii ja rahi he dilli ke andar mujhe lagata he puure desh me pehali baar ho rahaa he ki janata se poochkar baat kii ja rahi he
 Now the liquor shop will be closed by asking the people of the area from which the complaint will come
 ' The common people of the troubled area are asking the government what happened to your promise from the liquor shop of about 10-12 years old
 anmol vatika nivasee avadhesh gupta ne bataaya ki 'ek maheenaa pehle jo kejariwal ji air sisodiya ke saath yahaan meeting hui thi us samay main gaya tha

 Anmol Vatika RWA Secretary VK Sharma said, 'the meeting was held, he promised that the contract would be closed
 to abhi tak to hamako kuch pataa nahin chalaa ki kya isapar karrwai hui?' ilaake kii mahilaayein sharaabiyon se pareshaan hai
 Shobha Gupta, who lives in Anmol Vatika, said, 'people stand drunk after drinking alcohol at the main entrance
 guard ko bhi maarthe hai
 They refuse to drink alcohol here but they do not listen to anyone
 ham kehete hai to hamako kehete hai ki aapako kya problem ho rahi he
 Hey, we are speaking when the problem is happening
 ' ilaake ke log soch rahe hai ki is maamle ke liye mukhyamantri se bada to koi he nahin
 When the liquor store is not closed due to his saying, now plead with the PM? After that we reached Shiv Vihar Tirahe in Karawal Nagar, North East Delhi
 shiv vihaar tirahe par kareeb 30-32 saal purana hanuman mandir he
 There is a liquor store only 60-70 meters from the temple
 log saalon se is sharaab kii dukaan kii shikaayat kar rahe hai
 Their public hearing is also being done, but this liquor shop has been going on like this for years
 ilaake ke logon ne bataaya ki is sharaab ke theke se public itani pareshaan he ki 7 baje ke baad auraton or bacchon kaa yahaan se nikalnaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 Get drunk and get drunk here

 It is said that it has become difficult for women to leave the house
 saalon se shikaayat kar rahe hai, koi sunata hi nahin
 Girish Kumar said that Kejriwal ji said that if the common man wants, the contract will go away
 yahaan to saare aadmi chaahate hai, sari auraten chaahati hai
 The chairperson of the Women's Commission had also come, women also complained to them but nothing happened
 theka badastoor jari he
 In July 2017, Swati Maliwal Jaihind, chairperson of the Delhi Women's Commission, conducted a public hearing here and measured the distance from the temple to the liquor store, which turned out to be about 60 meters
 or dilli sarkaar ko ye dukaan band karwaane ko kaha
 Hearing the answer given by the Delhi government, you will be shocked
 dilli sarkaar ne kaha ki kanoon ke mutabik 400 squaire fit aria vaale mandir ke daayre main theka nahin ho saktaa
 This Hanuman temple is spread in about 258 square feet, so the contract law is correct
 sochie ye us sarkaar ke exise department kaa jawaab he jiskaa daawa he ki janata jo chaahegi sarkaar vahi karegi
 No matter what happens, if people do not want a liquor shop, then there cannot be a shop in the area

 People of the area said that the public is so upset with this liquor contract that it becomes difficult for women and children to leave from here after 7 pm

 Come in the evening, you will find 10-15 drunkards right here

 4 people stand with one and while coming, girls have to speak upright, everything is very troublesome
 girish kumaar beete 22 saal se yahaan rahete hai

 july 2017 main dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksha swati maliwal jaihind ne yahaan jansunwaayee karke mandir se sharaab kii dukaan kii duuri napawai jo kareeb 60 meter nikali
 And asked the Delhi government to close this shop
 dilli sarkaar ne jo jawaab diya wo sunakar aapke hosh ud jaaenge
 The Delhi government said that according to the law, a contract with a temple with 400 square feet area cannot be contracted
 ye hanuman mandir kareeb 258 squaire fit main failaa he isliye theka kanuunan sahi he
 Think this is the response of the excise department of the government which claims that the government will do whatever the public wants
 chaahe kuch bhi ho jaay, agar log sharaab kii dukaan nahin chaahate to ilaake main dukaan nahin ho sakati
 The comments iske baad ham purvi dilli ke mayur vihaar phej 3 main ek bade or nami skool pahunche
 The liquor store has been running right in front of this school for years
 ye sharaab kii dukaan saalon se parents kii chintaa kaa sabab bani hui he lekin skool ke baahar mili parents ne bataaya ki saalon se is sharaab kii dukaan kii shikaayat kar rahe hai ki isse hamaare bacchon kii suraksha khatre main pad sakati he yaa ye sharaab dukaan maahaul bigaad rahi he, lekin koi karrwai nahin hui
 In September last year, when a 7-year-old child was killed in a large school in Gurugram, a liquor store was also found near him
 isse sabak lete hue dilli ke upmukhyamantri or shiksha mantri manish sisodiya ne elaan kiya ki dilli main skulon ke aasapaas maahaul kharaab kar rahi sharaab dukaanon kii jaankaree sabhi skulon se maangi he
 Despite the regulations, if a liquor shop is disturbing the environment around a school, then it will be closed
 lekin 5 maheene hone ko aaye, sab vaisaa hi chalata dikh rahaa he
 In such a situation, why a Delhi government hoarding has been placed outside the Delhi Secretariat i

 com / 1cobil4fpvsamajavaxi party ke emelsi raajapaal kashyap ne kaha ki mukhyamantri, mantri, sabhi hanumanji kii jati bataane main lage hue hai
 The Chief Minister calls Hanuman a Dalit and one of his ministers calls Jat

 Bukkal Nawab said, 'hanuman ji was a Muslim according to us
 isaliye musalamaanon main jo naam rakhe jate hai yani rahamaan, phurkan, jishaan, armaan vagairah jitne bhi naam hai, aise kam se kam 100 naam hai, jo hanuman ji par hi milenge
 That is why we understand that Hanuman ji was a Muslim
 'unhone daleel di ki hindu samudaay main hanuman ke baaki naam nahin milenge
 Hindu brothers can name Hanuman but they cannot keep Sultan, Armaan, Rahman
 ye hanuman ji se milte-julate naam hai
 There has been a lot of political rhetoric about Lord Hanuman's caste recently, but this first statement has come about his religion
 bataa den ki isse pehle upi ke mukhyamantri nehanuman ji ko dalit bataaya tha

 desh ke paanch rajyon main hue vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey 11 disambar ko aaenge, lekin usase pehle shuukravaar ko aae eczit pole main bijepi ke liye achche sanket nahin hai
 The BJP, which is in power in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, seems to be bidding farewell
 jabaki congress purnabahumat ke saath satta ke singhaasana par vaapasi karti dikh rahi he
 In such a situation, if the Exit Polls turn into election results, then who will bear the brunt of defeat in BJP ruled states? It is but natural for the BJP to develop uneasiness over this question
 'modi se bair nahin vasundhara teri khayr nahin'india today-exis maai india agsit pole ke mutabik rajasthan main bijepi ko karaari maat milti dikh rahi he
 Of the total 200 assembly seats in the state, 119 to 141 seats are seen in the account of Congress
 mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke netritv main bijepi ko 55 se 72 siten mil sakati hai
 Not only this, bjp's defeat is also seen in the remaining exit polls
 jabaki 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko 163 siten hasil hui thim
 In such a situation, the question arises that if the exit poll changes in the results, then the head of bjp's defeat in Rajasthan will be blown
 mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje kii jimmedaari hogi yaa phir party ke aalaa netaa kii
 However, slogans of 'don't hate Modi, Vasundhara Teri Khair Nahin' were being raised in the state
 isi ke chalate rajasthan main vasundhara raaje ko jeet dilaane ke liye piem modi ne 13 reliyaan kii hai, amit shah ne pradesh ke sabhi jilon kaa daura kiya or 38 kaarykram kiye
 Vasundhara Raje also performed 75 rallies
 party ke duusare netaaon ne kul 222 reliyaan or 15 road sho kiye
 Despite this, the BJP appears to be defeated in the exit poll
 aisi surat main bijepi ko jeet milti to nishchit rup se jeet kaa shrey piem modi or party ke aalaa netaaon kii diya jaataa, lekin haar ke liye jimmedaari kiski hogi, ye ahm sawaal he
 Chhattisgarh's farewellindia today-axis My India exit poll in Chhattisgarh, BJP, which has been in power for 15 years, seems to be getting beaten up
 rajya kii 90 sadasyeey vidhansabha main congress ko 55 se 65 siten or bijepi ko 21 se 31 siton ke bich hi santosh karnaa pad saktaa he
 While others are likely to get 4 to 8 seats
 pole ke mutabik mukhyamantri raman singh kii satta se vidaai tay he
 Exit Polls in Chhattisgarh turn into results, then who will be responsible for the defeat
 mukhyamantri raman singh ke khilaaf na to rajasthan jaisi sattavirohi lahar thi or na hi party main kisi tarah kaa bagawati sur tha
 Despite this, the exit poll seems to be losing
 to aise main phir haar kii jimmedaari kiski hogi
 While many party leaders including PM Modi and Amit Shah have held several rallies
 madhya pradesh main mamaa shivaraj kii raah mushkilmadhya pradesh kii satta main 15 saal se kabiz bijepi kaa durg darakta najar aa rahaa he
 According to India today-axis My India exit poll, there is a close fight between Congress and BJP in the state
 lekin congress maamuli badhat ke saath aage he
 According to the poll, BJP is expected to get 102 to 120 seats and Congress 104 to 122 seats in the 230-member assembly
 jabaki basapa ko 3 or anya ko 3 se 8 siten milane kaa anumaan he
 It is worth mentioning that in the 2013 elections, BJP got 165 seats and Congress 58 seats
 madhya pradesh main shivaraj singh chouhan pichley 13 saal se mukhyamantri hai
 There was no significant anti-incumbency against Shivraj nor any challenge in the party
 modi ne bhi apni chunavi reliyon main shivaraj ke kaamkaaj kii jamkar tarif kii thi
 Despite this, in the exit poll, the Congress is ahead of the BJP in the MP
 nattejey aise hi rahe to phir jimmedaari kiski hogi
 The question of the responsibility of defeat before 2019, in fact, the assembly elections of five states are being considered as semifiles of 2019
 aise main bijepi shasit teenon rajya uske haath se nikalate hai, to iskaa asar loksabhaa chunaav main bhi padegaa
 In such a situation, the top leaders of the BJP will never want the responsibility of defeat to behead the national leadership or Narendra Modi
 is surat main teenon mukhyamantri ko apane sir haar kaa 'sehara' baandhna pad saktaa he
 Custodian Ramvaran Singh was also badly injured in the incident
 is ghatana ne jahaan apane kaam ke prati nishthavan vyaktiyon kii chhavi ko ujagar kiya he vahiin dilli kii suraksha vyavastha par sawalia nishaan khadey kiye hai

 The SP government has acted and they will get the mandate

 It has 650 branches and 3250 access points across the country, where parallel launch programs were held
 is dauranpiem modinecongresspar jamkar hamalaa bolaa or kai muddon par apni baat rakhi
 Launching the IPPB, PM Modi said that 1 September 2018 will be remembered as the beginning of an unprecedented feature in the history of the country
 iske saath hi deshbhar main sabhi 1
 55 lakh post offices will be connected to the IPPB system by 31 December 2018
 padhie piem modi ke bhaashan kii 10 badi baaten
 
 
 1
 aazaadee ke baad se lekar saal 2008 tak desh ke bainkon ne 18 lakh karod rupee kii raashi hi lone ke taur par di thi
 But in the six years after 2008, this amount increased to Rs 52 lakh crore, that is, twice the loan that banks had given after independence, in the six years of the previous government
 2
 The spread of phone banking in our country was not so much at that time, but the Namdars started banking on phones and getting loans on phones
 jis bhi bade udyogpati ko lone chahie hota tha, wo namadaaron se bank ko phone karvaa detaa tha
 The bankers then used to give a loan of crores of rupees instantly to the person or his company
 congress or uske namadaaron kii phone banking ne desh ko bahut nuksaan pahunchaaya
 3
 bainkon ne ye jaanate hue ki unke dwaara die gaye lone kii vaapasi mushkil hogi, lekin ek parivaar ke order ke baad vishesh logon ko lone diya
 Not only this, when such people started defaulting, the banks were forced to get new loans
 ye gorakhdhandha lone kii ristraccharing ke naam par hua
 4
 12 bade difolter, jinako saal 2014 ke pehle lone diya tha, jiske NPA kii raashi kareeb paune do lakh karod rupee hai, unke khilaaf karrwai shuru ho gai or uske nattejey aaj dikh bhi rahe hai
 Similarly there are 27 more large loan accounts, which have an NPA of one lakh crore
 isaki vaapasi kaa bhi intjaam kiya ja rahaa he
 Those who felt that with the participation and kindness of the Namdar family, millions and crores of rupees will be with them forever, will always remain incoming, now outgoing has also started from their account
 5
 The NDA government itself brought the truth of the NPA, this scandal of the previous government to the country
 hamane keval beemaari kaa pataa hi nahin lagaaya, balki uske kaaran bhi talaashe or us beemaari ko durust karne ke liye kadam bhi uthaae hai
 All loans above 50 crore have been reviewed in the last four years
 lone kii sharton kaa kadai se paalan ho, ye sunishchit kiya ja rahaa he
 We changed the law, decided the merger of banks and promoted professional approach in the banking sector
 6
 The Congress has sat on the economy of the country at Eklandmine
 usee samay desh or duniya ke saamne isaki sachai rakh di jaati, to aisa visphot hota kiarthvyavasthasanbhal nahin paati
 The country was pulled out of this crisis with great precaution
 india post pement bank desh ke arthtantr or saamaajik vyavastha main ek bada parivartan karne ja rahaa he
 Our government has first reached the bank for crores of poor families through Jan Dhan and from today the work of sending the bank to the doorstep of the village and the poor has started
 7
 Those who were involved in the fraud of banking frauds also knew very well that one day they would be exposed
 isliye usee samay se herapheri kii ek or sajeesh saath-saath rachi gai
 The exact figures of how much loan given by banks could not be returned, started to be hidden from the country
 saal 2014 main jab hamaari sarkaar bani to sari sachai saamne aane lagi, tab bainkon se kadai se kaha gaya ki sahi-sahi akalan karen ki unki kitni raashi is tarah kaa lone dene kii vajah se funs gai he
 8
 hamaari sarkaar desh ke bainkon ko garib ke daravaaje par lekar aa gai he
 Otherwise, four-five years ago, such a situation was created that most of the money of the banks was reserved for only those rich people, who were close to a particular family
 9
 After the launch of IPPB, the postman has now become a mobile bank
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar par logon kaa vishwaas beshak dagamagaaya ho, lekin daakiya ke prati kabhi nahin dagamagaaya
 The thieves and bandits did not even bother the first postman
 IPPB kisaanon ke liye bhi ek badi suvidha sabit hoga
 This will give special emphasis to schemes like Prime Minister Crop Insurance
 post pement bank ke baad ab yojanaon kii clem raashi bhi ghar baithe hi mila karegi

 himachal pradesh or gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ke rujhaanon membijapi ko saaf badhatamili he
 In Himachal Pradesh, BJP has secured a clear majority, but bjp's CM candidate Prem Kumar Dhumal is seen emerging from the cm's chair
 sujanpur seat par bijepi ke siem pad ke ummidavaar prem kumaar dhumal congress ke ummidavaar rajindar singh se haar gaye hai
 After the defeat of Prem Kumar Dhumal, the face of the former Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh and BJP Chief Minister, speculation has started about the new Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh
 mukhyamantri kii daud main jin logon ke naam aa rahe hai, unamem sabase pehle jai ram thakur kaa naam he
 Jai Ram has also been a former minister and former Himachal BJP president
 unhen aaj hi dilli bula bhi liya gaya he or duusari taraf aresas ke prachaarak ajay jamwaal, jo kii mandi ilaake se hi aate hai
 His name is also being taken in the probables of the Chief Minister
 dhumal kii haar or siem ke naam par bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha ki ham logon kii bhaavana kaa sammaan karte hai
 The decision will be taken at the party's board meeting today
 vahiin haar ke baad prem kumaar dhumal ne kaha ki unki vyaktigat haar myne nahin rakhti he, party kii jeet zyada mahatvapurn jeet he
 Dhumal said that winning defeat is part of life
 himachal pradesh kii sabhi 68 vidhansabha siton ke rujhaanon main tasviir lagbhag saaf ho chuki he or rajya main bijepi kii sarkaar ban rahi he
 Former Himachal Pradesh CM Prem Kumar Dhumal has lost the Sujanpur seat
 aise memprem kumaar dhumalsujanpur seat par hui haar se ab bijepi ko siem pad ke liye koi doosraa naam laana hoga
 Although the BJP may have won in Himachal Pradesh, the veterans have suffered defeat
 bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh or teen baar se vidhayak satpal singh satti bhi oona seat se chunaav haar gaye hai
 Congress candidate Satpal Singh Raizada defeated him by 3196 votes
 nadda banenge mukhyamantri?agar prem kumaar dhumal kii haar ke baad kendriya swasthya mantri jagat prakaash nadda bijepi kii duusari pasand ban sakate hai
 Nadda was seen as the choice of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Himachal Pradesh Assembly elections
 lekin ain vakt par prem kumaar dhumal ko siem pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya gaya
 The JP Nadda camp was the biggest setback to Dhumal's announcement

 tumne chote bhai kii bhi dekhbhaal kii, use meri kami mahasoos nahin hone di
 i have implemented this in office too
 yuvaaon ko badi jimmedaari detii hum
 i believe in luck but hard work is also necessary
 har vyakti apni kismat khud likhata he
 Take your luck in your hands, dream of what you want to achieve and write it according to yourself
 main chaahati hum ki jindagi main aage badhate hue tum ek ek karke safalataa kii seedhi par kadam rakho
 Desire the sky but move slowly towards it, enjoy every step of your journey
 yah chote chote kadam hi safar ko puraa banaate hai
 The comments yaad rakhana achche or bure pal tumhaari jindagi main barabari se shaamil honge or tumhen donon kaa barabari se saamana karnaa aana chahie
 Take full advantage of every opportunity you get in life and learn something from every opportunity, every challenge
 -tumhaari maa i am very proud to see you standing as a confident woman on the threshold of an exciting journey in life
 main tumhen aage ke saalon main tarakkee or bulandiyaan choote hue dekhnaa chaahati hum
 Seeing this moment, i remembered my journey and the lessons taught in life
 jab main un dinon ko yaad karti hum to mujhe ehsaas hota he ki zyaadaatar baaten maine apane bachapan main hi sikh lee thi, khaastaur par apane mata-pita ke jariye
 The rites that he gave me in childhood, are working as a foundation in the way i live my current life
 mata-pita ne ham do bahanon or bhai ko hameshaa barabari se bada kiya
 My grandparents used to give a lesson to the three of us - it is important to pay attention to what we get satisfaction from and we should earnestly pursue it
 is sikh ne hamen bahut jald hi apane faisle lene ke liye aatmanirbhar bana diya tha
 i was just 13 when my father died of a sudden heart attack
 ek hi din main sabakuch badal gaya
 The responsibility of handling the three children went to the mother
 tab hamen ehsaas hua ki vah kitni majboot hai
 She learned textile designing and started working in a small company
 parivaar ko akele chalaanaa nishchay hi unke liye mushkil rahaa hoga, lekin unhone hamen is baat kaa kabhi ehsaas nahin hone diya
 She kept working until we became self-sufficient
 main nahin jaanati thi ki meri maa ko apane aap par itnaa bharosa he
 It is important for a working mother not to let her work affect the family
 tumhen yaad he jab mere emdi or siio banane kii ghoshnaa hui? tab tum america main pard rahi thi
 You sent me the mail likhaa tha, 'tumne kabhi mahasoos nahin hone diya ki tumhaara karier itnaa demanding or tanaav se bharaa he
 You are just a mother at home
 ' tum bhi apni jindagi isi tarah jeena
 i learned from my mother how important it is to deal with difficult situations and move forward
 chunautiyon se nipatakar or majboot bano, unhen khud par haaavee mat hone do
 i remember how ICICI was threatening the existence of the bank after the 2008 global crisis
 tab maine bank main paise jamaa karne waalon, niveshkon, sarkaar or regulators sabase baat kii thi
 He told that very little money is in trouble
 staff se kaha ki agar koi dipositor paise nikaalane aae to usase narmi se baat karen, unhen bithaaen, pani pilaaein
 Explain to them that you can withdraw money whenever you want, but the bank is not in trouble
 unheen dinon tumhaare bhai kaa squash toornament tha
 i was there for about two hours
 baad main pataa chalaa ki mere vahaan jane se bank ke prati graahakon kaa bharosa badha
 Many women who came to the tournament asked me if i am Chanda Kochhar of ICICI Bank? i said yes
 tab unhen laga ki agar is sankat kii ghadi main bhi main toornament ke liye samay nikaal sakati hum to iskaa matlab he ki bank surakshit haathon main he
 i used to give time to mother and mother-in-law with office
 badale main unhone bhi pyaar or samarthan diya
 Remember, relationships are important
 unka khyaal rakhana jaruri he
 Treat anyone you expect from them
 mere ghar se baahar rahane par tumhaare pita ne kabhi shikaayat nahin kii varna meraa kariyar aage nahin badhata
 We were both busy in our careers, yet we took full care of our relationship
 mujhe vishwaas he ki jarurat padane par tum bhi apane jivan saathi ke saath vaisaa hi karogi
 i remember when you were going to have board exams
 maine chuttee lee taaki tumhen pariksha haul tak le ja sakuun
 But you said that for so many years you have become accustomed to taking the exam alone
 yah sunakar mujhe thes-si lagi
 Then i was relieved to think that because of my work, you have become self-sufficient at an early age

 -tumhaari maa -your mother kashmir main teji se badalte ghatnakram ke bich aaj (somvaar) dilli main kendriya cabinet kii baithak hogi
 This meeting took place at 9 in the morning
 30 baje pradhanmantri awaas par hogi
 The agenda of the meeting has been kept completely top secret and will be brought directly to the cabinet
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki cabinet baithak main kashmir ko lekar koi bada faisla ho saktaa he
 These speculations are also getting wind up because till now the government and army were claiming to break the back of terrorism, in such a situation, people behind the cancellation of Amarnath Yatra and the decree of outsiders leaving Kashmir on the basis of getting some weapons
 Looking for big reasons
 yahi nahin, ye bhi sanket die ja rahe the ki november ke aasapaas kashmir main chunaav honge
 In such a situation, the question is that when the Amarnath Yatra cannot take place, how will the elections be held? On Sunday, before the cabinet meeting, Union Home Minister Amit Shah chaired a high-level security meeting
 baithak main rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal, grih sachiv rajeev gauba, khufia beuro (ibi) ke pramukh arvind kumaar, research and analysis wing (ro) ke pramukh samant kumaar goyal or grih mantralay ke varisht adhikariyon ne hissaa liya
 The meeting of Kashmiri leaders was also held in Kashmir since the way the movement has increased in the last few days
 ravivaar ko neshnal conference ke netaa or jammu kashmir ke purv mukhyamantri faruk abdulla ke awaas par ek sarvadaleey baithak hui
 Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) President Mehbooba Mufti also attended the meeting
 yah baithak jammu kashmir ke maujuuda halaat par kendrit thi jisamen vishesh rajya ke darje par charchaa kii gai
 After the meeting, Farooq Abdullah said that special status of Jammu and Kashmir should not be taken away under any circumstances
 unhone kaha ki ham hindustan ke raashtrapati or pradhanmantri se apil karte hai ki aisa koi kadam na uthaaya jaae jisase ghati ke aman chaiyn main khalal pade
 He said that there is a fear in the people of the deployment of the army in Jammu and Kashmir and it has never happened that the Amarnath Yatra has been canceled
 baithak se pehle mahabuuba mufti or umr abdulla najarbandudhar aaj honi vaali cabinet baithak se kuch der pehle ravivaar raat ko jammu kashmir ke do bade netaaon ko najarband kar diya gaya
 PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti and NC leader Omar Abdullah were placed under house arrest in Srinagar
 lagaataar ho rahi karrwai se bhi in atakalon ko bal mil rahaa he ki aaj kii baithak main sarkaar kashmir ko lekar faisla le sakati he
 In Delhi, two bike riders bump into a woman with the intention of snatching chains
 mahila se takaraane ke baad vah uski sone kii chen todane main kaamyaab bhi ho jate hai lekin vah nahin jaanate the ki unka muqabla ek siaisef consteble ke saath hua he
 Eventually the miscreants realized their goodness by leaving the bike and running away from there
 maamla east dilli ke south ganesh nagar ilaake kaa he
 CISF constable Premlata Kumari (26 years) left home to Ghaziabad at around 8 pm on Thursday night
 kuch dur pahunchate hi do bike savaar badmaash vahaan pahunchate hai or premalata ko takkar markar gira dete hai
 Before Premlata could understand anything, the miscreants start running away with a string of casseroles around their throats
 haath or chehre par chot lagane ke baavjood premalata badmaashon kaa virodh karti he
 The crooks get off the bike and scramble with him
 premalata bhi badmaashon kaa puraa muqabla karti he

 Indian Mujahideen is plotting big terror blasts in India, the arrested terrorist Yasin Bhatkal has revealed this
 bhatkal ke mutabik bharat main chhipe indian mujahiddeen ke aatankiyon ke paas itnaa visphotak he ki wo darjanon dhamaake kar sakate hai
 This revelation of Bhatkal has given sleep to intelligence agencies
 bhatkal indian mujahidin ke bade cmanderon main se ek he
 It has been more than a week since Bhatkal was captured, but whatever revelations are being carried out by the intelligence agencies Yasin Bhatkal's words are going to shake

 After this disclosure of terrorist Yasin Bhatkal, intelligence agencies have lost sleep, because if Bhatkal is telling the truth, then it is necessary to stop the conspiracy of this destruction of terrorists as soon as possible
 khufia agenciyon ke sutron ke mutabik bhatkal ne ye bhi mana he ki jab riyaj or ikbaal bhatkal desh chhod bhaage, uske baad hi indian mujahiddeen kii kaman uske saath main ai thi
 This means that the Indian Mujahideen network in India was running Bhatkal, so now intelligence agencies are collecting all the information as well as the entire network of Indian Mujahideen from Bhatkal
 IM kaa naam to plan ISI kaa
 
 
 Bhatkal has revealed that the ISI created a project 'karachi' to create havoc in India
 or isi project ke liye iem ko miltaa tha iesai se paisa

 aatanki yaccin bhatkal ke mutabik, indian mujahidin yani iem puri tarah se iesai ke ishaare par kaam karata tha
 Yasin Bhatkal has said that the ISI created the 'karachi' project in 2003 to create an environment of panic and destruction in India and five years later in 2008, the Indian Mujahideen was given the responsibility to carry out the project in India
 kya he project 'karachi' kaa makasad?aatanki yaccin bhatkal ne jo khufia agenciyon ko bataaya he, uske mutabik karachi project kaa makasad bharat sarkaar ko asthir karnaa, logon main dar paidaa karnaa or jagah-jagah aatanki hamalon ko anjaam dena tha
 According to Yasin Bhatkal, the ISI used to pay all the money to run the Indian Mujahideen
 IM ko ISI kiya karata he fundingatanki yaccin bhatkal ne bataaya he ki iesai project karachi ko shuru se hi funding karata rahaa he

 kisaanon kii samasyaayein samajhane nikle congress upaadhyaksharahul gandhi kaa punjab daurakitna asardaar rahaa, yah to vakt batayega
 But in this one day, apart from talking to farmers, we tell you what happened
 rahul mangalvaar kotrain kii general bogi main baithkembala pahunche the
 From here he reached Govindgarh and Khanna Mandi and interacted with the farmers
 raat main unhone sarhind kii cheema havela par dinar kiya
 He ate lady's finger, yellow lentils, aloo bhaji, papad and tandoori roti
 saath main thi diggaj netaaon kii faujasutron ke mutabik, tay yah hua tha ki rahulapunjab main kisi kisaan ke ghar par rukenge
 But Rahul's warlords could not find a farmer's house for him
 rahul ke saath is dauraan diggaj congressiyon kii acchhee-khaasi taadaad thi
 These included Ambika Soni, Shakeel Ahmed, Harish Chaudhary, Jyotiraditya Scindia
 vahiin punjab ke netaaon main kulajit nagara, parminder pinki, rajender cor bhattal, sunil jakhad, ravanit bittu, vijayendra singla or brahm mohindra shaamil the
 No room was found in the guest house
 When no farmer's house was found as a hideout, Rahul returned to Chandigarh and started searching for a room in the UT guest house here
 lekin yahaan ek conference ke mehmaanon ke liye pehle se hi kamare book the
 After this, Rahul left towards Himachal Bhavan of Sector-28
 bataaya jaataa he ki unhone vahiin raat guzari
 
 
 
 or jab guard 'bhaiya' bhi chaunk gayehimachal bhawan ke baahar khadaa security guard us vakt chaunk gaya jab apni SUV se utarane ke baad rahul ne apane khaas andaaj main uskaa haal-chaal poocha
 When Rahul told him that he was alright, he remembered his old speeches
 khayr, bataaya ja rahaa he ki rahul ko subah 6:50 baje kii shatabdi lekar dilli aana tha
 If we had gone by train, there was a plan to return by train itself
 lekin kinhin vajahon se vah train na le sake
 Now reaching the capital with an 8:05 am flight
 shen watasan ek joardaar olerounder rahe hai lekin test cricket main ve apni puri kshamta ke mutabik pradarshan nahin kar paae
 Looking at his performance with the bat in Tests, he scored the last century in the 2013 Ashes series in Month Test
 paanch test maichon kii us siries main watasan ne 345 ran banaae the
 After this series, Australia took part in the Test series against India, South Africa, West Indies and England but Watson did not succeed
 agar gendbaaji ke lihaaj se dekhen to 59 test maichon main 75 wicket kaa record bahut aakarshak to nahin kaha ja saktaa
 In these matches, Watson took five wickets in the innings just three times
 unke kariyar kaa sabase behtareen pradarshan pakistan ke khilaaf pari main chah wicket tha, wo bhi 2010 main
 Apart from this, Watson was also injured due to his heavy height
 yahi vajah he ki 11 saal ke apane test kariyar main watasan australia kii ore se mahaj aadhe test maichon main hissaa le paae
 However, a big problem with Watson was that he could not rectify his mistakes
 wicket ke saamne pagabaadha out hona rahaa ho yaa phir set hone ko baad laaparvaahee main wicket ganvaana, watasan isamen sudhaar kar pate unke aakade kahin zyada damdaar hote
 The comments ab watasan kii umr bhi 34 saal kii ho chuki he, aise main test se sanyas kaa unhone bilkul sahi faisla liya he
 Under the leadership of Steven Smith, the team now needs fresh faces
 iske alaava michel marsh jaisaa joardaar olerounder shen watasan kii jagah lene ko bilkul taiyaar ho chukaa he
 In such a situation, the Australian team will not miss Watson
 vahiin duusari ore dabaav kam hone se watasan vanade or tii-20 cricket main kuch joardaar pradarshan jarur kar paaenge
 Looking at his performance with the bat in Tests, he scored the last century in the 2013 Ashes series in Month Test
 paanch test maichon kii us siries main watasan ne 345 ran banaae the
 After this series, Australia took part in the Test series against India, South Africa, West Indies and England but Watson did not succeed
 agar gendbaaji ke lihaaj se dekhen to 59 test maichon main 75 wicket kaa record bahut aakarshak to nahin kaha ja saktaa
 In these matches, Watson took five wickets in the innings just three times
 unke kariyar kaa sabase behtareen pradarshan pakistan ke khilaaf pari main chah wicket tha, wo bhi 2010 main
 Apart from this, Watson was also injured due to his heavy height
 yahi vajah he ki 11 saal ke apane test kariyar main watasan australia kii ore se mahaj aadhe test maichon main hissaa le paae
 However, a big problem with Watson was that he could not rectify his mistakes
 wicket ke saamne pagabaadha out hona rahaa ho yaa phir set hone ko baad laaparvaahee main wicket ganvaana, watasan isamen sudhaar kar pate unke aakade kahin zyada damdaar hote
 The comments ab watasan kii umr bhi 34 saal kii ho chuki he, aise main test se sanyas kaa unhone bilkul sahi faisla liya he
 Under the leadership of Steven Smith, the team now needs fresh faces
 iske alaava michel marsh jaisaa joardaar olerounder shen watasan kii jagah lene ko bilkul taiyaar ho chukaa he
 In such a situation, the Australian team will not miss Watson
 vahiin duusari ore dabaav kam hone se watasan vanade or tii-20 cricket main kuch joardaar pradarshan jarur kar paaenge
 If we look at bowling, then the record of 75 wickets in 59 Tests cannot be said to be very attractive
 in maichon main watasan ne mahaj teen baar pari main paanch wicket chatkaaye
 The best performance of his career was six wickets in an innings against Pakistan, that too in 2010
 iske alaava watasan apane baari bharkam kad lathi ke chalate chotil bhi zyada hote rahe
 This is the reason that in his 11-year Test career, Watson was able to take part in just half of Test matches for Australia
 haalanki watasan ke saath ek badi mushkil ye bhi rahi ki ve apni galatiyon ko sudhaar nahin paae
 Becoming lbw in front of the wicket or losing the wicket carelessly after being set, Watson would have been more powerful if he could have improved it
 tippaniyan Now Watson is also 34 years old, so he has taken the right decision to retire from the Test
 steven smith kii captaini main team ko ab fresh chehron kii zyada jarurat he
 Apart from this, a strong all-rounder like Mitchell Marsh has been all set to replace Shane Watson
 aise main australian team ko watasan kii kami nahin khalegi
 On the other hand, Watson will be able to make some strong performances in odis and T20 cricket due to reduced pressure

 or duusari taraf ghaney jangal, patharile pahaad or un patharile pahaado main ghoomte insaan ke bhesh main jaanavar
 It is not possible to believe that even in such an environment, a person will eat human
 par afsos ye wo sach he jo ab chhan-chhanakar uttarakhand kii pahadiyon se baahar aa rahaa he
 At the time when people were struggling to save lives from the sky, when many people were counting their last breaths, and at the time when many people had lost their last breaths, at the same time there were some people who were dead The jewels were scratching the body, taking out the wallet from their pockets, and the women, the girls who had escaped alive, were bullying them
 chaar dham kii yatra par gaye devbhumi se jinda bachakar laute logon kii aapbeetee tharthara dene vaali he
 According to these people, a batch of Nepalese near Kedarnath, Badrinath and Gaurikund kept looting for two whole days
 kedarnath kii pahadiyon se bason main savaar hokar new tehri pahunche kuch logon ko vahaan pehle se tainaat uttarakhand police ne bas se utaara or apni hiraasat main le liya
 After this, his Jama was searched
 in logon ke paas se police ko kaaphi cash mili
 When questioned, these people could not give a correct answer, where did they get so much money from? The police suspect that the money is looted
 jo yatra main fanse yatriyon se luute gaye hai
 Police suspect that some of these Nepalese had also coerced women and women
 lihaaja inhen hiraasat main lene ke baad baqayada laudspikar par jagah-jagah ghoshnaa kii ja rahi thi ki agar kisi ke saath jor-jabardastee kii gai he to wo aakar in logon main se aaropee kii shinaakht karen
 Not only this, many Baba and priests returning from Kedarnath and Badrinath have also been detained by the police at various places
 inaki talshi main unke paas se lakhon rupee mili hai
 The police has received around one crore rupees from a monk
 ye paise usne dholak main chupa rakhe the
 The police suspect that these rupees are also of looting or have been extracted from the pockets of the dead
 yaa ye bhi mumkin he ki ye rupee mandir ke khajaane ke hon
 On the one hand there are piles of corpses and on the other side the struggle to live and among them, some people rob the lives of shrouds and dead people from the corpses
 uttarakhand ke pahaado par insaan ke bhesh main gum rahe in shaitanon ko dekhakar sachmuch kaa shaitan bhi sharmasaar ho jaataa
 But what should these humans do? Even those who are called humans are ashamed
 ek taraf kudarat kaa kahar or duusari taraf insaanon kaa
 After the devastation in Uttarakhand, if thousands of people extended their helping hand towards the people trapped in the inundation, then there were no less people who killed both humans and humanity as soon as they got the chance
 sailaab main apana sabakuch ganvaane ke baad jin logon ko jaan ke laale pade the, luteron ne vaadiyon main aise logon ko bhi nahin bakhsha
 It is a matter of more interaction with the living people
 police kii maane to is ilaake main maut ke munh main samaa chuke logon ke jism se bhi sone-chaandi ke zevar luute jane kii khabaren saamne ai hai
 Some people also got arrested from the police, from whom Rs 83 lakh was recovered
 or baad main poochtacha ke dauraan inhone mana ki ye rupee unhone sailaab ke shikaar logon se luute or laashon se batore the
 Surely these statements are going to shock any person from inside
 insaaniyat ko sharmasaar karanevaala aisa hi ek vakya madhyapradesh ke chhatarpur se aae logon ke saath hua
 a total of 66 people came from a village in Chhatarpur to visit Kedarnath
 lekin sailaab ke baad sirf 8 hi log bache
 No one knows where the other 58 people went
 lekin in 8 logon ke saath vahaan jo kuch hua, us par yakeen karnaa bhi mushkil he
 The Nepalese looted and beat up these people who climbed the mountains to save their lives
 ghar ke raste haridwar railway stesan par inhone khud par gujri jo kahani sunai wo hairaan karanevaali thi
 However, the havoc caused by the cloudburst on the mountains has affected humans in many ways
 kedarghati main aae sailaab main state bank kaa tregeri room bhi bah gaya or saath hi bah gaye 5 karod rupee
 But the extent was reached when the miscreants did not avoid committing too much with the women who were running here and there in the deserted desert to save their lives
 kai mahilaon ke akelepan or unki majaburi kaa phayda uthaakar badmaashon ne unke saath balaatkaar jaisi ghinauni vaardaat tak ko anjaam diya
 It is not right to take advantage of someone's helplessness, but just think of those trapped in the inundation of Uttarakhand who had to buy a biscuit of Rs 5 for a thousand rupees and a water bottle of 10 rupees for two thousand rupees to be alive
 kehane ko to inhen bechnewale dukandaar the, dhandha kar rahe the
 But in reality they were also robbers of corpses
 uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri vijay bahuguna kaa kahana he ki fanse hue logon ko 2 hajaar rupee milenge
 But Chief Minister, just know also what people will get from this two thousand rupees
 uttarakhand main aasamaani afat main fanse log jab dane-dane ko mohataaj the to us samay kai jagahon par lut machi thi
 Loot is such that you will be stunned to hear it
 gochar main maut ke munh se waapas laute kuch logon ne jo dekha or mahasoos kiya use sunakar aap chaunk bhi jaaenge or ghabara bhi jaaenge
 If people were caught on the way, they had to pay big money for every small thing
 aarope he ki madad ke naam par chal rahaa tha mahalut kaa khel
 People were suffering from hunger and thirst
 marataa kya naa karata
 The conditions that have been created after the tragedy in Uttarakhand are going to hurt
 sarkaar bhale hi yudhstar par raahat kaa daawa kar rahi he lekin jamini hakeekat kya he, wo traasadee kaa shikaar hue log bayaan kar rahe hai
 The government approved the proposal to increase the retirement age of High Court judges from 62 to 65 years
 is aashay kaa vidheyak sansad main pesh kiya jayega
 The move will benefit around 630 judges from 21 high courts of the country
 sarkari sutron ne bataaya ki kanoon mantralay monsoon satr main hi yah vidheyak pesh karnaa chaahati he lekin samvidhan sanshodhan karne ke liye sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko vishwaas main lenaa aavashyak he, kyonki loksabhaa or rajyasabha main kisi bhi samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak kaa do tihaai bahumat se paarit hona anivaary he
 Sources said that Law Minister Veerappa Moily wants a consensus to be reached before making amendments
 isse pehle 1963 main ucch nyaayalay ke nyaayadhishon kii sevanivritti aayu 60 se badhaakar 62 saal kii gayi thi
 In April 2008, the motion was tabled by the then Law Minister Hansraj Bhardwaj but the proposal was put on hold due to lack of consensus
 kendriya grih mantri amit shah ne somvaar ko jammu kashmir main lagu anuchhed 370 ko kamjor karne or 35 e hataane ke sankalp par charchaa ke dauraan bataaya ki in vishesh praavdhaanon ko kyon hataaya gaya? unhone kaha ki ghati ke logon ko bhi 21veen sadi ke saath jeene kaa adhikaar he
 Due to Article 370, the government's laws do not reach there
 modi sarkaar yuvaaon ko acha bhavishya dena chaahati he
 Responding to the allegations of the opposition, Amit Shah said that there is currently President's rule in Jammu and Kashmir and under that authority, the President's Constitution Order 2019 (for Jammu and Kashmir) is being presented in this House of Parliament
 amit shah ne kaha ki dhara 370 to pehle se hi asthai he or asthai vyavastha ko 70 saal tak khinchaa gaya
 He said that this amendment will not apply except for clause one of Article 370
 grih mantri shah ne prastaav kaa virodh karne vaale sadasyon se poocha ki jab aitihaasik rup se kendriya dhan kaa adhiktam hissaa jammu-kashmir ko diya jaataa rahaa, uske baad bhi yah buniyadi dhaanche, shiksha, swasthya suvidhaon, rojgaar ke avasar aadi vikaas ke kaaryon main kyon nahin parilakshith hua? unhone kaha ki raajnneetik phaayde ke liye yuvaaon kaa upyog kiya ja rahaa he
 Calculated this key point - 1
 2009 main desh ke sabhi bacchon ko sansad ne shiksha kaa adhikaar diya, lekin jammu kashmir kii sarkaar ne ise lagu nahin kiya
 Now all Kashmiri children will also get the benefit of Right to Education Act
 2
 No citizen of the country, who does not belong to Jammu and Kashmir, cannot invest in the state
 jameen or koi sampatti kisi bahari vyakti ke naam na ho paane ke kaaran nivesh par vipareet prabhaav padaa
 Now investment will also be possible
 3
 The people of Jammu and Kashmir do not get the benefit of any law passed by both houses of Parliament
 ab sansad dwaara paarit kanoon pradesh main bhi lagu honge
 4
 gulam nabi aaazaad kehete hai ki jammu kashmir ke logon kii bhi antarraji shaadiyaan hone lagi hai
 The question is that if the daughter there marries a boy from another state, then her property is taken away
 ab rajya sarkaar koi moulik adhikaar nahin chin sakegi
 5
 jammu kashmir ke dalit or pichde, anusuchit jati-janajati va anya virgon ko aarakshan kaa koi laabh nahin diya gaya, kyon? ab sabhi ko iskaa phayda milegaa
 The poor general class, Gurjar Muslims, all backward Dalits will be able to take advantage of this in Jammu and Kashmir
 6
 Terrorism originated in Jammu and Kashmir, grew and reached extremes
 ab dhalaan par he
 Due to 370 and 35A, the youth there were confused by some groups
 pakistan ne uskaa phayda uthaaya
 So far more than 41400 people have been killed, why killed? Whose policy killed these 41400 people? In 1988, the President of Pakistan, General Zia, said that as long as there is 370, the youth of Kashmir cannot connect with India in spirit
 sawaal he ki desh ke duusare rajyon kaa yuva gumraah nahin hota kyonki vahaan algaav paidaa karne vaali koi dhara nahin he, isliye keval kashmir main hi ye yuvaaon ko bhadakaate the
 7
 kya jammu kashmir ko kattarwadiyon ke rahamo-karam par chhod den, jo bhadakaate hai unke saare bete-betiyaan videsh main padhate hai
 Those who want to maintain 370 have earned a lot of goods in Kashmir
 videsh main sampatti khadi kar lee, kashmir ke saamaanya yuva ko ve keval murkh banaakar rakhana chaahate hai
 The youth there need good education, development
 medical or tourism ko badha sakate hai ham vahaan par
 Investment is needed to increase employment there
 isliye 370 ke kaante ko nikaalnaa aavashyak tha
 8
 nehru ji ne kaha tha ki 370 ghiste-ghiste ghis jayega, khatm ho jayega, samvidhan main ise asthaayee banaakar rakhaa tha
 It is said that Sardar Patel gave 370, it is wrong
 sardaar ne to puure desh ko ek or akhand banaaya
 Sardar Patel did not deal with Kashmir, he did deal with Junagadh and Hyderabad
 vah aaj hamaare saath he
 If Pandit Nehru deals with Kashmir, the problem is still visible
 9
 370 created terrorism in Kashmir, it is the mother of terror, people say that 370 connects India with Kashmir, it is right in the sense
 vaastaviktaa main nahin
 India’s involvement with Kashmir is due to 370
 370 to 1949 main aayaa jabaki bharat or kashmir kaa vilay maharaja harisingh ke patr ke kaaran 1947 main hi ho gaya tha
 10
 kashmir kii samskruti 370 ke kaaran surakshit nahin he
 The local culture of every state including Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu is safe in the country, so why can't the people of Kashmir be kept together
 kashmiri samskruti kii suraksha bhi shesh rajyon kii tarah ho sakati he
 There is no need to maintain 370 for this
 11
 Ram Manohar Lohia Ji said that as long as there is Article 370, there cannot be uniformity in India and Kashmir
 sansad main lohia ji ne ye baat kahi thi
 All the prominent leaders of the country had said this
 12
 Today is the right time to remove 370
 raajnneetik ichhashakti ke kaaran ise nahin hataaya ja sakaa tha
 Today Narendra Modi is the Prime Minister, so this will has arisen in the country and the Home Ministry has decided to end it
 13
 The reason behind why we should bring reservation bill in Kashmir is that if we pass here then it will be easy
 yadi vahaan kii sarkaar banegi to ab yah apane aap hi kashmir par lagu hoga
 14
 jammu kashmir kii janata se yahi kahana he ki jammu kashmir bharat kii mukut mani he
 If the situation remains normal in Jammu and Kashmir, then we will also normalize the situation very soon
 15
 Many states have been partitioned after independence in the country
 bijepi ne kiye, congress ne bhi kiye
 The opposition will remember the picture of the partition of Telangana and Andhra, how the bill was then passed
 prasaaran band kiya gaya, sansad main raat tak prakriya chali
 16
 jammu kashmir ke log 70 saal tak 370 ke saath jite rahe
 Now we are saying that give the youth of Jammu and Kashmir five years, we will show how we will make Jammu and Kashmir the number one state in the country
 17
 This is the way to solve the Jammu and Kashmir problem
 370 ko hamen khatm karnaa hi he
 18
 main sadan se prarthana karata hum ki jammu kashmir main hamen saamaanya sthiti laane ke liye praytn karnaa chahie
 The way to solve the Kashmir problem will come out from here
 vot bank kii raajnneeti hamen chhodani hogi
 The people of Kashmir have to tell us the reality
 un sabhi dalon ko dhanyavad, AAP ko, bispi ko, bijedy ko, ediemke ne samarthan kiya
 Thanks to all the parties who supported
 desh kii janata ko dhanyavad jisane ek swar se faisle kaa swaagat kiya he
 Seeing the conviction of the people, my faith has also increased
 19
 Today, we have put two resolutions, a bill and a reservation bill in Parliament
 sabhi se nivedan he ki ham acha sandesh kashmir ke logon ko bhejein
 i propose that the House concur on both the proposals and that both bills be passed
 20
 The issue of removing 370 has been included in our manifesto ever since we did not win any municipal election
 ham maanate the ki 370 kaa rasta galat he
 Today, in 2014, in 2019, the people of the country gave us a majority

 Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel are facing difficulties for making controversial comments and posters against Kashmiri girls
 dilli mahila ayog ne kashmiri ladakiyon ko lekar rajyasabha saansad vijay goyal ke poster or haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter kii vivaadit tippanee ko sangyaan liya he

 Apart from this, their actions can provoke violence in the already sensitive area of kashmir
 ucch sanvaidhanik padon par baithe logon ke is tarah ke bayaan ek pitrusattatmak samaaj kii dharna ko majboot karte hai or mahilaon va ladakiyon ke mahatv or aawaaj ko kamjor karte hai

 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has reacted sharply to the cutting of trees at Aarey Colony in Mumbai
 shivasena pramukh ne kaha he ki jin logon ne pedo kaa khun kiya he unhen dekh lenge
 The Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party have come face-to-face before voting for the assembly elections in Maharashtra
 maharashtra chunaav main bhale hi donon partiyaan saath hai lekin bayaanbajiyaan abhi bhi jari he
 The cutting of trees in Aare has given Shiv Sena a chance to open a front against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is heading the National Democratic Alliance (NDA)
 is dauraan uddhav thakare ne pedo ko kaatane par gahari naaraazgi jataai he
 He has said that the issue of cutting trees in saws is very serious
 maharashtra ke chunavi maahaul ke bich uddhav thakare ne kaha kigin logon ne pedo kaa khun kiya he unhen dekh lenge
 At the same time, Aditya Thackeray, a candidate from Worli assembly constituency and son of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray in Maharashtra elections, has also opposed the cutting of trees
 aditya ne naam liye bagaiyr sahyogi bijepi par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 In a tweet, he said that there is no point in speaking on plastic pollution from the way the forests are being cut

 a high profile case of defamation filed by the country's Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is going on in the High Court of Delhi
 yah cese arun jetali ne aam aadmi party ke sanyojak or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal or party ke anya chaar netaaon ke khilaaf daayar kiya he
 Now the Union Finance Minister and Defense Minister and senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley have filed a second defamation case against Arvind Kejriwal today
 yah cese bhi unhone 10 karod rupee kaa darj karaayaa he
 For information, let us tell you that Arun Jaitley has filed this case after Arvind Kejriwal was abused by Arun Jaitley during the cross-examination of renowned lawyer Ram Jethmalani
 pichhali sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne arvind kejariwal ke vakil ram jethmalani kii court main arun jetali par kii gai kai tippaniyon ko nindaatmak qaraar diya
 The court said that if Arvind Kejriwal has been asked to use this type of language, then there is no use to take the debate further in this matter
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki sunwaayee raghav chaddha kii ek apil par hui thi jisamen arun jetali ke vakeelon ne yah maamla uthaaya
 Judge Manmohan said that in such a situation, Kejriwal should first come and give a statement on his allegations
 yah puraa maamla tab prakaash main jab arun jetali kii ore se bahes ke liye aae vakeelon ne court se kaha ki pehle yah saaf ho janaa chahie ki jis bhashaa kaa prayog ram jethmalani kar rahe hai kya vah arvind kejariwal kii sahmati se ho rahaa he
 He also said that Ram Jethmalani has said that what he is saying he is saying on behalf of Arvind Kejriwal
 jetali ke vakeelon ne kaha ki arvind kejariwal ne agar aisi bhashaa kaa prayog karne kii ijaajat arun jetali ke khilaaf di he to phir ek or 10 karod kaa manahani kaa cese daayar kiya jayega
 After this, Judge Manmohan lashed out and said that when defamation case is already going on, no one can be insulted by using language in this way
 court main jaj ne kaha ki agar aisa hi kisi rape ke cese main hua hota to yah peedit ke pratadna ke baraabar hota
 After this, the court said that the lawyer of the victim can also do a second case in this case
 bataa den ki court ke sanyukt register ke saamne arun jetali kaa cross-ikjamination karte hue ram jethmalani ne crook (dhokheybaaj) shabd kaa prayog kiya tha
 This was followed by a heated debate between Jaitley and Jethmalani
 donon kii vakeelon kii team main bhi tikhi bahes hui maamle ko aage ke liye taalna padaa he
 The court has already called Kejriwal to give clarification by issuing notice in this matter
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki kejariwal ke edwocket ne on record ne court main saaf kah diya he ki is maamle main kejariwal kii ore se is prakaar ke shabdon ke prayog ke liye nahin kaha gaya he
 Whereas Ram Jethmalani has said in the court that he has received permission from Kejriwal for such cross examination
 iskaa sahi khulaasa ab kejariwal ke court ke court main bayaan ke baad hi ho paaegaa
 On the other hand, a legal screw in the case is also implicated whether the use of such language in court can be done or not
 abhi is par kuch bhi saaf nahin he
 It is so certain that if the matter of Ram Jethmalani comes true, Kejriwal will face another case and if it turns out wrong, Jethmalani has violated the rules of the lawyers
 arvind kejariwal ne arun jetali par didisie main pad par rahane ke dauraan bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaae or lagaataar kai manchon se kai sau karod ke ghotaale ke aarope lagaate rahe
 Arun Jaitley first warned him to file a defamation case without any evidence
 is chetavanee ko arvind kejariwal and team ne ek dhamkee ke taur par liya or chunauti pesh kii ki vah court jaaen vahaan par apane aap cese se jude aaropon kii sachai saamne aa jaaegi
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in the Narendra Modi government at the Center accepted the challenge and filed a defamation suit in the court
 ab is maamle main pichley kai maheenon se sunwaayee jari he
 On behalf of Arvind Kejriwal, the country's famous lawyer Ram Jethmalani is appearing in the case
 tippaniyan Ram Jethmalani and Arun Jaitley had a heated debate over the entire matter
 maamla ek yah bhi nikalakar saamne aayaa ki jo ram jethmalani is cese ko free main ladane kii baat kar rahe the un desh ke sabase mahange vakil ke liye dilli kii arvind kejariwal sarkaar ne karodon kii fees dene kaa jugad nikaal liya tha
 But the matter got stuck with the governor
 ab arvind kejariwal dilli ke mukhyamantri ke taur par is cese main ladaai ladane ke baat kah rahe hai
 For the sake of information, last Thursday's court hearing took a new turn when Arv Jaitley, who was arguing on behalf of Rajiv Nair and Sanjeev Sethi, asked a question which has increased Arvind Kejriwal's difficulties
 ab kendriya vittamantri or rakshaamantri tathaa bijepi ke varisht netaa arun jetali ne arvind kejariwal par aaj doosraa manahani kaa cese darj kiya he
 He has also filed a case of Rs 10 crore
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki arun jetali ne yah cese arvind kejariwal kii ore se cese lard rahe desh ke jane-maane vakil ram jethmalani kii jirah ke dauraan arun jetali ko apshabd kahe jane ke baad darj karaayaa he
 During the last hearing, the court termed many remarks made by Arvind Kejriwal's lawyer Ram Jethmalani in the court on Arun Jaitley as defamatory
 court ne kaha ki agar is prakaar kii bhashaa kaa prayog karne ke liye arvind kejariwal kii ore se kaha gaya he tab is maamle main bahes ko aage lene jane kaa koi phayda nahin he
 For information, let us know that the hearing was held on an appeal by Raghav Chadha in which Arun Jaitley's lawyers took up the case
 maamle ke jaj manmohan ne kaha ki aise main pehle kejariwal ko aakar apane aaropon par bayaan dena chahie
 This whole matter came to light when the lawyers who came for debate on behalf of Arun Jaitley told the court that first it should be clear whether the language which Ram Jethmalani is using is being used with the consent of Arvind Kejriwal
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki ram jethmalani yah kah chuke hai ki vah jo kah rahe hai wo arvind kejariwal kii taraf se kah rahe hai
 Jaitley's lawyers said that if Arvind Kejriwal has given permission to use such language against Arun Jaitley, then another 10 crore defamation case will be filed
 iske baad jaj manmohan ne latad lagaate hue saaf kaha ki jab pehle hi manahani kaa cese chal rahaa he tab is prakaar se bhashaa kaa prayog kar kisi kaa apmaan nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 In the court, the judge said that if the same thing happened in a rape case, it would have amounted to torture of the victim
 iske baad court ne kaha ki peedit ke vakil is maamle main doosraa cese bhi kar sakate hai
 Explain that while cross-examining Arun Jaitley in front of the joint registrar of the court, Ram Jethmalani used the word crook (deceiver)
 iske baad jetali or jethmalani main tikhi bahes hui
 Both the team of lawyers had a heated debate and had to postpone the case further
 court ne is maamle main notice jari kar kejariwal ko safai dene ke liye pehle hi bulaayaa he
 For information, let us know that Kejriwal's Advocate on record has clearly stated in the court that Kejriwal has not been asked to use such words in this case
 jabaki ram jethmalani ne court main kaha he ki is prakaar ke cross ikjamination ke liye unhen kejariwal se ijaajat mili he
 The correct disclosure of this will now be done only after Kejriwal's statement in court
 udhar, maamle main ek kanoonee pench yah bhi fansaa he ki kya court main hue is prakaar kii bhashaa ke istemaal par cese kiya ja saktaa he yaa nahin
 Nothing is clear on this yet
 itnaa jarur he ki ram jethmalani kii baat yadi sahi nikali to kejariwal ek or cese jhelenge or agar galat nikali to jethmalani ne vakeelon ke niyamon kaa ulanghan kiya he
 Arvind Kejriwal accused Arun Jaitley of corruption during his tenure in the DDCA and continued to accuse him of scam of several hundred crores from various forums
 bina saboot lagaataar aarope lagane par arun jetali ne unhen pehle to manahani kaa cese karne kii chetavanee di
 Arvind Kejriwal and team took this warning as a threat and presented a challenge that if they go to court there will automatically reveal the truth of the allegations related to the case
 centre kii narendra modi sarkaar main vittamantri arun jetali ne is chunauti kaa sweekaar kiya tha or court main manahani kaa mukadmaa daayar kar diya
 Now the case is going on for the last several months
 arvind kejariwal kii ore se is cese main desh ke jane maane vakil ram jethmalani ne cese main pairvi kar rahe hai
 The comments puure maamle main ram jethmalani or arun jetali main tikhi bahes hui
 The case also came out in one case that the Arvind Kejriwal government of Delhi had paid a bill of crores for the most expensive lawyer of the country, Ram Jethmalani, who was talking about fighting this case for free
 lekin maamla rajyapal ke paas jaakar atak gaya
 Now Arvind Kejriwal as the Chief Minister of Delhi is talking about fighting in this case
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki pichley guuruuvaar kii court kii sunwaayee main us samay ek nayaa mode aa gaya jab arun jetali kii ore se bahes kar rahe rajeev nair or sanjeev sethi ne ek aisa prashn puch liya jisase arvind kejariwal kii mushkilen bad gai hai
 During the last hearing, the court termed many remarks made by Arvind Kejriwal's lawyer Ram Jethmalani in the court on Arun Jaitley as defamatory
 court ne kaha ki agar is prakaar kii bhashaa kaa prayog karne ke liye arvind kejariwal kii ore se kaha gaya he tab is maamle main bahes ko aage lene jane kaa koi phayda nahin he
 For information, let us know that the hearing was held on an appeal by Raghav Chadha in which Arun Jaitley's lawyers took up the case
 maamle ke jaj manmohan ne kaha ki aise main pehle kejariwal ko aakar apane aaropon par bayaan dena chahie
 This whole matter came to light when the lawyers who came for debate on behalf of Arun Jaitley told the court that first it should be clear whether the language which Ram Jethmalani is using is being used with the consent of Arvind Kejriwal
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki ram jethmalani yah kah chuke hai ki vah jo kah rahe hai wo arvind kejariwal kii taraf se kah rahe hai
 Jaitley's lawyers said that if Arvind Kejriwal has given permission to use such language against Arun Jaitley, then another 10 crore defamation case will be filed
 iske baad jaj manmohan ne latad lagaate hue saaf kaha ki jab pehle hi manahani kaa cese chal rahaa he tab is prakaar se bhashaa kaa prayog kar kisi kaa apmaan nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 In the court, the judge said that if the same thing happened in a rape case, it would have amounted to torture of the victim
 iske baad court ne kaha ki peedit ke vakil is maamle main doosraa cese bhi kar sakate hai
 Explain that while cross-examining Arun Jaitley in front of the joint registrar of the court, Ram Jethmalani used the word crook (deceiver)
 iske baad jetali or jethmalani main tikhi bahes hui
 Both the team of lawyers had a heated debate and had to postpone the case further
 court ne is maamle main notice jari kar kejariwal ko safai dene ke liye pehle hi bulaayaa he
 For information, let us know that Kejriwal's Advocate on record has clearly stated in the court that Kejriwal has not been asked to use such words in this case
 jabaki ram jethmalani ne court main kaha he ki is prakaar ke cross ikjamination ke liye unhen kejariwal se ijaajat mili he
 The correct disclosure of this will now be done only after Kejriwal's statement in court
 udhar, maamle main ek kanoonee pench yah bhi fansaa he ki kya court main hue is prakaar kii bhashaa ke istemaal par cese kiya ja saktaa he yaa nahin
 Nothing is clear on this yet
 itnaa jarur he ki ram jethmalani kii baat yadi sahi nikali to kejariwal ek or cese jhelenge or agar galat nikali to jethmalani ne vakeelon ke niyamon kaa ulanghan kiya he
 Arvind Kejriwal accused Arun Jaitley of corruption during his tenure in the DDCA and continued to accuse him of scam of several hundred crores from various forums
 bina saboot lagaataar aarope lagane par arun jetali ne unhen pehle to manahani kaa cese karne kii chetavanee di
 Arvind Kejriwal and team took this warning as a threat and presented a challenge that if they go to court there will automatically reveal the truth of the allegations related to the case
 centre kii narendra modi sarkaar main vittamantri arun jetali ne is chunauti kaa sweekaar kiya tha or court main manahani kaa mukadmaa daayar kar diya
 Now the case is going on for the last several months
 arvind kejariwal kii ore se is cese main desh ke jane maane vakil ram jethmalani ne cese main pairvi kar rahe hai
 The comments puure maamle main ram jethmalani or arun jetali main tikhi bahes hui
 The case also came out in one case that the Arvind Kejriwal government of Delhi had paid a bill of crores for the most expensive lawyer of the country, Ram Jethmalani, who was talking about fighting this case for free
 lekin maamla rajyapal ke paas jaakar atak gaya
 Now Arvind Kejriwal as the Chief Minister of Delhi is talking about fighting in this case
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki pichley guuruuvaar kii court kii sunwaayee main us samay ek nayaa mode aa gaya jab arun jetali kii ore se bahes kar rahe rajeev nair or sanjeev sethi ne ek aisa prashn puch liya jisase arvind kejariwal kii mushkilen bad gai hai
 Judge Manmohan said that in such a situation, Kejriwal should first come and give a statement on his allegations
 yah puraa maamla tab prakaash main jab arun jetali kii ore se bahes ke liye aae vakeelon ne court se kaha ki pehle yah saaf ho janaa chahie ki jis bhashaa kaa prayog ram jethmalani kar rahe hai kya vah arvind kejariwal kii sahmati se ho rahaa he
 He also said that Ram Jethmalani has said that what he is saying he is saying on behalf of Arvind Kejriwal
 jetali ke vakeelon ne kaha ki arvind kejariwal ne agar aisi bhashaa kaa prayog karne kii ijaajat arun jetali ke khilaaf di he to phir ek or 10 karod kaa manahani kaa cese daayar kiya jayega
 After this, Judge Manmohan lashed out and said that when defamation case is already going on, no one can be insulted by using language in this way
