 Today is Kargil Victory Day
 16 saal pehle do maheene kii ladaai ke baad pakistani ghuspaithion ko hamaare sena ke jambaajon ne maar bhagaaya tha
 It is a different matter that about 500 soldiers had to pay their lives for it
 puraa desh sainikon kii qurbaani ko yaad rahaa he or jab desh shaheedon ko salaami de rahaa he to pradhanmantri narendra modi kaise peeche rahete
 He tweeted that "kargil Victory Day is a reminder of the valor, valor and sacrifice of our army
 mathrubhumi par sarvasv nyaujowar karne vaale amar shaheedon ko shat shat naman
 " par baat itani bhar nahin he
 Due to which he won in Kargil, today he is on hunger strike for his demands
 pichley 42 dinon se keval jantar-mantar par hi nahin desh ke 70 jagahon par purv sainik riley bhukh hadtaal par baithe he
 Today, the Prime Minister also spoke about the mind, but the soldiers sitting on the dharna did not even remember
 in sainikon kaa dharna tudwane ke liye sarkaar kaa koi numanida ab tak nahin aayaa
 Social activist Anna Hazare also reached out to support the ex-servicemen
 anna ne sarkaar par hamale karne main koi kasar nahin chodi
 Said, Raghukul Reet always came to pran jay but promise, directly targeted the government by saying this and said that you promised to give one rank one pension to the soldiers, then why not fulfill it
 bhrashtrachaar mitaane kaa vaada kiya, lokapal laane kaa vaada kiya or kuch bhi puraa nahin kiya
 Anna Hazare said that if the Central Government is thinking that it is in the majority and cannot do any harm to it then it is in misunderstanding
 har din ke saath uskaa nuksaan badhata ja rahaa he or ek din use badi haani kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 Anna condemned the government for this, so far no government representative came to take care of the soldiers sitting in hunger strike
 vaise anna jab jantar-mantar par pahunche to vahaan par do-do manch dekhakar anchabhit jarur hue
 The soldiers have been sitting on a hunger strike for 42 days on one platform, while the other group of ex-soldiers made a separate platform for Anna overnight
 baad main anna duusare manch par bhi gaye
 The comments donon manchon se sainik ekta ko lekar naaraa lagata rahaa or kaha gaya ki van rank van pension kii maang ko lekar saare sainik ek he
 Major General Satbir Singh, who has taken the lead on this stage, has said that he has been told that Anna has got z plus security
 isi kaaran alag manch banane kii jarurat padi
 At the same time, Lieutenant General Raj Kadian, who leads the second platform, says that Anna had no idea about this and he went to where the organizer said, it would have been better if the government had gathered more pressure

 purv sainikon ko apana samarthan dene saamaajik kaaryakarta anna hajaare bhi pahunche
 Anna left no stone unturned to attack the government

 Promised to eradicate corruption, promised to bring Lokpal and accomplished nothing
 anna hajaare ne kaha ki agar centre sarkaar yah soch rahi he ki vah bahumat main he or use koi nuksaan nahin pahunchaa saktaa to vah galatfahami main he
 With every day his loss keeps increasing and one day he will have to face great loss
 anna ne is baat ke liye sarkaar kii ninda kii abhi tak bhukh hadtaal main baithe sainikon kii sud lene koi sarkari numaayinda nahin aayaa
 By the way, when Anna reached Jantar Mantar, he was surprised to see two forums there

 5% of the population and is headed by Anupriya Patel, a minister at the Center
 lekin bijepi kaa trump card piem modi khud the
 By introducing Narendra Modi (who hails from Teli Jati) as an OBC leader and with a strong development agenda, the BJP managed to get the scattered backward votes in its favor - it got overwhelming support of around 60 per cent among the most backward
 
 yah pehali baar nahin tha jab bijepi ne ati shashakt vot bank ke rup main ati pichhadaa varg kii kshamta ko pahachaanaa tha
 He was united in large numbers during the agitation for the Ram temple in Ayodhya in the late 1980s, but the movement was led by OBC leaders Kalyan Singh and Uma Bharti, who belong to the Lodh caste
 kalyaan singh do baar upi ke mukhyamantri bane, pehali baar 1991 main or phir 1997 main
 Gradually, the Ram temple construction movement weakened and the BJP lost power and its grip on the backward castes also became loose and they moved towards Mayawati and Samajwadi Party
 ek baar phir bijepi ke saamne 2014 ke baad is vot bank ko banaae rakhane kii chunauti he
 The party started laying its foundation by giving important posts to the leaders of the most backward classes
 jaise keshav prasad maury jo ki kushvaha jati ke hai or loksabhaa saansad hai, ko party ne pradesh adhyaksh banaaya
 At the same time, the party president Amit Shah included many OBC leaders of the Samajwadi Party in the BJP, while at the same time many BSP cadres joined the party
 inamen upi main bispi main pichde varg kaa cheharaa maane jane vaale swami prasad maury bhi shaamil hai
 Meanwhile, Akhilesh Yadav approved the inclusion of 17 backward castes in the list of Scheduled Castes, making these castes eligible for central government welfare schemes and jobs reserved for disadvantaged sections
 bijepi akhilesh ke is kadam kaa muqabla karne ke liye ati pichhadon ko sarkari naukariyon or sarkari shiksha sansthaanon main 27 fisadi aarakshan dene kaa vaada kar rahi he, vartmaan main yah anya pichhadaa varg ke logon ko diya ja rahaa he
 The party has fielded around 170 candidates from the Backward Classes and non-yadav Backward Classes, which is more than its opponents

 'I voted for Modi ji but my wages have not increased so far
 ' Before the 2014 general elections, the BJP, which was trying to strengthen its base among the upper castes in the state, realized the neglect felt by the most backward classes
 uske baad party ne jati aadhaarit kai choti partiyon se gathbandhan kiya

 prasad verma or samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke rashtriya adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ab kattar virdohi hai
 Some angry people from Gonda parliamentary constituency, 120 km from Lucknow, do not want to see the face of their MP, 72-year-old Verma in the 2012 assembly election, but at the foundation stone laying ceremony of Indian Telecom Industry (ITI) held in Mujehana constituency of Gonda on March 16, Beni is the life of Gonda, Beni is the pride of the Congress and only one mission of Beni, Rahul Rahul Ban Desh ka PM was shouting slogans
 baari bheed or goonjte naaron se abhibhoot benny ne apni bayaan bahaduree dikhaai or bol baithe, ''mulaayam sabase bade beyimaan hai, lutere hai
 They have relationships with terrorists
 vah meri hatya kara dena chaahate hai
 '' Then what was left
 upi kii sadakon par benny ke putale phunke jane lage, sansad main bhuuchaal aa gaya
 The strings of political equations started connecting
 benny ke sapa chhodie ke baad se pehali baar mulaayam singh ne unke khilaaf morcha kholaa or sarkaar se unki barkhaastagi par ad gaye
 Although Verma is now recognized as a big-time leader, Beni's image was that of a militant socialist leader who started his political journey in 1970 when he was elected to the post of Director and Deputy Chairman of Ken Union Burwal Ramnagar, Barabanki
 1974 main ve bhartiya lokdal ke tikat par pehali baar vidhayak bane
 a law graduate from Lucknow University, Beni first became the Minister of Sugarcane Development, Sugar Industry and Prison Reforms Department in the Janata Party government in 1979
 usee vakt benny or mulaayam singh ke bich nazdikiyaan badhin
 In 1989, when the Janata Dal government was formed under Mulayam Singh's leadership in the state, Beni got the number two position as Minister of Public Works and Parliamentary Affairs
 1992 main jab mulaayam singh kii adhyakshata main sapa kaa gathan hua to benny party ke rashtriya mahasachiv bane
 Political analyst Abhay Kumar says, "the Samajwadi Party was primarily a backward class party
 mulaayam ko pichde varg main yadavon kaa samarthan tha to benny kurmiyon ke ecchhatra netaa ke rup main ubhare the
 In the 1996 Lok Sabha elections, Beni won the election from Kaiserganj on the SP ticket and showed his presence in the politics of the Center with Mulayam
 1996 se 1998 ke bich unhone centre kii united front kii sarkaar main sansadeey kaary rajyamantri or uske baad cabinet mantri ke taur par sanchaar mantralay kaa kaarybhaar sambhala
 In 2004, Beni was elected as an MP from Kaiserganj for the fourth time
 is vakt upi main sapa kii sarkaar thi or yahi vah samay tha, jab benny or mulaayam main dooriyaan baxi shuru huin
 J
 co-chairman of Zonal Coordination Committee of State Congress and close to Benny
 pi
 Singh says, "amar Singh was behind the breakup of the two
" '' sapa ke ek varisht netaa bataate hai ki amar singh baharich main vakaar ahamed shah or barabanki main arvind singh gop ko benny ke mukaable khadaa kar rahe the
 Angered by this, he broke away from the party in 2007 and formed his own party 'samajwadi Kranti Dal' (SKD)
 2007 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main benny ayodhya se lade or apni jamaanat tak na bachaa sake
 On the other hand, the Congress, which was trying to strengthen its feet in UP, did not have a big backward leader and this compulsion made the Congress and Beni join
 2008 main benny congress main shaamil hue
 In 2009, he contested from his old seat Kaiserganj in Gonda, a parliamentary constituency with 15 per cent Kurmi voters
 chunaav main voton kaa ganit benny ke paksh main feet baitha or ve chunaav jeet gaye
 In the 2012 Legislative Assembly elections, the Congress led Beni to pull backward class vote bank
 isi ranneeti ke tahat 2011 main pehle benny ko ispaat mantralay main rajyamantri (swatantra prabhaar) banaaya gaya or agle hi saal 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle unka kad badhaakar unhen ispaat mantralay kaa cabinet mantri bana diya gaya
 The Congress' backward card as Benny proved to be a flop in the assembly elections
 gonda, barabanki jaise kurmi bahulya or benny kii pakad vaale ilaakon main congress ko ek bhi seat nahin mili
 SP Mishra, 65, a retired professor of Gonda, says, "benny has still not become a common leader of the backward
 unhen keval gonda, barabanki kii kurmi birdari kaa hi samarthan he
 "apart from this, they could not even wash the stains of the draft riots
 vidhansabha chunaav main mili buree haar kii dhul jhadakar benny ek baar phir se uth khadey hue hai
 They have organized a dozen gatherings in Gonda during the last six months to Rs 20,000 crore
 kii yojanaon kii ghoshnaa kar chuke hai
 But most of the headlines in these meetings have been shared by Beni's statements about Mulayam
 janvari main akhilesh sarkaar ne benny ko mili jed shrenee kii suraksha ko ghataakar eks shrenee kar diya
 Not only this, in February, in the expansion of the Council of Ministers of UP Government, Ganda made a strategy to surround Beni by replacing the number of ministers from the number one, his mercury against Mulayam reached its peak
 sapa pramukh ko khijhane vaale bayanon ke baad kendriya grih mantralay ne ispaat mantri ko jed-plus suraksha muhaiyaa kara diya
 The funny thing is that earlier when the Beni had asked for Surahna, the Ministry under the then Home Minister had bluntly said that there was no threat to his life
 lekin benny-mulaayam ke is jang main congress apane netaa ke saath khadi he
 Pradeep Mathur, leader of the Congress Legislature Party, says, "beni Babu is a leader of the poor and backward
 unhone kabhi bhi apane sidghanton se samjhauta nahin kiya
 That is why they knock opponents

 Some people here have accused the hospital management that doctors continued to treat an old woman even after death
 maamle main parijanon kii shikaayat ke baad police ne jaanch ke aadesh die hai
 This case is related to the famous Paras Hospital in Patna
 mritika ke parijanon ne aspataal prabandhan par ilaaj ke naam par galat bill banane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 a case has been registered at Shastri Nagar police station in Patna on charges of cheating
 pehle chuttee di, phir kiya bharteebataya jaataa he ki sitamarhi jile ke simra gaanv kii 62 varshiya shail devi ko ilaaj ke liye paraaspatalmen 6 agast ko bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 Shail Devi was admitted to the hospital till 14 August
 14 agast ko unhen aspataal se chuttee bhi de di gai
 Shail Devi arrived back at the hospital on 15 August for a checkup
 is baar unhen yah kahkar bhartee kiya gaya ki unki haalat chintajanak he
 Rokshail Devi's son Praveen Chandra, on meeting after being taken to the ICU, alleges that his mother was admitted to the ICU after the situation was said to be worrisome and then the visit was banned
 praveen kehete hai, 'marij kii haalat poochne par doctor sirf bahaanaa banaate rahe or kai tarah kii beemaari hone kii baat karte rahe
 Meanwhile, suddenly Sheela Devi's daughter forcibly entered the ICU and found that the monitor had pulse rate and heartbeat zero
 baavjood iske doctor bevajaah uskaa ilaaj karte rahe
 The fraud case was filed by Praveen who said that when he talked to the doctors about this, the whole team got involved with him
 praveen chandra kaa aarope he ki unki maa kii maut ho chuki thi uske babajood paras aspataal prabandhan unke shav ko supurd karne ke bajaay unka ilaaj karti rahi
 Praveen has registered a case of fraud on the management of Paras Hospital in Shastri Nagar police station
 patna ke esaspi manu maharaj ne kaha ki aspataal prabandhan ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya gaya he or jaanch kii ja rahi he
 Second-hand information about the patient On the other hand, in addition to Paras Hospital, Medical Superintendent Dr
 shaiyad asif rahamaan ne sabhi aaropon ko sire se khaarij kiya he
 He said that his son Praveen Chandra was informed every moment about the condition of the patient
 unhone kaha ki praveen chandra nhospatalake kai form par usko padhakar or samajhakar hastakshar bhi kiya he
 Dr
 shaiyad asif rahamaan ne kaha ki jahaan tak maut ke baad bhi ilaaj karne kii baat he, to maut ke baad sirf pumpig kii ja rahi thi
 He said that the intention of Paras Hospital has never been like this and neither will happen

 unhone kaha ki hamane jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 hataae jane kaa samarthan jarur kiya ho lekin hamen ghati main maujuud halaat ko lekar chintaa he
 We have expressed concern to the Government of India to keep the leaders of Jammu and Kashmir and the former Chief Minister under house arrest and imprisonment
 unhone kaha ki hamanen bharat sarkaar se maanavadhikaar kaa sammaan karne kii baat kahi he, saath hi hamanen ghati main sabhi sevaayen jisamen internet or mobile phone seva bhi shaamil hai, ko behaal karne kii baat kahi he
 Earlier, the Trump administration said on Tuesday that it supports India's motive behind repealing Article 370 of the Constitution granting special status to Jammu and Kashmir, but is concerned about the current situation in the Valley
 usne kaha tha ki vah bharat ke paanch agast ke is faisle ke baad se rajya main halaat par kareeb se najar rakh rahaa he
 The US Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia, Alice G
 Wells, told the Asia, Pacific and Disarmament Subcommittee of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the US House of Representatives that the Indian government has argued that the decision to repeal most of the provisions of Article 370 All in Jammu and Kashmir for economic development, reducing corruption and especially in the context of women and minorities Ashtryy laws have been taken to implement equality
 wales ne kaha tha ki ham in uddeshyon kaa samarthan karte hai, lekin america videsh mantralay kashmir ghati main halaat ko lekar chintit he jahaan paanch agast ke baad kareeb 80 lakh logon kaa dainik jivan buree tarah prabhavit hua he
 He said that since this decision, the US has been closely monitoring the situation in Jammu and Kashmir
 wales ne kaha, ‘‘haalanki jammu or ladakh main halaat sudhare hai, lekin ghati main sthiti saamaanya nahin hui he
 He said that the US State Department has expressed concern to the Government of India regarding the detention of leaders and local residents, including the former Chief Ministers of Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha tha ki hamane bharat sarkaar se maanavadhikaron kaa sammaan karne or internet evam mobile networkon samet sevaaon tak purna pahunch behaal karne kii apil kii he
 Wells had said that the developments in Kashmir have been covered extensively by foreign and local journalists but they are facing difficulties due to security restrictions

 sarkaar ko notebandi or jiesti ke baad dhimi padi arthvyavastha main jaan foonkani he to niveshkon ko bhi aakarshith karnaa he
 Apart from this, wooing voters before next year's Lok Sabha elections and assembly elections in many states will also be among the priorities of the government
 haalanki, yah kaam sarkaar ke liye aasaan nahin rahegaa
 NITI Aayog Deputy Chairman Rajiv Kumar has predicted that the fiscal deficit for the financial year 2017-18 may be higher than the budget estimate
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ke vinievesh or gaiyr kar rajasav sangrah se kuch had tak isaki bharpai hui he, par agar bajet main loklubhaavni ghoshnaaen kii gayi to sarkaar ko nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 Know what weight the government may have to bear
 iskar chhot kii seemaa 2
 5 lakh to 3 lakh rupees, 2 at this time
 5 lakh rupee tak kii salanaa aay tex free he
 There is a demand to increase it to Rs 3 lakh
 sabase zyada logon kii nazren isi slab par he, kyonki pichhali baar bhi isamen koi badlaav nahin kiya gaya tha
 By taxing your income of Rs 50,000 annually, you will be able to save Rs 2,500 every year at the rate of 5% interest charged on it, that is, about Rs 200 every month
 is slab main kareeb 2 karod ykardaata hai
 The government is estimated to lose about Rs 5,300 crore by raising the exemption limit to Rs 50,000
 yani aapke 200 rupee bachaane par sarkaar ko 5,300 karod rupee kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padegaa
 Limit 1 to 80C
 5 lakh se 2 lakh rupee karne parais samay inakam tex kii dhara 80C ke tahat karadaataaon ko 1
 Up to 5 lakh rupees are available
 ise badhaakar 2 lakh rupee karne kii maang kii ja rahi he
 If this happens, then 50 lakh taxpayers will be able to save Rs 50,000 or more every year
 isse har saal kareeb 25,000 karod rupee tex free ho jaaenge
 If 10 on it
 3 fisadi kii dar se tex kaa anumaan lagaaya jaae to isse sarkaar ko 2,575 karod rupee kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padegaa
 There are three income tax slabs in the country at the time of making changes to the three income tax slabs
 pehle slab main 2
 Annual income up to Rs 5 lakh is tax free
 2
 5 Lakhs to 5 Lakhs are taxed at 5% per annum income
 5 lakh se 10 lakh tak kii salanaa aay waalon par 20 fisadi tex lagata he
 There is a provision of 30 percent tax on annual income of more than Rs 10 lakh annually
 is samay 5 lakh rupee salanaa vaale karadaataaon kii sankhya 6
 22 lakhs
 isliye agar 10% ke inakam tex slab ko badhaakar 6 lakh kar diya jaataa to har saal sarkaar ko inakam tex collection main lagbhag 640 karod kam milenge
 If the slab of 20% is increased to Rs
 12 lakhs, then the government may incur a loss of about Rs
 520 crores every year
 iskar par sarcharge hataane sebharat sarkaar 50 lakh rupee se zyada kii salanaa aay par 10% sarcharge vasuulati he
 Surcharge increases to 15% per cent on income above Rs 1 crore
 agar sarkaar is baar ke bajet main ucch aay par sarcharge hataa detii he to sarkaar ko har saal lagbhag 3,500 karod rupee ke nuksaan kaa anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa he

 aapako ye sunakar aashcharya ho saktaa he lekin ye sach he ki shaadishuda mard bhi flert karte hai
 Even some married women do this
 jab tak ye baaten baatcheet tak rahen tab tak to phir bhi thik hai lekin isaki bhi ek seemaa nirdhaarit honi chahie
 Flirting increases self-confidence and then a person starts to move one step everyday
 aise logon ko shuruyaat main hi roak dena acha hota he lekin kuch aise bhi hote hai jo asahmati jataane ke baavjood rukate nahin hai
 This habit of theirs grows every day and then they move from conversation to touching or obscene things
 aise main sthiti kaaphi tanaavpurn ho jaati he
 But sitting calm is not the solution
 aap kisi ko bhi ye haq na den ki wo aapako dukhi kare
 If you do not like that person to say such things, then refuse him strictly
 iske saath hi aap use rokane ke liye ye tareeke bhi apana sakati hai:1
 Do not be happy with his words
 Every girl and woman likes to hear his praise, but if a married man is flirting with you then do not be happy at all
 aapkaa ye sakaaratmak ravaiya use galat sanket de saktaa he
 He may feel that you too are in love with him
 aisa sochakar wo apni harkaton par kabhi bhi lagaam nahin lagayegaa balki apni simaaon ko or badhaata hi jayega
 2
 use yaad dilaaein kii wo shaadishuda hedgar koi shaadishuda mard aapse flert kar rahaa he touse yaad dilaaein ki wo shaadishuda he
 The first thing you should put in front of her is that she is someone's husband
 ho saktaa he ki jab use ye ehsaas ho to wo flert karnaa band kar de
 3
 spasht shabdon main kah den apni baedgar koi shaks shaadishuda hone ke baavjood aapse flert kar rahaa he or aapako uski harakatein pasand nahin aa rahi hai to aap use saaf shabdon main manaa kar sakati hai
 You should not have any hesitation in saying so
 4
 Should be advised not to do it again, if a married man is trying to flirt with you, then refuse it only after his first attempt
 use saaf kah den ki aapako ye sabakuch pasand nahin he or wo aapse is tarah kii baaten na kare
 5
 chetavanee de deshgar aapako lagata he ki aapke lakh samajhane ke baavjood wo shaks kuch bhi samaj nahin rahaa he to aap use chetavanee de sakati hai
 You can tell him that you will say this to his wife
 itane ke baavjood agar koi shaks aapako lagaataar pareshaan kar rahaa he to aap police kii madad bhi le sakati hai

 When this scale and its execution is faulty, how will it benefit the people? The People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), of which i am a member myself, is part of a coalition working on the right to food, which is campaigning for an adequate supply of food for all citizens of India

 PUCL had filed a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court and the campaign started after that

 isse anaaj kii barabaadi bhi kam hogi
 The system was also recommended by the National Advisory Council headed by Sonia Gandhi

 In the Food Security Bill, the Government has left scope that it will convert PDS into cash transfer whenever it wants

 According to a research by economist Utsa Patnaik, there has been a permanent decline in food consumption in this country over the last ten years
 das saal pehle paanch logon kaa parivaar salanaa 880 kilo anaaj upbhog karata tha, aaj yah aankada salanaa 770 kilo par aa gaya he
 Since this is an average figure, this implies that consumption has increased among economically disadvantaged people, whereas in the case of economically backward people, the consumption decline has been much higher
 ham aisi duniya main rahete hai jahaan akaal ko vinaashak mana jaataa he or uski mukhya vajah khaadya utpaadan main kami hoti he
 In India, however, the lack of food production is not responsible for it, but the lack of access to food
 ham aise tantra main rah rahe hai jo saamaajik str par bhedbhaavpurn he, jahaan kuch vishisht samooh kinhin duusare samoohon ke mukaable kahin zyada prabhavit hai

 According to the press reports, in the Cabinet meeting held on December 14, 2011, Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar had questioned how the government can be responsible to feed every person of the country if there was a famine in the country

 isliye sarkaar ne sadan se kaise manzuri lee, jammu-kashmir main rajyapal ne ijazat di mukhyamantri se leni chahie jaisi baton ke myne hai, lekin ho ye sarkaar ne jataa diya ki zaruri nahin
 Let us first recall what Babasaheb had said on 370- You want India to protect Kashmir, Kashmiris should have equal rights all over India but do not want to give any rights to India and Indians in Kashmir
 main bharat kaa kanoon mantri hum or main apane desh ke saath is tarah kii dhokhadhadi main shaamil nahin ho saktaa
 Now let's return
 
 
 do sarkaron kii baat par 
 
 
 Yes, sir, believe it or not Chief Minister, or sadar-e-riyasat
 
 
 to Now understand the democracy of Kashmir, which was once called by the prophet Nabi Hagaru, 'made by Khaliq' - in fact in 1951 against Sheikh Abdullah's party, only 2 seats in 75 elections were held, the rest of them were elected unopposed
 
 
 abdul kaaliq ji ne abdulla kii party ke kilaaf chunaav ladane vaale kisi bhi ummidavaar kaa parchaa kisi na kisi bahaane kaarij kar diya tha
 Then how Pandit Nehru sacked the government
 bich main bada sandehaaspad sa dilli agreement bhi ho gaya
 Then 1965 also came when sadar-e-riyasat was changed to the post of Governor in the state, through the sixth amendment to its constitution
 
 
 kuch saalon pehle hoicourt ne kaha bhi tha ki ye ise badalanaa rajya vidhayika par he, lekin gauratlab ye he ki ise ab tak badla nahin gaya
 Then came the 1987 turning point of Kashmir
 
 
 jahaan emuef kii jeet ko haar main tabdeel karne ke aarope lage or shuru hua aatankwaad kaa antaheen silsilaa
 
 kair se sab padhane samajhane kii shaayad fursat naa ho, yaa ise kehane par aap ek nae fashneble shabd se kaarij kar den 
 
 
 However, the purpose of writing was that when there is no Chief Minister from 7-8 percent of the voting (almost such percentage is elected by mlas in parts of Kashmir Valley), then sadar-e-riyasat is the Governor and this system is Jammu and Kashmir
 Was under the constitution of 
 
 is bare main bahut se logon ne kai pahaluon par baat kii he, lekin chunki 370 main badlaav constitunt assembly kii anushansa se hoga jo november 1956 main dissolve ho gai is maamle main bagaiyr koi praavdhaan banaae
 That is why many experts are saying the decision of Monday is only constitutional
 kair 
 
 
 Let those who roared for 370 roar tell why the unemployment rate in Jammu and Kashmir was higher than the national average in all these years, what a lot of jobs will be created by the withdrawal of 370 from those who are happy to tear a question
 yahi sawaal skool-college, aspataalon ko lekar bhi he
 The people whose patriotism is hitting the hillocks, it is even there to grab the land
 
 
 kya is soch se aap laal chowk par tirange kii baaten karte rahe hai
 Now let me return to my original question how did you make it hindu-muslim
 soshal media se lekar desh ke tamaam hisson main khush hone vaale ek khaas vichaardhaara ke samarthak hai, to dukhi hone vaale bhi mazahab ke naam par bisur rahe hai
 Is Kashmir merely a religion and ideology, or a territory of the flesh and flesh? It is true that the valley is Muslim majority, but their basic needs will also be education, health, employment
 
 
 ye maananaa nazaren churaane jaisaa hoga ki kashmir kaa andolan tezi se dharm ke mulamme se lipatata ja rahaa tha, ye bhi sahi he ki use khinchne kaa jor lagane waalon kaa judaav bhi dharm vishesh se hi tha
 But in this loud trial we forget the minorities of the valley
 
 
 panditon kii vyathaa kisi se chhipi nahin he 
 
 
 Millions of people became refugees in their country
 
 
 kuch abhi bhi vahiin hai 
 
 
 Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Shia too
 
 
 kya inaki koi awaz he
 
 
 The majorityism that you have abused in other parts of the country, will you loot all the sympathy in Kashmir right there
 
 
 thodi si bachaakar dusron ke liye bhi rakh len 
 
 
 One more important thing
 
 
 jab vilay hua to bhugaulik, aarthik saamaajik halaat kuch or the
 
 
 Kashmir was plagued by tribal attacks
 
 
 aaj samrik rup se ahm pakistan par america kii nazre inayat phir ho gai he 
 
 
 From weapons to dollars, it has started raining
 
 
 
 In such a situation, the meaning of the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan can be understood
 
 
 aise main desh kii chuni sarkaar ke paas agar vajah hai to logon kii suraksha uskaa farz he
 
 
 Well 
 
 
 last thing 
 
 
 ab whatsap uniwarsity kii kuch baton par bhi yaqiin karnaa padegaa 
 
 
 At least in the case of Kashmir, the form seems to have been leaked in front of the graduate here
 
 
 vaise is prashn patr main ek sawaal silebus se baahar kaa lagata he 
 
 
 Change a state into a union territory
 
 
 yaad rakhana hoga ki bharosa saalon main jeeta jaataa he, lekin ek galat qadam jatke main use tod bhi detaa he
