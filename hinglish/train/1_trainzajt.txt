 With the start of the budget session, other opposition parties, including BJP, started demanding a discussion on inflation
 haalanki pehle bijepi ne loksabhaa main mahangaai par charchaa ke liye kaam roko prastaav diya tha, lekin sarkaar ne use thukraa diya tha
 The BJP, which has been in the role of a weak opposition till now on the issue of inflation, has started pressuring the government like other opposition parties
 isse pehle bijepi parliamentry kii baithak main party ke tamaam saansad sadan main sarkaar ko gherne kii ranneeti par vichaar kiya

 Obviously, all parties angry with the ruling party or the opposition Congress are also ready to surround the government on the issue of inflation
 aise main sarkaar ne bhi niyamon kii duhai dekar vipaksh kii maang thukraa di he
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal has said that we are ready for debate but after seeing his demand, it seems that he does not want to debate, however, the time after the President's speech is of the motion of thanks but by looking at the opposition's tone It seems that the way of government will not be easy in the budget session

 ' isse pehle bijepi kii aalochana karne par bhi yashavanth sinha ko lagaataar twitor par trol kiya jaataa rahaa he

 According to the survey, there is not much difference between the two parties

 In such a situation, BJP does not want to leave any shortfall

 The Election Commission has asked the Election Officer of Amethi Lok Sabha to investigate Janata Party President Subramanian Swamy's allegation that Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi had given false information about his assets while submitting nomination papers for the 2009 general election
 mukhya chunaav adhikari ko 15 november ko bheje patr main ayog ne kaha he ki swami ne aarope lagaaya he ki rahul gandhi ne apni sampatti ke sambandh main galat soochna di thi
 The Commission has cited a letter dated June 2004 stating that the Election Officer is the competent authority to investigate such complaints
 ayog ne apane patr main kaha he, ‘chunki halafanama chunaav adhikari ke samaksh daakhil kiya jaataa he
 Under the provisions of Section 195 of the crpc, the concerned Election Officer can consider any misrepresentation complaint in the affidavit
 ’pradhan sachiv aar ke shrivastav dwaara likhe gaye patr main bhi kaha gaya he ki yadi chunaav adhikari is baat se santusht he ki halafname main galat bayaan he to vah upyukt karrwai kar saktaa he
 The Commission has directed the Chief Election Officer to send Swamy's complaint to the Election Officer (of Amethi) for appropriate action
 chunaav ayog ne kaha he, ‘is maamle main uthaaye jane vaale kadamon kii jaankaree bhi ayog ko di jaae
 Swamy had alleged this month that in the affidavit that Sonia Gandhi had given during the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, she had not disclosed her shares in the Associated Journal which operated the now-closed National Herald

 Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna are among the cool couples in Bollywood
 donon aksar instagram par sweet nokajhonk se bhari post share karte rahete hai
 Twinkle was seen punching Akshay on the occasion of her anniversary in January
 unhone haal hi main soshal media par akshay kumaar kii ek baar phir class lee kyonki unhen ek english verde kaa matlab nahin pataa tha
 Twinkle also told that when he tried to explain the meaning of this word to Akshay, the superstar actor called him Mahakapau
 tvinkal ne instagram par akshay kii tasviir post kii thi
 In this photo, Akshay is seen in black turtle neck tshirt
 tvinkal ne is tasviir ke capshan main likhaa - bhartiya mardon ke liye ek tip - ek blike turtal nek tishart aapako Exponential str par smart bana sakati he bas aap aapke bagal main baithi mahila se iskaa matlab poochne mat lag janaa
 And yes, if you explain the meaning of this word, addressing someone as 'maha Pakau' will not be a profitable deal at all
 gauratlab he ki tvinkal apane sens of humar ke liye jaani jaati rahi hai
 She has been performing her Humor on several chat shows along with Koffee with Karan
 haalanki rajesh khanna or dimple kapaadiya jaise stars kii beti hone ke baavjood unki filmon main khaas ruchi nahin rahi or ve hameshaa se hi kitabon main dilchaspee rakhti thi or bollywood se ritair hone ke baad unhone teen kitaaben likh lee hai
 Akshay and Twinkle have completed 18 years of their marriage in January this year
 a tip for Indian men:a black turtleneck can make most of you seem exponentially smarter-just don’t ask the woman sitting on the other side of your granola what ‘exponentially’ means
 Also it doesn't help if you call the other person'maha Pakau'when they give you the definition

 Talking about the work front, Akshay has started shooting for the film Good News with Kareena Kapoor
 ve iske alaava film kesari ko lekar bhi charchaa main bane hue hai
 He also recently released the poster of this film
 akshay kii ye film 21 march ko release hone ja rahi he
 It is about a middle-class family in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, 1980-90
 is ghar ke mukhiya bhim vaakani theatre company chalaate the or haai skool main teacher bhi the
 When he used to show his jauhar at the theater, his daughter would keep a close watch on father's stage skills
 bacchee kii objarveshan power gajab kii thi
 She often saw her father being upset about the heroines of his plays
 ladakon ko ladkiyaan bananaa padataa tha kyonki us daur main gujarati ladakiyon kaa theatre main aane kaa chalan nahin tha
 The same day the girl thought that she would become the heroine of her father's plays
 vah pita ko aksar kehete sunati ki jis samay jo kaam karo, puraa focus usee par rakho
 Just, he tied this knot
 usne 12veen kii or phir drametics main diploma
 Then also came the day when she worked as a heroine in her father's theater
 vah choti bacchee aaj parade kaa bada naam ban chuki he
 This girl is Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashma Ki Daya Bhabhi aka Disha Vakani
 36 varshiya disha kahati hai, “maine jo siikhaa usamen parivaar kii ahm bhoomika rahi
 Father would sometimes become my friend and sometimes my teacher
 ”disha kaa janm or paalan-poshan ahmedabad main hua
 He has an elder brother (mayur Vakani) and younger sister Khushali
 bahan-bhai padhai bhi karte or pita ke saath theatre main unka man khub ramata
 She started doing drama from the age of four to five
 unke bade bhai mayur (tarak mehta
 
 
 In which he is playing the character of his younger brother Sundar)
 He says that he still remembers the direction of the 80-year-old elder in the children's drama
 unke shabdon main, “disha kii objarveshan power gajab he
 i had a funny incident meri patni hemali alag dhang se “na” kahati he
 i never noticed
 ek din disha kaa naatak dekhne gaya to use stage par alag andaaj main us kairactor ko nibhaate dekha
 As soon as she came, i said that your style of speaking was amazing
 maine poocha, tumne kahaan se siikhaa? to vah hansate hue boli, bhai, bhabhi aise hi bolti he
 He started his struggle for the film world in 1997
 unhone devdas (2002), mangal pandeyh da rising (2005) or jodha akbar (2008) jaisi filmon main chote-mote role kiye
 But luck had something else to accept
 2008 main ek din unki saheli ne unhen bataaya ki production house nila telefilms tarak mehta
 
 
 Is auditioning for disha turant vahaan pahunch gai or audishan de ain
 Asit Kumar Modi, the producer of the serial, says, "many girls gave auditions
 disha ko dekhakar laga ki vahi yah kirdaar nibhaa paaengi
 When he made a voice of Dayaben and laughed, i was completely convinced at that time
 ”apni alag aawaaj or hansi kaa shrey ve apane mimicri ke gun ko detii hai
 Disha says, "my theater experience and mimicry helped bring life to this character
 ” is tarah safar shuru ho gaya
 At the start of the show, Disha had to make the same voice every day
 ve bataati hai, “roj ek tarah kii aawaaj nikaalnaa aasaan nahin tha
 i had to gargle with salt and turmeric
 ” ab saat saal or 1,700 episod ho chuke hai, or ve in sab baton kii abhyast ho chuki hai
 Not only this, there is also no shortage of his garba lovers
 isse unka naam garba queen pad gaya he
 Salman Khan has also shown direction in Garba
 ve muskaraate hue kahati hai, “garba ke kuch step koreographer ke hai to kuch mere apane hai
 Like the Peacock step is my own
 ”asal main parade par hansmukh yaa logon se turant ghulne-milane vaali dayaa asal jidangi main usase ekadam alag hai
 She talks very seriously
 sharmili hai or agar logon ke bich baithi hon to apni maujuudagi kaa ehsaas nahin hone deteen
 But they get wings as soon as they come in front of the camera
 disha bhi maanati hai ki logon se ghulne-milane main unhen thodaa samay lagata he
 No matter how real life they are, but due to being kind, people start to smile at them
 kai baar aisa hota he ki baat karne se pehle hi teji se hansane lagate hai
 Disha says, "in today's tough environment, you can laugh at someone's face without saying anything
 What can be a big success?" kai maukon par to log poochne lagate hai ki tappu (unka onscreen betaa) kaa admician ho gaya? yah bhi ki popat kii shaadi kab hogi?”pichley saat saal main mili kamyaabi ko dayaa ne sir nahin chadhgaye diya he
 She says this much that no matter how big a person becomes, his hunger is eradicated only by lentils and bread
 tarak mehta
 
 
 Dilip Joshi, who plays her husband Jetha Lal, says, "they are down to earth
" aam taur par maine dekha he ki jab actor femes ho jaataa he to unke andar nakhre aa jate hai
 Today has been seven years since the first day, Disha has never shown respect
 ”aksar jetha laal ke liye gujarati pakwaan banane vaali disha healdi food khaanaa hi pasand karti hai
 This is the reason why his look has not changed a lot in the last seven years
 ve kahati hai, “main yoga jarur karti hum
 And eat a lot of fruits and nuts
 ” padhuya unki hobbi he
 They also watch movies when they get leisure
 agar man kiya to gunaguna bhi leti hai
 The stories related to them are as simple as they are themselves
 ek baar hua yun ki unhen shooting ke liye andheri janaa tha
 It was raining heavily
 driver aayaa nahin or unhen gaadi chalaani aati nahin thi
 Wandered a lot but could not find a taxi and wandering for taxi in the streets, he got very angry and on the same day he vowed to learn to drive a car
 or to or, saadagi bhari disha jab dayaa ban jaati hai to kaaphi khatarnaak bhi ho jaati hai
 This often happens on set
 ek baar to unka belan jetha laal kii naak ke paas se 
 
 
 Had gone through evening lekin set par aise kisse hote rahete hai
 Disha is going to tie the knot soon
 par personal sawaal aane par ekadam khamosh ho jaati hai
 In this way, the kindness seen on the screen disappears and the direction of real life is exposed

 Israel is insisting on taking drastic measures, including military action, while the US is trying to prevent Iran from making bombs by imposing diplomacy and sanctions

 What is against Nitish? JDU may have shown an exit to Jitan Ram Manjhi, but as Chief Minister he was constantly taking all possible steps

 Narendra Modi is such a leader who, despite defeating the elections, does not let his opponents sit peacefully
 do oktober se shuru hue ‘svachh bharat abhiyaan’ main kuch aisa hi dekhne ko mila
 First, he snatched Gandhiji from the Congress and then a broom from the Aam Aadmi Party
 loksabhaa chunaav haarane or gandhiji ke chhine jane ke baad congress ke paas gandhi ke naam par sirf ‘rahul’ bache hai or yahi unki sabase badi samasya he
 Even after this, the Congress seems to be in a much better position than Kejriwal, because even now the Congress has so many mps that they could not make themselves a major opposition party in the Lok Sabha, but formed their own whatsapp group party meeting
 Can do it, while in the Aam Aadmi Party, only mps who can be counted on their toes can be counted so that their party meeting is also in Kejriwal's wagon-r Can

 Sourav Ganguly said, 'the Indian ODI team is very good
 bharat jeet saktaa he yaa nahin yah kahana mushkil hoga lekin bharat ek bada daavedaar hoga
 You cannot underestimate the Indian team
 australia or south africa ke paas fast bolers hai lekin bhartiya team hameshaa se chaunkati rahi he
 India, Australia, Pakistan, South Africa and New Zealand will be the five teams that will be the winning contenders
 ’salaam Cricket kaa live kawarej dekhne ke liye clic karen
 
 
 Aamir Sohail said, 'when you evaluate any team, how many impact players are there
 bhartiya team main aise bahut khilaadi maujuud hai
 Dhoni will just have to concentrate on his bowlers
 australia main gendbaajon ko apane bouns par dhyaan dena hoga
 If Dhoni manages to do this, then no one can stop the Indian team from winning the title
 ’salaam cricket main bole ganguli, dabaav main nahin jhukne vaali indiiske jawaab main madan laal ne kaha, ‘zyaadaatar jab ham baahar jate hai to team kii batting kharaab ho jaati he
 As far as bowling is concerned, our bowlers have done well on foreign pitches
 bhartiya team world cap se pehle vahaan do-teen maheene ke tour par kuch aisa hi tha jab ham 1983 world cap khilne gaye to usase pehle westeindies ke daure se vahaan gaye the
 i suggest bowlers try to take wickets instead of trying to stop runs
 ’world cap se pehle australia main kheli jane vaali lambii siries par saurav ganguli ne bern out kaa sawaal uthaaya
 He said, 'indian team will be there for 3-4 months before the World Cup
 tri siries ke baad team ko apane ghar jane ke liye ek do hafte milane chahie
 Their fatigue will be overcome
 kahin na kahin mujhe ummid he ki bhartiya board aisa karegaa
 On who are the good players in the team, Ganguly said, Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Ambati Rayudu are all good players
 unhone kaha, ‘mere hisaab se yuvaraj or sahvaag 2015 kaa world cap nahin khelenge
 Sehwag is the biggest opener in my eyes
 yuvaraj ek special player he
 Nothing is impossible in cricket but it is very difficult for Yuvraj and Sehwag to return
 ’yuvaraj or sahvaag kii baat par sohail ne kaha, ‘time aapako pakad letaa he
 The Indian team has stroke players
 madhyakram main rohit sharma ek bahut badhiya chwis he jo pari ladkadaane kii sthiti main pari ko aage le jane main sakasham he
 The same thing happened to us
 hamaari team vahaan pehle pahunch gai thi
 But it was burnt out
 1992 world cap main 21 player the
 Imran kept sending the player back one by one
 lekin shuruaati maichon main ye varn out dikhaa bhi
 The team later united
 bhartiya board ko bhi kuch aisa hi karnaa hoga
 The team has to be united
 ek do haar hui to bhi captain main or team main bharosa rakhana hoga
 On a question about the captaincy of Team India, Madan Lal said, "dhoni should not even think of changing
 dhoni kii sabase acchhee baat he ki wo nirnay letaa he
 Dhoni Pool will now know that these are the players who will go to play the World Cup
 dhoni jis number par batting karata he wo sabase mahatvapurn he
 It would be best to encourage them
 ’haara hue match main jeet dilaa sake aise koun se players hai yah poochne par ganguli ne kaha, ‘shikhar dhawan, suresh raina, dhoni, viraat kohli ye sabhi match vinar hai
 We have never had bowlers like Akram and Waqar
 hamaare strength fast bolers kabhi nahin rahe hai
 The batsmen of our team have been winning and it is necessary to trust them
 pich kaa mizaaj aap badal nahin sakate
 a different bounce occurs in Australia
 unki condishan aap badal nahin sakate
 We saw a turn during the Champions Trophy in England during May
 ham aashcharyachakit ho gaye ki england main aisa kaise ho rahaa he
 We should make our preparations considering the bounce of the pitch
 ’is par sohail ne kaha, ‘akram or vakaar kachche the jab wo aae the, unhen imran ne narchar kiya
 India's weakness has been bowling, change the mindset that India cannot have fast bowlers
 unhen paristhiti ke anusaar dhaale jane kii jarurat he
 Dhoni's mindset is such that when asked by the fast bowler to put on the tip, Madan Lal said, "bowling is a very important department
 bhubaneshwar, umesh yadav achche gendbaaj hai
 Our spinners are also very good
 condishan main dhalane kii jarurat he
 How quickly you adapt to the condition is important
 ’viraat kohli pressure ko kaise handle karenge yah poochne par saurav ganguli ne kaha, ‘jab aap shuru karte hai to bade players ke saath khelte hai
 Now the pressure is on him, he has handled it well, he has scored 20 centuries
 wo duniya ke har kone main shatak laga chuke hai
 Virat has the ability to win the match, he will be watched by everyone and he is sure that he will do well
 ’spinners kaa team main kya role hoga yah poochne par aamir sohail ne kaha, ‘captain apane bolers ko atake ke liye istemaal karata he or australia-newjaland main uske liye leg spinner ko team main rakhana hoga
 Amit Mishra is a good option for this in the Indian team
 ‘ madan laal ne isapar kaha, ‘aswin or ravindra jadeja ko team main jagah di jaani chahie
 Who will be the top three teams to win the 2015 World Cup? When asked, Aamir Sohail said, 'south Africa and Australia teams are on the same rank
 dakshin africa ne ab spinneron ko istemaal karnaa sikh liya he
 According to the condition, both these teams are on par
 haalanki australia ko thodaa age dete hue number van daavedaar maanata hum
 Indian team is at number three
 ’unhone world cap ke daavedaaron main pakistani team ko rakhe jane kii kisi bhi sambhaavna se inkaar karte hue kaha, ‘pakistan kii team itani acchhee nahin he
 They are not even in the claim
 vahi ladke hai jo baar baar vaapasi karte hai wo bhi bina kisi badlaav ke
 Bowling is not special and the captaincy is not decided yet
 ’seshan ke ant main ajay jadeja shaamil hue or unhone kaha, ‘jab team hi tay nahin he to usapar yah kahana bada mushkil he
 All of us Indians hope that we will win but it will probably be captain Dhoni but there is no address of the team
 agar yahi team ja rahi he to mujhe ummid nahin he ki ham world cap jeetenge
 If Sehwag, Yuvraj are in the team, then things will be different
 ’ajay jadeja ne yah kehete hue ki selectors or captain ke bich sab kuch thik nahin chal rahaa ek vivaad ko janm de diya
 He said, 'the selection team chooses something but the captain's team is different
 meraa maananaa he ki ek team kaa ek hi leader hona chahie
 If Dada (pointing to Ganguly) is not given the player he wants in the team, then how can he win the match
 ’aamir sohail ne bhi team sellection kii badi bhoomika maanate hue kaha, ‘sellection cameti ke paas plan hona chahie
 After that they talk to the captain
 amuman ek duusare se baatcheet ke baad hi team chuni jaati he
 Here i believe that 60% of the captain's talk in team selection must be accepted
 ’jadeja ne kaha, ‘mere hisaab se team kisi honi chahie yah nahin matlab rakhata
 The team should be according to Dhoni
 ab aapako maukey dene kaa time nahin he, unhen (players ko) ab taiyaar karnaa chahie ki jaao world cap jeet kar lao
 During this discussion, cricketer Murali Karthik, who was present in the audience gallery, also agreed with Jadeja's words and said, "I would like to go with Jadeja
" team india main players achche hai lekin match vinar nahin hai

 'on the suggestion of some Congress leaders that there can be only one Father of the Nation, Singh said that for this the Congress will have to cross-examine Trump

 This time the budget will be increased to improve the sick, decaying infrastructure
 lekin ab tak aae do bajet to bitta bhar bhi nahin bade
 See this time, Modi's mind will be reflected in the budget or this time too
 
 
 baat kareeb do saal pehle kii he jab pradhanmantri narendra modi ‘mental health’ ko lekar lagbhag centemental ho gaye the
 However, a report from the World Health Organization made him restless
 report thi ki 2006-2016 ke bich avsaad ke maamle 18 fisadi kii dar se bade hai
 In this report, India was said to be close to the danger mark
 agar neshnal family health survey kii 2016-17 kii report dekhen to khatra or or badha mahasoos hoga
 600 million people in the country suffer from some form of mental illness
 yani 6
 5 percent of the citizens are suffering from mental illness
 neshnal institute of mental health and neurosience ke 2017 kii report dekhen to yah aankada 13
 8 percent
 saal 2020 tak yah aankada badhkar 20 fisadi ho jayega
 Today every sixth person of the country is struggling with some kind of depression
 pradhanmantri ji ke man ko is report ne baari kar diya
 In the 'mann ki Baat' program, Modi ji lightened the issue by raising this issue
 pradhanmantri ji ne ‘depressant se ubarne ke liye muft main salaah di
 He said, "my dear countrymen, the first mantra to overcome depression is not to talk to anyone about the causes of depression, so don't press it
 '' koi bhi manja hue manovaigyanik bhi yahi salaah detaa ki man main dabi shikaayatein or gussa jab charam par pahunch jaataa he to avsaad panapata he
 Therefore do not forcefully suppress anger, express it openly
 counselling ke dauraan manorogi ko counslar sabase pehali salaah bhi yahi detaa he
 In common parlance, it can also be called outburst
 lekin kya avsaad grast koi vyakti itani aasaani se apane man kii baat kisi ko bataata he? avsaad jis str kaa hoga utana hi jor counslar ko manorogi ke man kii baat ugalvaane main lagegaa
 If depression is severe, then 2-3 sessions, then the patient just stares
 agar avsaad ke shuruaati str main he to pehle yaa duusare seshan main hi vyathit vyakti apni pidaa jaahir karata he
 But are there so many psychologists in India who can free themselves from depression, anxiety, nervousness and instability? Or can the diseases that have reached a serious level, such as schizophrenia, paranoia, get rid of the divisive diseases? Is the government of the country having enough budget to improve the health of the countrymen suffering from mental illnesses? Without adequate infrastructure, will the mental health of the country be improved by Modi ji's mind? And in the end, what infrastructure will be able to improve without budget? At present, only 0 of health budget
 07 fisadi hi maansik swasthya ke liye abhi tak kharch kiya ja rahaa he
 Now look at the health budget too
 yah mahaj puure bajet kaa 2 fisadi hi he
 Where the country's mental health is in danger, what good will it do to the budget? Only 0 in India per one lakh psychiatrists
 30 manochikitsak, 0
 17 nurses, 0
 05 manovaigyanik hai
 Please appreciate them! In December last year, a person was seen tied with chains in the intersection of a town in Banda district of Uttar Pradesh
 vahaan ke ek samajasevi ne us vyakti se baatcheet kar use ghar tak pahunchaaya
 The family members said that it gets violent again and again
 isliye sajaa dene ke liye gharavaalon ne use kadakati thand main chauraahey ke bichon-bich railing se zanjeeron se baandh diya tha
 People would move forward after seeing him
 log ise bhoot-pret kii baadha maanakar chupchaap vahaan se nikal ja rahe the
 Rita Sethi, who runs the country's first day care for people suffering from severe mental illness in Gurgaon, says on the basis of the case studies of such people present in a hi-fi area like Gurgaon, "such cruel views of villagers" It is still visible in India
 haa shaharon main log maansik beemaari se jujh rahe logon ko chauraahon main to nahin magar ghar ke kisi kone main jarur kaidakar rakhte hai
 "we tell," We have freed many psychiatrists around Gurgaon from chains, many of whom have seen light years later
 ’’aise main jab pradhanmantri ne do saal pehle ‘man kii baat’ main depressant ke mudde ko uthaaya to bharosa jaagaa ki shaayad ab desh kii maansik sehat sudhar jaaegi
 But when the budget was presented, hope fell flat
 kyonki bajet main koi badhotaree nahin thi
 Now once again when the budget is about to be presented, in such a situation, if the citizens of the country are suffering from mental illness, if they wake up with an emotion regarding mental health, then how surprised? Hujoor! This time, please do not give advice and pay attention to the health of the mental health budget, which is suffering from malnutrition

 It is reported that actor Randeep Hooda has demanded a hefty amount of 11 crores to do a film on Sarabjit's life, so it is possible that Randeep Hooda should be left out of this film
 randeep hooda sarbajit kii jindagi par banane vaali film main sarbajit singh kii bhoomika nibhaane vaale the, jo galati se sarhad paar hue or 20 saal tak pakistan kii jail main band rahe or aakhirkaar usee jail main kisi kaidi ne sarbajit par aisa jaanaleva hamalaa kiya ki unki jaan chali gai
 By the way, since the announcement of this film, many changes have been made since then
 sabase pehle to kangana ranavat film se baahar huin jo sarbajit kii bahan kii bhoomika nibhaane vaali thim or kangana kii jagah is film main aishwarya raay kii entry kii khabar ai
 The director of this film changed after that
 pehle is film ko 'shahid' film se charchaa main aae nirdeshak hansal mehta diarect karne vaale the, magar baad main hansal baahar hue or film ke nirdesan kii jimmedaari saunpi gai film 'mericom' ke nirdeshak omang kumaar ke haathon main
 The comments ab khabar aa rahi he ki sarbajit kii bhoomika nibhaane ke liye randeep hooda 11 karod rupee maang rahe hai
 It is also being discussed that the filmmakers are still talking to Randeep and if he agrees to take the remuneration according to the budget of the film, then he can remain a part of this film
 lekin ek sawaal uthta he ki randeep ne agar 11 karod kii maang kii to kyon kii? kyonki kabhi kabhi actors kaa jab man nahin hota kisi film ko karne kaa tab wo ootpataang paise maangate hai taaki nirmaataa film karne ke liye unka baar baar peechha na kare or agar vaaki main randeep ne 11 karod maange hai to kya ye jaij mehtaanaa he, kyonki randeep ke naam par koi film 11 karod kaa bijanas nahin kar paati box offis par
 Randeep Hooda was to play the role of Sarabjit Singh in the film on Sarabjit's life, who accidentally crossed the border and remained in a Pakistani jail for 20 years and finally a prisoner in the same jail attacked Sarabjit with such a fatal attack She lost her life
 vaise aapako bataa den kii is film kii jab se ghoshnaa hui he, tab se kai badlaav ho chuke hai
 First of all, Kangana Ranaut dropped out of the film to play the role of Sarabjit's sister and Aishwarya Rai's entry in the film came in place of Kangana
 uske baad is film ke nirdeshak badale
 Earlier, director Hansal Mehta, who was in discussion with the film 'shahid', was to direct, but later Hansal was out and in the hands of Omung Kumar, the director of the film 'mary Kom', who was given the responsibility of directing the film
 tippaniyan Now the news is coming that Randeep Hooda is asking for Rs 11 crore to play the role of Sarabjit
 saath hi ye bhi charchaa ho rahaa he ki ab bhi filmkaar randeep se baatcheet kar rahe hai or agar wo film ke bajet ke anusaar mehtaanaa lene ko raji hue to wo is film kaa hissaa rah sakate hai
 But a question arises that if Randeep asked for 11 crores, why did he? Because sometimes when actors do not feel like doing a film, then they ask extravagantly money so that the producer does not chase them repeatedly to do the film and if Randeep has really asked for 11 crores, is it justified, because No film in the name of Randeep could do business of 11 crores at the box office
 vaise aapako bataa den kii is film kii jab se ghoshnaa hui he, tab se kai badlaav ho chuke hai
 First of all, Kangana Ranaut dropped out of the film to play the role of Sarabjit's sister and Aishwarya Rai's entry in the film came in place of Kangana
 uske baad is film ke nirdeshak badale
 Earlier, director Hansal Mehta, who was in discussion with the film 'shahid', was to direct, but later Hansal was out and in the hands of Omung Kumar, the director of the film 'mary Kom', who was given the responsibility of directing the film
 tippaniyan Now the news is coming that Randeep Hooda is asking for Rs 11 crore to play the role of Sarabjit
 saath hi ye bhi charchaa ho rahaa he ki ab bhi filmkaar randeep se baatcheet kar rahe hai or agar wo film ke bajet ke anusaar mehtaanaa lene ko raji hue to wo is film kaa hissaa rah sakate hai

 ab khabar aa rahi he ki sarbajit kii bhoomika nibhaane ke liye randeep hooda 11 karod rupee maang rahe hai
 It is also being discussed that the filmmakers are still talking to Randeep and if he agrees to take the remuneration according to the budget of the film, then he can remain a part of this film
 lekin ek sawaal uthta he ki randeep ne agar 11 karod kii maang kii to kyon kii? kyonki kabhi kabhi actors kaa jab man nahin hota kisi film ko karne kaa tab wo ootpataang paise maangate hai taaki nirmaataa film karne ke liye unka baar baar peechha na kare or agar vaaki main randeep ne 11 karod maange hai to kya ye jaij mehtaanaa he, kyonki randeep ke naam par koi film 11 karod kaa bijanas nahin kar paati box offis par

 siries kaa pehla match shanivaar ko khelaa jayega
 The last time Team India faced Sri Lanka was in the Asia Cup
 salaami ballebaaj gautam gambhir ne us match main 100 or up-captain viraat kohli ne 108 ranon kii jabardast pari kheli thi
 If this attitude of the Indian batsmen remains intact in Sri Lanka, then it will be a great opportunity for Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team to reach the top in one-day but for this the Indian team will have to whitewash Sri Lanka
 paanch maichon kii siries kaa har match jeetna hoga
 It will not be easy to defeat Sri Lanka by 5–0 on his ground
 vaise, bharat ne srilanka main pichhali do siries jiti hai jisase jeet kii ummid banati he
 The comments gauratlab he ki 2008 main mahendra singh dhoni kii team ne 3−2 se siries jiti thi
 Dhoni had scored two half-centuries in that series and was also the man of the series
 2009 main bharat ne srilanka ko 4−1 se haraaya tha

 India is at number four with 117 points
 agar bharat sabhi paanch match jeet letaa he to vah 120 ankon ke saath top par pahunch jayega

 - patna ke new dak bangala road muhalle main bijepi ke prachaar control room kii bahari diwaar par muskaraate narendra modi kii adamkad tasviir maano dekh rahi he
 Inside the headset, people are constantly talking on microphones sitting in their cubicles
 unheen main ek, blue genes or bhure rang kii kameez pahane kareeb 20 saal ke ashish kumaar gaya jile main ek bijepi video vine ke oparator se jaankariyaan le rahe hai
 They are asking, "how many people came when Modi ji's speech was recorded? What was his reaction?" How many stickers and Modi masks were distributed? Are generators and LED screens working? " And after every question, they stop for a while
 bijepi video rath main unke saathiyon ke paas mobile phone ap he jisase minuton main tasviren or bheed kii sankhya kii jaankaree control room main pahunch jaati he
 This information is matched with the video tracking device of the chariot to provide accurate information in the control room immediately
 bijepi ne bihar kii sabhi 40 loksabhaa siton ke liye yah electronic prachaar abhiyaan shuru kiya he
 Five years ago, BJP was the junior partner of Nitish Kumar
 use 15 sansadeey siten di gai thim jisamen usne 12 par jeet darj kii
 But in 2014, BJP is ahead on the front
 vah bihar main 30 siton par chunaav lard rahi he
 Says a senior party leader, "the electoral contest in Bihar has been just Lalu versus Nitish since 1995
 isliye jab ham 2009 ke apane vot pratishat 13
 Can take 93 percent to 30 percent then only 20 or more seats out of 40 can win
 iske liye jamkar koshish karne kii jarurat he
 "there is a two-pronged strategy for bjp's campaign in Bihar
" ek, party ke bihar prabharee dharmendra pradhan or vidhayak dal ke netaa susheel kumaar modi ne ek nai soshal ejineering karne kii koshish kii he
 They have tried to mobilize the backward castes and create new social equations by keeping religious symbols separate
 duusare, party ne patna ke apane kendriya control room ke jariye vyapak chunaav prabandhan vyavastha banaai he jise rajyasabha saansad aar
 K
 sinha or unke bete ruturaj sanchalit karte hai
 There are contacts between the Prime Leaders and the Backroom Boys
 in donon ranneetiyon kaa asar jameen par dikh rahaa he
 a small network of party partners including the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) is also proving effective in taking this new social equation forward
 algepi netaa ramvilas paswan or rashtriya lok samta party ke obisi netaa upendra kushvaha jitna bhi dalit or pichhadaa vot khinchenge, vah nitish kumaar ke janata dal-united (jedy-you) ke paale se hi aayega
 Kushwaha, Nitish's former aide, has a good penetration, especially among the Koiri caste
 1994 main lalu prasad yadav ke rashtriya janata dal (argedy) se tuutakar samta party ke gathan ke samay se hi koiri or kurmi nitish kaa mukhya aadhaar rahe hai
 Both of these are OBC castes
 kushvaha or paswan bihar main bijepi ke vistaar main bhi kaam aaenge or bijepi kii sweekaaryata anya vaicharik aadhaar vaale dalon ke bich bhi badhegi jise nitish ne modi ke aane ke baad rajnatik achhut bataa diya tha
 The BJP has left seven Lok Sabha seats for Paswan and three for Kushwaha
 bihar main saamaajik vistaar kii bijepi kii yojana nai nahin he lekin isaki ummid kam thi ki vah bihar ke jati vibhajit samaaj ko or baantegi
 In the 1970s, veteran socialist leader Karpoori Thakur took the concept of backward castes to the concept of reservation within the possible reservation for backward castes
 lalu prasad yadav ne ’90 ke dashak main iskaa apane phaayde ke liye istemaal kiya or baad main nitish ne ati pichhadon ke liye panchayaton main 20 pratishat kaa aarakshan dekar ise or dhardaar banaaya
 Nitish dented Lalu's backward-muslim-yadav and Paswan's Dalit vote banks by running welfare programs targeted at marginalized sections of the backward communities
 unke virdohi kuch harakat main aate, uske pehle hi nitish mahaj 3
 8 percent became extremely powerful from the leader of the Kurmis
 phir unhen bijepi ke oonchi jatiyon ke vot bank kaa bhi aadhaar mil gaya
 In the Lok Sabha elections, the former ally BJP is trying social engineering through its allies against casteist, not the country
 party ke ek varisht ranneetikaar bataate hai, ''jatiyon main bante bihar ke samaaj main 'desh pehle’ kaa najariya vot nahin dilaaegaa
 We have to present the cut of Nitish and Lalu's caste politics and that is what we are doing
 ” ranneeti sidhi-si he: vibhinn jatiyon kaa ek nayaa saamaajik gathjod taiyaar karo, iskaa istemaal chunavi bahumat paane ke liye karo, or phir ise sthaayee saamaajik samarthan aadhaar main badalo
 The impact of caste in Bihar's politics is so effective that in his speeches here Modi is describing himself as a backward caste to attract all OBC castes including Yadavs
 party ne un logon ko shaamil karne se gurej nahin kiya jo iske dhur virdohi rahe hai, jaise rajyasabha main argedy ke saansad ramkripal yadav ko patliputra main lalu kii beti misa ke khilaaf khadaa kiya gaya he
 "the only qualification is the ability to win," says a BJP leader
 ”lalu or nitish bhi modi ke jawaab main apni garibi ke dinon kii yaad dilaate hai
 Lalu reminds the voters that they too used to sell tea and goat milk, so Nitish is describing himself as a 'very modest man' and 'the son of a modest Vaidya of the village'
 haalanki bijepi kii send lagane kii koshishon ke baavjood nitish apane atipichhadaa vot bank kaa bada hissaa bachaa le ja sakate hai
 Lalu may also be successful in mobilizing the Yadavs in his favor, but they may not get this vote for their ally Congress
 bijepi bhi apane mul aadhaar oonchi jati ke bhoomihaar or brahmïnon ko apane paksh main banaae rakhane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Here, in Patna's call center, Ashish Kumar starts to laugh when told from the other side that the villagers insist on playing the recorded speech again and again
 biessi ke tisare varsh ke chaatr ashish kii tarah kareeb 100 logon ko bijepi ne apane bihar prachaar ke liye 100 din kaa kaam diya he
 His team works in two shifts for eight hours every day
 unka kaam mukhya rup se video vine or walantiaron ke network kii nigaraanee karnaa he jinhen party disambar se hi vibhinn str par istemaal kar rahi he
 Mobile Message a video van stops at seven places every day in a total of 243 assembly constituencies of the state, and everywhere a video of Modi's 25-minute speech is played on the giant LED screen
 bhaashan kaa saar yah hota he ki kaise modi bihar ko vikaas kii dagar par le janaa chaahate hai
 He talks about the huge water resources of Bihar and questions why the state then has to procure fish from Andhra Pradesh
 pichley saal tak bejod mukhyamantri maane jane vaale nitish ab akelaapan mahasoos kar rahe hai
 a senior JD (U) leader says, "his biggest worry is not the Lok Sabha elections, but the ominous shadow of his government
" ” jedy(you) ke 243 sadasyeey vidhansabha main 115 vidhayak hi hai
 The chief minister has given BJP mlas Santosh Kumar and Avinash Kumar Singh a Lok Sabha ticket and reduced the bjp's strength in the assembly by asking these people to resign from the assembly membership
 iske alaava do duusare bijepi vidhayak amarnath gami or vijay mishra bhi shaayad nitish ke khilaaf vot na karen
 Similarly, ljp's only MLA Zakir Hussain Khan also joined JD (U) in February
 iske alaava 13 argedy vidhayakon main chaar vidhayak vidhansabha main alag gut ke rup main chinhit hai, ve bhi argedy main laute nahin hai
 This controversial initiative brought relief to the minority government
 is tarah sadan kii kul sankhya philhal 237 ho gai or sarkaar ko chaar congress vidhayakon, chaar nirdaleey or ek sipii vidhayak kaa samarthan hasil he
 Nitish has faith in his backward-mahadalit-pasmanda Muslim vote bank
 unki sabase badi chunauti votaron ko apni praasangikta kaa bharosa dilaanaa he
 His sudden claim is a recipe for equalization with Modi that he is more qualified to become Prime Minister than someone who does not spend a single day in Parliament
 chaara ghotaale main doshi qaraar die gaye lalu prasad ne patni rabari devi ko saaran se khadaa kiya he, jahaan se ve 2009 main jite the
 Since being released on bail, he has addressed more meetings than Nitish and Paswan
 ve musalamaanon kaa bharosa jeetne kii koshish kar rahe hai jo congress-argedy-ensipi gathjod or nitish ke bich jhul rahe hai
 The RJD alliance has fielded eight Muslims and 10 Yadav candidates to regain the Lalu's well-known MV (muslim-yadav) alliance
 ek varisht yadav netaa party kii ranneeti ke bare main bataate hai, ''yah jaananaa jaruri he ki koun-sa samooh aapke liye vot nahin karegaa
 It is useless to waste time on such groups
 ”lalu yaa nitish apana janaadhar tuutane kaa khatra mahasoos kar rahe honge, vahiin paswan ne modi kaa daaman thaamne se khud ko or majbootee milane kii ummid kii hogi
 Through its allies, BJP is now using strategic social engineering against Nitish
 * manyata he ki is din pitaron ke naam par kaale kapade daan karne chahie
 * It is also considered good to donate black food items
 * kehete hai ki is din jaruratmandon ko daan karnaa bahut punya dilaataa he
 * It is said that when Shanidev is happy, the ancestors are also happy and calm
 * manyata he ki shani kii dhaatu loha he
 That is why Shanidev is pleased by donating grains with iron
 * shanivaar ko chanaa or urad kii daal kaa daan karne kii bhi manyata he

 It has been believed for a long time that married couples should fulfill all their responsibilities together
 haal ke dashakon main yah dharna bhi majboot hui he ki purushon ko bhi gharelu kaamkaaj main mahilaon kii madad kerani chahie
 But the conclusion of new research is something that you can hardly believe
 shodh kaa labboluab yah he ki agar aap talaak se bachanaa chaahate hai, to phir sabhi gharelu kaamkaaj patni ko hi karne den
 This study may be troubling to advocates of gender equality, but researchers have found that 'modern' couples who are involved in household chores have higher divorce rates
 duusari ore, ghar ke kaamkaaj kii sari jimmedaari jin gharon main mahilaayein uthaati hai, vahaan algaav kii dar kam he
 In a study conducted in Norway, it has been found that the rate of divorce is found to be 50 per cent higher among the couples who share an equal share in domestic work rather than just women
 shodh report main kaha gaya he ki kai baar ghar or baahar pati-patni kii bhoomika ko lekar spashtataa kaa abhaav rahata he
 Therefore, both should not be hindered in each other's work
 pramukh shodhakarta thomas hensen ne kaha, ‘yadi ghar ke kaam ko donon mil-julkar karenge, to donon main jhagada adhik hoga, kyonki donon ek-duusare se apane apane hisaab se kaam karana chahenge
 'they said,' Women are also highly educated and earn well in modern couples, which reduces their dependence on their spouse
 aise main gharelu kaamkaaj ko lekar jhagada hota he, to ve talaak lene ke baad bhi aaraam se guzaara kar sakati hai

 anna hajaare ne apni team ko bhang kar diya he
 This decision was taken in the meeting after the end of the fast
 anna ne apane blog main yah saaf kar diya he ki ab koi anshan nahin hoga
 At the same time, Anna has written that he will now tour across the country
 padhein anna kaa blog:janalokapal kanoon sarkaar banane ke liye raji nahin he
 How long will you keep on fasting again and again
 ab anshan chodo or desh kii janata ko vikalp de do
 More and more people raised this demand
 maine bhi sochaa aaj kii sarkaar se desh kaa bhrashtachar kam nahin ho saktaa
 The reason is not the intention of the government
 janalokapal kanoon se bhrashtachar dur hoga
 This was the hope of the countrymen
 lekin dedh saal biit gaye
 Despite repeated agitations, the government is not ready to bring Janlokpal law
 achche logon ko khoj karke janata ko vikalp dena
 This is a good way
 aisa mujhe laga
 But how will it happen? This is the question before me
 mujhe vikalp dene kii baat karne vaale logon ke saamne jantar mantar par khuleam maine ek prashn khadaa kiya
 You talk about options
 main deshbhar main daure karuunga
 i will make people aware, i have a good ethic, a national outlook, a social outlook, a sense of service
 Such people will not go to Parliament till then there will be no change
 yah baat mujhe manjuur he lekin-1
 What would be the way to search for such people? 2
 vikalp dene ke liye party banani hogi
 What would be the way to choose a party member when creating that party? 3
 aaj adhikansh party board lagaati hai
 The work of Sashad Nodani (registration) is in progress
 bhrashtachari ho, gunda ho, vyabhaachari ho, lutaaru ho inako na dekhte hue bhi sabhasad banaati he
 What will happen to this movement if we create such councilors? 4
 main khud koi paksh-party main nahin banaaungaa
 i will not contest elections
 lekin janata ke saamne vikalp dene ke liye jarur prayaas karuunga
 5
 aaj ek chunaav ke liye 10 se 15 karod rupye se bhi zyada kharchaa hota he
 From where will we get so much money to give options to the country? 6
 chunaav main chunakar aane ke baad unki buddhi kaa palat ho gaya to kya vikalp he? kaaran, janata chunakar dete samay acha ummidavaar he yah samajhakar hi chunakar detii he
 But the chair has the quality of religion that many people's intellects are overturned and due to selfishness they start committing corruption
 jaise aaj kai partiyon main dikhaai de rahaa he
 What about that? What is the way of monitoring such people? 7
 aaj pakruti or maanavtaa kaa dohan ho rahaa he or sarkaar use nahin roak rahi
 This is a big danger for the country
 kya vikalp hoga?8
 Thousands of people who came to Jantar Mantar were asked by the team whether they should be given the option or not and everyone raised their hands
 ye acchhee baat he
 But Jantar Mantar is not just a country
 desh bahut bada he
 It is also important to take their opinion
 meri apeksha he
 There are 6 lakh villages in the country
 in sabhi gaanv kii gramsabha kii gramsabhaaon ne apana suzav paarit karnaa he ki ham vikalp maangate he
 Therefore, we send the suggestion of our gram sabha to you that good people go to Parliament
 gramsabha sambhav nahin he vahaan par vyakti ne farm par hastakshar karke kehane he ki ham vikalp ke liye taiyaar he
 9
 jis prakaar gaanv main gramsabha kaa suzav hoga usee prakaar nagar parishad, nagarpalika, mahapalika main ward sabha or mohalla sabha kaa bhi suzav karnaa hoga
 It will be clear then that the public is ready to send good people to the Lok Sabha
 aisa hota he to main agle deb saal desh main safar karuunga or deshavaasiyon ko jagaaungaa
 i will appeal to the public to search for a candidate to send to the Lok Sabha
 khoj hone ke baad unka seva bhav, charitra, raashtra prem, unka kaary uski mantering ke liye hamaare kaaryakarta jaaege
 Will examine them
 uske baad chayan hoga
 i have done this experiment in Maharashtra
 vidhansabha ke 12 log maine chune the
 8 people came out of it
 maine sansad main acha ummidavaar bhejne kaa vikalp dene kii baat karte hi kai logon ne ghoshnaa kii ki anna zero ban gaye
 i am already zero, live in the temple, neither money nor wealth, nor any position, still sit on the ground and eat plain vegetable-bread
 pehle se hi zero he or aakhir tak zero rahoonga
 What will make those who already have zero? Whomever i want to say keeps saying, i don't mind
 ajtak 25 saal main meri badanaami karne ke liye kam se kam 5 kitaaben likhi gai
 Many newspaper people have written (editorials) for notoriety
 lekin faqir aadmi kii faqiri kam nahin hui
 What is the joy of this faqi? People who commit this slander will have to become Faqir even understandable
 ek baat acchhee hui kii jitani meri ninda hui
 Equally, the power to serve the people and the country grew
 aaj 75 saal kii umr main bhi utana hi utsaah he jitna 35 saal pehle kaam karte vakt tha
 In order to reduce the corruption of the country, there were many agitations to get Janlokpal law made
 4 baar anshan hue
 But the government is not ready to accept, so the team decided to stop the fast and give the option
 sarkaar se janalokapal kii maang kaa andolan ruk gaya lekin andolan samaapt nahin hua he
 First the Janlokpal kept demanding the law from the government
 sarkaar nahin karti isliye janata se hi achche log chunakar sansad main bhejnaa or janalokapal banane kaa andolan shuru karne kaa nirnay ho gaya
 If the people supported the party for one and a half years, if it continues, then the elected people of the people will send to the Parliament
 or janalokapal, rhite tu riject, gramsabha ko adhikaar, rhite tu ricol jaise kanoon banavaayenge
 And in the coming 5 years, we will build a corruption-free India with public participation, not from the party and the party
 2014 kaa chunaav bhrashtachar mukt desh banane ke liye janata ke liye aakhri mauka he
 It is difficult to get such an opportunity again after this election
 kaaran, is vakt desh jaag gaya he
 Now or never
 maine baar-baar bataaya he ki meraa jivan samaaj or desh seva main arpan kiya he
 If the public is not supported at this time, the loss will not be of Anna
 anna to ek faqir he or marate dam tak wo faqir hi rahegaa
 i have given the option of choosing good people and sending them to Parliament
 lekin main paksh-party main shaamil nahin hounga
 i will not contest elections also
 janata ko janalokapal kaa kanoon dekar main maharashtra main apane kaary main phir se lagunga
 i have also told the people who removed the party
 party banane ke baad bhi yah andolan hi rahe
 In the first movement, Janlokpal was demanding law from the government
 ab andolan jari rakhte hue janata ke sahyog se achche logon ko chunaav main khadaa karke sansad main bhejo or kanoon banaao
 There should be no power in the heart and mind, there should be no reason for the rule, consider this to be a service to the countrymen
 agar satta or paisa dimag main aa gaya to duusari paksh-party or apni party main koi fark nahin rahegaa
 The day i see that the service to the society of the country has gone away and only power and money are being tried
 usee din main ruk jaaoongaa
 i will not move forward kyonki maine samaaj or desh kii bhalaai ke liye vikalp dene kaa sochaa he
 My life is for his own good
 aaj team anna kaa kaary ham logon ne samaapt kiya he
 Team Anna was formed for the work of Jan Lokpal
 sarkaar se sambandh nahin rakhane kaa nirnay liya he
 Due to this, the work called Team Anna has started from today and now the Team Anna Committee has also ended
 samaajawaadee party main pichley kuch dinon se chal rahi uthal puthal par kendriya swasthya evam parivaar kalyaan rajya mantri or apana dal kii netaa anupriya patel ne nishaanaa saadhaa he

 anupriya ne kaha ki pradesh kii janata ko ab samaajawaadee party ke bahekaave main nahin aana chahie
 Anupriya Patel, who reached Sitapur, said that during the four-and-a-half-year tenure of the SP government, illegal possession and illegal mining have been dominating

 In the year 1896, the first modern Olympic Games started on 6 April
 par iske peeche kaa master mind koun tha or kis vajah se olympic khelon kii shuruyaat kii gai
 Know 
 
 pracheen kaal main shanti ke samay yoddhaon ke bich pratispardhaa ke saath khelon kaa vikaas hua
 Races, boxing, wrestling and chariots were part of military training
 inamen se sabase behatar pradarshan karne vaale yoddha pratispardhi khelon main apana damakham dikhaate the
 According to the news agency 'RIA Novosti', the birthday of Parveen Babi, lost in memories, the ancient Olympic Games were organized 1200 years ago among the warriors and sportspersons
 haalanki olympic kaa pehla aadhikarik aayojan 776 isa purv main hua tha, jabaki aakhri baar iskaa aayojan 394 isvi main hua
 After this, it was banned by the Emperor Theodosis of Rome, calling it an idolatrous festival
 shuru ho rahaa he duniya kaa sabase bada khel aayojan rio olympic 2016iske baad lagbhag dedh sau saalon tak in khelon ko bhula diya gaya
 However, in the medieval period there were different types of competition among the elite
 lekin inhen khel aayojan kaa darja nahin mil sakaa
 Overall, in the absence of sovereign civilizations like Rome and Greece, people did not have time for sports during this period
 india today # mindrocks16 main boleen sakshi malik- rio ke bronj medal ne badal di meri duniya19veen shatabdi main europe main sarvamaanya sabhyataa ke vikaas ke saath puraatan kaal kii is parampara ko phir se jinda kiya gaya
 The credit for this goes to Pierre de Kuvertain, the nobleman of France
 kuvarten ne do lakshya rakhe, ek to khelon ko apane desh main lokapriy bananaa or doosraa, sabhi deshon ko ek shantipurna pratispardhaa ke liye ekatrit karnaa
 Loved by three people, but unmarried throughout his life, Parveen Bobikuvarten believed that sports could be the best means of avoiding wars
 kuvarten kii is pariklpana ke aadhaar par varsh 1896 main pehali baar aadhunik olympic khelon kaa aayojan greece kii rajdhani athens main hua
 In the early decade, the Olympic movement struggled to save its existence because Kuvarthen's hypothesis could not be supported by any major power
 14 deshon ke 241 khiladiyon ne in khelon main bhaag liya
 43 events from 9 sports took place in this Olympics
 37,40,000 drackemas (unani karency) kharch hue in khelon ke aayojan main
 Marathon races were also included for the first time in 43 competitions
 6 se 15 april 1896 ke dauraan yunaan kii rajdhani athens main in khelon kaa aayojan hua
 The two editions of the Olympics held in Paris and St
 Louis in 1900 and 1904 could not be popular, as there was a shortage of grand events during this time
 landan main apane chauthe sanskaran ke saath olympic andolan shakti sampann hua
 2000 athletes participated in it
 yah sankhya pichley teen aayojanon ke yoga se adhik thi
 With the Berlin edition of 1930, there was a new vitality in the Olympic movement
 saamaajik or rajnatik str par jari pratispardhaa ke kaaran naajiyon ne ise apni shreshthata sabit karne kaa madhyam bana diya
 Olympic fame peaked as Sindhu was brought to the silver and BMW, Kenya's Goldmedalist's Village Electricity, came to the soviet-america competition in the 1950s
 iske baad to khel kabhi bhi raajnneeti se alag nahin hua
 Sports are not just a matter of politics
 ye raajnneeti kaa ahm hissaa ban gaye
 Because the superpowers like the Soviet Union and America never openly fought each other on the battlefield
 lihaaja unhone olympic ko apni shreshthata sabit karne kaa madhyam bana liya
 Former US President John F
 kennedy ne ek baar kaha tha ki antariksh yaan or olympic swarna padak hi kisi desh kii pratishtha kaa pratik hote hai
 Spacecraft and gold medals emerged as the biggest objectives of the superpowers during the Cold War era
 bade khel aayojan is shanti yuddh kaa ang ban gaye or khel ke maidan yudhsthalon main parivartit ho gaye
 After these changes, India's fortunes will change in the Olympics! The Soviet Union repaid the defeat at the hands of the US in the 1968 Mexico Olympics at the 1972 Munich Olympics
 soviet sangh kii 50veen varshganth par vahaan ke log kisi bhi keemat par america se haarana nahin chaahate the
 As a result, Soviet athletes won a total of 99 medals with 50 gold medals
 yah sankhya america dwaara jite gaye padakon se ek tihaai zyada thi
 In 1980, the US and its allies in the West refused to participate in the 1980 Moscow Olympics
 iske baad hisaab chukaane ke liye soviet sangh ne 1984 ke los anjalis olympic kaa bahishkaar kar diya
 The Soviet Union once again proved its superiority at the 1988 Seoul Olympics
 usne 132 padak jite
 It had 55 golds
 america ko 34 swarna sahit 94 padak mili the
 The US finished third after East Germany
 varsh 1992 ke barsilona olympic main bhi soviet sangh ne apana varchasv kaayam rakhaa
 However, the Soviet Union had disintegrated by that time
 ek sanyukt team ne olympic main hissaa liya tha
 Despite this, he won 112 medals
 isamen 45 swarna the
 America had 108 medals with 37 gold
 saal 1996 ke atlanta or 2000 ke sidney olympic main rus (soviet sangh ke vibhaajan ke baad kaa naam) gaiyr adhikarik ank talika main duusare sthaan par rahaa
 She finished third at the 2004 Athens Olympics
 beijing olympic 2008 ko ab tak kaa sabase acha aayojan mana ja gaya he
 During the Olympic Games that lasted fifteen days, China not only won the hearts of the people with its magnificent hosts but also created history by winning the most gold medals
 pehali baar padak talika main china sabase upar rahaa
 Whereas America had to satisfy itself from the second place
 bharat ne bhi olympic ke itihaas main vyaktigat spardhaon main pehali baar koi swarna padak jeeta or use pehali baar ek saath teen padak bhi mili

 a second case of doping came to light after another Nigerian athlete found positive for the use of the same banned substance at the Commonwealth Games
 kareeb ek din pehle hi ek or nyeegerian athlete is test main pajitive paayi gayi thi
 CGF President Mike Fennell said that hurdles athlete Samuel Okone was found positive for methylhexaamine
 yahi pratibandhit padaarth hamawatan ossayemi oludambo ke namoonay main paaya gaya tha jo mahila 100 me kii swarna padkadhari thi
 Okon finished sixth in the men's 110m hurdles finals

 'he said,' Now a positive case of doping has come up

" ’sijief pramukh ne haalanki is baat se inkaar kiya ki doping team sabhi nyeegerian khilaadiyon kaa test karegi or unhone kaha ki yah sijief ke adhikaar kshetra main nahin aata 
 When asked why this banned substance is being found in the body of athletes, when similar cases were reported in front of Indian players, then it means that this substance is present in their food

 i cannot say with certainty

 The supplement industry is quite unregulated throughout the world
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘yah chintaa kaa kaaran he

 Delhi BJP vice-president and chairman of North Delhi Municipal Corporation Standing Committee, Jai Prakash has accused Kejriwal of a big charge
 unhone kaha ki kejariwal sarkaar ne dilli nagar nigam ke health fund main ek bhi paisa nahin diya he, isaki vajah se nagar nigam kaa khajaana khaali ho gaya he or ab agar dilli nagar nigam ke aspataal main dengue, chikangunia or malaria se kisi kii bhi maut hoti he to uske liye sidhe taur par kejariwal jimmedaar honge
 Not only this, the BJP has also accused Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of deliberately paralyzing the Municipal Corporation of Delhi
 jai prakaash ne kaha he ki chunaav kareeb he, aise main dilli sarkaar puri koshish karegi ki nagar nigam ko zyada se zyada mushkilon main daalaa jaae lekin ham aisa nahin hone denge
 Let me tell you that in the past, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had held a high level meeting in Delhi Secretariat on Dengue Chikungunya and Malaria before the monsoon
 us baithak main dilli sarkaar ke teen mantri or teenon hi nagar nigamon ke kamishnaron ko bulaayaa gaya tha
 But soon after, North Delhi Municipal Corporation Commissioner Varsha Joshi had accused the Delhi government of not releasing the health fund by tweeting
 varsha ne kaha tha ki ab uttari dilli nagar nigam ke paas aspataalon main davaaiyaan kharidne kaa bhi paisa nahin bachaa he
 Delhi government has always been asking for more funds from previous governments to corporations in this whole matter
 dilli sarkaar ke mutabik, unhone shila dikshit sarkaar ke mukaable apane shashan main dilli nagar nigam ko kahin zyada fund diya he
 However, the Delhi Municipal Corporation has completely rejected Kejriwal's claim

 During the election season, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also gave a big political message in a non-political interview given to Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar
 pradhanmantri modi ne is dilachasp intervyuu main apane raajnneetik virodhiyon kaa zikr aise vaakyon ko bataane main kiya, jiske bade nihitarth nikaale ja rahe hai
 In the interview, while PM Modi described Gulmanabi Azad as his friend, he said about his arch-rival West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee that she sends him kurtas and sweets every year
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ab tak jab bhi vipaksh ke netaaon kaa zikr kiya he, to unki naakaamiyon or khaamiyon kaa hi ‘bakhaan’ kiya
 Even when the heat of the election is at its peak, PM Modi's praise of his opponents is not embracing even the big political pundits
 beshak piem kii vipaksh ke kai netaaon se dosti hogi, lekin haal-philhal ke dinon main unhone sabhi ko nishane par hi rakhaa he
 In this 'non-political' interview, PM Modi told stories of friendship with his opposition leaders
 piem ne kaha ki bahut pehle kii baat he
 i was not even a CM then
 tab main kisi kaam se sansad gaya tha
 There Ghulam Nabi Azad and i were gossiping in a very friendly manner
 hamen is tarah baaten karte dekh media waalon ne kaha ki tum RSS vaale ho or aaazaad se dosti kaise ho gai
 Ghulam Nabi Azad responded well to this
 unhone kaha ki dekho bhai baahar aap log jo sochate ho vaisaa nahin he
 Perhaps as people of all the parties we are connected as a family, you cannot think
 piem modi ne apni dhur virdohi mamata banerjee kaa jis andaaj main zikr kiya, siyaasi jaankaar iske bade nihitarth nikaal rahe hai
 PM Modi very cleverly told Mamata Banerjee on her political connections that Didi still sends one or two kurtas in a year
 bangladesh kii pradhanmantri shaikh hasina kii tarah didi mithai bhi jarur bhejti hai
 During this time, PM Modi does not forget to inquire that it may harm him in the election
 yahaan modi jis nuksaan kii baat kar rahe hai, darasal wo nuksaan kam or napha zyada he
 In West Bengal, elections have been held for 10 seats in three phases in a total of 42 seats
 bache hue chaar charnon main rajya kii 32 siton par chunaav hone hai
 PM Modi knows very well that this statement will send a big message in Bengal
 mamata banerjee ke ab tak ke chunavi prachaar main 'hit list' main modi hi rahe hai
 Sitting in Bengal, targeting Didi in Delhi, Didi has repeatedly slammed PM Modi
 saaf jaahir he ki mamata kaa prachaar modi virodh ke hi ird-gird rahaa he
 Mamta Banerjee is trying to make air in her favor only by opposing Modi in entire Bengal
 aise main modi kaa ye kahana ki didi unhen har saal kurte or mithai bhejwati hai, mamata banerjee ke modi virodh kaa daawa kamjor karata he
 There is another aspect of Modi's statement
 maujuuda vakt main bijepi kii haalat 2014 jaisi nahin he
 a similar estimate is being made in all the surveys
 jiesti, notebandi, or rafel jaise muddon par puraa vipaksh unhen gherne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 In UP, the bsp-sp's mismatched friendship is also seen growing up in the Modi wave
 yani is baar upi main 73+ or desh main 300+ kaa bijepi kaa daawa kamjor dikh rahaa he
 In such a situation, if there are few numbers in the formation of the government after May 23, then the BJP has some scope for manipulation
 didi ke liye modi ke naram bol ko is gunjaaish se bhi jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 It is to be noted here that elections are to be held in 32 seats in West Bengal
 rajya main chauthe charan yani 29 april ko kul 8 siton beharampur, krishnanagar, ranaghat, bardhaman purv, bardhaman-durgapur, asanasol, bolpur, birbhum par chunaav hone hai
 In the fifth phase, elections will be held in seven seats Bangaon, Barrackpore, Howrah, Uluberia, Shrirampur, Hooghly, Arambagh, 8 seats in the sixth phase Tamluk, Kanti, Ghatal, Jhargram, Medinipur, Purnia, Bankura and Vishnupur
 saatven or aakhri charan main kul 9 siton damdam, barasaat, bashirhaat, jayanagar, mathurapur, diamond harbar, jadhavpur, kolkata dakshin, kolkata uttar main chunaav hone hai
 That is, the original picture of Bengal is still pending
 or isaki shuruyaat main hi modi ne mamata banerjee par ek gaiyr raajnneetik intervyuu main kurte or mithai kii baat bolkar behad chaalaaki bharaa daanv chalaa he

 Yuvraj, who is getting treatment for his illness abroad, will be surprised by Salman's greatness at this time

 According to the news, Yuvraj was endorsing a multivitamin tablet making company

 For Yuvraj too, Salman is no less than an elder brother, he has given proof in front of Salman's enemy Shahrukh

 In Jammu and Kashmir, the Janata Dal United (JDU), which has openly lodged a protest in Parliament on the issue of the removal of the provisions of Section 370, has now softened
 bijepi ke is sahyogi dal ne ab kaha he ki jab sansad main virodh ke baavjood dhara 370 ke ahm praavdhaan hat gaye to ab ise sweekaar kiya janaa chahie
 At the same time, while defending his decision to oppose the government on the issue of Section 370 in the House, jdu's Organization General Secretary RCP Singh said that the soul of the late George Fernandes was not hurt, so JDU opposed the removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir in Parliament
 did
 kyon baikfoot par ai jadayusutra bataa rahe hai ki dhara 370 par sarkaar ke faisle ko jis tarah se desh main janata kaa vyapak samarthan mila
 Even many leaders of the main opposition party, Congress, supported it by going beyond the party line
 usase janata dal united ko laga ki agar ab bhi vah virodh kaa stand leti he to phir yah janamat ke khilaaf jane vaali baat hogi
 Which may have to be lost later
 vahiin gathbandhan main bhi daraar pad sakati he
 Sources say that JDU was compelled to take a rebel stand on Article 370
 darasal, bihar main nitish kumaar kii secular chhavi ke kaaran bijepi se nazdikiyon ke baavjood jadyu ko muslimon kaa bhi kuch vot miltaa he
 Since Kashmir is a Muslim Dominated Area
 aise main jadyu ko laga ki sthaneey muslimon kii bhaawanaaon bhi kashmiri muslimon ke saath judin ho sakati hai
 Therefore, it should not be seen supporting it
 kuch aisa hi rukh teen talaak par bhi jadyu ne apanaaya tha
 According to sources, due to this, JDU has opposite attitude with BJP on the issue of Kashmir
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa ki pehle virodh or baad main rukh naram karne ke peeche jadyu ne donon dhadon ko saadhane kii ranneeti apanaai
 It is being said that this gave the JDU a message to its minority voters that it is against Article 370, on the other hand, later softened the stance and expressed that it does not even want to oppose the mood of the country
 jadyu ke rashtriya mahasachiv aaaraseepi singh ne ab sarkaar se jammu-kashmir main maujuud sabhi samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke saath rojgaar, vikaas aadi kii disha main behatari se kaam karne kii maang kii he

 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main congress or sharad yadav kii jediu ek saath siyaasi ranbhumi main utarane kii taiyaari he, lekin donon dalon ke bich gathjod kaa formula abhi tay nahin hua he
 Khevanhar MLA from JDU in Gujarat is Chhotubhai Vasava
 vasava rajya kii ek darjan siten maang rahe hai, lekin congress do-teen seat se zyada dene ke mood main nahin he
 Due to this, the path of alliance between Congress and JDU is not fixed
 aise main vasava congress se alag bhi apni raah talas rahe hai
 Let us tell that JDU MLA Chhotubhai Vasava did the job of crossing Congress veteran Ahmed Patel's Dagmagati Naiya in Gujarat Rajya Sabha elections
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main congress ne apana focus hardik patel or jignesh mewaani par laga rakhaa he, isse vasava asahaj ho gaye hai
 Chhotubhai Vasava is considered a veteran leader of the tribal community of Gujarat
 rajya main kareeb12 fisadi adivasimatadaata or rajya kii 27 vidhansabha siten adivaasiyon ke liye arakshit he
 Congress had won 16 of these 27 seats in the last assembly election
 iske alaava ek seat jediu or 10 seat par bijepi ne jeet darj kii thi
 Vasava is demanding about a dozen seats of tribal majority in South Gujarat, but these seats are dominated by the Congress
 aise main congress unhen do se teen seat dene ko taiyaar he
 Vasava is not agreeing on this plan of Congress
 iske alaava congress dediapaara vidhansabha seat par apana daawa pesh kar rahi he jahaan se chotubhai ke bete mahesh vasava chunaav ladanaa chaahate hai
 It is in this context that the formula for alliance between the two hangs in the balance
 bataa den ki jila parishad ke chunaav main jediu ne dediapaara vidhansabha kshetra main sabase zyada siten jitkar apana dabadabaa dikhaaya he
 The JDU claims that around 20 seats in tribal areas have Vasava influence in many areas
 aise main wo ek darjan siten maang rahe hai
 JDU believes that Hardik and Jignesh are yet to show any political influence, while JDU has made an impact by winning one seat in the panchayat elections and assembly

 There is a lot of resentment among the local people due to the functioning of the Sutlej Jal Vidyut Nigam, the agency producing the project
 alam yah he ki pinder ghati ke log sadakon par utar aae hai
 The Bhuswami Sangharsh Samiti, formed against this project, says that the corporation is neither concerned about the questions of the local people nor about the aspects related to the environment
 yah pariyojna paryaavarniya drushti se samvedansheel or bukampiy jone 4-5 main sthit he
 The environment ministry has also questioned the potential impact of the project

 He is not in a position to say what the depth and height of the dam will be and how it will affect the environment
 pinder ganga kii iklauti aisi sahaayak nadi bachi he, jis par ab tak koi pariyojna nahin he
 The people of Pinder Valley who have seen the impact of the dams in Mandakini valley have now become vocal against this dam
 unki maang he ki rajya kii is iklauti baandh rahit nadi ko aviral bahane diya jaae

 On October 13, 2009, the first public hearing for the project held in Kulsari was adjourned following strong opposition
 22 july 2010 ko block mukhyalay deval main yojit duusari jan sunwaayee kaa bhi yahi hashr hua
 The third hearing of the State Environmental Protection and Pollution Board held in Dewal Block on 20 January 2011 also dominated the police force and barricades were prevented from leaving the locals

 The people of Sarkot, Soding, Devsari, Poorna, Dewalgad, Tharali, Pathani, Silodi, Panagadh, Chapad, Kail, Talar, Garhkot, Charanga and Lausari villages directly affected by the project are concerned about their future

 36 hectare bhoomi adhigrahit hogi or iskaa jal sangrah kshetra 1,138 varg kilometre tak failaa hoga
 More than 500 families will be affected due to this project

 baandh banane ke baad tehri jile ke lagbhag 130 gaanvon main bhuskhalan or chattan khisakane kii samasya or bad gai he
 More than 30 people have died in the last three years due to cloudburst in the areas adjoining the Tehri dam
 ab isi tarah kaa dar pinder kshetra ke logon ko bhi gher rahaa he
 In 2010 too, many villages in the region were affected by landslides

 In such a situation, due to the heavy pressure of water, the landslide will also intensify as the geological movement in this area increases
 2004 main rajya ke seemaant janapad pithauragarh ke dharchula main bani dhauliganga jal vidyut pariyojna kii mukhya tunnel main hue risaav ke kaaran syankuri gaanv ke 18 pariwaron ke ghar jameendoj ho gaye or khet-khalihaan puri tarah se tabah ho gaye
 Not only this, there were cracks in dozens of houses
 udhar, teen paryaavarniya sunwaayiyon main se antim sunwaayee ko safal bataate hue kendriya paryaavaran mantralay ko report bhi bhej di gai
 On the basis of the report, the Environment Evaluation Committee of the Ministry has given the green signal to the project, while the Matu Jana Sangathan and the Bhuswami Sangharsh Samiti, who are opposing it, say that the public hearing which took place on January 20, 2011 is considered to be the last and successful , a large number of police were deployed therein
 yahaan tak ki apana paksh rakhane gaye graminon ko bolne bhi nahin diya gaya
 This is also proved by the corporation's report sent to the ministry, in which it is clearly written that 13 people have expressed their opinion in favor of public hearing
 sawaal yah he ki jis pariyojna kii jan sunwaayee teen saal main bhi puri nahin ho pai, jisamen darjanon gaanvon ke 500 parivaar prabhavit ho rahe hai, use sirf 13 logon ke paksh ke baad hi antim kaise maan liya gaya? vidambnaa yah ki virodh kii aawaaj na to centre or na hi rajya sarkaar tak pahunch paa rahi he
 The state government made land available for the project in November, ahead of the elections in the wake of political malaise, but the villagers are silent on questions
 is pariyojna se janajivan ke saath pracheen aasthaa ke centre bhi sankat main pad gaye hai
 Karnprayag is the only place located in this area, which until now was untouched by the impact of dams
 lekin ab vah bhi sankat main he
 The construction of this dam will create a livelihood crisis in front of 200 families living along the banks of river Pinder from Dewal to Paithani, who depend on the river for fish and other natural resources
 nandkesari se paithani tak ke saghan van samaapt ho jaaenge

 There are 24 hydropower projects under construction and proposed in an area of 70 km from the energy of the river to Karnprayag, for which a tunnel of about thirty kilometers will be built
 iske chalate aaj nahin to kal is jagah ke logon ko visthapit hona padegaa
 Suresh Bhai, director and environmentalist of Himalayan Institute of Environmental Education, Uttarkashi, says that this tunnel being built in Pinder Valley is very dangerous
 yah jin gaanvon ke nikat se gujaregi, vahaan bhuskhalan kaa khatra bana rahegaa
 Vimal Bhai of Matu Jan Sangathan, the leader of the movement in Pindar Valley, says that Pindar Ganga is flowing uninterrupted so far in the five Prayagas of the national river Ganga
 kam se kam ganga kii ek sahaayak nadi ko to akshunn chhod diya jaae
 The convener of the Bhuswami Sangharsh Samiti, Madan Mishra, says that it is the effect of the movement that while earlier officials were saying that only 20 villages were affected, now they have accepted this number as 36
 chunaavon ke dauraan yah mudda haaavee rahaa
 CPI (M) people who have come out against it say that if the Devsari project is built, after Old Tehri, another culturally diverse area will be submerged

 The figure of sexual violence against girls in Delhi is very frightening
 badi baat ye he ki isamen shaadishuda mahilaon ko shaamil nahin kiya he or aankadon ke anusaar rajdhani dilli kii har teesri ladki kisi na kisi kism kii yon hinsa kaa shikaar hoti he
 Some people understand the language of statistics and now it has become clear from statistics that Delhi is not safe for women
 dilli ke antarrashtriya gaiyrsarkari sanghathan population council kii haalia report main kishor yani 10 se lekar 14 saal tak kii ladakiyon ke khilaaf yon hinsa ke chaunkaane vaale aankade saamne aae hai
 According to this survey conducted in the urban poor ie slum areas, 32 percent girls in Delhi have experienced some or the other incident of sexual violence in the last one year
 population council kii shodhakarta sharmishtha basu kahati hai ki hamane mukhya taur par aarthik or saamaajik rup se pichde ilaake ko chunaa, kyonki yahaan ek taraf yon hinsa bhi hoti he or duusari taraf uski shikaayat bhi peedita mukhar hokar nahin kar paati
 Sharmistha said, we have seen that in many cases girls are not able to share these things even with their peer group i
e
 friends, while they are the closest
 phir parivaar or police tak jane kii to baat hi chhod dijie
 By the way, the matter is limited to girls only
 12 fisadi ladke bhi sharmnaak aankadon vaali is fehrist main hai
 In most cases these sexual violence has been committed by teenagers older than boys
 kahaan to ham dilli ko sirf ladakiyon ke liye khatarnaak hone kii baat karte hai or aankade bataa rahe hai ki yahaan ladke bhi surakshit nahin hai
 Now it is another matter that parents do not know the truth of these cases nor are there reports in police
 sharmishtha se aaj tak ne poocha ki jin 12 fisadi ladakon ne yon hinsa kii baat kabuuli he, kya usamen unase badi umr kii ladkiyaan shaamil rahi hai
 Sharmishtha said that no clear questions were asked about it, but in most cases only older boys were involved in it
 vaise ye research report philhal puri nahin hui he or puri dilli main alag-alag ilaake iskaa hissaa honge
 An important statistic of current research is that parents are not even aware of most of these cases of sexual violence with children, because one parent is not able to become a confidant of children and the other is called taboo
 That is, they hide what they do not know
 jaahir he, yon hinsa se bacchon ko bachaane kii jimmedaari sirf kanoon ke bharose nahin chodi ja sakati, balki maa-baap ko bhi lagaataar bacchon ke sampark main rahakar unka vishwast bananaa hoga

 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle apana janaadhar badhaane ko betaab argedy pramukh bithaane lage gotiyaan
 It was a meeting of top RJD leaders
 charchaa chunavi ranneeti par chal rahi thi ki tabhi do rajyasabha saansadon ram kripal yadav or premchand gupta ke bich gathbandhan ke mudde par bahes hone lagi
 Premchand Gupta wanted Lalu Yadav to get rid of the fruitless alliance with Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) this time
 lekin ram kripal kaa kahana tha ki algepi se ek pratishat vot kaa bhi phayda hota ho to is gathjod ko banaae rakhaa jaae
 Lalu Prasad Yadav also got worried because he is desperate to increase his base before the general elections
 2009 main lalu ne jo tab upie-1 main rail mantri the, congress kii keemat par algepi pramukh ke saath gathjod kiya tha or isaki baari keemat chukaai
 This time they have decided that they will distribute seats on the basis of ground reality and not on the basis of old assumptions
 hafte bhar baad lalu ne paswan ke ek kareebi se kaha, 'apane netaa ko kaho ki ve daura karte samay sambhavit ummidavaaron ko maala na pahanaaen
 The voter is confused
 'lalu puri koshish kar rahe hai ki congress ke saath chunaav se pehle gathbandhan ho jaae
 An RJD MP said, 'lalu has met Rahul Gandhi at least thrice since November 2012
 'congress ne 2009 kaa loksabhaa chunaav akele ladaa tha jabaki lalu or paswan donon hi upie-1 main mantri the or congress ko bihar kii 40 loksabhaa siton main sirf teen siten hi de rahe the
 Congress fought alone and 10
 26 pratishat vot hasil kiye
 Because of this, the RJD-LJP alliance had to face many seats
 endie virdohi voton ke bant jane se lalu kii jheli main sirf 4 siten ain jabaki 2004 main uske paas 24 saansad (bihar main 22 or jharkhand main 2) the
 LJP did not get a single seat
 duusari ore, endie ko 32 siten milin or congress ko do
 The RJD chief has now started correcting his mistakes a year before the Lok Sabha elections
 jansabhaon main badhati bheed ne unke hausale badha die hai, lekin ve bakhubi jaanate hai ki abhi unhen bahut mehnat kerani hogi
 There have been four by-elections in Bihar since the RJD was eliminated in the 2010 assembly elections
 sattadhari gathbandhan ne chaaron hi siten jeet leen, lekin argedy yaa lalu samarthit ummidavaaron ne sabhi siton par apane vot badaye hai
 The good news for Lalu is that his hold on the Yadav caste with more than 14 percent population still remains
 vaise unke liye chintaa kii bhi vajahen hai
 The difference in the number of votes between the jdu-led NDA and his party has also increased
 lalu kaa vot aadhaar nitish kumaar kii janaadhar vaali ibisi (ati pichhadi jatiyaan), mahadalit, agadi jatiyon or pasmanda muslimon ke gathjod ke aage kamjor ho gaya he
 Nitish has been able to break into Lalu's base by giving tickets to a large number of Yadav and Muslim candidates from his alliance
 aaj jediu ke paas argedy ke mukaable zyada sankhya main yadav or muslim vidhayak hai
 The results of the 2009 general election and the 2010 Bihar assembly election have revealed three things: The muslim-yadav (mai), who is considered to be unbeatable to Lalu, has collapsed
 nitish ko ati pichhadi jatiyon or mahadaliton kaa khaasaa samarthan miltaa he
 a section of forward castes and in some places Muslims have become supporters of the Congress
 lalu ke liye sankat kii baat yah he ki nitish ke khilaaf satta-virdohi bhaawanaaon ke baavjood bihar kii raajnneeti main saamaajik samikarnon main badlaav nahin aayaa he
 a deeper look at the political scenario of Bihar shows that people are not attending Lalu's public meetings because their popularity has increased
 ve isliye jute rahe hai ki nitish sarkaar kii kai nitiyon se log naaraaz hai
 But whether this outrage will translate into votes for Lalu is a big question
 pichley saal april main jab sonia gandhi nai dilli main lalu ke tughlaq maarg sthit nivas par unki beti kii shaadi ke resepshan main pahunchi thim, to lalu ne hanskar unase kaha ki unki beti bhi congress parivaar main ja rahi he
 His gesture was that his daughter is getting married to Haryana Youth Congress President Chiranjeev Rao who is the son of Haryana Minister Ajay Singh Yadav
 sonia is par muskaraa uthi thim or unhone kaha tha ki congress bhi lalu ko pasand karti he
 Now, a year before the Lok Sabha elections, Lalu is hopeful that Sonia will translate what she said into reality

 Bikram Chaudhary, a yoga guru famous for teaching hot yoga caught in a sex scandal, is once again in the news
 unka unki patni rajshri se talaak ho gaya he
 Rajshree has received Ferrari, Mercedes 550 and Bentley cars from the Bikram in the settlement along with the houses in Brewery Hills and Los Angeles
 un par haal hi ek america court main vakil minakshi ke yon shoshan karne ke jurm main kareeb chah karod rupee jurmaana lagaaya tha
 Kolkata-born Bikram Chaudhary, when he left India about 40 years ago and made his move to America, he did not even think that once he would start ruling the world due to his yoga practice
 apni koshish or kismat kii badaulat usne jo kuch hasil kiya, uski duusari misaal koi ho hi nahin sakati
 But her wrong habits and the accusations of rape by several girls brought her into controversy
 videshiyon ke liye yoga ek nai cheez thi
 Bikram discovered the unique recipe to keep people well and educated at a temperature of 40 degrees Celsius, and on seeing this, he brought Chaudhary to fame
 duniya bhar ke celibrities dekhte hi dekhte uske diwane ho gaye
 The years of Hindustan had now turned into 'hot yoga'
 hasil kii yoga ke 26 asana kii patentchoudhary ne maukey kaa phayda uthaaya or hot yoga ke 26 asana kii patent hasil kar lee
 Gradually, he achieved everything that a common man could aspire to
 phir chaahe wo aaleeshaan bangala ho, mahangi gaadi yaa phir karodon kii daulat
 He had everything, but the Sheesh Mahal cracked when a student accused the rape of creating a sensation in the world
 46 saal choti ladki ne lagaaya aaropiske baad bikram choudhary par yon utpeedan ke iljaamon kii jhadi si lag gai
 The five girls accused him of rape and molestation
 iske do saal baad phir thik ek vaisaa hi iljaam laga
 This time a student 46 years younger than him alleged that he was raped in 2010
 maalish ke bahaane jyaadati kii gai
 In this case, the girl also filed a case in the US court
 chaar saal kii umr se shuru kiya yogachaar saal kii umr se yoga kii shuruyaat karne vaale bikram kaa janm kolkata main hua tha
 On seeing this, he started feeling like yoga that he started practicing yoga for at least 6 hours every day
 is kadi mehnat kaa nateeja ye hua ki vah tamaam yogasano main behad maahir ho gaye
 At the age of just 13, he won the title of National India Yoga Championship

 After this he remained in America
 unhone vahaan yoga sikhaane kii shuruyaat kar di
 He then started bikramhot Yogaki under his own name and became a brand
 kai mulkon main yoga studios kii shuruyaat kar di
 Still, Bikram is crazy about Chaudhary, facing the accusations of sexual harassment all over the world, but of course there is no shortage of celebrities among his dead
 jis shaks ko america aane kii pehali daavat koi or nahin, balki khud america raashtrapati detaa ho, us shaks kii haisiyat kaa andaja lagaana mushkil nahin he

 The singer was returning home after mesmerizing hundreds of listeners with her melodious singing at an event in Haryana, but suddenly a car stopped her car on the way
 car main singer ke saath baithe uske teen saathiyon ko baahar nikaala or phir behad kareeb se singer kii canapati par ek ke baad k chaar goli maari
 We are telling you the story of the death of singer Harshita
 haryana kii jaani-pahachaani lok gayikaharshitaane apni adaaon ke jalwe bikhere the
 Hundreds of people had lost their hearts by hanging
 lekin panipat main hue ek shandaar kaarykram ke baad qaatilon kii goliyon ne achaanak hi use chalni kar diya
 After a program on Tuesday, she had left for Panipat to Delhi with three companions in her car that a car from behind behind a village on the panipat-rohtak road was stopped by overtaking the car of folk singer Harshita Dahiya and After taking down the remaining three people from the car, he shot four bullets one by one at the edge of Harshita
 qaatil ek nile rang kii ford figo car main aae the or unki taadaad bhi chaar thi
 One incident of such a terrible and fearless murder was enough to frighten the whole of Haryana in itself
 upar ye qatl kisi gumnaam shaks kaa nahin, balki dilli or haryana ke lakhon javaan dilon kii dhadkan singer gita urf harshitha daahiya kaa tha, jisane haryana ke saath-saath paas kii dilli main bhi sansani failaa di
 By the way, Harshita had a connection with Haryana, as much as Delhi
 wo mul rup se beshak haryana kii thi, lekin rahati dilli ke narela ilaake main thi
 In order to understand the issue of Harshitha's murder, it is necessary to watch and understand some videos that have been put on her side on social media
 jinamein wo kisi gumnaam shaks ko chunauti detii dikhaai detii he
 But the question is, who killed Harshita and why? Why did she post such videos on social sites, one after another? After all, Harshita was constantly challenging her enemy for a long time? And was Harshita murdered by the same enemy whom she used to dare? Or is there someone else's hand behind this problem and why? So to know the answers to these questions, it is as important to look into these videos of Harshita and understand, it is equally important to look into her life
 philhal panipat police yahi kar rahi he
 But the horror of the murder of a girl killed in a very mysterious way in the middle road, its secrets are probably as deep

 is par kaaphi raajnneeti or vaad-vivaad ho rahaa he
 It is being said that Assam is the first state to take initiative in the matter of NRC and now there is a demand to bring NRC in other states as well
 lekin aapako yah jaanakar achraj hoga ki desh ke sabhi rajyon main pehle hi enarasi taiyaar ho chukaa he
 Let's know what is the truth
 
 
 asal main desh ke bantwaare ke baad yah jaananaa jaruri tha ki desh main kitne log vaid yaa avaidh tareeke se rahe hai
 Therefore, in the year 1951 after independence, a National Register of Citizens was prepared across the country
 yah sabhi rajyon main taiyaar kiya gaya
 In this way, the NRC that is being prepared in Assam is not new, but only the NRC of 1951 is being updated
 saal 1951 main desh bhar main janaganana hui thi, jisamen har gaanv main sabhi makaanon kii kramvaar order ke mutabik jaankaree or usamen kitne log rahete hai, yah jaankaree hasil hui thi
 After this, the National Register of Citizens was prepared with the help of this census
 is register ko taiyaar karne ke baad ise centre sarkaar ke nirdesh par sabhi ilaakon ke dipti kamishnar or esadm ke daftaron main rakhaa gaya
 Later in the 1960s these registers were handed over to the Police Department
 kya he assam kaa enarasiasam kaa enarasi asal main saal 1951 main bane enarasi ko apadet karne kii hi kavayad he
 This includes all those whose names are included in the electoral rolls before 1971 or the NRC of 1951
 assam main kaise aage badha enarasi apadet karne kaa kafasal main sabhi rajyon main 1951 main jo enarasi taiyaar kii gai thi, vah janaganana par aadhaarit thi, isamen logon kaa samuchit veriphication nahin kiya gaya tha
 In this way, the upgrading of NRC in Assam has also been done for the first time in any state with such verification of citizenship
 1980 ke dashak main assam main avaidh logon ko baahar karne kaa ek bada andolan hua
 The All Assam Students Union gave a memorandum to the Prime Minister, seeking to update the NRC of 1951
 lekin iske baad 1985 main hue assam samjhaute main enarasi ke apadet karne kii baat shaamil nahin kii gai
 In 1990, Asu demanded that the Assam Accord be implemented
 iske baad 17 november, 1999 ko hue tripaksheeya samjhaute main enarasi ko apadet karne kaa nirnay liya
 During the Manmohan Singh era, the government of Manjuritiya approved an amount of Rs 20 crore for the initial work
 lekin kai vajahon se yah kaam shuru nahin ho paaya
 Subsequently, it was approved to update the NRC in the tripartite agreement signed on 5 May 2005 under Manmohan Singh's tenure
 lekin kaam kuch khaas aage nahin badha
 Then after a tripartite meeting on 22 April 2010, the pilot project started in Chaygaon and Barpeta Circle in the state
 upie sarkaar ne di pratik hajela ko jimmedaariakhirkaar maujuuda prakriyaupie sarkaarake samay hi saal 2013 main shuru hui, jab pratik hajela ko enarasi apadet karke liye state koordinator banaaya gaya
 But the actual work gained momentum in February 2015 when the process of setting up NRC service centers started and 6
 6 karod dastavejon ke saath enarasi main naam daalane ke liye 3
 29 crore people applied
 supreme court kaa nirdevgast 2014 main supreme court ne assam sarkaar ko enarasi apadation kii puri prakriya ko teen saal ke bheetar puraa karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 The central government sanctioned Rs 288 crore to update this register

 haryana main trishanku miltaa dikh rahaa janadeshcangress kii doguni ho sakati hai vidhansabhasitaharyana vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey aa gaye he
 No political party has got a clear majority in the results
 haalanki bijepi 40 siton ke saath sabase badi party ke taur par ubhari he
 At the same time, Congress is in second position with 31 seats while JJP has won 10 seats
 bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav kii haar se niraash congress ke liye bhupendra singh hooda haryana main ek baar phir sanjivani banate najar aa rahe hai
 The Congress high command has decided to make Bhupendra Singh Hooda the face in Haryana and Kumari Selja as state president just 15 days before the assembly election announcement
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki sonia gandhi party or putr rahul gandhi ke moh main fansi rahi, jiske chalate bhupendra singh hooda par bharosa jataane main kaaphi der kar di
 Explain that in the 2014 assembly elections, BJP got 47 seats, Congress 15, INLD 19 and others 9 seats
 dilachasp baat ye he ki 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad se bhupendra singh hooda haryana tatkaaleen pradesh adhyaksh rahe ashok tanvar ko hataane kii maang karte rahe, lekin rahul gandhi ke kareebi hone ke chalate congress sheersh netritv ise najar andaaj karata rahaa
 Here are the results of Haryana's election that Hooda rallied in Rohtak and gave an ultimatum to the Congress high command to remove Tanwar
 iske baad kahin jaakar pradesh adhyaksh pad se ashok tanvar ko hataakar kumari shailajako party kii kaman saunpi gai or bhupendra singh hooda ko sielpi leader or haryana main congress kaa cheharaa banaaya gaya
 On 4 September, Congress President Sonia Gandhi decided to enter the electoral arena with the face of Bhupendra Hooda's face in Haryana
 haryana main hooda ko congress pratyaashiyon ke chayan se lekar chunaav main har faisle ke liye puri chhot di gai
 Hooda contested the entire election on local issues and pitched himself as an alternative to Khattar
 isi ke chalate jat samudaay kaa bada tabaka hooda ke naam par congress ke saath ekajute hota dikhaai diya
 In such a situation, the question arises that if the Congress high command had handed over the command to Bhupendra Singh Hooda and earlier, the results of Haryana would have been different? desh kii sabase puraani raajnneetik party congress pichley 40 din se jo ummid lagaae baithi thi, wo ummid hi tut gai
 Rahul Gandhi did not agree and finally on Wednesday he resigned as the President of the party
 saath hi saath unhone ye bhi kah diya ki party ko apana nayaa adhyaksh jald se jald chun lenaa chahie
 The way he has announced this by writing a four-page letter, it has created a crisis in front of the Congress and people are saying 'ek Thi Congress'
 23 may 2019 ko jab dilli ke bijepi mukhyalay se jashn kii tasviren aa rahi thim to vahaan se keval dedh kilometre dur 12 tughlaq len main bhartiya rashtriya congress (INC) kaa sabase bada netaa nirvikaar bhav se apane nepathy kii bhoomika likh rahaa tha
 On 23 May, on the day of the results, Rahul Gandhi was disappointed, so disappointed that he conceded defeat in Amethi even before the results were revealed
 wo bhi tab, jab amethi main teen lakh voton kii ginati baaki thi
 But it seemed as if he had lost interest in the outcome
 kyonki amethi keval ek seat nahin thi, rahul gandhi ke sammaan kii bhi ladaai thi
 This seat was represented by both his mother Sonia and father Rajiv, who were themselves mps for fifteen years
 amethi kii sharmnaak haar ne rahul gandhi ke bheetar netritv kii ichha ko bhi haraa diya tha
 External criticism, mockery on facebook-twitter and other channels and the party's internal rhetoric had pushed Rahul Gandhi to the point where he considered himself a failure
 nateezon ke chalis din baad unhone jo chitthee likhi he wo is baat kaa kaboolnamaa he
 With this letter, the Congress leaders were shocked, more than it was felt by the leaders of the opposition parties, Twitter trollers and self-styled political analysts of Facebook who have been calling their resignation a drama for the last 40 days
 apane faisle par adig rahul ne unase agle majaak kii bhoomika chin lee thi
 Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot came to celebrate
 madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri kamalnath manaane pahunche the
 Mallikarjun Kharge also came to celebrate
 khud maa sonia gandhi or bahan priyanka gandhi gayi
 But Rahul did not budge
 hajaaron kaaryakartaaon ne bhi manaane kii koshish kii
 The leaders sat on a dharna, from the act of giving life to the queue of resignations
 ye awaajen rahul tak pahunchin to jarur lekin unhen diga nahin sakin
 Is Rahul Gandhi's resignation a natural decision? Did Rahul Gandhi's grip on the organization weaken? Rahul had said this very reluctantly
 naa to khud rahul ko, nahin congress ko or na hi desh ko ye ummid thi ki congress loksabhaa chunaavon main modi ko haraa degi
 But it seemed to everyone that she would do better than before
 lekin jab rahul smriti irani ke haathon amethi tak ganvaa baithe to unki saakh or saahas donon ne jawaab de diya
 So you can say that the first chapter of non-gandhi era has been written in Congress, but how did it come about
 rahul gandhi ko paristhitiyon ne parrast kar diya yaa tajurbe kii kami ne, ye sawaal baar-baar uth rahaa he
 One year, seven months and 17 days, this is the age of presidency of Rahul Gandhi
 unhone likhaa he ki kai baar party ke netaaon ne unhen akelaa chhod diya
 Now the challenge before the Congress party is to stand up, to choose a new president
 lekin is chunauti main bhi sabase badi chunauti ye he ki ye kaam unhen bina gandhi parivaar ke karnaa he
 Because while leaving the post, Rahul Gandhi has said that neither will he choose the president nor will he be involved in this process
 pakistan ko aatanki hamalon ke silsile main aatanki kasaab ke diene or finger print saunpe jaaenge

 He said that efforts are being made by the Education Department to impart quality education but for their better future, they will also have to provide better knowledge of the language

 Input language loksabhaa chunaav (lok Sabha Election 2019) se pehle priyanka gandhi (priyanka Gandhi Vadra) kii sakriy raajnneeti main dastak ne upi kesiyasi sameekaran ko ek baar phir se ulajhaa diya he
 The direct contest between BJP and SP-BSP alliance in UP has now made the contest triangular by Priyanka Gandhi's entry
 priyanka gandhi kii raajnneetik entry ke baad se ab har koi yahi sawaal kar rahaa he ki kya ek majboot daavedaari pesh karne kaa daawa karne vaali congress se bijepi ko phayda milegaa? kya congress ke is kadam se mayawati ko nuksaan hoga?agar kuch siyaasi samikarnon par najar daudaya jaae to aise halaat banate dikh rahe hai ki congress ke aane se shaayad bhaajapa ko sidhe taur par phayda ho saktaa he
 In fact, after Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav kept Congress out of the SP-BSP alliance in Uttar Pradesh, party president Rahul Gandhi announced that the Congress party would contest all 80 seats in the state
 kuch dinon baad hi unhone apni bahan priyanka gandhi ko congress mahasachiv or purvi upi kaa prabharee banaakar upi kii siyasat main ek nayaa twist laa diya
 At the same time, the Congress has given the message in western UP to Jyotiraditya Scindia that the Congress has not separated from the race yet
 aisa isliye bhi kyonki rahul gandhi ne spasht taur par kaha he ki unki party congress rajya main kisi bhi keemat par baikfoot par rahakar nahin khelegi
 However, even after giving charge of East UP and Western UP to Priyanka Gandhi and Jyotiraditya Scindia respectively, Rahul Gandhi expressed respect for Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav
 unhone spasht kar diya ki ve donon diggaj unke dushman nahin hai or agar sambhav hua to vah sapa-basapa gathbandhan main sahyog karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 That is, Rahul Gandhi has still opened his doors in the SP-BSP alliance in UP
 magar ab sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya congress ke is kadam se sapa-basapa ke votbank par asar padegaa? kya congress basapa-sapa ke votbank main sendhamari karegi, jisase bijepi ko phayda hoga
 If this happens, the BJP, which won 71 seats in 2014, will be able to register its strong presence once again
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke sutron ne jor dekar kaha ki congress mayawati ke vot bank main sendhari karne main sakshan nahin hogi
 It will not break Mayawati's votebank, which mostly consists of Dalits or other backward classes
 vahiin, is gathbandhan main muslim votbank kaa sangyojan bhi he jo akhilesh yadav kii samaajawaadee party kaa samarthan karte hai
 Samajwadi Party's Juhi Singh said that it is difficult for the Congress to do so
 ek congressi netaa ne kaha ki yah adhik sambhaavna he ki congress party bijepi ke ucch jati (savarna) ke vot bank main sendhamari karegi, kyonki yah varg pehle congress kaa samarthan karata tha, jo baad main bhaajapa kii ore sthanantarit ho gaya
 Sources said that the party will field strong candidates on important seats which will occupy the brahmin-thakur voter base
 haalanki, bhaajapa ke siddharth nath singh ne in sambhaavnaaon ko khaarij kar diya
 He said that 'I doubt the Congress will get the votes of the Brahmins
 darasal, ucch jatiyaan buddhijivi varg hai or unhone piem modi ko nirnaayak nirnay lete dekha he
 In addition, the upper castes got the 10 percent quota they wanted
 bataa den ki nayaa kota kanoon jo saamaanya varg main aarthik rup se kamjor virgon ko naukariyon or shiksha main aarakshan degaa
 At the same time, Samajwadi Party spokesperson Juhi Singh made it clear that the Congress would be held responsible for any negative result within the Grand Alliance
 unhone kaha, "yah congress kaa aantarik maamla he ki vah kaise chunaav ladanaa chaahati hai, lekin hamaare liye unki yahi salaah he ki yadi aap jimmedaari lete hai, to aapako javabdeh bhi hona hoga
 "in 2009, the Congress won 21 seats
 magar 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main yah ankada do par pahunch gaya or congress party sirf sonia gandhi kii raibareli or rahul gandhi kii amethi seat hi bachaa pai
 Not only this, the vote share of Congress is also the lowest level 7 so far
 5 fisadi par aa gaya
 At the same time, the Congress, which fought in alliance with Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party in the 2017 assembly elections, won just four out of 10 assembly seats in the Amethi and Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituencies
 us vakt bhi akhilesh yadav ne sanket diya tha ki congress ke saath gathbandhan ne unki sambhaavnaaon ko khatm kiya tha
 But this time, Mayawati, who announced an alliance with Akhilesh Yadav, cited the reason for keeping the Congress separate that the Congress party did not have the ability to transfer votes
 vahiin, rahul gandhi ne kaha ki congress ke paas uttar pradesh kii janata ko dene ke liye bahut kuch he

 master blaster sachin tendulkar (sachin Tendulkar)bhale hi ab field par khelte hae najar nahin aate lekin phir bhi unke phans aaj bhi unhen kaaphi miss karte hai
 From playing cricket in the street to the World Cup, Sachin Tendulkar has always been talking about his days of struggle
 haal hi main unhone apane twitor handle par ek twit karte hue apane phans se chennai ke taj coromandal hotel ke ek karmchaaree ke bare main poocha tha, jiske baad ab usne khud master blaster se milane ke liye kaha he
 Speaking to ANI, an employee working in a Chennai hotel said, "sachin's fans want to meet him and he wants to meet me
" isliye main kaaphi utsahit hum
 The people where i live and my friends are more excited than me to meet Sachin Tendulkar
 isliye main sachin tendulkar se anurodh karata hum ki vah mujhase or mere parivaar se milen or hamaare saath kuch vakt bitaayen''
 Referring to the incident involving Sachin Tendulkar, Guruprasad said, “at that time i used to work as a security guard in the Taj Hotel
 tab meri unase mulaakaat hui thi or maine unhen suzav diya tha ki unke alboguard kii vajah se vah match main out ho jate hai
 "guruprasad continued," When you look at Sachin closely, you will find that he uses his wrist in a way that is very important to him
 jab vah tej gendbaajon kaa saamana karte hai, to ve ek vishesh bindu par hamalaa karte hai or yadi albo guard sahi dhang se nahin laga hua, to samay or sab galat ho jaataa he
 He asked me how do you know this, then i said that i was just watching you on television and i felt that the elbow guard is affecting your hand movement ''
 bataa den isse pehle sachin tendulkar ne apane twitor par ek video share karte hue logon se chennai ke is shaks ko dhundne ke liye kaha tha
 In his tweet, Sachin wrote, "I stayed in Taj Coromandel, Chennai during a Test series
 tab vahaan kaa ek karmchaaree mila tha, jiske saath meri albo guard ke bare main charchaa hui thi, jiske baad maine ise phir se dizin kiya tha
 i want to know where he is now and meet him ''
 iske baad unhone twitor par apane phans se poocha, ''kya aap use dhundne menisamen meri madad kar sakate hai''?a chance encounter can be memorable! i had met a staffer at Taj Coromandel, Chennai during a Test series with whom i had a discussion about my elbow guard, after which i redesigned it
 i wonder where he is now & wish to catch up with him
 Hey netizens, can you help me find him? pic

 Every party knows that to reach power, the magic figure of 272 has to be touched and Uttar Pradesh will have the most important role in reaching that figure
 isi target ko hasil karne ke liye narendra modi, rahul gandhi or arvind kejariwal apane-apane vaadon kaa tarkash lekar upi kii samarbhumi main kud pade hai
 This old saying is quite popular in the grammar of politics that the road to power for Delhi passes through Lucknow
 lakhanu yani puraane nawabon kii nagari or nae jamaane main uttar pradesh kii rajdhani
 The same Uttar Pradesh, where 80 members come to the Lok Sabha
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi ke piem ummidavaar narendra modi, congress ke bhavishya rahul gandhi or AAP kii ummid arvind kejariwal, sabake raste upi kii taraf mud gaye hai
 Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Indira Gandhi, Charan Singh, Rajiv Gandhi, Vishwanath Pratap Singh, Chandrashekhar and Atal Bihari Vajpayee - 8 Prime Ministers of India have left from UP
 agar piem nahin bhi bane, to kisko pataa nahin ki jiske sir par upi kaa haath hota he, sarkaar usee kii banati he
 The last time the Congress got 22 seats, Manmohan Singh's second innings became easier
 isliye 80 kii agnipariksha main sabhi jute gaye hai
 From modi-kejriwal to Rahul

 ek march ko rahul gandhi baba vishwanath kii nagari main the, to ravivaar ko vijay shankhanaad raily ke liye narendra modi lakhanu main hai
 Arvind Kejriwal is holding a rally in Kanpur, while SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and UP CM Akhilesha Yadav are holding an election rally in Allahabad
 mulaayam ne modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha he ki modi raily kii bheed par dhyaan na den, balki vikaas par dhyaan den
 Kejriwal, who stopped bjp's power chariot in Delhi at a distance of just four mlas, will now challenge Narendra Modi standing 84 kilometers away and Modi will show BJP the dream of winning Delhi from Lucknow
 sansad kii ladaai solahavin loksabhaa ke liye ab sadak par aa gai he
 That is why the hooligans of power are swinging on the road
 kahin raily ke rup main, kahin road sho ke rup main, to kahin nukkad bahes ke rup main
 Every face is engaged in the last exercise to make itself the most beautiful
 puure josh main hai arvind kejarivaldilli vidhansabha main mili jeet ne AAP main itnaa hausala bhar diya ki arvind kejariwal kehane lage ki unka muqabla to sidhe narendra modi se he
 Now this match will be seen in UP on March 2, when Kejriwal from Kanpur will open the account of his claims and promises
 lekin usase pehle road sho ke jariye 17 loksabhaa siton ko chune kii koshish bhi kar lee
 It will take 6 hours to cover a distance of 464 km from Ghaziabad to Kanpur, but Kejriwal will take thirty hours to cover this distance
 lekin tees ghante main kejariwal uttar pradesh kii 17 loksabhaa siton ko naap lenaa chaahate hai
 For this measure, he has the scale of the work of his 49-day government in Delhi
 jab kejariwal dilli main vidhansabha kaa chunaav lard rahe the, tab bahut kam logon ko andaja tha ki AAP kaa jhaadu congress ke vajood or bijepi ke sapane ko ek jatke main saaf kar degaa
 Then Kejriwal was knocking from the streets of Delhi to every locality
 ab dilli kii 70 vidhansabha siton se aage badhkar loksabhaa kii 545 siton kii ladaai par kejariwal vahi daanv aajamaa rahe hai
 The journey from Ghaziabad to Kanpur is its beginning
 pashchimi uttar pradesh kisi jamaane main purv pradhanmantri choudhary charan singh ke ishaare par chalata tha
 His son Ajit Singh inherited the inheritance, but over time his influence and base deteriorated
 ab charan singh kii viraasat par kejariwal kii najar he
 The March 2 rally in Kanpur is the first litmus test of Kejriwal's strength
 lekin is raily se pehle kejariwal apane road sho ke jariye gajiabad, meerut, muradabad, amroha, rampur, bareli, shahjahanpur, hardoi, unnav, kanpur, kanpur dehaat, auraiya, itawa, firozabad, agra, mathura or gautamabuddha nagar par asar chhodane kii koshish kii
 But opponents say that UP is not Delhi
 kejariwal pehle hi elaan kar chuke hai ki unka muqabla narendra modi se he
 Now is it a coincidence or a well-thought-out strategy that from which Kanpur Modi started his election meetings in UP, Kejriwal is also starting from there
 upi jeetne ke pher main modiarvind kejariwal kanpur main honge, to narendra modi apane dal-bal ke saath lakhanu main
 Lucknow is not only important for the BJP because it is the capital of UP, but also because it is from here that its peak man Atal Bihari Vajpayee reached the Lok Sabha many times
 ab modi yaheen se upi jeetne kii ranneeti banaaenge
 Modi's mission is 272 plus
 isiilie to upi kii 80 siton par sabase zyada nazren tiki hai narendra modi kii bhi, bijepi kii bhi or sangh kii bhi, kyonki sabko pataa he ki upi jeeta, to desh jeetna bahut aasaan ho jayega
 Modi rallied in different parts of UP
 kanpur se varanasi tak or meerut se gorakhpur tak unka udankhatola camel ke khilne kii ummiido ko bhaanpata rahaa
 Somewhere the old ragas were sung, and somewhere the slogan of development was raised on the 56-inch chest
 ab sawaal he ki 56 inch ke seene kii dhadkan upi main kitni siton par bijepi kii jeet kii guarantee banegi
 But who will give up hope till the election
 lihaaja ab nishaanaa sidhe lakhanu par he, jahaan do morch ko modi kii raily hogi, sidhe upi ke dil main
 Lucknow's importance to the BJP is also enhanced by the fact that Atal Bihari Vajpayee used to contest elections from here as Prime Minister
 sawaal to aise bhi uchhalata he ki kya vaajapeyi ke juute main modi ke paanv padenge?uttar pradesh main bijepi ko pichhali baar 10 siten mili thim, jabaki congress ko 22 siten
 This time Modi wants to completely change the number of seats and Rahul wants to maintain the old status
 isliye wo road sho kar rahe hai or modi chaahe kahin bhi rahen, un par nishaanaa lagane se nahin chookte
 There are 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh
 chauthe number kii party ko pehle number par laana modi ke liye ek mushkil sabak he
 The fight with Congress is all over the country, in UP, Mulayam and Mayawati are already standing on the beat
 rahul kaise rahanaa chahenge peeche?kejariwal road sho kar rahe hai, narendra modi raily karenge, to rahul gandhi road-sabha kar rahe hai
 In Varanasi, Rahul Gandhi put a chaupal of common people near the station
 unka dukh-durd sunne ke bahaane chunavi mausam main congress ke liye phija banane kii koshish kii
 Such an attempt to keep a finger on every heart is often seen during election season
 ek nae bharat kii khoj main nikle rahul gandhi aazaadee ke 67 saal baad garibon kaa dard samaj rahe hai
 Narendra Modi is flying in the sky
 kejariwal sadak par daud rahe hai, to rahul gandhi logon ke bich baithkar unka dil tatol rahe hai
 Everyone's eyes are on UP
 rahul ko banaras se mirzapur janaa tha, lekin mausam bigadaa to yatra radd
 Then Rahul Baba went to the shelter of Vishwanath
 rahul hon yaa modi, donon kii nazren dilli ke takht par hai
 Now Pooja too has become the same, so what is surprising in this? dilli emsidi chunaav nateezon kii sthiti saaf ho chuki he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has once again captured the MCD by winning a landslide victory
 to vahiin aam aadmi party ko nateezon se baari jhatka laga he
 State President Manoj Tiwari is being given great credit for this victory of BJP, while Amit Shah also congratulated him on the victory
 purvaanchali cheharaa hone ke phayda bijepi ko chunaav main kaaphi mila or aitihaasik jeet darj kii
 Let us tell you that in East Delhi, there are a lot of voters, about 35 percent voters in Delhi are from Purvanchal
 yahi kaaran he ki chunaav main inkaa kaaphi asar rahata he
 In terms of numbers, there are about 40 lakh voters in Purvanchali
 yahi kaaran rahaa he ki bijepi ne bhi inhen saadhane ke liye kai niti apanaain
 Making Manoj Tiwari as president proved to be a trump card for the BJP
 manoj tiwari purv se hai or lokapriy cheharaa hai jiskaa phayda bijepi ko mila he
 Apart from Manoj, Ravikishan also campaigned extensively in the elections
 congress ke samarthak rahe hai purvaanchaliapako bataa den ki dilli main rahane vaale purv ke log paramparaagat rup se congress ke samarthak maane jate rahe hai, lekin pichley vidhansabha chunaav main inkaa yah vot bank inase dur hokar aam aadmi party (aap) ke saath chalaa gaya he
 The Congress had once again tried to link them with itself
 congress party ne nigam chunaav main purvanchal ke 54 kaaryakartaaon ko tikat diya he
 AAP had also put the fact that Purvanchali was the reason for aap's historic victory in the assembly elections, which was why AAP had given tickets to more than 30 Purvanchal candidates in the corporation elections too
 abhi bhi aap ke 14 vidhayak or 2 mantri purvanchal se jude hue hai
 Education makes man self-reliant and accountable to society
 lekin samskruti kisi manushya ko sochane kii shakti detaa he
 Without culture, social structure cannot be imagined
 darasal vakt ke saath samaaj main bhi badlaav aate gaya
 Even though technological communication dominates in modern society, the root of culture is still strong
 khaskar bhartiya samskruti kii baat karen to samaaj ko kai maukon par bikharaav kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 But the root of the culture is so deep that despite all the variations in the society, the door of solidarity does not get loose
 samaaj main har saal nayaa badlaav aata he or ham aap use sweekaar karte hai, bhale hi sweekaarta kaa maapdand sabakaa alag-alag hota he
 The year 2016 is also a box of memories in terms of society and culture
 samaaj main kai badlaav dekhne ko mili jisase samskruti kii door or majboot hokar insaani hausale ko badhaane kaa kaam kiya
 The position of women in Indian society is not hidden
 saalon se mahilaon ke saath ho rahiparadhako rokane ke liye kade kanoon se lekar samaajik chetana kii baaten hoti aa rahi hai
 But there is no change in the situation which strengthens the social structure
 tamaam adchanon or virodhon ke baavjood saal 2016 mahila ke liye behad khaas rahaa
 The steps taken in the direction of women empowerment led to better results
 samskruti kii door itani majboot sabit hui ki nyaayalay ne bhi apane faisle main samaaj or samskruti ke zikr kiye
 There are many living examples of this
 shanishinganapur mandir main mahilaon kii entribadalte samaaj or majboot samskruti kaa hi asar tha ki mandir ke daravaaje mahilaon ke liye khol die gaye
 The law also had to bow to the demands of a changing society
 siyasat se lekar adaalat tak ne apane faisle main samaaj or samskruti ko nazarandaaj nahin kar paaya
 The women made their demand clear that if Indian culture does not ban them from going inside the temple, then they should get their rights
 maang jor pakadi auki sarkaar ko hastkshep karnaa padaa
 The court also ruled in favor of women, referring to the social structure in its judgment
 dargah ke andar tak pahunchi mahilaayembadlaav kii jab shuruyaat hoti he to phir samaaj kaa har tabaka usamen shaamil ho jaataa he
 As soon as the opening of the Shanishinganapur temple women, Muslim women decided to visit the famous Haji Ali Dargah in Mumbai and the demand started to catch up
 lakh virodh ke baavjood isi samaaj ne virodh ko nazarandaaj kar mahilaon ke sammaan main faisla diya
 Because our culture allows that women have equal rights
 phir parampara ke naam par kanoon se samaaj ko nahin jakadaaa ja saktaa
 Not only this, the entry of women in the Dargah strengthened the grip of society and culture
 is maamle main lambey samay se kanoonee ladaai chal rahi thi
 The dargah management said that women are not allowed to enter
 kanoonee ladaai jeetne ke baad mahilaon ne pehali baar dargah main pravesh kiya
 In the world of sports, not women's entry to the mosque-mosque, women showed their strength in the biggest Mahakumbh of sports in 2016
 olympic main sakshi malik, pi ve sandhu or deepika karmakar ne aise pradarshan kiye ki desh kaa seenaa garv se chaudaa ho gaya
 Performing better than men, it raised the value of the country, it was the girls who kept the Indian traditions while living in the walls of the house
 lekin isi samaaj se mili sikh or samskruti se unhen is kadar hausalawan banaaya ki duniya dekhati rah gai
 The decision to ban alcohol in Bihar is well known that no one is good with alcohol, and it is a curse for society
 lekin is par pabandi kaa faisla bhi aam nahin tha
 In a state like Bihar where raw liquor was prepared in the streets of the village
 pichde ilaake khaskar adivasee bahul ilaakon main to sharaab ko samskruti kaa hissaa mana jaataa tha
 In such a situation it was not easy to ban it completely
 ek bada tabaka is virodh main swar uthaa rahaa tha
 But when the government decided to ban this, then it came to save society and culture
 aaj kii taarikh main un ilaake ke log sharaab ko bhul chuke hai jinaki subah kii shuruyaat sharaab se hoti thi
 Behind this decision is the important contribution of the changing society and culture
 adaalat tak bhi maamla pahunchaa lekin jeet sharaab mukt bhartiya samskruti kii hui
 a few of the films of Indian culture which appeared in the films of 2016, saw a glimpse of Indian society and culture
 film sultan main abhinetri anoushka sharma akhaade main purushon ke saath daanv lagaati dikhin
 But when it came to society and culture, he decided to say goodbye to the game to give birth to the innocent in his womb
 bhale hi ye film kaa hissaa tha lekin ye takatein hamen samaaj or samskruti se milti he
 The film was a mirror to the changing society
 notebandi kaa bada faislaazad bharat ke itihaas main aarthik tarakkee ke naam par notebandi kaa faisla liya gaya
 Every section was affected by this decision
 vaise to kalaadhan or bhrashtachar par lagaam ke liye ye kadam uthaae gaye
 This decision of the government was opposed even at the political level
 lekin saamaajik str par pehle din se hi samarthan mila
 Because India society and culture has always been against such people who are involved in black money and corruption
 haalanki vyavastha main gadabadi kii vajah se logon ne dhire-dhire faisle ko lekar sawaal uthaane lage
 But his patience did not break even after standing in line outside the bank for hours
 sarkaar ne bhi faisle ko bhartiya samskruti se jodakar bataaya taaki samaaj main iskaa pratikul asar naa pade
 Even after millions of problems people could say that it is a matter of time and then the situation will become normal
 ye takat keval bhartiya samaaj or samskruti se mil sakati he kyonki isaki jaden behad majboot hai

 Until October 2009, when the investigation into the aarushi-hemraj double murder case was submitted to a special investigation team headed by AGL Kaul, there was no theory of golf sticks
 vishesh jaanch dal ne kaha ki dow
 Rajesh Talwar brutally strikes both with a golf stick after Aarushi's room finds her and servant Hemraj in an objectionable position
 unhone aarushi ke maathe par or hemraj ke sir par prahaar kiya
 Dr
 rajesh or dow
 Nupur has been convicted for the murder of 14-year-old daughter Aarushi and servant Hemraj at his Noida residence on 15–16 May 2008
 sibiai ne kaha ki aarushi ke maathe par angreji ke ve akshar (V) jaisaa chot kaa nishaan golf club kii chot se hi ho saktaa tha, kyonki yah nishaan golf stick kii sataha se prahaar karne par hui chot se miltaa tha
 Doctors who performed autopsies of the dead bodies of Aarushi and Hemraj, Suni Dohar and Dr
 naresh raaj ne nishkarsh nikaala ki mritkon kii chot sambhavat: golf stick kii vajah se thi
 To prove this theory, the Special Investigation Team on 25 September 2009, Dr
 mohinder singh daahiya se sampark kiya
 The team also presented Dr
 of the Gujarat Forensic Science University
 daahiya se aparaadh sthal ke vishleshan par ek report taiyaar karne ke liye kaha

 Dahiya also said that Aarushi and Hemraj were murdered on Aarushi's bed
 is report ke aadhaar par sibiai ke jaanch dal ne 29 aktubar 2009 ko talwaar dampati ko notice bhejkar golf stick pesh karne ko kaha
 The next day, the Talwar couple presented a dozen golf sticks
 sibiai ne sabhi ko sil kar diya
 The CBI also cited the investigation of CFSL scientist DK Tanwar
 tanvar ne paaya ki jaanch ke dauraan do golf stick (lohe kii golf club sankhya 4 or lakdi kii golf club sankhya 5) anya kii tulana main saaf thim
 According to CBI theory, the accused had cleaned the alleged weapon of murder to destroy evidence

 sabase maasoom haivaan ke gunahon kaa hisaab jaanane ke liye abhi aapako kuch or intazaar karnaa padegaa
 Yes, innocent as well as proud
 maasoom isliye kyonki kaanoon kii najar main wo bada kahalaane se sirf 170 din chota rah gaya
 And Havan because he is the best criminal gang rape and murder case ever
 juvenil justise board ko uski takadir par guuruuvaar ko faisalaa sunaanaa tha, jisamen gunaah sabit hone par zyaada se zyaada teen saal kii sajaa hoti
 But now for the first justice of 16 December, we have to wait till 25 July
 julm to ghante bhar kaa tha
 The pain is also a bit late and the lust may be just a moment
 phir jaan bhi ek hi gai
 So why so much uproar? Why is there so much hue and cry about justice before 16 December? No rape, gang rape or murder has happened in this country before or after December 16? What has happened at all and is still happening today
 par 16 disambar kii raat ko us ghante bhar ke julm, kuch der kii darindagi or pal bhar kii havas ne pehali baar 23 saal kii us ladki ke dard ko puure desh kaa dard bana diya tha
 She died every day for 13 days and the country mourned for 13 days
 or 13 din baad jab wo sachmuch mar gai to hindustan ke har ghar ko laga jaise ye uskaa apana matam ho
 And just because of this the entire nation's eyes were lost on this first decision of 16 December
 kamaal he, 16 disambar kii us khaufnak raat kaa sabase bada haivaan wo
 He is the biggest devil in the gang rape that shakes the whole country
 sharaab pine kii umr uski
 Understanding of manipulating him
 rape karne kii havas usamen
 Hearing the story of his poor, children themselves start to fear the night
 par use uski darindagi kii puri sajaa nahin di ja sakati thi
 Because on the night of December 16, 2012, he was 17 years, six months and 11 days old when he was noticing the dignity of a girl on the back seat of the bus as well as her spirit
 ji haa, puraa desh us haadase ke baad dard, gussa aanhon or aansuon se ladata rahaa
 He kept demanding the harshest punishment of gang-rapes
 maangen maani bhi gayi
 Fast track court was made for quick decision
 lekin sitam dekhie ki jis par us raat sabase zyada jaalim hone kaa iljaam tha, vahi sabase kam sajaa paakar nikal gaya
 Because that night he was a child of 17 years, six months and 11 days
 teen saal, ji haa! faqat teen saal
 This is the maximum punishment for the minor who has raped or murdered in our country
 shuukravaar ko juvenil justise board ko 16 disambar par pehla faisla dena tha
 The first was to be judged, but it was postponed until July 25
 ab 25 july ko faisla hoga ki us 17 saal chah maheene or 11 din ke bachche ke saath kya kiya jaae? use kitni sajaa di jaae? kisi sajaa di jaae? par jo bhi sajaa hogi wo hogi teen saal ke daayre main hi
 Because even after being convicted, more and more he can get the same punishment
 yani teen saal, wo bhi jail main nahin, kahin or
 Where this too is not clear yet
 kyonki jurm karne ke baad ab ye baccha bada ho gaya he lihaaja bacchon ke saath bhi nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 Just 170 days and the noose hanging from his neck was removed forever
 agar yahi ghinauna jurm usne 170 din baad kiya hota to shartiya is jurm ke liye use umr kaid se lekar faansee tak ho sakati thi, par nahin hui
 Because that night he was 17 years old six months and 11 days old
 gangrape ke is aaropee bachche kii umr skool certificate ke hisaab se 16 disambar yani vaardaat vaali raat 17 saal chah maheene or 11 din thi
 According to the school certificate, this child was born on 4 June 1995
 juvenil justise board ne isi certificate ko saboot maanate hue ise baccha qaraar de diya
 And with this, it has been decided that the 17-year-old and 11-day-old child will not be prosecuted under the IPC sections along with the remaining five accused of gangrape
 or is tarah gangrape kaa ye chatha aaropee sirf 170 dinon kii vajah se batch gaya
 On June 4 this year, after completing 170 days, this child has grown up and grown up
 par kya kiijie, kanoon kii najar main phir bhi wo baccha hi rahaa
 Because the law is measuring his age from the day he committed the crime
 or jurm kii us raat yani 16 disambar ko wo 17 saal chah maheene or 11 din kaa baccha tha

 sonia gandhi ke 19 saal ke baad 16 disambar ko rahul ne congress kii kaman sanbhali
 During Sonia Gandhi's tenure, the oldest party in the country remained in power for 10 years, but nothing good was happening for the party in the last 3 years and not only its condition at the center deteriorated but its power from the states one by one

 Rahul commanded the Congress during the Gujarat elections and campaigned in an aggressive manner, presenting himself as a strong leader
 gujarat chunaav se pehle unhen raajnneeti main nausikhia samajha jaataa tha or vipakshi unka jamkar majaak udaate the
 But now the time has changed, he has become the president of the Congress and the party has high hopes from him
 rahul kaa adhyaksh pad par asin hona congress ke liye abhi tak behad shandaar dikh rahaa he
