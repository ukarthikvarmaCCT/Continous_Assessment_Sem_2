 45 rupee kaa tikat lekar train kii general bogi main baithkar dilli pahunchnaa bhi is buzurg ke liye aasaan nahin tha, lekin train ke is mushkil safar se bhi zyaada zaruri tha, 10,500 rupee ke puraane note badalanaa
 
 
 After working in a school for 40 years, he now gets a pension of only 500 rupees
 
 
 
 The old man says, after demonetisation all the old notes that were in the house were replaced, but some notes were kept in a carton of items of worship to protect them from thieves, and they were forgotten
 
 
 niyamon ke hisaab se ab ye note nahin badale ja sakate, kyonki 31 disambar ke baad se reserve bank main sirf enarai (apravasi bhartiya) ke note badale ja rahe hai
 
 
 Even after knowing that he cannot change his notes, this elder has not given up hope, and now he wants to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 
 
 baar-baar kehete hai, "maine modi ji ko vot diya he, unke liye vot maanga bhi he
 
 
 i will meet him, talk to him, i have his secretary's number
 
 
 " On the way he said, "I am going to meet Modi ji
 
 
 " jab maine poocha ki kya modi ji aapse milenge, to jawaab mila, "kyon nahin milenge

 Some of them came from Uttar Pradesh, some from Bihar
 
 
 desh ke alag-alag konon se aae log apane-apane puraane note badalane reserve bank pahunche hai, lekin note nahin badale ja rahe hai
 
 
 Like these elderly, 90-year-old Jamrat from Haryana's Mewat district has come to exchange notes with her husband, but the result is the same
 
 
 ek ped ke neeche baithi hai, or baar-baar yahi kah rahi hai ki vah bhul gai thim ki unke paas kuch puraane note ab bhi batch gaye hai
 
 
 She has also brought an affidavit from the sarpanch of her village, stating that Jumrat hails from Autha village in Haryana, is 90 years old and has got old notes of Rs 23,000 while cleaning the house
 
 
 jumrat or unka parivaar behad garib he, so, kripaya inke note badal die jaaen
 
 
 But the RBI rules are definitely more powerful than the sarpanch's affidavit, so now the gumrat does not know what to do with these notes
 
 
 baar-baar puch rahi hai ki kya kar sakati hai, lekin jawaab kisi ke paas nahin he
 
 
 This is Ramkumar, who hails from Madhya Pradesh and works as a laborer
 
 
 ramkumar 44,000 rupee ke puraane noton ke saath reserve bank ke saamne paanch din se maujuud hai
 
 
 In fact, Ramkumar's father died a few days ago, and when he went to the bank to get his old age pension closed, the bankers asked for passbooks, and these old notes popped up in Dad's box, looking for passbooks at home
 
 
 iske baad ramkumar ne pita kaa mrityu praaanpatr banavaakar bhopal kaa rasta pakadaa, lekin vahaan note nahin badal paae, to unhen bhi dilli aana padaa
 
 
 It has been circling the Reserve Bank for five days now, but the result is the same as it is for everyone else
 
 
 ramkumar kaa kahana he ki yah rakam unke pitaaji kii kamai he, or pitaaji ne kisi ko iske bare main nahin bataaya tha
 
 
 If he had told it earlier, he would have changed it already
 
 
 reserve bank ke saamne ek or mahila bhi milin, jo kai anya kii tarah ro rahi hai
 
 
 In fact, a few days ago her 12-year-old daughter died after an illness, which she could not change the notes due to the treatment
 
 
 vah bhi sabhi se puuchhati phir rahi hai ki vah in noton kaa ab kya karen
 
 
 The comments nazangarh ke rahane vaale tiwari ji bhi apane 16,000 rupee badalawaane ke liye kai din se chakkar kaat rahe hai
 
 
 His wife had gone to Gonda, and when she returned, she told about the 16,000 rupee notes she had kept with her
 
 
 lekin tab tak der ho chuki thi, or aam janata ke liye reserve bank main bhi puraane noton ko badalanaa band kar diya gaya tha
 
 
 After this, Tiwari wrote a letter to the Prime Minister, in which he explained his problem
 
 
 lekin ab tiwari ji gusse main hai, kyonki na unke khat kaa koi jawaab aayaa he, na unke note badale ja rahe hai
 
 
 Tiwari ji is also repeatedly talking about setting these notes on fire
 
 
 reserve bank ke saamne maujuud pareshaan logon ko media se bhi shikaayatein hai
 
 
 By the way, people of the general public were narrating their own problems as soon as they saw the media, but the problem is also happening to nris
 
 
 bahuton ko yahi nahin pataa ki unhen koun-koun se dastauez lekar aane hai
 
 
 Some of these were also upset with the media
 
 
 unka kahana tha, ve log kai-kai din se line main khadey hai, or note nahin badal paa rahe hai, lekin media ne yah sab katai nahin dikhaaya
 
 
 Some even alleged that the media has been sold, and they only see the goodness of the government and not the problems of the poor
 
 
 dilli sthit reserve bank of india (arabiai) ke saamne rajasthan ke jhunjhunuun se aae buzurg rote-rote apni ramakahani bayaan kar rahe the
 
 
 Jhunjhunu is located at a distance of about 200 km from Delhi, but for this old man, his hard-earned money is more important than distance

 According to the rules, these notes cannot be changed now, since only the NRI (NRI) notes are being replaced in the Reserve Bank since 31 December

 The assembly elections held in 5 states of the country were being seen as the semi-finals of 2019
 in rajyon ke nattejey bhi siyaasi tufaan uthaane vaale rahe
 Especially the results of the three bjp-ruled states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are showing alarm bells for the BJP ahead of the 2019 elections
 13 sitambar 2013 ko bijepi ne gujarat ke siem narendra modi ko 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banane kaa elaan kiya tha
 After this, the BJP went on a nationwide campaign
 3 rajya jitkar shuru hui thi modi laharmodi ko bijepi kaa siyaasi cheharaa banane ke elaan ke baad disambar 2013 main chaar rajyon main chunaav hue
 Out of which three states Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh came to power with overwhelming majority whereas in Delhi, despite good performance the government could not form
 2015 main phir dilli main chunaav hue or 70 siton main se aam aadmi party ko 67 siten milin
 Delhi's mandate went against both BJP and Congress
 congress dilli chunaav main khaataa bhi nahin khol saki
 But BJP won the victory of three states
 iske baad siyaasi galiyaaron main modi lahar kii charchaa chaa gai
 The BJP came to power with a thumping majority after winning the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and for the first time in 30 years a party formed a government at its own
 phir ek-ek kar 21 rajyon main bijepi or sahyogi dalon kii sarkarein baniin
 The entire credit for this victory was given to Modi Magic
 congress harati gai or badhata gaya modi kaa graphbata den ki pichley loksabhaa chunaav main manmohan singh ke netritv vaali upie sarkaar ke khilaaf jabardast satta virdohi lahar dekhne ko mili thi
 Due to various scams including 2G spectrum, coal block allocation and Commonwealth Games, people voted against Manmohan Singh and under the leadership of Narendra Modi, BJP was handed over the power of the country
 modi lahar se congress mukt bharat ke sapane takadesh ke jin rajyon main sattarudh dal ke khilaaf janadesh gaya, unamem adhikansh rajyon main congress satta par kabiz thi
 In such a situation, the Grand Old Party faced an anti-incumbency wave in many states
 isi ke chalate congress ko kai rajyon main apni satta ganvaani padi thi
 Assembly elections were held in Maharashtra, Haryana, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 in sabhi rajyon main congress kii sarkarein thim or use satta virdohi lahar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The same happened in the Karnataka elections, although the Congress formed the government with the JDS
 bijepi ko karnaa pad rahaa satta virdohi lahar kaa saamanalagataar jeet ke silsile ke baad ab bijepi ko bhi satta virdohi lahar kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Gorakhpur, Phulpur, Kairana Lok Sabha by-elections, besides a difficult victory in Gujarat
 phir karnataka kii haar or rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh kii shikast modi magic ke vijay rath par brake lagaataa dikh rahaa he

 Mulayam Singh is caught in a dilemma here like Dasharatha of Ramayana
 dasharath kii tarah mulaayam yahaan apane aap ko duusari patni sadhana or akhilesh ke bich main fansaa hua paa rahe hai
 According to insiders, the role of Sadhana is believed to be behind the drama of the Yadav family
 yani ki sadhana yahaan ramayana kii kaikeyi ke kirdaar main hai
 Few people would have known Sadhana before 2003, when Mullati Yadav, the first wife of Mullayam Singh and mother of Akhilesh, passed away
 isi saal sadhana ko mulaayam kii patni kaa darja mila
 However, it is not clear when the two married
 mulaayam singh or sadhana kaa ek betaa he

 pratik kehete hai ki unki raajnneeti main koi dilchaspee kai aarope lagaate hai ki sadhana mulaayam ko akhilesh ke khilaaf khadaa karne main lage hui hai
 The plot begins in 2012, the real story begins in 2012, when the SP comes to power with an absolute majority
 sadhana or shivpal chaahate the ki akhilesh mukhyamantri naa bane, mulaayam singh hi netritv karen
 But Mulayam Singh handed over the power to Akhilesh
 haal hi party se barkhaast hue udaiveer singh ne aarope lagaaya tha ki 2012 main sadhana ne sapa netaaon ko lamaband karne kii koshish kii, jisase akhilesh ko dur rakhaa ja sake
 Sadhana still wants to do the same
 vah nahin chaahatin ki 2017 main bhi akhilesh hi party kaa cheharaa hon
 Akhilesh, who is close to Amar Singh, believes that Amar Singh is close to Sadhana and he is explained to him by political bravado
 akhilesh amar singh ko party main nahin chaahate hai
 It is believed that due to Sadhana, Amar Singh returned to the party

 buudhvaar ko samaajawaadee party main ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa hone ke baad ye saaf ho gaya ki tikat ke maamle main shivpal yadav apane bhattije or mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav par kaaphi baari paden hai
 People close to Shivpal Yadav got tickets while Akhilesh Yadav's favorite cards were cleared
 kaha ja rahaa he ki samaajawaadee party main tikat bantwaare ko lekar chachaa-bhatija ke bich yuddh part-2 shuru ho saktaa he
 Aaj Tak had a special conversation with Shivpal Yadav about the tussle over ticket distribution
 tikat bantwaare main apni dhak jamaane ke bare main puche jane par shivpal yadav kaa jawaab tha ki jo bhi tikat die gaye hai sab mulaayam singh yadav kii marji se hi die gaye hai or isamen sabaki sahmati he
 Regarding the list of Akhilesh Yadav, Shivpal said that not only the Chief Minister, but all the people have also submitted their own list to the party President Mulayam Singh
 mulaayam sihan sabaki sunate hai, lekin unka faisla antim he or samaajawaadee party main koi bhi us par sawaal nahin uthaa saktaa
 It is also being said that Akhilesh is angry about giving tickets to criminals like Atik Ahmed
 lekin yah puche jane par shivpal yadav kaa saaf kahana tha ki unka makasad he jeetne vaale logon ko tikat dilaanaa or phir se samaajawaadee party kii sarkaar bananaa
 When asked if it was okay to take criminals for this, Shivpal Yadav's reply was that all parties would have to talk together for this
 saath hi wo ye bhi jodte hai kismajawaadee partikabhi bhi aparaadhiyon ko badhaava nahin detii
 Everyone's eyes are now on what Akhilesh Yadav does after not getting tickets to his people
 kya unke samarthak baagi hokar chunaav ladenge? ye puche jane par shivpal kehete hai ki party or sanghathan se bada koi nahin hota or jo log party chhodkar gaye hai, unhone dekha he ki kya hota he
 He believes that a true socialist will never do this
 mulaayam singh yadav ne buudhvaar ko phir kaha ki samaajawaadee party kaa gathbandhan kisi se nahin hoga
 But Shivpal, when asked about this, says that if alliances are not done properly then the matter deteriorates instead of being formed
 isliye unki party gathbandhan se hichak rahi he
 The second reason is that so far no responsible leader of Congress party has spoken to him nor to Mulayam Singh Yadav

 piem modi ko kam se kam us blocade kaa zikr karnaa chahie or aashwast karnaa chahie ki aisi sthiti phir kabhi nahimbanane di jaaegi
 Apart from the situation arising out of the blockade, what will be the impact on the relationship between the two countries due to the promotion of Ramayana circuit and religious tourism from India? In response to this question, Dr

 iske baad bihar sarkaar ne maamle kii sibiai se jaanch karaane kii anushansa kii thi
 Chandrashekhar came into the limelight due to his campaign against corruption and criminalization in politics

 Later Kaushalya Devi was killed

 (from input language) loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke nattejey to 23 may ko aaenge, lekin isse pehle aae tamaam agsit pole ke mutabik centre main endie kii sarkaar banati dikh rahi he
 While the Congress-led UPA seems completely unsuccessful
 yahi nahin uttar pradesh main modi ke vijay rath ko rokane ke liye varshon puraani dushmani bhulaakar saath aae sapa-basapa gathbandhan ko bahut kam siten milane kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 In such a situation, there is speculation about whether the future of Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav's alliance will continue or not
 agsit pole ke nattejeyajtak-exis maai india agsit pole ke mutabik upi kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se bijepi gathbandhan ko 62-68 siten milti hui najar aa rahi hai
 While the SP-BSP-RLD alliance is expected to get 10 to 16 seats and the Congress 1 to 2 seats
 bijepi ko akele dam par 60 se 66 siten or apana dal ko 2 siten mil sakati hai
 Whereas SP seems to get 4 to 7 seats and BSP gets 3 to 7 seats
 vahiin, congress ko ek se do siten milane kaa anumaan he
 In Uttar Pradesh, the SP-BSP alliance was described by the leaders of both parties as a historic step
 aise main mana ja rahaa tha ki mayawati or akhilesh milakar bijepi ko bada nuksaan karne vaale hai
 But according to all the surveys including Aaj tak-axis My India exit poll, the alliance seems to be completely failing
 is agsit pole main endie ko pichley chunaav nateezon ke kareeb hi dikhaaya he
 When rahul-akhilesh missed out, the fate of the alliance between Rahul and Akhilesh after the 2017 assembly elections in Sathsube is in front of everyone
 vahi haal is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav nateezon ke baad akhilesh yadav or mayawati ke gathbandhan kaa hoga isko lekar atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai
 However, Akhilesh Yadav has already said that this alliance will continue not just in the Lok Sabha elections but also in the future
 yahi baat unhone 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress ke liye bhi kahi thi, lekin vah do saal ke baad jab loksabhaa chunaav hue to congress ko gathbandhan kaa hissaa nahin banaaya
 Will the SP-BSP alliance continue even further? Even after the Lok Sabha elections, if the SP-BSP stays together and contests further, one thing will be clear from this that both parties have accepted that the BJP cannot be defeated alone
 yahi nahin iske alaava unhen apane raajnneetik sameekaran ko nae tareeke se bhi banane honge
 Where there are advantages, then you can also face losses
 sapa-basapa ke liye apane cader ko saath jodakar rakhana badi chunauti hogi
 Apart from this, maintaining the morale of the workers will also be a challenge
 agsit pole nateezon ke hisaab se sapa or basapa ne jis makasad se is chunaav ko ladaa vah safal nahin hua
 However tomorrow when the votes will be counted and the alliance managed to harm the BJP, this alliance does not seem to be coming to an end

 - Anand Sharma (@anandsharmainc) June 7, 2018 Why did Pranab not mention Mahatma Gandhi's assassination: Reacting to Pranab da's speech on the Yechury RSS platform, the CPI-M said that if former President Pranab Mukherjee reminded the Sangh its history, Would have been nice is dauraan bhakpa ne bahultavaadi or samgr samaaj ko asal bharat ke rup main ullekith karne ke liye unke bhaashan kii saraahna kii
 CPI (M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury questioned him (pranab Mukherjee) for not mentioning the assassination of Father of the Nation during his speech
 makapa netaa ne twit kiya ki mukherjee ko aresas ko uskaa itihaas yaad dilaanaa chahie tha
 On the other hand, the CPI gave a mixed response, saying that his speech was as expected
 bhakpa netaa di raja ne kaha ki haalanki hamaara maananaa he ki unhen aresas ke kaarykram main nahin janaa chahie tha, lekin pranab da ne apane bhaashan main jo kuch kaha, unase usee kii ummid thim

 PM Modi and Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis also expressed condolences to the people who lost their lives in the footover bridge accident
 piem modi ne twit kiya, 'mumbai main footover brij haadase main logon kii jaan jane se behad aahat hum
 My condolences to the bereaved families

 At the same time, Devendra Fadnavis said, 'I am sad to hear the news of the footover accident near TOI building in Mumbai

 ' pradhanmantri narendra modi ke 'naale kii gas se chaay banane' ke bayaan kii soshal media par kaaphi charchaa ho rahi he
 In such a situation, some people are also sharing about the person who was praised by Modi and they are using the drain gas as LPG
 haalanki aapako bataa den ki desh main kai log is gas ke jariye khaanaa pakaa rahe hai, usamen tamilnadu ke tambaram nigam ke log bhi shaamil he
 These people have been cooking for many years by converting sewer gas into LPG
 da hindu kii ek report ke anusaar, bharat nagar main rahane vaale logon ko muft main iko-frandli gas mil rahi he, jisase wo apane ghar main khaanaa bana rahe hai
 This report by The Hindu is old, but it is being shared back after Modi's statement and people are being asked to adopt this technique through Tambaram people on social media
 scolership ke paison se 14 kaidi chhudvaa rahaa he bhopal kaa aayushbataa den ki tambaram nagar nigam ne ek baio-mathanation plant lagaaya he jo public toilet main siver se gas banaata he
 This novel project is getting good response and has been named Namma Toilet

 With this 12 stoves are lit, which is being taken advantage of by all the people living here
 ye he wo shaks jo naale kii gas se jalaata he chulhaa, PM modi ne kii thi taribais public toilet kaa nirmaan 10 lakh rupee kii laagat se saal 2003 main karavaaya gaya tha
 Officials say that methane gas is produced from sewerage and enters the kitchen through 12 pipes

 It is free for all people
 maharashtra main tabah kisaanon ko raahat pahunchane ke liye jari kii gai madad kii raashi gum-phirakar phir rajya ke khajaane main hi pahunch ja rahi he
 The reason is that farmers have to have a bank account to get help, while many small farmers do not have it
 jaane kisaanon ke muaavje kii puri hakikatmaharashtra sarkaar ne sookhaa prabhavit kisaanon ko raahat dene ke liye fund jari kiya tha
 Instead of reaching the hands of farmers, the funds of Rs 460 crore reached the state government
 darasal, maharashtra main kai aise kisaan hai, jinke paas apana koi bank khaataa nahin he
 The number of such farmers is in lakhs
 ek angreji akhbaar ne yah report chhaapi he
 To get government assistance, it is a necessary condition that the beneficiary should have a bank account, in which money can be transferred
 aise main kisaanon ke saamne ek or sankat khadaa ho gaya he
 Many such cases have also been seen, because of the dispute between the farmers could not help, but in most of the cases, the bank account itself is proving to be a 'roadblock'
 gauratlab he ki maharashtra sarkaar saal 2014 se vittiya sahaayta nakad raashi kii bajaae bainkon ke jariye de rahi he, jisase dhaandhlee roki ja sake
 All the parties are campaigning strongly for the Lok Sabha Election 2019

 Now the Congress party has reached the Election Commission regarding this matter
 kanges ne tivi dharawahikon main bijepi kaa prachaar kiye jane ke khilaaf aachaar samhita ke ulanghan kaa aarope lagaaya he
 In the complaint letter, the Congress has demanded registration of a case against the BJP along with the makers and actors of tv's popular show 'bhabhi Ji Ghar Par Hain' and 'tujhse Hai Raabta'
 congress ne iske khilaaf ped news ke tahat karrwai karne ke saath dharawahik band karne kii maang bhi kii he

 rajeev gandhi 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main bhi praasangik hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi had earlier launched a scathing attack on him as corrupt number one, but it seems that Modi's arrows have not finished yet
 ab, 8 may ko nai dilli ke ramlila maidan main apane bhaashan main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki rajeev gandhi ne apane parivaar or doston ke picnic ke liye vimaanvaahi pot ienes viraat kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Let us examine the genuineness of this claim (or accusation)
 asal main, saal 1987 ke disambar main rajeev gandhi 36 tapuon or 44 hajaar kii aabaadi vaale lakshadweep main bangaaram tapu gaye the
 Which was a deserted place with an area of half a square kilometer
 yah tapu samrik rup se behad mahatvapurn he or yah lakshadweep kaa ekmaatr tapu he jahaan videshiyon ko jane kii chhot he
 And there is no prohibition here
 rajeev gandhi ke is dweep par hue daure kii reportindia tudeke 31 janvari, 1988 ke ank main vistrut rup se tasveeron ke saath chhapi thi
 India Today Journalist Anita Pratap has reached Lakshadweep, wrote that although all possible efforts were made to allow an outsider to reach during Rajiv's visit, the journalists reached out
 asal main, media ke liye yah aakarshan kaa centre tab ban gaya jab 26 disambar, 1987 ko naarangi or safed rang ke helicopter se rahul gandhi or unke chaar dost utre
 After that, the squares became a series
 sarkari mashinari ne patrakaron ko yahaan se dur rakhane main puraa jor laga diya
 Among those visiting the island are four friends of Rahul and Priyanka, sister of Sonia Gandhi, brother-in-law and widow mother of her daughter, Sonia
 mino or bhai tathaa mamaa bhi the
 Also there were Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, and their children (shweta and Abhishek)
 saath main ajitabh (amitabh ke bhai) kii bitiyaa bhi thi
 Among the remaining guests, there were only two Hindustani, Arjun Singh's brother Bijendra Singh and his wife
 baaki sabhi log videshi the
 Rajiv and Sonia arrive in the afternoon of 30 December
 par amitabh bachchan ko lekar vishesh cochin-kavaratti udaan par aayaa helicopter 31 taarikh ko pahunchaa
 Perhaps, its goal was to keep Amitabh's presence there
 par bhed khul gaya kyonki helicopter ko bangaaram pahunchane se pehle kavaratti tapu par eendhan lene ke liye 50 minute ke liye ruknaa padaa tha or tab vahaan se vaapasi main cochin hawaii adde par indian express ke photographer ne unhen dekh liya or amitabh kii gusse bhari chetavaniyon ke baavjood unke chaar photo khinch liye
 However, a week-long holiday took place on that island
 india today main anitha pratap likhti hai, is baat kaa anumaan lagaana kathin he ki saal ke ant main hue is tamaashe par kul kitna kharch aayaa hoga
 Because many agencies have spent their own way on this
 masalan, khaane kaa kharch manoranjan, paryaton or jal sambandhi khelon ke vikaas sanghathan sports ne kii thi
 For this occasion, a special form of 100 hens was established in Agatti
 par asli baat yah rahi ki desh ke pramukh yudhpot iesces viraat kaa istemaal rajeev gandhi ke parivaar kii sawari ke liye kiya gaya or is dauraan yah 10 din tak arab sagar main hi ghumta rahaa
 Anita writes, The expenditure on this warship is incalculable because wherever it goes, a convoy of security ships goes along with it
 khabar thi ki is kaam ke liye vahaan ek pandubbi bhi tainaat kii gai thi
 In addition, special satellite communication connectivity was also provided at Agatti
 6 janvari ke din jab yah picnic khatm hui tab vahaan se sabase pehle priyanka or unke saathi goa ke liye nikle
 After them, foreign elderly people left and then Amitabh and his family
 usee din dopaher 1
 At 20, Rajiv left in a helicopter with Rahul
 amino main 1988 ko apane sabase pehle kaarykram main bhaag lene se pehle rajeev ne rahul ko iesces viraat par utaara taaki vah baad main mangalore tak saath yatra kar saken
 However, it is certain that Rajiv Gandhi used an aircraft of the country for his personal outing and kept the entire battle fleet with him
 saath main ek pandubbi kii bhi duty thi, par shaayad pradhanmantri modi iskaa zikr karnaa shaayad bhul hi gaye
 *** dilli ke paas gajiabad main badmaashon or police ke bich muthbhed ho gai he
 When the miscreants going on scooty stopped the police at the Sihani Gate area, they started firing
 police ne bhi peechha karte hue javaabi firing kii, jisamen ek badmaash pakadaa gaya, doosraa faraar ho gaya
 Police have recovered Scooty, a pistol and a pistol

 He is a member of a registered gang called D-50 in Loni
 vijaynagar kii kashiram awasaiya yojana ke raste se guzar rahe ek shaks ke saath in badmaashon ne lutpaat kaa prayaas kiya
 Police surrounded the miscreants as soon as the information was received
 sihani get thana kshetra ke lohia nagar main police muthbhed ho gai
 It involves shooting a crook and a policeman
 donon ko aspataal main admit karaayaa gaya he
 The police is now on the lookout for the crook's other partner
 sihani get thana kshetra ke posh ilaake lohia nagar main yah muthbhed hui he
 The crooks are not averse to firing on the police, but the police have also determined that the bullet is their real cure
 bataate chalem ki uttar pradesh main badmaashon kii shamat aa gai he
 UP police is in action regarding criminals
 oparation 'olout' ke mod main karrwai karte hue upi police ne kuch din pehle 72 ghante main 24 encounter kar daale, jisamen 36 kukhyat aparaadhiyon ko salaakhon ke peeche pahunchaa diya gaya, jabaki 3 inami badmaash dher kar die gaye
 It was told that within 3 days, there were tremendous encounters between the police and the miscreants in 15 districts of UP, the most number of encounters were in Shamli, three in Encounterbulandshahr, while two encounters were held in Kanpur, Muzaffarnar, Saharanpur and capital Lucknow
 muthbhedon ke dauraan badmaashon ke paas se badi maatra main hathiyaar bhi baraamad kiye gaye
 Four dacoits of the Bavaria gang, which have become synonymous with terror, were arrested, while in the second two dacoits have been shot
 yah donon baavariyaa gang se jude dakait hai
 The miscreants whose work has been done by the police in these encounters, were rewarded with a reward ranging from 10 thousand to 50 thousand and many sensational cases were registered
 kaarykaal ke aakhri padaav par khadi narendra modi sarkaar se jahaan aam aadmi se lekar choti-badi industry aas lagaakar baithi hai vahiin chunautiyon ke daur se guzar rahi bhartiya film industry bhi ummiido kaa pulinda baandh rakhaa he
 Some demands of the film industry have been pending for a long time
 haalanki satta ke sheersh par industry leaders kii pradhanmantri modi se sidhi baat ke baad kai riyaayaten milane kii khabar bhi saamne bhi ai
 The Modi government recently provided a major relief to GST for the film industry
 lekin industry kii ummiido kaa tital abhi bhi "dil maange mor" he
 After the introduction of GST across the country in July 2017, all tickets above Rs 100 for the film industry received a major blow from the highest 28 per cent tax provision
 digital daur main industry pehle se hi demand se jujh rahi thi, or tex main hue ijaphe kii vajah se darshakon ko cinema haal tak kheenchna behad mushkil ho gaya
 It was seen that in addition to GST in Tamil Nadu, a state which is very important for the Indian entertainment industry, it started charging 48% higher tax in the name of 'local Body Entertainment Tax' on tickets for all non-tamil films
 cinemagharon ke tikat daron par lagane vaale jiesti main katautee kii maang sarkaar sweekaar kar chuki he
 In recent times, Prime Minister Modi has met many filmmakers and actors
 mumbai main bhartiya cinema ke sangrahalay ke udghaatan ke dauraan bhi modi ne film nirmaan se judi tamaam hastiyon se baat kii thi
 The political gain of the BJP was also seen in these meetings
 kavayad ko lekar ek dhade ne yah bhi mana ki ye khaas taur par aane vaale chunaav main sitaron kii bhoomika kaa istemaal kar vot batorne kii koshish bhi he
 On the other hand, the industry also seems to be trying to serve its interests by accessing the corridors of power
 vyavsaayik lihaaj se uski kai samasyaayein jaij bhi hai
 In spite of all this, the increased cost after GST is an important issue in film production
 jiesti kaa prabhaav film nirmaan ke prayek paksh par padaa he
 Most of the services like hotel booking, traffic, resources, locations, shooting rights are now making film making expensive
 lihaaja film nirmaataaon kii maang he ki sarkaar film production ke paksh ko dhyaan main rakhte hue 2016 main nirmit neshnal ipiar policy ke praavdhaan ko jald se jald lagu kare
 Although the film industry has got the status of industry earlier, now it is expected to get relief from the provisions of Ease of Doing Business
 film jagat kii maang he ki kisi anya kaarobaar kii tarj par film jagat ke liye bhi film clearence, broadcasting parmishan or shooting or screen building ke liye single windo clearence kii suvidha di jaae

 You may be surprised to know that there were only 4 riots in Uttar Pradesh in the two years of Akhilesh Yadav government
 yah daawa khud pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne sadan main kiya
 Interestingly, earlier, the government had released 27 riots in a year and a half
 darasal maamle ne tool tab pakadaa jab vidhansabha ki kaarywahi ke dauraan bijepi ne sarkaar se sawaal karte hue ab tak pradesh main hue sampradayik dangon kaa hisaab maanga
 The government replied that after the formation of the SP government, a total of 4 communal riots took place in the state in which 56 people died and around 136 people were seriously injured
 sarkaar ke is jawaab ke baad pramukh vipakshi dal bahujan samaaj party ne sadan ke bheetar jamkar hangaamaa shuru kar diya
 BSP leader Swami Prasad Maurya said, '27 riots answer is right or 4 riots? According to IB report, if the figure of 115 riots is correct then naturally the Samajwadi Party government is committing the sin of protecting itself
 'vahiin bijepi ne aarope lagaaya ki sampradayik sadbhaav ko bigaadane waalon ko sarkaar kaa sangrakshan praapt he isliye sarkaar ne spasht jawaab nahin diya
 The Congress also objected to the response to the communal riots
 congress ne kaha ki isi sapa sarkaar ne pehle saal isi sadan main 27 sampradayik dangon kii baat sweekaar kii he or ab chaar dange bataae ja rahe hai or uttar pradesh kii sarkaar janata ko gumraah kar rahi he
 The Samajwadi Party, which has faced aggressive opposition from the House, now seems to be surviving on the question of communal riots
 party kaa daawa he ki jawaab vahin diya jaataa he jo sawaal poocha jaataa he
 Everyday new figures are being released about the riots in Uttar Pradesh

 Reddy's surprise change is seen as he was part of the YSR Congress delegation headed by party chief YS Jaganmohan Reddy to meet future Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Rajnath Singh
 haalanki aisi bhi khabaren thim, ki wiesar congress kaa koi anya saansad tedepa main shaamil hua he lekin is bare main koi bhi aadhikarik pushti nahin hui
 Meanwhile, the YSR Congress leader and MP told Hyderabad that there was no idea that Reddy would join the TDP

 Gopinath Munde, who rose from an ordinary farmer family to Union Minister for Rural Development, worked as a bridge with other parties in the state and became the bjp's tallest leader in Maharashtra after the death of his brother-in-law Pramod Mahajan
 maharashtra bhaajapa main vah tab tak sheersh par bane rahe, jab tak ki unke purv mantrimandaleey kanishtha sahyogi (1994-99) nitin gadakari 2009 main bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh nahin ban gaye
 Munde, the third of five children of a middle-class peasant family in Parali in Beed district, a backward area of maharashtra, attended a modest government school where classes were run under trees
 uske baad unhone jilastareey hiskool main daakhila liya or baad main ambejogai main ek college se snaatak kii oopaadhi hasil kii
 During college days, Munde met the soft-spoken Pramod Mahajan, who encouraged Munde to join the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad
 baad main 1975-1977 ke apatkaal ke dauraan vah lagbhag teen varsh tak aresas ke kaaryakarta ke rup main jail main rahe
 Munde's political debut began when he attended a training camp at the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in Pune and then became a member of the executive committee of the Pune unit of the RSS
 1980 tak janata party gathbandhan tuutane ke kagaar par tha, or purv bhartiya jansangh ke sthaan par bhaajapa kaa udai ho rahaa tha
 The same year Munde was made the president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party Yuva Morcha and was also elected as an MLA in Maharashtra
 munde kii mahajan se dosti us samay paariwarik rishte main badal gai, jab unhone mahajan kii bahan pradanya mahajan se shaadi kii
 The two have three daughters, including Pankaja munde-palve, a member of the state assembly, elected from her home constituency, Parali

 He held this position till March 1995

 When Manohar Joshi of Shiv Sena became the Chief Minister of the state, Munde was made Deputy Chief Minister and Home Minister
 lekin 1999 ke chunaav main yah gathbandhan dobaaraa jeet hasil nahin kar paaya
 His tenure as the home minister of the state is remembered, as he gave the Mumbai Police and Maharashtra Police complete leeway to eliminate mafias and the police eliminated many mafias
 chhot paane ke baad kai saamaanya pulicekarmi bhi mumbai, thane, pune, nagpur or anya sthanon par encounter visheshgy ban gaye or unhone kai saare gundon ko maar giraaya
 After Mahajan's death in 2006, Munde became one of the most senior leaders in Maharashtra
 lekin 2009 main party adhyaksh kii kursi hasil kar gadakari ne unhen peeche chhod diya
 But after that Munde was made the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha
 kuch bhi ho munde-gadakari ke bich party raajnneeti main ek nishpaksh kaamkaaji rishta kaayam tha
 But on Tuesday morning, everyone was shocked by the news of Munde's tragic demise
 haal hi main sampann hue loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa netritv vaale rajg ko aitihaasik jeet hasil hui to munde or gadakari, donon ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv vaali centre sarkaar main mantri banaaya gaya
 Not only this, in the Lok Sabha elections, Munde's niece, Poonam mahajan-rao, daughter of Pramod Mahajan, also won from Mumbai
 unke bhai rahul mahajan televijan se jude hue hai
 Munde is the second mass leader from the backward Marathwada region of Maharashtra, who died untimely

 Can Suresh Prabhu be Manmohan Singh for Railways? Manmohan Singh is a single person This question does not arise for Finance Minister Arun Jaitley because his train has left the station
 alabatta 2016 rail mantri prabhu kaa saal ho saktaa he
 Budgets are always big, important and decisive, but not all budgets
 kuch hi bajaton ko 1991 jaisaa hone kaa mauka miltaa he jo ki kisi desh kii arthvyavastha kaa cheharaa-mohara koun kahe, puraa diene hi badal de
 Suresh Prabhu, according to time, opportunity and custom, stands exactly where Dr
 manmohan singh 1991 main khadey the
 And the railway is also in the same condition where the Indian economy was in ninety-one
 jaise 1991 main krantikari sudhaaron par aage badaae ke alaava koi rasta nahin tha thik usee tarah prabhu ke paas railway ko jaise kaa taisa banaae rakhane kaa vikalp bhi khatm ho gaya he
 Comparing the situation of today's railway with India's economic situation in 1991 can help us understand its crisis and opportunity for God
 1991 main bharat pratispardhaa rahit, vittiya sankat se bharpoor, sarkari ekadhikaar se ladaa-fada mulk tha jisamen nai takanic or tej raftaar badlaavon kaa pravesh varjit tha
 This conservative structure surrounded India with many economic vicious circles from the country to the foreign fronts
 railway aise hi dushchakr kaa shikaar he
 It is important to know some statistics
 maal haada or yatri parivahan railway kaa mukhya kaarobaar he
 With both growth in the economy and increasing income of people, both types of transport are increasing but the share of railways in the transport market has fallen from 56 per cent in 1990 to 30 per cent in 2012
 maal bhaade ke bazaar main railway kaa hissaa teen dashak main 62 se 36 fisadi or yatri kaarobaar main 28 se ghatakar 14 fisadi rah gaya
 According to a recent report by Axis Direct Research, Indian Railways spends 54 paise per km of passenger transportation and earns 26 paise revenue
 isaki tulana main china kii railway kaa rajasav 63 fisadi zyada he
 Railways have exempted themselves from the freight transport market by increasing freight to cover losses
 maal dhulaai or yatri parivahan kii maang ke baavjood railway pichley 20 saal main apana network naam ko bhi nahin badha pai
 Indian Railways is the slowest rail in the world with an average speed of 25 km of goods trains and 70 km for passenger trains
 isaki kul kamai kaa 91 fisadi hissaa vetan bhatton, karj par byaaj or puraane tareeke ke kaamkaaj par kharch ho jaataa he
 In the absence of modernization, its entire network has collapsed, where the number of accidents is the highest in the world
 darasal, agar railway koi company hoti to niveshak isse puri tarah kinaaraa kar chuke hote or ise biimaar ghoshit kar diya jaataa, isliye prabhu ke aane tak railway darasal karj hasil karne main bhi chukne lagi thi or philhal bhartiya jivan beemaa nigam se mili karj par chal rahi he
 Reforms in the Indian economy began in 1991 with extensive restructuring and some major projects that took about five years to be built
 is maamle main prabhu manmohan ke mukaable kismat ke dhani hai
 They have an agenda for reforms and also know what priority to do
 railway kii sabase badi taatkaalik jarurat iske network par bheed kam karnaa he
 If a railway minister is to prove to be truly a reformer, he should give up everything on one project leaving everything and that is the Dedicated Freight Corridor connecting Mumbai to Delhi (1,500 km) and Ludhiana to Kolkata (1,800 km)
 DFC), which will change the entire picture of goods transportation by railway
 donon coridor ke liye kramshah 90 or 75 fisadi bhoomi adhigrahan puraa ho chukaa he or japan va vishwa bank se madad milanaa bhi tay ho gaya
 The DFC may be a freight transport project, but its real benefit will be to the passenger transport of the railways
 diefasi banate hi malgadiyon kaa puraa network is coridor ke hawaale hoga, jisase railway ko apni yatri gadiyon ke liye patariyaan khaali karne, trainon kii gati badhaane or nai trainen chalaane main madad milegi
 The Dedicated Freight Corridor should have got priority in this government just as road projects got in the Vajpayee government
 diefasi ke liye sansadhano kaa jugad ho rahaa he lekin rail ke vartmaan network ko isse zyada sansaadhan chahie
 Railways is the world's largest transportation company, impossible to run on loan
 prabhu agar sach main saahsee hai to yah bajet railway ke punargathan kaa sabase makul mauka he
 Just as in 1991, Manmohan Singh freed the lump sum control and brought India into the category of modern countries, similarly Prabhu can start the journey of demolishing the old structure of the railway and making it a modern railway company
 ek aisi company jo sahi keemat par shandaar seva detii ho na ki skool or dawaakhaane chalaane se lekar pahiyaa or dhura sab kuch khud banaati ho
 Restructuring of the railway is the only way to save it, which will open the way for privatization of railway manufacturing and sale of railway assets
 isse railway ko sansaadhan milenge taaki vah apane network ko aadhunik bana sake
 If Railway Minister Prabhu wishes, he can go to another budget or can be truly revolutionary by increasing the fare, freight and announcing some symbolic features
 railway bharat kii sabase badi parivahan pranali he
 Intelligence and lack of resources is not as big a reason for the railway's plight as the confusion and skepticism of the political leadership
 2016 kaa rail bajet sujh-boojh par nahin, suresh prabhu ke saahas ke paimaane par ksaa jayega

 Yes, there are some jihadi elements in India, but there is no evidence of the presence of al-qaeda in the country

 jawahiri ne bhartiya upmahadweep main alqaida kii nai shakha kholane kii baat kahi thi
 Bergan said, 'zawahiri's effort is to have people like us discuss him because he has been away from discussions for a long time, all this is about ISIS in Iraq and Syria and Al Qaeda is very concerned that he is now The past has become the story of tomorrow

 The Home Minister said on the statement of Asaduddin Owaisi of AIMIM that we have no hatred for Muslims
 aap bhi nafrat paidaa karne kii koshish mat karnaa
 He made it clear that no Muslim in this country has anything to do with this bill
 unhone loksabhaa main naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak par hui charchaa kaa jawaab dete hue kaha ki yah vidheyak lakhon karodon sharnaarthiyon ko yatnapurna narak jaise jivan se mukti dilaane kaa saadhan banane ja rahaa he jo log bharat ke prati shraddha rakhte hue hamaare desh main aae, unhen naagarikta milegi
 Amit Shah said that NRC will come in the country and when NRC will come, not a single intruder will survive in the country
 unhone kaha ki kisi bhi rohingya ko kabhi sweekaar nahin kiya jaayegaa
 The bill provides for making people from Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who came to India due to religious persecution from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan eligible to apply for Indian citizenship

 On the idea of some members of the opposition failing the NRC, Shah said, "I want to assure again that when we bring the NRC, not a single intruder will survive in the country
" '' shah ne kaha ki hamaara rukh saaf he ki is desh main enarasi lagu hokar rahegaa

 During this time she danced on the rhythm of Aarti in the temple in such a way that everyone got into thinking
 radhe maa ne yaha jamkar dance kiya
 Significantly, Radhe Maa, who describes herself as an incarnation of Goddess Durga, has appeared on public swimming like this after a long time
 iske pehle vah kaaphi vivaad main rahi thim
 Radhe Maa is often hurt by her dress, strange and poor way to remove the sufferings of the people and by giving red roses to the devotees, 'I love you from the bottom of my hort', Radhe Maa dancing in this kind of temple

 Radhe Ma always carries a yellow trident in her hand

 Modi said that the Congress has done the Tughlaq Road scam, the house of the Congress leader had come full of notes from Madhya Pradesh

 But this watchman is alert, will not let him steal

 The Prime Minister said that today the congress-ncp are standing with those who want two Prime Ministers in the country

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special newzlator oneplus 7 Pro Review: About a month ago, in the month of May, oneplus launched its flagship smartphone oneplus 7 Pro
 saath hi main oneplus 7 kii bhi lonching kii gai thi
 Since the launch, we have used this smartphone as our primary phone and now we are going to share its long term review with you
 rivyuu ke dauraan kai apadats bhi mili hai or apadats ke saath hi ye smartphone pehle se behatar hota gaya he
 Its prices - for 6GB RAM + 128GB storage, 8GB RAM + 256GB storage and 12GB RAM + 256GB storage, have been kept at Rs 48,999, Rs 52,999 and Rs 57,999 respectively
 is keemat ke hisaab se samsung ke flagship S10e ko hi iske saath rakhaa ja saktaa he, jisaki keemat blike (6GB ram + 128GB storage) ke liye 47,500 rupee philhal amejon par he
 But in terms of specifications and features, oneplus 7 Pro is ahead of this Samsung phone
 isi tarah premium category main Apple lovers ke liye iphone XR kaa 64GB verient flipcart par 59,900 rupee main maujuud he
 While at a lower price, you are getting the top variant of 7 Pro and in terms of specifications, the flagship of oneplus is also ahead here
 khayr ye alag baat he ki aipal kaa apana echosystem he
 In this case, 7 Pro is a best option in the premium category
 to aaie jaanate hai ki kya ye smartphone aapako khareednaa chahie?dizin, bild-quality or disple:sabase pehle ise haath main lete hi jo cheez aapako mahasoos hogi wo ye he ki ye smartphone vajani he
 Its screen size is 6
 7-inch he
 That is, in addition to being weighed, it will also bother you to handle with one hand
 haalanki istemaal karte-karte aap iske aadi ho jaaegi
 i think the weight is more due to the large battery and metal construction
 baaki back panel kaaphi premium luk vaala he, jahaan glass kii phinishing di gai or texchar mat vaala he
 Fingerprints fall fast here, in such a case, you can use the case given with the box to avoid dropping
 baaki bottm main spikar, sim slot or USB tip c port diya gaya he or rhite said main power batan or alert slider he
 On the left side, there is a pop-up selfie camera in the power volume and top
 dhyaan rahe adishnal memory card ke liye yahaan slot nahin he or 3
 You will not find even a 5mm headphone jack
 overol bild-quality kaaphi shandaar he or premium luk miltaa he
 Talking about the front panel, there is no notch due to the pop-up selfie here
 sies hamane aapako upar hi bataa diya he
 The rest is not given wireless charging and IP certified rating
 disple kii baat karen to ye isaki sabase badi khaasiyat he
 6 here
 67-inch karvd QHD+(3120 x 1440 picksal) Fluid AMOLED disple diya gaya he or saath hi main yahaan 90hz rifresh rate diya gaya he
 Which makes it quite awesome with the Nokia Lace Display and Curved Edges
 gamers ke liye ye screen behtareen he
 With the updates, the company has also improved its Touch Experience
 ek baat dhyaan rahe jab aapako 90hz rifresh rate kii aadat lag jaaegi to baaki smartfones ke anemation aapako thode lag karte najar aaenge
 There is no problem in the rest of Colors, Brightness and Contrast too
 saath hi said vuing angel bhi behtareen he or jo baat ab tak keval samsung ke panel main hoti thi, vahiin magic bahut ab vanplus ne kar dikhaaya he
 However, there will be a difference of 19-20 compared to Samsung's panel
 isamen HDR10+ kaa bhi saport he or video ke liye video enhansar bhi diya gaya he or hai 516ppi aapke vijual experience ko behtareen banaata he
 Night mode is also provided for the rest of the blue light filters
 isamen in-disple fingerprint sensor he jo kaaphi fast he
 Software: This smartphone has Android 9 Pie based oxygenos (v9)
 5) kaa saport diya gaya he
 The interface of oneplus is likewise known for extremely clean interfaces
 yahaan bhi company ne vahi kahani doharaai he
 Talking about the special features, this time a screen recorder has been given here
 joki van tach acces ke saath diya gaya he
 Talking about other special features, it has a dedicated Fnatic mode for gaming
 jo baaki saare kaam band keval gaming ke liye phone ko taiyaar karata he
 Apart from this, there is a special Zen mode that gives you away from the virtual world for 20 minutes
 is dauraan aap keval phone main emergency kol or photo clic kar paaenge or ek baar actevet karne ke baad aap ise band bhi nahin kar sakate
 Also, Always On Display is not provided here
 haalanki ise apadet ke jariye die jane kii taiyaari he
 Apart from all this, i would also like to compliment the notification light
 jab bhi aapke phone main notification aayega, screen ke karvd agej main blue color kii lite flash hogi jo kaaphi shandaar lagati he
 The rest of the interface is clean and smooth and no specific blots will be visible
 acchhee baat ye he ki nae-nae apadet ke saath smartphone behatar hota ja rahaa he
 Performance: We have used this smartphone with 12GB of RAM and the flagship Snapdragon 855 processor
 hamen daily yuj main 1 maheene se bhi zyada yuj karne ke baad bhi koi takalif nahin ai he
 Whether it is to switch apps or open apps or to use multiple apps, this is totally best
 hair rifresh rate ujes or chaar chand laga detaa he
 You will not face any problem even in heavy games like PUBG Mobile and Asphalt 9
 keval 20-25 minute baad aapako halki hiting kii problem ho sakati he, lekin ise aap ignor kar sakate hai
 It also has Dolby Atmos for audio
 uski baat karen to aapako vaaki ek powerful sterio spikar milegaa
 However the earpiece speaker will have less sound and the down firing speakers will get better quality
 lekin overol sound balance hi lagegaa
 Also you can take advantage of this in headphones
 camera or bydaree:sabase pehle camere ke spacifications kii baat karte hai to yahaan rier main tripal camera seoup diya gaya he
 The primary camera in the rear of this smartphone is the 48-megapixel Sony IMX586 sensor (aperture f / 1
 6) he
 The same sensor is also found in smartphones like Redmi Note 7 Pro
 saath hi yahaan OIS or EIS kaa saport diya gaya he
 The second camera is an 8 megapixel sensor with a telephoto lens
 iskaa aparchar f / 2
 4
 yahaan keval OIS kaa saport milegaa
 The third camera is a 16-megapixel sensor with ultra-wide angle lens
 iskaa aparchar f / 2
 Is 2 yahaan dual LED flash, 3X optical juum, multi autofocus (PDAF, LAF, CAF) kaa bhi saport maujuud he
 Also, there are standard features like portrait, ultra-shot, nightmode, pro-mode, AI scene detection, panorama, HDR, studio lighting and RAW image file support
 ab sidhe primary camere kii baat karte hai to aapako bataa 48 megapixl image clic karne ke liye aapako JPEG or RAW main karnaa hoga
 In the rest of the auto mode, you will be able to click 12MP photos
 primary sensor se din ke ujaale main aapako best shots milenge
 At the same time, low-light performance will disturb you
 lekin iske liye aap nitscape mod kii madad le sakate hai
 But the problem here is that in this mode, you will be able to take the help of standard lenses, even you will not be able to zoom
 iske baad portret mod main din main aapako photose achche milenge, lekin iske liye subject kaa becoground thodi duuri par hona chahie
 We did not like the photos much in portrait mode
 sabase badi dikkat ye he ki potrate main shots aap keval juum camere se le paaenge
 In such a situation, if you want to take portrait shots by sitting in a small place, then you will get upset
 nitscape mod main kai apadats ke baad tasviren kamaal kii aati hai, jisaki jhalak aap yahaan dekh paaenge
 There is no problem in focusing here and the HDR shots are also amazing
 ek baat aapse or kah dena chaahunga ki din ke vakt bhi kai baar aapako primary sensor se colors aapako zyada dark milenge, joki natural nahin lagate
 After this, talk about the telephoto sensor, here the company claimed lossless, but the 3X full zoom does not get better quality in the pictures
 raat ke samay ye dikkat or bad jaati he
 Now talking about ultra wide angle lens, here i got the photos fine during the day
 aisa isliye kah rahaa hum kyonki samsung Galaxy S10 kii tarah zyada wide vyuu nahin miltaa or quality bhi itani acchhee nahin he
 At night, this problem increases
 isi tarah video shooting ke dauraan bhi aap wide angel lens kii madad nahin le pate hai
 This is a big problem
 video shooting kii baat karen to yahaan slo-moshan 1080p 240fps yaa 720p 480fps par kii ja sakati he
 There is 4K support for video recording but 5 minute recording at 60fps and 10 minute recording at 4K 30fps
 baaki 1080p main aap apni marji se recording kar sakate hai
 The stabilization here is amazing and there is no problem in focusing as well
 ant main front camere kii baat kare to ye camere behtareen he
 Here is a pop-up selfie camera
 ye 16 megapixl soni IMX471 sensor he
 Its aperture f / 2
 0 he or yahaan EIS kaa saport bhi maujuud he
 The response to HDR is also better here
 ab bydaree kii baat karen to is smartphone main varp charge 30 fast charging saport ke saath 4000mah kii bydaree di gai he
 You can also run it for 14 hours in heavy use, which is a figure with a 90hz refresh rate
 aise main ye behatar sthiti he
 In normal use, you can run it for more than 20 hours
 bydaree ko or behatar karne ke liye 60hz rifresh rate main bhi phone ko istemaal kar sakate hai
 The best thing is that you can charge it from 0% to 45% in just 30 minutes of charging, which is better for you
 camera sample:note- image web ke liye risise kii gayi hai
 Night Scape modmacro Shotwide Angle shotlo-lite 3X joomnitescapefacella: According to its price we can call it the best Android smartphone in the premium category
 kuch kamiyaan hai, wo ye he ki wireles charging nahin he, overol camera parformens utani acchhee nahin he or phone kaaphi vajani he, jisase ek haath se handle karne main pareshaani hoti he
 From the rest of the battery to the display and software to the hardware, this phone is the champion
 reating- 8
 5 / 10 'agenda ajtak' ke manch par 'kya ram mandir banegaa 2019 kaa mudda?' par jam kar netaaon kii bich bahes hui
 The event was attended by AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi, Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Sudhanshu Trivedi from BJP
 congress netaa abhishek manu singhvikaryakram main ram mandir, teen talaak or aarakshan ke mudde par teenon netaa ek-duusare kii party par aarope-pratyarope lagaate dikhe
 Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that BJP leader and Asaduddin Owaisi ji speak the same language
 donon desh ko todane vaala bayaan dete hai
 These two know how to shine their politics by talking about hindu-muslim only
 singhvi ne kaha ki ram mandir ko lekar ye donon keval raajnneeti kar rahe hai, inhen bhi pataa he ki maamla adaalat main he or adaalat kaa faisla jo aayega wo sabhi ke liye maanya hoga, lekin donon janata ko gumraah karne ke liye bayaan dete rahete hai, ek kehete hai ki ayodhya main ram mandir banegaa or doosraa kahata he ki vahaan masjid kaa nirmaan hoga
 Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that the Congress is a rainbow party, it takes everyone along
 mujhe bhagava rang pasand he or main aksar pahentaa hum
 This does not mean that i have become BJP
 singhvi kii maane samvidhan kisi dharm ko aadhaar maan kar aarakshan dene kii ijaajat nahin detaa, lekin yadi kisi dharm ke kisi varg ko aarthik aadhaar par kamjor paaya jaataa he to uske liye vishesh aarakshan kaa praavdhaan kiya ja saktaa he
 BJP leader Sudhanshu Trivedi, while BJP leader alleged that the views of Congress and AIMIM are the same
 donon saath milakar sarkaar bhi chalaa chuki he
 Sudhanshu Trivedi said that in the interest of both the countries, the sides of the terrorists are always seen together
 chaahe wo jakir nike ho yaa phir sansad par hamale kaa doshi afjal guru
 Both parties are worried about him but do not remember the jawan who died in 1948
 wo bhi muslim the lekin inhen to desh todane waalon kii zyada chintaa he
 Asaduddin Owaisi's reply to BJP- Congress Responding to the allegations of BJP and Congress, AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi got caught in Bollywood songs' Razia goons
 
 
 or umrao jaan kaa hawala diya
 He said that they do not have the same conditions as these two
 ovaisi kahana chaah rah the unki party naa to congress ke saath he or naa hi bijepi ke saath
 We keep the truth in front of the country, which these two parties do not digest
 ovaisi ne ajtak ke manch se kaha ki jati desh kii sachai he, ise asweekaara nahin ja saktaa
 While giving his opinion on the issue of Ram temple, Owaisi said that in 1955, there was no Ram temple in the bjp's agenda
 bijepi ko 1989 main ram yaad aae, kyonki unhen dilli najadik dikh rahi thi
 Since then, the party has been making it a politics issue
 ovaisi ne kaha ki purv piem narsimha raav bhi chaahate the ki ayodhy main ram mandir bane
 According to Owaisi, the Congress did not do anything for the Muslims before, only kept the vote bank, now the BJP is strengthening its vote bank by removing them
 unhone kaha ki ram mandir par court kaa faisla sabhi ko maanya hoga
 And everyone should wait for it

 bhale hi film abhinaytasanjay dutt1993 bam blast ke ek maamle ke sambandh menmili sajaa par maafee ke liye koi apil nahin karenge
 But Justice Markandey Katju has written a letter to President Pranab Mukherjee to pardon Sanjay Dutt
 saath hi unhone grahamantri or maharashtra ke rajyapal se bhi sanjay dutt ko maafee dene kii apil kii he
 On Thursday, Justice Markandey Katju has also advocated pardon to Jabunnisa Kazi after Sanjay Dutt
 unhone kaha tha ki wo iske liye raashtrapati or rajyapal ko chitthee likhenge
 Like 70-year-old Jaibunnisa Kazi, Sanjay Dutt has received a five-year sentence for possessing illegal weapons
 fark sirf itnaa he ki sanjay dutt ko jahaan arms act main sazaa mili he vahiin zabunnisa ko tada ke tahat
 Should Sanjay Dutt be pardoned? Justice (retd) Markandey Katju, President of Press Council of India, said on Thursday that he would appeal to the Supreme Court for a five-year sentence to Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt in connection with the 1993 bomb blasts 
 katju ne kaha ki vah maanavtaa ke aadhaar par unki sajaa maaf karne kii apil karenge
 At the same time, he will also appeal for waiving the sentence of Jabunnisa, who has been sentenced to only five years in this case
 sajaa maafee ke liye apil nahin karne ke sanjay ke faisle ke baad apni sthiti spasht karte hue katju ne kaha, 'sanjay apil nahin kar sakate hai, lekin main unhen maaf kiye jane kii apil karuunga
 i think he deserves it
 'katju ne aaj tak se kaha, 'sanjay ne kaha he ki vah maafee ke liye apil nahin karenge, lekin duusare log maafee ke liye apil kar sakate hai or main unke liye aisa karne ja rahaa hum
 i am preparing a letter to waive the sentence of both Sanjay and Jabunnisa
 'unhone kaha ki vah 53 varshiya sanjay ore70 varshiya jabunnisa ke liye maanavtaa ke aadhaar par sajaa maafee kii apil karne ja rahe hai
 Jabunnisa was a co-accused in the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts
 sarvocch nyaayalay ne unhen bhi paanch saal kaid kii sajaa sunai he
 Regarding the reason for appealing for the amnesty of Sanjay and Zaibunnisa, Katju said, 'sanjay has suffered for 20 years
 main unki sajaa maaf karne ke liye lagaataar prayaas karata rahoonga
 Personally i do not know them
 na to main unka prashansak hum or na hi filmein dekhtaa hum
 i am not their friend or relative
 lekin sanjay or jabunnisa, donon maanavtaa ke aadhaar par sajaa maafee ke hakdaar hai
 'katju said,' i did not talk to Sanjay Dutt
 maine unase sampark nahin kiya or unhone bhi mujhase sampark nahin kiya
 i issued my first appeal without contacting him
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘agar aap samvidhan ke anuchhed 72 or 161 kaa adhyayan karte hai to inamen yah nahin kaha he ki koun apil kaa saktaa he
 Article 72 empowers the President and Article 161 to forgive the Governor
 ’ucchtam nyaayalay ke purv nyaayadhish ne kaha, ‘parantu ye donon anuchhed iskaa ullekh nahin karte hai ki koun apil kar saktaa he
 It is also not written on which grounds forgiveness can be given

 patliputra seat kii ore sabaki nigahen tiki hui hai
 Everyone wants to know whether Lalu Prasad's daughter Misa Bharti wins from this seat or one of his 'uncles'
 pesh he pradesh kii siyaasi lahar kaa jayja leti 'bihar diary bifor ellection' kii 22veen kist
 
 
 According to the information that is being received, according to that, the Pataliputra seat can go to the Laloo family
 misa ko yadavon-musalamaanon ke adhikansh mat to mili hi hai, atyant pichhadi jatiyon main kaharon, dhanukon or daliton ke vot bhi mili hai
 One of the meanings is that the castes which had started voting for Nitish in recent years, have returned to Lalu again, considering Nitish's party dead in this election
 mul rup se ye kuch jatiyaan mandal parivaar kii kattar voter hai, jinhen bijepi kisi keemat par nahin chahie
 The number of such voters in Bihar is also significant
 duusari baat, lalu ne dhanuk or gangout jaisi manzali jatiyon ko bhi tikat diya he, uskaa rajyavyapee asar dikh rahaa he
 But the important thing is that this seat was the seat of Lalu's reputation
 lekin kya har seat par aisa ho paaegaa? vaise bhi lalu pichhali baar bahut kam vot se haare the
 This time the fight is triangular, so Ranjan Yadav is out of the ground anyway
 lalu ne badi hoshiyaari se ranvir sena vaale brahmeshwar mukhiya ke bete ko bhi khadaa karvaa diya tha
 In such a situation, if he cuts even 10-15 thousand votes, then Ramkripal will become a field
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki lalu ke jail jane se pichhadon main ek silent sahanubhuti bhi thi, jiskaa thodaa asar chunaav par padaa he
 It is certain that the hardline voter of the Mandal family in Bihar would like to let only one of Lalu and Nitish stay in the ground
 to kya nitish kii haar main lalu kii punarvaapasi chhipi he? ye kahana abhi jaldbaaji he, kyonki unheen pichhadon main ek tabaka aisa he, jo yadavon ko kisi keemat par satta main punarvaapasi karte nahin dekhnaa chahta
 But if the current trend continues and JDU continues to weaken in every seat, then only BJP alliance and RJD alliance will survive the battle
 duusari ore, yah bhi sach he ki agar lalu ke badhat kii baat bade paimaane par faili, to lalu virdohi sari jatiyaan bijepi ke ird-gird jamaa ho jaaengi, jisase jediu kii rahi-sahi ummid bhi khatm ho jaaegi
 At present, the Lalu coalition would have seen seats around 15

 All his strength was driven by black money, which the Prime Minister destroyed in one stroke
 ramdev ne pradhanmantri kii jaan ko aatankwaad mafia, political mafia or drug mafia se khatra bataaya
 When asked Ramdev to clear up about the political mafia, he said, 'these are the same people who deposited thousands of crores of notes
 modi ne unase vot pehle hi chin liye the, ab note bhi chin liye, isliye wo to ghabaraaenge hin
 'aramdev to attend a private function in Vadodara said at the airport that the honest Prime Minister has taken a historic decision by risking his life

 In the 2008 Malegaon blast case, the Bombay High Court granted bail to Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur on a personal bond of Rs 5 lakh
 vahiin karnal purohit kii jamaanat arji khaarij kar di he
 Prior to this, the NIA has given a clean chit to Sadhvi Pragya Thakur in its investigation, despite its trial court dismissing Sadhvi's bail
 enie kaa daawa he ki sadhvi pragna thakur ke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane laayak saboot nahin he
 The reason for this is the absence of MCOCA law on the case, while the trial court has not yet given any decision on the removal of MCOCA
 enie ke mutabik- jis lmlfreedom motor cycle kii vajah se sadhvi ko aaropee banaaya gaya he vah jarur sadhvi ke naam par thi, lekin dhamaake ke bahut pehle se faraar aaropee ram ji kaalsangra use istemaal kar rahaa tha
 Apart from this, the witnesses, who have given a statement to join the accused Sudhakar Dwivedi, the two absconding accused Ramji Kalsangra and Sandeep Dange, to plant the bomb and ask Colonel Prasad Purohit to get RD x from him, have retracted their old statement
 chunki maamle par macoka kaa nahin banataa isliye unka pehle vaala ikbaalia bayaan adaalat main saboot nahin mana jayega
 Though the case is still maintainable on MCOCA, the NIA has a different opinion about Colonel Prasad Purohit
 may 2016 main apni chargeshit main enie ne karnal prasad shrikant purohit ko dhamaakon kii sajeesh ke pramukh aropiyon main se ek bataaya he
 According to the NIA, the Colonel founded the Abhinav Bharat Organization in the year 2006
 sanghathan ke naam par bade paimaane par dhan ikattha kiya or uske jariye hathiyaar or barood kii vyavastha kii
 At a meeting in Faridabad on 25 and 26 January 2008, the Colonel proposed the constitution of a separate Hindu nation and the saffron flag
 us meeting main muslimon se badla lene par bhi charchaa hui thi
 After that, in April 2008, a secret meeting in Bhopal discussed the bomb blast in Malegaon
 ennesail kii report main aaropee sudhakar dvivedi ke laptop main record sajeesh kii meeting kii aawaaj karnal purohit, sudhakar dvivedi or ramesh upaadhyaay kii aawaaj hone kii pushti hui he
 The conversation between Colonel Purohit and Ramesh Upadhyay is also intercepted after the blast, in which the Colonel is asking Upadhyay to get a separate SIM card for the conversation and to be careful during the conversation, which reveals the guilt hidden in his mind is
 pragna thakur kii giraftaar ke baad karnal purohit ne aaropee samir kulkarni ko esemes kar bataaya tha ki pune main uske ghar par aties ai thi
 The Colonel immediately asked him to leave all the numbers by telephone and leave Bhopal
 karnal par dhamaake ke liye ardex ke intjaam or supplai kaa bhi aarope he
 The blast in Malegaon on 29 September 2008 killed 6 people and injured 101 people
 maharashtra aties ne apni jaanch main sadhvi pragna thakur sahit 11 logo ko giraftaar kiya tha
 The investigation was later given to the NIA
 enie ne apni jaanch ke baad 13 may 2016 ko duusari supplimentry chargeshit main maamle main macoka lagane kaa aadhaar nahin hone kii baat kah sadhvi pragna singh thakur sahit 6 logon ke khilaaf mukadmaa chalane laayak saboot nahin hone daawa kiya tha
 While 10 people, including Colonel Prasad Purohit, claimed to have evidence of prosecution under the conspiracy of murder, murder, attempt to murder, Arms Act, Explosive Act and UAPA
 yah alag baat he ki trial court enie kii raay se sahamat nahin dikhi, jiske baad sadhvi pragna thakur or karnal purohit ne bombai hai court main jamaanat arji di thi
 In the High Court also, the investigating agency NIA did not object to the application of Sadhvi, but has opposed the application of Colonel Purohit
 adaalat main sunwaayee ke dauraan sajeesh kii meeting kii vah sidi bhi tuuti pai gai, jisamen sadhvi ke hone kaa daawa kiya gaya tha

 The Modi government at the center has completed four years
 26 may 2014 ko modi sarkaar ne shapath lee thi, or is baar sarkaar ne agle chunaav ke liye nayaa naaraa bhi garh liya he
 Fair intentions right development, Modi government again in 2019
 lekin janata in chaar saal ke kaam kaaj par sarkaar ko kitne number detii he ? kya log sarkaar ke kaam kaaj se khush hai? kya wo phir isi sarkaar ko or bijepi ko vot dene ke liye taiyaar hai? kya narendra modi or rahul gandhi kii lokapriyata main koi antar aayaa he? inhen saare sawaalon ko lekar siesds or lokaneeti ne survey kiya he
 Whose government will be formed if elections are held today? In 2014, the NDA got 323 seats, and the UPA was reduced to 60
 lekin agar aaj chunaav hote hai to endie ko bahumat ke aankade se sirf 2 zyaada, yani 274 siten milane kaa anumaan he
 However, the government can return to the NDA as soon as it falls
 upie ko aaj kii taarikh main 164 siten milane kaa anumaan he – yani pichhali baar ke mukaable bada phayda or anya dalon ke khate main pichhali baar ke 153 ke mukaable, 105 siten aa sakati hai, jinamein se kai congress yaa upie ke saath ja sakate hai
 According to the Karnataka formula, the competition can be a thorn if the election agenda is only to keep BJP and Modi out of power
 vot pratishat main koun aage-koun pichhib zaraa vot pratishat par nazar daaliye
 If elections are to be held today, then how many votes can be shared
 bijepi ko 32% or uske sahyogiyon ko 5% vot mil sakate hai
 Congress can get 25% and its allies 6%
 congress ke liye khushi kii baat ye ho sakati he ki jis bispi ke saath uskaa dostana upi main achche sanket de chukaa he, us bispi ko 4% or uske sahyogiyon ko, jinamein samaajawaadee party bhi shaamil he, 6% vot mil sakate hai, yani 10% kaa izapha upie ke khate main hota dikh rahaa he
 People's choice is changing
 In 2017, the BJP and its allies, which 45 per cent people liked, are in decline
 janvari 2018 main ye pasand 40% tak ai or aaj yani may 2018 main ye graph 37% tak gira he
 The Congress and its allies have benefited directly from this
 may 2017 main jis congress ko 27% log pasand kar rahe the, wo janvari main 30% or aaj kii taarikh main bad kar 31% he
 Simultaneously, the graph of Congress's support BSP and its partner parties has also gone up by 10% today as against 6% in May 2017
 rajasthan main bhi kam hua bijepi kaa jadoosarve ke mutabik rajasthan main bijepi ko nuksaan hota dikh rahaa he
 bjp's vote share is declining, which will directly benefit the Congress
 congress ke vot share main sidhe 10 fisadi kaa ijapha hota dikh rahaa
 In Rajasthan, where the BJP secured 45% of the votes in 2013, the BJP is seen getting 39% of the votes in the 2018 assembly elections
 congress ne 2013 main 33 pratishat jabaki 2018 main 44 fisadi vot hasil karti najar aa rahi he
 Talking about others, their vote share was 22 percent in 2013, which has now come down to 17 percent
 pakistan ke purv fouj pramukh ashraf parvej kayaani ke teen din ke beijing daure ke pehle hi din kii ghatana he
 On the morning of October 28, 2013, three Uygurs from Jinjiang, a Muslim-majority area in China's western province, barged into a large car with iron rods and gasoline at Thien An Man Chowk
 beijing ke madhya main hue is pehle aatanki hamale main do paryatak maare gaye or 40 log ghayal ho gaye
 a 'religious slogan' flag was found from the car
 phir chaape main paanch uigur pakade gaye
 These separatists were reportedly associated with the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM)
 is sanghathan ko turkistan islamic party (tiypi) ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 It claims that its terrorist camps are running in neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan
 china is sanghathan ko jinjiyang main pichley teen saal main hue kai dhamaakon ke liye doshi maanata he, jisamen 200 se zyada logon kii jaan ja chuki he
 In a video released a few days after the Thien on Man Chowk blast, ETIM described it as its most audacious attack
 dhamaake ne kayaani ke daure ko asaamaanya bana diya
 Hours later, he was to meet Guo Shengkun, China's Minister of Public Security and head of the anti-terror campaign, at the State Security Headquarters in front of the Thane On Man Gate
 guo ke karyaalay se car ke jalte malbe kaa najaara bhi saaf dikhataa tha
 During Kayani's visit, this peculiar contradiction is reflected in her 'evergreen' relationship with China
 pichley dashak bhar jis rishte ko "himalay se bhi ooncha, samudr se bhi gaharaa or shahad se bhi meetha" bataaya gaya, vah jamini hakeekat se mail nahin khaataa
 Perhaps the best example of this contradiction is the long-standing hanging of the proposed china-pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which will connect Jinjiang province with Pakistan through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir
 yah pariyojna dashakon se lataki padi he kyonki china ke raashtrapati hu jintao ke samay asthirataa kii ashanka haaavee thi

 pakistan ko shahahaalanki beijing main ranneetik visheshgyon, kutanyikon or adhikariyon kii maane to pichley 12 maheene main china ke ravaie main shaayad baari badlaav aayaa he
 According to him, this change started as soon as Hu Jintao's successor Xi Jinping came into command
 shi ne march, 2013 main satta sanbhali thi
 During the past year, Xi made the policy of 'one locality, one road' the focal point of his diplomatic agenda
 iskaa matlab he ki ek silk road iconomic belt he, jo jinjiyang ko madhya asia se jodega or duusare, jahajrani silk road he, jo china ko dakshin purv asia or hind mahaasaagar se jodega
 An advisor to Xi explains, "the president's initial initiative was to call a 'neighborhood diplomat' conference
" isaki mukhya baat yah thi ki pehle ke netritv ne pashchim par kuch zyada hi focus kiya or pados kii parvaah nahin kii
 a major sign of a change in attitude is that China has finally decided to carry forward the work of the corridor passing through Pakistan
 is faisle kii ghoshnaa sabase pehle shi ne pakistan ke raashtrapati mamanun hossain ke pichley saal farvari main beijing daure ke dauraan kii
 Then in November, when Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif went to Beijing, the decision was again emphasized
 uske baad ke maheenon main is pariyojna ko aage badhaane kii jaldbaaji bhi dikhi
 India Today has come to know that China has sent a team of geologists and engineers in the last few weeks
 yah toli peshawar or aasapaas ke ilaakon main is pariyojna kii maujuuda vakt main praasangikta kii jaanch-parakh kar rahi he
 The results so far are said to be promising for China
 sipiisi pariyojna main aakhir kya kuch shaamil hoga? mahatvakankshi vichaar yah he ki durgam kshetra se ghire ashaant jinjiyang ilaake ko rajmargon, pipeline or railway line ke jariye madhya or pashchim asia se jodpha
 The plan is to develop infrastructure and power projects from Kashgar (a town on the old Silk Road, where China is building the Economic Development Zone) to Karakoram Highway as well as Peshawar and Gwadar via Pakistan Occupied Kashmir
 china arab sagar ke kinare guadar main bandargah banane main pehle hi madad kar chukaa he
 This would open a new path for China for oil and gas imports, which currently depend on the narrow Malaca Bay and the controversial South China Sea route
 janvari main beijing ne ek pipeline kaa udghaatan kiya, jo dakshin-pashchimi praant unnan ko myanmar main mande dweep se jodatii he
 China hopes that Gwadar will open up another option
 bharat par asarsipiisi yojana kaa bharat ke liye vyapak asar he
 Going forward on this plan, China has made it clear that its intention is to build a permanent base in Pakistan occupied Kashmir
 uskaa yah ravaiya kashmir par pichley do dashak ke ravaie se alag he
 However, the Chinese authorities insist that there has been no change in its attitude that the solution to the Kashmir issue is to 'remove India and Pakistan'
 lekin bhartiya adhikariyon ke mutabik, ravaie main badlaav kaa pehla sanket 2009 main dikhaa, jab china ne jammu-kashmir ke logon ko natthi vija dena shuru kiya
 It does not do so in the case of the people of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir
 jawaab main bharat ne raksha maamalon main aadan-pradaan ko multavee kar diya or sanket diya ki tibet or 'ek china' par uskaa ravaiya kashmir par china ke ravaie se judaa hua he
 Then, China stopped giving stapled visas about two years ago
 dilachasp tathy yah bhi he, jisaki ore nai kitaab da china-pakistan exis ke lekhak andrew small ishaara karte hai
 According to him, China is showing 'low sensitivity to economic projects in Kashmir'
 small ke mutabik, 2005 main bharat-america atomi qaraar is maamle main ek mahatvapurn badlaav he
 After that the Chinese view was not limited to bilateral relations
 lambii yojanachin kaa shuruaati kadam sipiisi ke tahat ek-ek karke buniyadi dhaanche or bijli pariyojnaon ko apane haath main lene kaa he
 China's leading expert on Pakistan, Han Hua of Peking University, says, "this is a 20-25 year long project
 koi raturaat hone vaali nahin he
 "according to Han there was a 'reluctance' over the plan over 'security issues' over the years
 ve kehete hai, "hamaara najariya yah he ki jinjiyang kii samasya ko sulajhane kaa buniyadi tarika aarthik vikaas hi he
 Due to its geographical location it is difficult to connect with East China
 isliye pashchim kii ore dekhnaa zyada aasaan he
 "however, there are many hurdles in the path of CPEC scheme apart from inaccessible area

 In 2010, due to landslides and floods, the road remained closed for over a year
 sipiisi ke tahat lambii avadhi main sahi, ise saal bhar kholane kii yojana par kaam hona he
 In recent negotiations, China and Pakistan considered building a parallel highway, which would relieve landslides by building tunnels in the Khunjrab Pass
 ye vichaar romani khyal sareekhe or behad kharchile hai
 According to Pakistan's estimates, it will cost more than $ 11 billion
 lekin, 2013 tak afghanistan, pakistan or madhya asia ke maamalon ke america ke prabharee rahe david sidney ke mutabik ise ek jatke main khaarij bhi nahin kiya ja saktaa
 He says, "I am clear that no economic significance can be traced to the kashgar-gwadar corridor
" lekin agar china suzav ke mutabik 45 arab dollar kharch karne ko taiyaar he to isse is ilaake main badlaav kii puri sambhaavna he
 "pakistani authorities have advised investment of $ 34 billion in power projects in addition to $ 11 billion

 aatank kaa pachadawaise, china kaa bada sirdard kharch nahin, balki suraksha kaa maamla he
 Last year there were frequent bombings in Jinjiang
 thyen aan man chowk kii ghatana se jaahir he ki aatank apane ilaake se baahar pair failaa rahaa he
 In March 2014, Uygar bombers attacked a railway station in Kunming, Yunnan, killing 29 people and injuring 140 people
 sidney ke mutabik, yah ghatana china ke nazariye main 'bade badlaav' kii vajah bani
 He says, "there is a rethink in talking to Pakistan afresh on the issue of terrorism in China
" china main bahes kaa bada mudda yah nahin he ki pakistan gambhir he yaa nahin, balki yah he ki vah china kii chintaaon par gaur karne ke kaabil he bhi yaa nahin
 "authorities fear that opening the Xinjiang area for investment could also increase its proximity to terrorist forces in the West

 Afghanistan has sent several notes related to ETIM terrorists to China, which are active in Pakistan
 china ke adhikariyon ne khud kaha he ki ve itiiem or iesai ke kuch logon ke bich samparkon se waakif hai
 "the question for China is, who invited ETIM to come there, make a hideout and get food, weapons and training?" For now, it seems that Beijing will not consider it necessary to answer this question yet

 This car stopped next to my car, causing a lot of curiosity
 sheesha neeche kar jor awaz main baat hone lagi
 What a car aap log kya karte hai isse
 a clean white colored tank was kept inside the car
 tank ke pani ko dur tak pahunchane ke liye honda kaa bada sa jenerator or lambii pipe lapet kar rakhi hui thi
 Someone neatly arranged it in the Maruti Echo
 car ke upar laal rang kii pattee par naa koi naam na number
 The same message was written all around
 kripaya apane ghar ke baahar pani pine kaa mataka rakhen
 thank you
 driver sahab se poochne laga ki ye sandesh lekar kyon gum rahe hai
 He told that our sir gets water filled in those mats
 dilli ke kai fliover yaa vyast bas stand ke paas unhone matake rakhwayen hai
 We come in twice a day to fill those drinking water
 pani ekadam saaf he
 The generator and pipe are so that one drop of water is not wasted
 har boond matake main daalaa jaataa he
 On hearing this, an entire story ran in the veins
 jaldi number dijie to
 What is your name? driver sahab sankoch karne lage lekin number de diya
 Sir, i am speaking Ravish, from NDTV India
 ji, maaf kijiyegaa main hindi nahin bol paata, agar aap angrezi bol saken to
 The person who picked up the phone was old with voice
 alagh sahab se maine kaha ki sar mujhe angreji nahin aati par main angrezi samaj saktaa hum
 Both of them started talking
 67 saal ke alagh sahab apana puraa naam bhi nahin bataa rahe the
 He was hesitant to tell about his work
 mujhe acha lagata he isliye karata hum lekin publicity ke liye nahin karata
 Even after stubbornness, he did not tell the full name, but took a promise from him that your story would change the thinking of some, so they just agreed
 alagh sahab peshey se ejeeniyar maaloom pade
 After coming from America, he built his shelter in Panchsheel Park of Delhi and started finding a way to make the poor drink water in front of others
 dilli shahar main aisi jagah or imaaraton kii talash karne lage jahaan matake rakhe ja sakate hai
 Alagh sahib also discovered water for this
 step bai step skool or ek padosi ne pani dene kaa vaada kar diya
 To get the clean water from there to the Matka site, i bought two Maruti Eco and made it with steel sheets so that there is no rust
 unka kahana he ki pani to saaf or surakshit hi hona chahie
 We met eight Alhag Sahib in the same place where we met eight litters under the Delhi flyover
 asiad road ke bas stand ke paas bhi matake rakhe hai
 In this way they put the pottery in 8-10 places
 bas inaki ek koshish hoti he ki koi in matakon kii zimmedaari le le taaki koi todphod na kare
 The rest of the work was done by Alagh Saheb
 aap pani pite jaaiye or inaki gaadi bharti jaaegi
 Along with the pot, Alagh saheb also thought of a water cooler
 laga ki ye surakshit or sthaayee tarika ho saktaa he
 They started installing water coolers of forty eighty and one hundred and fifty liters
 in par laagat 30 se 45 hazaar tak aati he
 Algh Saheb takes all these expenses himself
 is kaam main dikkat ye ai ki sab cooler ko ahaate ke bheetar lagaana chaahate the
 Like it had to be installed inside the Jain temple of Mehrauli Road because there was a question about the safety of the cooler outside
 koi nal kaat le jaae to koi chadar
 But Alagh saheb's concern was that the poor got away from the water
 ek samasya or thi ki log bade bade bartanon main pani bhar kar le jane lage isse pani jaldi khatm hone laga
 What was then, used his engineering experience and designed the water cooler in such a way that maximum lota could come under the tap
 jahaan nal se pani girtaa he vahaan pinjade jaisaa bana diya
 The thought was that the thirsty drink should go and not someone should fill their pot with these coolers
 is tarah se alagh sahab ne dilli main bees water cooler laga diye hai
 Laughs and said that both money and water are limited but i like to do this work
 tippaniyan You have seen a cooler where the lines of Khalil Gibran are also written with water
 aap zarur is photo ko bada kar kavita ko padhiyegaa
 The poem says that your children do not belong to you
 wo aapke zariye zarur is duniya main aaen hai lekin ve aapke hi nahin hai
 His soul, his thinking are not yours
 unki apni he
 Wow, Alagh saheb, if you recite such a poem while drinking water, then what better work can be done than this
 dilli ke panchasheel park main rahane vaale alagh sahab alag kism ke jalayoddha hai
 This sudden story created a lot of confidence in me that even if the system defeats but man does not lose
 wo system ko chhod apana system banane lagata he
 Starts serving people

 Thank you for this
 hamaari mulaakaat to nahin hui magar phone par jo baat hui wo kaaphi he
 So say loudly, Panchsheel Park Pani Baba Ki Jai
 sar, main raveesh bol rahaa hum, enditivi india se
 Yes, sorry i could not speak Hindi, if you could speak English
 phone uthaane vaale shaks kii umr awaz se laraz rahi thi
 i told Alagh sir that i do not know English but i can understand English
 bas donon main baat hone lagi
 The 67-year-old Alagh Saheb was not even revealing his full name
 apane kaam ke bare main bataane ko lekar sankoch se bhar gaye
 i like it so i do but not for publicity
 bahut zid kii tab bhi puraa naam nahin bataaya lekin unase vaada le liya ki aapaki kahani na jane kitnon kii soch badal degi, to bas ve maan gaye
 Alagh Saheb appeared to be an engineer by profession
 america se aakar dilli ke panchasheel park main apana baseraa banaaya or dusron ke basere ke aage garibon ko pani pilane kaa rasta khojane lage
 In the city of Delhi, started searching for places and buildings where pottery can be kept
 alagh sahab ne iske liye pani kii bhi khoj kii
 Step by step school and a neighbor promised water
 vahaan se saaf pani ko mataka sthal tak pahunchane ke liye do maaruti iko khridi or use steel kii chaadaron se banaaya taaki jang na lage
 They say that water must be clean and safe
 alagh sahab kii gaadi se hamaari mulaakaat jahaan hui thi usee chiraag dilli fliover ke neeche aath matake rakhe hai
 There are also pots near the bus stand of Asiad Road
 is tarah se unhone 8-10 jagahon par matake rakh diye
 Their only effort is to have someone take responsibility for these mats so that no one can sabotage them
 baaki kaa kaam alagh sahab kaa
 You keep drinking water and their car will be filled
 matake saath alagh sahab ko water cooler kaa bhi khyaal aayaa
 Thought it could be a safe and permanent method
 unhone chalis assi or dedh sau litre ke water cooler lagane shuru kar diye
 The cost on these comes from 30 to 45 thousand
 ye sara karcha alagh sahab khud uthaate hai
 The problem was that everyone wanted to put the cooler inside the yard
 jaise mahrauli road ke jain mandir ke bheetar lagaana padaa kyonki baahar cooler kii suraksha ko lekar sawaal paidaa hone laga
 If a tap is cut, then a sheet
 magar alagh sahab kii chintaa ye thi ki garib to pani se dur ho gaya
 Another problem was that people started carrying water in big pots, due to which the water started running out quickly
 phir kya tha, apni ejineering ke anubhav kaa istamaal kiya or water cooler kii dizine is tarah se taiyaar kii zyaada se zyaada lotaa hi nal ke neeche aa saktaa tha

 The story at the crossroads while returning home from Ira Singhal, who topped the IAS exam even after the physical challenges, gave the opportunity to see the world from the loot and falsehood of political parties
 iske liye alagh sahab kaa shukriya
 We did not meet, but what happened on the phone is enough
 to jor se boliye panchasheel park vaale pani baba kii jai
 Alagh Saheb appeared to be an engineer by profession
 america se aakar dilli ke panchasheel park main apana baseraa banaaya or dusron ke basere ke aage garibon ko pani pilane kaa rasta khojane lage
 In the city of Delhi, started searching for places and buildings where pottery can be kept
 alagh sahab ne iske liye pani kii bhi khoj kii
 Step by step school and a neighbor promised water
 vahaan se saaf pani ko mataka sthal tak pahunchane ke liye do maaruti iko khridi or use steel kii chaadaron se banaaya taaki jang na lage
 They say that water must be clean and safe
 alagh sahab kii gaadi se hamaari mulaakaat jahaan hui thi usee chiraag dilli fliover ke neeche aath matake rakhe hai
 There are also pots near the bus stand of Asiad Road
 is tarah se unhone 8-10 jagahon par matake rakh diye
 Their only effort is to have someone take responsibility for these mats so that no one can sabotage them
 baaki kaa kaam alagh sahab kaa
 You keep drinking water and their car will be filled
 matake saath alagh sahab ko water cooler kaa bhi khyaal aayaa
 Thought it could be a safe and permanent method
 unhone chalis assi or dedh sau litre ke water cooler lagane shuru kar diye
 The cost on these comes from 30 to 45 thousand
 ye sara karcha alagh sahab khud uthaate hai
 The problem was that everyone wanted to put the cooler inside the yard
 jaise mahrauli road ke jain mandir ke bheetar lagaana padaa kyonki baahar cooler kii suraksha ko lekar sawaal paidaa hone laga
 If a tap is cut, then a sheet
 magar alagh sahab kii chintaa ye thi ki garib to pani se dur ho gaya
 Another problem was that people started carrying water in big pots, due to which the water started running out quickly
 phir kya tha, apni ejineering ke anubhav kaa istamaal kiya or water cooler kii dizine is tarah se taiyaar kii zyaada se zyaada lotaa hi nal ke neeche aa saktaa tha
 Where the water falls from the tap, made it like a cage
 soch yah thi ki pyaasa pani pikar jaae na ki koi in culeron se apana gadaa bhar le jaae
 In this way, Alagh Saheb has installed twenty water coolers in Delhi
 hansate hansate kaha ki paisa or pani donon simit he lekin mujhe yah kaam karnaa acha lagata he
 The comments aapane aisa cooler dekha he jahaan pani ke saath khalil jibran kii panktiyaan bhi likhi ho

 The story at the crossroads while returning home from Ira Singhal, who topped the IAS exam even after the physical challenges, gave the opportunity to see the world from the loot and falsehood of political parties
 iske liye alagh sahab kaa shukriya
 We did not meet, but what happened on the phone is enough
 to jor se boliye panchasheel park vaale pani baba kii jai
 We met eight Alhag Sahib in the same place where we met eight litters under the Delhi flyover
 asiad road ke bas stand ke paas bhi matake rakhe hai
 In this way they put the pottery in 8-10 places
 bas inaki ek koshish hoti he ki koi in matakon kii zimmedaari le le taaki koi todphod na kare
 The rest of the work was done by Alagh Saheb
 aap pani pite jaaiye or inaki gaadi bharti jaaegi
 Along with the pot, Alagh saheb also thought of a water cooler
 laga ki ye surakshit or sthaayee tarika ho saktaa he
 They started installing water coolers of forty eighty and one hundred and fifty liters
 in par laagat 30 se 45 hazaar tak aati he
 Algh Saheb takes all these expenses himself
 is kaam main dikkat ye ai ki sab cooler ko ahaate ke bheetar lagaana chaahate the
 Like it had to be installed inside the Jain temple of Mehrauli Road because there was a question about the safety of the cooler outside
 koi nal kaat le jaae to koi chadar
 But Alagh saheb's concern was that the poor got away from the water
 ek samasya or thi ki log bade bade bartanon main pani bhar kar le jane lage isse pani jaldi khatm hone laga
 What was then, used his engineering experience and designed the water cooler in such a way that maximum lota could come under the tap
 jahaan nal se pani girtaa he vahaan pinjade jaisaa bana diya
 The thought was that the thirsty drink should go and not someone should fill their pot with these coolers
 is tarah se alagh sahab ne dilli main bees water cooler laga diye hai
 Laughs and said that both money and water are limited but i like to do this work
 tippaniyan You have seen a cooler where the lines of Khalil Gibran are also written with water
 aap zarur is photo ko bada kar kavita ko padhiyegaa
 The poem says that your children do not belong to you
 wo aapke zariye zarur is duniya main aaen hai lekin ve aapke hi nahin hai
 His soul, his thinking are not yours
 unki apni he
 Wow, Alagh saheb, if you recite such a poem while drinking water, then what better work can be done than this
 dilli ke panchasheel park main rahane vaale alagh sahab alag kism ke jalayoddha hai
 This sudden story created a lot of confidence in me that even if the system defeats but man does not lose
 wo system ko chhod apana system banane lagata he

 Terrorist organizations like ISIS, al-qaeda, Lashkar and Jaish have conspired to terrorize many parts of the country on Republic Day
 aaazaad hindustan ke itihaas main jamhuriyat ke jashn (ganatantr diwas) kii suraksha kaa ab tak kaa sabase bada oparation shuru ho chukaa he
 The operation is safe from the border to the city
 ganatantr diwas kaa jashn rajpath paramanaaya janaa he
 But the whole country is living on high alert right now
 pichley chaar dinon main hi aatank ke napak gathjod ke 18 sandigdh aatankwaadi desh ke alag-alag hisson se giraftaar kiye ja chuke hai
 The count is not over yet
 rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal khud is oparation kii nigaraanee kar rahe hai
 Under the leadership of NIAA, police of all the states including Delhi are united day and night in the hold of terrorists

 Keep that line was seven urns
 iske baad jaise hi is code ko dicode kiya gaya puri sajeesh beparda ho gai
 'seven Kalash Rak Do' was a line that raised the ears of Indian security agencies
 isi ek line ko pakad kar jab jaanch aage badi to phir aantak kii sajeesh kii wo paraten khuleen jisane puure desh ko chaunkaa diya
 After this the series of arrests started, which continues even after 18

 Under this, Facebook accounts and telephones running in the support of ISIS in West Asian countries were being intercepted
 is kaam main hindustani agenciyaan bhi siie kii madad kar rahi thim
 During the surveillance, the CIA tracked hundreds of IS addresses in many countries, including Syria, Iraq and India
 in ypi adresses se fasebuk or duusare tuls kaa bhi istemaal ho rahaa tha
 One of these was also used by IS Commander Safi Armar alias Yusuf al-hindi
 armaar or uttarakhand main rahane vaale akhlaaq naam ke ek shaks ke bich fasebuk par hui ek baatcheet ko intercept kiya gaya
 It was written, 'keep seven urns
 ' siie ne saat kalash ke code ko dicode karne ke liye bhartiya khufia agenciyon se sampark kiya or unhen is baatcheet kii jaankaree di
 As soon as the information was received, NIA raided Haridwar and Roorkee and arrested four people including Akhlaq from there
 inaki giraftaar ke baad hi pehali baar khulaasa hua ki saat kalash rakh do kaa matlab saat jagah bam rakhana tha
 As news of the arrest spread, the rest of his fellow terrorists immediately started shifting
 lekin akhlaaq or uske saathiyon kii nishandehi par chhapemari kaa silsilaa jari rahaa
 These raids were killed in places like Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Lucknow and Tumkur
 injagahon se 14 or aatankwaadiyon ko giraftarkar liya gaya
 a total of 18 suspected terrorists have been arrested so far
 chhapemari kaa silsilaa ab bhi jari he
 According to security agencies, till now it has been revealed that they wanted to carry out terrorist attacks like Paris across the country
 is baar ganatantr diwas ke khaas mehmaan france ke raashtrapati he
 Seeing all-round danger, Delhi has almost been converted into a cantonment
 jameen se lekar aasmaan tak dilli kii nigaraanee kii ja rahi he
 This event of Republic Day is as special for the country as it is the biggest challenge for all the security agencies to properly celebrate this festival of happiness by thwarting the terrorist attack
