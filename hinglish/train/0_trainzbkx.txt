 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has returned the standard deduction for salaries
 vetanbhogiyon ko unki salanaa inakam par 40 hajaar rupee takstandard didactionamilegaa
 At first glance you may be happy to hear this, but the government has also snatched a lot from you to bring it
 iske alaava ses main 1 fisadi kii badhotaree ne bhi is raahat ko naakaafi sabit kar diya he
 What did the Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley give to the salaried people for standard deduction
 aapaki salanaa inakam par yah 40 hajaar rupee tak milegaa
 How much standard deduction you will get will depend on the scope of the tax slab
 bajet ne kya chheenabajet ne standard didakshanki suvidha to aapako di he, lekin usne aap se pehle mil rahe medical alouns va transport alouns ko waapas le liya he

 It has been withdrawn from you
 milegaa sirf 10 hajaar kaa phaaydabajet bhashanmein vitt mantri ne kaha ki maujuuda samay main vetanbhogiyon ko 30 hajaar rupee kaa phayda in alouns se miltaa he
 This means that you will only get a tax benefit of 10 thousand rupees
 lekin ses ko mat bhuuliestandard didction ke boote aapako 10 hajaar rupee kirahat bhale hi bataija rahi ho, lekin ses main jo badhotaree hui he, use mat bhuuliega

 For them, relief in the form of standard deduction is negligible
 standard didction kaa kya hoga phaaydastandard didction ko laane kaa phayda yah hoga ki aapkaa paperwork kam hoga
 After this you will not have to face the hassle of depositing bills to get medical reimbursement

 ve jajon kii bolti band kar sakati hai, mushkil main fanse oonche ohadedaaron or taqatvar logon ko aasmaan chooti fees lekar sankat se ubaar sakati hai
 In the meantime, they are next door to wealthy Indians like myself sitting in the luxurious mansions of Mayfair, brunch at Ladurée in Harrods or take drinks at The Garrick, or buy a tie at Drakes on Seville Raw or buy shoes from Fratelli on New Bond Street i spend time sijei ne unke jaise logon ke bare main bhala kuch sochaa he?nahin
 Instead of softening its stand, the CJI has asked the Chairman of the Bar Council of India to seek the views of the Bar Council of other states
 unhone sabhi hycourt ke mukhya nyaayadhishon ko patr likhakar unki raay maangi he
 The CJI has also put its blueprint of change in front of the public
 media ke saath baatcheet ke dauraan unhone bataaya ki agar saare jaj ek saath chuttee lene kii bajaae saal main alag-alag samay par avkaash len to adaalatein 365 din khuli rah sakati he
 "at the beginning of the year, the judges will have to inform the desk of the court hearing to determine when they want to take a break," he said
 ” uske hisaab se supreme court or hycourt kii peethon ke liye calendar bana liya jayega, jisase nyaaypalika bina kisi baadha ke kaam karti rahegi, ''aisa karnaa sambhav he or mujhe ummid he ki yah tarika kargar hoga
 "but the question is why are CJI playing spoiled? "probably because he will interfere on behalf of the common man by wearing a judicial chola," says Kolkata-based lawyer Ahin Chaudhary
 ” may or june main adaalaton main chuttee kaa elaan hote hi jaj or vakil ek saath maukey kaa phayda uthaane main jute jate hai
 Some people relax, gather new strength and think, some go abroad to visit, and some prepare for cases
 unhone bataaya ki 'jaruri’ mukademon kii sunwaayee ke liye ek avkashpith hone se nyaay dene kaa kaam bahut sust ho jaataa he
 Chaudhary says, "life comes to a standstill for the common man
 use kanoonee raahat paane ke liye kai hafte intjaar karnaa padataa he
 Delayed justice means being denied justice
 bahut kam jaj unki tarah khulkar bolte hai
 "the CJI in May 2013 exposed the government's interference in the functioning of the CBI with its sharp comment," CBI is like a parrot in a cage
 ”ve bharat main bakaayaa mukademon kii lambii fehrist ko chota karne ko betaab hai
 More than 30 lakhs in 21 High Courts, 2 in subordinate courts
 63 karod or supreme court main 39,780 mukademe vichaaradhin hai
 2 in various jails of the country
 5 lakh vichaaradhin kaidi hai
 It is worth noting the average number of litigations a judge handles in a day
 justise rabindra bhatta samiti kii 2013 kii report ke mutabik, deshbhar main kareeb 19,000 jaj hai or is hisaab se ek divaani mukadmaa khatm hone main kareeb 15 saal lagate hai
 According to the National Court Management System (NCMS) launched in 2013, the number of judges or courts has increased six-fold in the past three decades, but the number of lawsuits has increased 12-fold
 sakshartaa or prati vyakti aamadani badaae ke saath prati 1,000 aabaadi par daayar nae mukademon kii sankhya agle teen dashak main kareeb 75 ho jaaegi jabaki vartmaan dar prati 1,000 aabaadi par 15 mukademe hai
 In contrast, in China, with the help of modern methods and technology, prosecutions are settled within three months and the number of judges is 1

" adalati kaamkaaj main 50 fisadi deree saman taamil na hone, saman kii vaidhata, sahi pahchaan or aisi maamuli baton par bahes kii vajah se hoti he
 He says, "even in the famous litigation like 2G spectrum allocation, documents were taken from the accused to the court and from the court to the accused
 ” adaalaton main mukademon kii bheed kii vajah chhuttiyaan nahin, kaamkaaj kaa purana dharra he
 But the famous lawyer Ram Jethmalani argues, "the judges also need rest
 ” bharat main supreme court saal main 193 din, hycourt 210 din or nichali adaalatein 245 din kaam karti he
 In the US, like France, courts are never closed during summer vacation
 canada kii supreme court main sirf 11 din kii chuttee hoti he jabaki britain main adaalat saal main 24 din band rahati he
 Jethmalani says, "but the pressure of work is too much on the judges of our high courts
 do se teen jajon kii peeth har din 50 se 70 mukademe sunati he
 Every evening, they have to read thick files and write decisions for the next day
 yah kaam khuli adaalaton main nahin ho saktaa
 "jethmalani says that more than short leave in India, the need is to recruit a large number of judges and fill all vacant posts in the states
" adaalaton main sabase zyada lambit mukademe uttar pradesh main hai or vahaan jajon ke pad bhi sabase zyada sankhya main khaali hai
 The largest Allahabad High Court has a maximum of 10 lakh cases under consideration
 phir bhi vahaan sirf 90 jaj hai or 70 pad khaali hai
 Of the 906 sanctioned posts of judges in 21 high courts of the country, 300 are vacant
 jila or adhinsth nyaayalayon main 3,300 se adhik pad khaali hai
 He says, "the Supreme Court has set a target of raising the total number of judges to 30,000 in the next five years
 jajon ko 365 din adaalat main baitaane kii bajaae yah kahin zyada tarkpurna or uchit soch he
 "the question is whether all the courts should stay awake 365 days or should the judges or lawyers be allowed to live on their own in the long summer holidays? It is clear that the Chief Justice of India has put a finger on the sore side of the way the legal system works
 lekin iskaa arth nyaayik tantra kii baarikiyon par gaur karnaa bhi he:behad jatil or uljhe hue mukademon or daleelon main lambii garm dopaharon ko kharch karnaa

 In July 2013, Manchanda questioned the Delhi High Court through a PIL on why the court holidays still continue, "now we have air-conditioned and modern technology that has made it easier to work in unbearable heat?" At this the court bench retorted, "why are you behind our holidays?" a well-known judge once said that to do justice is "good luck, happiness and duty

 The Yogi government of Uttar Pradesh has issued an order to include 17 extremely backward castes in the Scheduled Castes
 in 17 jatiyon main kahaar, kashyap, kevat, mallaah, nishad, kumhaar, prajapati, dhivar, bind, bhar, rajbhar, dhimar, vatham, turaha, godiya, maanjhi or machuaaraa shaamil hai
 Which has more than 13 percent of the population in UP
 raajnneetik rup se 13 fisadi vot bank kaaphi mahatvapurn mana jaataa he
 This is the reason that before the BJP, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav had also made these bets, but at that time these communities could not get the Scheduled Caste status
 aise main ab dekhnaa hoga ki soobe kii yogi sarkaar apane is mansoobey main kaamyaab hoti he yaa nahin?bataa den ki uttar pradesh main lambey samay se ye pichhadi jatiyaan anusuchit jati main shaamil karne kii maang kar rahi hai
 Among them Rajbhar 1
 32 fisadi, kumhaar va prajapit 1
 84 percent and Gond 0
 22 fisadi hai
 Apart from this, the remaining 13 castes belong to the Nishad community
 jinamein nishad, bind, mallaah, kevat, kashyap, bhar, dhivar, batham, machuaaraa, kahaar, dhimar, maanjhi or turaha shaamil hai
 The population of these communities is about 10 percent
 is tarah se yogi sarkaar ne jin 17 jatiyon ko anusuchit jati main shaamil karne ke liye sifarish kii he
 Their total population is 13
 38 fisadi ho rahi he
 In such a situation, these castes can play an important role in the defeat in the upcoming assembly elections
 mulaayam singh yadav ne sabase pehle 2005 main in 17 pichhadi jatiyon ko anusuchit jati main shaamil karne ke liye ek aadesh jari kiya tha
 Mulayam's decision was stayed by the High Court, after which this proposal was sent to the Central Government
 centre sarkaar se manjuuri milti isse pehle uttar pradesh main sarkaar badal gai or mayawati 2007 main mukhyamantri bani to is prastaav ko khaarij kar diya
 After this, the intention of joining the Scheduled Castes of these castes was again destroyed
 haalanki baad main mayawati in jatiyon ko saadhane ke liye anusuchit jati main shaamil karne kii unki maang ko lekar tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko patr likhaa tha, lekin centre sarkaar ne is par koi tavajjo nahin di
 On the lines of Mulayam Singh Yadav, Akhilesh Yadav made a similar attempt just before the assembly elections
 disambar 2016 ko akhilesh ne 17 ati pichhadi jatiyon ko essi main shaamil karne ke prastaav ko cabinet se manjuuri di thi
 Notifications were issued by sending notifications to the Center, but this decision was challenged in the High Court, after which the matter got stuck in the Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
 ab bijepi ne in ati pichde samudaay ko saadhane kii kavayad kii he
 The Yogi government has recommended the inclusion of these 17 backward castes in the Scheduled Castes and is betting on joining a large vote bank
 abhi centre or rajya donon jagah bijepi kii sarkaar he
 Please tell that 20 in Uttar Pradesh
 7 fisadi dalit aabaadi he, jatav, valmiki, dhobi, kori, paasi, chamaar, dhanuk samet 66 upjatiyaan hai, jo saamaajik taur par banty hui hai
 They are getting 21 percent reservation in Uttar Pradesh
 aise main 17 ati pichhadi jatiyaan bhi shaamil hoti hai to dalit samudaay kii upjatiyon kii sankhya 83 pahunch jaaegi
 At the same time, in Uttar Pradesh, the OBC community is getting 27 percent reservation, including 79 castes in OBC
 uttar pradesh main obisi samudaay kii aabaadi kareeb 52 fisadi he, jinamein muslim obisi bhi shaamil hai
 In this way, if the recommendation by the Yogi government is approved, then 17 backward castes are separated, then 62 sub-castes will survive
 aise main obisi ke 27 fisadi aarakshan main jahaan jatiyaan kam hongi to anusuchit jati ke aarakshan main jatiyaan badhengi
 In fact, under the constitutional process, commissions were formed to identify castes, whose members roamed across the country to identify scheduled and backward castes
 iske baad bhi unhen category main baanta gaya tha
 Dalit thinker Professor Vivek Kumar says that the criteria that were set to identify Scheduled Castes
 uske mutabik ve jati jise achhut mana jaataa he yani jinke chune se log dooshit ho jate hai
 They can only be included in the Scheduled Castes
 aise main anusuchit jatiyon main ve jatiyaan shaamil nahin kii ja saktin, jo achhut nahin hai
 He says that the 17 castes that have been said to be included in the Scheduled Castes, are they victims of untouchability, if not, then it is completely unconstitutional to include them in the Scheduled Castes

 Microsoft is now preparing to stop supporting Windows 7
 iskaa saport bhi thik vaise hi band kiya jayega jaisaa Windows XP or Vista kaa kiya gaya tha
 In June last year, Microsoft discontinued official forum support for Windows 7
 is forum par log apni samasya lekar jate the or exparts iskaa samaadhaan bataate the
 Microsoft will not provide support for Windows 7 from January 14, 2020, exactly one year from now
 yani aapako apadats nahin milenge
 These updates also include security fixes and patches that protect the computer
 haalanki paise dene par aapako saport milegaa
 Significantly, Microsoft introduced Windows 7 on July 7, 2009
 7 ke baad Windows 8 aayaa phir Windows 8
 1 arrived and in July 2015 the company brought Windows 10
 ab company Windows 7 Extended Security Updates bechegi or iske liye har saal aapako paise dene honge
 This will be because enterprise users have been using this operating system for a long time and it will not be easy for them to remove it even further

 In the case of a mask, both were inherent — there was a duplicity in going in front of the public and then there was a possibility that the real face under the mask could be brought out whenever needed
 lekin yah hashia samooh kabhi apane centre ke bare main koi mahatvapurn baat nahin bataa saktaa
 In such a situation, the media also avoids both things — neither does it have to investigate how the power of any margin can spread violence on a wide scale in seven states — all bjp-ruled — for four days without any restraint and Nor did he feel the slightest need to criticize the fact that leaders like BJP / Sangh leaders, government officials and even the Censor Board were trying to fuel violence
 Or played the role
 na hi isse pehle kii ghatnaon (musalamaanon or daliton ko saarvajanik rup se maaraa janaa) or baad kii hinsak ghatnaon (kasganj kaa sampradayik danga) ke bich kisi tarah ke sambandh kii chaanbin kii jaati he
 Why did the BJP / Sangh allow such a laughable relationship to become so funny? The upcoming assembly elections in Rajasthan are a part of this strategy and then the politics of caste mobilization and polarization has always been giving big benefits
 updravikarni senaco apane se alag bataate rahanaa bhaajapa / sangh ke liye isliye bhi phydemand he kyonki isse logon ko yah sochate rahane dene main madad milti he ki centre kii takatein 'haashiye' kii nahin hai, bhale hi hakeekat main padmavat ko dikhaae jane ke khilaaf karani sena ke updrav or chaar rajya sarkaron ke film par turant pabandi laga dene ke kadam main vaaki koi antar nahin he
 Then, the presence of such marginal forces helps the BJP / Sangh to occupy both places simultaneously
 chaahe yah jagah shashan kii ho yaa phir virodh kii
 The Hindutva concerns are created by forging their own opposition and the government has to respond to it
 is tarah ke virodhon ko niyantrit kar apni manmarjee se shuru or band karke bhaajapa yah jaahir kar detii he ki vah shashan karnaa jaanati he
 And then, this hullabaloo, fire, smoke and bloodshed, etc
 can always be used to intimidate any legitimate public protest and solidarity on issues like economy, agrarian crisis and caste conflicts
 hakeekat yahi he ki haashiye kii in takaton ke bina bhaajapa / sangh kii centre kii takatein khud ko praasangik banaae nahin rakh saktin

 saboot dene kii jarurat nahiitna hi nahin bharat sarkaar ke paas is sargical strike ke kaaphi saboot hai, lekin inhen saarvajanik karne kaa koi iraadaa nahin he
 The government believes that the surgical strike was done to protect its territory, which is the authority of the government
 saboot dekar bharat kisi bhi prakaar bhi galat dharna nahin bananaa chahta
 There may be pressure on the Pakistani army to retaliate if the evidence is made public, which is not in the interest of India
 sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki yahaan tak america ne bhi osama ko maarane kaa koi saboot nahin diya tha
 According to government sources, no country, including the US and Russia, was informed of the surgical strike until it was completed

 isliye kisi bhi saboot ko saarvajanik karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Not only this, the effect of the operation was that earlier the launch pads were around 1-2 km from the line of control
 ve ham par kareeb se najar rakh sakate the, or kam samay main hamalaa bhi kar sakate the

 On Thursday, after the Supreme Court ordered all cases of Vyapam scam to be handed over to the CBI, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan said in a press conference that the investigation of Vyapam scam was an ordeal for me
 shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha ki congress ne mere upar kai aarope lagaae, lekin estf kii team ne eemaandaaree se is ghotaale par jaanch kii
 After some standing, the opposition party Congress turned it into charges
 unhone kaha ki is jaanch kaa puraa faisla meraa tha, isliye is baat ko maananaa chahie ki madhya pradesh sarkaar ne acha kaam kiya he
 The Congress tried to make Madhya Pradesh a bloody state
 siem ne kaha ki madhya pradesh sarkaar dwaara sibiai jaanch karne kii maang par supreme court ne rajya sarkaar kii tarif kii he
 The CBI probe was very important in the Vyapam scam, as many questions were being raised against us
 tippaniyan Now i request the CBI to start investigating this scam as soon as possible
 congress hameshaa meri istife kii maang karte rahi kyonki wo shivaraj ke bhay se grast hai
 If the Congress has any personal enmity with me, then they should take it out on me rather that they will discredit Madhya Pradesh
 vahiin, unhone madhya pradesh ke rajyapal ke pad ke bare main kuch bhi kehane se saaf manaa kar diya
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan said that the Congress made many allegations against me, but the STF team honestly investigated this scam
 kuch sawal khadey hone ke baad vipaksh party congress ne use aaropon main tabdeel kar diya
 He said that the entire verdict of this investigation was mine, so it should be recognized that the Madhya Pradesh government has done a good job
 congress ne madhya pradesh ko ek khooni pradesh kii tarah chhavi banane kii koshish kii
 The CM said that the Supreme Court has praised the state government for the demand of the Madhya Pradesh government to conduct a CBI inquiry
 vyaapman ghotaale main sibiai jaanch bahut jaruri tha, kyonki hamaare khilaaf kai sawaal khadey ho rahe the
 The comments ab sibiai se aagrah karata hum ve jald se jald is ghotaale kii jaanch shuru kar den
 The Congress has always demanded my resignation because they are in awe of Shivraj
 agar congress ko mujhase koi nijee dushmani dushmani he to wo mujh par nikaalen naa ki wo madhya pradesh ko badnaam karte phire
 At the same time, he refused to say anything about the post of Governor of Madhya Pradesh
 unhone kaha ki is jaanch kaa puraa faisla meraa tha, isliye is baat ko maananaa chahie ki madhya pradesh sarkaar ne acha kaam kiya he
 The Congress tried to make Madhya Pradesh a bloody state
 siem ne kaha ki madhya pradesh sarkaar dwaara sibiai jaanch karne kii maang par supreme court ne rajya sarkaar kii tarif kii he

 Many times i feel that my father dreamed of becoming a player in me and helped me to fulfill it
 aapane footbal ko hi kyon chunaa ? koi or khel kyon nahin?maine footbal ko nahin chunaa, footbal ne mujhe chunaa
 What do you think about the current state of Indian football? In which direction is Indian football going? i think this is not the right situation
 ham kahin se bhi ek ek footbal power house desh kii tarah nahin lagate
 We have two leagues (ISL and i league) but still many players do not have any contracts
 mujhe ummid he ki ek din ye sthiti sudharegi
 As we all know, there is no shortage of talent in India, yet why are we so far behind in football? Who seems to be responsible for this? There are many reasons
 jaise, footbal ajukeshan kaa abhaav, basic suvidhaon kaa naa hona
 Also, we find the worst of the lack of good scouting system
 haalanki ise kisi ek vyakti kii khami bataakar us par ungali nahin uthaai ja sakati
 We are all responsible somewhere behind this
 wales kii team pichley saal kii fifa ranking main top 100 se bhi baahar thi, is saal wo top ten main hai jabaki star khilaadiyon ke naam par unke paas sirf gareth bel or aaron ramse hai
 Do you think we will ever be able to do such charisma in the near future
 raaton-raat kuch nahin hota shaayad hamane dhyaan nahin diya lekin wales pichley 10-15 saalon se footbal ke vikaas main laga tha
 Along with the infrastructure, facilities and training to the players, Wales has improved a lot in everything
 unhone apane players ke vikaas ke liye unhen har wo cheez uplabdh karai jisaki unhen jarurat thi
 This did not happen like any magic, rather it had to happen because he had worked in the right direction from day one
 aapako kya lagata he aakhir kami kahaan he? sansadhano main, prashasnic str par, maahaul main yaa phir hamaare paas us str ke khilaadi hi nahin hai?khilaadiyon kaa level sudhaarney ke liye unhen acchhee suvidhaayen, koching ityadi milani chahie
 There should be at least one basic foundation, then somewhere their level improves
 hamaare paas kaaphi talented players hai lekin unke vikaas ke liye hamaare paas sahi saadhan nahin he
 Large population of India can also be a factor behind this
 kyonki badi aabaadi ke liye bade str par kaam karnaa padataa he
 Every village, town, city will have to work for the development of football only then it will be developed in India
 moolbhoot jaruraton ke naam par ham kisi bhi keemat par samjhauta nahin kar sakate
 How was your experience playing in Norway? Funny, i learned a lot here
 yahaan aakar maine mahasoos kiya ki tallent deveopment ke liye kaise kaam kiya jaataa he
 Here clubs invest in players keeping in mind the long-term usefulness of them
 iskaa phayda club ke saath hi players ko bhi hota he
 No moment of sports life that you can ever forget? i can never forget to make a debut for the Indian National Team
 fevorett cricket player,footballar, anya khelon ke koi hero or kyon?cricket se mujhe yuvaraj singh, dhoni, viraat kohli pasand hai
 While Messi from football and Federer from tennis are my favorite players
 ye mujhe isliye pasand hai kyonki ye auron se hatakar hai
 Any special moment of Indian dressing room, an account that you would like to share with us
 
 
 SAFF cap kaa final jeetne ke baad indian team ke dressing room main jo celibrasion hua tha, wo hameshaa ke liye yaadgaar he
 Who does Idol consider? Van der Saar (along with the Netherlands National Team, he has also been the goalkeeper of the Yuvantas and Manchester United as well)
 )padhai kahaan tak kii he? skool kaa naam, college kaa naam, fevorett subject
 
 
 i did my schooling from St
 Stephens Chandigarh while i did high school and 12th from SD Public School Chandigarh
 iske baad maine diavi college chandigarh se bie kiya he
 What do you think has changed from ISL to Indian football? ISL made Indian football more popular in India than ever before
 SAFF cap main aapane jabardast khel dikhaaya, iske liye kya special taiyaari kii thi aapane?hansate hue, SAFF cap se pehle maine teen hafte kaa vakt ghar par bitaayaa tha
 Maybe that's why i was able to perform well
 aage kaa plan kya he?aage kaa plan yahi he ki main jab bhi field main utaru to apana best duun or stabek first team ke saath hi team india ke liye bhi zyada se zyada match khelun
 Any message for your fans? Friends, we are nothing without your support
 ummid he ki aap hamen hameshaa aise hi saport karte rahenge taaki ham or aap milakar apane tirange ko ooncha, or ooncha kar paaen

 In the allocation of industries, the UP government was reprimanded by the SC, now suddenly the demand for cancellation: The Uttar Pradesh government has been reprimanded by the Supreme Court in the allocation of industries in the SC protected forest area
 darasal, rajya sarkaar ne sangrakshit jangal kshetra main udyog or anya gatividhiyon kii sitambar 1994 main ijaajat di thi
 The bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra said in a resentful manner that the government had done nothing on these wrong claims for 30 years and now the government is requesting to cancel their permission
 hairat kii baat he ki rajya sarkaar ke paas ab aavantiyon kii suchi tak nahin he
 When the government told this to the court, Justice Mishra said that on what basis are the forest officers passing the claims of those allottees? This case has also come up for hearing after one and a half years in the Supreme Court
 court ne upi sarkaar ko fatkaarte hue kaha ki 26 saal pehle ijaajat dene ke baad sarkaar itane saal tak soti rahi or ab achaanak radd karne kii maang kar rahi he
 The court said that the UP government does not have control over its officers and in the opposite court is saying that it should cancel the order without listening to the other party
 court ne upi kii yogi sarkaar ko kaha ki wo daryaft kare ki koun-koun se ilaakon main abhi bhi nae projects ko ijaajat di gai he
 The court also said that institutions like NTPC, UPEC gave land for projects blindly
 ab jab 26 saal baad wo jameen par daawa kar rahe hai to ekatarfa daawa radd karne par utaaru he, lekin ham bina aloty companiyon or logon ko sune bagaiyr is maamle main koi faisla yaa aadesh nahin de sakate
 The court said that your negligence will have serious consequences
 upi sarkaar renukut-mirzapur ke sangrakshit jangal ke kshetra main july 1994 main udyogon or anya sansthaanon ko bhoomi aavantit karne ke aadesh ko ab khaarij karne kii guhaar supreme court se laga rahi he
 The government has told the Supreme Court that forest officers and district courts are still approving the claims of those institutions, while the Supreme Court issued an order on July 19, 1994 prohibiting the encroachment of protected forest land
 saath hi ye bhi kaha tha ki is sangrakshit van bhoomi par agast 1994 ke baad kisi kaa koi bhi daawa maanya nahin hoga
 That is, ignoring the 26-year-old Supreme Court's order and disregarding the district court and forest officials, they kept doing their arbitrary for 26 years and the state government kept watching silently
 court kii naaraazgi isse he

 On Thursday, these doctors surrounded the home of Home Minister Amit Shah
 kuch na hota dekh ab ye chaatr ichha mrityu kii apil kar rahe hai
 On the other hand, according to the information, the owner of World College of Medical Sciences and Research is Narendra Singh
 is college main aniyamittaaon ko dekhte hue 2017 main embibies kaa daakhila roak diya gaya tha
 After this, in 2017, the CBI caught Narendra Singh, the director of the medical college, red handed giving 50 lakh rupees to an officer for running the college
 ghoose ke dam par ye medical college main students kaa daakhila karwaanaa chaahate the

 a railway official himself says that there is no system of checking tickets
 ho bhi kaise, jab plateform se stesan ke baahar nikalne ke liye ek darjan se zyada raste hon
 Due to the open space, ticket passengers easily exit

 The Haryana Police has arrested the serial killer with the Tantra Mantra, he has committed 7 murders in 50 cities of the country so far, committing more than 600 incidents
 magar uski ye sanak ab bhi kam nahin hui
 That too when he has gone to jail at least 40 times in crimes like robbery
 usne utaara he 7 logon ko maut ke ghat
 Kali Maa used to chant before every murder
 usne 50 shaharon main kii he 600 choriyaan
 Spent time in ten jails across the country
 yaad nahin ki usne kitni baar kii jail yatra
 He has no regrets over his actions
 usne paise ke liye tamaam vaardaaton ko diya anjaam
 Hardly anyone would be scared to see that slim man who was caught by the police
 badan kii banaavat se hi andaja lagata he ki dublaa-patala ye insaan kisi ko kis had tak nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 But when he confesses his crime with his mouth, the good people are shaken
 iskaa naam he jagataar singh
 Yes, serial killer Jagtar Singh
 iskaa aparaadhik itihaas 20 saal se bhi purana he
 During which it carried out 7 murders, 600 robberies, theft and snatching in 50 cities across the country
 isane pehla katl saal 2005 main kiya tha or ise apane kiye gaye har katl kaa saal or taarikh yaad he
 He himself does not remember how many times he has been arrested before
 faridabad kii krime branch ne jab isko pakadaa to use jaraa bhi andaja nahin tha ki uske haath kis serial killer par pade hai
 According to Jagtar, this is the first time in his crime career, when he has confessed the crimes to the police
 jagataar ke kaam karne kaa tarika kuch khaas nahin tha
 Yes, one thing was special was that he alone carried out the crime
 aise karata tha gunahjagataar akele hi vaardaat karata tha
 He did not form any of his gangs
 wo sunsaan jagahon par vaardaat karata tha
 Used to loot on the strength of sharp weapons
 zyaadaatar log usko saamaan saunp diya karte the
 Those who opposed Jagtar attacked him
 vohatyamein sua, chaaku, kanchi or duusare hathiyaaron kaa istemaal karata tha
 He did not tell anyone about the incident
 ek jagah par zyada din tak nahin rahaa karata tha
 Due to frequent change of place, the police could not get on the radar
 faridabad police jagataar kigiraftaarko wo apni badi kamyaabi maan rahi he
 He has informed the police of all the police stations for the arrest of Jagtar, in whose areas he had committed the crime
 police ko ummid he ki jagataar se poochtacha ke baad kuch or bhi vaardaat kaa khulaasa ho saktaa he
 Which had remained as a secret till now

 In a conversation with a magazine, Vidya said, "women are happier with age and their confidence also improves
 40 ke baad mahilaayein zyada hot or noti ho jaati hai
 In the male dominated society, there are all kinds of pressures on women, but with age, women become more and stop taking tension around the world

 Prior to Varanasi, Prime Minister Modi visited Ghazipur where he issued a stamp on Maharaja Suheldev
 isse pehle unhone ek medical kalege kii aadharshila bhi rakhi
 In Ghazipur, he attacked the Congress fiercely
 gajipur main yojit raily ke dauraan piem modi ne congress par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki aapke chaukeedaar ne din-raat ek kar die hai
 Some thieves have lost sleep due to the watchman
 kuch dinon main in choron ko sahi jagah pahunchaayenge
 Modi attacked the Congress's promise of loan waiver of millions of farmers, saying that in Karnataka, the Congress stole votes by saying loan waiver and after benefiting from the back door, it benefited only 800 farmers
 ye kaisaa khel, ye kaisaa dhokhaa
 Congress was sitting on the farmers file
 congress ne kisaanon ko barbaad kiya or unhen karjadaar banaaya
 It did not implement the Swaminathan Commission recommendation
 hamaari sarkaar ne ise lagu kiya
 Prime Minister Modi said that there should be a new medical college in Ghazipur, AIIMS in Gorakhpur, many modern hospitals are being constructed in Varanasi, old hospitals should be expanded, thousands of crores of health facilities are being prepared in Purvanchal
 unhone kaha ki aaj garib se garib kii bhi sunwaayee hone kaa maarg khulaa he
 This campaign to give dignified life to a person standing on the last rung of the society is still in the initial stage
 medical hub banegaa purvanchalpradhanmantri modi ne kaha ki aaj purvanchal or puure uttar pradesh kaa gaurav badhaane vaala ek or punya kaary hua he
 a postal stamp has been issued to commemorate the contribution of Maharaja Suheldev ji
 ye dak tikat lakhon kii sankhya main deshbhar ke post offis ke madhyam se desh ke ghar-ghar main pahonchega
 He further said that our government is doing the work to salute all such brave heroes of the country, who were not fully respected by the earlier governments
 unhone ne kaha, 'uttar pradesh main mere aaj ke pravaas ke dauraan, purvanchal ko desh kaa ek bada medical hub banane, krishi se jude shodh kaa mahatvapurn centre banane or upi ke laghu udyogon ko majboot karne kii disha main anek mahatvapurn kadam uthaae jaaenge
 Addressing a public meeting at RTI Ground, the grand memorial of Maharaja Suheldev, the Prime Minister said that people say that there was no need to lock houses when Maharaja Suheldev was ruled
 unhone apane shasankaal main kai lokkalyankari kaary kiye
 He was very much loved by the people
 vah sabko saath lekar chalate the
 He belonged to everyone
 modi ne rajya main maharaj suheldev kaa ek bhavy smarak banaae jane kaa elaan kiya
 Prime Minister Modi's visit to Ghazipur is very important as he tries to woo the rajbhar-pasi votes here
 haalanki unki is yatra kaa sthaneey sahyogi dal virodh kar rahe hai
 Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, an ally in the state government, has announced not to attend his program
 rajya kii yogi adityanath sarkaar main varisht mantri or suheldev bhartiya samaaj party ke adhyaksh om prakaash rajbhar pehle hi elaan kar chuke hai ki vah pradhanmantri modi ke kaarykram main shaamil nahin honge
 Om Prakash Rajbhar is upset that Maharaja Suheldev Rajbhar's full name is not mentioned on the postage stamp
 apana dal (es) bhi naarazbijepi ko uski ek anya sahyogi party apana dal (es) se bhi virodh kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Apna Dal (S) President Ashish Patel alleged at a press conference in Mirzapur that small parties from the NDA, a large constituent of the BJP, were feeling ignored
 uttar pradesh kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se apana dal (es) kii 15 se adhik siton par upasthiti he
 Kurmi and Patel are its main voters and about one lakh of them are only in the Prime Minister's constituency
 gajipur ke baad varanasiiske badpradhanmantri modi varanasijaayenge or yah pichley do maheene main apane nirvachan kshetra main unki duusari yatra hogi
 Modi's visit to Varanasi is also important in this context as Pravasi Bharatiya Divas is to be held here from January 21, whose preparations are in their final stages
 varanacimen pradhanmantri 'rashtriya beej anusandhan evam prashikshan centre' ke parisar main 'antarrashtriya chaaval anusandhan santhaan' or 'dakshin asia kshetreey centre' ko raashtra ko samarpit karenge
 This rice research institute will become an important center for rice research and training in South Asia and SAARC countries
 modi pichley saal november main antarrashtriya chaaval anusandhan santhaan ke philippines sthit mukhyalay gaye the
 Apart from this, Prime Minister Modi will also participate in the 'one District One Product' regional summit in Deendayal Hastakala Sankul
 dilli ravaanaa hone se pehle vah bunakaron or hastshilpiyon se mulaakaat karenge
 Earlier, he came to Varanasi on 12 November
 tab unhone kai pariyojnaon kii shuruyaat karne ke baad jansabha ko sambodhit bhi kiya tha

 Barack Obama
 ye shabdon ke jariye aisa sammohan paidaa karte hai, jo har tarah ke logon ko baandhne main sakasham ho
 Barack Obam did exactly the same on his tour of India
 ve uchit sthaan par sateek baaten bolte hai
 They speak the language of money in front of the Dhankubers in Mumbai, and in the capital of the country, they are seen darting in front of the politicians
 obama in rajanetaaon kii kamajoriyon se bhaleebhanti waakif hai, jinhone pichley 50 saalon main apane kisi bade nayak ko bhulaayaa nahin he
 That is why he mentioned Mahatma Gandhi, Babasaheb Ambedkar and Swami Vivekananda in the speech and looted a lot of applause in return
 sansad kaa bhavy central haul taaliyon se gunj uthaa
 He proved the critics wrong, who had earlier said that if Obama gives it to the country, he will do nothing but take away everything
 chaliye, yah baat bhi ek had tak thik hi he
 Obama is taking a multi-million dollar deal from India to America
 isse vahaan hajaaron bhartiyon paidaa hongi
 In return, the US has supported India for a permanent membership of the Security Council
 yah ek aisa mudda he, jise manmohan singh apane desh main bhunaane main samaksh honge
 As far as terrorism is concerned, Obama has only given a slight threat to Pakistan

 bhartiya janata party gujarat main congress kii chadhaai ko thaamne main safal rahi he or apane is majboot garh par kabja barkaraar rakhti najar aa rahi he
 The results of the India today-axis-my-india exit poll indicate this
 agsit pole main bijepi ko 182 sadasyeey vidhansabhaon main 99-113 seat milane kaa anumaan jataayaa gaya he
 As far as the Congress alliance is concerned, it may have to be satisfied with only 68-82 seats
 2012 chunaav kii tulana main is baar bijepi kaa vot share 1% girane kaa anumaan he
 In 2012 BJP got 48% votes, so this time the party is getting 47% votes
 haalanki congress ke vot share main 2012 chunaav kii tulana main 3% voton kaa ijapha hota najar aa rahaa he
 Congress received 39% of the votes in 2012
 is chunaav main congress ko 42% vot milane kaa anumaan he
 The axis-my-india exit poll has shown good gains for the Congress in 54 seats in Saurashtra and Kutch
 uttar gujarat kii 32 siton par bhi congress kaa pradarshan acha rahaa he
 But the BJP has traditionally been seen crossing the finishing line due to its strong performance in its strongholds in South and Central Gujarat
 ahmedabad kii 21 siton par bhi bijepi ke liye yahi baat kahi ja sakati he
 a look at the region-wise results in the exit poll shows why mixed signs were coming from political pundits and leaders during the election campaign
 saurashtra, kuccha or kuch had tak uttar gujarat main leuva or kadva patel, thakor, coli or dalit votaron ne bade paimaane par congress ke liye vot kiya he
 But the party could not achieve the same kind of voters' trust in the seats of Central and South Gujarat and 21 seats in Ahmedabad district
 agsit pole sanket detaa he ki agar congress ne dakshin or madhya gujarat main hardik patel, alpesh thakor or jignesh mewaani ke saath chunaav se teen-chaar maheene pehle hi gathbandhan kar liya hota to nateezon main uskaa kahin behatar pradarshan saamne aata
 Since 1995, the 2017 elections have been a difficult and tiring battle for the BJP, which has been in power in Gujarat
 22 saal kii anti-inkambency (satta virdohi rujhaan) ne bhagava party kii chhavi ko is chunaav main aghat lagaaya
 But if BJP is successful in crossing the finishing line, then there are two important and big reasons for this
 pehla, ek gujarati ke desh ke pradhanmantri hone ko lekar rajya ke logon kii ore se garv mahasoos karnaa
 And second, the formidable organizational election machinery led by BJP President Amit Shah
 ye dekhnaa dilachasp he ki exis-maay-india agsit pole saurashtra, kuccha or uttar gujarat main siton kii sankhya ko lekar congress ko bijepi se aage dikhaa rahaa he
 Out of the total 54 seats in Saurashtra and Kutch, the Congress is projected to lead in 30 seats, while only 23 seats of BJP are seen
 uttari gujarat kii 32 siton main se congress ko 18 siton par badhat kaa anumaan he
 In northern Gujarat, BJP may have to be satisfied with only 14 seats
 madhya or dakshin gujarat ke saath hi ahmedabad main bijepi ko ajey badhat milti dikh rahi he
 Of the total 40 seats in central Gujarat, BJP seems to get 29 seats
 yahaan congress ko sirf 11 seat milane kaa anumaan he
 Out of 35 seats in South Gujarat, BJP is ahead in 25 seats, here only 10 seats are seen in Congress account
 agsit pole dikhaata he ki jiesti or notebandi ne shahari kshetron main bijepi kii sambhaavnaaon ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaaya he
 Talking about urban Gujarat, the BJP is going on to a spectacular performance by sweeping 42 seats out of the total of 55 seats
 gujarat ke kaarobaari beshak jiesti ko lekar nakhushi jataane main mukhar rahe hon lekin matdaan ke din unhone bijepi ke saath khadey rahanaa hi pasand kiya
 Congress is expected to get only 13 seats in urban areas
 surat, vadodara or ahmedabad jaise vanijyik kshetron main congress kii ek baar phir buree gat banati dikh rahi he
 As far as the 127 rural seats of Gujarat are concerned, there has been a close fight between BJP and Congress here
 gramin gujarat main bijepi 64 seat par jeet hasil karti najar aa rahi hai
 At the same time, Congress is also seen to compete with the BJP by winning 62 seats
 ye bhi ittefaq hi he ki gramin gujarat main bijepi or congress donon ko hi barabari kaa vot share yani 45%-45% vot mil rahe hai
 Talking about caste statistics, Gujarat exit poll throws light on the minds of Gujarati voters
 gujarat kii leuva patel prabhutv vaali 12 siton par congress ko 8 or bijepi ko 4 siton par jeet milti najar aa rahi he
 The Congress is projected to get 3 seats out of the four seats in the Kadva Patels-dominated state
 saaf he ki hardik patel factor ne patidaaron ke asar vaali siton par bijepi ko kadi chot pahunchaai he
 These seats were earlier considered strong bastions of BJP
 congress ko alpesh thakor ke saath gathbandhan ne thakoron ke prabhaav vaali siton par laabh pahunchaaya he
 Out of the 25 seats of Thakor-bearing Congress, 13 seats are seen in the account of Congress
 bijepi ko yahaan 12 seat milane kaa hi anumaan he
 The BJP seems to be doing well by winning 35 out of the 52 seats under the influence of Other Backward Castes (OBC)
 congress ko sirf 16 obisi prabhutv vaali siton se santosh karnaa pad saktaa he
 In the rural areas, the effect of the Patidar voters uniting in support of the Congress was also that the votes of the rival communities were gathered on the other side
 ye dekhnaa bhi dilachasp he ki patidaar or thakor andolanon kaa asar sirf uttar gujarat main hi dekha gaya jahaan sehardik patel or alpeshthakor taalluk rakhte hai
 As far as South and Central Gujarat are concerned, the Patidars and Thakores have voted for the BJP in large numbers
 pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah gujarat ke adivasee ilaakon main paith banane ke liye kadi mehnat karte rahe hai
 This strategy has been very effective for BJP
 gujarat kii 28 adivasee bahut siton par bijepi 17 siton par badhat hasil karti najar aa rahi he
 At the same time, the Congress is expected to get 11 seats
 bijepi ke liye ye chintaa kii baat he ki yuva votaron par uski pakad dhili hoti najar aa rahi he
 Talking about the age group, the Congress has gained an edge over the BJP only in terms of supporting voters between the ages of 18 and 25 years
 is aayu varg main congress ko 45 fisadi vot milane kaa anumaan he
 At the same time, BJP seems to get 1% less i

 After the big cases of bank fraud against liquor baron Vijay Mallya and diamond trader Nirav Modi, the entire nation's attention has shifted to the industrialists who have taken loans from banks

 kyonki artiai ke tahat privet bainkon ne jaankaree saajha nahin kii he
 Also most of the public banks have expressed their inability to provide such data

 In this, the first question was asked, how much debt did the public sector banks give to the industrialists? The second question was asked, how much private banks gave loans to these industrialists?

 meri sarkaar dwaara tay kiye gaye paardarshita ke ucchtam mandandon ko aage badhaane ke liye meri sarkaar ne sarkari kharid ko ek hi plateform ''government i marketspls"—jiiem (jem) par laa diya he
 "this message of President Pranab Mukherjee in Parliament opens as soon as the Gem portal is opened
 darasal, sarkari vibhaagon main saamaan kharidne kii prakriya ko or paardarshee banane ke liye kendriya vaanijya mantralay ne 9 agast 2016 ko ek bada kadam uthaaya
 Under this, the Director General of Supply and Distribution (DGSND), which determines the rate of government procurement, made a provision to digitalize all government purchases
 iske liye sarkaar ne lambey samay se chali aa rahi rate contract (aarasi) paddati ko khatm kar diya
 The RC method used to be that DGSND fixed the lowest price of thousands of varieties of goods and departments had to purchase goods at the same price
 dijiesendi ke ek varisht adhikari bataate hai ki aarasi paddati ke tahat har saal 2,500 karod ru
 Was procured while the rest was procured through tender and departmental processes
 saal bhar main centre sarkaar or sarkari upakramon main 2 lakh karod ru
 Services and goods are purchased (see box: Gem Burn)
 dijiesendi ke mutabik, anivaaryta kaa niyam lagaae jane ke baad march 2017 main hi jem se 300 karod ru
 Purchased over
 dijiesendi ke mahanideshak vinay kumaar ne india today ko bataaya, ''jem ke madhyam se ab sarkari kharid puri tarah paardarshee ho gai he
 Any department can visit Gem and buy goods from the vendor providing the lowest price
 ye keemten aarasi, duusare online portal or bazaar se kam rate par jem par uplabdh hai
 This will cost the government exchequer millions
 kaa phayda hoga
 "to better compare prices, Gem has also compromised the" pricedekho "portal
 lekin 2 lakh karod ru
 Seven mps of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a minister in the Modi government and a member of the opposition, over hundreds of crores in letters addressed to Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on the credibility of the portal that made the purchase transparent
 kaa ghotaalaa hone kaa andeshaa jataayaa he
 minister-mps expressed the biggest digital scam of bjp's Lok Sabha MP from Muzaffarpur in Andeshabihar, Ajay Nishad, in a strict language, warned the government treasury from Gem portal to be a huge loss
 sitaraman ko 20 march ko likhe patr main nishad ne kaha, ''jem ke saath bahut sari moolbhoot or prakriyaagat khamiyaan hai, isse jem kharidaar or vikreta, donon ke liye bhrashtachar kaa adda ban gaya he
 Due to this, the buyers i
e
 the central government and its departments are facing huge economic losses
 " nishad ne kaha, ''aniyamitata ke aise bahut-se maamle saamne aae hai, jahaan adhikariyon ne jem kii technical or prakriyaagat khaamiyon se phayda uthaaya he
 It is clear that some people in DGSND are deliberately taking advantage of irregularities to commit corruption and damage the government exchequer
 " isi baat ko or aage badhaate hue maharashtra ke gatchiroli se bhaajapa saansad ashok em
 Nete wrote to Sitharaman, "if the buyer or seller misuses the portal due to the flaws in the Gem portal, then the DGSND officials do not have the right to take action against them
 isse aane vaale maheenon main bhrashtachar kaa aakaar kai sau karod ru
 Can be of " saansad vaanijya mantri se aagrah karte hai, ''nivedan he ki dijiesendi se rate contract khatm karne par spashtikaran maangen
 "member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology and bjp's Lok Sabha MP from Uttar Pradesh Basti, Harish Dwivedi, wrote a letter to Sitharaman on 9 March 2017 warning of the scam
 saansad ne likhaa, ''yah prathit ho rahaa he ki centre sarkaar ke dijiesendi rate contract ko purnataya band kar government i market place yaa jem portal se sarkaar ne apni vastu aapurti kii yojana ko payalat project kerup main chaalu kiya he, parantu abhi tak is payalat project main anek khamiyaan hai
 
 
 Due to this, the central government is likely to suffer financial losses in future
 jab tak jem portal puri tarah viksit nahin ho jaataa tab tak rate contract ko chaalu rakhen
 "kaushal Kishore, a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Internal Affairs and BJP MP from Uttar Pradesh's Mohanlalganj Lok Sabha seat, expressed similar fears by writing a letter to Commerce Minister Sitharaman on 25 February
 kishor ne kaha, ''jem payalat project ke rup main sanchalit kiya gaya he, iske sanchaalan main anek takneekee or vittiya khamiyaan hai, jo abhi purnroopen paardarshee na hone ke kaaran vittiya haani kii sambhaavna darsha rahaa he
 "pointing out the portal to take advantage of the wrong people, Kishore wrote," Gem needs to be made more transparent
 agar aisa nahin kiya jaataa to iskaa laabh galat tareeke se uthaane hetu kuch log sakriy ho chuke hai, jiskaa bhavishya main saamaajik virodh hone kii apaar sambhaavna prathit ho rahi he
 "(see: whistleblower turned MP) Anuj Aggarwal, the director of the fundamental Bharat Trust, who first questioned the credibility of Gem, says," In theory, this arrangement is wonderful
 isse sarkari khajaane ko phayda hona chahie
 But the functionality of the Gem portal running with a team of just 40-50 people countered thousands of employees and billions of rupees
 ke nivesh se chal rahe antarrashtriya portalon se karnaa kathin he
 "A slight flaw of technology opens the door to immense possibilities of corruption
 or saansad isi baat kii ore ishaara kar rahe hai
 The biggest basis for applying the goodsjam sold at a higher price than RC was that the product prices on the Gem would be lower than the RC prices
 yah baat isliye khaasi mahatvapurn he kyonki aarasi kii kharid ko sarkari tantra itnaa vishwasaneey maanata tha ki isse hone vaali kharid ko sieji or sivisi kii jaanch se chhot mili thi
 dgsnd's internal report obtained by India Today shows that in six models of electronic energy meters, the meter price is higher than the meter price fixed on RC
 isi tarah electronic digital postal franking mashin ke chaar modelon kaa rate bhi aarasi main tay kiye gaye rate se zyada paaya gaya
 In a note issued on March 25, DGSND Vinay Kumar himself admitted, " It is a matter of concern that the prices of many products uploaded to Gem are higher than the RC prices
" " jab jem lagu hone ke aath maheene baad bhi jem par bahut se utpaada aarasi se mahange hai to jem ko hadabadi main anivaary karne kii tuk samaj nahin aati
 Secondly, where will the expensive purchases made during this period and additional burden on the state exchequer be compensated? is puri prakriya par dijiesendi or sarkaar maun he
 Tampering with reverse bidding and expensive buyer-bidding from the market means that a company makes its bid on the product and if the other company bids less than that, the first company has the right to quote a new rate
 boli lagane kii prakriya ko saat din tak khole rakhane kaa praavdhaan he taaki har company ko nunatam boli lagane kaa mauka mili or sarkari kharid sabase kam daam par sambhav ho sake
 During august-september 2016, India Today investigation revealed more than a dozen such cases, where reverse bidding was stopped before seven days
 in maamalon main karodon ru
 Purchased masalan, jem ke archive main jaaen to 13 sitambar, 2016 ko 360 tablet kharidne kii bid daali or agle din band kar di gai, is tarah saat din tak reverse biding kaa mauka die bina hi 33
 66 lakhs
 ke tablet kharid liye gaye
 Many such cases have come up in the investigation when a government department has bought some goods from Gem, while the price of the same product is less on private portal
 aise bhi utpaada dekhne main aa rahe hai, jinaki keemat jem par zyada or nijee portalon par kam he (dekheh jem par mahangaa kharida, online portal par sasta)
 The fact is that the "pricedekho" portal is providing the rates of similar models on different portal rather than comparing the rates of the same model on different portals
 dijiesendi ke ek sutara ne bataaya, ''dikkat yah he ki jo kaam amejan yaa duusari companiyaan hajaaron logon kii team or karodon ru
 The same thing is done with software made with the investment of 40, with a team of 40-50 people in Gem and with a modest investment
 isiilie jin filtron kaa zikr jem main kiya gaya he, bahut-se maamalon main ve kaam nahin kar pate or bhrashtachar kaa rasta khul jaataa he
 "although a top DGSND official said," Some big vendors were reaping profits in the RC system, they are lobbying through mps if their interests get hurt
 " is adhikari kii baat sahi bhi ho sakati he
 But this does not eliminate the question, what steps does the central government take to compensate for the costly purchases made on Gem since August 2016? And now the government is taking a risk by handing over the entire work of DGSND to Jem, bypassing the opposition of its minister-mps, anyway it is directly Rs 2 lakh crore
 kii kharid ko online karne kaa maamla he, kisi ne jem kii takneekee khami kaa phayda uthaa liya to is ghotaale kaa aakaar desh main ab tak ke sabase bade kathith 2ji ghotaale ke 1
 76 lakh crore Rs
 kii rakam se bhi bada hoga

 Low intensity blasts occurred in Kanpur and Mumbai on Wednesday following a suicide attack on CRPF personnel in Pulwama
 iske baad suraksha agenciyaan alert par hai
 The explosion in the toilet of Kalindi Express's general bogie in Kanpur took place on Wednesday evening, in which the toilet and battery box were blown apart, while the explosion occurred in front of Thakur Mall on Mira Road in Thane
 haalanki, in donon ghatnaon main kisi tarah ke janahani kii khabar nahin he
 Security agencies have received a bag from the blast site in Kanpur
 isamen jaish agent ke naam dhamkee bharaa latter bhi he
 It has threatened to blow up the stage of kanpur-delhi Shatabdi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 iske saath hi teen or hamale karne kii baat patr main kahi gai he
 At the same time, SP Sanjeev Suman has confirmed to receive a letter after the blast in the train
 jis par hindi main jaish-e-mohammad likhaa he
 But according to SP, it looks like someone's prank
 haalanki puri jaanch hone ke baad hi sach saamne aayega
 Two blasts on the same day
 
 
 kis sajeesh kii ore he ishaara
 
 
 a day after the Pulwama attack, two blasts point towards a major conspiracy of Jaish
 kaha ja rahaa he ki chote dhamaake kar jaish-e-mohammad desh main khauf kaa maahaul paidaa karnaa chahta he
 Hence the explosions are being done
 mumbai main bhi aties alert
 
 
 If sources are to be believed, there is a big reason for agencies to be alerted after the blast on Mira Road
 forensik team ko dhamaake kii jagah se plastic bottle, lohe ke chharre, safed powder mila he, jo aamtaur par aatanki bhi kisi dhamaake ko anjaam dene ke liye istemaal karte rahe hai
 Sources even say that the blasts were done as trials, which failed
 philhal ATS sahit tamaam agenciyaan maukey par pahunchakar jaanch main jute gai hai

 sunil grover se ladaai ke baad lagata he kapil sharma kaa samay bilkul acha nahin chal rahaa
 After the backing of Sunil Grover, Ali Asgar, Chandan Prabhakar from 'the Kapil Sharma Show', the show's TRP has gone down and now news is coming that Sony Entertainment Channel is going to shut down 'the Kapil Sharma Show'
 kapil ke jagah ek nayaa sho shuru hoga, jisamen sunil grover main lead honge
 DNA quoted a source as saying, 'the channel's Sunil is very disappointed with Kapil's scuffle with Grover
 unhone jitna sochaa tha, usase zyada sho kii retings gir gayi
 If this continues, then they will not sign Kapil at all
 ho saktaa he puraa sho hi band kar diya jaae
 Before the return of Sunil Grover, Kapil Sharma demanded an increase in fees! The channel wants to focus on Sunil and create a new show with him
 ladaai ke baad colors channel ne sunil ko nae sho ke liye approach kiya lekin sunil ne abhi tak kuch sin nahin kiya he
 Sunil's doctors famous Gulati and Rinku Bhabhi's characters are owned by Sony
 channel ko sunil ke live sho se bhi paise milte the
 Hi
 
 i am Ravish Kumar
 jin jin logon ne jandhan yojana ke tahat khate nahin khulawaayen unhen jaldi khulavaa lenaa chahie
 There will be two benefits from this
 desh kii aabaadi kaa zyada se zyada hissaa bank network main aa jayega or jab kaledhan kaa hissaa bantega to lene ke liye sabake paas pehle se bank khaataa rahegaa
 The kind of legal political activism that is being seen on this issue, now it should be expected that if black money comes and comes, then every person will get three lakh rupees
 bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apni chunavi reliyon main yahi vaada kiya tha
 If it has come or taken out from here, then black money will become the real Jan Dhan, because now the Supreme Court has taken the responsibility of investigating how black money will come
 adaalat ne kaha ki blike mani kaise waapas aegi jaanch kaise hogi isaki zimmedaari ham lete hai
 You do not have to worry about the account holders, SIT will handle it
 ham ab kaala dhan laane ke masale ko sarkaar par nahin chhod sakate hai
 In this way it will never come in our time
 aapaki jaanch kabhi puri hi nahin hogi
 You hand over all the information and names from abroad
 sarkaar ko ab is maamle main zyada chintaa yaa jaanch karne kii zarurat nahin he
 The court sought information from the government about the accounts of all Indians who have accounts in foreign banks
 centre sarkaar se kaha ki aap aise logon ke liye protective ambrella yani bachaav kii chhatari kyon ban rahe hai
 Why are you saving such people? supreme court ne centre sarkaar kii us daleel ko khaarij kar diya ki videshi bainkon main jamaa logon ke naam jaanch se pehle bataane par videshi sandhiyon kaa ulanghan hoga
 Even today, the Attorney General has said in the court that if the names were shared, the investigation would face difficulty
 bhavishya main jaankaree nahin milegi or kaala dhan waapas laane main pareshaani aegi
 Those who do not have black money in their account, their privacy will be violated, that is, the name will be infamous
 yahi daleel dete hue vittamantri arun jetali ne apane blog main likhaa tha ki ham kanoon kii prakriyaaon ke tahat hi naam zaahir karenge
 But the Supreme Court has rejected the government's argument for the last several days and has also taken up the work of investigation in this matter
 kaha he ki jab tak ham monitor nahin karenge kuch ho hi nahin saktaa
 What could be a bigger shock than this
 aap jaanate hai ki sarkaar ne somvaar ko teen logon ke naam jaahir kiye to hangaamaa ho gaya ki isamen nayaa kya he
 The names of these three have already become public
 in teenon ne camere ke saamne aakar khandan kiya balki ediaar ne yah bhi bataa diya ki inamen se ek goa kii mining company timblo privet limited ke diarector radha timblo ne congress or bijepi ko donon ko hi chanda diya he
 There can be a view that the names of those who are trying to avoid political parties by giving donations, but the question arose that these are minor names
 kya ve bade log bhi dhare jaaenge jinke chanda dene kaa maamuli pramaan miltaa he, magar jinaki bhoomika ke bare main gaanv dehaat tak main log kayaas lagaate hai
 Ram Jethmalani, the petitioner, has started showing the result of Prashant Bhushan's activism
 ab to bijepi netaa subramanyam swami ne bhi vittamantri ko khat likh diya he ki sabhi ke naam bataaen jaae
 The court has stamped the words of these three in a way
 swami ne yah bhi kaha ki france or jamarni ne to apane aap ye naam bheje hai
 i do not know what the government is doing
 maine vittamantri ko khat likhaa he ki videshon main sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi kaa kaala dhan jamaa he
 But no action has been taken
 bhaajapa se nilambit sadsy ram jethmalani ne bhi vittamantri ko khat likhaa tha ki aapane jin 18 logon ke naam die hai, usamen hasan ali jaise dalal kaa naam nahin he
 This is very unfortunate
 to kya adaalat ke is faisle ne kaala dhan ke mudde par bijepi or sarkaar kii daleelon ko kavach utaar diya he
 The moral force of the claims of time being reduced or investigation being honest has weakened
 faisla aate hi aam aadmi party ke netaa arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki har kaala dhan vaale ko ye kaha jaae ki apana jis din tumne account kholaa tha, tab se lekar aaj tak kii puri bank statement do
 When he gives a complete bank statement, in every transaction, you will know from whom the money came and to whom the money went
 jab har transaction kii investigeshan kii jaaegi to or bahut sara paisa nikal kar aayega or kai nae bank accounts usamen se nikal kar aaenge
 The way the Supreme Court has taken a stand today, a ray of hope has arisen
 aaj kaafii strong faisalaa nazar aa rahaa he
 Both the Congress and now the BJP hide the name of the black money and are seen protecting
 congress ke pravaktaa ajay maakan ne kaha ki 2011 main arun jetali to kehete the ki videshi mulkon se tex samjhaute ke kaaran naam bataane main koi dikkat nahin he, vah ab kyon kah rahe hai ki mushkil he
 Maken said that we are happy that the Supreme Court has rejected both the affidavits of the Government of India and said that all the names should be given to the Supreme Court
 congress ko ummid he ki na keval naam balki jaise baba ramdev kaha karte the ki 5000 se zyada naam hai har ek vyakti ke khate main itnaa paisa aayega ki 15 lakh rupee aa jaaenge
 We would like the government to bring 5000 names soon

 marane kaa tareeqa jis diary main likhaa tha wo bhi ghar main mili
 Ten mobiles, an ipad, 65 thousand cash and all jewelry were found lying in the house
 naa koi baahar se ghar main aayaa naa koi ghar se baahar gaya
 The death rehearsal took place for 6 days before death
 phir saatven din maut haqiqat ban gai
 All the evidence, all the photographs, all the circumstances are just saying that eleven people died nothing but suicide in the house of Burari on the night of 30th June
 dilli police kii krime branch ke sutron kaa kahana he ki is samuhik maut ke peeche kisi bhi bahari kaa haath nahin he
 However, the police also say that eleven of eleven people were not ready to die together

 After the ritual every night, the whole family practiced hanging in the same hall like the banyan tree twigs
 bas fark ye tha ki tab sabhi ke haath pair aankh kaan munh sabhi khule rahaa karte the
 There is no stool or chair below even under the feet
 pair zamin par hi tike hote
 Although the noose was definitely around the neck

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has given this call to his workers
 dilli main desh bhar se ikaitha hue congress ke pravaktaaon ko rahul gandhi sakaaratmak soch kaa sabak sikhaa rahe hai
 The motive is preparation for mission 2014
 rahul ne kaha ki darane kii nahin balki ladane kii jarurat he taaki sach ko saamne laayaa ja sake
 Rahul said to change the thinking and bring change in the country with positive thinking
 rahul kii is paathshaala main congress kaaryakartaaon ko soshal media ke istemaal kii bhi training di jaaegi
 So that the Congress can compete strongly in the cyber war over the election
 gauratlab he ki congress ne dilli main desh bhar ke kareeb 100 se zyada pravaktaaon kii workshop bulaai he
 The two-day workshop was inaugurated by Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi
 jawahar bhawan main yojit workshop main pi chidambaram, anand sharma, jairam ramesh or manish tiwari jaise kai bade netaa pravaktaaon ko sambodhit karenge
 In this workshop, the spokespersons will be told to respond to the misunderstandings being spread by the opposition
 shashi tharur is sammelan ko video conferecing ke jariye sambodhit karenge or vartmaan samay main samvaad se judi chunautiyon ke bare main bataayenge
 Chidambaram will talk on the subject of economy while Anand Sharma will talk about FDI policy in manufacturing sector
 is sammelan ke dauraan congress party desh main party ke vichaaron ko failaane ke liye nayaa manch pesh karegi or party pravaktaa sandip dikshit is sammelan main hissaa lene waalon ko shodh ke tareekon ke bare main bataayenge
 There is a situation of outcry in the Congress party after a bitter defeat in the Lok Sabha elections
 rahul gandhi adhyaksh pad chhodane par ad gaye hai to party ne ab apane pravaktaaon ko tivi dibates se dur rahane kii hidaayat de di he
 But when the Congress order came on Thursday morning, shortly after that the spokesperson Rashid Alvi arrived to participate in the discussion on our news channel Aaj Tak
 haalanki, jaise hi unke bolne kii baari ai to raashid alvi yah kahkar uth gaye ki unhen party ke faisle kii jaankaree abhi mili he, isliye vah dibet ko bich main chhod rahe hai
 While leaving Mike, Congress spokesperson Rashid Alvi said that i was told that there would be a debate on the upcoming challenge of the government, but i did not even get a voice

 com / e8gwozwiol - Aaj Tak (@aajtak) May 30, 2019 He further said that i did not know that the party has asked the spokespersons not to participate in the debate, they have come to know through your channel
 aise main vah bich main ye bahes chhodkar ja rahe hai
 However, Rashid Alvi was participating in the debate from 10 am
 or kareeb 40 minute baad bahes chhodkar gaye
 While Congress leader Randeep Surjewala tweeted the order related to the party spokespersons at 8 am
 
 @incindiahas decided to not send spokespersons on television debates for a month
 All media channels / editors are requested to not place Congress representatives on their shows
 - Randeep Singh Surjewala (@rssurjewala) May 30, 2019 Such a surprising thing is that if the news has reached the whole country through the tweet, then how can the spokespersons of the party themselves miss it
 bataa den ki congress party ko ek baar phir loksabhaa chunaav main karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 In 2014, the Congress was reduced to 44 and in 2019 the Congress was reduced to 52
 isi ke baad guuruuvaar subah party ne faisla liya he ki agle ek maheene tak party kaa koi bhi pravaktaa tivi dibates main shaamil nahin hoga
 He has also appealed to TV channel editors not to call his party spokespersons in their debates
 reating:ek starramgopal verma kii satya ne 1998 main jabardast tahalaka machaaya tha or bollywood main anderworld ke nae chehre ko pesh kiya tha
 After this film, he gave best films like Company and Sarkar
 pichley kuch dinon se unki satya-2 ko lekar sargharmiyaan thim
 But the film appears to add another failure to Ramu's name
 unhone ek koshish kii lekin apni pichhali sabhi koshishon kii tarah unhone niraash kiya
 The film does not connect with its previous film in any way and does not connect the audience with itself in any way
 yah kahana galata nahin hoga ki satya agar bollywood main mile kaa pathar thi, to yah film aisi he, jise bollywood yaad nahin rakhana chahega
 Seeing the film, it can be said that he has lost his magic touch
 kahani main kitna damek yuva he, uskaa anderworld par chaa jane kaa khwab he
 Just then he proceeds to fulfill his dream and comes to Mumbai
 lekin kahani main itane jhol hai ki yah kahin bhi conect nahin karti he, or ek samay par aakar bojhil hoti najar aati he
 Not a single star of the film does anything amazing
 puneeth singh kahin-kahin achche baaki jagah kuch bhi asar nahin chhodte hai
 Anika Soti has also been a useless beauty
 baaki sab aate-jate rahete hai
 The budget of the film is about 15-20 crores
 bataaya ja rahaa he
 There is very little talk about the name x Factor in the film
 raamu puri film main kuch uljhe se najar aate hai, or kahani kabhi trek par nahin aa paati he
 Hence, the film is unlikely to be very fortunate in terms of earnings
 yah kahana galat nahin hoga ki sholay kaa rimek banaakar raamu ne khub aalochana jheli thi
 Now, after 15 years, he has done the same thing by making a sequel of Satya

 grih mantri chidabaram ne is baithak main kaha ki andhra pradesh main halaat ab badal chuke hai or telugana masale kaa hal nikaalnaa hi hoga
 However, the leaders who came out of the meeting seemed dissatisfied with this
