 police ko soochna mili thi ki ek sthaan par avaidh kataai kii ja rahi he
 Some people are cutting buffalo
 police vahaan avaidh kataai rokane ke liye pahunchi to peeche se dharm ke thekedaar gaurakshak bhi pahunch gaye
 The matter was not even of the cow dynasty, yet these people took up the law in front of the police there
 tathakthith gorakshakon ne aaropee ko police ke kabje se chin kar peeta
 The people who were illegally harvesting the buffalo, lashed out in front of the police
 police in logon ke saamne bebas or laachaar dikh rahi thi

 Their fault was only that they had cows in their hands
 or unke dimag main ye baitha hua tha ki ye gomance khaane vaale darinde hai
 For broken ribs one is proposed to give twenty thousand rupees and a farmer with a broken elbow is being given an amount of ten thousand
 taaki ye donon apane cese waapas le len
 Bhup Singh says that this is atrocity in the name of cow protection, which has no hearing

 Even if their cow falls ill, they do not take them to the hospital to show them
 sab kuch gaanv main hi karnaa padataa he
 Anything can happen outside the village
 goraksha ke naam par kisi kii jaan bhi ja sakati he
 The condition is that the farmers do not take the cows out of the village even for grazing
 ghaki se gaayon ko lekar baahar nikalnaa bhi mushkil he
 The so-called guards should be seen carrying people only carrying cows
 phir wo nahin poochhate hai ki gaay lekar jane vaale hindu hai yaa musalmaan
 They raise or smuggle cows
 gorakshak bas kau tex vasuulana shuru kar dete hai
 Bhup Singh and Jabar Singh also kept explaining to them that they are Gopalak farmers but the self-proclaimed contractors did not hear anything

 In Bastar, Chhattisgarh, Naxalites have opened factories for making native and traditional weapons in many areas
 zyaadaatar ilaako main krishi aujaaron ke nirmaan kii aad main rambo tir banane kaa gorakh dhandha chal rahaa hai
 However, due to the pressure of the security forces and police raids in the tool factories since the month, their construction has come down
 aaj tak or india today kii team ne bastar ke un gaanv kaa jayja liya, jahaan behad gopneey tareeke se rambo tir banane kaa kaam joro par hai
 Most of the houses have been converted into factories
 There are several villages in Sukma Narayanpur and Bijapur in Bastar, where Rambo arrows are being stolen in the houses
 is tarah ke kaarkaane kholane kii pahal naksaliyon ne hi kii hai
 For this, the rooms of some of the houses of the township are being used as a factory
 yah kaam chori chhipe to ho hi rahaa he
 No one has ear to ear about the native weapons made here
 chaahe sthaneey gramin ho yaa phir police or suraksha balon ke log, unhen bhanak bhi nahin he ki gramin ilaako ke kai log naksaliyon ke dabaav or laalach ke chakkar main rambo tir banane ke kaam main jute hai
 How the villagers become Rambo The villagers have got the job of making Rambo arrows these days due to the lack of weapons and bullets in their team
 rambo tir ke saamne ke hisse main grenet shell jaisaa mekensm hota hai
 This shell is made from aluminum and iron body
 shell ke saamne ke hisse main barood or chharre bhare jate hai
 When it collides with the body of the security forces, the circuit mechanism is complete and explodes
 visphot ke dauraan rambo shell ke saamne ke hisse main bhare hue chharre suraksha balon ke sharir ko jakhmi kar dete he
 As soon as the soldiers are injured, the Naxalites bombard them with bullets
 gaanv ke kuch ek gharon main rot aayran, bel metal or lohari ke kaam ke thikaane mili
 What most people deny is that they also have the work of making Rambo arrows
 lekin jaankaron kii maane to bandook kii nok par naksali in logo se rambo tir banavaate he
 In a day, artisans can make 15 to 20 Rambo arrows
 lohe ko naram kar rambo tir kii shakl di jaati he
 For this, iron rods and pipes are melted in extreme temperature
 iske saamne ke hisse ko pola rakhaa jaataa he, taaki usame barood or lohe ke chharre bhare ja sake
 Only Rambo arrows are manufactured in these factories
 isamen barood or chharre bharne kaa kaam naksali karte he
 Hunarmand villager gets remuneration of two and a half solar rupees per day for preparing Rambo arrow
 javaanon ke khilaaf rambo tir kaa karte he istemaalapahale sukama ke bhejji main 11 march 2017 ko CRPF ke jawaano par naksaliyon ne ghaat laga ke hamalaa kiya tha
 The Naxals opened fire in this attack with AK 47, INSAS rifle and indigenous guns
 lekin baad main pataa chalaa kii naksaliyon ne is dauraan rembo tir kaa bhi istemaal kiya tha
 Usually, even through the arrow command, the Naxalites have damaged the security forces on many occasions
 lekin ye pehla mauka tha jab suraksha balon par hamale ke liye naksaliyon ne rambo tir kaa istemaal kiya
 After this, Rambo arrows are being used in continuous attacks
 CRPF ne bhi qamar kas lee hafilhal rambo tir ke istemaal par roak lagane ke liye police or kendriya suraksha balon ne bhi qamar kas lee he
 Suspicious houses are being searched in village towns, and some places are also being raided in places where agricultural implements are being manufactured
 iske chalate rambo tir banane kaa kaam dinon din thap pad rahaa hai
 Even though Yellow, White Gold and Platinum have set the stage in the market, silver has its own beauty
 chaandi ke gahane jo clasik luk dete hai, vah gold or platinum main kahaan
 
 
 The comments lekin chaandi ke gahanon ke saath ek samasya he ki vah lambe samay tak istemaal karne se yaa phir rakhane bhar se bhi kaale pad jaat hai
 So if you too are not using your beautiful silver jewelery during the wedding season simply because they have turned black, then we are telling you some remedies without much effort for it
 
 
 chaandi kii kisi bhi jewelri yaa anya saamaan ko saaf karne ke liye hameshaa sookhe or soft kapade kaa istemaal karen
 Never use substances like chemical or acid
 chaandi ke gahane ko kabhi bhi alag se polish na karaaen, isse kai baar chaandi kii protective layer chali jaati he
 Silver is a very soft metal, so it is better not to touch it with dirty hands or by wearing gloves
 namak chaandi ko saaf karne ke liye jaadui rup se kaam karata he
 Always keep silver in a clean place and if possible, keep it in butter paper or soft cloth
 chaandi ko kabhi bhi plastic main lapet kar na rakhen
 Never keep it in a very hot place
 toothpaste se chaandi kii bahut acchhee safai ho jaati he
 Apply toothpaste to your silverware and wash it with lukewarm water
 baking soda ko garm pani main milakar iskaa paste bana len, phir use kisi saaf kapade se pochh len
 This will double the hidden brightness of silver
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) But there is a problem with silver jewelery that it turns black by using or keeping it for a long time
 to agar aap bhi shaadiyon kaa mausam main apane chaandi ke sundar gahanon ko mahaj isliye yuj nahin kar par rahi hai, kyonki ve kaale pad gaye hai, to iske liye bina zyada mahanat kare ham aapako bataa rahe hai kuch upaay
 
 
 Always use dry and soft cloth to clean any silver jewelery or other items
 kabhi bhi kisi chemical yaa acid jaise padaartho kaa prayog na karen
 Never polish the silver jewelry separately, this often leads to a protective layer of silver
 chaandi bahut hi komal dhaatu he, isliye behatar hoga ki aap ise gande haathon se na chhuen yaa gloves pahanakar hi chhuen
 Salt works magically to clean silver
 chaandi ko hameshaa saaf-suthri jagah par hi rakhen or ho sake to ise butter paper yaa soft kapade main hi rakhen
 Never wrap silver in plastic
 ise kabhi bhi kisi bahut zyada garm jagah par na rakhen
 Toothpaste cleans silver very well
 apane chaandi ke saamaan par toothpaste lagaaein or use gunagune pani se dho len
 Make a paste by mixing baking soda in warm water, then wipe it with a clean cloth
 yah chaandi kii chuphi hui chamak ko doguna kar degaa

 Karnataka further argued that the tribunal has recognized the validity of these agreements in allocating part of the water to Tamil Nadu, which is incorrect
 rajya chahta he ki adaalat karnataka ko tamilnadu ko keval 132 tiemasi feet pani chhodane kii anumati de
 At the same time, Tamil Nadu denied these arguments and said that Karnataka never implemented the two agreements
 is kaaran har baar rajya ko apane adhikaar ke pani ke daawey ke liye supreme court main guhaar lagaani padati he
 The tribunal erroneously allocated 270 TMC feet of water to Karnataka, which should be reduced to 55 TMC and more water to Tamil Nadu
 vahiin centre ne kaveri prabandhan board kii sthapana or tribunel ke faisle ko lagu karne ke liye ek yojana taiyaar karne ke liye apni karrwai ko uchit tehraaya

 donon rajyon ko sinchai ke liye pani kii zarurat hoti he, isi ko lekar donon rajyon main vivaad he
 In 2007, when the dispute reached the Supreme Court, Karnataka had said that the water level of the Cauvery river has decreased due to the lack of rain, due to which it needs more water and cannot provide water to Tamil Nadu
 isi kaaran tamilnadu ne supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataya
 In 2012, the Cauvery River Authority, headed by former Prime Minister Dr
 Manmohan Singh, directed the Karnataka government to give 9,000 cusecs of water to Tamil Nadu daily, but the decision was not fully implemented

 The Karnataka government apologized for this and offered to release the water, but violent protests started there

 tippaniyan North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has made his younger sister his warlord
 khabar he ki aisa usne america or america khufia agency siie kii vajah se kiya he
 In fact, the North Korean government agency has accused the CIA of trying to kill Kim Jong-un in May this year, along with South Korea
 haalanki ye koshish naakaam ho gai magar kaatil kim jong un ke behad kareeb tak ja pahunche the
 That is why this dictator has now made his most trusted sister his warlord
 kehete hai ki maarane vaale se bada bachaane vaala hota he
 But see Kim Jong's fate, the person saving her is younger than her and the one who killed her is much bigger in strength
 lekin kab koi chota asardaar ho jaae
 And cannot be said to be ineffective
 varanaa kasar to kim ke sabase bade dushman desh america ne koi nahin chodi thi
 It has been revealed that in May this year, US intelligence agendaccia had unsuccessfully tried to kill North Korean ruler Marshall Kim Jong-un
 wo bhi bam yaa bandook se nahin balki biochemical poyzan yani aam jubaan main zehar ke zarie
 But on the one hand if the CIA is trying to kill Kim, on the other hand her sister Kim Yo Jong is trying to save her
 ye naam nayaa zarur he magar kim se iskaa rishta atoot he
 Since childhood, Kim Jong Un's favorite and now has become his protector sister Kim Yo Jong
 ab to kim ne apni bahan ko party main badi jimmedaari bhi saunp di he
 It is interesting to know whether Kim Yo Jong is her real sister or stepdaughter because Kim Jong Un's father Kim Jong In had five wives
 jinase unke kul saat bachche the
 So who is Kim Jong expressing such confidence in him and handing him such an important responsibility? kim kii ye bahan uske saath aksar field dauron par or party ke prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan dikhti he
 Obviously the relationship is close or else Kim does not trust her brothers either
 to suniye kim jong un or kim yo jong donon ek hi mata-pita kii santan hai
 And their mother's name is Ko Yong-hui
 jo pita kim jong il kii teesri patni thim
 Who died in the year 2004
 jis kim jong naamak bhai kii hatya marshall kim jong un ne malaysia main karai thi, wo kim jong in kaa sabase bada betaa tha
 
 yani kim jong un kaa sabase bada bhai
 After which Kim Jong In has a daughter named Kim Sul Sang
 jo philhal desh ke propeganda department main kaam kar rahi he
 This is followed by Kim Jong Chul who is currently playing the role of deputy chief in the Leadership Division of the Workers' Party of Korea
 magar kim jong in ke kisi bete yaa beti ne uske chauthe number ke bete kim jong un se aage nikalne kii koshish nahin kii or jisane kii wo maaraa gaya
 Among all his siblings, Kim Jong has the biggest outing on his sister Kim Yo Jong
 isiilie usne use party main paulitte beuro kaa sadsy banaaya he
 After which his position has become the eldest after his brother
 is tarakkee se pehle bhi wo apane bhai kim jong un kii chhavi sudhaarney main lagi hui thi
 And now he has been made the protector of Kim Jong Un
 yani siie ko kim jong un ko maarane se pehle kim yo jong se hokar guzaranaa hoga

 This is the second consecutive time gas prices have been raised
 isse april-sitambar 2016 ke baad gas kii dar ucchtam str par pahunch gai he
 At that time, the same price was paid to domestic producers
 gas keemat main vruddhi se aayal and natural gas corporation (oengisi) or reliance industries jaisi utpaadak companiyon kii aay main badhotaree hogi
 Also, it will be expensive to reach LPG through CNG and pipes
 iskaa kaaran isamen prakritik gas kaa upyog kachche maal ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 This will also increase the cost of urea and electricity generation

 yah lagaataar doosraa mauka he jab gas ke daam badaye gaye hai
 This has led to the highest gas rate since april-september 2016

 The increase in the gas price will increase the income of producing companies like Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Reliance Industries

 The reason for this is that natural gas is used as a raw material

 The BJP wants to increase its membership to 9 crore through this membership drive
 shyama prasad mukherjee kii jayanti par bijepi mega sadsyta abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karne ja rahi he
 The entire top leadership of the BJP will come out in this ambitious campaign that Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was strongly opposed to the grant of separate statehood status to Jammu and Kashmir

 bisisiai ne maujuuda ipel sijan se apane cricketron ko jald bulaane ke srilanka cricket ke faisle ko anuchit qaraar diya he
 The board also said that it was in talks with SLC to resolve the issue
 bisisiai upaadhyaksh rajeev shukla ne kaha, hamaare mutabik srilanka ke khilaadiyon ko 21 may tak yahaan ruknaa tha, jaisaa ki unhone vaada kiya tha or frenchygiyon ko bhi aisa hi lag rahaa tha
 But now they want to leave early and it is not fair
 unhone kaha, ab tak koi faisla nahin hua he
 The BCCI is in touch with the Sri Lankan Board and negotiations are going on between the two boards
 yah sara sankat us samay shuru hua, jab srilanka ne ipel main khel rahe apane cricketron ko nirdesh diya ki vah england daure kii taiyaari ke liye 5 may tak swadesh laut aaen
 The crisis escalated when the government and Sri Lankan cricket turned down bcci's request that the Sri Lankan star players be allowed to play in the IPL by 15 May
 is kadam se haalanki donon board ke rishton main khatas aa sakati he
 Around 11 Sri Lankan cricketers including Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene, Lasith Malinga and newly appointed captain Tillakaratne Dilshan are playing for various franchises in the IPL
 reporton ke mutabik agar srilanka ke khilaadiyon ko jald lautne ke liye baadhya kiya jaataa he, to bisisiai bhi frenchygiyon ko khilaadiyon kaa vetan or eselsi ko khilaadiyon kii kamai kaa 10 pratishat hisse kaa bhugtan rokane ko kah saktaa he
 Shukla, however, refused to confirm any such move by the BCCI
 fasebuk ke swaamitv vaali instent miseging ap company whatsap ke ko-founder bryan acton ne ek twit kiya he jo trend kar rahaa he
 He has said in his tweet that the time has come to delete Facebook
 jaahir he whatsap ko kaaphi pehle hi fasebuk ne adhigrahan kar liya tha or ab whatsap fasebuk kaa hi hissaa he
 In such a situation, if the co-founder of whatsapp says to delete Facebook, then people will raise questions on Facebook
 sawaal ye he ki aakhir whatsap ko founder ne aisa kyon kaha? twit main sirf unhone ek line hi likhaa he jisamen fasebuk delit karne kii baat he
 Apart from this, he has not written anything about it, nor has any reason been given as to why Facebook should be deleted
 is sawaal kaa jawaab fasebuk data li he
 That's why Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg got 6 in just one day
 06 billian dollar ganvaane bhi pade hai
 The data leak is related to a Cambridge Analytica firm that allegedly influenced the US President Election 2016 by tampering with the data of millions of Facebook users
 is maamle kii jaanch ke liye fasebuk ne ek digital forensik agency ko hair kiya he
 Facebook shares have fallen 10 per cent since the data leaks were reported and this has caused a significant loss to Facebook's shareholders, including Zuckerberg
 gauratlab he ki 2014 main soshal media diggaj fasebuk ne whatsap ko 19 million dollar main kharid liya tha
 Two people who created whatsapp are Brian Acton and Jane Kum
 iname se ek jine kum adhigrahan ke baad bhi whatsap ke saath rahe yani ab wo fasebuk ke liye kaam karte hai, jabaki bryan acton ne isi saal shuruyaat main apane ek foundation kii shuruyaat kii he or iske liye unhone fasebuk chhod diya he
 The reason behind this may also be that Brian has invested $ 50 million in whatsapp's rival instant messaging app Signal last month
 ek tathy ye he ki 2009 main jab bryan acton ne fasebuk main job ke liye aavedan kiya tha to unhen riject kar diya gaya tha
 He then tweeted a tweet
 isamen likhaa he, ‘fasebuk ne mujhe riject kar diya he
 It was a good opportunity to connect with the best people
 jindagi ke alge adventure ke liye taiyaar hum’fasebuk data li : ye he puraa maamla jisase fasebuk sawaalon main he twitor par dilit fasebuk trend kar rahaa hekhabar ai he ki polytical data analitics form cambridge analitica ne 2016 america president ellection ke vakt 50 million yugers kaa data hack karke usase chhedchhad kii thi
 Now the impact of data breech is also visible on the net worth of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg
 somvaar ko soshal media website fasebuk kaa share7 fisadi tak ludhak gaya
 The reason for this is the report which said that Donald Trump's campaign consultant firm Cambridge Analytica has tampered with the data of 50 million users of Facebook to influence the American President Election
 da gardian kii report ke mutabik somvaar ko america senetter ron viden ne mark jakarberg ko ek list di he jisamen fasebuk data brich se jude kai sawaal hai jinke jawaab 13 april tak maange gaye hai
 Facebook has hired digital forensic firm Stroz Freedberg to investigate the case, which will audit Cambridge Analytica
 iske liye cambridge analitica ne hami bhari kii he wo is jaanch main puri tarah sahyog karegi or wo data kii jaanch ke liye apane sarwar kaa acces degi

 Mehta denied the allegations after the charges were dropped, saying, "the facts were misrepresented and i was shown wrong
" maine sharaab nahin pi thi or meri sari test report negative ai hai
 There is nothing in it to show that i was drunk
 main adaalat kaa abhaari hum ki usne un sabooton ko sweekaar nahin kiya jinhen saamne rakhaa gaya tha

 lekin uttar pashchim dilli seat par abhi pratyaashee kii ghoshnaa nahin kii gai he, or is seat se maujuuda bijepi saansad udit raaj ke tikat ko lekar sanshay barkaraar he
 Fearing to cut his ticket, Udit Raj asked his party to end the doubts about his candidature
 haalanki, udit ne saaf kar diya he ki vah aaj namakan karenge
 If the party does not give him a ticket, he will say goodbye to the BJP
 i am waiting for ticket if not given to me i will do good bye to party— Chowkidar Dr
 Udit Raj, MP (@dr_uditraj) April 23, 2019 From officer to MP, Udit Raj's political life merging his Indian Justice Party with BJP has been quite interesting
 uttar pradesh ke ramnagar main janme udit raaj ne elahabaad uniwarsity or dilli sthiti jawaharlal uniwarsity se padhai puri kii he
 Udit Raj, who has been active in the rights of the Scheduled Caste and Tribe community, has been vocal since the college
 khatic jati se taalluk rakhane vaale udit raaj 1988 main bhartiya rajasav seva ke liye chune gaye or dilli main iskar vibhaag main upayukta, sanyukt or atirikt upayukta ke padon par apni sevaayen deen
 In 2001, Udit Raj, a critic of Hinduism's caste system, accepted Buddhism
 apni raajnneetik soch ko moort rup dene ke liye 24 november 2003 ko sarkari naukari se istipha dekar unhone indian justise party kaa gathan kiya tha
 What will he do now? It is also said that he wanted to join the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), but this could not be possible, after which he remained active about the Indian Justice Party
 vah essi / asti sanghathanon ke akhil bhartiya parisangh ke rashtriya adhyaksh bhi hai
 Even when he was joining BJP, questions were also raised that how long will the anti-rss rajta Udit Raj last? Parties like the party have announced their candidates
 namakan kii aaj antim taarikh he
 Will he contest as an independent candidate? Ashok Das, editor of Dalit Dastak magazine, says Udit Raj has done a better job
 vah achche saansad ke taur par jane bhi jate hai
 Hopefully they get a ticket again
 agar unhen tikat nahin miltaa he to vah sambhawatah parisangh kii taraf laut jaaen or apane samaaj ke liye kaam karen

 ab shikaayat ke baad phir se yah prakriya atak gai he
 People spend ten to ten years for a clerical exam
 20 janvari ko dainik bhaskar ne jo likhaa he use jaanakar aap sann rah jaaenge
 It is therefore important that now the courts as well as the courts should be knocked that the hearing of the jobs case is in the fast track court
 dainik bhaskar ke sikar sanskaran main khabar chhapi he ki rajasthan main 77, 413 padon kii bhartiyon court main ataki hui he
 Of these, appointments for 61,800 posts are of Congress tenure and 15,613 are for the tenure of the BJP government
 2013 main vidhyalay sahaayak ke liye 33,000 bhartiyon nikaali gayi thim
 But till 2018, nothing is known about them
 kya ye koi pattern he, har rajya main ek hi pattern kaise ho saktaa he
 If there is no recruitment for 33,000 posts, then it will have an impact on the state's capacity
 naujavaanon kii umr or kshamta par to asar padataa hoga
 Thankfully, the issue of unemployment does not figure in India's politics
 yuvaaon kii bhoomika ko lekar ham media vaale or netaa kuch zyaada hi badha chadha kar kehete hai ki yuva desh badal rahaa he
 He cannot change his situation, what will the country change
 pehle teen saal main bie ho jaae, jaldi naukari le le yahi bahut he
 BA will be done in six years, if it becomes a clerk in ten years, it is not the country, the country's leaders are changing it according to their own
 yah series yah bhi bataati he ki hamaare yuvaaon kii polytical quality kisi he
 We told you that in Uttarakhand, the Horticulture Department withdraws the recruitment in 2016, but after January 2018 has passed, the recruitment remains filled
 pataa nahin kab hogi
 When the youth went to meet the minister, realizing that the minister would be scared of the unemployed, the minister said what is the truth
 vaise wo baat to buree he lekin wo buree baat berojgaaron ko sochna chahie ki aaj kii raajnneeti main unki kya jagah he
 The minister should thank that he told the youth his rightful place
 agar yuva berojgaaron kii itani kharaab polytical quality na hoti to koi mantri unhen is tarah kaa lacture nahin suna saktaa tha
 The minister told them that you have not made me an MLA
 aap uttarakhand ke udyaan mantri kaa yah video suniye
 Anand will come, this is a video of 29 January
 tippaniyan Unemployed - Sir, we want to keep our word mantri - kya baat rakhni he, secetry ko karne do egzamin
 If you agitate, i will not listen
 jake mukhyamantri ko bol do isko hataa den Unemployed - Sir, listen to it
 ham apni baat rakhana chaahate hai Minister - What to keep aaj main akhbaar main pard rahaa hum, photo dekh rahaa hum, chap rahi he
 Keep opposing, keep doing mujhe tumne nahin banaaya vidhayak
 Unemployed - Sir we are twelve thousand unemployed mater
 mantri - baarah chodo, bees hazaar ho jaao
 Get it done by agitating
 main nahin sununga
 You make a movement
 mantri aisa hona chahie
 Do not be afraid of the Chief Minister as well as the unemployed youth
 ummid he in mantri ji kaa apana pradarshan shandaar hoga or log baag kaaphi khush honge inke kaam se
 Is this a pattern, how can the same pattern happen in every state
 33,000 padon par bhartee na nikle to uskaa rajya kii kshamta par koi asar to padataa hoga
 The age and capacity of the youth will be affected
 ganimat he ki bharat kii raajnneeti main berojgaare kaa mudda nahin chalata he
 We media leaders and politicians exaggerate a lot about the role of the youth and say that the young nation is changing
 vah apane halaat ko to badal nahin saktaa, desh kya badalegaa
 In the first three years, BA, it is enough to take a job quickly
 chah saal main bie karegaa, das saal main clerk banegaa to vah desh nahin, desh ke netaa use apane hisaab se badal rahe hai
 This series also describes how the political quality of our youth is
 hamane aapako bataaya tha ki uttarakhand main 2016 main udyaan vibhaag bhartee nikaalata he magar 2018 janvari biit jane ke baad bhi bhartee kaa bharta bana hua he
 Don't know when yuva jab apane aapako yah samaj kar mantri se milane gaye ki mantri berojgaaron se khauf kha jaaenge to mantri ne vahi kaha jo sachai he
 Though that thing is bad, but that bad thing the unemployed should think what is their place in today's politics
 mantri kaa shukriya adaa karnaa chahie ki unhone yuvaaon ko unki sahi jagah bataa di
 If the young unemployed did not have such poor political quality, no minister could have heard such a lecture
 mantri ji ne inhen kaha ki mujhe tumne vidhayak nahin banaaya he
 Listen to this video of Uttarakhand's Horticulture Minister
 anand aa jayega, 29 janvari kaa yah video he
 The comments berojgaar - sar, ham apni baat rakhana chaahate hai Minister - what to keep, let the secretary do the examinations
 tum andolan karoge to main baat nahin maanoonga
 Go tell the chief minister and remove it berojgaar - sar baat to sunen
 We want to keep our point mantri - baat kya rakhni he
 Today i am reading in the newspaper, looking at photos, printing
 karte raho virodh, karte raho
 You did not make me an MLA
 berojgaar - sar ham baarah hazaar berojgaaron kaa matter he
 Minister - leave twelve, be twenty thousand
 tum andolan karke karvaa lo
 i do not listen
 tum andolan kar lo
 The minister should be so
 mukhyamantri se bhi na dare or berojgaar yuvaaon se bhi na
 Hopefully, these ministers will have a great performance and people will be very happy with their work
 pehle teen saal main bie ho jaae, jaldi naukari le le yahi bahut he
 BA will be done in six years, if it becomes a clerk in ten years, it is not the country, the country's leaders are changing it according to their own

 Dhoni may retire from Test cricket in 2013 The reputation of the Indian team and its batsmen is at stake and in such a way, the pace of Waka will be a thorn for them
 shrinkhalaa main ab tak bhartiya ballebaaji taash ke patton kii tarah dhahati rahi tathaa australia ke anubhavheen lekin anushaasit gendbaaji ke akraman ke saamne uske diggaj ballebaaj jujhate rahe hai
 The only fast bowler in Perth is not guaranteed to win: Michael Clarke Now that the Indian batsmen will have to do something special on the world's fastest pitch to save themselves and the team's reputation while the team is facing the threat of England's condition
 bharat kaa koi bhi ballebaaj abhi tak shrinkhalaa main shatak nahin jad paaya he
 Indians break fast in adverse conditions: Brad Haddin, including Sachin Tendulkar, whose wait for the 100th international century is increasing
 tendulkar ne ab tak chaaron pariyon main acchhee shuruyaat kii or vah 56
 He has been successful in scoring 226 runs at an average of 50 but the other top-order batsmen have averaged less than 30

 Gautam Gambhir has not reached 100 despite scoring 83 in Sydney
 lakshmana ne bhi ek pari main 66 ran banaaye lekin vah abhi tak daure main keval 71 ran bana paye hai
 In England too, India had to face 0-4 defeat due to the collective failure of the batsmen
 vahaan dravid chal rahe the lekin yahaan unka balla ab tak khamosh rahaa he
 Yeh Kaisa Anger: Now Ishant showed 'finger' India played the first match on this ground in 1977 and scored two innings 402 and 394
 yahaan tak ki pehali pari main usne badhat hasil kii thi
 The next match between these two teams in Waka was played in 1992, in which 17-year-old Sachin Tendulkar played a brilliant innings of 114 runs
 team india par australian media kaa vaccb tak sunil gavaskar, mohinder amarnath or tendulkar ne vaaka par shatak jamaaye or bhartiya ballebaaj nishchit taur par inase prerana lenaa chahenge
 While the batsmen will have to play long innings, the bowlers will also not have to give the Australian batsmen a chance to recover from the pressure
 pehle donon match main australian team sankat se baahar nikalne main safal rahi thi
 Australia did not have a good start in both Test matches
 melbern main usne 214 ran par chah wicket ganvaa diye the jiske baad puchhlle ballebaajon ne use bachaaya
 Even in the second innings, his score was 27 runs for four wickets at one time
 sidney main ekmaatr pari main vah teen wicket par 37 ran se ubarkar vishaal score khadaa karne main safal rahaa tha
 On all these occasions, Australia was recalled by its experienced trinity Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke and Mike Hussey

 Even in batting, it does not seem that Rohit Sharma will get a chance to make his Test debut in place of Virat Kohli
 dilli ke yuva ballebaaj ne ab tak chaar pariyon main 43 ran banaaye hai
 Senior batsman Laxman is also safe despite being targeted by critics
 australian bhi abhi tak tay nahin kar paye hai ki chotil james patinson kii jagah reyaan haris legaa yaa mishael stark

 Virat Kohli is the most senior player of the Indian cricket team
 unki captaini main kai nae khilaadi team india main shaamil ho rahe hai
 Which follows captain Virat Kohli
 viraat kohli ne ek baar bataaya tha ki jab wo dressing room main sachin tendulkar se pehali baar mili the to wo kitna nervas the
 Whenever a new player comes into the dressing room, he feels the same
 viraat kohli unako comfortable karne ke liye khaas cheez karte hai
 He made this disclosure in an interview
 unhone kaha- 'main dressing room main senior rahane kii koshish nahin karata
 Virat Kohli told what youngsters do when they come to the dressing room to make them comfortable
 jisase wo khulkar apni baat sabhi ke saamne rakhte hai
 Virat said- 'I do not behave like a senior
 main us vakt bhi aisa feel nahin karata jab mujhe zyada rispect di jaati he
 i do not consider myself a senior cricketer
 jab koi mere paas aata he or jarurat se zyada rispect dene lagata he to main usee vakt majaak kar detaa hum or kehane kii koshish karata hum ki itnaa bhi syrius hone kii jarurat nahin he
 i make them comfortable at the same time
 main samajhataa hum ki insaan ko apni baat khulkar rakhni chahie
 Virat Kohli also narrated the story of his childhood, he said- 'I wanted to be with my brother and his friends as a child
 meraa bada bhai mujhase 7 saal bada he
 In such a situation, he and his friends did not keep it with them
 lekin mujhe wo log zyada kool lagate the
 Whenever i used to play cricket with him, i used to send him home during batting
 mere saath us vakt bahut ninsaphi hui
 My brother later joined hands with his father in business
 jab bhi meraa match hota tha to wo mujhe le jaataa tha or match ke baad ghar laata tha
 He worked very hard for me
 ' Chhindwara Lok Sabha seat of Madhya Pradesh is one of the high profile Lok Sabha seats in the country, which is the eye of the whole country
 is baar chhindwara se pita-putr, donon chunaav ladane ja rahe hai
 In fact, this time Congress has nominated Kamal Nath's son Nakulnath from Chhindwara Lok Sabha seat while father Kamal Nath has been given the ticket for Madhya Pradesh Assembly by-election from this Chhindwara seat
 aagaamee 29 april ko pita kamalnath or bete nakulanath donon kii kismat iviem main kaid ho jaaegi
 This is the beginning of the political innings of 44-year-old Nakulnath and he is also an MP from the same Chhindwara from where his father Kamal Nath has been around for 40 years
 chhindwara loksabhaa sansadeey seat se tikat milane ke baad nakulanath ne 'ajtak' ne exclusive baatcheet main apane pita kamalnath ko apana adarsh bataaya
 Here is an excerpt from the conversation of 'aaj Tak' correspondent Ravish Pal Singh with Nakulnath: For 40 years your father is an MP from Chhindwara
 You are going to start your political innings
 How big is the challenge before you? 
 kyonki jab meri baat hoti he to meri tulana kamalnath ji se hoti he jo bahut badi chunauti he
 Because he has developed Chhindwara a lot because he has 40 years of experience whereas i have only 40 days
 sawaal: chhindwara kii janata aapke pita ko 40 saalon se dekh rahi he, lekin nakulanath bataur ek indiviual yahaan kii janata se kaise conect karenge?nakulanath: mujhe apana parichay dene kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin thi
 i have been continuously working and campaigning here for the last 20 years, so i am not a new face for Chhindwara
 mujhe chhindwara kii janata se pyaar or aashirwad hameshaa mila he or puri ummid he ki is baar bhi milegaa
 Question: What will be your priority for Chhindwara? Nakulnath: My first priority will be employment because our youth is most worried today
 modi ji ne baat kahi thi 2 karod logon ko rojgaar denge har saal lekin aisa kuch nahin hua
 Modi ji gave the slogan of Skill India 4 years ago
 chhindwara main skill deveopment centre 15 saal pehle se chal rahe hai
 Question: In 2014, it was said to put 15 lakh rupees in the account
 2019 main congress kah rahi he 72 hajaar saal ke khate main daalane kii
 So what was the need to walk on the same line? Nakulnath: Modi ji said about 15 lakh rupees
 ham hajaar kii baat kar rahe hai
 Can you tell me 15 lakhs is possible or 72 thousand? Question: Was it pre-decided or sudden to enter politics? Nakulnath: When i came to Chhindwara after the assembly elections, the Congress workers here demanded that i go from here to Lok Sabha To contest phir maine is bare main kamalnath ji se charchaa kii or uske baad raajnneeti main aane kaa faisla kiya
 Question: Who is your biggest idol? Nakulnath: My father
 kyonki aapke saamne he badalata-badhata chhindwara or isiilie vah mere idal hai
 Question: Why should the people of Chhindwara vote for Nakulnath? Nakulnath: Because i am a youth
 yahaan 65 fisadi voter 18 se 35 saal kii umr ke bich ke hai yani ki vah noujvaan he or meri soch unase milti he
 Question: After you get the ticket, once again Congress is facing allegations of dynasty? Nakulnath: You believe that we are in democracy? So let the public decide
 mujhe yah samaj main nahin aata bijepi ke pet main kyon dard hota he
 The people will decide and leave it to the people and with what mouth does BJP talk of dynasty? His Rajasthan Chief Minister's sons are mps
 His Home Minister's son MLA raises the question of dynasty? Question: Campaigning for himself in such a hot summer
 aise main apane aap ko durust kaise rakhenge? aapako khaane main kya pasand he?nakulanath: main abhi tak kamalnath ji ke liye prachaar karata tha
 If i am campaigning for myself at this speed, then i do not see any special difference and as far as food is concerned, i like potato parathas
 sawaal: raajnneeti main aane se pehle aapke pita ne aapako kya sikh di?nakulanath: unhone ek sikh di thi ki kabhi jhooth nahin bolnaa or agar koi vaada kiya to use puraa jarur karnaa

 Nobody seems to understand why 11 such pipes have come out
 khabar ke saath lage photo main dekh sakate hai ki kis tarah se ghar ke baahar 11 pipe nikle hue hai
 Out of these 11 pipes, 7 pipes are bent while 4 are straight
 andhvishwaas main jakadaaa hua tha parivaaradarasal, bhaatia parivaar ke ghar main lage in pipon ko maut se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 Because there are a total of 11 pipes in the house which are not installed for any use
 pipe ko dekhakar saaf hota he ki parivaar ko andhvishwaas jakadaaa hua tha
 Because the number of dead in the house is 11, and pipes are also 11
 iske alaava marane waalon main 7 mahilaayein or 4 purush hai
 While 7 of the 11 pipes in the wall of the house are bent and 4 are straight

 Shockingly, Burari's family chose death in exactly the same manner as was already recorded in the register
 register main likhaa tha ki koun kahaan latakegaa or thik aisa hi kiya bhi gaya
 According to the incident, the head of the family, Narayani Devi, was found lying in a separate room

 Is death the path to salvation? The first entry in the register is in November 2017 while the last entry is on June 25
 register main likhaa tha- sabhi ichchhaaon kii purti ho
 The way things are written on the pages of the register, it seems that either this whole action was done to fulfill any desire, or the reason behind the giving of collective life is the desire for salvation
 register main bhi aisa kuch likhaa hone kii baat bataai ja rahi he
 The police is now engaged in decoding each page of the register and everything written in it
 kai ahm sawaal police kii padtaal ke centre main hai
 Like who wrote what has been written in the register, is it really written the script of the death of the family in the register, is there a mechanism behind this death, and is there any way to confuse the police
