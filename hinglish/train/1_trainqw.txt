 It is estimated that from the evening of June 15, the heat will be triggered by the amount of dust in all areas of northwest India including Delhi, this will be because storm water activity will increase in northwest India

 team india ke purv captain or apni aguwai main desh ko pehla world cap dilaane vaale cricketer kapil dev ko dar lagata he! or dar is baat kaa ki team india is baar bhi tii-20 world cap nahin jeet paaegi
 When Kapil was asked what is the chance of Team India in the T20 World Cup, his reply was, 'I am scared
 ' haalanki unhen lagata he ki shuukravaar ko pakistan ke khilaaf pehle match main team india kii jeet kii zyada sambhaavna he
 Kapil spoke on indo-pak match
 
 
 bharat ke paas pakistan ke khilaaf match jeetne kii behatar sambhaavna he
 i agree with Zaheer Abbas that Captain Cool Dhoni's return to the team will make a difference
 kapil ne kii dhoni kii jamkar tarifeek khilaadi ke taur par dhoni bahut hi shandaar hai
 If they keep their full focus and focus on the game and do not get distracted by anything else then they will prove to be dangerous for the opposing team
 tej gendbaaji sabase badi chintakapil dev ne kaha he ki tej gendbaaj team ke liye sabase badi chintaa hai
 If they do not perform, then the entire weight will fall on the spinners, which is a matter of concern
 team india ko agar jeetna he to tej gendbaajon ko acha pradarshan karnaa hi hoga
 Kapil is not happy with the opening pair of Kapil Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan
 kapil ne kaha donon aatishi ballebaaji nahin kar rahe hai
 This pair is failing, Team India needs to work on this weakness
 raina or yuvi se khush kapilkapil dev ne kaha ki suresh raina kii vaapasi dekhakar acha laga

 Principal called Aman and told him to bring his parents to school, calling it 'irresponsible' behavior
 is baat se aman kaaphi ghabara gaya
 After school, he went to his house and locked himself in the store and hanged him with a fan
 kuch der baad hi aman kii maut ho gai
 Police station in-charge of Bakshinagar, Ashwani Kumar said that the police took possession of Aman's body and sent it for postmortem
 police maamle kii chaanbin kar rahi he
 input language bharat or srilanka ke bich dharmashala main khele gaye pehle vanade match ko koi nahin bhul saktaa he
 It was the first ODI for new captain Rohit Sharma, everyone expected India to perform well
 lekin sirf ek hi ballebaaj apana dam dikhaa paaya
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni was fighting alone when the entire team was shattering like leaves
 puchhallon ke saath ballebaaji karte hue dhoni ne 65 ranon kii pari kheli or bharat ko sharmnaak score se bachaaya
 At one time it seemed that we would reach our lowest score but it could not happen under Dhoni
 haalanki, bharat kaa yah ghar main teesraa sabase kam vanade score tha
 Let us tell you that India's lowest score at home is against Sri Lanka, in 1986, 78 runs Kanpur
 apni is jimmedaari bhari pari se dhoni ne ek baar phir apane aalochakon ko jawaab diya he ki abhi unamem dam he
 This is not the first time that Dhoni has groomed the Indian team on his own and played such innings
 bhartiya phens pehle bhi aise najaare dekh chuki he
 Some examples are here
 
 
 45 note out (srilanka ke khilaaf, 2013)westeindies ke port of spain main tri siries ke final main srilanka lagbhag jeet darj kar chukaa tha
 India needed 15 runs in the last over, and had just 1 wicket in hand
 srilanka jeet ke liye aashwast tha, lekin dhoni ne pehali chaar gendon main 0,6,4,6 ran banaakar srilankai sheron ke jabade se jeet chin lee
 Dhoni returned unbeaten after scoring 45 runs
 is lo scoring match main romaanchakta kii har had paar hui
 44 not out (against Australia, 2012) Chasing Gambhir for 270, India were in a good position thanks to Gambhir's 92, but Australia remained in the match with intervening wickets
 aakhri over main bharat ko 13 ranon kii jarurat thi, or krij par dhoni ke saath aswin the
 Ashwin could only score 1 run on the first 2 balls
 baad main teesri gend par 6 or agali do gendon par 2 or 3 ran lekar dhoni ne match khatm kiya
 50 not out (against Sri Lanka, 2008) The Indian team was under constant pressure after chasing 239 runs in Adelaide, Australia
 bharat ke wicket lagaataar gir rahe the, lekin dhoni ek chor ko pakade hue the or dhire-dhire lakshya ke kareeb pahunch rahe the
 Dhoni, along with the tail batsmen, played a slow knock of 50 runs in 68 balls to give India a 2-wicket win in the last over
 dhoni ne is pari main ek bhi chaukaa yaa chhakka nahin lagaaya
 91 not out (against Bangladesh, 2007) Chasing 251 runs, half of the Indian team was sitting in the pavilion for 144 runs
 jeet mushkil thi, lekin dinesh karthik ke saath dhoni ne sangharsh nahin choda or team ko 5 wicket se jeet dilaai
 Dhoni returned unbeaten after scoring 91, while Karthik returned unbeaten after scoring 58 runs
 yahaan dhoni ne sabit kiya ki mushkil halaaton main unki ballebaaji str alag str par chali jaati he
 113 Pakistan (chennai, 2012) When Pakistan cricket team came to India in 2012, India suffered a defeat in that series
 lekin siries ke duusare vanade main dhoni ne aisi pari kheli jo itihaas main darj ho gai
 When the Indian team came out to bat first in the heat of Chennai, the score was reduced to 29 for 5 in the first 9 overs
 tab dhoni ne pehle raina, phir aswin ke saath milakar team ko sambhala or 227 tak le gaye
 Although India lost that match, Dhoni's innings was remembered by all

 in / Shikhar Dhawan's bat failed in both innings of the Kolkata Test match
 pehali pari main ve sirf 1 ran bana paae vahiin duusari pari main 17 ran banaakar ve trent bolt kii gend kaa shikaar hue
 Shikhar got an opportunity due to the injury of Lokesh Rahul before the Kolkata Test match, but the failure in both innings here has now raised a question mark on his place in Team India
 bisisiai main maujuud sutron ke mutabik ab kaaphi samay tak shikhar ko team india kii ore se ballebaazi karte nahin dekha jayega
 Team management is looking at Lokesh Rahul and Murali Vijay as the team's opening pair
 ab shikhar ko phir se gharelu cricket main lautnaa hoga or apane aap ko sabit karnaa hoga, thik vaise hi jaise ki gautam gambhir ne kiya he
 The comments gautam gambhir ko team main tisare salaami ballebaaz ke rup main chunaa gaya he or ab vahi team main shikhar kii jagah lene ke prabal jaavedaar hai
 According to sources, when Lokesh Rahul got injured, then Team India captain Virat Kohli specifically asked Gautam Gambhir to join the team
 kohli kaa maananaa he ki gotam gambhir spin gendbaazon ke khilaaf behtareen ballebaaz hai or wo bharat main aane vaale test maichon ke liye team kii ranneeti kaa ahm hissaa ban sakate hai
 Not only this, any discord between Virat Kohli and Gautam Gambhir has been denied by the BCCI officials
 duusari ore shikhar dhawan spin ke khilaaf itnaa majboot nahin he or kai baar spin gendbaazon ke shikaar bane hai
 It is not that Shikhar has not got opportunities, but he has not been able to take advantage of opportunities for the last few months
 shikhar dhawan ke kareebi logon kaa maananaa he ki is samay team india ke is openar ko maidan par apni taiyaariyon ke saath saath dimagi taur par bhi apane aap ko nikhaarana hoga
 According to sources present in the BCCI, for a long time, Shikhar will not be seen batting on behalf of Team India
 team management lokesh rahul or murali vijay ko team kii salaami jodi ke rup main dekh rahi he
 Now Shikhar will have to return to domestic cricket again and prove himself, just like Gautam Gambhir has done
 tippaniyan Gautam Gambhir has been selected as the third opener in the team and now he is in a strong position to replace Shikhar in the team
 sutron kii maane to jab lokesh rahul chotil hue to team india ke captain viraat kohli ne khaas taur par gautam gambhir ko team main shaamil karne ke liye kaha tha
 Kohli believes that Gautam Gambhir is a great batsman against spin bowlers and he can be an important part of the team's strategy for the upcoming Test matches in India
 itnaa hi nahin, viraat kohli or gautam gambhir ke bich kisi bhi manmutav kii baat ko bisisiai ke adhikariyon ne sire se nakaar diya he
 On the other hand Shikhar Dhawan is not so strong against spin and many times spin bowlers have fallen victim to it
 aisa nahin ki shikhar ko maukey nahin mili hai, lekin pichley kuch maheenon se wo maukon kaa phayda nahin uthaa paae hai
 Those close to Shikhar Dhawan believe that this opener of Team India will have to refine itself mentally along with its preparations on the field

 This day is special in the pages of history, because on this day, the creator of the Constitution, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, along with his 3,80,000 companions, converted to Hinduism and converted to Buddhism
 1950 ke dashak main hi baba sahib buddha dharm ke prati aakarshith hue or buddha sammelan main bhaag lene srilanka (tab ceylone) gaye
 On October 14, 1956, he embraced Buddhism in Nagpur with his millions of supporters
 is maukey par unhone jo 22 pratigyaaen leen usase hindu dharm or uski puja paddati ko unhone purna rup se tyaag diya
 Millions of Dalits along with Dr
 Ambedkar embraced Buddhism and this was the biggest religious conversion in the whole world
 haalanki khud unhone ise dharm parivartan nahin balki dharm-janit shaareerik, maansik va aarthik daastaa se mukti bataaya
 Ambedkar was born into the Mahar caste considered untouchable and inferior in the Hindu caste
 unhone hindu dharm main vyaapt chhot pratha ko khatm karne ke liye na sirf saamaajik balki kanoonee rasta bhi akhriyaar kiya
 He believed that only by changing the law, change of heart and mind is possible
 unke buddha dharm apnaane ke peeche buddha dharm main chuaachhut or jati pratha jaisi kuriti kaa na hona tha
 i am born a Hindu, but the Hindus will not die Ambedkar, with the strength with which the Dalits were engaged in uniting them and empowering them politically-socially, with the same strength, their opponents also insisted to stop them
 Was applying lambey sangharsh ke baad jab ambedkar ko bharosa ho gaya ki ve hindu dharm se jatipratha or chuaa-chhot kii kureetiyaan dur nahin kar paa rahe to unhone wo aitihaasik vaktavy diya jisamen unhone kaha ki main hindu paidaa to hua hum, lekin hindu maruunga nahin
 Opposition on Hindu code bill: Dr
 Ambedkar became law minister in Pandit Nehru's cabinet after independence and on Nehru's initiative he prepared Hindu code bill, but he also had to face strong opposition to this bill
 khud nehru bhi tab apni party ke andar or baahar is mudde par badhate dabaav ke saamne jhukate najar aae
 Differences on the issue increased so much that Ambedkar resigned from the post of Law Minister
 haalanki baad main hindu code bill paas hua or usase hindu mahilaon kii sthiti main krantikari badlaav bhi aayaa lekin ambedkar ke bill se ye kai maamalon main lacheela tha
 22 vows to take initiation of Buddhism: -1
 main brahma, vishnu or mahesh ko kabhi ishwar nahin maanoonga or na hi main unki puja karuunga
 2
 main ram or krishna ko kabhi ishwar nahin maanoonga, or na hi main unki puja karuunga
 3
 main gauri, ganpati jaise hindu dharm ke kisi devi devtaa ko nahin maanoonga or na hi unki puja karuunga
 4
 ishwar ne kabhi avatar liya he, is par meraa vishwaas nahin
 5
 main aisa kabhi nahin maanoonga ki tathagat buddha vishnu ke avatar hai
 i consider such propaganda crazy and false
 6
 i will never perform Shraddha nor make a pinddaan
 7
 i will never conduct anything against Buddhism
 8
 i will not do any activity through the hands of Brahmins
 9
 i would hold the theory that all humans are the same

 20
 It is my absolute belief that the Dhamma of Gautama Buddha is the true Dhamma
 21
 i believe that i have been born again
 22
 i pledge that from today onwards i will conduct according to Buddha Dhamma

 The Government of Jharkhand has made complete preparations to fight the prevailing witch system in the state
 ab bacchon ko skulon main is pratha kii khamiyaan or unase ladane ke upaay sujhaaye jaaenge
 The Jharkhand Education Ministry has also completed its preparation
 class 6, 7 or 8 ke bacchon ko dian or jaadu tona jaisi saamaajik kuritiyon ke vishay main jaankaree di jaayegi
 It has already been taught in schools as a trial
 darasal, jharkhand ke gramin ilaakon main dian ke naam par har saal saikadon nirdosho ko apni jaan ganvaani padati he
 a witch practice theme has been added to the curriculum
 
 
 gauratlab he ki jharkhand ke sarkari skulon main dian, jaadu-tona or andhvishwaas par bacchon ko jaankaree di jaaegi
 This subject will be included in the regular syllabus
 darasal, sarkaar kii lagaataar koshishon ke babajood jharkhand main dian or jaadu-tona ke naam par hone vaali pratadnaaon or hatyaon kaa daur jari he
 In such a situation, in order to make people aware of this social malpractices, it has been planned to reach them from house to house through children
 shiksha or sakshartaa sachiv aradhana patnayak ke mutabik chhathvin se aathvin tak ke bacchon kii padhai main is vishay ko shaamil kiya ja rahaa he
 So that the children can go home and explain to their parents and neighbors that there is no such thing as a witch
 isliye ve abhi se bacchon ko isaki jaankaree dene lage hai
 In many schools, it is already being taught as a trial
 class teen kii book main to dian par chape akhabaaron kii khabaron ko daalaa gaya he taaki shikshak use padhakar bacchon ko isaki jaankaree de saken or bachche abhi se is kuriti ko samajhane lage hai
 After all, why are there murders? Well, once we hear the name of the witch, the rage of such a woman emerges in our mind
 jo na keval badsoorat hoti he balki uske bal bhi betaratib hote hai
 Which has long teeth and a squeaky laugh on the lips
 darasal, bachapan se hamaare jehan main isi tarah kii tasviren chhapi hai
 In the guise of this, the brokers and anti-social elements of the land in the rural areas of Jharkhand kept their personal interests simple and profited a lot
 mahaj ek maheene pehle ranchi se sate bundu ilaake main teen masuumon kii jaan dian pratha ke naam par le lee gayi thi
 Two children were also among the dead, while two others also tried to cut the throat and escaped somehow
 aisa bhi nahi he ki yah aisi iklauti ghatana he
 Recently, five people were killed in the Mandar area of ranchi and Latehar district in the name of this practice
 aisa mana jaataa he ki in sabhi hatyaon ke peeche kii vajahdayan prathan hokar jabaran jameen hathiyaane kii manshaa he
 They were confirmed during the investigation of these murders
 1200 se adhik hatyaein ho chuki he
 
 
 In the nine months from September 2015 to May of this year, 524 cases of witchcraft and torture in the name of witch have been registered, while 35 people have been murdered
 beete saadhe paanch saal ke dauraan jharkhand main dian ke aaropon main pratadna ke kareeb 3,300 maamle darj hue hai
 The tribal families have suffered the most from these incidents
 jharkhand main dian ke naam par honivali pratadnaaon or hatyaon ke aankade behad chaukaanewaale he
 After the formation of Jharkhand, more than 1200 people have been murdered in the name of witchcraft
 mritko main mahilao ke saath-saath purush or skul janevaale bachche bhi shaamil hai
 Who had nothing to do with all this
 aisa mana jaataa he ki inaki hatya sirf jameen hathiyaane kii niyat se hi kii gai he
 The lonely and old women living in rural areas and those who have valuable land are targeted by the domineering and antisocial elements of the village
 vahiin naksal ilaaka hone kii vajah se police bhi pratadna kii shikaayat milane par yahaan jane se kataraati he
 The cipher is a matter of government's action plan
 
 
 vaise sarkaar ne iske unmoolan ke liye kai or ection plan banaaye lekin nateeja sifer rahaa he
 The Government of Jharkhand gave its approval to the Witch Practices Prohibition Act 1999 on 3 July 2001 at the 17th meeting of the Cabinet
 jinamein dian ke naam par pratadit karanevaalon ko jurmaane ke saath-saath karawas kii sajaa kaa bhi praavdhaan he
 However, due to the lack of proper publicity of the social and legal systems, the period of killings in the name of the witch continues unabated in the state

 is hafte kii ek film he, jo bhopal gas traasadee darshaati he or iskaa naam he 'bhopal: e prere for rain', jise diarect kiya he ravi kumaar ne or likhaa he david brooks or ravi kumaar ne hi
 The film stars Rajpal Yadav, Tannishtha Chatterjee, Martin Sheen, Kal Penn, Misha Barton, Joy Sen Gupta and David Brooks
 yah film 1984 kii bhopal gas traasadee kii ghatana or uske kaaran darshaati he
 Director Ravi Kumar has been very sincere about the subject and he has connected all the episodes behind this tragedy and all the actors are doing well in their place, but Kal Penn, Joy Sen Gupta and Rajpal Yadav have their own The character emerges well, but i think the director has done the research well, but he could not decide that the film was in the category of documentary Right or film, which led to the first half is quite technical and more like a documentary and comes with a reflection film after the interval
 traasadee ke baad ke seen kaaphi damdaar hai, jahaan aspataal kii majaburi, gas kaa risaav, laashon ke dher aapako jhakzor jate hai, lekin film kaa screen play or editing jhatka detii he
 The cinematography of the film is mostly kept away from tripods before the intermission
 ho saktaa he ki bastiyon kii asthir jindagi ko darshakon tak pahunchane ke liye diarector ravi kumaar ne yah nirnay liya ho, par film ke vishay ke saath yah andaaj sur nahin milaataa or darshak kaa dhyaan bhatkata he
 The character of Misha Barton goes to waste according to me
 ek or baat yah film zyaadaatar angreji main he, to behatar hota agar filmkaar isamen sabatital rakhte taaki darshakon tak isaki pahunch badhane main aasaani hoti
 If you want to get to the bottom of this tragedy, then this film is for you, but don't expect to entertain
 haa, yah film kuch hisson main aapke dil ko jarur chhu jaaegi
 i would not like to rate this film, because the Bhopal gas tragedy was a major accident in the history of India and it was not right to weigh it in the ratings
 jaaie film dekhie, aap kuch na kuch is film se jarur lekar aaenge

 The Supreme Court considered Plaintiff No
 1 to be the same Deity in 1949 that these idols were kept wrong but even after that Plaintif No
 1 decreeed the suit and gave it the land which is the land of mosque "
 faisle par apni naaraazgi bataate hue unhone kaha, "supreme court se hamaara pehla aitraaj yah he ki agar vah diity jo ho hi nahin sakati he hindu lau ke tahat, yah puri tarah legal sawaal he jisko ham supreme court ke saamne le janaa chaahate hai
 "in presenting his second argument, he said," The Supreme Court has accepted this and the High Court has also held that Muslim evidences have been used since at least 1857 to 1949 to use that mosque and to offer prayers in that mosque
 is
 takreeban isko 90 saal hote hai
 So if we have prayed Namaz in a mosque for 90 years, then it is beyond our comprehension to give the land of that mosque to the temple by not giving it to our mosque
 ham supreme court main is par bhi janaa chaahate hai"

 The nuances of Kangana's dance shocked me
 uttam singh kaa mujeec film ke kairactor ke saath jaataa he

 com The area of ramghat in Karsevakapuram, which has been silent during the last four years, is resonating these days with the sound of chisels, hammers and machine-cut stones
 ye awaajen beete 1 aktubar ko sharadiya navaratri ke pehle din se dobaaraa shuru hui kaaryshaala kaa pataa bhi bataa rahi hai
 The ownership dispute over the Ram Janmabhoomi is pending in the Supreme Court, but these most ignorant artisans are engaged in carving the stones in the Ram temple
 3 acre jameen par faili kaaryshaala main pravesh karte hi bain ore kattar mashin he jisase rajasthan main banshipahadpur ilaake se aae bedaul pattharon ko taraasha ja rahaa he
 Carving of the moulders is being done on the plinth covered with tin shed
 mirzapur se aae karigar nagar style main pattharon par chheni-hathaudi kii madad se nakkashi karne main lage hai
 Before the carving, the workshop in-charge Annu Bhai Sompura gives a design impression on the stones and the staff carves the stones accordingly
 disambar 2007 main kaaryshaala band hone se pehle yahaan kul 80 karigar kaam kar rahe the lekin ab inaki sankhya keval 16 he
 VHP spokesperson in Ayodhya, Sharad Sharma, says, "not only were the economic reasons behind the closure of the workshop, the lack of space was also responsible
 pehle andaaj tha ki 1992 main vivaadit sthal ke aasapaas nyaas kii adhigrahit 45 acre jameen waapas mil jaaegi to pattharon ko vahaan rakh diya jayega
 But in 2002 the High Court stayed it, which led to the decision to close the workshop
 ''kaaryshaala ko dobaaraa shuru karne ke peeche vihip netaaon kaa tark he ki beete varsh 30 sitambar ko jab ramajanm bhoomi se judaa hycourt kaa faisla aayaa to yah bhav jagaa ki mandir nirmaan ke liye jo intjaar he, shaayad ab vah dur ho jaae
 For this, it was decided to gradually speed up the work of temple construction
 kaaryshaala dobaaraa bhale hi shuru ho gai ho, par yahaan samasyaayein kam nahin he
 Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas and VHP, who were conducting the workshop facing shortage of funds, were accused of molesting the funds received in donations
 nyaayalay main hinduon kii ore se prativaadee swami hardayal aarope lagaate hai ki 1989-90 main bhaajapa netaa laalkrishna adwani kii rath yatra ke dauraan hindu jagriti se vihip ko 24 karod ru
 The VHP and the Trust have not accounted for it
 swami hardayal bataate hai, ''jab 1993 main bane kanoon se spasht ho gaya he ki vihip yaa nyaas ko ram mandir banane ke liye jameen nahin di jaaegi
 Also, the trust is neither the plaintiff in the court nor the defendant, in such a situation, the work of stone carving in the workshop is fooling people
 ''kaaryshaala shuru hone ke baad bhaajapa ne rajnath singh or calraj mishra kii janashakti yatra kaa samaapan sthal bhi badal diya
 Now these trips will end on November 17 in Ayodhya instead of Lucknow
 isse is baat ko bal mila ki bhaajapa bhale hi bhrashtachar yaa vikaas kii baaten kar rahi hon, lekin party ko lagata he ki jo vot bank usase chatak chukaa he, use ram janmabhumi mudda dobaaraa uthaakar hi hasil kiya ja saktaa he
 But BJP state president Surya Pratap Shahi says, "both the stone carving and the Jan Swabhiman Yatra for the construction of the temple are being done under different arrangements
 inhen ek saath jodakar nahin dekha ja saktaa
 "but Sharad Sharma says," To get Muslim votes, political parties are pushing their heels but nobody is paying attention to the serious problems of Hindu society
 bhaajapa aisa kar rahi he to isamen bura kya he?''baharhaal, ram janmabhumi vivaad par hycourt kaa faisla bhale hi kuch ho, raajnneeti ne is mudde ko jinda rakhaa he or yah prayaas abhi jari he
 Talk: Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, president of Nritya Gopal Das Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas is committed to building a grand Ram temple on Ramjanmabhoomi
 unke mutabik nyaas ko mili pai-pai kaa hisaab he
 Excerpts from the conversation with him: On the charge of money manipulation, they say? Money-for-money audit takes place
 isamen kisi prakaar kii gadabadi nahin he
 The allegations have no basis
 mandir nirmaan ke liye jaruri dhan he?dhan kii kami he
 But as soon as the construction of the temple starts, those who give money will also come
 maamla supreme court main hone se mandir nirmaan kii baat karnaa kya uchit he?mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki supreme court kaa faisla bhi hinduon ke paksh main hi aayega
 If not, what will we do? Efforts will be made to build the temple
 court ke baahar bhi maamla sulajh saktaa he
 Its efforts are also going on, but confusion arises due to the policies of the Central Government

 However, a national selector has denied this news

 lagata he, aagaamee karnataka vidhansabha chunaav ko dekhte hue goa or karnataka ke bich dashakon puraane jal bantwaare ke mudde ko nibatane kii bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah kii koshish ulti pad gai he
 On December 21, at the behest of Shah, Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar and Karnataka BJP President B
K
 es
 There was a meeting between Yeddyurappa
 isamen mahadaayi nadi se 7
 Parrikar's proposal to give 56 TMC water to Karnataka is strongly opposed by not only the voluntary organization, but also members of the Goa government with weak coalition
 yediurppa ne is kadam kii 'siyasat' samajhaaii thi ki yah atirikt pani uttari karnataka kii pyaas bujhaayega, jahaan bhaajapa may main agle vidhansabha chunaavon main badi kamyaabi kii aas main he
 In this election, the issue of water will affect the results of at least 25 seats out of the 223 seats in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly
 mahadaayi nadi karnataka se nikalati he or vahiin iskaa 78 fisadi pravaah bhi he
 In Goa it is called Mandovi, where about 43 per cent of the population depends on it for their drinking water needs
 haalanki parrikar ne daawa kiya he ki is faisle main goa ke hiton se samjhauta nahin kiya gaya he
 But his coalition's key partners, especially the Goa Forward Party (GFP) leadership, clearly disagree
 jieffpi netaa or rajya ke jal sansaadhan mantri vinod palekar kehete hai, ''mahadaayi hamaare rajya ke liye ekmaatr jal sansaadhan he
 We will not compromise the interests of the people
 '' vahiin goa ke purv mahadhivaktaa atmaram nadkarni kehete hai ki mahadaayi ko lekar or bhi zyada bhayaavah yojanaayen hai
 They say that the real issue is not the water requirement of North Karnataka but the neighboring state's plan to build eight dams on Mahadayi
 goa ke paryaavarnavidon ke sanghathan 'mahadaayi bachaao abhiyaan' ne chetavanee di he ki nadi ke pani kaa rukh modeye kii karnataka kii yojana goa ke paanch pramukh abhayaaranyon ke liye khatre kii ghanti hai
 He says that Mahadayi, Bondla, Mahaveer, Drs
 saalim ali pakshi abhayaarany or molen neshnal park sankat main pad jaaenge
 Karnataka 2002 to 7 for irrigation
 56 tiemasi pani kii maang kar rahaa he, par goa ne isse inkaar kar diya, natijatan november, 2010 main tribunel kii sthapana hui
 Now the BJP is also facing heavy opposition in Karnataka
 haalanki yediurppa ne mukhyamantri parrikar ke disambar, 2017 ke patr ko vivaad 'sulajhane' ke saboot ke rup main prasaarit kiya he, lekin hajaaron naaraaz kisaanon ne yediurppa par 'dhokhaa dene' kaa aarope lagaate hue bhaajapa ke bangaluru karyaalay ko gher liya
 Taking advantage of the opportunity, the Karnataka Congress leadership accused Parrikar and Yeddyurappa of performing before the Assembly elections in the state
 mukhyamantri siddharamaiya ne majaak udaate hue kaha ki kisaanon ne yediurppa ke jhooth ko pakad liya he
 Former Chief Minister H

 di
 Leaders of Janata Dal (secular) led by Kumaraswamy are also accusing the BJP of 'betrayal' of the farmers of the state
 aise main lag rahaa he ki vot ko dhyaan main rakhkar kiya gaya samjhaute kaa daanv ulataa pad gaya he

 Though there was no discussion about Prashant Kishore in the executive, but in the party's election policy was implemented as soon as the organization's election was announced
 jarurat hogi to 13 oktober ko chunaav karaayaa jayega
 Nitish Kumar said that the party will seek votes in these four states on the basis of the work done in Bihar
 jammu kashmir main to kaaphi majbootee se ham chunaav ladenge kyonki vahaan ke panchayat chunaav main party ne acha pradarshan karte hue panchayat ke 600 siten jiti hai
 The municipal corporation of the three districts is controlled by the party
 unhone bataaya ki party ne ghati ke 47 or jammu ke 11 siton par chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 JDU feels that due to PDP and Congress being zeroed out, people's trust in JDU will increase
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki isi tarah dilli main aam aadmi party par ab janata kaa bharosa nahin rahaa he
 BJP and Congress have seen the people there
 party ko purvanchal ke votaron par bharosa he
 He said that we are with ND in Bihar and wherever needed we continue to support BJP like it did in Nagaland
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav main mahilaon ke bade vot pratishat se kaaphi kuch samajhane kii jarurat he

 They came in an autorickshaw and parked it at the end of the road and they reached us in the middle of the water up to their knees

 uttar pradesh sarkaar dwaara rajya ke paryatak sthalon ke bare main chhapavai gai ek pustika se tajmahal ko hataa dene kaa vivaad abhi khatm bhi nahin hua tha ki bijepi ke vidhayak sangeet som ne tajmahal ko lekar ek sansanikhej bayaan dekar phir se is vivaad ko jinda kar diya
 Speaking at an event held in Meerut on Sunday, BJP MLA Sangeet Som from Sardhana in Meerut said that the Taj Mahal was built by traitors and its history is like a stain on India's culture
 sangeet som ne kaha ki jab pustika se tajmahal kaa naam hataaya gaya to bahut bavaal machaa, lekin aakhir main jaananaa chahta hum ki vah kis itihaas kii baat kar rahe hai
 Sangeet Som also said that the Taj Mahal was built by the people who committed the murder and put his father in jail
 aise logon kaa itihaas hamaara itihaas nahin ho saktaa
 The controversy erupted again after Sangeet Som's statement, with the BJP disassociating itself from the statement that it could be his personal vote and not the party's vote
 lekin aaj tak se khaas baatcheet main sangeet som apni baat par adig rahe or kaha ki tajmahal hamaari saanskrithik dharohar nahin ho hi nahin saktaa
 It is nothing more than a beautiful building and mausoleum
 som ne safai di ki unka virodh tajmahal se nahin balki use banane waalon se he
 He said that the history of Mughal kings should be taught properly
 yah bataaya janaa chahie ki vah akramanakari the
 It is necessary to tell what Babur Aurangzeb and Shah Jahan did
 unhone kitna atyaachaar kiya, yah bataanaa jaruri he
 Sangeet Som, who is always in controversy, reiterated that it is a historical fact that the Mughals built temples in Ayodhya in Kashi and in Mathura by breaking temples
 tajmahal kaa khubasurat makbara he or use dekhne ke liye agar log aate hai to isamen koi buraai nahin he
 But it must also be told the truth that the Mughals committed many atrocities and killed many people
 jab sangeet som se poocha gaya ki kya vah sampradayikta kii raajnneeti kar rahe hai to ulta unhone kaha ki darasal hua yah he ki congress ne tushtikaran karte hue ek khaas vot bank ko khush karne ke liye galat tareeke se itihaas likhvaya he
 Asaduddin Owaisi questioned Sangeet Som's statement that if the Taj Mahal was built by traitors according to Sangeet Som, the Red Fort was also built by them
 to kya pradhanmantri ko laal kile par jaakar jhanda fahraana band kar dena chahie? is bare main puche jane par sangeet som ne kaha ki "ovaisi kii kahi baton kaa main kya jawaab duun kyonki unhone to yah bhi kaha tha ki 15 minute ke liye force hataa do phir ham dikhaa sakate hai ki kya kiya ja saktaa he or unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki bhagwaan ram ayodhya main nahin, haryana main paidaa hue the
 What should be said about those who discuss dividing the society
 "som ne kaha ki unka naam dangon main ghasita gaya kyonki samaajawaadee party kii sarkaar thi lekin kuch bhi sabit nahin ho sakaa
 The SIT that was set up to investigate the case said that no evidence was found against Sangeet Som
 ham log dharm kii raajnneeti nahin karte hai, ham vikaas kii baat karte hai lekin bacchon ko jo galat itihaas padhaayaa ja rahaa he, use badalanaa jaruri he
