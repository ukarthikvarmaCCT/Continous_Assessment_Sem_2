 ashish nehra ne buudhvaar ko antarrashtriya cricket ko alavida kah diya
 At the end of the T20 match played against New Zealand at Ferozeshah Kotla, Nehra also showed some malaise and targeted the main selector for the team selection
 bharat kii taraf se lagbhag 19 saal ke kariyar main 17 test, 120 vanade or 27 tii20 match khilne vaale nehra ne kaha, 'nishchit taur par kuch malaal hai, lekin main khud ko bhaagyashaalee maanata hum ki itani adhik choton ke baavjood meraa kariyar itnaa lanbaa khinchaa
 The figures may tell a different story as i played my last Test in 2004 when i was 24-25 years old
 vahiin cricket ko alavida kahe jane ke sawaal par nehra ne kaha ki unhone sanyas ke faisle se chayansmiti ko avgat nahin karaayaa or keval team prabandhan ko isaki soochna di
 He said, 'there was no talk to the chairman of my selection committee (MSK Prasad)
 main team prabandhan ko ranchi main apane faisle ke bare main bataa diya tha
 When i spoke to Virat, he asked if i am pure
 usne suzav diya ki main ipel main khel saktaa hum
 'nehra said,' Luckily the match was in Delhi
 maine kisi tarah ke vidaai match kii maang nahin kii thi
 i did not talk to the selectors about retirement
 jab maine khelnaa shuru kiya tha to chayankartaaon ko poochkar nahin kiya tha
 He, however, said that if the World Cup had been held after six months, he would have reconsidered his decision to retire
 srilankake khilaaf farvari 1999 main test cricket ke jariye antarrashtriya cricket main padaarpan karne vaale nehra ne kaha, 'maine lagbhag 19 saal pehle padaarpan kiya tha or ab main 38 saal main sanyas le rahaa hum
 It is an emotional moment because now i will not do what i was doing for the last 19 years
 yahaan tak jo khilaadi abhi khel rahe hai ve bhi jaanate hai cricket ke baad bhi jindagi he
 They also won't always play
 ek din unhen bhi sanyas lenaa he
 Nehra's career has been fluctuating due to injuries, which he also owns
 unhone kaha, ' main ek saadhaaran insaan hum or main jahaan hum vahaan bahut khush hum
 i don't believe in statistics much
 phir bhi kuch malaal hai jaise ki choton se jujhna lekin yah sachaai he
 Even Sachin Tendulkar must have thought that i could have scored 5000 more
 'nehra ne kaha, 'mahendra singh dhoni or gairi karston 2009 main chaahate the ki main test cricket main khelun lekin maine saaf kiya pehle mujhe 2011 kaa vishwa cap khilne do or phir faisla karuunga
 Now i can share my experience among young fast bowlers
 ' is tej gendbaaj ne kaha ki vah vishwa cap 2011 ke baad vanade team main chayan nahin kiye jane ke team prabandhan ke faisle se vah naakhush nahin hai, lekin is dauraan vah acha pradarshan kar sakate the
 He said, 'I have been someone who never questions the decisions of the team management
 agar ve meraa chayan nahin karte to yah unka faisla he
 i continued to work hard because they say that one's hard work never goes wrong
 yahi khed he ki in teen chaar varshon main main desh ke liye acha pradarshan kar saktaa tha

 On these developments, BJP state president BS Yeddyurappa said that these efforts will not yield any result as the fall of the government is 'near'
 yediurppa ne yahaan patrakaron se kaha, 'congress or jad(es) main bhram he jiske kaaran vidhayak party chhod rahe hai
 a systematic conspiracy is on to bring back the mlas
 ' unhone kaha, 'maahaul arajak he or sarkaar kaa patan asann he
 Yeddyurappa claimed that the state government had lost majority
 unhone kaha ki vishwaas mat karana 'nirarthak' he
 The Supreme Court on Friday ordered the Speaker to maintain the status quo until July 16, following the resignation of 10 disgruntled mlas of the congress-jd (S) alliance, following which Kumaraswamy announced a vote of confidence in the House

 It is election season in the country
 agle saal hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav se pehle paanch rajyon main ho rahe vidhansabha chunaav ko semifinal ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 Both the Congress and the BJP do not want to leave no stone unturned to win the elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Mizoram
 in paanch rajyon main se teen main bijepi kii sarkaar he to vahiin mizoram main congress to telugana main tiares kaa shashan rahaa he
 On the one hand, while the Congress is looking for a comeback in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, the BJP is eyeing power once again in these states
 congress kii ore se jahaan rahul gandhi kaman sanbhale hue hai to vahiin bijepi kii ore se khud piem modi morcha liye hue hai
 Both the leaders are holding election rallies
 in reliyon main donon netaa ek duusare par joardaar hamalaa bhi kar rahe hai, lekin congress ke kuch netaa apane bayaan se party ke liye musiibat khadi kar dete hai, jiske bachaav main congress adhyaksh ko khud saamne aana padataa he
 On the one hand, while the leaders used to give statements on corruption, crime, development, unemployment during the elections, now the words of the leaders have reached the parents of the opponents
 congressi netaa ne piem modi ke pita ko lekar diya bayaandarasal, congress ke ek netaa ne piem modi ke pita ko lekar bayaan diya
 Former Union Minister Vilasrao Muttavar had said about PM Modi that the prime minister whose father's name is not known to anyone, Modi asks for accounts from Rahul Gandhi, while there is a Rahul Gandhi who has known about generations
 purv kendriya mantri ne kaha ki piem narendra modi jo rahul gandhi se bhid rahe hai, narendra modi ko piem banane se pehle koun jaanata tha
 Even today no one knows the name of the father of PM Narendra Modi, but does everyone know the name of the father of Rahul Gandhi, even for generations, and whose father's name is not known, they are asking for accounts from Prime Minister Modi, Rahul Gandhi
 kis baat kaa hisaab maang rahe hai
 Although Congress President Rahul Gandhi himself has never made any statement on the parents of PM Modi, but the way his leaders are making statements, they are creating trouble for him
 'piem modi ne kiya palatwaar'piem modi bhi congress ke is netaa par palatwaar karne main deree nahin kii
 Addressing a rally in Vidisha, Madhya Pradesh, he said that my father who has passed away 30 years ago, what is the reason that he is dragging my parents in it
 piem modi ne kaha ki main kisi ke parivaar ke bare main bayaan nahin detaa, lekin main purv pradhanmantri ke khilaaf bol rahaa hum
 If my parents were in politics, Congressmen had the right to speak on them
 aapako bataa den ki piem indira gandhi or rajeev gandhi kii baat kar rahe the
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi's grandmother Indira Gandhi and father Rajiv Gandhi have been former Prime Ministers of the country
 'rupaya piem modi kii maa kii umr se neeche aa pahunchaa'isse pehle congress saansad raaj babbar ne america dollar ke mukaable antarrashtriya bazaar main girte rupye se piem modi kii maa hiraben modi kii umr karai thi
 In a rally, he had said that today the rupee has come down from PM Modi's mother's age
 gandhi parivaar par piem modi kaa hamalapiem modi aksar apni reliyon main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or sonia gandhi par hamalaa bolte rahete hai
 They surround Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi about the National Herald case in rallies and say that those who have gone out on bail in crores of rupees, both mother and son are on bail, they are asking us questions about demonetization Why did it? While addressing a rally recently, PM Modi had said that four generations of nehru-gandhi have ruled this country, but during this time they only cheated the poor Has given

 The GST Council was given the authority to enact model legislation on the basis of constitutional amendment
 jahaan tak kanoon banane kii baat he to yah sangheey dhaanche ke aadhaar par hoga, vahiin sansad or rajya vidhansabhaon kii sarvocchata bani rahegi

 There was also a suggestion that it should be taxed

 However, no additional tax will be levied on consumers
 jetali ne kaha ki muaavja un rajyon ko diya jaayegaa jinhen jiesti pranali lagu hone se nuksaan ho rahaa ho

 unhone yah bhi spasht kiya ki jiesti parishad main koi bhi faisla lene main centre kaa vot keval ek tihaai he jabaki do tihaai vot rajyon ko he
 Therefore, the Center is not in favor of imposing its opinion while making any decision

 After the implementation of GST, many other taxes including Central Excise, Service Tax and Value Added Tax (VAT) in states will be included in it
 jetali ne vidheyakon ko spasht karte hue kaha ki kendriya jiesti sambandhi vidheyak ke madhyam se utpaada, seva kar or atirikt seemaa shulk samaapt ho jane kii sthiti main centre ko kar lagane kaa adhikaar hoga
 The Center will have the right to tax the movement of goods and services in the states through the integrated GST or IGST
 kar chhot ke sambandh main munaafe kamaane se rokane ke upbandh ke bare main sthiti spasht karte hue vitt mantri ne kaha ki agar 4
 5 percent tax exemption is given then it does not mean that it should be considered as private profit but also its benefit should be given to the consumers

 The Finance Minister said that like real estate, the situation was also with respect to alcohol and petroleum products
 rajyon ke saath charchaa ke baad petroleum padaarthon ko iske daayre main laayaa gaya he lekin ise abhi shunya dar ke tahat rakhaa gaya he
 This will be considered by the GST Council

 The Finance Minister said that there was no smooth flow of goods and severities in the country
 aise main jiesti pranali ko aage badhaayaa gaya
 a tax where there is an Assessing Officer
 adhiktar swa moolyankan ho or audit maamalon ko chhodkar keval simit moolyankan ho

 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Due to the money bill, these four bills had the right to be discussed only in Rajya Sabha
 loksabhaa 29 march ko in vidheyakon ko manjuuri de chuki he
 Responding to the discussion on the Goods and Services Tax Bills, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley stated the opposition's apprehensions that these bills are being compromised with the rights of Parliament in terms of taxation
 unhone kaha ki pehali baat to yah he ki isi sansad ne samvidhan main sanshodhan kar jiesti parishad ko karon kii dar kii sifarish karne kaa adhikaar diya he
 Jaitley said that the GST Council is the first federal decision making body
 samvidhan sanshodhan ke aadhaar par jiesti parishad ko model kanoon banane kaa adhikaar diya gaya
 As far as law making is concerned, it will be on the basis of federal structure, while the supremacy of Parliament and state legislatures will remain
 haalanki in siforeeshon par dhyaan rakhana hoga kyonki alag-alag rajya agar alag dar tay karenge to arajak sthiti utpann ho jaayegi
 This is a plausible explanation and should not be interpreted otherwise
 unhone kaha ki samvidhan main sanshodhan kar yah sunishchit kiya gaya he ki yah desh kaa ekmaatr aisa kar hoga jise rajya evam kendra ek saath ekatra karenge
 Clarifying the situation on objections about having multiple tax rates instead of creating a uniform tax, the Finance Minister said that there are many food products which are currently taxed at zero and no tax will be levied even after the GST system is implemented
 kai chijen aisi hoti hai jin par ek samaan dar se kar nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 For example, rates of tobacco, alcohol, etc
 are high, while the normal rate on clothes
 jetali ne kaha ki jiesti parishad main charchaa ke dauraan yah tay hua ki aarambh main kai kar lagaana zyada saral hoga
 The Finance Minister said that the GST Council has fixed rates of 0, 5, 12, 18 and 28 percent in the GST regime after discussions
 lakjri kaaron, bottle band vaatit peyon, tambaakoo utpaada jaisi ahitkar vastuon evam koyala jaisi paryaavaran se judi saamagree par iske upar atirikt upkar bhi lagane kii baat kahi he
 He said that the cess levied by more than 28 percent will go to the Compensation Fund and the states which are suffering losses will be given out of it
 aisa bhi suzav aayaa ki ise kar ke rup main lagaaya jaae
 But imposition of tax would have affected consumers
 baharhaal, upabhoktaaon par atirikt kar nahin lagaaya jaayegaa
 Jaitley said that compensation will be given to those states which are suffering losses due to the implementation of GST system
 yah aarambh ke paanch varshon ke liye hoga
 He said that there was no consensus on GST during the Congress-led UPA government because there was no offer for compensation to the disadvantaged states
 jiesti main muaavje kaa praavdhaan deal karne main sahaayak’ hua or rajya saath aae
 Giving clarification on the objection of many members to the real estate sector not being included in the GST, the Finance Minister said that this is an area in which states get a lot of revenue
 isamen registry tathaa anya shulkon se rajyon kii aay hoti he isliye rajyon kii raay ke aadhaar par ise jiesti main shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 He also clarified that in taking any decision in the GST Council, the vote of the Center is only one-third while the states have two-third vote
 isliye koi bhi faisla karte samay centre apni raay thopane ke paksh main nahin he
 Terming the Goods and Services Tax as the first federal contract to be constitutionally approved, Jaitley said that it would pave the way for imposing a system of 'one nation, one tax' in the country through GST while not imposing additional tax burden on consumers
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki jiesti parishad kar dhaanche ko sarvasammati se tay kar rahi he or is bare main ab tak 12 baithken ho chuki hai
 The bill is based on the principle of shared sovereignty between the central and state governments and is the first such initiative
 jiesti ke lagu hone par kendriya str par lagane vaale utpaada shulk, sevakar or rajyon main lagane vaale mulya vardhit kar (waite) sahit kai anya kar isamen samahit ho jaayenge
 Jaitley clarified the bills and said that through the Central GST Bill, the Center will have the right to levy tax in the event of excise, service tax and additional customs duty
 samanvit jiesti yaa ijiasti ke jariye vastu or sevaaon kii rajyon main awajahi par centre ko kar lagane kaa adhikaar hoga
 While clarifying the situation regarding the provision to stop earning profits in relation to tax exemption, the Finance Minister said that if 4
 5 pratishat kar chhot di jaati he tab iskaa arth yah nahin ki use nijee munafa mana jaae balki iskaa laabh upabhoktaaon ko bhi diya jaae
 This is the meaning of this provision
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki real estate kii tarah hi sthiti sharaab or petroleum utpaadon ke sambandh main bhi thi
 Petroleum products have been brought under its purview after discussions with the states but it has been kept under zero rate for now
 is par jiesti parishad vichaar karegi
 Alcohol is still outside its scope
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki pehle ek vyakti ko vyavsaay ke liye kai moolyankan agenciyon ke paas janaa padataa tha
 In order to carry on economic activities, one had to undergo excise, service tax, state VAT, Manaranjan tax, entry fee, luxury tax and many other taxes
 vitt mantri kaha ki vastuon or severa kaa dersh m sugam pravaah nahin tha
 In such a situation, the GST system was pushed forward
 ek aisa kar jahaan ek moolyankan adhikari ho
 Mostly self assessment and only limited evaluation except in audit cases
 jetali ne kaha ki kar ke upar kar lagata he jisase mudrasphiti kii pravriti badhati he
 Hence the idea of making the whole country a market
 yah baat ai ki saral vyavastha desh ke andar laai jaae
 Stating that bringing agriculture under the purview of GST, the Finance Minister said that agriculture and farmers do not require registration
 dhara 23 ke tahat krishak evam krishi ko chhot mili hui he
 It is therefore placed in the definition to explain this exemption
 is bare main koi bhram nahin hona chahie
 Jaitley said that there should be no confusion about when agricultural products are zero-rate
 tippaniyan Rejecting the objections of the Congress in this regard, Jaitley said that 29 states, two union territories and the center had considered this, which included eight finance ministers of the Congress-ruled state
 tab kya in sabhi ne milakar ek khaas varg ke khilaaf sajeesh kii?’’ jiesti lagu hone ke baad vastu evam jins kii keemton main vruddhi kii ashankaon ko khaarij karte hue vitt mantri ne kaha ki kar kii dar vartmaan str par rakhi jaayegi taaki iskaa mudrasphiti sambandhi prabhaav nahin pade
 Jaitley said that Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly will bring a legislation regarding GST
 unhone kaha ki jammu kashmir ke vitt mantri ne jiesti parishad kii sabhi baithkon ne bhaag liya he
 The Upper House rejected the amendment of Derek o'brien of the Trinamool Congress stating that all decisions of the GST Council should be approved by the Parliament

 J&K was neither a party to the partition of our country nor did we support division on religious lines
 We as a state opted for the opposite but unfortunately are still paying the price

 The train has always been running late, so why should we stop asking the question why the train is running late? is vakt to kuhasaa bhi nahin he na hi teej tyoharon ke kaaran special train kii sankhya badi he, phir bhi kai trainen bees se tees ghante kii deree se kyon chal rahi hai
 Is there any cost for the time of passengers traveling on these trains? media ke lihaaz se sochie
 Someday, twenty airplanes fly four to ten hours late, on that day there is a storm on the channels
 haahaakaar much jaataa, magar aisa kyon he or kab tak aisa rahegaa ki rail gaadi der se chale or ham sawaal na karen
 Millions of people get annoyed every day due to this delay and then return to normal
 unke kaam se lekar paise kaa jo nuksaan hota he uski bharpai koi nahin karata
 We talked about the Freedom Fighter Express
 ek chook ho gai
 Earlier it was told that this train runs from Jai Nagar in Bihar to Anand Vihar but not Anand Vihar, it runs from New Delhi and goes to Jayanagar
 swatantraaa senaniyon ke naam par chal rahi is train kii to kam se kam aisi pahchaan honi chahie thi ki saamaanya taur se yah samay se chale
 The 12561 Freedom Fighter Express was scheduled to leave from Jaynagar for Delhi at 2 pm on May 2
 magar yah train jayanagar se khulti he teen may kii subah 2 bajkar 20 minute par yani 12 ghante let
 It was supposed to arrive at New Delhi Railway Station at 3
30 pm on May 3, but it did not arrive until the program started
 2 may ko dilli se jayanagar kii ore jane vaali train number 12562 ke ravaanaa hone kaa samay tha shaam 8 bajkar 40 minute
 It is being known from the website that this train will open at 9:30 pm on May 3, not on May 2, ie 24 hours late
 2 may kii train teen may ko khul rahi he or teen may kii train chaar may ko khulegi
 Our colleague Pramod Gupta went to Darbhanga station at 5:30 pm on 3 May
 vahaan pataa chalaa ki dilli se darbhanga aane vaali 12561 number kii swatantraaa senaanee express 24 ghante let he
 The same train has to go back from Jayanagar to Delhi
 us vakt bataaya gaya ki ab yah train dopaher teen baje ke bajaay subah ke teen baje jaaegi yani 12 ghante kii deree se khulegi
 Our colleague Pramod Gupta has sent a video
 dilli se chalakar darbhanga aane vaali swatantraaa senaanee express stesan main pravesh kar rahi he
 This train was supposed to come to Darbhaga at 5:30 pm on the evening of May 2, but it is also reaching on 3 May at quarter to seven
 yani 24 ghante se bhi adhik samay kii deree se darbhanga ai he
 Now he has to go to Jayanagar and get ready from there and leave for Delhi
 aap yatriyon ke tanaav kii kalpana kiijie to is report kaa mahatv pataa chalegaa
 Pramod Gupta said that this train was run for the first time on 11 September 2015
 tab se lekar aaj tak yah samay se nahin chalane ke kaaran hi jaani jaati he
 Many times the Samastipur division even tries to cancel this train and run it on time, even then it starts running back late by 5 hours to 22 hours
 darbhanga stesan par yatri puch puch kar pareshaan rahete hai ki swatantraaa senaanee express kab aegi, kab jaaegi
 People coming from villages sit on the platform for ten to twelve hours
 kya inke vakt kii koi keemat nahin he
 Railways would not have given them even a glass of water
 idhar nai dilli railway stesan par yatri kai ghante se intazaar karte rahe, jayanagar se aane vaali or jayanagar ko jane vaali donon train kaa
 One passenger had to leave for Jayanagar from the Freedom Fighter Express of 2 May and a passenger from the Freedom Fighter Express from 3 May
 donon kanphyus baithe the ki 2 may vaali train aaj jaaegi yaa 3 may vaali train aa jaaegi
 On May 3, the freedom fighter Express from Jayanagar at New Delhi station arrived at 6
35 pm
 is train ko do may ke din dopaher saadhe baje aana tha
 Has come late by 30 hours
 sochie is train main agar koi swatantraaa senaanee safar kar rahe hon, or unke saath baithe yatri baar-baar is train kaa naam lekar kos rahe hon ki 20 ghante 24 ghante let rahati he
 No one is the mother father of this train, then how bad would those freedom fighters feel
 sochate honge ki acha hota ham logon ke naam se train hi nahin chalati
 It is an insult to freedom fighters that a train named after them never runs on time
 kya rail mantri piyush goyal is train ko samay se chalaa kar dikhaa sakate hai
 
 
 We have decided that i will mention it every day in prime time until the Freedom Fighter Express runs in independent India
 is train main chalane vaale yatriyon ke anubhav bhayaavah hai
 a passenger messaged us that they often go to Madhubani from Delhi by this train but 12 months of the year, this train runs at a delay of 12 to 18 hours
 kshitij mohan ne 6 oktober 2016 ko is train se yatra kii thi, us din ke running states kaa screen shot bhi bheja he
 He says that then this train was running late by 31 hours
 unka kahana he ki ve is screen shot ko puri zindagi sahej kar rakhenge
 Such are also aware travelers
 ek or yatri mrityujny jha ne apane parivaar ke logon ke liye 1 june kaa tikat kataaya tha, rose is train kaa states check kar rahe the, magar iske let chalane kii aadat se pareshaan ho gaye or tikat hi cancil kara diya
 He was sure that the train would be late
 ham chaahate hai ki somvaar se yah train samay par chalane lage or mrityunjay ji kaa parivaar dobaaraa tikat kataa kar isi train se darbhanga jaae
 Mrityunjaya is right that the working people on this train work
 unke liye ek din kii deree kaa matlab he ek or chuttee or ek chuttee kati to maheene kaa vetan kam ho jayega
 If the Prime Minister calls himself a Kamdar, then the train carrying workers should never be late
 jab rail mantri piyush goyal swatantraaa senaanee express ko samay se chalava denge tab ham duusari train ko samay se chalavane kaa chalange denge jo 20-20 ghante kii deree se chal rahi hai
 Our colleague Salim spoke to Gorakhpur Division Chief Public Relations Officer Sanjay Yadav about how many trains were running late
 unhone bataaya ki april ke maheene main lagbhag 5045 trainen chalaai gayi jisamen se 2,182 gaadiyaan let huin
 More than a minute was considered late
 inhone kaaran bataaya ki apni kshamta se zyaada rail gaadiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 There is also a delay due to the maintenance work being done
 lekin kya yah deree sirf aaj kii he
 For the past several months, many trains have been running late
 yatriyon kii maane to swatantraaa senaanee express kabhi samay se hi nahin chali jo isi root se guzarati he
 Salim spoke to some passengers waiting at Gorakhpur railway station
 kisi ko rajasthan ke hanumangarh janaa he, kisi ko ankleshwar janaa he to kisi ko surat
 Someone is waiting at the station for 12 hours, then for seven to eight hours
 avadh assam express 18 ghante kii deree se chal rahi he
 The station is clean but the running time of the train is the same as it once was, which may have been there forever
 deree kaa kaaran puuchhie to zarur bataaya jaataa he ki is baar durghatana kii daron main bahut hi kami ai he lekin yah to railway kii kshamta main sudhaar bataata he
 How would it mean to delay the speed of the train by 30 hours and then claim that the accident rates have come down
 film nirdeshak anubhav sinha ne tees saal baad rail yatra karne kaa faisla kiya
 He tweeted that nothing has changed even after 30 years
 unhone tay kiya ki lakhanu se varanasi train se chalate hai
 Took ticket for Neelachal Express on 29th April
 is train ko lakhanu se dopaher dhai baje ravaanaa hona tha magar chali raat ke 12 baje
 They reach Varanasi with a delay of ten hours
 twit karte hai ki tivi par badi badi baaten sab jhooth hai
 The truth of Hindustan is hidden from India itself
 tippaniyan Train no
 12487 simanchal express bihar ke arriya zile ke jogbani se chalati he or anand vihaar tak aati he
 On May 1, the train opened 22 hours and 15 minutes late
 railway inquairi kii website bataati he ki yah train 1 din 3 ghanta 8 minute kii deree se anand vihaar pahonchegi yani 27 ghante kii deree se
 If the cost of the time of passengers traveling in these trains would have been worth it, this disease of running late would have been eradicated
 chaar paanch ghante to yatri bardaasht kar lete hai magar 20 ghante or 27 ghante kii deree ko wo kaise samajhaayenge
 Similarly, Patna Kota Express runs late by 24 hours
 is deree ke liye kise zimmedaar tehraaya jaae? agar rail mantri dinemic hai to rail gaadiyaan kyon nahin dinemic hai? ye sari trainen kyon 20 ghante 24 ghante kii deree se chalati hai? naukari series kii tarah kahin ye railway series na chal pade
 There are many trains which are running late by six to ten hours
 kam se kam railway ko 24 ghante kii deree hone par yatriyon ko muawza dena chahie
 We showed the struggle of 12,460 BTC teachers of UP several times
 unhone apane sangharsh se badi kamyaabi hasil kii he
 He was not getting the appointment letter even after winning his case several times from the court
 jab andolan tej kiya to yogi sarkaar ko kahana padaa ki niyukti patr denge or niyukti patr dene kii prakriya shuru ho gai
 Many have found and many are getting
 in sabane prime time ke prati aabhaar vyakt kiya he
 We hope that they will make very good teachers
 yah sahi he ki hamane kai baar dikhaaya magar asli sangharsh inhen logon kaa tha
 The same people kept fighting with each other for months in a court battle, eating sticks on the streets
 aap bhi inhen badhai dijie taaki inkaa utsaah bana rahe
 Now the second battle is whether the system of pension will be able to get back to the people, depending on how much the fighters fight
 iske liye sarkari karmchaariyon ko naitik bal or aatm bal kaa vikaas karnaa hoga
 The 12561 Freedom Fighter Express was scheduled to leave from Jaynagar for Delhi at 2 pm on May 2

 People coming from villages sit on the platform for ten to twelve hours
 kya inke vakt kii koi keemat nahin he
 Railways would not have given them even a glass of water
 idhar nai dilli railway stesan par yatri kai ghante se intazaar karte rahe, jayanagar se aane vaali or jayanagar ko jane vaali donon train kaa
 One passenger had to leave for Jayanagar from the Freedom Fighter Express of 2 May and a passenger from the Freedom Fighter Express from 3 May
 donon kanphyus baithe the ki 2 may vaali train aaj jaaegi yaa 3 may vaali train aa jaaegi
 On May 3, the freedom fighter Express from Jayanagar at New Delhi station arrived at 6
35 pm
 is train ko do may ke din dopaher saadhe baje aana tha
 Has come late by 30 hours
 sochie is train main agar koi swatantraaa senaanee safar kar rahe hon, or unke saath baithe yatri baar-baar is train kaa naam lekar kos rahe hon ki 20 ghante 24 ghante let rahati he
 No one is the mother father of this train, then how bad would those freedom fighters feel
 sochate honge ki acha hota ham logon ke naam se train hi nahin chalati
 It is an insult to freedom fighters that a train named after them never runs on time
 kya rail mantri piyush goyal is train ko samay se chalaa kar dikhaa sakate hai
 
 
 We have decided that i will mention it every day in prime time until the Freedom Fighter Express runs in independent India
 is train main chalane vaale yatriyon ke anubhav bhayaavah hai
 a passenger messaged us that they often go to Madhubani from Delhi by this train but 12 months of the year, this train runs at a delay of 12 to 18 hours
 kshitij mohan ne 6 oktober 2016 ko is train se yatra kii thi, us din ke running states kaa screen shot bhi bheja he
 He says that then this train was running late by 31 hours
 unka kahana he ki ve is screen shot ko puri zindagi sahej kar rakhenge
 Such are also aware travelers
 ek or yatri mrityujny jha ne apane parivaar ke logon ke liye 1 june kaa tikat kataaya tha, rose is train kaa states check kar rahe the, magar iske let chalane kii aadat se pareshaan ho gaye or tikat hi cancil kara diya
 He was sure that the train would be late
 ham chaahate hai ki somvaar se yah train samay par chalane lage or mrityunjay ji kaa parivaar dobaaraa tikat kataa kar isi train se darbhanga jaae
 Mrityunjaya is right that the working people on this train work
 unke liye ek din kii deree kaa matlab he ek or chuttee or ek chuttee kati to maheene kaa vetan kam ho jayega
 If the Prime Minister calls himself a Kamdar, then the train carrying workers should never be late
 jab rail mantri piyush goyal swatantraaa senaanee express ko samay se chalava denge tab ham duusari train ko samay se chalavane kaa chalange denge jo 20-20 ghante kii deree se chal rahi hai
 Our colleague Salim spoke to Gorakhpur Division Chief Public Relations Officer Sanjay Yadav about how many trains were running late
 unhone bataaya ki april ke maheene main lagbhag 5045 trainen chalaai gayi jisamen se 2,182 gaadiyaan let huin
 More than a minute was considered late
 inhone kaaran bataaya ki apni kshamta se zyaada rail gaadiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 There is also a delay due to the maintenance work being done
 lekin kya yah deree sirf aaj kii he
 For the past several months, many trains have been running late
 yatriyon kii maane to swatantraaa senaanee express kabhi samay se hi nahin chali jo isi root se guzarati he
 Salim spoke to some passengers waiting at Gorakhpur railway station
 kisi ko rajasthan ke hanumangarh janaa he, kisi ko ankleshwar janaa he to kisi ko surat
 Someone is waiting at the station for 12 hours, then for seven to eight hours
 avadh assam express 18 ghante kii deree se chal rahi he
 The station is clean but the running time of the train is the same as it once was, which may have been there forever
 deree kaa kaaran puuchhie to zarur bataaya jaataa he ki is baar durghatana kii daron main bahut hi kami ai he lekin yah to railway kii kshamta main sudhaar bataata he
 How would it mean to delay the speed of the train by 30 hours and then claim that the accident rates have come down
 film nirdeshak anubhav sinha ne tees saal baad rail yatra karne kaa faisla kiya
 He tweeted that nothing has changed even after 30 years
 unhone tay kiya ki lakhanu se varanasi train se chalate hai
 Took ticket for Neelachal Express on 29th April
 is train ko lakhanu se dopaher dhai baje ravaanaa hona tha magar chali raat ke 12 baje
 They reach Varanasi with a delay of ten hours

 12487 simanchal express bihar ke arriya zile ke jogbani se chalati he or anand vihaar tak aati he
 On May 1, the train opened 22 hours and 15 minutes late
 railway inquairi kii website bataati he ki yah train 1 din 3 ghanta 8 minute kii deree se anand vihaar pahonchegi yani 27 ghante kii deree se
 If the cost of the time of passengers traveling in these trains would have been worth it, this disease of running late would have been eradicated

 Similarly, Patna Kota Express runs late by 24 hours
 is deree ke liye kise zimmedaar tehraaya jaae? agar rail mantri dinemic hai to rail gaadiyaan kyon nahin dinemic hai? ye sari trainen kyon 20 ghante 24 ghante kii deree se chalati hai? naukari series kii tarah kahin ye railway series na chal pade
 There are many trains which are running late by six to ten hours
 kam se kam railway ko 24 ghante kii deree hone par yatriyon ko muawza dena chahie
 We showed the struggle of 12,460 BTC teachers of UP several times
 unhone apane sangharsh se badi kamyaabi hasil kii he

 We hope that they will make very good teachers
 yah sahi he ki hamane kai baar dikhaaya magar asli sangharsh inhen logon kaa tha
 The same people kept fighting with each other for months in a court battle, eating sticks on the streets
 aap bhi inhen badhai dijie taaki inkaa utsaah bana rahe
 Now the second battle is whether the system of pension will be able to get back to the people, depending on how much the fighters fight
 iske liye sarkari karmchaariyon ko naitik bal or aatm bal kaa vikaas karnaa hoga
 Our colleague Pramod Gupta went to Darbhanga station at 5:30 pm on 3 May

 Pramod Gupta said that this train was run for the first time on 11 September 2015

 Here, passengers waited for several hours at the New Delhi railway station, both for the train coming from Jayanagar and going to Jayanagar
 ek yatri ko 2 may ke swatantraaa senaanee express se jayanagar ke liye janaa tha or ek yatri ko 3 may ke swatantraaa senaanee express se janaa tha
 Both confuse were sitting that the train on May 2 will go today or the train on May 3 will come
 3 may ko nai dilli stesan par jayanagar se aane vaali swatantraaa senaanee express shaam 6 bajkar 35 minute par ai he
 This train was supposed to arrive at half past two on the day of May 2
 ai he 30 ghante kii deree se
 Imagine if some freedom fighters are traveling in this train, and the passengers sitting with them are repeatedly cursing the name of this train that it is late for 20 hours and 24 hours
 koi is train kaa maai baap hi nahin he to un swatantraaa senaanee ko kitna bura lagata hoga
 Would have thought that it would have been better if the train could not run in the name of us
 yah swatantraaa senaniyon kaa apmaan he ki unke naam se bani train kabhi samay se nahin chalati he
 Can Railway Minister Piyush Goyal show this train running on time
 
 
 hamane yah tay kiya he ki jab tak swatantra bharat main swatantraaa senaanee express samay se nahin chalegi prime time main har din iskaa zikr karuunga
 The experiences of passengers boarding this train are frightening
 ek yatri ne hamen messej kiya ki ve is train se aksar dilli se madhubani jate hai magar saal ke 12 maheene yah train 12 se 18 ghante kii deree se to chalati hi he
 Kshitij Mohan traveled by this train on 6 October 2016, has also sent a screen shot of the running status of that day
 unka kahana he ki tab yah train 31 ghante kii deree se chal rahi thi
 He says that he will save this screen shot all his life
 aise bhi jaagruk yatri hote hai
 Another passenger Mrityunjaya Jha had booked a ticket for his family members on June 1, checking the status of this train daily, but got upset with the habit of walking late and canceled the ticket itself
 inhen is baat kaa yakeen tha ki train let hogi hi hogi
 We want this train to run on time from Monday and the family of Mrityunjay ji will be cut again and Darbhanga with this train
 mrityunjay kii baat sahi he ki is train se kaam karne vaale mehanatakash log chalate hai
 For them, one day delay means one more holiday and one vacation cut, then the month's salary will be reduced
 agar pradhanmantri khud ko kaamadaar kehete hai to kamgaaron ko lekar chalane vaali train kabhi let nahin honi chahie
 When Railway Minister Piyush Goyal gets the Freedom Fighter Express run on time, then we will give the challenge of running the second train on time which is running late by 20-20 hours
 hamaare sahyogi saleem ne gorakhpur mandal ke mukhya jansampark adhikari sanjay yadav se baatcheet kii ki kitni gaadiyaan deree se chal rahi hai
 He said that in the month of April, about 5045 trains were run, of which 2,182 trains were late
 ek minute se lekar zyada let maani gayi
 They gave the reason that they are driving more trains than their capacity
 rakrakhaav ke kaam ho rahe hai is vajah se bhi deree he
 But is this delay only today? pichley kai maheene se kai railgadiyaan deree se chal rahi hai
 According to the passengers, the Freedom Fighter Express has never run in time, which passes through this route
 saleem ne gorakhpur railway stesan par intazaar kar rahe kuch yatriyon se baat kii
 Some have to go to Hanumangarh in Rajasthan, some have to go to Ankleshwar and some have Surat
 koi 12 ghante se stesan par intazaar kar rahaa he to saat se aath ghante se
 The Avadh Assam Express is running late by 18 hours
 stesan saaf suthra he magar train ke chalane kaa samay vahi he jo kabhi tha jo shaayad hameshaa se hi rahaa hoga
 If we ask the reason for the delay, it is said that this time the accident rates have come down drastically, but it shows the improvement in the railway's efficiency
 iskaa matlab yah kaise ho jayega ki train kii raftaar 30 ghante deree se kar den or phir daawa karen ki durghatana kii daron main kami ai he
 Film director Anubhav Sinha decided to travel by rail after thirty years
 unhone twit kiya ki 30 saal baad bhi kuch nahin badla he
 He decided that from Lucknow to Varanasi train
 29 april ko nilachal express kaa tikat liya
 This train was supposed to leave from Lucknow at 2:30 pm but lasted at 12 noon
 das ghante kii deree se ve varanasi pahunchate hai
 Tweet that big things on TV are all lies
 hindustan kaa sach hindustan se hi chupa hua he
 The comments gaadi nan
 12487 Seemanchal Express runs from Jogbani in Araria district of Bihar and reaches Anand Vihar
 1 may ko yah train 22 ghante 15 minute kii deree se khuli he
 The Railway Inquiry website states that this train will reach Anand Vihar with a delay of 1 day 3 hours 8 minutes i
e
 27 hours late
 in railgadiyon main chalane vaale yatriyon ke samay kii keemat hoti to der se chalane kii is beemaari ko dur kar diya jaataa
 Travelers can tolerate four to five hours, but how will they explain the delay of 20 hours and 27 hours
 isi tarah patna kota express 24 ghante kii deree se chalati he
 Who is to be held responsible for this delay? If the railway minister is dynamic, then why are the trains not dynamic? Why do all these trains run late by 20 hours and 24 hours? These railway series did not run like a job series
 kai trene hai jo chah se das ghante kii deree se bhi chal rahi hai
 At least the railways should compensate passengers for the delay of 24 hours
 hamane upi ke 12,460 beatisi shikshakon ke sangharsh ko kai baar dikhaaya
 He has achieved great success through his struggle
 adaalat se kai baar apana cese jeetne ke baad bhi unhen niyukti patr nahin mil rahaa tha
 When the movement intensified, Yogi Sarkar had to say that he would give appointment letters and the process of giving appointment letters started
 bahuton ko mil gai he or bahuton ko mil rahi he
 All of them have expressed their gratitude for prime time
 ham ummid karte hai ki ye bahut achche shikshak banenge
 It is true that we showed many times but the real struggle was with these people
 yahi log aapas main chanda karke maheenon adalati ladaai ladate rahe, sadakon par laathiyaan khate rahe
 Congratulate them too so that their enthusiasm remains
 ab duusari ladaai he ki kya pension kii vyavastha logon ko waapas mil sakegi, nirbhar karata he ladane vaale kitna ladate hai
 For this government employees will have to develop moral strength and self-power
 sochie is train main agar koi swatantraaa senaanee safar kar rahe hon, or unke saath baithe yatri baar-baar is train kaa naam lekar kos rahe hon ki 20 ghante 24 ghante let rahati he
 No one is the mother father of this train, then how bad would those freedom fighters feel
 sochate honge ki acha hota ham logon ke naam se train hi nahin chalati
 It is an insult to freedom fighters that a train named after them never runs on time
 kya rail mantri piyush goyal is train ko samay se chalaa kar dikhaa sakate hai
 
 
 We have decided that i will mention it every day in prime time until the Freedom Fighter Express runs in independent India
 is train main chalane vaale yatriyon ke anubhav bhayaavah hai
 a passenger messaged us that they often go to Madhubani from Delhi by this train but 12 months of the year, this train runs at a delay of 12 to 18 hours
 kshitij mohan ne 6 oktober 2016 ko is train se yatra kii thi, us din ke running states kaa screen shot bhi bheja he
 He says that then this train was running late by 31 hours
 unka kahana he ki ve is screen shot ko puri zindagi sahej kar rakhenge
 Such are also aware travelers
 ek or yatri mrityujny jha ne apane parivaar ke logon ke liye 1 june kaa tikat kataaya tha, rose is train kaa states check kar rahe the, magar iske let chalane kii aadat se pareshaan ho gaye or tikat hi cancil kara diya
 He was sure that the train would be late
 ham chaahate hai ki somvaar se yah train samay par chalane lage or mrityunjay ji kaa parivaar dobaaraa tikat kataa kar isi train se darbhanga jaae
 Mrityunjaya is right that the working people on this train work
 unke liye ek din kii deree kaa matlab he ek or chuttee or ek chuttee kati to maheene kaa vetan kam ho jayega
 If the Prime Minister calls himself a Kamdar, then the train carrying workers should never be late
 jab rail mantri piyush goyal swatantraaa senaanee express ko samay se chalava denge tab ham duusari train ko samay se chalavane kaa chalange denge jo 20-20 ghante kii deree se chal rahi hai
 Our colleague Salim spoke to Gorakhpur Division Chief Public Relations Officer Sanjay Yadav about how many trains were running late
 unhone bataaya ki april ke maheene main lagbhag 5045 trainen chalaai gayi jisamen se 2,182 gaadiyaan let huin
 More than a minute was considered late
 inhone kaaran bataaya ki apni kshamta se zyaada rail gaadiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 There is also a delay due to the maintenance work being done
 lekin kya yah deree sirf aaj kii he
 For the past several months, many trains have been running late
 yatriyon kii maane to swatantraaa senaanee express kabhi samay se hi nahin chali jo isi root se guzarati he
 Salim spoke to some passengers waiting at Gorakhpur railway station
 kisi ko rajasthan ke hanumangarh janaa he, kisi ko ankleshwar janaa he to kisi ko surat
 Someone is waiting at the station for 12 hours, then for seven to eight hours
 avadh assam express 18 ghante kii deree se chal rahi he
 The station is clean but the running time of the train is the same as it once was, which may have been there forever
 deree kaa kaaran puuchhie to zarur bataaya jaataa he ki is baar durghatana kii daron main bahut hi kami ai he lekin yah to railway kii kshamta main sudhaar bataata he
 How would it mean to delay the speed of the train by 30 hours and then claim that the accident rates have come down
 film nirdeshak anubhav sinha ne tees saal baad rail yatra karne kaa faisla kiya
 He tweeted that nothing has changed even after 30 years
 unhone tay kiya ki lakhanu se varanasi train se chalate hai
 Took ticket for Neelachal Express on 29th April
 is train ko lakhanu se dopaher dhai baje ravaanaa hona tha magar chali raat ke 12 baje
 They reach Varanasi with a delay of ten hours
 twit karte hai ki tivi par badi badi baaten sab jhooth hai
 The truth of Hindustan is hidden from India itself
 tippaniyan Train no
 12487 simanchal express bihar ke arriya zile ke jogbani se chalati he or anand vihaar tak aati he
 On May 1, the train opened 22 hours and 15 minutes late
 railway inquairi kii website bataati he ki yah train 1 din 3 ghanta 8 minute kii deree se anand vihaar pahonchegi yani 27 ghante kii deree se
 If the cost of the time of passengers traveling in these trains would have been worth it, this disease of running late would have been eradicated
 chaar paanch ghante to yatri bardaasht kar lete hai magar 20 ghante or 27 ghante kii deree ko wo kaise samajhaayenge
 Similarly, Patna Kota Express runs late by 24 hours
 is deree ke liye kise zimmedaar tehraaya jaae? agar rail mantri dinemic hai to rail gaadiyaan kyon nahin dinemic hai? ye sari trainen kyon 20 ghante 24 ghante kii deree se chalati hai? naukari series kii tarah kahin ye railway series na chal pade
 There are many trains which are running late by six to ten hours
 kam se kam railway ko 24 ghante kii deree hone par yatriyon ko muawza dena chahie
 We showed the struggle of 12,460 BTC teachers of UP several times
 unhone apane sangharsh se badi kamyaabi hasil kii he
 He was not getting the appointment letter even after winning his case several times from the court
 jab andolan tej kiya to yogi sarkaar ko kahana padaa ki niyukti patr denge or niyukti patr dene kii prakriya shuru ho gai
 Many have found and many are getting
 in sabane prime time ke prati aabhaar vyakt kiya he
 We hope that they will make very good teachers
 yah sahi he ki hamane kai baar dikhaaya magar asli sangharsh inhen logon kaa tha
 The same people kept fighting with each other for months in a court battle, eating sticks on the streets
 aap bhi inhen badhai dijie taaki inkaa utsaah bana rahe
 Now the second battle is whether the system of pension will be able to get back to the people, depending on how much the fighters fight
 iske liye sarkari karmchaariyon ko naitik bal or aatm bal kaa vikaas karnaa hoga
 Kshitij Mohan traveled by this train on 6 October 2016, has also sent a screen shot of the running status of that day
 unka kahana he ki tab yah train 31 ghante kii deree se chal rahi thi
 He says that he will save this screen shot all his life
 aise bhi jaagruk yatri hote hai
 Another passenger Mrityunjaya Jha had booked a ticket for his family members on June 1, checking the status of this train daily, but got upset with the habit of walking late and canceled the ticket itself
 inhen is baat kaa yakeen tha ki train let hogi hi hogi
 We want this train to run on time from Monday and the family of Mrityunjay ji will be cut again and Darbhanga with this train
 mrityunjay kii baat sahi he ki is train se kaam karne vaale mehanatakash log chalate hai
 For them, one day delay means one more holiday and one vacation cut, then the month's salary will be reduced
 agar pradhanmantri khud ko kaamadaar kehete hai to kamgaaron ko lekar chalane vaali train kabhi let nahin honi chahie
 When Railway Minister Piyush Goyal gets the Freedom Fighter Express run on time, then we will give the challenge of running the second train on time which is running late by 20-20 hours
 hamaare sahyogi saleem ne gorakhpur mandal ke mukhya jansampark adhikari sanjay yadav se baatcheet kii ki kitni gaadiyaan deree se chal rahi hai
 He said that in the month of April, about 5045 trains were run, of which 2,182 trains were late
 ek minute se lekar zyada let maani gayi
 They gave the reason that they are driving more trains than their capacity
 rakrakhaav ke kaam ho rahe hai is vajah se bhi deree he
 But is this delay only today? pichley kai maheene se kai railgadiyaan deree se chal rahi hai
 According to the passengers, the Freedom Fighter Express has never run in time, which passes through this route
 saleem ne gorakhpur railway stesan par intazaar kar rahe kuch yatriyon se baat kii
 Some have to go to Hanumangarh in Rajasthan, some have to go to Ankleshwar and some have Surat
 koi 12 ghante se stesan par intazaar kar rahaa he to saat se aath ghante se
 The Avadh Assam Express is running late by 18 hours
 stesan saaf suthra he magar train ke chalane kaa samay vahi he jo kabhi tha jo shaayad hameshaa se hi rahaa hoga
 If we ask the reason for the delay, it is said that this time the accident rates have come down drastically, but it shows the improvement in the railway's efficiency
 iskaa matlab yah kaise ho jayega ki train kii raftaar 30 ghante deree se kar den or phir daawa karen ki durghatana kii daron main kami ai he
 Film director Anubhav Sinha decided to travel by rail after thirty years
 unhone twit kiya ki 30 saal baad bhi kuch nahin badla he
 He decided that from Lucknow to Varanasi train
 29 april ko nilachal express kaa tikat liya
 This train was supposed to leave from Lucknow at 2:30 pm but lasted at 12 noon
 das ghante kii deree se ve varanasi pahunchate hai

 12487 Seemanchal Express runs from Jogbani in Araria district of Bihar and reaches Anand Vihar

e
 27 hours late
 in railgadiyon main chalane vaale yatriyon ke samay kii keemat hoti to der se chalane kii is beemaari ko dur kar diya jaataa
 Travelers can tolerate four to five hours, but how will they explain the delay of 20 hours and 27 hours
 isi tarah patna kota express 24 ghante kii deree se chalati he
 Who is to be held responsible for this delay? If the railway minister is dynamic, then why are the trains not dynamic? Why do all these trains run late by 20 hours and 24 hours? These railway series did not run like a job series
 kai trene hai jo chah se das ghante kii deree se bhi chal rahi hai
 At least the railways should compensate passengers for the delay of 24 hours

 Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa died on Monday night while undergoing treatment at Apollo Hospital in Chennai for the last two and a half months
 vah ek behad lokapriy mukhyamantri thim, jinhone logon kaa dil jitkar un par shashan kiya
 a few years ago, in an interview to former film actress Simi Grewal, Jayalalithaa spoke openly about various aspects of her life, so let's look at some interesting things done in that interview
 
 
 jab jayalalita sirf do saal kii thim, unke pitaaji kaa dehanth ho gaya tha, or unhen bachapan main hi jayalalita kii maa ko film industry main kariyar banane ke liye chennai janaa padaa, or tab jayalalita apane naanaa ke paas bengaluru main rahati thim
 Jayalalithaa loved her mother the most
 unhone is intervyuu ke dauraan bataaya tha ki jab unki maa unase milane chennai se bengaluru aati thim, tab jayalalita unhen lautne nahin detii thim
 Her mother could not go back, so she tied the pallu of her mother's sari in her hand and slept
 lekin jab is sabake baavjood unki maa chennai chali jaati thim, vah teen-teen din tak roti rahati thim
 When Jayalalithaa was 10 years old, she came to Chennai to live with her mother, but her mother still could not give him much time
 vah subah jayalalita ke uthne se pehle shooting ke liye chali jaati thim or jab tak vah laut paati thim, jayalalita so chuki hoti thim
 Jayalalithaa had to wait till a very late night due to her desire to show the award she once won in school to her mother
 jayalalita acchhee chaatra thim, or skool main hameshaa awwal aati thim
 When he left school, he was also awarded the 'best Outgoing Student' award
 jab jayalalita 16 saal kii thim, unki maa ne unhen acting karne kii salaah di, lekin jayalalita us umr main filmon main kariyar nahin bananaa chaahati thim
 After this, the mother explained to him the situation of the family, then Jayalalitha came to know that the condition of the family was not good
 maa ke sangharsh ko dekhte hue jayalalita ne filmon main acting karne kii unki salaah maan lee
 Jayalalithaa has said many times that she did not like to pursue a career in films, but still she kept signing films at that time
 unhone 125 se bhi zyaada filmon main kaam kiya he
 Nari Contractor has been Jayalalithaa's most loved cricketer
 jayalalita jab skool main thim, tab contractor ko dekhne ke liye vah test match dekhne jaati thim
 Shammi Kapoor has been Jayalalithaa's favorite actor, and her film 'junglee' was Jayalalithaa's favorite film
 agar filmi gaanon kii baat kii jaae, to jayalalita ko 'i maalik tere bande ham
 
 
 'and' Aaja Sanam we in the sweet moonlight
 
 
 ' jayalalita ke sabase zyaada pasandida geet rahe hai
 The comments jab jayalalita 23 saal kii thim, unki maa kaa bhi dehanth ho gaya
 After that Jayalalithaa's life got disturbed, because Jayalalithaa did not know anything about the house
 unhen yah tak pataa nahin tha ki ghar main kitne naukar-chaakar hai, unhen kitna vetan diya jaataa he
 Until then Jayalalitha did not even know how a bank account was operated, what the income tax was, or how much the producers paid for a film
 unke naasamajh hone kii vajah se logon ne jayalalita kaa phayda uthaaya
 In this interview, Jayalalithaa also told that staying in Chennai Central for a month was the most difficult time of her life
 shaadi ko lekar jayalalita kaa nazariyaa kuch alag tha
 She wanted to live a free life
 vah nahin chaahati thim ki unhen koi or niyantrit kare
 She wanted to live life at her own will

 Jayalalithaa loved her mother the most
 unhone is intervyuu ke dauraan bataaya tha ki jab unki maa unase milane chennai se bengaluru aati thim, tab jayalalita unhen lautne nahin detii thim
 Her mother could not go back, so she tied the pallu of her mother's sari in her hand and slept
 lekin jab is sabake baavjood unki maa chennai chali jaati thim, vah teen-teen din tak roti rahati thim
 When Jayalalithaa was 10 years old, she came to Chennai to live with her mother, but her mother still could not give him much time
 vah subah jayalalita ke uthne se pehle shooting ke liye chali jaati thim or jab tak vah laut paati thim, jayalalita so chuki hoti thim
 Jayalalithaa had to wait till a very late night due to her desire to show the award she once won in school to her mother
 jayalalita acchhee chaatra thim, or skool main hameshaa awwal aati thim
 When he left school, he was also awarded the 'best Outgoing Student' award
 jab jayalalita 16 saal kii thim, unki maa ne unhen acting karne kii salaah di, lekin jayalalita us umr main filmon main kariyar nahin bananaa chaahati thim
 After this, the mother explained to him the situation of the family, then Jayalalitha came to know that the condition of the family was not good
 maa ke sangharsh ko dekhte hue jayalalita ne filmon main acting karne kii unki salaah maan lee
 Jayalalithaa has said many times that she did not like to pursue a career in films, but still she kept signing films at that time

 unke naasamajh hone kii vajah se logon ne jayalalita kaa phayda uthaaya
 In this interview, Jayalalithaa also told that staying in Chennai Central for a month was the most difficult time of her life

 jab jayalalita 10 saal kii thim, vah apni maa ke saath rahane ke liye chennai aa gayi, lekin unki maa phir bhi unhen zyaada samay nahin de paa rahi thim
 She would go for a shoot in the morning before Jayalalithaa woke up and by the time she returned, Jayalalithaa was asleep
 ek baar skool main jite puraskaar ko apni maa ko dikhaane kii ichha ke chalate jayalalita ko kaaphi der raat tak intazaar karnaa padaa tha

 When Jayalalithaa was 16, her mother advised her to act, but Jayalalitha did not want to pursue a career in films at that age
 iske baad maa ne unhen parivaar ke halaat ke bare main samajhaayaa, to jayalalita ko pataa chalaa ki parivaar kii haalat thik nahin he
 Seeing her mother's struggle, Jayalalithaa accepted her advice to act in films

 It is further that the Prime Minister must now resign
 rail mantri pawan kumaar bansal or kanoon mantri ashvini kumaar ke istife ko kaaphi der se uthaaya gaya kadam qaraar dete hue bijepi ne sarkaar par aarope lagaaya ki uski maang nahin maanakar usne sansad kaa keemtee vakt barbaad kiya
 BJP hoped that the investigation of railway bribery scandal will now move in the right direction and the truth will be revealed
 tippaniyan Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj wrote on Twitter, "the resignation of the two ministers shows that our demand for their resignation was justified and the government was irrevocably adamant
 yadi unke istife kii hamaari maang sarkaar ne pehle maan lee hoti, to sansad satr jari rah saktaa tha
 Party spokesman Shahnawaz Hussain said, this is a step taken late
 yadi sarkaar ne bijepi kii maang pehle hi maan lee hoti, to ve sansad ke keemtee vakt ko barbaad hone se bachaa sakate the
 Hussain said the resignation was deliberately delayed and the minister had no right to continue in his post

 BJP vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said, the secret of loot is now burning and neither the robbers nor their patrons will be spared

 Describing the resignation of Railway Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal and Law Minister Ashwini Kumar as a step taken too late, the BJP accused the government that it wasted precious time in Parliament by not accepting its demand
 bijepi ne ummid jataai ki railway rishwatakhori cond kii jaanch ab sahi disha main aage badhegi or sachai saamne aegi

 ’’ Now blind people will also be able to visit the National Museum of Delhi and get information about historical things and history
 netraheen log museum main rakhi itihaas ko sanjoe har cheez ko chaahe ankhon se nahin, par apane sparsh se samaj paaenge or uskaa anubhav kar paaenge
 For this, fake samples of things kept in the museum are being made
 is samay neshnal museum main sabhyataa se judi tamaam chijen rakhi hai
 The museum has about 2 lakh specimens of objects related to all historical periods such as Harappan culture, Chola rule, Maurya dynasty, Gupta rule, Mughal period and British period
 ho chuki he 'anubhav' gailaree kii shuruyatek chote str par neshnal museum ko blind friendli banaaya ja chukaa he
 About four months ago, a museum called 'anubhav' was set up in the museum, in which 22 exact specimens of history-related sculptures, paintings, weapons have been kept, which can be touched by the visually impaired tourists
 museum kii sangrah sahaayak shiksha riji shiba ne bataaya ki puraani dharohar ko chune se kharaab hone kaa khatra rahata he or isi baat ko dhyaan main rakhkar kuch namoonon ke saath is gailaree kii shuruyaat kii gai he
 Audio with samples also prepared
 Due to this facility, 70 blind tourists have come to see the gallery so far
 is gailaree kii ek or visheshta he kinetraheen logon ke lievishesh taur par banaae gaye har namoonay ke bare main vistaar se bataata ek audio bhi taiyaar kiya gaya he, jise netraheenon kii jarurat ke hisaab se banaaya gaya he
 According to Shiba, through audio and touch, the blind will be able to know about our civilization to a great extent
 har kaal ke kuch chizon kaa hua chunaadab isi koshish ko bade paimaane par shuru kiya ja rahaa he
 Shiba said that there are about ten galleries in the museum, which contains all the objects associated with each period
 inaki sankhya lakhon main he
 Therefore, samples of all cannot be made, samples of some items are being made from every gallery, so that more information can be obtained about that era
 jaise ki hadappa samskruti se judi murtiyon, bartan, hathiyaaron ke namoonon kaa chunaav kiya gaya he
 Similarly, specimens are being prepared by selecting objects from the gallery
 neshnal museum ke kalakaar bana rahe namoonaynamoonay banane ke liye chaar chizon kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he, jisamen plaster of paris, pathar, metal or fibre glass kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he or inkonational museunkekalakaarhi bana rahe hai
 Overall, through this, the entire National Museum is being merged into a small museum, so that blind tourists can come here to get to know and understand the entire National Museum
 netraheen logon kii jarurat kaa khyalshiba ne bataaya ki dekhne par pataa chal jaataa he ki har yug main chizon ko banane main istemaal kii gai style alag-alag he, chaahe wo murtiyon hon, kapade yaa aabhushan
 One can guess this by looking at these things, but the blind tourist may not know these things
 namoonon ko hoobahoo banane kaa makasad hi yahi he ki netraheen paryatakon ko yahaan aakar puraa majaa aae
 Audio will also be available in Hindi
 Now audio is available in English
 jaise hi nai gailaree banakar taiyaar hogi, uske liye hindi audio bhi jari hoga
 a unique thing about the new gallery is that it will also keep some real specimens associated with each era
 shiba ne bataaya ki iske liye export se salaah lee ja chuki he ki unako chune se uskaa koi nuksaan naa ho
 The aim is that some blind tourists can also guess the real and fake samples

 It is not true that if a child is not good at school, then he will never be successful in life
 safal hone ke liye skool kii padhai main top karne kii nahin balki jindagi kii ladaai ko jitkar aage badhane kii jarurat hoti he
 Often, we assume that a child who does not study well or fails in school in childhood cannot do anything in life
 lekin jo log aisa sochate hai vah ek baar vimal patel ke bare main jaan len
 Who has built a company of 100 crores on the basis of their hard work today
 13 saal kaa shubham bana GOLF kii duniya kaa little tiger, jaane kaisekaun hai vimal patelgujarat ke anand jile ke rahane vaale vimal padhane main achche nahin the
 Due to which he failed in 7th grade
 madhyam parivaar se taalluk rakhane vaale vimal ko ye baaten sunne ko milti thim ki vah jindagi main kuch hasil nahin kar paaegaa
 After failing class, his parents asked him to leave his house and earn his own living
 bataa den skool se aane ke baad vimal doston ke saath ghumaa karte the
 During this time, he learned the work of polishing gems from his father
 is ejeeniyar ne choda lakhon kaa package, shuru kiya chaay bechney kaa kamsangharsh bhare the wo dinek baccha, jo padhai main acha nahin he aise main sabase badi chunauti thi ki vah aage kya kare? kaise paise kamaayen? saal 1996 main vah pehali baar mumbai aae
 Where the real struggle of his life started
 unhone sabase pehle mazdooree kaa kaam mila
 In a big city like Mumbai, he used to get only 4 thousand rupees, due to which he could barely spend his money
 vimal ye jaan gaye the ki mumbai jaise mahange shahar main rahanaa he mazdooree se kaam nahin chalane vaala
 Leaving his wages, Vimal started looking for polish work at several diamond factories in the Cheetah Market in Mumbai because he knew the job well
 vimal ye jaldi hi jaan gaye the ki mazdooree kar ke vah apni takadir kabhi nahin badal sakate
 So he started saving some money from his salary
 jab khud kii company kii shuruvimal ke kuch dost us vakt bina taraashe gaye heere kii marketing kiya karte the
 This earned him a good commission
 vimal ne bhi dhire-dhire yah trick sikh lee or 1997 ke baad se khud bhi yahi kaam karnaa shuru kar diya
 After polishing diamonds for one year, Vimal also worked as a broker and after a few days, he started getting 1 to 2 thousand rupees every day
 phir kya tha un brokar ke bachaae hue paison se unhone khud kii company khol di
 Named 'vimal James'
 shuruyaat main unki company main mahaj 8 log hi kaam kiya karte the
 But by the year 2000, his total turnover had increased to 1
5 million
 mobile lekar class main nahin ja sakenge teachers, jaane kyon?jab sahanaa padaa nuksansangharsh bhare is kariyar main unhen nuksaan bhi hua
 But he did not give up
 unki company ko sabase pada jhatka tab laga jab ek karmchaaree saal 2001 main 29 lakh kaa hira lekar bhaag gaya tha
 Even after this, Vimal's spirits did not waver
 jaise-taise unhone saal 2009 main jalgaanv main khud kaa ek ratna or aabhushanon kaa outlet kholaa
 Vimal's idea was that he would hire an astrologer and customers would buy gems as per the advice of that astrologer
 dekhte hi dekhte vimal kaa ye shandaar idia logon ko pasand aane laga
 Then did Vimal not look back after this? ab agar aap padhai main kamjor bachche ko dekhen to ek baar vimal ke bare main soch len jo 7veen main fail to hua lekin aaj maharashtra main 52 outlets ke maalik he
 The company employs about 550 people

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday accused the opposition parties, including the Congress, of doing politics of 'vote of devotion', as well as challenging those questioning surgical strikes, air strikes to discuss this among the public and question the military's might
 Granted
 bihar ke arriya main ek chunavi sabha ko sambodhit karte hue modi ne kaha, ‘‘aaj desh main ek taraf votbhakti kii raajnneeti chal rahi he or duusari taraf rashtrabhakti kii
 When patriotism inspires, the development of all together becomes the mantra of the government

 He alleged that when the terrorists attacked Mumbai on 26 / 11, the then Congress government did not allow the army to respond as they had to do votebank politics
 unhone aarope lagaaya, ‘‘congress ne pakistan se aaye aatankiyon ko jawaab dene kii bajaae hinduon ke saath aatanki shabd chipkaane kii sajeesh rachi

 isliye party or movement ke hit main ab bispi aage hone vaale sabhi chote-bade chunaav akele apane boote par hi ladegi
 'along with this, Mayawati has made two other tweets
 pehle twit main mayawati ne kaha, 'bispi kii aal india baithak kal lakhanu main dhai ghante tak chali
 After this, the round of state-wise meetings continued till late night in which there was no media
 phir bhi bispi pramukh ke bare main jo baaten media main flash hui hai ve puri tarah se sahi nahin hai jabaki is bare main pressnote bhi jari kiya gaya tha

 It is also written, 'by the way, it is well known that in order to forget all the old grievances with SP, along with the SP government's BSP and anti-dalit decisions in 2012-17, actions against reservation in promotion and deteriorated law and order etc
 Bypassing the alliance with the SP in the country and the public interest, fully fulfilled the religion

 At the BSP national level meeting, Mayawati on Sunday said that Akhilesh did not call me after the coalition lost the election
 satish mishra ne unase kaha ki ve mujhe phone kar len, lekin phir bhi unhone phone nahin kiya
 i took the duty of growing up and called him on the 23rd of counting day and regretted his family's loss
 mayawati ne kaha ki teen june ko jab maine dilli kii meeting main gathbandhan todane kii baat kahi tab akhilesh ne satish chandra mishra ko phone kiya, lekin tab bhi mujhase baat nahin kii

 mayawati (mayawati) ne aarope lagaaya ki mujhe taj coridor cese main fansaane main bijepi ke saath mulaayam singh yadav kaa bhi ahm role tha
 He said that there was injustice in the Akhilesh government with non-yadavs and backward people, so they did not vote
 iske alaava sapa ne pramotion main aarakshan kaa virodh kiya tha isliye daliton, pichhadon ne use vot nahin diya
 It is worth noting that when the alliance of SP and BSP was being announced before the Lok Sabha elections, on that day it seemed that after seeing the gestures of Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav, these two parties will now together do politics for a long time
 ankaganit bhi unke paksh main tha or gorakhpur-phulpur-kairana ke upachunaav main mili jeet se utsaah charam par tha
 But during the Lok Sabha elections, both leaders could not understand the ground reality and faced a crushing defeat

 While SP has got 5 seats, BSP has got 10 seats
 ek tarah se dekha jaae to bispi ko zyada phayda hua he kyonki saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bispi ko ek bhi seat nahin mili thi
 On the other hand, BJP managed 62 seats by destroying all the equations
 is haar ke saath hi bispi supremeo mayawati sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ko nishane par le liya or kaha ki sapa apane kor vot yadavon kaa bhi samarthan nahin paa saki or yahi vajah he ki unki patni chunaav haar gayi

 These statues were installed by former DUSU president Shakti Singh on Tuesday, the last day of his tenure, without permission from the university administration, outside the Arts Faculty Gate on the North Campus
 virodh hone par shuukravaar ko in ardh pratimaaon ko hataa diya gaya
 The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the student wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, issued a statement saying, "by insulting the statues of Bhagat Singh, Savarkar and Subhash Chandra Bose, the NSUI has worked to highlight the mentality of the Congress

 Former DUSU president Shakti Singh said earlier that he tried to get permission from the university administration several times regarding the installation of the statues, but there was no response
 singh ne kaha, "mujhe pataa he ki pratimaa sthapit karne kii prakriya par bahes ho sakati he, lekin ham abivipi main rashtrawaad kaa anusaran karte hai or saavarkar mahaan swatantraaa senaniyon main se ek the
 " america ke raashtrapati banane ke baad se hi vivaadon main rahe donald trump ek baar phir apane vyavhaar ko lekar charchaa main hai
 According to American tradition, Trump has been talking on the phone to the heads of states of the world after becoming president
 isi dauraan trump ne australian pradhanmantri mailkam turnbul ko bhi phone kiya, lekin is baatcheet ko trump ne behad bura qaraar diya
 The talk was to take place within an hour, in 25 minutes, the phone was reported in American newspapers quoting information received from White House officials, that Trump told Turnbull in a phone conversation
 in donon rashtradhyakshon ke bich baatcheet ke liye ek ghante kaa samay tay kiya gaya tha, lekin 25 minute baad hi naaraaz trump ne phone kaat diya
 Why the angry Trump Trump Donald Trump on the Australian PM came from what Turnbull reminded of the US promise that the US would allow 1,250 refugees living in a detention center in Australia
 iske jawaab main trump ne kaha, 'yah ab tak kii sabase kharaab deal he
 Trump has flared Turnbull, saying he is trying to export 'the next bomb attacker on Boston' to the US
 'turnbul se baatcheet sabase kharaab'akhbaar ke mutabik, australian pradhanmantri turnbul se baatcheet main donald trump ne america raashtrapati chunaav main mili baari-bharkam jeet ko lekar shekhi baghaari
 Trump told Turnbull that he also called 4 heads of state, had talks with Russian President Putin as well, but my interactions with you were the worst of them all
 'trump ne buudhvaar raat ek twit kar is samjhaute kii jaankaree di
 He said, 'will you believe it? The Obama administration agreed to bring thousands of illegal migrants from Australia to the US
 kyon? main is bevakoofana samjhaute ke bare main vistaar se padhunga

 Why? i will study this dumb deal!— Donald J

 unka yah vyavhaar vaisaa hi he, jaisaa ki vah apane raajnneetik virodhiyon or media sanghathanon ke khilaaf karte hai
 Australia is one of America's closest allies, so it is surprising to hear Trump talking to Turnbull like this
 donon desh khufia jaankariyaan saajha karte hai, kootnithik sahyog karte hai or iske alaava iraq or afghanistan yuddh main bhi donon desh milakar lade hai

 SPG amendment passed in Lok Sabha: Home Minister Shah's sharp attack on Congress said - Security of Gandhi family was changed
 Around 2 pm, Home Minister Amit Shah introduced SPG bill in Lok Sabha
 jiske baad bill par vistrut charchaa hui
 Several members of the House expressed their views on the bill
 charchaa ke ant main grih mantri ne apana jawaab pesh kiya
 After which a proposal was passed to pass the bill which was passed by voice
 yahaan aapako yah bhi bataa den ki grih mantri ke jawaab se naaraaz congress ke sadsy sadan kii kaarywahi kaa bahishkaar baahar ja chuke the
 Amit Shah said- While presenting the new amendment act compatible with the spirit of the Act, Home Minister Amit Shah said that spg's law was made in 88
 91 or 94 main sanshodhan hua
 99 and 2003 amended
 aaj phir se main ek sanshodhan laayaa hum jo mul bhaavana ke anukool he
 Under this act, SPG protection will be available only to the PM and his family, who live with him in the authorized PM residence
 iske atirikt jo purv pradhanmantri he unako aavantit awaas par 5 saal ke liye praapt hoga
 He further said that its original spirit is contained in its nomenclature itself
 janata main bhranti he ki espiji sirf suraksha kaa kaam karti he
 Whereas SPG protects the pm's office in their communication
 indira ji kii hatya ke baad jo cameti bani usne kaha ki ek vishisht dal pradhanmantri kii suraksha kare iskaa matlab he ki pradhanmantri kii suraksha ho
 The Prime Minister is the head of the government, hence the term protection has been used
 bill par baat karte hue grih mantri ne aage kaha ki duniya main kai deshon ke andar unke rashtradhyaksh kii suraksha ke liye special group bane hue hai
 They only care about the head of state and their work
 is sanshodhan ke peeche uddeshy itnaa he ki espiji or efficient bane or espiji ke kaam main koi kotahi naa ho isliye ham isko lekar aae hai
 i request that all keep their views and accept the bill
 manish tiwari ne uthaae sawaliske baad shuru hui charchaa main congress saansad manish tiwari ne kaha ki aaj ham bahut hi samvedansheel bill par baat karne ke liye ikattha hue hai jo piem kii suraksha se judaa hua he
 i say that history is a witness to the fact that whenever such negative steps have been taken, this country has suffered a huge loss
 sarkaar kisi vyakti ko suraksha kyon pradaan karti he
 Police arrangements were made to protect the people
 phir sarkaar ingit karti he ki kuch log aise hai jinako sarkaar kii taraf se suraksha dene kii jarurat he
 Protection is provided in various categories according to the Threat Assessment
 ye jo threat assesament he kya yah parfect science he
 He further said that security is a very sensitive matter but unfortunately it has become a political preview
 iske saath hi unhone khud se judaa ek vaakya bhi sunaaya
 He said that in 1984, when terrorists killed my father, we were provided security
 ghar bilkul chhavnee jaisi lagati thi
 The government changed in 1990 and all security disappeared in the night
 1991 main waapas sarkaar badali or suraksha waapas
 In his statement, Manish Tiwari also referred to the Rajiv Gandhi assassination and the Verma Commission recommendations made thereafter
 manish tiwari ne aage kaha ki atal sarkaar ne praavdhaan diya tha ki jab tak threat assesament rahe tab tak suraksha di jaae
 This amendment has been brought in that the security which was to be given to former Prime Ministers or their families was removed
 yah vahi kaaran tha jisaki vajah se rajeev gandhi kii espiji protection hataaya gaya tha
 Raising the issue of withdrawal of security from Gandhi family, Manish Tiwari said that from June to November he was constantly being told that your threat assessment was increasing
 aapaki jaan ko khatra he
 But what suddenly changed was that the security was withdrawn in November 2019 without amending the Act
 yah bataane kii jarurat he ki aisi kya vajah thi suraksha waapas le lee gai
 It is unfortunate that history is repeating once again
 main sarkaar se maang karnaa chahta hum ki jitne bharat ke purv pradhanmantri hai yaa unka parivaar he vah jab tak jivit he use espiji suraksha pradaan kii jaae
 In the US, the former president is given the facility of secret service, this facility is in Great Britain and in many countries
 main nivedan karata hum ki dalgat raajnneeti se upar uthakar suraksha kaa mudda dekha janaa chahie
 In his reply, the Home Minister attacked the Congress, Home Minister Amit Shah presented his answer after the discussion
 unhone kaha ki is mahatvapurn bill par kai sadasyon ne hissaa liya
 As far as i carefully listen to the speech of Congress and their allies, it seems that it is being brought to remove the security of Gandhi family
 jo inaki chintaa he vah puraane act ke tahat hi threat kaa vichaar kar badlaav kiya gaya tha
 This act is now being brought
 aisa lag rahaa he ki sarkaar ko gandhi parivaar kii suraksha kii chintaa hi nahin he
 Taking forward his point, Amit Shah said that his security has not been removed and the system has been changed
 main kahana chahta hum ki unako jed plus wyeth aesel diya he aesel kaa matlab he jane vaali jagah par pehle jaakar threat assesment karegaa
 There will be ambulances, doctors, CRPF personnel
 main poochna chahta hum ki espiji banati kaise he, usamen siarpief ke hi jawan hote hai
 The group consists of personnel from various security forces
 vah sirf suraksha hi nahin offis or communication kii bhi suraksha karte hai
 Attacking the Congress, the Home Minister said, "I say on record that this is the first change for a family that has changed so far, which is being brought for the protection of the PM
" chandrashekhar ji kii suraksha lee gai koi nahin bolaa, aaike gujral kii suraksha lee gai koi nahin bolaa, dow
 Manmohan Singh's security was changed, no one said, did not express concern
 ye jo do maapdand he yah puure desh ko samajhnaa chahie
 It is just a family concern
 espiji ko states simbel bana liya gaya he
 With this, someone's security is going to go, then it is going to be for Narendra Modi ji, when he is no more PM, security will be lost for the 6th year
 grih mantri ne aage kaha ki yah keval ek parivaar kii suraksha kii maang he
 i want to assure you that adequate security arrangements have been made
 verma cameti kii baat hui to hamane advance main suraksha di phir espiji hataai
 Everyone has been provided with security
 lekin sabko pradhanmantri kii suraksha nahin de sakate
 Threat assessment was done twice, then a decision was taken
 pehle threat assesment tha iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki abhi bhi threat assesment hoga
 In his reply, he further said that not all Chief Ministers have ZP Plus of CRPF
 vah threat assesment ke aadhaar par diya he
 This has not been done according to political vendetta
 espiji har force ke proreta se banati he
 This is a matter of VVIP culture
 bengal ke andar bijepi ke kaaryakartaaon kii suraksha kii jarurat he isliye di gai he
 There have also given leaders of CPI and Congress
 main aashwast karnaa chahta hum ki suraksha ke nirnay modi sarkaar kabhi bhi vendata ke aadhaar par nahin le sakati
 She is taken in a purely professional manner
 unki suraksha kii puri vyavsatha bhi kii gai he
 About 600 times went into his program with no notice
 20 saal main ek baar bhi piem modi ne nahin hua suraksha foulakuch log 100-100 kilometre kii speed main mahangi bike lekar ghumte hai
 Security vehicles run back and forth
 main kahaan tak bataaunga
 i would like to give an example that for 20 years they have security cover but not even once the security foul came
 unhone apane jivan main kade maapdand banaae hai
 On the other hand SPG makes security a status symbol, so i would say that everyone should learn from our Prime Minister
 river front par piem modi ne vahaan tourism badhaane ke liye suraksha se aage badhkar kadam uthaane kaa faisla liya tha
 He was not fond of eating cold air at high speed there
 teenon sadasyon ko jed plus vid aexel diya gaya he lekin agar yah kahana he ki pradhanmantri vaali suraksha hi chahie to vah sirf or sirf pradhanmantri ke liye he
 To save the people of the national capital Delhi from pollution, a team from delhiiit has prepared an antipollution window, which is different from the common windows in the houses
 ye sirf machharon ko hi ghar main aane nahin degi, balki ghar ko air polution se bhi bachaane main madad karegi
 It has been named as Nezo Filter Pollution Net Window by Delhi IIT team
 khaas baat ye he ki isse barish kaa adhiktar pani ghar ke andar daakhil nahin hota he, jabaki aam khidki se sara pani ghar ke andar daakhil ho jaataa he
 This window made of polymer, nanofibers, is fabricated with nanotechnology
 iske maheen chhed se sarphase tension bad jaati he or pani ghusane nahin paata
 These PM 10 as well as removing the big pollution particles, PM 2
 5 ko 90 fisadi baahar hi roak detii he
 Prateek Sharma of the research team said that not only windows but doors and curtains can also be installed
 nezo filter polution net se bani khaas khidki ek baar lagava lee jaae, to 5 saal tak polution se mukti mil jaaegi
 By putting 'pollution Net with Well Crow' in the common window, it can be turned into a pollution free window
 iskaa kharch 160 rupee prati varg foot aayega, jahaan room purifaire main zyada bijli kii khapat hoti he, vahiin is khaas khidki main koi kharch nahin aata
 According to a research, the indoors in Delhi has 10 times higher resolution than outside
 kya he nezo filter polution net?pratish sharma ne bataaya ki yah filter naak ke chhed se chipke rahete hai or videshi kanon ko sharir main pravesh karne se rokte hai
 It is a biodegradable product
 sharma ne kaha ki isaki laagat kam he, jiske chalate iskaa upyog janata kar sakati he
 He said that the filter PM 10 particles 100 percent and PM 2
 5 kanon ko 95 pratishat tak dur rakhenge
 Filters can last up to 8–10 hours
 nejo filter polution net komaskki tarah istemaal kiya ja saktaa he, jise naino technology kaa upyog karke dizin or viksit kiya gaya he
 PM 2
 5 aapke sharir main sabase dur main pravesh karne main sakasham kan padaarth kaa aakaar he
 It enters the lungs and can then enter your bloodstream
 PM 10 aamtaur par naak ke baalo main funs jaataa he
 Nejo filter PM 2
 5 or PM 10 donon ko rokane main kaaphi had tak sakasham he
 Sachin Tendulkar and Rekha are completing their tenure as Rajya Sabha nominated members
 sansad main rajyasabha se ritair ho rahe 85 saansadon ke liye vidaai samaaroh rakhaa gaya
 However, both Rekha and Sachin were not seen on the bench of Parliament during this period
 lihaaja, sambhav he ki beete 6 varshon ke unke kaarykaal kii tarah is maukey par bhi donon manonith sadasyon kii cricket yaa film main vyastata kii koi majaburi ho
 This is because during their 6-year tenure, both were present in the House for just one or two days in all the sessions of Parliament
 yah maujuudagi isliye bhi rahe jisase unki rajyasabha sadsyta lagaataar bani rahe
 But as far as the question of the responsibility of an MP is concerned in the Parliament, both during their tenure did not give any preference to questioning, answering and making laws
 kya donon ko jisaliye 6 saal pehle manonith kar sansad bheja gaya vah makasad puraa hua?rajyasabha main bataur sadsy rekha ke 6 salrajyasabha website par maujuud aankadon ko dekhen to 6 saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan rekha ne ek bhi sawaal nahin poocha
 Obviously when the question was not asked, there was no communication with them by the Central Government
 jab koi saansad sadan main sawaal poochta he to uskaa jawaab kendra sarkaar dwaara diya jaataa he or us sawaal-jawaab ko sansad ke register main darj kar liya jaataa he or saath hi use rajyasabha kii website par apadet kar diya jaataa he
 However, it is not the case that no initiative was taken by Parliament to include Rekha in the functioning of the House
 rekha ko sitambar 2016 se food, kanjumar afares or public distribution kii samiti main bataur sadsy shaamil kiya gaya
 The Parliament does not have any details of Rekha's contribution to this committee, obviously even here she did not understand the need to say or hear anything
 ise padhein: data li: andekhee-anjaane shaks ke daavon par lard pade hai bijepi-congressfilmi duniya main rekha hameshaa surkhiyon main raheen
 But his name was never mentioned in Parliament during his tenure in Rajya Sabha
 zikr hota bhi kyon jab unhone kabhi bhi saansad kii bhoomika main kuch karne kii koshish hi nahin kii
 Apart from asking questions in Parliament, bringing a bill by the MP is an important part of his responsibility
 lekin rekha ne apane puure kaarykaal main ek bhi bill sansad main pesh nahin kiya
 Now finally, Rekha's presence in the House is showing that her attendance has been the worst among all the nominated members
 unke kaarykaal main agast 2017 tak hue sansad ke kul 373 sittings main vah 18 sittings main shaamil raheen
 That is, his total attendance during the entire tenure was just 5%
 rekha ne sirf ek baar sadan ke satr main shaamil na hone ke liye aplicoshan di or na shaamil ho paane kii vajah film main kaam karne kii majaburi bataai
 However, for some sessions, she disappeared without giving any application
 haalanki rekha ne apane kaarykaal ke dauraan itani saavdhaanee barti ki unki sadsyta puure kaarykaal tak bani rahi
 According to the rule of Parliament, if a Member of Parliament remains absent from the business for 60 consecutive days without notice, there is a provision to terminate his membership
 lekin rekha kii atendence kabhi bhi 60 din ke is niyam ke khilaaf nahin gai or unhen puure kaarykaal tak saansad kii suvidhaayen milti rahi
 As a member of the Rajya Sabha, Sachin has the right to ask questions in Parliament for 6 years, so Sachin Tendulkar's record is much better than the line
 rekha ke shunya sawaalon ke jawaab main sachin ke record main 22 sawaal darj hai jinka byora rajyasabha kii website par shaamil kiya gaya he
 His questions focused on topics such as electrification of railway networks, inclusion of sports as a subject in the new education policy, and railway safety
 sachin ke in sawaalon ke jawaab main kendra sarkaar kii taraf se yoga or sports ko skool subject banane or sports ko complsri subject ke unke sawaalon kaa jawaab bhi diya gaya
 Sachin's questions were answered by the government in December 2015
 sansad kii taraf se unhen bhi information technology se judi samiti kaa 2016 main sadsy banaaya gaya tha haalanki is samiti main unke yogadan kaa byora sansad ne jari nahin kiya he
 At the same time, his name was never discussed in the Rajya Sabha
 ise padhein: centre se tej bhaag rahaa tha akhilesh kaa upi, yogi ke liye khadi hui badi chunautijahan tak sansad ke atendence register kaa sawaal he sachin kii atendence rekha jitani kharaab nahin thi lekin unki atendence ko acha bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 In Sachin's tenure as of August 2017, he has been involved in 25 sittings out of a total of 373 sittings of Parliament
 yani sachin kii atendence kul 7 fisadi rahi
 On the lines of Rekha, Sachin also took such care during his tenure that his membership was never threatened
 sachin ne apane 6 saal ke kaarykaal main sansad ke lagbhag sabhi satron main ek se 2 din hajiri lagaai or kabhi bhi sansad ke satr ke dauraan lagaataar 60 din tak gaayab nahin rahe
 On the other hand, Sachin went missing giving information to Parliament 3 times during 6 years and for this, Sachin cited cricket matches and business busyness

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Two days before the end of the Narmada parikrama of Congress veteran and former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh, Uma Bharti has written a letter to Digvijay Singh
 or is khat nene siyaasi samikarnon ko janm de diya he
 At one time, Uma took away power from Digvijay by calling him 'mr
 Bantadhar'
 ab yadi uma or digvijay main nazdikiyaan badhin to ye na sirf shivaraj ke liye chunauti sabit hoga, balki congress kii ore se khud ko siem cheharaa maanakar chalane vaale jyotiraditya sindhiya ke liye bhi mushkilen khadi karegaa
 Here the Congress is divided into several camps
 shivaraj singh ne apni narmada yatra main uma bharti ko ahmiyat nahin di thi, lekin digvijay ne uma ke prabhaav ko parakhte hue apni narmada parikrama ke samaapan ke maukey par uma bharti ko vyakitgat nimantran bhejkar siyaasi bisaat bichhaani shuru kar di he
 In fact, Uma Bharti has already announced that she will not contest the Lok Sabha elections
 ve madhya pradesh kii raajnneeti main hameshaa se hi sakriy raheen hai or iske peeche yaheen mana ja rahaa he ki uma bharti is baar hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main apane prabhaav ko punerjeevit kar ek baar phir taqatvar rup se ubharna chaahati hai
 For the past few days, Uma Bharti has been continuously attending the programs of Backward Class Conferences in Madhya Pradesh, especially the Lodh Samaj, and has given the message of unity to the people of the society
 uma ne dijvijay se maanga narmada parikrama kaa punyanarmada parikrama ke samaapan ke maukey par digvijay singh ko likhe patr main uma bharti ne kaha,aadarneey bhai sahab, priy digvijay singh ji
 i congratulate you for your successful Narmada Yatra
 aapane evam aapaki dharmapatni ne narmada parikrama kii puraatan manyataon kii maryaada rakhte hue is parikrama ko sampann kiya yah anukaraniya he
 My wish was that if you would call Narmada Parikrama's bhandara, i would definitely go and you also called me with respect, but i am unfortunate that the dates on which the revival of your parikrama is scheduled to take place on 10 April in Champaran Bihar The Prime Minister will address the cleanliness conference
 yah kaarykram hamaare hi vibhaag dwaara yojit hua he
 That's why i will go to Champaran on the evening of 8th April
 aap to jaanate hi honge ki varsh main ek baar swayan ganga ji bhi narmada ji main snaan karke swayan ko pavitra karne aati hai
 i still have the responsibility of cleaning the Ganges, so i myself need the blessings of Narmada ji
 champaran kaa kaarykram samaapt hote hi 10 april ke baad aap donon jahaan honge, aap donon ko gangaajal bhent karke aap donon kaa aashirwad luungi tathaa is parikrama se praapt punya main se thodaa sa hissaa aap donon mujhe bhi dijiega
 Your younger sister with this desire
 
 Uma Bharshivraj Singh and Uma have a political confrontation
 Sometimes in Madhya Pradesh, the credit of taking power from the hands of the Congress and feeding the lotus goes to Uma Bharti
 digvijay singh ke baad vah mukhyamantri bani thim
 He later had to resign
 iske baad vah madhya pradesh main haashie par jaati raheen
 Angered, she formed her own party, but she did not succeed
 shivaraj singh ne puri takat lagaakar uma bharti ko bada malahara se chunaav tak harva diya tha
 After this, there was a rift in Uma and Shivraj
 haal hi main ken-betwa project par bhi shivaraj ne adnga daalkar uma ko jhatka diya tha
 At the same time, Shivraj did not give any importance to Uma Bharti in the Narmada Yatra
 uma se shivaraj ko isliye hogi mushkilpichley kuch dinon main uma or shivaraj ke bich badi talkhiyaan madhya pradesh main bhaajapa ke liye kam samasya khadi karne vaali nahin hai
 Uma Bharti has indicated her resentment from the central leadership to Madhya Pradesh after the reshuffle in the cabinet
 netritv bhi unke is prabhaav ko nazarandaaj nahin kar sakaa he
 Uma Lodh is considered to be the most accepted leader of the society
 is samaaj ko pradesh kii kareeb 70 siton par prabhaav he
 That is, it is difficult for BJP without the support of Lodh Samaj
 isi ke maddenjar shivaraj singh ke liye uma bharti raajnneetik baadha se kam nahin hai
 Shivraj has also favored leaders like Prahlada Patel for this cut, but the influence of Uma is quite wide
 sindhiya ke saamne dijvijay sabase badi chunautimadhya pradesh main jyotiraditya sindhiya ko aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main siem phase kaa pramukh daavedaar mana ja rahaa he
 Major leaders like Kamal Nath are also seen in support of Scindia, but here are not in support of Congress state president Arun Yadav and leader of opposition Ajay Singh Scindia
 inke saath hi dijvijay singh bhi nahin chaahate ki chunaav sindhiya ke netritv main ho
 This mutual confrontation of the leaders is a challenge for the Congress
 congress ke pravaktaa pankaj chaturvedi kehete hai, ''congress main koi takaraav nahin he
 There is no political confrontation between Scindia and Dijvijay Singh
 unhone sindhiya ko hameshaa aashirwad diya he
 "hardik started Scindia's advocacy
 Just before the election, Hardik Patel's activism in Madhya Pradesh also has political significance
 hardik yahaan patidaar samaaj ke saath pichhadon ko bhaajapa ke khilaaf ekajute karne kii muhim main hai
 With this, Hardik also announced that if Jyotiraditya Scindia was made the CM face, he would put all his strength to win the Congress
 hardik kaa yah bayaan darshata he ki vah sindhiya samarthak hai or yahi baat sindhiya ke khilaaf congress main lakeer khinchne vaale netaaon ko hajam nahin ho rahi he
 Perhaps even Digvijay Singh would not like anyone coming from Gujarat to support the cm's name in his own style
 *** Pre-mature babies have a strong heart if they drink mother's milk
 ek study main paaya gaya he ki bade hone par pre-maior bacchon kaa heart wolum or function, samay se paidaa hue bacchon kii tulana main kam hota he
 However, this problem is less in children who drink only breast milk in the beginning
 oxford uniwarsity ke vaigyanik adam levandoski ke mutabik, ''best baby formula main bhi growth factor, anzimes or antibodies kii kami hoti helekin maa ke doodh main ye sab mil jaataa he
 "these results show that those people whose development has some shortcomings due to premature birth, breast-feeding removes those shortcomings
 aapako bataa den ki janm ke kuch maheenon ke andar hi heart main badlaav aana shuru ho jaataa he
 This study has appeared in General Pediatrics
 rigelt par royal college of pediatrics and child health ke professor rasal viner kaa kahana he ki yah ek mjedaar research he
 This gives more information about the benefits of breast-feeding
 jo bachche shaareerik rup se puri tarah se taiyaar hone ke pehle hi is duniya main aa jate hai, unke liye breast-milk bahut hi jaruri he
 This protects them from many types of infections
 isse aage chalakar bacchon ke dimag, blad-pressure or haddiyon par sakaaratmak prabhaav padataa he
 One woman reported that her father was suffering from terminal cancer
 unhone apane pita ko breast-milk pilaayaa jisase wo ek saal zyada jinda rahe
 Helen Fijssimons, 40, says she stored her baby's milk for her 72-year-old father
 hellen ne kisi research main padhaa tha ki breast-milk immunity system ko badhaata he

 paswan ne patna main patrakaron se charchaa karte hue kaha, "kharaab mausam ke kaaran is varsh pyaaj ke utpaadan main kami ai he
 Last year, where onion production was 194 lakh tonnes, onion production has been 189 lakh tonnes this year

 The comments kendriya mantri ne kaha ki yahi kaaran he ki sarkaar jiesti vidheyak sadan main paas karana chaahati he, parantu ab tak aisa nahin ho sakaa
 He said that with the passage of this bill, the increase in prices of food items will be stopped to a great extent
 rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) main seat bantwaare ke vishay main puche jane par unhone kaha ki lok janashakti party (lojpa) ne bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ko apni chintaa bataa chuki he

 ) At a time when the whole country is angry at Unnao and Kathua's rape case and for their shameless efforts to save the guilty, on Thursday midnight, Congress President Rahul Gandhi came to India Gate with his team
 rahul gandhi ne desh ko jhakzor kar rakh dene vaale in aapraadhik maamalon par sakht karrwai kii maang kii or mahila suraksha ke mudde par system kii asamvedansheeltaa par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 Rahul Gandhi called the BJP government insensitive in the Unnao case and questioned the silence of PM Modi
 Thousands of men and women stood up to be counted in the battle for justice and to protest the rising acts of violence against girls and women
 i thank each and every one of you for your support
 It shall not be in vain

 com / iwmtqsxv4m— Rahul Gandhi (@rahulgandhi) April 13, 2018 Earlier, Rahul Gandhi tweeted and said that my heart is saddened by these incidents like millions of Indians
 ham mahilaon ko is haal main nahin chhod sakate
 Let us participate in the candle march at India Gate for peace and justice
 rahul kii is apil par aadhi raat ko india get par yuvaaon kaa hujum umad padaa
 This was another view of the changed politics of the Congress and the younger style of Rahul
 haal ke varshon main rahul li se hatakar apni siyasat se yuvaaon ko conect karne main teji se safal hue hai
 It is not the first time that Rahul Gandhi has done this
 yahaan jaaniye paanch aise maukon ke bare main jab modi sarkaar ke khilaaf rahul yuvaaon-daliton, kisaanon ke muddon ko uthaakar unase conection jodne main safal dikhe
 Where PM Modi or BJP had an opportunity for action before but nothing happened and Rahul's voice was raised while understanding people's hopes
 1
 The country's anger over the unnao-kathua case and the silence of modi-bjp delaying action on the BJP MLA accused of rape in Unnao and delay in taking action after the death of the victim's father in police custody where BJP was the target and Jammu The country was angry at the gruesome case of rape and murder of an 8-year-old innocent girl in Kathua, then at midnight Rahul Gandhi gave a candle march and gave his voice to the country's anger
 Modi government at the Center and brought the yogi Government of Uttar Pradesh
 aakhirkaar shuukravaar subah sibiai ne kuldeep senger ko giraftaar kiya lekin isse pehle modi or yogi sarkaar ke khilaaf logon kaa gussa charam par pahunchaa gaya
 This silence of the government gave Rahul Gandhi a chance to take credit
 2
 When the Dalit youths called for the Bharat Bandh on 2 April against the change in SC / ST Act, Rohit Vemula and JNU case SC / ST Act, Rahul Gandhi supported their demands and said that Dalit youth are fighting for their rights Salute them is maamle par kade virodh ke baad modi sarkaar ko aakhirkaar supreme court main punarvichaar yachika bhi daakhil kerani padi or dalit samudaay ke saamne baar-baar safai deni padi ki unki ore se na to is maamle main koi badlaav kiye gaye the or naa hi sarkaar aarakshan vyavastha main badlaav kii koi koshish sarkaar kar rahi he
 If the government had already taken steps here, Rahul Gandhi would not have had the opportunity to cash in on the issue in his favor
 isi tarah rohit vemula or jeenyu cese main bhi rahul gandhi ne li se hatakar yuvaaon kaa samarthan kiya or modi sarkaar ko gherne main kaamyaab hue
 3
 bhatta parsul or kisaanon kaa muddamai 2011 main upi main basapa kii sarkaar thi or greater noida ke bhatta parsul gaanv main express-ve pariyojna ke liye bhoomi adhigrahan ke khilaaf kisaan pradarshan kar rahe the
 Rahul Gandhi took a historic step
 prashasan kii roak ke baavjood rahul gandhi unhen chakma dekar bike se bhatta parsul pahunche or kisaanon ke sangharsh ko apana samarthan diya
 Similarly last year, when farmers in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh were on strike to protest their demands against the Modi government, Rahul Gandhi also reached there and raised his voice on the issues of farmers
 4
 Before the successful use of soft Hindutva, the BJP government, which won the elections with a huge majority in 2014 with the Hindutva card, is under pressure to take steps on many issues including Ram Mandir, triple divorce, while Rahul Gandhi reversed the traditional Congress policy
 Abandoned and adopted the policy of soft Hindutva
 gujarat ke chunaavon main is formule ko lagu karte hue rahul gandhi lagaataar mandiron main jate rahe
 The result is in front of everyone
 gujarat chunaav main ve congress ko bahumat ke kareeb le jane main safal rahe
 Although the government was made by the BJP, but before 2019, in the political riot, with this stance, Rahul Gandhi established the Congress as a serious contestant
 isi tararah karnataka main bhi lingayat daanv or tamaam mathon kaa daura kar rahul gandhi bijepi kii hindutv kii politics kii dhar kamjor karne main safal dikh rahe hai
 5
 jab sansad main adwani kaa haal poochne pahunch gaye rahulsiyaasi pratidwandita apni jagah he lekin rahul gandhi ne pichley maheene sansad satr ke dauraan ek alag tarah kaa kadam uthaaya
 Suddenly, Rahul Gandhi reached to ask senior BJP leader LK Advani about his health
 vahiin ek kaarykram main piem modi or sansad ke galiyare main bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko dekhakar bilkul dhyaan die bina aage bad gaye
 Later in a rally in Karnataka, Rahul Gandhi said that whenever PM Modi meets, he just says hello and does not talk about any serious issue
 jabaki pehle ke pradhanmantri vipaksh ke netaaon se bade muddon par baat karte the
 Rahul Gandhi tried to indicate here that PM Modi's work is like a one man show while he follows the policy of taking all parties together
 film jon dedyrector ahisor solomonector nasiruddin shah, randeep hooda, sharnaj patel, sharat saxena, elena kazan, vipin sharma, makrand deshpandepaanch main se ek star
 Sir is a producer
 unhone niraj pandey naam ke ek ladke kii kahani par daanv lagaaya
 The film was made a Wednesday
 kam bajet kii shandaar acting
 The memorable character film, which is still seen on TV when it is done, is seen in a better way
 produsar sahab ko laga ki unhen ek chaalu formula mil gaya
 He caught the second director, bolstered a Spanish La Qaza 507 story and took Naseeruddin Shah as an old lesson
 film bani jon de
 Which is a very tight, confused, unfinished story and a boring sea thriller
 ye film e vednesade se bhi prerit lagati he
 Nasir was a common man, his motive and preparations were big
 yahaan naseer jon de ke role main hai
 His motive is purely personal and finally he kills everyone like an average Bollywood hero
 is auchak firing main ham bhi mar se jate hai
 John Day is the story of a bank manager of the same name
 uski beti ek haadase main mar gai
 John and his wife are desperately trying to recover from the accident
 tabhi unke saath ek or haadasa ho jaataa he
 Now old John decides that he must do something
 udhar ek asipi he
 Who has alcoholic girlfriends and is a land deal
 is deal ke do kinaaron par khadey hai do don
 Pathan sitting in Dubai and Khan in spades from Mumbai
 inke bich asipi kaa zyada se zyada paisa banane kaa khel tab tak chalata he, jab tak uski raah main jon nahin aa jaataa, jiske paas ek bhavuk makasad he or usamen madad ke liye divine kismat bhi
 In the end, everyone gets their film justified
 film main nasiruddin shah ne acchhee acting kii he
 But the story is so frivolous that it all goes waste
 unki patni ke role main kuch der ke liye hi sahi sharnaj patel raahat detii or kuch ummid jagaati najar aati hai
 Randeep Hooda looks as if he has constipation, hangover and chewing gum in one of his jaws
 natijatan dekh rahe hai, to atak gaye hai tip kii nigahen, chabe chabaae samvaad or flats phase saamne aate hai
 In her girlfriend's role, Elena looks like she has difficulty speaking Hindi
 gangster or fishan vaali kangana kii judawaan bahan dikhti hai wo screen par, bolti bhi kuch vaise hi atak kar hai
 There are many good actors in the film
 magar unke paas role nahin tha zyada kuch
 For example
 makrand deshpandey yaa anant mahadevan
 Vipin Sharma has got some space and at the same time he gets tickled by the Amitabh factor of his chain
 sharat saxena kii acting acchhee he
 But like everyone else, his role also hangs in the balance in the form of saying a lot
 film main dharmik pratikon ke sahare kuch darshanik sa kehane kii koshish kii gai lagati he
 Every human has a wolf
 har koi apane ateet ke andheron main ghira rahata he
 Something else like this
 jon kaa dharm isai he, to ek jagah vah pitataa he, to cross par girtaa he or phir chamatkaar sa twist aa jaataa he
 ACP is still governed by childhood accidents
 khan bhi apane gunahon kii khud ko sajaa detaa rahata he, phir bhi mafiagiri nahin chodta
 The film uses lyrical manner
 wo gali main kehete hai na, be bahut gaakar gaali de rahe ho
 By the same type
 iske alaava khun khachchar ke kuch aise seen hai, jinhen dekhakar ubakaai si aane lage
 These are the disadvantages of watching more of Tarantino's dvds
 film thriller bataai ja rahi he
 But his first bet, speed and first need, a thrill-filled story, both missing here
 bas itminan is baat kaa kar sakate hai ki bich bich main gane nahin aate
 ACP does not go to any dance bars
 villen ke yahaan mujra nahin hota
 There is something of a dialogue style in the middle of a tired story
 magar ghun maare ja rahe hon, to genhu koun bachaa paaegaa
 i would not recommend watching John Day at all
 baaki aapaki marji he apane de kii kismat tay karne kii

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that after demonetisation, the record of the number of tax payers has increased rapidly

 jabaki 10 lakh log yaa to ritair hokar yaa phir maut kii vajah se is suchi se baahar ho jate the
 In total there were an average of 5 million people paying new taxes every year

 aakhirworld kapmen chal hi gaya westeindies ke kris gail kaa balla or wo bhi aisi dhuandhar pari ke saath ki unhone world cap or vanade ke kai record ek saath tod daale
 Many big innings have been played in the Cricket World Cup so far, but no batsman has scored a double century in this great game of cricket and Gayle did it while playing at Manuka Oval against Zimbabwe
 apni 215 ranon kii pari ke dauraan gail ne world cap main sarvaadhik vyaktigat ranon kaa gairi karston kaa record tod daalaa
 Kirsten smashed an unbeaten 188 against the UAE in the 1996 World Cup
 vaise yah vanade cricket main laga paanchvaan doharaa shatak he
 With this double century, Gayle has also become the first non-indian cricketer to score a double century in ODI cricket
 isse pehle vanade cricket main chaar dohare shatak lage hai or chaaron maukey par yah bhartiya ballebaajon dwaara lagaae gaye hai
 The first double century of ODI is in the name of Sachin Tendulkar
 yahaan is baat kaa zikr karnaa jaruri he ki yah pehla doharaa shatak bhi 24 farvari ko hi lagaaya gaya tha
 Sachin played this innings of 200 runs against South Africa in 2010
 iske baad bharat ke hi virendra sahvaag (219) ne disambar 2011 main westeindies ke khilaaf vanade cricket kaa doosraa doharaa shatak lagaaya
 Rohit Sharma of India scored two double centuries after this, 209 against Australia in November 2013 and 264 against Sri Lanka in November 2014
 apni is pari ke dauraan kris gail ne ek ke baad ek kai record tod daale:1
 Gayle's double century was made in 138th ball, so he broke the record of the fastest double century by Virender Sehwag (140 balls)
 2
 The record for the most sixes in a single World Cup match
 gail ne apni pari ke dauraan 16 chakke jade
 3
 apni pari ke dauraan 16 chhakkon ke saath gail world cap or vanade cricket kii ek pari main rohit sharma or e bi divilliars ke saath sabase adhik chakke lagane vaale cricketer ban gaye hai
 4
 gail or sampuls ne world cap kii sabase badi saajhedaari kaa record bhi tod daalaa
 Earlier, the record for the highest partnership for any wicket in the World Cup was 311 runs, which was made for the second wicket against Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly in the 1999 World Cup against New Zealand
 5
 The 372-run partnership between Gayle and Samuels has also become the biggest partnership of ODI cricket
 6
 Chris Gayle has also become the second West Indies batsman to score a century against Zimbabwe in the World Cup
 7
 It has also become the biggest innings played in the World Cup against Zimbabwe
 unhone kapil dev ke naabad 175 ranon kaa record todaa
 8
 zimbabwe ke khilaaf westeindies kii ore se sabase badi pari
 Earlier, this was the record for the legendary West Indies batsman Garden Greenies, who scored an unbeaten 105 in the 1983 World Cup
 9
 Gayle also broke the record of 169 runs scored by Brian Lara and Dinesh Ramdin during his innings
 ab tak yah westeindies kii ore se kheli gai sabase badi vanade pari thi
 10
 yah zimbabwe ke khilaaf world cap main banaai gai 15veen centuri he
 However, this number has increased to 16 after Samuel's century
 11
 Chris Gayle is already the West Indies' highest century player in ODI cricket
 is shatak ke saath hi unhone srilanka ke kumaar sangakaara or dakshin africa ke harshal gibs ko peeche chhodte hue kohli or ganguli kii list main shaamil ho gaye hai
 Now ahead of them only Sanath Jayasuriya (28), Ricky Ponting (30) and Sachin Tendulkar (49)
 12
 During the innings, as Chris Gayle reached 79 runs, his total ODI runs reached 9000
 iske saath hi gail un cricketron kii list main shaamil ho gaye jinhone vanade main 9 hajaar se adhik ran banaae hai
 Now the number of runs of Gayle in odis has reached 9136
 desh main pichley 8 november kii madhya raatri se lagu notebandi ke baad puraane note ko badalane kii muhim chal rahi he
 Long lines of people are engaged in front of banks to change notes
 lekin bihar ke vibhinn thanon nen jabt rupee kaa kya hoga is ore kisi kaa dhyaan nahin he
 If no action is taken in this regard till December 30, then what will happen to the money seized in the police stations of Bihar after December 30 is a matter of great concern
 bihar puliceessociesan ne isi chintaa ko lekar bihar ke dijipi ko ek patr likhaa he
 In a letter to the DGP, it has been requested to initiate a direction to issue a direction in this regard by contacting the RBI and the court
 bihar police associesan ke adhyaksh mrityunjay kumaar singh ne dijipi kaa dhyaan is ore aakarshith karaate hue patr main ullekh kiya he ki bihar ke kareeb 1800 thane or opi ke malkhane menkarodon rupejabt kiye jane ke baad se pade hai
 When demonetisation comes into force in the country, the seized rupees will also have to be replaced, but no guidelines have been issued by the RBI or the court in this regard
 30 disambar tak hi puraane note ko badalane kii samay seemaa nirdhaarit he, aise main usase pehle koi na koi disha nirdesh bihar ke thanadhyakshon ko milanaa chahie taaki wo samay par note ko badalawa saken
 It is also mentioned in the letter that if this does not happen, then after 30 December, the station heads may have to face a lot of problems
 bihar police associesan ke adhyaksh mrityunjay kumaar singh ne kaha ki agar court ke dwaara kisi ke jabt note ko 30 disambar ke baad relies karne kaa aadesh de diya jaataa he ormalakhanaamein jamaa rupee ko nahin badla gaya to aise main wo note us vyakti ke liye kaagaj ke samaan hoga jiskaa note jabt kiya gaya tha or wo us note ko lene se inkaar bhi kar saktaa he
