 ) There is good news for teachers across the country
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar chaahate hai ki wo vartmaan main jo shikshakon kii ritairement kii umr 60 saal he use badhaayaa jaye
 Nitish Kumar was speaking at an education department program in Patna on Monday
 nitish kumaar ne shikshakon ke ritairement umr badhaane kii maang karte hue patna ke ek kaarykram main kaha ki aajkal saath saal main ritair karte hai, 60 saal main ritairement main kuch he
 i have always demanded that it be increased
 uske baad nitish kumaar ne 21 varsh purv kii ek ghatana kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki shraddhey atalji kii sarkaar main jab main mantri tha tab 1998 main ritairement kii umr do saal badha di thi
 When the government ran, it was decided to immediately increase the age limit
 nitish kumaar ke anusaar 58 saal main ritair hone ke baad kitni takaleef hoti thi, jabaki kaam karne kii puri kshamta rahati thi
 Nitish Kumar admitted that even today, in 60 years, everyone has full freedom to work, so the retirement age should be increased
 lekin agar aap ritair kar gaye hai tab sabhi kaamon main dhyaan dijie
 However, he said that the decision in this regard will have to be taken by the central government, which will be implemented by every state government
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki bhale nitish kumaar ne ye baat dil se kii ho lekin agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main iskaa asar hoga
 The group of teachers who remain aggressive will not take the risk of protesting, at least after their feelings and declarations
 is bich likhe gaye kuchhek upanyaason ne apane vishay kii naveenta or vastu drushti kii moulikta ke chalate pathakon kaa dhyaan khinchaa he
 Although these novels will be called unicameral and fragmentary in another sense, but due to their limited concise physique and seriousness of thought, they will continue to mute the importance of their importance
 is arth main ranendra ke upanyaas global gaanv ke devtaa ko avismaraneey kaha ja saktaa he
 i would also like to put the truth of the almost incomprehensible narrator Prakash Kant's novel Unfinished Sun in the same community, which keeps the readers hooked to the end due to their thought-provoking language and consciousness-called trauma-causing power and tragic plot
 upanyaas kii kathavstu kaa sambandh ek aise vidambnaapurna kathanak se he, jo aazaadee ke aas-paas or uske baad kii saamaajik soch or bikharaav ko hi nahin, uski pashchgamita or saamaajik pratigamita ke chintaneey parinaamon ko apane pathakon tak pahunchaakar unki chetana main uthal-puthal paidaa karata he
 The narrow-mindedness of caste and religion and the power-hungry politics of our time that have developed on the basis of these, the small fragmented Hindustan or Pakistan within this Indian society, would have given the tragic prior information of the future of this very ancient Indian society
 Huh
 upanyaas main gangaaraam naam kaa ek dalit isai dharm grahan karata he
 Parallel to this, a ritualist Brahmin's son, receiving the supremacy of Gandhi, marries a Muslim maiden, Roshni, who grows up in the Gandhi Ashram, and generates a revolutionary break in her sanatani clan traditions
 hindu samaaj kii ye do gatishiltaaen kahi ja sakati hai
 But all this leads us to those cursed truths of proselytizing and interreligious relationships, where the lives of children born as a result of this make them socially stigmatized and humiliating
 umashankar or roshni se paidaa hua betaa aman haalanki hindutv kii ore jhukaa hua he, phir bhi vah jis bhay, ashuddhta-granthi or asamanjas kaa shikaar he, usase upanyaas main traaskaari manovaigyaniktaa kaa janm hota he
 But this psychology reminds us of the readers again and again the social pains of the Sutaputra Karna of Mahabharata, which we Indians have been experiencing
 par sthitiyaan badali hai
 Varna and caste purity and arrogance are lying loose
 haa, is bich varna or jati ke vibhed bheetar hi bheetar bade hai or jadtaaen saghan hui hai
 Aman, the main character, succumbs to these inertia and commits suicide
 sawaal tab bhi uthta he ki jis krantikari dampati kaa vah putr he, vah sangharsh karne or samay ko aage le jane kaa naayakatv kyon nahin dikhaa paata he? kyon yah upanyaas hamaare krantikari manobal ko ghataata he? vaicharik drushti se kya ise lekhkeey aatmghaat nahin kaha jayega jabaki lekhak khud pragatisheel vichaardhaara se apana sambandh jodta ho
 Yet the craft of the novel is highly structured and well-maintained, and the language is a zeal for serious deliberation
 ati puraane-se vishay ko samakaleen vimarshon ke bich uthaakar jin aadarshon kii haar yahaan dikhaai gai he, ve us sambhavit samaaj ke behad aade aate hai, jise gandhi aadi ne sapane ke rup main dekha tha
 Probably Bhagat Singh etc

 Especially given that two super powers ie America and Russia have come face to face in the name of Iran
 jahaan america iran ko sabak sikhaane kii dhamkee de chukaa he, vahiin rus ne saaf kar diya he ki agar america iran par hamalaa bolta he to iskaa anjaam khaufnak hoga kyonki wo chup nahin baithegaa
 However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is busy trying to reconcile with Iran, but the question is whether peace will be established? How fragile the situation is, a sensational revelation of President Donald Trump
 khud trump ne kaha he ki america sena ne iran ke teen thikaanon par hamalaa karne kii puri taiyaari kar lee thi
 But he changed his decision just 10 minutes before the attack
 donald trump ne isaki vajah bataate hue kaha, ''maine poocha ki hamale main kitne log maare jaaenge? sena ke general ne pehle mujhase thodaa vakt maanga
 Then told me that about one hundred and fifty people could be killed in the attack
 maine is par phir se sochaa
 i said that they have flown an unmanned drone and in response we will be responsible for the death of 150 people in half an hour
 maine kaha hamalaa roak do
 "the war is still postponed
 Now what would have happened if the US had attacked three Iran bases? Iran would have retaliated and Russia would have jumped into war on Iran's side
" jaahir he anjaam bhayanak hota
 But the danger is still not averted
 america or iran ab bhi ek-duusare ko dhauns de rahe hai
 a series of threats are going on daily
 america ab tak iran par hamalaa bol bhi chukaa hota
 But America's friend country itself is not with the US on the issue of Iran
 britain, france, germany, china, rus or european union america karrwai ke virodh main najar aa rahe hai
 There is a single Israeli who stands with the US on this issue
 yahi vajah he ki jang ab tak tali hui he
 The question is, what has happened suddenly that has put the world at risk again? To understand this, one must first know that statement of Trump three years ago
 trump ne ye baat america raashtrapati ke chunaav ke dauraan chunavi prachaar main kahi thi
 What will Trump do to win the election? Three years ago, Donald Trump made it clear that Barack Obama and five other countries have an agreement with Iran regarding the nuclear reactor
 isse kuch nahin hone vaala
 Trump also promised in his election campaign that he would end the agreement with Iran if he became president, and on 8 May 2018 he also ended the deal
 yaad rakhen, america main 2020 main phir se chunaav he, or trump chunavi maidan main hai
 By attacking Iran, they want to win the election again by uniting American voters on the issue of nationalism, and that is why the issue of Iran has become heated just before the election
 haalanki jis tark ke saath trump iran ke khilaaf khadey hai, us tark ko unke apane hi mitra desh galat maan rahe hai
 Therefore, like the Afghan war, the Gulf war, or the Iraq and Syria war, this time America is not getting the support of any friendly country with regard to Iran
 yani iran ke maamle main america alag-thalag padaa he
 Now the question in such a situation is, will he still dare to attack Iran? Before knowing the answer to this question, let us understand what was the agreement about the nuclear reactor which Trump broke but the other countries did not break it
 iran par america itnaa talkh kyon?aakhir america iran ko lekar itnaa talkh kyon he? khaas kar trump sarkaar
 To understand this, it is necessary to understand a deal that is four years old
 asal main 2006 main iran ne apane yaha paanch parmaanu riector lagaae the
 One of them was planted with the help of Russia
 ise lekar kai deshon kii nazren tedi hui thim
 Especially Israel and America
 haalanki iran baar-baar kah rahaa ki ye parmaanu bijli ghar urja ke liye he naa ki parmaanu hathiyaar banane ke liye
 Subsequently in 2015, several countries including the US entered into an agreement with Iran
 iran ke paas kul paanch parmaanu riector hai
 But most of the controversy was about the Busher nuclear plant built with the help of Russia
 kyonki america or isroyal ko shaq tha ki busher parmaanu plant main iran chori-chupe bam parmaanu bana rahaa he, jabaki iran baar-baar duniya ko ye yakeen dilaane kii koshish kar rahaa tha ki parmaanu bijli ghar iran main logon ko urja muhaiyaa karaane ke makasad se banaaya gaya he
 But America and Israel were not ready to accept this
 donon desh is baat par ade the ki iran parmaanu bam bana rahaa he
 France, Germany and Britain began negotiations with Iran in connection with the use of the nuclear plant, raising suspicions of the nuclear plant in the US and Israel
 2006 main america, china or rus bhi is baatcheet main shaamil ho gaye
 Ultimately nine years later in 2015, all countries reached an agreement with Iran
 samjhaute ke tahat iran apane parmaanu plunt kii tay samay seemaa par niyamit jaanch ke liye raji ho gaya taaki ye pataa chal sake ki iran ke parmaanu plant main hathiyaar nahin bana rahaa he
 After this agreement, many restrictions on Iran were lifted
 irani avam main samjhaute se khush the kyonki saalon tak aarthik pratibandh ke chalate iran main khaadya saamagree or dawaaon kii baari kami ho gai thi
 Under the agreement, the responsibility of investigating Iran's nuclear plant was given to the International Atomic Energy Agency, ie IAEA
 antarrashtriya parmaanu urja agency ko har teen maheene main ab report dene ko kaha gaya
 These reports were prepared after an investigation of Iran's nuclear plant
 samjhaute ke baad se ab tak IAEA ne kabhi bhi apni report main iran par parmaanu plant ke galat istemaal ko lekar shaq nahin jataayaa
 Although Israel has been against this agreement since the beginning
 isroyal kaa maananaa he ki iran kaa parmaanu plant duniya ke liye khatra he
 But then US President Barack Obama did not agree with Israel
 lekin donald trump ke aane ke baad isroyal ne phir se is samjhaute ke mudde ko uthaaya
 Because in the 2016 US election, Trump had raised the issue of Iran agreement and called it the worst deal ever
 obama se alag trump kaa rukhsamjhaute ko lekar trump kaa rukh pehle se hi saaf tha
 Therefore, on 8 May 2018, the US abruptly withdrew from the deal
 trump ne iljaam lagaaya ki iran kaa vaada jhootha tha
 In this connection, Trump said, referring to some intelligence documents provided by Israel, that there is strong evidence that Iran has been working to build nuclear weapons
 haalanki IAEA ne america ke is daawey ko kaarij karte hue saaf kaha ki 2009 ke baad se iran main paramanu hathiyaar banane ko lekar kabhi bhi koi saboot nahin mila he
 Not only this, despite America's separation, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany are still with the agreement and are talking about continuing the agreement even further
 iran ne bhi samjhauta jari rakhane kaa elaan kiya he or saath hi is baat par bhi taiyaar ho gaya he ki wo uranium kii maatra simit rakhega
 With this, only energy can be produced for the country and not nuclear weapons
 america drone ko maar giraane ke iran ke kadam ke baad se america lagaataar iran par chadhaai karne kaa mauka dhund rahaa he
 On the other hand, the attitude of Iran is also tough
 lihaaza khatra is baat kaa he ki kahin sachmuch jang shuru naa ho jaae
 In the film's story, Laila, or Kalki, is obsessed with Celebral Pelsey, who lives with her mother, father and younger brother
 kalki kii maa ke kirdaar main hai revati
 Lyla has an interest in music and also writes songs for her music band
 layla kaa kirdaar apni maa ke bahut kareeb hota he jinase wo apana har sukh dukh baantati he
 During the film, what difficulties does Lyla face and what she is looking for in her life, you will have to watch the film
 kahani kii baat karen to 'margarita vid a straw' ek bhaavnaatmak safar he jisase guzarate hue aapako kalki kii bhavanaaen or dard mahasoos hongi
 The film goes on with stagnation and lands very easily
 saath hi is kahani kii sabase acchhee baat ye he ki film main aap layla kii bhaawanaaon ke saath to zarur judenge par layla ko bechaari nahin kahenge
 The comments film kii kahani or dialog kii taareef kerani zaruri he jo kalki yani layla ke kirdaar main sharaarat laate hai or aapke chehre par hansi bhi
 Kalki has played a Qabil-e compliment in the role of Laila
 main jitani taareef karun kam he
 The expected performer Revathi was expected to perform well but he has done better than expected
 sabhi kalakaaron kaa shashakt abhinay parde par nazar aata he
 'margarita with a Straw' has already won many awards abroad and audience appreciation
 to kul milakar is film main tehraav he, isse aap masala filmon jaisi ummiden naa rakhen
 Make the rest of the decision yourself by watching the film
 meri ore se film ko 4 stars
 Talking about the story, 'margarita with a Straw' is an emotional journey through which you will feel the emotions and pain of Kalki
 film tehraav ke saath chalati he or badi aasaani se zehan main utarati he
 Also, the best part of this story is that in the film you will definitely connect with Laila's feelings, but Lyla will not be called poor
 tippaniyan It is necessary to praise the story and dialogue of the film which bring mischief in the character of Kalki i
e
 Lyla and also laugh in your face
 layla ke kirdaar main kalki ne qaabil-e taareef abhinay kiya he
 i praise you less
 manjhi hui kalakaar revati se achche abhinay kii ummid thi par unhone ummid se bhi behatar kaam kiya he
 The strong acting of all the actors is visible on the screen
 'margarita vid a straw' pehle hi videshon main kai awords or darshakon kii saraahna jeet chuki he
 So overall there is a stagnation in this film, so you should not have expectations like masala films
 baaqi faisalaa aap film dekhakar khud karen
 4 stars from my side

 plavan (flotation), utplavak bal (buoyant force), ghanatv (density) or mit centre (meta Center) kya he? inaki paribhaasha kya he
 What is their importance in life
 chaliye jaanate he in sabake bare main
 Buoyant force: The property of a fluid, due to which it exerts an upward force on objects, is called buoyancy or buoyant force
 yah bal vastuon dwaara hataae gaye drav ke gurutv-centre par kaary karata he, jise utplavak centre (center of buoyancy) kehete hai
 It was first studied by Archimedes
 archemides kaa siddhant:jab koi vastu kisi drav main puri athwa aanshik rup se duboi jaati he, to uske bhaar main kami kaa aabhaar hota he
 This virtual decrease in load is equal to the weight of the fluid removed by the object
 plavan (flotation) kaa niyam :(i) santulit avasthaa main tairne par vastu apane bhaar ke baraabar drav visthapit karti hai
 (ii) Both the center of gravity of the solid and the center of gravity of the removed fluid must be in the same vertical line
 ghanatv (density):dravyaman / aaytan iskaa S
 I
 maatrak kilogram meter^-3 hota he
 Relative density: The density of the object is a ratio of the density of water at / 4 ° C
 atah iskaa koi maatrak nahin hota he
 The relative density is measured with a hydrometer
 saamaanya jal kii apeksha samudri jal kaa ghanatv adhik hota he, isliye usamen tairnaa aasaan hota he
 When ice floats in water, 1 / 10 of its volume remains above the water
 kisi bartan main pani bharaa he or us par barf tair rahi he; jab barf puri tarah pigal jaaegi to paatr main pani kaa tal badhata nahin he, pehle ke samaan hi rahata he
 The purity of milk is measured with a lactometer
 mit centre (meta center):tairti hui vastu dwaara visthapit drav ke gurutv-centre ko utplavan-centre kehete hai
 The upward line going from the buoyancy center to the point where the initial upward line going from the center of gravity of the object cuts is called the erase center
 tairne vaali vastu ke sthaayee santulan ke liye sharten:(i) mit centre gurutv-centre ke upar hona chahie
 (ii) Both the center of gravity of the object and the center of gravity of the removed fluid i
e
 the center of buoyancy must both be in the same vertical line

 upabhokta kaa paisa 7 dinon ke bheetar khate main aa jayega

 BJP Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, while targeting the Congress at an election rally in Delhi, said that the 'non-destructive' rulers of the Center and Delhi are not giving the account of their rule to the people, but the public has got from them in elections- Will take account of the pie
 modi ne chunavi sabha main kaha, congress ke anhakaari shaasha janata ko apane kaam kaa hisaab nahin de rahe hai
 
 
 But they are demanding accounts from the Gujarat government
 aisa karnaa congress ke netaaon kaa fishan ban gaya he
 Elections are in Delhi and Rajasthan, but the answers are demanding from the Gujarat government
 gujarat main kathith rup se unke kehane par ek yuvati kii 'avaidh' jasusi karne ke maamle kaa sidhaa ullekh kiye bina unhone kaha ki congress isse pehle gujarat chunaav ke dauraan bhi unhen badnaam karne ke kai prayaas kar chuki he, lekin use munh kii khaani padi
 Modi said, he (congress) did all the tricks to discredit me, but Gujarati people defeated those efforts
 fasebuk or twitor ke jariye aarope lagaae jane ke baavjood gujarat ne congress ko karaara jawaab diya
 At this rally in Shahdara, where a large number of people from Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh live, Modi said, if there would have been development in Bihar and UP in the last 60 years, would the people there leave their home families and work in Delhi Come? a large number of people from Odisha, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh also live in Surat (gujarat), but have received the honor of a city with good maintenance
 modi ne pradhanmantri manmohan singh or vittamantri pi chidambaram par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, main manmohan singh ji ke arthshaastri hone par koi coment nahin karata hum, vittamantri bhi jaankaar hai, ham unki jaankaree ko bhi chalange nahin karte hai, lekin in logon ne desh ko dubo diya he ki nahin
 
 
 Modi alleged that the intention of the Congress was not clear for the poor
 modi ne kaha, kaamanwealth ke ghotaalon ne yamuna paar rahane waalon ko kalankit kiya he
 This government is badly involved in corruption
 tel kii keemton main badhotaree kiye jane par centre sarkaar kii chaaron ore se ho rahi aalochana ke bich congress ne shanivaar ko bachaav kii mudra main aate hue kaha ki aisa usne majaburi vash kiya he kyonki koi bhi sarkaar alokapriy nahin hona chaahati he
 Congress General Secretary Jardan Dwivedi told reporters, "there must have been some compulsions
" koi bhi sarkaar alokapriy nahin hona chaahati he
 In fact, there was a strike in Left-ruled West Bengal and Kerala on Saturday to protest the rise in oil prices
 eendhan kii keemton main badhotaree ke mudde par jad (you) dwaara samooche vipaksh ko iske virodh main ekajute hokar ‘bharat band’ karne kii apil kiye jane ke baad dvivedi kii yah tippanee ai he
 a senior party leader said, "the Council of Ministers must have considered all aspects before taking a decision
" ’ baharhaal, party ke sutron ne is baat se inkaar kar diya ki aktubar-november maheene main sambhavit bihar vidhansabha ke chunaav main mahangaai ke chunavi mudda banane kii sambhaavna he
 The effect of sealing in the capital Delhi is visible even till the Holi meet
 dilli congress ke adhyaksh ajay maakan buudhvaar ko ek aise hi kaarykram main shirkat karne pahunche the, lekin yahaan unhen naaraaz vyapaariyon ke sawaalon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In the Holi Milan ceremony organized by traders in Paharganj, after the reception of the three party leaders on the stage, the traders asked questions about sealing
 is dauraan congress netaa ajay maakan ne kaha ki wo isi pahadganj ilaake main paley bade hai
 In such a situation, these traders are serious about questions
 ajay maakan ne vyapaariyon ko ek nakshaa dete hue kaha ki agar aage se ceiling cameti kii koi team yahaan aae to unhen majbootee se bataanaa hogi ki yah ilaaka special jone main he or yahaan par ceiling nahin ho sakati he
 At the same time, special Ravi, MLA from Aam Aadmi Party said that the Aam Aadmi Party is continuously demonstrating about the concern of businessmen
 unhone kaha ki ab koi team yahaan par karrwai karne aegi to vah us par karrwai karenge
 On the other hand, Babita, a local corporator present at the event as a BJP representative, said that she was serious about this issue and had met the LG regarding sealing
 baharhaal, kaarykram keyojakon kaa kehnaahai ki netaaon ke aashwaasan ke baad wo holi manaayenge lekin netaaon ko apane vaade yaad rakhane chahien
 But one thing is clear, sealing has thrown the color of the traders this time

 On the other hand, the Knightriders batting will be around captain Gautam Gambhir, Brendon mccullum and Jack Kallis

 Spinner Sunil Narayan is bowling well at the moment

 perth test main mili haar or tamaam aalochanaon ke bich 'viraat brigade' boxing de test match ke liye taiyaar he
 a win in Melbourne is a must to win the series
 captain viraat kohli or coach ravi shastri dabaav main hai
 The play is over at the playing XI

 Young batsman Mayank Agarwal will wear a test cap
 unhen hanuma vihari ke saath pari kii shuruyaat karne kaa mauka milegaa
 So with the new openers, the trajectory of Team India is not going to be easy
 australia main team india ab tak koi test siries jeet pai he or na hi boxing de par koi test match jeeta he
 In such a situation, the pressure on the captain and the coach is natural
 edilade main jeet ke baad kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki shaayad is baar bhartiya team 71 saal ke itihaas ke baad australian dharti par test siries jeetne main kaamyaab ho sakati he
 Because Team India was looking strong under Kohli's captaincy and the absence of Steve Smith and David Warner made the Kangaroo team's batting look very weak
 lekin perth test main kangaroo gendbaajon ke saamne bhartiya ballebaaji aise ladkadai, jisaki ummid nahin thi
 However, the series is on par with 1-1
 melbern main jo team jeetegi, usase yah saaf ho jayega ki wo siries nahin haare vaali he
 In this match, the Australian will take the field with increased morale
 vahiin, team india par kai tarah kaa dabaav honge
 Captain Kohli's strategy and selection of playing eleven were attributed to the defeat in the second Test match
 iske alaava team india kii sabase badi pareshaani opening jodi rahi, jo lagaataar fail ho rahi thi
 In Melbourne, captain Kohli has played a bet on the new opening pair, who will undergo a litmus test on the Melbourne pitch
 is opening jodi ke saamne 15-20 over khilne or pachaas ran se zyada kii partnership dene kaa dabaav rahegaa
 Because in Test cricket, the role of openers is very important for any team to score 300 or 400
 australia, england, south africa or newjiland jaise deshon main bhartiya team ke kharaab pradarshan ke peeche opebers kii naakaami rahi he
 The way to victory in Melbourne derives from the success of the openers batsmen
 2010 yani aath saal pehle south africa ke centurian main bhartiya team kii purv salaami jodi rahe virendra sahvaag or gautam gambhir ne duusari pari main pehle wicket ke liye 137 ranon kii saajhedaari kii thi
 After that series, the Indian opening pair in Australia, New Zealand, England, and South Africa have come on the field 62 times in total, including 21
 03 kii ausat ke saath sarvaadhik score 63 ran kaa rahaa he
 Apart from this, Indian openers have crossed the 50 mark just seven times
 aise main melbern main mayank agarwal or hanuma vihari par chautarafa dabaav rahegaa

 Call it coincidence or something

 Her husband bypasses the honor
 isliye yah kaha jaataa he ki sindur lanbaa or aise lagaaein ki sabhi ko dikhe ki yah sindur maathe se lagaana aarambh karke or jitani lambii maang ho utana bharaa janaa chahie
 If there is vermilion in demand among the woman and the vermilion takes too long, then the life of her husband is long

 jaraa is paridrishy par gaur karen: ek asli tej gendbaaj apane ran-ap ke chor par khadaa he
 Tall-bodied, painted white on the face; He starts running, his hands and feet moving in a rhythm, with speed
 yah vah daraavna najaara he jo achche-achche ballebaajon ko raatbhar chaiyn se sone nahin detaa
 They keep on thinking about how they will face the bowler the next morning
 ab jaraa krij par khadey sachin kii tasviir dekhen
 His height of 5 feet 5 inches looks quite small
 unka balla of
 Is in line with the stump
 unki saumy nazren helmet ke peeche se jhaank rahi hai
 Surprisingly, these gentle eyes have been creating fear in the hearts of fast bowlers across the world for two decades
 sachin main aisa kya he jisase nipatna gendbaajon ke liye bada du:swapn ban jaataa he? gendbaajon ko samaj main nahin aata tha ki ve sachin ko kisi gend karen, jisase ve unke street drive, cover drive or gend ko balle se chhukar seemaa ke paar pahunch jane se batch saken
 How difficult was it really to bowl against him? Waqar Younis, who threw a bouncer on his face in the fourth Test of Sachin's first series in Sialkot, says the incident was not presented to the public properly
 pakistan ke purv captain ne india today ko bataaya, ''pehali baat, main nahin samajhataa ki gend utani jor se unhen lagi thi, jitani bayaan kii jaati rahi he
 i was throwing the ball at a speed of 145 kmph
 lekin vah dastaane se takaraakar sachin ke chehre par lag gai
 they sat down
 hamane aapas main baat kii, haath milaayaa or ek minute ke bheetar ve khilne ke liye khadey ho gaye
 Waqar says that incident was given a big shape
 1989 ke daure se pehle bharat ke under-19 daure ke samay pakistani team ne ajay jadeja se 16 saal ke jis ladke ke bare main suna tha, usne dobaaraa apane upar kisi gendbaaj ko haaavee nahin hone diya
 "I remember that we did not worry too much about him in our first team meeting," he said
 ham to krishnamachari shrikant, mohammad ajaharuddin, kapil dev or manoj prabhakar jaise ahm khiladinnon ke bare main soch rahe the
 But by the end of the tour, our opinion about Sachin had changed completely
 ”agle kuch varshon main jab bharat or pakistan niyamit rup se ekadivasiy match khilne lage to pakistan ke dressing room main sari baatcheet kaa mudda yahi hota tha ki sachin ko kaise thama jaae
 "we had understood that if we did not get them out in the first few overs, they could do us a lot of damage
" ”vakaar kehete hai ki sachin ke khel main koi khaas kamajori nahin thi, jiskaa phayda uthaaya ja sake, or vakt ke saath unki ballebaaji or bhi nikharati chali gai, ''ek tenge gendbaaj ke taur par aap kisi ballebaaj ko ek hi pattern par alag-alag tarah kii genden phenkate hai or use galati karne ke liye majaboor karte hai
 Of all the batsmen i have bowled against so far, Sachin was the best to read that pattern
 lekin maine hameshaa mahasoos kiya he ki sachin ko pari kii shuruyaat main tej raftaar se apni ore aati gendon ko khilne main kuch had tak mushkil hoti thi
 "another great bowler of the 1990s, Alan Donald, had heard so much about Sachin before India's tour of South Africa in 1997 that he consulted West Indies fast bowlers Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh, as they both got Sachin
 Ko was lbw several times
 ve kehete hai, ''aam taur par tej gendbaaj apane rahasy kisi ko nahin bataate, lekin ve jaanate the ki main kiske khilaaf khilne ja rahaa tha
 So, while showing goodness, he gave me the necessary information about Sachin's game
 ”ambros or walsh ne donald ko bataaya ki ve sachin ko shuru main hi puri lambaai kii genden daalen or unhen khilne ke liye majaboor karen
 He told that Sachin stands at the crease comfortably and drops the balls that he does not want to play
 donald ke shabdon main, ''unhone salaah di ki main unhen phul length or of stump ke baahar tirchhi genden phenkun
 The advice came in handy but only once
 sachin test siries main ek bada shatak lagane main kaamyaab rahe
 Donald was dismissed only once in three Test matches
 sachin kaa kariyar 1990 ke dashak ke madhya main jab teji se aage bad rahaa tha to har gendbaaj ke liye sabase mushkil kaam yah hota tha ki unke khilaaf kis tarah kii taiyaari kii jaae
 Shoaib Akhtar of Pakistan says, he knew that he would have to watch Sachin separately from the rest of the players
 ''maine kabhi bhi sachin ke saath gaali-galouj nahin kii
 There are some players who are better left out
 ve aise khilaadi hai jo tyoriyon kaa jawaab zyada jor se balla chalaakar dete hai
 "rawalpindi Express" Akhtar started his Test career in a dramatic manner in 1999 by dismissing Rahul Dravid and Sachin off two consecutive balls
 akhtar kehete hai, unhen yah sweekaar karne main koi sankoch nahin he ki sachin ke khilaaf unki zyaadaatar yojanaayen vifal rahi hai
 "I used to think, if i do such a ball, they will play like this, and then i will get a chance to get out
" 2003 ke vishwa cap main maine unhen yah sochakar of stump ke baahar short pich gend phenkane kii koshish kii ki ve gend ko pul karenge
 But they picked him up from the point and gave him a six
 is shot ne unhen mashhoor kar diya tha
 "then i decided to bowl on his body," Akhtar laughs
 lekin unhone meri gend ko flik kar diya
 i bowled a full length ball, they played it straight
 ” ve isi tarah gendbaajon kii lay bigaad diya karte the
 Javagal Srinath, who has probably bowled the most against Sachin in the net and in domestic cricket, says that while bowling against Sachin, you should keep your mind going all the time
 agar aapane pehle se koi yojana banaai he, to ve use kabhi kaamyaab nahin hone denge
 If you can't stop them, then the game will be out of your hands
 shrinath kehete hai, ''main dakshin africa ke tej gendbaaj pheni di williars ko jaanata hum jo sachin se ek kadam aage soch sakate the or unhen hameshaa out karne main kaamyaab rahete the
 "srinath, who has played with Sachin for more than a decade, says that Sachin knew the tricks of the bowlers so well that he kept telling the batsman at the other end what the bowler was going to throw the next time
 unke shabdon main, ''sachin bataate rahete the, ab yah upar daalega yaa thodaa chota maaregaa
 His guess was 90 percent correct
 ”beshak, sachin main kai kamajoriyaan bhi thim
 But they used to overcome those weaknesses
 apni isi khubi kii vajah se dusron ke mukaable hameshaa aage rahete the
 He showed this quality by scoring 241 runs in Sydney during his tour of Australia in 2003-04
 ballebaaji kii yahi to kala he ki aap apni majbootiyon kaa phayda uthaaen or kamajoriyon ko zyada se zyada dur karen
 This art has made a player of short stature sit on the peak of cricket in the world

 Tharoor, who was a minister in the previous UPA government and was elected a Lok Sabha member for the second time from Thiruvananthapuram, has commented on Facebook, 'if anyone calls me a BJP supporter, i would be surprised

 ' unhone likhaa, 'bhaajapa netaaon ke vishesh bayanon yaa gatividhiyon ko sweekaar karne kaa matlab party ke hindutv ke agenda ko sweekaar karnaa nahin he
 The Prime Minister made his appeal as non-political and i accepted it in the same spirit

 In short, i am not a supporter of BJP, only a supporter of India

 kashmir se jude samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 ke do khandon ko khatm kar dene ke saath hi us bahucharchit anuchhed 35 e ko bhi raashtrapati ke aadesh se khatm kar diya gaya he, jiske mutabik desh ke baaki rajyon ke logon ko vahaan jameen kharidne kaa adhikaar nahin tha
 This article has been considered discriminatory, but the country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had expressed many doubts about its removal
 nehru kaa maananaa tha ki aisa hua to kashmir par desh ke anya hisson ke amiron kaa kabja ho jayega
 Nehru had said in the Lok Sabha that it was a good rule, in fact, this rule was from the era of Dogra rulers in Kashmir
 iske alaava tathy yah bhi he ki baaki rajyon ke nagarikon ko jameen kharidne se rokane kaa niyam himachal pradesh, arunachal pradesh, andaman-nicobar main bhi lagu he
 Similarly in Uttarakhand, outsiders are prohibited from buying land
 vaise kashmir ke is niyam kaa virodh bhi aazaadee ke baad shuruuaat se hi hone laga tha
 According to Ashok Pandey's book 'kashmir Nama', Nehru said in the Lok Sabha, 'this is not a new thing, but an old rule that is going on and i think it is a very good thing and it should continue , Because Kashmir is a very breathtaking place and (if this rule is repealed) it will be unfortunate for the residents here that rich people will buy all the land here
 yah vaastavik kaaran he or yah kaaran angrejon ke jamaane se, sau saal se adhik varshon se lagu he
 'significantly, after the abolition of the special status that Kashmir is getting, now the locals are afraid that outsiders will come there and start buying land and settle in large numbers
 isaki vajah se bhartiya janata party ke sthaneey netaa centre sarkaar se domissile jaisi kadi vyavastha laane kaa suzav de rahe hai
 BJP leaders say that by changing this rule the private sector in the state will be able to buy land easily and industries will get a boost
 unako ummid he ki is niyam ke hatane kaa kisi bhi tarah kaa durupyog nahin hoga or jameen ke maalikon kaa hit barkaraar rahegaa
 The Modi government has taken a historic decision regarding Kashmir
 somvaar ko grahamantri amit shah ne sadan main anuchhed 370 hataane kaa sankalp sadan main pesh kiya
 He said that only Section 1 will remain in Article 370 applicable in Kashmir, the remaining provisions will be removed
 iske alaava nae praavdhaan main jammu-kashmir punargathan kaa prastaav bhi shaamil he
 Under it, Jammu and Kashmir will now be a union territory and Ladakh has been separated from Jammu and Kashmir
 artical 35A kya tha?artical 35A samvidhan main shaamil ek praavdhaan tha jiske dwaara jammu-kashmir vidhanmandal ko yah adhikaar pradaan kiya gaya tha ki vah yah tay kare ki jammu or kashmir kaa sthaayee nivasee koun he or kise saarvajanik kshetra kii naukariyon main vishesh aarakshan diya jaayegaa, kise sampatti kharidne kaa adhikaar hoga, kise jammu-kashmir vidhansabha chunaav main vot daalane kaa adhikaar hoga, chaatravrutti tathaa anya saarvajanik sahaayta or kise saamaajik kalyaan kaaryakramon kaa laabh milegaa

 Manik Sarkar is the Chief Minister in Tripura since 1998
 tripura vidhansabha chunaav main wo paanchaven kaarykaal kii ummid main left front kii ore se mukhyamantri pad kaa cheharaa hai
 Let me tell you that since 1993, before the Manik Sarkar became the CM of Tripura, the Left Front government has been continuously formed
 tripura main vidhansabha chunaav prachaar ke raftaar pakadaney ke saath hi bijepi ke kendriya netaa yahaan tabadatod daure kar rahe hai
 At the same time, 69-year-old Manik Sarkar has targeted the BJP, accusing it of doing petty politics
 mukhyamantri maanik sarkaar ne bijepi par vot hasil karne ke liye bade paimaane par dhanabal ke istemaal kaa bhi aarope lagaaya he
 According to Manik Sarkar, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, at his rally in Agartala, presented incorrect facts about Tripura
 india today se exclusive intervyuu main maanik sarkaar ne kaha, ‘mujhe chunauti kaa saamana karne or tripura par focus hota dekh acha lag rahaa he
 There is no tension on the election but i am surprised by the focus on Tripura this time
 ’rajya main anti inkambency factor nahimanik sarkaar ne daawa kiya ki rajya main anti inkambency (satta virdohi rujhaan) jaisi koi baat nahin he
 He said, 'our government has consistently delivered
 is sarkaar kaa record bedaag he or isane logon ke hit main kadam uthaae hai
 The bjp's nexus with the IPFT, demanding a separate state, led the BJP to join hands with the 'indigenous People's Front of Tripura' (IPFT)
 maanik sarkaar ne kaha, ‘IPFT kii maang alag rajya kii he or is par kyon vichaar kiya ja rahaa he kendriya grih mantri ise saport kar rahe hai? kya kaaran he ki ek raajnneetik dal aise logon se mil rahaa he
 To spread clutter under an issue or in a state
 kedra sarkaar yaa raajnneetik dal kaise aise sanghathan se sathganth kar rahaa he?’maanik sarkaar ne puure vishwaas ke saath yahi sanket diya ki bijepi kii daal tripura main galane vaali nahin he
 The Chief Minister said, 'we are united and will not allow any force to polarize or divide our state
 jab tak left front kaa paracham tripura main fahraa rahaa he, koi bhi shakti rajya ko baantne main kaamyaab nahin hogi
 BJP is trying to make a place at the cost of the Congress where the opportunists are full and who are changing the ground
 inamen se kai bijepi main shaamil ho gaye hai
 'the fight is not PM vs CM but RSS-BJP in Sekya Tripura is PM vs CM? In response to this question, the Chief Minister said, 'I can say that this election is only a form of the political battle we are fighting with the RSS and BJP
 ise nijee ladaai ke taur par kaise pesh kiya ja saktaa he
 'attempting to tarnish my image Manik Sarkar on political murders and allegations of increasing crime said in retaliation that the campaign to tarnish his image has been launched
 maanik sarkaar ne saath hi krime record beuro kaa hawala diya
 He said, 'it is connected with the Center and the Ministry of Home Affairs, so they should follow the data of this bureau
 hamane aparaadh record ko ghataya he phir ye kaise negative ho saktaa he
 This is a positive development
 rajya main ugravad kii samasya par kaabo paa liya gaya he
 On the recent Agartala visit of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, accused of using false facts on Rajnath, Manik Sarkar said, 'leaders should not lie, elections keep on coming
 in netaaon kii ore se bole gaye shabd kaayam rahete hai or log unhen yaad rakhte hai
 Manik Sarkar accused Home Minister Rajnath Singh that he used wrong facts and words during his visit to Agartala
 centre se rajya ko milane vaale paise kaa istemaal nahin kiye jane sambandhi aarope par maanik sarkaar ne kaha, ‘hamen centre se paisa nahin mil rahaa, hamaare khate paardarshee hai
 The impression of Central Government officials is also clear
 paisa aakhri hafte main relies kiya gaya
 The election process is to be completed by March, so the money could not be used
 
 
 
 But the facts are being distorted
 maanik sarkaar ne bijepi par tripura chunaav main behatahasha paisa kharch karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Manik Sarkar said, 'who does not know how BJP is spending crores of rupees in elections
 aam chunaav main unhone 15,000 karod kharch kiya tha
 This was in the media and he never denied it
 unhone kabhi garibon ke liye koi kadam nahin uthaaya lekin corporates ke zarur achche din aa gaye
 They are trying to do the same in Tripura but the people of the state are very alert
 yahaan wo logon ko kharidne main samarth nahin honge
 'the government should bear the expenses of elections
 The local government advocated the idea of going to the government to raise the election expenses
 unhone kaha, ‘chunavi kharch kaa paisa sarkaar se aana chahie naa ki corporates ke yahaan se
 BJP is working for the benefit of corporators
 ab wo ek chote se rajya main dilchaspee dikhaa rahe hai, isiilie wo ham par hamalaa kar rahe hai
 In fact, people will feel that we are the biggest force of opposition even at the center
 in partiyon ke napak gathjod ke khilaaf tripura mashaal uthayega
 Manik Sarkar also alleged that the central government is running on the instructions of RSS and VHP
 college ke dinon se hi kar rahaa hum yogakya aap yoga karte hai, is sawaal ke jawaab menmanik sarkaarne kaha, ‘haa, main roj yoga karata hum or ye main college ke dinon se hi karata aa rahaa hum, jisase ki apane jivan main anushaasan sunishchit kiya ja sake

 It is ironic that Congress leader Shashi Tharoor lost the post of party spokesperson
 un par kathith rup se us shaks kii tarif karne kaa aarope tha, jisane thik do saal pehle unki patni sunanda pushkar ko 50 karod ru
 Said girlfriend
 lekin party ke bheetar dabe sur main bataaya ja rahaa he ki tharur ko hataane ke peeche asli vajah pradhanmantri narendra modi ke prati upja prem nahin, balki ames ke doctoron kii vah report he, jisamen dilli ke ek hotel main 17 janvari ko pushkar kii maut kaa kaaran jehar bataaya gaya he
 The report also stated that bruises were found on his body
 congress ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke ek kareebi ke mutabik, tiruvanantpuram se saansad tharur kii pravaktaa pad se barkhaastagi is baat kii bhi pushti karti he ki rahul ''dhire-dhire khamoshi" ke saath party kii svachh chhavi banane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 This was not the first time that Tharoor had praised Modi
 3 june ko, hafington post ke sampadakeey main unhone kaha tha ki modi ne jis tarah se khud ko ''nafrat kaa paatr samajhe jane vaale vyakti se badalakar aadhuniktaa or vikaas ke avatar" ke taur par sthapit kiya he, use agar congress sweekaar nahin karti he to yah puri tarah ninsaphi hogi
 Then on September 27, Tharoor tweeted Modi's speech in the United Nations (UN), the essence of which was: "indian Prime Minister's strong speech
 loktantr or paryaavaran kaa samarthan, aatankwaad kaa virodh
 Great answer to Pakistan
 " modi-tharur ke is prakaran main aakhri padaav thi pradhanmantri kii ore se gandhi jayanti ke maukey par 2 aktubar ko shuru unke svachh bharat abhiyaan main tharur ko aamantrit karnaa, jise congress ke is saansad ne khushi-khushi kabool bhi kar liya
 But the party remained silent and the next day after the report of Pushkar's death was made public, on 10 October, there was a demand from Kerala Congress to take action against Tharoor
 congress ke andruni sutron ke anusaar, rahul nahin chaahate the ki tharur ke kaaran party ko ek baar phir shamadagi kaa saamana karnaa pade
 He conveyed his opinion to Congress President Sonia Gandhi, who presided over the disciplinary committee A
 ke
 Asked Antony to find a solution
 apana pad bachaane kii tharur kii aakhri koshish vifal rahi, kyonki ve sonia yaa rahul se nahin mil sake
 a Congress general secretary recalls his meeting with Sonia soon after Antony submitted a report on the results of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in August, describing how Rahul is now gradually taking full control of the party
 Huh
 ve bataate hai, congress adhyaksh ek pareshaan maa lag rahi thim
 More than her defeat in the elections and her report, she was worried about the growing discontent among party workers against Rahul
 sonia ne mulaakaat ke ant main apane bharosemand sahyogi se kaha ki rahul party kaa bhavishya hai or ve hameshaa ke liye yah jimmedaari nahin sambhaal sakati hai
 Therefore, Rahul should be given a free hand in the reconstruction work on behalf of the party
 lekin congress ke is netaa, jo party kii sarvocch niti nirdharak sanstha varking cameti (seedblusi) ke sadsy bhi hai, ko us vakt bahut tajjub hua, jab sonia ne kaha ki unki tarah party ke duusare varisht netaaon ko bhi ab peeche hat janaa chahie
 This became clear when Ahmed Patel, the political secretary of Congress President Sonia Gandhi, started spending most of his time in research on the history of the Northeast
 purv vitt mantri pi
 Chidambaram, former Defense Minister A
 ke
 While many Congress leaders, including Antony and former Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde, prepared themselves for the inevitable political retirement by getting a hint of Sonia, Digvijay Singh and Janardan Dwivedi started resorting to media to protest
 mana ja rahaa he ki digvijay or janardan, donon ko mahasachiv pad se hataaya ja saktaa he
 Meanwhile, away from the eyes of the media, Team Rahul kept on thinking how to make the party stand again
 haalanki rahul gandhi philhal pratyaksh rup se kisi jaldbaaji main nahin dikhaai dete
 a leader close to him says, "there is no master plan to re-create the party
" haalanki antni samiti kii report pesh kar di gai he, lekin haryana or maharashtra ke chunavi nateezon ke baad bhi kisi bade badlaav kii ummid nahin kerani chahie
 "A clear indication is that the Congress vice-president is not going to change his style of work despite the crushing defeat in the general elections
 yah baat isi se pataa chalati he ki saal ke ant tak congress kii pradesh samitiyon ko block str par chunaav karaane ke liye ve patr bhej chuke hai
 Another aide of Rahul says, "due to political compulsions, many of his decisions were earlier altered
 lekin ab kisi tarah kaa samajhaita nahin kiya jayega
 "and despite widespread criticism in party circles, the think tank of Kanishka Singh, Mohan Gopal, Sachin Rao and Kaushal Vidyarthi is set to remain intact
 aglaa bada badlaav yah hone ja rahaa he ki pradeshon main netritv kaa ek nayaa dhaancha banaaya jayega, jo junior kaaryakartaaon se milane vaali jaankariyon par aadhaarit hoga
 Encouraged by the success of Sachin Pilot in Rajasthan, youth leaders will now be made the chairman of the Pradesh Congress Committee in many states
 rahul ke ek sahyogi ke mutabik, rajyon main saaf-suthri chhavi vaale yuva netaa taiyaar karne kii yojana banaai ja rahi he
 It is well known that Rahul does not like coalition politics
 unka maananaa he ki party ko upie kii sahyogi partiyon ke galat or avaanchit kaamon ke kaaran bhi loksabhaa chunaavon main haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 So when Sharad Pawar's NCP threatened to break the alliance before the Maharashtra elections, he refused to negotiate despite Sonia's opposition
 mana ja rahaa he ki agle saal party bihar samet sabhi rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaavon main akele hi chunaav lard sakati he
 But the biggest lesson that the Congress has learned from the defeat of the Lok Sabha elections is the power of social media, which was used by BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a very effective manner
 congress mahasachiv ajay maakan ke netritv main congress kii sanchaar team ne ab aise shodhakartaaon kii team niyukït kii he, jo har roj dopaher baad 3 baje or shaam 8 baje baithken yojit karti he
 She prepares "a spice of contest" for party spokespersons and leaders such as party leaders in both houses of parliament, Mallikarjun Kharge in the Lok Sabha and Ghulam Nabi Azad in the Rajya Sabha to take on the NDA government
 ab bada sawaal yah he ki kya rahul kii ranneeti party ke liye kargar ho paaegi? haalanki unki ranneeti prishthbhumi main aakaar lene lagi he
 But the party's big leaders, who are not involved in strategy making, are not satisfied
 congress ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ''ham bahut samay se un badlaavon kii baat sunate aa rahe hai

 The speed of trains decreases due to fog

 Fog wreaks havoc in the winter
 Those who drive during the fog face a lot of problems

 Driving in a headlight high-beam is considered against the traffic rule, there is also a provision for fine

 Apart from this, driving at high speed in the fog means an accident, so it would be better to drive at a lower speed than the speed limit
 kohre main baar-baar len badalanaa haadase kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 Driving Hazard Light Turning on, some people are driving during the fog by turning on the Hazard Light (both indicators on), which is totally wrong

 jaaniye, aakhir bhartiya raajnneeti or khud ke bare main kya raay rakhti hai sonia gandhi
 
 
 
 
 Public speaking, not very comfortable Public speaking is not very easy for UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi
 yah baat unhone march 2018 main mumbai main yojit india today conklev ke 17wein sanskaran main khud kaha tha
 He had said, 'public speaking is not very comfortable for me
 lihaaja main padhane main zyada samay detii hum
 Now i am in the party as a normal Congress worker
 'unhone kaha tha aaj desh main sansadeey niyamon kaa paalan nahin ho rahaa
 The government is responsible for the uproar in Parliament
 sonia gandhi ne kaha tha ki wo desh se poochna chaahati hai ki kya may 2014 main piem modi ke satta main aane se pehle desh ek blueole tha or sirf is taarikh ke baad hi desh ne sab kuch kiya
 The frenzied statement by the ruling government, Sonia Gandhi had said, "frenzied statements are being made deliberately on behalf of the ruling government and its consequences will be in front of us
" vartmaan samay main khud ke vishay main sochane par bhi hamalaa kiya ja rahaa he
 Efforts are being made to increase religious tension

 In such a situation what happened to the India we wanted to build? We need to walk fast, but not so fast that large population is left behind
 'notebandi ne arthvyavastha ko peeche dhakel diyasonia gandhi kaha ki maximum government kaa kya matlab he, jab desh main logon ko naukari nahin di ja sakati he

 With this, the Congress had to beat the marketing in front of Narendra Modi
 sonia ne kaha tha ki congress ko aam aadmi se conect karne ke liye ek nae style kii jarurat he
 Along with this, the Congress needs to present its programs and possibilities in a new way
 atal bihari vaajapeyi behatar netaa theindia today conklevake manch se sonia ne kaha tha, 'hamen sansad main bolne nahin diya ja rahaa
 The Modi government runs away from discussing important issues in Parliament

 After the BJP PM candidate Narendra Modi's request to stop the use of slogans of 'har Har Har Modi' by the workers in his eulogy, a verse associated with Maa Durga in Varanasi has also been Modiized
 bijepi sahitya evam prakaashan prakoshth kii ore se jari ek poster main maa durga kii puja karte vakt padhe jane vaale shloke ko varanasi se chunaav lard rahe modi ke mafik banane kii koshish kii gai he
 Wishing the arrival of Navratri is written in the poster with the photo of Modi
 
 
 'yaa modi sarvbhooteshu rashtraroopen sansthit:, namastasyai, namastasyai, namastasyai namo nam:
 'shloka read for Maa Durga according to experts' or Goddess Sarvabhuteshu Matruroopane Sanstha: Namastasai, Namastasai, Namastasai Namo Namah:' The verse literally composed by Modi's supporters literally means
 
 
 modi jo raashtra ke rup main har manushya main nivas karte hai, unhen baar-baar naman
 It is worth noting that the slogan 'har-har Namo', given by bjp's provincial president Laxmikant Bajpai at Modi's rally in Varanasi on 20 December last year, was later changed to 'har-har Modi'
 is par vivaad hone ke baad modi ne khud ek twit karke netaaon or kaaryakartaaon se is naare se parhez kii guzarish kii thi
 Meanwhile, Ashok Chaurasia, convener of the BJP Literature and Publication Cell's Kashi area, clarified that there has been no tampering of the actual verse associated with Maa Durga
 darasal narendra modi ke prati logon kii bhaawanaaon ko jaahir karne ke liye yah nayaa shloke banaaya gaya he
 He said that the poster issued by us reflects our own view and not that of BJP
 hamaara maananaa he ki pradhanmantri ke rup main modi bhartiya arthvyavastha ko majboot karenge or bhartiya simaaon kii suraksha karenge
