 jo log ucch jati ke hinduon ke reeti-rivaajon ko chunauti dena chaahate the, unhone mahasoos kiya ki unhen is disha main sanbhalkar aage baduya chahie
 Gandhiji even started by acknowledging that untouchability is wrong but at the same time he said that inter-caste communion and inter-caste marriage are also wrong
 iske baad unhone is disha main aage badhate hue antarjaateey meljol or antarjaateey bhoj ko sweekaar kar liya tha
 He argued that all the characters are the same
 sabase aakhri or sabase bada kadam 1946 main uthaaya gaya tha jisamen antarjaateey vivaah ko sweekaar karte hue sidhe taur par jati pratha ko chunauti di gai thi

 But a poet in independent India has written that the whole nature has been divided on communal basis
 bangaluru main yojit ek samaaroh main saiyad ahamed javed jaafaree ne kisi kii ek kavita padhi, jisaki kuch panktiyaan soshal media par viral ho gai hai jo is prakaar hai—nafaraton kaa asar dekho, jaanwaron kaa bantwaaraa ho gayagay hindu ho gai or bakra musalmaan ho gayaaye ped, ye pattey, ye shakhen bhi pareshaan ho jaengar parinde bhi hindu or musalmaan ho jaaensukhey mewa bhi yah dekhakar pareshaan ho gaye, na jane kab nariyal hindu aurakhjur musalmaan ho gaejis tarah se dharm rangon ko bhi baante ja rahe hai, ki haraa musalmaan kaa he aurlaal hinduon kaa rang haito wo din bhi dur nahin jab sari kii sari subjiyan musalamaanon kii ho jaaengi or hinduon ke hisse bas gaajar or tamaato hi aaengrub samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki tarbooz kiske hisse jayega, ye to bechaara upar se musalmaan or andar se hindu rah jayega

 The documentary film Cast on the Menu Card made by students of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences was banned at the Jeevika Film Festival by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
 vajahah is film main "bif'' shabd kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 The film begins with poignant lines in the Madiga poetry collection of a Telugu-language Dalit poet: the beef that i have eaten since the time of the umbilical cord, the flesh that has become the bone of my bones, the meat that has been part of my blood, when You drove me out of the village, when you found my footprints untouchable, when you did not consider me even human, who supported me and gave me Even brought it, that beef was when you brag while bragging, Your ancestors used to drink ghee, we used to exploit us
 Beef was with us when milk was extracted by pressing its udder, then you did not feel his pain
 When you wore his leather slippers, you did not suffer at all when his skinned drum was your weddings and last
 At the rites, you did not feel hurt at all and when it eradicated my hunger, the cow became your goddess
 It is felt that Hinduism is in danger, Hindus need to agitate to save their religion, and cow is a sacred symbol for Hindus

 Then he not only lost the Lok Sabha elections but the angry Congress refused to give him a ministerial post even after he entered the Rajya Sabha
 lekin yah bhi unke liye phaayde kii baat rahi kyonki isse 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon se ain pehle narendra modi ke netritv vaali bhaajapa ke saath galabahiyaan daalane ke raste khul gaye
 Paswan has demonstrated an amazing ability to see the future from the beginning
 yuva paswan ko police upaadheekshak ke pad ke liye chunaa gaya tha, lekin unhone naukari nahin kii, jise tab bahut surakshit mana jaataa tha
 Turned to politics in 1969
 ve 1969 main bihar vidhansabha chunaav lade or jite
 He then won his first Lok Sabha election as a Lok Dal candidate in 1977
 tab se unhone logon ko dost banane main lachak dikhaai he
 His friends first admire his ability to read the writing on the wall
 yahaan tak ki unke katu aalochakon ke paas bhi unke khilaaf kehane ko zyada kuch nahin hota he
 After the recommendations of the Paswan Mandal Commission came into force, the then Prime Minister V
 pi
 Singh stood alongside and emerged as a Dalit icon
 in varshon main ve lokdal se janata dal main gaye or phir apni party banaai
 Yet to a large extent, due to his committed voters, he has remained indispensable in the politics of Bihar
 gathbandhan kii raajnneeti kaa daur phala-phula to iskaa sabase zyada phayda paswan ne uthaaya
 He also took full advantage of every opportunity in politics amidst the exercise to cultivate his secular image with full understanding
 unhone 2002 ke gujarat dangon ke baad vaajapeyi sarkaar ko alavida kah diya
 Then in 2014, Narendra Modi, who had openly criticized, came with him
 vaajapeyi sarkaar ko chhodkar congress ke saath jane kaa unka akalan bhi sateek siddh hua
 The decision to leave the government made him a natural friend of the Congress which came to power in 2004 after defeating the NDA
 itane varshon main unhone railway, sanchaar or ity, khanan, rasayan tathaa urvarak or upabhokta maamle jaise bade mantralayon ko sambhala he
 The veteran Dalit leader has contested Lok Sabha elections from Hajipur 11 times since 1977 and has won this seat nine times
 unki ek jeet to itani prachand thi ki unka naam sabase adhik antar se sansadeey chunaav jeetne ke liye ginis book of world records main shaamil hua
 They lost only twice from Hajipur
 1984 main indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad sahanubhuti lahar main or 2009 main jab lalu prasad ke rajd ke saath unke gathbandhan kaa faisla ulataa sabit hua
 In 2019, when this 73-year-old leader decided to break away from electoral politics, he won from his traditional seat to his younger brother Pashupati Kumar Paras
 ab ve rajyasabha ke jariye sansad main jane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 Though Paswan has been known as a leader holding a limited vote bank and may not have made a dent in any other vote bank, trends have indicated that LJP as a political ally proved beneficial for all
 is
 1999 ke chunaavon main endie ke saath gathbandhan kiya to use rajya kii 54 siton main se 41 siten milin
 Five years later in 2004, he went to the UPA camp and UPA bagged 29 seats
 2014 or 2019 main endie kii jholii bhar gai

 ) He used to rain punches on the opponent and make him breathless
 apni chapaltaa se saamne vaale ko kuch hi der main ghutane techne ko majaboor kar detaa tha
 In his large international tournaments, he enhanced the tricolor and elegance of the tricolor
 lekin aaj wo dar rahaa he
 Not from any opponent, but from ourselves, from their destiny, from their unemployment

 We are talking about India's first professional boxer Dharmendra Singh Yadav
 roji-roti ke liye sangharsh karata desh kaa pehla profeshnal boxrajis desh main ek olympian or kai badi pratiyogitaayen jitkar gaurav ke shandaar lamhe arjeet karne vaala khilaadi ek adad naukari ke liye tarase us desh main khel or khilaadiyon kii bhalaai ke liye bade-bade daawey karnaa sarkaron kii niyat or niyati donon par sawaal khadey karata he
 a billion budget is made for sports every year, but if it is to know how good the game or player is, then there can be no greater example than India's first professional boxer Dharmendra Singh Yadav
 1990 world championships ke semifinal main pahunche the dharmendrabachapan se hi boxing ko lekar junun or virodhiyon par puri chapaltaa se mukke barasaane kii chaturaai ne dharmendra ko apane daur kaa bharat kaa sabase bada mukkebaaz bana diya
 Hard work and dedication to the game soon made it to the top of the successful boxer
 virodhiyon par dharmendra ke panch jab padate the wo bachane ke raste talashne lagate the
 His powerful punch had the effect that he became India's first boxer to reach the semi-finals at the World Youth Boxing Championships in 1990
 brits ranking main chauthe or pan asian rekking main saatven number tak pahuncheek baar safalataa kaa ye silsilaa shuru hua, to har bitate din ke saath lagaataar aage badhata hi gaya
 He won medals for India in unknown tournaments like SAF Games, Asian Championships, Commonwealth Games and gave the country a chance to be proud on the podium
 olympic main bhi bharat kaa pratinidhitiv kiya
 With time, Dharmendra Singh Yadav moved towards professional boxing
 yahaan bhi safalataa kaa aisa silsilaa chalaa ki apane chah ke chah mukaable jite
 Only then did the Brits reach number four in the rankings and number seven in the pan-asian ranking
 boxing main unki badi uplabdhi ko sweekaar karte hue dharmendra singh yadav ko arjuna puraskaar se bhi sammanit kiya gaya
 But it is said that not only the awards increase the pride but do not fill the stomach
 dharmendra ke saath bhi yahi hua
 He has received all the awards and honors, but is seen struggling for a unique job for the well being of himself and family
 naukari ke liye lagaai guhayirjun awardi dharmendra ke saamne patni or do bacchon vaale parivaar ko chalaane kii mushkil chunauti khadi he
 In this period of unemployment, he is tired of going around all the sports institutes and officials, who once associated with him the success of winning his medal
 lekin aaj jab dharmendra unke daravaaje tak ek adad niyamit naukari kii guhaar lekar pahunchate hai to niyamon kaa hawala dekar unki baat ko ansuna kar diya jaataa he
 Such rude looks as if Dharmendra Singh Yadav is not the proud man of boxing in the country, no road imprint seems to be a human hodder, not to become a criminal; Sometimes in the compulsion of bread, people are also forced to think of taking steps towards crime
 dharmendra kehete hai ki unhen aksar is baat kaa dar sataata he ki kahin unki yah laachaari, unhen puri tarah se todakar aparaadh kii taraf na mode de
 Who will listen to Dharmendra's complaint? After all, who will listen to the help of this helpless player
 sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas kaa daawa karne vaali vartmaan sarkaar kii najar kya kisi khilaadi kii is kadar tak kii bebasii kii taraf jaaegi ? kya dharmendra or un jaise anya laachaar khilaadiyon kii taraf khel mantralay kii nigahen rahamat hogi ? agar dharmendra singh yadav jaise bade mukkebaaz ko ek adad naukari nahin milegi to bhala aane vaali peedi khelon main kadam rakhane kii taraf himmat kaise kar paaegi
 Then how will the dream of making India a superpower of sports be fulfilled
 kaise olympic padakon se bharegi hamaari bhi jholii
 It is necessary for the development of sports and sportspersons to create such an environment in the country when players do not think about their bread arrangements after retirement, but only focus on winning their games and medals
 use is baat kaa bharosa ho ki agar aaj vah desh ke liye padak jeetne kii khatir khun-pasinaa ek kar rahaa he to kal ritair hone ke baad uske bare main desh sochega
 He will not have to struggle for bread
 tabhi padakon kii sankhya na sirf badhegi, balki desh main khel samskruti kaa bhi vikaas hoga
 Players like Vikas Krishna Yadav were given the honor of the country
 unhen sahej kar rakhane kii jarurat he na ki roti ke liye sangharsh kii raah par chhod dene kii
 Even after retirement, they can prove to be of great use for the country
 yakeen na ho to mukkebaaz vikaas krishna se puch lijie, jinhone rio olympic se pehle khel mantralay se dharmendra singh yadav ko kuch dinon kii koching ke liye maanga tha
 Dharmendra gave Vikas so much knowledge in that short period that Vikas reached the quarter-finals of Rio Olympics
 jaahir he ki dharmendra singh yadav jaise anbhavi khilaadiyon kaa istemaal agar bhartiya khel praadhikaran sthai naukari dekar coach ke taur par kare to aanevaale dinon main bhartiya mukkebaaji kii disha or dasha badal sakati he
 So will the Sports Authority of India and the Sports Ministry soon get the attention of Dharmendra and give him a permanent job and use his experience for the betterment of Indian boxing? sanjay dutt kii byopic main ranbir kapur ne jis tarah se unka kirdaar nibhaayaa, uski kaaphi prashansa ho rahi he
 His transformation is also very similar to Ranbir's
 lekin dilachasp baat ye he ki sanju ke role ke liye ranbir nahin, balki koi or actor pehali pasand tha
 The name of this actor is Ranveer Singh
 produsar vidhu vinod chopra ne telegraph se kaha, "jab rajkumaar hiraani ne mujhase sanjay dutt kii byopic ke bare main kaha to maine unase poocha- aisa kya he sanjay dutt kii life main ki film banaai jaae? isse acha he meri life par bana lijie
 i left Kashmir in my youth and struggled after coming to Mumbai
 aap or abhijaat joshi apana dimag kho chuke ho"jab rishi kapur ne sanjay dutt se kaha- mere bete ko bigaadna band karochopda aage kehete hai, "iske baad jab hiraani ne mujhe us sabake bare main bataaya jo sanju ke jivan main gata he to main sunakar dang rah gaya
 At first i thought it was absurd, Sanju is not telling the truth to Raju
 lekin phir haman unki 308 garlfrends or america kii sadakon par bas kaa tikat kharidne ke liye bheekh maangane vaali baat kaa sach jaanane ke liye research kiya
 After this we realized that what he told us is true
 "sanju kii 'maadhuri' ne kaha- 'noti bachche hai ranbir kapur'iske baad vidhu vinod chopra ko laga ki sanju kaa role ranbir kii bajaay ranvir singh behatar nibhaa sakate hai
 Hirani later agreed to name him Ranbir
 unhen laga ki ranbir sanjay ke imotions ko behatar parade par utaar sakate hai
 Please tell
 'sanju' kaa nirdesan rajkumaar hiraani ne kiya he
 The film also stars Sonam Kapoor, Vicky Kaushal, Dia Mirza, Paresh Rawal and Anushka Sharma
 ye film 29 june ko relies hone ja rahi he

 badi baat ko halke-phulke andaaj main bayaan karne vaali is film ko lekar adil kaa kahana he ki is film kaa vishay gambhir he, lekin yah gambhir film nahin he
 Adil, who came to Delhi to promote the film Mukti Bhavan, which is releasing this Friday, told IANS in a special telephone conversation, "the film is a story of a father and son
 is film main pita kii moksh paane kii ichha puri karne ke liye betaa unhen lekar kaashi aata he
 Adil is known for the serious characters he played in 'parched' and 'life of Pi', what the film would also be called a serious drama, Adil said, "this makes the serious issue light-hearted
 Is a film to do
 is film kaa vishay vaaki main gambhir he
 Smiles, laughter, tears, surprises will come in many emotions while watching the film
 ' Adil said, "this film will also convey a message to the audience with complete entertainment
 hamen nahin pataa ki kal kya hoga, lekin ham kal kii chintaa main apane aaj ko bhul jate hai, is film main logon ko apane vartmaan ko hansate hue khulkar jeene kaa sandesh diya gaya hai
 When asked the reason behind the character's election, Adil said, "I liked the character of the film very much
" yah ek madhyamvargeey parivaar kaa shaks he, jo apni roj-marraa ke kaamon main ulajhaa rahata he, ek din achaanak uskaa pita use kahata he ki unka antim samay aa gaya he or vah kaashi janaa chaahate hai, to na chaahate hue bhi vah sab kaam chhodkar unke saath jaataa he
 " adil kehete hai, "mujhe aisa lagata he ki zyaadaatar pariwaron main bete or baap kii bich aksar kam samvaad hota he
 You will see in the film that when these two live in Kashi, there are many things between them
 " adil se jab poocha gaya ki kya vah vyavsaayik filmon ke daur se khush hai, to unhone kaha, "film bananaa ek kala he, jiske liye kadi mehnat kerani padati he
 If you want to make a film on common people, social issues and relevant subjects, then a lot will have to be done for it, but if you want to make a film just to earn money, then you can do anything
 vyavsaayik filmon main yah baat dekhne ko milti he
 " aise samay main, jab desh main logon se deshprem va deshbhakti kaa saboot maanga ja rahaa he, kya aapako lagata he ki desh main aapasi sauhaard or bhaichaare kii bhaavana main kami ai he, unhone kaha, "mujhe bilkul nahin lagata he ki desh main aisa maahaul he, balki yah sab hamen televijan channelon or akhabaaron par hi dekhne ko miltaa he

 There is diversity here, which we should celebrate, rise above parochialism
 " Is there such a special thing in this film that inspired you to do it? On this question he said, "there is a special thing behind doing this film and that is death

 It is not discussed
 ham maan lete hai ki ham hajaaron saal jienge or usee anusaar apana jivan jite jate hai, jabaki mrityu kaa koi bharosa nahin hota he

 " kirdaar ke chunaav ke peeche kaa kaaran puche jane par adil ne bataaya, "mujhe film kaa kirdaar bahut pasand aayaa
 This is a middle-class family man who is busy with his daily activities, one day his father suddenly tells him that his last time has come and he wants to go to Kashi, even if he does not want to do all that

 " Adil says, "it seems to me that in most families there is often less communication between the son and the father
 aap film main dekhenge ki jab ye donon kaashi main rahete hai to inke bich kai tarah kii baaten hoti hai
 "when Adil was asked if he was happy with the era of commercial films, he said," Making a film is an art that requires hard work

 In a case related to the ownership of the controversial Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid site in Ayodhya, the Supreme Court on Monday called the Allahabad High Court's decision to divide the Lucknow Bench of the land into three parts in a very important step, and called it peculiar
 And has issued a stay order on it stating the shocker
 court kii is roak se vivaadit sthal par yathasthiti bani rahegi
 a bench of Justices Aftab Alam and Justice RM Lodha said critically for the verdict, “it is a very surprising and strange decision
 kisi ne bhi zamin ke bantwaare kii maang nahin kii thi
 The Allahabad High Court gave the relief which was not demanded by anyone
 hamen is galati ko abhi sudhaarna hoga
 "the Supreme Court has also directed that no religious activity should be conducted on the 67-acre piece of land acquired by the government adjoining the disputed land
 peeth ne kaha ki jab kisi bhi paksh ne bhoomi ke vibhaajan kaa anurodh nahin kiya tha to aisi vyavastha kaise di ja sakati he
 He stayed the High Court verdict, saying, "the court did what they did

 hoicourt ne 2-1 ke bahumat se die apane faisle main vivaadit jameen ko teen hisson main baantate hue ek hissaa sunni vakf board, ek hissaa nirmohi akhaada, or teesraa hissaa 'ramalala' ko diya tha

 Uttar Pradesh holds great importance in the politics of the country
 yahi kaaran he ki yahaan hone vaale har chunaav par puure desh kii nazar rahati he
 On Friday, elections were held for 10 Rajya Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh
 is dauraan puure din sthiti gambhir bani rahi or der raat tak chale drame ke baad bijepi ne baaji maar lee
 BJP candidates won 9 out of 10 seats
 upi ke is rajyasabha chunaav main bilkul usee tarah uthal-puthal machi jis tarah gujarat ke rajyasabha chunaavon main machi thi
 Even then there was a high-voltage drama till late in the night, BJP had put a lot of effort to defeat Ahmed Patel of Congress, but then BJP lost and on Friday it tasted victory
 kya hua uttar pradesh main
 
 
 In fact, bjp's victory in 8 out of 10 seats of Uttar Pradesh was confirmed, while one seat was also decided to go to the account of Samajwadi Party
 lekin asli ladaai 10veen seat ke liye thi, jisapar bijepi kii ore se anil agarwal to vahiin basapa kii ore se bhimrao ambedkar maidan main the
 During voting, cross voting of many mlas came to light, BJP got the benefit of this
 basapa ke anil singh, sapa ke nitin agarwal ne khule taur par bijepi kaa samarthan kiya
 Objection on ballot paper arose in UP Rajya Sabha election when countingcounting started
 is vajah se chunaav ayog ne counting rukvaa di thi
 It was alleged that Nitin Aggarwal and Anil Singh did not show their votes to the Authorize agent
 isaki shikaayat bispi ne chunaav ayog se kii or isi vajah se counting roki gai he
 The BSP and SP had demanded the cancellation of the vote of both the mlas
 chunaav ayog ke aadesh ke baad hi counting shuru hui
 After the b-bjp's r-parantija came to the fore, the BSP accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of using money power, while the BJP was also attacked
 nateezon ke baad uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne kaha ki is chunaav main bijepi kii shandaar jeet se samaajawaadee party kaa avasarwaadi cheharaa pradesh kii janata ne ek baar phir se dekha
 This is not the first time that the opportunistic face of the Samajwadi Party has appeared before the people of the state
 unhone sapa par tanj kasate hue kaha ki sapa sirf lenaa jaanati he, lekin dena nahin jaanati he
 This was the same picture in Gujarat, but the BJP had lost a similar picture in the Rajya Sabha elections in Gujarat last year
 usamen bhi ek-ek vot kii ladaai thi
 That election was also made a question of prestige by BJP
 lekin ain vakt par ahamed patel baazeegar sabit hue the
 a total of 176 votes were cast in the Rajya Sabha election in Gujarat

 The fight was such that from Gujarat to Delhi the Election Commission was stirring
 congress do vidhayakon ke vot radd karwaane ke chakkar main der raat hi chunaav ayog ke daravaaje par pahunch gai thi
 To weaken this effort of the Congress, the BJP sent a delegation of 6 Union Ministers to the Election Commission
 vitt mantri arun jetali ke netritv main ravishankar prasad, piyush goyal, mukhtaar abbaas nakvi, nirmala sitaraman or dharmendra pradhan ne chunaav ayog ke daftar pahunchakar congress kii apil ko darkinar karne kii maang kii thi
 And this happened not once or twice but three times

 At 30 pm, the Election Commission ordered the resumption of counting

 The number of people living below the poverty line is large and this is the biggest failure of the BJP government which they have named the people of India
 It's the biggest achievement of Dr Manmohan Singh that 14 Cr people were listed out of poverty
 BJP govt pushed people into poverty
 Number of people below poverty line went up
 It's the greatest disservice BJP govt did to people of India: p Chidambaram at # congressplenarysessionpic

 There is a class difference between owners and editors' privileges, prejudices and second-rate newsroom supplements, gossip

 We will continue to believe that the future is wireless and we will continue to expand its experience
 Apple has not said anything clearly why the project has been canceled

 dilli ke karolbaag sthit hotel arpit pales main pichley mangalvaar (12 farvari) ko hue bheeshan agnikand ko lekar dilli hai court ne teenon emsidi or dilli sarkaar ko notice bheja he
 During the hearing of this case, the High Court said that the government and civic agencies should explain what is the reason for such an accident and how many such hotels are running in Delhi without NOC so far
 iske alaava court ne muaavje ko lekar bhi agency or dilli sarkaar se jawaab maanga he
 In the High Court on Tuesday, an application was made on behalf of Bhargava, saying that such hotels without fire license are running in Delhi indiscriminately and due to this the lives of the people living here are at stake
 iske alaava bhargav kaa yah bhi kahana tha ki dilli sarkaar ko ek samaysima main aise hotalon, baraat ghar or community centres ke liye guideline tay kar lenaa chahie or agar un guidelins kaa paalan nahin ho rahaa ho to naa sirf aise hotalon ke khilaaf balki un adhikariyon ke khilaaf bhi sakht karrwai honi chahie jin par hotalon kii nigaraanee kaa jimmaa hota he
 Last week, 17 people lost their lives due to the fire at the Arpit Hotel
 hotel main enosi liye bagaiyr ek restaurant bhi chal rahaa tha or bhi kai niyamon kaa paalan kiye bina is hotel ko chalaaya ja rahaa tha
 The owner of Hotel Arpit Palace and his brother Rakesh Goyal were arrested from Delhi Airport on Saturday when they returned from Qatar
 arpit hotel kii tarah hi dilli main saikadon kii taadaad main aise hotel hai jahaan par niyamon ko taak par rakhkar chalaaya ja rahaa he or arpit hotel kii tarah hi yahaan bhi kisi bhi vakt koi durghatana ho sakati he or logon ko apni jaan ganvaani pad sakati he, lekin kai baar sarkaar or agenciyon ke deele ravaiya ke chalate is tarah ke hotel tab tak band nahin hote jab tak ki koi badi durghatana naa ho
 The Delhi High Court was hearing a public interest litigation in Delhi's Baraat Ghar and Community Centers for violation of the rules, but on Tuesday the court has also included private hotels in the petition
 13 march ko is maamle main dilli hai court dobaaraa sunwaayee karegaa
 But before that the Delhi government and civic agencies have to give an affidavit and tell the High Court how their plan is to prevent accidents

 By virtue of this fast, the person gets freedom from sin
 yah ekadshi kashton kaa nivaaran karne vaali or manonukool fal dene vaali hone ke kaaran falda or kaamana purna karne vaali hone se kaamada kahi jaati he
 The story of this Ekadashi was narrated by Shri Krishna to Pandu's son Dharmaraja Yudhishthira
 isse purv raja dilip ko vashishtha muni ne sunai thi
 The prevailing legend of Chaitra Shukla Ekadashi, Dharmararaj Yudhishthira started saying, "O God! i greet you very much
 ab aap krupa karke caitra shukla ekadshi kaa mahatmaya kahie
 Shri Krishna started saying that, o Dharmaraja! At one time, King Dilip asked Guru Vashistha and i tell you the solution that he did
 prachinkaal main bhogipur naamak ek nagar tha
 a king named Pundarik, with many opulence, ruled there
 bhogipur nagar main anek apsara, kinnar tathaa gandharva vaas karte the
 At one place, two men and women, Lalita and Lalit, lived in a very luxurious house
 un donon main atyant sneh tha, yahaan tak ki alag-alag ho jane par donon vyakul ho jate the
 At one time, Lalit was also singing along with other Gandharvas in the meeting of Pundarik
 gaate-gaate usko apni priy lalita kaa dhyaan aa gaya or uskaa swar bhang hone ke kaaran gane kaa swaroop bighad gaya
 Knowing Lalit's mind, a serpent named Karkot told the king the reason for his dissolution
 tab pundaree ne krodhpurvak kaha ki tu mere saamne gaata hua apni stri kaa samaran kar rahaa he
 Therefore, you become a monster eating raw meat and humans, and enjoy the fruits of your actions
 pundaree ke shraap se lalit usee kshan mahakay vishaal rakshas ho gaya
 His face was very fierce, the eyes illuminated like the sun and moon and fire started coming out of his mouth
 uski naak parvat kii kandara ke samaan vishaal ho gai or gardan parvat ke samaan lagane lagi
 The hair of the head looked like trees standing on the mountains and the arms became very long
 kul milakar uskaa sharir aath yojan ke vistaar main ho gaya
 In this way, he became a demon and suffered many kinds of sorrows
 jab uskipriytama lalita ko yah vrittant maaloom hua to use atyant khed huaor vah apane pati ke uddhaar kaa ytn sochane lagi
 The demon lived in dense forests, suffering many kinds of grief
 uski stri uske peeche-peeche jaati or vilaap karti rahati
 Once Lalita wandered behind her husband and reached the Vindhyachal mountain, where Shringi was the ashram of the sage
 lalita sheeghra hi shringi rishi ke ashram main gai or vahaan jaakar vineet bhav se prarthana karne lagi
 Seeing him, Shringi Rishi said that he will subside! Who are you and what have you come here for? Lalitha said that i am My name is Lalitha
 meraa pati raja pundaree ke shraap se vishalkay rakshas ho gaya he
 i feel very sad about it
 uske uddhaar kaa koi upaay batalie
 Shringi Rishi said, o Gandharva Kanya! Now Chaitra Shukla Ekadashi is coming, which is called Kamada Ekadashi
 iskaa vrath karne se manushya ke sab kaary siddh hote hai
 If you do the fast of Kamada Ekadashi and give the fruits of its virtue to your husband, then he will soon be freed from the demon's vagina and the curse of the king will also be calmed down
 muni ke aise vachan sunakar lalita ne caitra shukla ekadshi aane par uskaa vrath kiya or dwadashi ko brahmanon ke saamne apane vrath kaa fal apane pati ko detii hui bhagwaan se is prakaar prarthana karne lagi- he prabho! maine jo yah vrath kiya he iskaa fal mere patidev ko praapt ho jaae jisase vah rakshas yoni se mukt ho jaae
 As soon as she was given the fruits of Ekadashi, her husband got rid of the demon's vagina and regained his old form
 phir anek sundar vastrabhupanon se yukt hokar lalita ke saath vihaar karne laga
 After that both of them boarded the plane and went to Swargalok
 vashishtha muni kehane lage ki he rajan! is vrath ko vidhipurvak karne se samast paap naash ho jate hai tathaa rakshas aadi kii yoni bhi chhot jaati he
 There is no other fast in the world equal to this
 isaki katha padhane yaa sunne se vaajapeya yajna kaa fal praapt hota he

 Finally, when he reached outside Indira's room, the concierge of Indira's room used to ask Nathu how his brother is having mood today, so Nathu often said that everything is fine
 lekin kabhi-kabhaar wo kahata tha ki aaj bibiji gusse main hai
 That thing used to spread throughout the house and everyone would get ready for the whole day accordingly

 15 of the 16 judges of the International Court of Justice were in favor of India, Kulbhushan Jadhav's death sentence has been stayed
 - antarrashtriyacourt ne pakistan ko vienna kanvension kii yaad dilaate hue kaha, paak dwaara vienna samjhaute kaa ulanghan kiya gaya, joki gambhir he
 - The court asked Pakistan why Jadhav was not given a consular, why India was not informed after arresting an Indian citizen
 - bharat ne court se kulbhushan jadhav ko reeha karne kii maang kii thi, court ne bharat kii is maang ko khaarij kar diya he
 - The top judge of ICJ said that there is no scope for doubt about Jadhav being an Indian citizen
 - isije ke sheersh nyaayadhish ne jadhav maamle main bharat ke aavedan kii sweekaaryata par pakistan kii aapattiyon ko khaarij kiya, kaha- bharat kaa aavedan sweekaar karne yogya he
 - Former External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj expressed happiness over the decision of the International Court, on her Twitter account, the former Foreign Minister wrote that the decision of the International Court on the issue of Kulbhushan Jadhav is wholeheartedly welcomed
 yah bharat ke liye badi jeet he
 i wholeheartedly welcome the verdict of International Court of Justice in the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav
 It is a great victory for India
 / 1- The important thing in this decision is that present in the panel of judges, the Chinese judge also gave his decision in favor of India
 bataa den ki pakistan kii ek sainya adaalat dwaara jadhav kii maut kii sajaa sunaae jane ke maamle main bharat ne isije ko chunauti di thi
 Pakistan military court had in April 2017 sentenced retired Indian Navy officer Jadhav (49) to death on espionage and terrorism charges after a closed-door hearing
 unki sajaa par bharat ne kadi pratikriya di thi
 After repeated appeals to release Jadhav from Pakistan, India approached the International Court of Justice in The Hague on 8 May 2017 alleging an open violation of the Vienna Agreement on consular relations in this regard
 jadhav ko jasoos kehane ke pakistan ke aarope ko bebuniyad bataate hue bharat ne vaishvik adaalat main kaha ki jadhav kii giraftaar ke bahut samay baad tak isaki soochna nahin di gai or pakistan ne aaropee ko bhi uske adhikaar nahin bataae
 India later told the ICJ that Pakistan did not allow Jadhav to provide diplomatic contact despite repeated requests from India in violation of the Vienna Agreement
 america main saat muslim bahul deshon ke nagarikon or sharnaarthiyon ke aane par pratibandh vaale donald trump ke aadesh par sangheey apil court ne bhi jhatka diya he
 Because of this, Trump said that judges should be seen in the court
 trump prashasan kii ore se apil court main yachika daakhil kar trevell bain ke faisle par nichali adaalat kii lagaai roak ko jald hataane kii maang kii thi
 His petition was heard by a panel of three judges and all three unanimously declared the order of Seddon Trump Trump
 'court of apills ne apane faisle main kaha, 'hamaara maananaa he ki sarkaar ne yah sabit nahin kiya ki isaki apil main dam he or na hi yah sabit kiya he ki roak nahin hataane se bada nuksaan hoga
 Furious with the decision of the judges, Trump tweeted and said he should look into the court
 trump ke twit kiya, 'aapako adaalat main dekhuunga
 The safety of our country is at stake! 'SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE! - Donald J
 Trump (@realdonaldtrump)february 9, 2017trump ke is twit se saaf he ki vah is maamle main peeche hatane ko taiyaar nahin or ab aadesh bahaali ke liye supreme court kaa rukh kar sakate hai
 However, the US President is unlikely to get good news even from the Supreme Court
 isaki vajah yah he ki supreme court kii aath jajon kii bench main chaar republican rujhaan vaale hai, jabik chaar kaa rujhaan democrates kii taraf he
 In this case, if the decision remains equal to four, then the order of travel ban will remain rejected
 adaalaton se mil rahi niraashaa ke bich kanoonee jaanakaron ke mutabik, trump ko iske liye sansad kaa hi rukh karnaa chahie
 They should bring the bill with the approval of the US Congress, after which it cannot be challenged constitutionally

 The ban was banned by a federal judge, James Robat, on Friday
 jaj ne kaha tha ki is faisle kii vistrut kanoonee samiksha kii jaaegi

 kumbh meley main haridwar kii sanstha divya prem seva mishan dwaara yojit seminar main bhaiya ji joshi ne sirf mandir hi nahin balki vikaas ke mudde par bhi modi sarkaar par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 He said that development will gain momentum when Ram temple is constructed in Ayodhya
 unhone aage kaha ki bharat usee tarah teji se aage badhegaa jis tarah 1952 main somnath mandir ke nirmaan ke baad hua tha or jawahar laal nehru piem the
 Significantly, some Sangh leaders have been of the view that if the BJP has a government at the Center, it should have taken the initiative to build the temple
 kyonki logon ne modi sarkaar ko isliye bhi chunaa tha ki unka maananaa tha ki sarkaar hinduon kii bhaawanaaon kaa dhyaan rakhegi
 But the government's priorities changed after coming to power
 bataa den ki piem modi ne apane haalia intervyuu main kaha tha ki court ke faisle ke baad hi sarkaar mandir nirmaan ke bare main koi faisla legi
 Explaining the statement of Sanghbhaiyaji Joshi, what the RSS said in the cleanliness, the RSS said that the national and cultural awakening being done by cultural festivals like Kumbh Mela motivates the society to be active to take the country towards development
 1951-1952 main somnath mandir kii praan pratishtha ke shubh avasar par tatkaaleen mahamahim raashtrapati dow rajendra prasad ne apane bhaashan main bhi somnath jaise rashtriya gaurav chinh ke punarnirmaan kii ghatana ko bharat ke samruddhi kii ore agrasar hone vaali ghatana kaha tha
 After 6 years, Kumbh will be completed again in 2025, by then the construction process of Ram temple, symbol of India's national pride, will also be completed and move towards national prosperity, Bhaiyaji Joshi expressed this belief

 ' lashkar or alqaida ke baad aatank kaa nayaa or sabase khaufnak cheharaa he ieses
 First the New York World Trade Center, then the terrorist attack on Mumbai and now Paris
 aatank kaa naam kuch bhi ho lekin har baar insaaniyat hi lahooluhaan hoti he
 a similar terror attack took place in Paris on Friday night which shook the whole world
 yah hamalaa duniya main teesraa bada aatanki hamalaa ban gaya
 The first major terrorist attack, fourteen years before today, on September 11, 2001, the whole world saw the act of terror, which caused humanity to panic
 amarika ke mashhoor shahar neuyark par aatankiyon ne is tarah hamalaa kiya ki har koi hairaan rah gaya
 With the help of the aircraft, a luxurious building of the world i
e
 World Trade Center was set in the moment
 hajaaron log maut ke munh main samaa gaye
 The second major attack, Mumbai, the financial capital of India, still thrives by remembering that day
 wo din tha 26 november, 2008 kaa jab aatankiyon ne kai jagah hamale kiye
 Killed many innocents
 kai logon ko bandhak bhi banaaya gaya
 Which also included foreign tourists
 puraa desh sann rah gaya tha
 After 24 hours of hard work, the security forces killed the terrorists by playing on their lives and caught a terrorist Kasab alive
 jise baad main faansee di gai
 And now, on the night of the Paris attack, the Parisians were engrossed in their tune
 har koi weekend kaa majaa lene shahar kii sadakon par tha
 President Hollande himself was enjoying a football match at a large stadium in the city
 tabhi is khubasuratshahar par aatankiyon ne hamalaa bol diya
 Blasts were carried out at many places simultaneously
 goli baari hui or kai logon ko maut kii neend sula diya gaya
 ISIS wants to rule the whole world, ISIS has taken the responsibility of the world's most dreaded terrorist organization
 is vahashi ban chuke aatanki sanghathan kaa makasad he iraq or syria sahit duniya bhar main islamic state kaa jhanda laharaana
 The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria has been formed for this purpose
 is sanghathan ne apane makasad ko hasil karne ke liye aatank ko apana hathiyaar bana liya he
 ISI, which came to the world in June 2014, was the time when ISIS made its presence known on the world map for the first time
 tab issanghathan ke swayambhu commander abu bakar al bagdadine achaanak hi ek rose iraq ke mosul or tikrit shaharon ke darmyaan khud ko islamic hukumat kaa netaa bataa kar sabakaa dhyaan apni ore khinchne kii koshish kii thi
 But with this, the plan that Baghdadi revealed, it shocked the whole world
 islam ke naam par katleambagadadi ne kaha ki wo jald hi duniya ke tamaam islamic mulkon ke saath-saath puri duniya par apni badshahath kaayam karke rahegaa
 But then the world did not take ISIS as seriously
 uski vajah ye thi ki bagdadi se pehle bhi duniya main naa jane kitne taanashaah paidaa hue or barbaad ho gaye
 But seeing the manner in which ISIS started the slaughtering in the name of Islamic rule, everyone was shocked
 alqaida se alag hokar bana iesaosama bin laden ke al-kaayda se alag ho kar pashchimi iraq or purvi syria ke ek bade ilaake main sunni aatankwaadiyon kaa ye gut dhire-dhire apane pair pasaar rahaa tha
 But soon after taking command of Baghdadi, this group of terrorists started killing and killing all the people coming in their way like carrot-radish
 katl ke nae tareekon se bani pahachaanais aatanki sanghathan ne maut ke nae tareeke apanaae
 Whose death can be blushing apane raste main aane vaale logon ko berahami ke saath maut ke ghat utaarna is sanghathan kaa shagal ban gaya
 This terrorist gang devised new death games ranging from beheading, throwing down tall buildings, burning alive, and shooting them close in the head
 or unka video banaakar jari karnaa aies kaa khaas shauk ban gaya
 Baghdadi's dream is that the Islamic Emirate: Baghdadi's aim is not just to conquer Iraq and Syria, but he wants to create an Islamic Emirate by combining all the Levant countries ie Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine and Turkey
 bagdadi ke bare main ye kaha jaataa he ki wo do baar amariki hawaii hamale main buree tarah zakhmi ho chukaa he
 But the fact is that till now the news of his death has not been revealed
 duniya kaa most wonted he bagdadiiess kaa sargana abu bakar al bagdadi duniya kaa mostwanted apradhi ban chukaa he
 In Iraq, a reward of 60 crores is declared on the head of this terrorist who murdered
 use duniya kaa sabase beraham aatankwaadi kaha jaataa he
 Baghdadi has been a supporter of Al Qaeda commander Osama bin Laden
 or wo uski maut kaa badla lenaa chahta he
 Campaign against ISIS The United States has started a campaign against the bestial forces of Baghdadi along with its fellow countries
 duniya main iesas ke tamaam thikaanon ko khatm karne yojana banaai gai he
 The work is going on is karrwai se iesas ko bada jhatka laga
 This allied action was also against the Assad government of Syria
 syria ke grihayuddh main aies ke khilaaf hamale ke makasad se rus bhi kud padaa
 Which is considered an advocate of the Assad government
 france se liya badlais ke khilaaf in deshon ne tevar or tikhe kar die
 France was actively participating in this campaign
 pichley saal sitambar se hawaii hamalon main juta france ab apane sabase bade yudhpot ko maidan main utaarne kii taiyaari kar chukaa he
 ISIS has been furious with this
 apane thikaanon par hue hamalon se baukhalaakar hi usne france ko dahalane kii sajeesh rachi
 And on Friday night, IS attacked Paris and expressed its dangerous intentions
 bayaan jari kar di dhamkiais ne shanivaar ko ek bayaan jari kiya
 In which he said that the Paris attack was the result of meddling in Syria and insulting Prophet Hazrat Mohammad
 bayaan main dhamkee di gai ki agar france ne apni is niti ko lambey vakt tak jari rakhaa to vah iesas ke nishane par rahegaa

 The language that started after Narendra Modi and Priyanka Gandhi is not taking the name of war

 Ten of the ten terrorists who attacked Mumbai were betrayed by their own masters
 naa sirf dhokhaa diya tha balki unase jhooth bhi bolaa tha
 In fact, these ten terrorists were made Mujahideen by saying that they will be used for the independence of Kashmir
 lekin dedh saal baad jab training puri ho gai to unhen achaanak mumbai bhej diya gaya
 No one else has disclosed this to Ajmal Kasab himself, who claims that every terrorist in Pakistan is prepared in the name of Kashmir
 nariman house main kul do aatankwaadi ghuse the
 And both of them were completely unknown to Mumbai as well as Nariman House
 lekin pakistan main baithe unke aakaa mumbai yaa nariman house se anjaan nahin the
 Aaj Tak has got the details of the terrorists talking to Pakistani bosses, which will blow your senses
 pakistan main baithe aatank ke aakaaon ko nariman house, usamen rahane vaale log or aasapaas ke ilaake kii puri jaankaree thi
 They knew that an Israeli family also lived inside and the terrorists had entered the house of that family directly
 nariman house dakshini mumbai ke rihaishi ilaake ke bich-bich khadi wo building jisamen zyaadaatar log kiraye par rahete hai or inhen kirayedaron main shaamil tha israel ke 5 sadasyeey moshe kaa parivaar
 On the night of 26 November, at about quarter past ten, two terrorists hit the Moshe's house directly in the same Nariman House, firing bullets from the AK-47 and taking the five hostage at gunpoint
 nariman house main ghuse do aatankwaadiyon main se ek ke paas ek mobile phone tha jiskaa number tha-9819464530
 After entering inside, both the terrorists kept throwing grenades out of the house continuously and intermittently till the next morning and sometimes firing bullets
 suraksha agenciyon ko pataa tha ki nariman house main aatankwaadi hai
 But he was forced to fight them face to face
 kyonki andar bandhakon kii jaan ko khatra tha
 Therefore, just like Taj and Oberoi, Mumbai Police took a position outside Nariman House but started waiting for the commandos to take action
 raat gujri or subah hui
 The five hostages were still targets of the terrorists
 delli se enesji ke commando nariman house pahunch chuke the or morcha lene kii taiyaari kar rahe the
 Then on the afternoon of November 27, suddenly, the mobile phone of the terrorists rang for the first time
 kol pakistan se tha
 This was the first call of the terrorists sitting in Pakistan after the attack and the phone was made on the same number whose SIM was purchased from India and then brought back to India after being taken to Pakistan
 is pehali baatcheet main pakistan main baithe aakaaon ne moshe kii maa se sidhe baat kii
 Actually the terrorists sitting in Pakistan wanted to talk about the agreement through Moshe's mother
 wo bandhakon kii jaan ke badale apni kuch sharten manvaanaa chaahate the
 The special thing in this is that four bosses of terrorists were talking to Pakistan
 bhartiya khufia agenciyon ko yakeen he ki unamem se teen to jarraar shah, abu hamaja or abu kafa hi honge
 It is clear from this conversation that Moshe's mother was alive at least till the afternoon of 27 November: Not only this, it is also clear from this conversation that Moshe's family talked to their people for their release and their conversation Terrorists were also taken
 moshe kii maa se baat karne ke baad ab ek baar phir phone par aatankwaadi babar or pakistan main baithe uske aakaaon se baatcheet shuru ho gai or is baar baatcheet kasaab ko lekar ho rahi thi
 The phone conversation was taking place on the afternoon of 27 November and Ajmal Kasab was arrested at Girgaum Chowpatty at around twelve o'clock on the night of 26 November
 pakistan main baithe aatank ke aakaaon ko pataa tha ki kasaab pakadaa gaya he
 That is why he was talking about his release on the phone
 yani wo chaahate the ki bandhakon kii jaan ke evaj main kasaab ko nariman house tak uske saathiyon ke paas pahunchaa diya jaae
 The conversation was still going on
 bas fark ye tha ki nariman house se tamaam baat aatankwaadi babar kar rahaa tha jabaki pakistan se phone par ek ke baad ek uske chaar aaka baari-baari se usase baatcheet kar rahe the
 The terrorists sitting in Pakistan were not only talking on the phone, but they were also constantly watching live pictures of this attack on TV every second
 darasal kuch pakistani news channel bhartiya news channel se live tasviren dikhaa rahe the
 And by seeing these live pictures, the terrorists bosses from Pakistan were constantly telling their colleagues in Nariman House the position of security agencies
 wo ye tak bataa rahe the ki police kya kar rahi he or commando kidar morcha liye hue hai
 Both the terrorists were inside Nariman House and were hidden in such a way that no one could see them from outside
 lihaaja baahar koun kahaan par he or kis taraf se unhen gheraa ja rahaa he isaki koi jaankaree unhen nahin thi
 So they were taking this information from their masters in Pakistan
 darasal jis vakt mumbai main ye oparation chal rahaa tha tab pakistan ke kai tivi channel bhartiya news channel ko live kaat rahe the or tivi par use hi live dekh kar pakistan main baithe aaka nariman house main baithe aatankwaadiyon ko baahar kaa haal bataa rahe the
 It is clear from this conversation that every little bit of information around Nariman House was about the terror figures sitting in Pakistan and they were constantly working on the phone as the eyes of the terrorists sitting in Nariman House
 unhen bataa rahe the ki wo kya karen, kidam fire karen, kidar grenade phenke or kidar posishan len
 That is, the whole strategy was being prepared live sitting thousands of miles away from Mumbai and it was being implemented with the help of phone
 nariman house ko desh ke dushmano ke kabje se chhudaane ke liye enesji ke commando maukey par pahunch chuke the lekin saath hi inaki har ek gatividhi par pakistan main baithe aatankwaadiyon ke aakaaon kii paini najar bani hui thi
 That is why he was being instructed on the phone how to take a front against the commandos

 In Rajasthan, the BJP has once again decided to contest the assembly elections in the name of Vasundhara Raje Scindia
 haalanki pehle mana ja rahaa tha ki bijepi vasundhara raaje kii jagah kisi duusare chehre par daanv khel sakati he lekin amit shah ne ravivaar ko saare kayaason par brake laga diya
 Let me tell you that there have been a total of 17 by-elections in Rajasthan since 2013, in which Vasundhara Raje did not get success even once
 yahi vajah he bijepi ke kai netaaon ne vasundhara raaje ke khilaaf bagawati tevar akhriyaar kar rakhaa tha, jise darkinar kar amit shah ne vasundhara ke naam kaa elaan kiya
 It is a compulsion for BJP to field Vasundhara as CM face for the fourth time in Rajasthan or it can be easily understood by these five things
 1
 The BJP, which bowed in front of Vasundhara's power, has managed to make the party high command aware of its power
 darasal vasundhara kii jagah kisi duusare chehre ko aage badhaane par party kii tut kaa badha khatra tha
 80% of BJP mlas in Rajasthan belong to Vasundhara camp and are blind devotees
 ye sabhi unke ek ishaare par koi bhi kadam uthaane ko raji hai
 In such a situation, the party high command had to stamp his name
 isse pehle piem narendra modi or party adhyaksh amit shah kendriya krishi rajya mantri gajendra singh shekhavat ko pradeshdhyaksh bananaa chaahate the, par vasundhara raaje is par raji nahin thi
 The party's central leadership made all efforts to persuade Raje, but she did not budge
 narendra modi ke pradhanmantri or amit shah ke bijepi adhyaksh banane ke baad sambhavat: yah pehla mauka tha jab in donon netaaon ko party ke kisi kshetreey kshatrap ne na keval sidhi chunauti di, balki ghutane techne pad gaye the
 Madan Lal Saini had to be made the chairman in place of Gajendra Singh
 2
 Vasundhara Raje means BJP and BJP means Vasundhara Raje in Rajasthan
 maujuuda samay main rajya main vasundhara ke kad kaa bijepi main koi doosraa cheharaa nahin he
 Although there are many veteran leaders in the party like Om Mathur, Bhupendra Yadav, but they do not have the support base
 iskaa bhi phayda vasundhara ke paksh main jaataa he
 It can be understood even better that Vasundhara Raje managed to win 78 seats on her own even after the Sangh lifted its hand in the 2008 assembly elections
 3
 The central leadership is worried more about 2019 assembly elections than the Rajasthan assembly elections in 2019
 aise main 2019 se pehle bijepi vasundhara raaje ko naaraaz kar kisi tarah kaa koi jokhim bharaa kadam nahin uthaanaa chaahati he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP managed to win all the seats in Rajasthan
 aise main giri se giri haalat main bijepi apni aadhi se zyada siten bachaane main kaamyaab rah sakati hai, lekin vasundhara ko naaraaz karke sabhi siton ko nahin khona chaahati he
 4
 madhya pradesh conectionavasundhara raaje madhya pradesh ke gwalior ke sindhiya parivaar kii beti hai
 His sister is a minister in the Shivraj government
 rajasthan ke saath hi madhya pradesh main bhi vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 If the BJP puts forward another face instead of Vasundhara, it can have an impact in Madhya Pradesh
 5
 The caste equationswusundhara Raje was married in the Dholpur royal family of the Jat community
 rajasthan main jat samudaay 12 fisadi he, jo vasundhara ke peeche ekamusth khadaa he
 The Jat community is also politically the strongest community in the state
 iske alaava obisi maton ko saadhane kii bhi koshish kii he
 In view of OBC votes, the command of the party was administered to Madan Lal Saini
 alag-alag samaaj ke jaateey sammelan kar unhen saadhane kii koshish main juty hai
 Vasundhara's performance in Rajasthan? There are 200 assembly seats in Rajasthan, BJP had relied on Vasundhara Raje's face in the 2003, 2008 and 2013 assembly elections
 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko do tihaai se zyada bahumat mila tha
 163 seats were won under Vasundhara's leadership while the Congress was reduced to just 21 seats
 2008 main vasundhara ke netritv main hi bijepi utari thi
 In 2008, the Congress had got 96 seats, while the BJP had got only 78 seats
 lekin 2003 main vasundhara ke netritv main bijepi ko 120 seat mili thi jabaki congress ko sirf 56 seat hi mili thi

 During the hearing, Lobsang Wangyal and Phungsuk Wangyal stated in the High Court that they are registered voters in India, yet the application for their Indian passport was rejected on the grounds that even though he was born in India in 1970 Has happened, but he is of Tibetan descent
 kanoonee rup se bhartiya naagarik manenvangyal ne court se guhaar lagaayi thi ki kshetreey passport adhikari (aarpeo) ko nirdesh diya jaae ki tibeti logon ko, jo bharat main 26 janvari 1950 ke baad or 1 july 1987 se pehle paidaa hue hai
 They are legally Indian citizens
 is yachikakarta ke paas kahin kii bhi naagarikta nahin he
 It was stated in the petition that the petitioner has a yellow book and identity certificate on the basis of which he can travel
 jaane kya he kanoon1955 main paas bharat ke naagarik kanoon ke tahat 26 janvari 1950 ke baad paidaa har vyakti bhartiya naagarik he
 After this, the law was amended to say that a person born after July 1, 1987, cannot claim Indian citizenship on the basis of birth
 yadi uske mata-pita main se ek bhartiya he tabhi use bhartiya naagarikta mil sakati he
 Permit to stay in the country
 However, the government has allowed all Tibetans who have been born in India and registered themselves as foreigners till the age of 16 irrespective of the date of birth
 yah panjikaran asthaayee he lekin unhen desh main rahane ke liye permit detaa he
 At the same time, for traveling abroad, an identity certificate is issued instead of a passport
