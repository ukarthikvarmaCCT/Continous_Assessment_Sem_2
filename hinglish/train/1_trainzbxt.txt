or yah kitna or badhegaa yah iran sankat par nirbhar karata he
 The second big problem is to stop the rupee rolling in front of the government
 rupaya he ki maanata hi nahin, lagata he usamen or petrol main hode lagi hui he ki koun pehle 100 kaa aankada choota he
 Although the common people have nothing to do with the falling rupee value, but those who import and export and if they do their transactions in dollars, they must be getting hurt
 yahi nahin haal ke dinon main share bazaar kii haalat bhi thik nahin lag rahi he
 The stock market is witnessing such ups and downs that there will always be danger for small investors
 
 a major concern is the condition of farming
 
 Rate of growth in farming in 2017-18 2
 1 fisadi aanki gai he
 
 jo ki pichley saal 4
 Was 9 percent
 
 Sharad Pawar was the agriculture minister for ten years in the UPA, when the sector was doing well, but many people will not know who is the agriculture minister right now
 haa yadi aap bihar se aate hai yaa patrkaar hai to aapako maaloom ho saktaa he
 
 aise halaat main pradhanmantri kaa behatar emspi dene kaa vaayada or kisaanon kii aamadani ko doguna karne kii manshaa par pani phir saktaa he
 
 yahi nahin notebandi ko lekar rirjav bank ne jo kaha usase bhi sarkaar ke is kadam par sawalia nishaan laga hua he
 The government is looking strongly on Rafale, but the government needs to do a lot on issues related to the people
 tippaniyan The first test of the government is the assembly elections to be held in states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Telangana, in these states also the BJP is going to contest on the face of Prime Minister Modi
 yahi vajah he ki jaise-jaise chunaav najadik aate jaaenge aapako pakistan kii baaten adhik sunai dengi or isaki shuruyaat to abhi se hi ho gai he
 BJP will try to prove Congress and Rahul Gandhi friendly to Pakistan
 jisase ki kashmir main girte haalat se logon kaa dhyaan hataa rahe
 Now it will depend on the opposition how they continue to raise the issues of the people and keep pressure on the government in unison

 Not only this, the condition of the stock market is not looking good in recent times
 share bazaar itnaa utaar chadhaav dekh rahaa he ki chote niveshkon ke liye khatra hameshaa bana rahegaa
 
 ek badi chintaa kii vajah he kheti kii haalat
 
 2017-18 main kheti main vruddhi kii dar 2
 1 percent is estimated
 
 Which last year 4
 9 fisadi thi
 
 upie main sharad pavaar das saal tak krishi mantri the tab ye sector acha kar rahaa tha magar abhi krishi mantri koun he bahuton ko maaloom nahin hoga
 Yes, you may know if you come from Bihar or are a journalist
 
 In such a situation, the Prime Minister's promise of giving better MSP and the intention of doubling the income of the farmers can turn water again
 
 Not only this, what has been said by the Reserve Bank about demonetisation, there is a question mark on the government's move
 rafel par sarkaar majbootee se dati hui dikh rahi he magar logon se jude muddon par sarkaar ko kaaphi kuch karne kii jarurat he
 The comments sarkaar kii pehali pariksha madhyapradesh,rajasthan,chhattisgarh aukar telugana jaise rajyon main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav he in rajyon main bhi bijepi pradhanmantri modi ke chehre par hi chunaav ladane vaali he
 This is the reason that as elections get closer, you will hear more about Pakistan and it has already started
 bijepi kii koshish hogi ki congress or rahul gandhi ko pakistan kaa hitaishi sabit karnaa
 So that the falling condition in Kashmir keeps the attention of the people
 ab yah vipaksh par nirbhar karegaa ki vah kis tarah se janata ke muddon ko uthaate rahen or ekajute hokar sarkaar par dabaab banaae rakhen

 maharashtra or haryana vidhansabha ke chunaav desh main aarthik susti ke maahaul ke bich hone ja rahe hai
 For both the states which contribute around 19 per cent to the country's GDP, the importance of industries is more because if the factories are closed then the local people have to bear the brunt of it
 aarthik susti ko congress purajor tareeke se oochaal rahi he or mudda bananaa chaahati he
 Despite this, analysts are still considering the bjp's upper hand as heavy

 According to IBEF, Maharashtra accounted for 14 of the country's GDP during 2017-18

 There are 16 airports and two large and 48 small ports

 Maharashtra has a large social and industrial infrastructure working primarily in the IT, electronics, manufacturing industry
 congress ke varisht netaa or purv saansad sanjay nirupam kaa kahana he ki ham koshish kar rahe hai ki ye janata ke bich aarthik mandi ko logon ke saamne laayaa jaae
 The government had promised that two crore people would be given jobs, but instead of giving jobs, jobs are being snuffed out

 But the people of Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena are deliberately trying to take the entire debate on 370 issues

 The BJP is seeking votes on its five years of work and looks stronger than the Congress on the ground of nationalism
 raajnneetik vishleshak abhaya kumaar dube kehete hai, ye mandi or aarthik susti chunavi mudda nahin ban paaenge
 The BJP will easily win the elections of Maharashtra and Haryana as there are social equations in them and they are in favor of the BJP

 However, there is still more than three weeks to go to the polls and the election results will show whether the economic recession environment can leave any electoral impact in these states
 *** Uttar Pradesh has two phases of voting and five phases of voting are yet to be done
 in charnon ke liye partiyon ko kaddavar netaa reliyon ko sambodhit kar rahe hai or zyada se zyada matadaataaon ko prabhavit karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 Minor activists are engaged in public relations programs with local leaders and are explaining party policies to the voters
 jahaan is chunaav main sattadhari dal samaajawaadee party or congress kaa gathbandhan jeet ke daawey kar rahaa he, vahiin bijepi ko is baar modi lahar dikhaai de rahi he or vah bhi satta main vaapasi kii ummid liye baithe hai
 In this election, the third biggest force is seen by the Bahujan Samaj Party, whose chief Mayawati is asking the voters to vote for the party through daily rallies
 is puure chunavi maahaul ke bich sabase aashcharya karne vaali baat yah dikhaai de rahi he ki congress party kii ore se rahul gandhi hi sabase zyada reliyon ko sambodhit kar rahe hai
 Even after the alliance with the Samajwadi Party, no Congress leader was called by the SP to seek votes for the SP leaders
 sutron kaa kahana he ki star prachaarkon main congress party ne bhale hi kai partiyon kii suchi chunaav ayog ko di ho, lekin sahyogi dal samaajawaadee party ke pratyaashiyon kii ore se keval rahul gandhi, sonia gandhi or priyanka gandhi ko chunaav prachaar ke liye maanga gaya he
 Sources in the Congress Party say that there is no definite decision regarding the campaigning of Priyanka Vadra (gandhi) and Sonia Gandhi
 vahiin congress main duusari qatari ke netaaon ke chunaav prachaar ko lekar samaajawaadee party utsahit nahin he
 It is believed that the Samajwadi Party leaders are also distancing themselves from the leaders of the Congress Party because many scams took place during the UPA tenure at the Center under the leadership of the Congress Party
 is samay samaajawaadee party congress ke daagi netaaon se dur rahanaa chaahati he
 It is believed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is targeting the scandals during the UPA government from Parliament to the election meetings and even former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is also targeted
 isliye congress ke ghotaalon kaa khamiyaja samaajawaadee party ke netaa nahin bhugatna chaahate hai
 So far it has been seen that after Rahul Gandhi, Raj Babbar is more active in campaigning from Congress
 tippaniyan So far it has also been seen that Samajwadi Party leaders are seeking votes for Congress candidates but only Congress leaders are seeking votes for Congress candidates and SP leaders have not felt their need
 congress kii ore se farrukhabad main salmaan khurshid or kanpur main shriprakash jaiswal apane ummidavaaron ke liye prachaar kar rahe hai
 At the same time, the most surprising thing is that Ghulam Nabi Azad, the Congress in-charge of Uttar Pradesh, is also not campaigning for SP candidates
 yah alag baat he ki samaajawaadee party kii ore priyanka gandhi ko chunaav prachaar ke liye aagrah kiya gaya tha lekin priyanka gandhi abhi tak apane tay kaaryakramon ke hisaab se vot kii apil karne ke liye rajya main nahin gai he
 Samajwadi Party leaders are said to be angry about this confusion
 bataa den ki congress main duusari qatari ke netaaon pi chidambaram, kapil sibbal, ahamed patel, jairam ramesh, anand sharma, shakeel ahamed, shila dikshit, sachin payalat, jyotiraditya sindhiya, digvijay singh, manish tiwari jaise netaaon ke prachaar ko lekar sapa kii taraf se koi maang nahin he
 Amidst this entire electoral atmosphere, the most surprising thing is that Rahul Gandhi is addressing the most number of rallies on behalf of the Congress party
 samaajawaadee party se gathbandhan ke baad bhi sapa netaaon ke liye vot maangane ke liye sapa kii ore se kisi congress netaa ko bulaayaa nahin gaya
 Sources say that even though the Congress Party has listed many parties among the star campaigners to the Election Commission, only Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi have been sought for election campaigning from the ally Samajwadi Party candidates
 
 congress party ke sutron kaa kahana he ki priyanka wadra (gandhi) or sonia gandhi ke chunaav prachaar ko lekar abhi kuch tay nahin he
 At the same time, Samajwadi Party is not excited about the election campaign of the second line leaders in the Congress
 mana ja rahaa he ki samaajawaadee party ke netaa isliye bhi congress party ke netaaon se duuri banaae hue hai kyonki congress party ke netritv main centre main upie kaarykaal main kai ghotaale hue the
 At this time Samajwadi Party wants to stay away from tainted leaders of Congress
 mana ja rahaa he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi sansad se lekar chunavi sabhaaon main upie sarkaar ke samay hue ghotaalon ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai or yahaan tak kii purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh bhi nishane par hai
 Therefore, the leaders of the Samajwadi Party do not want to bear the brunt of the Congress scams
 abhi tak yah dekha gaya he ki rahul gandhi ke baad congress kii ore se rajbabbar hi chunaav prachaar main zyada sakriy hai
 The comments abhi tak yah bhi dekha gaya he ki samaajawaadee party ke netaa to congress ummidavaaron ke liye vot maang rahe hai lekin congress ke ummidavaaron ke liye sirf congress netaa hi vot maang rahe hai or sapa netaaon ne unki jarurat mahasoos nahin kii he
 On behalf of the Congress, Salman Khurshid in Farrukhabad and Sriprakash Jaiswal in Kanpur are campaigning for their candidates
 vahiin, sabase aashcharya kii baat to yah he ki uttar pradesh main congress ke prabharee gulam nabi aaazaad bhi sapa ummidavaaron ke liye prachaar nahin kar rahe hai
 It is a different matter that Priyanka Gandhi was requested to campaign for the Samajwadi Party but Priyanka Gandhi has not yet gone to the state to appeal for the vote according to her schedule

 saal 2014 main hue loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko uttar pradesh kii 80 main se 38 siton par paanch fisadi yaa usase kam vot mili the
 In the other 14 seats, it got 10 percent or less votes
 inhen aankadon kii badaulat yah maan liya gaya tha ki is baar rajya main congress ko baahar rakhane se sapa-basapa-ralod ke gathbandhan par koi khaas asar nahin padegaa
 But with Priyanka Gandhi's foray into politics, the Congress is no longer just another party like it was five years ago
 chunaav ke lihaaj se desh ke is sabase ahm rajya main muqabla vaaki trikoniya ho gaya he
 Will the Gaddinshin BJP benefit from the split of opposition votes as a result of this triangular contest? In 2014, a total of 42 in the bag of the three grand alliance partners in Uttar Pradesh
 7 fisadi vot aae the, jabaki bhaajapa ne 42
 It won 71 seats with a vote share of 3 per cent
 itane kareebi mukaable main congress ko mili vot nirnaayak sabit ho sakate hai
 Scrutinizing the list of Congress candidates shows that while the party can dent the prospects of a grand alliance in some seats, it will only help the alliance in other seats
 masalan, saharanpur main donon pakshon ke bich kadaa muqabla dikhaai detaa he
 Leaders of the three parties of the grand alliance — Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) Supremo Mayawati, Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief Ajit Singh and his son Jayant Chaudhary — held a massive rally in Deoband on 7 April
 isi nirvachan kshetra main do din baad priyanka ke road sho main bhi baari bheed umadi
 Both the Congress and the Grand Alliance rely to a large extent on Muslim votes
 saharanpur main 2014 main congress ko 34 fisadi vot mili the or vah bhaajapa ko mili 40 fisadi voton ke baad duusare number par thi
 It is one of the nine minority-dominated seats in UP where the party has directly challenged the Grand Alliance by fielding strong Muslim candidates
 baaki aath siten hai—bijanour, sitapur, sant kabir nagar, devaria, farrukhabad, badaayun, muradabad or khiri
 The Congress hopes that it will overtake the alliance by bringing Muslim votes in these seats and upper caste votes considered angry with the BJP
 congress kii ranneeti uttar pradesh main savarna jatiyon ke irdagird buni gai he
 According to a study, the upper castes account for 19 percent in the state, but 44 percent of the mlas come from these castes
 savarna jatiyon main bhi brahman bhaajapa se khaastaur par naaraaz bataae jate hai or unki naaraazgi kii vajah he rajya prashasan main thakuron kaa badhata varchasv
 To woo Hindu votes, the Congress has often emphasized the Hindu and Brahmin identity of party president Rahul Gandhi and sister Priyanka Gandhi
 muslim voton main foot kaa phayda congress ko tabhi milegaa jab vah hinduon kaa samarthan hasil kar paaegi
 a study by the Center for the Study of Developing Societies shows that when the Congress won 21 seats in UP in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the party received 25 percent Muslim and 31 percent Brahmin votes
 is baar muslim voton ke bantane kii sambhaavna ne mahagathbandhan ko chintaa main daal diya he to yah samaj main aata he
 For this reason, Mayawati's appeal to Muslims to vote for a one-time coalition candidate in Saharanpur is not surprising
 sapa congress ke takaraavvaadi ravaiye ko lekar palatwaar se bachati rahi he
 The BSP has fielded strong candidates in many of the 15 constituencies, except Amethi and Rae Bareli, where the Congress is looking to win
 inamen se ek dhaurhara he jahaan muslim aabaadi 20 fisadi se zyada he
 The BSP may not have done so, but the SP has avoided putting up strong candidates in many seats like Kanpur, Unnao and Kushinagar and has given the Congress a better chance of winning against the common enemy BJP
 badale main congress ne bhi azamgarh, kannauj, mainpuri, bagpat or mujffarnagar kii sapa or ralod kii majboot siton par yaa to kamjor ummidavaar khadey kiye hai yaa phir maidan khaali chhod diya he
 Apart from this, the Congress has fielded weak candidates in around 50 seats due to the poor condition of the organization, which should help the Grand Alliance against the BJP
 alabatta, congress ke ummidavaaron main sapa or basapa ke dalbadalu bhi hai jo akhilesh or mayawati ko beshak raas nahin aayaa hoga
 In fact, Priyanka's strategy to awaken the dormant Congress workers in UP has also included those who leave other parties
 bhaajapa kii savitri bai phule or ashok kumaar dohare, basapa kii kaisar jahaan or nasimuddin siddiki or sapa ke rakesh sachaan congress ke paale main aane vaale aise hi kuch bade netaa hai
 As the Congress weakens around 50 seats, there will be a direct fight between the BJP and the Grand Alliance, the Congress hopes that it will overtake the alliance by bringing Muslim votes in Muslim dominated seats and upper caste votes considered angry with the BJP

 In a statement issued on Friday, media coordinator and former Legislative Council member of Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee said that the speed with which the state government is uncovering and investigating the scams of the previous regime is commendable but would have been good The state government would have acted on the investigation which has been completed by the state's Lokayukta
 unhone kaha ki sapa sarkaar ke gathan ke do maah biit jane ke baad bhi lokayukta dwaara puri kii ja chuki jaanch par abhi tak koi karrwai nahin kii gai he

 Europe has emerged as the center of the most serious global concerns, amidst the resumption of the US, the strengthening of China, the middle position of most of the other emerging markets, about which India has no news (let us assume that the Ministry of External Affairs It must have been first reported)
 patanonmukh arthvyavasthaaen, vardidhari balon (ukraine) ke bich puraane kism ke sangharsh, vaishvik or gharelu poshit islamic aatank (france or belgium), rus ko shaitani raashtra ke rup main dekha janaa or uske dakshini kinaaron par (syria, iraq or turki) tathaa africa ke kuch hisson main uttari tatavarti ilaakon main iageies naam ke daanav kaa ubhaar—yah vaishvik satta santulan main aayaa aisa badlaav he jise tasveeron, paath, nakshe or sanrachana main baraabar dekha ja saktaa he
 One important result of this is that the basic idea of globalization that WEF represents has been challenged

 The newly popular Prime Minister of Italy (matteo Renji, who turned one year old and 40 years old earlier this month) needs Germany's help due to a fatal fiscal deficit but he is not willing to do so in his arrogance

 During this time, Ukraine's President Poroshenko is constantly urging that he needs European security because Putin only understands the language of power

 On the other hand, some opposing forces from France to Greece have emerged with the idiom of secession and return to nationalism

 What would happen if the Conservatives won in Greece? What would happen if my La Pen party continued to rise in France? Riding on a wave of fear and fear of Islam after the Sharley Abdo incident, they are also looking at ending the Schengen area under which 26 European countries can travel without passports, although the killer of Charley Abdo is France

 It is because of these conditions that the countries of Europe are now looking inwards, thinking of separate nations as a result of which their personal concerns often come in the face of conflict

 The old and respected head of a global corporate said with regret that the Third World War has started and this time it is Russia, not Germany, at the other end of the world

 Therefore, the loss in this will not be of their forces but of corporations

 lokayukta par narendra modi kii tippanee kii tulana asaram se kiye jane sambandhi congress netaa jairam ramesh ke bayaan kii bhaajapa ne somvaar ko kadi ninda karte hue ise bahut hi 'sharmnaak' bataaya
 Party spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said, 'we condemn Jairam Ramesh's lewd remarks on Modi
 yah bahut hi sharmnaak he
 ' ramesh ne bhaajapa ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi par aaj hamalaa bolte hue kaha he ki unka lokayukta par bolnaa 'asaram kaa brahmacharya ke bare main bolne kii tarah he
 ' congress netaa ne kal modi dwaara uttarakhand main ek raily ke dauraan lokapal vidheyak ko lekar rahul gandhi kaa makhul udaae jane ke bare main sawaal puche jane par yah baat kahi thi
 The Rural Development Minister, who often makes controversial statements, has compared Modi to the Asaram who is accused of sexual assault

 actor manish risinghania or 'balika vadhoo' kii choti aannadi yani avika gaur ne jab se serial 'sasuraal simer kaa' main jodi ke rup main ek saath abhinay kiya he, tab se unke phens ko unke relationships ke bare main atakalein laga rahe hai
 Please tell that Manish is much older in age than Avika
 donon ko lekar kaaphi afvaahen failin lekin yah sabhi afvaahen manish or avika kii dosti ko khatm nahin kar sakin, kyonki donon hi bahut jald ek short film main phir se saath najar aane vaale hai
 Avika said to the boyfriend in this way, Manish said in an interview to Times of India Happy Friendship Day, this rumor initially impressed me a lot, due to which i started ignoring Avika
 yah meri sabase badi bevakoofi thi
 i was feeling irritable because of all these rumors
 'balika vadhoo' kaa nayaa avatar, bal katwakar is luk main najar ain avikalekin baad main mujhe ehsaas hua ki yah sab bas ek bakawaas he kyonki mere or avika ke bich main aisa kuch nahin he or yah baat ham dono ko pataa he
 Avika is much younger than me
 vaise bhi, is tarah kii baaten ab mujhe prabhavit nahin karti hai or ab hamaari mulaakaat zyaadaatar kaam ke silsile main hi hoti he
 Avika also agrees with Manish and the two share a good chemistry together, which Avika credits to her friendship with Manish and the strong bond between them
 relationships par khulkar boleen avikamanish ke saath udati afvaah par avika kaa kahana he ki manish unke pita se sirf kuch hi saal chote hai, isliye unke bich aise kisi bhi romantic relationships kii koi gunjaaish nahin he
 Both share a unique bond of friendship, which is beyond the understanding of the rest
 avika ke mutabik dono kii aapasi samaj, ek duusare ke liye sammaan, eemaandaaree or bonding kii vajah se hi donon ab tak saath he
 From the talks of Avika and Manish, it seems that there is really nothing between the two, but the fans will continue to speculate about them

 ) Shatrughan Sinha shrugs his hand towards the crowd of people shouting, shoving and dancing enthusiastically on both sides of the road and people respond enthusiastically to his greeting
 ji haa, yah najaara he patna ke sthaneey ilaakon main sinha ke prachaar kaa
 They see this crowd with great satisfaction as their support
 ve apane maathe se pasinaa ponchhate hai or unka kafila aage apni manzil ke liye bad jaataa he
 On seeing it, it is known that they are a little tired but they know the value of this flowing sweat
 tabhi to kehete hai, ''mujhe yahaan apane khilaaf koi muqabla najar nahin aata
 Shatrughan Sinha fiercely attacks the UPA government in his public meetings for patronizing the corrupt and making false promises to the poor
 sinha parisemen ke baad bani patna sahib sansadeey seat se bhaajapa kii tikat par chunaav maidan main hai
 It is considered to be an urban population dominated parliamentary constituency
 yahaan lagbhag 8
 There are 85 lakh voters
 or majboot kad-lathi vaale ye raajnneetik, jinhen bihari babu ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, is baat se aashwast najar aate hai ki ve agar record jeet nahin to badi jeet jarur darj karenge
 "I am not respected and accepted because i am a film star," he claims
 main hameshaa apane logon ke saath har pal bana rahata hum
 And so they have been supporting me
 ''ab baat ko aage badhaate hai
 a beautiful man wearing a designer shirt just a few kilometers away does not agree with this
 yah shaks hai shekhar suman jo sinha ke khilaaf congress ummidavaar hai
 Sitting comfortably at his Patna residence, Suman told India Today, "it's all about words
" jaraa sinha se puuchhie to sahi ki unke bataur kendriya swasthya mantri ke kaarykaal ke dauraan bihar main kitne aspataalon kaa nirmaan yaa vikaas kiya gaya
 And what did he do for the state even when he was the shipping minister
 iskaa unke paas koi jawaab nahin ho saktaa kyonki unhone kuch kiya hi nahin
 "suman further adds," When there is a period of tremendous economic growth and positivity in other parts of the country, Bihar reminds us of India being backward
 hamen un logon ko rasta dikhaa dena chahie jo apane vaadon par khare nahin utre hai
 "to convert his film status into political power, he also appears as confident as Sinha
" ve kuch sochate hai or uske baad unke chehre par achaanak vyangyatmak muskaan aa jaati he or ve kehete hai, ''yah baat mat bhoolanaa ki mere bade bhai (shatrughna sinha) isse pehle kabhi koi chunaav nahin jite hai balki ek chunaav haar hi chuke hai
 While i am just getting started
 '' isse saaf he ki ve apane vipakshi kii dukhati rag ko chhedana chaahate hai
 Incidentally, Sinha's first attempt to gain entry to the Lok Sabha was in vain
 1992 main, nai dilli loksabhaa seat ke liye hue upachunaav main unhen congress ke rajesh khanna ke haathon shikast jhelni padi thi
 The Lok Sabha elections were held for this parliamentary constituency after LK Advani resigned
 isamen koi tajjub nahin ki suman ke samarthak samanthaayen dhundhane main bhi kisi se peeche nahin hai
 They are also Bollywood stars like Rajesh Khanna
 unke sahyogi kehete hai, ''itihaas hameshaa khud ko doharaata he
 "if the first principle of war is to know and highlight the shortcomings of his opponent, then Suman has done his work well
" yahi nahin, agar sinha yahaan lokapriyata ke sirmaur hai to suman bhi unase peeche nahin hai
 An example of this is Suman on Google 0
 27 second main 1,92,000 search rigelt hai
 It is also no surprise that the results of this Lok Sabha seat remain the center of interest for both these film personalities from Patna Sahib
 beshak chaahe ek filmi hasti hone yaa raajnneetik hone ke kaaran aisa ho lekin suman jabardast bheed khinch rahe hai joki unki kai filmon ke saath nahin ho sakaa tha
 Suman claims, "when the best coaches felt that my time to make a six pack had passed, i did it at that time
 album ke bazaar main aane se pehle maine rojaanaa teen ghante kaa riyaaz kiya
 i am a strict human being
 ''beshak ve ho sakate hai lekin sinha bhi unase peeche nahin hai
 Possibly also some stubborn
 tabhi to party kii aadhikarik ghoshnaa se pehle hi unhone khud ko patna sahib se bhaajapa ummidavaar ke rup main taiyaar ghoshit kar diya tha
 He was also successful in getting tickets while shocking his opponents
 suman kaa chunaav maidan main aana bhi vaaki itani hi chaunkaane vaali ghatana he
 The Congress brought him down from Patna Sahib because he did not have any suitable candidate to answer Sinha
 par kya acha hona hi suman ke liye kaaphi rahegaa?is baat par kai logon ko shubahaa he
 These people believe that Suman has started a career from a party which has been completely inactive in Bihar for the last two decades
 suman khud vajandaar ho sakate hai lekin unhone sahi party main jane ke liye galat vakt kaa chayan kiya ho saktaa he
 Some analysts believe that Suman has failed to put forth a strong plan for change and has placed more trust in the Congress and his personality
 iske alaava ve puri tarah se aakraamak bhi nahin hai
 But Suman sarcastically says, "I too will change gears
" dekhte rahiega
 "on the other hand, Sinha also has no less problems
 bhaajapa main hi ek dhada aisa he jo unhen patna sahib se saansad banate hue nahin dekhnaa chahta
 But not paying much attention to this, he says, "I know some people are opposing me
" raajnneeti main aapako vipakshiyon or apni party ke bheetar bhi virodh kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 There is no need to worry about it
 kabhi-kabhaar aapaki lokapriyata main kuch log apni asuraksha dekhte hai
 "but it is so clear that some people might think Sinha is going a few steps ahead
 ve nitish kumaar ko majboot karne ke naam par bhi vot maang rahe hai
 It is believed that his relationship with Nitish Kumar is not very good
 haalanki sinha ne kisi prakaar kii daraar se inkaar kiya he
 He praises Nitish, saying, "we have a wonderful relationship and there is no rift of any kind
" ''ek baat yah dekhne laayak he ki filmon se raajnneeti main aae donon hi star netaaon par ek hi kism kaa aarope lag rahaa he
 They are being called "outsiders"
 patna sahib seat se rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ke ummidavaar vijay sahu donon hi ko ek hi taraazoo main taul rahe hai
 He says that these two have nothing to do with Bihar
 rajd kii prachaar samiti ke adhyaksh ramkripal yadav kehete hai, ''patna ke logon ko in do sitaron par apane vot ko bekaar nahin karnaa chahie
 They will return to Mumbai
 '' lekin ise sinha or suman ke taqatvar tarkon kaa nateeja hi mana jayega ki unhone is masale ko adhik tool nahin pakadaney di he
 But the heat of the election has made it clear that it is no longer a theoretical matter
 jaisaa ki shuru main donon ne hi vaada kiya tha
 If you raise a question about Suman, then there is a possibility that you will see some embers in Sinha's eyes for a moment
 sinha napa-tula jawaab dete hai, ''mujhe nahin pataa aakhir vah (shekhar suman) kyon chale aae
 Don't know who has sent them here
 kal tak to ve bhaajapa main shaamil hone kii koshish kar rahe the
 Now overnight, he filed his nomination before joining the Congress
 ''apni bheed bhari agali jansabha main jane se pehle sinha muskaraate hue haath milaate hai
 And finally, in his style, standing on the footrest of his SUV and spreading his arms and greeting
 vahiin patna ke ek-duusare kone main, suman motorcycle par savaar ho kar logon ke bich prachaar karne main vyast hai
 And the noise of youth is deafening
 lekin suman unke saath baatcheet karte hai
 That is, both the stars are fully engaged to defeat each other in the war of power

 Modi said, "we have to make a long-term policy in this regard so that the eyes and attitudes of the common man can be changed

 The song is sung by Dev Negi and Paroma Das Gupta
 is gane ko compoj kiya he charantan bhatta ne
 Akshay and Shruti Zoro are seen making noise in the promotion of this film, which is going to release on May 1
 is film kaa pehle naam 'gabbar' rakhaa gaya tha lekin baad ise badalakar'gabbar ij back'kar diya gaya
 Watch the film 'gabbar Is Back' by 'drinking Coffee Drinks': bihar main bhartiya janata party kii haar yaa jeet par pradhanmantri narendra modi kii pratishtha daanv par lagi he
 This is not of his opponents but of his party's president Amit Shah himself
 patna main guuruuvaar ko party kii raily main netaaon ke bhaashan main jitna aatmavishvaas nahin jhalak rahaa tha usase zyada chunaav ke parinaam ko lekar bechaini dikh rahi thi
 The beginning was reflected in the speech of Sushil Modi, the senior leader of Bihar and the most powerful contender for the post of Chief Minister, when he promised that the Nitish government would increase the salary by 25 per cent more than any employee or people associated with the government
 Will give their government
 susheel modi 8 varshon tak bihar ke vitt mantri rahe hai
 If Nitish Kumar or Lalu Yadav had made the same claim, they would have definitely questioned where the money will come for it
 lekin, apni baari aane par wo iskaa jawaab dena usee prakaar aavashyak nahin samajhate kii jaise wo janata dal united ke prachaar par ho rahe kharch ke bare main prashn to jarur uthaate hai, lekin bijepi ke prachaar ke liye paise kahaan se aa rahe hai, uske bare main kisi ko jaanakri dene kii jarurat nahin samajhate
 The BJP posters that were put up before Amit Shah's speech, it was clear that BJP does not need any Muslim leader at the moment
 bhale shahanvaj hossain patna medical college hospital main short circuit se lagane vaali aag ke liye nitish kumaar ke khilaaf bayaanbaji karen yaa gaanv-gaanv or vidhansabha kshetron main ghumkar prachaar karen yaa party ke har netaa ke iftaar party ke liye dilli-patna daud lagaate rahen, lekin filhal party ke nae chunaav ke baazeegaron ko unki jarurat nahin
 It is being interpreted that like the Lok Sabha elections, in Bihar also the BJP will try to contest on the issue of Hindutva, in which the polarization of Muslim voters towards nitish-lalu, in response to which the voters of Hindu society BJP Be rounded to the side
 saath hi bijepi ne bihari babu ko apane poster yaa stage se jaise dur rakhaa usase ye baat spasht ho gai he ki modi-saah kii team ko adwani samarthak yaa unase jude logon kii koi jarurat nahin or agar wo coup bhawan main hai to rahen
 It was clear from Amit Shah's speech that even though BJP leaders are having to make a new argument every day for not releasing the caste census report, if the election is in Bihar, then Prime Minister Modi is backward and also backward class Come, so on this basis also BJP will ask for votes
 bhale bijepi ke netaa kahen ki chunaav vikaas par hoga, lekin vikaas ke mudde par bijepi ke netaaon kaa maananaa he ki jitna vaada unhone kiya use puraa nahin kar paae or jin yojanaon ko wo apni uplabdhi gina rahe hai, unamem se anek upie ke shashan kaal main shuru kiye gaye
 Yes, it was clear from Shah's speech that the target of Lalu Yadav and Rabri Devi's reign over Nitish would be especially Jungle Raj because the more Jungle Raj they talk about, the more votes will be mobilized in their favor
 lekin, iskaa doosraa paksh yah he ki lalu ke paksh main paswan ne jitani baar safai di he, media ke saamne unhen nirdosh bataaya he, uskaa tepe janata main chalane ke baad shayad janata main is aarope kii dhar or kamjor hogi
 The comments saath hi unke gathbandhan main shaamil jithan ram maanjhi ke khilaaf bijepi netaaon susheel modi, nand kishori yadav or mangal pandeya ne jitne bayaan die use public main dikhaaya jane laga to shayad bijepi ke liye ye chaal ulti pad sakati he
 Yes, Amit Shah has indicated in his speech that next week when Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Muzaffarpur in Bihar, he will announce a big plan for Bihar
 lekin, bakaul bijepi netaa susheel modi, chunavi varsha main chunaav ke ain maukey par kii gai ghoshnaaon kaa janata par bahut jyada asar nahin hota
 The rest of the leaders of Janata Dal United are also sitting here, if they believe that Modi had announced in Purnia of Koshi region of Bihar before becoming Prime Minister that Bihar would get special state status, special economic package and What will happen to that promise if special attention is given? shuruyaat bihar ke varisht netaa or mukhyamantri pad ke sabase prabal daavedaar susheel modi ke bhaashan main dikhaa, jab unhone ye vaada kiya ki nitish sarkaar kisi karmchaaree yaa sarkaar se jude logon ko jitna vetan badhane kaa vaada kar rahi he, usase 25 pratishat zyada badha kar unki sarakar degi
 Sushil Modi has been the Finance Minister of Bihar for 8 years
 agar yahi daawa nitish kumaar yaa lalu yadav ne kiya hota to wo jarur sawaal karte ki iske liye paisa kahaan se aayega
 But, when it comes to his turn, he does not think it necessary to answer it in the same way as he does raise questions about the expenditure on the publicity of the Janata Dal United, but from where the money is coming for the promotion of the BJP
 Don't understand the need to give information about anyone
 amit shah ke bhaashan se pehle jo bijepi ke poster lage the, usase saafe tha ki bijepi ko philhal kisi muslim netaa kii koi jarurat nahin
 Be it Shahnawaz Hussain, make a statement against Nitish Kumar for a short circuit fire at Patna Medical College Hospital, or campaign in every village and assembly constituency or keep running delhi-patna for Iftar Party of every party leader
 But at present, the jugglers of the new elections of the party do not need them
 iskaa ek arth lagaaya ja rahaa he ki loksabhaa chunaavon kii tarah bihar main bhi bijepi kii koshish hogi hindutv ke mudde par chunaav ladaa jaae, jisamen muslim matadaataaon ke nitish-lalu ke prati dhruvikaran kii baat kii jaae, jisaki pratikriya main hindu samaaj ke matadaata bijepi ke paksh main golband hon
 Also, the way BJP kept Bihari Babu away from his poster or stage, it has become clear that Modi-sah's team has no need of Advani supporters or people associated with them and if they are in Kop Bhawan then stay
 amit shah ke bhaashan se spasht tha ki bhale bijepi ke netaaon ko jaateey janaganana kii report jari naa karne ke liye har din ek nayaa tark dena pad rahaa ho, lekin agar chunaav bihar main he to pradhanmantri modi pichhadaa bhi hai or ati pichhadaa varg se bhi aate hai, isliye is aadhaar par bhi bijepi vot maangegi
 Although the BJP leaders will say that the election will be on development, but on the issue of development, BJP leaders believe that they could not fulfill the promise they promised and many of the schemes which they are counting their achievement, many of them during the UPA rule
 Were introduced in
 haa, shah ke bhaashan se spasht tha ki unke nishane par nitish se zyada lalu yadav or rabari devi kaa shasankaal khaskar jangal raaj rahegaa kyonki jitna jangal raaj kii baat karenge utana voter unke paksh main lamaband hoga
 But, the other side of it is that the number of times Paswan has given a clarification in favor of Lalu, telling him innocent in front of the media, the tape of his allegation will be further weakened after his tapes are played in public
 tippaniyan Also, the statements made by BJP leaders Sushil Modi, Nand Kishori Yadav and Mangal Pandey against Jitan Ram Manjhi in their alliance are shown in public, then this move can be reversed for the BJP
 haa, amit shah ne apane bhaashan main ye sanket diya he ki agle hafte pradhanmantri narendra modi jab bihar ke mujffarpur kaa daura karenge tab bihar ke liye badi badi yojana kii ghoshnaa karenge
 But, BJP leader Sushil Modi, the announcements made at the last moment of election in the rain of elections do not have much impact on the public
 baaki yahaan bhi janata dal united ke netaaon kii maane to wo taiyaari karke baithe hai ki modi ne pradhanmantri banane se pehle bihar ke kosi kshetra ke purniya main ye ghoshnaa kii thi ki bijepi sarkaar aane par bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja, vishesh aarthik package or vishesh dhyaan diya jayega to us vaade kaa kya hua? If Nitish Kumar or Lalu Yadav had made the same claim, they would have definitely questioned where the money will come for it
 lekin, apni baari aane par wo iskaa jawaab dena usee prakaar aavashyak nahin samajhate kii jaise wo janata dal united ke prachaar par ho rahe kharch ke bare main prashn to jarur uthaate hai, lekin bijepi ke prachaar ke liye paise kahaan se aa rahe hai, uske bare main kisi ko jaanakri dene kii jarurat nahin samajhate

 bhale bijepi ke netaa kahen ki chunaav vikaas par hoga, lekin vikaas ke mudde par bijepi ke netaaon kaa maananaa he ki jitna vaada unhone kiya use puraa nahin kar paae or jin yojanaon ko wo apni uplabdhi gina rahe hai, unamem se anek upie ke shashan kaal main shuru kiye gaye
 Yes, it was clear from Shah's speech that the target of Lalu Yadav and Rabri Devi's reign over Nitish would be especially Jungle Raj because the more Jungle Raj they talk about, the more votes will be mobilized in their favor
 lekin, iskaa doosraa paksh yah he ki lalu ke paksh main paswan ne jitani baar safai di he, media ke saamne unhen nirdosh bataaya he, uskaa tepe janata main chalane ke baad shayad janata main is aarope kii dhar or kamjor hogi
 The comments saath hi unke gathbandhan main shaamil jithan ram maanjhi ke khilaaf bijepi netaaon susheel modi, nand kishori yadav or mangal pandeya ne jitne bayaan die use public main dikhaaya jane laga to shayad bijepi ke liye ye chaal ulti pad sakati he
 Yes, Amit Shah has indicated in his speech that next week when Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Muzaffarpur in Bihar, he will announce a big plan for Bihar
 lekin, bakaul bijepi netaa susheel modi, chunavi varsha main chunaav ke ain maukey par kii gai ghoshnaaon kaa janata par bahut jyada asar nahin hota
 The rest of the leaders of Janata Dal United are also sitting here, if they believe that Modi had announced in Purnia of Koshi region of Bihar before becoming Prime Minister that Bihar would get special state status, special economic package and What will happen to that promise if special attention is given? amit shah ke bhaashan se pehle jo bijepi ke poster lage the, usase saafe tha ki bijepi ko philhal kisi muslim netaa kii koi jarurat nahin
 Be it Shahnawaz Hussain, make a statement against Nitish Kumar for a short circuit fire at Patna Medical College Hospital, or campaign in every village and assembly constituency or keep running delhi-patna for Iftar Party of every party leader
 But at present, the jugglers of the new elections of the party do not need them
 iskaa ek arth lagaaya ja rahaa he ki loksabhaa chunaavon kii tarah bihar main bhi bijepi kii koshish hogi hindutv ke mudde par chunaav ladaa jaae, jisamen muslim matadaataaon ke nitish-lalu ke prati dhruvikaran kii baat kii jaae, jisaki pratikriya main hindu samaaj ke matadaata bijepi ke paksh main golband hon
 Also, the way BJP kept Bihari Babu away from his poster or stage, it has become clear that Modi-sah's team has no need of Advani supporters or people associated with them and if they are in Kop Bhawan then stay
 amit shah ke bhaashan se spasht tha ki bhale bijepi ke netaaon ko jaateey janaganana kii report jari naa karne ke liye har din ek nayaa tark dena pad rahaa ho, lekin agar chunaav bihar main he to pradhanmantri modi pichhadaa bhi hai or ati pichhadaa varg se bhi aate hai, isliye is aadhaar par bhi bijepi vot maangegi
 Although the BJP leaders will say that the election will be on development, but on the issue of development, BJP leaders believe that they could not fulfill the promise they promised and many of the schemes which they are counting their achievement, many of them during the UPA rule

 haa, shah ke bhaashan se spasht tha ki unke nishane par nitish se zyada lalu yadav or rabari devi kaa shasankaal khaskar jangal raaj rahegaa kyonki jitna jangal raaj kii baat karenge utana voter unke paksh main lamaband hoga
 But, the other side of it is that the number of times Paswan has given a clarification in favor of Lalu, telling him innocent in front of the media, the tape of his allegation will be further weakened after his tapes are played in public
 tippaniyan Also, the statements made by BJP leaders Sushil Modi, Nand Kishori Yadav and Mangal Pandey against Jitan Ram Manjhi in their alliance are shown in public, then this move can be reversed for the BJP
 haa, amit shah ne apane bhaashan main ye sanket diya he ki agle hafte pradhanmantri narendra modi jab bihar ke mujffarpur kaa daura karenge tab bihar ke liye badi badi yojana kii ghoshnaa karenge
 But, BJP leader Sushil Modi, the announcements made at the last moment of election in the rain of elections do not have much impact on the public
 baaki yahaan bhi janata dal united ke netaaon kii maane to wo taiyaari karke baithe hai ki modi ne pradhanmantri banane se pehle bihar ke kosi kshetra ke purniya main ye ghoshnaa kii thi ki bijepi sarkaar aane par bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja, vishesh aarthik package or vishesh dhyaan diya jayega to us vaade kaa kya hua? It is being interpreted that like the Lok Sabha elections, in Bihar also the BJP will try to contest on the issue of Hindutva, in which the polarization of Muslim voters towards nitish-lalu, in response to which the voters of Hindu society BJP Be rounded to the side

 It starts with Bhanwar Singh Porte, the big tribal leader who won the 1972, 1977 and 1980 elections and hit a hat-trick
 1985 main party ne unka tikat kaat diya or congress ke dinadayal vidhayak bane
 Angered Bhanwar Singh left the Congress and joined the BJP and became an MLA in 1990
 1993 main phir bijepi ne unka tikat kaat diya or congress ke pahalwaan singh maravi is seat se vidhayak bane
 Such a stronghold of Jogi, since 2001, this Legislative Assembly remained as Jogi
 2003, 2008 main ajit jogi lagaataar yahaan se vidhayak rahe
 In 2013, Amit Jogi left this seat
 ab 2018 main amit pita ke liye seat chhod rahe he
 Political history shows that even though BJP MLA has been elected twice from here, it is a Congressman
 haalanki amit jogi maanate hai ki ye congress kaa nahin balki jogi kaa garh he
 The agony of Marwahi, 150 km from Bilaspur, is that the tribal development here is so far away from its district headquarters, where it does not dare to reach
 lihaaja naa to unhen sarkari yojanaon kii jaankaree milti he or na hi unka sahi tarah se kriyanvayan hota he
 As a result, this backward area is falling further backward
 chhattisgarh ke bare menapako bataa den ki chhattisgarh main kul 90 vidhansabha siten hai
 The state currently has a total of 11 Lok Sabha and 5 Rajya Sabha seats
 chhattisgarh main kul 27 jile hai

 2013 chunaav main kya the nattejey2013 main vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey 8 disambar ko ghoshit kiye gaye the
 Among them, the Bharatiya Janata Party formed the government by defeating the Congress for the third consecutive time in the state
 raman singh kii aguwai main bijepi ko 2013 main kul 49 vidhansabha siton par jeet mili thi
 While the Congress was able to win only 39 seats
 jabaki 2 siten anya dalon ke khate main gai thim
 Despite the BJP getting three seats less than in 2008, they formed their government with an absolute majority
 raman singh 2003 se rajya ke mukhyamantri hai
 Despite making a strong comeback in the second half, the Indian team failed to secure a direct entry into next year's World Cup with a 3-4 defeat against South Korea in the final of the Ninth Asia Cup hockey tournament
 holland ke hegg main agle saal hone vaale toornament main sidhe pravesh ke liye bharat ke liye yah toornament jeetna jaruri tha
 The team, however, does not have to be despondent, as their entry into the World Cup is almost certain despite the defeat
 korea ke chauthe khitaab se malaysia kii 12 saal ke baad vishwa cap main vaapasi tay ho gai he
 India will now have to wait for the official confirmation of their representation in the FIH World Cup to conclude the Osiana Cup in November, with Australia and New Zealand likely to win
 australia or newjiland pehle hi vishwa cap ke liye kwalifai kar chuke hai or aise main in donon main se kisi ek ke toornament jeetne par bharat ko rigerv ke taur par vishwa cap main jagah milegi
 Korea scored goals in Jeng Jong Hyun (28th minute), Yoo Hyeok Seok (29th minute), Naim Hyun Woo (57th minute) and Kang Moon Wyeon (68th minute)
 bharat kii taraf se roopinder paal singh (48wein minute), nickin thimaiya (57wein minute) or mandeep singh (64wein minute) ne gol kiye
 The British Parliament has released a 250-page document
 yah darasal fasebuk par america main kiye gaye mukademe kii copy he
 According to the report, Facebook has made every effort to stop the release of this document, but British Member of Parliament Parliamentarian Damien Collins has said that it has been posted online keeping in mind the public interest
 is dastavej main fasebuk ke internal imels or duusare documents hai jinhen fasebuk or ek ap develpar ke bich chal rahe mukademe ke baad sil karne kaa aadesh diya gaya tha
 What is there in this document because of which Facebook wants to stop the release of it
 is puure dastavej main do findings hai – pehla data privesi ko lekar or doosraa compatishan he
 Facebook was sued due to data privacy and this document has come to Lime Lite
 yah dastavej 2012 kaa he or exparts kah rahe hai is dastavej ko samajhakar yah kaha ja saktaa he ki fasebuk apane growth ke liye yujar kii privesi daanv par laga saktaa he
 Member of Parliament Damian Collins tweeted
 isamen unhone likhaa he, ‘mujhe lagata he ki is dastavej ko jari karnaa janhit main he
 This document raises serious questions on Facebook user data treated by Facebook
 kis tarah se fasebuk ap developers ke saath kaam karata he, company kii policy kya he or kaise wo soshal media market main raaj kar rahe hai’aapako bataa den ki kii vahaan kii ek kamity fasebuk privesi ko lekar jaanch kar rahi he or isi kram main six4tree ap develpar se dastavej hasil kiya gaya he
 It is being told that in this document it is clearly that the company gives access to user data to its particular developers by going against the policy
 fasebuk ke ek pravaktaa ne kaha he, ‘ye dastavej bhraamak hai
 Like other businesses, we also have many internal conversions
 inamen un tareekon par baat hoti he jisase ham apane bijness model ko thik dhang se chalaa saken
 But the fact is clear that we have never sold people's data
 There is an app developer called six4three which used to collect information about the user's Facebook friends
 is develpar ne fasebuk par mukadmaa kiya, kyonki fasebuk ne 2015 main is ap ko fasebuk se block kar diya
 In technical terms, Facebook blocked API access
 aisa hi API cambridge analitica kaa tha jo fasebuk se lagbhag 87 million yugers kii jaankaree avaidh tareeke se ikaithi kii
 According to the report, from this document, it is understood that Facebook was thinking about how to manage the collected data and how to make money from it
 isse pehle bhi wal street jarnal kii ek report ke mutabik kuch adhikari yujar data ke acces ko bechney ke bare main soch rahe the
 It is also in this document that Facebook had a special deal with some developers so that they continue to access user data even after the strictness of Facebook
 kangana ranut kii film manikarnika: da queen of jhaansi 25 janvari ko relies hui
 Critics and fans liked the movie
 lekin rani lakshmibai kii jindagi ke sangharsh par bani film par bollywood maun rahaa
 Neither any celebrity promoted Kangana's film nor did Manikarnika review
 iske khilaaf kangana ne bhi aawaaj uthaai
 Fans also questioned the silence of Bollywood

 Indeed, Mini watched the film Gully Boy, released on 14 February
 movie dekhne ke baad mini ne ranvir singh or aalia bhatta kii tarifon ke pul baandhte hue ek twit kiya
 Then a follower of Mini's applied her class and asked why she had not seen Manikarnika till now
 yujar ne likhaa- ''mini maathur aapaki soch bhi mini he
 You got time to watch Gully Boy but you didn't write a single word for Manikarnika

 Delhi Daredevils defeated Mumbai Indians in Ferozeshah Kotla on Sunday to break their dream of making it to the playoffs
 dilli ne chaar wicket par 174 ran kaa score khadaa kiya
 Mumbai Indians team 19 in response
 3 over main 163 ranon par simat gai or 'karo yaa maro' kaa muqabla 11 ranon se ganvaa baithi
 Chasing the target, at one time the Mumbai Indians team was 74 for 2 wickets in the 9th over, but on the same score, they came under pressure after losing two wickets

 , But he was falling out of the boundary, throwing the ball to Trent Boult, who caught it
 isi over main krunal pandya bhi pavilion laut gaye
 Mumbai's score was reduced to 78 for five from 74 for three
 captain rohit sharma (13) or hardik pandya (27) ne chathe wicket ke liye 43 ran jode, lekin team ko jeet ke kareeb nahin le ja sake
 Once again, the same twin catches of Maxwell and Bolt were seen

 Running to his left, Maxwell once again caught the catch, but he threw the ball towards Bolt before going out of his own boundary
 aakhirkaar bolt ne us kaich ko puraa kiya
 That is, these two twin catches can be considered the best catches of this IPL

 Tug of war between bjp-shiv Sena in Maharashtra, key to power in Maharashtra NCP is in the hands of bjp-shiv Sena in Maharashtra
 shivasena 50-50 formule se ek kadam peeche hatane ko taiyaar nahin he to bijepi siem pad ko har haal main apane paas rakhana chaahati he
 In such a situation, the power of Maharashtra is in the hands of NCP, which won 54 seats under the leadership of Sharad Pawar
 aise main sharad pavaar bijepi yaa shivasena main jiske saath khadey ho jaaen, siem kii kursi uske haath main hogi
 Despite being in the role of kingmaker, NCP chief Sharad Pawar and all NCP leaders agree to sit in the opposition more than form a government
 haalanki chagan bhujabal ne shivasena ko bijepi se naata todakar ensipi ke saath aane kaa nimantran diya he
 All eyes are on such stand of NCP
 ensipi vipaksh main baithne par kaayam rahati he to phir shivasena ke paas bijepi ke saath sarkaar banane ke sivaa koi or vikalp nahin bachegaa
 Shiv Sena is still standing on its stand for the post of Chief Minister of Maharashtra
 shivasena netaa sanjay rautane somvaar ko ek baar phir bijepi ko gathbandhan dharm nibhaane kii yaad dilaai or kaha ki bijepi ko 50-50 formule ko nibhaana chahie
 He also opened his cards on speculation of going with NCP and said that options remain open in politics
 jabaki, bijepi pravaktaa jeviel narsimha raav ne somvaar ko kaha ki maharashtra main jald hi bijepi kii aguwai main sarkaar banegi, jo paanch saal tak chalegi
 Maharashtra BJP spokesperson Shweta Shalini said the CM belonged to the BJP, and will continue to be so
 hamaare saath 15 nirdaleey vidhayak hai
 Some more mlas from smaller parties are in touch
 maharashtra chunaav nattejey ke din hiensipi netaa chagan bhujabal ne kahatha, 'shivasena ko khulaa ofer he ki vah hamaare saath aa kar mukhyamantri kaa pad lekar sarkaar banaaen
 The Shiv Sena needs to go with the BJP and decide the post of Deputy Chief Minister or the Chief Minister's post with us
 'haalanki, ensipi supremeo sharad pavaar ne vidhansabha ke nattejey aane ke baad kisi ke saath jane se saaf manaa kar diya he
 Sharad Pawar had blunted Shiv Sena's aspirations by saying that his party did not have the option to form a government in Maharashtra, so he would sit in opposition as per the mandate
 shivasena kaa samarthan karne ke sawaal par pavaar ne kaha, 'hamaare paas aisa koi vikalp nahin he
 People have ordered us to sit in opposition
 ham janadesh ko sweekaar karte hai
 'if the NCP continues to hold the statement of sitting in the opposition, then the Shiv Sena's Chief Minister's post may revolt
 aise main bijepi ke saath milakar sarkaar banane ke sivaa uske paas koi doosraa vikalp nahin bachegaa, kyonki congress ke paas vidhayakon kii sankhya itani nahin he ki vah apane dam par shivasena ko samarthan karke sarkaar banavaa sake
 However, if the NCP goes with the BJP, then the majority figure is easily fulfilled
 ensipi or bijepi milte hai to sarkaar bananaa tay he
 Whereas, the Shiv Sena government can only make it through the congress-ncp
 is tarah se agar ensipi shivasena ke saath khadi hoti he to use congress ke samarthan kii bhi jarurat hogi
 The figure of 110 is reached after the Shiv Sena and NCP meet, but for the majority there should be 145 mlas
 aise sthiti main congress kii ranneeti par logon kii najar hogi
 Due to the ongoing tussle between the bjp-shiv Sena in Maharashtra, the NDA has not initiated the government formation in Maharashtra even after 5 days of the results
 jabaki haryana main bahumat ke kam hone par jejepi se saath milakar sarkaar bijepi ne bana lee he
 In such a situation, BJP and Shiv Sena are working to improve their equation
 aise main dekhnaa hoga ki maharashtra kii siyasat kis karavat badalati he
 Yuliya Vantur is angry with her boyfriend Salman these days
 iske peeche kaaran salmaan kaa apane 'jai ho' kii ko-star daiji shah ke saath nazdikiyaan bataai ja rahi hai
 According to the mid-day news, Yulianne has also shared her troubles with Salman and his family
 salmaan khan ne aaj tak bahut si heroinon ko bollywood main mauka diya he
 Daisy Shah also came to the movies due to Bhismalanaki
 salmaan ne unhen 2014 main 'jai ho' main launch kiya tha
 Since then Salman and Daisy have a very good relationship
 kuch dinon pehle hi salmaan nedesico ek car gift kii thi or or shaayad yahi baat ulia ko pasand nahin ai
 Daisy is now keeping distance from Salman's house
 daiji jo hameshaa gelexi apartment main najar aati thim, ab kareeb ek maheene se unhen vahaan nahin dekha gaya he
 From this it can be inferred that cold-war is going on between Daisy and Eulia
 rajyasabha main samvidhan sanshodhan (126waan) bill par charchaloksabhaa se pehle hi paas ho chukaa he yah vidheyakarajyasabha main samvidhan sanshodhan (126waan) bill par charchaa ke dauraan trinmul congress (tiemasi) ke saansad derek o bryan ne anglo indian kaa mudda uthaaya
 He said that you (government) can take the seat of 2 mps, but will never take Indians out of Anglo Indians
 saath hi unhone apane bhaashan kaa samaapan samvidhan kii kitaab ko chumkar kiya
 The bill provides for ten years extension of reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes communities in Lok Sabha and state legislatures
 iske alaava anglo indian cote se hone vaali saansad kii 2 siton ko bhi khatm karne kaa praavdhaan he
 This bill has already been passed by the Lok Sabha
 derek o bryan ne kya kaha?tiemasi saansad derek o bryan ne kaha ki sarkaar essi-asti aarakshan 10 saal ke liye badha rahi he
 This has happened 6 times before
 ham iskaa swaagat karte hai
 Our only demand is why only for 10 years
 aap 20 saal yaa 30 saal ke liye badhayen
 We will support you aap sanshodhan lie
 He said that you are doing all this here, but for the last 1 week in Bengal, you are humiliating the SC-ST
 kyonki ham vidhansabha main essi kamishan bill laana chaahate hai
 The governor there has not signed
 tiemsisaansad ne kaha ki aapke bill main jo he wo to thik he, lekin jise choda ja rahaa he main uski baat karuunga
 He then raised the issue of Anglo Indian
 unhone kaha ki anglo indian hameshaa se forward samudaay rahaa he
 i am speaking here as an Anglo Indian
 ye bahut chota samudaay he
 3 to 3 5 lakh log hai
 Our community is small, but very effective
 pichley 72 saal main sirf ek anglo indian yahaan par chunakar bheja gaya
 Only Mamata Banerjee did this
 sena, railway jaise sansthaanon main anglo indian kaam karte hai
 He said that you can take the seat of 2 mps from us
 lekin kabhi bhi anglo indian main se indian nahin le paaenge
 This is not just the case of Anglo Indians
 ye mudda bada he
 He then kissed the constitutional book and concluded the speech

 maharashtra main siton ke bantwaare ko lekar congress or ensipi ke bich ab tak koi samjhauta nahin ho sakaa
 The party could not reach any conclusion in the meeting held at 10 Janpath, Sonia Gandhi's residence till late in the night
 vaise baithak ke baad maharashtra ke mukhyamantri ashok chavaan ne kaha ki jald hi samjhaute kaa elaan kar diya jayega
 Congress leaders are divided among themselves over the seat-sharing in Maharashtra
 dilli main buudhvaar der raat tak chali baithak ke baad 10 janpath se bhale hi ensipi ke saath samjhaute par aage badhane kaa sanket mil gaya, lekin ensipi or congress kis formule ko apanaayenge ye ab tak tay nahin ho paaya he
 If sources are to be believed, Deshmukh Camp in Maharashtra wants the formula to be the same as last time, that is, NCP will contest 21 seats and Congress will contest 27
 lekin mukhyamantri ashok chavaan kaa khemaa isi formule ke saath koi bich kaa rasta nikaalane ke paksh main he
 a way has also been suggested that RPI leader Ramdas Athawale be given a place in the Congress quota this time
 is tarah ensipi kii baat bhi rah jaaegi auki formula bhi nahin badalegaa
 But some Congress leaders of Maharashtra are also airing that if the Congress contests alone, it will be beneficial
 lekin sawaal he ki kya congress maharashtra main sarkaar auki gathbandhan donon ganvaane ko taiyaar hogi
 Things do not look like this
 vaise mana ja rahaa he ki agle do dinon main samjhaute kaa elaan ho jayega
 The Central Government has once again welcomed the reinstatement of Alok Verma to the post of Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne supreme court ke faisle par kaha ki sarkaar ne sibiai kii saakh bachaane ke liye sivisi kii sifarish ke aadhaar par faisla liya tha
 He said that the central government had sent both top CBI officials on leave only on the basis of the recommendations of the CVC
 arun jetali ne kaha ki ham supreme court ke faisle kaa paalan karenge, haalanki abhi sarkaar is faisle kaa adhyayan karegi
 He also said that this matter is not over yet
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar kaa kisi vyakti vishesh ke paksh yaa nishpaksh main ravaiya nahin he, jab aarope lagane ke baad sivisi kii sifarish par hi sarkaar ne kaam kiya tha
 On the Supreme Court's decision, the Finance Minister said that this has given protection to the director of CBI
 jo maamla chal rahaa tha usamen aarope-pratyarope kaa daur chal rahaa tha
 He also said that there are two ways in the CBI case
 pehle main agar transfar se judaa maamla hota he to hai level cameti ke paas jaataa he, lekin bhrashtachar se judaa koi maamla he to sivisi kii sifarish par bhi kaam ho saktaa he
 Arun Jaitley said that the government's goal was only to save the autonomy of the CBI
 gauratlab he ki supreme court ne mangalvaar ko bada faisla sunaate hue centre sarkaar ke us aadesh ko radd kar diya tha, jisamen alok verma ko chuttee par bheja gaya tha
 After this order of the Supreme Court, Alok Verma will be reinstated as the Director of CBI, while Rakesh Asthana, Nageswara Rao will be reinstated as Special Director
 aapako bataa den ki supreme court ke is faisle ko vipaksh ne modi sarkaar ke liye bada jhatka qaraar diya he

 Amidst these voices of discontent emerging from many levels, the party's national general secretary Ram Madhav has hinted towards bjp's plan-b in view of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 yah aisa rodmap he, jiske jariye bijepi sahyogi dalon kii naaraazgi se har nuksaan kii bharpai kii koshish main he
 This plan-b is indicated by the talk of senior party leader Ram Madhav

 At the same time, in Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti did not derail, the BJP withdrew support in August, due to which the government has gone away from the BJP due to the fall of the government
 vahiin,haal main bihar main bhi jhatka laga, jab vahaan apane swajaatiyour obisimtadaataaon ke bich prabhaavshaalee upendra kushvaha ne bhi saath chhodane kaa faisla kar liya

 apana dal ne party kii samasyaayein sheersh str se dur na hone kii sthiti main upi main sabhi sarkari kaaryakramon ke bahishkaar kii chetavanee di he
 However, Ram Madhav has not named any new possible party joining the NDA

 At the same time, the discussions of the film actor Rajinikanth, who entered politics, also intensified discussions with the BJP

 haalanki, rajyasabha ke dipti spikar pad ke chunaav ke dauraan unki party bijd ne endie ummidavaar harivansh narayan singh ko samarthan diya tha
 Then PM Narendra Modi spoke to Chief Minister Patnaik and sought support

 It is believed that the BJP is trying to compensate the loss from the parties going away by bringing these parties with them
 pichley dinon biguef ke teen javaanon par chalati train main ek naaballig ladki se kathith taur par balaatkaar karne kaa aarope lagaaya gaya
 In this case, an army jawan was taken into custody by the Railway Police of Madhupur in Jharkhand and the search for two others was on

 But the ground reality is that most Muslims consider the Akhilesh-led coalition to be in the best position to challenge the BJP
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha kii 403 siton main se kareeb 130 se 135 siten aisi hai jahaan musalamaanon kaa vot nirnaayak sabit hota he
 Most of these seats are in western Uttar Pradesh, lowland areas and eastern Uttar Pradesh
 yahaan musalamaanon kaa bharosa hasil kiye bina kisi bhi ummidavaar ke liye jeet hasil karnaa mushkil he
 Betting on sp-congress alliance in western Uttar Pradesh? It is true that a large section of Muslims have been angry with the Akhilesh government since the Muzaffarnagar riots
 lav jihad, kairana palaayan or dharmantaran jaise muddon par bhi musalmaan akhilesh sarkaar ke ravaiye se naakhush dikhe
 This is the reason that in the recent past, the trend of Muslims in western Uttar Pradesh was shifting towards BSP instead of Samajwadi Party
 lekin ab samaajawaadee party kaa gathbandhan congress ke saath ho jane se tasviir badal sakati he
 In western Uttar Pradesh, seats like Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur, Meerut, Baghpat, Hapur and Ghaziabad are now seen changing equations
 musalamaanon kaa bada tabaka akhilesh nit gathbandhan kii taraf ja saktaa he
 But here Muslim voters also do not forget to say that whoever is seen defeating BJP at the last moment, their vote will go the same way
 yani kai siton par bispi kaa ummidavaar shashakt dikhne par muslim matadaata uske naam par bhi batan dabaa sakate hai
 Most of the Muslims in Meerut district are seen to be towards the sp-congress alliance
 lekin saath hi haji yaqub jis seat se ummidavaar hai vahaan musalmaan bispi ko vot kar sakate hai
 The same can be said for other strong BSP candidates
 pashchimi upi kii baat kii jaae to yahaan isamen muslim matadaataaon kii sankhya acchhee khaasi he
 The number of Muslim voters in Meerut and its surrounding districts varies from 35 to 45 percent
 bijanour jile main musalamaanon kii sankhya kareeb 40 fisadi he
 In Meerut, the Muslim vote is 35 to 40 percent, while in Muzaffarnagar it is about 35 percent
 hapur main musalamaanon kaa pratishat lagbhag 35 se 40 pratishat he
 The number of Muslims in Baghpat is around 35 percent
 in sabhi jilon main espi-congress gathbandhan musalamaanon kii pehali pasand he, duusare nambar par bispi najar aati he
 But this choice may also change, given the strength of the candidates
 meerut main musalamaanon kii pehali pasand aaj bhi akhilesh yadav hai
 Muslims in Meerut like to vote for the sp-congress alliance
 akhilesh ko nae yug kaa secular netaa bataate hue zyaadaatar muslim votaron kaa rukh unki taraf he
 He says that Akhilesh likes him and that of Akhilesh
 chaatro ko laptop vitaran jaisi yojanaon ko chalaakar yuva matadaataaon main bhi akhilesh kii chhavi alag kism kii bani he
 Similar thinking was seen in the Muslim voters of Meerut in Muzaffarnagar and Saharanpur districts
 saharanpur kii saaton vidhaan sabha siton par muslim matadaata lagbhag 35 se 40 fisadi hai
 Behat, Deoband and Gangoh assembly seats of Saharanpur are Muslim majority
 yahaan muslim matadaataaon kii yahi soch dikhaai di ki bijepi ke khilaaf jo bhi sabase shashakt ummidavaar hoga, usee ko vot denge, wo chaahe kisi bhi party kaa kyon naa ho
 According to Tanjim ulema-e-hind state president Maulana nadeem-ul-wajidi, Akhilesh was forced to ally with the Congress because of his government's failures
 vaazidi kaa kahana he ki is gathbandhan kaa phayda samaajawaadee party ko jarur milegaa kyonki jin siton par congress kaa pratyaashee nahin he vahaan par congress kaa 7 fisadi fiks vot samaajawaadee party ke khate main jayega
 He also said that Muslims should vote for the same candidate who appears to be defeating the BJP
 devband main aam muslim matadaata bhi espi-congress gathbandhan ko pehali pasand bataate najar aae
 Equations in Eastern Uttar Pradesh Different Equations in Eastern Uttar Pradesh are slightly different
 yahaan bhi musalamaanon kii pehali chahat samaajawaadee party jarur he, lekin yahaan bispi ne is tabake main badi send bhi laga rakhi he
 If the Ansari brothers join Mayawati, then Muslims may lean towards the BSP
 kam se kam gajipur, mau jonpur, gorakhpur sareekhe ilaakon main musalmaan bispi kii taraf mud sakate hai
 The electoral equation in Mau seems to be changing as soon as Mukhtar Ansari's BSP ticket shows signs of contesting from Mau Sadar Legislative Assembly
 sadar ke muslim voter ab hathi par sawari karne kaa man bana rahe hai
 The trend of Lucknow and Awadh region in Lucknow and Awadh region is more likely that Muslims will join the Samajwadi Party and Congress
 lakhanu ke sunni musalamaanon ke dharm guru firangimahali yun to khulkar nahin bolte lekin akhilesh ke kaamkaaj kii tarif khulkar karte hai
 At the same time, leaders of Shia Muslims do not appear to be standing with Akhilesh at the moment
 is kshetra main bhi musalamaanon kii pehali pasand espi-congress gathbandhan ho saktaa he lekin jahaan bhi bispi ummidavaar zyada majboot dikhaa, muslim matadaata uski taraf mud sakate hai
 Different opinions in Varanasi: There was a different opinion about the attitude of Muslim voters in Varanasi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's parliamentary constituency
 muslim dharm guruon kii maane to dharm jati ke aadhaar par baantkar vot dekhnaa bilkul galat he
 But if we talk about the current situation, the trend of Muslims of Varanasi has increased towards BSP
 haalanki musalamaanon kaa ek tabaka espi-congress gathbandhan ko acha kadam bataa rahaa he
 Number of Muslims in Varanasi 15
 85 fisadi, azamgarh main 28
 07 percent, 22 in Mau
 74 fisadi, gajipur main 13
 89 percent and 10 in Mirzapur
 63 fisadi he
 The equation is not clear in Bundelkhand, if the Samajwadi Party is considered to be the weakest link in UP, then it is Bundelkhand
 lekin party yahaan apana trumpcard khilne ja rahi he
 The alliance with the Congress appears to benefit here
 saath hi akhilesh yahaan khud chunaav lard sakate hai
 But it is also true that BSP has been considered very strong in Bundelkhand
 aise main jin jagahon par bispi kaa majboot ummidavaar dikhegaa, vahaan musalmaan bispi par daanv lagaana pasand kar sakate hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has targeted Congress on Wednesday, breaking the silence on violence and violence with North Indians in Gujarat
 piem modi ne kaha ki congress kaa mantra 'baanto or raaj karo' he jabaki bijepi 'sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas' ke mantra ke saath kaam karti he
 Share the Congress policy and rule: Prime Minister Modi was addressing BJP booth workers of Raipur, Mysore, Dholpur, Damoh and Agra through the Namo app as part of bjp's 'mera Booth, Sampoorna' campaign
 isamen sambodhan main unhone kaha ki congress ne aaj tak baanto or raaj karo par amal kiya he
 By provoking people on small matters, they have done the job of straightening the owl
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ham sukh baantne vaale hai, wo samaaj baantne vaale hai
 We have to try to bring happiness in everyone's life by sharing happiness
 unka kaam samaaj ko baantkar khud ke parivaar kaa bhala karne kaa he
 PM Modi alleged that such events are being encouraged in view of the assembly elections to be held in 5 states
 unhone kaha ki congress kaa kaam hi he todo, baanto or ek duusare se ladaao
 Let me tell you that after the incident of rape with a 14-month-old girl in Gujarat, violence against North Indians erupted
 jiske baad upi or bihar ke logon kaa palaayan shuru ho gaya
 On this issue, posters of 'gujarati Narendra Modi Benares Quit' were also installed in Prime Minister Modi's parliamentary constituency Varanasi
 3 new States were formed in a harmonious manner during Atal Ji’s tenure

 com / vmqkx0xefw— BJP (@ bjp4india) October 10, 2018 The Grand Alliance wants a forced government for profit PM Modi addressed the BSP supremo Maayavatika without name while addressing the workers
 piem ne kaaryakartaaon se kaha, 'pichley dinon gathbandhan kii ek netaa kaa bayaan aapane suna hoga
 He even said that a strong, not forced government is needed at the Center
 aap samaj sakate hai ki aakhir ye majaboor sarkaar kii kyon apeksha rakhte hai
 'let me tell you that BSP supremo Mayawati had said in a statement in July,' This political voice of bsp's father and founder, Kanshi Ram, is right today that in the present situation there is a need for a strong, not forced government
 matlab centre main aisi hi gathbandhan kii sarkaar honi chahie taaki us par deshhit main kaam karne kii talwaar lataki rahe or sarkaar taanaashaahee kaa vaisaa vyavhaar nahin kar sake jaisaa aajkal bijepi ke kaal main dikh rahaa he
 On the grand alliance against the BJP, PM Modi told the workers, "leave the worry of the alliance
 ye majaburi se ikatthe hue log hai, jo jamaanat par hai
 Those people are looking for a way to protect themselves
 ye janata kii bhalaai ke liye ikatthe nahin hue hai, inkaa ek hi makasad he modi hataao
 While giving the mantra of 'my booth, the strongest' to the booth workers, the PM said that winning the election is not an ego to defeat anyone, it is an opportunity for us to do this service
 vishwa hindu parishad (viechpi) kii ore se ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan kii khatir chah maheene pehle deshbhar se pathar ikattha karne kaa rashtravyapee abhiyaan shuru kiya gaya tha
 Under this, two trucks loaded with stones have entered the city on Sunday
 is puri kavayad ke bich jila police satark ho gai he or halaat par najar rakh rahi he
 VHP spokesperson Sharad Sharma said, 'stones have been taken off from two trucks at Ram Sevak Puram, the property of VHP in Ayodhya and' Shila Pujan 'has been done by Mahant Nritya Das, president of Ram Janma Bhumi
 ' mahant nrity gopal das ne bataaya ki modi sarkaar se sanket mili hai ki ab mandir kaa nirmaan karavaaya jayega
 He will continue to deliver the stones, he said, 'the time has come to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya
 ammyodhyaamein dher saare pathar pahunch gaye hai
 Now the stones will continue to reach
 hamen modi sarkaar se sanket mili hai ki mandir kaa nirmaan ab kiya jayega
 Reacting to the arrival of stones at VHP headquarters, Faizabad Senior Superintendent of Police Mohit Gupta said that the police is monitoring the situation
 nijee parisar main rakhe gaye patharvarisht police adheekshak ne kaha, 'ham halaat par paini nigaah rakh rahe hai
 The stones have been brought and placed in a private compound
 is vaakye se yadi shanti bhang hoti he yaa sampradayik sadbhaav bigadataa he to ham nishchit taur par karrwai karenge
 VHP announced in June that it would collect stones from across the country for the construction of the temple, reiterating its pledge to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya
 singhl ne di thi jaankariviechapi ne muslim samudaay ko bhi chetavanee di thi ki vah ram mandir nirmaan main koi adnga na lagaae
 VHP leader Ashok Singhal had said a few days before his death that around 2 to build the Ram temple

 25 lakh cubic foot stones are ready at the VHP headquarters in Ayodhya
 shesh ek lakh cubic foot pathar desh bhar se hindu shraddhaluon se ikattha kiye jaaenge
 "the administration had said, stones will not come", however, the administration reacted immediately, saying that it would oppose the move, as the matter is sub judice
 uttar pradesh ke grih vibhaag ke pramukh sachiv devashish pandas ne kaha tha ki rajya sarkaar ram mandir ke liye ayodhya main pathar nahin aane degi
 He had said, 'since the matter is sub judice, the government will not allow any new tradition to be started in relation to the Ayodhya issue

 The child learns a lot in school along with other children, but it is difficult to teach him at home
 aamtaur par maa-baap ko pataa hi nahin hota ki bachche ko padhaane kaa sahi tarika kya he
 They think that scolding or killing the child is an option so that they start studying fearfully
 lekin sawaal he ki kya vaaki yah sahi tarika he
 No, not at all! By scaring the child, you can force him to read in front of you, but he will avoid studying as a burden as soon as you lose sight
 aise main maa-baap ke liye yah jaananaa bahut jaruri he ki bachche ko kis tarah padhaaen taaki vah padhai ko enjoy kareor padhai main uski ruchi bade
 Before teaching children, know that you need patience in this work
 baccha aapse ek hi sawaal kai baar karegaa or aapako use samajhaana padegaa
 Apart from this, while teaching the child, take special care of these things: 1
 agar baccha bahut chota he to use photo vaali kitaab, kavitaaon vaali kitaab yaa phir kavitaaon vaale video kii madad se sikhaane kii koshish karen
 2
 chote bacchon ko padhaane ke liye kai tarah ke khilone aate hai
 Using them will also be very beneficial
 aapkaa baccha khel-khel main kaaphi kuch sikh jayega
 3
 bacchon ke saath jaankaree se bhari baaten karen
 Try to answer their questions logically
 sunakar koi bhi cheez zyada jaldi samaj aati he
 4
 bachche ko ghar main baandhakar mat rakhen
 Children learn a lot by looking at things in society and meeting other children
 5
 Do not consider strictness with children the only option
 bacchon ko alag-alag tareeke se samajhane kii koshish karen
 They can insist but once their fear of beating or scolding is gone, they will also stop respecting you

 But you can't ask me to do this

 ) kya himalay parvat shrinkhalaa apana rukh badal rahaa he? kya himalay se sate rajya himalay main ho rahe badlaav ko mahasoos karne lage hai? nepal main aae bheeshan bukamp ke baad himalay main ho rahi halchal kashmir tak mahasoos ho rahi he
 The weather in the Himalayas is also changing after the earthquake in Nepal and North India
 himaskhalan bhi badhane lage hai
 The region of Kargil and Ladakh in Jammu and Kashmir is adjacent to the Himalayas and this area has been isolated from the country for the last 5 months
 vaise bhi ye ilaaka har saal 4 maheene sadak sampark se kataa rahata he lekin is saal kargil or ladakh ke logon ko sadak se judane ke liye kuch zyada hi intjaar karnaa hoga
 In fact, the only road connecting the Ladakh region with the country and the world, the srinagar-kargil highway has not been able to get traffic due to the icy storms that have been coming in the last few days
 amuman agar mausam saath de to ye rajmarg may ke maheene main khul jaataa he
 Usually, this highway, which opens every year in the month of April, can open in May if the weather supports it
 himalay kii pahadiyon se hote hue is rajmarg ko ladakh or kargil main rahane vaale logon ke saath saath china or pakistani simaaon par tainaat javaanon ke liye jivan rekha mana jaataa he
 This year, the Himalayas received less snowfall in winter, but after the winter season, the snowfall is becoming the biggest problem to open this highway
 ilaake ke logon kii jivan rekha kahi jane vaali sadak ke khulne main ho rahi deree kii vajah se logon ko paidal yatra kerani pad rahi he jo kaaphi khatarnaak he
 People living in Kargil and Dras now have no choice but to walk on this road and people are also reaching Srinagar on foot
 gauratlab he ki november ke maheene main ye sadak yatayaat ke liye band kar diya jaati he
 In the month of March, the road is re-qualified for traffic
 rajyasabha main naagarikta vidheyak paas karaane kii chunautiaaj rajyasabha main pesh hoga citijanship amendament bilsomvaar ko loksabhaa main naagarik sanshodhan bill aasaani se paas ho chukaa he
 Now this bill will be introduced in Rajya Sabha today
 rajyasabha kii kaarywahi kii suchi ke mutabik dopaher 2 baje is bill par charchaa shuru hogi
 a time of 6 hours has been fixed for discussion on this bill in Rajya Sabha
 modi sarkaar kii asal pariksha tab hogi jab charchaa ke baad bill rajyasabha main paarit kiya ja rahaa hoga
 There is full potential of uproar in Rajya Sabha during this period as BJP as well as Congress, TMC and SP have also issued three line whips to their mps to be present in Rajya Sabha
 gauratlab he ki naagarik sanshodhan bill ke paksh main jediu, shivasena, bijedy or purvottar ke kuch dalon ke saath aane kii vajah se loksabhaa main to sarkaar ko is bill ko paas karaane main koi dikkat nahin hui
 But Shiv Sena chief and Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has increased the government's trouble by placing a condition to support in Rajya Sabha
 lekin agar rajyasabha kaa dalgat aankada dekhen to modi sarkaar ise yahaan bhi aasaani se paas kara sakati he
 There are 245 total members in the Rajya Sabha required for 121 votes
 lekin philhal paanch siten rikt hai
 Due to this, the total number of members in Rajya Sabha is 240
 iskaa matlab yah he ki bill ke liye agar sadan ke sabhi sadsy matdaan karen to bahumat ke liye 121 voton kii jarurat padegi
 The BJP has 127 votes in order to pass the Citizens Amendment Bill in the Rajya Sabha
 More number of mps can vote in their favor than the number of mps the Modi government needs
 aapako bataa den ki rajyasabha main bijepi ke 83, jediu ke 6, ediemke ke 11, bijedy ke 7, esaidi ke 3, arpiai ke 1, algepi ke 1, wiesar congress ke 2, tidipi ke 2, agypi ke 1, bipief ke 1, enpief ke 1, esadf ke 1, nominated 3 sadsy, nirdaleey evam anya 4 sadasyon ke saath kul 127 saansad hai jo bill ke paksh main vot kar sakate hai
 But two mps from the government side may also be absent due to health reasons
 vipaksh ke paas hai sirf 113 votevahin jo dal is bill kaa virodh kar rahe hai rajyasabha main unki kul sankhya sirf 113 hi he
 In opposition to the bill, 46 of Congress, 13 of TMC, 4 of NCP, 9 of SP, 3 of AAP, 4 of BSP, 1 of CPI, 5 of CPM, 5 of DMK, 1 of IUML, 2 of PDP, 2 of JDS
 There are 113 mps with 1, Kerala Congress MK 1, MDMK 1, PMK 1, RJD 4, Shiv Sena 3, TRS 6, 1 nominated member and 2 independents and others
 ummid kii ja rahi he ki vipaksh ke sabhi sadsy kal rajyasabha main upasthit rah sakate hai
 Because of this, the Shiv Sena changed the decision
 Congress sources told Aaj Tak that the party's top leadership was upset with the Shiv Sena voting in favor of the bill in the Lok Sabha
 or isse judaa spasht sandesh maharashtra main haal hi bane gathbandhan tak pahunchaa diya gaya tha
 For this reason, Shiv Sena changed its stand on the bill within 24 hours

 After receiving the information, a team of doctors conducted investigations at the Primary and Community Health Center and the report was submitted to the World Health Organization (WHO)
 angreji akhbaar 'da times of india' main chhapi khabar ke mutabik WHO ne upi ke baheri, mirganj, faridpur or nawabganj tehsil se kareeb 208 stool sample mumbai bheje hai
 An investigation report is awaited
 vahiin duusari taraf sthaneey prashasan ne bhi qamar kas lee he
 Special teams have been deployed to monitor this
 chif medical officer vijay yadav ne kaha, 'haath-pair main kamajori kaa keval ye matlab nahin ki baccha polio kaa shikaar he
 Until the complete investigation report of the stool sample comes, it cannot be called polio
 ' unhone kaha, 'abhi tak 170 sample ke report mili hai jinamein polio kii baat sabit nahin hui he

 With the flute, Lord Krishna, Vrindavan, Gopis and Rasleela begin to feel themselves, but now in the twenty-first century, this world's oldest and natural musical instrument is also becoming 'hi-tech'
 bansuri yaa banshi ko vishwa main sabase pracheenatam or prakritik vaadya yantra mana jaataa he or iske taar puranic kathaon se jude hue hai
 Taking care of this legacy, it has now been arranged using technology that the harmonic notes of the flute can now be enjoyed by the listeners sitting in state-of-the-art auditoriums in the same way that the gopis in the liturgy used to listen to it
 prasiddh bansuri vadak pandit ronu majumdaar ne khaas baatcheet main kaha, ‘main germany se ek mixr lekar aayaa hum, jiske prayog se bansuri main pratidhwani (iko), anugunj or lokastyle ke ras kaa lutf uthaaya ja saktaa he or iske prayog se aawaaj ko niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 When asked about the change in the sound of the flute, he said, "the basic tone of an instrument should not be affected by the use of technique, but it should be helpful in making the listener feel the original sound
" ’unhone kaha, ‘is mixr ko sidhe bansuri se nahin joda jaataa balki ise microphone se joda jaataa he
 The use of this will not bring syntheticness (texture) to the sound of the flute and will not eliminate its real scent, rather the listener will experience its varied forms in the auditorium
 ’bansuri ke bare main prasiddh sangitajna pandit hariprasad chaurasia ne kaha, ‘bansuri na keval duniya kaa sabase pracheenatam vaadyayantra he balki yah ekmaatr aisa vaadya yantra he, jo vishwa ke har kone main bajaayaa jaataa he
 'it is noteworthy that Pandit Pannalal Ghosh identified the flute as a classical instrument and Pandit Hari Prasad Chaurasia enriched it by using Alap, Jod, Jhala, and Dhrupad
 bakaul majumdaar, ‘pandit pannalaal ghosh ne devaki kii tarah bansuri ko janm diya or pandit hariprasad chaurasia ne yashoda kii tarah use paala posa
 'among those who enrich the flute are Pandit Raghunath Seth, Pandit Vijay Raghav Rao and Pandit Devendra Gurudeshwar
 isamen pandit hariprasad chaurasia kaa yogadan athulaneey he
 Significantly, Ronu Majumdar has invented a conch flute and for this he brought a piece of bamboo about three and a half feet long from Assam
 unka kahana he ki bans kii bansuri kii apni shastreey pahchaan he or iske suron kii mithaas ko koi nahin chura saktaa
 Majumdar said that changes should be made very seriously in any instrument so that changes do not come in the original form
 unhone udhaaharan die ki jaise shehanai main metal horn lagane se uske mul swaroop main fark aa jaataa he
 According to experts, it is believed that the flute came into existence long before Krishna
 jangalon main bans ke jhuramuton main kide-makode suraag bana dete the or jab hawa usamen se guzarati thi to mithi swar lahari puure maahaul main tairne lagati thi
 It is believed that here humans have taken inspiration from the eternal and natural instrument flute
