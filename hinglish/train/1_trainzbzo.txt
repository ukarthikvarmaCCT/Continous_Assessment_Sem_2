 England defeated Team India by 31 runs in the ICC Cricket World Cup match played in Birmingham on Sunday
 is haar ke baad team india kii ballebaaji par sawaal uth rahe hai
 Especially on the batting of Kedar Jadhav and Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 kul milakar madhyakram ke ballebaajon ke liye ab tak yah toornament acha nahin rahaa he, jisase unhone khud par dabaav bana liya he
 In this match, when India needed to increase their run speed, both these batsmen looked helpless
 45wein over main mahendra singh dhoni kaa saath nibhaane kedaar jadhav utre
 At that time, India had to score 71 runs in 31 balls
 lekin donon kii saajhedaari ek baar phir bharat ke kaam nahin ai
 It never even felt that these two were playing for victory
 dhoni (naabad 42) ne 31 gendon par 4 chauke or ek chakka lagaaya
 Interestingly, chasing a mountain goal from Team India, the same six came out and that too in the last over
 duusari taraf kedaar jadhav ne 13 gendon par naabad 12 ranon main ek chaukaa lagaaya
 Dhoni and Kedar Jadhav's flop partnership 31 ball 39 run 7 dot ball 20 single 3 fours 1 Seeing the two batsmen batting against Chhakaingland, former India captain and commentator Sourav Ganguly said, 'you have 5 wickets, yet you don't try to win, all these Mind set states
 ' afghanistan ke khilaaf match main bhi dhoni or jadhav kii ballebaaji kii khub aalochana hui thi
 Sachin Tendulkar had questioned Dhoni's batting
 afghanistan ke viruddh match main dhoni ore jadhav paanchaven wicket ke liye 84 gendon main 57 ran hi jod paae the
 Team India, who came out to bat first in that match, was stopped by Afghanistan's spinners for 224 / 8 runs
 haalanki afgaan team lakshya se dur rah gai or 49
 213 runs were piled up in 5 overs
 mahendra singh dhoni kii sabase badi kamajori jo ab tak saamne ai he, vah he strike ko kam rotate karnaa or dot ball adhik khelnaa
 Due to this weakness of Dhoni, India's innings slows down
 semifinal or final jaise muqablon main dhoni kii isi kamajori ke kaaran agar bharat bada score nahin bana paaegaa to team ko bada khamiyaja bhugatna pad saktaa he
 Earlier, former Indian batsman VVS Laxman has commented on Dhoni's batting
 vivies lakshmana ne kaha ki dhoni ko apni is approach par kaam karnaa hoga
 Laxman said, "dhoni's strike rate at the beginning of the innings was between 45-50
 isse team par or unke saath ballebaaji kar rahe khilaadi par pressure banataa he
 ' mumbai or saurashtra ke bich 26 se 30 janvari ke bich hone vaala ranjai trophy final vankhede stadium main khelaa jayega
 The BCCI said on Monday, 'mumbai will play the final of the 2012-13 Ranji Trophy against Saurashtra at Wankhede Stadium Mumbai
 ' is match ke liye ke hariharan or o nandan ko maidani ampire niyukt kiya gaya he
 Virender Sharma will be the third umpire and Colonel Chinmay Sharma the match referee
 is match kaa sidhaa prasaaran kiya jayega
 Former England captain Michael Vaughan says that although there is no shortage of Sachin Tendulkar's batting, if the short-pitched balls are used against Sachin in the beginning of the india-england Test series, then the master blaster can be stopped
 
 maaikel won kaa kahana he ki 2007 main england ke 6 fit 7 inch ke tej gendbaaz kris tremelet ne sachin ke khilaaf acha pradarshan kiya tha
 According to Vaughan, Tremlett has become better than ever and in such a situation Tremlett will definitely test Sachin with his short pitch balls
 jammu-kashmir or ladakh ke uparajyapal satyapal malik ne kaha he ki rajya main 50,000 bhartiyon kaa pataa lagaaya gaya he
 These posts will be recruited by campaigning within two to three months
 unhone yah nahin bataaya ki 50,000 padon main se zyaadaatar kis prakaar ke pad hai, chaturth shrenee ke hai yaa madhya shrenee ke hai
 Talking of completing the recruitment drive within two to three months
 bharat ke haal-philhal ke itihaas main kahin bhi do se teen maheene ke bheetar 50,000 bhartiyon kii prakriya puri hui hogi
 But if you want to speak on TV, why keep it short
 hedline bhi to banegi ki teen maheene main hongi 50,000 bhartiyon
 For any state to have such priority of recruitment in government jobs, it should be welcomed
 kashmir ko lekar hue is faisale se un rajyon ke yuva bhi utsahit or chakit hai jinke liye kashmir kaa faisalaa kiya gaya he
 bihar-bengal to rajasthan-madhya Pradesh and the largest states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Delhi are also included
 kashmir kii aabaadi sava karod he tab vahaan par maatr 50,000 pad hi khaali mili hai
 Uttar Pradesh has a population of over 20 crores
 kya aisa ho saktaa he ki upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath bhi saare vibhaagon ke khaali padon kii sankhya kaa pataa lagaaein or kashmir par aadhi adhuri jaankaree ko sar-maathe par liye naujavaanon ko bataa den
 Give the target that three months is not right, after completing the recruitment in six months, we will give the appointment
 uttar pradesh sarkaar do saal main 1 lakh 37 hazaar shikshakon kii niyukti puri nahin kar pai
 The Supreme Court quashed the adjustment of Shikshamitras and said that instead of them, new teachers should be recruited as primary education is very important for children
 68,500 kii bhartee nikali usamen se bhi saare pad nahin bhare gaye
 Then on 6 January 69000 teachers were tested
 maamla court main chalaa gaya he
 The date is increasing there
 saat maheene ho gaye riselt nahin niklaa he
 The same is true of other examinations, which do not have to be written separately
 hindi main likh rahaa hum taaki sabhi rajyon ke alag-alag pariksha ke chaatr is samasya main hi apni samasya shaamil maan len
 Why there is no restlessness in the government recruitment of other states like Kashmir
 centre sarkaar kii staff salection kamishan kii pariksha ko lekar bechaini kyon nahin he
 The CGL 2017 exam has not been completed yet
 railway ke group di kii pariksha main maatr photo ke liye lakhon chaatro ko pariksha se vanchit kar diya gaya
 500 rupees were also taken from him which was not returned
 chunaav ke samay jo bahaali nikali thi usamen bhi 500 rupee liye gaye the tab rail mantri goyal ne kaha tha ki 400 waapas hoga
 Some people got it and others forgot it
 rahul gandhi ne ek saal ke bheetar centre sarkaar ke khaali padon ko bharne kaa vaada kiya tha, naujavaanon ne unke vaade par bharosa nahin kiya
 The BJP, which mocked his every thing, went over the edge
 use pataa tha ki is baat kaa mazaaq udaayenge to apana hi pardaafaash ho jayega or nayaa vaada karnaa padegaa
 Well now Rahul Gandhi has also forgotten this issue
 kam se kam rajasthan or madhya pradesh kii parikshaon kii hi report le lete, vahaan ek saal ke bheetar bhartiyon puri kara dete to yuvaaon ke paas jane kaa mauqaa hota
 In Madhya Pradesh too, the result of teacher resumption has been waiting for seven months
 yah bhi sahi he ki jab chunaav aata he tab yahi noujvaan apane is mudde ko praathamikta nahin dete hai
 Their information on Kashmir is the same which the leaders have put under propaganda
 use hi antim maanakar gum rahe hai
 Leaders have increased confidence that if something happens, Kashmir will definitely get votes
 ab agar vot bank ke liye nahin kiya he to phir baaki rajyon ke naujavaanon ko bhi naukariyaan samay se do
 Youngsters can also ask this question that in other states too, they can run a campaign to recruit government posts
 sirf kashmir hi kyon? kashmir ke propeganda ko saport karne vaale naujavaanon ko bhi to kuch mili
 Politicians are confident that even after giving jobs, Kashmir has given them a job of debate
 yah bharosa rajyapal ko bhi he
 Therefore, they are openly saying that public shoes will hit the supporter of Article 370 in the elections
 public ko bheed main badalakar hamalaa karne kaa prashikshan puraa ho chukaa he
 You must have seen that when the accused of killing Inspector Subodh Singh came out of jail, they were welcomed with flower garlands
 ab bheed banakar hatya karne vaali public ke bharose elaan kiya ja rahaa he ki vah juute bhi maar sakati he
 Hopefully, this public will be announced with the same grace
 taaki noujvaan naukari paakar pehle juute to kareed len
 Then the shoes will keep hitting
 aisa lagata he ki janata sarkaar kii lathait ho gai he, jab vah kahegi do chaar logon ko juute maarane chal degi
 Be proud be proud aap kisi ko bhi juute maarane laayak hue hai

 co / awg4s9w2xr bharat kii tarah srilanka ko bhi spinneron ke liye swarg mana jaataa he lekin twanti 20 vishwa championships se pehle abhyaas maichon ko dekhakar lagata he ki is toornament main spinneron kii tulana main tej gendbaajon kii adhik tuuti bol sakati he
 Consider the ten practice matches played between September 13 to 17 between the different teams participating in the tournament, except for a few matches, most of them dominated by fast or medium bowlers
 in maichon main tej gendbaajon ne 75 to spinneron ne 35 wicket liye
 Most teams, including India, showed greater confidence in the fast bowlers rather than their spinners
 bharat ne apane donon abhyaas maichon main teen tej gendbaajon or do spinneron kaa upyog kiya
 In the match against Sri Lanka, fast bowler Irfan Pathan took five wickets and Laxmipathy Balaji took three wickets but it was not effective against Pakistan in which off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin took four wickets
 australia kaa spin vibhaag main puraa daaromadar leg spinner bread haag par tikaa he
 He has not disappointed the team by performing well so far but Australia have kept four fast bowlers in their attack
 yahi sthiti dakshin africa kii he jisane robin petersan ke rup main ekmaatr spinner rakhaa he
 Dale Steyn played a key role in South Africa's win over New Zealand
 unhone is match main 25 ran dekar chaar wicket liye
 He was well supported by Albie Morkel and Lonwabo Tsotsobe
 mejabaan srilanka ke spin vibhaag kii jimmedaari rangana herath par he lekin captain mahela jayavardhane ne abhyaas maichon main sanket diye ki vah apane tej gendbaaj lasith maalinga, nuwan kulshekhara, shaminda iranga or tisara perera par hi adhik bharosa dikhaaenge
 The West Indies certainly expect a charismatic performance from Sunil Narine but six of the eight wickets his bowlers took in practice matches went to the fast bowlers' account
 fidel edwards, ravi rampal or captain derren saimi uski tej gendbaaji trimurti hai jinke har match main khilne kii sambhaavna he
 Pakistan have useful spinners in the form of Saeed Ajmal, Shahid Afridi and Mohammad Hafeez who can be successful here but Umar Gul is still the match-winning bowler of the team
 ireland or zimbabwe ke bich abhyaas match main irish spinner alex kusa ne teen over main chah ran dekar teen wicket liye or apni team kii jeet main ahm bhoomika nibhaai lekin yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki is match main jo 13 wicket gire unamem das wicket tej or madhyam gati ke gendbaajon ne liye
 'innocent had neither love nor jealousy with Goraiya
 goraiya khidki par aa baithe yaa chat main ghosla banaae isamen use kya aapatti ho sakati he? phir bhi vah vichlit ho gai

 yah unke upanyaas 'aadhi stri' kii chand panktiyaan hai
 We are talking about 84 year old Abid Surti
 5 may, 1935 ko gujarat ke amarelli jile ke rajula main paidaa hue aabid ko kisi parichay vishesh kii darkaar nahin
 He has become a moving legend in himself
 unhen desh ke pehle super hero comic banane ke chalate 'fadar of indian comics' kaha jaataa he
 But this is only part of his vivid, diverse life introduction
 vah ek bade chitrakaar, khyaati praapt lekhak, mahaan cartoonist, umdaa patrkaar, janemaane paryaavaranvid, yashasvi naatakkaar, safal patakatha lekhak or aise samajasevi hai, jinaki koshish pani bachaakar dharti par jivan bachaane kii he
 With his cartoon character named 'dhabbu Ji', Abid Surti maintained his brilliant presence in the cartoon world of the country and the world for more than three decades
 unke banaae cartoon bharat kii sabhi pramukh patrikaon or patron main prakashit hote rahe hai
 Comic character 'bahadur' is his birth
 unke prashansakon main desh ke karodon logon ke alaava osho, atal bihari vaajapeyi, aashaa bhonsle, amitabh bachchan, shahrukh khan jaisi hastiyaan shaamil hai
 He has a wealth of books written in Hindi, English, Gujarati
 kehete hai film 'atithi tum kab jaaoge' kii kahani bhi unki ek kahani se prerit thi
 Dharmveer Bharti once wrote for his book 'kali Kitab', 'the old sacred books of the world were written in a time of history when certain values were required to be set in order to organize and organize human society
 par aabid surati kii yah mahatvapurn 'kaali kitaab' itihaas ke aise daur main likhi gai he, jab sthapit mulya-maryaadaayen juthi padane lagi hai or nae sire se ek vidrohi chintan kii aavashyaktaa he, taaki jo maryaadaaon kaa chhadam- samaaj ko or vyakti kii antaratma ko andar se vighatit kar rahaa he, uske punargathan kaa aadhaar khoja ja sake
 The Tandava dance of Mahakal is ruthless, demolishes a lot, so as to form the basis of new human creation
 vahi nirmamata is kriti ke vyangy main bhi he
 'abid Surti is such a rare narrator and artist, his creations attack the roots, stereotypes and traditions that have been going on for centuries, so the engraved brushes and colors in his painting take him far beyond the art of this world and ultimately humanity
 Let's draw a blueprint for betterment
 
 
 par aabid hai ki shabdon or rangon se hi unka man nahin bharta
 
 
 
 vah mumbai jaise mahanagar main pani bachaane kii muhim kaa ek janaa-pahachaanaa cheharaa hai
 The funny thing is that this campaign started with such a small experience in his life, usually which we all ignore in our lives
 hua yah ki saal 2007 main aabid surati apane ek dost ke ghar baithe the, jab unki najar achaanak dost ke ghar main ek li karte pani ke tap par padi
 When he drew his friend's attention to this, he did not pay any special attention to this matter
 aabid dukhi ho gaye, isi bich unhone ek artical padhaa, jisase pataa chalaa ki agar pani kii ek boond har second barbaad hoti he, to har maheene kareeb ek hajaar litre pani barbaad ho jaataa he
 It was here that a campaign to save water started in his mind
 
 
 
 With this, Sir J

 Educated at the School of Art and winning the National Film Award for Writing, Abhid, who was awarded the Gujarat Gaurav Samman, set out on his own shoulder to save water
 vah saal 2007 se 'da drops ded foundation' abhiyaan chalaakar logon ke gharon main nal se tapakati pani kii buundon ko bachaa rahe hai
 According to a report, so far, they have saved about six million liters of water from waste on their own
 aabid surati kii pramukh kritiyon main kahani sangrah- teesri aankh, aatankit, duusari bivi, das pratinidhi kahaniyaan; upanyaas- kathavachak, musalmaan, kaali kitaab, aadmi or chuuhe, bahattar saal kaa baccha, khoyaa hua cheharaa, kaale gulab, gulmohar ke aansu; naatak- nari pariksha, radhe-radhe ham sab aadhe; bal sahitya- nawab rangile, dow
 Includes Miracles of Tinchu, Why Buddha Smiled, After 2500 Years and many other books
 sahitya ajtak ne is anuthi shakhsiyat ko unke janmdin par badhai dete hue lambii baatcheet kii
 Excerpts: 1
 sabase pehle janmdin kii shubhakamanaayen
 Where do you bring so much energy even at this age? - i get my energy from positive thinking, support of younger generation and - with respect and love for nature
 2
 What is the renewable source of your creativity? How are the Abids present today? Your process of creation, from childhood till now? - Open Window of the Mind, Open Mind
 isse jivan main har pag ke saath main kuch sikhta hum
 An example, which i read in an Osho book - we think of ourselves as intellectual, liberal, no matter what, but when we get married, have children, what do we do - we do our religion Or impose it on children, or wait for them to choose their religion according to their choice when they are mature? In short, i did not impose religion
 kyon? isliye ki maine osho ke vichaaron ko apanaaya or apane dimag ko hameshaa taazgi, taaje vichaaron ke liye khulaa rakhaa

 1965 ke 'tootela farista' se 'the Black Book', ‘musalman’ or 'teesri aankh' sahit 80 se bhi adhik kitabon ke is safar main aapaki sabase behatar kriti or kirdaar koun he or kyon?- 'sufi' ( musalmaan ), 'kaali kitaab', 'bahattar saal kaa baccha' 
 
 
 
 koi ek nahin, inamen se kai
 Talking about Kali Kitab, its content, especially the character of Satan, was unique
 kamaleshwar or dow dharmaveer bharti, donon ko hi yah behad pasand aayaa
 First Kamleshwar published it in Sarika
 jab yah pustak ke rup main chapa, to ek ne iske flap kaa matter likhaa, to duusare ne isaki bhoomika likhi
 It was a matter of pride for a newcomer like me, what could have been a blistering entry into the field of Hindi literature
 'sufi' ke jeevant charitra ikbaal ne to pathakon kii najar main kabhi na bhuulane vaali image banaai
 Similarly, 'seventy-two-year-old child' novel which was written keeping children in mind, parents also liked it very much
 is pustak main mukhya nayak apni eemaandaaree, vishwasaneeyata or saahas ke chalate pathakon ke dilodimag par pehle panne se hi chaa jaataa he

 kahani, aatmakatha, upanyaas, naatak, kavita, patakatha lekhan
 
 
 Have you written in all these genres? But in which genre do you find yourself comfortable? - Basically, i am a painter
 lekhan or cartoon aadi se main apni kala ke liye sahyog hasil karata tha
 So there was no commitment from them
 lekin jab main aarthik rup se vyavasthit ho gaya, tab main har us cheez ke liye gambhir ho gaya, jo main kar rahaa tha, khaskar sahitya se sambandhit - aap mujhe ek patibaddh lekhak kah sakate hai

 The world knows Abid Surti as a great reputed painter, cartoonist, writer, activist, strong voice of theater, but what is Abid basically? What do they like to be? - i am who i am, i am happy
 jab bhi, jo bhi karne kaa man karata he, karata hum
 6
 aapaki srujanshiltaa par kinakaa, or kinakin logon kaa prabhaav he?- college main maine sharad babu kii kitaab padhi to laga ki mujhe koi chunauti de rahaa he
 The question arose within - if he can write, then why can't I? And the cycle started
 7
 How do you see the present India and the world as an artist, creator? - i am a devotee of Buddha
 unka vichaar he- sab kuch parivartansheel he
 When Rama goes, Ravan will come and if Ravan goes, Rama will come
 ye daur ravan kaa chal rahaa he
 Ravana has come into power not only in India but also abroad
 kya kisi ne khwab main bhi sochaa tha ki vivekanand or gandhi ke desh par do kattar apradhi raaj karenge?8
 Your thoughts on the impact of technology in the field of creation? —technique is the greatest blessing for the present generation
 yah ek tarah se sarjan ke chaaku kii tarah he
 You can use it to give new life to your patient and can also stab the throat of an innocent person with the same knife
 9
 Your reaction to the camp in the fields of society, politics, art, literature and creation? - Camping is not a new phenomenon
 yah hajaaron saalon se hamaare jivan kaa hissaa he! aap ise apanaaie yaa chhod dijie, or khud ko jinda rakhane kaa rasta khojie
 10
 nai peedi ke liye koi sandesh? aabid kisi duniya kaa swapn dekhte hai?- nai peedi ko yah baat hameshaa yaad rakhni chahie - ve jivan se kya chaahate hai - khushi yaa samruddhi? ham prachur anand ke saath paidaa hue hai lekin agar ham dhan kii prapti ke liye bhaagambhag karne kaa faisla karte hai, to anand kaa str dhire-dhire neeche kii ore, shunya kii taraf aana shuru ho jayega
 Choose your career wisely, the one who gives you complete satisfaction, does not make you rich
 agar aap prasann ho, paisa khud-ba-khud aapkaa peechha karne lagegaa
 BJP Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi has given strong advice to the party leaders who are making controversial statements today
 modi ne twit karke kaha he ki khud ko bijepi kaa shubhachintak bataane vaale kuch log apane bayanon se vikaas or sushasan ke mudde par chal rahe prachaar abhiyaan ko bhatka rahe hai
 i reject any such irresponsible statement and appeal to such rhetoric to refrain from making such statements
 gauratlab he ki ek angreji dainik main chhapi khabar ke anusaar, togadiya ne shanivaar ko gujarat ke bhavnagar main ek raily main kathith rup se kaha tha ki musalamaanon ko hindu ilaakon main sampatti kharidne se roka janaa chahie
 At the same time, BJP leader Giriraj Singh in Bihar said at an election rally in Godda, Jharkhand that those who oppose his party's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi will have to leave India and go to Pakistan after the announcement of general election results
 
 giriraaj singh ne kaha tha ki jo log narendra modi ko rokna (piem banane se) chaahate hai, ve pakistan kii ore dekh rahe hai
 In the coming days, there will be no place for them in India, there will be a place for them in Pakistan
 salmaan khan kii apakaming film res 3 kaa trailor internet par dhooma machaa rahaa he
 The trailer of the film, which is going to release on June 15, is trending at number one on youtube
 ise ab tak 1 karod 2 lakh se zyada baar utyub par dekha ja chukaa he
 An interesting news about the film is that Salman will be seen telling a kind of girl in a scene in it
 apni film tubalite kii asafalataa par pehali baar bole salamanfilm ke trailor main ek seen he jisamen salmaan jacleen se unka haath maangate hai or jab jacleen aisa nahin karatin to vah kehete hai ki ghabaraao mat shaadi ke liye nahin maang rahaa hum
 This scene seen in the trailer of the film has already won the hearts of the audience
 yaad ho ki film kik main jacleen or salmaan kii jodi khaasi kaamyaab rahi thi
 This is the second film of the pair together
 salmaan kii res 3 kaa ek or ection packed trailor, dekhen khatarnaak stantjacleen furnandis ne haal hi main trailor launch ke dauraan salmaan kii tarif karte hue kaha tha ki vah aaj jo kuch bhi hai sirf salmaan kii vajah se hai

 To add to the troubles of the government, which is struggling to get a majority to pass the Lokpal Bill in the Rajya Sabha, the Trinamool Congress, a constituent of the UPA, said that it would introduce amendments to remove the provision to appoint Lokayukta in the states from this bill
 rajyasabha main chah sadasyon vaali trinmul congress ne ucch sadan main is vidheyak par charchaa shuru hone se pehle spasht kiya ki vah lokayukta vaale praavdhaan kaa puri takat se virodh karegi
 The leader of this party and Minister of State for Shipping, Mukul Rai said, "we have already introduced amendments in this regard and will put pressure on it
" ’’ loksabhaa main do din pehle paarit is vidheyak main rajya sarkaron kii razaamandi se lokayukta sthapit karne kii vyavastha he
 Asked whether Trinamool members would vote against the bill, he said, "no such question arises at the moment"
 raay ne kaha ki vidheyak par charchaa puri ho jane ke baad matdaan kaa sawaal uthegaa
 But so far, the Trinamool Lokayukta is firm on its opinion of removing Part-3 of the bill
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ham keval lokayukta praavdhaan hataane kaa dabaav bana rahe hai
 We have no problem with the Lokpal part
 ham rajyon main lokayukta banaae jane ke paksh main hai, lekin aisa rajya swayan karenge, na na ki kendra kii ore se aisa hoga
 The Trinamool leader said that party leaders have spoken to Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee to resolve the issue
 unke sabase najdiki log bhi is baat kii tasdik karenge ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ke dimag ko padhuya aasaan nahin hota
 This was once again proved by his cabinet reshuffle last week
 bhaajapa ke nau nae chehron ko sarkaar main shaamil kiya gaya, chah ko mantrimandal se baahar kar diya gaya or mantriyon ke vibhaagon main bhi khaasi tabdili kii gai
 Among the amazing changes that took place were the considerable progress made for Nirmala Sitharaman, who was made Union Minister of Defense
 udhar, un tamaam afvaahon ko bhi darkinar kar diya gaya ki jad (you) athwa annadramuk ko bhi mantrimandal main jagah mil jaaegi
 Its political message was broadly clear: work or move
 acha kaam karne vaale mantriyon ko tarakkee mil gai or kharaab pradarshan karne vaale mantriyon ko yaa to baahar kar diya gaya yaa phir unka kad chota kar diya gaya
 Rajeev Pratap Rudy, Minister of State in the Ministry of Skill Development, had to pay the price for not doing enough to make the Prime Minister's dream in this area a reality
 teen anya rajyamantriyon ko tarakkee dekar cabinet mantri bana diya gaya—inamen sitaraman ke alaava piyush goyal or dharmendra pradhan shaamil the
 Goyal was given the Ministry of Railways in place of Suresh Prabhu and Prabhu was given the Ministry of Industry and Commerce
 mantrimandal main nae shaamil kiye gaye purv grih sachiv aar
 K
 singh ko goyal kaa urja or akshay urja vaala vibhaag de diya gaya (yah kuch ascharyajanak tha kyonki goyal ne desh main urja kii haalat ko naatakeey tareeke se sudhaar diya tha)
 But Modi's biggest political move was to make Sitharaman the defense minister
 ve purnakalik raksha mantri kaa daayitv sanbhaalane vaali pehali mahila ban gayi
 Indira Gandhi also took charge as Defense Minister in 1975 and 1980-82, but at that time she was looking after this department as Prime Minister
 yah spasht rup se ek bada daanv tha or yah mana ja rahaa he ki is ek kadam ke peeche pradarshan kaa ganit kam or chaunkaane vaala maamla zyada tha
 Usually Modi adds a surprising aspect to his work
 sutron kaa kahana he ki sitaraman ko raksha mantralay kii kaman modi ke aagrah, unki apni nishtha, eemaandaaree or die gaye nirdesh se aage na badaae kii unki aadat ke chalate saunpi gai
 However, Sitharaman's critics in the party say that she has often been right-left on occasions to take bold decisions
 vaanijya mantri ke rup main unke kaarykaal ke dauraan bhartiya niryaat paridrishy behad kamjor rahaa
 However, in the following months, he improved slightly (though his efforts are attributed less to the deficiency and more to the global situation)
 udyog vibhaag main kuch khaas halkon main unka pradarshan acha rahaa
 It is important to mention here that such staggering steps of the Prime Minister have yielded mixed results in the past
 masalan, smriti irani ko bhi thik isi tarah 2014 main maanav sansaadhan mantralay main lekar aayaa gaya tha lekin phir pichley pherbadal main unka vibhaag badal dena padaa
 However, a source close to the Prime Minister who has worked with Sitharaman says, "he has the ability to learn fast
" 
 
 ve is imtihaan main khari utrengi
 "some people are rude
 ke
 Singh was also surprised to be inducted into the cabinet
 ve bihar chunaavon ke dauraan bhaajapa ke tikat vitaran ko lekar kaaphi khafa the or yahaan tak ki unhone rajya ke party netritv par tikaton ke liye paisa lene kaa bhi aarope lagaaya tha
 But very few people will know that he, along with Arun Jaitley, played a key role in bringing Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar back to NDA
 jaahir he, aar
 K
 singh par bhi kadi nigahen rahengi
 Many are also skeptical about whether a general bureaucrat will be able to run the Ministry of Energy with the same efficiency as the innovator Goel
 is bich prabhu kaa kad chota karne ke peeche kii vajah keval ek ke baad ek rail haadase nahin hai
 Top sources in the BJP say that their performance in some core areas was not enough, such as not being able to increase freight and passenger traffic, while their emphasis on services like cleaning and eating was excessive
 kaamkaaj dikhaane par modi ke jor kaa sabase badhibia namoona un do visheshgyon ko mantrimandal main shaamil karne se dikhaai detaa he, jo saansad bhi nahin hai
 Hardeep Singh Puri is a former IFS officer and has been a permanent representative of India at the United Nations
 udhar, alphons kannanthanam kerala se purv iees adhikari hai
 But there are slight discrepancies here as well
 alphons ek kaabil prashaasak hai jinhone dilli main palika ayukta rahete hue 'demolision main' kii kchayaati arjeet kii thi
 As Minister of State, he has been made Minister of State in Electronics and IT departments along with being given independent charge of the Ministry of Tourism
 udhar, puri ne kabhi shahari vikaas kaa kaam nahin kiya lekin unhen awaas or shahari maamalon kaa mantralay diya gaya he
 Puri faces a lot of challenge because the central government's urban development program for the poor is not going well
 dharmendra pradhan ko khaasi tarannki dekar purna cabinet mantri kaa darja de diya gaya
 Along with the petroleum, oil and gas ministries he already has, he has been given additional charge of the Ministry of Skill Development
 yah shaayad garibon ke liye ujjwala rasoi gas silendar skim ke safal kriyanvayan kaa tohfa he, jisane party kii chhavi ke liye chamatkaar kiya he
 Out of the target of 5 crore BPL connections to be given by the year 2019, Pradhan is already 2
 8 karod conection de chuke hai
 They have also been successful in bringing transparency to a large extent in the oil and gas sector, which has been infamous for scams and irregularities
 ab agar ve kaushal vikaas mantralay kii surat badal pate hai to unka sarkaar ke bheetar kad kaaphi had tak bad jayega
 a major discovery in the reshuffle has been in the form of Gajendra Singh Shekhawat
 jodhpur ke ye saansad rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke saath takaraav ke mod main rahe hai
 He has been made the Minister of State in the Ministry of Agriculture and is behind this with his measures to address governance-related problems in areas such as Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) in agriculture, solar energy and welfare schemes, as well as popularizing them through social media forums
 Contributed a lot
 yakeenan, isaki vajah se kora jaisi citon par bhi shekhavat ke khaase foloar hai
 Sources say that Modi was so impressed with Shekhawat's work that he was asked to give a presentation to BJP mps in this regard in the last parliamentary session
 yah bhi pradhanmantri kaa ek chaunkaau kadam mana ja rahaa he
 Obviously, the Prime Minister's emphasis is on showing functioning
 yah to sabhi ko pataa he ki pradhanmantri ganga punaroddhar mantralay main uma bharti ke kaamkaaj se khush nahin the
 Therefore, this department was handed over to the all-skilled Nitin Gadkari
 gadakari ne kaam main teji laane ke tareeke sujhane ke liye pehle hi ek mantristareey tascaforce kaa elaan kar diya he
 The Tourism Department has been taken over from the Minister of State for Culture and Tourism Ministries Mahesh Sharma
 vaise ve doctor hai or sangh ke netaaon ke pasandida bhi (mantralay ke apane kaamkaaj ke chalate kam balki apane medical conekshnon ke chalate zyada)
 But after the reshuffle, the most difficult task is that of Piyush Goyal - Improvement of Railways and Coal India Limited
 kaa nijeekaran karnaa (koyala vibhaag abhi unheen ke paas he) jo ve trade unionon ke dabaav samet kai karkon ke chalate ab tak kar paane main naakaam rahe hai
 They will have to face the same challenge in railways, where the unions are quite strong
 railway main khastahal suraksha tantra kaa ek kaaran badi sankhya main padon kaa khaali rahanaa he
 About 1 at this time
 21 lakh aise pad khaali pade hai
 Most of these expenses are kept empty to save
 phir aadhunikeekaran kii prakriya bhi badi dhimi he
 That would mean speeding up and reducing jobs
 is disha main phir se unionen aade aaengi
 That is, the challenge is formidable
 mahatvapurn yah he ki party kii varishthata or nishtha kaa bhi inaam diya gaya he
 Among the new ministers, Virender Kumar is a six-time MP and the controversial Anant Kumar Hegde is a five-time MP
 shiv pratap shukla uttar pradesh main chaar baar vidhayak rah chuke hai or aath saal rajya main cabinet mantri bhi rahe hai, ve party ke puraane diggaj hai
 All three are from the Sangh background
 lihaaja, sangh kii chintaaon kaa bhi dhyaan rakhaa gaya he
 There is talk in the party that Jaitley has become very strong because all his special people - Goyal, Pradhan, Sitharaman and Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi have got promotion and reward
 haalanki modi ke najdiki sutron kaa kahana he ki ekmaatr aadhaar kaamkaaj tha
 BJP president Amit Shah told India Today, "the reshuffle defines four words - skill, professionalism and political efficiency and loyalty to achieve progress
" or phir party tathaa sarkaar kii praathamiktaaon ko dhyaan main rakhana
 "the BJP and the Sangh felt that before the 2019 elections, it is extremely important to completely revamp the government machinery
" yahi kaam modi ne kiya
 Australian cricket team vice-captain Michael Clarke has said that the decision to collect Andrew Symonds from the team was taken collectively in the case of breach of discipline during the three-match ODI series against Bangladesh in August
 australian akhbaar 'da age' ke anusaar clark ne kaha ki log mujhe galat samaj rahe hai
 i did not decide to remove Symonds from the team alone
 vah faisla team netritv kaa tha
 The team that Clarke is referring to includes regular captain Ricky Ponting, coach Tim Nilsen and manager Steve Bernad
 clark ne is baat kaa bhi khandan kiya ki unke or symonds ke bich kisi tarah kaa manmutav he
 He said that this is wrong
 main or symonds dost the, hai or rahenge
 i will say this much as long as the breath goes, my friend and Symonds' friends will stay
 main chahta hum ki symonds jald se jald team main waapas lauten

 He has questioned why the government decided to change his date of birth when he has spent 36 years in service and he got promotion throughout his career
 general singh ne yah kadam apane or raksha mantralay ke bich maheenon se jari khinchataan ke baad uthaaya he jiske dauraan unhone mantralay main do baar vaidhanik gyaapan diye
 Defense Minister AK Antony recently rejected his statutory representation after which all internal appeal options for General Singh on the issue were exhausted
 sarkaar ke is nirnay se general singh ko 31 may ko avkashgrahan karnaa hoga
 He says that his actual date of birth should be considered as 10 May 1951 as the same date is mentioned in his matriculation certificate
 lekin raksha mantralay ne unke daawey ko khaarij kar diya tha kyonki endie pariksha ke liye upiessi pravesh farm main unki janmatithi 10 may 1950 darj he
 In a press conference held on Friday last, the army chief had kept all his options open without disclosing his strategy on the matter

 This is the last full budget of the government before Lok Sabha elections 2019, so the government can make a big announcement on the employment front
 gauratlab he ki chaar saal pehle satta main aane par hi modi sarkaar ne rojgaar ko mukhya praathamikta bataate hue har saal ek karod naukariyon ke srijan kii baat kahi thi
 But the reality is that the government only 1 every year
 35 lakh naukariyon kaa srijan kar pai he
 Now, all the policy-makers of the government are trying to prove that adequate employment is being created in the country on the basis of EPF data

 NITI Aayog, working in this direction, prepared a policy paper this month

 Some of the major points of this paper are as follows - 1
 desh kii jansankhya kaa 45 fisadi hissajideepi keus 17 fisadi par nirbhar he, jisamen mahaj 3 fisadi kii dar se badhat ho rahi he
 On the other hand, 55% of the population is dependent on 83% of the GDP which is growing at 9% per annum (manufacturing and services)
 2
 Women constitute just 27 percent of the labor force, while 75 percent are male partners
 3
 The centers of economic growth should be sectors with intensive employment
 4
 The recent situation is that a large part of the economic growth comes from low employment sectors like finance, real estate etc
 zyada rojgaar kam vetan vaale sectors main he
 More than 80 percent of the firm has 50 or so employees
 bharat ko apane shram kanoon main badlaav karnaa hoga taaki vitt or buniyadi dhaancha sector ko madad mil sake
 5
 is samay kareeb 1
 There are over 23 million surplus workers, while 60 million new workers come every year
 6
 Fixed-term and high-wage employment will have to be encouraged
 7
 Differences in take home salary and CTC will occur
 15,000 se kam vetan waalon ke liye katautee kaa hissaa kam karnaa hoga

 (dailyo
 in se saabhaar) Bollywood actress Priyanka Chopra has made her comeback to Bollywood after a long time by filming Sky Is Pinkke
 pichley shuukravaar bhartiya box offis par relies hui is film ko kaaphi dhimi shuruyaat mili he
 It can be said that Priyanka Chopra has failed to get any magic at the Indian box office

 Apparently in terms of taking the budget of the film, the pace of this film directed by Shonali Bose is much slower
 film kii kahani sachhee ghatana par aadhaarit he or isamen priyanka chopra ke alaava farhaan akhtar ne lead role play kiya he
 Priyanka has comeback after 3 years through the film
 film main dangal star jaayra wasim or newtomar actor rohit saraaf bhi ahm kirdaar nibhaa rahe hai
 The film is based on the story of Motivational speaker Ayesha Chaudhary, who passed away due to a disease called pulmonary fibrosis
 film main aaysha or uske parivaar ke stregal kii kahani dikhaai gai he
 The movie is being described as very emotional
 jai gangaajal thi pichhali film-priyanka chopra kii pichhali hindi film jai gangaajal thi
 Priyanka has not done any Hindi film since this film, directed by Prakash Jha
 vah america chali gayi or vahaan unhone hollywood film bewaach main kaam kiya

 uttar kerala ke kasargod jile kaa yah mul nivasee ab dubai main rahata he or bharat main sone kii taskari kaa 'bichauliya’ he
 In October this year, he illegally sent 20 kg of gold in the country
 beshak, vah apni agali khep ke bare main munh nahin kholana chahta lekin itnaa jarur bataata he ki kerala ke hawaii addon par uske sona le jane vaale kuch 'karier’ (log) haal main pakade gaye isliye vah rajya ke root ke istemaal se bachegaa
 "I would now like the state-owned airports like Coimbatore and Mangalore," she told Business Today, an India Today group magazine during her visit to Kozhikode in north Kerala
 ”kasargod kaa yah bashinda darasal hawala agent he lekin use sone kii taskari kaa bhi anubhav he
 In 1988-89, when gold imports were prohibited under the Gold Control Act, he worked as a 'carrier' bringing gold from Saudi Arabia
 116 gram ke sone ke 20 tukdon kii khep laane par use har tukade ke peeche 2,000 ru
 He used to earn but he used to take double amount for a 30 piece consignment
 1991-92 main aarthik udaarikaran ke saath sone ke aayaat ko nammaatr kaa shulk adaa karne par kanuunan vaid kar diya gaya to sone kii taskari phydemand nahin rahi
 Then he started smuggling currency
 lekin ab do dashak baad sone kii taskari phir shuru ho gai he
 It started in the government's high circles with the realization that large quantities of gold imports are one of the main reasons for the current account's unabated growing deficit
 yah ghaataa 2012-13 main 88

 Finance Minister P
 chidambaram ne maujuuda vitt varsh main hi chaalu khate ke ghate ko 60 arab dollar ke str par neeche laane ke lakshya ke maddenjar sone par aayaat shulk main dhire-dhire badhotaree kar di
 This charge was 2 percent as of January 2012, which has now increased to 10 percent
 sone ke aayaat par bandishen bhi lagaai gayi
 For example, excise duty was increased from 7 percent to 9 percent and the obligation to export a minimum of 20 percent of imported gold was fixed
 in upayon kaa asar hua or sone ke aayaat kaa aadhikarik aankada is saal may main 161
 Reduced from 38 tons to just 7 in September
 24 ton rah gaya
 But these drastic measures also had unexpected 'side-effects'
 jaisaa ki bhartiya rigerv bank ke governor raghuram rajan ne khud sweekaar kiya, ''ek chintaa yah he ki kya sone kii taskari bade paimaane par ho rahi he or hawala ke jariye bhugtan ho rahaa he
 He admitted that smuggling of gold has increased but it is still on a small scale
 kasargod ke banshide kii tarah bichauliyon kii jimmedaari sone kii khep bhartiya agenton tak pahunchane kii hoti he
 He seeks a carrier, hands over consignments to him, arranges air travel on both sides, arranges for his safe travel by bribing customs and airport officials through his contacts

 Carrier supplies consignment to 'landing agents' in India
 ve use khudara dukaanon par pahunchaate hai
 The old-time mafia kingpin Haji Mastan, or Karim Lala, was mostly a 'landing agent' of gold consignments in smuggling through the sea, the gold control law which came into force as a government order in the mid-1960s
 Were activated after daaud ibrahim bhi shuru main landing agent hi tha
 How does this system work today? The middleman states that gold smuggling is related to hawala and currency smuggling
 hawala ke paise se hi yah dhandha chalata he, taskar kii to maamuli rakam hi lagi hoti he
 The smuggler buys gold with the hawala operator's money
 agar khep badi hui to bichauliye kii talash hoti he varanaa taskar khud hi karier dhundh letaa he
 Gold smugglers, mostly Indians, are based in all Gulf countries but mostly work through agents based in Dubai
 dubai main sona khareednaa puri tarah kanoonee he or uske badale main raseed milti he
 The smuggler deals the price in India through an agent, it is called 'cutting', this rate does not change even with the supply of gold, no matter how high in the world market
 dubai se sona baahar le janaa bhi puri tarah kanoonee he
 Carrier is also given a receipt along with a consignment of gold, so that he can show it to the authorities at the airport in Dubai if needed
 agar khep badi hui to dubai police se khep ke vajan or karier ke naam kaa certificate bhi hasil kar liya jaataa he
 In India, the consignments are handed over to the consignment landing agent by dodging or bribing officials
 agar khep pakadi jaati he to puraa ghaataa taskar hi uthaata he isliye uski jeb kaa baari hona jaruri he
 "it is a complete system," says a hawala agent from Kannur district in Kerala, who runs a business in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia
 har khilaadi kii bhoomika spasht he or gopneeyata bhi barti jaati he
 For example, the carrier is not known to anyone other than the person who handed over the air ticket
 kai baar to bichauliye ko bhi pataa nahin hota ki asli taskar koun he
 "such precautions are necessary so that the entire system does not get caught when the carrier is caught
 kannur ke is bascindia ke mutabik, saudi arab main kareeb 200 madhyam str ke hawala agent hai jabaki dubai main 500 ke aasapaas
 Economy How much does a smuggler earn? The assessment of a hawala agent is as follows
 sone kaa daam upar-neeche hote rahete hai
 But, suppose someday the price of gold (24 carat pure gold) is 26
 30 lakh ru
 Per kg
 taskar apane bhartiya saathi se bharat main 'landing daam’ kareeb 30 lakh ru
 Per kg, thus at 3 per kg
 70 lakh ru
 There will be profit
 vishwa bazaar main 26
 30 lakhs
 kii keemat hone par bharat main aadhikarik channel se kharidne par yah prati kilo 31 lakh ru
 Will have more than isliye khudara str par bhi acha kamishan dena hoga
 The expenses on both sides of the carrier, especially air travel, have to be borne by the smuggler, which is Rs 30,000
 padataa he
 In addition, the carrier gets 1,000 dirhams (rs 17,000 per kg)
 ) kamishan dena padegaa
 Thus, the total profit on the first one kg consignment is 3
 20 lakh ru
 is
 agar karier ek kilo se zyada le jaataa he to munafa bad jaataa he kyonki atirikt sirf kamishan hi dena padataa he
 Before the increase in import duties, when gold smuggling was very low, only those returning from Gulf countries, especially laborers, were used as carriers
 lekin taskari main teji aane or munafa badaae par karier bhi badal gaye hai
 Recent cases of seizure of gold suggest that women are also being used in it
 yahaan tak ki bal-bacchon vaale pariwaron or vimaanakarmiyon tak se karier kaa kaam liya ja rahaa he
 Says a senior customs officer in Kozhikode, "until recently, there was no pregnant woman wearing a burqa or a woman with children in her lap
 ”adhik chust tareeke apnaane vaale karier ab kamishan bhi zyada maangate hai
 Now a new element has been added to it, 'arranger', who make a career
 haal main mahila kariyaron kii giraftaar ke baad ab unki maang ghat gai he
 The middlemen believe that the arrest of such carriers creates more furore in the media, which is not good for this business
 ab zyada maang khaskar gramin prishthbhumi ke yuva bharatiyon kii he
 How is gold hidden? Small amounts can be hidden in pockets or bags, such that there is no doubt, but a different method is adopted if the quantity is several kilos
 police or seemaa shulk adhikariyon kaa maananaa he ki dubai main chupaane main maahir yani 'concilment agenton’ kii jamaat taiyaar ho gai he or ye sabhi bhartiya hai
 These agents specialize in inventing new ways to hide gold in emergency lights, washing machines, wheelchairs, children's bicycles, TV sets, etc
 ye har teen kilo sona chupaane ke liye 500 dirhaam lete hai
 Kerala is an important destination for smuggling gold
 trishur, koduvaili, vengara jaise shahar iske pramukh centre hai
 Traders here spend gold in the entire state and the entire country
 masalan, koskid jile main chote-se shahar koduvaili main mahaj 50 meter ke ilaake main jevaraat kii 200 dukaane hai
 Shopkeepers say that the appetite of gold among Indians is so much that sales are not a problem
 angamalli kasbe main majhele str kaa ek dukandaar bataata he ki avaidh tareeke se aayaa sona kharidne se na sirf aayaat shulk bachataa he, balki 1 pratishat waite or rajya ke anya kar dene se chhutkaaraa mil jaataa he
 a wholesaler in Kozhikode says, "shopkeepers from both organized and unorganized sector of jewelry are dependent on smuggled gold
" sangathit kshetra vaale apni jarurat kaa kareeb 30 pratishat taskaron se lete hai jabaki asangathit kshetra main 50 pratishat ke aasapaas khapat he
 Big shops also cannot run from authorized businesses
 ve apane khaaton main anadhikrut channelon se aae sone ko 'purana sona’ yaa 'scarap sona’ kahkar darj karte hai
 "there is no sign of its end
 2013 main sone kii anumaanit maang 950 ton thi jabaki abhi tak aadhikarik channelon se 400 ton hi aayaa he
 How this deficiency will be fulfilled, it can be easily guessed
 agenton kaa anumaan he ki kam-se-kam agle saal aam chunaavon tak shubh din jari rahenge
 Import duties will not be reduced
 shaayad ek vajah chunaav prachaar ke liye hawala ke paison ko taskari ke sone ke jariye aasaani se desh main laana bhi he

 It is a coincidence that the 2011 ODI between India and England at the Cardiff ground was in many ways similar to the second match of the series on Wednesday
 kai aankadon main itani samanta thi ki yakeen karnaa mushkil he
 But the only difference was the outcome of the match
 2011 or 2014 main cardiff main khele gaye maichon main thim ye samanthaayen:1
 England won the toss in both matches
 2
 In both matches, England won the toss and chose bowling
 3
 In both matches, India scored 304 runs for 6 wickets
 4
 India captain Dhoni hit a half-century in both matches
 5
 In both matches, India scored 1 century and 2 half-centuries
 6
 In both matches, the rain disrupted, the decision taken by Duckworth Louis rule
 7
 In both matches, England got a target of 295 runs in 47 overs based on the duckworth-louis rule
 itani samaantaaon ke baavjood jo sabase bada fark yah tha ki 2011 main team india 6 wicket se haar gai thi, lekin 2014 main bharat ne england ko 133 ranon se haraa diya

 In the play by French playwright Florian Zeller, Andre is playing the central role of senior actor Naseeruddin Shah
 yah naatak alzimer ke marij kii gaayab hoti yaaddaasht main jhaankne kii koshish karata he
 Shah says, "the effort is to have the audience share Andre's mental state, leaving him in a similar state of confusion

 Apart from the main character, the rest is double cast
 shah kehete hai, ''isamen bhale thodaa ghamand dikhe par is role ke liye main kisi or ke bare main soch hi nahin saktaa tha
 "zeller's motivational script makes him discover something new about his character after every show
" ''yahi to jaadu he
 In the midst of a performance, you discover something else about the character and the audience is also a witness to it
 '' 2012 main yah naatak likhane vaale jailer ise ek trygic prahasan bataate hai
 Translated into English by Christopher Hampton, this twisted tale has an agile but comic character in addition to the mental imbalance of how it affects the patient and his chimer, Andre's daughter Annie (starring Ratna Pathak Shah / Heeba Shah)
 mottle ke production main manch ke chaaron taraf baithe darshakon se charitra ke bheetar har taraf se ghire hone kaa ek bhay ban saktaa he, lekin isse use ek tarah kii khushi bhi milti he
 At first Shah was thinking that the audience should sit exactly in the middle of the action of the play, just as someone is sitting on the couch in the drawing room of their house
 par unheen ke shadbradon main, ''yah thodi ati ho jaati
 All the audience could not think of any other way to take Samo in it
 '' unke liting diziner aghrya lahidi ne darshakon ko chautarafa bithaane kaa suzav diya
 Shah found some of West's more realistic sets to be 'silly', so he used a few chairs, a sofa and a table
 lakdi ke farsh par safed tepe ko gaur se dekhen to aapako ek makaan kaa dhaancha najar aayega, naatak jab aage badhata he to aapako samaj main aayega ki vahaan ek living room, ek kichan or ek bedroom he
 Shah says, "the magic lies in this hypothesis, you can inspire the audience to imagine how much
 ''isi tarah se sound effect bhi bilkul sateek samay par hote hai
 The lively sounds of the wine bottle and the cabinet door opening further add to the drama's impact
 naatak ko antim rup dene se pehle shah ko dimag main yah baat rakhni thi ki darshak chaaron taraf baithe honge
 "instead of becoming some kind of boundary, it opened up many possibilities for us," he says
 '' masalan, yah naatak agar kisi saamaanya stage par hota to abhinayta ek-duusare ke saamne tirchhe khadey hote, lekin yahaan ve ek-duusare ke aamane-saamne vaise hi khadey ho sakate the, jaise ki saamaanya jivan main hote hai
 However, his boldest experiment is probably the decision to play the drama for a month in a row: until September 30 at NCPA and then at the Prithvi Theater in November
 aise prayog ke bare main shah lambey samay se sapana dekh rahe the
 He says, "my back has started bothering some, but being on the stage cures every disease

 agar aap kisi ladki ko impress karnaa chaah rahe hai to ek baat samaj lijie ki kisi ladki ko impress karne ke liye koi tay niyam nahin hai
 But it is definitely that by changing some of your habits, you can win over anyone's heart
 ladkiyaan jaldi kisi par bharosa nahin karatin or aaj ke samay main jabaki zyaadaatar ladkiyaan aatmanirbhar hai tounhen impress kar panaor mushkil hi he
 In the earlier times where most marriages were done from home to family, in today's time, the social life, earning source, looks, intelligence and behavior of the boy with family also matters a lot
 to doston, agar aap ab tak ye nahin samaj paae hai ki koi ladki aapke saath date par kyon nahin janaa chaahati to ho saktaa he ki aapaki approach or pregence main koi kami rah gai ho
 In such a situation, you need to know what are those things because of which no girl wants to go on a date with you
 1
 Is it not that you misinterpret everything? agar koi ladki aapke saath hans-bol rahi he to iskaa ye bilkul matlab nahin ki wo aapse pyaar karti he
 Most single men misinterpret the girl's laughter
 2
 Somewhere your jokes are silly
 zyaadaatar purush ashleel joke sunaanaa pasand karte hai
 Maybe the girl sitting with you may make such jokes uncomfortable for you
 aise main bekaar ke jokes sunaanaa band kar den
 3
 agar aapaki baton se ladki ko ye ehsaas ho jaae ki aap shaareerik sambandhon ke prati bahut utaavle hai to bhi wo aapse kanni kaat sakati he
 Not only this, his thinking towards you will also be affected
 4
 Do you live somewhere chaotic? If yes, maybe some girl likes you
 zyaadaatar ladkiyaan luks ke saath koi samjhauta nahin karatin
 5
 kahin aapaki baton se ye to nahin jhalkata ki aap bahut ghamandi hai or sirf apni hi chalaanaa chaahate hai
 If yes, believe that going on a date with a girl is as difficult as breaking a mountain

 The latest case is in Sultanpur district, where district level officials, in gross violation of MNREGA rules, bought cameras for village heads, which were of no use to them
 bataate hai ki is saal july main jab pinki joval ne yahaan jiladhish ke rup main prabhaar sambhala to gram pradhan koi 130 gaanvon vaale dostpur or kudebhar vikaas khandon main camere kharidne lage
 Each chieftain spent around Rs 6,000
 kii laagat vaala yah camera kharid liya
 a Block Development Officer (BDO) of the district admitted, "we knew that this camera is not allowed under the MNREGA scheme and its centralized procurement is also a crime
" '' lekin bakaul ukt adhikari, jile ke ucchstareey adhikari ke dabaav main do vikaas khandon main yah kharid kar lee gai
 Village princes have no camera work and there was no justification for large scale purchase of this sensitive device
 adhikarik taur par, ye camere manaregaa ke tahat hone vaale kaaryon ke chitra khinchakar unhen upar ke str par dene ke vaaste kharid liye gaye
 On finding out, a BSP leader informed the matter to the Chief Minister's Office and Principal Secretary of Rural Development Manoj Kumar, who ordered an inquiry into alleged violation of MNREGA rules in Sultanpur district

 '' joval kii bhoomika ke bare main puche jane par pramukh sachiv kaa kahana tha ki isaki jaanch kii ja rahi he
 The Collector of Sultanpur is accused of allowing such procurement, which is in violation of MNREGA scheme rules
 bataaya jaataa he ki sabhi camere haryana kii ek hi company kumaar ji se kharide gaye hai
 "this is another mistake made in the purchase because VAT on camera in Uttar Pradesh is only 4 percent whereas in Haryana it is 14 percent, so there was no point in buying such a camera outside Uttar Pradesh, when it is Was available in the state at a cheaper rate
 ''sultanpur main camaron kii kharid manaregaa kosh tak hi simit nahin he
 It is known that such cameras have also been purchased from the fund of Rifle Club
 yah sthapit parampara he ki kisi hathiyaar kaa license jari karte samay aavedak se ek moti rakam rifl club ko dilaai jaati he, jiskaa niyantran jila prashasan ke paas rahata he or isaki mukhya bhoomika licensodharakon ke liye nishanebaaji kaa abhyaas yojit karnaa he
 But in practice nothing like this happens and the membership of Rifle Club in various districts is worth crores of rupees
 adhikari hadap lete hai or unka durupyog karte hai
 In Sultanpur too, the money of Rifle Club has been diverted towards building a guest house and now the purchase of cameras
 vidhayak nidhi or saansad nidhi kii tarah manaregaa bhi sarkari adhikariyon ke bhrashtachar or paisa luutane kaa ek or strot ban gaya he
 8,500 crore for the current financial year 2010-11 under MGNREGA in Uttar Pradesh
 manjuur kiye gaye hai, lekin aath maah biit jane ke baad bhi is rakam kaa 30 pratishat kharch nahin hua he
 Says Dixit, "I can say with confidence that hundreds of crores of rupees in Uttar Pradesh
 kii rakam hadap lee gai he or kuchhek maamalon main karrwai ko chhodkar mayawati sarkari ise rokane ke liye kuch nahin kar rahi
 "they have looted large sums of money by visiting several districts
" inamen naksal prabhavit jila sonbhadra bhi he or isaki report unhone kendriya gramin vikaas mantralay ko bhej di he
 In his report, Dixit has clearly stated that to raise money from MNREGA, the district administration has declared more than 300 villages as Naxal affected whereas the fact is that one-fourth of its villages have not seen any Naxal activities
 And the announcement was made deliberately to get money
 unki report ke baad choube ne bhi khud kaamon kaa nirihnan kiya or manaregaa ke paise ke durupyog par chintaa jatigram str par manaregaa yojana ke tahat paise kii paryaapt uplabdhta ek vajah he ki 2005 ke panchayat chunaavon ke mukaable is baar gram pradhan pad ke liye ummidavaaron main 20 pratishat vruddhi hui he
 700 crore to Sonbhadra district in the last three years
 se adhik raashi kaa aavanton hua jo rajya main sarvaadhik tha
 In one village in the district, 71 candidates were competing for the post of village head, which was the highest in any one village
 isse spasht he ki gram pradhanon ne manaregaa ke paise par apni nazren gada rakhi hai, isliye is pad ko hathiyaane ke liye kadaa muqabla hota he
 This time the candidates contesting on the village head post got lakhs of rupees to lure voters
 kharch kiye
 The NREGA, which was renamed as MNREGA, launched in February 2006, played an important role in development at the village level and created one crore man days by guaranteeing minimum 100 days of employment to the poor of the villages
 yah yojana graminon main is kadar lokapriy hui ki 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main isane congress kii vijay main mahatvapurn bhoomika adaa kii
 Encouraged by its success, the UPA government expanded the scheme and increased its budget allocation
 lekin jaise ki jawahar rojgaar yojana sareekhe anya sarkari kaaryakramon ke saath hua, rajya ke sarkari adhikari apane nihit swaarthon ke liye is yojana ko bhi duhane lage hai
 An example of this is that in many places lakhs of rupees in the name of hybrid seeds from MNREGA money
 ke khilone kharid liye gaye hai or vah bhi kaagajon par
 The most unfortunate thing is that this corruption has become mostly unbridled, due to which Dixit has given it a new name Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Exploitation Guarantee Scheme

 The Union Cabinet has approved increasing the salary of mps to 50 thousand rupees
 vetan badaye jane kii saansadon kii maang par vitt mantri pranav mukherjee nekaha ki sarkaar sansad ke isi satr main ek vidheyak laane kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 There was a continuous demand for increase in salary of mps by members of political parties
 saansadon ke vetan or bhatte sambandhi adhinium 1954 main sanshodhan kaa prastaav tha
 The increased salary will be applicable from the 15th Lok Sabha
 saansadon ko abhi solah hajaar rupe pratimah vetan miltaa he
 Now it will increase three times
 isse basic selary badhkar 50 hajaar rupee ho jayega
 Regardless of the difficulties the common man of the country is going through, inflation may be swallowing everyone's happiness like a sursa
 saansadon ko sarkari khazaane se maalamaal karne kii taiyaari puri ho chuki he
 Now they are going to meet the desired salary
 jis nai pagaar kaa prastaav cabinet ne manzur kiya he uske mutabik saansadon kii jeb main pehle se kai guna zyaada rakam har maheene jaaegi
 There has been a constant uproar in both the houses of Parliament regarding the increase in salary
 saansad chaahate hai teen guni tankhwaah or argedy adhyaksh lalu yadav sawaal uthaa rahe hai ki mahangaai ke jamaane main pagaar badaye bina kaam kaise chalegaa?saansad chaahate hai ek sachiv se zyada tankhwaah or aaie aapako bataate hai ki agar saansadon kii selary kaa vidheyak paas ho gaya to unhen kitna paisa milegaa
 The basic salary of mps is 16 thousand
 jise badhaakar 50 hajaar rupee maheenaa karnaa he, yani teen guna se bhi zyada
 The government pays 20 thousand rupees every year to the mp's office
 ise badhaakar teen guna yani 60 hajaar rupee karne kaa prastaav he
 Parliamentary constituency allowance to mps is to be increased from 20 thousand to 40 thousand rupees every month
 sansad satr ke dauraan roj milane vaala 1000 rupee badhaakar do hajaar rupee kiya janaa he
 One and a half million phone calls of mps are free
 jise badhaakar do lakh kiye jane hai
 Whereas 34 free air tickets received every year are to be increased to 50
 saansadon ko har kilometre par 13 rupee kiraaya bhatta miltaa he, jise badhaakar 20 rupee kiya janaa he
 If this total income of mps is mixed, then they get 33 thousand rupees every month
 saansad chaahate hai ki ye vetan 1 lakh 24 hajaar rupee prati maah kar di jaae
 Not only this, if this bill is passed, the pension to retired mps will be increased from 8 thousand to 20 thousand
 donon sadanon main mache hangaame ke baad vitt mantri pranab mukherjee ne maan liya ki sarkaar isi satr main saansadon ke vetan bhatte par bill laaegi or badha hua vetan 15 veen loksabhaa se hi lagu ho jayega
 It is worth noting that till a few days ago, these mps were creating a ruckus on the issue of inflation
 lekin puure desh kii janata se jude is mudde par ek baar se adhik charchaa nahin ho saki thi
 That discussion was also inconclusive
 wo hi mahangaai ek baar phir saansadon kii jubaan par chadhi, lekin is baar charchaa shuru hui uski aad main malai kaatane kii
 When the matter came on his salary, these mps started demanding immediate action under the guise of the same inflation
 muslim personal lau board kii baithak main vivadarivyuu pitishan daakhil karne par hoga faislyodhya maamle main aae supreme court ke faisle par vichaar karne ke liye hone vaali ol india muslim personal lau board (AIMPLB) kii baithak vivaadon main aa gai
 According to sources, as soon as the meeting started at the Nadwa Islamic Center, the review petitions broke out
 baithak main kai netaa rivyuu pitishan ke khilaaf the to kai netaa baithak kii jagah ko lekar aapatti uthaa rahe the ki aakhir ilm ke centre main siyaasi or dharmik faisle kaise liya ja rahaa he
 The controversy increased so much that the meeting had to be canceled and shifted to a new place
 uniwarsity main siyaasi meeting kyon?is meeting ke bare main muslim dharmaguru sufian nijaami ne kaha, aaj kii baithak main rivyuu pitishan par faisla hoga ki muslimon ke liye masjid banane ke liye jameen lee jaae yaa nahin
 4 out of 6 litigants say that review petition should be filed
 haalanki aakhri faisla board ko lenaa he
 About 3
 30 baje press ko sambodhit kiya jayega
 On BJP MP Babul Supriyo's comment on Owaisi's statement, he said, "I don't want to comment on any political statement
" ham faisle se santusht nahin hai or agar rivyuu pitishan daakhil kii jaati he to yah hamaara sanvaidhanik adhikaar he
 He also said that after the dispute, now the meeting is being held at another place
 report ke mutabik lakhanu ke mumtaj muslim college main meeting ho rahi he
 Sufiyan Nizami said that AIMIM Chief Owaisi left from here after the dispute
 nijaami ne kaha ki jis tareeke se lakhanu main or khaskar nadwa main yah meeting ho rahi thi use lekar sawalia nishaan khadey ho rahe the ki aakhir uniwarsity main itnaa bada siyaasi faisla lene ke liye yah baithak kyon ho rahi thi
 Many members were also objecting that once the Supreme Court has decided, then what is the rationale of this meeting? Let me tell you that in this meeting of AIMPLB held yesterday, most of the Muslim leaders were in favor of review petition against the decision of Ayodhya, but some also appeared against it
 aaj isi masale par final muhar lagani he
 The Executive Committee of AIMPLB has 51 members
 ye sadsy ye tay karenge ki ayodhya par supreme court ke faisle ke khilaaf rivyuu pitishan daayar kiya jaae yaa nahin
 Apart from this, whether the Muslim side accepts the 5 acres of land given in the judgment or not
 pehle jaisi nahin rahegi duniya ke sabase bade finishr mahendra singh dhoni kii ballebaaji
 Dhoni will have to make changes in his batting
 dhoni antarrashtriya cricket main kadam rakhane ke saath hi haivi bat se ballebaaji karte aa rahe hai
 But now Dhoni will not be able to bat with a heavy bat
 dhoni ko apane shot sellection main phir dhyaan dena hoga, jiske liye unhen nets par pasinaa bahaanaa padegaa
 Dhoni will have to change batting When Mahendra Singh Dhoni comes on the field to bat, the big bowlers are afraid to put the ball in front of him
 dhoni kaa helicopter shot ne duniyabar ke gendbaajon main khauf paidaa kar rakhaa he
 But the bat with which Dhoni used to hit long sixes, now that bat will leave him
 ji haa, ek oktober se lagu ho rahe cricket ke nae ke niyamon ke mutabik balle kii motaai ab 40 millimetre se zyada nahin ho sakati he
 The thickness of the bat cannot be more than 40 millimeters
 Apart from Dhoni, there are many batsmen in the world who use heavy bats
 david warner kris gail or pollard hai jo cricket ke maidan par bade shots lagane ke liye jane jate hai
 They too must have changed their bat
 in ballebaajon ke balla or khaastaur se uskaa nichle hisse kii chaudaai 40 mimi se zyada he
 The width of Dhoni, Warner and Pollard's bats is more than 45 mm width of Hamendra Singh Dhoni's bat
 vahiin australia ke david warner 50 mimi chaudaai ke balle se khelte hai
 This allows them to attack the bowlers first
 khaas taur par khel ke chote praaroop main ve zyada khatarnaak ho jate hai
 After the new rule comes into force, everyone will have their eyes on these batsmen
 bihar main loksabhaa kii 40 siten ise behad ahm rajya bana detii hai
 Secondly, for the first time since 1977, Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad Yadav is not campaigning

 siyaasi or nijee donon staron par lalu prasad yadav kii kami kitni khalati he?aap lalu ji ko bihar se dur rakh sakate hai, par aap bihariyon ko lalu ji se dur nahin rakh sakate
 They are being harassed because they are devoted to social justice and secularism and the BJP is afraid of both these things
 yah pehla chunaav he jab ve swayan saath nahin hai
 Whenever i speak about Lalu ji in a public meeting, i see how worried people are for him
 nijee taur par udaasi kaa ehsaas he, par hakeekat ham jaanate hai
 They are facing (all this) because of political vendetta
 ham jaanate hai ki ye koun-si siyaasi takaton ne unke khilaaf sajeesh kii par unki ichhashakti todgaye main naakaam rahe
 Why do you call it 'political vendetta'? This was a legal process
 
 
 main 6 april ko ranchi unase milane gaya to milane nahin diya gaya, koi kaaran bhi nahin bataaya gaya, baavjood iske ki vah shanivaar kaa din tha jo jail prashasan ne mulakaaton ke liye tay kiya he
 i was told by journalists and doctors that if they needed medical examination, there were problems in front of the doctors under the cover of security to take them to the adjacent building within the campus of Ranchi Medical College
 lalu ji vahaan ilaaj ke liye hi hai, par vah bhi unhen nahin diya ja rahaa
 Not only this, the administration has banned all visitors to meet them from April 20

 i learned a lot from this
 jameen par rajd 31 fisadi musalamaanon or yadavon ke majboot vot bank ke saath shuruyaat kar rahaa he
 But Bihar is fighting 19 seats out of 40
 gathbandhan ke bhagidaar jeethanram maanjhi, mukesh sahani or upendra kushvaha abhi aajamaae nahin gaye hai
 It is possible that they could not get their votes transferred
 kushvaha, maanjhi 2015 main naakaam hue the
 In the 2015 assembly elections, the BJP was dusted off and the election was won by an overwhelming majority by the Grand Alliance
 maanjhi ji purv mukhyamantri or dalit netaa hai
 Kushwaha ji is the leader of the most backward castes
 sahani ji apana pehla chunaav lard rahe hai
 But the results will prove their ability
 lag yah rahaa he ki rajd apane vot sahyogi dalon ko transfar kar rahaa he, par ve rajd ke liye aisa nahin kar paa rahe
 i am constantly getting feedback from candidates and independent sources, everyone says that not only the votes are being transferred but the coalition partners are also working in full coordination
 nitish kumaar kii taraf se sulah kii peshkash sweekaar na kar paane par aapako afsos hoga? 2015 ke chunaav main ham dekh chuke hai ki rajd-jedy(you) kii takat ajey he
 Why regret You see what happened
 nitish ji ne paala badal liya
 He was forced by the BJP
 unhen bahaane kii jarurat thi, to hamaare khilaaf bhrashtachar ke nae maamle darj kiye gaye
 He takes great care of his image
 lekin ve hameshaa se jaanate the ki lalu ji ke paas unke khilaaf maamle the
 Even then he shook hands with us for the assembly elections and then cheated us in July 2017 as the BJP could take action against him in the creation scam
 2014 main tikona muqabla tha
 The 2019 election is a NDA versus coalition battle
 isamen 31 fisadi yadav-musalmaan vot kaaphi nahin bhi ho sakate
 Our party is for everyone
 2014 ke faisle ke aadhaar par vishleshan karne se aap galat nateezon par pahunchenge
 Nitish ji had a decision value in 2014
 to bhi endie or rajd-congress gathbandhan ke khilaaf chunaav ladaa to unke kareeb 30 ummidavaaron ne jamaantein ganvaain
 People have also seen that the Modi government had shown a dream and had a nightmare
 bihar package kahaan he? naukariyaan kahaan hai? 2014 main vot lene ke liye ve pichde virgon ke haq main bolte the par kaam unhone kulinon ke liye kiya
 BJP leaders are silent on the questions of livelihood, jobs, democracy and strengthening the backward
 log unhen apane vaadon se mukarne kii sajaa denge
 Your brother Tej Pratap has fielded two candidates against RJD candidates
 agar log chunaav laduya chaahate hai to ve ladenge
 Both the party and they (tej Pratap) also want to defeat the BJP
 baat bas itani he ki unhen yakeen he, koi doosraa ummidavaar aisa karne main zyada asardaar hoga
 But the party believes in someone else
 loktantr main to aisa hota he

 The captain faces a lot of criticism for the team's poor performance, but Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has no problem with being a 'punching bag', that is, if other players avoid coming under pressure
 bhartiya team pichley saal se bure daur se guzar rahi he or dhoni kii netritvkshmata par sawaal uthaae ja rahe he
 Dhoni, however, is ready to bear every criticism
 bharat kii pehle van-de main pakistan ke haathon haar ke baad dhoni ne kaha, ‘‘meri jitani bhi aalochanaayen hoti hai mujhe sweekaar he
 i feel good that i am a punching bag as it will put less pressure on the team
 aapako team main kuch is tarah ke khilaadiyon kii jarurat hoti he jo panching bag (aalochana sahane vaale) ban saken
 Sachin has been playing such a role for some time
 vah sara tanaav hataa dete hai
 i don't think everyone gets a chance to be a punching bag so I'm glad i can reduce the stress on the team a little bit
 ’’ Dhoni said that the sky was cloudy and nothing was good for India till the loss of the toss
 unhone kaha, ‘‘main samajhataa hum ki toss se shuruyaat kii jaae
 He bowled well after that
 jab tej gendbaajon ko madad mil rahi ho or gend swing kar rahi ho to gend sahi sthaan par pich karne se kaam banataa he
 If you look at their bowlers, they bowled really well
 ’’ tippaniyan Dhoni played a tremendous 113 runs under pressure but said that instead of getting a chance to score a century like this, he wants his top-order batsmen to perform well
 unhone kaha, ‘‘maine bahut adhik shatak nahin banaae hai jo main unamem kisi ek kaa chayan karun
 All the centuries are special for me
 nichle kram main chathe yaa saatven number par ballebaaji karte hue yadi aap shatak banaate ho, asal main aap aisa mauka nahin chaahate kyonki main chahta hum ki hamaara sheersh kram acha pradarshan kare

 That was in our mind, not how many runs i scored
 ’’ The Indian team has been going through a bad phase since last year and Dhoni's leadership is being questioned
 dhoni haalanki har tarah kii aalochana sahane ke liye taiyaar hai
 After India's defeat at the hands of Pakistan in the first one-day, Dhoni said, "I accept all the criticisms
 mujhe acha mahasoos hota he ki main panching bag hum kyonki isse team par kam dabaav rahegaa
 You need some such players in the team who can become punching bags
 sachin pichley kuch samay se aisi bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai
 They remove all the tension
 main nahin samajhataa ki prayek ko panching bag banane kaa mauka miltaa he isliye mujhe khushi he ki main team kaa thodaa tanaav kam kar saktaa hum
 '' dhoni ne kaha ki aasmaan par badal chhaae hue the or toss ganvaane se lekar aakhir tak bharat ke liye kuch bhi acha nahin rahaa
 He said, "I think to start with the toss

 He said, "I have not scored too many centuries which i can choose one of them
 mere liye sabhi shatak khaas hai
 If you score a century while batting at number six or seventh in the lower order, in reality you don't want such an opportunity because i want our top order to perform well
 ’’ Dhoni said, "but overall i am happy that i succeeded in scoring a century

 It was necessary for us to hold on to the crease so that we could get a respectable score

 This final match has once made it clear that both of them are currently the top players of tennis
 landan main jari atipi world tour finels ke pehle semifinal main novak jokovich ne japan ke kei nishikori ko teen set tak chale mukaable main 6-1, 3-6, 6-0 se haraa diya
 Apparently, in the two sets Djokovic won, he did not give Kei Nishikori any chance, although one set in the middle managed to win Nishikori
 vahiin, duusare semifinal main roger federer ne stenislas vavarinka ko behad romaanchak mukaable main 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 se haraakar final main pravesh kiya
 After losing the first set, Federer came close to a one-time defeat in the second set, but Wawrinka failed to convert four match points into a win, and Roger Federer made a stunning comeback to win the match
 kareeb 2 ghante 48 minute tak chale mukaable main federer ne dikhaa diya ki 33 saal kii umr main bhi unka jalawaa kaayam he
 Even before the final match, Novak Djokovic has secured his number one ranking, yet Federer will go down with the intention of winning the title
 federer record nauveen baar atipi world tour finels ke khitaabi mukaable main pahunche hai or chah baar to vah champion banane main bhi kaamyaab rahe hai
 It remains to be seen whether Djokovic is able to prevent Federer from winning a record seventh ATP World Tour Finals title in the final

 com / 5l8spaijgw Gajendra Singh gave enough spice to the political fraternity to leave his eyes
 beshak, naaraazgi or kshobh vaazib he lekin isaki vajahen galat hai
 Gajendra Singh, a middle-aged middleman of a tenant family in Dausa district of Rajasthan, swung from a tree during Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's Kisan rally at Delhi's Jantar Mantar on April 22
 unki khudakushi ko fouran vipakshi dalon ne narendra modi sarkaar ke bhoomi adhigrahan adhyadesh ke khilaaf morcha kholane kaa bahaanaa bana liya or ve is kanoon ko gajendra singh or desh main baaki kisaanon kii maut kii vajah bataane lage
 However, the deepening of the agricultural crisis or the suicides of the farmers due to the land acquisition only seems to be related
 yahi nahin, rashtriya aparaadh record beuro ke aankadon ke mutabik, 2013 tak ke das saal main khudakushi ke maamalon main teji se giravat hi dekhne ko mili he (dekhen grophics)
 But the leaders are probably giving wrong examples to justify their point
 sansad ke donon sadanon main chali bahes main jor sirf sankat ke kaamchalaoo samaadhaan par tha or un gahare dhanchaagat muddon kii upeksha kar di gai jinke liye rajnatik samaadhaan kii jarurat he
 It is not that the agrarian crisis is not an issue, but that the crisis is very big
 2011 kii janaganana ke aakalnon ke mutabik desh ke kul 24
 16 in 7 crore families
 8 karod parivaar gramin ilaakon main hai
 In 2013, according to the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) 70th round of "situational Assessment Survey of Agro Based Households"
 8 karod pariwaron main sirf 9
 Only 2 crore producers are engaged in agricultural activities
 lekin samasya yahi nahin he
 The survey shows that small or marginal farmers who cultivate land up to 2 hectares are not able to compensate even their average monthly expenses from agricultural (farming and animal husbandry) income
 survey kahata he ki in 9
 7 out of 02 crore tenant families
 81 karod (yani 86
 6 per cent) are unable to earn enough from agriculture to meet their expenses
 yahi darasal samasya kii asli jad he
 Declining fields: Most tenant families earn extra from employment or jobs in non-agricultural areas to meet their expenses
 lekin surveykshan ke mutabik, ek hectare se kam jameen vaale 6
 For 26 crore families, that is, seventy percent of the total agricultural households, even that extra income is not enough
 darasal is surveykshan se andaja miltaa he ki chunauti kitni badi he
 The survey also shows that only households with more than 2 hectares of farming are able to earn more than their monthly expenses
 isse yahi pataa chalata he ki badi jot hi kheti ke liye kamau vikalp he
 According to a NABARD study in February last year, the average size of cultivated land has been reduced by half in the last 40 years - 2 in 1970-71
 28 hectare se kam hokar 2010-11 main 1
 16 hectares
 natijatan is avadhi main seemaant va choti joton kii sankhya main kramshah 5
 6 crores and 1
 1 karod kii vruddhi ho gai
 nabard's assessment of the small holdings not being suitable is confirmed by the results of the NSSO made public in December 2014, stating that farms larger than 2 hectares are capable of earning more than the farmer's consumption expenditure
 
 lihaaja, samaadhaan yahi he ki jameen ke chote tukade par roak lagaai jaae or kheton kaa aakaar bada rakhaa jaae
 The political class will have to consider this
 pramukh krishi arthshaastri vaai
 K
 alagh kaa kahana he, ''kisaanon ke samuhik kheti ke liye ekajute hone se hi iskaa samaadhaan nikalegaa
 Not on the lines of the Soviet Union but in the shape of productive companies
 iske liye ek simit str kaa sahyog jaruri hoga jisamen kisi kisaan ko apni jameen nahin deni hogi balki use laagat kii kharid or utpaada kii bikri main sahyog lenaa-dena hoga
 Ramesh Chand, director of the National Agricultural Economics and Policy Research Institute (NCAP), has suggested a regulatory framework to facilitate the leasing of agricultural land legally to determine farmers' safety and stability
 desh ke jameen lij sambandhi kanoon aazaadee ke vakt kii sthitiyon ke hisaab se bane hue hai
 Due to this, many farmers are not willing to lease their land
 ramesh chand kehete hai, ''yaa phir jo khet lij par lenaa chaahate hai, unhen milte nahin
 Farmers, for fear of losing control of the land, prefer to let it remain idle instead of leasing it
 ʼʼrajnatik birdari ke liye chunauti bhu-joton ke or tukade hone se rokane kii he jisase kheti phaayde kii nahin rah jaati
 Agricultural administrators are recommending a system of forced / informal leasing / renting of agricultural land, advocating a regulatory framework to protect landowners and prevent land holdings from getting smaller
 beemaa kii gahamagahamiagar is baar kii sardiyaan kisaanon ke liye takalifdeh raheen or vasant bhi unke liye bahaar lekar nahin aayaa, to bemausam barish or olavrishti ne rabi kii kul 606 lakh hectare kii fasal main kareeb 189 lakh hectare fasal ko barabaad kar diya
 This led to two demands
 ek, rajya sarkaron ne kendriya sahaayta kii maang kii
 Secondly, farmers demanded relaxation in procurement standards so that their spoiled crop also gets market
 ummid ke mutabik rajnatik halake se joardaar awaajen uthih sansad main sattarudh endie ke saansad raahat vitaran maanakon main chhot dene ke centre ke anurodh kaa dhol peetate rahe to vipakshi dal rajyon ko turant zyada sahaayta uplabdh karaane main centre sarkaar kii naakaami par use gherne kii koshish main lage rahe
 In this political tug of war, the fine difference between relief and compensation is lost somewhere
 desh ke netaaon ke liye sabakah fasal kharaab ho jaae to centre sarkaar raahat pradaan karti he lekin samay kii jarurat yah he ki fasalon kaa beemaa kiya jaae
 Even the central government has acknowledged that the results of the NSSO survey indicate that a very small proportion of agricultural households use crop insurance
 is sthiti se nibatane ke liye ensiapi ke ramesh chand kisaanon ko is bare main jaagruk karne par jor dete hai ki muaavje kaa paatr banane ke liye unhen beemaa kii laagat deni chahie
 In this also the government can give subsidy on the premium of marginal farmers
 haalanki alagh kisaanon kii lallo-chappo karne se bhi chetate hai
 "you cannot destroy insurance companies by forcing them to reduce premiums," he says
 ʼʼ haalanki ve seemaant kisaanon ke liye fasal beemaa premium main sabsidi dene kii sarkaar kii bhoomika ko sweekaar bhi karte hai
 Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh has indicated that a strong crop insurance system is needed which was started by Rajnath Singh as the Minister of Agriculture in the previous NDA government
 bazaar se lo, bazaar ko dofasal acchhee ho jaae or uski kataai bhi ho jaae to bhi kisaan kii sari mushkilen khatm nahin ho jaatin
 After that, another painful journey actually begins
 aap mahaj ganga ke maidan main purv kii ore chale jaaen to aapako uttar pradesh, bihar or pashchim bengal ke kisaanon kii shikaayatein sunne ko mil jaaengi ki unke utpaada yaa to bik nahin rahe hai yaa phir unhen sarkaar kii ore se tay nunatam samarthan mulya se kam par bechnaa pad rahaa he
 Former agriculture secretary Ashish Bahuguna says that agricultural holdings in eastern India are so small that transportation is too expensive for farmers to take crops to procurement centers
 isse vahaan ke vyapaariyon ko mandi (thok) kii jagah khet se hi utpaada kharidne kaa mauka mil jaataa he or ve aksar yah kharid nunatam samarthan mulya (emspi) se kam par karte hai
 The political leadership of the original Green Revolution states - Punjab and Haryana, has institutionalized their procurement network, but elsewhere, especially the political leadership of the Gangetic plain, the Chief Ministers of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh respectively, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Raman Singh Lessons to be learned from in donon mukhyamantriyon ne gehun (madhya pradesh) or dhan (chhattisgarh) ke kisaanon ke liye ek majboot kharid network khadaa karne kii disha main lagaataar kaaphi kaam kiya he jisase unhen fasalon kii acchhee keemat mil jaati he
 In fact, Ramesh Chand warns against relying solely on the government for procurement and points to the role of the private sector
 unka kahana he ki emspi jaise sansthagat dakhal ke alaava jor kharidaaron main pratispardhaa badhaane par bhi hona chahie
 The existing laws are also not helpful in this direction

 When it comes to taking credit for the country's agricultural tradition, the whole political section may come forward, but in reality most farmers continue to struggle for basic needs such as seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, electricity and loans
 pichley saal hi urvarkon kii aapurti main vyapak rukaawat ai jiske chalate desh ke kai hisson main rajnatik gahamagahami bhi rahi

 kharif kii fasal ke liye urvarkon kii jarurat pichley rabi mausam ke ant main puri ho jaani chahie
 Ajay Veer Jakhar, chairman of the Bharat Krishak Samaj, says, "the political class should focus on estimating the potential demand instead of reacting to the crisis arising out of its own misrule
" rajnatik dabaav rahegaa to order dene, urvarkon kaa sanchaalan sunishchit karne or unke samay par vitaran karne main talmail sthapit kiya ja sakegaa
 The political class should also take lessons from state governments like Shivraj Singh Chauhan in increasing the scope of irrigation for the benefit of farmers

 Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan met Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar at his Delhi residence on September 24
 baatcheet main pavaar ne apane bhattije ajit pavaar ke khilaaf media main ai khabaron kii ore ishaara kiya, jo rajya main up-mukhyamantri bhi hai
 The gesture was clear: Pawar was assuming that Chavan had leaked the news in the media
 chavaan ne bhi ise halake main hi liya or jawaab diya ki soochna ke adhikaar ke daur main kuch bhi gopneey nahin he
 Within 24 hours, when Chavan was at the Mumbai airport to go to Pune, a letter arrived in his office which was written by his Principal Secretary A
K
 ke
 Jain got it
 yah ajit pavaar kaa istipha tha
 An hour later, the remaining 19 NCP ministers in the state government also submitted their resignations not to Chavan but to NCP state unit president Madhukar Pichad
 ek din baad sarkaar kaa samarthan karne vaale 16 nirdaleey vidhayakon ne saaf kaha ki ve samarthan tabhi jari rakhenge jab ajit pavaar cabinet main rahenge
 It was obvious who was behind it
 yah khel sharad pavaar to nishchit hi nahin khel rahe the
 At a press conference in the Mumbai-based ministry soon after his resignation, Ajit Pawar said that he had resigned so that crores of rupees were paid
 ke sinchai ghotaale main apane khilaaf chal rahi jaanch ko ve prabhavit na kar paaen
 He is accused of being the Minister of Water Resources between 1999 and 2009 to the tune of 20,000 crores
 kii sinchai pariyojnaayen manjuur karne main unhone aniyamitataayen barti thim or niyamon ko tod-marodakar in pariyojnaon ke tender vidarbha sinchai vikaas parishad kii prashaskeey ikai se anivaary manjuuri mili bagaiyr jari kar die the
 In May this year, the Chief Minister announced that he would bring a white paper on the scam which would demand an inquiry into the period when Ajit Pawar was a minister
 ajit pavaar par aarope se jude dastavej jab ek rashtriya dainik ko chuninda taur par li kiye gaye to ve or bhadak gaye
 NCP activists blamed the Chief Minister's Office for this
 ajit pavaar ne kaha ki unke faisle kanoonee daayre main the
 He told reporters in the ministry, "I don't believe in staking files
" isliye maine vipakshi dalon kii maang par pariyojnaon ko hari jhandi de di
 The Minister has special powers to approve projects on behalf of the Governor
 ’’ ajit pavaar ne kaha ki ve istipha tab tak waapas nahin lenge jab tak ki shwet patr jari nahin ho jaataa or un par lage aarope dhul nahin jate
 Though the investigation has been going on for the last four months, then the question arises that why did Ajit Pawar take so long to break the relationship with his alliance partner? One reason is that his resignation is as big a challenge for the Congress as it is for his uncle Sharad Pawar
 jab se sharad pavaar ne sanket dena shuru kiya ki unki siyaasi uttaradhikari unki beti supriya sule hongi, tabhi se ajit pavaar party par apane varchasv ko kaayam karne main lag gaye the jisamen kuch had tak unhen kamyaabi bhi mili
 Of the 62 NCP mlas, 50 have faith not with Sharad Pawar but with Ajit
 shaayad yahi sochakar sharad pavaar apni bitiyaa ko dilli laae or uske liye apni pasandida baraamati loksabhaa seat bhi tyaag di
 "the area of the two is always divided," says an NCP MP
 supriya centre main hai or ajit rajya main
 In June this year, Sharad Pawar formed the Nationalist Youth Congress, the official women's unit of the NCP, headed by Supriya
 sule ne iske binar tale rajya kii kai loksabhaa siton par reliyaan kar jamini str par pahunchane kii koshish kii
 Says a Congress MLA from the state, "at the time of its formation, Sharad Pawar spoke about the power of women like Mayawati
 isse laga jaise ve ajit ke vikalp ke taur par supriya ko pramot kar rahe hai
 This became clear when Sharad Pawar vacated the chair of the President of the Yashwantrao Chavan Pratishthan Trust for Batiya on 21 September
 ajit pavaar haalanki on da record yahi kehete hai, ‘‘pavaar banaam pavaar media kaa gadha hua he
 We have given full authority to take the final decision to Saheb (sharad Pawar)
 koi matbhed nahin he
 "sule is the first to rein in such speculation
" ve ajit pavaar ko dada kahati hai
 He claims that they both talk daily
 yah poochne par ki unke bich kya baaten hoti hai, unhone kaha, ‘‘yah bhai-bahan ke bich kii baatcheet he
 You do not need to know this
 ’’in chachere bhai-bahanon main jameen-aasmaan kaa fark he
 Charming Sule, who wears fabulous costumes, is not averse to publicity
 ve apni chhavi sarokaari mahila kii bana rahi hai jisaki chintaa ke centre main mahila adhikaar, shiksha or kuposhan hai
 Sule, who looks beautiful on TV, is seen by the media as favoring the NCP on various issues these days
 unke thik ulat 53 saal ke ajit kii maujuudagi bhi pataa nahin chalati
 Before joining politics, he used to watch the family business of milk and poultry
 unki baatcheet lathmaar hoti he
 After becoming the Deputy Chief Minister in 2010, he also started trying to learn English, but soon gave up
 in bhai-bahan ke bich koi sidhaa matbhed nahin he
 In 2009, when the Congress made Ashok Chavan as the Chief Minister, Sharad Pawar had chosen Chhagan Bhujbal on behalf of the NCP for the candidature of the Deputy Chief Minister, ignoring nephew Ajit
 2010 main congress ne jab ashok chavaan kii jagah prithviraj chavaan ko laayaa tab ajit ne vidhayakon ke samarthan se apni takat dikhaai or sharad pavaar ko apni ummidavaari ke liye raji kar liya
 Not giving much importance to the collective resignations of NCP ministers, Sharad Pawar told the media, "in such a situation my party workers would have done the same for me
 ’’ unhone yah bhi kaha ki rajya sarkaar shsthirya he
 However, the drama of mass resignation, Ajit Pawar has made it clear that no matter how much his uncle may claim the government is stable, it is not so
 sharad pavaar ne prithviraj ko kaha he ki ve ajit kaa istipha manjuur kar len
 He has acknowledged the power of Ajit Pawar by saying that the NCP will no longer field his candidate for the post of Deputy Chief Minister
 abhi tak ajit pavaar ne ensipi ke vidhayak dal se istipha nahin diya he
 He has also put forward two names for the two ministries-finance and Energy vacated by his resignation
 yah ahm baat he kyonki mantripad baantne kaa kaam sharad pavaar ke adhikaar kshetra main aata he
 Party sources say in a gesture that Ajit is frustrated with the NCP revolt against the Congress in the recent past
 dhyaan rahe ki is saal agast main sharad pavaar or prafull patel ne kendriya cabinet se yah kehete hue istipha de diya tha ki maharashtra or dilli donon hi jagah congress ne unke saath kharaab vyavhaar kiya he
 Ajit was taking advantage of this situation and was constantly pressurizing to change the Chief Minister, but Sharad Pawar did not allow his demand to reach a logical conclusion
 ajit ko ummid thi ki lambit cabinet pherbadal ke chakkar main chavaan ko dilli bula liya jayega, lekin 24 sitambar ko apni dilli yatra main chavaan ne sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kar unka aashirwad le liya ki unki kursi surakshit rahegi
 Ajit Pawar hoped that with his political aggression he would overcome the gentleman Prithviraj, but he proved to be wrong
 chavaan ke upar 10 janpath kaa haath he or usee kii takat thi ki ve apane up-mukhyamantri par hi chadh baithe
 In September 2011, he hurt Ajit's sources of earning money by appointing administrators in Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank
 isse bainkon ke fund kaa niyantran ajit pavaar ke haath se nikal gaya
 Ajit has now hit back
 sharad pavaar or chavaan donon jaanate hai ki ajit ke paas itani takat he ki in donon ke haathon se rajya kii lagaam sarak sakati he
 Now everyone is waiting for the white paper
 kendriya mantriravishankar prasadne arthvyavastha ke kharaab halaat par teen filmon kaa udhaaharan diya tha
 He had said that the three films released on October 2 have done business of 120 crores
 ab desh main iconomi dhimi he tabhi to itnaa bijness aa rahaa he
 Ravi Shankar said this with the help of figures from the film trade analyst Komal Nahata
 komal nahata se jab is bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki film industry bhartiya arthvyavastha main sahyog nahin karti he
 Speaking to India Today, Komal Nahata said, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad was absolutely right in terms of earning of films and this is the first time that films have earned 120 crores in a day
 nahata ne kaha ki tathyaatmak to ravishankar prasad bilkul thik the
 This is the first time that the film industry earned 120 crores rupees a day
 isse pehle bahubali 2 ke samay par hua tha jab 112 karod kii kamai ek din main hui thi
 When Komal Nahata was asked about the economy of the film industry, she said, the film industry and Bollywood both contribute very little to the economy
 shaayad ek yaa do pratishat
 The film industry is very glamorous among the people, but it is just the attraction
 komal nahata ne kaha ki film industry arthvyavastha main koi zyada sahyog nahin karti he
 Nahata said that Ravi Shankar Prasad's statement may have been distorted
 ravishankar ne bayaan wapasaliyaravishankar prasad ne apni safai dete hue kaha tha ki meraa bayaan tathyaatmak rup se sahi he, maine ye bayaan diya tha, kyonki main mumbai main tha, mujhe apane film industry par garv he jisase lakhon logon ko rojgaar miltaa he or ye log tex ke rup main desh ke vikaas main yogadan dete hai
 Ravi Shankar Prasad had said, "the entire video of my conversation is on social media, yet i am sorry to know that a part of my statement was distorted, being a sensitive person, i revert to my statement Take it " Describing the budget presented today by Railway Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal as balanced, principled, affordable and comfortable to travel, the government said that the aspirations of the common man have been taken special care in the railway budget

 Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday warned Pakistanis not to go to Kashmir for jihad as it would harm Kashmiris
 khan ne kaha, ‘yadi pakistan se koi jihad ke liye bharat jayega
 
 
 So he will be the first person to do injustice to Kashmiris, he will be an enemy of Kashmiris
 ' khan ne daawa kiya ki bharat ko kashmir ke logon par karrwai karne ke liye mahaj ek bahaane kii jarurat he
 Khan said this after inaugurating the Torkham Terminal on the pakistan-afghanistan border
 unhone ek baar phir se daawa kiya ki bharat kashmir se dhyaan bhatakaane ke liye ‘falls flag' (jhootha aarope laga kar koi) abhiyaan shuru kar saktaa he
 Prior to Khan's important visit to the US, this statement came from his discouraging jihadist activities in Kashmir
 apni is yatra ke dauraan vah sanyukt raashtra mahasabha ko sambodhit karenge or america raashtrapati donald trump se milenge
 Khan said that he would raise the Kashmir issue so strongly in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) session next week as never before
 radio pakistan kii khabar ke mutabik khan ne kaha ki bharat ke saath vaarta tab tak nahin ho sakati, jab tak ki vah (nayi dilli) kashmir main karfu nahin hataa letaa he or anuchhed 370 hataane ke apane faisle ko radd nahin kar detaa he
 a proposed visit by some political parties and religious parties towards the Line of Control was postponed earlier this week
 darasal, khan ne unase kaha tha ki 27 sitambar ko sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main unke sambodhan tak ise taal diya jaae
 Significantly, tensions between India and Pakistan increased after most of the provisions of Article 370 giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir were repealed by India on August 5
 kashmir par nayi dilli ke kadam par pratikriya karte hue pakistan ne bharat ke saath rajanyik sambandhon kaa darja kam kar diya or bhartiya ucchayukta ko nishkasit kar diya
 Khan also claimed that the attack on a Hindu temple at Ghotki in Sindh province was a conspiracy to disrupt his UN General Assembly address
 unhone kaha, ‘ghotki main jo kuch hua uski main ninda karata hum
 On the subject of Afghanistan, Khan said that Pakistan will do its utmost to restore the stalled peace process with this neighboring country (afghanistan)
 pradhanmantri khan ne kaha ki vah america raashtrapati donald trump ke saath somvaar ko neuyark main apni baithak ke dauraan shanti prakriya behaal karne par jor denge
 He said it would be a tragedy if the talks do not resume and the Taliban do not participate in the Afghan elections
 darasal, kuch din pehle trump ne kaha tha ki taliban ke saath vaarta band ho gai he
 After this, this statement of Khan has come

 The death of 22-year-old Arvind Kumar, 45-year-old Bashir Ahmed and 50-year-old Lasa Khande in the communal violence that erupted on Eid morning in Kishtwar, desperate to fire, has threatened to eradicate the last traces of a polytheistic society in Jammu and Kashmir

 Chidambaram assured Parliament on 12 August that efforts to forcefully displace people after the 9 August riots would be thwarted
 lekin 1990 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main ghati se kareeb 4 lakh panditon ke palaayan kii tarah badi sankhya main pariwaron ke palaayan kii ashanka ek vaastavik khatra ban chuki he
 On August 13, four days after the latest and most horrific incident of bloodshed and arson in this beautiful town nestled in the lap of the Himalayas on the banks of the Chenab River, 238 km from Jammu, Hindu residents expressed the exact same fear
 kishtwar vyapaaree sangh ke adhyaksh 38 varsh ke rakesh gupta kaa kahana tha ki agar abdulla sarkaar se muaavje yaa suraksha kii pakki guarantee nahin mili to “hamaare liye yahaan se jane ke sivaay koi vikalp nahin hoga
 Gupta's shop Rakesh Cloth House on Shaheedi Road was looted to ashes after being looted

 Kishtwar is situated around this grassy field of Chaugan, spread over 165 acres
 is paagalpan ko apni ankhon se dekhne vaale 53 varshiya vyapaaree balbir singh kaa kahana he ki har koi marane-maarane par utaaru tha
 Immediately after the debate, kick-punches started and Muslims going for Namaz broke into Hindu shops and business places with stones and petrol bombs
 is sampradayik jhagade main saaf taur par ek paksh ke saath khadey rajput balbir singh ne mana, “hinduon ne bhi jawaab dene main der nahin kii
 As soon as the Namaz was over, the crowd broke out at Chaugan
 unhone vahaan darjanon kaaren tod deen or petrol pump se luute gaye petrol or dijal se chaugaan ke chaaron taraf musalamaanon kii dukaanon main aag laga di
 After that the fighting continued for eight hours
 gusse se ufanti bheed ne chaugaan main ek-duusare par patharav kiya
 At the southern end, the Muslims were trying to save the tomb of the Kishtwar saint, Shah Asraruddin Baghdadi, the small Jirat, and the crowd of Hindus stood in front
 hinsa tab or bhadak uthi jab pehle ek berozegaar noujvaan arvind kumaar shotgan ke chharron se dher ho gaya or uske kuch ghante baad jan swasthya vibhaag ke karmchaaree bashir ahamed kii laash mili, jise jalaakar maar diya gaya tha
 During this period, karinde-kishtwar MLA of the local government and Minister of State for Home Affairs Sajjad Kichlu, Deputy Commissioner Chaudhary Salim Mohammed and Senior Superintendent of Police Sunil Gupta watched the helpless spectacle
 ve chaugaan ke ek chor par kishtwar ke vishaal sarkari dak bangale ke bheetar police or sashastr seemaa bal ke pehre main the
 Balbir Singh said, "ashamed Kichlu went quietly along with Ashok Prasad, Director General of Police (DGP) of Jammu and Kashmir
 ”saleem or gupta, donon kaa laaparvaahee baratane ke aarope main tabadalaa kar diya gaya
 Kichlu remained hidden in his house in the city and then on August 11, Chief Minister Omar Abdullah called him to Jammu
 un par aarope lage ki unhone hinsa rokane ke liye sena kii kumuk bulaane main jaan-boojhkar deree kii
 On August 12, he was forced to resign
 sarkaar ne hycourt ke ek ritred jaj se jaanch karaane kaa aadesh diya he
 The reason for Kichloo being innocent seems to be hollow because the first shop named Mahajan Boot House was burnt down, less than 20 meters from the post bungalow
 38 saal ke ek dukandaar preetam gupta ne bataaya, “kichalu ne jarur dekha hoga ki dangaiyon ne kitni fursat se meri dukaan kaa shater todaa, or aag lagane se pehle jo kuch lut sake, lut liya
 DC kept assuring that 'stop, I'm calling the army
 ’ meri dukaan raakh hone ke chaar ghante baad ek damakal ko bheja
 The troops arrived very late in the evening
 ”rashtriya rifl kii teen tukdiiyon—11 aaraar, 8 aaraar or 17 aaraar—ko jab tak dilli se aadesh mili or 9 agast ko shaam 7 baje ke baad jab tak unhone morcha sambhala, tab tak kishtwar dhundhuna ho chukaa tha
 More than 100 shops and an equal number of private cars and other vehicles were destroyed
 chaar din baad dak bangale se malik market or shahidi chowk ke raste shahidi road ke thane vaale chor tak 600 meter ke faasale main shahar bhutaha lag rahaa tha
 Smoke was still rising from the burnt shops
 sampradayik bhaawanaaon se uttejit samooche jammu kshetra main tab tak kaphryu se koi nijaat nahin thi
 Ignoring the warnings, despite all the bells of danger, Kishtwar is cautious, questioning the government's hyped-up intent, "an analyst says," Jammu and Kashmir is a very small place
 yahaan har kisi ko yah pataa hota he ki kisi ke dinar main kya pak rahaa he
 "he says," 10 days before Eid, Kishtwar was the most discussed subject in Srinagar
 har kisi ko yah pataa tha ki baari musiibat aane hi vaali he
 Balbir Singh says that tension erupted in this communally sensitive town only in February this year when Afzal Guru was hanged
 ve kehete hai, “faansee kii sajaa kaa virodh kar rahe musalmaan hindu dukandaaron ko baar-baar apni dukaane band karne ke liye majaboor kar rahe the
 Unconfirmed rumors of Muslim girls running away with Hindu boys have added fuel to the fire of this growing hostility
 uske baad july main ek baari takaraav tab sulagta hua dikhaai padaa jab kishtwar se 12 kilometre dur sthit sangrambaata gaanv main kalash yatra (murti sthapit karne ke purv nikaala jane vaala dharmik juluus) ke saath chal rahe yuvakon ne ek musalmaan noujvaan ko peet diya
 However, the police persuaded the procession to go through another route and averted a major confrontation
 25 july ke baad pani sir ke upar aa gaya
 a 15-year-old Muslim girl from Bhankote village accused four Hindu boys of raping her
 uske baad musalmaan bastiyon main nakaabposhon ke mahilaon ke saath balaatkaar or gharon main lutpaat karne kii kai khabaren ain
 Just two days before Eid, another problem arose
 police ne un postaron ko hataane ke liye kai sthaneey masjidon main pravesh kiya jisamen hurriyat netaa shabbir shah ko afjal guru or makabool bhatta ke saath dikhaaya gaya tha
 Those posters appealed to Muslims to take to the streets
 balbir singh kehete hai, “kuch bahut bura hona hi tha
 And the same thing happened
 ”siyasat kaa khelmusalmaan bahul ghati or hindu bahul jammu kshetra ke vibhaajan ko or gadha karnaa kashmiri siyasat kii ek lambii parampara rahi he
 The incidents of Kishtwar, with a population of 60-40 Muslims and Hindus in the city as well as the entire district, are apparently a part of the same plan on which the politics of the state runs
 aitihaasik rup se kishtwar ke log mail-milaap kii paramparaon kaa paalan karte the jisamen gramin kshetron main masjiden or hinduon ke mandir agal-bagal hua karte the
 For example Fariduddin Baghdadi and his son Asaruddin used to visit the dargahs for years, both Hindus and Muslims, for Jiyarat
