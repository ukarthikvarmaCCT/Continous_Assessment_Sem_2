 (agenciyon se input) (input from agencies) sansad satr shuru hone se thik ek din pehle loksabhaa spikar ne sarvadaleey baithak kii, jiske turant baad hi ye saaf ho gaya ki, sansad kii shuruyaat hangaamen se hogi or masalaa hoga uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan kaa
 The matter of Uttarakhand is presently in court, while supporting the Congress, RJD, NCP, JDU, Left told the speaker that firstly, President's rule in Uttarakhand should be discussed
 congress netaa mallikarjun khadge ne kaha ki, ek taraf samvidhan or uske nirmaataa ambedkar kii 125veen jayanti mani or duusari taraf arunanchal ke baad uttarakhand main loktantr kii hatya kii gai, ham is sabhi kaam roak kar sadan main charchaa chaahate hai
 After the meeting, on behalf of the government, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Rajiv Pratap Rudy clearly said that, the speaker will make the decision, but Uttarakhand case is currently going on in the court, hearing is on 27 April, so it is not right to discuss the issue right now 
 sarkaar ke is bayaan ke baad spikar ne bhi saaf kaha ki, maamla adaalat chal rahaa he, aise main charchaa karana sambhav nahin he
 Then what was there
 
 It has almost been decided that there will be a lot of uproar in the Lok Sabha and the opposition will be able to stop working
 vidhansabha chunaav ke chalate tiemasi, ediemke or diemke kaa koi netaa baithak main maujuud nahin tha
 However, the government is eyeing parties such as TMC, AIAMK and BJD, who can cross the border on the spot
 congress samet baaki vipakshi dalon ne sookhaa, jalsankat, kisaanon kii samasya, manhagaai or ganga kii safai kaa mudda uthaaya or charchaa kii maang kii
 RJD MP JP Yadav once again advocated a discussion on the issue of special state status to Bihar
 od-ivan kaa masalaa bhi uthavaise is baithak main dilli main od-ivan kaa masalaa bhi uthaa, tiares saansad jitendra kumaar reddy ne kaha ki, zyaadaatar saasand baahar se aate hai or dilli main unke paas ek hi gaadi he, steekar kii bhi samasya hogi, kyonki saasandon ko sansad satr ke dauraan sansad ke saath saath tamaam baithkon ke liye sansad aana janaa hota he
 Therefore, the car with stickers should be exempted from the ad-evan, which was supported by many leaders, but the BJD MP Bhartarihari Mehtab openly opposed the proposal
 haalanki baad main spikar ne kaha ki, wo vaikalpik vyavastha ke liye sansad ke trasamport vibhaag se baat karengi, jisase pheri kii gandiyon kii sankhya badhaai ja sake
 Although after listening to all these issues, the government says that it is ready to discuss all the issues, but the real screw is stuck on the discussion on President's rule in Uttarakhand, where both the government and a large section of the opposition are different
 Standing at different ends
 sarkaar bhale hi sankhya bal ke dam par loksabhaa main vidhaayi kaam-kaaj karaane main safal rahe, lekin uske saamne asli chunauti rajyasabha main he, jahaan sankhyabal main vipaksh baari he
 Anyway, during the winter session of Parliament, the Congress and the opposition parties had almost blocked the functioning of the House to a large extent in the Rajya Sabha, but due to the image concern among the public, in the first part of the budget session, the Opposition government to a large extent Had collaborated
 isi bich pehle arunanchal or phir uttarakhand main hui siyaasi halchal ne mukhya vipakshi dal congress ko ek baar phir hamalavar hone kaa mauka de diya he
 On the other hand, the Congress realizes that to counter it, the ruling party has already turned its cannon towards Sonia and Rahul on the Ishrat Jahan issue
 isiilie aanan-fanan main congress ne mallikarjun khadge, kapil sibbal or abhishek manu singhvi ko satr shuru hone se thik ek din pehle media se mukhaatib karaayaa, jisamen purv mantri kapil sibbal ne doharaaya ki, ishrat jahaan aatanki thi yaa nahin ye to adaalat tay karegi, lekin uskaa incounter hua ye to abhi tak saamne aayaa he
 But the government wants to divert attention from this issue, despite the filing of the charge sheet, its trial has not started yet
 congress ne maang kii ki jaldi hi is maamle trial shuru ho
 Also, citing the facts of the charge sheet, the Congress said that, PM Modi and Amit Shah will also be summoned when the trial starts in this case, that is why the trial has not started yet, after all the government and CBI are the same
 vahiin is mudde par sarkaar kii taraf se rajeev pratap rudi ne jawaab diya ki, congress aatankiyon or aatank ko lekar udaar rukh ankhti rahi he
 In such a situation, political weapons have been sharpened to dominate each other in Parliament
 bas intjaar he somvaar se shuru hone ja rahe hangaamedaar satr ke pehle din kaa

 Bringing Modi equal to him and raising the slogan 'har-har Modi' is not only an insult to Mahadev but an insult to followers of the entire Hindu religion

 The second cabinet meeting of the Narendra Modi government concluded on Thursday
 pradhanmantri modi ne sarkaar ke liye 10 sutreey praathamiktaayen apni cabinet ko spasht kar di hai
 Know what it is 1
 The morale of bureaucrats: The officials should have the support of the government, so that they can implement the policies on the ground
 2
 Welcome to new suggestions: Whether officers or the public, all can give their opinion to make India a better India
 mantri fasebuk or twitor par logon kii raay maangen
 Officials should prepare the blueprint of their plan and contact the Prime Minister or their minister
 3
 Education, Health, Water, Road: If the basic needs are not met, how will the developed country become
 isliye sarkaar ko sabase pehle sabhi ko shiksha, har gaanv-mohalle-shahar ko swasth suvidha, saaf peyajal, kheton main pani or sugam yatayaat ke liye sadaken uplabdh karaani hongi
 4
 sarkaar main paardarshitaah karpshan puure desh ke liye chintaa kaa vishay he
 And its improvement should start from the top
 nai sarkaar kii har niti, har harakat puri tarah se paardarshee ho
 5
 antar mantralay talmail ke liye vyavasthaah ek mantralay kii file duusare mantralay main ataki rahati he
 As a result, development work ceases and charges begin
 ise dur karne ke liye tamaam mantralayon ke bich talmail kii ek nai vyavastha hogi
 6
 janata kaa vaada puraa karne ke liye systamah janadesh miltaa he janata se kuch vaayade karke
 It has to be decided that the promises made are fulfilled in a time bound manner
 iske liye lagaataar ghoshnaptr ke binduon ke aadhaar par ban rahi nitiyon or unke nateezon kaa moolyankan ho
 7
 arthvyavastha ko patari par laane kii koshishah desh kii ummiden badi hai or ye bad rahi hai
 If inflation will not come down, the means of employment will not increase, the health of GDP will not improve, then all this will change in despair
 policy ke level par sudhaar kar, pukhta nirnay kar or vikaas ke kaamon main teji laakar arthvyavastha ko patari par laayaa janaa he
 8
 sansadhano or nivesh ke liye riformah arthvyavastha ko patari par laane ke liye nivesh ko badhaava dena hoga
 The obstacles in its path will have to be removed
 iske saath hi sansadhano kii lut rokane, magar unke samuchit istemaal ke liye bhi nitiyon main sudhaar karnaa hoga
 9
 tay miyaad ke andar nitiyon par amalh yojanaayen banati hai or phir unke upar filon kaa dher lag jaataa he
 There is a need to set a time limit for every work and to ensure accountability
 corporate lahaze main kahen to samay par sahi delivery par jor
 10
 sarkari nitiyon main sthirataa or nirantaratah videshi niveshak hon yaa naukarshahi, sabko yahi dar rahata he ki pataa nahin kab sarkaar badal jaae yaa pataa nahin kab sarkaar kii niti yutern le le
 this is wrong
 sarkari niti na sirf spasht honi chahie, balki yah dirghakaalik or nirantarata liye honi chahie, taaki sabko vijan spasht ho
 Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi met the top leadership of the organization, including Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat
 unhone is baat se inkaar kiya ki 2014 ke aam chunaavon main unhen pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ke taur par pesh karne ke mudde par koi charchaa hui
 'no intervention of Sangh' Modi said in a conversation with reporters after the meeting at the Union Headquarters, 'sangh is not involved in such things
 ’ vah pradhanmantri ke ummidavaar ke taur par khud ko pesh kiye jane kii sambhaavna se jude sawaal kaa jawaab de rahe the
 The Chief Minister said, 'after a long time i came here to meet Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat, Sahasarakaryavah Bhagyaji Joshi and Suresh Soni and had a cordial discussion with them on various issues
 ’ disambar main vidhansabha chunaavon kaa saamana karne ja rahe modi vishesh vimaan se aae or baithak ke tatkaal baad chale gaye
 Modi's visit comes in the backdrop of 'don't make political sense' statement of BJP MP Ram Jethmalani
 jethmalani ne kaha tha ki loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye modi ko party kaa pradhanmantri kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya janaa chahie
 However, the BJP downplayed the importance of the meeting and called it a courtesy meeting which should not derive any 'political meaning'
 bijepi ne bataaya 'shishtachar mulaakaat'bijepi pravaktaa mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne dilli main kaha, ‘narendra modi yaa party ke anya varisht netaa shishtachar ke naate sangh netaaon se milte rahete hai
 This meeting should be viewed from this perspective and it would not be right to derive its political meaning or see it in a big way

 gauratlab he ki visphotak padaarth act ke tahat sandigdh vastuon kii jaanch kii suvidha upi main keval agra main hi uplabdh he
 Also, it has been mentioned that up's Principal Secretary (home) had instructed Upadhyay not to forward the Agra Lab report to anyone else
 bataa den ki kit ke dwaara spot par kiye test ko keval praathmik mana jaataa he or court ise sweekaar nahin karti he
 This is why a test in the main lab is necessary for confirmation

 Within a month, the BJP has lost two big leaders
 6 agast kii shaam purv videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ke nidhan se bijepi abhi ubar bhi nahin ai thi ki 24 agast ko purv vitt mantri arun jetali kaa nidhan ho gaya he
 The BJP may have reached the pinnacle of power today, but these two leaders of the BJP took over the party at a time when there was disappointment among the workers after the defeat in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 loksabhaa main vipaksh ke netaa ke taur par sushamaa swaraj or rajyasabha main arun jetali ne morcha sambhala tha
 After that, the two leaders did not let the Manmohan Singh government sit peacefully on issues like 2G to Commonwealth Games, inflation
 vipaksh main shandaar bhoomika nibhaane vaale in do netaaon ne tathyon or apni bhaashan kala ke dam par sansad main janata kii aawaaj bane
 The leaders of UPA-2, surrounded by scandals and scams, have been heavily influenced by these leaders from the road to the Parliament
 is dauraan khaas baat yah rahi he ki donon netaaon ne kabhi koi aisa bayaan nahin diya jo vipakshi dalon ke liye sirdard bana ho
 Both Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley were lawyers by profession and they used to face arguments in Parliament with big lawyers like Kapil Sibal, Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Ram Jethmalani
 in donon netaaon kaa rahanaa bijepi ke liye bhi badi chunauti he kyonki donon hi bauddhik str par bhi gambhir yoddha ke taur par jane jate the
 Whenever questions were raised on bjp's Hindutva politics, Sushma and Jaitley used to answer it
 khaas baat yah he ki donon hi netaa aresas kii prishthbhumi se nahin aate the
 While Sushma Swaraj came from socialist politics in BJP, Jaitley's thinking was liberal and progressive
 in donon netaaon kii party bijepi piem modi kii aguwai main bhale hi satta ke shikhar par ho, lekin unke saamne hataash ho chuke vipaksh kii kursiyon ko sushamaa or arun jetali jaise netaa jarur yaad aaenge

 gangrape kii shikaayat darj karwaane pahunchi peedita ko police ke behuda or sharmnaak sawaalon kii vajah se apni shikaayat waapas leni padi

 bhagyalakshmi ne likhaa tha ki, 'ye kisi film kii story nahin he
 After doing all the investigation, i am telling about the incident
 ek din ek mahila ne mujhe phone kiya
 She was crying wildly
 jab maine usase poocha ki wo koun he, to usne bas itnaa kaha ki main aapse milanaa chaahati hum
 Bhagyalakshmi further wrote, After some time a woman came to meet him
 mahila ne bhagyalakshmi ko apni aapbeetee bataate hue kaha ki uske pati ke doston ne uske sathgangrepakia
 When the victim reached a police station in Thrissur to file a gang rape complaint, instead of taking action against the accused, the victim was questioned and forced to withdraw the case
 peedita ke mutabik, police ke ek adhikari ne usase poocha ki aropiyon main se sabase zyada majaa kiske saath aayaa
 The victim said that the police kept him in the police station from morning to evening and asked embarrassing questions
 peedita ne kaha, police adhikariyon ke yah behuda sawaal rape se kahin zyada jakhm dene jaise the
 It is worth noting that after this post went viral on Bhagyalakshmi's Facebook
 vijayan ne maamle par sangyaan liya or peedita ko doshiyon par karrwai kaa bharosa dilaayaa
 However, during the press conference, the victim flatly refused to name the guilty police officers

 In such a situation, there is no need to give any permission or data on the use of the app

 naagarikta sanshodhan bill par sansad main satta or vipaksh main talavaarein khinchi hui hai
 The government is calling it an amendment done on humanitarian grounds and the opposition is calling this bill unconstitutional
 lekin is bill se afghanistan se bharat aaye hindu or sikh sharnaarthi behad khush hai or raahat kii saans le rahe hai aakhir hindustan ab unka aupchaarik vatan hone ja rahaa he
 Hitler should not be talked about in everything and when it comes to Hitler, it should not be taken as a joke
 beesvin sadi ke itihaas main usase kaufanaaq kuch nahin tha
 We know that it is not possible for everyone to know the tortures of Hitler
 agar aap jaanate to is vajah se bhi charchaa nahin karte ki kahin aisa na ho jaae or jab lagata ki aisa ho saktaa he usase kuch miltaa julata he to aap tivi ke saamne nahin baithe hote balki rokane ke liye kuch karte
 When the air pollution in Delhi was at its peak, the Supreme Court also used a gas chamber when it was knocked out
 bhale supreme kot kaa sandarbh yah nahin hoga lekin gas chember se itihaas ke ek aise adhyay kii yaad aati he ki kisi kii bhi ruh kaanp jaae
 Therefore, one must be careful while using words
 1940 kaa dashak tha
 Thousands of people were killed in a gas chamber in one day
 poland main aushavitz kaa naam suna hoga
 Germany was then occupied here
 vahiin kii tasviren hai
 Many gas chambers were built here where Jewish and political prisoners, old people with disabilities were taken, first stripped of clothes and bathed
 unhen ek chember main le jaaya jaataa tha, do minute main gas bhar jaati thi or saikadon log ek baar main mar jate the
 It is said that in these gas chambers, 2 million people could be killed in a year
 kaha jaataa he ki hitler kii germany main alag alag tareekon se 60 lakh yahudiyon ko maaraa gaya
 Apart from them, other people were also killed, whose number is said to be more than 10 million
 mujhe nahin pataa ki aap gas chember main jate hi selfi khinchaayenge yaa itihaas ke is sandarbh ko yaad rakhenge ki phir kabhi na ho
 So when it comes to Hitler's Germany on the pretext of the Citizenship Amendment Bill, you can not be careless if the example of a gas chamber is being given in the detention center being built in Assam Karnataka
 check kiijie ki kahin isaki aahat to nahin he or galat he to iskaa pratikaar bhi kiijie taaki iske zikr main laaparvaahee na ho
 The history of Germany, which is being discussed in the context of citizenship law, continues to search for the criminals of that period
 is aktubar 2019 kii khabar he
 Germany prosecuted a 93-year-old Bruno who served at the age of 17 in Hitler's SS Police Force
 bruno par 5000 logon kii hatya ke aarope lagaae gaye
 Not only this, in New York last year, a 95-year-old man was sent to Germany who was hiding in America
 to aap samajhie 95 saal kii umr tak aparaadhiyon kii talash hoti he

 Demonstrations pick up at the University of Assam in the evening and the slogans of CAB Cow Back are being raised

 sanyukt sansadeey samiti ke saamne khufia vibhaag ne soochna di thi ki bharat main hindu, sikh, isai, buddha or parsi mazahabon ke 31,313 log dharmik pratadna ke aadhaar par laang turm visa lekar rah rahe hai
 He has applied for citizenship
 is sandarbh main grahamantri amit shah kaa loksabhaa main diya gaya jawaab mahatvapurn he
 He has said that people who get long term visas will be given citizenship
 to kya yah hangaamaa 31000 logon ko lekar he? rajyasabha main amit shah ne kaha ki pehle yah hota tha ki jinka passport visa expire ho jaataa tha unhen avaidh pravasi mana jaataa tha
 But now if people of 6 religions expire passports, they will not be considered illegal migrants
 kya wo dharmik utpeedan yaa pratadna ko aadhaar banaakar yah kah rahe hai yaa dharm ke aadhaar par sabhi ko aam maafee de rahe hai
 You should listen to Amit Shah's statement carefully
 ve avaidh ghuspaithiye kii jagah avaidh pravasi kaa istamaal karne lage hai
 That is, the intruders have now migrated
 yah pramotion vaise acha he
 Not only this, you will hear that Amit Shah does not mention the refugee of Assam but Bengal
 kam se kam is jagah par
 They may have been missed, but the ruckus is happening in Assam, it is about Bengal
 amit shah jin tarikhon kaa hawala de rahe hai use lekar assam main bavaal ho rahaa he
 Assam protesters are still reading illegal migrants as illegal infiltrators and not distributing them on the basis of religion
 samjhaute ke tahat march 1971 ke baad jo bhi videshi aae hai unki pahchaan hogi or nikaale jaaenge
 Now this date is being changed
 pradarshnakariyon kaa kahana he ki bijepi ne hameshaa bharosa diya he ki assam samjhaute kii bhaavana se chhedchhad nahin hogi
 While answering all the questions, the Home Minister also responded to the concerns of Assam
 unhone kaha ki assam samjhaute ke cloj 6 ke liye assam ke logon ke liye cameti banaai he
 The Assam Accord will be fully implemented as soon as the report arrives
 amit shah ne kaha ki assam kii bhashaa sahitya or boliyon kii chintaa sarkaar karegi
 No one needs to doubt
 aapane suna ki grahamantri kah rahe hai ki kya pakistan ke muslaanon ko nagirakata de den lekin isi bhaashan main duusari jagah do baar bataate hai ki 5 saal main modi sarkaar ne 566 se adhik musalamaanon ko naagarikta di he
 He did not state which country 566 Muslims belonged to
 lekin rajyasabha main hi grih rajya mantri nityanand raay ne likhit jawaab main kaha ki 2016 se 2018 ke dauraan 1595 pakistani nagarikon ko bharat kii naagarikta di gai he
 He also said that 927 Sikhs and Hindus from Afghanistan and Pakistan have been given citizenship
 jab nagirakata dene kaa praavdhaan he to kya yah sawaal poocha ja saktaa he ki is kanoon kii zarurat kya thi? gulam nabi azaad ne kaha ki grahamantri kah rahe hai ki inaki sankhya karodon main he
 Ghulam Nabi Azad said that only 4000 refugees have applied for citizenship, so where are the number of crores coming from? kapil sibbal ne kaha ki bijepi ke log manmohan singh ke bayaan kaa hawala de rahe hai ki ki padosi deshon se pratadit hokar jo log aae hai unhen naagarikta di jaani chahie, lekin bijepi ke vaktaa usee bahes main adwani ke jawaab kaa zikr nahin karte jinhone kaha tha jo utpeedan ko lekar tarah tarah ke aarope lagate rahete hai, ham hameshaa kehete hai ki jo dharmik utpeedan se bhaag kar aae hai wo sharnaarthi hai lekin jo avaidh sharnaarthi hai wo avaidh hi hai
 During the debate, every speaker was referring to the history of his own accounts
 itihaas ke prati jigyaasa paidaa karata he lekin kya aapke paas vakt he vibhaajan ke vakt ke kisson ko padhane kaa lekin netaa is tarah se tathyon ko lekar khel jate hai ki aap awak rah jate honge
 One thing was understood while listening to the debate about this bill
 media kii kai report main padhane ko miltaa he ki bharat ke naagarik kai deshon main avaidh tareeke se ghus gaye or vahaan nagirakata paa gaye
 i think that such non resident Indians will be very happy with this bill, who went on illegal visa in USA or anywhere and now running hotels there
 acha kaam kar rahe hai
 This is the truth of the world
 rojgaar kii talash kisi ko kahin se bhi kahin le ja sakati he
 Throughout the debate, there has been talk of persecution of Hindus in Pakistan and Bangladesh
 lekin sarkaar kii taraf se koi nahin bataa sakaa ki kab is sawaal ko lekar un deshon se baat hui he
 Not only the government, the Congress leaders also did not tell what happened to Pakistan and Bangladesh during the time of their government
 dhaka tribune main bangladesh ke videsh mantri abdul momin kaa bayaan chapa he
 Bangladesh Foreign Minister Momin said that his country would study before talking to India in this matter
 bangladesh main minarity kii sthiti ko lekar amit shah ke bayaan ko sweekaar nahin karata he
 What is being said about the torture of Hindus is unfair and also wrong
 duniya main bahut kam aise desh hai jahaan bangladesh kii tarah sampradayik sauhaard he
 We do not have any minority here
 sab baraabar hai
 If Amit Shah had stayed in Bangladesh for a few months, he would have seen the harmony of our country
 unki apane desh main samasyaayein honge, unhen aapas main ladane dijie
 We are not worried
 ek dostana mulk ke naate ham ummid karte hai ki bharat aisa kuch nahin karegaa jisase rishton par fark aae
 Kapil Sibal and other mps raised the question which meant that 19 lakh people have given legacy documents during the National Register
 yani yah sabit kiya he ki ve bharat ke naagarik hai
 He has not said that he has come to India as a victim of religious persecution
 jab pehle nahin kaha to kaise sabit karenge ki dharmik utpeedan ke kaaran aae hai
 Home Minister Amit Shah has responded to this question of Sibal
 sibbal kaa sawaal tha ki kaise pahachaanenge ki koi dharmik utpeedan kaa shikaar hua he, amit shah ne kaha hamaare aankh kaan khule hai
 This bill is being opposed from place to place
 saansad bhale santusht na hue hon lekin jin saansadon ne sawaal kiya, amit shah ne sabhi kaa naam lekar unke sawaalon kaa jawaab diya
 He also took the name of those who did not participate in the discussion
 ho jaataa he kabhi kabhi
 History of the time of partition was mentioned
 aisa lag rahaa tha ki nehru or patel sansad ke saamne pesh kiye gaye hon or un donon se vibhaajan kaa sawaal na puch kar congress party se poocha ja rahaa he jaise us vakt vibhaajan kii baat jahaan ho rahi thi nehru or patel nahin the, congress party thi
 That is to say, the claims made about history are worrying
 aakhir aap apni jigyaasa kaise shant karenge
 There is no time nor information on what to read
 saavarkar ke bayaan kii charchaa hui amit shah ne kaha ki mujhe pataa nahin unhone kaha tha yaa nahin lekin main khandan nahin kar rahaa
 So in the same way, if need be, use history and if need be, leave it in the air
 behatar he itihaas kii chintaa aap netaaon se dur ghar main kitabon ke bich karen
 Otherwise politics will continue to benefit
 grahamantri amit shah ne kaha ki phir to duniya main jitne log hai sabko hamen naagarikta de deni chahie
 Which country has such a provision
 human ritis ke champiyan desh saare hai
 There, someone can get citizenship of Indian citizens
 de sakate hai kya he
 Now you will hear that the matter is correct but the fact is not the same
 tathy he ki aise bahut se desh hai jo paise lekar bhi naagarikta dete hai, jaise mehul chaukasee ne lee or anya aadhaar par bhi nagirakata dete hai
 During the debate on the Citizenship Amendment Bill, Amit Shah said that he is bringing NRC
 unhone khud kaha he ki lekar aaenge
 Have your documents ready
 jab ghar ghar main dastavezon kii khoj shuru hogi tab kya hoga, aap samaj sakate hai
 Nothing happens in the name of women
 wo kahaan se dastauez laaengi
 What will the Banjaras do? jo beghar hai wo kahaan se pramaan laaenge
 Still start preparing because Amit Shah has said that after this he is bringing NRC
 gauratlab he ki gurmeet ram rahim kii kareebi haniprit ko police ne isi hafte police ne giraftaar kiya he jise adaalat ne 6 din kii remand par bhej diya he
 The day before his arrest, Honeypreet clarified that wrong things were being told about her and Ram Rahim's relationship
 unka rishta beti or pita jaisaa he
 Significantly, Gurmeet Ram Rahim has been sentenced to 20 years rigorous imprisonment in the rape case along with two sadhus of the dera and is currently lodged in Rohtak jail
 25 agast ko unako adaalat ne doshi hone kaa elaan kiya tha us din unke samarthakon ne puure panchakula main jamkar utpaat machaaya tha
 In order to control them, the police were shot in which many people were killed

 After this, Honeypreet police continued to sneak up to Nepal for 38 days and finally they were caught from Punjab

 After this, Honeypreet police continued to sneak up to Nepal for 38 days and finally they were caught from Punjab
 'suhagaraat' shabd saamne aate hi yuvak-yuvatiyon ke dilodimag main tarah-tarah kii kalpanaaen udaan bharne lagati hai
 Teenagers do not cross, in every mind the thoughts associated with it begin
 is soch main kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Mistakes begin when some people pass on the eve of euphoria, which makes them deprive of joy in beautiful moments
 aage aisi 10 galatiyon kii charchaa kii gai he, jisase dur rahakar suhagaraat or aage ke daanpaty jivan main ras ghola ja saktaa he
 1
 bina partner kii sahmati ke sex na karendhiktar maamalon main log suhagaraat ko sex karnaa chaahate hai, par aisa jaruri nahin he ki usee raat sex sambandh kaayam kiya jaae
 Only when both agree to it, do so
 agar donon main se koi bhi kisi vajah se sex karne ke liye taiyaar na ho, to iske liye jor-jabardastee katai na karen
 2
 yon sambandh banane main hadabadi na dikhaaenam taur par suhagaraat se pehle yuvak-yuvatiyon ko ek-duusare ke sharir kii thik tarah se jaankaree nahin hoti he
 When they see an open body for the first time, they lose control and start hurting in this work
 is vajah se ve us sukh se vanchit rah jate hai, jisaki unhen darkaar hoti he
 Without foreplay, no girl is physically ready for a sexual act
 3
 Do not be afraid of the possibility of bleeding: Congestion, even if it is the first experience of sexual relations for a woman, bleeding is not necessary at all
 aam taur par Hymen (ek tarah kii jhilli) kisi anya shaareerik kaam ke dauraan pehle hi nasht ho gai hoti he, isliye raktasrav kii ashanka se darana galat he
 4
 apane jeevanasathi par shaq na karenkai baar log suhagaraat ko apane jeevanasathi ko shaq bhari nigahon se dekhte hai
 This makes the fun of those beautiful moments gritty, the foundation of the relationship also weakens

 On Tuesday, thousands of students studying in b group in science in 12th participated in the state's Common Entrance Test for admission in medical in Gujarat
 ye jaanate hue bhi ki supreme court ke nirnay ke mutabik is pariksha ke koi myne nahin
 The Supreme Court had made it clear on Monday through its order that only NEET will be valid for admission in medical
 mangalvaar ko phir bhi kareeb 67,000 chaatro ne rajya kii pariksha di sirf isi ummid par ki shaayad rajya sarkaar supreme court ke faisle ko chunauti de or is pariksha ko mahatv mili
 The comments aakhir gujarat board ke chaatro ko neet main safalataa kii ummid kam hi he kyonki gujarat board ke silebus main kareeb 30 pratishat antar he
 The children took the test, but this anger in their family became clear that their problem was not solved by the state government or by the order of the Supreme Court
 unhen lagata he ki do mahinon main hi 30 pratishat nayaa course padhanaa mushkil he
 He says that due to this the mental pressure increases in the students, they are feeling depressed

 After all, the students of Gujarat board have little chance of success in NEET as there is about 30 percent difference in syllabus of Gujarat board
 bacchon ne pariksha to di lekin unke parivaar main ye gussa saaf jhalka ki unki samasya na rajya sarkaar ne sulajhaai na supreme court ke aadesh se hi sulajhi
 He feels that in two months it is difficult to read 30 percent of the new course
 unka kahana he ki iske chalate chaatro main maansik dabaav bad jaataa he, depressd lagane lage hai
 In other states of the country including Maharashtra, where such examinations have been conducted, there is similar confusion among the students of the State Board

 ) jaisaa ki ummid thi, manmohan mantrimandal main yah pherbadal ek fori kavayad banakar rah gaya
 It is clear that the Congress did not allow Manmohan Singh to make any major changes
 aise samay main jab ki party bhrashtachar ke maamle main buree tarah se ghiri he or nyaaypalika kii aalochana kaa lagaataar shikaar ho rahi he, congress sambhavat: sarkaar main koi bada pherbadal nahin karnaa chaahati thi
 The two most important changes that have taken place in this reshuffle are the changes in the highest posts in the Ministry of Law and the Ministry of Environment
 spasht he ki manmohan singh ko ek aise kanoon mantri kii darkarathi jo ki telecom ghotaale, kaale dhan ke mudde par nyaaypalika ke saath takaraav ko kam kar sake or vivaadaaspad lokapal bill tathaa nyaayik javabdehi vidheyak ko unke anjaam tak pahunchaa sake
 Also could constitute a new law commission
 purv kanoon mantri virappa moili ummiido par khare nahin utar sake
 However, this future will tell to what extent the new Law Minister Salman Khurshid is able to fulfill the expectations of Manmohan Singh
 purv paryaavaran mantri jairam ramesh ne bhi paryaavaran mantralay ko hameshaa hi surkhiyon main yaa kahen ki vivaadon main banaae rakhaa
 However, he has been removed from the Ministry of Environment and given the responsibility of the Ministry of Rural Development
 ummid he ki gramin vikaas mantralai main ramesh kuch acha kaam kar sakenge
 Although Manmohan Singh has tried to keep incompetent ministers away from the cabinet, there are still some ministers who hold cabinet positions
 udhaaharan ke liye trinmul congress ke netaa or rail rajya mantri mukul raay ne rail durghatana sthal kaa daura karne ke pradhanmantri ke nirdesh kii avhelnaa kii thi or unhen baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya janaa chahie tha
 But he has been removed from the Ministry of Railways only to be the Minister of State in the Ministry of Shipping
 is mantrimandal main korporate link ke saath kuch yuva chehron ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya he
 It remains to be seen whether they will bring some changes or they will work to advance the interests of their patrons, this will tell the time to come
 kul milakar is pherbadal se koi bada parivartan hota prathit nahin hota
 It seems that the purpose of the shuffle was to avoid some ministers and get rid of the ministers who did not work, but because of the pressure, it could not be done while some vacancies could be filled and some more people could be allowed

 Cultivating contradictions in politics is also a big politics
 kam se kam isi bahaane pidipi bijepi ko kareeb se dekh legi or bijepi pidipi ko
 This is a good sign for the politics of the country
 isse pehle ki yah badlaav afzal guru ke avasheshon kii maang or aatankwaadiyon kaa shukriya adaa karne ke vivaadon kii bhent chadh jaae rajdhani dilli main ek or mudde kii barsaat hoti rahi
 With the overnight rain, the Aam Aadmi party got soaked within the party that the morning statements eliminated all possibilities of dry land
 yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan achaanak khalanaayak kii tarah pesh kiye jane lage jo arvind kejariwal ko party ke sanyojak pad se hataanaa chaahate hai
 Saw a letter of such allegations and then the statements of the leaders in the press
 soshal media par 'ai trust kejariwal' to 'kejarivalkalt' kaa hashtag chalane laga
 Some were showing confidence in Arvind to settle the dispute and some were blaming Yogendra
 kisi ne unka bina naam liye likhaa ki jab ham anna andolan main laathiyaan kha rahe the kuch log rahul gandhi kii dallali kha rahe the
 This tweet written in Hindi on the open laptop of Yogendra got noticed thinking that my tweet is not being read here! But after reading the tweet, i became convinced that in the interview, Yogendra's humble optimism of everything being within limits should not be trusted
 yogendra ne baar-baar puche jane par yahi kaha ki arvind par bharosa he
 He is a big leader
 itihaas main unki aisi bhoomika he jaisi kam netaaon ne nibhaai he
 i was repeatedly being asked by Yogendra whether you are in the Aam Aadmi Party or not
 kya aapke or arvind ke bich samvaad samaapt ho gaya he
 Every time Yogendra was saying that why are you asking that all possibility is gone
 hamaari party koi kamazor party nahin he
 If questions do not arise there, where will they arise? phir bhi hindi main likhaa dallali vaala vah twit khatak rahaa tha
 Who did what in the Anna movement is starting to be accounted for
 apane thode se anubhav se jaanata hum
 When this situation of calculation between friends comes, then no one can save the friendship
 vah samaapt ho jaati he
 This feast of friendship before Holi was also interesting
 laga ki patrakarita kya kya dikhaati he
 Yogendra Yadav, with whom many of us used to go to understand politics, was asking Yogendra whether you have any ambitions
 peshey kii yahi nirmamata mujhe pasand he
 This is the time of examination
 usee tarah arvind or aruna raay jab san 2000 ke saal ke aas paas sundaranagari main soochna ke adhikaar par bite dete the, to lagata tha ki ye adhikaar kya bhalaa he
 Which world are these people talking about
 dilli chunaav ke dauraan us arvind se bhi poocha ki sarkaar he yaa dukaan
 Arvind's statement was that i know Baniya hoon business
 jaise pandrah saal pehle soochna ke adhikaar ko lekar main apane simit anubhavon se sawaal karata tha or shankaa ke saath lautataa tha vaise hi kisi party ke bheetar swaraj ke sawaal par hairat or shankaa se laut aayaa
 It is another matter that how many patriots ate even the bullet for the right to information today
 main pandrah saal baad galat sabit ho gaya or aaj iske paimaane par kai dalo kii kapi check hoti he
 Do you know whether any party will implement Swaraj within themselves
 lekin agar aap ne daawa kiya he to is aadhaar par bhi kapi to check hogi hi
 At the moment, Yogendra also does not want to back down on his questions
 yah zarur kaha ki ham kisi dedline kii baat nahin kar rahe hai
 All our questions can be considered slowly in the coming time
 subah tivi par ke si tyaagi or tarik anwar ke bayaan dekh rahaa tha
 His statements were more restrained
 shivasena ke ek netaa to yah kehane se inkaar kar diya ki unka aantarik maamla he ham kya kahen
 This was the reaction of the leaders of the parties, where there is a dispute, the leader is settled in two minutes
 koi hairaani bhi nahin zaahir karata
 The exodus also begins to form his own group in two minutes to molest his former leader
 sabane isi raajnneeti ko to dekha he or janaa he
 Aam Aadmi Party has become two poles
 arvind or yogendra ke bich ab bahut pani bah chukaa he
 Talking to other journalists and many people within the party felt that there was no way back
 isliye kai baar yogendra se isi aadhaar par sawaal kiya ki aap nikaal die jaaenge aisa kaha ja rahaa he
 Once he went to Dabbaba, but from his answer it seemed that he was narrating himself
 koi unki sunne vaala nahin hai
 The paths have been separated
 kai baar jo jawaab diya jaataa he darasal wo sawaal kii tarah hota he
 This is the most enjoyable time for journalists when there is a crisis in politics, but all these questions are few
 jis par duusare dal ke log shaayad hi bolen
 Along with the source of the funds, give the account of the expenses, put the candidate's boedata and details on the website, bring Swaraj in the party and let the state units decide on the model of Swaraj
 koun party is bavaal ko apane sar par legi
 Will the Aam Aadmi Party survive? is vakt is sawaal ke jawaab kii ummid karnaa is party se bhi jyaadati hogi
 The question now is whether Arvind Kejriwal and Yogendra Yadav are together
 mujhe to lagata he ki nahin hai
 But the real answer will be found when Arvind speaks on this issue
 ek patrkaar ko adatan shaq karnaa hi chahie
 Questions get way only from doubt
 dilli kii raajnneeti hairaan he
 The two leaders of the party that gave historic support to 67 seats could not live together for a month
 yah bhi ek itihaas hi hoga
 Politics quickly digests such history
 ek itihaas to yah bhi he ki arvind se jo ladaa wo itihaas ban gaya
 But is this battle another forgotten history book or something
 bas log vahi purana sawaal zarur puuchhenge ki aap dusron se alag kaise
 Is it because they are easily separated

 ek banarsi kapade par rashtrapita mahatma gandhi or unke charakhe kii tasviir
 
 
 Dear bhajan of 'bapu' on other clothes "vaishnav jana to tehne jaye, pir parai jane re
 
 
 " yah kapade par maamuli chapai nahin he, banaras ke bunakaron kii vah nayab hastkala he, jo unke karghe yani handloom ke taane-bane se taiyaar hui he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is coming to his parliamentary constituency Varanasi on September 18, so, weaver Bachilal, resident of Chhai village of Sarnath, has prepared this organ with a calligraphy on handloom, giving a portrait of the father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi
 And also Bapu's favorite hymns have also been written
 bunakar bachchelal is angavastr ko banane ke liye apane hathkarghe par kai dinon se talleenta se kaam kar rahe hai
 The specialty of his weaving is that he makes anything with the magic of his hand on cloth
 isse pehle unhone kabir ke bhajan ke dupattey banaae the, lekin chunki is baar pradhanmantri ko angavastr bhent karnaa he, lihaaja unhone gandhi ji, unka charkha or unka priy bhajan ukera he
 Why so, on this question, Bachlal says that the condition of weavers is not hidden from anyone
 
 
 hamen lagata he ki agar koi phir se gandhi ji kii soch ke saath aa jayega to shaayad ham jaise logon kii pidaa ko behatar samajhakar hamaari taraf dhyaan de saktaa he
 Significantly, ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi became the MP and Prime Minister of Varanasi, the weavers were awakened to hope that their good days would come
 pradhanmantri ne bhi bunakaron ko rashtriya hathkargha diwas par trade fecilitation centre, india handloom brands or 'ustad' jaisi yojanaon kaa tohfa dene kii ghoshnaa kii, jisase ek ummid to jaagi he, par vishwaas abhi nahin ban paaya, kyonki koi yojana abhi zamin par nahin ai he, lekin banaras or bunakaron kii ummiden ab bhi zindaa hai
 The comments human welfare association ke chairman dow rajnikant kehete hai ki pradhanmantri ne bunakaron ko tohfa diya he
 Now, according to the rich tradition of Banaras, we are trying to give a gift to the Prime Minister
 apane saansad ke liye kaashi ke bunakaron kaa yah sneh bhi koi nai baat nahin
 
 
 Even before this, Bachlal had sent the gift of Kabir's couplets as a gift to the Prime Minister on the occasion of Handloom Day, but the promises that the Prime Minister had made for them have not reached them yet, so, this dying art But this time how the Prime Minister assures them, so that their days will be spoiled with their art, it will be a matter to be seen
 pradhanmantri narendra modi 18 sitambar ko apane sansadeey kshetra varanasi aa rahe hai, so, sarnath ke chhaahin gaanv nivasee bunakar bachchelal ne unhen dene ke liye yah angavastr hathkarghe par kellingraphy se taiyaar kiya he, jisamen rashtrapita mahatma gandhi kaa charkha chalaate chitra banaaya gaya he, or saath hi baapu ke priy bhajan bhi likhe gaye hai
 Weaver Bachlal has been working diligently on his handloom for several days to make this corset
 unki bunakari kii khaasiyat he ki kapade par apane haath ke jaadu se vah kuch bhi bana dete hai
 Earlier, he had made dupattas of Kabir's hymns, but since this time the Prime Minister has to offer Angastra, he has carved Gandhiji, his spinning wheel and his favorite bhajan
 aisa kyon, is sawaal par bachchelal kehete hai ki ham bunakaron kii dasha kisi se chhipi nahin
 
 
 We feel that if someone comes again with Gandhiji's thinking, then perhaps we can better understand the suffering of people like us and pay attention to us
 gauratlab he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi jab se varanasi ke saansad or pradhanmantri bane, tabhi se bunakaron ko ummid jag gai ki ab unke achche din aa jaaenge
 The Prime Minister also announced the gift of weavers to schemes such as Trade Facilitation Center, India Handloom Brand and 'ustad' on National Handloom Day, which has raised hope, but no confidence has been created as no plan is on the ground yet
 Has come, but the hopes of Banaras and weavers are still alive
 tippaniyan Dr
 Rajinikanth, chairman of the Human Welfare Association, says that the Prime Minister has gifted the weavers
 ab banaras kii samrudh parampara ke anusaar, ham yah prayaas kar rahe hai ki pradhanmantri ko tohfa diya jaae
 This affection of Kashi weavers for their MP is also not new
 
 
 isse pehle bhi bachchelal ne hathkargha diwas ke maukey par pradhanmantri ko kabir ke dohe kaa angavastr tohfe ke rup main bheja tha, lekin pradhanmantri ne jo vaade inke liye kiye the, ve ab tak inke paas nahin pahunche hai, so, is mar rahi kala ke liye is baar pradhanmantri inhen kaise bharosa dilaate hai, jisase inaki kala ke saath inke din bahurenge, yah dekhne vaali baat hogi

 jammu-kashmir kii mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ne police bal kaarykram ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki sthaneey aatankiyon ko encounter main maaraa na jaae, unhen ghar waapas laayaa jaae
 Chief Minister Mufti said that the AFSPA Act which gives special powers to the army by which they can search any house or suspect if it is suspected, is not forever
 police bal ke kaarykram main logon ko sambodhit karte hue mahabuuba mufti ne kaah, hamaare bachche jo aatankwaadi ban gaye hai, main police se apil karti hum ki aisi koshish kii jaae ki ve waapas aaen
 Instead of being shot down in the encounter, they should be added back to the main stream
 unke haathon main bandook ke bajaae bat or ball thamaya jaae to behatar hoga
 The Mufti stressed that it is very important, to create an atmosphere of peace and harmony in Jammu and Kashmir
 hinsa par baat karte hue mufti ne kaha, main pallage gan ko bain karnaa chaahati hum, lekin iske liye sarkaar ko aap logon kaa samarthan chahie
 Our children have always been used as armor
 ham kisi ko unpar pathar phenkakar baatcheet karne ke liye nahin kah sakate
 If we have to negotiate, we have to stop militancy
 mufti ke yah bayaan tab aayaa he jab soshal media par hijbul mujahiddin ke aatankiyon kaa ek video aayaa jo kisi baag main shoot kiya gaya he jisamen ye log ek duusare ko gale laga rahe hai or badhai de rahe hai
 It reminds of the terrorist Burhan Wani killed in an encounter
 tippaniyan Vani used to use social media a lot so that the youth can be mixed with them
 kai video or photo main vah hathiyaar ke saath dikhaai diya or suraksha balon par taana martha dikhaai diya
 This video was shared on Facebook and whatsapp
 bataa den ki aatanki burhan vaani ke 8 july ko maare jane ke baad se lagaataar rajya main virod pradarshan jari he or ab tak in pradarshnon main 90 se zyada logon kii maut ho chuki he jabaki 12000 se zyada log ghayal ho chuke hai
 It is being told that such a large number of injured are the result of use of pellet guns
 mukhyamantri mufti ne kaha ki afspa kanoon jisase sena ko vishesh takat milti he jisase ve shaq hone par kisi bhi ghar kii talaashi le sakate hai yaa phir unhen hiraasat main le sakate hai, hameshaa ke liye nahin he
 While addressing the people at the program of the police force, Mehbooba Mufti said, Kah, our children who have become terrorists, i appeal to the police to make an effort that they come back
 encounter main maar giraae jane kii bajaae unhen waapas mukhya dhara main joda jaae
 It would be better if they hold bat and ball instead of gun in their hands
 mufti ne jor dekar kaha ki yah behad jaruri he, jammu-kashmir main shanti or sadbhaav kaa vaataavaran banaaya jaae
 Talking about the violence, Mufti said, i want to ban the pelage gun, but for this the government needs the support of you people
 hameshaa se hamaare bacchon kaa kavach ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 We cannot ask anyone to throw stones at them and talk
 agar hamen baatcheet kerani he to hamen militancy rokani hogi
 The Mufti's statement came on social media when a video of Hizbul Mujahideen's terrorists was shot in a garden where they are hugging and congratulating each other

 manahani ke maamalon par jari circular par kejariwal sarkaar ne supreme court main halafanama daakhil kiya he
 The affidavit filed on Section 499, 599 of IPC states - agar supreme court ko lagata he ki ye circular galat he, to sarkaar ise waapas lene ko taiyaar he
 The purpose of issuing circulars is not for misuse of law but for its protection
 pehle is kanoon ke istemaal ke liye koi prakriya nahin thi, lekin dilli sarkaar ne iske liye teen chakri yojana banaai he
 If a minister or officer feels that he has been defamed, he will send the case to the Principal Secretary Home
 jaanch ke baad maamle ko diarector of prosecution ko bheja jayega
 After scrutiny from here, it will be sent to the Law Ministry
 iske baad hi is kanoon ke tahat maamla darj kiya ja sakegaa
 If the court feels that this is not right, then the government is ready to withdraw it
 6 may ko dilli sarkaar ne ye circular jari kiya tha
 a defamation case can be filed when the news comes in the media
 ullekhneey he ki khud arvind kejariwal ne supreme court main is kanoon ko chunauti di thi
 Four cases against Kejriwal were stayed by the Supreme Court
 14 may ko supreme court ne circular par roak lagaakar dilli sarkaar se jawaab maanga tha
 Earlier, Subramanian Swamy and Rahul Gandhi have also challenged this law

 Australia won the Melbourne ODI by 3 wickets
 is jeet ke saath hi australia ne 5 match kii vanade series main 3-0 kii ajey badhat hasil kar lee
 Virat Kohli definitely scored a century but due to poor performance of bowlers and fielders, Team India had to face defeat
 ab series ke baaqi do vanade main captain emes dhoni kaa kadaa imtihaan hoga
 After the win, Glenn Maxwell took a sarcasm at the Indian batsmen and said that some people play for their records
 match ke baad press conference main ek patrkaar ne purv australian ballebaaz mathew heden ke hawaale se poocha ki shatak ke qareeb bhartiya ballebaazon ke ran-rate gir jate hai
 Responding to this, Maxwell, popularly known as Big Show, said, 'I think Indian batsmen tend to play slower because of their desire to achieve a milestone in their career
 ' Hayden had earlier made a statement on Indian batsmen that Indian batsmen play for their personal records
 heden ke mutabik agar koi ballebaaz 70 yaa 80 ran banaata he to saavdhaanee se ballebaazi kar 100 bhi bana saktaa he lekin australian ballebaaz aisa nahin karte - bhale hi isse unke record par asar pade

 During this time, there was a need to score fast
 shuukravaar ke bristben vanade main jab rohit out hue to 43waan over phenkaa ja rahaa tha - aise main unke baad aane vaale ballebaazon ke paas zyaada kuch karne ke liye nahin rahaa
 However, Kohli showed little sense in this matter and took only 7 balls to reach 90 to 100
 pichley kuch samay se karaab pradarshan se jujh rahe shikhar dhawan ke form par sawaal uth rahe the
 In Melbourne, he shared a 119-run partnership for the second wicket with Virat but it was 22 runs
 2 over main! jahaan ran-rate badhaane kii zarurat thi vahaan dhawan dhimaa khelte rahe or 68 ran banane ke liye 91 gend kheli
 On the other hand, look at Maxwell's innings - Australia lost 3 wickets when Maxwell came to bat after George Bailey's dismissal but he continued to play his natural game
 tippaniyan On the score of 47 runs, Maxwell was out in the sneeometer which was not given by the umpire but this did not reduce the speed of his shots and completed the half-century with a six

 At least 11 people were killed and several others injured when a two-storey hotel building collapsed in Secunderabad, Andhra Pradesh, on Monday morning
 raashtrapati road par sthit city lite hotel kii imaarat subah 6
 She fell down at around 30 am
 police, greater hyderabad nagar nigam (jiechaemasi) ke adhikari, fire brigade or siaisef ke jawan malba hataane or fanse hue logon ko baahar nikaalane ke liye raahat evam bachaav kaam main lage hue hai
 After visiting the spot, the Hyderabad police chief said that the injured have been admitted to the nearby hospital
 unhone bataaya ki hotel ke rasoi ghar vaale sthaan par malbe main or bhi kuch logon ke dabe hone kii ashanka hai
 GHMC Commissioner MT Krishna Babu, who was present at the scene, said that there are many old buildings in the area and their owners were issued notices in this regard
 unhone kaha ki is baat kaa pataa lagaaya ja rahaa he ki haadase kaa shikaar hui imaarat bhi isi suchi main shaamil thi yaa nahin
 It has become easier to take admission in MBBS college, where earlier candidates used to score 50 percent marks for admission, now candidates can also enroll by securing 20 percent marks
 pichley do saalon se neshnal eligibility kam entrens test (NEET) main physics main 5 fisadi, camestry main 10 fisadi se kam or biology main 20 fisadi ank laane vaale ummidavaaron ko bhi medical college main admician mil rahaa he
 You may be surprised to know this, but it has been possible due to persistent in NEET exam
 darasal neet pariksha ke madhyam se merit ke aadhaar par ummidavaaron kaa chayan nahin kiya jaataa he or ek nishchit percentaile hasil karne vaale ummidavaar admician lene ke liye yogya hote hai
 Let us know that NEET was made compulsory for MBBS admission in the year 2016
 SC : 'neet' pariksha ke liye aadhaar jaruri nahieadmician ke liye chahie 18 pratishtatimes of india kii ek report ke anusaar isse pehle admician kii cat-of 50 fisadi (general category) or 40 fisadi (arakshit category) tak jaati thi or uske aadhaar par admician hota tha, lekin ab neet main 18-20 fisadi ank laane vaale ummidavaar bhi admician le pate hai
 Know what is percentile? Please tell that percentile is different from percentage and it is based on the ratio, not on the digits
 50 percentaile kaa matlab yah nahin he ki aapako 50 fisadi ank praapt hue hai, kyonki yah anupaat ke aadhaar par tay hota he
 Here 50 percentile means half the children getting the lowest marks from the bottom, besides the other candidates
 bataa den ki percentaile marks or rank ke aadhaar par tay hoti he or neet main marks ke aadhaar par tay kii jaati he
 To know his percentage, the candidate has to divide the number of topper's digits in his number and multiply it by 100
 jo rigelt aayega wo aapkaa percentaile hoga
 How did it happen? Actually, it was necessary to get 50 percent marks first, for which candidates had to get 360 marks out of 720 marks
 lekin ab ummidavaaron ko 50 percentaile number ke liye 720 main se sirf 145 ank hi laane hote hai, jo ki sirf 20 fisadi he
 Therefore, by scoring 18 to 20 percent marks in NEET, one can also get admission in MBBS
 aise hota he AIIMS main admician, jaane entress exam kaa selebasreport ke anusaar general category ke ummidavaaron ko 697 se 131 ank laane aavashyak hai, jisase 50 percentaile miltaa he or yah kul marks kaa mahaj 18
 2 percent
 vahiin obisi ko 14
 9, 16 for differently-abled candidates
 4 fisadi, obisi ke divyang ummidavaaron ko 14
 It is necessary to bring 9 per cent marks

 Rupani's allegations were vehemently rejected by Ahmed Patel and he spoke of his resignation from the hospital in 2014
 haalanki bijepi lagaataar patel ke khilaaf aakraamak ruukh apanaae hue he
 Accusations on Ahmed Patel baseless: After Congressmanupani's allegations, the Congress accused the BJP of unabashedly accusing Rajya Sabha MP Ahmed Patel of having links with terrorists in order to avoid defeat in the Gujarat elections
 patel ke khilaaf gujarat ke mukhyamantri vijay roopani ke aarope par pratikriya dete hue congress pravaktaa surajevaala ne kaha, "bijepi gujarat main haar se dar rahi he or isliye ghabrahat main vah dusron par managasaint aarope laga rahi he
 Truth will prevail and BJP will lose in Gujarat
 "unhone kaha ki bijepi congress saansad ke khilaaf shadyantr rach rahi he, jabaki bijepi ko apane andar jhaankne kii jarurat he
 'BJP conspiracy against Ahmed Patel' Surjewala said, "sardar Patel Hospital is a charitable hospital, which employs 150-200 employees
 na hi ahamed patel or na hi unke parivaar ke anya sadsy aspataal ke trustee hai
 They are not even connected to any benefit from the hospital
 stimberwaala vahaan ek karmchaaree tha
 "he said that if there is evidence against the suspected terrorist, the ATS should investigate it

 In the same way, he honors Lord Macaulay, a Victorian scholar who brought English to India in the 1830s, and celebrates his birthday on 25 October as English Day
 maikole vichaardhaara ke takaajon kii bajaae vyaavhaarik maksadon se zyada prerit the
 British rulers needed a contact language to rule in areas with different languages like Tamil Nadu, Bengal and Maharashtra
 takreeban do sadiyaan bitne ke baad bhi angreji kii vah prashasnic anivaaryta na sirf aaj bhi kaayam he, balki pehle se zyada bad gai he
 The central government has been campaigning vigorously to promote Hindi for 70 years
 iske baavjood aaj bhi bharat kii aadhi se kam aabaadi hindi bolti he or desh ke dakshini tathaa uttar-purvi ilaakon main vah angreji se zyada paraai bhashaa he
 Is there an elite class of English-speaking people in India who oppress others? If you look at the modern history of India, the truth is the opposite
 maikole ne tabhi yah sahi-sahi anumaan laga liya tha ki angreji kii badaulat hindustani log vigyaan, chikitsa or technology main hone vaali vaishvik pragati kii malumat kar sakenge
 Time has proved him right
 aaj scandenevia se lekar china tak tamaam desh angreji ko apni ucch shiksha kii bhashaa ke taur par apana rahe hai
 Macaulay also saw that the English would spread liberal political and economic ideas in India and eventually bring the Indians to the political parity of their British rulers
 itihaas ne phir unhen sahi sabit kiya
 This was the reason that the lawyers who grew up in Western education gave independence to India and established it as a secular landlord
 yahaan tak ki unhone westminster model par aadhaarit sansad ko sweekaar kiya
 The incident like the Magna Carta is not the second in India's pre-colonial history
 angreji nahin hoti, to bharat ke liye kanoon kii hukumat ko apnaanaa kaaphi mushkil hota, kyonki isse pehle mulk main is avadharana kii koi vakphiyat hi nahin thi
 The system of arbitrary rules and religious prohibitions was in force at the time, which was completely different from the rule of law
 isi tarah, kanoon ke aage sabhi kii barabari par aadhaarit nyaayik vyavastha bhi nahin hoti, kyonki yah bhi utani hi videshi avadharana he
 And finally: if there was no colonial rule linking the country through English as a common language, then India would have no existence as a political unit

 Panikkar's words may be considered the final verdict on Macaulay's legacy

 Studying English is no longer the legacy of a small, hereditary ruling class, but working families are adopting it as an alternative
 iskaa bhi koi saboot nahin he ki angreji desi bhashaaon ko nuksaan pahunchaa rahi he
 Most English-speaking Hindustani use "desi" languages in their domestic life

 The most valuable thing of our English heritage, it is precisely because of this that it has to suffer the attacks of religious and cultural fundamentalists
 angreji jabaan udaar, secular or vaigyanik vichaaron ko shakl detii he
 It does not have the same burden and awkward words which the Hindi people had to compose to explain the basics of our Constitution

 With the decision of the local people to separate Ladakh from Kashmir, Khushladakh has now become a Union Territory i
e
 Union Territory
 Ladakh has become a Union Territory in the lap of Himalaya
 kam aabaadi vaala ladakh do deshon kii seemaa se judaa ahm ilaaka he
 The historical proposal which was brought in the Parliament of India on Monday changed not only the history of Ladakh but also the geography
 isamen jammu-kashmir or ladakh do centreshasit bana die gaye hai
 The status of Ladakh will be like Chandigarh
 leh ke rimpoche hawaii adde par halaat saamaanya hai
 Tourists are coming
 sadakon par tasviir saamaanya he
 Local tourist guides standing in wait for tourists at the airport are happy to get a new identity for Ladakh

 There are shops
 leh ke rahane waalon ne modi sarkaar ke is faisle kaa khule dil se swaagat kiya he
 Namdak Lodas, who has been doing business in Leh's most prominent market for 20 years, says, "we have been demanding this for years because Kashmir never considered Ladakh as its own
" ab ummid he hamaara bhala hoga
 The locals and those who live in Leh market are happy with the decision to separate Ladakh from Kashmir
 jammu kashmir ke is chote se bhaag ko uski alag pahchaan mil chuki he
 According to the draft of the partition of Jammu and Kashmir with the repeal of Article 370 from Kashmir in the country's Parliament, Ladakh now became Union Territory i
e
 Union Territory, according to the Home Minister Amit Shah of NDA Government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 is
 jammu kashmir main khinche gaye nae nakshe ke mutabik, leh or kargil ke do jilon ko milakar vistrut aakaar main failaa ladakh, bharat kaa naunva centre shasit pradesh hoga
 Not only this, this identification of Ladakh is also very important in view of the border of Pakistan and China in the east and west
 ladakh ke log saalon se khud ko alag kiye jane kii maang kar rahe thesindhu kii sabhyataa or bharat main buddha dharm kaa ek prasiddh centre mana jane vaala ladakh dashakon se apni ek alag pahchaan kii maang karata rahaa
 Since 1947, Ladakh was present in the structure of Jammu and Kashmir but it could not get its right in the politics of Jammu and Kashmir
 shaayad isliye ladakh ke log saalon se khud ko alag kiye jane kii maang kar rahe the
 PT Kunjung, president of Ladakh Buddhist Association, says, 'it was only in 1949 that the Buddhist Favored Association of Ladakh sacked the then Prime Minister Nehru to make Ladakh not a part of Jammu Kashmir, development does not reach Ladakh nor Jammu Kashmir
 The government of Ladakh pays attention to Ladakh
 'ladaakh buddhist association ke mutabik, kai dashakon se ladakh ko alag pahchaan dilaane or kashmir se alag karwaane ke liye ilaake main lagaataar sangharsh hote rahe
 a few decades ago, 3 children of Ladakh were also killed in a similar movement
 ladakh ko centre shasit pradesh banane ke peeche modi sarkaar kii niti shaayad isliye bhi ho sakati he kyonki ladakh bharat ke liye sirf bhugolic hi nahin balki samrik drushti se bhi mahatvapurn he
 Ladakh will be the highest state on the map of India, linking the borders of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir with Baltistan in the north, Karakoram and Siachen in the north, the controversial Aksai China with China in the east and China-occupied Tibet in the southeast
 ladakh ke uttar purv main aksai china jis par china kaa kabja he, uske saath purana vivaad chal rahaa he
 In 1962, there has also been a war between India and China over Aksai China
 ladakh ko centre shasit pradesh banane kii vakaalat karne waalon kaa kahana he ki jab bhi bharat ko dushmano ne gheraa bhartiya fouj kii madad ke liye sabase pehle ladakh ke log saamne aae
 In 1993 and 1996, an agreement was finally signed between the two countries on the Line of Actual Control
 ye or baat he ki duniya main bhu-mafia ke naam se janaa jane vaala china bhartiya ilaake main bhi ghuspaith se baj nahin aata
 After coming under the center, the development of Ladakh must be divided into two parts - Leh and Kargil
 ladakh ke log lambey samay se centreshasit pradesh kii maang kar rahe the
 Leaders of Ladakh BJP have been accusing the old governments of Jammu and Kashmir for being half-hearted against Ladakh
 ladakh bijepi adhyaksh dorje lanchuk kaa kahana he, 'ladakh saanskrithik rup se kashmir se alag he
 Also, strategically, the area is important for India even though no government of Jammu and Kashmir has paid attention to the development of Ladakh, but now after coming directly under the center, the development of Ladakh will definitely happen
 'ab jab modi sarkaar ne ichhashakti dikhaate hue ladakh ko uskaa haq dilaane kaa faisla liya he to bharat ke nakshe main sabase oonche kshetra main jashn manaaya ja rahaa he
 Ladakh, who has been disregarded by his own government for seven decades, feels that his good days will surely come
 ranneetik rup se bharat ke liye behad mahatvapurn is ilaake ke log ab nai pahchaan paakar behad khush hai
 Even though the tension in the valley is less, but it is time for Ladakh to celebrate

 Avoid agitating against Nitish Kumar's government

 He said that the truth is that Congress President Sonia Gandhi gave the state leadership of the party a few months ago the freedom to prepare a political and agitational program to increase the base of the Congress in Bihar
 gauratlab he ki media main aayi khabar main kaha gaya tha ki congress ke bihar prabharee gulchain singh charak ne party kii pradesh ikai dwaara rajya kii rajg sarkaar ke khilaaf taiyaar kiye gaye andolanaatmak kaaryakam ko hari jhandi nahin di thi
 Varma, while denouncing the news, said that if such a thing happened, then why would the Congress also instruct the Congress to join Bihar bandh on October 15 in protest against the police firing in Madhubani district of Bihar in-charge of the party
 yah puche jane par ki kya bihar kii nitish sarkaar ke khilaaf andolanaatmak kaarykram chalaae jane ko lekar koi prastaav party alaakaman ko saunpa gaya he, verma ne isse inkaar kiya

 input-bhashaa Bhavna Gaur, an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) candidate from Palam in Delhi, has been caught in two major controversies
 un par aise iljaam hai, jinke chalate party unki ummidavaari waapas bhi le sakati he
 Currently, a committee comprising Professor Anand Kumar, Prashant Bhushan and Ashish Khaitan is investigating the allegations against him
 yah samiti 4 disambar tak apana faisla party ko bataaegi or bhaavana goud ke bare main apni sanstuti degi
 The AAP, which claimed to give tickets to the people of the muffleman's-manaf image to be the Messiah for the AAP, has also announced Bhavna Gaur's name in the first list of its candidates
 hamen mili exclusive jaankaree ke mutabik, bhaavana do aise vivaadon main fansi hai, jo unhen 'saaf chhavi kaa netaa' to haragij sabit nahin karte
 One of these allegations is an alleged lie about his educational qualifications and the other is an old case of illegal construction in a rented house
 sutron ke mutabik, shaikshik yogyata ke bare main alag-alag daawey karne ke maamle main party kii samiti ne unhen bari kar diya he
 But in case of occupation of the house, the committee will take a final decision
 prashanth bhushan or unke kanoonee visheshgy sahyogi rishi court main chale is maamle or court ke faisle kii puri jaanch karenge
 Highly placed sources said that the committee can take a final decision on Bhavna Gaur's allegations by December 4 and recommend it to the party
 AAP ummidavaaron kii duusari soochipahla vivaad: shaikshik yogyatabhaavna goud ne chunaav ayog ko die halafname or aam aadmi party ke liye bhare form main apni shaikshik yogyata alag-alag bataai he

 is dauraan vah bijepi kii parshad hua karti thim
 (go to the end of the story to read the full court order) An angry faction of AAP activists? Remember that the Aam Aadmi Party has been saying that they give tickets only after a thorough investigation and if even after that When a complaint is received against someone, a committee investigates those allegations
 aarope sahi paae jane par party pratyaashiyon se tikat waapas lene kaa daawa bhi karti he
 The case of allegations on Bhavna Gaur was also revealed last time, but the party gave him a clean chit after investigation
 is saal dobaaraa shikaayat ai he to party kii samiti jaanch kar rahi he
 However, a group of AAP activists in Palam is slogan from the party leadership and is demanding the withdrawal of Bhavna Goud's name
the diplomatic bhaavana goud ke maamle mencourt kii belizeparty pravaktaa kaa diplomatic jawabahaalanki aupchaarik taur par party is bare main kuch bhi nahin bataa rahi
 When he spoke to AAP spokesperson Atishi Marlena, he just said that if a complaint comes against a candidate, there is a committee to investigate those allegations
 agar bhaavana goud ke bare main shikaayat aegi to unki bhi jaanch kii jaaegi
 When asked if any complaint against Bhavna was made in the party forum, Atishi said it was an internal matter of the party and refused to answer
 bhaavana banaam milan kaa maamla to nahin!sutara bataa rahe hai ki party bhaavana goud kaa tikat kaatane se isliye batch rahi he kyonki palam se uske paas bhaavana ke mukaable koi majboot ummidavaar nahin he
 In any case, the AAP trying to return to power does not want to take the risk of landing a 'weak' candidate
 haalanki palam se milan bhi tikat kii daud main the
 Milan has been a batchmate of Shaheed Manjunath and a faction of activists here was in favor of giving him tickets
 sutron ke mutabik, party netaa yah jaanate hai ki milan ke samarthak jaan-boojhkar bhaavana goud ke vivaad ko hawa de rahe hai
 However, that faction of AAP activists says that if party Bhavna presents an example by withdrawing Gaur's name, then they are ready to walk shoulder to shoulder with the party

 That is the whole bath mantriyon ke zariye rajya kii raajnneeti badali ja sakati he to saare mantri upi se banaakar vahaan chaar sau main se do sau siten jiti ja sakati hai
 It could also be won in Bihar
 is lihaaz se to koi bhi party satta main aane ke baad kabhi chunaav hi nahin harati
 Make a minister of every state and caste
 kya daliton ke mantri bana dene se daliton kii samasya khatm ho jaaegi? jab rohit vemula se lekar daliton ke tamaam mudde uthte rahe tab yahi tamata,raaj, meghavaal yaa athavle kahaan the
 When the issue of abolishing reservation came up during the Bihar elections, why did not these Dalit faces come up
 unke to bayaan bhi sunai nahin die
 Then as soon as he became the minister, how is the Dalit considered to be represented? bijepi ke paas sabase adhik dalit saansad hai
 Then why did the national president have to do politics of bathing in harmony in Kumbh? Did the rest of the Dalit mps also take a bath with them? Due to UP, Dalit mps have become ministers, so what was the deficiency in Udit Raj? Will he also get a big ministry due to being a Dalit? Will become Minister of State for Finance or will continue to be Minister of Social Welfare or Child Welfare
 cabinet mantri ban rahe hai ye dalit saansad yaa rajya mantri? rajya mantriyon ke paas kya kaam hota he, achaanak charchaaon se gaayab hai
 Arun Jaitley and Kalraj Mishra have been described as Brahmin faces by these TV experts
 calraj mishra ke rahete hue mahendra pandey ko brahman cheharaa bataane kaa kya tuk he? kya mahendra pandey calraj mishra se bade netaa hai yaa calraj mishra ab brahman netaa nahin rahe? aresas pramukh praaia: brahman hi hote hai
 Many Brahmin leaders are also established in BJP
 kya ye sabhi upi main brahman vot nahin laa sakate
 i do not understand many times on what basis we see someone's caste bigger than politics
 agar chunaav or jati ke aadhaar par hi ye saansad banaae gaye hai to do saal baad hue is pehle vistaar se yahi lagata he ki modi hi nahin bhartiya raajnneeti ke paas koi nayaa idia nahin he
 There was a lot of discussion about the picture of two mps coming to Parliament by bicycle
 bina shaq ye saraahneey kaary he
 But before making him the representative face of the environment, at least it would be seen what the environmental policies of the government are
 unke kya asar hone vaale hai
 The bicycle is the final representative, so what is the policy? vaise meghavaal shreshth saansad chune gaye hai or prashasnic anubhav bhi he unke paas
 But when all the Dalit mps like him do not come up during the time of Dalit issues, how do they become representatives of all the Dalits from UP to India as soon as they become ministers
 he jaankaron, is lihaaz se to pradhanmantri ko ye karnaa chahie ki sabhi pramukh jatiyon ke sharma, patel, singh, sinha ko mantri banaakar so janaa chahie
 Not that i would have discussed anything differently
 main bhi hota to shaayad yahi sab baaten kar rahaa hota
 It is perhaps because of this that India's politics and its analysts have taken root
 unke paas koi nayaa paimaana nahin he
 Everything in our politics has been decided before we were born
 ham sab use paalane posane ke liye duniya main aae hai! har ankar duusare jaankaar ko sahi kah rahaa he ki aap upi ko dusron se acha jaanate hai
 You know Modi best
 nayaa kya bataa rahe ho jaankaron jo aap saare logon se behatar jaanate hai
 Tell Me No! Comments agar raajnneeti sirf chhavi or projection kaa khel he to janata ko dinabhar tivi hi dekhnaa chahie
 He should keep writing in the passbook the names of ministers of his caste instead of jobs, promotions and cheap studies and cheap hospitals
