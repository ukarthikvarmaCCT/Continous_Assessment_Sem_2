 When Jayalalitha took the oath of office as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu in 2001, Shankaracharya of Kanchi Sri Jayendra Saraswati was his spiritual teacher
 chaar saal baad november main jayalalita ne padosi rajya andhrapradesh ke mehboobnagar main rajya kii police ko bhejkar jayendra saraswati ko giraftaar kar chennai bula liya
 This arrest was made in the evening when Jayendra Saraswati was preparing to worship Trikala Sandhya
 agle din se karthik kaa maheenaa shuru ho rahaa tha or shankaracharya ko raatbhar jagakar puja-paath karnaa tha
 But the police of Tamil Nadu arrested him and brought him to Chennai in a special plane because that was Jayalalithaa's order
 'tumhen pataa he main koun hum? mujhe kuch ho gaya to puraa desh hill uthegaa
 'jayendra Saraswati said to the police team that came with the order of arrest from Jayalalithaa
 lekin giraftaar kii jimmedaari lekar aae police afasar kii kaan main jun tak nahin rengi
 In a few moments Jayendra Saraswati also understood that now she has no option but to go with the police force

 'tamil Nadu police kept quiet for a while
 jab jayendra saraswati kii jayalalita se sampark saadhane kii koshish vifal ho gai to vah apni puja bich main chhodkar jane ke liye taiyaar ho gaye

 According to the statements of the political corridors and the staff of the monastery, Jayalalithaa had sent her spiritual teacher Jayendra Saraswati behind bars simply because some of Jayalalithaa's close eyes were on the ground of the monastery

 dilli main pyaaj kii badhati keemton par dilli sarkaar kii badi laaparvaahee saamne ai he
 Nafed and the Union Agriculture Ministry had written three letters to the government during April and May and said that they can buy and keep onions at a cheaper rate if they want
 keemat bhi mahaj 19 rupye kilo
 But the Delhi government did not buy onions
 nafed ke diarector ashok thakurki maane to april or june main likhi chitthiyon kaa jawaab bhi nahin diya
 And finally the Delhiites were forced to buy 60 rupees onion
 dilli sarkaar kaa is puure maamle par bayaan dilli waalon ke manhagaai ke jakhmon par namak chhidakane jaisaa he
 Minister of Food and Distribution Department of Delhi, Asim Khan says that if Nafed gives 19 rupees onion, then we are ready to take today vahiin nafed ke diarector namit ashok thakur ajtak ke camere par khulkar bol rahe hai ki april se isi baat ke liye chitthee dilli sarkaar ko likhi ja rahi he ki monsoon main aalu or pyaaj kii keemton par asthirataa aati he
 Hence, under the Central Government's PSF i
e
 Price Stabilization Fund, in Lasalgaon Mandi, Nashik, where the Nafed has purchased and stocked onions, the Delhi government should buy the onion at the price being given to the farmers
 to 25 rupee hoti keemtathakur ke mutabik 19 se 20 rupye pratikilon ke bich milane vaali pyaaj agar nasik se dilli laakar bhi bechi jaati to bhi parivahan, bhandaaran or vitaran 5 se 6 rupye hi aata or dilli waalon ko pyaaj kam se kam 25 se adhiktam 30 rupye prati kilo mil sakati thi
 But in time, the Delhi government neither planned nor responded to the letters of NAFED
 dilli sarkaar ne apni safai main ek press relies jari kii he jisamen likhaa he ki nafed ko pyaaj kii keemton par bhram failaane waalon ko rokna chahie
 The Delhi government has also demanded from Nafed that Nafed should tell Delhi at what price it was willing to sell onions
 dilli sarkaar apni safai main 24 july kii chitthee kaa zikr to kar rahi he lekin 13 april or 18 june kii jo chitthee hamane exclusivli ajtak par dikhaai he us par sarkaar ke paas kehane ko kuch nahin he
 The opposition has clearly shown that the state BJP is marking the government for not stocking onions in time
 bijepi ke netaa kulajit chahal kaa kahana he ki ye dilli sarkaar ke ahankaar kaa ek bada saboot he
 How to buy onions from the central government against which it is running poster-wise
 jaahir he dilli sarkaar ko apane ahan kii chintaa he lekin dilli kii janata kii jeb kii nahin
 However, the question is not only to stock onions in time but also why Kejriwal government has not responded to the letters of NAFED in time
 sawaal to ye bhi he ki agar dilli 60 rupye kilo par pyaaj kharidne ko majaboor he to uski javabdeh kya dilli sarkaar nahin he?yahaan gaur karne kii baat ye bhi he ki philhal dilli sarkaar40 rupaye prati kilo ke dar serashan kii dukaanon ke jariye sonmvaar se logon ko sasta pyaaj muhaiyaa karaane ja rahi he
 The government claims that it is the same onion that has been purchased from the Nashik SFAC ie Small Former Agri Business Consortium
 aakhri sawaal ye, ki sahab, jab nasik se hi pyaaj kharidni thi to nafed bhi to yahi suzav april se aapako de rahaa tha

 bataa den, chandra nai dilli main ek kaarykram main media karmiyon se baat kar rahe the
 We on the benami properties Sanjidachandra said - The benami properties are being investigated seriously

 kai aatanki sanghathanon ko panaah dene vaale pakistan ne bhi maan liya he ki lashkar-e-taiyaba (jamaat-ud-daawa) kaa sansthaapak hafiz mohammad said unke liye boj he
 However, Hafiz Mohammad Sayeed did not like this
 usne yah bayaan jari karne vaale pakistan ke videshmantri khwaja asif ke khilaaf manahani kaa mukadmaa darj karvaa diya he
 a defamation claim of Rs 10 crore was filed
 mumbai aatanki hamale ke mastermind hafiz said ne use america kaa darling bataane par yahamukademaakia he
 Hafiz's lawyer a
 ke
 Dogar has sent a notice to the foreign minister
 is notice main kaha gaya he ki said kaaphi dharmik or sachche musalmaan ke taur par sammanit hai
 Saeed never went near the White House, the matter of eating and drinking is far away
 yah jaanakar hairaani hui ki mere desh ke videsh mantri khwaja asif hafiz said par sharaab pine kaa aarope laga rahe hai
 Such a statement can never be used against my client
 aapako bataa den ki asif ne neuyork main asia sosaeti seminar ke dauraan america ko bhi aade haathon liya tha or kaha ki kuch saal pehle washington aise logon ko 'darling' maanata tha
 Earlier, the Foreign Minister of Pakistan had said that it is very easy to say that Pakistan is supporting Haqqani, Hafiz Saeed and lashkar-e-taiba
 lekin wo desh ke liye boj he or hamane pehle bhi kaha he yah hamaare liye boj he, lekin hamen is boj ko dur karne ke liye thodaa vakt dijie
 The External Affairs Minister said that we do not have sufficient means to reduce this burden
 khwaja asif ne aage kaha tha ki paak ko hakkaani or hafid said ke liye doshi mat teharie
 These people were your special 20 to 30 years ago
 unki white house main khatirdaari kii ja rahi thi or ab aap pakistan ko darkinar karte hai, kyonki aapkaa kahana he ki ham inhen panaah de rahe hai
 Pakistan is trying to give no exemption to Hafiz, so that it does not bring further slander
 pakistan ke punjab praant ke adhikariyon ne hafiz said kii najarbandi ek maheene ke liye badha di he
 Pak says that its activities are a threat to peace in the country
 bataa den ki jamaat-ud-daawa kaa pramukh said is varsh 31 janvari se najarband he
 This is the reason why Hafiz, who shelters terrorists and instigates them in the name of Jihad and sent them to India, has turned against the Government of Pakistan
 pakistan videsh mantri ko bheje gaye notice main kaha gaya he ki hafiz ek rashtrabhact islam se pyaar karne vaala muslim he
 In this case, the statement of the Foreign Minister is defamatory and he could face 5 years in jail and fine under section 500 of the Pakistan Penal Code
 hafiz ke vakil ke mutabik is bayaan se aatanki sargan ke izzat ko thes pahunchi he or un par keechad oochhaalane kii koshish hui he
 In this case, Hafiz demands action
 aise main yah 14 dinon kii notice videsh mantri ko bheji ja rahi he
 In such a situation, my client Hafiz has demanded a fine of Rs 10 crores to harm his reputation not only in Pakistan but worldwide
 saath hi is saare mukademon kaa kharch bhi videsh mantri ko uthaanaa hoga
 Earlier, US President Donald Trump also criticized Pakistan for supporting the group of terrorists
 trump ne kaha ki pakistan karodon rupee madad le rahaa he, lekin usne aatankiyon ko madad karnaa jari rakhaa he
 Let us tell you that in June 2014 the Jamaat ul Dawa was declared a terrorist organization by the US
 hafiz kii giraftaar par 1 karod dollar kaa inaam bhi he

 unhone kaha ki pakistan kii aisi kyrana harkaton kaa bharat ne pehle bhi jawaab diya he
 It will also get a suitable answer
 pakistan ke har sawaal kaa jawaab dene ke liye hamaari sena sakasham he
 Angry for revenge, the country is angry with the BSF jawan's vandalism from Pakistan
 aam logon ke saath-saath tamaam raajnneeti dal modi sarkaar se pakistan ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang kar rahe hai
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has tweeted and directly sought answers from Prime Minister Narendra Modi

 On Monday, political parties sitting in opposition called for a shutdown to protest the rising prices of petrol and diesel
 vahiin band ke dauraan desh mempetrolki keemten lagaataar badhati raheen
 On Monday, the price of petrol in the capital Delhi increased by 23 paise to cross the level of 80 rupees for the first time
 maharashtra main petrol kii keemat 87
 77 rupees
 gauratlab he ki maharashtra main petrol kii keemat 90 rupee prati litre ke manovaigyanik str ke behad kareeb hai
 Actually, if the price of petrol in the country can break the Rs 90 level
 global market main lagaataar kachche tel kii keemton main oochaal dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 On the one hand, due to the purchase of expensive crude oil, the central government is spending more money than its treasury, while the prices of petrol and diesel in the country are constantly skyrocketing
 rupee main aaj bhi giravat, dollar ke mukaable 72
 In order to control the prices of petrol and diesel in the domestic market in such a situation, if the central government and all the state governments together make big cuts in their tax, then the prices can be controlled
 lekin is kadam se donon kendra or rajya sarkaron ko apane rajasav kaa ek bada hissaa ganvaane padegaa
 Where the state governments will have to face financial crisis in running public welfare policies in the states by cutting their VAT
 vahiin kendra sarkaar ko dohari maar padegi
 In the global market, ever increasing prices of crude oil cost more dollars
 jaaniye, congress ke aaj ke band se desh ko kitne kii lagegi chapatahaalanki kendra sarkaar or rajya sarkarein is sambhaavna ko nakaar chuki hai ki vah jald petrol or dijal ko jiesti ke daayre main laaenge
 But the special thing is that in the current situation, if the prices of petrol and diesel are seen under GST, then 87 in Mumbai in one stroke
 77 rupee prati litre bik rahaa petrol lagbhag 12 se 15 fisadi sasta ho jayega
 At the same time, the price of petrol in Delhi can be reduced by about 9 percent if you look at the tax range of 28 and 18 percent of GST
 rajyon dwaara waite main katautee se kam hue petrol kii keemat ko or sasta karne ke liye kendra sarkaar bhi apneexisetax main bhi maamuli katautee kii ja sakati he
 At the same time, if the price of diesel is given at the second and third tax rate given in GST, then the price can be kept in the range of 50 rupees by reducing the price of diesel by 8 to 10 percent

 '' bataa den, anupam kher kii jindagi utaar-chadhaav se bhari rahi he
 Today he is one of the most talented and versatile actors of Bollywood
 pichley dinon ek intervyuu main anupam kher ne kaha tha ki agar unki byopic banegi to blockbster rahegi
 The actor had said- "I think my biopic will be the biggest blockbuster, but i haven't thought about it
 mujhe lagata he ki ek byopic ko preranadayak honi chahie or meraa jivan kai tarah ke draamon se bharaa hua he

 '' The party and the government are stunned at the bumper victory of the BJP in Uttar Pradesh's civic elections but opposition parties are interpreting these election results differently
 nagar nigamon main 46 fisadi siten jeetne vaali bijepi ko nagar palika or nagar panchayat main 15 fisadi siton par hi jeet mili he
 The special thing is that in the Municipal Corporation, where voting was done from evms, ballot papers were used for voting in Nagar Panchayat and Palika
 vipakshi dal khaskar samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh akhilesh yadav or bahujan samaaj party supremeo mayawati isi par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 Targeting the BJP, BSP supremo Mayawati lambasted the BJP, saying that the BJP had molested evms in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections to the assembly elections
 nikaay chunaav main bhi bijepi par iviem se chhedchhad kaa aarope lagaate hue mayawati ne kaha ki agar is baar bijepi EVM se chhedchhad nahin karti to hamaare or bhi meyar jitate or siten bhi zyada milti
 He challenged that if the BJP elects from ballot paper instead of EVM, then under no circumstances can it gain power
 mayawati kii tarah akhilesh yadav ne bhi bijepi or iviem ke mudde ko uthaaya
 Akhilesh tweeted that BJP won just 15% seats in ballot paper areas but in EVM areas it won 46% seats
 saaf he ki akhilesh bhi bijepi kii jeet ko kahin na kahin iviem se jod rahe hai
 BJP has only won 15% seats in Ballot paper areas and 46% in EVM areas
 — Akhilesh Yadav (@yadavakhilesh)december 2, 2017chunaav nateezon par bolte hue mayawati ne kaha ki dalit samudaay ke alaava samaaj ke savarna or pichde varg ne bhibiespi ko samarthan diyaor yah party ke liye achche sanket hai

 Really awesome
 jinhen dhundha gali-gali
 She met in Delhi
 kamaal he hani
 You are Police Haryana, UP, Bihar
 
 Nepal
 
 Rajasthan and not know where she was looking for and she is visiting the capital in Burka
 vaise is burke ne police kii thodi bahut laaj bachaa lee
 Now the police have to say that in Delhi, the burqa of each one will be lifted and see who is inside
 But looking at Honey's maneuver, how can anyone believe that the Khatoon burqa seen in CCTV is really Honey? So we have investigated this truth in some special ways
 badahavaas kadam
 Restless breath
 dari hui nazar
 Who is this who steals eyes? kahin ye wo to nahin
 Whom police in Haryana
 phir upi, bihar, nepal or rajasthan main dhund chuki he
 White salwar gray coat and black scarf
 haathon main file or purse
 Regarding those pictures captured on CCTV, his lawyer is claiming that the video belongs to him
 sisitivi main ye record us vaqt hua jab agrim zamaanat ke kaagazat par sin karne ke liye haniprit lajpat nagar main apane vakil ke daftar main pahunchi thi
 Honeypreet's expressions
 uski chaal dhaal bahut baariki se parakhiye
 Because this will testify as to whether this woman recorded in this Lajpat Nagar CCTV is Honeypreet
 footage main dikh rahi mahila chalane ke dauraan apane baayen haath ko puraa aage or peeche kii taraf le ja rahi he
 At the same time we have the reels and real footage of Honeypreet's walk
 usamen bhi jab haniprit chalate hue dikh rahi he
 Even then his left hand is going full front and back
 haav bhav ke baad agar aap haniprit ke chalane ke tareeke par gaur karenge
 
 to paaenge ki jab wo chalati he to lambey-lambey kadam kaa istemaal karti he
 Whether it is slow or fast
 sisitivi footage main dikh rahi mahila kii chaal par bhi gaur kiijie
 His long steps are pointing this way
 magar is ko sach maanane se pehle kuch or zaruri padtaal baaki hai
 There is no doubt that Honeypreet specializes in disguise and Mujahira has done this in response to Baba's film Hind Ka Neapak
 jisamen akele hi 21-21 role ko adaa kar haniprit ne sab ko dang kar diya tha
 But during a role in this film, Honeypreet played the role of such a woman
 jiske liye usne burka pahana
 The coat was styled scarf
 thik vaisaa hi jaisapulice ko mili sisitivifootage main nazar aa rahi mahila ne pahan rakhaa he
 The woman seen on CCTV and Honeypreet are the most important and most important to prove one
 uskaa purse
 The color of her purse is not understood in the footage, but it is large in size
 panchkula kii un tasveeron par gaur karenge to paaenge ki hani ne yahaan bhi gulabi rang kaa ye bada sa purse le rakhaa tha
 Not only here but whenever Honeypreet is seen carrying a purse, the style of her purse is something similar
 to kya ye maan liya jaae ki sisitivi main dikh rahi mahila or haniprit kii style ek jaisi he
 Was Honeypreet really found in seven states and two countries, she was hiding in the capital
 or agar aisa he to vaaki ek kamaal he baba kii hani
 Who has kept his entire police force alone for a month

 The CWC said that it would stand with the people of the state and fight against the 'divisive agenda' of the BJP
 congress ne apane varisht padaadhikariyon kii baithak us vakt bulaai he jab party ke kai netaa anuchhed 370 (article 370) par sarkaar ke kadam kaa khulkar samarthan kar chuke hai
 The new and prominent name in it is that of senior leader Jyotiraditya Scindia
 sindhiya ne sarkaar ke kadam kaa samarthan karte hue mangalvaar ko kaha ki yah rashtrahit main liya gaya nirnay he
 By the way, before Scindia, several party leaders including Dipendra Hooda, Milind Deora, Anil Shastri, Ranjit Ranjan and Aditi Singh have supported the move of the Narendra Modi government on Jammu and Kashmir
 duusari taraf, congress kaa aadhikarik rukh is kadam ke virodh main he
 It alleges that the government has not followed constitutional procedures
 party ne sansad main vidheyak kaa virodh kiya he
 Bhubaneswar Kalita, the chief whip of the Congress in the Rajya Sabha, relinquished his membership of the Upper House on this issue
 darasal, unase party ne vidheyak kaa virodh karne ke liye sabhi sadasyon ko ek vip jari karne ko kaha tha

 "when he was reminded that he is a Congress leader, he replied," i am a Hindustani
 '' unhone ise aitihaasik faisla bataaya or logon se ise raajnneetik rang nahin dene kii apil kii
 Meanwhile, sources said that it is understood that the top leadership of the Congress is upset with the remarks of the party's leader in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary, in which he questioned the internal subject matter of Jammu and Kashmir and said that it should be monitored by the United Nations

 State Congress Vice President Ghanaram Sahu resigned, and now he is going to join BJP
 somvaar ko amit shah kii maujuudagi main ghanaaraam sahu bijepi main shaamil honge
 Earlier, another executive president of Congress and sitting MLA from Tanakhar Assembly seat Ramdayal Uike left the Congress and joined the BJP a month ago
 ghanaaraam sahu ne congress chhodane se pehle pisisi chif bhupesh baghel or saansad tamradhvaj sahu par sangeen aarope lagaaya he
 They have said that they are harassing and neglecting not only them but the Sahu society
 unhone apane istife main likhaa he ki wo paanch saal se party ke upaadhyaksh hai, lekin ab party main unki koi puch nahin hoti or naa hi unhen koi jimmedaari di gai he
 Accusing Tamradhwaj Sahu, he said that after cutting the b form of a woman candidate from Durg Rural, she is contesting on her own seat
 ghanaaraam sahu ne kaha ki kabhi bhi party kii taraf se unase kisi bhi tarah kii koi baat nahin kii gai
 He has not even been asked
 lihaaja wo congress main nahin rahanaa chaahate hai
 Chhattisgarh: Congress or BJP, who will get the lead in the 18 seats of the first round? Ghanaram Sahu has twice been the president of undivided fort, which also included Balod and Bemetara district
 ve 1972 main nirdaleey chunaav jite the
 But after losing to BJP twice in a row, he was marginalized in Congress politics
 varsh 2003 or 2008 main gunderdehi kshetra se congress kii ore se ve chunavi maidan main utre the
 This time too, he had sought a ticket from Gundradehi or Durg assembly seat
 yahaan tak kii unhone gunderdehi vidhansabha seat se naamakan farm tak kharid liya tha
 But when the ticket was not received, they whipped the Congress leaders fiercely
 haalanki unke bijepi main pravesh kii ummid kisi ko na thi
 On the other hand, Congress spokesperson Ramesh Varlyani expressed his reaction about his BJP entry, saying that his departure will not make any difference
 unhone kaha ki congress party ne sahu samudaay ke aadha darjan ummidavaaron ko chunavi maidan main utaara he
 This does not raise the question of neglect of this community
 ramesh varlyani ne kaha ki unki party ne jeetne yogya ummidavaaron ko tikat diya he
 After the first time rjd's sweep in Bihar and the defeat of the alliance, the rhetoric has started
 argedy ke varisht netaa raghuvansh prasad singh ne vaishali seat se chunaav haarane ke baad pradesh main karaari haar ke liye lalu kii gairmaujuudagi ko vajah bataate hue choti partiyon ke ekikaran kii vakaalat kii he
 At the same time, Lalu's special Pataliputra parliamentary constituency, Ramkripal Yadav, who was elected for the second time and Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, described it as the beginning of the end of dynasty
 singh ne kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav main argedy ke haar kii sabase badi vajah party supremeo lalu prasad yadav kaa jail main hona he
 Because of his jail time, the BJP in Bihar succeeded in his plan
 unhone ishaaron-ishaaron main yah bhi kah diya ki endie se takkar lene ke liye mahagathbandhan banane se behatar hota ki keval ek party maidan main chunauti dene ke liye hoti
 Raghuvansh said that all the regional parties of Bihar will have to form a party together, only then it can be possible to defeat Modi
 gauratlab he, agle saal ke ant main bihar main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 In such a situation, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh's statement was seen as a message for parties like Hindustani Awam Morcha, Rashtriya Lok Samata Party, Vikas Insan Party
 ramkripal yadav ne argedy ke parivaar tak simtane ko argedy kii haar kii sabase badi vajah bataaya
 Yadav said that there was a time when there was talk of social justice in RJD but now there is talk of family justice
 argedy main lalu parivaar ke sadasyon ke alaava koi cheharaa nahin he
 It has remained only a family party with every member being a minister, MP or MLA
 kendriya mantri or patna sahib ke navnirvaachit saansad ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki in nateezon ne sabit kar diya he ki viraasat or vanshavaad kii raajnneeti ab samaapt ho gai he
 World Bank reduced the economic growth rate estimate for India to 4 in the current financial year

 isi survey se yah bhi spasht hua ki pichley chah maheene main bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kii ore se pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ghoshit kiye gaye gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi internet par sabase zyaada search kiye gaye hai

 Search data also shows that four out of the top 10 most searched politicians in the country are from Congress, while only two BJP leaders are in this list
 na keval 42 fisadi matadaata asamanjas main dikhe balki yah bhi ujagar hua ki zyaadaatar matadaata vot dene ke liye sthaneey ummidavaar ko utana hi mahatvapurn maanate hai jitna ki kisi raajnneetik dal ko
 Only 11 percent of voters believed that the prime ministerial candidate of any party would also play an important role in their decision
 google india dwaara kiye gaye is survey main 108 chunaav kshetron ke saat hajaar internet yujar se sawaal puche gaye
 It is believed that through this sample, about 20 percent of the 543 seats in the country can be estimated

 About half of the people believe that there is not enough information about these people on the Internet
 logon kaa maananaa he ki jin raajnneetigyon kii internet par maujuudagi he ve zyada pragatisheel or paardarshee hai
 Two-thirds of voters have pulled back from doing so after some recent incidents of being caught in a crisis with posts posted on social media

 comjavexa akhtar kaa kavita sangrah tarkash varshon pehle aayaa tha
 
 kurratulain haidar ne isaki bhoomika likhi thi
 Javed has also said ghazals and najmas too, but his magic was performed in nazmas; As time goes by, i remember that room, the journey of a pawn, my vagabond, hunger, Mother Teresa Goya became his trademark
 lekin ye na
 The Jadid (modern) is quite different from the tradition of Najm which was run by Nun Mim Rashid, Miraji and Akhtarul Iman, or which was associated with Majaz, Jan Nisar Akhtar, Mashdoom, Ali Sardar Jafri and Kaifi Azmi
 javed ke nae sangrah main choti-badi har tarah kii najmen hai
 One thing that attracts them repeatedly is their mental curiosity or thinking and contemplation
 unka chintan kisi samasya kii vaastaviktaa ko parakhnaa, jatil or baarik gutthiyon ko suljhaana, brahmad ke rahasyon ke saath-saath maanviya aatma or jivan ke bhed ko paane kaa prayaas he
 What is this game, Kayanat, strange story, Banyan, time and time, one more thought
 The curiosity of values in all these religions reflects the mindset that tries to find the secrets of life or to know the secrets
 duusari baat yah ki aam taur se najmon kii rachana main javed chote-chote misaron se kaam lete hai
 It is not that he did not write in long books (verses)
 bahut-si gajalen lambii jameenon main bhi hai, lekin na
 They divide the pieces into pieces that, in their sequential subjectivity, go down layer by layer to create poetry with full skill and sharpness
 teesri visheshta yah he ki ve sawaal par sawaal uthaate hai, chauthe yah ki in darja-ba-darja sochate hue sawaalon main ve pathak ko bhi saath rakhte hai or samvaad karte hue, panktiyon ko prashnsuchak banaate hue aage badhate hai
 Fifth and dependent point is that these no
 jmon main chintan prashnsuchak hi nahin, kahin kahin vismayik paristhitiyon se bhi udrit hota havemain sochataa hum / ye mohare kya hai / agar main samajhuun / ki ye jo mohare hai / si
 Rf are wooden toys / so winning is what to lose
 najm kaa sheershak he ye khel kya he
 As she progresses, it is known that it is not about chess but about the game of life
 yah jeet-haar jindagi kii samasyaon kii he
 Chess is only a curtain
 kaaynaat aisi hi ek or girah dar girah rahasyamayi najm he
 The spread of the vast universe from one end to the other which is infinite, is a mystery that is considered a routine and usually passes through human consciousness
 lekin darshanik, sadhu-sant, vidwaan sab is rahasyamayi samasya se jujhate rahe hai
 Javed's curious vision here explores every scene, thinking and questioning the reader's understanding, perception, wonder, and amazement with the dialogue: how many centuries have i lived / this kyanaat and its vousayat / all my surprise All the wonder / What is this spectacle, what is the same
 
 
 jise samajhate hai ham falak he / ke jisamen jugnu kii shakl main / hajaaron suraj pigal rahe hai
 
 
 And finally again the question of the question is / is there any land beyond / there is a plank / if not / then how far is 'no'
 chintan se paripurna swar or soch kii dhar choti na
 It is also found in Jm
 in na
 Problems and questions are different
 magar bauddhik jigyaasa, kuch sochane-khojane kii lagan or prashnsuchak samvaad main pathak ko aatmavibhor karne kii style vahi he
 Strange case is, Banyan, Shuda Hafiz, Tear, Tongue are compelled to make such a living thinking
 ajeeb qissa he jitani maanviya sambandhon par he, utani is samasya par bhi he ki idial yaa manzil ko paane kii daah, uski tadap or khoj main he, kamyaabi main nahin
 Sometimes success and satisfaction also become synonymous
 bargad upnagareey samskruti kii yaaden taaja karata he ki har cheez jyon kii tyon he, mode bhi, log bhi, raste bhi lekin gaanv main apnaapan or thandak kii ek chhaanv thi jo vakt ke chakravyuuh main kho gai he jisko waapas nahin laayaa ja saktaa
 Javed's ghazals are equally reflective and touching
 ghazal kaa har sher ikai hota he lekin kuch gajalon main bhi silsilewar vidha ko apanaaya gaya he
 While the rhythm of the same sentimentality is slow in them, there is also a sense of intellectual thinking and schism that is in the nadams
 ghazal kii sanketikta main darshanik parampara kaa apana sthaan he par yahaan bhi javed kaa andaaj alag he
 Often, curiosity, contemplation is also found in them, which keeps their special enjoyment
 is sangrah kii antim najm ped se lipati bel kii ginati javed kii atisamvedansheel najmon main karata hum
 It has the same metaphorical situation of contemplation and curiosity, the same small erasure, the same wonder and question environment, which holds the status of his creative signature
 bel to ped kii ek daal se lipati maamuli-si cheez he
 The scent and color of the tree dissolved in it, and instead it became part of the tree's existence
 ped ke bare main yun to sau afsane the, bel kaa koi zikr nahin tha
 Then how does Bell handle the entire existence of the tree in his arms, the support of his life? The vine is now in his arms / The tree is handled / Slowly / On the wounded branches / The leaves are coming again / Slowly / The new roots are broken / And are coming deep into the earth / Like bells / Little flowers of a new smile bloom
 Huh
 is kavita main jindagi kii nishthurataa or niraashaa ko aashaa main badal dene kaa manjar he
 But who is this tree and who is this vine, which is a metaphor of hope and despair and an indicator of pervasion
 yah bel lipati hui bhi is prakaar he ki alag nahin kii ja sakati
 It is necessary to indicate that there is no storm of sentiment in Javed's poetry
 yahaan josho-shrosh kii aandhiyaan nahin
 There is lava, fire and sparks that we are seeing, but not the single romanticism whose intensity and superficiality made the poetry of some famous poets into a quagmire of emotions
 ped se lipati bel darasal jamaane kii tundo tej aandhiyon se juujhati or jindagi or rango-nur kaa sanket karti rachanaatmakataa he, jiske sahare jindagi aage badhati rahi he
 Now of the sun
 fee aage nikal aayaa he
 Tree thunderstorms and thou
 phanon ko jhel chukaa he
 It is the bell of inner creativity and contemplation contemplating the rest, holding the tree in the arms
 yah har manzil par ped ke saath ugti or failati rahi he
 Today, if there is color-noor in it, then it is auspicious sign for everyone, not just the tree

 But the thing that amazes me the most is how such a young man (sachin) can be so powerful
 'sachin tendulkar ne kaha, '2007 world cap sambhawatah mere kariyar kaa sabase bura daur tha
 The game that showed me the best days of my life was also showing me the bad days
 us samay bhartiya cricket ke aasapaas bahut sari chijen ho rahi thim, jo bilkul bhi acchhee nahin thi
 We needed some changes and i felt that if these changes did not happen then i am going to quit cricket

 The UPA government, which had been in power for 10 years, suffered a crushing defeat in the last Lok Sabha election and the bjp-led NDA government came to power
 narendra modi desh ke pradhanmantri bane or satta main aate hi unhone congress mukt bharat kaa sapana dekha jo saakaar hota bhi dikh rahaa he
 But the question of why the Congress lost in 2014 was answered by the then Congress President Sonia Gandhi at the India Today Conclave held in Mumbai
 sonia se jab puch gaya ki 2014 ke chunaav ke baad congress ko lagaataar haar kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Apart from this, BJP has formed its government in many states
 is par sonia gandhi ne kaha ki 10 saal tak hamaari sarkaar satta main rahi or 2014 main use satta virdohi lahar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Perhaps the leadership of the people wanted and this was a major reason for our defeat
 congress kii purv adhyaksh ne kaha ki 2014 ke chunaav main jis tareeke kii marketing narendra modi kii ore se kii gai ham uskaa saamana nahin kar paae
 He said that he will try to fight it in the future and is confident that the Congress party will return again in 2019
 iske alaava sonia ne kaha ki bijepi kii tarah sebhrashtachar ke muddeko bhi badha-chadhaakar pesh kiya gaya
 He recently cited the decision of the AAP to g case and said that it is clear from this case how the Congress was misinformed
 saath hi unhone jaanch agenciyon kii bhoomika par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki CAG ne upie ke dauraan aae maamalon ko badha-chadhaakar pesh kiya
 Will she contest in 2019? Questioned Sonia Gandhi whether she will contest in 2019 or not? In response to this question, Sonia did not refuse to contest elections in 2019

 sachin tendulkar ko is baat kaa puraa haq he ki ek puri shrunkhlaa unke naam kii jaae
 This is the reason that India and the West Indies are discussing Sachin before and just before the first match of the two-match Test series starting at the historic Eden Gardens Stadium from Wednesday
 stadium ke baahar sachin ke vishalkay katout or hording lage hai
 It is written on a hoarding - 'you have the right to dream and chase them, because dreams really come true'
 is prerak ukti ke saath bhartiya team main shaamil kai khilaadiyon ne apana kariyar shuru kiya hoga or aaj unhen bhartiya cricket ke sabase mahaan pratinidhi ke saath khilne or maidan main rahete hue unhen vidaa hote dekhne kaa mauka mil rahaa he
 Sachin will play the last Test match of his career in Mumbai from 14 November
 vahi mumbai jahaan vah paley, bade or khele, vahi mumbai jisaki aabo-hawa unke ragon main basati he
 That is why Sachin requested to play his final Test in his city, which was accepted by the Board of Control for Cricket in India
 yah ek mahaan khilaadi ko choti si bhent kii tarah he
 Before Kolkata, Sachin played his last Ranji match in Lahli, a small village in Rohtak district of Haryana
 sachin ke kaaran lahali stadium main til rakhane kii jagah nahin thi or bahut varsho baad eden main bhi buudhvaar ko yahi hoga
 65 thousand viewers are reaching Eden to join Sachin
 jab se sachin ne sanyas kii ghoshnaa kii he, bhartiya cricket main sirf unheen kii charchaa he
 The discussion of the one-day series between Australia and India did not let the discussion soften and as soon as the series ended, Sachin once again came to the center of the discussion
 ab sabaki chahat he ki sachin lahali kii apni pari ko aage badhaate hue eden main shatak jamaayen
 After failing in several innings of the Champions Trophy, Sachin lived up to expectations, scoring an unbeaten 79-run knock to give his team the victory
 kolkata ke cricket premi kabhi nahin chahenge ki sachin eden main saste main out hon, lekin yahaan kii wicket jaankaron ke saath-saath khud sachin ke liye bhi raaj bani hui he
 Apart from captain Dhoni and coach Duncan Fletcher, curator Prabir Mukherjee has not let anyone go to the pitch yet
 somvaar ko unhone rohit sharma ko pich par jane se roak diya tha
 Last year, Eden's pitch was made in a new way and since then no Ranji match has been played on this pitch
 beete maheene kii barish ko dekhte hue andaja lagaaya gaya he ki gend is pich par dhimi or nichi rahegi, lekin sachin ke paas itnaa anubhav to he ki vah pich kaa mizaaj bhaanp sakate hai
 The captain has seen the pitch but has not revealed its secret
 ab yah dekhnaa vaaki rochak hoga ki vah kis tarah ke sangyojan ke saath buudhvaar ko maidan par utarate hai? bahut sambhaavna he ki vah do tej gendbaajon or do spin gendbaajon ke saath khelen
 The spin department will remain with Ravichandran Ashwin and Pragyan Ojha but Dhoni's selection will be awaited for the fast bowlers
 sthaneey khilaadi mohammad shami ko bhi mauka mil saktaa he
 There is also no one talking about the Caribbean team amid the discussion of Sachin, who has won his last six Test matches, and who has such ardent players as Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Chris Gayle, Marlon Samuels and Darren Sammy
 saimi kah chuke hai ki vidaai shrunkhlaa hone ke naate vah sachin ko shatak kii chhot nahin de sakate or unki team to pehali hi gend par sachin kaa wicket chaahati he
 On the one hand, while Sammy and his teammates will be busy trying to get Sachin out cheaply, on the other hand crores of Indians watching the field and outside matches will be praying for Sachin's success
 ab dekhnaa he ki saikadon baar prashansakon kii prarthana par shatak lagane vaale sachin ke liye prashansakon kii prarthana antim shrinkhalaa main kitna kaam aati he
 Teams (probable): bharat : mahendra singh dhoni (captain), shikhar dhawan, murali vijay, cheteshwar pujaara, sachin tendulkar, viraat kohli, ravichandran aswin, bhubaneshwar kumaar, pragyan ojha, amit mishra, ajinkya rahane, umesh yadav, mohammad shami, rohit sharma or ishanth sharma
 West Indies: Darren Sammy, Tino Best, Darren Bravo, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Sheldon Cottrell, Narsingh Deonarayana, Kirk Edwards, Chris Gayle, Veerasemi Paramol, Kieran Powell, Dinesh Ramdin, Camar Roach, Marlon Samuels, Shane Shillingford and Chadwick Waldev

 Union Minister Kapil Sibal on Sunday said that Arun Jaitley's alleged remarks about using Hindutva as an opportunistic issue has exposed the real face of the BJP and he should apologize
 jetali ne kathith taur par kaha tha ki bhaajapa hindutv kaa upyog avasarwaadi mudde ke taur par kar rahi he
 Sibal asked senior BJP leader LK Advani and the RSS to tell the country what they now think of Jaitley
 unhone kaha ki vipaksh ke ek jimmedaar netaa kaa yah bayaan ki bhaajapa hindutv kaa upyog avasarwaadi mudde ke rup main kar rahi he, or yah bahut hi gambhir maamla he
 He said, Congress has been saying that BJP is misleading people
 ab unhen logon se maafee maangani chahie
 According to wikileaks Cable, US Embassy diplomat Robert Blake sent a message to his government after meeting Jaitley on May 6, 2005, that Jaitley said that Hindu nationalism would always be a point of discussion for the BJP
 unhone ise ek avasarwaadi mudda bataaya
 Sibal said that Jaitley should apologize to the people for such remarks and clarify why he said so
 adwani kii rath yatra ke baad desh main hue sampradayik dangon kii charchaa karte hue sibbal ne kaha ki yah avasarwaadi raajnneeti he jisamen saikadon logon kii jaan gai
 He said, this means that BJP leaders speak and do something else
 jetali ne daawa kiya he ki unhone avasarwaadi shabd kaa istemaal nahin kiya tha
 On the recent revelations of wikileaks, the Congress has retaliated on the BJP, saying that those who live in glass houses should not throw stones at another's house

 Whatever colors and ideological leanings of the governments of our country, they will all look back at Indira Gandhi
 unhone samajhadaari ke ve maanak sthapit kiye jo kisi bhi sattarudh party ke chehre kaa hissaa hone chahie
 They were created at a time when there was a great crisis for their own survival
 bharat ne bahut tarakkee kar lee he or uskaa madhyavarg khaasaa bad gaya he
 But crores of people are still living in terrible poverty or in terrible agony
 yahi vajah he ki indira kii nitiyaan ab bhi praasangik hai or unhen narendra modi sareekhe khalis congress virdohi bhi apanaate hai (bhaajapa kaa aadhikarik makasad 'congress-mukt bharat' bananaa he)
 It is time to underline what Indira's policies mean to the country
 garibi khatm karne kii nitiyon main ve upaay shaamil hone chahie jo garibon kii taatkaalik jaruraton ko puraa kar saken
 In a country where farmers depend heavily on rain for farming, where many people depend on small piece of land, a drought also becomes a question of life and death
 upyogi buniyadi dhaancha khadaa karne main kisaanon ke shram kaa istemaal karne ke liye naregaa jaisaa kaarykram congress sarkaron ne galatiyon se sikh-sikhkar viksit kiya tha
 Secondly, in political eloquence, it should always be kept in mind that there are more number of poor in the country than the rich
 aise main bhale hi vyapak nivesh or nirmaan ko protsaahan dekar aarthik vikaas ko aage badhaane ke liye kadam uthaae jaaen lekin nitigat jor hameshaa garibi ko dur karne par hona chahie
 For Indira, it was an important decision to abolish the privy purse of the dynasties as it indicated that they were ready to fight a big battle for the poor by depriving the affluent sections of their facilities
 yah vanchit tabakon ke liye maraham ke samaan tha kyonki isse unhen manovaigyanik rup se bal mila
 Indira's third point was to show that even if the leader had all the rights and powers, he would lead a simple life
 indira ke paas aalaa darje kii bauddhik sangat ke saath apni najdiki rakhane yaa dikhaane kii jitani bhi ichha yaa shishtataa ho, lekin ve vaaki ek bahut hi saamaanya tareeke se jivan bitaati thim or ve sabase zyada khush apane parivaar, khaastaur par apane poton ke saath, samay bitaane main hoti thim

 The chairs in the Rashtrapati Bhavan have been steadily growing; Modi's stature, known for his determination and steadfast decisions, has grown so much in the last six to eight months that he has proved himself dwarfing the rest of politics

 For Virat Kohli, this season of domestic T20 mahalig has proved to be forgotten till now, due to which more than his team has been the superstars
 viraat ke liye toornament kii har jeet june main landan main hone vaali champions trophy ke liye unka hausala badha sakati he, jabaki punjab ke liye ab bhi jeet ke darvaaze khule hue hai
 Virat Kohli's confidence was not lacking during practice in the nets ahead of the match in Bengaluru
 captain viraat ne abtak 7 maichon main qareeb 35 ke ausat se 3 ardhshtakon ke sahare 239 ran banaae hai jinhen yakeenan bura nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Yet, for Virat, moments of relief are seen outside the ground
 viraat in dinon apni bollywood actor dost anoushka ke saath nazar aa rahe hai jinhone 1 may ko apana 29waan janmdin manaaya he
 But the situation on the field is completely different
 teen baar final khel chuki bengalooru kii team abtak toornament main teen match bhi nahin jeet pai (11match, 2 jeet, 8 haar, 1 benatija, 5 ank) he
 Bengaluru and Virat's biggest reason for worrying is their star players
 jeniyas abi divilliars (196 ran) chotil rahe hai, bengalooru ke liye sabase zyaada 241 ran banane vaale kedaar jadhav berang dikhe hai or das hazari kris gail (6 match, 77 ran, 25
 33 average, 1 fifties)
 gail is sizan is gharelu toornament ke jitani jaldi ho sake biit jane kii duaen maang rahe honge
 The personal figures of Pawan Negi (10 wickets in 9 matches), Yuzvendra Chahal (11 wickets in 10 matches) and Caribbean leg-spinner Samuel Badri (9 wickets in 5 matches) are certainly not as bad
 lekin gendbaazi is team kii kamazor kadi hi sabit hui he
 The comments glen maxwell or unki team ke duusare stars ko in dinon ek vigyaapan ke liye cycle kii sawari kerani padi
 His team's speed has not seen anything too fast on the field
 is team ne abtak 11 main se 4 match jite hai
 But this team is expected to reach the play offs
 isliye captain glen maxwell nets par apni team kaa dabaav kam karne kii koshish main lage dikh rahe hai
 Hashim Amla (315 runs in 8 matches) scoring a century against Mumbai, in-form Martin Guptill (73 runs in 2 matches) and captain Glenn Maxwell batting at a strike rate of 178 (193 runs in 9 matches) from Bengaluru They have the potential to win against
 punjab ke gendbaaz bengalooru ke kilaaf jitna dam dikhaaenge unki team kii kamyaabi utani aasaan sabit ho sakati he
 It is a battle of credibility for the players including the captain of Bengaluru, while a win against Bengaluru can make it a great chance for the Punjab team, who had traveled to the finals in 2014 to reach the top four
 bengalooru main hone vaale match se pehle nets main abhyaas ke dauraan viraat kohli ke aatmavishvaas main koi kami nahin dikhi
 Captain Virat has so far scored 239 runs in 7 matches with 3 fifties at an average of around 35, which certainly cannot be called bad
 phir bhi viraat ke liye raahat ke pal maidan ke baahar hi nazar aate hai
 Virat is currently seen with his Bollywood actor friend Anushka, who celebrated his 29th birthday on 1 May
 lekin maidan par halaat ekadam alag hai
 Bengaluru, who have played the final three times, have not been able to win three matches in the tournament so far (11 matches, 2 wins, 8 defeats, 1 losing, 5 points)
 bengalooru or viraat kii fikr kii badi vajahen unke star khilaadi hi hai
 Genius AB de Villiers (196 runs) is injured, Kedar Jadhav, who scored the highest number of 241 runs for Bangalore, is colorless and ten thousand Chris Gayle (6 matches, 77 runs, 25)
 33 ausat, 1 ardhshtak) ke kya kehane
 Gayle will be praying for the end of this domestic tournament this season as soon as possible
 pawan negi (9 match main 10 wicket), yuzavendra chahal (10 match main 11 wicket) or caribian leg spinner samual badri (5 match main 9wicket) ke nijee aankade beshak utane bure naa nazar aaen
 But bowling has proved to be the weak link of this team
 tippaniyan Glenn Maxwell and the other stars of his team had to ride a bicycle these days for an advertisement
 unki team kii raftaar maidan par bhi kuch zyaada tej nahin dikhaai di he
 This team has won 4 out of 11 matches so far
 lekin is team ke play ofs main pahunchane kii ummid barqaraar he
 Hence, captain Glenn Maxwell seems to be trying to reduce his team's pressure on the nets
 mumbai ke kilaaf shatak lagane vaale hashim amala (8 match main 315 ran), form main dikh rahe martin gaptil (2 match main 73 ran) or 178 ke strike rate se ballebaazi kar rahe captain glen maxwell (9 match main 193 ran) bengalooru ke kilaaf jeet hasil karne kaa madda rakhte hai
 The success of his team can prove to be as easy as the Punjab bowlers show their strength against Bengaluru
 bengalooru ke captain sahit khilaadiyon ke liye ye saakh kii ladaai he jabaki bengalooru ke kilaaf jeet 2014 main final tak kaa safar kar chuki punjab team ke liye top for main pahunchane kaa shandaar mauqaa bana sakati he

 Senior actor Naseeruddin Shah has once again brought the debate of intolerance into the headlines with his statement
 shah ne is bayaan main kaha he ki samaaj sampradayik aadhaar par itnaa bant gaya he ki unhen apane bacchon ko lekar dar lagata he
 However, many people are arguing about the authenticity of his statement
 vahiin kai logon kaa kahana he ki unke bayaan ko tod-marod kar pesh kiya ja rahaa he jisase unki chhavi ko dhoomil kiya ja sake
 People are referring to such statements which they never gave, quoting Naseeruddin Shah
 daavon ke mutabik nasiruddin shah ne ye bhi kaha ki "bharat ek ghatiya desh he, rahane laayak nahin he
 "A screenshot of DBN News is being shared by many on social media
 isamen shah ke naam se is bayaan kaa daawa kiya gaya he "bharat rahane laayak desh nahin he, main apane bacchon ko lekar chintit hum, bharat ek ghatiya desh he
 "dainik Bharat (DBN) aired this article on its website on 20 December which itself has used the same headline as is being shared through viral screenshots
 aise hi sandesh alag-alag fasebuk profiles se failaae ja rahe hai
 In some of these, it has been claimed that Shah has also said that India is a dangerous country
 india today fact check team ne apni padtaal main paaya ki dainik bharat or anya kii ore se shah kaa naam lekar jo daawey kiye gaye wo managasaint hai
 In an interview to 'caravan-e-mohabbat India' youtube channel, Shah spoke about the communal atmosphere of the country
 asal intervyuu yahaan dekha ja saktaa he
 In the interview, Shah can be seen saying, 'we have already seen that in today's India the death of a cow means more than that of a police inspector
 main apane bacchon ke liye chintit hum ki unka koi dharm nahin he
 i received religious education as a child
 ratna (shah kii patni) bhi udaar parivaar se he
 We decided not to give religious education to our children
 main apane bacchon ke liye chintit hum kyonki unako kal bheed gher kar sawaal karegi, ‘tum hindu ho yaa musalmaan?’


unke paas koi jawaab nahin hoga
 This matter does not scare me but rather annoys me
 "video main kahin bhi shah ne bharat ke khilaaf kuch nahin bolaa
 He never used the words 'cheap' or 'dangerous' for India
