 Needless to say how good the condition of government hospitals is
 kuch aspataal tothik-thaak hai
 Where there is proper treatment but there is so much crowd that it is not easy to get treatment
 kabhi ilaaj ho paata he to kabhi nahin
 Pradeep of Mainpuri, Uttar Pradesh, has been running from one hospital to another with his 18-month-old child for the last 45 days but his son is not being treated
 har jagah unhen niraash hona pad rahaa he
 If there is no doctor, then the bed is not empty
 agar kisi sarkari aspataal main 45 dinon tak bed khaali nahin hota he to phir yah chintaa kii baat he
 Pradeep's son has water in his head, which has started to affect the entire body
 ek din achaanak pradeep ke bete ko bukhaar aayaa
 After eating the medicine, the fever was cured but after a few days one leg stopped working
 pradeep jab doctor ke paas gaye to doctor ultra sound karne ke liye kaha
 Ultrasound of the head shows that there is water in Pradeep's son's head, which is affecting the whole body
 phir unhen agra yaa dilli main ilaaj karaane ke liye kaha gaya
 It was not possible for Pradeep to have treatment in Agra, so he comes to Delhi so that his son can be treated in some government hospital
 sabase pehle pradeep deen dayaal aspataal pahunche
 On August 23, Pradeep's son was admitted
 28 agast ko achaanak pradeep ko kaha jaataa he kii wo apane bete ko lekar jibi pant aspataal chale jaaen or vahaan admit karvaa len
 Because his son's treatment is not possible here, Pradeep is new in Delhi, he did not know anything about GB Pant Hospital
 unhen yah bhi pataa nahin tha jibi pant aspataal kahaan he
 Pradeep kept spending time outside Deendayal Hospital overnight and reached the hospital the next day
 jab vah apane bete ke saath jibi pant aspataal pahunche to unhen pataa chalaa ki aspataal main parchaa bananaa band ho gaya
 Because of which he had to spend the night outside GB Pant Hospital
 agali subah pradeep ne parchaa to banavaa liya lekin unke bete ko aspataal main admit nahin kiya ja sakaa
 Because there was no empty bed in the hospital
 kareeb 15 din tak pradeep aspataal ke baahar is ummid ke saath sote rahe ki unka number aa jaae or unhen bed mil jaae
 Despite running away for a month, Pradeep's son could not get a bed in GB Pant
 aspataal ke taraf se kaha gaya ki bed khaali hi nahin he
 Pradeep was told that the bed in the general ward is not empty, if he wants, he can get his son treated by booking a bed in the private ward
 privet bed kaa kiraaya roj ke 1200 rupee he or dawaai kaa kharchaa alag he
 Pradeep does not have enough money to admit his son in a private bed
 jab kahin se kuch nahin hua to pradeep, vakil ashok agarwal ke paas pahunch
 Ashok Aggarwal helps poor patients get admitted to the reserve free bed of a private hospital
 aapaki jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki aajkal privet aspataal main garib marijon ke liye kuch bed reserve rakhe jate hai
 Ashok Aggarwal sends Pradeep to a private hospital but his son could not get admission there too
 pradeep ko kaha gaya ki jab bed khaali hoga unhen bulaayaa jayega
 When Pradeep asked how long it would take, he was also told that it could take two months
 pradeep phir dobaaraa agarwal ji ke paas pahunche
 Aggarwal now sent him to another private hospital
 duusare aspataal main bhi pradeep ke haath niraashaa lagi, pehle din unhen bataaya ki aspataal main doctor nahin he aaj, duusare din unase kaha gaya ki aspataal main unke bete kaa ilaaj sambhav nahin he
 Presently Pradeep's son is getting worse
 unke bete ke sir main pani badhata ja rahaa he
 Son's weight is also rapidly decreasing
 apane bete kaa ilaaj nahin karvaa paane kii vajah se pradeep khud ko laachaar mahasoos kar rahe hai
 If there is no doctor in a hospital, then the bet is not empty
 to kya dilli ke mukhyamantri or swasthya mantri pradeep kii madad karenge
 Will somehow be able to help Pradeep's son get a bed in a government hospital in Delhi
 agar aisa ho sake to pradeep ke bete kaa ilaaj ho paaegaa

 mulaayam singh ke mutabik ramgopal ke adhiveshan bulaane se pehle unhen party se baahar kiya ja chukaa tha
 Apart from this, Mulayam argued that only the national president can call a national convention
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki mulaayam singh ne chunaav chihn cycle par daawa bhi pesh nahin kiya tha
 The Mulayam Vulnera Election Commission held here has clearly stated in its decision that according to Article 15 (10) of the party's constitution, a meeting of the National Executive must be called at least once in two months
 jabaki 25 june 2014 ke baad sapa main ek bhi rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak nahin bulaai gai
 This is clearly a violation of the party's constitution
 iske alaava party ke samvidhan kii dhara 20 ke mutabik loksabhaa chunaavon or vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye tikat vitaran par faisla sirf or sirf saat sadasyeey sansadeey board hi le saktaa he
 The parliamentary board did not hold a meeting before the list released by the then national president of the party Mulayam Singh Yadav in view of the UP elections
 yah bhi party ke samvidhan kaa ulanghan hi he
 This was the logic of the Mulayam faction - the party's founder Mulayam Singh Yadav said that now whatever the election symbol is, the candidates will contest the elections whose tickets will be issued by their signature
 mulaayam singh yadav ne daawa kiya ki ye maamla unke baap-bete ke bich main he, bete ko kuch logon ne bahaka diya
 He did not name Ram Gopal Yadav, but said a lot in gestures
 -isse pehle mulaayam singh yadav amar singh or shivpal yadav ke saath chunaav ayog pahunche the
 Citing the party constitution in the Election Commission, he claimed that he is the only member of the Samajwadi Party's national president, Akhilesh Camp
 -mulaayam ne chunaav ayog se kaha ki party ke samvidhan ke mutabik rashtriya adhiveshan main rashtriya adhyaksh ko hataaya nahin ja saktaa he
 It is mandatory to give notice at least 30 days in advance to call a national session, which was not followed
 -mulaayam gut ne kaha ki rashtriya adhyaksh chunane kii ek prakriya he, jiskaa paalan nahin kiya gaya
 Ramgopal Yadav was already removed from his post
 lihaaja wo koi rejolution nahin laa sakate
 His announcement of joining the party was made only through Twitter, which cannot be accepted
 -sabase mahatvapurn baat ye ki adhiveshan main mulaayam singh yadav ko hataane kaa koi prastaav nahin laayaa gaya tha
 Hence, there is no justification for choosing a new national president
 akhilesh camp jinke samarthan kaa daawa kar rahaa he, chunaav ayog unka physical vairiffication karwaae
 The government is increasingly considering a new law for minors
 juvenil justise bill kii copy mantriyon ke samooh ke paas vichaar ke liye bheji gai he, jisamen 16 saal se upar ke naaballigon ke liye balaatkaar jaise aparaadh par kathor sajaa kaa praavdhaan he
 The Modi government is set to introduce the minor justice bill in this session of Parliament
 mahila or bal vikaas mantri menka gandhi ne loksabhaa ko bataaya he ki ki naaballig nyaay yani juvenil justise act ko vichaar ke liye mantriyon ke samooh ke paas bheja gaya gaya he
 The new bill advocates harsher punishment under the special provision for minors above 16 years of age for rape

 notebandi kii vajah se videshon se bharat ghoomane aae paryatakon ko bhi khaasi dikkat ho rahi he
 500 and 1000 notes are not running and on the other hand the fixed limit of exchange has made foreign tourists unhappy

 zyaadaatar ke paas paise khatmaho chuke hai or wo exange seemaa jitne paise nikaalkar hi kaam chalaa rahe hai
 Some were so upset that the Indian government's move was heavily criticized

 Your home and family are here, but what about them? However, in the strict atmosphere of demonetisation, there are some shopkeepers who are trying to help tourists by lending to them despite being foreign

 Anyway, any video of Sapna Choudhary goes viral and something similar has happened this time too
 sapana choudhary ke dance ke samay vahaan maujuud darshak unhone fom camere main kaid karne kii koshish kar rahe the
 Sapna Chaudhary is known for her desi style and in this video she is getting the same style
 a post shared by DESI QUEEN (@isapnachaudhary) on Feb 6, 2019 at 11:59pm pstsapana choudhary (sapna Choudhary) ke dance ko desh sahit videshon main bhi log khub pasand karte hai
 Sapna Chaudhary's popularity can be gauged from the fact that she is being called for dance performance from different parts of the country
 haal hi main sapana choudhary haal hi main bihar, punjab, uttarakhand, madhya pradesh sahit kai rajyon main dhamaakedaar dance parformens deen
 After 'bigg Boss', his success graph continued to rise
 sapana choudhary bollywood main bhi film 'dosti ke said effects' se dhamal machaa chuki hai
 Overall, this dance video of him has created a boom
 brihanmumbai mahanagarapalika (biemasi) main mili karaari haar ke baad maharashtra kii raajnneeti main raaj thakare or unki party maharashtra navnirmaan sena(manase) par sankat ke badal madraate dikh rahe hai
 The party has got only seven seats in the BMC election
 yah chunaav manase ke liye apane duubate hue raajnneetik astitv ko bachaane kii ladaai thi
 Is Raj Thackeray's existence in danger? After the crushing defeat at BMC, the discussion is hot that Raj Thackeray's political existence is in danger
 isamen koi do raay nahin he ki pichley kai chunaavon se party ko jabardast haar kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Yet it is too early to say that Raj Thackeray's existence is in danger
 raajnneeti main koi bhi party hameshaa shaktishaalee nahin rahati
 The stature keeps on increasing
 haalanki yah bhi ek sachai he ki agar raaj thakare apni raajnneeti or raajnneeti karne ke tareekon main badlaav nahin karte to aage kii raah mushkilon bhari ho sakati he
 Is the melody of 'marathi manush' not working? In 2006, Raj Thackeray formed his own party MNS after splitting from Shiv Sena
 raaj thakare ne apni party kaa mukhya agenda 'munmbai, marathiyon ke liye’ ko banaaya
 Party workers targeted people from all over Mumbai to earn a living from North India, especially Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
 sambhav he ki raaj thakare ne sochaa ho ki wo is bhaavnaatmak mudde ke sahare baaki partiyon ko aasaani se haraa denge or satta ke kareeb pahunch jaaenge lekin vastav main aisa hua nahin
 On the contrary, the party suffered election-by-election losses
 pichley salbiemasi chunaavamein 28 siten jeetne vaali masase is baar ke chunaav main 7 siton par simat gai
 The MNS, which won 13 out of 288 seats in the 2009 assembly elections, was reduced to one seat in the 2014 elections and the party candidates for 203 seats were forfeited
 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main party ne 288 main se 218 siton par apane ummidavaar utaade the
 All these figures are pointing to the fact that the voters of Mumbai and Maharashtra are not liking the party who sing the voice of 'marathi manush'
 ab yah sochakar ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin ki agar ganje ho gaye to kya hoga
 Scientists have found a new way to grow hair from stem cells

 Poet Om Nischal, critic of an exclusive talk at his house for Sahitya Aaj Tak on the 96th anniversary of the famous poet, narrator, prose writer Ramdarash Mishra of our era
 -jo samay biit gaya he, jisase hokar aap gujarey hai, jiske aap drashtaa or bhokta rahe hai, use aap aaj kis tarah dekhte hai?mere samay ke do hisse hai
 Part of it is when i was ever active in traveling, traveling and even used to attend seminars and meetings and used to meet and visit many litterateurs of my time
 to un dinon kaa meraa anubhav he ki vah bada acha samay tha
 In those days, there were good poets and prose writers, there was a great brotherhood among them
 ek paariwarikta thi
 i was in Model Town, at that time good writers, new writers had come from many places and there were seminars
 log ek-duusare ko sunate saraahte the
 Even the big writers of the city, among them, used to come to our house
 kai bade sahityakar aae, unase baatcheet hui to mere khyaal se vah samay mujhe bahut moolyawaan lagata he
 The time before that was very beautiful when i was in Benaras
 vahaan ham nae sahityakar uth rahe the, or ek duusare se shakti praapt kar rahe the
 i can say that those seminars had a big hand in the process of our formation, which was often happening there
 ab is samay to main ghar main band-sa ho gaya hoon
 People are not able to come and go here, apart from this, what is being written right now, be it poetry or fiction, there is no opportunity to pass through it properly
 avasar to he lekin man ko vah avasar praapt nahin ho rahaa he or mujhe yah bhi lagata he ki is vakt sahityakaron ke milane-julne kaa, ek-duusare ke saath ho lene kaa paridrishy suunaa ho gaya he
 Even if the scenario is there, it is the people who belong to one ideology, that is, the mutual companionship of writers of different ideologies is no longer visible
 -in dinon ghar main hote hue bhi aap kitne sarjanaatmak bane hue hai
 Staying in poems, ghazals and diaries
 logon ke saath baithna to apane jamaane se lekar aaj tak ke saahitiyik paridrishy par baat karnaa- is sarjanaatmak sakriyata kaa kya rahasy he?jab se maine avkaash praapt kiya tab se lekar aaj tak ke samay ke kai aayam hai
 After taking leave, i became very active in my creativity
 anek kavita sangrah aae
 Many novels came
 anek kahaniyaan ai or gadhy kii anek vidhaon main bhi rachanaaen ain
 But gradually i have started feeling health-free and have limited myself only to poetry and diary writing and now that too is not possible - so many times i feel like my days are passing by
 kabhi kuch padh liya, kabhi let gaye, kabhi patni ke saath baith kar baaten kar leen
 Sometimes friends like you came and enjoyed gossip for a long time
 ab to mujhase tahalnaa bhi chhot gaya he
 i am afraid not to fall anywhere and sometimes i open my old files just like this and start passing through them
 aap yaa any sahityakaron dwaara likhi aalochanaon kaa anand lene lagata hoon
 There is a lion in my ghazal - the mind says right now it is like a youth and he says chahiyatan, if you have got enough, now keep quiet
 par mere geet kii ek pankti he:chup magar is baavare man se rahaa jaataa nahin he-to yadi kuch nahi likhata hoon to bhi man bheetar-bheetar ek sarjanaatmak swaad anubhav karata rahata he
 Despite this, every year some books come on you, some books on you
 rachanaatmak celibrasion kaa aapkaa yah rukh bahut acha lagata he?dekhie! jo kitaaben aa rahi hai, unamem se adhikansh ve hai jo meri purv sarjana par aadhaarit hai
 That is, there is nothing new in the poem if the poem comes
 likhi gayi kahaniyon kaa kahani samrugr naam se prakaashan ho rahaa he or in kahaniyon main se nai-nai kitaaben banati rahati hai; to adhikansh pustaken isi tarah kii aa rahi hai
 But like i said that i write a poem at this time, if there is any good reference, then i put it in the diary
 baatcheet ke kram main bhi main bahut kuch kah jaataa hoon, jaise aaj aapse hi baat kar rahe hai to chijen nikal rahi hai
 Now it is definitely that in the beginning the author has to find a publisher
 baad main prakaashak lekhak ke peeche pad jate hai
 At this time, with the request of many publishers, it becomes a situation to give something
 isiilie pehle kii rachanaaon main se kuch chayan karke unhen de detaa hoon
 It also happens that some gentle critics keep writing something in my praise again and again
 us madhyam se bhi meri sarjana kii chhaviyaan ubhartee rahati hai
 You are sitting in front
 munh dekhi baat hogi lekin main kahana chahta hoon ki aapane mere sahitya ko bahut antarang bhav se dekha he or bahut saghan or vistaar ke saath meri anek vidhaon kii rachanaaon par vichaar kiya he or likhaa he
 So frankly, i too get the pleasure of recognizing the importance of my creativity through you guys
 -kai shaharon main rahe
 Had to go to Gujarat for a job in Benaras to study
 phir dilli
 They have come and are left here
 par main poochhun ki in teenon main kis shahar main logon kaa sabase zyada pyaar mila jo aaj bhi aapkaa peechha karata he, to aap kya kahenge?om ji, banaras mere banane ke din the or ham nae sahityakaron kii ek mandali thi
 i have said that it was very nice for us to meet together, to attend seminars
 is silsile main main ek naam avashya loonga
 He is the brother of Thakur Prasad Singh
 unka pyaar, unki masti, logon ko or visheshtya mujhe bahut taazgi detii thi or sabase bady baat yah thi ki vahaan ham logon ko gurudev acharya hajariprasad dvivedi kaa shishyatv praapt tha
 i wanted a job to be held in Benares
 lekin niyati ko kuch or sweekaar tha
 i had to go to Gujarat for a job
 vahaan aath varshon ke nivas kii anubhuti main dukh bhi he sukh bhi he
 Sadness was initially to be established, but later Gujarat gave me a lot of love
 vahaan nausari se lekar rajkot tak ke chaatro main meri vyapti bhi ho gayi thi or jo mere chaatr nikle unhone mujhe bahut sammaan diya
 Even today, i am very fond of Gujarat
 ek baar apane priy shishy bholaa bhai patel se maine kaha ki gujarat ne mujhe bahut pyaar diya to unhone kaha ki aapane bhi gujarat ko bahut pyaar diya
 Many people from the Hindi world went there to teach, but the feeling of love from the students there is rare
 mujhe bahut garv he ki bholaa bhai patel, raghuveer choudhary, mahavir singh chouhan or anek pratibhashali chaatro kaa guru hone kaa mujhe saubhaahgya mila
 The disciples of those students' disciples are also giving me a lot of love
 ek baat bataaun aapako
 Poet Badri Narayan met at a seminar and he left immediately saying, "mishra ji, i went to Gujarat and i was stunned to see the love there for you
" '' vahaan se dilli aane kaa man to nahin tha, kintu aana padaa; or jab main aa rahaa tha to bhai umashankar joshi ne kaha tha ki mishra ji, ''aap yahaan se ja rahe hai to hamen dukh to ho rahaa he lekin aapaki asli jagah vahi he
 Perhaps the meaning of this statement was that here we will get the support of big writers, we will get challenges, we will get facilities to print
 dilli ne shuru main to bahut takalif di lekin dhire-dhire yah bhi bha gayi or sahitya jagat main main apane ko mahasoos karne laga
 All my books were printed here
 sudhi pathakon, aalochakon, sahityakaron kii pritikar pratikriyaaon se main apane sahitya' ke mulya kii pratiti karne laga
 Here also good disciples were found, good friends met
 lekin main balpurvak kahata hoon ki aath saal ke gujarat nivas main jo pyaare shishy mili, ve dilli ke lambey nivas-kaal main nahin mil paae
 - The literature that was earlier has a value even today
 puraane lekhakon ko aaj bhi log padhate hai, sur, tulsi, kabir, premchand, bhagwaticharan verma, bachchan, amritlal nagar, shivani, dharmaveer bharti ko log aaj bhi pard rahe hai
 But what is being written today, will the subsequent generations read the same way as today's people to the old writers? The question you have asked, i ask myself constantly
 yah chaahe meri ruchi kaa sawaal ho, chaahe aaj kii meri adhyayan sambandhi udaseenta kaa sawaal ho; main baar-baar kahata hum, anubhav karata hum ki us sahitya kii seemaa nagarjun, kedarnath agarwal, bhavani prasad mishra, girija kumaar maathur, muktibodh or agyeya tak aakar ruk jaati he- jo aaj bhi padhaa ja rahaa he or kal bhi padhaa jayega
 It is true that the level of readability which is in the medieval poets or the poets between the beginning and the middle of the modern period, has also slowed down here
 maine kaha ki aaj jo kavitaayen likhi ja rahi hai unase main samyak rup se guzar nahi paata hoon
 Therefore, i am not able to say very clearly what will be left and what will be left tomorrow
 par aaj ke bahut se satahi lekhan ko dekh kar kabhi-kabhi main bhi yah sochataa hoon ki koun padhegaa bhala aise logon ko jinaki rachanaaon main vah rasayan nahin he jo pehle ke sahitya kii tarah logon ko jodta tha, conect karata tha
 Today is the era of best seller
 best riting kaa nahin, best celler banaam best riting ke bich ke badhate antaraal par kya kahenge ?main abhi pathneeyata kii jo baat kah rahaa tha us sandarbh main main yah kahana chaahunga ki katha sahitya kaa swaroop aisa hota he ki kamjor kahaniyaan or kamjor upanyaas to kuch dur tak pathak ko apane main rama lete hai kyonki unamem kathatatv hota he
 It is also true that great novels or great stories or great poems do not come continuously
 kabhi-kabhi aati hai
 Now see, what is what Shrilal Shukla wrote after 'ragdarbari'? What is what Renu wrote after Sloppy Aanchal? So great literature is in its place, but that literature also has its own importance, which, despite being not great, makes a people go through the realities of their time, their society
 jahaan tak best celler or best riting kaa sawaal he, best celler ke sambandh main do bate main kahana chahta hum
 One, who is going to investigate the book which the publication has declared as the best seller? The publisher may also declare the best seller for publicity
 kamaleshwar kaa upanyaas 'kitne pakistan' aayaa tha to prakaashak kii ore se ghoshnaa hone lagi ki yah doosraa sanskaran he, teesraa sanskaran he, chauthaa sanskaran he aadi-aadi to maine ek prakaashak se poocha ki yah sab kya he
 He said, there is also an edition by printing fifty-one hundred books, there is also an edition of three hundred books and today there are literally 300 edition editions
 to best celler kaa marm prakaashak hi samajhataa he
 Secondly, it is good to be a best seller when it is also good literature
 jaise premchand hai
 He is also a best seller and a best writer
 kintu best celler main ve tamaam kitaaben bhi aa jaati hai jo formulon se likhi gayi hoti hai or jinke pathak bahut halki phulki ruchi vaale hote hai
 So it is important to have the best writing along with being the best seller
 vahi moolyawaan he
 Many times many creations do not get the publicity as they should
 prakaashak yaa aalochak unke bare main chup rahete hai
 But they keep on gradually highlighting their importance, their worth
 main apane tai kahuun ki kabhi kisi ore se meri kriti ko best celler kii oopaadhi nahi mili lekin mujhe apane upanyaason kaa mahatv maaloom he
 i know that those novels are my time, my village, my city
 acharya hajaari prasad dvivdi ji ne mere donon upanyaason 'jal tuutata hua' or 'apane log' par likhte hue uske vishesh samay or samaaj sambandhi mahatve ko rekhaankit kiya tha
 When his people came, he had a big discussion
 kaaphi log us par bole
 But he remained absent in the eyes of some critical critics
 - praaia: lekhakon ko yah kehete suna jaataa he ki aalochana ne unke saath nyaay nahin kiya, ve upeksha kaa shikaar rahe
 What are your experiences about this? Om ji, i do not think about my neglect
 kyonki mujhe apane lekhan par bahut gaharaa vishwaas he
 i feel very full about my poetry and prose genres
 upeksha kii do dishaaen hai
 One is that certain types of people, ie those who are closed and connected in a particular ideology, do not see or discuss the works outside their party
 duusari baat yah ki kya jin rachanaaon kii upeksha kii ja rahi he ve vastav main upeksha ke yogya hai? nahin hai naa? isliye aap ke samet anek aalochakon ne meri rachanaaon kaa bahut gaharaa vivechan kiya he, unki moolyavatta kii pahchaan kii he anek samikshatmak pustaken mere sahitya par ai hai
 Nearly twenty five hundred my literature
 par shodh prabandh likhe gaye hai
 Many journals have drawn specials
 anek bhashaaon main mere upanyaason, kahaniyon va kavitaaon ke anuwaad hue hai
 Many universities are taught in different classrooms
 itani badi duniya kaa pyaar mujhe mila he, tab kuch tathakthith or apane ko bahut vishisht maanane vaale aalochakon kii parvaah koun karata he
 i would like to say one more thing in this context that i am a homegrown man by all means
 apane ko ghar main simit kar lekhan karata rahata hoon
 i avoid the race under which many people soon find something
 yah baat dhyaan dene kii he ki kuch khaas tarah ke prabhaavshaalee logon kii upeksha ke baavjood thode samay baad hi mujhe bhi apane aap bahut kuch miltaa gaya he
 You also know the part race that goes on for the award
 lekin main bahut swabhimaan ke saath kah rahaa hum ki maine kahin puraskaar yaa anya kisi laabh ke liye koi bhaag-daud nahin kii
 a lion of my ghazal is expressing this matter very well: i reached there where you reached me, but slowly
 or jab bhi mujhe sammaan mila, to anant saamaanya logon ke patr mili, phone mili, unki pritikar pratikriyaayein milin
 This is a big fund for me
 -aapaki kahaniyon evam upanyaason main jane kitni kitni tarah ke paatr va charitra aae hai
 How have you covered such a large world in your writing? i used ghar-ghura in a particular context that i do not try to get out of the house to get all the things
 main jivan jeene kii prakriya main gaanv se gujara, kasbe se, shahar se gujara hoon
 Staying in Vaani Vihar Uttam Nagar, i have gone through many dimensions of reality here
 is tarah mere anubhav kii duniya bahut badi he
 i have found that experience by living among people, i have not been able to close it at home
 isliye main ghar main rah kar bhi anant logon ke saath apane ko anubhav karata hoon
 But i avoid being with those people who keep doing the rest
 -saath uthne-baithne vaale lekhak ek ek karke chale gaye, chale ja rahe
 How does it feel that this absence of writers gradually? In fact, it is a fact of life that what comes will go
 lekin kai baar hota he ki lagaataar ek ke baad ek koi dost lekhak chalaa jaataa he to ek udaasi kii lay chhod jaataa he
 See, many of our good litterateurs, good friends have gone, leaving the pain within us
 jaise kedaar ji, namvar ji, kunwar narayan ji, prabhakar shrotriy chale gaye
 Meanwhile, many more people went - Kailash Vajpayee, Bhola Bhai Patel, Maheep Singh, Mahavir Singh Chauhan - everyone has to go
 aaj vah gaye, kal koi or jayega, lekin yah vaastaviktaa he ki logon kaa janaa shesh logon ke man par dard chhod jaataa he
 This happened once when he lived in Model Town, Delhi
 tabhi yah geet likhaa tha
 Everyone going one by one / mind feels very lonely
 jo ja rahe hai unke saath hamaara hona bhi sarthakata rakhata tha
 Those with whom they played - educated, educated, got up and sat together, they have to go not only to them, but also to all those with whom they had a relationship
 -aapaki kavitaaon main bazaar bahut aata he
 You have also done a lot on the market
 ghar main ghuste ja rahe bazaar kii ore bhi aapane aksar ishaare kiye hai
 But what can this market do for a writer like you from a village ? It is one thing to not be affected by the market even while staying in the middle of the market and it is another thing to become a market by staying in the market
 jaise shahar main rah kar shahar kaa ho janaa ek baat he lekin shahar main hokar bhi ganwai sanskaar liye chalanaa ek baat he
 i did not belong to the city by staying in the city, i did not belong to the market even while staying in the market
 lekin shahar or bazaar kii jo moolyawaan dein he use to sweekaar karnaa hi hota he
 Market is one thing, marketism is another
 bazaar main log jate the or sauda suluf kharidte the
 There were weekly markets especially in the villages, they used to wait and people used to go there and buy things for the house for a week
 aasapaas ke log paraspar milte the
 Halchal used to ask, he was happy
 to shahar main bhi apni thos aavashyaktaaon ke tahat bazaar main janaa aavashyak he; janaa hi padataa he
 But marketism is creating the need of the people by promoting many new things through advertisements and people are bringing their things to their home by bringing them
 to bazaar is rup main ghar main paith rahaa he or ghar kii maansikta ko badal rahaa he
 See, there was a kitchen in the house which was delicious and healthy
 ab bazaar ne itani tamaam chijen paros di hai ki bachche tut-tut kar unhen kha rahe hai or biimaar ho rahe hai
 So the market with its things, with its diseases, is entering the house with a new mindset and is not allowing the house to remain home
 roj mobile par dasiyon vigyaapan aate hai
 Produces the temptation of many unnecessary things
 -dow
 Saab, you have written so much
 lagbhag saat dashakon kaa lekhan kam nahin, sau ke lagbhag kitaaben
 But still there is nothing left to say? On this question Ramdarash ji remembered one of his ghazals
 itnaa likhaa, itnaa likhaa kya-kya nahin man kah gaya
 It always seemed like something else remained
 phir bole
 Om ji, the thing is that i neither lived my life by planning, nor did i write
 samay ke saath chalata rahaa jo kuch kahata rahaa, detaa rahaa, use main vyakt karata rahaa
 i have never been worried about what is left and what to say
 mujhe lagata he ki maine kavita, upanyaas, kahani ke madhyam se, nibandhon ke madhyam se or anya gadhy vidhaon ke madhyam se jo kahana tha, vah kah diya he
 That is, what you are constantly experiencing, you are putting it in your creativity
 ab kya nayaa anubhav karuunga? kal koun si nayi baat chunauti degi yah to kal jaanata he
 i do not know what to say and what is left
 kai baar aisa sawaal log karte hai mere saamne bhi ki maine jo sawaal puche hai iske baad aap kya kahana chaahate hai? to main yah kahana chahta hoon ki mere paas rachaa hua kuch nahin rakhaa he ki aapse kahoon
 Answers are not maintained
 ve to sawaal se hi nikalate hai
 The same thing has happened to me
 mujhe kya kahana or rah gaya he aisa main sochataa nahin hoon
 This means that i am not staying anywhere
 kal jo kahegaa, kahuunga
 The dynamics of creativity are in the mind
 apni vay ke shithily ke baavjood agar samay kehane ko kahegaa to vah kahuunga
 But what that tomorrow will be, i do not know
 upanyaas likh rahaa hota hoon to is prakriya main sochataa hoon ki kya likhnaa he kyon ki yah do-chaar pej kii baat to he nahin
 It is a matter of life
 use khojna pasta he, tatolna padataa he
 When i write novel, i do not sleep at night wondering what i will write tomorrow
 lekin vah prakriya main hota he
 Narrative references are explored when to add them, where to bring them
 is sandarbh main om ji ek kavita sunaaunga aapako --(ramdarsh ji ke geet kaa nayaa sanchayan aane vaala he, uski pandulipi uthaa kar ve ek geet sunaane lagate hai)chahta hoon kuch likhuun par kuch nikalataa hi nahin hadost bheetar aapke koi vikalataa hi nahin he
 Then you will write that when you go to life somewhere, you go through the happiness and sorrows of others in search of a whole light, life is not only success
 baat choti yaa badi ho, aanch main khud main jali hodusro jaisi nahin, aakaar main nij ke dhali hohai adab kaa ghar, siyasat kaa nahin bazaar yah tojuth kaa sikaa chamaacham yahaan chalata hi nahin he
 Thus, whenever i have seen and found them, i have found myself happy but felt that i am asking, what is the sorrow that hurts? khaas kar is vay main kuch chote mote rog saalte hi rahete hai
 Sometimes there is a problem in the house
 ghar main koi vyakti kuch alag apriy dhang kaa nikal jaae to dukh salata he
 But there is such a sorrow that i tell you and all the sensitive people and that sorrow is the sorrow of society
 akhbaar padhte hai, tivi dekhte hai, dekhte padhate hi dukh jaise lad-sa jaataa he
 It is a great sorrow for a sensitive person and that sorrow takes a creative form in your writing
 haal hi main meri ek kahani ai thi 'jansatta' main: 'ek achchheen khabar'
 This is the story akhbaar main ai hui buree khabaron se ladaa fandaa vyakti udhaas baitha he ki ek courier aata he
 It is a wedding invitation - a girl's wedding
 yah acchhee khabar isliye he ki vah ladki ek garib maa baap kii ladki hoti he jise uskaa maalik beemaari kii haalat main chhod aayaa hota he ek aspataal main
 When she recovers, the hospital expels her
 vah sadak par baithi ro rahi hoti he ki ek dayaalu vyakti aata he
 Takes him home
 kahata he, tum meri beti ho
 Considers him, teaches, b
 e
 Provides sab ghar vaale use maanate hai
 The same girl is getting married today
 use vah aisa athmiya sammaan detaa he to lagata he is galaajat-bhari duniya main ek aisa aadmi bhi he ki use beti kii tarah paalataa-posta he
 The character of the story thinks that why there is no place for such news in the newspapers, laden with bad news? Why don't they give such news that a man should experience the goodness of the world by reading it, man's mind should be healthy
 unase baatcheet karte dopaher ho gayi he
 i think they must be tired
 baatcheet band karata hoon ki dekhtaa hoon ki achaanak unka geetkaar jaag uthaa he
 They pick up their manuscript of the song collection and start reading a fresh song
 kehete hai om ji suniye --ek neem manjari mere angan jharikaanp rahe lohe ke dwaar
 Today, Gagan bowed down to my house, a little cloud stopped here, trembled in the sky, silence called me today
 main bhi ise unke saath gunagunaata hoon
 The mind is pleased with the rhythm of the song
 main uth chalane ko hota hoon ki ve daravaaje tak chhodane ke liye uth khadey hote hai
 They stop there and touch their feet and walk on the road and think how many experiences, how many memoirs, how much is there in the past and in this century, the Hindi writer who has traveled in this century was full
 jaise fal se ladaa hua koi vriksh
 Unbeknown to the country and familiar with the situation
 dhire-dhire bheed main kho gaya hoon par unki baatcheet, unki kavitaayen jaise bheetar goonj rahi hai

 pakistan kaa ye shahar he duniya kaa doosraa sabase pradooshit shahar, jaaniye kis number par he dilli Contrary to the government's stance, the Supreme Court ruled in August last year that if privacy was one of the fundamental rights conferred by the constitution, then it seemed that a new dawn had occurred
 varshon se sakriy kaaryakarta bhartiya vishisht pahchaan praadhikaran (yuidi) ke adhikariyon or sarkaar ke baaki mahakamon se is baat par bahes or mukademebaaji main uljhe hue hai ki aadhaar database desh or logon kii suraksha or niztaa ke liye khatra he yaa nahin
 The government's view in this entire debate has been largely that privacy is a matter of secondary concern for it, which can be considered as secondary to other needs like development
 supreme court ne puttaswami maamle main is nazariye ko khaarij kar diya or usne aazaadee or garima ke sanvaidhanik mulyon ke saath-saath vikaas ke liye bhi niztaa kii ahmiyat par jor diya
 Six months later, no concrete impact of this decision is yet to be revealed
 udhar, aisi khabaren hai ki aadhaar ke data kii chori ho rahi he or aadhaar number kaa anadhikrut istemaal ho rahaa he or iske istemaal se bank khate se farji tareeke se dhan nikaal liya ja rahaa he
 a further hearing on the grounds is pending in the Supreme Court
 ho saktaa he ki yah is maamle main antim sunwaayee ho
 But how much relief will be given is not clear and it should not be taken as a decision that the decision will be positive
 ek baat yah bhi he ki niztaa ke masale se jude baaki tamaam maamalon main supreme court ne ascharyajanak rup se us nazariye ko khaas tavajjo nahin di he jo puttaswami maamle kaa mukhya aadhaar rahaa he
 In that judgment, autonomy and decision-making have been integral to the right to privacy, so that "all individuals are able to uphold their beliefs, ideas, expressions, thinking, ideology, preferences and choice, contrary to the demand for" social homogeneity
 '' lekin lagata he ki ise us hadiya ke maamle main bhula diya gaya, jo pehle akhila thi or phir dharm badal kar islam dharm apana liya or ek musalmaan se shaadi kar lee, sab kuch apni pasand se or vah yah baat lagaataar kahati rahi
 Hadiya's father petitioned that both Hadiya's conversion and marriage were under ISIS pressure, the Kerala High Court dismissed the marriage on the grounds that the girl's parents had not agreed to the marriage and They were not present at the wedding
 supreme court ne ab tak shaadi ko radd qaraar dene vaale faisle ko palata nahin he
 Instead, in August 2017, he ordered an inquiry by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to see if the marriage was the result of a larger scheme of 'love jihad'
 adaalat ab kathith taur par aage koi karrwai tabhi karegi jab jaanch ke nateezon kaa pataa chal jayega
 The Puttaswamy judgment recognized that some reasonable restrictions could be imposed on the right to privacy
 hadiya ke maamle main ek vayask mahila ke 'nitant nijee maamle main samaaj kii apekshaaon ke khilaaf apni praathamiktaaon or vikalpon' ko tay karne ke adhikaar ko ekadam darkinar kar diya gaya
 It remains to be seen in the light of this case that if the Supreme Court sits for the last hearing in the Aadhaar case, to what extent does it give preference to the autonomy of the people and the decision making process over the needs and interests of the state
 itnaa hi nahin, hadiya kii nijee jindagi ke bare main faisla dete hue kerala hycourt ne 'parenge petrei' nyaayadhikaar kaa istemaal kiya jisamen un logon ko suraksha dene kaa adhikaar rajya ke paas hota he jo khud kii suraksha karne main naakaam rahete hai
 Generally, this jurisdiction is used in the case of minors or in the case of people with severe mental illnesses
 lekin iskaa istemaal ek puri tarah se swasth 24 saal kii yuvati ke bare main uski ichha ke vipareet aisa faisla karke court khud ko sabase bada pradhan maan baitha he
 This also brings the question of how much importance the Supreme Court gives to the government's argument in the Aadhaar case
 sarkaar kaa najariya shaayad purv atorni general mukul rohtagi ke ek daawey se saaf ho jaataa he
 During the hearing of the Aadhaar case in May last year, he had said in the court that the rights of Indians over his body are also not absolute
 vaise rohtagi kaa daawa koi ascharyajanak nahin he
 Women and many weaker sections have to face many restrictions against their will
 masalan, ve koi apni pasand kaa kapadaa pahanen yaa na pahanen, yaa ve garbhadhaaran karen yaa na karen yaa kiske liye garbhadhaaran karen yaa garbh ko jinda rahane den yaa na den
 The privacy of women has also often been very limited
 bhale hi shaareerik niztaa kii swatantraaa ko manyata mil jaae, lekin yah manyata bhi naitikta kii dharanaon or parivaar kii pratishtha kii chintaaon se nirdhaarit hoti he
 This creates an understanding about privacy, that sets the ideal of covering itself or covering itself in the private realm
 darasal, yah dharna itani aam he ki puttaswami maamle main apni raay rakhane ke liye jab justise sharad arvind bobade ne pracheen bhartiya granthon ke udhaaharan rakhe to ve bhi vaisaa hi rup le rahe the
 Obviously, both privacy and physical freedom have never been fully achieved by Indians
 darasal rohtagi ke daawey main sabase ullekhneey baat to yah thi ki aadhaar yojana ke bachaav main sarkaar isi dharna par or bal de rahi thi
 Instead of increasing the autonomy and independence of the people, the government wants to protect itself
 yah bharat main hi nahin kaha ja rahaa he ki log apane saare adhikaar kendrikrut adhikariyon ke haathon main saunp den
 The big clusters of internet industries — whether established international giants or Indian top companies or start-ups — all want us to delegate our autonomy and decision-making process to them
 yah bhi sach he ki companiyon ke aisa karne kaa nateeja sarkari jaisaa nahin hota
 After all, Facebook or Flipkart do not interfere in your life as much as the government does
 lekin donon kii mul bhaavana ek jaisi he
 Therefore, when it comes to the digital realm, a key drawback of the Puttaswami decision is that it considers cyberspace-related privacy protection to be primarily a matter of 'privacy of information' and 'data security', as it is traditional
 Is understood as lekin yah samaj paryaapt nahin hogi kyonki hamaare sharir or uski soochna ke bich jo baarik-si rekha bani hui he, vah dhime-dhime gaayab ho rahi he
 For example, news of starvation deaths can be seen after refusal to provide ration to people due to failure in Aadhaar fingerprint verification
 is tarah ke maamalon main fingerprint ke, aadhaar database se milan main naakaami kaa nateeja vaaki maut ho sakati he
 So in the case of Aadhaar, merely keeping data security at the center of traditional understanding will never succeed in preventing future curbs on physical freedom
 yahi vajah he ki aadhaar maamle kaa faisla bahut mahatvapurn he
 If the Supreme Court is holding a final hearing, then its decision will not only determine the appropriate restrictions and their limitations on the right to privacy but it will also decide how our world will be in the digital era
 kya vah aisi duniya hogi jisamen logon kii swaittata, faisla lene kii kshamta or shaareerik aazaadee ko majbootee milegi yaa phir vah duniya un tamaam vyavasthaaon se lad jaaegi jo in sari chizon ko kamatar karengi? saal 2018 is sawaal kaa bada ahm jawaab degaa

 chunaav jite jate hai vot bank se
 Aurvot bank is formed by caste, religion and region
 lekin dilli main hone ja rahavidhansabha chunaav bilkul algahai
 This is probably the first such election in the country which is being fought on the economic issues of the society
 ye chunaav he dilli ke garibon or baaki bache logon ke bich
 The poor voters of the capital are firmly with Arvind Kejriwal
 lekin unhen chhodkar baaki bache logon ke liye arvind kejariwal kii 49 din kii sarkaar keval ek majaak thi
 And a circus, which took place outside the Rail Bhawan over the Jan Lokpal Bill, ended after Kejriwal's government took over
 or inhen baaki bache logon ne kasam khai ki ve ab kabhi bhi raajnneeti kii disha badalane kaa daawa karne vaale political pide-pyper kejariwal ke kehane main kabhi nahin aaenge
 The poor section was also unhappy with Mufflerman
 kyonki unhone jis aadmi ko badi ummid ke saath vot diya tha, usee ne captain hote hue bhi sarkaar khud hi gira di
 They were happy 49 days for the poor
 bijli or pani kaa bill aadha ho gaya tha
 Policemen and electricians were nervous about demanding bribes
 lekin jis din kejariwal kii sarkaar gir gai usee din garibon ke saath phir haftaa vasuuli shuru ho gai
 On the day Kejriwal's government went in February last year, there was a lot of disappointment in the atmosphere
 aam aadmi party ke khilaaf logon main bahut gussa tha
 If elections were held in Delhi immediately after the general elections, the BJP would have reached the pinnacle of power with the help of Modi wave
 lekin us vakt bhaajapa ke ranneetikaron ne ek badi bhul kar di
 He once again underestimated Mufflerman
 unhen yakeen tha ki rajya main chunaavon main hui deree se aam aadmi party ko nuksaan hi hoga
 The cases of allegations against Ambani and Adani became troublesome for the BJP
 jabaki bhaajapa is maamle par lambey samay tak kejariwal kii awaz ko shant rakhana chaahati thi
 Modi did not want to give this freedom to anyone that when he is going to fulfill his promise of bringing his good days, then any problem will come in his way
 loksabhaa chunaav main badi haar ke baavjood apane usulon or sahi tareekon se kejariwal ne logon kii hamadardi hasil kii or pareshaani ke daur main bhi apane aap ko ek netaa ke taur par sthapit kiya
 He also apologized to the public
 arvind kejariwal ne nabbe saal kii antee se, chaatro se, sabjeewalon se or rikhshaavaalon se maafee maangi
 He apologized most often wherever he went
 unki awaz main dukh saaf jhalak rahaa tha
 He realized that he made a mistake but now he will never do it
 ek babu se saamaajik kaaryakarta bane or phir ek asli netaa ban gaye
 Indian voters forgive very easily
 unhone indira gandhi ko apatkaal lagane or modi ko gujarat dangon ke liye bhi maaf kar diya tha
 So Kejriwal's crime is very small in front of him
 bijepi ke nae commander amit shah maharashtra, haryana, or jharkhand rajyon main jeet par jeet hasil kar rahe the or jammu kashmir main apana dam dikhaa rahe the
 But Kejriwal did not make his move outside Delhi
 or jab tak bijepi ke ranbankure apni kaamyaab vijayyatra ko puraa kar dilli laute aam aadmi party ne unke liye dilli ko ek badi jang kaa maidan bana diya
 When it comes to choosing the poor or the rest of the people in their favor, the leaders talk of the poor in the day but the rest of the people at night
 khaskar chunaav main to aisa hi hota he
 60 percent of Delhi i
e
 1
 3 karod janata 13,500 rupee pratimah par jiti he
 These people who live up to expectations are the biggest supporters of Kejriwal in this fight
 do hafte se main rajdhani ke doordaraj vaale aise ilaakon main gum rahaa hum, jinke hone kaa mujhe pataa bhi nahin tha
 Delhi of the poor is completely different from the Delhi where we live
 nizamuddin main bhi logon ke liye samasyaayein hai, lekin unke saamne astitv kaa sankat nahin he
 Or their lives do not pass like the poor every day in places like a cemetery
 jaraa ballimaran kii tang galiyon main rahane waalon se puuchhie yaa phir shahar kii gandagi main jeene vaale moti nagar vaasiyon se yaa phir shahar ke bich gaanv jaise muniraka waalon se
 All of them, including family, are holding the broom firmly
 aam chunaavon ke dauraan modi ke joardaar prachaar abhiyaan ne bhavishya ke chunaavon ke liye ek udhaaharan sthapit kiya
 But not a single step of BJP in the election campaign of Delhi is not right
 ek ke baad ek galtiyaan hoti ja rahi hai
 Kiran Bedi has been brought to turn the dice in this election
 ve aisa kar bhi rahi hai
 But not the way the BJP expects
 unki ummidavaari ke baad bijepi ke sthaneey netaa sadame main hai
 They are going on campaign to show off to the central leaders
 asal main ve udhaas or niraash hai
 Everyone is waiting for this decision of the leadership to be proved wrong
 bedi ko en chunaav ke maukey par party main laayaa gaya
 In such a situation, it is not possible to establish a rapport with the party workers
 kai muddon par unke vichaar party ke vichaaron se alag hai
 Apart from this, in every state where every BJP leader is accustomed to work according to his own work, Bedi's policing is creating style and hurdle
 krishna nagar main kiran bedi ke saath road sho main main tha
 Nearly a hundred activists were dancing everywhere and walking with firecrackers
 asli aam aurat apane ghar kii khidki se baahar jhaank to rahi thi lekin usne is juluus main koi dilchaspee nahin lee
 Amit Shah very soon realized that the Delhi BJP unit is embroiled in mutual factionalism, its leaders cannot be trusted to win the elections
 so, amit shah ne dilli chunaav kii kaman apane haath main le lee
 In one week, he gave as many interviews as he had not given in a year
 inamen party ke sheersh netaaon se mulakaaton or booth str tak kii ranneeti kaa zikr tha
 He completely threw himself into it
 modi sarkaar ke mantriyon ko paanch-paanch siton kii jimmedaari di gai
 For the safety of their chairs, all the ministers are monitoring every aspect of the election campaign day and night
 aresas bhi party ko majboot karne ke liye juty he
 Sangh campaigners from Odisha, Jharkhand and other states have been called to help BJP in Delhi elections
 party kii dilli ikai ke samanaantar or usase bhi bada ek sanghathan khadaa kiya gaya he
 Fed up with the Delhi bjp's arrogance, the central leadership has put in charge workers who have no direct link to the elections
 is vajah se bhaajapa kaa abhiyaan kamjor lag rahaa he
 The parallel organization seems to be helping separately but due to this, voters are also getting confused in the constituency
 kyonki isamen bahari logon kii khaasi sankhya he, jinhen dilli ke matadaata nahin pahachaanate
 This election has also brought a fundamental difference between the present situation of the BJP and the Congress
 congress party ko apana bura vakt dikhaai de rahaa he
 And the party is ready to suffer another big defeat
 lekin bijepi main jab lag rahaa he ki chunautiyaan bad rahi hai to amit shah or unki team har sambhav prayaas kar rahi he party ko usase nikaalane kaa
 Hardly any political party has ever used so many resources in the election of a small state like Delhi
 ye chunaav bilkul ek aadmi or puri sena ke bich he
 And this will decide the direction of Indian politics
 yahaan bhaajapa kii jeet ko modi ke vijayrath se jodakar dekha jayega
 And will make the shah-modi pair unbeatable
 lekin agar bijepi haar gai to bihar vidhansabha ke mushkil chunaav se thik pehle modi virodhiyon ko mauka mil jayega
 And Arvind Kejriwal will emerge as a big leader who will be a face against Modi for all the opposition in the 2019 general election
 saare vipakshi dal unke peeche honge

 Politics has been hot about Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 congress ne bijepi par patel kii viraasat ko hadapney kaa aarope lagaaya he to bijepi ne sidhe-sidhe kaha he ki congress ke 'pet main dard' he
 Taking a dig at the Congress allegations, BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi sarcastically said that the pain in the stomach of the Congress is only because the statue that Narendra Modi is getting built will be bigger than the people of nehru-gandhi family
 nakvi ne kaha, 'aajkal achaanak congress ko sardaar patel kii bahut chintaa hone lagi he
 Suddenly the love of the Congress towards Sardar Patel is not love, but it is sad that this statue of Patel to be established will be bigger than the statues of the people of the nehru-gandhi family across the country
 'mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne kaha ki congress ne isse pehle sardaar patel kii kabhi sud nahin lee
 For the Congress, there is no great man other than Pandit Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi
 nakvi ne kaha, 'congress chintaa nahin kare
 The country has paid the debt due to the sacrifice of the nehru-gandhi family with interest
 ab desh sirf papa, mummy, daadi, nani kii baat nahin sunanaa chahta
 The country wants development, freedom from corruption and inflation
 'ye aarope lagaaya tha congress necongress ne mangalvaar ko modi or bijepi par sardaar patel kii viraasat ko hathiyaane kaa prayaas karne kaa aarope lagaaya or yaad dilaayaa ki yah patel hi the, jinhone kaha tha ki 'aresas ke sampradayik unmaad' ne mahatma gandhi kii jaan lee
 Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh targeted the BJP, saying it wanted to project Patel as its ideal, who had banned the RSS after Gandhi's assassination
 dilachasp baat yah he ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne ahmedabad main desh ke pehle grih mantri sardaar patel ko samarpit sangrahalay kaa udghaatan karne ke liye modi ke saath manch saajha kiya
 Modi claims that the statue of Sardar Patel to be installed in the Narmada River will be bigger than any statue in the world till now
 modi ne deshbhar ke gaanvon se is pratimaa ke liye lohe kaa tukdaa maanga he
 The statue is named 'statue of Unity'

 'input: bhashaa On the 9th of October, domestic and foreign tourists started gathering at the Parinirvana site of Mahatma Buddha in Kushinagar, Uttar Pradesh
 yahaan vishwa prasiddh buddha nirvana mandir or stupa hai
 In the temple, a huge statue of Buddha made of sandstone is installed in a lying posture
 mandir ke thik saamne bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan kaa daftar he, jiske baahar board par chetavanee likhi he ki ye smarak ''pracheen sansmarak tathaa puratathvik sthal evam avshesh adhinium-1958" ke tahat rashtriya mahatv ke hai
 Damaging them in any way is a punishable offense
 lekin mandir ke teen ore ganda pani bharaa he, jo maano is sandesh ko munh chidhaa rahaa he
 What could be more damaging than this, that there is water on three sides of the monument which is intent on hollowing out its roots
 nirvana mandir se kareeb 200 meter aage maathaa kunwar mandir he
 a three meter high statue of Buddha made of blue stone is installed here, in which he is in the ground touch posture under the Bodhi tree
 buddha ke anuyaayiyon kii tapasthali ke taur par mashhoor yah mandir 9 aktubar kii dopaher 12 baje chaaron ore pani main duba hua tha
 The precautionary temple was locked and devotees were disheartened from outside the complex
 yahaan se kuch dur ramaabhaar stupa he jo buddha kaa antim sanskaar sthal he
 In Buddhist traditions, the water behind this circular stupa, known as Mukutbandhan Chaitya, is permeating through the cracks and entering the stupa
 saaf he ki kushinagar ko antarrashtriya paryaton sthal ke rup main viksit karne kii sarkaar kii koshishon par pani phir rahaa he
 Attempts to woo the Dalits in the name of Buddha are also shaking as soon as the assembly elections in UP are over, but everyone is turning their backs on the plight of Buddha's symbol sites and the danger hovering over their existence
 april main aal india bhikshu sangh ke binar tale shuru hone vaali dhakvam chetana yatra ke sanyojak sheel rakshit bhikkhu buddha kii parinirvana sthali main maujuud smarakon kii badahaali par rosh vyakt karte hai
 He says, "if attention is not given in time, then the existence of these world famous monuments will end with water
 "sinchai, puraatatv vibhaag main fansaa pechbuddha kii parinirvana sthali ke rup main mashhoor kushinagar kii khudaai san 1876 main angrej puratatvavid karlile ne shuru kii thi
 The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) started preserving these monuments in 1927 after excavating the stupa, temple
 ees se sevanivruth adhikari rakesh kumaar bataate hai, ''kushinagar main utkhanan se mili avshesh dharaatal se neeche paae gaye
 ASI also preserved them in this form
 dhire-dhire aasapaas vikaas hone se ve sthaan dharaatal se upar uth gaye or smarak apekshaakrit neeche rah gaye
 Being established on low land, the rain fills the water around these monuments
 " samasya parinirvana sthal se 500 meter dur pashchim main bahane vaale kushinagar rajbaha ko lekar bhi he
 Monuments at the Parinirvana site come under threat whenever water is released into this canal operated under the supervision of the Irrigation Department
 sitambar ke antim hafte main is nahar main pani aayaa or smarak bhi dub gaye
 To overcome this problem, ASI proposed five years ago to make the track of the 60 km long Kushinagar Rajabha a km long which passes through the monuments
 ees ek darjan se zyada patr sinchai vibhaag ko likh chukaa he par nahar ke kinare ko pakkaa karne kaa koi kaam abhi tak nahin shuru hua he
 Engineer Pankaj Tiwari, Senior Conservation Officer, Department of Archeology, posted in Kushinagar, says, "with the canal track fixed, about 70 percent of the problem of water filling in monuments will be solved
 " kushinagar ke jiladhikari shambhu kumaar kehete hai ki sinchai vibhaag se is bare main jaankaree lee ja rahi he
 It will be resolved soon
 kushinagar main bhugarbha jal str ke kaaphi ooncha hone or parinirvana sthal ke chaaron ore kheton kii maujuudagi ko bhi smarakon main jal bharaav ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya ja rahaa he
 At the same pace of tourism, the work of finding the emblem sites associated with Buddha in Kushinagar is also incomplete
 aitihaasik drushti se kushinagar main buddha se jude chaar ahm sthal hai
 Among these, the Archaeological Department has excavated the cremation ground, last preaching site and posture site
 par buddha ke dhaatu vibhaajan sthal ko ab tak nahin khoja ja sakaa he
 According to the Jataka tales of Buddhism, the Buddha was cremated on the banks of the Hiranyavati River after Mahaparinirvana
 dah sanskaar ke baad unke asthi avasheshon ko jis jagah baanta gaya, use khoja nahin ja sakaa he
 However, the Buddha Parinirvana site of Kushinagar is buzzed with tourists from October to March
 ees ke aankadon ke mutabik, is dauraan yahaan roj ausatan 400 videshi or 1,000 bhartiya paryatak aate hai
 But their average stay in Kushinagar is very low
 shambhu kumaar bataate hai, ''bihar ke bodhgaya main paryatak ausatan do se teen din rukate hai, vahiin kushinagar main aadha din bhi nahin bitaate
 "because of this, the business related to tourism in Kushinagar is not flourishing at the same pace as in other symbol sites associated with Buddha
 yahaan paryaton ko badhaava dene ke liye vishwa bank aage aayaa he
 Under his supervision, the pro-tourism development project is going to start here
 29 sitambar ko ''buddhist circuit project" ke salaahkaar navajit khatri ke netritv main vishwa bank kii chaar sadasyeey team ne kushinagar kaa daura kar iskaa khaakaa khinchaa
 Shambhu Kumar says, "by what way did Mahatma Buddha reach Kushinagar? How to cross the river? Small industries related to tourism will be promoted by developing them into a scenic spot

 in teen saal main jila prashasan ne kisaanon se kareeb sava sau acre jameen kaa adhigrahan to kar liya par iske aage koi bhi kaam shuru nahin hua
 In 2001, when the Taliban militants destroyed a huge Buddha statue in Bamiyan, Afghanistan, the Maitreya Trust announced a 500-foot-high statue of Buddha in Kushinagar
 project ko saakaar karne ke liye samskruti vibhaag or maitrey pariyojna trust ke bich may 2003 main qaraar hua tha
 In the initial phase, the government had to provide 660 acres of land for the project
 bhoomi adhigrahan main aae avrodh ne pariyojna ke aakaar ko chota kar diya
 The height of the bronze statue of Buddha was reduced from 500 feet to 200 feet, and the government now needed only 250 acres
 baavjood iske kisaanon ke virodh ne 13 varsh ke baad bhi pariyojna ke haath baandh rakhe hai
 Mithilesh Singh, the farmer who appealed against the land acquisition in the court, says, "the administration has not yet made any boundaries for the land it has acquired
 aise main ve kisaan jinaki jameen project ke kinare par he, simakan nahin hone se apni jameen par kheti nahin kar paa rahe hai
 "the officials associated with Maitreya Trust are also talking about starting work on the project only after the land dispute is completely resolved
 trust se jude ek adhikari bataate hai, ''project report ke anusaar kaam shuru hone ke paanch varsh ke bheetar yojana puri tarah se aakaar le legi
 a decision will be taken soon to start the work

 Five years ago, the couple thought that whatever they would get from farming, apart from running the household, they would save something to make the elder daughter's hands yellow
 par lagaataar tisare saal prakruti kii berukhi ne unke sapanom par pani pher diyasukhad ke pehle se sanjokar rakhi gai raashi bhi khetibari or ghar-gruhasthi main kharch ho chuki he
 The matter does not end here, due to the drought, such a serious problem of livelihood has arisen in front of this family that Surendra Singh, resident of Bindichak village of Kauakol block of Nawada district, is looking for employment for the first time with his three daughters and two sons with his wife
 i left for Surat last week
 vaise to unke paas teen bigha jameen he
 He had made up his mind to have an alternative arrangement in the village itself by taking a loan from the bank under the Kisan Credit Card
 lekin bank kii trutipurna karypranali ke kaaran unhen yah mauka nahin mila
 Therefore, going abroad to raise the family became his compulsion
 unki patni aashaa devi kahatee hai, ''lagaataar sukhaad se jamaa-puunji khatm ho gai thi, ab bacchon ke bhukhon marane kii naubat aa gai he
 But till date none of the benefits of government schemes were given
 isliye unke pati ke paas pardes jane ke sivaa doosraa koi chaara nahin bachaa
 The situation of other farmers in the village is no less pathetic
 krishna murari singh bhi teen bigha ke maalik hai
 To compensate for the drought of previous years, this year they were hoping for good farming
 lekin anaavrishti se ghar kii jamaa-puunji bhi kharch ho gai
 Now, the eight-member family, including wife and children, has also got the bread of June 2

 In spite of no rain, he planted paddy in a bigha with the help of a diesel pumpset
 lekin rope gaye dhan ko bachaana mushkil ho rahaa he
 He says, "A bigha will hardly have 30-35 mana paddy, with a market value of a maximum of Rs 7,000
 hoga lekin ropani ke samay tak hi 3,000 ru
 Expenses have been incurred, which will consistently result in a higher cost price than diesel produced in Patwon

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne shuukravaar ko apane 4 ke shasankaal main pehali baar avishvaas prastaav kaa saamana kiya
 Speaking after a day-long debate, Modi selectively responded to the opposition's attack
 kareeb 90 minute ke bhaashan kii shuruyaat modi ne vipaksh ddhara laae gaye avishvaas prastaav ke saath kiya
 He described it as an important force of democracy

 Nevertheless it was brought

 We read in the newspaper that immediately after the statement was given that who says we do not have numbers

 The Meteorological Department will release such figures - if the rainfall is less than 10 percent in the entire season, it will be considered as normal rain
 - barish 10 fisadi se zyada kam rahane par isko saamaanya se kam barish kaha jayega
 - If the rainfall is more than 10 percent, it will be raining more than normal
 - barish 10 fisadi se zyada kam rahane ke saath hi puure desh ke 20 se 40 fisadi hisse main aisa hone par ise kam varsha vaala saal kaha jayega
 - With rainfall being less than 10 percent, it will be called a year of very less rainfall when it happens in more than 40 percent of the country
 sookhaa bolne se parhez karegaa vibhagadesh main barish bhale na ho lekin mausam vibhaag sookhaa bolne se parhez karegaa
