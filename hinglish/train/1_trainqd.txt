 Opposition parties have been questioning the Modi government's decision on long lines and deaths due to lack of money and distressed people outside the banks, but the party has come forward to keep Modi out of the box of allegations
 notebandi ke phaayde bataane or ginane kaa kaam ab bijepi ne yudhstar par shuru kar diya he or wo aise kii sabhi netaaon ko kah diya gaya he ki jaise bhi ho, jis par tareeke se ho, notebandi ke phaaydon ko janata ko bataaya jaae
 Posters are also the best way for politicians, so posters have started in support of demonetisation
 dilli bijepi ne bade-bade hording dilli ke alag alag sthanon par lagavaaye hai
 These posters with photographs of Delhi BJP President Satish Upadhyay with Modi have been written in a sequential manner
 aatankwaad kii tuutegi kamarhar ek phaayde ko bade loklubhaavan andaaj main ginaya gaya he
 The first advantage in this is the militant and extremist action of the Naxalites
 poster main daawa kiya gaya he ki notebandi se aatankwaad kaa khaatmaa karne main madad milegi, kyonki blike mani ke jariye hi desh main aatankwaad fal phool rahaa he
 Houses will be cheap The second biggest benefit has been counted as the abolition of black money, because the money earned by corruption in this demonetization has become useless
 tisare phaayde ke taur par daawa kiya gaya he ki notebandi se real estate sector main bhav kam honge or makaan khareednaa ab aam aadmi kii jad main aa jayega
 The business of counterfeit notes will stop for the fourth time
 The benefit of fake currency, which is present in the country in a big way, will be eradicated, because fake notes of five hundred and thousand rupees were printed from Pakistan and were reducing the economy of the country, but by demonetization Now the fake currency will come to an end
 sutron ke mutabik party kii taraf se netaaon ko kaha gaya he ki wo apane apane ilaakon main notebandi ke phaaydon kaa prachaar karen, to turant iskaa asar bhi dikh gaya he
 Because the local leaders of the party broke the walls with posters and from hoardings along the roads
 dilli bijepi ke pravaktaa praveen shankar kapur ke mutabik vipaksh notebandi ko lekar dushprachaar kar rahaa he
 All the rumors are being spread, in such a way, if people are told the right benefits, then what is the harm in this? ab bhale hi wo prachaar ke kisi bhi madhyam se ho vaise to is tarah ke poster koi nai baat nahin he, har maukey par raajnneetik sandesh dene ke liye poster or hording kaa istemaal hota hi he

 The BJP has lost both the seats of the state and the SP has won, but the Congress could not even save its bail
 iske baavjood congress is baat se khush he ki bijepi ko haar mili he
 But the solidarity of the satraps can cause trouble for the Congress more than the BJP

 In Uttar Pradesh, the BSP was in the sp's efforts but not the Congress

 Not only this, the Congress has also reduced its 60 percent vote in both seats

 The SP-BSP experiment in the by-election to challenge the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections was successful
 ise vipakshi golbandi kaa pehla prayog mana ja rahaa he
 In the by-election, the way the strong fort of BJP has won the SP in Gorakhpur
 isse akhilesh yadav ke hausale buland ho gaye hai
 On the other hand, Tejashwi Yadav, who holds the political legacy of Lalu with the victory of RJD in one Araria Lok Sabha and Jehanabad assembly by-elections in Bihar, is also proud

 Rahul tweeted on Wednesday that it is clear from the results that there is a lot of anger among the voters for the BJP and they will vote for the non-bjp candidate who is most likely to win
 congress upi main navnirmaan ke liye tatpar he, ye rato-raat nahin hoga
 The bjp's defeat in the by-election has given the opposition a winning formula
 2019 ke chunaav main bijepi ko maat dene ke liye vipakshi dal ekajute ho sakate hai
 anti-modi is trying to unite
 congress bhi isi kavayad main juty he
 a day before the by-election results, UPA chairman and former Congress president Sonia Gandhi called the opposition parties for dinner
 mahagathbandhan banane par modi ke mukaable cheharaa koun hoga, ye vipaksh ke bich bada sawaal he, jiskaa uttar talash kar paanaa aasaan nahin he
 The Congress does not seem to be in the mood to accept the leader of any regional party as the face of the Prime Minister
 vahiin vipaksh ke kshatrap jo congress ke sambhavit sahyogi dal hai, wo philhal rahul gandhi or congress ke anya kisi netaa ko piem ummidavaar ke taur par sweekaar karne ko raji nahin hai
 Actually the satrap has its own political power
 upi main 80 loksabhaa, pashchim bengal main 42, bihar main 40 or tamilnadu main 39 siten hai
 In all, there are around 201 Lok Sabha seats and Congress is the junior partner (SP, BSP, TMC, Left, RJD and DMK) in these four states
 aise main congress ko kshetreey dalon kii marji par nirbhar rahanaa padegaa
 The demand of the Congress is not going to be fulfilled but these states will have to depend on the mercy of the regional parties
 congress adhyaksh ke taur par jis din rahul gandhi kii tajposhi ho rahi thi, us samay argedy netaa tejasvi yadav unhen 2019 main piem bataa rahe the, lekin teen maheene ke baad jab sonia ke dinar party se baahar nikle to rahul ko 2019 kaa piem ummidavaar bataane se gurej karte dikhe
 This means that in 2019, Rahul may be the face of the Congress but will be the opposition, it is difficult to say

 The video that is being talked about does not contain hatred, only humor

 unhone kaha ki hamaari videsh niti 70 saal puraani he
 Do not keep one at the cost of the other
 hamen israeli pradhanmantri netanyahu ko vahi sammaan dena chahie jo ham duusare mehmaan ko dete hai
 On the dispute of the Supreme Court judges, Singhvi said that it is a matter between the judicial family
 us par yahaan se tippanee nahin karenge
 Ban the entry of Congressmen in Yogi ji temples
 On the question of Rahul Gandhi circling the temples for some time, Singhvi said that the BJP should stand guard at the temples
 mandir bijepi ke liye arakshit hai
 He said that i did not see cheap politics
 singhvi ne kaha ki main yogi ji ke saamne prastaav rakhata hum
 They put guards outside the temples and ban Congressmen from leaving
 ve niyam bana den ki sirf bijepi vaale hi mandir jaaenge
 The limit is that those who used to go to the temple themselves, are now talking about the politics of development
 HUGPLOMACY se piem kaa udaaya tha majaakcongress ne kal piem modi kaa majaak banaate hue ek video twit kiya tha
 In this tweet, it was written that Israeli PM Netanyahu has reached India and we hope to see Modi's hugs
 congress ke is video main modi kii duniya bhar ke netaaon se huin puraani mulakaaton ke video hai
 It shows Modi hugging and shaking hands with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Japanese PM Shinzo Abe and his wife Eki Abe and US President Donald Trump

 The Congress has tweeted this video targeting this
 congress ke aadhikarik twitor handle se kiye gaye is twit main kaha gaya he ki ab modi kii 'hagplomaisi' kaa zyada intjaar nahin ho rahaa he
 BJP had reacted strongly to this video of Congress: BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said that such a tweet was not expected from India's main opposition party
 vah bhi aise samay par jab sammanit videshi piem bharat pahunche hi hai
 The president of the Congress only talks about winning hearts with love, while in reality the Indian PM is doing it
 vah duniya ko pyaar se jeet rahe hai

 Palash flowers are brought in the forest by plucking from the trees, for the traditional Holi, the villagers climb the trees in the forest and pluck the flowers of red colored palash
 is paaramparik holi main istemaal kiye jane vaale rang inhen palash ke phulon se taiyaar kiye jate hai
 This is the traditional Holi of the village of Jharkhand
 holi ke liye rang banane kii ye taiyaari teen-chaar din pehle se shuru ho jaati he
 Flowers brought from the forest are first soaked in water to prepare the color and then rubbed on the stones
 puri tarah ghis jane ke baad inhen kapadon main daalkar chaan liya jaataa he or iske baad taiyaar ho jaataa he bilkul shuddh herbal rang
 These colors have no side effects and they also disappear quickly
 garmiyaan aane ke saath hi khil jate hai ye phulholike maukey par jharkhand ke jangalon main prakruti apni chatha bikherti he
 With the coming of summer, the forests cover the red sheet, in fact these colors are due to the red colored flowers of Palash

 This is Bangladesh's second consecutive defeat in the five-nation regional tournament
 mominul haq (50), nasir hossain (41) or jiyaur rahamaan (41) ke alaava koi bhi ballebaaj krij par date rahane kaa dhary nahin barat sakaa
 In the end, Rahman tried to change the course of the game by collecting some great shots but his effort could not stop Afghanistan from creating cricket history
 afghanistan kii antarrashtriya str par anubhavheenata kaa andaja is baat se hi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki unke kshetrarakshakon ne kam se chaar kaich chode or kuch aasaan ran bhi de die
 But despite all this, Afghanistan won a dramatic victory over Bangladesh, the team players and support staff started swinging happily
 afghanistan ke liye mohammad nabi ne 44 ran dekar teen jabaki shapur zardaan or hamid hasan ne do do wicket praapt kiye
 Bangladesh had a poor start, losing the wickets of openers Shamsur Rahman (00) and Enamul Haque (01) on the score of one run

 stanicjai shuru main thode dhime the, unhone apana chauthaa vanade ardhashatak jamaane main 81 gend kaa saamana kiya
 But after reaching the half-century, the 26-year-old started beating the bowlers of the host team around the park
 stanicjai ne 103 gend main chah chauke or teen chakke se naabad 90 ran banaae
 At the same time, Shenwari scored 81 runs in just 69 balls with 10 fours and a six

 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday presented the budget for the financial year 2019-20 in the Lok Sabha
 basapa adhyaksh mayawati (mayawati) ne kendriya bajet (budget) par pratikriya dete hue kaha ki yah bajet bade puunjipatiyon ko raahat pahunchane vaala he
 Mayawati tweeted, "this budget is going to help the big capitalists and Dhannaseth in every way by promoting the private sector
" isse daliton va pichhadon ke aarakshan ko hi nuksaan nahin hoga, balki mahangaai, garibi, berogari, kisaan va gramin samasya or bhi jatil hogi

 Let me put this concept in the right conceptual context first
 darasal 'hindu' ke liye 'hindutv' kaa arth vahi he jo 'isai' ke liye 'isiyat' hota he
 It is a matter of basic grammar that it is an expressive noun, formed by adding the etymology, or yat, to an adjective or noun
 is rup main yah 'uske marm yaa siddhant' ko bataati he
 If this means, then what is the problem? The problem is that political power has been gained by rejecting Hinduism and dividing Hindu society into 'good' and 'bad'
 us hindu ko acha kaha jaataa he, jo vah ghanghor bure bartaav ke baavjood vinamr or dabbu bana rahata he, keval isliye ki uski sadabahaar khubi uski 'sahishnutaa' he
 But when he insists on his values or fights for it, he becomes 'bad' i
e
 one who is 'hindutva' or 'intolerant of others'
 bade ahankaar ke saath kaha jaataa he ki hindu ko to ham sweekaar karte hai, par hindutv ko khaarij karte hai, matlab yah ki 'hindu hone' kii koshish ko asweekaar kar diya jaataa he
 The whole meaning of this tricky argument is that "if you let us insult and contempt you accept us
" alabatta agar tum apni buniyadi baton (mulyon, vishwaason, pratikon, nayakon) par hamaare hamale kaa palatakar jawaab dete ho to ham tumhen 'kattarpanthi', 'fasivadi' or isliye patit yaa pratigaami kahenge
 "the word" Hindutva "is ruthlessly sought to be cut from the word shastra or its roots and its equivalents from other religions, which are interpreted as antonyms of Hinduism
 saath hi ise hindu sabhyataa kii 'vichaardhaara' ke taur par prachaarit kiya jaataa he, na ki hindu 'sabhyataa ke saar' ke taur par, balki uski vikrut nirmiti yaa rachana ke taur par
 But the truth is that Hindutva simply means 'being Hindu'
 aise bhi hindu hai jo is dharm main paidaa hone ke ittefaq kii vajah se apane ko hindu maanate hai, kyonki unke liye is baat se zyada fark nahin padataa ki ve hindu hai yaa gaiyr-hindu
 They claim the privilege of degrading Hinduism, even though they are ultimately 'hindu': but in reality they are born only in Hindu families
 aise fashanparast secularavaadiyon ne apane 'hindu-pen' ko kareeb-kareeb taj hi diya he
 Both his adversaries and advocates have already been saying a lot about Hindupan and are saying it continuously
 hindupan kii avadharana ke irdagird judi gadbaditon ne is kaam kii pechidagiyon main or ijapha kar diya he jo mukhya taur par hindustan main hasil takreeban gaiyr-jimmedaari kii had tak jane vaali bauddhik aazaadee kii badaulat hai
 Unbiased research could not be conducted in the 1980s and subsequent decades about the renewed rise of Hindu consciousness and this was due to the much-debated Hindu-inspired political discourse and the mindset arising out of that old-fashioned mindset , In which it was considered a curse to talk openly about any Hindu thing
 academik samudaay kii is niskriyata or iske saath hi siyaasi taur par sahi hone ke pehle se maujuud pralobhan ne kai tareekon se rajnatik-vichaardhaaratmak chuaachhut ko badhaane main yogadan diya
 Due to this, the work of anti-hindutva to present Hindutva as an illegitimate ideology became easier
 hindustan 1947 ke baad baqayada ijad kiye gaye vibhaajankaree saamaajik-rajnatik andolanon kaa gavaah rahaa he
 It was only the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, which united Hindu society on an issue which was an issue for them to save their existence
 yah hindu ekta kaa sandesh itane baari asardaar dhang se dene main kaamyaab rahaa ki saikadon vampanthi adhyetaon ke liye yah samajhaana mushkil ho gaya ki hindu us ek andolan ke bal par aakhir kaise ek saath aa sakate hai or aa gaye hai, jise ve phirakaaprast or savarna jatiyon ke andolan ke taur par dekhte the
 Due to the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, Hindus forgot their small caste identities for at least some time and were forced to think of a larger cultural identity - Hindu
 ram janmabhumi andolan kii kamyaabi ke baavjood, hindupan ko keval ziddee gafalat ke taur par hi samajhaayaa gaya
 The presence of many gods and goddesses for worship and diversity in practically every sphere of life, including modalities of worship, did not encompass them in the Hindu religion system and consequently in the Hindu world view
 Has been nor is it possible barbandi kaa yah sampurna inkaar hi he jisamen aadhyatmik loktantr—jo apni gaiyr-bhautik, naitik gunjon ke liye angreji kii 'spitual demokrasi' se zyada tarjihayakrata bhartiya muhaavara he
 Spiritual democracy is the single most special and most distinct feature of Hindu faith and beliefs
 kai duusare dharmon or manyataon ke ulat hindu dharm kabhi khud ko mukti yaa moksh ke ekmaatr tareeke ke taur par pesh nahin karata
 In contrast, Hinduism believes that all paths lead to the same truth, the same Almighty
 yahi siddhant or vishwaas vyapak taur par dohraye jane vaale is kathan main haih ''ekamd sat, wipro bahudhaa vadantyir' or yahi hindu aadhyatmik vichaar kii buniyaad he
 Today, when the whole world is in danger of a panic threat, and when the basic root of terror is essentially linked to the ideology driven by the superiority of the religious system, it can only be surprised that without accepting spiritual democracy How will humanity last? It is a fact that caste-based distortions have hollowed out the roots of Hindu attitudes, but the ideal would be that there is absolutely no scope for any discrimination on the basis of caste in the belief of Hindupan
 aaryon ke hamale, deshaj or gaiyr-deshaj logon ke bich takaraav, mul bashindon yaa adivaasiyon or dusron ke bich matbhedon, kuch nishchit saamaajik dhadon yaa samudaayon ko janmajaat aapraadhik qaraar dena yaa vijeta or parajiton ke bich takaraav sareekhe siddhanton or aisi hi anya baton kii hindupan kii avadharana main koi jagah nahin ho sakati
 Remember that the doctrine of invasion of Aryans was not by anyone else but Dr
 bhimrao ambedkar sareekhee shakhsiyat ne hi khaarij kar diya tha
 Social and economic justice is absolutely necessary for the perpetual unity of Hindu society
 yah kahana atishyokti nahin hoga ki samaaj ke visheshadhikaar sampann or apekshaakrit kam badakismat tabakon ko hi yah tay karnaa hoga ki saamaajik-aarthik taur par kamjor tabakon ko barabari kii hifaazat, izzat or maukey bhi hasil hon
 Hindus are known to mold themselves in every situation

 Always new, everlasting is the foundation of our thinking
 phir hindu aadhuniktaa-virdohi bhala kaise ho sakate hai? buddha ne isa purv chhathi shatabdi main hindu maanas ko roodhi se tark kii taraf mode diya tha, jo navajagaran aadhuniktaa kaa ooncha nikash tha
 Hindus will also face the challenge of accepting the fact that Hinduism is technically similar to other belief systems or beliefs
 magar vyaavhaarik taur par yah manyataon bhar se kahin zyada he, kyonki yah keval ek paigambar, keval ek pavitra pustak, yaa keval ek ishwar ko maanane kii fitrat nahin rakhata he, jaisaa zyaadaatar sami yaa semetic dharmon main mana jaataa he
 This creates a huge scope of confusion, which is also mostly caused by ruthlessness
 tamaam samoohon kii alpsankhyak kaa tamgaa hasil karne kii andhadhundh hode main shaamil hona ek sankramak beemaari ke lakshan hai
 The politics of a vote bank that promotes small identities has made the challenge before the forces uniting Hindus even more difficult
 ise teevr khandit chunaav pranali ne aasaan banaaya he
 But a true Hindu should not be afraid of all this, because if he hates spiritual democracy, then who will protect him again? —dr

 Asked what has happened to the RJD in connection with the electoral agreement, Yadav said that no talk has been made with the RJD but they consider the RJD voters as members of his family, considering Lalu Prasad as his elder brother 
 
 Though ideologies may vary

 menka gandhi ne kaha, '10 saal se congress rahul gandhi ko project kar rahi he lekin kuch nahin hua

 In order to avoid the anti-incumbency trend, the mla's power has been in power in Gujarat for the last two decades

 If sources are to be believed, BJP national president Amit Shah attended the meeting of the state parliamentary board and finalized the list of candidates
 iske alaava teen darjan aise vidhayak hai, jinke naam katane par sahmati bani he
 The BJP has now planned to place bets on the strong leaders of the same fraternity due to the weak performance of the mlas, especially in the Patidar dominated seats

 In the Lok Sabha elections 2014, this formula was tried in Gujarat
 dilli ke nagar nigam chunaavamein isi formule ke jariye fatah kiya tha
 In the Delhi Municipal Corporation elections, the BJP had converted the mcd's impossible victory into a possible one by cutting the ticket of all the councilors and replacing them with a new face
 gujarat main bijepi ne pichley vidhansabha chunaav main 182 siton main se 115 seat par jeet darj kii thi

 In this way the BJP camp has become very big

 But under the No Repeat Theory, it cannot be said that the mlas from all these other parties get tickets

 The security forces retaliated and killed both the terrorists

 After the encounter, security forces have also intensified search operations against terrorists at other places

 After or before the election
 chunaav ke baad hoga to bijepi ke saamne nitish ke kad ke hisaab se chunane kii koi samasya nahin rahegi
 Ram Vilas Paswan has said in an interview to Economic Times that once he sits in that post, people will know and he will become a leader
 unke is bayaan ko padhakar laga ki raajnneetik dalon ke liye netaa bananaa kitna aasaan khel he
 The public keeps searching for the leader in vain
 agar paswan ke hisaab se kisi ko us pad par bitha hi dena he to uskaa naam chunaav ke pehle hi bataa dena chahie
 BJP will not reveal the name of the leader before the election even after the fact that this election is an election for him to die
 bijepi ke swaabhaavik sahyogi main dhal chuke ramvilas paswan ne bhi kaha ki bihar chunaav jivan-maran kaa sawaal he
 It is no less bizarre that the BJP will not wager to name a leader in such a large election
 bijepi ke paas netaa kii kami nahin he, lekin sawaal yah he ki chunaav se pehle netaa kaa naam bataane kaa saahas he yaa nahin
 Nitish Kumar's name will not be revealed only because of the leader
 aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki ek kaa bataaya to duusare sambhavit netaaon kii jatiyon ko thes pahunch jaae
 Bihar is being elected this time not for the leader and development, but for caste prospects

 There will be some castes, which will be left behind the winning and winning caste like a wagon
 bijepi chunaav ke pehle netaa kaa naam nahin bataaegi is baat ke baad bhi ki yah chunaav uske liye jeene marane kaa chunaav he
 Ram Vilas Paswan, who has turned into a natural ally of BJP, also said that Bihar election is a question of life and death
it is no less bizarre that itane bade chunaav main bijepi kisi netaa kaa naam bataane kaa daanv nahin chalegi yah bhi kam vicitra nahin he
 The BJP does not have a leader shortage, but the question is whether it has the courage to name the leader before the election

 It is also possible that if one is told, the castes of other potential leaders get hurt
 bihar kaa chunaav is baar netaa or vikaas ke liye nahin, jatigat sambhaavnaaon ke liye ho rahaa he
 One caste will lose, one caste will win
 kuch jatiyon hongi jo haarane or jeetne vaali jati ke peeche malgadee ke dibbe kii tarah lagi rah jaaengi

 Cricketer-turned-politician Imran told Geo Super Channel after the West Indies defeat in Dhaka at the hands of Pakistan that he felt the Indian team would beat Australia in the second quarter-final
 imran ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki bharat, australia ko haraa degaa kyonki vishwa ke is hisse kii paristhatiyaan unki team (bharat) ke anukool hai or unki ballebaaji bhi kaaphi majboot he
 Former captain Imran, who won the 1992 World Cup title to Pakistan, said that he would like to see the match between India and Pakistan in the semi-finals as it would go in favor of the Pakistani team
 unhone kaha, mujhe lagata he ki gharelu darshakon ke dabaav or apni sarajameen par pakistan se haarane ke dar kii vajah se bharat par bahut dabaav rahane vaala he jabaki pakistan toornament kaa anderdag bana rahegaa

 purv sena pramukh general ve ke singh ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki ek chalati bas main chaatra se gangrape kii ghatana ‘prashasan ke puri tarah dhwast’ hone kaa parichaayak he
 Along with this, he accused the police that the police force is 'nothing more than a security agency' of vips in the capital
 singh ne kaha ki vyavastha ‘puri tarah benakaab’ ho chuki he kyonki na keval us bas main savaar ek beti is vyavastha ke bharose par thi balki sainkadon anya betiyon par bhi hamalaavaron kii ore se is prakaar kaa khatra mandara rahaa he kyonki vyavastha koi bhi karrwai nahin kar paa rahi he or yah ‘napunsakata bad rahi he
 He said, "the heinous gang-rape and brutal assault of a 23-year-old student in a bus roaming the city fearlessly indicates that the administration has completely collapsed
 yah ghatana to puri vyavastha ko jhakzorne vaali honi chahie
 'singh said,' i pray for this brave girl to be alive and my condolences are with her family
 ham ise jesica laal maamle kii tarah nahin chhod sakate
 In that case, if his family does not try, then his killers would again openly roam
 vyavastha ko sabase badi chetavanee mil chuki he
 We must wake up, before it is too late
 ’unhone is baat par jor dekar kaha ki suraksha muhaiyaa karana har sarkaar kii halphia duty he, khaastaur se police or nyaaypalika kii
 He said but instead 'we are in a situation where almost every institution of administration is eroding almost everyday
 ’singh ne kaha, ‘aaj, har vah agency jise rajya main police tathaa kanoon vyavastha banaae rakhane kii jimmedaari saunpi gayi he, vah dilli ke tathakthith ‘viviipi varg’ tathaa dhani or prasiddh logon ko suraksha muhaiyaa karaane vaali agency se adhik kuch nahin rah gayi he
 It is impossible for an average citizen to register a case even in the most severe case
 aise main kisi prakaar kaa nyaay milane kii baat to chhod hi dijie
 He said, 'let the police and security agencies do their work, moral standards of behavior should be established by the ruling class
 sankeern raajnneetik baadhyataaon ke chalate liya gaya har nitigat faisla hamaari vyavastha ko dhwast karata he or iske andruni tathaa bahari suraksha par galat prabhaav padate hai

 From the condition of the economy to the condition of the farmers, mob lynching, the politics of Kashmir, special state status, there are many important issues, which will be heard in the session starting from July 18
 lekin sarkaar ke saamne chunauti sirf vipaksh nahin balki sahyogi bhi hai
 TDP had broken in the last budget
 TDP, which was adamant about its demands, left the government during the mid-session
 endie kaa hissaa rahi tidipi andhra pradesh ke liye vishesh rajya kaa darja maang rahi thi
 Also, special financial assistance for the state was its priority
 is baar tidipi to vipaksh main khadi he lekin shivasena or jediu jaise sahyogi dal sarkaar ke saamne chunauti pesh kar sakate hai
 The government cannot even ignore the demands of the ally and a direct attack on them like the opposition will not be easy
 sarkaar par hamalavar shivasenashivsena kaa ravaiya kisi se bhi chupa nahin he or vah kai maukon par modisarkaar ke khilaaf morchabandikrti ai he
 Whether it is the issue of inflation or the worsening situation of Kashmir, on every occasion Shiv Sena has taken a tough stand against the Modi government despite being an ally
 aagaamee satr main bhi sarkaar ko shivasena se sahyogi kii ummid kam he
 Alam is that amidst the efforts of Man Munwwal, BJP President Amit Shah also met Uddhav Thackeray but that too proved fruitless
 pichley bajet satr ke dauraan bhi bagawati tevar dikhaate hue shivasena ne saansadon kii ore se vetan na lene ke NDA ke faisle se pallaa jhaad liya tha
 Nitish needs a special state, the second ally jdu's stance is not as articulate as that of the Shiv Sena, but is definitely strong politically
 bihar main satta ke nae sahyogi jediu ke apane rajya ke liye vishesh rajya kaa darja chahie
 It has also sought more seats from the BJP in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 isi mudde par amit shah or jediu chif nitish kumaar dilli main mulaakaat kar chuke hai
 The mathematics of the seats is not decided yet and the status of the special state is also on the back burner
 nitish kumaar kii party kai manch par centre se bihar ke lievishesh rajya kaa darjamang chuki he
 In the meeting of NITI Aayog recently, Nitish in front of PM Narendra Modi reiterated his demand and supported the granting of special state status to Andhra Pradesh
 lekin agar jediu yahi maang sansad ke bheetar uthaate hi to sarkaar liye mushkilen khadi kar sakati he
 The NDA would not like to offend any of its partners in view of the election in the Rajya Sabha
 ucch sadan main vaise hi bijepi ke paas sankhyabal kam he aise main agar sahyogi dur hote hai to yah sarkaar ke liye yah mushkil vakt hoga
 Before the 2019 elections, the NDA wants to keep its camp strong under all circumstances, as well as several important bills are pending in the Monsoon Session of Parliament which can be difficult to pass without allies

 BJP office scene in Dehradun: Holi and Diwali were being celebrated together here on Saturday
 ek ore pataakhon kii ladiyaan jal rahi thim or duusari ore gulaal ke saath holi ke rang har ore bikhar rahe the
 Among the slogans that were echoed, the most heard was - Har har Modi
 
 
 ghar ghar modi’ or in naaron ke saath hawa main laharaa rahaa tha modi kaa ek bada cat out
 Amidst this same joyous joy, a voice came in my ears reporting
 is rangeen maahaul ko dekhakar bijepi ke ek samarthak ne apane saathi se kaha, “ye to bilkul shiv kaa avatar he bhai
 
 shivaji kaa avatar
 This statement about Modi is also the story behind the mandate given to the BJP in the states of Uttarakhand to Uttar Pradesh and Hindi belt where the party has been spreading in the last three years
 modi pichley teen saalon main aam voter ke bich lokapriyata kii aasamaani seedhiyaan chadhi hai
 But for the total people, they have become divine incarnations
 unhone apni raajnneeti main jin chizon ko shaamil kiya he vah saamaajik or aarthik barabari kaa falaspha bhi he or rashtrawaad ke saath bhrashtachar ke khilaaf muhim kii apil bhi
 When Modi makes speeches and cremation statements in the speeches, a large part of the society gets a sense of being special and protected from the neglected
 modi sargical strike ke baad jis tarah se use desh kii asmita or sainikon ke sammaan ke saath pesh karte hai usase ek aam voter ko ehsaas hota he ki desh kii simaaon ko pehali baar surakshit karne kii pahal kii gai he
 Former generals told TV that the surgical strike was not the first time, but the manner in which the Prime Minister presented the army's actions in his statements and speeches gave a sense of 'self-respect' to the 'desperate' people for the first time
 narendra modi kai maamalon main apane virodhiyon ko peeche chhodte hai or lagata he ki unhen kai morchon par modi se kaaphi kuch siikhnaa he
 Akhilesh Yadav's statement that the votes are met by persuading the voter not to point to it
 yani modi apane votaron ko wo bharosa dilaa rahe hai jo ab tak unhen nahin mil paaya
 For example, farmers were also troubled by demonetisation, small businessmen as well as poor people
 kaam dhandhe chaupat huye or kai logon ko naukariyon se haath dhaana padaa
 Former finance minister and Congress leader p Chidambaram has said that the victory in UP and Uttarakhand cannot be called a referendum on demonetisation as you will have to consider the opposite in the other three states Punjab, Goa and Manipur
 phir bhi notebandi se hui tamaam dikkaton ke baad bhi log bijepi ko vot dete hai to ye maananaa hoga ki modi logon ke ye samajhane main safal huye ki unka ye kadam bhrashtachar, aatankwaad or kaale dhan ke khilaaf tha
 Every journalist reporting on the ground heard this from the mouth of the people - 'yes there is a problem but this step is in the interest of the country
 ’ yahaan mahatvapurn ye he ki ye kadam desh ke hi hit main nahin logon ko nijee hit main bhi laga he
 Modi told the people - 'they looted, i will return' and people realized that now they have become equal to the rich who deposited black money
 ye baat bhi dhyaan dene kii he ki bijepi ne kisi musalmaan ko upi main tikat nahin diya jaisaa ki usne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main kiya tha
 The bjp's move may be for Hindu polarization, but Modi and Amit Shah's pair have presented it as a model of progressive politics
 upi ke chunaav main un siton par bijepi ne baari jeet hasil kii he jin siton par muslim bahul aabaadi thi
 The BJP has once again succeeded in areas with Jat population, and has also won a seat like Deoband
 tippaniyan Modi's ministers take his neuter forward
 isiliye vittamantri arun jetali huddang karne vaale abivipi ke chaatro par kisi tarah kaa kathor bayaan dene ke bajaay kehete hai ki bharat akelaa desh he jahaan rashtrawaad kii baat karnaa galat lagata he to amit shah congress, bispi or samaajawaadee party ke liye kasaab shabd kaa istemaal karne ke baad bhi kah pate hai ki log dharm or jati kii raajnneeti se ub gayi hai or wo vikaas chaahate hai
 That is, Narendra Modi has transformed the issue of Hindutva from his propaganda style into a war against pseudo-secularism and appeasement politics and now the credibility of all 'secular' parties will be the main strategy of BJP
 yahi nahin unhone notebandi jaise apane aarthik kadam ko jis tarah se sargical strike or rashtrawaad ke saath joda he vah ek aisa mishran he jo unhen desh ke tamaam hisson ke votaron ke bich lokapriy bana rahaa he
 Before dealing with this power, his opponents have to remember that Modi has acquired the image of Shiva's avatar
 khushi ke isi huddang ke bich reporting karte hue ek awaz mere kaanon main padi
 Seeing this colorful atmosphere, a supporter of the BJP told his partner, "this is exactly Shiva's avatar brother
 
 The incarnation of Shiva
 ” modi ke bare main ye bayaan uttarakhand se lekar uttar pradesh or hindi pattee ke un rajyon main bijepi ko mili janadesh ke peeche kii kahani bhi he jahaan pichley teen saalon main party failati gai he
 In the last three years, Modi has climbed the ladder of popularity among common voters
 lekin kul logon ke liye wo divine avatar ban gayi hai
 The things he has included in his politics are also the result of social and economic equality and the appeal of the campaign against corruption along with nationalism
 modi jab bhaashanon main kabristaan or shmashaan vaale bayaan dete hai to samaaj ko ek bade hisse ko upekshit se vishesh or sangrakshit hone kaa ehsaas miltaa he
 The manner in which Modi presents him with the country's dignity and respect for the soldiers after the surgical strike makes a common voter realize that the initiative has been taken to secure the country's borders for the first time
 purv generalon ne tivi kaha ki sargical strike pehali baar nahin kii gai lekin pradhanmantri ne sena kii karrwai ko jis andaaz main apane bayanon or bhaashanon main pesh kiya usase ‘hataash’ logon ko pehali baar ‘atmasamman’ kaa bodh hua
 Narendra Modi beats his opponents in many cases and seems to have a lot to learn from Modi on many fronts
 akhilesh yadav kaa bayaan ki vot matadaata ko samajhane se nahin bahakaane se milte he isaki ore ishaara karata he
 That is, Modi is giving his voters the confidence that they have not got
 misaal ke taur par notebandi se kisaan bhi pareshaan huye, chote kaarobaari bhi or garib log bhi
 The work was destroyed and many people lost their jobs
 purv vittamantri or congress netaa pi chidambaram ne kaha he ki upi or uttarakhand main mili jeet notebandi par janamat sangrah nahin kaha ja saktaa kyonki baaki teen rajyon punjab, goa or manipur main phir aapako iske ulat maananaa hoga
 Even after all the problems caused by the ban on demonetisation, if people vote for the BJP, then it must be believed that Modi succeeded in convincing the people that his move was against corruption, terrorism and black money
 jamini reporting karne vaale har patrkaar ne logon ke munh se ye suna – ‘haa dikkat to he lekin desh ke hit main he ye kadam
 'it is important here that this step is not only in the interest of the country, but the people are also engaged in personal interest
 modi ne logon se kaha – ‘unhone lutaa, main lautaaungaa’ or logon ko ye mahasoos hua ki ab wo un amiron ke baraabar ho gayi hai jinhone kaala dhan jamaa kiya
 It is also to be noted that the BJP did not give any Muslim a ticket in UP as it did in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi kaa kadam bhale hi hindu dhruvikaran ke liye ho lekin modi or amit shah kii jodi ne ise pragatisheel raajnneeti ke namoonay ko taur par pesh kiya he
 In the UP elections, the BJP has won a large number of seats which had a Muslim majority population
 jat bahul aabaadi vaale ilaakon main ek baar phir se bijepi kaamyaab hui he to usne devband jaisi seat bhi jiti he
 The comments modi ke mantri unke nerrative ko aage le jate hai
 That is why instead of making any harsh statement on the students of ABVP who are hoodwinks, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley says that India is the only country where it seems wrong to talk about nationalism, then Amit Shah uses the word Kasab for Congress, BSP and Samajwadi Party Even after that, people are able to say that people are bored of religion and caste politics and they want development
 yani narendra modi ne apni prachaar style se hindutv ke mudde ko chhadam secular vaad or tushtikaran kii raajnneeti ke khilaaf jang main badla he or ab sari ‘secular’ partiyon kii vishwasaneeyata khatm karnaa bijepi kii pramukh ranneeti rahegi
 Not only this, the way he has associated his economic move like demonetisation with surgical strikes and nationalism is a mixture that is making him popular among the voters of all parts of the country
 is takat se nibatane se pehle unke virodhiyon ko yaad rakhana hoga ki modi shiv ke avatar vaali chhavi hasil kar chuke hai
 In the last three years, Modi has climbed the ladder of popularity among common voters
 lekin kul logon ke liye wo divine avatar ban gayi hai
 The things he has included in his politics are also the result of social and economic equality and the appeal of the campaign against corruption along with nationalism

 His music training also began here and his association with Ganga
 khan kaashi vishwanath mandir se jude apane chachaa ali baksh ‘vilayatu’ se shehanai vaadan seekhney lage
 Remembering Khan, music teacher and singer Pandit Mohandev says, 'khan was a devotee of Saraswati beyond the boundaries of religion
 vah akasar hindu mandiron main shehanai vaadan kiya karte the, shehanai unke liye allaah kii ibaadat kaa bhi madhyam thi to saraswati kii vandana kaa bhi
 Through his music he gave a message of peace and love
 ’khan ke upar likhi ek kitaab ‘sur kii baradari’ main lekhak yatindra mishra ne likhaa he, ‘khan kehete the ki sangeet vah cheez he, jisamen jaat-paat kuch nahin he
 Music is not bad for a religion
 ’ kitaab main mishra ne banaras se khan ke judaav ke bare main bhi likhaa he
 He wrote, 'khan used to say that his shehnai is a part of Benares
 vah jindagi bhar mangalagauri or pakkaa mahal main riyaj karte hue jawan hue hai to kahin naa kahin banaras kaa ras unki shehanai main tapakegaa hi
 'india's independence and Khan's shehnai have a special relationship
 1947 main aazaadee kii purv sandhya par jab lalakile par desh kaa jhanda fahraa rahaa tha tab unki shehanai bhi vahaan aazaadee kaa sandesh baant rahi thi
 Since then, almost every year after the Prime Minister's speech on 15 August, the clarinet of Bismillah was played
 khan ne desh or duniya ke alag alag hisson main apni shehanai kii gunj se logon ko mohit kiya
 During his lifetime, he spread the magic of his clarinet in different countries like Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Japan, America, Canada and Russia
 khan ne kai filmon main bhi sangeet diya
 He sang the shehnai tunes for the Kannada film 'sannadi Apanna', the Hindi film 'gunj Uthi Shehnai' and Satyajit Ray's film 'jalsaghar'
 aakhri baar unhone ashutosh goarikar kii hindi film ‘swadesh’ ke geet ‘ye jo desh he tera’ main shehanai kii madhur taan bikherin
 Recalling the journey of Khan's music, Pandit Mohandev says that Bismillah Khan's music, which has been awarded with awards and awards such as Bharat Ratna, Padmashree, Padmabhushan, Padmavibhushan, is immortal even after his departure from the world
 bismilla khan ne apane liye vah mukaam banaaya he ki jab-jab shehanai kaa naam liya jaataa he unka naam sabase pehle aata he
 In a way, shehnai and bismillah are synonymous with each other

 However, traditionally the Prime Minister participated in the Ravana combustion program to be held at Ramlila Maidan

 Due to this, Congress leader JP Aggarwal resigned from Ramlila Committee

 In the Lok Sabha elections, under the leadership of Narendra Modi, the BJP managed to win 62 seats in Uttar Pradesh by upsetting the caste equation of SP-BSP-RLD
 is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main yogi sarkaar ke chaar mantri chunaav maidan main utre, jinamein se teen mantri jeetne main kaamyaab rahe hai
 These include two Brahmins and a Dalit face
 aise main yogi ke mantri kya modi kii cabinet main jagah bana paaenge?is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main reeta bahuguna joshi elahabaad se saansad chuni gayi hai or satyadev pachori kanpur se chune gaye hai or espi singh baghel surakshit agra seat se saansad bane hai
 While BJP candidate Mukut Bihari Verma lost from Ambedkar Nagar seat
 verma yogi sarkaar ke eklaute mantri the, jinhen haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa he
 Three ministers of the Yogi government have become mps, out of which two are said to be contenders for the post of minister
 espi singh baghel kabhi mulaayam singh ke kareebi rahe, kai baar saansad rahe
 But just before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, he joined BJP
 iske baad firozabad seat se chunavi maidan main utre the, lekin akshay yadav se haar gaye the
 This time Agra managed to win from the seat
 yogi cabinet main aakhri baar apni upasthiti darj kara rahe in mantriyon main se kuch chehre modi cabinet main ho sakate hai
 When Aaj Tak spoke to these mps about the possibility of becoming a minister, all the mps seemed to refrain from speaking on this issue
 espi singh baghel ne kaha ki dekhie yah pradhanmantri kaa visheshadhikaar hota he or jaise ki pradhanmantri ne apane sambodhan main kaha he ki mantri banane ke liye kisi ko apni utsukata dikhaane kii koi jarurat nahin he yah ek niyam ke tahat hota he
 Therefore, who will not become a minister, i cannot say anything on this nor will i be right to say anything on this
 modi cabinet main mantri banane ke sawaal par reeta bahuguna joshi bachati najar ain
 Whereas Satyadev Pachauri said that he is like an activist and whatever responsibility he gets as a worker, he has done whatever he will get
 yah pehali baar he jab pradhanmantri kii baat kaa asar chune hue saansadon par dikhaai de rahaa he mantri banane ke sawaal ko lekar sabhi batch rahe hai
 Nobody wants to express their opinion
 bataa den ki espi singh baghel dalit jati se aate hai or agra se lekar kanpur tak ke ilaakon main inkaa prabhaav he
 SP Singh Baghel holds good influence among the Dalit and obcs
 pashchimi uttar pradesh main kai siton par bijepi kii jeet main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Similarly, Rita Bahuguna Joshi was the old strongman of the Congress but when BJP joined hands, it became completely BJP
 elahabaad kaa becoground, hemavathi nandan bahuguna kii putree, uttarakhand main acha prabhaav, brahmanon par pakad or yogi sarkaar main safal mantri ke taur par inkaa kaarykaal rahaa he 
 In such a situation, both these faces are being speculated to join the cabinet, but after winning the Prime Minister's advice, the mps who have won are considered better to remain silent
 mana ja rahaa he is baar uttar pradesh se pehle se zyada chehre mantrimandal main shaamil ho sakate hai
 Faces like Maneka Gandhi, Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, Santosh Gangwar, Mahendra Pandey, Satyapal Singh, Mahesh Sharma, VK Singh have been ministers before and this time too many will make their way, so everyone's eyes are also on the new mps who for the first time Modi may be a minister in the cabinet

 yah ghoshnaa mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne buudhvaar ko bihar vidhansabha main rajyapal ke abhibhaashan par jawaab dete hue kahi
 Nitish Kumar echoed both the demand for caste census of RJD or the issue of restoring the old roster in the appointment of teachers in universities
 unhone kaha ki in donon muddon par paksh or vipaksh ek mat hai
 On the issue of appointment of teachers in universities, Nitish said that these are all issues which should be taken out and discussed in the House together and the proposal of the House should go to the Central Government

 nitish ne kaha ki anarakshit varg ke logon ko aarthik aadhaar par 10 pratishat aarakshan diya gaya he
 i do not think anyone should oppose it because it is not an intervention and the benefit of a separate reservation is being given

 2ji ghotaale main ek or khulaasa saamne aayaa he
 Aaj Tak has received information from highly placed sources in the government that Home Minister p Chidambaram, angered by the Finance Ministry's letter, wanted to resign, but the Prime Minister convincingly persuaded him
 chidambaram tak pahunchi 2ji ghotaale kii tapish |LIVE tvpiema ne chidambaram ko bharosa dilaayaa ki sarkaar unke saath he
 Not only this, the PM on his special flight from Frankfurt via New York also told the journalists that he had full faith in Chidambaram
 2ji ghere main chidambaram, patrakaron par utaara gussa2ji spectrum aavanton ghotaale main sarkaar ke do bade mantriyon ke bich jari ghamaasan kaa ye sabase bada khulaasa he
 It has been reported from sources that Home Minister p Chidambaram is very unhappy with the plea of pranab Mukherjee-led finance ministry to write to the Prime Minister's Office regarding the allocation of 2G spectrum
 2ji: chidambaram ne kii pradhanmantri se baat |news flashasutron ke mutabik jab is chitthee ko lekar media main bavaal machaa or 2ji ghotaale main tab ke vitt mantri chidambaram kii bhoomika par ungali uthne lagi, to chidambaram ne sidhe pradhanmantri se baat kii
 The PM was then on the way from Frankfurt to New York
 tasveeron main 22 sitambar 2011 kii badi khabaren |padhensutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik sanyukt raashtra mahasabha ko sambodhit karne ja rahe manmohan chidambaram kii peshkash se pareshaan ho uthe
 He explained for a long time to the Home Minister who was visiting the earthquake affected areas in Sikkim and tried to allay his displeasure
 sutron ke mutabik manmohan ne chidambaram se saaf kaha ki sarkaar ko unka puraa samarthan he or wo istipha jaisaa koi bhi kadam uthaane se pehle unke swadesh lautne kaa intjaar karen
 It is believed that after this conversation, the Prime Minister came out of the cabin of his Air Force One aircraft and made a statement in front of the media in favor of Chidambaram
 ajtak ke sawaal par piem ne saaf kaha, ''chidambaram jab vitt mantri the tab mujhe un par puraa bharosa tha or ab grahamantri ke rup main bhi ye bharosa kaayam he
 Not only this, the Prime Minister also rejected the assessment that the finance ministry's note meant something like a rift between Chidambaram and Pranab
 udhar, pradhanmantri karyaalay ke varisht adhikariyon ne ajtak ko bataaya ki vitt mantralay kaa note pradhanmantri ke disha-nirdesh par taiyaar hua tha or isamen aisa kuch bhi nahin he jisase chidambaram par ungali uthe
 However, to calm the dispute, the Prime Minister himself came forward and issued a statement, but should this statement of the PM be considered safe for Chidambaram? Perhaps, this will be a hasty conclusion, as the matter is in court and any adverse comments of the court may outweigh Chidambaram
 dilli ke greater kailash main DDA ke bhrashtachar kaa ek anoothaa maamla saamne aayaa he

 But there is no road here
 jab kisi adhikari ne nahin suni to hamane piemo ko patr likhaa or uske baad didie ke adhikari aaj sadak dhudhane aae, magar sadak nahin mili

 Also, many people also live here
 hamane jab didie planning diarector se poocha kii kahaan he sadak bataaiye, to diarector ne baat karne se hi manaa kar diya
 The planning director of the DDA was angry at us
 'unhone kaha ki didie ne ab is pure masale par chuppi saadh rakhi he or kaha ki is maamle kaa jawaab wo denge
 But do not know when to give it
 magar ab sawaal uthta he ki chaar saal ke lambey sangharsh ke baad ye khulaasa hua he
 But seeing this matter, it seems that we do not know how many such missing roads will be in Delhi

 Organizations of gas victims organized their joint press conference on Tuesday and expressed their anger
 sanghathanon kaa kahana he ki agar adaalat kii teesri sunwaayee main bhi daao chemicals kaa koi pratinidhi nahin aata he to isse centre va rajya sarkaar kii kamajori hi ujagar hogi
 These organizations raised the question that Modi has announced the 'make in India' campaign, but has not kept the condition of adequate security arrangements in the industrial units

 China has several dams
 bharat main aisi kai badi nadi hai jo china se nikalakar bharat main aati hai, jinamein se brahmaputra nadi sabase badi nadi he
 If China wants, it can leave the water on the dam for a few days, which may cause destruction in India

 It is clear that China has three such big rivers that can cause havoc in India

 Monsoon will knock in Kerala today? Monsoon may knock in Kerala on Tuesday
 mausam vibhaag kii maane to aaj kerala kii jameen par monsoon kii pehali barish kii phuhaaren pad sakati hai
 The Meteorological Department had earlier predicted the monsoon to reach Kerala on June 1, but due to the storm in the Philippines, it was delayed a bit
 mausam vibhaag kaa anumaan he ki monsoon agle hafte tak konkan main dastak degaa
 The three men were promised jobs as electricians in Yemen, but were tricked and taken to Aura, Saudi Arabia, where they were forced into a brick kiln
 is mudde par kerala ke mukhyamantri oman chandi ne buudhvaar ko bataaya ki rajya ke adhikariyon ne bhartiya duutavas tathaa keralavaasiyon ke saudi arab main sthapit sanghathanon se sampark kiya he
 According to Chandy, all possible efforts are being made to bring the three people to India within two days
 gauratlab he ki kerala se bahut-se log naukariyon ke vaadon ke baad bichauliyon kii madad se madhya-purv ke deshon main jate hai, or yahi bichauliye unhen human-trephiking kaa shikaar bana daalate hai
 The families of these three victims say that all three wanted to return to India, but could not return due to lack of means due to very low wages

 yun to puure north korea main kim jong un kii ijazat ke bina parinda par nahin maar saktaa
 Leaf also shakes there by asking this dictator
 magar kareeb sava paanch lakh feet upar ek aankh he jisane kim ke korea ko dekha he
 And believe what i have seen is very scary
 kyonki jis manshaa ko apane seene main ye taanashaah paale baitha he
 If she completes it then the world will not be able to live
 or lakhon log ek pal main phna ho jaaengen
 Because this time his preparation is of new doom
 koharaam machaa saktaa he kimasamandar se koi ghus nahin saktaa
 Will not allow anyone to come from the ground
 aasmaan se to parinde kaa par maarna bhi naammumkin he
 This is the place in one corner of this earth
 jo puri duniya se kati hui he
 But even then the whole world can not cut it with desire
 kyonki yahaan jisaki sultanate chalati he
 No one walks ahead of him
 usase panaah paane kaa sirf ek hi tarika he
 Not to go down his street
 or jaaoge to uske paas dehshat ke wo tamaam saamaan maujuud hai jo aapaki dahleez main aakar koharaam machaa sakate hai
 America dared to break the stubbornness of this stubborn dictator of North Korea
 kyonki samaaj main to khulaa sand bhi choda nahin jaataa
 This is still the one sitting with 5-5 nuclear weapons and hydrogen bombs
 or chhathwein kii taiyaari main he
 And if that happens, then believe me, no one will
 taanashaah ne kii he tabaahi kii puri taiyaarizamin se kareeb sava paanch lakh feet upar se satellite se kuch tasviren ain he
 That punjabi-ri site of North Korea is enough to tell that the preparations for another catastrophe have been completed
 or us tabaahi kaa test kabhi bhi ho saktaa he
 And if that happens, another nuclear bomb will come in the arms of this dictator
 phir ye khoonkhaar or khoonkhaar ho jayega
 In such a situation, if the pressure of America increases, then there will be war
 magar tabaahi aisi hogi kii andaaza lagaana bhi mushkil he
 Satellite photos opened Raj Since 2006, the North Korean dictator has already done 5-5 nuclear tests
 12 april ko uttari korea ke panjai-ri newclear test site kii satellite tasveeron main uttari portal ke chaaron taraf jabardast halchal notice kii gai he
 Not only this, many officers and staff have also been seen near the site's command center
 isi centre cmand ke ilaake main kareeb 11 upkaran yaa supplai rakhi gai hai
 Which can be a picture of the running of a group of people working here
 ban gaye hai jang ke halatudhar in tasveeron ke saamne aane ke baad america raashtrapati donald trump ne saaf kar diya he kinarth koreapar uske parmaanu yaa belistic missile kaaryakramon par roak lagane ke liye kisi sainya karrwai kii sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 And when Ehitayatan sent its strike group to Korea Proyadweep, these cynical dictators erupted and the situation is now becoming of war here
 dur tak hoga tabaahi kaa asaub maamla sanjeeda ho chukaa he
 The danger of rust has started to arise
 north korea or america ke bich jang kisi bhi vaqt shuru ho sakati he
 In such a situation, it is important that we know how far the devastation will reach if this happens
 kahin ye vishwayuddh kii aahat to nahin
 Because on one side the Arab country is sitting on the other side of the Korean Peninsula Jung volcano
 upar se america north korea ke taanashaah ko taish dilaane kii koi kasar nahin chhod rahaa he
 Now if there is a war somewhere, guess what will happen? The attitude of the missiles towards America is true that there is panic in everyone
 itminan kisi ko nahin
 Things are like this now
 ek taraf south korea
 The US, Japan and China are armed with their own weapons
 bas bigul phunke jane kaa intazaar he
 On the other hand, the North Korean dictator standing alone in the field is in a tussle about where he should turn his missiles
 isliye usne tay kiya he ki hamalaa kahin se bhi ho uski mixilon kaa ruukh sirf ek taraf hoga
 And that is America
 bakaul north korea ke is taanashaah kim jong un ke uske paas isaki vaazib vajah bhi he
 Because after the attack on Syria, now the attitude of America has become completely war
 isiilie usne korian peninsula main apane jangi jahaazon ko bheja he
 So Kim Jong-un has given America the last warning to be ready for war
 akele dam par jang kii taiyaarikim jong kii is jhunjhalaahat ko samajhnaa he to is nakshe ko pehle samajhie
 Because after this the picture will be more clear
 bhale yahaan se america kii duuri kareeb 10 hazaar kilometre ho magar south korea kii sarhad usase lagati he
 The distance of the other American partner Japan is just one thousand kilometers
 china se bhi rishte koi bahut behatar nahin hai
 Because Kim Jong is also afraid of poisonous missiles
 le de ke uske pados main rus hi ek aisa desh he jiske saath communiston ke daur main uskaa dostana rishta rahaa he
 But at present, the situation is such that North Korea considers itself alone
 akele hi dam par wo america se loha lene ko na sirf taiyaar baitha he balki barabari kii jang kaa dam bhi bhar rahaa he
 The Trump government is also ready
 On the other side, the Trump government of America is also sitting ready
 korian prayadweep par usne apane strike group bhej die hai
 Which also has Nimitz class aircraft
 uassoes karl vinson bhi or ek karier wing ke alaava do missile destroir or ek gided missile kruger shaamil he
 Now it is evident that if the United States shows its strength by coming so close to the North Korean frame, then Kim is not one of those who sit silent
 lihaaza hathiyaaron kii jang se pehle zubaani jang shuru ho chuki he
 northkoriyaka says that the decision to ship to America is a hasty step
 wo hamaari simaaon main ghusane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 If the United States wants to fight, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (north Korea) is ready for it
 china kaa maamla danvadolsyria par hamale ke fouran baad donald trump ke hausale kaaphi bade hue hai
 Therefore, the Trump Administration's decision to send warships to Korean peninsula is considered a final warning for Kim Jong-un
 haalanki trump ne apane adwisers se ye bhi kaha he ki agar pyongyang naram ruukh apanaae to wo duusare kai opshans par vichaar kar sakate hai
 But seeing the current situation, it does not seem so
 duusari taraf north korea par hamale ko lekar china kaa bhi maamla danvadol hi nazar aa rahaa he
 Experts believe that China is threatened by Kim but not so much that he stands with the US
 america bhi ye samaj rahaa he lihaaza usne ye bhi kah diya he ki china agar saath nahin degaa to wo akele hi north korea ke khilaaf ection legaa
 North Korea has nothing to lose, however, it will not be easy for the US to attack North Korea because it knows that this world's most cynical dictator has many missiles that recommend nuclear explosions to America
 north korea kii sthapana karne vaale apane dada kim sang kii 105veen salgirah ke maukey par aisi sambhaavna he ki wo chatha newclear test kar saktaa he
 In such a situation, if the conditions of war are created, then it can be said that America does not know but North Korea has nothing to lose
 sardi kaa mausam aa gaya he or isamen sabase zyada zukam ke maamle saamne aate hai

 Do you know that there are about 200 types of cold viruses that cause colds
 aksar isse nijaat paane ke liye log saamaanya dawaaiyon kaa istemaal karte hai
 In this state, the first 24 hours are very crucial
 queen mairi uniwarsity of landan ke wirelogist professor jon oxford iske shuruaati stage or isse mukti paane ke tareekon ke bare main bataate hai
 Professor Oxford told, 'these viruses that cause colds can surround you anytime and anywhere
 aapako shaayad andaja nahin, lekin ek baar saans lene par 10,000 se bhi zyada virus nimantran de sakate hai
 But there are only about 100 of them who attack the epithelium cells of the nose and throat
 inase bachane ke liye aapako kai vishesh baton kaa dhyaan rakhana jaruri he
 'how to get relief- Experts claim that a mixture of honey and lemon is very helpful in relieving colds
 - koi bhi kaam karne se pehle sabun se acchhee tarah haath dhoen
 Avoid coming in contact with any victim
 - saal 2000 main hui eues study ke mutabik, is condishan main chikan soup sabase acha khaadya padaarth mana jaataa he
 It is effective in giving relief as soon as possible
 - is dauraan aisi chizon kaa seven karen jo vitamin si yukt hon
 Also, if your partner has a cold, do not share beds with him

 america kii purv videsh mantri medilin albrit ne pakistan ko duniya ke liye khatra bataaya he
 Former foreign minister Albright made this statement in front of a panel on relations between the US and Muslim countries
 albrit ne kaha he ki ham din hamaare bich ke kai log poochhate hai ki duniya kaa sabase khatarnaak desh koun sa he, mere mutabik wo desh pakistan he
 After Albright's statement, it has become clear that the US also has strong news about the terrorism that is taking place in Pakistan, the terrorists taking shelter and the Pakistani government and army kneeling in front of them
 napak niyat vaale pakistan se ab america bhi pareshaan ho gaya he
 At least this is understandable from the statement of the former US Secretary of State
 albrit ne panel ke saamne mana he ki pakistan ab saradard ban gaya he
 Pakistan is one of the most dangerous countries in the world
 uske paas parmaanu hathiyaar, garibi, bhrashtrachaar or saath-saath charampanthi bhi hai
 Which is due to international trouble
 haalanki america kii purv videsh mantri albrit ne aatankwaad ko rokane kii pakistani raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari kii koshishon kii tarif bhi kii he lekin unke bayaan ke baad puri duniya ke saamne benakaab ho gaya he pakistan
 The Obama administration is already angry with Pakistan
 jaahir he ki aatankwaad ke naam par sirf badi-badi baaten karne vaale pakistan ke paas ab ek hi rasta bachaa he or wo rasta he aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai karne kaa

 But the real concern is of will
 baap ke marane ke intjaar ke dauraan sab apni apni chaalen chalate hai
 But in the end, everyone's pole is exposed
 or uske bhi aakhir main happy anding ho jaati he
 The story of Crazy Kukkad Family is tired and even in the screenplay, there is a brick somewhere and a snag formula
 small bajet film kii sabase badi takat uski kahani or parformens hoti he
 But here comes zero egg in the first groove
 parformens kii baat karen to beti archana ke role main shilpa shukla ne kamaal kaa kaam kiya he
 i wonder why this actress who has proved herself in many films like Chak De India, BA Pass, is not offering challenging roles
 bete pawan ke role main swanand kirakire ke hisse sabase zyada footage aayaa he
 Till now we knew him as a songwriter, composer and singer
 film 'sonaali cabel' main sharaabi pita ke role main unhone prabhavit kiya tha
 Here too he seems fine
 haalanki shuruyaat main vah jamate dikh rahe the
 But till the last, there was a bit of repetition
 iske alaava archana ke pati digvijay ke role main ninaad kaamat ne acha kaam kiya
 The performance in front of the mirror, especially in the costumes of the wife, was both fun and sensitive
 film main kai actor hai magar in teenon ke alaava baaki sab kaa abhinay ausat se kam hi rahaa
 Director Ritesh Menon used several tricks in the film
 'oomph factor' ke liye ek pakoda item song daal diya
 She put a desi girl named Cheri on her pretext
 kahani main green card ke liye kiraaye kii dulhan se lekar ge bete ke partner tak tamaam chaunkaau act karne kii koshish kii
 But everything remained useless
 film ke promo dekhakar kaaphi ummid jaagi thi
 It was felt that a good small budget comedy film will be seen under Prakash Jha's banner
 magar zyaadaatar niraashaa hi haath lagi
 The songs of the film are also average
 ek tasalli kii baat bas yah he ki film kii length bahut zyada nahin he
 If you can laugh at any such comedy, yaa phir apane parivaar ko ekta kaa paath padhaanaa chaahate hai, tabhi yah film dekhne jaaen

 (bhashaa) The Indian batting line-up collapsed after master blaster Sachin Tendulkar missed his 49th century, which reduced the hosts to 405 in the first innings till stumps on the third day of the first cricket Test against Australia on Sunday
 tendulkar (98) apane 49wein shatak se keval do ran se chook gayi jiske baad austrailian gendbaajon ne shandaar vaapasi kii or din ke antim ghante main aakhri chah bhartiya ballebaajon ko pavilion bheja
 Mitchell Johnson took five wickets for 64 runs
 pehali pari main 428 ran banane vaali austrailian team kal gharelu team par is 23 ran kii badhat ko badhaane kii koshish karegi
 Off-spinner Marcus North dismissed Tendulkar lbw for two runs before the century, shocking the hopes of Indian fans
 tendulkar kii 189 gend kii pari main 13 chauke shaamil the, jisamen se zyaadaatar point or extra cover main lage the
 Along with Suresh Raina (89), he shared a 124-run partnership for the fifth wicket and laid the foundation for a big score
 bhartiya team ek samay dabadabaa banaaye hue thi or tab score chaar wicket par 354 ran tha
 Looking at the brilliant game of Tendulkar and Raina, it seemed that these two would give a good lead to the team, but it could not happen due to the dismissal of the master blaster
 iske baad madhyakram charmara gaya, jisamen janson ne sabase zyada nuksaan kiya
 Johnson bowled out captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (14) and Harbhajan Singh (0) in consecutive balls and then took the wicket of Raina, who played an aggressive innings of 86 runs with 14 fours
 raina janson kii gend par pagabaadha out hue
 Due to a back injury, VVS Laxman (2 runs) came out to bat at number 10 with runners, but could not make any impact and was the last player to return to the pavilion
 isse pehle rahul dravid ne sar don breadman ke 29 test shatak ke ricard ko paar karne kaa svarnim mauka ganvaa diya, jisase bharat ne chaay tak chaar wicket ganvaakar 280 ran bana liye
 Dravid scored 77 runs and had no problem with the Australian bowlers, but he was caught by wicketkeeper Tim Paine as he touched the bat off Doug Bollinger
 dravid ne 205 minute tak ballebaaji kii or 134 gend kaa saamana karte hue 12 chauke lagaaye
 Tendulkar and Dravid shared a 79-run partnership for the fourth wicket, with the master blaster dominating
 tendulkar ne nau baar gend simarekha ke paar karaayi, jisamen se pehle paanch chauke point or extra cover ke bich rahe
 Master blaster Sachin Tendulkar hit the first four on the side with a slug sweep off spinner Haritz, then he crossed the ball over mid-on
 unhone sirf chauke hi nahin jamaaye, balki ek or do ran bhi batore
 Suresh Raina was also full of confidence and put up some great cover drives
 bhartiya team ne pehle satr main raatri prahari ishanth sharma kaa wicket ganvaa diya, jinhone bolinger kii gend par out hone se pehle 18 ran banaaye
 a total of 81 runs were scored in the lunch session, as the Indian batsmen were very cautious while playing ahead by 110 runs for two wickets
 Probably for the first time cheering a player in yellow

 chhattisgarh main congress kaa 15 saal ke satta kaa vanvaas khatm ho gaya he
 The Congress has won the state with a thumping majority
 raman singh kaa lagaataar chauthi baar mukhyamantri banane kaa sapana tutaa
 At the same time, Ajit Jogi, who has been the face of Congress for two decades in the state politics and is dreaming of becoming a kingmaker, has come fully on the road
 chhattisgarh kii raajnneeti main satta kii dhuree banane ke liye ajit jogi ne congress se baghawat kar alag party banaai or basapa ke saath milakar chunavi maidan main utre, par matadaataaon ne unhen nakaar diya
 Out of 90 seats in the state, Congress got 68 and BJP got 15 seats
 jabaki jogi kii party ke mahaj 5 or basapa ko sirf do siton se santosh karnaa padaa
 The Congress has got a lot more seats than the majority
 aise main use kisi sahyogi dal kii baisakhi kii jarurat nahin he
 In such a situation, Ajit Jogi's dream of becoming a kingmaker is completely touched
 itnaa hi nahin unhen dalit or adivasee belt main bhi karaari haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa he
 The Congress has won 12 of the 12 seats in Bastar
 jogi or mayawati kaa sabase zyada prabhaav bilaspur, jaanjgir-champa or mungeli jile main tha
 But in these areas too, Congress has eliminated them
 haalanki basapa ko pichley chunaav kii tulana main ek siten zyada mili hai
 Despite this, the key to power did not come into his hands
 bataa den ki congress ne pichley teen chunaavon main ajit jogi ko apana cheharaa banaaya tha, lekin vah raman singh ko satta se bedakhal nahin kar sake
 This time the Congress entered the fray without Jogi and without putting forward any face and returned to power with a two-thirds majority
 pradesh kii siyasat main congress pehali baar jeet hasil karke sarkaar banane ja rahi he
 After this victory of Congress, Ajit Jogi has come fully on the road in the state's politics
 jabaki isse pehle tak soobe kii siyasat ko apni ungaliyon par nachaaya karte the
 Where the Congress used to pressurize the high command, it made them realize their political power
 vahiin, vipaksh ke sabase bade cheharaa hone ke naate raman singh ke bhi chahete maane jate the
 But now after the result, they have become completely irrelevant
