 It is well known that getting good sleep is good for health, but a recent research has revealed the shocking fact that people who have a good sleep have a higher sense of gratitude

 Prior research suggests that gratitude leads to good sleep, but our research finds it in another direction
 kam sone vaale vyakti main kritagyata tathaa daan kii pravriti kam rahati he
 These emotions are very helpful in making better relations in the society
 dusron ke prati kritagyata vyakt karne se jaisi khushi milti he thik waisi hi khushi dusron ko kuch dene se bhi milti he
 According to new research, from Canada to Uganda, from South Africa to India, it has been found that spending more on yourself than spending on others is found all over the world

 For the promotion of the film 'tamasha', which is going to be released on November 27, its stars Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone fiercely promoted the film
 tivi ke kai shos main donon gaye magar ranbir kapur big bos ke ghar main nahin gaye
 Deepika went alone to promote Tamasha at Bigg Boss
 jab hamane ranbir kapur se yahi sawaal poocha ki aakhir vah kyon nahin gaye big bos ke ghar main 'tamaasha' ko pramot karne to ranbir ne kaha, 'hamane or marketing team ne prachaar ranneeti banaai thi or ham har jagah gaye magar big bos main main kuch nijee kaarnon kii vajah se nahin gaya
 Comments magar, ye nijee kaaran kya ho sakate hai? salmaan khan? kyonki salmaan is sho ke host hai? haalanki ranbir ne nijee kaarnon ke bich salmaan khan kaa naam liya magar ye ho bhi saktaa he ki salmaan khan kii vajah se ranbir nahin gaye big bos main or deepika ko akele hi janaa padaa kyonki sabhi jaanate hai ki ranbir kapur kii khaas dost katrina kaiff kabhi salmaan khan kii khaas dost hua karti thim
 Today, a lot of talk is going on about the marriage between Ranbir and Katrina
 kal yahi baaten salmaan or katrina ke bare main hua karti thim
 But Salman and Katrina split and Ranbir Katrina is together
 bataaya jaataa he ki ranbir or katrina ke saath hone ke baad salmaan or ranbir ke rishte karaab ho gaye
 Since then, both have been shy of facing each other
 aise main zaahir he ki kahin na kahin ranbir ne big bos main na jane kaa nirnay liya hoga
 When we asked Ranbir Kapoor the same question as to why he did not go to promote 'tamasha' in Bigg Boss house, Ranbir said, 'we and the marketing team had made a promotional strategy and we went everywhere but in Bigg Boss i Did not go due to some personal reasons
 'tippaniyan But, what could be these personal reasons? Salman Khan? Because Salman is the host of this show? Although Ranbir took the name of Salman Khan among personal reasons, it may be that due to Salman Khan, Ranbir did not go to Big Boss and Deepika had to go alone because everyone knows that Ranbir Kapoor's special friend Katrina Kaif ever Salman used to be Khan's special friend
 aaj ranbir or katrina ke bich shaadi ko lekar khub baaten ho rahi hai
 Yesterday the same things used to happen about Salman and Katrina
 magar salmaan or katrina alag ho gaye or ranbir katrina saath ho gaye
 It is said that Salman and Ranbir's relationship deteriorated after being with Ranbir and Katrina
 iske baad se donon hi ek duusare ke saamne aane se kataraate rahe hai
 In such a situation, it is obvious that Ranbir must have decided not to go to the Big Boss somewhere
 magar, ye nijee kaaran kya ho sakate hai? salmaan khan? kyonki salmaan is sho ke host hai? haalanki ranbir ne nijee kaarnon ke bich salmaan khan kaa naam liya magar ye ho bhi saktaa he ki salmaan khan kii vajah se ranbir nahin gaye big bos main or deepika ko akele hi janaa padaa kyonki sabhi jaanate hai ki ranbir kapur kii khaas dost katrina kaiff kabhi salmaan khan kii khaas dost hua karti thim

 "what does the voter mean where political parties raise funds?" unka matlab keval pratyaashee se he’’ —supreme court ko sarkaar kaa jawaab (april 2019)aparaadhiyon ko chunaav se dur rakhane ke liye sansad ko kanoon bananaa chahie —supreme court kii salaah (sitambar 2018) par sarkaar ne kaanon main rui thuns lee—''aapraadhik ricard vaale pratyaashiyon kaa byoraa pramukh akhabaaron main chapana chahie
 "no action on the Supreme Court's order (september 2018) to the Election Commission, the common people who have gone crazy by putting ink on the finger are made to take the responsibility of democracy
" The dirt of the few, the criminal leaders and the infinite electoral lies do not matter to those whom we are given the knowledge of 'first vote then refreshment' to choose! And what about those who came to power by vowing to make politics crime free! It was April of 2014
 varanasi se congress ke pratyaashee kaa naam hathiyaaron ke saude main aayaa tha
 At Hardoi's rally, Narendra Modi promised that "after coming to power, the government will form a committee which will ask the Supreme Court to prosecute the criminal record of the mps based on the affidavits received by the Election Commission"
 inhen jail bheja jayega
 Whether it is BJP or NDA mps
 "narendra modi jeet gaye or raajnneeti ko aparaadh mukt karne kaa vaada hardoi ke maidan main hi padaa rah gaya
 However, there were some stubborn people who reached the biggest court with a campaign to end the nexus between the politics and the jarayam
 supreme court kii paanch sadasyeey samvidhan peeth ne pichley saal sarkaar se kaha ki apradhi pratyaashee cancer hai, chunaav jitau pratyaashee ke tark se loktantr kaa galaa ghontna band kiya jaae
 It is the responsibility of Parliament to legislate and keep criminals away from elections forever
 is aadesh ke baad bhi pradhanmantri ko hardoi vaala vaada yaad nahin aayaa!chunaav ayog or sarkaar supreme court ke aadesh kaa itnaa amal bhi sunishchit nahin kara sake ki kam se kam apradhi pratyaashiyon ke bare main kaayade se prachaar kiya jaae taaki log yah jaan saken ki ve kise apana chaukeedaar banane ja rahe hai
 Now the Supreme Court has sent a notice of contempt to the Election Commission
 sanad rahe ki is loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle do charnon main 464 pratyaashee ‘apradhi’ hai
 Out of these, affidavits of 46 Chowkidars (BJP) and 58 Judicators (congress) have been registered
 anya pramukh dalon ke kareeb 61 apradhi pratyaashee (ediaar report) hamen hamaari loktantric jimmedaari sikhaa rahe hai
 We used to think wrongly that when there will be a majority government, a powerful leader, a party will rule in most parts of the country, then we will get such reforms in the shadow of which we can be proud of our democracy
 lekin ab to• jaraa-si baat par tunak kar karrwai karne vaala supreme court, elactoral band se chande kaa byoraa saarvajanik karne kaa aadesh de saktaa tha lekin usne soochnaaon ko filon main dabaakar agali taarikh laga di
 • The biggest court that struggled with the government on the appointment of judges could force the government to enact laws for criminal leaders but ended the talk by preaching
 • apradhi pratyaashee ke byore kaa paryaapt prachaar na hone par parche khaarij karne kaa aadesh dene main kya harj tha?is baar chunaav main votaron kii line notebandi kii kataron jaisi lag raheen hai
 Voters are laying on their democratic responsibility by meditating in the sun
 lekin jaise notebandi ke dauraan siyaasi dal, companiyaan or bank pichley daravaaje se logon ke vishwaas kaa sauda kar rahe the thik usee tarah sanvaidhanik sansthaaen vah sab dhatakaram hone dena chaahati hai jinke baad loktantr ke is sanskaran par bharosa mushkil se bachegaa
 There is democracy in many places in the world, people also vote, but there is a pet parliament, constitutions are raised, liberties are kept to a minimum
 satta ke phaaydon ko apane tareeke se baanta jaataa he
 We do not want a democracy in which the voters can fulfill their responsibility but the vote takers will do whatever they can with shamelessness! The difference between the voters and the rental crowd in the rally will have to be maintained
 matdaan hameshaa sweekaar hi nahin hota, ise sawaal yaa inkaar bhi banaaya ja saktaa he
 Voting is our strength, not compulsion
 bijepi ke varisht netaa or purv kendriya mantri yashavanth sinha ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki vah party nahin chodenge, lekin party chaahe to unhen nikaal sakati he
 Responding to a question regarding the continuous rhetoric against the party, Sinha said, 'my movement is not against any person and party
 meraa virodh nitiyon ke khilaaf he
 i am a member of the party
 main party nahin chhoduunga
 If the party wants to remove me
 'haal hi main banaae gaye rashtriya manch ke sambandh main unhone bataaya ki yah ek gaiyr-raajnneetik sanghathan he
 It includes former ministers and mps, including various party members
 sinha ne kaha, 'yah ek andolan he, jo desh ke kisaanon evam berozegaron ke saath he
 About BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha, other senior BJP leaders joining the national forum, he said that this is a sensitive matter, which he will disclose when the time comes
 sinha ne apni hi party kii kendra sarkaar par aarope lagaaya he ki vah desh kii jaanch agenciyon kaa durupyog kar rahi he, jisase desh main bhay kaa maahaul bana hua he
 The atmosphere of fear in the country, he said, 'there is an atmosphere of fear in the country
 desh kii jaanch agenciyon kaa durupyog kiya ja rahaa he
 Investigative agencies are being used against those with different mindset, due to which there is an atmosphere of fear not only in BJP but also in the country
 desh kaa naagarik hona bijepi kaa sadsy hone se upar he
 Being a citizen of the country, i am fighting the farmers
 unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi kii kendra sarkaar evam madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kii sarkaar kii ore ishaara karte hue aarope lagaaya ki dilli or bhopal main baithe log kisaanon kii jamini sthiti or dasha se anjaan hai
 It seems that no one is concerned about the farmers in the country
 'sinha ne kaha ki sarkaar ke aarthik surveykshan main berogari, shiksha or kisaanon kii samasya kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 This problem has not occurred in a day
 iskaa saaf arth he ki pichley teen varsho main sarkaar in muddon par vifal rahi he
 He said that the administration has behaved inhumanely with the farmers who are protesting against ntpc's power plant at Gadarwara in Narsinghpur district of Madhya Pradesh
 prashasan kii karrwai kaa jawaab ham denge
 He said that the state government is also to blame for this

 The Maharashtra ATS then arrested Sadhvi Pragya Thakur through a motorcycle used for the blast
 uske baad karnal purohit or ritair major ramesh upaadhyaay jaise logon kii giraftaar hui
 The ATS recorded the statements of several witnesses in the case, claiming that Sadhvi was also involved in the conspiracy to explode
 saal 2011 main jaanch enie ko saunp di gai
 After 5 years, on 13 May 2016, NIA filed a supplementary charge sheet claiming that the motorcycle used in the blast was in the name of Sadhvi but Ramji Kalsangra had been used and maintained since 2 years ago and claimed to be involved in the conspiracy The witness retracted before the magistrate in his latest statement
 isliye sadhvi pragna thakur ke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane ke liye paryaapt saboot nahin he
 In a way, the NIA has given a clean chit to Sadhvi
 enie ne sadhvi ke saath hi paanch or aropiyon ko bhi clin chit di he
 The NIA has also accused the ATS of fabricating the case for imposing MCOCA
 iske pehle 4 baar jamaanat paane main asafal rahi sadhvi ne clin chit ke aadhaar par jamaanat arji di
 But notwithstanding the intervention applications have been filed against him, an intervening petition has also been filed against the supplementary charge sheet of the NIA
 maalegaanv 2006 bam dhamaakon main muslim aropiyon ko kanoonee madad dene vaali jamiyat e ulema kii legal team ne buudhvaar ko adaalat main 2 argiyaan daayar kar enie kii supplementry chargeshit ko hi kaarij karne kii maang kii he
 The application states that the nia's attitude has changed after changing the government at the Center
 saal 2014 tak sadhvi kii jamaanat arji kaa virodh karne vaali enie ab use achaanak se kaise clinit de rahi he? The petition clearly states that the NIA is acting at the behest of the BJP government at the Center
 arji main aarope lagaaya he ki enie dwaara daayar chargeshit se lagata he ki aropiyon ko bachaane ke liye or jail se baahar nikaalane ke liye apane rajnatik aakaaon kii ichha par aisa kiya gaya he

 jabaki yahi aties maalegaanv 2006 bam dhamaakon main farji yuvakon ko fnsaane ke liye badnaam ho chuki he
 On September 29, 2008, 6 people were killed and 101 were injured in the bomb blast in Malegaon
 tab maharashtra aties ne dhamaake ke liye istemaal motorcycle ke jariye sadhvi pragna thakur ko giraftaar kiya
 Then people like Colonel Purohit and retiring Major Ramesh Upadhyay were arrested
 aties ne maamle main kai gavaahon ke bayaan darj kar daawa kiya ki sadhvi bhi dhamaake kii sajeesh main shaamil thi
 In 2011, the investigation was handed over to the NIA
 5 saal baad 13 may 2016 ko enie ne supplementry chargeshit file kar daawa kiya he ki dhamaake main istemaal motorcycle bhale sadhvi ke naam par thi lekin 2 saal pehle se uskaa istemaal or rakrakhaav raamji kalsangra kar rahaa tha or sajeesh main shaamil hone kaa daawa karne vaale gavaah magistrate ke saamne apane tazaa bayaan main mukar chuke hai
 Therefore, there is not enough evidence to prosecute Sadhvi Pragya Thakur
 yani ek tarah se enie ne sadhvi ko clin chit de di he
 Along with Sadhvi, the NIA has given a clean chit to five more accused
 enie ne maamle par macoka lagane ke liye aties par farjivada karne kaa aarope bhi lagaaya he
 Prior to this, Sadhvi, who failed to get bail 4 times, applied for bail on the basis of clean chit
 lekin uske virodh main to dakhal argiyaan daakhil hui hi, enie kii supplementry chargeshit ke khilaaf bhi dakhal yachika daayar hui hai

 How is the NIA opposing the bail application of Sadhvi till 2014 suddenly giving her a clean chit? yachika main saaf likhaa gaya he ki enie centre kii bijepi sarkaar ke ishaare par kaam kar rahi he
 The application alleges that the charge sheet filed by the NIA appears to have been done at the will of its political masters to save the accused and get them out of jail

 bihar main bijepi ke tamaam daavon ne dam tod diya
 Exit polls also turned out to be wrong
 bihar ke logon ne argedy or jediu ko hathonhaath liya
 BJP came in third in the state

 Nitish's work: Nitish got the benefit of the work he did in the last 10 years
 pehali baar schuli bacchiyon ko cycle di
 Number of drop out children from 5 to 14 years reduced from 25 lakh to 2
 5 lakh kii
 2

 The addition of Lalu Prasad helped the muslim-yadav factor

 sandesh diya ki jab tak bijepi ke saath rahe, modi ko bihar main kadam nahin rakhane diya
 Even now, Modi adopted the strategy of protest
 5
 And Reservation: In the absence of the face of the post of CM of BJP, Bihari vs Bahri made the issue
 sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat kii ore se uthaaya gaya aarakshan kaa mudda bhi nitish ke paksh main hi gaya

 What is the importance of Ekadashi fast
 
 
 duniya main sabase mahatvapurn or shubh faldaayi vrath he ekadshi vrath
 It comes twice every month - in Shukla Paksha and Krishna Paksha
 chandramaa kii sthitiyon ke aadhaar par yah vrath rakhte hai, taaki maansik rup se koi samasya na ho
 Keeping fast on these days keeps both mind and body healthy and does not bother common diseases
 man kii ekaagratha badhaane ke liye or man se sambandhit samasyaon ke nivaaran ke liye yah vrath achook hota he
 You should not keep any fast-fast in the world, but if you keep Ekadashi fast regularly, then you can get all kinds of success
 lekin ekadshi kaa upwas niyam se rakhane par hi laabhadaayak hota he

 Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh is guilty of many such serious charges in the rape case
 is fehrist main unpar saadhuon ko napunsak banane kaa bhi iljaam he
 a similar charge has also been leveled against Asaram Bapu, who is jailed for sexual exploitation, through claims that he used to impotent his servants
 akhir kya vajah he ki ye baba apane hi bhakton ko napunsak banaae jane jaisaa aniatik kadam uthaate hai
 400 Sadhus are impotent
 It is said that in 2007 Ram Kheem Singh, the former driver of Ram Rahim, had revealed in a TV channel that not only sexual exploitation of women in Kiram Rahim's ashram, but sadhus are made impotent
 deraa sachcha sauda main sadhu rahe hansraj chouhan ne 17 july 2012 ko hoicourt main yachika daayar kar ram rahim par 2000 se 2005 ke bich 400 saadhuon ko napunsak banaae jane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 He said that at the behest of the Dera chief, teams of doctors of the Dera Hospital impoten the materials
 unhone 166 saadhuon kaa naam bhi bataaya tha
 Hansraj said that Sadhu Baba used to give him a capsule of drugs after the parting
 jiske baad uske saath kya hota, use bhi maaloom nahin hota tha
 Journalist's killer Sadhu was also mentioned in the petition by Hansraj Chauhan, resident of Tohana town of Napsunsukhatehabad, that Nirmal and Kuldeep, accused in the journalist Ramchandra Chhatrapati murder case, are also impotent sages of Dera Sacha Sauda
 jail main band deraa ke saadhuon ne poochtacha main sweekaar kiya ki ve napunsak he, lekin ve apni marji se bane hai
 The matter is currently sub judice
 asaram bhi banaata tha napunskayon utpeedan maamle main jail main band asaram par bhi napushank banaae jane kaa aarope he
 Shivnath, a former serviceman of Asaram, had alleged that Asaram impotent the servants with his claims
 shivnath kaa kahana tha ki napunsak banane kii dawa asaram jadi booti ke jariye banaate the
 Servicemen were forced to eat this medicine
 kyon banaate hai napunskasamajashastri professor imtiyaaj ahamed kehete hai ki aaj ke marden baba apane bhakton ko gulam banaae rakhane ke makasad se napunsak banaate hai
 So that he remains their slave mentally as well as physically
 nupansak banane kii peeche vajah ye bhi he ki insaan kii sari khwaahish hi khatm kar di jaae, jisase wo apane parivaar, ghar, khandaan sab ko tyaag kar unka gulam bana rahe
 The impotent has to occupy his state of mind through religious fanfare
 bhakt nahin gulam banakar karte hai yon shoshanprofessor imtiyaaj kehete hai ki jo bhakthi kaa siddhant he
 In this tradition, the devotee surrenders to the Guru and gets absorbed in his devotion
 lekin aaj ke daur ke marden baabaaon ne bhakthi ke siddhant ko puri tarah se badal diya he
 They misuse religion and enslave their devotees and mentally and physically exploit them
 yahi vajah ki aaj ke zyaadaatar baabaaon par yon shoshan ke maamle saamne aa rahe hai
 Unable to challenge his ambivalence, he said that Asaram used to eat medicines to increase his masculine ability, on the other hand would impotent his servants
 iske peeche ye vajah ye thi ki uski shahanshaahiyat ko koi doosraa chunauti na de sake
 In this context, all those tricks are adopted, due to which the devotees have been enslaving them as their slaves all their lives and they are silent on every wrong and right thing

 Angry Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar from UPA for the last few days did not reach office on Monday
 aise samay par jab unka mantralay kamazor monsoon kii vajah se sookhe ke halaat se nipatane ke liye intazaamon main juta he pavaar kii gaiyr−maujuudagi sawaal khadey karti he
 Especially at a time when many states are struggling in the face of drought and Punjab and many other affected states have started demanding an interim relief package of thousands of crores
 halaat itane gambhir hai ki kamazor monsun ko lekar pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii bhi chintaa badhati ja rahi he
 The Prime Minister, while interfering in the matter for the first time, issued the guidelines on Monday and said that the Center will provide all possible help to the affected states
 piemo ke note main kaha gaya he ki sarkaar halaat se nipatane ke liye taiyaar he prabhavit ilaakon ke liye puure intazaam hai or karnataka, maharashtra, gujarat or rajasthan par nazar rakhana zaruri he
 The PMO admitted that the effect of weak monsoon has started showing an increase of 8 million hectares of sowing area compared to last year
 Recently, prices of sugar dal and vegetables have increased and subsidy on pulses can be increased to BPL families

 The comments aise main sharad pavaar kaa mantralay se dur rahanaa bharat sarkaar kii chintaa ko badha rahaa he
 It is expected that Pawar will get out of the political arena and will pay attention to it because the weak monsoon has not only affected the sowing of important crops
 balki isaki vajah se kuch jalaashyon or nadiyon main bhi pani kaa str pichley saal ke mukaable is baar kam he
 The Meteorological Department claims that the monsoon may pick up in the next few days
 lekin agar aisa nahin hua to bharat sarkaar ko prabhavit ilaakon ke liye bade str par raahat yojana kaa intazaam karnaa hoga

 In such a situation, Sharad Pawar's stay away from the ministry is increasing the concern of the Government of India
 ummid he ki pavaar siyaasi uthaa−patake se baahar nikalakar is ore dhyaan denge kyonki kamazor monsun kaa asar na sirf mahatvapurn fasalon kii buaai par padaa he
 Because of this, the water level in some reservoirs and rivers is also lower this time than last year
 mausam vibhaag kaa daawa he ki monsun agal kuch dinon main jor pakad saktaa he
 But if this is not done, the Indian government will have to arrange a large-scale relief scheme for the affected areas

 input language input- bhashaa The Election Commission (EC) filed a reply in the Supreme Court on the petition of the Congress against NOTA in the Gujarat Rajya Sabha elections
 EC ne apane jawaab main kaha ki rajyasabha chunaav main NOTA, supreme court ke aadesh ke mutabik he or ye pratyaksh or apratyaksh donon hi chunaavon par lagu hota he
 The Election Commission also said in its affidavit that the Gujarat Congress petition against NOTA is an abuse of court proceedings
 NOTA rajyasabha chunaav 2014 se jari he, lekin congress ne 2017 main chunauti di he
 Whereas since 2014, 25 Rajya Sabha elections have been held from NOTA including Gujarat
 chunaav ayog ne apane halafname main ye bhi kaha ki 2014 main hi ballat paper main NOTA ke praavdhaan ke bare main sari raajnneetik partiyon ko jaankaree de di gai thi
 The Congress has filed a PIL on this, while it does not violate any fundamental right
 kyonki rhite tu contest vaidhanik adhikaar he, moulik adhikaar nahin he
 In such a case, the Congress petition is not hearable, it should be dismissed
 bataa den ki pichley teen agast kosupreme court ne congresski yachika par nota (NOTA) par roak lagane se inkaar kar diya tha
 However, the Supreme Court had said at that time that its hearing would be continued whether NOTA could be used in the Rajya Sabha elections or not
 court ne gujarat rajyasabha chunaav mendenautha ke istemalke khilaaf gujarat congress kii yachika par chunaav ayog ko notice jari karke jawaab maanga tha
 During this time, the Supreme Court had asked many questions to the Gujarat Congress
 court ne kaha tha ki chunaav ayog ne janvari 2014 main notification jari kiya or ab agast 2017 chal rahaa he, is bich rajyasabha ke chunaav hue lekin aapane kabhi ise chunauti nahin di? aaj aap nota ko isliye chunauti de rahe hai kyonki yah aapako suut nahin kar rahaa
 The Supreme Court said that even after the Election Commission issued election notification on July 14, you did not challenge
 ab chunaav aa gaye hai to chunauti de rahe hai
 The Supreme Court had told the Congress that you are a political party and any MLA could have challenged it
 lekin aap tab tak intjaar nahin kar sakate jab tak aap prabhavit na ho rahe hon
 It should also be noted that the 2014 notification of NOTA was done by the Election Commission for all states and not Gujarat
 congress kii ore se kapil sibbal ne court se kaha tha ki NOTA bhrashtachar kii resipi he
 Now elections are being held in Gujarat, they are challenging it in court
 gujarat rajyasabha chunaav main NOTA ke istemaal ke khilaaf gujarat congress ke chif vip kii yachika par supreme court kaarywahi kar rahaa he
 The petition states that the provision of NOTA is not in the constitution nor is there any law
 yah sirf chunaav ayog kaa circular he
 The NOTA thus violates the Representation of the People Act, 1951

 The court accused Nanda of wrongful conviction after the media sprung up on the matter
 unhone kaha ki nanda is cese kii sunwaayee tak pehle hi das maheene main jail main kaat chuke hai, unhen ab jamaanat de deni chahie
 In his bail plea, Nanda has told the court that the trial court accepted the statement of controversial eyewitness Sunil Kulkarni, who is not a believer
 nanda ne kaha ki kulkarni ghatana ke samay dilli main nahin mumbai main tha
 Nanda accused the police that he took Kulkarni's statement too long, as well as the court did not take into account the statements of other defense witnesses
 haalanki, police ne nanda kii jamaanat yachika kaa virodh kiya he or kaha ki yah ek saamaanya durghatana nahin thi

 ab ‘turbanetor’ harbhajan singh ne kaha ki vah jaldi hi antarrashtriya team main vaapasi karenge or phir se behatar pradarshan kar apane desh kaa naam ooncha karenge
 Harbhajan, who came to Jalandhar to start a cricket academy, said, 'I am doing my job naturally
 mujhe ummid he ki main jaldi hi team ke apane saathiyon ke khel sakuunga or main vaapasi karne ke liye puri tarah taiyaar hum
 Bhajji, who has been a member of the World Cup winning team, said, "I will return to the team soon and try to give better to Team India
" maine kaaphi mehnat kii he or is bich maine kai anya match khel kar apane cricket ko or behatar banane kii koshish kii he
 'harbhajan, who made his Test debut against Australia in 1998, said about the defeat of India 0-4 in Australian soil, we could not play the natural game there, but it can happen with any team and the team will soon It will overcome this and give a tough competition to Australia

 The off-spinner, who has been the most annoying to the Australian players, also said, "it happens in some series, but there is nothing to worry about

 ' ise sweekaar karne main koi buraai nahin he ki ham sabhi ke jivan main kuch aisi baaten hoti hai jo ham kisi se bhi saajha nahin karte
 Not even with your spouse
 ye baat mahilaon or purushon donon ke liye samaan rup se lagu hoti he
 Talking about women, it is often said that it is very difficult to understand the mind of a woman
 kuch aisi baaten har mahila ke jivan main hoti hai jinhen wo kisi ke saath share karnaa pasand nahin karti he
 Women also have their own reasons to justify their point
 haa, par is baat se bhi inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki wo jin baton ko chhipaati hai usamen kisi ke ahit kii bhaavana nahin hoti he
 There are many things that she does not even like to tell her husband
 yahaan aisi hi 7 baton kaa zikr he jo ek aurat apane pati ke saath bhi share karnaa pasand nahin karti he:1
 Women never tell their husbands how they felt in those special moments
 wo agar bataati bhi hai to wo puraa sach nahin hota he
 2
 haalankiye shaareerik nahin hota he lekin mahilaayein apane pehle pyaar kokabhi bhul nahin paati hai
 But she never tells her husband that she still has a soft corner for him
 3
 This is true in the case of most women
 lagbhag har mahila kaa ek sikret krash hota he jise wo kisi ke saath share karnaa pasand nahin karti he
 Maybe she can tell this secret to her friend who has full faith but never tells this thing to her husband
 4
 There are many such things between the husband and wife, about which there is no agreement between the two
 par kai baar ladaai or tanaav se bachane ke liye wo pati kii haa main ho mila detii he
 Mind is against this decision, but does not allow it to be revealed from the face
 5
 This is something that most women hide from their husbands
 ve kabhi bhi unhen apni beemaari ke bare main sach nahin bolti hai
 She does not want her husband to be upset after knowing about his illness
 6
 Every woman has a hidden treasure
 jo wo ghar ke chote-bade kharchon ko manage karne ke dauraan bachaati rahati he
 Although the husband does not have any information about this amount, but the wife does not back down from giving that amount to the husband if needed
 7
 Women tell their friends everything but always tell the husband that she has not said this to anyone

 00 AM: Today is Sachin Tendulkar's birthday
 sachin aaj apana 40waan janmdin manaa rahe hai
 Special on Sachin Tendulkar supreme court ne somvaar ko kaha ki agar kisi mandir ko sanvaidhanik adhikaar nahin he, to wo mahilaon ke pravesh par bain nahin laga saktaa
 The Supreme Court will hear the Ayyappa temple case in Sabarimala, Kerala on 8 February
 darasal is mandir main 10 saal se 50 saal ke bich kii mahilaon ke pravesh par bain lagaaya gaya he
 This practice has been going on for years
 iske khilaaf mahila vakeelon ne supreme court main yachika daakhil kii he
 The petition states that the ban violates their right to equality
 jabaki mandir ke board ne daleel di he ki ye pratha saalon se chali aa rahi he or ise lekar kerala hoicourt ne bhi mandir board ke paksh main faisla sunaaya he
 The comments kerala sarkaar ne court main kaha ki vah mahilaon ke pravesh par bain ke samarthan ko lekar apana halafanama daakhil karne ko taiyaar he
 Petitioner Young Lawyers Association stated that the earlier government had agreed to the entry of women, while the present government is opposing it
 court ne kaha ki agar sarkaar aisa kar rahi he, to vah jokhim le rahi he
 During the hearing, the Supreme Court held that the temple administration cannot ban the entry of women or anyone else except on the basis of religion, unless the temple has some kind of constitutional right
 haalanki nyaayalay ne kaha ki is maamle main vah 8 farvari ko sunwaayee karegaa
 Actually, the entry of women between 10 years and 50 years is banned in this temple
 ye pratha saalon se chal rahi he
 Women lawyers have filed a petition in the Supreme Court against this
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki ye bain unke samanta ke adhikaar kaa ulanghan karata he
 While the temple board has argued that this practice has been going on for years and the Kerala High Court has also ruled in favor of the temple board
 tippaniyan The Kerala government said in the court that it is ready to file its affidavit supporting the ban on the entry of women
 yachikakarta yang loyrs association ne kaha ki pehle kii sarkaar ne mahilaon ke pravesh par apni sahmati jataai thi, jabaki vartmaan sarkaar iskaa virodh kar rahi he
 The court said that if the government is doing so, it is taking a risk
 sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne kaha ki dharm ke aadhaar ko chhodkar mandir prashasan mahilaon yaa kisi or ke pravesh par pabandi nahin laga saktaa, jab tak mandir ko kisi tarah kaa sanvaidhanik adhikaar praapt na ho
 However, the court said that it will hear the case on 8 February

 ' It was only last month when Team India became the champion
 par england se westeindies kya pahunche, sthiti puri tarah se badal gai
 India suffered a defeat at the hands of the hosts in their first match of the tri-series being played in the West Indies
 par duusare mukaable main srilanka ke khilaaf mili karaari shikast ke baad to sawaal uthne lage hai ki kya yah vahi champion team he?mangalvaar ko khele gaye match main srilanka ne bharat ko 161 ranon se haraa diya
 Sri Lanka set a target of 349 runs for victory in front of India
 is lakshya kaa peechha karte hue bharat kii puri team 44
 Only 187 runs in 5 overs
 har cricket prashansak ke man main ek hi sawaal he ki itani jaldi aisa kya ho gaya jo team ke pradarshan main aisi giravat dekhne ko mil rahi he
 There are many reasons for this shameful defeat of Team India
 aaiye jaane inke kaaran
 
 
 Top order, open middle order failed When Sri Lanka set an impossible target of 349 runs in front of India, everyone's eyes were on the top order of the team
 par mahaj 12 ran ke score par rohit sharma kaa wicket girane ke saath hi bharat kii mushkilon kii shuruyaat ho gai
 Also Shikhar Dhawan (24) and Murali Vijay (30) could not do much with the bat
 sthiti itani kharaab thi ki bharat ne maatr 65 ran ke score par 4 wicket kho die
 Daromdar was on middle order after a poor start, but captain Kohli returned to the pavilion on a personal score of just 2 runs
 raina or jadeja ne pari sanbhaalane kii koshish to kii, par unka yah prayaas team india ko sammanjanak sthiti main bhi nahin pahunchaa sakaa
 What would you do with such bowling? When captain Kohli won the toss and invited Sri Lanka to bat first, the strategy was clear
 madadgaar pich kaa phayda uthaao or srilanka ko shuruaati jatke do
 But it did not happen
 bhartiya gendbaaj srilanka ke salaami ballebaajon ko pavilion lautaane main naakaam rahe
 After this failure, it was as if the wicket was dry
 srilanka kaa pehla wicket 38
 Dropped in 4 overs
 is vakt srilanka kaa score 213 ran tha
 In the entire match, the Indian bowlers took only one wicket
 aakhri overon main jamkar barase ranbhartiya gendbaaji kii sabase badi pareshaani rahi he deth over
 Often this weakness of our bowlers falls on the team itself
 srilanka ke khilaaf match main bhi kucha aisa hi hua
 Indian bowlers conceded 180 runs in the last 16 overs of the Sri Lankan innings
 aakhri 10 over main 124 ran or aakhri 5 over main 66 ran
 These figures show how the bowling of Team India falls apart in the death over
 maahi nahin to magic nahinmahendra singh dhoni kii captaini main magic he
 This is proving to be true in this tournament
 dhoni chotil kya hue, team kaa pradarshan girane laga
 In the first match, there was a thrilling match against the Windies, but the lack of captain Dhoni definitely missed the ground
 unki kami kaa asli asar srilanka ke khilaaf match main dikhaa
 Kohli could not get his bowlers and batsmen to perform in a way that would help the team win
 dhoni se thik vipareet kohli ke faisle team india par hi baari sabit hue, chaahe vah toss jitkar srilanka ko pehle ballebaaji karne kaa nyauta dena ho yaa phir gendbaaji kii ranneeti
 India's ambassador to the US has said that a section of the American media, especially the liberal section, is showing a unilateral picture on Kashmir
 aisa un pakshon ke kehane par kiya ja rahaa he jo bhartiya hiton ke khilaaf kaam kar rahe hai

 ''unhone kaha, ‘‘iske bajaay ve tasviir ke us pahalu par focus kar rahe hai jise un pakshon dwaara aage badhaayaa gaya he jo hamaare hiton se bair rakhte hai
 Shringla said that he and the Indian embassy here have launched a massive campaign to reach out to Congress members, senators and think tanks about the factual position about India

 According to the Indian Ambassador, the recent changes in Kashmir will improve the atmosphere and the move will be in the interest of the people of Jammu and Kashmir

 Attempting to change the name due to English alphabet, Minister of State Government Partha Chatterjee said that soon the special session of the Legislative Assembly will be called and the subject will be discussed

 It can also be called the group of death, but Matos, the coach of the Indian team, said that the players are positive about their first match and will try to give their 100%
 matos ne match se pehle kaha, "hamaare group main colombia, america or ghana hai jo bade str kii timen hai
 As a coach, i am preparing my team well

 Matos said, "when i signed the contract, i knew that he would not be able to play the match because of the card, so we had already found a solution

 com / boijux0bvh — Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) January 28, 2015 bacchon ke bade-bade skool bag to apane dekhen hi honge
 But now the leaning backs of the children who took the angels in innocent childhood from those bags, you hardly see in the coming time
 maharashtra sarkaar ne ab bacchon ke bag kaa bhaar kam karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Strict government on bags: The Maharashtra government officials had already warned about the huge impact on the backbone of children from heavy gardens
 jisapar sarkaar ne kadaa faisla lete hue bag ke saij ko simit kar diya hai
 Now, it is said that no more than 10 percent of the weight of the baby is heavy
 bacchon ko raahat?agar bachche kaa ausat vajan 30 kilo man le tobag kaa vajamb 3 kilo se kisi bhi haalat main zyada nahin hona chahie
 This decision of the government will be a big relief for the children of the state
 aluminium or ispaat par aayaat shulk lagane ke mudde par bharat ne america ko vishwa vyapaar sanghathan (dablutio) kii vivaad niptaan pranali main ghasita he
 India has said that America's decision to impose import duty on these products will affect its exports
 america kaa yah kadam vaishvik vyapaar niyamon ke anupaalan ke tahat nahin he
 "india has filed a dispute settlement dispute under the WTO on the issue of import duty imposed on some steel and aluminum products by the US," the official said
 ’’ bharat ne maamle main america ke saath baatcheet par jor diya he
 India has said that discussions are the first step to settle any dispute
 yadi donon desh baatcheet ke baad kisi aapasi sahmati par nahin pahunch sake to uske baad bharat dablutio vivaad niptaan samiti se maamle par gaur karne ko kahegaa
 The comments america ke raashtrapati donald trump ne 9 march ko ispaat or aluminium ke aayaat par baari shulk laga diya tha
 This move of Trump created a worldwide fear of a global trade war
 trump ne do adeshon par hastakshar kiye jisamen ispaat utpaadon ke aayaat par 25 pratishat or aluminium aayaat par 10 pratishat shulk lagaaya gaya
 However, Canada and Mexico were exempted from import duties on these products
 bharat ne bhi america se in utpaadon par aayaat shulk lagaaye jane se chhot dene kii maang kii he

 US President Donald Trump imposed a heavy duty on steel and aluminum imports on 9 March
 trump ke is kadam se vaishvik vyapaar yuddh chhidane kii ashanka duniyabar main paidaa ho gai
 Trump signed two orders imposing a duty of 25 percent on imports of steel products and 10 percent on aluminum imports
 haalanki canada or mexico ko in utpaadon par aayaat shulk se chhot di gai
 India has also demanded a waiver from the US to impose import duties on these products

 The United States has worried China with its decision, in fact, the US State Department has given Taiwan 1
 42 arab dollar ke hathiyaar bechney ko manjuuri de di
 This is the first of its kind deal with this self-respecting country since Donald Trump became president
 kyonki america abhi tak china ke saath ‘van china’ policy apanaataa rahaa he jiske antargat america china ko ek raashtra maanata he jisamen taiwan alag desh nahin he
 The sale of arms may offend China as China considers Taiwan its own share
 darrlas yah faisla america ne us samay liya jab america lagaataar china se uttar korea par parmaanu hathiyaar pratibandh lagane ke prayaason par roak lagane ke liye kahata aayaa he isliye yah sauda ek aise najuk samay par hua he, jisase washington or beijing ke sambandh prabhavit ho sakate hai
 a US official, on condition of anonymity, said that the weapons sold by Taiwanese, including early warning radars, are seven types of weapons, including anti-radiation missiles, torpedoes and SM-2 missile parts
 videsh vibhagaki pravaktaa hidar nart ne kal kaha ki trump prashasan ne congress ko lagbhag 1

 nart ne bataaya ki in saudon ko manjuuri se taiwan or america ke sambandhon se jude taiwan rilations act kaa ulanghan nahin hota he
 Significantly, US President Trump has been seeking help from China to rein in North Korea
 kaarobaari or udyogpatiyon par aksar sansadeey prakriya kaa istemaal kar sarkaar kii nitiyon ko prabhavit karne kaa aarope lagata he
 Keeping in mind the business interests, some motivated questions are made by mps and letters are written
 haalanki kaarobaari phaayde ke liye sansadeey prakriya kaa istemaal karne kaa yah puraa tarika he
 Some of these methods have been exposed over time and the parliamentary system has become aware of some methods
 nitiyon ko prabhavit karne kaa ek nayaa tarika inase kuch alag he
 At present, a large number of senior advocates are members of Parliament
 zyaadaatar raajnneetik dal inhen tarjeeh dete hai kyonki inase court ke kaam ke saath-saath sansad kii bahes jeetni bhi aasaan ho jaati he
 Its relevant effect was seen that the lawyer mps dragged the court's dispute into the parliamentary process
 desh ke mukhya nyaayadhis ke khilaaf laayaa gaya mahabhiyog prastaav iskaa ek udhaaharan he
 Why this impeachment is wrong? Impeachment is proposed in rare cases where a judge has a serious case of misconduct and there is strong and sufficient evidence against him
 lekin mahaj kahi-suni baaten or afvaah ko mahabhiyog prastaav kaa aadhaar nahin banaaya ja saktaa he
 The current impeachment motion has been brought without any concrete evidence and is intended to intimidate other judges including the Chief Justice in the Supreme Court
 congress party yah kaam bakhubi jaanati he ki kis tarah aesejajon par vivadakhda kar diya jaae jinke faislon se congress ko phayda nahin pahonchega
 Even a simple political expert knows that the current impeachment motion cannot get a two-thirds majority in Parliament
 isiilie is prastaav ke jariye congress kaa makasad mukhya nyaayadhish ko hataane kaa nahin balki un samet anya jajon ko daraane kaa tha
 The draft of the motion was weak
 The draft of impeachment motion brought by the opposition was very weak
 aise samvedansheel draft kaa jahaan trutiyon se mukt rahanaa jaruri tha uskaa aadhaar ek pukhta subut hona tha
 But if the draft talks about finding evidence, talking about investigation, then obviously there is not enough argument for impeachment motion
 daleel 1:sansad ke 64 sadsy prastaav dete hai ki bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish sambhavat: bhrashtachar main lipt ho sakate hai
 Rationale 2: 64 Members of Parliament claim in the motion that the Chief Justice of the country 'could have come under scrutiny'
 kya yah mahaj andaja he yaa iskaa koi saboot maujuud he
 Rationale 3: The 64 mps who moved the impeachment motion write that 'it appears that the Chief Justice passed the administrative order on the back date'
 kya yah mahaj shaq ke aadhaar par he?daleel 4:kya kisi adhivaktaa ko jameen aavantit karne kaa 33 saal purana maamla mukhya nyaayadhish ke khilaaf sabit hua duraachaar mana ja saktaa he?daleel 5:kya jajon ko cese aavantit karne kaa doosraa najariya rakhana yaa vaikalpik najariya rakhana sabit kiya ja chukaa duraachaar he?congress party daleel de rahi he ki mukhya nyaayadhish ke khilaaf unke aarope kii satyaapan sirf jaanch ke baad kiya ja saktaa he to kya is aadhaar par laae gaye mahabhiyog prastaav kaa makasad use sansad main paas karaane se alag he? Many things can be done with this computer and it can be used for many purposes

 Last year too, Simran's beauty parlor was attacked with a grenade
 is hamale main sirf dukaan ko nuksaan pahunchaa tha
 At present, the police is investigating the case but the needle of suspicion is going on the Hizbul Mujahideen
 bataa den ki hijbul mujahidin ne kuch din pehle pulavama ke kai ilaakon main mahilaon ko khaas taur se sena ke kaaryakramon or beauty parlor main nahin jane ke liye kaha tha

 is baar congress anna hajaare ke prastaavit anshan se nipatane ke liye takanic kaa sahaara le rahi he
 The Congress is now making a new move after the announcement of the strong Lokpal's advocate social activist Anna Hazare to go on hunger strike from August 16
 congress ne prastaavit andolan ke khilaaf esemas abhiyaan ched diya he
 People are being sent a special SMS from the +919212472681 mobile number
 esemes main likhaa he ki agar 16 agast ko anna hajaare anshan par baithe, to unhen bhi vaise hi kuchal denge, jaise baba ramdev ko kuchlaa tha
 This is not the only thing
 had to tab ho gai, jab esaem main yah bhi likhaa aa rahaa he ki 'forverd tu ol'
 It is clear from this message that this is being done as a well thought out strategy to crush the proposed movement
 bina register kiye numberon par bhi ye massej jabardastee bheje ja rahe hai
 This too is no less a crime in itself
 jin logon ne 'du note disturb' seva le rakhi he, unhen bhi ye esaemes bheje ja rahe hai
 Although messages were sent to those who wanted to join Anna Hazare's campaign, but for this, it was necessary to make a missed call to a particular number first
 baad main us number par massej aata tha
 But the present case seems to have more fatal intentions
 gauratlab he ki chaaron ore bhrashtachar se trast janata sarkaar se yah ummid lagaae baithi he ki vah majboot lokapal bill laakar desh ko kuchakr se baahar nikaale, lekin shaayad sarkaar kii niyat main hi khot he
 This is the reason why the Central Government is in favor of the 'government Lokpal'
 aise main agar anna hajaare yaa baba ramdev congress kii manshaa par sawaal uthaate hai, to isamen aashcharya hi kya he? jahaan tak public kii baat he, vah sab jaanati he

 Want to apane mantralay kii yojanaon kii samiksha karne ke liye yahaan maujuud athavle ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘‘narendra modi ek joshilay pradhanmantri hai
 He has taken a historic decision to repeal the provisions of Article 370

" ” In Maharashtra, a BJP delegation is going to meet Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari today
 mana ja rahaa he ki siem devendra fadanvis kii ore se kisaanon ke mudde par bulaai gai baithak main shivasena ke mantriyon ke saath sarkaar banane par bhi charchaa hui
 After this meeting, BJP leader and minister in Maharashtra government Sudhir Muntigwar said that 'good news' is coming
 baithak ke baad siem fadanvis se bijepi netaa alag se mili or shivasena kii us maang par bhi charchaa hui jisamen vah satta main baraabar kii saajhedaari kii maang kar rahi he
 But before this meeting, Sanjay Raut has tweeted again, in which he said, 'no land under your feet is amazing, yet you are not sure'
 raut ke is twit ko bijepi kii aaj rajyapal se hone vaali mulaakaat se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 It is clear from the attitude of the Shiv Sena so far that it is ready to form an alliance with any other party except the BJP
 isi kadi main sanjay raut ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar se bhi mulaakaat kar chuke hai
 Meanwhile, in Delhi, Sharad Pawar also met Congress President Sonia Gandhi and there were speculations whether the congress-ncp alliance would support the Shiv Sena to keep the BJP out of power in Maharashtra? No land under your feet kamaal he ki, fir bhi tumhen yaqiin nahin Amidst speculations, statements and developments in Dushyant Kumarakai, NCP chief Sharad Pawar has made it clear that the public has given the mandate to sit in the opposition
 abhi tak congress is samooche ghatnakram main chuppi saadh rakhi thi lekin purv siem or congress netaa ashok chavaan ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki agar bijepi or shivasena maharashtra main sarkaar nahin banaati hai to unki party or rakanpa sanyukt rup se aage kii karrwai kaa faisla karengi
 But he told where he would gather support for the majority
 kya vah shivasena kaa samarthan lenge or shivasena iske liye raji ho jaaegi
 In fact, it seems that both the Congress and the NCP are reluctant to form a government with the Shiv Sena and the major reason for this may be the decision coming on the Ayodhya issue this month and the decision on this will be the reaction of the Shiv Sena and its 'soldiers', This may be a matter of concern for the Congress and NCP if they are together in the alliance
 hinduvadi party shivasena pehle bhi centre sarkaron se maang kar chuki he ki sansad main kanoon banaakar mandir banane kaa rasta saaf kiya jaae
 If the ncp-congress elections later come together with the Shiv Sena in the alliance, then the Shiv Sena's reaction to the decision taken about Ayodhya could shock the perceived secular politics of these two parties

 It is heartening to note that there is awareness in India that 12,30,00,000 households do not have toilets and a population of 80,00,00,000 defecates in the open
 ise lekar sarkaar bhi gambhir he
 By the way, it is prohibited by law to clean someone's toilet
 lekin desh ke kai bhaagon main kuch log, khaskar mahilaayein, aaj bhi apane haathon se dusron kaa mailaa saaf karti hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement 'toilets before the temple' and later in his speech on 15 August, announcing the elimination of toilets in all schools in the next one year and open defecation by 2019, as part of the overall sanitation program is
 main behad khush hum ki aakhir hamaara netritv karne waalon ko abhas ho gaya ki gandagi se mukti ke bagaiyr bharat mahaan raashtra nahin ban saktaa

 i was born in 1943 in a village in Vaishali district of Bihar in a conservative Brahmin family
 jab main 6 varsh kaa tha to maine ek kathith asprishy mahila ko chhu diya or ruudhivaadee asprishyata ko maanane vaali meri daadi ne shuddh karne kii baat kahkar jabaran mujhe gaay kaa gobar or gau mutr pilaayaa
 His bitter taste is still in my mouth today
 main ek bade ghar main palaa-badha, jisamen 9 kamare the, par ek bhi shauchalay nahin tha
 i used to hear some sounds every morning while sleeping or in sleeplessness
 koi baaltee uthaa rahaa tha, koi pani bhar rahaa tha or mahilaayein suryoday se pehle shouch ke liye baahar ja rahi hoti thim
 If a woman fell ill, she had to defecate in an earthen pot
 kai mahilaon ke sir main dard rahata kyonki unhen dinabhar apane shouch ko rokkar rakhana padataa tha
 i have seen it all
 maine un purushon kii jhuki hui nazren bhi dekhi hai, jo din ke samay khule main shouch ke liye baithe hote the
 i came to understand later, this story is about 700,000 villages and hundreds of cities in India
 meri shiksha chaar skulon main hui
 Neither of them had a toilet
 patna vishvavidhyalay se samajashaastra main snaatak karke mujhe 1968-69 main bihar gandhi janm shatabdi samaaroh samiti ke bhangi mukti vibhaag main kaam karne kaa mauka mila
 The committee asked me to develop safe and affordable toilet technology and work for the honor of Dalits so that they are included in the mainstream
 ek ucch jati ke ek padhe-likhe yuvak ke liye yah ek galat kadam mana jaataa tha
 But it made a big change in my personality and changed the course of my life
 mere jivan main nayaa mode tab aayaa, jab main betia kii dalit basti main teen maheene ke liye unke bich rahane gaya
 At that time caste-system was at a peak in the country
 unke saath rahete hue maine kai chijen dekhin, jinhone meri ankhen khol deen
 The suffering of this class was painful
 tab maine apana jivan scavanjaron ke liye samarpit karne kii thaan lee
 i ignored the insults and taunts that were coming at me
 ab mere saamne sawaal tha pashchimi deshon main istemaal ho rahi mahangi kalash or siver vyavastha ke vikalp ke rup main prabhavi or sasti shauchalay vyavastha kaa vikaas kaise kiya jaae, taaki scavenging pratha roki ja sake or unhen kisi anya kaam main punervasit kiya ja sake
 i was not an engineer or scientist
 is vajah se shauchalay-pranali kaa avishkaar karne ke liye upyukt nahin tha
 But i used my brain, did extensive research, and with the help of the World Health Organization's book on the subject, invented a two-pit por-urn, disposable compost toilet in 1968 that was easily made from local goods, at a low cost Can go yah aage chalakar rashtriya or antarrashtriya str par maanav-apshisht ke niptaan ke liye behtareen vaishvik takneekon main se ek mana gaya
 For the first time, i had to struggle a long time to show its significance
 1973 main mujhe yah avasar mila
 The use of the toilet was successful and attracted public attention
 isse protsaahit hokar maine 1974 main shahari kshetron main 'bhugtan or upyog' ke aadhaar par saamudayik shauchalayon kii avadharana viksit kii
 It first gained popularity in Bihar and then all over India
 dhire-dhire maine is vyaavhaarik niti kaa vikaas kiya ki ek gaiyr-sarkari sanghathan sarkaar, sthaneey nikaayon, nagarikon or labhaarthiyon ke madhya kis prakaar ek utprerak ke taur par kaam kar saktaa he
 By adopting this path, Sulabh gave a successful example of partnership of government, non-governmental organization
 swatchta ke saath hi hamane dalit bacchon kii shiksha ke liye patna, dilli or anya jagahon par skool khole jisase scavenging or nirakshartaa ke unmoolan main sahaayta mili
 We have established vocational training centers with a view to providing economic opportunities to women and children
 kai saanskrithik pahal kii: hamane jati-bandhan ko todgaye ke uddeshy se scavanjaron ko mandiron main le jane, ucch virgon or scavanjaron kaa ek duusare ke ghar main aane-jane, antarjaateey sammelan or goshtiyaan yojit kin
 This changed the casteist mindset, relaxed the social bonds and started the process of breaking the caste-system
 hamane rajasthan ke alvar main bhi vyavsaayik prashikshan-centre kii sthapana kii he
 Here Dalit women are trained in sewing, embroidery and beauty care, which used to do manual scavenging
 2008 main prashikshan paane vaali kareeb teen darjan mahilaon ko ham neuyork le gaye, taaki ve sanyukt raashtra mukhyalay main fishan sho main shirkat kar international year of sanitessan main apni upasthiti darj kara saken
 After this, Sulabh made a foray into biogas, bio-fertilizer, liquid and waste management, poverty alleviation
 hamane sulabh international centre for acshan soshiyology, sulabh international academy of anvyrnmental sanitessan or dilli main ek anokhe sangrahalay mujium of twoylets kii sthapana kii
 It tells the story of the development of toilets of ancient times
 baharhaal, sulabh ne desh main jo bhi yogadan die hai, vah shauchalayon kii sankhya main kho jate hai, lekin hamaara lakshya sirf shauchalay hi nahin balki saamaajik badlaav tathaa maanviya vikaas he
 It is possible to end the tradition of open defecation by 2019, but the challenges are greater
 sirf rajya or korporate gharaanon ke talmail se yah mumkin nahin hoga, jaisaa ki pradhanmantri ne sanket diya he
 It also requires lively people's participation and well-planned plans
 yadi swatchta ko rashtriya prayojan ke taur par apnaane kii rajnatik ichhashakti ho or jaruri puunji kaa intjaam ho tathaa 50,000 prashikshit prerakon ke saath milakar ek prabhavi andolan kiya jaae to desh ke har ghar main shauchalay uplabdh hoga
 And then we will be able to say goodbye to open defecation by 2019

 Gilani refused to write a letter to the Swiss administration to reopen corruption cases against President Asif Ali Zardari
 jabaki nyaayalay ne unhen aisa karne kaa nirdesh diya tha

 The petitions were filed on behalf of Pakistan Muslim league-nawaz (PML-N), Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf (PTI) and advocate Azhar Chaudhary on the issue of Geelani's eligibility
 saat sadasyeey peeth ne 26 april ko gilaani ko nyaayalay kii avmaananaa kaa doshi tehraaya tha
 The court, however, sentenced him till the court rose or the judges left the court room
 is tarah yah sajaa maatr 30 second kii rahi
 During Tuesday's hearing, Attorney General Irfan Qadir said that the Prime Minister is not accountable to the court regarding the discharge of his professional duties
 sarkaar ne 14 june ko neshnal essembly main ek prastaav pesh kiya tha or use manjuuri mil gai thi
 The Attorney General said, 'we respect the court
 haalanki rajkeey sansthaanon ko apane bich takaraav se bachanaa chahie

 Arvind Kejriwal, the founder of Aam Aadmi Party, has lost his love for the media and now he is considering him as his enemy and the only example of this is the threat of sending the entire media to jail
 pichley kuch samay se kejariwal naaraaz chal rahe hai or uskaa kaaran saaf he ki wo chaahate hai ki media vah sab na dikhaae jo unki chhavi ko dhakka pahunchaata he balki vah dikhaae jisase unki chhavi sudharti he
 But the problem is that the media, which is uplifted, also downs it on its mistakes
 harsamay ek jaisaa rahanaa media kii fitrat bhi to nahin he
 At one time Kejriwal was fond of the media because he raised many big issues and connected with the public
 lekin baad main unhone apni raajnneetik party banaali or uske baad bhi vah ummid karte rahe ki unke har kadam kii vaah-wahi hogi
 But he forgot the game's basic rules
 ek gaiyr raajnneetik sanghathan ke prati media jitna naram rahata he utnaaraajanneetik dalon ke prati nahin kyonki vah jaanata he ki unka ekmaatr uddeshy satta paanaa hi he
 It is wrong if Arvind Kejriwal is saying that he is the most honest and does not point fingers at him
 wo jo kuch bhi galat karenge uskaa khamiyaja unhen bhugatna hi padegaa
 Like all political leaders, they are also hanging and jerking, making statements and reversing like them
 to aise main unka media ke khilaaf zehar uglana nirarthak he
 There is one more thing
 kejariwal ne bahut kam samay main bahut zyada prasiddhi paa lee
 This fame has started climbing his mind
 unhen ab yahi lagata he ki wo jo bolen un par gaur farmaaya jaae
 Everyone trust them wo agar galat bolen to un par dhyaan na diya jaae
 That is, be laddu in both hands
 aise main kuch bhi aisa chap jane yaa dikhaae jane se unhen gussa aata he jo unkemnamafik nahin he
 His problem is that he considers himself a special class politician
 or yahvishistataa kii unki avadharana unhen ugr bana rahi he
 They are not common because the common man is always ready to bear criticism, not special
 aam aadmi to aise halaat se juujhatarahata he
 Arvind Kejriwal is no longer a common man, he has become special and this anger is the same thing

 The BJP is expecting a sixth consecutive term in Gujarat, while the Congress, which has been in opposition for almost two decades, is expected to come to power
 - rajya ke chunaav parinaamon kaa asar varsh 2019 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav par bhi pad saktaa he
 It should not be forgotten that in the year 2014, Modi came to power only on the basis of Gujarat's 'development model'

 97 crore voters exercised their franchise

 The by-election is being held due to his death on 3 February this year
 mana ja rahaa he ki bijepi is seat se hukum singh kii beti mriganka singh ko chunaav maidan main utaar sakati he
 Mriganka may receive a sympathy vote because of the father's death
 haalanki, mriganka vidhansabha chunaav main kismat aajamaa chuki hai lekin sapa ke nahid hasan se maat khaani padi thi
 The opposition's stand on the promise of not contesting the by-election
 aise main vipaksh kii ore se sapa, congress or areldi hi apana ummidavaar utaar sakati hai
 Congress leader Imran Masood from Saharanpur is preparing to enter the electoral battlefield from Kairana
 sutron kii maane to imran ne congress alaakaman ko apni jeet kaa sameekaran diya he, lekin unki kattarwadi chhavi ke chalate party unhen utaarne se kataraa rahi he
 While SP is busy brainstorming about its candidate
 akhilesh aise ummidavaar par daanv lagaana chaahate hai jo is seat ko sapa kii jholii main daal sake
 The assembly election consists of five assembly seats under the Karana Lok Sabha seat
 is loksabhaa seat main shamali jile kii thanabhavan, kairana or shamali vidhansabha siton ke alaava saharanpur jile ke gangoh va nakud vidhansabha siten aati hai
 Currently, BJP has four of these five assembly seats and SP of Kairana assembly seat
 in siton par bijepi ko 2017 main 4 lakh 33 hajaar vot mili the
 While BSP candidates got 2 lakh 8 thousand and 3 SP candidates got 1 lakh 6 thousand votes
 sapa ne shamali va nakud siten congress ko de di thi
 Kairana Lok Sabha seat, a political history of the Kairana Lok Sabha, came into existence in 1962
 tab se lekar ab tak 14 baar chunaav ho chuke hai
 In these, Congress and BJP have been able to win elections twice
 ye seat alag-alag raajnneetik dalon ke khate main jaati rahi he
 Yashpal Singh won the Kairana Lok Sabha seat for the first time as an independent candidate
 1967 main socialist party, 1971 main congress, 1977 main janata party, 1980 main janata party (secular), 1984 main congress, 1989, 1991 main congress, 1996 main sapa, 1998 main bijepi, 1999 or 2004 main rashtriya lokdal, 2009 main basapa or 2014 main bijepi ne jeet darj kar chuki he
 The caste equation of Kairana has 17 lakh voters in Kairana Lok Sabha seat which includes five lakh Muslims, four lakh backward (jat, Gurjars, Saini, Kashyap, Prajapati and others) and 1
5 lakh votes are Jatav Dalits and close to 1 lakh non-jat Dalit voters
 kairana seat gurjar bahul maani jaati he
 There are three lakh Gurjar voters here, including both Hindu and Muslim Gurjars
 isiilie is seat par gurjar samudaay ke ummidavaaron ne zyaadaatar baar jeet darj kii hai
 Muslim politics in Kairana Despite Muslim population in Kairana, Muslim mps have been elected only four times in 14 Lok Sabha elections
 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi ke hukum singh ke khilaaf do muslim ummidavaar the
 The SP fielded Nahid Hasan and the BSP fielded Kanwar Hasan
 2013 main mujffarnagar dange ke chalate voton kaa dhruvikaran hua or do muslim pratyaashee ke hone se muslim vot bantane kaa phayda hukum singh ko mila
 Equation of votes: BJP got 5 lakh 65 thousand 909 votes
 jabaki sapa ko 3 lakh 29 hajaar 81 vot or basapa ko 1 lakh 60 hajaar 414 vot
 In such a situation, even if SP-BSP votes are added, BJP is ahead
 lekin 2014 or 2018 kii kahani alag he
 If the SP-BSP votes are seen in 2017 and the by-elections are estimated accordingly, then the sp-bsp's friendship may be overshadowed by the BJP
 aisa hua to phir kya hogakairana main sapa ke mul vot yadav mat kam hai, lekin musalamaanon kii aabaadi badi taadaad main he, jo sapa kaa hi votbank mana jaataa he
 While Dalit votes are very important in this seat
 upi ke pichley upachunaav kii tarah agar basapa kaa vot sapa kii jholii main jaataa he to bijepi ke liye mushkilen khadi ho sakati hai
 Whereas BJP will try to repeat history like 2014 by uniting their votes once

 patharabe ne kaha ki akalan ko lekar vah mantralay ke adeshon kaa paalan kar rahe hai
 These FTII students were protesting against the 'unfair' assessment of the incomplete diploma project
 kareeb 40 chaatro ne patharabe kaa gheraav kiya, jisase vahaan tanaav fail gaya or chaatr vahaan se tab tak nahin hate jab tak ki unhone 2008 batch kii adhuri film pariyojna ke jari akalan par 'uchit' jawaab nahin diya
 The comments isse pehle somvaar shaam patharabe ne kaha tha ki chaatro ne unka gheraav kiya, lekin vah 'surakshit' hai
 a representative of the students said that he had 'stopped' the director in his office, as he had 'decided to continue inappropriate assessment of film projects'
 apatiai chaatr sanghathan ne aarope lagaaya he ki akalan raajnneetik rup se prerit he or 2008 batch ke 50 chaatro se adhuri pariyojnaon ke kaaran 'zyada samay tak' parisar main rahane se chhutkaaraa paanaa he
 Pathrabe said that he is following the orders of the ministry regarding the assessment

 Amidst the unseasonal rains on the rabi crop, on April 22, when the Indian Meteorological Department spoke of below normal monsoon forecast of 93 per cent of rainfall, from the farmer to the head of the country, everyone was shocked
 khaskar tab, jab nijee kshetra kii company scymet ne ek pakhwaade pehle 6 april ko hi monsoon main saamaanya se thodi zyada yani 102 fisadi barish kaa purvanumaan jataayaa tha
 The gap widened when the Meteorological Department on June 2 reduced this estimate to 88 percent
 mausam kii bhavishyavaanee main do agenciyon ke akalan main thodaa-bahut antar hona saamaanya baat he, lekin mausam vibhaag se pehle apana purvanumaan pesh karti ai scymet or mausam vibhaag ke anumaan main itnaa bada antar ek dilachasp bahes ke liye kaaphi tha
 It is necessary to first know about the strengths of both agencies
 mausam vibhaag ke paas desh bhar main faile mausam vigyaan kendron ke jaal ke saath hi satellite or anya tarah kii suvidhaayen hai
 The government agency shares data with the weather agencies of 192 countries of the world, the United Nations and developed countries
 vaigyanikon ke 400 se adhik padon vaale mausam vibhaag ke alaava prithvi vigyaan mantralay ke vaigyanikon or anya vibhaagon ke bich research chalati rahati he
 The country's best supercomputers have also been kept for the season
 bhartiya mausam vibhaag ke mahanideshak lakshmana singh rathore kehete hai, ''aap itnaa samaj lijie ki mausam purvanumaan ke maamle main bharat duniya ke kisi bhi desh se peeche nahin he
 In many cases, we have expressed better forecasts from US agencies
 ''duusari taraf scymet ke paas choti, lekin furtili sena he
 Its team of forecasters has close to 25 scientists
 yahaan mausam purvanumaan kii kaman vaayu sena ke mausam vibhaag ke mukhiya rahe air vaais marshall (ritred) ji
 P
 sharma sambhalate hai
 Sharma also believes that the company's infrastructure is much smaller than the meteorological department
 unke paas utane tej super computer bhi nahin hai
 They have more than 2,500 observatories across the country, but their utility in predicting the monsoon is limited
 monsoon purvanumaan ke liye scymet global agenciyon se data leti he or jarurat ke hisaab se satellite tasviren kharidti he
 Despite all this, Sharma says, "weather forecasting requires long experience and better work culture besides computer capability and data generation
" ham yaheen baaki logon ko maat dete hai
 "not only this, where the Meteorological Department has government funds, the existence of Skymet depends on the profitability and the maximum number of clients
 rojaanaa 10 lakh se adhik pejavyuj jutaney vaali scymet website is tarah dizin kii gai he ki logon ko yahaan mausam ke bare main dilachasp jaankaree mili
 The company has a better marketing strategy
 ye pravritiyaan donon agenciyon ke purvanumaan ke swaroop ko tay karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaati hai
 The forecasts of the two agencies were not much different from each other in 2013 and 2014, assuming a 4% variation in their forecasts
 lekin is baar jab mausam vibhaag june main 88 fisadi varsha kaa purvanumaan lekar aayaa to usne yah bhi kaha ki july main 92 fisadi or agast main 90 fisadi barish hogi
 Regarding June, the Meteorological Department did not provide any separate forecast and the September forecast will be given in the first week of August
 yani vibhaag phoonk-phoonk kar kadam rakh rahaa he
 In contrast, Skymet took a risk, forecasting in May that 107 per cent of rainfall would be received in June, 104 per cent in July, 99 per cent in August and 96 per cent in September
 lekin pehle do maheene main uske purvanumaan nishane se bhatak gaye
 In June, 116 per cent of the rains came in place of 107 per cent, while in July 23 rains have received 24 per cent less than normal
 yani july kaa unka purvanumaan nishane se kaaphi dur he
 In such a situation, if its forecasts for August and September are accurate, then the forecast of 102 percent average rainfall will be in danger
 lekin is ganit ko khaarij karte hue scymet ke siio jatin singh kehete hai, ''july abhi beetaa nahin he
 Wait a little ham 102 fisadi barish ke purvanumaan par kaayam hai
 "they also say that the July forecast has a model scope of 16 per cent fluctuation and our estimate is for the entire monsoon
" ho saktaa he, unki daleel sahi ho
 But the question arises that when the forecast of every month has the scope of such a large model error, then why did the company take the risk of forecasting every month? And if the average of each month deteriorates after the average of four months is correct, it will be called Arrow or Tukka? By the way, additional rain in June, beyond the forecasts, means better farming
 rathore kehete hai, ''1 june se 23 july tak desh main 7 fisadi kam barish hui he, lekin june kii atirikt barish fasal buaai ke samay hui, isliye kisaan ke liye acchhee he
 "right there, Mathura's agriculture expert Dilip Kumar Yadav says," The farmer needs rain at the right time, not the data of rainfall
 '' yani macro iconomi ko agar chaar maheene kii barish ke ausat se matlab he, to kheti ko varsha kii timming se matlab he
 In this aggressive round of forecasting, a senior meteorologist at the National Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, Noida, recalls an important meeting of the World Meteorological Organization on June 22 in Jojo Island, South Korea
 is baithak main vaigyanikon ne mana ki puri duniya main uplabdh ab tak kaa sabase acha yani kapald dynamik model bhi monsoon kii bahut sateek bhavishyavaanee karne main naakaam he
 He says, "scientists there believed that you can call the monsoon normal or less, but it is not possible to make accurate predictions in percentage
 '' aise main manusan kaa purvanumaan lagane vaali agenciyon ko sochna hoga ki kahin badboli bhavishyavaaniyan unki saakh par sankat na khadaa kar den
 In an effort to strengthen the party in Odisha, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi will lead a 'kisan Bachao March' in Bargarh district on a two-day visit to the state from September 10
 odisha pradesh congress samiti (opisisi) ke adhyaksh prasad harichandan ne kaha, 'rahul gandhi do divasiy daure par 10 or 11 sitambar ko odisha aaenge, jiske liye kai kaarykram tay kiye gaye hai

 ' The Gujarat election was once again in favor of the BJP
 chunaav se pehle jahaan is baat ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki is baar bijepi ke liye jeet kii dagar kathin he
 At the same time, the results of the election dashed all these speculations
 is chunaav main ek baar phir sabit hua ki gujarat main modi kaa magic abhi kaayam he
 Although Hardik, Alpesh and Jignesh, the leaders who came out of the struggle, tried hard to end Modi's magic with Rahul Gandhi, but the results did not seem to have any effect
 alpesh or jignesh khud to chunaav jeet le gaye, lekin us tareeke kii siten congress ko nahin dilaa paae jaisaa chunaav ke vakt sochaa gaya tha
 Read, the boys won but could not shake the bjp's throne
 
 
 chunaav se pehle chaukadeechunaav se pehle hardik patel, alpesh thakur, jignesh mewaani or rahul kii chaukadi taiyaar hui
 Which fiercely attacked Modi and BJP in Gujarat election campaign
 in netaaon kii ore se ek aisa maahaul taiyaar kiya gaya ki puure gujarat main janata bijepi se khaasi pareshaan he
 Also, the model of Gujarat shown in the country is false
 prachaar ke dauraan in netaaon kii reliyon main bheed bhi khub najar aa rahi thi, lekin ye bheed vot main tabdeel nahin ho saki or bijepi gujarat main jeet ke aankade se paar ho gai
 Finally, at the end of Jhoki's election, full strength was given by Hardik Patel, Alpesh Thakur, Jignesh Mevani and Rahul
 inamen se kai netaaon ne modi par vyaktigat hamale bhi kiye
 At the same time, daily questions were also being asked from Rahul on behalf of Modi
 itnaa hi nahin rahul or hardik ne patel jati ko aarakshan dene ke liye ek formula bhi taiyaar kar liya tha
 Despite all these things, Modi's impact in Gujarat has not diminished
 modi ne bhi in netaaon kaa dat kar saamana kiya or har hamale kaa palatwaar karte najar aae
 Before the election of alpesh-jignesh, many political pundits were feeling that the impact of Hardik Patel, Alpesh Thakur and Jignesh Mevani would be seen in this election
 lekin jab nattejey saamne aae to baat ulti hi pad gai
 Alpesh and Jignesh themselves won the elections, but failed to get the Congress seats
 vahiin, modi ne apni badaulat bijepi ko ek baar phir gujarat main jeet dilaai
 Unsuccessful, Bajirahul Gandhi also worked hard in the Gujarat elections
 unki mehnat kii vajah se unki syrius chhavi ko lekar bhi charchaaen aam ho gai
 Along with this, Hardik Patel also gave a tough fight to BJP in the state due to Patidar movement
 saath hi jignesh or alpesh ne bhi bijpi ke khilaaf jamkar prachaar kiya
 But in spite of all this, the seat of the BJP was not shaken in Gujarat and now the BJP government is going to form in Gujarat

 Many people stay away from the use of ghee due to keeping themselves fit slim in modern life
 agar aap bhi unamem se ek hai to ab apni lifestil main ghi kaa welcome karne kaa samay aa gaya he
 Few people know that ghee has many benefits too
 aapako jaanakar hairaani hogi kii sardiyon main ghi ke istemaal se aap skin kii kai samasyaon se raahat paa sakate hai
 Let's know how

 Dark circles will decrease
