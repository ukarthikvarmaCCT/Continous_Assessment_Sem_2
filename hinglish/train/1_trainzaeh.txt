 Terming the situation in Jammu and Kashmir as 'worrisome', senior BJP leader LK Advani said the state administration has completely failed and the UPA government is about to surrender to Pakistan-backed separatists
 hinsagrast kashmir ke halaat par charchaa karne ke liye pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii bulaayi sarvadaleey baithak se ek din pehle adwani ne vivaadaaspad sashastr bal visheshadhikaar adhinium (eexspie) main narmi laane yaa sainikon ko hataane ke kisi bhi kadam kaa virodh kiya
 He said that if this happens, it would mean "surrendering to Islamabad's strategy of breaking the unity of India
" ’rajya or centre sarkaar donon ko aade haath lete hue adwani ne kaha ki kashmir ke bigade halaat kaa kaaran na sirf umr abdulla sarkaar he, balki samprag sarkaar bhi asamanjas main he or dhulmul ravaiya apana rahi he
 Addressing a BJP workshop, Advani said, "with each passing day, our apprehension becomes stronger that the UPA government is going to surrender to Pakistan-backed separatists
" ’adwani ne kaha ki kashmir main ‘raajnneetik samaadhaan’ kii baat chal rahi he
 He said that instead of giving proper answers to the separatists, the government is calling the security forces as bad
 eexspie main narmi laane or balon ko hataane ke bare main lagaataar kaha ja rahaa he
 It is nothing but a surrender to Islamabad's strategy to break India's unity after 1947
 adwani ne kaha, ‘pakistan ke sainya shaasha 1971 ke yuddh main mili haar ke baad se isi baat kaa sapana dekh rahe hai
 It is shameful that a Congress Prime Minister gave India a historic victory in that war, while the other Congress government has been surrendering to Pakistan's proxy war against India in Kashmir
 ’bhaajapa netaa ne kaha ki kashmir ko adhiktam swytta dene kii baat ho rahi he
 He said that if it is interpreted, then it would mean giving pre-1953 status to Jammu and Kashmir
 anuchhed 370 hataane ke bajaay samprag sarkaar kashmir main samuhik rup se hamen hasil vashren or dashakon ke phaayde ko khatm karne kii taiyaari main prathit hoti he
 This is because the UPA government lacks will, attitude, commitment and competence
 adwani ne kaha, ‘main samprag sarkaar ko yah yaad dilaanaa chahta hum ki jab jammu kashmir vidhansabha ne june 2000 main tathakthith swaittata prastaav paarit kiya tha tab (centre kii tatkaaleen) vaajapeyi sarkaar ne use sire se khaarij kar diya tha
 He said that at that time Vajpayee had remarked that by accepting the proposal we would return to the old times and the natural process of harmonizing the aspirations of the people of the state with the integrity of the nation would be reversed
 agar sarkaar ise sweekaar karti to isse aise rujhaan ko badhaava miltaa jo rashtriya ekta ke liye anukool nahin hota
 Advani said that all of us are in favor of giving greater powers to all states according to the concept of federalism but in the name of autonomy, we cannot allow the process of integrity of Kashmir to be reversed
 kashmir ke halaat par apane alag sambodhan main party ke varisht netaa arun jetali ne kaha, ‘ham chaahate hai ki shanti laute
 But peace will not return as long as the separatists remain free and the army is tied
 ’unhone kaha ki bhaajapa kii ranneeti ekadam spasht he- suraksha paridrishy ko majboot karen or dusht tatwon ko nirankush nahin rakhen
 With this, the government can resume the negotiation process in the strong security scenario

 meri 13 saal kii beti ankitha ko blad cancer he
 It has been 45 days since the outcome of the diagnosis had created a stir in our lives, but my wife and i still do not have enough courage or temperament to tell her about it
 agar usne poocha ki kya uski maut ho jaaegi to main use kya jawaab de paaungaa, jabaki mujhe khud is kadavi sachai se apane dimag ko hataane ke liye apni puri takat laga deni pad rahi he?meraa naam basswaraj panch kaveri he, main chaar bacchon kaa pita hum or belgaum jile ke ek gaanv main rahata hum
 If i do not pay 18 lakh rupees in the next 30 days, the cancer will swallow my eldest daughter Ankita
 aapadaanake rup main jo bhi madad karenge, usase mujhe apni beti ke upachaar ke liye bhugtan karne main madad milegi
 Until a few days ago, i had never imagined that i would be living in Bangalore, several kilometers away from my house, looking at my daughter in a hospital bed and thinking of a way to save her
 is aspataal main aane se pehle meri beti ankitha kitne alag tarah kii insaan thi
 She was quite energetic, playful and full of life
 vah hamaare pados ke farm main rahane vaale pashuon ko kaaphi pasand karti thi, to jab vah skool main nahin hoti, main hameshaa use pashuon ke saath khelte hue paata
 i have seen him like this for a long time
 lekin ab doctoron, nurson or aspataal ke manahuus vaataavaran ne use kaaphi shant bana diya he
 i still remember that dreadful day
 19 june ko ankitha skool se lauti hi thi, ki usne bataaya ki uske pairon or pet main bahut tej dard ho rahaa he
 When i laid my hands on his forehead, he saw that he was meditating with fever
 lekin bukhaar se hone vaali is shuruyaat ne aakhirkaar mujhe echsiji aspataal ke doctor amit ji ke saamne baitha diya, jo mujhe ‘acute limphoblastic lukemia' shabd kaa matlab samajhane kii koshish kar rahe the
 i am a farmer by profession, so i could not understand what had happened to us till the doctor spoke the word 'blood cancer'
 acute limphoblastic lukemia blad cancer kaa ek aisa prakaar he jo pehle bone maro (asthi majja) main or baad main anya swasth angon main laal or shwet rakt kanikaon (arabisi or dablubisi) or platelets jaisi saamaanya koshikaon ke utpaadan main baadha daalkar sharir ko baari nuksaan or antat maut kii ore le jaataa he
 The doctor told us that if this type of cancer is not treated in a timely manner, it starts spreading very fast
 isliye ankitha kii jaan tabhi batch sakati he, jab jald se jald uski chemotherapy kaa satr shuru kar diya jaae
 At this time the pace of my heartbeat has decreased slightly, i was relieved to hear recently that there is a way out of this
 lekin aage mujhe jo bataaya gaya uske baad to main apane ko buree tarah se asahaay samajhane laga hum
 The cost of this treatment is so high that we have neither earned nor seen so much for life
 meri beti ko bachaane ke liye jaruri raashi chaunkaane vaali, 18 lakh rupee he
 i remember when i first heard this, i was shocked
 iske baad to mere dimag main or koi baat ai hi nahin ki doctor aage kya kah rahe hai
 My daughter has cancer! i could not understand what to do next
 aise mushkil samay main aapke aasapaas ke logon kaa sahyog hi aapako bana yaa bigaad saktaa he
 i am lucky to have such relatives and well-wishers who helped financially, whatever their capacity may be
 unhone to apana vishaal hriday dikhaate hue meri madad kii, lekin iske baavjood ilaaj kaa jo kharch tha uske saamne yah kuch bhi nahin tha
 i was able to earn only 2000 rupees a month and that too stopped because i had to live here with my daughter in Bengaluru
 maine apane saare jevaraat or keemtee saamaan bech die
 My wife earns about 300 rupees every week by doing small business of food and drink, but what was going to happen even better
 aspataal bengalooru main he, isliye main apni patni ke saath yahaan chota sa cameraa lekar rahane laga jiskaa kiraaya hi 300 rupaya prati tha
 The doctors said that we will have to stay in this city for many more months, which means that our expenses are going to increase more and more
 thodaa-thodaa karke maine kareeb 4 lakh rupee jutaaye
 There was nothing more i could do, but it was less than half of what we needed
 hamane apane sabhi sansadhano kaa istemaal kar liya he
 What do i do now? Where do i get money to save my daughter? If i went home without him, how would i face his siblings? i could see everything that could happen to me
 ab meri antim ummid un logon se miladanhi he, jinhone meri kahani padhi he, taaki main ankitha ko bachaa sakuun
 Every night when i sleep, i pray to God that a miracle happens - i ask God to either cure my daughter's cancer or give money for her treatment
 ab yah din-ba-din kathin hota ja rahaa he ki main ankitha ke aasapaas rahun or apane aansuon ko roak paaun
 She wants to go back to her school, spend time with her siblings and play with her friends, but instead has to undergo all the painful tests, she is most likely to have this 'stomach infection' Awaiting long treatment is over
 mujhe aisa lagata he ki main ek asafal pita hum
 Knowing that if i do not raise money on time, i can lose it, i am trying to spend more and more time with him
 ab mujhe kya karnaa chahie? uskaa jivan bachaane ke liye is asambhav jaisi raashi ko jutaney kii koshish jari rakhun yaa uske jivan ke bache is simit samay ko uske saath bitaauun?aap basswaraj kii madadkettoper unke funderejar ko daan dekar kar sakate hai

 Prime Minister Imran Khan's visit to gilgit-baltistan canceled Imran, not due to bad weather, Imran Khan's first Gilgit visit after becoming Prime Minister of Pakistan, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's visit to gilgit-baltistan has been canceled
 vah kuch der pehle hi skardu pahunche the or vahaan vah ek jansabha ko sambodhit karne vaale the
 But according to sources associated with the ruling PTI, this public meeting has been canceled due to bad weather
 pradhanmantri imran khan ko aaj skardu ke nagar nigam ground main jansabha ko sambodhit karnaa tha jahaan vah kshetra ke vikaas ke liye ek bade package kaa elaan karne vaale the, lekin kharaab mausam ke kaaran imran ko yah jansabha radd kerani padi
 The first round of gilgit-baltistan was the first visit to gilgit-baltistan after Imran Khan became Prime Minister
 kashmir maamalon or gilggit-baltistan ke sangheey mantri ali amin gandapur, gilggit-baltistan ke mukhyamantri hafijur rahamaan, governor raja jalaal hossain makapon, pakistan taharik-e-insaaf ke gilggit-baltistan shakha ke adhyaksh saiyad jafar shah or kai kendriya mantrimandal ke sadsy skardu main maujuud the
 Their effort was to make Prime Minister Imran Khan's program successful, but it could not happen due to bad weather
 jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 ko nishprabhavi kiye jane or vishesh rajya kaa darja khatm kiye jane ke baad se hi imran khan lagaataar paak adhikrut kashmir kaa daura kar rahe hai
 Last month, after 'kashmir Hour', Imran Khan said in a big prom on September 13 in Muzaffarabad, the capital of pok, that Kashmir would be raised again in the UNGA
 aarthik hiton ke kaaran muslim deshon ne bhi is masale par hamaara saath nahin diya
 Then Prime Minister Imran Khan had said, 'I know that many of you have tried to cross the line of control, but i tell you today that there is no need to go to the line of control
 aap log tab line of control janaa jab main aapse jane ko kahuun
 'demonstration against Pakistan: The region of galgit-baltistan is counted in disputed areas of Pakistan and there are frequent demonstrations against the government of Pakistan
 vivaad tab bad gaya jab mahaj ek saal pehle usne gilgit-baltistan ke nivaasiyon ke sabhi adhikaar avaidh rup se radd kar die the
 The gilgit-baltistan Order 2018 abolished all the powers of the Gilgit Baltistan Council and delegated full authority over the territory to the Prime Minister of Pakistan
 is aadesh ke tahat, sthaneey nikaayon ke sabhi adhikaar chin liye gaye or yahaan tak ki kar lagane kaa adhikaar bhi pakistan ke pradhanmantri ko saunp diya gaya, jise court tak main chunauti nahin di ja sakati
 When did Pakistan forcefully occupy it? Pakistan's Prime Minister cleared his way to elect the officials of the judiciary by interfering in the judicial system of gilgit-baltistan as well
 sthaneey logon ne is kadam ko kshetra ke logon kaa bhavishya main daman karne vaala bataaya
 Pakistan had forcibly annexed the area in 1947 and has been illegally occupied since then
 pichley saal bharat ne pakistan sarkaar ke is kadam kaa kadaa virodh kiya tha
 On 27 May 2018, the Ministry of External Affairs summoned the Deputy High Commissioner of Pakistan to Delhi and told them clearly that the entire territory of Jammu and Kashmir, including gilgit-baltistan, is an internal part of India on the basis of partition in 1947
 bharat kii ore se pakistani rajanyik ko jaankaree di gai ki pakistan dwaara kshetra ke kisi hisse kii sthiti ko jabaran badalane ke liye kii gai koi bhi karrwai vaid nahin maani jaaegi or naa sweekaar kii jaaegi
 Pakistan should vacate the illegally occupied area immediately, rather than seeking to change the boundaries of the occupied territories

 imef kii prabandh nideshak christine leguard ne kaha ki vah america or china ko yah salaah dengi ki ve thande dimag se vichaar karen or duniya kii vyapaar pranali ko durust karne main madad karen, use tode nahin
 China may be defeated by the US in the currency war, government companies may be defaulters and World Bank President Jim Yong Kim put their views in separate talks at the annual meeting of IMF and World Bank
 yah baithak indonesia ke bali dweep main ho rahi he
 Finance ministers and central banks from many countries of the world are participating in this event
 america or china ke bich badhate vivaad ke bare main puche jane par leguard ne kaha ki donon deshon ne ek duusare ke niryaat par jo atirikt shulk lagaaya he usase abhi adhik kshati nahin hui he lekin is baat kaa jokhim bana hua he ki isse anya deshon ko nuksaan pahunch saktaa he

legaard has given three recommendations to Donald Trump and Xi Jinping

 Don't break it unhone kaha ki geneva sthit niyam banane vaale vishwa vyapaar sanghathan (dablutio) ke paas america kii shikaayat ko hal karne ke tareeke hai
 The US complains that China's policies are improperly mobilizing modern technology, causing losses to foreign companies

 a senior government source said, 'if the license expires, then who will go to the Supreme Court
 in muddon par nishchit rup se faisla hona he
 But of course their business cannot be completely closed
 kuch na kuch to karnaa hi hoga
 The source, however, did not clarify whether the government will go to the Supreme Court seeking extension of the license till the next auction is completed
 sutara ne kaha ki yah mudda mantri str par tay ho jayega
 There will be no need to go to the Empowered Group of Ministers for this
 pichley saal farvari main jin doorsanchaar companiyon kaa license ucchtam nyaayalay ke aadesh se radd hua he unako 18 janvari, 2013 tak parichaalan kii anumati he
 After that, they will be able to continue operations only if they have acquired spectrum in the auction

 Work was done on the ground in the last assembly and corporation elections, but the party's internal schism did not send a good message to the workers and in the results the party was completely defeated

 unhone kaha ki congress jo kahati he wo karti he jabaki, aam aadmi party ne jo vaayade kiye the wo nahin nibhaae
 Not all people are getting free electricity and water
 mahangaai ke kaaran mahilaon kaa ghar kaa bajet bigadaa hua he, yuvaaon ko naukari nahin mil paa rahi he

 Ever since Arvind Kejriwal's government came, neither the pension nor the roads and bridges are being built in Delhi
 ajay makanne kaha ki shila ji kii sarkaar ke samay rashan card banate the
 Now neither ration cards are being made nor old people are getting pension, in such a situation, there is a need only to overthrow the Kejriwal government with false promises
 ajay maakan ne janata se aavahan kiya ki 20 vidhansabha siton ke chunaav main ek baar phir se unhen mauka milegaa or vah apana sahi mat sahi party ko dekar use vijay banaaen

 Through the Wayanad seat, Rahul is embarking on a strategy to cover entire South India including Kerala
 rahul gandhi 'gandhi parivaar' ke pehle shaks nahin he jo dakshin ke ran main utar rahe hai balki unase pehle maa sonia gandhi or daadi indira gandhi bhi dakshin bharat se chunaav lard chuki hai
 Along with indira-sonia's political advantage, the Congress party has also benefited
 bataa den ki dakshin bharat main aisi lagaataar maang uthati rahi he ki dilli kii satta ke singhaasana par unka pratinidhatv ho
 In view of this, Rahul Gandhi has decided to contest from Wayanad to win the heart of South India on the lines of his mother and grandmother
 rahul ne apni paramparaagat seat amethi se chunaav ladane ke saath-saath congress liye majboot kile ke rup main mashhoor vynad seat ko bhi chunaa he
 Indira Gandhi fought from Chikkamagaluru, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi has been the first member of the 'gandhi family', which had contested from South India
 1977 main raibareli seat se raaj narayan se haarane ke baad indira gandhi 1978 main karnataka kii chikmagalore loksabhaa seat se upachunaav main utari thim
 Indira's entry into the electoral fray from here was like Sanjeevani for the Congress
 do saal ke baad 1980 main loksabhaa chunaav hue to karnataka (tatkaaleen mysore) kii sabhi 27 sansadeey siten congress jeetne main safal rahi thi
 Sonia Gandhi contested from Amethi and Bellary, Sonia Gandhi as the second member of the 'gandhi family' after Indira Gandhi in the political battlefield of South India
 sonia gandhi ne 1998 main raajnneeti main kadam rakhane baad 1999 ke loksabhaa chunaav main amethi ke saath-saath karnataka kii bellari sansadeey se chunaav maidan main kismat aajamaai thi
 BJP had fielded Sushma Swaraj against Sonia
 sonia gandhi ne is seat par kareeb 56 hajaar maton se jeet hasil kii thi
 The Congress had gained in this way, the Congress also got a tremendous advantage by landing in political battle of Karnataka
 karnataka kii 28 loksabhaa siton main se congress ko 18 siten mili thim
 At the same time, BJP had to satisfy 7 and Janata Dal with 3 seats
 jabaki isse pehle congress kii paanch siten thim
 In this way, the party had gained 11 seats
 maa or daadi kii tarj par rahul gandhi ne amethi ke saath-saath kerala kii vynad seat ko bhi chunaa he
 Out of the total 20 Lok Sabha seats in Kerala, Congress currently holds just 8 seats
 is tarah se rahul ke saamne apni seat jeetne ke saath-saath kerala main seat badhaane kii chunauti he
 Apart from this, there is a big challenge to bring back the lost base of Congress in South India

 He said that it is the dream of the railways not to travel more than 12 hours from one part of India to another, for which it is intended to increase the average speed of all trains so that all people can benefit from it
 jahaan tak ultrahai speedcnic kaa masalaa he, bhartiya railway ise ‘mek in india’ ke tahat viksit evam lagu karnaa chaahati he, taaki iskaa istemaal desh main ho sake or iske saath hi railway iskaa niryaat karne main bhi samarth ho sake

 Earlier, there were two types of vegetables, tadka dal, salad and raita in thalis

 Because onions and tomatoes have disappeared from salads

 The plates of the houses have become smaller, now food in dhabas and restaurants has also become a big thing
 hamane jab dhabe or restaraan main jaakar dekha to paaya ki vahaan bhi veg or non veg thaliyaan yaa to gaayab ho gai hai yaa choti kar di gai hai

 For the common man, eating in dhabas and restaurants is proving to be far-fetched

 Residents of Rura town in Kanpur countryside are being given all such information not from any radio announcer or TV news anchor, but through an information center set up by a local villager named Raj Narayan Mishra for the last two decades
 rura sthit durga mandir main sthapit is anokhe soochna centre kii kaman raaj narayan ne akele hi sambhaal rakhi he, jo pichley 25 saal se jansamanya se judi jaankariyon kii ghoshnaa karte aa rahe hai

 'he said,' The information i give is not unique, but in a run-of-the-mill life, people consider it impractical to get these information personally

 For many people, my morning announcements work like a chicken bang, while many decide their routine according to my announcements
 ’narayan ke mutabik anpadh or kam padhe likhe log jo samachar madhyamon se nahin jude rahete, unke liye ye suchanaaen bahut ahm hoti hai
 Narayan's announcements go to the villages around the town, for this he has installed eight big loudspeakers
 inamen se chaar mandir or chaar vibhinn sthanon par lage hai
 Gopal Yadav, a hawker of clothes in the villages, says, 'narayan Chacha's announcements get a lot of benefit

 That old statement by Samuel Johnson is suddenly again on everyone's tongue that "patriotism is the last oat of a wicked man
" '' haalanki, vajah use todgaye-marodgaye kii shaatiranaa yaa baudmapane kii koshishen hai
 Some had dr
 johnson ke kahe main 'deshbhakti' kii jagah 'udaarvaad' rakh diya
 But what he said in front of his biographer James Boswell, there is not much scope for dilemma
 lekin unka aashay kya tha, is par halkaa sanshay shaayad ho saktaa he
 Apparently it may have an echo of local politics
 kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki bhalmaanush doctor kaa gussa un america upniveshvaadiyon kii 'deshbhakti' ke paakhand par utraa hoga, jo england se aazaadee kii jang chede hue the or apane swadhinata ke ghoshnaptr main jivan, swatantraaa or baaki tamaam badi baton kaa zikr kar rahe the lekin un goron ko gulam rakhane ke apane taur-tareekon main isse koi virodhabhas najar nahin aa rahaa tha
 Although Dr
 johnson kaa abhipraay chaahe jo ho, hamaare vartmaan uddeshyon ke liye unke shabd aparyaapt hai
 Patriotism is by far the most benign idea, so we need to pay attention to nationalism — because nationalism — according to Johnson's logic — can be the first gimmick of the young
 hungary main victor orban se lekar israel main netanyahu tak, turki main rajab taiyab erdogn se lekar italy main mateo salvini tak or trump se lekar hamaare apane desh main paley-bade swa-ghoshit 'rashtravaadiyon' tak—puri duniya main jahiraa taur par rashtrawaad kaa bolbalaa he
 And when the 'anti-national' 'urban naxalites' are not busy destroying the country and tearing down the established system, they cannot do anything more than that they can tolerate the situation
 haalanki meraa is tarah ke bhadakaau maamalon main padane kaa koi iraadaa nahin he, isliye main khud ko in shabdon—nesanalism (rashtrawaad) or patriatism (deshbhakti)—kii vishistataa or unke bich fark ko dhundne tak simit rakhuunga
 Patriotism is an old idea
 isaki utpatti 'patria' yaa pithrubhumi se hui he (kshamaa karen, bahano, 'metriotism' (rashtrawaad yaa deshbhakti kaa ulat) ko us nazariye se nahin dekha gaya, he na?) haalanki yahaan mahatvapurn baat yah he ki deshbhakti ko aamtaur par kisi vyakti ke uske desh ke prati pyaar, deshavaasiyon ke prati pyaar aadi ko samajha jaataa he
 This 'country' is definitely not a 'nation'
 is bhaavana kii shandaar abhivyakti wiliam butler yeats kii kavita 'ain irish airman forseej hij deth' main he
 In this poem by Yeats, local has been given more importance than national
 yah hamen 'deshbhakti' kii ek or visheshta par tippanee karne main sakasham banaata he—kyonki yah us cheez kaa pyaar he jiske liye koi marane tak ko taiyaar he—jaisaa ki jaisaa roman kavi horess ke prasiddh kathan main he, jise wilfred oven ne apni kavita 'world waar van' main likhaa he—''dulche at decorum ast, pro patria mori
 Owen's poem describes the agony of a soldier dying from suffocation due to a mustard gas attack, which concludes with Horace's statement: It is pleasant and appropriate to sacrifice life for our country
 'deshbhakti' ke uksaave main pyaar vaali rugnataa - 'registan kii ret laal ho gai he, or maine tumhaare england, mere apane england ke liye kya kiya he''—kii jagah alag bhavanaaen aa jaati hai jab ham 'rashtrawaad' ke kshetra manh pravesh karte hai
 Here, nationalism, rather than a love for particular things reflecting patriotism, is a sense of pride for the somewhat abstract notion ‘nation’
 or 'mar janaa' to deshbhakti ko aavaran detaa he, lekin samaan rup se mahatvapurn he ki rashtrawaad aisi shay he jiske liye vyakti kisi ko maarane ke liye taiyaar rahata he, or shaayad iske liye maarna jaruri hota he
 Therefore, patriotism is, essentially, defensive, conservative; Nationalism is aggressive by nature
 yahaan main jo kehane kii koshish kar rahaa hum use hindi shabdon kaa ek samooh badi khubsuurati ke saath vyakt karata he
 Thus, in Nationalism, our best word for 'nation' is nation and, for me, the difficult, coordinated consonant — the nation — tells me all that i see here in a game of emotion
 vah shabd jisamen country kii bhaavana jhalkati he vah 'desh' he—lekin antim 'sha' abhi bhi bahut dur kii aawaaj lagata he—or yah deshaj 'des' he jo deshbhakti kii aavashyak antarangta ke saath judata hua lagata he
 If 'des' is 'desh' in Kishori Amonkar's 'avo Mharo Des', its juice will be gone
 or ek sundar raag he jise main des kahata hum—haalanki maine ise desh kehete hue bhi suna he
 i look forward to fearing what the raga nation will sound like — it will surely sound like a drone
 bahut saare logon kii aawaaj, naare lagaate hue
 And various voices — the sound of bones being broken, flesh stuck in bars
 
 
 sari romaaniat kafoor ho jaaegi
 Usually, in such a context, people impose the 'idea of india' —which is variously firm, endangered, admired, condemned
 haalanki main iske shabdic antar ko samajhate hue yah tajavij karata hum ki ham 'bharat kii bhaavana' se kaam karen
 i hope that soon we will see local traits giving patriotism its distinct emotional tone
 is prakaar, main jis 'bharat' ke prati anuraag anubhav karata hum, vah hindipattee main mere thikaane kii visheshta se atoot rup judaa he—jo vibhinn soch, vibhinn manyataon, vibhinn samskruti vaale anginat logon se milakar banataa gaya—kafile basate gaye, hindostaan banataa gaya
 There is an affection for humanity which naturally gathers on the banks of the river every winter
 lekin vahaan garmi main lu bhi chalati he, jisase bachane ke liye log sarkande kii chik ke peeche jamaa hote hai
 These chickens are associated with romantic moments of extremely conservative societies
 aam ke baag (amarai) main niztaa kii duvidha bhi he—or purvi ang ke sangeet main komal shringarik aakarshan he—sawan kii rimjhim, jhule: barasan laagi kaari badariyaa / bagiya main jhule pade
 Of course, the gardens are now just memories, but it is this 'india' that expresses patriotism
 lekin mujhe lagata he ki desh ke alag-alag hisson ke logon kii deshbhakti kii bhaavnaatmak or drishy saamagree apane aap main adwitiya hogi
 And that's fine
 duusari ore, rashtrawaad apane swabhaav ke anuroop is vividhta ko samyojit nahin kar saktaa—or ise kisi prakaar kii vijayi vilakshantaa—''nayaa bharat''—main sametane kaa prayaas bina hinsa ke ho nahin saktaa
 i can hear the sound of Rashtra Raga starting — its sound like the beat of shoes entering the valley — but in the meantime, the image of the angry Hanuman emerging on the windows of millions of cars gives me a sense of the future
 main jis 'bharat' ke prati anuraag anubhav karata hum, vah vividhta se atoot rup se judaa he—vibhinn soch, vibhinn manyataon, vibhinn samskruti vaale anginat logon se milakar banataa gaya—kafile basate gaye, hindostaan banataa gaya
 The image of Bharat Mata has developed very interestingly, it has become the image of a flagged warrior woman who emerged from the imagination of Hindutva from the gentle woman of Avinindranath Tagore's painting
 mujhe andeshaa he ki ''india'', jo ab bharat nahin rahaa, kii jo chhavi hamaare chaaron ore garaj rahi he—hawa main laharaate, gusse se bhare mukke—vah ''nari'' kii kisi bhi kalpana main samahit nahin ho sakati
 May i say with all humility that our culture presents a possible solution in the image of Ardhanarishwar, who is exclusively Indian? Alok Rai was a professor of English at Delhi University

 Due to the Prime Minister's program, full vigilance is being exercised
 pichley dinon surat main bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke kaarykram main jis tarah virodh pradarshan hua tha, use dekhte hue police or prashasan koi jokhim nahin lenaa chaahate
 Three records will be made in the Prime Minister's program: BJP MP from New Delhi, CR Patil claims that three world records will be broken in the program for the differently-abled
 patil kaa kahana he ki abhi tak divyagon ko kit baantne kaa jo record he wo bhipradhanmantri modike hi varanasi kaarykram main bana tha
 According to Patil, kits will be distributed to 11,200 Divyang in Navsari
 bijepi saansad kaa kahana he ki isi kaarykram main doosraa record wheel chair baantne kaa banegaa
 Caricordatha sharing the highest 376 wheelchairs in any event so far

 According to Patil, the third record will be made of 2200 hearing aid sharing
 abhi tak ye record 500 hearing aid baantne kaa he
 Approximately Rs 8 crore equipment will be distributed to the Divyang in Navsari program
 patil ne ye bhi kaha ki navsari kii saamaajik sansthaaon kii ore se pradhanmantri modi ke 67wein janmdin par 67lakh rupye kaa check diya jayega
 This will create a skill development center for the differently abled, so that they can become self-sufficient by training there
 police-prashasan puri tarah chaukasapatil ne bharosa jataayaa ki is kaarykram main do lakh se zyada log jutenge
 When asked about the protests at Amit Shah's event in Surat, Patil said that 150-200 people were sent by AAP and Congress to disrupt the event
 patil ne kaha ki pradhanmantri 17 sitambar ko jis kaarykram main aa rahe hai, wo divyangon se judaa he, vahaan aise virodh pradarshan kii koi sambhaavna nahin
 According to Patil, even if any such attempt is made, the responsibility of law and order is with the police and administration
 vahiin, navsari kaa prashasan bhi din-raat pradhanmantri ke kaarykram kii taiyaariyon ke liye juta he
 Navsari District Magistrate Ravi Kumar Arora has expressed confidence that the Prime Minister's program will be fully successful
 purv pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri kii maut par aksar sawaal uthte rahe hai
 His family himself has been anticipating the conspiracy behind Shastriji's death
 aksar soshal media par aisi post viral hoti hai, jisamen daawa kiya jaataa he ki laal bahadur shastri ko jehar diya gaya tha
 It is sometimes claimed that the US CIA was responsible for his death
 haalanki laal bahadur shastri kii rahasyamay maut se to pardaa nahin uth sakaa, lekin varisht patrkaar or blogar vishnu sharma ne apni haalia kitaab main shastri ji kii maut ke peeche siie conection par jarur charchaa kii he
 Vishnu Sharma, in his book titled 'history of 50 Viral Sachs' from Prabhat Publication, writes that in the 90s, when the book of an American journalist named Gregory Douglas came out, there was a ruckus in America as well as in India
 jo lajimi bhi tha
 Actually, the book was written after a conversation with a CIA spy who specialized in intelligence operations
 us jasoos kaa naam tha robert trumbul croule
 In the book, quoting Crowley, there is a hint of CIA being behind the death of Lal Bahadur Shastri
 vishnu sharma ne apni kitaab main america patrkaar dwaara siie agent robert trumbul croule se puche gaye un do sawaalon or unke jawaab ko bhi jyon kaa tyon rakhaa he
 Lal Bahadur Shastri is mentioned in Crowley's reply
 shastri ji kii maut ke alaava is kitaab main aisi tamaam ghatnaon kii vistaar se padtaal kii gai he, jiskaa aksar hamase paala padataa rahata he or ek nishchit antaraal ke baad soshal media se lekar watsape ke inbox main 'viral massej' ke rup main dikh hi jaati hai
 For example, the relationship between Jawaharlal Nehru and Ghiyasuddin Ghazi, Bhagat Singh's hanging from Valentine's Day or the secret of Jinnah, which could have prevented the partition
 'phek news' ke is daur main yah kitaab ek jaruri hastkshep kii tarah he

 However, the revenue records were forged and this land worth several hundred crores was later illegally seized as Johar Ali University
 'adhikari ke anusaar, nadi ke kinaaron par kabja karne ke liye va dhokhadhadi karne ke uddeshy se banaae gaye jaali dastavej, ajam khan ke khilaaf majboot saboot ke taur par uplabdh hai

 com / ej0cz80tm2gauratlab he ki yah koi pehla mauka nahin jab sadhvi pragna ne vivaadit bayaan diya ho
 Earlier Sadhvi Pragya said that she was proud of the demolition of Babri Masjid
 pragna thakur ne ek tivi channel se kaha tha ki babari masjid kaa dhaancha giraane kaa afsos nahin he, dhaancha giraane par to ham garv karte hai
 There were waste materials on our Lord Ramji's temple, we removed them
 " maalegaanv blast main aaropee pragna thakur ne aage kaha tha ki ham garv karte hai, is par hamaara swabhimaan jaagaa he, prabhu ram ji kaa bhavy mandir bhi banaaenge
 By breaking the structure, he had awakened the pride of Hindus
 vahaan bhavy mandir banaakar bhagwaan kii aradhana karenge, anand paaenge
 "explain that BJP had nominated Pragya Thakur from Bhopal
 pragna ne isse pehle mumbai ke aties pramukh rahe or aatankwaadiyon kii goli se shahid hue hemanth karkare par vivaadit bayaan diya tha
 He also apologized while withdrawing the statement when the matter caught hold
 darasal, sadhvi pragna ne shanivaar ko bhopal main campan ke dauraan ek tivi channel par babari masjid ko lekar yah tippanee kii or isaki vajah se ek baar phir babari masjid vidhwans kii ghatana raajnneetik galiyaaron main taaja ho gai
 Sadhvi Pragya told TV channel, 'ram temple will definitely be built
 yah ek bhavy mandir hoga
 When asked if she can give a timeline for building the Ram temple, Pragya said that we will build the temple
 aakhirkaar, ham dhaancha (babari masjid) ko dhwast karne ke liye bhi to gaye the
 Sadhvi Pragya also highlighted her important role in Babri Masjid and said that i had broken on the structure
 mujhe garv he ki ishwar ne mujhe avasar diya or shakti di or maine yah kaam kar diya
 Now we will build Ram temple there
 sadhvi ke is bayaan ke chand ghanton ke andar hi chunaav ayog ne unhen notice thama diya tha
 Before the notice was given, an advisory was also issued to all political parties, stating that the number of complaints being received against each other are clearly indicating that the leaders are making provocative and controversial statements
 Giving, which can spread hatred and incompatibility in society
 isse pehle bhopal loksabhaa seat se bijepi kii ummidavaar sadhvi pragna thakur ne haal hi main 26 / 11 mumbai hamale ke zikr ke dauraan mumbai ke tatkaaleen aties chif hemanth karkare par aapattijanak tippanee kii thi
 In a conversation with the media, he had told that he had told Karkare that you will have an apocalypse
 iske baad pragna kii tippanee par khub vivaad hua
 Later he also had to withdraw his statements
 es jaishankar ko sidhe kendriya mantri kaa pad mila he, ye apane aap main pehla mauka he lekin 10 saal pehle is tarah cabinet main jagah paane vaale shaks nandan nilekani ho sakate the
 He was called by Rahul Gandhi to give the post of Minister of Human Resource Development
 haalanki bilkul aakhri samay main sonia gandhi or tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke punarvichaar ke baad is prastaav ko waapas le liya gaya jabaki nilekani dilli ke liye udaan bharne ko bilkul taiyaar the
 Read the excerpt from the book below
 
 
 hamaari unase bengalooru main ek conference room main mulaakaat hoti he
 At that time it seemed as if the brilliant weather of Bengaluru has brought an end to the heat and the outbreak of the base dispute
 nandan par aadhaar virdohi kaaryakartaaon dwaara banaae gaye servilans frenkstin banane kaa aarope tha
 The Supreme Court ruled decisively in this case and today Nandan has the great satisfaction of completing his mission, which started under a government and was completed in a government which is ideologically opposite from the previous government
 ye puraa safar ek phone kol se shuru hua
 Nandan says, in 2009, i got a call from Rahul Gandhi
 unhone mujhe nateezon vaale din phone kiya tha, jab congress ne or zyada siton ke saath vaapasi kii thi
 It was an unexpected second victory for the UPA government, with the Congress alone securing 206 seats
 unhone mujhase poocha ki kya main bharat kaa maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri banane kaa icchhuk hum?' hamen koi aisa chahie jo baahar se ho
 i talked to my colleagues and they all replied, "okay man
" '' phir maine unase kah diya ki ve taiyaar hai
 i was in Bengaluru on the day of the swearing in of the new cabinet
 ab mujhe in fundon ke bare main nahin pataa tha ki raajnneeti ke liye aapako dilli main date rahanaa padegaa or apane naam ke elaan hone kii pratiksha kerani hogi
 At 11 am i received a call to ask if i am in Delhi
 main tehra ek iti vaala banda
 i said no
 ' main bengalooru main tha
 He asked if i could come till 5 pm to take oath, then i told him that i did not have a private jet
 iske baad main dilli jane liye koi vimaan dekhne laga
 The funny thing is that s
 em
 Krishna, who was elected to the post of foreign minister, was heading to Delhi
 vah bhi bengalooru main the lekin unka ghar hawaii adde se bahut paas tha, isliye ve pahunchane main kaamyaab rahe
 And in the meantime was trying to arrange airplanes
 nandan ne bataate hai, 'rahul gandhi ne phir phone kiya or kaha maaf kiijie, aapako shaamil nahin kiya ja rahaa he' baad main mujhe laga ki shaayad sonia gandhi ko laga hoga ki main corporate vaala aadmi or hum or garibon kii samasyaon ko nahin samajhuunga
 At the same time, Manmohan Singh must have felt that i am a technocrat, not a politician
 lihaaja echaradi mantralay sanbhaalanaa mere liye kaaphi rajnatik ho jayega
 It was a major task - they did not want to give it to a modest man from Bangalore
 ' nandan hans pade
 'this was Rahul's idea, but it was turned down
 main apane puraane kaam par laut aayaa
 In the book, Nandan Nilekani also explained how the Aadhaar scheme developed and how he had to explain it to people across the country, including Narendra Modi
 nandan tab ke mukhya vipakshi netaaon bhaajapa ke arun jetali or sushamaa swaraj se mulaakaat ko yaad karte hai or kehete hai ki unki sabase badi chunauti gujarat ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri narendra modi the, jo sanyog kahen yaa bhagya, wo ek din ke aadhaar kaa sabase bada pairokaar ban gaye
 Nandan recalls, 'even though everything was ready in Gujarat, Chief Minister Modi did not approve the rollout
 tab mujhe unase milane kaa sandesh mila or isliye main gujarat gaya
 "I thought," i want to make this project a success, i can meet anyone
 unhone kaha, ''baithak aadhe ghante ke liye nirdhaarit thi jo dedh ghante chali, or phir mukhyamantri ne nandan nilekani ke saath tasviren leen, jise unhone baad main share bhi gaya
 'I think they wanted to show people that i went to meet them
 isliye, main unke saath vahaan baitha or unhone mujhe apane jivan ke safar main 2002 dangon par unke uthaae kadam, chaay vaale ke rup main apni shuruyaat tak, sab kuch bataaya
 He approved the project as soon as i left
 'maine poocha, 'kya aapako kabhi niraashaa hui ki aap ek raajnneetik khel ke bich main funs gaye?' yah khel he
 Reforms in India do not occur in linear fashion
 yah do kadam aage-ek-kadam peeche lene vaali prakriya he
 It is a period of time of high activity and complete inactivity, but the same is true
 yahi raajnneeti kii prakruti he
 When there is high activity time, you do as much as possible
 vahiin jab yah niskriyata main jaataa he, to aap apana samay bitaate hai
 Must be something
 mantri yaa naukarshah badal jaaenge
 If you are playing a long game, you can deal with these types of things
 ' UIDAI yojana ko raajnneeti se dur rakhane ke liye, nandan or unki team ne ek aisa naam bhi chunaa jo gaiyr-raajnneetik tha
 'I did not want such a XYZ plan, so we did a lot of research carefully and found "aadhaar", which means foundation; Your identity is the foundation
 'isse bhi mahatvapurn baat, 'aadhaar' shabd lagbhag sabhi bhartiya bhashaaon main kaam karata he
 But in an effort to avoid politicization, Nandan explains how each of its characters became political
 'yojana kaa naaraa he "aam aadmi kaa adhikaar
 "congress used to use this slogan often before Aam Aadmi Party exaggerated 'aam Aadmi'
 keval do logon ne is par dhyaan diya- sonia gandhi or narendra modi
 When i met Modi ji, he said, "why have you used the slogan of Congress?" Then one day, Mrs Gandhi told me that she believed that i was using BJP colors on the basis that people were being sent
 is par maine kaha ki yah tirange ke rang hai
 i had to take samples to show them that they were indeed the colors of the national flag
 ab yahaan ek arab logon ke liye ek card ja rahaa tha, to jaahir he ki ek vyakti iske likhaawat, pratikon or rangon ke bare main chintit hoga
 He says, yet what was surprising to me in the whole system was that only Sonia Gandhi and Modi ji asked about it! ”
 
 
 
 
 
 And then came a turning point for Nandan Nilekani and Aadhaar
 2014 kaa chunaav or apni gharelu seat, bangalore dakshin se ek saansad kaa chunaav ladane kaa unka faisla
 He lost the election to the late Ananth Kumar of BJP
 nandan kii chunavi haar sambhavat: kisi cheez main unki pehali asafalataa thi
 He recounted this experience with impunity
 yahaan tak ki isamen aadhaar kii bhi bhoomika thi
 In the 2014 elections, the BJP brought me to the fore as 'aadhaar Man' - even Modi ji came and campaigned against me and Aadhaar
 khayr yahi raajnneeti he
 Apart from the individual defeat, the UPA defeat was more worrying for Nandan and his vision for Aadhaar
 vah yaad karte hai, 'main ghabara gaya kyonki aadhaar kaa koi or pairokaar nahin tha
 The bjp's official position in the opposition was to end it
 grih mantralay, jisase main ab tak dur hi rahaa tha, ne achaanak avasar dekha or dakhal dena shuru kar diya
 Finally, i met the Prime Minister and discussed the basis and benefits of the country
 tab unhone mujhase vahi saamaanya se sawaal puche, jinamein se ek yah tha ki agar bangladeshiyon ko ye mil gaye to? maine unhen bataaya ki yah koi naagarikta number nahin he balki pahchaan (idi) number he
 i told them that this will help in bringing the benefits of government schemes directly to the beneficiaries, which will save the government a lot and also reduce corruption
 us vakt, saubhaahgya se tel kii keemten bhi bahut zyada thim
 Therefore, the government was focusing on savings
 ant main wo aadhaar ke sabase bade pairokaar ban gaye
 The Prime Minister's support to Aadhaar and almost taking it over has led to different problems
 congress ne jaldbaaji main ise band kar diya
 After the journey that started with a phone call from Rahul Gandhi, the person making the call was now Nandan himself
 'maine unhen is project ko apnaane kaa aagrah karne ke liye ek sandesh bheja kyonki yah shaayad upie-2 kii sabase badi uplabdhi thi
 But they did not do so
 ve saaf taur par kehete hai ki unhen lagata he ki congress ne ye mauka barbaad kar diya

 At the same time, Romney addressed supporters in Virginia and said that Obama has no agenda for a second term
 yadi obama dobaaraa nirvaachit hote hai to america madhyamvargeey pariwaron ko salanaa 4,000 dollar adhik kar chukaana hoga
 The comments obama or romany ke bich mangalvaar ko hui bahes ke turant baad karwaae gaye surveykshan main haalanki logon ne obama kaa paksh liya, lekin samikshakon kaa kahana he ki isse white house ke liye daud kii tasviir saaf nahin hone ja rahi

 Obama, while addressing a rally in Iowa on Wednesday, said Romney's five-point program to strengthen the economy was in fact a one-point plan that would benefit only the rich
 vahiin, romany ne varjeenia main samarthakon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki obama ke paas duusare kaarykaal ke liye koi agenda hi nahin he
 If Obama is re-elected, American middle-class families will pay $ 4,000 more tax annually

 Mumbai have made their mark on the bowling performance of the bowlers on the very first day of the Ranji Trophy final match with Saurashtra at the domestic Wankhede Stadium
 75 saal main pehali baar final main pahunche saurashtra kii pehali pari 148 ranon par sametane ke baad mumbai ne din kii samaapti tak apni pehali pari main bina koi wicket ganvaae 19 ran bana liye
 Openers Wasim Jaffer returned 11 and Kaustubh Pawar unbeaten on four runs
 jafar ko ranjai itihaas main sabase adhik ran banane vaala khilaadi banane ke liye ab 72 ranon kii jarurat he
 Mumbai has plenty of batting opportunities as well as a golden chance to win the title for the 40th time
 iske liye use bas apni pehali pari main 148 ranon kaa yoga paar karnaa hoga or phir apane score ko us oonchai tak le janaa hoga, jahaan se saurashtra ke ballebaaj use paar paane kii himmat na kar saken
 This opportunity is with Mumbai and it is not difficult for him to do it given the current form

 For now, it can be assumed that the BJP-PDP coalition government is going to be formed in Jammu Kashmir
 lekin donon ke bichkaaman minimum programko lekar gatirodh bana hua he
 This is a historic occasion for Jammu and Kashmir when two opposite poles political parties are working together to form a government
 disambar main vidhansabha kii 87 siton ke liye hue chunaav mempidipi ko 28jabakibijapi ko 25siten mili thim

 Elections are going to be held on March 2 for 11 seats of the State Legislative Council
 mana ja rahaa he ki is chunaav tak sarkaar kaa gathan tal bhi saktaa he
 Meanwhile, pdp's chief spokesperson Naeem Akhtar has made it clear that there is no such thing as a timeframe to form a PDP-BJP government in the state
 sarkaar banane main donon partiyon ke bich jin muddon par takaraav he unamem ye paanch pench fanse hue hai -1
 Article 370 is the biggest issue of confrontation between the two parties in Jammu and Kashmir
 pidipi chaahati he ki bijepi use likhit aashwaasan de ki wo dhara 370 kaa mudda nahin uthaaegi
 The BJP is not in favor of giving written assurance
 2

 bijepi kaa stand he ki isamen sena kii raay lee jaani chahie or chunki ye centre kaa visheshadhikaar he isliye ye maamla centre sarkaar par hi choda janaa chahie

 Similarly, BJP Nirmal Singh of BJP will take over the chair of Deputy Chief Minister, this too is almost certain
 pidipi chaahati he ki said puure chah saal mukhyamantri bane rahen, jabaki bijepi chaahati he ki donon partiyon ko teen-teen saal ke liye mukhyamantri pad mili

 kashmir mudde par pakistan or hurriyat ke saath baatcheet ko lekar bhi bijepi or pidipi ke stand paraspar virdohi rahe hai, lekin pradhanmantri narendra modi or pakistani pradhanmantri navaj sharif ke bich baatcheet ke baad donon paksh is maamle main narmi barat rahe hai
 5
 pakistan se aae sharnaarthiyon ko lekar yathasthiti banaae rakhane or parisemen ayog ko lekar bhi donon ke siyaasi hit takaraa rahe hai
 There is an attempt to get a way out of this conversation

" lekin, bharat koshish kar saktaa he ki pakistan ko vishwa cap khilne se roka jaae
 Gavaskar said, "I know that even after not playing a match with Pakistan, India is so strong that it can qualify for the next round

 The central government is bringing a direct benefit scheme to alleviate poverty from the country
 is yojana ke tahat sarkaar desh ke gramin ilaakon main garibi jhel rahe lagbhag 8
 Will give loans to 5 crore families
 yah karj in garib pariwaron ko vyavsaay kaa nayaa jariya taiyaar karne ke liye diya jayega
 This loan is special because the central government will pay a large part of the interest on this loan
 kise milegaa 1 lakh rupaya1 lakh rupee kaa londene ke liye kendra sarkaar ne haal main karaae gaye saamaajik, aarthik or jati surveykshan ke aankadon kaa sahaara liya he
 About 8 such central government figures in these figures
 5 karod pariwaron ko chinhit karegi or is yojana ke tahat 2019 tak ek lakh rupee kaa lone aavantit karegi
 Why will the loan be given? Under the scheme of loan of Rs
 1 lakh, the Central Government is trying to strengthen the governmental framework of Rural Financing
 is yojana kaa lakshya gramin ilaakon main garib pariwaron kii kshetreey sahuukaar or microfinanos companiyon par nirbharta kam karne kii he
 It is worth noting that while the interest charged by banks is around 11 per cent for loans, regional moneylender and microfinance companies charge much more than this rate and poor families in rural areas are burdened with this interest
 kis kaam ke liye milegaa lonkendra sarkaar ke gramin vikaas mantralay ne krishi or animal hasbendary mantralay ke saath qaraar kiya he
 Under this agreement, poor families will be enabled to earn income through activities such as plowing, poultry farms and goat rearing

 Apart from this, with the help of the National Dairy Board, the government is also working on the participation of private companies in this sector
 4 se 7 fisadi byaaj degi sarkarbank dwaara lone ke liye liye ja rahe 11 fisadi byaaj dar ko kam karne ke liye gramin vikaas mantralay 4 fisadi byaaj interest sabavarjan ke jariye kam kar 7 fisadi par uplabdh karaayega
 At the same time, in about 250 very backward districts of the country, the central government is preparing to give this loan at 4% interest only
 iske liye vah un pariwaron ko interest sabavarjan ke jariye hi 3 fisadi atirikt chhot degi jo samay se apane byaaj kii bharpai karegaa
 Shekhar Kapur's film The Bandit Queen, which was first released in India in 1994, generally did not receive a good media response
 khaskar eksex sinaki aalochana kii gai jisamen phulan devi apane premi vikram mallaah ke upar hoti he
 Critic and filmmaker Pankaj Butalia said that this scene does not hug because it does not look like a 'rustic' woman would love this way
 da bandit queen ko lekar shuru hue vivaad se kaamuktha ko lekar bahes jari rahi, par is maamle main charchaa ke centre main shahari madhyavargeey aurat aa gai or iskaa phayda use hi mila
 This common belief has persisted, the women of Kimhanagar are far ahead in sex-related activities, while the conservative type woman of small towns are shy or shy to take initiative in sex-related activities
 india today-nilsan sex survey ne bhartiya auraton, khaskar chote shaharon kii auraton kii mardon ke saath yon sambandh banane kii ichchhaaon or chalan ke adhyayan main yogadan kiya he
 In the process, it has not only demolished the stereotypical image of Indian women created in the last century by colonial perceptions and policies, but also the nationalist narrative and scholarship of gender knowledge created in the post-colonial era
 chote shaharon kii auraten ab is baat kii kalpana karke dukhi nahin hoti hai ki pashchim kii auraten sex ke maamle main kitni aaazaad hai
 The survey shows that now he himself has broken his hesitation and participated in the same race of sex
 bharat main shaadi se pehle ke sambandhon ke bare main bahut pataa nahin chal paata sivaay iske ki iske bare main logon kii tyoriyaan chadhi rahati hai
 But the results of this survey suggest that relationships are formed despite strict monitoring of the sexuality of young women and some of these percentages result in sex
 udhaaharan ke liye chote shaharon kii sabhi auraton main se 21 fisadi kabhi-na-kabhi kisi mard ke saath date par gai hai
 However, the metros figure for women is 38 per cent
 avivaahit auraton main mahanagaron or chote shaharon ke aankadon kaa yah antar kaaphi kam ho jaataa he
 22% of unmarried women in small cities surveyed have gone on a date with men, while in metropolitan cities the figure for such women is 30%
 haa, antarangta kaa str jaise-jaise badhata he, yah khai or kam hoti jaati he
 Seeing the figure of unmarried women kissing a man and tasting a kiss for the first time between the ages of 16 and 18, women from small towns are not far behind the women of the metropolis in pursuing romance with men
 vastav main auraton ke dating par jane kii umr kii baat karen to chote shaharon kii auraten is maamle main mahanagaron kii auraton se aage dikhti hai: date par jane vaali chote shaharon kii auraton ke 30 fisadi ne pehali baar 16 se 18 varsh kii umr main aisa kiya tha jabaki isi aayu varg kii mahanagaron kii sirf 19 fisadi auraten date par gai thim
 But comparing the figures of both married and unmarried women, this picture changes: the number of unmarried women going to dating for the first time at that age has been 31 per cent in both metros and small towns
 lekin chote shaharon main 16 se 18 varsh kii umr main pehali baar date par jane kii baat sweekaar karne vaali vivaahit mahilaon kaa pratishat kareeb 33 fisadi he jabaki mahanagaron main yah sirf 13 fisadi he
 What is the reason for this huge difference? One might surmise that women from small towns get married sooner, but their desire to show that they too have gone on dating is actually linked to showing themselves modern, so they go out with their husbands She also calls "dating"
 shaadi se pehle rishton ko mahanagar or chote shaharon main har jagah dekha ja saktaa he
 The matrimonial structure of a husband and wife is still considered an accepted form of sexual activity
 survey main shaamil 80 fisadi auraton ne kaha ki unke pehle sex partner unke pati hi the; 82 fisadi ne apane jivan main sirf ek vyakti ke saath yon sambandh banaae the or 90 fisadi kaa kabhi bhi koi vivahetar sambandh nahin rahaa
 a large number of women expect equal partnerships with their husbands in the matter of sex and they are getting it as well, with a majority of 60 per cent of women claiming that they also have equal interference in the matter of sex lives
 haalanki shaadi ke daayre ke baahar sexuality kii abhivyakti bahut kam he, lekin bharat ke chote shaharon main danpatiyon ke bedroom ab ubaau jagah nahin rah gaye hai
 This survey is remarkable in terms of showing a clear picture about sex related to the life and mind of women of small towns
 66 fisadi auraten maanati hai ki unke rishte main sex kii mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 23 per cent admit to having sexual fantasies and 30 per cent have seen porn films occasionally
 porn filmein dekhne vaali auraton main lagbhag aadhi aisi hai jo har do maheene par aisi filmein dekh leti hai
 Although most women have not shown much interest in experimenting with positions during sexual intercourse, at least 10 percent believe that they prefer to stay up during sex
 sanyog se, mahanagaron kii auraton ke maamle main yah aankada samaan he
 The figure of this active interest in sex and sexuality sits at par with the number of women unwilling to talk about sex
 survey main shaamil 76 fisadi auraten apane parivaar ke saath yon maamalon par charchaa nahin karatin or akele yaa pati-patni ke saath sex therepist kii salaah lene ke liye taiyaar logon kaa aankada bhi koi khaas bada nahin he
 Friends and TV have emerged as the biggest sources of information about sex
 sex ke bare main khulkar charchaa karne kii is hichak kii vajah se hi yah hairat kii baat nahin he ki survey main shaamil chote shaharon kii auraton ke 34 fisadi ne mana he ki sex ajukeshan ke maamle main porn kii kuch bhoomika ho sakati he
 Sex and homosexuality with relatives are still the biggest taboo for small towns
 sage rishtedaaron ke vyabhichaar kii khabaren samay-samay par aati rahati hai-is maamle main pinki viraani kii bitor chocolate kaa hawala diya ja saktaa he-phir bhi survey main ‘ghar ko swarg’ maanane kii lokapriy dharna ko chunauti bahut kam mil pai he
 Homosexuality is another 'forbidden' area
 survey main shaamil 17 fisadi auraton kaa kahana he ki ve parivaar ko saath banaae rakhane ke liye vivahetar sambandh ke liye pati ko maaf kar dengi
 Of these, 63 per cent agree to forgive husbands for extramarital affairs with women, but only 14 per cent of women are willing to forgive husbands for homosexual relationships
 80 fisadi auraton kii bisexuality (aurat or purush donon ke saath sex sambandh) ko kisi bhi tarah se sweekaar karne ko taiyaar nahin hai or 79 fisadi ne samalangikta ko bhi khaarij kiya he
 However, in the case of women in metros, this figure is 67 and 64 percent respectively
 survey main apni sexuality se jude ravaie or aadat ke bare main aam taur par baat karte samay mard aankadon ko badha-chadhaakar bataate hai taaki yah dikhaa saken ki auraten unke prati kis had tak aakarshith rahati hai
 Many times the percentage of males in terms of going on dating may mean that they have more chances of sex relations than women
 lekin survey main aae aankadon se yah majboot sanket miltaa he ki mard or auraten yaa to apane anubhavon ko badha-chadhaakar yaa kam karke bataati hai or ye kamobesh donon ke liye samaan hi hai
 In this way, the figures of dating of men and women of small towns repeatedly look similar in many respects
 yahaan tak ki is sawaal ke bare main ki aapane sabase pehle kiske saath yon sambandh kaayam kiye the, chote shaharon main mardon or auraton kaa aankada ekadam samaan he
 The survey proves that the clarity of sexual expression of women collides with the image made about Indian women in which they are described as either sati-savitri and virtuous or sex-starved
 is survey se saamne ai chote shaharon kii auraton kii chhavi ek atyant jatil tasviir pesh karti he jo is tarah ke sarleekaran ke khilaaf jaati he
 If an easy conclusion is drawn in view of all the figures, then the details of those figures immediately challenge it
 surveykshan ek or vajah se bhi mahatvapurn he: pichley do dashak main bharat main sexuality ke adhyayan ko lagaataar sweekaaryata hasil hui he, lekin jaisaa ki soshal anthropologist manuela sioti bataati hai ki chote shaharon main logon ko prachlit hetrosexual (vipareet ling sex) tareekon ke bare main simit jaankaree he
 In this way, this survey opens the door to a whole new way of possible question-and-answer and surely it should be considered its main achievement
 kanya bhrun hatya par ko laker logon ke dil ko jhakzorne vaale aamir khan ke sho kaa pehla asar najar aa gaya he
 On this issue, Aamir met the Chief Minister of Rajasthan on Wednesday and on Thursday the Chief Justice of the High Court agreed to set up a fast track court

 Not only this, Ashok Gehlot on Friday morning 11 in this matter

 The most important alliance in the Bihar Assembly elections is the JDU-BJP alliance
 vartmaan main satta kii bagdor isi gathbandhan ke haath main he
 Although the leader of the alliance and the current Chief Minister Nitish Kumar seems confident about his victory, but he is also worried about the lalu-paswan alliance somewhere
 dekha jaae to donon hi partiyaan apni-apni suvidha ke liye hi ek saath hai
 Recently, after the uproar in Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi's posters in Patna, it seemed as if Nitisha would distance herself from the BJP
 lekin aisa nahin hua
 Both parties know that if they separate, both will have to face the loss
 ek ore jahaan nitish ke paas musalamaanon kaa samarthan he to duusari ore bijepi ke paas kattar hinduvadiyon or vyavsaayee varg kaa samarthan he
 In this way these two parties play the role of complement each other
 is gathbandhan main jahaan tak samjhaute kaa sawaal he to isamen bhaajapa hi zyaada samjhaute karti rahi he kyonki uske paas nitish jaisaa vot bank yaa kahen ki jatigat aadhaar nahin he
 Secondly, Nitish has a huge political personality and the BJP does not have any leader in Bihar who can match him
 haalanki nitish apni jeet kaa daawa to kar rahe hai lekin wo pakke taur par yah nahin kah sakate ki unka gathbandhan jitegaa hi
 Anyway, all the parties in the state have had to go from the leaders who changed the party to get tickets
 isliye yah sateek anumaan lagaana mushkil he ki oont kis karavat baithegaa
 This alliance can get a good challenge from the RJD-LJP alliance because in the by-elections in 18 seats in 2009, this alliance made Nitish think

 The NIA has sought details from RAW and IB about the operational capacity of Hizbut Tahriah, so that they can get this information from Bangladesh agencies
 sutron ke mutabik, hizbut taharir pichley teen saal se is ilaake main indian mujahidin ke saath kaam kar rahaa he
 Tahrir also has a significant presence in Bihar
 sutron ke mutabik, indian mujahidin kaa yah napak rishta 2010 se shuru hota he, jab iem ne apane darbhanga or pashchim bengal ke modul ko active kiya tha
 The people of Hizbut Tahrir are in the border area and take the people of Indian Mujahideen in and out of the border as needed
 sutron ke mutabik, aatankwaadiyon ne rohingya muslim ke khilaaf hinsa ko lekar ek massej dene ke liye ye dhamaake kiye hai
 a few days ago the IB was informed that Lashkar was training some people of Rohingya Muslims against Buddhists
 ye dhamaake jaldbaaji main kae gaye he

 lekin 2008 ke baad iem takneekee taur par unnat bamon kaa istemaal shuru kar diya tha
 On the basis of these bombs, agencies are suspected of carrying out the blasts of Buddhagaya on IM modules
 bam ke saath mili slip, jis par bam ko plant karne kii lokation likhi hui thi, is baat kii ore ishaara kar rahi he ki is maamle main main madul ne kisi local ke madul ko bam plant karne kaa kaam diya tha
 But the purpose of planting the bomb so early in the morning is to surprise the investigating agencies, because usually by this time the temple is not very crowded

 He was on a foreign tour for the first time after returning to India from South Africa

 Gandhi's name was established all over the world due to the use of non-cooperation movement
 ye wo daur bhi tha jab mashin, kalpurje or kaarkaane logon kii jagah lete ja rahe the
 Gandhi was deeply saddened that due to machines in Europe, people are becoming unemployed and the technology of this machine can make people unemployed in India
 haalanki mahatma gandhi or charlie chaplin kii mulaakaat ummiido ke mutabik nahin thi
 In fact, Gandhi did not like cinema and did not even have a specific idea about film stars
 unhone is meeting se pehle ye bhi poocha tha ki charlie chaplin koun he?gandhi or chaplin main is vishay par hui thi batahaalanki chaplin ko gandhi kii vichaardhaara ke bare main kuch andaja tha
 Chaplin asked him about the reason he disliked the machines
 is par gandhi ne kaha tha ki mashiinon ke chalate hamen england par ashrith hona padaa tha or isse baahar nikalne ke liye ek hi upaay he ki ham mashinari se bani chizon ko bycott karnaa shuru kar den
 Chaplin also did not completely agree with him and he believed that machines are also necessary for progress
 haalanki wo is baat se impress the ki gandhi apane desh kii freedom ko lekar kis had tak jute hue hai
