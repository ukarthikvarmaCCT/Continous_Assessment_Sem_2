 Some more perception, but when the figures are presenting the picture of such an economy that the people of the country are trying to get jobs and save the money by leaving a round of income and spending, India Today's opinion poll of the country shows that people The perceptions of it are flowing towards some other direction

 However, the debate of jobs in the country is complicated because while one type of data suggests a crisis, other figures show a boom in job creation

 32 pratishat kaa maananaa tha ki sarkaar ko kar chhot ke jariye nijee kshetra ko protsaahan dena chahie to 20 fisad ne start-ap ko badhaava dene kaa suzav diya

 Rumors spread from one place to another via phone

 Many educated people also came under the guise of such rumors
 yah 1970 ke dashak kii baat he
 Former Russian ambassador to India Vyacheslav Trubnikov used to be a journalist of the Russian news agency RIA Novosti at that time
 ek din sansad ke baahar aapas main hansi-majaak karte jyoti basu or atal bihari vaajapeyi se achaanak unka saamana ho gaya
 Surprised-troubled Trubnikov told him, "but i saw you two attacking each other in the House a while back
" '' baad main yah kissa sunaate hue unhone kaha, ''main unke ekadam badale hue haav-bhav dekhakar bhauchak rah gaya tha
 "the two leaders, who come from two completely opposing political poles, then explain to Trubnikov a lesson of political friendship
 trubnicove ne likhaa, ''unhone mujhase kaha ki bharat kaa jaandaar loktantr hamen vichaardhaara ke muddon par ek-duusare kii mukhaalafat karne kii ijaajat detaa he, lekin iskaa yah matlab nahin ki ham duusare kii izzat na karen
 This is probably because Stalin's Gulag cannot agree with us
 ''divangat basu or beemaari kii vajah se asamarth vaajapeyi, donon ko hi in dinon us mahaan siyaasi parampara ke vaarison kaa aacharan dekhakar ghor niraashaa hoti
 If the monsoon session is any indication, then there has been such a huge rift in our political strata and there is so much bitterness on both sides that there is no scope of reconciliation soon
 congress ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha tha ki jab tak sarkaar purv ipiel mukhiya lalit modi kii kathith madad karne ke liye videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj or rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ko nahin hataati or isi tarah vyapam ghotaale ke baad madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko nahin hataaya jaataa, tab tak congress sansad nahin chalane degi
 He also showed what he said
 darasal, rahul ne jab sadan ko bataaya ki swaraj ne unka haath thamkar kaha tha ki ''betaa, tum mujhase itane naaraaz kyon ho
 "then they were expressing their intention to expose the comfortable club which Parliament has become during the last few years
" beshak, hameshaa aisa nahin tha
 This new fall began in 2004, when the NDA lost the election and Swaraj and Uma Bharti threatened to shave their heads when Sonia Gandhi became Prime Minister
 aisa laga ki bijepi ko apni haar se gaharaa sadma laga tha, jisase vah ubar nahin pai
 Then the first meeting between newly elected Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and new opposition leaders Vajpayee and LK Advani was not good
 adwani or vaajapeyi apane saath charchaa ke liye jo kaagaj lekar aae the, unhen manmohan singh ne ek taraf daal diya tha
 At first glance, Congress leaders say that they are doing exactly what they did to the BJP while in power
 thode vakt ke liye yah kargar tarkeeb ho sakati he, magar ranneeti ke lihaaj se yah khaufnak najar aati he
 There is already some nervousness in the party about what strategy she will adopt in the cold session of Parliament which starts in late November
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne faisla kar liya he ki teenon netaaon ko ve nahin hataayenge, lihaaja congressjan ab isi soch-vichaar main hai ki kya unhen apni izzat bachaane kii khatir sansad kaa ek or satr thap karnaa padegaa
 Chandan Mitra, a Rajya Sabha MP and editor of the Pioneer newspaper, says, "if the Congress comes to a standstill, then how will public sentiment go against it
" '' bijepi ke sutara kehete hai ki bhoomi vidheyak par congress ke chaahe gaye kai sanshodhano ko sweekaar karne ke baad vitt mantri arun jetali ne vastu or seva kar (jiesti) vidheyak par congress netaaon ke saath takaraav khatm karne ke liye kadam badhaayaa tha
 But he was returned on the back foot that the conversation could begin with resignations
 jetali ne india today se kaha, ''vaajapeyi ke jamaane main (purv videsh mantri) jaswant singh ek rajasthani kahawat sunaaya karte the ki agar aap ped par chadhvaa chaahate hai, to kam se kam ek daal par pair majbootee se jarur rakhana chahie, taaki usase neeche utar sako
 However, a large part of the BJP feels uncomfortable with Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan's decision to suspend 25 Congress mps for five days
 kehete hai, yah faisla 'shikhar' se yani piem ke str se liya gaya tha
 That one decision undermined the mediation between the BJP and the Congress

 The pressure on the top leadership to pass the GST Bill has increased after the mouth of the land bill
 iske liye do din kaa chota-sa satr bulaane kii sambhaavna par kai vipakshi dalon ke saath anaupchaarik baatcheet ke daravaaje khole gaye hai
 It is said that Jaitley is right to call such a session, but other party leaders warn against the risk of defeat
 rajyasabha main bijepi ke 48 saansad hai or uski ranneeti yah he ki congress ko alag-thalag karke aarthik sudhaaron ke morche par baaki vipakshi dalon ko saath laayaa jaae
 The Trinamool Congress (12 mps) and the Samajwadi Party (15 mps) are ready, but show that Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party (12 mps) is wavering

 The JD (U), Congress (68 mps) and the Left parties (11 mps) will vote against the government if the vote is split
 jiesti samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak he or ise paarit karne ke liye sadan main maujuud do-tihaai sadasyon kaa iske paksh main vot dena jaruri he, isliye saansadon kaa jod bijepi ke haq main nahin jaataa
 a senior BJP leader admitted that the party had decided to postpone the GST Bill by mid-2016
 us vakt tak rajyasabha kii kai siton par chehre badal jaaenge or zyaadaatar badlaav bijepi ke haq main honge
 76 mps of the Rajya Sabha will retire next year (including 21 from Congress and 17 from BJP)
 haalanki bijepi ke kai saansad dobaaraa chunakar aa jaaenge, khaskar nae jite hue rajyon maharashtra, jharkhand or haryana se
 This is bad news for the Congress, as it means that regional parties like BSP and SP will place their bets very carefully
 iskaa yah bhi matlab he ki modi ne tay kar liya he ki sonia se haath milaane ke liye ve lakshmana rekha paar nahin karenge
 During the adjournment motion of the Congress, when Sushma Swaraj defended her relationship with Lalit Modi, Prime Minister Modi's absence in the House was considered indecisive
 modi mushkil se hi sadan main aae hai

 Praise publicly that these officers said what they thought was right in the public interest
 in afasaron kaa yah kahana kam saahasik nahin he ki durghatana ke chand ghanton ke bheetar in donon kaa daura nai museebataan paidaa kar gaya
 The Prime Minister and Rahul Gandhi should have visited after a couple of days
 ham dikhaau raajnneeti kii galakat pratispardhaa ke daur main ji rahe hai
 The leader considers each moment to be a photo, and the public is transparent
 lihaaza kisi se mil kar baahar aae nahin ki ek photo twit ho jaataa he
 Every leader is now a victim of this competition
 durghatana hui nahin ki vahaan pahunchnaa jaruri ho jaataa he
 An organization immediately starts making its picture viral by chance, as if all the rescue work is being done through it
 vahaan or bhi log hote hai lekin vah to apni tasviir soshal media par viral nahin karavaate or to or in tasveeron ko lekar chele chapatt usee vakt photo ke bahaane unki mahanata kaa bakhaan karne lagate hai jaise pahunchnaa hi antim samvedansheeltaa he
 One must think that where more than a hundred people died, hundreds were injured and the area was filled with the smell of explosives, the Prime Minister's arrival at that time was right? The way the police and health services chiefs of Kerala have told the Indian Express that it seems that the administration has suffered a lot due to these visits
 acchhee baat he ki in adhikariyon ne media main aakar bayaan diya he taaki aage ke liye koi parampara ban sake
 There is a code of disaster management all over the world
 bharat main bhi he or vah bhi kaaphi acha he
 Despite this, our leaders do not understand the difference between disaster management and their publicity

 Do you know if someone has lost his life due to these visits? tippaniyan It should be probed whether the Prime Minister and Rahul Gandhi and all the people who accompanied him had taken off shoes before entering ICU? Was the hospital's apron worn? Wore a hat? How did the photographer go to ICU? How did they become so close so soon? With whose permission did they go to ICU? The statement of R
 Ramesh suggests that despite his opposition, some leaders and some people accompany him to the ICU
 ai si you kaa apana ek protocol hota he jo piem ke protocol se bhi zyaada samvedansheel hota he
 a slight omission can spread the infection and the patient may die
 jaruri he ki is chook par donon netaaon kaa paksh saamne aae
 These two leaders should write a letter of regret and decide amongst themselves that they will avoid reaching the accident site immediately
 kuch saal pehle jab antkavaadi ghatnaayen lagaataar ho rahi thim tab yah bahes bhi hui thi ki kya us vakt jab aspataalon main jaan bachaane ke liye sau chizon kii jarurat hoti he viipi kaa photo khinchaau daura zaruri he? jahaan tak mujhe dhyaan aa rahaa he ki viipi ne janaa kam kar diya tha

 puri duniya main aapadaa prabandhan kaa ek code he
 Also in India and that too is quite good
 iske baavjood hamaare netaa aapadaa prabandhan or apni publicity main fark nahin samaj pate
 Kerala Police Chief TP Senkumar told The Indian Express that he had objected to the Prime Minister and Rahul Gandhi's visit to Kollam when his police were engaged in rescue operations
 senkumar ne do tuk kah diya ki behatar hoga ki piem ek din baad durghatanasthal par jaayen lekin piem usee din aana chaahate the
 We were stuck in work
 maine siem ko bhi samajhaayaa lekin ek baar daure kaa elaan ho gaya to hamen suraksha kii zimmedaari uthaani padi
 The Government of Kerala, taking care of the dignity of the PM, gave a statement that his visit was not difficult, but one can understand Senkumar's words with ease
 solah april ke express main isi se judi ek or khabar chhapi he
 This time the state's Director General of Health r Ramesh has said that it was inappropriate for the Prime Minister and Rahul Gandhi to come to the ICU of Burn Ward
 mujhe yah bayaan pard kar hairaani hui ki itane bade netaaon se ai si you main jane kii naadaani kaise ho sakati he ? khaaskar bern ward ke ai si you main jahaan sankraman kaa khatra hota he
 The biggest challenge is to prevent burns from infection
 swasthya sevaaon ke mahanideshak ramesh ne jo bayaan diya he vah or bhi sharmnaak he
 The security personnel pushed Ramesh and the doctor
 kya ve nahin dekh sake ki aspataal main doctoron ko aana janaa jaruri he na ki pradhanmantri yaa rahul gandhi kaa
 He had to argue that it was very important for him to go in, then he was let go
 ramesh ne bataaya ki mariz jab najuk haalat main aspataal laayaa jaataa he use golden aavar kehete hai
 It is a very important time in which it costs a moment to save a patient's life
 aar ramesh ne kaha ki sirf modi or rahul hi nahin unke saath anya log or photographer bhi ai si you main ghus aae
 i opposed it but we were not listened to
 photographer? ai si you main? aap ravivaar ko channelon par chali ek ek tasviir ko yaad kijiye
 It seemed that arrangements had been made to reach the camera everywhere
 surgery team kii ek nurse ne bayaan diya he ki use or uski chaar sahyogiyon ko pradhanmantri ke surakshakarmiyon ne roak diya
 She could not go to the operation theater

 Kerala Police Chief TP Senkumar told The Indian Express that he had objected to the Prime Minister and Rahul Gandhi's visit to Kollam when his police were engaged in rescue operations
 senkumar ne do tuk kah diya ki behatar hoga ki piem ek din baad durghatanasthal par jaayen lekin piem usee din aana chaahate the
 We were stuck in work
 maine siem ko bhi samajhaayaa lekin ek baar daure kaa elaan ho gaya to hamen suraksha kii zimmedaari uthaani padi
 The Government of Kerala, taking care of the dignity of the PM, gave a statement that his visit was not difficult, but one can understand Senkumar's words with ease
 solah april ke express main isi se judi ek or khabar chhapi he
 This time the state's Director General of Health r Ramesh has said that it was inappropriate for the Prime Minister and Rahul Gandhi to come to the ICU of Burn Ward
 mujhe yah bayaan pard kar hairaani hui ki itane bade netaaon se ai si you main jane kii naadaani kaise ho sakati he ? khaaskar bern ward ke ai si you main jahaan sankraman kaa khatra hota he
 The biggest challenge is to prevent burns from infection
 swasthya sevaaon ke mahanideshak ramesh ne jo bayaan diya he vah or bhi sharmnaak he
 The security personnel pushed Ramesh and the doctor
 kya ve nahin dekh sake ki aspataal main doctoron ko aana janaa jaruri he na ki pradhanmantri yaa rahul gandhi kaa
 He had to argue that it was very important for him to go in, then he was let go
 ramesh ne bataaya ki mariz jab najuk haalat main aspataal laayaa jaataa he use golden aavar kehete hai
 It is a very important time in which it costs a moment to save a patient's life
 aar ramesh ne kaha ki sirf modi or rahul hi nahin unke saath anya log or photographer bhi ai si you main ghus aae
 i opposed it but we were not listened to
 photographer? ai si you main? aap ravivaar ko channelon par chali ek ek tasviir ko yaad kijiye
 It seemed that arrangements had been made to reach the camera everywhere
 surgery team kii ek nurse ne bayaan diya he ki use or uski chaar sahyogiyon ko pradhanmantri ke surakshakarmiyon ne roak diya
 She could not go to the operation theater
 us vakt ai si you main bhartee ek mariz kii haalat kaaphi bighad gai thi
 We had to run to another block but were stopped for half an hour
 kya pataa in dauron kii vajah se kisi kii jaan chali gai ho
 The comments baqayda isaki jaanch honi chahie ki kya pradhanmantri or rahul gandhi or unke saath gaye tamaam logon ne ai si you main ghusane se pehle juute utaare the? aspataal kaa diya epran pahana tha? topi pahani thi? photographer kaise ai si you main chale gaye? itani jaldi unka paas kaise ban gaya? kiski ijazat se ve ai si you main gaye? aar ramesh ke bayaan se lagata he ki unke virodh ke baavjood ai si you main netaa or unke saath kuch log gaye

 a few years ago, when terrorist incidents were constantly happening, there was a debate as to whether a photograph of VIP visit is necessary when a hundred things are needed to save lives in hospitals? As far as i am concerned, VIP had reduced the go
 zarurat he phir se is par baat ho or ek majboot parampara qaayam kii jaae
 Another news related to this has appeared in the express of April 16
 is baar rajya ke swasthya mahanideshak aar ramesh ne kaha he ki pradhanmantri or rahul gandhi kaa bern ward ke ai si you main aana gairazaruri tha
 i was surprised to read this statement that how can such big leaders have the ignorance to go to ICU? Especially in the ICU of Burn Ward where there is a risk of infection
 jaale hue ko sankraman se bachaana hi sabase badi chunauti hoti he
 The statement made by Director General of Health Services Ramesh is even more embarrassing
 surakshakarmiyon ne ramesh or doctor ko dhakel diya
 Could they not see that it is necessary for the doctors to come to the hospital and not the Prime Minister or Rahul Gandhi
 unhen bahes kerani padi ki unka andar janaa bahut zaruri he tab unhen jane diya gaya
 Ramesh told that when the patient is brought to the hospital in critical condition, it is called Golden Hour
 vah kaaphi ahm samay hota he jisamen mariz kii jaan bachaane ke liye ek ek pal kii qeemat hoti he
 r Ramesh said that not only Modi and Rahul, along with him other people and photographers also entered ICU
 maine iskaa virodh kiya lekin hamaari nahin suni gai
 Photographer? In icu? Remember a picture that was played on the channels on Sunday
 lagata tha ki har jagah camere ke pahunchane kaa bandobast kiya gaya he
 a nurse from the surgery team has said that she and her four colleagues were stopped by the Prime Minister's security personnel
 ve aaparishan theatre main nahin ja sakin
 At that time, the condition of a patient admitted to ICU had deteriorated significantly
 hamen bhagkar duusare block main janaa tha lekin aadhe ghante tak ke liye roak diya gaya
 Do you know if someone has lost his life due to these visits? tippaniyan It should be probed whether the Prime Minister and Rahul Gandhi and all the people who accompanied him had taken off shoes before entering ICU? Was the hospital's apron worn? Wore a hat? How did the photographer go to ICU? How did they become so close so soon? With whose permission did they go to ICU? The statement of R
 Ramesh suggests that despite his opposition, some leaders and some people accompany him to the ICU
 ai si you kaa apana ek protocol hota he jo piem ke protocol se bhi zyaada samvedansheel hota he
 a slight omission can spread the infection and the patient may die
 jaruri he ki is chook par donon netaaon kaa paksh saamne aae
 These two leaders should write a letter of regret and decide amongst themselves that they will avoid reaching the accident site immediately
 kuch saal pehle jab antkavaadi ghatnaayen lagaataar ho rahi thim tab yah bahes bhi hui thi ki kya us vakt jab aspataalon main jaan bachaane ke liye sau chizon kii jarurat hoti he viipi kaa photo khinchaau daura zaruri he? jahaan tak mujhe dhyaan aa rahaa he ki viipi ne janaa kam kar diya tha
 There is a need to discuss it again and establish a strong tradition
 swasthya sevaaon ke mahanideshak ramesh ne jo bayaan diya he vah or bhi sharmnaak he

 Although parents have given videogames to children who have become an integral part of their lives, experts and doctors believe that they are turning their natural innocent thinking and turning them towards violence
 bacchon ko behatar bhautik suvidhaon se bharpoor jivan dene ke liye din-raat paise kamaane main jute abhibhavak is choti magar behad jaruri baat par dhyaan hi nahin dete
 By the time they understand this, it is too late
 iske bare main fortis aspataal kii manovishleshak doctor vandana prakaash ne bataaya, ‘video game bacchon kii maasoomiyat ko khatm kar rahe hai
 Most of the videogames made today only show violence and feelings of revenge
 anjaane main bachche vahi sikhte hai
 She says, "violence is also shown in Mario, the most famous video game among children
 aajkal sidi ho yaa internet video game sabhi kii theme hinsa hi hoti he
 In it, children have to fire and kill people
 aise main bacchon ko dhire-dhire in baton main koi buraai najar nahin aati
 Rakesh, a psychoanalyst who works on the psychology of children, says, "the evil feeling of violence against violence in the minds of children begins to disappear by playing violent video games
 vah dhire-dhire hinsa ko bhi saamaanya kaaryon kii tarah maanane lagata he
 Such video games have a profound impact on children's behavior
 ’doctor prakaash kahati hai, ‘kai baar sunne ko miltaa he ki aajkal chote bachche apane bhai bahanon kii hatya kar dete hai
 Throwing them off the roof or stabbing them, these violent programs and video games have a huge hand behind them all
 ’shishu rog visheshgy doctor sucheta dinakar kahati hai, ‘video game zyada khilne se bacchon ke dilo dimag par bahut kharaab asar padataa he, jisase unki puri soch prabhavit hoti he or vah anjaane main hi hinsa or aparaadh ko saamaanya maanane lagate hai
 'she says,' playing video games does not just have the effect
 isse sharir par bhi bura asar padataa he
 Children sit in front of the computer for hours playing video games
 isse dry ai kii pareshaani hoti he
 The way children sit while playing games is not correct, leading to complaints of neck and back pain
 ghanto game khelte rahane ke dauraan bachche kuch kuch khate rahete hai
 This increases obesity in children and due to reduced physical activity, their physical development is also affected
 ’doctor rakesh kehete hai, ‘chote bacchon kaa man ek kaagaj kii tarah hota he, vah jo bhi dekhte hai, vaisaa hi karne lagate hai
 These days, the video games that have the craze of the most children are bonus rounds, invisible walls, Batman, mortal combat, punch time exploration and cross fire etc
 inamen zyaadaatar hinsa se bharpoor hai
 There is only action in all these games
 isse bacchon main hinsa kii pravriti badhati he
 'dr Prakash says that children should be stopped from playing video games for a long time so that their childhood is innocent and clean
 congress jisko apana turup kaa ikkaa maanati he, congressi arase se uske intazaar main hai
 The party says that she is going to come, but when she will come and on what scale, she probably has not told anyone yet
 ji haa, ham baat kar rahe hai priyanka gandhi wadra kii
 After UP, the voice has now come from another electoral state of Punjab and there is no shout-out leader, but the party's state president himself is Captain Amarinder Singh
 amarinder singh chaahate hai ki rahul ke saath priyanka bhi punjab aaen or party ke liye prachaar karen
 In fact, in UP, Priyanka was first asked to campaign out of Rae bareli-amethi
 samuhik postaron main priyanka nazar bhi aane lageen
 But with the condition that his picture should not be larger than Rahul and not his poster alone
 haal main upi congress ke adhyaksh raaj babbar or prachaar samiti ke adhyaksh sanjay singh ne priyanka gandhi se mulaakaat kar elaan kiya tha ki voribareli-amethike baahar prachaar karne ko taiyaar hai, lekin kaarykram chunavi tarikhon ke elaan ke baad hi banegaa
 Perhaps hearing this, Amarinder's desire has also arisen
 aise main jab punjab kaa siem banane kaa khwab sanjoe amarinder sab kuch jhonk rahe hai
 They know that this time if not now then never again
 isliye bhala unako congressiyon ke turup ke ikke kii yaad kaise nahin aati
 Perhaps along with star campaigners like Rahul Gandhi, Navjot Sidhu, there is also hope of using Captain Priyanka as a superstar campaigner
 par sawaal yahi he ki upi congress se prachaar ke liye hami bhar chukin priyanka kya captain kaa kaha bhi maan lengi

 musharraf ne haal hi main ek media intervyuu main sweekaar kiya tha ki pakistan ne kashmir main aatankwaad ko badhaava dene ke liye 1990 ke dashak main lashkar-e-taiyaba jaise aatankwaadi sanghathanon kii madad kii thi or unhen training di thi
 The 72-year-old Musharraf said that terrorists like Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-zawahiri used to be the heroes of Pakistan at first, but later became villains

 He said that once again the real face of Pakistan has been revealed
 tippaniyan Congress leader Manish Tiwari said that due to Partition, there is bitterness in both India and Pakistan, in which millions of people lost their lives
 unhone kaha, 'bharat main pakistan virdohi vibhaajankaree bayaan or pakistan main bharat virdohi bayaan hote rahete hai or donon taraf aise log hai jo isse phayda uthaate hai

 pichley ek dashak main sarkaar ne ucch shiksha ke takneekee sansthaanon jaise iiem, enity, iity, neshnal lau univasti or ames kii sthapana kii he
 This has increased the GER (gross enrollment rate) of students in higher education and has come down to 9 per cent, which is 6 per cent below the average global rate
 america or australia jaise deshon kii tulana main to yah 50 fisadi se bhi kam he
 The government is trying to bring it down to 30 per cent by 2020
 nascom ke ek survey ke anusaar desh main 2014 tak kul 10 karod yuva 17 se 19 varsh ke bich the
 Out of these, 2 crore students reach higher education
 baaki 80 fisadi log kisi-na-kisi kaaran se peeche rah jate hai
 Therefore, there are sufficient number of students pursuing higher education in the country
 lekin desh main ucch shiksha ke ejiniers, itii, farmesi, hotel management, prabandh sansthaaon aadi main pichley do—teen saalon main record giravat bhi dekhne ko mili he
 Institutions made up of billions of rupees of government are waiting for the students
 sabhi rajyon main takneekee sansthaaon main ucch shiksha ke prati chaatro kaa rukh udaseenta vaala rahaa he
 In the last two years, more than 30 per cent of private sector institutions have either closed down or they have reduced their seats
 zyaadaatar ejineering college, prabandhan santhaan, farmesi or ucch shiksha ke collejon kii bahut-si shakhaon or corson ke prati chaatro kaa rujhaan bhi kam hua he
 Taking advantage of the liberal policy of the government, many institutions opened many colleges and increased the number of seats in them
 ek pari kii jagah sansthaaon ko do-do pariyon main chalaaya, jisase ucch or takneekee shiksha ke kshetra main maang or aapurti kaa santulan gadabada gaya
 This made the placement of the students very low or average
 isliye chaatr shikshan sansthaaon se vimukh hote ja rahe hai
 Some concrete steps need to be taken to improve higher and technical education
 aaie dekhen ve kadam kya ho sakate hai:- rashtriya str par ucch or takneekee shiksha ke sabhi sansthaanon ke liye ''ek pravesh pariksha, ek paathyakram or ek fees'' kii paddati lagu kii jaani chahie
 - Higher and technical education courses should be based on research / practical and training
 - rashtriya str par ucch or takneekee shiksha ke paathyakram or suvidhaon ko bazaar ke anuroop or samyaanukool banaaya jaae
 - For professional courses, similar courses and same admission policy should be organized all over the country
 isse vibhinn parikshaon kii taiyaari karne main chaatro ke samay or dhan kii barbaadi nahin hogi or ve ek hi lakshya par puri tarah focus kar paaenge
 - In higher education institutions, the number of students in training courses should be more than 75 percent and they should be made of high quality work
 - koi bhi nai takanic yadi bazaar main aati he to usko ucch shiksha ke kendron main laana chahie, jisase chaatro main acchhee samaj kshamta viksit ho
 - Teachers should be sent from time to time on two to three months training so that they can explain new technology to their students
 - chaatro ko desh bhar main kuch samay ke liye duusare rajyon kii ucch shikshan sansthaaon main padhgaye ke liye bheja janaa chahie
 If our government does not keep going in time, then in the coming times, educational institutions will become centers of knowledge and jobless centers and unemployment generating centers
 aaj hamaare paas samay he ki ham ise skill india se joden or ucch skill yaa kaushal viksit karne ke centre khole jaaen
 Book knowledge should be eradicated
 (lekhak apeks group of institutions (jaipur-kota) ke siio hai) According to Pakistani army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor, the decision to arrest Hafiz Saeed has been made in the new 'national policy and national interest'
 hafiz jamaat-ud-daawa kaa mukhiya or 2008 main mumbai aatanki hamale kaa aaropee he
 The US has placed a bounty of $ 10 million on Hafiz's head and India considers him the "mastermind" of the Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including many American citizens, were killed
 use 2002 se 2009 tak kam se kam chaar baar hiraasat main liya gaya lekin kuch maheenon baad chhod dena padaa
 Hafiz is popular because of his anti-american and anti-india speeches
 magar fouj ke andruni sutron kii maane to 30 janvari ko lahore main hafiz kii ghar main najarbandi teji se badalte gharelu or antarrashtriya maahaul kii vajah se he
 This changing environment includes changes in the command of the Pakistani army and the new Donald Trump government in America
 ahm yah bhi he ki hafiz ko is baar pakistan anti-teror act jaise sakht kanoon ke tahat pakadaa gaya he
 The image of Pakistan's new army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, is of progressive choice and human liking
 unke siyaasi aakaa, pradhanmantri navaj sharif 2013 main satta main aane ke saath hi bharat ke saath rishte saamaanya karne kii koshish karte rahe hai
 But reportedly their efforts have become meaningless due to Pakistani terrorists successive attacks in India and unrest in Kashmir in India
 november 2016 main bajva ko niyukt karne ke kuch din pehle sharif ne mujhase kaha tha, 'doharepan kii nitiyon—kuch aatankwaadiyon ko shah or kuch kii dhar-pakad—kaa virodhabhas jaldi hi khatm ho jayega
 'in this way, the arrest of Saeed, a jihadist against India, a knowledgeable Quran and long-standing official figure, is being linked to changes in the domestic and international situation
 said kii giraftaar ke mahaj 24 ghante baad 31 janvari ko rawalpindi ke fouj mukhyalay main ek patrkaar vaarta ke vakt alag se ek varisht faujee adhikari ne naam na chhapane kii shart par kaha, ''china or america ke hamaare doston ke nae sanket hai ki use pakado
 The US and the United Nations are asking why the government is not able to control this person? ”major General Ghafoor said that the new army chief has a firm intention to improve Pakistan's security situation
 unhone kaha, ''agar pakistan sudhar jaataa he or fouj pramukh kabr main bhi pahunch jate hai tab bhi unhen afsos na hoga
 For General Bajwa, the country is more important than some people
 mulk kaa bhala hameshaa upar hona chahie
 "as far as the pressure of the Trump government in the US is concerned, his answer was," "there is all kinds of pressure from all over the world
" ham khala main nahin jite hai
 Such a big decision is not taken suddenly
 ''vaayu sena ke purv adhikari tathaa charchit tivi tippaneekar shahzad choudhary kehete hai, ''jaahir he, badalte maahaul se pakistan main pratikriya hogi
 An arrest is a good decision
 hamaara ajij dost china isse khush hoga kyonki hamaari vajah se use jhenpna nahin padegaa
 America will be happy that we listened to it
 hamaare khilaaf duniya bhar main shikaayat karne kaa bharat ke paas ek ahm mudda nahin rah jayega
 And Mr
 Saeed must also understand that if he has to choose between him and Pakistan, Pakistan will be chosen

 '' assam kii jeet se ati utsahit bijepi ne upi vidhansabha chunaav kii taiyaariyaan abhi se shuru kar di he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are well aware that before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the Uttar Pradesh assembly election in 2017 is a knock-out quarter-final match before the final
 isamen haarane ke baad bhi bijepi 2019 kaa final match jarur khelegi bas jeetne kii guarantee 40 fisadi rah jaaegi
 Therefore, Amit Shah has shifted his entire focus to UP
 soshal ejineering kii pehali peshkash hai keshav mauryaupi main chunaav jeetne ke liye bijepi ne is barupi kii jatigat raajnneetiko dhyaan main rakhkar hi pichhadi jati ke vot bank main send lagane ke liye keshav prasad maury ko upi bijepi kaa adhyaksh banaaya or soshal ejineering kii bisaat bichhaani shuru kar di
 The work of social engineering of BJP in UP is being done by Amit Shah himself and Om Prakash Mathur, in-charge of UP and confidant of PM Narendra Modi
 nakvi ko isliye jharkhand se bheja rajyasabhajatigat samikarnon ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ko jharkhand se rajyasabha bheja ja rahaa he
 He was replaced by Shiva Pratap Shukla, an old Brahmin face in the UP BJP
 kyonki bijepi ke soshal ejiniers ye achche se jaanate hai ki upi membijapi ko muslim voten ke baraabar milegaa
 Sending Naqvi to Rajya Sabha from UP does not send a good message to the bjp's core vote bank
 iskaa asar upi chunaav ke nateezon main dikhaai detaa
 In making the district president the backward castes preferred, so this time the party kept caste equations in mind while making the district president
 pichley 20 saalon main upi 80 pratishat se 90 pratishat jila adhyaksh brahman or thakur hi banaae jate the
 This time 44 out of 94 district presidents and city presidents are from backward and very backward caste, 29 Brahmins, 10 Thakurs, 9 Vaishyas and 4 Dalits from the society
 bijepi ne jis tarah se 2010 main nitish kumaar ke saath milakar bihar menmahadalit card kii raajnneetike aadhaar par jis tarah se lalu yadav kii argedy or ramvilas paswan kii lokjan shakti party ke gathbandhan kaa bihar se puraa supada saaf kar diya tha
 In a similar way, by multiplying the caste equations, the BJP wants to win the victory in UP
 upi main yadav, jatav or muslim milakar 35 pratishat hai
 The BJP is eyeing the remaining 65 percent
 bijepi ke soshal ejiniers ko lagata hai pichhadi or agadi jatiyon ke samanvay ke aadhaar par upi main bijepi kii bahaar aa sakati he
 Nishad and Dalit castes are being cast on dorebjp
 This time, all preparations have been started to make a dent in the vote bank of Mayawati (BSP)
 kanpur se lekar varanasi tak zyaadaatar vidhansabhaon main lagbhag 10 hajaar se 15 hajaar tak nishad jati kaa vot he
 That is why BJP is associating Nishad caste leaders with itself
 isaki shuruyaat bijepi ne bispi se seat naa milane se naaraaz ram bharuhal nishad ko bijepi main laane ke liye unase baatcheet shuru bhi kar di he
 The BJP has also begun to lash out at the leaders of the Nishad and Dalit castes of UP
 tathakthith choti jatiyon main bade asar kii taiyaaribijepi ne choti-choti ati pichhadi jatiyon ko apni taraf kheenchna bhi shuru kar diya he
 Such as the Rajbhar caste has influence in the assembly seats of several other districts including Deoria, Ballia, Azamgarh, Salempur and Ghazipur
 in vidhansabhaon main rajbhar samaaj ke 30 hajaar se 40 hajaar tak vot hai
 Understanding the importance of Rajbhar society in UP elections, BJP President Amit Shah addressed the Rajbhar Samaj rally in Varanasi last year
 bijepi chunaav se pehle ashok rajbhar kii party bhartiya samaaj party kaa vilay bijepi main karnaa chaahati he yaa phir 10 siten dekar unke saath gathbandhan karne kii firaaq main he
 The Brahm Chetna Yatra of a Buddhist mendicant was launched by Home Minister Rajnath Singh on April 24 from Varanasi to make a dent in the bsp's vote bank Buddhist community
 ye brahm chetana yatra oktober tak puure upi main 130 vidhansabhaon main jaaegi
 Local BJP leaders and workers will welcome the yatra in every assembly

 Apna Dal has a significant influence in about 30 assembly seats in Pratapgarh, Jaunpur, Allahabad, Varanasi and Mirzapur
 bijepi ko lagata he ki in choti-choti partiyon ke saath aane se purvanchal or varanasi se sate jilon kii 110 se 120 siton par bijepi itani majboot ho jaaegi ki use haraa paanaa har kisi ke liye dur kii kaudi hoga
 Shah and Rajnath will continue to rally in Saharanpur, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has played the bugle of elections on the completion of two years of the rallying center
 mangalvaar klymit shah elahabadamein dalit parivaar main bhojan karne ke baad kisaanon kaa samelan karenge
 In the next one month, Amit Shah has to organize 6 workers

 Home Minister Rajnath Singh will also hold 6 public meetings throughout UP
 rajnath singh 5 june ko amroha main or 9 june ko mau main raily ko sambodhit karne vaale hai
 Ujjwala scheme scheme will get direct benefit in this election BJP will try to give 7 thousand to 8 thousand gas connections in every assembly to poor families by the end of December

 BJP believes that they will get the benefit in the assembly elections

 Jamal (iamaaj) (@picsrkaaj) on Nov 1, 2017 at 11:58 pm PDT upi vidhansabha ke chunaav main aaj saatven charan ke 7 jilon kii 40 siton ke liye matdaan hona he
 All political parties have put their full strength before the seventh phase of voting
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne lagaataar teen din varanasi main hi deraa daale rakhaa
 PM Modi held three rallies and two road shows in Varanasi in these three days
 iske saath hi piem modi purv pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri ke ghar gaye or gadwa ghat par yadav samaaj ke guru se bhi mulaakaat kii
 It is clear from the hard work of PM Modi that BJP does not want to risk a single seat in the seventh phase elections
 varanasi main gathbandhan ke paksh main maahaul banane ke liye akhilesh yadav aurrahul gandhi ne bhi ek road sho kiyasath hi bispi supremeo mayawati ne bhi antim charan main varanasi or uske aas-paas ke ilaakon main bispi ke liye vot maange
 Despite campaigning by big leaders of all parties, there is also a section that will not vote in the seventh phase
 anganwari main kaam karne vaali mahilayen ne saatven charan main matdaan naa karne kaa faisla liya he
 He complains that no political party is aware of the problems of women working in Anganwadi
 anganwari main kaam karne vaali mahilaon kaa aarope hai ki sabhi raajnneetik dal unhen apane netaaon kii raily main lekar jate hai or bharosa dete hai ki netaa unki samasyaon kaa zikr karne ke saath-saath agali sarkaar banate hi unkevetan samet sabhi samasyaon kaa jald hi nidaan karenge
 But the leader of any political party did not even mention his problems
 isi ke maddenjar anganwari varkar aakhri charan main matdaan nahin karengi
 Even if their number and influence is less, but about 40 thousand Anganwadi workers of Purvanchal will not use their franchise this time
 upi vidhansabha chunaav main sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko chunaav jeetne ke liye puraa damakham lagaana pad rahaa he or itane kam vot bank par koi dhyaan bhi nahin de rahaa hai jo jati-dharm se alag he
 Despite this, every single vote is important in its democracy

 The Finance Minister made it clear that despite increasing the foreign investment limit, the managerial control of private insurance companies would remain in Indian hands and proposals for investment would have to be approved by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB)
 is pahal se beemaa companiyon ko videshi bhagidaaron se bahu-pratikshit puunji praapt karne main madad milegi
 The proposal to increase the FDI limit has been pending since 2008, while the previous UPA government had brought the Insurance Act (amendment Bill) to increase foreign shareholding in insurance joint ventures from 26 percent to 49 percent
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar jaldi hi is sambandh main vidheyak ko aage badhayegi
 Regarding the defense sector, Jaitley said that in the case of foreign exchange, the combined limit is being raised to 49 percent, which would be subject to the conditions of full Indian management and acceptance of FIPB

 mana jaataa he ki rudraksh kii utpatti bhagwaan shiv ke aansuon se hui he or isko pracheen kaal se hi aabhushan kii tarah pahana jaataa rahaa he
 Rudraksha is the only thing on this earth that is considered best for chanting mantras and controlling planets
 jyotishiyon ke anusaar rudraksh kii visheshtaon or mahima kaa bakhaan shastron main bhi khub kiya gaya he
 This ornament of Rudraksh's ancient era is considered to be perfect for chanting mantras and controlling planets
 rudraksh ke prayog se ham shani kii pidaa ko bhi dur kar sakate hai
 One can also get the grace of Shani Dev by using Rudraksha
 rudraksh ko dhaaran karne ke liye kuch niyamon kaa paalan behad jaruri hota he
 The importance of Shani and the strength of Asrudraksha is so much that some of its special rules are religions, and if those rules are not followed, then bad fruits also begin
 lekin jyotishiyon kii maane to rudraksh kaa sahi dhang se prayog kiya jaae to shani kii tedi najar se hone vaale kashton se bhi aap mukti paa sakate hai
 Let us first tell you what is the importance of Shani and what effect it has on our life
 
 
 - shani hamaare jivan main har tarah ke karm or uske fal se sambandhit he
 Saturn is the ruler of punishment, so it also punishes our misdeeds
 - shani kii krupa se hi rojgaar miltaa bhi he or chalata bhi he
 If Saturn is painful then the amount of struggle in life increases
 - vyakti ko rojgaar se lekar swasthya tak har jagah mushkilen hoti hai
 - When Saturn is favorable, there is no struggle in life and you get success
 rudraksh dhaaran karne ke niyamajyothish ke jaankaron kii maane to jivan main aane vaale sangharsho ko dur karne ke liye rudraksh ke istemaal karne ke kuch khaas upaay hai
 If these measures are done with strict rules, then Saturn gets relief from suffering
 aaie jaane, rudraksh dhaaran karne ke niyamon ke bare main
 
 
 - Rudraksha can be worn on the wrist, throat and heart
 - ise gale main dhaaran karnaa sarvottam hogise kalai main 12, gale main 36 or hryday par 108 daanon ko dhaaran karnaa chahie
 - One can wear Rudraksha in Lala thread till the heart
 - sawan main, somvaar ko or shivaratri ke din rudraksh dhaaran karnaa sarvottam hota he
 Before wearing Rudraksha, he should be dedicated to Shiva
 - usee maala yaa rudraksh par mantra jaap karnaa chahie
 - Whoever is wearing Rudraksha should remain sattvic and Rudraksha does not benefit if the practice is not kept pure
 shani ke liye rudraksh kaa prayogshani kii pidaa se nipatane ke liye rudraksh ke prayog in niyamon se karneper jaldi raahat milti he
 Now in such a situation, the question arises as to how Rudraksha should be used to overcome the obstacles of Saturn
 aaie jaane har samasya kaa kaise hoga samaadhaan
 
 
 In the problem of employment - for this, you should wear ten Mukhi Rudraksha
 - ise shanivaar ko laal dhaage main gale main dhaaran karen
 - It will be beneficial to wear 3 ten face Rudraksha together
 swasthya kii samasya ho to- iske liye shanivaar ko gale main 8 mukhi rudraksh dhaaran karen
 - Wear only eight Mukhi Rudraksha or 54 eight Mukhi Rudraksha together
 shani kii sadhesati yaa dhaiya ho toshani kii saadhe saati yaa dhaiyya main milane vaale kashton ko dur karne liye kis rudraksh kaa kaise istemaal karnaa he ise bhi jaan len
 
 
 For this, wear a rosary of Rudraksha around your neck, if this garland is of five faces, Rudraksha will be good
 - dhaaran karne ke pehle isi maala se shani or shiv ji kaa mantra jaap karen
 To avoid the inauspicious effects of Saturn in the horoscope - Wear one Mukhi and eleven Mukhi Rudraksha together
 - isamen 1, ek mukhi or 2, gyaarah mukhi rudraksh rakhen
 - Put it together in red thread
 jyotishi kehete hai ki rudraksh ke is upaay se kundali main maujuud shani ke ashubh yoga bhi khatm ho jate hai
 Rudraksha has the power that gives its holder the ability to fight through all kinds of problems and overcome them
 ummid he ki aapako bhi rudraksh ke in prayogon ko khaas phayda hoga

 Seeing the manner in which State President Sachin Pilot and Congress General Secretary Ashok Gehlot came together on Tuesday at the Bundi activist conference 'mera Booth, Mera Gaurav' program, it is being said that Gehlot is now looking at national politics as well as Rajasthan politics i will give more time ashok gahalotane bijepi dwaara apatkaal ko lekar kiye ja rahe prachaar ko durbhagyapurna bataate hue kaha ki indira gandhi ne vakt ke halaat ko dekhte hue immergency lagaai thi
 Indira Gandhi is not responsible for the excesses during the Emergency
 aaj ke daur main immergency se zyada haalat kharaab hai
 Gehlot said that BJP is not insulting Indira Gandhi, but insulting Indira Gandhi, the symbol of women's power of the whole country
 unhone kaha ki yah desh kii mahilaon kaa apmaan he
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee called Indira Gandhi Durga
 jis tarah se BJP ke netaa laalkrishna adwani, murali manohar joshi, arun shouri, shatrughna sinha or ghanashyam tiwari ke jo bayaan aae hai, use dekhakar samajha ja saktaa he ki bijepi main kis tarah se taanaashaahee se kaam ho rahaa he
 Gehlotane said that it is the BJP, which during the Emergency, was moving the country and the army and the police to revolt against the government and disobeyed their orders
 ek netaa to rail kii patariyaan ukhaad phenkane kaa naaraa de rahe the
 The situation today is that the government is not allowing the legislature, executive, judiciary and media to function independently
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ho yaa amit shah ho yaa phir rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje sabhi dictator kii tarah kaam kar rahe hai
 He said that elections are about to come
 rajasthan main bijepi ko harata hua dekh pradhanmantri narendra modi or amit shah ne soobe main deraa daalane kaa faisla kiya he, lekin rajasthan kii janata is baar inaki vidaai kar degi
 Taking a dig at Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, Gehlot said that if Vasundhara has not spared Vice President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, what is Ghanshyam Tiwari and Om Mathur in front of him? Vasundhara Raje exploited Ghanshyam Tiwari and forced him to leave the party

 Many players from both teams have missed catches in both matches played so far in the four Test series between India and Australia
 inamen se kai kaich to nirnaayak sabit hue hai
 For example, in the second innings of the Pune Test, Kangaroo captain Steve Smith got three lives and took advantage of it fiercely
 is parinaam yah hua ki australia ne bharat ke saamne vishaal lakshya khadaa kar diya or team india ant main haar gai
 In the Bangalore Test, something similar happened with Team India batsman Cheteshwar Pujara and it was his innings that helped India secure a target
 haalanki in sabake bich kuch shandaar kaich bhi lapke gaye, jinamein se kuch to great kaich kii category main rahe
 These great catches also include two catches to a cricketer from Team India
 
 
 vastav main jab emes dhoni ne test cricket se sanyas liya tha, to chayankartaaon ko unke sthaan par ek aise khilaadi kii talash thi, jo wicket ke peeche or aage donon jagah kamaal dikhaa sake, kyonki dhoni jaise khilaadi kii jagah bharna aasaan nahin tha
 The selectors gave opportunities to Wriddhiman Saha in place of Dhoni and gradually, Saha has started making his mark
 saaha ne nakeval balle se kamaal kiya he, balki wicketiper ke rup main bhi prabhavi rahe hai
 Especially in the current series against Australia, he has done amazing keeping
 sabase pehle unhone pune test main sabko hatprabh kiya, phir bengaluru main bhi gajab kaa kaich pakadakar sabko apana kaayal bana liya
 He has caught two World Class catches in two matches against Australia, which has become unforgettable for the fans
 haalanki jab saaha se poocha gaya ki unke liye koun-sa kaich zyada ucch koti kaa rahaa, to unhone kaha ki unki najar main pune test match ke dauraan liya gaya kaich bengaluru main test match ke kaich se kahin adhik kathin tha
 By the way, Saha's choice seems right, because the catch time he caught in the Pune Test, the reaction time was very short, he was also a fast bowler on the bowling
 unhone tej gendbaaj umesh yadav kii gend par yah kaich pakadaa tha, jo mathew vade kaa tha
 Umesh went backward after touching the edge of Wade's bat in the leg side and Saha caught him diving to the right
 tippaniyan Talking about the Bengaluru Test, Saha caught the catch off spin bowler Ravichandran Ashwin
 chunki spinner kii gend dhimi hoti he
 In such a situation, they had longer reaction time than Pune
 yah kaich australian ballebaaj steve okiphi tha, jise unhone aage kii ore dive lagaakar lapka tha
 Saha now aspires to play against Adam Gilchrist of Australia, although Gilchrist has now retired
 aise main saaha ko unke khilaaf khilne kaa mauka ipel main hi mil saktaa he
 Saha also said, "I have played with him in the IPL
 agar unke khilaaf khilne kaa mauka mili to yah shandaar anubhav hoga
 " vastav main jab emes dhoni ne test cricket se sanyas liya tha, to chayankartaaon ko unke sthaan par ek aise khilaadi kii talash thi, jo wicket ke peeche or aage donon jagah kamaal dikhaa sake, kyonki dhoni jaise khilaadi kii jagah bharna aasaan nahin tha

 agar unke khilaaf khilne kaa mauka mili to yah shandaar anubhav hoga
 " australia ke khilaaf unhone do maichon main do world class kaich pakade hai, jo phans ke liye avismaraneey ban gaye hai
 However, when Saha was asked which catch was of the highest order for him, he said that he felt that the catch taken during the Pune Test match was more difficult than the catch in Bangalore
 vaise dekha jaae, to saaha kii pasand sahi bhi najar aati he, kyonki pune test main unhone jo kaich pakadaa tha, usamen riection time bahut kam tha, vah bhi gendbaaji par tej gendbaaj the
 He caught this catch off the bowling of fast bowler Umesh Yadav, which was of Matthew Wade
 umesh kii gend leg said main vade ke balle kaa kinaaraa chhukar peeche gai or saaha ne usko dahini ore dive lagaate hue lapka tha
 The comments bengaluru test kii baat karen to saaha ne yah kaich spin gendbaaj ravichandran aswin kii gend par lapka tha
 Since the spinner has a slower ball
 aise main unke paas riection samay pune kii tulana main zyada tha
 The catch was Australian batsman Steve o'keefe, who he caught by diving forward
 saaha ab australia ke adam gilcrist ke khilaaf khilne kii ichha rakhte hai, haalanki gilcrist ab sanyas le chuke hai
 In such a situation, Saha can only get a chance to play against him in the IPL
 saaha ne kaha bhi he, "main ipel main unke saath khel chukaa hum
 It would be a great experience if i get a chance to play against him
 " By the way, Saha's choice seems right, because the catch time he caught in the Pune Test, the reaction time was very short, he was also a fast bowler on the bowling
