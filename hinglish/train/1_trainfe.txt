 pradhanmantri manmohan singh na keval ek behtareen mauka chook gaye balki media kaa uphaas bhi kar gaye jo karpshan or mahangaai kaa mudda lagaataar uthaa rahaa tha
 In his last press conference, Manmohan Singh could elaborate on some issues, give his exploration on many issues and tell many new things
 lekin unhone apni aadat ke mutabik aisa kuch bhi nahin kiya
 He praised Rahul Gandhi in open words but did not throw any light on whether he would be the next Prime Ministerial candidate
 ek taraf to unhone mana ki sarkaar mahangaai rokane main naakaam rahi to saath main yah bhi kah diya ki yah khaane-pine kii vastuon kii mahangaai thi or sarkaar ne kamazor varg ke logon ke haathon main pehle se zyada paisa dilvaaya
 Regarding corruption, he said that his government is committed to ending corruption
 lekin yah us pradhanmantri kaa bayaan nahin hona chahie tha jiske kaarykaal main sabase zyada karpshan ke maamle uthe or sarkaar chaaron ore se ghiri rahi
 Accusing the opposition of not running Parliament, he went on to accuse him of not making laws against corruption but did not say anything special on that issue
 yah aisa mudda tha jis par pradhanmantri bol sakate the or joardaar shabdon main apni baat rakh sakate the
 He could not speak in the noise in Parliament but at least he could speak in the press conference
 ve bataa sakate the ki ve koun si paristhitiyaan thim jinhone unhen karpshan ke khilaaf kadam uthaane se roke rakhaa
 But nothing like this happened
 aap kah sakate hai ki manmohan singh ek kor politician nahin hai ve iconomist hai lekin ek arthshaastri hone ke naate ve is baat kii vyakhya to kar hi sakate the ki aakhir ve koun se kaaran the jinke chalate ve arthvyavastha ko itnaa dhakka pahunchaa ki vikaas kii dar nau pratishat ke ausat se girakar paanch par ja pahunchi
 Just by saying that economies keep fluctuating, they cannot shed their pall
 bijnes chambers or kaarobaari yah maanate hai ki sarkaar kii policy paralisis ke kaaran hi arthvyavastha kii yah durdasha hui
 Due to this, projects worth millions of crores of rupees are hanging today
 dilachasp baat yah he ki pradhanmantri ne krishi kshetra main hui pragati ko bhi apni uplabdhiyon main ginava diya jabaki sabhi jaanate hai ki pichley kuch varshon se bharat par monsoon meharbaan rahaa he or anaajon kaa record utpaadan hua
 How can the government tap its back for this? Now Manmohan Singh will be remembered as the Prime Minister of this country who did not speak at the right time and when he said that he did not say anything

 Bollywood's famous item girl Rakhi Sawant always gives a bewildering reply to all those people who consider girls as items
 hamaare samaaj kii dikkat yah he ki ham kisi bhi pratibha kaa sammaan samay par nahin karte hai
 People have not yet recognized the great contribution of Rakhi Sawant
 aaj pahchaan lijie, ye hai maanavtaa par raakhi saavant ke 5 mahaan yogadan
 
 
 Towards the Lauto traditions: While our society is ready to lift the 'west' of the West, Rakhi revives the glorious Indian tradition
 raakhi ne sadiyon pehle khatm ho chuki swanivaraki parampara shuru kii
 This message reached more and more people, so Rakhi broadcast it on national television
 samaaj ko badalo:kehete hai ki gandagi saaf karne ke liye khud jhaadu uthaani padati he
 However, ever since Kejriwal has risen in politics, the demand to ban this idiom is also being raised
 raakhi raajnneeti se khush nahin thi to unhone apni party banaai or chunaav main utrin
 The Indian voter confiscated Rakhi's bail while committing the crime-e-azim
 raakhi ko utane vot bhi nahin mili jitne ek colony main log rahete hai
 The good of the poor: People talk about the backward but do not share their happiness and sorrow
 raakhi se ek garib shaks abhishek kaa dukh nahin dekha gaya
 Now that the boy was young, she could not adopt him, so Rakhi made Abhishek her boyfriend, making the best sacrifice in history
 haalanki kehete hai bandar ko adarak kaa swaad nahin jamata, aisa hi kuch in janaab ke saath bhi hua
 Rakhi sandalwood to Abhishek with a lot of effort
 nae jamaane kii menka:puraane jamaane main bhartiya saundarya kii mahima kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaie ki vishwamitra jaise prakand brahmacharee tak kii tapasya menka ne bhang kar di
 After this, during the fairness cream era, the Indian woman was surrounded by inferiority
 raakhi ne apane damakate aatmavishvaaska parichay diya or baba ramdev ko khuleam ched diya
 Ramdev, however, sent Balakrishna several times that the twinkling eyes do not have a connection with health, but Rakhi does what she wants
 khubsuurati sarjak nahin sarjan ke haathon main he:bharat main log bhagyavaadee bahut hai
 In this round, all the thugs are being cut off in the country
 vigyaan ke is daur main raakhi ne vaigyanik soch kaa jo mujahiraa kiya he uskaa koi sani nahin he
 Earlier people used to get satisfied with whatever God gave to them
 raakhi ne vigyaan kaa sahaara liya
 The parts in the body that were not liked got them replaced
 kamasutra hi meraa matlab he kaam hi raakhi ke jivan kaa ek maatr sutara he

 Xi Jinping has become China's strongest leader after being elected for the next five-year term
 ab vah agle saal 2022 tak china ke raashtrapati bane rahenge
 Not only this, he will remain in power in China even after 2022
 isaki vajah paulitte beuro main zyada umr daraaj logon ko chunaa janaa he
 It is considered the masterstroke of Xi Jinping's staying in power
 china kii communist party (CPC) kii paanch saal main hone vaali party congress main nae netritv kaa chunaav kiya gaya
 In this, members of the Politburo including the head of the party are elected

 At the same time, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang managed to save his seat in the seven-member committee
 paulitte beuro ke paanch sadsy bhi chune gay hai
 They will run: One thing is clear from the age of the members of the Politburo elected in the Chinese government CPC conference that none of these leaders will succeed Xi Jinping
 shi jinping or lee kechiang (62) ke alaava sattarudh parishad main lee jhanshu (67), uppradhanmantri wang yang (62), communist party ke pramukh siddhantkaar wang haning (62), party ke sanghathan vibhaag ke pramukh jhaao leji (60) or shanghai party pramukh haan jhong (63) jagah mili he
 During the meeting, these new comrades completed the age of 68 and replaced the retired members
 saal 2022 ke baad bhi satta main bane rahenge shi jinpingamtaur par is paulitte beuro ke sadasyon main se hi koi ek raashtrapati kaa uttaradhikari banataa he
 However, none of these will become a succession of Xi Jinping
 isaki vajah yah he ki paulitte beuro ke nae sadasyon kii umr itani zyada he ki ve saal 2022 main hone vaale party sammelan main shi jinping kaa uttaradhikari nahin ban paaenge yani yah saaf he ki saal 2022 main shi jinping kaa doosraa kaarykaal samaapt ho jayega, lekin uske baad bhi vah satta main bane rahenge
 After the National Congress of the party, Xi Jinping did address the election of politically elected members after the Communist Party's National Congress to be held in China in five years

 chini raashtrapati ne saal 2020 tak garibi khatm karne kaa kiya vaadashi jinping ne kaha ki dashakon kaa kathin parishram or chini samaajwaad naye yug main pravesh kar chukaa he
 Now we should get new achievements
 is dauraan shi jinping ne saal 2020 tak garibi ko khatm karne or aadhunik samrudh samaaj banane kii baat kahi
 He said that we will make efforts for sustainable and healthy economic development, which will benefit China and the world
 unhone kaha ki party kisi bhi keemat par apane vikaas ke kadam ko nahin rokegi
 The constitution will be included in Xi Jinping's five-year Conclave, the most important thing about this Congress is that the CPC approved the inclusion of Xi Jinping's ideology in its constitution on Tuesday, the last day of the conference
 maaloom ho ki abhi tak party ke samvidhan main sirf maotse tung or unke uradhikari deng shiyoping kii vichaardhaara shaamil he
 Deng's ideas were posthumously incorporated into the party constitution
 shi jinping ke vichaaron ke samvidhan main shaamil hone se yah baat saaf ho gai ki maao ke baad shi jinping china ke sabase shaktishaalee shaks ban gaye hai

 com / ucciypqnmt a fierce confrontation has begun between the BJP and the Election Commission in Benares ahead of the all-phase polling to be held on May 12
 varanasi ke beniabag main narendra modi kii raily ko manjuuri na die jane se naaraaz bijepi ne riterning afasar ko hataane kii maang karte hue aaj biechayu get par satyagrah kaa elaan kar diya he
 bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi, who came to file a letter from Kashi on 24 April on 'ganga ki Pukar', would not have thought that the next time he reached Banaras, a big struggle would have started
 12 may ke chunaav se pehle aaj modi apane loksabhaa kshetra varanasi aa rahe hai
 But before falling to the ground here, the entire battle has started in Kurukshetra of Kashi
 bijepi ke bade netaa modi ke prachaar kii jagah satyagrah kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 The political struggle of Kashi became hot and fast on Wednesday when the Varanasi Collector refused to approve Modi's programs in the city for security reasons
 bijepi netaa arun jetali ke mutabik paanch april ko hi party ne modi ke in kaaryakramon kii manjuuri ke liye aavedan kar diya tha
 But it is alleged that the District Magistrate kept sitting on the bjp's application after hitting the horoscope
 baad main jab bavaal badha, to der raat jiladhikari ne beniabag kii raily ko chhodkar baaki kaaryakramon ko hari jhandi de di
 But, according to the BJP, till then it had enough time to do these programs
 lihaaja party ne khud apane str par modi ke tamaam kaaryakramon ko radd kar diya
 Now Modi will only rally in Rohania today, which was approved earlier
 nirvachan adhikari ko hataane kii maangabijepi ne iske saath hi varanasi ke nirvachan adhikari tathaa jila magistrate pranjal yadav ko tatkaal hataae jane kii maang kii he, jinhone der raat kaha ki unhone bijepi dwaara maangi gai paanch kaaryakramon kii anumati main se chaar ke liye ijaajat di thi
 However, the party denied the move and said that this permission has been given too late
 beniabag main bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ko raily kii ijaajat nahin die jane ko lekar jahaan bijepi ne ayog par hamalaa bolaa he, vahiin congress ke sutron kaa kahana he ki rahul gandhi modi kii somvaar ko amethi main yojit raily ke jawaab main yahaan das may ko ek road sho karenge
 The application has been submitted to the election administration for the road show
 bijepi ne chunaav ayog par mookadarshak bane rahane or modi ko raily yojit karne kii manjuuri nahin dene sambandhi chunaav adhikari kii bhoomika par ‘kaaphi pakshpatpurna’ hone kaa aarope lagaaya
 The Returning Officer cited intelligence reports of possible communal tension for this action
 bheedbhad vaale beniabag ilaake main jahaan bijepi ne raily kii anumati maangi thi, vahaan sampradayik tanaav kaa ricard rahaa he or kanoon vyavastha sambandhi ghatnaayen hone kii ashanka rahi he
 The BJP was stressing that it would organize a rally at this place, not anywhere else
 dharna par baithenge party ke diggajavaranasi ke chunaav adhikari pranjal yadav ko tatkaal hathaaye jane kii maang karte hue bijepi ke varisht netaa arun jetali ne kaha ki ve, amit shah or anya netaa banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay ke baahar or dilli main chunaav ayog ke baahar dharna denge
 Jaitley has written three lengthy letters to the Election Commission asking if the Election Commission is silently accepting the conduct of the Election Officer
 apane chauthe patr main jetali ne elaan kiya ki party shahar ke bahari ilaake rohaniya main raily ke baad mukhya karyaalay main modi ke daure ke alaava mandiron ke shahar main unke guuruuvaar ke sabhi kaarykram radd kar die gaye hai
 He said, 'in these circumstances BJP will not organize any of the three programs in Varanasi
 ’bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke liye kshetra main deraa daale jetali ne teen sadasyeey chunaav ayog par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, ‘jab kamjor log ucch padon par hon, tab loktantr khatre main aa jaataa he
 Jaitley said, "if Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal can do road shows and worship in Varanasi, our candidate is being denied permission to rally
" ’bahut der se di gai ijaajat: bijepibijepi or chunaav ayog ke bich is 'jang' ke bich varanasi jila prashasan ne der raat modi ke chaar kaaryakramon ko anumati de di, lekin bijepi ne ise thukaraate hue kaha ki anumati bahut der se di gai he
 After the controversy, BJP said that it was forced to cancel Modi's rally and Ganga Aarti due to 'prejudicial' conduct of district administration
 baharhaal, chunaav adhikari ne kaha ki bijepi ke ek netaa ke aavedan ke aadhaar par modi ko vaikalpik sthaan par raily yojit karne kii anumati di gai he
 He said that meetings with intellectuals and other programs of Modi including Ganga Pujan have been approved
 unhone kaha, ‘ve jaanboojhkar ise mudda bana rahe hai
 On May 12, in Varanasi, as the turnout for the election stirred up, the BJP alleged that the party was forced to cancel the rally due to the biased conduct of the election officer from the Varanasi Lok Sabha seat
 modi ab rohaniya kshetra main raily ke baad motor kafile main shahar se guzrenge, jabaki arun jetali va amit shah biechayu ke saamne lanka get par dharne par baithenge
 Modi will go to the party's election office in Sigra region via the city and then leave for the airport
 bijepi upaadhyaksh mukhtaar abbaas nakvi or hasharvardhan chunaav ayog ke saamne dharne par baithenge

 More soldiers of both India and Pakistan have not died here due to mutual fighting, more soldiers have died here due to lack of oxygen and avalanche
 yahaan zyaadaatar samay shunya se bhi 50 degree neeche taapmaana rahata he
 According to an estimate, till now 2500 soldiers have lost their lives here, including both the countries

 In Siachen, both India and Pakistan do not remove their jawans
 kyonki yah kshetra ranneetik taur par behad samvedansheel he
 The worst enemy for the soldiers here is the dangerous weather
 jaaniye kya he siachin vivaad or yah kshetra bharat ke liye kyon he mahatvapurn
 
 
 Jansiyachin was made a military base in 1984 due to the bad weather of 869 soldiers since 1984
 tab se lekar 2015 tak 869 sainik sirf kharaab mausam ke kaaran apni jaan ganvaa chuke hai
 Siachen is one of the few areas in the country where it is not easily accessible nor is it easy for everyone to go to this world's highest battle ground
 har din javaanon par 5 karod ru
 The Indian government spends 5 crore rupees every day from India to protect the soldiers present in Siachen
 yahaan mausam itnaa kharaab rahata he ki sirf gan shot fire karne yaa metal kaa kuch bhi chune se thand se akad sakati hai yani frost bite tak ho sakati he
 There is difficulty in seeing and hearing when living for a long time
 yaaddashat kamjor hone lagati he
 Fingers are melted

 3 thousand soldiers are always stationed 3 thousand soldiers are always deployed to protect the Indian border on the Asia Glacier
 pakistan siachin par hameshaa se apana daawa karte aayaa he, haalanki paak ko sateek jawaab miltaa rahata he
 Can a normal person go to Siachen? In Siachen, the mercury goes up to -60 degrees during winter
 garmiyon main taapmaana -30 degree tak rahata he
 Common people are allowed to reach Panamik village only
 ye ek chota sa gaanv he jahaan ke garm pani ke strot ise aakarshan kaa centre banaate hai
 However, Siachen's annual civilian trek is organized by the Indian Army
 ye iklauta mauka hota he jab aam insaan siachin ja sakate hai
 The army carries 40 people
 It consists of two journalists, defense scientists, school cadets and some civilians
 2007 main is tarah ke trek kii shuruyaat hui thi
 This track shows the strengths of the Indian Army
 The track provides evidence that India can defend its border at any height
 jo 40 log chune jate hai pehle unka medical chekup hota he, jo anfit hote hai unhen waapas bhej diya jaataa he
 Then two days are given just for adjusting with air and temperature
 iske baad 8 din kii training hoti he siachin battle skool main
 This is where soldiers are trained so that they can save their lives on the glacier
 yahaan trek main chune gaye logon ko 8 din kii training di jaati he or iske baad phir se medical chekup hota he
 This checkup tells whether people will go ahead or not
 isamen se bhi kai anfit qaraar de die jate hai
 The Indian Army conducts trekking of 16 thousand feet
 The Indian Army takes the common people on the track to the Kumar post at 16 thousand feet

 After this, trekkers reach 14 km by walking 14 km

 Then, after walking 16 km from here, you will reach r Camp-3 and then 18 km and reach Kumar post
 trek par jane se pehle hoti he opi baba kii poojasiachin main 80 ke dashak main opi naam kaa ek sainik laapata ho gaya tha
 Since then, it is believed that Siachen soldiers are protected by OP Baba
 yahaan tak ki koi bhi sainik opi baba ko pranaam kiye bina aage nahin badhata
 This 60 km track ends in 4 days
 20 hazaar feet kii unchai par jaakar samaj aata he ki hamaare sainik kis tarah kii museebaton kaa saamana karte hai
 Why is it important to maintain Siachen? Siachen glacier is located in the Karakoram range
 himalay kii ye jagah bharat, china or pakistan ke bich ek tribhuj ke aakaar main he
 Part of Pakistan is very less
 siachin bharat ke liye kaaphi jaruri he kyonki
 
 
 Siachen is the only Indian source where such a large amount of potable water is available
 yahaan se nubra nadi nikalati he
 It goes further and joins the Indus River
 ye pakistan ke punjab praant kaa sabase bada pani kaa strot he
 Getting control over this means that Pakistan can be compromised on the strength of this water
 sabase ahm baat ye he ki ye kashmir kaa entry point sabit ho saktaa he
 People from both China and Pakistan can enter Kashmir with the help of Siachen
 bharat kaa tourism bhi leh ladakh se lekar khardungla paas tak he jo nubra ghati se 120 kilometre dur he
 Siachen Controversy: In 1984, India occupied the glacier at a height of 16-18 thousand feet above the sea level, on one side of the Siachen glacier, the border of Pakistan
 duusari taraf china kii seemaa aksai china is ilaake main he
 This area is very important for India by keeping an eye on both the countries
 1972 ke shimla samjhaute main is ilaake ko bejaan or banjar qaraar diya gaya yani yah ilaaka insaanon ke rahane ke laayak nahin he
 The agreement did not state where the border between India and Pakistan would be in Siachen
 uske baad se is kshetra par pakistan ne apana adhikaar jataana shuru kar diya
 The upper part of this glacier is currently occupied by India and the lower part by Pakistan
 1984 main pakistan siachin par kabje kii taiyaari main tha lekin sahi samay par isaki jaankaree hone ke baad sena ne oparation meghdoot launch kiya
 Siachen glacier was captured by India on 13 April 1984
 isse pehle is kshetra main sirf parvatarohi aate the
 Now, no one other than the army was allowed to come here
 2003 main bharat or pakistan ke bich yudhviram sandhi ho gai
 Since that time, firing and shelling has stopped in this area

 Adrian Barath (62) and Craig Braithwaite (68) gave the West Indies a good start by adding 137 runs for the first wicket
 in donon ke 13 ran ke andar pavilion lautne ke baad kirk edwards (naabad 65) or derren braavo (naabad 57) ne salaami jodi ke prayaason ko bakhubi aage badhaayaa

 India's decision to keep out fast bowler Umesh Yadav, who took nine wickets in the last match, did not prove to be right
 unki jagah varun aaron ko apana pehla test khilne kaa mauka diya gaya
 He did bother the batsmen slightly on the balls going out of the stumps at a speed of 140 kmph on two occasions, but he is still waiting for his first Test wicket

 haalanki donon hi ise shatak main tabdeel karne main naakaam rahe
 After this, Ashwin also harassed Barath after this

 Edwards initially showed momentum and completed his half-century with the help of eight fours
 braavo jeevandaan milane ke baad ishanth kii gend par chaukaa jadkar 50 ran ke paar pahunche
 India took the new ball in the 85th over but it also had no effect on the Caribbean batsmen

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) India has been projected as a young country for the last several years, but there is also a fact that the population of the elderly in India is growing faster than expected
 yah 2050 tak badhkar 34 karod pahunchane kii sambhaavna he jo sanyukt raashtra ke 31
 68 crores is more than the estimate
 saath hi yah ek spasht sanket he ki bharat anumaan se adhik teji sebudhaho rahaa he
 These estimates have raised a very important question for the health sector whether we are ready to provide quality medical care and proper care to the fast growing elderly population
 Let us know, increasing age affects not only physical, but also mental health 
 isliye videshon kii tarj par edlt care va homecare concept bharat main teji se lokapriy ho rahaa he
 Under this, along with treatment and health care of the elderly, their loneliness can also be removed
 health export kaa maananaa he ki bujurgon main akelapavsaadka sabase bada kaaran he
 Currently, every other youth is moving to other cities or abroad for jobs, leaving their old parents alone
 kai baar jab mata-pita apane bacchon ke saath kahin baahar jate hai to ve ajanabi maahaul main khud ko dhaal nahin pate hai, aise main un bujurgon ke liye edlt care sevaayen acha vikalp hai
 Deprivation among the elderly has presented itself as an emerging health challenge for India
 vibhinn reporton ke mutabik, bharat main bujurgo main avsaad kaa ausat pratishat 16 he jo vishwa ke chaar pratishat ke ausat se bahut adhik he
 The Health Expert (WHO) cited the report as saying, "depressed people above the age of 55 are four times more likely to die of brain trauma or stroke than other normal people
" home care sarvice ko bhartiya swasthya seva kshetra kaa ek aavashyak hissaa banaae jane kii jarurat he, taaki bujurgon kii bimariyon se nipta ja sake
 What are these services and how do they work? In fact, homecare and adult care services are becoming very popular for the care of the elderly as well as abroad
 iske tahat desh ke bade hospital or chikitsa centre prashikshit logon ke jariye bujurgon kii counselling ke saath samaaj main unhen mail-jol badhaane ke liye prerit kiya jaataa he
 Senior Psychiatrist of World Brain Center Hospital, Janakpuri, Dr
 neelesh tiwari ne bataaya, vruddh logon main avsaad maansik rogon ke sabase aam kaarnon main se ek he
 Apart from biological and psychological factors, environment is also an important cause of depression
 jab log akele rahete hai or saamaajik rup se sakriy nahin hote hai to unamem nakaaratmakataa ghar kar jaati he or dhire-dhire unka swasthya kharaab hota jaataa he
 Older people, in particular, should stay away from loneliness and try to expand their scope of harmony
 chikatsiya seva pradaata iviech senior care ke prabandhak swadip shrivastav kehete hai, akelaapan, avsaad or akaal mrityu kaaphi had tak aapas main jude hote hai
 There are many options and services coming out of this problem
 jo log apane kariyar or vyaktigat patibaddhtaon ke kaaran apane maa-baap ko samay nahin de paa rahe hai, ve in sevaaon ke jariye apane abhibhavakon ko na keval swasth, balki khush bhi rakh sakate hai
 He said, not only this, people trained to help the elderly take them on a walk, read books and talk to them
 chunki yah kaam chikitsa kshetra main prashikshit hue log karte hai, isliye iskaa bujurgon par kaaphi acha prabhaav padataa he or unka shaareerik va maansik swasthya bhi acha rahata he

 baba ramdev kii aalochanaon ko khaarij karte hue hazaare ne kaha ki vah yogaguru se baatcheet karenge kyonki is samay bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai main desh ko ekasaath aage le janaa mahatvapurn he
 Asked why former IPS officer Kiran Bedi was not included in the committee, the 73-year-old Gandhian activist said that i would request Baba Ramdev not to consider it that way
 ham sabhi milakar is desh ko aage le jaayenge
 He also has a love for the country
 main unase kahuunga ki kisi vyakti vishesh ke bare main nahin sochen or sirf desh ko dhyaan main rakhen
 Hazare said that i would request him
 main unke charan sparsh kar kahuunga ki hamen desh ke liye yah karnaa he
 It is important to have an understanding of law in order to draft
 iske liye visheshgyon kii jarurat he
 The committee is only for two months
 andolan se jude mukhya kaaryakarta arvind kejariwal ko bhi samiti kaa sadsy namit kiya he
 Kiran Bedi said that the issue is not about any person, but we want a strong bill prepared
 bhartiya rajasav seva adhikari rahe kejariwal ne shanivaar raat kaha tha ki unhone ramdev se baat kii thi or galatfahami dur ho chuki he
 Kiran is requesting the media to give the same coverage to Hazare's campaign as was given to the Cricket World Cup
 unhone kaha ki vah samiti kaa hissaa bilkul nahin hona chaahati thim
 She wants the experts to do their work
 unhone kaha ki yah e-plus team he
 Only those who are knowledgeable about the functioning of the government can be a part of the committee and who can help in enacting a law that takes care of all aspects of fighting corruption on a large scale
 hazaare ne kaha ki unhone samiti main shaamil hone se shuruyaat main inkaar kar diya tha
 He said that who will remain in the committee and who will not, it is not important
 jane maane vakil shanti bhushan ne kaha ki unke putr prashanth ne khud hi ham donon ke ek hi samiti main hone kaa mudda uthaaya tha lekin unhone kaha ki hazaare ne hi kaha he ki is samiti main visheshgyon kaa hona jaruri he

 yojana ke bare main alvar ke ek kisaan bhajan yadav kehete hai, 'kya acchhee he, paise dene kii yojana
 Quit wages and keep circling the bank for money
 wo bhi milti nahi
 We have no use vahiin kisaan shriram yadav kii shikaayat he ki pehali baar paise die the
 Never received money after that
 unka kahana he, 'hamane bank main khate bhi khulavaa liye lekin aaj din tak paise nahin aae
 According to government data, in the first quarter, all 13,458 consumers had given money in the account, but in the second quarter only 7415 and in the third quarter 3164 consumers deposited the money in the account
 prashasan kaa kahana he ki jin logon ne die gaye paise se kerosine nahin kharida unka paisa band kar diya gaya he
 Alwar's logistics officer Ramchandra Meena says that we have stopped the money of those who did not buy kerosene from the money given
 sawaal uthta he ki agar kisi maheene main koi kisi vajah se kerosine nahin le paae to kya uskaa naam garibi list se kaat dena uchit he
 After this scheme kerosene consumption has come down by 70 percent but the price of kerosene has also come down to Rs 50 per liter
 jinhen khareednaa he wo log is badi keemat ke liye sarkaar ko doshi maan rahe hai

 Apart from this, people like Sardar Patel, Swami Vivekananda, Subhash Chandra Bose, who were lost in the secular world, suddenly started appearing on the Congress Twitter account
 kya yah raajnneeti kaa badla cheharaa he yaa congress or samaajawaadee party jaise dalon ko bhi ab ahsaas ho gaya he ki unke ‘secularvaad’ ke sanvaidhanik naare ko narendra modi kii buland aawaaj ne bade aaraam se ‘muslim tushtikaran’ ke paryaay ke taur par janamanas main sthapit kar diya he
 Now it is the responsibility of these parties to re-establish themselves as the party of the masses
 lekin jis tarah se palada ek taraf jhuk gaya he usko santulit karne ke liye in partiyon ko thodaa hinduvadi yaa karmkandi hindu dikhne kii jarurat pad rahi he
 The definition of Secular Hindutva begins with 'secular Hindutva' at the point of imbalance
 secular hindutv kaa matlab hua ki netaa apane rang-dhang se yah dikhaane kii koshish karata rahegaa ki vah puri tarah hindu he, bas vah kisi alpsankhyak samudaay kaa dushman nahin he
 He is not an enemy of Muslims, but should not be regarded as a Muslim preacher
 darasal, yahi vah aghoshit parampara he jis par desh mahatma gandhi ke udai ke baad se hi chalata rahaa he
 Minorities are the most safe in this tradition
 jaraa yaad kiijie ki mahatma gandhi ne khud ko vaishnav jan maanane main, haath main gita lene main or ishwar par atoot vishwaas jaahir karne main kabhi gurej nahin kiya
 Bapu always used the concept of sin and virtue not included in the mold of modern secularism as his political weapon
 khud ko puure desh kaa netaa banane se pehle unhone khud ko hinduon kaa netaa banane diya
 If it was not so, they would not have needed to join the Khilafat movement separately to connect the Muslims
 aage padhein, jab gandhiji ne kaha- pakistan naa maangegandhi ji kii yahi pravriti aath-nau agast 1942 ko bombai main hue congress ke sammelan main saaf dikhi
 In the speech giving historical slogan of the Quit India Movement, or in the history that has created history, the Father of the Nation has repeatedly asked the Muslims to demand what they want from the Hindus right now (from Gandhiji), he is ready to accept all the demands
 Are, but do not demand Pakistan
 baapu ne saath hi yah joda kii maang insaaniyat ke khilaaf nahin honi chahie
 That is, Gandhiji managed to make his acceptance in the Hindu society before he became the leader of the country and the world
 or unki isi kamyaabi ne bharat main rah gaye musalamaanon ke man main unhen apane rahabar ke taur par bane rahane kaa mauka diya
 Nehru followed the tradition, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru followed this tradition at all costs, despite the intense communal atmosphere of the time of independence
 isi parampara ke kattar nirvaah kaa hi kaaran tha ki desh kaa aam hindu nehru ko hi apana netaa maanata rahaa or alpsankhyakon ko bhi unheen ke haathon main apni suraksha mahasoos hui
 But remember that Ramlala was seated at the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya while he was the Prime Minister of Pandit Nehru and the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh of Pandit Govind Vallabh Pant
 lakh khilaaf hote hue bhi nehru murtiyon hatwane kaa sakht faisla nahin le paae
 This was the inevitable drawback of secular Hindutva, because if the idols were removed, then it would be easy for the hardline Hindutva to convince the Congress to be anti-hindu
 iske alaava har pratishthan kaa naam sanskrit main rakhana or har sarkari kaarykram main deep prajjvalan or nariyal phodne jaisi paramparaon ko nehru ne khud bhi nibhaayaa
 The minority society never objected to this open but fine adulteration of secularism of Hindu traditions
 is tarah yah secular hindutv chalata rahaa
 Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and Narasimha Rao all walked quietly on this line
 haalanki narsimha raav secular hindutv ke kathin anushaasan ko saadh nahin sake or ayodhya main babari masjid kaa dhwans ho gaya
 Then remember

 Not even leaving his government (22 February 2016) After the Jat agitation in Haryana, a new challenge was posed to the party by a statement by Anil Vij
 anil vij ne dhamkee bhare andaaj main kaha tha ki jat aarakshan hinsa main mare logon ko agar muaavja diya gaya to vah istipha de denge
 Haryana Health and Sports Minister Anil Vij, known for his outspoken views, was angry with OP Dhankad's tweet, in which compensation of 10 lakh rupees to each person who died in violence and a government job to a member of his household

 vij ne fatehabad kii police adheekshak ipies sangeeta kaaliya se baithak se nikal jane ke liye kaha
 Vij leaves the meeting angrily after Sangeeta refuses
 jab vij ne sangeeta se kaha 'get out', tab sangeeta ne kaha, 'main nahin jaaoongi

 Two of his wives and four children have been taken into custody after Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden was killed in an American campaign
 sthaneey media reporto main bataaya gaya he ki do mahilaon tathaa chaar bacchon ko parisar se baahar le jaaya gaya he
 He is said to be Laden's wife and child
 haalanki abhi yah nahin pataa chalaa he ki ve is samay kiski hiraasat main hai
 The US Navy's campaign today culminated in the killing of Laden, one of his sons, two suspected messengers and a woman he used as a shield in Abbottabad, Pakistan
 pakistani sainikon ne us parisar ko gher liya jahaan laden ko maaraa gaya or uski ore jane vaale sabhi margo ko sil kar diya gaya

 upi main bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar or gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kii agali raily varanasi main 20 disambar ko hogi
 This rally is important in the sense that by the time this rally is held, the election results of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Delhi and Chhattisgarh would have been reached
 yani kaashi main modi ke paas chunaav nateezon ke aadhaar par tevar dikhaane kaa mauka hoga
 It is likely that Modi will have new arguments and grounds to respond to his opponents
 saath hi unke saamne yah asamanjas bhi nahin hoga ki agar munh se kuch nikal jaae to vah padosi rajyon main chunavi abhiyaan ko nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 In such a situation, the Kashi rally will be the real beginning of Modi's Lok Sabha election campaign in UP
 ab tak upi main bhagava agenda se bana rakhi he duriupi main modi kii yah 5veen raily kaashi main sangh parivaar ke agenda ke hisse vaali jameen hone ke kaaran anya reliyon se hatakar hogi
 Significantly, in the 90s, the slogan of the salvation of Vishwanath temple of Kashi used to run in the body of people like the salvation of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi temple
 isliye logon kii yah jigyaasa swaabhaavik he ki modi kaashi main pichhali reliyon jaisi hi bhashaa bolte hai yaa unke tevar kuch bhagava rang vaale rahenge
 However, Modi has so far appeared far from the saffron agenda in Uttar Pradesh
 baat baharich raily kii ho yaa agra kii
 His rally is about a hundred km from Ayodhya
 dur baharich main to mathura se lagbhag 60 kimi
 Away took place in Agra
 lekin ab 20 disambar ko vijay shankhanaad raily kaashi main hone ja rahi he
 From here, Modi can make bjp's election campaign very aggressive by exposing the real elements of Lok Sabha elections

 The Allahabad High Court reduced the death sentence of 2006 Nithari case convict Surender Koli to life imprisonment on the basis of 'excessive delay' in deciding mercy petition

 netahnaan indian bridal mechap karte huemessop karte hue netahnanmodel ke saath natthananbaccom kaa mechap karte hue Natthanan Mohammad Aamir Khan fought a long battle for 14 years
 unki ye ladaai aasaan nahin thi
 The forehead was labeled as a terrorist, but the hope of freshness and justice never allowed Aamir to break up, and was acquitted of the charge
 darasal is cese ab mohammad aamir ko dilli police kii taraf se 5 lakh rupee kaa muaavja diya gaya he
 This is the first time in such a case that the Delhi Police has to pay compensation
 NHRC ke aadesh par amalamir ko insaaf dilaane ke pichherashtriya maanavadhikaar ayogki bhi badi bhoomika rahi
 The compensation to Aamir has been given on the order of NHRC
 ayog ne media main chal raheen khabaron kaa sangyaan lete hue grih mantralay or dilli sarkaar ko 4 disambar 2015 ko notice jari kar muaavja dene kaa aadesh diya tha
 Not only this, the NHRC had also issued summons to the Chief Secretary of Delhi and the Chief of Delhi Police in January 2018 regarding the delay in compensation
 gauratlab he ki dilli police ne aamir ko disambar 1997 koatankwaadi gatividhiyonmen shaamil hone ke aarope main giraftaar kiya tha
 But in January 2012, Aamir was acquitted by the court, terming him innocent
 jab aamir ko giraftaar kiya tha tab uski umr 18 saal thi
 Aamir was charged with 18 cases, including the bomb blast
 muaavje par pratikriya dete hue aamir ne kaha ki uske parivaar ne jobadanamizeli he uski bharpai isse kabhi nahin ho sakati he
 But he fought a long battle for justice and acquitted it is a big victory for him

 Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman of the Aditya Birla Group, said on Friday that the government needs to work beyond the company tax cuts for the economy and provide solid fiscal incentives for the economy
 unhone kaha ki vyapaar main rajkoshiya sujh-boojh honi chahie lekin maujuuda samay main ek aisi rajkoshiya niti kii bhi jarurat he jisase narmi se nipatane main madad mili
 Birla said in a media event, 'I am already saying that i am not an economist but i think we have come close to the abyss
 
 
 abhi arthvyavastha ke liye sarkaar kii taraf se bade str par rojkoshiya protsaahan dene kii jarurat he
 As such, the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM) allows relaxation of the fiscal deficit target by half a percent

 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ko company kar main katautee ke alaava or bahut kuch karne kii jarurat he

 vahiin vinirmaan kshetra kii nai companiyon liye kar kii dar 25 pratishat se ghataakar 15 pratishat kar diya gaya he
 Apart from this, the government has also taken steps to facilitate business and increase foreign direct investment

 This will increase our cash flow
 sarkaar ne kaaphi kuch kiya he
 i do not deny it

 ' sukh-santosh kii devi maa ke pita ganesh or mata riddhi-siddhi hai
 riddhi-siddhi, being a family full of wealth, grain, gold, silver, coral, gems, has also been considered as the goddess of fulfillment, happiness and peace and desires
 sukh-saubhaahgya kii kaamana se mata santoshi ke 16 shuukravaar tak vrath kiye jane kaa vidhaan he
 The mother's fast story is as follows: An old lady
 uskaa ek hi putr tha
 After the marriage of the old son, the daughter-in-law got all the household chores done, but did not give her proper food
 yah sab ladkaa dekhtaa par maa se kuch bhi nahin kah paata
 The daughter-in-law would be busy throughout the day - she would pat, cook the bread, clean utensils, wash clothes and all her time would have passed
 kafisoch-vichaarkarek din ladkaa maa se bolaa- `maa, main pardes ja rahaa hum
 The mother liked the son and gave him permission to leave
 iske baad vah apni patni ke paas jaakar bolaa- `main pardes ja rahaa hum
 Give me some of your signs
 ́ bahu boli- `mere paas to nishaani dene yogya kuch bhi nahin he
 Saying this, she fell at her husband's feet and started crying
 isse pati ke juuton par gobar se sane haathon se chhap ban gai
 The mother-in-law's atrocities continued to grow after her son's death
 ek din bahu du:khee ho mandir chali gai
 There he saw that many women were worshiping
 usne striyon se vrath ke bare main jaankaree lee to ve boleen ki ham santoshi mata kaa vrath kar rahi hai
 It ends all kinds of sufferings
 striyon ne bataaya-shuukravaar ko naha-dhokarek lote main shuddh jal le gud-chane kaa prasad lenaa tathaa sachche man se maa kaa pujan karnaa chahie
 Do not eat nor give it to anyone even after forgetting the sourness
 ek vakt bhojan karnaa
 Hearing the fast, she started fasting on Friday every Friday
 mata kii krupa se kuch dinon ke baad pati kaa patr aayaa
 a few days later money also arrived
 usne prasann man se phir vrath kiya tathaa mandir main ja anya striyon se boli- `santoshi maa kii krupa se hamen pati kaa patr tathaa rupaya aayaa he
 All other women also started fasting with reverence
 bahu ne kaha- `he maa! jab meraa pati ghar aa jayega to main tumhaare vrath kaa udhyapan karuungi
 'now one night Santoshi's mother gave a dream to her husband and said why don't you go to your house? So he started saying - All the goods of Seth have not been sold yet
 rupaya bhi abhi nahin aayaa he
 He told all the dreams to Seth and asked for permission to go home
 par seth ne inkaar kar diya
 By the grace of mother, many traders came, bought gold and silver and other goods
 karjadaar bhi rupaya lautaa gaye
 Now the moneylender allowed him to go home
 ghar aakar putr ne apni maa va patni ko bahut saare rupee die
 The wife said that i have to promote the fast of Santoshi Mata
 usne sabhi ko nyotaa de udhyapan kii sari taiyaari kii
 a woman from the neighborhood started jealous after seeing him happy
 usne apane bacchon ko sikhaa diya ki tum bhojan ke samay khatai jarur maangana
 At the time of industry, children were eating and eating food
 to bahu ne paisa dekar unhen bahalaaya
 Children started eating tamaris and khatis from the shop and started eating
 to bahu par mata ne coup kiya
 The king's messengers took her husband and took her away
 to kisi ne bataaya ki udhyapan main bacchon ne paison kii imali khatai khai he to bahu ne pun: vrath ke udhyapan kaa sankalp kiya
 After the resolution, when she came out of the temple, her husband appeared in the way
 pati bolaa- itnaa dhan jo kamaaya he, uskaa tex raja ne maanga tha
 The following Friday, he again duly promoted the fast
 isse santoshi maa prasann huin
 Noumah later became a beautiful son like Moon
 ab saas, bahu tathaa betaa maa kii krupa se anand se rahane lage
 After Aam Aadmi Party convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, now Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia has targeted the Election Commission

 Manish Sisodia said in a tweet, 'why is this' open challenge' coming to the media instead of being 'leaked' instead of coming out in the open? So far there is no letter from the Election Commission or press release! He has said that when there are reports in the media through the Election Commission that the Election Commission is ready to get its EVM machine tested, then why is it publicly disclosing it
 aakhir media main sutron ke hawaale se khabaren kyon aa rahi hai
 Why not the Election Commission issues a press note
 (emsidi chunaav 2017: iviem par bijepi ne arvind kejariwal ko yaad dilaayaa unka hi twit) Why is this 'open challenge' coming to the media by being 'leaked' instead of coming out in the open? So far there is no letter from the Election Commission or press release! https: / / t

 chunavi nateezon main bijepi ke kamjor hote hi shivasena havishivsena kii najar ab mukhyamantri kii kursi paramaharashtra or haryana main hue vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey lagbhag saaf ho chuke hai
 In Maharashtra, where the bjp-shiv Sena alliance is going to hold power once again, there is a screw in Haryana
 yahaan par kisi bhi party ko bahumat nahin mila he, lekin bijepi sabase badi party banakar saamne aa rahi he
 Haryana needs 46 seats for a majority and BJP has 40 seats
 aise main use jaadui aankade ke liye 6 or vidhayakon kii jarurat he, jise hasil karne main bijepi ko zyada mushkilon kaa saamana nahin karnaa padegaa
 But the BJP may have faced more difficulties in forming the government in Maharashtra than in Haryana
 darasal, haryana main anya ke khate main 10 siten ja rahi hai
 It is being told that out of these 10 mlas, 5 to 6 mlas are BJP rebels who contested independent elections and can support BJP to form the government
 haryana main bijepi ke liye raahat kii baat ye bhi he ki use ek saal puraani party jananaayak janata party (jejepi) kaa saath mil rahaa he
 According to sources, it is reported that Dushyant Chautala's party JJP will support BJP in Haryana
 haalanki bijepi ko isaki jarurat naa pade, kyonki nirdaleey vidhayakon ko mantripad dekar bijepi unka samarthan hasil kar sakati he
 In such a situation, it will not be difficult for the BJP to form a government in Haryana, but in Maharashtra the case is exactly opposite
 shivasena kii najar siem kii kursi paramaharashtra main bijepi aurshivsenagathabandhan ke khate main 158 siten ai hai
 BJP has got 101 seats here and Shiv Sena has 57 seats
 chunavi nateezon main bijepi ke kamjor hote hi shivasena kii nazren ab mukhyamantri kii kursi par he
 In the election campaign, where the BJP used to remind Shiv Sena of its elder brother, the election results will now force the BJP to bow down
 shivasena ab bijepi ke saamne apni sharten rakhegi jiskaa trailor usne ab se kuch der pehle hi dikhaaya
 While giving the press conference on Thursday evening, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray gave 50-50 formula to the BJP
 vahiin mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne kaha ki jo tay hua usee par chalenge
 It is clear from the statement of both the leaders that the fight now is about the Chief Minister's chair
 saaf he ki shivasena ko bijepi par haaavee hone kaa mauka mil gaya he or vah itani aasaani se peeche nahin hatane vaali
 Now everyone will keep an eye on Shiv Sena
 kya vah mukhyamantri pad ke liye fadanvis ke naam par raji hogi yaa kisi or ke naam par
 Shiv Sena's eyes will now also be on the ministerial position
 aise main bijepi ko haryana se zyada maharashtra ke liye maathapai kerani padegi

 Actually, India's defeat in this match has increased a bit for Pakistan
 kyonki agar england yah muqabla haar jaataa to pakistan kaa semifinal khelnaa tay ho saktaa tha
 But now if England lose in the match with New Zealand, then Pakistan will not be able to play the semi-finals as Pakistan's points will be reduced by New Zealand

 unhone kaha, ‘hamaara akraman kaaphi anbhavi he
 The good thing is that all the bowlers in our team are the wicket-takers and the chances of the team in which the wicket-takers are the bowlers increases

 New Zealand have performed well in the ICC tournaments and the performance of the West Indies team cannot be gauged

 co / 5viohlgkvp— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi)march 21, 2017pradhanmantri narendra modi kii kavitaayen ab aap mobile teb or laptop par bhi pard sakenge
 Modi has released his collection of poems 'sakshibhava' as an e-book on World Poetry Day
 ye kavitaayen saalon ke unke sangharsh ke dauraan likhi gai hai
 This is not a monologue but a dialogue like a dialogue with the Supreme Mother Jagatjanani's mother
 apane dukh, khushi, utsaah, aas-niraashaa or man main umadte-ghumdate vichaaron ko maa ke saath saajha karte modi
 There was no Prime Minister then, so he put his ideas in poems more easily
 isamen mul rup se gujarati me likhi gaikavitaayenhain
 Prabhat Prakashan published a collection of pm's poems two years ago
 inkaa anuwaad hindi main kiya gaya
 a collection called 'sakshibhava' came on the market
 ab isaki i-book bhi aa gai he
 When he became a Sangh pracharak in 1986, he showed a lot of optimism about his new responsibility
 'maa, kya main in apekshaaon ko puraa kar sakuunga?kya vastav main jis aashaa aakanksha or vishwaas ke saath mujhe ye kaam saunpa gaya he use puraa kar sakuunga?kathor parishram karkipane aapako iske liye taiyaar kar sakuunga
 
 
 According to Prabhat Kumar, head of Prabhat Publications, PM has given a new honor to Kavita by opening the e-book on World Poetry Day
 ab pathak aaj ke jamaane ke saath narendra bhai kii kavitaaon kaa anand le sakenge
 Will be able to consolidate his ideas with him, because the poems of Narendra Bhai represent sentimental thinking on the common ground
 har vyakti in paristhitiyon main aisa hi sochataa he
 Rama also thinks something similar when the lotus flower falls short in Mahapraan Suryakant Tripathi Nirala's 'ram Shakti Puja'
 yani kaaljayi kavitaayen ab kaaljayi madhyam se pathakon tak pahunch gai hai
 Another poem of the same period

 In my presentation there was also no manifestation of feelings of anguish, compassion, intense desire to face the situation, yearning etc
 'shabd tab bhi yahi the or ab dekho to lagata he kitne sateek the, aaj ke liye bhi
 
 
 'mother, i know that this body has to be taken to a new theater now, it has to be decorated in accordance with the new theater, the mind, intellect, heart - all these parts of the body have to be molded according to this new theater

 Former Union Minister Arun Shourie on Monday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is deliberately keeping silence on events like Dadri incident, while his cabinet and party colleagues have kept the issue alive just to win Bihar elections
 vah is baat se bhi sahamat hue ki modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah bihar main ek samudaay ko duusare ke khilaaf khadaa kar rahe hai
 He referred to a Pakistani analyst in this context, according to which the neighboring country is trying to overcome it while India is moving towards it
 vitt mantri jetali dwaara 2002 se asihashnutaa se modi ke sarvaadhik peedit hone kii baat kahe jane par jetali par hamalaa bolte hue shouri ne kaha ki yah sabase ghatiya bachaav he jo unhone suna he
 Coming out in support of the writers and artists returning the award against the atmosphere of intolerance, he told Karan Thapar on India Today channel that he is the 'sentinel of consciousness' of the country and his motives cannot be questioned
 piem bhargav jaise vaigyanikon or infosis ke sansthaapak enaar narayanamurthi kii saraahna karte hue shouri ne sawaal kiya ki ye log ugr kahe ja sakate hai, jis shabd kaa istemaal jetali ne kiya tha? unhone kaha ki in logon ne desh ke liye apaar yogadan diya or jin logon ne un par prahaar kiya, unhone pichley 20 saal main koi pustak nahin padhi
 'those who cannot write two paragraphs are sitting to judge the writers
 ' Rejecting repeated statements of BJP leaders hoping not to speak to the Prime Minister on any and every issue, Shourie said that he is doing the same and not speaking on the issues on which he should speak
 unhone kaha, 'pradhanmantri homeopathy vibhaag ke section officer nahin hai
 He is not a head of department
 vah pradhanmantri hai
 They have to show moral path to the country
 unhen naitik maandand sthapit karne honge
 ' shouri ne dadri cond ke sheeghra baad kendriya mantri mahesh sharma ke janmdin, james camran ke janmdin, makka main bhagdad or ankara visphot jaise muddon par modi ke twit kaa hawala diya
 The former Union Minister said that but he kept silence over the events like Dadri incident and murder of two Dalit children in Haryana
 vah chuppi saadhe hue hai, jabaki unki party ke sahakarmi or mantri is mudde ko jeevant rakhe hue hai
 Asked if Modi's silence was political, he said, 'I think so
 aap donon raste par nahin chal sakate
 You are a very strong leader, but you cannot control your members
 ' purv raashtrapati abdul kalam par sharma kii vivaadaaspad tippanee kaa zikr karte hue unhone kaha ki kalam jis makaan main rahe the use sharma ko aavantit karnaa 'logon ke munh par thukne jaisaa he
 "it is truly symbolic
" ' ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki iskaa iraadaa kisi bhi keemat par bihar chunaav jeetne kaa he
 The comments unhone kaha ki modi apni chuppi ke parinama ko mahasoos nahin kar rahe or yah aag na sirf unhen balki puure desh ko jala degi
 These issues will strain the social fabric of the country
 shouri ne kaha ki bihar main kota mudde par apane bhaashanon se modi ne khud ko lalu prasad ke str tak neeche laa diya he, jabaki nitish kumaar rajaneta kii tarah dikh rahe hai
 He also dismissed BJP President Amit Shah's statement of firecrackers being burnt in Pakistan after the BJP lost in Bihar, saying things were different now
 is sandarbh main unhone ek pakistani vishleshak kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki pataakhe pehle hi vahaan jalaae ja chuke hai
 He also agreed that Modi and BJP President Amit Shah are pitting one community in Bihar against another
 unhone is sandarbh main ek pakistani vishleshak kaa zikr kiya, jiske anusaar padosi desh isse ubarne kii koshish kar rahaa he jabaki bharat is ore bad rahaa he
 Attacking Jaitley after Finance Minister Jaitley has said that Modi has been the worst victim of Modi since 2002, Shourie said that this is the worst defense he has heard
 ashishnutaa ke vaataavaran ke khilaaf puraskaar lautaa rahe lekhakon or kalakaaron ke samarthan main utarate hue unhone india today channel par karan thapar se kaha ki ve desh kii 'chetana ke prahari' hai or unke iraadon par sawaal nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Appreciating scientists like PM Bhargava and Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy, Shourie questioned whether these people could be called fiery, a term Jaitley used? He said that these people contributed immensely to the country and those who attacked them did not read any book in the last 20 years
 'jo log do paragraph nahin likh sakate ve lekhakon par faisle karne ke liye baithe hue hai
 ' kisi bhi or har mudde par pradhanmantri se nahin bolne kii ummid rakhane ke bijepi netaaon ke baar-baar dohraye gaye bayanon ko khaarij karte hue shouri ne kaha ki vah vahi kar rahe hai or un muddon par nahin bol rahe hai jin par unhen bolnaa chahie
 He said, 'the Prime Minister is not the Section Officer of the Homeopathy Department
 vah koi vibhaagadhyaksh nahin hai
 He is the Prime Minister
 unhen desh ko naitik path dikhaanaa hoga
 They have to establish ethical standards
 ' Shourie cited Modi's tweets on issues such as the birthday of Union Minister Mahesh Sharma, the birthday of James Cameron, the stampede in Mecca and the Ankara blast shortly after the Dadri incident
 purv kendriya mantri ne kaha ki lekin unhone dadri ghatana or haryana main do dalit bacchon kii hatya jaisi ghatnaon par chuppi saadhe rakhi
 He remains silent, while his party colleagues and ministers keep the issue alive
 yah puche jane par ki kya modi kii chuppi raajnneetik he, unhone kaha, 'mujhe aisa lagata he
 You cannot walk both ways
 aap bahut majboot netaa hai, lekin aap apane sadasyon ko niyantrit nahin kar sakate
 'referring to Sharma's controversial remarks on former President Abdul Kalam, he said that allocating Sharma the house in which Kalam lived' is like spitting on people's mouths
 ' 'yah sachmuch main pratikatmak he
 In response to a question, he said that the intention is to win the Bihar election at any cost
 tippaniyan He said that Modi is not realizing the consequences of his silence and this fire will burn not only him but the entire country
 ye mudde desh ke saamaajik taane-bane main tanaav daalenge
 Shourie said that with his speeches on the quota issue in Bihar, Modi has brought himself down to the level of Lalu Prasad, while Nitish Kumar looks like a politician
 unhone bihar main bijepi ke haarane par pakistan main pataakhe jalaae jane ke bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke bayaan ko bhi khaarij kar diya or kaha ki ab chijen alag hai
 In this context, he quoted a Pakistani analyst saying that fireworks have already been burnt there

 Coming out in support of the writers and artists returning the award against the atmosphere of intolerance, he told Karan Thapar on India Today channel that he is the 'sentinel of consciousness' of the country and his motives cannot be questioned
 piem bhargav jaise vaigyanikon or infosis ke sansthaapak enaar narayanamurthi kii saraahna karte hue shouri ne sawaal kiya ki ye log ugr kahe ja sakate hai, jis shabd kaa istemaal jetali ne kiya tha? unhone kaha ki in logon ne desh ke liye apaar yogadan diya or jin logon ne un par prahaar kiya, unhone pichley 20 saal main koi pustak nahin padhi
 'those who cannot write two paragraphs are sitting to judge the writers
 ' Rejecting repeated statements of BJP leaders hoping not to speak to the Prime Minister on any and every issue, Shourie said that he is doing the same and not speaking on the issues on which he should speak

 Appreciating scientists like PM Bhargava and Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy, Shourie questioned whether these people could be called fiery, a term Jaitley used? He said that these people contributed immensely to the country and those who attacked them did not read any book in the last 20 years

 hameshaa kisi na kisi cheez kii talash main lage rahanaa insaan kii fitrat hoti he
 When he reaches a point, he automatically turns to the other thing and wants to find it
 in baton main koi buraai nahin he
 The problem starts when people in the matter of marital relationship also refrain from keeping their spirit
 jeevanasathi kii talash puri hone ke baad kuch log apane life partner se bevafaayee karne se nahin hichakate
 On the other hand, there are some people who consider marital life as an unbreakable bond, but are disappointed due to not being completely happy with the partner
 aise logon kii dharna yah hoti he ki vaivaahik jivan main patni yaa pati ke saath romance ke pal bitaana mumkin nahin he
 There is a cure for this merge, provided special things are taken care of
 is maamle main jad ho chuki dharanaon ko man se dur nikaalane kii sakht jarurat hoti he
 1
 sabase pehali baat to yah ki man main yah vishwaas hona chahie ki vaivaahik jivan ke daayre ke rahete hue romance ke sunahare pal bitaye ja sakate hai
 For this, you need to see your life partner from a different perspective
 2
 Always try to find a good thing in your spouse
 sahi maukey par ek-duusare kii tarif jarur karen
 True appreciation will add to those qualities
 striyon ke maamle main yah baat zyada sateek baithti he
 3
 yah ganth baandh len ki kabhi kisi insaan kii sari icchhaaen trupt nahin hotin
 Desire is infinite just like the ocean
 jyon-jyon icchhaaen puri hoti jaati hai, inkaa kolahal badhata hi jaataa he
 4
 ek survey main yah baat saamne ai he ki 35 fisadi mahilaayein subah apane pati ke jagane se pehle hi saaj-shringaar kar leti hai, taaki ve pati ke saamne khubasurat dikh saken
 This is a positive thinking
 5
 Do not forget that it is beneficial to stay fit and fit in front of a life partner at home
 ek puraani ukti he ki agar bhagwaan vishnu bhi saaf-suthere na rahen or akarmanya ho jaaen, to lakshmi bhi unhen chhodane main der nahin lagaayengi
 Even if it is an exaggeration, it has been said with the intention of developing the right thinking among the common people
 kehane kaa matlab yah he ki sirf premi-premika hi ek-duusare ke liye sajen-sanware, to yah saraasar ninsaphi he
 Then be ready to mix more sweetness in married life

 uttar pradesh ke jhaansi jila mukhyalay se kanpur hive par 25 kilometre chalane parparichha thermal power plantaurabetwa nadike bich sthit richora or parichha gaanv vikaas kii keemat adaa kar rahe hai
 You will not see a single cattle in these villages
 richora gaanv ke 30 varshiya amar singh ahirwar paanch varsh pehle do gaay kharidkar laae the
 But after a few days their cows started to remain ill
 doctoron se pataa chalaa ki betwa nadi kaa pradooshit pani pine se gaayon ke pet memrakhajama ho rahi he
 Within a few days, both of Amar's cows died
 bundelkhand packejake tahat amar singh ko jo teen bakriyaan mili thim, unamem se aakhri ne pichley hafte dam tod diya
 Showing the ash spread on the banks of the Betwa River, Amar Singh says, "the power plant got electricity in the village, but the ash of the plant has taken away the breath of the Betwa river
" ''jhaansi-kanpur hive par jaise-jaise parichha power plant ke najadik pahunchate hai, taapaghar kii ore jane vaali sadaken raakh se pati najar aati hai
 There is an empire of ashes on the roofs of houses
 yahi raakh parichha gaanv main rahane vaale 75 saal ke ramsevak kii saanson main bhi bhar gai he
 Ramsevak has become a TB patient, his wife also died fighting the disease two years ago
 do jawan bete hai, jo apane parivaar ko lekar kisi bhi keemat par gaanv main nahin rahanaa chaahate par ramsevak ko apane purakhon kaa makaan chhodia gavaara nahin
 The good rainfall this year has provided some relief
 chhaton par jami koyale kii raakh ko barish kaa pani baha to le gaya par isane gaanv ke kinare bah rahi betwa ko or "vishaiylla'' karne main koi kasar nahin chodi
 Not only the Paricha power plant located in Bundelkhand, the area of sonbhadra, also known as Urjunchal in the country, is also turning into a pile of ash coming out of the heat
 november, 2009 main centre sarkaar ke van or paryaavaran mantralay ne sabhi taap bijligharon ko paanch varsh ke bheetar utsarjit hone vaali raakh ke shat-pratishat upyog ke aadesh die the
 The way the government order has mocked these thermal power stations, the report of the "central Electricity Authority" testifies this
 report ke anusaar "neshnal thermal power corporation'' (antipisi) ke vindhyachal, rihand or singrauli taapagharon ne mahaj 60 fisadi raakh kaa hi upyog kiya or baaki raakh "aish dam'' main daal di gai
 The Anpara and Obra power stations of Uttar Pradesh Production Corporation used only less than six per cent of the ash and filled the ash dam with the remaining ash
 report ke mutabik, urjaanchal main salanaa 90 lakh ton se zyada raakh baandhon main jamaa ho rahi he
 According to the report released in 2017 by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), only 43 per cent of the total 18 thermal power stations in Uttar Pradesh are used
 vaise uttar pradesh ke aas-paas ke rajyon kaa bhi fliash ke istemaal kaa record kuch khaas nahin
 In Chhattisgarh, 31 percent of the ash of power stations is used and only 29 percent in Madhya Pradesh
 is raakh ne bijligharon ke ird-gird based ilaakon main logon kaa jivan naarkeey bana diya he
 Uttar Pradesh Energy Minister Shrikant Sharma says, "the environment ministry is strict on brick kilns due to air pollution, so brick manufacturing from the ashes of the power plant is not only eco-friendly but also reduces the cost
 sarkaar sabhi taapagharon ko aadesh dene ja rahi he ki ve apane "soshal responsibility fund'' (siaref) ke tahat flani aish se eent banane kaa plant bhi lagaaein
 The ash that flows out of the dam, in the villages of Richhora and Parichha, just behind the Pariparicha thermal power plant, tells a different story
 30 varsh pehle das hajaar se adhik aabaadi vaale in gaanvon se aadhe se zyada log palaayan kar gaye hai
 Mahavir Singh, a philanthropist from Paricha, says, "if the water of the river becomes poisonous in Bundelkhand, longing for water, the condition of the villages along its banks can be gauged
 '' varsh 1984 main kaam shuru karne vaale parichha thermal power plant main ab chah ikaiyaan hai, jahaan rojaanaa 16,000 metric ton koyale kii khapat hoti he or rojaanaa 14,000 metric ton geeli raakh nikalati he jise dam main bheja jaataa he
 An official of the Parichha Thermal Power Plant states, "both the dams for ash emanating from units of 210 MW capacity have been filled while a dam compartment for units of 110 MW capacity has been filled
 ab raakh duusare kampartment main daali ja rahi he
 There is also a system of keeping ash for six months
 ''adhikariyon kii manamanisupreme court ke adhivaktaaon or pradooshan kaa adhyayan karne vaale kaaryakartaaon kii team 21 july ko jab uttar pradesh rajya vidyut utpaadan nigam kii sabase badi pariyojna anapara se nikalne vaali raakh kaa prabandhan dekhne pahunchi to dang rah gai
 The committee members came to know that the "ash water recycling plant" installed to prevent the ash from Anpara going to Rihand Dam has been closed for the last month and a half
 anapara project ke bagal main maujuud gaanv pipari main rahane vaale shyaam kumaar bataate hai, "aish dam ke rakrakhaav se jude adhikariyon kii laaparvaahee or paryaapt dekharekh na karne se aish water ricycling plant main lage pipe aksar tut jate hai
 Due to which the ash not only goes to the Rihand reservoir but also reaches the surrounding fields and destroys the entire crop
 '' haalanki anapara tapiya pariyojna ke raakh dam ke prabharee vinod kumaar graminon ke aaropon ko sire se khaarij karte hai
 Vinod Kumar says, "all three recycling plants of Anpara are operational and ash is not being shed in the Rihand reservoir
 ''sonbhadra ke thermal power plant se "aish ricycling plant'' tak raakh ko trakon se pahunchane main ho rahi gadabadi kii shikaayat sthaneey saamaajik kaaryakarta ashish choube ne neshnal green tribunal or paryaavaran vibhaag se kii he
 Says Ashish, "on the shaktipur-kota road in Urjhanchal, ash from the power project, along with charred coal residues, is being dumped on both sides of the road
 jisase sthaneey paryaavaran ko nuksaan pahunchaa he
 "the arbitrariness of the officials also made Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who arrived in Sonbhadra to start the development schemes on July 7, be offended
" unhen sonbhadra ke salakhan main bijligharon se nikalne vaali raakh se "fliash brick plant'' kaa shilanyas karnaa tha
 At the last minute, the Chief Minister's Office came to know that the proposed foundation stonework was disputed
 aanan-fanan mukhyamantri kaa kaarykram nirast kiya gaya
 The poisonous water from the ashes being mixed in the moaning Betwa river Betwa has killed more than 50 domesticated animals in Parichha and Richhaura villages in the last two years
 parichha gaanv ke jagadish parihaar bataate hai, "betwa main chemical vaali raakh milane kaa asar gaanv ke handpampon par bhi padaa he
 Now these hand pumps also provide polluted water
 '' richora gaanv ke pradhan kuldeep singh bataate hai, "betwa nadi kii talahati main 20 se 25 foot tak raakh jamaa ho jane se nadi chhichhli ho gai he
 When a little water increases, it reaches the village
 ''nadi par bana parichha baandh bhi chhichhlaa ho gaya he
 Srischand, an engineer posted at the irrigation department in Jhansi, says, "the storage of ash in the foothills of the dam has reduced its storage capacity considerably, which can cause irrigation crisis in the coming days
" ''paravaan nahin chadha prayasaparichha bijlighar kii raakh ko thikaane lagane ke liye ek nayaa aish dam banane kii bhi yojana he
 For this, 572 acres of land in the village adjacent to the plant, Maheba, Gulara and Murata were to be acquired
 kisaanon ko jameen kaa muaavja dene ke liye "central power finance corporation'' se 195 karod rupye kaa rin bhi parichha thermal power plant ko mil gaya
 But the administration could not get the No Objection Certificate from the Ministry of Environment because as per the rules, the land of the dam should be 500 meters away from the national highway and the river
 lekin betwa nadi or hive ke bich kii duuri hi 500 meter se kam he or isi ke bich main adhigrahit kii jane vaali jameen he
 Although Chief General Manager of Paricha Thermal Power Plant O
 pi
 Verma explains, "will write a letter to the Ministry of Environment requesting a reconsideration of the decision
 '' parichha thermal power plant prashasan samet tamaam bijlighar apane fli aish ko vibhinn upyogkartaaon ko muft main dene kii peshkash kar rahe hai kyonki paryaavaran mantralay kii saal 2016 main jari adhisuchana main saaf ullekh he ki bijlighar ke 100 kilometre ke daayre main raakh upyogkarta tak pahunchane kaa kharch beijilghar uthayega, 300 kimi ke daayre main pahunchane kaa kharch upyogkarta or beijilghar baraabar-baraabar uthaaenge

 Azam Udham Singh was a great revolutionary who sacrificed his life in the name of the country to avenge the Jallianwala Bagh massacre
 landan main jab unhone maaikel o
 When Dwyer was shot, the story of this Indian hero spread all over the world
 teraa april 1919 ko amritsar main baisakhi ke din hue narsanhaar ke samay o
 Dwyer was the governor of Punjab province
 usee ke aadesh par brigadier general rejinald diar ne jaliyanvaala baag main sabha kar rahe nirdosh logon par andhadhundh goliyaan barasaai thim
 Born on December 26, 1899 in Sunam village in Sangrur district, Punjab, Udham Singh had vowed to avenge the massacre at Jallianwala Bagh, which he himself completed 21 years after the mass murder of hundreds of his countrymen
 jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay ke professor chaman laal kaa kahana he ki udham singh ek aise nirbhik yoddha the jinhone apni pratigya puri kar duniya main bharatiyon kii veerta kaa paracham fahraaya
 In 1901, Udham Singh's mother and his father died in 1907
 is ghatana ke chalate unhen apane bade bhai ke saath amritsar ke ek anathalay main sharan leni padi
 Udham Singh's childhood name was Sher Singh and his brother's name Mukta Singh, who got new names in the orphanage as Udham Singh and Sadhu Singh respectively
 anathalay main udham singh kii jindagi chal hi rahi thi ki 1917 main unke bade bhai kaa bhi dehanth ho gaya or vah duniya main ekadam akele rah gaye
 In 1919, he left the orphanage and joined the freedom fight with the revolutionaries
 dow
 In protest against the arrest of Satyapal and Saifuddin Kichlu and the Rollat act, people held a meeting on the Baisakhi day on 13 April 1919 in Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar in which Udham Singh was working to provide water to the people

 To save lives, many people jumped into the well in the park
 baag main lagi pattica par likhaa he ki 120 shav to sirf kuen se hi mili
 The official death toll was stated to be 379, while according to Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya at least 1300 people were killed
 swami shraddhanand ke anusaar marane waalon kii sankhya 1500 se adhik thi, jabaki amritsar ke tatkaaleen civil sarjan doctor smith ke anusaar marane waalon kii sankhya 1800 se adhik thi
 The exact number of people killed in Jallianwala Bagh could never be revealed due to political reasons
 is ghatana se vir udham singh vichlit ho uthe or unhone jaliyanvaala baag kii mitti haath main lekar maaikel o
 Sworn to teach Dwyer a lesson
 udham singh apane kaam ko anjaam dene ke uddeshy se 1934 main landan pahunche
 There he bought a car and a revolver and waited for the right time
 bharat ke is yoddha ko jis maukey kaa intjaar tha, vah unhen 13 march 1940 ko us samay mila jab maaikel o

 Rahman (@arrahman) November 23, 2018 karnataka main vidhayakon ke lagaataar istifon se kumaraswami sarkaar kaa raajnneetik sankat gaharaata ja rahaa he
 The resignation of 13 congress-jds mlas and the resignation of an independent MLA minister has brought the Kumaraswamy government to a minority
 aise main satta par kabje kii jang main gend ab bijepi ke paale main he, dekhnaa hoga ki vah vidhayakon ke jodtod se sarkaar banane kii disha main kadam uthaaegi yaa phir vidhansabha chunaav ke jariye satta main vaapasi ke raste ko chunegi
 Let us know that the Kumaraswamy government had just completed the political journey of one year, that trouble has come to the fore
 congress ke 10 or jedies ke 3 vidhayakon ke istife ke baad nirdaleey vidhayak nagesh ne bhi apana mantripad chhod diya he
 With this Nagesh withdrew his support from the congress-jds government and announced his support to the BJP
 haalanki congress-jedies ke netaa abhi bhi sarkaar bachaane kii kavayad main jute hai
 On the other hand, the resignation of the rebel mlas of the congress-jds has not yet been accepted by the Speaker Ramesh Kumar
 unhone is sambandh main mangalvaar ko faisla lene kii baat kahi he
 In such a situation, the efforts of the congress-jds to save the government have also intensified
 congress ke diggaj netaa mallikarjun khadge, karnataka congress prabharee kasee venugopal, ji parameshwar or embi patil lagaataar baithken kar baagiyon ko manaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 These Congress leaders are also in touch with HD Deve Gowda
 karnataka ke vidhayakon ke aankade dekhen to kul 225 sadsy hote hai or inamen ek manonith hota he
 BJP currently has 105 mlas
 jabaki congress ne apane 80 or jedies ke 37 vidhayak ke saath sarkaar banaai thi, jise basapa ke ek or ek nirdaleey vidhayak ne samarthan diya tha
 In such a situation, if the Congress accepts the resignation of 10 and 3 JDS mlas, the majority will be counted on 210 seats and any party will need the support of 106 mlas to remain in the government
 sarkaar banane ke philhal aankade bijepi ke paksh main dikh rahe hai
 This is the reason why former Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa is seen standing in favor of forming the government
 isiilie unhone kaha tha ki bijepi main log ‘sanyasi' nahin hai jo sarkaar banane kii sambhaavnaaon se inkaar karenge
 This is the reason that as soon as the independent MLA Nagesh withdrew support on Monday, Yeddyurappa's PA left for Mumbai with him
 iske sanket saaf he ki yediurppa sarkaar banane ke liye puri tarah se sakriy ho gaye hai
 However, the national leadership of the BJP is still adopting a strategy of 'weight and watch' more than forming a government
 bijepi maujuuda raajnneetik halaat main bhale hi sarkaar banane main abhi safal ho jaae, lekin sankat ke badal hameshaa mandaraate rahenge
 If sources are to be believed, this is the reason why the national leadership of BJP is planning to contest more elections than forming a government
 bijepi kaa sheersh netritv karnataka kii satta ko bies yediurppa ko dene ke paksh main nahin he
 At the same time, Yeddyurappa is clearly understanding that if this time he does not succeed in becoming CM, then it is not necessary that he will win the election after the election
 kyonki yediurppa 76 saal kii umr ke padaav par hai
 That is why they do not want to let this opportunity go out of their hands
 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi bies yediurppa kii bajaay pradhanmantri narendra modi ke chehre ke sahare chunavi maidan main utari thi
 It also got a tremendous advantage for the party and the BJP was successful in winning 25 out of the total 28 Lok Sabha seats in Karnataka
 isiilie party kaa sheersh netritv chahta he maujuuda maahaul main chunavi ran main utarana phydemand rahegaa
 This can provide political advantage as well as avoid the questions of opposition
 bijepi isi kashmakash main abhi fansi hui najar aa rahi he

 Can't sleep again after breaking? Do this work 8- If you do not get the freedom to openly speak in a relationship, then there is a problem in the relationship
