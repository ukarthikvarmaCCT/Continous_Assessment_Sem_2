 the people of Hindi Pradesh are buying darkness from the Hindi media by paying money from their pockets
 scrol kii puri team ko shandaar badhai
 In 1985, an agreement was reached between the Rajiv Gandhi government at the Center and the All Assam Students Union (AASU) that the National Register of Citizens formed in 1951 would be updated
 iske liye 27 march 1971 ke baad aae logon ko chhanta jayega
 In 2010, the Congress government of Assam carried out the pilot project but postponed it due to violence
 iske baad 2013 main supreme court ke aadesh par yah kaam shuru hua na ki centre or rajya sarkaar kii pahal par
 The Supreme Court is monitoring this
 31 agast ko jo antim suchi ai he usase mila kya ? assam kii raajnneeti bahari bahari ke naam par hoti rahi jise bijepi ne badal kar bangladeshi ghuspaithiya kar diya taaki sirf musalamaanon ko nishaanaa banaaya ja sake or hindu bengaaliyon ko nagirakata de di jaae
 That is why the Central Government brought the Citizenship Amendment Act, but it was deferred in view of the opposition and rebellion of the indigenous people in Assam
 amit shah ne kaha he ki yah bill unki praathamikta main he
 Would he like to bring this bill overnight like Kashmir? Or keep looking for an excuse to postpone it? 3 crore 30 lakh, 27,661 people applied for National Register of Citizens
 isamen se 3,11,21,004 lakh naagarik suchi main aa gaye hai
 Only 6 percent were out
 19,06,657 log baahar rah gaye hai
 How many Hindus and Muslims are there among them, it cannot be said but both are there
 neshnal register ko lekar shesh bharat khaskar hindi pradeshon main bhram failaayaa gaya ki yah musalamaanon ke khilaaf he
 Bangladeshi is against infiltrators
 jab july 2018 main asthaayee suchi nikali to lakhon kii sankhya main upi bihar se assam gaye bhojpuri vaasi bhi baahar ho gaye
 The final list also has many Bengali Hindus as well as Muslims
 kisi ke pita kaa naam he to maa kaa nahin
 If someone's mother's name is not a daughter
 maanviya traasadee kaa ambara laga he vahaan
 The readers of AAP Hindi Pradesh have considered cow dung by the mainstream of Hindi media
 is traasadee ke detail se vanchit kar diya he
 Only then will any leader come among you and say that there will be a National Register here too
 scrol kii kai reporting ko padhakar lagata he ki register ko lekar musalamaanon ke kilaaf jo dharna banaai gai wo thik nahin he
 This has upset everyone
 har report main aapako pataa chalegaa ki itani badi karrwai kaise ho rahi he
 An unknown objector makes an objection, people are reaching for the document and the objectioner has run away
 suchi prakashit hoti he to aapatti sahi maan lee jaati he
 The real problem is with the Foreigner Tribunal
 uske kai faislon par sawaal uthe hai
 Samanullah, who fought in the Kargil war, was also declared a foreigner
 is tribunel ke zyaadaatar faisale musalamaanon ke kilaaf nazar aate hai
 People are more apprehensive about this
 assam ke mul nivaasiyon kii maang thi ki unke ilaake kaa land scape bahari logon se badal gaya he
 For them, the division of the exterior was not in the name of Hindu or Muslim
 bengali bhashi, hindi bhashi or kuch had tak nepali bhashi ke kilaaf unki maang thi
 Now BJP jumps into it and brings the politics of Bangladeshi infiltrators so that Muslims can be targeted without being called Muslims
 lekin jab register kii antim suchi prakashit hui to badi sankhya main hindu bengali bhi baahar ho gaye hai
 The natives would also be shocked that most of the people they considered outsiders are now local
 unke liye bengali hindu or musalmaan donon bahari hai jo 1971 ke baad aae hai lekin mili kitne, maatr 19 lakh
 Out of that, if the Central Government gives citizenship to Bengali Hindus, then how many will be left
 bijepi ne ghuspaithiyon ke naam par kya kya nahin kaha
 There are 4 million infiltrators in Assam
 dilli or rajasthan me bhi register kii baat ho rahi he
 As if Bangladesh has come to India
 bhale hi bijepi naagarikta kanoon ke zarie inhen naagarik bana de lekin assam ke mulnivaasiyon main yah baat hameshaa ke liye rah jaaegi ki un par yah thopa gaya he
 Obviously, the communal politicization of this problem will continue to haunt Assam in the future
 scrol par sara detail he
 India has not formally spoken to Bangladesh on this issue
 neshnal register kii antim suchi aane se pehle videsh mantri jaishankar bangladesh gaye the, unhone koi baat nahin kii
 He said that the National Register is an internal matter
 bangladesh kahata rahaa he ki uskaa yahaan se ghuspaith nahin hui he
 It is not its citizens
 phir ye log pahchaan ke baad kaise bheje jaaenge
 If the government was serious then why not talk to Bangladesh
 isi july main grahamantri amit shah kehete hai ki antarrashtriya kanoon ke hisaab se jo bhi bharat kaa nahin he, use us desh main bheja jayega
 But no such treaty with Bangladesh has been done till date
 nae ditension centre banaae ja rahe hai
 How frightening it would be to see that people would be placed in such a center
 vasudaiv kutunbakam kehane vaale desh main apane hi logon ke saath aisa hota rahe, yah us hindi pradeshon ke kabhi bura nahin lagegaa jiske sochane samajhane kii shakti or samvedansheeltaa hindi media or sampradayik raajnneeti ke zarie khatm kar di gai he
 Actually, if there is any in the Detention Center, then these are Hindi states
 inke yuva hai
 As long as the youth of the Hindi states do not expel themselves from the Detention Center of this media and politics, there will be no light within them
 ve hameshaa hameshaa ke liye abhishpt rahenge
 You will continue to consider your narrowness as greatness
 isliye zaruri he ki hindi pradeshon ke noujvaan apane gharon se in akhbaaron ko phenk den
 Cut off the connection of channels which have made a mechanism to keep them in the detention center of bogus information
 main bhi jaanata hum ki aap bagair soochna ke nahin rah sakate
 No one can live lekin inamen to soochna he hi nahin
 If you throw these newspapers, then a good newspaper will come in their place
 achche channel aaenge
 You youth need to get out of the darkness
 acchhee patrakarita ke liye aapako har din kii aadat or aalas se nikalnaa hi hoga
 This current form of Hindi media has to be rejected
 unke banaae ditension centre se nikalnaa hi hoga
 Not tomorrow, but today you have to come out, do not go to the exception of some of their good works, look at the wounds and pus that they are creating and spreading

 Narendra Modi broke his fast on Monday evening but Congress leader Shankar Singh Vaghela ended his fast today
 waghela ne upwas todane ke baad kaha ki meraa upwas koi utsav nahin tha
 At the same time, State Congress President Arjun Modwadia said that Modi's fast after spending crores of rupees, which was not even fasting, was cheating
 waghela ne kal kaha tha ki narendra modi apane elaan ke mutabik 72 ghante upwas nahin kar paae
 This exposed their reality to the public
 waghela kaa kahana he ki modi bhale hi peeche hat jaaen wo elaan ke mutabik tay samay par hi anshan todenge
 Vaghela is sitting on a fast outside the Sabarmati Ashram
 bijepi ne waghela ke upwas ko ghabrahat main jataai gai pratikriya bataaya he
 There has been a ruckus in UP after the death of the rape victim's father in Unnao
 aarope ilaake ke bijepi vidhayak kuldeep singh senger or uske sahyogiyon par he
 However, he continues to deny it
 jabaki peedita apane bayaan par adig he
 In an exclusive conversation with Aaj Tak, he explained the act of the MLA in a systematic manner
 peedita ne bataaya ki ye ghatana 4 june 2017 kii he
 Around 8 pm, a lady from the locality took us to MLA Kuldeep Sengar
 jo bijepi ke netaa hai
 Where he raped me
 gharavaalon ko bataane par maarane kii dhamkeepidita ne aarope lagaaya he ki vidhayak ne rape ke baad use dhamkee di ki agar ghar main bataaya to puure parivaaravaalon ko marava duungaa
 The victim said, 'today he did what he threatened
 hamen ek saal se insaaf nahin mil rahaa he
 My father would have survived even if i beat him a bit, but Kuldeep Singh, Atul Singh together killed my father
 'papa ko isliye marapidita ne bataaya ki jab hamaari koi sunwaayee nahin hui to hamane court main 156 / 3 kaa cese kar diya
 After this, when my father Unnao came from Delhi, the MLA and his people beat up my father badly for withdrawing the case
 police ne nahin karaayaa ilajpeedita ne bataaya ki unhone mere papa ko neem ke ped se baandhakar or pani daal-daalkar maaraa
 During this time the police also stood there
 police vahaan se hamaare papa ko le gai or aspataal ke bajaay jail main daal diya
 Our father was not even treated
 yogi se mila aashwaasanyogi ji mili to unhone hamaari aplicoshan lekar kaha ki chaar-paanch din main jaanch ho jaaegi
 But after that there was no investigation
 postmortem report main pitayee kaa khulasapostmortem report ke mutabik peedit ke pita ko buree tarah peeta gaya tha
 According to the report, serious injury marks have been reported at 14 places in the body

 Know what is there among students studying from LSR that distinguishes them from other college girls: 1
 LSR kii ladakiyon kafishan sensokamaal kaa hota he
 Anyone can look good in branded clothes, but the girls here carry the clothes of Sarojini Market famous for cheap clothes
 yahaan tak ki koi andaja bhi nahin laga saktaa he ki kapadaa branded he yaa local market kaa
 2
 lajpat nagar or greater kailash main kaajal lagaae hue or bade yearrings pahane hue ladakiyon ko ek saath dekhen to samaj jaaen ki ye jarur LSR kii hongi
 The girls here have a craze of big ear rings
 3
 You can know that these girls belong to LSR through their 'hello, hello' way
 4
 Instead of calling their college canteen as canteen, they call it cafeteria
 5
 Girls here like to visit Sarojini Nagar, Lajpat Nagar and Greater Kailash for shopping
 6
 One special thing about LSR girls is that they talk with eyes together
 yahi nahin har koi inaki communication skills kaa divaana he
 7
 na to inhen boring log pasand hai na hi boring baaten
 Cool but smart attitude is their hallmark
 8
 It is not that they are just fashionistas
 ye beauty vid brain kaa combination hai
 Whether it is the country's most prestigious civil exam or some other field, the girls here have proved themselves everywhere
 9
 The girls here are feminist and independent
 inhen har wo cheez pasand he jo ek aurat ke independent or aatmanirbhar hone ke liye jaruri he
 10

 When 49-year-old Abhay Jain, an enthusiastic farmer from Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh, started cultivating sandalwood three years ago, people got a glimpse of him
 lekin aaj teen sau acre main faile chandan ke 36,000 ped aath se das foot oonche ho chuke hai
 In the village of Khaparkhera, twenty-five km from Khandwa, for the cultivation of sandalwood, Jain purchased the barren land of the hill, and the first people of the village came down on his opposition
 unhen lagata tha ki chandan ke ped lagane kaa matlab he saanp or ajgar ko bulaava dena
 But Jain took the people into confidence and then the villagers not only helped them in the cultivation of sandalwood but also unanimously changed the name of the village to Chandanpur
 kuch hi samay main patharilii jameen par chandan ke paudhe lahalha uthe
 The scent started reaching far
 chandan kaa yah khet itnaa prasidgh ho gaya ki ise dekhne ke liye dur-dur se log yahaan aane lage
 This sandalwood horticulture was like a cult for the Jains

 But they still had more obstacles in the way of realizing their dream

 loksabhaa main buudhvaar ko grih mantralay kii taraf se pesh kiye gaye vidhi-viruddh kriyalap (nivaaran) sanshodhan bill (unlawful Activities (prevention) Amendment Act- UAPA) par charchaa hui
 During this discussion from the opposition, the bill was opposed and many kinds of questions were raised
 charchaa kaa jawaab dete hue grih mantri amit shah ne vipaksh par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 He said that it is the need of the hour that tough laws be made against terrorism
 saath hi saath unhone ye bhi kaha ki kanoon ke dil main urban naksaliyon ke liye koi dayaa nahin he
 The bill was passed in the Lok Sabha after a long debate
 loksabhaa main amit shah ne kaha yah kanoon indira gandhi kii sarkaar lekar ai thi, ham to bas isamen chota-sa sanshodhan kar rahe hai
 But the leaders of the opposition who are opposing it should remember that when they amended this bill it was also right and what we are doing today is also right
 urban naksaliyon ko lekar unhone kaha ki saamaajik jivan main desh ke liye kaam karne vaale bahut log hai, lekin urban maoism ke liye jo kaam karte hai unke liye hamaare dil main bilkul bhi samvednaa nahin he
 On the question of misuse of the law, the Home Minister said that there are provisions in this bill that when a person will be declared a terrorist
 unhone kaha ki aatankwaad bandook se nahin balki prachaar or unmaad se paidaa hota he
 Why is anyone objecting in declaring those doing this as terrorists? amit shah bole ki vipaksh kah rahaa he ki sarkaar iske jariye kisi bhi computer main ghus jaaegi, agar aatankwaad se judaa kaam karoge to police aapke computer main jarur ghusegi
 The Home Minister said that even in this bill, we have kept the options open for appeal
 amit shah ne kaha ki jo log UPA sarkaar ke dauraan hamaare khilaaf jaanch kar rahe the vahi aaj NIA main karyrat hai, tab unpar bharosa tha to aaj kyon nahin he
 Amit Shah said that if there is terrorism in the mind of the person, then banning the organization will not do anything, then he will form a new organization, due to this it is necessary to bring a provision to declare the person also a terrorist
 unhone is dauraan america, UN, china, isroyal or pakistan jaise deshon kaa bhi udhaaharan diya
 They themselves are unable to understand whether the central employees are happy or regret about the report of the 7th Pay Commission
 kai vibhaagon main vetan vruddhi to ho gai he, lekin kai aise mudde hai jin par karmchaariyon kii aawaaj banakar union ne sarkaar ke samaksh chintaa vyakt kii he
 One of the many concerns has been about allowances
 karmchaaree unionon ke is mudde par aapatti jataane ke baad sarkaar ne gathit teen samitiyon main se ek ko alouns kaa mudda diya tha
 This committee submitted its report to the government after about eight months
 vittamantralay main yah report ab padi he
 According to the rule, this report is now sent to the Empowered Committee (empower Committee) through the Cabinet Secretary
 vahaan par is is prakaar kii report par samiti charchaa ke baad ek cabinet note taiyaar karti he
 This note is kept in the cabinet meeting of the government
 iske baad sarkaar is par nirnay leti he
 According to the information received from the sources so far, the report prepared after discussion with the staff unions on the Seventh Pay Commission is stuck with the Cabinet Secretary
 yah report abhi tak adhikaar praapt sachivon kii samiti (empower samiti) tak nahin pahunchi he
 It is clear here that the matter has just passed from the Ministry of Finance to the Cabinet Secretary
 isse yah bhi he ki kendriya karmchaariyon (central employees) ko abhi or intjaar karnaa hoga
 When this was discussed with the staff leader Shiv Gopal Mishra, he gave information about the rampant anger among the employees
 unka kahana he ki sarkaar is puure maamle main deree karne kii niti apana rahi he
 The government is not concerned about the interests of the employee
 unhone bataaya ki unhen karmchaariyon ke sanyukt sangh jesiem kii ore se sarkaar se vaarta ke liye bani samiti main 15 taarikh tak agenda dene ke liye kaha gaya tha
 But he clearly stated how the agenda can be given until the report of the committee is not known
 shivagopal mishra ne bataaya kiyah bahut hi afsos kii baat he ki, saatven vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ke anusaar makaan kiraaya evam anya bhatton ke jaunch ke liye sarkaar dwaara vitt sachiv ashok lavasa kii adhyakshata main gathit kamity kii bhatton par kii gai sifarish kii report abhi tak jesiem (staff said) ko nahin mili hai
 Mishra says that unfortunately till date, no decision has been taken in relation to house rent and other allowances as per the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission by the Finance Ministry, nor the allowances of the Lavasa Committee set up by the government to check the allowances
 But the recommendation report has been made public
 atah bhatte ke bare main samiti kii siforeeshon kaa vishleshan kiye bina visangatiyon ko taiyaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The comments jabaki duusari ore, carmik or prashikshan vibhaag (dopt) ne nae aadesh jari karte hue kaha he ki saatvaan vetan ayog (seventh Pay commission) ke karyanvayan main utpann hone vaale, kendriya sarkari karmchaariyon ke vetan or bhatte kii bhugtan sambandhi visangatiyon ko hal karne kii samay seemaa 15 november tak hogi
 Mishra said, as we have clarified at various levels, including Secretary (dopt), Cabinet Secretary (government of India) etc
, that the discrepancies cannot be prepared without analyzing the recommendations of the Committee on allowances
 " The issue of allowance was given to one of the three committees formed by the government after the employee unions objected to the issue
 is samiti ne kareeb aath maheene baad apni report sarkaar ko saunp di
 This report is now lying in the Ministry of Finance
 niyam ke anusaar is report ko cabinet secretary ke madhyam se ab shakti sampann samiti yani empower cameti (empower Committee) ke paas is report ko bheja jaataa he
 There, after discussion on this type of report, the committee prepares a cabinet note
 is note ko sarkaar kii cabinet baithak main rakhaa jaataa he
 After this, the government decides on it
 abhi tak kii sutron se praapt jaankaree ke anusaar saatven vetan ayog par karmchaaree unionon se charchaa ke baad taiyaar report cabinet secretary ke paas ataki he
 This report has not yet reached the Empowered Secretaries' Committee (empower Committee)
 yahaan yah saaf he ki maamla abhi vittamantralay se nikalakar cabinet sachiv tak hi pahunchaa he
 This also means that central employees will have to wait longer
 is bare main jab karmchaaree netaa shivagopal mishra se jab baat kii gai tab unhone karmchaariyon main vyaapt rosh ke bare main jaankaree di
 He says that the government is adopting a policy of delaying the entire matter
 sarkaar ko karmchaaree ke hiton kii chintaa nahin he
 He said that he was asked by the JCM, a union of employees' unions, to present the agenda by the 15th in a committee formed for talks with the government
 lekin unhone saaf kaha ki jab tak alouns cameti kii report kaa kuch pataa nahin chalata tab tak agenda kaise diya ja sakaat he
 Shivgopal Mishra said that it is a matter of great regret that according to the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission, the report of the recommendations made by the government on the allowances of the committee constituted under the chairmanship of Finance Secretary Ashok Lavasa, for checking house rent and other allowances
 The JCM (staff Side) has not yet been received

 Therefore, anomalies cannot be prepared without analyzing the committee's recommendations regarding allowances

 The deadline will be until 15 November

 During the hearing of a petition seeking a ban on the use of pellet guns in Jammu and Kashmir, the central government said in the court that it would soon start using a secret weapon to deal with militant protesters
 ise pellette gan ke pehle istemaal main laayaa jayega
 According to the central government, the smelly water, laser deselers and fast charge machines also have no effect on the protesters
 isliye majaburi main aakhri vikalp ke taur par pellette gan kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, appearing on behalf of the central government's plea, argued that pellet guns are used as the last option to control the disturbances in the state, the demonstration in Jammu and Kashmir at Jantar Mantar in Delhi There is no peaceful sit-in demonstration

 The plea of the petitioner said that this is a complex subject in itself and its solution can be political
 koi sarkaar apane logon ko maarane, andhaa yaa apahiz karne kii ijaajat nahin de sakati he, or court ko ye sunishchit karwaanaa hoga ki rajya main kanoon kaa raaj kaayam ho
 Due to pellet gun, people are becoming lame

 The Supreme Court sought the petitioner

 gurjar netaa karnal kirodi singh bansla ne gurjaron kii baithak ke baad yahaan elaan kiya he ki 15 may se ek baar phir se gurjar andolan shuru hoga
 At the same time, Rajputs have announced an agitation for upper caste reservation in May itself
 upi main obisi ke bantwaare kii khabar ke bich gurjaron ne is baar rajasthan main bhi gurjaron ke liye obisi main vargeekaran kii maang ko lekar andolan shuru karne kaa faisla kiya he
 It is worth mentioning that the government has given reservation to the Gurjars so far but every time the reservation limit is more than 50 percent, the Gurjar reservation is banned from the court
 bharatpur main bayana ke kaarwari gaanv main gurjar samudaay ke patelon ne gurjar netaa karnal kirodi singh bansla ke netritv main ek panchayat kii
 In this, it has been decided that Gurjar agitation will be started from May 15
 gurjar aarakshan sangharsh samiti ke sanyojak karnal kirodi singh bansla ne kaha ki agar sarkaar ne jald hi gurjar samudaay ko 50 fisadi daayre ke antargat aarakshan nahin diya to gurjar samudaay ek baar phir se 15 may se ek bada andolan shuru karegaa
 Bainsla has appealed to the people of Gurjar community to get ready in large numbers and assemble on May 15 in the village of Bayana, where the agitation will be started
 karnal bansla ne bataaya ki aagaamee 15 may se andolan shuru karne kaa elaan kar diya gaya he
 Pilupura of Bayana had earlier become the main center of the Gurjar movement and even today the same place has been chosen for the upcoming movement because a large number of people of Gurjar community live here

 rajput is baar aarakshan kii aarpaar kii ladaai ladenge
 It is worth noting that the Congress of Rajasthan's Gehlot and bjp's Vasundhara government have so far passed the proposal of providing 10 percent reservation to poor upper castes on economic basis four times, but due to lack of provision of reservation on economic basis in the constitution
 Every time the offer is canceled

 In a sarcastic tone, the bench asked the government not to tell us how the administration is working
 court ne kaha ki dilli ke dil main minto road par bas kuch minuton kii barish main hi dub gai
 On the other hand, people in Mumbai are dying by falling into the pits of the roads? What is happening in this country? What is this sleep? All this is surprising! The Supreme Court said that a few minutes of rain changed the map of Delhi
 If there was heavy rain, then what would happen to the capital is beyond imagination

 lekin pradhanmantri kaa prastaav vifal hua to uske saamne behad kadi raajnneetik chunauti hogi jahaan theresa me kii sarkaar girane se lekar ek baar phir nae sire se iyu se baahar nikalne kii kavayad shuru kerani hogi
 At this moment of decision, Prime Minister Theresa May fears that her party members may leave her side, along with the opposition in Parliament
 is dar ke chalate me ne beete ravivaar party ke saansadon ko chetavanee dete hue kaha tha ki bracsit maamle main vifal hona 'loktantr ke prati bharose kaa anarthakaari va akshamya ulanghan hoga
 'this fear of the Prime Minister can be gauged from the fact that while writing an article in a leading newspaper of the country, he appealed to his mps to support the proposal
 me ne apane lekh main kaha he ki bracit se sambandhit unke prastaav par sansad ke nichle sadan main vot daalana maujuuda peedi kaa sabase ahm faisla hoga
 In fact, it is very important for the Prime Minister to win this resolution in the lower house (house of Commons) because in the face of defeat here, he will have to take a fresh exercise to break away from the EU, along with the fear of losing power
 aarthik jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki yadi britain ko bina kisi samjhaute ke iyu se baahar nikalnaa padaa to uski arthvyavastha ko kabhi na bharpai hone vaali chhati pahunchane kaa dar he
 Significantly, for fear of defeat, the Prime Minister in May last month deferred voting on this proposal in the lower house of Parliament
 aaj hone vaali is meeting main me ko vipaksh or chote raajnneetik dalon ke saath-saath apni party ke adhikansh saansadon ke vot ko saadhane kii chunauti he
 The proposal of the House of Commonsotheresa will be debated in the lower house of the House of Commons
 sadan main kul 650 saansad hai or inase prastaav paarit karaane ke liye me ko kam se kam 318 saansadon kaa vot chahie
 This is the situation when 7 members of the Irish Nationalist Sinn Féin Party do not sit in Parliament, 4 speakers of the House do not exercise their franchise and 4 mps appointed to count votes do not count their votes
 bahes kaa muddabritish sansad main mangalvaar shaam 7 baje (jiemti) voting prakriya shuru hogi
 There will be a debate in Parliament before voting on whether Parliament has approved the government's proposal to exit the EU
 iske saath hi is prastaav ke saath sarkaar kaa ek raajnneetik prastaav bhi shaamil he jisamen iyu se baahar nikalne ke baad britain kaa sangh ke saath lambii avadhi main rishte kii avadharana di gai he
 Significantly, during this debate, mps of the lower house can also bring a proposal to amend the government's proposal

 In such a situation, the pressure to resign will increase after the defeat of the Brexit proposal

 majboot team india kal indore main khelaa jane vaala doosraa tii-20 match jitkar srilanka ke khilaaf teen maichon kii siries apane naam karne utregi
 There is no end to the troubles of the Lankan team, who had to face a crushing 93-run defeat in Cuttack
 yah nateeja ekatarfa hi rahaa, jisane kai ko yah sawaal poochne ke liye baadhya kar diya ki bharat kaa baar-baar itani kamjor team se khelnaa kitna taarkik he
 The series has proved to be no good preparation for India's challenging tour of South Africa in the next month, as the home team dominated the weak side in the preferred conditions
 bhartiya ballebaajon ne kamjor akraman ke khilaaf behtareen pradarshan kiya
 Runs and wickets always increase the confidence of the players, but the question is how much their performance will matter in South African conditions
 katak main team india kaa karnama, tii-20 main darj kii sabase badi jeetniyamit captain viraat kohli or shikhar dhawan tathaa bhubaneshwar kumaar kii gairmaujuudagi ke baavjood srilankai khilaadiyon ko koi raahat nahin mili, jo apane senior jaise angelo maithyuj par zyada hi nirbhar hai
 Senior Sri Lankan players have struggled to cope with the Indian bowlers and batsmen, but strong structures like the Indian Premier League (IPL) have created a good bench strength for the hosts
 reetika ke Bday se thik pehle mili jeet se rohit khush, aise kiya wishyujavemxra chahal or kuldeep yadav jaise khilaadi antarrashtriya pardaapan karne ke tunrat baad khud ke liye jagah banane main safal rahe
 Sri Lanka needs its captain, Thisara Perera, Upul Tharanga and Mathews to lead by example
 ye lambey samay se team kaa hissaa rahe hai or agar ye majboot pradarshan karte hai, to ve khilaadiyon main kuch utsaah or ummid jagaa sakate hai
 Players like Dushmant Chamira and Dhananjay De Silva have raised hopes
 bharat ko is srilankai team par dabadabaa banane ke liye bharat ko apni sarvshereshth team kii jarurat nahin he, lekin unka acha pradarshan karnaa aavashyak he
 Although he may not get huge credit for the success, the failure against the weaker team will definitely prove to be negative
 shaabaash dhoni! ab tak 24 baar kar chuke hai international cricket main yah ajoobaamahendra singh dhoni kii finishr kii bhoomika par bhi pichley kuch samay se sawaal uth rahe hai
 He scored a few runs after being sent to fourth place in Cuttack and is likely to bat at the same venue so that he can play a lot of overs in the match before the ODI and T20 challenge in South Africa

 In the film, Shahid will be seen playing a drunken surgeon lover who is madly in love with Preity
 lekin, priti kii shaadi kisi or se ho jaati he or kabir singh kaa kaa dil tut jaataa he
 Shahid will be seen romancing with Kiara Advani in the film
 donon star film ke pramotion main vyast hai
 Shahid Up revealed his Happiness Secret in a conversation
 hindustan times ke saath baatcheet main shahid kapur ne bataaya ki kaise unhone apane jivan main kathin samay kaa saamana kiya or unke bacchon, misha or zan ne unki madad karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 Shahid said that my children give me positive energy during difficult times
 shahid ne kaha ki jab wo down hote hai, to wo keval unke saath hi vakt bitaana chaahate hai
 The Kabir Singh star often shares stunning photos with Meesha and Zain
 shahid kii bacchon sang bonding shandaar he
 Shahid said, "my children
 ve mere enrgizer kii tarah hai
 They are full of positive energy
 mujhe or kuch nahin chahie
 i spend time with them and I'm fine
 ” shahid ne is baat kaa bhi zikr kiya ki dark kirdaar nibhaane se un par baari prabhaav padaa, lekin unke bacchon ne unhen aasaani se baahar aane main madad kii
 Talking of Kabir Singh, this is a remake of a Telugu film, Arjun Reddy
 arjuna reddy main vijay devarkonda ne mukhya bhoomika nibhaai
 Both films have been directed by Sandeep Wanga

 Hopefully, Kiara and Shahid's chemistry is also being liked by everyone

 According to the government's National Center for Disease Control (NCDC), 205 cases of swine flu were reported in the capital last year
 lekin is saal yah sankhya 3 farvari tak ek hajaar paar kar chuki he
 Rajasthan is at the forefront of swine flu
 rajasthan sarkaar ke aankadon ke mutabik, rajya main jahaan pichley saal 2,375 swine flu ke maamle saamne aae the vahiin is saal 7 farvari tak yah aankada 2,606 tak pahunch gaya
 Last year, where 221 deaths occurred in Rajasthan, this time the figure has reached 91

 Sudhir Bhandari says, "we are honestly reporting swine flu cases
" isi kaaran duusare rajyon ke mukaable hamaare number zyada dikh rahe hai
 "some senior officials of the Health Department of Rajasthan believe that the large number of cases in the state is due to the widespread screening of swine flu
 darasal, rajasthan main ghar ghar jaakar swine flu kii screening karne kaa aadesh diya gaya he
 The government claims that about 17 lakh people have been screened so far
 inamen se 27 hajaar logon ko saamaanya flu he
 a large number of them have been asked to undergo swine flu test
 unke mutabik, agar itane zyada bade str par pareekshan nahin hote to pataa hi nahin chalata ki bahut si mauton kii vajah swine flu he
 However, this argument of the authorities is surprising
 sarkaar ke ravaiye se bhi sawaal khadey hote hai
 The recent statement by Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma created an uproar in which he tried to describe the deaths as normal
 darasal, unhone kaha, ''swine flu se har saal mautein hoti hai
 The state BJP demanded his resignation
 vahiin, encidisi ke mutabik dilli main pichley saal do mautein hui thim, is saal 3 farvari tak ek bhi maut nahin hui

 According to experts, the death rate among people suffering from the flu is only one per cent, but due to lack of resistance or any other disease, it becomes fatal
 is flu ke do peak-sijan hote hai—monsoon (agast-aktubar) or sardiyaan (janvari-march)
 The fall in temperature is favorable for the virus, due to which its outbreak increases
 iskaa asar is baar zyada he kyonki farvari main bhi thand badi he

 Ujjain's 25-year-old Hemlata Marmat worked hard to become deputy collector
 lekin madhya pradesh lok seva ayog kii rajya seva praarambhik pariksha 2010 kaa agast, 2011 main aayaa nateeja unke liye niraashaa laayaa
 He was not selected for the main examination
 lekin haal hi main aae ek faisle ne unki ummiido ko phir se pankh laga die
 Reviewing the result of the examination, the list has been made again, in which 456 candidates, including Hemlata, have been declared to have passed the preliminary examination
 hemlata kahati hai, ''mujhe'' praarambhik pariksha main safal hone kii puri ummid thi
 "456 talented youths were unsuccessful due to one mistake of the Commission
 darasal praarambhik pariksha main saamaanya adhyayan or lok prashasan vishay main puche gaye kuch vastunishth prashn galat the jabaki kuch ke sahi uttar vikalp main shaamil nahin the
 But the commission ignored the results and in December 2011 conducted the main examination of 4,924 candidates
 soochna ke adhikaar main apane prapthank or ayog se praarambhik pariksha ke cat of marks kii jaankaree lene par anek ummidavaaron ne paaya ki prashnptr main prashn sahi hote yaa uttar kaa sahi vikalp diya gaya hota to ve bhi uteern ho sakate the
 On this basis, 12 candidates won
 pra
 Approached the High Court
 hycourt kii indore khandpeeth ne 7 disambar ko faisla diya ki yachika daayar karne vaale ummidavaaron ko atirikt ank die jaaen or yadi ve inhen paakar praarambhik pariksha ke cat of marks se zyada ank pate hai to unke liye alag se mukhya pariksha yojit kii jaae
 After this, the State Public Service Commission sought permission from the court not only to file a petition but also to give a list of wrong questions to all the candidates
 5 janvari ko ai nai suchi main 456 ummidavaaron ko uteern ghoshit kiya gaya or unke liye vishesh mukhya pariksha 3 farvari ko karaane kaa nirnay liya
 The Secretary of the Commission Drs
 madhu khare kahati hai, ''hamane parikshaarthiyon ke hit main hycourt ke nirdesh kaa paalan kiya he
 "but the candidates who were recently declared successful are still at a loss
 pehali suchi main uteern parikshaarthiyon ko mukhya pariksha kii taiyaari ke liye jahaan 4 maah mili, vahiin in parikshaarthiyon ko ek maah bhi nahin mil rahaa he
 Ashok Parmar, who has passed the new list, says, "the exam date should be extended
 '' yah maang vaazib isliye he kyonki mukhya pariksha de chuke or vishesh mukhya pariksha dene ja rahe parikshaarthiyon kii sammilit merit list banegi, aise main saaf he ki donon ko samaan avasar nahin die gaye
 The functioning of the Commission has been questioned before
 ratlam ke vidhayak paras sakalechaa kehete hai, '' 2010 ke parinaamon main to adaalat ke nirdesh par sudhaar kar liya gaya lekin 2008 or 2009 main bhi aisi hi gadbaditaan huin, unke prabhaviton kaa kya? ''ayog kii vivaadaaspad niyamavali ke kaaran anya parikshaon main bhi zyada ank laane vaali mahilaon kii jagah kam ank laane vaale purushon kaa chayan saakshaatkaar ke liye hota rahaa he, is maamle ko india today ne hi uthaaya tha
 Saklecha has also filed a PIL in the matter which is under consideration
 bihar main mokama se nirdaleey bahubali vidhayak anant singh kaa jail janaa tay he yah baat vah bhi jaanate hai
 Ever since AK-47 rifle, hand grenade and 26 rounds of bullets were recovered from his ancestral home, Anant Singh has been saying repeatedly that he has been framed at the behest of MP Lalan Singh and now he will get justice from the court 
 anant singh ke ghar par rabari devi ke kaarykaal main bhi chhapemari hui thi or ghanton tak donon taraf se fyring hui lekin us samay kii raajnneetik paristhiti main anant singh par nitish kumaar or lalan singh kaa aashirwad tha or vah vidhayak janata dal united ke tikat par chune gayi the
 But the foundation of this friendship when Nitish Kumar represented the Flood parliamentary constituency during the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, he was aware of the fact that Surajbhan Singh, an independent MLA from Mokama, joined the Lok Janshakti Party and gave him Ballia The election will not be easy without the help of Anant Singh as RJD-LJP is made joint candidate
 isliye nitish kumaar ke liye bahubali management ke prabharee lalan singh ne anant singh ko pataya tha
 At that time a public meeting was organized in which Anant Singh weighed Nitish Kumar with silver coins
 is kaarykram kaa yah video footage bhi kaafii charchit hua or nitish kumaar ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab bhi bana
 But it is also true that soon after Nitish Kumar came to power, Anant Singh turned twelve and started buying property in Patna for a quarter of a price
 kai baar maamla court kachhari or thane tak pahunchaa lekin anant singh ko satta kaa sangrakshan mila hua tha
 Due to Lallan Singh's disastrousness, no one could ever spoil Anant Singh
 yahaan tak ki pichley loksabhaa chunaav ke turant baad jab nitish kumaar kii krupa se jithan ram maanjhi mukhyamantri bane tab anant singh khuleam unke kilaaf jativaachak shabdon kaa prayog kar bayaan dete the
 When a grand alliance was formed with Lalu Yadav and under pressure, some Yadav boys were raided after the incident, the police team felt nothing and then the then Patna DIG Shalin told senior Superintendent of Police Vikas Vaibhav It was reprimanded that there was a raid on Anant Singh's house and weapons, if a few lakh rupees were not recovered, then it is not a shame
 unka ishaara saafe tha ki chhapemari kii khabar li kar di gai thi
 Later in the assembly elections, Independent Anand Singh won the election and this is now becoming a cause of misery for him
 anant singh ko yah galatafahami ho gai ki jab wo lalu or nitish ke mahagathbandhan ke kilaaf chunaav ladakar jeet sakate hai to wo sansad sadsy kyon nahin ban sakate or jis lalan singh kii chaaya main unka samrajya failaa tha usee ko unheen ko chunauti dene kii galati kar baithe
 But the truth is that as long as the government was pleased, the stock of arms lived in his Patna or his village
 yah baat police ke ucchadhikariyon ko bhi maaloom tha
 Former police officer Amitabh Lal Das made this complaint in writing
 lekin isaki sajaa unako puure kariyar main milti rahi
 Whatever action the police is taking against Anant Singh today, it certainly goes to the credit of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar who dared to take correct action against a Bahubali
 bhale hi iske peeche unke qareebi lalan singh hai jinhone chunaav main jeet ke baavjood ek nahin kai achche adhikariyon ko isliye tabadalaa karvaa diya kyonki chunaav ke dauraan unhone unki baat nahin maani
 But it should also be noted that Anant Singh did what came to mind by becoming Bahubali
 logon ko daraa dhamkaakar zamin or makaan par jabardastee kabja karte rahe or hatya ke bhi kai maamalon main batch gaye or in sab ke peeche nitish kumaar or lalan singh kaa hi varadahast tha

 pakistan ke pratibandhit aatankwaadi sanghathan jamaat ud daawa ke pramukh or 26 / 11 mumbai hamalon ke mukhya sajeeshkarta hafiz said se mulaakaat ke baad vivaadon main ghire ramdev ke kareebi or varisht patrkaar vedapratap vaidic ab kashmir par apane vivaadit bayaan ko lekar ghir gaye hai
 In an interview given to the Pakistani channel, Vedic said that if both Kashmiris are ready then there should be talk of independence
 29 june ko vedapratap vaidic ne don news ko die intervyuu main kaha tha ki donon kashmir taiyaar hon to unhen milakar aazaadee kii baat honi chahie
 However, now he is seen turning a bit from his interview
 vah kah rahe hai ki unhone aazaadee kii baat kahi he algaav kii nahin
 Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi also called Vedic an RSS man and demanded an inquiry into the entire matter
 is maamle ko lekar loksabhaa or rajyasabha main jamkar hangaamaa hua
 The opposition demanded the arrest of Vedic
 vittamantri arun jetali ne rajyasabha main kaha ki kashmir par aisa rukh rakhane waalon se hamaara koi sambandh nahin he
 Our stand on Kashmir is very clear
 vahiin videshmantri sushamaa swaraj ne loksabhaa main kaha ki vaidic kaa pakistan daura nijee tha
 The two leaders made it clear that the government had nothing to do with Ved Pratap Vedic's visit
 vahiin ramdev ne is maamle se pallaa jhaadte hue kaha ki vaidic maamle kii jaankaree media se mili
 He did not meet as my messenger
 vah ek swatantra patrkaar hai or kisi se bhi mil sakate hai
 On the other hand, Iftekhar Sharizi, the journalist who took the interview, made it clear that in Pakistan, Vedic expressed himself close to PM Modi
 sharizi ne yah bhi kaha ki unke mutabik, vaidic nijee daure par ye mulaakaaten nahin kar rahe the
 He also met Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif
 aise main yah nijee str kii mulaakaaten nahin ho saktin
 The RSS has also defeated Vedic in this matter
 ram madhav ne kaha he ki salmaan khurshid ke saath ghoomane vaale aresas
 He has no connection with the RSS
 salmaan khurshid ke saath ghoomane vaale aresas main nahin hote
 On the other hand, defense expert Sushant Sarin told NDTV in prime time that he had received such information from Pakistan that Vedic presented himself as close to Modi and his representative in Pakistan, although Vedic completely rejected it 
 isse purv somvaar ko hafiz said ke saath veda pratap vaidic kii mulaakaat kaa mudda sansad ke donon sadanon main uthaa or congress sadasyon ne patrkaar kii giraftaar tathaa sarkaar se is par jawaab die jane kii maang thi, jis par vittamantri arun jetali ko bhi safai deni padi thi
 At the same time, Vedic denied the Congress's allegations that he had met Hafiz as the messenger of the government
 vaidic ne kaha ki vah ‘kisi ke doot nahin he balki swayan ke doot hai
 Describing his meeting with Hafiz as correct, he said that he meets all kinds of people and it is a 'simple thing' for him

 shanivaar ko press conference kar nadda ne bataaya ki uma bharti ne chunaav na ladane kii ichha jaahir kii thi, jiske baad party ne unhen rashtriya upaadhyaksh banaaya he

 Rather she wants to work for the organization
 jiske baad rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne uma bharti ko party kaa rashtriya upaadhyaksh ghoshit kiya he
 Uma Bharti said on Friday that she did not want to contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections as she plans to go on a pilgrimage from May to 18 months
 saath hi unhone in khabaron ko bhi sire se khaarij kar diya tha ki vah jhaansi se nahin balki kisi surakshit seat se ladanaa chaahati hai
 Uma Bharti had said, 'I said in 2016 that i will not contest elections because i have to go to the pilgrimage places on the banks of the Ganges
 agar main chunaav ladati to main jhaansi se hi ladati
 i can never change my constituency
 vahaan ke logon ko mujh par garv he or vah mujhe apni beti jaisaa maanate hai
 Uma Bharatiuma, who will contest the general elections of 2024, also said that she will contest the general elections not in 2019 but in 2024, and under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the party will win a resounding majority
 isi ke saath unhone aagaamee chunaav na ladane ke apane faisle se bhaajapa mahasachiv (sanghathan) raamalaal ko avgat kara diya tha
 However, following his decision, Ramlal asked Uma Bharti to campaign for the party in the general election before going on a pilgrimage
 raamalaal ke aagrah par uma ne kaha ki vah 5 may tak bijepi ke liye chunaav prachaar karengi
 He said, 'the party has given me a lot from the post of Chief Minister to the post of Cabinet Minister
 maine bhaajapa ke adhyaksh pad ko chhod kar lagbhag sabhi sanghathanaatmak daayitv sanbhale hai
 It is my responsibility to not let the party feel ashamed
 main 5 may tak chunaav prachaar karuungi

 When you turn the pages of Ganga Maa, the new awe-inspiring photobook of Gulio Di Sturko, you will stumble upon a picture
 ek khubasurat tasviir main ek motaa aadmi pani ke pipe kii moti dhar se barf ko dur dhakelta prathit hota he
 He is not introduced to any of his photographs
 sturko spasht karte hai, ''tasviir maine dilli ke baahar khinchi thi
 And the thing that looks like an iceberg in the picture is actually pollution
 ''yamuna ke kinare sthit kaarkaanon se nadi main bahaae gaye rasinic kachare kaa jhaag itnaa chitratmak ho saktaa he, yah baat man ko pareshaan karti he
 "I love pictures that make an impact on different levels," says Di Sturko
 aap kisi aisi tasviir ko dekhnaa band kar dete hai jo pehle aapako bahut sundar lagati thi, to aap ek duusare str par pahunch jate hai
 i have tried to show that anything beautiful can have a different meaning
 '' us lihaaj se dekhen to ganga maa kii sabhi tasviren ek chalaavaran hai jinaki sachaai dahala dene vaali he
 While working as a freelance photo journalist for The New York Times, National Geographic and Le Mon in India for five years (2007–2012), Di Sturko felt that he needed to go deeper and see things
 ve kashmir main sainya jyadatiyon kii khinchi tasveeron se hi santusht na the
 "the picture says everything that can be said
" main kuch nahin kahana chahta
 i want people to see and decide what they want to see
 ''di sturko ab apni pahchaan ek documentry vijual arts photographer ke rup main bataate hai
 He started traveling to India in winter
 subah main, roshni maddhim thi
 The photographer knew that the sun had risen
 ve abhi ise dekh nahin sake
 "then you realize that it is not only winter fog, it is also pollution
" '' smog yani dhuaan mili kohre main khinchi gai ganga maa kii 90 pratishat se zyada tasviren badrang dikhti hai
 "when you look at the pictures of the Ganges drawn by Westerners, you see a lot of colors, lots of bathing people, and many aspects of religion," says Di Sturko
 beshak yah sab hota he, lekin ganga iske aage, usase kahin adhik he
 For him, Ganga is a metaphor full of contradictions
 ''yah mere liye avishwasaneey lagata he ki aap bina kisi pachhataave ke us nadi kii surat bigaadte ja rahe hai jise aap bahut pavitra maanate hai
 Ganga water is believed to have so much power that it can purify itself even when in reality it is not
 ''ganga maa kaa upsanhaar vandana shiva kaa ek niabandh he, india livs, iff ganga livs (ganga bachi to bharat bachegaa
 ) She reminds that if Gangotri glacier "shrinks", Ganga will become a seasonal river
 ''di sturko is pahalu par utana jor nahin dete
 Even though he did not want to follow a specific path along the banks of the river, he knew that without Gangotri, the talk of Ganga would be incomplete
 apni pehali yatra ke saat saal baad, ve ek aise sthaan par laute, jahaan unhone ek glacier kii tasviir lee thi par vah pigal chukaa tha
