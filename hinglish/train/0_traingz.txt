 The same Ram Madhav is telling after two months that the alliance is not worth running
 mufti sahab kii maut ke baad mahabuuba mufti ne kaaphi vakt liya gathbandhan banane ko magar wo ant main taiyaar ho gayi
 Everyone knows that the situation in Kashmir has deteriorated
 yah baat aap har kisi kii jubaan se sunenge
 The BJP should tell why the history of the coalition to which it was referring is a three-year history
 1 march 2015 main pradhanmantri kaa twit bhi usee itihaas ke khandhar se nikaal kar laayaa hum jahaan ye gathbandhan ab dafan kar diya gaya he
 Kashmir will be ruled by the Governor
 kis party ke paas kitni sankhya he ise lekar kiya jane vaala jod ghataav itane bhar ke liye he taaki channelon ke screen ko vyast rakhaa jaae
 NN Vohra will run Kashmir
 congress or ensi ne saaf kar diya he ki ve is daud main nahin hai
 Neither shall we form a government with each other nor with anyone else
 bemail gathbandhan kahana thik nahin he, agar yah bemail hota to teen saal nahin chalata
 It is not that there were no challenges during this time
 wo kaaphi thim gathbandhan ke tut jane ke liye magar tab bhi sarkaar chalati rahi
 Even when the stone-pelting was at its peak, the situation had become uncontrollable
 din raat news channelon par isaki tasviren chalati thim or hindi pradeshon main raay banaai jaati thi
 But the stones were telling that the situation was uncontrollable
 avishvaas kii khai chaudee hoti ja rahi he
 Then in February this year, a news secretly comes out that between 2008 and 2017, 11,000 people were booked for stonewalling, most of them are withdrawn
 2016 ke saal main jab patharbaji charam par thi tab kai hazaar log giraftaar hue the
 On June 7, 2018, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said in Jammu and Kashmir Sports Conclave that all the cases of stone pelting against children would be withdrawn
 iskaa matlab he ki patharbazon se mukadmaa waapas lene ke maamle main centre or rajya sarkaar ek saath soch samaj kar aage bad rahe the
 Ram Madhav has also said the same thing
 30 april 2018 ko pitiai se jari ram madhav kaa ek intervyuu bhi aap dekh sakate hai jisamen ve kehete hai ki pehali baar pathar phenkane waalon rajya sarkaar ne grahamantralay se baat kar maafee di he
 Meanwhile, you will remember that a Major Gogai enters the scene, tying a Farooq Ahmed Dar on his jeep and making a shield
 yah maamla bhi kaaphi vivaadit hui or sena kii bahaduree or sarkaar ke majboot iraadon kii tarif kii gai
 On May 23 this year, Major Gogai is allegedly caught with a minor girl in a hotel and the army orders a court of inquiry against them
 in do udaahranon se dekh sakate hai ki jin muddon ko lekar hindi pradeshon kii raajnneetik soch ko ek khaas saanche main dhaalane kii koshish kii gai unka ant kis tarah se hota he
 One thing remained in the midst of all these challenges, that PDP BJP government
 kathua balaatkaar ke maamle main bhi yah gathbandhan tikaa rahaa, jabaki mahabuuba ke kehane par bijepi ke do matriyon ko hataanaa padaa tha
 Who were gathering in favor of the rape accused
 agar in do mantriyon par mahabuuba kaa bas chalata to ye aaropee ke paksh main sabha main jate hi nahin
 On the same Mehbooba Chakar could not put the name of Major Aditya Kumar in the FIR in Shopian case, while she had tweeted and ordered a magistrate inquiry
 zaahir he donon ko hi jhukna padaa or donon saath bhi chalate rahe
 Ram Madhav very easily described Mehbooba as the main leadership of the coalition but it is also a matter of debate how much leadership was in Mehbooba's hands
 kashmir ko kareeb se jaanane vaale telegraph india ke sankarshan thakur ne apane lekh main likhaa he ki mahabuuba naam kii mukhiya thim
 They are just puppets
 7 may kaa unka lekh hai aap pard sakate hai
 Mehbooba also said that she would not try to form a government
 magar unhone apane press conference main bijepi kii aalochana nahin kii
 This much said that the muscular policy i
e
 arm twisting policy will not work
 donon pakshon ke bayaan ko sun kar lagata he ki gathbandhan banane main jaisi sahmati thi, waisi hi sahmati tuutane ko lekar bhi he
 There was no significant bitterness
 kisi ne nahin kaha ki hamaari peeth main chura bhonka gaya he
 Rather, such a big decision was announced with restrained words from both sides
 pradhanmantri ke liye kashmir koi anjaan jagah nahin he
 The comments 2014 ke baad kashmir main die gaye unke sabhi bhaashanon ko padhie, main chaar paanch bhaashan padhe
 There is no indication of Kashmir's policy in them, but only about development
 kashmir main apane bhaashanon main pradhanmantri kabhi bataanaa nahin bhoolatey ki vahaan kaaryakarta ke rup main rahe hai, ilaake ko jaanate hai
 Yet in his speeches he was never directly heard speaking on the root problem of Kashmir
 unke har bhaashan main vikaas paryaton, saura urja kaa istamaal, ring road, tunnel jaisi bate hai
 The entire speech was about the inauguration of the schemes and their benefits
 ek bhaashan main ve atal bihari vaajapeyi kii kashmir niti ki baat karte hai
 Atal ji used to say that Jammu and Kashmir has to be taken to new heights on the three strong pillars of human Kashmiri and Jamhooriyat
 phir pradhanmantri modi yah bhi jod dete hai ki hamane vaajapeyi ji sapane ke andar sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas kaa rang bhar diya he
 In a speech, he praises Mehbooba Mufti for how excited he is about development
 kashmir ke halaat par do log bahes karte hai
 One who closely observes Kashmir, constantly observes, keeps writing, and the other is those who do not understand the need to know anything about Kashmir, but the irony is that the politics set about Kashmir is based on this other section Opinion dominates the most
 kashmir main rajyapal kaa shashan hoga
 The addition subtraction to be done by which party has the number is so much so that the screens of the channels are kept busy
 enen vohara kashmir chalaayenge
 Congress and NC have made it clear that they are not in this race
 na aapas main or na kisi or ke saath milakar sarkaar nahin banaaenge
 It is not right to say mismatched alliance, if it was mismatched, it would not have lasted for three years
 aisi baat nahin he ki is dauraan chunautiyaan nahin ain
 She was enough to break the alliance, but still the government continued
 tab bhi chali jab patharbazi charam par thi, halaat bekaabu ho chale the
 It used to run pictures on news channels day and night and opinion was made in Hindi states
 magar patharbazi ke drishy bataa rahe the ki halaat bekaabu hai
 The gap of mistrust is widening
 phir isi saal farvari 2018 main ek khabar chupake se aakar chali jaati he ki 2008 se 2017 ke bich 11,000 logon ke khilaaf patharbazi karne ke mukademe darj the, un sabase mukadmaa waapas liya jaataa he
 Thousands of people were arrested in the year 2016 when the stone pelting was at its peak
 isi 7 june 2018 ko grahamantri rajnath singh ne jammu kashmir sports kanklev main kaha tha ki bacchon ke khilaaf patharbazi karne ke jitne bhi cese kiye gaye the unhen waapas liya jayega
 This means that the Central and State Governments were proceeding thoughtfully together in the matter of withdrawing the case from the stone pelters
 yahi baat ram madhav bhi kah chuke hai
 You can also see an interview of Ram Madhav released from PTI on 30 April 2018 in which he says that for the first time the state government has given an apology by talking to the Home Ministry
 isi bich aapako yaad hoga ki ek major gogai seen main pravesh karte hai, apni jeep par ek faruk ahamed daar ko baandh kar dhaal bana lete hai
 The matter was also disputed and the bravery of the army and the strong intentions of the government were praised
 isi saal 23 may main major gogai ko ek hotel main kathith rup se naaballig ladki ke saath pakadaa jaataa he or inke khilaaf sena court aaf inquairi ke aadesh detii he
 From these two examples, you can see how the issues on which the political thinking of the Hindi territories was tried in a particular mold ends
 in tamaam chunautiyon ke bich ek chiz tiki rahi to wo pidipi bijepi kii sarkaar
 In the case of Kathua rape, this alliance remained intact, while two BJP ministers had to be removed at the behest of Mehbooba
 jo balaatkaar ke aaropee ke paksh main sabha kar rahe the
 If Mehbooba's bus would have gone on these two ministers, they would not have gone to the assembly in favor of the accused
 vahi mahabuuba chaahakar par shopiyaan maamle main major aditya kumaar kaa naam exiaar main nahin daal pain, jabaki ve twit kar magistrate jaanch ke aadesh de chuki thi
 Obviously both had to bend and both continued to walk together
 ram madhav ne bahut aasaani se mahabuuba ko gathbandhan kaa mukhya netritv qaraar de diya magar yah bhi bahes kaa mudda he ki mahabuuba ke haath main kitna netritv tha
 Sankarshan Thakur of Telegraph India, who knows Kashmir closely, has written in his article that there was a chief named Mehbooba
 ve bas kathputlati rah gayi hai
 His article is May 7, you can read
 mahabuuba ne bhi kaha ki ve sarkaar banane kaa prayaas nahin karengi
 But he did not criticize the BJP in his press conference
 itnaa hi kaha ki muscular policy yani baanh marodane vaali niti nahin chalegi
 Hearing the statements of both the parties, it seems that the same agreement was there to break the consensus
 koi khaas katutaa nazar nahin ai
 Nobody said that we got stabbed in our back
 balki itane bade faisle kaa elaan donon taraf se sanyam bhare shabdon ke saath hua
 Kashmir is not an unknown place for the Prime Minister
 tippaniyan Read all his speeches given in Kashmir after 2014, i read four to five speeches
 unamem kashmir kii niti kaa koi sanket nahin miltaa he, bas vikaas kii bate hai
 In his speeches in Kashmir, the Prime Minister never forgets to tell that he has been there as an activist, knows the area
 phir bhi apane bhaashanon main kabhi sidhe taur par kashmir kii mul samasya par bolte nahin suna
 In his speech, development has been talked about like tourism, use of solar energy, ring road, tunnel
 puraa bhaashan yojanaon ke shilanyas udghaatan or unke phaayde ko lekar hota tha
 In a speech, he talks about Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Kashmir policy
 atal ji kehete the ki insaniyar kashmiriyat or jamhuriyat ke teen majboot khambhon par jammu kashmir ko nai oonchaaiyon par le janaa he
 Then Prime Minister Modi also adds that within the dream of Vajpayeeji, we have filled the color of everyone's development with everyone
 ek bhaashan main ve mahabuuba mufti kii jamkar tarif karte hai ki kis tarah ve vikaas ko lekar utsahit hai
 Two people debate the situation in Kashmir
 ek jo kashmir ko kareeb se dekhte hai, lagaataar dekhte rahete hai, likhte rahete hai or duusare wo log hai jo kashmir par kuch jaanane kii zarurat nahin samajhate magar vidambnaa yah he ki kashmir ko lekar jo raajnneeti set hoti he us par isi duusare tabake kii raay sabase zyaada haaavee hoti he

 At the same time, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, the chairman of the moderate Hurriyat Conference, condemned the detention of JKLF chief Yasin Malik and raided the leaders of jamaat-e-islami Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha, ‘jamaat-e-islamic netritv or iske kaaryakartaaon par raat main hui karrwai or yasin malik kii giraftaar kii kadi ninda karata hum
 Such illegal and drastic measures against Kashmiris are meaningless and will not change the realities on the ground

 sansad kaa monsoon satr 18 july yani buudhvaar se shuru ho rahaa he or is baar sabaki nazren rajyasabha ke upasabhapati ke liye hone vaale chunaav par hongi
 Both Congress and BJP want to see their candidate for this post, but the mathematics of the seats is such that none of them are able to win any candidate on their own
 aise main endie or upie main in badi partiyon ke sahyogi dalon ne bhi is pad par apni nigahen gada di hai
 Till now, big parties have also indicated to show big heart in this matter
 khabar he ki congress ensipi yani rashtravaadi congress party ko ye pad ofer kar sakati he
 In the race for the post, NCP Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman PJ Kurien's term ended on July 1 and the monsoon session is scheduled to begin in a few days
 lihaaja nae upasabhapati ko lekar raajnneetik guna-ganit kaa khel shuru ho chukaa he
 There are indications from the Congress that it will not field its candidate, but may offer the post of Deputy Chairman to NCP
 is prastaav par vipakshi dalon kii hone vaali ranneetik baithak main charchaa ho sakati he
 Actually Congress wants to show that she has a 'big heart'
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav tak uske liye vipaksh ko ekajute rakhana jaruri he isiilie party chaahati he ki upasabhapati kaa pad wo kisi sahyogi dal ko ofer kare or isamen ensipi use sabase mufeed lagati he
 Significantly, NCP is an old ally of Congress
 donon milakar centre or maharashtra main sarkaar chalaa chuke hai
 The two parties contested separate elections in the 2014 assembly elections, which resulted in the loss of power
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main ensipi kam siten ladakar bhi congress se adhik siten jeetne main safal rahi thi
 The Congress could win only two seats by contesting 27 seats, while NCP managed to win four seats by contesting 21 seats
 vaise congress ke ensipi ko upasabhapati kii seat dene ke peeche ek kaaran or he
 It is said that upa's allies and other regional parties have clearly told them that they want to come on one platform not to win the Congress but to defeat the BJP
 congress ke liye chunautiaise main congress ke paas simit vikalp hai
 Either it should support Mamata Banerjee's TMC in this matter, who have no good record of working with Congress
 wo upie-2 kii sarkaar se bich main hi samarthan waapas le chuki thim
 Also in the assembly elections in West Bengal, instead of Banerjee, the Congress was an ally of his anti-left parties
 khud mamata abhi tak mahagathbandhan yaa fedral front ke bich jhul rahi hai or rahul gandhi ke piem pad ke ummidavaar hone par bhi unka rukh ab tak saaf nahin he
 In such a situation, the Congress seems to have a more alternative option under which a relatively loyal party like NCP has to offer the post of Deputy Chairman
 hindustan times kii report ke mutabik ensipi ke ek netaa ne sweekaar kiya he ki congress ne anaupchaarik rup se is silsile main party se baat kii he
 But nothing concrete has come up in this regard yet
 is netaa ne kaha ki unki party congress or anya vipakshi dalon ke bich sethu kaa kaam karnaa chaahati he
 'congress will feel more comfortable with us than the candidate of Trinamool Congress, other smaller parties will also be more comfortable with NCP than Congress
 'bataa den ki somvaar ko hone vaali vipakshi dalon kii baithak kii adhyakshata rajyasabha main netaa pratipaksh gulam nabi aaazaad karenge
 In this, the opposition's strategy will be prepared for the monsoon session
 baithak main tidipi ne modi sarkaar ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav ke samarthan ko lekar bhi koi faisla ho saktaa he

 Stating that everyone has equal rights over water, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan has said that water will not be privatized in the state and a law will be made to save the ponds
 chouhan ne yahaan pani ko lekar yojit kaaryshaala ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki pradesh main har gaanv or shahar kii apni jal sanrachana ho, iskaa abhiyaan chalaaya jayega
 He said that everyone has the right over water and it will not be privatized
 desh main nadiyon ke punerjeevan ko badi chunauti bataate hue chouhan ne kaha ki pradesh main narmada ko pradooshan mukt kar adarsh nadi banane kii yojana banaayi ja rahi he
 He said that it should be considered whose development should be done and at whose cost
 bhu-jal kii apni simaaen hai
 The problem of water shortage has arisen due to not recharging it
 unhone kaha ki pradesh main chalaaye gayi jalabhishek abhiyaan main saat lakh se adhik jal sanrachanaayen banaayi gayi hai or ise janandolan kaa rup diya gaya he
 He informed that the work of reviving a river has also been started in every district
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki kheton main daale jane vaale rasinic khaad se bhi jal pradooshit hota he
 He said that with the increase in agricultural production, we will also have to worry about this pollution for the purity of water
 iske liye jaivik khaad kaa upyog badhanaa hoga
 Describing the question of sewage treatment as important, Chauhan said that a limit campaign has been launched to curb open defecation in the state
 ab shahari swatchta mishan bhi shuru kiya ja rahaa he
 a scheme to connect the old ponds of Bundelkhand with rivers has also been started
 unhone kaha ki prakruti kaa shoshan nahin balki dohan hona chaiye
 As much should be taken from nature as it can compensate
 unhone kaha ki bade shaharon main shuddh pani uplabdh karwaanaa hamaari praathamikta he
 Presenting their survey report, Director General of Center for Science and Environment at the program said that a city which does not think about its water and its drainage cannot save its rivers and ponds
 unhone kaha ki aane vaale samay main pani kii zarurat or badhegi
 There is no scarcity of water in the cities but there is disparity in distribution and the loss of water is more
 The cities which save their ponds in the country are very few, while the urban bodies are not paying attention to sewage treatment
 sunita narayan ne kaha ki saaf pani par sabakaa haq he uske liye afordable water supplai kii baat karnaa hogi, jo shahar varsha ke pani kii chintaa nahin karegaa batch nahin paaegaa

 For the first time in the country, a religious leader has started making films
 'jurrat' shabd kaa istemaal isliye kiya gaya he, kyonki hamaare desh m mana jaataa he ki dharmaguruon ko naachna-gaanaa yaa rock concert karnaa shobhaa nahin detaa
 It is not that rock concerts or films are not released in the country
 sab hota he, lekin dharmaguru kare, to is par vivaad hona tay he, kyonki sabhi deshavaasiyon ke dharmaguru yaa 'god main' kah lijie, ek nahin hai
 According to tradition and faith in every house, there is a recognition of Guru or not
 ab is baat ke chalate kisi dharmaguru dwaara puure desh main apni film kaa prachaar karnaa jaahir-si baat he ki un logon ko raas nahin aayega, jo unhen nahin maanate
 It is being talked about by Gurmeet Ram Rahim, the head of 'dera Sacha Sauda', whose film 'MSG - The Messenger of God' was to be released on January 16, but the Sensor Board banned the film
 sensor board kaa kahana he ki is film main deraa pramukh ne khud ko bhagwaan bataaya he
 However, the Dera chief has often denied this in interviews
 unka kahana he ki unhone film main khud ko bhagwaan ke doot ke rup main pesh kiya he, na ki bhagwaan ke rup main
 The trailer of this film shows Bhidera Pramukh with a dialogue
 dialog he- ' karwaane vaale to wo allaa, vaahe guru, god, ram hai, ham to sirf ek insaan hai
 'well, whatever the reason behind the ban on this film, but this film should be released
 isaki bhi kai vajah lagaataar soshal cites par apadet kii ja rahi hai
 Here are five reasons why the film should be released: 1
 is film ko banane kaa sabase bada makasad desh main thilacemia se grast logon kii madad karnaa bataaya ja rahaa he
 To help the poor people who are unable to afford the disease from the film's earnings
 2
 In an interview given by the Dera chief about this film, he has mentioned many times that his film is a dedicate for Youngsters
 unka maananaa he ki desh kii yuva peedi drugs or kai tarah ke nashon main lipt he
 This will lead them to adopt the same path to get them out and to convey this message to them, as Youngsters are more interested in watching a 3-hour film than a 3-hour satsang
 isliye is film ko ek madhyam ke taur par chunaa gaya he
 Dera Chief hopes that the film will have an impact on the Youngsters and he will stay away from things like drugs

 The film has been produced by Bollywood director Jeetu Arodane
 film kii roak par bollywood diarector mahesh bhatta dwaara bhi bayaan jari kiya gaya he
 Mahesh Bhatt has said in an interview given to a Hindi newspaper that this film will definitely get justice
 film industry main jo log rachanaatmak swatantraaa ko lekar or abhivyakti kii aazaadee ke liye jhande lekar khadey ho jate hai ve 'massenger of god' kii relies rukne par kyon khamosh baithe hai? unhone kaha jo vyakti 'pike' or 'haidar' kii aazaadee ke liye ladata he, uskaa ferj he ki vah 'MSG' jaisi film ke liye bhi laden
 It is not right that you selectively stand for films
 unhone kaha, 'bhale hi aap film banane vaale vyakti se sahamat na hon, magar use adhikaar he ki vah apni film dikhaae
 If we say that what we said is amazing and the other is not right, then it is double-handedness
 '4
 It has been reported on the film's Facebook page that the film carries the message of about 15 acts of humanity and goodness
 isse log prerit hokar insaaniyat ke raste ko akhriyaar karenge
 5
 is film ko lekar twitor par yah hashtag # isupportmsg top trend main jagah banaae hue he
 On this Twitter page called isupportmsg, the film should be released and why are the reasons being given for it
 inamen se ek vajah bataai gai he- 'kyonki yah ek anti drug film he, isliye drug mafia se sensor board dar rahaa he
 ' # releaseourmsg # isupportmsg @ narendramodiwhy censor board trying 2 ban anti drug movie? Fearing drug mafia? "- ekuinsa # isupportmsg (@ektainsan) January 15, 2015 # isupportmsg @ pmoindia @ narendramodimsg is a movie which is against the alcohal and drugs, it gives gud lesson to youth

 Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid said that the Prime Minister will take the final decision regarding the meeting
 videsh sachiv sujatha singh ne kaha, pradhanmantri kaa kaarykram abhi antim rup die jane kii prakriya main he
 According to her, she could not tell whether the meeting would take place or not
 samvaadadaataaon ne sujatha se poocha tha ki kya donon pradhanmantri is maheene ke aakhir main neuyork main sanyukt raashtra mahasabha se itar mulaakaat karenge
 Manmohan Singh will leave for the US on 25 September and will stay in New York from 27 to 30 September
 khurshid ne pitiai se kaha, ham kai chizon ko lekar chintit hai, jo hamane pichley kuch samay main pakistan ko bataa di hai
 We should get satisfaction
 ham chaahate hai ki kuch kaam ho
 We want indications that what we have told them is serious
 tippaniyan When the Foreign Minister was asked if Manmohan and Sharif would meet, he said, "it is an important point to destroy the terror structure
" mumbai main (26 november, 2008 ko) jo hua, uske liye javabdehi bhi ek anya mahatvapurn bindu he
 There should be at least some beginning
 jab videsh sachiv sujatha singh ke saamne is baat kaa zikr kiya gaya ki sharif ne haal hi main sakaaratmak bayaan die hai, to unhone pradhanmantri ke hawaale se kaha ki abhi kuch katu jamini vaastaviktaaen hai
 Sujatha said, "the harsh ground reality means that we are constantly facing terrorist activities on behalf of organizations operating from Pakistan and from areas controlled by Pakistan
" unhone kaha, kai log bharat ke khilaaf virdohi dushprachaar main bhi shaamil hai, jo pakistan main khuleam ghoomte rahete hai
 Despite repeated commitments and very positive statements from the highest level in Pakistan, there has been little progress in efforts to punish those responsible for the Mumbai attacks
 yah katu sachai hai
 Let's see what happens
 videsh mantri salmaan khurshid ne kaha ki mulaakaat ke sambandh main antim nirnay pradhanmantri lenge
 Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh said, the Prime Minister's program is in the process of being finalized
 unke mutabik vah nahin bataa saktin ki mulaakaat hogi yaa nahin
 The reporters had asked Sujatha whether the two Prime Ministers would meet on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York later this month
 manmohan singh 25 sitambar ko america ke liye ravaanaa honge or 27 se 30 sitambar tak neuyork main rahenge
 Khurshid told PTI, "we are worried about many things, which we have told Pakistan in the recent past
" hamen santosh milanaa chahie
 We want some work done
 ham is baat ke sanket chaahate hai ki hamane unhen jo bataaya he, un par gambhirtha he
 The comments videsh mantri se jab poocha gaya ki kya manmohan or sharif mulaakaat karenge, to unhone kaha, aatanki dhaanche ko nestanabood karnaa ek ahm bindu he
 Accountability is also another important point for what happened in Mumbai (on 26 November 2008)
 kam se kam kuch shuruyaat honi chahie
 When it was mentioned in front of Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh that Sharif had recently given positive statements, he quoted the Prime Minister as saying that there are some harsh ground realities right now
 sujatha ne kaha, katu jamini vaastaviktaa se aashay he ki ham pakistan se gatividhiyaan chalaa rahe sanghathanon kii ore se or pakistan ke niyantran vaale kshetron se aatankwaadi gatividhiyon kaa lagaataar saamana kar rahe hai
 He said, many people are also involved in anti-propaganda against India, who roam freely in Pakistan
 pakistan main sarvocch str se baar-baar patibaddhtaon or bahut sakaaratmak bayanon ke baavjood mumbai hamalon ke liye jimmedaar logon ko dandit karne ke prayaason main bahut kam pragati hui he
 This is a harsh truth
 dekhte hai kya hota he
 Manmohan Singh will leave for the US on 25 September and will stay in New York from 27 to 30 September
 khurshid ne pitiai se kaha, ham kai chizon ko lekar chintit hai, jo hamane pichley kuch samay main pakistan ko bataa di hai

 When finance experts like Manmohan Singh, p Chidambaram tried to say the same till yesterday, then they were tried to call them crazy, but now only bjp's former finance minister Yashwant Sinha has thrown the wind of development
 desh kii vikaas dar 5
 It is said to be 7 percent whereas in reality it is 3
 7 fisadi he
 After making this claim, Yashwant Sinha can also be considered dishonest or a traitor
 rashia main stalin raaj ke khilaaf bolne vaale ek-ek raat main gaayab ho jate hai
 What punishment Yashwant Sinha gets for speaking the truth will have to be seen
 saamana ne aage likhaa he ki sinha agar galat he to siddh karo ki unke dwaara lagaae gaye aarope jhuthe hai
 Many people of BJP are resentful of the falling economy, but due to unintentional fear, no one is ready to speak
 desh kaa bahut bada nuksaan ho rahaa he
 The editorial further states that Sinha is not an Arre Garre, he was the Finance Minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, so his statement cannot prove to be an offshoot of paid salaried campaigners on social media alone
 sampadakeey main daawa kiya gaya he ki ye sab hamane saal bhar pehle kah diya tha tab ham deshadrohi tehraae gaye the
 Now Yashwant Sinha will be appointed

 It is believed that India will send a diplomatic note to Islamabad to question how Lakhvi deposited 10 lakh rupees on two sureties and who came forward for these sureties
 aadhikarik sutron ne kaha ki bhartiya suraksha pratishthan ko andeh he ki shaayad iesai ne muchalke kii raashi kaa intjaam kiya jisase lakhvi kii rihaai sunishchit ho sake
 India has already demanded the intervention of the United Nations over Lakhvi's release
 bharat kaa kahana he ki uski rihaai sanyukt raashtra ke niyamon kaa ulanghan he or is vishwa nikaay ko yah mudda pakistan ke samaksh uthaanaa chahie
 Lakhvi was released by the Adiala Jail Administration on April 10 following an order from the Lahore High Court

 From input language aaj main us technology ke bare main baat karnaa chahta hum jo na keval bharat main badlaav laaegi, balki uskaa kayakalp kar degi
 Technology has been guiding the progress of human civilization for hundreds of years
 lekin praudyogiki aakhir he kya? yah ve aujaar or tareeke hai jinhen insaan ne chizon ko behatar tareeke se karne ke liye ek vaigyanik soch kaa istemaal karke ijad kiya
 Technology helps in increasing productivity, higher value addition and mastering economic growth and all these together contribute to thriving and empowering the society
 har praudyogikeey kranti khel ke niyamon ko nae sire se garh detii he
 Those who take initiative in it, their hands get a chance to gain global leadership, strength and influence
 duniya ne kai praudyogikeey krantiyaan dekhi hai, lekin zyaadaatar main bharat haashie par hi rahaa he
 Especially in the field of infrastructure and manufacturing, we have missed many opportunities to go further
 aaj duniya ek or audyogic kranti ke muhane par he—jab bhautik, digital or jaivik vigyaan kaa sangam ho rahaa he
 This will help humanity to revisit all aspects of life, make new discoveries and give them a new look
 mobile internet, cloud computing, kritrim intelegence, robotics, naino-praudyogiki or jinomix is kranti kii buniyadi praudyogikiyaan hai
 Billions of people and sensors bring a tsunami of data every moment, which can be understood in the cloud through powerful software and calculations (allogrists) and then create magical experiences for consumers, solving the complex problems of society And new ways of value addition can be adopted

 We are in the dawn of a new era of humanism and this is an opportunity which India should accept with open arms
 yuva bharattechnology ke bare main sabase mjedaar baat yah he ki vah sabko barabari par laa detii he, vah kisi jati, sampradaay yaa dharm ko nahin maanati
 i believe that India can play a leading role in this new revolution
 iske liye mere paas chaar kaaran hai
 First, India is a young nation and 63% of its population is under 35 years of age
 jeeyo main, maine dekha he ki yuva kis tej gati se technology ko apanaate hai
 In 2014, India was ranked 154th in the world in broadband mobile penetration and by 2029 it will be one of the top three countries in the world
 duusare, ab tak digital kaa abhaav or aitihaasik technology dhaancha bhi darasal billi ke bhaag se chhinka footne jaisaa he
 Not having a traditional technology base means that we can directly adopt the next generation, bypassing many generations of technology, and can overtake even the most advanced countries of the world in one stroke
 tisare, bharat apane sabhi nagarikon ko vaishvik internet se jodgaye kii raah par he

 sutron ke anusaar, 'in companiyon ne kaha ki sibar apradhi network hack karne or mahatvapurn suchanaaen churaane ke liye apane taur-tareekon ko bahut teji se badal rahe hai
 Due to this, governments around the world have to update their laws so that they can work according to the changing methods
 bharat is lihaaj se bahut apadet nahin he
 ' sutron ne kaha ki bharat main sibar suraksha kanoon kaa majboot khaakaa hone se yahaan ke naagarik soochnaaon kii chori, sibar utpeedan, audyogic jasusi jaise muddon ko dirghakaalik str par nipta sakate hai
 Government officials said that the Minister of Communications and IT has assured the Japanese delegation that the government is very serious about cyber security and is working towards strengthening the laws
 japan ne bharat main isiti sahit vibhinn kshetron main nivesh karne kii ichha jataai he
 Significantly, when Japan's Trade and Industry Minister Yoichi Miyazawa visited India last week, he was accompanied by officials of these companies in his delegation

 The Justice Verma Committee, formed after the Delhi gang rape, has submitted its report
 bharat ke purv pradhan nyaayadhish nyaayamurti je es verma ne mahilaon ke khilaaf badhate aparaadh ke liye sarkaar or system ko jamkar latada he
 He has also drawn the Home Secretary and the Delhi Police over the Delhi gang rape
 tees dinon kii miyaad khatm hone se ek din pehle hi justise je es verma kamity ne apni report grih mantralay ko saunp di
 In its report, Justice Verma Committee suggested that the current punishment under the laws related to crime against women needs to be further tightened
 lekin justise verma kamity ne sajaa-e-maut kaa suzav nahin diya he
 The Justice Verma Committee has suggested that under sections 376 (1), 376 (2) and 376 (3) the convict should be kept in the jail
 dhara 376 (C) yani gangrape ke maamle main bhi doshi ko taumr jail main rakhaa jaae
 The committee has recommended adding new section 376 (f) under which the responsibility of administrative or army officer will also be fixed in case of sexual offenses
 cameti ne dhara 375, 376 or 509 ke tahat sajaa ke praavdhaan ko 7 saal se lekar 20 tak karne kii sifarish kii he
 But Justice Verma Committee has not suggested punishment-a-death
 dilli gangrape cese ke baad naaballig kii umr kya ho- is sawaal par khub bavaal machaa lekin justise verma kamity ne naaballig kii umr main badlaav kii koi sifarish nahin kii he
 Justice Verma Committee has also lambasted the police-administration and the government for the Delhi gang rape case
 kaha ki kanoon main badlaav par desh videsh se 8 xxrep 4 0 suzav aae lekin shaayad hi kisi police pramukh ne suzav bheja
 There are also less suggestions from government departments 
 justise verma ne sarkaar ko suzav die ki jaanch agenciyon ko sarkari shikanje se aaazaad kiye jane kii darkaar he
 Justice Verma has questioned the Delhi Police over the Delhi gang rape case
 unhone kaha ki unhen hairaani hui ki jab maafee maangane kaa vakt tha tab grih sachiv dilli police kamishnar kii peeth thapthapa rahe the
 The committee recommended that intentionally touching and touching a person being of a sexual nature and against the consent of the person being touched should be considered as sexual violence by law
 samiti ne kisi ke liye dhamkee bhare shabd yaa bhav bhangima, kisi ladki kaa peechha karnaa, maanav taskari or yon ichha ke chalate ghurne sahit kai naye tarah ke aapraadhik krityon ko lekar sajaa kaa prastaav kiya he
 The committee has proposed a punishment of three to seven years in case of assaulting a woman with the intention of disarming her
 samiti ne un police adhikariyon ke liye kade dand kaa praavdhaan karne kii sifarish kii he jo shikaayat ke baad balaatkaar yaa yon utpedan kaa maamla panjikrut nahin karte
 The committee has proposed a ten-year sentence for military or police officers who failed to control rape subordinates
 mahilaon kii suraksha ko lekar taiyaar report kaa ullekh karte hue verma ne mahatma gandhi or arestu kaa ullekh kiya
 He advocated changes in education and social behavior
 saath hi kaha ki kanoonon kaa anupaalan nahin kar paane ke liye sheersh police adhikariyon ko javabdeh banaaya janaa chahie
 Also suggested good governance like installing more street lights
 khap panchayaton ko aade haath lete hue samiti ne kaha ki jo rukh khap panchayatein apanaati hai, vah tarkahin str par pahunch gaya he
 The committee asked the government to ensure that such institutions do not interfere with the choice made by the people in the matter of marriage
 samiti ne kaha ki mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh ke pariprekshya main khap panchayaton ke rukh par vichaar karnaa praasangik tha
 Varma said that the logic of maintaining the caste system by Khap panchayats snatches away the freedom of a person to choose his partner independently
 verma ne kaha ki ham sarkaar se ummid karte hai ki vah sunishchit kare ki khap panchayaton jaisi sanstha shaadi ke maamle main kisi purush yaa mahila kii pasand ko lekar hastkshep na karen
 The committee said that the victims of murder for false pride are becoming largely women
 aise main is saamaajik buraai par vichaar karnaa samiti ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn tha
 The Justice Verma Committee is hopeful that in as few days as they have done the work of giving suggestions to the government, the government will also take a decision on those suggestions and implement them in less time

 If Team India wins in Mohali, then its ranking can rise from fourth to third
 team main match finisher kaa role koun nibhaayega ise lekar bhi sawaal bade hai lekin hardik pandya ab tak team ke kai bade sawaalon kaa jawaab banate nazar aaye hai
 This is the first ODI series for 23-year-old Hardik Himanshu Pandya of Gujarat, but in the first two odis, he has shown the potential of a very experienced player
 dilli ke match main jis vakt unhen finisher kaa role adaa karne kaa mauqaa mila
 At that time, the squads of Team India had returned and the fans too
 team india ke match main vaapasi kii ummid kho chuke the
 But with the lower-order batsmen scoring 36 off 32 balls, he gained the trust of the team management
 pandya 49wein over main out hue
 The match went to the 50th over and the victory slipped from India's hands
 kiwi team sirf 6 ranon se jeet hasil kar pai
 Pandya proved to be the hero of the match by taking 3 wickets in his first ODI, while in the second ODI, he spent 45 runs in 9 overs and won his heart with his bat
 ab tak khele gaye 16 first class maichon main unke naam 5 ardhshtkeey paariyaan hai
 While 3 out of 16 first class matches

 Former captain Sunil Gavaskar believes that there has been a lot of improvement in Pandya and hence great expectations can be expected from him
 NDTV se baat karte hue purv captain sunil gavaskar kehete hai 'hardik pandya ek fost bowler olerounder kii kami ko puraa karte nazar aate hai
 Players often go astray when new successes are found
 ye pandya ke saath pichley saal ho chuke he lekin ab vah acchhee gendbaazi kar rahe hai
 His focus is visible
 ipel main wo bade chakke lagaate dekhe gaye hai
 Comments captain dhoni series kii shuruyaat se hi pandya ko parakhane kii baat kah chuke hai
 Pandya has been seen to impress everyone so far with the results of his examination
 emes dhoni ne dharmashala vanade ke baad kaha tha 'champions trophy se pehle hamaare paas 8 game hai
 So we would like to see how they perform under different circumstances
 agar vah acha pradarshan karte rahe to koi vajah nahin hogi ki ham unhen team ke pehle teen gendbaazon ke rup main unka chunaav nahin karen
 In the short format game, Pandya has been showing his power
 saiyad mushtak ali trophy (2015-16 kii gharelu tii20 ) main pandya ne 10 maichon main sabase zyaada 377 ran banaae or 10 wicket jatke jo sabit karata he ki unamem tej gendwaz olerounder banane kaa puraa dam he

 Many people consider him a rising star of Team India
 lekin nichle kram ke ballebaazon ke saath 32 gendon par 36 ran banaakar unhone team management kaa bharosa hasil kar liya
 Pandya was dismissed in the 49th over

 He has 5 half-century innings in 16 first class matches played so far
 jabaki 16 first class maichon main unhone 3
 There are 22 wickets with an economy of 13
 purv captain sunil gavaskar maanate hai ki pandya main pehle se bahut sudhaar aayaa he or isliye unase badi ummiden kii ja sakati hai
 Speaking to NDTV, former captain Sunil Gavaskar says, 'hardik Pandya seems to be filling the lack of a fast bowler all-rounder
 jab nai kamyaabi milti he to aksar khilaadi bhatak jate hai
 He has been with Pandya last year but now he is bowling well
 unka fokas nazar aata he

 aalaa adhikariyon ke manaa karne ke baad bhi prabhaat apane 4 or saathiyon ko lekar bina kisi hathiyaar ke bharat ke sabase bade aatanki ko pakadaney ke liye nikal padataa he jisane desh ke alag alag shaharon main lagaataar dhamaake kiye hai
 This is Arjun Kapoor in the role of Prabhat Kapoor
 ye ek spai thriller film he jiskaa nirdesan kiya he rajkumaar gupta ne
 The story of the film is inspired by true events
 rajkumaar gupta pehle bhi no van kild jesica or red jaisi filmein bana chuke hai or wo filmein bhi sachhee ghatana se prerit thi
 There has been a lot of effort to keep this film realistic and it looks real
 thrill element acha he
 Spying to catch Yusuf and the journey to catch him is also good
 film ye bhi bataane main safal he ki intelligence ke kuch log aise hai jo desh ke liye kisi or baat ki parvaah nahin karte
 The film also comments clearly on the difficult situations in which our agents work
 film ke kirdaar hero nahin balki real lagate hai
 Talking about the weak link of the film, the film seems slow and there are many scene repeats which start to look bad
 film main aatanki kai baar jihad kaa matlab bataata he or ye bhi ripitetative lagate hai
 The performance of Arjun Kapoor is not as simple as that needed in this film because there is no one else in this film except him
 agar aap is tarah ki jasusi thriller filmein pasand karte hai to aap ise dekh sakate hai
 This film will not bore you
 lekin agar aap masala filmein dekhnaa pasand karte hai to shaayad ye film aapako pasand nahin aegi kyonki is film main koi masala nahin hai
 This is a realistic film based on true events and real heros
 is film ke liye meri reating he 3 star

 It is expected that onions will reach India in 80 to 100 containers soon

 According to DNA reports, several links to the film 'kabali' have been made illegal on the internet websites where such pirated films are found, defying the Madras High Court's decision against the film piracy
 
 diene ne ek sutara ke hawaale se bataaya, "hamaari film ke in gaiyrkanoonee link ko hataane ke liye hamane prashasan se sampark kiya he
 
 
 Well, since it is Rajinikanth's film, it is difficult to control or contain people's enthusiasm for a film of 'thalaivaa'

 unhone yah bhi kaha ki unke mumbai board ne 'kabali' ko certificate nahin diya he, balki chennai karyaalay se film paas kii gai he
 The comments nihlani ne diene se kaha, "ab piresi karne waalon ne rajnikant ko bhi nahin bakhsha
 
 
 'kabali' was censored in Chennai, so it has nothing to do with our Mumbai office
 
 
 isse pehle, yah salmaan khan kii 'sultan' ke saath hua tha
 
 
 However, i do not think, leaking like this on the collections of big stars films will make any difference
 
 
 li se prabhaav choti filmon par padataa he, jinamein e-list vaale sitare nahin hote
 
 
 'great Grand Masti' can be an example of this
 
 
 " On July 15, the Madras High Court banned 169 service providers against making the film available illegally online
 court ne yah bhi aadesh diya tha ki cabel tivi oparator, bas or texiyaan bhi film ko nahin dikhaa saktin
 DNA quoted a source as saying, "we have approached the administration to remove these illegal links to our film

 " central board of film certification (sibiefasi) ke pramukh pehlaaj nihlani ne diene se kaha ki bade sitaron kii filmon ko 'li' se nahin darana chahie, kyonki unhen khaas fark nahin padataa he
 He also said that his Mumbai board has not given a certificate to 'kabali', but the film has been passed from the Chennai office

 Earlier, this happened to Salman Khan's 'sultan'
