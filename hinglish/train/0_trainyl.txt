 uske baad bhi unka man nahin bharaa to chaaval ke saath bhi chatkhaare le kar khate or janata ko ise khaane ke liye prerit bhi karte rahe
 Banned on fish because Nitish Kumar government of NDA banned Andhra fish, because the chemical used to keep it fresh can cause cancer-like diseases, because it contains dangerous amount of formalin, but MLA Says that it is not known on what basis the government has banned, has eaten fish and will eat it further

 Referring to the past occasions, 'may the sentiment of public sentiment and faith be respected', the Chief Minister said that even before when the government tried to sit and reconcile both the parties, one side was stubborn with some excuse
 kai baar to baatcheet ke dauraan ek paksh bhaag gaya, ek paksh kahata he adaalat kaa jo bhi nirnay hoga ham maanenge
 a decision also came in 2010
 lekin, doosraa paksh adaalat chalaa gaya
 In such a situation, the government does not want to do any work that will bring about this situation
 unhone kaha ki ham bhi chaahate hai ki iskaa koi hal nikle
 Respect for public sentiments, respect for faith
 chaahe vah aasthaa aapaki ho yaa meri ho, kisi kii bhi ho lekin, agar vah maamla adaalat main he, to hamen adaalat ke faisle kaa bhi sammaan karnaa padegaa

 lekin is samay maamla sarvocch nyaayalay main he or 5 disambar se pratidin sunwaayee hogi hamen iskaa intjaar karnaa chahie
 The Chief Minister said that the UP government is not a party in this

 The purpose of organizing such a big event is to preserve and promote our heritage and it is my duty to do this work
 unhone kaha ki ayodhya, chitrakoot yaa varanasi main ho rahe aayojanon kaa makasad apni viraasat kaa sangrakshan or sanvardhan karnaa he

 Yogi spoke on Gujarat election and Rahul's activism
 
 The grand alliance of youth in Gujarat will have no effect

 Where are you today Every person knows and i think the people of Gujarat have seen the glory story of Gujarat's development
 pradhanmantri modi ne gujarat main vikaas kii gaurav gaatha likhi he
 Rahul Gandhi's problem is that he is active only in elections
 desh main kahin chunaav honge to rahul gandhi sirf 15 dinon tak sakriy rahete hai phir baaki saadhe 11 maheene vahanjhankane nahin jate
 For three generations, Rahul's family has been leading Amethi, but till date the DM office or the office of the Chief Minister's office could not be built there
 unhone sirf vinaash lila likhi he
 In Yogi Gujarat, the election slogan of 'vikas has gone mad', furious over Vikas's statement
 
 
 ' par yogi adityanath ne kaha ki unhone kabhi vikaas to kiya nahin, isliye kah rahe hai ki vikaas pagal ho gaya he
 The madness in his mind became crazy after seeing that development
 yogi ne kaha ki gujarat kaa vikaas pagal nahin hua
 The development there gave prosperity to the country
 vahaan ke purusharth se desh or duniya main uski nai chhavi bani he
 To call the development of Gujarat insanity is an insult to Gujarat, an insult to the youth there
 vahaan ke purusharth kaa apmaan he
 Attacking Rahul Gandhi, Yogi Adityanath said that development has not gone mad

 dilli sarkaar or centre ke bich satta ke varchasv kii ladaai par ucchtam nyaayalay ke aadesh ke baad mukhyamantri or alji kii yah pehali mulaakaat hogi
 Kejriwal wrote a letter to LG Baijal saying that matters related to 'service' are with the Council of Ministers
 kejariwal ne yah patr tab likhaa jab adhikariyon ne tabadalaa or tainaati ke adhikaar alji se lene ke ‘aap’ sarkaar ke aadesh ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 After that decision of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, Kejriwal wrote this letter in which the rights of LG have been cut significantly
 baijal ko likhe gaye patr main mukhyamantri ne kaha ki ab kisi bhi maamle main alji kii manjuuri lene kii jarurat nahin hogi
 He said that all parties need to work towards the implementation of the Supreme Court order in letter and spirit
 darasal, ucchtam nyaayalay ke aitihaasik faisle ke kuch hi ghante baad dilli sarkaar ne naukarshahon ke tabadale or tainaati ke liye ek nai vyavastha shuru kii jisamen mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko manjuuri dene vaala praadhikari bataaya gaya
 However, the Services Department refused to comply with the order, saying that the Supreme Court did not revoke the notification of 21 May 2015 of the Union Home Ministry as per which matters related to the service have been placed with the Lieutenant Governor
 kya he supreme court kaa faisla?dilli kii aam aadmi party sarkaar or uparajyapal ke bich kaaphi lambey samay se chal rahi jang ke bich aaj supreme court ne aitihaasik faisla sunaaya he
 The Supreme Court has said that the Lieutenant Governor is not free to take a decision in Delhi, LG will have to act only as per the advice of the Cabinet
 iske alaava supreme court ne saaf kar diya he ki dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja milanaa mumkin nahin he
 It is clear from the decision of the Supreme Court that the elected government of Delhi is responsible for running the state
 faisle ke baad mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne bhi twit kar khushi jataa di he, unhone kaha he ki dilli main loktantr kii jeet hui he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has been continuously alleging that the Modi government at the Center is pushing its agenda through LG and not allowing the state government to work
 supreme court ne hatya ke jurm me umraqaid kii sajaa paae saravana bhawan ke maalik pi rajagopal kii jail main samarpan karne se chhot dene or aspataal main bhartee ko hi jail maan lene kii maang thukraa di
 Rajagopal had sought exemption from going to jail due to illness
 rajagopal ko karmchaaree kii patni se shaadi karne ke liye karmchaaree kii hatya karne ke jurm me umraqaid kii sajaa hui he
 The Supreme Court dismissed the plea of P Rajagopal, the owner of the restaurant chain Saravana Bhavan, to allow him to initiate a life sentence for the 2001 kidnapping and murder of the employee
 ve apane chehre par oxigen mask lagaakar ambulance main madras hoicourt pahunche the
 72-year-old Rajagopal claimed that he was unwell
 nyaayamurti envi ramana kii adhyakshata vaali peeth ne poocha, "agar ve itane biimaar the, to unhone apni apil kii sunwaayee ke dauraan ek din ke liye bhi beemaari kaa sanket kyon nahin diya?"rajagopal dakshin bhartiya vyanjanon ke chen restaurant saravana bhawan kaa maalik he
 After being convicted on murder charges and sentenced to life imprisonment, p Rajagopal surrendered in a court in Chennai on Tuesday
 iske baad use jail bhej diya gaya
 Rajagopal has been found guilty in the murder of his employee Prince Santkumar
 supreme court ke mohalat dene se inkaar karne ke kuch ghanton baad hi rajagopal ne samarpan kar diya
 He came to the court of the Additional Sessions Judge in an ambulance with an oxygen mask and appeared before the judge in a wheelchair
 desh or videshon main lokapriy restaraan shrankhla ke sansthaapak rajagopal ko ek satr adaalat ne santkumar kii hatya ke aarope main 10 saal jail kii sajaa sunai thi
 He wanted to marry Santkumar's wife and make him his third wife
 jab mahila ne prastaav thukraa diya, to usne uske pati ko marava diya
 He appealed against the decision of the sessions court to the Madras High Court, but here his sentence was extended to life imprisonment
 sheersh adaalat ne march main sajaa barkaraar rakhi thi or use saat july ko samarpan karnaa tha
 He moved the apex court on Monday to delay the start of his term on July 7, citing illness, from where he was disappointed

 com / xejwv5urtw Sachin Tendulkar may have never scored a century at Lord's but his bat has played well in other England grounds
 isliye ummid kii jaani chahie ki recordon kaa badshaah kaa jald hi apana 100waan antarrashtriya shatak puraa karegaa
 Tendulkar has performed very poorly from the very beginning on the Mecca Lords of cricket
 unhone is maidan par jo paanch test match main khele hai unamem keval 195 ran banaae hai or unka ucchtam score 37 ran he
 He was able to score 34 and 12 runs in the first Test match played between India and England here but when it comes to other England grounds, the picture changes completely
 trentbrij, edbeston, manchester, handingle jaise maidaanon par unki tuuti boli he lekin landan ke hi ek anya maidan ovel par unhen pehle shatak kaa intjaar he
 This will be the fourth and final Test match of the series at the Oval
 naatingham ke trentbrij maidan par 29 july se doosraa test match khelaa jayega
 Tendulkar scored 78 in three matches at this ground
 16 kii ausat se 469 ran banaae hai
 In the first match he played at Trentbridge in 1996, he scored 177 runs but Tendulkar needs to be cautious as he was the victim of nervous nights in the other two Test matches he played on this ground (in 2002 and 2007)
 Were made
 lords kii tarah landan main sthit anya mashhoor test maidan ovel main bhi tendulkar kaa record aakarshak nahin he
 On this ground, he has scored 158 runs in three Tests so far with his highest score being 82 runs
 tendulkar ab 18 agast se hone vaale chauthe test match main ovel main shatak jadne kii koshish karenge
 Apart from these four grounds, Tendulkar has also played Test matches in Manchester, England and Leeds
 vah manchester kaa old traverd kaa hi maidan tha jahaan 1990 main tendulkar ne apane antarrashtriya karier kaa pehla shatak jadaa tha
 It was his ninth Test match in which he scored an unbeaten 119 in the second innings
 iske alaava unhone hendigle, leeds main bhi ek test match khelaa jisaki ekmaatr pari main unhone 193 ran banaae the
 India will not play Test matches at both these places in this tour but will play Twenty20 matches in Manchester
 tendulkar bhartiya twanti-20 team ke sadsy nahin hai lekin unhen is daure main lards par shatak jadne kaa ek or mauka mil saktaa he
 India have to play the fourth ODI against England at this historic ground and Tendulkar, who will open the Indian innings in one-day, will not want to miss the opportunity then
 team india shuukravaar ko doosraa tii-20 muqabla jitkar phiraki se khaufjada england ke khilaaf siries apane naam karne ke iraade se utregi
 On Tuesday, India performed the best all-round game and defeated the hosts by eight wickets to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series
 pehle match main kalai ke 'jaadugar' kuldeep yadav ne 24 ran dekar 5 wicket chatkaaye, jisase england main tahalaka much gaya
 The English camp is now using spin bowling machine 'merlin' to practice on the net, as it does not have wrist spin bowlers for practice
 isse pehle 2005 ashes se pehle england ne is mashin kaa istemaal kiya tha, jab australia ke paas shen worne jaisaa spinner tha
 Merlin Machine (getty) England captain Eoin Morgan admitted that Kuldeep Yadav completely dared his batsmen in the first T20 match of the series
 morgan ne saath hi kaha ki agar mejabaan team ko bharat ko siries main kadi takkar deni he, to baaki maichon main mehmaan team ke kalai ke spinneron ke khilaaf behatar pradarshan karnaa hoga
 We've been training hard with this ⬇️ ahead of our second Vitality IT20 against India

 Relaxed friends are seen running the whole time

 Most of the characters of 'delhi Bailey' are journalists, but do they not know that they will be recorded in CCTV footage while robbing the jewelery shop in Burke
 kya ye dar us mahila patrkaar ko bhi nahin jo burke se cheharaa nikaalkar lutpaat kar rahi he

 Another advice should be to decide whether the 'delhi Bailey' shown in the cinema hall near you is in English or else disappointment in Hindi can also be felt

 There have been many changes both in the screen size and the color we have seen our leaders
 kubad jaisi peeth vaale televijan seton par ubhartee laal-bhuri abha vaali gandhi or nehru kii tasveeron or indira kii chanchal kaali-safed chhaviyon se baat kaaphi aage nikal chuki he
 We now see leaders on palm-sized screens, keep an eye on them through their sharp tweets and are more closely connected to them than ever before
 modi ne jis prakaar logon se judye main maharath dikhaai he, aisa aaj tak koi doosraa bhartiya netaa nahin kar sakaa he
 As a result, in just five years, his personality has grown into our collective consciousness even more than a 70 mm film screen
 puranic german devtaa thor (hollywood ne haal ke dinon main unhen lokapriy banaaya he) kii tarah, modi ab vah maane ja rahe hai jo badalon kii gadgadahat or bijli kii chamak paidaa kar saktaa he
 They are storms that can use both the feet and the eyes of voters in their own way
 ve ab mahaj manch ke centre main nahin, balki khud manch ban gaye hai
 Welcome to modistan
 aisa koi din nahin gujarata jab pradhanmantri abhinit koi naatakeey drishy hamaari ankhon ke saamne na aata ho
 Modi addressed the nation to explain why he took an important decision like revoking the special status given to Kashmir since Article 370
 modi ne sansad main 2025 tak desh ko 50 kharab dollar aakaar kii arthvyavastha banane ke apane sapane kaa bayaan kiya or unke sahyogiyon ne megen thapthapaakar unka samarthan kiya
 It is a matter of fact that since he took power in 2014, the country's economy has been lagging and the country is currently facing the biggest economic downturn
 rajyasabha (jahaan sarkaar ke paas bahumat nahin) main bhi modi ne vipakshi ekta kii pole kholkar rakh di or teen talaak ko avaidh ghoshit karne vaala kanoon aasaani se paarit kara liya tathaa ise muslim mahilaon ke saath lambey samay se ho rahe bhedbhaav kii aitihaasik bhul ko sudhaarney kaa prayaas bataaya
 a new avatar of Modi appears in the popular show of a TV channel
 discovery ke sho ke liye ve hari vardi pahane gym corbett neshnal park ke jangalon main vichrate dikhe
 When the show's anchor, Bayer Grylls, who called Modi "extremely generous", asked him if he had dreamed of becoming Prime Minister, he replied, "my focus has always been on one thing, the nation
" development
 or main us kaam ko karke santusht hum
 "india today-karvy Insights's opinion poll of the country shows that people are not only satisfied with the way Modi is doing his work, but he is also confident that whatever work the Prime Minister has done i have shown them in full
 2019 ke aam chunaavon main bhaajapa ke chunaav abhiyaan kii aguai karte hue modi kii 300 se adhik siton ke saath sarkaar main joardaar vaapasi karne ke thik do maheene baad hue is surveykshan se pataa chalata he ki modi kii lokapriyata aasmaan chhu rahi he
 In the survey, 71 percent described his performance as Prime Minister as 'good' and 'excellent'
 yah november 2016 main unke notebandi kii ghoshnaa ke turant baad karaae gaye survey main mili 69 pratishat se bhi adhik he
 However, Modi's popularity in areas is not as much in the south as in other regions of the country
 or jab yah vishleshan samudaayon ke nazariye se kiya jaae to gaiyr-hinduon, visheshkar musalamaanon ke bich unki lokapriyata kam he
 Remember that this survey was conducted before the Modi government made a historic change in the constitutional position of Jammu and Kashmir
 us nirnay ke baad unki reating or bhi bad gai hogi, kyonki surveykshan main 57 pratishat ne kaha tha ki bhaajapa ko anuchhed 370 ko nirast karne kaa ghoshnaptr main kiya apana vaada puraa karnaa chahie
 Even before the Kashmir decision, when asked who is the best Prime Minister, he gave Modi more than all other Prime Ministers — Indira Gandhi (14 percent), Atal Bihari Vajpayee (11 percent) and Jawaharlal Nehru (9 percent)
 , Rated 37 percent
 modi ke paas janata kii nabj pahchaanane ko jo hunar he, vaisaa haal ke itihaas main kisi or netaa main nahin he
 With this Modi's tremendous confidence, deep commitment, hard work, ability to think big and the ability to take even greater risks, extraordinary communication skills and talent to execute tasks in a very dramatic way, he feels the current popularity Has reached the summit
 logon kaa maananaa he ki modi koi galat kaam kar hi nahin sakate
 The results of the country's mood survey in August 2019 give a clear indication of this thinking
 farvari 2019 main pulavama aatanki hamale or uske baad bhartiya vaayu sena ke pakistan ke balakot main ek aatanki shivi par javaabi hamale ko len
 Although it was a major intelligence failure that led to the attack in Kashmir, Modi agreed to the airstrike by taking the risk of losing the election or worse, the war with Pakistan, which made him such a strong-willed leader As seen, those who are willing to swallow the bitter pill
 surveykshan main logon ne mana ki taqatvar rashtravaadi netaa or balakot main hamale kaa saahas dikhaane ke kaaran logon ne unhen phir se chunaa
 The reaction of people to demonetisation has been confusing
 isse pehle ke desh kaa mizaaj surveykshanon main aisa dekha gaya tha ki kaale dhan ko baahar nikaalane ke notebandi ke ghoshit uddeshy ko lekar shuruaati utsaah ke baad, aage ke surveykshanon main logon ne is par chintaa jataai thi kyonki isse logon ko nijee rup se pareshaani to uthaani hi padi saath hi saath arthvyavastha ko bhi nuksaan hua tha or naukariyon kii kami bhi hui thi
 But Modi was able to convince the people that this step was necessary to curb corruption
 or aisa lagata he ki logon ne unki baat ko samajha or arthvyavastha par notebandi ke prabhaav kii parvaah kiye bina chunaavon main unka saath diya
 In the survey, 41 percent considered corruption-free governance, demonetisation and the attack on black money as the biggest achievement of the Modi government
 survey main ye teenon batann modi kii garibon ke vikaas or saamaajik sudhaar se judi yojanaayen jaise pradhanmantri awaas yojana or har ghar main shauchalay banane ke liye svachh bharat abhiyaan sareekhee kalyankari yojanaon se bhi zyada lokapriy dikhti hai
 In response to questions asked about the government's major development programs, people expressed satisfaction with the way the government implemented those programs
 dilachasp yah he ki surveykshan main logon ne chaar anya mahatvapurn gunon par hami bhari, jo modi ko khush kar sakate hai, unhen garibon kaa hamdard, bhrashtachar se mukt, janata ke saath asaadhaaran judaav or sabakaa saath, sabakaa saath, sabakaa vishwaas (baavjood iske ki unki party 437 loksabhaa siton par chunaav ladi lekin keval saat siton par musalamaanon ko khadaa kiya) main yakeen rakhane vaale netaa ke rup main dekha gaya he
 The opposition criticizes that Modi is a campaign-hungry, rich-favored, dictator, anti-muslim and always in the mode of election campaign, but people in the survey have completely rejected these allegations (rahul Gandhi, please note Give)
 janvari ke desh kaa mizaaj survey main, logon ne naukariyon kii kami or kisaanon kii pareshaani ko chintaaon kii suchi main sabase upar bataaya tha
 This gave the opposition a big issue of attack on Modi in the general election
 lekin agast ke surveykshan main log vipaksh ke aaropon se sahamat nahin dikhe or modi kii tulana main vipaksh ke paas koi netaa tak nahin he
 50 percent in the survey said that the main reason for the failure of the opposition was that it had no prime ministerial face to equal Modi and the opposition also appeared divided in the elections
 haalanki surveykshan main logon ne mana ki kisaanon kaa sankat or naukariyon kii kami, donon hi desh ke saamne badi chintaaen hai, lekin unhen lagata he ki modi main arthvyavastha kaa rukh badal dene kii kshamta he or ve in sankaton kaa samaadhaan nikaal lenge
 If elections are held today, then the number of seats BJP is expected to get, it shows that Modi is invincible
 surveykshan ke parinaam bhaajapa ko 308 siton par jeet kaa sanket dete hai jo party ko haalia aam chunaav main mili siton se paanch adhik he or party ke vot share main 37 pratishat se ek pratishat kii vruddhi ho sakati he
 Although the Congress does not see any decline in the vote share of 20 percent, but the survey shows the number of seats falling from the current 52 to 49
 congress ke liye ekmaatr raahat kii baat yah he ki rahul ke adhyaksh pad chhodie ke faisle ke baavjood, party ke vafaadaaron ne netritvviheen party ko abhi tak nahin choda he
 Asked if they believed the Congress was falling fast, 50 percent agreed
 netritv ke mudde par pratikriya mili-juli thi: 49 pratishat ne mahasoos kiya ki keval gaiyr-gandhi, gaiyr-vanshavaadi netaa hi party ko punerjeevit kar saktaa he, lekin jab unase congress ke netaaon kii reating ko kaha gaya to unhone anya congress netaaon kii tulana main priyanka or rahul, donon ko hi acchhee reating di
 In response to who can lead the opposition fight against Modi, people have seen Mamata Banerjee as the best choice, followed by Akhilesh Yadav, Arvind Kejriwal, Naveen Patnaik and Sharad Pawar
 videsh maamalon main bhi modi chamakate dikh rahe hai
 People are also supportive of Modi's view that talks with Pakistan will not begin until terrorism is completely stopped
 logon kaa maananaa he ki trump ke shasankaal main america ke saath bharat ke sambandhon main sudhaar hua he
 And also that relations with China are slowly improving during the tenure of the Modi government
 sampurna shaktisampann netaa or raashtra par uske itane bade bharose ke kai phaayde hai to kai khamiyaan bhi hai
 First, let's talk about the advantages
 apane duusare kaarykaal kii shuruyaat main hi modi ne apni party or uske sangrakshak sanghathan, rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ke teen pramukh muddon ke prati apane sankalp ko jataa diya or unamem se do vaadon ko puraa kar diya: dhara 370 ko samaapt karnaa or samaan naagarik samhita ko lagu karnaa (teen talaak adhinium ko iske hi ansh ke rup main dekha jaataa he)
 Decision on Kashmir will bring prosperity or violent resistance and terrorist attacks will increase, only time will tell
 ek anya mudde, ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan ke liye madhyasthata ke vifal hone ke baad party ummid kar rahi he ki supreme court se faisla uske manonukool aayega
 Modi has kept Hindutva supporters very happy, but has gone beyond the narrow cultural agenda to focus on the development model advocated by RSS leaders like Deendayal Upadhyay
 vikaas or aarthik samruddhi ke liye unke is drushtikon ke saath hi haal ke bajet main unke saahasik agenda ko bhi samarthan mil rahaa he, jisamen desh ko paanch varshon main 50 kharab dollar kii arthvyavastha banane kaa sankalp shaamil he
 Still, when it comes to drastic reforms to boost the economy, Modi seems to be preferring to step in slowly, rather than making blatant announcements
 ek sahyogi kehete hai, ''pradhanmantri dishaheen vighatnkaaree upayon kii bajaae sahi disha or sthir sudhaaron kii ore le jane ke prayaason main adhik vishwaas karte hai
 "but they should also pay attention to the fact that to fulfill their dream of $ 50 trillion, they will have to go for drastic reforms
" auto or real estate jaise pramukh kshetron ke adhar main latakane ke saath aarthik mandi kii spasht chetavanee mil rahi he or modi sarkaar ko iskaa hal khojna he
 One danger of such popularity and an overwhelming majority in Parliament is that the expectations of the voters go up
 aise main kisi bhi netaa yaa sarkaar ke liye janata ko santusht karnaa behad mushkil ho jaataa he
 What is the result of the extraordinary expectations of the public, only the Indian cricket team knows it well
 team kii prashansa or uske khilaadi tabhi tak hero bane rahete hai jab tak team jitati rahati he
 But as the performances falter, popularity falls sharply and heroes are at the center of criticism as seen after the recent World Cup performance
 doosraa khatra yah he ki aapke faislon par sawaal uthaane or aapke nirnyon main sudhaar ke liye baadhya karne ke kad vaala koi sahyogi yaa majboot vipakshi nahin he, to aap bahut jaldi dambhi ho sakate hai
 Usually, a situation like totalitarianism starts and leaders become dependent on very small circles
 apane duusare kaarykaal main modi ko vipaksh ke sujhaavon kaa swaagat karnaa chahie or aalochanaon (media kii aalochanaon ko bhi) ko bhi gambhirtha se or apane haq main samajhnaa chahie
 The country has recently successfully tested its largest rocket GSLV Mark-3 for the second Chandrayaan mission, Modi and his colleagues can learn some lessons from the laws of physics associated with the rocket's speed
 udaan ke dauraan ek rocket ko shuruaati udaan ko sthir banaae rakhane ke liye vishaal bhaar kii bhi jarurat hoti he jo use khinchataa he
 Without it, he may get out of control
 bhaar ke kaaran vah jo khinchaav anubhav karata he, usase rocket ko tab tak apana santulan banaae rakhane main madad milti he jab tak yah prithvi ke gurutvkarshan bal se mukt hone ke liye paryaapt dhakka nahin lagaataa or vaanchit oonchai tak nahin pahunch jaataa
 Just like with a rocket, any leader needs to welcome his criticisms and take lessons from him only then can he achieve the desired altitude by maintaining complete balance during his flight
 modi kii kai khoobiyon main ek yah bhi he ki ve ek achche shrota hai or chizon ko bahut teji se sikhte hai
 If the Prime Minister makes good use of these qualities, then even the sky will not be out of his reach

 Chaturvedi said that the Jayas party wants him to contest from Gwalior East assembly seat

 But he has said in a conversation with Aaj Tak that the motive for which Jayas is contesting is with Jayas for the success of that cause
 ashish chaturvedi ne bataaya ki unki jais ke sangrakshak doctor heeralaal alaava se baatcheet chal rahi he or jald hi wo apana faisla saarvajanik karenge

 pakistan ke saath ek samay kashmir mudde ke samaadhaan par 'lagbhag pahunch chukne' ke pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke daawey ke duusare din bhaajapa ne aaj ''us vifal rahe samaadhaan'' kii desh ko vistrut jaankaree dene kii maang kii
 Senior party leader Arun Jaitley told reporters here, "what was the possible solution for Kashmir?" The people of India have the right to know the answer to this question
 '' unhone ummid jataai ki kashmir mudde kaa samaadhaan karne ke prayaas main bharat sarkaar pakistan kii disha main nahin bad rahi he jiskaa ki is bare main adhuraa agenda he
 Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha said that Pakistan considers weakening the Line of Control, demilitarizing it and having a tripartite system on Kashmir to resolve Kashmir issue as 'success'
 ''mujhe ummid he ki sarkaar is disha main aage nahin bad rahi he
 He said that the Prime Minister made the first revelation in his press conference yesterday that the intelligence ambassadors of India and Pakistan had almost reached a solution to the Kashmir issue in a meeting, but when it seemed successful, Pakistan's The then ruler General Pervez Musharraf had to withdraw from power and that possible compromise was stuck
 bhaajapa netaa ne kaha ki chunki pradhanmantri ne pehali baar rahasyodghatan kiya he ki kashmir mudde kaa 'samaadhaan lagbhag' hone vaala tha isliye yah jaruri he ki vah is sambandh main desh ko vishwaas main len ki 'us vifal rahe samaadhaan' main kya kya baaten thim
 Taking a sarcasm at the Prime Minister's comment that history will show 'generosity' towards him, rather than the current opposition party and the media, Jaitley said that right to give an opportunity to test history, Singh has failed to address the Kashmir issue
 Tell the country about the facts of the solution
 unhone kaha ki kashmir par pakistan kaa agenda adhuraa he lekin bharat kii is mudde par sthiti ekadam spasht he or vah yah he ki jammu kashmir bharat kaa abhinn ang he
 The parliament unanimously passed a resolution in 1994 stating that Pakistan-occupied Kashmir is an integral part of India
 bharat kaa yah drudh mat bhi he ki kashmir maamle main kisi tisare paksh kaa hastkshep asweekaarya he
 Jaitley said that India had made tireless efforts to not allow the Kashmir issue to be internationalized for so many years and hoped that any possible settlement would not waste the gains made on the Kashmir issue
 chetavanee dete hue unhone kaha ki pakistan kii ore se aatanki dhaanche ko nasht kiye bina kashmir ghati kaa visanikaran kiya janaa desh ke liye vinaashkari sabit hoga
 Terming the 'nehruvian view' of giving separate status to Jammu and Kashmir (article 370) as flawed, Jaitley said that this 'separate status has led to separatism in the last few years'
 nyaay ke devtaa shani agar krodhit hon, to kya devtaa auki kya insaan sabhi thar-thar kaanpane lagate hai

 But Peepal and Shami are the two trees on which Saturn is influenced

 Senior BJP leader LK Advani feels that the Allahabad High Court verdict has confirmed the significance of his Ayodhya Rath Yatra
 lekin vah chaahate hai ki baatcheet ke jariye ram mandir ke nirmaan ko tarjeeh di jaae
 Advani started the rath yatra in 1989 and was the major face of the temple campaign
 unhone ucch nyaayalay kii lakhanu peeth ke pichley hafte ke faisle main aasthaa ko kanoon se upar rakhane sambandhi aalochanatmak tippaniyon ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki yah keval ‘kanoon dwaara aasthaa main bharosa’ karne kaa maamla he
 He strongly supported his party president Nitin Gadkari's suggestion that Muslims could build mosques 'off campus' on the banks of the Saryu River
 agle maheene 84 varsh ke hone ja rahe adwani ne bayanon main badi saavdhaanee dikhaai or vah faisle ke baad khud ko vijayi nahin darshane se bachate rahe or aisa kuch nahin kahana chaha jo muslim samudaay main khalabali paidaa kare
 When Advani was asked whether his temple campaign from Somnath to Ayodhya in 1989 was exonerated by the court's decision, he said, "yes, i feel innocent because i believe that by 1989, the BJP is the leader of this (temple) movement
" Was not a part which was actually started in 1949
 ’aage kii karrwai or baatcheet ke madhyam se samjhaute ke liye bhaajapa or sangh parivaar ke prayaas ke sawaal par bhaajapa netaa ne kaha, ‘aage kaa rasta yahi he ki donon samudaayon ke bich is par sahmati ho ki yah hona chahie (ayodhya main mandir nirmaan)’
 Advani said that as far as the verdict is concerned, it reflects the aspirations of millions of people who want to build a Ram temple at the place where Rama's birthplace is believed to be
 unhone kaha, ‘lekin yah acha hoga ki yah na keval adaalat kaa faisla ho balki donon samudaayon kaa bhi yahi nirnay ho
 He also ruled out the possibility that the Allahabad High Court verdict would also allow people to raise their voice on disputes related to religious places in Kashi and Mathura on the ground that faith was preferred over law
 adwani ne kaha, ‘nahin nahin
 There is no similarity between the two
 isi vajah se baatcheet ke dauraan (2004 se pehle rajg sarkaar or donon samudaayon ke netaaon ke bich) hinduon ne muslim paksh, jisane is tarah kii ashanka jataai thi, ko spasht sandesh diya tha ki ve samaadhaan par svaichhik sahmati jataayenge to aisa nahin hoga
 He said, 'we talked about it then
 mujhe nahin lagata ki is faisle main aisa he kyonki kul milakar ayodhya ek mudda rahaa he jisane desh ke raajnneetik itihaas ko badal diya
 However, during the interview, the BJP Parliamentary Party President did not discuss whether the Allahabad High Court verdict in 1992 justified the demolition of the disputed structure
 is mudde par unki taraf se koi tippanee nahin ai ki faisle ne vidhwans maamle ko halkaa kiya yaa nahin
 Advani still believes that the day the disputed structure was demolished was 'the saddest day of his life'
 adwani ke mutabik unhone hameshaa kaha he ki is andolan main jo bhi mandir ke nirmaan ke paksh main rahe ve jor jabardastee se yah nahin karnaa chaahate the
 He said, 'and when i said that i was feeling very stressed that day (on 6 December 1992), the late Pramod Mahajan who was with me said,' Why are you sitting here in this posture
 hamen lakhanu chalanaa chahie
 'according to Advani,' i said okay
 main shaam kareeb saadhe paanch-chah baje nikal gaya

 or meraa afsos isliye tha ki koi bhi raajnneetik dal kuch bhi paanaa chahta he to vah use kanoonee prakriya se hasil karnaa chahta he, dabaavpurvak nahin
 Advani said that Ram's statue was installed in 1949 and the court ordered that it should not be removed
 unhone kaha, ‘lambey samay tak daravaaje band rahe or jo log darshan karne aate the ve baahar se kiya karte the
 After this the doors were opened on the orders of the court under the rule of Rajiv (gandhi)
 mandir kaa shilanyas bhi rajeev ke shasankaal main kiya gaya
 The BJP leader said, "therefore, my stand has been that those who want to build temples are not doing anything against the law
 jo iskaa virodh kar rahe hai ve adaalat ke aadesh kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 Advani said that people tell him that his rath yatra sparked debate on what is genuine secularism and pseudo-secularism
 unhone kaha, ‘us vakt pehali baar maine chhadam dharmanirpekshata shabd kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Even in the early years of independence, there were two ideas about what kind of approach should be taken on such a question
 ’ adwani ke anusaar, ‘ek ko main vaastavik dharmanirpekshata kahuunga

 Not only this, Android q will also be supported in this
 camere ke maamle main ye thodaa purana lagegaa, kyonki isamen ek rier camera he

 Then daughter Vidya became his support
 vidya ke pita ne gender ikvality jaise muddon par bhi khulkar baat kii

 iske baad bhartiya janata party 25 seat ke saath duusare sthaan par rahi
 The National Conference won 15 seats and the Congress 12 seats
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne lambey samay baad ‘man kii baat’ kahi he
 He said in a program in Patna that his government is following the formula of 'three C'
 unhone kaha, 'kaam karte jaaie, kaam kii patibaddhta he or ham kaam karte rahenge
 We will never compromise crime (crime), corruption (corruption) and communalism (communalism)
 'gauratlab he ki nitish kumaar rajya main bijepi ke sahyog se sarkaar chalaa rahe hai or mukhya vipakshi party argedy ke yuva netaa or rajya ke purv upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav unhen har maukey par gher rahe hai
 Whenever Stunning speaks
 jab bhi twit karte hai to unke nishane par rajya ke mukhiya hote hai
 Stunning, Nitish surrounds the government on the same fronts, on which Nitish Kumar has given a no-compromise statement
 nitish kumaar, sahi maukey par sahi baat kehane ke liye jane jate hai
 He speaks less but when he speaks he has many victims of one statement
 isi vajah se lalu yadav kehete the ki nitish kumaar ke munh main nahin, pet main daant hai
 To have teeth in the stomach means to be very vicious
 nitish ke is bayaan ke bhi kai matlab dekhe ja rahe hai
 It is being said directly that Nitish has responded to the allegations leveled by the opposition party in his statement, but some people believe that this single statement has given Nitish Kumar to RJD as well as his ally BJP a clear message has been given, some of whose leaders often make communal statements in Bihar
 khayr, agar ham nitish kumaar ke bayaan ko sachai ke taraazoo par tarkon ke vajan se taulen to sthiti ult dikhti he
 On the very next day after Nitish Kumar's statement that about 40 thousand copies of matriculation examination have disappeared from Gopalganj
 police ne maamla darj kar liya he or jaanch chal rahi he
 Bihar witnessing all time high crime
 Rapes every month- 98murder every month- 233kidnapping every month- 725theft,loot & Crime evry mnth-20120and No Headlines & Debates of Jungalraj from sponsored media who would had cried at the drop of the hat, had it been in RJD rule
 - Tejashwi Yadav (@yadavtejashwi) June 18, 2018 Another big case came from Gaya
 khabar ai ki bihar ke gaya se ek vyakti ko ped se baandhakar uski patni or beti ke saath gangrape kiya gaya
 Police has arrested 20 people in this case
 isi maheene ek bada maamla mujjafarpur se bhi saamne aayaa
 The sexual abuse of girls seeking asylum in the government-run girl child was revealed here
 police ne FIR darj kar lee he
 In some media reports, it was even said that girls and girls were supplied from this girls' reform home to leaders and officials
 iske alaawaabiharse aise chah video viral ho chuke hai jinamein ladakiyon ke saath kuch ladke jabadasti karte hue, maar-peet karte hue or gaali-galouj karte hue dikhe
 Even if we talk about other 'C' corruption, it does not seem that the present government of Bihar is impeccable
 adhikariyon ke dwaara kiye ja rahe karpshan main sabase taaja maamla bihar ke mujffarpur jile ke varisht police adheekshak (esaspi) vivek kumaar kaa he
 a large amount of cash was recovered in a raid at Vivek Kumar's government residence for two days
 iske alaava may main tejasvi yadav ne rajya ke up mukhyamantri or bijepi netaa susheel modi par bhrashtachar ke kai gambhir aarope lagaae the
 There was no response from the government nor from Sushil Modi
 nitish kumaar bihar kii raajnneeti main aae hi is naare ke saath the ki unki sarkaar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf 'jiro tolerance’ kii niti apnayegi or aisa kaha jaataa he ki apane pehle kaarykaal main unhone bihar main bahut had tak sushasan sthapit bhi kar diya tha
 But gradually the situation changed to three feet of the same Dhaka
 pichley dedh dashak se bhrashtachar ke khilaaf chal rahe abhiyaan main abtak 1700 se adhik loksevakon ko na keval ghoosekhori karte range haathon pakadaa gaya, balki unhen jail kii hawa bhi khaani padi
 The government has seized more than 20 crores of black earnings of about one and a half dozen big bureaucrats
 ab baat tisare 'si’ yani ki communalism kii
 Nitish Kumar's real fight in Bihar was from RJD
 argedy se ladane ke liye nitish kumaar ne bijepi ke saath gathbandhan kiya
 Won elections and the government lasted for five years
 lekin 2016 main nitish kumaar bijepi se alag ho gaye or argedy-jadyu main mahagathbandhan hua
 Won the elections but the alliance broke and once again Nitish Kumar formed the government in the state in collaboration with the BJP
 saal 1989 main hue bhagalpur dangon ke baad chhitput ghatnaon ko chhod kamobesh bihar ne sampradayik hinsa kaa daur nahin dekha
 Whether it was Nitish Kumar's government or Lalu Prasad Yadav's
 donon ke shasankaal main sampradayik sauhaard kaa maahaul bana rahaa
 This is the first time that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who claims not to compromise on law and order, is looking helpless
 hameshaa shanti se manaae jane vaale ramanavami jaise tyohaar ke maukey par rajya ke kai jilon main sampradayik tanaav dekhne ko mila
 During this period, the state and the country have witnessed arson in many places, skirmishes between the two sects and curfew for several days
 ab sawaal uthta he ki ye sab achaanak kyon hua or kya nitish kumaar kii sarkaar ne maahaul ko sahi tareeke se handle kiya
 In this regard, senior journalist Rajendra Tiwari, who has a deep understanding of the politics of the state, while talking to the BBC some time ago said, 'nitish Kumar ran the government with the Bharatiya Janata Party from 2005 to 2013
 lekin unhone kabhi bhi kanoon vyavastha se samjhauta nahin kiya
 Even after separating from the BJP, there were attempts to incite riots during the Kandar Yatra, but the administration kept dealing with it strictly
 lekin pehali baar aisa ho rahaa he ki vahi bhaajapa he, vahi nitish kumaar hai par karrwai nahin kii ja rahi
 ' centre sarkaar ne agle bajet satr se rail bajet ko aam bajet ke saath milaane ke prastaav ko hari jhandi de di he
 The government has put a stop to the tradition that has been going on for years by presenting the railway budget and the general budget separately
 rail bajet ko aam bajet se alag pesh kiye jane kii parampara 1924 main shuru kii gai thi
 Know, the big things related to the merger and what will be the effect of this move of Modi government
 
 
 1
 Now for the upcoming fiscal year 2017-18, only the General Budget will be presented in Parliament in the year 2017
 iske alaava ek viniyojan vidheyak hoga
 This will not affect the autonomy of the railways
 2
 The Finance Ministry will now decide the budget of the Railway Ministry, but the rights of both the ministries are still to be shared and the process for this will be decided
 3
 The general budget will contain the details of the cost and non-cost expenditure of the Railways
 4
 The Union Cabinet has decided to change the entire budget process itself
 iske tahat ab aam bajet pesh kiye jane kii taarikh or pehle ho jaaegi
 5
 vitt or rail mantralay ke bich is baat par sahmati he ki aane vaale dinon main kiraye main kami or badhotaree ke liye rail tarriff athurity banaai jaaegi
 6
 agar rail bajet ko aam bajet main mila diya jaataa he to isse nakadi kii kami se jujh rahi railway ko har saal takreeban 10 hajaar karod rupee kii bachat hogi
 Because the Ministry of Railways has to pay this amount as dividend
 7
 Even after the merger of the Railway Budget in the General Budget, the Ministry of Railways will be allowed to announce new trains and projects
 8
 The Finance Ministry will also help in sharing the huge burden on the Railway Ministry due to the Seventh Pay Commission
 9
 After the merger of both budgets, the revenue deficit and capital cost of the railways will now be transferred to the Finance Ministry
 10
 The Ministry of Railways will no longer have to beg the finance ministry for gross budgetary support

 cabinet ne bharat main bijnes karnaa aasaan banane ke liye ek ahm faisla kiya he
 In a cabinet meeting chaired by the Prime Minister on Wednesday, it has been decided that the Petroleum Minister and Finance Minister will have the right to allot oil blocks to the seeders under the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy in the field of petroleum and natural gas
 tippaniyan The Government of India is hopeful that this decision will soon take a decision on the allocation of oil blocks
 sambhav hoga or isse se desh main ease of doing business (vyapaar karne main aasaani) kii kavayad majboot hogi
 Currently, the process of allocation of oil blocks is quite complex
 iske liye alag-alag mantralayon ke bich samanvay or aam sahmati banane main lambaa vakt lagata he jiske baad prastaav ko cabinet kii aarthik maamalon kii samiti ke saamne pesh karnaa padataa he aayal blox ke aavanton ko antim manzuri ke liye
 But now the Petroleum Minister and Finance Minister will be able to take this decision after consulting each other
 bharat sarkaar ko ummid he kii is faisle se aayal blox ke aavanton ke bare faisla jaldi lenaa It will be possible and this will strengthen the ease of doing business in the country
 philhal aayal blox ke aavanton kii prakriya kaaphi jatil he
 For this, it takes a long time for coordination and consensus among different ministries after which the proposal has to be presented before the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs for final approval of allocation of oil blocks
 lekin ab ye faisla petroleum mantri or vitt mantri aapas main salaah mashvire ke baad le sakenge
 Currently, the process of allocation of oil blocks is quite complex

 aisa bilkul nahin he ki shaadi ke baad mahila yaa purush is baat ke liye pratibandhit ho jaaen ki wo apane saathi ke alaava na to kisi ko dekhenge or na hi baat karenge
 If this is the case then it is completely wrong
 par agar ye keval dekhakar tarif karne yaa baat karne tak hi simit nahin hai to beshak ise galat kehane main koi sankoch nahin hona chahie
 Being attracted towards someone is a different thing, but because of that attraction, it is totally wrong to keep your married life on the run
 haalanki kisi bhi baat ko sahi galat tehraane se pehle ye jaan lenaa bahut jaruri he ki us baat kii vajah kya he
 There can be many reasons for having an extra-marital affair, but if those reasons are known in time, then this problem can be overcome
 zyaadaatar maamalon main extra-marital afaire shaadishuda jindagi main kalah hone kii vajah se hote hai lekin ye ekmaatr kaaran nahin he
 Here are five such reasons that can lead to extra-marital affairs: 1
 bahut kam umr main shaadi ho jane kii vajah segharavaalon or samaaj kii vajah se aksar kuch logon kii shaadi bahut kam umr main ho jaati he
 Job is not done but marriage is done
 aise log jab jindagi ke agle padaav par pahunchate hai to unhen ye lagane lagata he ki unhone kaaphi kuch miss kar diya he
 In such a situation, they begin to move towards the extra-marital Affair
 2
 If you do not get sexual orientation, this can also be a major reason that your partner is attracted to someone other than you
 kai maamalon main to ye sabase badi or ekmaatr vajah hoti he
 3
 atirikt sambandh main bharosaek ore jahaan vaivaahik sambandh ko kaamyaab banaae rakhane ke liye sex life kaa kaamyaab hona jaruri hai vahiin kuch log aise hote hanginamein atirikt sambandhon ko lekar creaving hoti he
 Despite being satisfied with their partner, they are eager to have a relationship with the other
 4
 Suddenly disillusioned, although this happens rarely but where a sense of comparison comes in a relationship, the relationship starts to disintegrate
 achaanak se koi or aapako sundar dikhne lagata he or aapkaa apana saathi badsoorat
 All its qualities become demerit for you and every little thing of the other person starts feeling good
 5
 Once a child is born, as soon as a couple becomes a parent, their life changes completely
 unki praathamiktaayen badal jaati hai or kai baar rahane kaa tarika bhi
 Often in such a situation, men are disillusioned with their work because they spend more time with their child

 aam chunaav 2009 main congress ne saansadon kii dabl centuri lagaai to usamen 21 siton ke saath uttar pradesh kaa ahm yogadan tha
 Here the Congress was able to improve its position after a long time
 tatkaaleen bispi shashan se trast, sapa par andeh or bijepi kii danvadol sthiti ne congress ko mauka diya
 Then the populist schemes like the farm loan waiver of the central government had aroused confidence, but was the Congress able to maintain that trust? India Today group-c voter sensed the mood of the country, then the Congress in the state with the highest 80 Lok Sabha seats in the country Looks ravishing
 surveykshan ke mutabik, aaj ke halaat main congress 2009 main jiti loksabhaa kii 21 siton ke mukaable mahaj 5 siton par simat sakati he
 Due to the Congress losing UP, the UPA seats at the national level seem to be lower than the NDA

 He says angrily, "in the last Lok Sabha election, MP and current foreign minister Salman Khurshid promised to build a dam in Shamsabad to avoid flooding in 50 villages along the river Ganges, but in the last four years the dam Far from being built, not even a sack of sand is placed on the banks of the Ganges
 ”akele laal bahadur hi nahin, baadh se sabase zyada peedit jile farrukhabad kii 250 gram sabhaaon main rahane vaali ek lakh se zyada kii aabaadi baadh se beghar ho chuki he
 The apathy of the MP for the development work in Farrukhabad has now started giving strength to the voices of protest in the area

 More than one lakh farmers have left farming and migrated to other states for wages
 ”congress saansad jeet hasil karne ke baad khud ko janata se jodgaye kii bajaae pichley chaar saal se congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa kareebi banane ke liye hi jatan karte rahe
 Mohammad Azharuddin, MP and former cricketer from Moradabad seat in western Uttar Pradesh, recently moved to the parliamentary constituency after the party high command rebuked him
 sthaneey raajnneeti kii nabj kii bhi thaah rakhane vaale homeopathic doctor ali akram kehete hai, ''ajahar celibrity the, chunaav jeet gaye lekin janata se nahin jude
 If you fight now, how will you win? " The reason for Azharuddin's victory from here was s in behalf of SP at the last moment in 2009
 tii
 Hassan's candidature was also changed, which led to a lot of pandemonium on this seat with a Muslim population of 50 per cent and a lottery for cricketer-turned-politician Azharuddin
 lekin is baar unke khilaaf jabardast gussa he
 Outside the Circuit House on Delhi Road in Moradabad, some laborers say with a sip of tea, "rahul Gandhi's speech and promises made people hopeful, so chose Congress
" lekin chunaav jeetne ke baad ajaharuddin dikhe hi nahin
 "the results of the surveys and the ground reality are showing how the Congress could not make the 2009 victory in UP a means of revival of the party
" 2009 main congress kii jeet kaa sabase bada aadhaar uski kisaan karj maafee or manaregaa jaisi loklubhaavan yojanaayen thim
 Apart from this, local political equations of other parties also went in the interest of Congress
 sapa ke varisht muslim netaa ajam khan party se baahar the, to kalyaan singh or mulaayam singh yadav kii najdiki ne musalamaanon ko congress kii ore mode diya
 Because of LK Advani being the pm's candidate from BJP, the Muslim society also chose Congress as a substitute at the national level
 lekin is jeet ke myne ko samajhane main congress naakaam rahi
 Principal of Maharaja Harishchandra PG College of Moradabad, Prof
 harbansh dikshit kehete hai, ''2009 main congress kii jeet main aam aadmi se judi yojanaon kii bhoomika thi
 But now the issues coming against the Congress in corruption, inflation and in pieces have started to create an atmosphere that the party is no longer reliable
 ” unako bhi lagata he ki is baar congress kii siten kam honi hai
 One of the important reasons for the Congress losing ground in UP is that the party is experimenting in building an organizational structure, but is unable to decide any clear direction
 sanghathan ke lihaaj se upi congress kii prayogshaala banakar rah gaya he
 Reader in the Economics Department of Meerut University, Dr
 manoj sivaach kehete hai, ''pradesh main jamini str par congress kaa dhaancha abhi tak taiyaar nahin ho paaya he
 The gap between local activists and state leaders is increasing constantly
 pichley aath maheenon ke dauraan sanghathan kaa jonal system koi prabhaav nahin chhod paaya he or upie sarkaar main mahangaai, bhrashtachar ke aaropon se janata main alokapriy ho rahi congress kaa sthaneey kaaryakarta udasin ho gaya he
 The factionalism and tussle within the organization has been completed
 congress mahasachiv or pradesh congress ke prabharee madhusudan mistre kehete hai, ''sanghathan main kisi bhi str par anushaasanheenata bardaasht nahin hogi
 Congress candidates will now decide from top to bottom
 chunaav bhi pratyaashee nahin, party ladegi
 The performance of the Congress in the next Lok Sabha election will be even better than the last time
 ” lekin khud loksabhaa chunaav haar chuke mistre kii kaaryastylee bahut se varisht netaaon ko hi raas nahin aa rahi
 They are unable to muster the courage to protest by calling him 'rahul's Lathait'
 itnaa hi nahin, congress kii taiyaari jameen par nahin utar paa rahi
 In December 2012, the then General Secretary in-charge of UP Digvijay Singh announced that the Congress would announce its Lok Sabha candidates a year in advance
 lekin sach yah he ki is bare main abhi congress charchaa bhi nahin kar pai he
 Whereas parties like BSP, SP have fielded most of their candidates
 vahiin congress ab bhi sthaneey kaaryakartaaon kii bajaae nijee surveykshan agenciyon ke sahare he
 The Congress has found a 'corporate' way to fix the organization
 iske liye jile se lekar block str tak cametiyon kaa gathan party netaaon ke intervyuu ke aadhaar par kiya jayega
 For this, 'biodata' has been called from interested party leaders
 is pahal par pradesh ke ek bade netaa chutki lete hai, ''rahul gandhi ne congress ko 'biodata congress’ bana diya he
 The reality will be revealed when the public will see the biodata of party leaders in the elections
 ”congress bhale post he, lekin duusari badi rashtriya party bijepi bhi khaas karishma nahin dikhaa paa rahi
 The India Today group-c voter survey has clearly revealed that despite taking charge of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi's BJP election campaign and giving more attention to UP, the party seems to get only a marginal lead
 surveykshan ke mutabik, bijepi ko loksabhaa chunaav main 2009 kii 10 siton ke mukaable sirf do siton kaa phayda ho rahaa he
 Political analyst and principal of Saket College, Faizabad, Dr

 This work should have been done immediately after the assembly elections
 loksabhaa chunaav se kuch maheene pehle booth par sanghathan khadaa karne se nichle str par party kaaryakartaaon ke saamne pahchaan kaa sankat rahegaa
 Instead of increasing the base of the party, their emphasis will be more on identifying themselves, which will not benefit the BJP
 ”lekin 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main 29
 The Samajwadi Party (SP), which formed the government by winning 224 seats with 2 per cent of the votes, may have been under constant criticism due to law and order and lax administration but the pace of the 'cycle' in the Lok Sabha elections is showing
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 23 siten jeetne vaali sapa ko india today samooh or si voter surveykshan main agle loksabhaa chunaav main 34 siten milane kaa anumaan he
 Manoj Pandey, a minister in the Akhilesh Yadav government of the state, says, "SP will win more than 34 seats from UP
 agar survey ko hi sahi maan liya jaae to isse yah sabit ho jaataa he ki upi main akhilesh sarkaar lagaataar lokapriy ho rahi he
 “during the last two months, Mulayam Singh Yadav has vigorously initiated election preparations by holding more than two dozen meetings with party leaders and workers
 party kii pehali praathamikta loksabhaa kii 23 jiti hui siton ko agle chunaav main bhi barkaraar rakhane ke saath un 15 siton main se kam se kam 10 jeetne kii he jin par sapa duusare number par thi
 The last time Azam Khan was out of the party and Mulayam's friendship with Kalyan Singh disappointed the Muslims
 isse sapa 2004 main mili 39 siton ke mukaable 23 siton par aa gai thi
 But the SP is seeing the impact of the nation-wide atmosphere against the Congress as its advantage
 vidhansabha chunaav main sapa ko sabase zyada safalataa madhya upi, purvanchal or ruhelkhand ilaake main mili thi
 To sustain this success, the SP has resorted to a predominantly yadav-muslim-brahmin alliance
 sapa ab tak kul 71 loksabhaa ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa kar chuki hai or inamen se ek darjan siton par party ke andruni survey ke aadhaar par ummidavaar badale bhi ja chuke hai
 Like SP, BSP is also expected to increase the number of Lok Sabha seats
 india today samooh or si voter ke survey ke mutabik, 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 20 siten jeetne vaali bispi ko agle loksabhaa chunaav main 27 siten milane kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya he jo loksabhaa chunaavon main party kaa ab tak kaa sarvshereshth pradarshan mana jayega
 BSP state spokesperson Swami Prasad Maurya says, "the way the BSP candidates are getting huge support in their areas, it is clear that by the time elections come, a large number of people from all the communities will join the party and BSP of UP Will capture the maximum of 80 Lok Sabha seats
 ” bispi pehali party he jisane sabhi 80 loksabhaa siton par apane ummidavaar ghoshit kar duusari partiyon ko taiyaariyon main peeche chhod diya he
 As part of her three-pronged strategy, Mayawati's first goal is to win the majority of the 17 reserved Lok Sabha seats in the state
 in surakshit siton main 10 pashchimi jilon main hai, jin par party ne jatav ummidavaaron ko utaara he
 The BSP has weaved its challenge into the fabric of castes by taking down Pasi on five seats in central districts, Pasi on a reserved seat in the east and the Kashyap community candidate on the other
 iske saath bispi ne 21 brahmanon ko loksabhaa chunaav kaa tikat dekar ek baar phir 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaav main aajamaai ja chuki soshal ejineering par behad aakraamak dhang se daanv khelaa he
 Nasimuddin Siddiqui, the party leader and national general secretary in the Legislative Council, has held more than 25 rallies so far to connect Muslims with the BSP with Dalits and Brahmins
 siddiki kehete hai, ''sapa sarkaar musalamaanon ko unka haq dilaanaa to dur, inke jaano-maal kii raksha tak nahin kar pai he
 In the post-assembly election riots, Muslims have suffered the most

 The Supreme Court has given its verdict on the exit and command policy of the Indian Army
 supreme court ne nirdesh diya he ki bhartiya sena main kambet sport unit ke liye karnal ke 141 pad kii niyukti nikaali jaaen
 Along with this, the Supreme Court has overturned the Tribunal's decision to cancel the policy and upheld the Army policy

 The commentsthis policy, made in 2009 main banaai gai is policy ko armd forcej tribynul ne radd kar diya tha jiske khilaaf centre ne supreme court main apil kii thi
 The Center argues that this step was taken to keep younger officers in combat units
 supreme court main ye bhi daleel di gai ki is vakt pakistan main aise afasaron kii ausat umr 35 saal jabaki china main 40 saal he
 However, during the hearing itself, the central government had said that it was also making 141 additional posts of colonel so that the people of the rest of the unit could also benefit from it
 iske saath hi supreme court ne tribunel ke policy ko radd karne ke faisle ko palat diya he or sena kii policy ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 In fact, in the Indian Army, only the officers of a war-going unit like the infantry are promoted as colonels, whereas units like engineering units do not have this facility
 tippaniyan This policy, made in 2009, was canceled by the Armed Forces Tribunal against which the Center appealed to the Supreme Court
 centre kii daleel he ki combat uniton main kam umr ke afasar rakhane ke liye ye kadam uthaaya gaya

 Our scientists are not losers
 bas jeet kii khushi unke haath se nikalakar kuch samay ke liye aage nikal gai he
 What would happen if Vikram Lander was not contacted? 
 
 
 This question is in everyone's mind
 aaie, aapako bataate hai ki agar kisi bhi tarah se isro ke vaigyanik vikram lander se sampark nahin kar pate hai to bhavishya kii kya yojana he
 2
 1 KM nahin, 335 meter par tutaa tha vikram se ISRO kaa sampark, ye graph he sabutachandrayan-3 main bheje jaaenge apgraded vikram lander or pragyan rovarisro ke vishwast sutron ne bataaya he ki isro ne is baat par vichaar karnaa shuru kar diya he ki agar vikram lander se sampark nahin hua to ve vikram lander or pragyan rover kaa apgraded yani aadhunik varjan ko chandrayan-3 main bhejenge
 Lander and rover going to Chandrayaan-3 will be equipped with better sensors, powerful cameras, state-of-the-art control system and more powerful communication system
 aisa bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki chandrayan-3 ke sabhi hisson main byaap sanchaar pranali bhi lagaai ja saktaa he taaki kisi bhi prakaar kii anhoni hone par byaap sanchaar pranali kaa upyog kiya ja sake
 India's Brahmastra may be lying in space, it may give important role in surgical strike, India may be in Chandrayaan-3 It is said that Indian Space Agency isro's Chandrayaan-3 mission also includes Japan's Space Agency Jaxa (JAXA) Help iske liye vah apana sabase taqatvar rocket ech-3 kaa upyog karegaa
 However, this rocket is currently being built
 is mishan ke liye bharat lander or orbitor degaa or japan rocket or rover kii suvidha pradaan karegaa
 It is expected that due to the powerful rocket of Japan, Chandrayaan-3 will reach the moon soon
 ye kaisaa inaam? Chandrayaan-2 se pehle sarkaar ne kaati ISRO vaigyanikon kii tankhwaahchandrayan-2 se mili aankadon ke aadhaar par tay hoga chandrayan-3 mishabhi, isro main chandrayan-3 ke bare main taiyaariyon ke lekar koi charchaa nahin he
 However, it has been clarified that Chandrayaan-3 mission will be completed only on the basis of data received from Chandrayaan-2
 chandrayan-3 kii sambhavit taarikh 2024 thi lekin ab lag rahaa he ki is mishan main thodaa der ho saktaa he
 It is also possible that ISRO will ask other space agencies to make payloads
