 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar called the BJP and Narendra Modi a "trader of lies" and said that the BJP rally in Patna came into the limelight not because of the crowd but because of the terrorist blasts

 Nitish said that Narendra Modi cultivates lies, his rally was given the most protection
 unhone poocha ki 2008 ke dhamaakon ke baad narendra modi ne kitni jagahon kaa daura kiya tha or vah kitne pariwaron se mili the
 On the serial blasts in Patna, Modi criticized Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar as insensitive and said that at that time he was engrossed in fifty six in Rajgir
 pichley hafte ek raily ke dauraan narendra modi ne kaha tha ki bihar ke mukhyamantri ahamkaari hai
 Without naming Nitish, Modi said that despite the death of six people in Patna and more than 80 people injured, 'they' were enjoying a big banquet outside Patna and seemed happy

 He said that on being asked by the Bihar police officials engaged in law and order during the rally, it has come to light that no police official has forbidden any BJP leader to go there to address the rally in Gandhi Maidan
 Was
 rajnath singh ne kaha tha, "police adhikari unke paas aae or bataaya ki kuch visphot hue hai or main raily ko sambodhit nahin karun
 He said the same thing to Narendra Modi
 maine kaha - nahin, jo bhi ho, ham raily ko sambodhit karenge

 # sacredgames2, now streaming only on netflixa post shared bysacred Games (@sacredgames_tv) onaug 14, 2019 at 10:44 pm PDT Theory 1 Mumbai has been saved
 kyonki dilbagh kaa pattern kaam kar gaya he
 When Dilbag was putting his hand in Guruji's book, he was the only person who did not trust Guruji's dangerous plan
 to agar guruuji ko apana plan fail-sef bananaa tha to unhen pascode us pej par rakhana tha jis par dilbagh ke hand print the
 By that time Guruji did not know that Dilbag would kill Batya and Malcolm
 unhone dilbagh ko isliye maaraa tha taaki ve kisi ko is plan or code ko lekar kuch bataa naa paaen lekin sartaaj is code ko crack karne main kaamyaab ho jaataa he
 Theory 2 Sartaj may be saving the world, but he has completely joined Guruji's world and his cult
 wo kaaphi badal chukaa he or kahin naa kahin guruuji ke plan par vishwaas karne lagata he
 That is why he finally speaks ego brahmashmi
 guruuji ne gayatonde ko is kaam ke liye istemaal kiya tha kyonki guruuji mumbai ke saath hi gayatonde kaa balidaan chaahate the
 When you enter a new era, you have to sacrifice your closest and for Guruji it was Gaitonde
 lekin gayatonde khud ko maar chukaa he lekin sartaaj ke guruuji kii sena ko join karne ke baad se hi wo batya kaa sabase kareebi ho jaataa he
 Batya is a new guru in many ways
 to kahin naa kahin batya, sartaaj ko trick karti he or wo bomb ke paas jaataa he or chunki nai duniya main jane ke liye balidaan kii jarurat he to sartaaj, batya ke liye ye balidaan de detaa he or satyuga kii ruparekha taiyaar ho jaati he

 Minister Rajendra Pal Gautam said, 'the Ravidas temple was unveiled in 1959 by Babu Jagjivan Ram
 mandir samiti ne kisi bhi green belt ko atikaraman nahin kiya he
 He has alleged that the demolition of this temple reflects the mindset of the BJP
 yahi nahin 2014 main sarkaar banane ke baad hi pune, gujarat main daliton ke khilaaf hue maamle bhi bijepi kii maansikta ko darshata he
 He further states that 'rohit Vemula's murder is institutional murder

 Not from any one class
 vidhaan sabha se 500 kadam dur jahaan bhi ambedkar ne pravaas kiya tha, vahaan par bhavy smarak banaaya gaya he
 In such a situation, the opposition's charge on the issue of Ravidas temple is inspired by the politics of blackmail
 bataa den ravidaas mandir kaa cese mandir banaam didie ke saath chal rahaa tha or is maamle main didie ko court main jeet hasil hui thi
 After this the temple was demolished, but a new uproar began with it

 The Supreme Court has asked the Tamil Nadu State Government not to take any drastic action on farmers who have been loan defaulters
 court ne kaha ki aise kisaanon se lone recovery ke liye tay prakriya kaa paalan kiya janaa chahie
 There is a need to prevent such cases more important than giving compensation
 aisa koi tarika hona chahie jisase kathor ection hone par kisaan sarkaar se sampark kar saken
 The court asked the state government how to get rid of middlemen
 court is par bhi sunwaayee karegaa
 The next hearing will be held on August 4
 bichauliyon se kisaanon ko bachaane ke liye sarkaar gaanvon tak pahunche or dekhe ki sarkaar khud utpaadon ko kharide yaa phir sarkari afasar dekhen ki kisaanon ko nunatam samarthan mili
 During the first hearing, the Supreme Court had asked the Tamil Nadu government to make the farmers aware of the minimum support price for the crops so that the farmers of the state can take advantage of it and they can get the right price in the mandi
 supreme court ne ye nirdesh emics curi kii daleel par die the jisamen kaha gaya ki zyaadaatar kisaanon ko iske bare main jaankaree nahin he or 35 fisadi kisaan hi iskaa laabh uthaa paa rahe hai
 The court had asked the government to tell all the reports on 8 May, what steps the government is taking for the farmers
 court ne kaha ki philhal wo khudakushi ke mudde par nahin ja rahaa balki ye dekh rahaa he ki kisaanon ko sarkari yojanaon se puraa laabh dilaayaa ja saktaa he? In the last hearing, the Supreme Court had taken on the Tamil Nadu government in the case of farmer suicides
 supreme court ne tamilnadu sarkaar se poocha he ki rajya main kisaanon dwaara kii ja rahi khudakushi ko rokane ke liye kya kadam uthaae gaye hai
 The bench said that keeping quiet is not the solution
 tippaniyan The court said that due to financial constraints, the incident of suicides by farmers shocks any sensitive soul
 unhone kaha ki rajya apane nagarikon kaa abhibhavak hota he, isliye use apni praja kii bhalaai par dhyaan rakhana chahie
 Large number of farmers are committing suicide, the state should make every effort to stop it
 ek kalyankari rajya ke liye saamaajik nyaay behad ahm hota he
 The state government should consider such incidents as a natural disaster and find a way to prevent it
 justise deepak mishra kii adhyakshata vaali teen sadasyeey peeth ne kaha ki ham tamilnadu sarkaar se ummid karte hai ki vah agali taarikh par isse nipatane kii yojanaayen pesh karegi
 The Supreme Court is hearing a petition filed by an NGO
 jantar mantar par dharne par baithe kisaanon kii ore se bhi supreme court main arji daakhil kii gai he
 To save the farmers from the middlemen, the government reached the villages and saw whether the government bought the products themselves or the government officials should see that the farmers got minimum support
 pehle sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne tamilnadu sarkaar ko kaha tha ki wo fasalon ke liye nunatam samarthan mulya ke bare main kisaanon ko jaagruk kare taaki pradesh ke kisaan iskaa laabh uthaa saken or wo mandi main sahi daam paa saken
 The Supreme Court gave these instructions on the plea of amix Curie, which said that most of the farmers are not aware of it and only 35% farmers are able to take advantage of it
 court ne sarkaar ko kaha tha ki wo 8 may ko sari report bataaen ki kisaanon ke liye sarkaar kya kya kadam uthaa rahi he
 The court said that at the moment it is not going on the issue of suicide but is seeing that farmers can be given full benefits from government schemes? pichhali sunwaayee main kisaanon kii khudakushi ke maamle main supreme court ne tamilnadu sarkaar ko aade haathon liya tha
 The Supreme Court has asked the Tamil Nadu government what steps have been taken to prevent suicides by farmers in the state
 peeth ne kaha ki chup rahanaa samaadhaan nahin he
 The comments court ne kaha he ki aarthik tangi ke kaaran kisaanon dwaara khudakushi karne kii ghatana kisi bhi samvedansheel aatma ko jhakzor detaa he
 He said that the state is the guardian of its citizens, therefore it should take care of the well being of its subjects
 badi sankhya main kisaan khudakushi kar rahe hai, aise main rajya ko ise rokane ke liye harsambhav prayaas karnaa chahie
 Social justice is very important for a welfare state
 rajya sarkaar ko is tarah kii ghatnaon ko prakritik aapadaa maanate hue ise rokane ke liye tarika nikaalnaa chahie
 a three-member bench headed by Justice Deepak Mishra said that we expect the Tamil Nadu government to present plans to deal with it on the next date
 supreme court ek gaiyr sarkari sanghathan dwaara daayar yachika par sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 An application has also been filed in the Supreme Court on behalf of the farmers sitting on dharna at Jantar Mantar

 Senior BJP leader and Union Minister Vijay Goel is doing morning walk and talk with his supporters in Delhi's parks
 is walk and tok ke jariye wo logon ko ye samajhaana chaahate hai ki unki haveli kaa tex aam aadmi party ne nahin shahjahanabad board ne maaf kiya he
 Though the chief of the board is the chief minister himself, it has nothing to do with the Aam Aadmi Party and the party's claim of waiving his house tax is a blatant lie
 team kejariwal ne kholaa morchadarasal dilli ke mukhyamantri or aam aadmi party ke mukhiya arvind kejariwal in dinon dilli main jahaan bhi chunavi raily kar rahe hai vahaan jor-shor se house tex maafee kaa mudda uthaa rahe hai
 Kejriwal, who won the assembly elections by giving Delhi free water and cheap electricity, hopes that freeing house tax too will be a big issue
 bijepi-congress ne house tex muft karne par sawaal khadey kiye to kendriya mantrivijay goyal ke house tex maafeeki chitthee kejariwal and team ne media main dikhaa di ki agar vijay goyal kaa house tex maaf ho saktaa he to phir aam aadmi kaa kyon nahin ho saktaa
 About 13 lakh houses will be affected: About 13 lakh houses in Delhi will be affected by the house tax waiver, so this is a big issue in Delhi MCCD elections
 kejariwal ko pataa he ki muft-bijli-pani ke naare ne votaron ke ek khaas tabake ko sthaayee rup se aam aadmi party ke saath jod diya he lihaaja house tex free kar dena bhi party ke haq main ja saktaa he

 For the first time on Monday evening, Anna went to rest without giving any message

 Its effect on his health started showing from Monday morning itself

 Anna left the stage before time and went to rest

 The concern of the government increased as Anna's supporters swelled and his declining health, both stance and tone began to soften
 doctor maanate hai ki agar anna kaa anshan do din or chalaa, to unki sehat chintaa kaa vishay ban sakati he
 Health Minister Satendra Jain of the Kejriwal government, who attended the conference of Delhi Medical Association, taught all the government doctors in the capital how to avoid the dengue mosquito
 aapako bataa den ki dilli sarkaar or dilli medical association 20 agast ko rajdhani ke 500 skool main dengue kii rokthaam ko lekar jaagrukta campan karne ja rahe hai
 Dengue mosquito is a smart man
 In the party government, Health Minister Satendra Jain was seen in the conference of Delhi Medical Association on Sunday advising all government doctors to prevent dengue
 satyendra jain ne kaha kidengueka machhar bahut smart hota he
 Dengue mosquito does not like dirt, the noise of dengue is because high class people have more dengue
 unhone kaha ki tabiyat kharaab he, sirdard he to khub sara pani pien, pani kii kami na hone na den
 The biggest danger is those who eat medicine on their own without being shown to doctors
 aspataal ke andar doctor se marpet kaa maamla saamaanya baatsatendra jain sammelan main pahunche to dilli medical association ne aspataal ke andarmarijke parijanon dwaara doctor ke saath hone vaali marpet par swasthya mantri se sangyaan lene ke liye kaha
 Satyendra Jain said that the attack on the doctor inside the hospital is becoming a common thing in the last few years
 pichley dedh saal main is vajah se dilli sarkaar ke aspataal main 15 se 20 baar hadtaal ho chuki he
 The responsibility of saving the patient, the minister of God said that if the patient is not saved, the doctor is beaten
 isliye agar koi marij he, wo bachegaa yaa nahin ye pehle se pataa hona chahie, kyonki ye ek galatfahami he ki aspataal kii boundry main aane ke baad marij ajar amar ho gaye, aisa nahin he
 Our job is to try, treat
 marij ko bachaa paane kii jimmedaari bhagwaan kii he
 Satyendra said in the conference that fights with the doctor take place mostly at night
 jinamein zyaadaatar doctor yuva hote hai
 Therefore, there is a need to apply the duty of experienced senior doctor in night shift
 bengal main mukhyamantri mamata banerjee or rajyapal kesharinath treepathi ke bich baatcheet kaa masalaa itnaa haaavee ho gaya ki jin sampradayik ghatnaon ko lekar isaki naubat ai usee kaa detail saamne nahin aa rahaa he
 Everyday hundreds of messages are being written in the world of Facebook posts and whats up, hurting some religion
 jab yah logon ko pataa he to phir ye koun log hai jo bheed lekar sadakon par utar aate hai
 What concrete action is being taken against them
 aap yakeen karenge ki kolkata se 70 kimi dur baduria kii yah tasviir isliye he ki kisi ne fasebuk par post kiya he
 What we are raving to set an example of stupidity
 in logon ko kisne sadak par utaara, bajaae iske kanoon kaa rasta kyon nahin chunaa or intazaar kiya
 The BJP claims that 2000 Muslims have attacked Hindu families
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki kai dukaane jala di gayi hai or gharon par patharav kiya gaya he
 Our colleague Monidipa Banerjee had gone to a part of the area where the glass panes of the houses were broken, they were stoned and the belongings of a nearby club were destroyed
 logon ne monideepa ko bataaya ki ve kaaphi dare hue hai
 There are also reports of attacking the police station and burning police vehicles
 saansad kii gaadi par bhi hamalaa hua he
 It is difficult to understand who is doing what with whom but the spirit of the crowd is understood
 police is bheed ke aage bebas nazar aa rahi he
 Looks like a scuffle with someone in his presence
 sadakon par tair jalaae gaye hai
 The picture of Monadipa's report on Tuesday shows that there has been a lot of violence
 17 saal ke ladke kii post ke jawaab main jin logon ko utaara gaya, inamen se kai kishor umr ke nazar aa rahe hai
 This question has to be done about whether a Facebook post of a 17-year-old child will be set on fire in the city or locality, if the road is blocked then what will happen to the society
 kya hamaare sambandh itane khokhale ho chuke hai
 If the religious sentiment is hurting due to the Facebook post, then it means that the feelings have got sick
 ek baat sabhi ko yaad rakhni chahie
 Majority communalism is the difference between when minority communalism acts or something that can be done to provoke the majority in response to it by giving communal color
 bheed kaa jawaab bheed se dene vaale donon taraf ke log acchhee tarah se jaanate hai ki ve jawaab nahin de rahe hai balki ek-duusare kaa saath de rahe hai
 If Mamata Banerjee accuses the BJP governments of protecting communal violence against pro-government parties or groups, then what is Mamata Banerjee's own benchmark? unhone donon tatwon ke kilaaf kya karrwai kii he, ye bataanaa chahie na ki rajyapal ke saath hue vivaad ko pramukhataa deni chahie
 Appu Ethos Suresh did a brilliant reporting for the 'indian Express' before the Bihar elections
 21 agast 2015 kii is report main appu ne bataaya tha ki bijepi or jediu ke alag hone ke baad bihar main sampradayik hinsa teen-chauthai bad gai
 When the two were together, there were 226 incidents of communal violence across Bihar during the three and a half years
 june 2013 main donon alag hue or alag hone ke do saal ke andar sampradayik hinsa or tanaav kii 667 ghatnaayen darj kii gayi
 Most of the incidents started with the throwing of meat in the temple mosque
 nitish kumaar apane campan ke har bhaashan main kaha tha ki maance phenkane par mat bhadkiyegaa
 Mamta should learn from her own colleague
 'indian express' kii march 2014 kii ek report he jisamen police ricard kaa hawala dete hue bataaya gaya he ki gramin bengal main sampradayik jhagade bad gaye hai
 There are 12 incidents of communal violence reported in 2008, while in 2013 it increased to 106
 rashtriya aparaadh anveshan beuro ke aankade ke anusaar 2015 main desh ke 53 bade shaharon main dangon ke 6,270 cese darj hue hai, jisamen se kolkata main 293 cese darj kiye gaye
 The comments 2016 main bengal vidhansabha kaa chunaav hua tab mamata ko 211 siten aa gai or bijepi ko 3 seat mili, lekin har baar nuksaan nahin hoga isaki koi guarantee nahin he
 They should also take allegations of minority appeasement seriously and under the pretext of such allegations should also curb the politics of majority appeasement
 aisa lag rahaa he jaise koi bengal ko lagaataar ubaal par rakhana chahta he
 The scale of religious processions and yatras is being enlarged excessively
 in juluson ke zariye sadiyon puraane vahi dhol bajaae ja rahe hai ki laudspikar kii awaz tej thi yaa kisi ne maance phenk diya
 a part of Muslim society is also understanding this game, when Barkati, the royal Imam of Tipu Sultan Mosque in Kolkata, was removed from the post of Imam
 shahi imam barkati ke nijee album main un netaaon kii bhi tasviren hai jo unke bayanon ko lekar raajnneeti karte hai
 But in May, when this person said that we are Imams, nobody is a slave
 apni car se laal batti nahin utaarenge tab media main khub bayaanbazi hui
 The board of the local Muslim society and the mosque became cautious as to what kind of talk would be spread among the majority
 imam ko gaddi se utaar diya
 The Imam Saheb kept saying that he had the support of the Chief Minister, but could not save the throne
 baad main trinmul congress ke mantri ne bhi imam ke khilaaf masjid ke baahar pradarshan kiya
 The Imam gave a pro-pakistan statement
 is imam kaa yahi kaam tha ki kuch bayaan de do jisase bahes chhide or sampradayikta kaa khuraaq mili
 Many people's shop is run by such statements
 agar is tarah kii ghatnaon ko nazarandaaz kiya jaataa rahaa or samaaj ke bheetar se samaaj ke liye awaz nahin ai to log ek duusare ko pahchaanane or dua salaam karne laayak nahin bachenge
 You would believe that this picture of Baduriya, 70 km from Kolkata, is because someone posted on Facebook
 ham kya morrkhtaa kii misaal kaayam karne ke liye utaavle ho rahe hai
 Who did not get these people on the road, instead of choosing the path of the law and waited
 bijepi kaa daawa he ki 2000 musalamaanon ne hindu pariwaron par hamalaa kiya he
 It is being told that many shops have been burnt and stones have been stoned
 hamaari sahyogi monideepa banerjee is ilaake ke ek hisse main gai thim jahaan ke gharon ke shishe toote hue the, un par patharav kiya gaya tha or paas ke ek club ke saamaanon ko nasht kar diya gaya tha
 People told Monidipa that they are very scared
 police thane par hamalaa karne or police kii gaadiyaan jalaane kii bhi khabaren hai
 mp's car has also been attacked
 samajhnaa mushkil he ki koun kiske saath kya kar rahaa he lekin bheed kaa hausala samaj aa rahaa he
 The police seem helpless in front of this crowd
 uski maujuudagi main kisi ke saath hathapayee hoti lag rahi he
 Tires have been lit on the roads
 mangalvaar ko monadeepa kii report kii tasviir bataati he ki hinsa kaaphi hui he
 In response to a 17-year-old boy's post, many of those who were dropped appear to be of teenage age
 yah sawaal to karnaa hoga ki 17 saal ke ek bachche ke fasebuk post ko lekar kya shahar yaa mohalle main aagjanee kii jaaegi, rasta jam kiya jayega to phir samaaj kaa kya hoga
 Has our relationship become so hollow? fasebuk post ke kaaran dharmik bhaavana aahat ho rahi he to iskaa matlab he bhaawanaaon ko hi beemaari lag gai he
 One thing everyone should remember
 bahusankhyak sampradayikta isi firaaq main rahati he ki kab alpsankhyak sampradayikta harakat kare yaa kuch aisa kare jise sampradayik rang dekar uske jawaab main bahusnkhyakon ko uksaaya ja sake
 People on both sides who respond to the crowd are well aware that they are not responding but are supporting each other
 agar mamata banerjee bijepi kii sarkaron main sampradayik hinsa karne vaale sarkaar samarthak dalon yaa guton ko sangrakshan dene kaa aarope lagaati hai to khud mamata banerjee kaa apana benchmark kya he
 What action they have taken against both the elements, it should be told that the dispute with the governor should be given prominence
 bihar chunaav se pehle 'indian express' ke liye appu athos suresh ne ek shandaar reporting kii thi
 In this report of 21 August 2015, Appu stated that communal violence in Bihar increased three-quarters after the separation of BJP and JDU
 jab donon saath the to puure bihar main saadhe teen saal ke dauraan 226 sampradayik hinsa kii ghatana hui thi
 The two separated in June 2013 and within two years of separation, 667 incidents of communal violence and tension were reported
 zyaadaatar ghatnaayen mandir masjid main maance phenkane ko lekar shuru hui thim
 Nitish Kumar had said in every speech of his campaign that do not be provoked by throwing meat
 mamata ko apane hi sahyogi se sikh lenaa chahie

 Has our relationship become so hollow? fasebuk post ke kaaran dharmik bhaavana aahat ho rahi he to iskaa matlab he bhaawanaaon ko hi beemaari lag gai he
 One thing everyone should remember
 bahusankhyak sampradayikta isi firaaq main rahati he ki kab alpsankhyak sampradayikta harakat kare yaa kuch aisa kare jise sampradayik rang dekar uske jawaab main bahusnkhyakon ko uksaaya ja sake
 People on both sides who respond to the crowd are well aware that they are not responding but are supporting each other
 agar mamata banerjee bijepi kii sarkaron main sampradayik hinsa karne vaale sarkaar samarthak dalon yaa guton ko sangrakshan dene kaa aarope lagaati hai to khud mamata banerjee kaa apana benchmark kya he
 What action they have taken against both the elements, it should be told that the dispute with the governor should be given prominence

 They should also take allegations of minority appeasement seriously and under the pretext of such allegations should also curb the politics of majority appeasement

 a part of Muslim society is also understanding this game, when Barkati, the royal Imam of Tipu Sultan Mosque in Kolkata, was removed from the post of Imam
 shahi imam barkati ke nijee album main un netaaon kii bhi tasviren hai jo unke bayanon ko lekar raajnneeti karte hai
 But in May, when this person said that we are Imams, nobody is a slave
 apni car se laal batti nahin utaarenge tab media main khub bayaanbazi hui
 The board of the local Muslim society and the mosque became cautious as to what kind of talk would be spread among the majority
 imam ko gaddi se utaar diya
 The Imam Saheb kept saying that he had the support of the Chief Minister, but could not save the throne
 baad main trinmul congress ke mantri ne bhi imam ke khilaaf masjid ke baahar pradarshan kiya
 The Imam gave a pro-pakistan statement
 is imam kaa yahi kaam tha ki kuch bayaan de do jisase bahes chhide or sampradayikta kaa khuraaq mili
 Many people's shop is run by such statements

 She laughs that she could not get Shagan even in the marriage, because there was no cash in the house
 conot place main khariddaari karne aayin shilpi ko ek saal baad bank or atm ke baahar lagi line yaad aayin
 Shilpi said that she never felt the need to go to the bank, but even after demonetisation she still remembers how the lines of atms had to be installed
 neelam ko bhi bank kii line yaad aayi
 According to him, when her number did not come in the queue of the bank for a long time, she went to place someone else in the line to eat food
 aaj ek saal baad log notebandi ke dauraan hue anubhavon ko lekar chutki bhi lete hai
 The relief to the people is that after a year, they are not getting in line and now there is no shortage of cash
 lekin mahilaon ko khaastaur par shikaayat is baat kii he ki jo paisa unhone chupa chupa kar jamaa kiya tha, wo sab saamne aa gaya

 West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress President Mamata Banerjee's 'didigiri' on the resignation of Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi has once again put Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government in trouble
 sarkaar haalanki isse vichlit nahin hui he lekin apatkaaleen sthiti se nipatane ke liye vikalp ke rup main samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke vikalp ko vah gambheertha se le rahi he
 However, Dinesh Trivedi is still the railway minister of the country but there is a strong possibility that he can be the former railway minister tomorrow, day after tomorrow
 trivedi ne rail bajet main rail bajet main kiraaya vruddhi kii ghoshnaa kya kii, unke apane hi sabase bade virdohi ban gaye
 One cannot even imagine that on the next day of presenting the Railway Budget, the Railway Minister is smiling at the ongoing debate in Parliament over the speculation of his resignation and members of his own party sitting on a protest outside the Parliament Are
 rail mantri ne guuruuvaar ko saaf shabdon main kaha ki yadi pradhanmantri manmohan singh or party supremeo mamata banerjee ne unase istipha nahin maanga he yadi ve aisa karne ko kehete hai vah isamen tanik bhi deree nahin karenge
 However, the Prime Minister and the Trinamool Congress made it clear that Trivedi has not resigned
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki jarurat padi to is par vichaar kiya jayega jabaki loksabhaa main trinmul congress ke netaa sudeep bandopadhyaay ne sansad main kaha ki sarkaar ko koi khatra nahin he
 This statement of Sudeep Bandopadhyay certainly brought relief to the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, but when Sudeep Bandopadhyay came out of the House and faced reporters, Trivedi must go
 
 trinmul sansadeey dal ke netaa sudeep bandopadhyaay ne loksabhaa main kaha, 'main spasht karnaa chahta hum ki samprag dwitiya kii sarkaar puri tarah majboot sthiti main he or yah apana kaarykaal puraa karegi
 He also said that his party has not sought the resignation of Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi to present the fare hike budget
 srilanka mudde par vipaksh ke saath milakar sarkaar ko gherne vaali samprag kii ek anya mahatvapurn bhagidaar dravid munetra kadgam (diemke) ne bhi kaha ki vah manmohan singh sarkaar ke saath he
 Party MP T
 aar
 Baloo said, 'we are part of UPA II and will remain in it
 ' is bich, congress ne gathbandhan sahyogiyon ke saath matbhedon ko swaabhaavik qaraar dete hue kaha ki aisa pehle bhi hota rahaa he
 Party leader and Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Ambika Soni told reporters, 'all (coalition partners) have their political compulsions
 yah durbhagyapurna he, lekin netritv iskaa samaadhaan talash rahaa he
 Earlier, opposition parties in both houses of Parliament, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha created a ruckus, questioning the Railway Budget and the future of the Railway Minister
 trinmul congress dwaara kiraaya vruddhi waapas lene or dinesh trivedi ko hataane tathaa unki jagah mukul roy ko laane ke liye party adhyaksh va pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee dwaara pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko kiye gaye fax kii khabaron ke bich ve jaananaa chaahate the ki kya rail mantri ne pad se istipha de diya he?loksabhaa main pratipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj sahit vipaksh ke anya netaaon ne bhi is par ek notice jari kar prashnkaal sthagit karne tathaa sadan main is mudde par charchaa karaane kii maang kii
 There was a ruckus in the Rajya Sabha on this issue, due to which the proceedings of both the houses were interrupted
 in sabake bich sarkaar ne spasht kiya ki trivedi ne istipha nahin diya he
 Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, however, stated in the Lok Sabha that the government has received a letter from Mamta to withdraw the rail fare hike
 is mudde par hangaamaa kar rahe vipaksh se unhone yah bhi kaha ki ve 'ziddee bachche' kii tarah vyavhaar kar rahe hai
 Taking the responsibility of preparing the railway budget, Mukherjee also said that now it is in the House and she will take a decision on it
 trivedi ke sthaan par raay ko laane kii khabaron par pradhanmantri ne bhi sadhi hui pratikriya vyakt kii
 Speaking to reporters outside the Parliament House, he said, "if such situations are created then we will consider it
" 'trivedi ne guuruuvaar ko haalanki loksabhaa main kuch nahin kaha, lekin sadan ke baahar sanvvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main kaha ki pradhanmantri yaa mamata ne unhen istife ke liye nahin kaha he
 But if he is asked to resign, he will not delay at all
 mamata ke is daawey par ki unhen kiraaya vruddhi ke bare main jaankaree nahin thi, trivedi ne kaha, 'maine purv main iske sanket die the
 i will not say more than this, because i am a disciplined soldier of the party
 'isse pehle janata dal (united) ke adhyaksh sharad yadav ne kaha ki rail mantri dinesh trivedi ko pradhanmantri manmohan singh se salaah-mashvira kiye bagaiyr bajet pesh nahin karnaa chahie tha
 Meanwhile, Mamata Banerjee instructed the party mlas in Kolkata not to go against the party's stand
 trinmul vidhayak dal kii baithak ko sambodhit karte hue mamata ne party se mashvira kiye bagaiyr rail mantri trivedi dwaara yatri kiraye main vruddhi kiye jane par hairaani jataai
 a Trinamool MLA who attended the meeting said on condition of anonymity, "mamta said that if a member of the party breaks the party's rules and instructions, it will not be tolerated
 "trivedi ke is rukh se naaraaz mamata ne buudhvaar raat pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko patr likhaa
 Mamta in the letter asked the Prime Minister to make party MP Mukul Roy the railway minister in place of Trivedi
 ek anya vidhayak ne kaha, "baithak main didi ne hairaani jataai ki dinesh-da party ke khilaaf or bina is par baatcheet kiye yatri kiraye main vruddhi kaise kar sakate hai
 Didi said that the party would not tolerate indiscipline and rebellion
 " vidhayak ke mutabik, "didi ne kaha ki dinesh-da ne yadi rajdhani evam pratham shrenee ke kiraye main vruddhi kii hoti to yah thodaa tarksangat hota lekin sabhi shreniyon main kiraye main badhotaree aam-aadmi par boj daalegi
 The party cannot go against poor people
 "yatri kiraye main vruddhi karne ke baad kursi ganvaane ke khatre kaa saamana kar rahe rail mantri dinesh trivedi ko apni party trinmul congress ke ek saansad kaa sahaara mila he
 MP Kabir Suman on Thursday supported the increase in fares and said that the Railway Minister is not the property of the party
 rail bajet main yatri kiraye main kii gai vruddhi or is par trinmul congress ke rukh ne pehle se hi mamata banerjee se aajeej aa chuki ko congress ko vikalp talashne ko majaboor kar diya
 He is eyeing SP
 sapa bhi centre kaa samarthan kar rajya main apni sthiti ko majboot karnaa chaahati he
 In such a situation, when both need each other, the Congress is also considering the option of overthrowing Mamata Banerjee
 in sab kintu-parantu ke bich nirnay congress, sapa or trinmul ko lenaa he lekin baavjood iske ek vyakti jisaki gardan katni tay he vah he dinesh trivedi

 He clearly says that the government cares about Kashmir but its attitude towards Kashmiris is under question

 is par kisi ko bhi soch samajhakar bolnaa chahie
 You have to win the heart of Kashmiris
 aisa nahin ho saktaa ki aapako kashmir to chaiye par kashmiri nahin
 Ever since the government of two mismatched ideologies was formed in Jammu and Kashmir, the situation there has deteriorated
 saath hi main ye bhi kahuunga ki meri sena or biguef ke saath puri sahanubhuti he
 Question- BJP ministers say, are you dropping the morale of the army by tweeting this? Answer- First, look at the BJP ministers who are saying this
 gaur kiijie wo sabhi jammu kshetra ke hai, jabaki masalaa kashmir ghati kaa he
 These people are spoiling the atmosphere by giving a statement
 centre or rajya sarkaron ko milakar is mudde par gambhirtha se kadam uthaanaa chahie
 Question- Why did you say that Prime Minister Modi can get Pakistan to go to war to win elections? Answer- Yes, of course i said because the country's economy is falling, GDP is falling

 Love Jihad, triple divorce is not an issue according to me
 naa to aise muddon par bahes honi chahie or naa hi ise chunavi mudda bananaa chahie
 The triple talaq case should not be taken in court either, the Muslim community should be allowed to decide on it
 meraa maananaa he ki muslim samudaay is mudde par khud faisla kare or vahi tay kare ki muslim mahilaon ke hit main kya he
 Whether or not they should move on from the orthodox traditions like the old triple talaq
 sawaal- prasiddh gayak sonu nigam ne twit kiya he ki ajaan ke vakt laudspikar chalane se unki neend kharaab hoti he yah ek tareeke kii gundgardee he, aap kya kahenge?jawaab- dekhie aise logon ke liye main sirf yahi kahuunga ki aise log satta se nikatataa chaahane ke liye aise bayaan dete hai

 phir khulaa lipstick under maay burka kaa maamla, kya hogi relies! The 26th issue of the University Series will take you to Dayal Singh College of Delhi University
 dayaal singh majithia koun the, ye jaanane ke liye hamane Hey prakaashan se chhapi unki jeevani The Life And Times Of Dayal Singh Majithia mangai to us kitaab ki pehali pankti isi baat se shuru hoti he ki sardaar dayaal singh majithia bhartiya upmahadweep main paidaa hue shaayad iklaute shaks hai jinaki jeevani bharat or pakistan donon sarkaron ne prakashit kii he
 i have been looking at Dayal Singh College located on Lodhi Road in Delhi for twenty years, but i have not noticed who Dayal Singh Majithia is
 punjab ke sher maharaja ranjit singh ke khandaan se jude rahe hai
 Even after being a royal family, Dayal Singh chose another path in his life
 dayaal singh ne ek aise andolan kaa netritv kiya jiske nattejey main 1882 main punjab uniwarsity mili
 Today the condition of Punjab University is also not very good and the condition of this college in Delhi named after them is also not very good
 jab 1884 main madras main thiosophical sosayadi of india kii baithak main dayaal singh majithia bhi the, jisamen bhartiya rashtriya congress kii sthapana kaa nirnay liya gaya tha
 This book of 199 rupees tells a wonderful story of the biography of Dayal Singh Majithia
 punjab neshnal bank to apane gharon ke aasapaas aapane dekha hi hoga, us bank ke pehle or aaajeevan chairman rahe
 Punjab National Bank was the first bank run by Indians
 jis samay unki haisiyat ke amir gurudwara, mandir bana rahe the, dayaal singh majithia bank bana rahe the, uniwarsity bana rahe the, congress kii sthapana karne waalon main shaamil ho rahe the, ek akhbaar da tribune kaayam kar rahe the jo 125 saal se adhik samay se hamaare bich aaj tak chalaa aa rahaa he
 Donate all his capital to a trust so that the college, library and newspaper can run
 mashhoor chitrakaar amrutha shergill bhi inhen ke khandaan kii rahi hai, jinke naam par dayaal singh college se hi thodi duuri par amrutha shergill maarg he
 Dayal Singh left the jagirs, Rajwada and entered the business world
 lahore main angrejon ke barrack kii jameen kharid kar unke afasaron ke liye makaan banaaya
 Before his death in 1898, he had considerable property in Lahore
 unke jivan kaal main bengal main brahmon samaaj kaa kaaphi jor the, dayaal singh uske asar main aae or brahmon samaaj kaa bhi kaaphi prasar kiya
 The story of extracting the Tribune newspaper is also very good in this book
 kolkata main amrit bazaar patrika, madras main hindu or lahore main di tribune
 The three axes became that of the nationalist press
 tab lahore main angrezi bolne vaale bhi bahut kam the, phir bhi dayaal singh apane iraade se peeche nahin hate
 From 1906, this newspaper became a daily
 angrezon ke liye bhartiya mat kaa pratinidhi ban gaya
 This newspaper played an important role in social reform and freedom struggle
 dayaal singh majithiya ne apane sampadakon ke kaam main kabhi dakhal nahin diya
 When he faced defamation during his lifetime, all the witnesses during the investigation also confirmed that Dayal Singh Majithia never interfered in the work of the editor
 di tribune akhbaar angrezi hukumat ke daur main satta virdohi tewaron ke liye mashhoor ho gaya tha
 The news of the 1893 session of the Lahore Congress was fiercely printed, making the British rule look lost
 lahore ke government college ke principal ne college kii librari main tribune par roak laga di thi
 The farewell article he wrote in the Tribune after Congress founder AO Hume returned to London is worth reading
 is vyakti ke jivan kaa ek-ek lamhaa shandaar he
 The first Indian bank was established in Punjab
 19 may, 1894 ko lahore ke anaarakali market main iskaa daftar kaayam hua
 It is written in the history of Punjab National Bank that Bengali, Parsi formed a bank with Punjabi who was truly Indian
 20veen sadi ke bharat ne jo badlaav dekhe, uski buniyaad sardaar dayaal singh majithia jaise log rakh rahe the
 Dayal Singh Majithia died in 1898
 unka itnaa parichay na diya jaataa to dilli ke dayaal singh sandhya college kaa naam badal kar vande maataram karne ke faisle kaa marm samaj nahin aata
 By the way, since 1965, Missionary College has been running in Ernakulam, Kerala, named Bharat Mata College
 vande maataram college hone main bhi koi dikkat nahin he, magar dayaal singh majithia ke yogadan kaa khyaal kiya ja saktaa tha
 The chairman says that two colleges cannot run in the same name
 lekin ek campus main ek saath do college chalaane ke bhi kya tuk hai
 Evening colleges in Delhi have given a lot of support to the people who came after partition
 ve din main kaam karte rahe or shaam ko padhai
 The process of bringing the evening college to dawn has been going on for the last three years
 sabase pehle deshbandhu college sandhya ko subah laakar uskaa naam ramanujam college kiya gaya
 MLA Manjeet Singh Sirsa says that the name cannot be changed, Amitabh Sinha, chairman of the management committee, says that the name can be changed
 sirsa kaa kahana he ki jab dilli uniwarsity ne is college ko techover kiya tha tab samjhauta patr main likhaa tha ki naam dayaal singh college hi rahegaa
 Till now, Akali Dal leaders have not spoken
 kya badal parivaar sirsa ke in sawaalon kaa saath degaa
 There is no opposition to the issue of changing the name, there is opposition to the simultaneous college of two shifts
 shikshak bhi sawaal uthaa rahe hai or chaatr bhi
 There is also a Dayal Singh College in Lahore, Pakistan, which has not been renamed yet
 aap kisi bhi party kii koi bhi sarkaar le lijie, unki sarkaar ke bees saal le lijie yaa das saal le lijie, har jagah collejon kii haalat karaab milegi
 Surprisingly, students and teachers never saw this as a widespread problem
 dayaal singh college ke chaatr buniyadi suvidhaon ko lekar mukhar ho rahe hai
 Dayal Singh College is indeed the largest college in low space
 11 acre kaa bhi campus nahin he magar subah kii paali main yahaan 6000 bachche padhate hai
 3000 students study in the evening shift
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki donon paali mila dene se ek campus main ek vakt main 9000 chaatr ho jaaenge
 Classes are going on by creating small rooms on the second floor
 is tarah ke saat aath kamare hai
 There are eight benches in which many twenty students can come, even the whole class cannot attend it
 chaatr baahar khadey hokar lacture sun rahe hote hai
 Do not see the fan of this class room
 ummiido se labalab hokar bees puri kha lenge
 They are usually used for tutorials that have 15–20 children
 magar jagah kii itani kami he ki kabhi-kabhi in chote kamare main bhi general class alot kar diya jaataa he, jisamen 70 se 100 chaatr hote hai
 In that case, students have to stand outside
 bhugol kii prayogshaala itani choti he, class main 70-80 chaatr hote hai magar yahaan 30 se adhik ke baithne kii jagah nahin he
 a lab assistant's room has been built in the corner of this room
 lab ke andar filein rakhane ke liye daraaj kii jagah nahin he
 They have been placed in place of stairs
 zaahir he unke aane jane kii jagah sankari hoti hogi jo suraksha ke lihaaz se kaaphi khataranaak he
 The class room in the college basement is half store room and half is class room
 store room vaale hisse main pariksha ke parche bikhare pade hai
 There is no place to put a door here, a wall has been built from Alamira, but the teacher's voice from the second class keeps on coming here
 hamane jis vakt shooting kii us vakt chaatr nahin the, varna hamen bataaya gaya ki jab college khulaa hota he to is coridor main paanv dharne kii jagah nahin hoti he
 Those who are passionate about changing the name of Dayal Singh College have also woken up late
 unhen kabhi apni bhavukta kaa istemaal is college kaa haal badalane ke liye bhi karnaa chahie tha
 The Delhi University has consistently ignored this college
 6000 chaatro ke liye yahaan 255 teacher hai
 Permanentes are about 166, the rest 90 adhawks
 shaam kii paali main 85-90 hi teacher hai
 Evening College has more temporary teachers than permanent
 edock shikshakon kii samasya par kisi kaa dhyaan nahin jaataa he
 The staff room is quite small for teachers
 ek saath 100 shikshak bhi nahin baith sakate hai
 You can understand what will happen in the crowd here for the preparation of the next class
 ham shikshakon ko ye suvidha denge or chahenge ki ve hamen world class college banaakar de den
 It is also a disaster to haul the giant attendant register, teachers do not even have their shelves to keep it
 kitaaben bhi ghar se dhokar lani hoti he
 Seeing the condition of the locker, you can understand what happens
 shikshakon ke shauchalay kii bheetar se to sthiti thik he magar sankhya ke hisaab se bahut kam he
 There are toilets inside the staff room
 kisi shikshak ke paas apana koi spes nahin he
 The English department has been given a separate small room
 usamen aath log bhi saath nahin baith sakate, jabaki english department main 21 shikshak hai
 It is a matter of fact that there is already a heavy burden on the basic facilities of Dayal Singh College and by adding two shifts this pressure will increase further
 shaam kii paali ke college ke liye alag se imaarat ban rahi he magar puri nahin hui he
 Students and teachers say that in such a situation mara-mari will prevail
 pehle hi yahaan auditorium or seminar room main bhi class chalati he
 The auditorium for 6000 students can seat only 186 students
 khel kaa maidan bhi chota ho gaya, kyonki kuch zamin metro main chali gai
 After the agitation in 2008, the Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India, promised to provide land next door but did not
 khel ke maamle main dayaal singh college kii dhooma he, magar ab us par asar pad rahaa he
 Principal of morning shift says that Dayal Singh College is the worst college of Delhi University in terms of infrastructure per student
 tippaniyan Colleges generally do not have room for a chairman
 is college ke conference room main chairman ne apane liye cameraa bana liya he or nem plate laga he
 For the first time in Delhi University, there is room in the college for a chairman
 jis college main seminar room main class chalata ho vahaan ke conference room ko chairman ke offis main badal diya gaya he
 The chairman of the management committee Amitabh Sinha is a member of the BJP and is also a lawyer
 unka kahana he is college main principal or shikshakon ke bich jhagada hota rahata he
 The teacher does not want to go to the principal's room, so has made his room
 jab ve nahin hote hai to conference ho sakati he
 But the teachers say that this is not correct
 har college main shikshak or principal ke bich thodaa bahut vivaad hota he, magar is str kaa nahin hota ki use sulajhane ke liye chairman ko college main apana daftar bananaa pade
 College sources revealed that the conference room used to be used, meaning it is now being used as an office
 amitabh kaa yah bhi kahana he ki shaam kii paali ke chaatro ke hiton kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana hoga
 The evening shift does not have the credibility of the college, so they could not get a job
 vaise koi yah bataa detaa ki kis morning ke college ke chaatro ko kitni naukariyaan milti hai to admician lene main chaatro ke liye bhi suvidha ho jaati
 There is power in the morning and evening
 iskaa samaadhaan nikaalnaa hoga magar chaatro ke sawaalon ko vande maataram ke naam kii bahes main nahin uljhaana chahie
 If there is a class room, teachers should come to teach
 199 rupee kii yah kitaab dayaal singh majithia kii jeevani ke laajawab kisse bataati he
 You must have seen Punjab National Bank around your homes, been the first and life chairman of that bank
 punjab neshnal bank bharatiyon ke dwaara chalaaya jane vaala pehla bank tha
 At the time, the wealthy Gurudwaras of his status were building temples, Dayal Singh Majithia was building a bank, building a university, joining the founders of Congress, a newspaper The Tribune which was over 125 years Time has been running among us till date
 apni sari kamai puunji daan kar ek trust bana diya taaki college, librari or akhbaar chalata rahe
 Famous painter Amrita Shergill has also been the father of these, whose name is Amrita Shergill Marg, a short distance from Dayal Singh College
 rajawada, jaagiren chhodkar dayaal singh bijness kii duniya main aa gaye
 In Lahore, the British bought land in the barracks and built houses for their officers
 1898 main marane se pehle lahore main unki kaaphi sampatti ho gai thi
 During his lifetime, Brahmos society was very strong in Bengal, Dayal Singh came under his influence and spread Brahmos society too
 tribune akhbaar nikaalane kaa kissa bhi is kitaab main koob he
 Amrit Bazar Patrika in Kolkata, Hindu in Madras and The Tribune in Lahore
 teen dhuree ban gaye rashtravaadi press ke
 Then there were very few English speakers in Lahore, yet Dayal Singh did not back down from his intentions
 1906 se yah akhbaar dainik ho gaya

 It has to be resolved but the questions of the students should not be confused in the debate in the name of Vande Mataram
 class room to ho, padhaane ke liye shikshak to aa jaaen
 Till now, Akali Dal leaders have not spoken
 kya badal parivaar sirsa ke in sawaalon kaa saath degaa
 There is no opposition to the issue of changing the name, there is opposition to the simultaneous college of two shifts
 shikshak bhi sawaal uthaa rahe hai or chaatr bhi
 There is also a Dayal Singh College in Lahore, Pakistan, which has not been renamed yet
 aap kisi bhi party kii koi bhi sarkaar le lijie, unki sarkaar ke bees saal le lijie yaa das saal le lijie, har jagah collejon kii haalat karaab milegi
 Surprisingly, students and teachers never saw this as a widespread problem
 dayaal singh college ke chaatr buniyadi suvidhaon ko lekar mukhar ho rahe hai
 Dayal Singh College is indeed the largest college in low space
 11 acre kaa bhi campus nahin he magar subah kii paali main yahaan 6000 bachche padhate hai
 3000 students study in the evening shift
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki donon paali mila dene se ek campus main ek vakt main 9000 chaatr ho jaaenge
 Classes are going on by creating small rooms on the second floor
 is tarah ke saat aath kamare hai
 There are eight benches in which many twenty students can come, even the whole class cannot attend it
 chaatr baahar khadey hokar lacture sun rahe hote hai
 Do not see the fan of this class room
 ummiido se labalab hokar bees puri kha lenge
 They are usually used for tutorials that have 15–20 children
 magar jagah kii itani kami he ki kabhi-kabhi in chote kamare main bhi general class alot kar diya jaataa he, jisamen 70 se 100 chaatr hote hai
 In that case, students have to stand outside
 bhugol kii prayogshaala itani choti he, class main 70-80 chaatr hote hai magar yahaan 30 se adhik ke baithne kii jagah nahin he
 a lab assistant's room has been built in the corner of this room
 lab ke andar filein rakhane ke liye daraaj kii jagah nahin he
 They have been placed in place of stairs
 zaahir he unke aane jane kii jagah sankari hoti hogi jo suraksha ke lihaaz se kaaphi khataranaak he
 The class room in the college basement is half store room and half is class room
 store room vaale hisse main pariksha ke parche bikhare pade hai
 There is no place to put a door here, a wall has been built from Alamira, but the teacher's voice from the second class keeps on coming here
 hamane jis vakt shooting kii us vakt chaatr nahin the, varna hamen bataaya gaya ki jab college khulaa hota he to is coridor main paanv dharne kii jagah nahin hoti he
 Those who are passionate about changing the name of Dayal Singh College have also woken up late
 unhen kabhi apni bhavukta kaa istemaal is college kaa haal badalane ke liye bhi karnaa chahie tha
 The Delhi University has consistently ignored this college
 6000 chaatro ke liye yahaan 255 teacher hai
 Permanentes are about 166, the rest 90 adhawks
 shaam kii paali main 85-90 hi teacher hai
 Evening College has more temporary teachers than permanent
 edock shikshakon kii samasya par kisi kaa dhyaan nahin jaataa he
 The staff room is quite small for teachers
 ek saath 100 shikshak bhi nahin baith sakate hai
 You can understand what will happen in the crowd here for the preparation of the next class
 ham shikshakon ko ye suvidha denge or chahenge ki ve hamen world class college banaakar de den
 It is also a disaster to haul the giant attendant register, teachers do not even have their shelves to keep it
 kitaaben bhi ghar se dhokar lani hoti he
 Seeing the condition of the locker, you can understand what happens
 shikshakon ke shauchalay kii bheetar se to sthiti thik he magar sankhya ke hisaab se bahut kam he
 There are toilets inside the staff room
 kisi shikshak ke paas apana koi spes nahin he
 The English department has been given a separate small room
 usamen aath log bhi saath nahin baith sakate, jabaki english department main 21 shikshak hai
 It is a matter of fact that there is already a heavy burden on the basic facilities of Dayal Singh College and by adding two shifts this pressure will increase further
 shaam kii paali ke college ke liye alag se imaarat ban rahi he magar puri nahin hui he
 Students and teachers say that in such a situation mara-mari will prevail
 pehle hi yahaan auditorium or seminar room main bhi class chalati he
 The auditorium for 6000 students can seat only 186 students
 khel kaa maidan bhi chota ho gaya, kyonki kuch zamin metro main chali gai

 Principal of morning shift says that Dayal Singh College is the worst college of Delhi University in terms of infrastructure per student
 tippaniyan Colleges generally do not have room for a chairman
 is college ke conference room main chairman ne apane liye cameraa bana liya he or nem plate laga he
 For the first time in Delhi University, there is room in the college for a chairman
 jis college main seminar room main class chalata ho vahaan ke conference room ko chairman ke offis main badal diya gaya he
 The chairman of the management committee Amitabh Sinha is a member of the BJP and is also a lawyer
 unka kahana he is college main principal or shikshakon ke bich jhagada hota rahata he
 The teacher does not want to go to the principal's room, so has made his room
 jab ve nahin hote hai to conference ho sakati he
 But the teachers say that this is not correct
 har college main shikshak or principal ke bich thodaa bahut vivaad hota he, magar is str kaa nahin hota ki use sulajhane ke liye chairman ko college main apana daftar bananaa pade
 College sources revealed that the conference room used to be used, meaning it is now being used as an office
 amitabh kaa yah bhi kahana he ki shaam kii paali ke chaatro ke hiton kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana hoga
 The evening shift does not have the credibility of the college, so they could not get a job
 vaise koi yah bataa detaa ki kis morning ke college ke chaatro ko kitni naukariyaan milti hai to admician lene main chaatro ke liye bhi suvidha ho jaati
 There is power in the morning and evening
 iskaa samaadhaan nikaalnaa hoga magar chaatro ke sawaalon ko vande maataram ke naam kii bahes main nahin uljhaana chahie
 If there is a class room, teachers should come to teach
 aap kisi bhi party kii koi bhi sarkaar le lijie, unki sarkaar ke bees saal le lijie yaa das saal le lijie, har jagah collejon kii haalat karaab milegi
 Surprisingly, students and teachers never saw this as a widespread problem
 dayaal singh college ke chaatr buniyadi suvidhaon ko lekar mukhar ho rahe hai
 Dayal Singh College is indeed the largest college in low space
 11 acre kaa bhi campus nahin he magar subah kii paali main yahaan 6000 bachche padhate hai
 3000 students study in the evening shift
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki donon paali mila dene se ek campus main ek vakt main 9000 chaatr ho jaaenge
 Classes are going on by creating small rooms on the second floor
 is tarah ke saat aath kamare hai
 There are eight benches in which many twenty students can come, even the whole class cannot attend it
 chaatr baahar khadey hokar lacture sun rahe hote hai
 Do not see the fan of this class room
 ummiido se labalab hokar bees puri kha lenge
 They are usually used for tutorials that have 15–20 children
 magar jagah kii itani kami he ki kabhi-kabhi in chote kamare main bhi general class alot kar diya jaataa he, jisamen 70 se 100 chaatr hote hai
 In that case, students have to stand outside
 bhugol kii prayogshaala itani choti he, class main 70-80 chaatr hote hai magar yahaan 30 se adhik ke baithne kii jagah nahin he
 a lab assistant's room has been built in the corner of this room
 lab ke andar filein rakhane ke liye daraaj kii jagah nahin he
 They have been placed in place of stairs
 zaahir he unke aane jane kii jagah sankari hoti hogi jo suraksha ke lihaaz se kaaphi khataranaak he
 The class room in the college basement is half store room and half is class room
 store room vaale hisse main pariksha ke parche bikhare pade hai
 There is no place to put a door here, a wall has been built from Alamira, but the teacher's voice from the second class keeps on coming here
 hamane jis vakt shooting kii us vakt chaatr nahin the, varna hamen bataaya gaya ki jab college khulaa hota he to is coridor main paanv dharne kii jagah nahin hoti he
 Those who are passionate about changing the name of Dayal Singh College have also woken up late
 unhen kabhi apni bhavukta kaa istemaal is college kaa haal badalane ke liye bhi karnaa chahie tha
 The Delhi University has consistently ignored this college
 6000 chaatro ke liye yahaan 255 teacher hai
 Permanentes are about 166, the rest 90 adhawks
 shaam kii paali main 85-90 hi teacher hai
 Evening College has more temporary teachers than permanent
 edock shikshakon kii samasya par kisi kaa dhyaan nahin jaataa he
 The staff room is quite small for teachers
 ek saath 100 shikshak bhi nahin baith sakate hai
 You can understand what will happen in the crowd here for the preparation of the next class
 ham shikshakon ko ye suvidha denge or chahenge ki ve hamen world class college banaakar de den
 It is also a disaster to haul the giant attendant register, teachers do not even have their shelves to keep it
 kitaaben bhi ghar se dhokar lani hoti he
 Seeing the condition of the locker, you can understand what happens
 shikshakon ke shauchalay kii bheetar se to sthiti thik he magar sankhya ke hisaab se bahut kam he
 There are toilets inside the staff room
 kisi shikshak ke paas apana koi spes nahin he
 The English department has been given a separate small room
 usamen aath log bhi saath nahin baith sakate, jabaki english department main 21 shikshak hai
 It is a matter of fact that there is already a heavy burden on the basic facilities of Dayal Singh College and by adding two shifts this pressure will increase further
 shaam kii paali ke college ke liye alag se imaarat ban rahi he magar puri nahin hui he
 Students and teachers say that in such a situation mara-mari will prevail
 pehle hi yahaan auditorium or seminar room main bhi class chalati he
 The auditorium for 6000 students can seat only 186 students
 khel kaa maidan bhi chota ho gaya, kyonki kuch zamin metro main chali gai
 After the agitation in 2008, the Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India, promised to provide land next door but did not

 But there is such a shortage of space that sometimes even in these small rooms, the general class is allotted, which consists of 70 to 100 students
 waisi sthiti main chaatro ko baahar khadey rahanaa padataa he
 The lab of Geography is so small, there are 70-80 students in the class but there is no more than 30 seats

 We were not students at the time of shooting, otherwise we were told that when the college is open, there is no place to walk in this corridor

 The problem of adhoc teachers goes unnoticed

 Not even 100 teachers can sit together

 We will give this facility to the teachers and would like them to make us World Class Colleges
 bhimkaay atendence register ko dhonaa bhi afat kaa kaam he, use rakhane ke liye bhi shikshakon ke paas apni aalmaari tak nahin he

 The condition of the teachers' toilets is fine from within but it is very less according to the number

 zyaadaatar garib parivaar mahange daam main phir se gas bharaane main asamarth hote hai, isliye badi sankhya main silendar riphiling ke liye baahar nahin aa pate
 Now the top petroleum company Indian Oil has found a solution

 Also, the price of refilling in a large cylinder is Rs 783, while the refilling for a small cylinder weighing 5 kg will be Rs 350
 itani kam raashi kii vyavastha karnaa kai logon ke liye aasaan ho saktaa he
 Indian Oil chairman Sanjeev Singh says that after implementing the small cylinder scheme, this system will be introduced at some selected locations first
 unhone kaha, "ek chote silendar kii jamaanat raashi 800 rupee hoti he jabaki bade silendar ke liye yahi raashi 1,250 rupee ho jaati he
 The big cylinder has a security of Rs 1,250 which the center gives as a grant
 is tarah se 2 chote silendaron kii security 1,600 rupee baithti he
 There is a difference of Rs 350 on the security of both the cylinders
 centre se abhi is antar ko lekar baat chal rahi he
 In the meantime, if a customer deposits Rs 350, then he can be given 2 small cylinders

 Do you remember? Winter nights of December 2012
 raisina hills par jamaa hue log
 The country shouted slogans for Nirbhaya's justice
 balaatkaar ke kilaaf sazaa sakht karne kii maang
 Everyone had one intention, everyone had a tricolor in their hands
 kitni jaldi, kitna kuch badal diya tha aapane, lekin uske baad se lekar aaj tak kitna kuch badal gaya he
 Do you remember? When the girl was raped in Kathua, Jammu, people came on the road to save the accused
 maar di gai bacchee ke liye afsos tak nahin hua
 The tricolor was also in the procession for the rapist
 kya aapako yaad he?kya bijepi netaa chinmayanand ke maamle main log chup hai
 Why is there no restlessness in the society as it was during Nirbhaya
 kya balaatkaar ke maamle main sakriyata is baat se nirbhar hone lagi he ki aaropee kaa mazahab kya he? jaise trol karne vaale kaushambi main balaatkaar kii ghatana ko lekar anaap shanaap likh rahe hai, is cese main aaropee kaa mazahab kuch or he
 But none of them is asking why Chinmayananda has not been arrested
 bijepi ke purv saansad or purv grih rajya mantri chinmayanand ke maamle kii story media ke liye badi khabar nahin he
 There is also the victim, who has been arrested by the police for demanding extortion money from Chinmayananda
 esaiti ne ek press conference main kaha ki rangadari maangane kaa video forencik jaanch main sahi niklaa he
 This video has been given to SIT by Chinmayananda
 esaiti ke anusaar ladki ne apana gunaah kabool kar liya he

 Photo of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 yah poster saansad arun kumaar sagar kii taraf se lagaaya gaya he, usamen chinmayanand kya kar rahe hai agar vah party main nahin hai to?peedita ne bhi esaiti ko 43 video die the
 Most videos have been found to be correct in the forensic investigation
 peedita ne aarope lagaaya he ki lau college main admician karaane main madad kii thi, lekin nahaate vakt kaa video banaaya or phir chinmayanand ne blackmel karnaa shuru kar diya
 They were allegedly sent messages in the morning for massage and afternoon for sex
 yah sab esaiti ke paas he
 The victim has also alleged that Chinmayananda's guards used to take him from the hostel at gunpoint
 abhi tak un guard kii giraftaar kii koi soochna nahin he
 There is no information about his license being seized
 police ne chinmayanand ko giraftaar to kiya magar hiraasat main lekar jaanch kii maang nahin kii
 The SIT said it did not need to, as nothing was found from them
 aaj sipiem netaa vrinda karaat or subhashini ali shahjahanpur pahunchi

 376c has been levied against him
 is dhara main yon shoshan or balaatkaar main fark kiya gaya he
 If an officer lures a subordinate woman, sexually abuses her, sexually using her chair to establish a sexual relationship, she will not be considered rape

 376 charges in the rape case
 jisamen adhiktam aaajeevan karawas kii sazaa he
 At the same time, another accused in the murder of Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh, but also the main accused Yogesh Raj, was granted bail by the Allahabad High Court
 hatya se pehle ek video he, jisamen yogesh raaj inspector subodh kumaar singh se ulajh rahaa he
 Yogesh was made the main accused of inciting violence in the whole case
 isi yogesh raaj ne muslim samudaay ke 7 logon ke khilaaf juthi exiaar karai thi jise baad main police ne bhi mana tha ki galat he
 Now he will be out on bail
 3 disambar, 2018 ko inspector subodh kumaar singh ko kulhadi se maar kar zakhmi kiya gaya or phir unke hi sarvice revolver se goli maar di gai
 a total of 44 people were arrested in this ten month old case, out of which more than 20 accused have come out on bail

 udhar, punjab and maharashtra koparative bank limited ke 50 hazaar se adhik khataadharakon ko aaj kuch raahat di gai he lekin kya wo raahat he? raahat yah he ki pehle aadesh aayaa ki 6 maheene main ek hazaar hi nikaal sakenge, ab aadesh aayaa he ki 6 maheene main 10,000 hazaar hi nikaal sakate hai
 Is this relief really? reserve bank kaa daawa he ki nae aadesh se 60 pratishat khataadharakon ko puri rakam nikaalane kaa mauka milegaa
 It is obvious that those with less money have been given relief, but what is the crime of those who have more money? Why should their money stay in the bank? Has the bank deteriorated due to account holders? If someone is married here, there are two lakhs deposited in the account, can he be happy by withdrawing 10,000 in six months? This can only happen when the news of Pakistan and Ram temple only goes on TV, but even then the date of marriage will come from its time
 vah vyakti jo rose pakistan or ram mandir par kaarykram dekh rahaa he, use shaadi ke liye paise kii zarurat to hogi hi
 The Reserve Bank today suspended the director and chairman of PMC Bank

 faijabad ke mumtaznagar kii ramlila beete 50 saalon se saamudayik sauhardra kii pratik bani hui he
 From managing the Ramlila in the populous area to the majority of Muslims, the main roles have been dominated by Muslims
 ab muslim nahin kar sakate mukhya bhoomikaayenhaalanki pichley do saalon se muslimon ko mukhya kirdaar jaise, (ram, sita, lakshmana or hanuman) karne se manaa kar diya gaya he
 Behind this, the habit of eating meat of Muslims is being blamed
 ramlila cameti ke president majid ali ke mutabik, 'kuch sthaneey logon ne ramlila main muslimon dwaara lead role karne par aitraaj jataayaa tha
 He said that Muslims eat meat, so they should not play the role of God
 jab hamen unki aapattiyon kaa pataa chalaa to hamane unka samaadhaan kar diya
 According to Baladhari Yadav, senior member of the Faisalamumtajnagar Ramlila Committee, honoring the faith of the people, 'many women who see Ramlila touch the feet of the actors who play Lord Ram Lakshmana, Sita and other Gods and seek their blessings
 hamane unki dharmikata ko dekhte hue ye faisla liya he
 In view of his reverence, it was decided that now, Muslims who eat meat in Ramlila will be replaced by vegetarian Hindus (even if they are vegetarian only in Navratri)
 haalanki muslim ramlila main chote kirdaar nibhaana jari rakhenge
 Although this decision did not lessen the enthusiasm of the people about Ramlila here, it is still the same as it was in 1963

 In an exclusive interview with Rahul Kanwal on Aaj Tak's Sidhi Baat program, thinker and intellectual KN Govindacharya said that i believe LK Advani should become the Prime Minister
 narendra modior rajnath singh ko kisi naa kisi cabinet ministar ke taur par haath aajmaana chahie
 They should first test themselves, this will be good for the country
 bijepi he mishan or congress he kamishan: modijab rahul kanwal ne sawaal poocha ki is vaktanarendra modidemand main hai to govindacharya kaa jawaab tha ki sawaal demand kaa nahin, desh ke hit kaa he
 What i feel is in the interest of the country is that Advani ji is healthy, experienced, most senior, he has already proved his ability to take everyone along
 narendra modi ko abhi bahut kuch seekhney kii zarurat he
 Has the Congress become synonymous with 'corruption'? But Narendra Modi has been the Chief Minister of Gujarat for the last three times, he has worked, there is talk of his work among the people
 is sawaal par unhone kaha ki mujhe lagata he gujarat puraa desh nahin he, puure desh main vividhtaayen hai, jatiltaayen hai, bahut se antarvirodh bhi hai, un sabhi kaa saamana karnaa, unase nipatna, uske liye vyavhaar main lacheelaapan bhi hona chahie
 He needs a lot of skill, which he has not yet proved
 modimay hua ‘mahamanthan’kya aap maanate hai ki narendra modi lacheele nahin hai, jis tarah unhone bijepi par dabaav banaaya sanjay joshi ko party se hatwaya, ye kahin naa kahin adiyal ravaiya he
 Govindacharya's answer to this question was that i believe that much more flexibility is needed
 apni party ke saath hi aisi jid karenge to anya dalon ke saath chalanaa or kathin ho jayega
 That is why i say that there is a need to mature
 raajnneeti ko kaushal or dhairya ke saath sanbhaalanaa jaruri hota he
 i think an atmosphere of impatience is being created which is neither good for Narendra Modi nor for the country
 PM pad ke liye modi kii daavedaari main kitna dam?jab unase poocha gaya ki is vakt bijepi main sirf narendra modi kii charchaa ho rahi he or chaaron taraf jo bhi log hai wo narendra modi kaa hi naam jap rahe hai
 On this question, Govindacharya said that i do not think so, i think that people who have a dream for the country in the Bharatiya Janata Party will meet below
 netritv ke str par to sirf sajeesh, tikadam, chaalaaki, chapalusee kaa hi alam he
 In such a situation, if someone is silent, then you cannot guess from him that he agrees with the party or not and it is possible that the one who is silent is also plotting
 kya bijepi ke wo netaa jo chup hai wo koi sajeesh kar rahe hai ki mauka milte hi modi ko sidline kar denge
 Responding to this, he said that i say three things, cunning, tricks and intrigue, whichever of the fun will be employed in his work

 At first glance, the title of the book raises the curiosity in the mind of the reader through a question as to what the Mahabharata and Sikandar might be common or what the two might compare
 christopher ne apni kalpanashiltaa or shandaar lekhnee ke dam par sikandar ke samrajya ko faras ke jariye sindh kii jameen se joda he
 After landing on the land of Sindh, Alexander discovers a secret hidden in the Mahabharata, which he can find and make himself as powerful as the gods
 duusari ore yunaan main ek kabr kaa khulaasa hota he, jo pichley do hajaaron saalon se gupt tareeke se chhipi hui thi
 This mysterious tomb contains the body of a queen
 kabr puraani kahaniyon ke jariye sikandar ke vishwa vijay abhiyaan ke bare main kai rahasy or sachchaiyon ko khulaasa karti he
 Along with this, dangerous plans of an unknown enemy are also revealed, about which no one is aware
 kahani kii raftaar or kathanak main utaar chadhaav pathak kii dilchaspee ko banaae rakhte hai
 Charitravijay, Colin, Radha and Imran are four very close teammates
 christopher ne inhen chaar kirdaaron ke jariye puri kahani rachi he
 These four know who to do and how to respond to a given situation, which makes them a perfect team
 lekhak ne chaaron kirdaaron ko sthapit karne ke liye puraa samay liya he, or sabane apni bhoomika ke saath nyaay karne kii koshish kii he
 However, the decision is always up to the reader
 majboot pakshakitab kaa sabase majboot paksh uski gati or style he, jo pathak ko aakhir tak baandhe rakhti he
 Christopher continues his plot by presenting a lot of scientific and historical details
 iske saath hi ve apane pathak ko raay banane or nishkarsh par pahunchane kaa spes bhi dete he
 This is a great feature of the book
 kitaab main sabakuch behad khulaa he, taaki pathak kii ruchi bani rahe
 Thierry Christopher, who has created history, myth and science, has told and explained it in the best way
 kamjor pakaagar aapako pracheen itihaas ke bare main kam jaankaree he, to shaayad aap christopher kii paribhaashaon or daleelon ko pachaa naa paaen or aap padhate hue uktane lage
 As it happened to me kai baar pracheen or aadhunik samay ke bich pendulum ke manind gumti kahani ko pakadana mushkil ho jaataa he
 This creates a lot of confusion and makes it difficult to keep pace with the story
 pracheen itihaas ke bare main jaankariyon ke abhaav ke chalate 'selfi janareshan' ke liye kitaab kii tathyaatmak jaankariyon kaa pakad paanaa mushkil he
 The mystery of the Mahabharata period mentioned in the book leads to a big revelation, but due to lack of information it is difficult to understand
 agar aapaki dilchaspee pracheen itihaas or rahasyon se bhare kathanak main he, to'da mahabharat quest: da elexander sikret'aapke liye he
 Shahrukh Khan's film 'happy New Year' has become super duper hit by earning hundreds of crores
 aise main us film kii prashansa yaa aalochana karnaa bemaani sa lagata he
 Nevertheless, Syed S
 from the eye of an audience
 tauhid ne is film ke jariye kuch mauju sawaal uthaae hai
 Read Syed S
 on Happy New Year
 tauhid ke sawaljindagi va kismat ko kosne kaa nayaa chalan idhar kii filmon main niklaa he
 Charlie alias Shahrukh Khanhar, who categorized the world into just two types of people, has been called the conqueror by juggling
 baazeegar kya kismat ko kosa bhi karte hai? charlie wo aadmi nahin jo kismat ko lekar jokhim uthaae
 The fear of being defeated was giving him all these thoughts? Charlie, who ignored the expansion of world society, has to pay for the injustice done to his father
 jindagi se ek sapana puraa karne vaale kii maang rakhane vaale logon se wo ek team bana letaa he
 Farah Khan's Happy New Year is the story of Intakam of Charchali
 hindi filmon main putr dwaara pita kaa badla lene kii kahani popular formula rahaa he
 Manohar, an honest father who made diamond coffers, was imprisoned by Charan Grover of Jackie Shroff and sent to prison
 eemaandaar manohar ne apane par lage daag ke kaaran aatmahatya kar lee
 Charlie has to take Grover's father's vow
 diamands ko charan kii naak ke neeche se lut le jane kii yojana main team ko shaamil kar wo aisa kar saktaa tha
 Two people who worked with the father were made part of it
 abhi team puri nahin thi teen or logon ko talash kar ise puraa kiya gaya
 Of course Charlie was the captain
 world dance pratiyogita naam kaa reality sho yojana ko anjaam dene kaa vans in e life time avasar tha
 Manzil was also where the reality show was to take place
 team kii mohini ne sadasyon ko dance kii steps bataakar dance sho tak pahunchaa diya
 By gathering the support of the audience, the team reached the stage of the competition
 duniya ke nine nayab diamonds kii hifaazat ke liye unhen charan grover ke paas laayaa ja rahaa tha
 Charlie has to fly the Diamonds with a team of five unsurpassed heroes
 kahani main rashtrawaad tatv laane ke liye ittefaq rachaa gaya ki tijori va dance pratiyogita ek jagah honi he
 Charlie, who has the motive of taking away the most rare diamonds, has a sense of keeping the name of the country too high
 world dance pratiyogita main jeetna ek lakshya tha?team pratiyogita main shaamil hui kyonki grover ko sabak sikhaanaa tha
 The reality show's Maya pulled viewers to theaters
 farah khan kii Happy New Year ko tivi riyality sho kii tarah dekhakar majaa liya ja saktaa he
 Shah Rukh Khan's crazy will not miss it because the film has the king of Hindi cinema
 shahrukh ne kisi saakshaatkaar me kaha tha ki ve garibi se darate hai
 Incidentally, Charlie is also the captain of a team of people who dream of becoming rich
 duniya ko vijeta or parajeet main baant kar wo unka kisi ek taraf hona aasaan kar detaa he
 It was easy to accumulate people who wanted to achieve a lot of luck everyday
 kismat par bharosa nahin karne vaale charlie kii kismat buree nahin thi
 There is not always a fortune between defeat and victory
 shaatir ko nyaay tak pahunchane ke liye usee kii chaal se maat dena jaruri hota he
 Charlie avenges his father in this manner
 badale kii kahani ko rashtrawaad kaa tag lagaakar mahimandit karne main farah safal rahi
 Charlie's team competition has managed to garner support for himself
 box offis par film kii record safalataa se yahi samaj aata he
 Actually, cinema with big names is not considering the film more than business
 bade naamon ke kaandhe utari haalia saadhaaran filmon kii kamai karodon main thi
 People are not appreciating the best films to this level
 cinema ko khaanche main baantnaa thik nahin
 But this continued to happen spontaneously and sponsoredly
 ab kii kamai ke hisaab se beete jamaane ke clasik filmein nirdhan kahi jaani chahie
 The stars of yesteryear would be surprised to see today
 badale hue nazariye main filmein chand ghanton kaa manoranjan he
 The level of entertainment makes a time classic
 kaarobaar se parhez thik nahin lekin kya maha karod club kii filmein clasik kahi jaaengi? bahes bemaani hogi kyonki darshak bhi kamai ko lekar bade jaagruk se hai
 New Definition of Classic? Movies of criminal environments are getting faster here
 salmaan khan se lekar aamir khan phir rithik bhi aparaadh aadhaarit filmein kar rahe
 Both Grover and Charlie are the wrong people to get the floor
 darshakon kii sahanubhuti charlie ke haath isliye hogi kyonki wo pita kaa badla le rahaa
 Doesn't the path matter in the process? Doesn't the way of crime matter? Farah Khan's film proved that everything is fare in love and war
 rashtrawaad se jod dene baad mishan atyadhik rochak ho jaataa he
 Instead of stealing and leaving India, this was the risk of the team coming back to competition to save India
 dance compitishan ke hisaab se farah khan film main jabardast dance seqvence nahin bana saki hai
 Shah Rukh's film could not become great in terms of story, acting and music
 phir bhi happy new year gajab kii safal ho rahi
 You can also get an idea of the popularity found through marketing because it is becoming common to say Happy New Year during the Diwali season

 phir bhi aisa hoga, to isliye kyonki bharat main aaj ek nai satta he jisaki chhatrachhaaya main andharashtrravaad kii nai lahar hiloren maar rahi he—kitna haasyaaspad he ki kisi loktantr ke itihaas main aman-chaiyn kii sabase lambii avadhi ke bich bhi sanyavad kaa ubhaar ho saktaa he! isiilie aaj achaanak saare tathyon ko darkinar karte hue vijay paradeon kii nae sire se jarurat pad gai he
 The funny thing is that despite being older than 1971, both sides have documented this war better
 shaayad isliye, kyonki donon hi pakshon main is jang kaa netritv un afasaron ne kiya jo british parampara main dikshit the jahaan sainya sahitya ko bahut ahmiyat di jaati he
 The narrations of top commanders of Pakistan about this war have been somewhat less mythical than their folklore
 masalan, iske teen pramukh bindu hai
 One, the war was waged by India
 duusare, itani baari fouj or aakraamak kshamta ke baavjood bharat kii haar hui or usne aman kii guhaar lagaai
 The third point is that the 'hindu' armies once again proved that they cannot fight the Muslims
 bhartiya paksh kii maane to isamen koi shaq nahin he ki jang kii shuruyaat pakistan ne kii, bharat kaa kashmir ko bachaane or samay ke saath pakistani paksh ko zyada se zyada nuksaan pahunchane ke alaava or koi uddeshy nahin tha or ek atiranjana jo ki aksar pai jaati he, vah yah he ki pakistan ko america se hasil hathiyaar kitne aadhunik the
 It is largely accepted in India that the war ended in stalemate
 aaj isaki kalpana jeet ke rup main karnaa phijul kii baat hogi
 Three and a half of India's four conclusions about this war are accurate
 aadhe kii riyaayat isliye kyonki hathiyaaron ke maamle main pakistan bhale hamase thodaa aage tha, lekin maamla itnaa bhi bemail nahin tha
 This war was started by Pakistan, which has been sufficiently established by Pakistani writers, including international scholars, in their writings
 is bare main galat nishkarsh kaa aadhaar 1962 main bharat kii haar or 1965 ke aarambh main kuccha main pakistani talaashi par bharat kii sankoch bhari pratikriya he
 In addition, after the incident of Hazratbal in late 1963, seeds of rebellion of Kashmiris were caught due to unrest in the valley
 jang kii shuruyaat oparation jibraltar se hui jiske tahat hajaaron prashikshit ghuspaithiyon ko ghati main dhakel diya gaya or isi ke saath baghawat bhadakaane kii koshish hui
 The Kashmiris did not rebel and the Indian army responded with a raid and attacked the Haji Pir Pass on a rainy night, after the failure of the first operation, the second operation was called Operation Grand Slam
 yah hamalaa jammu sector main chamb ke aasapaas hua jisamen topon kii madad lee gai
 Its objective was to cut off the Kashmir valley from India by occupying Akhnoor
 kuch dinon tak yah kaamyaab rahaa kyonki iklauti bhartiya brigade kamjor pad gai, jaldbaaji main utaari gai vaayu sena bhi naakaam rahi (chaaron puraane vaimpire gum ho gaye) jisase laga ki kashmir to unki jholii main gaya
 At this very moment, India opened two more fronts on Lahore and Sialkot sectors in Punjab
 iskaa koi ranneetik uddeshy nahin tha sivaae iske ki pakistan ko kashmir se uski fujen hataane ko baadhya kar diya jaae taaki vahaan dabaav kam ho
 This was achieved overnight, but the 15th Infantry Division, having crossed the Wagah border to the outskirts of Lahore, did not understand what to do next
 kendriya str par ranneetik soch yaa sthaneey str par yojana kaa abhaav tha
 The 1 Armored Division was on the front in the Sialkot sector
 vahaan ladaai tej thi lekin vahaan bhi kisi ranneetik vichaar kaa abhaav tha
 The best description of the Indian side is written by Marhoom Lieutenant General Harbaksh Singh who was in charge of the Western Command and who led almost the entire war
 unka likhaa byoraa vaaki yathartwaadee bhi he
 He writes in his book War Dispatches (page 214) that "we had patted each other on the back
" 
 
 ek tatasth moolyankan ke deshadrohi qaraar die jane kaa khatra tha
 "they write about their main attacking troop,"
 
 
 lekin jab dhul baithi
 
 
 And the atmosphere of sensation came to an end, then all the euphoria turned into disenchantment
 ''aisa yathartwaadee bayaan pakistani paksh kii ore se hamen dekhne ko zyada nahin miltaa
 He was fully prepared and his objectives were clear and ambitious
 khemkaran main tinkon se kiya gaya baari hamalaa unki ranneeti or ranneetik dhristataa kaa kendriya hissaa tha jo unki pahchaan he
 Its purpose was to overtake the Indian troops in the Lahore sector and cross the Vyas river and who should have reached Delhi
 vaise bhi, shuruaati kamyaabiyon ke baad ayyub khan (pakistan ke tatkaaleen raashtrapati) ne aisa dambh bharaa tha
 His strategy in the Battle of the Real North was broken by the Fourth Division (which was rebuilt after the 1962 defeat) and destroyed the 1st Armored Division of Pakistan
 samoochee jang main pakistan ne do sarvaadhik saahasik kadam uthaae, ek chamb main or doosraa khemkaran main
 In one, he got some success, in the other he was devastated
 zyada ahm chamb kaa morcha tha kyonki pakistan kii uske peeche soch yah thi ki bharat kashmir kii ladaai kisi or seemaa se nahin ladega
 This mistaken belief persisted even later, witness to the Kargil War of 1999
 ladaai ke bare main meri pasandida panktiyaan mujhase atal bihari vaajapeyi ne kahi thim or main pehle bhi ise bataa chukaa hum
 In the winter of 2001-02, after the attack on Parliament, things were becoming like war, then he told me that the problem with war is how, when and where you start it, it is all in your hands
 But when, where and how the war will end, you cannot say
 unhone apane gussaye senadhyakshon se bhi poocha thah ham jang main beshak ja sakate hai, lekin jab itihaas likhaa jayega tab is jang ko kya naam denge, is jang kaa uddeshy ham kya likhenge? kya mahaj yah likhaa jayega ki gusse ke kaaran jang ched di gai?ham jaanate hai ki 1965 kii jang kaa ant kaise or kyon hua thah jab donon paksh thak gaye, ub gaye, donon ke paas sainya vichaaron kii kami padane lagi or hathiyaaron kaa jakhira chukne laga, tab jang khatm hui
 Both sides did not achieve any goal and both got ready for the new war
 1971 ke baad bharat ke paas pakistan ke bainks koi uddeshy nahin bachaa he sivaay nishedh ke, or yahi vajah he ki bharat apni arthvyavastha ko khadaa kar sakaa he, apane samaaj main aman-chaiyn kaayam kar sakaa he or yathasthitivaadee takat ke rup main aaj khadaa najar aata he
 The unfinished military objectives are only in Pakistan's bag and there has been no change since 1965
 vaajapeyi kehete the ki jang kaa koi naam hona chahie
 i call the 1965 war a war of mutual incompetence
 aisi jang kaa jashn manaane yaa uskaa marsia padhgaye kaa kaam hamen unke hisse chhod dena chahie
 We should go ahead of all this, rather we should keep moving forward
 hindu dharm main sadiyon se naagon kii puja karne kii parampara rahi he
 There are many temples of Nagas in India, one of them is that of Nagachandreshwar in Ujjain, which is located in the city of Mahakal in Ujjain
 isaki khaas baat yah he ki yah mandir saal main sirf ek dinanagapanchami(shravan shukla panchami) par hi darshanon ke liye kholaa jaataa he
 It is believed that Nagaraja Takshak himself lives in the temple
 dashamukhi sarp shayya par virajman hai bhole bhandarinagachandreshwar mandir main 11veen shatabdi kii ek adbhut pratimaa he, isamen fan failaae naag ke asana parashiv-parvati baithe hai
 It is said that this statue was brought here from Nepal
 ujjain ke alaava duniya main kahin bhi aisi pratimaa nahin he
 This is the only temple in the world where Lord Bholenath sits on a snake bed in place of Lord Vishnu
 mandir main sthapit pracheen murti main shivaji, ganeshji or maa parvati ke saath dashamukhi sarp shayya par virajit hai
 Bhujang is wrapped in the neck and arms of Shivshambhu
 kya he puranic manyata?sarpraj takshak ne shivashankar ko manaane ke liye ghor tapasya kii thi
 Bholenath was pleased with the penance and gave the boon of immortality to Takshaka Nag, the king of snakes
 manyata he ki uske baad se takshak raja ne prabhu ke saannnidhya main hi vaas karnaa shuru kar diya
 But before residing in the Mahakal forest, he had the intention that there should be no disturbance in his solitude, so over the years the practice is that he is available only on the day of Nagpanchami
 shesh samay unke sammaan main parampara ke anusaar mandir band rahata he
 After visiting this temple, the person is free from any kind of snakebite, so there is a long queue of devotees outside this temple, which opens on the day of Nagpanchami
 do lakh se zyada bhakt karte hai nagdevataa ke darshanayah mandir kaaphi pracheen he
 It is believed that Parmar king Bhoj built this temple around 1050 AD
 iske baad sindhiya gharaane ke maharaj ranoji sindhiya ne 1732 main mahakaal mandir kaa jirnoddhar karavaaya tha
 At that time this temple was also renovated
 sabhi kii yahi manokamana rahati he ki nagaraj par viraaje shivashambhu kii unhen ek jhalak mil jaae
 Over two lakh devotees visit Nagdev on the same day
 nagpanchamiper varsh main ek baar hone vaale bhagawananagachandreshwar ke darshan ke liye ek din pehle hi raat 12 baje mandir ke pat khol die jate hai
 On the second day, at 12 o'clock at Nagpanchami, there is an aarti in the temple again and the temple boards are closed again
 nagachandreshwar mandir kii puja or vyavastha mahanirvaani akhaade ke sanyasiyon dwaara kii jaati he

 One of the toughest missions of this mission was to place Chandrayaan 2 into the lunar orbit, because if the satellite reaches the moon at high speed, it will bounce it and it will be lost in deep space

 The velocity must be exactly right and for the operation the speed must be accurate at altitude rather than at the moon

 loksabhaa chunaav ke nateej bhale hi abhi naa aae hon lekin bijepi ne madhyapradesh main siyaasi bhuuchaal laane ke sanket de die hai
 Leader of Opposition Gopal Bhargava has written a letter to the Governor calling the assembly session and putting the Kamal Nath government in trouble, citing the idea of a floor test
 aise main sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya ab madhyapradesh main bhi horse trading kii siyasat shuru hone vaali he?agsit pole se atiutsahit bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne loksabhaa chunaav ke final nattejey aane se pehle hi madhyapradesh main kamalnath sarkaar ko floor test kaa chalange karne kii taiyaari kar lee he
 Gopal Bhargava has ignited the politics of the new government in Madhya Pradesh by referring to a letter sent to the Governor to call a session of the Legislative Assembly
 gopal bhargav kaa daawa he ki congress alpamat kii sarkaar he
 The BJP has long accused the Congress government of failing
 floor test ke bahaane se bijepi ne ek nae siyaasi gathjod ko tool de diya he
 Actually, since the Congress has been in power 6 months ago, BJP leaders have been claiming to bring down the government
 is list main bijepi adhyaksh amit shah se lekar kailash vijayawargeey jaise netaa bhi shaamil hai
 In such a situation, it was being speculated that after the Lok Sabha elections, if the BJP would raise the issue in Madhya Pradesh, then the Parliamentary Affairs Minister of the Congress Government, Dr
 govind singh bijepi ke floor test ke liye puri tarah taiyaar hai
 Saying that BJP is dreaming of Sheikh Chilli
 baharhaal 15 saal baad congress satta main ai bhi to 230 main se apane 114 or bispi, espi or anya vidhayakon ke samarthan ke jariye jabaki bijepi bhi kuch hi faasale par 109 vidhayakon ke saath he
 Due to this gap, the BJP has been constantly boiling over the change of power for the last 6 months

 In such a situation, we would have only four days left for the box office numbers

 exis-maai india ne upi par jo pehla opinian pole kiya tha, usase BJP ko taj opinian pole main 30 siten zyada mili hai
 2
 samaajawaadee party apane maujuuda avatar main 92 se 97 siton ke anumaan ke saath duusare number par dikh rahi he
 This is despite the party's internal arrogance
 beete teen maheenon main samaajawaadee party kaa graph ooncha hua he jabaki bahujan samaaj party (BSP) duusare se tisare sthaan par khisak gai he
 3
 BSP ko 79 se 85 siten milane kaa anumaan he
 In the last opinion poll, the BSP was seen getting 115 to 124 seats
 BSP kaa utaar is vajah se dikhataa he ki wo apane paaramparik dalit vot bank se hat kar duusare virgon ke matadaataaon ko apane saath jodne main asamarth rahi he
 In 2007, the BSP won with the support of the upper caste Brahmins with the traditional Dalit vote bank
 lekin 2017 main BSP kii gaiyr-daliton main apil simit dikhaai detii he
 4
 rahul gandhi ke hai voltage campan or prashanth kishor kii chunavi ranneeti se congress kii chunavi takadir par koi asar padataa nahin dikh rahaa
 According to opinion poll, the Congress is expected to get 5 to 9 seats
 2012 main hue upi vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko 28 siton par kamyaabi hasil hui thim
 5
 BJP ko 33% vot share milane kaa anumaan he
 In October, opinion polls of axis-my India showed BJP getting only 31% vote share
 7
 Although both SP and BSP seem to get 26% vote share, SP will get more seats
 ye is vajah se he ki SP kaa vot share prabhaav vaale kshetron main kendrit he, vahiin BSP ke vot rajya bhar main faile hue hai
 8
 survey main 76% yani badi sankhya main pratibhaagiyon ne notebandi kaa samarthan kiya
 But people appeared divided on whether the common man has caused inconvenience
 58% ne mana ki unhen notebandi se samasya kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 At the same time 42% said that they were not inconvenienced
 BJP ke vot share main badhotaree hona is baat kaa sanket detaa he ki notebandi se asuvidha ke baavjood log maanate he ki piem modi ke is kadam se desh ko aakhirkaar laabh hoga
 9
 survey ke pratibhaagiyon main aadhe se adhik (51%) ne kaha ki wo maanate hai ki notebandi se kaale dhan or jaali noton ke khatre ko mitaane main madad milegi
 10
 BJP kii SP ke yadav vot bank main send lagane kii koshishen zyada paravaan nahin chadh saki hai
 72% of Yadav participants say they will vote for the undivided SP
 11
 One reason for bsp's graph to fall down is that earlier UP Muslims were seen divided between SP and BSP
 lekin ab muslim matadaata SP kii taraf kendrit hote dikh rahe hai
 In December, 71% of Muslims participating in opinion polls said they would vote for the SP
 oktober main SP ko vot karne ke icchhuk muslim 58% hi the
 In the same period, bsp's support among Muslims dropped from 21% to 14%
 12
 Among all age groups, SP support is the highest among the youth
 ye rajya main yuvaaon main us chhavi kii vajah se jo akhilesh apane liye banane main kaamyaab rahe hai
 13
 BJP kii lokapriyata upi main 60+ matadaataaon main sabase zyada he
 In this age group, BJP has 37% support which is 4% more than the party's overall vote share
 14
 Young Akhilesh Yadav is the first choice to become the next Chief Minister of UP
 33% pratibhaagiyon ne unhen hi pehali pasand bataaya
 Mayawati was ranked second, with 25% being the first choice
 haalanki rajnath singh sanket de chuke hai ki wo mukhyamantri kii daud main nahin hai, lekin ab bhi wo BJP ke liye sabase achche daanv hai
 20% of the participants rated him as the first choice for the next Chief Minister
 15
 As it was also revealed in the previous opinion polls that Mayawati was considered the most capable leader in handling law and order situation in the state 
 taaja opinian pole main bhi 48% pratibhaagiyon ne is maamle main mayawati ko pehali pasand bataaya
 At the same time, 28% described Akhilesh Yadav as the best in dealing with law and order
 ye survey 12 disambar se 24 disambar ke bich kiya gaya he
 This was the time in the midst of demonetisation, when people were facing lot of difficulties for cash
 is survey main uttar pradesh kii 403 vidhansabha siton main 35 siton ko randmali select kiya gaya, jisamen 8480 logon se baatcheet ke sample ke aadhaar par hamane ye opinian pole taiyaar kiya he
 This opinion poll did not take into account the impact of any possible breakdown in the Samajwadi Party
 naa hi SP, Congress or RLD ke gathbandhan kii sambhaavna ke prabhaav ko aanka gaya
 Small differences in multi-angular combat, the unification of 'secular forces' can change all existing equations
 maujuuda sthiti se kya badlaav ho saktaa he, is par exis-maai india ke mukhya surveykshak pradeep gupta ne india today ko bataaya- 'jaise ki abhi muslim vot SP ke peeche kendrit hai
 But if the Samajwadi Party breaks down, Muslims can reconsider their support
 alpsankhyak ek baar phir BSP ke paale main ja sakate hai yaa akhilesh or congress ke gathbandhan kii taraf jhuk sakate hai
 If the Dalit and Muslim votes together, it can prove to be a serious challenge for the BJP
 'notebandi kii vajah se vipareet hawa ke jhonkon se jujhane ke baavjood BJP kaa kahana he ki wo india today ke pole se bhi zyada behatar pradarshan kar sakati he
 The party's general secretary in-charge, Om Mathur, told India Today, "BJP workers have been working at every booth in the state for the last two and a half years
 hamaari koshishen us se bhi behatar nateejein dikhaaengi jo aapane apane pole main dikhaaya he
 Our own calculations say that we will win more than 300 seats
 aap ye mujhase likhit main le sakate hai
 BSP representatives declined to comment on the axis-my India Opinion Poll
 unka kahana tha ki pols hameshaa BSP ke vot share ko kam karke aankate hai
 She is the public who speaks for her party
 pole ke nishkarshon par samaajawaadee party ke pravaktaa gaurav bhaatia ne india today se kaha- 'samaajawaadee party ke maujuuda matbhed baatcheet se sulajhaa liye jaaenge or SP ekajute morche ke taur par chunaav ladegi
 We are very confident that Akhilesh Yadav will lead the SP to victory again by taking forward the issue of development
 rajya main aisa koi nahin jo akhilesh kii pragatisheel chhavi ke aage tik saktaa he

 Airlines business in India is in a big crisis
 sarkaar kii ore se loksabhaa main jari aankadon se yah baat saamne ai he
 According to the list released by the government on the question of BJP MP Rajiv Pratap Rudy, 10 airline companies have incurred huge losses, including public and private
 darasal, bijepi saansad rajeev pratap rudi ne 18 july ko sarkaar se poocha tha ki desh main air india or anya nijee airlines kii vittiya sthiti kya he? desh main vimaan companiyon kii vittiya sthiti ke sudhaar ke liye kya kadam uthaae gaye hai
 Minister of State for Civil Aviation, Hardeep Singh Puri said that the government is serious about solving the challenges faced by the airline industry from time to time
 vimaanan utpaada eendhan (apief) or airline udyog ko punerjeevit karne or udyog kii sthirataa ko sunishchit karne ke uddeshy se sarkaar ke str se kai jaruri praavdhaan kiye gaye hai
 He also replied to another question about reviving the closed Jet Airways
 hardip singh puri ne kaha ki rindaataaon ne sankalp yojana ke jariye jet airways kii mali haalat durust karne ke vikalpon par vichaar shuru kiya he
 Promoters and lenders were expected to arrange funds to save the company from the crisis
 chunki pramotars ne apane share kii puri raashi kaa bhugtan nahin kiya, isliye bhartiya state bank kii adhyakshata vaala karjadaata conceortium raashi uplabdh nahin kara paaya
 Meanwhile, lenders invited bids for changes in the company's management
 phir bhi koi boli hasil nahin hui
 The minister said that now the airline's financial condition can improve only under the Diwali and Insolvency Cord 2016 (IBC)
 sarkaar ne bataaya ki vittiya sansadhano ko jutanaa or uskaa sanchaalan karnaa airline kaa daayitv he
 The Government of India has no role in this
 ye vimaan companiyaan chal rahi ghate mensarkaar ne loksabhaa main bataaya ki rashtriya vaahakon main air india, airliance air ghate main hai
 Talking about private domestic airlines, Go Air, Spice Jet, Indigo, True Jet, Air Deccan, Air Odisha, Star Air, Air Heritage
 nijee vimaan companiyaan 29, 091 million rupee ke ghate main chal raheen hai
 Government and private airlines are at a loss of Rs 70,879 million
