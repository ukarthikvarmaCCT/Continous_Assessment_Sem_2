 a book written by a Union minister claimed that Sonia Gandhi and then Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao's relationship was strained as Sonia was unhappy with the slow progress in the Rajiv Gandhi murder case

 Former Union Minister Natwar Singh has also confirmed that Sonia and Rao's relationship was not normal
 unhone bataaya tha ki may, 1995 main ek raat raav ne unhen phone kar bataaya tha ki unhone (sonia ne) kis tarah unka (raav kaa) apmaan kiya tha
 Thomas, in his book, referencing a speech made by Sonia on Rajiv Gandhi's birthday on August 20, 1995, has said that his (sonia's) words had hurt the entire nation
 kitaab main thomas ne likhaa he, isiilie sonia ne sarkaar par anguli uthaai thi
 She was not close to Rao
 rajeev kii hatya ke maamle kii jaanch main ho rahe atyadhik vilamb se vyathit sonia ne sawaal kiya ki agar purv pradhanmantri kii hatya ke maamle kii jaanch main itnaa adhik samay lag rahaa he, to aam aadmi kaa kya hoga, jo nyaay kii khatir ladata he

 unhone kaha, unka (sonia kaa) drudh vishwaas tha ki shaayad kisi duusari agency ne rajeev kii hatya kii sajeesh rachi or use littey ke jariye anjaam diya
 It was these circumstances that brought Sonia into politics

 According to the former foreign minister, what Rao said was so unexpected that words were not coming out of his mouth

 singh ne raav ko sonia gandhi se milane kaa suzav diya tha
 Then Rao said, how often do i meet him? This is a question of my self-respect
 unke vyavhaar mere swasthya par asar pad rahaa he
 How often will i be insulted? Singh then told Rao that he never talked to Rao about Rao, but he (sonia) feels that the investigation into her husband's murder case is not proceeding at the expected pace
 akhbaar main singh ne likhaa ki raav ne unhen sarkaar ke sabhi kadamon ke bare main bataaya
 It also included making p Chidambaram in charge of investigating the case

 uttar pradesh ke kairana se vidhayak nahid hasan kaa ek video soshal media main viral ho rahaa he
 In the viral video, MLA Naheed Hassan is seen in his constituency appealing to the people of the Muslim community not to take the goods from the shopkeepers of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 saath hi vidhayak kehete hai ki ham saamaan kharidte hai to in bhaajapaayiyon kii dukaan chalati hai or unka ghar chalata he isliye sabhi bhaaiyon se meri apil he ki bijepi samarthit dukaanon se saamaan lenaa band karen
 MLA Nahid Hasan said, 'I appeal to the people that you buy goods from there for 10 days, a month or a few days, but do not buy goods from all the BJP people who are sitting in the market, because you would take the goods from them
 If we walk in their homes, and because of their running, shoes are being played on us today
 ’ kairana vidhayak ne kaha ki aisa karne se in logon kii tabiyat main sudhaar aa jayega
 The video of this controversial statement of the Kairana MLA is becoming increasingly viral
 saath nahid hasan ne logon se kaha ki agar aap bijepi samarthak vyapaariyon or dukandaaron se saamaan lenaa band kar den to unki aarthik sthiti gadabada jaaegi
 The MLA appealed to the public to buy goods for their needs from Panipat in Haryana, but for a few days oppose these pro-bjp traders
 madhya pradesh main congress ne 15 saal baad satta main vaapasi kii he, lekin mahaj 2 maheenon main hi vidhayakon kii mantriyon se naaraazgi ab khulkar saamne aa gai he
 Surprisingly, the resentment is not the BJP but the ruling Congress and independent-bsp mlas
 madhya pradesh main congress kii sarkaar bane abhi 2 maheene hi hue hai
 At the same time, there are about 21 new ministers in the Kamal Nath cabinet who have no experience of ministerial status
 aise main congress or nirdaleey-basapa samet kai vidhayak mantriyon ke kaam karne ke tareeke se naaraaz ho gaye hai
 Most of the Congress and BSP mlas are angry with the ministers' neglect
 vah aarope laga rahe hai ki mantri unhen vaqt nahin dete or unke ilaake main bina vidhayakon se puche adhikariyon ke tabadale kiye ja rahe hai
 The mlas are angry that they are being transferred without their consent and they are not being consulted in their constituencies
 bhopal madhya se congress vidhayak aarif masood ne kaha, vidhayakon ko is baat kaa dard he ki unhen sammaan nahin mil rahaa he
 He said, the minister should talk to the MLA for 5 minutes very well and give priority to the problem of his constituency
 vahiin basapa ke tikat par jeet ke ain rambai pathariya ne kaha ki 'sammaan to kya puch bhi nahin he
 Annoyed at not being made an independent 'shera' minister, not only the ministers were ignored, but the independent legislators are angry that they were promised to make a minister on the backing of a minority Congress government, but now no one is asking
 nirdaleey vidhayak surendra singh shera ne khuleam apni naaraazgi bataate hue kaha ki sarkaar hamen saath lekar nahin chal rahi to sarkaar kaise chalegi
 Government is not giving respect
 dil se pyaar karte hai to badale main bhi pyaar chahie jo nahin mil rahaa he
 This is the life i have spoken to Kamal Nath ji, then i said that you are a first timer, i told him that this policy is from the Congress
 nirdaleey hone par hamane congress ko saport kiya to aap kii policy ham par thodi lagu hogi
 The BJP has taken a dig at the disgruntled BJP ministers over their own party mlas
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki pehle to sabko laalach dekar party main roke rakhaa or ab unhen puch nahin rahe
 Due to which the leaders are dividing into different camps
 bijepi ke pradesh upaadhyaksh rameshwar sharma ne kaha ki jisko jo aashwaasan die hai yaa to aashwaasan puure karo, nahin to har din kaa alag netaa hoga or ham us netaa ke saath honge
 Ministers refused to be ignored; Amidst the resentment of the mlas and the BJP attacks, the ministers of the Kamal Nath government have refused to accept the displeasure of the mlas
 unhone kaha ki vidhayakon kii puri sunwaayee ho rahi he
 Law Minister PC Sharma said that 'chief Ministers and Sub Ministers are meeting mlas
 vahiin grahamantri bala bachchan ne kaha ki koi vidhayak aisa nahin bolta or vidhayakon ne koi club iske liye nahin banaaya he
 All mlas are working, there is a new government and new ministers have been formed, but all work is being done under the leadership of the Chief Minister
 jo kaam 15 saal ke ruke hue the wo ab dhire dhire ho rahe hai
 Let me tell you that the Congress did not get majority in the assembly elections, in this case the Congress formed the government with the support of independents and BSP-SP, but the displeasure of mlas in just two months can cause trouble for the Congress during the Lok Sabha elections

 duusari ore aadhuniktaa main zyada khulepan kaa vichaar nihit tha
 But keeping pace with a worldwide attention-grabbing trend, including South Africa, America, China, Turkey and Brazil, we are seeing a return to the unique notion of a self-reliant community, to a world in which the world a wall is chosen all around to get rid of problems

 Perhaps it is the influence of Bollywood

 However, unlike India with Bollywood old films, gated communities do not seek to have religious diversity

 lekhak da institute of iconomic growth main samajashaastra ke professor hai Congress President Sonia Gandhi is an MP from Rae Bareli
 raibareli jile se teen ahm pad congress ke paas hai
 There is one MLC, one Zilla Panchayat and one MLA
 dilachasp baat ye he ki, ye teenon pad teen bhaaiyon ke paas he or unka congress se vivaad ho gaya he
 a brother Dinesh Pratap Singh, who is an MLC, has been suspended from the party indefinitely by Congress District President VK Shukla
 aise main ab khatra he ki, kahin dinesh ke baaki donon bhai bhi congress ko jhatka na de den
 Let me tell you that Dinesh Singh had a dispute with KL Sharma, in-charge of the parliamentary constituency of Sesonia Gandhi
 haal main upi main sarkaar badalane ke baad jab raibareli ke zila panchayat adhyaksh or dinesh ke bhai avadhesh singh ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav aayaa to bamushkil unki kursi batch pai
 Since then, Dinesh has been continuously accusing KL Sharma of causing harm
 unhone yahaan tak kah diya ki, congress main yaa to wo rahenge yaa phir ke el sharma
 It is worth noting that only after this, the district president of the party suspended Dinesh Singh from the party indefinitely, citing the instructions of the high command
 aakhir congress ko ye bhi ehsaas he ki, agar ab dinesh singh party chodenge yaa duusari party jwine karenge to unki vidhaan parishad kii sadsyta chali jaayegi
 That is why they have not been removed
 saath hi haal main pradesh main congress ke 7 jite vidhayakon main se ek unke bhai rakesh singh or zila panchayat adhyaksh bhai avadhesh par philhal isi ranneeti ke tahat ection nahin liya he
 But this latest incident of Rae Bareli is definitely a shock to Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 vaise ye koun bhul saktaa he ki, pichley kuch saalon se raibareli main ranneetik taur par ke el sharma or siyaasi taur par dinesh singh gandhi parivaar ke do ahm stambh rahen hai
 However, KL Sharma's association with the Gandhi family is decades old, perhaps that is why KL Sharma is given due consideration
 vaise sutron kaa ye bhi maananaa he ki, upi mencongresski buree gat ke baad dinesh singh apane parivaar ke saath nai raah talash rahe the, lekin wo chaahate the ki, congress unako parivaar samet party se nikaal de, jisase un sabaki vidhayaki vagaira barkaraar rahe
 Overall, there are reports of leaders leaving the Congress from all over the country, but this recent dispute in the Congress President's area itself is really going to shock the Congress
 sutron kii maane to ab priyanka ne morcha sambhala he, jisase agar dinesh singh apane parivaar ke saath duuri banaate hai, to bhavishya main party ko nuksaan na ho
 For this, Dabangg Akhilesh Singh daughter Aditi Singh, who was a 5-time MLA from Rae Bareli city, can be promoted
 aditi pehali baar pita kii jagah raibareli se vidhayak baniin hai
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that he is not in favor of imposing further tax burden on the salaried and middle class and said that tax evaders should be brought under the tax net
 jetali ne kaha ki vastav main vah chahenge ki karadaataaon ke jeb main zyada paisa ho, taaki ve zyada kharch kar saken, jisase apratyaksh kar sangrah badhegaa
 Jaitley said, what does it mean to increase the tax base? 
 
 main bhi utana hi apratyaksh kar detaa hum, jitna ki meraa sahaayak detaa he
 The amount of our consumption can vary, that is why everyone is paying indirect taxes
 ’’ Jaitley said, in fact, almost half of your taxes are indirect taxes, you pay excise, customs duty, service tax
 ab jahaan tak iskar kaa sawaal he, isamen kar dayera badhaane ke liye main kar chori karne waalon ko iske daayre main laane kaa samarthan karata hum
 He was asked whether he would increase the tax base (minimum tax limit) to increase revenue in his budget
 farvari main apana pehla purna bajet pesh karne ja rahe jetali ne kaha ki pichley bajet main unhone iskar chhot seemaa 2 lakh rupee se badhaakar 2
 5 lakh rupees and he would have increased this limit further if he had no shortage of funds
 arun jetali ne kaha, '2
 When we talk about the income tax exemption limit of Rs 5 lakh
 
 Today we include all the deductions we have given, 3
 5 se 4 lakh rupee salanaa kamai vaale ko kar nahin dena padataa he
 In that sense, we have reached that position by chance
 ' Jaitley said, "if someone earns 35,000 to 40,000 rupees today and he saves something, then he does not have to pay tax
 lekin jin logon kii kamai is varg main ve kehete hai ki rahan-sahan ke kharche, parivahan laagat, bacchon kii skool fees ke baad ve kuch bachaa hi nahin pate hai
 ' mantri ne kaha ki isiilie vah kar dayera badhaane ke liye vibhinn chhuton ko kam karne ke paksh main nahin he
 He said, 'that is why i wish that if things happened to me and there was more money in my pocket, i would like to increase it
 lekin aaj rajasav kii sthiti chunauteepurn he
 Last time, i made several discounts that were really out of my capacity
 ' Jaitley said, 'but it is right to bring those who are stealing taxes under its purview
 lekin kamjor varg ko kar daayre main laana, vah aaj kii niti nahin ho sakati
 In fact, if you put extra money in their pocket and allow them to spend, then i will get more indirect tax and i will be able to encourage more economic activities
 ' Regarding black money in the country, he said, 'it is in large quantities and it can be easily detected
 kyonki aap real estate main jaayen, jameen kii kharid-farokht dekhen, khanan kshetra main jaayen, aabhushan dekhen, lakjri saamaan dekhen to aap isamen gharelu kaala dhan paaenge
 You go to educational institutions, you will find it there
 isliye isamen kharidaar tathaa paane vaale kaa pataa lagaana behad aasaan he

 phir bhi, pathak yah mahasoos karenge ki upar kahi gai har baat unheen moolbhoot chunautiyon kii ore ishaara karti he jinka ham saamana kar rahe hai
 In particular, today's power widely ignores the values that Gandhi laid and carried forward
 ham apane khadey kiye sankat se duusare sankat ke bich jhulate rahete hai—jaise notebandi, assam main enarasi, kashmir, muslimon ke khilaaf bheed kii hinsa-hataasha or dar kaa maahaul se desh vichlit he
 The Indian Republic stands on the verge of existential crisis
 in asaamaanya rup se bure daur main, prem or nyaay ke apane sandeshon ke madhyam se, gandhi aage kii kathin lekin sahi disha dikhaate hai
 Gandhi's murderer thought he could silence the Mahatma with three bullets, which many in the current incumbent sing
 vah gandhi ke sharir ko mitaane main safal rahaa
 But there are many people in India and around the world who represent Gandhi's values
 ye vichaar or mulya akele gandhi ke nahin rahe, balki un sabhi ke hai jo adhik nyaaypurna or maanviya duniya chaahate hai
 In this era of desolation and despair, we must remember Gandhi's own proclamation: "in the midst of death, life prevails; Truth exists between the untruths; Amidst the darkness, light remains

 He said that America and Israel will not trust us with this
 unhone kaha ki hamane hameshaa philistin kaa samarthan kiya he, jo kashmir ke maamle main hameshaa hamaara virdohi rahaa he
 Palestine has opposed India in the Islamic Organization and other forums
 swami ne kaha ki ye congress kii puraani niti he
 India has made a big mistake by not voting in favor of America and Israel
 kashmir ke mashhoor patrkaar shujaat bukhari kii hatya kii sajeesh aatankwaad ke panaahagaah pakistan main rachi gai thi
 This murder was carried out by the dreaded terrorists of lashkar-e-taiba
 guuruuvaar ko aijeepi kashmir espi paani ne press conference kar isaki jaankaree di
 He has also released a photo of the terrorists who carried out the killing of Shujaat Bukhari, the editor of Rising Kashmir
 aijeepi kashmir ne kaha, 'hamaare paas is baat ke thos saboot hai ki shujaat bukhari kii hatya kii sajeesh pakistan main rachi gai thi
 Terrorists from there carried out this incident
 'paani ne kaha ki shujaat bukhari kii hatya ke aropiyon kii pahchaan sajaad gul, aaazaad ahamed malik, mujafar ahamed bhat or navid jet ke rup main hui he
 Sajjad Gul now lives in Pakistan, while Azad Ahmad Malik hails from Anantnag district and is a Lashkar terrorist
 mujafar ahamed bhat or navid jet bhi lashkar ke aatanki hai
 Earlier on Wednesday, the Jammu and Kashmir Police had asked to identify three terrorists, including the absconding terrorist of lashkar-e-taiba and the Pakistani national Naveed Jat, who were involved in the killing of Shujaat Bukhari
 police adhikariyon ne bataaya tha ki bukhari ko maarane kii sajeesh ke bare main byoraa haal main kulgaam main hui muthbhedon main se ek kii jaanch ke dauraan saamne aayaa
 During this time, the police found evidence that on June 14, minutes before the journalist's murder, CCTV footage showed him jutting between three terrorists on a motorcycle

 Police officials had said that a blogger resident of Srinagar has also been identified, who is now living in Pakistan

 Following this sensational murder, the police released CCTV footage of the attackers, who were riding on motorcycles

 The teacher also threatened to tell the student nothing
 report ke anusaar shuukravaar ko skool kii chuttee hone par shikshak ne chaatr ko bundi sthit apane makaan par le gaya tha
 Upon reaching home in connection with the misconduct the student had with his father, the family went to the school to find the teacher, but he escaped from the school

 If one name is the most discussed in the 2014 Election General Assembly, it is the name of bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi
 party ke meeting room se kaashi kii sadakon tak har jagah 'modi lahar' kii charchaa he
 Actually, Modi's electoral road and the journey from road to power is not that easy, because there are issues ranging from communalism to snoopgate and all the issues on which Modi is being surrounded and targeted
 tasveeron main dekhie narendra modi kaa andaaj
 
 
 Seven rounds of voting have taken place
 lekin kya modi in ulajhanon se paar paaenge? aaropon par vah kya sochate hai? virodhiyon par tanj ke bich vah priyanka wadra ke naam par soft kyon ho jate hai? agar bijepi kii sarkaar banati he to pehle 100 din main modi kya kuch karenge, kya hogi unki nitiyaan or kaisaa hoga unka mantrimandal
 On this and many other questions, Narendra Modi has given an impeccable opinion in his exclusive interview given till date
 chunavi mausam main modi ke is 'sabase solid intervyuu' main modi ne kya kuch kaha, har ek shabd, padhie unheen ke shabdon main
 
 
 Modi: What, a year is only a game of 4-5 months
 dekhie bhai, main majdoor hum, bachapan se mazdooree kii he
 Whatever work i get, i do as a laborer
 dil or dimag se bhi karata hum or party ne kaam diya, to meraa mat rahata he ki usamen koi dheelaapan na ho
 Nothing should be done and God has given me the time, the strength, the ability, i should use it to fulfill that responsibility
 ishwar kii krupa rahi, koi vyavdhaan nahin aayaa
 Not a single program has been canceled so far
 ek din thodaa aviation waalon kii problem ke kaaran helicopter ko roak diya gaya tha 2 ghante
 However, i have arrived on time
 western media ne mere ellection campagne ko lekar jo alag-alag baaten likhi, usamen ek baat ye bhi likhi ki hindustan main raajnneetik dalon kii jansabha 2-2, 4-4 ghante der se chalati he
 But when compared, Modi does not run that late
 aisa unhone likhaa he
 The power may have come from the blessings of the people, even due to the suffering of the country, i would feel like running
 ho saktaa he ki kamitment naam kii cheez bhi hoti he jindagi main, jo aadmi ko daudati he
 Modi said on yoga-pranayam
 
 
 wo meri routine life he
 He is not from today
 bachapan main ham aresas main jate the
 Training took place from there
 baad main jivan bhi us disha main le jane kaa meraa prayaas tha, to mere jivan kaa wo hissaa he
 But these days it is quite disturbed
 in dinon main yoga ke liye itnaa time nahin de paa rahaa hum
 But by the way i can say that 365 days do yoga
 mukademon par modimain nahin maanata hum ki wo stage aayaa he
 Now they have given information
 kanoon apana kaam karegaa
 Our legal team will do its work, but i have always been proud that i have been in public life for so long
 kabhi bhi mere jivan main na kabhi scooter parking kaa cese hua he, na kabhi rong said gaadi chalaane kaa cese hua he
 Now i do not know how it has happened
 vakil log adhyayan karenge
 i do not know the issue outside 150 meters
 gujarat police ne to abhi inquairi abhi-abhi di he
 How they will do, the report they give after the inquiry, they will give it to the Election Commission
 media ko wo dene kaa kaaran nahin banataa he or mujhe to pataa hone kaa bhi kaaran nahin banataa he
 The statement inside the police station, i do not criticize and waste much time in these things
 isliye nahin karata hum ki main pichley 12-14 saal se aisi hi galat chizon ko jhelta aayaa hum
 They will become two, four, ten and more, what will they do? 7 phej ke baad 7 res course se kitne dur?is chunaav kaa main bahut baariki se adhyayan karata hum
 i do camp, but i have been a student of political science
 chunaav jab ghoshit hua, uske baad congress ke varisht netaaon ne maidan chhodana shuru kiya
 The public later came to the ground
 unako lag gaya tha ki bhaago, pehali baar hindustan kii raajnneeti main pre pole elliance 25 partiyon ke saath hua he
 This is the first time he has been with BJP, so this positive flow on one side
 duusari taraf congressi chunaav na ladane waalon, negative pravaah
 In the beginning, there was a hint in the beginning that the Congress is not encouraged to contest elections
 jeetne kaa to sawaal hi nahin, ladane kaa hi mood nahin he, aisa lagata tha
 Well later it is no longer an agenda for them to save the government, cross at least 100 figures, they are working hard in that direction
 lekin lag nahin rahaa he ki congress party dabl disit ko cross kar paaegi
 There are no such chances
 bhartiya janata party kii chunavi ranneeti good gavarnence, dawalpment, suraaj, vikaas- ye mudde logon ke gale utar rahe hai
 People feel that enough is enough, now someone should tell me that i want to do this
 aisa karnaa chahta hum or janata ko us par bharosa hua he or isliye mujhe lagata he ki pichley 20-25 saal main shaayad sabase acchhee, sthir, majboot sarkaar desh kii janata desh ko degi
 Look at yourself being the future PM, the Bharatiya Janata Party has declared Narendra Modi as the prime ministerial candidate and the people of the country have started stamping, but in the words you want, i cannot answer
 i am, because i too should wait till May 16 and will give you a second chance on May 16
 kya he modi kaa road map
 
 
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has a very clear cut road map
 uske saath-saath hamaare paas hamaar trek record bhi he
 Look, in India and i would like to be debated in the country on these subjects, India has seen Congress setup governance, India has seen regional political party setup governance and political activity
 paariwaraki partiyon ko bhi kaam desh ne dekha he
 i have also seen the lieutenant and have also seen the BJP
 aaj hindustan main kisi na kisi rajya main, kisi na kisi kaa model kaam kar rahaa he
 Somewhere he is doing the community, somewhere he is doing the regional parties, somewhere he is doing the Congress, some is doing the lieutenant, somewhere is the BJP
 5 saal main aapane 12,15,20,25 paramiters nikaale hai ki bhai is parameter main ye sarkaar kya karti he, to desh ko dhyaan main aayega ki bijepi ruld state jahaan bhi hai, vahaan par bahut hi focus activity dawalpment hota rahata he
 Now see, Digvijay Singh ji got such an opportunity to rule Madhya Pradesh for such a long time, but he remained a sick state
 shivaraj singh 'chouhan' ne itane kam samay main biimaar rajya ko baahar nikaal diya or ye badi kadi mehnat lagati he
 Chhattisgarh became a new state, in a way influenced by Maoism, the treble belt but today in the smaller states, The Best Financial Discipline, it appears in Chhattisgarh
 yani model agar dekhen, to bhartiya janata party kaa ek trek record he, good gavarnence kaa, dawalpment kaa
 Second, see the NDA time of Atal ji's government
 2002 tak desh main ek mood tha ki chalo yaar desh chal padaa, 21ve sadi ab hamaari ho gai
 This mood was given by Atal ji's government at the time of NDA and hence the track record of the Bharatiya Janata Party is that our vision is very clear
 hamaari nitiyaan spasht hai or hamaari niyat saaf he
 If you see the manifesto of the Bharatiya Janata Party, then you can comfortably say that this government will run like this, with such a clearness and i am thankful to the by large media that they have done a very positive analysis of the manifesto of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 rili varanaa ham logon ko aisa saubhaahgya kahaan miltaa he
 Inflation, bad monsoon what for him? i am surprised, why are you living in such despair, brother
 ye baat sahi he jo 10 saal itane bure dekhe hai to aashaa kii ore jane main der lagati hogi
 Gujarat has been a famine state for 10 years to 7 years
 lekin 2001 se 2014 tak akaal kaa naamo-nishaan nahin he
 So God is so kind to me, God is with me forever and when the people of India do good, then the grace of God rests on the people of India
 main to bhagwaan se prarthana karun or sabhi deshvasi karen ki monsoon acha ho, bura kyon sochen
 On the issue of not suggesting a solution, i give a solution
 agar hamen bhrashtachar se ladanaa he to state policy dryven hona chahie
 Countries should run based on policies
 sarkaar apni policy banaae, jo banani he banaae, usko plus-mines point ho sakate hai, lekin nirnay usee policy ke lite main hona chahie
 Today the country is unfortunate that there is a lot of scope for decriminalization and should not hold it in the hands of the office or the ministry and have a policy in black and white
 log internet par bhi padhakar tay kar sakate hai ki yahaan mujhe entry nahin milegi, yahaan nahin milegi
 Then the man does not go on corruption
 doosraa, ek chota vishay bataaun
 Now see that every young person needs employment, the poor yearn for employment
 wo likhit exam main paas ho jaataa he
 Ritten passes the test
 phir intervyuu kol aata he
 In the interview call, he does not worry about whether he will pass or not in the interview
 usko chintaa ye rahati he ki yaar kaai sifarish dhund lo, koi dalal dhund lo taaki intervyuu main nikal jaaun
 Does this country really ruin millions of rupees of these poor, middle class families through these interviews or not
 karpshan hota he yaa nahin hota he
 We did an experiment in Gujarat
 mujhe 13000 teachers kii bhartee kerani thi
 i told everyone that you fill my form online
 usame apana academy kariyar, duty kariyar kaa or har ek kaa mark diya hamane
 You keep 5 out of 10
 ye he to 10 main se 3 rakhie or aap khud apana bhar dijie
 They filled up
 computer software ne computer ko puch liya ki bataao bhai ye jo aplication ai hogi 40 hajaar, 50 hajaar, lakh, 2 lakh usamen se 1300 top koun ho sakate hai
 The computer fired
 koi human intervyuu nahin
 Directly 1300 people got the call of the job
 anke vidhwaa auraton ko bacchon ko naukari kaa order aa gaya
 There was no corruption
 karpshan roka ja saktaa he
 Another important advantage in preventing corruption between Gujarat and Maharashtra is technology
 technology se karpshan ko bahut had tak roka ja saktaa he
 As i know here, the Indian government finally had to replace the environment minister and people say that the file did not go forward until Jayanti gave the tax and after the minister left, he says that more than 200 File found from signed cupboard
 aisa kehete hai, main sach-jhooth nahin jaanata
 Heard through you aap hi matlab note particular tu person, media ke
 So the Ministry of Environment does not clear the file that they want a green world
 gandhi vaali tasviir chahie
 What we did in Gujarat, whatever file comes for environmental clearance goes directly online
 aap ghar baith kar dekh sakate hai ki aapaki file kahaan travel kar rahi he
 If you have stopped somewhere, then you will know why it is stopped here
 koi bhi aawaaj uthaa saktaa he
 Transparent Through Technology
 mere yahaan gujarat or maharashtra main 2 check post hai
 The train which comes from Gujarat to Maharashtra, while the train also comes to Gujarat at check post
 jitna tex ham lete hai, utana hi tex maharashtra bhi letaa he
 But i have more income of 700 crores rupees, why? Because i have a technology intervention here
 technology se har cheez kaa pataa chalata he
 There may be a centrally monitor
 to mere yahaan karpshan kam hota he
 The second political will is power
 political vil power chahie or agar vil power he to koi problem nahin he
 On the question of foreign bank account
 
 
 main media ke mitron ko kahata hum, agar aapane congress kaa portpholio lekar aapke channel chalaate hai to mujh kahana nahin he
 But you really claim that you are the neutral media, then you also have the responsibility that the Congress has said that look at the truth in which Babu Boghariya is talking, the court has given it
 kya aap court ko nahin maanoge kya? or jis purushottam solanki kii baat karte hai, un par koi cese nahin he
 Now do we have to scream every time we go from house to house in the whole world and will you keep moving around with the guns of Congress, this is your job? Oh, so he said, he said, okay what will he do without any work
 unako to koi rasta he nahin, kam se kam aap, aap apane sawaalon ko lekar mat ghumo
 You still do not schedule an hour about the special subject after this interview
 khojo kya hua, kisne kiya
 Look at when done and how many cases of those ministers who are in jail are going on
 supreme court ko dhundhna padaa ki kaale dhan kii jo suchi mili hui he videshi bank ke acount asal se suchi supreme court ko nahin de rahe the
 And now day after tomorrow, they have given the names of 18 people
 3 saal unhone 3 saal roke rakhaa ki nahin mudda ye he
 You do not care about the Supreme Court, that is, you consider corruption to be a part of your character and because of this the plight of the country
 kaala dhan waapas laaounganhin-nahin, sawaal mudda ramdev or no ramdev kaa he hi nahin
 Lal Krishna Advani made a big trip across the country against black money
 is umr main itnaa parishram kiya
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has been raising its voice against black money since day one
 hamane hamaare chunaav menifesto main kaha he or ham is vishay main kamited hai
 It means to say that even after the Supreme Court has said that those who have not taken action for 3 years do not have the right to point fingers at us
 main kahana hum na bhai, kanoon kanoon kaa kaam karata ha, sarkaar sarkaar kaa kaam karti he
 Robert Vadra is the country's biggest scammer? i have never said that
 mere munh se aise shabd daalane kii jarurat nahin he
 Corruption, small or big, is not my subject
 bhrashtachar paap he, bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai ladani he, bhrashtachar ke saath main kisi vyakti ko nahin jodta hum
 i believe corruption is hollowing out the country
 saidhantik rup se hamen charchaa kerani chahie, kya bhrashtachar desh main chalanaa chahie? kya desh main beimaani chalani chahie? meraa virodh is baat kaa he
 Narendra Modi has repeatedly said
 
 
 auron kii baat chhod do, narendra modi kii charchaa karo
 Whether Narendra Modi has been accused of taking any illegal action, it should be continued or stopped
 meraa kahana he, chaalu rakhana chahie, sari jaanch honi chahie or narendra modi ko wo sari prakriya se guzarana chahie
 i speak Narendra Modi, Narendra Modi cannot be above the law, even if he becomes Prime Minister
 snupaget par modichaliye acha laga
 
 
 You are aware that you are surrounded to trap
 are chhodie, kya inako kya aap nahin jaanate ho
 Of these difficult thoughts
 marataa kya nahi karata
 Vadra's answer Adani? First thing is, you will do one thing
 krantikari kaam 'aaj tak krantikari channel he' karoge
 The entire detailed power point presentation is ready, the request is to show on the channel till date
 baraabar, to aapako in saare sawaalon ke jawaab mil jaaenge
 Secondly, the decisions given by the Gujarat government in respect of lands, the Supreme Court of this country has said that the policy adopted by the Gujarat BJP government in respect of lands, all the states of the country should adopt
 ye anaap-shanaap aarope lagato hai
 Unintentionally or for political reasons
 abhi abhi ek hafte pehle naino ko lekar gujarat hai court ko 100 fisadi positive jajment gujarat sarkaar ke paksh main aayaa he
 But this is not a news for a news trader
 isliye use kaai dikhaata nahin he
 Does not tell
 personal atake par modi
 
 
 i agree that you guys are very simple
 pichley 12 saal se lagaataar mujh par vyaktigat hamale hue hai
 Have happened continuously
 ab ye us charan pe pahunche hai ki ab unako jaraa gaaliyaan dene ke liye shaktiyaan jodani pad rahi hai or takat lagaani pad rahi he, kyonki dictionari main kareeb-kareeb sabhi gaaliyaan khaali ho gai hai
 If they have trouble now, they will have to find a way
 unako itnaa to karne kaa haq banataa he
 Is it made or not
 priyanka par naram kyon?raajnneeti main jo he, jo raajnneetik drushti se hamaare saath spardhaa main he koi parivaar waalon
 
 
 Little
 
 
 ye shobhaa nahin detaa he
 Are abusing my family, it is their will
 lekin main aisa nahin kar saktaa hum
 i can not do that
 pratyaksh raajnneeti main hai, hamen jarurat baat kerani chahie
 not
 
 
 na meraa dilade hua he
 If i still do the speech, take out the speech today, your camera will be there
 good gavarnence, dawalpment, kisaan, noujvaan, yahi mere vishay hai
 This is what i say and vote for the people of the country, if not, 60 years has deteriorated for 5 more years
 lekin desh ko ye phaltu raajnneeti se bachaana hoga
 The country will have to be saved
 Today i have said that while doing corruption, they have identified India with Skam India
 main mehnat karke hindustan kii pahchaan skill india kii banaaungaa
 And if Skill India is identified, then my country will not lag behind China
 aap bacchon jaisi baat karte hai?abhi bhi chup hum
 On DD interview and related controversy? 
 
 phir kya aapke paas us intervyuu kaa vijual he ki nahin he
 What do i need to ask doodh kaa doodh, pani kaa pani
 If you are neutral media
 
 
 aap news reader hai to vivaad aage badhaaie, aap media hai
 
 
 Neutral media
 or aap to khaskar ke krantikari media hai
 So, this is your work which is an interview of Modi
 bas
 
 
 Let the people decide
 
 
 mere jawaab kii jarurat hi nahin padegi
 My party's efforts are the same
 aap dekhie, main aadhe ghante se aapse samay khapa rahaa hum
 
 
 You are not ready to come to the issues
 aap vivaadon par jane ko taiyaar ho, kyon
 
 
 Because your TRP is in it and i am stuck somewhere, you would say that Modi does not have interest on issues
 modi ko isamen interest nahin he
 So why are you killing me for your livelihood brother
 
 
 ?pakistan par modiham kabhi bhi makkhan par lakeer karne ke swabhaav ke nahin he
 We always have the strength to streak across the stone
 upi main polarigeshan?amit shah par jo bhi aarope lage the, ellection kamishan ne maan liya ki wo aarope galat the or ellection kamishan amit shah ke paksh main apana nirnay de diya
 Fear of Modi's name among minorities? First
 
 
 pehle
 
 
 First i want to increase the knowledge of this revolutionary channel
 loktantr main ek vyakti kaa bhi sammaan hona chahie
 Also of a person
 yahi to loktantr he
 The biggest strength of democracy is that a person lying on the far side can hear his voice
 uskaa naam loktantr hota he or isliye loktantr kii vyakhya jo aise aap bhramit mat kiijie
 Every little part is a democracy for him and he is the beauty of democracy, brother
 giriraaj singh paravah court kaa maamla he

 The preparations for the elections to be held this year in Uttar Pradesh had started long before the parties
 lagbhag sabhi dalon ne kaaphi guna-bhaag ke baad pratyaashiyon kii suchi jari bhi kar di
 However, some major parties are busy looking at each other's candidates and then deciding the names of their candidates according to new equations
 upi kii 403 vidhansabha siton ke liye ab tak bispi ke alaava koi bhi anya bada dal apane pratyaashiyon ko final nahin kar paaya he
 Similar is the situation with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 party rajya main 14 saalon se satta se baahar he or party pradhanmantri narendra modi ke sahare is baar satta main pahunchane kii ummid lagaae baithi he
 According to the information, a survey has been conducted on every seat from the party for the winner of the seat
 lekin ab bhi party rajya kii kareeb 150 siton par pratyaashiyon ko antim rup nahin de pai he
 After putting a lot of mind on it for a long time, it has become understood by the party that choosing the right candidate is the most difficult task
 party ke varisht netaa, jo kaaphi samay se uttar pradesh ke maamalon ke dekh rahe hai, ne kaha ki chunaav se pehle hamaare paas kam se kam 150 siton par sahi ummidavaar nahin hai
 Taking established and tested candidates of other parties has appeared as an effective solution
 sutron kaa kahana he ki yahi kaaran he ki duusare dalon se aae kareeb 50 netaaon ko party ne abhi tak jari pratyaashiyon kii suchi main tikat dene kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Out of 403 seats in the state, BJP is contesting 371 seats and candidates of allies of the party will be contesting the remaining seats
 yah alag baat he ki party ke aise faisle se saalon se party se jude or party ke liye kaam kar rahe kaaryakartaaon or anya netaaon main gussa he
 Party sources say that the reason for all this is that the upper caste people have been dominant in the party before
 oonchi jati waalon ko hi pehle zyada tikat die jate rahe hai
 What was left was given to other people
 lekin ab sab badal gaya he
 The BJP also has to add its old vote bank to the people of Barkar and new community, whose number is very high
 bijepi sutron kaa kahana he ki party ko kisi bhi ek samudaay kaa puraa samarthan hai jaise ki samaajawaadee party ko yadavon kaa or mayawati ko dalit samudaay ke ek bade hisse kaa samarthan he
 The BJP has so far resorted to angry people from other parties and its emotional appeal and has taken on powerful alliances like yadav-muslim and dalit-muslim
 2014 ke aam chunaav main bijepi ne rajya kii 80 main se 71 siton par vijay hasil kii thi kyonki gaiyr-yadav anya pichhadaa varg or ati pichhadaa varg ne party ke liye vot kiya tha
 In order to retain the people of these castes in support of the party, the party has fielded leaders from these castes on 40 per cent seats
 party ne 22 pratishat siton par brahman or ucch jatiyon ke pratyaashiyon ko tikat diya he jabaki 18 siton par baniyaa yaa vyapaaree samudaay ke logon ko tikat diya he
 This time the community is a little annoyed with the party because of GST and demonetisation, but it has always been with the party
 tippaniyan Though the BJP wants to return to power in the state by repeating the charisma of 2014, the party leaders are assuming that the assembly elections are completely different
 party sutron kaa kahana he ki 2014 modi lahar thi or kai nae netaa bhi chunaav jeet gaye
 At this time people were also completely angry with the Congress
 in vidhansabha chunaav main hamen loksabhaa chunaav ke mukaable 5 guna pratyaashiyon kii darkaar he, or is samay koi lahar nahin he or yahi vajah he ki party tikat na milane se naaraaz netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ko shant karne kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 It is noteworthy that elections are to be held in seven phases in the state which starts on February 11 and the results of elections will come on March 11
 jaankaree ke anusaar pichley kaaphi samay se party kii ore se har seat par jitau pratyaashee ke liye survey karaayaa gaya
 But still the party has not been able to finalize the candidates in about 150 seats in the state
 lambey samay se is par kaaphi dimag lagane ke baad party ke yah samaj main aa gaya he ki sahi ummidavaar kaa chayan hi sabase mushkil kaam he
 Senior party leaders, who have been looking into the affairs of Uttar Pradesh for a long time, said that before the election, we do not have the right candidates for at least 150 seats
 duusare dalon ke sthapit or parakhe hue pratyaashiyon ko lenaa ek kargar upaay sa dikhaai diya he
 Sources say that this is the reason that the party has announced to give tickets to the list of candidates so far released to about 50 leaders from other parties
 rajya main 403 siton main se bijepi 371 siton par chunaav lard rahi he or baaki siton par party ke sahyogi dalon ke pratyaashee chunavi maidan main honge
 It is a different matter that such a decision of the party has caused anger among activists and other leaders associated with the party and working for the party for years
 party sutron kaa kahana he ki is sabakaa kaaran bhi yah he ki party main pehle oonchi jati waalon kaa bolbalaa rahaa he
 The upper caste people have been given more tickets earlier
 jo batch jaataa tha vah anya logon ko diya jaataa tha
 But now everything has changed
 bijepi ko apane puraane vot bank ko bhi barkarar or nae samudaay ke logon ko bhi jodna he jinaki sankhya kaaphi zyada he
 BJP sources say that the party has full support of any one community like the Samajwadi Party has support of Yadavs and Mayawati has support of a large section of the Dalit community
 bijepi abhi tak anya partiyon se naaraaz logon or apni bhaavnaatmak apil kaa sahaara leti he or isi ke sahare yadav-muslim or dalit-muslim jaise taqatvar gathjod se loha liya he
 In the 2014 general election, BJP won 71 out of 80 seats in the state as non-yadav Other Backward Classes and Extremely Backward Classes voted for the party
 in jatiyon ke logon ko party ke samarthan main banaae rakhane ke liye party ne 40 fisadi siton par inhen jatiyon main se netaaon ko utaara he
 The party has given tickets to Brahmin and upper caste candidates in 22 percent of the seats, while in 18 seats it has given tickets to Banias or people from the merchant community
 is baar yah samudaay jiesti or notebandi kii vajah se party se thodaa naaraaz he, lekin yah hameshaa se party ke saath rahaa he
 The comments rajya main bhale hi bijepi 2014 ke karishme ko doharaate hue satta main vaapasi karnaa chaahati he lekin party ke netaa yah maan rahe hai ki vidhansabha chunaav puri tarah se alag hota he
 Party sources say 2014 was a Modi wave and many new leaders also won the election
 is samay log congress se puri tarah naaraaz bhi the
 In these assembly elections, we need 5 times the candidates for the Lok Sabha elections, and there is no wave at this time and that is why the party is trying to pacify the angry leaders and workers by not getting tickets
 ullekhneey he ki rajya main saat charnon main chunaav hone hai jo 11 farvari se prarambh ho rahe he or 11 march ko chunaavon kaa parinaam aayega

 darasal aajkal dilli sarkaar do hisson main banty hui he
 One is the elected Kejriwal government and the other is the bureaucracy which works directly on the instructions of the Lieutenant Governor
 dilli ke andar up rajyapal hi sarvesarva hai
 Therefore, there has been a lot of tussle between the elected Aam Aadmi Party government and officers for some time
 aap sarkaar ke mantri kehete hai ki afasar unke kehane se kaam nahin karte jabaki janata ke prati hamaari javabdehi hai
 So the other officers say they are working under the rule
 satyendra jain kaa yah aadesh usee vivaad kaa hissaa he
 In fact, nowadays Delhi government is divided into two parts
 ek he chuni hui kejariwal sarkaar or duusari naukarshahi jo sidhe up rajyapal ke nirdesh par kaam karti he
 The lieutenant governor is the only surveyor within Delhi
 isliye beete kuch samay se chuni hui aam aadmi party kii sarkaar or afasaron main khinchataan chal rahi he
 AAP government ministers say that officers do not work as they say, whereas we are accountable to the public
 to duusari or afasar kehete hai ve niyam ke tahat hi kaam kar rahe hai
 This order of Satyendra Jain is part of the same controversy
 uttar pradesh main ab samvidhan nirmaataa baba sahib bhimrao ambedkar kaa naam badla jayega
 With the name of Bhimrao Ambedkar, now the name of his father 'ramji Maloji Sakpal' will also be added
 rajyapal ram nike kii salaah ke baad yogi sarkaar ne ye faisla liya he
 Now his name is' Dr
 bhimrao raamji ambedkar' hoga
 It is being told that Governor Ramnaik had run a campaign in 2017 regarding this
 is dauraan unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bhi khat likhaa tha
 Let me tell you that in Maharashtra also the father's name is added with his name
 is maamle main ab uttar pradesh sarkaar ne aadesh de die hai, jiske baad aadhikarik rup se naam badalakar dow
 Bhimrao Ramji will be Ambedkar
 sarkaar ne records main sabhi jaruri badlaavon ke nirdash bhi de die hai
 Ram Naik had been campaigning for the name change for the past one year
 unhone naam main badlaav ke liye us dastavej kaa bhi hawala diya tha, jisamen bhimrao ambedkar ke hastakshron main 'raamji' naam shaamil tha
 BJP MP Udit Raj has raised objection to this decision
 unhone kaha ki dow
 Unnecessary controversy has been raised due to the writing of Ramji in the middle of Bhimrao Ambedkar's name
 isse dalit bhi naaraaz hai
 Udit Raj says that it seems to have adverse effects and since the morning news has come from many places, whatsapp is also constantly going on why the name has been changed
 kaha jaataa he 'daliton ke maseehaa'!gauratlab he ki desh ke samvidhan ko aakaar dene vaale doctor bhimrao ambedkar kaa janm saal 14 april 1891 ko hua tha

 ye aankade april, 2011 ke liye the
 The number thing is such that, according to which the government is governed, we speak according to it
 aankade sarkaron ke gulam hote hai, ye aapane suna hoga, lekin samajhnaa ho to loksabhaa main kendriya krishi mantri ke bhaashan ko suniye
 They were saying that only three farmers in Maharashtra embraced death in the last three months, ie after unseasonal rains and hail
 sarkaar in teen ko bhi isliye maan rahi he, kyonki kisaan likhakar mare the ki vah kyon khudakushi kar rahe hai? baaki ke jo janvari se lekar march 2015 ke bich 558 kisaan rajya main maare gaye hai, vah sarkaar kii nazar main takneekee galati kar gaye hai
 Before dying, he did not tell why he was going from the world, so our government could not consider him part of the depression spreading in the countryside
 vah nahin maanati ki bemausam barish or ole ne in kisaanon ko marane ke liye majboor kiya
 The Union Agriculture Minister is not wrong that there are only 3 farmers who die
 baaki ke sab to sarkari theory ke shikaar ho gaye
 Today is Akshaya Tritiya
 kisaan pujan kar kharif kii fasal bote hai, lekin akola ke ek gaanv main puure parivaar ne maut ko gale laga liya
 The bodies of five people met the farm
 sarkaar ne kahani banaai kisaan kaa zamin ko lekar vivaad chal rahaa tha
 Pick up any story of the farmers of Vidarbha, Marathwada and see the power of every government story
 sabake pattern lagbhag ek sareekhe hai
 Police will go to the scene soon after the suicide
 aalaa afasaron ko ittala milegi
 First the family will be discovered
 vah mil gai to sarkaar kaa kaam puraa
 The media will be told that the farmer has died due to his deeds
 or agar paariwarik vazah na mili to samajhiye bachaa hua kaam daaru kii kahani puri kar degi
 He used to drink more, was in debt, so the poor guy died
 ab tak mujhe aisa koi aankada nahin mila he, jo bataae ki vidarbha or marathavada ke kisaan desh ke duusare ilaakon kii tulana main zyada pite hai
 The comments tajjub na kariye ki rajya main vahi siem hai, jo maut ke aankadon par ab se kuch maheene pehle cheekhte the
 Used to tell the whole world how injustice has been done to the farmers of Vidarbha and Marathwada
 sinchai ke liye pani nahin mila he isaliye kisaan khudakushi kar rahaa he
 There was a lot of publicity in Vidarbha
 khud narendra modi chaay par charchaa ke liye aae
 One evening in Yavatmal talked with the farmers
 main bhi us din vahaan gaya tha
 Modi ji met the widows of the farmers
 tab se ab tak badla kuch nahin he
 Irrigation plans can no longer be made overnight, so there is no harm in assuming that injustice is going on
 bas shikaayat he to itani-si ki jab log mar rahe hai to ham maan kyon nahin rahe
 Why are government departments trying hard to prove the media wrong? sarkarein thodi-si dayaa dikhaaen, aankade aapke gulam hai, unako hukum den ki wo sach bataaen
 Explain that every farmer who is dying may be the immediate reason for his death but on a large scale the circumstances around him are not allowing him to live
 aaj akshay tritiya he
 Farmers worship and sow the Kharif crop, but the whole family embraced death in a village in Akola
 paanch logon ke shav khet se mili
 The government made up the story
 There was a dispute over the land of the farmer
 vidarbha, marathavada ke kisaanon kii koi bhi kahani uthaa kar dekh lijiye aapako har sarkari kahani main dam nazar aayega
 Everyone's patterns are almost the same
 khudakushi ke turant baad police maukey par jaaegi
 Top officers will get a notice
 sabase pehle paariwarik vazah khoji jaaengi
 If she is found then the work of the government is complete
 media ko bataa diya jayega ki kisaan apane karmon kii vazah se mar gaya he
 And if the family does not get it, then the remaining work will complete the story of Daru
 zyada peetaa tha, karj main tha, isaliye mar gaya bechaara
 Till now i have not found any such data which suggests that farmers of Vidarbha and Marathwada drink more than other areas of the country
 tippaniyan Don't be surprised that there are cms in the state who used to shout at the death toll a few months from now
 puri duniya ko bataate the ki kaise vidarbha or marathavada ke kisaanon ke saath ninsaphi hui he
 No water is available for irrigation, so the farmer is committing suicide
 vidarbha main jamkar prachaar hua
 Narendra Modi himself came to discuss tea
 yavatmal main ek shaam kisaanon ke saath baat kii
 i also went there that day
 modi ji kisaanon kii vidhwaaon se mulaakaat kii thi
 Nothing has changed since then
 sinchai kii yojanaayen ab ratorat to ban nahin sakati, isaliye ye maanane main koi harj nahin ki ninsaphi jari he
 It is just a complaint that when people are dying, why are we not agreeing? sarkari mahakme media ko galat sabit karne main mehnat kyon kar rahe hai ? Governments should show some mercy, figures are your slaves, order them to tell the truth
 bataaen ki har wo kisaan jo mar rahaa he uske marane kii fori vajah kuch or ho sakati he lekin bade paimaane par uske aasapaas ke halaat use jeene nahin de rahe

 The Modi government has devised a unique way to awaken patriotism in iits and Central Universities
 ab in shikshan sansthaanon main deje yaa rock concert nahin, balki students 'deshbhakti mujeec bainds' host karte nazar aaenge
 The Human Resource Ministry has given these instructions to these institutions to complete 70 years of independence and 75 years of Quit India Movement
 21 agast ko 75 sansthaanon ke vaais chancelars or diarectors ko jari hue nirdeshon ke anusaar, 'ye india kaa time he' event ke antargat is concert ko host kiya jayega
 Apart from this, the session of 'new India Manthan' will also be there
 neshnal film develpment korporation ke jariye ministry of information and broadcasting mujeec bainds kii pahchaan kar rahaa he
 a senior official said, 'A private entertainment company has been given the task of choosing music bands
 ab tak darjan bhar se zyada rock bainds se baat chal rahi he
 From next month, these bands will perform in different institutes
 'sarkaar ne jari kiye nirdesh main iaiti or central uniwarsities ko upyukt venue chunakar students ko in bainds ke bare main jaankaree or parformens ke dauraan 'suuteble decorum' bhi mentin karne kaha he
 The opposition raised questions
 
 
 vipaksh ne is event par sawaal uthaae hai
 Chief of AIMIM and MP Asaduddin Owaisi said, 'what is the government's reason behind sending rock band to IIT ? Modi government has not been able to do any good to the people till now
 yah students ko vibhajit karne kii ranneeti he
 IIT is for innovation, not for a band party
 bataa den ki isi maheene sarkaar ne swatantraaa diwas par university or shikshan sansthaanon ko swatantraaa senaanee or shahid smarak le jane ke nirdesh die the
 Public sector banks can provide further concessions to farmers under the debt relief scheme, unless they ask the government to compensate them
 sarkaar kii tran raahat yojana jise ekamusth niptaan otias bhi kaha jaataa he ke tahat bank kisaanon dwaara kul rin kii raashi kaa 75 pratishat tak bhugtan karne par 25 fisad rin maaf kar diya gaya tha
 The scheme is for loans which were to be repaid by 31 December 2007 and which were not repayable till 29 February 2008
 sarkaar nahin karegi antar kii bharpaibhartiya rigerv bank arabiai kii ek taaja adhisuchana main kaha gaya he ki ab sarkaar ne bainkon ko 75 pratishat se kam ke bhugtan par bhi kisaanon ke saath nipataara kar sakate hai basharte ve shesh raashi kii bharpai sarkaar se karne ko na kahen
 RBI said, "the government has approved less than 75 per cent loan recovery under OTS to banks financial institutions, but they will ask neither the government nor the farmers to make up for the difference
" '' kendriya bank ne kaha ki vah bainkon ko is yojana ke tahat 25 fisad rin raashi kaa hi bharpai karegaa
 The government has also made some other changes in the OTS scheme
 1 karod kisaanon ko milegaa labhaisse pehle kisaanon ko yah raashi 3 kishton main adaa karne ko kaha gaya tha
 The first installment submission date was extended from 30 September 2008 to 31 March 2009, but the second and third installment dates were retained on 31 March 2009 and 30 June 2009 respectively
 ab sarkaar ne kaha he ki un kisaanon ko bhi otias yojana kaa laabh milegaa jo 75 pratishat raashi ek baar main is saal 30 june tak adaa kar denge
 According to RBI, the government has asked the banks not to charge any interest from the farmers till June 30
 otias yojana kaa laabh kareeb ek karod kisaanon ko milane kii ummid he
 Yogi Adityanath government of Uttar Pradesh has transferred 41 IAS officers of the state
 upi main bijepi kii sarkaar banane ke baad yogi sarkaar kaa doosraa sabase bada pherbadal he

 iske alaava ashish goyal ko elahabaad kaga kamishnar banaaya gaya he
 Earlier, the Yogi government of Uttar Pradesh had transferred 20 IAS officers in a major reshuffle in the administrative department
 is baar bhi yogi sarkaar ne kai adhikariyon ko badi jimmedaariyaan saunpi, to kai ke par kaate
 Under the first reshuffle, Mrityunjay Kumar Narayan was made the secretary of the chief minister, while Navneet Sehgal was removed from the post of information and tourism secretary and his charge was handed over to Avinash Awasthi

 teen-teen khilaadiyon par macoka lagane ke baad jab dilli police ne poochtacha kaa prem patr rajasthan royles ke maalik raaj kundra ko bheja to unki patni shilpa shetty siddhivinayak pahunch gayi
 But what to do with Pooja's questioning? pulis ne jo poochna tha sab poocha
 Sources reveal that the questions were somewhat like this
 - siddharth trivedi se aapkaa dost kyon miltaa tha, or kya jaankaree letaa tha?- kya aapako pataa tha ki satorion kii team main ghuspaith he?- kiski sifarish par chandila ko team main liya gaya?- team kaa maalik koun he, aapkaa team main kitna hissaa he?- shilpa shetty kaa team main kya role he?- hotel main khilaadiyon ke paas koun-koun ja saktaa he?- aapke 3 khilaadi spot phixing main fanse hai, kya aapako jaankaree thi?- satorion ke bare main isisi yaa bisisiai ne koi sanket die the?- kya aap satorion ko jaanate hai?- srisanth ke bare main koi sandehaaspad jaankaree mili thi?- kya management nen khiladio ko unki fees ke alaava bhi koi penmet kiya?- kya rajasthan royles main koi visilence unit kaam karti he?- ajit chandila ne kya kabhi aapako kisi fiksar yaa buki se milwaaya?- kya aapako koi match ke bare main jaankaree maangata tha, match se pehle yaa baad main?- oficial party ke alaava, privet party ke bare main aapako jaankaree thi?bataaya jaataa he ki kundra ke javaabon se police santusht nahin hui
 On the other hand, Umesh Goenka, a friend of Raj Kundra, who was mentioned by Siddharth Trivedi, has now agreed to become a government witness in the fixing case
 dilli police ne spot phixing ke puure cese par hi macoka laga diya
 The Delhi Police claims that they have complete evidence that the fixing wires are directly connected to Dawood Ibrahim and his closest chhota Shakeel
 isi vajah se duusare aropiyon ke saath hi srisanth ko bhi 18 june tak ke liye nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya gaya
 For Raj Kundra and Shilpa Shetty, now they have to deal with the questions that they have been shy about
 saath main anuj mishra or nitin jain Baba Ramdev reached Delhi fiercely targeted the government
 ramlila maidan main police karrwai main ghayal rajbala se jibi pant aspataal main mulaakaat karne ke baad baba ramdev ne ek press conference main sarkaar ko jamkar khari-khoti sunai
 Ramdev said that the government has become not only corrupt but also tyrannical
 ramdev ne kaha ki bhrashtachar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane vaale logon ko sataaya ja saktaa he, unhen mitaayaa nahin ja saktaa he
 He said that if raising the issue of corruption is a crime, then we will commit the crime a million times
 ramdev ne yah bhi kaha ki jo koi bhi vyakti, sanstha yaa party bhrashtachar ke khilaaf he, vah uskaa samarthan karenge
 Ramdev described the police action at Ramlila Maidan as barbaric and said that the police wanted to kill him
 ramdev ne aarope lagaaya ki unki mahila samarthakon ke saath balaatkaar tak kii koshish kii gai
 Ramdev said that if he was wrong, then why did the Prime Minister write a letter to him and why the great ministers of the Center kept meeting him
 ramdev ne kaha ki vah kisi party kaa mukhauta nahin he
 For him, the issue of black money and corruption is of paramount importance and he will always raise his voice for this
 bharat main sabase zyada pasand kii gai saarvajanik shakhsiyaton main ek kii jindagi kaa akalan karne ke is tareeke ko laaparvaah qaraar diya ja saktaa he lekin aaie, sabase pehle un baton par ek najar daalen jinase divangat purv raashtrapatiapije abdul kalamka koi vaasta nahin tha
 In the traditional sense, he was not really a scientist, because he did not have enough published papers
 ve desh ke parmaanu bam ke janak bhi nahin the kyonki use to parmaanu urja vibhaag ke vaigyanikon kii do peedi ne milakar viksit kiya tha
 He also had no special speech art and often kept repeating his own citations
 apane purvavarti raashtrapatiyon kii tarah na to ve koi vidwaan the or na hi koi khaas lekhak the
 He did not get married, so he was not a family type child and had no children
 na hi ve apane prashikshan yaa prishthbhumi se koi netaa yaa saarvajanik vyaktitv the, unki jindagi kaa adhikansh hissaa hathiyaar nirmaan kii rahasyamay duniya ke bich gujara tha
 He loved reciting Sanskrit shlokas and playing Rudra Veena and was an ordinary believer Muslim
 ab sochie ki ve kahaan se kahaan pahunch gaye
 He joined the ranks of our all-time great scientists like CV Raman and Jagdish Chandra Bose and also came forward from Homi Bhabha or Vikram Sarabhai and colleagues of DAE, ISRO and DRDO coming from the generation of their predecessors
 ve hamaari smritiyon main ek aise shaks ke bataur bas chuke hai jisane hamen parmaanu nishedh kii kshamta uplabdh karai
 He has become our most popular speaker among the last few generations, geographies and populations, and it has never happened that people were not standing in a packed hall with his speeches
 unhone jo kitaaben likhin, masalan india 2020, ve adhiktar dharmopadeshon kii shrenee main aa sakati hai, phir bhi ve hamaare itihaas main sarvaadhik bikne vaali cathetar pustaken sabit huin or lambey samay tak unhen yah darja praapt rahegaa
 If our children gave love to any leader after uncle Nehru, then he was Kalam
 unka kad itane naatakeey dhang se badhata gaya ki ve hamaare sabase rajnatik raashtrapati sabit hue jabaki yah prakriya behad vivekpurna or nishpaksh rahi
 All the communities wanted him, trusted him, but he emerged as a Muslim who was loved most by the majority Hindu people of India in our entire history
 iskaa sirf ek apwaad badshaah akbar ho sakate hai jinke bare main behad udaaravaadi itihaaskaaron kii aisi hi raay he
 And finally, in spite of my thick skin, the one fact that i have been afraid to count myself for what they were not is that they did not have a phd
 unki doctoret kii sari oopaadhiyaan maanad thim, phir bhi unke naam ke aage 'doctor' kitna fabtaa tha or unke katutam aalochak bhi—jinamein adhiktar parmaanu shastron se jude satta pratishthan ke bheetar maujuud hai—ise saarvajanik taur par kehane se bachate the
 The question arises what was within him that spared him so much love and respect
 unke paas jo naitik takat thi, vah shaayad hi kuch ke paas aazaadee ke baad se rahi hogi
 First, it came from his humility
 aapane kabhi nahin suna hoga ki unhone isro-diardio kii uplabdhiyon ke liye kabhi bhi koi shrey liya ho, kabhi koi garvokti kii ho, kisi ke khilaaf kuch kaha ho yaa koi shikaayat kii ho
 Yes, as a man working in a scientific-engineering establishment hidden behind a thick wall of bureaucracy throughout his life, there were undoubtedly some complaints on his account as well
 phir bhi ve kabhi bhi inhen saamne lekar nahin aae, na hi in shikayaton ko naakaamiyon kaa bahaanaa banaaya
 i wrote two articles of the same title in his criticism in April 2001, in which the earlier title was "kalams Banana Republic
 '' uske baad ek shaam dilli ke sirifort parisar main daudte hue main lagbhag unase takaraa hi gaya tha, jahaan ve tahala karte the
 They then lived at drdo's guesthouse in Khelgaon
 unhone pakad liya ki main unase nazren chura rahaa tha
 He stopped smiling and said that he wanted to tell how much he enjoyed reading that article and how he completely agreed with it
 main unke chehre par us vakt vyangy ke bhav khoj rahaa tha jab unhone kaha, ''mujhe ummid he ki adhikari bhi ise padhate honge
 DRDO has very serious challenges and drawbacks
 hamen kuch karnaa hoga
 "anyone who has known Kalam for a long time knows that he used to speak clearly
 raashtrapati ke bataur unka namakan vaajapeyi-adwani kaa masterstroke tha
 He was the first bjp-led government in the country and he was aware that this government needed to be inclusive
 jaahir he, koi bhi aisa musalmaan jo rashtriya nayak bhi ho, unke liye thati sabit hota, lekin kalam ne is jimmedaari ko samay ke saath jaise sambhala, usne unhen bhi chaunkaaya hoga
 His presence during the standoff with Pakistan (operation Parakram) was very reassuring when we stood at the brink of war for at least a year
 iske alaava, gujarat ke dangon ke baad desh ko jaise aashwastakaari sparsh kii jarurat thi, vah bhi unhone hi diya
 He intervened in the matter with considerable maturity and did not allow himself to be favored at all, yet he managed to convey the message of what he was thinking
 unka yah hastkshep itnaa prabhavakaari tha or itane sookshm tareeke se kiya gaya tha ki unke prati hinduon kaa sammaan aane vaale samay main or badhata hi gaya
 Kalam's legacy, however, is more grand than it
 yah viraasat kitni bhavy thi, use purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke india today samooh ke liye karan thapar ko die saakshaatkaar se samajha ja saktaa he
 He reminded us that without Kalam's intervention there could not be a nuclear deal with the US
 sansad kaa monsoon satr 2008 main jaise hi prarambh hua or prakaash karaat ne elaan kiya ki ve upie se apana samarthan waapas le rahe hai tathaa parmaanu saude ke mudde par sarkaar ko giraane ke liye bijepi ke saath milakar vot denge, achaanak manmohan singh ke saamne aankadon kii samasya khadi ho gai
 Manmohan Singh's government not only survived but with the support of Mulayam Singh Yadav, he also won his most risky political battle
 apane vishaal muslim vot bank ke chalate mulaayam singh shuruyaat main parmaanu saude ke khilaaf the
 Congress approached Mulayam and considered the possibility of backdoor transactions
 mulaayam ko bas ek aashwaasan kii jarurat thi
 Kalam worked in this as he moved his hands firmly in favor of the deal
 iske baad se to mulaayam singh or amar singh sirf tote kii tarah ratate najar aae ki agar dow
 If Kalam is saying then it will be fine
 aap us vishwaas mat par sansadeey bahason ko dekhen to paaenge ki kaise asaduddin ovaisi ne apni raajnneeti ko sir ke bal khadaa karte hue kitni shiddat se parmaanu saude kaa bachaav kiya tha
 Kalam was also behind this
 aashcharya he ki aaj bhi is hastkshep ko kam hi yaad kiya jaataa he or kalam par likhe gaye asankhya smritilekhon main bhi iskaa ahmiyat ke saath zikr nahin kiya gaya he
 The fact is that by then not only the 'secular' parties but also the nuclear-scientific establishment had enough doubt that the deal would be able to handle military and civilian use reactors separately
 kalam ne in ashankaon ko dur karne kaa kaam kiya or sirf isliye, kyonki unke liye sabase pehle yah raashtra tha
 Just a year ago, the Congress had embarrassed him by refusing to give him a second term and he agreed to it after everyone agreed
 congress ne ise vito kiya tha
 For Kalam, this opportunity was ideal that he would be able to repair his relations with the UPA and at the same time repay the favor of the BJP which gave him the Bharat Ratna and the President's post
 isse pataa chalata he ki kuch or chijen thim jo kalam main nahin thim
 For example, he was not a child, not a pessimist
 ve swaarthee, badale kii bhaavana vaale, siddhanthavihin or ahamkaari bhi nahin the
 This is the reason why the population of more than one billion will remember him as his most favorite leader during the past decades
 punashchah kalam ke bare main meraa sabase pasandida adhyay bahut shuruaati he
 In 1994, ISRO encountered a case of espionage
 yah kaha gaya tha—or is par vyapak sahmati bhi thi—ki isro ke do aalaa vaigyanikon ko pakistani khufia agency ne maldive kii do mahilaon kaa istemaal kar ke fans liya he or un donon ne pakistan ko rocket se judi ranneetik gopneey baaten bataa di hai
 While working on this news for India Today, i found that the whole story is dubious and fanciful
 patrika ne jo story prakashit kii, usne kerala police or guptchar beuro ke sanskaran ko puri tarah dhwast kar daalaa or vaigyanikon ko puure sammaan ke saath chhod diya gaya
 Eventually, the cases were withdrawn from him and the Supreme Court ordered him cash compensation
 shuruyaat main haalanki chautarafa fail chuki is kahani ke khilaaf janaa kaaphi tanaav paidaa karne vaala tha or un dinon to internet nahin tha, phir bhi hamen bahut gaaliyaan sunani padi thim
 After this incident, Kalam, the then head of DRDO, called me to talk on Army Day reception on 15 January
 unhone dhire se meri chaati par bain ore koncha or kaha ki tumne jo kiya he, vah hamaare dil ke jakhmon par maraham lagane jaisaa kaam he
 i asked him what the hell was
 unhone kaha ki ve vaigyanik puri tarah nirdosh hai or achche log hai
 They said that this false case could ruin my ISRO (where they used to work earlier)

 lekin is par nigahen puure desh kii lagi hai

 kejariwal or bedi aamane-saamne hai
 But because what will happen if BJP loses
 aaie isi kalpana ko aage badhaate hai or samajhane kii koshish karte hai ki bijepi kii haar ke myne kiske liye kya honge-modi-2001 main unhen gujarat main satta saunpi gai thi, ve tabase aparaajey hai
 For all kinds of opponents
 party ke bheetar bhi or baahar bhi
 They have been doing this feat by turning every situation in their favor
 gujarat main hetric ke baad sidhe pradhanmantri pad tak
 Successful journey
 berokatoke
 If BJP loses, the biggest difference will be on Modi's body language
 puure desh par jeet kaa paracham lahraane vaale modi ko paanch saal tak yah chubhta rahegaa ki jis lutiuns main ve rahete hai, vahaan shashan kejariwal kaa he
 They claim to have rejected the opposing parties outright, but will no longer be able to do so
 bijepi bhale hi isse kinaaraa kare, lekin haar modi kii hi maani jaaegi
 Because he asked for votes for Bedi in his own name
 amit shah-loksabhaa main jeet ke baad se shah bijepi hi nahin baaki dalon main bhi chunavi raajnneeti ke chanakya ke rup main sweekaar kiye gaye
 Every strategy he created was successful

 lekin, yadi dilli main bijepi harati he to sabase badi kirakiri amit shah kii hi hone vaali he
 The election time was fixed at his behest, he took all decisions on behalf of Delhi BJP

 bjp's body is also getting stronger
 lekin dilli kii haar bijepi ke us majboot sharir ke dil main chhed jaisi hogi
 The faction in the Sangh and BJP that has been feeling dissatisfied with Modi's work will be outspoken
 kejariwal-salbhar ke bheetar unhone har oonch-neech dekh lee he
 He can now be called a respected leader in the game of politics
 2013 ke ant main dilli vidhansabha chunaav main abhootpurv jeet
 Then resign
 uske baad loksabhaa chunaav main party kii deshbhar main kirakiri
 Kejriwal's massive defeat against Benares
 or ab phir dilli ke takht par
 By defeating Modi and BJP running in form
 modi kii paheli ko crack karne vaale pehle netaa
 The Aam Aadmi Party, filled with many contradictory leaders, will strengthen its voice
 ab unke liye chunauti hogi khud phir se rashtriya raajnneeti par ubhaarne kii
 The national politics-anti-modi camp was only waiting for this
 modi or bijepi kii is asafalataa se sirf congress hi nahin, har party ko nai urja milegi
 Modi and BJP will be made fun of
 modi or unki team ko dabaav main laane kii koshish kii jaaegi
 This will be the chance that Lalu, Mulayam will try to burn his life once again in the Third Front
 isi saal bihar main chunaav hone hai
 Investor - Recently, news came that the ceos of hundred big companies have joined BJP
 kaarobaar jagat agle paanch saal hi nahin balki das saal ke liye modi ko hi pradhanmantri pad par dekh rahaa he
 But the stock market is also a barometer of political conditions
 shuukravaar ko jis tarah se sensex ne ghota lagaaya, vishleshkon ne use dilli chunaav se jodakar dekha
 As if Modi's trust is broken
 ye bahut jaldbaaji he, lekin is chunaav main yadi bijepi kii haar hoti he to modi ko niveshkon ko phir se confidence main lene kii jarurat hogi

 'what are External Directors' means that according to the Reserve Bank's system, there is a full-time governor and a maximum of four deputy governors
 iske alaava, sarkaar dwaara namit ek darjan se zyada gaiyr sarkari nideshak hote hai, jinhen bahari nideshak bhi kehete hai
 What the Governor gave Answer: The Governor explained how the Reserve Bank's information sharing system and data gathering system worked
 kai baar aankade aparyaapt yaa herapheri kiye hue hote hai
 The source, who was involved in the proceedings, said, "the questions may not have been fully justified, but it was clear that RBI officials were feeling uneasy with this
 'rigerv bank board kii meeting main yas bank ke masale ko bhi uthaaya gaya
 External directors have raised this issue at a time when the Reserve Bank is facing a lot of criticism for its investigation and monitoring system
 gauratlab he ki pienbi or piemasi bank ke maamle main kai adhikariyon ne system kii khami kaa phayda uthaakar rigerv bank ko andhere main rakhaa
 In the case of PNB, the bank's loan to Nirav Modi was saved from the monitoring system of the bank itself and the Reserve Bank because the bank's SWIFT system was not linked to the bank's core banking system (CBS)
 bank ke kai adhikariyon ne SWIFT network main chhedchhad kar avaidh tareeke se letters of andertekings jari kiye, jinke dwaara videsh main neerav-mehul kii companiyon ko karj mila

 aamtaur par sitaron ko bura lagata he jab media unka peechha karata he, magar alia ko bura nahin lagata
 She says that if the media does not take a photo of her, her heart will hurt
 kai baar jab vah apane dost siddharth ke ghar ke aasapaas dikhti hai to aksar photographer unke peeche hote hai or photo khinchate hai, magar unhen is baat kaa bura nahin lagata, kyonki kai baar vah kah chuki hai ki media kii bheed, glamer, staradam, ye sab unhen bahut pasand he or isi ke bich vah jinda rahanaa chaahati hai
 The comments yahi vajah he ki alia ne media ko bataaya ki mujhe media se bura nahin lagata
 Alia would have no objection if the media went around and took a picture of her
 bas media ko ye khyaal rakhana he ki unke ghar kii diwaar ke baahar tak rahanaa he
 Aaliya also says that "actually i like when the media follows me
 agar main unase kuch kah duun or ve meri tasviir kheenchna band kar denge to main unase khud kahuungi kii meri photo khincho plis
 This is the reason why Alia told the media that i do not mind the media
 aalia ko koi aitraaj nahin agar media unke peeche-peeche ghume or unka photo khinche
 Just the media has to take care that they stay outside the walls of their house
 aalia ye bhi kahati hai ki "asal main mujhe acha lagata he jab media meraa peechha karti he
 If i tell them something and they will stop taking pictures of me, then i will ask them to take my photo please
 aalia ye bhi kahati hai ki "asal main mujhe acha lagata he jab media meraa peechha karti he
 If i tell them something and they will stop taking pictures of me, then i will ask them to take my photo please

 The Indian Foreign Secretary's visit to Islamabad next week will not solve any motive
 ' Syed Akbaruddin, a spokesman in the Ministry of External Affairs, said, "the Indian Foreign Secretary had told the Pakistan High Commissioner (abdul Basit) in a clear and uninteresting manner that Pakistan's continued efforts to interfere in India's internal affairs are unacceptable
" ' unhone kaha, 'is baat ko rekhaankit kiya gaya tha ki pakistani ucchayog kii hurriyat ke in tathakthith netaaon ke saath mulaakaat pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara may main satta sanbhaalane ke thik pehle din shuru kiye gaye sarthak kootnithik prayaason ko kamjor karegi

 He said that the only way before Pakistan is to resolve the pending issues through peaceful bilateral talks within the scope of the Simla Agreement and the Lahore Declaration and in accordance with its principles
 pravaktaa ne kaha, 'isiilie maujuuda halaat main yah sochaa gaya ki agle saptaah bhartiya videsh sachiv ke islamabad jane se koi makasad hal nahin hoga

 The atmosphere of the two-two Dharmasandas in Kumbhanagri Prayagraj for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya is heated
 to vahiin rashtriya rajdhani dilli main desh ke vishvavidhyalayon main shikshakon kii niyukti ke liye 13 point roster lagu karne ke khilaaf vishaal march kaa aayojan ho rahaa he
 Although these two events are different from each other, these incidents once again refresh the concept of Mandal vs Kamandal, which set up the conflict of two streams in the politics of the country
 tejasvi kaa sansad tak paidal marthdesh ke vishvavidhyalayon main shikshakon kii niyukti ke liye anusuchit jati, anusuchit janajati, anya pichhadaa varg ko aarakshan dene ke liye 13 point roster kaa niyam lagu karne ke khilaaf rashtriya janata dal ke netaa or bihar ke netaa pratipaksh tejasvi yadav ne mandi house se sansad tak march kaa aahvaan kiya he
 In this regard, Tejashwi has written an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that to eliminate reservation, the rule of 13 point roster is being implemented in specialty universities so that socially backward classes do not get the benefit of reservation
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 There is a further battle ahead, when the Constitution Amendment Bill was passed by the central government to provide 10 percent reservation to the poor of the general class, the RJD had openly opposed this bill
 argedy ne ise aarakshan khatm karne kii sajeesh main pehla kadam bataaya tha
 RJD leader and MP Manoj Jha told 'aaj Tak' that 13 point roster is the immediate cause of this movement
 lekin badi ladaai saamaajik rup se shoshit varg ko aabaadi ke lihaaj ke pratinidhitiv dilaane kii he
 Our and other Bahujan leaders have said a hundred times that reservation is not a bailout but a means of ensuring the representation of dalit-bahujan society
 unhone kaha ki essi / asti act ko kund karne vaale supreme court ke faisle par sarkaar 2 april, 2018 ke andolan tak soti rahi
 Ram temple issue heats up, all this is happening when the country stands at the mouth of Lok Sabha elections
 ek taraf centre sarkaar ne chunaav se pehle ram mandir nirmaan maamle main bada kadam uthaate hue supreme court se gaiyr-vivaadit jameen waapas karne kii guhaar lagaakar apana daanv khel diya he
 So at the same time, the date for the construction of the temple has been announced in Dharmasand in Prayagraj
 iske alaava viechpi kii aguwai main guuruuvaar se do divasiy dharmasansad hone ja rahi he
 So it can be said that there is enough logistics in Kubhanagari to raise the Ram temple issue before the elections
 mandal banaam kamandal kii shuruyatyah donon ghatnakram 90 ke dashak kii yaad dilaate hai jab rashtriya morcha sarkaar kii aguwai karne vaale purv pradhanmantri veepi singh ne mandal kamishan kii sifarish lagu karne kaa nirnay liya tha
 During that time VP Singh's government stood on the crutches of BJP and Left parties
 unke is faisle ne bijepi ko sakate main daal diya
 Realizing the complexity of castes, the BJP did not react immediately
 lekin mandal kamishan kii sifarish ke doorgaami raajnneetik parinaam kii kaat ke liye bijepi ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ne hindu ekajutata kaa naaraa dete hue ram mandir andolan tej kar diya
 Later the confrontation of these two streams of politics was called Mandal vs Kamandal
 jisamen ek taraf hinduvaadi sanghathan the, to duusari taraf gandhi-ambedkar-lohia ke siddhant ko maanane vaale sanghathan
 Advani's rath yatra from Somnath reached Bihar when Lalu Yadav's government arrested him
 janata dal ke netaa lalu yadav kii is karrwai ke chalate bijepi ne veepi singh kii sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya
 After which VP Singh said that he sacrificed his throne against communalism in the fight for social justice
 kya mandal banaam kamandal hoga loksabhaa 2019?ab loksabhaa chunaav main jab kuch hi maheene bache hai to ek baar phir ram mandir mudda garma rahaa he
 The central government's move has also given a boost to the BJP, with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Vishwa Hindu Parishad activists excited
 isliye is chunaav main ram mandir kaa mudda jor pakadega isamen koi do raay nahin
 At the same time, mobilization is being tried once again in the name of social justice by making reservation to the general class, issue 13 point roster
 aane vaale samay main is donon dhaaraon main takaraav kii puri gunjaaish he
 So, before the Lok Sabha elections, once again the background of Mandal vs Kamandal seems to be set

 Although the Mahagathbandhan government was in power for 20 months in Bihar, the relationship between its two constituents Janata Dal United and RJD top leaders Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav has never been comfortable
 yah baat kisi se nahin chhipi ki donon ke rishte sahaj nahin rahe
 On Monday, Nitish Kumar said in a conversation with journalists that even Lalu Yadav did not falter due to his attempt to break the mlas
 nitish ne kaha ki sambandh tuutane ke 15 din pehle se lalu unki party ke vidhayakon ko pralobhan dene se baj nahin aa rahe the
 Read: Janata family has broken 11 times in 29 years, will Sharad Yadav disband for the 12th time? nitish ne kaha ki us samay apni party ko mahagathbandhan ke liye dubo dete kya? haalanki rajd ne is aarope par koi pratikriya nahin di he, lekin patna ke raajnneetik galiyare main is baat kii charchaa bahut garam thi
 RJD politicians themselves were convinced that Lalu Yadav would divide Janata Dal United with his influence
 rajd ke netaa maanate hai ki nitish ne satta parivartan ke khel ko jis chaturaai se anjaam diya uske baad nakhun chabane ke alaava koi vikalp nahin bachaa tha
 The comments padhein: srijan ghotaale kii aanch rabari devi ke kaarykaal tak pahunchi, nitish kumaar hue hamalavar iske pehle bhi apni party ke kaarykram main nitish kumaar ne pehali baar kaha ki lalu yadav or tejasvi jaise saarvajanik manch se yah elaan karte the ki mukhyamantri unhone banaaya yaa vahi mukhyamantri bane rahenge unke liye kaaphi apmanjanak tha
 Although the RJD leader also believes that Nitish had expressed his displeasure to the people close to Lalu Yadav several times, Lalu Yadav probably did not assess that Nitish would form the government with the BJP in a few hours
 nitish ne rajd ke purv saansad mo
 Shahabuddin's statement that Nitish is the leader of the situation but Lalu was also very angry at Yadav's silence, but recently Lalu Yadav said in a meeting at Siwan Yatra that Shahabuddin had rightly said

 khud rajd ke raajnneetijna is baat ko lekar aashwast the ki lalu yadav apane prabhaav se janata dal united ko vibhajit kar denge

 Beat by 0 dilli main teenon emsidi ko ek karne kii bijepi kii maang par aam aadmi party ne aapatti jataai he
 Aaj Tak had a special conversation with 'AAP' spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj on the entire issue of Delhi government
 saurabh ke mutabik bijepi pichley 15 saal main emsidi se bhrashtachar hataane main naakaamayaab rahi
 So now all three are making an excuse to connect the MCCD

 There was a long debate about this from 2007 to 2011
 ek mukhya cameti ne emsidi ko paanch se saat bhaagon main baantne kii baat kahi thi, tab bijepi or congress donon ne sahmati bhi jataai thi
 All the mlas will be asked if such a proposal will come to the Aam Aadmi Party government
 har pahalu par house main bhi bahes hogi
 Questioning the lack of revenue in the MCD, Saurabh asked the BJP that if the situation is to be rectified, will there be a solution by merging the MCD? It is being said that there is a shortage of money
 lihaaja ek kar dena chahie, lekin revenue to tabhi badhegaa jab koshish kii jaaegi
 BJP says that South MCD is rich and East MCD is poor, but in comparison, the councilor of East MCD is richer than South MCD
 isaki vajah yah he ki parshad ke str par paisa jamkar lutaa ja rahaa he
 He said that BJP would see any benefit in this process
 haalanki teenon emsidi ko jod dene par bhi utana hi revenue aayega
 mcd's revenue will increase when corruption ends or the revenue going to councilors' pocket goes to mcd's pocket
 philhal aam aadmi party ko bijepi ke idia par aitraaj he
 However, earlier when the Deputy CM was asked the question, he was seen to be openly reacting to it
 aap pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj kaa kahana he ki teenon emsidi ko jodne kaa koi makasad nazar nahin aa rahaa he, kyonki bijepi 15 saal se emsidi main kaam nahin kar rahi he or ab yah maang uthaa rahi he
 BJP is postponing its work by making excuses

 Now there is a discussion in the Khans inside the Congress that who is the PM candidate of the party? If Rahul Gandhi again refuses to take command, then under whose position will the election be contested
 daavedaaron kii suchi main vitt mantri pi chidambaram, raksha mantri eke antni or grahamantri susheel kumaar scindia kaa naam to pehle se he hi par ek nae naam kii wild card ke taur par entry hui he
 According to the English newspaper 'times of India', sources suggest that Congress may make Nandan Nilekani, the doer of the Aadhaar Scheme (UID), its face in the Lok Sabha elections
 padhein puri khabarjaise hi ye baat saamne ai congress ke aalochakon ko party kii khinchaai karne ke liye ek or mudda mil gaya
 It was started by writer Chetan Bhagat
 
 
 
 So Congress has not learned anything: Chetan Bhagatchetan Bhagat tweeted, 'there are many rumors about the new PM candidate of Congress
 res main nandan nilekani bhi hai
 Interesting! ' He further tweeted, 'real PM or puppet PM
 ye congress ko tay karnaa he
 If Congress still chooses the other one, they have not learned anything yet
 'deepika padukon main kya kameeh pritish nandikhinchaai kaa silsilaa yaheen rukaa
 Journalist and filmmaker Pritish Nandy was sharper criticized than Chetan
 unhone is sambandh main chaar twit kiye
 Pritish Nandy tweeted, 'nandan Nilekani is the best choice as PM candidate
 wo congress ko puri khatm kar denge jaisaa aadhaar skim ke saath kiya
 Why does the Gandhi family choose losers again and again? ”pritish Nandy further wrote,“ If the Congress is looking for a PM candidate, then why not former Youth Congress leader Sushil Sharma who breaks his wife in pieces in Tandoor Is rotting in Tihar to be cut and burnt? ”pritish Nandy said,“ Sushil Sharma also has a somewhat life-threatening trend that was once discussed by the PM

 'this decision will be like suicide: JDUJDU MP Shivanand Tiwari said that if the Congress takes such decisions then it will be suicide
 jab shivanand tiwari se nilekani ke sambandh main sawaal kiya gaya to jawaab main unhone kaha, 'koun he nandan nilekani? isi main congress ja rahi he
 If the matter of projecting Nilekani for the post of PM is right, then this is the reason for the Congress' misfortune in the elections
 bhale hi angreji padhane vaale 4-5 fisadi log unhen jaanate hon par desh ke zyaadaatar log unhen nahin jaanata

 chaunkiye mat
 This has not happened
 agar aisa hota he to phir antakshri jaise aapke bhi kai aise pasandida khel honge jinhen aap oficial sports kii list main dekhnaa chaahate honge
 Hindi films have a long association with sports and sports have always been appreciated here
 lekin menstream sports ke alaava bhi kai timopas games yaa party games aise rahe jinhone darshakon ko film se baandhe rakhaa
 Some of such sports should also get the title of official sports
 ye rahe kuch khaas timopas khel
 
 
 1
 antakshri:bachapan ke is popular khel ko parde par pahchaan mili rajshri films se
 Here the servant and the maid also used to sit and enjoy Antakshari
 yah silsilaa 'maine pyaar kiya' se lekar'didlje'tak khub chalaa, or aaj bhi ghar-ghar main popular he
 2
 damb sharads:bina bole film ke naam kii acting karne kaa yah mjedaar khel'kuch kuch hota he'se lekar 'krishna cottage' tak or uske baad bhi kaaphi popular rahaa
 3
 train se res:adventure pasand logon kaa bhi bharpoor dhyaan rakhaa gaya he bollywood filmon main
 In 'ghulam', Aamir Khan and Deepak Tijori ran their lives towards the train, then in the movie 'apne', Bobby Deol raced the train in his training
 4
 Rooster games: In some countries of the world, games like cock fighting and hen race are quite popular
 aisi hi ek koshish 'tere bin laden' main bhi kii gai

 the calm before the storma post shared by Katrina Kaif (@katrinakaif) on Oct 24, 2017 at 9:19 am PDT upi vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey aa chuke hai, chaaron ore kesaria upi kii charchaa ho rahi he
 For the first time, BJP secured a thumping majority with 325 seats
 duusare number par akhilesh yadav kii samaajawaadee party rahi
 The SP won a total of 47 seats
 tisare number rahi mayawati kii bispi, vah 19 siton par chunaav jiti he
 The Congress won 7 seats
 ye rahaa vot sherapako bataa den ki in vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi ne kul 384 siton par apane ummidavaar utaare the
 Apna Dal had fielded candidates in 11 seats and SBSP in 8 seats
 vot share kii baat karen to bijepi ko kul 39
 Got 7% votes
 uske sahyogi dalon main apana dal ko 1
 0% and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party 0
 7% vot mili
 That means 41 in favor of BJP
 4% vot pade
 Now, speaking of the second-ranked sp-congress alliance, the SP had fielded candidates for 311 assembly seats while the Congress in 114 places
 sapa ko chunaavon main kul 21
 8 per cent votes while Congress got 6
 2 pratishat
 This means a total of 28 per cent turnout in favor of the coalition
 bispi ke haq main kul 22
 2% votes were cast (BSP fielded candidates in all 403 seats)
 to kya kam nahin hua akhilesh kaa jaadooapako bataa den ki 2012 ke chunaavon main upi kii janata ne akhilesh ko bahumat saunpa tha
 In those elections, the SP had won a total of 224 seats while the total of 29 in its favor
 29 pratishat vot pade the
 BSP was the second to get a total of 80 seats, while its vote share was 25
 95 pratishat
 Clearly, in spite of such a strong Modi wave, Akhilesh's magic in terms of vote share has not diminished much because sp's vote share is 7
 49 pratishat kii kami ai he us par gathbandhan kaa asar zyada najar aata he
 Significantly, even after contesting 114 seats, the Congress got only 6
 2 pratishat vot hi mila he
 In the Lok Sabha elections, it was the same as in the recent Modi wave during the Lok Sabha elections in 2014, the bjp's feat was similar
 rajya kii kul 80 vidhansabha siton main se bijepi ko 71 or uski sahyogi apana dal ko 2 siton par jeet hasil hui thi
 While SP had to satisfy 5, Congress only 2 seats
 us modi lahar main bispi kaa to khaataa hi nahin khulaa tha
 Speaking of vote share, BJP got 42 of the total votes
 3 fisadi hissaa aayaa tha
 While his colleague Apna Dal 1
 0 pratishat, yani kul 43
 3% of the votes were in Modi's name
 sapa ko kul 22
 2%, 7 to Congress
 5% or bispi ko 19
 6% of the votes were received
 ab agar loksabhaa chunaavon main bijepi ke pradarshan kii tulana vidhansabha chunaavon se karen to pate hai ki bijepi ke paksh main vidhansabha chunaavon main apekshaakrit kam matdaan hua
