 a game is becoming very popular among Pakistani children these days
 game faansee dene kii prakriya ke bare main he
 The question is, why are Pakistani children playing this game? Who are these children hanging? These days a video is going viral on social media in which some children are playing the game of hanging
 yah video 22-23 second kaa he
 There is a street-like place
 pehali nazar main lagata he ki ye koi bacchon kaa khel he
 Because the age of children is also between 5-7 years
 inke haath main ek gudiya he
 The children are moving holding the doll with a slogan
 ye bachche saaf nahin bol paa rahe hai, lekin naaraa laga rahe hai
 a children's bicycle will also be seen, with a rung tied on the front wheel
 danda main ek rassi lataki hui he, or faansee kaa fanda bana hua he
 These children hang the noose around the doll's neck
 ek baccha kahata he asia ko idhar kar, doosraa kahata he, asia ko idhar kar
 After this, these children hang the doll on the noose, and shout - hanged
 kyon ye bachche is gudiya ko faansee laga rahe hai? ye bachche asia-asia kyon bol rahe hai? kya ye vaaki khel he yaa phir koi khaufnak sach? is video kii sachai jaanane chaahate the, or ye bhi jaananaa chaahate the ki ye asia bibi koun he? isiilie is video kaa viral test kiya
 Actually, Asiya Bibi hails from Pakistan
 takreeban aath saal pehle kii baat he
 She was choosing Phalse
 tapati dhoop thi
 Asiya felt thirsty
 sameep ke ek kuen par asia pani pine pahunchin
 There was already a water pot
 asia ne usase pani pi liya
 Asia was seen drinking some water and saw some women present there
 iske baad asia or anya mahilaon main bahes hui
 The women being debated were Muslims while Asia was Christian
 musalmaan auraten kah rahi thim ki asia ne us bartan main pani pikar use apavitra kar diya he
 This debate started from here and reached the Prophet and Christ
 isi dauraan asia ne shaayad rau main bahakar paigambar kii tulana isa se kar di
 The women said, you have insulted the Prophet, that is, blasphemy, the battle started from the well then reached the police station, went to the court from there, the lower court sentenced Asiya to death
 maamla pakistan ke supreme court main pahunchaa or asia bibi ko bari kar diya gaya
 There was an uproar in Pakistan on this
 hazaron log sadakon par utar aae
 There was opposition to the release of Asia across Pakistan
 asia bibi kaa vakil itnaa dar gaya ki pakistan hi chhodkar bhaag gaya, or isi maahaul ne bacchon ke dilon main asia bibi ke liye nafrat paidaa kar di
 This video is the result of that
 pakistan ke bachche gudiya ko asia bibi bataakar faansee par lataka rahe hai
 In this way, these videos passed the viral test

 The Chief Minister said in a program organized in Kalvin Talukaidar College premises here that the SP government, irrespective of all the speculations of the opposition, distributed laptops to about 10,000 students and gave them an opportunity to step into a new world

 He said, 'laptops and Internet have changed everything today, whether it is government work or the field of education
 ham chaahate hai ki kal duniya yah nahin kah paye ki aapane internet aadhaarit pragatisheel padhai nahin kii he
 You do not have inferiority complex, so SP Government has tried to bring you on a par by giving you a laptop

 internet ke jariye ye bachche ek nayi duniya main kadam rakhenge or unhen pragatisheel padhai kaa laabh lene kaa mauka milegaa
 'it is worth mentioning that in his manifesto for the last year's assembly elections in SP, he had promised to give intermediate to students who enroll in the next class by passing laptops and free tablets to the students who have taken admission in the next grade by passing high school
 akhilesh ne kaha ki vipakshi kah rahe the ki laptop vitaran ke liye pariyojna banegi hi nahin or agar ban gayi to laptop batenge nahin, lekin sapa sarkaar ne apana vaada puraa kar diya he
 Attacking the opposition parties, the chief minister said, "the manifesto is the most important document of any party
" ek party (basapa) ne kabhi ghoshnaptr nahin banaaya
 There is a party (BJP) that retracts after making a promise
 sapa ne kathani or kerani main koi fark nahin kiya he
 We have tried to fulfill the promises in a year
 ’ apane hamale jari rakhte hue unhone kaha ‘hamane kabhi kisi par aarope nahin lagaaya
 If there was a riot, we took action against those responsible
 kahin bhagdad hoti he to ham kisi par aarope nahin lagaayenge, pehle logon ko surakshit kaise pahunchaaen, yah sochenge
 There are many people who try to take political advantage over such an incident
 ’akhilesh ne aarope lagaaya ki puraani sarkaron kii galat nitiyon ke kaaran hi berogari badi he
 The government is trying to create employment opportunities
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar pradesh main vikaas kaaryo par jor de rahi he
 Whether it is in the field of agriculture, health or it can curb corruption

 taapasi ne kyon kaha- acting hi chhod detii hum?deccan chronical se baatcheet mentapasi ne kaha- ek kaam karti hum main acting karnaa chhod detii hum

 Ganga is calling all those whom she keeps calling many times a year
 wo chaahati he ki ve saare log uskaa haal dekhen or bataaen ki uskaa pani saaf kyon nahin hua ? pani kam kyon hota ja rahaa he or gaad se bhari ganga kab saaf hogi
 If you have ever been called by Mother Ganga, then please go to Benaras at this time, because there are two schemes related to Ganga want to ask you something
 namaami gange ke tahat saaf pani nahin dikh rahaa he balki pani hi nahin dikh rahaa he or jalmaarg banane ke bade elaan kaa haal ye he ki ganga kii godi main jab baaluu or mitti kii gaad dekhenge to aapako sirf gilli danda khilne kaa khyaal aayega, jahaaz chalaane kaa nahin
 The third question is why the water alert issued in Benares came about
 in teen sawaalon ke liye ganga sabko khoj rahi he, balki phir se bula rahi he
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has also said in Patna on Sunday that the waterway cannot be developed without removing silt from the Ganges
 jab tak nadi aviral nahin hogi wo nirmal bhi nahin hogi
 Nitish Kumar also said that moss has frozen near Buxar, which means that the water is less and polluted
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne jo kaha he, ho saktaa he ki kendiy jahazrani mantri nitin gadakari ko sunne main acha nahin lage, magar yahi to dikhaane or bataane ke liye ganga sabko bula rahi he
 We thought that on this excuse, we tell the condition of the Ganges
 hamane apane sahyogi pushpendra ko baxur main us jagah par bheja jahaan wo malwahak jahaaz ganga kii gaad main fansaa hua he
 This freighter named Ravindra Nath Tagore near Buxar seems to be carrying potato sand but sailed from Kolkata, Chausa so that cement can be loaded, but it gets stuck near Buxar before reaching Chausa
 yah jahaaj Inland Waterways Authority of India kaa he
 Where this ship is stuck, the depth is only one and a half meter
 ise nikaalane ke liye bheja gaya doosraa jahaaz bhi das kilometre pehle ganga main jami gaad main funs gaya he
 The eight people trapped in this deserted ship will not know anything
 ganga nadi kaa baadh hi donon jahaazon ko nikaal saktaa he
 When the medium-class ship cannot operate, then the dream of running a cargo ship in the Ganges can be sold
 haalat ye he ki is gaad ko lekar bihar sarkaar ne 25 se 27 disambar ke bich ek hawaii surveykshan karaayaa
 December to June arrived but the report has not been finalized due to several reasons
 kya centre sarkaar bataa sakati he ki uske paas gaad hataane ke liye kya niti he or kya takanic he
 We are again showing this picture so that we can tell that the Indian government was very serious about its plan
 bharat main nadiyon main jalmaarg banane ke liye 1986 se Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) kaam kar rahaa he magar 2014 ke baad isamen tezi ai he
 Its vice-president Praveer Pandey told the Indian Express that in 2014 the Government of India announced the National Waterways Forest Project that the Ganga river was to be prepared for nine transports between Allahabad to Haldia at a cost of Rs 5369 crore
 ab bataaiye jab ye do jahaaz nahin chal sakate to kya is root main bina gaad nikaale yah yojana kabhi safal ho sakegi
 Showing its seriousness, the government also passed the National Waterways Act 2016
 varanasi, sahibganj or bengal ke haldiya main terminal bananaa he
 For a cargo vessel of 1500 tons capacity, the water depth should be at least three meters
 khaastaur par oktober se april ke bich jab nadiyon main pani kam ho jaataa he tab ye gaharaai kai jagah milani mushkil ho jaati he, kyonki nadiyon main kaafii gaad bhar chuki he
 
 
 a plan of more than 5000 crores was made, but no one was able to solve the basic problem
 kosi nadi par aaajeevan kaam karte rahane vaale pro dinesh mishra ne bataaya ki ek farkka baraj ne ganga kii barbaadi tay kar di or ab elahabaad se patna ke bich jahaazon ke avaagaman ke liye 100 kimi par baraj banane kaa prastaav he jo ganga ko or adhik barbaad kar degaa
 According to the media report, at the Ganga Manthan meeting in 2014, Nitin Gadkari suggested that a barrage should be built every hundred km
 jo ganga ko nahin jaanate hai unheen ke paas aisa idia hota he
 These experts are asking that the condition of Ganga due to the formation of a barrage is similar to the condition of the Ganges before Farakka, which will guarantee that every barrage will not have it
 hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ganga par disambar se hi report kar rahe hai ki nadi suukh rahi he
 In the month of December itself, the Ganges started shrinking, which continued to shrink in the months ahead
 baaluu ke tile dikhne lage
 Ganga started leaving the ghat
 ganga ko jaanane vaale tabhi samaj gaye ki garmiyon main ganga suukh jaaegi
 Gad Ganga lovers were made to cry instead of stream
 log hairaan the ki kabhi ganga ko sardiyon main sookhte nahin dekha he
 Why is this happening
 ganga ko lekar gambhirtha kii baat karenge to rone dhone se lekar krodhit rup dhaaran kar na jane kitne netaa aa jaaenge magar jo ganga kaa adhyayan karte hai wo jaanate hai ki slogan main swarg nahin hota he
 So much budget was made about Ganga, so many meetings were held, how did it happen that no work has started yet to remove silt
 ye aaj kii ganga kii tasviir he
 Ganga is seen in this condition even after listening to Ganga Ganga for four years
 ajay singh ke camere se aap tak ganga kii jo tasviir pahunch rahi he use dekhakar aapkaa dil to dahal hi rahaa hoga ki ye ganga ko kya hota ja rahaa he
 Why the policies and slogans of cleanliness are not showing the result
 kya jo hona chahie tha wo na hokar kuch or ho rahaa he
 We spoke to both Professor Dinesh Mishra and Himanshu Thakkar
 donon ko pataa he ki gaad kaise hategi kisi ko pataa nahin he
 Himanshu Thakkar said that even if we remove silt from the Ganges, where will we take it
 nadi ke ek or jaankaar kalyaan rudra ne ek anumaan lagaaya tha ki ganga main har saal 20 se 30 karod ton gaad jamaa hota he
 To remove it, if you park another truck behind a truck, then there will be many rounds of the earth
 43 saal se ye gaad jamaa ho rahaa he, ise nikaalnaa asambhav he
 Ganga demands concrete action
 wo kahaan ho rahi he
 Banaras had full faith and even today that Ganga will remain with her, but the Ganges is not able to give drinking water to the same Banaras
 haalat yah he ki 21 june ko banaras main water adwiseri jari hua he
 It has been written that the pumping of raw water has been reduced due to extremely low water level in the Ganges river
 shahar se apil kii jaati he ki zarurat ke hisaab se pine kaa pani jamaa kar rakhen
 Those who know the city say that they have never heard of this before, but the Jalanigam has given a clear warning to reduce the use of water, the supply will be less in the coming days and there may be a halt
 banaras main jalakal vibhaag 311 emeldi pani saaf karata he jisamen 100 emeldi ganga kaa hota he
 211 MLD is through tubewells
 ganga main pani nahin hone ke kaaran ek pump band karnaa padaa he or doosraa pump bhi band ho saktaa he
 Our colleague Ajay Singh said that there is a water pump in Bhadaini from where water is supplied
 jiske liye ganga se hote hue pump stesan kii pipe line bhadaini stesan par maujuud kuon main laai gai he
 It is necessary that the pipeline be submerged at least 15 feet in the Ganges
 magar is vakt yah pile mahaz ek feet ganga main duba hua he, jiske kaaran pump pani khinch nahin paa rahaa he
 One pump is turned off and the other which is on is only one foot up due to which a huge vortex is being formed when water is being drawn which is a warning of danger
 yah bataa rahaa he ki ganga main pani kii kami ke kaaran pump kaam nahin kar rahaa he
 There are five pumps and only three are running
 ye us jagah kaa haal he jahaan desh ke chotii ke niti nirmaataaon kii har vakt nazar rahati he
 Under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Mission in Benares, 42 overhead tanks have been built at a cost of 201 crores
 lekin 42 main se 10 hi kaam kar rahe hai
 Overhead tanks have been erected for five years and many are yet to be commissioned
 banaras main logon ko jitna ko pani chahie usase kareeb 40 fisadi kam mil rahaa he phir bhi banaras ke log kismat vaale hai ki itnaa pani mil ja rahaa he
 Yes people also have some complaints about the quality of water
 ganga sankat main he, banaras sankat main he
 Plans are being made looking at the sky and the ground is being moved quietly
 aakhir ham nadiyon ko bachaa kyon nahin paa rahe hai
 Is our path not right, what is the right path, those who know are also upset
 haridwar kii sanstha matrusadan ke sant or paryaavarnavid professor jidi agarwal amran anshan par baith gaye hai
 They say that activities like mining in the Ganges and river rafting for recreational activities are degrading to the Ganges and should be banned
 wo ganga par banaae ja rahe baandhon ke bhi virodh main hai jo uski aviral dhara ko roak rahe hai
 Himanshu Thakkar is talking about Prof
 Aggarwal, Dinesh Mishra is saying and Nitish Kumar is saying
 tippaniyan Swami Gyanaswaroop Sanand, who was a professor of IIT Kanpur, has sat on a 38-day hunger strike earlier
 agast 2010 main unke anshan ke baad centre sarkaar ke teen mantriyon ke group ne bhagirathi nadi par ban rahe lohari nagpala project ko radd kar diya tha lekin ganga par banane vaale kai or baandh hai jo ab bhi uski aviralata main baadha ban rahe hai
 After watching prime time, only the government can take a picture and tweet where the drains are closed in the Ganges, where the treatment plant is cleaned of dirty water first and then falls in the Ganges
 ye sab kaam mantri ji paanch minute main twit kar bataa sakate hai
 2814 crore has been spent in building sewage related infrastructure, then it should be known and the outcome should be discussed
 agar aap sahi sawaal puuchhenge to sarkaar avashya bataaegi, kyonki wo bhi ganga se bahut pyaar karti he
 From Gangotri to Gangasagar, about 12000 MLD of sewage falls in the Ganges, but so far only 4000 MLD sewage treatment facility has been established, out of which only 1000 MLD sewage is still being treated
 chaar saal baad 12000 emeldi ganda pani main se sirf 1000 emeldi ganda pani saaf hokar gir rahaa he
 20,000 crore is to be spent in five years under Namami Gange
 is project ke tahat aath rajyon main 193 pariyojnaon ke liye 20,601 karod rupee kii manzuri di gai, lekin da hindu ke jaikab kosi kii 9 may 2018 ko prakashit ek report ke mutabik march 2018 tak is fund kaa sirf paanchvaan hissaa yani 4,254 karod rupye hi kharch ho paye the
 
 barsaat se ganga bhar jaaegi, uskaa sankat nahin dikhegaa magar banaras vaale apni ganga ko disbanr se hi dekh rahe hai
 Just they are not visible because they are looking at something else
 ravivaar ko patna main bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne bhi kaha he ki ganga main jame gaad ko hataae bina jalmaarg kaa vikaas nahin ho saktaa he
 As long as the river is not continuous it will not be pure
 nitish kumaar ne yah bhi kaha ki baxur ke paas kaai jam gai he iskaa matlab yah hua ki pani kam he or pradooshit he
 What Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has said may not sound good to Union Shipping Minister Nitin Gadkari, but this is what Ganga is calling everyone to show and tell
 hamane sochaa ki isi bahaane ham ganga kaa haal bataate hai
 We sent our colleague Pushpendra to the place in Buxar where the cargo ship is stuck in the silt of the Ganges
 baxur ke paas ravindra nath tagore naam kaa yah malwahak jahaaz aalu baaluu ladane vaala lagata he magar kolkata se chalaa tha, chausa taaki cement ladakar laayaa ja sake, magar chausa pahunchane se pehle hi baxur ke paas funs gaya
 The ship belongs to the Inland Waterways Authority of India
 jahaan par yah jahaaz fansaa he vahaan gaharaai maatr sava meter he
 The second ship sent to evacuate it has also been trapped in the silt in the Ganges ten kilometers ago
 sunsaan main khadaa yah jahaaz kab nikalegaa isamen fanse aath logon ko kuch pataa nahin he
 Only the flood of the Ganges river can take out both ships
 jab madhyam shrenee kaa jahaaz nahin chal saktaa he tab phir ganga main malwahak jahaaz chalaane kaa sapana hi bechaa ja saktaa he
 The condition is that the Bihar government conducted an aerial survey between 25 to 27 December about this silt
 disambar se june aa gaya magar kai kaarnon se report ko antim rup nahin diya ja sakaa he
 Can the central government tell what policy and technology it has for removing silt
 ham phir se is tasviir ko dikhaa rahe hai taaki ham bataa saken ki bharat sarkaar apni is yojana ko lekar kaaphi gambhir thi
 Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) has been working since 1986 to create waterways in rivers in India, but has gained momentum since 2014
 iske upaadhyaksh praveer pandey ne 'indian express' ko bataaya tha ki 2014 main bharat sarkaar ne neshnal watervaiz van project kaa elaan kiya ki 5369 karod kii laagat se elahabaad se haldiya ke bich ganga nadi ko nau parivahan ke liye taiyaar kiya janaa tha
 Now tell, when these two ships cannot run, will this scheme ever succeed without removing silt in this route
 sarkaar ne apni gambhirtha dikhaate hue National Waterways Act 2016 bhi paas kiya
 Terminals are to be built in Varanasi, Sahebganj and Haldia in Bengal
 1500 ton kshamta vaale malwahak jahaaj ke liye pani kii gaharaai kam se teen meter kii honi chahie
 Particularly between October and April, when the water in the rivers gets less, then it becomes difficult to find these depths at many places, because there is a lot of silt in the rivers
 
 
 5000 karod se adhik kii yojana ban gai, magar buniyadi samasya kaa hal nikaalane kii sud kisi ko nahin ai
 Prof
 Dinesh Mishra, who has been working for a lifetime on the Kosi river, said that a Farakka barrage fixed the ruin of the Ganges and now it is proposed to build a 100 km barrage between Allahabad to Patna for the movement of ships which further ruins the Ganges
 will do it
 media report ke anusaar 2014 main ganga manthan baithak main nitin gadakari ne hi suzav har sau kimi par baraj banaaya janaa chahie
 Those who do not know the Ganges have such an idea
 ye export puch rahe hai ki baraj banane se ganga kii haalat farkka ke pehle vaali ganga kii jaisi haalat he, waisi haalat har baraj ke paas nahin hogi, isaki guarantee koun degaa
 Our colleague Ajay Singh has been reporting on the Ganges since December that the river is drying up
 disambar ke maheene main hi ganga sikudne lagi jo aage ke maheenon main bhi sikudti rahi
 Sand dunes started appearing
 ganga ghat chhodane lagi
 Only those who knew the Ganges understood that the Ganges would dry up in summer
 dhara kii jagah ganga kii peti main failaa gaad ganga premiyon ko rulaa gaya
 People were surprised that they have never seen the Ganges dry in winter
 aisa kyon ho rahaa he
 If we talk about the seriousness of Ganga, then how many leaders will come from being weepy to crying and taking angry forms, but those who study Ganga know that there is no heaven in slogan
 ganga ko lekar itnaa bajet bana, itani baithken huin, yah kaise hua ki gaad hataane ko lekar abhi tak koi kaam shuru nahi hua he
 This is the picture of today's Ganges
 chaar saal se ganga ganga sunne ke baad bhi ganga is haalat main dikh rahi he
 Seeing the picture of Ganga reaching you from Ajay Singh's camera, you must have been shocked that what is happening to Ganga
 saaf karne kii nitiyaan or naare nateeja kyon nahin dikhaa paa rahe hai
 Is there anything else happening instead of what should have happened? hamane professor dinesh mishra or himanshu thakkar donon se baat kii
 They both know how Gad will be lost
 himanshu thakkar ne kaha ki ganga se gaad hataayenge bhi to kahaan le jaaenge
 Kalyan Rudra, another expert on the river had estimated that Ganga accumulates 200 to 30 million tonnes of silt every year
 ise hataane ke liye ek trek ke peeche aap doosraa trek khadaa karenge to dharti ke kai chakkar lag jaaenge
 This silt has been accumulating for 43 years, it is impossible to remove it
 ganga thos karrwai maangati he
 Where is she happening banaras ko puraa bharosa tha or aaj bhi he ki ganga uske paas rahegi hi magar usee banaras ko ganga pine kaa pani nahin de paa rahi he
 The condition is that on June 21, Water Advisory has been released in Benares
 isamen likhaa he ki ganga nadi main jalastr atyadhik kam hone ke kaaran ro water kii pumping kam kar di gai he
 It is appealed to the city to store drinking water as per the requirement
 shahar ko jaanane vaale kehete hai ki pehle kabhi aisa nahi suna magar jalanigam ne saaf saaf chetavanee de di he ki pani kaa istamaal kam karen, aane vaale dinon main aapurti kam hogi or thapp bhi ho sakati he
 The water department in Banaras cleans 311 MLD of water with 100 MLD of Ganga
 211 emeldi nalakup ke zarie hota he
 Due to the lack of water in the Ganges, one pump has to be closed and the other pump may also be closed
 hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ne bataaya ki bhadaini main yah water pump he jahaan se pani kii supplai hoti he
 For this, the pipeline of the pump station through the Ganges has been brought to the wells at Bhadaini station
 us pipe line kaa ganga main kam se kam 15 feet duba hona zaruri he
 But at the moment this pile is submerged in the Ganges by just one foot, due to which the pump is not able to draw water
 ek pump band ho gaya he or doosraa jo chaalu he wo maatr ek foot upar he jiske kaaran jab pani khinch rahaa he to bada sa bhavar ban rahaa he jo khatre kii chetavanee he
 It is telling that the pump is not working due to lack of water in the Ganges
 yahaan paanch pump he or teen hi chal rahe hai
 This is the condition of the place where the top policy makers of the country keep an eye on them all the time
 banaras main jawaharlal nehru urban mishan ke tahat 201 karod kii laagat se 42 overhead tanks bane hai
 But only 10 out of 42 are working
 paanch saal se overhead tanks banakar khadey hai or kai to abhi tak chaalu nahin hue hai
 In Benaras, people are getting 40% less than what they want, yet the people of Benaras are lucky to get so much water
 haa logon ko pani kii gunvattta ko lekar kuch shikayate bhi hai
 Ganga is in crisis, Banaras is in crisis
 yojanaayen aasmaan kii taraf dekhakar banaai ja rahi hai or zamin chupchaap khiskate ja rahi he
 After all, why are we not able to save the rivers? kya hamaara rasta sahi nahin he, sahi rasta kya he jo jaanate hai wo bhi pareshaan hai
 Professor GD Aggarwal, a saint and environmentalist of Matrisadan, an institution of Haridwar, has sat on a hunger strike
 unka kahana he ki ganga main ho rahaa khanan or jagah jagah par manoranjan ke liye ho rahi river rafting jaisi gatividhiyaan ganga ke liye apmanjanak he or is sabpar pabandi honi chahie
 They are also in opposition to the dams being built on the Ganges, which are blocking its continuous flow
 pro agarwal kii baat hi himanshu thakkar kah rahe hai, dinesh mishra kah rahe hai or nitish kumaar kah rahe hai
 The comments iaiti kanpur ke professor rah chuke swami gyanaswaroop sanand wo pehle bhi ganga ko lekar 38 din ke anshan par baith chuke hai
 Following his fast in August 2010, a group of three ministers of the central government canceled the Lohari Nagpala project being built on the Bhagirathi River but there are many more dams on the Ganga that are still hampering its avidity
 prime time dekhne ke baad sarkaar hi tasviir khinch kar twit kar sakati he ki ganga main kahaan kahaan naale band hue he, kahaan kahaan treetment plant lagaakar pehle ganda pani saaf hota he or phir ganga main girtaa he
 All these works can be told by tweeting in five minutes
 sivej se jude buniyadi dhaanche ko banane main 2814 karod rupee kharch hue hai to ise jaananaa bhi chahie or iske nattejey par baat bhi honi chahie
 If you ask the right questions, then the government will definitely tell, because she also loves Ganga very much
 gangotri se gangasagar tak ganga main qareeb 12000 emeldi ganda pani yani sivej girtaa he, lekin abhi tak sirf 4000 emeldi sivej ko hi treet karne kii suvidha sthapit ho pai he jisamen se sirf 1000 emeldi sivej hi abhi treet yani saafe kiya ja rahaa he
 Four years later, out of 12000 MLD dirty water, only 1000 MLD dirty water is falling cleanly

 The rain will fill the Ganges, its crisis will not be seen, but the people of Banaras have been watching their Ganga since December

 The rain will fill the Ganges, its crisis will not be seen, but the people of Banaras have been watching their Ganga since December
 bas unhen dikhaai nahin de rahaa he kyonki wo kuch or dekh rahe hai
 When the medium-class ship cannot operate, then the dream of running a cargo ship in the Ganges can be sold
 haalat ye he ki is gaad ko lekar bihar sarkaar ne 25 se 27 disambar ke bich ek hawaii surveykshan karaayaa
 December to June arrived but the report has not been finalized due to several reasons
 kya centre sarkaar bataa sakati he ki uske paas gaad hataane ke liye kya niti he or kya takanic he
 We are again showing this picture so that we can tell that the Indian government was very serious about its plan
 bharat main nadiyon main jalmaarg banane ke liye 1986 se Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) kaam kar rahaa he magar 2014 ke baad isamen tezi ai he
 Its vice-president Praveer Pandey told the Indian Express that in 2014 the Government of India announced the National Waterways Forest Project that the Ganga river was to be prepared for nine transports between Allahabad to Haldia at a cost of Rs 5369 crore
 ab bataaiye jab ye do jahaaz nahin chal sakate to kya is root main bina gaad nikaale yah yojana kabhi safal ho sakegi
 Showing its seriousness, the government also passed the National Waterways Act 2016
 varanasi, sahibganj or bengal ke haldiya main terminal bananaa he
 For a cargo vessel of 1500 tons capacity, the water depth should be at least three meters
 khaastaur par oktober se april ke bich jab nadiyon main pani kam ho jaataa he tab ye gaharaai kai jagah milani mushkil ho jaati he, kyonki nadiyon main kaafii gaad bhar chuki he
 
 
 a plan of more than 5000 crores was made, but no one was able to solve the basic problem
 kosi nadi par aaajeevan kaam karte rahane vaale pro dinesh mishra ne bataaya ki ek farkka baraj ne ganga kii barbaadi tay kar di or ab elahabaad se patna ke bich jahaazon ke avaagaman ke liye 100 kimi par baraj banane kaa prastaav he jo ganga ko or adhik barbaad kar degaa
 According to the media report, at the Ganga Manthan meeting in 2014, Nitin Gadkari suggested that a barrage should be built every hundred km
 jo ganga ko nahin jaanate hai unheen ke paas aisa idia hota he
 These experts are asking that the condition of Ganga due to the formation of a barrage is similar to the condition of the Ganges before Farakka, which will guarantee that every barrage will not have it
 hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ganga par disambar se hi report kar rahe hai ki nadi suukh rahi he
 In the month of December itself, the Ganges started shrinking, which continued to shrink in the months ahead
 baaluu ke tile dikhne lage
 Ganga started leaving the ghat
 ganga ko jaanane vaale tabhi samaj gaye ki garmiyon main ganga suukh jaaegi
 Gad Ganga lovers were made to cry instead of stream
 log hairaan the ki kabhi ganga ko sardiyon main sookhte nahin dekha he
 Why is this happening
 ganga ko lekar gambhirtha kii baat karenge to rone dhone se lekar krodhit rup dhaaran kar na jane kitne netaa aa jaaenge magar jo ganga kaa adhyayan karte hai wo jaanate hai ki slogan main swarg nahin hota he
 So much budget was made about Ganga, so many meetings were held, how did it happen that no work has started yet to remove silt
 ye aaj kii ganga kii tasviir he
 Ganga is seen in this condition even after listening to Ganga Ganga for four years
 ajay singh ke camere se aap tak ganga kii jo tasviir pahunch rahi he use dekhakar aapkaa dil to dahal hi rahaa hoga ki ye ganga ko kya hota ja rahaa he
 Why the policies and slogans of cleanliness are not showing the result
 kya jo hona chahie tha wo na hokar kuch or ho rahaa he
 We spoke to both Professor Dinesh Mishra and Himanshu Thakkar
 donon ko pataa he ki gaad kaise hategi kisi ko pataa nahin he
 Himanshu Thakkar said that even if we remove silt from the Ganges, where will we take it
 nadi ke ek or jaankaar kalyaan rudra ne ek anumaan lagaaya tha ki ganga main har saal 20 se 30 karod ton gaad jamaa hota he
 To remove it, if you park another truck behind a truck, then there will be many rounds of the earth
 43 saal se ye gaad jamaa ho rahaa he, ise nikaalnaa asambhav he
 Ganga demands concrete action
 wo kahaan ho rahi he
 Banaras had full faith and even today that Ganga will remain with her, but the Ganges is not able to give drinking water to the same Banaras
 haalat yah he ki 21 june ko banaras main water adwiseri jari hua he
 It has been written that the pumping of raw water has been reduced due to extremely low water level in the Ganges river
 shahar se apil kii jaati he ki zarurat ke hisaab se pine kaa pani jamaa kar rakhen
 Those who know the city say that they have never heard of this before, but the Jalanigam has given a clear warning to reduce the use of water, the supply will be less in the coming days and there may be a halt
 banaras main jalakal vibhaag 311 emeldi pani saaf karata he jisamen 100 emeldi ganga kaa hota he
 211 MLD is through tubewells
 ganga main pani nahin hone ke kaaran ek pump band karnaa padaa he or doosraa pump bhi band ho saktaa he
 Our colleague Ajay Singh said that there is a water pump in Bhadaini from where water is supplied
 jiske liye ganga se hote hue pump stesan kii pipe line bhadaini stesan par maujuud kuon main laai gai he
 It is necessary that the pipeline be submerged at least 15 feet in the Ganges
 magar is vakt yah pile mahaz ek feet ganga main duba hua he, jiske kaaran pump pani khinch nahin paa rahaa he
 One pump is turned off and the other which is on is only one foot up due to which a huge vortex is being formed when water is being drawn which is a warning of danger
 yah bataa rahaa he ki ganga main pani kii kami ke kaaran pump kaam nahin kar rahaa he
 There are five pumps and only three are running
 ye us jagah kaa haal he jahaan desh ke chotii ke niti nirmaataaon kii har vakt nazar rahati he
 Under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Mission in Benares, 42 overhead tanks have been built at a cost of 201 crores
 lekin 42 main se 10 hi kaam kar rahe hai
 Overhead tanks have been erected for five years and many are yet to be commissioned
 banaras main logon ko jitna ko pani chahie usase kareeb 40 fisadi kam mil rahaa he phir bhi banaras ke log kismat vaale hai ki itnaa pani mil ja rahaa he
 Yes people also have some complaints about the quality of water
 ganga sankat main he, banaras sankat main he
 Plans are being made looking at the sky and the ground is being moved quietly
 aakhir ham nadiyon ko bachaa kyon nahin paa rahe hai
 Is our path not right, what is the right path, those who know are also upset
 haridwar kii sanstha matrusadan ke sant or paryaavarnavid professor jidi agarwal amran anshan par baith gaye hai
 They say that activities like mining in the Ganges and river rafting for recreational activities are degrading to the Ganges and should be banned
 wo ganga par banaae ja rahe baandhon ke bhi virodh main hai jo uski aviral dhara ko roak rahe hai
 Himanshu Thakkar is talking about Prof
 Aggarwal, Dinesh Mishra is saying and Nitish Kumar is saying
 tippaniyan Swami Gyanaswaroop Sanand, who was a professor of IIT Kanpur, has sat on a 38-day hunger strike earlier
 agast 2010 main unke anshan ke baad centre sarkaar ke teen mantriyon ke group ne bhagirathi nadi par ban rahe lohari nagpala project ko radd kar diya tha lekin ganga par banane vaale kai or baandh hai jo ab bhi uski aviralata main baadha ban rahe hai
 After watching prime time, only the government can take a picture and tweet where the drains are closed in the Ganges, where the treatment plant is cleaned of dirty water first and then falls in the Ganges
 ye sab kaam mantri ji paanch minute main twit kar bataa sakate hai
 2814 crore has been spent in building sewage related infrastructure, then it should be known and the outcome should be discussed
 agar aap sahi sawaal puuchhenge to sarkaar avashya bataaegi, kyonki wo bhi ganga se bahut pyaar karti he
 From Gangotri to Gangasagar, about 12000 MLD of sewage falls in the Ganges, but so far only 4000 MLD sewage treatment facility has been established, out of which only 1000 MLD sewage is still being treated
 chaar saal baad 12000 emeldi ganda pani main se sirf 1000 emeldi ganda pani saaf hokar gir rahaa he
 20,000 crore is to be spent in five years under Namami Gange
 is project ke tahat aath rajyon main 193 pariyojnaon ke liye 20,601 karod rupee kii manzuri di gai, lekin da hindu ke jaikab kosi kii 9 may 2018 ko prakashit ek report ke mutabik march 2018 tak is fund kaa sirf paanchvaan hissaa yani 4,254 karod rupye hi kharch ho paye the
 
 barsaat se ganga bhar jaaegi, uskaa sankat nahin dikhegaa magar banaras vaale apni ganga ko disbanr se hi dekh rahe hai
 Just they are not visible because they are looking at something else
 ham phir se is tasviir ko dikhaa rahe hai taaki ham bataa saken ki bharat sarkaar apni is yojana ko lekar kaaphi gambhir thi
 Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) has been working since 1986 to create waterways in rivers in India, but has gained momentum since 2014
 iske upaadhyaksh praveer pandey ne 'indian express' ko bataaya tha ki 2014 main bharat sarkaar ne neshnal watervaiz van project kaa elaan kiya ki 5369 karod kii laagat se elahabaad se haldiya ke bich ganga nadi ko nau parivahan ke liye taiyaar kiya janaa tha
 Now tell, when these two ships cannot run, will this scheme ever succeed without removing silt in this route
 sarkaar ne apni gambhirtha dikhaate hue National Waterways Act 2016 bhi paas kiya
 Terminals are to be built in Varanasi, Sahebganj and Haldia in Bengal
 1500 ton kshamta vaale malwahak jahaaj ke liye pani kii gaharaai kam se teen meter kii honi chahie
 Particularly between October and April, when the water in the rivers gets less, then it becomes difficult to find these depths at many places, because there is a lot of silt in the rivers
 
 
 5000 karod se adhik kii yojana ban gai, magar buniyadi samasya kaa hal nikaalane kii sud kisi ko nahin ai
 Prof
 Dinesh Mishra, who has been working for a lifetime on the Kosi river, said that a Farakka barrage fixed the ruin of the Ganges and now it is proposed to build a 100 km barrage between Allahabad to Patna for the movement of ships which further ruins the Ganges
 will do it
 media report ke anusaar 2014 main ganga manthan baithak main nitin gadakari ne hi suzav har sau kimi par baraj banaaya janaa chahie
 Those who do not know the Ganges have such an idea
 ye export puch rahe hai ki baraj banane se ganga kii haalat farkka ke pehle vaali ganga kii jaisi haalat he, waisi haalat har baraj ke paas nahin hogi, isaki guarantee koun degaa
 Our colleague Ajay Singh has been reporting on the Ganges since December that the river is drying up
 disambar ke maheene main hi ganga sikudne lagi jo aage ke maheenon main bhi sikudti rahi
 Sand dunes started appearing
 ganga ghat chhodane lagi
 Only those who knew the Ganges understood that the Ganges would dry up in summer
 dhara kii jagah ganga kii peti main failaa gaad ganga premiyon ko rulaa gaya
 People were surprised that they have never seen the Ganges dry in winter
 aisa kyon ho rahaa he
 If we talk about the seriousness of Ganga, then how many leaders will come from being weepy to crying and taking angry forms, but those who study Ganga know that there is no heaven in slogan
 ganga ko lekar itnaa bajet bana, itani baithken huin, yah kaise hua ki gaad hataane ko lekar abhi tak koi kaam shuru nahi hua he
 This is the picture of today's Ganges
 chaar saal se ganga ganga sunne ke baad bhi ganga is haalat main dikh rahi he
 Seeing the picture of Ganga reaching you from Ajay Singh's camera, you must have been shocked that what is happening to Ganga
 saaf karne kii nitiyaan or naare nateeja kyon nahin dikhaa paa rahe hai
 Is there anything else happening instead of what should have happened? hamane professor dinesh mishra or himanshu thakkar donon se baat kii
 They both know how Gad will be lost
 himanshu thakkar ne kaha ki ganga se gaad hataayenge bhi to kahaan le jaaenge
 Kalyan Rudra, another expert on the river had estimated that Ganga accumulates 200 to 30 million tonnes of silt every year
 ise hataane ke liye ek trek ke peeche aap doosraa trek khadaa karenge to dharti ke kai chakkar lag jaaenge
 This silt has been accumulating for 43 years, it is impossible to remove it
 ganga thos karrwai maangati he
 Where is she happening banaras ko puraa bharosa tha or aaj bhi he ki ganga uske paas rahegi hi magar usee banaras ko ganga pine kaa pani nahin de paa rahi he
 The condition is that on June 21, Water Advisory has been released in Benares
 isamen likhaa he ki ganga nadi main jalastr atyadhik kam hone ke kaaran ro water kii pumping kam kar di gai he
 It is appealed to the city to store drinking water as per the requirement
 shahar ko jaanane vaale kehete hai ki pehle kabhi aisa nahi suna magar jalanigam ne saaf saaf chetavanee de di he ki pani kaa istamaal kam karen, aane vaale dinon main aapurti kam hogi or thapp bhi ho sakati he
 The water department in Banaras cleans 311 MLD of water with 100 MLD of Ganga
 211 emeldi nalakup ke zarie hota he
 Due to the lack of water in the Ganges, one pump has to be closed and the other pump may also be closed
 hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ne bataaya ki bhadaini main yah water pump he jahaan se pani kii supplai hoti he
 For this, the pipeline of the pump station through the Ganges has been brought to the wells at Bhadaini station
 us pipe line kaa ganga main kam se kam 15 feet duba hona zaruri he
 But at the moment this pile is submerged in the Ganges by just one foot, due to which the pump is not able to draw water
 ek pump band ho gaya he or doosraa jo chaalu he wo maatr ek foot upar he jiske kaaran jab pani khinch rahaa he to bada sa bhavar ban rahaa he jo khatre kii chetavanee he
 It is telling that the pump is not working due to lack of water in the Ganges
 yahaan paanch pump he or teen hi chal rahe hai
 This is the condition of the place where the top policy makers of the country keep an eye on them all the time
 banaras main jawaharlal nehru urban mishan ke tahat 201 karod kii laagat se 42 overhead tanks bane hai
 But only 10 out of 42 are working
 paanch saal se overhead tanks banakar khadey hai or kai to abhi tak chaalu nahin hue hai
 In Benaras, people are getting 40% less than what they want, yet the people of Benaras are lucky to get so much water
 haa logon ko pani kii gunvattta ko lekar kuch shikayate bhi hai
 Ganga is in crisis, Banaras is in crisis
 yojanaayen aasmaan kii taraf dekhakar banaai ja rahi hai or zamin chupchaap khiskate ja rahi he
 After all, why are we not able to save the rivers? kya hamaara rasta sahi nahin he, sahi rasta kya he jo jaanate hai wo bhi pareshaan hai
 Professor GD Aggarwal, a saint and environmentalist of Matrisadan, an institution of Haridwar, has sat on a hunger strike
 unka kahana he ki ganga main ho rahaa khanan or jagah jagah par manoranjan ke liye ho rahi river rafting jaisi gatividhiyaan ganga ke liye apmanjanak he or is sabpar pabandi honi chahie
 They are also in opposition to the dams being built on the Ganges, which are blocking its continuous flow
 pro agarwal kii baat hi himanshu thakkar kah rahe hai, dinesh mishra kah rahe hai or nitish kumaar kah rahe hai
 The comments iaiti kanpur ke professor rah chuke swami gyanaswaroop sanand wo pehle bhi ganga ko lekar 38 din ke anshan par baith chuke hai
 Following his fast in August 2010, a group of three ministers of the central government canceled the Lohari Nagpala project being built on the Bhagirathi River but there are many more dams on the Ganga that are still hampering its avidity
 prime time dekhne ke baad sarkaar hi tasviir khinch kar twit kar sakati he ki ganga main kahaan kahaan naale band hue he, kahaan kahaan treetment plant lagaakar pehle ganda pani saaf hota he or phir ganga main girtaa he
 All these works can be told by tweeting in five minutes
 sivej se jude buniyadi dhaanche ko banane main 2814 karod rupee kharch hue hai to ise jaananaa bhi chahie or iske nattejey par baat bhi honi chahie
 If you ask the right questions, then the government will definitely tell, because she also loves Ganga very much
 gangotri se gangasagar tak ganga main qareeb 12000 emeldi ganda pani yani sivej girtaa he, lekin abhi tak sirf 4000 emeldi sivej ko hi treet karne kii suvidha sthapit ho pai he jisamen se sirf 1000 emeldi sivej hi abhi treet yani saafe kiya ja rahaa he
 Four years later, out of 12000 MLD dirty water, only 1000 MLD dirty water is falling cleanly
 namaami gange ke tahat paanch saal main 20,000 karod kharch hona he
 Under this project, Rs 20,601 crore has been approved for 193 projects in eight states, but according to a report published on 9 May 2018 by Jacob Koshi of The Hindu, only a fifth of this fund i
e
 Rs 4,254 crore was spent till March 2018
 Were able to happen
 
 The rain will fill the Ganges, its crisis will not be seen, but the people of Banaras have been watching their Ganga since December
 bas unhen dikhaai nahin de rahaa he kyonki wo kuch or dekh rahe hai
 Showing its seriousness, the government also passed the National Waterways Act 2016
 varanasi, sahibganj or bengal ke haldiya main terminal bananaa he
 For a cargo vessel of 1500 tons capacity, the water depth should be at least three meters
 khaastaur par oktober se april ke bich jab nadiyon main pani kam ho jaataa he tab ye gaharaai kai jagah milani mushkil ho jaati he, kyonki nadiyon main kaafii gaad bhar chuki he
 
 
 a plan of more than 5000 crores was made, but no one was able to solve the basic problem
 kosi nadi par aaajeevan kaam karte rahane vaale pro dinesh mishra ne bataaya ki ek farkka baraj ne ganga kii barbaadi tay kar di or ab elahabaad se patna ke bich jahaazon ke avaagaman ke liye 100 kimi par baraj banane kaa prastaav he jo ganga ko or adhik barbaad kar degaa
 According to the media report, at the Ganga Manthan meeting in 2014, Nitin Gadkari suggested that a barrage should be built every hundred km
 jo ganga ko nahin jaanate hai unheen ke paas aisa idia hota he
 These experts are asking that the condition of Ganga due to the formation of a barrage is similar to the condition of the Ganges before Farakka, which will guarantee that every barrage will not have it
 hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ganga par disambar se hi report kar rahe hai ki nadi suukh rahi he
 In the month of December itself, the Ganges started shrinking, which continued to shrink in the months ahead
 baaluu ke tile dikhne lage
 Ganga started leaving the ghat
 ganga ko jaanane vaale tabhi samaj gaye ki garmiyon main ganga suukh jaaegi
 Gad Ganga lovers were made to cry instead of stream
 log hairaan the ki kabhi ganga ko sardiyon main sookhte nahin dekha he
 Why is this happening
 ganga ko lekar gambhirtha kii baat karenge to rone dhone se lekar krodhit rup dhaaran kar na jane kitne netaa aa jaaenge magar jo ganga kaa adhyayan karte hai wo jaanate hai ki slogan main swarg nahin hota he
 So much budget was made about Ganga, so many meetings were held, how did it happen that no work has started yet to remove silt
 ye aaj kii ganga kii tasviir he
 Ganga is seen in this condition even after listening to Ganga Ganga for four years
 ajay singh ke camere se aap tak ganga kii jo tasviir pahunch rahi he use dekhakar aapkaa dil to dahal hi rahaa hoga ki ye ganga ko kya hota ja rahaa he
 Why the policies and slogans of cleanliness are not showing the result
 kya jo hona chahie tha wo na hokar kuch or ho rahaa he
 We spoke to both Professor Dinesh Mishra and Himanshu Thakkar
 donon ko pataa he ki gaad kaise hategi kisi ko pataa nahin he
 Himanshu Thakkar said that even if we remove silt from the Ganges, where will we take it
 nadi ke ek or jaankaar kalyaan rudra ne ek anumaan lagaaya tha ki ganga main har saal 20 se 30 karod ton gaad jamaa hota he
 To remove it, if you park another truck behind a truck, then there will be many rounds of the earth
 43 saal se ye gaad jamaa ho rahaa he, ise nikaalnaa asambhav he
 Ganga demands concrete action
 wo kahaan ho rahi he
 Banaras had full faith and even today that Ganga will remain with her, but the Ganges is not able to give drinking water to the same Banaras
 haalat yah he ki 21 june ko banaras main water adwiseri jari hua he
 It has been written that the pumping of raw water has been reduced due to extremely low water level in the Ganges river
 shahar se apil kii jaati he ki zarurat ke hisaab se pine kaa pani jamaa kar rakhen
 Those who know the city say that they have never heard of this before, but the Jalanigam has given a clear warning to reduce the use of water, the supply will be less in the coming days and there may be a halt
 banaras main jalakal vibhaag 311 emeldi pani saaf karata he jisamen 100 emeldi ganga kaa hota he
 211 MLD is through tubewells
 ganga main pani nahin hone ke kaaran ek pump band karnaa padaa he or doosraa pump bhi band ho saktaa he
 Our colleague Ajay Singh said that there is a water pump in Bhadaini from where water is supplied
 jiske liye ganga se hote hue pump stesan kii pipe line bhadaini stesan par maujuud kuon main laai gai he
 It is necessary that the pipeline be submerged at least 15 feet in the Ganges
 magar is vakt yah pile mahaz ek feet ganga main duba hua he, jiske kaaran pump pani khinch nahin paa rahaa he
 One pump is turned off and the other which is on is only one foot up due to which a huge vortex is being formed when water is being drawn which is a warning of danger
 yah bataa rahaa he ki ganga main pani kii kami ke kaaran pump kaam nahin kar rahaa he
 There are five pumps and only three are running
 ye us jagah kaa haal he jahaan desh ke chotii ke niti nirmaataaon kii har vakt nazar rahati he
 Under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Mission in Benares, 42 overhead tanks have been built at a cost of 201 crores
 lekin 42 main se 10 hi kaam kar rahe hai
 Overhead tanks have been erected for five years and many are yet to be commissioned
 banaras main logon ko jitna ko pani chahie usase kareeb 40 fisadi kam mil rahaa he phir bhi banaras ke log kismat vaale hai ki itnaa pani mil ja rahaa he
 Yes people also have some complaints about the quality of water
 ganga sankat main he, banaras sankat main he
 Plans are being made looking at the sky and the ground is being moved quietly
 aakhir ham nadiyon ko bachaa kyon nahin paa rahe hai
 Is our path not right, what is the right path, those who know are also upset
 haridwar kii sanstha matrusadan ke sant or paryaavarnavid professor jidi agarwal amran anshan par baith gaye hai
 They say that activities like mining in the Ganges and river rafting for recreational activities are degrading to the Ganges and should be banned
 wo ganga par banaae ja rahe baandhon ke bhi virodh main hai jo uski aviral dhara ko roak rahe hai
 Himanshu Thakkar is talking about Prof
 Aggarwal, Dinesh Mishra is saying and Nitish Kumar is saying
 tippaniyan Swami Gyanaswaroop Sanand, who was a professor of IIT Kanpur, has sat on a 38-day hunger strike earlier
 agast 2010 main unke anshan ke baad centre sarkaar ke teen mantriyon ke group ne bhagirathi nadi par ban rahe lohari nagpala project ko radd kar diya tha lekin ganga par banane vaale kai or baandh hai jo ab bhi uski aviralata main baadha ban rahe hai
 After watching prime time, only the government can take a picture and tweet where the drains are closed in the Ganges, where the treatment plant is cleaned of dirty water first and then falls in the Ganges
 ye sab kaam mantri ji paanch minute main twit kar bataa sakate hai
 2814 crore has been spent in building sewage related infrastructure, then it should be known and the outcome should be discussed
 agar aap sahi sawaal puuchhenge to sarkaar avashya bataaegi, kyonki wo bhi ganga se bahut pyaar karti he
 From Gangotri to Gangasagar, about 12000 MLD of sewage falls in the Ganges, but so far only 4000 MLD sewage treatment facility has been established, out of which only 1000 MLD sewage is still being treated
 chaar saal baad 12000 emeldi ganda pani main se sirf 1000 emeldi ganda pani saaf hokar gir rahaa he
 20,000 crore is to be spent in five years under Namami Gange

 The rain will fill the Ganges, its crisis will not be seen, but the people of Banaras have been watching their Ganga since December
 bas unhen dikhaai nahin de rahaa he kyonki wo kuch or dekh rahe hai
 If we talk about the seriousness of Ganga, then how many leaders will come from being weepy to crying and taking angry forms, but those who study Ganga know that there is no heaven in slogan
 ganga ko lekar itnaa bajet bana, itani baithken huin, yah kaise hua ki gaad hataane ko lekar abhi tak koi kaam shuru nahi hua he
 This is the picture of today's Ganges
 chaar saal se ganga ganga sunne ke baad bhi ganga is haalat main dikh rahi he
 Seeing the picture of Ganga reaching you from Ajay Singh's camera, you must have been shocked that what is happening to Ganga
 saaf karne kii nitiyaan or naare nateeja kyon nahin dikhaa paa rahe hai
 Is there anything else happening instead of what should have happened? hamane professor dinesh mishra or himanshu thakkar donon se baat kii
 They both know how Gad will be lost
 himanshu thakkar ne kaha ki ganga se gaad hataayenge bhi to kahaan le jaaenge
 Kalyan Rudra, another expert on the river had estimated that Ganga accumulates 200 to 30 million tonnes of silt every year
 ise hataane ke liye ek trek ke peeche aap doosraa trek khadaa karenge to dharti ke kai chakkar lag jaaenge
 This silt has been accumulating for 43 years, it is impossible to remove it
 ganga thos karrwai maangati he
 Where is she happening banaras ko puraa bharosa tha or aaj bhi he ki ganga uske paas rahegi hi magar usee banaras ko ganga pine kaa pani nahin de paa rahi he
 The condition is that on June 21, Water Advisory has been released in Benares
 isamen likhaa he ki ganga nadi main jalastr atyadhik kam hone ke kaaran ro water kii pumping kam kar di gai he
 It is appealed to the city to store drinking water as per the requirement
 shahar ko jaanane vaale kehete hai ki pehle kabhi aisa nahi suna magar jalanigam ne saaf saaf chetavanee de di he ki pani kaa istamaal kam karen, aane vaale dinon main aapurti kam hogi or thapp bhi ho sakati he
 The water department in Banaras cleans 311 MLD of water with 100 MLD of Ganga
 211 emeldi nalakup ke zarie hota he
 Due to the lack of water in the Ganges, one pump has to be closed and the other pump may also be closed
 hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ne bataaya ki bhadaini main yah water pump he jahaan se pani kii supplai hoti he
 For this, the pipeline of the pump station through the Ganges has been brought to the wells at Bhadaini station
 us pipe line kaa ganga main kam se kam 15 feet duba hona zaruri he
 But at the moment this pile is submerged in the Ganges by just one foot, due to which the pump is not able to draw water
 ek pump band ho gaya he or doosraa jo chaalu he wo maatr ek foot upar he jiske kaaran jab pani khinch rahaa he to bada sa bhavar ban rahaa he jo khatre kii chetavanee he
 It is telling that the pump is not working due to lack of water in the Ganges
 yahaan paanch pump he or teen hi chal rahe hai
 This is the condition of the place where the top policy makers of the country keep an eye on them all the time
 banaras main jawaharlal nehru urban mishan ke tahat 201 karod kii laagat se 42 overhead tanks bane hai
 But only 10 out of 42 are working
 paanch saal se overhead tanks banakar khadey hai or kai to abhi tak chaalu nahin hue hai
 In Benaras, people are getting 40% less than what they want, yet the people of Benaras are lucky to get so much water
 haa logon ko pani kii gunvattta ko lekar kuch shikayate bhi hai
 Ganga is in crisis, Banaras is in crisis
 yojanaayen aasmaan kii taraf dekhakar banaai ja rahi hai or zamin chupchaap khiskate ja rahi he
 After all, why are we not able to save the rivers? kya hamaara rasta sahi nahin he, sahi rasta kya he jo jaanate hai wo bhi pareshaan hai

 The rain will fill the Ganges, its crisis will not be seen, but the people of Banaras have been watching their Ganga since December
 bas unhen dikhaai nahin de rahaa he kyonki wo kuch or dekh rahe hai
 Himanshu Thakkar said that even if we remove silt from the Ganges, where will we take it
 nadi ke ek or jaankaar kalyaan rudra ne ek anumaan lagaaya tha ki ganga main har saal 20 se 30 karod ton gaad jamaa hota he
 To remove it, if you park another truck behind a truck, then there will be many rounds of the earth
 43 saal se ye gaad jamaa ho rahaa he, ise nikaalnaa asambhav he
 Ganga demands concrete action
 wo kahaan ho rahi he
 Banaras had full faith and even today that Ganga will remain with her, but the Ganges is not able to give drinking water to the same Banaras
 haalat yah he ki 21 june ko banaras main water adwiseri jari hua he
 It has been written that the pumping of raw water has been reduced due to extremely low water level in the Ganges river
 shahar se apil kii jaati he ki zarurat ke hisaab se pine kaa pani jamaa kar rakhen
 Those who know the city say that they have never heard of this before, but the Jalanigam has given a clear warning to reduce the use of water, the supply will be less in the coming days and there may be a halt
 banaras main jalakal vibhaag 311 emeldi pani saaf karata he jisamen 100 emeldi ganga kaa hota he
 211 MLD is through tubewells
 ganga main pani nahin hone ke kaaran ek pump band karnaa padaa he or doosraa pump bhi band ho saktaa he
 Our colleague Ajay Singh said that there is a water pump in Bhadaini from where water is supplied
 jiske liye ganga se hote hue pump stesan kii pipe line bhadaini stesan par maujuud kuon main laai gai he
 It is necessary that the pipeline be submerged at least 15 feet in the Ganges
 magar is vakt yah pile mahaz ek feet ganga main duba hua he, jiske kaaran pump pani khinch nahin paa rahaa he
 One pump is turned off and the other which is on is only one foot up due to which a huge vortex is being formed when water is being drawn which is a warning of danger
 yah bataa rahaa he ki ganga main pani kii kami ke kaaran pump kaam nahin kar rahaa he
 There are five pumps and only three are running
 ye us jagah kaa haal he jahaan desh ke chotii ke niti nirmaataaon kii har vakt nazar rahati he
 Under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Mission in Benares, 42 overhead tanks have been built at a cost of 201 crores
 lekin 42 main se 10 hi kaam kar rahe hai
 Overhead tanks have been erected for five years and many are yet to be commissioned
 banaras main logon ko jitna ko pani chahie usase kareeb 40 fisadi kam mil rahaa he phir bhi banaras ke log kismat vaale hai ki itnaa pani mil ja rahaa he
 Yes people also have some complaints about the quality of water
 ganga sankat main he, banaras sankat main he
 Plans are being made looking at the sky and the ground is being moved quietly
 aakhir ham nadiyon ko bachaa kyon nahin paa rahe hai
 Is our path not right, what is the right path, those who know are also upset
 haridwar kii sanstha matrusadan ke sant or paryaavarnavid professor jidi agarwal amran anshan par baith gaye hai
 They say that activities like mining in the Ganges and river rafting for recreational activities are degrading to the Ganges and should be banned
 wo ganga par banaae ja rahe baandhon ke bhi virodh main hai jo uski aviral dhara ko roak rahe hai
 Himanshu Thakkar is talking about Prof
 Aggarwal, Dinesh Mishra is saying and Nitish Kumar is saying
 tippaniyan Swami Gyanaswaroop Sanand, who was a professor of IIT Kanpur, has sat on a 38-day hunger strike earlier
 agast 2010 main unke anshan ke baad centre sarkaar ke teen mantriyon ke group ne bhagirathi nadi par ban rahe lohari nagpala project ko radd kar diya tha lekin ganga par banane vaale kai or baandh hai jo ab bhi uski aviralata main baadha ban rahe hai
 After watching prime time, only the government can take a picture and tweet where the drains are closed in the Ganges, where the treatment plant is cleaned of dirty water first and then falls in the Ganges
 ye sab kaam mantri ji paanch minute main twit kar bataa sakate hai
 2814 crore has been spent in building sewage related infrastructure, then it should be known and the outcome should be discussed
 agar aap sahi sawaal puuchhenge to sarkaar avashya bataaegi, kyonki wo bhi ganga se bahut pyaar karti he
 From Gangotri to Gangasagar, about 12000 MLD of sewage falls in the Ganges, but so far only 4000 MLD sewage treatment facility has been established, out of which only 1000 MLD sewage is still being treated
 chaar saal baad 12000 emeldi ganda pani main se sirf 1000 emeldi ganda pani saaf hokar gir rahaa he
 20,000 crore is to be spent in five years under Namami Gange
 is project ke tahat aath rajyon main 193 pariyojnaon ke liye 20,601 karod rupee kii manzuri di gai, lekin da hindu ke jaikab kosi kii 9 may 2018 ko prakashit ek report ke mutabik march 2018 tak is fund kaa sirf paanchvaan hissaa yani 4,254 karod rupye hi kharch ho paye the
 
 barsaat se ganga bhar jaaegi, uskaa sankat nahin dikhegaa magar banaras vaale apni ganga ko disbanr se hi dekh rahe hai
 Just they are not visible because they are looking at something else
 banaras ko puraa bharosa tha or aaj bhi he ki ganga uske paas rahegi hi magar usee banaras ko ganga pine kaa pani nahin de paa rahi he
 The condition is that on June 21, Water Advisory has been released in Benares

 He first shook the country on a serious issue like rape
 ye aisa dardanaak cese tha jab janata, sarkaar or kanoon banane vaale sabhi ro pade the
 After that a long series of claims and promises began
 kanoon kaa khauf badhaakar surat badalane kaa bharosa tak dilaayaa gaya
 But after that, only time has passed
 varna 16 disambar jaisi vaardaat punjab ke moga main phir saamne na aati
 The date is different, the place is different, the face is different but the story of violence is almost the same
 yani dilli kaa 16 disambar punjab ke moga main doharaaya to gaya lekin surat or kirdaar donon badal gaye
 Darkness was also on 16 December and darkness had also occurred during the 29 April incident
 16 disambar kii vaardaat main bas dilli main gum rahi thi or bas par savaar haivaan darindagi kii intehaa kar rahe the
 While the bus was on the way from one city to another city in the incident of April 29, the bus was also boarding this bus
 16 disambar kii kahani sun kar us vakt desh ubal padaa tha or 29 april kii is haivaaniyat kii ye aisi kahani he jise sunaakar rongte khadey ho jaaenge
 This story is no different than that
 lekin 16 disambar or 29 april kii vaardaat main bas gaur karne vaala fark usee bas kaa he jis par haivaaniyat savaar thi
 There were some predators in the presence of traveler, the rest was empty

 The mother riding in this bus, trying to play a game of humility in the bus with the daughter and son, but when the plans of the poor are not fulfilled, then once again you hear the pain at which they are off
 Will rise mushkil ho jayega aapke liye is baat par yakeen karnaa ki is duniya main aise bhi log hai, jo apni mouj masti kii khatir kab insaan se jaanavar ban jate hai, andaja bhi nahin mil paata or wo log milakar aisi kisi kii bhi izzat par haath daalane ko taiyaar ho jate hai
 Then even if she is a child
 sach kahen to puraa kissa aise sunaanaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 The words become dumb, tears of anger come in their eyes
 sochie unhone to kiya he
 To say this incident started in Moga area of punjab, where on Wednesday evening a girl rides her bus with her mother and brother
 bas par pehle se hi savaar kuch ladke uske saath chhedhkhani karne par utaaru ho jate hai
 And when the girl and her mother oppose those devils, they simply throw the 13-year-old girl and her mother down from the moving bus
 bas se girte hi ladki kii to maukey par maut ho jaati he jabaki ladki kii maa behad najuk haalat main jindagi or maut ke bich pahunch jaati hai
 This is the whole incident - 29 April 2015 at around 5 pm Moga Bhatinda Road - The bus of Orbit bus service running between Punjab Moga Bhatinda was going from Moga towards Bhatinda
 kot kapoora bypass ke paas teen savaariyaan bas kaa intjaar kar rahi thim
 a 38-year-old woman, along with her 13-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son, board this bus to reach the Gurusar Kothe
 shaam ke paanch baj chuke the or bas main savaariyaan bhi kaaphi kam thim
 So the three people sit comfortably in the bus and the bus moves towards Bhatinda
 bas jaise hi shahar kii had paar karke hive par aakar farrata bharna shuru karti he
 Suddenly, two boys in the bus act strangely, seeing all three including mother and daughter are badly hurt
 unhen kuch samaj hi nahin aata ki aakhir ye ho kya rahaa he? wo chaaron badmaash ladki ke saath chhedhkhani shuru kar dete hai or saath hi bas main baithi duusari savaariyon ko dhamkaane bhi lagate hai
 Meanwhile, the bus reaches near the toll block
 maa beti madad ke liye jor jor se cheekhnaa chillaanaa shuru kar detii hai
 But both the bus conductor and his partner tilt their head down
 taaki unki aawaaj ghut jaae
 After the toll, the driver continued to drive the bus for about five kilometers, and the traitor sitting in the back, misbehaved with the minor girl and her mother
 chaar rakshason ke bich buree tarah fansi wo ladki haath jod kar raham kii bheekh maangati he, lekin wo ladke nahin sunate ladki har chot or har ghinauni harakat ke saath tadap uthati he lekin unamem se kisi kaa bhi dil nahin pasija
 This process of molestation and screaming continued for a while and at a sudden turn, the driver opened the door of the bus opened with a hydraulic device and then the poor people pushed the 13-year-old innocent girl down the bus
 
 ladki ko bas se phenkane ke baad un shaitanon ne ladki kii maa ko bhi bas se phenk diya or phir thodi hi dur jaakar ladki ke bhai ko bas se utaar diya
 The girl died after falling from the bus
 jabaki uski maa buree tarah jakhmi ho gai
 Frightened as the girl's brother, he reaches close to his mother and sister
 raah chalate kisi shaks se madad lekar uske mobile se pehle apane gharavaalon ko or phir police ko vaardaat kii ittela detaa he

 bhale hi mulaayam singh yadav yah kah rahe ho ki samaajawaadee party kaa mukhyamantri jitkar aae hue vidhayak tay karenge, akhilesh yadav party or parivaar main mache ghamaasan ke bich akele apane raste par aage badhane kii thaan chuke hai
 The video which has been prepared for Akhilesh Yadav's election campaign clearly shows that Akhilesh Yadav wants to get out of the shadow of Mulayam Singh and seek votes from people only on the basis of his image and his work
 mumbai main taiyaar kiye gaye is shandaar video main sirf or sirnkhilesh yadavahi dikhte hai
 There is neither Mulayam Singh Yadav nor party anywhere
 shivpal yadav ke hone kaa to khayr sawaal hi nahin uthta
 The video begins with the face of Akhilesh Yadav on which it is written that he dedicates himself every day to the people of Uttar Pradesh
 videoki shuruyaat jis shot se hoti he usamen akhilesh yadav apane parivaar ke saath subah ghar par naashtaa kar rahe hai
 And then they come out - among the people in Uttar Pradesh
 yani puure pradesh ko vah apana vistrut parivaar hi maanate hai
 After that Akhilesh Yadav is seen meeting people and sitting in his office, meeting and giving instructions to the officials
 bana chuke hai alag pahachansandesh saaf he ki akhilesh yadav ab sirf mulaayam singh ke bete nahin hai balki wo apni alag pahchaan bana chuke hai
 The video also shows how Akhilesh Yadav's way of running the party and the government is completely different from Singh's time
 mulaayam singh ko angreji or computer ke virodh ke liye janaa jaataa tha
 He thought that these things would separate the party from the common people
 lekin akhilesh yadav apane shandaar daftar main aaraam se baithe hue dikhte hai
 He walks in a Mercedes and is no avoiding looking gorgeous
 inaki he bolti bandhvidio banane ke liye special camere se behtareen shot liye gaye hai, arial shots ke liye drone camaron kaa istemaal hua he or isaki editing ke liye mumbai kii agency ko jimmaa saunpa gaya
 This surprised Mulayam and the party's complete disappearance and his speaking is off
 cycle to banati hi heparty ke pravaktaa mohammad shahid bhi kehete hai kii aid film main kam se kam cycle to dikhni hi chahie thi
 The Samajwadi Party is called the village party and Mulayam Singh Yadav is called the earth son
 lekin akhilesh yadav kii film main chamakate-damakate shahar dekhte hai
 The point is clear that Akhilesh Yadav wants to cash in on his popularity among the youth who watch TV, use mobiles and have dreams about the future
 pichhali baar party ke bheetar virodh ke baavjood akhilesh yadav ne muft laptop dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi or is baar wo ek kadam aage badhkar sarkaar main aane par mobile dene kii baat kar rahe hai
 In the name of music, instead of a jingle or a song, a tune is used which gives a feeling of the atmosphere before going to war
 samaajawaadee party kii takat ke peeche yadav or muslim votbank ko mana jaataa he
 But there is nothing in the Ad film that reminds us of this identity of the party
 yani akhilesh yadav dharti putr mulaayam singh ke bete kahalaane ke bajaay expresve or metro ke jariye apana nayaa rasta khud bananaa chaahate hai
 The protagonist will always be a journalist, Ratan Mani Lal says that the entire film has been prepared in such a way that Akhilesh Yadav will always be seen as a hero even if he is a candidate of Samajwadi Party or even if the party is torn apart
 akhilesh yadav ko apni film main shuru or ant main bas nai party kaa naam bhar likhnaa hoga or har haalat main prachaar ke maamle main unki taiyaari puri hogi
 This is an attempt to portray Akhilesh Yadav as a cohesive family man amidst heated up in the message family
 film ke ant main akhilesh yadav apane bacchon ke bulaane par daftar se nikal kar unke saath khilne chale jate hai
 The message is clear that even if there is something wrong in the family, Akhilesh Yadav is not responsible for it
 hamaare jivan main khushiyon kaa aana-janaa grahon kii chaal par nirbhar karata he
 Apart from the fluctuations of the planets, the effect of the colors associated with them also affects our lives
 mangal grah kii baat karen to iskaa conection laal rang se mana jaataa he
 Characteristic of the color red of Mars, mainly two powers work in the world
 ye hai, rang or tarang
 All the planets, constellations and astrology work on the basis of color
 har grah kaa ek rang mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, Mangalco is associated with the color red
 yah rang mangal kii shaktiyon ko ghataata or badhaata he
 - Of the seven colors, red is the color with the highest intensity
 - yah rang sabase teji se failata he or vyakti ko prabhavit karata he
 - Red color is considered warm and royal color
 - laal rang ke andar urja or shakti hoti he
 - Red color gives courage, confidence and strength to a person
 - laal rang ke swabhaav or prabhaav ke kaaran isko mangal se joda jaataa he

 - If there is a side effect of red color, then accident can happen
 - iske galat asar se vyakti kaa pachan tantra bhi bigadataa he
 - Courage of red color decreases one's courage and confidence
 laal rang ghaatak helaal rangase aapke jivan main kai tarah ke ksht bhi aa sakate hai
 Therefore, it is very important to know who should use red color and who does not
 - jo krodhit swabhaav ke hai, unhen laal rang se bachanaa chahie
 People with acidity or stomach problems should avoid red color
 - man ashaant rahata ho to laal rang se dur rahen
 If rahu-mars or mars-saturn are related in the horoscope, avoid red color

 - Red color is harmful for Gemini and Virgo Ascendant
 laal rang kiske liye he phydemand- swabhaav se aalsee vyaktiyon ke liye laal rang acha he
 Red pain will be beneficial if there is pain in the body
 - sena, saahas yaa surgery ke kshetra main hon to laal rang laabh degaa
 - If Mars is weak in the horoscope then red color is beneficial
 - mangal se zyada laabh lenaa ho laal rang kaa prayog karen
 - Red color is most auspicious for Cancer and Leo Ascendant

 - Can get painted red on the walls
 - diwaar kaa thodaa hissaa laal rang se rangava sakate hai

 dhyaan rahe agar aapako shuruaati dinon main yah lagane lage ki jab se laal rang kaa istemaal kiya he, tab se nuksaan ho rahaa he to turant hi uskaa prayog band kar den
 BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha has clarified that because he publicly disagrees with his party, it does not mean that his and the party's paths are different
 ndtv
 Speaking to com, Sinha said that 'I have been with this party for the last 28 years, even then these people were not there
 ye log mere liye is tarah kii tippaniyan karke bas dhyaan batorte hai
 Sinha's reference was to BJP leader Mangal Pandey in Bihar who said that if Sinha had such a problem with PM Modi's decision of demonetisation, then why would he not join Congress
 sinha ne saaf kiya ki vimudrikaran ko lekar unhone jo aalochana kii thi use galat samajha gaya
 Sinha said, 'I salute PM Modi for this bold and sensible move but his team disappointed him
 ' sinha ne doharaaya ki 86 pratishat noton ko waapas liye jane kaa sabase zyada khamiyaaza auraton or gramin bharat ke logon ko bhugatna pad rahaa he
 Significantly, Shatrughan, a party MP from Patna Sahib seat, had questioned the survey on demonetisation two days ago
 shatrughna ne apane twit main naam liye bina pradhanmantri narendra modi par hamalaa bolaa tha or likhaa ki 'moorkhon kii duniya main jeena band karen
 These concocted stories and surveys have been done for vested interests
 ' tippaniyan ndtv
 com se baatcheet main shatrughna sinha ne kaha ki is vakt gramin bharat ko is gambhir sthiti se baahar nikaalane ke liye piem ko ek salaahkaar samiti banani chahie jisaki adhyakshata bijepi kii varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani karen or purv vittamantri yashavanth sinha ko iskaa sadsy banaaya jaae
 Let me tell you that both these leaders are not considered close to PM Modi
 sinha bhi adwani ke zyada kareeb hai
 Talking further, Sinha said that former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh should also be in this committee
 unki yah raay ek baar phir party ke alaakaman se alag hatakar sur lagaate hue dekhi ja sakati he
 Last week, Dr
 Manmohan Singh described demonetisation in Parliament as a 'huge failure of management' and a case of organized and legal loot
 is par vittamantri arun jetali ne palatwaar karte hue kaha tha ki 'yah niraashajanak he ki hamen un logon se is bare main sunanaa pad rahaa he, jinaki sarkaar ke dauraan sabase zyaada kaala dhan paidaa hua, sabase zyaada bhrashtachar or ghotaale saamne aae
 On this, Sinha once again went off the party line and said that the image of the former Prime Minister is very clear and no one can say that he has a hand in any scam
 unki baat ko gambhirtha se suna janaa chahie
 This was also said by bjp's alliance party Shiv Sena
 sinha ne saaf kiya ki vimudrikaran ko lekar unhone jo aalochana kii thi use galat samajha gaya
 Sinha said, 'I salute PM Modi for this bold and sensible move but his team disappointed him
 ' sinha ne doharaaya ki 86 pratishat noton ko waapas liye jane kaa sabase zyada khamiyaaza auraton or gramin bharat ke logon ko bhugatna pad rahaa he
 Significantly, Shatrughan, a party MP from Patna Sahib seat, had questioned the survey on demonetisation two days ago
 shatrughna ne apane twit main naam liye bina pradhanmantri narendra modi par hamalaa bolaa tha or likhaa ki 'moorkhon kii duniya main jeena band karen

 Let me tell you that both these leaders are not considered close to PM Modi
 sinha bhi adwani ke zyada kareeb hai
 Talking further, Sinha said that former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh should also be in this committee
 unki yah raay ek baar phir party ke alaakaman se alag hatakar sur lagaate hue dekhi ja sakati he
 Last week, Dr

 unki baat ko gambhirtha se suna janaa chahie
 This was also said by bjp's alliance party Shiv Sena

 bataa den ki ye donon hi netaa piem modi ke nazadiiki nahin maane jate
 Sinha is also closer to Advani
 sinha ne aage baat karte hue kaha ki is samiti main purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko bhi hona chahie

 On this, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley retaliated, saying that it is disappointing that we have to hear from those who generated the most black money during the government, the most corruption and scams

 But during the visit of Narmadaji we saw the reality with our own eyes
 3100 kilometre kii yatra ke dauraan 1800 kilometre kii yatra karne ke baad hamen sirf teen ped najar aae
 Digvijay Singh believes that when he raised the issue, he was sent the video as evidence
 jisamen dikhaaya gaya ki jahaan se wo nikal rahe the uske aage-aage ped lagaae ja rahe hai
 He said that there is widespread corruption in the state
 empi ke purv mukhyamantri kaa saaf kahana he ki shivaraj nenarmadake taton ko barbaad kar diya he

 According to Digvijay, in the Lok Sabha elections 2014, BJP got only 31 percent of the vote
 jise modi or shah badi jeet maanate hai
 But he does not know that 69 percent of the people did not vote for him, then how can you consider him a big victory

 Vicky has a clothes shop
 kahani main chanderi ke rahane vaale rudra (pankaj treepathi) ke aate hi bahut saare twist or terns aate hai

 isi dauraan viki koshraddha kapuurase ankhon hi ankhon main pyaar ho jaataa he
 The situation in the village gets further messed up when it is learned that a woman arrives there, who only disappears the men, leaving only their clothes

 Can see why: the story of the film is great
 screenple bhi acha likhaa gaya he, isaki vajah se har ek pal main dilchaspee bani rahati he
 The direction of the film is good and the location is amazing, due to which you feel scared in one moment and laugh at the second

 The twist of the film is also amazing
 pankaj treepathi ne bahut hi umdaa abhinay kiya he, wahirajkumaar raavane ek baar phir se bataa diya ki unhen acha actor kyon kaha jaataa he
 Rajkumar's work is amazing
 abhishek banerjee or aparshakti khurana ne bhi sahaj abhinay kiya he ,isi ke saath shraddha kapur kaa kaam bhi thik he
 The good thing about the film is its speed, which does not bore you
 kahani ke dauraan kuch ahm muddon kii taraf bhi dhyaan aakarshith karti he
 Amar Kaushik's direction is very good
 kamazor kadiyanrelis se pehle film ke geet hit nahin ho paae, iskaa khamiyaja shaayad mekars ko opening ke liye uthaanaa pad saktaa he, lekin kahani main dam he, jisaki vajah se verde of mouth se phayda milegaa

 Archaeological sources also reveal that thousands of villages, towns and settlements were inhabited on the banks of the Saraswati river

 Chander said yes, it could have been better

 There was an important hearing in the Supreme Court today regarding the case of loan defaulters
 court ne kaha ki in lone difoltaron ke naam sawarjanik karne se koi makasad hal nahin hoga
 We have to see where the problem lies and how to deal with it
 court ne centre sarkaar se teen hafte main report daakhil kar yah bataane ko kaha he ki uske paas lone recovery ke liye kya ection plan he
 The court said that the expert committee of the Center, which is considering it, will take the next step only after its report comes

 If we talk about defaulters below 500 crores, then it will be one lakh crores
 chif justise ties thakur ne sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha tha ki 500 karod or zyada ke lone difoltaron ke naam sawarjanik hon yaa nahin
 
 ye supreme court tay karegaa
 In fact, on February 16, the Supreme Court had asked for a list of loan defaulters of 500 crores and more and under this the RBI had filed a list in the Supreme Court
 sunwaayee ke dauraan yachikakarta ke vakil prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki ye list saarvajanik kii jaani chahie, jabaki RBI ne kaha ki list ke naam gupt rahane chahie, kyonki zyaadaatar difolter vilphul difolter nahin hai
 In such a case, if these names are public, then it will be against the rules, but the Chief Justice said that these people are not returning the money with the banks
 aise logon ke naam saarvajanik hote hai to isamen difoltaron ke alaava kisi par kya asar padegaa? In the last hearing, the Supreme Court had revealed that 57 thousand crores of liabilities are owed to 57 people who defaulted by taking loans of 500 crores and more from banks in the country
 agar 500 karod se kam ke difoltaron kii baat karenge to ye ek lakh karod hoga
 Chief Justice TS Thakur said during the hearing whether the names of loan defaulters of 500 crore and above should be public or not
 
 This Supreme Court will decide
 darasal, 16 farvari ko supreme court ne 500 karod or usase zyada ke lone difoltaron kii list maangi thi or isi ke tahat RBI ne supreme court main list daakhil kii thi
 During the hearing, counsel for the petitioner Prashant Bhushan said that the list should be made public, while the RBI said that the names of the list should remain secret, as most of the defaulters are not willful defaulters
 aise main ye naam public hote hai to niyamon ke khilaaf hoga, lekin chif justise ne kaha ki ye log bainkon kaa paisa lekar waapas nahin kar rahe
 If the names of such people are public, then what will be the impact on them apart from the defaulters? chif justise ties thakur ne sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha tha ki 500 karod or zyada ke lone difoltaron ke naam sawarjanik hon yaa nahin
 
 ye supreme court tay karegaa

 reyaan international skool se jab pradhyumna kii hatya kii khabar ai thi to puraa dilli or desh sakate main tha
 In a large school in the National Capital Region, such an incident shook the people, especially the parents
 media ne bhi is khabar ko haathon haath liya or maamle kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue ise kaaphi airtime diya gaya
 But the story of this massacre was becoming increasingly clear like counting of votes on evms
 hatya ke kuch hi der baad police ne hatyare ko pakad liya or uskaa ikbaalia bayaan logon ko suna diya gaya
 Bus conductor Ashoka was now a killer in the eyes of the people
 ek nrushans, vahashi, darinda jisakitulana haivaan se ho rahi thi
 On one side of the TV screen was the face of innocent Pradyuman, on the other side the weeping mother and thirdly this killer
 phir agle kuch dinon tak media main pradhyumna chaaya rahaa
 After the murder, parents feared if their children were safe from school buses to campus campuses and classrooms
 yah bhay hi media kaa bhaat ban gaya tha
 The rice was cooking
 pradhyumna par mahakvarej jari thi
 Ashoka's face and story were being told to the people by various cruel ornaments
 skulon main har garib, mailaa kuchaila kaamgaar, chaparasi, bas driver, conductor, rickshawvaale, sab andeh se dekhe ja rahe the
 Ashok's image was so bad that the lawyers refused to even defend his case
 kah diya gaya ki isapar muqadama chalaae bagaiyr faansee par chadha diya jaae
 On TV, the long episodes of Ashok's jealousy were going to cease the anger
 gaanvvaalon ne ashok kaa bahishkaar kar diya tha
 Evicted from caste society, Ashok is still behind the teachings
 kahani main twistor phir achaanak se notebandi kii pehali saalagirah ke din channelon par pradhyumna kii kahani phir zindaa ho uthi
 But now the villain of the story has changed
 wo ashok jise samaaj apni nazaron or dil main maar chukaa he, baar-baar usko maut ke ghat utaar chukaa he, ab is hatyakand kaa aaropee nahin he
 It is being told by the CBI that the killer is actually a 16 year old student studying in the 11th grade of the same school
 ab hatyare kii script ke shabd badal gaye hai
 She is a pornedict
 skool main porn clips dekhtaa he
 Is defiant ladkaa he
 Is insolent
 padhane main kamazor he
 Is a psychopath aisi kai kahaniyaan uske bare main sunne jaanane ko mil rahi hai
 Media cameras have now begun to sentence a new killer to death
 lekin is dauraan police se koi nahin puch rahaa he ki nae hatyare kii kahani main kitne hi anuttarit sawaalon par wo khamosh kyon he
 No one is demanding action against the police officers who forced Ashok to change his statement and forcibly confessional statement, nor is any case being filed against him accusing him of complicating the case
 jis baar council ne nyaayaadhikaran kii dahalij par pahunchane se pehle hi apana faisla suna diya tha or ashok kii pairvi karne se inkaar kar diya tha, unase ashok kaa parivaar puch rahaa he ki kya wo ab is ladke kii pairvi karne se bhi inkaar karenge or aise kitne maamalon main vakil apane farz or peshey se alag hote rahenge
 The biggest question is from the media that the media is constantly trying to pull Ashoka's skin, declaring him a criminal and demolishing his social-family existence every moment, is it at least once for Ashoka One should not apologize for his mistake playing such a game with an image
 bure kii paribhaasha main jis aasaani se ham kisi bhi garib or gande dikh rahe insaan ko feet kar dete hai, wo hamaari samaj ke ati-diwaaliyepan ke alaava or kya he
 An agency like CBI is working on Pradyuman's killer and murder
 lekin jin logon ne ashok kaa aparaadh sabit hone se pehle hi baar-baar uski hatya karne kii koshish kii he, unki javabdehi kya tay hogi yaa nahin
 And there is also a question about the society which is shocked to find a minor in their house suddenly killer
 hamaari shiksha vyavastha or samaaj ne pichley kuch varshon main hamase kai bachche chhine hai
 Children studying from primary and secondary school to AIIMS and IIT have committed suicides in the fear of examinations
 compatishan kii taiyaari kar rahe bachche, ames main pariksha kaa prashnptr angrezi main na likh paa rahe bachche, 99 pratishat ank laane kii daud main khud ko pichhadta paa rahe bachche, aise kitne hi bacchon ne aatmahatyaayein kii hai
 We are responsible for these suicides
 or agar yah baat sahi sabit hoti he ki 16 varsh ke is chaatr ne parikshaon ko taalane ke liye pradhyumna kii hatya kii thi to yah or bhi badi chintaa kaa prashn he
 Now the face of suicides is changing to murders
 parikshaon ke khauf se aatmahatya kar rahe bachche agar parikshaayen taalane ke liye hatyaein karne lag jaaen to yah kisi samaaj main samvedanheenata kaa charam or patan kii paraakaashtha kaa sanket he
 Listen to this sound
 kyonki is hatya main ham aap bhi shaamil hai

 tippaniyan The Anganwadi workers were instructed to bathe well and prepare all the people of the township
 kisi ke sharir yaa kapadon se badboo na aae, isliye sabhi par saint chhidaka jaae
 Under the orders of the top officials, the Anganwadi workers had made complete preparations, but CM Yogi Adityanath did not reach this settlement of Dalits
 yah baat media or soshal media main chaa gai kyonki daliton kii is basti main rahane vaale logon ke paas pahanane ko paryaapt kapade tak nahin hai
 In such a situation, how did his clothes become so clean
 unke paas nahaane kaa sabun kahaan se aa gaya? Even before the Chief Minister arrived here, big officers of UP reached the Dalit colony

 In such a situation, how did his clothes become so clean
 unke paas nahaane kaa sabun kahaan se aa gaya? Janata dal-united (JDU) will oppose the removal of Section 370, but by staying in the NDA
 patna main yojit jediu rashtriya kaaryakaarani kii baithak main spasht taur par kaha gaya ki bihar main endie bijepi ke saath milakar mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke netritv main chunaav ladegi
 There is no confusion anywhere
 jediu lagaataar kahati rahi he ki wo bijepi ke saath he, lekin uske mukhya muddon kaa wo virdohi karti he jisamen dhara 370 hataane 35 e samaan aachaar samhita or ram mandir kaa maamla pramukh he
 The JDU has been opposing the NDA on these four subjects
 chunaav ke aakhir charan ke pehle tak mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kaha tha ki in muddon par party koi samjhauta nahin karegi
 The party believes that the court that will decide on the issue of construction of Ram temple will consider it
 bijepi ke netaa mandir nirmaan ko lekar baar-baar bayaanbaji karte rahete hai
 The party's national general secretary KC Tyagi said that till now RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat also talks about the court
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne mana he ki court kaa jo faisla hoga yaa phir aapasi sahmati se hi ayodhya main ramamandir kaa nirmaan hoga
 So the difference between BJP and JDU on this issue is now nil

 There has been a big difference in opinion between JDU and BJP, but even if the government of absolute majority removes Section 370, JDU will oppose it by staying in NDA
 aise kai mudde hai jisamen party ne aisa stad liya he
 On the issue of triple talaq, the JDU voted against the law
 isse sthitiyaan saaf ho gayi ki bihar main bijepi or jediu kaa gathbandhan jari rahegaa or donon 2020 kaa chunaav mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke netritv main ladenge
 However, the JDU decided on Sunday that it would not be part of the bjp-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) outside Bihar

 At the same time, the party said that it will not compromise on Article 370 in Kashmir
 vah endie main rahete hue bhi iskaa virodh karegaa
 In the press conference, party leader KC Tyagi said that we will contest the 2020 assembly elections under the leadership of Nitish Kumar with the NDA
 dilli, haryana, jharkhand or jammu kashmir main puri majbootee ke saath chunaav ladenge
 On the issue of joining the central government, he said that no name was given by the JDU, even on the date of swearing in on the 30th, but Nitish Kumar refused, no name was given
 ravivaar ko bhi unhone kaha ki centre sarkaar main hissaa nahin hoga, halki baahar se samarthan jari rahegaa
 KC Tyagi said that the party would not compromise on Article 370
 samaan naagarik samhita par baat kii jaani chahie
 However, this decision is seen as the Bihar Chief Minister's reply to the BJP after he opted to stay out of the JDU from the new government at the Center last month

 ' netaji se judi filon ko saarvajanik karne ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki in filon main kya he, ise dekhne ko vah icchhuk hai
 But more important than this is to discuss his life and his thinking, his work and his vision, not how he died, let us keep discussing it
 sen ne kaha, 'netaji kii samanta or nyaay ko lekar jo soch thi, vah aaj bhi anukaraniya he
 Unfortunately, the governments of independent India have done little to advance their thinking, whereas the present government is doing less than them
