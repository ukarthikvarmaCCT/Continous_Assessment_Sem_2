 Shoppers in Patna market will no longer be able to weigh goods in plastic bags and give them to customers

 isliye ham log pehle se hi taiyaari kar lee he
 The general public is also happy with this decision of the government
 halaki, ab bazaar se saamaan laane ke liye jhola ghar se lekar aana hoga
 People have some concern about this, but in view of the environmental damage caused by plastic, there is no shortage of those who justify this decision of the government
 patna ke rajesh kumaar kehete hai ki ek jute kaa bag ham log ghar se nikalne samay saath main rakhana shuru kar die hai
 The government has a good initiative
 ham log sarkaar kaa saath denge
 Fine will not come

 We have already started keeping jute bags
 patna kii hi rachana raaj kahati hai ki plastic par bain pichley 2 maheene se laga hua he

 haalanki, vaayu sena kaa kahana he ki unke paas satellite photo hai jo spasht rup se ingit karte hai ki in imaaraton par hamalaa kiya gaya he
 Satellite imagery experts said in earlier reports that the largest structure at the Balakot Camp had visible bomb attack marks

" ek unnat fus kaa vikalp hota he jo floron kii ginati bhi kar saktaa he
 In the case of Balakot, at least one Spice 2000 smart bomb was set to penetrate the two-story building before the explosion
 yah abhi bhi spasht nahin he ki sarkaar balakot hamale kii satellite imegen jari karegi yaa uskaa khatm kiye gaye aatankwaadiyon kii sankhya par or saboot dene kaa iraadaa he
 However, it seems clear that the photos do not show any major bang
 haalanki, balakot main aatanki thikaane ke bheetar chaynit lakshyon par sateek hamale ke spasht saboot hai

 bihar ke mujffarpur jile main acute inseflitis syndrome (AES) ke chalate saikadon bachche maare gaye
 Lychee was being reported responsible for the deaths of the children
 lichi kaa katoraa kahe jane vaale mujffarpur main teen hafte se lichi par bavaal chhidaa hua he
 Lychee sales plummeted across the country
 lekin, desh ke bade vaigyanik ne is baat se inkaar kar diya he ki lichi se inseflitis hota he
 In an interview to India Today, the Director of the National Research Center, the institute that researches litchi, is Dr
 vishalnath ne kaha ki lichi or inseflitis ke bich koi sambandh nahin he
 Come
 
 
 jaanate hai ki dow
 Vishalnath broke all the confusions for lychee and encephalitis
 1
 It is believed that encephalitis is happening in Bihar due to natural toxic present in lychee
 usase bachche mar rahe hai
 Some research and studies have also reported a relationship between malnutrition and natural toxicity of litchi
 kya aap is baat se sahamat hai?lichi kaa inseflitis se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 The portion of litchi that we eat does not contain any natural toxic
 ye durbhagyapurna he ki logon ko lichi ke bare main galat jaankaree di gai he
 Litchi from Muzaffarpur also goes to Delhi and Mumbai
 desh ke anya hisson main bhi bheja jaataa he
 In such a situation, encephalitis should have spread throughout the country
 lekin aisa nahin hua
 Lychee is a very nutritious fruit
 isamen vitamin-bi, calcium, aayran, potacium, phosphorus or anya minerals hote hai
 It has been 11 years at the research center in Muzaffarpur, but till date i have not seen any side effects of lychee
 2
 Some experts suggested that lychee does not cause encephalitis, but children from poor families go to sleep eating litchi on an empty stomach
 kya khaali pet lichi khaakar sone se AES hota he?lichi, aam, amaruud jaise kai fal prakritik taur par amleey hote hai
 It is advised not to eat acidic fruits on an empty stomach
 isse kuch dikkatein ho sakati hai lekin isse kisi kii maut nahin ho sakati
 Litchi is grown on 1 lakh hectares of land all over the country
 mujffarpur main sirf iskaa dasvaan hissaa (8000 se 10 hajaar hectare) hi paidaa hota he
 If children below the age of 10 are getting encephalitis due to litchi, then it should have spread to children in other parts of the country
 isse garib hi kyon amir pariwaron ke bachche bhi biimaar hote
 3
 indian academy of pediatrix kii study main saamne aayaa ki bacchon ne din main lichi khai thi or raat main khaanaa nahin khaaya
 hypoglycein-a, a natural toxin present in litchi, reduced children's blood sugar overnight, leading to hypoglycaemia
 dekha gaya ki bachche agali subah tak biimaar pad gaye
 Do you agree with this? The methyl cyclopropyl glycine (MPCG) found in lychee seeds is converted into amine acid
 lekin yah lichi ke pulp (guda) main nahin paaya jaataa
 Therefore, the question arises as to why someone would eat litchi seeds and why would they eat such an amount
 lichi khaane ke baad khun main sugar kii kami ho hi nahin sakati, kyonki lichi main paryaapt maatra main sugar hota he
 Children suffering from AES were coming to SKMCH since January
 jabaki, us samay to lichi kii paidaavaar hi nahin hoti
 4
 rajya ke krishi mantri prem kumaar ne mujffarpur main lichi or inseflitis ke sambandhon kii jaanch karne ke aadesh die hai
 Do you believe that the government and doctors are not able to find the exact cause of deaths due to encephalitis, hence linking the case to litchi? We need to understand the eating habits, nutritional levels, environmental condition and hygiene of the victims
 Detailed study will have to be done
 kuposhan bada kaaran ho saktaa he
 Because of this, the immunity of children becomes weak
 abhi hamen beemaari kaa kaaran khojane main jutana chahie
 We are ready to help the government fully
 lekin ham chaahate hai ki sarkaar lichi ke alaava anya kaarnon par bhi focus kare
 While the incidents of stone pelting have been very low in the Kashmir Valley this year, CRPF personnel will use non-lethal plastic bullets used in AK-47 to prevent stone pelting in the coming times

e
 AK 47
 pehle ham log jo narmal arms lekar chalate the, usase les leethal goli fire nahin hoti thi par ab hamaare saath jo arms hai usamen iskaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 These are Les Lethal bullets and cannot be used during stone pelting
 isko diardio kii taraf se shodh karke banaaya gaya he or is tarah kii goli kaa istemaal karne ke peeche kaa concept yah he ki jawan ko agar lau and order kii sichuation ko sanbhaalanaa he to vah isi hathiyaar se les leethal goli kaa istemaal kar saktaa he
 21000 bullets of this method have been sent to Jammu and Kashmir, which will be used to control stone pelting and crowd control
 'aapako bataa den ki jaise hi plastic kii goliyaan eke-47 bandook se niklegi, ve kai tukdon main bat jaaengi or vahi tukde updraviyon or patharbaajon ke sharir ke hisson main lagenge, jisase uski jaan ko khatra nahin hoga, lekin use ruknaa padegaa
 21,000 bullets were sent to Kashmir
 Currently, 21000 such plastic bullets have been sent to Kashmir
 danga niyantran ke kaary mensurakshabalon ne pichley teen saalon main ise viksit karne kaa kaam shuru kiya tha jo ki is saal puraa ho chukaa he or pehali baar jammu kashmir main eke-47 main plastic kii goliyon kaa istemaal hoga

 India, who set a challenging target of 303 runs against South Africa with a vigorous innings from the troubleshooter VVS Laxman, kept their hopes of victory in the second Test cricket match at the turning point by taking three crucial wickets here
 lakshmana keval chaar ran se shatak se chook gayi lekin 171 gend par 12 chaukon kii madad se banaaye gayi unke 96 ran kii badaulat bharat apni duusari pari main 228 ran tak pahunchane main safal rahaa
 South Africa got off to a positive start at Kingsmead ground to reach the third highest target but Indian bowlers led by s Sreesanth took three wickets for 19 runs to send them to the backfoot
 lagaataar tisare din kharaab roshni ke kaaran jab khel kaaphi pehle samaapt karnaa padaa tab dakshin africa ne teen wicket par 111 ran banaaye the
 He still needs 192 runs to win
 uskaa puraa daaromadar anbhavi jaak kallis (naabad 12) or abi divilliars (naabad 17) par tikaa he
 In the morning, if Laxman took over the task of crossing the Naiya, in the evening, Sreesanth gave wings to Indian hopes by dismissing dangerous batsmen like captain Graeme Smith (37) and Hashim Amla (16)
 harbhajan singh ne duusare salaami ballebaaj elviro petersan (26) ko out kiya
 India got some disappointment from Zaheer as he was not getting swing in the second innings
 bharat ko chaay ke baad jald hi petersan kaa wicket bhi mil gaya jinhone harbhajan kii atirikt oochaal lekar leg stump kii taraf turn leti gend ko modane ke prayaas main pujaara ko aasaan kaich diya
 Sreesanth tasted the dangerous Amla playing a bad shot in the next over, taking the score to 82 for three
 amala ne unki aaf stump kii baahar jaati gend cat kerani chaahi lekin vah unke balle kaa kinaaraa lekar dhoni ke paas chali gayi
 Kallis and de Villiers, however, faced the bowlers with ease after that for the next ten overs
 divilliars ne is bich harbhajan kii gend par chakka bhi jadaa
 Earlier the Indian innings revolved around Laxman
 unhone dhoni (21) ke saath chathe wicket ke liye 48 ran or jahir (27) ke saath vah aathven wicket ke liye 70 ran kii do mahatvapurn saajhedaariyaan kii
 For South Africa, Dale Steyn and Lonwabo Tsotsobe took three wickets each
 subah bharat ne chaar wicket par 92 ran se aage khelnaa shuru kiya lekin cheteshwar pujaara (10) apane somvaar ke score main bina koi ran jode pavilion laut gayi
 He could not play Morne Morkel's extra bounce ball properly and hit him on the wickets
 sotsobe ne 42wein over main dhoni ko out karke yah saajhedaari todi
 His outswinger took the edge of the bat of the Indian captain and got into the gloves of Mark Boucher
 harbhajan bhi adhik der tak nahin tik paye or morkal ne 45wein over kii pehali gend par hi unhen slip main kallis ke haathon kaich kara diya
 Laxman held one end and completed his 49th half-century with two runs off Morkel in the 47th over
 is bich jahir ne bhi kuch achche shaat lagaaye jinamein lunch se thik pehle sotsobe par lagaaye gayi lagaataar do chauke bhi shaamil hai
 Soon after lunch, India lost the wicket of Zaheer, who caught de Villiers in the second slip off spinner Paul Harris's turn-taking ball
 ishanth sharma ne 16 gend kaa saamana karne ke baad kallis kii short pich gend par farward short leg main amala ko kaich kaa abhyaas karaayaa
 At such a time, Laxman had no option but to score runs fast so that he could complete his century
 unhone haris kii gend sweep karke fine leg boundry par bheji lekin sten kii uthati gend par cat karne ke prayaas main vah dhilaa shaat khel gayi
 The ball then only took the edge of the bat and went straight into the gloves of wicketkeeper Mark Boucher
 timen is prakaar hai:bharat:virendra sahvaag, murali vijay, rahul dravid, sachin tendulkar, vivies lakshmana, cheteshwar pujaara, mahendra singh dhoni, harbhajan singh, eshanth sharma, es shrishant, jahir khan

 After forgetting all the grievances with BSP chief Mayawati, SP president Akhilesh Yadav will campaign for Mukhtar Ansari's brother Afzal Ansari in Ghazipur today
 vahiin bahubali mukhtaar ansaari, jiske sapa main aane par akhilesh bhadak gaye the or chachaa shivpal yadav se than gai thi
 The merger of Mukhtar's party Qaumi Ekta Dal with SP was canceled due to Akhilesh's opposition
 baat june, 2016 kii he, jab shivpal yadav ne mulaayam singh yadav kii sahmati se mukhtaar ansaari kii party kaumi ekta dal kaa sapa main vilay kaa elaan kiya tha
 The announcement made the then chief minister and SP state president Akhilesh Yadav angry
 akhilesh ne iskaa khulkar virodh kiya or is maamle main sakriy bhoomika nibhaane vaale mantri balram yadav ko cabinet se barkhaast kar diya gaya tha
 The entry of Ansari brothers into SP was the foundation of the struggle in the Samajwadi clan
 mulaayam ke dakhal ke baad sapa sansadeey board ne ansaari kii party ke vilay ke prastaav ko radd kar diya or balram yadav kii dobaaraa mantrimandal main vaapasi hui
 Then the Ansari brothers entered the SP, Akhilesh again reversed the decision; a few days later, with the Ansari brothers, Akhilesh Yadav and Shivpal got involved again
 disambar main phir mulaayam kii sahmati par shivpal ne na keval kaumi ekta dal kaa sapa main vilay karaayaa balki ansaari bandhuon ko tikat dene kaa bhi elaan kar diya
 After this, the merger of the Kaumi Ekta Dal was canceled as soon as Akhilesh Yadav came to command the party
 iske saath hi ansaari bandhuon kii prastaavit siton se duusare ummidavaar ghoshit kar die
 The decision of Akhilesh, Afzal Ansari, brother of Mukhtar Ansari, said that Akhilesh, who insulted us for his branding, has hijacked the SP
 purvanchal main hamaari party sapa ko uski aukaat dikhaa degi
 After this, the Ansari brothers merged their party, the Qaumi Ekta Dal, into the BSP
 2017 kaa vidhansabha chunaav basapa ke tikat par ansaari bandhu lade the
 However, only Mukhtar Ansari managed to win from Mau Sadar

 pehle sirf mayawati kii hi honi thi raligajipur main beete kai dinon se charchaa thi ki akhilesh yadav, afjaal ansaari ke liye prachaar nahin karenge
 Due to this, SP officials and workers were also confused
 aaj yani 13 may ko basapa pramukh mayawati kii raily jarur prastaavit thi, lekin akhilesh yadav ke aane kaa koi kaarykram pehle se tay nahin tha
 Akhilesh Yadav will himself contest today to remove the confusion of SP workers

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to the Election News Special Newsletter kendriya soochna ayog ne kendriya grih mantralay ko nirdesh diya he ki mahatma gandhi kii hatya ke sambandh main dilli police dwaara darj FIR or aarope patr ko saarvajanik kiya jaae
 The directive of the transparency panel came at the request of Hemant Panda, a resident of Bolangir district in Odisha
 pandas ne grih mantralay main saat sutreey aavedan dekarbapu kii hatyaki praathmiki, aaropapatr sahit anya jaankaree maangi he, jisamen yah bhi shaamil he ki kya kanoon ke anusaar baapu kii parthiv deh kaa postmortem kiya gaya tha
 The Ministry has sent this application to the Director of Archives of India, Darshan Samiti and Gandhi Smriti
 gandhi smriti ko pehle birla house kaha jaataa tha, jahaan baapu ne aakhri din bitaye the or jahaan unki hatya kii gai thi
 Not done by the wishes of the family, the post-mortem National Archives has informed Panda that he can come to his office to get the necessary information kept under the provisions of Public Records Act 1993 and Public Record Rules 1997
 gandhi smriti or darshan samiti ne unhen suchit kiya he ki baapu ke parivaar waalon kii ichha ke mutabik postmortem nahin kiya gaya tha
 Gandhi Smriti and Darshan Samiti also told Panda that they had no information about the FIR and charge sheet filed by Delhi Police in connection with the murder of Mahatma Gandhi on 30 January 1948
 jawaab main gandhi smriti ne kaha he ki tughlaq road police thane ne hatya ke baad praathmiki darj kii or jaanch kii thi

 Sabharwal said that if no information is available in the Ministry of Home Affairs or Tughlaq Road Police Station, the CPIO of the Ministry will give a reply in writing to Panda
 unhone bataaya ki ayog ke uparokt adeshon kaa paalan grih mantralay ke sipiio ko aadesh milane ke 30 din ke bheetar karnaa he
 Sabharwal also stated that Panda is allowed to avail the facility of offering to view their records in the National Archives

 -input bhashaa se El Chapo, one of the world's largest drug dealers, was also a serial rapist
 usne police jaanch main kai chaunkaane vaale khulaase kiye he
 Police have come to know that he raped several girls during the absconding
 darasal wo ladakiyon ko vitamin bataata he
 She says that her relationship with girls increases her lifespan
 philhal drugs mafia jokin gajaman el chapo ke khilaaf kai maamalon main trial chal rahe hai
 During this, new revelations are being made about him
 uski kaali karatuuton ke bare main jaanakar jaanch adhikari bhi hairaan hai
 Recently, it has been revealed that while Joaquin Gajman was running away from the police and security agencies, he had also made many girls a victim of their lust
 wo un ladakiyon ko apane liye 'vitamin' bataata tha
 According to him, his life and health were better by raping
 court main ailex sifuentis naamak ek gavaah ne bataaya ki commered maaria naam kii ek mahila jokin gajaman se lagaataar baat karti thi
 She used to send pictures of young girls to El Chapo
 el chapo unamem se ladakiyon ko chunata tha or pahadiyon par maujuud apane khufia thikaane par unhen bulaata tha
 He used to pay lakhs of rupees for this work
 ye gavaah el chapo ke saath tha
 As he hid in the hills of California to escape from the Mexico Police
 ailex ke anusaar jokin gajaman el chapo jawan ladakiyon ko apana vitamin kahata tha
 He used to say that he gets a life from raping those girls
 ailex sifuentis ne adaalat main apana gunaah kubul karte hue bataaya ki usne bhi kai baar naaballig ladakiyon ke saath sex kiya tha
 According to police, Sifuentis had been with El Chapo for about a year
 uski gavaahi par el chapo ke vakil nakaar rahe hai
 Many such things have come out about El Chapo in the US jail
 jise jaanakar har koi hairaan he
 Significantly, the head of an organization called the Sinaloa Cartel, Joaquin Gazeman El Chapo, was extradited from Mexico to the US in 2017
 us par drugs kii taskari ke sangeen aarope hai
 Currently, many cases are going on in the US against him
 is silsile main adhikari lagaataar usase poochtacha kar rahe hai
 The results of the Jammu and Kashmir assembly elections are almost out
 pradesh membhartiya janata party badhat to hasil kii he, lekin wo mishan 44 ke paas nahi panhuch saki
 Jammu is the main reason for bjp's growth
 is hindu bahul ilaake se hi party ko sari siten mil rahi hai
 That is, polarization has occurred
 haalankibijepine badi sankhya main muslim ummidavaar bhi maidan main utaare the
 But Muslim voters, opposed to the National Conference and Omar Abdullah, voted for the PDP
 nateeja, ghati main ek bhi camel nahin khil sakaa
 The Congress was marginalized
 jammu-kashmir main bijepi ne 87 siton main se 32 par muslim ummidavaaron ko tikat diya tha
 BJP fielded 25 candidates in Kashmir Valley, 5 in Jammu region and 1 Muslim candidate in Ladakh
 party ne 4 kashmiri panditon or 1 sikh ummidavaar ko bhi kashmir ghati se tikat diya
 3 Buddhist candidates were also played in Ladakh
 lekin bijepi kaa sara jor jammu par hi tha
 Perhaps its strategists realized that gaining the trust of the Muslim voters of the state would not be easy
 haalanki loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko muslim vot mili the
 But in the assembly elections, Muslims distanced themselves from the BJP
 ghati main bijepi is baat se khush ho sakati he ki jahaan unka vajood hi nahin tha vahaan unke khate main chand vot to aaye hai
 However, it has made good inroads in Muslim dominated areas of Jammu region
 chenab ghati, yahaan tak ki kishtwar main bhi bijepi ko badhat mili he
 If we look at the election history of the state in the last decade, this election has proved to be better for the BJP
 2002 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ko soobe main keval 1 seat hasil hui thi
 Whereas in the 2008 assembly elections, BJP had 11 assembly seats in its account
 virdohi kah rahe hai ki muslim maton ke naa milane se bijepi kaa mishan kashmir puraa nahin ho sakaa
 The big reason for this has also been all the disputed statements that Modi's ministers and BJP leaders gave time and time again
 jaankaar kehete hai ki bhale hi modi khud is tarah ke bayanon se dur rahe hon lekin unki party ke logon ne unmaad se bhare bayaan dene main koi kor-kasar nahin chodi
 Whether it was Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti or Sakshi Maharaj or Giriraj Singh, everyone kept making more than one statement
 jo bhi kaha jaye yadi ghati main in bayanon se bijepi ko nuksaan hua he to jammu main phayda bhi to mila he
 Now BJP is emerging as the second largest party in the state but how much will it contribute to form the government? It is too early to say rajya kii janata ne neshnal conference or congress ko nakaar diya he
 PDP got an edge but it is not in a condition to form a government without support
 ab dekhne vaali baat ye hogi ki ab pidipi ke saath satta main saajhedaari koun karegaa? Defying all claims of the safety of passengers of the Indian Railways, criminals looted a running train in broad daylight

 tendulkar or vivies lakshmana ko madhya pradesh cricket sangh (empisie) ke sadsy sanjeev gupta dwaara daayar kii gai shikaayat par notice bheja gaya tha
 According to the complaint, Laxman and Tendulkar played dual roles as 'assistant members' of the IPL franchise teams, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Mumbai Indians respectively, and members of the bcci's Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC), which were reported to be a case of alleged conflict of interest
 
 apane jawaab main tendulkar ne likhaa, ‘sabase pehle, notice praptakarta (tendulkar) sabhi shikayaton ko khaarij karata he (bayanon ko chhodkar jo vishesh rup se yahaan sweekaar kiye jate hai)
 The copy of his reply is also with PTI stating, 'the recipient of the notice (tendulkar) has not availed any special financial benefit / benefit in the ability to team' Icon 'from the Mumbai Indians IPL franchise since his retirement Is also not employed for the franchise in the role
 ’antarrashtriya cricket main sabase zyada ran banane vaale is khilaadi ne kaha he ki vah kisi bhi pad par kabiz nahin hai, na hi unhone koi nirnay liya he (team ke khilaadiyon ke chayan sahit), jo frenchiji ke shashan yaa prabandhan ke antargat aata he

 The opportunity was to organize 'agenda Aaj Tak' and in its 'mission Kashmir' session on Friday, Aaj Tak's anchor Punya Prasoon Vajpayee questioned Farooq Abdullah whether he considered himself an Indian? Farooq said that yes, i am an Indian
 lekin phir achaanak hi wo vaajapeyi par bifer pade
 He raised his voice and said- You doubt it
 aapako ye adhikaar kisne diya he, ki aap ye sawaal mujhase puuchhen
 How dare you? Farooq did not stop here
 wo bole ki aap biimaar hai
 It has sat in your mind like a disease
 aapako kisi manochikitsak ko dikhaane kii jarurat he
 The only way that you can take it from your heart is that we are not Hindustani
 faruk bole ki is sawaal kii vajah shaq he or iskaa koi ilaaj nahin
 He said that big quacks came into this world, but who did not suspect the bullet
 yah sawaal kashmiri se hi kyumpharukkahate hai ki hindustani hone kaa sawaal kisi or bhartiya se kyon nahin poocha jaataa
 Why don't you ever ask this question to someone else who is not from Kashmir and why this question is asked only to Kashmiris
 wo bataate hai ki jis din yah andeh logon ke dilon se nikal jayega, sthitiyaan thik hone lagengi
 He said how many sacrifices the Kashmiris have made for the country
 lekin yah afsos kii baat he ki aapas kii ladaai or shaq karne kii aadat se ham ubar nahin paa rahe hai

 yah prayog uttar pradesh ke barabanki jile se payalat project ke rup main shuru kiya jayega
 The decision in this case has not been taken at the governance level, rather the captain of Barabanki will give 1 day leave to the police personnel in his district to see if the work of the department can run properly by giving 1 day leave
 agar isamen safalataa milti he to yah prayog kai or jilon main bhi lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 Actually Uttar Pradesh Police employees work 7 days a week and no provision of leave has been made
 is sab ke chalate lagaataar police karmchaaree sangh kii taraf se or saath hi saath adhikariyon kii taraf se bhi chuttee die jane kii maang hoti rahi he
 However, whenever there is peace in the area or there is no big event in the police department, he unknowingly takes a chance to do his personal work once a week
 uttar pradesh police ke mutabik agar yah vyavastha puri tarah se lagu hoti he to ab unhen aadhikarik rup se hafte main ek din chuttee milane kaa niyam banaaya jayega
 The police department has the responsibility of organizing and law and order 24 hours and seven days a week, so it is not possible to discharge them
 lekin ab karmchaariyon kii maang or jarurat ke chalate is tarah kii saptaah main 1 din kii chuttee die jane kaa prayog kiya ja rahaa he

 Hitting out at bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that the BJP has given birth to a new avatar which is insulting its elders
 jahanabad loksabhaa seat se jediu ummidavaar or builder anil sharma ke paksh main prachaar karte hue modi par kataaksh karte hue nitish ne kaha ki vah bijepi khatm ho gayi jiske netaa atal bihari vaajapeyi the
 Now a new avatar of BJP has happened and such a new avatar has been done in which all the big leaders of BJP have been sidelined
 nitish kaa ishaara bijepi ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani, murali manohar joshi, jaswant singh, lalamuni choube or chandramohan raay kii ore tha
 He said, 'advani wanted to fight but was told to be imprisoned in the cage of Gandhinagar
 ’ nitish ne kaha ki assi ke dashak main naaraa lagaaya jaataa tha ki bijepi ke teen dharohar atal, adwani or murali manohar
 This third heritage Joshi had to leave Varanasi
 ‘bujurgon ko darkinar kar rahi he bijepi’nitish ne kaha ki varsh 1999 george furnandis ke saath milakar endie kaa nunatam saajha kaarykram taiyaar karne vaale or atal sarkaar main videsh, raksha evam vittamantri rahe jaswant singh ko rajasthan main apane grih sansadeey kshetra se tikat nahin diya gaya
 He said that Lalmuni Choubey cut a ticket from Buxar in Bihar and has come to the newspaper about the old leader Chandramohan Roy that he too has resigned from all the posts of BJP
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki us party ke nae avatar ne bijepi par jis prakaar se kabja kiya usee tarah se vah puunjipatiyon kii madad se desh par kabja karnaa chaahate hai
 Referring to Modi's election rallies, he said how much is being spent on elections
 ek-ek raily par karodon rupee kharch kiye ja rahe hai
 Where is that money coming from? kiskaa paisa he
 Nitish said that the capitalist who is investing money is investing and investing in the politics of the country
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki ab tak jo puunjipati the ve madad karte the par ab ek mukhauta (narendra modi) saamne rakhkar desh par raaj karnaa chaahate hai
 So they are investing money
 beshumaar daulat kaa istemaal ho rahaa he
 a party that is spending so much during elections
 ham logon ne jabase hosh sambhala he kisi bhi party se chunaav par itnaa kharch nahin kiya he
 His reference was towards BJP
 ‘ahamkaari nahin swabhimani hum’nitish ne kaha ki jo paisa de rahaa he vah chunaav ke baad uski vasuuli karegaa
 Therefore, we want to warn the younger generation that they (modi) should not get into the matter of development
 unhone kaha ki bijepi gujarat ke vikaas model ko jis prakaar se mahimamandit kar rahi he par vahaan badi puunji kaa nivesh hone par bhi rojgaar ke avasar kam hue
 Nitish said that he cannot tolerate politics of communalism and gain power by provoking sentiments
 isliye kursi kii parvaah kiye bina apane siddhant ke kaaran usase naata todaa
 He said that today BJP is being insulted by the BJP for talking about the development of Bihar and is being called arrogant
 ham ahamkaari nahin ho sakate, swabhimani hai
 We are proud to be Hindustani and Bihari
 rojgaar nahin to vikaas kaa matlab kya?nitish kumaar ne kaha ki vah bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dilaane kii ladaai lard rahe par kuch log kursi (narendra modi ke piem banane) kii ladaai lard rahe hai or gujarat ke vikaas ke model kii baat kar rahe hai
 He said that the condition of tribals in Gujarat improved and they got employment
 aankade bataate hai pehle gujarat main 80 pratishat adivasee khet par nirbhar the or aaj vahaan itnaa udyog lagane par kal-kaarkaanon main kaam milane se unki kheti par nirbharta ghatane ke bajaae ab yah badhkar 85 pratishat ho gayi he
 Nitish said that capital is being invested in Gujarat, but there are no employment opportunities in such a situation, so what is the meaning of that development
 unhone kaha ki 2007 ke aankade ke mutabik gujarat main do lakh majdoor kapaas kii kheti main kaam karte the or usamen se ek tihaai bal majdoor hai
 How will you get electricity if you seal the lantern? Nitish said that RJD supremo attacked Lalu Prasad and said that they are moving around by burning lanterns during the day
 yaad rakhiyegaa jis din laalaten din main jalane lagegi (argedy ke paksh main matdaan kiya) na to bijli pahonchegi or na hi samaaj main aman-chaiyn rahegaa
 He lashed out at LJP supremo Ram Vilas Paswan and RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, saying that he has no greed nor to pursue his brother or any other family but the concern of 100 million people of Bihar
 kisi ko bete kii chintaa to kisi ko beti kii chintaa or bibi kii chintaa tathaa saale (sadhu yadav) kii chintaa bhale hi vah kaam nahin aayaa
 Nitish, referring to the Naxalite-affected Jehanabad and its estranged Arwal district, said that before his government came to power, the general public would shy away from going to the police in some areas during the day and before evening, people returned home
 Used to come, but now they return on their own free will
 bhartiya janata party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke chandigarh daure ko lekar congress ne kataaksh karte hue kaha he ki amit shah khud chandigarh nahin aa rahe hai, balki unako bheja ja rahaa he
 Punjab Congress President Sunil Jakhar said that for four years, the BJP did not take news of the Akalis' discovery
 is dauraan bijepi netaaon ne akali dal ke sansthaapak prakaash singh badal se haath milaanaa bhi thik nahin samajha
 Now when Amit Shah is coming to Chandigarh, the distinction is revealed
 prakaash singh badal bhi samajhate hai kiamit shahkhud se nahin aa rahe balki unako bheja ja rahaa he
 Sunil Jakhar said that the BJP and its allies are fearing the leadership of Rahul Gandhi
 jis tarah rahul gandhi ko logon kaa sahyog mil rahaa he, chaahe vah karnataka ho yaa phir kahin or, isse bijepi ke bheetar asuraksha kii bhaavana paidaa ho gai he
 Sunil Jakhane said that i do not remember whether Narendra Modi and Prakash Singh Badal had met during the last 4 years
 jab harmandir sahib ke lungar par jiesti lagane kii baat hui to logon ko ummid thi ki prakaash singh badal narendra modi se turant milakar use jiesti kii suchi se baahar kara lenge
 It seems that either the Prime Minister did not give the time to meet the Akali Dal leaders or he did not dare to talk to them on this issue
 unhone kaha ki bijepi ne akali dal kii kabhi sud naa leti agar rahul gandhi ko logon kaa samarthan naa mila hota
 He said that the farmer has been on the roads since last week but not a single word came out from the mouth of Parkash Singh Badal
 unhone kaha, 'main prakaash singh badal ko yah yaad dilaanaa chahta hum ki jis tarah dijal kii badi hui keemton ne kisaanon kii qamar tod di he or unako apane utpaada sadakon par giraane par majaboor hona pad rahaa he
 They should raise these issues in front of Amit Shah so that farmers dying of sesame seeds can survive
 'gauratlab he ki pichley kuch varshon se bijepi or punjab main uski sahyogi shiromani akali dal ke bich kai muddon ko lekar 36 kaa aankada bana hua he
 Whether it is the appointment of the Chairman of the Minorities Commission or the appointment of members
 iske alaava shiromani akali dal ko harmandir sahib ke lungar ko jiesti se baahar karwaane ke liye bhi khaasi mashkkat kerani padi
 When Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur threatened to quit her post, the central government was awakened and removed the Golden Temple kitchen from GST
 yahi nahin akali dal ke adhyaksh sukhbir singh badal to kuch din pehle saaf kah chuke hai ki endie or sahyogiyon ke bich pichley chaar saalon ke dauraan jo baithken hone chahie thi, wo nahin ho pai jiskaa unhen malaal he
 Amit Shah along with Prakash Singh Badal not only want to remove this political mess but also to formulate a strategy for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 loksabhaa main jab anya sadsy mahangaai jaise ahm masale par ho rahi charchaa ko bade gaur se sun rahe the, tab congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi neend lete paae gaye
 It is enough to surprise and awaken anyone from the fact that Rahul Gandhi is found sleeping during the issue directly related to the public
 ek ore congress loksabhaa main netaa vipaksh kii kursi paane ke liye court tak jane ko taiyaar dikh rahi he, duusari ore unke 'yuvaraj' mahangaai jaise mudde par ek tarah se samvedanheen hi najar aa rahe hai
 How the Congress, which has been reduced to 44 seats after the Lok Sabha elections, will run the opposition's religion with such an attitude, is a big question
 loksabhaa tivi se liya gaya yah shot soshal media par logon ne saajha kiya, ise badi dilchaspee ke saath dekha or us par chutili tippaniyan bhi kii
 On the one hand, the Congress rejected the allegation that Rahul was sleeping, while the BJP took a sarcasm saying that the Congress has been doing the same for the last 10 years on the issue of inflation
 congress pravaktaa abhishek manu singhvi ne kaha, ‘yah sach nahin he
 i reject this charge outright
 ’ singhvi ne kaha ki maamle ko sansanikhej tareeke se pesh kiya gaya he
 He also wondered if raising such issues is a privilege
 singhvi ne kaha ki pichley saat hafte se sarkaar ne ‘ochhi or badale kii raajnneeti’ kii he
 Amazing Rahul ji 
 
 khayr, jab rahul gandhi kii vah tasviir ai, to soshal media main use khub share kiya gaya
 There was a barrage of comments
 bhaajapa pravaktaa shahanvaj hossain ne kaha, ‘mahangaai ke mudde par congress pichley 10 saal se so rahi thi
 And today when inflation was being discussed in the Parliament, only the Crown Prince of Congress slept
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘congress mahangaai or keemton main badhottaree par charchaa karne ko taiyaar nahin he
 He used the term just for sloganeering
 congress keemton main badhottaree ke mudde par kabhi gambhir nahin rahi or isliye rahul gandhi itane bor ho gaye ki unhen neend aa gai
 'rahul Gandhi was seen sleeping in Parliament during a debate on price rise
 That's what the Congress was doing during their 10 yr rule
 - Shahnawaz Hussain (@shahnawazbjp) July 9, 2014it's not his fault

 com / qsl48wnwoc — Sambit Patra (@sambitswaraj) July 9, 2014 Responding to bjp's allegations, Congress leader Rajiv Shukla said that 'a trivial and lifeless issue' is being flagged in a non-urgent manner
 shukla ne kaha, ‘sabase pehali baat he ki yah koi vivaad nahin he
 This is a trivial and lifeless issue that is being unnecessarily highlighted
 mere sansadeey kariyar ke pichley 14 saal main maine sansad main shahanvaj hossain kii apni party bhaajapa ke kai logon ko sote or jhapai lete dekha he
 'he said,' Sometimes people close their eyes and listen to speech with great patience
 rahul gandhi ke saath bhi aisa hi hua hoga
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee used to close his eyes during the debate
 iskaa kya matlab he?’ congress netaa ne kaha, ‘bhaajapa ke kai mantri ab bhi sote yaa jhapai lete hai jinhen ve ‘kaitnap’ kehete hai
 Rahul Gandhi may be listening patiently
 aap gaiyr-jaruri tareeke se ise badhaachadhaakar pesh kar rahe hai
 Meanwhile, the NCP also came to the rescue of Rahul and said that closing the eyes does not mean sleeping
 ensipi ke varisht netaa prafull patel ne kaha, ‘sansad main kai log apni ankhen band kar lete hai
 This does not mean that they are sleeping

 You meet someone
 wo aapse mithi-mithi baaten karata he, aapaki thodi si tarif kar detaa he or aapako lagane lagata he ki wo ek acha insaan he
 But if your thinking is hundred percent correct, it is very unlikely to happen
 amuman ladkiyaan bahut jaldi kisi par bharosa kar leti hai or dhokhaa khaati hai
 But by showing a little understanding, you can avoid getting cheated
 ye hai wo 5 baaten jinhen dhyaan main rakhkar aap bhi dhokheybaaj mardon se batch sakati hai
 1
 da mistry manho saktaa he aapako uskaa rahasyamayi hona hi pasand ho lekin uski yahi aadat shaq paidaa karti he
 Such people are mostly engaged in their mobiles, but whenever you see their inbox, it will look empty
 jin logon main dhokhaa dene kii pravriti hoti he ve apni har cheez ko chhipaakar yaa raaj banaakar rakhte hai
 Neither their departure nor their arrival is known
 2
 a man who talks too much sweet, if he flirts too much, then you need to be careful
 jarurat se zyada mithi baaten karne vaale log apane man main kai duusari baaten bhi rakhte hai
 Does he talk to you sweetly, but when you talk to him about the future, does he become dull
 agar uskaa vyavhaar aisa he tobehatar hoga ki aap saavdhaan ho jaaie
 3
 kya wo aapse judi baton ko lekar laaparvaah he?kya wo aapse judi baton ko lekar bahut adhik laaparvaah he? kya wo har jaruri taarikh bhul jaataa he or uske baad ulte-sidhe bahaane banaata he? aise logon par bharosa karnaa khatarnaak ho saktaa he
 4
 kya wo aapako control karne kii koshish karata he?kya aapako uske saath rahete hue ghutan kaa ehsaas hota he? kya uskaa jarurat se zyada pojesive or protective hona aapako bura lagata he? agar aapako lagata he kiwo aapako control karne kii koshish kar rahaa haito behatar hoga ki aap usase alag ho jaaen
 5
 kya wo aapaki pahchaan ko raaj rakhata he?kya wo aapaki pahchaan ko chhipaakar rakhata he? agar wo aapke saath apane rishte ko logon se chhipaakar rakhata he to behatar hoga ki aap usase alag hi ho jaaen
 On the one hand, the Congress party is patting its back on the announcement of debt waiver by the newly elected governments in three states, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is raising questions about the debt waiver by the Congress led governments in Punjab and Karnataka
 bijepi ne congress par kisaanon par kisaan karjamaafee se peeche hatane kaa iljaam lagaate hue kaha he ki ab to donon rajyon ke kisaanon ko notice aane lage hai
 Union Minister Prakash Javadekar alleged that promising Congress and then retracting from it was no new thing
 karnataka, madhyapradesh or chhatisgarh main congress ne vaada kiya lekin use nahin nibhaayaa
 In Karnataka, the government there had talked about loan waiver of 45 thousand crores, but that too proved to be hollow
 unhone kaha ki pichley 6 maheene main karnataka main 397 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii
 This is the track record of Congress
 prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha ki punjab or karnataka ke kisaanon kaa karj maaf to hua nahin, ulataa kisaanon ko bainkon kii taraf se notice die ja rahe hai, unke khilaaf mukademe darj kiye ja rahe hai
 He said that there was talk of loan waiver of 90 thousand crores in Punjab too, but farmers were cheated there too
 jaavdekar ne aarope lagaaya ki 50 saal se congress kii kisaan virdohi niti ke kaaran hi kisaanon kii durdasha hui he
 The farmers were not given the right price for their crops
 swaminathan kamishan kii siforishein modi sarkaar ne hi lagu kii, jabaki congress ne is maamle main kabhi kuch nahin kiya
 Promises were made by cheating farmers in five states
 jo haal karnataka or punjab main hua, vahi madhyapradesh rajasthan or chhattisgarh main bhi hone vaala he
 Whenever we do wrong things, tab pitayee bhi lagaai he
 Let us all follow the path baat sadaa doharaai he, The glory of the Guru is unique

 If you want to marry your girlfriend without the wishes of her family, then arrange at least 50 thousand rupees

 hardoi ke police adheekshak govind agarwal ne bataaya ki parijanon kii marji ke bina koi premi shaadi ke liye premika ko bhaga le jaataa he to us par apharan kaa mukadmaa darj hota he
 But when the girl turns into an adult and goes with her lover on her own, the matter gets defused
 lekin ab aise maamle ko samaapt karaane ke liye premi ko uski premika ke naam teen saal tak ke liye 50 hajaar rupee fiks dipasit karne honge
 If everything is correct then this money will be returned
 lekin premi agar farebi niklaa or jivan sangini bani premika ko thukaraane kii koshish, shoshan yaa pareshaan kiya to 50 hajaar rupee to jaaenge hi uske khilaaf kanoonee karrwai bhi kii jaaegi
 With the curtain on Karnataka's political drama on Wednesday, everyone's eyes will turn to the by-elections in two seats in UP on May 28
 28 may ko upi main kairana loksabhaa seat or nurpur vidhansabha seat ke liye matdaan hona he
 These by-elections are seen as an election battle of 'BJP vs Opposition solidarity'
 ye bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki in upachunaav ke nateezon se 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye kis tarah kaa ran sajega, us bare main bhi kaaphi kuch sanket milegaa
 On Tuesday, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) also announced its support to the opposition candidates in Kairana and Noorpur to give a further edge to the opposition solidarity

 Tabsum Hasan, who is contesting the election with the symbol of the Rashtriya Lok Dal, also has the support of the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Congress
 nurpur vidhansabha seat ke liye bijepi ummidavaar avani singh kaa muqabla samaajawaadee party ummidavaar naeem-ul-hasan se he
 Political experts say that the Aam Aadmi Party has a very limited base in UP
 aise main is party ke vipakshi ummidavaaron ko samarthan se beshak nattejey par kuch khaas asar naa pade lekin isse 2019 aam chunaav ke lievipakshi ekajutataaki muhim ko jarur takat milegi
 Let us tell you that in the by-elections for the Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha seats in UP a few months ago, the BSP supported the Samajwadi Party candidates
 donon jagah hi sapa (espi) ke ummidavaaron ko vijay mili thi
 It will be interesting to see how supporters of Aam Aadmi Party will join hands with Congress, SP, BSP, Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal

 supreme court ne bal vivaah ke maamle par sunwaayee karte hue kaha ki hamaare paas teen vikalp hai, pehla is apwaad ko hataa den jiskaa matlab he ki bal vivaah ke maamle main 15 se 18 saal kii ladki ke saath agar uskaa pati sambandh banaata he to use rape mana jaae
 The court said that the second option is to implement the POSCO Act in this case, that in case of child marriage, if a husband makes a relation with a girl of 15 to 18 years, then she should be taken under POSCO
 vahiin teesraa vikalp ye he ki isamen kuch na kiya jaae or ise apwaad mana jaae, jiskaa matlab ye he ki bal vivaah ke maamle main 15 se 18 saal kii ladki ke saath agar uskaa pati sambandh banaae to wo rape nahin mana jayega
 It was said on behalf of the petitioner that child marriage is violating the rights of children

 At the same time, the third option is that nothing should be done in this and it should be considered an exception, which means that in the case of child marriage, if a husband with a girl of 15 to 18 years has a relationship then she will not be considered a rape
 yachikakarta kii taraf se kaha gaya ki bal vivaah se bacchon ke adhikaron kaa ulanghan ho rahaa he
