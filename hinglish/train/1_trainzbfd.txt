 Hi
 
 
 main raveesh kumaar
 Today we will talk about the international situation in the national situation
 yah vah paristhiti he, jis par kisi bhi sarkaar kaa koi niyantran nahin hota or isi kaaran petrol, dijal or gas ke daam bad jate hai
 But as a result of this international situation, the prices of potatoes and onions increase in the national situation, why is the government not able to stop it from many kinds of meetings and instructions? aisa na ho paane kii sthiti main raajnneetik dal do maheene pehle tak manmohan singh ke putale jalaate the, aaj-kal narendra modi ke jalaane lage hai
 Kasur of international situation and effigy burning leaders of national situation
 pradarshan boring ho chuke hai
 Samajwadi Party, breaking this boredom, took out the idea of motorcycle burial instead of effigy burning in Varanasi
 maamla secular lage, isliye ek jagah bike ko supurde khaak kiya gaya, to duusari jagah hindu reeti se maa ganga main bike kaa pratikatmak visarjan kiya gaya
 Inflation makes political parties creative
 jo bijepi manmohan sarkaar ke khilaaf bharat band kiya karti thi, vah aaj-kal bharat sarkaar chalaa rahi he
 Even after this, the hair of the international situation is not being able to fade
 fark sirf itnaa aayaa he ki jo baaten manmohan singh bolaa karte the, vahi baaten bijepi kehane lagi he
 BJP used to call Manmohan as Silent Mohan, now Congress has started calling Modi as Silent Modi
 main ek baat samaj gaya hum
 In India, inflation can be fought only while in opposition, because this opposition and pokemon can wash the international situation properly while in opposition
 udhaaharan ke liye tab vipaksh ke dhardaar pravaktaa ke taur par prakaash jaavdekar sahab petrol dijal ke daam badhaane par kehete the ki sarkaar logon se jazia kar vasuul rahi he
 It is not acceptable at all
 sarkaar kaa yah tark ki antarrashtriya keemton ke kaaran daam bade hai, yah galat he
 How much this government will rob people
 ab prakaash jaavdekar mantri ban gaye hai, lekin antarrashtriya paristhiti ke khilaaf to janata ne vot nahin diya tha, lihaaja petrol-dijal or gaiyr sabsidi vaale silendar ke daam badhane par vah kehete hai ki mahangaai samasya he, lekin jaisaa ki ham jaanate hai ki hamen yah samasya viraasat main mili he
 People have seen what the UPA government has done in ten years
 mahangaai kaa mudda electric switch nahin he ki on kar diya or of kar diya
 There are some international circumstances behind it
 saal 2011 main pranab mukherjee ne kaha tha ki mahangaai dur karne ke liye sarkaar koi jaadu kii chadi nahin ghuma sakati
 In June of 2014, the name of this magic wand became electronic switch
 kya koi rajaneta he, jo aisi tukbandiyon ke aage jaakar mahangaai ke kaarnon or dur karne main hamaari majaburiyon yaa shaktiyon ke bare main vishwasaneey tareeke se bataa sake
 Have you seen a hoarder around you or in a relationship? rashtriya paristhiti main yahi vah khor hai, jinke pakade jate hi mahangaai kam hone ke asaar najar aane lagenge
 The entire government of India is searching for these hoarders, instructing each other that if you catch, you catch
 isse pehle ki ye pakade jaaen bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi ne rajyon se aagrah kiya he ki ve jamkhori ke maamalon ke liye vishesh adaalat kaa prabandh karen
 And don't ask about this fucking nautical onion, like it is irritated by every government
 upie ke samay anand sharma kaha karte the ki jamaakhoron ke kaaran pyaaj ke daam bade hai
 Many Congress leaders had given pro-bjp hoarders the reason
 shila dikshit sarkaar ke mantri haaron yusuf ne tab madhya pradesh sarkaar par aarope lagaaya tha ki vahaan jamaakhoron ke khilaaf uchit karrwai na hone ke kaaran pyaaj ke daam bad rahe hai
 Now the government has changed, today quoting sources, BJP said that it is the work of Congress hoarders
 ye baat kehane ke liye bhi sutron kaa sahaara liya gaya
 After all, how long will the Delhi government continue to make arrangements to sell onions and are the prices of these onions only getting expensive in Delhi
 saal 2011 main dilli main jab aise hi chaape pad rahe the, tab vyapaaree hadtaal par chale gaye the
 Then the traders had said that the government is defaming us traders as hoarders
 is baar rashtrahit main vyapaariyon kii aisi kisi bhaawanaaon ke aahat hone kii koi khabar nahin he
 Today, the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi made 52 teams and raided across the state and left them to bring onions, potatoes, pulses and edible oils
 press rilijanusaar in 52 ashvamedhi tiimon ne din bhar main 549 thikaanon par chaape maare or 104 logon ke khilaaf maamle darj kar die
 There is no mention of these caught hoarders or Congress, but illegal stocks of 12000 quintal pulses and rice are reported to be caught
 19 june ko bhi dilli main 532 thikaanon par chaape pade the or 42 logon ke khilaaf mukadmaa darj hua tha
 Union Food and Supplies Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has said that we have no shortage of rice, wheat, sugar, potatoes and onions
 paswan kehete hai ki jo bhi tivi main, akhbaar main sunata he ki monsoon kam ho gaya to jamkhori karne lagata he
 But why is Paswan ji not afraid to hear the same hoarder on TV that the government is searching for him
 paswan ne kaha ki 4 july ko desh bhar ke khaadya mantriyon kii baithak bulaai gai he
 a month ago, there were hoardings all over the country, in which Narendra Modi's slogan was written that now will not bear the brunt of inflation
 magar bayanon se to yahi lagata he ki janata se zyada sarkaar hi mahangaai kii maar sah rahi he
 In the last 17 days, the Modi government has held four major meetings on the impact on monsoon and inflation
 teen baithkon kii adhyakshata to pradhanmantri ne khud kii he
 Apart from this, there have been many meetings in the Ministry of Food and Consumer Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture, but what has been the result? In March 2011, Narendra Modi gave 20 suggestions to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and suggested 64 steps that could be taken
 yani formula to he magar vah ection kahaan he
 If there is action then why there is inflation? vittamantri jetali ne kaha he ki mahangaai bardaasht kii seemaa se bhi zyada he
 So what should the public do? He can get his anger out of these statements or return home from the market, read a book of economics or leave the hope of inflation down

 panipat kii (teesri) ladaai itihaas main darj he
 But more than this, it has been alive in public discussion in the Indian public
 14 janvari, 1761 kii us ladaai main lagbhag nasht ho gai ek jati us charchaa kaa ek ahm pahalu rahi he
 The roots of that caste were lost
 use khoj nikaalnaa itihaaskaaron ke liye ek chunauti bharaa kaam tha
 This challenge was now resolved after two centuries
 jaahir he, parakramee purvajon se apana judaav sthapit ho jane se ab vah jati garv ke saath apane mul samudaay se phir jud saki
 In that battle of Panipat, Afghan invader Ahmad Shah Abdali had dismantled and defeated the brave Maratha forces led by the commander Sadashivrao Bhau
 kuch maratha sainik laapata ho gaye
 The search ended with the completion of 250 years of that war
 25 janvari 2012: tasveeron main dekhen india tudeth saal ke shodh ke baad ab yah sabit karne ke liye paryaapt saboot mil gaye hai ki panipat ke aasapaas ke 230 gaanvon main based road samudaay ke chah lakh log darasal un 500 maratha sainikon ke hi vanshaj hai, jo abdali kii fouj ke haathon, teetar-bitar kar die jane ke baad jangalon main chhip gaye the
 There is no mention of road caste in this area in the records before 1761
 gauratlab he ki panipat kii ladaai main 50,000 se zyada maratha sainik maare gaye the, jo bache, unhen jangalon main chhipana padaa kyonki afgaanon ne yuddh kaa naaraa hi de rakhaa tha, 'ek maratha mundi lao, sone kaa ek sikaa paao
 'those killed in the war include Sadashivrao Bhau, Vishwasrao, son of Peshwa Balaji Bajirao, Janakoji of Gwalior's royalty and Tukoji Scindia, Yashwantrao Pawar of Dhar and Dewas families besides Jadhav, Nimbalkar, Bhapkar (chavan), Bhonsle, Kadam
 , Phalke, Bhoite, Pagude, Sawant and several unknown Maratha families
 maratha topakhane ke bahadur muslim senapati ibrahim khan gardi ko to afgaanon ne badi berahami se maaraa
 Their crime? They were fighting on behalf of the Marathas
 gardi kii sena ke 5,000 muslim sainik bhi is yuddh main maare gaye the
 Not a single one showed his back
 11 janvari 2012: tasveeron main dekhen india toderod samudaay kii jadon kii khojbin ek dashak pehle haryana ke purv naukarshah or maratha jagriti sangh ke adhyaksh, 64 varshiya virendra singh verma urf jaakhale ne shuru kii
 In his words, 'from Marathi words in our Hindi dialect, from our style of old havelis, our love for horses, our surnames and our traditions prove that we are the descendants of the Maratha soldiers lost from the Battle of Panipat
 is jaankaree ke saamne aane se puraa samudaay puraani yaadon main doobane ke saath hi garv ke bhav se bhar gaya he
 Vasantrao More, a well-known Maratha historian, taught history at Kolhapur University
 unhone panipat yuddh ke road marathaon kaa itihaas naam se ek pustak likhi he
 He says, "the efforts of the Peshwas themselves to search for the Maratha soldiers who were lost in the Battle of Panipat and then the scholars of the Punjab University could not succeed
" vajah? unamem se kisi kaa bhi vaasta panipat ke aasapaas based road samudaay se nahin padaa tha
 More than 80 percent of the Road community surnames resemble Marathas
 yahi sthiti unki kai paramparaon or road samudaay kii sthaneey boli ke kai shabdon kii he
 '04 January 2012: See India Today in the pictures, the biggest clue in revealing this important fact was only by surnames
 road samudaay ke maratha upanaamon main pavaar, chavaan, bhonsle, saavant, memaane, dudhane, khokhre, khasbare, gole, dhabaade, bodley, jhontyle, shellar, bataane or kai anya hai
 Many of the words in his language are typical Marathi
 maharashtra kii mithi roti puranpoli ko ve 'poli' kehete hai
 The rupee is called 'hoon'
 chhatrapati shivaji kii mudra kaa naam bhi hun tha
 This is the only community in Haryana that eats lentils and rice at night
 marathi gaanvon main aaj bhi yah ek parampara he
 Many Maratha soldiers involved in the Battle of Panipat were from the Konkan region of Maharashtra
 isi vajah se road samudaay ke geeton main samudr kaa zikr he
 It is not mentioned in any other caste of Haryana
 road samudaay kii shaadiyon main maamaaon kii utani hi mahatvapurn bhoomika hoti he, jitani ki maharashtra main
 Hari Singh Pawar, a 63-year-old road Maratha farmer, while gobbling hookah at his house in Kemla village near Karnal, says, "there is no doubt that we are descendants of Maratha soldiers who survived the Battle of Panipat
" abhi haal tak road pariwaron main talavaarein or bhaale hua karte the
 Everyone knows our love for horses
 ' jhak safed saafaa baandhne vaale or puraani maratha parampara kii baaliyaan kaan main pahanane vaale 80 saal ke lakhapat singh thardak kehete hai, 'is ilaake main road hi hai, jo maraathon kii tarah ghodon ke prati apana prem barkaraar rakhe hue hai
 And this love has been going on for generations
 ' thardak ke bhattije or mehnatee kisaan 25 varshiya rajvir singh or unke bhai ne gaanv main havelinuma makaan banwaaya he
 Until recently the village used to have Maratha style havelis
 28 disambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india todesanjhari gaanv kii ek tuuti-phooti haveli main maratha vaastukala ke aks saaf dekhe ja sakate hai

 'the conclusive proof of the Maratha roots of the Road community is to speak' Chhatrapati Ki Jai '(named after Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj) in the villages here
 yah parampara pidiyon se chali aa rahi he
 Dadupur Kala village has several families with Maratha surnames
 yahaan haal hi main road maratha samudaay kaa ek bada bhawan banwaaya gaya he
 81-year-old Indraj Singh Dudhane of the same village says, 'our mothers say' Chhatrapati ki Jai 'even when the child sneezes here
 yah ek bada saboot he
 '86-year-old Abhiram Dudhane, sitting with him, says,' Like Maharashtra, the festival of bhai-dooj here after Diwali is more important than Rakhi
 yah baat haryana kii baaki jatiyon ke liye behad anuthi he
 'the dress of the women of the road community is similar to that of the women of Haryana, but their style of covering the head in front of the elderly is exactly the same as that of rural Marathi women
 21 disambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india tudekuch bujurgon ke paas badi dilachasp baaten hai
 90-year-old Baruram Khasabre, who lives with his 86-year-old wife Sunhari Devi and sons-in-law in Dadupur Khurd village, says, "I remember it a little bit, Dad used to tell me how before the battle of Panipat we had the fort of Kunjpura Muslims
 And how some of our horses accidentally fell into a pond in that battle and then we settled in the jungles
 ' road samudaay ke maratha sambandhon kaa ek or sanket yah he ki is ilaake main baaki samudaayon kii tulana main unki santanon kii paidaaish zyada tej dar se hui he, taaki ve badi sankhya se khud ko surakshit kar saken
 Between 1911 and 2001, the population of the road community has increased more than 14 times, many times more than other castes in the region
 afgaanon ko lagbhag haraa dene vaale maraathon kii veerta ne ahmedshah abdali ko itnaa prabhavit kiya tha ki usne us vakt jaipur ke shaasha madhav singh ko likhi chitthee main likhaah 'marathe bahut hi bahaduree se lade
 It was not a matter of any other caste bus

 But we won in the end with better strategy and Allah‚Äôs Fazal
 ' abdali, jo itihaas main ahmedshah durrani ke naam se janaa jaataa he, 1761 se pehle bharat par paanch se zyada baar hamalaa kar chukaa tha, lekin 1761 ke baad usne bharat par ek baar bhi hamalaa nahin kiya
 This shows that after this Abdali had no strength to attack India again
 yuddh main uske bhi 35,000 se zyada sainikon ke maare jane kii baat kahi jaati he
 14 December 2011: Look in the pictures, in the words of India Today, 'at a time when we were divided among religions / castes
 yah yuddh rashtriya ekta kii shandaar misaal pesh karata he
 Abdali tried hard to lure Gardi and his Muslim soldiers in the name of religion, but failed
 yuddh main ghayal maratha senapati mahadji sindhiya ke praan ek muslim raane khan ne bachaae the
 He was a friend of Scindia's life
 sindhiya use is ghatana ke baad se bhai kah kar pukaarte the
 After the Battle of Panipat in the 1780s, when the Marathas, led by Mahadji Scindia, regained their lost prestige in North India and became patrons of the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam, Panipat still had a special place in his mind
 sindhiya ke senapati or jamaai ladojirao shitole kii sevaaon se khush hokar shah alam ne unhen dilli ke uttar main 100 gaanv dene kii peshkash kii to shitole ne unase panipat kaa naam samraat se yah kehete hue liya ki 'panipat mere dil main basaa hua he, kyonki hamaare logon ne vahaan par apana khun bahaya he
 'panipat remained the estate of Shitole till 1860
 baad main banaras kii sandhi main anya ilaakon ke evaj main ise angrejon ko saunp diya gaya
 Road Maratha farmer Kuldeep Singh Bhonsle, who lives with all his relatives near the historic fort of Kunjpura, says, "the fact that the descendants of the soldiers who survived the Battle of Panipat gave us a proud identity
 ' kunjpura main unke jaise kareeb 200 bhonsle rahete hai, jinamein unke bhattije roopendra, jasvindar or bhatiji minaldevi shaamil hai
 07 December 2011: See in pictures India Today on the advice of senior Congress leader Uday Singh Gaikwad of Maharashtra, the Haryana government has built a magnificent memorial at the battle site in 1992

 It is rightly said that the bravery of the brave is always alive

 '' ishk main jab aap aapa khote hai to syapa hota he, jise 'ishkiyapa' kehete hai
 This is the name of the second book of author Pankaj Dubey - Ishkiyapa
 is kitaab ko unhone khud hi angreji or hindi main likhaa he
 The book has a national launch at the Oxford Bookstore in New Delhi on 23 September
 isaki online pribooking shuru ho gai he
 Pankaj, who hails from the small town of Chaibasa in Jharkhand, has earlier written 'looser Kahi Ka' which has been a bestseller
 is kitaab par unki film kii bhi taiyaari he
 We talked to him in this connection
 unhone apaneishkiyape ke kissesunaye, nowell-riting kii baarikiyon par baat kii or pareshaan ladakon ke liye tips bhi die
 Read the whole conversation: Question: Ishkiyapa's name is clear that this is a new-age love story
 lekin thodaa detail main bataaen, kitaab kaa kya becoground he?pankaj:jab main nayaa daur kahata hum to yah bilkul nayaa daur he
 Ever since the world started settling on the Internet
 orkut aayaa, vah chirkut ho gaya or phir fasebuk or twitor aa gaye
 So is the story of that period
 aisa bihar he jahaan kidnaping industry fal-phool rahi he
 There is a hero in Patna, a heroine
 hero kaa naam he lallan jha
 He starts new businesses, but fails
 heroin kidnaping mafia se vidhayak or phir mantri bane ek shaks kii beti he
 The name is Sweety Pandey
 vah sone ke pinjre main he, lekin use aazaadee chahie
 He has big Mumbai Dreams
 ladke ke parivaar kaa motor driving skool kaa bijness he, jo vah karnaa nahin chahta
 One day the girl wants to learn driving
 to phone jaataa he shahar ke sabase achche driving skool main
 So Father Sir send Lallan Jha to go teach the minister's daughter to driving
 lallan ko isamen mauka dikhataa he ministar tak pahunchane or use apane bijness idiaj bataane kaa
 Ishkiyapa then starts from Patna to Mumbai by putting the foot on the clutch and pressing the brake and accelerator
 kahani kaa becoground puri tarah kaalpanik he, par samajhadaar pathak use sahi jagah se jod lenge
 Question: What is the status of the film 'looser Kahin Ka'? Pankaj: Casting is still underway
 koshish kar rahe hai ki sardiyon main shoot kar len
 Between November to February
 shooting dilli main hi karenge
 i want Rajkummar Rao for the lead role
 baaki pikchar to banani hi he
 i will not leave until i break
 sawaal: abhi hindi diwas hokar gaya
 People have different opinions about how Hindi will proceed
 aap kis kism kii hindi ke pakshdhar hai?pankaj:talab vaali nahin, nadi vaali hindi kaa pakshdhar hum
 No one needs to be a patron
 hindi nadi kaa jal he, jo alag-alag jameen kii samskritiyon ko samahit karte hue bahata jaae, hameshaa ravaanagi main rahe
 Some people unnecessarily become local guardians
 hindi bahut badi or samrudh he
 i agree that it is the language of convenience and conversation
 ise mathadhishon kii giraft se bachaakar rakhana he
 Question: How do you assess the reader's potential for cow belt area? Pankaj: There are unlimited possibilities
 kyonki ab bhi sahitya or bhashaa ko lekar bahut sajagata he
 Even now they are yet to be corrupted
 mahanagareey or videshi chizon ko dekhne kaa unka maarg kitabon or media tuls se hokar gujarata he
 The small cities of the country are bigger
 vahaan urvarak reader base he
 Variety
 kai paraten hai
 Take a close shot of the malls in Delhi and Mumbai, it will look the same
 lekin lakhanu or bhopal ko log sadakon se pahchaan lete hai
 Small cities are amazing
 main khud chote shahar se aata hum
 i am not attached to the ground, buried in the ground
 chote shaharon se hi hamen chaara miltaa he apni rachanaaon ke liye
 Small cities have great power
 sawaal:mjedaar fiction likhane ke liye van liners aane kitne jaruri hai? aap unka kaisaa istemaal karte hai?pankaj:bahut zyada jaruri hai
 Be interesting
 boring na hon
 Challenging works for the author
 agar aapaki baat dilachasp nahin he to pathak ke paas vikalpon kaa ambara he
 If you licked his mind in a sentence, he will not read you
 par khyaal yah rakhana he ki vanaliner miningles na ho, unke taar kahani ke plot se jude hon
 For example, you say that there is a power in pain that gives vision
 yah pathak ko samaj nahin aayega
 He has to tell that there is a power in the breakup
 usko pataa he ki jab brallep hota he to dard hota he
 Question: How much has you done? Pankaj: You have done enough
 jeevanstyli rahi he
 i also favor positive flirt, because it keeps your mind alert and creative
 kisi ladki ko impress karne main kaaphi mehnat or sens of humar kii jarurat hoti he
 Anyway girls are very choosy nowadays and they have high expectations
 aapako un par khara utarana hoga
 It helps me to be creative
 sawaal:aapke ishkiyape ke kuch kisse?pankaj:haa ek kissa yaad aata he
 a beautiful girl was seen at a bus stop
 bindiya naam tha
 i made her name the heroine of loser
 haa to wo bas stop par khadi thim to main unke paas gaya or bolaa ki lagata he ham kahin mili hai
 So she turned back and said, 'no, basically you wanted to talk to me
 ' meri chori pakadi gai to maine eemaandaaree kaa rasta lete hue baat maan lee
 There was a lot of talk, i asked if we will meet tomorrow? He said that i have a boyfriend
 maine kaha ki mujhe isse koi dikkat nahin, main khule dil kaa hum
 She did not say anything, sat in the bus
 tabhi didlje ai thi
 As i left, i said that i will wait tomorrow
 agle din main istari kiye hue doston ke kapade pahanakar bas stop pahunch gaya
 i see that she is standing up
 maine poocha to kehane lagi, 'maine aij close karke ganpati bhagwaan se poocha ki kya main jaaun? to unhone kaha ki jaao betaa
 'just then Ganesha became my favorite god too
 sawaal:samakaleen lekhakon main pasandida koun hai?pankaj:padhane kaa zyada vakt nahin miltaa
 There is also a risk of getting affected
 aisa koi pasandida nahin he
 How can i speak good bad to someone hamen kisi kii kya darkaar
 We have our government
 sawaal:paanch tips un ladakon ke liye jinaki garlfriend nahin bani he? kya karen or kya na karen?pankaj:- sabase pehle jaruri he ki restaurant vagairah main jaaen to bill ladke pe karen
 Make yourself financially prosperous for this
 kaise banaaen main nahin jaanata
 If possible, you must also learn to play guitar
 ladakiyon ko bahut pasand aata he- photography jaananaa bhi jaruri he
 Girls are fond of being photographed
 agar aap badhiya photo khinchate hai to girls paas aaengi
 They will get a permanent photographer
 - ladki ke saamne munh mitha mitthu na bane
 Be patient kalyaan hoga
 - If the girl is going to like it so much that she has to beat it, then pay attention to her friend, ignoring her
 har baar uski saheli kii tarif kiijie
 This is a very effective method

 is nae kanoon main aarakshan kaa hakdaar hone ke liye jin sharton kaa ullekh tha, unamem se ek yah bhi tha ki abhyarthi kii vaarshik aay aath lakh rupee salanaa se zyaada na ho
 But the opposition criticized the government bitterly on this issue as 20% income tax is levied on the income of Rs 8 lakh as per the current rates of income tax
 vipaksh kaa kahana tha ki jo shaks apni kamai kaa paanchvaan hissaa inakam tex ke rup main sarkaar ko de rahaa he, vah aarthik rup se kamazor kaise mana ja saktaa he, yaa duusare shabdon main jise sarkaar aarakshan kanoon main 'garib' bataa rahi he, usase vah 20 fisadi tex kaise le sakati he
 According to sources, to answer the exact same criticism, the Finance Minister can increase the tax-free income limit to Rs five lakh in this budget, which is currently only 2
 5 lakh rupee he
 Apart from this, the limit of tax-free income to be given on investment under Section 80C of Income Tax Act is also 1
 5 lakh rupee se badhaakar teen lakh rupee kiya ja saktaa he, taaki aath lakh rupee tak kamaane waalon ko kisi tarah kaa tex nahin dena pade
 Apart from this, sources say, changes in income tax slabs have also been sought for a long time, but at the moment there is no scope for change in them, because if the above provisions are made, and the tax exempt income limit is actually If it is increased from two and a half lakh rupees to five lakh rupees, then it is likely to have a significant impact on the public exchequer, so at the moment any change in the income tax slab Will not be done at this time
 maujuuda samay main dhai lakh rupee tak kii aay par koi kar nahin liya jaataa he, jabaki dhai se paanch lakh rupee tak kii kamai par paanch fisadi, paanch se 10 lakh rupee tak kii karyogy aay par 20 fisadi or 10 lakh rupee se zyaada kii aay par 30 fisadi inakam tex dena hota he
 Now according to the news from sources, if income up to five lakh rupees is tax-exempt, then the income tax slab in India will be automatically changed, and the lowest slab will be 20 per cent, which is more than five lakh rupees
 Has to be paid on the income of sutron ne bataaya he ki iske baad bhi dhara 80 si ke tahat bachat karne waalon ko teen lakh rupee tak kii raashi ko karyogy aay main se ghataane kaa haq hoga, taaki aath lakh rupee tak kii aay par koi kar na dena pade
 Thousands of lies have to be made to hide a lie

 Shoaib is embarrassed by his lies in the world's most intimate relationship
 aisa bhala kaise ho saktaa he ki shaadi ko lekar ek shaks jitani baar munh khole, ek nai baat kah de
 Never call a girl his wife and then do not even recognize that girl
 lekin, shoeb malik ne aisa kiya
 Shoaib sometimes smiles and calls Hyderabad his in-laws (hyderabad is my wife's city
 
 
 -taarikh- 30

 - Date - 27

 lekin, jab koi or pasand aa gaya, to shoeb ke bol badal gaye
 The Ayesha whom he once accepted as his wife, is now ashamed of the relationship with that Ayesha
 puraani baton kii kisi ne yaad dilaai to shoeb safai se kehete hai ki wo to aaysha ke dabaav main unhone shaadi kii baat kah di(wo to usne kaha to maine kah diya

 ab bhala ise kya samajha jaae
 What could be better than a joke
 ek rishte ko bhala isse zyada or badnaam kaise kiya ja saktaa he
 Shoaib married a girl first and then denied her
 inkaar bhi aise-vaise nahin, apni patni ko saream bahan kehete bhi nahin sharmaae (main apni aapa ko kaise talaak duun
 
 
 - Date - 05

 ek rishte main shoeb ke aise hi naa jane kitne jhooth bole
 But no matter how many lies are told, the truth remains one day or the other
 sabit ho gaya ki shoeb malik ne jhooth or jhooth hi bolaa
 Married a girl
 phir shaadi se inkaar ke liye naa jane kitne jhooth bole
 Shoaib even called his wife a sister
 jhooth number 7meraa nikaah hua hi nahin
 
 
 If not married, then how did they divorce
 nikaah ko lekar to aapane khub saboot maange, talaak ke vakt to gavaah bhi the
 Shoaib and Ayesha's divorce exposes Shoaib's lies
 jis nikaah se wo lagaataar inkaar karte rahe, usase bachane ke liye talaak bhi le liya
 Now let them tell themselves that when the marriage did not happen, how did the divorce happen
 jhooth number 8nikaahnamaa logon kii samaj main nahin atanikah ko lekar shoeb ke jhooth kaa bhandaphod usee press conference main ho gaya, jisamen wo apni sachai kii duhai dene pahunche the
 They say that i did not marry, yes, i did sign the Nikahnama
 jhooth number 9nikaahnaame main mere dastakhmb shoeb hi bataaen ki agar nikaah nahin kiya, to nikaahnaame par dastakhat kyon kar die
 On the contrary, challenge Ayesha to prove that she was married
 jhooth number 10shaadi hui to pruf karo naab ek ladki jo pareshaan he, dekh rahi he ki uskaa pati uski saheli se shaadi karne ja rahaa he
 And challenge from above such that prove that the marriage took place
 aaysha ne bhi daawa kiya ki ab sabar kaa imtihaan mat lo, saboot aise hai ki tum sun naa sakoge
 Talking till today, Ayesha said that there is a lot of evidence, do not force
 
 
 (taarikh - 04

 They also do not miss to say how to divorce Apa
 jhooth number 11aapa ko talaak kaise de saktaa hum
 
 
 Shoaib, cloak of lies, had also forgotten the truth that he was married to the maha whom he was calling himself
 ab shoeb hi tay karen ki wo kab sach bolte hai or kab jhooth
 What they tell the truth and what lies
 ek rishte ko to unhone rusavaa kiya hi, ek ladki ko to unhone pareshaan kiya he
 Now the question is arising whether for so long he kept trying to fool the world too
 shoeb malik ne jis aaysha se nikaah kiya tha, use pahchaanane tak se inkaar kar diya
 On Ayesha's question, he used to say that he never met
 lekin, jhooth bhala kaise pach paata
 Shoaib's four lies spoken to Ayesha were also caught on camera
 shoeb ne apane press conference main kaha tha ki jisaki tasviir he usase nahin mila
 
 
 (date - 05

 jhooth number 12photo vaali ladki ko aapa kahata tha
 
 
 Also consider once that he used to call a girl with this photo without meeting him
 lekin, abhi is jhooth ke or bhi pair hai, or har pair main sach kii bedi padi hui
 The people of Ayesha's house had openly challenged Shoaib to come forward and tell whom he met in Jeddah and Hyderabad
 is par shoeb kaa kahana tha ki wo to kabhi aaysha se mili hi nahin
 Lie No
 13 Who is Maha Apa, Aaj Tak has not met Aisha
 
 
 (taarikh - 05

 10)ye vahi shoeb hai, jo chand saal pehle aaysha ko apni sharike-hayaat kehete hue sharmaate bhi the or muskuraate bhi the

 09
 In an interview given on 04, Shoaib said that i am married, his name is Ayesha
 shoeb se jab ye kaha gaya ki wo kyon nahin wo tasviir dikhaate, jo unhen bheji gai thi, to unka jawaab ye hota he ki hamen parivaar se aisi shiksha nahin mili
 Lie No
 14 parents did not teach such
 
 
 (taarikh - 05
 04
 10)sawaal to phir ye bhi uthta he shoeb ki har yun jhooth bolnaa kisne sikhaaya
 Who taught you how to discredit the relationship
 tay ho chukaa he ki aap aaysha ko jaanate bhi the or aapane unase nikaah bhi kiya tha
 Then why deny that relationship
 ek ladki kii pareshaaniyon kaa majaak udata rahaa or shoeb jhooth par jhooth belate rahe
 In this lie of Shoaib, his upcoming wife number two Sania Mirza also strongly supported
 sania to ye bhi bhul gayi ki aaysha kabhi unki sabase kareebi saheliyon main se thi
 Four lies of Sania captured on camera
 jhooth number 15main shoeb ko 6-7 saal se jaanati hum
 
 
 The most bizarre truth of this triangle of relationships is that Ayesha, who claimed to know Shoaib for 6-7 years, was married to the same man
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki agar sania shoeb ko itane barason se jaanati thim, to phir kya ye nahin jaanati thim ki wo unheen kii bahut acchhee dost aaysha ke shuhar hai
 Lie No
 16 V
 R
 Shocked
 mujhe nahin pataa ki wo aise kyon kar rahi he
 Meaning that Sania did not know about Shoaib and Ayesha's wedding, but in this press conference in Hyderabad, Shoaib said that he has told everything to Sania
 jhooth number 17maine sania ko sab bataa diya he
 
 
 Sania also admitted that she knows what is true
 jhooth number 18mujhe pataa he ki sach kya he
 
 
 So the question is who is lying again
 shoeb kehete hai ki unhone sab bataa diya
 Sania says that she knows everything
 phir bhi wo nahin maanatin ki aaysha or shoeb kii shaadi ho chuki thi
 The truth is now in front of everyone
 sawaal ye he ki agar ye sach sania ke saamne pehle se hi the to unhone anjaan banane kaa drama kyon kiya
 If even knowing about Ayesha and Shoaib's relationship, she wanted to marry him, it was her decision
 lekin aaysha par yun hansane kaa haq to kisi ne unhen nahin diya
 Neither is it acceptable to their relationship nor to humanity
 jhooth ke jaal main shoeb funsate gaye, to unke parivaar vaale aa gaye jhooth kii kanchi lekar is jaal ko kaatane
 But he got caught in his own statements
 jhooth number 19shoeb ke bahanoi imran jafar ne kaha nikaah nahin hua
 
 
 Shoaib Malik himself admitted that he had signed the nikahnama, but his brother-in-law, who had reached Delhi to support him, says that there are no signatures
 jhooth number 20shoeb ke bahanoi imran jafar ne kaha dastakhat nahin hue
 
 
 Had to lie, we would have talked to each other at least, so that everyone could talk the same
 imran kaa kahana tha ki shaadi kaa naa koi gavaah he or naa koi saboot
 Lie No
 21 Shoaib's brother-in-law Imran Zafar said, "there is no witness
" 
 
 jhooth number 22shoeb ke bahanoi imran jafar ne kaha media se kaha kahaan he saboot
 
 
 This lie of brother-in-law was exposed by the half-brother of Shoaib, a member of the same family
 unka kahana he ki aaysha se unki shaadi hui thi
 Shoaib's half-brother Tariq Malik said that the marriage had taken place, i am his witness
 jhooth number 23shoeb ke bahanoi imran kehete hai ki pakistan main aaysha koi mudda nahin
 
 
 Discussion on this issue is hot in Pakistan
 kanoon se lekar samaajik galiyon tak main aaysha ke liye aawaaj buland ho rahi thi
 And Imran himself had arrived here so that he could save Shoaib, but where would these liars be able to understand these truths

 But on Thursday a Lashkar terrorist himself testified this
 usne bataaya ki kaise pakistan bharat ke khilaaf sajeesh rach rahaa he or kaise bhartiya sena ne use ek nai jindagi di
 This terrorist named Ejaz Ahmed Gojri is one of the 4 lashkar-e-taiba terrorists who were caught alive by the army from Baramulla
 usne apane saathiyon ke bare main baat karte hue bataaya ki mushtak, saheba, nasir or aise tamaam chehron kii jindagi katlogarat main jhonk di gai hai, ye sahi nahin he
 He told that if the army of India wanted, it could have shot it
 lekin aisa na karke bhartiya fouj ne unhen nai jindagi ke sabak die hai
 Ijaz is the face returned from the dark streets of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, whose eyes are now dreaming of new life

 He tells the wandering sad breeds of Jammu and Kashmir to return to their homes for the betterment of this country
 ejaj ahamed gojri ne kaha, 'ham log pichley 6 maheene se jangalon main rah rahe the

 hamane fire kiye the
 But the army did not fire on us
 main us din bhaaga or ham jhaadi main chhip gaye
 The army could shoot me
 lekin fouj ne mujhe giraftaar karke ek nai jindagi di
 Revealing the nefarious conspiracy of Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir, Ejaz said, "before the day i was arrested, the sat in Pakistan used to say that the army of India is like that
" aisa kuch bhi nahin he
 Come and meet them yourself

 ovaisi ne kaha ki har koi aaj mujhe target kar rahaa he, ghar main murgi anda naa de to ham jimmedaar, bhens doodh naa de to bhi ovaisi jimmedaar
 On why Mamata's statement could not stop the BJP, Asaduddin Owaisi said that these Muslims win with votes, but they have no idea that they are calling radicals not Bengalis but Owaisi
 ovaisi ne kaha ki jahaan par aap hai, vahaan bijepi ne 18 siten jeet leen
 Now if you are not able to stop the BJP, then you are questioning me

 The police have also arrested Afzal Chaudhary, along with his colleague Krishna Kumar
 CM yogi ne kiya barkhaastgaziabad ke BJP netaa afjaal ko yogi sarkaar ne beete 5 farvari ko ayog kaa sadsy niyukt kiya tha
 But after continuous complaints, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath removed Afzal Chaudhary from his post
 pad se hataae jane ke tisare hi din afjaal choudhary ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 On Thursday, Seshamani Pandey, director of the Minorities Commission, issued an order to remove Afzal Chaudhary from the post
 apane aadesh main unhone kaha ki barkhaastagi ke saath hi afjaal choudhary kii sabhi sevaayen tatkaal prabhaav se khatm kar di gai hai
 This was the kind of fraud Afzal Chaudhary alleges that he used to call the officers, sometimes calling himself a big BJP leader or sometimes a chief minister of a state and used to press them to do illegal work
 mili jaankaree ke mutabik afjaal ne ekbar khud ko gujarat kaa purv mukhyamantri shankar singh waghela bataakar ghaziabad kii dm ritu maheshwari par ek zamin vivaad ko kisi vyakti vishesh ke paksh main karne kii sifaarish kii thi
 Similarly, Afzal called himself Yashwant Sinha, a minister in the Atal Bihari Bajpai government and called the SSP of Ghaziabad and pressured him to do illegal work
 tru collar par farji naam se registershirsh adhikariyon ko rob main laane ke liye afjaal choudhary ne baqayada aparaadhiyon jaisi sajeesh rachi thi
 He got many fake sim issues and saved those sim numbers in the name of big leaders on the mobile app True Caller
 gujarat ke purv mukhyamantri shankar singh waghela or atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar main kendriya vitt mantri yashavanth sinha ke naam se bhi afjaal ne farji sim seve kar rakhe the
 Due to this, when the officers received a call from these numbers, they would come under pressure
 up-mukhyamantri tak ko phone kar banaaya dabaajaijaal choudhary kaa hausala itnaa bad chukaa tha ki usne ekbar yogi sarkaar main up mukhyamantri dinesh sharma tak ko phone kar adhikariyon kii kaam na karne kii shikaayat tak kar daali
 After this, when the Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharmane asked the SSP of Ghaziabad why he was not listening to Yashwant Sinha, the SSP suspected that the caller was fake
 gajiabad ke adhikariyon ko jab shaq hua to unhone chaanbin or puri hakeekat saamne aa gai
 When Afzal Chaudhary's reality reached Lucknow, Afzal Chaudhary was dismissed from the post of Member of the Commission

 Sports Minister Ajay Maken wants to bring the Bhartiya Cricket Board to the RTI Act, on which the BCCI today criticized him, saying that the minister is not aware of the ground realities that the board has already taken steps to bring transparency
 maakan ne isse pehle kaha tha ki vah bisisiai ko artiai ke daayre main laana chaahate hai or iske liye vah rashtriya khel vikaas vidheyak ke kuch praavdhaanon par bisisiai kii aapatti par bhi vichaar karne ko taiyaar hai
 BCCI vice-president Rajiv Shukla said that the board's accounts have become public through their website
 unhone kaha, ‚Äòmaakan ko pataa karnaa chahie ki jamini str par kya ho rahaa he
 They don't know anything
 sari soochna hamaari website par maujuud he
 That is why there is no question of hiding anything

 He said, 'the Finance Minister told Parliament yesterday that the BCCI had paid Rs 249 crore as tax
 hamaare sabhi padaadhikari maanad hai, stadium logon ke liye hai, mahasanghon ke liye nahin
 The officer is not the owner of the stadiums

 Input: IANS ek lambey intjaar ke baad centre sarkaar ne kaveri jal bantwaare ke mudde par supreme court main apana masauda pesh kar diya he
 During this time Water Resources Secretary UP Singh also appeared in the court
 maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne kaha ki ham is masaude ko thik karne main nahin ja sakate hai, lekin court ke aadeshaanusaar rajya or centre main talmail thik karvaa sakate hai
 The next hearing of the case will now be held on Wednesday
 centre kii ore se jo draft pesh kiya gaya he, use sambandhit rajyon ko diya jayega
 After which his suggestions will be sought
 buudhvaar ko hi teenon rajya apni raay or apana rukh supreme court main pesh karenge
 In the last hearing, the Supreme Court had asked UP Singh to be present, which is why he was present during the hearing on Monday
 court ne sunwaayee main centre se kaha he ki vah teenon rajyon se baatcheet kar skim ko taiyaar kare
 Now he will not hear again
 is par centre ne kaha he ki rajyon kii raay ke mutabik ham board, othirity yaa cameti banane ko taiyaar he
 The delay was due to the Karnataka elections
 The central government had sought more time from the Supreme Court to prepare a plan to implement the Cauvery water sharing decision
 sarkaar ne pichhali sunwaayee main kaha tha ki yojana kaa masauda taiyaar karne ke liye use or vakt chahie kyonki pradhanmantri sahit cabinet mantri sabhi karnataka chunaav main vyast hai
 The court had reprimanded
 The Supreme Court has already reprimanded the Central Government for not preparing a plan to implement the Cauvery water sharing decision
 court ne centre sarkaar se 3 may tak kaveri jal bantwaare kii yojana taiyaar karke dene kaa nirdesh diya tha
 But even today the government could not present any draft before the top court
 kaveri jal vivaad nyaayaadhikaran ke faisle ke anusaar masauda taiyaar kiya janaa he
 Information of SC-ST employees sought from private companies
 EPFO is sending mail to private companies
 Within 24 hours of receiving the mail, the government is asking for information from private companies that Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (in their establishment) ST) How many employees are there in the class
 kshetreey bhavishya nidhi (PF) karyaalayon ke dwaara dilli, bengalooru, chennai kii nijee form ko jaankaree dene ke liye i-mail bheja ja rahaa he or sari jaankaree mail milane ke 24 ghante ke bheetar dene ko kaha gaya he
 It is worth noting that many organizations have been demanding reservation in private companies, in such a situation, the demand for such data has again raised speculation as to why the government wants such information
 ek echaar kansaltent ne hamaare sahyogi prakaashan bijness today se is baat kii pushti kii he ki dilli or chennai kii kai companiyon ko pief offis se is tarah ke i-mail hasil hue hai
 However, the consultant said that his clients in Mumbai and Pune have said that no such match is received
 lekin dilli sthit ek echaar kansaltency ke founder ne bataaya ki bengalooru or chennai ke alaava dilli sthit uske client ko bhi aise i-mail hasil hue hai
 This notification does not pertain to any one sector or industry, rather it has been sent to all companies falling under a regional PF office
 puraa vivaran maangis mail se jaankaree maangi gai he ki pratishthan kaa naam, kul karmchaariyon kii sankhya, essi karmchaariyon kii sankhya or asti karmchaariyon kii sankhya bataaen
 The subject of the e-mail reads - 'furnishing of details of SC / ST employees' Employment in your establishment - Most earnest
 yani aapke pratishthan main niyukt essi / asti karmchaariyon kaa vivaran pesh karnaa-behad jaruri
 Business Today has a copy of this email
 yahi nahin, i-mail hasil karne vaali companiyon ko vivaran sirf ek din main yani 24 ghante ke bheetar dene ko kaha gaya he
 Difficult for companies: This combination has also made it difficult for companies, because most private companies do not have caste based figures of employees
 ek echaar head ne kaha, 'abhi yah shuruaati baat he, zyaadaatar companiyon ne mail ke jawaab main kaha he ki ve is tarah ke aankade nahin jutate or yah jaankaree dene ke liye unhen samay chahie
 The HR head of a grocery firm said that she had not received such a match, but now she will get the full details of the employees in her recruitment form itself
 patna city ke marunganj sarraafaa bazaar main bijepi kaa billaa lagaae ek puraane kaaryakarta se baat hi kar rahaa tha ki saamne kii dukaan se kai vyapaaree nikal aae

 vahaan se kisi tarah niklaa to haath main mike dekhakar kai logon ne roka ki ve nandakishor yadav ke bare main bolnaa chaahate hai
 Look at the condition of the area unhone kahaan koi kaam kiya he
 In Bindusar village adjacent to Siwan, Shahnawaz told that a meeting of the youth of the village has been called
 uske baad hi tay karenge ki kise vot karnaa he
 On asking the reason, Shahnawaz said, "hey sir, we are tagged as RJD voters
" is vajah se hamaare gaanv kii bijli ek number kii nahin hui he
 a number means a direct line from the city, which provides twenty hours of electricity
 aisa ladakon ne bataaya
 The BJP mps were saying that they would change the line if they voted
 sivaan se niklaa hi tha ki whats ap par kisi mitra ne bataaya ki arriya ke sikati vidhansabha main mumbai or dilli se aae 200 ladakon ke dal ne pichhadepan ko lekar matdaan ke bahishkaar kaa elaan kar rakhaa he
 The boys in Ara want to raise the issue of why recruitments are not coming out in the railway
 patna main kuch ladakon ne kaha ki ucch shiksha kii haalat acchhee nahin he
 Complaints about the quality of education were also heard in the villages
 kya in awaazon ko aap jativaadee khaanche main fit kar sakate hai? channelon ne aisi awaazon ko bhale jagah di, lekin kritrim set par jamaa kiye gaye sau-do sau logon ke hallaa hangaame main kho gai
 The spokesperson who is coming to mind is speaking
 log apana sawaal lekar aise kurta faad rahe he, jaise chikh dene se mudde kaa uth janaa ho gaya
 Political parties spent all their energy in cow and goat
 bihar kaa chunaav nateeja aane ke baad bhale hi rashtriya sandarbh main dekha or saraahaa jayega, lekin bihar ne ek shandaar mauqaa ganvaa diya
 It is not that the newspapers did not print public issues but the parties did nothing but show tact
 ve mudde chhapakar kabad main badal gaye
 Who was ready for debate on issues like education, medicine or malnutrition? Who will become the Chief Minister, every chair or part of the election is being restricted to programs of political type
 buniyadi muddon kii baat koi nahin kar rahaa
 ngos or neutral civic organizations become active as soon as elections come, but who listens
 aap kuposhan kii baat karte rahiye udhar public gomance jaise bhavuk muddon main vyast he
 The media raises, but the issues of health medicine do not become the main political discourse
 centre sarkaar kii shiksha niti se lekar rajya sarkaar kii shiksha niti main kya fark he ise hi lekar netaa gambhir nahin hai
 Some journalists and some people search for a place to raise their voice
 media, karporate, raajnneetik dal kaa ek complex ban chukaa he
 Even before, but it has been strengthened
 chunaav or chunaav kaa kawarej nautanki kaa part banakar rah gaya he
 It seems that no one is meant by the candidates of other areas
 donon dalon ke jite ummidavaaron ke kaam kii samiksha nahin hui
 People are angry with the mlas on both sides
 sthaneey vidhayakon kaa vidhaayi kaaryon main kya yogadan rahaa he, isaki to kabhi charchaa nahin hoti
 This time i changed my reporting
 jab buniyadi muddon ko chhod bhavukta muddon par hi chunaav ladaa janaa he to main samaaj ke bheetar sahjivan ke qisson ko khojane laga
 Began to find Bihar that is not understood by these strategists
 karodo rupee kaa helicopter udaakar netaa shaitan, narpishaach or gomance bolne ja rahe the 
 The election of Bihar becomes an attack on his identity
 yahaan ke sansadhano par niyantran rakhane vaala tabaqa bhi bheetar se hamalavar ho jaataa he jabaki shiksha or chikitsa kii haalat usee ne buree kii he
 Who should form a government, who will stop the robbery that is being done from patients in a nursing home outside Patna? Is that section ready to call it lootraj? Is the looter able to understand that if trapped in the caste, these robbers will get more leeway, because people of every caste are involved in this loot
 jab se chunaav prabandhan kaa khel ban gaya he, naqli mudde gadhe jane lage hai
 Copywriters are looking for a big issue and the leaders keep chanting it as the gita-quran
 aarakshan-aarakshan yaa gomance-gomance
 Large hoardings carry a leader and a slogan
 isse chunaav kii vividhta samaapt ho gai he
 It is good that people are preserving this diversity at their level
 ham media vaale hi chunaav main janata kii awaz ke prasarak nahin rahe
 Leaders do not give voice to those voices
 do sau rupaya kilo daal he or manchon par daal mudda nahin he
 People are troubled by alcohol and alcohol is not the issue
 janata kaa bada hissaa bhi isi tarah se prashikshit kar diya he ki koun jitegaa
 Who will be the Prime Minister or Chief Minister? subah-subah patna ke maurya hotel se nikal rahaa tha
 Two boys met
 selfi khinchaai or khud ko kisi akhbaar ke marketing kaa bataaya
 Both were going to meet the leader of a particular caste staying in the hotel
 ye netaa abhi-abhi ubhare hai
 i asked that if you are from marketing, why are you going to meet them
 ek ne jawaab dete hue kaha ki aapane falaan din ke falaan angreji akhbaar main wo news item nahin dekha tha? main chup rahaa
 The boy said that we had given that idea to Netaji
 unke bolne ke baad hi chapa he
 Today we are going to give another issue
 dekhie, agar use lete hai to khabar ban sakati he
 The comments ab sochie netaa ko mudda koun de rahaa he? mudda, mudda nahin ek idia bhar he
 i continued to show the plight of the labor settlements in the Delhi elections
 logon kii haalat bahut kharaab he, lekin kisi bhi dal ne apane menifesto main use jagah nahin di
 Did not speak honestly and did not present a blue print to the public
 har chunaav main avaidh colony ko niyamit karne kaa drama hota he
 The one who has government at the center issues an order
 baad main sab zero
 Still, there was praise from the public for going there and raising the issue, but i often wonder why those issues could not become political discussions? When it is not made, why should it be done and for how long? All seem to be for personal hobbies
 jagaane ke naam par kise jagaa rahe hai? kise kya nahin maaloom he or nahin maaloom he to usne jaanane kaa kya prayaas kiya? After spending crores of rupees, political parties get printed in the newspapers with personal attacks
 jatigat netaaon ke vigyaapan har din akhabaaron ke pehle panne par chape
 We should think why the political parties did not publish such advertisements that what are they going to do about health? What have you done? duusari taraf maine logon ko bhi dekha ki ve in muddon ko chhod alag-alag kaarnon se dalon se dil lagaae baithe hai
 Is it that Bihar has lost the opportunity? He is angry with the MLA but will vote because his party of choice should win
 to jeet kaa mazaa lijie
 The defeat that is hidden in this victory will be disenchanted after the election
 sivaan se sate bindusaar gaanv main shahanwaaz ne bataaya ki gaanv ke naujavaanon kii baithak bulaai he
 Only then will we decide who to vote for
 kaaran poochne par shahanwaaz ne kaha ki are sar, ham logon par rajd ke voter hone kaa tag lag gaya he
 Due to this, the number of electricity in our village has not been reached
 ek number matlab shahar se diarect line, jisase bees ghante bijli milti he
 The boys said this
 kehane laga ki bijepi ke saansad kah rahe hai ki vot dene par line change kara denge
 It was from Siwan that a friend told on whatsapp that a team of 200 boys from Mumbai and Delhi in Araria's Sikti assembly has declared a boycott vote for backwardness
 aara main ladke yah mudda uthaanaa chaahate hai ki railway main bhartiyon kyon nahin nikal rahi hai
 Some boys in Patna said that the condition of higher education is not good
 gaanvon main bhi shiksha kii gunvattta ko lekar shikaayatein sunne ko milin
 Can you fit these voices in the casteist groove? The channels may have given place to such voices, but the chaos of the hundred or two hundred people who were deposited on the artificial set was lost in the uproar
 pravaktaa jo man main aa rahaa he bol rahe hai
 People are tearing their kurta with their question, as if the issue has arisen due to screaming
 raajnneetik dalon ne apni sari urja gaay or bakrii main kharch kar di
 After the election results of Bihar will be seen and appreciated in the national context, but Bihar has lost a great opportunity
 aisa nahin he ki akhabaaron ne janata ke mudde nahin chaape balki partiyon ne chaturaai dikhaane ke alaava kuch nahin kiya
 Those issues were printed and turned into junk
 shiksha chikitsa yaa kuposhan jaise masalon par koun bahes ke liye taiyaar tha? har chunaav ko koun banegaa mukhyamantri, qissa kursi kaa yaa satta kaa rajtilak tip ke kaaryakramon tak simit kar diya ja rahaa he
 Nobody is talking about basic issues
 chunaav aate hi enjio yaa tatasth naagarik sanghathan sakriy ho jate hai, lekin sunata koun he

 media uthaata to he, lekin swasthya chikitsa ke mudde mukhya raajnneetik vimarsh nahin ban pate
 The leaders are not serious about the difference between the education policy of the central government and the education policy of the state government
 kuch patrkaar or kuch log awaz uthaane kii jagah khojate rahete hai
 The media has become a complex of corporate, political parties
 pehle bhi tha, lekin ye majboot hua he
 Election and election coverage have become part of the gimmick
 aisa lag rahaa he ki kisi ko baaki kshetron keummidavaar se matlab hi nahin
 The work of the winning candidates of both the parties was not reviewed

 When elections were to be contested on sentimentality issues, except for basic issues, i began to look for examples of symbiosis within the society
 us bihar ko khojane laga jo in ranneetikaron kii samaj se baahar he
 The leaders were going to speak Satan, malevolent and beef by blowing a helicopter of crores of rupees
 bihar kaa chunaav uski pahchaan par hamale kaa mauqaa ban jaataa he
 The area that controls the resources here also gets attacked from within, whereas the condition of education and medicine has worsened
 kisi kii sarkaar bane, patna ke baahar bane nursing home main marizon se jo lut ho rahi he wo koun band karegaa? kya wo tabaqa ise luutraj kehane ke liye taiyaar he? kya jo lut rahaa he wo samaj paa rahaa he ki jati main fanse to in luteron ko or bhi chhot milegi, kyonki is lut main har jati ke log shaamil hai
 Ever since election management has become a game, fake issues are being created
 copiriter kisi ek bade mudde kii talash main rahete hai or netaa use hi gita-quran maanakar chunaav bhar japate rahete hai
 Reservation-reservation or beef-beef
 bade-bade hording par ek netaa or ek naaraa hota he
 This has eliminated the diversity of elections
 acha he ki log apane str par is vividhta ko bachaae hue hai
 We, the media, were not broadcasters of public voice in the elections
 netaa un awaazon ko jagah nahin dete
 Two hundred rupees a kilo is pulses and pulses are not an issue on forums
 log sharaab se pareshaan he or sharaab mudda nahin he
 Large sections of the public have also been trained in the same way as to who will win
 koun pradhanmantri yaa mukhyamantri banegaa? Morning was leaving from Patna's Maurya Hotel
 do ladke mili
 Took selfie and told myself about marketing a newspaper
 donon hotel main tehre ek jati vishesh ke netaa se milane ja rahe the
 These leaders have just emerged
 maine poocha ki aap marketing ke hai to inase kyon milane ja rahe hai
 One replied that you did not see that news item in such and such English newspaper of the day
 i remained silent
 ladke ne kaha ki wo idia hamane hi netaa ji ko diya tha
 It is printed only after he speaks
 aaj ham log ek or mudda dene ja rahe hai
 See, if you take it then news can be made
 tippaniyan Now think who is giving the issue to the leader? The issue is more than an idea
 main dilli chunaav main vahaan kii mazdoor bastiyon kii durdasha dikhaata rahaa
 The condition of the people is very bad, but no party gave it a place in their manifesto
 eemaandaaree se baat nahin kii or ek blue print janata ke saamne pesh nahin kiya
 There is a drama in every election to regularize illegal colony
 centre main jisaki sarkaar hoti he wo ek aadesh jari kar detaa he
 Sub zero later
 phir bhi vahaan jaakar apni taraf se mudda uthaane ke liye janata se shaabaashi jarur mili, lekin aksar sochataa hum ki ve mudde raajnneetik vimarsh kyon nahin ban paae? jab banate hi nahin hai to kyon kiya jaae or kab tak kiya jaae? sab lagata he ki vyaktigat shauq ke liye kar rahe hai
 Who is awakening in the name of wake up? Who does not know and does not know, so what did he try to know? karodon rupee kharch kar raajnneetik dal vyaktigat hamale vaale matter akhabaaron main chhapavate hai
 Advertisements of caste leaders appeared on the front page of newspapers every day
 hamen sochna chahie ki raajnneetik dalon ne aisa vigyaapan kyon nahin chapa ki health ko lekar kya-kya kaam karne vaale hai? kya-kya kiya he
 On the other hand, i also saw people leaving these issues and keeping their hearts out to the parties for different reasons
 kahin aisa to nahin ki bihar ne mauqaa ganvaa diya? wo vidhayak se naaraaz hai lekin vot denge kyonki uski pasand kii party jeetni chahie
 So enjoy the victory
 is jeet main jo haar chhipi he wo chunaav ke baad mohabhang main nazar aegi
 It was from Siwan that a friend told on whatsapp that a team of 200 boys from Mumbai and Delhi in Araria's Sikti assembly has declared a boycott vote for backwardness
 aara main ladke yah mudda uthaanaa chaahate hai ki railway main bhartiyon kyon nahin nikal rahi hai
 Some boys in Patna said that the condition of higher education is not good
 gaanvon main bhi shiksha kii gunvattta ko lekar shikaayatein sunne ko milin
 Can you fit these voices in the casteist groove? The channels may have given place to such voices, but the chaos of the hundred or two hundred people who were deposited on the artificial set was lost in the uproar
 pravaktaa jo man main aa rahaa he bol rahe hai
 People are tearing their kurta with their question, as if the issue has arisen due to screaming
 raajnneetik dalon ne apni sari urja gaay or bakrii main kharch kar di
 After the election results of Bihar will be seen and appreciated in the national context, but Bihar has lost a great opportunity
 aisa nahin he ki akhabaaron ne janata ke mudde nahin chaape balki partiyon ne chaturaai dikhaane ke alaava kuch nahin kiya
 Those issues were printed and turned into junk
 shiksha chikitsa yaa kuposhan jaise masalon par koun bahes ke liye taiyaar tha? har chunaav ko koun banegaa mukhyamantri, qissa kursi kaa yaa satta kaa rajtilak tip ke kaaryakramon tak simit kar diya ja rahaa he
 Nobody is talking about basic issues
 chunaav aate hi enjio yaa tatasth naagarik sanghathan sakriy ho jate hai, lekin sunata koun he

 is jeet main jo haar chhipi he wo chunaav ke baad mohabhang main nazar aegi
 Who was ready for debate on issues like education, medicine or malnutrition? Who will become the Chief Minister, every chair or part of the election is being restricted to programs of political type
 buniyadi muddon kii baat koi nahin kar rahaa
 ngos or neutral civic organizations become active as soon as elections come, but who listens
 aap kuposhan kii baat karte rahiye udhar public gomance jaise bhavuk muddon main vyast he
 The media raises, but the issues of health medicine do not become the main political discourse
 centre sarkaar kii shiksha niti se lekar rajya sarkaar kii shiksha niti main kya fark he ise hi lekar netaa gambhir nahin hai
 Some journalists and some people search for a place to raise their voice
 media, karporate, raajnneetik dal kaa ek complex ban chukaa he
 Even before, but it has been strengthened
 chunaav or chunaav kaa kawarej nautanki kaa part banakar rah gaya he
 It seems that no one is meant by the candidates of other areas
 donon dalon ke jite ummidavaaron ke kaam kii samiksha nahin hui
 People are angry with the mlas on both sides
 sthaneey vidhayakon kaa vidhaayi kaaryon main kya yogadan rahaa he, isaki to kabhi charchaa nahin hoti
 This time i changed my reporting
 jab buniyadi muddon ko chhod bhavukta muddon par hi chunaav ladaa janaa he to main samaaj ke bheetar sahjivan ke qisson ko khojane laga
 Began to find Bihar that is not understood by these strategists
 karodo rupee kaa helicopter udaakar netaa shaitan, narpishaach or gomance bolne ja rahe the 
 The election of Bihar becomes an attack on his identity
 yahaan ke sansadhano par niyantran rakhane vaala tabaqa bhi bheetar se hamalavar ho jaataa he jabaki shiksha or chikitsa kii haalat usee ne buree kii he
 Who should form a government, who will stop the robbery that is being done from patients in a nursing home outside Patna? Is that section ready to call it lootraj? Is the looter able to understand that if trapped in the caste, these robbers will get more leeway, because people of every caste are involved in this loot
 jab se chunaav prabandhan kaa khel ban gaya he, naqli mudde gadhe jane lage hai
 Copywriters are looking for a big issue and the leaders keep chanting it as the gita-quran
 aarakshan-aarakshan yaa gomance-gomance
 Large hoardings carry a leader and a slogan
 isse chunaav kii vividhta samaapt ho gai he
 It is good that people are preserving this diversity at their level
 ham media vaale hi chunaav main janata kii awaz ke prasarak nahin rahe
 Leaders do not give voice to those voices
 do sau rupaya kilo daal he or manchon par daal mudda nahin he
 People are troubled by alcohol and alcohol is not the issue
 janata kaa bada hissaa bhi isi tarah se prashikshit kar diya he ki koun jitegaa
 Who will be the Prime Minister or Chief Minister? subah-subah patna ke maurya hotel se nikal rahaa tha
 Two boys met
 selfi khinchaai or khud ko kisi akhbaar ke marketing kaa bataaya
 Both were going to meet the leader of a particular caste staying in the hotel
 ye netaa abhi-abhi ubhare hai
 i asked that if you are from marketing, why are you going to meet them
 ek ne jawaab dete hue kaha ki aapane falaan din ke falaan angreji akhbaar main wo news item nahin dekha tha? main chup rahaa
 The boy said that we had given that idea to Netaji
 unke bolne ke baad hi chapa he
 Today we are going to give another issue
 dekhie, agar use lete hai to khabar ban sakati he
 The comments ab sochie netaa ko mudda koun de rahaa he? mudda, mudda nahin ek idia bhar he
 i continued to show the plight of the labor settlements in the Delhi elections
 logon kii haalat bahut kharaab he, lekin kisi bhi dal ne apane menifesto main use jagah nahin di
 Did not speak honestly and did not present a blue print to the public
 har chunaav main avaidh colony ko niyamit karne kaa drama hota he
 The one who has government at the center issues an order
 baad main sab zero
 Still, there was praise from the public for going there and raising the issue, but i often wonder why those issues could not become political discussions? When it is not made, why should it be done and for how long? All seem to be for personal hobbies
 jagaane ke naam par kise jagaa rahe hai? kise kya nahin maaloom he or nahin maaloom he to usne jaanane kaa kya prayaas kiya? After spending crores of rupees, political parties get printed in the newspapers with personal attacks
 jatigat netaaon ke vigyaapan har din akhabaaron ke pehle panne par chape
 We should think why the political parties did not publish such advertisements that what are they going to do about health? What have you done? duusari taraf maine logon ko bhi dekha ki ve in muddon ko chhod alag-alag kaarnon se dalon se dil lagaae baithe hai
 Is it that Bihar has lost the opportunity? He is angry with the MLA but will vote because his party of choice should win
 to jeet kaa mazaa lijie
 The defeat that is hidden in this victory will be disenchanted after the election
 aisa lag rahaa he ki kisi ko baaki kshetron keummidavaar se matlab hi nahin

 Who will be the Prime Minister or Chief Minister? subah-subah patna ke maurya hotel se nikal rahaa tha
 Two boys met
 selfi khinchaai or khud ko kisi akhbaar ke marketing kaa bataaya
 Both were going to meet the leader of a particular caste staying in the hotel
 ye netaa abhi-abhi ubhare hai
 i asked that if you are from marketing, why are you going to meet them
 ek ne jawaab dete hue kaha ki aapane falaan din ke falaan angreji akhbaar main wo news item nahin dekha tha? main chup rahaa
 The boy said that we had given that idea to Netaji
 unke bolne ke baad hi chapa he
 Today we are going to give another issue
 dekhie, agar use lete hai to khabar ban sakati he
 The comments ab sochie netaa ko mudda koun de rahaa he? mudda, mudda nahin ek idia bhar he
 i continued to show the plight of the labor settlements in the Delhi elections
 logon kii haalat bahut kharaab he, lekin kisi bhi dal ne apane menifesto main use jagah nahin di
 Did not speak honestly and did not present a blue print to the public
 har chunaav main avaidh colony ko niyamit karne kaa drama hota he
 The one who has government at the center issues an order
 baad main sab zero
 Still, there was praise from the public for going there and raising the issue, but i often wonder why those issues could not become political discussions? When it is not made, why should it be done and for how long? All seem to be for personal hobbies
 jagaane ke naam par kise jagaa rahe hai? kise kya nahin maaloom he or nahin maaloom he to usne jaanane kaa kya prayaas kiya? After spending crores of rupees, political parties get printed in the newspapers with personal attacks
 jatigat netaaon ke vigyaapan har din akhabaaron ke pehle panne par chape
 We should think why the political parties did not publish such advertisements that what are they going to do about health? What have you done? duusari taraf maine logon ko bhi dekha ki ve in muddon ko chhod alag-alag kaarnon se dalon se dil lagaae baithe hai
 Is it that Bihar has lost the opportunity? He is angry with the MLA but will vote because his party of choice should win

 The defeat that is hidden in this victory will be disenchanted after the election

 On the other hand, i also saw people leaving these issues and keeping their hearts out to the parties for different reasons

 Amidst the headlines of CBI vs CBI, Congress has launched a big attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 congress ne aarope lagaaya he ki sibiai ko tabah karne ke liye pradhanmantri modi jimmedaar hai
 Head of the Congress's Communications Department, Randeep Singh Surjewalane said in a press conference, "the Prime Minister is the only one responsible for demolishing and destroying India's premier investigative agency CBI
" sansthaaon kii ninda karnaa, avmaananaa, dhahaana or tabah karnaa hi piem modi kaa iklauta agenda he
 "this is not the first time that the government is under attack from the CBI
" upie sarkaarake kaarykaal main bhi 2013 main sibiai ko supreme court kii sakht tippanee kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 The Supreme Court had then called the CBI a parrot imprisoned in a 'panjre' who speaks the voice of its owner
 ‚Äôaise aarope pehle bhi lagate rahe hai ki vipaksh ke netaaon par dawaab banane ke liye sibiai kaa istemaal centre kii sarkaron kii ore se kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Surjewala said, 'CBI has been retained as bjp's dirty tricks department
 pradhanmantri modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah adatan sibiai kaa istemaal apane raajnneetik virodhiyon ke khilaaf kar rahe hai
 Also, illegal interference is being done to influence the fair investigation of serious criminal cases
 in sab baton ne sibiai ko bade jhamele main tabdeel karke rakh diya he
 'congress has also asked Prime Minister Modi three questions
 1
 Why did the Prime Minister invite the CBI chief and the Chief of Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) to his residence last night? Was it to influence the ongoing corruption investigation against CBI and RAW officials? Was this not equal to the illegal and unconstitutional interference of the Prime Minister in the investigation of corruption charges against the highly placed officials of the two agencies? 2
 kya kendriya satarkta ayog (CVC) kii bhoomika khud badalon se nahin ghiri he? sivisi kyon galat kaamon ko nishpaksh or nirnaayak dhang se dandit karne ke sanvidhanik daayitv se peeche hat rahaa he? kya sivisi ko bhi raajnneetik kaaryakarini se koi nirdesh de rahaa he?3
 Is the Prime Minister not systematically destroying all premier agencies? These agencies include CBI, ED, SFIO, CBDT, NIA, Income Tax Department and others
 congress kii ore se 6 aise maukon kaa bhi hawala diya gaya, jahaan kathith taur par modi sarkaar kii ore se sibiai kii sanstha kaa durupyog kiya gaya
 Surjewala claimed, 'there are hidden doubts about the role of the top level of the current political executive and two senior CBI officers
 ‚Äôsurajevaala ne in chah ghatnaon kaa hawala diya
 A
 puure vyaapman ghotaale ko dabaa dena or madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko clin chit dena
 B
 mehul chokasee or neerav modi kii sanliptata vaale 26,306 karod rupee ke bank lut ghotaale main bhi aise hi sawaal uthe
 In May 2018, Rajiv Singh, joint director of cbi's Bank Securities and Fraud Sales, was abruptly transferred to the country
 C
 An even bigger puzzle was the sudden transfer of Special Crimes Deputy Director Neena Singh and recalling two CBI officers - Aneesh Prasad, DIG and k Gopalakrishna Rao, SP
 ye sabhi neerav modi-mehul chokasee ghotaale, reyaan skool murder cese or shimla rape cese kii jaanch kar rahe the
 D
 godhra esaiti main ek khaas adhikari jisaki bhoomika ko lekar lagaataar sanshay rahe, use sibiai main laayaa gaya
 E
 4 agast 2018 ko puraa desh hairaan rah gaya jab sibiai ke ek varisht adhikari ko landan kii british court main bhagode vijay maalya se baat karte or haath milaate dekha gaya
 F
 ye tathy or aashcharya main daalane vaala he ki ek varisht adhikari jo philhal piemo main tainaat he, or jisaki kathith taur par koyala ghotaale main abhiyojyata he, use raajnneetik kaaryakarini main se kisi ne sibiai par dabaav daalkar aaropee kii jagah gavaah bana diya
 The truth of these serious allegations, which are related to the PMO, were never investigated and suppressed
 surajevaala ne aakhir main kaha, ‚Äòpradhanmantri or sheersh sattadhariyon ne sibiai ko bijepi kaa darty tricks department bana diya he
 ED, Income Tax Department, CBDT, SFIO, NIA are other entities being used as bjp's dirty tricks department of 'hostage puppets'
 ‚Äô Union Minister Jairam Ramesh termed the Maoists as terrorists who killed several Congress leaders in Chhattisgarh four days ago and hoped that this massacre, deliberately and planned, would prove to be a turning point in the fight against them
 gramin vikaas mantri ne kaha ki maovadiyon ko lekar romani nahin hona chaiye kyonki ve aatankwaadi hai jo aatank failaate hai
 He was talking about the killing of 27 people, including the Congress president of Chhattisgarh and some other party leaders, in the Saturday attack
 aamtaur par maovadiyon ke khilaaf sakht rukh akhriyaar karne ke virdohi rahane vaale ramesh ne kaha ki maovadiyon ko samvidhan, loktantr yaa loktantric sansthaanon par koi aasthaa nahin he
 They do not have Maoism based on any ideology but it is based on ransom
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar kii ranneeti se peeche nahin hataa ja saktaa jo suraksha or police karrwai tathaa raajnneetik samvaad ko centre main rakhe hue hai
 Development plans will have to be worked out to address tribal development issues
 ramesh ne kaha, ‚Äò2004 se lekar abhi tak ham kah rahe hai ki yah kanoon vyavastha kaa mudda he or saath hi yah saamaajik aarthik mudda bhi he
 Will have to solve both ways
 ‚Äô unhone maovadiyon ko aade haath lete hue kaha, ‚Äòve aatankwaadi hai
 No matter what they are? You cannot be soft on them
 ve bhay failaa rahe hai
 They are spreading terror
 ‚Äôramesh ne kaha ki shanivaar kii ghatana sirf ek hatyakand nahin he
 It is a genocide with extreme cruelty
 isse raajnneetik sanket judaa hua he
 Describing the message behind this attack, he said that he thinks it is a sign that the Maoists want to tell the Congress and other political parties, 'these are free zones, don't come here, your political dialogue will not work , Your gram sabha will not run and there will be no rallies
 ‚Äô unhone kaha ki yah bharat main asweekaarya sthiti he
 He said that if the Maoists had such confidence in themselves, why would they not participate in the election process? Ramesh said that the poor tribals are trapped between the guns of the Maoists and the security forces

 das july ko, mumbai se sirf 140 kilometre dur, abhinetri laila khan ke igatpuri farmahouse ke pichhawaade main mumbai police ne chah kankal khoj nikaale
 Despite having visited this farmhouse twice before, it took him 17 months to find the skeleton
 laila or paanch sadasyon kaa uskaa parivaar farvari 2011 ke baad se laapata tha
 The police were also not vigilant when part of the house was destroyed in a June 2011 fire and furniture in the farmhouse reached nearby houses
 use laila kii do persian billiyon main se ek ko dekhakar bhi shaq nahin hua, jinhen vah hameshaa apane saath le jaati thi
 The Jammu and Kashmir police took the initiative to locate 30-year-old Parvez Tak, the third husband of the main accused and Laila's mother, Shelina Patel, when Laila's car was found in the garage of Tak's father in Kishtwar, Jammu and Kashmir
 jammu-kashmir police ne use nepal main dhund nikaala, jahaan vah chipa hua tha, use naukari dilaane kaa laalach dekar waapas bula liya
 Tak told the Kashmir police that Laila was killed by Shelina's second husband Asif Sheikh
 lekin jab mumbai police ne usase poochtacha kii to taak ne kabool kiya ki usne or uske sahyogi shakir 'san vaani ne unki hatya kar di
 Tak told Mumbai Police Crime Branch officials that she had taken Laila, 29, her 50-year-old mother Shelina, Laila's 31-year-old sister Ajamina, 22-year-old twin siblings Zara and Imran, and 23-year-old cousin Reshma to Laila's farmhouse
 Was killed on February 9, 2011
 shelina or laila usase mehmaanon ko pani dene or honda city, mitsubishi tathaa scorpiyo jaisi apni gaadiyaan chalaane ko kahati thim jisase vah apamaanit mahasoos karata tha
 Tak allegedly felt cheated when Shelina announced a plan to settle her property in Dubai, named Power of Attorney Sheikh
 sanyukt police ayukta (krime) himanshu roy ne kaha ki taak ne sampatti par vivaad ke kaaran sabase pehle shelina kii hatya kii
 Roy then said, "tak then killed Imran and Zara, who had come to meet him
" phir vaani kii madad se dusron kii hatya kar di
 Police believe Tak was motivated by greed
 shelina, laila or ajamina oshivada main ek flats or ek kapade kii dukaan, mira road main ek flats or igatpuri main ek farmahouse kii maalik thim
 The total value of this property is 6 crores
 thi
 The skeletons will be confirmed only after DNA testing
 roy ne kaha, ''hamane forensik visheshgyon se laila ke pita nadir shah patel or shelina kii bahanon ke diene namoonay lene or kankal ke diene ke saath unka milan karne ke liye kaha he
 The DNA test report is expected later this month
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki laila ke pita dwaara in logon kii gumshudagi kii shikaayat darj karne ke chah maheene baad, sitambar 2011 main, oshivada police maamle kii jaanch ke liye laila ke sunshine apartment pahunchi
 The police station is barely 100 meters away from this apartment block
 patel kii bahan albana patel or shelina kii bahan meher akhtar ne agast 2011 main hi police ko khabar kar di thi ki shelina ne farvari ke baad se unase sampark nahin kiya he, phir bhi police ko kisi gadabadi kaa andeh nahin hua
 In September 2011, Meher requested the police to search the farmhouse but the police ignored it
 itnaa hi nahin, disambar 2011 main laila kii 2008 kii film vafa ke nirmaataa rakesh saavant ne bhi gumshudagi kii shikaayat darj karai
 The police sent them back saying that their complaint had been lodged
 janvari main, laila ke pita ne aarope lagaaya ki shaikh or taak ne parivaar ko maarane kii sajeesh kii he
 The police still did not take any action
 police neend se tab jaagi, jab media ne aatankwaadi sanghathan lashkar-e-taiyaba ke saath laila ke sambhavit sambandhon ke bare main atakalon ko chhapana shuru kar diya
 a Mumbai tabloid newspaper reported that Laila was in Dubai and her Mitsubishi car was used in the September 2011 bombings outside the Delhi High Court
 jammu kshetra ke police mahanireekshak garib das ne is report se turant inkaar kar diya
 But the Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS) noticed this and sent a team to Kashmir in search of Laila and Tak
 unhen aatankwaad kaa pahalu to najar nahin aayaa, lekin unki karrwai ke kaaran laila media ke liye mudda ban gai or is saal march ke ant main police ko uski talash shuru kerani padi
 Former Mumbai Police Commissioner M
 en
 Singh defends the police, saying that unless a disturbance is suspected, the police do not take missing complaints about an adult seriously
 unhone india today se kaha, ''police par pehle hi bahut boj he
 The police cannot find every missing person
 laila ke maamle main, puraa parivaar shelina ke tathakthith pati ke saath tha
 They had left their homes themselves and there was no reason to believe that they might have been killed
 '' ve maanate hai ki laila kii khoj ke maamle main media ne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai he
 He says, "tak wanted accused in other cases
 laila ke maamle main vah shaq ke daayre main tab aayaa, jab media ne use sandigdh ke taur par pesh kiya
 Generally, the police report the missing person to the Missing Persons Bureau, which issues a lookout notice
 police aspataalon, shavgruhon or yahaan tak ki apane khud ke lock-ap tak main gumshuda logon kii talash karti he
 If anyone is found, relatives are informed
 gumshuda vyaktiyon ke beuro ke aankadon ke anusaar, mumbai main ausat 28 log rojaanaa gum hote hai
 The recovery of the skeleton in Laila's farmhouse has broken her 85-year-old grandmother Kneez Fatma, who lives on Mira Road, on the outskirts of Mumbai
 ve rote hue kahati hai, ''parvej ne mere chote bacchon ko kyon maar diya? unki kya galati thi?'' albana kahati hai, ''parvej ne hamen bataaya tha ki vah bahut majahabi he or use pasand nahin tha ki uski 'patni' or 'betiyaan' filmon main abhinay karen
 We made a mistake by believing in him
 '' laila kii rishte kii bahan mehanaj najim kahati hai ki parivaar ko sadame se ubarne main bahut samay lagegaa
 The case of the death of Sara Singh, the bride of former UP minister Amarmani Tripathi, is going on

 After this there was doubt about the death

 It has been given the appearance of a road accident
 vah is maamle ko lekar rajyapal ke rajyapal ram nik or police mahanideshak jagmohan yadav se bhi mulaakaat kar chuki hai

 -piem ne congress netritv par hamalaa kiya or kaha ki congress ke netaaon kii yah pravriti rahi he
 In this trend, the constitutional institutions of the country are forced to stand with their hands in front of the party and try to break those who do not bow down
 piem ne kaha ki ye unki rajshahi soch he jo unhen nishpaksh sansthaaon ko barbaad karne ko uksaati rahati he
 The PM said that recently we saw how he tried to bring impeachment motion against the Supreme Justice of the Judiciary
 piem modi ke mutabik jajon ko draane dhamkaane kii ye koshish unki puraani soch kaa hissaa rahi he
 -PM Modi said that who can know this better than the people of Prayagraj and UP why Congress does not like judiciary? Narendra Modi said that the people of UP should remember the days when the supreme leader of this party acted here to humiliate public opinion? Was this not an insult to democracy? -the government is trying its best to show the world a glimpse of India's glorious past and a glorious future: PM modi-central Government, working with Uttar Pradesh government to ensure that It is said that these events should be scenic, philosophical and divine: about 150 ghats are to be beautified in PM modi-namami-gange project
 isamen se kareeb 50 ghaaton kaa kaam puraa ho gaya he: piem modi-aaj jo projects kaa locarpan hua he usamen gangaji kii safai or yahaan ke ghaaton ke sundarikaran se jude anek projects bhi shaamil hai: piem modi-1700 karod rupye kii laagat se bane sivej-treetment plants se shahar ke kareeb ek darjan naalon ko sidhe ganga ji main bahane se roka ja sakegaa: piem modi-sarkaar kaa prayaas he ki is baar ardhakumbh main tap se takanic tak ke har pahalu kaa anubhav duniyabar ke logon ko mil sake: piem modi- aadhyatm, aasthaa or aadhuniktaa kii triveni kitni bhavy or bejod ho sakati he, iskaa anubhav lekar log yahaan se jaaen, isaki koshish kii ja rahi he: piem modi-sarkaar ne kumbh ke dauraan connectivati se lekar yahaan ke infrastracchar par vishesh dhyaan diya he
 Keeping the Kumbh in mind, the Railway Ministry is going to run many new trains this time as well: PM Modi - this time all devotees will be able to have darshan of Akshayavat
 kai pidiyon se ye akshayavat kile main band tha
 But this time every devotee who comes here after bathing will be able to get the fortune of Akshayavat: PM Modi this time all the devotees will be able to see Akshayavat

 com / x5mnujcfsx‚Äî BJP (@bjp4india)december 16, 2018- tap, tapasya, samskruti, sanskaar kii dharti tirthraj prayag ke jan-jan ko meraa sadar pranaam: piem modi- piem modi yahaan par kai yojanaon kaa locarpan karne ke baad jansabha ko sambodhit kar rahe hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Rae Bareli, the stronghold of former Congress President Sonia Gandhi, before the attack on Congress from Gandhi family stronghold
 upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi tathaa unase pehle bhi nehru-gandhi parivaar kaa raajnneetik durg rahe raibareli kaa piem modi kaa yah pehla daura tha
 On reaching Rae Bareli, PM Modi inspected the Modern Coach Factory
 pradhanmantri ne yahaan par 1100 karod kii pariyojnaon kaa locarpan tathaa shilanyas kiya
 PM Modi then addressed a public meeting here
 is dauraan piem modi ne congress par joardaar hamalaa bolaa
 Speaking on the defense deal, PM Modi said that the Congress never allowed the Air Force to become stronger
 raksha saude ke maamle main congress kaa itihaas kwatrochi mamaa kaa rahaa or kuch din pehle ek or aaropee mishael chachaa ko laayaa gaya he or hamane dekha he ki congress kaise inako bachaane ke liye apana vakil adaalat main bheji
 Is the Congress angry because Quattrocchi Mama and Michelle Uncle are not in the defense deal that the BJP government is doing
 kya kaha piem modi ne-beete kuch samay se karjamaafee ko lekar bhi congress badi-badi baaten kar rahi he
 In Karnataka, the Congress promised farmers a loan waiver
 sirf 10 din kii baat kahi gai thi lekin aaj 6 maheene baad sachai kuch or he: piem modi-congress kaa echosystem aapako kabhi nahin batayega ki sirf is faisle se desh ke kisaanon ko 60 hajaar karod rupye milanaa tay hua he: piem modi-endie sarkaar ne kisaanon kii aay badhaane ke liye MSP par swaminathan cameti kii report ko lagu kiya
 MSP has been ensured on 22 crops of Kharif and Rabi: What is the answer to the PM modi-congress that when she remained in power for ten years, why did she not implement the Swaminathan Committee report? The Congress will never answer this nor will its eco-system ever ask for this answer: In 2016, after PM Modi-our government was formed at the Center, we bought 50 thousand bulletproof jackets for the army
 main desh ko ye bhi jaankaree dena chahta hum ki is saal april main puri 1 lakh 86 hajaar bullate pruf jacket kaa order diya ja chukaa he
 This jacket is being made by an Indian company
 - 2009 main bhartiya sena ne 1 lakh 86 hajaar bullate pruf jacket kii maang kii thi
 Five years passed from 2009 to 2014, but no bulletproof jacket was purchased for the army: PM modi-congress did not allow the Air Force to become stronger
 raksha saude ke maamle main congress kaa itihaas kwatrochi mamaa kaa rahaa or kuch din pehle ek or aaropee mishael chachaa ko laayaa gaya he or hamane dekha he ki congress ne kaise inako bachaane ke liye apana vakil adaalat main bhej di
 Is the Congress angry because Quattrocchi Mama and Michelle Uncle are not in the defense deal that the BJP government is doing
 hamaare liye hameshaa dal se bada desh he
 PM Modi - Today the country has two sides, one side is of truth, of safety
 doosraa paksh un takaton kaa he jo kisi bhi keemat par desh ko kamjor karnaa chaahate hai
 The Congress stands with those forces that do not want to allow our forces to be strong, the country is watching the efforts of such people from which countries are getting support
 bhaashan yahaan diya jaataa he or taaliyaan pakistan main bajati hai
 For some, the Ministry of Defense is a liar, the Minister of Defense is a liar, some people also see the Court as a liar, the truth does not need to be adorned and the truth is not known in what they say: PM Modi - today i am proud to say Is realizing that in the coming time, Rae Bareli is going to become a global hub in terms of rail coach manufacturing: PM Modi - Not only this, in 2014 we also saw that in the coach factory here A
 There was also no new appointment
 ab aaj kii sthiti ye he ki lagbhag 2 hajaar nae karmchaariyon ko hamaari sarkaar ne niyukt kiya he:piem modi-jab pehle kii sarkaar ne yahaan par rail coach factory kaa nirmaan tay kiya tha, to ye tay hua tha ki 5000 karmchaariyon kii niyukti kii jaaegi
 But only half of its posts were approved: PM Modi - If the capacity of the coach factory increases, then all kinds of jobs will increase for the youth here
 us din ke bare main sochie, jab yahaan har roj 10-12 nae coach banane lagenge: piem modi-debh bhar ke metro ke dibbe raibareli ke coach factory main banenge: piem modi-ye factory 2007 main sweekrut hui thi
 In 2010, this factory was also ready, but after 4 years, the factory was made to take cans from Kapurthala to tighten and paint them: PM Modi - the factory which was to make new cans, was never fully capable Not allowed to work: PM Modi- Before coming here, i was in the modern coach factory nearby
 maine us factory main is varsh bane 900wein dibbe ko hari jhandi bhi dikhaai
 Raibareli's Rail Coach Factory is also a witness to what has been the culture of earlier governments: PM modi-pm Modi dedicates 900th coach and Humsafar Rake to the nation
 Dedicated the country with a green flag

 Also, he also told whether the next season of 'quantico' will come or not

 1
 film main aap nayika nahin balki khalanayika hai?priyanka chopra:mere kirdaar kaa naam victoria he or mujhe ye kirdaar bahut pasand aayaa
 i was very happy with the idea that a girl in the film can make a life of 6 people
 wo kharaab isliye nahin he kyonki wo dusron kaa bura chaahati he balki ye uskaa kaam he or jo bhi uske kaam ke bich aata he wo maaraa jaataa he
 All this is a business for Victoria and i found it very cool
 positive kairactor bhi achche hote hai lekin negative kairactor main shed zyada hote hai or negative chijen aap asal jindagi main kabhi nahin kar sakate
 Priyanka's revealing-wears ex-boyfriend jacket, did not return even on demand 2
 'bewaach' main aapkaa luk kaisaa he?priyanka chopra:mujhe khushi he ki is film main maine swaming costum nahin pahana he or naa hi slomoshan main bich par bhaagti najar aauungi varanaa mujhe gym main pasinaa bahaanaa padataa
 By the way, i have worn a lot of western outfits and have also gone into slomotion wearing heels
 3
 How do you see my journey to Hollywood? Priyanka Chopra: i was very clear about one thing that i will not do any small role
 meri jo image bollywood main he uskaa mujhe puraa khyaal tha
 Finally i am representing India
 india main tallent kii naa to kami he or naa hi ham log kisi se kam hai
 The rest of the journey so far has been very good and hopefully it will be right even further
 4
 Will you do another season of 'quantico' or will you do a Hindi film? Priyanka Chopra: i don't know if Quantico will have a third season or not
 par main chaahuungi ki ho
 Although the shooting of 'quantico' is time consuming
 vaise 15 din main pataa chal jayega or shaayad mujh se pehle aapako maaloom ho jaae
 As far as Hindi films are concerned, i have shortlisted three films
 iske alaava is saal 6 filmein produs bhi kar rahi hum

 america main aap hindi bolnaa miss karti hai?priyanka chopra:main apane logon se hindi main hi baat karti hum
 i can live anywhere but you cannot remove UP and Bihar from inside me
 6
 Why did you start production with regional films? Priyanka Chopra: First of all i wanted to set the platform, because of the regional film i hurried and secondly, the story does not matter in any language
 acchhee kahani kaa matlab ye nahin he ki wo sirf hindi main hi banaai jaae
 Today is the era of global cinema, every good story will be protected at the international level as well
 haal main hamaari marathi film 'ventilator' ko teen neshnal aword mili
 The motive is to give new storytellers, filmmakers a chance
 darshak sirf kahani dekhte hai wo phir kisi bhi tarah kii ho
 'baahubali' is dubbed in Hindi but has the film got an amazing opening
 7
 Did you see 'bahubali'? Priyanka Chopra: i would definitely like to see
 lekin abhi 'bewaach' ke pramotion kii vajah se main bahut masaroof hum
 But my entire staff watched the film and enjoyed it
 priyanka ko dekh kaabo kho baithe unke ko-star, kiya kis8
 As a producer, will you work only with the new talent? Priyanka Chopra: i will not only work with the new talent
 har tarah kaa tallent mere dimag main hai
 i am a very smart producer
 meri maa meri partner bhi hai
 He is the business head and i am the creative head and we also have a lot of fights over creativity and in such a situation, the most confusion happens to the people sitting in my office because of whom he spoke
 aakhir maa beti and main mil jaati he
 The aim of our production house is to get the right talent
 marathi, punjabi or bengali film bhi ham bana rahe hai
 At the moment i am having a lot of fun and hope that our film company achieves more success
 9
 Will you make a Hindi film too? Priyanka Chopra: Yes
 uski bhi baat chal rahi he lekin abhi kuch bhi kahana thodaa jaldi hoga
 i will definitely tell you when the time comes

 The round of meetings is also going on
 50-50 formule par bijepi naram najar aa rahi he, lekin mukhyamantri pad ko lekar shivasena or bijepi aamane saamne hai
 On Tuesday, a meeting of senior leaders of Maharashtra BJP took place at the home of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis in Mumbai
 is baithak ke baad netaaon ne ek sur main kaha ki devendra fadanvis kii aguwai main bijepi maharashtra main sarkaar banane ja rahi he
 At the same time, Shiv Sena is adamant that under the 50-50 formula in the state, the two parties should have a chief minister for two and a half years
 mana ja rahaa he ki bijepi is baat par to sahamat he ki mantralay main shivasena kii hissedari pachaas fisadi ho, magar puure paanch saal tak mukhyamantri or grahamantri bijepi kaa hi hoga
 Union minister and NDA ally Ramdas Athawale has said that important ministries like PWD, Housing and Revenue Department can be distributed under 50-50 formula, but BJP is not ready to give CM post and Home Ministry
 athawale ne kaha ki shivasena ko yah prastaav kabool karnaa chahie or apana rukh badalanaa chahie
 However, the BJP has refused to give any written assurance
 vahiin, duusari tarfshivsena apana stand badalaneke mood main nahin he or vah satta kii bhagidaari par bijepi se likhit aashwaasan chaahati he
 After the BJP meeting, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut clearly said that his party is determined that the BJP can assure in writing on the power participation and the CM should be changed in two and a half years
 yani bijepi ne bhale hi shivasena se prastaav mangakar uske paale main gend daalane kaa prayaas kiya ho lekin shivasena ke tevar ab bhi sakht najar aa rahe hai
 Hence, everyone is now looking towards Nagpur, where both BJP and Shiv Sena have made their presence

 ) Cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu made fun of Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar's remarks on Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid in his autobiography 'controversially Yours'
 sachin ke khilaaf kya bole shoeb akhtarsiddhu ko lagata he ki kitaab main tendulkar or dravid par kii gayi tippanee akhtar dwaara sasti lokapriyata hasil karne kaa prayaas he
 Comparing Sachin to the temple, he said, 'many birds keep flying over the temple and mosque and make them dirty but the temple and mosque are always sacred and their dirt is washed away by the rain
 ‚Äôsachin tendulkar par vishesh kaverejasiddhu ne kaha, ‚Äòtendulkar apane aap main ek santhaan hai
 Players who make such a record are not afraid of anyone
 sachin ne kai baar rawalpindi express ko patari se utaara he
 ' rajasthan saal 2003 se hi congress or bhaajapa ke bich sidhe muqablon kaa gavaah rahaa he, jisamen ashok gahalot or vasundhara raaje baari-baari se mukhyamantri banate rahe hai
 The story of elections in December also does not look any different than this, though it may take a small turn
 pradesh bhaajapa bhitari kalah se jujh rahi he or khud raaje party adhyaksh amit shah or pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saath uljhi hai
 An important difference on the Congress front this time comes from the presence of Sachin Pilot as the President of the State Congress Committee, who is challenging both Raje and Gehlot together
 payalat ko aise netaa ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he jisane gahalot ke teen dashakon ke varchasv ke dauraan alag-thalag pad chuki party or congress main nai jaan phoonk di he
 In this way, he has also created hopes for the party's imminent return, especially after the defeat of the last two elections, when in the last assembly election, the party could win just 21 seats in the 200-member assembly and in the general election, out of 25 Could not win a single Lok Sabha seat
 raaje ke khilaaf gahalot ke nijee hamalon ke ulat payalat kii ranneeti yah he ki ve ahm kshetron main raaje sarkaar kii naakaamiyon ko ubharkar saamne rakh rahe hai or yah ranneeti matadaataaon par asar karti bhi dikhaai de rahi he
 Gehlot and his loyalists are apparently nervous
 party main dhadebaaji ko bhaanpakar congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne payalat se kaha he ki ve gahalot ko saath lekar chalem, kam se kam itnaa to pakkaa karen ki saarvajanik taur par aisa hi dikhaai de
 As the Congress is emerging as a united party, the subject of discussion in the state is who will be the next Chief Minister - Gehlot or Pilot
 iskaa yah matlab to he hi ki party chunaav jeet sakati he
 As far as the BJP is concerned, Raje and Shah are running separate election campaigns
 rajya bhaajapa adhyaksh madan laal saini haalanki ise ranneeti kaa hissaa or sansadhano ke zyada se zyada istemaal kii koshish bataate hai, magar payalat kaa kahana he ki party kii antarkalah ne unhen aisa karne ko majaboor kiya he
 Confrontation with top leaders was visible throughout Raje's tenure
 rajya ikai main dharna yah ban gai he ki haai kaman ne raaje ko "switch of mod'' main daal diya, baavjood iske ki ve jabardast daure kar rahi hai or puure pradesh kaa daura kar rahi hai
 He did this for the third time in his 40-day Sooraj Gaurav Yatra
 duusari taraf, shah block str par baithken kar rahe hai or party kaaryakartaaon se feedback le rahe hai
 There is an anti-royalty lobby within the party and it is indulging in furore by beating the drunkenness of its ineffectual rule, the first indication of this was when the party vacated three out of four seats in September 2018 due to the resignation of mlas elected to the Lok Sabha
 The by-election was defeated
 bhaajapa ke ek bade mantri kehete hai, "kuchhek hafton ke dauraan hi log bagaiyr kisi vajah ke sattarudh party ke khilaaf nahin hue ho sakate the
 He also says that he has to fight Pilot, who is a non-controversial new face, along with his opponents within the party
 2003 se hi unhen dekh rahe ek afasar kaa kahana he, "raaje kaaryakartaaon ke saath ghulne-milane or baatcheet karne main kabhi utani acchhee nahin raheen jitani ve aam taur par hoti hai, par din main 16 ghante kaam karte hue bhi unhone khud ko zyaadaatar nitiyon or kaaryakramon par amal se judi baithkon tak hi simit rakhaa
 In each election rally, Raje counts his achievements and presents some of the beneficiaries of the schemes on stage
 saath hi sarkaar bhi reliyaan yojit kar rahi hai, jinamein 7 july ko jaipur kii vah raily bhi thi, jise modi ne sambodhit kiya tha or jisamen 40,000 shikshakon kii bhartee karne or 6,000 kanstablon ko padonnati dene sareekhee kamyaabiyon ko ginaya gaya tha
 The party and the government have planned many more such rallies for farmers, scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, especially after their debts of Rs 50,000 have been waived
 mukhya rup se gramin niwarchan kshetron par dhyaan dene vaali raaje kii gaurav yatra ke samaapan ke liye modi bhi jaldi hi rajya kii yatra par aaenge or shahari ilaakon main bhi party kaa chunaav abhiyaan shuru karenge
 The state government is having to grapple with many other issues which have only increased Raje's troubles
 inamen essi / asti atyaachaar kanoon main sanshodhan ko lekar savarna jatiyon or daliton ke bich takaraav se judaa mudda he, to bazaar main mandi ke halaat kaa mudda bhi, jiske liye vyapaaree modi kii aarthik nitiyon ko jimmedaar tehra rahe hai
 The Congress is raising all these issues in its election campaign
 udhar, bhaajapa congress ke 50 saal ke kuraj kaa raag alaap rahi he, jise kam hi log sanjidagi se le rahe hai, kyonki ek to payalat nayaa cheharaa hai or duusare, beete 28 saal main se 18 saal bhaajapa rajasthan main satta main rahi he
 The disenchantment of voters from both the Congress and the BJP is evident from the fact that in 2008, independents and other candidates got 15 per cent votes and in 2013 the vote on "NOTA" was more than the win-loss margin of 11 seats
 Were
 iskaa yah bhi matlab he ki congress yah maanakar nahin chal sakati ki satta virdohi voton kaa uski jholii main aana tay he
 This is the reason why both parties are looking more closely at caste equations
 congress ne raaje par shahari aadharbhoot dhaanche, kisaanon or berozegaar yuvaaon ko nazarandaaj karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The party is also trying to reach out to a section of Rajputs, including Jaswant Singh's son Manvendra Singh, who recently quit the BJP
 duusari taraf, bhaajapa haai kaman rajput voton ko phisalane nahin dene ke liye ji-jaan se juta he
 At the same time, Raje has appointed several Jat officers to important posts to gain the support of Jats
 saaf he, rajasthan ranneetiyon kii jang kaa maidan ban gaya he

 BJP is a bit nervous due to the TV poll polls and Aam Aadmi Party workers are looking excited by it
 gol market main ek aam aadmi party kaaryakarta ne chaay ke thele par baatcheet ke dauraan kaha, "hamaara voter ghar main baithe rahane vaala nahin he
 
 
 They are all poor people, who want to get rid of inflation and corruption

 BJP leaders have recently raised slogans like 'stable government' and 'chalein Modi saath' and asked voters to be 'wary of false promises'
 pradhanmantri modi reliyon ke saath bijepi ke vigyapanon main yah kehete dikhe hai ki jinhen footpath par dharna karne main maharath he, unhen vahi kaam dijie, hamen acchhee sarkaar chalaane main maharath he, hamen vah kaam dijie
 In fact, this jumla is with the BJP, which it is using to woo voters and it is also having an impact on Narendra Modi's fans and supporters on the streets of Delhi
 conot place main 36 saal ke hansraj kehete hai, "kejariwal jitna bhi jor laga len, lekin pichhali baar vah sarkaar chhodkar bhaag gaye the
 
 
 Modi ji is a performer
 
 
 vot unheen ko diya jayega
 
 
 " yani ek ore narendra modi kii chhavi he, jo ab bhi middle clos main apil karti he or duusari ore kejariwal ke paas bhrashtachar-virdohi naaraa or garib aam aadmi kaa saath he, lekin is ladaai main congress kahaan khadi he
 These elections are really bad for the Congress
 
 
 aakhri vakt main rahul gandhi logon ke saamne aae zarur hai, lekin unka vot tuutakar kejariwal kii ore chalaa gaya he
 On Wednesday, Rahul Gandhi raised the issue of Jayanthi Natarajan, in favor of tribals and weaker sections
 kaha ki unhone hi (rahul ne hi) jayanti se kaha tha ki vah project paas karte vakt garibon or adivaasiyon kaa khyal rakhen
 Rahul also did a road show on the last day of the election campaign, in which a good crowd gathered, but his half-hearted enthusiasm could not gather the voters in every election
 loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan banaras main modi or kejariwal kii takkar main bhi rahul aakhri din prachaar karne aae, jisamen bheed to ai thi, lekin vot unke ummidavaar ko nahin mil paae the
 The general opinion of the people of Delhi is that this appeal of Rahul Gandhi will also not have immediate effect
 "congress kaa jhanda or danda hill gaya he
 
 
 No one to vote immediately
 
 
 " kabhi congress ke samarthak rahe biren kehete hai, jo is baar aam aadmi ko vot daalane vaale hai
 He then says, 'loss of Congress means, Aam Aadmi Party's advantage, and loss of broom, means vote will go to Kamal
 
 
 " This is the truth of Delhi election today
 
 
 congress kaa vot khiskkar jhaadu ke paas ja rahaa he
 The challenge before the BJP is to get its voters out to cut this edge
 shanivaar ko voter turnout ahm sanket degaa, taiyaar rahiega

 Even though the picture of power in Uttar Pradesh may change, the people in power do not let the fate of the state change
 vaise tasviir badale bhi to kaise? khaali baton se bhala kabhi kuch badla he? jinhen kaayade se kaam karnaa chahie, wo sirf baaten kar rahe hai
 This is the face of humanity in Uttar Pradesh, after the girl cut her tongue
 rape ke baad ladki ko zindaa jala diya
 Cheerfulness with a four year old girl
 saal bhar kii bacchee bhi mahafooz nahin
 After the rape of an innocent, the tongue is cut off, then it is being burnt alive by honoring someone
 taaki jo sachmuch bol sakati hai wo chup rahen
 Remain silent so that no one can hear
 chaar saal kii bacchee ke saath kahin balaatkaar ho rahaa he to ek saal tak kii maasoom bhi mahfuj nahin he akhilesh ji ke uttar pradesh main
 Nearly four months ago, Akhilesh Sarkar has completed one year in the throne of Lucknow
 15 march 2012 ko akhilesh ne pradesh kii bagdor sanbhali thi
 The first promise was to change the picture of crime in the state
 tasviir sach main badali, par acchhee hone kii bajaae or buree ho gai
 In the first year of his state, there were more than three thousand murder, close to thousand rapes, more than thousand kidnapping and more than four thousand robbery cases
 akhilesh sahab aakhir aapke upi main raaj kiskaa he? janata behaal he
 Police helplessness and persecution of the oppressed is increasing
 kam se kam aapkaa raaj to nahin lagata he
 From Lucknow to Etawah, Pratapgarh to Bulandshahr, people are suffering
 vaardaat itani khaufnak ki ruh kaanp jaae or aap hai ki bas baaten kiye ja rahe hai
 Look at the matter itself, the first girl was trapped in a love trap for 2 years
 phir use dhokhe se premi ne kamare main bulaayaa, vahaan premi or uske 3-4 doston ne ladki kii izzat taar taar kii or uske baad is ladki ko jinda jala diya
 Now the girl has reached the verge of dying in the hospital
 sunakar kisi kii bhi ruh kaanp uthegi, lekin hairaani ab or bad jaaegi, jab aapako ye pataa chalegaa ki ladki ko aag ke hawaale kiya gaya mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke jile itawa main
 The afflicted girl lying on the bed of Saifai's medical college has burnt more than 90 percent
 jindagi dobaaraa milane kii sambhaavna na ke baraabar he
 Although a case has been registered against 7 people of Desramau village in Iqdil area of etawah district, all the accused are absconding and no arrests have been made
 rajya ke aalaa police adhikari maamle kii lipapoti main lage hai, jabaki jile kaa police mahakama sirf cese darj kar maamle se pallaa jhaadne kii jugat kar rahaa he
 It is surprising that criminals and rapists have become fearless under the rule of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, who claims to make Uttar Pradesh a perfect state, while the police are lethargic and helpless
 pidaa hoti he us bayaan ko sunakar bhi jab satta par kabiz samaajawaadee party ke kaddavar netaa ye kehete hai ki aisi ghatnaayen to desh ke duusare rajyon main bhi hoti hai
 The ruling party is trying to defend the case, but the opposing parties have a chance to surround the government again
 akhilesh ke raaj main mahilaon ke khilaaf badhate aparaadh ko aankadon ke hisaab se bhi samajhie
 In 2011, 22639 crime cases were registered against women all over Uttar Pradesh, while in 2012, this figure increased to 23569 i
e
 an increase of 930
 2012 main uttar pradesh main balaatkaar ke 1963 maamle darj kiye gaye
 The state where women are becoming increasingly vulnerable
 kya wo kabhi uttam pradesh ban paaegaa? jis rajya main har roj ausatan 5 se zyada balaatkaar hote hai, kya wo rajya kabhi viksit ho paaegaa?duusari kahani, pehle ladki kii izzat ko taar-taar kiya, phir parivaar jo jaan se maarane kii dhamkee di or aakhir main peedit ladki ko kii hi jaan se maarane kii koshish
 The story is not of any TV serial, this is the reality of Akhilesh Yadav's Uttar Pradesh, where the domination of the bullying is overshadowing the life of a minor
 uttar pradesh ke pratapgarh jile ke jethvara thane ke naubasta gaanv kii naaballig yuvati baar-baar gaanv ke dabangon kii darindagi kaa shikaar ho rahi he
 At present, the district is hospitalized, while all the absconders, except the 1 accused who attacked him, are roaming around
 darasal yuvati or uske parivaar kaa aarope he ki isi saal 22 janvari ko gaanv ke ek yuvak ne use apni havas kaa shikaar banaaya
 Police registered a rape case and sent the accused to jail
 isi maamle main peedit naaballig ko 24 july ko court main magistrate ke saamne bayaan darj karnaa tha
 But before that, according to the family of the girl, late Wednesday evening, when the victim girl was going out of the house, at the same time, the brother, relatives and another person of the already accused rape accused caught the girl and gave her Taken to a deserted place
 vahaan kisi dhardaar hathiyaar se unhone uski jeebh kaatane kii khatarnaak koshish kii or use lahooluhaan haalat main vahiin chhod bhaag khadey hue
 a scarred man can also see deep wounds on the tongue of a girl lying on a hospital bed, but the Uttar Pradesh Police may be missing its eyesight and destiny only when it sees a common injury
 har baar kii tarah police kaa is maamle main bhi pardaa daalane kii koshish, ye sabit kar rahaa he ki rajya main uske insaaf karne kaa paimaana shaayad aaropee or peedit ke saamaajik, raajnneetik or aarthik haisiyat ko taul kar hi kiya jaataa he
 During the tenure of the Samajwadi Party government of Akhilesh Yadav, more than one hundred and fifty cases of rape have been reported in Pratapgarh alone, but the chain did not stop
 na jane uttar pradesh ko uttam pradesh kab banaaenge akhilesh yadav
 Look at this face of cruelty
 45 saal ke shaks ne 13 maheene kii maasoom bacchee se balaatkaar kiya
 It is not sure to hear it, but it is the truth which will make anyone's tremor on hearing it
 ek maasoom jisaki umr abhi gudde-guddiyon se khilne kii thi us maasoom ke saath ek vahashi ne sirf apni havas mitaane ke liye balaatkaar kar diya
 Actually, the accused came to the marriage of one of his relatives in Hirapur village
 ye bacchee bhi apane parivaar ke saath isi shaadi main ai hui thi
 During the night, the accused put the child to sleep and then raped her
 balaatkaar ke baad bacchee kii haalat jab zyaada bighad gai tab usko jila mahila aspataal bhej gaya
 Where after he got his primary treatment, he was shifted to the government hospital in Meerut
 philhal police aaropee ko hiraasat main lene ke baad apni karrwai main juty he
 But there the condition of that innocent remains very serious
 upi main har roj ho rahi balaatkaar kii vaardaat ko dekhakar to ye sawal uthanaa lajimi he ki kya akhilesh raaj main mahilaayein or bacchiyaan mahfuj hai? There is news of an encounter with Naxalites in Dantewada, Chhattisgarh

 ritairement ke baad viraat kaa kya hoga- is bare main abhi tak koi faisla nahin liya gaya he
 The Navy says that talks are going on with the Andhra Pradesh government because no one else has shown interest in taking it
 is bare main koi kuch bolne ko taiyaar nahin he, lekin jaankaree mili he ki agar andhra sarkaar ise museum main badalati he to is par kareeb 1000 karod kharch aayega, lekin vah chaah rahi he ki iskaa aadha kharch raksha mantralay uthaae jabaki raksha mantralay ke sutron kaa kahana he ki ve takneekee madad or salaah dene ko taiyaar hai
 Now the final decision has to be taken by the Andhra government
 vaise sabase zyada samay tak seva main rahane kii vajah se iskaa naam ginis book of records main pehle hi darj ho chukaa he
 The comments bilkul apane naam ke mutabik-viraat kareeb 24 hajaar ton vajani he
 It is 743 feet long
 chaudaai 160 foot he
 Its speed is about 52 kilometers per hour
 nausena main ise 12 may 1987 ko shaamil kiya gaya
 Sea harrier fighter aircraft were stationed in this vessel
 saath main is par siking helicopter bhi maujuud the
 There were about 1500 naval vessels in this vessel and once it came out of the sea, it used to go with three months ration
 kareeb do sau kilometre ke ilaake main isaki tuuti bolti thi, haalanki nausena ne na to kargil jang or naa hi srilanka main oparation vijay main sidhe taur par hissaa liya tha lekin iske baavjood viraat ne is dauraan ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Virat, the world's oldest aircraft carrier, participated in the International Fleet Review in Visakhapatnam in February last year
 yah uskaa antim oparational tainaati thi
 It was the center of attraction for everyone there
 iske alaava vimaan vaahak pot ne america nausena ke saath malabar abhyaas, francisi nausena ke saath varun, oman nausena ke saath naseem al bahaar jaise kai atanrarashtriya nausainik abhyaason main hissaa liya
 The aircraft carrier has spent 27 years in the Royal Navy of Bitrain and 29 years in the Indian Navy
 viraat ke deck se kai ladaaku vimaanon ne 22,034 kii udaan bhari he
 It has traveled about 2,250 days and about 10,94,215 km at sea
 iskaa matlab yah he ki viraat ne samudr main chah saal se zyada samay guzaara jisamen duniya kaa kareeb 27 dfa chakkar lagaaya ja saktaa he
 This simply means that Virat spent six years in his thirty years of service in the sea and the rest at the port
 vaise raksha mantralay ne kaaphi pehle hi desh ke nau samudri rajyon ko chitthee likhakar kaha tha ki aap chahen to viraat ko maatr ek rupee kii token mani dekar le sakate hai
 Either you make it a museum or something so that its honor is maintained, but nobody except Andhra Pradesh showed interest in taking it
 viraat main kaam kar chuke kaiyon ko ab aisa laga rahaa he ki kahin iskaa bhi haal vikrant vimanavahak pot jaisaa naa ho
 In Mumbai, the Navy waited 14 years at the Mumbai port for INS Vikrant but no one came to pick it up and then it was sold to junk
 ab haalat ye he ki abhi tak naa koi rajya sarkaar or naa hi privet sector viraat ko lene ko taiyaar he
 Exactly according to his name - Virat weighs around 24 thousand tons
 yah 743 foot lanbaa he
 The width is 160 feet
 isaki raftaar kareeb 52 kilometre pratighanta he
 It was inducted into the Navy on 12 May 1987
 is pot main si herier ladaaku vimaan tainaat the
 Along with this, seaking helicopters were also present
 is pot main kareeb 1500 nausenic rahete the or ek baar jab samandar se nikalataa tha to saath main teen maheene kaa rashan lekar nikalataa tha
 It covered the area of about two hundred kilometers, although the Navy neither directly participated in Kargil Jung nor Operation Vijay in Sri Lanka, but despite this, Virat played an important role during this time
 duniya ke sabase puraane vimaan vaahak pot viraat ne vishakhapatnam main pichley saal farvari main hue antarrashtriya flit rivyuu main hissaa liya tha
 This was his last operational deployment
 vahaan par yah sabake aakarshan kaa kendra tha
 In addition, the aircraft carrier participated in several international naval exercises such as Malabar exercises with the US Navy, Varun with the French Navy, Nasim Al Bahar with the Oman Navy
 is vimanavahak pot ne bitrain kii royal navy main 27 or bhartiya nausena main 29 saal bitaye hai
 Several combat aircraft have flown 22,034 from Virat's deck
 isane kareeb 2,250 din or kareeb 10,94,215 kilometre kaa safar samudr main tay kiya he
 This means that Virat spent more than six years in the sea, which can be circulated around 27 times in the world
 iskaa sidhaa matlab ye he ki viraat ne apane tees saal kii seva main chah saal samandar main rahaa or baaki bandargah par
 By the way, the Ministry of Defense had written a letter to the nine maritime states of the country long ago and said that if you want, you can take only one rupee token money to Virat
 yaa to aap ise museum banaaen yaa phir kuch aisa ki iskaa sammaan kaayam rahe, lekin andhrapradesh ko chhodkar kisi ne ise lene main ruchi nahin dikhaai
 Many who have worked in Virat are now feeling that it should not be like Vikrant aircraft carrier
 mumbai main nausena ne ienes vikrant ke liye 14 saal mumbai bandargah par intjaar kiya lekin koi ise lene nahi aayaa tab jaakar ise kabad main bech diya gaya
 Now the situation is that so far no state government nor private sector is ready to take on Virat
