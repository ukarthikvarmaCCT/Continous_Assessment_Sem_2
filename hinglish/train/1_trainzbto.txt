 He was very insolent and foolish
 apane ritair hone ke bahut pehle se hi ganguli apni gardan se cricket khilne lage the- unki gardan, uthati gend ke khilaaf unke bat se zyada tej thi
 On more than one occasion Ganguly had a mysterious back ache after seeing a green pitch on the first day of the match
 duniya ke tej gendbaajon ko jab bhi majaak kii kami hoti to unhen sirf yah karnaa padataa ki ve gend ke raste se hatane kii koshish karte hue ganguli kaa ek video dekhte or jashn shuru ho jaataa
 21 December 2011: Look at the pictures India Todayganguli had style, but he lacked courage
 yah baat to thik he ki koi purna nahin hota
 Virender Sehwag has a bucketful of courage and a lot of talent, but you have to measure his decision-making with a spoon

 Accept or leave, and we gladly accept him because Sehwag's presence sits much heavier than his farewell sob

 jabaki police daawa kar rahi he ki use guard ne danda se maaraa tha, jisase uske sir main chot ai thi or kaaphi khun bah gaya tha
 In the Anmol assassination case, Tehelka's editor-at-large Ajit Sahi is eye-witness, who lives in the same apartment in Kalkaji where Anmol died
 unhone hi raat kareeb 11 bajkar 15 minute par hangaame kii aawaaj sunakar guard ko bulaayaa tha
 In a conversation with Headlines Today, Sahi said, 'I heard the sound of someone shouting loudly at night, i felt that there was a fight going on in someone's house
 haalanki kuch samay baad aawaaj halki ho gai, lekin baraabar kisi ke 'chikki' or 'madhav' bolne kii aawaaj aa rahi thi
 When the sound of constant abusive speech came, i called the guard of the main gate
 us guard ne kaha ki vah get par akelaa he isliye kisi or get se guard ko bulaayaa jaae
 After that i called Narendra Mishra and Surendra Bhati, who have recently been posted guards in the society
 main khud bhi us ore gaya, jahaan se aawaaj aa rahi thi
 i felt the sound coming from the stairs and i climbed the first floor
 vahaan maine ek ladke ko dekha jo ki paseene se tarbatar tha, lekin uske sir par chot ke nishaan nahin the or na hi uske sir se khun bah rahaa tha
 i was in front of him and he tried to attack me when i saw him and i hurried away to escape
 'saahi ne bataaya, 'uske baad vah sidhiyon se chillaate hue neeche utar gaya
 When the guard Mishra tried to catch him, he tried to kill the guard
 guard ne use rokane ke liye use peeche se pakadaa
 But during this time there was no injury to the boy's head
 'guard mishra ne kaha, 'main puraa maamla jaanane ke liye upar flats number 95 main gaya, jahaan party chal rahi thi
 There Pranel Shah's father opened the door and told that the boy is his son's friend
 pranel ke pita ne yah bhi kaha ki unhen nahin pataa ki kya hua
 He said that the boys had turned off the room lights
 'is dauraan anmol daud rahaa tha or lagaataar chilla rahaa tha
 After that other people also came out hearing the noise and called the PCR van
 pisiar kii gaadi sosayadi main kareeb 12 bajkar 20 minute main pahunchi
 Sahi said, 'I saw Anmol walking in the PCR van himself
 tab tak use sir par koi chot nahin lagi thi or sir se naa hi khun bah rahaa tha
 Now it is not known what happened to him in the PCR van
 'gauratlab he ki 13 sitambar ko police ke mutabik is party main paanchon doston ne drugs lee thi
 He was supplied drugs by a smuggler from Noida
 anmol kii maut ke pehle kya kuch hua iskaa khulaasa sisitivi footage se hua he
 What is the police's police say that after taking drugs Anmol started a ruckus and started running out of the house here in the society
 is dauraan ek guard ne uske sir par lohe kii rod se waar kar diya
 According to local people, those people could not muster the courage to go to him due to this uproar
 ant main police ko soochna di gai, lekin tab tak kaaphi khun bah chukaa tha, jisase anmol kii maut ho gai
 Six people arrested in the case of murder
 In this case, six people have been arrested by the police
 inamen chaar anmol ke dost hai or do guard shaamil hai
 Police have registered a case of murder against Surendra Bali and Naresh, both security guards, while Anmol's friends have been booked under the Narcotics Act for taking intoxicants
 disipi southeast ke pi karunakaran ke mutabik, sisitivi footage, chashmadidon ke bayaan or danda guard ke khilaaf saboot hai
 Along with this, doctors who have done postmortem of Anmol have also been consulted
 postmortem kii report se bhi anmol ke sharir main chot ke nishaanon kii pushti hui he
 All four of his friends, Shivank, Madhav, Ridham and Pranel have also confessed to taking drugs
 iske saath hi in chaaron ke khun or peshaab ke jaanch se bhi saaf ho gaya he ki us raat in sabhi ne drugs lee thi, lekin apartment main drugs baraamad nahin hua tha
 a case of murder has been registered against the guard under section 302 of the IPC, but this section can also be changed during the investigation as the guard had no intention of killing
 anmol kii maut ke baad kai sawaal hai, jaise-- anmol flats se bina shart ke hi baahar kyon aayaa?- aakhir anmol ko chot kaise lagi?- kya anmol kisi haadase kaa shikaar hua?- yaa phir use kisi ne jaanboojhkar maaraa?- kya party main drugs kaa istemaal hua?- aakhir ladakon ko drugs kisne muhaiyaa karavaayi?- aakhir anmol ke doston ne pisiar kol main deree kyon kii?

 sawaal- kya jandhan main gadabadi par bhi aapaki najar he?jandhan main 8 november ke baad kaaphi paisa jamaa hua
 Investigation agencies noticed that a lot of money has been accumulated unaided
 agar ham jandhan par 1 xxrep 4 0 kii ceiling nahin lagaate to vah paisa idhar-udhar nikaala ja saktaa tha
 This step was taken to rein in the wrong people
 sawaal- sone ko lekar logon ke man main dar he ki kahin gold par bhi sarkaar limit tay naa kar de?sone par monetigeshan band bhi sarkaar lekar ai
 Those who bought or sold more gold after 8 November are eyeing the agencies
 unke acount ham dekhenge, lekin jo log eemaandaaree se sona kharidte hai chaahe vah limit se zyada bhi ho, unhen darane kii jarurat nahin
 But the money that was kept in sacks and used to buy gold, we are watching them
 eemaandaaron ko darane kii zarurat nahin
 Question- What will be the impact on GDP in the coming days? On Prime Minister Manmohan Singh who said that after demonetisation, GDP will be reduced by two percent, we want to tell that there are unaccounted GDP in our country, such as worker Or 15,000 workers to be signed to 20,000, GDP will increase manifold when all these accounts are there

 salmaan khan ke saath is dukh kii ghadi main bollywood se dheron log unke dukh baantne aae magar katrina caff is bheed main ab tak kahin bhi nazar nahin ain
 On May 6, the day Bollywood stars started visiting Salman's house at the Galaxy apartment on the day Salman Khan was convicted in the hit and run case and sentenced to 5 years in prison
 shahrukh khan jinase saalon tak baatcheet band rahi vah bhi salmaan se milane aae
 Once upon a time, Sangeeta Bijlani, who was a special friend of Salman Khan, also came after the declaration of punishment, but Katrina Kaif did not come
 vah katrina jo salmaan ke liye dost se badhkar thim
 Salman made Katrina a big figure in Bollywood and cast Katrina in many of her films early in Katrina's career, due to which Katrina joined the race of big actresses
 tippaniyan But the thing to see is why Katrina did not come? Katrina was like a member of the Khan family
 kahin aisa to nahin ki salmaan se alag hokar ranbir kapur se rishta banane kii vajah se katrina nahin ai hon? ho bhi saktaa he kyonki ranbir kapur se pehle salmaan or katrina kii shaadi tak ke charche shuru ho chuke the
 And now Katrina and Ranbir's marriage is being discussed
 ek baat yah bhi dekhne vaali he ki ranbir kapur bhi salmaan se milane nahin aae jabaki ranbir kii pehali film 'saanwariyaa' main salmaan ne mehmaan bhoomika nibhaai thi or salmaan ne ranbir kii badi sahaayta kii thi phir bhi ranbir ab tak salmaan ke ghar aane vaale sitaron main shaamil nahin hue haalanki ranbir ke pita rishi kapur ne twit kar apana dukh vyakt kiya tha or kaha tha ki khan ke saath is dukh kii ghadi main capur parivaar unke saath he
 Yes, in response to Ranbir's questioning in front of the media, he definitely said that he is sorry and God bless Salman and his family
 6 may, jis din salmaan khan ko hit and ran maamle main doshi qaraar diya gaya or 5 saal kii sazaa sunai gai, usase ek din pehle se hi salmaan ke ghar galaxi apartment main bollywood sitaron kaa aana-janaa shuru ho gaya tha
 Shah Rukh Khan, who had been in talks for years, also came to meet Salman
 kisi jamaane main salmaan khan kii khaas dost rahi sangeeta bijlani bhi sazaa ke elaan ke baad ain magar nahin ain to katrina caff
 She was more than a friend to Katrina who was Salman
 salmaan ne katrina ko bollywood main bada mukaam dilaayaa or katrina ke kariyar ke shuruaati daur main apni kai filmon main katrina ko cast karavaaya, jisaki vajah se katrina badi abhinetriyon kii daud main shaamil huin
 The comments magar dekhne vaali baat yah he ki aakhir katrina kyon nahin ain? katrina jo khan parivaar kii ek sadsy kii tarah thim
 Is it not that Katrina did not come due to parting with Salman and Ranbir Kapoor? It may also be because before Salman and Katrina's marriage before Ranbir Kapoor, discussions had begun
 or ab katrina or ranbir kii shaadi ke charche ho rahe hai
 One thing to see is that even Ranbir Kapoor did not come to meet Salman while Salman played a guest role in Ranbir's first film 'saawariya' and Salman had helped Ranbir a lot, yet Ranbir still comes to Salman's house However, Ranbir's father Rishi Kapoor expressed his grief by tweeting that the Kapur family is with him in this hour of grief with Khan
 haa, ranbir ne media ke saamne sawaal poochne par apni pratikriya main ye zarur kaha ki unhen dukh he or salmaan or unke parivaar ko bhagwaan himmat or haunsala de
 But the thing to see is why Katrina did not come? Katrina was like a member of the Khan family
 kahin aisa to nahin ki salmaan se alag hokar ranbir kapur se rishta banane kii vajah se katrina nahin ai hon? ho bhi saktaa he kyonki ranbir kapur se pehle salmaan or katrina kii shaadi tak ke charche shuru ho chuke the
 And now Katrina and Ranbir's marriage is being discussed
 ek baat yah bhi dekhne vaali he ki ranbir kapur bhi salmaan se milane nahin aae jabaki ranbir kii pehali film 'saanwariyaa' main salmaan ne mehmaan bhoomika nibhaai thi or salmaan ne ranbir kii badi sahaayta kii thi phir bhi ranbir ab tak salmaan ke ghar aane vaale sitaron main shaamil nahin hue haalanki ranbir ke pita rishi kapur ne twit kar apana dukh vyakt kiya tha or kaha tha ki khan ke saath is dukh kii ghadi main capur parivaar unke saath he
 Yes, in response to Ranbir's questioning in front of the media, he definitely said that he is sorry and God bless Salman and his family

 citigenship bill par soshal media ke madhyam se vivaadaaspad tippanee karne vaale chaatr netaa vivon thokchom ko dilli hoicourt ne koi raahat dene se inkaar kar diya he
 Student leader Vivon Thokchom challenged his arrest in the Delhi High Court and the subsequent transit remand from the Saket Court to the Delhi High Court
 somvaar ko sunwaayee puri karke dilli hoicourt ne chaatr netaa vivon thokchom kii us arji ko thukraa diya jisamen usne court se manipur na bhejne kii maang kii thi
 Manipur police had registered a case against him for seditious remarks under charges of treason
 dilli police ke sahyog se use 15 farvari ko dilli se hi giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 The Manipur Police had sought permission to take him to Manipur after presenting him in Delhi's Saket Court (transit remand), which was accepted by the court
 chaatr ke bhai ne dilli ke saket court ke aadesh ko dilli hoicourt main chunauti di
 The High Court dismissed her petition
 dilli hoicourt ne uski yachika khaarij karte hue apane aadesh main kaha he ki vivon thokchom kii giraftaar ke baad police kii ore se kisi bhi niyam kaa ulanghan nahin kiya gaya he or uske parivaar ko arest memo diya gaya tha
 Apart from this, the police claim that it has enough evidence to investigate this case against Thokchom
 court philhal abhi is cese kii merit par nahin ja rahi he lekin giraftaar par court ko kuch galat nahin dikhaai nahin de rahaa he
 Therefore, the court dismissed the petition of Vivon Thokchom
 yachika main kaha gaya tha ki chaatr thokchom ke khilaaf deshadroh kaa maamla hi nahin banataa he, uski giraftaar avaidh he
 Therefore, the order of sending Saket court to Manipur and the FIR of the police should be quashed
 manipur police ne sunwaayee ke dauraan hoicourt ko bataaya ki chaatr ke vakil gumraah karne vaale tathy pesh kar rahe hai
 It is necessary to take the student to Manipur and be presented in court there
 isliye dilli kii nichali adaalat ke faisle ko nirast nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Despite all the hustle and bustle, Delhi is not getting depleted

 super computer se kai guna tej he Quantum Supremacy
 Google claims - it will change the way of computing
 Google ne elaan kiya he ki company ne Quantum Supremacy hasil kar lee he
 Some time ago, Google's paper linked to it was leaked on the Internet, since then Quontom has been making supremacy in the news
 Google ke siio sundar pichaai ne twit karke utsaah jataayaa he
 Google has published a new article in the popular scientific journal Nature
 isamen company ne bade daawey kiye hai or isse computing puri tarah se badal sakati he
 It was being worked on for two decades and now finally Google has got success in it
 Quantum Supremacy se tradishnal computing ko puri tarah se badla ja saktaa he
 a New York Times report quotes the University of Texas computer scientist, who has reviewed the paper released by Google
 unhone kaha he, ‘1903 main jab Wright Brothers ne plane flite kaa avishkaar kiya tha tab wo yujaphul airplane nahin tha, lekin ise isliye dizin kiya gaya tha, taaki point ko pruv kiya ja sake or isane point ko pruv kiya’kul mila kar baat ye he ki Quantum Supremacy bhale abhi kaam main na laayaa jaae, lekin aane vaale samay main ye computing ke tareekon ko badal saktaa he
 The method of such computing is quite different from traditional computing
 tradishnal computing main 0 or 1 kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he, lekin Quantum Supremacy se ye bhi badal diya gaya he
 Google says that the 54-qubit Sycamore processor has done that calculation in just 200 seconds, which can be done by the traditional and most powerful supercomputers in the world in 10,000 years
 google ne kaha he ki ye milastone achiv karne ke liye company ne kadi mehnat kii he or lagbhag do dashak ke baad ye safalataa mili he
 Sightinst had been working on it since 1980
 IBM ko google par shaq he!saaf shabdon main kahen to google ne ye daawa kiya he ki tradishnal super computer se ye kaaphi tej he
 Now obviously it will be compared to supercomputers
 IBM super computer ke maamle main kaaphi aage he or ibiem ne google ke is daawey ko ek tarah se galat tehraane kii koshish kii he
 IBM has said that it is not what Google claimed that it would take 10,000 years for a supercomputer to do this particular type of calculation
 kyonki super computer isi task ko sirf 2
 Can perform in 5 days
 sundar pichaai ne ek twit main kaha he, ‘quantum Computing bhavishya main kya kar saktaa he, use lekar utsahit hum
 It gives us a way to speak a new language, so that the world can be understood better, not just from 1 and 0, but with all its states - beautiful, complex and limitless possibilities
 saadhaaran computer or kwantum computer alag kaise hai?saadhaaran computers main information bits main store hote hai
 The value of these bits can be either 0, then 1
 lekin quantum system isse alag kaam karata he
 Here they are equal
 yahaan bit kii jagah information quantum bit yani qubit main store hote hai or ye 0 yaa 1 ek saath ho sakate hai
 What is quantum supremacy? Just understand that quantum supermacy is a kind of capability that can solve problems that do not belong to traditional computers
 kitni bhi jatil samasya kyon na ho ise kwantum supermesi ke jariye solve kiya ja saktaa he
 Quantum computers are not viewable like desktops or laptops
 ye alag-alag parts main hote hai, jinhen sarwar room main rakhaa jaataa he
 Common computers process an information in 1 and 0, it can be called bits
 super computers kii baat karen to ye ek seconts main kai hajaar trillian oparations ko anjaam dete hai jo aam computer kii kshamta se kahin zyada he
 As far as Quantum Computer is concerned, they work on quantum bits, which you can also call quibits
 sarkari kaamkaaj main soochna ke mahatv ko kabhi nakaara nahin ja saktaa
 The Right to Information Act of 2005 clarifies' It is essential for democracy that the common citizen gets complete information and transparency in the exchange of information, it helps in curbing corruption and can also make the government accountable
 ’lekin aaj ke paripeksh main kaha ja saktaa he ki ise bhulaayaa ja rahaa he
 The case has even gone so far that during the hearing of Rafael's alleged missing documents, the Supreme Court reminded Attorney General KK Venugopal of three sections of RTI and ordered him to read these sections in open court, Section 22 - Privacy Act SECTION 24 - In the cases of corruption and human rights, it is necessary to give information to security and confidential agencies also SECTION 8 (2) - All Form on interest RTI around Pardrshitadesh more important Honshi candidates and appointment of anonymity workers are constantly demands that may be taken transparency in appointments of information commissioners in the state
 2018 main supreme court main ek janhit yachika daayar kii gai, jiske jawaab main adaalat ne farvari 2019 main sarkaar ko niyuktiyon ke liye 4 mukhya binduon par dhyaan dene ke nirdesh diye

 niyukti kii prakriya 1 se 2 maheene pehle shuru ho

 According to sections 12 (5) and 13 (5), the Information Commissioner can be any person of public life who has experience in law, science, social work, journalism or governance
 centre sarkaar ne ab tak soochna ayukta ke liye jaruri arhata ko saarvajanik nahin kiya he
 In response to an RTI, the Center has said that the advice of the Supreme Court is being considered
 2009 se 2012 tak soochna ayukta rahe shailesh gandhi kehete hai ‘ ummidavaaron kaa chunaav raajnneetik vichaardhaara yaa naukarshahi ke saath achche rishton par nirbhar karata he
 In the last few years, no appointment in the Central Information Commission was possible without court intervention
 2018 main ek janhit yachika ke baad hi mukhya soochna ayukta or 4 soochna ayuktaon kii niyukti hui thi
 Till then the court had not given any instructions, even now 4 posts are lying vacant

 All these changes have been done without public consultation, so it would be better for the new government to consider it before trying again, because it is not just information, many cases of corruption are opened on the basis of this information

 The Cricket Board of India (BCCI) ombudsman and ethical officer DK Jain has served a notice to cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar on his birthday on Wednesday
 yah notice unke alaava vivies lakshmana ko bhi bheja gaya he
 According to the information, this notice has been issued for alleged conflict of interest due to IPL franchise being a member of Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) with Mentor
 tendulkar mumbai indiens ke or lakshmana sunrisers hyderabad ke mentor hai
 This is the third case of allegations of conflict of interest
 inase pehle purv captain saurav ganguli ko cab adhyaksh, siesi sadsy or dilli capitals ke salahakaar ke taur par teen bhoomika nibhaane ke liye nyaayamurti (sevanivrutt) jain ke samaksh sunwaayee ke liye pesh hona padaa tha
 All three were part of the CAC that selected senior national coach Ravi Shastri in July 2017, their last meeting
 haalanki bisisiai sutron se pataa chalaa he ki tendulkar kaa mumbai indiens se koi vittiya qaraar nahin he or teenon siesi ke sadsy ke taur par swechhik seva kar rahe hai
 a senior BCCI official said, 'because the notice was issued to Ganguly, the Lokpal has probably issued notice to both Tendulkar and Laxman as well
 lekin main pushti kar saktaa hum ki tendulkar mumbai indiens se ek bhi paisa nahin lete
 He is just doing voluntary service
 bisisiai main bhi unhen siesi main apni sevaayen dene ke liye ek bhi paisa nahin diya gaya
 In the notice, Justice Jain has asked both Tendulkar and Laxman to give a written reply to the allegations by 28 April, as well as the BCCI
 yah shikaayat madhya pradesh cricket sangh (empisie) ke sadsy sanjeev gupta ne daayar kii he
 The Lokpal also said that after failing to respond, he would not be given any more opportunity to express his views

 According to the police, the four robbers arrested are residents of Mewat
 police ne giraftaar aropiyon ke paas se2
 5 lakh in cash, a desi katta and a motorcycle have been recovered
 police ne giraftaar chaaron luteron ko jila adaalat main pesh kiya, jahaan se chaaron ko nyaayik hiraasat main bhondsi jail bhej diya gaya
 Police said that the four have confessed to involvement in several robbery and robbery incidents

 After this, the person who wanted to buy a car would call on the pretext of showing the car

 Police said that they used to call every customer in different areas on the pretext of showing the car
 lut kii in ghatnaon kaa kaaphi samay se khulaasa nahin ho paa rahaa tha
 Ultimately, the investigation of the case was handed over to the Crime Branch
 police pravaktaa rabindra kumaar ne bataaya ki giraftaar aropiyon ne lut kii 8 vaardaaton main shaamil hona kubul kiya he
 In this article we are assuming that the path of liberation for gay Indians (without any screws) is about to open soon, when the Supreme Court will throw a litter like Section 377 into the dustbin of history (certainly consenting adults In the case of)
 yah ek aisi ladaai he jo sabase pehle 1990 ke dashak ke madhya main adaalat main mukhar hui thi or 2001 main naaj foundation ke cese se isamen ubaal aayaa tha
 The mainstream media began to cover the issue of oppression of homosexuals and their freedom favorably
 bharatiyon kii ek aisi peedi badi hui jisamen samalangikta ke masale par kuch had tak samaj thi
 It is expected that many such people will have met some homosexual countryman
 dhara 377 kii damankaaree vyavastha se samalangik bhartiya kai vaastavik or dardanaak tareeke se peedit rahe hai
 It is often used by the police, rogue elements and even family members in bullying, extortion, sexual misconduct and violence against them
 aisa nahin he ki 377 khatm ho jane se yah sab puri tarah se band ho jayega, lekin yah kam ho jayega jaisaa ki saal 2009 main dilli hycourt ke vayaskon main paraspar sahmati se yon sambandh ko dhara 377 ke daayre se baahar karne ke faisle ke baad dekha gaya tha
 With the stigma of crime law removed, homosexuals will be able to more openly reveal who they are, they will be less victims of blackmailing, less fear of arrest and their family will also recover from the shame burden of such stigma (however, our heresy Even in society, respect or respect will matter more than the well-being and dignity of any gay relative)
 badhati samalangiktasupreme court ke kaushal jajment ke atyaachaar se hamen phir se apradhi bana dene se pehle 2009 se 2013 ke bich tamaam samalangik logon ne aazaadee kii pehali sugandh kaa anubhav lenaa shuru kiya tha
 He has, to some extent, revealed to family and comrades exactly what they are, he resisted (and even won) local goons' attempts to stop the mobilization of their community
 unhone gharon, college, online community, daftaron or anya saarvajanik jagahon par apane ko abhivyakt karnaa shuru kiya
 They were ordinary Indians - shopkeepers, rickshaw pullers, architects, bank workers, hotel workers, academics, sweepers, journalists, mechanics, domestic servants etc
 nihsandeh unke man main ek dar tha
 When 377 is completely removed, fear will remain
 lekin aazaadee kii shuruaati sugandh se hi dhire-dhire yah dabate hue lagbhag khatm ho jayega
 Because it is hoped that understanding and information will ultimately prevail over bigotry and ignorance
 samalangik logon main pehle se dar kam hoga, ve hataasha se behatar tareeke se ubar paaenge
 Which direction will freedom take — again there will certainly be resistance to it, even if it is gradually reduced — it will be up to the imagination and ability of gay people to live a full and dignified life in the most worldly way — someone Express your gender aspirations in a variety of ways, without fear of obscenity and censorship laws about health, sexuality and homosexuality To be published, have the freedom to be and to organize meetings is larynx without Howe won the public interest being to death
 bina bhedbhaav ke makaan le saken, shiksha or saarvajanik jagahon tak pahunch hasil kar saken, apane premi se prem karne or uske saath rahane kaa adhikaar ho yaa uske saath rahane kii aakanksha jaahir kar saken, sanyukt bank khate khol saken or sanyukt lone ke liye aavedan kar saken, chikitsiya jarurat par rajamandi ke liye partner ke pratinidhi ke rup main khadey ho saken or un 'chikitsakon' ke duvryavhaar ko chunauti de saken jo samalangik logon ko 'thik karne' ke liye kai tarah ke 'canvarjan therapy' kaa istemaal karte hai
 It is true that the independence of gay people depends largely on a free and democratic society, which applies to everyone, to every group of marginalized
 matdaan to aazaadee ko abhivyakt karne kaa keval ek tarika he, jo ki bahusnkhyakon kii ichha ko prakat karata he
 It does not turn into an autocracy, so it is imperative that this exercise be balanced with the guarantee of fundamental rights, which the courts, the executive and the legislature are protected
 lekin sansad main ek ulataa transgender bill laayaa gaya, jisamen is samudaay kii samaj kaa dhyaan nahin rakhaa gaya
 Independence is never absolute, but it is meant to draw a clear line in favor of the governed, which prevents the state and its representatives from controlling what we read, think, say, eat, What we wear, whom we marry, what work we do and who we associate with
 loktantr main in sabaki aazaadee milani chahie, lekin aksar nahin milti
 In our democracy we hope that now we will be able to participate in opposing such encroachment in a more sure manner, because now we are at the mouth of independence
 vivek dewan samalangikon ke maamalon or kanoon ke visheshgy hai tathaa dhara 377 ke khilaaf ladaai main agrani rahe

 rajyasabha main mangalvaar ko ek anokhaa maamla dekhne ko mila
 The entire opposition was absent during the discussion on the motion of thanks on the President's address
 aisa isliye hua, kyonki BSP ko chhodkar sabhi vipakshi partiyon ne rajyasabha ke sabhapati venkaiya naidu par pakshpatpurna vyavhaar kaa aarope lagaate hue ek din ke liye rajyasabha kaa bahishkaar kar diya
 This is the first time in recent years that the entire opposition has boycotted the proceedings of the House by accusing the Speaker of bias
 vipaksh ke netaa is baat se khaase naaraaz the ki sadan main jaraa sa hangaamaa hote hi sabhapati venkaiya naidu sidhe 2:00 baje tak ke liye rajyasabha ko sthagit kar dete hai, jisase shoonyakaal or prashnkaal donon khatm ho jaataa he
 After the boycott, coming out of the Rajya Sabha and coming to the media stand, the opposition leaders made their point
 rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki sarkaar vipaksh kii aawaaj ko dabaane main lagi hui he or vipaksh ke netaaon ko rajyasabha main bolne kaa mauka nahin diya ja rahaa he
 The Rajya Sabha proceedings are adjourned as soon as they want to raise an issue
 unke sthagan prastaav ko bhi manjuur nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 Samajwadi Party MP Naresh Agarwal also accused the government of suppressing the voice of the opposition, saying that neither those people are getting a chance to speak in Parliament nor the Rajya Sabha TV is showing the talk of the people of the opposition
 unhone kaha ki vipaksh kaa kaam sirf sarkaar ke bill paas karana nahin he, balki lokhit ke muddon ko sadan main uthaanaa bhi he
 Derek o'brien of the Trinamool Congress said that this is directly a murder of democracy
 mangalvaar subah trinmul congress ke derek o bryan nerajyasabhaamein notice diya tha or wo is baat ko uthaanaa chaahate the ki kis tarah pashchim bengal ke rajyapal kesharinath treepathi prashasan ke maamalon main dakhal de rahe hai or rajya sarkaar kii baat sunne ko taiyaar nahin he, lekin venkaiya naidu ne trinmul congress kaa notice naamanzoor kar diya tha
 In this way, the opposition was united against the Speaker by boycotting the House
 iske baad sabhapati venkaiya naidu ne safai dete hue kaha ki unka makasad yah bilkul nahin he ki vipaksh ke netaaon ko bolne kaa mauka nahin diya jaae
 He said that he actually adjourns the Rajya Sabha till noon, because the repeated adjournment of Rajya Sabha for a while gives the message that there is only ruckus in Rajya Sabha
 venkaiya naidu ne kaha ki unhen is baat kii chintaa he ki rajyasabha kii image desh ke logon ke man main kharaab ho rahi he aurasadanke prati logon kii vishwasaneeyata kam ho rahi he
 After cleaning of Venkaiah Naidu, Arun Jaitley also gave a statement on the matter on Tuesday evening
 media se baat karte hue arun jetali ne kaha ki vipaksh bina baat ke til kaa tad bana rahaa he or ek aisa vivaad khadaa karne kii koshish kar rahaa he, jo vastav main he hi nahin
 He said that the motion of thanks on the President's address and the budget is to be discussed in both the Houses of Parliament this whole week
 yah donon vishay aise hai, jinka dayera bahut bada he or vipaksh ke netaa agar chaahate to iske tahat apane manachaahe vishay par apni baat rakh sakate the
 He said that even during the motion of thanks on the President's address, the Leader of the Opposition could have raised the issue, but he is giving up the matter without talking

" yah congress ke liye mushkil vakt he
 There is no opinion in this

 As per the provisions of 'prohibition of Unfair Conduct in Technical Education Institutions, Medical Education Institutions and Universities Bill-2010', recovery of capitation fees would be a cognizable offense while other conduct would be non-cognizable and there would be some penalty
 iske saath hi unhone ‘rashtriya ucchtar shiksha sanstha pratyaayan viniamak praadhikaran vidheyak 2010’ bhi pesh kiya

 rangeen kapadon main team india kii kaman captain kool mahendra singh dhoni ke haathon main he or test main team india ko best banane kii jimmedaari viraat kohli ke kandhon par he
 Dhoni has retired from Test cricket, but Kohli plays in all three formats
 aise main donon ke bich vivaad kii khabaren pichley kaaphi samay se sunne-padhane ko mil rahi hai
 This speculation became even bigger when Kohli questioned the decisions taken on the field during his poor performance in the ODI series against Bangladesh
 donon hi captainon ko zimbabwe daure se aaraam diya gaya he or kaman ajinkya rahane ko saunp di gai he
 The dispute between Dhoni and Virat may have been lost or not, but Ajinkya Rahane has benefited from it
 saal 2007 main bhi aise hi halaat main dhoni ke haathon main team india kii kaman saunpi gai thi
 At that time players like Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar had sought rest and Dhoni grabbed the opportunity
 tab se unhone bhartiya cricket par ecchhatra raaj kiya he
 During this, he has also given the team the distinction of becoming a world winner in T20 and odis
 viraat kii uplabdhiyaan bhi kam nahin hai
 He has the ability to reverse the match on his own and if any batsman is seen close to the master blaster Sachin Tendulkar, then he is Kohli
 kohli se hi logon ko ummiden hai ki vah sachin ke record tod sakate hai
 Well, whatever happens, whether there is a dispute or not between Kohli and Dhoni, Ajinkya Rahane has benefited
 jahaan tak vivaad kii baat he to donon kai vigyapanon main saath aate hai vahaan to inke bich vivaad najar nahin aata or maidan par bhi aisa kuch dekhne ko nahin mila
 It may be that there is only speculation about the dispute and if that is the case then it is good for Indian cricket
 is bich bhartiya cricket team ke dressing room main sabhi chijen sahi hone kaa daawa karte hue bisisiai sachiv anuraag thakur or mukhya chayankarta sandip patil ne bhi dhoni va kohli ke bich matbhed kii khabaron ko khaarij kiya
 Patil insisted that the team is not divided
 zimbabwe daure ke liye bhartiya team kii ghoshnaa karne ke baad patil ne somvaar ko kaha, ‘isamen bhram kii sthiti nahin he
 We have not heard of such a thing
 vikram rathod or roger binni vahaan bangladesh daure par bhartiya team ke saath the or ham lagaataar team prabandhan ke sampark main the
 It is up to you to guess and write
 ’ After losing the bilateral series against Bangladesh for the first time, hearing the reaction of Kohli and Dhoni, it seemed as if the thinking of both is not the same
 lekin patil ne kaha ki logon ko match ke baad di gai pratikriya ko zyada tavajjo nahin deni chahie
 On the appointment of the Indian coach, Thakur said that the advisory committee of Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman would decide on the issue
 thakur ne kaha, ‘cricket salaahkaar samiti is par gaur kar rahi he or bhavishya ke coach ke naamon par vichaar kar rahi he
 We will discuss this issue during the meeting in the month of July
 ’tippaniyan On India's proposed visit to Pakistan in December this year, Thakur said, "no decision has been taken so far and the issue will be discussed in the BCCI meeting in July
" ’ (also from input language) yah atakalein us samay or zyada badi ho gayi, jab kohli ne bangladesh ke khilaaf vanade siries main lachar pradarshan ke dauraan maidan par liye faislon par sawaal uthaae
 Both captains have been rested from the Zimbabwe tour and the command has been handed over to Ajinkya Rahane
 dhoni or viraat ke bich vivaad kaa nuksaan bhale kisi ko hua ho yaa nahin, lekin ajinkya rahane ko iskaa phayda hua he
 In 2007, under the same circumstances, the command of Team India was handed over to Dhoni
 us samay rahul dravid or sachin tendulkar jaise khilaadiyon ne aaraam maanga tha or dhoni ne is maukey ko bhunaa liya
 Since then he has ruled Indian cricket unanimously
 is dauraan unhone team ko tii-20 va vanade main vishwa vijeta banane kaa gaurav bhi dilaayaa he
 The achievements of Virat are also no less
 unamem akele ke dam par match kaa rukh palatney kaa madda he or aaj kii taarikh main master blaster sachin tendulkar ke kareeb agar koi ballebaaj dikhataa he to vah kohli hi hai
 From Kohli itself, people are hoping that he can break Sachin's record
 khayr, jo bhi ho, kohli or dhoni ke bich bhale hi vivaad ho yaa naa ho ajinkya rahane ko phayda to ho hi gaya
 As far as the dispute is concerned, both of them come together in many advertisements, there is no dispute between them and nothing was seen on the field as well
 ho saktaa he vivaad kii baaten sirf atakalein hon or agar aisa he to ye bhartiya cricket ke liye acha hi he
 Meanwhile, in the dressing room of the Indian cricket team, claiming all things to be right, BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur and chief selector Sandeep Patil also dismissed reports of differences between Dhoni and Kohli
 patil ne jor dekar kaha ki team vibhajit nahin he
 After announcing the Indian team for the Zimbabwe tour, Patil said on Monday, "there is no confusion in this
" hamane aisi cheez ke bare main nahin suna he
 Vikram Rathore and Roger Binny were there with the Indian team on the Bangladesh tour and we were constantly in touch with the team management
 andaja lagaana or likhnaa aap logon par nirbhar karata he

 Thackeray said, 'after so many years, Kalam has lost his place in the hearts of the public by making such disclosure and now he is hypocritical and shallow in the eyes of the public
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘abhi tak, yahi anumaan lagaaya jaataa rahaa he ki raashtrapati ke taur par kalam ne sonia gandhi ko pradhanmantri banane se roak diya tha

 Just before 2019, the issue of Ram temple in Ayodhya is again gaining momentum
 sadhu-sant tark de rahe hai ki jab babari masjid dhahaane ke liye court ke aadesh kaa intjaar nahin kiya gaya, to ram mandir banane ke liye kyon adaalat kaa intjaar karen
 Saints from UP have filled the shout at the birth anniversary of Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, President of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kii maujuudagi main santon ne ram mandir banane kaa elaan kar diya he
 Modi at the Center, Yogi in the state and who will stop the member of the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas and former BJP MP Ram Vilas Vedanti clearly said that the saints of Ayodhya will no longer wait for the court, the temple construction will start before 2019
 unhone kaha ki jis tarah sadhu-santon ne babari giraane se pehle court kaa aadesh nahin liya gaya tha, usee tarah mandir banane ke liye court ke aadesh kaa intjaar nahin karenge
 Mahant Nritya Gopal Das and Sureshadas had also raised the question that there are yogis in UP and Center Modi, if not now, when will Ram temple be built, how long will yogi-modi make excuses
 ab nahin chalegi bahanebaajidigambar akhaada ke adhyaksh mahant sureshdas kaa kahana he ki modi ji ne kaha tha ki jab unki sarkaar banegi to mandir banegaa ab unki sarkaar centre main he, praant main unke mukhyamantri hai, governor hai, raashtrapati hai to ab pradhanmantri kii koi bahanebaaji nahin chalegi
 Yogi's statement Yogi Adityanath, who was not the Chief Minister of UP within the scope of the law, used to raise some voice about the temple, like the saints of Ayodhya are raising
 lekin ab wo soobe ke mukhyamantri hai
 He gave a politically correct statement on the temple
 kaha ki mandir banegaa, lekin kanoon ke daayre main
 What raised everyone from the development of everyone? This attitude of saints and saints has raised questions whether the BJP did not trust the slogan of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas
 gorakhpur, phulpur or kairana kii haar se ghayal bijepi kya ab maan chuki he ki jin mushkilon main wo fansi hui he, unase ab keval prabhu shriram hi use nikaal sakate hai
 That is why many months before the elections in Ayodhya, the chanting of the name Ram has started
 kya 2019 se pehle hoga mandir nirmaanyogi adityanath ke ayodhya daure se pehle hi ayodhya main sadhu-santon ke bich mandir kii dhun bajane lagi thi
 Today Ram Vilas Vedanti, a senior member of the Trust and former BJP MP, made it clear that before 2019, the construction of Ram temple will begin in Ayodhya
 upi main yogi adityanath kii sarkaar banane ke baad ayodhya par kai baar baatcheet kaa maahaul bana, lekin ab santon or babari ke pakshakaron ke sur badalte najar aa rahe hai
 Lord Sri Ram has been a big troubleshooter for BJP, Shriram has been a troubleshooter for BJP
 jab-jab bijepi sankat main aati he, use ram naam yaad aane lagata he
 Where BJP has lost in consecutive by-elections in UP before the 2019 Ran
 karnataka main bijepi bahumat ke paas aakar thahar gai, to aise main sawaal he ki kya bijepi kaa raamji bedaa paar karenge
 Diplomatic yogi yogi Adityanath is the self-styled guard of Hindutva at the temple
 unke guru mahant avaidhyanath mandir andolan se jude rahe hai
 Now Yogi Adityanath is the Chief Minister of the government with an absolute majority in UP, he goes to Ayodhya equally
 lekin sant jab poochhate hai ki mandir kab banegaa, yogi diplomatic ho jate hai
 The issue of Ram temple in Ayodhya is an issue of two mps with an absolute majority on the strength of the temple, which has made the BJP go from two Lok Sabha seats to an absolute majority in the center
 upi main yogi sarkaar banane ke baad mandir ke liye gatividhiyaan tej ho gai hai
 New advocates of the temple have started coming forward
 art of living ke adhyaksh shrishri ravishankar ne bengalooru main shiya muslim vakf board ke adhyaksh wasim rizvi se mulaakaat kii
 After that, the wishes of the construction of Shree Shree's temple became feathers
 shrishri ayodhya gayi, lekin vahaan unhen apane makasad main kamyaabi nahin mili
 a day before Yogi Adityanath's visit to Ayodhya, Wasim Rizvi reached the shelter of Mahant Nritya Gopal Das
 formula diya ki mandir bane ayodhya main, masjid lakhanu main bane
 50 per cent of the work of the temple has been completed, for the last 26 years in Ayodhya, Ramlala has been waiting for a house for himself under the tarpaulin

 50 percent work has also been completed

 But they also want to know when the temple will be built
 ram naam kii he bijepi ko darkanyodhya main ram mandir kaa masalaa ab siyaasi ho chukaa he, jo chunaavon se pehle aksar jor martha he
 The BJP, when weakened, runs into the shelter of Shri Ram, when it is strong, it stays with Ram

 Former captain Sourav Ganguly, who described Virender Sehwag on the field as India's best opening batsman in Tests after Sunil Gavaskar, said the Delhi batsman was unaware of his existence outside the field

 As Indians, we are human beings who like comfort

 He used to sleep and you had to wake him up repeatedly before a test match
 'ganguli ne kaha, 'jab bharat 2001 main australia main khel rahaa tha tab maine dekha kii yah alag team he or ladane ke liye taiyaar he
 So as a captain, i had to create the atmosphere on the field that i had to start
 'ganguli ne kaha ki team chayan pehle kii apeksha ab zyada paardarshee ho gaya he
 He said, 'the selection process has now become more transparent than before
 aap jab ab kii bhartiya team ko dekhte hai or viraat kohli jaise eemaandaar tathaa jununee captain ko dekhte hai to aap ko pataa chalata he ki yah kitna paardarshee he
 Ganguly said, "he watches the players carefully
" har koi galati karata he jo maanya bhi hoti he
 You can see the result of how India is progressing

 aazaadee ke liye apane athak prayaason kii vajah se netaji kaa jitna gungan hota he utani hi charchaa unki rahasyamayi maut kii bhi hoti he
 Film director Shreejit Mukherjee has made a film on Netaji's Death Mystery
 iskaa tiger 15 agast ko jari kiya gaya
 While on one hand the teaser of the film is being liked by the people, on the other hand, the family members of Netaji have objected to it
 india today se khaas baatcheet ke dauraan film ke diarector ne film se jude vibhinn pahaluon or punap rahe nae vivaad ke bare main baaten kin
 How much do you agree with the allegations made by the Bose family? As you know, he has accused your film that through this film, the work of tarnishing Netaji's image has been done
 is par aapkaa kya riection he?is par srijith mukherjee ne kaha- main shuruyaat main aapako subhaashachandr bose se judi teen sabase zyada charchit theories bataanaa chahta hum
 The first is plane clash theory
 duusari he rashia main unki maut or teesri he gumnami baba theory
 Talking about plane clash theory, apart from Sugata Bose, no member of the Bose family believes in this theory
 netaji ke bade bhai ne bhi is baat ko marate dam tak mana tha ki netaji jinda hai
 Even Netaji's wife never believed in these death theories
 netaji ke grand nefyu surya kumaar bose kaa maananaa he ki netaji ko rus main dhime-dhime jehar de kar maaraa gaya
 Even when Surya went to Allahabad court and saw Gumnami Baba's goods, he realized that this stuff belonged to Netaji
 iske alaava main netaji ke parivaar ke kuch or sadasyon se mila to mujhe pataa chalaa ki ve gumnami baba vaali theory ko lekar kaaphi uljhan main hai
 But at one time he also feels that Gumnami Baba is Netaji
 aise main ve plane klesh vaali theory par yakeen nahin rakhte
 If we go beyond Netaji's family and go to some researchers, Jayant Chaudhary, Anuj Dhar and Chandrachur Ghosh are names who consider plane crash theory to be a story
 jahaan tak film ke tital kii baat he to iskaa naam gumnami baba rakhane kaa matlab ye nahin he ki film kii kahani gumnami baba par aadhaarit he balki ye judi hui he mukherjee kamishan procedings se jahaan par teen alag alag kism kii theories kaa zikr he
 Teaser of the film - So are you saying that your film does not claim that Netaji was Gumnami Baba as stated in the novel on which your film is made? The job of a filmmaker is not to ask questions and not to answer it
 give
 to is film ke jariye main koi nirnay yaa jawaab nahin de rahaa hum
 i have raised legitimate questions related to Netaji's death on the basis of all three theories, following only the Mukherjee Commission Proceedings
 maine ant main baqayda ye bhi saaf taur par jaahir kar diya he ki is baat kaa koi bhi pramaan he hi nahin jo ye bataa sake ki netaji hi gumnami baba the
 So are you trying to say that your film only presents Netaji's mysterious death in more detail? Yes
 mamata banerjee ne bhi twit ke jariye ye baat kahi thi ki hamen ye jaanane kaa haq he ki aakhir netaji kii maut kaise hui
 However, she too does not believe in plane crash theory, and she believes that there is a deep secret behind Netaji's death
 or meri film thik aisa hi karti hui najar aa rahi he
 i believe that in a free country a filmmaker has every right to ask questions
 aapaki film par aise aarope bhi lag rahe hai ki aapane film ke madhyam se netaji kii image ko ek rhite wing hindu nesanalist leader ke taur par pesh karne kii koshish kii he
 How much truth is there in this? Absolutely not
 meraa angeda sirf itnaa he ki netaji ke bare main charchaa hi nahin hui, unhen bhula diya gaya
 They were simply limited to the idol made in Kalakta
 ek bengali hone ke naate ye meraa adhikaar he ki main unki maut ko lekar prashn karun
 My question is why the Mukherjee Commission report was rejected by the government
 ye ek political film he or iskaa agenda saaf he ki is film ke jariye hamen netaji kii deth se judi charchaaon ko phir se jinda karnaa he jo ekadam se gaayab ho gai hai
 In the last, let me tell you what kind of challenges are you facing about the film in the present time? Will your film be released? The film is on full track
 hamaari taraf se legal notij jari kar di gai he or is par valeekon dwaara jawaab bhi aa gaya he
 The film is in no way showing Netaji as Gumnami Baba
 bas ye netaji kii maut se jude hue teen sawaal khadey kar rahi he
 i have invited Chandra Kumar Bose for the film
 mere hisaab se jo koi bhi netaji ko maanata he unhen pasand karata he wo is film ko jarur dekh saktaa he

 The storm in Apoorva's heart had stopped
 pati kii bevafaayee or andekhi ne apurva ko is kadar jhakzor diya tha ki usne apane haathon se apana suhaag ujaad diya

 Earlier in March 2018, this figure was around 18 lakh crores
 vahiin march 2017 main karansi cirkulation kareeb 13 lakh karod tha
 Whereas currency circulation around 16 in the economy in March 2016, just before demonetisation
 41 lakh karod tha
 This means that the currency circulation has increased by Rs 8 lakh crore within 3 years of demonetisation
 is saal march tak karansi cirkulation kaa ye aankada notebandi se pehle (march 2016) se bhi adhik he
 What was the question? Sajda Ahmed, TMC MP from Uluberia parliamentary seat of West Bengal, asked whether currency circulation has increased after demonetisation as compared to pre-demonetisation? Along with this, Sajda Ahmed also asked for its details
 isi sawaal ke jawaab main anuraag thakur ne karansi cirkulation ke aankade pesh kiye
 Along with this, Anurag Thakur also gave details of confiscation of counterfeit notes since demonetisation
 is aankade se maaloom hota he ki sabase adhik jaali note 200 rupee ke pakade gaye hai
 However, the number of seizure of fake currency notes of 2000 rupees has decreased

 However, in the year 2017, the Reserve Bank had said that about 99 percent of the notes have been returned

 yahi vajah he ki kai baar saarvajanik taur par kehete rahe hai ki samaajwaadiyon ko wo ekajute karke secular morcha banaaenge, jiske adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav honge
 But now instead of forming a front, the exercise of forming a new party has started
 sapa sangrakshak mulaayam singh aaj nai party kaa elaan kar sakate hai, jisamen netaji ke sipahsalaar shivpal yadav honge
 Akhilesh planted Shivpal's whereabouts
 Before the assembly elections, Akhilesh along with uncle Ram Gopal Yadav planted Shivpal Yadav's whereabouts
 itnaa hi nahin party kii kaman bhi apane haathon main le lee thi
 Not only this, Akhilesh has shown the way to the people of Shivpal from the organization after the election
 party ab puri tarah se akhileshmay he
 Khatabas have grown so much that Shivpal and Mulayam Singh did not attend the party's state-level conference held in Lucknow on Saturday
 lohia trust par shivpal kaa varchasvshivpal mulaayam ke sahare akhilesh ko raajnneetik maat dene kii kavayad kar rahe hai
 On Thursday, Mulayam sacked Ram Gopal from the post of secretary of Lohia Trust and replaced Shivpal Yadav as secretary
 pehle bhi akhilesh ke kareebi chaar sadasyon ko trust se bedakhal kar diya
 It stars Ram Govind Chaudhary, Usha Verma, Ashok Shakya and Ahmed Hasan
 sapa sangrakshak mulaayam singh ne in chaar sadasyon kii jagah shivpal ke chaar karibiyon ko sadsy banaaya
 Among them, Deepak Mishra, Ram Naresh Yadav, Ram Sevak Yadav and Rajesh Yadav were made members
 netaji banaaenge nai party- shivpal samarthakamulaayam singh yadav somvaar ko bada faisla lene ja rahe hai
 Mohammad Shahid, a former SP spokesman and considered close to Shivpal Yadav, aajtak
 in se kaha, "sampradayik shaktiyaan lagaataar apana pair pasaarti ja rahi hai or koi bhi party uske mukaable khadi nahin ho rahi he
 It is also included in the SP led by Akhilesh Yadav
 aise main ek party kii sakht jarurat he, jiskaa elaan netaji aaj karenge
 All SP leaders will be angry with Akhilesh
 shivpal ke dabaav main nahin jhuke akhileshdansal pichley kaaphi samay seshivpal lagaataar mulaayamake sahare akhilesh ko target par lete rahe hai, lekin abhi tak unhen kamyaabi nahin mil saki thi
 Ever since the Assembly election debacle, Shivpal has been publicly saying that the party should be given the command of Mulayam Singh Yadav, but Akhilesh has clearly said that he is and will remain the president of the party
 party kii kaman kisi ko nahin denge
 Not only this, in order to put pressure on Akhilesh, he also chanted the formation of a separate party
 par akhilesh ke iraade main koi badlaav nahin aayaa
 After this news came that Shivpal can go to BJP camp
 is par bhi akhilesh khamoshi akhriyaar kiye rahe
 As a result, Shivpal Yadav has laid the board for Mulayam to form his own political party
 mulaayam ke vaaris ke taur akhilesh kii bani pahachaanmulaayam singh yadav ke sahare shivpal bhale hi raajnneetik party bana len, lekin apana vajood kitna sthapit kar paaenge ye bada sawaal he
 Because as Mulayam's heir, Akhilesh Yadav has succeeded to a great extent in making his identity and the Yadav society of the state has also accepted him as its leader
 espi ke wo rashtriya adhyaksh bhi ban chuke hai
 From Azam Khan to Ramgopal, Ramgovind Chaudhary, Naresh Aggarwal and Kiran Nanda are with Akhilesh
 kinake sahare shivpal banaaenge jagahnai party bhale hi mulaayam bana rahe hon, lekin vah shivpal kii maani jaaegi
 Shivpal has been the man of the organization, the SP has a good hold in the organization
 lekin shivpal kin saathiyon ke sahare apni jagah banaaenge ye badi chunauti hogi, kyonki netaji ke zyaadaatar kareebi akhilesh ke saath ho chuke hai
 Shivpal's image is also well known
 in sabake baad bhi shivpal akhilesh ke liye sirdard jarur banenge
 The crime investigation department (CID) of the police has questioned bjp's national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya in Indore in the famous case related to child trafficking in Jalpaiguri, West Bengal
 vijayawargeey bijepi sanghathan main pashchim bengal maamalon ke prabharee mahasachiv hai or indore main rahete hai

 sharma ne yah kehete hue vistrut byora dene main asamarthta jaahir ki maamalapaschim bengal pulicese judaa he
 What's the matter West Bengal CID revealed a gang of child trafficking in Jalpaiguri last year

 Juhi Chaudhary, then general secretary of the BJP Mahila Morcha's West Bengal unit, was also arrested along with some others in the case

 Rupa Ganguly was also questioned
 Meanwhile, a spokesman of Vijayvargiya's local office said that the Trinamool Congress government of West Bengal wanted to implicate the BJP general secretary in the matter due to political enmity

 In the case of Varun Gandhi, the BJP has opened a front against both the Congress government at the Center and the Mayawati government of Uttar Pradesh
 duusari ore congress ne basapa se duuri dikhaani shuru kar di he
 Perhaps the Congress is afraid that the BJP may not win
 varun gandhi par neshnal security act lagaakar basapa supremeo mayawati ne tagada hathaudaa maar diya he, jisaki chot se bhaajapa tilamila uthi he
 The Congress is also afraid that the BSP may go ahead in the race for votes
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki congress basapa ko bhaajapa ke liye naram bataa rahi he, jabaki bhaajapa ko isamen centre or rajya sarkaar kii mileebhagat ke saath-saath gandhi parivaar kii sajeesh bhi najar aa rahi he
 By the way, the arrows of the BJP are more on Mayawati
 party ne basapa ko unke ummidavaaron kii aapraadhik prishthbhumi bhi ginane lagi he
 "the crew is safe and no injuries are reported," he said
 ’’ BJP has reacted sharply to Congress leader Shashi Tharoor's statement of 'hindu Pakistan'
 is maamle par bijepi pravaktaa sambit paatra ne kaha, 'hindu pakistan' shabd kaa prayog karke congress party ne hindustan ke loktantr or desh ke hinduon par prahaar kiya he
 Rahul Gandhi should apologize to Tharoor's statement
 'bharat ko nicha dikhaane kaa kaam karte hai congress netaa'sambit paatra ne kaha, 'shashi tharur kaa kahana ki agar 2019 main bhaajapa sarkaar banaati he to bharat 'hindu pakistan' ban jayega
 There can be no more objectionable subject for India
 'hindu pakistan' shabd kaa prayog karke congress party ne hindustan ke loktantr or desh ke hinduon par prahaar kiya he
 Patra said, "while hating Modi ji and the BJP, the Congress party has crossed the Laxman Rekha and started speaking against the democracy of Hindustan and Hindustan
" congress party ke netaa apni tuchh raajnneeti ke liye bharat ko nicha dikhaane kaa kaam karte hai
 Shashi Tharoor is not the first leader in the Congress
 manishankar ayyar or rahul gandhi bhi pehle bharat ke khilaaf bayaan de chuke hai
 Sambit Patra said, 'BJP questions how right it is to attack India's dignity
 shashi tharur agar aap pakistan ke nagarikon se pyaar karnaa chaahate hai to kariye, lekin bharat ko nicha mat dikhaaen
 'patra said,' Muslims apologize to intellectuals for visiting Rahul Gandhi temple
 rahul jo mandir jane kaa naatak karte hai, ye zyada din nahin chalegaa
 The Congress cannot leave the politics of appeasement
 'desh ko todane vaala he tharur kaa bayaan: mahesh sharmaavahin, kendriya mantri mahesh sharma ne shashi tharur ke bayaan par kaha, 'yah bayaan desh ko baantne or todane vaala he
 The Congress is in its worst phase and its own people are doing the work of putting a nail in its coffin
 ye log desh ko baantnaa chaahate hai
 Want to divide the society
 aisa kataaksh karnaa uchit nahin he
 On Rahul Gandhi meeting with Muslim intellectuals, Mahesh Sharma said that 'rahul Gandhi is not taken seriously in his party
 vah apni chhavi se baahar nahin nikal paa rahe
 The people of the country have rejected the politics of their familism
 rahul gandhi ke liye or unki party liye ab kuch nahin he
 They are making the last attempt
 unki koi bhi gatividhi, koi bhi prayaas unki party or desh ko aage le jane vaala nahin he
 'what did Shashi Tharoor say? Let us tell, former Union Minister Shashi Tharoor said that' If the BJP wins the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, then the Constitution of India will be in danger
 bharat 'hindu pakistan' ban jayega
 bjp's victory will put democratic values in danger

 ' Badana Devi Dagga, an 82-year-old resident of Bikaner in Rajasthan, decided to fast until death on July 16, following the Jain community's religious ritual Santhara or authoring
 10 agast ko unke annarahit upwas kaa 26waan din tha or unke parijanon samet jain muni unhen jal se bhi vanchit kar unki maut kaa intjaar kar rahe the, tabhi aisa kuch hua ki yah 'dharmik kaary' ekadam se tham gaya
 On the same day, the Rajasthan High Court declared the practice of Santhara illegal, after which the practice was considered a crime of attempted suicide under Article 309 of the Indian Penal Code
 or ab aisa prayaas karne vaale vyakti kii madad karne waalon par bhi ipisi kii dhara 306 ke tahat aatmahatya ke liye uksaane kaa maamla banegaa
 The High Court said in its order that "the state government will have to stop and root out the trend of Santhara and Sankhlana which are running in the Jain community
" is tarah ke maamle main milane vaali kisi bhi shikaayat ko aapraadhik maamle ke taur par darj kiya jayega
 "this decision has come on the petition of human rights activist Nikhil Soni
 yah yachika unhone 2006 main apane vakil madhav mitra ke jariye daayar kii thi
 Chief Justice Sunil Ambwani and Justice V
 es
 a two-member bench of Siradhana has said in the judgment that "santhara is not a compulsory policy of Jainism," but with this decision, the box of problems also opened up
 24 agast ko jab badana devi kaa mrityuparyant upwas chalisven din main pahunch gaya or bikaner kii hi ek jain sadhvi sundar kanvar kii santhara shuru karne ke tisare hi din maut ho gai to kai shaharon main dharmik netaaon samet samudaay ke hajaaron log virodh pradarshan karne sadakon par utar aae
 Though Santhare is said to be an important part of Jainism, not a single case has been reported till date when any elder Jain monk has adopted the path of Santharay to end his life
 yahaan tak ki jain dharm ke pramukh dharmik sant acharya tulsi, jinka 1997 main nidhan ho gaya tha or na hi unki dharmik viraasat ke vaaris acharya mahaprajna, jinaki 2010 main mrityu ho gai thi, donon main se kisi ne bhi svaichhik maut kaa rasta nahin chunaa tha, balki donon dharmaguruon kii mrityu lambii beemaari ke baad hui thi
 In the Jain community, people who accept voluntary death, post-death fast or santhara are mostly aged and most of them are also seriously ill and are counting their last breaths
 aise logon ko santhare ke liye taiyaar kiya jaataa he, or aksar unki ichha ke viruddh
 Even some such instances will be found in which the pressure of voluntary death was put on the children too
 santhare par banta samajasamajavigyaani rashmi jain is tarah kii ichha mrityu ko ''paagalpan or sanak se bharaa dharmik krity'' qaraar detii hai
 She equates Santhara with the practice of Sati which is now considered illegal
 unki tarah jain samudaay ke kai log hai jo adaalat ke faisle kaa samarthan kar rahe hai, haalanki samudaay kaa ek bada tabaka isaki aalochana kar rahaa he
 Social and cultural activist Sandeep Bhootodiya says, "I think Santhara is inhuman
 '' ve yah bhi kehete hai, ''iskaa aam taur par galat istemaal hota rahaa he
 Those who are not able to live long due to any disease are forced to go hungry in the name of religious tradition
 ''akhil bhartiya jain jagriti parishad ke mahasachiv maan singh khandela to santhare ko jain dharm ke dharmik sandeshon ke thik vipareet bataate hai
 He says, "it is natural that people who help someone adopt or follow a santhara are also actually provoking him to commit suicide
 '' ve kehete hai, anek dharmik sanghathanon kii ore se jabardast virodh ke baavjood adaalaton ne mandiron main pashuon kii bali dene par roak lagaai thi
 Khandela says, "whether Sati or Santhara, you cannot give life to anyone, then you do not even have the right to end it
" ''rajasthan ke sikar jile ke devrala gaanv main 1987 main jab ek kishoravay vidhwaa rup kanvar apane pati kii chita par sati ho gai or hajaaron kii sankhya main logon ne vahaan ikaitha hokar iskaa jashn manaaya tab sati pratha ke virodh main ek vishesh adhinium laayaa gaya tha, iskaa bhi deshbhar main baari virodh hua tha
 Since independence, only eight cases of sati were reported in Rajasthan till 1987
 iske mukaable santhare ke maamle kahin zyada hai
 According to the traditionalists, the number of such voluntary deaths touches 300 every year
 adaalat ke faisle ke aalochak bhi isi ore sanket karte hai
 Describing Santhara as distinctly different from the practice of sati and suicide in lofty tones, critics of this decision warn that it may spark people's anger against politics and the court, as opposed to the 1987 ban on sati
 tejatarraar jain muni tarun sagar kehete hai, ''santhara aavesh main aakar kiya jane vaala kaam nahin he
 It is an eternal action in which a person takes 12 years to completely give up food
 '' ek anya jain muni pramaan sagar ise jainiyon ke mul dhyaan or chintan kaa hissaa maanate hai
 a wave of outrage reached the Jain society of Bundelkhand after the suzerainty of the High Court of Boiling in Bundelkhand was given suicide status
 lalitpur ke jain samudaay ke pandrah hajaar se zyada logon ne adaalat ke faisle ke virodh main pradarshan karte hue apane sir mundava liye or andolan khadaa kar diya
 Many political parties are also with the community on this issue
 purv kendriya gramin vikaas rajya mantri or congress netaa pradeep jain bhi is samuhik mundan kaa hissaa bane
 It did not take any time for the issue to take a political color and on the very next day of mass Mundan, BJP MLA Ravi Sharma from Jhansi Sadar seat also supported the Jain community by shaving heads in the Collectorate premises
 samuhik mundan ke taur par shuru hua virodh pradarshan ab bade andolan kii shakl letaa ja rahaa he
 Everyday, a large number of Jain community people are donning cash in the collective Mundan movement in Ata temple of Lalitpur
 pradeep jain kehete hai, ''rajasthan hycourt ne santhare ko aatmahatya kii shrenee main rakhane kaa jo faisla diya he, vah durbhagyapurna he
 Jain society follows the principle of Ahimsa Paramo Dharma
 jahaan ek cheentee ko maarna bhi paap kii shrenee main mana jaataa ho vahaan koi kisi ko aatmahatya jaise aparaadh ke liye kaise uksaa saktaa he?'' jain kehete hai ki is faisle se samaaj ke log aahat hai or is maamle main rajasthan sarkaar or pradhanmantri ko aage aakar hycourt ke faisle ko waapas lene kaa anurodh karnaa chahie
 He warns that if this does not happen, a big movement will take place across the country to save religion
 dharm guruon or netaaon kii tarah jain samudaay ke kai nami giraami log bhi adaalat ke faisle kii aalochana kar rahe hai
 Some of these former judges, former head of the Securities and Exchange Board of India D
 aar
 Mehta, Rajasthan Home Minister Gulabchand Kataria and Rajasthan BJP chief Ashok Parnami are also included
 kataaria ne to jain samudaay se is maamle main kanoon kaa sahaara lene kaa aahvaan kiya he or paranami 24 agast ko jaipur main jain samudaay ke virodh pradarshan main shaamil bhi hue the
 However, the people of the community are aware that the mere protest will not affect the judicial process
 isliye hycourt or supreme court main punarvichaar yachika or apilen daal di gai hai
 Here Badana Devi is merely living on water (this report was written on 27 August), the issue is getting cracks and widening and differences are getting deeper
 unke parijanon or samudaay ke anya logon ko bharosa he ki santhare ke maamle main sarvocch adaalat tarksangat tareeke se vichaar karegi
 Whereas those who oppose this practice believe that the number of people who adopt willful death is so low that religion will not be harmed by discontinuing this tradition
 lekin sabase bada sawaal yah he ki jo sarkaar november 2000 se sashastr bal vishesh shakti adhinium (eeffesbie) ke khilaaf bhukh hadtaal kar rahi manipur kii ectvist irom sharmila ko jabaran khilaa rahi he, vah dharm ke naam par hone vaali is bhukh hadtaal ko rokane ke liye kya koi kadam uthaa paaegi?(saath main santosh pathak) Google's new Android Marshmallow update has started getting in some smartphones

 Police has made day and night
 lekin abhi tak ye maamle ansulajhe hai
 Now the question arises that will the investigative agencies and police be able to solve the puzzle of these cases in the new year? Singh, along with a team of around 9 people, reached the spot from the Government Tata Sumo UP 13 AG 0452

 Whose charge first came on Yogesh Raj

 And now the police has arrested a young man named Prashant Nut, who is accused of murder in this case

 In this same dreadful game of death was also written

 In which it was revealed that people of Bhatia family were not willing to commit suicide
 unki maut ek haadasa he, yani galati se us parivaar ke sabhi log mar gaye
 Taftish was also making the same gesture
 parivaar or rishtedaaron se baatcheet kii gai
 Medical records were viewed
 iske baad police or sibiai is nirnay par pahunche
 However, this case is still such a mystery, which is yet to be answered

 9000 non-executive employees of the metro have threatened to go on strike from 30 June

 His demands are the same as before

 ' unhone bataaya ki prabandhan ne yah vaada kiya tha ki 13,500-25,520 grad kaa 14,000-26,950 grad ke saath vilay kiya jayega, lekin yah nahin hua
 The union has warned that there is no obstruction of service so far due to the protests, but if the demands are not met by June 29, then the work will stop completely from June 30

 This time Diwali is different for the people of delhi-ncr, this time there will be neither the noise of firecrackers nor the light of pomegranate and chakri
 lekin badhate pradooshan par lagaam lagane ke liye uthaae gaye is kadam ne dilli-ensiaar ke dooshit hawa par zyada fark padegaa aisa hota nahin dikhataa
 a day before Diwali, the pollution figures have started showing shocking
 dilli pradooshan niyantran cameti ne 10 steshnon par air quality maapne kii vyavastha kii he
 But the figures that have come out are enough to tell how pollution has broken all records even before Diwali in Delhi
 agar ham aankadon par najar daalen to chaunkaane vaala pahalu yah he ki dilli ke tamaam alag-alag ilaakon main pradooshan kaa str saamaanya se 9 guna tak zyada ho gaya he
 In such a situation, it is not difficult to understand how much difference will be made with the ban on firecrackers
 dilli-noida or gurugram ke alag alag bazaaron main ajtak ne jab logon se is par unki raay janani chaahi to sabane ek sur main pataakho par lage bain kaa samarthan to kiya par pradooshan str par chintaa jaahir kii
 Sarojini Nagar Market Delhi's Sarojini Nagar Market is buzzing with people who come to shop for Diwali, where on one side the faces of the shopkeepers of the emerging market are blossoming, while there is disappointment among the children and youth who crave firecrackers
 uttam nagar se aaye 14 saal ke piyush ne kaha " bina pataakhon ke diwaali kisi? ye thik he ki polyushan zyada ho gaya he par kya pataakhe sirf diwaali par bain karne se sab thik ho jaayegaa, aisa he to shaadi yaa duusare maukey par bhi pataakhon ko bain karnaa chahie, teb polyushan nahin hoga kya?"
 Noida Atta Bazaar: There is also an uproar in the Atta Bazaar of Noida, but there are also firecrackers from the market here
 haalanki noida or aas-paas ke ilaakon ke log dilli ke sadar bazaar or chandani chowk se pataakhon kii kharidari karte he par kuch had tak atta market main bhi pataakhon kaa bazaar khub sajata he, par is baar yahaan logon main maayusi he
 Varun, a resident of Noida's Sector 56, says, "if firecrackers are banned, then how are the buyers buying, they are getting crackers in every market, but yes due to this ban, their rates have doubled, shoppers The earnings have doubled
 Just, the man who bought the firecrackers for his 2-year-old son in 2000 last year is for 3500, this time, all is getting banned is just getting stolen at a high price, to rob the common people
 Banned for That's it "
 gurugram sadar bazargurugram kaa sadar bazaar dilli ke sadar bazaar kii tarah hi kharidaaron se khachaa khach bhar he
 Sameer ji, who came here with his daughter, says "firecrackers were banned, it was a waste of money and relief from unnecessary noise and pollution, although the ban was not necessary, people should have taken this initiative themselves, Today we will plant saplings around my house with my daughter, this is what i came to take, it is important to connect the children with the environment because the pollution figures are worrying "
 dilli-ensiaar ke alag alag ilaakon se logon ne pataakhon par bain kaa swaagat to kiya he par zyaadaatar yaheen maanate he ki pataakhon ke pradooshan par zyada fark nahin padegaa, or diwaali ke ek din pehle aaye pradooshan control kamity ke aakadon ne ye baat sabit kar di he
 In a board meeting on Monday, the Delhi Transport Authority decided that it would be mandatory to install stickers detailing child lock system in every taxi or cab run in the capital
 ap besd taxi services main mahilaon ke saath hui chhedchhad or rape kii vaardaaton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ye kadam uthaaya gaya he
 In Delhi, now the same cab will be given a permit to walk, which will have these stickers
 cabper lagane vaale stikers par child lock system sambandhit sabhi jaankaree honi chahie
 Also, the way to unlock it should also be written
 motor license aphis ko bhi jald hi is babat suchit kar diya jaayegaa ki un taxi yaa cab ko permit na diya, jinamein ye stikers nahin lage hai
 The Delhi government is preparing to issue notifications on this
 dillimhila ayog ke suzav ke baad ye kadam uthaaya gaya he
 Delhi Women's Commission chairperson Swati Jaihind says that there is no need for child locks in cabs and cabs, especially when a single woman or girl is traveling
 child lock ke rahete cab main mahilaayein surakshit nahin rahati hai
 If the driver wishes, he can do anything with the woman on a lonely deserted road
 isliye hamaara maananaa he ki child lock cab main hona hi nahin chahie
 The Delhi Women's Commission is in favor of completely removing the child lock feature from the cab
 agar aisa nahin hota he, to cab main ye stikers kam se kam mahila savaariyon ko child lock se sambandhit sabhi jaankaree denge
 Most people do not know what is child lock? Therefore, the information to lock or unlock it is very important
 dilli main har roj kareeb do lakhcabachalati hai
 In such a situation, by declaring this rule, its responsibility will be handed over to Delhi Traffic Police and Transport Department

 One of the films released this week is Jackie Shroff's son Tiger Shroff's debut film 'heropanti', which is directed by Sabir Khan and stars Tiger Kriti Sanon, Prakash Raj and Sandipa Dhar
 
 
 'heropanti' kii kahani jat-bahul ilaake, yani 'jatland' kii prishthbhumi par gumti he, jisamen ek choudhary parivaar basaa he
 
 
 Chaudhary Sahab, ie Prakash Raj is the head of this family, and he has a lot of influence over the entire village
 
 
 choudhary sahab kii badi beti hai renu, yani sandipa dhar or choti beti hai kriti
 
 
 Renu runs away with her boyfriend Rakesh on her wedding day and helps him to escape, one of his friends, Bablu, ie Tiger Shroff
 
 
 aage kya hota he, yah jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni hogi
 
 
 Now let's talk about the shortcomings and merits of the film
 
 
 'heropanti' se tiger shroff filmi duniya main entry le rahe hai, so, zaahir he, film main unke hunar kii sho-reel to banani hi thi
 
 
 Tiger specializes in action, and the film also featured good action
 
 
 tiger dance main bhi achche hai, lekin acting main mujhe vah abhi kachche nazar aae
 
 
 Do not hold high expectations from the film's story
 
 
 film main kabhi aapako tiger ke pita jaiki shroff kii 'hero', or kabhi yash chopra kii 'dilavaale dulhaniya le jaaenge' kii jhalak dikhegi
 
 
 The screenplay of the film is fine
 
 
 jab tak tiger screen par hote hai, film main jaan dikhti he, or baaki kaman sanbhale rahe hai prakaash raaj, jinke kuch seens film main kaabil−e−tarif hai
 
 
 If Prakash Raj's character did not show skill in the second half of the film, the film might have been bored
 
 
 kriti sinan thik-thaak hai, or koi khaas chhap nahin chhod paatin
 
 
 Sabir Khan's direction was weak
 
 
 film ke gane thik-thaak hai
 
 
 Come to me overnight
 
 
 ' or 'visal baja
 
 
 'look good
 
 
 film ke becoground score main jab aap puraani 'hero' kii bansuri kii dhun ko nae andaaz main sunenge to 'hero' film se judi yaaden tazaa hongi or tiger ko bataur hero dekhne ke bajaae shaayad darshak unhen jaiki shroff ke bete kii tarah screen par dekhenge
 
 
 It might be good for this film, but i think Tiger will have to go beyond that and make his mark
 
 
 mujhe yah bhi lagata he ki apni aane vaali do filmon main shaayad vah thodaa or nikharenge, lekin 'heropanti' main tiger mujhe kachche dikhe
 
 
 Overall 'heropanti' can entertain you, and can be seen once
 
 
 meri taraf se is film kii reating he - 2
 5 stars

 a person from Indore bought 12 bottles of Sprite for his child's birthday party, out of which a worm was found in a closed bottle
 shaks ne upabhokta forum ne shikaayat darj kii or company ko harjaana chukaane ko kaha
 Let me tell you, the case is 10 years old
 saal 2009 main shikaayat darj kii gai thi
 The Consumer Forum has imposed a compensation of Rs 25,000 on four sides, including Hindustan coca-cola Beverages, the bottling arm of beverage maker coca-cola India
 jila upabhokta vivaad pratithoshan forum (district Consumer Dispute Recruitment Forum) ke adhyaksh omprakash sharma or is forum ke sadsy atul jain ne yah faisla 12 march ko sthaneey nivasee naveen jain kii yachika par sunaaya
 The Consumer Forum in its nine-page judgment stated, "in lieu of the mental trauma caused to the petitioner due to an error in service by the opposition Gana (defendant), the opposition Gana complainant received Rs
 25,000 in a period of two months of receipt of this order
 Pay it " upabhokta forum ne apane vistrut faisle main yah aadesh bhi diya he ki prativaadee gana yachikakarta ko sprite kii ek bottle ke tatkaaleen kharidi mulya ke rup main aath rupee bhi lautaaye or saath hi, yachika daayar karne main hue kharch ke evaj main yachikakarta ko 3,000 rupee chukaaye jaayen
 Naveen Jain filed a petition in the District Consumer Forum on April 29, 2009, stating that he had purchased 12 bottles of Sprite from a shop called Raj Enterprises on Dhar Road, Indore, for his child's birthday party
 yachika ke mutabik graahak ne jab ghar jaakar dekha, to inamen se ek band bottle main keedaa dikhaayi diya
 Jain had filed a petition in this regard against Hindustan coca-cola Beverages' plant at Pilukhedi in Rajgarh district of Madhya Pradesh, the company's office in Indore and two local firms - Raj Enterprises and Mittal Agency in the District Consumer Forum
 yachika par sunwaayee ke dauraan hindustan coca cola bevarijes ne apane khilaaf lagaaye gayi aaropon ko khaarij karte hue kaha tha, "company ucch gunvattta ke sheethal peya taiyaar karti he or ise botalon main bharne kii prakriya ko automatic computariced mashiinon ke jariye jaanch-parakh kar kiya jaataa he

 This time neither Amitabh Bachchan nor Sanjay Dutt's power in the most challenging election in the state's electoral history
 amar singh ke jamaane main soobe kii badahaal sadakon par sitaron kaa kaitwa karaane vaali sapa hi jab khamosh he, to baaki dalon main bhi bollywood ko lekar khaas utsaah nahin he
 In such a situation, only a few names of politics, sports and film world are left which can be misguided to be called a star
 congress ke raaj babbar, mohammad ajaharuddin, rahul gandhi or bhaajapa ke varun gandhi hi kisi tarah is jamaat main feet baith rahe hai
 But despite the election coming to a head, these giants have not been able to spread electoral board in their area so far
 ajaharuddin ne 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress ke tikat par muradabad main apana paracham laharaya tha
 The charisma of the stylish batsman who made a special place in the hearts of crores of fans in the '90s with magical wrists, standing collars and black amulets landed in his Lok Sabha constituency in just two years
 ab tak logon ko loksabhaa kshetra se ajahar kii duuri akharati thi, lekin vidhansabha chunaav ke najadik aane ke baad bhi unki gaiyrhaaziri gambhir marz banati ja rahi he
 In fact, after the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress had to face a crushing defeat at the hands of the BSP in the by-election in Moradabad West Assembly seat
 iske baad se hi muradabad se congressi saansad kii dooriyaan banane lagi thim
 a senior Congress leader who led Azhar's campaign during the Lok Sabha elections says that the manner in which the local MP was ignored in ticket distribution, he has no effect on the candidates
 pratyaashiyon ke saath ajahar kii ek mulaakaat tak nahin hui
 At present, Azhar's star face is not able to inspire the Congress workers in the area much and the party's election campaign seems to be scattered
 muradabad jile kii sabhi chah siton par jahaan sapa or basapa ne apane ummidavaaron kaa elaan kar diya he, vahiin congress kaaphi peeche chhot chuki he
 In the list of Congress candidates, Dr
 Kant from Dr
 mohammadulla, kundaraki se shaukat ali ko utaara gaya he
 On the question of ticket distribution, District Congress President Devraj Sharma definitely says, "the party will have to avoid the tendency to embrace the people who circumambulate Ganesh by bypassing the organization
 ''udhar, rahul gandhi kaa paaramparik loksabhaa kshetra amethi yani chhatrapati shahuji maharaj nagar bhi yuvaraj ke didaar ko taras rahaa he
 In 2009, Amethi, Rahul's parliamentary constituency got a new name when the Mayawati government created a new district by cutting some areas of Sultanpur and Rae Bareli
 nayaa jila banane ke baad amethi kii janata pehali baar vidhansabha chunaav ke siyaasi utsav main shaamil hone ja rahi he
 In such a situation, the concerns of the voters coming under the ambit of assembly seats of Amethi parliamentary constituency, which is considered to be the stronghold of Congress, has also been included
 chhatrapati shahuji maharaj nagar (amethi) main kul paanch vidhansabha kshetra hai
 Of these, Tiloi belongs to Salon Rae Bareli district, while Jagdishpur, Gauriganj and Amethi assembly constituencies have been separated from Sultanpur district and included in Amethi district
 salon vidhansabha kshetra par congress kaa kabja he
 Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj, a resident of Salon, does not want to go to the city
 aise main yah bada mudda banakar ubhara he
 In the beginning of last year, Rahul Gandhi also strongly opposed the inclusion of Salon in the new district, by tapping the pulse of the public
 is ilaake main congress kii sthiti abhi bhi apni vipakshi partiyon se behatar he lekin sapa se sidhaa muqabla he
 Amethi and Jagdishpur assembly seats were won by the Congress in the last election but this time some new issues have emerged here
 rojgaar sabase bada mudda he
 The people of the area are upset due to the constantly closing industries business and no new employment opportunities
 vipakshi partiyaan jor-shor se is baat ko hawa dekar apane paksh main rasta taiyaar kar rahi hai
 The situation is not good in Rahul's cousin and BJP MP Varun Gandhi's Pilibhit
 pilibhit vikaas se koson dur he, uttar pradesh main sabase zyada mandi shulk jamaa karne vaala yah jila apane vikaas ko taras rahaa he
 There is neither good education in the area nor any engineering college, nor has there been any industrial development so that people here can live and live in the area
 aaj bhi rojgaar or shiksha ke liye unhen baahar nikalnaa padataa he
 There is a lakh population of people from outside here in Puranpur, with the largest number of Bengalis, they have only huts to live

 It is difficult for Raj Babbar to become MP from Firozabad after defeating Dimple Yadav, daughter-in-law of SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav
 sansadeey kshetra kii paanchon siten jeetna unke liye saakh kaa sawaal ban gaya he
 In view of the prevailing situation in this region, it is not easy to open the account of Congress in this stronghold of BSP and SP
 firozabad ke sthaneey congressi netaa shahid patel kaa yah kahana uchit hi laga ki loksabhaa chunaav main raaj babbar kii jeet unki nijee jeet thi
 The voters here, not the Congress, voted in view of the work done by Raj Babbar in Agra
 party alaakaman ne bhi tikat vitaran main unhen khulaa haath diya
 The Congress has announced candidates for three out of five seats in Firozabad district and 4 out of 9 seats in Agra - the declared candidates are confident that with the help of Rajbhai, they will cross their eyes
 lekin vartmaan sthiti ko dekhte hue lagata nahin ki congress firozabad main loksabhaa chunaav jaisi kamyaabi hasil kar paaegi
 In Rahul's parliamentary constituency, his sister Priyanka Gandhi will soon start campaigning on behalf of Congress candidates
 isse congress ke yuvaraj kaa kaam aasaan ho jayega
 But the assembly elections are going to be a tough challenge for the remaining three leaders
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad se in netaaon ke liye sahi myne main pariksha kii ghadi ab ai he
 Azhar may have to suffer the brunt of the party's defeat in the area as Varun and Babbar have shown their strength in politics

 The case of gang rape of two sadhvis in Pendra area of bilaspur district of Chhattisgarh turned out to be fake
 haptebhar pehle do sadhviyon ne mukhyamantri raman singh ko gangrape se peedit bataakar nyaay kii maang kii thi
 Chief Minister Raman Singh had given instructions to the police to register a case of gang rape after hearing the plea of both the sadhvis
 ghatana ke kareeb saadhe teen maheene baad police ne aath aropiyon ke khilaaf gangrape kaa maamla darj kar unki dhar pakad shuru kii
 When the accused, who were caught by the police, revealed the reality, the ground slipped under the police's feet
 police ne aropiyon or gangrape peedit dononsadhviyonka aamanaa saamana karaayaa
 During this time it was revealed that both the Sadhvis, on the advice of their Guru, instructed them to register a case of gang rape by conspiring against their adversaries
 puraa maamla uttarapradesh ke basti jile sthit baba sachchidanand ke santakuti ashram ke malikana haq ko lekar chal rahe vivaad se judaa he
 Both Sadhvis have accepted the point of writing a false report
 iske baad police ne unka CRPC act kii dhara 164 ke tahat bayaan darj kiya
 Now the police is preparing to file a false report against both the Sadhvis and register a case under the sections of criminal conspiracy
 darasal, baba sachchidanand ke khilaaf aaropee dilchand kii beti ne balaatkaar kaa mukadmaa darj karaayaa tha
 This case was registered in Basti district of Uttar Pradesh

 He said that following the instructions of his guru, both the Sadhvis concocted the story of taking betel nuts and gang-rape
 iske baad jaanjgir champa jile kii sarhad par sthit son nadi ke sunsaan ilaake main pahunchi, phir vahaan se sthaneey logon kii sahaayta lekar pendra thane main gangrape kii report darj karai
 SP Arif Sheikh said that the police investigated the gang rape incident for more than three months, but nothing could be established from the statements of the victims, the evidence of the incident, the victim and the movement of the accused
 iske chalate police ne gangrape kaa prakaran darj nahin kiya tha
 After the instructions received later, the police registered the case and decided to get to the bottom of the case, according to them, Baba Sachchidananda had filed a false case against the victim's father to counter the rape incident registered against him
 unhone bataaya ki sadhviyon ne do lakh kii supaari dekar unki hatya karaae jane ke aarope lagaae the
 When this fact was investigated, it was found that the financial condition of the accused, Ruchi, is so bad that he was able to give a contract of two lakhs for the killing of both the sadhvis
 unhone aage bataaya ki peedita or aropiyon se hui poochtacha ke baad donon hi sadhviyon ne 164 ke bayaan main juthi report likhaanaa sweekaar kar liya he
 On June 15, 2018, at Pandra police station in Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, there was a stir after the incident of gangrape with two sadhvis
 peedit sadhviyon ke mutabik 25 march 2018 kii der shaam unke saath aath logon ne baari-baari se balaatkaar kiya
 One of the rapists, Ruchinda, had also offered to give a supari of Rs two lakh to the other person present on the spot for killing both the sadhvis
 sadhviyon ne police ko yah bhi bataaya tha ki is shaks ne rupee lekar unhen maut ke ghat nahin utaara, balki chhattisgarh or uttarapradesh chhod desh ke kisi bhi hisse main jane kii hidaayat di thi
 On the report of the Sadhvis, the police registered a crime under sections 366, 367 against Janjgir resident Ruchiand Patel, UP resident Kalpnath Chaudhary, Girjashankar Chaudhary, Shyamanand Chaudhary alias Tapasyanand and four other accused

 But in the Sunday attack, the miscreants opened fire till the last time and when they confirmed their death, they fled
 haalanki bharat singh par bhi darjanabhar aapraadhik maamle darj the lekin wo hansmukh or milansaar netaa ke rup main jane jate the
 It is different that his political building was also based on the fear of Kishan wrestler but Bharat Singh wanted to get out of the infamous mafia image and earn money in real estate business with Netagiri
 lekin shaayad unhone ye nahin sochaa ki jis jameen ke tukade kii dushmani ne do darjan se zyada hatyaein karwaai wo unhen kaise bakhs detii, lihaaja 29 march kii der shaam wo bhi usee gangvaar kii bhet chadh gaye jisaki buniyaad par unka raajnneetik safar shuru hua tha

 lekin in hatyaon ne kishan pahalwaan ko jaraayam kii duniya kaa betaj badshaah bana diya jisaki bina par karodon rupye kii praparty or vasuuli kaa raaj kaayam ho gaya tha
 After the killing of Balraj in 1998 and Anoop in 2004, the Kishan wrestler decided to break his ties with the world of crime
 unhone apane chote bhai bharat singh ko raajnneeti main laane kii sochi
 In 2004, Bharat Singh became a councilor, after this, for the first time in 2008, Najafgarh contested an independent election and won a landslide victory by nearly 11 thousand votes
 haalanki vaise to kishan pahalwaan kii omprakash chautaala se najdiki kisi se chhipi nahin thi

 yahi vajah he ki is bazaar kaa naam bhi 'mahila bazaar' he
 This market, located on Tagore Road behind Delhi's civic center, is known as Mahila Bazaar

 Sanjay Kumar Singh, director of this organization, said that in view of the problem of these women, this market was opened in 2007
 bazaar khulne ke saath himahilaon ko rojgaar mil gayaor unki pareshaani dur ho gai
 In this market, women sell utensils found in colonies around their homes by selling utensils
 ye mahilaayein bazaar se do se dhai hajaar rupaye tak kama leti hai
 Earlier these women used to go to the Red Bazaar's Sunday market and sell their goods
 yahaan saamaan bechney ke dauraan in auraton ko kai tarah kii pareshaani uthaani padati thi
 Along with security, there were many problems related to the place
 lekin ab unhen aisi pareshaaniyaan nahin uthaani padati hai
 The women who shop here belong to poor families
 is bazaar menkapade se lekar juute tak sab kuch miltaa he
 If you come to shop here, then everything is found here
 daam bhi thik he or saamaan bhi acha mil jaataa he
 There is a need to establish more such markets
 isse mahilaayein to aarthik rup se aatmanirbhar hongi hi saath logon ko bhi sahuuliyat hogi

 On Saturday, there was an alliance between the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party in Uttar Pradesh, but the Congress was not included in this alliance
 aise main ab sabaki najar is par he ki kabhi mahagathbandhan banane kii koshish karne vaali congress kii agali ranneeti kya hogi
 Just before the general elections, the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party formed a coalition keeping the Congress out, so everyone's eye is on the next strategy of the Congress
 mana ja rahaa he ki vah uttar pradesh main akele hi chunavi samar main utarane kaa faisla kar sakati he
 a senior Congress leader told India Today that we are going to contest alone on all the seats
 rahul gandhi kii raily kii yojana banaai ja chuki he, or bahut sambhaavna he ki unki pehali raily lakhanu main ho
 According to sources close to 'congress strong in Congress', Congress President Rahul Gandhi had met his state officials regarding the Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh before going on a tour of Dubai
 sutara ne yah bhi bataaya ki congress adhyaksh samet unke padaadhikariyon kaa maananaa he ki party kii sthiti rajya main behad majboot he
 It can compete fiercely with its candidates in the Lok Sabha elections
 party se jude sutron ke anusaar, chunavi taiyaari ko lekar party netritv kii ore se pehle hi uttar pradesh congress samiti ko waar room banane or booth str par party ko or majboot karne kaa nirdesh diya ja chukaa he
 Senior Congress leader PL Punia, who is from Uttar Pradesh himself, said that Rahul has already said that the Congress should not be underestimated in Uttar Pradesh

 7ghz octa-core mediatek MT6752 processor-camera- 13 megapixels Saaho Movie Review: bahubali prabhas (prabhas) box offis par koharaam machaane aa gaye hai, or pichhali baar jahaan ve paaramparik andaaj main ection karte najar aae the to is baar ekadam modern andaaj main dushmano ke daant khattey kar rahe hai
 Hollywood Style Har Masala Samte stops the action breath of Saaho
 phir prabhas ection karte hue lagate bhi kamaal hai
 Overall 'saaho' is the perfect spice for action lovers, but for those who want a story, the film definitely brings disappointment, as the director has tried to create a grand action on a very simple story
 'saaho (saaho)' kii kahani do hajaar karod kii chori kii he or uske baad blike box kaa chakkar he
 Amidst the theft, and the scene of violence, everyone remembers undercover police officer Prabhas
 prabhas kii entry ke saath hi ection kaa tufaan aa jaataa he
 But as soon as Shraddha Kapoor's entry in 'saaho', the speed is controlled
 ection kii is dose ke bich romance kaa chhaunk atakane lagata he
 Prabhas says that 'violence has become too much' and talks of romance
 lekin 'saaho' main yah romance hi sirdard banataa he
 a lot of villains and needless twists seem to be disturbed in the film's story
 film main puri tarah se tari rahata he to sirf prabhas kaa ection
 Overall Sujit has tried to make a weak story 'bahubali'
 'saaho (saaho)' main acting kii baat karen to prabhas (prabhas) saamaanya he
 He has a slow speaking style of speaking, which accumulates in many places and also kills in many places
 lekin ection karte hue bejod lagate hai
 His stature and style is a great fit for action
 kul milakar unki parade par maujuudagi 'saaho' main jaan daal detii he
 a dialogue from Saho is very amazing, 'in street cricket, everyone is Tendulkar, the real talent is the one who can kill a Sixer outside the ground
 ' beshak ection ke maamle main ve sixsar maarane main kaamyaab rahe hai
 The second actor in the film who catches attention is Chunky Pandey
 chanki pandeya ne apni acting se dil jeeta he
 Shraddha Kapoor's character is very poorly written
 isliye shraddha kapur koi rang nahin jamaa paati hai
 The music of 'saaho' is good, but the songs in 'saaho' work to slow down the pace of the film
 diarection kii baat karen to sujith ne dikhaa diya he ki bharat main hollywood style ection rachaa ja saktaa he
 The cinematography and graphics of the film are amazing
 diarection bhi thik-thaak he, lekin kamjor kahani puraa jaayaka bigaad detii he
 There is nothing new in the story, and there have been attempts to cram things
 'saaho' kul milakar ection or graphics kaa kamaal he, jise prabhas or ection premiyon ke liye ek baar baar dekhnaa to banataa he

 dadu jile ke rahane vaale od ko shuruuaat main apipi ke islamabad main samvaadadaata ke taur par niyukt kiya gaya or phir hyderabad tathaa is saal april main karachi tabadalaa kar diya gaya
 The discriminatory trend began when one day Oud's younger son Raj Kumar arrived at his office and everyone came to know that he was a Hindu
 akhbaar ne unke hawaale se kaha, 'darasal mere naam main khan laga he isliye daftar main har kisi ko laga ki main muslim hum
 'he claimed,' the bureau chief asked me to set aside my glass of water in the office due to the objections of some colleagues
 ' As Ramadan began, Odd was not allowed to sit at a table during Iftar and senior colleagues suggested that he bring his own plate and glass if he wanted to eat at the office
 unhone kaha, 'main ab daftar main alag gilaas or ek plate laa chukaa hum
 He said APP Karachi bureau chief Pervez Aslam denied such a request
 unhone kaha, 'vah flu se peedit the, isliye hamane alag gilaas kii vyavastha karne ko kaha
 Aslam said that when he was transferred from Hyderabad, he supported Ood and called the allegations of discrimination a publicity stunt
 unhone kaha, 'aap mere karyaalay aaiye or dekhie ki vah hamaare saath iftaar main khate hai
 However, APP managing director Masood Malik said that they have started investigating the case
 tippaniyan The Pakistan Institute of Labor Education and Research (pilar), a labor rights organization, has written a letter to Federal Information Minister Parvez Rashid, against the stand of discrimination
 pillar ke kaaryakari nideshak karmat ali ne kaha, 'ham sachmuch hairaan hai ki sarkari samachar agency ke beuro chif ne ek samvaadadaata par isliye alag gilaas main pani pine ke liye dabaav banaaya kyonki vah hindu hai
