 Recently, Kapil Sharma was in the news due to a return to TV and a dispute with a film journalist after that
 lekin pichley kuch dinon se wo kahaan gaayab hai, unka sho 'family time vid kapil sharma' kaa kya hua, isaki thik-thik khabar kisi ko nahin he
 In fact, when family time closed, it was said that Kapil, unhappy with the content, would bring the show to the new club after a month's break
 ek maheene kii samay-seemaa beete kaaphi vakt ho chukaa he, lekin 'family time vid kapil sharma' ko lekar na to kapil kii team or na hi channel kii ore se koi future plan bataaya gaya he
 Is Kapil's show finished like last time? It is believed that the family time is over like Kapil's old show
 haalanki soni tivi ke saath unke rishte ab bhi behatar hi hai
 The sign of the closure of family time was also found in Sony tv's business head Danish Khan in a recent interview
 darasal, indian express ke ek sawaal ke jawaab main danish ne family time kii vaapasi par to kuch nahin bolaa par bhavishya main kapil ke saath dobaaraa channel ke kaam karne kii baat kahi
 Danish said- "whenever Kapil is healthy, we will work with him again
" hamen unke saath kaam karne main bahut khushi hogi
 "
 
 
 to inke naa hone kii vajah se flop hua kapil sharma kaa nayaa sho!da kapil sharma sho bhi aise hi hua tha bandabata den ki 'family time' ke dauraan bhi puraane sho kii tarah hi kapil ke lagaataar shoot cancel karne kaa aarope laga
 However, those close to Kapil rejected these things outright
 baad main unke kharaab swasthya kaa hawala bhi diya gaya
 Earlier, the same thing happened during 'the Kapil Sharma Show'
 kaha gaya ki kapil set par celebs ko ghanton intjaar karavaate the or unhen bina shooting ke hi waapas lautaa dete the
 Talk of his illness also came to light
 iske baad channel ne brake dene ke naam par kapil kaa sho hi band kar diya tha
 Kapil Sharma's legal notice to the journalist, apologizing in 7 days, he is struggling with depression
 If Kapil Khabar believes, Kapil is suffering from depression and getting treatment for it
 saath hi reports kii maane to kaam se brake milane par wo apni garlfriend ginni chatarath ke saath holiday par bhi gaye the
 The news of Kapil's depression has been coming for the last one year
 unhen sharaab kii bhi lat thi
 His illness and addiction are said to be the cause of the downfall
 kapil sharma bole- dekhte rah jaaenge log, karuunga dhamaakedaar vaapasieditor ko di gaaliyaan:april main kapil ne ek antertenment portal ke editor ko phone kar gaaliyaan di thim
 Kapil's fans were surprised after the editor made the phone recording public
 itnaa hi nahin kapil ne editor, priti simos or unki bahan niti simos ke khilaaf FIR darj karvaa diya tha
 Kapil accused these people of recovering Rs 25 lakh and defaming them
 pichley saal march kapil ke peeche-peeche he vivadakpil pichley ek saal se vivaad main bane hue hai
 In March last year, Kapil had a fight with Sunil Grover in flight
 iske baad sunil ne 'da kapil sharma sho' ko chhod diya tha
 Ali Asgar, Chandan Prabhakar along with Sunil had also said goodbye to the show
 haalanki iske baad bhi kapil ne apana sho jari rakhaa tha, lekin phir unhone celebs ke saath shooting cancil karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 Many celebs kept waiting for hours on their sets, but Kapil did not come for the shoot
 lagaataar cancil karte the shoot:us samay kapil ke depressant main hone kii khabaren aati thi
 However, there was another reason behind all this, not just the disease
 darasal, kapil un dinon apni duusari bollywood film 'firangi' kii shooting main biji the
 There were reports that Kapil used to shoot the film by canceling the shooting of his show
 kuch reports yah bhi kahati thim ki kapil itani sharaab pi lete hai ki shooting ke liye samay par uth hi nahin pate the
 Hearing all these things people started saying that Kapil could not handle stardom
 vivaad badhata dekh channel ne ye sho band karne kaa faisla liya tha
 The channel wanted Kapil to return to health
 dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki kapil tamaam chizon se kis tarah baahar nikalakar tivi par vaapasi karenge

 sarkaar ne petrol or dijal ke daamon main rojaanaa badlaav ke nae niyam ko shuukravaar subah chah baje se lagu kar diya
 Now the prices of petrol and diesel will change not at 12 o'clock at night but at 6 o'clock in the morning
 nae niyam se petrol pump maalik behad kush hai
 He believes that this decision of the government is very good
 isse petrol pump maalikon ke saath hi aam logon ko bhi faaydaa hoga
 However, very few people know about how to keep updated with their changed daily prices
 When people were asked about the new rule at Mayur Vihar Petrol Pump in Delhi, they said that we are not aware of this
 jab unase yah poocha gaya ki ve rojaanaa petrol or dijal ke daamon main badlaav kii jaankaree se kaise apdet rahenge, to unhone koi santoshjanak jawaab nahin diya
 They said that they themselves do not know how they will keep updated with this
 aise main ab sawaal uth rahe hai ki agar rashtriya rajdhani dilli main yah haal he, to doordaraj ke gaanvon main kya hoga? dilli main logon ko is baat kii jaankaree nahin he ki aaj se petrol or deazal ke daam rozaana badalenge
 However, this new rule has been applied to 58 thousand petrol pumps of the country
 ise bhi padhieh petrol-dijal kii keemton main hui katautee, aaj se roj tay honge daamamgar qareeb 6-7 hazaar hi petrol pump aise he, jisamen automatic apdet system laga he yani jaise hi nae daam lagu honge, inpetrol pump main apane aap apadetaho jayega
 But what will happen to those petrol pumps where the machine itself has to change the price
 aise main yah ashanka jataai ja rahi he ki petrol or dijal ke daam kam hone ke baavjood inako bade hue daamon ke aadhaar par mahangaa bechaa jayega
 How to know today's price? The biggest problem facing the general public is how to find out the changed prices of daily petrol and diesel
 ise jaanane ke liye yaa to aap indian ol kii web site par dekh sakate he yaa phir ek messej ke zarie pataa kar sakate he
 For this, you have to type SMS RSP DEALER CODE and send it to 92248
 is messej ke baad aapako jawaab aayega kii aaj petrol deazal kii qeemat kya he? Ranjan was shot dead on May 13 last year and his wife has alleged Shahabuddin's role in the murder

 modi sarkaar kaa shapath grahan ho gaya
 On the occasion of Teacher's Day in 2014, he had said in response to a student's question that by 2024, he will be the Prime Minister
 bahut kam log hote hai jo satta ke bare main is tarah kaa raajnneetik daawa puraa kar dete hon
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's second term formally began
 krishi pradhan bharat desh main aaj kaa din event pradhan rahaa
 Say that the ministers started getting calls, otherwise the circles of anchors were drying up, whose name should be played and whose name was not
 magar sabakaa dhyaan is baat par tha ki is mantrimandal kii sabase badi khabar kii ghoshnaa kab hogi
 There was speculation but no one was able to run when the announcement of Amit Shah's joining would be made
 tabhi paune paanch ke aas paas gujarat se ek twit aata he
 Gujarat BJP President Jitu Baghani tweets that we have greeted and congratulated our pioneering guide Shri Amit Shah ji on joining the Union Cabinet under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji as a strong partner
 bas khabar brake ho gai
 BJP national president Amit Shah will be part of the Modi government
 jin logon ne pradhanmantri modi or amit shah ke bich pratispardhaa ko dekha wo donon kii saath shuru hui yatra ko nahin dekh paae
 Many times, the leaders whom we see on TV day and night, it seems that we know everything about them
 magar ek baar phir se amit shah ke bare main jaanane kii zarurat he
 14 years younger than the Prime Minister
 is vakt 54 saal umr he
 If you want to understand the relationship between Amit Shah and the Prime Minister, then i want to show some pictures
 raajnneeti rishton kaa yah vizual order he
 Whenever you see Amit Shah welcoming the Prime Minister, a variety of formality will be seen and it will be seen every time
 pradhanmantri car se utarate hai or amit shah chupchaap ek saamaanya kaaryakarta kii tarah ang vastra pahanaakar guladasta dete hai
 You will never see manipulation of it
 jab bhi dekhenge ek hi kism kii aupchaarikta nazar aegi
 Amit Shah and Narendra Modi have known each other since 1987
 unke rishte main kitni anaupchaarikta hoti hogi, lekin baahar yani camere ke saamne is tarah kii tasviir ko dekhakar aap samaj sakate hai ki donon main bos koun he
 Who is the leader maine yah tasviir aapako isliye dikhaai kyonki pichley paanch saal main maine hameshaa yah notice kiya he ki amit shah narendra modi kaa swaagat aupchaarik tareeke se hi karte hai
 This visualization is only a few seconds and always disappears in the coverage of the big events after this reception but i have always seen who is the leader of these two in the eyes of the world
 is mulaakaat kii ek khaas baat yah bhi he
 The Prime Minister also meets as if you did not know Amit Shah
 amit shah bhi aise swaagat karte hai jaise pradhanmantri se darate hon
 Students of politics and media note this separately to what extent in public life one has to be formal and disciplined
 isiilie shuruuaat main maine ise vizual order kaha yani drishy vyavastha
 Whatever the two are for each other, they will always look the same in front of the camera
 amit shah or narendra modi kii khaas baat yah bhi he ki donon ek duusare kaa rasta cross nahin karte hai
 Do you remember that Amit Shah has gone to America, visited London and is giving speeches there
 pichley 5 saal main kya aap ek bhi aisi ghatana bataa sakate hai
 Amit Shah knows what his limits are
 unhen jaanane vaale kehete hai ki ve mugaalata nahin paalate hai
 He remembers that he is Amit Shah
 narendra modi unke netaa hai
 Amit Shah and Narendra Modi have known each other since 1987

 Rajkopar too
 aag lag jane ke kaaran puraane jaisaa to nahin rahaa, magar is restraan kii inaki zindagi main ek choti si jagah he
 Amidst the tea and jalebi here, Amit Shah had one day told Narendra Modi that you are the future of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 ek din aap bharat ke pradhanmantri banenge
 At that time Narendra Modi did not even become the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 baatcheet vaali ye jaankaree maine shila bhatta ke lekh se lee he
 Both of them had since started to understand the world outside Gujarat
 jab tak adwani 2009 main naakaam nahin hue donon ne apane netaa kaa rasta nahin kaata
 It is only after his failure that the Modi Shah duo begins to emerge in BJP politics

 amit shah ahmedabad se bas pakad kar rajkot gaye the jepi ko dekhne
 Memories also have their limits

 You can read Sheila Bhatt's article published on 25 January 2016 in Indian Express
 shila bhatta ne us lekh main likhaa tha ki amit shah ko bijepi kaa adhyaksh isliye banaaya gaya kyonki ve hindutv or rashtrawaad ko lekar sankoch nahin karte
 Do not retreat

 In prison, he vowed to defeat the Congress

 In the article by Sheila Bhatt, he has said that whenever this will be written about him, this case will be written
 soharabuddin tulsiram prajapati cese unki chhavi kaa hissaa he jisaki parvaah nahin karte
 They keep doing their work
 2007 kaa saal tha
 i was the brand new reporter
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey aa rahe the
 i was posted at Amit Shah's house
 2014 ke baad se meri amit shah se koi mulaakaat nahin
 This time when the results were coming in 2019 when the BJP made a roster of 48 spokespersons to send in channels, not a single spokesperson was named for my program but i was in Amit Shah's house in the year of 2007
 bilkul bheetar
 With the same red mike
 amit shah jab apni maa kaa aashirwad lekar matganana centre ja rahe hai, unke paanv chhu rahe hai tab main amit shah ke ghar ke bheetar tha
 i want to show you
 rigelt se pehle amit shah ne kaha tha ki bijepi ko do tihaai siten aaengi or riselt bhi aisa hi hua tha
 Neither i changed nor Amit Shah
 amit shah ke is jawaab se aap unki raajnneeti kii style ko samaj sakate hai
 Probably no place for atonement
 lekin amit shah ko maine dilli ke vidhansabha chunaavon main 100-50 kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte dekha tha
 i felt that the national president would return after seeing such a small crowd, but Amit Shah had completed his program in the South Delhi area
 amit shah somnath mandir trust ke adhyaksh hai
 He has also been the President of Gujarat Cricket Association
 ek rajaneta kii jivan yatra dilachasp hoti he
 No one knows when that book becomes a book and when the book's footnotes
 jo netaa hota he vah footnots main bhi rahata he or kitaab bhi ban jaataa he
 Amit Shah has also changed BJP
 darjanon zilon main bijepi kaa nayaa daftar banaaya gaya
 Amit Shah planned them and before the end of his term, a new office of BJP was ready in many districts of the country
 duusari party ke netaaon ke bare main hamane suna he ki party kaa paisa lekar duusare dal main bhaag gaye magar amit shah ke nirdesan main bijepi ke kai nae daftar bane
 Delhi's headquarters is grand
 in daftaron se bhi ek nai raajnneetik vyavastha kaa andaaza ho janaa chahie tha
 Amit Shah asked the workers to keep a complete record of their performances, activities
 taaki aane vaali pidi ke log use dekh saken
 We can do research because nobody believes in oral history
 shila bhatta ke lekh main ye line padhakar hairaani bhi hui
 How seriously Amit Shah, who has changed the basic themes of history, takes facts and sources seriously in his party's history
 shapath grahan samaaroh kaa apana jalawaa hota he
 How much importance do media give to the ministries related to the lives of common people
 desh bhar main sookhaa he magar jal sansaadhan mantralay kise mila is par nazar kam rahati he, grih mantralay kise mila iske chakkar main hi sabhi rahete hai
 Power dominates our thinking
 us soch tak satta pahunchati he kaise isaki ek misaal he shapath grahan
 This courtyard of Rashtrapati Bhavan, filled with thousands of guests, looked as grand as a TV serial set
 udaarikaran ke daur main hamane jis bharat ko tivi siriyalon ke zarie dekhnaa shuru kiya tha vah bharat aaj raashtrapati bhawan ke praangan main set kii tarah hi to bhavy nazar aa rahaa he

 anek channelon ke zarie dur daraaj ke ilaakon main baithe log jab in hastiyon ko dekh rahe honge to vahaan tak pahunchane kaa sapana bhi dekh rahe honge
 The grandeur of power enters the common houses with divinity
 sapana banati he
 Someone Raju must have been dreaming of becoming Prime Minister
 koi sunita pradhanmantri banane kaa sapana dekh rahi hogi
 In this Modi system round of politics and media, if you do not understand the visual order, then you cannot understand the Modi era
 sab kuch camere kii nigaah se bhavy he
 This grandeur has two ends
 ek chor par pradhanmantri modi hai or duusare chor par wo tamaam vishisht log jo aaj ke din khud ko khaas samaj rahe hai magar unhen camera aam logon kii tarah dikhaa rahaa he
 Everything seems so close, but even then the distance has been calculated properly
 bharat apni niyati ko darj kar rahaa he
 He has seen many things but has seen this after a long time
 bahut kuch pehali baar dekh rahaa he
 The festival of democracy has ended
 ab ek or parv shuru ho rahaa he
 Knowing the magic of the hot air from the scorching midwife of Delhi, it would have started flowing in the evening when these common people sitting under the open sky, considered themselves lucky without complaining of high heat
 modi system kaa vizual order
 Power comes from powerful vehicles
 aati to har baar thi magar ab in gadiyon ke aane kaa andaaz badal gaya he
 The way power looks has changed
 bharat ko dekhne kaa tarika badal lijie
 This is the new India
 nayaa-nayaa dikh rahaa he
 From mangoes to special people have stood up to welcome the Prime Minister
 camere ne sabko darj kar liya he
 The swearing in comes once in five years
 ab shuru hota he shapath grahan samaaroh

 esbiai shodh report ke anusaar, 'farvari ant main 78-88 pratishat mudra phir se chalan main aa jaaegi
 It also includes better delivery of currency with more short notes
 ' ek or saarvajanik bank ke varisht adhikari ne kaha ki halaat main sudhaar ho rahaa he or nikasi par ab kuch hi saptaah kii baat he
 "I believe this will happen before the end of the current financial year, with the Reserve Bank constantly loosening restrictions
" ' Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel, however, had not given any timelines before the Standing Committee of Parliament about the normalization of the banking system

 Development and pollution go hand in hand
 samasya tab hoti he jab ham tarakkee kii chakachaundh main usase judi samasyaon ko bhul jate hai
 Just as 'development' is a new concept, environment protection is also a problem of the new age
 vikaas, pragati kaa utprerak tatv he, lekin iskaa mul mahaj aarthik tatv nahin he, balki gunatmak unnati he
 Every resident of the country, whether they are humans or animals, are willing to breathe in clean air
 par manushyon ne nadi, talab, jharne, samudr sabko nasht kiya he
 Today's environment, millions of trees, insects, moths, animals and birds, is no longer natural to anyone
 kya janabhaawanaaon main aise hi vikaas sankalpana kii gai thi? jis tarah se 'vikaas'- vaishvikaran ke baad, maanviya sashastitv kii bhaavana se pare, puunji ke prabhutv se upji nai avadharana he; thik usee tarah paryaavaran sangrakshan bhi nae jamaane kii chunauti he
 In fact, environment is a unified term, which includes everything from sun-moon, sky-earth, water-air, as well as human beings and creatures
 ye sabhi ek saath sukhad parivesh main apana nirdhaarit jivan sampann karen, yahi paryaavaran he
 It is worth mentioning that development is a relative concept and despite seeming to be equal, its meanings are different from 'progress'
 vikaas, pragati kaa utprerak tatv he, lekin iskaa mul mahaj aarthik tatv nahin he, balki gunatmak unnati he
 a positive change in everyone's life
 vidambnaa he ki bhautik sukh kii badhati laalasaa or kathith vikaas kii avadharana ne ek bhayanak samasya ko upjaaya or phir uske niraakaran ke naam par apni sari urja, sanchay shakti va dhan vyay kar rahaa he
 On the contrary, the basic basis of our folk culture and spirituality has been the feeling of co-existence

 Neither is anyone sick, nor is anyone hungry

 Pankaj Chaturvedi's book 'folk, Faith and Environment' talks about the basic spirit of our festivals and the social and environmental enlightenment arising from the changes in it, our village - also considers such tradition of ancestors living in the forests
 , Which even today the so-called literate society may call backwardness, was actually due to esoteric scientific consciousness and logical experience
 'lok, aasthaa or paryaavaran' main hamaare parv, samaaj kii manyataon main chhipe paryaavaran sangrakshan ke sutara or parvon ke bazaar banane se nasht unki mul aatma jaise masalon ko tathyon ke saath prastut kiya gaya he
 Deepawali, Holi or Chhath festival were all actually festivals to worship and save nature, which has become the medium to destroy the entire environment in the grip of marketism
 is pustak main is parv-tyoharon kii mul bhaavana or aaj unke vidrup rup se upaj rahi traasadiyon par vimarsh he
 This book seeks to prove that our joyous events, our traditions, by emphasizing the lessons of environmental protection, the traditions of nature conservation that have been in place for generations of our people and tribal society, and the imperative of animals on earth In fact, it is not the violation of the natural system, but of saving it so that this earth and its inhabitants can live a safe life for a long time
 pustakalok, aasthaa or paryaavarnalekhakarpankaj chaturvediprishth sankhyah128moolyahhard bound ru 325prakaashakapariklpana prakaashan You must have known about Tomatina Festival in Spain
 tometina festival puri duniya main mashhoor he, is festival main log ek duusare par tamaato phenkate hai
 But in India, you cannot even imagine the Tomatina Festival because here the tomato price starts changing as the seasons change
 saal main kareeb 2 baar tamaato ke bhav main jabardast tezi aati he
 One during the rainy season and the other during the winter
 aam taur par saal bhar subjiyon ke bhav thode bahut upar-neeche hote rahete hai, isaki vajah kabhi of sijan ho janaa, to kabhi deazal-petrol kii keemton ke bad janaa he
 But as the weather turns, the prices of vegetables start touching the sky
 tamaato hua or laldesh kii rajdhani dilli main tamaato ke badhate daamon ne logon kepasine chhudaa diehain
 Tomato is also being sold in the capital's biggest Azadpur mandi at Rs 60 to 80 per kg, which reaches Rs 100 to Rs 120 per kg by the time it reaches the retail market
 yah vahi tamaato he jo kareeb 25 din pehle 20 se 30 rupee kilo ke bhav se bik rahaa tha, lekin pichley 25 dinon main in tomaataron kii keemat main kareeb 500 fisadi oochaal aayaa he
 Tomato wholesaler Ashok Kaushik in Azadpur mandi said that the tomato which was selling 5 to 10 kg in the month of June reached Rs 40 per kg in the last week of June
 july kii shuruyaat se hi tamaato ke daam main tezi dekhi gai, jo ab tak barkaraar he
 Tomato in Azadpur mandi comes from Maharashtra, Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh but this time tomato is coming from Himachal Pradesh only
 baaki rajyon se tamaato mandi nahin pahunchane kii vajah tej barish aurfasalon kaa kharaab honabataya ja rahaa he
 Therefore, the prices of tomatoes have increased due to reduced tomato yield in the country
 thok vikritaon kii maane to tamaato ke daamon main abhi tezi bani rahegi
 There is absolutely no chance of tomatoes being cheap before August 15
 matlab saaf he ki mahangaa tamaato na keval aapke khaane kaa jaayaka bigadega, balki aapaki jeb par bhi baari padegaa

 Next time if you go on a date, be careful, because a study has found that the eyes can understand the difference between love and lust
 ek adhyayan ke anusaar, 'agar koi kisi ajanabi ke chehre par hi nigaah rakhata he, to isse pataa chalata he ki uske dil main ajanabi ke liye pyaar he
 If the eye of the beholder deviates on other parts of the body, then it is certain that it is subjected to lust

 In the new study, researchers conducted two tests to assess two different emotional states of romantic love and lust
 geneva uniwarsity ke chaatr or chaatraon ko do vipareet lingi yuvaaon kii tasviren dikhaai gayi, jisamen ve ek duusare se baatcheet kar rahe hai
 They are also shown pictures of opposite-sex youth, in which they are looking directly at the camera
 iske baad pratibhaagiyon se poocha gaya ki tasveeron main maujuud logon kii ankhon main pyaar jhalak rahaa he vaasana
 These data from the study yielded startling results about the eye
 kaikiyoppo ne kaha, 'waisi tasviren (jisamen do vipareet lingi ek duusare ke chehron ko dekh rahe the) ke bare main kaha gaya ki unki ankhon main pyaar he
 While such pictures (in which the eyes were slipping from the face to other parts of the body) were said to have lust in their eyes

 ' maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ne desh ke 6 shikshan sansthaanon ko utkrisht sansthaanon kaa darja diya he
 These institutions include 3 government and 3 private institutions
 in nijee sansthaanon main ek aisa naam bhi saamne aa rahaa he, jiskaa naam kaaphi prachlit nahin he or use utkrisht sansthaanon main shaamil kiya he
 The name of this institute is Jio Institute
 khaas baat ye he ki is jeeyo institute kaa naam bhi pehle nahin suna gaya or internet par bhi iskaa astitv nahin dikh rahaa he
 The government's inclusion of a 'non-existent' college or university in an excellent institution raises many questions
 reports ke anusaar jeeyo institute reliance kaa ek santhaan he, lekin abhi tak is santhaan ne kaam karnaa shuru nahin kiya he
 There is no mention of this institution on Twitter
 kendriya maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri prakaash jaavdekar ko bhi in sansthaanon kaa naam ghoshit karte hue jeeyo institute kaa koi twitor handle nahin mila or unhen bhi aise hi iskaa naam likhnaa padaa

 It is a projected institution
 website ke anusaar panel adhikari en gopal swami kaa kahana he, 'hamanen jeeyo institute ko greenfield category ke tahat chunaa he, jo ki nae sansthaanon ke liye hoti he or unka koi itihaas nahin hota he
 We saw the proposal and opted for it

 The eastern state of Jharkhand is a paradox with magical hills, huge waterfalls, valleys, rich history and diverse tribal culture
 yah rajya prakritik sansadhano jaise jangal, khanij or nadiyon ke maamle main kaaphi vividhtaon or sampada se bharpoor he, jahaan khub barish hoti he or jahaan kii mitti kaaphi upjau he
 Despite this, most of the people here live their lives in extreme poverty
 jharkhand main bharat kii kul khanij sampada kaa 40 fisadi hissaa he, lekin mulya ke maamle main dekhen to yah rajya desh ke kul khanij utpaadan main keval 10 fisadi hissedari hi rakhata he
 Another paradox is that urbanization and industrialization began here in 1907, when the Tata Company set up a steel plant in Jamshedpur and Dhanbad had developed into the coal capital of the country about a hundred years ago
 lekin in uplabdhiyon ke baavjood aaj 110 saal baad jharkhand sabase zyada gramin aabaadi vaale rajyon main se ek he
 According to the 2011 census, the urban population here is 24 per cent, which is well below the national average of 31 per cent
 teesraa virodhabhas yah he ki rajya kii shuruyaat bhale hi ek menuphaccharing or khanan centre ke rup main hui, lekin haalia aankade dikhaate hai ki yahaan sabase tej giravat menuphaccharing kshetra main hi hui he, jabaki sevaaon ke maamle main yahaan kii sthiti ascharyajanak rup se acchhee he
 The growth in the services sector has come at the expense of manufacturing, which has fallen from 34 per cent in 2004-05 to only 20 per cent in 2013-14
 is dauraan seva kshetra kii hissedari main 12 fisadi kaa ijapha hua, jabaki menuphaccharing kshetra kii hissedari 14 fisadi kam hui
 The fourth paradox is that Jharkhand is the coal capital of the country
 yah rajya mica, mangneej or boxite samet louh ayask kaa khanan centre he
 It has two of the largest steel plants in India — the Tata private plant set up in Jamshedpur and the government steel plant set up in Bokaro in 1964
 iske baavjood adhiktar maanav vikaas suchakaankon ke maamle main yah rajya 29 rajyon ke bich kaaphi nichle paaydaan par aata he
 Why are there such contradictions in Jharkhand? Is there any way out of the low-level equilibrium that this state is stuck in? The answer to this puzzle can be found in India Today's state-direction intelligence report
 rajya kii dasha-disha (esoties) reportindia today kaa salanaa rajyon kii dasha-disha survey yah maanata he ki bharat kaa bhavishya uske 29 rajyon main basataa he
 That is why its report after 2003 has become a yardstick for evaluating the performance of states
 rajya kii dasha-disha (esoties) isaki taarkik parinti he, jisamen hamane prayek rajya kaa eks-re kiya he, uskaa esdabluoti vishleshan kiya he or jilon ke str parasookshm vishleshan bhi
 Now comes directly to Jharkhand: 24 districts, 16 years, 9 categories of human development, each of which has some important scale
 esoties report jharkhand main hue aitihaasik badlaav or aarthik, saamaajik or maanviya vikaas kaa ek samgr jayja leti he
 This report evaluates the state in key categories based on comparative and reliable data available over a given time period (this type of data is available for 18 out of 24 states)
 jharkhand kii esoties report nishkarsh ke taur par ek vyapak tasviir pesh karti he, rajya ke bhavishya kaa ek rodmap khinchati he or sheersh praathamiktaaon kii pahchaan karte hue ek model ko saamne rakhti he, jo rajya kii arthvyavastha kaa puri tarah kayakalp kar sake or isaki takat ko pahachaanate hue ek acha shashan muhaiyaa kara sake
 These findings are shocking
 yah kahani aashcharyon se bhari hui he, jisamen apratyaashit parinaam shaamil hai, jo saamaanya samajhadaari ko chunauti dete hai
 At one level, the story of this state is fraught with many contradictions: the rich in view but in reality poor, in their early stages of industrialization but extremely backward in terms of urbanization
 ek duusare str par yah kahani rajya ke jilon kii badalati kismat ko bhi bayaan karti he, jahaan vibhinn prashasnic ikaayiyon ke bich jabardast pratispardhaa he or jahaan viksit ilaakon ke mukaable pichde kshetron main sudhaar kii dar tej najar aati he
 All in all, we can say that it is a story of dramatic rise and fall of the most basic administrative unit i
e
 districts
 vibhinn shreniyon main jilon kii ranking se itar yah adhyayan kuch ahm sawaalon ke jawaab bhi detaa haih vikaas ke mukhya sanchaalak kya hai? aarthik or saamaajik badlaav kaise hote hai? kya cheez logon ko shashakt karti he? rajya kaa kayakalp kaise hota he? aarthik tarakkee kii raah main mukchay avrodh koun-koun se hai? un virodhabhaason kii vajah kya he, jinamein jharkhand khud ko fansaa hua paata he? is nimna stareey santulan ke gatirodh se baahar nikalne kaa aakhir rasta kya he? ant main vyapak or mahatvuparn masalaa yah he ki yadi jharkhand ko aarthik kayakalp ke apane lakshya ko hasil karnaa he to uski sheersh paanch praathamiktaayen kya honi chahie?saamaanya samajhadaari yah kahati he ki udyogikaran, vanijikaran or shaharikaran kaa str jitna zyada hoga, maanav vikaas kaa str bhi utana hi ooncha hoga
 In this context, those states, whose industrialization, commercialization and urbanization levels will be higher
 kisi bhi rajya kii tarah is paramparaagat li par jharkhand kaa aarthik vikaas kuch had tak khara utarataa he, lekin ham jab beete 16 saalon ke dauraan hue badlaav kii dar ko dekhte hai to kai ascharyajanak tathy hamaare saamne khulne lagate hai
 For example, relatively backward districts have grown at a faster rate than developed districts
 lihaaja, tata dwaara sthapit steel city jamshedpur main mukhyalay vaala purvi singhbhum jila kuch shreniyon main bhale hi sheersh sthaan par ho, lekin pakur yaa devgarh jaise apekshaakrit pichde jilon main badlaav kii dar (pichley kuch varshon main sudhaar kii gati) jamshedpur ke mukaable tej pai ja sakati he
 Therefore, maintaining and imitating Jamshedpur where it is, is as important as developing Pakur and Deoghar
 yah rujhaan vaishvik pratispardhaa main viksit pashchimi deshon se hode leti ubhartee hui arthvyavasthaaon ke samanaantar jaan padataa he
 This means that by encouraging the backward, growth accelerates and brings more parity
 yah report paanch khandon main banty hui he
 In the introduction, we mentioned the main problems of Jharkhand i
e
 four contradictions

 Despite this, both these states are far ahead of Jharkhand in terms of GDP and Human Development Indices (see graphics)

 How is Jharkhand backward? Why did Jharkhand lag behind the other two states? Most observers cite three reasons: political instability, heavy corruption of leaders, and the short-sighted policy of freight emulation (a special policy of the Government of India to promote economic growth all over India), which has led to industrialization in Jharkhand for decades
 The deadlock was maintained (in erstwhile Bihar)
 asal khel rajnatik asthirataa kaa he, jo jharkhand ke janm se hi vahaan abhishaap kii tarah lagi rahi
 Of the 13 governments that came during 16 years after his birth, this state had a total of six chief ministers, while Chhattisgarh had only two chief ministers and seven in Uttarakhand
 jharkhand ke mukhyamantri raghubar das ne mana ki rajya ke aarthik or saamaajik pichhadepan ke peeche asal vajah yahaan kii rajnatik asthirataa rahi he
 "the main reason for Jharkhand's economic backwardness is political instability," Das told India Today

 Luckily, both Delhi and Ranchi have majority governments of the same party (BJP)
 iske chalate bhavishya main jharkhand kii aarthik tarakkee tej hogi
 "corruption here has also been tremendous in the past and there have been many scams that have rocked governments from time to time
 khanan or koyala ghotaale main yahaan ke purv mukhyamantri madhu kodaa kii giraftaar hui thi
 The region has been infamous even before it broke away from Bihar in the corruption case
 chaara ghotaalaa yaheen hua tha, jisamen argedy ke netaa lalu prasad yadav doshi paae gaye the or unhen sajaa hui thi
 One face of this corruption is the mafia culture that flourished in the mining sector, where there are many stories of deep nexus between politicians and businessmen
 kuch saal pehle rajya ke khanan mafia kii surat dikhaati ek film bhi bani he gangs of vasepur
 From 1952 to 1993, the central government adopted a short-sighted policy of freight equalization to facilitate the equal growth of industries across the country
 iskaa aashay yah tha ki desh ke kisi bhi hisse main agar koi kaarkaana lagaaya jaae to centre khanijon ko parivahan ke jariye vahaan tak le jane ke liye sabsidi degaa
 This policy severely damaged the economic development of Bihar and other mineral-rich states, as it discouraged private capital initiatives to establish production centers in these states

 "jharkhand's economy compared to the rest of the country
 Since its formation in 2000, the economic structure of Jharkhand has changed a lot
 2004-05 ke baad ke aankadon ke aadhaar par yahaan hue badlaavon ke sandarbh main nimna nishkarsh die ja sakate hai
 In 2004-05, more than half of Jharkhand i
e
 52 percent of GDP was the source of industry
 iske alaava 15 fisadi krishi se or 33 fisadi seva kshetra se aata tha
 The share of GDP within industries can be divided into three main areas: manufacturing 34 percent, mining 11 percent and construction 7 percent
 iske mukaable bharat kii kul jidipi main udyogon kii hissedari maatr 31 fisadi thi, jabaki khanan kii hissedari 4
 3 per cent and the services sector had the highest share of 41 per cent
 jharkhand ke is kshetravaar paridrishy main asal badlaav 2004-05 se lekar 2013-14 ke bich aayaa
 The share of the mining sector remained the same, but the share of services sector i
e
 insurance, telecom and hospitality came down dramatically to 45 per cent, which was very close to the national average of 47 per cent
 lekin yah hua kaise? seva kshetra main hua yah ijapha darasal menuphaccharing main ai giravat kii keemat par tha, jo 2004-05 main 34 fisadi se neeche girakar 2013-14 main 20 fisadi par aa chukaa tha
 In short, while the share of the services sector increased by 12 percent, the share of manufacturing declined by 14 percent
 duusare shabdon main kahen to jharkhand ab ek 'vishuddh' bhartiya suba banane kii disha main agrasar he, jahaan krishi, seva or menuphaccharing kshetra paraspar tulaneey sthiti main aa chuke hai
 The share of these three sectors in national GDP was 16, 16 and 47 per cent respectively in 2013-14
 jharkhand main yah anupaat 16, 19 or 45 fisadi kaa he
 If we look at the real per capita income (at the price of 2004-05) and the growth in real GDP and real GDP per capita, the comparison of Jharkhand with Bihar and the rest of the country comes as a story of contradictions
 jharkhand main prati vyakti aay samooche bharat ke ausat kaa 70

 In contrast, Bihar, which had a per capita income of only 30 per cent of the national average in 2004–05, grew very rapidly between 2004–05 to 2015–16, with a rate of 7
 5 fisadi salanaa rahi
 The per capita income in Bihar was 35 per cent of the national average as of 2014-15

 Ranking the performance of districts in Jharkhand, the Seventh Finance Commission has increased the share of resources going to the states, bringing it to 42 per cent from 32 per cent of the total tax revenue earlier

 1 karod ke kareeb aabaadi vaale jharkhand kaa aakaar peru jitna he, jo duniya kaa 40waan sabase bada desh he (kul 204 deshon ke bich)
 In such a situation, the biggest question arises that which policy makers of Jharkhand should adopt such policies to improve the performance below average in terms of growth in the last 15 years — that is, average national GDP growth per capita rate 5
 9 ke mukaable 5
 Can you come to 6? Jharkhand currently ranks 13th in terms of per capita growth rate among 21 major states including Delhi
 esoties adhyayan aise hi kuch mahatvapurn sawaalon ke jawaab detaa he or jilon kaa sookshm str par jaakar vishleshan karata he
 But the problem in this way is that the more subtle the study becomes, the more difficult the availability of data becomes
 agar aankade uplabdh bhi hon to pradarshan kaa moolyankan karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 How has this state or its districts performed on certain parameters of development? For example, let's take two indicators of development - per capita income (ie how prosperous the district is) and how 'educated' he is
 haalanki isse pehle hamen viraasat main mili masalon ko bhi dekhnaa hoga
 After all, how to take cognizance of 'initial conditions'? For example, the standard of living in Kerala has always been high, especially in terms of health and education
 aankadon ke vivaran main jane se pataa lagata he ki bhartiya rajyon ke mukaable shiksha ke maamle main kerala kii uplabdhi hameshaa zyada rahi he (kam se kam aazaadee ke baad se ab tak)
 Similarly, due to industrial development in Jamshedpur, East Singhbhum district has always been more prosperous than the rest of Jharkhand
 isliye 'aarambhik sthitiyon' ke chalate sampann hone ke kaaran purvi singhbhum ne sampannatam jile ke taur par apni sthiti barkaraar rakhi he
 However, in the context of developing countries like India, one phenomenon is 'catch up', that is, poor countries (here districts) have the potential to grow faster than rich countries (districts)
 jharkhand ke jilon ke pradarshan ko aankane ke liye isi duusare paimaane kaa istemaal kiya gaya haih yani ek nishchit samyavadhi main (is adhyayan ke liye 1999 se 2011 ke bich) sudhaar kaa aakaar yaa badlaav kii dar kya rahi?sankshep main ham tamaam suchakaankon ke bich pradarshan ke do ayaamon ko lenge—2011 main koun sa jila sarvshereshth pradarshan karne vaala rahaa or 1999 ke baad se kis jile ne sabase zyada sudhaar dikhaaya
 But there are many obstacles in the way of this analysis
 yadi saare aankade uplabdh hon, phir bhi ek samasya yah rah jaati he ki aap kai suchakaankon ke liye ek saath pradarshan kaa moolyankan kaise karenge? ek udhaaharan len: purvi singhbhum ne 2011-12 tak mahilaon kii shiksha ke maamle main sabase zyada uplabdhi hasil kii (eneses ke aankade ke mutabik), lekin jahaan tak purushon kii shiksha kaa sawaal he to is maamle main sabase zyada uplabdhi ranchi kii rahi
 In such a situation, which district should be placed at the top in terms of education? In terms of all such questions, such as per capita income, level of settled poverty, male and female education, etc
, overall performance will be assessed through ranking in categories that are not mutually comparable
 prayek suchakank ke liye sarvshereshth se lekar badtar tak ranking kii vyavastha he, jinamein sarvshereshth 1 he or sabase bure kii ranking 18 he (kyonki hamaare paas 24 jilon main se 18 ke hi aankade uplabdh hai, 1999 kaa eneses yaa 2000-01 kii janaganana or 2011-12 ke aankade)
 Therefore the best rank in case of any index would be 1
 maan lijie ki upyukt sabhi chaar athulaneey shreniyon main purvi singhbhum sabase awwal rahaa
 It has four categories - years of academic achievement, number of poor and per capita income in rupees
 to aise main rank ke lihaaj se kul mishrit score 4 hoga
 But suppose for once that East Singhbhum has a mixed score of 10, can he still be ranked 1? Yes, if the mixed score of any other district is more than 10
 duusare shabdon main, ham rank kii rank hasil kar sakate hai, jise borda rank kehete hai
 The name is named after the French mathematician and political scientist Jean Charles de Borda, who invented the method in 1770
 duniya bhar main borda rank kii pranali prachlan main he or iskaa istemaal chunaavon main pratyaashiyon ke chayan aadi vyavhaarik kaamon main kiya jaataa he (hamaare yahaan rajyasabha main namakan kii pranali ko maujuuda jatil tareeke se hataakar borda rank par laayaa janaa chahie)
 The advantage of Borda rank is that in this we are able to compare some incomparable categories among themselves
 jilon kii ranking dikhaati he ki aparaadh ko kam karne or swasthya ke kshetra main sudhaar laane main shiksha kii pratyaksh or badi bhoomika hoti he
 The rate of total education in the districts has negatively affected the rate of killings
 kisi jile main shiksha kii ausat dar main ek fisadi kaa ijapha prati vyakti hatya kii dar ko 0
 Brings down 3 percent
 isi tarah yadi kisi jile main shiksha ke dar main ijapha hota he to isse balaatkaar kii dar main ascharyajanak rup se kami aati he
 a one per cent increase in the average rate of education among men in the district reduces the rape rate by one per cent

 If the Government of Jharkhand makes a serious effort to spread education across the state with emphasis on education and especially for women, it can do wonders in terms of economic and social development

 As the analysis of Jharkhand suggests, the top five priorities for the government should be — education, health, agriculture, mining and the restructuring of the manufacturing sector and encouraging the already emerging services sector to grow more rapidly

 He said that it is unconstitutional to take away the minority community's right to vote

 Then came the partition phase of 1947, he had suffered the pain of Partition, and felt it very close, in many of his stories you can feel this pain yourself

 i don't think i adopted yoga for any particular reason
 jab ham bade ho rahe the tab khel-kud or padhai ke saath-saath yoga bhi hamaare dainik jivan kaa anivaary hissaa tha
 Due to this, even after working 14 hours a day, one does not feel mentally tired
 yoga ek vyaayaam he, dhyaan he, swasth rahane kaa upaay he
 After so many years of practice, it can no longer be thought of what benefits or changes can be made
 yoga kaa anand yah he ki isamen dhire-dhire or sukun ke saath aage badha jaataa he
 Over time, you become perfect in various asanas of yoga
 mere prashikshak ne hameshaa mujhe yahi bataaya ki aap yoga ko keval ek vyaayaam ke rup main na dekhen balki ise sharir ko sudaul or dimag ko tandoorust rakhane vaale kargar upaay ke rup main dekhen

 aise main ganga river basin athurity ke sadsy rahe professor bidi treepathi kaa kahana he ki ab ganga main gangaajal bachaa hi kahaan he, jise saaf karne kii baat ho rahi he? ganga main jo bhi pani he vah naalon yaa sahaayak nadiyon kaa he
 Thousands of drains from Gomukh to Gangasagar and the chemicals of factories are being dumped directly into the Ganges
 iske baavzood ganga main itani kshamta he ki in saare vifaille padaarthon ke asar ko khatm kar de
 But the difficulty is that Ganga water is needed for this, which is no longer left in the Ganges
 ganga main ab nahin bachaa he gangajalprofessor treepathi kehete hai ki ganga ko maa kahe jane ke peeche sirf puranic hi nahin balki vaigyanik kaaran bhi hai
 In fact, the Ganges has a natural ability to clean itself, which no other river flowing through the Himalayas has
 iskaa kaaran ganga ke pravaah kaa wo maarg he jise bhageerath path kaha jaataa he
 When the Ganges comes out of Gomukh, it makes three types of eco systems
 pehla himalay se pighalane vaale glacier kaa pani jab bhageerath path se guzarataa he to pahaado kii chattaanon se minerals bhi apane saath lekar aata he
 Which are quite beneficial
 doosraa ganga kaa pani himalay par ugane vaale aushadhiy pedo kii jadon se chhan kar bhi aage badhata he jisaki vajah se iske pani main aushadhiy kshamta he
 Third, the Ganges water contains bacteriophage viruses, which kill bacteria and other harmful micro-organisms
 ganga kaa rasta badal jane va tehri baandh ke dwaara ganga kii dhara roak die jane se ganga ke ye gun pahaado tak hi simit rah gaye hai
 At the same time, pollution in the foothills of the Ganges has caused so many harmful chemicals that no one discusses
 sari yojana ganga kii satahi safai tak simit rah jaati he
 The construction of Damtihari Dam of Ganga by Tehri Dam was started during the then Narasimha Rao government
 1999 main atal sarkaar ke samay ye sawaal khadey hue ki kahin is baandh se ganga kii aadhyatmik takat ko nuksaan to nahin hoga? lihaaza atal ne varisht bijepi netaa murali manohar joshi kii adhyakshata main baandhon kii vajah se ganga par padane vaale nakaaratmak prabhaavon or tehri baandh par bukamp se padane vaale prabhaav kii jaanch ke liye ek cameti gathit kii
 Four members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad were in this committee
 ganga ke aadhyatmik mahatv par is cameti kaa kahana tha ki baandh main 10 centimetre yaa 4 inch paridhi vaali pipe laga dene se ganga kaa pravaah bana rahegaa or isaki aviralata barkaraar rahegi
 But it was ignored that due to the river's water stagnation, its natural properties — including profitable minerals, will accumulate on one side of the dam and the benefit will not reach the other side of the dam
 tehri main baandh ban jane or ganga kaa pravaah ruk jane kii vajah se hi yahaan pai jane vaali mahasir machhlee bhi vilupt hone ke kagaar par pahunch gayi
 These fish kept the Ganges water clean
 phir anshan par professor ji di agarwalaiiti kanpur se sevanivrutt professor ji di agarwal kaa kahana he ki ganga kii mukhya sahyogi nadi par lohari nagpala, bhairav ghati or paala maneri baandhon kaa nirmaan murali manohar joshi cameti ke report saunpane ke baad shuru hua
 After his fast in August 2010, the then Manmohan government had canceled these projects on the Bhagirathi River
 lekin jal sansaadhan mantri nitin gadakari ne kaha he modi sarkaar band pade in project ko phir shuru karegi
 Professor GD Agarwal is currently on hunger strike once again, angry with the central government's indifference to the Ganges

" hamane wicket nahin ganvaane kii yojana banaai thi, lekin hamane kaaphi der main aakraamakata akhriyaar kii
 He said, Chennai's wicket is always slow
 ham 10wein over tak match main bane hue the
 We wanted to increase the run pace in the 12th over, but it was delayed by one or two overs
 riddhimaan saaha ne 33 gend main naabad 46 ran kii pari khelkar chennai ko sammanjanak score tak pahunchaaya, jiske liye unhen main of da match se nawaja gaya
 Saha said, when i landed at the crease, i was just trying to rotate the strike

 Admission Process: VITEEE garibi main dubi repapeeditnaaballig ko karj bharne ke liye apni teen maheene kii dudhmunhi bacchee ko teen hajaar rupee main bechney ke liye majaboor hona padaa he
 The case is of Sitapur in UP
 peeditmaa kaa kahana he ki wo behad garib he
 There are only two utensils in the name of food utensils in the house, due to which she was unable to raise the child
 3 maheenon main hi us par doodhwaale, dawaaiyon or ilaake ke logon kaa kaaphi karj bad gaya tha
 People started asking for their money as well, due to which they had to take drastic steps like selling innocent
 maasoom ko bech dene kii khabar ko gambhirtha se lete hue esadm sadar maukey par pahunchi or unhonapeeditke parivaar waalon se baatcheet kii or sarkari suvidhaayen dilaane kaa vaada kiya
 SDM Sadar recognized that there is a lot of poverty in the family and there is nothing in the name of convenience
 yahi vajah he ki garibi or karj se pareshaan parivaar waalon ne maasoom ko 3 hazaar main bech diya he
 Significantly, the 15-year-old minor pregnant girl victim of rape in Sitapur district of Uttar Pradesh kept going round the authorities continuously for a long time, but she could not write a case against the accused boy till the end
 isi bich peedit ladki ne 9 maheene baad yani 18 disambar 2014 ko ek pyaari si bacchee ko khayrabad ke sarkari aspataal main janm diya
 On hearing the news of the child, the policemen became conscious
 police waalon ne usee din peedit se taharir lekararopeeke khilaaf dhara 376A sahit pasco act main mukadmaa darj kar diya, lekin aaropee kii giraftaar nahin kii
 In order to punish the rape accused, the victim's mother kept circling with the authorities continuously for the last 3 months, after much effort, the victim was able to arrest the accused and get jailed, but still the police officer spoke himself in front of the camera
 He was seen escaping
 sitapur se 8 kilometre dur khayrabad kasbe kaa rahane vaala ye muslim parivaar behad garib he
 There is a small slum in the name of the house
 khaanaa pakaane vaale bartanon ke naam sirf 2 hi bartan dikhaai die, jis jagah ye parivaar rahata he wo bhi kisi kii di hui jameen kaa ek chota sa tukdaa he
 This family has nothing in the name of government facility
 sarkaar kii koi bhi yojana is parivaar tak kabhi nahin pahunchi
 The year 2014 wreaked havoc on this family
 janvari 2014 main isi ghar kii ek naaballig ladki ke saath usee ke pados ke rahane vaale sabit ali ne shaadi kaa jhansa dekar rape kiya
 It is alleged that after the victim became pregnant, the accused tried to crack the case by saying marriage
 maamla thanda hone par aaropee ne shaadi se inkaar kar diya
 The matter reached the police station, but there was no help there either
 iske baad garbhvatee peedit naaballig ladki lagaataar thane se lekar police ke aalaa adhikariyon tak har roj chakkar lagaati rahi, lekin beraham adhikariyon ne uski bebasii kii taraf koi dhyaan nahin diya
 Finally 3 months ago the minor victim gave birth to an innocent child in a government hospital
 is garib muslim parivaar ne kisi tarah 3 maheene tak maasoom ko logon se karj lekar badi hi mushkilon se paala, lekin log apana diya hua paisa waapas maangane lage, jisase pareshaan peedit maa ne karj ko chukaane ke liye apane 3 maheene ke kaleje ke tukade ko ek parivaar ko mahaj 3 hajaar main bech daalaa
 The family did not get relief from this even today the burden of debt is still on the family and people are demanding the repayment of their debt
 tripura vidhansabha chunaav main left kaa kila dhwast karne ke baad rajya main ab bijepi kii sarkaar he
 BJP state president Biplab Deb was sworn in as the new chief minister of the state on Friday
 vahiin jishnu dev verma upmukhyamantri honge
 The 25-year leftist government may have been defeated hard by the BJP in the elections, but the new government will face five issues that will be challenging to deal with
 aaie jaanate hai wo paanch chunautiyaan
 
 
 1
 bhale hitripura sakshartaake maamle main aage ho, lekin yahaan berogari hataanaa sabhi sarkaron ke liye chunauti bharaa rahaa he
 Let it be known that in its election manifesto, BJP has promised employment to every youth
 aise main is vaade ko puraa karnaa badi chunauti he
 2
 prakritik sansadhano se bharpoor hone ke baavjood tripura main udyog va kaarkaanon kaa abhaav rahaa he
 During the election campaign, BJP had talked about establishing a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Tripura
 is tarah jameen adhigrahan or nae udyog sthapit karnaa bijepi ke liye chunauti hogi
 3
 berogari, udyog or shiksha ke alaava tripura main swasthya suvidha dena badi chunauti rahi he
 The BJP promised to open several multispecialist hospitals along the lines of AIIMS and improve the picture of the state's health infrastructure
 4
 Stopping infiltration and smuggling along the Bangladesh border into Tripura will be a serious issue for the government
 kyonki beete kuch varshon main ghuspaith rajya main badi he, jisase kai dfa hinsak ghatnaayen bhi hui
 To prevent this, the government will have to form stringent rules and laws with security agencies

 ' Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has once again targeted Union Minister Giriraj Singh
 unhone (nitish Kumar)buudhvaar ko kaha ki aise log jo gaiyr-jaruri tippanee karne vaale logon kaa koi dharm nahin hota he
 Note that Giriraj Singh (giriraj singh) tweeted a photo a few days ago about Nitish Kumar's Iftar party
 unhone likhaa tha ki kitna acha hota agar ye sabhi navaratri main bhi upwas rakhte
 This statement of Giriraj Singh (giriraj singh) was seen as a growing distance between BJP-JDU in the current politics of Bihar
 darasal, loksabhaa chunaav main endie ke prachand jeet ke baad modi sarkaar ne apane mantrimandal main jediu ke kisi bhi netaa ko shaamil nahin kiya tha
 Nitish Kumar has also expressed his displeasure over this matter
 gauratlab he ki giriraaj singh ke is bayaan ke baad bijepi adhyaksh or desh ke grahamantri amit shah ne kadi pratikriya di thi
 He also instructed Giriraj Singh not to give such statements again
 apane bayanon se aksar vivaadon main ghirne vaale giriraaj singh (giriraj Singh) ne apni hi gathbandhan party ke pramukh netaaon par sawaal uthaaya he
 It is known that between 2008 and 2010, he also served as a minister in Nitish Kumar's government
 nitish kumaar ke is bayaan ke baad hi amit shah ne is puure maamle main hastkshep karte hue giriraaj singh ko hidaayat di he
 Amit Shah telephoned Giriraj Singh and said that such complaints should not come from further
 bataa den ki amit shah or nitish kumaar se pehle giriraaj singh ke is bayaan kii lojpa ke netaa chiraag paswan ne bhi nindi kii thi
 He had told NDTV that Giriraj Sir (giriraj Singh) keeps tweeting like this
 mujhe lagata he ki media giriraaj singh (giriraj Singh) ke twit ko kuch zyada hi gambhirtha se le rahi he
 On giving a clean chit to Giriraj Singh in this controversy, Chirag Paswan said that many of his statements have come in continuity
 kabhi bhi tushtikaran kii raajnneeti nahin honi chahie kabhi bhi dharm yaa jati kii raajnneeti nahin karnaa chahie
 The PM himself had advised to avoid such rhetoric
 baharhaal hamaari apni ek apni vichaardhaara rahi he
 We are following the same thing
 baatcheet ke dauraan jab unase poocha gaya ki kya aap giriraaj singh se milenge? kya aap unase puuchhenge ki aapane aisa twit kyon kiya he? isapar chiraag paswan ne kaha ki jab unase mulaakaat hogi to main unase jarur puuchhuunga lekin mujhe lag rahaa he ki ham kisi ek ke bayaan ko kuch zyada hi dhyaan de rahe hai

 If this happens, it will be the second reference within five years

 jabaki duusare sanshodhan main iyu ke saath kisi bhi deal par sansad kii manzuri anivaary karne kaa prastaav he
 Prior to the British Parliament's final decision on Brexit, the First Minister of Scotland has said that she will bring a motion seeking a referendum in the Parliament of Scotland, and if the Scottish Parliament approves it, it will be refereed again within 2 years

 Whereas the Second Amendment proposes to make Parliament's approval mandatory on any deal with the EU

 He says that when the process of litigation is going on, how can it be sold
 anitha ne kaha ki vah is bangale main museum banaaengi or rajesh khanna kii bhi yahi chahat thi
 Pointing towards Rajesh Khanna's family, Anita said, 'they used to say that it will be made a family home

 Rajesh Khanna said that his daughters have no problem and this bungalow will be made a museum because they do not need it

 But at that time, he insulted me at the last moment
 ' unhone kaha, 'hamaari nyaay vyavastha kisi he? kamishnar ne kaha he ki isaki copy mujhe di jaaegi
 Rajesh Khanna's bungalow located on Carter Road in Mumbai 'vardan Ashirwad' has been sold to an industrialist from the city itself

 unki maut ke baad yah unki betiyon ko mil gaya tha or ab iskaa naam 'vardaan aashirwad' he
 Even after the death of Rajesh Khanna, Anita Advani demanded his share in this bungalow
 unhone tab kaha tha, 'meri is bangale main koi dilchaspee nahin he
 i just want it to be converted into a museum

 According to an estimate only 19 in the state of Punjab every year
 7 million ton paraali utpann hoti he jiskaa zyaadaatar hissaa aag ke hawaale kar diya jaataa he
 So far, 1378 complaints of stubble burning have been reported in Punjab

 a fine of Rs 27 lakh has also been done

 3 lakh rupees fine was imposed, though there have been fewer cases of burning the system as compared to last year, but the government's strictness on farmers has not been much effect
 pichley saal punjab ke kisaanon par paraali jalaane ke aarope main 73
 2 lakh rupees was fined
 haalanki asal main kitna jurmaana vasula gaya iske aankade uplabdh nahin hai
 In fact, the Punjab government, which came on the backfoot on the debt waiver case, does not want to be strict with farmers in any case
 rajya sarkaar kii saaf kar chuki he ki vah paraali jalaane kaa prabandhan nahin kar sakati kyonki uske khajaane main paisa nahin he
 For this, the state government had sent a plan of Rs 1109 crore to the Center for agriculture subsidy on the machines used in the management of the straw, which is hanging in the files
 is babat ab neshnal green tribunel ne centre ke krishi mantralay se jawaab talabi kii he
 The Punjab government is also advising farmers to buy machines for stubble management, but the prices of machines are so high that they are unable to buy them

 In Haryana, 437 cases of burning of straw have been registered
 In the neighboring state of Haryana, farmers are also burning stubble
 ab tak satellite kii madad se 437 paraali jalaane ke maamle darj kiye gaye hai or kul 115 exiaar darj kii gai he 
 The state government has so far recovered a fine of Rs four lakh from the farmers
 rajya sarkaar ne daawa kiya tha ki vah kisaanon ko paraali kaa vaigyanik prabandhan ke liye jaagruk bana rahi he
 With the help of satellite, the government has taken the services of Haryana State Application Center Agency and is marking the places where the farmers are burning the straw
 sari reports pradooshan niyantran board tak pahunchaai ja rahi hai taaki doshi kisaanon ke khilaaf karrwai kii ja sake
 The government has constituted special teams under the chairmanship of the District Magistrate comprising employees of Pollution Control Department, Agriculture Department and Police Department in each district to prevent pollution arising out of the straw

 After losing, now the farmers 'organization, Bharatiya Kisan Union, has appeared before the NGT and presented the farmers' favor
 kisaanon ne engiti ke saamne yah daleel rakhi he ki agar vah apni paraali kaa prabandhan kar bhi len to use kharidega koun or paraali prabandhan main jo kharchaa aayega use koun uthayega? kisaan sanghathanon ne maang kii he kifasalein uganapahale hi ghate kaa sauda he, ek acre main fasal ugane kaa kharchaa hi teen se chaar hajaar rupee ke bich he or upar se ab paraali prabandhan kaa kharchaa alag se do hajaar rupee prati acre jod diya jaae to khet kii sari kamai paraali hi kha jaaegi
 After listening to the farmers' organizations, the NGT has summoned the Union Ministry of Agriculture and NTPC to see if it can use the stubble of the farmers
 philhal maamla engiti ke vichaaradhin he or agle pandrah dinon main kisaan fasal kaat kar farig ho jaaenge kyoki ab tak zyaadaatar fasal kaati ja chuki he
