 philhal is baat par koi sahmati nahin he ki smartphone cancer kaa kaaran banate hai yaa nahin
 The WHO says that there is no conclusive evidence and the US and European regulators are of the same opinion
 haalanki researchrs kaa maananaa he ki phone se nikalne vaala radiation sperm ke liye nuksaan daayak hai or ye infertility kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Many research has been done to determine the effects of cell phone radiation on sperm count
 central european jarnal of urology main 2014 ke risears main paaya gaya ki jin purushon ne apane phone ko lambey samay tak saamne kii jeb main rakhaa, unamem sperm kii sankhya kam thi or DNA frangmentation ke saath sperm cells kii sankhya zyada thi

 com kii ek report kahati he ki fertility ke lihaaj se mahilaon kii tulana main phone radiation kaa zyada asar purushon par hota he
 This is due to the location of sperm and ovaries
 overi mahilaon ke sharir main kaaphi andar maujuud hote hai jahaan tak radiation kaa asar aasaani se nahin pahunch paata
 On the other hand, sperm cells in men's body are present in the testis which is outside the body
 aise main radiation kaa asar mahilaon kii tulana main purushon main zyada teji se hota he
 Till now, the effects of the phone on men's fertility have not been formally proven, but the essence is that the phones remove radiation which is not good for sperm

 The debt waiver trump card is being considered for Congress President Rahul Gandhi who is looking for political land with the help of farmers
 haal hi main teen rajyon main karjamaafee ke vaade ne congress ko teen rajyon kii satta main vaapasi kii raah bani
 The Congress government formed in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan implemented the loan waiver immediately after the formation of the government

 aise main basapa adhyaksh mayawati ne congress ke karjamaafee ke gubaare main sui chubhakar hawa nikaalane kii koshish kii

 basapa adhyaksh ne kaha ki congress kii teen rajyon- madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main sarkaar bani, jahaan unhone kiye gaye kisaanon kii karjamaafee ke naam par chalaa he
 Full loan waiver of farmers should be done

 aise main congress and company ko chunaav main sabak sikhaaen
 The interesting thing is that Mayawati is taking strict stance against the Congress and its policies
 lekin congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi basapa supremeo ko lekar naram najar aa rahe hai
 On the Congress not being included in the SP-BSP alliance, Rahul said that we respect both (mayawati and Akhilesh)
 unke paas apni icchaanusaar faisle lene kaa puraa adhikaar he
 We will definitely fight in Uttar Pradesh and surprise the people
 congress party apni vichaardhaara par chunaav ladegi
 Mayawati had not previously formed any alliance with the Congress in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan as well
 jabaki congress teenon rajyon main basapa ke saath milakar chunaav ladanaa chaahati thi
 Mayawati had attacked the Congress in a similar manner during the election campaign, but after the results came out, she played an important role in forming the government by supporting the Congress in all three states

 In Chhattisgarh, now government employees and officers are allowed to have more than two children
 iske pehle do se zyada bachche paidaa karne vaale karmi kai tarah kii sarkari suvidhaon or vetan bhatton ke hakdaar nahin hote the
 Sub-rule 4 of Rule 22 of Chhattisgarh Civil Services (conduct) Rules 1965 provided that the government servant would follow the policies related to family welfare
 udhar sarkaar ke is faisle kaa congress ne virodh kiya he
 Congress opposed the decision, 'we do, our two' This slogan of family planning that has been in place for decades will no longer be applicable in Chhattisgarh
 chhattisgarh main un sarkari afasaron or karmchaariyon ke liye khushkhabari he, jo do yaa do se adhik bachche paidaa karnaa chaahate hai
 They will no longer have to think about it because the government has allowed it
 rajya kii raman sarkaar ne cabinet kii baithak main shaskeey sevakon ke do yaa do se adhik bachche paidaa karne ko avchaar maane jane vaale praavdhaan ko villopit karne kaa nirnay liya he
 This will allow government employees and officials to have more than two children
 yah faisla sabhi dharmon or jatiyon ke sarkari karmiyon par lagu hoga
 However, the main opposition party of the state Congress has opposed this decision of the BJP government
 party kii daleel he ki jab desh main khadyaan kii kami ho rahi he or to or mahangaai par sarkaar kaa koi niyantran nahin he, aise samay parivaar niyojan ko nirarthak sabit karne kaa faisla bemaani he
 There are around 17 lakh government employees in Chhattisgarh, this is the first time in Chhattisgarh, when the BJP government of the state has taken a decision out of the box for government employees
 iske pehle sarkari karmiyon kii niyukti transfar or vetan bhatton ko lekar rajya sarkaar faisle liya karti thi
 The number of government employees in Chhattisgarh is around 17 lakhs
 hairat main hai sarkari karmchaariek survey ke mutabik rajya main sarkari mulajimon main 25 se 35 varsh kii aayu ke karmiyon kii sankhya 38 fisadi ke lagbhag he, jabaki 40 se 50 varsh kii umr ke 85 fisadi or 50 se 60 varsh kii umr ke karmichaariyon va adhikariyon kii sankhya maatr 17 fisadi he
 Who will benefit from this decision of the government, but the government employees and officials themselves are surprised by the exemption given in the matter of family planning
 udhrapariwaar niyojanako datta bataane ke maamle main sarkaar kaa apana tark he
 This is the rationale of the government, according to the state agriculture minister Brijmohan Agarwal, it is the human right of every government worker to produce as many children as he wants
 is par sarkaar kaa koi niyantran nahin hona chahie
 According to him, when no rules have been imposed on non-governmental children, there should be no rules for government employees as well
 ise kisi dharm yaa jati se jod kar nahin dekha janaa chahie
 To control the population, the rule 'hum do, hamare do', this slogan of family planning is prevalent throughout the country
 yah isliye aam logon tak pahunchaaya gaya taaki desh kii aabaadi niyantrit rahe or aam aadmi kaa jivan str sudhare
 This family planning rule was applied to employees whose children were born on or after 26 January 2001
 chhattisgarh civil seva aacharan niyam 1965 ke niyam 22 ke up niyam 4 main yah praavdhaan he ki prayek shaskeey sevak bharat sarkaar yaa rajya sarkaar ke parivaar kalyaan se sambandhit nitiyon kaa paalan karegaa, lekin ab chhattisgarh main yah niyam kargar nahin hoga

1 team in the Test at the moment and it is largely due to the team Captain Virat Kohli's love and respect for Test cricket goes to him
 jahir un khilaadiyon main se rahe hai jo ganguli, dhoni or kohli (ipel) kii captaini main khel chuke hai
 Zaheer believes that Kohli meets Ganguly to a great extent as captain

 Zaheer Khan said, "virat is very much like Ganguly, he is very bold in his decisions and always inspires the team
" unki behtareen ballebaaji form bhi unki captaini main dikhti he
 i want him to win the World Cup one day
 ' jahir khan ne kaha he ki viraat kohli kii captaini vaali team ke paas world cricket kaa sarvshereshth gendbaaji akraman he
 India had the best bowler in the world, Zaheer said before the Test series against South Africa and India that it was the right time to become a fast bowler in India
 jahir ne kaha ki unhen jasprit bumraah, mohammad shami or eshanth sharma jaise khilaadiyon ko dekhakar or zyada khushi milti he, kyonki yah log lagaataar acha pradarshan kar rahe hai

 ' unhone kaha, 'ek gendbaaj ke taur par mujhe kaaphi khushi hoti he or main ummid karata hum ki yah log isi tarah mehnat karnaa jari rakhenge or apni lay ko banaae rakhenge jiske kaaran inhen yah parinaam mili hai
 Bumrah will not play in the upcoming South African series due to injury

 Regarding Bumrahbumrah, which has matured a lot in the past years, Zaheer said, 'I have seen Bumrah since he was quite young
 mumbai indinyas ke saath shuruaati dinon main vah behad pratibhashali he or main is baat se khush hum ki vah beete varshon main kaaphi paripakv hue hai or apni team ke liye unhone kaaphi shandaar pradarshan kiya he
 Zaheer said, 'bumrah's unique action has come for him
 mujhe lagata he ki unhen sirf apni fitness par kaam karne kii jarurat he or bina kisi atirikt dabaav ke aage badhanaa hoga
 On Rohit's opener in Zaheer Netest, he said, "seeing the form he has shown in the last six months, you cannot keep a player like Rohit out of the final-11"
 hamen intjaar karnaa hoga or dekhnaa hoga, haalanki mujhe unki kaabiliyat par koi andeh nahin he
 ' malaysia main rahane vaale bhartiya nai desh main sabase prasiddh hindu utsavon main se ek thaipusam ke dauraan shraddhaluon dwaara kataae gaye saikadon kilogram bal bechakar paisa kamaane kii yojana bana rahe hai
 28-year-old a Karthikeyan, a Tamil Nadu resident who works as a hairdresser, said that instead of throwing hair, local traders can make a lot of money by selling them to international wig makers
 kartikeyan ne kaha, kaate gaye bal batorne vaale shaks ko ye bal bechakar main amir ban gaya hota
 The local barbers seem unaware of these occasions as they are usually thrown into a nearby river after the hair is harvested
 thaipusam ke dauraan hajaaron kii taadaad main hindu shraddhalu apane bal katwane batu kevs mandir main aate hai
 Here the hair of about 150 barber people is cut
 kartikeyan ne kaha ki bharat main logon ko kharidaar kii baat johne kii jarurat nahin padati kyonki ve unhen talash lete hai or badale main behatar bhugtan bhi kiya jaataa he
 The rain has once again brought trouble in Mumbai
 desh kii aarthik rajdhani kahe jane vaale shahar ke uttari ilaake main shanivaar raat se hi ruk-ruk kar barish ho rahi he, jiske chalate yahaan kaa janajivan ast-vyast ho gaya he
 According to news agency ANI, Mumbai has received more than 30 mm of rain in about two days
 barish se sabase zyada yahaan ke hindmata or malad ilaake main pani bhar gaya he
 Alam is that the railway track here is flooded
 railway ne ambernath-badlapur block par ravivaar ko chalane vaali sabhi trainon kii awajahi par roak laga di he
 Apart from this, Navi Mumbai, Jogeshwari, Vile Parle and Malwani also have bad condition due to rain water
 maaloom ho ki is saal mumbai main 13 june ko monsoon ne dastak di thi
 Mumbai was waterlogged even in the first monsoon rains
 tej hawaaon ke saath kareeb ek ghante barish hui thi
 More than 14 trees fell in different parts of the city due to rain and thunderstorms
 isse kai ilaakon main trephic jam ho gaya or logon ko ghar pahunchane main ghanton lage
 It is known that this year in Mumbai, the monsoon knocked on 13 June
 monsoon kii pehali barish main bhi mumbai pani-pani ho gai thi
 It had rained for about an hour with strong winds
 barish or aandhi kii vajah se shahar ke alag-alag hisse main 14 se zyada ped gir gaye the
 This caused traffic jams in many areas and took people hours to reach home
 jammu-kashmir main esemes seva ko band kar diya gaya
 On Monday, postpaid mobile network service was restored after 72 days, SMS service was stopped a few hours after that
 somvaar ke baad ghati ke kareeb 40 lakh postped mobile phone ne kaam karnaa shuru kar diya he
 However, amidst all this, a new problem has emerged for the people there
 mobile phone sevaayen to behaal ho gai hai, lekin outgowing kol logon ke liye samasya kaa sabab ban gaya he
 Most mobile users have been billed for the last 72 days and their outgoing services have been stopped due to non-submission of bills
 bataa den, kashmir main internet seva ko abhi tak behaal nahin kiya gaya he, jis vajah se logon ne bill kaa bhugtan nahin kiya he
 Significantly, on August 5, the communication services were completely stopped after the decision to remove special state status (article 370) from Jammu and Kashmir and divide it into two union territories
 sanchaar sevaaon ko band karnaa sarkaar kii taraf se uthaae gaye ehtiyaati upayon kaa hissaa tha, jiske tahat rajanetaaon kii najarbandi, atirikt surakshabalon kii tainaati or sailaaniyon ko ghati se hataanaa shaamil tha
 All these steps were taken to prevent conflicts there
 ghati main lagbhag 70 lakh mobile conection hai
 Of these, 40 lakh postpaid phones have started functioning and there are three million prepaid phones, which have not been restored yet
 haalanki is baat kaa bhi zikr nahin kiya gaya he ki internet sevaayen kab se behaal kii jaaengi

 But the feelings of those who were living together are envious

 ' BJP president Amit Shah on Sunday targeted the Congress over its leader Sam Pitroda's statement 'hua to Hua'
 shah ne congress pramukh rahul gandhi se poocha ki kya pitroda dwaara sikhon kii hatya ko "jaij" tehraane ke baad maafee maangane se maamla khatm ho gaya
 Shah said that the Narendra Modi government has ensured justice to the families of the 1984 riot victims
 shah ne kaha, "vah modi sarkaar thi jisane sikh virdohi dangon main shaamil logon ko salaakhon ke peeche daalana sunishchit kiya
 He said that the families of the victims have also been compensated

 unhone kaha, "pitroda se (tippanee ke liye) congress adhyaksh maafee maangane ke liye kah rahe hai
 i want to ask the Congress President whether your leader, who justified the Sikh massacre, apologized, and the matter ended
 agar 1984 ke dangon main nyaay dene kaa congress kaa koi iraadaa hota, to aaropee salaakhon ke peeche hote or peedit pariwaron ko muaavja diya gaya hota
 But the Congress party always ignored the 1984 riots
 gauratlab he ki sam pitroda ne 1984 sikh virdohi dange ko lekar ek bayaan diya tha
 In a statement to NI, Pitroda said that i do not think about it, it is also another lie

 It happened in 84 years
 aapane kya kiya'? unke is bayaan par kendriya mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha ki pitroda kii tippaniyan "hairaan" karne vaali hai or kisi ko bhi isaki ummid nahin thi
 Javadekar said, "he (pitroda) said that the 1984 massacre took place
 to kya? desh ko yah puri tarah se asweekaarya he or ham ise bardaashat nahin kar sakate
 "the BJP leader accused the Congress of playing with the sentiments of the people
 jaavdekar ne kaha, "pitroda rajeev gandhi ke saathi or rahul gandhi ke guru hai
 If the Guru is like this, what will 'chela' be like? This is what Congress is doing

 In the elections held in 222 seats, BJP got 104 seats and BS Yeddyurappa took the oath of CM post
 haalanki, 55 ghante baad hi unhen istipha dena pad gaya
 There was so much upheaval in the state politics that CM Yeddyurappa had to resign before the majority test
 congress (78 siten) or jedies (37 siten) ke netaaon ne is maamle main rajyapal kii bhoomika ko sawaalon ke ghere main rakhaa or supreme court tak gaye
 Yeddyurappa claimed to save the government till the last moment, but Amit Shah, who played a leading role during the entire elections, did not appear in the matter
 yah haalia samay main amit shah kii duusari ranneetik haar thi
 Resort Politics played an important role in both Amit Shah's strategic defeats
 sanyog yah he ki donon maukon par karnataka kaa eagleton resort prishthbhumi main rahaa
 This resort had been in the national headlines even before this
 amit shah kii donon haar main is resort kii bhoomikapichley saal gujarat main teen siton ke liye rajyasabha chunaav hai
 BJP president Amit Shah wanted to beat Ahmed Patel, the second most powerful man in the Congress in the election for three Rajya Sabha seats in Gujarat, but could not succeed in it
 in donon netaaon kii adaavat gujarat kii raajnneeti se shuru hokar rashtriya falak tak ai he
 The funny thing is that Amit Shah had to face defeat even then and now
 donon baar amit shah kii haar or congress kii jeet main karnataka ke eagleton resort kaa bhi zikr hua
 During the Gujarat Rajya Sabha elections, 44 Congress mlas stayed in this resort
 unhen voting se ek din pehle hi gujarat laayaa gaya tha or ahamed patel rajyasabha pahunche
 This time also, the Congress MLA from Karnataka stayed at Eagleton Resort and finally Yeddyurappa had to resign
 congress sarkaar laga chuki he karodon kaa jurmaanceksar congress ke kaam aane vaale is resort par congress kii hi sarkaar baari-bharkam jurmaana bhi laga chuki he
 Last time, just before the Gujarat mlas stayed here, the state Congress government had imposed a fine of around Rs 1000 crore on the resort alleging encroachment of 77 acres of land
 yah kadam congress sarkaar kii cabinet ne supreme court ne nirdeshon par uthaaya tha
 The BJP had given the land 82 in 2012 from the state government of the BJP
 6 karod rupee kaa shulk lekar ise 77 acre jameen dene ke paksh main thi
 However, the decision was later overturned by the Congress government
 bataa den ki is ki is resort ke ek kamare kaa ek din kaa kiraaya 8 hajaar rupee se lekar 10 hajaar rupee tak he
 Amit Shah's hand in ticket distribution Amit Shah had camped here before the Karnataka elections
 is dauraan unhone party kaaryakartaaon ko sangathit karne ke alaava gutbaji par bhi lagaam lagaai
 Amit Shah along with Yeddyurappa also took important decisions on ticket distribution
 reddy bandhuon or unke rishtedaaron ko tikat dene kaa faisla ho yaa yediurppa ke bete vijayendra kaa tikat kaatane kaa faisla puure chunaavon ke dauraan party amit shah kii ranneeti par bharosa karti rahi
 Shah had a fight Rahul Gandhi, like Amit Shah of SEBJP, was also the Congress President Rahul Gandhi in the political battle of Karnataka
 haalanki, congress ke kheme main tikat bantwaare ke dauraan rahul gandhi se zyada purv siem siddharmaiya kii chali thi
 Siddaramaiah played the most important role, from taking his son Yatindra from his seat Varuna to contesting from two seats or giving tickets to the youth
 is kaam main shah rahul se baaji maar le gaye
 Even PM Modi could not put up even during the election campaign in Naiya Parkarnataka, till the Congress Narendra Modi did not enter the field, the Congress camp seemed to be making an edge
 tatkaaleen siem siddharmaiya akele hi piem narendra modi or siddharmaiya ko soshal media or apni reliyon main nishane par le rahe the
 After Modi's campaign, he had made the contest between Modi vs Rahul and after this the national level issues, not the state, came up

 Corey Anderson scored the highest 34 runs for New Zealand
 luk ronchi ne aakhir main 11 gendon par naabad 21 ran kii pari kheli jisase newjiland saat wicket par 126 ran ke chunauteepurn score tak pahunchane main safal rahaa
 With the Kiwi spin trio taking nine wickets ahead, the pitch started slowing down and the same score proved to be a mountain for India
 newjiland ke teenon spinneron mishael santner (11 ran dekar chaar wicket), ish sodhi (18 ran dekar teen wicket) or nathan maikalam (15 ran do wicket) ne spin khilne main maahir bhartiya ballebaaji ko tharra diya

 In this way, the Kiwi team was also successful in stopping India's victory campaign
 newjiland ne bharat ke khilaaf ab tak sabhi paanchon tii20 match jite hai
 New Zealand did not land with fast bowlers like Tim Southee and Trent Boult but their spinners gave them a great start
 of brake gendbaaj maikalam ne pehle over main hi shikhar dhawan (01) ko elbeadblyoo out kiya
 Kane Williamson handed the ball to left-arm spinner Santner as the first change in the third over
 unhone rohit sharma (05) or suresh raina (01) ko out karke bhartiya kheme main khalabali machaa di
 India's wickets continued to fall, New Zealand handed the ball to leg-spinner Sodhi in the ninth over and he managed to get his team's most valuable wicket as soon as he came
 kohli unki leg brake ko aage badhkar cover kii taraf khelnaa chaahate the lekin vah balle kaa kinaaraa lekar wicketiper ronchi ke surakshit dastaanon main samaa gai
 The order of falling wickets did not stop
 hardik pandya (01) ko santner kii sidhi lekin apekshaakrit tej gend samaj main nahin ai jo wicket ke aage unke pad se takaraai
 In the next over, Ravindra Jadeja tried to turn Sodhi to the leg by going to the front foot but he bounced off the edge of the bat and the bowler completed the rest
 score ho gaya saat wicket par 43 ran
 The Indian bowler also wanted 61 runs in four overs when Dhoni hit Sodhi for the first six of the innings but it was successful in dismissing leg-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin (10) who shared a 30-run partnership in six overs with the captain
 santner ne dhoni ke rup main apana chauthaa wicket liya jo unka sarvshereshth pradarshan he
 Sodhi also gave the best performance of his career
 isse pehle bhartiya gendbaajon ne bhi apana kamaal dikhaaya
 Jaspreet Bumrah (1 wicket for 15 runs) presented an unmatched sample of his yorker
 spinneron main suresh raina (chaar over main 16 ran dekar ek wicket) sabase safal rahe
 Ashwin and Jadeja failed to make much of an impact, while Ashish Nehra (one wicket for 21 runs in three overs) was successful in the restart
 ballebaaji ke liye aasaan nahin thi pichado ‘big heater’ ke pavilion lautne ke baad williamson (16 gendon par aath ran) par pari sanvaarane kii jimmedaari thi lekin raina ne unhen stump out kara diya

 For the first time, Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel has reacted to this, amid the uproar in the country over the Punjab National Bank scam
 patel ne kaha he ki banking sector main aae din saamne aa rahi ghotaalon kii khabar se hamen bhi dukh hota he
 We are also angry to see these scams in the banking sector
 unhone kaha ki ham banking sector ko bachaane ke liye nilkanth banakar jehar pine ko bhi taiyaar hai
 Actually, RBI was getting criticized for PNB fraud for the last several days
 isamen arabiai kii taraf se kuch kadaa kadam na uthaae jane ko lekar sawaal uthaaya ja rahaa tha
 To this, the RBI governor said that RBI cannot be present everywhere to prevent such incidents
 unhone kaha ki kai kaarobaari hai, jo bank adhikariyon kii mileebhagat se desh ko luutane main lage hue hai
 This is causing the loss of the country
 arabiai governor ne kaha ki banking sector ko is sthiti se baahar nikaalane ke liye ham (arabiai) hameshaa taiyaar rahenge
 He said that if we have to drink poison to save the sector by becoming 'neelkanth', then we will be ready for it
 ham apana ferj nibhaate rahenge
 Explain that the Reserve Bank of India is continuously taking action after the PNB Ghatala of Rs 12400 crore came to the fore
 urjit patel ke bayaan se pehle hi bhartiya rigerv bank ne bada ection liya he
 RBI has scrapped the facility of issuing letter of intent to banks
 iske saath hi kendriya bank ne letters of confort (loc) ko bhi khatm kar diya he
 Both these instruments were used by banks to guarantee their customers
 iskaa sabase zyada asar hira or jewelery kaa bade str par aayaat karne vaale kaarobaariyon par padegaa
 The action on behalf of the central bank was taken after the Punjab National Bank scam
 is faisle ke jariye arabiai banking vyavastha main saamne aa rahi khaamiyon ko dur karne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Once the lou and loc systems are scrapped, traders can continue to provide bank letters of credit and guarantees
 yah vyavastha sucharu rup se chalati rahegi
 This arrangement is in accordance with international standards
 ye vyavastha credit jari karne vaale kaa paksh majboot karata he
 In fact, whenever a bank issues guarantees and locs to pay money to a businessman, the receiving bank also checks at its level under this arrangement
 is vyavastha main guarantee risive karne vaala bank apane str par yah dekhtaa he ki jise vah paise dene vaala he, uski credit history kitni majboot or kamjor he
 This significantly reduces the responsibility of the bank issuing the loc
 vahiin, lou or letters of confort kii baat karen, to isamen karj dene vaale bank inhen jari karne vaale bank kii guarantee ke aadhaar par hi paisa de dete hai
 In this he does not conduct any kind of investigation at his level
 kyonki lou main ek tarah se ise jari karne vaala bank guarantee detaa he ki graahak ke difolt hone par vah bhugtan kar degaa
 Bankers say that the letter of credit is more secure
 kyonki is par ayatak kii jaankaree, jari karne kii taarikh, expyri date or jis saamaan ko kharidne ke liye yah liya ja rahaa he, uski jaankaree bhi hoti he
 This does not happen in the case of but lou
 is vajah se inamen gadabadi kaa pataa lagaana kaaphi zyada mushkil ho jaataa he
 What is lou? Letter of Undertaking (lou) is a kind of bank guarantee
 yah aayaat ke liye oversij bhugtan karne ke liye jari kiya jaataa he

 # metoo campaign soshal media par viral hone ke baad kai bollywood or tivi celebs ne khud ke saath hui bhayaavah ghatana kaa zikr karnaa shuru kiya he
 Now serial 'ishqbaaz' actress Shrenu Parikh has revealed the case of childhood molestation
 actress ne insta acount par ek post share kar bataaya ki 6 saal kii umr main local bas ke andar ek aadmi ne unke saath chhedchhad kii thi
 # metoo: Terrifying stories of sexual harassment of women, she wrote, "as a child, i used to go to my maternal grandfather to spend my holidays
 tab ham local bas se travel karte the
 i was getting into a bus with Nana
 siten bhari hui thim to naanaa mere liye seat maangane lage
 Just then a man told himself that he would make me sit on his lap
 jiske baad usne mujhe galat jagahon par choona shuru kiya
 "as a kid i used to spend my vacations at my grandparents" town! Those days we travelled in a local bus! And when the seats used to be occupied my grandfather used to request someone to share the seat for me! Like one uncle offered to nanu that “il make her sit on my lap” He willingly agreed thought atleast i won't get tired, he made me sit on his lap! Me as a child couldn't know what's gonna happen to me i dozed off, only woke up to the feeling of being inappropriately being touched by that uncle! i could sense somethings wrong but i went all numb and thought it's ok for him to hold me like that! i could see my naanu standing a little away from me but couldn't tell him anything not then not later! i wish i would have spoken about it, i wish that man would've gotten his share of punishment for molesting a 6 year old! Not once but so many such incidents have happened, I've known from my friends but we never talk about it! Never raise our voices cz we r scared of how the society will eventually not believe us and we don't stand for ourselves! What's happening with Gauri is something I'm sure we all have faced on some or the other level in our lives! And that's why I'm so glad we did this track so that women can come out and speak
 If we don’t own our truth nobody else will
 This is just a small attempt to create a space for all of us to share our stories and raise our voices! # ishqbaa az # metooa post shared byshrenu Parikh (@shrenuparikhofficial) onmay 29, 2018 at 12:12 pm PDT She further writes, "I didn't understand anything, i was shocked
 mere nanu mujhase kuch dur khadey the
 i could not tell them anything then or after that
 kaash main bol paati to us aadmi ko 6 saal kii ladki ko chhedane kii sajaa milti
 "mallika locked herself in a cage in Cannes, this was the motive"
 Not many incidents like this happen
 ham apni aawaaj nahin uthaate kyonki hamen samaaj kaa dar hota he
 All of us have endured such incidents at some time
 mujhe khushi he ki mahilaayein ab aise maamalon par chuppi todakar aawaaj uthaane lagi hai
 It is a small initiative that all of you also share your story and raise your voice

 Journalist Ved Pratap Vedic's meeting with Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the Mumbai attacks and the head of the jamaat-ud-dawa, and his disputed statement on Kashmir has created a furore from Parliament to the street
 vaidic ne aarope lagaaya ki congress is masale ko bevajaah tool dekar raajnneetik laabh uthaa rahi he
 Giving clarification on behalf of Rahul Gandhi, calling him a man of the Sangh, he said, 'I have never been a member of the RSS, never been associated with any party but i had close relations with the leaders of the Congress only
 narsimha raav mujhe sammaan dete the or unke samay laag mujhe dipti piem bulaate the
 On the question of defamation case against Rahul, Vedic said, 'I am a very small person in front of Rahul Gandhi, will i file a case against him
 mere paas itane paise hi nahin hai ki manahani kaa cese karun
 'political parties are demanding an inquiry into the matter
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne hafiz-vaidic kii mulaakaat par centre sarkaar se jawaab maanga he
 Rahul has called Vedic an 'RSS man'
 unhone kaha, 'sarkaar ko yah bataanaa hoga ki vaidic kii hafiz said kii mulaakaat vahaan ke bhartiya ucchayog ne to nahin karai he?' aresas ke purv pravaktaa em ji vaidya ne rahul ke bayaan par chutki lee he
 Vaidya said in Nagpur, 'it may be that the people of the Vedic Union
 rahul gandhi ke bayaan se aisa lagata he ki wo aresas ke bare main zyada jaanate hai
 However, JD (U) spokesperson Casey Tyagi has supported Rahul
 shiv sena ne vaidic ke khilaaf kadi karrwai kii maang kii he
 Shiv Sena Spokesperson Sanjay Raut said that Kasab-like action should be taken against Vedic
 vahiin, rahul ke bayaan par aapatti jataate hue kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu ne kaha ki is masale se aresas kaa kya lenaa-dena he
 In the PMO, Minister of State Jitendra Singh has said that Rahul Gandhi should not give such a statement unless there is evidence
 bijepi netaa ram madhav ne kaha ki hafiz said bharat kaa apradhi he
 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj has given clarification on behalf of the government
 unhone kaha ki pakistan jane se pehle yaa pakistan jane ke baad vaidic ne sarkaar ko koi soochna nahin di thi ki wo hafiz said se milane vaale hai
 When the proceedings of the House started on Tuesday, the opposition parties created a ruckus, due to which the proceedings of Rajya Sabha and then of Lok Sabha had to be postponed
 loksabhaa kii kaarywahi dobaaraa shuru hui to sushamaa ne kaha, 'yah unki (vaidic kii) nijee yatra or vyaktigat mulaakaat thi
 It is unfortunate to make such allegations that the Vedic had gone as messengers or disciples
 vaidic kii mulaakaat se sarkaar kaa koi vaasta nahin he
 Disputed statement on Kashmir Meanwhile, another controversy related to Vedic has emerged after meeting terrorist Hafiz Saeed
 vaidic ne kashmir ko lekar pakistani tivi channel 'don news' ko vivaadaaspad intervyuu diya he
 He has said that there is no harm in the independence of Kashmir if India and Pakistan wish
 vaidic ke kashmir par die bayaan ke baad desh kii siyasat main bhuuchaal aa gaya he
 Vedic has given clarification today after being surrounded all-round
 unhone kaha ki wo algaavvaad ke khilaaf hai, aazaadee ke khilaaf nahin
 He said, 'I talked about the independence of Kashmir but never talked of separating Kashmir from India
 ' vaidic ne intervyuu dikhaane vaale channel par aarope lagaaya ki publicity ke liye unki baton ko kaat-chhaant kar dikhaaya gaya he
 Earlier, there was a ruckus in the Rajya Sabha on Monday on the vedic-hafiz meeting issue
 saansadon ne poocha ki abhi tak is maamle main koi karrwai kyon nahin kii gai he
 In New Delhi, Hindu Rashtra Sena activists also took to the streets to protest against Vedic
 bhopal main congress kaaryakartaaon ne vaidic kaa putala jalaayaa
 Apart from this, KP Unnikrishnan, father of NSG commando Major Sandeep, who was martyred in the Mumbai attack, has objected to Vedic's meeting with Saeed
 unhone kaha ki hafiz said se vaidic kii mulaakaat se main hill gaya hum
 i want to know who allowed Vedic to meet Saeed? ”unnikrishnan said,“ This is amazing
 main is puure maamle or us par baba ramdev ke unka bachaav karne se behad hataash or niraash hum
 This is not a case of insult to a martyr, i am unable to understand what he (vedic) was doing there

 Former veteran cricketer and BJP MP Gautam in the 'first time, Parliament door' session on December 17 on the second day of the 8th edition of 'agenda Aaj Tak', many veteran parliamentarian Ravi Kishan reached the 'first time, Parliament door' session
 Gambhir, BJP MP from Gorakhpur Ravi Kishan and Congress MP from Andaman Nicobar Kuldeep Rai Sharma joined
 unhone har sawaal kaa bebaaki se jawaab diya
 On the experience of Parliament, Ravi Kishan said that i was very fortunate to have traveled from clay house to here
 kariyar ke peak par yahaan tak aana yani prakruti se aap jo lete hai, use lautnaa he
 This thinking was from childhood because the priest had a son, so he had to return, but did not know what to return
 ravi kishan ne kaha ki jab duniya ghoomane lage to pataa chalaa ki maanavtaa lautnaa he
 Attending 100% in the House, he said that i am very impressed by PM Modi's selfless attitude
 piem modi, grahamantri amit shah or siem yogi aditya nath ne mujhe mauka diya or main shiv bhakt hum to mujhe dharti bhi gorakhpur mili
 Won by historical vote here
 aaj main vahaan ke logon kii seva kar rahaa hum
 Ever since i won the election, i have been able to visit Mumbai only 4 to 5 times
 main yaa to apane sansadeey kshetra main rahata hum yaa phir sadan yaa party ke campineng main laga rahata hum
 My House Attendance is also 100%
 unhone kaha ki gorakhpur main sab bam-bam he
 The National School of Drama is my dream project
 north india ke bahut se bachche dilli nahin aa pate
 This is under consideration
 saath hi gorakhpur ko hub banane par centre or rajya sarkaar focus kar rahi he
 We are preparing quite a strong road map
 airport ko lekar bhi kaaphi kaam hona he
 i am there for the public at all times
 loktantr main shanti se sab sambhavjamiya hinsa par gorakhpur se saansad ravi kishan ne kaha ki loktantr main shanti se sabakuch ho saktaa he
 You perform in peace, but if you sabotage it is wrong
 mujhe pataa chalaa tha ki jamiya main bahari log andar ghuse the, jiskaa phayda tisare log le rahe hai
 Children are being instigated by outsiders
 students ko pataa hi nahin he ki wo virodh kyon kar rahe hai
 He said that many people do not understand this bill
 is bill se desh ke logon kaa koi lenaa-dena nahin he, jo log peedit hai, naagarikta chaahate hai, ye bill unke liye he
 Why do you support Hindu Rashtra? On this Ravi Kishan said that i am a student of history
 is desh main hindu the
 i am the son of a priest
 yahaan puri birdari hindu thi
 Christian, Yaduhi is everyone's own country
 kahaan-koun bhadkaa rahaa he?unhone kaha, '2014 se pradhanmantri narendra modi ke aane ke baad naa koi hindu-muslim main danga hua or naa kisi musalmaan kii property lee gai
 Then, where and who has instigated the community that Modi ji is coming
 modi ji aa rahe hai, modi ji aa rahe hai or aap surakshit nahin ho
 Everybody is cool
 sab jagah bam-bam he
 After all, why are they being intimidated in the name of Modi ji
 ye samudaay kyon modi ji ke naam par daregaa
 Bring some evidence to show that there is danger due to Modi ji
 ' ravi kishan ne kaha bill bina padhe hi afvaah failaa diya gaya
 i want to say that there is no threat to any Muslim in this country
 ' What happened in the country, the world, the metropolis, sports, economic and Bollywood
 jaanane ke liye yahaan padhein samay ke saath saath khabaron kaa live apadation

 Railway Minister Piyush Goyal on Wednesday once again spoke of the bumper vacancy under which the recruitment of two lakh 32 thousand unemployed people was announced
 khabar sunakar aapako bhi laga hoga ki sarkaar ab berozegaron kaa kitna khyaal rakh rahi he
 But now the shocking thing has come to the fore that the Railways have also earned about Rs
 125 crores from these unemployed from last year's recruitment examination
 pichley saal farvari main jab railway ne kareeb sava lakh padon kii bhartee nikaali to kareeb 2 karod 37 lakh aavedan mili
 Facing all the challenges on the basis of ability, these students reached their respective centers from far flung areas
 ab RTI ke jawaab main pataa chalaa ki in berojgaaron se exam fees ke naam par railway ne ek nahin do nahin balki kareeb 900 karod rupye bhi liye
 RTI activist of Bhopal Dr
 prakaash agarwal kehete hai ki kaaphi mashkkat ke baad railway ne aankada diya
 In this, the railways admitted that about Rs 900 crore came to its account from 1 lakh 27 thousand candidates in the name of examination fees
 saath main kaha ki jo parikshaarthi upasthit hue unako paisa lautaanaa bhi he
 The Secretary of the Railway Board demanded the removal of the Minister's OSD, transferred to himself
 Actually, the Railways had made two types of provision in the examination fees
 general or riserved category
 Rs 500 was to be given to the general category, out of which Rs 400 would be returned to those who appeared in the examination
 arakshit (reserved category) shrenee vaale chaatro ko 250 rupee or pariksha main upasthit hone par ye puure paise unke khate main railway ne bhejne kii shart rakhi
 And all those who do not appear in the examination will go to the vault of the railway
 sieji report : railway main theke par kaam kar rahe mazaduron ko lut rahe hai thekedaarelway board ke purv sadsy subodh jain daleel dete hai ki exam fees ke peeche mansha yahi hoti he ki exam main laganevaala kharch nikal paae or non syrius chaatr aavedan nahin karen kyonki koi bevajaah applai karata he to uske intazaam main railway ko kharch karnaa padataa he
 Even after returning the examination fees, out of 887 crores, about 427 crores remained in the vault of the railway
 2 karod 37 lakh chaatro ne aavedan kiya
 In this, a total of 83 lakh 88 thousand students of general and reserved categories did not come for the examination
 to inkaa puraa paisa railway ke khate main hi gaya
 According to railway sources, about 50,32,800 of the students who did not appear for the examination, ie 60 per cent were in the general category, in which the Railways took Rs 500 from everyone
 to saamaanya shrenee ke chaatro se railway ko 251 karod 64 lakh rupee aamad hui
 About 33,55,200 students who were absent were from the reserved category
 inamen 250 rupee har chaatr se railway ne charge kiye
 So they brought Rs 83 crore 88 lakh to the railway account
 lihaaza form bharne ke baad pariksha nahin dene pahunche chaatro se railway kii tijori main 335 karod 52 lakh rupee aae
 At the same time, according to the railway, the total number of students who appeared in the examination was 10 million 53 million
 ab agar iskaa 60% bhi chaatr saamaanya shrenee (general category) ke maane jinke 500 rupee main se 400 rupee vaapasi ke baad 100 rupee railway ke khate main jane the to aise chaatro kii taadaad 91 lakh 80 hazaar banati he
 And at the rate of Rs 100, the earning from these students is 91
8 million
 in sabhi aankadon ko jod ghataav kar dekhen to phir anupasthit or pariksha main upasthit saamaanya shrenee se kul kamai kaa aankada 427 karod 32 lakh rupee banataa he
 The center of lakhs of students in the 1
25 lakh vacancy was also in a remote area
 lihaaza unako jahaan centre tak pahunchane main kaaphi asuvidha hui vahiin berojgaaron se railway kii jo kamai philhal 427 karod he, agar rail mantri ke buudhvaar ke 2 lakh 32 hazaar nai vaikency kii bahaali kii nazar se dekhen to railway berojgaaron se isse bhi kahin zyaada kii kamai unki bhartee ke naam par kar legaa
 The unemployed may or may not get railway jobs, but the railways have made big money from these unemployed

 According to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, there were 175,785 confirmed cases of swine flu reported in the news yesterday, including 1,116 deaths
 dabluechao ke kaaryvahak sahaayak mahanideshak kiji phukuda ne ek saakshaatkaar main bataaya ki koi sateek aankada dena to naammumkin he lekin ateet kii mahamariyon par najar daalane se pataa chalata he ki ek saal main kam se kam ek tihaai aabaadi javanu kii chapet main aa sakati he or yah dar chaahe 20 fisadi ho yaa 40 fisadi, isse koi fark nahin padataa
 Fukuda said that the final transition level in different countries may vary
 lekin meraa maananaa he ki asal main 20, 30 yaa 40 fisadi bahut zyada alag nahin he
 This is just a high percentage which suggests that in the event of an epidemic, you can expect more people to be vulnerable to infection

 This news is certainly shocking
 jis osama ko america beete das saal se dhund rahi thi, chaahe wo jinda mili yaa murda
 That Osama got to America and was also killed
 lekin sawaal he ki osama ke ghar main kya kisi ne use dhokhaa de diya?jis osama ke bare main padosiyon tak ko bhanak nahin thi, vahaan kaise pahunch gayi america jaanbaaj? oparation osama ko lekar uthe in sawaalon main gahare ishaare chupe hue hai
 On the basis of the same gestures, a new news has been prepared that only the young wife of old Laden killed Osama
 amal ne hi america ko abtabad kaa suraag diya tha
 Amal, 28, of Yemen origin, is Osama's youngest wife
 kaise osama se hui amal kii mulaakaat? landan ke ek akhbaar da sande times main ye khabar chhapi ki osama kii maut ke peeche kahin uski bivi amal kii mukhabiri to nahin thi
 Pakistan's Home Minister Rehman Malik also agrees with these reports going on in the foreign media
 malik to yaqini taur par kehete hai ki navy cills ko yahaan tak maaloom tha ki osama apni kilanuma haveli ke kis kamare main maujuud tha
 Pakistan Interior Minister Rehman Malik says that according to my experience as an intelligence officer for many years, according to me, i think that someone from within had told America all the difference
 agar unke paas sateek jaankaree nahin hoti to america commando sidhe osama ke kamare tak nahin pahunch paae hote
 Osama's two wives of Saudi origin are already saying that Amal duped Osama
 
 
 yaa to usne america ko sari jaankaree muhaiyaa karai, yaa fir usne ye mauqaa diya ki america uskaa peechha karte hue osama ke thikaane tak pahunch jaae
 However, different theories have been revealed about this earlier
 vikiliks ke mutabik courier kaa kaam karne vaale do bhaaiyon ke zarie abtabad kaa suraag mila tha
 Later it was also said that the US had detected the rumble of Osama's mansion in Abbottabad with the help of high-tech drones
 
 
 lekin ab bivi ke vishwasghaat vaali theory jor pakad chuki he
 If Osama's youngest wife is being implemented, it is being suspected that he had not supported America in doing Osama's work at all
 amal ne aisa kyon kiya hoga? osama paanch saal se abtabad ke apane bangale main rah rahaa tha
 He lived so secretly that even the neighbors did not even know about it
 ab agar osama kii hi do biviyaan amal par shaq kar rahi hai or pakistani hukumat ko isamen sachai kii chhap dikhti he to iske peeche kuch kaaran hai
 How did the seal commandos reach Osama's room directly? When the American commandos arrived at the bungalow in Abbottabad to kill Osama bin Laden, he went directly to the third floor room in which Osama lived
 america ko itani baarik jaankaree kisne muhaiyaa karaayi
 The special thing is that except for Osama's little wife's execution in that room, very few people were allowed to move
 khud pakistan ke grih mantri bhi ye sawaal uthaa rahe hai ki aakhir osama ke kamare tak kaise pahunch gayi sil commando
 Why did the seal commandos shoot him in the leg? The news also came that when the seal commandos took Osama home, his wife came to the rescue
 
 
 sil commando ne uske pair main goli maari
 After all, what was the reason behind leaving Amal
 
 
 aakhir us puure oparation main duusari mahilaayein bhi maari gayi thim
 Did the courier who reached Osama meet Amal? The first news that Osama died was that the courier who went to Abbottabad's house was the informer of America
 
 
 wo courier osama se bhi miltaa tha or us vakt amal bhi uske saath hi rahati thi
 
 
 According to Pakistani news channel GO TV, the three wives living with Osama are Khairyah Sabira, Siham Sabira and Amal Al Saadah
 osama ke abtabad vaale bangale main hi saudi arab kii rahane vaali usko do biviyaan- kheriyah sabira or siham sabira bhi rahati thim
 Osama did not even give much preference to both of his wives in terms of implementation
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki kahin apni puraani khunnas or sautiya daah main to un biviyon ne amal kaa naam nahin liya
 When the death of the panic-stricken terrorist came all over the world, there was no way to escape
 naa mila hathiyaar uthaane kaa vakt
 
 naa hi koi ladaaka tha, jo ek aadesh par goliyon kii bauchhaar kar den
 But the news came that someone tried to save Osama bin Laden, trembling with fear
 to wo thim uski biviyaan
 But now Osama's youngest wife is being doubted whether she betrayed her husband and killed him
 aakhir amal-al-saadah aisa kyon karti, ye bataane se pehle aap ye jaan lijie ki osama kii jindagi main amal ai kaise
 At the time when Laden was plotting to launch the biggest attack on America, he met Yemen-based amal-al-saadah
 17 saal kii amal al saadah kii khubsuurati laden ko is kadar bhaayi ki usne amal se jabardasti shaadi rachaa lee
 
 
 This is the year 2000
 phir to osama ke rang main amal bhi rangan lagi
 By the profession, Dr
 amal-al Saadah was so enchanted by Osama that instead of saving people's lives, she started supporting Osama in shedding the blood of innocent people
 11 saal main amal ne osama ko teen bacchon kii saugat di- do ladke or ek ladki
 It is said that Osama used to trust the implementation most
 kyonki amal jitani khubasurat he, uskaa dimag usase kahin zyada tej chalata he
 And perhaps using his same vicious mind, Amal tackles Osama
 lekin amal ne aisa kiya kyon hoga
 According to experts, Osama had five marriages and even in the last time he lived with three wives
 aise main ho saktaa he ki biviyon kii ladaai kii keemat osama ko chukaani padi
 The second reason may be that Osama forced Amal to be his wife
 osama bhale hi amal ko bahut maanata tha lekin vaarish ke taur par wo hamaja ko pasand karata tha, jo amal kaa nahin, balki kheriyah sabira kaa betaa he
 (intelligence experts believe that the gap between the age and the coercion of Osama will be upset
 lekin osama ke dar se wo kuch bol nahin paati hogi
 When she thought that Osama was getting weaker now, she might have done all her husband's job as a US spy
 )osama bin laden ko abtabad ke ghar main maarane ke baad uske laash ko to sil commando apane saath le gayi lekin osama ke teen bivi or kuch bacchon samet 15 yaa 16 logon ko pakistan ne apane kabje main le liya
 She had three wives with Osama at her last time
 duniya ke sabase bade aatankwaadi osama bin laden ne kul paanch shaadiyaan kii thi
 Osama married first Najwa Ghanim, second marriage to Khadjiyyah Sharif, third marriage to Khayriyah Sabira, fourth marriage to Siham Sabira and fifth marriage to amal-al-saadah
 26 saal kii umr tak osama do shaadiyaan kar chukaa tha
 The first wife used to remain silent due to the fear of Osama and the second wife would never back down in expressing her intentions
 baad main to usne talaak bhi le liya
 Osama's third marriage at the age of 28 was done by his first wife Najwa
 jiskaa naam tha kheriyah sabira
 Among the three wives of Osama, Khairiyah was the most read
 islamic maamalon kii jaankaar hone ke kaaran kheriyah ne osama ko islam ke bare main or zyada gaharaai se samajhaayaa
 But they did not see the white aspects of religion, however, the same fanatical and crazy thinking brought them both very close
 us kheriyah se hi osama ko uskaa sabase priy betaa hamaja paidaa hua
 Hamza, who is considered more ruthless and staunch than his father
 udhar 9-11 ke hamale ke baad bhi kheriyah osama ke saath hi rahi
 
 
 There was also news about Khairyah that Khairaiah lived with Osama like a shadow from the hills of tora-bora to the mansion of Abbottabad
 teesri bivi behad vafaadaar or osama ko manamafik mili to usne do saal baad hi yani 30 saal kii umr main chauthi shaadi kar lee
 Osama's fourth marriage to Siham Sabira
 
 
 ye wo vakt tha jab osama ne tay kar liya tha ki use jehad ke raste par chalanaa he
 
 
 4 children were born to Siham from Siham
 9 / 11 ke baad kheriyah yani osama kii teesri bivi ke saath chauthi bivi siham bhi osama ke saath afghanistan chali gai
 Amal along with these Khairaiyahs and Sihams also lived in Osama's Abbotabad bungalow
 shaayad teenon main banati nahin thi or kya pataa inaki nafrat se nikali mukhabiri ne osama ko maut kaa shikaar bana diya
 There is news about Osama that the wife to whom
 
 What he wanted most was the infidelity of his wife
 
 He did all his work
 lekin sawaal uthta he ki kya osama
 
 dil se apni biviyon ko pyaar karata tha
 Or that
 
 He had just a toy to play for
 ek akhbaar main chhapi uski vasiyat bataati he ki apni biviyon ko
 
 kya samajhataa tha osama
 Osama bin Laden himself performed five marriages but wanted his wives to never marry another man
 osama ke marane ke kuch dinon baad hi kuwait ke ek akhbaar main khabar chhapi ki osama apni vasiyat apni maut se das saal pehle hi likh chukaa tha
 In that will, he ordered his wives to never marry again after his death
 kaha jaataa he ki apni aakhri or khud se 25 saal choti bivi amal ko wo dilojaan se chahta tha lekin amal se bhi usne jabaran hi shaadi kii thi
 When Osama's first wife did not like the color of Osama, she left and left
 duusari bivi ne to talaak hi le lee jabaki aakhri teen biviyaan uske saath rahati thim
 In fact, Osama never gave preference to his wives more than his shoes, he was never loyal to any of his wives but wanted his wives' loyalty to be affected
 internet par in dinon ke ek behad kute bachche kaa or bhi behad kute video viral ho rahaa he
 It shows the baby with two puppies of the dogs
 ye donon pille bachche se baar baar lipat rahe hai
 The child is laughing a lot

 jin teen muddon par focus rakhaa jayega vah he netritv, pradarshan or majboot sarkaar
 BJP sources say that the first focus will be on how no party has a stronger leader than Modi
 modi kii niyat, mehnat or faisla lene kii kshamta ko joardaar tareeke se logon ke saamne rakhaa jayega
 Effective and catchy slogans are being prepared to focus on these three points
 slogan ko chota rakhaa jayega
 The special thing is that the activists will be asked to be especially careful that during the promotion and discussion, the slogan should not be redundant in any way nor should it have a sound of arrogance

 aspx In Durg district of Chhattisgarh, police have arrested a young man for raping a four-year-old girl
 durg ke atirikt police adheekshak prashanth thakur ne bataaya ki police ne jile ke utai thana kshetra ke antargat ghupasidih gaanv main 19 varshiya yuvak narendra kumaar ko chaar saal kii bacchee ke saath balaatkaar karne ke aarope main giraftaar kiya he
 Thakur told that Narendra lives in the neighborhood of the girl child
 buudhvaar kii shaam jab bacchee ghar se baahar khel rahi thi tab narendra use apane saath fasal rakhane kii jagah (kothaar) main le gaya or kathith rup se balaatkaar kiya
 During this, Narendra also beat up the girl
 unhone bataaya ki ghatana ke dauraan gaanv kii kuch mahilaayein jab vahaan se gujri tab unhen bacchee kii aawaaj sunai di
 The women chased Narendra about a kilometer away and handed him over to the police
 police adhikari ne bataaya ki police ne bacchee ko aspataal main bhartee karaayaa he, jahaan uski haalat gambhir bani hui he
 Here, after the news of the rape of the girl in the district, the local MLA and other activists of the opposition party Congress laid siege to the District Collector office and demanded the hanging of the accused
 gujarat chunaav prachaar ke dauraan bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha tha ki bhaajapa gujarat main 150 se zyada siton par jeet hasil karegi
 The belief in Modi Magic was behind this belief
 2014 ke baad punjab, bihar or dilli ko chhodkar saare chunaav main modi magic kaa jalawaa rahaa
 Especially in Uttar Pradesh, Modi rose above the head of Magic voters
 haalanki gujarat chunaav ke nateezon ne bijepi ko pradesh kaa sardaar jarur bana diya hoga, lekin iske liye unhen sangharsh karnaa padaa
 In such a situation, questions are being raised as to how long will the BJP continue to win with the help of Modi magic? BJP was reduced to 100 but in 2012 Gujarat got 115 seats, BJP got 47 seats
 9 fisadi vot mili the
 Congress won 61 seats in 2012, Congress 38
 9 fisadi mat mili the
 At the same time, according to the trends so far, BJP is seen getting around 100 seats and 49 percent votes
 vahiin congress ke vot share or siton donon main ijapha hua he
 The Congress is seen getting around 80 seats and 43 percent votes
 vahiin 2014 se tulana karen to 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main mat pratishat kii baat karen to bijepi ko gujarat main 60
 If you get 1 per cent votes, then according to the Assembly, 162 seats and Congress 33
 5 fisadi vot, siton ke hisaab se 17 siten mili thim
 In such a situation, the results of the Gujarat elections proved the claim of 150 seats of BJP President Amit Shah and other leaders to be false
 vahiin bijepi pichley chunaavon kaa pradarshan tak bhi nahin pahunch pai
 In such a situation, one can say that once the BJP has won with the help of Modi magic, it is difficult to say how long it will continue
 modi kii dhuandhar reliyangujrat ke chunaav prachaar main bijepi or piem narendra khud ne kaaphi takat jhonk di thi
 PM Modi was suspected to be upset in the Gujarat elections
 yahi vajah he ki unhen khud kaman sambhaal kar chunaav ke dauraan reliyaan kerani padi
 This is the reason why PM Modi's hard work paid off and finally BJP managed to get a few seats more than majority
 tamaam kendriya mantri chunaav prachaar menmodi magic par shaayad piem modi ko khud yakin nahin tha
 This is the reason why he had also put his entire cabinet with him in the Gujarat election campaign
 yahi nahin modi ne gujarat main uttar pradesh ke siem yogi adityanath bhi puraa sahyog liya
 All the ministers and Chief Minister Milkar also could not repeat the charisma of 2014 and the UP elections in Gujarat
 antim samay main imotional card (manishankar kaa bayaan)gujarat main satta main rahete hue bhi sangharsh karti bijepi ko aakhrismay main congress netaa manishankar ke vivadaspad bayaan se sanjivani booti mil gai
 Modi cashed Manishankar's statement and made a very emotional statement connecting it to the people of Gujarat
 aise main nateezon main modi magic ko chhodkar modi ke bhaavnaatmak bayanon kaa asar zyada dikh rahaa he
 Now it is the turn of elections in Rajasthan
 aise main dekhnaa he ki kya bijepi vahaan sarkaar barkaraar rakh paaegi? gujarat ko dekhte hue yah jarur saaf ho gaya he ki bijepi ke liye raah aasaan nahin hogi

 The Prime Minister said that 'I remember, even before 2014, there used to be discussion in the studio that Modi does not understand what is going on in the world, so what will happen to our foreign policy? But you must have seen in the events of the past, what is the impact of India's foreign policy today
 ' unhone yah bhi kaha ki ve dilli ko jaanate nahin the lekin 2014 main yahi baat unke liye vardaan sabit hua
 The Prime Minister said that today's new India is fearless, fearless and decisive
 aaj sarkaar sava sau karod bharatiyon ke purusharth, vishwaas ke saath aage bad rahi he
 This solidarity of Indians has created a fear among some anti-nationals within and outside the country
 main yahi kahuunga ki ye dar acha he
 When there is a fear of India's might in the enemy, this fear is good
 jab aatank ke aakaaon main sainikon ke shaury kaa dar ho, to ye dar acha he
 When the fugitives also fear to seize the law and their property, this fear is good
 'pradhanmantri ne kaha ki 'jab mamaa ke bolne se bade-bade parivaar baukhala jaaen, to ye dar acha he
 When the corrupt leaders also fear to go to jail, this fear is good
 jab bhrashtachariyon main bhi kanoon kaa dar ho, to ye dar acha he

 'dekhen piem modi kaa puraa bhaashanunhone aage kaha, rafel kii kami aaj desh ne mahasoos kii he
 Today, India is saying in one voice that if we had Rafael, what would happen? The country has suffered a lot due to its selfishness on Rafale and now due to politics
 pradhanmantri ne yah bhi kaha ki modi virodh karnaa ho to jarur kariye, hamaari yojanaon main kamiyaan nikaaliye, aapkaa hameshaa swaagat he, lekin desh ke suraksha hiton kaa, desh ke hit kaa virodh mat kariye
 You should keep in mind that terrorists like Masood Azhar and Hafiz Saeed, the leaders of terror, do not get support in this insistence of Modi opposition

 It is their nature that they do not respect any institution in India

 In response to a question, Rahul said that i am not a casteist, do not believe in untouchability
 rajyapal vajubhai vaala istipha dete hai yaa nahin, ek alag mudda he, lekin desh kii sanvaidhanik sansthaaon par lagaataar hamale ho rahe hai
 If you change one, the other one does the same after it arrives

 The Ghazal Emperor Jagjit Singh, who settled in the hearts of listeners with his eyes, paper kayak, and how many songs he had, made a new life in this faded genre of music in the 70s and made a different identity in Bollywood
 unki aawaaj kaa dard tanha dilon kaa dard mitaatha
 This life is someone else, someone else in my name, touch me with your lips, he made his mark in the 70s by singing hit ghazals like 'hum Rukh Hum Ruk Hum, Thousand Times Chale' yah vah daur tha, jab ghazal ke aasmaan par noorjahan, mallika pukhraj, begum akhtar, talat mahmud or menhadi hasan jaise sthapit naam the
 The inspiration behind the voice behind those timeless ghazals were KL Sehgal, Talat Mahmood, Abdul Karim Khan, Bade Ghulam Ali Khan and Aamir Khan
 apane samay ke sabase safal or chahete gayakon main se ek jagajeet ne apane paanch dashak ke kariyar main dheron geet or gajalen gaain

 baad main sainiya gharaane ke ustad jamaal khan se unhone chah saal sangeet kii talim lee or khyal, thumari or dhrupad kaa gyaan paaya
 Jagjit believed that music is an object of inspiration, not competition
 unka kahana tha, jaise hi aap sangeet main pratiyogita laate hai, uski aatma mar jaati he
 He had said, music is a broad subject
 sangeet main ganit or vyakaran hota he
 Until a person knows everything, he cannot become a good singer
 ghazal gane se pehle vyakti ko 15 saalon tak sangeet siikhnaa chahie
 In his most memorable songs, you are smiling so much, where you are on your own journey of your choice, everything was your first, but now it seems we were in another house in our own house
 unka aakhri concert 23 sitambar ko mattunga ke shanmukhanand haul main gulam ali ke saath hona tha, lekin usee din vah biimaar pad gaye
 a few days ago both artists performed in Delhi
 unhone gurudwaron main bhajan gaakar apane sangeet ke safar kii shuruyaat kii
 His throat spell waived his fees at DAV College, Jalandhar
 akashwani, jalandhar main unhen vyavsaayik taur par gane kaa mauka mila, jahaan unhen kam paison par saal main chah sidhe prasaaran kaa prastaav diya gaya
 But, the success was like a dream
 parshv gayikee main apane sapane ko talashne vah 1961 main mayanagari mumbai pahunche, lekin asafal prayaason ne unhen waapas jalandhar pahunchaa diya
 Ghazal Samrat again arrived in the city of dreams in 1965 and this time HMV recorded his two ghazals
 isi vakt unhone apane kesh katwane or pagadi ko hataane kaa faisla kiya
 However, Jagjit Singh's struggle in playback singing continued and he made short sweet songs for advertising films and documentaries to earn money
 aisi hi ek recording ke vakt unki mulaakaat chitra se hui or 1970 main donon parinay sutara main bandha gaye, joki unki jindagi kaa terning pyant sabit hua
 The fading of Ghazal singing in Bollywood led to Jagjit's golden career
 1975 main echemavi ne jagajeet ko unke pehle album da anforgatables kaa prastaav diya, jisamen jagajeet-chitra kii gajalen thim
 Jagjit is also credited for bringing modern instruments with traditional sarangi and tabla to ghazal singing
