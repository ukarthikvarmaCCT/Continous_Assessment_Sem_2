 kisi priyajan se uphaar praapt karnaa nishchit rup se khushi laa saktaa he lekin kai uphaar aapaki kar dendaree badha sakate hai
 Not all gifts are tax deductible
 taxman ke dijiem naveen vadhava kehete hai, ''yadi ek varsh ke dauraan praapt uphaar 50,000 rupye kii seemaa se adhik he, to atirikt raashi ko 'anya sroton se aay' ke tahat kul aay main shaamil kiya janaa he
 This income is normally taxed at the applicable slab rates
 '' yah yaad rakhana mahatvapurn he ki yah agar kul praapt raashi par lagu hota he—yadi kisi vittiya varsh ke dauraan praapt uphaaron kii kul raashi 50,000 rupye kii seemaa se adhik he, to yah atirikt raashi kar mukt nahin he
 However, not all gifts are taxable in this manner
 uphaar jo kar ke daayre se hai baharkuch vishesh avasar udhaaharan ke liye shaadi ko le len, jisamen praapt uphaar ko gaiyr-kar yogya mana jaataa he
 Similarly, any amount received through a will or by way of inheritance is exempt from tax
 iske atirikt, koi vyakti jo khud ko mrityu ke kagaar par pahunchaa mahasoos karata he or apni sampatti kaa nipataara kisi ko upharswaroop bhent karke karata he—use bhi karon se chhot di jaati he
 Apart from these cases, gifts received from local authorities are also exempt
 vadhava kehete hai, ''kisi fund, santhaan, vishvavidhyalay, aspataal yaa anya chikitsa santhaan se praapt raashi yaa dhara 10 ee (23si) main ullikhit koi trust yaa santhaan, yaa dhara 12 ee ke tahat panjikrut trust se praapt raashi ko kar se chhot praapt he
 "when are the gifts received in kinship? Tax-free tax-related complications that matter the most are gifts received from close relatives because they are often of a large amount
" kuch 'kareebi rishtedaaron' se mili uphaaron ko puri tarah se chhot di gai he—in rishtedaaron main mata-pita, bachche, bhai-bahan or pati-patni ke mata-pita or bhai-bahan shaamil hai
 It also includes the spouse of a close relative
 in rishtedaaron se alag rishtedaaron se praapt uphaar ko kar se chhot nahin milti—udhaaharan ke liye, chachere bhai se praapt uphaar kar chhot ke tahat nahin aata
 It is also important to note that the income earned from gifts received is not tax free
 cleartax ke sansthaapak or siio archit gupta, kehete hai, ''agar aap uphaar se koi aay praapt karte hai—jaise ki byaaj, yaa nivesh se praapt anya laabh, to aapako apane kar ritern main is tarah kii aay ko 'anya sroton se aay' ke rup main darshana hoga or lagu kar slab ke anusaar kar kaa bhugtan karnaa hoga
 "when and how to give gift information if your income is above the original exemption limit - 2 for people under 60"
 5 lakh rupye—to iskar ritern daakhil karnaa anivaary he
 Therefore, gifts must be declared as part of your income, even if it comes under the exemption limit
 However, it may not be mandatory if your income is below the original exemption limit
 vadhava kehete hai, ''agar nirdhaariti (assesi) ko kar ritern daakhil karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he, to pichley varsh ke dauraan praapt uphaaron ke vivaran prastut karne kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin he
 However, even if it is not mandatory, it would be better to disclose it
 gupta kehete hai, ''aapako apana kar ritern daakhil karte samay uphaaron ke mulya kaa khulaasa karnaa chahie
 In case of taxable gift, the amount is to be mentioned under 'other Sources'
 uphaaron ko iskar ritern main 'chhot vaali aay' ke rup main prakat kiya janaa chahie
 "this will ensure that you have an official record of all the gifts received, which if investigated by the tax authorities can help you a lot

 Team India, led by confident Virat Kohli, will take on India (australia vs Australia) in the third and deciding ODI (3rd ODI) match against Australia on Friday
 donon timen is samay siries main 1-1 kii barabari par hai, aise main jo bhi team melbern (melbourne ODI) main hone vaale is match main fatah hasil karegi, siries par uskaa kabja ho jayega
 By the way, the Indian team will not want to let another chance to create history by winning this match
 uskaa iraadaa test siries ke baad simit overon main bhi australia ke khilaaf usee ke desh main pehali vanade siries (dwipaksheeya) jeet darj karne kaa hoga
 The Indian team has never won a bilateral ODI series on Australian soil
 is praaroop main usne australia main 1985 main world championships of cricket championships ore 2008 main sibi siries jiti thi
 The last time India beat Australia 4–1 in the ODI series was in 2016
 duusari ore, yadi australia team teesraa vanade match jeetne main safal rahi to lagbhag do saal main yah uski pehali vanade siries jeet hogi
 Ind Vs Aus: Australia's playing XI declared for the third ODI, these two players were included If India wins the third ODI in Melbourne, then they will conclude the Australia tour without losing any series on the 2018-19 tour
 donon deshon kii tii20 siries 1-1 se baraabar rahi jabaki test siries main team india ne 2-1 se aitihaasik jeet darj kii thi
 India's only worry would be the fifth bowling option
 vanade siries main abhi tak tej gendbaaj bhubaneshwar kumaar or mohammad shami prabhavi rahe hai jabaki spinner kuldeep yadav or rabindra jadeja ne bich ke overon main morcha sambhala
 In the absence of all-rounder Hardik Pandya, India tried fast bowlers Khalil Ahmed and Mohammed Siraj as fifth option in Sydney and Adelaide, scoring 55 and 76 runs respectively
 paanchaven gendbaaj ke rup main harfanmaulaa vijay shankar or leg spinner yujavendra chahal vikalp ho sakate hai
 Both of them practiced fiercely on MCG
 shankar ek atirikt ballebaaj kii kami bhi puri karenge lekin dekhnaa yah he ki vanade cricket main padaarpan ke saath kya team prabandhan unhen puure 10 over dene kaa bharosa kar saktaa he
 Siraj failed and captain Virat Kohli was confused as to whether to bowl the last three overs of the spell
 khalil ahamed kii harakat par MS dhoni ko aayaa gussa, yun lagaai fatkaar, videobarawa agar do tej gendbaajon or teen spinneron ko lekar utarataa he to chahal vikalp ho sakate hai
 On the other hand, playing by Shankar will change the batting order and could make room for Kedar Jadhav
 aise main paanchaven gendbaaj ke das over jadhav or shankar milakar kar sakate hai
 Ambati Rayudu will probably have to stay out in this situation
 unhone guuruuvaar ko haalanki vaikalpik abhyaas satr main shankar, chahal, jadhav, mahendra singh dhoni or shikhar dhawan ke saath bhaag liya

 When you start something honestly, then you start seeing all the problems behind and every solution standing in front of itself

 According to the information, a person's minor girl studies in the 10th grade in a school in the village
 vahaan ek naaballig se uskaa prem-prasang tha
 The young man gave the girl a mobile phone, after which they started talking often
 isi dauraan usne ladki ko ghar se bhagane kii yojana banaai
 At the same time, the girl's father came to know about both the affair and the plan

 Shortly after the incident, his family took him to the hospital, where he died on Wednesday during treatment

 Amid the ongoing tussle in the party, the Aam Aadmi Party government led by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has completed 49 days
 apane pehle kaarykaal main AAP kii sarkaar 49 dinon tak hi chali thi
 In the second term, the government is looking very different from last time
 'lokapal' ke mudde par istipha dene vaali sarkaar is baar 'lokapal' or 'swaraj bill' par sust nazar aa rahi he
 The government, which was seen in the 'action against Corruption' in the first term, has not taken any special initiative to stop corruption this time
 party ke bheetar chal rahi khinchataan se bhi sarkaar kii chhavi karaab hui he
 However, during this period, the Kejriwal government has taken several other decisions including giving electricity at half the rate in the public interest, giving 20,000 liters of free water every month and setting up of the Delhi Dialogue Commission
 i-rashan card kii shuruyaat, duty ke dauraan dilli police, paara military force yaa dilli sarkaar ke karmchaariyon kii maut par 1 karod rupee ke muaavze kaa elaan bhi sarkaar ne kiya he
 Some speakers would speak on Rohit Vemula and some on JNU
 koi shuru main rohit par bolta to bich main jeenyu par or aakhir main rashtrawaad par
 Till you form an opinion on Rohit Vemula, the second speaker would rise up and take the debate towards nationalism and terrorism on the pretext of JNU
 laga ki vichaaron or bhaashanon kaa jhula jhul rahe hai
 It would have been better if the debate was either entirely on JNU or on Rohit Vemula
 samajhnaa mushkil tha ki rashtrawaad kii bahes main rohit vemula kaise feet ho rahaa he yaa rohit vemula kii bahes main rashtrawaad yaa jeenyu kaise feet ho rahaa he
 From time to time, the issue of government intervention in the institutions was being confused further
 main loksabhaa main shuru hui charchaa kii baat kar rahaa hum
 The speaker was more interested in targeting the main competitors of his area
 tiares ke saansad ko hyderabad uniwarsity main vemula kii aatmahatya ke baad netaaon kaa janaa raajnneetik paryaton nazar aayaa to trinmul ke saansad ne vemula or jeenyu par bolte bolte sipiem ko nishaanaa bananaa nahin choda
 This was the quality of this debate and this quality became easy for the government

 When the speaker was speaking in Hindi, his tone seemed upbeat and dramatic

 When the first two speakers, Saugata Roy and Tathagata Satthapati, started speaking in English, it seemed that a professor had come to the house and the students were silent because they had not come

 ab main aaj do dalit netaaon kaa zikr karnaa chaahunga
 One is related to the Lok Sabha debate and the other is to the Rajya Sabha, but Rohit is relevant due to his association with Vemula
 pehle lokjanshkti party ke netaa chiraag paswan kii baat karnaa chahta hum jo rohit vemula par bolne ke liye uthe
 Chirag said that no one can justify whatever happened to Rohit Vemula
 kya koi unki maa kaa dard kam kar saktaa he
 Had the issue been handled seriously, Chirag Paswan also praised the central government, saying that the result would have been different had the government done a good job by announcing the inquiry immediately
 ab unki baat se saaf nahin ho sakaa ki ve sarkaar se jawaab maang rahe hai yaa use certificate de rahe hai
 Chirag mentioned twice that he is distressed and amazed by this turn of the society's thought journey
 unki baton se laga ki desh kii dalit raajnneeti badal rahi he yaa phir dalit rajaneta badal rahe hai
 Chirag was talking to the land from where he now wants to rise above the caste and religion area and see the issues
 jis rohit vemula ke mudde ko ambedkarwaadi chaatr dalit mudda banaakar aage badha rahe the, chiraag unke asar main nahin aae
 In this case, i found Chirag's speech bold
 vaise chiraag kaa suut mujhe pasand aayaa
 Also a tie knot
 dhyaan kabhi unki baat par ja rahaa tha to kabhi unke suut par
 If this was the issue twenty years ago, how would his father Ram Vilas Paswan speak
 ve aakraamak hote yaa chiraag kii tarah aadhyatmik
 But doesn't Chirag have the right to look at the same questions afresh, independent of his father
 kya dekha hi nahin janaa chahie
 How can this happen? chiraag ne bhale apane pita kii tarah sangharsh nahin kiya ho lekin mayawati to sangharsh kii raajnneeti se ai hai
 In the Rajya Sabha, Mayawati asked Union Minister Smriti Irani why there is not a single Dalit in the committee investigating the Rohit Vemula case
 shuru main mayawati ne aakraamakata dikhaai to jawaab main smriti irani jis tarah se haaavee huin wo sadan ke bheetar mayawati ke saath shaayad hi kabhi hua hoga
 There have been political attacks on Mayawati, but the opponents of the attack also used to take care that Dalit voters standing behind Mayawati should not be hurt
 mayawati ko bhi dalit netaa hone kaa laabh miltaa rahaa he lekin smriti irani ne vinamrata se jawaab dene ke anurodh ke saath jis aakraamak tevar se jawaab diya usase mayawati bhi stabdh rah gayi
 There was anger on Smriti Irani's face and the answer was clearly that if Mayawati ji wants an answer from me, i am ready to answer
 basapa ke har netaa or kaaryakarta se kahati hum ki sar kalam kar aapke charnon main rakh duungi agar mere jawaab se santusht na hon
 i have read only part of Irani's statement for you, but his anger also frees BJP from the compulsion that it will not come down with these discussions in UP elections that bsp's help will be taken to form government if needed
 Will support BSP
 vaise bhi bijepi ne loksabhaa chunaav main bispi ko zero par pahunchaa diya tha
 Smriti Irani said that a citizen is a Dalit only if Mayawati will certify
 wo is par bahes ke liye taiyaar hai
 The kind of aggression, sentimentalism and fearlessness in the speeches of the Opposition was not seen in the speeches of Pappu Yadav, suspended from the RJD and Jayaprakash Yadav, RJD MP
 unke bhaashanon main ye aayaa ki kanhaiya bihar kaa betaa he
 The rest of the accused, where Jahan has sons, could not muster the courage to say that their leader was the son of Bihar

 BJP leader Afzal remained on the Guru and surrounded the opposition

 Whether a new thing happened or the formality of saying the same things on record was completed

 Now i would like to mention two Dalit leaders today
 ek kaa sambandh loksabhaa kii bahes se he or duusare kaa sambandh rajyasabha se he, magar rohit vemula se jude hone ke kaaran praasangik he
 First i want to talk about Lok Janshakti Party leader Chirag Paswan who rose to speak on Rohit Vemula
 chiraag ne kaha ki rohit vemula ke saath jo kuch bhi hua use koi sahi nahin tehra saktaa
 Can anyone ease their mother's pain
 agar is mudde ko gambhirtha se handle kiya jaataa to aaj nateeja kuch or hota yah kehete hue chiraag paswan ne centre sarkaar kii tarif bhi kar di ki sarkaar ne turant jaanch kii ghoshnaa kar acha kaam kiya
 Now it could not be clear from their point that they are seeking an answer from the government or giving a certificate to it
 chiraag ne ek do baar zikr kiya ki ve samaaj kii vichaar yatra ke is mode se vyathit or chakit hai
 His talk felt that the country's Dalit politics is changing or Dalit politicians are changing
 chiraag us zamin se baat kar rahe the jahaan se ab ve jaat paat dharm kshetra se upar uthakar masalon ko dekhnaa chaahate hai
 The Rohit Vemula issue, which Ambedkarite students were pursuing by making it a Dalit issue, did not impress Chirag
 is maamle main mujhe chiraag kaa bhaashan saahasik laga
 By the way i liked Chirag's suit
 taai kaa note bhi
 Attention was sometimes going to his talk and sometimes to his suit
 bees saal pehle agar yahi mudda hota to unke pita ramvilas paswan kaise bolte
 They were aggressive or spiritual like a lamp
 lekin kya chiraag ko apane pita se swatantra hokar unheen sawaalon ko nae sire se dekhne kaa haq nahin he
 What should not be seen aise kaise ho saktaa he
 Chirag may not have fought like his father, but Mayawati has come from the politics of struggle
 rajyasabha main mayawati ne kendriya mantri smriti irani se poocha ki rohit vemula maamle kii jaanch kii cameti main ek bhi dalit kyon nahin he
 Initially, Mayawati showed aggression, then in response, the way Smriti Irani dominated, she would have rarely happened to Mayawati within the House
 mayawati par raajnneetik hamale hue hai magar hamalaa karte virdohi bhi khyaal rakhte the ki kahin mayawati ke peeche khadaa dalit matadaata aahat na ho jaae
 Mayawati has also had the benefit of being a Dalit leader, but Smriti Irani was stunned by the aggressive attitude with which she responded with a request to respond politely
 smriti irani ke chehre par gussa tha or jawaab saaf saaf ki mayawati ji mujhase jawaab chaahati hai to jawaab dene ke liye taiyaar hum
 i tell every BSP leader and worker that i will put my head in your feet if i am not satisfied with my answer
 maine aapke liye irani ke bayaan kaa kuch hi hissaa padhaa he lekin unka gussa bijepi ko is majaburi se bhi mukt karata he ki wo upi chunaav main in charchaaon ke saath ab nahin utregi ki zarurat padi to sarkaar banane ke liye bispi kii madad lee jaaegi yaa bispi ko samarthan degi
 Anyway, the BJP had pushed the BSP to zero in the Lok Sabha elections
 smriti irani ne kaha ki koi naagarik tabhi dalit he jise mayawati pramanit karengi
 They are ready to debate on this
 vipaksh ke bhaashanon main jis tarah kii aakraamakata, bhavukta or nirbhikta argedy se nilambit pappu yadav or argedy ke saansad jaiprakash yadav ke bhaashanon main thi, utani congress or vipaksh ke anya netaaon main nazar nahin ai
 It was in his speeches that Kanhaiya is the son of Bihar
 baaki aaropee jahaan ke bete hai unke netaa bihar kaa betaa jaisaa kehane kii himmat nahin juta paae
 The question is how the opposition in the Lok Sabha faced the question of Afzal Guru and Kashmir
 bharat virdohi naaron kii ninda to sabane kii lekin afzal guru par vipaksh kii taraf se kisi ne apni taraf se paksh nahin rakhaa
 They either survived or remained here and there
 bijepi ke netaa afzal guru par tike rahe or vipaksh ko gherte rahe
 The two leaders attempted to confront the question of Afzal Guru
 tirupati se wiesar ke saansad reddy ne kaha ki jab jeenyu ke chaatr jammu kashmir se sahanubhuti main poster lagaate hai, afzal guru ke samarthan main nahin
 You go into history aap baar baar unhen dhokhaa dete hai
 You said about the referendum, did not
 vishvavidhyalay main kuch baaten kahi jaati hai
 Students have rights but why does the government respond
 ab ye paryaapt daleel thi yaa nahin aap tay karen
 From Hyderabad, Asaduddin Owaisi looked a bit more assertive
 ovaisi ne kaha ki 1984 main punjab ke mukhyamantri ne samvidhan jalaayaa, aap unki tarif kar rahe hai
 You are talking about Afzal
 jo naare jeenyu main lage main use nahin maanata
 But slogans are raised daily in Srinagar
 kya puure srinagar ko band kar denge
 Why are you praising the PDP? kahaan gaya aapkaa deshprem
 When the PDP called Afzal Guru a martyr
 ovaisi ne congress kii bhi aalochana kii
 If the PDP had spoken on Afzal Guru's question, something would have been clear
 is bahes main pidipi ne hissaa hi nahin liya
 Rahul Gandhi had said on Wednesday morning that the BJP would not let him speak but he did not speak
 unka na bolnaa bhi ek sawaal kii tarah gunj rahaa he
 The comments vaise aaj kii prastaavna smriti irani ke bhaashan par hi honi chahie thi jo unhone loksabhaa main diya
 Apart from aggressiveness, sentimentalism, theatricality, she came all prepared according to her calculations
 unka jawaab tab tak sab par baari hi kaha jayega jab tak vipaksh kii taraf se koi binduvaar jawaab nahin detaa
 The opportunity has been lost in the Lok Sabha because the debate has been completed there
 apane bhaashanon main naatakeeyata or bhatakane kii chhot vipakshi netaaon ne bhi lee or smriti irani ne bhi lee
 Therefore, the opposition cannot complain about it
 bhaashanon ko sunakar laga ki vipakshi kheme main pratibhashali vaktaa or khaskar mehnatee vaktaaon kaa akaal he
 None of them gave an impressive speech like Smriti Irani
 grahamantri rajnath singh ne turant uthakar smriti irani kii zordaar prashansa kii
 The Home Minister said that there can be a debate on whether or not to be accused of treason, but the police investigation will be tested in the court
 sabko to nahin suna na jinako suna unki sari baton kaa yahaan zikr kar sakaa hum
 But whether the questions which were being raised outside also arose properly within the House, answers were sought and answers were given
 kya nai baat hui yaa unheen baton ko on ricard kehane kii aupchaarikta puri kii gai
 Who was escaping and who was asking in front or answering
 chiraag ne kaha ki rohit vemula ke saath jo kuch bhi hua use koi sahi nahin tehra saktaa
 Can anyone ease their mother's pain
 agar is mudde ko gambhirtha se handle kiya jaataa to aaj nateeja kuch or hota yah kehete hue chiraag paswan ne centre sarkaar kii tarif bhi kar di ki sarkaar ne turant jaanch kii ghoshnaa kar acha kaam kiya
 Now it could not be clear from their point that they are seeking an answer from the government or giving a certificate to it
 chiraag ne ek do baar zikr kiya ki ve samaaj kii vichaar yatra ke is mode se vyathit or chakit hai

 baaki aaropee jahaan ke bete hai unke netaa bihar kaa betaa jaisaa kehane kii himmat nahin juta paae
 The question is how the opposition in the Lok Sabha faced the question of Afzal Guru and Kashmir
 bharat virdohi naaron kii ninda to sabane kii lekin afzal guru par vipaksh kii taraf se kisi ne apni taraf se paksh nahin rakhaa
 They either survived or remained here and there
 bijepi ke netaa afzal guru par tike rahe or vipaksh ko gherte rahe
 The two leaders attempted to confront the question of Afzal Guru
 tirupati se wiesar ke saansad reddy ne kaha ki jab jeenyu ke chaatr jammu kashmir se sahanubhuti main poster lagaate hai, afzal guru ke samarthan main nahin
 You go into history aap baar baar unhen dhokhaa dete hai
 You said about the referendum, did not
 vishvavidhyalay main kuch baaten kahi jaati hai
 Students have rights but why does the government respond
 ab ye paryaapt daleel thi yaa nahin aap tay karen
 From Hyderabad, Asaduddin Owaisi looked a bit more assertive
 ovaisi ne kaha ki 1984 main punjab ke mukhyamantri ne samvidhan jalaayaa, aap unki tarif kar rahe hai
 You are talking about Afzal
 jo naare jeenyu main lage main use nahin maanata
 But slogans are raised daily in Srinagar
 kya puure srinagar ko band kar denge
 Why are you praising the PDP? kahaan gaya aapkaa deshprem
 When the PDP called Afzal Guru a martyr
 ovaisi ne congress kii bhi aalochana kii
 If the PDP had spoken on Afzal Guru's question, something would have been clear
 is bahes main pidipi ne hissaa hi nahin liya
 Rahul Gandhi had said on Wednesday morning that the BJP would not let him speak but he did not speak
 unka na bolnaa bhi ek sawaal kii tarah gunj rahaa he
 The comments vaise aaj kii prastaavna smriti irani ke bhaashan par hi honi chahie thi jo unhone loksabhaa main diya
 Apart from aggressiveness, sentimentalism, theatricality, she came all prepared according to her calculations
 unka jawaab tab tak sab par baari hi kaha jayega jab tak vipaksh kii taraf se koi binduvaar jawaab nahin detaa
 The opportunity has been lost in the Lok Sabha because the debate has been completed there
 apane bhaashanon main naatakeeyata or bhatakane kii chhot vipakshi netaaon ne bhi lee or smriti irani ne bhi lee
 Therefore, the opposition cannot complain about it
 bhaashanon ko sunakar laga ki vipakshi kheme main pratibhashali vaktaa or khaskar mehnatee vaktaaon kaa akaal he
 None of them gave an impressive speech like Smriti Irani
 grahamantri rajnath singh ne turant uthakar smriti irani kii zordaar prashansa kii
 The Home Minister said that there can be a debate on whether or not to be accused of treason, but the police investigation will be tested in the court
 sabko to nahin suna na jinako suna unki sari baton kaa yahaan zikr kar sakaa hum
 But whether the questions which were being raised outside also arose properly within the House, answers were sought and answers were given
 kya nai baat hui yaa unheen baton ko on ricard kehane kii aupchaarikta puri kii gai
 Who was escaping and who was asking in front or answering
 chiraag ne bhale apane pita kii tarah sangharsh nahin kiya ho lekin mayawati to sangharsh kii raajnneeti se ai hai
 In the Rajya Sabha, Mayawati asked Union Minister Smriti Irani why there is not a single Dalit in the committee investigating the Rohit Vemula case
 shuru main mayawati ne aakraamakata dikhaai to jawaab main smriti irani jis tarah se haaavee huin wo sadan ke bheetar mayawati ke saath shaayad hi kabhi hua hoga
 There have been political attacks on Mayawati, but the opponents of the attack also used to take care that Dalit voters standing behind Mayawati should not be hurt
 mayawati ko bhi dalit netaa hone kaa laabh miltaa rahaa he lekin smriti irani ne vinamrata se jawaab dene ke anurodh ke saath jis aakraamak tevar se jawaab diya usase mayawati bhi stabdh rah gayi
 There was anger on Smriti Irani's face and the answer was clearly that if Mayawati ji wants an answer from me, i am ready to answer
 basapa ke har netaa or kaaryakarta se kahati hum ki sar kalam kar aapke charnon main rakh duungi agar mere jawaab se santusht na hon
 i have read only part of Irani's statement for you, but his anger also frees BJP from the compulsion that it will not come down with these discussions in UP elections that bsp's help will be taken to form government if needed
 Will support BSP
 vaise bhi bijepi ne loksabhaa chunaav main bispi ko zero par pahunchaa diya tha
 Smriti Irani said that a citizen is a Dalit only if Mayawati will certify
 wo is par bahes ke liye taiyaar hai
 The kind of aggression, sentimentalism and fearlessness in the speeches of the Opposition was not seen in the speeches of Pappu Yadav, suspended from the RJD and Jayaprakash Yadav, RJD MP
 unke bhaashanon main ye aayaa ki kanhaiya bihar kaa betaa he
 The rest of the accused, where Jahan has sons, could not muster the courage to say that their leader was the son of Bihar
 sawaal he ki loksabhaa main vipaksh ne afzal guru or kashmir ke sawaal kaa kaise saamana kiya
 Everyone slammed the anti-india slogans, but no one from Afzal Guru put his side for opposition
 wo yaa to batch gaye yaa idhar udhar bolkar rah gaye
 BJP leader Afzal remained on the Guru and surrounded the opposition
 do netaaon ne afzal guru ke sawaal kaa saamana karne kaa prayaas kiya
 YSR MP Reddy from Tirupati said that when JNU students put up posters in sympathy with Jammu and Kashmir, not in support of Afzal Guru
 aap itihaas main jaaiye
 You cheat them again and again
 aapane janamatsangrah kii baat kahi thi, nahin kii
 Some things are said in the university
 chaatro ke adhikaar hai lekin sarkaar kyon pratikriya detii he
 Now whether or not this was enough argument, you decide
 hyderabad se hi asaduddin ovaisi thode adhik mukhar nazar aae
 Owaisi said that in 1984 the Chief Minister of Punjab burnt the constitution, you are praising him
 aap afzal kii baat kar rahe hai
 i do not believe the slogan of JNU
 lekin srinagar main rose jume ke din naare lagaaye jate hai
 Will you shut down the entire Srinagar
 pidipi kii tarif aap kyon kar rahe hai
 Where did your patriotism go? jab pidipi ne afzal guru ko shahid qaraar diya
 Owaisi also criticized the Congress
 afzal guru ke sawaal par pidipi bolti to kuch spasht hota
 PDP did not participate in this debate
 rahul gandhi ne buudhvaar subah kaha tha ki bijepi bolne nahin degi lekin wo to bole hi nahin
 Their refusal is also echoing like a question
 tippaniyan Today's introduction should have been on Smriti Irani's speech which she gave in the Lok Sabha
 aakraamakata, bhavukta, naatakeeyata ke alaava wo apane hisaab se puri taiyaari karke ain thim
 His answer will be called heavy on everyone until someone from the opposition gives a point-wise reply
 loksabhaa main to mauka chalaa gaya kyonki vahaan bahes puri ho gai he
 Dramatism and deviation in his speeches were taken by opposition leaders and Smriti Irani
 isliye vipaksh isaki shikaayat nahin kar saktaa
 Hearing the speeches, it was felt that there is a famine of talented speakers and especially hardworking speakers in the opposition camp
 unamem se koi bhi smriti irani ke jaisaa prabhaavshaalee bhaashan nahin de paaya
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh immediately got up and praised Smriti Irani
 grahamantri ne kaha ki deshadroh kaa aarope lage yaa na lage is par bahes ho sakati he magar police kii jaanch kii pariksha adaalat main ho jaaegi
 i have not heard everyone, nor have i been able to mention all the things that i heard here
 lekin kya jo sawaal baahar uth rahe the wo sadan ke bheetar bhi thik se uthe, jawaab maange gaye or jawaab die gaye
 Whether a new thing happened or the formality of saying the same things on record was completed
 koun bachakar nikal rahaa tha or koun saamne saamne se puch rahaa tha yaa jawaab de rahaa tha

 Lord you know my heart, i am untouchable, i have no right to come to the temple
 kintu devtaa yah na samajhnaa, tum par meraa pyaar nahin he
pyaar aseem, amit he, phir bhi paas tumhaare aa na sakungi
 It will not be able to reach its small worship steps, so in this darkness, i have been hiding
 tere charnon main kho jaaon, itnaa vyakul man laai hoon
tum dekho pahichaan sako to tum mere man ko pahichaano
 Even if the world does not understand, my lord! Know my mind, i also have my mind, i will give flowers to you, flowers
 or charan-raj lene ko main charnon ke neeche bich jaaon
mujhako bhi adhikaar mili vah, jo sabko adhikaar mila he
 May i find love, everyone! Your love has been found
 You Lord of all, say how is the discrimination in the temple? o my stone! Pasejo, why would you say this? I, Garibini, would somehow collect the items of worship
 badi saadh se tuje poojane, mandir ke dwaare tak aati
kah detaa he kintu pujari, yah tera bhagwaan nahin he
 Somewhere the temple is of untouchables and God is far away
 i listen, i am burning, this rebellious flame in my mind
 yah kathorta, ishwar ko bhi jisane took-took kar daalaa
yah nirmam samaaj kaa bandhan, or adhik ab sah na sakungi
 This false belief, reputation is false, i will not be able to live in it
 God also has two, believe me, my mind is not ready
 kintu devtaa yah na samajhnaa, tum par meraa pyaar nahin he
meraa bhi man he jisamen anuraag bharaa he, pyaar bharaa he
 It is full of affection and hospitality to go somewhere in the world, i have come to give you the same affection, hospitality, love today
 or itnaa tumse aashwaasan, mere prabhu! lene ai hoon
tum kah do, tumko unki in baton par vishwaas nahin he
 You do not have the distinction of untouchable, rich and poor
 rahul gandhi ne uttar pradesh main daliton ke ghar bhojan karke ek nayaa formula izaad kiya tha, haalanki is formule kaa asar upi ke vidhansabha chunaavon main congress ke paksh main dekhne ko nahin mila
 Now the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is also adopting this formula
 upi main party ke prabharee amit shah jhaansi pahunche or vahaan dalit ke ghar bhojan kiya
 Amit Shah, meanwhile, accused the SP government of the state of intimidating the administrative officials and intending to use them in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 shah ne kaha ki uttar pradesh kii akhilesh yadav sarkaar prashasnic adhikariyon ko bhaybheet karke unka upyog karke loksabhaa chunaav jeetna chaahati he, lekin use samajhnaa chahie ki chunaav janamat se jeeta jaataa he naa ki aatankit karke
 He said that the SP government is giving 20 percent reservation in various schemes to the Muslim class by robbing the rights of backward classes
 shah ne daawa kiya sapa sarkaar 21 aatankwaadiyon se mukademe waapas lenaa chaahati he
 He challenged SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav that BJP workers would not let him out of the house if even one of the terrorists was released
 uttar pradesh or uttarakhand ke purv mukhyamantri endi tiwari ke bete rohit shekhar kii hatya ke maamle main police ke haath ab tak khaali hai
 There are 3 more people in the police suspect radar
 shaq rohit kii patni, driver or naukar par he
 According to police sources, wife Apoorva is giving a very careful statement to the police
 police poochtacha main usne bataaya ki vah rohit shekhar ke kamare main gai thi
 The mystery of Rohit Shekhar's murder is constantly deepening
 unki patni kaa bayaan sawaalon ke ghere main he
 According to police sources, in the latest statement, his wife has admitted that she went to his room on the night of April 15-16
 lekin mahaj is vajah se kii vah unki patni he or pati-patni main jo rishte hote hai uske liye wo vahaan gai thi
 It is possible that something happened during this time that Rohit died
 lekin isse rohit kii maut ho sakati he aisa police ko lagata nahin
 However, the police believe that as a lawyer he knows what to speak and what not
 bataa den ki rohit us vakt behad nashe main tha
 In such a situation, the question arises that even if this happened, why did Apoorva not take her to the hospital immediately
 apurva kaa ye bhi kahana he ki rohit ko zyada samay tak sone kii beemaari thi
 In such a situation, he had little doubt that Rohit lying on the bed was dead
 isliye usne na use jagaane kii koshish kii or na hi unhen doctor ke paas le jane kii
 According to police, Rohit was in the first floor room of the house
 uske bagal vaale kamare main patni apurva, saamne vaale kamare main driver akhilesh or uske upar duusari manzil par naukar bholu tha, police ko shaq inhen teen logon par he
 The police has given a clean chit to almost all the other people in the house
 police ke mutabik sisitivi jaanch se pataa chalaa ki pehali manzil par in teen logon ke alaava na koi aayaa na koi gaya
 Police say the driver and servant will be involved in the murder, no reason has been found so far
 apurva supreme court main vakil hai isliye unhen hatya karne kaa anjaam bhi pataa hoga
 The murder may have been done under some charge
 police ke mutabik ab tak yah maamla sajeesh ke tahat kii gai hatya kaa nahin lagata
 However, the police are also awaiting a forensic report to prove who was in Shekhar's room that night
 kyonki police ko rohit ke saath hathapayee ke saboot bhi nahin mili hai
 The CCTV investigation revealed that that night Rohit, then driver Akhilesh, then servant Bholu and then Apurva went to the first floor
 apurva ne agle din kareeb 3 baje naukar bholu se rohit kaa states check karne ke liye bhi kaha
 Apoorva also claimed that Rohit had insomnia
 isliye 16 ghante tak use kisi ne nahin jagaaya

 Gauhar looked at Tanuji seated in the audience

 gauhar ne bataaya ki main yah maan chuki thi ki tanisha hi vinar hongi

 kuch vakt laga is ehsaas ko bheetar bharne main ki main jeet gai
 There were many good contestants this year, Kamya Punjabi, Shilpa Sakalani, Andy, Kushal Tandon
 big bos ke ghar main 104 din rahane or trophy jeetne ke baad gauhar ko 50 lakh rupee kii inami rakam mili he
 Referring to his closeness with Kushal Kushal who came close due to Armaan, Gauhar Khan said that all this happened due to Armaan Kohli
 gauhar ne bataaya ki sho ke pehle hafte main hi kushal ne mujhase kaha ki unhen armaan kaa mere saath vyavhaar pasand nahin aayaa
 i liked that someone is standing with me on this issue

 District Judge SK Sarwaria accepted the application of the Special Public Prosecutor, saying that the chargesheet prepared against Kumar in 1992 cannot be clubbed with another case on which the trial is already on

 Attributing CM Kejriwal and Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung to the Delhi 'crisis', the Congress on Friday said that both had 'crossed their boundaries' and 'did not follow the prescribed rules of governance'
 congress saansad piel puniya ne kaha, ‘shashan bahut hisamvedansheel muddahai, log nahin jaanate hai ki koun faisle karata he kyonki yah ek cheharaavihin cheez he, lekin durbhaagya sejang or kejarivaljo khud naukarshahi kii prishthbhumi se aate hai, ne shashan ke nirdhaarit niyamon kaa paalan nahin kiya or maamla sadak par laa rahe hai
 He said that the Lieutenant Governor and the Chief Minister had violated their limits
 bijepi par bhi bolaa hamalapuniya ne kaha, ‘sankat ke liye ve donon jimmedaar hai kyonki unhone apni simaaon ko laangha he

 The battle between the Delhi government and the central government over the dominance of Delhi is well known
 donon kii is jang kaa khamiyaja hameshaa janata ko bhugatna padataa he
 In 2016, when the High Court gave its verdict in this matter, the Center said that 'this is our victory'
 ab supreme court ke faisle ko dilli sarkaar (kejariwal sarkaar) apni jeet bataa rahi he
 Soon after the SC decision, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal called it a victory for the people of Delhi, and thanked the Supreme Court
 jabakiupamukhyamantri manish sisodiyane faisle ko aitihaasik qaraar diya, unhone kaha ki ab sarkaar apana kaam kar sakegi
 Whereas BJP and Congress say that the Supreme Court has not said anything new in its decision
 court ne keval samvidhan main jo baaten hai use doharaaya he or isamen dilli sarkaar kii jeet jaisi koi baat nahin he
 Actually, the Delhi government and the central government are capitalizing on the Supreme Court's decision in their own way
 aise main court kii wo tippanee or faisle kii ahm baaten janata tak donon paksh apane tareeke se pahunchane main lage hai
 But we tell you, who got what from the Supreme Court's decision and for whom it proved to be a shock and whose side was rightly strengthened? The Supreme Court said in its judgment that the elected government of Delhi was the only one to run the state
 Is responsible for justise chandrachud ne kaha ki matbhedon ke bich bhi rajanetaaon or adhikariyon ko miljul kar kaam karnaa chahie
 The real power and responsibility is that of the elected government
 supreme court ke faisle se adhikariyon ke tabadale kaa haq ab kejariwal sarkaar ke paas aa gaya he, jo badi jeet he
 The Supreme Court in its judgment against the Delhi government first said that Delhi cannot get full statehood
 isse itar sabhi maamalon main chuni hui sarkaar kanoon bana sakati he
 Justice Chandrachud said that the nation fails when the democratic institutions of the country are closed
 court ne kaha ki up-rajyapal koswatantra adhikaranheen saunpe gaye hai
 In the case of police, law and order and land, all officers will remain with LG
 yani kejariwal sarkaar kii ye maangen thukraa di gayi
 All the officers will remain with LG in the matter of Police, Law and Order and Land in Delhi in favor of the SC
 isse itar sabhi maamalon main chuni hui sarkaar kanoon bana sakati he
 The Supreme Court bench has said that lg's job is to take care of the national interest
 court ne kaha ki mantriparishad ke sabhi faislon se up-rajyapal ko nishchit rup se avgat karaayaa janaa chahie, lekin iskaa yah matlab nahin he ki isamen up-rajyapal kii sahmati aavashyak he
 The Center has been told by the Supreme Court that the Lieutenant Governor is not free to take a decision in Delhi, LG will have to act only as per the advice of the Cabinet
 uparajyapal mantrimandal ke faislon ko lataka kar nahin rakh sakate hai
 They should keep in mind that the elected government has the consent of the people
 SC ne bataai uparajyapal kii bhoomikasupreme court kii ore se kaha gaya he ki uparajyapal ko sirf cabinet kii salaah par hi faisla karnaa chahie anyathaa maamla raashtrapati ke paas bhej dena chahie
 Justice Chandrachud has said that lg's job is not to restrain every decision of the Delhi government, nor does every decision of the Council of Ministers need lg's approval
 faisle kii badi batensupreme court ne apane faisle main kuch aisi baaten kahin, jise donon pakshon ko samajhane kii jarurat he
 Chief Justice Deepak Mishra commented that the Lieutenant Governor should work closely with the Delhi government
 dilli main kisi tarah kii araajaktaa kii koi jagah nahin he, sarkaar or alji ko saath main kaam karnaa chahie
 The situation in Delhi is different from the rest of the Union Territories and full states, so everyone should work together
 chif justise deepak mishra ne tippanee karte hue kaha ki samvidhan kaa paalan sabhi kii duty he, samvidhan ke mutabik hi prashasnic faisle lenaa samuhik duty he
 The SC said that there should be cordial relations between the Center and the state as well
 rajyon ko rajya or samavarti suchi ke tahat sanvaidhanik adhikaar kaa istemaal karne kaa haq he
 Significantly, this big decision regarding Delhi has been given by the Constitution Bench of five judges, which included Justice AK Sikri, Justice AM Khanwilkar, Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice Ashok Bhushan along with Chief Justice Deepak Mishra
 captain amarinder singh kii cabinet se alag hone ke baad navjot singh siddhu ko dilli kii siyaasi pich par utaarne kii taiyaari ho rahi he
 It is believed that Delhi Congress can hand over the command of the state president to Sidhu
 ab sawaal uthta he ki kya siddhu punjab chhodkar dilli kii pich par kismat aajamaayenge? iske pehle unhone bijepi keval isi shart par chodi thi, kyonki vah punjab chhodkar baahar nahin janaa chaahate the
 Now the Congress is also placing the same condition in front of Sidhu on the lines of BJP
 bijepi kaa daaman chhodkar congress main entry karne ke baad se hi navjot singh siddhu punjab ke congressi netaaon kii ankhon main hameshaa hi khatkate rahe hai
 Due to this, Sidhu had to resign from the cabinet of Captain Amarinder Singh government of Punjab
 punjab cabinet se istipha dene ke baad se siddhu chuppi saadhe hue hai
 He is meeting his supporters in Amritsar, but is not talking about his political future
 isi bich siddhu ko dilli congress pradesh adhyaksh banane kii charchaa tej he
 If Navjot Sidhu is entrusted with the command of Delhi, then it will probably be the first case in the country that a leader should become the president of another state while being an MLA in one state
 siddhu maujuuda samay main amritsar purv se vidhayak hai
 Let us tell that Navjot Singh Sidhu left the BJP only on the condition that he did not want to leave Punjab, whereas BJP wanted Sidhu to contest from Haryana
 siddhu ne bijepi kii is shart ko nakaar diya tha or party ko alavida kah diya tha
 Now the Congress also wants to bring Sidhu out of Punjab into the politics of another state
 aise main sawaal he ki kya siddhu punjab chhodkar dilli kii siyaasi pich par utrenge
 After the death of Sheila Dixit, there is zero situation in Delhi Pradesh Congress

 According to sources, the faction of other old and senior leaders of Punjab Congress including Captain Amarinder Singh did not want Sidhu, who joined the party just 15 days before the assembly elections, to be placed in the second position in the Punjab government
 in puraane congressi netaaon ke dhade kaa ye dabaav kaam bhi aayaa or alaakaman tathaa congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi par lagaataar dabaav daalane ke baavjood siddhu dipti siem banate banate rah gaye
 This tear of not getting the post of Deputy CM was also seen on Sidhu's face
 jabashapath grahankarne ke liye navjot singh siddhu manch par aae to unhone duusare mantriyon kii tarah captain amarinder singh ko koi abhivadan nahin kiya or jab vah shapath lekar neeche laut rahe the, tab bhi unhone captain amarinder singh ko andekha kar diya
 However, the captain then raised his hand to greet Navjot Singh Sidhu
 iske baad siddhu ne bhi captain amarinder singh ke pair chhukar unase aashirwad liya
 The pain of not getting the post of deputy CM on the face of this former cricketer was evident even after the swearing-in reporters asked him what he was going to do as a minister for the people of Punjab, Sidhu brushed aside all these questions He was seen avoiding media questions
 congress ne siddhu kii is naaraazgi or dipti siem pad khone kii tis par pardaa daalane kii koshish kii
 Many Punjab Congress leaders avoided this question and many leaders said that Sidhu neither sought the post of Deputy CM nor was he made any such promise while joining the party on behalf of Congress
 vahiin is puure mudde par punjab congress kii prabharee aashaa kumari kaa kahana tha ki dipti siem ke kayaason ko lekar jo baaten uth rahi hai, vah media kaa hi banaaya hua jaal he
 He said, 'there is no truth of any kind in these speculations
 siddhu congress party ke asli sipaahi hai or bina kisi pad kii chaah main wo punjab ke hit main kaam karnaa chaahate hai
 ' congress ne press conference main sarkaar ko gheraa, uthaae kai savaalkaha- piem ko videshi chunaav main prachaar nahin karnaa chahiecongress ne mahangaai, berogari or suraksha ko mudda banayacongress pravaktaa sharmishtha mukherjee ne bhaajapa sarkaar par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said that the people of the country are troubled by many problems, but in America, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is saying that everything is good in India
 mukherjee ne pichley saat dinon se bad rahi petrol kii keemat par sarkaar ko gheraa
 He said that with the increase in the price of petrol, inflation of everything will increase
 unhone kaha ki aarthik mandi ke kaaran desh main lagaataar naukariyaan chin raheen hai or piem kar rahe hai ki sabakuch thik he
 Sharmistha Mukherjee said that if the Prime Minister is strongly welcomed abroad, it is a matter of pride for the country
 desh ke pehle pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru ko bhi videshon main jabardast sammaan miltaa tha
 Not only this, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and Manmohan Singh were also strongly welcomed abroad
 isse desh ko garv mahasoos hota rahaa he
 But it is not fair that Prime Minister Modi went to America and campaigned for foreign elections
 unhone ye baat congress mukhyalay main yojit ek press conference ke dauraan kahi
 Let us tell you that PM Modi said during the Howdy Modi program in Houston that this time Trump government
 is mudde par congress ne sarkaar ko gheraa he
 Sharmistha Mukherjee said, "whichever government comes by electing in the elections of another country, our relationship is good with that government
 lekin bharat kaa yah kabhi bhi videsh niti nahin rahaa he ki desh kaa piem duusare desh main jaakar kisi ke liye chunaav prachaar kare
 Congress does not agree with this
 ''sharmishtha mukherjee ne bharat main badhati mahangaai, berogari or suraksha jaise mudde ko uthaate hue baari-baari se har mudde par sarkaar ko kathghare main khadaa kiya
 He said that the PM said in America that everything is good in India
 yah kahkar vah apni jimmedaari se peeche nahin hat sakate hai
 He said that the government will have to answer what it is doing on the issue of inflation
 unhone kaha ki modi kii pehali sarkaar main petrol par exise duty kai guna badi he
 Unemployment is at its peak in 45 years
 berogari dar 8 fisadi he or 8 karod log berozegaar hai
 GDP has reached 5 percent

 According to Mehul, he donates sperm five times a month and he gets Rs 500 every time

 When European champions Portugal begin their campaign against neighboring Spain in the FIFA World Cup on Friday, all eyes will be on Cristiano Ronaldo
 ronaldo apane chamakdaar kariyar main vishwa cap trophy hasil karne kaa sambhavat: aakhri prayaas karenge
 The Spanish team will forget the decision of abrupt dismissal of coachjullen lopeteguico in this match
 lopetegui real madrid se judane ja rahe hai, jo ronaldo kaa club he
 Not only this, six players from Spain are also associated with this club and so it will be an interesting sight when 33-year-old Ronaldo is seen against his club mates
 ronaldo haalanki abhi club ke bare main nahin, balki vishwa cap ke bare main soch rahe hai, kyonki unke naam par agar koi trophy darj nahin he to vah vishwa cap he
 Portugal is considered a strong contender for the title
 usne do saal pehle france ko haraakar europea khitaab jeeta tha
 Even though Ronaldo is now 33 years old, he is physically strong and is the current Ballon d'or winner
 vah jab tak chahen tab tak khel sakate hai, lekin 2022 main apane paanchaven vishwa cap main unki vaapasi kii kalpana karnaa mushkil he
 If he has to add a World Cup winner in front of his name, this is the best chance
 isse behatar kya ho saktaa he ki portugal apane padosi ke khilaaf jeet darj karke group bi main sheersh sthaan hasil kare jisamen iran or morocco do anya timen hai
 His Portuguese partner João Mario said, "cristiano Ronaldo is definitely the best player in the world right now and he will be the top player in this World Cup
 usko bayaan karne ke liye koi shabd nahin hai
 'ronaldo played in that match when Portugal defeated Spain in a big tournament earlier
 euro 2004 ke group charan ke is match main portugal ne 1-0 se jeet darj kii thi
 He was then only 19 years old and is now one of the highest goalscorers for his country
 ronaldo ke naam 81 gol darj hai
 He played his 150th match in the recent friendly against Algeria
 euro 2016 ke final main vah keval 25 minute khel paae the or chotil hone ke kaaran unhen baahar baithna padaa tha
 Portugal's champion was then scored by Eder's extra-time goal
 vishwa cap main ab tak ronaldo teen toornament main keval teen gol kar paae hai or vah rus main apana record sudhaarney ke liye nishchit taur par patibaddh honge
 Portugal then have to face relatively weak teams of Iran and Morocco
 ranbir kapur kaa janm 28 sitambar 1982 ko hua
 Although everyone of the Kapoor family was happy at his birth, but there was no place for happiness for Raj Kapoor
 isaki ek khaas vajah thi
 Actually, Raj Kapoor had got the first grandson, who would call him Dada

 peshawar north west frontier provinance main sthit he
 Its border is with Afghanistan

 Obviously, this legacy will be carried forward from generation to generation, but the feeling that Ranbir Kapoor got will remain only on his part and will remain priceless

 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav 2017 main bas kuch hi din shesh hai
 In such a situation, while the Congress is claiming its victory this time, the BJP says that it will be their victory in any case
 isi kadi main piemo main rajya mantri dow jitendra singh ne daawa kiya he ki gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main congress chaahe jitna jor laga le, uskaa koi laabh nahin hone vaala
 Rahul Gandhi and Hardik Patel 'club' also will not win the Congress
 jitendra singh ne kaha kigujarat vidhansabha chunaavkarib he or jaise-jaise iske din najadik aa rahe hai bijepi kii sthiti or majboot hoti ja rahi he
 You will see how the BJP will win there on the 18th with an overwhelming majority
 rahul kii koshishon se bijepi ko laabhunhone daawa kiya kiraahul gandhi gujarat menjitna prayaas karte hai, utani hi teji se bijepi vahaan par aage badhati he
 It is also better from the point of view of democracy that Rahul Gandhi has fielded himself and it is good for the people that he will be able to test Rahul Gandhi with how much vision he is and how much better he can do
 hardik se samjhaute kaa koi asar naheenjitendra singh ne daawa kiya ki bijepi par congress or hardik patel ke samjhauton kaa koi prabhaav nahin padegaa
 Because the balloon of Hardik Patel and Congress has exploded there
 maine pehle bhi kaha tha ki ek haara hua khilaadi duusare haare hue khilaadi ke saath milakar kis tareeke se gujarat kii aam janata ko samajha paaenge
 Both are trying to save each other by holding each other
 lekin unako yah pataa nahin he ki donon ek duusare ko hi le doobenge
 The Gujarat of 2017 is the Gujarat of youth
 70% yahaan par yuva hai or wo mejority voters hai
 You will see that all these youths will join PM Modi
 rahulke paas nahin thos ranneetisingh ne kaha ki yuva aaj prashn poochta he ki rahul gandhi or hardik patel milakar kis tareeke se gujarat ko aage badhayenge
 Because they neither have any concrete policy regarding reservation nor any information about working on it or taking initiative
 congress kahati hai ki pehle bijepi ko haraate hai or phir dekhte hai ki aakhir yuvaaon ke liye kis tareeke se kaam karnaa he
 But the youth of Gujarat cannot be seduced by this side
 jitendra singh ne yah bhi kaha ki jaise hi congress kii taraf se pradhanmantri ko chaay vaale par tippanee ko lekar baatcheet kii gai, hamen usase lag gaya ki jitna congress party is tareeke kii baatcheet karegi, yah hamaare liye upkaar hoga
 The election of Gujarat will become easier for us
 unhone kaha ki jahaan tak jiesti kii baat he, jiesti ko lekar gujarat ke vyapaariyon ko samajhaayaa gaya he or jiesti ko lekar ab koi virodh gujarat ke vyapaariyon main nahin he
 Initially there were some apprehensions among the traders of Gujarat, there were some misunderstandings, which the Congress party was capitalizing on
 par ab gujarat ke vyapaaree bijepi ke saath hai

 ayodhya main ram janmabhumi or babari masjid ko lekar vivaad par supreme court ne sunwaayee kii
 During this time, the court has given the Sunni Waqf Board 12 weeks to translate the documents and witnesses related to the case
 vahiin maamle ke ek pakshakaar ramalala virajman kii maang par supreme court ne unhen chaar hafton kaa vakt de diya
 The Supreme Court, while deciding the next hearing of the case on December 5, made it clear that no further delay will be given to any party nor the case will be adjourned
 bataa den ki is maamle se jude 9,000 pannon ke dastavej or 90,000 pannon main darj gavaahiyaan paali, farsi, sanskrit, arabi sahit vibhinn bhashaaon main darj hai, jis par sunni vakf board ne court se in dastavezon ko anuwaad karaane kii maang kii thi
 Let me tell you that in the hearing on the controversy over the Ram Janmabhoomi and Babri Masjid in Ayodhya started in the Supreme Court on Friday, the Associate Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, on behalf of the UP government, first of all sought to complete the hearing of the case at the earliest, At the same time, the Sunni Waqf Board objected that this hearing is being done without due process
 vahiin maamle main ek vaadi subramanyam swami ne vivaadit sthal par logon ko puja karne kaa adhikaar dene kii maang kii
 On this, the bench of the Supreme Court first asked all the litigants to clarify who is the party from whose side
 is par sunni board kii taraf se pairvi kar rahe varisht vakil kapil sibbal ne kaha ki is maamle ke kai pakshakaron kaa nidhan ho chukaa he, aise main unhen badalane kii jarurat he
 Along with this, he said that the documents related to this case are in many languages, so they should be translated first
 swami kii daleelon par vakt board kii kakyodhya vivaad par sunwaayee ke dauraan subrahmanyam swami ne supreme court se kaha ki yah koi divaani vivaad nahin, balki moulik adhikaron kaa maamla he
 At the same time, Swami changed it from civil to be seen as a matter of public interest
 swami kii is daleel par sunni vakf board ne virodh jataate hue kaha, yah sawaal to supreme court pehle hi hal kar chukaa he
 Waqf Board counsel Sibal said that a Supreme Court bench of 5 judges had ruled in 1994 that a civil case related to the ownership of this land would be heard separately
 bataa den ki supreme court ne is behad ahm maamle ke nipataane ke liye teen jajon- justise deepak mishra, ashok bhushan or abdul nazeer kii vishesh bench gathit kii he
 This bench will hear the petitions challenging the decisions of the Allahabad High Court and the decision on the ownership of the disputed land daily
 shiya vakf board ne maamle main daalaa nayaa penchis sunwaayee se thik pehle shiya vakf board ne adaalat main arji lagaakar maamle main nayaa pench daal diya
 The Shia board claimed to be parties to the dispute
 shiya vakf board ne 70 saal baad 30 march 1946 ke trial court ke faisle ko chunauti di he, jisamen masjid ko sunni vakf board kii property qaraar diya gaya tha
 The Shia Waqf Board said at the disputed site that in its application, the Shia Waqf Board has admitted that the Mir Baqi Neram temple was built by demolishing the Babri Masjid
 pehali baar kisi muslim sanghathan ne aadhikarik taur par mana ki vivaadit sthal par ram mandir tha
 Significantly, on Tuesday, the Shia Waqf Board filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court
 shiya board kaa suzav he ki vivaadit jagah par ram mandir banaaya janaa chahie
 Ramjanam Bhoomimandir Trust and Sunni Waqf Board are parties in this case, as the Shia Board lost the case to the Sunni Board in 1946 over the rights to the disputed site
 ram janmabhumi se dur bane masjidahalafname main kaha gaya he ki ayodhya main bhagawanram ke janmasthalase ek uchit duuri par muslim bahul ilaake main masjid banaai ja sakati he
 The Shia Waqf Board said in the affidavit that the proximity between the two shrines should be avoided, as the use of loudspeakers by both could cause hindrance to each other's religious work
 shiya vakf board ne yah bhi kaha ki is maamle se sunni vakf board kaa koi sambandh nahin he, kyonki masjid ek shiya sampatti thi
 Therefore, only Shia Central Waqf Board Uttar Pradesh has the right to negotiate with its other parties for peaceful settlement of the case

 desh main rajaneta aakhir chunaavon main matdaan se kuch din pehle hi prachaar main sari takat kyon jhonkate hai? virodhiyon ko nishaanaa banane ke liye shabdabaanon kii barsaat karte hai? iskaa jawaab bhartiya votaron ke zehan main chupa he
 Around 45% of the country's electorate make up their mind about which candidate to vote for after the start of the election process
 bharat or pashchimi deshon khaskar america or britain ke matdaan ke samay kiye gaye eczit pole bataate hai ki kareeb 14 fisadi bhartiya matdaan kii purvasandhya par tay karte hai ki unhen kise vot dena chahie
 This is the fact that keeps troubling the sun and parties in the election arena till the last moment
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan siesds ke agsit pole ko aadhaar banaaen to 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main kul 90 karod voters main se 13 karod voters matdaan vaale din hi ummidavaaron ke bhagya kaa faisla karenge
 In the exit poll of CSDS, 8 percent of the voters refused to disclose anything about their voting habits or opinion form during exit poll surveys
 haalanki 13 fisadi aise bhartiya matadaata bhi hai jo apana faisla aakhri din par nahin chhodte
 Such voters decide their voting preferences in the week immediately before the vote
 aise voter kii sankhya 12 karod baithti he jo voting se ek haftaa pehle hi apni raay banaate hai
 18 percent of such voters are strong-minded
 ye chunaav prachaar shuru hote hi apana pasandida ummidavaar chun lete hai
 They are like double-edged swords
 aise voter achaanak hone vaale ghatnakramon, raajnneetik galatiyon yaa partiyon kii ore se campan ke utaar chadhaav se prabhavit nahin hote
 An exit poll conducted in 2014 by the Center for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) on a polling day concluded that 47% of the participants had made up their mind as to who to vote before the election was announced
 dilachasp he ki desh ke baaki 47% voter vafaadaar voter hai
 Such voters are the hallmark of the political strength of Mayawati (BSP), Akhilesh Yadav (SP) and other satraps
 sakshya bataate hai ki raajnneetik dal is voting pattern se acchhee tarah avgat hai
 Turning back to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, it is known that BJP and its allies won 73 out of the total 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh
 bataa den ki uttar pradesh main tab chah charnon main chunaav hua tha
 At that time, Narendra Modi, the bjp's prime ministerial candidate, had started a massive campaign and started rallies in Uttar Pradesh after a sudden three-phase completion
 bijepi kaa data bataata he ki sitambar 2013 se may 2014 ke bich modi ne 5827 reliyon / chaay par charchaa / kaaryakramon / aayojanon main hissaa liya tha
 About 30 per cent of these 1787 events took place between March and May 2014
 us varsh chunaav tarikhon kaa elaan 5 march ko hua tha
 Is such an attitude of voters extraordinary? Are Indians doing something different that does not happen in democratic countries like America and Britain? The answer is both yes and no
 britain ke voter chunaav se bahut pehle hi pakkaa man bana lene vaale hote hai
 The core voters there or 51 percent of the total voters who make up their mind before the election announcement
 is desh main aakhri vakt par man bana lene vaale voter teenon loktantric deshon main sabase kam hai
 Only 7% of the voters are here who do not know who to vote till the eve of voting
 agar bharat main 13 fisadi voter aise hai jo matdaan se ek haftaa pehle apana man banaate hai to britain main aise voter 9 fisadi hai
 By the time the Conservative Party or Labor Party starts campaigning in Britain, by then 33% of the voters have decided who to vote for
 britain main tasviir isliye bhi saaf he kyonki vahaan survey main koi bhi pratibhaagi apane voting swabhaav ko chupaane kii koshish nahin karata
 If you go beyond the Atlantic, America's voters are very much like India
 2016 main america chunaav main 8 fisadi voter aise the jinhone matdaan vaale din hi tay kiya ki republikans yaa democrates main se kise vot dena he
 In the week before the vote there, 5 percent of the voters made up their mind
 vahiin donald trump or hillari clinton ke prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan 24 fisadi votaron ne tay kiya ki kise vot dena he
 Before the campaign started, only 3% of the voters were not sure who to vote for
 jabaki 60% voter sunishchit the ki kise apana vot dena he
 Experts say that one of the reasons for the last-minute swing in India is that voters who cannot form opinion can be affected by cash or other inducements

 The language of the news channels has changed, such language itself is creating a frenzy within the people
 lekin kya sach main aam aadmi yuddh chahta he? jo sainik border par desh kii raksha kar rahaa he wo yuddh chahta he? sainik ke parivaar ke log yuddh chaahate hai? shaayad nahin
 Members of many such military families are coming forward who are against the war
 jis aasaani se yah kah diya jaataa he ki sainik bane ho to yuddh karnaa padegaa, yah galat he
 Joining defense is not just war
 yuddh ke dauraan jab kisi sainik kii maut ho jaati he, uske parivaar ke upar kya asar hota he wo sirf parivaar hi janata he
 We also met other people who say that peace should be resolved through peace, not war
 kapade press karne vaale dinesh ne kaha ki shanti se aage badhanaa chahie
 Even those who sell vegetables from fruits believe that the problem should be solved by negotiation, not war
 jab ek aam aadmi yuddh nahin shanti chahta he to phir padhe likhe log or ankar yuddh ke liye kaise ballebaaji kar rahe hai

 petrol pump maalik nai keemat par bechakar dedh lakh rupee kaa phayda kama saktaa tha lekin usne aisa nahin kiya
 Sameer Azad, owner of Azad Filling Station in Munavarabad area of the old city, made the decision after seeing an elderly auto driver buying oil in bottles after the news of petrol price hike
 aaazaad ne bataaya, ‘vah aadmi jis bhi tarah se petrol le saktaa tha, le rahaa tha
 He even took petrol in a bottle of drinking water

 54 rupees per liter has been increased, so that vehicles were queued at petrol pumps across the country to take oil at the old rates

 The yo-yo fitness test has become so mandatory for selection in Team India that the BCCI is not averse to bypassing players who are in great form
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki jab khilaadi ke paas ran banane or wicket lene kii kshamta he, to unako yo-yo test ke chalate team se baahar kyon kiya ja rahaa he
 Even without the yo-yo test, these veterans have dominated and there was a time when the players were not happy with this test and they remained in the team because of their great performance
 pakistan ke injamaam ul haq, srilanka ke arjuna rantunga or australia ke diggaj khilaadi david boon jaise adhik vajan ke khilaadiyon ne bhi apane desh ke liye behtareen cricket khelaa he
 Sachin Tendulkar, one of the greatest batsmen of cricket without a yo-yo test, played cricket for India till the age of 40 and scored runs
 iske alaava sachin ke saath team india ko visphotak shuruyaat dene vaale virendra sahvaag ne bhi yo-yo test ke bina bharat ke liye dheron record banaae hai
 Australia ahead of England's world record, broken 32-year record after Informa Rayudu now hangs on Rohit, Indian team captain Virat Kohli led Indian team to England for three T20 matches, three odis and five matches Test series to be played
 bhartiya team main chayan ke liye ab sabhi khilaadiyon kaa yo-yo test anivaary ho gaya he, lekin is yo-yo test ke chalate team ke kai star khilaadi baahar ho rahe he
 a star player like Ambati Rayudu is out due to failure in yo-yo test
 ipel main ranon kaa ambara lagane vaale ambati raidu ko bharat kii england daure par jane vaali vanade team se baahar kar diya gaya tha
 Let us tell you that Rohit Sharma is yet to have a yo-yo test and if Rohit too is out of the England tour due to the yo-yo test, then Team India will get a big blow
 shami bhi ho chuke hai baharyo-yo test main fail hone ke kaaran mohammad shami ko afghanistan ke khilaaf hue ekmaatr test match ke liye team se baahar kar diya gaya tha
 This insistence of the BCCI can prove to be a detriment to the Indian team, because if such players are out of the team then the Indian team may have to lose the series in England as well

 Although this film could not break the record of Salman's biggest grossing film till date, but the film did a decent business at the box office
 tiger jinda he ke hit hone kii vajah film ke teen factors the-damdaar ection, dialogs or hit mujeec
 But Race 3 seems to be lagging behind in these three factories
 film ke trailor main jari dialogs ko khub trol kiya gaya or ab tak relies ho chuke chaaron gane bhi kuch khaas kamaal nahin dikhaa paae hai
 Now, the entire responsibility of the film being a hit rests on the story, if the twist and turn of the film is excellent, then perhaps the film will earn a good profit

 The film disappointed fans of Bhaijaan due to the weak story and screen play
 lekin salmaan ke staradam kii badaulat ye film 100 karod club main entry karne main kaamyaab to ho hi gai thi
 That is why it would not be wrong to say that if Salman's Race 3 does not appeal to the audience at the box office, then this film will easily enter the 100 to 200 crore club

 market or maas media main hindi jab lagaataar nai safalataa hasil kar rahi he, tab hindi kaa sahitya jagat kis soch main duba he
 In the Hindi arena, the riots continue face-to-face Hindi and English
 is bich ek nai bhashaa na sirf ubhar rahi he, balki sabase zyada popular bhi ho rahi he-hinglish
 Its popularity is that the British linguist at the University of Wales, David Crystal, has calculated that Hinglish speakers in the world will soon outnumber English speakers
 yah sachaai ab hindi ke sahityakaron ko sweekaar kerani pad rahi he ki bhashaa badal rahi he
 Otherwise, there was a time when the Hindi language was dominated by the orthodox, purist, who saw Hindi as the daughter of Sanskrit
 aazaadee ke baad is baat kii baqayada koshish hui ki hindi apni tathakthith jadon yani sanskrit kii ore laute

 Critic Namvar Singh says, "language has had a history of mixing
" urdu main arabi or farsi kaa mishran, hindi main urdu kaa mishran, hindi main sanskrit kaa mishran
 Amir Khusro used to write in Persian and Braj simultaneously
 tulsi or kabir kii lok boli main sanskrit se lekar farsi tak ke anek shabd mil jaaenge
 This is how language is created
 angreji aae, acha he, hindi isse badhegi hi
 The spoken words and expressions of Indian immigrants in England have been adopted in the colloquial English there
 namvar singh ek udhaaharan dete hai, ''morishas kii bhojpuri main french ke anek shabd mili hue hai
 They say, 'put Kitabiya on Latab
 ' latab french shabd he, jiskaa arth he mej
 The table in his language is in French and Kitabiya in Bhojpuri
 '' is aadan-pradaan ne donon bhashaaon ko samrudgh kiya
 If the culture changes then the language also
 hindi kii lekhika or patrkaar mrinal pandeya kahati hai, ''angreji kaa ek shabd he relationships
 What will be translated into Hindi? Kinship? It is a matter of a new kind of relationship
 yah rishte kaa swatantra or aatmanirbhar chunaav he, rakt or parampara kaa sambandh nahin
 The current word for live in relationship is not in Hindi because no such thing has ever existed in Hindi society
 '' hindi ke varisht lekhak or aalochak asagar vajahat hindi kii sankeernata par ungali uthaate hai,''hindi main kabhi bhi angreji shabdon ko apnaane ke prati udaartaa nahin rahi
 This stubbornness and stubborn attitude has caused the biggest loss of Hindi
 varanaa kya vajah he ki aaj hindi bolne waalon kii taadaad to bad rahi he, lekin padhane vaale kam ho rahe hai?''asagar maanate hai ki hindi kii seva sirf popular media kar rahaa he
 Ramkripal Singh, executive editor of the Hindi newspaper Navbharat Times, which uses English in Hindi, says, "there is no alternative to the public medium
" jo chal rahaa he, use hi sweekaar karnaa hoga
 Newspaper Communication is business
 isliye hamen usee bhashaa main baat kerani hogi, jo bahusankhyak logon ko communicket ho
 "shashi Shekhar, editor of the Hindi newspaper Hindustan, says," If the language is adamant, it will rot
 wo to bahata hua pani he
 Today, if the language of youth is English, we cannot read them by printing newspapers in pure Hindi
 ''akhbaar kii bhashaa popularity ke paksh main hinglish kaa tark detii he or baat samaj main bhi aa jaati he
 But then why is there no such request for communication in the language of literature? Why is the literary language so soulless and arduous that literature is sold less and read less? Rajendra Yadav, an eminent Hindi writer and editor of Hans magazine, is also in favor of Sahaj language, yet he is making the literary language popular in the popular medium
 Advocates of keeping it separate from language
 ve kehete hai, ''sahitya kabhi bhi bahusnkhyakon ke liye nahin hota
 It is a class thing
 akhbaar lakhon main bikta he, hans kii 15,000 kapiyaan chhapati hai
 In literary classicalism, there will always be few people consuming the juice
 sabhi ko vah ras milane lage, jaruri nahin he
 "how far is it appropriate to close the English window?" Will the opposition of English and Hinglish not bring Hindi back into the same old reactionary camp? The logic of Alok Rai, a professor of English, thinker and grandson of Munshi Premchand, is something else
 ve kehete hai, ''main bhashaa ke mishran ke khilaaf nahin, lekin sawaal yah he ki kya shabd udhaar dene or lene vaali donon bhashaaon kii takat, haisiyat or rutaba samaan he? agar nahin to ek taqatvar or kamjor ke bich barabari kaa len-dein kaise mumkin he? is len-dein kii hindi ko sachmuch samrudgh karne or aage badhaane main bhoomika tabhi ho sakati he, jab vah hindi kii sharton par ho
 Filmmaker Dibakar Banerjee, who works in the language of popular medium, also sees the relationship of non-equality in Hinglish
 ve kehete hai, ''har daur main samaaj ke ucch, sattashin varg kii bhashaa aam jan kii bhashaa se alag rahi he
 In Sanskrit texts, the king and superior people speak Sanskrit, then the servants, servants and women speak in Prakrit
 vahaan bhi unki bhashaa ek nahin he
 When the government was in Sanskrit, the people did not even speak Sanskrit, nor did the pure Persian language of power ever exist
 aaj satta kii bhashaa angreji he, lekin vah janata kii bhashaa nahin he
 Some English words have been added to the public language
 amiron kii bhashaa kaa juuthan
 We are Elite Englishmen, you can be happy to be an Englishman with this broken Hinglish and be happy
 ''satta kii bhashaa baaki bhashaaon par asar daalati he
 The one who sells, walks
 bazaar ke isi tark par tiki he hinglish
 But the arguments with which the market itself operates need to be debated separately
 philhal, aaj baat phir usee romantic candal lite dinar kii he
 They are also happy to see this, who has candle light dinner in their life and also those who aspire to resemble or become a candle light dinner class

 Raj said that in 2014, voters, who make fun of the drought-stricken Maharashtra people, will be taught such a lesson that they will remember for a lifetime

 sanjay raut ne kaha ki ajit pavaar ne maharashtra ke logon kaa apmaan kiya he or unhen fouran mantrimandal se nikaala janaa chahie
 Sanjay Raut said that being a minister of people like Ajit Pawar is a stigma for Maharashtra
 ajit pavaar ne ravivaar ko pune ke indapur taluka main ek kaarykram ke kaha tha kinadi main pani hi nahin he to wo kya karen
 Even it was fine, but after this, the solution which he suggested by jhalla can not be considered less than abusive language
 haalanki bavaal badhata dekh ajit pavaar ne maafee maangane main der nahin lagaai
 Poked fun at the rally but issued a press release secretly apologizing
 unhone kaha ki wo sookhaa raahat ke liye kaam karte rahenge

 Who will be in the role of finisher for Team India now? After the defeat in Ranchi ODI, this question is arising in the minds of cricket fans
 ranchi vanade main captain mahendra singh dhoni number 4 par ballebaazi karne aae

 ---input IANS se Ever since becoming the Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath was applying his kind of politics in the entire state with high speed
 haalanki ravivaar kaa cabinet vistaar siem yogi ke liye ek bada speed braker sabit hua
 In a way, through this cabinet expansion, PM Modi has given a clear signal to Yogi that even though he is the CM of the state, check and balance is very important in politics and only one person's intention and choice did not run the government
 Can go
 siem yogi kaa is tarah se soobe kii sarkaar chalaanaa shaayad modi ko bhi shaayad nagavaar guzar rahaa tha
 That is why Modi has given the first blow to Yogi by giving his opponent Shiva Pratap Shukla a place in his cabinet
 shiv pratap shuklako mantri banaakar narendra modi ne sabase mahatvapurn rajya main jatigat sameekaran ke balance ko bhi sanbhaalane kii koshish kii he
 Shiva Pratap Shukla himself comes from Gorakhpur and is seen as an effective face of Brahmins in the party
 shiv pratap shukla lagaataar chaar baar vidhansabha kaa chunaav jeeta he
 Also served as Minister in MLA and UP in 1989,1991,1993 and 1996
 lekin yogi ne apane siyaasi varchasv kaayam karne ke liye shiv pratap ke khilaaf apana pratyaashee khadaa karke unhen chunaav haravaaya tha
 From here the political feud between the two will begin
 yogi neshiv pratap shukla kii puri siyasatkhatm kar di thi
 He was sidelined in the BJP, but did not give up his loyalty to the party
 narendra modi jab 2014 main pradhanmantri bane to shiv pratap shukla kii 14 saal ke baad siyaasi punaruddhar hua
 He became a Rajya Sabha member and is now going to become a minister in the Modi cabinet
 yogi adityanath ke upi kaa siem banane ke baad se soobe kaa brahman samaaj baichaiyn mahasoos kar rahaa tha

 The police raided the house of Harishankar Tiwari, considered a Brahmin leader of Purvanchal as soon as Yogi was seated in power
 brahmanon ne ise yogi ke ishaare par karrwai maani
 The killing of 5 Brahmins in Rae Bareli further increased the resentment of the Brahmins towards the BJP
 isiilie brahman apane aapako thaga hua mahasoos karne laga tha
 In such a situation, Modi has given many messages by giving Shiv Pratap Shukla a place in his cabinet

 He said, 'lal Bahadur Shastri resigned for his principles
 shastri kii bhaanti main bhi vahi karuunga

 ’bijepi ke garh ramnagar ke tripolia main shanivaar ko logon ko sambodhit karte hue kejariwal ne kaha, ‘main yahaan kisi gaanv main gaya tha, jahaan mujhe dekhte hi yuvaaon ne modi modi kaa naaraa lagaana shuru kar diya
 i asked him why Modi should become the Prime Minister of the country, so he had no answer
 ’unhone kaha, ‘maine unke baatcheet kii

 The former Delhi Chief Minister appealed to people not to 'superstition' on Modi, saying that what the media is showing about the Chief Minister of Gujarat is different from reality

 Asked about the idea of curbing inflation, Reddy said, "inflation is not just an issue related to the monetary sector
 For this, there is a need to take sensible measures from the fiscal side also
 ’ Asked whether all types of loans for inflation control should be controlled or cut in select categories, Reddy opted to curb credit flow in select sectors, which was suggested by former RBI Governor IG Patel long ago

 The comments reddy ne kaha maudrik niti ke tareekon se aamtaur par rin kii laagat or uplabdhta prabhavit hoti he
 But if the situation in the economy is such that there is a need to expand in some areas while debt reduction in some areas, then the option of selection in some areas should be adopted for monetary control

 But whatever is the fiscal situation, everything needs to be done to ensure that there is no instability

 Higher interest rates have less effect
 lekin jo rajkoshiya sthiti he aise main koi asthirataa na paidaa ho yah sunishchit karne ke liye sab kuch karne kii jarurat he
