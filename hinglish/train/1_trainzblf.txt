 lakhanu main 11 farvari ko bhavy rodsho ke saath priyanka gandhi wadra ne purvi uttar pradesh kii chunaav prabharee or congress mahasachiv ke taur par aadhikarik rup se raajnneeti main kadam rakhaa
 Then his brother and party president Rahul Gandhi instructed the workers not to target the Samajwadi Party (SP) during the Lok Sabha elections
 kuch hi ghanton baad sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav ne firozabad jile main ek shaadi samaaroh ke dauraan priyanka ke 'safal' rodsho par khushi jaahir kii
 He said, "it is a good thing that the anti-bjp parties are getting good response
 isse bhi acchhee baat he ki congress yah abhiyaan chalaa rahi he
 He also said that Congress is also a part of the grand alliance of SP, BSP and other smaller parties
 akhilesh kii is pratikriya ne nae sire se charchaa ched di he kyonki pichley maheene hi sapa or basapa ne congress ko alag karte hue mahagathbandhan kii ghoshnaa kar di thi
 In response, the Congress announced to contest elections on all the seats alone and also launched Priyanka and imposed 'master stroke'
 congress ke sutron ke mutabik, priyanka ko utaarne kii vajah yah thi ki sapa-basapa congress ko 10 se zyada siten dene ke liye taiyaar nahin thim
 At the same time, the grassroots workers of the party had told Rahul that if the party does not contest more than half of the total seats in the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, then the organization of the party will be lost
 lekin congress ke kuch varisht netaaon kii chetavanee thi ki sapa-basapa gathbandhan se baahar akele chunaav ladgaye se bhaajapa-virdohi vot bant jaaenge
 However, the analysis of the data by the Congress suggests this possibility as incorrect
 us vishleshan main shaamil rahe congress ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''hamane paaya ki gaiyr-bhaajapa matadaataaon (anusuchit jati, anya pichhadi jatiyaan or musalmaan) ke vot agar sapa-basapa gathbandhan or congress ke bich 50-50 fisadi bant jate hai to hamaari party bhaajapa or sapa-basapa gathbandhan, donon ko haraa sakati he, basharte savarna vot hamen acchhee sankhya main mil jaaen
 Priyanka's entry, a descendant of the Gandhi family and the Brahmin face, is also aimed at wooing upper caste voters, especially Brahmins
 congress ke data vishleshan prakoshth ke pramukh praveen chakravarti kehete hai, ''yuvaaon or mahilaon main priyanka kaaphi lokapriy hai
 Akhilesh's statement indicates that the SP-BSP leadership is reconsidering its strategy
 beete ek maheene main sapa or congress ke varisht netaaon ke bich kai baar baatcheet hui he
 Priyanka, who played a key role in forming the congress-sp alliance in 2017, has raised hopes of uniting the two parties by keeping the BSP together
 haalanki, congress purvi upi main khuli chhot chaahati he jo sapa ko sweekaar nahin hogi
 In fact, in 2017 SP had won 27 out of 54 assembly seats in Eastern UP
 iske alaava musalmaan, jinaki sankhya rajya kii kul aabaadi main 19 pratishat he, in donon hi partiyon kaa ahm vot bank hai
 Manish Hindavi, associate professor at Lucknow University, says, "the SP-BSP knows that their rise and fall depends on the inverse ratio of the Congress's success or failure
" '' sapa bhale hi congress se dobaaraa baatcheet kii icchhuk ho par basapa pramukh mayawati ko raji karnaa badi chunauti hogi
 Congress leaders hope that Sonia Gandhi, who has a good relationship with the BSP chief, can solve this problem
 vahiin priyanka ek baar phir madhyasth kii bhoomika nibhaa sakati hai
 *** duniya kaa sabase bada loktantr or taanaashaahee ke liye duniya kaa ek sabase badnaam desh kya aapas main dost hai? is sawaal kaa sidhaa jawaab dene kii bajaae ham iske kai pahaluon par baat karte hai
 According to a Newsflix report, India's Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju said in September 2016 that he felt there should be no old hurdles or doubts between the two countries
 unhone kaha tha ki north korea ekaswatantra deshhai or united neshns kaa sadsy bhi he
 However, over the years, India has accused North Korea of selling nuclear technology to Pakistan
 north korea ko is baat kii chintaa bhi rahi he ki bharat uske virdohi south korea se apni najdiki badha rahaa he
 However, the latest update is that according to the United Nations proposal, India has decided not to supply anything to North Korea that would increase North Korea's military strength
 aapako bataa den ki 2008 se 14 ke bich north korea ke sainikon ko bharat ke maharashtra ke language training skool main antry bhi di gai thi

 India and Pakistan participated in the previous edition of the exercise last year

 Meanwhile, Bollywood producer-director Karan Johar has supported Padmavati
 unhone kaha ki film ko shanti se relies hone dena chahie
 Explain that the ongoing controversy over Padmavati is another big name of Bollywood who has supported the film
 unase pehle bollywood actor arjuna kapur ne bhi twit kar bhansaali kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Karan told Shah Rukh's son during a conversation at the session of Sahitya Aaj Tak on Saturday
 is dauraan unhone shahrukh khan ke bete ko bollywood kaa doosraa bada superstar bataaya
 He said that Aryan Khan will also prove to be a big star of Hindi cinema like Shahrukh
 kya shahrukh khan aakiri superstar?karan ne kaha is daur main super staradam kaa tag jo laga wo shahrukh kaa tha
 They will always be there
 shahrukh ne silver screen par romantic kahaniyon kaa daur lautaaya
 He is a superstar
 aaj bahut se log umdaa kaam kar rahe hai
 i think Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan will prove to be the future superhero
 isliye nahin ki wo shahrukh ke bete hai balki usamen tallent he
 'akbar the greatest, who considers himself a country, will change one day' i like to ask questions more than answers
 Johar said on a pinch of moderating session Anjana Om Kashyap, 'it is very unsuitable for me to answer questions
 
 kyonki main sawaal karata hum
 i do not like to answer much
 'javed akhtar ne kaha- 'padmavati kii kahani utani hi nakli jitani saleem kii anaarakali'kaajol-karina se vivaad parakaran ne kaha ki unka karina se vivaad rahaa
 The two did not talk for a year
 jab mere pita kii tabiyat thik nahin thi tab karina ne mujhe phone kiya
 In the talk, we realized how childish it was
 wo mujhase 10 saal choti he
 On the dispute with Kajor, Karan said, i love him very much
 hamaare bich vivaad hua par ab wo past he
 Our bonding is different
 main nepotism kaa hissaa hunnapotism par jari vivaad main ek baar phir apni raay rakhte hue karan ne mana ki wo khud iskaa hissaa hai
 He said, this is in every industry
 chunki mere pita produsar the mujhe iskaa phayda mila or us vajah se main filmmekar bana
 i was not qualified, i was not educated in films, i believe that because of my father i got opportunities
 aap industry kaa hissaa hai to aap ko iji acces jarur miltaa he
 It is in every industry, there is more discussion of the film industry
 lekin maine mehnat, lagan se kaam nahin kiya hota to shaayad is mukaam tak nahin pahunch paata
 It would have been difficult to maintain it
 mere jaise kai hasil kar lete hai or kai nahin
 Nepotism is a card that just helps give chance
 troling meraa brake fastmain apane aap ko nahin badal saktaa
 Even if someone trolls me
 pehle mujhe bahut dikkat hoti thi
 Does not happen now
 logon ko gaaliyaan deni hai to den
 i can not change myself

 In the complaint letter written to the church by the victim's husband, his wife made some confession before one of the accused priests, who according to church rules, the pastor should have confined himself only
 lekin aaropee padri ne uski patni dwaara kiye gaye kanfeshan ke jariye hi use blackmel karnaa shuru kar diya

 The controversy over the memorial of the late Shiv Sena chief Balasaheb Thackeray, which is going to be held in Mumbai, has reached the High Court
 isse shivasena netaaon main gussa he
 Expressing his anger, senior Shiv Sena leader and Maharashtra's Industries Minister Subhash Desai compared Balasaheb to Mahatma Gandhi
 saamaajik kaaryakarta bhagwaan rayani shivasena pramukh balasahab thakare memorial ko chunauti de chuke hai
 It is being described as his 115th PIL
 apni yachika main unhone thakare memorial ke naam par sarkari sansaadhan par hote atikaraman ko rokane kii maang kii he
 In a conversation with NDTV India, Ryani said that if they succeed in this petition, then such government resources will be curbed and hundreds of acres of land will be saved across the country
 tippaniyan In the name of Thackeray Memorial, Shiv Sena has managed to get a three-acre 3-acre government land adjacent to the sea in the middle Shivaji Park area of mumbai for 99 years on a lease of just one rupee
 jameen kaa maujuuda bazaar mulya karodon main he
 Not only this, an expenditure of Rs 100 crore has also been sanctioned in the name of Memorial from the Government vault
 balasahab thakare ke kisi bhi sanvaidhanik pad par na hote hue bhi di ja rahi in riyaayaton ke khilaaf hoicourt main daayar yachika se shivasena netaaon kaa paara chadh chukaa he
 On this matter, senior Shiv Sena leader and Maharashtra's Industries Minister Subhash Desai asked the media where Mahatma Gandhi was in a constitutional post, yet there are memorials in many places in his name
 to phir yah sawaal balasahab ko lekar hi kyon uthaae ja rahe hai? lekin phir bhi is babat jaruri jawaab rajya sarkaar court main degi
 Social activist Lord Rayani has challenged the Shiv Sena chief Balasaheb Thackeray Memorial
 yah unki 115veen janhit yachika bataai ja rahi he
 In his petition, he has sought to stop encroachment on government resources in the name of Thackeray Memorial
 NDTV india se baatcheet main rayani ne kaha ki agar ve is yachika main kaamyaab hote hai to deshbhar main is tarah se sarkari sansadhano par hone vaala kabza roka ja sakegaa or saikadon acre jameen batch jaaegi
 The comments thakare memorial ke naam par mumbai ke madhyavarti shivaji park ilaake main samandar se satee paune 3 acre sarkari jameen sirf ek rupee salanaa lij par 99 saal ke liye paane main shivasena kaamyaab hui he
 The current market value of the land is in crores
 yahi nahin, sarkari tijori se memorial ke naam par 100 karod rupee kaa kharch bhi manjuur karaayaa gaya he
 Despite the constitutional post of Balasaheb Thackeray, the Shiv Sena leaders have lost their temper with the petition filed in the High Court against these concessions being given
 is maamle par shivasena ke varisht netaa or maharashtra ke udyog mantri subhash desai ne media se poocha ki mahatma gandhi kahaan kisi sanvaidhanik pad par the, phir bhi unke naam par anek jagahon par smarak bane hue hai
 Then why are these questions being raised about Balasaheb? But even then the state government will give the necessary answer in this regard
 thakare memorial ke naam par mumbai ke madhyavarti shivaji park ilaake main samandar se satee paune 3 acre sarkari jameen sirf ek rupee salanaa lij par 99 saal ke liye paane main shivasena kaamyaab hui he

 yahi nahin, sarkari tijori se memorial ke naam par 100 karod rupee kaa kharch bhi manjuur karaayaa gaya he

 bollywood actor shahid kapur kii film kabir singh box offis par kamaal kii kamai kar rahi he
 The film is rapidly moving towards the 100 crore mark
 jahaan karodon log shahid kii film kii tarif kar rahe hai vahiin aise log bhi hai jo is film kaa lagaataar virodh kar rahe hai
 People opposing the film are giving different types of arguments
 ek doctor ne is film ke khilaaf shikaayat karte hue kaha he yah film doctoron ko galat dhang se dikhaati he
 a Mumbai doctor has lodged a complaint saying that the film shows doctors in a wrong way, because Shahid Kapoor's character in the film is that of a surgeon who drinks alcohol and takes drugs to make her heartbroken after falling in love
 He can forget his sorrow
 shikaayat karne vaale doctor ne na sirf mumbai police ko balki kendriya swasthya mantri ko bhi letters likhaa he
 Apart from this, the complainant has also written a letter to the Ministry of Information Broadcasting, State Health Ministry and the Censor Board to stop the screening of the film

 samiksha karne vaale yah tark bhi de rahe hai ki film ko vaastavik film jaisaa hi hoobahoo copy kar diya gaya he or isamen koi bhi nayaapan nahin rakhaa gaya he
 Let me tell you that Shobha Dey wrote while tweeting that i refuse to see Kabir Singh
 haalanki main shahid kapur kii bahut badi fain hum
 Stocking cannot be judged in any way
 ye bardaashat nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Like Shobhaa Dey, the story of the film has also raised questions on social media
 pakistan main siyaasi bavandar thamane kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 The Supreme Court of Pakistan has issued a notice of contempt against Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani and ordered to appear in court on January 19
 isse pehle atarni jaranal ne court se kaha tha ki abhi mujhe sarkaar kii ore se koi nirdesh nahin mila he isliye kuch or samay diya jaae
 The court gave him 20 minutes
 samay puraa hone ke baad jab jawaab nahin mila to court ne pradhanmantri gilaani ke khilaaf avmaananaa kaa notice jari kar 19 janvari ko hajir hone kaa aadesh diya
 If the contempt charge is proved true on Prime Minister Gilani, he can also be sentenced to 6 months in jail and expulsion from Parliament for 5 years
 is bich pakistan ke kanoon mantri pradhanmantri gilaani se milane pahunch gaye hai
 During this, the Law Minister told the journalists that whatever is right in the eyes of the law will be done
 pakistani raajnneetik itihaas main isse pehle 1998 main navaj sharif ko aisa hi ek notice mila tha
 At that time all this was submerged and there was a revolt against the Chief Justice

 It has to be seen what the government does now after the decision of the Supreme Court
 shabdon kaa safanjit vadnerkarrajakmal prakaashan,nai dilli-2,keemtah 600 ru
 Rapid development of the national language Hindi and that too without government crutches, is a reality in the era of liberalization
 media, film, vigyaapan hi nahin, sahitya or bhashaa ke anek kshetron main ummid se zyada teji se vikaas hua he
 In the last two decades, not a dozen advertising campaigns have been run in English
 tivi main angreji or hindi (tathaa anya pramukh bhashaayi) channelon kii reating main jameen-aasmaan kaa fark he
 But there are also people who are upset to see anarchy, discipline and inferiority in this age of Hindi
 un jaise logon kii shikayaton kaa jawaab agar is daur ke shuru main rishiyon jaise tap ke saath samaantar kosh banaakar varisht patrkaar arvind kumaar or unki jeevansangini kusum kumaar ne diya to abhi-abhi prakashit yuva patrkaar ajit vadnerkar kii kitaab shabdon kaa safar bhi hindi kii ek badi kami ko puraa karti he
 Now Bhale Ajit's Guru Dr
 suresh verma kaa ise vishwakosh banane kaa daawa atirikt shishy sneh main kahi baat lage par yah hindi bhashaa or kosh nirmaan ke kaam main damdaar dakhal to he hi
 The book of Ajit is declared to be the details of the search for the birth sources of the verses prevalent in Hindi
 yah kaam vaise bhi kaaphi dilachasp he par ajit ne isamen thode mjedaar sheershak, rochak style or dilachasp shabdon kaa chayan karke khaasi jaan daal di he
 Turning the shell is usually a boring task
 460 prishthon kii is kitaab ke saath aisa nahin hota
 You come on one word after another and go on the journey of development of language and culture along with them
 kai baar lekhak ne yah rochak tarika chhodkar gyaan kosh banane vaala prayaas bhi kiya he
 But he immediately explains their limits
 ajit utsuk patrkaar hai or isi utsukata main shabdon ke safar par nikle hai
 He writes a column in a newspaper with the same name, runs a blog on the Internet
 khud kii patrakarita or in charchit niyamit kaamon se unke paas na sirf har kshetra ke shabdon ko chunane, charchaa karne kaa vikalp mil gaya he balki stambh or blog par hui charchaaon kaa laabh bhi mila he
 That is why the book has become very interesting
 lekin jo lekhak beete kai varshon se shabdon ke safar ko apana mukhya kaam banaae hue hai vah is dauraan bhashaa shaastra, vyakaran or kosh nirmaan kii ekadam buniyadi padhai se bhi bachaa rahe, yah hairaani hoti he
 The author, who has worked on preparing such a huge book and planning the entire series, says that "if my effort is not tied to the rules of philology and etymology", what else would it be called irony
 patrakaari sajagata mahatvapurn he par jab aap kosh nirmaan, bhashaa or vyutpatti ke kaamon main is str par aate hai to aapako buniyadi 'upkarnon' kaa gyaan jaruri he
 But it seems that the author has not read the 60-65 pages basic booklet of Sanskrit grammar like 'small Principle Kaumudi'
 in kamiyon se baaki jo napha-nuksaan hua ho, yah kitaab clasik banane kaa asar chook gai lagati he
 The author has picked up a bunch of words according to the size and type of the newspaper column and has often derived the words in interesting ways
 par kai jagah ve zyada hi hawaii kalpanaaon ke aadhaar par nishkarsh nikaalte hai to kai jagah sandhi, utsarg or pratyay kii samaj main gadabad karte hai
 Many times the original word (or metal) is not in their grip, especially in the context of Urdu, Persian and Arabic words, while in the pure Hindi, the urdu-hindi dictionary of Maddah is able to help them to a great extent
 maddah jaise mukammil shabdkosh kam hi bane hai
 Ajit seems more 'sanskritist' than needed
 yah bhi ki unhone shabdon kaa boliyon or anya desi bhashaaon se rishta dekhne-samajhne par bahut kam dhyaan diya he
 Probably due to the availability of more content about the languages and words of Europe and Arab world on the Internet, their trend has gone up
 in kamiyon ke baavjood yah kitaab hindi bhashaa main nai jameen todatii he or yuva ajit yah ummid jagaate hai ki ve abhi is safar ke kai padaav tak jaaenge or dhire-dhire un galatiyon se ubarte jaaenge jo pehle padaav tak main dikhti hai

 With the decision to divide Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir without effect and divide the state into 2 parts, the Narendra Modi government has pushed the opposition parties on the backfoot
 modi ke is master stroke se haryana, jharkhand or maharashtra ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko jabardast siyaasi phayda milane kii sambhaavna dikh rahi he
 It is believed that the BJP will present this issue as its biggest achievement in the elections in these three states
 haryana, jharkhand or maharashtra main oktober main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Buoyed by the general election victory, the BJP has already set a target of winning Mission-75 in Haryana, Target-65 in Jharkhand and 220 plus seats in Maharashtra
 aise main teen rajyon ke chunaav se pehle bijepi ne jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 ko asarhin karke bada daanv chalaa he
 Explain that in the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had strongly raised the issue of air strike and nationalism
 iskaa bijepi ko jabardast siyaasi phayda mila
 The result was that Narendra Modi-led BJP won a big victory in 2019 over 2014
 aise main saaf he ki aagaamee teen rajyon main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main dhara 370 ko khatm karne ke faisle ko bijepi ek majboot hathiyaar ke taur par istemaal kar sakati he, kyonki party shuru se hi is khatm karne kaa sankalp le rakhaa tha
 Anand Rana, who has a close look at the politics of Haryana, says that every village and almost every family in Haryana is associated with some army or police
 desh ke liye sabase zyada shahid hone vaale faujee haryana se hai
 In such a situation, the BJP is expected to get political advantage in Haryana with the decision of removing Section 370 from Jammu and Kashmir
 rana kehete hai ki haryana main dharmik rujhaan bahut zyada rahaa he
 This is the reason that Ram temple and Mandal movement also could not affect the politics of the state
 haryana ke log bhavnatmak rup se rashtrawaad se jude hue hai, aise main jammu-kashmir se dhara 370 ko khatm karne or rajya ko 2 hisson main baantne kaa faisla kar bijepi ne pradesh main apane siyaasi graph ko or bhi badha liya he
 This is the reason why Haryana Congress leader Deepender Hooda is welcoming the decision to move 370 from the party line to make it ineffective
 hooda ne twit karte likhaa he, 'meri vyatigat raay rahi he ki 21veen sadi main anuchhed 370 kaa auchity nahin he or isko hatana chahie
 This is not only for the integrity of the country, but also in the interest of Jammu and Kashmir, which is an integral part of our country
 ab sarkaar kii yah jimmedaari he kii iskaa kriyanvayan shanti va vishwaas ke vaataavaran main ho
 Anand Rana used to say that Dipendra Hooda understands the politics of Haryana very well, that is why he is supporting the removal of Article 370
 hooda agar virodh karenge to jo raajnneetik aadhaar bachaa hua he, wo bhi khatm ho jaaegi
 That is why their compulsion to support
 haryana kii tarah hi maharashtra or jharkhand kii mitti main rashtrawaad se logon kaa bhavnatmak judaav he
 The political base of Shiv Sena, a BJP ally in Maharashtra, has been around Hinduism and nationalism
 aise main kashmir se dhara 370 ko hataane or jammu-kashmir ko 2 rajyon main baantne ke nirnay ko bijepi ke saath-saath shivasena bhi aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main uthaa sakati he
 The Congress is already battling factionalism in Maharashtra and Jharkhand
 maharashtra main congress or uske sahyogi ensipi ke vidhayak apana raajnneetik vajood bachaane ke liye bijepi or shivasena kaa daaman tham rahe hai
 At the same time, in Jharkhand, instead of fighting with the Congress, the leaders of Congress are engaged in muttering heads
 vipaksh puri tarah se bikharaa hua he
 Amidst all this, by taking the decision to remove Section 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, it has taken a big lead

 Students union president of Delhi University (DU) Ramlal Anand College (22) Utkarsh Sharma committed suicide by hanging himself
 police ke mutabik buudhvaar raat utkarsh ke bhai ne jaankaree di ki nanakpura main utkarsh ne aatmahatya kar lee he
 Police reached the spot and saw that Utkarsh had hanged himself
 utkarsh ke bhai ne bataaya ki unke pita or parivaar kii duusare sadsy upi gaye the
 When the father called Utkarsh at night, he did not pick up the phone
 uske baad pita ne use (utkarsh ke chote bhai) ko phone kiya
 He told that when he reached Nanakpura from Palam, Utkarsh died
 police ne bataaya ki maukey se koi suicide note baraamad nahin hua he
 Utkarsh was doing his BA from Political Science at Ramlal Anand College and was in the third year
 police ne shav ko postmortem ke liye bhej diya or maamle kii jaanch main juty he
 Let us know that recently, a student was sued in the hostel of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU)
 aatmahatya karne vaale chaatr kaa naam rishi thomas tha or vah mahi mandavi bvoij hostel main rahata tha
 He gave his life by hanging from the fan in the common area of the library
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath mangalvaar ko meerut ke daure par the
 During this time he went to the Aughdnath temple built in the cantt area and offered prayers there
 mandir main bane ek kune ke paas jaakar unhone shaheedon ko shradhanjali arpit kii
 This temple of Lord Shiva in Meerut is known by the name of Kali Paltan Temple
 or jis kuen ke paas jaakar yogi ne shaheedon ko pushpanjali arpit kii uskaa bhi bahut mahatvapurn itihaas he
 The revolution of 1857 actually started from this well
 meerut kii aitihaasik chhavneebat dedh sau saal se bhi zyada puraani he
 Then there was British rule in India and this area of meerut was the cantonment area where the soldiers barracks were built
 chhavnee main angrej or bhartiya donon senaaon ke log alag-alag jagahon par rahete the
 The British called the platoon of Indian soldiers a black platoon
 kaali palaton barrack ke paas hi ek chota sa shiv mandir tha jahaan par bhartiya sainik puja paath karne jate the
 There was also a well attached to this temple where the piyu was made
 mandir ke peeche hi vah jagah thi jahaan par chandmari yani nishanebaaji hoti thi aurasainik goli chalaane kaa abhyaas karte the
 There was also a market for Indian soldiers, which was called Lal Kurti Bazaar
 laal kurti bazaar naam isliye padaa tha kyonki angrejon ke samay bhartiya sainik laal rang kii choti kurti jaisi shart pahante the
 The area of lal Kurti in Meerut is still the same
 sainik vidroh kii shuruyatbaat 10 may 1857 kii he
 Some soldiers went to the temple to drink water
 pyau par us samay mandir ke pujari baithe hue the
 The soldiers, as usual, asked the priest to feed them
 lekin pujari ne sainikon ko apane haath se pani pilaane se inkaar kar diya
 When asked the reason, the priest said that soldiers who open cartridges made of cow and pig fat with their mouths cannot drink water with their hands because they are religious people who worship
 bhartiya sainikon ko yah baat behad chubh gai
 They have decided or whatever happens now, they will not face the cartoons
 darasal us samay sainikon ko apni bandook main istemaal karne ke liye jo kaartoos die jate the use pehle daanton se katkar tab bandook main lagaana padataa tha
 It was said that cow and pig fat was used to make these cartridges
 isi kaartoos ko lekar maheene bhar pehle bengal ke barrackpore main mangal pandey vidroh kar chuke the or yah baat chaaron taraf fail chuki thi
 The first battle of independence was Sunday, 10 May 1857
 us din bahut se angrej officer chuttee par the or paas ke hi carch main gaye hue the
 At the time of shooting that day, when the turn came to open the cartridge, the Indian soldiers refused to do so
 isi baat par angrejo se unka jhagada ho gaya
 Indian soldiers killed three British officers there
 uske baad yah baat aaj kii taraf fail gai or baaki bhartiya sainik bhi apane-apane baiyrakon se baahar nikal aae or angrejon par hamalaa bol diya
 Together these people attacked the church and killed many British there
 baad main in bhartiya sainikon ke saath aam log bhi shaamil ho gaye or meerut par bhartiya sainikon kaa kabja ho gaya
 Soon this spark of rebellion spread to the surrounding areas and the mutiny of 1857 had begun which is called the first battle of Indian independence
 1857 kii kranti se bharat ko aazaadee to nahin mili lekin azaadi kii ladaai ke liye behad majboot neenv jarur pad gai
 The small temple of Kali Paltan has been replaced by a grand temple and this well has also been covered and turned into a martyr memorial where people come to pay tribute to the martyrs
 kai baar 10 may ko angrejon ke parivaar ke log bhi yahaan par aate hai jinke purvajon kii maut 1857 ke gadar main hui thi
 Since 1857, the city of Meerut has expanded a lot, but this area is still called Meerut Cantt and the area has a large cantonment of the Indian Army

 - input language bharat main raksha utpaadan ko protsaahan dene kii jarurat par koi do raay nahin ho sakati, lekin ise hasil karne kii ranneeti par kaaphi bahes hui he
 The UPA government gave it a place in the Defense Production Policy 2010 but it was not a credible strategy
 nai endie sarkaar ne swadeshi raksha utpaadan ko protsaahit karne kii jarurat par bal diya he
 It has raised the foreign direct investment limit from 26 per cent to 49 per cent
 jahaan kahin atyaadhunik praudyogiki tak pahunch sambhav ho, vahaan chuninda tareeke se 49 fisadi se zyada epadi kii bhi manjuuri di ja sakati he
 For such proposals with more than 49 per cent FDI, concession is given in the requirement that the management of the applicant company should be in the hands of an Indian
 nai shart yah laai gai he ki company ko utpaada dizin or vikaas ke kshetron main aatmanirbhar hona chahie
 These changes are welcome
 haalanki raksha utpaadan ke aadhaar ko shashakt karne kii samoochee ranneeti ke maamle main ab bhi kai khamiyaan maujuud hai
 In order to strengthen this, there are many important issues in the context of the wider ecosystem that will have to be addressed at the level of policy making
 raksha kharid pranali (dipipi) ke antargat ‘mek’ in india kii shuruyaat abhi nahin ho saki he
 The Prime Minister's call for "make in India" from the ramparts of the Red Fort means that the process of "construction" under the DPP should be restored
 is prakriya main prototip dizin or vikaas kii keemat ko raksha mantralay or company 80:20 ke anupaat main saajha karenge
 India will retain the intellectual property rights of the weapon system and technology under "make in India"
 ab tak aisi sirf do pariyojnaayen jo shuru hui hai, future infentry combat vehical (exysivi) or tectical communication system (tisies), donon kii pragati bahut maddhim he
 The experience of these two projects indicates that the Ministry of Defense and Military Forces Headquarters lack the capability and capability to complete such projects in a timely manner
 ‘‘mek’’ in india kii 20 se 25 pariyojnaon ko aarambh kiye jane kii jarurat he taaki bhartiya raksha utpaadan ke samooche paristhitikeetantr main nai jaan daali ja sake
 For this purpose, feasibility reports will need to be issued by the Integrated Defense Staff (IDS) against projects identified under Long Term Integrated Perspective Planning (LTIPP) in the period 2012-2027
 raksha mantralay main niyojan kii prakriya kamjor he or use shashakt banaae jane kii jarurat he
 LTIPP 2012-2027 is essentially a list of some project concepts, weapon systems and technologies that military forces require to meet its strategic objectives and challenges and has no relationship with budgetary allocation for capital expenditure
 altiipipi 2012-2027 ko shashakt karne ke liye 15 varsh kii samyavadhi main yojana lakshyon or uplabdh sansadhano ke bich ek spasht sampark sthapit karne kii jarurat he jisamen altiipipi ko suraksha par cabinet samiti se manjuuri mil sake
 To cope with emerging geo-strategic challenges, serious capacity enhancement of forces is possible only through resource-based planning
 iske alaava bharat kaa raksha bajet bhi jidipi kaa 0
 75 per cent needs to be increased
 raksha utpaadan main epadi ko bhale hi badha diya gaya he, lekin ek pahalu jisaki akasar upeksha kar di jaati he vah yah he ki moulik raksha upkarnon ke vaishvik nirmaataa (oiem) apni matra sarkaron kii manjuuri ke bagaiyr praudyogiki hastantaran karne kii sthiti main nahin hote
 That is why under the FDI policy, enterprise-level relations will need to be retrospectively supported by diplomatic relations between governments
 aisa karne ke liye deshon or mahadwipon ke paas kai kism ke vikalp maujuud hai or inke bich ke paraspar intjaam ko is bahudhruviya vishwa main ranneetik uddeshyon se sanchalit hona hoga
 India has opted for repeated purchases from defense manufacturing psus where its ethical accountability, risks and threats are reduced because these companies are government-owned
 is model se nijaat paanaa hi ahm chunauti he taaki bharat ke nijee kshetra ko raksha utpaadan main utarane ko protsaahit kiya ja sake
 In the absence of pricing through competitive bids, the only option remains price enhancement in the price
 iske liye nijee or sarkari companiyon ke mulya dhaanche kaa gaharaa vishleshan karnaa jaruri ho jaataa he
 If the private sector is to be encouraged to manufacture complex equipment such as submarines, then we have to find an alternative to the competitive bidding system to deliver projects to them
 kelkar samiti ne 2005 main sifarish kii thi ki nijee kshetra kii companiyon ko rashtriya champion qaraar diya jaae or unhen raksha project saunpe jaaen
 The Ministry of Defense could not proceed on this proposal
 agar desh ko nijee kshetra main raksha utpaadan kaa shashakt aadhaar taiyaar karnaa he to is gatirodh ko toduya hoga
 It is not possible that the country continues to manufacture indigenous at high prices which are not competitive globally
 bataaya jaataa he ki sukhoi esayu-30emkei ke desi utpaadan kii keemat rus se puri tarah taiyaar aisa vimaan aayaat karne ke mukaable kahin zyada padati he
 Defense manufacturing companies and ordnance factories have maintained such a high-priced structure that whenever they get competition from the private sector, they will be weakened
 chunki vaishvik pratispardhaa kii asli kasuti niryaat he, lihaaja raksha vinirmaan aadhaar kaa niryatonmukhi hona samoochee ranneeti kaa aavashyak ang hona chahie
 Apart from this, the flow of technology and orders from the public sector to the private sector is also an important requirement under the "buy and make" system
 haal hi main oro ke bede ko badalane ke liye raksha mantralay dwaara oiem ke haath main bharat se nijee company ko chunane kaa adhikaar diya janaa ek swaagatyogy kadam he
 Such decisions will help resolve the deep penetration of public sector undertakings in the Indian defense system and give an opportunity to India's private sector to grow
 pichley 13 varsh ke anubhav is maamle main dhundhale rahe hai or bharat ke nijee kshetra main raksha utpaadan ab bhi maamuli bana hua he
 If the country is to be transformed into a credible military-industrial establishment, a strategic vision and direction will need to be given
 yah desh aaj kii taarikh main pichley dashak kii raftaar se peeche khisakna manjuur nahin kar saktaa

 amit shah ke ek desh, ek bhashaa ke paigaam par dangaldakshin bharat ke netaaon ne buland kiya virodhowaisi bole, hindi or hindutv se bhi bada he bharatgrih mantri amit shah ke ek desh, ek bhashaa ke paigaam par siyaasi dangal chhid gaya he
 Home Minister Amit Shah gave a call for Hindi
 unhone kaha ki hamaare paas ek aisi bhashaa ho jo vishwa patal par angreji ko parrast kar sake, isliye hamen koshish kerani chahie ki zyada se zyada hindi kaa prayog karen
 But this call of Shah created a ruckus in politics
 vipaksh ne aarope lagaaya ki modi sarkaar desh par hindi ko thope rahi he
 Several leaders from West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to AIMIM Chief Asaduddin Owaisi protested against Shah's statement
 asaduddin ovaisi ne kaha ki hindi, hindu or hindutv se kahin bada he bharat
 He said, 'hindi is not the mother tongue of every Indian
 kya aap is desh kii kai maatrubhaashaen hone kii vividhta or khubsuurati kii prashansa karne kii koshish karenge
 Not only this, he further said that Article 29 of the constitution gives every Indian the right to their own separate language and culture
 asaduddin ovaisi ne shah ke bayaan ko sire se khaarij kar diya, magar akele ovaisi hi nahin, vipaksh ne amit shah ke bayaan kaa sira ye kahkar ki shah ek desh ek kanoon ek desh ek vidhaan, ek desh ek pahchaan or ek desh ek bhashaa ke naam par bharat kii sabase khubasurat pahchaan yaheen kii vividhta kii jad khatm kar rahe hai, nai siyasat kii ore mode diya
 Protests started in the south
 bengalooru main kannada samarthakon ne joardaar virodh pradarshan kiya to kalburgi main karnataka navnirmaan sena ne bhi joardaar pradarshan kiya
 The DMK and MDMK also pulled up the political shamsheer to protest Shah's statement
 idhar congress hindi ko badhaava dene kii to baat kar rahi he, magar is baat kii ashanka bhi vyakt kar rahi he ki kshetreey bhashaaon ko maanane waalon ke manobhaav kaa bhi sammaan hona chahie
 Salman Khurshid said that if we want to apply the same language, then it is possible that people do not accept this, and cracks started
 vahiin, amit shah ne jo kaha uskaa jediu ne apane andaaj main samarthan kiya
 JDU leader KC Tyagi said that we do not want to impose Hindi but want to increase its acceptance
 Hindi isn't every Indian's "mother tongue"
 Could you try appreciating the diversity & beauty of the many mother tongues that dot this land? Article 29 gives every Indian the right to a distinct language, script & culture
 India's much bigger than Hindi, Hindu, Hindutvahttps: / / t
 co / ymvjnlayry — Asaduddin Owaisi (@asadowaisi) September 14, 2019 Mamta Banerjee tweeted, 'heartiest greetings to all of you on Hindi Day
 hamen sabhi bhashaaon or samskritiyon kaa samaan rup se sammaan karnaa chahie
 We can learn many languages but we should never forget our mother tongue
 'hindi diwas par aap sabhi ko hardik shubhakamanaayen
 We should respect all languages and cultures equally
 ham kai bhashaayen sikh sakate hai lekin hamen apni matra-bhashaa ko kabhi nahin bhoolanaa chahie— Mamata Banerjee (@mamataofficial)september 14, 2019vahiin, stallin ne shah ne bayaan waapas lene kii baat kahi
 DMK President MK Stalin said, 'we are constantly opposing the imposition of Hindi
 shah dwaara kii gai tippanee se hamen aghat pahunchaa he, yah bharat kii ekta ko prabhavit karegaa
 We demand that the statement be withdrawn
 ' stallin ne is mudde ko aage bhi uthaate rahane kii baat kahi
 Did Amit Shah say that there was a ruckus? Actually, the Home Minister said that there should be one language of the whole country, Hindi should be expanded
 agar rajbhasha khatm hoti he to iskaa asar hamaari samskruti par padegaa
 Therefore, it will have to be constantly improved
 unhone kaha ki aazaadee ke andolan se hindi ko nikaal den to andolan kaa astitv hi khatm ho jayega

 The bill which the Congress party passes in the Lok Sabha, stops in the Rajya Sabha after Rahul Gandhi comes from outside, this is his style

 In the Rajya Sabha, the Opposition surrounded Foreign Minister SM Krishna about the remarks made about Pillai and questioned why Krishna was silent when Qureshi was commenting about Pillai in Islamabad
 rajyasabha main prashnkaal ke dauraan bhaajapa ke upanetaa es es ahaluwalia ne sawaal kiya ki haal main islamabad main unke saath sanyukt samvaadadaata sammelan main jab kuraishi pillai or aatankwaadi sargana hafiz mohammad said ko ek hi taraazoo main rakhkar tippanee kar rahe the tab krishna kyon chup the or phir unhone bharat aane ke baad bhi pillai kaa bachaav kyon nahin kiya
 When Krishna's unequivocal reply to this, senior BJP leader m Venkaiah Naidu expressed dissatisfaction, he said, "when a comment like this (comparing Pillai's Saeed) is responsible for a" good neighbor "like Pakistan
 If the Foreign Minister was doing, i did not want to get into such mild debate
 mere vichaar se is tarah kii tulana betuki thi
 It was not right to react to it by adopting the same tone
 unhone kaha, ‘‘thimpu main bharat or pakistan ke pradhanmantri ke bich hui baithak main yah tay kiya gaya tha ki donon deshon ke bich vishwaas kii kami ko dur karne ke makasad se kadam uthaaye jaayenge

 muslimon ke sabase bade tyohaar id se pehle ek sandesh ne soshal media par halchal machaa di
 The message claimed that the West Bengal government, taking unprecedented steps, extended the Eid holidays to four days
 iske myne ye he ki pashchim bengal main sabhi daftar 12 se 17 june tak band rahenge
 The festival of Eid will probably take place on Saturday, 16 June
 17 june ko ravivaar he
 Reports to this effect were also seen on several local Bangla newspapers and regional TV channels
 pashchim bengal kaa naam pichley kuch arse se hinsak ghatnaon or gutiy sangharsh ko lekar surkhiyon main aata rahaa he
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has also faced criticism from opponents for such incidents
 aise main id par chaar din kii chhuttiyon vaala sandesh soshal media par bahes kaa mudda ban gaya
 Several people, including some senior IAS officers, reacted sharply to this
 chhuttiyon vaali ye adhisuchana kathith taur par pashchim bengal ke vitt vibhaag kii audit branch kii ore se 8 june kii chitthee ke jariye jari kii gai
 It reads- 'to celebrate the Eid festival in a proper manner, which is between 12 to 15 June 2018, the Governor is happy to declare a government holiday from 12 to 15 June, in addition to the already public holiday on 16 June 2018 Has been notified uparokt chitthee ke aadhaar par sandeshon ko jab soshal media par dhadadhad share kiya jane laga to kolkata police harakat main ai
 Kolkata Police tweeted this letter on June 10 as fake
 aise main sawaal uthaa ki kyamamta banerjisarkaar ne soshal media par tool pakadaney ke baad chhuttiyon ke aadesh ko waapas liya yaa phir kisi durbhaavna ke tahat farji chitthee ko soshal media par failaayaa gaya? hamane chitthee se judi sachai kaa pataa lagane ke liye tah tak jane kaa faisla kiya
 Last year, the Mamta Banerjee government had banned the immersion of Durga idols for a few hours due to a date with Muharram
 lekin kalakatta hoicourt ke sakht rukh apnaane ke baad rajya sarkaar ko apana aadesh waapas lenaa padaa tha
 While the High Court reprimanded the government for prohibiting the immersion of idols, it ordered to make adequate security arrangements for both occasions
 us vakt mamata banerjee ke virodhiyon ne un par aarope lagaaya ki wo vot bank raajnneeti ke liye alpsankhyakon ke tushtikaran kii koshish kar rahi hai
 Initially it seemed doubtful what the Finance Department had to do with the announcement of public holiday for the entire state
 lekin jab hamane padtaal kii to pataa chalaa ki 1957 se hi pashchim bengal main saarvajanik chhuttiyon kii ghoshnaa kaa kaam vitt vibhaag kii audit branch ke hi jimme rahaa he
 Many more such orders related to public holidays can also be seen on the website of the Finance Department
 id kii chhuttiyon ko lekar sambandhit chitthee vaastavik lagi
 Where the logo of the state government 'biswa-bangla' appeared on it
 vahiin rajyapal ke hawaale ke saath atirikt vitt sachiv rajasekhar bandopadhyaay ke hastakshar bhi dikhe
 But when talked to Bandopadhyay in this regard, he made it clear that it was not his signature
 unhone saath hi bataaya ki ve vitt vibhaag ke rajasav anubhag main karyrat hai jiskaa saarvajanik chhuttiyaan ghoshit karne se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 This is done by the audit branch of the Finance Department
 ’ye bhi dekha gaya ki ‘biswa-bangla’ vaala rajya sarkaar kaa logo niyamit circular yaa aadesh main kabhi istemaal nahin kiya jaataa
 This also applies to the notification of holidays
 agar ham farji adhisuchana kii tulana sarkari websites par maujuud kisi vaastavik adhisuchana se karen to or bhi kai gadabadi dekhi gai
 Notifications issued by the Finance Department always have a letter number which starts with 'F' which means Finance
 farji chitthee main aisa nahin tha
 The Kolkata Police is filing a complaint and is investigating who may be behind the fake letter and what was the motive behind doing so
 yahaan ye jaananaa dilachasp he ki id par aisi hi paanch chhuttiyon vaali farji chitthee pakistan main bhi saamne aane kii khabar he
 This letter dated 8 June also created confusion in Pakistan
 pakistan kejio newjane is chitthee ko farji bataate hue report prakashit kii
 Apart from this, Mamata Banerjee is also on target due to another fake news
 soshal media par ye farji khabar ab bhi circulet ho rahi he
 It claimed that an advertisement for a vacancy has been issued by the state government, stating that the applicants should be Muslim only
 sarkari naukariyon main ‘muslimon ke liye aarakshan’ ko soshal media par dobaaraa hilite kiya gaya jisase ki mamata banerjee sarkaar ke kathith alpsankhyak tushtikaran ko jaahir kiya ja sake
 But a closer look at the advertisement suggests that the vacancy was for Kolkata Municipal Corporation
 saath hi ye rikti muslim berial (dafnaanaa) board department se sambandhit thi
 According to the Calcutta Berry Board Act, 1889, this post has been reserved for Muslims for the last 129 years
 sambandhit pad ke liye muslimon ke liye aarakshan vastav main he lekin ise soshal media par galat dhang se prachaarit kiya gaya

 a video of Bollywood superstar Salman Khan is going viral these days
 pichley saal salmaan khan ne ek channel ko intervyuu diya tha
 In this interview, he said that if he had been in Chhindwara, he would have voted for Kamal Nath
 ab unka ye intervyuu soshal media par teji se viral ho rahaa he
 Let us know that recently Kamal Nath has been elected as the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh
 17 disambar ko wo bhopal ke laal parade maidan main mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lenge
 In the interview, Salman Khan said in response to a question, "I come from Mumbai (bandra)
 meraa sansadeey kshetra bandra he
 MP and MLA are Priya Dutt and Baba Siddiqui
 main unhen vot karata hum
 They are my friends wo yahaan acha kaam kar rahe hai
 "further Salman says-" If i lived somewhere else, i would not see which party he was from
 mere liye aisa insaan ho jo mere sansadeey kshetra ke liye acha kaam kare
 Like if i talk about Chhindwara, i will vote for Kamal Nath
 agar main gondia main hum to prafull patel ko vot duungaa
 These are my friends ''bataa den kimadhya pradeshmen 230 siton main se congress ne 114 siton par jeet darj kii he
 After the result of the assembly elections on December 11, the Congress was in a tizzy with the CM position
 mukhyamantri pad ke liye kamalnath or jyotiraditya sindhiya ke naam kii sabase zyada charchaa thi
 Kamal Nath's name was stamped by Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 kamalnath madhya pradesh congress ke adhyaksh hai
 Talking about Wahansalman Khan, the actor will soon be seen working with Katrina Kaif in the film India
 film main jaiki shroff salmaan ke pita kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai
 The film is directed by Ali Abbas Zafar
 elahabaad main ek hi parivaar ke 5 logon kii zindagi khatm ho gai
 The head of the house is under suspicion
 mana ja rahaa he ki usne patni or apni teen betiyon kii hatya ke baad khudakushi kar lee
 But the biggest question is why the head of the house took such a big step
 haalanki pehali nazar main police ko lag rahaa he ki ghannelu jhagada hi is jaghanya hatyakand kii vajah bana
 Five dead bodies found in the house, when police entered a house in Peepal village in Dhumun Ganj area of allahabad, got shocked
 ghar ke andharlashembikhari padi thi
 One full five corpses were taken out
 ghar ke mukhiya manoj kii laash
 The corpse of his wife Shweta
 teen betiyon kii laash
 The death created such a massacre that the whole family died
 police ke saath aas-pados ke logon ke dimag main ek hi sawaal jhapatte maar rahaa he ki aakhir ye kyon hua
 How did it happen
 subah ghar se baahar gaya tha manojilake ke log bataate hai ki somvaar subah manoj ko aakhri baar baahar dekha gaya
 After that neither Manoj came out nor any member of his family
 padosiyon ko kuch khatka hua to police ko soochna di gai
 Police reached the spot
 ghar kaa darwaja tod kar andar daakhil hui to manzar hilaa dene vaala tha
 The contents of the corpses were scattered all around in the fridge, cupboards and boxes
 manoj kii laash pankhe se latak rahi thi
 Wife Shweta's body was in the fridge
 almaari main 8 saal kii priti kii laash
 3-year-old Shreya's corpse was kept in a box
 jabaki 6 saal kii shivani laash bistar par padi thi
 No one came and went in the house, this news of ending the whole family together spread like fire in the forest
 logon kii bheed ghaki ke aas-paas jamaa ho gai
 SSP and ADG also reached the spot
 pehali nazar main police ko kisi ke andar daakhil hone or baahar jane kaa koi saboot nahin mila he
 The head of the house was murdered, then it was being hanged that Manoj, the head of the house, killed everyone first and then committed suicide
 police ko shaq he ki sabko galaa dabaa kar maaraa gaya he
 However, the motive for this heinous murder is not yet clear
 police pratham drushtya gharelu jhagade ko hatyakand kii vajah maan rahi he
 Anything else not true of this massacre? The police is investigating every aspect in the investigation
 laashon ko postmortem ke liye bhej diya gaya
 The question is that if Manoj had to commit suicide, why did he try to hide the corpse of his wife and 2 pieces in the fridge, cupboard and box
 kya wo laash ko thikaane laga kar saboot mitaane or bachane kii firaaq main tha
 Or it could be the truth of this sensational murder case

 iske liye ab metro ne aantarik taur par apni jaanch padtaal shuru kar di he
 Tuesday's technical fault was caused by a signaling problem
 metro kii blue line par ek blaak main metro kii automatic signling pranali ne kaam karnaa band kar diya
 Due to this, the metro had to run at a slow speed on the basis of manual system, but the effect of this was that one metro got late and the entire trek circuit got jammed
 blue line ek vyast line he or yahaan peak avars main phul frequency par metro train chalaai jaati hai, aise main agar das minutes ke liye bhi metro ke kisi hisse main kharabi aati he, to iskaa asar puri line par dikhne lagata he
 Significantly, the start of 2017 itself was accompanied by technical problems for the metro
 janvari main teen aise maukey aae jab metro kii raftaar par brake lag gaya or musafiron ko dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 After this, Tuesday proved troublesome as soon as February began
 ab dmarsi baar-baar aa rahi takneekee kharabiyon par kaabo paane kaa daawa jarur kar rahi he, lekin metro main musafiron kii bheed ke dabaav ko dekhte hue chunauti aasaan nahin lagati

 dilli bijepi ke rashtriya mantri sardaar arapy singh ne samajasevi or arvind kejariwal ke purv sahyogi anna hajaare ko ek khulaa khat likhaa he
 In this letter, Singh has complained to Anna about Kejriwal
 unhone likhaa he ki kejariwal aaj jahaan pahunche hai, usamen anna ke andolan kaa bahut bada yogadan he
 In such a situation, when there are malfunctions in Kejriwal's government, Anna should also come up against him
 khat ke bare main baat karte hue arapy singh ne kaha, 'maine yah chitthee isliye likhi he taaki logon kaa bhram dur ho sake ki kejariwal ko abhi bhi anna kaa samarthan hasil he
 Kejriwal is no longer following the path shown by Anna
 ''party par ecchhatra raaj chaahate hai kejariwal'bijepi netaa ne anna ko likhe khat main india against karpshan or uske baad kejariwal keraajnneetik partibanane se lekar dilli main sarkaar banane tak kii ghatnaon kaa zikr kiya he
 In the letter, Anna is written that after forming the government in Delhi, Kejriwal distanced himself from Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan to rule the party unanimously
 siem ban ghotaalon kii andekhibijepi netaa ne likhaa he ki kejariwal ke vidhayakon par farjivade or dhokhadhadi ke aarope lage
 Not only this, after becoming CM, Kejriwal did not fulfill his promise of action against Sheila Dixit in a corruption case
 itnaa hi nahin, kejariwal khud kii sarkaar main bhi gadabadiyon ko ko andekha kar rahe hai
 He promoted corruption by suppressing the tanker scam report
 auto permit ghotaale or sienji ghotaale kaa zikr bhi is patr main kiya gaya he
 Advise Kejriwal Anna RP Singh has appealed that in view of all these facts and circumstances, Anna should once again come up against corruption and on the issue of maintaining political integrity
 anna hajaare se kejariwal ko naseehat dene kii maang bhi kii gai he, kyonki kejariwal anna ke sahare hi is mukaam tak pahunche hai
 This Article of the Constitution has become untouchable after the Bommai case
 is anuchhed ke tahat vishesh sthitiyon main centre sarkaar kisi rajya sarkaar ko barkhaast kar sakati he
 Even after the bitter experiences of the Emergency, the idea of ending this article or accepting it as inactive was never considered
 lekin pichley 20-25 varshon se samvidhan ke do mahatvapurn anuchhedon-355 or 356 ko bekaar or nishprayojan maan liya gaya he
 Not only did the governments escape the use of these articles, but even intellectuals shied away from talking about them after the state governments launched a planned massacre campaign against the minority community and dismantled the Constitution
 jab samvidhan kii shapath lekar bani sarkarein or samvidhan ke prati nishtha vyakt karne vaali partiyaan tathaa unke sanghathan puure samudaay ke khilaaf samuhik hatya kaa samarthan karne lagen to use kanoon ke shashan or samvidhan kii vyavastha kaa bhang karnaa maanakar anuchhed 356 lagu hona chahie
 Justice Markandey Katju has brought this important paragraph from the dead to a lively stage by sparking discussion
 unhone janata or buddhijiviyon kaa dhyaan is baat kii ore khinchaa he ki jo sarkarein kanoon ke shashan ko banaae rakhane main asamarth hoti hai, unhen anuchhed 356 ke antargat barkhaast kiya janaa chahie
 Katju is not an ordinary person
 ve swatantraaa senaanee parivaar main janme hai or supreme court ke nyaayadhish rah chuke hai evam bhartiya press parishad ke adhyaksh hai
 He is the author of various subjects and his judgments and writings inspire the reader to think and act
 samvidhan ke ye anuchhed sangheey vyavastha kii raksha ke antim aujaar hai or unhen niskriy banane kaa arth he sangheey vyavastha ko sankat main daalana
 This is to endanger the existence of the state of India formed after centuries
 sadiyon se hamaara itihaas aapas main ladgaye or raashtra ko khandit karne kaa rahaa he
 The federal system that we adopted after independence was not a federal system like the US
 america kii sangheey vyavastha swatantra rajyon ke mail se bani thi jabaki hamaari sangheey vyavastha centre dwaara nirmit he
 Atru, being state autonomous, is still under the discipline of the Center
 kanoon vyavastha ko banaae rakhane kaa kaam rajyon kaa he lekin yadi rajya usamen kotahi karte hai to centre ko sarkaar barkhaast karne or uskaa sara prabandh apane haath main lene kaa puraa adhikaar samvidhan ne diya he
 The biggest test of this article happened during the rule of the Janata Party when the central government sacked several state governments and conducted fresh elections there
 grih mantri chedhri charan singh ne tark diya ki loksabhaa ke chunaavon se aae baari parivartan ke anuroop yadi rajyon main parivartan nahin hua to kanoon vyavastha kii gambhir sthiti paidaa hogi
 The Supreme Court accepted this argument in the Rajasthan case and upheld the use of Article 356
 iske baad use duusari badi chunauti tab mili jab babari masjid ke giraae jane ke baad bhartiya janata party (bijepi) dwaara shasit sarkaron ko barkhaast kiya gaya
 All the parties, except the BJP, supported this action in the debate that took place in Parliament to approve the President's order
 lekin bijepi shasit rajya, madhya pradesh ke hycourt ne use samvidhan-virakt ghoshit kar diya
 The High Court's Chief Justice, while giving his verdict, argued that the decision of the Bench of the nine judges of the Rajasthan case was changed which was untenable
 jahaan rajasthan cese ke faisle main kaha gaya tha ki raashtrapati ke aadesh ko chunauti nahin di ja sakati, vahiin hycourt ke faisle main raashtrapati ke aadesh par kai bematlab sawaal uthaae gaye the
 a defamation case was filed against him by a lawyer after Madhu Limaye criticized the decision
 limaye ne iskaa swaagat kiya tha lekin is cese ko yah maanakar waapas liya gaya ki isamen dam nahin he
 However, the dispute was concluded by a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court in the Bommai case, which upheld the dismissal of BJP governments
 lekin is faisle ne anuchhed 356 se sambandhit raashtrapati ke aadesh ko ek nae vivaad kaa vishay bana diya
 It said that the court can review the circumstances related to the President's order
 yah puraa vivaad hi anargal tha karypalika or nyaaypalika ke bich adhikaron ke liye golak nath or keshavanand bharti keson se jo vivaad chhidaa tha, yah vivaad usee kaa parinaam tha
 The dispute moved beyond the decision of the Madhya Pradesh High Court and the Bommai case verdict stamped it out
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki kendriya sarkarein anuchhed 356 kaa prayog karne se bachane lageen balki aparadhbodh se grast sarkaron ko ek bahaanaa mil gaya jisase kanoon ke shashan kii dhajjiyaan udaane ke baad bhi ve is anuchhed ke prayog se batch saken
 This policy was for both the Congress and the BJP as both wanted to cover each other's stigma
 lekhak raamamanohar lohia rachanawali ke sampadak hai Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh said on Sunday that for the first time such a provision has been made in the Union Budget, which will benefit the farmers
 unhone kaha ki kaledhan ke khulaase par saadhe saat fisadi paisa kisaan kalyaan adhibhaar ke rup main dena hoga

 After the program, the Minister asked the Agriculture Minister who came to participate in the program of Indian Pulses Research Institute (IIPR) on Sunday afternoon that many rich people are working as farmers to make black money white
 isamen vijay maalya ke lichi ke baganon kaa bhi zikr aayaa
 Singh deferred the question of Mallya, but said, 'if you look at the budget of the Modi government, it is the budget of the village and the poor farmer, due to which the opposition has stopped speaking
 kaledhan vaala puunjipati kuch din to aaazaad gum saktaa he lekin jald hi vah kabje main aa jayega kyonki bajet main kaledhan ke liye itane kade praavdhaan kiye gaye hai
 Our government will take strong action against tax evaders irrespective of the way they have earned black money
 'virodhiyon kii bolti bandaradha mohan ne kaha ki jahaan tak kaledhan kaa sawaal he to pehali baar bajet main praavdhaan main kiya gaya he ki kaledhan ke khulaase par saadhe saat pratishtakisaan kalyaan sarchargedena hoga
 If this work was done earlier, the farmers would not have this situation
 jo paise vaale puunjipati log he ve kisi bhi rup main rahen sarkaar unke liye bahut kathor he
 It is not possible for them to keep black money hidden in the country
 krishi mantri ne kaha ki kaledhan vaale log dar rahe hai kyonki desh kaa pehla pradhanmantri aisa he, jisane garibi jheli he or uske raaj main kalaadhan rakhane vaala aadmi seenaa taan kar nahin chal saktaa

 Since then, Delhi Police has opened a front against Kejriwal
 jab kejariwal ne bayaan diya tha us samay dilli ke police kamishnar bies bassi the or unhone bayaan par aitraaj jataayaa tha
 He had said that it is humiliating if the Chief Minister makes such a statement

 Instead of introducing three new taxes, the Eastern MCD should work first on reforming under the collection of existing taxes
 unhen dilli ke vitt mantri shri manish sisodiya dwaara prastut ‘shunya’ kar bajet se kuch siikhnaa chahie
 While the Delhi government has reduced the tax burden on the people of Delhi, the bjp-led MCD is working to break the back of the people of Delhi by increasing taxes from time to time

 Neither can they clear the garbage nor can they manage the finances of corporations in the same manner

 On this subject, senior leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, Dilip Pandey said that “delhi Finance Minister Manish Sisodia is presenting zero tax budget of Delhi government, which is favorable to the public and this proves that Aam Aadmi Party is actually against BJP Know how to handle governance better
 bijepi ke logon ne nigam main shiksha ke naam par sampatti kar 5% badha diya he
 MCD has completely ruined education in Delhi and now property tax is being imposed which has already been collected
 bijepi waalon ko dilli ke vittamantri manish sisodiya or unke bajet se kuch siikhnaa chahie
 Reacting to this, Aam Aadmi Party MLA Anil Bajpai said, what has the BJP done for the good of the MCD? The first thing is that for the last many years, the BJP has not done any work while staying in the corporation and now increase taxes, why? If they do not know how to run the MCD, i advise them to hand over the Municipal Corporation to the Aam Aadmi Party
 ”purvi emsidi main netaa vipaksh or aam aadmi party ke parshad abdul rahamaan ne kaha ki “aam aadmi party ek aisi party he jo hameshaa janata ke adhikaron ke liye ladati he
 This budget of bjp-ruled municipal corporation is going to have a huge impact on the common man's pocket and we will protest against it, we demand that it be withdrawn immediately

 kendriya mantri uma bharti ne 'ajtak editors round teble' main unke mantralay ke kaamkaaj ke saath supreme court ke faisle par bhi sawaal kiya gaya
 On the question of criminal conspiracy case going on in Babri Masjid demolition case, Uma Bharti said that she does not know of any conspiracy
 uma bharti ne kaha ki vaade ke mutabik oktober 2018 tak ganga ko nirmal bana diya jayega, lekin ganga kii aviralata hasil karne main saat varsh or lag jaaenge
 She said that i am working according to the deadline

 But it will take time to restore the continuous stream of Ganga
 isamen saat varsh tak kaa samay lag saktaa he
 Uma said that Ganga was not an issue in the Lok Sabha elections-2014, but it was given a place in the BJP manifesto
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jab banaras main prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan ganga kaa mudda uthaaya, tab ye mudda bani
 On the issue of Namami Gange, Uma said that the level of cooperation with the former Akhilesh Yadav government of Uttar Pradesh was lacking but the new Chief Minister of the state, Yogi Adityanath, would support the Center as he understood the importance of Ganga well
 engiti ne haal hi main kaha tha ki ganga ek boond bhi saaf nahin hui he or ganga nirmaleekaran ke liye aavantit janata ke paise kaa sahi upyog nahin ho sakaa he, nyaayaadhikaran kii is tippanee ko lekar puche gaye sawaal ke jawaab main uma ne kaha ki jahaan jarurat nahin lagi, vahaan unhone ek paisa bhi kharch nahin kiya he
 Uma said that the amount of Rs 20 thousand crore allocated for the Namami Gange project is not going to lapse
 hamane abhi is yojana par kaam shuru hi kiya he or hamane galat jagah yaa jahaan jarurat nahin ho, vahaan ek paisa bhi nahin kharch kiya he
 What did Uma say? When Uma Bharti was asked if she was ready to give up the chair on the issue of Ram temple like the tricolor in Hubli, she did not answer the question
 unhone kaha ki ye tulana karnaa galat he
 He also said that i did not know if there was any conspiracy in the Babri Masjid demolition case
 uma ne kaha ki agar court main ye maamla khul jaae to mujhe bhi pataa lag jayega ki haa koi sajeesh hui thi
 Uma Bharti categorically denied the allegation of any conspiracy
 haalanki uma ne ye jarur kabuula ki wo ram mandir andolan main shaamil rahi hai
 But they did not know that there was any conspiracy in it
 congress ke kehane par nahin duungi istifouma bharti ne istife kii maang ko nakaar diya
 He said that i will not resign at the behest of Congress
 vahiin ram mandir par dobaaraa andolan main jane ke sawaal ko bhi unhone taal diya
 Let us tell you that the Supreme Court had recently ordered a criminal conspiracy case against several people including Uma Bharti, LK Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi in the Babri Masjid demolition case
 court ke us aadesh ke baad congress ne uma bharti se istife kii maang kii thi

 There has been a big disclosure on the mi-17-v5 accident that crashed in Arunachal Pradesh this month
 ajtak ko mila ek exclusive video haadase ko lekar nae tathyon kii ore ishaara karata he
 The question arises as to what negligence was responsible for the 7 jawans? In the exclusive video, Aaj Tak has revealed that the Russian helicopter had collapsed like mud
 6 oktober ko bhartiya vayusena kaa emai-17-ve5 helicopter apane routine mishan par udaan bhar rahaa tha, jo vaastavik niyantran rekha ke paas yangste post se bahut dur eendhan drop kar rahaa tha
 Explain that the Line of Actual Control is considered to be the border between India and China
 emai-17 haadase main 7 bhartiya jawan maare gaethe
 Aaj Tak has confirmed this video from senior officials of the Ministry of Defense
 video main dikh rahaa he ki helicopter kaa pichhlaa pankhaa eendhan giraae jane ke vakt container se takaraa gaya he
 After being damaged, the rear fan of the chopper immediately breaks apart and the helicopter remains in the air for a few seconds before crashing
 raksha mantralay ke sheersh adhikariyon ne ajtak ko bataaya ki haadase kii jaanch ke liye court of inquairi kaa gathan kiya gaya, jisane chaunkaane vaale tathyon se pardaa uthaaya, jo badi laaparvaahee kii ore ishaara karte hai
 As reported by Aaj Tak earlier that MI-17 had flown from Khirmu airfield, this airfield is maintained by the Indian Army and Indian Army personnel were working to fill and load kerosene oil jerrycans
 jaanch main is baat kaa khulaasa hua ki kerosene tel se bhare jericans ke parachutes ko acchhee tarah se baandha nahin gaya tha, jisaki vajah se haadasa hua
 Top sources told Aaj Tak that as seen in the video, Jerryman breaks away from the parachute and hits the rear fan of the helicopter
 iske baad helicopter apana santulan kho detaa he or aasmaan se ek pathar kii bhaanti girakar bikhar jaataa he
 The investigation also revealed that the fuel jerrycans should not have been in the helicopter
 jaanch se waakif raksha mantralay ke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya ki jericans ke handle bahut kamjor the or isaki vajah se parachute se baandhe jane ke baad tuutakar alag ho gaye
 a senior helicopter aware of the development said that 'there are clear standards to airdrop everything including fuel
 payalton ne iskaa paalan kiya or pichhlaa pankhaa kshatigrast ho jane ke baad bhi helicopter ko hawa main khadaa rakhane kii koshish kii
 In this case it should be seen how the jerrycans were loaded onto the aircraft
 ' unhone kaha ki jin logon ne jericans ko helicopter main lod kiya, unase is bare main poocha janaa chahie
 Let us tell you that these Russian-made Mi-17 helicopters were inducted into the Indian Air Force in the year 2013

 10 others from poisonous liquor have been admitted to KEM and Shatabdi hospitals in critical condition
 unhone kaha, 'police ne is maamle main ek raju langadaa ko giraftaar kar liya he, jabaki do anya kii talash jari he

 In the name of cheating the officers at the examination centers in the district, there is a heavy recovery from the students
 sutron ke mutabik, janapad ke kai pariksha kendron ko pehle hi jila prashasan kii ore se samvedansheel evam atisamvedansheeltaa kii suchi main shaamil karke unki karypranali par sawaal laga diya gaya, kyonki agar yahpariksha centre samvedan evam ati samvedansheeltaa kii sucheemen shaamil the to unhen pariksha centre banaaya hi kyon banaaya gaya
 Due to the problem of the examination centers being built, examination centers have also been made in such places, where the candidates are having to face the problem of vehicle facility
 haalanki aisi hi anekon samasyaon kaa khulaasa na karne kii shart par chaatro ko yah suvidha muhaiyaa karai gai
 Probably this is the reason why most of the examination centers in the district are not only being copied openly, but also illegal collection in the name of copying
 yahi kaaran he ki prashasan ke khauf se bekhauf hokar nakal mafia shashan ke aadesh ko hawa main uda rahe hai
 Not only this, the district is known to be fit for cheating, so students from non-provinces as well as non-provinces are also giving examinations here

 The story of the second season, Ganesh Gaitonde (nawazuddin Siddiqui) is seeking revenge from Inspector Parulkar and Isa
 usase milane ek ro agent kedy yadav pahunchati he jiske sahare gayatonde kenya main apana sramajya chalaane lagata he
 KD Yadav, with the help of Gaitonde somehow wants to capture Pakistan's dangerous terrorist Shahid Khan
 wo bharat main kai aatanki hamalon main shaamil rah chukaa he
 Gaitonde suffocates while working for KD Yadav and after meeting Guruji (pankaj Tripathi), Gaitonde's life course changes
 gayatonde ko guruuji ke saath ek aisa cosmik conection feel hota he jo use duniya main kisi insaan ke saath mahasoos nahin hota he
 The same politics started from Sacred Games 1 has now transcended the country to become international
 america kii aarthik mandi, middle east ke civil war, osama bin laden or 9 / 11 jaise kai prasang is baar shaamil kiye gaye hai
 Gaitonde leaves Kenya and goes to Guruji's asylum and forms part of one of his devastating projects in Croatia
 project satyuga ke is bhayankar yuddh main jahaan guruuji ke maargdarshan main kuch log ahan brahasmi kaa vichaar dimag par haaavee kiye hue hai vahi duusari taraf maujuud he tamaam galatiyon se bhari, hataash or niraashaa ye duniya
 On the other hand, Sartaj Singh (saif Ali Khan) learns that a nuclear attack is about to take place in Mumbai, ranging from influential leaders to police and IS
 wo apni team ke sahare is hamale ko rokane kii koshish karata he
 But does he save this world? The bigger question than that is, is this world worth saving? All the characters are strong
 Guruji's character is undeniably the most memorable character in Pankaj Tripathi's life
 ek hi samay par ye kairactor itnaa dark or satal he ki kahin-kahin pankaj bhi is kirdaar main jujhate dikhte hai
 a great spiritual master who is not born on earth but has descended
 jise is duniya ko lekar koi ummid nahin he
 He creates a secret spiritual cult group that wants to take this world from Kali Yuga to Satyuga
 satta, ahankaar, bhautikwaad se dur, ek aisi duniya se dur jahaan dharm, yuddh, mujeec, yahaan tak kii pyaar bhi kaarobaar ho chukaa he
 He believes that this world of captilism, arrogance and global warming is destroying itself inadvertently and Guruji is trying to become the catalyst for the end of the world only with the help of his group
 apni bees varshon kii mehnat ke baad ve ek kalgranth bhi taiyaar kar chuke hai jo logon ko satyuga main jeene kaa salika sikhayega
 This larger sample of mind control and spiritual terrorism has rarely been seen in a film before
 duusare sijan main kai seens aise hai jo aapako disturb bhi kar sakate hai
 For example, Nawazuddin's acting during 'pankajasan' between Guruji and Gaitonde surprises you as well
 is sijan main gauchi naamak drug ne bhi cinematography ko mauka diya he screen par jamkar rang bharne kaa
 From Sartaj to Gaitonde, he is seen struggling with his devils of the past on taking this drug, reminiscent of America's psychedelic culture in the 60s
 is drug kaa ye alokik culture kai sabhyataaon main failaa he jis par phir kabhi baat ho sakati he
 Nawazuddin Siddiqui has been typecast in the recent past and sometimes it happens that his performance is not surprising
 lekin secred games 2 dekhakar navaj ke aalochak bhi unke abhinay kii range ko dekhakar chaunkenge
 How Gaitonde, who is sitting in the yearning of revenge, seeks questions related to his existence and maintains his dominance in his constantly changing character
 bhagwaan banane ke baad bhi gayatonde kitna asurakshit he, ye use guruuji kii sharan main jaakar hi maaloom chalata he
 As a gangster, he finds a new life after his Igo Death, who finally realizes that he may not mean anything to the world, but how much he wants Bombay
 is siries ko dekhne ke baad vaaki ye ehsaas hoga ki anuraag kashyap ke liye navazuddin siddiki kuch bhi kar sakate hai
 At the same time, Saif Ali Khan is in fragile emotional conditions in the role of Sartaj
 ek aisa shaks jisaki jindagi se dhire dhire sab khatm hota ja rahaa he or jo anjaane main hi sahi sadhvi betya ke saath apane andruni jakhmon ko kuredta he
 Sartaj is trying his best to follow his father's ideals in this series
 siries ke climex main navazuddin or saf ali khan fite club ke edward norton or bread pit jaisaa kuch karishma kar jate hai
 The climax of this series is about to create a hue, which creates almost the same curiosity as Christopher Nolan's film Inception's Climax
 is sijan kii sabase shashakt mahila ke rup main kedy yadav (amrutha subhash) hai
 Subhash has been a trusted Marathi actress and Raman Raghav 2
 0 main navaj kii bahan ke kirdaar main apni acting se logon ko hairaan bhi kar chuki hai khaskar ve jis bebasii ke saath roti hai
 KD Yadav's role is so powerful that Gaitonde is not afraid of him but respects him
 philistini maa se paidaa hui kalki kii jindagi hi conflict yani dwandv se bhari hui he
 She has gone through such tragedies in her time that she is convinced that there is nothing worth saving in this world
 wo apni man kii shanti kai dagar gumti he or aakhirkaar uski yatra guruuji par aakar khatm hoti he
 An ultra-feminist woman whose intentions are innocent in her eyes, but dangerous for the world
 wo ek aise group kaa pratinidhitiv karti he jo apane aapako enlitand maanate hai or ek nai duniya ke nae uttaradhikari ke taur par apane aapako dekhte hai
 As Gaitonde's love interest, Jojo is also a depression-stricken woman who arrives in Mumbai with dreams of becoming an actress, but gives up hope of living after encountering the dark realty of Mayanagari
 navaj or jojo ke bich ke samvaad ek trygic lavastory jaise lagate he
 However, an expose of Jojo breaks Nawaz's heart
 banty kaa is sijan main khaas role nahin he
 However, his dialogues, spoken in his familiar style, can once again dominate social media
 lekin jaisaa ki gayatonde kahata he ki ye khel in sab chizon se bahut bada he
 In this season, Guruji's disciple Trivedi and Home Minister Bhonsle are the pawns of the corrupt system of this country who can turn the game into a king when the time comes
 mordan daur ke ye wo shaitan chehre hai jinamein rattibar bhi maanavtaa nahin bachi he
 You want to hate them and they are successful in getting them done with their brilliant performances
 inspector parulakar kaa kirdaar climex tak aate-aate apane liye tamaam samvednaa paidaa kara jaataa he
 These three are well-known actors and after this season, Bhosle and Parulkar can emerge as the new trusted characters of Bollywood
 sijan 1 kii tulana main maajid kii jindagi ke utaar-chadhaav ke chalate ye kerector bhi positive chhap chhod jaataa he
 When Majid, who is seen behind Parulkar in the first season, gives the real reason for doing this, then you realize that despite being in better condition in India, people have to sacrifice themselves due to their identity
 shahid khan or mailkam ke role main ranvir shouri or ljuk keni khoonkhaar lagate hai

 pichley do-teen dinon se news channelon par indrani mukherjee kii khabar chai hui he
 It is being shown as if Indrani has done some great work and her name is going to be recorded in history
 aisa lagata he ki indrani ne apane indrajaal main in channelon ko jakad liya he
 If you start watching this news seriously, then you will become serious yourself, to think that the news fuse is not happening? i do not say that Indrani Mukherjee's case is not news, but the manner in which this news is being shown is wrong
 badal-badal kar ek khabar ko baar-baar dikhaanaa khabar ke mahatva ko kam detaa he
 Anyway, it is wrong to present the personal life of any person in this way
 sabase dukh kii baat yahi he ki shina bora, jiskaa murder ho chukaa he, uske charitra ko lekar sawaal uthaanaa
 If Indrani has committed murder, then the law will surely punish him

 He is bored after watching the serious news
 ab usko news ke saath -saath manoranjan bhi chahie or news channel manoranjan ke centre banate ja rahe hai
 The more sensitive news that is showing is going down in ratings, its TRP is coming down
 tiarapy ke tension ne news kii paribhaasha badal di he
 It seems TRP does not mean "television rating point" but "tension rating point"
 tiarapy kii tension ne ek majboot news channel ko bhi majaboor kar rahaa he, aisi khabaren dikhaane ke liye, lekin sabko jimmedaar maananaa galat he
 Even today, there are many channels which are stuck to their principles
 vah news ko gambhirtha ko dekhte hue hi use dikhaa rahe hai
 i do not say that the media is not doing well, because of the media, many aspects are solved
 media apni saamaajik jimmedaari ko samajhate hue samaaj kii samasyaon ko bhi uthaata rahata he, lekin media ko vyakti kendrit nahin hona chahie
 It is wrong not to take other important news seriously for such a news

 kuch naatakeeyata or atiranjana ke saath kaarykram paroskar darshakon ko lubhaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Nowadays it is a daily story in news channels
 radhe maan se lekar aashaaram tak sab apane asar channelon par chhod gaye hai
 Looking at this form of media, it seems that the media is running away from its social responsibility
 is tarah kii khabar saamaajik khabar par baari padane lagi he
 The reach of the media has certainly expanded, but the future of this expansion has come into question
 sahar kii samasya se media avgat to he lekin gaanvon kii samasyaon se achoota najar aa rahaa he
 The comments is sabake liye sirf news channelon ko jimmedaar maananaa galat hoga
 Our audience has changed, its taste has also changed
 sanjeeda news dekh dekhakar vah bor ho gaya he
 Now he needs entertainment along with news and news channels are becoming centers of entertainment
 jo zyada sanjeeda news dikhaa rahaa he vah reating main neeche ja rahaa he, uski tiarapy kam aa rahi he
 trp's tensions have changed the definition of news
 aisa lagata he tiarapy kaa matlab "televijan reating point" nahin balki "tension reating point" he
 The tension of TRP is also forcing a strong news channel to show such news, but it is wrong to hold everyone responsible
 aaj bhi aise kai channel hai jo apane usulon par date hue hai
 He is showing the news only after seeing the seriousness of it
 main yah nahin kahata ki media acha kaam nahin kar rahaa he, media kii vajah se kai pahalu bhi sulajhe hai
 The media understands its social responsibility and keeps raising the problems of the society, but the media should not be person centered
 ek aisi khabar ke liye duusari mahatvapurn khabaron ko gambhirtha se na lenaa galat he
 a news should not be seen so much that the show itself comes in the news
 duusari taraf dikhne vaala dukhi ho jaae
 It would be wrong to hold news channels solely responsible for all this
 hamaara darshak badal gaya he, uskaa swaad bhi badal gaya he
 He is bored after watching the serious news
 ab usko news ke saath -saath manoranjan bhi chahie or news channel manoranjan ke centre banate ja rahe hai
 The more sensitive news that is showing is going down in ratings, its TRP is coming down
 tiarapy ke tension ne news kii paribhaasha badal di he
 It seems TRP does not mean "television rating point" but "tension rating point"
 tiarapy kii tension ne ek majboot news channel ko bhi majaboor kar rahaa he, aisi khabaren dikhaane ke liye, lekin sabko jimmedaar maananaa galat he
 Even today, there are many channels which are stuck to their principles
 vah news ko gambhirtha ko dekhte hue hi use dikhaa rahe hai
 i do not say that the media is not doing well, because of the media, many aspects are solved
 media apni saamaajik jimmedaari ko samajhate hue samaaj kii samasyaon ko bhi uthaata rahata he, lekin media ko vyakti kendrit nahin hona chahie
 It is wrong not to take other important news seriously for such a news
 ek khabar ko itnaa or aisa nahin dikhaanaa chahie ki dikhaane vaala khud khabar main aa jaae
 On the other hand, the look becomes sad
 main yah nahin kahata ki media acha kaam nahin kar rahaa he, media kii vajah se kai pahalu bhi sulajhe hai
 The media understands its social responsibility and keeps raising the problems of the society, but the media should not be person centered
 ek aisi khabar ke liye duusari mahatvapurn khabaron ko gambhirtha se na lenaa galat he
 a news should not be seen so much that the show itself comes in the news
 duusari taraf dikhne vaala dukhi ho jaae

 The Opposition is referring to it as a case of Dalit versus non-dalit, while Union Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani rejected it outright
 jabaki mantri ne apane bayaan main irani dalit shabd par jarurat se zyada jor bhi diya
 However, Prime Minister Modi, who has remained silent on the Dalit issue raised by the opposition till now, said in Varanasi that his government is committed to working for the welfare of Dalits, poor and the underprivileged

 Shahid Kapoor had said in an interview that he could do better than Ranveer Singh in the Padmavat role of Alauddin Khilji
 iske baad donon ke cold war kii khabaren aane lagi thim or kaha jane laga tha ki padmavat main ranvir kii zyada tarif hone ke kaaran shahid ko unase jalan hone lagi he
 However, during an interview, Shahid has said that he is satisfied with his character and he is not jealous of anyone
 shahid ne baatcheet ke dauraan kaha ki sanjay lila bhansaali film main unke jaise pratibhashali abhinayta ko hi rakhana chaahate the
 He did not work in the film because of any character but because Sanjay wanted to cast him in the film
 script padhane ke kaaphi pehle hi unhone film main kaam karne ko lekar hami bhar di thi
 shahid-meera's Oops Moment in LFW 2018, Dupatta further told that such a spoiled Shahid further said that Sanjay told him that he cannot make this film without him
 is film ke puraa hone ke liye unke jaise talented kalakaar kii sakht jarurat he
 According to Shahid, when one character is made more influential in a film, it becomes a little difficult for the rest of the cast to get equal attention from the audience, but they are not sorry for it

 rajasthan main vidhansabha chunaav ke rujhaan ke mutabik sattadhari bijepi or vipakshi congress main se kisi bhi dal ko bahumat milti nahin dikh rahi he
 The reason for this is that due to ticket cuts, rebels of both the parties stood in about 50 seats
 is prakaar jahaan rajya main mukhya muqabla do dalon ke bich hota he, aise main in siton par baagiyon ne muqabla rochak kar diya he
 This time in Rajasthan's 200-member assembly, voting was held on November 7 for 199 seats
 jisamen lagbhag paanch darjan siton par trikoniya or darjan bhar siton par chatushkoniya muqabla dekhne ko mil rahaa he

 The BJP is challenged in the form

 purv khel mantri sunil dutt ne kaha tha ki aayojan samiti kii kaman sarkaar kii ore se nominete kisi vyakti ko saunpa janaa chahie
 At the same time, Mani Shankar Aiyar criticized the committee for wasteful expenditure of money
 em es gil ne bhi kalmadi and company ke manamaane faisalon ko lekar sawaal uthaae the
 Former Union Minister P
 chidambaram shanivaar shaam ko pet dard kii shikaayat ke baad dilli sthit ames le jaaya gaya
 He was taken back after routine checkups and some tests
 aapaki jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki ienex media maamle main kapil sibbal ne court se anurodh kiya tha ki pi chidambaram ko ghar kaa khaanaa or ames main ilaaj karaane kii anumati di jaae
 The court allowed p Chidambaram to do so
 gauratlab heki sibiai ne chidambaram ko 21 agast ko jor baag sthit unke awaas se giraftaar kiya tha
 The CBI had on May 15, 2017 filed an FIR on May 15, 2017 over alleged irregularities in foreign investment promotion board sanctioning investment of Rs 305 crore to INX Media Group during the tenure of Chidambaram as finance minister
 purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh, jinke mantrimandal main chidambaram vitt mantri the, ne sawaal kiya he ki samuhik nirnay ke liye unhen kaise jimmedaar tehraaya ja saktaa he
 a dozen officials, including six government secretaries, had investigated and recommended the proposal
 chidambaram ne kaha, sarvasammati se sifarish ko manjuuri di gai thi
 He said "if the minister is responsible for approving a recommendation, the entire system of government will collapse
" " About 95 per cent of trains run in the country
 Late Tejas Express, the first corporate train of compensation up to Rs 250, has started running on the track, which has announced compensation for delay
 shuukravaar ko uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne lakhanu main train ko hari jhandi dikhaakar ravaanaa kiya
 Arrangements have been made to provide compensation of up to Rs 250 to passengers on the delay of Tejas train
 tejas train let hone par muaavje kaa praavdhantejas train agar ek ghanta let hoti he, to 100 rupee or 2 ghante let hoti he, to 250 rupee muaavja diya jayega
 Now the question arises here whether passengers can claim compensation for the delay of other trains, like Tejas train? Difficulty in service is considered a drawback
 iske liye yatri kanjumar forum main cese kar sakate hai or muaavja le sakate hai
 Advocate Kalika Prasad Kala said that in the train ticket issued by the railway, the time of departure of the train and reaching the destination is written
 aise main bina kisi bade kaaran train let nahin honi chahie
 Advocate Kala, who was given compensation before the train was late, also said that the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission has given compensation to an elderly person who fell ill in the year 2011
 neshnal kanjumar disputes redresal kamishan ne train kii deree ko difishiency in sarvice mana he
 Apart from this, the Odisha State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission in the case of Government of India vs Kedarnath Jena also compensated the complainant from the Railways
 bharat sarkaar banaam kedarnath jena ke maamle main shikayatakarta apane bete kaa ilaaj karaane ke liye katak se bengalooru ja rahaa tha
 The train that the complainant was going by Guwahati Express was late for about 10 hours
 iske baad shikayatakarta ne maamle kii shikaayat kanjumar forum main kii thi or muaavje kaa daawa kiya tha
 Advocate Kala says that about 95 per cent of trains in the country run late
 agar yatri train main deree ke liye kanjumar forum main cese karte hai, to yah prakriya lambii chalati he, jiske chalate logon ko muaavja milane main kaaphi samay lag jaataa he
 It will be better if there is a system to compensate passengers for all trains being delayed like Tejas
