 The Buldhana Lok Sabha seat in Vidarbha, Maharashtra has been a Shiv Sena stronghold for the last two decades
 yahaan se 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main shivasena kii tikat par pratap raav jadhav chunaav jitkar saansad bane the
 He defeated NCP candidate Krishna Rao Ingale here
 maaloom ho ki pratap raav jadhav buldhana loksabhaa seat se lagaataar do baar jitkar aa rahe hai
 This time too, Shiv Sena can field them
 vahiin, ensipi lagaataar do baar chunaav main haar jhelane ke baad nae pratyaashee par daanv khel sakati he

 congress va rakanpa apane hisse main se mitra dalon ke liye kuch siten chodenge
 These also include Buldhana Lok Sabha seat
 ensipi is baar yahaan se majboot pratyaashee chunaav main utaar sakati he
 What has been the history of the seat
 
 
 
 The Buldhana Lok Sabha seat has been a Congress stronghold for over 40 years
 yahaan sabase pehle chunaav 1951 main hua tha us vakt yahaan ek seat se do saansad gopalrav bajirao khedkar or lakshmana bhatkar chunaav jitkar sansad pahunche the
 It is known that Gopalrao Bajirao Khedkar was also the first President of Maharashtra Pradesh Congress
 aapako bataa den ki buldhana loksabhaa aisi seat thi jahaan kabhi seat ek hua karti thi or saansad do the
 In fact, in the first two general elections in the country after independence, two mps from Vidarbha's Bhandara, Akola and Buldhana constituencies were elected simultaneously
 isamen ek khule pravarg se va ek arakshit (anusuchit jati) varg se chune jate the
 For this reason, two mps were elected in the general election before Buldhana
 1952 main arakshit varg se lakshmana bhatkar va khule pravarg se congress ke gopalrav khedkar chunaav jite the
 The reserved seat from Buldhana was abolished in the second general election held in 1957
 iske baad 1957 ke loksabhaa chunaav main shivaram rango rane chunaav jitkar aae
 After this, he won the elections in 1962, 1967 and reached the Lok Sabha
 lekin shivaram rango rane ke 1970 main nidhan ke baad yahaan dobaaraa loksabhaa chunaav hue
 This time too Congress came here by winning and YS Shivram won the Lok Sabha
 wo yahaan se 1971 main bhi phir chunaav jite
 When the Congress lost here for the first time in 30 years
 
 
 
 In the 1977 Lok Sabha elections, the Republic Party of India (khobragade) broke the Congress' winning streak and won Daulat Gunjaji Gavai elections for the first time here
 haalanki, iske agle hi loksabhaa chunaav yani ki balachandra ramchandra vaasanic congress ko yahaan jeet dilaane main kaamyaab rahe
 After him, son Mukul Wasnik won elections from here in 1984 on a Congress ticket
 bas ek hi baar jiti bijepi
 
 
 This seat was won by BJP for the first time in 1989
 sukhdev nanaaji kaale yahaan se chunaav jitkar pahunche
 However, in 1991, Mukul Wasnik won again and made a return to the Congress
 is baar bijepi yahaan koi kamaal nahin kar pai
 Rise of Shiv Sena
 
 
 1996 main shivasena ke aanandarav vithoba adsul buldhana loksabhaa seat par pehali baar jitkar aae or is seat par sena kaa khaataa kholaa
 Shiv Sena also spread its foot in the assembly constituencies here
 lekin 1998 ke chunaav main mukul vaasanic ne baaji palatate hue chunaav jeeta
 This was Shiv Sena's first defeat
 shivasena ne is seat par aanandarav vithoba adsul ko dobaaraa utarkar daanv khelaa
 He won in 1999, 2004
 iske baad aanandarav vithoba adsul ne amravati kii seat sanbhali or 2009 main yahaan pratap raav jadhav khadey hue
 He won this seat continuously in 2009 and 2014
 kya he vidhansabha kshetron kii sthiti
 
 
 Buldhana Lok Sabha seat consists of 6 assembly seats
 isamen buldhana or chikhali vidhansabha seat par congress kaa kabza he
 At the same time, Shiv Sena and Sindhmed Raja and Mehkar assembly seats are occupied by Shiv Sena and BJP in Khamgaon and Jalgaon Jamod seats
 bhartiya janata party ke lambey intjaar ke baad aakhirkaar loksabhaa chunaav ke liye ummidavaaron ke naam kii ghoshnaa kar di gai
 On the evening of Holi, BJP Central Election Committee (CEC) Secretary JP Nadda announced the names of 184 candidates in the first list
 baad main daman and div ke liye bhi ek naam kii ghoshnaa kii gai
 In this way, the number of candidates declared by BJP has now increased to 185
 in naamon main bijepi ke varisht netaa or gujarat ke gandhinagar se saansad laal krishna adwani kaa naam nahin he
 BJP President Amit Shah will replace him in the field
 mana ja rahaa he ki bhaajapa is baar 75 saal se zyada umr ke netaaon ko tikat nahin degi
 This is the reason why senior BJP leaders Kalraj Mishra (MP from Deoria, Uttar Pradesh) and Bhagat Singh Kosari (MP from nainital-udham Singh Nagar, Uttarakhand) had announced not to contest
 adwani ke alaava uttarakhand kii hi gadhwal seat se bhuwan chandra khanduri kii jagah tirath singh ravat ko tikat diya gaya he to koshyari ke peeche hatane se pradesh bhaajapa adhyaksh ajay bhatta ko maidan main utaara gaya he
 Khanduri had also announced not to contest elections due to his old age
 is hisaab se dekhen to bhaajapa in chunaavon main senior netaaon kii jagah kam umr or yuva chehron ko variyata di ja rahi he
 Talking about Gujarat, the last time Prime Minister Narendra Modi contested from Vadodara seat besides Varanasi
 haalanki, baad main unhone vadodara seat chhod di thi
 This time the Gujarat unit of the BJP demanded Modi or Shah to fight Gujarat
 is baar amit shah gujarat main 91 saal ke laal krishna adwani kii seat gandhinagar se khadey ho rahe hai
 Talking about Kalraj Mishra, he is 78 years old
 maujuuda samay main vah uttar pradesh kii devaria seat se saansad hai or unke paas sookshm laghu or madhyam udhyam mantralay (rajya mantri- swatantra prabhaar) bhi tha, lekin baad main unase yah prabhaar le liya gaya tha
 There were discussions to make him Governor in between, but this could not happen
 unke chunaav na ladane kii ghoshnaa ke baad yahaan par sakriy bhaajapa ke yuva netaa tikat ke daavedaar maane ja rahe hai
 At the same time, Murali Manohar Joshi is also 85 years old
 vah 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main kanpur se jite the
 After Advani's ticket was cut off and Kalraj and Koshyari left the field, speculations are being made that the BJP may field a young leader in his place from Kanpur
 bhaajapa kii shesh loksabhaa ummidavaaron kii list aani abhi baaki he
 The 85-year-old leader and Advani's absence from Lal Krishna Advani (91 years) and 85-year-old Bhuvan Chand Khanduri, 77-year-old Bhagat Singh Koshiyari and 78-year-old Kalraj Mishra were left out of the first list of 184 candidates
 The ticket of fellow Murali Manohar Joshi can also be cut

 magar jaise hi kendriya sansadeey kaary mantri anant kumaar ne yah sandesh diya ki mathon main bhaajapa netaaon ke pahunchane ke liye rajamandi party adhyaksh amit shah ne hasil kar lee he, tane hue chehron par kuch sukun kaa bhav dikhne laga
 This gives an idea of what the importance of monasteries in Karnataka is, but it also shows how desperately the BJP needs with the monasteries
 haalanki yah rajamandi bhi aasaani se hasil nahin kii ja saki he
 That incident is also interesting
 pichley saal july ke antim saptaah main bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah karnataka daure kaa kaarykram tay kar chuke the
 But before that, he wanted time to meet Swami Nirmalananda of Adi Chunchanagiri, the most prominent monastery of Vokkaligga community
 pataa chalaa ki swami desh se baahar hai
 After all, Shah himself called Nirmalanand by phone and took an appointment on 12 August
 is tarah unhen apana daura do hafte tak taalna padaa
 Shah was not so eager to meet the lord of the Chunchangiri Math
 bhaajapa ke 'chanakya', shah is baat se waakif hai ki karnataka main satta mathon se hokar guzarati he
 Then former Prime Minister H
K
, a prominent leader of the Vokkaligga community
 di
 Deve Gowda is considered and his party Janata Dal (secular) is considered to have a great influence on the Chunchangiri Math
 so, amit shah or bhaajapa kii koshish is baar math kaa aashirwad paane kii he, taaki vokkaligga samudaay main paith banaai ja sake
 Well, on August 12, Amit Shah's meeting with Nirmalananda lasted for more than 5 hours
 haalanki nirmalanand kehete hai, ''itani lambii mulaakaat main siyasat kii koi baat nahin hui
 Yes, talks about the state of the state and the country did happen, but neither the BJP president sought any support, nor did the monastery support or oppose anyone politically
 ''haalanki math ke sutron kaa kahana he ki amit shah nirmalanand ko is baat ke liye raji kar gaye ki unka aashirwad lene bhaajapa ke duusare bade netaa or centre sarkaar ke mantri math aate rahenge
 After this long meeting, there was a discussion in the state that the Swami of Vokkaligga Math is inclined towards BJP
 ve bhaajapa ke samarthan kii baat bhale na karen magar virodh to nahin hi karenge
 After that Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Union Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar also met Nirmalanand
 amit shah ke daure ke baad anant kumaar, sadanand gauda jaise kendriya mantri bhi aadi chunachangiri math kaa daura kar chuke hai
 According to information received from the monastery, there is a long list of Union ministers and senior BJP leaders seeking an appointment with Swami Nirmalanand
 philhal unhen samay nahin diya gaya he, kyonki swamiji kaa aadesh he ki rajnatik kaarykram ke dauraan karnataka aane vaale kisi bhi dal ke netaa se ve milanaa nahin chaahate
 Actually, monasteries in Karnataka are not just centers of spiritual and cultural activities, they are in the role of a very important 'social institution'
 garib bacchon ke laalan-paalan se lekar, shiksha-diksha tak kii vyavastha math kii ore se hoti he
 Their doors are open to people of all religions and castes
 is lihaaj se yahaan ke math kisi sarkari sanstha kii tarah kaam karte hai
 The issues which can be part of the manifesto of any political party, they have been doing all the work for a hundred years
 garibon ko bhojan, bacchon ko shiksha, garib ghar kii ladakiyon kii shaadi, ejineering or medical college tathaa anya shikshan santhaan sab kuch mathon ke tahat chalata he
 Hence, according to experts, the state's large population (up to 85 per cent according to some people) is directly or indirectly associated with some monastery
 rajya ke sabhi 30 jilon main mathon kaa jaal failaa hua he
 The monastery has its own dominance and dominance in terms of caste equation which attracts political parties towards them
 rajya main sabase adhik dabadabe vaale lingayat samudaay kii sankhya 18 fisadi he
 The main monastery of this community is Siddaganga at Tumkur, about 80 km from Bangalore
 is math ko bhaajapa samarthak mana jaataa he
 Its chief Shivkumar Swami has been 110 years old and is ill
 math kaa sara kaam ab siddhalinga swami dekhte hai
 They say, our state has more than 400 monasteries
 math kisi rajnatik dal kaa na to virodh karata he, na hi samarthan
 We work diligently with social concerns and we are supported by all
 '' na math kisi rajnatik dal kaa samarthan nahin karata he to phir siddhaganga math ko bhaajapa kaa samarthak kyon kaha jaataa he?siddhalinga swami kaa jawaab he, ''shaayad bhaajapa ke mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar bi
 s
 yediurppa ke lingayat samudaay se hone kii vajah se aisa he
 But our monastery also attracts leaders from other parties and other communities
 ham rajnatik rup se nirpeksh hai
 Vokkaligga is the second dominant caste of Karnataka in terms of population
 isaki aabaadi 12 fisadi he
 The major monastery of this community is Adi Chunchangiri
 ise janata dal (secular) samarthak math mana jaataa he
 HD Deve Gowda is considered the greatest leader of the Vokkaligga community
 math kaa prabhaav dakshin karnataka main apekshaakrit adhik he
 It is the same area in the state where the highest number of JDS mlas wins since 1985
 rajya main vokkaligga samudaay ke 150 math hai, jinamein zyaadaatar dakshin karnataka main hai
 The monastery has dozens of educational institutions
 haalanki math main kisi bhi jati yaa dharm ke bacchon ke liye koi pratibandh nahin he lekin sabase adhik bachche vokkaligga samudaay se hi hai
 Swami Nirmalananda of the monastery denies that the monastery is a JDS supporter but the people of the monastery indirectly accept that, "the Vokkaligga community can move forward in every sphere of society, irrespective of politics, it The monastery wants it
 ''math ke pramukh swami nirmalanand kehete hai, ''math ko kisi rajnatik party kaa samarthak bataanaa thik nahin he
 If this happens then why would the leaders of BJP, Congress and other parties come
 hamase jo bhi shraddha se milanaa chahta he, sabhi ke liye hamaare daravaaje khule hai
 The third major monastery is associated with the Qurba community
 80 se adhik math is samudaay se jude hai
 The main monastery is the Srigaire monastery in Davanagere
 maujuuda mukhyamantri siddharamaiya isi samudaay se aate hai
 The Kurba population in the state is 8 percent
 iske alaava suttur math-mysuru, aasthaa math-udupi, murusvira math-hubli, kamapari math-chikmaglur vagairah pramukh hai
 People from SC-ST community are connected to these monasteries
 har rajnatik dal ke netaa in mathon kaa samarthan paane kii jugat main hai
 The entire BJP is trying to practice the Adi Chunchangiri Math (vokkaligga) this time because Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has made inroads in the Tumkur Math, considered to be pro-bjp
 mukhyamantri ne lingayat ko alag dharm kaa darja dene kii pahal shuru kar di he
 Due to this, the inclination of Lingayat community or at least the monastery seems to be towards Siddaramaiah
 siddhalinga swami kehete hai, ''mujhe pataa he ki mukhyamantri ne lingayat ko alag dharm kaa darja dene kii baat kii he
 If this happens, certainly the constitutional and legal benefits that people of minority religion get will also be given to the Lingayat community
 math samudaay ke kalyaan ke liye hi kaam kar rahaa he, koi isamen madad karata he to uskaa dhanyavad
 "in fact, Siddaramaiah has tried to shock the BJP with this sigope
 bhaajapa is mudde par kuch bhi kehane kii sthiti main nahin he sivaa iske ki aisa karnaa sambhav nahin he
 bjp's Chief Ministerial candidate Yeddyurappa says, "congress has only made political statements
 mahaj lingayat hi nahin anya samudaay ke logon kaa bhi bhaajapa ko samarthan he
 People are not going to get caught in the Congress conspiracy
 ''duusari ore, mukhyamantri siddharamaiya kehete hai, ''rajya main jitne bhi math hai un sab kaa samarthan congress ko he
 Why is Yeddyurappa sitting silently on the issue of granting separate religion status to Lingayats? "the lord of the monastery may claim that he is politically neutral but the reality is that Karnataka has neither politics without the monastery, nor politics Math without rajya ke muddon se lekar, pratyaashiyon ke chayan tak main math pratyaksh or paroksh rup se shaamil hai
 After getting power, there is a penetration of monasteries in the cabinet
 math ke logon se mili jaankaree ke mutabik, har dal ke netaa math ke swami ko party ke har faisle kii tatkaal jaankaree dete hai
 For example, how many tickets were given to the people of which community in the ticket distribution, how many people were advocated by the Math, how many were given tickets, etc
 iske baad hi math yah faisla karata he ki kis dal ko vot dene kaa paroksh yaa pratyaksh rup se sandesh anuyaayiyon ko diya jaae
 The signs of supporting any party or candidate on behalf of the monasteries are also fun
 bhaajapa ko samarthan dene ke liye bhakton ko pravachan yaa darshan dete vakt swami apane haath kii ungaliyon ko pushp aakaar main rakhte hai
 Or they are seated with a flower in their hand or throw flowers on the devotees before going after the darshan
 congress ko samarthan dena he to swami haath upar uthaakar rakhte hai
 If the JDS is asked to vote, Swami puts his Angavastram (towel-towel) on his left shoulder
 jedies netaa devegoda apane baayen kandhe par angavastram rakhte hai
 However, due to the importance of monasteries, leaders of every party are eager to get blessings nowadays
 ''main yaa meraa math raajnneeti se dur he''math kya is baar bhaajapa ko samarthan degaa? On the bjp's victory in Gujarat, Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav said that we accept the decision given by the public
 yah thik baat he ki janata ne bijepi ko mandet diya he
 It is far behind the claim that BJP was making
 vahiin congress party ne bahut acha pradarshan kiya he
 Akhilesh Yadav said that the questions raised by the farmers, the poor, the voters of the village have supported the equation and the equation that has been made is also visible

 The bjp's last-time election campaign damaged the Congress and its allies

 The youth of Gujarat lost there

 May 2019 Grand Alliance in 2019, we would like an alliance to be formed
 lekin gathbandhan kin muddon par ho, yah sabase zyada jaruri he
 On which issues we will go among the public, then perhaps we will be able to avoid the attention that is trying to divert us at the last moment
 2019 main mudde bhi ho or gathbandhan bhi ho to shaayad ek bada mahagathbandhan ban saktaa he
 Akhilesh Yadav said that before the alliance, i think there is a need for issues among the public
 jahaan tak samaajawaadee party kaa sawaal he, ham apane sanghathan ko majboot karne ke baad hi koi faisla lenge
 Congress gave a fight Akhilesh Yadav said that Congress is the largest national party
 aise main congress kii bhoomika mahatvapurn hogi
 He has done well and given a fight to the BJP
 rahul gandhi ne bahut mehnat kii he or mehnat ke number nahin die ja sakate
 But in 2019, we will give a tough challenge to the BJP

 unka maananaa he ki logon ne unhen isliye vot nahin die kyonki unhone zyada drama nahin kiya
 55-year-old Ramesh Shankar of Kankarbagh, Patna, is worried these days about his children's playing and their technical games
 unka maananaa he ki bacchon ko aaj bhale hi in khelon main majaa aa rahaa ho, lekin paramparaagat khel hi unhen acha insaan banane main madad kar sakate hai
 Ramesh is not the only person in Bihar who is worried about these technical games
 raja bazaar ke kanwaljeet singh bhi kehete hai ki aajkal shaharon ke bachche piespi vita, play stesan move, pies-3 jaise khelon par rojaanaa ghanton samay bitaa rahe hai
 His craze is crippling him not only physically but also practically
 vah kehete hai ki pehle shaharon main bhi bachche luka-chhipi, ati-pati, gilli-danda, kit-kit, rassi kud jaise parmparik khelon se man bahalaate the, lekin ab bachche in khelon se dur ho gaye hai
 Many parents are also shying away their children from traditional sports, as this game makes them feel backward
 bujurgo kaa kahana he, ‘hamaare bachapan main khele jane vaale vah khel na keval sharir ko swasth rakhane main madad karte the, balki team main kaam karne ke liye prerit karte the
 Not only this, this game also helped in mental development
 ’gardanibagh nivasee 70 varshiya ramakali devi kahati hai, ‘ladakon kii baat to chhod dijie, ladkiyaan bhi tej dhoop va barish main khub khelti thim
 Children used to fall, get hurt and then used to get up and play themselves
 shaayad isliye is umr main bhi ham shaareerik rup se majboot hai
 Recalling his childhood and youth, Ramkali says, 'we did not fall ill at that time
 lekin ab bachche apane abhibhavakon ke saath kamare main simat gaye hai
 Can not tolerate sun, rain
 agar dhoop main kuch der rahanaa pad jaae to vah biimaar ho jate hai
 Now the children of the city do not even know the name of traditional games
 ’patna kii jaani-maani samajashastri professor renu ranjan bhi kahati hai ki yah aadhuniktaa kii andhi daud kaa nateeja he
 She says that children today are not able to understand each other's feelings
 aaj ke daur main bhale hi bacchon kaa maansik rup se vikaas ho rahaa ho parantu shaareerik rup se unka vikaas thik dhang se nahin ho rahaa he
 She used to say, “earlier children used to meet each other on the pretext of sports, their coordination was done by the natural environment, but now it is getting away from the children
 motopa kii samasya bhi bad gai he
 'another sociologist believes that the main reason for missing the traditional game is the blind race of modernity
 aajkal mata-pita hi bacchon ko paramparaagat khel se dur kar rahe hai
 They do not want to let them away from home
 unhen lagata he ki bacchon ko chot lag jaaegi, vah bighad jaaenge
 Because of this thinking, they keep them locked in the room
 vaise, in khelon ke gum hone kii ek mukhya vajah he shahar main apartments kaa bananaa
 With the grounds disappearing from the city, children are limited to video games in apartments
 is tarah ab na vah khel rah gaye hai or na hi unase milane vaali sikh
 When Israel's Air Force One lands in New Delhi on January 14, there will be many reasons to consider the gestures of both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 modi ke israel daure ke, jo kisi bhartiya pradhanmantri kaa pehla daura tha, sirf chah maheene baad hi yah kisi israeli pradhanmantri kaa pehla bharat daura hoga
 Modi was strongly welcomed in Tel Aviv, embracing each other with great warmth, showing a sense of personal friendship between the two
 iske baad hayfa main olga samudr tat par bachapan ke doston kii tarah tahaltey hue donon pradhanmantriyon kii tasviren khinchi gayi
 To avoid getting wet in the water, the mods of both pants were bent upwards
 is baar netanyahu kaa daura, jo utana hi aitihaasik hoga, nai dilli or tel aviv ke bich rishton main kathith sheetaltaa ke bich ho rahaa he
 On 22 December, India voted with 127 other nations on the UN General Assembly resolution against US President Donald Trump's declaration of Jerusalem as Israel's capital
 netanyahu ne bharat kaa naam liye bina is vot ko 'haasyaaspad' or 'betuka naatak' bataaya tha
 a week after that, Israel's state-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd said on 2 January that India's Defense Ministry had canceled a $ 500 million deal to supply 1,600 light-weight anti-tank spike missiles, most recently The biggest deal was in years
 ye misile takanic transfar ke jariye ek nijee company bharat forj or sarkaar ke swaamitv vaali bharat dianemics limited ke aapasi sahyog se bharat main hi banaai jaani thim
 a Rafale spokesperson expressed 'grief' over the cancellation of the deal, which the company had tried for nearly five years
 3 janvari ko bharat ke raksha mantralay kii ore se turat-phurat rafel ko 131 baraak mixilon kaa 460 karod ru
 The consolation announcement of the order of KJ also could not make up for the misery created in Tel Aviv by the cancellation of that deal (the deal was cleared in early 2017)
 spike saude ko twarit prastaav ke taur par phir se shuru kiya gaya he, or rafel ek baar phir iskaa pratiyogi hoga
 Another big deal under consideration for five years — Rs 15,000 crore
 kaa 155 / 52 mem ke hovitger topon kii aapurti—khatre main bataaya ja rahaa he
 In this, Israel's cannon manufacturer Elbit is competing against France's Nexter
 lekin sanyukt raashtra kaa vot israel ke liye sachmuch ek bada jhatka tha
 Most felt that India would not participate in voting
 3 janvari ko sansad main bharat ke videsh mantralay ke bayaan main kaha gaya ki ''falstin par bharat kaa rukh swatantra or sthaayee he
 It is in line with our attitudes and interests and is not governed by the influence of any other country
 '' israel ke bade akhbaar haretj main 4 janvari ko ek lekh kaa sheershak tha, ''bharat israel ke saath sambandh to chahta he lekin gambhir nahin
 "obviously, the new Indian foreign policy was missing in it
" saudi arab main bharat ke purv rajdoot talamis ahamed sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main bharat ke vot ko saidhantik bataate hai
 He says, "according to international law, an area which has been grabbed by military power cannot be declared its own and the final status must be decided with the consent of both sides
" bharat kii sthiti bhi israel or falstin jaisi he kyonki kashmir kaa ek bada hissaa 1948 se pakistan ke kabje main he or ham is par kisi desh kaa aadhipaty sweekaar nahin karenge
 "it does not seem that India will move away from its two-nation policy" that Israel and the future Palestinians live peacefully together ", as Modi had with Israel Hayom before Israel's visit in July
 Said in conversation
 netanyahu ke bharat daure ke turant baad pradhanmantri modi israel kaa daura kiye bina falstin kii prashasnic rajdhani ramalla kaa daura karne vaale hai
 Modi's visit will be in response to Palestinian President Mohammad Abbas's visit to New Delhi in May 2017, two months before Modi's Tel Aviv visit
 mahatvapurn baat he ki bhartiya pradhanmantri ne israel daure ke samay jerusalem (jis par israel or falstin, donon apni rajdhani hone kaa daawa karte hai) kii yatra nahin kii thi
 Palestine is thus kept out of the relationship between India and Israel as India strengthens its relations with the six countries of Israel and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) — Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and Kuwait
 Wants to do and have a free trade relationship with them
 bharat ne israel ke saath 1992 main purna rajanyik sambandh sthapit kiye the, kyonki use jisisi deshon ke saath sambandh kharaab hone kaa dar tha
 These were the largest countries to supply energy to India, apart from this about 70 percent of the expatriates live here and send about 35 billion dollars of foreign exchange to India annually
 jisisi ke saath bharat ke nae sambandhon par pashchim asia kii uthal-puthal or teji se badalati bhu-raajnneeti kaa prabhaav pad saktaa he
 a secret alliance is being formed between Saudi Arabia, Israel and the US to prevent the influence of Iran and the Shia bloc spreading from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arabian Sea
 bharat ke sambandh in sabhi deshon ke saath achche hai, khaskar iran ke saath, jisaki use pakistan ke sahyog bina afghanistan or madhya asia main pahunchane ke liye jarurat he
 He also finds a small north-south transport corridor via Bandar Abbas that shortens the road to transport to Russia
 netanyahu kaa daura bahut vyast hoga or pratikatmakataa se bharaa hoga—patni sara ke saath taj mahal main tasviren khinchi jaaengi, gujarat main sabarmati waterfrant jaaenge or phir mumbai main 11 varshiya moshe holtjberg ke saath chhabd house dekhne jaaenge
 Moshe's parents were killed in the 26 / 11 terrorist attack
 yah is baat kaa sanket hoga ki donon hi desh aatankwaad ko lekar chintit hai
 Both India and Israel are in the process of building economic ties ahead of diamond and defense deals
 2016-17 main donon deshon ke bich dwipaksheeya vyapaar 5
 02 billion dollars in which there was no defense deal (estimated at $ 600 million annually)
 kaccha, gaiyr-audyogic hiron kaa aayaat-niryaat ek arab dollar se zyada rahaa tha
 Netanyahu's 100-member delegation will have representatives from companies in security, agriculture, water management, defense and technology
 pichley saal june main unki cabinet bharat main gaiyr-hira niryaat ko 25 pratishat tak badhaane or aranddy ke liye 4 karod dollar kharch karne par raji ho gai thi
 The proposals included giving Bollywood facilities for shooting in Israel and promoting numerous Indian companies for business
 lekin yah kahana jitna aasaan he, karnaa utana hi kathin hoga
 The technology of separating salt from agriculture, water and seawater, in which Israel wants to become a major player, will prove to be a big challenge for many reasons such as the cost and small agricultural lands of farmers
 bharat ke kisaanon ke liye samudri pani se namak alag karne or laghu sinchai kii praudyogiki mahangi ho sakati he lekin pani or bijli sasti he kyonki unhen baari sabsadi di jaati he
 That is why the indo-israeli defense relationship is the most beneficial area of growth, in which the government is the customer
 israel bharat kaa teesraa sabase bada raksha hardware aapurtikarta he jo 2012 or 2016 ke bich desh ke hathiyaar aayaat kaa 7
 Was 2 percent
 isamen radar, misile, yuddh ke electronic upkaran system or bam shaamil the
 India accounts for more than 40 percent of Israel's defense exports, earning it around $ 1 billion of foreign exchange annually
 israeli companiyon ne 2017 main smart bam, radio, lager dejigneshan pod or mixilon ke ek arab dollar ke saude hasil kiye jabaki south block 'mek in india' ko badhaava dene ke liye hathiyaaron ke aayaat main katautee karne kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 Israel has been successful in creating monopolies in several key areas
 israel airospes industries (ieaai) kaa bharat main nigaraanee rakhane vaale dronon ke bazaar par puraa dabadabaa he, kyonki sena ke teenon ang kareeb 176 herron or searchar-2 dronon kaa istemaal karte hai
 This number itself is more than the total number of drones used in Israel
 ieaai or rafel nausena or vaayu sena ke liye madhyam duuri—70 kimi kii duuri se vimaan ko nishaanaa bana sakate hai—kii mixilon ke bazaar par dabadabaa rakhti hai
 In April last year, India became the third country to use MRSAM when the Ministry of Defense signed a $ 2 billion deal for a regiment of MRSAM missiles — 16 launchers and 560 missiles
 yah israel ke itihaas kaa sabase bada sauda tha
 IAI and Rafael 1 to meet the Indian Navy's surface-to-air (SRSAM) short-range 10 missile systems and 600 missiles
 5 arab dollar kii ek anya pariyojna kii pramukh pratiyogi hai
 There could also be another big deal — a $ 3 billion deal for two Falcon Airborne Early Warning and Controls (AEW & Cs) fitted on IL-76 aircraft
 yah vimaan 800 kimi kii duuri se dushman ke vimaan, missile or drone kaa pataa laga saktaa he
 There is immense potential to strengthen the india-israel relationship

 ITBP has created a Matrimonial Portal by 450 women and men to register
 The indo-tibetan Border Police (ITBP) deployed along the india-china border has taken a unique initiative

 So far, 450 ITBP women and men have registered on itbp's Matrimonial Portal
 itibipi se mili jaankaree ke mutabik 3 din pehle tak 150 hi registration hue the jinaki sankhya ab record 3 guna bad gai he
 This type of portal has been built for the first time in any paramilitary force
 is bal main philhal vibhinn rankon main kareeb 25,000 avivaahit purush or 1000 mahilaayein hai
 ITBP personnel are usually posted in remote areas
 aise main unke parivaar kii ore se ek acha jeevanasathi dhundhna chunauteepurn kaary he
 Then, if a spouse is found in the ITBP itself, nothing can be better than this
 abhi bal main kareeb 333 karyrat danpati hai (yani pati-patni donon hi itibipi main) or bahut saare karmi is sanghathan main kaam karne vaala hi jeevanasathi chaahate hai, kyonki sarkari niyam us danpati ko ek hi sthaan par tainaati kii suvidha dete hai
 The ITBP, about 2
5 lakh unmarried personnel in all central forces, has taken this important step to work in keeping with the harsh duty that they provide on the mountainous border

 This is the first matrimonial portal of the paramilitary forces of the country wherein 25000 men and more than 1000 women who are still bachelor in ITBP will be available to register
 9 disambar ko portal laanch huasaath hi unhone bataaya ki abhi itibipi main 333 yugal danpati hai or bahut saare purush va mahila aapas main vivaah karne ke icchhuk hote hai
 But due to not getting the right platform, they do not have marriages among themselves
 isko dhyaan main rakhte hue itibipi ke mahanideshak ne 9 disambar ko is portal ko laanch kiya jiske jariye ab itibipi ke javaanon ko phayda hoga
 Vivek Pandey also informed that this portal is completely safe for ITBP jawans and no information can be entered in it in a wrong way
 naa hi is portal main bahari tatwon kaa koi dakhal ho saktaa he jiskaa phayda surakshit tareeke se itibipi ke himavir uthaa sakenge

 The batsmen have to bear the brunt of such mistakes of the umpire and the wicket achieved in such a situation leads to 'batting' of the rival team and the bowler

 No one knows whether Dhoni had read the English poem 'invictus' or whether he heard in the voice of Hollywood actor Morgan Freeman that i am the master of my destiny, i am the captain of my soul
 kavita kaa bhav bhinn ho saktaa he lekin uski bhaavana kahin na kahin judi hui he, dhoni ne buudhvaar raat jab apana faisla saarvajanik kiya to unke man main kahin na kahin aise bhav bane honge
 Gavaskar had also taken such a step after Sunil Gavaskar, no Indian cricketer showed the same poise and foresight as the Jharkhand cricketer on Wednesday announced to relinquish the limited overs captaincy through the BCCI
 jab gavaskar ne captaini se hatane kaa faisla kiya to unhone 1985 main benson and hejes vishwa championships jiti thi, iske baad jab unhone sanyas liya to chinnaswami stadium main 1987 main 96 ran kii jaandaar pari kheli thi
 These were the times when people were expecting him to play more
 record kaa laalach nahinkhiladiyon ko ham amuman yah kehete hue sunate hai ki ham record ke liye nahin khelte lekin kitne is par amal karte hai
 In the case of Dhoni, however, it proves that he does not play for the record, when Dhoni retired from Test cricket, he was only ten Tests away from playing 100 Test matches for the country but he heard the sound of his heart and that Believed it
 vahiin vanade main bhi vah 199 maichon kii captaini kar chuke the chaahate to 200 kaa aankada chhu sakate the lekin aisa nahin kiya kyonki vah jaanate the ki viraat kohli pad sanbhaalane ke liye taiyaar hai or faisla lenaa kaa yahi sahi samay he
 Significantly, the most successful captain of the Indian cricket team, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, has decided to give up the captaincy of odis and T20s
 haalanki dhoni vanade or tii-20 match khelte rahenge
 Dhoni will also be available for selection in odis and T20 matches against England
 aapako bataa den ki dhoni test cricket se pehle hi sanyas le chuke hai
 Read also - Dhoni left the ODI, captain of T-20, said- a captain in all three formats will not necessarily forget these 8 stages of Captain Dhoni's career indian footbal iken sunil chhetri kaa kahana he ki indian super lig ke aane se desh main footbal kii lokapriyata badhi he or ab stareey maichon ke aayojan or acchhee media kawarej se isamen ijapha karnaa he
 Increased popularity Chhetri said, 'the popularity of the sport has increased in the country since the arrival of ISL
 logon kii ruchi main ijapha hua he
 The audience is coming in large numbers on the field and the interest of corporate groups and media has also increased
 hamen ise barkaraar rakhana hoga yah pehla kadam he or abhi bahut kuch karnaa he
 Need to improve the level The only footballer Chhetri, who scored 50 goals for India, said that there is a need to improve practice facilities and the level of the game
 unhone kaha, 'hamen yah sunishchit karnaa hoga ki abhyaas kii uchit suvidhaayen mili taaki khel kaa str behatar ho
 If the level of the game is better then the audience will increase
 bhartiya footbal badlaav ke daur se guzar rahaa he
 We have young players and a new coach
 nattejey dene main samay lagegaa lekin sirf rashtriya team ke behatar pradarshan se fark nahin padegaa

 Punjab National Bank (PNB) Mahaghotale accused Nirav Modi has refused to appear on the summons of the Enforcement Directorate (ED)
 idi ne bank frod maamle main poochtacha ke liye neerav modi ko saman jari kiya tha, lekin usne aane se inkaar kar diya
 The ED has confirmed this to Mail Today
 idi ne guuruuvaar ko bataaya ki neerav modi ko do baar saman bheja gaya tha, ummid thi ki vah nideshaalay ke afasaron ke samaksh 22 farvari ko pesh hoga, lekin vah nahin aayaa
 Nirav Modi refused to appear before the ED by email
 usne email main likhaa he ki vah videsh main he or abhi kaaphi vyast he, lihaaja vah idi ke saman par pesh nahin ho paaegaa
 The funny thing is that he has not even asked for a date to appear before the ED
 hira kaarobaari neerav modi parophnbhko 11000 karod se zyada kii chapat lagane kaa aarope he
 It is being said that on the basis of the letter of undertaking, he took these money from banks as a loan and fled the country in the event of non-return

 Therefore, he is no longer able to repay the money
 neerav modi ne pienbi ko likhaa ki bank or mere afasaron ke bich hui baatcheet or 13 farvari-15 farvari ko likhe hue aapke mail ke aadhaar par main aapse kuch baat karnaa chahta hum
 Constant actions are being taken against us from the bank
 lekin bainkon kii taraf se or media main jo 11000 karod kii raashi bataai ja rahi he, vah kaaphi zyada he
 The Nirav Modi Group has taken a loan of less money
 mere khilaaf shikaayat darj hone ke baad bhi maine aapse likhakar kaha tha ki mujhe firestar group ke kuch share bechney kii ijaajat di jaae, iske alaava bhi isse judin 3 companiyon ke share beche jaaen
 All these are worth about 6500 crores rupees, which would help repay the bank's amount
 neerav modi ne likhaa ki pienbi ke dwaara kii gai shikaayat ke baad kii gai karrwai or media kawarej se fire international privet limited (FIPL) company ko kaaphi nuksaan pahunchaa he
 Which can make it very difficult for us to pay the dues of banks
 neerav ne likhaa ki bank kii taraf se pichley kai varshon main teen companiyon par byrs credit ko badhaayaa gaya he
 During this time, there is no disturbance in any company
 jo bhi paisa pienbi se lone ke taur par liya gaya tha, uskaa istemaal videshi shakhaon main advance pement karne ke liye kiya gaya he
 FIPL and FPIPL have been in profit for the past several years and have also got an A-ranking
 neerav ne likhaa ki jaisaa ki bank jaanata he ki PNB ne khud pichley kai saal se hamen die gaye paison par byaaj lene kaa laabh uthaaya he, or unhen byaaj samet pienbi kii sari raashi chukaai bhi gai he
 Wrote ahead of them, the property which is being continuously raided and according to the media reports, about Rs 5649 crore worth of property is being seized
 agar ye karrwai naa hui hoti to in sampatti or anya kuch sampattiyon ko milakar bank kaa sara paisa lautaaya ja saktaa tha

 In this case, there is also the matter of this Honorable Assembly seat

 '' Comments ejineering kii padhai karne ke baavjood haritha ne mukhya pariksha main vaikalpik vishay ke taur par arthshaastra or malayalam sahitya chunaa tha
 Harita said, "everybody's life revolves around economics

 Malayalam is my mother tongue and i have loved Malayalam since childhood
 ’’ It is after almost two decades that someone from Kerala has secured first position in the UPSC Civil Services Examination
 unhone kaha, ‘‘main pehali baar safal nahin ho paayi thi

 ye baat kisi se chhipi nahin he ki bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) prachaar-prasar main anya mukhyamantriyon yaa centre sarkaar kii tulana main kaafii peeche hai
 Especially unlike the neighboring state's Chief Minister Raghubar Das (raghubar das), he does not stand anywhere
 lekin nitish kumaar ne apane bachaav main kaha he ki wo kaam karne main or logon kii seva karne main vishwaas karte hai or jo kaam nahin karte wo keval prachaar-prasar se surkiyon main bane rahete hai
 Nitish Kumar claimed that Bihar government spends the least money on advertisements
 nitish kumaar buudhvaar ko dilli main apane party ke kaaryakarta prashikshan shivi main bol rahe the
 He said that some people give good advertisements but you see my ad will get very less
 jahaan zarurat hoti he utana hi sarkaar kii uplabdhi ke liye bihar sarkaar vigyaapan detii he
 But some people are dominated only through advertising
 meraa maananaa he ki aap sarkari khazaane ke trustee hai maalik nahin
 Don't spend government money on his propaganda in a rude manner, saying that Nitish said that Gandhiji had also talked to serve the people
 nitish kumaar ne kaha- bihar main endie ekajute, 'chhapaas premi bayanviron' ke chakkar main na padendrasal nitish media main vigyaapan khaaskar jharkhand ke mukhyamantri raghubar das jis prakaar se sarkari vigyapanon ke madhyam se kshetreey channelon par khabar se lekar vigyapanon tak main chhaae rahete hai, usase chidhe hue hai
 Nitish has even made it clear to BJP colleagues in his cabinet that he is against showing news by paying money and would like to spend the same money on people and not on his publicity
 BJP ke mantriyon kaa kahana tha ki jaise jharkhand sarkaar kshetreey channelon par vigyaapan detii he vaise hi bihar sarkaar ko bhi channelon se deal karnaa chahie
 The special feature of Delhi's meeting was that Nitish Kumar made two things clear, one his party will contest the assembly elections and second he supported the demand of full Chief Minister status of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 haalanki unhone arvind kejariwal kaa naam nahin liya lekin mana ja rahaa he ki purna rajya kaa darja janata dal united (jediu) ke menifesto main pehle se rahaa he or nitish kumaar abhi bhi apni maangon par adig hai
 His detractors say that it is the same Nitish Kumar who took silence by showing a symbolic protest when Jammu and Kashmir's full statehood was abolished to stay in power

 President (former) Francois Hollande should also enlighten us how the price went up from 590 crores in 2012 to 1690 crores in 2015 per Rafale fighter jet? Escalation of a mere 1100 crores

 co / j9ajbc6eayverified Timothy or a panic effort to head off @fhollande from telling the full story of why and how a 590 crore Rafale aircraft was bought for 1690 crores

 inakam tex ritern file karne main koi kotahi nahin bartie
 This can be overwhelming
 supreme court ne haal hi main is aashay kaa faisla diya he
 This news has been given by the English newspaper The Times of India
 uske mutabik agar aapane sarkaar dwaara tayshuda samay par yaa phir inakam tex department dwaara notice jari kiye jane ke baad bhi inakam tex kaa ritern nahin file kiya he to aap par mukadmaa chal saktaa he
 In the case of a company or firm, people who do everyday business such as directors or partners can also be prosecuted
 supreme court ne apane ek faisle main ise sahi tehraaya he
 The Supreme Court said that if the trial starts, the tax payer will have to prove what were the circumstances in which he did not file his income tax return
 iskaa sidhaa matlab yah he ki ritern nahin file karne par uskaa sahi kaaran siddh karne kii jimmedaari tex dene vaale kii he
 He has to prove that he did not do it intentionally

 According to the Section 276CC of the Income Tax Act, such cases can be prosecuted

 In Karnataka, the number of farmers who committed suicide this year has crossed 400 due to heavy losses in agriculture
 in kisaanon ne fasal ke nuksaan hone, sookhe aurkarj jaisi vajahon se khudakushiki
 Out of 176 talukas in the state, 135 have been declared drought affected
 is saal monsoon kii barish behad kam hone kii vajah se kisaanon ko baari nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 According to state officials, most of the suicidal farmers chose this route because of debt, which they were helpless to repay
 police ne rajyabar main karj baantne vaale aise 1000 mahajanon ke khilaaf cese darj kiya he, jo garib kisaanon kaa karj dekar, phir ugaahi ke liye sataate the
 In Pudukottai, Tamil Nadu, a van filled with devotees from Sabarimala collided with a truck, killing 11 people
 isamen se 4 logon ne aspataal main dam todaa
 These devotees were returning from the Sabarimala temple in Kerala
 abhi tak mili jaankaree ke mutabik sabarimala ke ye shraddhalu andhra pradesh ke rahane vaale the or sabarimala se waapas laut rahe the
 This incident has come to the fore when there are protests in the Sabarimala temple for the entry of women between the ages of 10 and 50 years
 aapako bataa den ki supreme court ke aadesh ke baad 2 janvari ko tadake 3 bajkar 38 minute par kaale rang ke paridhaan pahane or chehron ko dhakkar kanakadurga (44 varsh) or bindu (42 varsh) naam kii do mahilaon ne police kii nigaraanee vaale sabarimala mandir main pravesh kiya tha
 With this, the centuries-old tradition of prohibition on the entry of women into the temple was broken
 is ghatana ke baad se bhartiya janata party or hinduvadi sanghathan lagaataar virodh pradarshan kar rahe hai
 During this period violent incidents have also been seen in many places in the state
 pradarshnakariyon ne kai bason ko aag ke hawaale kar diya or kai sthanon par todphod kii
 Many protesters and policemen have also been injured in this incident
 hinsak pradarshan ke dauraan police ko halaat ko kaabo karne ke liye aansu gas ke gole tak daagne pade
 After these violent incidents, more than 3,170 people have been detained in Kerala, while more than 1286 cases have been registered
 is ghatana ko lekar bhaajapa netaa or kendriya mantri anant kumaar hegade to yahaan tak kah chuke hai kikerala sarkarsube main kanoon vyavastha banaae rakhane main puri tarah se vifal ho gai he
 The incident of women entering Sabarimala is a day-long rape of Hindus
 vahiin, ravivaar kokendriya kapadaa mantri smriti iranine kanoon vyavastha ko lekar kerala sarkaar par karaara hamalaa bolaa
 He said that law and order in the state has completely collapsed
 soobe main na aam naagarik surakshit he or na hi desh kaa saansad
 The Union Minister said that the house of Rajya Sabha MP v Muralitharan in Kerala was bombed and the state government was witnessing the spectacle
 ravivaar ko press conference ke dauraan irani ne media ko bhi aade haathon liya or kaha ki neshnal media duniya bhar kii khabar dikhaa rahi he, lekin ek rajyasabha ke ghar par hamale kii khabar nahin dikhaa rahi he
 He said that the Bharatiya Janata Party and they strongly criticize the attack on the house of the Rajya Sabha MP and all such violent incidents
 rajyasabha main uthaa sabarimala mudde par jari hinsa kaa maamlavahin, shuukravaar ko rajyasabha main sabarimala mudde par jari hinsa kaa mudda uthaa
 The CPM members walked out of the Upper House raising the issue
 vam sadasyon kaa aarope tha ki sabarimala maamle main supreme court ke faisle ko lagu karaane kii kerala sarkaar kii koshish ko naakaam karne ke liye kerala main bhaajapa or aresas dwaara pryojit hinsa failaai ja rahi he
 Sangay also said that due to India's support for 60 years, the issue of Tibet still remains
 or dalai lamas ke bharat aane ke 60 saal baad isi samarthan ke liye wo bharat ko dhanyavad karnaa chaahate hai
 The Baghpat seat has witnessed this change very closely
 1967 main yahaan se jansangh ne jeet hasil kii thi
 Raghuveer Singh Shastri became an MP, but that was the era of socialists
 1971 main indira lahar aisi chali ki phir se seat congress ko chali gai
 But after this Baghpat seat became the family seat of Chaudhary Charan Singh
 teen baar yahaan se choudhary charan singh jite
 While in the Janata Party and also with the Lok Dal
 iske baad chah baar yahaan se unke bete ajit singh jitate rahe
 The names of Ajit Singh's parties were changed, his status remained
 do baar wo janata dal se lade, ek baar bhartiya kaamgaar kisaan party se or teen baar rashtriya janata dal se
 Of course, he was once defeated by bjp's Sompal Shastri in 1980 and in 2014 by Satyapal Singh
 ab satyapal singh is baar bhi maidan main hai
 This time his son Jayant Chaudhary, not Ajit Singh, is in this seat
 khaas baat ye he ki wo akele nahin hai
 They have an alliance with SP and BSP
 500 bacchon kii maut ke baad maut ke aspataal ke naam se badnaam ho chuke srinagar ke sarkari aspataal ko lekar jitne khulaase ho rahe hai wo hairaan karne vaale hai

 a few days are left for the Amarnath Yatra to begin
 sijafire ke dauraan aatankiyon ke bade hausalon ko dekhte hue sarkaar ne amarnath yatriyon kii suraksha ke liye ek bada faisla liya he
 The largest combatants of India, the Black Cat commandos, will now take over the safety of Amarnath pilgrims
 shraddhaluon kaa ye mahakvach aatankiyon kaa mahakaal sabit hoga
 In order to protect the Amarnath Yatra, the Home Ministry has decided to deploy two dozen NSG commandos
 yah pehali baar he jab amarnath yatra kii paharedaari kii jimmedaari enesji ko mili he
 The Amarnath Yatra is commencing from 28 June
 khufia reporton ke mutabik amarnath yatra ke dauraan yatriyon or suraksha balon ke campo par videshi aatanki bade paimaane kii par hamale kii sajeesh rach rahe hai
 The Wall is equipped with penetration radars and Glock pistols, according to commandosreport, which can hold security forces and civilians hostage during a terrorist attack
 NSG kii crek team dur se maar karne vaale sniper ke alaava waal penitration radar or glok pistal se las he
 The NSG was formed on 16 October 1984 to deal with terrorist activities taking place in the country
 sheersh suraksha adhikariyon ne guuruuvaar ko kashmir main aagaamee vaarshik amarnath yatra ke intjaamon kii samiksha kii
 An army spokesman gave this information today
 pravaktaa ne bataaya ki chinar kor ke commander leftinent general eke bhatta or jammu kashmir ke police mahanideshak es pi vaidya ne victor force commander, kashmir jone ke police mahanireekshak or siarpief ke mahanireekshak ke saath milakar aagaamee amarnath yatra ke suraksha evam prashasnic intjaamon kii sanyukt samiksha kii
 This high-level joint team also inspected the routes of the Amarnath Yatra and reviewed security arrangements at important places
 amarnath yatra ke dauraan baukhalaaye aatanki apni maujuudagi dikhaane ke liye kuch bhi kar sakate hai
 Intelligence agencies are well aware of such plans of terrorists
 yahi kaaran he ki is baar blike cat commandos ko amarnath yatriyon kii suraksha kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya he
 It should be noted that 238 companies of security personnel and a large contingent of Jammu and Kashmir Police are already deployed in the security of Amarnath Yatris
 enesji ko yahaan lagane kii vajahasarkaar amarnath yatriyon kii suraksha main jaraa si bhi dheel kii gunjaaish nahin chhodana chaahati
 This is the reason that along with increasing the number of security forces this time, NSG commandos have also been deployed to protect the passengers
 agar pakistani aatanki suraksha ghere ko todakar hamale main kaamyaab ho gaye or sarkaar se saudebaaji ke liye yatriyon ko bandhak banane kii sajeesh rachi to aisi sajeesh kii chindiyaan udaane ke liye enesji commandos behad jaruri hai
 Along with NSG, CRPF companies are also keeping a close watch on the journey route
 baahar se ai siarpief kii companiyon ko kashmir ke halaat se rubaru karaane ke liye pehle hi 3 dinon kaa krash course karaayaa ja chukaa he or jawan har aatanki hamale se nipatane ke liye puri tarah taiyaar hai
 In fact, the two-way Amarnath Yatra, originating from Baltal and Pahalgam, starts from South Kashmir and South Kashmir has been the hub of terrorists for some time
 isi ke chalate khufia agenciyon ko shaq he ki ye aatanki amarnath yatriyon ko nishaanaa bana sakate hai
 But the security forces are completely ready to thwart every terrorist plot
 kashmir main tainaat honge aatankiyon ke 'yamraj', palak jhapakate hi hoga khatmapichley saal bhi hua tha hamalimarnaathyatriyon par pichley saal bhi aatanki hamalaa hua tha jisamen 7 shraddhaluon kii jaan chali gai thi
 This time too, the great danger of terrorist conspiracy is hovering over the Amarnath Yatra
 khufia agenciyon ko khabar lagi he ki sarhad ke is paar or us paar, donon taraf aasthaa kii is yatra ke khilaaf gahari sajeesh rachi ja rahi he
 On July 10 last year, the terrorists attacked the devotees who went out on the Amarnath Yatra
 amarnath yatra se laut rahi kareeb 50 shraddhaluon se bhari ek bas par pakistani aatankiyon ne anantnag main andhadhundh goliyaan barasaa di
 Seven devotees were killed in the attack, around 20 passengers were injured
 bijepi adhyaksh nitin gadakari kii company ko lekar taaja khulaason ke mutabik gadakari ne usee form ko udhaar diya, jisane unke purti samooh main paisa lagaaya tha

 regency equifin kii balance shit kahati he ki gadakari ne unhen 26 lakh rupee udhaar die
 The loss-making Purti company later gave a loan of Rs 95 lakh to Regency Equifin
 udhar, iskar vibhaag ne mumbai or pune main gadakari kii company purti power and sugar limited ke khaaton kii jaanch shuru kar di he
 The Income Tax Department will soon submit a report to the Central Board of Direct Taxes in this regard
 iskar vibhaag gadakari kii company ko mili fund ke strot kaa pataa karegaa, saath hi un 18 companiyon kii padtaal karegaa, jinhone purti main paisa lagaaya tha
 Soon these companies will also be called for questioning
 pehali najar main yah lag rahaa he ki purti main paisa lagane vaali kai companiyaan farji thim
 Income tax officers can also call Nitin Gadkari for questioning if needed
 enditivi ko yah bhi khabar mili he ki gadakari kii companiyon main paisa lagane ke maamle main centre ke company maamalon ke mantralay ne jaanch shuru kar di he
 It is reported from sources that initial investigations are being done by the Registrar of Companies in Nagpur and Mumbai
 jaanch main koi khami paae jane par gadakari kii companiyon ke maamle kii jaanch company maamalon ke mantralay kii special frod unit ko saunpi ja sakati he

 'pojishan badalane se ballebaaji par fark nahin
 
 
 Kohli was asked if his batting was affected by the change in batting position, saying, "no, it didn't matter to my batting
" agar aap lagaataar acha pradarshan karte ho to log chaahate hai ki aap har match main aisa karo
 i cannot score a century in every match
 jahaan tak main jaanata hum ki to ballebaaji main main jo kar rahaa hum or meri jis tarah kii maansikta he, use dekhte hue main kisi bhi cheez ko lekar chintit nahin hum
 '' Every match has an exam

 'kohli said,' For us each match is like a test

 a post shared by varun dhawan alia bhatt (@varia_fc_) on Jan 15, 2018 at 10:46am PSTA post shared by Gully Boy (@gully_boy_fc) on Jan 15, 2018 at 9:13am PST Sachin Tendulkar, one of the greatest batsmen in the world, has chosen the Mumbai Wankhede ground among his favorite audience to play the 200th and last Test match of his career, but Sachin's record at Wankhede has not been as good as his illustrious career
 sachin apane 24 varsho ke cricket kariyar main shatakon kaa shatak laga chuke hai, lekin vah nervas ninties kaa shikaar anek baar hue hai, or vankhede par to unke saath aisa sarvaadhik baar hua he
 Despite all this, Mumbai is his hometown, and Tendulkar has probably chosen Mumbai for his farewell test so that his unwell mother can see him playing for the last time on the field
 vmumbai ke vankhede main guuruuvaar se shuru ho rahe test match main sachin ko na sirf puri duniya main faile unke prashansak balki samakaksh khilaadiyon sahit vipakshi team westeindies ke captain darren saimi bhi shatak lagaataa dekhnaa chaahate hai, lekin sachin ko vankhede par bahut sajag rahanaa padegaa kyonki kai baar vah acha score banane baavjood use shatak main nahin badal paae hai
 Despite scoring twice between 60 and 70, once between 70 and 80 and 90 runs on Sachin Wankhede, he has been deprived of scoring hundreds of times
 lekin vankhede sachin ke liye unke kariyar kii sabase badi uplabdhi bhi lekar aayaa he, jab 2011 main isi maidan par sachin ko apane kariyar kaa pehla vishwacap uthaane kaa mauka bhi mila
 Sachin's record in first class matches at Wankhede has been excellent, where he has scored a record 3534 runs with an innings of 233 not out
 lekin vankhede par khele gaye kul 10 test maichon main 47
 Sachin has been able to score 847 runs at an average of 05, including his innings of 148 runs against Sri Lanka in 1996–97
 sachin ne vankhede par kheli gai apni antim chaar pariyon main 94, 3, 8, 8 ran banaae hai
 The opposition team was still the West Indies when Sachin was the last victim of nervous nights at Wankhede
 ravi rampaul kii gend par saimi ke kaich lete hi tab bhi vankhede sann rah gaya tha
 But this time Wankhede wants to break that silence and drown in celebration

 chhattisgarh main monsoon ke sakriya nahin hone se logon kii bechaini bad gai he
 Right now the situation remains as if a period of intense heat is going on
 rajya ke tamaam ilaako ke taapmaana 42 or 43 degree ke bich sthir he
 Due to the heat and humidity, people are worried, usually in the first week of June, the state of rain starts
 lekin isbaar naa to pre monsoon vaali barish hui or naa hi monsoon ke samay par aane ke asaar dikh rahe hai
 According to MS Kerkatar, the director of the state's agriculture department, generally ten centimeters of rain is required for sowing
 varanaa bijo kaa ankuran prabhavit hone kii ashanka bad jaati hai philhal monsoon ke rukh ko dekhte hue unhone kisaano ko barish kaa intjaar karne ko kaha he
 In many parts of Chhattisgarh, farmers have faced drought for two consecutive years

 In Chhattisgarh, preparation of paddy sowing has been done in an area of more than 70 thousand hectares
 jo kii pichley varsh kii tulana main 60 hajaar hectare zyada he
 Farmers across the state have prepared sowing
 kai ilaako main kisaano ne uria bhi sahej kar rakhaa he
 But they are surprised by the travesty of monsoon
 bastar or sarguja sambhag ke zydaatar hisson main pichley 48 ghanto main halke badal chhaae hai
 There have been drizzles anywhere but there was no heavy rain, which is needed most
 mausam vibhaag kii maane to aane vaale teen chaar dinon main barish kii sambhaavna he
 At present, farmers are staring at the sky in the hope of rain

 note:bhartee sambandhit diarect link par pahunchane ke liye yahanclikaren Rahul Gandhi was accompanied by senior Congress leader Randeep Surjewala at the press conference
 rahul gandhi ne apni press conference se pehle patrakaron se halke andaaj main poocha bhi ki aaplog to dabaav main nahin hai? mood thik to he na? takreeban 18 minute press conference chali or is dauraan rahul gandhi ne sirf notebandi or rafel par apni baat rakhi
 After not joining the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) alliance, Congress has started devising its own strategy for Uttar Pradesh in the wake of Lok Sabha elections
 jab gulam nabi aaazaad ne yah kaha ki party rahul gandhi ke netritv main puri shakti se apni vichaardhaara kaa paalan karte hue yah chunaav loksabhaa ladegi or bhartiya janata party ko parajeet karegi
 So there are two strategies
 pehali congress uttar pradesh main apane pairon par khadi hona chaah rahi he
 Second, it is seeking to dent the bjp's base which is essentially a Brahmin vote and the slipping of it will ensure the victory of the SP-BSP alliance
 yani ek tarah se upi main bhaajapa-virdohi dal muslim voton ke dhruvikaran or hindu voton kaa jatigat taur par bikharaav chaah rahe hai
 This is also because the electoral alliance with SP has backfired in 2017
 philhal, congress kah rahi he ki uttar pradesh kii sabhi 80 siton par vah akeli chunaav ladegi
 And the election results will be shocking
 philhal, party ke andruni sutron ke mutabik, congress amethi, raibareli, sultanpur, barabanki, dhaurahaa, pratapgarh, kanpur, unnav, kushinagar, muradabad, bareli, lakhanu, varanasi, elahabaad, farrukhabad, saharanpur, jonpur mathura faijabad or fatehpur sikri par apana dhyaan kendrit karegi
 Even if one assumes that the Congress will contest 80 seats in UP due to not being included in the opposition alliance, there is little confidence in its statement
 yah aatmavishvaas teen rajyon main uski satta main vaapasi se aayaa he, jisamen madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main to 15 saal ke baad jeet hasil hui he
 Obviously, this has also encouraged the enthusiasm of the Congress workers of Uttar Pradesh
 is soobe main congress satta se 29 saal se dur he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha too, the Congress was in a miserable condition and only Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi were able to win their seats
 narayan dutt tiwari soobe ke aakhri congressi mukhyamantri the
 He remained the Chief Minister till December 1989 and after that the Congress began to fall in the state
 uttar pradesh main jis bhaajapa virdohi gathbandhan ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe the, usamen haalia chunavi jeet ke baad se congress ne apane liye takreeban barabari kii siton kii maang kii thi
 Clearly, there was no scope for the Congress to spread its footing in the coordination between the SP and the BSP, in which RLD was also to be accommodated
 lekin yaheen par aakar fachchar funs gaya
 In fact, the SP and the BSP have occupied the political space vacated by the Congress in Uttar Pradesh
 congress kaa paramparaagat vot bank muslim, dalit or brahmanon kaa tha or sapa or basapa ne iske bade hisse ko todakar aapas main baant liya he
 In particular, the Muslim vote bank of the Congress has been largely destroyed in Uttar Pradesh
 uttar pradesh main kul aabaadi kaa 18
 Muslims constitute 5 per cent, Dalits are around 20
 5 fisadi hai or brahman 9
 2 percent
 musalmaan voter sapa kii taraf mud gaye, basapa ke hisse dalit aae or brahmanon ne bhaajapa ko chun liya
 The SP-BSP has insisted on non-congress, non-bjp alliances at the moment, but if they win, there will be synergy and alliance possibilities after the election
 basapa supremeo mayawati chunaav purv gathbandhanon main kshetreey dalon ko saath lene par jor detii hai or aisa unhone karnataka, chhattisgarh or haryana main kiya he
 So is the situation in Uttar Pradesh similar to Bihar in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections? When Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal and Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party gave the Congress only three seats
 congress ne tab bihar main sabhi siton par chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya tha or iskaa phayda endie ko mila tha
 However, the Congress has announced to contest all the 80 seats in UP
 par, congress, sapa, basapa or ajit singh kii ralod ke milane se soobe main muslim, jat, jatav or yadav vot ek saath ho jate
 The BJP is already surrounded by apprehensions in UP and that alliance will make the fight for 2019 even more stringent
 is gathbandhan kaa ankaganit 50 fisadi voton kaa hota or bhaajapa ko 42
 Only 3 percent of the vote is there
 aisa lag rahaa he ki maujuuda gathjod se uttar pradesh main hinduon ke vot jati ke aadhaar par bantenge or muslim vot pehle se adhik dhruvikrut hokar padegaa
 The Congress has decided to contest all the seats but it should have noticed that the electoral land of Uttar Pradesh is not two polar like Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan
 yahaan bahudaleey bahukoniya mukaable honge, or nattejey bhi usee tarah se aade vaale hai
 Not only this, the biggest challenge of the Congress will also be to choose 80 such names in the state, who will want to contest on the Congress ticket for the Lok Sabha elections
 soobe ke zyaadaatar ilaakon main congress party ke daftar yaa unki kamity bhi nahin he
 Congress has lost its cadres at the grassroots level
 sapa-basapa congress ko saath nahin laayi kyonki mulaayam singh yadav khuleam kah chuke hai ki 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko saath lene se sapa ko bade paimaane par apana janaadhar khona padaa tha
 One of the screws is perhaps that the Congress, enthused by the victory in three states, will now put forward Rahul Gandhi as the prime ministerial candidate and why would Akhilesh Yadav or Mayawati want this? If the Congress has to make a strong comeback in national politics then elections alone Fighting will be beneficial under a long-term strategy
 2009 main uttar pradesh main bhaajapa kii bhi mahaj 10 siton hi thim
 In such a situation, Congress should take a lesson from Amit Shah's aggressive and fine election campaign
 2014 or 2017 main unki ranneeti ne bhaajapa kaa pradarshan sudhara hi nahin, parinaam bhi prachand aae
 Over and above, it seems that the SP-BSP did not bring the Congress along and the Congress is a little spoiled by it
 par siyaasi galiyaaron ke sutara bataa rahe hai ki vipaksh ne jaanboojhkar congress ko saath nahin liya he or congress kai jagahon par apane votakatwa ummidavaar khadi karegi
 This will be beneficial for the SP-BSP alliance
 baharhaal, akele sabhi siton par chunaav ladane kaa faisla congress kii majaburi ho yaa sochaa-samajha faisla, yah tay he ki chunaav sirf ankaganit nahin hote
 If the BJP with 10 Lok Sabha seats can return to power by a staggering majority by 71 and after 15 years, then the long-term policies for the Congress can also have results

 Do you see a woman wearing a sari or wearing a short top, because she has stretch marks on her waist and abdomen
 
 
 yaa phir aap garbhvatee hai or stretch marcus ke bare main soch-soch kar pareshaan hoti rahati hai, to ab pareshaani ko kahen by-by or apanaaie kuch kargar upaay
 
 
 Whenever someone is fat, a sudden change in the body and a stretch in the skin causes several scars on the skin (stretch Marks: Common Causes and How to Get Rid of Them), which are called stretch marks
 akasar stretch marcus kaa matlab pregnancy ke dauraan mahilaon ke pet va jaanghon par ho jane vaale nishaanon ko hi mana jaataa he, lekin vah har nishaan jo motaape ke kaaran twachaa main aae khinchaav or kasaav ke kaaran utpann hota he stretch mark kehalaata he
 Stretch marks can be for anyone, there is no age or sex limit
 saamanyat: stretch mark bagal, pet, stan, jaanghon, hips or nitambon par hote hai, kyonki motopa hone par sharir ke isi bhaag par sabase zyada charbi yaa kahen ki vasa badhane se twachaa main khichaav utpann hota he
 There are many treatments to avoid these stretch marks such as surgery etc
 But it is best to take care before they occur
 akasar dekha jaataa he ki garbhvatee mahilaayein garbhadhaaran ke dauraan twachaa main aane vaale badlaavon or pareshaaniyon ko andekha karti hai, jabaki aisa karnaa stretch marcus ko khulaa nimantran dena he
 If you are to avoid stretch marks, be aware of changes in the skin
 twachaa main khujali kaa hona aise main aam baat he, par vahaan par khujali na karen
 Keep using a good powder or moisturizer, this will help you reduce itching
 vaise bazaar main anek tarah ke stretch mark cream uplabdh hai jinke prayog se nishaanon ko hone se roka ja saktaa he
 Women also drink as much water during pregnancy as on normal days
 garbhavastha main ve prayaapt pani nahin piti
 This habit does not prove to be right for them, because the lack of sufficient moisture in the skin increases the stretch more
 garbhvatee mahila ke liye yah behad jaruri he ki vah twachaa main prayaapt hydration or nami ke liye adhik se adhik pani kaa seven karen
 Along with drinking more water, there is another better way to control starch markus
 vah he aapaki diet
 Garbwati women should not cross the limit of need
 doctoron ke anusaar 11
 Weight should be increased from 5 to 16 kg, if the forest is growing more, then good and balance diet is needed
 isliye apane khaane se junk food ko kahen by-by or nutrishnal khaane ko apanaaen
 Foods that contain vitamins A, c and d will prove to be better for you and your skin
 isi ke saath hai protein vaala bhojan twachaa ko stretch marcus se bachaa kar rakhega
 Exercise regularly to protect your skin from the symptoms of stretch
 aisa karne se twachaa ko bina kisi pareshaani ke failane main sahaayta to milegi hi saath hi aapkaa vajan bhi niyantran main rahegaa
 Turmeric For Skin: Follow Natural anti-aging Turmeric Facepack, Read the Benefits of Turmeric
 
 
 garbhavastha main jo ek vyakti aapkaa sachcha saathi he vah he aapkaa doctor
 At this time, consult your doctor for the smallest problem
 stech mark kii samasya ke liye apane doctor se milen vah nishchit hi aapako aapke sharir kii jarurat ke anusaar diet yaa nutrishan degaa
 The texture of the skin also depends on whether or not a stretch markus is present
 oili twachaa kii bajaae dry twachaa par stretch marcus jaldi hote hai
 So if your skin is dry, then it is important to give it moisture according to regular needs
 alovira, nariyal tel, angoor ke bijon, vitamin i, pro- vitamin bi-5 or aroma telon se twachaa ko nami den
 All these oils will reduce the skin's essential moisturization and will also protect against stretch marks
 garbhavastha ke dauraan jo bhi kapade pahane ve dhile or aaramdaayak hi hone chahien
 Take care of your bra the most
 adhik kasi hui yaa thili bra bilkul na pahanen
 The inner clothes should be such that you feel comfortable instead of trouble

 homeland security vibhaag ne ek email ke zariye in khabaron par koi bhi tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya Adolescence is the stage of age when a person feels full of new energy
 par is baat se bhi inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki yahi wo umr bhi hoti he jab bachche apane mata-pita se baaten chhipaana shuru kar dete hai
 Parents also have an idea that their children are hiding something from them, but they do not understand how to talk to them about it
 smart parents bakhubi jaanate hai ki unhen apane bacchon ko kis tarah se deal karnaa he
 But many parents remain in the dark
 aise main agar ye pataa chal jaae ki bachche kin baton par jhooth bol sakate hai to mata-pita ke liye apane bachche ko sambhaal paanaa aasaan ho jayega
 Here are some similar things about which children often lie to their parents
 1
 In adolescence, children often fall in love with someone
 darasal, ye pyaar kam or aakarshan adhik hota he lekin apane afaire ko lekar wo sirf apane doston par hi bharosa karte hai
 They never tell this thing to their parents
 2
 With adolescence, children begin to explore a different space
 unka apana club or group ban jaataa he
 With whom they party, but this party is secret
 ve apane mata-pita ko kabhi bhi apni is outing ke bare main nahin bataate hai
 3
 class banks karne kii himmat bhi isi umr main aati he
 Children keep hidden things from parents by bunking class or going around with friends or going shopping with a friend
 4
 On the one hand, while the parents keep on thinking about the news of the children, they give them mobiles, while the children use it more to chat with friends and change dps on Facebook
 ye baat bhi maa-baap se chhipi hi rahati he
 5
 maa-baap hameshaa chaahate hai ki unke bacchon kii sangati acchhee ho
 For this, they like to see their child along with the class topper children, but every child has some secret friends
 jinke bare main unke maa-baap ko kuch bhi pataa nahin hota he
