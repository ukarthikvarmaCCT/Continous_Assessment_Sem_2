 The market regulator Sebi plans to make it difficult for willful defaulters (willful defaulters) and their companies to raise funds from the capital markets
 sebi fanse karj yani gaiyr-nishpadit aastiyon ke khilaaf sarkaar or bhartiya rigerv bank kii ladaai main sahyog dene ke liye yah kadam uthaa rahaa he
 The proposed move to this effect is likely to be considered in the upcoming SEBI meeting
 is kadam kaa uddeshy yahi he ki is tarah ke karjadaaron ke liye pratibhuti bazaar se or dhan jutanaa mushkil banaaya jaae, saath hi chhot niveshkon ke hiton kii raksha kii jaae
 It is noteworthy that on non-payment of existing loans, banks declare many units as 'willful defaulters' and stop lending to them
 aisi ikaiyaan uske baad share or band bazaar main logon se paisa jutati hai
 In such a situation, many small investors get trapped because they do not know about the 'defaulter' of that company
 tippaniyan However, there is also an opinion that a complete ban on the raising of funds by such entities would be a problem for the promoters seeking to infuse new funds into a listed company
 isse alpaansh hissedaaron ke hit prabhavit ho sakate hai
 SEBI will consider taking any steps while balancing the matter

 Few knew the secret that his greatness was due to his sons, who embodied unimaginable cruelty
 sari zamin par unka qabza tha or puure gaanv kaa pet unki krupa par hi chalata tha
 The sons used to recover and like that people had to starve for many days
 upar se maar padati so alag
 People raced Chaudhary's antechamber bled in the hands of sons
 unke pairon par gir jate
 Chaudhary used to call his sons and reprimand the Surrey mangoes
 kehete ki maanavtaa mar gai he tumhaari, tum bhi dub maro
 Look at how poor you are
 are koi ise pani pilaao
 Then go and say to the villagers who are badly crushed, half your forgiveness
 boodha bechaara choudhary ke kadam chuumane lagata or jindabad ke naare lagata
 Chaudhary's sons used to get angry and go inside
 or unka shikaar dard ke baavjood muskuraataa ghar lautataa
 However, half-forgiveness would have meant that the number of nights spent starving would have been half

 ) Senior Congress leader and MP from Thiruvananthapuram, Shashi Tharoor said on Wednesday that he never justified Modi, but he has been an outspoken critic of the BJP government, after the controversy over the statement made in alleged praise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 
 piem modi kii kathith prashansa par kerala pradesh congress cameti ke adhyaksh mullapalli ramchandran dwaara maange gaye spashtikaran par email se diye jawaab main purv kendriya mantri tharur ne kaha, ‘‘main modi sarkaar kaa mukhar aalochak rahaa hum or ummid karata hum ki main sakaaratmak aalochak rahaa hum
 "you know, Tharoor had said that if the Prime Minister is doing the right thing then he should be praised
" iske baad rajya kii raajnneeti main bhuuchaal aa gaya
 In an email sent to Tharoor, Ramachandran said that party president Sonia Gandhi had expressed Congress's stand on Narendra Modi during the 75th birth anniversary celebrations of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
 kerala congress adhyaksh ne kaha, ‘‘modi sarkaar sabhi morchon par asafal he
 Even the Deputy Chairman of NITI Aayog has said that the country is going through the worst economic crisis since independence
 '' ramchandran ne kaha ki rashtriya namoona surveykshan sanghathan (eneseso) ne kaha he ki desh main pichley 45 saal main berogari sabase charam par he
 When the country is going through such a crisis, it is unfortunate to justify the Prime Minister
 tharur is samay videsh main hai
 In his reply, he said that he never justified Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee should study his recent speeches in Parliament
 tharur ne kaha ki ramchandran rajya se kisi ek bhi netaa kaa naam bataaen jisane sansad main pesh kiye gayi prayek vidheyak par adhyayan, anusandhan karne or modi sarkaar ke virodh main unke prayaason kaa kam se kam das pratishat bhi kiya ho
 He said that he has interfered in Parliament more than 50 times and has expressed his courage and determination against 17 Bills
 congress saansad ne kaha, ‘‘kya kerala main meraa koi bhi aalochak kah saktaa he ki unhone aisa kiya he?'' unhone kaha, ‘‘maine modi sarkaar ke pehle kaarykaal main sabase samgr or safal aalochana ke liye lekhak ke taur par apni kalam or pramanikta kii shakti kaa istemaal kiya
 In reference to the controversy over his statement, Tharoor said that it is a controversy based on extreme reactions to head-to-head reporting on a tweet
 unhone kaha, ‘‘maine jairam ramesh or abhishek singhvi ke samarthan karne vaale bayaan jari kiye jinaki party ke prabhaavshaalee netaaon or eisisi ke aadhikarik pravaktaaon ke taur par pahchaan se aap or main, donon waakif hai
 "tharoor said that he has been arguing for the last six years that" Modi should be praised whenever he speaks or does something good, it will also increase the credibility of our criticisms on his mistake
 " '' unhone kaha, ‘‘modi ne prashansa laayak bahut kam kaam kiya he
 But he has been effective in increasing his vote percentage in India from 31 percent in 2014 to 37 percent in 2019, and in such a situation, we should understand why this happened in Congress, which was reduced to around 19 percent in both elections
 ''tharur ne kaha, ‘‘saaf taur par badi sankhya main matadaataaon ne sochaa ki vah unke liye kaam kar rahe hai
 We have to accept this, but also outline its limits
 haa, unhone shauchalay banawaye, lekin 60 pratishat main pani nahin aa rahaa
 Yes, they gave gas cylinders to poor rural women, but 92 percent of women could not afford another cylinder
 '' unhone apane jawaab main saaf kiya ki agar ham aise prastut karenge ki modi ne kuch nahin kiya, balki galat hi rahe or logon ne phir bhi unke liye vot diya to ham kah rahe hai ki janata murkh he, is rukh par aap vot hasil nahin kar sakate
 Tharoor urged the party leadership to take necessary steps to bring the Congress back to power, saying that for this the party would have to focus on the topics that led the voters to turn to Modi
 tharur ne is ‘bina baat ke vivaad' main bhi unke saath khadey rahane ke liye kerala or deshbhar ke saamaanya congress kaaryakartaaon kaa bhi shukriya adaa kiya

 According to Pathak, the policy of the Narendra Modi government is clear that Pakistan should be given a befitting reply to the cross-border firing
 unke saath associat editor rahul treepathi kii baatcheet ke anshahis achaanak or baari golabari kii vajah kya he?ham bhi is sawaal kaa jawaab khoj rahe hai
 It started on 2 October, when they fired at our border posts
 agle din dashahra tha, us din unhone hamaare gaanvon par gole daage or hamane bhi jaise ko taisa jawaab diya
 There was peace for some time, but the night before Eid, they started firing again
 or unhone hamaare upar jitne gole daage, usase zyada gaanvvaalon par gole barasaaye
 Has the BSF changed its policy on firing on the border after the NDA government came in? The Prime Minister, Defense Minister and Home Minister have clearly stated the government's stand
 or mujhe isse zyada kuch kehane kii jarurat nahin he
 Pakistan has alleged that India broke the ceasefire due to which the situation on the border deteriorated
 uksaave kii pehali karrwai unhone kii
 We just answered in their language
 biguef ladaai ke oonche takaajon kaa paalan karata he or ham aam logon ko kabhi nishaanaa nahin banaate
 People living nearby may be feared to be harmed
 lekin pakistani rangers ne to sidhe hamaare aam logon ko nishaanaa banaaya
 Most of the firing has taken place in the RS Pura sector where we are densely populated

 Last year, militants attacked a military camp and a police station in Samba
 pichley do saal main seemaa se koi ghuspaith nahin hui

 lekin ve kaamyaab nahin huin
 As far as the attack in Samba is concerned, no one can say for sure where the terrorists entered from
 lekin ve seemaa se to nahin ghuse the
 Did the BSF get agitated after two soldiers were injured in the first IED blast and it came under heavy fire? We have not received such reports from anywhere
 yah kahana galat he ki hamane pehle golabari shuru kii
 Not only this, there were reports of the IED blast being on the Line of Control, but the firing started at the border
 isliye donon ghatnaon main koi sambandh khoj paanaa mushkil he
 How many battalions are currently deployed along the border? Have you asked for more pieces? i cannot give you information about the deployment
 keval itnaa hi kah saktaa hum ki itani paryaapt sankhya he jisase ham apane aadesh kaa paalan kar saken
 We are giving them a befitting reply
 asal main hamane zyada gole daage hai
 How long will it take for the situation on the border to become normal? It is up to them (pakistan)
 ham to keval jawaab de rahe hai
 We have to protect our border and population

 The Supreme Court may have spoken of banning caste rallies, but Congress seems to have faith in caste to win
 rajasthan main in dinon congress ke ummidavaari kaa form baanta ja rahaa he
 This time from AICC, ticket seekers have to fill the form in which they have to tell how many people of which caste and religion live in your area and which candidate and caste will be in front of you
 form main paanch panne kii detail main ye bhi bataanaa he ki aap kis jati or dharm ke hai
 The way caste and religion have been given importance on every page of this form, it seems clear that this time Congress will distribute tickets on the basis of its buffalo
 lekin form baantanevaale congress padaadhikari bhi ise galat bataa rahe hai

 The country wants to know how Rs 2,645 crore
 kaa ghaataa 1
 76 lakh crore Rs
 ke anumaanit ghate main tabdeel ho gaya
 "information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari roared like this at a press conference on 24 November in Chandigarh
 isse thik ek din pehle niyantrak or mahalekha pareekshak (sieji) karyaalay se sevanivruth mahanideshak aar
 P
 singh ne apane puraane daawey ko doharaaya tha ki unki jaanch ke tareeke main 2ji spectrum aavanton main anumaanit ghaataa sirf 2,645 karod ru
 Was, which was rejected by CAG Vinod Rai
 singh ne apni baton main aisa bhi ishaara kiya ki lok lekha samiti (piesi) ke adhyaksh or bijepi netaa murali manohar joshi ne sieji ke akalan ko prabhavit kiya he
 However, Joshi has denied these allegations
 singh ke aarope ne congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko bhi 2ji ghotaale par apni ab tak kii pehali tippanee karne ke liye utsahit kar diya
 He said that bjp's politics has opened up due to Singh's words
 singh ne baad main apane sankethik aaropon ko yah kehete hue waapas le liya ki media ne unki baton ko 'galat dhang se pesh’ kiya
 But this did not affect the Congress and it started repeating Kapil Sibal's infamous "zero Loss Theory", which was badly beaten two years ago
 aisa karke party ne apni hi kalai khol di
 Contrary to the claims of Tiwari and Singh, the CAG never said that the amount of damages in the scam was 1
 76 lakh karod ru
 Was only yah aankada to sieji kii report main die gaye chaar anumaanon se ek tha (dekhen box: sieji ne kya kaha)
 Carefully reading page 54 of this report, it is clear that the CAG did not insist on any one of these four estimates being accurate
 report main kaha gaya he, ''audit main yah phir doharaaya jaataa he ki 2ji spectrum kii sahi keemat sirf bazaar aadhaarit prabhavi prakriya se tay ho sakati thi, jiske abhaav main ye (chaar anumaan) aise sanketak hai, jo ishaara karte hai ki sarkaar ko sambhavat: kitna nuksaan hua hoga
 The CAG was very transparent about its objectives
 report ke prishth 56 par kaha gaya he, ''audit kii koshish sirf yahi ujagar karnaa he ki khule bazaar kii prakriya se spectrum kii keemat tay karne par kahin zyada keemat milti or usase sarkaar kii aamadani zyada hoti
 "if Tiwari had read Chapter 6 of the report, he would have also seen that while the CAG spoke of the deficit in very clear terms, he welcomed the open debate on the estimate of the deficit
 report main kaha gaya, ''2ji spectrum aavanton main sarkari khajaane ko nuksaan hone kii baat nakaaree nahin ja sakati
 But the amount of damage was debated
 ”auditor ne antim rup se jo chaar anumaan saamne rakhe the, unke bare main singh kaa daawa he ki unhone may, 2010 main sieji ko likhit rup se inhen khaarij karne ke liye kaha tha
 According to Singh, he rejected the assessment made on the basis of the open offer of STEL because the motion was withdrawn in the High Court
 unhone 1
 76 lakh crore Rs
 ke mul aankade ko bhi nakaar diya
 If you look for only 122 licenses, then that figure is actually 1
 02 lakh karod ru
 While 35 dual-technology licenses granted in 2007 and 6
 2 megahertz kii tay seemaa se adhik spectrum aavanton se hone vaale ghate kaa anumaan 74,000 karod ru
 Was
 unka tark yah tha ki 2ji spectrum kii keemat kii tulana 3ji spectrum se nahin kii ja sakati
 The Supreme Court rejected this argument in February 2012, revoking 122 GSM licenses
 singh ne sieji kii chaar paddatiyon main do sabase taarkik paddatiyon ko bhi khaarij kiya
 These two CAG estimates were based on Unitech and Swan's equity selling price
 donon ne license paane ke 12 maheenon main hi videshi niveshkon ko hissedari bechi thi
 Singh argues that both these cases were of legitimate foreign direct investment (FDI), which was also approved by the Ministry of Finance and private companies neither benefited nor the government suffered any loss
 singh kaa yah tark bhi bedam he
 The two companies had no other assets other than spectrum, nor had any expertise regarding the telecom sector
 telenor or etisalaat ne aktubar or disambar, 2008 main kiye gaye equity saudon main 1,658 karod ru
 (the then Minister of Communications A
 raja ne jo shulk lagaaya tha) se kaaphi oonchi keemat par equity hissedari kharidi
 It is clear that compared to the price Raja put in 2008, the market gave a much higher price for that spectrum
 sieji ne unitech kii hissedari beche jane kii keemat ke aadhaar par 57,000 karod ru
 69,000 crore based on the shareholding of Ka and Swan
 ke nuksaan kaa akalan rakhaa tha
 CAG added 35 dual-license licenses and 6 at the 2001 price in 2007, while adding a total loss
 2 megahertz kii tay seemaa se zyada mili spectrum kii keemat ko bhi liya tha
 Even if we remove them from the total losses, the loss due to the 122 licenses canceled by the Supreme Court, Unitech's 67
 25 fisadi hissedari telenor ko beche jane kii keemat ke aadhaar par 40,000 karod ru
 And Rs 33,000 crore based on the sale of Swan's 50 per cent stake to Etisalat
 hoti he
 Both these figures amounted to cbi's Rs 31,000 crore
 ke anumaanit nuksaan ke kareeb hai
 The principle of zero loss remains as bad as it was two years ago

 bharat or bangladesh ne lambey samay se chali aa rahi seemaa samasya ko us samay hal kar liya jab donon deshon ne jamini seemaa ke simakan or ek duusare ke desh ke 162 ilaakon ke aadan pradaan par aitihaasik samjhaute par hastakshar kiye
 But there was no agreement on the sharing of Teesta and Feni river waters with the glow of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's first visit
 bangladesh kii apni samakaksh shaikh hasina se mulaakaat karne vaale singh ne haalanki kaha ki donon deshon ne faisla kiya he ki ve tista or feni nadiyon ke pani ke bantwaare ko lekar parsparik taur par sahmati vaale, upyukt or sauhardpurn samjhaute par pahunchane ke liye charchaa jari rakhenge
 As part of a move to satisfy Bangladesh unhappy with the Teesta River Water Treaty being removed from negotiations at the last minute, Singh announced the immediate implementation of duty-free imports of 61 items from Bangladesh to Indian markets
 iske alaava bangladeshiyon ko teen bigha galiyare se 24 ghante awajahi kii ijaajat di
 Of the 61 items that were approved for import, 46 are textile products for which Bangladesh has sought access to Indian markets
 tista nadi par antarim samjhaute par pahunchane main asafalataa ko lekar bangladesh kii samvedansheeltaa se waakif singh ne kaha, ‘hamaari saajha nadiyon ko asantosh kii vajah nahin bananaa chahie balki unhen hamaare donon deshon kii samruddhi kaa agradoot hona chahie
 'both sides were to sign the sharing of river water during Singh's visit, but India had to withdraw at the last moment due to strong objections by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee over the draft agreement
 singh ne kaha, ‘hamane tista or feni nadiyon ke pani ke bantwaare ko lekar parsparik taur par sweekaarya, upyukt or sauhardpurvak samjhaute par pahunchane ke liye vichaar vimarsh jari rakhane kaa faisla kiya he
 Earlier, due to lack of agreement on the Teesta river, the difference in india-bangladesh relations was felt when Indian High Commissioner Rajiv Mittar, posted in Dhaka, was called by the Bangladesh Foreign Ministry to express deep disappointment and frustration on the issue
 mittar ne spasht kiya ki tista samjhaute par isliye hastakshar nahin ho paye kyonki is mudde par bharat main aantarik vichaar vimarsh puraa nahin ho paaya he
 He told the Bangladeshi Foreign Ministry Foreign Secretary Mizarul Kais shortly before Manmohan Singh arrived in Dhaka that the Teesta treaty would be signed as soon as the internal discussions are over
 gauratlab he ki atal bihari vaajapeyi kii 1999 kii yatra ke baad kisi bhartiya pradhanmantri kii yah pehali bangladesh yatra he
 It is seen as finding new foundations in bilateral relationships and finding new dimensions in relationships
 donon deshon ke pradhanmantri kii maujuudagi main videsh mantri es em krishna or unke bangladeshi samakaksh deepu moni ne bhoomi seemaa sambandhi samjhaute par hastakshar kiye
 Under this agreement, the two countries demarcated the entire land and solved the problem of the status of their areas located in each other's country
 bharat or bangladesh ke bich 4096 kilometre lambii seemaa he jo pashchim bengal, assam, tripura, meghalaya or mizoram se lagi hui he

 in kshetron main takreeban 51,000 logon kii aabaadi he
 For decades, the issue of these areas has been the cause of sour relations between india-bangladesh relations and today the decision in this regard was the most important event of Singh's visit
 1974 ke baad yah doosraa mauka he jab bharat apane bhukhand kaa kuch hissaa duusare desh ko dene ke liye taiyaar hua he
 Earlier, India gave the island of Kachchthivu to Sri Lanka

 Other agreements include conservation of the Sundarbans, conservation of the Royal Bengal tiger, cooperation between fisheries and cattle, audiovisual media, Dhaka University- Jawaharlal Nehru University and agreement on the Institute of Fashion Techniques in both countries

 com / mmczyqmr84 — Sanjay Raut (@ rautsanjay61) November 14, 2019 rajasthan bhaajapa ke adhyaksh madan laal saini ne mughal badshaah akbar ko lekar vivaadaaspad bayaan diya he
 He has accused Akbar of sexual harassment
 akbar ke charitra par sawaal uthaate hue saini ne kaha ki usne bikaner ke raja kii patni kiran kumari ke saath minaa bazaar main chhedchhad kii koshish kii thi
 In the BJP office in Jaipur on the occasion of Maharana Pratap's birth anniversary, Saini claimed that Meena Bazaar was infamous for Akbar's dirty antics
 ise akbar raaj main shuru kiya gaya tha
 Saini said in the statement, "the ways in which Akbar used to do dirty acts is recorded in the pages of history and it was stopped by Kiran Kumari
" vah uskaa yon shoshan karnaa chahta tha
 But Kiran was cautious
 jab akbar ne chhedchhad kii koshish kii to usne akbar kii chaati par kataar se waar kiya
 "saini continued," After this, Akbar begged for life by saying that the king of India is in your footsteps
 us din ke baad se minaa bazaar ko band kar diya gaya
 The Rajasthan BJP president said, comparing such a person with Maharana Pratap is a joke with history and it will not inspire history to come
 gauratlab he ki jab rajasthan main bhaajapa kii sarkaar thi, tab usne akbar ke naam se 'mahaan' hatwa diya tha or yah kaha gaya ki haldighati ke yuddh main maharana pratap ne akbar ko haraa diya tha
 Saini said, "I believe that Maharana Pratap's self-respect will be no less than removed in his fame books
" maharana pratap logon ke dilon main rahete hai or unhen vahaan se hataaya nahin ja saktaa
 They cannot be removed from history
 ve sirf itihaas se unke bare main chaar line hi hataa sakate hai

 PWD Minister Sajjan Singh Verma, who attacked the Congress government, said that it is his (BJP) mentality to do something like a dog when the Kamal Nath government of Madhya Pradesh transferred 46 police dogs and their handlers across the state
 'verma ke kathan ke jawaab main bijepi ke vidhayak rameshwar sharma ne kaha ki yadi sajjan singh verma hamen kutta kah rahe hai to main unase kahana chaahunga ki haa ham kute hai, ham madhyapradesh ke logon ke vafaadaar kute hai, or ham apane logon or suraksha balon ke liye aawaaj uthaate rahenge
 It is worth noting that transfers have been going on since the Lok Sabha elections in Madhya Pradesh
 kamalnath sarkaar ne badi taadaad main sarkari karmchaariyon or adhikariyon ke tabadale kiye hai
 Meanwhile, recently an order has been issued to transfer 46 dogs with their handlers in the 23rd Battalion of Special Armed Forces in Madhya Pradesh
 is aadesh se 46 khoji kutton ke sthaan badal gaye hai
 These include Sniffer, Narco and Trekker Dog
 kamalnath ke grih jile chhindwara se bhi ek snifer dog ko bhopal main siem awaas sthanantarit kar diya gaya he
 After the transfer list of the dogs of the police force, BJP threw mud on the state government
 bijepi ke pradesh upaadhyaksh or bhopal jile ke hujur vidhansabha kshetra ke emele rameshwar sharma ne twit kiya ki 'hai re bedardi congress sarkaar kutton ko to chhod dete 
 
 
 ! The police department made bulk transfers of dogs
 congress kii kamalnath sarkaar kaa vash chale or koi maal dene vaala mil jaae to wo jameen or aasmaan kaa swayan ke vyay par tabadalaa kar den
 'hi Ray, the Congress government would have abandoned the dogs
 
 
 ! police vibhaag ne kiye kutto ke thokband tabadale 
 If the Kamal Nath government of the Congress comes to power, and if someone gives a consignment, he transfers the land and the sky at his own expense

 Three months after the High Court gave a fractured order, Justice VM Sahai said that the "handicap" adopted by Modi on the Lokayukta issue "shows the deterioration in our democracy"
 ’ Justice Sahai was entrusted with the hearing against the appointment of the Lokayukta following a split order of a two-member bench
 nyaayamurti sahay ne kaha ki nyaayamurti mehta kii niyukti par ‘asahyog’ kaa modi kaa ‘aapattijanak’ aacharan kanoon ke shashan liye khatra he
 He said that Modi's attempt to extend the process for appointment of Lokayukta by issuing Gujarat Lokayukta (amendment) Ordinance 2011 is a 'corrupt and furious' action
 yah ullekh karte hue ki ‘asaadhaaran sthitiyaan asaadhaaran samaadhaan kii maang karti hai’ unhone kaha ‘lokayukta kii niyukti ke maamle main gujarat ucch nyaayalay ke mukhya nyaayadhish kii raay ke mahatv ko sweekaar nahin kar mukhyamantri ke netritv main mantriparishad ke khule virodh ne sankatpurna sthiti paidaa kar di he

 apane angadaan se duusare ko jivan dekar kuch insaan bhagwaan ban jate hai
 Organ donation day is being celebrated all over the world on 13 August
 angadaan kaa matlab he kisi shaks se swasth ango or tissues ko lekar inhen kisi duusare jaruratmand shaks main transplant kar diya janaa
 With such a donation, one's life can be saved
 angadaan mrityu ke baad or kabhi-kabhi jivit bhi hota he
 But the lack of awareness and backwardness in our country is clearly visible in the case of organ donation
 jaaniye aapkaa angadaan, dusron kii jindagi ke liye kitna mahatvapurn ho saktaa he or jaane isse jude jaruri tathyon ke bare main1
 1 every year in the country
 5 lakh kidani kii jarurat padati he, jabaki 3 hajaar muhaiyaa ho paati he
 2
 marijon ko 25 hajaar nae liver kii aavashyaktaa hoti he lekin hasil ho pate he sirf 800
 3
 60 lakh netraheenon logon ko ankhon kii jarurat hoti he, lekin 22, 384 logon ko hi hasil ho paati he
 
 
 
 jab 72 saal pehle basaa-basaaya hiroshima hua shamshaan ghat main tabdiangdan do tarah se kiye ja sakate hai- living donor:jivit rahete hue koi bhi vyakti sharir ke kuch ang jaise kidney, bone maro (asthi majja), liver or fefde kaa kuch hissaa parijanon ko donnet kar saktaa he
 - Brain Dead: It is also called cadaver donor
 18 saal se kam umr ke yuva parents kii anumati or isse adhik umr hone par angadaan ke liye registration kara sakate hai
 When the brain is declared dead, the kidneys, liver, lungs, pancreas, ovaries, uterus, eyes, bones, and skin are transplanted to another body
 angadaan ke maamle he desh he kaaphi pichheshingapore, belgium or spane main 10 lakh main se 20 se 40 log, america, germany or netherland main 10 lakh main se 10 se 20 log angadaan karte hai
 Whereas in India, this figure 0 out of every 10 lakhs
 16 logon kaa he
 'quit India': The biggest movement of the country was shaken, English rule is given in India behind the non-donation of organ in India
 Many arguments such as: - If the patient is a donor, then the effort to save his life is minimized
 - hamaara dharm isaki ijaajat nahin detaa
 - The cost of organ extradition, the donor's family has to pay
 - angadaan ke bare main jaagarukta kii kami
 Illegal business in the name of organ donation is flourishing, 10 thousand organs are being bought and sold illegally
 duniya main ang vikray ke avaidh dhandhe kaa 75% hissaa kidney se sambandhit hota he
 Smugglers, while illegally selling kidneys, earn $ 2 lakh
 har ang jaruri heapako bataaden prakritik maut main angadaan sirf kidney or ankhon tak simit nahin he
 Rather, heart valves, skin, bones, veins, and arteries may also be donated
 iske alaava brain deth ke baad liver, fefden, agnyashay, garbhashay, haathon or pairon kii ungliyaan bhi daan dena sambhav he
 
 
 
 ek superhiro jisane banaaya makadi ke jaal ko apni takatnheen he umr kii koi seemaadankarta kii umr se koi fark nahin padataa
 People over 100 years old can also donate their cornea and skin
 - 70 saal se zyaada umr ke log: kidney or liver- 50 saal se zyaada umr ke log: hadhy or fefde- 40 saal se zyaada umr ke log: hriday valvesabakaa vakt nishcibhang pratyrpan ke liye ek samay seemaa tay hoti he, jiskaa dhyaan rakhana behad zaruri he
 - Heart and lungs 6 hours after death - 12 hours after death Liver - 24 hours after death Pancreas - Kidney can be extradited 48 hours after death
 agar aap kisi ko jeevandaan dene ke liye angadaan ke liye taiyaar he to angadaan kii pehali shart jaan len
 Healthy person is most important for organ donation
 saath hi vah echivi, diabetes, cancer, gambhir sankraman, kidney or hriday rogon se peedit na ho

 ) When the Supreme Court lifted the ban on Mumbai's dance bar on 16 July, the scene of that night was like this: 9 o'clock
 topaaj dance baar ke daravaaje khule hai jo kabhi mumbai kii rangeen raaton ke shababi jashn kaa shahenshaah hua karata tha
 The inner hall is lined with frescoes of the Kamasin Hasinas
 sinboard par koi roshni nahin, mahangi kaaron kii kataren bhi nahin jinka swaagat karne ke liye baar ke maalik parvej irani pravesh dwaar par khadey rahete the
 This two-story building of several rooms was once filled with people
 baar main viypi lounj bhi the jinhen investment bankeron se lekar udyogpati or netaa tak alag-alag kism ke log book karte the
 It was also a favorite place for policemen, informers and criminals where there would have been no exchange of information and news between alcohol and beauties
 yahaan ek graahak ek raat main ausatan 10,000 ru
 1 lakh to Rs
 tak kharch karata tha
 Topaz was famous for dancers with similar faces to Bollywood heroines through which the desire of people to meet Bollywood beauties was fulfilled

 Telgi got her dream bar dancer Madhuri here
 kaha jaataa he ki usne maadhuri kii taraashi hui kaaya kii tarif ke alaava kabhi koi or harakat nahin kii
 After the arrest of Telgi in 2004, the attention of the people went to the dance bars and they were considered to be the base of immorality
 inakam tex adhikariyon ne dance baar par chaape maare or baar danceron ko giraftaar kiya
 Fear of getting caught in the customers sat down, so they started hiding
 yah 14 agast, 2005 ko dance baar par lagu kiye gaye pratibandh se pehle kii sthiti thi
 The story after that is completely different
 topaaj ke manager 44 varshiya yogendra shidhare ke anusaar, ek samay tha jab yahaan raat main do shift chalatin thim or uske liye 80 dancer rakhi gai thim
 But now only four women and four men are working who sing with the orchestra
 customer ko sharaab ke paig or khaane ke alaava kisi or cheez ke liye paise dene kii manaahi he
 Three of the bar's security guards had to sell their wives' jewelry long ago so that their children could continue studying in English schools
 dance baar par pratibandh lagane se kai logon ko jabardast nuksaan pahunchaa he
 Business estimates suggest that Mumbai's bar dancers have lost 70 per cent in earnings; 65,000 women and 45,000 men lost their jobs
 haalanki apper-class restraan or shahar kii seemaa se baahar mira-bhayandar, thane-godbandar or panwel hive ke baar main ab bhi dance kaa kaarobaar chal rahaa he
 Nearly half of Mumbai's bar dancers were disappointed and returned to their cities and villages

 According to police records, 249 bars are licensed to perform with the orchestra in Mumbai
 mumbai baar maalikon ke association ke adhyaksh or dadar ke karishma baar ke maalik manjit singh sethi kehete hai ki anumaan he ki pratibandh se pehle inaki sankhya 1,250 thi
 While the state government is setting up a panel of legal experts to review the Supreme Court's decision, bar owners like Sethi are talking about reinstatement of all bar licenses before the ban
 jab tak rajya sarkaar apana rukh spasht nahin karti, tab tak baar maalikon kaa bhavishya spasht nahin ho saktaa
 Most of the owners today do not have the money to restart the application process after an eight-year ban
 anumaan he ki pratibandh kii vajah se exise or sharaab kii bikri se jude kareeb 3,000 karod ru
 The business ended
 vidambnaa yah he ki dance baar par pratibandh lag jane se ve ladkiyaan aaj zyada asurakshit ho gai hai, jabaki baar main kaam karte vakt koi unhen chhu nahin saktaa tha
 At that time there were bouncers to protect him

 He also wants something else
 ’ jab dance hota tha, to ladakiyon ko 'kuch or’ dene kii jarurat nahin hoti thi
 Today, in order to meet the demands of the customer, they have to wear clothes to perform

 The economy that depended on them also collapsed

 Older cinema halls like nearby Apsara, where films like Trishul, Kranti, and Sanyasi have premiered, had reduced ticket prices by half or been converted to multiplexes because of high-income customers stopped coming there

 Is able to earn 2005 main dance baar par jo pratibandh laga, uske peeche kai vajahen hai
 In 2004, the Maharashtra State Commission for Women wrote to the state government about the trafficking of women in dance bars
 2005 main tata institute of soshal sciensej ke project prayaas main bataaya gaya ki mumbai ke dance baar main naaballigon kaa shoshan ho rahaa he
 kahi-suni took place inside the bar and several murders also took place
 maharashtra main dance baar ke liye badnaam panwel or navi mumbai express-ve par hone vaali mauton kii sankhya bad rahi thi
 The night time limit for dance bars was reduced to 9 after a minor rape incident on Marine Drive in 2005
 30 kar di gai
 Still something was smoldering inside, and the fury raging on these things led to a campaign against them, blaming the dance bar for moral decay
 lekin is dauraan mahilaon kii naitikta par to sawaal uthaae gaye, lekin purushon par koi ungali nahin uthaai gai thi
 The lower class bar was opposed to it, but expensive restaurants were ignored
 yah dilachasp he ki thri star hotel se upar ke baar main dance par kabhi pabandi nahin lagaai gai
 People with money are believed to be more moralistic

 She was from an educated family and had the ability to choose another career

 washi main rahane vaali 26 varshiya taruna reddy pehle dance baar main naachati thim or aaj kalyaan ke sheel pata ke ek anya dance baar ke orcestra kaa hissaa hai
 She wants to leave this profession

 She says, "women are no longer safe in dance bars
" yah pehle jaisaa nahin rahaa, na hi pehle jaisaa kabhi ho sakegaa
 " jab apane nae saathi ke saath date par jaaen, to unki baton ko dhyaan se sunen
 With this you can guess whether you should be dating them or not
 pehali date par yaa agali date par is baat par dhyaan den ki vah kin kin vishyon par aapse khul kar baat karte hai
 That's enough to decide how much he is interested in you
 bachapan kii bateshgar vah date par aapke saath apni bachapan kii baaten karne ke liye khaase utsuk hote hai or jab aap sunati hai, to unki ankhen sneh se bhar jaati hai, to mohatarama vah aapse behad pyaar karte hai
 This is proof that he wants to have a very deep relationship with you
 is tarah ke purush khaase bhaavnaatmak bhi hote hai
 Therefore, if you do not have any plan regarding the future, then make it clear to them, so that they do not remain in any misunderstanding
 chand puraani batenapane dating to shuru kar di
 Now also pay attention to how they behave
 kahin aisa to nahin ki vah apni puraani garlfriend ko aaj bhi koste hai
 Suddenly, he pulls her into talk and praises her bad behavior
 agar aisa he, to ek baat to tay he ki vah aaj bhi puraane rishton kii bhaavnaatmak uljhan main fanse hai
 And if he tells you in a very few words what he has learned from his previous relationship, he can be very wealthy and very intelligent and responsible
 isliye in sab baton ko halke main lene ke bajaae unhen samajhen
 Common annoyance: He talks loudly on the phone, it is normal for him to be annoyed
 to yah unke vyaktitv ko darshata he
 If he talks very smoothly on the phone, then he is certainly a rich person, but if he gets annoyed at people by talking, even if he has problems with the common antics of people, then take care

 samaajawaadee party main ghamaasan ke bich party simbel 'cycle' par kabje kii ladaai bhi jari he
 Both Mulayam and Akhilesh faction have submitted their documents before the Election Commission and are about to put their own views before the Commission
 chunaav najadik he or sabaki nigaah is baat par he ki cycle par kiskaa kabja hoga
 Let us know who has an argument in favor of their claim
 mulaayam gut kaa tark-party ke sansthaapak mulaayam singh yadav ne kaha ki ab chunaav chihn koi bhi ho, chunaav vahi pratyaashee ladenge jinke tikat unke dastakhat se jari honge
 Mulayam Singh Yadav claimed that the matter is between his father and son, some people were misled by the son
 unhone ramgopal yadav kaa naam to nahin liya, lekin ishaaron ishaaron main bahut kuch kah diya
 Earlier, Mulayam Singh Yadav had reached the Election Commission along with Amar Singh and Shivpal Yadav
 chunaav ayog main unhone party samvidhan kaa hawala dete hue daawa kiya ki vahi hansmajawaadee partike rashtriya adhyaksh, akhilesh camp ke daavon main koi dam nahin he
 - Mulayam told the Election Commission that according to the constitution of the party, the national president cannot be removed at the national convention
 rashtriya adhiveshan bulaane ke liye kam se kam 30 din pehle notice dena anivaary he, jiskaa paalan nahin kiya gaya
 -mulayam faction said that there is a process to elect a national president, which was not followed
 ramgopal yadav ko pehle se hi unke pad se hataa diya gaya tha
 So they cannot bring any resolution
 unke party se judane kaa elaan sirf twitor ke jariye hi hua tha, jo ki maanya nahin ho saktaa
 Most importantly, no proposal was brought to remove Mulayam Singh Yadav in the session
 lihaaja nayaa rashtriya adhyaksh chunane kaa auchity hi nahin paidaa hota
 The Election Commission should get physical verification of the Akhilesh camp whose support is claiming
 kya daawa he akhilesh gut kaa?-udhar akhilesh yadav ke samarthak ramgopal yadav kii aguwai main chunaav ayog pahunche to chunaav ayog se chunaav kii tareekhen paas aane kii baat rakhte hue is maamle main jald faisla lene kii apil kii
 However, when Ram Gopal Yadav was asked to react to Netaji's statement that he misled Akhilesh, he was enraged
 -chunaav ayog ne akhilesh camp ke logon ko nirdesh die ki party ke vidhayakon kii jo suchi ayog main wo de rahe hai, unki copy duusare paksh yani mulaayam singh yadav ko di jaae
 On behalf of the Akhilesh camp, papers were sent to Netaji at his Delhi and Lucknow offices, but no one anywhere accepted these papers
 -akhilesh gut ne baqayda lakhanu main meeting kii or vidhayakon, emelsi se halafnaamein par dastakhat karaae gaye ki kinake saath hai
 Ramgopal then claimed that 2212 mlas, 68 mlcs and 15 mps were in his court
 ramgopal ne kaha ki jahaan akhilesh hai vahiin asli samaajawaadee party he
 In the midst of a socialist battle for the cycle in the Mulayam Election Commission, raging on Ram Gopal, Mulayam Singh Yadav wrote a letter to the Rajya Sabha Chairman informing him that since Ram Gopal has been expelled from the party, separate arrangements should be made for him to sit in the Rajya Sabha
 loksabhaa spikar om birla ne sadan main hindi bhashaa par kaaphi jor diya he, vah sadasyon se hindi main hi baat karte hai or sadan ke niyamon kaa paalan bhi hindi main hi karte hai
 He has also changed the tradition used during voting on a bill in Parliament
 loksabhaa main ab spikar angreji ke 'aais' or 'nos' kii jagah 'haa' or 'naa' kaa prayog karte hai
 Not only this, he uses the word 'honorable Members' for mps in the House
 loksabhaa kii ye he paramparakaaryawahi ke dauraan jab kisi vishay par sadan main hangaamaa hota he to aksar om birla ko 'asana pairon par he' kehete suna jaataa he
 He has used this word many times
 darasal, asana pairon par he kaa matlab he ki sabhapati asana se khadaa he or sabhi sadsy ab apni seat par baith jaae
 There is a tradition in the House that when a Member of Parliament is speaking out during a discussion and only if the Speaker stands up from his seat, that member has to sit back and stop
 sadan main pad ke protocol ke anusaar sabhapati se bada koi bhi nahin he
 He is considered the Protector of the House and even the Prime Minister addresses him by calling him Chairman or Honorable Chairman
 aise main agar vah apane asana se khadey ho jate hai to unke sammaan main sadasyon ko apni baat rokkar baithna padataa he
 The other aspect of this is that during the proceedings of the House, the said words also come in writing, so it is also difficult to take them on record when two people speak together
 isi vajah se sadan main spikar ek baar main kisi ek hi sadsy ko bolne kii ijaajat detaa he, agar koi bich main bolta bhi he to duusare ko tab tak ke liye chup rahanaa padataa he
 Traditions like the British Parliament, a large part of the Constitution of India is derived from the British Constitution
 vahaan kii sansad main bhi koi saansad tabhi bol saktaa he jab spikar use ijaajat degaa
 Also, there is a tradition in the Parliament of Britain that when the speaker stands up during the speaking of an MP, that MP has to sit on his seat immediately
 koi sadsy apni baat kehane ke liye haath uthaakar spikar kaa dhyaan apni ore khinch saktaa he lekin use baithekar bolne yaa bina spikar kii anumati ke bolne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 Speaker Om Birla has made many changes in the process of running the House after becoming the Speaker
 unhone sadasyon se saaf taur par kah rakhaa he ki kaarywahi ke dauraan sadsy seat par baithkar aapas main baatcheet nahin karenge, agar jaruri ho to sadan se baahar jaakar baat karen or phir sadan main daakhil hon
 Not only this, more opportunities are now being given to new members in the House and lunch time is also extended to raise the subject in zero hour
 aisa karne se zyada sadasyon ko apane mudde uthaane kaa mauka miltaa he
 On Wednesday morning in Phase 3 in Noida, sensation spread after the body of his driver was found inside a taxi
 morning walk ke liye jab log nikle to unki najar ola cab par padi
 When people noticed the driver lying unnoticed on the driver's seat, people first tried to lift it
 jab koi harakat nahin hui to logon ne fouran police ko phone kar diya
 When the police team reached the spot, it was found that the driver had died
 driverke sharir par chot ke kai nishaan bhi maujuud the, isliye police ne laash ko postmortem ke liye bhej diya
 The paper found from the car revealed that the deceased's name is Ajay
 ajay bulandshahr kaa rahane vaala tha or dilli ensiaar ilaake main wo ola cab chalaata tha
 When Ajay's housemates reached Noida from Bulandshahr, they went into shock after seeing the corpse
 gharavaalon kaa kahana he ki ajay kaa sasuraal waalon se sambandh kharaab he or unako shaq he ki ajay ke sasuralwaalon ne hi unakihatyaki he
 Police say that they have taken the complaint of the family members and sent the corpse for postmortem
 police ne shikaayat ke aadhaar par cese to darj kar liya he, lekin uskaa kahana he ki aage kii kaarywai ke liye wo postmortem report milane kaa intjaar kar rahi he
 Police have captured CCTV footage of the surrounding area and are also investigating Ajay's mobile phone

 akhilesh ko raajnneeti kii samaj nahin: jayapradajayaprada ne uttar pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ko bigadaa hua baccha bataaya
 He said that Akhilesh Yadav does not know how to respect elders
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki akhilesh ko raajnneeti kii bilkul bhi samaj nahin he
 According to him, the Samajwadi Party scatter is a model of this senselessness
 unhone udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki dasharath ke kehane par bhagwaan ram 14 varsh ke liye vanvaas chale gaye the
 But Akhilesh did not listen to his father and instead divided the Samajwadi Party

 However, China emphasized the importance of strengthening dialogue between India and Pakistan for the sake of improving mutual trust
 bharat main china ke rajdoot luo jhanohui ne somvaar ko essio ke tatwadhan main bharat, china evampakistanke bich tripaksheeya sahyog ke vichaar kaa samarthan karte hue kaha tha ki isse ‘bhavishya’ main nai dilli or islamabad ke bich dwipaksheeya muddon ko sulajhane or shanti kaayam rakhane main madad milegi
 When asked about Luo's statement, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said that India and Pakistan are friends and neighbors of China
 unhone kaha, ‘ham pakistan or bharat sahit apane sabhi padosiyon ke saath sambandh banaae rakhana chaahate hai taaki is kshetra ke behatar vikaas evam sthirataa ke liye hamaara sahyog majboot ho sake
 "we also hope that India, Pakistan can strengthen their dialogue so that mutual trust in their bilateral relations is improved," Geng said
 ’yah puche jane par ki kya china luo kii tippaniyon se duuri bana rahaa he, is par geng ne kaha, ‘maine jo kuch kaha, vah chini paksh kii aadhikarik sthiti he
 He also did not respond to a question asked by the Chinese embassy about removing the ambassador's comments from transcripts (written material) put on its website
 bharat main chini rajdoot luo ne yah bhi kaha tha ki bharat or china ke bich dwipaksheeya sambandh doklam jaisi ek or ghatana kaa tanaav nahin jhel sakate
 He also stressed the need to find a 'mutually acceptable solution' to the border issue through a meeting of special representatives
 luo ne kaha tha ki ‘kuch bhartiya mitron’ ne essio ke binar tale bharat, china or pakistan ke tripaksheeya sahyog ke suzav die the, jo ‘bahut rachanaatmak vichaar’ he
 This is the second time China has pulled back from supporting Luo
 may 2017 main luo ne nai dilli main hui ek baithak main china-pakistan aarthik galiyare (sipiisi) kaa naam badalane kaa suzav diya tha taaki bharat kii chintaaon par dhyaan diya ja sake
 His remarks were later removed from transcripts posted on the website, perhaps after Pakistan's objection

 abhi tak bina kisi vishesh suvidha vaale mobile phone (feechar phone) par video saamagree nahin dekhi ja sakati thi
 But a new technology called Jigsy has made it possible to watch video content even on ordinary mobile phones
 atyadhik saste mobile phone kaa istemaal karne vaale desh ke karodon graahak bhi ab video saamagree dekhne kaa lutf uthaa paaenge
 The special thing is that people will not have to pay any additional amount for this facility
 phone ko haalanki internet suvidha se yukt hona chahie
 Jigsy is a video streaming technology developed by the new fledgling video streaming company 'jigsy Inc
' in Toronto, Canada
 is praudyogiki se 50 kebipies kii gati vaale internet network par bhi video saamagree kaa pravaah bheja ja saktaa he, jabaki desh main upyog hone vaale adhiktar jeepiares suvidha vaale phone kii internet kii gati 60 kebipies hoti he
 There is a difference between watching videos and downloading videos
 strimming ke tahat video saamagree prasarak ke paas hi rahati he
 You can watch any content just by pressing the button, there is no need to download it on your device, just as there is no need to download the content to watch television
 desh ke 90 fisadi mobile graahakon ke paas feechar phone hai
 This means that the company can get around 500 million subscribers, who are still unable to watch streaming services like youtube on their mobile phones
 jigsi beta naam kaa yah aplicoshan 15 agast se oviai, celmenia (tata docomo, airtel), epia jaise vibhinn storon or company kii apni website achtitipi colon slas em dot jigsi dot com par uplabdh rahegaa
 Initially this application can be downloaded only on mobile phones working on Java, but the company is also trying to convince the mobile phone manufacturers with Android operating system to make their phones compatible with this application
 is aplicoshan kii khaasiyat yah he ki yadi aapke mobile kii internet gati ghatakar 50 kebipies bhi rah jaae, to bhi is par bina kisi rukaawat ke video strimming dekhi ja sakati he
 That is, it will run stream flow, not intermittently
 is aplicoshan main yah suvidha he ki yadi koi video saamagree dekhte vakt mobile kii bydaree khatm ho jaae yaa anya kisi vajah se mobile band ho jaae, to agali baar saamagree vahiin se chal sakati he, jahaan yah band hui thi
 This application can work on all types of internet networks like 2G (GPRS), 3G, wifi
 jigsi ke sansthaapak or mukhya kaaryakari adhikari 35 varshiya re neval ne kaha, jigsi praudyogiki, software yaa mobile aplicoshan hi nahin he, balki isse kuch or adhik he
 Jigsy is one of our ways through which everyone can watch education, entertainment and informative video content without discrimination
 punjab main skool vibhaag kaa silebus badalane kaa mudda abhi thik dhang se thama bhi nahin tha ki vibhaag ne ab kai saare aise faisle le liye hai, jo ki naa to adhyapakon or naa hi vidhyaarthiyon ke gale utar rahe hai
 The surprising thing is that the education minister of the state is not even aware of many decisions taken by the education department
 punjab ke shiksha mantri opi soni ne bataaya ki vibhaag ke sachiv ne do circular nikaale hai
 They have been sent to all government schools in Punjab
 ek circular main punjabi main likhaa hua he ki adhyapakon ke ritairement ke samay hone vaali ferewel party yaa vidaai samaaroh band kiye jaaenge
 Because of this, the students 'time in the teachers' school is wasted
 vahiin duusare circular main likhaa gaya he kii dasvin or 12veen class ke jo student hote hai
 They are given a Farewell party before leaving school in the final year
 yani ki students kii ferewel party par bhi bain lagegaa
 At the same time, the School Education Minister has issued a decree that teachers of government schools of Punjab cannot come to school wearing their own attire
 sarkari adhyapakon ko paint-kameez daalkar hi skool main aana padegaa to vahiin mahila adhyapakon ko bhi plazo, capri, trouger, leging or genes ko naa kehani hogi
 Fellow Education Minister has also said that if teachers come to school and protest in Chandigarh, then action will be taken against them 
 Former Punjab Education Minister Dr
 Daljit Cheema said that the Education Department in Punjab often remains in the headlines
 kabhi kharaab rigelt, kabhi silebus main badlaav to kabhi students or adhyapakon ko shiksha vibhaag dwaara jari kiye gaye aadesh
 Despite all this, the standard of education is not improving
 dow dalajit cheema kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ko bacchon kii shiksha par dhyaan dena chahie
 Not on teachers' dress and Farewell party
 agar koi adhyaaapak 30, 35 saal kii sarvice ke baad ritair hota he
 As a farewell, the school castoffs and children also give a small party for 10:15 minutes of tea and samosas after school time, so what is the harm in this? student or teacher kaa ek rishta hota he
 This relationship is played out only at the time of farewell
 lihaaja sarkaar ke tamaam faisle galat hai
 These verdicts are sobering as well as dictatorship
 punjab sarkaar ke in faislon par skulon main padhaane vaale adhyaaapak or padhane vaale vidhyaarthee donon hi khush najar nahin aae
 They believe that because the Farewell party meets a student after 10 or 12 years of continuous schooling, the teacher gets retirement after studying for 30 to 35 years in a row
 lihaaja student or teacher donon hi sarkaar ke in faislon se khush najar nahin aae

 The statement said that Russia has so far refused to give the expected explanation in the case of poisoning former Russian spy Sergey Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, England

 In the US, the White House said that Russia's decision to expel 60 of its diplomats and order the closure of the US consulate in St
 Petersburg is a sign that bilateral relations are deteriorating further
 white house kii press sachiv sara sanders ne kaha, 'america rajanyikon ko nishkasit karne kii rus kii karrwai is baat kaa sanket detii he ki america-rus sambandh or badtar ho rahe hai
 'significantly, Russia, in retaliation, has asked 60 US diplomats to leave the country within 7 days and to close the St

 On May 16 this year, in front of the Vidhan Bhavan in Lucknow, drums were being played at the state headquarters of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 chaar maheene baad sitambar main taarikh to 16 hi thi, lekin is baar jashn bijepi mukhyalay se do kimi dur samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke pradesh karyaalay main tha
 The workers were celebrating the victory in the by-election
 is baar bijepi un 10 vidhansabha siton main se 7 se haath dho baithi, jo usne varsh 2012 main sapa kii aandhi rokkar jiti thim
 The BJP, which won 73 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in UP with its allies in the Lok Sabha elections, continued to raise the issue of communal riots from every platform
 agast main jaise hi pradesh kii 11 vidhansabha siton or mainpuri loksabhaa seat par upachunaav kii ghoshnaa hui to party sidhe hindutv or dhruvikaran ke agenda par kaam karne lagi
 In the state executive meeting held in Vrindavan on 23-24 August, the party unleashed the melody of 'love Jihad' and within two days, the Firebrand leader Yogi Adityanath was instrumental in the party's campaign campaign committee for the by-election
 Granted
 sampradayik dangon ke aropiyon ko sangrakshan kaa sandesh dene ke liye party ne pehle to thana bhawan se vidhayak suresh rana ko vidhanmandal dal main sachetak kii bhoomika di or baad main saradhana se vidhayak sangeet som ko rajya sarkaar kii sanstuti ke bagaiyr centre se jed plus kii suraksha dilaa di
 It was clear that before the 2017 assembly elections, the BJP wanted to test the strength of the weapon of Hindutva and polarization
 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne 6 sitambar ko ek nijee channel ko die intervyuu main is ore ishaara bhi kiya
 He said, "if communal tension continues in UP, then i tell you that BJP will form the government in UP with absolute majority
" ”ab jab nattejey saamne hai, yogi adityanath haar kii safai dete hue kehete hai, “chunaav jeetne ke liye pratyaashee kaa chayan, sanghathanaatmak sanrachana or vyuh rachana jaruri he
 i was not involved in these processes

 He failed to stop the abuse of power
 ”ulti padi dange par raajnneetimuradabad ke kanth main dalit gaanv ke ek mandir par lage laudspikar utaare jane ko lekar july main sampradayik tanaav hua or bijepi khulkar saamne aa gai
 For a month, BJP leaders kept the issue hot from Moradabad to Lucknow
 lekin muradabad ke thakurdwara vidhansabha upachunaav main party ko munh kii khaani padi
 bjp's efforts to draw Dalit voters towards it on the pretext of this issue could not bring color
 aisa hi prayaas bijepi ne mainpuri loksabhaa seat par bhi kiya
 SP National President Mulayam Singh Yadav vacated this seat and fielded his grandson Tej Pratap Singh Yadav alias Teju
 mainpuri ke bhogaanv vidhansabha kshetra ke alipur kheda kasbe main ek yuvati se rape ke baad hatya ke maamle ne sampradayik tanaav kaa rang le liya tha

 Sikhs and Muslims came face to face in the riots in Saharanpur two months ago

 In the by-elections here, BJP benefited due to low turnout in Muslim dominated areas

 Says Ramesh Dixit, "the BJP forgot to explain the referendum on the Lok Sabha elections
 janata ne modi ke vikaas model ko pasand kiya tha par upachunaav main party dhruvikaran ke aasare thi
 Not repeating the old mistake, the SP was in front of the development issue this time
 ”nahin saadh paaya jaateey samikarnaupachunaav main rashtriya lokdal (ralod) ke chunaav na ladgaye se bhi pashchimi upi main jat matadaataaon ke bijepi main jane kii sambhaavnaaen jataai ja rahi thim, lekin party sthaneey str par santulit sameekaran nahin bitha saki
 Kaushalendra Singh, leader of the RLD from Baghpat, says, “there is a lot of resentment in the Jat community for the manner in which the BJP government has treated the RLD national president Ajit Singh's government office in New Delhi
 ” bispi ke na ladgaye kaa laabh uthaane kii bijepi kii ranneeti bhi kargar sabit nahin hui
 The party had given the responsibility of campaigning in the by-elections to the mps who won all the 17 reserved seats, but none could mobilize the Dalits in favor of the party
 mulaayam kaa kaushalloksabhaa chunaav main buree tarah munh kii khaae mulaayam singh yadav ne upachunaav main 11 main se 8 vidhansabha seat or ek loksabhaa seat jitkar apane rajnatik kaushal se sabhi ko chit kar diya
 It was similar to this, as in the 1993 elections after the demolition of the Babri Masjid, Mulayam had weakened the BJP by weaving the fabric of caste equations
 sapa kaa jamini management bundelkhand kii hamirpur or charkhaari vidhansabha siton par saaf dikhaa
 SP had appointed Mining Minister Gayatri Prasad Prajapati in charge of these two seats
 usne yahaan ke muslim bahul gaanvon main chunaav prachaar abhiyaan kii kaman upi mahila ayog kii adhyaksh jarina osmani or “upi agro and seat ethurity” ke chairman jafar masood kichhauhavi ko saunpi thi
 In the by-elections, the sp's cycle also ran on those seats in Bundelkhand where the party was third in the 2012 assembly elections
 mulaayam kii rajnatik duuradrushti ne hi, baharich kii balha vidhansabha seat par namakan ke chaar din pehle bispi ke nanpaara sanyojak banshidhar buddha ko party kii sadsyta grahan karai or namakan ke thik antim din kii purv sandhya par unhen pratyaashee ghoshit kar diya
 Maya's failed formula: The BSP president, in the by-election held on September 13, had realized that his strategy of transferring the party's vote to independents had failed
 agle hi din mayawati ne loksabhaa chunaav ke baad duusari baar bispi kii jila se lekar booth tak kii cametiyaan bhang karne ke saath jonal koordinetteron main bhi pherbadal kar diya
 Mayawati, who is not known for changing her decisions so soon, has a sudden change in the Lok Sabha elections and by-elections due to the cracking of the core Dalit base associated with the party
 upachunaav main bispi ummidavaar na khadaa karne ke baad mayawati ne party samarthakon ko sandesh diya tha ki ve party samarthit nirdaleey pratyaashee ko vot karen
 In all 11 assembly seats, the bsp-backed independents have fared poorly (see box)
 baharhaal upachunaav ke nattejey sabhi rajnatik dalon ke liye sabak hai
 If the SP looked weak on the urban seats, the bjp's Hindutva card blew
 bispi ke saamne apane kor matadaataaon ko bikharane se rokane kii chunauti he to mritpraaya congress ko sanjivani kii aas he

 'according to a leaked message, US Ambassador to India Timothy Roemer said that if the Indian Army implements the principle of' cold start 'under the present circumstances, it will achieve' mixed results' which is not common opinion in the country and which Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has not fully adopted
 romar ke hastakshar vaale 16 farvari ko likhe gaye ek sandesh main kaha gaya ‘bhartiya sena kaa ‘cold start’ siddhant myth or vaastaviktaa kaa mishran he or ho saktaa he ki yah aavashyak tathaa gambhir sansaadhan baadhaon ke chalate yuddh ke maidan main kabhi istemaal na ho lekin yah ek viksati samrik hamalaa yojana he jisaki ghoshnaa 2004 main kii gai thi or jise sankat ke dauraan 72 ghante ke bheetar karyanvit kiya ja saktaa he

 The message said, 'cold Start was announced by the bjp-led government in 2004 but the Manmohan government did not publicly accept it and due to the Indian government's uncertainty over the use of nuclear weapons by Pakistan, any government could Do not implement it in future

 Notification for two Rajya Sabha seats will be issued on 5 September
 The last date for nomination for both seats will be 12 September
 The seat was vacated by the resignation of Surendra Singh Nagar and Sanjay Seth
 After the resignation of Surendra Singh Nagar and Sanjay Seth from the post of Socialist Party and Rajya Sabha member The dates for the by-elections on vacant seats have been announced

 While the vote and votes will be counted on September 23 for the Rajya Sabha by-election 
 uttar pradesh main bijepi ke paas prachand bahumat he
 In such a situation, bjp's victory in both the Rajya Sabha seats is being decided
 rajyasabha sadsy ke pad or sapa se istipha dekar surendra singh nagar or sanjay seth ne bijepi kaa daaman thama liya tha
 While the tenure of these two Rajya Sabha members was till 2022
 isi ke chalate ab rikt hui donon siton par upachunaav ho rahe hai
 Before these two leaders, Neeraj Shekhar, son of former Prime Minister Chandrasekhar, resigned from Rajya Sabha and Samajwadi Party and joined BJP
 isi ke chalate bijepi ne unhen tikat dekar rajyasabha bheja he
 Neeraj Shekhar has been elected unopposed Rajya Sabha member this month
 rajyasabha kii do siton par ho rahe upachunaav ke liye bijepi ke tikat par logon kii najar he
 In such a situation, it has to be seen whether like Neeraj Shekhar, send Surendra Singh Nagar and Sanjay Seth again as BJP candidates or send someone else as their candidate
 uttar pradesh main bijepi 2017 main record siton ke saath jitkar satta main ai thi
 In such a situation, whoever makes the BJP its Rajya Sabha candidate, it is considered to be elected unopposed
 sutron kii maane to niraj shekhar kii tarj par hi bijepi surendra singh nagar or sanjay seth ko hi apana pratyaashee bana sakati he
 In this way, it is believed that both the leaders will once again reach the high court
 agar aapako yah lagata he ki safalataa raaton-raat milti he to aapaki yah soch galat he
 Because it takes not a day or two, but years of hard work
 or ek safal vyakti ke peeche sirf uski mehnat nahin hoti, balki kai logon kii hoti he
 The role of a father is most important in this
 15 saal kii umr, lekin jeet chukaa he 15 awordaaise hi banaras ke rahane vaale ek pita hai, jinhone apane bete ko padhaane or banane ke liye apana jivan qurbaan kar diya
 Narayan Jaiswal, a resident of Banaras, is a rickshaw driver and while driving a rickshaw and maintaining his family hard, he made his son Govind an IAS
 ek karod paudhe lagane vaale ko log kehete the 'pagal', mila padmashrinarayan jaiswal kii paristhitiyaan aisi nahin thim ki wo apane bete ko bijness kara saken or naa hi koi mahangi padhai kaa boj hi uthaa sakate the
 Due to the fixation of most government jobs, preparation of government job was also meaningless
 isliye govind ke paas UPSC kii taiyaari ke alaava koi doosraa rasta nahin tha
 However, for the preparation of UPSC CIVIL exam, Govind used to meet the expenses of teaching tuition by teaching Govind
 haath nahin, pairon se painting banaakar banaai pahachaanalekin ye jaanakar ki ek rickshaw vaale kaa betaa upiessi kii taiyaari kar rahaa he log badi hansi udaate the
 Father Narayan felt bad about it, but he would not say anything
 wo sirf sahi samay kaa intjaar kar rahe the or ab wo samay aa gaya
 The hard work of Narayan Jaiswal and his son Govind paid off

 vaise ye ek alag baat ho chuki he ki safal vaivaahik jivan ke liye shaadi chaahe lav marriage ho yaa phir arrange, iskaa zyada prabhaav nahin rahata, naa hi shaadi kii pramanikta ko love yaa arrange ke madhyam se janaa ja saktaa he
 Both are on equal footing
 lekin phir bhi aaj har insaan chahta he ki wo kisi ko apana jivan saathi banane se pehle use achche se jaan-pahchaan le, aakhirkaar sawaal puri zindagi saath rahane kaa jo hota he
 Surefire Measures of Love Marriage Our Indian society cannot accept love marriage with such freedom
 baat karen padhein-likhe va vaqt ke saath badalati soch vaale logon kii to aise logon ke liy prem vivaah ab mudda nahin rahaa
 But even today, in many middle class families, parents themselves see their life-partner for their daughter-son
 shaadi banane ke liye janm-kundali ityadi sab dekha jaataa he
 But in spite of all this, somewhere, thousands of questions revolve in the mind of the boy and the girl
 aise me bahut se wo bhi hote he jo apni prem vivaah kii safalataa ke liye duaen kar rahe hote hai
 So if you are also among those who think that what is the solution that your love marriage will be successful
 to chaliye is mudde par ham aapako kuch upaay bataate he jinhen karne se aapako isamen safalataa milegi
 You should chant the mantra "om Lakshmi Narayana Namah" while keeping the right thoughts in mind about your lover
 jaap shuru karne se pehle bhagwaan vishnu or maan lakshmi kii murti yaa phir unki photo apane saamne rakhle or jaap ke liye sphatik maala kaa prayog karen
 Also keep in mind, start chanting this mantra on the Thursday of Shukla Paksha
 aisa karne se aap us insaan ko apni ore aakarshith kar paaenge jinke saath prem vivaah karnaa chaahate he
 There is also a second mantra, before beginning the chanting, keep in mind your lover or girlfriend, worshiping Lord Krishna and start chanting this mantra
 joki he: “”keshavi keshavaradhya kishori keshavastuta, rudra roopa rudra murti: rudrani rudra devtaa
 "" Doing so helps in love marriage
 har shuukravaar ke din aap radha-krishna kii pratimaa ke saamne baithkar upar bataae mantra kaa 108 baar jaap karen
 After doing this for three months, you will start to see its effects and all the troubles which come in love marriage will start to be removed
 ham sabhi ne ye avashya hi dekha he ki jo log prem vivaah kii manokamana rakhte he, har yatha sambhav koshish karte hai ki unke parivaar vaale maan jaye yaa phir kundali me bane kharaab yoga ko kis prakaar thik kiya ja sake
 Above, we have also told you some mantras, with the help of which love is successful in marriage
 in sabake alaava bhi aksar premi-premicaon ko kai baar hastrekha vidya kaa sahaara lete dekha gaya he
 Let us tell you that although many lines appear on the palm of a human being, but the line of marriage is in the transverse position at the bottom of the smallest finger, which you call a little figure
 choti ungali ke neeche vaale bhaag ko budh parvat kehete he
 By the way, there can be more than one marriage line in your palm and if the marriage line is visible with clear and red lines, then that person's marital life is very happy
 aap haath kii rekhaon kaa gyaan rakhane vaale kisi export se milakar is mudde ko or achche se samaj sakate he
 Apart from this, how with the help of birth chart do you know if love is the sum of marriage or not
 to bataa den ki aapaki kundali kaa pancham evam saptam bhav prem vivaah main mahatvapurn sthaan rakhte hai
 The combination of Panchamesh and Saptamesh in the fifth or seventh house or changing the zodiac sign of both shows the possibility of love marriage
 isi tarah, lagnesh evam sapthamesh kaa sthaan badalanaa bhi prem vivaah kaa kaaran hota he
 If your horoscope shows that there is a moon and moon in your ascendant - then this will be your love marriage
 agar saptam main sapthamesh va chandramaa hota he to bhi prem vivaah ho saktaa he
 You can also take some other measures for the success of your love marriage, such as not forgetting to worship Venus Dev, as well as wearing Panchamesh and Saptamesh, you should wear a Panchamesh Ratna
 agar kahin aap bhi apane prem-vivaah kii safalataa ko lekar asamanjas me fanse hai, to yakeenan upar bataae gaye upaae va mantron kii madad se aapako samaadhaan milegaa or aap apane premi ke saath ek sunahari zindagi jeene ke sapane ko saakaar kar sakenge
 Yes, it is such a life that lovers and girlfriends live every day
 to ummid karte he, prem-vivaah ke maarg main aane vaale baadhaon ko dur kar aap premi ke saath ek khushiyon bharaa jivan ji saken
