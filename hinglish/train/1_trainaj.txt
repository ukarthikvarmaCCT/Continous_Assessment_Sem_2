 This is the most appropriate time to research how we Indians keep notes in our homes
 gharon main paise bachaane ke tamaam thikaane kii dilachasp kissa saamne aayega
 This skill of saving money in homes is hundreds of years old
 thik he ki bank, credit card, debit card, mobile baking hamaare samay ke nae tareeke hai lekin hamaare isi samay main apane anti main note dabaakar rakhane kii pratha badastoor chal rahi he
 This secret wealth is the last breath of families
 aap bhi phone kar apni nani daadi se pataa kiijie ki wo kyon is tarah se paise bachaakar rakhti hai
 By saving means hiding
 agar hindustan kii karodon auraton ke bachaae in paison ko iskar vibhaag ke niras or daraavne kanoon kii nazar se dekhenge to apane samaaj ko samajhane main galati kar sakate hai
 Except in some cases, this money of women is not about black money or theft
 yah paisa auraton kii dashakon kii aarthik samaj, aarthik sabar kaa fal he
 It is less, but please do not call it stolen money
 hamen aam auraton ke bachaaye paise ko, kaala dhan stock rakhane waalon ke saath mix nahin karnaa chahie
 Women do not save this money for themselves nor spend it on themselves
 apni tamaam ichchhaaon ko maar kar bachat kii nirantar sadhana main lagi rahati hai
 This money is the strength of women's economic freedom
 isaki khubi yah hoti he ki yah kisi kii nazar main nahin hota magar sabko jodta chalata he
 Through these funds, married women keep on watering their maiden relationship
 kabhi bhai ko kuch de diya kabhi maai ko kuch de diya
 When you keep this money in the bank, then it may be a little far from your maternal home
 bank main rakhe paise ko pati or bacchon se chhipaana mushkil he
 The problem is not that the government will know, the problem is that the society will know
 indian express main hi ek kissa chapa he ki chaay vaale kii patni ne paanch sau ke do note razaai kii paraton main chipa kar rakhe the
 It may be the support of his old age
 aasraa ho ki kuch hoga to yah paisa kaam aa saktaa he
 This money of women is less in quantity but gives more support than the money kept in the bank
 jab yah paisa bainkon main jayega to arthvyavastha ko nayaa sahaara to milegaa lekin aurat virdohi is samaaj main anchal ke kone main chhipi unki azaadi kaa chota sa zariyaa bhi letaa jayega
 From this point of view, you will be able to understand the psychology of the two lakh or five hundred thousand notes deposited with women
 sadiyon purana ek system ja rahaa he uske bare main baat to kar hi sakate hai
 How will this small money reach the bank affect the social status of women, in my view, it is such a big issue that researchers of all universities should leave all work and take up this matter
 kyon amir se lekar garib auraton ne bachat ke is gupt tareeke ko apanaaya he
 Why many women are terrorized by this decision
 stri dhan unki aarthik swatantraaa kii choti si khidki he jise wo apni marzi se kholti hai, apni marji se band kar detii hai
 Can the bank and the government provide this protection? gupt dhan un auraton ke paas bhi hota he jinke paas bank ke khate hote hai
 It happens if it happens jaise bacchon kaa gullak hota he
 Is already from the bank and will remain even when the bank sinks
 stri dhan nahin duubataa, wal street par bade bade bank kangaal ho jate hai
 With the help of many colleagues, we found out what is called such money in their homes which women keep the most
 hamaare gaanv kii taraf to auraten is gupt dhan ko kosila kahati hai
 In Bhojpuri it is said that there must be a lot of dust in Kosila
 matlab gupt paisa hoga hi unke paas
 Somewhere it is also called Choruka, Chorudha or Chorita Paisa
 begusarai main ganth bolte hai
 It is called Nehali in Bihar's Magadh province i
e
 Gaya, Nawada, Jehanabad and Aurangabad
 log apni maa se poochhate hai ki maa nehaali main kitna rakhi ho
 Nehali is also called a quilt
 samastipur main ise khoont kaa paisa kehete hai
 The secret wealth of women in Vaishali is called Achra and the torn of men
 upi ke siddharthanagar main kahin acharaa bolte hai to kahin phuphi
 Somewhere in Bahraich and Gorakhpur, it is called Kolaud money
 potli kaa bhi paisa kehete hai
 Lukai double in Kumaon, Uttarakhand
 dabl matlab paisa
 In Haryana, it is said that such money will work in adam adas
 matlab musiibat main kaam aayega
 In Haryana it is called Dharoda and Gupti
 bundelkhand main kuthia kaa dhan kehete hai
 In Azamgarh it is called Kolwari
 karodon pariwaron main auraten is faisle se apane angan main sandigdh ho gayi hai
 Everyone is watching with surprise that there is so much money
 wo raat raat jaag rahi hai ki kaise pati ko bataayen
 Tell father in law or tell father
 ve apane hi ghar main nihattha ho gayi hai
 She is trembling with the fear that everyone will know at home
 ho saktaa he ki ve sarkaar ke faisle ke saath hai lekin unke man ke kisi kone main sadiyon se chali aa rahi azaadi kii yah nemat kho jane kaa dar bhi baitha hua he
 i myself am involved in the celebration of this decision but there is nothing wrong in understanding this fear of women
 vaise bhi ab to jo ja rahaa he, use roka nahin ja saktaa lekin jo ja rahaa he use dekha to ja saktaa he ki jate jate kaise sata rahaa he
 a colleague of ours recorded a video of a houseworker in which he said that he had deposited five thousand rupees from a five hundred rupee note to the granddaughter's wedding
 jab hamaare sahyogi ne kaha ki ise tivi par dikhaa sakate hai to usne haath jod liya ki pati ko pataa chal jayega
 Not only husband, she also saves money from children
 ho saktaa he ki bainkon se judane se wo sambal ke nae tareeke kii aadi ho jaaen lekin itani puraani parampara ja rahi he, kuch to ghabrahat hogi hi
 Why the grandmother insisted on keeping her granddaughter's marriage money secret, the Income Tax Officer can never understand it, nor is it a matter of any finance minister
 isliye doordaraj ke gaanvon or kasbon kii auraton se baat kiijie ki yah sabake hit main he
 There is nothing to fear
 stri dhan kehalaata bhale dhan he magar hota bahut kam he
 This is the last and secret fort of social security in families
 sarkaar ne bhi kaha he ki dhai lakh tak kii raashi auraten aaraam se bank laa sakati hai
 Can be deposited in the account
 unase koi poochtacha nahin hogi
 The question is not of inquiry
 sawaal he pataa chal jane kaa
 What will be the status of the money that our women have not allowed to know for centuries, when the secret will open in their homes
 kya pataa choti si azaadi jane ke badale koi badi azaadi unka intazaar kar rahi ho
 In celebration of black money, i kept turning to the newspapers, watching video footage of colleagues that in a picture we would see those people whom we imagine have money in their sacks
 wo dahaad markar ro rahe honge
 If the line of the banks started, i went to see myself, but the people who were in the line did not feel that they had sack notes in their houses
 kya aise logon ne apane paison ko thikaane laga diya he yaa itminan hai ki jugad kar lenge
 Money will be left in the right bag in the sack
 kuch ne kaha ki ye upar upar hans to rahe hai magar andar andar ro rahe hai
 If any of such people intend to cry outside, then you can contact me
 media inke sannaate ko darj nahin kar paa rahaa he
 If people holding 500, 1000 notes in sacks and beds are very angry then please come on TV and say your mind
 kahen ki maar padi he or kishor kumaar kaa wo gaanaa gaayen ki pataa he tumhen kya, kahaan dard he, yahaan haath rakhana, yahaan dard he
 The trap of sorrow has become good
 patrkaar ne aakar meraa haal to poocha
 At present, what is seen on the streets does not seem to be sacks
 kahin ye log sone chaandi kii dukaanon kii taraf to nahin chale gaye
 If you too leave your little troubles and tell such people, then definitely tell us
 ham bekaar main bank bank kiye ja rahe hai wo apane kamare main hanse hansate lot pot ho rahe honge
 It should not happen
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha he ki 500, 1000 ke noton par lage is bain se agar chunaav ke karch kam hote hai to acchhee baat he
 i am crying for joy in imagining this simplicity of politics
 punjab or upi chunaavon ko paise kii nigaah se dekhiyegaa
 If black money is eliminated, it will be the simplest and ideal election in Indian history
 aapke paise kaa hisaab poocha ja rahaa he ki kahaan se aayaa, lekin aapako pataa to hoga ki raajnneetik dal aapako nahin bataate hai ki unhen kahaan se paisa aayaa
 They tell the Election Commission but not you
 soochna kaa adhikaar unke yahaan lagu nahin he
 There is no PAN card or Aadhar card system
 magar aapke chaar hazaar ke badale pan number maanga ja rahaa he
 Aadhaar card is being sought
 ek anumaan ke mutabik agar kisi dal ko 500 karod rupee chande ke milte hai to uskaa 80 fisadi 20 hazaar se kam kaa hota he jiske daataaon ke naam nahin bataane ke liye unhen chhot mili he
 Why should they get this exemption
 ye sawaal apane netaaon se puuchhiyegaa
 i am sure big leaders will become fans of such questions
 par maan lete hai ki raajnneeti se kaala dhan chalaa gaya to imidiat impact kya hoga
 What will be the immediate effect in Hindi? maan lijie ki raajnneeti se bhi kaala dhan chalaa gaya to kya hoga
 Rallies are happening in UP with so many buses, all of them should stop
 mujhe to lagata he ki upi main bijepi, basapa, congress or sapa ke chaaron netaa ek hi car main raily karne jaaenge
 Will tour UP by car pool
 raajnneeti main car-pool kii pratha chal padegi
 The convoy of cars will end
 aapke bagal se chaar chaar bade netaa guzar jaaenge pataa bhi nahin chalegaa
 Along with the car pool, a new practice of rally pool may also be launched
 yani ek jagah janata jutegi or ek hi manch par chaaron dalon ke bade netaa bhaashan denge
 After listening to everyone, the public will vote
 ham channel vaale bhi ek saath inhen live dikhaa denge
 Posters will also become cheaper
 ek hi poster main chaaron netaa kii tasviir hongi or haath jode vot maangate nazar aaenge
 The copy of the manifest will also print the same
 ek chapter bijepi kaa, ek chapter congress kaa or ek chapter basapa ou ek chapter sapa kaa hoga
 The comments helicopter waalon kii dukaan band ho jaaegi
 At the time of election, the helicopter will rotate the public for free
 ek hi car main chaar chaar netaa jab neeche se upar kii taraf dekhenge to purv kaala dhan kaal ko yaad karte hue aahen bharenge
 The post Black Money Era will be considered a period of simplicity
 guuruuvaar ko bainkon ne logon ko paise dene shuru kar diye
 People kept in line for hours, i also met many such people
 ek baat nazar ai
 These people are upset but are not angry with the government's decision
 kahin se bhi bainkon ke baahar hangaame yaa marpet kii khabare nahin ai tab bhi jab kai jagahon par counter samay se pehle band ho gaye
 Only got two thousand instead of four thousand
 log dhiraj ke saath line main hai
 They are telling their problems but they are not saying that the government has done wrong
 ames main opidi main agar clinical charge 500 se kam hoga to do dinon ke liye bill maaf kar diya gaya he
 Five hundred notes are being taken at the drug stores
 kai log kah rahe hai ki dukandaar 500 lekar chuttay nahin de rahaa he
 Now understand this matter like this
 bazaar main jitani karency he uskaa 86 fisadi paanch sau or hazaar ke note kaa he
 So obviously the remaining fourteen percent will have ten, twenty, fifty and hundred notes
 14 fisadi note se 86 fisadi kii bharpai nahin ho sakati he
 So the shopkeepers are not bullying you
 unke paas chuttay kii vaaki kami hogi isliye nahin de rahe hai
 In this report, we have recorded the sufferings of the people
 auraten ye paisa apane liye nahin bachaati hai na hi apane upar kharch karti hai
 By killing all her desires, she is engaged in continuous cultivation of savings
 yah paisa auraton kii aarthik swatantraaa kaa sambal hota he
 Its quality is that it is not in anyone's eyes but it keeps everyone connected
 in paison ke zariye vivaahit auraten apane maayke ke rishte ko sinchati rahati hai
 Sometimes he gave something to his brother, sometimes he gave something to Mai
 is paise ko jab aap bank main rakh denge to ho saktaa he wo apane maayke se thodi dur ho jaaen
 It is difficult to hide the money kept in the bank from husband and children
 pareshaani is baat kii nahin he ki sarkaar jaan jaaegi, pareshaani is baat se he ki samaaj jaan jayega
 There is an anecdote in the Indian Express itself that two hundred five hundred notes were hidden by the wife of the tea person in the layers of the quilt
 ho saktaa he yah uske budhaape kaa sahaara ho
 Hope that this money can be useful if something happens
 auraton kaa yah paisa maatra main kam hota he magar bank main rakhe paise se zyaada sahaara detaa he
 When this money goes to the banks, the economy will get new support, but in this anti-women society, it will also take a small means of their freedom hidden in the corner of the region
 is nazar se dekhenge to auraton ke paas jamaa lakh do lakh yaa paanch sau hazaar ke note kaa manovigyaan samaj paaenge
 You can talk about a system that is going on centuries old
 is chote se paise ke bank main pahunchane se auraton kii saamaajik sthiti par kya asar padegaa, meri nazar main yah itnaa bada masalaa he ki tamaam vishvavidhyalayon ke researchron ko sara kaam chhod kar is par lag janaa chahie
 Why women from rich to poor have adopted this secret method of saving
 kyon kai auraten is faisle se aatankit hai
 Female wealth is a small window of her financial freedom, which she opens at her own will and closes on her own free will
 kya ye suraksha bank or sarkaar de sakati he
 Secret money is also with women who have bank accounts
 yah hota he to hota he
 Like children have a piggy bank
 bank se pehle se he or jab bank dub jaayenge tab bhi rahegaa
 Female wealth does not sink, big banks bankrupt on Wall Street
 hamane kai sahyongiyon kii madad se pataa kiya ki unke gharon main aise paise ko kya kehete hai jise auraton sabase bachaakar rakhti hai
 On our village side, women call this secret money Kosila
 bhojpuri main aise kahati hai ki zarur kosila main dhaile hoinhen
 That means they will have secret money
 kahin kahin choruka, chorudha yaa chorita paisa bhi kaha jaataa he
 Lumps are spoken in Begusarai
 bihar ke magadh praant yani gaya, navada, jahanabad or aurangabad main ise nehaali kehete hai
 People ask their mother how much their mother has kept in Nehali
 nehaali razaai ko bhi kehete hai
 In Samastipur it is called peg money
 vaishali main auraton kaa gupt dhan acharaa kehalaata he or mardon kaa phada
 Somewhere in Siddharthanagar in UP, Achara speaks and Phunfi somewhere
 bahraaich or gorakhpur main kahin kahin koludh kaa paisa kehete hai
 The bundle is also called money
 uttarakhand ke kumaun main lukai dabl kehete hai
 Double means money
 haryana main aise paise ko kehete hai ki adi adaas main kaam aayega
 Meaning trouble will come
 haryana main dharod or gupti kehete hai
 In Bundelkhand, it is called the wealth of the Kuthia
 azamgarh main kolvari kehete hai
 Women in crores of families have become suspicious in this courtyard by this decision
 sab hairaani se dekh rahe hai ki itnaa paisa he
 She is awake night and night to tell her husband
 sasur ko bataaye yaa pita ko bataaen
 She is unarmed in her own home
 wo is bhay se kaanp rahi hai ki ghar main sabko pataa chal jayega
 Maybe they are with the decision of the government, but there is also a fear of losing this policy of freedom that has been going on for centuries
 main khud is faisle ke jashn main shaamil hum lekin auraton ke is bhay ko samajhane main koi buraai nahin he
 Anyway, what is going on now cannot be stopped, but what is going on can be seen how it is torturing people as they go
 hamaare ek sahyogi ne ghar par kaam karne vaali kaa ek video record kiya jisamen unhone kaha ki paanch paanch sau rupee ke note se unhone paanch hazaar rupee jamaa kiye hai potee kii shaadi ke
 When our colleague said that it could be shown on TV, he folded his hands that the husband would know
 pati hi nahin bacchon se bhi paisa bachaa kar rakhti hai
 It may be that they are accustomed to the new way of sambal by joining banks, but such an old tradition is going, there will be some panic
 potee kii shaadi kaa paisa gupt rakhane kii zid us daadi ne kyon paali thi ise iskar adhikari kabhi nahin samaj saktaa he na hi kisi vitt mantri ke bas kii baat he
 So talk to women in remote villages and towns that it is in everyone's interest
 darane kii baat nahin he
 a woman is called wealth, but there is very little
 pariwaron main saamaajik suraksha kaa yah aakiri or gupt kila hota he
 The government has also said that up to two and a half million women can comfortably bring banks
 khate main jamaa kara sakati hai
 There will be no inquiry from them
 sawaal poochtacha kaa nahin he
 The question is to know
 jin paison ko sadiyon se hamaari auraton ne pataa nahin chalane diya wo raaj jab gharon main khulegaa to unki sthiti kya hogi
 Do you know that instead of going for small freedom, some big freedom is waiting for them
 kaala dhan jane ke jashn main main akhabaaron ko palatataa rahaa, sahyogiyon ke video footage dekhtaa rahaa ki kisi tasviir main wo log to dikhenge jinaki ham kalpana karte hai ki unke yahaan boriyon main paisa bharaa hota he
 They must be crying in roar
 bainkon kii line lagi to khud gaya dekhne magar vahaan jo log line main the aisi haalat ke nahin lage ki inke gharon main bori kii bori note rakhe the
 Have such people put their money where they are or are leisurely enough to make a jugaad
 bori main na sahi bag main paisa batch hi jayega
 Some said that they are laughing upwards but crying inside
 agar aise logon main se kisi ko baahar baahar rone kaa iraadaa ho to mujhase sampark kar sakate hai
 The media is unable to record their silence
 agar 500, 1000 ke noton ko boriyon or bistaron main dabaakar rakhane vaale log bahut gusse main hai to pleez tivi par aakar apane man kii baat kahen
 Say that she is beaten up and sing that song of Kishore Kumar that you know what, where is the pain, here is the hand, here is the pain
 gam kaa fasaana ban gaya acha
 The journalist came and asked about my condition
 philhal sadakon par jo dikh rahe hai wo lagate nahin hai ki boriyon vaale hai
 Somewhere these people went towards gold and silver shops
 aap bhi apni choti moti pareshaani chhod aise log rote milen to hamen zarur bataayen
 We are being banked banklessly, they must be laughing and laughing in their rooms
 aisa nahin hona chahie
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that if the ban on 500, 1000 currency notes reduces election expenses then it is a good thing
 main to raajnneeti kii is saadagi kii kalpana main maare khushi ke roe ja rahaa hum
 Punjab and UP will look at elections with money
 agar kaala dhan samaapt ho gaya he to bhartiya itihaas kaa sabase sada or adarsh chunaav hoga
 Your money is being asked where it came from, but you will know that political parties do not tell you where they came from
 ve chunaav ayog ko bataate hai lekin aapako nahin
 Their right to information is not applicable here
 koi pan card yaa aadhaar card kaa system nahin he
 But instead of your four thousand PAN number is being sought
 aadhaar card maanga ja rahaa he
 According to an estimate, if a party receives Rs 500 crore in donations, then 80 per cent of it is less than 20 thousand, whose donors are exempted for not disclosing their names
 ye chhot unhen kyon milani chahie
 Will ask these questions to its leaders
 mujhe yakeen he bade bade netaa is tarah ke sawaal karne waalon ke zabariyaa fain ban jaaenge
 But if black money is lost from politics, what will be the immediate impact
 hindi main taatkaalik asar kya hoga
 Suppose what would happen if black money went away from politics as well
 itani basen lekar upi main reliyaan ho rahi hai wo sab ruk jaani chahie
 i think all the four leaders of BJP, BSP, Congress and SP will go to rally in the same car in UP
 car pool karke upi kaa daura karenge
 The practice of car-pools will follow in politics
 kaaron kaa kafila samaapt ho jayega
 Four big leaders will pass by you, you will not even know
 car-pool ke saath saath raily pool kii bhi nai pratha launch ho sakati he
 That is, the public will gather at one place and the big leaders of the four parties will give speeches on the same platform
 phir sabko sunakar janata apana mat de degi
 We will also show these channels together live
 poster bhi saste ho jaaenge
 In the same poster, there will be a picture of the four leaders and hands will be seen asking for votes
 menifeston kii copy bhi ek hi chhapegi
 One chapter will be of BJP, one will be of Congress and one will be of BSP and one will be of SP
 tippaniyan The chopper shop will be closed
 chunaav ke samay apni marcentig karne ke liye helicopter vaale janata ko free main ghumaayenge
 When four leaders in the same car look from the bottom to the top, they will sigh, remembering the former black money period
 post blike mani era saadagi kaa kaal mana jayega
 On Thursday, banks started giving money to people
 log ghanton line main lage rahe, maine bhi aise kai logon se mulaakaat kii
 One thing appeared
 ye log pareshaan to hai magar sarkaar ke faisle se naaraaz nahin he
 There was no news of commotion or assault outside the banks from anywhere, even when counters in many places were closed prematurely
 chaar hazaar kii jagah do hazaar hi mila
 People are in line with endurance
 apni pareshaani zarur bataa rahe hai lekin yah nahin kah rahe hai ki sarkaar ne galat kar diya
 If the clinical charge in the OPD at AIIMS will be less than 500, then the bill is waived for two days
 dawa kii dukaanon par paanch sau ke note liye ja rahe hai
 Many people are saying that the shopkeeper is not holidaying with 500
 ab is baat ko aise samajhiye
 86 percent of the currency in the market is of five hundred and thousand notes
 to zaahir he baaki chaudaa fisadi main hi das bees pachaas or sau ke note honge
 a 14 per cent note cannot compensate for 86 per cent
 isliye dukandaar aapke saath badmaashi nahin kar rahe hai
 They will be really lacking on vacation, so they are not giving
 is report main hamane logon kii takalifon ko darj kiya he
 From this point of view, you will be able to understand the psychology of the two lakh or five hundred thousand notes deposited with women
 sadiyon purana ek system ja rahaa he uske bare main baat to kar hi sakate hai
 How will this small money reach the bank affect the social status of women, in my view, it is such a big issue that researchers of all universities should leave all work and take up this matter
 kyon amir se lekar garib auraton ne bachat ke is gupt tareeke ko apanaaya he
 Why many women are terrorized by this decision
 stri dhan unki aarthik swatantraaa kii choti si khidki he jise wo apni marzi se kholti hai, apni marji se band kar detii hai
 Can the bank and the government provide this protection? gupt dhan un auraton ke paas bhi hota he jinke paas bank ke khate hote hai
 It happens if it happens jaise bacchon kaa gullak hota he
 Is already from the bank and will remain even when the bank sinks
 stri dhan nahin duubataa, wal street par bade bade bank kangaal ho jate hai
 With the help of many colleagues, we found out what is called such money in their homes which women keep the most
 hamaare gaanv kii taraf to auraten is gupt dhan ko kosila kahati hai
 In Bhojpuri it is said that there must be a lot of dust in Kosila
 matlab gupt paisa hoga hi unke paas
 Somewhere it is also called Choruka, Chorudha or Chorita Paisa
 begusarai main ganth bolte hai
 It is called Nehali in Bihar's Magadh province i
e
 Gaya, Nawada, Jehanabad and Aurangabad
 log apni maa se poochhate hai ki maa nehaali main kitna rakhi ho
 Nehali is also called a quilt
 samastipur main ise khoont kaa paisa kehete hai
 The secret wealth of women in Vaishali is called Achra and the torn of men
 upi ke siddharthanagar main kahin acharaa bolte hai to kahin phuphi
 Somewhere in Bahraich and Gorakhpur, it is called Kolaud money
 potli kaa bhi paisa kehete hai
 Lukai double in Kumaon, Uttarakhand
 dabl matlab paisa
 In Haryana, it is said that such money will work in adam adas
 matlab musiibat main kaam aayega
 In Haryana it is called Dharoda and Gupti
 bundelkhand main kuthia kaa dhan kehete hai
 In Azamgarh it is called Kolwari
 karodon pariwaron main auraten is faisle se apane angan main sandigdh ho gayi hai
 Everyone is watching with surprise that there is so much money
 wo raat raat jaag rahi hai ki kaise pati ko bataayen
 Tell father in law or tell father
 ve apane hi ghar main nihattha ho gayi hai
 She is trembling with the fear that everyone will know at home
 ho saktaa he ki ve sarkaar ke faisle ke saath hai lekin unke man ke kisi kone main sadiyon se chali aa rahi azaadi kii yah nemat kho jane kaa dar bhi baitha hua he
 i myself am involved in the celebration of this decision but there is nothing wrong in understanding this fear of women
 vaise bhi ab to jo ja rahaa he, use roka nahin ja saktaa lekin jo ja rahaa he use dekha to ja saktaa he ki jate jate kaise sata rahaa he
 a colleague of ours recorded a video of a houseworker in which he said that he had deposited five thousand rupees from a five hundred rupee note to the granddaughter's wedding
 jab hamaare sahyogi ne kaha ki ise tivi par dikhaa sakate hai to usne haath jod liya ki pati ko pataa chal jayega
 Not only husband, she also saves money from children
 ho saktaa he ki bainkon se judane se wo sambal ke nae tareeke kii aadi ho jaaen lekin itani puraani parampara ja rahi he, kuch to ghabrahat hogi hi
 Why the grandmother insisted on keeping her granddaughter's marriage money secret, the Income Tax Officer can never understand it, nor is it a matter of any finance minister
 isliye doordaraj ke gaanvon or kasbon kii auraton se baat kiijie ki yah sabake hit main he
 There is nothing to fear
 stri dhan kehalaata bhale dhan he magar hota bahut kam he
 This is the last and secret fort of social security in families
 sarkaar ne bhi kaha he ki dhai lakh tak kii raashi auraten aaraam se bank laa sakati hai
 Can be deposited in the account
 unase koi poochtacha nahin hogi
 The question is not of inquiry
 sawaal he pataa chal jane kaa
 What will be the status of the money that our women have not allowed to know for centuries, when the secret will open in their homes
 kya pataa choti si azaadi jane ke badale koi badi azaadi unka intazaar kar rahi ho
 In celebration of black money, i kept turning to the newspapers, watching video footage of colleagues that in a picture we would see those people whom we imagine have money in their sacks
 wo dahaad markar ro rahe honge
 If the line of the banks started, i went to see myself, but the people who were in the line did not feel that they had sack notes in their houses
 kya aise logon ne apane paison ko thikaane laga diya he yaa itminan hai ki jugad kar lenge
 Money will be left in the right bag in the sack
 kuch ne kaha ki ye upar upar hans to rahe hai magar andar andar ro rahe hai
 If any of such people intend to cry outside, then you can contact me
 media inke sannaate ko darj nahin kar paa rahaa he
 If people holding 500, 1000 notes in sacks and beds are very angry then please come on TV and say your mind
 kahen ki maar padi he or kishor kumaar kaa wo gaanaa gaayen ki pataa he tumhen kya, kahaan dard he, yahaan haath rakhana, yahaan dard he
 The trap of sorrow has become good
 patrkaar ne aakar meraa haal to poocha
 At present, what is seen on the streets does not seem to be sacks
 kahin ye log sone chaandi kii dukaanon kii taraf to nahin chale gaye
 If you too leave your little troubles and tell such people, then definitely tell us
 ham bekaar main bank bank kiye ja rahe hai wo apane kamare main hanse hansate lot pot ho rahe honge
 It should not happen
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha he ki 500, 1000 ke noton par lage is bain se agar chunaav ke karch kam hote hai to acchhee baat he
 i am crying for joy in imagining this simplicity of politics
 punjab or upi chunaavon ko paise kii nigaah se dekhiyegaa
 If black money is eliminated, it will be the simplest and ideal election in Indian history
 aapke paise kaa hisaab poocha ja rahaa he ki kahaan se aayaa, lekin aapako pataa to hoga ki raajnneetik dal aapako nahin bataate hai ki unhen kahaan se paisa aayaa
 They tell the Election Commission but not you
 soochna kaa adhikaar unke yahaan lagu nahin he
 There is no PAN card or Aadhar card system
 magar aapke chaar hazaar ke badale pan number maanga ja rahaa he
 Aadhaar card is being sought
 ek anumaan ke mutabik agar kisi dal ko 500 karod rupee chande ke milte hai to uskaa 80 fisadi 20 hazaar se kam kaa hota he jiske daataaon ke naam nahin bataane ke liye unhen chhot mili he
 Why should they get this exemption
 ye sawaal apane netaaon se puuchhiyegaa
 i am sure big leaders will become fans of such questions
 par maan lete hai ki raajnneeti se kaala dhan chalaa gaya to imidiat impact kya hoga
 What will be the immediate effect in Hindi? maan lijie ki raajnneeti se bhi kaala dhan chalaa gaya to kya hoga
 Rallies are happening in UP with so many buses, all of them should stop
 mujhe to lagata he ki upi main bijepi, basapa, congress or sapa ke chaaron netaa ek hi car main raily karne jaaenge
 Will tour UP by car pool
 raajnneeti main car-pool kii pratha chal padegi
 The convoy of cars will end
 aapke bagal se chaar chaar bade netaa guzar jaaenge pataa bhi nahin chalegaa
 Along with the car pool, a new practice of rally pool may also be launched
 yani ek jagah janata jutegi or ek hi manch par chaaron dalon ke bade netaa bhaashan denge
 After listening to everyone, the public will vote
 ham channel vaale bhi ek saath inhen live dikhaa denge
 Posters will also become cheaper
 ek hi poster main chaaron netaa kii tasviir hongi or haath jode vot maangate nazar aaenge
 The copy of the manifest will also print the same
 ek chapter bijepi kaa, ek chapter congress kaa or ek chapter basapa ou ek chapter sapa kaa hoga
 The comments helicopter waalon kii dukaan band ho jaaegi
 At the time of election, the helicopter will rotate the public for free
 ek hi car main chaar chaar netaa jab neeche se upar kii taraf dekhenge to purv kaala dhan kaal ko yaad karte hue aahen bharenge
 The post Black Money Era will be considered a period of simplicity
 guuruuvaar ko bainkon ne logon ko paise dene shuru kar diye
 People kept in line for hours, i also met many such people
 ek baat nazar ai
 These people are upset but are not angry with the government's decision
 kahin se bhi bainkon ke baahar hangaame yaa marpet kii khabare nahin ai tab bhi jab kai jagahon par counter samay se pehle band ho gaye
 Only got two thousand instead of four thousand
 log dhiraj ke saath line main hai
 They are telling their problems but they are not saying that the government has done wrong
 ames main opidi main agar clinical charge 500 se kam hoga to do dinon ke liye bill maaf kar diya gaya he
 Five hundred notes are being taken at the drug stores
 kai log kah rahe hai ki dukandaar 500 lekar chuttay nahin de rahaa he
 Now understand this matter like this
 bazaar main jitani karency he uskaa 86 fisadi paanch sau or hazaar ke note kaa he
 So obviously the remaining fourteen percent will have ten, twenty, fifty and hundred notes
 14 fisadi note se 86 fisadi kii bharpai nahin ho sakati he
 So the shopkeepers are not bullying you
 unke paas chuttay kii vaaki kami hogi isliye nahin de rahe hai

 Not giving special attention to the news of differences between Indian team head coach Anil Kumble and captain Virat Kohli, former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar said that this is common due to the difference of two generations and it is seen in every team
 bhartiya cricket board ne pichley saptaah naye mukhya coach ke liye bhi aavedan mangaaye the, kyonki vartmaan coach kumble kaa kaarykaal june main isisi champions trophy ke saath hi samaapt ho jayega
 Gavaskar also supported the board's decision
 gavaskar ne kaha, ‘bisisiai ne jo kiya meri nigaah main usne prakriya kaa anusaran kiya
 You will never get to see such a situation when the captain and coach of a country have the same opinion
 ’ He said in the 'aaj Tak Salaam Cricket' program, "it is impossible to happen because the coach used to play with the previous generation and hence his attitude is slightly different from the present generation
 maidan par bhale hi yah nahin dikhe, lekin abhyaas satr yaa team sangyojan taiyaar karte samay yah antar saamne aa saktaa he
 i don't think we should take it seriously, because these kinds of discussions are good for the team
 ’ However, Gavaskar praised Kumble, after his coach, India won most of the matches
 unhone kaha, ‘kumble ne coach ke rup main bahut acchhee bhoomika nibhaai he
 i am only talking about the results and when you look at the results of last year, you can say that he did nothing wrong
 ’tippaniyan Gavaskar also said that the coach should be made who takes into account the long-term interests of Indian cricket
 unhone kaha, ‘coach aisa hona chahie jiske paas bhartiya cricket ke liye vijan ho
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Gavaskar said, "in my view, what BCCI did, it followed the process

 ) Srikanth Verma is probably the most energetic Hindi writer after independence
 ve murdhanya kavi hai, sateek kahanikar hai, or anokhe upanyaaskaar
 He is one of those rare poets who endured the melting iron poetic current flowing through them and molded it into completely new poetry
 yah bhi sach he ki kai baar is pighale lohe ke-se kavy-aaveg ne unhen dhiraj barat sakane kaa avkaash nahin diya yaa shaayad apane ghumdate kavy-aaveg ke aage kavi kaa dhiraj nishphal ho gaya, lekin tab yah kavy-aaveg yaa kavy-samvedan unheen kii kavitaaon ke sughad vinyason main aasapaas, yahaan-vahaan chinagaarion kii tarah bikhar gaya
 Perhaps this is why his poems are a unique evidence and function of his poetry-restraint and poetry-incontinence
 unke dhiraj or unki hadabadi donon kaa paardarshee ankan
 Read on Sahitya Aajtak on the birth anniversary of Srikanth Verma Some poems from Srikanth Varma Sanchiyata edited by Udayan Vajpayee
 1
 Every time after writing a love letter, every time a woman who trembles while signing her, gives her the comfort of the weather and the love letter starts again; this time it curses the noise, the wind coming from the window, the knock on the door, a shocking book falling from the shelf, the falling sea with the force on the bed, the palm standing unafraid outside, finally in time
 ghabaraakar dhundti he sara din kisi parityakt ko!2
 The last statement (after this it is useless to say) has put the contract to love the man
 i want to say something else - All the poets are journalists, souls, souls, like cats of politicians are dead, all the earth rises from the sea! Interior can not Laikhn the Rhirhne i Atmahtyakr Hoonn others Kakhun! Do not i can Jhkhmikr you Hoonn you Mujenirstr! You go to your city of god bind Hoonapane hell! 3
 prakriyamein kya kar rahaa thajbasb jayakaar kar rahe the ?main bhi jayakaar kar rahaa tha-dar rahaa thajis tarahsab dar rahe the
 What was i doing when i was saying, 'aziz is my enemy?' i was also saying, 'aziz is my enemy
 ’main kya kar rahaa thajbasb kah rahe the,‘munh mat kholo ?’main bhi kah rahaa tha,‘munh mat kholobolojaisa sab bolte hai
 'cheer is over, Aziz has been killed, his face is closed
 hairat main sab puch rahe hai,yah kaise hua ?jis tarah sab puch rahe hanusi tarah main bhi,yah kaise hua ?4
 Kalinga is only returning to Ashoka and asking for the address of the sublingual, only Ashoka is bowing his head and walking like a subjeet, only Ashoka's ears are screaming and everyone laughing and doubling, only Ashoka has kept his arms

 She was first seen in the TV serial 'banu Main Teri Dulhan'
 uske baad 'ye hai mohabbatein' main apni shandaar abhinay ke badaulat unhone chote parde par khub naam kamaaya or phir 'intjaar', 'misses and mistar sharma elahabadwaale' or 'adaalat' main najar ain
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi said after announcing the demonetisation on 8 November last year that he needed only 50 days from the people of the country
 unhone vaada kiya tha ki 50 din ke baad halaat sudharne lagenge, lekin agar dilli-ensiaar kii baat karen to notebandi ke 100 din puure hone par bhi logon kii mushkilen puri tarah se khatm nahin hui hai
 Aaj Tak's team went to several atms located in Delhi, Ghaziabad and Noida on Wednesday to investigate the situation
 noida-gajiabad ke log pareshanrajdhani dilli se sate upi ke do pramukh shaharon gajiabad or noida ke atm kii padtaal main 20 atm main se keval 4 atm chaalu haalat main mili
 Raj Nagar, the most prominent center of Ghaziabad, has three banks and atms simultaneously
 kotak mahindra, idibiai or indsind bank ke, par teenon main cash nahi tha
 No cash board was found in them
 public kaa kahana he ki halaat main sudhaar nahin hua he
 a man came from far away with his daughter, thinking that there are three atms here, cash will be found somewhere, but despair came
 gajiabad ke patel nagar chowk main ek saath chaar atm hai-exis, echdiefasi, indicash or pienbi par chaaron atm main cash nahi the
 Axis and Punjab National Bank had a shutter down
 gord kaa kahana he ki jab se notebandi hui he, isamen keval do baar cash daalaa gaya he
 a person who came to withdraw cash at Bank of Baroda ATM in Patel Nagar said that 90 percent atms of Ghaziabad are not running
 noida sector 51 main ek saath 5 bainko ke atm hai-karnataka, indsind, vijaya, corporation or elahabaad bank ke, lekin keval ek atm chaalu haalat main mila jisamen jisamen qatari lagi thi
 Sector 18 is the most prominent market in Noida, every bank has its main branches here
 sabase pehle ham echdiefasi bank gaye, bank ke neeche bane donon atm main cash khatm kaa board laga he
 Going forward, three banks meet
 teen bainkon ke atm main se keval esbiai ke atm se cash mil rahaa tha
 Both Yes Bank atms were empty
 isi tarah, exis bank kaa atm bhi bina cash mila
 Long queues outside the sole running SBI ATM were reminiscent of the early days of demonetisation
 kai log bahut naaraaz dikhe, kuch log to kai kilometre dur se aae the
 Even the people of Delhi were not relieved when our team went to Delhi University in North Delhi, only one of the atms of two banks located there was running
 chaalu haalat vaale atm se bhi sirf 2000 ke note hi nikal rahe the
 The Canara Bank ATM located in Kamla Nagar has been closed for the last 3 days and will remain closed for the next three days
 logo kii maane to is atm kii aria main sabase achhi sarvice hai ,lekin aaj yahaan taala laga he or log pareshaan hai
 No cash board is installed at the ATM located at HDFC Bank branch in Vijay Nagar
 is atm par aasapaas kaa bahut bada residential aria nirbhar karata hai , lekin abhi logon ko 3 se 5 atm ghoomane ke baad hi cash yaa phir koi varking atm miltaa he
 Here ICICI Bank and ATM are both together but there is no cash in ATM, so people are withdrawing money by filling forms from the bank by putting them in line
 model toun main ek saath 2 bade bank inds or yes bank kaa atm hai, lekin donon main cash khatm ho gaya he
 If people believe that there are no atms in all the atms on this entire line
 lihaaza logon ko dobaaraa atm ke chakkar lagane pad rahe hai
 If this is the case then the queue of people at the ATM can begin

 a retired American Navy officer has been sentenced to life imprisonment for killing an Indian engineer, Srinivas Kuchibhotla, last year in Kansas City because of ethnic hatred
 america nausena main rah chuke 52 varshiya adam purinton ne 22 farvari, 2017 ko 'get out of maai country' chillaate hue 32 varshiya kuchibhotla ko goli maar di thi
 In March this year, Purinton confessed to the murder of Kuchibhotla
 purinton ko kuchibhotla kii hatya ke alaava kuchibhotla ke dost alok madasani or paas main hi khadey ek anya vyakti kii hatya kii koshish karne kaa doshi paaya gaya
 The entire incident took place in a bar in Oleith City
 kuchibhotla ko goli maarane ke baad purinton baar se bhaagane laga to kuchibhotla ke dost alok or ek anya vyakti ne uskaa peechha kiya
 Purinton had opened fire on them as well
 consaas city ke ek fedral court ne shuukravaar ko purinton ko kuchibhotla kii hatya ke liye umrakaid or do anya logon kii hatya kii koshish karne ke prayek jurm ke liye 165 maheene kii sajaa sunai gai
 Kuchibhotla is survived by his wife Sunayana Dumla
 court kaa faisla aane ke baad sunayana ne kaha, 'mere pati kii hatya ke maamle main jo sajaa sunai gai he, usase mere pati to waapas nahin aaenge
 But this punishment definitely gives a strong message that hatred can never be accepted
 'sunayana ne saath hi nyaay dilaane ke liye district etorni offis or oleth police kaa shukriya bhi adaa kiya

 com / 311aotydbf Let us know that the CBI will present the BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar and his partner Shashi Singh, accused of Unnao rape, in Tis Hazari court of Delhi on Monday
 supreme court ke aadesh ke baad unnav cond se jude paanch main se chaar maamalon ko upi se transfar karke dilli laayaa gaya he
 On Saturday, a court of district judge Dharmesh Sharma, in Tis Hazari, took cognizance and issued a production warrant for Sanger and his accomplice
 vidhayak kuldeep senger or uske sahyogi ko pesh karne ke baad sibiai chaaron maamle main jaanch ke liye remand maang sakati he
 Besides transferring the hearing of the case, the entire process of jail transfer of Kuldeep Singh Sengar and his associate Shashi Singh will also be done on the direction of the court
 jaankaree ke mutabik donon aropiyon ko dilli kii tihaad jail main bheja ja saktaa he
 The cases transferred from the Supreme Court include rape, gang-rape of a minor girl, Arms Act case registered against the girl's father and death of the father in custody
 duusari taraf sibiai kuldeep senger ke awaason samet uttar pradesh ke chaar jilon main darjanabhar sthanon par chaape maare
 a senior CBI official said, "CBI searched the premises of the accused and others in Lucknow, Unnao, Banda and Fatehpur
 lakhanu main gomti nagar sthit senger ke thikaanon par talaashi kii gai
 Sengar was questioned by the CBI on Saturday in Sitapur Jail
 bataa den ki pichley maheene 28 july ko hui sadak durghatana ke baad bhaajapa ne senger ko party se nikaal diya tha
 The Unnao rape victim and her lawyer were seriously injured in the accident, and the victim's two relatives died
 peedita kii haalat abhi bhi najuk he or vah ventilator par he
 Doctors said he had pneumonia and could not be removed from the ventilator even on trial
 sibiai ke varisht adhikariyon ne ravivaar ko durghatana vaale trek ke maalik or clinar se bhi poochtacha kii
 Deepika Padukone is currently in discussion with her video 'may Choice' on women's empowerment
 is video ko logon kii milijuli pratikriya mili he
 After this, the mail version of this video has also arrived
 you tub par aplod kiye gaye is video ko bhi blike or white vijuals ke saath thik vaise hi filmaaya gaya he jaisaa ki deepika vaala'maay chwwis'video he
 In this mail version video, a man's feelings have been described and his rights have been talked about
 is video main ek choti si video clip bhi shaamil kii gai he jisamen ek aurat ko apane pati ke saath maar peet karte hue dikhaaya gaya he
 In this clip, it is shown that the husband is with another girl after marriage and his wife is opposing him
 is clip ko dikhaane kaa matlab haidipikadwara apni video main yah baat rakhana ki shaadi ke baad aurat kisase sambandh banaae yah uski marji
 In the same way in this mail version, the talk of man's will has been talked about
 is video ke ant main ek massej bhi likhaa gaya he Respect women & men
 Ankur Poddar has directed this video
 dekhen 'maay chwwis' mail varjan video: India is home to around 200 million Muslims, where they have the constitutional right to practice their religious traditions with full independence
 or yahi adhikaar unhen islamic kanoon sharia ko apnaane kii bhi aazaadee detaa he
 The Supreme Court's decision in this case is an excellent example of giving justice
 dharmik samudaay ke taur par musalamaanon ko apni dharmik panraparaaon jaise namaaj, rojaa, haj or jakaat jaise maamalon ko spasht tareeke se samajhane kii jarurat he
 One needs to know the fatwa first
 fatwa kisi samasya kaa samaadhaan he
 This is the Sharia answer to a question
 daarul kaja ke faisle or fatve ko jabaran thopa nahin ja saktaa
 Darul Kaja in India clearly does not have a parallel justice system
 isiilie iske faislon ko lagu karne ke liye koi agency nahin he
 These courts only play the role of arbitrator and advisor
 jo daarul kaja or sharai adaalat main jate hai, unka unamem vishwaas hota he or ve un par sharai adaalaton main apane masale le jane ke liye baadhya nahin hote
 One also needs to understand the difference between Darul Kaja and Darul Ifta
 daarul kaja do yaa do se adhik logon se jude paariwarik jhagadon jaise shaadi, talaak aadi main faisla letaa he yaa madhyasth kii bhoomika nibhaataa he, jabaki daarul iftaa main aapke sawaalon ke jawaab shariat kii roshni main die jate hai
 In it, the solution to your problems is told
 isliye donon maamalon main sawaal yah he ki koun log daarul iftaa or daarul kaja ke daravaaje khatkhataate hai
 Like lawyer Vishwan Lochan Madan, a lot of people think that how can a parallel justice system run in the country
 asal main madan ne supreme court main is bare main yachika daalkar bhala hi kiya or sarvocch adaalat ne apane faisle se sara bhram dur kar diya
 The court's decision in this regard showed that Darul Kaja and Darul Ifta were not against the constitution
 ye sansthaaen buniyadi taur par musalamaanon kii bhalaai ke liye hai or inkaa beja istemaal nahin hona chahie
 The Muslim ulema has also always taken care not to give any controversial decision or fatwa
 madan ne jis imrana maamle kaa hawala diya usamen kisi patrkaar ne sharaarat ke iraade se fatwa liya tha
 No Darul Ifta advised Imrana to leave the house of the husband
 talaak yaa khulaa ke maamle main sharia kanoon par amal kiya jaataa he
 For example, if her husband is very ruthless with a woman and all the ways to keep her relationship better become useless, then that woman can apply for open or separation from her husband
 sharai adaalat us aurat kii arji ko sweekaar kar use uske shuhar se alag karne or shantipurna jindagi bitaane kii aazaadee detii he
 After that the woman is also free to get married again
 yahaan main ek or misaal dena chaahunga ki kisi aurat ko uske shuhar ne kanuunan talaak die bagaiyr alag-thalag chhod diya to vah aurat aman or izzat ke saath jindagi gujaarne ke apane sharai adhikaar ke tahat khulaa le sakati he
 If a woman's husband is missing for a long time, then she can also ask for divorce ie open
 samvidhan ke prati puri aasthaa vyakt karte hue main kahana chaahunga ki sharai adaalatein madhyasth or salaahkaar kii bhoomika nibhaakar desh kii adaalaton main lambit maamalon kaa boj kam kar sakati hai
 Their biggest feature is that they work free of cost
 (lekhak saharanpur ke naayab shahar kaaji hai) Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Anand Kumar were expelled from the party late on Monday night
 ye wo chehre hai jinhone apni vaicharik gaharaai se aam aadmi party ko gambheertha di

 Prashant Bhushan was not in favor, later the leaked videos were telling, Yogendra Yadav's political ability had become clear with the results of Haryana
 tippaniyan Perhaps Arvind knew that it was time to move beyond ideological, intellectual symbols
 jaise anna ne bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai ko andolan kaa rup diya yaa phir aruna raay ke saath jo artiai ke kshetra main seedhi mili
 Now the time had come to climb another ladder and Arvind took over the reins of the Delhi elections
 unako maat dene kii koshishen bhi huin
 Whatever happened Arvind Kejriwal prevailed over them all
 dilli main aitihaasik jeet darj kii or sarkaar main ek bhi mantralay apane paas nahin rakhaa
 However, the Delhi government is looking to work

 It will be interesting to see who remains in it or not

 Yogendra Yadav suffered a crushing defeat in Haryana
 narendra modi kaa asar aravind kejariwal ne khud mahasoos kiya
 Upon leaving Delhi's power, he apologized and was exposed to his weaknesses in the battle of Benares
 sirf 4 siton par simati aap ke rajanithik bhavishya par prashn chinh lag chukaa tha
 Arvind Kejriwal tried to form a government with the Congress again in these moments and it was probably from here that the process of mutual differences started
 prashanth bhushan paksh main nahin the, baad main li kiye video ye bayaan kar rahe the, yogendra yadav kii raajnneetik kshamta haryana ke nateezon se saaf ho hi gai thi
 The comments shaayad aravind jaan chuke the ki ab vaicharik, bauddhik pratikon se aage badhane kaa samay aa gaya he
 For example, Anna gave the fight against corruption as a movement or with Aruna Roy who got a ladder in the field of RTI
 ab ek or seedhi chadhane kaa samay aa gaya tha or aravind ne dilli chunaavon ke sanchaalan kii bagdor apane haathon main le lee
 There were also attempts to beat him
 jitani bhi hui ho aravind kejariwal un sab par baari pade
 Recorded a historic victory in Delhi and did not retain a single ministry in the government

 Be it electricity bills or now the issue of farmers, Arvind Kejriwal's political train has moved forward

 The affidavit claimed that as soon as VK Singh took over as army chief in 2010, action was taken against some top army officers who took flats in the society
 sena pramukh kaa kaarybhaar sambhalate hi wike singh ne sadarn cmand ko patr likhakar adarsh ke bare main puri jaankaree ikkatha karne kaa aadesh diya

 mishan 2019 ke tahat uttar pradesh ke daure par nikle pradhanmantri narendra modi shanivaar ko azamgarh pahunche
 Here he laid the foundation stone of the state's biggest project Purvanchal Expressway
 iske saath hi unhone jahaan upi kii yogi sarkaar ko kaamyaab qaraar diya, vahiin musalamaanon ke mudde par congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko gheraa
 Addressing the public meeting, PM Modi recently criticized Rahul Gandhi's meeting with the Muslim community
 rahul gandhi kaa naam liye bina unhone kaha ki congress ke namdaar kah rahe hai ki unki party musalamaanon kii he
 Earlier, Manmohan Singh had said that the first right on the resources of the country is that of Muslims, but the Congress should tell that their party belongs to Muslim men and not to women? Actually, after Rahul Gandhi's meeting, there was news in Urdu media that Rahul Gandhi has described Congress as a party of Muslims
 jise aadhaar banaate hue piem modi ne aaj yah tippanee kii or teen talaak par congress party ke stand ko lekar rahul gandhi ko gherne kii koshish kii
 PM Modi said that while the central government is making efforts to make the lives of women easier, these parties are working together to put the lives of women and especially Muslim sisters and daughters in more trouble
 unhone kaha, 'lakhon-karodon muslim bahanon kii maang thi ki teen talaak ko band kiya jaae, lekin sansad main kanoon paas nahin hone diya gaya

 Due to debt, the accused carried out the incident
 police ne bataaya ki teen din pehle bachche ke apharan kii soochna swaroop nagar thane main darj hui thi
 After the information about the kidnapping of the businessman's child, the top officials also started investigating the seriousness of the case
 police ne sabase pehle sisitivi khangaalane shuru kiye
 After watching all the cctvs in the area, the needle of police suspicion went to a car of UP number
 police ko car ke antim chaar disit mili jo saafe nahin dikhaai de rahe the
 After much effort, the police came to know about him, and later it was found that the car belonged to a person named Shivkumar
 police ne bataaya ki shiv kumaar agra ke fatehabad main rahata he
 The police arrived in Fatehabad while investigating and questioned Shivkumar in custody and found that he was the brother of the child's father Brijmohan from a distant relationship
 sivakumar ne apane ek anya saathi narendra ke saath milakar bharat ke apharan kii yojana banaai
 When Bharat came to pick up someone in the market at 3 o'clock, Shivakumar kidnapped him on the pretext of taking the factory to his father
 sivakumar par tees lakh kaa karj tha, jisaki vajah se usne narendra ke saath milakar bharat ke apharan kii yojana banaai thi
 Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma will soon write a letter to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on the issue of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the politically sensitive multi-brand retail sector, seeking his support
 brusselles kii do din kii yatra par aae sharma ne bataaya ki maharashtra, haryana, andhra pradesh, dilli, assam, rajasthan tathaa kerala ke mukhyamantriyon ne pehle hi khudara kshetra main epadiai ke samarthan par likhit aashwaasan diya he
 Sharma said, 'I have written a letter to the Chief Ministers of the three non-congress ruled states of Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab on this issue
 main jald bihar ke mukhyamantri ko patr likhane ja rahaa hum
 According to sources, the Kerala government is of the view that states that want to open multi-brand retail stores should be allowed this
 sharma ne teen gaiyr congress shasit rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ko likhe patr main kaha he ki 550 arab dollars ke is kshetra ko kholane se gramin yuvaaon ko rojgaar ke avasar uplabdh honge or ve puri krishi kaarobaar shrinkhalaa main anshadharak ban sakenge
 Mohammed Shami, Mohit Sharma and Umesh Yadav, this is the trio that has given Team India a convincing win in five consecutive matches in the current World Cup
 is dauraan team india ne jo 50 wicket hasil kiye hai, unamem se 26 wicket inhen teenon ke naam rahe
 In these five matches, India's fast bowlers have done the work that hardly anyone could have imagined
 tej gendbaazon kii tikdi ne jo 26 wicket hasil kiye hai, unamem short pich gendon ke jariye 15 wicket chatkaaye gaye hai
 Neither the Australian bowlers nor South Africa have been able to make such good use of short pitch balls in this World Cup
 ye chaunkaane vaala pradarshan isliye he kyonki bharat ke tej gendbaaz kabhi aisi gendbaaji ke liye nahin pahachaane gaye
 This is the reason why Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the captain of the team is also very happy on this success
 unhone kaha he ki hamaare gendbaaz short pichon kaa naa to zyada istemaal kar rahe hai or naa hi kam
 It is clear that Dhoni's use of short pitched balls is causing havoc on the opposition team
 itnaa hi nahin australia or newzealand main khele ja rahe world cap ke muqaabalon ke dauraan shami-umesh or mohit kii tikdi lagaataar 145 kilometre prati ghante se zyada kii raftaar se gendbaazi kar rahi he
 This aspect has also shocked the veterans
 westeindies ke mashhoor cricketer bryan lara ne enditivi se kaha he ki hamane kabhi isaki kalpana nahin kii thi
 He said how at one time he was the only fast bowler like Srinath to be brought into the Indian team
 lekin maujuuda samay main ek ke baad ek teen gendbaazon kii teji or oochaal bhari genden vipakshi team kaa boria bistar samet rahi he
 Obviously, the pressure the three bowlers are making from their line and length is also benefitting the team's spinners
 ab team india ke liye nokout mukaable shuru hone vaale hai, aise main tej gendbaazon kii tikdi kaa karishma jari rahe, bharat kaa har cricket phens yahi ummid kar rahaa he
 Top leaders of the government will often find themselves saying that they will build the road, Delhi will shine, develop, but the reality tells something else
 dilli kii ek aisi sadak ko banavaane ke daawey to bahut kiye par hua kuch nahin
 Regarding the broken road of Kalindi, Netaji's answer is that if the road is bad then change the way
 dilli-noida ko jodne vaali kalindi kunj kii sadak puri tarah se tuuti he
 This road connects Sarita Vihar to Kalindi Kunj
 is sadak main rojaanaa kareeb ek lakh se zyada log guzarate hai, lekin sarkaar is sadak par koi dhyaan hi nahin de rahi he
 The transport department also has a very cold attitude towards this road
 sadak puri tarah se tuuti-phooti he or aay din yahaan dughartnaayen bhi hoti rahati hai
 Delhi Government's Urban Development Minister Raj Kumar Chauhan recently laid the foundation stone of a newly elevated road in his area, but when he was asked about the broken road in Kalindi, he replied that if the road is bad then you change your path Take it

 Manmohan Singh has banned the media bill
 pradhamantri ne sabhi news channelon ko bharosa dilaayaa he ki sabake saath vichaar vimarsh karne ke baad hi antim faisla liya jayega
 Significantly, all media people have united in protest against this bill
 saath hi is masale par raajnneeti bhi ho rahi he
 Many political parties have opposed the banning of media
 media par sensorship ke idia se pehle se hi congress se naaraaz chal rahe samaajawaadee party ke netaa bhi khush nahin hai
 According to party general secretary Amar Singh, this will end freedom of expression, and they will also go to meet the Prime Minister on this issue
 bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh ke mutabik wo media par kisi bhi kism kii pabandi ke khilaaf hai
 The BJP president says that the government should talk to all political parties before taking any decision
 jediu adhyaksh sharad yadav bhi media ko kisi daayre main baandhne ke khilaaf hai
 According to Sharad Yadav, there should be a debate in the House on this issue, talk to all media groups too, but there should be no attempt to curb this voice of democracy
 sipiem ne bhi media par ankush lagane kii koshish kaa virodh kiya he
 Sitaram Yechury has said that there should be an independent regulatory mechanism for the media

 Chandrashekhar Azad, the chief of the Bhim Army, has been stopped before reaching the bhima-koregaon memorial site just before the anniversary of the violence that erupted last year in bhima-koregaon, Maharashtra
 prashasan ne unhen bhima-koregaanv main raily karne kii anumati nahin di he
 Not only this, even the Bombay High Court could not get permission to rally Chandrashekhar Azad
 isse pehle chandrashekhar aaazaad ravivaar ko baari police suraksha ke bich pune pahunche the
 In this regard, Bhin Army supporter Nitin Satpute filed a petition in the Bombay High Court seeking permission to rally
 iske alaava pune police par chandrashekhar aaazaad ko hiraasat main lene kaa aarope bhi lagaaya gaya tha
 The Bombay High Court has asked the Pune Police, who were hearing this matter, to reply by January 4
 haalanki pune police ne adaalat ko bataaya ki azaad na to police hiraasat main the or na hi unhen najarband kiya gaya he
 Apart from this, the administration has said not to allow the rally
 isse pehle shuukravaar ko khabar ai thi ki bhim army adhyaksh chandrashekhar aaazaad ke mumbai police ne hiraasat main le liya he or unhen malad hotel manila main najarband kar rakhaa gaya he
 The police denied these allegations
 bataa den ki shanivaar ko chandrashekhar ko mumbai ke aaazaad maidan main ek raily ko sambodhit karne vaale the
 However, the rally was canceled due to the organizers not getting permission from the administration for the event
 gauratlab he ki pichley saal ek janvari ko us vakt hinsa bhadak uthi thi, jab dalit samaaj ke log east india company ke sainikon kii peshwa kii sena par hui jeet kii 200veen jayanti manaane koregaanv bhima gaye the

 One person lost his life in violence white house kii ore se jari or america raashtrapati donald trump kaa dastakhat kiya hua ek patr in dinon america main apni kai khaamiyon kii vajah se khaasaa charchaa kaa vishay bana hua he
 Many suggestions on the mistakes were that the White House sent a counter letter to the female teacher, but this English teacher found many mistakes in writing and style of writing in the letter and marked it with a yellow marker and made several omissions
 Pointing back sent the letter
 saath hi unhonepatrake kai hisson par kuch suzav bhi die gaye
 At the top of the letter, the grammar and writing style on the left side spoke to be checked, while on the letter n at the beginning of the word nation (nation) under the letter, he wrote that OMG this is wrong
 skool kii suraksha par likhaa tha patravhite housaki ore se georgia keatlantamen rahane vaali 61 saal kii von mason ko sambodhit karte hue 3 may ko i-mail ke jariye ek patr jari kiya gaya
 Von Maison has been a high school teacher and she retired last year, but her copy-checking habit still hasn't gone away and she found several flaws in the letter from the White House, the president's official residence
 unhone patr main kai sudhaar karte hue uski ek photo khinchi or use fasebuk par post kar diya
 They also sent it back to the White House
 unhone kaha ki isamen kaaphi galtiyaan hai, main aisi kharaab lekhnee ko bardaasht nahin kar sakati
 If there is any scope for improvement, it should be done
 skool firing ko lekar likhaa tha pataatlanta main rahane vaali miss mason ek democrate hai or unhonerashtrapati trampake naam se ek patr likhaa jisamen unhone farvari main florida ke parkland ke ek skool main hui firing main maare gaye 17 logon ke parijanon se baari-baari se milane kii baat kahi thi
 In response to the same letter, President Trump's signature letter was sent to Miss Maison, but Maison, a school teacher, saw many mistakes in it
 haalanki neuyork times ke anusaar, javaabi patr main sarkaar ne teacher kii ore se uthaae gaye muddon par kuch khaas nahin kaha
 Mason admitted that she wrote a letter to the White House in great dismay because she wanted to do something for the families of those affected by the incident
 haalanki soshal media main vah trol bhi ho gayi kyonki kai logon kaa kahana he ki unhone kai jagah sahi likhe shabdon ko bhi galat qaraar diya

 The Supreme Court Collegium has averted a direct confrontation with the government
 ek jaj ke naam par aapattiyon or file phir se vichaar ke liye waapas aane ke baad un jaj kaa naam duusare hoicourt kaa chif justise banane kii sifarish kar di he
 The Supreme Court Collegium has sent its recommendation to the government for appointment of Chief Justices for seven High Courts of the country, including the Delhi High Court running without a permanent Chief Justice for the last nine months
 charchit jaj justise ke em joseph sahit teen nyaayadhishon ko supreme court laane kii siforishein bhi sarkaar ko bhej di gai hai
 According to a letter from the Supreme Court Collegium, about three months after the central government returned from here with a suggestion for re-consideration, Uttarakhand High Court Chief Justice KM Joseph has once again been nominated to the Supreme Court Justice
 colegium ne is baar do anya hoicourt ke chif justise ke saath joseph ke naam kii sifarish nahin kii he, balki punarvichaar ke baad phir se unke naam kii sifarish ekadam alag se kii he
 Apart from Joseph, the Collegium has also recommended bringing Madras High Court Chief Justice Indira Banerjee and Odisha High Court Chief Justice Vineet Sharan

 bollywood ke senior actor dilip kumaar kii zamin ko lekar shuru vivaad thamane kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 In the land dispute, the court ordered Dilip Kumar that he must give an undertaking by June 2018
 haalanki dilip ne abhi tak ye anderteking nahin di he
 Rather, he appealed against this order in the Bombay High Court
 ab justise kolabwala ne dilip kumaar ke vakil se poocha he ki kya ve agle ek hafte ke andar anderteking dene vaale hai?darasal, yah vivaad dilip kumaar ke paali hill bangala number-16 ko lekar he jo 1,600 vargametre ke kshetrafal main failaa hua he
 The value of the property is said to be more than 250 crores
 50 ke dashak main is property ko dilip kumaar ne khatau trust se 999 saal kii leez par liya tha
 During the year 2000, Dileep and his wife Saira Banu decided to develop this property and decided to build apartments instead of the bungalow on this property
 dilip kumaar or unki patni ne is kaam ke liye prajita devleppers privet limited ko chunaa
 This company had also worked to develop the property of Amjad Khan and many other such stars
 property par apartments banane ke liye dilip kumaar ko trust ke parmishan or sartificket kii bhi jarurat thi jo dilip kumaar ne 2001 main hasil kar liya tha
 Prajitha Developers started construction by breaking the old bungalow
 haalanki is dauraan samir bhojawaani naam ke ek shaks ne property par apana daawa thonk diya
 Sameer claims that he owns all the properties of Khatau Trust
 bhojawaani ne 21 disambar 2018 ko ek saarvajanik notice jari kar ghoshnaa kii thi ki ve is sampatti ke maalik hai
 Bhojwani had also claimed that Dilip Kumar is the only lessee of the property
 dilip kumaar or samir bhojawaani ke vivaad ke bich prajita devleppers paanch saalon tak apane kaam ko nahin kar paaya
 Some time ago the real owner of the property, the Seth Moolraj Khatau Trust (SMKT), clearly stated that the actor is the permanent lessee of the property and not the tenant, as is being said
 trustee ne kaha ki dilip kumaar ke paas is sampatti kaa 999 saalon tak ke liye patta he
 But after this, Prajitha Developers alleged that Saira Banu selected two additional builders for the construction work
 ye dekhte hue prajita devleppers ne apana hissaa maangana shuru kar diya
 Initially, Dilip Kumar and Saira Banu gave Rs 20 crore to Prajitha Developers
 haalanki nyaayakarta ko ehsaas hua ki ye kaaphi kam he lekin prajita devleppers ke dwaara maanga gaya 176 karod bhi kaaphi zyada tha
 On 31 May 2018, the judge ordered that Dilip Kumar will give an undertaking according to which he cannot give any part of this property to anyone until the dispute is resolved
 court ne order diya ki ye anderteking dilip kumaar ko june 2018 tak deni hogi
 However, Dilip has not given this undertaking yet
 unhone bombai hoicourt main order ke khilaaf apil bhi kii he
 But the court wants to know from Dilip's lawyer whether the famous actor will give undertaking for the next one week? Earlier, Dilip and Saira appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis
 haalanki jab is celebrity kapal ko bhi koi pratikriya nahin mili to javaabi palatwaar karte hue samir bhojawaani ko manahani kaa notice bhej diya
 In 2003, Dileep along with his wife are living in Bungalow No-34 in the same area of bandra West
 bhartiya cricket team ke purv captain anil kumble bhale hi indian premier lig (ipel) ke chauthe sanskaran main royal chalangers bangalore (aaarasibi) kii ore se nahin khel rahe hon lekin unka anubhav team ke khilaadiyon ko miltaa rahegaa
 RCB owner Vijay Mallya says Kumble's role will be crucial in building a balanced team for the fourth IPL
 kumble ipel ke pichley do sanskarnon main aaarasibi team ke captain rahe the lekin vyavsaayik vyastata ke kaaran vah bataur khilaadi maidan par nahin khelenge haalanki is dauraan unke anubhav kaa laabh team ke yuva khilaadiyon ko miltaa rahegaa
 Mallya said, "kumble is excited to share his experience with the young players of the team
 vah team ke coach se bhi baatcheet shuru karenge
 " sabarmati ke tat par hindustan kii siyasat kii nai gaatha rachi ja rahi he
 When Narendra Damodardas Modi roars by standing on the rubble of the demolished aspirations of the rivals, his winning spirit creates a far greater expression than the proud testimony of the politics of prosperity
 ek aise mulk main jahaan shaasha varg kaa mizaaj apni avam kii aakankshaon se mail nahin khaataa, gandhinagar kii gaddi par unki hetric darasal netritv kii ummid or sankalp ke inaam kaa ek mila-jula majamoon gadhati he
 His stature and scope of success is clearly demonstrated in 3D that when power, even the control of autocratic power, is in the hands of an honest and far-sighted leader, political power does not necessarily corrupt him; Such power can also bring a mandate of change
 aaj bharat par raaj karne waalon kii nekanami jis tarah chur-chur ho rahi he, uske maddenjar badlaav kaa paryaay modi ko bananaa hi tha
 The speed with which they are moving upwards, obviously their scope is to become bigger than the Sahdars of Gujarat
 yah jeet nahin he balki us agali or isse badi jang ke pehle kaa mahaj ek padaav he, jo sabase oonchi satta ke liye ladi jaani baaki he
 But even the weapons of that war will not be different from the battle this time
 faisle ke din gujarat ke jangi maidan main agar hamen sirf ek shaks khadaa dikhataa he, to yah najaara bharat ke sabase lokapriy mukhyamantri or rashtriya prashansakon vaale bijepi ke iklaute kshetreey netaa kii siyasat kii taid karata he
 The name of this politics is Modiism, which is the most popular idea of indian right-wing today
 isamen achche arthshaastra or prachaar aadhaarit raajnneeti kaa bejod mishran he
 Modi is that rare Hindu nationalist who does not borrow money from Indian myths to create his political idiom, even though he is being stamped as an ideological flag bearer
 ve apana janopayogi kaccha maal sidhe ikkisvin sadi ke bazaar se kharidte hai
 When Modi is playing, he is not a seller of great past like many right-wingers elsewhere
 isiilie modi ke tisare sanskaran ko padaa baari vot darasal aadhuniktaa kaa prachaar-prasar karne vaale ko mila janadesh he jisane is desh kii aabaadi main munaafe kii sabase badi fasal kaati he
 It is the crop of youth whom Modi promised the future
 ek aise daur main jab profeshnal netaa apni vishwasaneeyata bachaane kii jaddojahad main jute hai, rajkaaj ke maamle main modi kaa record raaj karne vaale ek netaa main jaruri gunon ko rekhaankit karata he: eemaandaaree or aarthik morche par nattejey dene kaa hunar
 From this perspective, the mandate of Gujarat 2012 will see a referendum on the brand Modi
 thik yahi haal paanch saal pehle tha or 10 saal pehle bhi
 Yes, the opening story was a bit blurred and frightening
 10 saal pehle godhra ke baad hue sampradayik narsanhaar ke thik baad ve gujarat kii janata se vot maangane gaye the
 The sight of the burning train of Godhra to a stunned Hindu psyche was just a small version of the height of 9 / 11
 is kahani ko militant bahusnkhyakon kii khun kii pyaas hi anjaam tak pahunchaati thi, jabaki modi raaj ke kurte par pade khun ke chhinte saaf hone kaa naam hi nahin le rahe the
 At that time, Modi was not a "development man", he was a brave hero of Hindu nationalism
 2002 kaa vidhansabha chunaav to unhone raashtra ke naam par fatah kiya, or jaahir he us vakt unke bechney ke liye miyaan musharraf kaa naam hi kaaphi tha
 The Muslim votes which once slipped from their hands, did not return till today
 paanch saal baad 2007 main unhone mardaana hindutv kaa mukhauta jarur odhe rakhaa, lekin tab logon ko jutaney kaa aujaar vikaas or gujarat kaa aarthik suchakank tha, jo bharat ke mukaable kahin behatar tha
 This stamped his own idiom of 'yes we can'
 paanch saal pehle shuru hua unka safar vikaas kii siyasat karne vaale bharat ke sabase akkhad hathyogi kaa prasthaan bindu rahaa
 In his third ie 2012 Gujarat, his pace has increased and his tongue is directly blazing fire
 isamen sandeshvahak or sandesh donon hi modi hai
 Among them is the topped messenger with his words, which extends more than his 56-inch-wide chest
 ve gujarat ke sisero (roman darshanik, vaktaa, vakil, siyaasi siddhantkaar) hai
 Fatawaz and satirist, "time and sarcastic
" bhartiya raajnneeti kaa yah sabase asardaar vaktaa apane unmaadi shrotaaon ke dimag par kabja karne ke liye kisse gande kii har tarkeeb apanaataa he
 Everything is limited in administration and leadership, development and national prestige
 uske liye gujarat ek udhaaharan he, asal vishay to hindustan he
 During his campaigning, Modi consistently described Gujarat as a model and plundered the India that ruled UPA
 unhone apane bhaashan main gujarat congress ke netaaon ko to ratti bhar jagah nahin di, unke liye ve tuchh the
 His targets have been those who have spoiled the name of the country: Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 unke sambodhano main donon gandhi khandaani raajnneeti ke chehre kii tarah aate jabaki manmohan singh kamajori or netritvheenata kaa pratik hote
 In order to bring life to his point, he skillfully combined the miraculous and wide-ranging impact of high-tech and old tried street politics
 yah parampara ke saath-saath 3di takanic kii ek siyaasi khichdi thi
 Narendra Modi wanted to win Gujarat for the good of India
 ve yah sandesh ghar-ghar tak le ja rahe the
 Now the question arises that will they be able to win India? His own picture, created by Modi himself on the canvas of Gujarat, gives the impression of a leader who needs India today
 ek aarthik sudhaarak ke taur par der se hi sahi lekin durust ubhare manmohan singh vastav main netritv kaa koi adarsh pesh nahin karte
 Everything about UPA-2 is around corruption and the Prime Minister, who is neither a leader by nature nor a profession, has consistently failed to bring transparency or accountability within the administration
 modi ne manmohan kii jaalim ‘‘chuppi’’ ko sarerah hawa main oochhaalane kaa koi bhi mauka nahin chukaa he
 Rahul, who is still waiting in the queue and the Congress's chief campaigner, has not yet proved to this country that he will be different, nor does he have any future slogan that can tie people up
 bharat kii aarthik vruddhi kii chamakdaar daastaan par se mulammaa utar chukaa he or raajnneetik netritv jadta kii jimmedaari lene se batch nahin saktaa
 In contrast, Modi's Gujarat is showing that good politics and good economics can go hand in hand
 sari bahason kaa ant isi jumale par aakar hota ki-naamuraad, baat to ek adad netritv kii he
 Similar things can be said about BJP
 congress ko agar alaakaman kii khinchi lakshmana rekha se baahar nikalnaa gavaara nahin, to bijepi bhi aise netaaon kaa ek bajabajaata chhatta he
 However, the real leaders who have the power to show some of his taxes are in states not at the center
 pichley aam chunaavon main dil tod dene vaali haar ke baavjood dhartipakad dhurandhar netaa kii kasamasaahat unhen maidan nahin chhodie de rahi
 In this party, those who have been dubbed as the next generation and whose hair is getting caught, the appeal of them does not reach the lower level
 bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke baad bhi apane pad par ade party adhyaksh ko bharosa he ki unke kaarobaari or raajnneetik hiton ke bich kahin koi takaraav nahin he
 At a time when the biggest crisis of Indian politics is moral and its biggest mirror is the UPA standing back on the allegations of corruption, in such a situation, the party which once defines itself as having all the moral teachings to save its president Know which shelves have been kept safe
 party ke kaamyaab mukhyamantriyon main kuch hi rashtriya str par apane naam kii pahchaan kaa daawa kar sakate hai
 Modi stands apart because his name alone is the most salable in the entire country, no matter what opinion poll
 lekin pradhanmantri kii kursi ke liye takaraati bauni mahatvakankshaon or popeli khudgargiyon vaali ek party ke bheetar modi ko sabake baraabar hi pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 Apparently, those who are scared of their success have a valid reason for this: they lost two seats this time in 117 seats in 2007
 modi bhale na maane ki ve gujarat se zyada bade ho chuke hai lekin unki taarkik parinti to dilli hi he
 To reach here, however, he must first win the battle of his political family
 ab tak ve gujarat main jitani ladaaiyaan jitate aae hai, unase kahin zyada mushkil yah hoga
 It is not possible for them to revolt in the saffron fort, especially at a time when they are not even the favorite volunteers of the RSS
 un logon ke lihaaj se ve kaaphi bade or modern ho gaye hai jo sirf apni sunate hai
 "the Sangh knows that they can win over the BJP but their dictatorial style will make them bigger than the party and the Sangh," an RSS activist told India Today
 ve vaise hi bijepi ban jaaenge, jaisaa indira gandhi congress ban gai thim
 "or maybe more and more flies will become Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who chose his path by disobeying Nagpur only with the strength of his personality
" phir ant main party or sangh ko apane sabase mashhoor bete ke hisaab se hi chalanaa padegaa, jaisaa ki unhone vaajapeyi ke maamle main kiya tha
 Gadkari has already discounted the credibility of the family
 modi ke kareebi ek bijepi netaa kehete hai, ‘‘modi kii jis tarah kii kaaryastylee he, use dekhte hue ve kabhi bhi gadakari yaa kisi duusare netaa ke neeche kaam nahin karenge
 They may agree to come to Delhi to take charge of the party
 haalanki adarsh sthiti to yahi rahegi ki ve mukhyamantri bane rahen or dilli tabhi aaen jab pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar bana die jaaen
 "well, it is certain that Modi's strength will become indispensable for the Sangh Parivar, if not in 2014, but only in 2019!" He is in charge of the politics of change in Gujarat, but he is not ready to change himself
 ek dashak se zyada ho gaya, ve raja kii tarah raaj karte rahe, or unki javabdehi sirf apane prati thi
 It worked and his stature grew larger than the party
 dikkat yah he ki dilli main ‘main hi main hum’ vaali raajnneeti kaam nahin karti
 Once again, he has the support of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who laid the foundation of 24-carat inclusive leadership
 ab bhi modi or mail-milaap kii raajnneeti kaa sur nahin miltaa
 The more popular they are, the more divisions they create
 nitish kumaar jaise endie ke secular ghatakon ke liye ve pradhanmantri pad ke pratyaashee ke taur par sweekaarya nahin honge
 If the BJP remains in a strong position after 2014 or has made some new friends, then Nitish will not be able to run
 aisa nahin ki unhen doston kii kami he
 Jayalalithaa and Naveen Patnaik, even YSR Congress's Jaganmohan Reddy are not staunch anti-saffronists
 party ke ek puraane netaa kehete hai, ‘‘endie kaa aadhaar failaane ke liye yah bilkul sahi samay he
 Its leaders will need to devote more time to building new alliances and strengthening old relationships
 haalanki ve apni hi jad jamaane main lage hue hai
 "the time is really for Modi who can extend his hand like a leader - provided he understands the importance of softness
" modi ko asal main, saamanjasy baitaane vaala netaa bananaa hoga
 Now they have proved in such a grand way that they are not only able to win again and again but can also digest the victory, so now the time has come for the king to change his clothes
 aakhirkaar modi kii kahani bhartiya raajnneeti ke sabase tikaoo or parivartankaree adhyyon main se ek jo he! ve 2002 se shuru kar ke bhaawanaaon kii siyasat se kaaphi dur nikal aae hai, lekin is raashtra kii yaaddaasht main dangon ke kharonch ab bhi baaki hai
 The guilty are not always the ones to apologize
 dusron ke aparaadh ko apane sir olyde kaa saahas kar paane vaale kisi netaa ke munh se agar aisa shabd phute, to vah jaadu kar saktaa he
 If Delhi has entered their mind, then wipe your heart once before proceeding towards Raisina Hills

 film kaa naam:sarkaar 3diarector:ramgopal vermaster cast:amitabh bachchan, manoj bajpeyi, jaiki shroff, amit saad, yami gautam, ronit roy, rohinee hathangadiavadhi:2 ghanta 12 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga:1
 In 2005, the Hindi film 'sarkar' was inspired by producer director Ram Gopal Varma inspired by the famous Hollywood film 'godfather', which was highly appreciated and then Ram Gopal Varma made 'sarkar Raj' in 2008, which was good at the box office
 Business was done and now almost 9 years later Ramu has made the third film of the same series 'sarkar 3', in which many new characters have been entered and the plot is also kept a little different
 kisi bani he yah film
 
 
 Let's review it
 kahaneeyah kahanesarkaar(amitabh bachchan) or uske ekakshatra samrajya kii taraf aakarshith karti he, kahani main sarkaar kaa pota shivaji nagare (amit saad) vaapasi karata he or sarkaar ke kaam karne ke style par paini najar rakhata he
 Shivaji's girlfriend Anu (yami Gautam) wants to avenge the death of his father from the government and seek Shivaji's help for it
 sarkaar ke kaaphi kareebi gokul (ronit roy) or gorakh (bharat dabholkar) kuch aisa kar jate hai, jisaki vajah se kahani main bahut saare twist terns aate hai, saath hi netaa deshpandey (manoj bajpeyi) or bijnesaman maaikel vaalya (jaiki shroff) kii entry hoti he
 Valya hates the government and its policies, due to which he wants to destroy the government's empire
 kya vah is mansoobey main kaamyaab ho paata he? iskaa pataa aapako theatre tak jaakar hi chal paayegaa
 The story of weak Qian film is quite predictable, which could have been worked on even more
 vahiin bahut saare seens kaaphi draig kiye hue lagate hai, jinhen chota karke film ko or crisp banaaya ja saktaa tha
 The screenplay of the film is very weak, due to which no character has been completed, and there is something missing in every scene
 seens or behatar ho sakate the
 The background score of the film is quite loud, due to which it seems like a lot of noise after a while
 film ke kirdaar ek duusare ko compliment karte hue najar nahin aate hai, jisaki vajah se jabardast samvaad bhi kaaphi fike-fike se jaan padate hai
 Once again Ramgopal Varma is seen taking shots from his different angles and the camera is visible anywhere and anytime, which is quite disturbing
 film main ek vakt ke baad aisa pal bhi aata he, jab aap gambhir seen par bhi hansane lagate ho or khud se sawaal poochhate hai ki aakhirkaar ho kya rahaa he? sikvence kaa conection kaaphi adhuraa he
 Know why you can see the film, the great superstar Amitabh Bachchan has shown the change in the character of the government according to age, on the screen, and has also made a change in his voice, which is quite commendable
 samay ke saath-saath sarkaar kaa pota yani chiku bhi bada hua he jise amit saad ne acha nibhaayaa he
 At the same time, the work of Jackie Shroff, Ronit Roy, Rohini Hathngadi and Yami Gautam is also easy
 manoj bajpeyi ne bhi apni paatr ko umdaa dhang se nibhaayaa he
 The work of all the other artists is great
 to agar aap in actors ke diwane hai, to ek baar jarur dekh sakate hai
 Otherwise, you can wait till you come on TV
 box offissbhi actors kii fees or production ke baad post production or promoshan ko milakar film kaa bajet lagbhag 30 -40 karod bataaya ja rahaa he
 And according to the news, the film is being seen as profitable by combining digital rights, music and satellite
 vaise bahubali 2 pehle se hi bahut saare screens main chal rahi he, jisaki vajah se khabaren hai ki is film ko lagbhag 1500 screens par relies kiya janaa he
 And it is estimated that the film can do business of about 15 crores in the weekend and will be seen mostly in single screens
 'ol iz wel' ke abhinayta abhishek bachchan is film ko apni kabddi team jaipur pink panther ko dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 For this, Abhishek is going to organize a special show
 21 agast ko 'ol iz wel' release hone ja rahi he jiske pramotion main koi kasar nahin chodi ja rahi he

 isse pehle abhishek apni film kii star cast ko jaipur pink panther kaa ek muqabla dikhaa chuke hai

 videsh niti main dharmik masale kaam nahin aate hai
 At the same time, he also said that he would soon go to UAE and meet the foreign minister there and tell about the situation in Jammu and Kashmir
 haalanki, pakistan ko ye bhi yaad rakhana chahie ki UAE pehle hi anuchhed 370 ke masale ko bharat kaa aantarik maamla bataa chukaa he
 In such a situation, Pakistan has already suffered a setback
 aapako bataa den ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bharat or yuai ke bich sambandhon ko behatar banane ke liye vahaan ke sarvocch sammaan ‘order of jaayad’ se nawaaza gaya he

 He went ahead with the plan for strategic alliances for the elections and mocked the opposition parties' pre-election grand alliance efforts as a mega retreat
 unke senapati or bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ke liye sandesh saaf thakripurane asantusht sahyogiyon ko manaao or kuch nae dost banaao
 In the past year, the BJP lost three allies — the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in Andhra Pradesh, the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) in Assam and the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra
 pradhanmantri ne mahasoos kiya ki agar ram mandir ke mudde ko or hawa di jaaegi to janata dal (united) jaise kuch anya sahyogiyon kaa saath bhi chhot saktaa he kyonki isse jedy (you) ke muslim voton par asar padataa he
 However, the relationship with the TDP has reached such a point that it is no longer possible to improve them
 lekin bhaajapa ne agypi ke saath baatcheet shuru kar di he
 The main issue of dispute between the two parties was the Citizenship Amendment Bill 2016, which failed to appear in the Rajya Sabha and has been repealed
 bhaajapa ke liye sabase badi raahat kii khabar 48 loksabhaa siton vaale rajya, maharashtra se ai he jahaan usne shivasena ke saath apni dosti ko phir behaal kar liya he
 In 2014, the two parties jointly won 41 seats, securing 48 percent of the vote
 congress or rashtravaadi congress party (rakanpa) ke bich gathbandhan ho chukaa he, aise main agar bhaajapa akele chunaavon main utarati to yah faisla uske liye vinaashkari hota
 The terms of the agreement also indicate that the BJP was desperate for this alliance
 party ne shivasena kii kai maangon ko sweekaar kar liya, jaise ki nanaar tel rifinary pariyojna ko ratnagiri se baahar sthanantarit karnaa, mumbai main 500 varg foot se kam ke liye sampatti kar maafee or un kisaanon kii krishi rin maafee jinka naam takneekee aadhaar par shaamil nahin ho paaya he
 As per the agreement, BJP will contest 25 Lok Sabha seats and Shiv Sena in 23 seats
 is saal ke ant main hone vaale maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke liye, donon apane chote sahyogiyon ko samyojit karne ke baad bachi hui siten baraabar-baraabar baantengi
 The BJP and Shiv Sena contested the 2014 assembly elections separately and formed a coalition government after the election
 donon kii nai pahal se sanket miltaa he ki donon dalon ne congress-rakanpa gathbandhan se mil rahi chunautiyon ke maddenjar saamanjasypurna kadam uthaae hai
 The congress-ncp alliance secured 35 per cent of the votes in both the 2014 Lok Sabha and Assembly elections
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray announced last year that his party would contest the Lok Sabha elections on its own
 lekin ab apane you-turn ko usne yah kehete hue sahi tehraaya he ki samay kii maang he ki donon dal aapasi matbhedon ko dur karen or vaicharik aadhaar par haath milaayein
 He said that the Shiv Sena needs to come with the BJP to prevent the congress-ncp from taking power
 bhaajapa kii taraf se maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadavis ne donon dalon ke bich kii 'galatchhemiyon' ko gujarey vakt kii baat bataate hue is charchaa ko viraam de diya
 However, analysts say that maintaining the alliance on the ground may have its own challenges
 unhen is baat kii ashanka bhi he ki kya vaaki bhaajapa or shivasena ke netaa or kaaryakarta ek team ke rup main milakar chunaav lard sakate hai
 Shiv Sena Minister Arjun Khotkar has announced in Maharashtra that he will ensure the defeat of BJP state president Raosaheb Danve in Jalna
 shivasena ke netaa bhi bhaajapa saansad kirit somaiya kii mumbai uttar-purv seat se phir se ummidavaari kaa virodh kar rahe hai, kyonki unhone saarvajanik rup se thakare ko 'bandra kaa mafia' kaha tha
 Similarly, BJP activists are deeply angry with Thackeray for constantly questioning the Rafale jet deal
 haalanki, is gathbandhan kaa ek doosraa pahalu bhi he
 In fact, like-minded people from both parties who were playing hostility with each other are now feeling relieved
 bhaajapa ke ek netaa kehete hai, 'na keval donon dalon ke netaa, balki kaaryakarta bhi raahat mahasoos kar rahe honge, kyonki ve haal tak lagaataar sangharsh or tanatani main mubtila the
 'it is also a big benefit for the BJP that it has formed an alliance with All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK)
 39 siton ke saath tamilnadu loksabhaa siton ke lihaaj se dakshin bhartiya rajyon main sabase bada he
 In 2014 the AIADMK won 37 seats and the remaining two seats were won by the BJP and one by Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK)
 is baar eiediemke keval 22-24 siton par chunaav ladgaye ke liye raji ho gai or baaki siten usne bhaajapa or sahyogiyon ke liye chhod di he
 The agreement was finalized on 19 February, in which the PMK has seven Lok Sabha seats and the BJP has five Lok Sabha seats

 In a state where the BJP has a nominal presence, the alliance can emerge as a game-changing alliance, especially if the BJP fails to get a majority in the Lok Sabha on its own
 yah bhaajapa ko dakshin main nai jameen taiyaar karne kaa mauka bhi degaa
 The BJP was keen on contesting in eight seats, but the AIADMK warned that it would benefit their common rival, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)

 Like the AIADMK, the DMK has its eminent leader M
K
 karunanidhi ke nidhan kaa asar padaa he
 In view of this, defeating the aiadmk's grand alliance with the BJP and other parties seems like a dagger for the DMK
 diemke ne ghoshnaa kii he ki vah congress ke saath apana gathbandhan jari rakhegi
 Both DMK and Congress could not win a single seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 do saal baad hue vidhansabha chunaav main, eiediemke ne satta-virdohi lahar ko maat de di or 235 sadasyeey sadan main 135 siton ke saath satta main vaapasi kii
 DMK 88 and Congress could win only eight seats
 congress or diemke, donon ko kul milakar sirf 35 fisadi vot mili the, jabaki eiediemke ne 40 fisadi vot hasil kiye
 But, now the situations are different
 eiediemke ko satta virdohi-lahar kaa to saamana karnaa hi padegaa, saath hi usase nikalakar bani party eememke se bhi use kadi chunauti milane vaali he
 Nevertheless, the inclusion of the PMK and DMDK in the DMK alliance is expected to bolster the party's prospects in northern Tamil Nadu and some districts in western and southern Tamil Nadu
 tamilnadu main sabase badi yaa duusari sabase badi dravid party se haath milaanaa bhaajapa ke liye samay-samay par phydemand sabit hua he
 This proved more profitable in 1998 when the BJP won three seats from Tamil Nadu — from Nilgiri, Tiruchirappalli and Coimbatore — as part of the aiadmk-led Progressive Democratic Front
 1999 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ne diemke ke saath dosti kii or uski sahyogi ke rup main bhaajapa ne chaar siten hasil kii thim
 However, bjp's vote share in the state is low
 2014 main yah bamushkil 5 fisadi thi
 Some analysts argue that the bjp's perceived anti-tamil Nadu image could become a burden for the AIADMK
 ve dhyaan dilaate hai ki 2016 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ke netritv vaale gathbandhan ne ek bhi seat nahin jiti thi or dmdike or piemke kaa vot share bhi ghat gaya he
 Political analyst n

 '' gujarat or himachal pradesh kaa janadesh aa gaya he
 The counting of Gujarat has been completed
 himachal kii do siton par ginati jari he
 However, BJP seems to be forming the government in both the states
 sabhi kii nazren gujarat chunaav par thim, kyonki iskaa asar 2019 tak par asar karegaa
 However, bjp's Armaan was reduced to double digit here
 party ko isse kuch or zyada kii ummid thi
 At the same time, the Congress had nothing to lose
 yahaan milin 77 siten uske liye haar kar bhi jeet jaisi hi he
 Concession of Himachal Pradesh continues
 ‘swing state’ hone ke chalate is baar bijepi ke aane kii ummid thi
 The BJP is going to form the government here with 44 seats
 congress 20 siton par simat gai he
 With the victory in two states, the Congress has been successful in getting 19 states free of Congress by adding another name to its 18 states list, with the BJP moving ahead with the slogan of Mukt Bharat
 bhaajapa ke liye yah apane vijay abhiyaan main ek kadam or aage badhane jaisaa he
 BJP halted on double digit, however after 22 years of rule in Gujarat, bjp's performance seems to be steadily shrinking
 varsh 2002 main 127 siton ke aankade ke baad 2007 main yah aankada 117 par rukaa or 2012 main bhaajapa ko 115 siton par santosh karnaa padaa
 This time the figure stopped at double digit
 party ko 99 siten mili hai
 The sweetness will be less than before
 It is clear from the BJP that the BJP is going to form the government in the state but the sweetness of victory will be less this time than before
 donon rajyon main jeet kii ore bad rahi bhaajapa kii jeet se gadgad adhyaksh amit shah ne party mukhyalay main press conferes main kaha ki is jeet se desh ko teen nasuron se mukti mil gai he
 The country has now got rid of casteism, dynasty and appeasement
 vahiin congress party ke liye yah chunaav khaasaa nirnaayak tha
 It will now be difficult for the party to avoid the new president Rahul Gandhi's foggy electoral campaign and the loss of responsibility of defeat in order to confront Modi directly
 nirnaayak he gujaratgujarat kaa chunaav is baar pradhanmantri narendra modi ke liye bhi khaasaa nirnaayak sabit hua he
 For him, winning Gujarat had become a question of prestige
 gujarat main bhaajapa kii haar se 2019 kaa rasta khaasaa kathin ho jaataa
 But the victory has assured Modi a bit
 haalanki congress party ne jis tarah se is chunaav main prachaar kiya he, usase rahul gandhi ke liye yah haar itani buree nahin rah jaaegi
 He has been able to establish himself as a rival leader and the face of the opposition in this election and it is no small achievement if we look at the current state of the Congress party
 gujarat chunaav ke nateezon main bhale hi bhaajapa ko jeet mil jaae lekin pradhanmantri ke aarthik sudhaar ko ek kathin sandesh de paane main gujarat safal rahaa he
 Surely Narendra Modi will have to think again about his economic reforms because the risk he has seen in Gujarat, he would not like to repeat it in other states
 doosraa bada sandesh yah aa rahaa he ki gujarat ke jin hisson ko bhaajapa apana abhedya durg maanati thi, vahaan par send laga paane main congress safal rahi he or isse rajya main congress apni nai zamin taiyaar kar paane kii sthiti main or bhaajapa ko aane vaale chunaavon main takkar detii nazar aa sakati he
 For the BJP, it is a sweet pebble situation

 His son Vikramaditya Singh has also won
 bhaajapa kii ore se mukhyamantri pad ke chehre prem kumaar dhumal kii haar se yahaan party ko bada jhatka laga he
 The election forecasts predicted the victory of the Bhabhajpa, which turned out to be true

 unka yah daura bharat-china seemaa par sainya jhadap or dalai lamas ke china chhodkar bharat main sharan lene ke baad saamne aayaa tha
 Khrushchev told Mao, chairman of the then ruling Communist Party of China, that he was responsible for the worsening situation in Tibet and tensions along the indo-china border
 bharat-china seemaa vivaad ko lekar khrushchev chini netaa maao se bhid tak gaye the
 He said that you have had a good relationship with India for a long time
 achaanak yah ghatana (bharat-china seemaa par sainya jhadap) hui, jiske chalate nehru khud mushkil main hai
 Due to this, Khrushchev also cut his Beijing tour
 khrushchev ne roosi samachar agency taash ke jariye china or bharat ko aapasi vivaad ko baatcheet ke jariye sulajhane ko bhi kaha tha
 With this attitude of Khrushchev, China began to feel that he was getting away from his partner Mao
 donon netaaon ke bich baatcheet ko 'cold waar international history project of wilson centre' se hasil hua he
 a military skirmish between China and India took place in 1959 when Khrushchev was on his way to America on a peace mission
 khrushchev ne maao se kaha tha ki tibet main aapkaa kabja he
 Therefore, you should be aware of all the plans of the Dalai Lama, including leaving Tibet

 mullah radio ke naam se mashhoor fajalullah tnesaim kaa netaa tha, jise pakistan main bain kar diya gaya he
 Fazlullah was the son-in-law of TNSM founder Sufi Mohammed
 swat par usne kaaphi had tak kabja kar liya tha or vahaan usee kaa kanoon chalata tha
 In the Pakistani army's action that started recently, many of its supporters, including Fazullah, hid here and there
 dilli main bijepi kaa mukhyamantri pad kaa daavedaar koun hoga
 Its fight has now come to the fore
 lekin dilli bijepi main matbhed kii khabaron ke bich party ke dilli chunaav prabharee nitin gadakari ne media par juthi khabaren dikhaane kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha ki netaaon main koi takaraav nahin he
 Nitin Gadkari said, 'vijay Goel left the election committee meeting to come here, but the media said that he left the meeting with anger
 ab main or harshavardhan ji baithak se yahaan aae hai, is par kya aap yah kahenge ki ham bhi naaraaz hai
 Please, do not show false news
 ’ unhone media se kaha, ‘hamaare bare main bhul jaaie, kam se kam apni vishwasaneeyata ke bare main sochie
 However, Goyal later said in a statement that he is not a member of this committee of the party
 aise main baithak se vaak out yaa phir istife kii baat aadharahin he
 On the other hand, due to the uproar of the supporters of both the leaders at the meeting place, the party has currently deferred the candidate's announcement, according to party sources, the candidate for the post of CM of Delhi is to be decided this week
 lekin party goyal ko manaane ke liye samuhik netritv main bhi chunaav ladane kaa faisla kar sakati he
 Ultimately, that decision was taken, which a large section of the Congress had been waiting for a long time
 priyanka wadra ko congress ne party kaa mahasachiv banaakar bada daanv khel diya he
 Along with this, he has been given the charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh in view of Lok Sabha elections 2019
 ab is baat kii atkal tej ho gai he ki priyanka gandhi wadra apni maa yani sonia gandhi kii sansadeey seat raibareli se loksabhaa kaa chunaav bhi lard sakati hai
 This speculation gained momentum on Wednesday when he was made the General Secretary of the Congress
 sonia gandhi ko 23 janvari ko raibareli ke daure par janaa tha, lekin aakhri vakt main yah daura radd kar diya gaya
 Because of this too, the speculation of Priyanka Gandhi contesting from here once again intensified
 raibareli se priyanka ke chunaav ladane kii charchaa raibareli main lambey samay se ho rahi he
 Recently this discussion was intensified when Priyanka Vadra's consent was sought in the appointment of 8 Block Presidents of Rae Bareli
 yahi nahin, congress kii purv adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke swasthya ke chalate raibareli main unki sakriyata kam hui he
 In view of this, Priyanka has been speculating to contest from Rae Bareli for some time
 raibareli or uske pados main maujuud amethi seat nehru- gandhi parivaar kaa 'garh' maani jaati rahi he
 These two areas are not new to Priyanka Gandhi
 ve 1999 se kai loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaavon main in donon siton par congress kii ore se prachaar karti rahi hai
 Significantly, Sonia Gandhi's health has deteriorated over the years
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad to raibareli main sonia gandhi kii sakriyata bahut kam ho gai
 In such a situation, Priyanka Vadra is handling the responsibility of campaigning the party in Rae Bareli
 priyanka raibareli main congress ke kaaryakartaaon se lagaataar sampark main rahati hai
 She also meets Rae Bareli activists in Delhi
 uttar pradesh main 2017 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main priyanka wadra bahut sakriy thim
 His activism can be gauged from the fact that the Congress in-charge of UP, Ghulam Nabi Azad, had named Priyanka Vadra from the public platform to the commander-in-chief
 2017 main congress or sapa ke gathbandhan main bhi priyanka kaa ahm role mana jaataa he
 It is said that Priyanka talked to Akhilesh Yadav's wife Dimple Yadav and prepared the ground for an alliance between the two parties
 yahaan is baat kaa zikr dilachasp hoga ki prayagraj main gaahe-bagaahe congress ke kaaryakarta poster lagaakar priyanka ko sakriy raajnneeti main laane kii maang karte rahe hai
 a section of the party has seen Priyanka Vadra's image of her grandmother Indira Gandhi

 isse pehle somvaar ko loksabhaa spikar mira kumaar or rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar shivashankar menon bhi is pratinidhimandal se nahin mili the

" 'pratinidhimandal main america congress ke sadsy george holding (republican-north carolina), pet olsan (republican-texas), david shwikurt (republican-arijona), robert woodal (republican-arijona) or madalin boradalo (democrate-guam) shaamil the

 He was given a one-year extension just a week ago
 jis property ko hathiyaane ke aarope lage hai, use haal hi main khan or unki patni gulasharin ne gupakaar road par kharida he
 The bungalows of Gupakar Road are considered status symbols
 is ilaake main kaaphi security rahati he or yahaan amir or taqatvar hastiyon ke alaava viviipi hi rahete hai
 Munir Khan is going to live after retirement in the property which has been alleged
 munir khan ne india today ko bataaya ki yah jameen karodon rupee kii he or vah ab tak 97 lakh rupee is 'privet property' ke liye de chuke hai
 But a neighbor of Gupkar Road in Munir alleged that the land was a custodial land
 sanyog se munir khan ke bhai bashir ahamed khan rajya ke sheersh iees adhikari hai or un par gulmarg main kai prabhaavshaalee logon ko gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se jameen dene kaa aarope he
 But despite these controversies, the Narendra Modi government at the Center gave an extension of one year each to both brothers
 munir khan ne india today se kaha, 'yah deal puri tarah se vaid he
 Khan said that he sold his ancestral land in Jammu to buy property here
 khan ne kaha ki unhone yah sampatti kharidne se pehle kaaphi jaanch-padtaal kii or jab paaya ki is par koi vivaad nahin he, tab yah sampatti kharidi
 He further added, "we applied for the title and demarcation through a special committee and the Custodian agreed and signed the report
 'khan ne kaha, 'aatankiyon ke khilaaf oparation ke kaaran meri or mere parivaar kii jindagi khatre main he
 That is why i have planned to live in the safest area of srinagar
 ' unke kareebi sutron ne kaha, ekstansion milane ke baad yah unki chhavi ko kharaab karne kii sajeesh he
 At the same time, his upcoming neighbor Mir has sent a letter to the Rammunshi Bagh police to stop 'illegal construction'
 mir kaa daawa he ki yah castodian property he
 According to the Jammu and Kashmir government, custodian land cannot be bought or sold
 mir ke kareebi sutron ne bataaya, unka maananaa he ki maamle main 'jod-tod' karne kii sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In it, the Custodian property was converted into a private property, so that Munir Khan could do the deal
 chunki police mahakama khan ke under he isliye vah jaanate hai ki vah behad shaktishaalee lobby se takkar le rahe hai
 Mir told India Today that he wanted to see a map of that piece of land to find out whether the land was custodian or private
 deal ko kanoonee dikhaane ke liye munir khan ne police stesan main dastavej pesh kiye hai
 Now Mir is planning to send a letter to the police station and the revenue department as well

 is kamity main rajasav vibhaag, castodian property kashmir, dephence estate or kaint board badami baag ke pratinidhi shaamil the
 The committee said that this dispute is about the property of Afandi, which has been declared an agent of enemies by bringing an ordinance
 rajasav vibhaag ke sahaayak ayukta ke khaton se pataa chalata he ki castodian ne privet properties ke saath jameen exange kara lee thi
 Other allegations are that all the papers were processed in a single day and possession was given despite the objections of the Cantt Board on the baname
 lekin kaint board kii aapattiyon ko darkinar kar diya gaya kyonki raksha adhikariyon kii raay alag di
 This land was neither occupied before 1946 nor after the forces
 records dikhaate hai ki yah jameen gulasharin (khan kii patni) ke naam par he
 So there is no basis to challenge it

 Eminent thinker and former BJP leader KN Govindacharya, who was once active in the Naxalite movement, believes that today's Naxalite movement has gone astray and that the Naxalites can never succeed on the strength of violence to achieve their objective and neither can the government gun

 Govindacharya has admitted that he has also been involved in police encounters many times while being associated with the Naxalite movement
 lekin govindacharya kaa saaf taur par maananaa he ki naksal andolan ko maovadi na to hinsa ke bal par safal bana sakate hai or na hi sarkaar inhen bandook ke bal par apane kaabo main kar sakati he
 He admitted that there has been a distraction in the objective of the Naxalites and that their way of persuading the government has also changed
 unhone kaha ki ab hinsa is andolan kaa aadhaar banataa ja rahaa he lekin iske liye unhone sarkaar kii vifal nitiyon ko jimmedaar mana
 Govindacharya said that while there has been a decrease in trust and dialogue between the government and the Maoists, the scope of political opportunism has also spread widely

 Govindacharya made it clear that the Maoists cannot succeed in their cause on the strength of political ambition and gunpowder, but if the government has to solve this problem then it will also have to give up hope of success by using force

 bihar vidhansabha chunaav ke liye jediu ne diya nayaa sloganhordings par likhaa 'kyun kare vichaar, thike to he nitish kumaar'2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main slogan tha 'bihar main bahaar he'bihar vidhansabha chunaav kii taiyaari abhi se janata dal (united) ne shuru kar di he
 JDU has released the slogan of 'why should you consider, why don't you think, Nitish Kumar', for the upcoming election in Bihar
 jediu is naare ke jariye yah sandesh dena chaahati he ki nitish kumaar kaa koi doosraa vikalp nahin he
 In such a situation why should be considered for someone else
 jediu kaa maananaa he ki bihar main nitish kumaar kaa koi vikalp nahi hai
 In such a situation, which is discussed in the local colloquial language on the village chaupals, in the end it emerges in front of us - 'why do you think, it's okay, Nitish Kumar 
 ' is naare ko jediu ke rashtriya sachiv upendra kumaar singh ne diya he, jise party karyaalay ke baahar lagaaya gaya he
 Let us tell you that in the 2015 assembly elections of Bihar, JDU gave the slogan of 'bihar is out, Nitishe Kumar hai'
 jediu kaa yah naaraa bihar main khub chalaa tha
 It was coined by political strategist Prashant Kishore
 nitish kumaar us samay mahagathbandhan kaa cheharaa the
 RJD and Congress were allies of JDU in Bihar
 argedy ne saadhaa nishananithish kumaar ab endie ke sahyogi dal hai
 That is why RJD is busy mocking the new slogan of JDU
 halaki vah nitish kumaar ke vikalp kii baat to nahin karti lekin yah kahati he ki bihar main eke-47 kii bahaar he jail main janmdin party gulzaar he phir bhi kyun kare vichaar
 Well, that is not very good
 argedy ke vidhayak or pravaktaa bhai virendra kaa kahana he ki jediu ne nitish kumaar ko is slogan ke jariye ek kadam peeche hi kar diya he
 This is a hastily given slogan, in a very cold manner that Nitish Kumar is right
 unhone kaha ki bihar main jo haalat he, jis tareeke se kanoon vyavastha kaa sawaal paidaa ho rahaa he
 It can be said exactly how jis rajya main eke 47 kii bahaar ho, jahaan jail main kaidi berth-de party manaa rahen ho
 In Sitamarhi, a woman councilor is being threatened over the phone by the leader of the ruling party
 vahaan kaise thik ho saktaa he
 At the same time, JDU feels that Nitish Kumar is running the government in Bihar and no one else is visible
 aise main ye bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki jediu bhi kahin nitish kumaar ko under stemate to nahin kar rahi he
 However, the slogan given in the last assembly election was quite well known that 'bihar has an outside Nitish Kumar
 ' bihar main jab bhi koi ghatana hoti he to soshal media par log tanj ke taur likhte he ki 'bihar main bahaar he
 'we will write well now halaki jediu kaa apana tark he
 He feels that this slogan is written in the common Bihari language
 isiilie kaaphi lokapriy bhi hoga
 However, JDU has thrown its dice for next year's assembly elections in Bihar
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki unke virdohi is naare kii kaat main kya chalate hai? a journalist was killed in a police shootout on Sunday, the second day of an indefinite strike by a film body demanding the arrest of a Naga militant over alleged molestation of an actress

 The protesters set the police vehicle on fire and blocked public and security vehicles
 nanaao singh ke seene main goli lagi or ek aspataal main usne dam tod diya
 As news of his death spread, violence spread in many parts of the Manipur Valley region, especially in Imphal East and Imphal West districts
 jab pradarshnakariyon ne saare pramukh raste band kar die or jab police ne unhen hataane kii koshish kii to unhone patharav kiya
 They were demanding the arrest of Livingstone Anal, a militant of the National Socialist Council of nagaland-issac Muivah faction (NSCN-IM), for alleged molestation with actress Mamoko
 ullekhneey he ki 18 disambar ko chandel jile main abhinetri momoko ek sangeet kaarykram kaa sanchaalan kar rahi thim, usee dauraan anal ne kathith rup se unke saath chhedchhad kiya tha
 When the two actors tried to save the actress, Anal opened fire on her

 The state Home Minister went to the Gakhungan Regional Institute of Medical Sciences and Hospital and mourned Singh's death
 unhone pradarshnakariyon se shanti banaae rakhane kii evam prashasan ko sthiti saamaanya banane main sahyog karne kii apil kii
 Nanao Singh died in this hospital
 baad main saikadon patrkaar aspataal pahunche
 Singh's body was then taken to the Manipur Press Club
 isse pehle imphal pashchimi jile main police ne pradarshnakariyon ko teetar bitar karne ke liye aansu gas ke gole daage
 The protesters were pelting stones at police vehicles

 Gaikhangam said that Chief Minister o Ibobi Singh is in Delhi to meet Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and discuss with him on the arrest of Anal as peace talks have been going on with the government since the NSCN IM signed a ceasefire agreement 14 years ago
