 ’ kohli ne bharat ko pachhaadne kaa shrey australia ko dete hue kaha ki ballebaaj acha pradarshan karne main naakaam rahe, visheshkar duusari pari main

 bharat ne test team main chotil prithvi shaw kii jagah mayank agarwal ko shaamil kiya he, lekin kohli ne kaha ki vah salaami ballebaajon kaa samarthan karenge
 Kohli said, 'we have not announced that we will go with the new opening pair

 Rejecting the allegation of having a double stance on the Congress in this matter, Singhvi said that the BJP is adopting such a stand

 When Singhvi was asked why the Congress was opposing it yesterday when former Finance Minister p Chidambaram welcomed the bill, he said that supporting it does not mean that every comma, full stop is supported
 singhvi ne kaha ki vam dal iske puri tarah khilaaf hai lekin congress kaa rakh aisa nahin he

 Take, for example, public support for the controversial decision of demonetisation made by him last November
 is faisle ne desh ke vittiya tantra ko jabardast tareeke se asantulit kar daalaa, aam aadmi ko bahut dard diya or iske phaayde par ab bhi muhar lagani baaki he
 In his Independence Day address, Modi mentioned that due to demonetisation, the benami money of three lakh crore rupees has come into the banking system
 ab tak haalanki arabiai iskaa koi laagat-laabh vishleshan saamne nahin rakh sakaa he

5 million according to the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, ie CMIE) and the country's GDP has declined (0 on it
 5 fisadi kii aam sahmati he)
 Yet, as the country's mood survey shows, the majority of the people involved have called the demonetisation move an attack on black money and counted the corruption-free government as Modi's biggest achievement so far

 The wind of the UPA government led by Manmohan Singh was lost in the second term because it had proved corrupt in the public perception
 rashtramandal khelon se lekar koyala ghotaalaa yaa 2ji doorsanchaar spectrum aavanton main rajkosh ko hue baari nuksaan jaise silsilewar ghotaalon ne logon ko bhrashtachar ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang karne ko majaboor kar diya tha
 People not only wanted that there should be someone who could run the country, but also a leader who could clean the corrupt and immoral system of government
 modi isi vaade par savaar hokar satta main aae the
 After three years in power, they have decided to take all measures to attack the roots of corruption and black money
 kahin zyada ahm yah he ki ve matadaataaon tak yah baat pahunchaa paane main kaamyaab rahe hai ki ve kyon kar rahe hai
 That is why during the peak period of demonetisation, when people were standing in front of banks in surly queues to withdraw their own money, Modi was expressing sorrow but was repeatedly reminding people why they are doing this
 unhone bharosa dilaayaa ki notebandi samta paidaa karne vaala kadam he or jo log galat tareeke se paise banaae the, ab unki baari he
 He made the government realize that the government is working towards a clean government only on the demand of the people and taking strict action against those who illegally store money
 yahaan tak ki unki sarkaar kaa doosraa bada or ahm sudhaar jiesti bhi akele is rup main nahin pesh kiya gaya, jo daam kam karke upabhoktaaon kii madad karegaa, balki kar chori or rishwatakhori ko kam karne main madad karegaa
 In all these exercises, Modi was focused on "why", not "what" and "how"
 iske sahare ve apni kahani logon ko samajha paane main kaamyaab rahe
 There are some other qualities which Modi has displayed and due to which his image has reached tremendous heights
 pradhanmantri ko ab aazaadee ke baad ke sabase achche netaa ke rup main darja mil chukaa he
 He has surpassed Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the mood survey of the latest country
 unki sarkaar kaa haal yah he ki agar chunaav aaj ho gaye to endie 349 siten jeetne main kaamyaab hoga jo janvari, 2017 main hue pichley desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan ke 360 se thodaa kam he
 The UPA is far behind with 75 seats while other opposition parties will barely get 119 seats
 mahatvapurn yah bhi he ki lagaataar duusare desh kaa mizaaj tisare surveykshan main yah baat saamne ai he ki bhaajapa akele dam par bahumat paa sakati he
 In the current survey, it is estimated to get 298 seats
 notebandi se aarthik vruddhi main ai giravat ke baavjood agar bhaajapa or modi apane dam par khadey rah paane main aaj sakasham hai, to yah tathy is baat kii ore sanket karata he ki sattadhari dal 2019 main satta main vaapasi main paryaapt sakasham he, basharte maujuuda rujhaan jari rahe
 These results are before the Chief Minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar broke away from the grand alliance and returned to the NDA
 agar unki party jedy(you) gathbandhan main shaamil ho jaati he to maujuuda paridrishy main endie kaa aankada 400 siton ko paar kar ja saktaa he
 To understand Modi, he once again resorts to Sinek, who counts 10 sources of tremendous success: break the rules, train your mind, be patient, be accountable, do more than your ability, hold the pegs, speak in the end , Be authentic, explore your mindset and start with why
 is suchi ko jaanchie or aap paaenge ki modi har sutara par khare utarate hai
 They have consistently broken the rules, be it surgical strikes or demonetisation
 pichley teen saal main unhone lagaataar apane pratidwandviyon ko or khud ko bhi apane kaamon se peeche chhod diya he
 They take accountability for their every move
 cabinet kii baithkon main ve apane sahyogiye kii sunate hai or ant main bolte hai
 And whenever speaking, it has clarity, passion, and authenticity that always underlines the broader vision
 shaayad yahi kaaran he ki desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan main 63 fisadi log unke pradarshan ko achche se lekar shandaar tak bataa rahe hai or keval 12 fisadi log ise kharaab or badtar kah rahe hai
 Despite this, Sinek's rules do not show how India is trapped in Modi's affair even after three years
 ek kaaran yah he ki modi ko majboot or nirnaayak netaa ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he, jo aadhunik bharat ke nazariye ko saakaar karne ko icchhuk he jisase vah logon ko prerit karnaa chahta he
 In doing so, he has set a personal example and ensured that merit is preferred in the appointment of central bureaucrats
 ve vyaavhaarik prashaasak hai or apane kaaryakramon kii khud nigaraanee karte hai tathaa apane mantriyon or afasaron se unki pragati ke sambandh main power point prastutiyaan mangavate hai
 His cabinet colleagues say that the Prime Minister has a tremendous memory, is a good listener and keeps an eye on fine details
 jaisaa ki ek sahyogi kehete hai, ''ve vichaaron ko gadhe jane ke charan se lekar aakhyaan banane or lagu hone ke charan tak khud dekhte hai
 "modi has exploited technology to enable governance and simplify and speed up government processes
 apane sandesh ko logon tak pahunchane ke liye unhone chaalu jumalon or kahawaton kaa sahaara liya he
 On the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the "quit India" movement in Parliament, Modi said that the famous slogan "do or die" will be "changed and will be taxed"
 swatantraaa diwas ke sambodhan main logon ko suzav diya he, ve ''chalata he" vaala najariya choden or ''badal sakate hai" vaali drushti ko apanaaen
 When it comes to working style, the results of the country's mood survey look quite interesting and contradictory
 bina bhay ke bade jokhim lene waalon kii suchi main ve sabase upar hai (24 fisadi log) lekin surveykshan kaa ek nateeja unhen kadi chetavanee bhi de rahaa he
 There are an equal number of people who believe that Modi only talks and does nothing
 ishaara is ore he ki unhone jo tamaam yojanaayen shuru kii hai, teen saal baad un par kuch karte hue dikhaai bhi dena ab shuru karen
 There is a section which believes that the Prime Minister is sect-narrow and anti-minority
 gorakshakon lanpaton ne kanoon haath main lekar unki is chhavi ko or chamkaaya he
 Such elements have to be treated harshly
 modi ne haal hi main unke dwaara kii gai hinsa ke khilaaf ek kadaa sandesh diya tha
 In the Independence Day address also talked about this openly
 surveykshan main shaamil log unki garib-samarthak chhavi ko sweekaar karte hai lekin kisaanon kii yojanaon ke sambandh main log unhen halke main lete hai or kehete hai ki ye yojanaayen naakaafi hai
 This survey has produced some other indications which are warning signs for the Prime Minister
 sabase ahm chetavanee rojgaar ke morche par aa rahi he, jahaan log is baat se ngkshachatit hai ki pichley desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan ke baad se naukariyon kaa sankat badha he (dekhen arthvyavastha par saath kii story)
 It is not that the Modi government did absolutely nothing
 unka jor infrastracchar par sarkari vyay badhaane par rahaa he, khaskar shram saghan sadakon or awaas kshetra main unhone kaaphi bal diya he
 They can all benefit from this in the coming year
 iske alaava unhone vikaas kii kai or yojanaayen shuru kii hai
 The Prime Minister has reversed the whole story by calling for unemployed youth to seek employment instead of seeking employment
 unka kahana he ki swarozgaar yojanaon kaa ve puraa dohan karen jo unki sarkaar ne shuru kii hai
 Prime Minister Modi does not hesitate to spread his legs, no matter how small the sheet
 unhone ek nayaa lakshya pakad liya he
 He has articulated the vision of "new India" which is to be achieved by 2022 - when India will complete 75 years of its independence
 swatantraaa diwas ke apane bhaashan main unhone kaha, ''main team india kaa aahvaan karata hum ki vah 2022 tak new india banane ke liye daud lagaae
 By that time the poor would have concrete paved houses
 kisaanon kii aay doguna ho chuki hogi
 The youth and women will have plenty of prosperity opportunities
 vah ek svachh bharat hona chahie
 India free from casteism, communalism, corruption and nepotism
 " aisa kahkar modi ne kaaphi sookshm tareeke se matadaataaon tak sandesh de diya he ki unki nigaah 2019 ke chunaav par nahin he jab unhen dobaaraa maidan main utarana hoga
 Instead, he has presented a roadmap of 2022, on the lines of Martin Luther King, which gives people a reason to bring him back to power
 prabandhan ke mahaarathiyon ko modi se sabak lenaa chahie

 goswami ne na sirf hinsa ke mudde ko uthaane ke liye apni kalam ko ek majboot hathiyaar banaaya balki pratibandhit ulpha ko baatcheet kii mej par laane kii pahal bhi kii
 Indira Goswami, who prefers to write under the surname Mamoni Resom Goswami, wrote a number of novel short stories and scholarly articles that show the pain of people from different backgrounds whose sufferings have deprived them of the basic dignity and respect they deserve
 unhone pratibandhit ulpha ko aage kii vaarta ke liye taiyaar karne or 2003 main pipulas kansaltative group kii sthapana tathaa unhen salaahkaar ke rup main niyukt karne kii pahal bhi kii
 Goswami's efforts may not have yielded immediate results, but they certainly paved the way for ongoing talks between ULFA leaders and the government
 ‘mamoni bidu’ ke naam se prasiddh goswami kaa janm 14 navambar 1942 ko ek paaramparik vaishnav parivaar main hua tha jo dakshini kamrup ke amaranga main ek ‘satr’ :math: kaa maalik tha
 The surroundings of the monastery both its unchanged religious principles and the evils prevailing in the society had a profound effect on the mind of young Indira Goswami, which she later expressed in her compositions, especially her novel 'datal Hatir Une Khova Hovdah'

 He said, 'this is very clear in the soul of the Constitution, which prevents this kind of feeling from being expressed

 landan se 251 yatriyon ko lekar kahiraa ja rahe mistra ke ek vimaan main bam hone kii soochna milane ke baad use apaat sthiti main athens hawaii adde par utaara gaya

 janata darbar main mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat ko do took jawaab dene vaali teacher uttara bahuguna ko nilambit karke upashiksha adhikari karyaalay naugaanv main bhej diya gaya he
 Initial District Education Officer KS Chauhan said in the suspension order that he had participated in the Janata Darbar of the Chief Minister without a departmental officer and there was indecency, which is a violation of the rules of Employee Ethics Service
 lekin niyamon ke ulanghan kaa ulaahna dene vaale bade adhikari or khud mukhyamantri shaayad sahi baton se avgat hi nahin hai, agar aisa hota to shaayad 57 varsh kii ek vidhwaa teacher ko apane adhikariyon ko chhodkar sidhe janata darbar main nahin aana padataa
 After all, from where did she get so much courage that she sat directly with the Chief Minister in this way
 25 saal se system se lard rahi thi teachermukhyamantri ji ne bhale hi na sochaa ho, lekin ajtak kii team ne sachai kii tah tak ja sahi kaarnon kii padtaal kii to pataa chalaa ki yah teacher pichley 25 saal se system se lard rahi thi, lekin koi pahunch na hone ke kaaran na isaki kisi ne suni or na hi koi kaarywahi kii
 After all, when the action took place in the Chief Minister's court, such a dangerous action took place that everyone lost consciousness
 mukhiya trivendra singh ravat ne mahila shikshika ko nilambit karne or giraftaar karne kaa aadesh diya
 Perhaps it is called the chief's public court
 ye hai sachai bataane vaale aankadeuttara pant bahuguna kii pehali niyukti 1993 main rajkeey praathmik vidhyalay bhadrasu mori uttarkashi ke durgam vidhyalay main hui thi
 The following year he was transferred to Dhuniara Primary School in Chinyalisaur in Uttarkashi
 jo sadak se 5-6 kimi
 Is set on a steep climb
 varsh 1994 se saat-aath saal tak vah jagadogaanv dugulagad main tainaat raheen or varsh 2003 se 2015 tak yahaan tainaat rahane ke baad unhen uttarkashi ke naugaanv main jestwari praathmik vidhyalay main sthanantarit kar diya gaya
 After the husband's death in 2015, the teacher was constantly trying for a Dehradun transfer with children, but the then Chief Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, Vijay Bahuguna, Harish Rawat and Trivinder Singh Rawat did not listen to her
 siem ne diya tha transfar kaa aashwaasanhar darbar main hi naakaam rahane valimahila shikshikaitani laachaar ho chuki thi ki apane aapako trivendra singh ravat ke saamne roak nahin pai or itani badi sazaa paa baithi
 The teacher also met Trivendra Singh Rawat a few days ago
 siem ravat ne unhen transfar karne kaa aashwaasan bhi diya tha lekin aisa hua nahin
 This truth came out of the revelation in the case of RTI, which is an immense contribution of RTI in bringing it to the public
 artiai main uplabdh dastavejon ke anusaarmukhyamantri trivendra singh rawatki patni sunita ravat apni pratham niyukti se lekar ab tak sugam main hi tainaat hai
 Sunita Rawat was first appointed on 24 March 1992 in primary school Kafaldi Sweat Pauri Garhwal
 yah ek sugam vidhyalay he
 She stayed in primary school Mendoli Pauri Garhwal for 16 years from 16 / 7 / 1992 and then on 27 / 8 / 1996, she was transferred to primary school Ajabpur Kalan, never seen her face outside
 24 / 5 / 2008 ko unki padonnati purv madhyamik vidhyalay ajabpur kalam main hi hui or tab se unki posting yahi he
 AN RTI query reveals that # uttarakhandcm TS Rawat's wife Sunita Rawat has been posted in a school in Dehradun's Ajabpur Kalan since 1996 even after she received promotion in 2008
 CM had ordered suspension of a teacher after she argued with him in Janta Darbar y'day over her transfer

 com / yytfmnpxlh — ANI (@ANI) June 29, 2018 Why different rules for two teachers? In the RTI reply, Public Information Officer and Education Officer Monika Bam said that apart from the appointment letter of Sunita Rawat
 Certificates are not available with them
 vidhyalay raipur block ke dehradun main sthit he
 If these two teachers are compared then one teacher has been in inaccessible area of uttarkashi since 1993, and was widowed in the year 2015, while the other teacher has been continuously self-explanatory since her posting in 1992 and same place in Dehradun since 1996

 The Congress on Monday expressed its unhappiness over the system of granting the Chief Minister status to four leaders in Meghalaya, calling it "relatively unusual" but at the same time citing political instability in the state as it attempted to defend the move
 
 party pravaktaa abhishek manu singhvi ne yahaan samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki meghalaya main sirf ek mukhyamantri he or samvidhan ke mutabik sirf ek mukhyamantri hi ho saktaa he
 Others have only been given the status of Chief Minister and it is not under their jurisdiction to take decisions as Chief Minister
 karypalika ke nirnay kaa adhikaar sirf mukhyamantri ko hi he
 Singhvi said, "I agree that this is relatively unusual
" lekin yah ek chota sa rajya he or vahaan raajnneetik asthirataa rahi he
 He defended the Congress-led Meghalaya government's decision to call it a political decision and said that many states have deputy chief ministers and corporations and Bodo presidents are given the status of cabinet ministers
 yah puche jane par ki kya chote se rajya main chaar mukhyamantrayon ke kaaran sarkari khajaane par anaavashyak boj nahin padegaa or is tarah yah sarkari dhan kaa durupyog nahin he, singhvi ne kaha ‘‘main nahin samajhataa ki yah koi durupyog he

 Dhoni's special 'mantra' for Team India is like prayers for the entire country with the team, but there is a goodluck that will make the team a firm champion

 Yes, under the captaincy of Dhoni, the Indian cricket team has so far won two World Cups, one T20 and the other in odis
 in donon hi toornament main bharat ne lig stage main ek taai match khelaa he
 In the T20 World Cup 2007, Pakistan clashed with their arch-rivals Pakistan in the match-group stage

 a total of 676 runs were scored in this match played at Chinnaswamy Stadium, but no team was a winner
 darasal, bharat ne pehle ballebaaji karte hue nirdhaarit 50 over main 338 ran banaae
 In response, the England team could only manage 338 runs for 8 wickets in the scheduled overs
 aisa nahin he ki dhoni ke liye taai match kaa gudlak sirf world cap jaise toornament tak simit rahaa he

 Jyotiraditya Scindia looked slightly lost in the presence of people in the Congress office in Bhopal during the formal announcement of the Chief Minister's post

 On the question of who will become the Chief Minister, there was a round of marathon meetings at the house of Rahul Gandhi throughout the day on Thursday
 madhya pradesh congress ke adhyaksh, gandhi parivaar ke kareebi maane jane vaale kamalnath or jyotiraditya mukhyamantri pad ke liye daavedaar the
 The cm's name was announced late in the night after a day of brainstorming and once again the Scindia family missed out on becoming the head of the state
 kamalnath ke naam par muhar lagi jabaki jyotiraditya ko apane kadam peeche khinchne pade
 This is not the first time that the Chief Minister's chair in Madhya Pradesh has slipped from the Scindia family
 jyotiraditya ke pita madhavrao sindhiya 1993 ke rajya vidhansabha chunaavon ke baad congress ko mili jeet ke baad is baat ko lekar aashwast the ki unhen hi siem banaaya jayega
 But the Chief Minister's chair was given to a person whom nobody expected

 baithak main subhash ke naam par sahmati na banate dekh arjuna singh ne apni haar maan lee or bhaashan khatm kar baahar chale gaye
 During this, Madhav Rao Scindia was waiting for a call with a helicopter in Delhi

 Union Minister Giriraj Singh, who has always been at the center of discussion due to his provocative and communal speeches, has taken his old attitude again
 begusarai se NDA ke ummidavaar giriraaj singh ne party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke saamne manch se muslim samudaay ke logon ko chetavanee di he ki agar kabr ke liye teen haath jagah chahie to is desh main vandemataram gaanaa hoga or bharat mata kii jai kahana hoga
 Now listen to Union Minister Giriraj Singh who has told the people of Muslim community on the stage of Begusarai in front of his national president Amit Sah that if the tomb needs three inches of land, then you have to say Vande Mataram's song and Bharat Mata ki Jai
 anyathaa desh tumhen kabhi maaf nahin karegi 
 pic
 twitter
 com / zrkhnkh5au According to Giriraj, if you are not able to do this, the country will never forgive you
 giriraaj singh ne buudhvaar ko party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke kaarykram main apane bhaashan ke dauraan anya baton kii charchaa karne ke alaava kaha ki kuch log bihar kii dharti ko raktranjit karnaa chaahate hai, sampradayik aag failaana chaah rahe hai, lekin BJP jab tak he na bihar main aisa hoga or na begusarai kii dharti par ve aisa hone denge
 After that Giriraj while referring to a so-called statement of Abdul Bari Siddiqui candidate from Darbhanga of Rashtriya Janata Dal said that ‘RJD candidate says in Darbhanga that Vande Mataram i will not speak
 begusarai main bhi kuch log aakar bade bhai kaa kurtaa or chote bhai kaa pyjama pahanakar bhraman kar rahe hai
 But i want to tell them that those who cannot sing Vande Mataram, who cannot bow down to the motherland of India, remember that o Giriraj's maternal grandfather died on the banks of the Ganges in Simaria Ghat, a grave on the same land
 Not made but you need three hands
 tum aisa nahin kar paaoge to desh tumhen kabhi maaf nahin karegaa
 After this, Giriraj finished his speech but certainly this part of the speech was shocking
 haalanki jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki giriraaj is baar jab nitish kumaar ke saath manch par hote hai tab ve sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas or sampradayik sadbhaav kaayam rakhane kii baaten karte hai lekin jab ve apane manch par or apni party ke varisht netaaon ke saamne bol rahe hote hai to muslim samudaay ke logon ko nishane par rakhane se nahin chookte
 The second reason for this is also being told that this time due to the triangular competition in Begusarai, he has got the idea or is part of his thoughtful strategy that unless the communal polarization is there then the path of his victory will be easy Will not done
 isliye unhone jaanboojhkar vande maataram, bharat mata kii jai or kabristaan or kabr ke liye jameen kaa mudda chhedaa he

 Saree is a traditional dress
 par acchhee baat ye he ki paramparaagat hone ke baavjood ise lekar samay-samay par kai prayog kiye jate rahe hai or yahi vajah he ki ye aisi dress he jiskaa fishan kabhi purana nahin hota
 Whether she is an older woman or a teen-age girl, everyone likes to wear saris on special occasions
 par sari pahananaa bhi ek kala he
 The sari looks as beautiful as it was tied properly
 bhale hi aapaki sari bahut mahangi ho auradekhane main khubasurat ho lekin agar wo sahi se nahin baandhi gai he to uski khubsuuratikhilkar nahin aegi
 In such a situation, it is important that you do not make the mistakes that most women do while wearing a saree
 1
 Your saree should be according to the season, time and occasion
 sari ke chayan ke saath hi uskaa blouse bhi sthiti ke anusaar hi ho to, behatar hoga
 2
 sari kaa blouse uski khubsuurati badha bhi saktaa he or gata bhi saktaa he
 In such a situation, it is important that you always wear a matching blouse
 vaise aajkal contrast kaa bhi chalan he
 3
 sari baandhte samay is baat kaa vishesh dhyaan den ki sari kaa anchal ek baraabar aae
 High-low plate can ruin the look of the sari
 4
 Choose the color of saree according to your skin
 jaruri nahin ki jo rang or dizin dusron par fabate hai wo aap par bhi khubasuratlagen
 So try to avoid being seen
 5
 The color of your petticoat should match the color of your saree
 kai baar mahilaayein kisi ek rang kii sari ke saath duusare rang kaa peticot pahan leti hai
 This adds to the beauty of the sari

 Vasundhara Raje, who succeeded in securing the chair of Rajasthan BJP President by pressurizing the BJP high command, is now in the role of chief strategist
 unhen chunavi akhaade main congress ko parajeet kar bijepi ko jeet kaa sehara pehanaanaa he, isliye ve ‘ekajute bhaajapa, congress laapata’ ke udghaghosh ke saath maidan main utar padi hai
 Speaking to Assistant Editor Rohit Parihar, he said that the days of Ashok Gehlot's chief minister are now over
 pesh hai unase baatcheet ke ansh:party main ghanashyam tiwadi jaise kai netaa aapke khilaaf hai, aise main kya aap nai jimmedaari thik se nibhaa paaengi?kaaryakartaaon ke bina koi bhi party thik waisi hi ho jaati he jaise jal bin machhlee
 i have no opponent in the party
 kya aapke paas taiyaari ke liye itnaa samay he ki aap chunaav main ashok gahalot kii sarkaar ko haraa saken?unki sarkaar vidhansabha satron kaa saamana karne se hameshaa bhaagti rahi he
 For the first time in the history of Rajasthan, the Opposition had to come together and urge the President and the Governor to urge them to hold a session so that we can raise public anger in the House
 gahalot sarkaar pichley chaar saal main chaar kadam bhi nahin chal pai, janata yah jaanati he
 Gehlot has been continuously alleging that you do not live in Rajasthan and remain on serious issues
 gahalot se hi puuchhie, jinhone 2003 se 2008 tak vipaksh main rahete hue vidhansabha main ek shabd bhi nahin bolne kaa record hi nahin shaayad vishwa record banaaya he
 While i attended every session of the House, raised issues related to public interest and toured across the state
 gahalot kaa aarope he ki jaipur main stechu sarkal kii jameen par aapaki najar he
 Those who take real advantage of this include companies whose owners with whom they have admitted to their relationship with themselves
 jin maamalon main ve ham par ungali uthaate hai unheen main sauda karte rahe hai
 After becoming the state president of BJP in Rajasthan, the Chief Minister said that you should be thankful to him that he did not target against you
 ve or kah bhi kya sakate hai? chaar saal unhone ji bhar koshish kii, hajaaron filon ko khangaalane kaa kaam adhikariyon ke supurd kiya, lekin mere khilaaf kuch bhi galat nahin dhundh paae
 Repeating a lie a hundred times does not change it into a truth
 supreme court ne mere khilaaf bithaae gaye unke jaanch ayog ko radd kar diya
 In Gehlot's case you seem to take very cautious steps, why? All my attention (as Chief Minister) was focused on how to get Rajasthan out of the list of backward states
 visheshgy or niveshak safalataa kii ore agrasar rajya ke taur par mere rajya kii misaal dene lage the
 My upbringing does not allow me to fall to the extent of attacking Gehlot's personal life
 iskaa yah matlab nahin ki hamane yaa logon ne unhen clin chit de di he
 Corruption has its roots at every level
 jo adhikari paise banaate rahe hai, ab apni khayr manaanaa shuru kar den
 The rest you see ahead, what happens
 chunaavon main aapke mudde kya honge: hindutv yaa gahalot kaa bhrashtachar or ayogyata?muddon kii kami nahin he
 But why should i tell now? The Gehlot government has failed and we are definitely going to bring public problems to the fore
 alpsankhyakon ko aap kaise jodengi?gahalot jatiyon ko aapas main ladaate hai
 In September 2011, the government created conditions in Gopalgarh that killed Muslims there
 bhala ve congress ko kaise maaf kar sakate hai? jab ham satta main the, musalamaanon samet har jati-dharm ke logon ko samaan sammaan or avasar miltaa tha or sab khud ko surakshit mahasoos karte the
 Chief Minister is bringing metro to Jaipur
 kya isse aapke shahari vot bank par asar padegaa?chunaav se pehle train ko kisi tarah shuru kar dene ke chakkar main unhone zyaadaatar hisson main metro ko jameen ke upar hi rakhane kaa sochaa or is tarah unhone hamaare is aitihaasik shahar kii khubsuurati khatm kar di
 Gehlot's most favorite dice is his social schemes
 aap jarur unhen lekar chintit hongi
 Please go to the hospitals of the village and find out whether the patients are getting medicines for free
 45,000 to build a house to BPL (below Poverty Line) Rs
 do kishton main die jane the
 But you cannot even build toilets and kitchens with these money
 is baar aapako kitni siton par jeetne kii ummid he?hamaari agali jeet 2003 kii record jeet se bhi badi hogi
 Vacancies have been held for several positions at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Science

 in se saabhaar) The sedition case has been removed from the accused of murdering the inspector in the case of Bulandshahr Mob Violence in Uttar Pradesh and the murder of Police Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh
 darasal, pichley saal disambar main gauvansh ke avshesh milane ke baad hui hinsa main bheed ne bulandshahr ke syana ke inspector subodh kumaar kii beharahami se hatya kar di thi
 The police had filed a charge sheet in this entire violence against 17 people including murder, rioting and sedition in 17 sections
 mangalvaar ko bulandshahr ke district court ne aaropapatr kaa sangyaan liya or police ko fatkaar lagaate hue sabhi aropiyon ke upar se dhara 124A (deshadroh) ko hataa diya kyonki deshadroh kii dhara lagane ke liye police ne pradesh ke gruhavibhag se anumati nahin lee thi
 At the same time, Subodh Kumar's wife Rajni Singh alleges that negligence has been done by the police and the police have not completed the necessary process for the sedition section only to weaken the charge sheet, for which the court has also tortured the police
 
 enditivi se baatcheet main bulandshahr ke police adheekshak amit shrivastav ne bataaya ki upi police deshadroh kii dhara ke liye grih vibhaag se anumati lekar dobaaraa aaropapatr daakhil karegi
 Significantly, after the assassination of Inspector Subodh Kumar, the UP government was quite disgraced, even about 80 retired officers wrote letters and demanded the resignation of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 badi baat ye bhi he ki gau hatya main pakade gaye sabhi aropiyon par deshadroh kii dhara lagi hui he lekin inspector ko on duty vardi main berahami se maut ke ghat utaar dene waalon ke upar se deshadroh kii dhara hat gai he

 Sachin Tendulkar's failure in the recent Test series against New Zealand has started a discussion on whether he should retire but West Indies legend Brian Lara believes that this Indian star can play two more years
 lara ne kaha, ‘main jaanata hum ki vah khel ke tii-20 praaroop se pehle hi baahar ho chuke hai
 i do not know for sure whether he is playing a 50-over match or not, but as far as Test cricket is concerned, he can play two more years
 vah ab bhi test or ekadivasiy antarrashtriya cricket main dheron ran bana sakate hai
 The former West Indies captain, who started his international career after a year with the Indian batsman, said that Tendulkar has no answer and whenever he retires, the cricket world will miss him
 unhone kaha, ‘main samajhataa hum ki unhone (tendulkar) behtareen bhoomika nibhaai he
 Who, i am not sure, has started playing (international) cricket for 15 or 16 years and is still playing
 is tarah se unhone mere se ek yaa do saal pehle khelnaa shuru kiya or mere sanyas lene ke paanch saal baad bhi vah khel rahe hai
 "he is close to completing 25 years in international cricket and not only Sachin but all Indians should be proud of it," Lara said
 ’ kul 131 test match main 11,953 ran banane vaale lara ke naam par test maichon kii ek pari main sarvaadhik 400 ran banane kaa ricard darj he
 He said that in terms of skill and ability, Tendulkar is miles ahead of the rest
 unhone kaha, ‘ham jaanate hai ki vah choton se bhi pareshaan rahe lekin apane kaushal or bejod kshamta ke kaaran vah itane lambey samay tak ranon kaa ambara lagane or sheersh par bane rahane main safal rahe
 i believe that he has played a great role and when he retires, world cricket will miss him a lot
 ’lara ne kaha ki tendulkar bhadrajan he or aise cricketer he jis par vishwa cricketer ko hameshaa naaj rahegaa
 He said, 'I played with and against him on a few occasions
 main samajhataa hum ki vah bhadrajan hai or vishwa cricket ko un par naaj hona chahie
 Lara also praised Mahendra Singh Dhoni's captaincy and said that the Indian captain should be allowed to decide his future
 unhone kaha, ‘pichley chaar-paanch saalon main unhone bhartiya captain ke rup main behtareen bhoomika nibhaai he
 i understand that questions have been raised about them but only they know when to retire
 koi bhi captain barkhaast hona pasand nahin karata
 Therefore, they should be allowed to decide their own future
 ’lara ne kaha ki westeindies kii team yadi ikai ke taur par khelti he to vah bhi khitaab jeet sakati he
 He said, 'west Indies team is very good but they do well in pieces
 unke paas sarvshereshth ballebaaj, sarvshereshth gendbaaj or sarvshereshth alrounder hai lekin unhen samuhik rup se pradarshan karnaa hoga
 They are really dangerous as a group and we are title contenders
 ’lara ne khel ke sabase chote praaroop ke bare main kaha ki khel ko abhi isaki jarurat he
 He said, 'T20 is a very interesting format
 cricket ko abhi isaki jarurat he
 We have seen many exciting players in this format
 main bhi ise khelnaa pasand karata lekin abhi main darshak banakar hi lutf uthaa rahaa hum
 ' skool-college ke dinon main hua pyaar zyaadaatar kitabon ke pannon main simatakar rah jaataa he
 Many times it happens that it connects with the bond of births, but such stories are rarely heard
 kya aapane kabhi sochaa he ki aisa kyon hota he ki tinej kaa pyaar ek mistry banakar rah jaataa he?relationships ke maamalon ke lekar hone vaale research main haal main yah baat saamne ai he ki tinej lav pyaar to hota he lekin usase zyada complications aani shuru ho jaati hai or isi vajah se dhire-dhaare soft feelings puri tarah khatm ho jaati he
 What Says Researcher's Code Author Thao Ha says that people try to resolve any relationship and post-marriage disputes, but if something like this happens in teenedge, the couples start looking for ways to avoid each other
 is study se anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he ki nabbe fisadi tinej lav safal nahin hote
 Let's know, these five things of Teenage Love that bring conflict in the relationship
 
 
 1
 Attraction starts with love in early age, feeling more inclined towards external beauty and charm and this is the reason why they just fail to understand each other's feelings well
 2
 Time comes together to spend time with each other at the beginning of Mazapyar, the main moto of the cones is the common and often common practice of bunk class or lying at home
 lekin jab in sabaki vajah se kariyar or padhai kaa nuksaan hota he to blem-game shuru ho jate hai
 It is from here that quarrels and talk of bad things happen
 3
 Lack of patience, everything is going well and suddenly everything falls apart when one refuses to one day
 darasal tinej lavastory main kisi ek ke manaa karne par doosraa ye sochane lagata he ki shaayad uskaaman unase bhar gayaahai or aisa adhiktar ladakiyon ke saath hota he
 4
 rishta zyaadaatar timopas lagata hatinej lav main care or rispect donon chizon ko samaj paanaa thodaa mushical hota he or isi vajah se couples aksar ek-duusare ko samaj nahin pate he
 Boys unnecessarily try to assert their rights and this is why girls start feeling insecure
 5
 Feelings of jealousy become the first cause of any breakup
 tinej ho yaa edlt, jalan har umr ke relationships main hoti he
 In adult relationships, each other is understood, whereas the imprudence of Teenage does not allow it to be understood

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is not ready to take any responsibility from the Congress on the meeting of PM Narendra Modi in the Parliament complex on Friday
 is mulaakaat ke baad badi mushkil se sheetakaaleen satr main ekajute hue vipaksh kii ekta main daraar padane kaa khatra paidaa ho gaya
 On the last day of the winter session, Rahul Gandhi met PM Modi when the opposition party led by the Congress was to meet the President a few minutes later on the question of demonetisation
 ve raashtrapati ko yah bataane ke liye jane vaale the ki pradhanmantri kii 500 or 1000 rupee kii achaanak ghoshnaa ke baad se aam logon ko behad dushwariyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 This move by the Congress led to an immediate announcement by the opposition parties, including the Left, that they would not join that march
 mana ja rahaa he ki congress kii taraf se do saptaah pehle pradhanmantri se mulaakaat ke liye apointment maanga gaya tha
 Actually the Congress wanted to hand over the list of demands received from the farmers to them
 duusari taraf notebandi ke masale par vipakshi ekajutata ke saamne lagaataar ghir rahi sarkaar ne ain maukey par mulaakaat kaa samay dekar us ekta ko tod diya
 In fact, a round of resentment and accusation has started within the Congress on this issue and discord has once again come to the surface between the Rahul Gandhi-led youth team and Sonia's trusted old stalwarts
 congressi netaa jyotiraditya sindhiya ne in reporton kaa khandan kiya he ki unhone piem modi se is mulaakaat ke liye samay maanga tha
 But it also said that once the appointment was fixed, it was not possible for Rahul Gandhi to ignore him
 darasal kuch samay pehle rahul gandhi ne upi ke kisaanon se mulaakaat ke baad kaha tha ki vah nijee taur par unki maangon ko piem modi tak pahunchaayenge
 It is worth mentioning that assembly elections are going to be held in UP early next year
 sansad main congress kii ranneeti banane vaale party ke varisht netaaon gulam nabi aaazaad or anand sharma ne bhi khandan kiya ki ve us meeting main rahul kii upasthiti chaahate the
 According to sources, the opposition parties had urged the Congress that this meeting of Rahul Gandhi should be postponed for another day
 uski badi vajah yah thi ki puure sheetakaaleen satr ke dauraan notebandi ke masale par vipaksh kii taraf se morcha lene main rahul kii mukhya bhoomika rahi thi
 But overall this could not be possible
 tippaniyan In this regard, NCP leader Praful Patel said, "congress alone decided to meet PM Modi
" yah koi tarika nahin he
 Similarly, a BSP leader said that we are not worried about the migration of farmers? Like the SP, the BSP did not even meet the President
 congress ke bheetar is maamle main naaraazgi bhari sugabugahat ho rahi he
 In fact, two days before that, Rahul Gandhi had claimed that he had information regarding PM Modi's 'personal corruption' and would expose it if he was given an opportunity to speak in Parliament
 lekin satr ke antim din usko ujagar karne ke bajaay piem modi se rahul gandhi mulaakaat karne chale gaye
 On the other hand, the Lok Sabha gave so much opportunity to the House that the bill related to the right of the disabled was passed
 sheetakaaleen satr ke antim din rahul gandhi ne piem modi se us vakt mulaakaat kii jab uske kuch kshan baad congress ke netritv main vipakshi dal notebandi ke sawaal par raashtrapati se milane vaale the
 He was about to tell the President that the common people are facing a lot of enemies since the Prime Minister's sudden announcement of 500 and 1000 rupees
 congress ke is kadam se left samet khafa vipakshi dalon ne fori taur par ghoshnaa karte hue kaha ki vah us march main shaamil nahin honge
 It is believed that an appointment was made by the Congress to meet the Prime Minister two weeks ago
 darasal congress kisaanon se mili maangon kii suchi unako saunpna chaahati thi
 On the other hand, on the issue of demonetisation, the government, which is constantly facing opposition unity, broke the unity by giving an appointment on one occasion
 darasal is masale par congress ke bheetar naaraazgi or aarope-pratyarope kaa daur shuru ho gaya he or rahul gandhi ke netritv vaali yuva team or sonia ke vishwast puraane diggajon ke bich kalah ek baar phir sataha par aa gai he
 Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia denied reports that he had sought time for this meeting with PM Modi
 lekin yah bhi kaha ki ek baar mulaakaat kaa samay tay hone ke baad rahul gandhi ke liye usko nazarandaaj karnaa mumkin nahin tha
 In fact, some time ago, after meeting Gandhi's farmers, Rahul Gandhi had said that he would personally convey his demands to PM Modi
 ullekhneey he ki upi main agle saal kii shuruyaat main vidhansabha chunaav hone ja rahe hai
 Senior party leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and Anand Sharma, who strategized the Congress in Parliament, also denied that they wanted Rahul's presence at that meeting
 sutron ke mutabik vipakshi dalon ne congress se aagrah kiya tha ki rahul gandhi kii is meeting ko kisi anya din ke liye taal diya janaa chahie
 The main reason for this was that during the entire winter session, Rahul played a major role in taking a front on behalf of the opposition on the issue of demonetisation
 lekin kul milakar aisa sambhav nahin ho sakaa
 The comments is sambandh main ensipi netaa praphul patel ne kaha, ''congress ne akele hi piem modi se milane kaa nishchay kiya
 This is not the way
 '' isi tarah basapa ke ek netaa ne kaha ki kya ham kisaanon ke palaayan se chintit nahin hai? sapa kii tarah basapa bhi raashtrapati se milane nahin pahunchi
 There is an angry murmur in this matter within the Congress
 darasal uske do din pehle hi rahul gandhi ne daawa kiya tha ki unke paas piem modi ke 'nijee bhrashtachar' ke sambandh main jaankaree he or yadi unako sansad main bolne kaa mauka diya gaya to vah uskaa pardaafash kar denge
 But instead of exposing him on the last day of the session, Rahul Gandhi went to meet PM Modi
 vahiin duusari taraf loksabhaa main sadan chalane kaa itnaa mauka de diya ki divyangon ke adhikaar se sambandhit bill paas ho gaya

 varanasi loksabhaa seat par ummidavaar utaarne ko lekar congress party ke bich maathaa pachchi jari he
 The party high command wants to field a strong candidate against bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi so that a strong message is sent to the public
 congress kaaryakartaaon ne to priyanka gandhi ko banaras se ladaane kii maang kar daali he
 Congress's ally NCP leader Tariq Anwar has also supported Priyanka
 tarik anwar ne 'aaj tak' se kaha, 'priyanka gandhi ek acchhee ummidavaar hongi or modi ko kadi takkar de sakati hai
 i understand that the fight will be fought, it will be a tough challenge
 sabhi secular dalon kaa ek ummidavaar hona chahie
 So that he can defeat Modi
 saajha ummidavaar ke taur par priyanka ke naam par baaki secular partiyon ko bhi manaane main mushkil nahin hogi
 'earlier, Congress leader Anil Shastri also demanded that the opposition parties should put up a common candidate against Modi
 gauratlab he ki congress kheme main pichley kai dinon se kai naamon par charchaa chal rahi he
 The Congress Central Election Committee is also thinking deeply about the Banaras seat
 party ke bheetar ajay raay, rajesh mishra, mohan prakaash or anil shastri ke naam par charchaa ho rahi he to digvajay singh or anand sharma jaise diggaj netaa bhi modi ke khilaaf ladke ke liye taal thok rahe hai
 However, the big question is whether the Congress will use the trump card for Priyanka's name? The party leaders are neither accepting nor denying this
 gujarat congress ke netaa shakti singh gohil kehete hai, 'yah party kii kendriya chunaav samiti tay karegi ki banaras se koun ummidavaar hoga
 But, our candidate will be strong
 kendriya mantri rajeev shukla ne kaha, 'mujhe isaki jaankaree nahin he ki modi ek chamatkaarik netaa hai par banaras main muqabla congress banaam bijepi hoga, ye tay he
 Anyway, this is not the first time that there has been a demand to bring Priyanka into active politics
 lekin baar baar congress party ne yahi doharaaya he ki priyanka kii bhoomika amethi or raibareli tak hi simit he

 Still, there was an attempt to merge the Muslim League with the Congress, but Jinnah, who considered Hindus and Muslims as two distinct identities, was not at all allowed to give up his identity and selfishness of the Muslim leader
 jinna ne dvirashtrawaad kaa siddhant oochaal diya
 Rahmat Ali had already submitted a draft of a separate country in the name of Pakistan, on which Jinnah did such a disgusting politics which came out as the partition of the country

 AMU, an important bastion of education in India, is now boiling over the hatred of whether Jinnah's picture should be here or not, which started with the demand of local BJP MP that what is the work of Jinnah's picture in Hindustan? From the letter written to the Vice Chancellor on behalf of MP Satish Gautam, why should the picture of Jinnah who got India partitioned remain in the university
 is par hindutv kii duhai dene vaale sanghathanon ne virodh pradarshan karnaa shuru kiya
 There were violent clashes between the student union and Hindu organizations
 or phir dekhte dekhte aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay chhavnee main badal gaya
 In 1936, Jinnah pulled the line of mental division between Hindus and Muslims
 uske do saal baad aligarh uniwarsity kii is darodivar par ye tasviir lagi
 Only after 9 years the country got independence and this face of the picture went to Pakistan and became the Governor General
 lekin 80 saal se khamoshi main tangi is tasviir par ab phijaaen cheekhney lagi hai
 On May 2, Hindu organizations demonstrated at amu's campus
 jinna kaa putala bhi foonka gaya
 There was a program of former Vice President Hamid Ansari, which had to be canceled
 in sabake bich virodh main jab chaatr dharne par baithe to aarope laga ki unhone ek patrkaar kii pitayee kar di
 amu's ruckus came out of Aligarh to Lucknow and Delhi and started running after politics
 itane ghamaasan ke baavjood eemyu prashasan kaa kahana he ki jinna bhale hi bhartiya itihaas kaa gunahagaar ho, lekin us syah panne ko jaananaa bhi jaruri he
 So the question is whether Jinnah's picture in the same name will continue to shine on the forehead of a great educational institution of the country
 jinna 1947 ke hindustan kaa apradhi he, jisane nai nai aazaadee paane vaale ek desh ko khooni bantwaare kaa shikaar bana diya
 But just as every criminal can have a good past, Jinnah also has a past
 ateet ke un pannon main kahin jinna hindu musalmaan ekta ke pairokaar dikhte hai to kahin lokmaanya tilak ko rajdroh se bachaane vaale barrister ke rup main
 Muhammad Ali Jinnah was another three decades before the bloody Partition of India in 1947
 us jinna main desh ke liye ladane or angrejon ko bharat se hataane kaa jajba tha
 The Congress leader with whom Jinnah was most affected was Lokmanya Balgangadhar Tilak
 jab krantikari khudiram bose or prafull chaaki kii faansee kii sajaa hui to tilak ne apane akhbaar kesari main turant swaraj kii maang uthaai
 On this, the British prosecuted Tilak for treason, in which Jinnah was advocating on his behalf
 lekin jinna tilak ko bachaa nahin paae or wo rajdroh ke maamle main myanmar ke mandley jail main 1908 se 1914 tak chah saal tak kaid rahe
 But after two years when the British once again prosecuted Tilak for treason, Jinnah became his lawyer again and this time he also saved Tilak
 iske baad tilak or jinna ke rishton main itani majbootee ai ki usee saal yani 1916 main hi donon ke bich tilak-jinna pact hua
 In it it was decided that both the communities would throw full force for the hindu-muslim unity and fight the British with the same strength
 lekin chaar saal baad 1920 main tilak kii mrityu ho gai or jinna dhire dhire congress kii raajnneeti se dur hote gaye
 And later this same Jinnah became the biggest factor of partition of India

 The Court has given a new definition to such a relationship while giving a ruling in a live-in relationship case
 court ne kai muddon par apana najariya bhi diya he
 The Supreme Court has given this decision in a case in which the woman, knowing her intentionally, kept the live in relation to the married man
 is dauraan yuvak ne yuvati se lakhon kaa udhaar bhi liya jo chukaaya nahin gaya
 Finally, fed up with the young man's motives, the woman pleaded for alimony in the court, accusing her partner of domestic violence
 supreme court main justise ke es radhakrishnan or pinaki chandra ghosh ne apane faisle main saaf kaha ki liv in relationships main rahanaa naa to aparaadh he naa hi paap
 Someone stays married or without marriage
 
 
 ye uskaa nijee faisla he
 But the court also made it clear that each case of live in relationship cannot be kept on the same table
 court ne kaha ki bina shaadi ke yuvak-yuvati saath rahen ye to thik he lekin kisi shaadishuda or bal bacchon vaale yuvak ke saath liv in relationships main rahanaa or phir guzaara bhatta kii maang karnaa uchit nahin he
 Because it will directly affect the legitimate wife and children
 ye unke saath anyaay hoga
 Once married, a partner living in a live-in relationship cannot get wife status
 wo patni se neeche hi rahegi
 But it is the responsibility of the government to enact appropriate laws in Parliament to protect the rights of children born from such relationships
 kyonki aise halaat main sabase zyada bura asar aise bacchon par hi padataa he

 janata dal united (JDU) ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh prashanth kishor (prashant Kishor) ne shuukravaar ko twit kar saaf kar diya ki is baar bihar (bihar) main unki party ke chunaav prachaar or prabandhan kii jimmedaari party ke varisht netaa ramchandra prasad singh (RCP Singh) ke majboot kandhon par he or unki bhoomika philhal raajnneeti ke shuruaati daur main bhoomika seekhney or sahyog karne kii he
 However, Prashant Kishore has also acknowledged in his tweet that the NDA in Bihar is contesting strongly under the leadership of Honorable Modi ji and Nitish Kumar
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki prashanth kishor (prashant Kishor) ne yah twit jaanboojhkar saarvajanik karke ek tarah se sweekaar kiya ki party supremeo nitish kumaar ne unhen is chunaav main koi kaam nahin diya he
 The entire responsibility of campaigning to management is on RCP Singh's shoulders
 bihar main NDA mananeey modi ji evam nitish ji ke netritv main majbootee se chunaav lard rahaa he
 The responsibility of campaigning and management on behalf of JDU lies on the strong shoulders of the senior and experienced leader of the party, Mr
 RCP Singh
 mere raajnneeti ke is shuruaati daur main meri bhoomika seekhney or sahyog kii he
 RCP Singh, popularly known as Ramchandra Babu within the party, has been a close friend of Nitish Kumar for the last two decades
 saal 2010 se party ke kartadharta bhi vahi rahe hai
 However, till Sharad Yadav was the national president, RCP Singh was more active in the politics of Bihar and in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections he did everything from booth management to the selection of candidates himself
 unki khaasiyat he ki ve patrakaron se apane bare main zyada baat karnaa pasand nahin karte hai
 Perhaps this is the quality due to which he remained the nose hair of Nitish Kumar despite all the ups and downs
 saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad party ke adhikansh netaa saarvajanik rup se aaaraseepi singh ko party kii durgati ke liye jimmedaar maan rahe the lekin nitish kumaar ne sthiti bhaanpate hue haar kaa jimmaa khud apane upar le liya or istipha dekar unhone bihar kii raajnneeti kaa agenda hi badal daalaa
 RCP Singh was not very active in the last assembly election due to his alliance with Lalu Yadav because Lalu did not like him and Prashant Kishore (lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar) on behalf of Lalu in that election
 Prashant Kishor) played the role of political messenger
 chunaav parinaam aae to prashanth kishor ko jamkar credit mila
 Although Nitish Kumar still believes that the Grand Alliance had a high vote share and its face, the management's role in it was very limited
 iske baad nayaa adhyay us samay shuru hua jab prashanth kishor (prashant Kishor) ne janata dal united vidhivat rup se jwine kiya or nitish kumaar ne unhen bhavishya bataaya
 After this, many reports also started coming as if Nitish Kumar accepted him as his successor
 yahaan prashanth ek baat kii chook kar gaye
 Nitish not only reads the news in newspapers and social media, but if he does not know the background of the news writer, then he is also interested in him
 isliye pehle hi din se nitish ne sabko saaf kar diya ki prashanth kishor kii bhoomika party se yuvaaon ko jodne kii hogi
 At the same time, Prashant hoped that Nitish would put the entire party's election work, as well as the responsibility of campaigning, on his shoulder
 lekin aisa hua nahin
 Nitish Kumar had a few things to do with him, including the issue of his return to the BJP in constant television interviews
 ab jab prashanth kishor (prashant Kishor) ke khilaaf sidhe party ke pravaktaa niraj kumaar ne bayaan dena shuru kiya or ek nahin lagaataar teen dinon tak unhone unke upar hamale kiye, unki aalochana kii to prashanth kishor ko yah bhram nahin rahaa ki yah sab kuch nitish kumaar kii sahmati se ho rahaa he, kyonki agar unhen koi chiz pasand nahin hoti he to pravaktaa ko yah sandesh de diya jaataa he ki ab ve is mudde par chup rahen
 Prashant Kishore had everything approved but perhaps it was not getting down his throat that every party in the country is contacting him for campaigning and his own party is ignoring him
 unhone aakhirkaar vah twit kar diya jiske baad party main rama yaa naaraa aana koi myne nahin rakhata, kyonki prashanth kishor ko bhi maaloom he ki kshetreey dalon main 'dulhan vahi jo piya man bhaae' yani agar supremeo aapse kush nahin he to aap ek jinda laash ke alaava or kuch nahin
 However, Nitish Kumar knows that the votebank that the NDA currently has in Bihar and the scatter in the opposition, they do not need Prashant Kishor as much as Prashant Kishor needs them in politics
 nitish yah bhi jaanate hai ki agar prashanth kishor chhodkar chale bhi jate hai to bijepi jaise sahyogi khush hi honge
 Therefore, it is even more true that Nitish Kumar wants his political successor only to the leader of a backward society
 is sambandh main unke man main koi kanfusion nahin he
 And his trust in RCP Singh is still unwavering
 saal 2013 main salmaan khan or shahrukh khan ne us vakt sabko chaunkaa diya tha jab unhone baba siddiqui kii iftaar party main naa sirf haath milaayaa balki ek-duusare ko gale bhi laga liya
 This was a historic moment in Bollywood and even after 6 years, the end of the cold war between the two was over
 aisa hi kuch ek baar phir hua he
 Yes, Salman Khan and Shahrukh Khan once again hugged each other in the Star Guild on Wednesday
 khabar ke mutabik salmaan khan aword samaaroh ke ankar the isliye stage par maujuud the
 Then Shah Rukh Khan arrived in Venu and started moving towards the chair to sit, then Salman said to him, 'shahrukh, what is happening'? He then congratulated Shahrukh for the immense success of 'chennai Express'
 shahrukh ne bhi deree nahin kii or unhone salmaan kii badhai kaa haath hilaakar abhinandan kiya
 Later Salman said that he would prefer to perform in the show instead of hosting the show
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe nahin pataa tha main itnaa lanbaa segment host karuunga
 It all started with Shahrukh Saab '
 yahi nahin salmaan ne shahrukh se 'jai ho' bolne ke liye bhi kaha, jo unki aane vaali film kaa tital he
 Shahrukh too kept his friend and said 'jai Ho'
 aapako bataa den ki isse pehle jab iftaar party main salmaan or shahrukh gale mili the to salmaan ke pita ne kaha tha yah mahaj shishtachar tha or ve kabhi achche dost nahin ban sakate kyonki ve ek-duusare ke pratidwandi hai
 It is known by all that that Dushmani started in Shah Rukh and Salman 6 years from today on the birthday of Katrina Kaif in 2008
 bataaya jaataa he ki us vakt aishwarya raay bachchan ko lekar salmaan or shahrukh main jabardast tu-tu, main-main ho gai thi
 And since then, both of them have grown up
 khayr, ho saktaa he ki ab donon kii ye dosti aage tak jaae yaa phir kahin ye ek or ladaai kii shuruyaat to nahin

 ' hyderabad main khele gaye pehle test match main spin gendbaajon ke saamne newjiland kaa safaya sabane dekha
 India's spin bowlers heavily impressed the visiting Kiwi batsmen and the New Zealand captain acknowledged his and the team's weakness against the spin at the end of the match
 lekin newjiland main apni team ke captain kii daleelon ko cricket ke jaankaar sweekaar nahin kar rahe hai
 Former New Zealand coach Greatbatch is extremely upset about the performance of the Kiwi team
 unhone team ko jamkar latada he
 The comments hyderabad main ravichandran aswin or pragyan ojha kii jodi ne 20 main se 18 kiwi ballebaajon ko pavilion kii raah dikhaai or mehmaan team kaa sirf ek ballebaaj ardhshtak puraa kar paaya
 Greatbatches are now also questioning the ability of Kiwi batsmen
 greatbatch ke mutabik pichley chaar-paanch saalon main newjiland ke khilaadiyon ko spin khilne ke bare main kaaphi kuch sikhaaya gaya, ballebaajon ko spinneron kii madadgaar pich par taiyaari karwaai gai, lekin khilaadi shaayad kuch siikhnaa hi nahin chaahate
 Not only this, team captain Ross Taylor is also disappointed with the performance of his batsmen
 tailor khud hyderabad kii donon pariyon main naakaam rahe, lekin vah maanate hai ki unke ballebaajon kii takanic main nahin, balki maansik taiyaariyon main kami he
 In Hyderabad, the pair of Ravichandran Ashwin and Pragyan Ojha showed 18 of the 20 Kiwi batsmen to pavilion and only one batsman of the visiting team completed the half-century
 greatbatch ab kiwi ballebaajon kii kabaliyat par bhi sawaal khadey kar rahe hai
 According to Greatbatch, during the last four-five years, New Zealand players have been taught a lot about playing spin, the batsmen have to prepare for the spinners on the pitch, but the players may not want to learn anything
 yahi nahin, team ke captain ross tailor bhi apane ballebaajon ke pradarshan se maayoos hai
 Taylor himself failed in both innings in Hyderabad, but he admits that his batsmen are lacking in mental preparation, not in technique
 greatbatch ke mutabik pichley chaar-paanch saalon main newjiland ke khilaadiyon ko spin khilne ke bare main kaaphi kuch sikhaaya gaya, ballebaajon ko spinneron kii madadgaar pich par taiyaari karwaai gai, lekin khilaadi shaayad kuch siikhnaa hi nahin chaahate

 Sri Lankan bowler Chitra Senanayake has created a huge controversy in the ongoing ODI tournament with England
 mangalvaar ko egebaston main donon tiimon ke bich paanchvaan van de khelaa gaya
 England suffered defeat in this match
 maamla yah tha ki senanayake ne england ke ballebaaj jose butler ko ran out kar diya, jo non striker the or gendbaaji ke dauraan baar-baar baahar nikal rahe the
 Senanayake cautioned him, but when he came out of the crease before the next ball, the bowler dropped wickets instead of bowling
 unki apil par ampire ne butler ko ran out de diya jo niyamon ke anusaar sahi he
 However, the umpire spoke to Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews about whether he was ready to withdraw the appeal
 maithyuj taiyaar nahin hue kyonki unhen lag rahaa tha ki butler pichley match kii tarah khatra paidaa kar sakate hai
 Butler had scored a century at Lord's
 maithyuj ke inkaar ke baad ampire ne butler ko out qaraar diya
 Sri Lanka won this match but it has created disharmony in both the teams
 aalochakon kaa kahana he ki yah ran out khel bhaavana ke vipareet he
 This should not have happened
 bharat ne apil waapas lee theis tarah kaa ek maamla farvari 2012 main bharat-srilanka ke match main bhi aayaa tha
 At that time Sri Lankan batsman Lahiru Tirimane was dismissed by Ashwin at the Sydney Cricket Ground in a similar manner
 ampire ne use out bhi de diya tha
 But the then captain Virender Sehwag withdrew that appeal and called back Tirimane
 iske baad tirimane ne dhuandhar ballebaaji karke vah match srilanka ko jita diya
 Ranatunga criticized former Sri Lankan captain Ranatunga criticized the team for this
 unhone kaha ki unhen yah apil waapas le leni chahie thi
 He said that Butler should have been recalled
 yah khel bhaavana ke paksh main hota
 England captain Alastair Cook also expressed displeasure over this and said that i have never seen this happen in this game
 unhone kaha ki is tarah se ek seemaa rekha paar kii gai he
 He dwells in every moon of the Quran in the moon stars, Iran, Hazrat Kabhi Khwaja, who says that even Allah has lost human dignity, the voice of the mother-in-law, the small steps that came out of her house were left out but, Let Jannat go, we are sure that those people will not find it at home, in Dzakh also this house has been written by our colleague Suvasit Dutt

 Australian opener Aaron Finch did not even know before the match about rules like DRS being implemented in T20
 finch neranchi tii-20ke baad kaha ki siries ke bich main isisi ke nae niyam lagu hone se kanfusion kii sthiti paidaa hui
 Even Team India's opener Shikhar Dhawan was not fully aware of these new T20 rules
 30 saal ke finch ne kaha, 'match ke 5wein over tak mujhe is bare main pataa hi nahin tha
 Later, when Steve Smith brought a drink to the ground, he told fellow players about it
 isliye hamen ampiron se poochna padaa
 But these changes in the rules in the last round of the series are strange
 meraa matlab he ki bat sies or aisi chijen siries ke ant main aa rahi hai
 According to the new ICC rule, if a match is reduced by 10 overs, the maximum bowling quota will not be less than 2 overs
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki yadi match 5 over kaa kar diya gaya he to kam se kam do gendbaaj do-do over phenk paaenge
 Finch was also angry about the rule of overs
 bharat ko jeet ke liye 6 over main 48 ranon kaa lakshya mila, aise main 3 gendbaajon ko do over phenkane kii ijaajat honi chahie thi
 But the old rules were allowed to run
 sirf nathan kulter nile hi 2 over phenk paae, jabaki adam jampa, andryu taai, jesan behrendroph or dainiel chrishchiyan ek-ek over phenke
 At Team India's press conference, Dhawan admitted, 'he (australia) must have felt strange
 lekin jo bhi niyam he, vah niyam he
 i do not know precisely the rule you are talking about
 lekin, ye he to he
 '
 
 
 or finch kaa brinfed!australia ke salaami ballebaaj aaron finch ne kaha ki kalai ke spinner kuldeep yadav kaa saamana karte samay unka dimag thodaa bhatak gaya tha or vah out ho gaye
 Australia's innings collapsed as Finch was dismissed in the first match of the first T20 series played on Saturday
 bharat ne yah match dakworth louis paddati se 9 wicket se jeet liya
 Like the one-day series, Finch also appeared in rhythm here
 unhone is match main 42 ran par out hone se pehle paanch baar sweep shot khelaa tha, lekin yadav kii ek phul length gend par vah chook gaye or bold ho gaye
 Finch said, 'I thought sweeping here is a safe option
 isse main strike se hat saktaa tha or khaali jagah main khelkar gend ko seemaa rekha ke paar bhej saktaa tha
 The ball i was out on had a slight wander in my mind
 ' Rajnandgaon is a city in the Rajnandgaon district of Chhattisgarh

 The splendor and heritage of this city can still be seen

 Political background: a total of 16 elections have been held on this Lok Sabha seat since independence
 rajanandgaanv nirvachan kshetra main 1952 se lekar 1999 tak 13 baar chunaav hue
 Most of the results have been in favor of the Congress
 saal 2000 main madhya pradesh ke vibhaajan se bane chhattisgarh ke astitv main aane ke baad se yahaan 2007 main ek upachunaav ke alaava teen loksabhaa chunaav hue hai
 The BJP has managed to capture the seat since 1999 in all elections (1999, 2004, 2009, 2014), except for the 2007 by-elections
 saamaajik taana-banise shahar par somavanshiyon, kalchuriyon rajwanshon or baad main maratha jaise mashhoor rajwanshon dwaara shashan kiya gaya
 In the early days the city was called Nandagram
 rajanandgaanv rajya asal main 1830 main astitv main aayaa
 Bairagi Vaishnav Mahanta shifted his capital to the present Rajnandgaon
 bhagwaan krishna, nand, nandgram ke vanshajon ke naam par is shahar kaa naam rakhaa gaya
 However, the name was soon changed to Rajnandgaon
 rajya ke aakaar ke kaaran nandgram zyaadaatar hindu kaa hindu raajaaon or rajwanshon ke adheen rahaa
 Historical Background In 1865, the British recognized the then ruler Mahant Ghasi Das as the ruler of Rajnandgaon
 nandgram ke saamanti pramukh ko baad main british sarkaar dwaara raja bahadur kii oopaadhi se sammanit kiya gaya
 After this its succession was given to the rulers like King Mahant Balaram Das Bahadur, Mahant Rajendra Das Vaishnav, Mahant Sarveshwar Das Vaishnav, Mahant Digvijay Das Vaishnav
 rajanandgaanv riyasat kii rajdhani rajanandgaanv thi or shaskaon kaa nivas bhi tha
 However, with the passage of time, the Mahanta rulers of Rajnandgaon became puppets of the British Empire
 iske saath hi bharat kaa ek samrudh rajya british raaj kii ek riyasat ban gaya
 After independence, Rajnandgaon remained a princely state in the newly independent country called the United Republic of India
 1948 main riyasat or rajdhani rajanandgaanv ko madhya bharat ke durg jile main mila diya gaya
 Later it was made a part of Madhya Pradesh
 1973 main, rajanandgaanv durg jile se baahar ho gaya or nae rajanandgaanv jile kaa gathan kiya gaya tha
 Rajnandgaon became the administrative headquarters of the district
 haalanki, 1998 main rajanandgaanv jile ke ek hisse ke saath bilaspur jile ke ek hisse ko milakar madhya pradesh kaa ek nayaa jila kabirdham bana diya gaya
 The history of Rajnandgaon took a turn again in 2000 when Chhattisgarh was carved out of Madhya Pradesh after a long demand
 is tarah rajanandgaanv ek mahatvapurn shahar or ek alag jila bana rahaa
