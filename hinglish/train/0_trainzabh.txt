 kendriya grih mantralay ne dilli ke vidhayakon kii selary badhaane vaala bill naamanzoor kar diya or dilli sarkaar ko waapas bhej diya
 Now politics has started on this whole matter
 bijepi saansad ramesh vidhudi ne kaha he ki grih mantralay kaa faisla janata ke hit main he, kyonki vidhayakon kii selary badhaane se janata ke paise kii barbaadi hoti
 Also, neither the government adopted the right way to increase salary nor took care of public interest
 vidhudi ne kaha ki teen guna selary bhala kahaan badhaai jaati he, lekin kejariwal apane vidhayakon or kaaryakartaaon ko phayda pahunchane ke liye dilli ke sarkari khazaane ko donon haathon se lutaa rahe hai, lekin bijepi ko ye bardaasht nahin he or saath hi centre sarkaar aise kisi bhi bill kaa manjuuri nahin degi
 Ramesh Vidhuri said that the matter of increasing salary is a sign of shamelessness of Kejriwal, it was Kejriwal who used to say before the election that he will not take a single rupee salary, neither will he buy a car nor a bungalow, but after forming the government, the government treasury Left no stone unturned in the destruction of vidhudi ne aarope lagaaya ki jab se sarkaar bani he, tab se kejariwal kuch na kuch aisa karte rahe hai, jisamen unke kaaryakartaaon ko aarthik phayda pahunche
 Whether it is the issue of salary of legislators, or the appointment of parliamentary secretaries or the appointment of Aam Aadmi Party workers on a hefty salary, everywhere the intention is to loot the government treasury
 ramesh vidhudi ne kaha ki centre sarkaar kahin kejariwal sarkaar ke kaamkaaj main adnga nahin daalati
 If the Kejriwal works according to the rules and the constitution, the bill has no objection in approving it, but Kejriwal's motive is not to work but to create a ruckus
 unhone kaha ki dilli sarkaar ke skool main mid de mile main chuha milane ke baad jo baat saamne aayi he usase bhi yahi sabit hota he ki sarkaar puri tarah se bhai-bhatijawad main dubi hui he, kyonki is thekedaar kii bhi aap ke vidhayak se kareebi rishtedaari he

 In such a situation, after the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, it has to be seen who among jyotiraditya-priyanka is able to improve their track record? After the Lok Sabha elections, political parties have started preparing for the by-election
 aam chunaav main saath ladane vaali sapa or basapa ne akele upachunaav main utarane kaa elaan kar diya he
 At the same time, Congress has also decided to go alone in the election field
 raajnneetik kushalta dikhaane kaa behatar maukapriyanka gandhi ke prabhaar vaale kshetra se saat vidhayak is baar saansad banane main safal rahe hai, jiske chalate unki vidhansabha siten khaali hui hai

 Due to this, by-elections are to be held in Mirpur and Hamirpur seats
 pashchimi uttar pradesh ke prabharee jyotiraditya sindhiya loksabhaa chunaav main karishma nahin dikhaa sake
 In western Uttar Pradesh, there is only one seat in Saharanpur, where party candidate Imran Masood has managed to get nearly two lakh votes
 iske alaava baaki ummidavaaron ko apni jamaanat bachaane ke laale pad gaye the
 In such a situation, the by-election is a better chance of proving yourself in front of Scindia
 pashchimi upi kii jo 6 siten khaali hui hai, inamen se 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main 5 siten bijepi or ek seat par sapa ne jeet darj kii thi
 In this way, Congress did not have any of these seats, so Scindia has nothing to lose in the by-election but better chance to increase his base
 congress ne banaaya plancongress upachunaav main apni maujuudagi dikhaane or jeet ke liye sabhi 13 siton par ek-ek prabharee banane ja rahi he
 He will meet the workers of block, sector and booth level directly

 isaki report par hi congress apana candidet tay karegi
 Apart from this, a list of people working hard in the Lok Sabha elections is being prepared for the Congress, so that they can be honored by giving them important responsibility in the organization

 Suresh, who runs an auto rickshaw in the capital Delhi, could not be a part of the Adhikar rally on March 17 at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan to get special status
 mahatma gandhi ke samadhi sthal rajghat se aage badhate hue sahasaa ve poochhate hai, ‘‘kya aap log raily se aa rahe hai? kya kaha nitish ji ne? sar, nitish bhi kya kar lenge, bihar ke paas power (bijli) hi nahin he
 This work is central
 bihar ko special darja to milanaa hi chahie, tabhi vahaan kaarkaana lagegaa
 "this middle-aged auto driver hails from Motihari in Bihar, but the sentiments of this man and the crowd gathered in the rally show how Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is able to skillfully put his compulsion on the public tongue
" Have been
 vishesh darje kii maang ko nitish ne aisa jaadui box bana diya he, jisamen ek taraf unhone janata kii ummiido ko puraa nahin kar paane se punap rahe gusse ko band karne kii koshish kii he, to duusari taraf usee main bihar ke behatar bhavishya kii sunahari kalpana bhi dikhaai he
 But what their real goal is, the expression of this is evident by their humorous appeal at Ramlila Maidan, "if they delay in deciding on our demand for special status, then we have to fight
" hamen 2014 ke liye aisi taiyaari kerani hogi ki abhi nahin to uske baad dena hi hoga
 On the leadership of Narendra Modi, the ongoing fighting in the BJP and the declining credibility of the Congress also emphasizes the possibility of a Third Front, in such a situation Nitish is knocking on the doors of Delhi with an issue in which the enemy of the friend and enemy of the enemy The possibility of becoming friends cannot be ruled out
 unhone adhikaar raily main logon se chunaav main zyada siten jitaane kii sidhi apil nahin kii, balki ishaara kiya, ‘‘2014 main hamen na baayen dekhnaa he, na daaen dekhnaa he
 It is only to see that there is such a government in Delhi that understands our pain
 ’’ yani nitish ne ek taraf loksabhaa chunaav main zyada se zyada siten jitaane kaa samarthan maang liya to duusari taraf centre kii satta main kingmekar banane ke mansoobey kaa izhaar bhi kar diya
 However, after a rights rally in Delhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and Finance Minister P

 After these meetings, Nitish looked very confident and said, "from what the Prime Minister has said, there is a clear indication that the matter will move forward, whatever has been said will work on it
" ’’unki bhav-bhangima bihar or centre kii karavat leti raajnneeti kii ore bhi ishaara karti he, kyonki diemke kii samarthan vaapasi kii ghoshnaa ke fouran baad nitish ne kah diya ki centre sarkaar ko koi khatra nahin he or loksabhaa chunaav tay samay par hi honge
 But when asked about the time limit, Nitish left the option open by saying, "how much is the tenure of this government now?" They will have to work on it soon, only then it will get 'benefit'
 ’’haalanki dilli kii siyasat main halchal paidaa karne ke baad patna pahunche nitish ne ek or shigupha chhod apni sahyogi bijepi ke camp main khalabali machaa di
 On the question asked about the future of NDA, Nitish responded to the media in his own special way, "I do not know about this nor you
" bhavishya ke bare main koi kuch nahin kah saktaa
 This was perhaps the first time in a huge rally of an opposing party when issues like corruption, inflation related to the central government were not touched from the platform
 lekin jediu kii taiyaariyon ko bhaanp bijepi bhi ab aakraamak hone lagi he or 17 saal purana gathjod darakta dikh rahaa he
 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, who has once faced accusations of not being very vocal against Nitish within the BJP, is also calling for his 35-year-old relationship with Narendra Modi while speaking in a tone of warning
 adhikaar raily ke nihitarth par susheel modi bhi garaje, ‘‘congress ek duubataa jahaaj he or jo bhi us par sawari karne kii koshish karegaa, vah bhi uske saath dub jayega
 "MP Shatrughan Sinha and Ashwini Choubey, a minister in the Nitish government from BJP quota, also announced that the party has the strength to contest all the 40 seats in the state
" lekin party kii mushkil yah he ki bihar main ab tak ke vikaas kaa shrey jediu lut chuki he
 On the other hand, Union Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs and Planning Rajiv Shukla said immediately after the success of Adhikar Rally, "the Center is doing everything possible for the betterment of Bihar
" bihar ke mukhyamantri kii maangon ke bare main pradhanmantri or vitt mantri na sirf jaanate hai, balki un par vichaar bhi kar rahe hai
 "the Congress is also giving air to the increasing distance from BJP in its style
" khud pradhanmantri ne 6 march ko twit kar bihar ko sabase teji se vikaas kar rahaa rajya bataaya to nitish ne fouran bayaan jari kar aabhaar jataayaa
 After that, on March 9, the Bihar government transferred Bihar Governor Devanand Kunwar to Tripura, the central government tried to appease Nitish, whose relations with the Bihar government were not comfortable
 ab centre sarkaar jald hi pichde rajyon kii paribhaasha or vishesh rajya kaa darja dene ke maapdandon par vichaar ke liye cameti bana sakati he, jise nitish 2014 ke chunaav main nishchit rup se apana ‘trump card’ banaaenge
 Nitish continued his rally at Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Finance Minister P
K
 chidambaram kii shaan main kaside padhakar apni rajnatik manshaa or bhi spasht kar di
 He said, "we have got pleasure from a word of the Center (considering changing the criteria), but let's see if the Center stays on it or not
" ’’ raajnneeti main har pasa phenkane main maahir nitish ne gathbandhan ke is daur main congress ko sashart sahaara dene kaa sapana dikhaaya he taaki bihar main congress phir se lalu-paswan kaa daaman thaamne se parhez kare
 The Congress, which has died in the state, will also enjoy a relationship with Nitish more than Lalu Yadav
 rajya main muslim aabaadi 16
 53 per cent and in the rally, Nitish also asked the Center to work on it as soon as possible, referring to the land provided in the state especially for the Aligarh Muslim University campus

 He says, "this question does not arise
" special darje se political faisle thode hi na honge
 Special state status is an important issue of ours, elections are different
 (dekhen baatcheet)
 Former Bihar Chief Minister and RJD president Lalu Prasad Yadav is also aware of Nitish's strategy
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘nitish kaa graph neeche chalaa gaya he or ab ve chaahate hai ki congress kahin mujhase (lalu se) ti-ap na kar le or duusari taraf bijepi se bhi saudebaaji kar rahe hai ki vah chunaav se pehle narendra modi ko project nahin kare
 He alleges that it was Nitish who prevented then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee from granting special status to Bihar during the NDA rule
 itnaa hi nahin, rajya ko vishesh package ke liye bani cameti kaa adhyaksh hone ke baad bhi nitish ne sahaayta dilaane kii disha main kadam nahin uthaae
 Lalu alleges that Nitish feared that RJD would benefit if Bihar got a package or special status (see talk)

 RJD chief Lalu Yadav believes that this is a political demand and they will not be separated from the NDA

 However, Nitish has realized his political power with this maneuver

 lekin is maamle main to vipaksh sidhe sansad main charchaa karaane kii maang kar rahaa he

 Leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitley rejected the government's claim of increasing telecom density, saying that increasing telecom density does not mean that the exchequer is harmed
 unhone kaha ki kuch logon ne doorsanchaar kshetra kii safalataa ko ghotaale main tabdeel kar diya he

 unhone kaha ki sarkaar kii nitiyon ke kaaran telephone kii daren sasti huin, is ore bhi dhyaan diya janaa chahie
 bsp's Brajesh Pathak said that the proposal for formation of JPC has come after a lot of struggle and he hopes that it will come to some conclusion
 makapa ke tapan kumaar sen ne is prastaav ko ‘‘der aae durust aae’ qaraar dete hue kaha ki sarkaar agar pehle sahamat ho gayi hoti to sansad kaa ek satr barbaad nahin hota

 AIADMK k v Maitreyan demanded that his party be included in the JPC, and said that we have been raising this issue for the last two years

 ab aapaki selary parjiastika asar dikhne ja rahaa he? iconomic times ne daawa kiya he ki is asar ke chalate deshbhar kii companiyaan apane karmchaariyon ke selary package main bade badlaav kii taiyaari main hai kyonki ab karmchaaree kii selary kaa brallep companiyon par baari padegaa
 This will be another major setback after the shopping and restaurant bill
 house rent, mobile or telephone bill, health insurance, medical bill, transportesan jaise selary kaa brallep yadi jiesti ke daayre main aa jayega to companiyon ko aapaki selary package ko nae sire se nirdhaarit karnaa hoga
 Taxpayers have started advising companies to ask their HR department to understand the employee's salary breakup afresh
 gauratlab he ki athurity of advance ruling (eear) ke haal main die ek faisle ke baad companiyaan karmchaaree kii selary ko lekar sajag ho gai hai or vah apni tex dendaree bachaane ke liye nae selary brallep par kaam kar rahi hai
 It is worth noting that AAR has decided in a special case that the deduction from the salary of the employee in the name of canteen charges by companies will be within the purview of GST
 is faisle ke baad jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki companiyon dwaara karmchaariyon kii di ja rahi kai suvidhaayen jiske aivaj main selary main katautee kii jaati he ko jiesti ke daayre main kar diya jayega
 Currently, companies used to prepare salary package to the employee on a cost to company basis and many services are deducted on the basis of the salary
 lekin ab yadi ise jiesti ke daayre main liya jaataa he to companiyaan kisi karmchaaree kii cost tu company ko hi aadhaar rakhte hue uske brallep main badlaav karengi jisase company kii tex dendaree par koi prabhaav na pade
 According to tax experts, the salary of the employees includes many breakups in which the companies provide services and the employees were paid without any receipt in return for these services
 iske chalate tex vibhaag ke liye in sevaaon par jiesti kaa anumaan lagaana mushkil hota he or companiyaan apni suvidha par apana tex bachaane ke liye karmchaariyon kii selary brallep taiyaar karti hai
 Therefore, if the services provided by the company to the employee fall under the GST, then the efforts of the companies also add the country GST to the employee's cost to the company, so that its tax liability is not affected

 'ramdev had said that the POK which Pakistan has occupied in India should be merged with India
 vahaan jitne bhi aatanki shivi chal rahe hai unhen dhwast kiya janaa chahie
 He said that the rebels within Pakistan should help India and revolt against them and Pakistan should be completely demolished
 agar aisa nahin kiya gaya to pakistan apni napak harakat band nahin karegaa
 'ramdev said that till now we have lost more than 50 thousand soldiers and civilians and this is a great sting and pain for India
 ek shaktishaalee desh ne pakistan kii napak gatividhiyon ke kaaran apane 50 hajaar laagon ko khoyaa he

 The yoga guru had said that the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya is not a political issue, but is a matter related to the country's identity

 He had said that Rama is the identity of the nation
 ram raashtra kii maryaada he, vah hamaari aacharan kii shreshthata he
 Ram is the ancestor of both Hindus and Muslims, so religion does not come forward
 ram mandir to bananaa hi chahie or ram mandir banane ke saath saath ram or sita jaisaa charitra bhi bane
 The character of the Ram temple and the nation will be built, then in the true sense, the kingdom of Ram will come in the country
 ' unhone kaha tha ki kumbh main tay hua ki ram mandir par sara raashtra ek he
 We should be one on big issues and the whole nation should be one
 ram ke naam par bantwaaraa nahin hona chahie

 The court has ordered that the charges of sedition and attempt to murder against 53 accused be dropped from the FIR
 kyonki police ke paas in aaropon ko sabit karne ke liye paryaapt saboot nahin hai
 However, the court made it clear that the cases of sedition and criminal conspiracy against Hahnipreet Insan, Aditya Insan and others will continue

 The court said in its order that the police had also imposed Section 307 of the IPC against the accused, but the case of violence on August 25 does not prove that any policeman or other is in danger of life
 maamle kii jaanch kar rahi esaiti aropiyon ke khilaaf lagaae gaye deshadroh ke aarope bhi sabit nahin kar pai
 The defense lawyers had told the court that the police could not record CCTV footage related to the case or present facts that could prove treason charges

 Significantly, the violence erupted in Panchkula after Gurmeet Ram Rahim, the head of Dinadera Sacha Sauda on 25 August last year, was convicted in a rape case
 jisamen 34 logon kii maut ho gai thi
 In order to investigate these riots, the police had made more than 8 SIT teams and presented the challan in the court

 On the arrival of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in Varanasi, JDU activists fiercely put up posters
 is dauraan ek poster aisa bhi lagaaya gaya, jisamen nitish kumaar ko arjuna or sharad yadav ko krishna dikhaaya gaya
 Attack on BJP in the poster: In this poster Modi government was also attacked
 poster main centre sarkaar par aarope lagaaya gaya he ki wo sampradayikta failaakar desh main araajaktaa kaa maahaul bana rahi he
 It has also said that the declaration of 'war' against corruption in Uttar Pradesh
 yaduwanshi samaaj se hai sharad yadavajediu ke pravaktaa avanish singh ne kaha ki yah poster sangh mukt bharat ke liye banaaya gaya he
 Sharad Yadav is from the Yaduvanshi society and is shown as the charioteer Krishna and Nitish Kumar as Arjuna
 modi sarkaar par jamkar barase nitishabihar ke mukhyamantri guuruuvaar ko pradhanmantri ke sansadeey kshetra varanasi pahunche
 Nitish Kumar is residing in Varanasi on 12 and 13 May
 13 may ko dashashwamegh ghat par ganga saptami yojit kaarykram main shirkat karenge
 During his address here, he raised the issue of prohibition of alcohol from the stage
 modi or bijepi ko nishane par lete hue unhone sawaal kiya ki pradhanmantri bijepi shasit rajyon main sharaab par pabandi kyon nahin lagaate
 Not only this, he also accused the BJP of cheating the public and vandalism
 bihar main chamaki bukhaar (acute Encephalitis Syndrome) se ab tak 150 bacchon kii maut ho gayi he
 Certainly Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is getting the most criticism on this issue
 uske baad up mukhyamantri susheel modi jo vipaksh ke netaa ke rup main kisi bhi ghatana ke baad sabase aakraamak hoke istifa maangate the
 After all, the state health minister Mangal Pandey, who has become a joke due to his insensitivity, is getting criticized
 ye teenon netaa media se pareshaan hai kyonki media vaale inkaa peechha karte hai or kuch to inase inhen ke purv ke bayano kaa hawala dete hue puch dete hai ki akhir istifa kab denge
 The media, especially in electronic media for many days from morning to evening in prime time, is critical of the government with a single voice from the journalist to the editor of the channel on legitimate points in the pretext of the infirmity of hospitals
 lekin bihar ke sattarudh janata dal united kaa kahana he ki media ne aalochana kii aad main yaa to patrakaron ko is beemaari ke naam par apana vyaktitv badhaane yaa channel kaa agenda keval nitish kumaar ke chhavi ko dhoomil karne kii he or is prayaas main janata dal united ke mukhya pravaktaa sanjay singh kii maane to ab kuch channel bhashaa kii maryaada or or patrakarita ke saare maapdand ko taak par rakhkar gaali galoch par utar aae hai
 According to Sanjay Singh, the way some channel journalists made ICU their news studio and some editors used language and words like Hindi to English from the news studio, it is not sensitivity towards their children but Bihar Chief Minister Nitish under an agenda There was a smell of political intrigue to spoil Kumar's face
 shivanand kaa kahana heki jo channel nitish kumaar ke kilaaf sabase zyaada aakraamak hai unka pichley kuch varshon kaa itihaas uthaa ke dekh lijie ki kya unhone bhaajapa sarkaar kilaaf aisi bhashaa or shabdon ke prayog kiye hai
 In Gorakhpur too, when the children died, see what was their line
 lekin sanjay singh ke paas nishchit rup se is baat kaa jawaab nahin ki akhir unke netaa is mudde par media se kanni kyon kaat rahe hai
 But his cleaning is that he should keep an eye on the situation or get involved with the media
 vahiin rashtriya janata dal jiske apane khud ke netaa tejasvi yadav kaa is puure prakaran main maun unki party ke pareshaani kaa kaaran bana hua he
 Its senior leader Shivanand Tiwari says that we are also shocked that the BJP and the BJP and the editor who dance on the finger of the BJP are working on the Muzaffarpur episode, especially the aggressive Nitish Kumar
 In a way, they are being warned that you should stay within your limits, otherwise you can go to any extent in destroying the capital of the image
 Huh
 haalanki shivanand tiwari kaa kahana hai ki nitish khud itane paripakv netaa hai jo aalochana or agenda main farq or koun kisase nirdeshit hota hai sab jaanate hai
 On the other hand, former Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi reacted to the statements of the children and family members in Muzaffarpur and said that the misbehavior by Nitish Kumar with the media is indecent
 unhone kaha ki media ko bhi apane dayera or maryaada kaa paalan karnaa chahie
 Manjhi said that in Muzaffarpur, most of the poor are still underprivileged and the last rung has died
 maut par afsos vyakt karte hue unhone kaha ki samay rahete bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko janaa chahie tha
 Nitish Kumar is showing the media a way out to hide his shortcomings
 haal ke dinon main jo haal bihar kaa rahaa he
 Certainly, the Chief Minister of the state tells the picture of the good governance of Nitish Kumar
 puri tarah satta evam shashan khokhla ho chukaa he
 But the leaders of Janata Dal United say that after all if the media is working in the hospital or showing some deficiencies
 kyonki sarkaar ne media ko ye swatantraaa di hui he anyathaa kya yahi desh or bihar ke media vaale kisi anya rajya main dilli ho yaa mumbai ho,lakhanu yaa bhopal kisi sarkari yaa nijee aspataal main ICU to chhodiye kya general ward se bhi aisi reporting kar sakate hai
 He says that certainly a lot could have been done, there must have been some loss that resulted in death, which is sad for everyone, but for this, show the language of abuse in its prime time in the name of criticism, then where is this journalism
 vahiin media jagat ke jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki is puure mudde par nitish kumaar or unki sarkaar kii aalochana lazimi he
 There are many such steps as late health minister Mangal Pandey or Chief Minister Nitish Kumar visited the hospital in Muzaffarpur, where he invited his criticism in a way
 iske alaava paryaapt sankhya main doctoron kaa naa hona wo bhi ek aisa mudda tha jahaan agar shuruyaat main faisalaa liya hota to kai bacchon kii jaan batch sakati thi
 All these issues are where criticism is justified
 lekin saath-saath swasthya mantri mangal pandeya kaa puure seen se nadaarad rahanaa yaa centre sarkaar kii apane ghoshnaa jaise 2014 main mujaffarpur aspataal ke liye kiye gaye ghoshnaa ho yaa bihar main duusare AIIMS kii sthapana ho
 It is certainly not digestible to ignore all these issues from the agenda
 jis ayushmaan yojana kaa piem modi ne puure chunaav main dhindhora peeta tha usko bhi mujffarpur main thik se lagu nahin kiya gaya
 The Indians, however, did not give up and continued the attack and the next minute resulted in a penalty corner
 rupinder ne ise gol main badalakar maahaul phir jeevant kar diya
 Belgium, however, returned in the 57th minute thanks to a goal from Cedric Charlier and pushed the match towards a shootout
 shootout main match kaa faisla nahin hone par 'sadan deth' kaa sahaara liya gaya tha
 Jharkhand Olympic Association working president RK Anand on Thursday claimed that he has not committed any corruption in the 34th National Games in Jharkhand and all the disturbances that have taken place in spite of his opposition from the then Madhu Koda government were hastily made by the purchases

 kitaab kaa cover kahata he ki ise aath saal se zyada umr ke bachche pard sakate hai
 But its story is so tied that what eight, you will like it even at the age of eighty
 'suraayaaj gift' apane bheetar kai kahaniyon ko samete hue he
 Aunty Leela gives 9-year-old Suraya a notebook in which the story she writes becomes true
 antee kahati hai ki acchhee kahaniyon kaa asar acha hoga or buree kaa bura
 Suraya writes good-bad stories in her notebook with her understanding and imagination and the stories around them become true one by one
 phir ek din suraayaa kii story kachar ho jaati he gaayab or use pataa chalata he is jaadu ke peeche kaa sach
 The author of 'har Kahaani Amar Hai' has shown the fertile mind of a girl through the stories written by her
 mukhya kahani ke andar choti-choti kahaniyaan bhar di gai hai jo kitaab ke plot main aasaani se feet ho jaati hai
 The story begins with Suraya's dream and ends with her dream
 sapane, asal zindagi or galp ke bich kahani is tarah tairti rahati he ki kabhi-kabhi teenon main bhed karnaa mushkil hota he
 This side of the story sounds exactly like a child's mind - full of fantasies
 sapanom kii hi tarah hi kahaniyaan bhi samay kii simaaon se pare hai
 When Suraya wrote a bad story for a boy one day, that boy got very bad
 tab suraayaa ko gilt hua or usne kahaniyaan likhnaa band kar diya
 Natraj has shown this to be easy for a child to believe in stories, the more that belief is broken
 story kachar ke jariye wo ye bhi bataati hai ki duniya main kahi, likhi, sochi gai har ek kahani khaas he
 Every story is recorded somewhere and is immortal
 agar hamen apni kahaniyon par yakeen ho to ve asal duniya ko bhi badal sakati hai
 Why read like this book is written for your children
 par kahaniyaan sunne yaa likhane main ruchi ho to aap bhi zarur padhein
 The book will take you away from 'serious' and 'popular' to an innocent world
 kitaab ke sundar chitron ko banaaya he 'tu nion studio' ne
 From the children's perspective, it will inspire them to write and read
 unke kalpana bhare dimag ko gudagudi karegi

 But the central government should tell the hospital to open its gates, do not refuse people
 ames or safadarajang ko ab kisi ko manaa nahin karnaa chahie

 The claims of the government regarding the reduction in the number of DTC buses and the continuously decreasing passengers are being questioned, in which the government talks about improving public transport
 paryaavaran ke liye kaam karne vaale enjio centre for science and anvyrement ne ek research report ke hawaale se daawa kiya he ki pichley paanch saal main ditisi main safar karne vaale musafiron kii sankhya main baari kami ai he or ditisi kii bason main safar karne vaale musafir 35 fisadi tak kam ho gaye hai
 Not only this, Delhi currently needs 11 thousand buses, compared to that the number of buses in Delhi is around five thousand, while by 2020 Delhi's requirement will increase to 15 thousand buses
 enjio ke in aankadon ke baad vipaksh nedillisarkaar ko katghare main khadaa kiya he or sarkaar se jawaab maanga he ki uske daavon ke ulat in aankadon kii sachai kya he
 Leader of the Opposition Vijendra Gupta has demanded the Delhi government to issue a white paper on the Center for Science and Environment's report on the DTC
 unhone kaha ki is report main ditisi ke kuprabandhan ko lekar kai gambhir sawaal uthaae gaye hai
 The government is silent on this
 sarkaar ko isamen lagaae gaye aaropon kaa jawaab dena hoga or bataanaa hoga ki rajdhani kii saarvajanik bas seva kii itani kharaab haalat kyon hui or sarkaar isko durust karne main kya kadam uthaane ja rahi he?vijendra gupta ne report main uthaae gaye muddon par dilli sarkaar ko aade haathon liya
 The Leader of the Opposition said that the Kejriwal government had proved to be a miserable failure to provide reliable and robust traffic system through the DTC to the residents of Delhi during its twenty-three-year tenure
 2011-12 ke baad ab tak koi bas nahin kharidi gai
 According to EPCA, if this is the case then by 2025 DTC will be empty

 inamen se 1 hajaar bason ke liye 30 november tak tender aamantrit kiye jane the, lekin aaj tak tender bhi jari nahin ho paae
 Vijender Gupta said that it is a matter of concern that every day 700 buses stand idle in the depots, because they need to be repaired and maintained
 kisi bhi shahar ke liye itani badi sankhya main bason kaa depo main khadaa rahanaa bataata he ki vahaan kii sarkaar saarvajanik yatayaat vyavastha ke prati kitni gambhir he

 co / by9pw1fuug loksabhaa chunaav 2019 se ain pehle modi sarkaar ne savarna samudaay kii naaraazgi ko dur karne ke liye 10 fisadi savarna aarakshan kaa daanv chalaa he
 Just before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government inducted Jats and minorities into the Jat OBC category
 5 fisadi aarakshan dene kaa elaan kiya tha, lekin chunavi ran main use siyaasi phayda nahin mila tha
 In such a situation, will the Modi government's upper caste reservation card be able to return to power? In fact, the upper caste castes are being considered angry with the amendment made by the Modi government to bring the SC-ST Act to its old form
 haal hi main hue vidhansabha chunaav main savarna jatiyon kii naaraazgi ke chalate madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main satta gavanni padi
 Whereas the upper caste castes are considered the traditional vote bank of the BJP
 iske baavjood unhone bijepi ke khilaaf jaakar vot diya or nota kaa bhi istemaal kiya
 About 12 lakh votes were cast in NOTA in three states
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke maddenjar savarna samudaay ko saadhane kii ranneeti ke tahat modi sarkaar ne trump card ke taur par garib savarnon ko 10 fisadi aarakshan dene kii kavayad kar rahi he
 Opposing the upper caste reservation, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav from the opposition has demanded to increase the scope of reservation for the obcs
 modi sarkaar main mantri or apana dal kii netaa anupriya patel ne bhi tejasvi ke sur main sur milaayaa he
 Apart from this, the rest of the parties are in support of reservation, but for the BJP, these stakes may not backfire
 upie sarkaar ne loksabhaa chunaav kii ghoshnaa se thik pehle 4 march, 2014 ko jari ek adhisuchana ke jariye dilli, uttar pradesh, uttarakhand, rajasthan, bihar, madhya pradesh, haryana, gujarat, himachal pradesh ke jaaton ko obisi kii kendriya suchi main shaamil kar liya tha
 It was on this basis that the Jats got reservation under the OBC quota in central government jobs and higher education institutions, but in the political battle of elections, the Jat community stood with the BJP rather than the Congress
 iskaa nateeja rahaa ki jat bahul loksabhaa siton par congress ko karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa
 Not only this, the upa's ally and the Rashtriya Lok Dal, doing their politics around the Jats, were badly defeated
 choudhary ajit singh or unke bete jayant choudhary ko bhi haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa tha
 However, the Jat reservation was later rejected by the Supreme Court
 pichhali upie sarkaar ne jat hi nahin balki alpsankhyakon ko 4
 Had announced to give 5 percent reservation
 lekin upie kaa ye faisla bhi adaalat main nahin tik sakaa
 The main reason for not getting tick in the court is the lack of solid data and fresh survey
 darasal, jati aadhaarit janaganana ke aankade sarkaar ke paas hai to par usne inhen saarvajanik nahin kiya he
 Apart from this, the Constitution does not mention reservation on economic grounds
 aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan dene ke liye samvidhan sanshodhan karne ke liye sarkaar kadam uthaa rahi he
 In view of the Lok Sabha elections, except one of the two regional parties, the remaining parties will be seen standing with this step of the government
 aise hi 2014 main jat aarakshan ke paksh main bhi sabhi saath the, lekin chunaav main modi ko saath milegaa ye to 2019 main pataa chalegaa

 com / 6hcjnsku44 bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ne lakhanu main vijay shankhanaad raily main modi ne kaha ki abhi to bijepi kii lahar he or chunaav ghoshit hote hi yah tsunami ban jaaegi
 He said that this time the destruction of SP, BSP and Congress i
e
 'everybody' is certain
 modi ne kaha ki sapa pramukh mulaayam singh yadav gujarat ko lekar jhooth failaa rahe hai
 Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of crimes in the country
 sapa sukhwadi, samaaj virdohi party he
 Modi said that because of us, there is talk of development
 modi ne kaha, lohia kaa naam lenaa band karen mulaayam
 Modi said that to hide their failures, non-bjp parties are pushing for secularism and misleading people, this is just their election slogan
 sapa mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav vikaas ke maamle main gujarat se tulana na karen
 More than 100 riots took place under the rule of his son, while leave a single riot in Gujarat in 10 years, curfew was not imposed
 modi ne kaha, hamaare liye dharmanirpekshata kaa matlab he 'india first'
 Their 'secularism' is only an election slogan, our 'secularism' is secularism
 unki dharmanirpekshata keval logon ko daraana he, lekin hamaara 'secularism
 
 
 It is the article of faith, connecting people and developing
 jo log hamen lalkaarte hai, unhen meri lalkaar he
 
 
 "the insistence of thunderstorms is where there is lightning, i also have the stubbornness to create the same desires
 
 
 " Trying to touch the heart of the Muslims with a sarcasm on the Uttar Pradesh government, Modi said, "hajat Yatra is the wish of every Muslim
" gujarat main har varsh sirf 4800 logon ko kota diya he, lekin jab arji mangavate hai, to gujarat main 38 hajaar argiyaan aati hai or secularism kii revadiyaan baantne vaale logon ke raaj main 32 hajaar ke cote main argiyaan sirf aati hai 35 hajaar
 He said, if the economic condition of the Muslims here was good, it would not have received so few applications
 netaji (mulaayam singh yadav) aapane musalamaanon ko vot kaa tukdaa hi samajhakar rakhaa he
 Modi appealed to the people of Lucknow not to let their culture go to waste
 unhone kaha ki agar aapako desh kii takadir badalani he, to isaki shuruyaat nishchit rup se lakhanu se honi chahie
 The Ramabai Ambedkar Maidan in Lucknow was closed seven days ago in view of the terror attack in Modi's rally in Patna
 raily ke liye suraksha ke pukhta intjaam kiye gaye
 The rally venue was decorated with bjp's flag-banners and in the backdrop of the stage a huge portrait of former Prime Minister and senior party leader Atal Bihari Bajpayee, a five-time MP from Lucknow, was put up
 desh kii rajdhani dilli main metro yatayaat kaa ek bahut lokapriy saadhan he, or rozaana lakhon log isse safar karte hai
 After the arrival of the metro in Delhi, the convenience of commuting has definitely increased, but if carelessness is taken, then the journey of the metro can also be very dangerous
 aisa hi ek maamla guuruuvaar ko saamne aayaa, jo metro main suraksha par sawaal khadey karata he
 The doors of a metro train running on the route from Gurgaon to Jahangirpuri (delhi) were not closed on Thursday morning and the train continued to run without risking the lives of hundreds of passengers
 subah lagbhag 9:40 baje arjangadh stesan se ravaanaa hote vakt tak train ke bain ore ke darvaaze band nahin ho paae the, or vah na sirf chal di, balki puri raftaar pakadakar agle stesan ghitorani tak pahunch bhi gai, lekin darvaaze band nahin hue
 Till the train did not stop at Ghitorni, there was panic among the passengers, there was panic, but there is no news of an accident by luck
 haalanki ghitorani stesan par pahunchakar jab metro prashasan or train ke chaalak staff ko galati kaa ehsaas hua, metro ko stesan par hi lagbhag 15-20 minute tak roke rakhaa gaya
 Prima facie it is believed to be the fault of the train operator, and he is suspended with immediate effect
 jangalraj ke sawaal par lalu bole ki bihar main pichhadon kaa raaj aane se darane vaale log is tarah kii baaten kar rahe hai ki jangalraj aa rahaa he
 The seven most powerful countries in the world have vowed together that they will surround ISIS and close it in seven doors
 phir uskaa namonishaan mitaa denge
 This is a chakravyuh of seven doors which has succeeded, then just understand that the story of ISIS will end
 phir iske baad naa bagdadi hoga or naa hi bagdadi ke belgaum aatankwaadi
 63 countries of the world, led by America, have already opened a front against IS
 ab duniya ke sabase taqatvar saat mulkon ne nae sire seissko barbaad karne kii kasam khai he
 Under this oath, all the seven countries will now target every hideout of ISIS where its presence will be a little clunky

 He said that if both countries do not resolve this difference bilaterally, then they have other option as per the 1960 Indus Water Treaty
 pakistani videsh mantri ne kaha, ‘hamaare bich ek bahut acchhee sandhi he or mujhe nahin lagata ki hamen isse dur hatana chahie

 dilli vishvavidhyalay kaa vibhaagadhyaksh pad is lihaaj se unki kirti main kuch jodta nahin he
 But for the University of Delhi, it is no less than a bad reputation that it is trying to avoid the historic opportunity to make a Dalit head of the department for the first time

 Shyouraj Singh is a restless liberal writer
 ve dalit andolanon ko sahanubhuti ke saath dekhte rahe hai, lekin bahut aakraamak dhang se uskaa hissaa nahin rahe hai

 But perhaps even challenging the Dalit identity has not been so easy
 shyoraj singh baichaiyn ko nyaay dilaane ke liye log ekajute ho rahe hai
 a symbolic march was also held at Delhi University on Monday
 jaahir he, der-saber shyoraj singh baichaiyn ko unka adhikaar dena hoga
 But if Delhi University can do this work with respect, then its dignity will also increase, the trust of Dalit identity will also increase
