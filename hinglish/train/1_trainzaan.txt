 chalan main bane rahane ke liye company ne glass or gradient dizine vaale plastic par bharosa jataayaa he
 The upgrade to this design began with the Redmi Note 7 series
 ab nayaa Redmi 7 bhi isi dizine langvej se prerit lagata he
 It is not that Redmi 7 has changed only in terms of design
 company ne kifayati daam kaa tamgaa barkaraar rakhte hue kai hardware ko apgrade bhi kiya he
 We spent some time with Redmi 7 at the launch event of Xiaomi
 pehali nazar main hamen yah handset kaisaa laga? aaie bataate hai
 
 
 Redmi 7 is made from glossy plastic
 yah un yuzar ko nahin pasand aayega jo metalik body ke diwane hai
 Xiaomi has signed the deal to give the Redmi 7 a beautiful gradient finish
 Xiaomi ne ise ora smoke dizine kaa naam diya he
 According to us, it looks more beautiful than the metallic finish of the old Redmi phone
 Redmi 7 ke do gradient color vikalp hai- lunar red or comet blue
 There is also an Eclipse Black variant
 hamaare hisaab se lunar red verient dikhne main sabase khubasurat tha
 Smokey Black and Red Gradient takes a look
 Redmi 7 behad hi compect smartphone he
 The edges are curved keeping in mind the convenience
 Xiaomi ke mutabik, divaais pi2ai hydrophobic coating ke saath aata he
 That is, it is protected from minor water splashes
 Xiaomi ne front panel par bhi nae dizine kaa istemaal kiya he
 The wide bezel of the Redmi 6 has been discharged
 company kam bezal vaale disple ke saath waterdrop noch diya he
 6 in the phone
 26 inch kaa echdi+ (720x1520 picksal) disple panel ke saath aata he, 19
 With 5: 9 aspect ratios
 yah corning gorilla glass 5 kii protection ke saath aata he
 This feature is not seen in this price range
 hamane paaya ki disple wibrant tha or vuing angel bhi badhiya tha
 But it was a bit reflective in Indoor
 ham is phone ko suraj kii roshni main istemaal nahin kar paae
 This phone has also been upgraded in the hardware department
 speed or multitasking ke liye 1
 There is an 8 ghz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 processor
 yah handset do ram vikalp main aata he- 2 jibi or 3 jibi
 The only storage option is 32 GB
 donon hi verient main 512 jibi tak ke microesady card ke liye saport he
 Xiaomi has given two nano SIM slots in this phone and a separate slot for the microsd card
 iskaa matlab he ki yuzar ko duusare sim or microesady card main se ek ko nahin chunanaa padegaa
 The battery of this device is 4,000 mah
 yaad rahe ki puraane verient Redmi 6 ko 3,000 eme kii bydaree ke saath utaara gaya tha
 Now talk about camera setup
 Redmi 7 main photography ke liye do rier camere die gaye hai, 12 megapixl kaa primary sensor or 2 megapixl kaa secondary sensor
 An 8-megapixel front camera has been provided for the selfie
 iske alaava yah handset eai smart beauty, selfi timer or phase analock jaise feechar se las he
 We did not get much time to assess the capability of the phone's camera
 hamane selfi lene ke liye palm shater gescher ko istemaal kiya, yah kaam karata he
 Redmi 7 runs on MIUI 10 based on Android 9 Pie
 divaais ke saath bitaye gaye simit samay hamane paaya ki eps ke bich switch karnaa behad hi smooth tha
 We had no problem with the user interface
 7,999 rupee kii shuruaati keemat vaala Redmi 7 pehali nazar main paisa vasuul handset lagata he
 This is an upgrade of Redmi 6 in many cases
 keemat ko dekhte hue kaha ja saktaa he ki redmy 7 kii bhidnt Samsung Galaxy M10 (rivyuu) or Realme 3 (rivyuu) se hogi
 On paper, Redmi 7 seems to be a powerful alternative
 lekin is handset par ham apana aakhri faisla vistrut rivyuu main sunaayenge

 jurmaanajab se nayaa motor whical act lagu hua he, lagaataar zyada chaalaan kaatane ke maamle saamne aa rahe hai
 Ignoring traffic rules is affecting people's pockets
 har jagah trephic police kii sakhti or chaalaan se log sadakon par ab sanbhal ke chal rahe hai phir bhi rashtriya rajdhani dilli main ausat rup se ek din main 5,000 chaalaan kaate ja rahe hai
 These figures are after the formation of the new Motor Vehicle Act
 dilli main sabhi chaalaan court ke jariye ho rahe hai kyonki abhi tak dilli sarkaar ne is disha main notification jari nahin kiya he
 Strict action is being taken against those who violate traffic rules in the capital Delhi
 dilli trephic police kaa kahana he ki 1 se 5 sitambar 2019 tak ausat chaalaan 4000 se 5000 pratidin ho gaya he
 The average number of drunken driving cases so far has been 252, 1,229 without seat belts, 4,097 without helmets and a total of 1527 cases of dangerous driving

 These days, Krishna Kumar in Bihar's Vaishali district is distressed to find laborers for his dairy project
 unki shikaayat he ki pichley kuch saal main is ilaake main mehnat-majuri karne vaale nahin milte
 But why did it happen? He blames the state government for this and says, "people have started drinking too much
 2006 tak is ilaake kii 16 panchayaton main sharaab kii sirf ek dukaan thi, ab paanch dukaane hai
 The state government has made liquor shopping easier
 ” sharaab kii dukaane sirf vaishali jile main hi nahin, balki puure rajya main bahutayat main khul gai hai
 According to government figures, the number of liquor shops in Bihar in 2002-03 was 3,095 which increased to 5,467 by 2013-14
 yani pichley 10 vitt varsh main 2,372 nai dukaane khuli hai jo chaunkaane vaala ausat dikhaata he—bihar main har duusare din sharaab kii ek nai dukaan khuli he
 The largest number of liquor shops grew in rural areas
 vahaan 2006-07 main inaki sankhya 779 se teen guni badhkar 2,360 ho gai he
 Alcohol sales have increased even faster
 desi sharaab kii khapat chaar guna bad gai he jabaki desh main nirmit videshi sharaab (iemfel) kii bikri paanch guna or bear kii khapat 11 guna se adhik bad gai he
 Not surprisingly, the excise duty (excise revenue) of Bihar was also Rs 248 crore in 2002-03
 se 2012-13 main 2,765 karod ru
 Has jumped is tarah exise duty 40 pratishat vaarshik vruddhi ke saath rajya ke khajaane main badhotaree karne vaala ahm kaarak ban gai he
 The share of excise duty in Bihar's tax revenue increased from 10% five years ago to about 18% in 2012-13
 duusari ore, duusari madon jaise cells tex main isi avadhi main giravat ai he
 So, what does this new trend say? The state government's excise policy changed when Nitish Kumar was sworn in as the chief minister of the JD (U) and the BJP alliance
 sarkaar ne rajasav main ijaphe ke liye sharaab kii dukaanon ke liye license fees badhaakar atirikt dukaane kholane kii ijaajat di
 The importance of excise duty is quite different from a heavily industrialized state like Haryana for which industrialization is very less in Bihar
 haryana main bhi sharaab kii khapat bahut zyada he
 There was no response to calls and emails from Sandeep Pundarik, Secretary, State Excise and Liquor Department and Excise Commissioner Syed Parvez Alam, for comments on Bihar's excise policy
 jedy (you) ke mahasachiv shivanand tiwari ne mana ki rajya main sharaab kii khapat badi he
 He says, "in festivals like Holi, people are using more alcohol than traditional cannabis and hemp
 ” lekin ve rajya kii aabkaari niti kaa bachaav karte hai
 They state that before 2005, 80 per cent of the liquor business was outside the purview of tax
 ve kehete hai, “sharaab ke dhandhe ko sangathit rup dene se rajasav main ijapha hua he
 BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi, who was the deputy chief minister of the state till the break-up of the JD (U) alliance last year, agrees
 ve kehete hai, “rajasav main ijapha 2005 ke baad samaan aabkaari tex dhaanche main vyavasthaagat parivartan se hua
 “now the state government allocates liquor shops through lottery
 lottery ke bina koi license nahin diya jaataa he
 a group license is given for two-three shops in an area where the sale of both foreign and domestic liquor is required
 license fees bhi kaaphi he
 The liquor shopkeepers of Buxar say that they get 8 for their two home liquor and one foreign liquor store every month
 45 lakh ru
 License fees

 17 lakh from Rs

 He says, "apart from paying many taxes for the restaurant, i will not be able to increase the sales so much that i can pay more
 ”har taraf aalochanasharab kii bikri se rajya ke khajaane main paisa jarur aa rahaa he lekin sarkaar ko saamaajik kaaryakartaaon or shikshavidon kii aalochana kaa bhi shikaar hona padaa he
 Critics say that the revenue-raising model that increases alcohol sales affects people's health and the status of women as most of society still remains feudal
 vaishali ke deyari maalik kumaar kehete hai ki kushal or adrdhakushal naujavaanon ke liye rojgaar kaa abhaav he kyonki rajnatik ichhashakti kii kami, afasarshahi kii jakadaaa or bhrashtachar kii vajah se bade yaa laghu udyog lag hi nahin paae hai
 He says, "this is causing disappointment especially among rural youth
 ve kheti yaa mehnat kaa kaam nahin karnaa chaahate
 Many such people meet the administration of the village and take money for welfare schemes and loot it on liquor
 ”jahanabad ke saamaajik kaaryakarta sanjay kumaar kehete hai ki sarkari ‘khayraat’ se gramin ilaakon main sharaab kii khapat bad rahi he
 They cite the families below the poverty line who spend Rs 155 each month
 main 15 kilo chaaval or 25 kilo gehun paa jate hai
 In this way the man of these families Rs 100 or 120 prati din kii mazdooree par maheene main paanch se das din bhi kaam paa jaataa he to vah sharaab par use uda detaa he
 (people drunken on New Year's Eve after midnight in a hotel in Patna) The state's new excise policy was implemented in July 2007
 iskaa uddeshy sharaab mafia kaa varchasv khatm karke zyada se zyada sharaab kii dukaane kholana or is tarah sharaab pine ke zyada avasar muhaiyaa karana tha
 It also allowed domestic and foreign liquor to open in gram panchayats and drink liquor in the same premises
 ab haalat yah he ki rajya main awasaiya ilaakon ke alaava dharmik or shaikshik sansthaaon ke paas bhi sharaab kii dukaane khul gai hai
 The liberal excise policy has not only made liquor easily available everywhere but has also caused a lot of problems
 daaru ke nashe main log gali-mohalle main hangaamaa karte hai or kanoon-vyavastha kii samasya paidaa karte hai
 But there is a ray of hope
 pichley hafte rajya sarkaar ne patna hycourt ko aashwaasan diya ki 31 janvari ke baad shaikshik sansthaanon ke paas daaru kii dukaan kholane kii ijaajat nahin di jaaegi
 The High Court had said that if liquor shops were found at these places, the officer giving them the license would be held guilty
 sanyogvash, bihar aabkaari kanoon main praavdhaan he ki kisi bhi ilaake main daaru kii dukaan kholane se pehle sthaneey logon ko iske bare main suchit kiya jayega or unki sahmati lee jaaegi
 It also lists places where these shops cannot open, such as bathing ghats, educational and religious institutions, hospitals, petrol pumps, railway stations and laborers' settlements etc
 lekin bihar ne rajya main daaru kii dukaan kaa license dene ke maamle main hameshaa in praavdhaanon kaa ulanghan kiya he
 Kanhaiya Singh, senior fellow at the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER), a think tank in New Delhi, says higher excise duty and license fees can lead to increased adulteration and black marketing, especially in the case of domestic liquor
 baxur ke saamaajik kaaryakarta shiv prakaash raay kehete hai ki license fees or sharaab kii keemat badhaakar sarkaar yah dharna banane kii koshish kar rahi he ki isse sharaab kii khapat kam hogi lekin vah dukaanon ke atirikt license bhi to jari kar rahi he
 He says, "we have to understand this screw
 ” kuch jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki aabkaari se milane vaale rajasav ko buraai kaa dhan maananaa chahie isliye sharaab par tex badhanaa koi galat nahin he
 Shaibal Gupta, member secretary of Patna's Asian Development Research Institute, says, "the state needs its own revenue and excise is the area in which rates can be increased and revenue can also be widened
 ”lekin kuch duusare log aisi kar pranali par sawaal uthaate hai jisamen aabkaari rajasav main sabase zyada ijapha ho rahaa he
 Pranab Sen, the former chief numerologist of the country, believes that the excise duty increase of 7 per cent in total revenue is quite high
 ve kehete hai, “yah kisi bhi rajya ke liye chintaa kii baat he kyonki aabkaari kii bhoomika or dayera donon simit he

 Digambar Mishra Diwakar, director of the Sinha Institute of Social Studies, says industries in Bihar are not able to cope with the lack of infrastructure, power shortage is the biggest obstacle
 ve kehete hai, “udyogon ke liye bharose kaa maahaul bhi abhi nahin paidaa ho paa rahaa he
 ”government figures also confirm this
 rajya nivesh protsaahan board ne 1,441 projects ko manjuuri di jinamein sirf 191 hi sthapit ho paae yaa unki koi unit lag pai
 Kanhaiya Singh of NCAER says that increasing excise revenue does not reflect economic progress
 patna vishvavidhyalay kii soshal science faikalti ke dean or professor naval kishor choudhary bhi kehete hai, “yah pragati kaa sakaaratmak pratik nahin he or tikaoo bhi nahin he
 The real progress will come from the production sector, which is not happening in Bihar

 aisa isliye hoga ki telecom regulatory athurity of india (tri) ne sarkaar se sifarish kii he ki vah 2ji sevaaon main istemaal hone vaale spectrum kii rigerv keemat badha de
 This news has been given by an English court

 Read the big ten issues that both of them raised in their articles here
 pita ko putr ke jawaab1
 We are building a new strong economy, which will be beneficial for New India in the long run
 2
 In view of the data of one or two quarters, it should be noted that we are still making structural improvements, which will be beneficial for us in the long run
 3
 The changes that the government is making are the needs of New India
 jo nai iconomi taiyaar ho rahi he vah zyada transperent hogi jisamen lakhon logon ko job milegi
 4
 jiesti, notebandi or digital pement ko badhaava ek gemechenging koshish hai
 The effect of which will be seen in the long run

 yashavanth sinha kaa sarkaar par waar- girti GDP ke bich notebandi aag main tel daalane kii tarahpita yashavanth ne sarkaar par kiye the ye 10 bade waar1
 In one of his articles, Yashwant Sinha had said that the country's economic situation is very bad
 sarkaar aarthik str par kai kshetron main puri tarah naakaam sabit ho rahi he
 2
 yashavanth sinha ne notebandi ke faisle par bhi sarkaar ko aade haathon liya, unhone kaha ki notebandi ne girti jidipi main aag main tel daalane kii tarah kaam kiya
 GST was not implemented properly, due to which there has been a huge difference in job and business
 3
 GDP 5 now
 7 he, sabhi ko yaad rakhana chahie ki sarkaar ne 2015 main jidipi tay karne ke tareeke ko badla tha
 If you look at the old rules, then in today's time 3
 7 jidipi hoti
 4
 arun jetali par tikhaa hamalaa kiya or kaha ki vittamantri naakaam rahe hai
 He had a chance but could not rectify the situation
 unhone kaha ki arun jetali chunaav haar gaye the phir bhi unhen vitt mantri banaaya gaya
 5
 unhone likhaa ki desh kii arthvyavastha ko sudhaarna ab sabase badi chunauti he
 The Prime Minister is concerned about the economic situation of the country, so he will have to reform his Economic Advisor Council once again
 jis tarah mahabharat ko jeetne ke liye pandavon ne kiya tha
 6
 yashavanth sinha ne likhaa ki maine vitt mantralay sambhala he mujhe pataa he ye aasaan kaam nahin he
 This is a 24-hour job that even a superman like Jaitley cannot complete
 7
 In today's time neither job is getting nor development is going fast
 investment ghat rahi he or jidipi bhi ghat rahi he
 8
 yashavanth sinha ne tanj kasate hue kaha ki piem modi kehete hai ki unhone garibi ko kaaphi kareebi se dekha he
 It seems that his finance minister is doing this kind of work to show poverty to all Indians very closely
 9
 He said that it is my national duty that i speak about it now
 bijepi main kai log aise hai jo ki dar kii vajah se kuch nahin bol paa rahe hai
 10
 yashavanth sinha ne likhaa ki arun jetali sabase lucky vitt mantriyon main se ek rahe hai
 But even then, he has not been able to improve the economy of the country
 saal 2012 kii diwali par ajay devgan kii 'san of sardaar' or shahrukh khan kii 'jab tak he jaan' main muqabla hua tha, lekin us jang main ajay devgan baaji maar le gaye the
 Of course both films did good business but 'son of Sardar' managed to get more headlines due to the comedy
 lekin is baar unke saath aisa nahin ho sakaa
 The weak story could not save the film in spite of the superb action and they collapsed at the hands of Karan Johar's 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil'
 haalanki 'i dil he mushkil' ko lekar bhi rivyuu or aalochakon kaa najariya bahut acha nahin tha
 But at the moment, 'shivaay''s lutia is seen sinking and' Ae Dil Hai Mushkil 'is seen crossing its kayak
 'shivaay'ne pichley saat din main 70
 41 crores Rs
 kii kamai kar lee he jabaki ek hafte main 'i dil he mushkil' ne 80
 19 crores Rs
 box offis par ugaah liye hai
 The budget for 'shivaay' is around Rs 100 crore
 se zyada kaa bataaya jaataa he to 'i dil he mushkil' kaa bajet lagbhag 70 karod ru
 Huh
 is tarah ranbir kapur, aishwarya raay bachchan or anoushka sharma ke liye diwali acchhee rahi to vahiin ajay devgan akele apane dam par us tarah kaa jalawaa nahin dikhaa sake jaisi unase ummid thi
 Although there is no major release this week, both films can get a bit more space
 jiskaa sidhaa phayda 'i dil he mushkil' ko miltaa dikh rahaa he
 The funny thing is that Ranbir Kapoor is not getting the benefit of the success of 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil', because this film was not his alone
 ajay devgan ko diarection se zyada focus apni acting kii ore karnaa chahie or usee tarah ranbir kapur ko khud ko dohraane se bachakar kuch fresh or nayaa karne kii bhi jarurat he

 aam aadmi party kii aantarik ladaai thamane kaa naam nahin le rahi he
 This battle is coming to the fore in the meeting of the National Council
 mashhoor kavi or aap netaa kumaar vishwaas is ladaai main thode alag-thalag se najar aa rahe hai
 Since the party has called back AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan, the resentment of such a belief has once again emerged
 vishwaas neemantulla khanke nilamban waapas hone ke baad kaha tha ki vah sirf ek mukhauta he, jad koi or he
 So on Thursday there came the news that when Kumar Vishwas reached the National Council, the supporters of Amanatullah Khan tried to stop his car, the same did the supporters of Vishwas with Amanatullah Khan
 pehle kumaar vishwaas kaa naam vaktaaon kii list main nahin tha, lekin jab vah kaarykram main pahunche to aap kaaryakartaaon ne is par aapatti jataai
 Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia then invited him to address, but Vishwas refused to speak
 kumaar vishwaas manch par to nahin bole lekin, twitor par apni kuch panktiyon se sabakuch jataa diya
 Kumar tweeted, 'unfortunate looters of happiness, what will happen if you speak sorrow
 khaamoshi se darane waalon, 'ham' bole to kya hoga
 
 ?? 🤔
 What will happen if the painless looterogam speaks of happiness, what will we say if we are afraid of silence
 
 ?? 🤔— Dr Kumar Vishvas (@drkumarvishwas) November 2, 2017 This is not the first time such a war is going on in the Aam Aadmi Party
 isse pehle jab amanatulla khan ne hi kumaar vishwaas par aaropon kii jhadi laga di thi, tab bhi vishwaas khaase naaraaz hue the
 However, they were later understood
 kumaar vishwaas in dinon rajasthan aam aadmi party ke prabharee hai
 He is constantly doing many small programs from place to place
 unki aguwai main hi rajasthan main student ellection main aitihaasik jeet darj kii thi
 However, the question now arises that Vishwas has targeted through tweet what will happen if we speak
 to kya kumaar vishwaas ab jab bhi bolenge yaa apana koi sambodhan denge to dekhnaa yah hoga ki unke nishane par koun hoga

 According to a recent study, the problem of procuring stress can also be hereditary
 study main us gunasutreey jode kii pahchaan kar lee gai he, jo mushkil halaat ke baad tanaav kaa khatra badha dete hai
 It is clear from the study that these chromosomes found from generations also bring the problem of increasing mental depression in us from previous generations
 dimag ke kaamon main ahm bhoomika adaa karne vaale in donon gunasutron ko sioimati or tipiech-2 naam se janaa jaataa he
 The head of the study, University of California researcher Armen Goenjian, said that we found a significant relationship between the problem of increasing stress and the comt and TPH-2 chromosomes in research
 ye gunasutra hi is maansik tanaav kii beemaari ko lagaataar badaye rakhane ke liye jimmedaar he
 Goenjian said that the results of our research indicate that people in whom these chromosomes are present may have a higher risk of developing mental depression
 is study se maansik avsaad se samasyagrast logon ke behatar upachaar or nidaan ke liye jaivik aadhaar mil saktaa he
 Most people suffer from this type of mental depression after life-threatening events such as war, rape, or natural disaster, but not necessarily all stressed people have this problem

 Most of his time is spent at his residence in mcleodganj in Himachal Pradesh, where he continues to give informal advice to the exiled government of Tibet
 iske alaava ve duniya bhar main gum-ghumkar vyaakhyaan dete hai or duniya ke sabase taqatvar logon ke saath apane vichaar saajha karte hai, jinamein america raashtrapati baraak obama tak shaamil hai
 The Tibetan community living in the US is celebrating the 80th anniversary of his birth, and while visiting him, the Dalai Lama had a special conversation with senior writer Jyoti Malhotra
 is baatcheet main unhone dashakon se sataha ke neeche khadbadate kuch ahm masalon ke bare main khulkar apane vichaar rakhe&jaise china ke saath unke sambandh, sambhavit nae dalai lamas or bharat main gujarey unke din
 Here are some special excerpts from the interview: Holiness, you have spent 56 years of your 80 years of life in India
 aapke liye iske kya myne hai?meri jindagi kaa ek pahalu yah he ki main ek sharnaarthi hum jo apni mathrubhumi ko kho chukaa he
 i feel sad about this
 haalanki pichley hajaar se bhi zyada varshon se tibet or bharat kaa aapasi rishta bahut kareebi or vishisht rahaa he
 We have always considered India as our Guru
 main khud ko nalanda parampara kaa shishy maanata hum
 That is why India is my spiritual abode
 khaskar isliye bharat main jitani aazaadee praapt he, uski vajah se mujhe kai aadhyatmik guruon, vidwaanon or vaigyanikon se bhi milane kaa avasar hasil he
 Do you still consider yourself a refugee in India? No, i am the oldest guest of the Government of India
 kya aap waapas apane ghar janaa chahenge? tibet lautnaa chahenge?haa, kyonki ek tibeti hone ke naate vahaan ke 90 fisadi se zyada log mere upar bharosa karte hai
 They are anxious to see me and i am confident that i will be able to serve Buddhism in Tibet
 kya aap china kii sarkaar ko is baat ke liye aashwast karnaa chahenge ki tibet usase alag nahin hoga?kya main yah kah saktaa hum ki kai afasar, khaskar kattarpanthi log vaastaviktaa ko nahin dekh paa rahe? jindagi bhar ve log chini itihaaskaaron kii uplabdh karai ekatarfa soochnaaon par bharosa karte rahe hai
 He states that during the seventh-eighth century there used to be three separate kingdoms & Tibetan, Mongolian and Chinese
 lekin yah ateet kii baat ho gai
 i have always appreciated the European Union and India's favor
 bharat kii aazaadee se pehle kai chote-chote rajavaade or raja the, lekin ab samaybadal chukaa he
 If a king today says that i am free and wants a sovereign state, it would be foolish
 isi tarah tibet aitihaasik rup se swatantra raashtra rahaa he, lekin ham ab aage dekhnaa chaahate hai
 It is in our interest to live under the Chinese Republic
 iske saath hi hamaare paas apni samskruti, hamaari sampann buddha parampara or paryaavaran kaa khyaal rakhane kii puri chhot honi chahie
 It is a matter of our mutual benefit
 china main buddha dharm bad rahaa he
 Today there are 400 million Chinese Buddhists
 kya aapaki in chini baudhon main kisi se mulaakaat hui he?haa, china se kai buddha dharmashala aate hai lekin inamen se kai ko yah dar rahata he ki jab unki mulaakaat tibetiyon se hogi to isaki kya pratikriya hogi
 When they listen to my teachings, they even cry
 aapke madhyasthon ne china ke saath kai daur kii vaarta kii he
 Why did not it succeed? China knows that we are not seeking independence, nor is separatism our objective, but many fundamentalists do not want me to come back
 isiilie ve jaan-boojhkar yah dharna failaate hai ki dalai lamas algaavvaadi hai
 Some Chinese officers see me as a devil
 main jab aisi baaten sunata hum to kahata hum, haa, main shaitan hum jiske sir par sing bhi he (hansate hue)
 Overall it is that the fundamentalists there maintain the belief that the Dalai Lama is a problematic man, so he has every right to keep it away
 aap china ke raashtrapati shi jinping ke pita se mil chuke hai
 His mother is a devoted Buddhist
 akele ve hi nahin, balki china ke kai afasar, jinamein sena ke log or communist party ke log bhi shaamil hai or jo khud ko baahar se naastik dikhaate hai, asaliyat main buddha dharm main aasthaa rakhte hai
 When Xi Jinping visited Europe and India last year, he publicly stated that Buddhism is part of Chinese culture
 yah kaaphi chaunkaane vaali baat thi ki china kaa ek communist netaa, jisaki party ne kabhi ghoshnaa kii thi ki har tarah kii aadhyatmikta, khaskar buddha dharm pichhadaapan he, usee party kaa mukhiya aaj buddha dharm ke bare main sakaaratmak baaten kah rahaa he
 Xi Jinping is fighting an almost impossible battle against corruption today
 isse pehle ke do raashtrapati hu jintao or jiyang jhemin bhi bhrashtachar kii samasya se waakif the lekin usase nibatane main unhen dar lagata tha
 Jinping is fighting it with courage and i appreciate it
 matlab ki china main halaat badal rahe hai?haa
 
 
 Jinping is still very young
 main to boodha ho chukaa hum, lekin main itnaa kahana chaahunga ki unka vajan kuch zyada bad gaya he
 They should reduce the weight by doing some exercise
 main unke saahas or unke sochane ke tareeke kii vastav main saraahna karata hum
 Looking at their decisions, it seems that they are quite practical
 yah baat alag he ki vahaan kaa samoochaa tantra hi aisa he ki badlaav laa paanaa mushkil kaam he
 When Jinping came to Delhi last year, there was speculation that the two of you might meet
 mere kuch doston kii yah raay thi, unamem ek chini bijnesaman he
 i also wanted it to happen, but it was not easy
 aap unase milanaa chaahate the?haa, main hameshaa china ke netaaon se milane kaa icchhuk rahaa hum
 Once when i was in Texas, Hu Jintao came to Washington
 us samay bhi maine sandesh bhijwaya tha ki agar sambhav hua to main unase milanaa chaahunga
 That means you and Xi Jinping together can solve the problem of Tibet? Don't know
 tibet sidhe meri jimmedaari nahin he lekin jaisaa maine pehle kaha, sari samasyaayein mil-baithkar baatcheet se hal kii ja sakati hai
 Not from Daman
 ab to kareeb saath saal biit gaye jab maine yah baat kahi thi ki china main bandook kii puja hoti he
 Chairman Mao himself has said that power emanates from the barrel of the gun
 is tarah kii soch sirf jang ke dauraan maujuun ho sakati he
 When i first met Mao and other officials in Peking, i was really impressed and admired him
 ve log sachche taur par samarpit the, janata kii seva karte the, khaskar kaamgaar tabake kii jo sabase zyada shoshit he
 i was so impressed that i had expressed my desire to become a member of the Communist Party of China
 jahaan tak saamaajik-aarthik niti kaa sawaal he, main marxvaadi hum
 This is not a hidden thing
 main leninavaad ke bilkul khilaaf hum jiskaa matlab he bahut kathor niyantran
 i hope that China will become an open minded communist country
 yahaan kii aabaadi ek arab se zyada he isliye china duniya ke maamalon main apana paryaapt yogadan de saktaa he
 To do this it is very important to win the trust and respect of the rest of the world
 ek aisa samaaj jahaan har cheez rajkeey gopneeyata ke daayre main aati ho&vah bharosa kaayam karne ke maamle main bahut nuksandaayak he
 Would you like the Indian government, which has been your host for so many years, to help you in negotiations with China? i think it is the responsibility of not only India but the entire independent world to solve the problems and suffering of any community
 tibet ke saath lagane vaali bharat kii seemaa bahut lambii he, isliye tibet kaa masalaa bharat ke liye ek ahm cheez he
 Our relationship is unique
 kabhi-kabhaar main majaak main hi kahata hum ki tibet, bharat kii pehali raksha pankti he
 It will remain so as long as Tibetan culture and spirituality maintain their place
 bharat hamaara guru he, tibet chela he
 If the disciple has any problem then it becomes the responsibility of the guru to solve it
 jawaharlal nehru ke daur se hi aapkaa bharat ke saare pradhanmantriyon ke saath kareebi rishta rahaa he? narendra modi ke saath kaisaa rishta he? kya unase aapaki mulaakaat hui he?haa, modi jab gujarat ke mukhyamantri the us samay rajya main kuch puraane avshesh mili the
 They were structures like Nalanda where the monks lived
 usee samay main gujarat gaya tha or unase mila tha
 He also came to my room in the hotel
 main kaaphi prabhavit hua tha
 Even after becoming Prime Minister, he is very active
 unke pradhanmantri banane ke baad bhi to aap ek baar mili the?haa, ek choti-si mulaakaat
 Was it really a small meeting? It is confidential, so it is better you ask them (laughs)
 main nahin jaanata, main iske vistaar main nahin janaa chahta
 Do you believe that intolerance is increasing in India? i don't think
 dilli main bhi mujhase aisa hi sawaal poocha gaya tha ki kya musalmaan dare hue hai? maine kaha tha, nahin
 It may be that some people are doing leniency, but largely in India, the religious harmony still prevails
 hamen logon ko lagaataar yaad dilaate rahanaa hoga ki yah kaayam rahanaa chahie
 In the presence of Mohan Bhagwat, leader of the RSS at the World Hindu Congress last year, you said that the RSS should focus more on building schools rather than focusing on temples
 yahi baat main buddha netaaon se bhi kahata hum
 Once he called me to speak while the statue of Padmasambhava was being installed
 maine kaha ki main padmasambhava kaa sammaan karata hum lekin agle hajaar saal tak pratimaa to yahaan khadi rahegi lekin ve bolenge nahin
 That is why we need advice, not a statue
 pratimaa kii puja karnaa puraani reeti he
 Whether they are Chinese, Vietnamese, Burmese or Sri Lankan Buddhists, i always tell everyone that we have to become 21st century Buddhists who are knowledgeable about Buddhism
 haal hi main ham aapke 80wein janmdiwas ke samaaroh ko dekhne ke liye dharmashala gaye the, to hamane dekha ki bhikshu aapaki lambii umr kii prarthana kar rahe the ki aap 113 saal jinda rahe
 Why only 113? i had seen in a dream that i would be alive for 113 years but now i doubt it
 mujhe ab thakaan mahasoos hoti he
 Even in Dharamshala, i had said that i first wished to be 90 and then 100 years old, but after that i have doubts
 taiwan or tibet ke jo chikitsak meri shaareerik sthiti kaa jayja rakhte hai, unke mutabik bahut sambhav he ki main 100 saal tak jinda rahun
 This means that you will decide who will be the next Dalai Lama? i have said before that whether the institution of Dalai Lama will continue or not, the decision will be entirely for the Tibetan people
 aap ise tay nahin karenge?mujhe 15wein dalai lamas kii bahut chintaa nahin he
 Sometimes, it seems that the Chinese government is more concerned about the 15th Dalai Lama than i am concerned about
 kabhi-kabhaar main hasya-vinod main hi kah detaa hum ki chah sau se chali aa rahi is parampara kaa ant 14wein dalai lamas ke saath hi ho janaa chahie, jo paryaapt lokapriy he
 If the 15th Dalai Lama becomes someone and he will tarnish its name, it will be very bad (laughs)
 england ke spinner monti panesar nite club main hue vivaad ke vahaan ke bounsaron par peshaab karne ko lekar khabaron main hai
 Now new information has come to light that after urinating on bouncers, drunk alcoholic Monty Panesar escaped and started trying to hide in a pizza corner

 It is being told that Panesar went to a vodka bar before going to this nightclub
 udhar is prakaran par monti ke pravaktaa ne kaha he ki haa ye sach he ki sharaab pikar huddang karne ke chalate panesar ko fine kiya gaya
 Monty has apologized to everyone on this issue
 jaane kya hua nite club main panesar ke saath US President Donald Trump suddenly reached Afghanistan on the occasion of 'thanksgiving' and once again announced peace talks with the Taliban, but refused to give any deadline to withdraw his troops from there
 ‘bagraam air field' main taliban se dobaaraa baatcheet shuru karne ke sawaal par kaha trump ne kaha, ‘‘haa''
 "the Taliban wants to compromise and we are going to meet them," he said
 jab ham sangharsh viraam chaahate the, ve sangharsh viraam nahin chaahate the or ab ve sangharsh viraam chaahate hai
 i think this will be successful
 ''raashtrapati ne kaha ki america ne pichley chah maheene main kaaphi pragati kii he or uske saath hi apane sainik bhi waapas bula rahaa he
 He told reporters during a hastily held bilateral meeting with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in America's largest airspace in Afghanistan, "we will remain there until an agreement is reached or we are completely won
" Jati and they are eager to compromise
 ''trump ne is baat kii pushti kii ki vah afghanistan main america sainikon kii sankhya ghataakar 8,600 karnaa chaahate hai

 com / gpolxapujb — ANI (@ani_news) February 28, 2015 arpit hotel ke baad karolbaag or uske aasapaas ke hotels par shikanja ksaa to pataa laga ki zyaadaatar hotel ne jo bhi fire fiting equipment laga rakhe hai, unamem se zyaadaatar kaa mentenes hi nahin hota
 At the same time, Fire found that most hotels do not have water storage space and domestic cylinders are in large numbers, but no special arrangements were made to keep them
 arpit hotel kii aag ne na keval 17 kii jaan le lee balki kareeb dedh lakh se zyada logon ko berozegaar kar diya
 Taking lessons from the accident, the Delhi Fire Department has instructed Paharganj Hotel Federation to minimize or remove the use of wood from the reception and stairs
 dilli fire chif jisi mishra ne hotel bijnesaman ko aashwaasan diya ki 15 kamaron vaale hotel par jo norms lagate hai or 20 par jo norms lagate hai usee hisaab se hi checking kii jaaegi
 Hotel Federation's Joint Secretary Arun Gupta has assured that since the incident, he will now undergo a technical AMC Annual Maintenance check of Fire Fighting Equipments, so that the maintenance of fire items is confirmed every month
 pahadganj ilaake main fire kii 6 team inspection kar rahi hai
 After Paharganj, there will be an inspection in the whole of Delhi, the hotels whose noc has been suspended have been given around 15 days to fix all the norms
 norms ye kahata he ki chote hotalon main har floor par aag bujhane ke do silendar hone chahie, usase bade hotalon main hojri or pump ke saath hi agsit sin board, fire alarm, sprincolor, hydrant hone chahie
 In 2010, according to the Delhi Fire Service Act in the new policy, hotels, guest houses, residential buildings come in, to which the rules of fire apply according to the number of rooms, the particular points of the new policy that are being discussed are the most special
 This is to have adequate living and ventilation arrangements to get out, so that people can use it in any fire emergency
 kuch aise arrangement bhi kiye ja rahe hai, jisase kii turant soochna mili jaise arpit main dedh ghante baad soochna mili thi
 The Delhi Fire Chief claimed that within a month the government could bring a new policy for the fire
 is par bhi par kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 It is difficult to apply the law of fire and their rules law on buildings built at different times
 aise main agar fire fiting lagane ke liye puraa strecchar badalanaa pade to kaaphi mushkilen aati hai, aise main dekha ja rahaa he ki strectural change karke kaise sefti ko badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 In the absence of Arun Jaitley, Piyush Goyal will present the interim budget of Modi government on 1 February
 kaha ja rahaa he ki is bajet main har varg ke liye kuch khaas hoga
 Because there is 2019 Lok Sabha election in front
 darasal modi sarkaar ne apane kaarykaal main tamaam yojanaon kii shuruyaat kii, jisamen kai to safal raheen lekin kuch yojanaon main ummid ke mutabik rigelt nahin mil paaya he
 Now the opposition is attacking the government regarding these schemes and the government is cutting the thread to talk
 ham aapke liye aisi hi 5 yojanaon kii list lekar aae hai, jis par sarkaar kamyaabi kii dhol peetane se batch rahi he
 1
 skill indiyakaushal bharat yojana kii shuruyaat NDA sarkaar ne 15 july 2015 ko kii thi
 It was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself on the occasion of International Youth Day
 is muhim ke tahat 2022 tak bharat ke kareeb 40 karod logon ko alag-alag kaushal main prashikshit karne kaa lakshya he, jo prashikshan ke baad aatmanirbhar ho saken
 Skill India is also a dream project of PM Modi
 lekin sarkaar ko is muhim se jo ummid thi, wo hasil nahin hui he
 The government has also got the meaning of this, so last year itself, the government made a big change in it and took charge of this ministry from Rajiv Pratap Rudy
 vipaksh ab skill india ko flop bataa rahaa he
 At the same time, the government also seems to be avoiding this open discussion, because the current figures are far from the target set by the government
 2
 The government is also on backfoot regarding banning of demonetisation
 sarkaar ko ummid thi ki isse bade paimaane par kaledhan kaa khulaasa hoga
 But 99
 3 fisadi puraane note bank main waapas aa gaye
 Due to which the opposition further intensified the attack on the government
 ab to bijepi netaa notebandi par jansabhaon main zikr karne se bachate hai
 At the same time, the opposition alleges that PM Modi implemented demonetisation without thinking
 jisase logon ke saamne nakadi sankat aa gaya or note badalane ke kram main kareeb 100 logon maut ho gai
 Demonetisation was announced on 8 November 2016 from Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 jisase tahat 1000 or 500 rupee ke note ko avaidh qaraar de diya gaya tha
 3
 kaledhan2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle khud narendra modi ne kalaadhan vaapasi ko lekar upie sarkaar par sawaalon kii bauchhaar kar dete hai
 He promised the people that soon after the formation of the NDA government at the Center, there will be a big result on the issue of black money
 lekin chaar saal se zyada kaa vakt biit gaya he or is mudde par sarkaar ko koi badi kamyaabi nahin mili he
 The black money deposited abroad has not been returned yet
 ab sarkaar kaledhan jaise masalon par charchaa karne se batch rahi he
 At the same time, the opposition says that the Modi government has not yet taken any meaningful step on the return of black money
 4
 Smart City In 2014, this scheme was launched in the name of 'smart City' to make 100 cities smart across the country
 iske liye nagarikon ke anukool shahari kshetra viksit karne ke liye 6,85,758 karod rupee se zyada ke nivesh sahit kai anya pahal kii gai
 This mission covers 100 cities and has a duration of five years (from fiscal year 2015-16 to financial year 2019-20)
 lekin ab lagata he ki sarkaar kaa yah project thande baste main chalaa gaya he
 Because four years have passed and the work has not yet been done at the speed that the roadmap was prepared
 kab tak ye project puraa hoga is bare main bhi ab koi dedline tay nahin he
 That is, this was a scheme of the Modi government, from which people had high hopes
 lekin chaar saal main apeksha ke anuroop rigelt nahin mila he
 5
 namaami gange yojanamodi sarkaar ne ganga kii safai ko lekar 2014 main hunkaar bhari thi, satta main aate hi ganga ko nirmal banane ke liye alag se mantralay tak bana diya gaya or jimmaa uma bharti ko saunpa gaya
 The government has earmarked Rs 20 thousand crore on this plan in 5 years
 isamen se badi rakam kharch bhi ho gai, lekin ganga maili kii maili rah gai
 Then the immediate Ganga ministry was handed over to Nitin Gadkari
 sarkaar ko bhi lagata he ki jis teji se ganga safai kaa kaam hona tha, nahin ho paaya
 Still the government is avoiding speaking on this openly
 ab nitin gadakari kaa kahana he ki 2020 tak ganga kaa pani pine ke laayak ho jayega
 But in the name of cleaning the Ganges, the Opposition continues to surround the government
 vipaksh kaa kahana he ki namaami gange yojana vittiya prabandhan kii aniyamitata or ganga safai ke liye yojanaon ke banane main kii gai letlatifi ke kaaran lakshya se peeche chal rahi he
 Neither of these two comment on the future of the relationship between Katrina Kaif and Ranbir Kapoor
 inke bich badhati nazdikiyon kii jhalak spain ke ibisa island par lee gai photose main saaf dikh rahi he
 Ranbir has already known that Katrina is a special person in his life
 ab cat ne bhi apane relationships ke bare main khulkar baat kii he
 Talking to a newspaper, Kat said, 'I take care of Ranbir a lot and i am very serious about him
 'unhone yah bhi kaha ki ranbir or unke relationships jaisi boding ke liye soul kaa conection jaruri he
 Recently, Katrina gave a statement that Ranbir is a very big part of her life
 lekin haal philhal main unka shaadi kaa koi plan nahin hai

 Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who has been the victim of criticism from all around for the rising crime against women in West Bengal, has asked, "are all women in the state being raped?" North 24 Parganas district Mamta Banerjee became quite angry at a section of the media during a Trinamool Congress rally in k Meenakhan on Sunday
 baukhalaai mamata ne kaha, 'vipaksh ke saath in channelon kii santh-ganth he or ye sarkaar ke upar keechad oochhaalane ke liye abhiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 By doing this, they are insulting the soil of Bengal
 'isse pehle mukhyamantri ne daawa kiya tha, 'ek media house vipaksh ke saath milakar unki hatya kii sajeesh rach rahaa he
 In fact, the Chief Minister had recently been raging against the villagers who were protesting after the rape of a college student in Kamudni village of the district, since then they have been protesting a lot
 apane aalochakon kaa majaak udaate hue mamata banerjee ne kaha tha, 've har baat ke liye mujhe jimmedaar tehraate hai
 Now they are also blaming me for the incidents of rape
 jaise ki vah main hi hum jo ki rape karne ke liye jaati hum
 'significantly, many cases of recent rape and murder have occurred in the state

 The SC-ST Act, which the BSP and all the Dalit parties have created a city-to-city battle, was not only amended during Mayawati's rule in Uttar Pradesh, but this law was also relaxed
 
 mjedaar baat yah he ki yahi sanshodhit kanoon uttar pradesh main aaj bhi lagu he
 Even today, the SC-ST Act is implemented in a different way, under which there is no direct arrest
 do april ko uttar pradesh samet kai rajyon main is kanoon ko lekar sadakon par utre dalit sanghathanon ne jo hinsa failaai thi, use puure desh ne dekha, lekin is hinsa ke do din baad hi 2007 main mayawati sarkaar kaa vah sarkari aadesh ek baar phir saamne aa gaya, jisamen essi-asti act ko na sirf sanshodhit kiya gaya, balki usamen ek dhara 182 lagaakar yah aadesh paarit kiya gaya ki agar koi iskaa durupyog karegaa, to uske khilaaf bhi karrwai hogi
 Not only this, arrest under SC-ST Act will be done only when an officer of CO level gets the case right in his deliberations 
 bispi supremeo mayawati ke shashan main 20 may 2007 ko tatkaaleen mukhya sachiv prashanth kumaar ne ek sarkari aadesh nikaalkalanusuchit jati-janajati adhiniumme kuch bade badlaav kiye the, jiske tahat hatya or balaatkaar jaise maamalon main is act ko lagane se pehle espi yaa esaspi ko apni vivechna kerani hoti he
 The government order clearly stated that no innocent should be harassed or framed under this act and if anyone does so, action will be taken against him under section 182
 maaloom ho ki mayawati ke shashan main nikaala gaya yah sarkari aadesh aaj bhi uttar pradesh main amal main he
 This order of Mayawati is considered as an amendment to the Scheduled Castes and Tribes Act, which reduces the scope of trapping innocent people
 haalanki supreme court ke faisle ke khilaaf uttar pradesh main sadakon par huihinsaamein giraftaar logon main kai netaa bahujan samaaj party ke hai
 Mayawati herself is now openly opposed to the Supreme Court's decision, but her own order during her rule tells a different story
 mayawati ke is aadesh kii copy ke saamne aane ke baad se bijepi bispi supremeo mayawati par hamalavar ho gai he or khulkar mayawati par yah aarope laga rahi he ki daliton or adivaasiyon ke liye banaae gaye is act ko sabase pehle or sabase zyada kamjor khud mayawati ne kiya he
 Now it will be interesting to see what logic Mayawati, who gives a point-wise answer to everything, comes out after this government order of her own? america raashtrapati baraak obama ke saath matbhedon kii khabaron ke bich aaj raksha mantri chak hegal ne apane pad se istipha de diya

 ' isse pehle obama prashasan main robert gates evam leone peneta raksha mantri rah chuke hai

 He said, 'as stated by the President, today i submitted my resignation as Defense Minister
 raksha vibhaag ke purushon or mahilaon ke saath seva karne or unke pariwaron kaa sahyog karne tathaa unka netritv karnaa mere jivan kaa sabase bada saubhaahgya rahaa he
 During this time, i am very proud of the achievements we have made
 ' The news of Hegel's readiness to resign was first reported by The New York Times

 jaahir-si baat he ki rail bajet kii purv sandhya par rail mantri dinesh trivedi aise shaks ban gaye hai, jo nishtha, antaratma or anischitata ke dukhadaayi trikon main fanse hue najar aa rahe hai
 She owes her loyalty to Mamata Banerjee, the Trinamool Congress leader, who wants her to continue the politics of bravado by not increasing passenger fares and thus pushing the Railways towards bankruptcy
 lekin unki antaratma is tathy se pareshaani main he ki 16,000 karod ru
 The loss of the railway is facing the railway
 saare sanket yahi mil rahe hai ki trivedi apni antaratma kii aawaaj sunne ke liye taiyaar hai or yatri bhaade main badhotaree kii ghoshnaa karne kaa man bana chuke hai, jisamen har tarah ke maal bhaade main 10 fisadi kii vruddhi hogi or mukhyatah asi main safar karne vaale yatriyon ko nishaanaa bana kar yatri bhaade main santulan bithaaya jayega
 February 8, 2012: India Today in Pictures 1 February 2012: Pictures Today India Today is stuck in the possibility that the political situation may be reversed after the Uttar Pradesh elections
 agar paristhitiyaan achaanak kaabo se baahar ho gayi to yah bhi ho saktaa he ki unhen vah bajet pesh karne kaa mauka hi na mili, haalanki unhone rail bajet taiyaar karne ke liye kadi mehnat kii he
 In one of his many meetings with railway officials across the country, Trivedi has expressed his religious crisis well
 baar-baar yah sandesh milane par ki yatri bhaade main badhotaree karne kii jarurat hogi, unhone adhikariyon se kaha ki unki nishtha railway ke prati he or unhen apana kartavya nibhaana he
 They said, ''
 
 
 agar yatri bhaade ko badhaane kii jarurat hui, to main use badhaaungaa
 "however, after a few seconds of silence, these words of bravery were followed by a few languid words," if i were allowed to present the budget
 
 
 ''north east frontier railway jone ke ek adhikari ne kaha ki 20 minute kii avadhi ke dauraan mantri mahoday aashaa or niraashaa ke bich jhulate rahe
 Their motives were very clear as well as the fact that they were helpless
 haalanki mantri ne india today se baatcheet main is baat se saaf inkaar kiya ki ve shaktiheen hai balki unhone is baat par jor diya ki bajet taiyaar karne ke liye unhen har kism kii aazaadee mili hui he
 He admitted that increasing passenger fares is an 'ideological issue', but as a minister, he will do what needs to be done
 unke kareebi sutara daawa karte hai ki trivedi swayan ko duty karne nikle sainik kii tarah maanate hai, or javaabi golibari main apni jaan ganvaane se ve katai darate nahin hai
 "he has accepted a government ambassador in lieu of his Bentley (luxury car)," said a source
 ve waapas apni bendle par savaar honge or ek vyavsaayee ban jaaenge
 "there are many stories that people close to him narrate and that shows how Mamta wants to control him
" janvari ke ant main congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi se milane unke ghar jane par unki khinchaai ho chuki he
 On 3 February, Mamta sought Trivedi's clarification in her Kolkata office and alleged that they were doing their work at the behest of Congress
 mana jaataa he ki trivedi ne mamata ko jawaab diya ki ve uttar pradesh ke liye railway kii pariyojnaon par charchaa karne gaye the or yah bhi kaha ki chunki ve purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ko unke payalat rahane ke dinon se jaanate hai, isliye us parivaar ke saath unke athmiya sambandh hai
 Trivedi himself is a certified pilot
 1991 main rajeev gandhi kii antyeshti ke samay ve rahul ke saath hi the
 It is not known whether she was satisfied with this explanation or not, but Trivedi herself is feeling bonded
 ve vibhinn saarvajanik manchon se un bandhanon kii ore ishaara kar chuke hai, jinke tahat unhen kaam karnaa pad rahaa he
 At the India PPP Summit-2012 organized by FICCI on 31 January, Trivedi stressed the need to 'take the Railways beyond politics' as a precondition for development
 unhone railway ke liye aisi rashtriya niti kaa aahvaan kiya tha, jo sarkaar yaa rail mantri badalane ke baavjood barkaraar rahe
 Trivedi had said that this policy should establish a revenue model, whose main focus is on safety and passenger amenities
 unhone ek swatantra nikaay-railway kiraaya praadhikaran-kaa bhi sujhav diya, jo rajnatik baadhyataaon se prabhavit hue bina railway kiraayon par faisla le sake
 The bottom line is very clear
 trivedi se pehle ke kai rail mantriyon ne apni rajnatik rotiyaan senkane ke liye railway kaa jamkar dohan kiya he
 They also include Mamta, who used the railway ministry as a halt to reach Kolkata's Writers Building
 unase pehle, lalu prasad yadav kii kismat acchhee thi ki ve vikaas kii lahar par tairte rahe or ve itane chatur bhi the ki unhone railway ke prashasan ko ek chatur afasarshah, officer on special duty sudhir kumaar ke hawaale kar diya tha
 The last minister to increase rail fares was Nitish Koora in 2002-03
 uske baad se rail haada jas-kaa-tas chalaa aa rahaa he
 16,000 crore to the Railways
 kaa ghaataa 2011-12 main 20,000 karod ru
 Budgetary support of Rs
 3,000 crore and Rs
 3,000 crore from Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee on 6 February
 ke ek or rin kii manjuuri ke baavjood ho rahaa he
 Considering the amount of money needed to get the railway back on track, this amount is like cumin in the camel's mouth
 trivedi kah chuke hai ki railway ko kshamta main ijapha karne or aadhunikeekaran ke liye 2020 tak 14 lakh karod ru
 Will be needed
 ve khud sweekaar karte hai ki railway ab bhi 'pashaan yug' main fansi hui he
 Railway Minister Trivedi says that what he has seen as a minister is a matter of grave concern
 unka kahana he, ''agar ham railway kaa aadhunikeekaran nahin karte, to main nahin samajhta ki ham 100 fisadi suraksha kii guarantee de sakate hai

 Arshad Warsi, who made a mark in Bollywood with his acting, is not happy with the introduction today
 arshad varsi kaa naam aate hi logon ko 'sahar', 'golmaal', 'jolly elelbi' or munnabhai siries main unke nibhaae kirdaar kii yaad aa jaati he
 Now his film 'guddu Rangeela' is ready for release soon, when we talked to Arshad Warsi, he told many special things about the film
 aaiye jaanate hai kya kuch khaas bataaya arshad ne hamaari team ko
 Have you heard that your 'rangeela' character is quite serious? Yes, but i told director Subhash Kapoor to change my name, because my name is Rangeela, but Rangila is doing all the good work
 jo guddu he wo rangila he or rangila bilkul bhi rangila nahin he
 However, my character who used to be very happy at first, but as life changes, it becomes a bit serious
 lekin jis tarah se subhash ne likhaa he uske hisaab se syrius hote hue bhi 'rangila' manoranjan karata hi rahata he
 Does your character resemble the character of Manoj who died during honor killing? See the incident has been used partially but the entire film is not based on it
 yah film guddu or rangila kii kahani he
 My character's past is inspired by Manoj's story
 aap ek majhe hue dancer bhi hai, kya is film main nrity kaa mauka mila he?nahin yaar, meraa bed lack he, 'mata kaa i-mail' main maine kirdaar ke hisaab se dance kiya he
 You do not miss to dance? i do man, what to do, the film is becoming like this, but i think i will get a chance to dance well in the upcoming film 'fraud Saiyan'
 shaayad tital sang par thirakta hua najar aauungaa
 Do you think Subhash Kapoor's films have more impact after some time? i think Subhash's style is 'realistic commercial', and i like these types of films
 mujhe kismat se subhash mil gaya he jo is kism kii filmein likhata he
 So the connection between the two of us has sat down
 'jolly elelbi' ke baad log ek pal main subhash kii filmein dekhne jaaenge
 Do you miss typical comedy films? i like doing all kinds of movies
 ek taraf 'sahar' to duusari taraf 'guddu rangila' bhi kar letaa hum, to kamedi or syrius donon tarah kii filmein kar letaa hum
 Recently i have heard a script by Pankaj Parashar, and my interest towards it is also increasing
 unhone mujhe kamedi script sunai he
 It will have a madcap comedy with two boys and it will go into my 'dhamaal' and 'golmaal' space
 aapako lagata he 'byopic' bananaa sabase aasaan kaam he?nahin, bilkul nahin yaar, khaas taur se actor ke liye bahut mushkil kaam he
 Ever wanted to do a biopic? i was told by Colonel Kapoor, the director of the serial 'fauji', a biopic on 'veer Shivaji' and he wanted me to play that character
 unhone kaha tha ki main us role ke saath puri tarah se nyaay kar paaunga
 i hope if someone makes that film in the coming days then i would definitely like to do it
 khabar thi ki agar aamir khan 'circuit' kaa kirdaar nibhaayenge to aap dhooma 3 karenge?aamir ne kaha kii use circuit kaa role karnaa he, ye uskaa badppan he, wo aise hi kah rahaa he
 So i said it will never happen but i just said 'do one thing, tell Aamir to do that circuit and i do' Dhoom '(laughing): Is Golmaal or Munnabhai's next series being made? i do not know, no one has told me, i will do it, but Munnabhai will definitely be made
 usko thodaa vakt lagegaa
 Sanju (sanjay Dutt) comes out a little, relax and then the dates will be adjusted
 lekin banegi jarur
 You feel insecure in the industry? No, if you know about your job then you will not feel insecure
 jaise aaj amit ji (amitabh bachchan),nasiruddin shah, rishi kapur jindagi bhar kaam kar sakate hai
 So i am playing such a character today, first of father, then of grandfather
 aise chalata rahoonga
 If you know about work then there is no insecurity
 aapke donon bacchon kaa kya rujhaan he?bahut maje main hai, bade ho rahe hai

 He should save the game and not the countries on the DRS issue
 ’ rantunga ne kaha ki bhartiya board yadi isisi ko haashiye par rakhata he to bhi isisi main kade faisle lene kaa dam hona chaiye
 It should make DRS mandatory for all countries
 unhone kaha, ‘pichley 20 saal main cricket main hui yah sabase acchhee baat he or mujhe lagata he ki diares kaa istemaal sabhi deshon ko karnaa chaiye
 If DRS were in our time, we would have been a better batsman, bowler and fielder

 Karthiki got back to life as a basketball child
 kartiki ne phir peeche mud kar nahin dekha or ab wo is khel main bharat kii captain hai

 lekin ek mode tak pahunchane ke baad maine kuch karne kii thaanee
 Started swimming
 main pehle bhi khilaadi thi isliye antar jaanati thi
 In normal sports you are able to think where you want to go and where your legs can take you
 game bahut tej hota he
 But when you are in a wheelchair, you also have to move the wheelchair forward
 bal ko bhi pakadana hota he
 It is not easy
 wheelchair handlling tecnic hi ahm hoti he
 You do not get any support from legs

 During the search operation by security forces in the area at that time, Ishrat was in such a panic that she jumped from the roof of the house

 i tell them that sports is part of education and not luxury
 ye unamem aatmavishvaas jagaata he
 The more support we get, the more talent we will be able to identify
 ”team kii ek or sadsy indu ne kaha, ‘jab mujhase pehali baar wheelchair basket bal ke liye sampark kiya gaya to main isse judane ke paksh main nahin thi
 i am a disabled person but i did not need a wheelchair
 ’ janm ke vakt se hi indu ke donon pairon main asamanta thi
 Indu liked her when she came for TRAIL
 indu ke mutabik wo pehali koshish main hi basket karne main kaamyaab rahi thim
 With its debut in 2014, the Wheelchair Basketball Federation of India (WBFI) is campaigning to empower disabled players through the sport
 head coach captain louis jorge kaa kahana he, ‘buniyadi mushkil ye he ki in khilaadiyon ke ek maheene lambey koching camp main shirkat ke baad jab ghar lautnaa hota he to vahaan practice ke liye unhen achche court nahin milte
 Some have to travel up to 30 kilometers
 ’team kii doctor kya bolintim kii doctor ramya kahati hai, ‘khilaadiyon par bahut zyada dhyaan or dekharekh kii jarurat hoti he

 vaise to piem modi purvanchal express-ve kaa shilanyas karne ke liye pahunche the, lekin unke nishane par yahaan mahagathbandhan hi rahaa
 Taking a dig at the SP-BSP alliance, PM Modi said that these two never used to give each other a happy eye, but today they have been forced to walk together to save their existence
 piem modi ne apane bhaashan main kaha, 'baba sahab ambedkar or ram manohar ke naam par upi kii in donon partiyon ne keval ab tak raajnneeti kii he
 They have nothing to do with the well being of the poor
 garib, dalit, pichhadon se vot maange or inke naam par apni raajnneeti kii, lekin kabhi unke bare main gambhirtha se sochaa nahin
 Taking a dig at the SP and BSP alliance, PM Modi said that people who never liked to see each other, have now got together
 jitne bhi log jamaanat par hai, jitne bhi parivaar vaale log hai wo janata ke vikaas ko rokna chaahate hai
 If PM Modi believes, if the poor, farmers and backward become empowered, then their shops will be closed forever
 sabhi parivaravaadi partiyaan milakar aapke vikaas ko rokane par tuli hui hai
 PM Modi also attacked the Congress, SP and BSP for the triple talaq issue
 unhone kaha, 'lakhon-karodon muslim bahanon kii maang thi ki teen talaak ko band kiya jaae, lekin in saare dalon kii pole to teen talaak par inke ravaiye ne bhi khol di he
 The whole country saw his attitude in Parliament regarding triple talaq
 jab bijepi sarkaar ne teen talaak kaa kanoon laane kii koshish kii to congress ne usamen bhi baadha paidaa karne kii koshish kii
 Praising Yogi Sarkar, the PM said that there should be intention for development
 aazaadee ke baad 70 varshon main jitna kaam hua utana sirf 4 saal main bijepi sarkaar ne karke dikhaaya he
 The UPA government has only done good for his family
 congress jaise dal aaj 21veen sadi main bhi 18veen sadi main ji rahe hai
 The government is sensitive to every need of the public
 modi ko hataane vaale kaa naaraa dene vaale desh ko vikaas nahin de sakate
 Significantly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on a two-day visit to Purvanchal
 piem banan ke baad pehali baar azamgarh kii jameen par kadam rakhaa

 Yes, this is happening due to the infighting that emerged in Rajasthan BJP
 aapako bataa den ki party ke senior emeleghanashyam tiwaribaghi ho chuke hai
 He has started this Deendayal Vahini
 ab bhartiya janata party kii rajasthan ikai ke adhyaksh ashok paranami kaa kahana he ki dinadayal vahini main kaam karne vaala vyakti bhaajapa kaa sadsy nahin rahegaa
 After this statement of Parnami, there is a possibility of controversy rising again

 While answering questions during the press conference in Manrauli Karauli, there is a difference, Parnami said that the BJP has a large family of 80 lakh members in the state
 kuch sadasyon main matbhed ho sakate hai lekin manabhed nahin hai
 He said that the party's national organization General Secretary Ram Lal has given detailed instructions on the organizational issues of the party in consultation with officials and workers, including working towards strengthening the party up to the booth level
 paranami ne kaha, maujuuda samay main karauli jile main chaar vidhansabha siton main se sirf ek par bhaajapa vidhayak he, lekin agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main chaaron site bhaajapa ke paas hongi
 Parnami was in Karauli today with National Organization General Secretary Ram Lal
 tiwari ne lagaaya tha aaropavarisht vidhayak ghanashyam tiwadi ne sarkaar banane ke baad vichaardhaara kii andekhi or bhrashtachar kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 After this, he was sent a notice of indiscipline
 bijepi ke varisht netaa vidhansabha chunaav main jaipur ke sanganer vidhansabha se sarvaadhik voton se jeeten lekin kai baar mantri rahe tiwari ko vasundhara raaje ne is baar mantrimandal main jagah nahin di thi
 There are 36 figures of Ghanshyam Tiwari from Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje
 lekin mantri nahin banaae jane se khafa tiwari ne vasundhara raaje ke khilaaf kabhi paroksh to kabhi aparoksh rup se hamalaa bolnaa jari rakhaa tha
 But BJP state president Ashok Parnami, close to Vasundhara Raje, had complained to Tiwari about central discipline

 Prasoon Joshi told me that the song Babylon i wrote on the agony of a girl's mind, what a girl must have thought when she had to leave her father's house
 isliye maine ye gaanaa likhaa
 When Prasoon was asked if the girls had anything to do with their minds and their dreams, then they had written a lot, Prasoon responded by saying these words
 'suraj ko to dhoop khilaanaa tha or beti ko to savera laana tha or subah hokar rahi
 
 
 'prasoon Joshi told the importance of poetry and songs in life and said that the work of the poet is to give expression to the thoughts of the mind and bring it to the fore
 ab ise samajhnaa aapkaa kaam he
 Prasoon has written something on this
 usee kii kuch panktiyaan
 
 
 Goals seek those who do not love the present

 Look at the roundness of the moment, see the orange pungency, disintegrating on the far horizon
 paksh dhundte hai wo jinako ye jivan swakir nahin he
 When asked about the monsoon, do you always find something that will harmonize your thoughts with you? In response to this, he said that the same thing happens when i write and i see it in my films as well
 kavita bhi vahi he
 Everything has been composed and the work of the poet is to put that composition from his writing into words
 kya soch kar aapane taare jameen par film kaa maa song likhaa? iske jawaab main prasoon ne kaha bachapan main jab main ek baar apni maa se juda hua to mujhe kai tarah se apni maa kii yaad ai or usee ko sochakar maine ye gaanaa likhaa
 How will a child miss his mother away from the mother and this song just made a place in the heart of every parent and child
 
 After writing on the mother, i also wrote for the father because after writing this song i received letters from many fathers that we are not so bad
 bas isliye maine pita ke liye bhi kuch likhaa he
 Prasoon Joshi narrated his work on bringing girls' medals to the Olympics

 And getting up in the morning
 centre main 2014 main satta sanbhaalane ke baad or jammu kashmir main 2016 main pidipi ke saath sarkaar banane vaali bhaajapa sarkaar ne kashmir main nai ranneeti apanaate hue ekbar phir baatcheet shuru karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Former IB Chief Dineshwar Sharma has been appointed on behalf of the Central Government to take forward the dialogue process in Kashmir
 lekin sawaal yah he ki kya is baatcheet kii prakriya se kuch hasil hoga yaa maatr samay lene kii ek or koshish he
 The situation in the valley has worsened since the encounter of Hizbul commander Burhan Wani in Jammu and Kashmir on 8 June last year
 kai maheenon tak kashmir main ashaanti par kaabo paane ke liye sarkaar ne har tarah kii ranneeti apanaai, lekin kashmir main aman shanti nahin laut pai
 Now the government is going to implement the speech of Prime Minister Narendra Modi which he told the Red Fort on August 15 this year that not abusing Nagoli and embracing the Kashmiris will solve the problem
 vaajapeyi ke formule par lauti centre sarkarlekin sawaal yahi khadaa ho rahaa he ki kya bhaajapa kashmir par apni policy badal rahi he or purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kii raah hi pakad rahi he
 Vajpayee started the process of dialogue with the Hurriyat leaders along with Pakistan, despite the Kargil war
 lekin hakeekat yahi he ki kashmir main abhi baatcheet kaa maahaul nahin ban paaya he
 The NIA is investigating against most Hurriyat leaders, many of whom are lodged in jails in Delhi
 aatankwaad ke khilaaf sena or suraksha balon kaa opershan aal out bhi jari he or pakistan ke saath seemaa par tanaav bana hua he
 To create an atmosphere of dialogue, the government will first have to clear how it will create an atmosphere of dialogue and with whom the talks will take place
 kyonki pichley teen saal main kai baar grih mantri rajnath singh kashmir main kai pratinidhiyon or raajnneetik dalon se mil chuke hai
 Senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinhais visited Kashmir several times and every time he recommended to start talks with all parties including separatists
 to kya phir sarkaar ab hurriyat se baatcheet kaa man bana chuki he
 The leadership of the conversation has been given to Dineshwar Sharma only because the recent decision of the Center has given a clear indication that the government can also talk to the Hurriyat leaders on the Kashmir issue
 lekin sawaal yah bhi he ki baatcheet kii kaman purv IB chif dineshwar sharma ko kyon saunpi gai
 In fact, Dineshwar Sharma has a lot of experience in solving the Kashmir problem
 dineshwar sharma ne kashmir maamalon ko us daur main sambhala, jab aatankwaad charam par tha
 The most difficult situation in Kashmir was faced by Dineshwar Sharma when 30 foreign terrorists led by Mast Gul held the famous Dargah of charare-sharif in May 1995 for a month
 aatankwaadiyon ko charaare-sharif se nikalne ke liye tab sena kaa ek bada abhiyaan chalaaya gaya tha
 There were also reports that the then government had given safe passage to many foreign terrorists, including Mast Gul, to get out of the dargah and rescued the dargah from the clutches of the terrorists
 lekin dekhnaa ab yah he ki dineshwar sharma ghati kab pahunchate hai or kab tak apni report sarkaar ko dete hai

 ‘en appal e de, keeps doctor awe’ yani pratidin ek seb kaa seven karne se sehat durust rahati he
 You must have heard this saying, but apart from this saying, apple is very useful
 ek taaja survey main saamne aayaa he ki seb ke seven se mahilaon main kaamuktha badhati he
 Studies have shown that eating apples daily enhances sexual function in healthy women
 seb main polifeynolls or antioxident hote hai jo jananaangon main rakt pravaah ko badhaane main madad karte hai
 This results in better sexual arousal in women
 is nirnay tak pahunchane ke liye shodhakartaaon ne italy main 18 se 43 saal tak kii umr kii 731 swasth mahilaon ko adhyayan main shaamil kiya
 Women in the study filled out the 'female Sexual Function Index' (FSFI), which had questions about sexual function, sex frequency, sexual intercourse, lubrication, and overall sexual satisfaction
 shodhakartaaon ko adhyayan main pataa chalaa ki jo mahilaayein roj ek yaa do seb khaati hai unka lubrication or over ol sexul function zyada behatar he
 Apples also contain fluorazine which is a common phytestrogen
 yah sanrachanaatmak rup se estrodeol kii hi tarah he

 dilli main aae din katl kii koi na koi vaardaat hoti hi rahati he
 People take the lives of their friends on small matters
 katl kii aise hi ek ghatana palam ilaake main hui, jab 20 saal ke yuvak animesh kii goli markar hatya kar di gai
 Animesh's old experts were accused of killing him
 buudhvaar kii raat palam thane police ko jaankaree mili ki ek 20 saal ke ladke ko kisi ne goli maar di he
 The police team rushed to the spot and rushed to the hospital with a blood-soaked boy, but the doctors declared him dead
 police ne jab jaanch shuru kii to pataa laga ki animesh ke ghar ke paas main hi rahane waalon se unki kuch din pehle kisi maamuli baat par kahasuni ho gai thi, jiske kuch dinon baad animesh ke saath unheen logon ne hathapayee bhi kii thi
 The police team immediately started searching for those people, due to which one accused was caught in the night
 aarope he ki animesh kii hatya main kareeb chaar log shaamil the
 Police say that further investigation is being conducted on the basis of questioning of one of the arrested accused and a team has been formed to nab the absconding accused
 animesh kii maut ke baad uskaa puri parivaar sadame main he
 People do not believe that Animesh was killed because of a minor argument
 animesh ke padosiyon kaa kahana he ki animesh behad shant swabhaav kaa tha or logon se zyada baat nahin karata tha
 On Wednesday night, he was walking in the street when four boys came and shot him and escaped
 chaaku kii nok par train ke andar luutarajadhani dilli main samaypur badali railway stesan ke outer par lutpaat hui he
 It was half past three in the morning on Thursday, 12266 Duronto Express train was coming towards Delhi, when it reached Samaypur Badli station, due to not getting the signal, it had to stop at the first outbound from Badli station, but that train was there
 Some crooks were waiting, as soon as the rogue train stopped, they entered into the B-3 and B7 coaches with knives in hand and robbed the passengers who were seen in front
 peedit yatriyon ne police ko bataaya ki vaardaat ke baad jab wo surakshakarmi or atendand ko talashne lage to unhen koi nahin mila
 When the train reached the New Delhi station, the victim was called to the police on number 100, after which a case was registered in this regard at the Sabzi Mandi railway police station
 maukey par maujuud logon kaa kahana he ki is jagah par pehle bhi is tarah kii vaardaat ho chuki he
 Seeing the seriousness of the matter, the top police officers arrived on the spot and investigated, the officials associated with rail security said that along with the attempt to apprehend the accused, it was also being investigated how the rogue entered the train Taxes were successful in looting and the RPF did not even get a clue
 vaardaat ke baad do yatriyon ashoka or basant bhandari ne police main likhit shikaayat di, jiske baad police ne lutpaat kaa cese darj kiya he
 Police say that so far only two passengers have come to complain
 ho saktaa he ki kuch yatri lut ke shikaar hue hon lekin wo ab tak police ke paas nahin pahunche hai
