 Kung Fu master Jackie Chan was shocked when he heard that kung fu is the art of India
 chini kalakaar chaiyn kaa puraa kariyar isi kung phu kii dein he
 He wonders if the art which he considered to be the gift of China, is in fact a discovery of the neighboring country of India
 jaiki chaiyn do din pehle hi bharat se apane desh laute hai
 He was busy for seven days at several locations in Rajasthan in connection with the film 'baghi'
 isi dauraan unhen actor tiger shroff ke ek bayaan se pataa chalaa ki kung phu bharat kii dein he
 He was also told that the Indian Buddhist saint Bodhidharma had discovered the martial art kung fu
 film unit se jude kuch logon ke mutabik,jaiki shroff ke bete tigrase ye baaten sunakar jaiki chaiyn puure din film ke set par kaam se diverted najar aae
 He told these things over the phone to many close friends from his crew
 kabhi tajjub karte hue, to kabhi hansate hue, maano tiger kii ye baaten unhen hajam nahin huin
 Chain Bachman became so, because he now realized that he had spent nearly half his life thinking that China gave Kung Fu to the world
 chaiyn kaa pareshaan hona laazmi he, kyonki kung phu ke ambender yaa uski parchaai log jaiki chaiyn ko hi maanate hai
 a statement by Rishi Kapoor may once again lead to controversy
 unhone bina kisi kaa naam liye kaha ki industry main kai aise log hai jinhen acting aati hi nahin he
 Recently, Rishi told during an interview that there are many actors in the film industry who do not even know what acting is

 They openly express their opinion on social media
 leading daily ko die gaye ek intervyuu ke dauraan unhone bollywood ke badalte swaroop ke bare main baaten kii
 He said that i always feel that the script of the film is the life of the film
 maine kai sari filmon main kaam kiya, jo ki content par aadhaarit filmein thim
 Rishi, angry with the media, said- how Sridevi suddenly became 'body' Rishi had worked in films like Prem Rog, Damini and Tawaif, which had a lot of power in the script
 unhone kaha ki bhale hi film main ection seens kaa abhaav rahaa ho, par in filmon nen apane content ke dam par badi kamyaabi hasil kii
 Talking about acting, Rishi said that there are many such actors in the film industry who do not know what acting is
 acting ke liye bheekh maangana or tarah-tarah kii siforeeshon ke jariye role paanaa galat tarika he
 An actor must have good acting

 ' hindu janajagran samiti ke adhyaksh milind ekbote or kolhapur shahar main shiv pratishthan ke sansthaapak sambhaji bhide guruji par bhima koregaanv main dange bhadakaane kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he
 a police case was also registered in Pune's Pimpri Chinchwad area for inciting a riot
 lekin milind ekbote ke bhai unhen puri tarah se nirdosh maanate hai
 Milind Ekbote has disappeared ever since the riots have taken place
 shanivaar ko ajtak kii team ne milind ekbote ke bhai se dange bhadakaane ke aaropon par baat kii
 Milind Ekbote's younger brother Nandkumar Ekbote, while clarifying on every question, said, 'milind Ekbote is not one hundred percent, but one thousand percent innocent, because our brother Vadhu had not even gone to Budruk, and even Guruji did not go there
 aamtaur par bhide guruji or hamaara parivaar waha aata-jaataa rahata he, lekin dange ke din hamamen se koi bhi vahaan nahin gaya tha
 There was a religious program in our house for three days
 to tino bhai ghar par hi the
 On 31 December, 1 and 2 January, Pune was at home
 ''jis thali main khate he vahaan ham chhed kyon karenge'milind ekbote ke bhai ne kaha ki pichley pachchis baras se ekbote parivaar vadhu gaanv se judaa hua he
 Together with the Gavalas, the family is doing the samadhi work of Dharamvir Sambhaji Maharaj
 jahaan ham kaam kar rahe hai, waha kyon bigaadenge kaam
 Why do we make holes in the plate we eat? Some people have been gathered and sent there
 ye saraasar galat he or jo bhi video clip viral hui he, uski chaanbin karo or jo bhi massej fail rahe hai, soshal media par usko bhi check karo
 This is the challenge for the media
 'unhone kaha, 'sau saal baad ye duvidha paidaa karnaa ki aap dalit ho, aap maratha ho, ye galat he
 'the battle of Bhima Koregaon which took place two hundred years ago, in which the Peshwas were defeated by the brave Dalit soldiers of the British Army, its pain is still in the mind and that is why the Hindutva organizations have tried to create a ruckus
 is
 is par nandkumar ekbote bole, '200 saal pehle british or bharatiyon main ladaai hui thi, vahaan jaat-paat kaa sambandh nahin aata he, britishars ke saath koun tha or bharatiyon ke saath koun tha ye itihaas ko sabko pataa he
 Now after two hundred years, creating this dilemma in someone's mind, through the fact that you are a Dalit, you are a Maratha, is very wrong
 'ekbote ne kaha ki is yug main ham mangal par jane kii baat kar rahe hai or jaat-paat kaa jhagada karke yahaan kuch aadmi shadyantr kar rahe hai, ye bahut galat baat he
 Our brother and clash Guruji has not done anything like this
 sambhaji maharaj hameshaa hamen prerana dete hai
 It is our job to increase patriotism with them
 soshal media par viral post hamaari nahinjab nandkumar ekbote se poocha gaya ki soshal media par ek post viral hui he or dange bhadakaane ke liye ye post viral kii gai thi
 Dismissing it completely, Ekbote told that in the post it is written that 'chalo Vadhu Budruk' means writing that it is written by people of other languages
 milind ekbote ke samiti ke logamarathihai or wo 'chalaa vadhu budruk' likhenge
 So to make such posts viral is to mislead people
 milind ekbote ko badnaam karne kii manshaa he
 Now it is the job of the cybercrime cell to go to the bottom of this post and punish it severely, which has made this post viral
 milind ekbote chhupakar kyon baithe habgar milind ekbote doshi nahin hai to ve chhupakar kyon baithe hai, is sawaal par ekbote ke bhai ne kaha ki ve sahi samay par baahar aaenge or spashtikaran denge
 Sambhaji Maharaj's Samadhi Inspiration Place When the brother of Milind Ekbote was told that the Vadhu Gram Sabha has passed a resolution that now people will not allow any outside interference in any function in the village i
e
 Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj's death anniversary
 isapar nandakishor ekbote bole ki aisa nirnay lenaa hi haasyaaspad he
 Working on the tomb of Sambhaji Maharaj is not a crime and the villagers will have to decide who is outside
 pehle bhi dange bhadakaane ke aarope lage he ekbote parivaar parabhima koregaanv se pehle pratapgarh ke paas dange bhadakaane ke aarope ko galat bataate hue ekbote bole ke 2003 main vahandanga nahinhua tha, police or kaaryakartaaon ke bich jhadap hui thi
 What happened in 2003 is also a conspiracy
 ekbote parivaar ko badnaam karne kaa jaisaa aaj ho rahaa he
 But when reminded that the two brothers were jailed for 12 days, then Ekbote said that such allegations have been made on many people, such allegations come and go, they have not been proved

 yahi koi 16 saal ke lambey intjaar ke baad congress bihar se aakhirkaar rajyasabha main apana ek saansad bhejne main safal ho gai
 Akhilesh Singh, who belongs to the upper caste Bhumihar caste, became a Congress Rajya Sabha MP from Bihar
 april main party ne ek brahman premuchandra mishra ko vidhaan parishad bhi bheja
 Is giving such a sudden preference to the upper castes is part of any new and bigger political strategy of the Congress? a senior party leader believes that these decisions are being evaluated very seriously and deeply
 ve kehete hai, ''akhilesh or mishra donon isliye jeet paae kyonki unhenlalu prasad yadavake paraamarsh par rajd kaa samarthan praapt ho gaya
 "but the selection of candidates is not an accidental event
" lalu se muslim, yadav or obisi varg ke ek bade vot bank kii 'guarantee' milti dekh congress ne bihar ke savarna voton ko lubhaane par dhyaan lagaaya he jo pradesh main sankhya main beshak bahut zyada to nahin hai magar kaaphi prabhaavshaalee he
 Unlike neighboring Uttar Pradesh, only 11 to 12 percent of Bihar's population is upper caste, but due to the division of lower castes and OBC vote in parties like RJD, LJP, JD (U), RLSP, the importance of upper caste vote is not much
 In spite of increases significantly
 kabhi congress kaa voter rahaa savarna varg 1990 ke dashak ke aakhir main bhaajapa ke saath chalaa gaya
 The RJD and JD (U) tried hard to woo him, yet he stood firmly with the BJP till the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 saal 2000 main rajd ne savarna varg ke garibon ke liye paanch pratishat aarakshan kaa raag bhi chhedaa tha or is varg ko lubhaane ke liye nitish sarkaar ne to agadi jati ayog tak kaa bhi gathan kiya phir bhi savarna vot tus se mas na hua or bhaajapa ke saath bana rahaa
 The bjp's upper-caste vote bank saw a dent in the 2015 assembly elections for the first time when the Congress won 27 seats in an alliance with the RJD and JD (U)
 bhaajapa ke agadon ke vot bank main send lagane ke liye congress ko saajhedaari main zyada siten dena, chunavi ranneetikaar prashanth kishor kii ranneeti thi
 The Congress fielded 16 upper caste candidates, winning 12 of them
 agadi jatiyon main congress ke liye phir se badhati sweekaaryata bhaajapa ke liye ek bada dhakka tha
 a senior RJD leader says that the leaders voted in favor of the Congress in 2015, indicating that they no longer have the same hatred towards Lalu
 sankhya main zyada na hone ke baavjood bihar ke savarna tabake kaa raajnneeti par dabadabaa rahaa he, khaastaur se shahari kshetron main
 Currently, 15 of the 40 Lok Sabha mps belong to the upper castes
 2015 main rajya kii kul 243 vidhansabha siton main se 51 siton par agade varg ke pratyaashee jite
 Yadav, Muslim, upper caste alliances have never been formed in Bihar till date
 yadi koi gathbandhan aisa gathjod kaayam karne main kaamyaab rahata he to is baat par ratti par shaq nahin ki uske virodhiyon kii haalat patali ho jaaegi
 But it is not as if the BJP will be sitting silently on the arm and the opponents will be able to breach its vote bank
 bhaajapa ne bhi 2014 kii apni prachand jeet ko dohraane ke liye apane soshal ejineering ko nae sire se gadhia shuru kar diya he

 report ke mutabik go air ke ko-oner ness wadiya ne priti jinta ke go air main jane se roka laga rakhi he

 Input: IANS F&D yani phenda audio ne haal hi main apane apane W19 bluetooth wireles spikar ko launch kiya tha
 The company has priced it at Rs 2,990
 apni keemat ke hisaab se is wireles spikar main in-bilt FM radio samet dheron fitures die gaye hai
 We have used it for a long time and now we are going to tell you its review
 dizin, bild quality or spacifications:is price range main Boat kaa Stone 700A spikar bhi aata he joki sies main chota he
 On the other hand, it is slightly larger in speaker size and weighs (1
 18kg) bhi he
 Its design is quite premium
 yahaan saamne or peeche donon hi taraf metal gril diya gaya he
 Two 2 in the front in the same grill
 5-int phul-range driver or back main pasive radietters ko jagah di gai he
 Control buttons are placed on the top, where on / off, mode switch, play / pause and volume controls are provided
 wolum controls kaa hi istemaal trek previous / next or FM main stesan change karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 The front panel has been kept quite simple and the F&D logo has been placed in the front bottom
 in batan ko rabar coating ke saath place kiya gaya he or ye upyog main kaaphi aasaan hai
 At the same time, there is a microsd slot, USB port, AUX port and charging port for connectivity in the back panel
 saath hi radio yaa kisi bag kii tarah kairi karne ke liye alag se strap miltaa he, jise aap atech kar sakate hai
 Overall built quality is better and you can carry it in the bag
 spacifications kii baat karen to iskaa total output 12watts RMS he, connactivity ke liye yahaan bluetooth V4
 2 is given
 saath hi yahaan digital FM experience ke liye PLL technology bhi di gai he
 Its battery is 3,000mah and it is quite large
 vahiin Boat Stone 700A main 2000mah kii bydaree milti he
 Performance: Talking about the performance of F&D W19, the 12W output is good according to this price
 chunki is spikar kii sies badi he or back main pasive radietters bhi die gaye hai
 Hence the sound output is quite loud and the bass is also good
 company ne ise EDM, grime or hip-hop jaise johnor ke liye khaas kar banaaya he
 We heard the songs in all popular genres and the problem brought us quality
 yahaan mids clear nahin he
 High notes are good and low notes in lower sound means the base part is good, but as you increase the volume and take it to full, the speaker fails on the bad side
 yani aawaaj fatni lagati he, base kaaphi bhadda lagane lagata he
 Overall sound output is better in slow voice though
 vahiin duusari taraf FM radio kii baat karen to PLL technology kii vajah se kaaphi behatar kaam karata he
 Once set, it saves the station quite easily and gives you a digital experience
 F&D W19 main FM radio kii maujuudagi ise acha vailu for mani point detaa he
 The good thing is that you get better audio quality while playing FM
 bluetooth connactivity main bhi aapako koi dikkat nahin aegi
 Talking about battery performance, we put it comfortably around 8
 5 ghante tak chalaaya he
 Also, let us tell you that microphones have also been provided for calling
 haalanki iskaa upyog kam hi hota he
 Verdict: The F&D W19 is a good speaker with a premium look, where loud sound is available and FM radio is also in the package
 isaki olraol sound quality thik-thaak he
 In higher volumes, the quality of the base is poor and the mid-notes are not clear
 saath hi ye water racistant bhi nahin he
 The Boat Stone 700A may come in handy if you don't want too much loud sound and FM radio and only want better quality

 When asked about replacing Ben Stokes, who performed brilliantly in the first Test, he said, "I felt that i am ready to play physically and mentally
" unase tulana karnaa badi baat he, lekin aap us tareeke se nahin sochate ho
 i did not try to play like them

 pdf 'ade raho' he is baar koun banegaa karodpati 11 kii tagaline
 a game of 16 questions will be played to win 7 crores
 sho ke pehle contestant bane gujarat ke amit rameshbhai jivanani
 Kaun Banega Crorepati, a question-and-answer game released for 19 years, started once again on 19 August
 tivi par gyaan kii 11veen paathshaala pehle kii tarah hi raat 9 baje lagi
 The game started with the powerful voice of KBC magician Amitabh Bachchan
 unhone is baar koun banegaa karodpati kii tagaline, ade raho ko bataate hue ek kavita sunai
 If there is passion, trust in your head and difference, then you will realize where you will stumble and reject
 makasad main sachai he to seenaa thok ke yahi kaho,jhukna hoga duniya tumko vishwaas par apane khadey raho
 Stay sticky, stay sticky, stay sticky
 
 
 duniya badali he jisane bhi pehle usko inkaar mila,apamaanon kaa haar mila or taanon kaa uphaar mila
 Believe in every breath, flow against the waves, with victory torches in your hands
 vishwaas pe apane khadey raho
 Stay sticky, stay sticky, stay sticky
 
 
 apane sapane tum swayan chuno or bun lo vishwaas kii dori se,tum vijay garjana ke nayak, tum ko kya karnaa lori se
 You fly yourself into the perfect, liberated sky of this life, start from today, the new age, and stand in faith
 ade raho, ade raho, ade raho
 
 
 This poem was accompanied by Amitabh Bachchan's entry on the KBC stage
 bhale hi kebisi ke 19 saal ke safar ke saath amitabh bachchan umr ke padaav main aage bad rahe hai
 But there is no shortage in their energy even today
 vahi aawaaj, vahi chaal or deviyon sajjanon ke swaagat, aabhaar, abhinandan ke saath koun banegaa karodpati kaa nayaa adhyay hua shuru
 Who became the first contestant? Amitabh asked the question of Fastest Finger First during the show
 is round ko gujarat ke ek pratiyogi ne jeeta
 Amit Rameshbhai became the first contestant to play a quiz show with Amitabh Bachchan
 ve ek teacher or purv gym trainer rah chuke hai
 The journey of KBC 11 started with its questions and answers
 View this post on instagramahead of tonight's grand launch of # KBC, here's an exclusive preview of the opening of the first episode! Watch # KBC, starting tonight, mon-fri at 9 PM
 @amitabhbachchana post shared bysony Entertainment Television (@sonytvofficial) onaug 19, 2019 at 2:21 am PDT How's the show this time? The 11th season of Kaun Banega Crorepati is like the previous season
 is baar bhi vahiin niyam hai jo pehle ke sijan main dikhe
 In such a situation, the question arises that KBC will get that TRP, because the new season often does not run in the old club
 haalanki is sawaal kaa asli jawaab he amitabh bachchan
 Even though Kalevar is old, the charm of the show is the same today
 sho main kisi bhi contestant ko 7 karod kii rakam jeetne ke liye sawaalon-javaabon ke khel se guzarana he
 The response on the first day of the show has been excellent
 is baat kaa andaja soshal media se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Many screenshots and photos of Amitabh Bachchan's show went viral as the show started
 is baar sho 13 hafton ke safar ko puraa karegaa
 It was announced on the first day
 nae vittvarsh ke bajet ko lekar kayaason kaa daur jari he
 It is certain that the budget will be beyond the people's aspirations, that is, the pockets will be more loose
 vittamantri khud is baat kaa sanket de chuke hai, bajet lok lubhaavan nahin hoga
 That's why people have started worrying from now on
 jahaan tak mahangaai kaa sawaal he, kai tarah ke taxon ke baad lagbhag sava sau sevaaon ko sarvice tex ke daayre main laakar, kamai pehle hi halki kii ja rahi he
 Meanwhile, the United Nations report says that India will be ahead in terms of economy and the rate of production growth in 2016 is 7
 3 va 2017 main 7
 Will be 5
 lekin halaat kuch or hi kah rahe hai, kya lagata he ki aisa kuch ho paaegaa? The markets are deserted
 liwali-bikwaali donon kii kami he
 Gold prices are going down
 steel sector mandi se jujh rahaa he
 The stock market is in a strange mood
 udyogon or kal kaarkaanon kii danvadol sthiti bhi chintajanak he
 From the indications about the budget, it seems that this time there can be an emphasis on increasing government expenditure, because there will be a need for money for the work of recommendations of the Pay Commission, increased pension of soldiers and capital expenditure
 lekin sawaal vahi ki paisa aayega kahaan se? In the budget, emphasis can be placed on increasing investment
 lekin maujuuda halaat main kitna kargar hoga, yah kahana jaldbaaji hogi, kyonki pichley bajet main 69500 karod rupee vinievesh kaa lakshya rakhaa gaya tha jabaki sarkaar mushkil se 12700 karod rupee hi juta pai he
 Here, the disinvestment in the loss making psus failed completely
 aay badhaane ke lihaaj se post offis ko bank main tabdeel karne kii yojana bhi faleebhoot nahin ho pai, jabaki rigerv bank iske liye license bhi de chukaa he
 The biggest challenge in the budget is to make arrangements to reduce corporate tax and move towards GST
 corporate tex main yadi 1 pratishat kii bhi kami hui to sarkari khajaane main 6 se 7 hajaar karod rupayon kii aamad ghategi
 This is definitely a big amount
 is bajet main modi sarkaar dwaara bahuprachaarit kaale dhan ko lekar bhi kathor upaay kiye ja sakate hai
 It is possible that keeping cash in excess of the limit is prohibited
 skool, collejon main donneton ke naam par kaledhan ke len-dein par roak ke liye donneton ko cross check se dena jaruri kiya jaae
 It is estimated that in MBBS admissions, about 12 thousand crore rupees of black money is used in the entire country
 pichley bajet main kalaadhan kaa khulaasa karne, khaas skim laane kaa elaan kiya gaya tha
 The scheme also came, but black money did not come as expected
 mahatvakankshi sona mudrikaran yojana kaa bhi yahi haal rahaa
 The plan came but gold was missing
 yah sab beete bajet kii aadhi adhuri ghoshnaaen hai
 There is a possibility of fixing the desired salary breakup in this budget
 iske liye wo company jisamen 40 yaa adhik karmchaaree hai, tay kar sakengi ki bhavishya nidhi fund main paisa jamaa karnaa he yaa nahin evam swasthya beemaa ke liye manapansad skim bhi chunane kii aazaadee hogi
 In the current financial year, the government is lagging behind the disinvestment target
 shesh do maheenon main sthiti main sudhaar kii gunjaaish bhi nahin dikh rahi he
 In such a situation, the entire person is definitely seen falling on the common man's shoulders
 ho saktaa he, vittamantri ne pehle hi lok lubhaavan na hone vaala bajet kahkar, shaayad yahi sanket diya ho
 The finance ministry and the railway ministry are already in a face-to-face situation regarding cheap rail fares
 sasta yatri kiraaya or saste anaaj dhulaai par di jane vaali sabsidi kiski khate main jaae
 The Ministry of Railways wants the Finance Ministry to take up and the Finance Ministry is not ready
 sabsidi ko lekar is uhapoh ke bich kahin bhaar sidhe aam aadmi ke kandhon par na aa jaae? Here, understanding the gestures of 'deloitte' survey, Indian companies are also afraid of the fear of their loyal employees leaving
 karmchaaree, company main apni bhoomika ko lekar asantusht hai jisaki vajah leadership pojishan ke liye yuvaaon ko protsaahit kiya janaa bataaya gaya he
 It is indeed untold but a matter of concern
 keemton par niyantran, gharelu nivesh badhanaa, nae kal-kaarkaane khulanaa, logon ko naukariyaan milanaa, aam aadmi kii aay badhanaa, jivan str main sudhaar aana hi wo sanket hai, jinase arthvyavastha kii gati maapi jaati he
 Needless to say, what phase are all currently going through
 ab to sabase badi chunauti sarvhaara varg ke chehre par muskaan laane kii he
 What will be done for this is important
 krishi vikaas kii kori baton ko faleebhoot karnaa, kisaanon kii aatmahatya rokna, videshi mudra arjan, export ko badhaava or videshi niveshkon kaa bharat ke prati rujhaan hi aarthik tarakkee kaa mukhya aadhaar he, jabaki vartmaan main sthiti, isse ulat hi dikh rahi he
 The comments daal ke bhav aasmaan chhu rahe hai, gehun, chaaval se lekar sabji or fal, khaadya tel, masaale, duniya main sabase nunatam dar par petrol kii uplabdhta ke baavjood exise duty badhaakar keemten lagbhag jas kii tas rakhana
 The burden of increasing rail, air and road transport is all on the public, while the salary of the people should be doubled in this proportion
 mazdooree kii dar main khaas ijapha bhi nahin hua
 It is natural for the housewives to be worried
 sambhav he ki iskar kii seemaa badhaakar 5 lakh rupee tak kar di jaae, lekin isse aam aadmi ko kya phayda hoga yah aane vaala bajet hi batayega
 Everyone expects common and special budget
 yuva, gruhinee, varisht naagarik, naukareepesha, vyavsaayee, udhyami, sarvice sector sabhi to ummiden lagaae baithe hai
 What will the budget be like, it is just a period of speculation
 bajet lok lubhaavan hoga yaa lok lutaavan, logon kii chintaa abhi se bad gai he
 As far as inflation is concerned, after several taxes, the income is already being reduced by bringing about one hundred and fifty services under the service tax
 is bich sanyukt raashtra sangh kii report main kaha gaya he ki bharat arthvyavastha kii drushti se aage rahegaa tathaa 2016 main utpaadan vruddhi kii dar 7
 3 and 7 in 2017
 5 hogi
 But the situation is saying something else, do you think something like this will happen? bazaar suune pade hai
 Both buying and selling are lacking
 sone ke daam upar neeche ho rahe hai
 The steel sector is reeling
 share bazaar ek ajeeb si uhapoh main he
 The disastrous situation of industries and factories is also worrying
 bajet ko lekar jo sanket mil rahe hai, usase lagata he ki is baar sarkari kharcho ko badhaane par jor diya ja saktaa he, kyonki vetan ayog kii siforeeshon, sainikon kii badi pension or capital expendichar jaise kaamon ke liye dhan kii jarurat to padegi
 But the question is, where will the money come from? bajet main nivesh badaye jane par jor diya ja saktaa he
 But how effective it will be in the current situation, it is too early to say, because in the last budget, a target of disinvestment of Rs 69500 crore was set, whereas the government has barely got Rs 12700 crore
 idhar ghate vaali sarkari companiyon main vinievesh to puri tarah naakaam rahaa
 In order to increase income, the plan to convert the post office into a bank was also not successful, whereas the Reserve Bank has also given a license for it
 bajet main sabase badi chunauti corporate tex ghataane or jiesti kii taraf badhane ke intjaam jaruri hai
 If there is a reduction of 1 percent in the corporate tax, then the government treasury will reduce the income by 6 to 7 thousand crores
 nishchit rup se yah badi rakam he
 In this budget, drastic measures can also be taken by the Modi government regarding the much publicized black money
 sambhav he ki tay seemaa se zyada nakadi rakhane par pabandi lage
 In order to stop black money transactions in the name of donations in schools and colleges, it should be necessary to give donations by cross check
 anumaanath: keval embibies daakhilon main puure desh main lagbhag 12 hajaar karod rupayon kaa kalaadhan istemaal hota he
 In the last budget, it was announced to disclose black money, special scheme
 skim bhi ai lekin, apekshanusaar kalaadhan nahin aayaa
 The ambitious gold monetization scheme remained the same
 yojana to ai lekin sona nadaarad rahaa
 These are half the incomplete announcements of the last budget
 is bajet main manapsand selary brallep tay karne kii sambhaavna he
 For this, the company which has 40 or more employees will be able to decide whether to deposit money in provident fund or not and will also have the freedom to choose the preferred scheme for health insurance
 maujuuda vittvarsh main sarkaar vinievesh lakshya se kaaphi peeche chal rahi he
 There is no scope for improvement in the situation in the remaining two months
 aise main nishchit rup se sara daaromadar aam aadmi ke kandhon par hi padataa dikhaai de rahaa he
 It may be that the Finance Minister has already given the same indication, saying that the budget is not attractive to the public
 saste rail kiraaye ko lekar vitt mantralay or rail mantralay pehle hi aamane-saamne jaise sthiti main hai
 To whose account should the subsidy on cheap passenger fare and cheap grain transportation be made? rail mantralay chahta he vitt mantralay uthaae or vitt mantralay taiyaar nahin he
 Should the burden fall directly on the common man's shoulders amidst this controversy over subsidies? idhar 'deloit' survey ke ishaaron ko samajhen to bhartiya companiyaan apane vafaadaar karmchaariyon ke jane ke bhay se bhi bhaybheet hai
 Employees are dissatisfied with their role in the company, which is said to encourage youth for leadership positions
 yah vaaki ankahi lekin chintaa kii baat he
 Control of prices, increasing domestic investment, opening of new factories, providing jobs to the people, increasing the income of the common man, improving living standards are the signs by which the economy is measured
 kehane kii jarurat nahin ki vartmaan main yah sab kis daur se guzar rahe hai
 Now the biggest challenge is to bring a smile on the face of the proletariat
 iske liye kya kuch kiya jayega yah ahm he
 To foster the core aspects of agricultural development, stop farmer suicides, foreign exchange earnings, boost exports and the tendency of foreign investors towards India is the mainstay of economic growth, whereas at present the situation is looking the opposite
 tippaniyan Prices of pulses have skyrocketed, keeping the excise duty almost as high as it is despite the availability of petrol at the lowest rate in the world, from wheat, rice to vegetables and fruits, edible oils, spices
 rail, hawaii or sadak parivahan main badhotaree kaa sabhi kaa bhaar janata par hi to he, jabaki logon kii tankhwaah is anupaat main doguni honi chahie
 There was also no significant increase in the rate of wages
 gharelu gruhaniyon kii chintaa badhanaa swaabhaavik he
 It is possible that the income tax limit will be increased to Rs 5 lakh, but what will benefit the common man will tell the coming budget
 bajet se aam or khaas sabhi ummiden karte hai
 Youth, housewives, senior citizens, jobbers, businessmen, entrepreneurs, service sectors are all hopeful
 bajet kaisaa hoga ye bas kayaason kaa daur hi he
 Budget will be breathtaking or Lok Lutavan, the concern of the people has just increased

 Your CV is not less than your identity
 chaahe aap apni pehali naukari kii talash main ho yaa phir naukari badalane kii soch rahe hon, in donon hi jagahon par sivi kii bhoomika sabase ahm hoti he
 Everyone's view of cvs is different, but the first step of getting a job starts from here, so here know what you should include and not before sending the final CV
 
 
 jab bhi aap apana sivi bananaa shuru karen to isamen sabase pehle apana naam, pataa, phone number, fax, email jaisi sampark jaankaree ko shaamil karen
 Its length should be specially taken care of while making a CV, because a one-page CV is considered very short, a two-page CV makes it difficult to write all the essentials and a three-page CV is afraid that If the upper limit is not met
 isliye apni jarurat ke hisaab se aapako sivi kii length dyside kerani chahie
 To improve your CV, you can also use the CV of others
 saath hi aap apane professors, offis ke saathiyon yaa seniors kii madad bhi le sakate hai
 After this comes the important part of CV: in this you should start with your current job and working background
 aap jis bhi company main jo bhi kaam kar rahe hai use bullat form main likhen
 Also, give detailed information about recently completed assignments, so that the work done by you in the last few times can be understood better
 sivi main apane job role ke bare main vistaar se likhen, jaise ki agar kisi company ke siio hai to aapke under main kitne logon kii team thi or aap kis project par kaam kar rahe the
 That is to say, do not miss any opportunity to count your achievements in CV
 dhyaan rahe zyada jaankaree dene ke chakkar main margin or phonts ko chota na karen
 Keep your CV simple to read
 agar aap kii baat ek pej main puri nahin aa rahi he to beshak aap duusare pej kaa istemaal kar sakate hai, lekin ek baar apane aap se soche jarur ki kya ye extra jaankaree vaaki kaam kii he bhi yaa nahin
 Give full details of career and studies in your CV, because employers do not like any kind of gaps in it
 jab aap apana sivi khatm karne ja rahe hon to uske ant main jaruri extra jaankaree jaise aapaki hobbi-intrest kya he, aapaki date of berth or maujuuda adress kya he, likhnaa na bhoolen
 Once the CV is completed, read it carefully
 kahin kuch chhot na rahaa ho iske liye do-teen baar pard lenaa acha rahata he
 If the employer sees mistakes like spelling mistakes or typographic errors in your CV, then your impression goes wrong
 ghotaale se ghire punjab and maharashtra kooparative (piemasi) bank kii 64 varshiya jamakarta kii padosi navi mumbai main dil kaa daura padane ke kaaran maut ho gayi
 His family gave this information on Friday
 bank main 4,355 karod rupee kaa ghotaalaa saamne aane or arabiai dwaara dhan nikasi par lagaae pratibandhon ke baad kuldeep cor vij (64) piemasi bank kii saatvin jamakarta hai jinaki maut ho gayi he
 Kaur, who lives in Sector 10 in Kharghar area of navi Mumbai, died in a hospital on Tuesday night
 unke pati varinder singh vij (74) ne bataaya ki vah bank main apana paisa fanse hone ko lekar chintit thi or tivi par jamakartaon ke pradarshan ke bare main khabaren dekhne ke baad thodaa tanaav main thim
 He said that Kaur was admitted to the hospital but was declared dead during treatment
 jitibi nagar main guru teg bahadur hai skool main coach ke taur par kaam karne vaali vij kaa piemasi bank main vetan kaa khaataa tha
 "we did not have the money to pay the health insurance installment," he said
 abhi tak saat jamakartaon kii maut ho chuki he
 How many more deaths does the bank need? '' mujhako sanam mili yaa meri rusavaai ho, kuch tarruf bhala is baat se kya he mujhakochand lamhe to meri umr main aise aae, jisamen dushmano se bhi bahut pyaar mila he mujhakokis tarah umr kaa dushwaar safar tay hoga, bich raste main koi chhod gaya he mujhako5 agast ko lakhanu menjaneshwar mishra smriti samaaroh main amar singh yah sher padhakar baitheto uttar pradesh main ek nai siyaasi halchal tej ho chuki thi
 In the presence of Mulayam on the stage, this lion had said a lot
 ye kayaas or tej ho gaye jab mangalvaar subah amar singh apane puraane 'bos' mulaayam singh se milane unke ghar ja pahunche
 The cycle of speculation intensified when the SP president made Amar Singh sit in the car and left with him to the party office
 lekin iske thik baad amar singh ne kaha ki yah anaupchaarik or maitreepurn mulaakaat thi or vah sapa main shaamil nahin ho rahe hai
 He said, 'I met three different people over breakfast with my Shivpal, Mulayam Singh and Akhilesh Yadav
 hangaamaa kyon barapa mulaakaat kii he, chori nahin kii, daaka to nahin daalaa or bhugol badla ja saktaa he itihaas nahin
 We have family relations with Shivpal, Mulayam Singh and Akhilesh Yadav
 hamaare bich rajnatik sambandh nahin rahe hai
 It is different that there are political people and i am not a political person
 meri koi rajnatik mahatvakanksha nahin he
 i am a person broken from body and also broken by mind
 aap logon ko vishesh dene ke liye mere paas kuch nahin he
 But Mulayam Singh has given me a lot of love and respect in the past
 jab bhi wo mujhe sidhe bulaayenge or hamaare bich koi dalal nahin hoga to hamaare bich koi duuri nahin hogi
 'amar Singh said,' The meeting you can see is nothing new
 iskaa uttar mujhase kyon puch rahe hai jinhone mulaakaat kii he unase uttar lijie
 Mulayam Singh Ji has the right to publicize the words of the people
 main chahta hum ki kisi kii andekhi na ho nasimuddin sahab ko mayawati mukhyamantri ke rup main pesh karen
 'it is worth mentioning that recently, on 5 August, Mulayam and Amar Singh were seen on a stage after an event organized in memory of Janeshwar Mishra
 yaad rahe ki amar singh ne chaar saal pehle 6 janvari 2010 ko samaajawaadee party ke sabhi padon se istipha de diya tha
 But on 2 February 2010, SP chief Mulayam dismissed him from the party
 amar singh kuch dinon tak raajnneetik rup se niskriy ho gaye
 People said that this was probably the end of his political career
 lekin kuch hi dinon baad unhone apni party bana lee or uskaa naam rakhaa 'rashtriya lok manch'
 But this party also could not return Amar Singh's political spring
 loksabhaa chunaav hi unki aakhri ummid tha
 He joined the Rashtriya Lok Dal along with his close leader Jaya Prada
 party ne unhen fatehpur sikri se chunaav maidan main utaara, lekin vahaan bhi unhen karaari haar naseeb hui
 Political experts believe that both Mulayam and Amar have less political influence at the moment and the same thing can bring them back together
 mulaayam singh kii samaajawaadee party kaa bhi uttar pradesh ke loksabhaa chunaavon main bura haal hua or vah sirf 5 siton par simat gai
 Also, the incidents of crime in the state has created an anti-incumbency in the state, which Mulayam would not like to ignore
 ek vajah yah bhi he ki bure daur main do puraane mitra beeti baaten bhulaakar saath aate najar aa rahe hai

 Above all, a struggle

 It cannot be generalized

 Not only this, he also had to face slavish remarks

 Explain that while carrying goods in the ship, you cannot travel with a bag of size and weight over a specified limit
 View this post on instagramsubject: # Qantas airways @qantas This should get your attention! Travelling from Sydney to Melbourne and at the check in counter met a grumpy # Mel ( that’s her name)who decided it was “OK” to speak curtly to “US” ( Brown people!!) travelling together ,I was flying business and had 2 bags (my allowance)and she insisted and decided my half empty Duffel bag was oversized( to check in!!) So she sent us to check it in at the other counter dealing with “oversized luggage” 
 
 there a Polite lady(yes this one was) said 
 
 ”this ISN’T an oversized bag, pls check this in manually if u can at another counter” ( all this happening while the counter is going to shut in 5 mins) As the manual check in wasn’t going thru for 5 mins( we tried) i went upto # Mel and requested her to put the bag thru as her colleague said it wasn’t an oversized bag
 
 She refused again
 
 Just being adamant especially when i told her this is causing a lot of inconvenience 
 
 We had no time to waste so we ran to the oversized baggage counter and requested her to put the bag through which she did after i told her that # Rude # Mel had issues !!!
 
 
 
 to which another colleague joined in an reiterated my duffle wasn’t oversized and could’ve easily been checked in
 The point is
 
 This piece is only for # quantas airlines to know and take cognisance
 
 that their staff must be taught to be helpful and TONE can't change with preference to # COLOUR
 ”WE” are NOT # pushovers and they MUST know that being # callous and # Rude will NOT BE TOLERATED 🙏✋🏼💔
 Ps: Please tell me if that bag in the picture is oversized ?? !! @australia @visitmelbourne @travel # truthmustbetold # bemused # uncalledfor # standup # equality # whatswrongisnotright # instapic # travelwoes # shocking # nightmare # notcoola post shared byshilpa Shetty Kundra (@theshilpashetty) at 6:37 pmttpp 22, 2018 That the bag they had was smaller and lighter than the fixed size
 unhone likhaa ki airport staff ne unke saath budtamiji kii
 While sharing a picture of her with the bag on Instagram, Shilpa has asked the fans whether this bag was really big enough that she could not travel by ship with it? Let me tell you that before this, Shilpa was also a victim of racist comments in the TV showbig Brother, which aired in 2007
 purv cricketer or punjab sarkaar main mantri navjot singh siddhu ko shero-shaayari karte to sab ne dekha he
 But it is hardly known that Navjot Singh Sidhu would wake up at 3:00 am and sit in meditation and meditate for hours
 navjot singh siddhu ke jivan ke kuch anchhue pahaluon ko jaanane ke liye aaj tak samvaadadaata ashok singhl ne puraa din navjot singh siddhu ke saath bitaayaa or jaanane kii koshish kii ki chunavi campan ke dauraan kis dhang se ve apane aap ko taiyaar karte hai
 In the morning, an attempt was made to know from Sidhu what Sidhu does other than a politician, a cricketer and a comedy show
 In response to which many interesting things were learned
 darasal, subah siddhu meditation karte hai
 Sidhu meditates in the morning without wearing a turban
 vahiin siddhu dharm or gyaan ke bare main bhi bakhubi samajha sakate hai
 Sidhu spoke about Sikhism to Sikh Gurus
 mahadev se lekar vaishno devi ke bare main bataaya or kaha ki main ek yogi hum
 Sidhu also said that after meditation in the morning, i get lost for hours and after that i get ready and have breakfast of 6 fruits
 jo ek yogi karata he
 He said i am a yogi, i can also be called a yogi
 siddhu kaa kahana he ki ek samay tha jab vah kisi se baat nahin kar sakate the
 While playing cricket, someone used to run away from giving interviews during the match
 skool college main kisi bhi dibet main bhaag lene ke naam se hi paseene chhot jaae karte the
 But now i can talk for hours
 main koi kitaab pard kar nahin bolta hum
 i do not prepare by writing anything
 yah sab mere meditation or dhyaan kii vajah se hi mujhako hasil hua he
 Sidhu says that whatever shero-shayari i speak, whatever stories i tell, i have inherited it from my father and mother and everything comes out from inside, then i can speak
 meditation karne or naashtaa karne ke baad is chunavi mausam main navjot singh siddhu taiyaar hokar chunavi campan ke liye nikal padate hai
 It is said about Sidhu that on the team he is in, he plays explosive innings and his target is the captain of the opposing team
 ek samay main jab vah bijepi main the to rahul gandhi siddhu ke nishane par hua karte the
 But now Prime Minister Narendra Modi is mostly his target
 chaahe vah road sho ho, chaahe raily ho, siddhu kaa juda andaaj hota he or sabase pehle navjot singh siddhu pradhanmantri modi par hi apana nishaanaa sadhate hai
 Sidhu accuses Modi of vandalism from the people
 unka kahana he ki piem modi ne jo jo vaade kiye the
 Did not complete a single one of it and this time Modi's wind will come out

 rahul ne puraani daleelon ko hi aadhaar banaaya or kaha ki unka makasad supreme court kaa apmaan karnaa nahin tha

 jiske baad bijepi kii minakshi lekhi ne unke khilaaf yachika daakhil kii thi
 On this, Rahul Gandhi was shocked by the Supreme Court and had to regret his statement
 supreme court ne bhi kaha tha ki unhone kabhi aisa (chaukeedaar chor he) nahin kaha he
 However, the Supreme Court was not satisfied with this answer as well so on the appeal of the petitioner, Rahul Gandhi was asked to give his answer again

 As the Lok Sabha elections are getting closer, the activism of the leaders on social media is booming
 jin netaaon ke soshal media handls pichley chaar saalon se 'dhimi gati kaa samachar' bane hue the wo ab prime time news bananaa chahta he
 In such a situation, there has been a growing demand for young people and young people who are active on social media or who understand it
 hamane is aalekh main is dhandhe se judi kuch gudh baton ko pakadaney kii koshish kii he:1
 What should be the rate? Rate is not fixed - it is decided on the status and prudence of the leaders
 har dhandhe kii tarah demand-supplai kaa hisaab he or is par bhi tay karata he ki karanevaala kitna majaboor he yaa kitna samjhauta-patu he!2
 Since it is an indefinite and short-lived action that can have long-term and fatal effects as well, it has an opportunity cost
 yani iskaa ausat rate anya dhandhon kii tulana main kam se kam teen guna hona chahie
 Although this is ideal! 3
 chaar saal pehle ek amir netaa ne mere ek dost ko 30,000 / prati maah ofer kiya tha to jisamen simit post or twit shaamil the

 Each leader has different funds
 atyadhik bujurg kism ke log is madhyam ko nahin samajhate chunki yah madhyam hi abhi thumak chalat ramchandra kii bhoomika main he
 Young leaders, some elderly but mentally young leaders understand this - someone's talk can be made there

 Since it is an image-making business in which all the intellectual energy of a social media worker is used, then its rate should be high
 yah kisi netaa kii arabon ru

 The central government is determined to give Muslim women freedom from triple talaq
 apane masterstroke ke tahat tatkaal teen talaak bill ke sansad main atake rahane ko dekhte hue ab sarkaar is par roak lagane ke liye adhyadesh laa rahi he
 All preparations have been made to bring the ordinance
 haalanki ise lekar samay tay nahin he
 It is being told that the matter was to be discussed in the Union Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, but was postponed due to some reason
 supreme court ke aadesh ke anuroop hi sarkaar is babat vidheyak laa chuki he
 It is pending in Rajya Sabha after it is passed by Lok Sabha
 vipaksh isamen kuch sanshodhan chahta he
 Actually, the triple talaq bill has been passed by the Lok Sabha, but is pending in the Rajya Sabha
 isliye sarkaar ne adhyadesh laane kii puri taiyaari kar lee he
 It is believed that the ordinance will have the same provisions that are in the proposed law and the bill passed by Lok Sabha
 yani teen talaak gaiyr jamaanti aparaadh hoga or usamen doshi ko teen saal tak ke karawas kii sajaa ho sakegi
 The offense will be non-bailable and cognizable
 iske alaava teen talaak se peedit mahila magistrate kii adaalat main guzaara-bhatta or naaballig bacchon kii castady kii maang kar sakati he
 The bill is stuck in balance due to the U-turn of the Congress and the opposition parties in the Rajya Sabha, in fact the masterstroke
 sheetakaaleen satr main bill paas nahin ho sakaa tha
 In such a situation, the Modi government was preparing to run the masterstroke
 bataaya ja rahaa tha ki sarkaar kii is ranneeti se vipakshi dalon kii ek nahin chalegi or jald hi bill ko kanoonee amalijama pahanaaya ja sakegaa
 The Modi government is strongly against the triple talaq and has made it a cause for its reputation
 teen talaak ko jurm ghoshit kar iske liye sajaa mukarrar karne sambandhi bill ko kanoonee amali jama pehanaane ke liye agar vipakshi dalon ke ravaiye main badlaav nahin aata he to modi sarkaar adhyadesh laane kaa daanv chal sakati he
 It is believed that bringing the ordinance is part of the same strategy

 haalanki pradesh congress kii sifarish ke baad wo AICC ke rashtri pravaktaa ke rup main panel main shaamil rahe
 Leader of Opposition TS Singhdev expressed surprise that why Devvrata felt that he was being ignored
 wo pidiyon ke congress ke netaa rahe hai
 He said that Devavrata also has a place in the party and the party respects him, and if anything had hurt him, he should have told him
 party se istipha de dena sahi nahin he
 On the other hand, Pradesh Congress President Bhupesh Baghel said that he has not yet received his resignation
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki unki upeksha jaisi koi baat nahin rahi

 If yes, what is its details? yadi nahin to iske kya kaaran hai
 Responding to how it was launched during the general election 2019, Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar told Lok Sabha on July 12 that Namo TV is not listed in the list of channels of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
 kyonki yah dit operataron kii ore se graahakon ko di jane vaali plateform seva thi
 However, the information and broadcasting minister on behalf of the government did not explain how its broadcasting started during the general election 2019
 bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan namo tivi ke rahasyamay dhang se prasaaran par vipaksh ne hangaamaa kiya tha
 When PM Modi's speech ran on this channel, many leaders including Rahul Gandhi had asked the Information Broadcasting Ministry questions about how the channel has been allowed to broadcast by ignoring the rules
 vipaksh ne is channel ko sarkaar kaa propeganda mashin qaraar diya tha
 During that time DTH operators such as Tata Sky, Videocon and Dish TV called Namo TV free to air
 yani ki is channel ko dekhne ke liye upabhoktaaon ko koi paisa nahin dena pad rahaa tha
 This channel was visible across the country

 aligarh muslim uniwarsity main mohammad ali jinna kii tasviir par jari ghamaasan rukne kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 The students of the university demonstrated completely shut down by 12 noon on Saturday night
 bataaya jaataa he ki jinna kii jid kii vajah 1947 main desh bant gaya
 Today, there has been a ruckus about Jinnah from Delhi to AMU
 unke bare main kaha jaataa he ki vah 1947 main hindustan ke bantwaare se teen dashak pehle kuch or the
 In that Jinnah, there was the spirit of fighting for the country and removing the British from India
 us samay jinna ke bheetar desh ke liye ladane or angrejon ko bharat se hataane kaa jajba tha
 The Congress leader with whom Jinnah was most affected was Lokmanya Balgangadhar Tilak
 jab krantikari khudiram bose or prafull chaaki kii faansee kii sajaa hui to tilak ne apane akhbaar kesari main turant swaraj kii maang uthaai thi
 The British prosecuted Tilak for treason in which Jinnah was advocating on his behalf
 lekin jinna tilak ko bachaa nahin paae or wo rajdroh ke maamle main myanmar ke mandley jail main 1908 se 1914 tak chah saal tak kaid rahe
 But after two years when the British once again prosecuted Jinnah for treason, Jinnah again became his lawyer and this time he also saved Tilak
 80 saal se khamoshi main tangi jinna kii ek tasviir par khadbadati siyasatiske baad tilak or jinna ke rishton main itani majbootee ai ki usee saal yani 1916 main hi donon ke bich tilak jinna pact hua
 In it it was decided that both the communities would throw full force for the hindu-muslim unity and fight the British with the same strength
 lekin ye kaam bhi adhuraa rah gaya
 Four years after Faisal, Tilak died in 1920 and Jinnah slowly drifted away from Congress politics
 jiske baad jinna bharat vibhaajan ke sabase bade kaarak bane
 What is the beginning of the entire controversy? BJP MP from Aligarh, Satish Gautam, in his letter to AMU Vice Chancellor Tariq Mansoor, objected to the installation of a picture of the founder of Pakistan on the walls of the office of the University Students' Union
 vishvavidhyalay ke pravaktaa shafe kidawai ne dashakon se lataki jinna kii tasviir kaa bachaav kiya or kaha ki jinna vishvavidhyalay ke sansthaapak sadsy the or unhen chaatrasangh kii aaajeevan sadsyta di gai thi
 Let me tell you, AMU, an important bastion of education in India, is boiling nowadays on the heat of hatred whether Jinnah's picture should remain here or not
 jinna ke baad aligarh main ek or tasviir par vivaad, chaatro ne photographer ko peeta!1936 main hinduon or musalamaanon ke bich maansik bantwaare kii lakeer jinna ne khinch di thi
 Two years after that, this picture was found on this wall of Aligarh University

 Hello, Ravish Kumar
 bina angrezi kaa test die aap hindi kaa patrkaar nahin ban sakate
 This is the truth, but this Hindi journalist is going to argue for the third time in prime time whether IAS can be made without knowing English
 darasal bhashaa ko lekar koi bhi bahes isi tarah ke antarvirodh main fansaa detii he
 You reach where Hindustan started running on 4 November 1948 on its question
 isi din samvidhan sabha main bahes shuru hui thi ki hamaari rashtrabhasha kya ho
 When it started talking about Hindi, the debate went on about which Hindi should be
 imam hossain kehete hai ki gandhi or patel vaali hindustani ho
 Giani Gurmukh Singh Musafir says that Hindustani should be simple
 maine vidhaan ke hindi or urdu anuwaad dekhen hai
 When asked the meaning of Hindi consenters, they could not understand the meaning of Hindi translation
 vakt ne kuch siikhaa hota to 2014 main isi baat par chaatr dharne par nahin baithte ki steel plant kaa anuwaad lohe kaa paudha kaise ho gaya
 Some were supporting Hindustani from the south and some from the north opposed the imposition of Hindi
 jaipal singh ne advaasiyon kii bhashaa kaa bhi sawaal uthaa diya to saiyad karimuddin ne kaha ki rashtrabhasha samvidhan sabha nahin, chuni hui sansad tay kare
 Someone said that Bangla should be the official language
 jawaharlal nehru kehete hai ki agar ham bhashaa badalane ke liye turant jor denge to asankhya matbhedon main funs jaaenge
 Rajeev Ranjan Giri of St
 Stephens College has written a booklet called Constituent Assembly and Bhasha Darshan
 kul milakar yahi nateeja niklaa ki hindi rajbhasha hogi or agle pandrah saal tak angrezi sahyogi rahegi
 But in the sixty-five, there was a flame of anti-hindi, so Nehru gave a statement that we will not implement Hindi as long as a man is also against Hindi
 aaj angreji bos he or hindi ek sahyogi
 At times, the present is similar to history, but the present has new opportunities for intelligence, so it looks something new as well
 aaj rajyasabha main jab dalon ke netao ko do−do minute bolne ke liye kaha gaya to waisi hi chintaaen sawaal or raajnneetik peshbandi dikhi
 Sharad Yadav says that there was no demand for the removal of English
 si-sat kaa paper qualifing kar dijie
 Ramgopal Yadav says that the second paper of C-SAT should be finished
 congress netaa pramod tiwari ne kaha ki lok seva ayog kii parikshaon main kai varshon se bhartiya bhashaaon ke pratiyogiyon kii sankhya ghatati ja rahi he
 The percentage of languages that 95 percent of the population speaks is only 5 to 6 percent
 bispi ke satish mishra ne kaha ki 24 ko imtihaan he or sarkaar ek mid turm formula nikaal rahi he
 The second formula will come out next year
 90 din bahut hote hai kisi sarkaar ko nirnay karne ke liye
 Some were demanding removal of the C-SAT and some to make qualifying
 trinmul congress ke derek o bryan ne kaha ki is maamle kaa raajnneetikaran mat kiijie or na hi chah dinon ke bheetar nipataane kaa prayaas kiijie
 Derek said that Mains can file for the examination in 22 languages of the Eighth Schedule
 yahi suvidha prilims ke liye bhi ho
 Sea set is very good, but if there is a dispute, then the government can assure that it will discuss it further and will come up with some concrete proposals by the winter session
 anna dramuk kevi maitreyan ne kaha ki tamil chaatro ko prilims pariksha tamil yaa angreji main dene kii chhot mili
 DMK MP Kanimoi said that forty percent of the population does not understand Hindi, English
 prilims kii pariksha sirf bhashaa kii jaanch karti he or isi ke aadhaar par bhedbhaav karti he
 cpi's d Raja said that the question paper should be available in 22 languages only for the examination on 24 July
 ye sab bhartiya bhashaa hai
 Not a regional language
 hindi bhi prantiy bhashaa he
 bjp's VP Singh Badnore said that Nepali in 22 languages are also included, so will we include the people of Nepal in this examination too
 rajasthani main ye imtihaan kyon nahin hote jise das karod log bolte hai
 The government said that an all-party meeting will be called
 1948 main ham jo hasil na kar sake use 2014 ne duusare tareeke se hasil kar liya
 At least Indian languages are talking about their interests and today their interests are hitting with English
 bhartiya bhashaaen banaam hindi nahin he
 Rather Hindi is also fighting English along with Indian languages
 bhashaaon kii aisi ekta aapane kab dekhi
 Today, all the languages are tilting the metro train like these passengers of Australia so that the leg of the passenger stuck between the platform and the metro can be removed
 ek train ko jhukaane kaa aisa maanviya nazaaraa aapane kab dekha tha
 When did you see that Tamil, Telugu, Bangla and Hindi are all pulling the legs of the languages stuck in the English metro
 baat sirf bhashaa kii raajnneeti kii nahin he
 It also has utility and employment potential
 purv naukarshah bhashaa nahin balki aaj kii zarurat ke hisaab se is bahes ko dekh rahe hai
 Naresh Chandra, who was India's ambassador to the US, says that a Class One officer should know English
 english comprihension ke sawaal second yaa third divijan se paas dasvin kaa chaatr bhi hal kar saktaa he
 English is the official language in Nagaland Mizoram and Meghalaya
 sarkaar ko samajhaana chahie tha ki angreji zaruri he
 Candidates should be given English coaching for free
 aaj angreji patari se lekar gali mohalle main teen sau se lekar pandrah sau rupee maheene main sikhaayi jaati he
 Chandra says that through C-SAT we are looking for an administrator who can think and analyze
 samajashastri dipankar gupta kehete hai ki aaj angreji ek or bhashaa he
 He meant to say that you should not consider today's English to be the English language of the British government
 times of india kii report main purv mukhya chunaav ayukta en gopalswami kaa bayaan chapa he ki angreji kaa number hataa dene se un chaatro ko madad mil sakati he jinaki shiksha bhashaai skulon main hui he
 You can learn English after selection
 si sat bhashaa ko lekar afasar bhi ek nahin hai
 The leader is also not one
 angreji ke is yug main jahaan hindi waalon ke bachche bhi english medium skulon main padhate hai kya ham vaaki is nishkarsh par pahunch paaenge ki angreji or aptitud hi behatar afasar chunane kii guarantee detaa he

 india today ke anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne paaya ki ye daawa puri tarah jhootha he
 In the audio, it is not the voice of Colombian singer Shakira but the voice of it by the famous Bengali singer Purbi Mukhopadhyay

 hamane kuch news website kireport main payaaki pashchim bengal se rabindra sangeet gayika poorabi mukhopadhyaay kaa 2017 main nidhan hua
 In the same year, Purbi had expressed concern over the false claim about singing in an interview given to The Times of India
 intervyuu main poorabi ne daawa kiya tha ki unhone hazarika ke gane ‘ganga bahati ho kyun’ ko 1999 main record kiya tha or use kai baar hazarika ke saath gaaya
 Hazarika, who was awarded the Bharat Ratna, was influenced by the American artist Paul Robson's song 'ol' Man River '
 unke mega hit 'bistirno Parore' ko pehle asamiya, phir hindi (ganga bahati ho kyon?) or bangla main bhi gaaya
 The most famous song 'ganga Bahati Ho Why?' The lyrics were written by Pandit Narendra Sharma, a big name in Hindi literature and a famous poet

 It is possible that given his death anniversary, this old viral claim was circulated once again, especially on whatsapp

 But is that really Wasseypur? Is there only bloodshed and gang war? Or is reality something else? But was Wasseypur really such a dangerous place? Such a dangerous place where
 
 
 
 Parindas are also at risk of their dignity? The Wasseypur mentioned in the film is in Dhanbad district of Jharkhand
 koyala mafiaon ke khooni itihaas ke saath-saath san santalis kii traasadee, mazdooron par julm, dari-sahami police, bhrasht netaa or bekhauf mafia ko mila kar is film ke jariye vasepur kii tasviir pesh karne kii koshish kii gai he,film gangs of vasepur kii vajah se dhanbad samet puraa koyalanchal in dinon surkhiyo main he
 The reason shown in this is the mutual feud between the two factions and the passion to go to any extent about it
 saath main vasepur kii bolchaal ke naam par parade par istemaal kii gai gaaliyaan or bold dialog
 But the way in which the atmosphere, living and abusive attitude of Wasseypur is shown in the film, it is really far from reality
 film ke mutabik is ilaake main sirf aparaadhiyo kii tuuti bolti he
 According to the film, to get into this locality, one has to take permission first
 is film main vasepur ko gandagi se labarej he or tang-sankari gaaliyon se ata padaa dikhaaya gaya he
 While this is not the reality
 yahaan pakki sadaken or bahumanjili imaaraten hai
 Mohalla is not so dirty
 or sabase badi baat vasepur ke log khuleam din-raat bekhauf kahin bhi ghoomte-phirte hai
 As far as history is concerned, Vase Saheb, a famous builder of Dhanbad, laid the foundations of this locality by cutting the forests here in 1956
 baad main unhi ke naam par is mohalle kaa naam vasepur rakh diya gaya
 It is said that then only a hundred people lived in this locality
 par ab yahaan kii aabaadi kareeb dedh lakh he
 But since the release of the film, this Mohalla has become infamous
 vaase sahab ke ek rishtedaar ke mutabik is film kii vajah se ab ve jahaan bhi jate he log unhen galat nazaro se dekhte hai
 Even now people are refusing to give even their daughter for marriage in Wasseypur
 vaise ye sach he ki beete chaar dashako main yahaan koyala, railway or lohe ke avaidh kaarobaar kii vajah se hui aapasi ranjish main bisiyon qatl ho chuke hai
 Which includes from famous people to small pawns
 lekin ab ye qasbaa ateet ko kahin peeche chhod chukaa he
 Now the living conditions of the people here have changed as compared to before
 padhai ke liye yahaan skool se lekar kalege tak khul chuke hai
 In connection with employment and business, many people of this locality are working in Vidsho
 ab sawaal ye he ki jab vasepur aisa he to phir gangs of vasepur kaise paidaa ho gaya? to isaki bhi puri kahani he
 Actually, the fabric of the fight between the two clans in the film has been woven, both of them are from Wasseypur
 inamen se ek fahim khan is vakt hazaribagh jail main umrakaid kii sajaa kaat rahaa he
 So there is another Sabir Ansari who has recently come out of jail on parole
 fahim khan or sabir ansaari kii isi dushmani par zeeshaan kadri naam ke lekhak ne ek upanyaas likhaa tha
 And this film is made on the same novel
 khud zeeshaan kadri bhi isi vasepur ke rahane vaale hai
 Faheem and Sabir's ancestral house is in the same Qamar Makhduni street of Wasseypur
 police report ke mutabik in donon padosiyon ke bich hue khuni gangvaar main bahut se logon kii jaane gayi
 These included the lives of Faheem's mother, brother and aunt, while on the other hand many of his relatives and pawns including Sabir's brother also killed Faheem's henchmen
 par in katleam ke baad bhi in donon kunbo ke bich kii ranjish kam nahin hui or aaj bhi ve ek dusre ke khun ke pyaase bane hue he
 On the other hand, the common people of Wasseypur say that it was wrong to drag the entire Wasseypur in the ongoing gang war between Faheem Khan and Sabir
 film ke tital se naahak hi ye mohalla badnaam ho rahaa he
 Well perhaps the people of Wasseypur had already guessed what would be shown in the film
 yahi vajah he ki film relies hone ke baavjood is film kaa ek bhi poster vasepur main nahin laga
 Even people went to court to change the name of the film

 Indeed, his success can become an inspiration for anyone
 aapke liye bhi
 But Kapil did not inherit this thing

 This struggle has been 10 years

 With this, his rank can be gauged by the hard work and talent he has earned
 haa, kuch credit ham unkintkhatsmil or kute phase ko de sakate hai
 You can also learn these things and get smiling like them
 apane tallent par bharosakapil sharma ko jisane bhi shuruaati daur main dekha hoga, vah jaanata hoga ki apane kaam or apni lagan par bharosa rakhkar hi vah is mukaam par pahunche hai
 His struggle was also long, but Kapil did not stop laughing

 Accepting the shortcomings, the more confident people are, the more comfortable they are with their lack
 english nahin bol pate, to apana majaak banane main bhi peeche nahin rahete
 Surely, they are just trying to fix it

 Excellent Observation Power is very careful to notice any thing, action or thing closely Kapil and such people are able to do that which is alert all the time
 jaahir he, jab aap choti-choti baton kii vyavhaarik parakh rakhenge to jindagi main kabhi maat nahin khaaenge

 Do not take things to heart, there are some controversies related to him during Kapil's career
 kabhi koi naaraaz hua to kabhi kisi ne kuch coment kar diya
 But Kapil did not take such things to heart and Ignore them, just kept an eye on his target

 The Rokarnataka government appointed former advocate general BV Acharya as special public prosecutor on the case for five years
 lekin jab aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main landan hotels kaa maamla jod diya gaya to jhatka laga
 The prosecution suffered a setback because the London Hotels case was not so substantive and the two cases had separate transactions

 - Input IANS bharat ke do pradhanmantri hai
 One is the Hindi-speaking Prime Minister Mr
 Narendra Modi and the other is the English-speaking Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 ek jo gaanv gaanv main hindi bolte hai or duusare jo antarrrashtriya sabhaaon main angreji bolte hai
 Literature, filmmakers and journalists are discussed in the development and expansion of language in our country, but the contribution of leaders is less discussed
 pradhanmantri bhashaa kaa bhi pratinidhitiv karte hai
 Evaluation should also be done on this basis from time to time
 bhartiya janata party ke donon pradhanmantri bhashaa ke lihaaz se ek duusare se kaaphi alag hote hue bhi purna rup se sakasham netaa rahe hai
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Hindi is much richer than Narendra Modi's Hindi but Vajpayee's Hindi is tied to nobility and literacy
 vaajapeyi kii hindi vipaksh ke netaa ke taur par bhi maryaada or javabdehi se bandhi hoti thi or pradhanmantri banane ke baad bhi waisi hi rahi
 He was also a leader and a poet while speaking Hindi
 unke paas kai tarah kii hindi thi
 Gandhinagar MP Lal Krishna Advani's Hindi was good, but Vajpayee's Hindi was less discussed in front of him
 adwani kii hindi main vishwasaneeyata or swaabhaaviktaa kaa abhaav he
 He speaks good Hindi but could not strike a synergy between Tatasam and Tadbhav
 unki hindi sangh ke swayamsevak kii tarah he jo ek khaas kism ke kritrim prashikshan se banati he
 Hindi of many Sangh leaders is similar to Advani
 adwani ne bhashaa se kam apane kad se zyaada pahchaan banaai
 Even when he speaks English, he is not able to get ahead of the fascination of personal status
 vaajapeyi bhi swayamsevak the lekin unki hindi rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii nahin he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindi is very different from his two seniors
 gujarat ke bheetar ve gujarati main sabhaayen karte the
 For twelve years he projected himself as a Gujarati-speaking leader
 chah karod gujarati asmita kii daavedaari hindi se nahin mil sakati thi 
 In the year 2013, when he started claiming Delhi, his Hindi work was very useful but the style remained the same as it was in Gujarati
 do alag bhashaaon main awaz se lekar haav bhav tak gazab kii nirantarata dikhi
 In the Lok Sabha elections, he was also seen taking the attitude of Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 modi ke bhaashan main tathyaatmak galatiyon, tark-kutark, raajnneetik chalbaasiyon or samudaayon ke samavesikaran ke masale par alag se likhaa janaa chahie, vah galat bolne se nahin chookte
 The public is fascinated by his style of speech, so he examines the facts less like opponents! By the way, even opponents do not do it properly
 vaajapeyi ke napathy main chale jane se rashtriya str par hindi kamazor pad gai thi
 PV Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh were scholars of many languages but both neither identified as Waqt nor recognized any one language
 is maamle main sonia gandhi kii hindi saraahneey rahi
 He had a desire in Hindi, people appreciated his efforts and gave him power twice
 vah likhakar padhati thi lekin bolne ke andaaz main vah apni party ke tamaam netaaon par baari pad jaati hai
 The feeling of creating a punch line in them is much better than leaders like Salman Khurshid, who speaks Hindi and Urdu
 vaise salmaan kurshid bolte hue behad saadhaaran or prabhaavaheen netaa lagate he
 i will write separately on the language of Congress leaders
 vaajapeyi ke baad hindi bolne vaale kai netaa kshetreey dalon main the lekin unki hindi kii bhi apni simaaen raheen hai
 However, many of them were leaders born of self-respect of Hindi or opposition to English
 abhi un par bhi vistaar se charchaa nahin karnaa chahta
 Just want to say that there was no urgency, naturalness, imagination and readiness in them
 ve apni bhashaa se kam apane saamaajik aadhaar ke dam par netaa rahe
 Linguists should study whether Arvind Kejriwal's Hindi aggression in the year 2011-2012 influenced Narendra Modi or that there was some kind of linguistic competition between the two that in the same way shouting, shouting and shouting Has to be filled
 kejariwal kii hindi, satta ko lalkaar rahi thi to modi kii hindi ne satta ke pratikon ko dhahaana shuru kar diya
 He resorted to Hindi to establish himself at the national level and assured the Hindi speakers that in this era of liberalization, when it is considered natural to speak English, he can still challenge with Hindi
 hindi bolne vaala angrezi par varchasv qaayam karne kii kuntha se bharaa rahata he jise kabhi swabhimaan to kabhi rashtrawaad ke rup main samajhataa he
 In 2014, the Prime Minister's Hindi frightened the linguistic elites of Lutyens' Delhi
 jo is dar ko sweekaar nahin karnaa chaahate the, ve modi ko bahari kehane lage jabaki yah baat puri tarah satya nahin he
 Modi had gone to Gujarat from Delhi but returned when he was outsider! His speech at election rallies began to be prolonged
 log der tak unki hindi ko notice karne lage
 The aristocracy of Hindi born out of liberalization started gaining confidence through their Hindi which was subdued by the British of UPA
 pradhanmantri banate hi sabko laga ki dilli ab hindi bolegi
 This is so to a large extent, but Delhi still speaks in English
 dilli kii satta puraani hoti he to angreji ho jaati he
 If it is new, it looks like Hindi
 dilli or bihar ke chunaav pradhanmantri kii hindi ke lihaaz se mahatvapurn hai
 In both places, his Hindi worked against him
 dilli main logon ne dekha ki vinamrata nahin he or bihar main log kehane lage ki pradhanmantri kii garima nahin he
 In these two elections, i saw the same people checking the copy of their language, who were being given numbers without seeing it
 log unki hindi main shaleenta khojane lage
 However, his Hindi in election rallies is still the same as it was in Lok Sabha elections
 bas bheed acchhee honi chahie
 While speaking Hindi in government programs, he takes care that he is the Prime Minister but in the middle he speaks like a leader as if sweets have stopped eating! i will again write separately on his Hindi in Parliament
 aisa nahin he ki videsh daure par pradhanmantri hindi nahin bolte lekin vahaan do prakaar kii hindi bolte hai
 One is when he addresses a community of Indian origin and the other when he answers media queries from the official residence or office of a nation's head in Hindi
 us vakt unki hindi us narendra modi ke jaisi nahin hoti jo reliyon main dahaadte hai lekin jaise hi koi stadium miltaa he ve medicin or mokama ke fark ko bhul jate hai
 They are free from the power of Hindi
 satta kii angreziyat to ham jaanate hai lekin satta kii hindiyat par kam baat karte hai 
 Now i come to Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi who speaks English abroad
 pradhanmantri ko angrezi aati he phir bhi vah angrezi main likhaa bhaashan padhate hai
 Mr
 Modi has used technology to establish himself as an English-speaking leader
 unke saamne ek paardarshee takhti lagi hoti he jis par likhaa dekhakar wo bolte hai
 If you speak a sentence with a right, then you turn to the left for the next sentence
 ve angrezi bolte hue hindi vaale modi se kaaphi alag ho jate hai
 Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a great desire to speak English
 ve bahubhashi netaa hai
 Gujarati, Hindi and English are contested
 in dinon gaalib or sufi santon ke qalaam par bhi mehnat karne lage hai! lekin jab vah angreji bolte hai to technology unhen baandh detii he
 Looks like a new iphone has arrived
 angreji bolte vakt unki dehbhasha sikud jaati he
 Like when a dhoti kurta is worn for the first time in a tight Prince suit
 jahaan khadey hote hai vahaan se hilte dulte nahin
 They use the small space of the big stage and try to enlarge themselves through speech
 vah sanyukt raashtra sangh main hindi main bole or amareeki congress ke saamne angrezi main
 Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not want to carry the pride of Hindi all the time
 unke liye hindi bhi ek avasar he or angrezi bhi
 He does not want to carry those orthodox symbols of Hindi that if he goes abroad, he comes by speaking Hindi
 amareeki congress main ghuste hi vah saansadon se haath milaane lage
 In an instant, the British dominated their attitude
 'kool' netaa banane kii dehbhasha hindi main bhi he yaa ho sakati he lekin mistar modi kii bhashaa or dehbhasha duusari bhashaaon ke 'kooltv' ( kool angrezi shabd he) ko apana leti he
 Mr
 Modi is a leader full of immense ambitions
 nitant nijee hone ke baad bhi vah apni mahatvakankshaon kii frenchizi apane samarthakon main baant dete hai! He may be anti-nehru but speaking in English, he wants to touch the height of Nehru's speeches
 unke jis jacket ko modi jacket kaha jaataa he vah aadhunik bhartiya raajnneeti ke aadikaal main nehru jacket hi kehalaata tha
 Modi wants the country and the world to see him as a Statesman
 afghanistan or amareeki congress main diya gaya unka bhaashan bhale hi unka na likhaa ho lekin kisi bhi paimaane se stareey tha
 He was going to touch the stage he wants
 mistar prime ministar modi angrezi ko angrezi kii tarah nahin bolte
 While speaking English, he is free from the discomfort of acquiring the accents that everyone nowadays suffers from
 vah apni angrezi se sunne vaale ko 'elionet' yani alag-thalag nahin karte hai
 But it felt a bit like he wanted to be 'accepted' in English! Is also natural
 vaise hindi main hota to is bhaashan kii gaanv gaanv main charchaa hoti lekin america or duniya main asar nahin hota
 In the US Congress, he wanted to go beyond the Prime Minister or Prime Minister
 chale bhi gaye
 In Hindi speaking houses there is no difference from English, but style English seems to indicate that the boy is gone
 bhale hi vah kitna hi kaam vaala ho 
 Mr
 Modi speaks English like Hindi
 thode sikude sikude se sarkaar nazar aate hai lekin sanbhal sanbhal kar apni baat kah jate hai
 Even if there is no naturalness, but there is seriousness
 ve angrezi par apni chhap chhod rahe hai
 His team seems to have good people writing English
 thodaa itihaas kii behatar samaj vaale log bhi hone chahie jo konark mandir ke kaal ko galat na likhe or apane netaa kii jagahansai na karaayen
 Prime Minister Modi should form a team of historians called Lefts! amareeki congress main unka bhaashan kootnithik lihaaz se bharat kii videsh niti ko america ke saamne aabhaar-niti ke rup main prakat karata he to bharat ke liye swatantra rekhaaen bhi khinchataa he
 He knows the art of preserving his natural freedom
 isliye angrezi bol rahe the lekin is baat se bephikr rahe ki mesachusets jaise mushkil uccharan ko kaise saadhaa jaae
 Just moved ahead by speaking
 har lafz or vaakya ko gambhirtha dene kaa prayaas kiya
 Manmohan Singh's speech at the US Congress was good, but Mr Prime Minister Modi made his speech memorable with his typical English speech more than his Nafees English speech
 angreziyat bhi desi or theth ho sakati he
 If you are not smitten, then the listeners remain tight! bharat-amareeki sambandhon ke pench bhaashanon se deele nahin honge
 America is basically a merchant country
 bharat prayasarat he ek vyapaaree desh main tabdeel hone ke liye
 It will talk about culture and culture, but its business policies are becoming aggressive
 prakruti kii puja kii baat hogi lekin uske dohan kii nishthurata bhi dikh jaaegi, agar koi dekhnaa chaahe to
 India is now a partner country of USA
 america bharat ke madhyamvargeey nagarikon kii mahatvakanksha he or ab rashtriya mahatvakanksha main badal rahaa he
 We are using it or they will continue to share this scholar of ours
 meraa maqasad sirf itnaa tha ki pradhanmantri kii bhashaa or style ko rekhaankit kiya jaae
 Their thought flow should be understood based on the external form of language
 kya aapako bhi pradhanmantri shri narendra modi or mistar prime ministar narendra modi main koi fark lagata he? Both the Prime Ministers of the Bharatiya Janata Party have been completely capable leaders, despite being quite different from each other in terms of language
 atal bihari vaajapeyi kii hindi narendra modi kii hindi se kahin zyaada samrudh he lekin vaajapeyi ji kii hindi kuleenata or saahitiyikta se bandhi he
 Vajpayee's Hindi as leader of the opposition was also bound by dignity and accountability and remained the same even after becoming the Prime Minister
 vah hindi bolte vakt netaa bhi hote the or kavi bhi
 He had many types of Hindi
 gandhinagar ke saansad laal krishna adwani kii hindi acchhee thi lekin vaajapeyi kii hindi ke saamne unki hindi kii kam charchaa ho saki
 Advani lacks credibility and naturalness in Hindi
 vah acchhee hindi bolte to he lekin tatsam or tadbhav ke bich talmail nahin bitha sake
 He is like a Swayamsevak of Hindi Sangh who is made with a special type of artificial training
 sangh ke kai netaaon kii hindi adwani se milti julati he
 Advani made more than his stature less than language
 vah angreji bolte vakt bhi vyaktigat haisiyat ke moh se aage nahin nikal pate hai
 Vajpayee was also a volunteer but his Hindi is not from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii hindi apane in donon varishton se kaaphi alag he
 Within Gujarat he used to hold meetings in Gujarati
 baarah saal tak unhone khud ko gujarati bolne vaale netaa kii tarah pesh kiya
 Six crore Gujarati Asmita's claim could not be obtained from Hindi
 2013 ke saal main jab dilli kii daavedaari karne lage tab unki hindi bahut kaam ai lekin style vahi rahi jo gujarati main thi
 There was a continuity of ghazab in two different languages from voice to howl expressions
 loksabhaa chunaavon main kahin kahin vah atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa haav-bhav bhi lete dikhe
 Modi's speech should be written separately on the issue of factual mistakes, arguments, political manipulation and inclusion of communities, he does not fail to speak wrongly
 janata unke bhaashan style par mohit rahati he isliye virodhiyon kii tarah tathyon kii kam jaanch karti he! vaise virdohi bhi thik se nahin karte
 At the national level, Hindi was weakened by Vajpayee's departure
 pi ve narsimha raav or manmohan singh kai bhashaaon ke vidwaan rahe lekin donon ne na to vaqta ke rup main pahchaan banaai na hi kisi ek bhashaa ko pahchaan di
 Sonia Gandhi's Hindi in this matter was commendable
 unki hindi main ek chaah thi, logon ne unki koshish ko saraahaa or do baar satta di
 She used to read by writing but in terms of speaking she overshadows all the leaders of her party
 unamem panch line paidaa karne kaa bodh nafis hindi or urdu bolne vaale salmaan khurshid jaise netaaon se kahin behatar he
 By the way, Salman seems to be a very simple and ineffective leader while speaking cheerfully
 congress netaaon kii bhashaa par alag se likhuunga
 After Vajpayee, many Hindi-speaking leaders were in regional parties, but they also have their limitations in Hindi
 haalanki unamem se kai hindi ke swabhimaan yaa angrezi ke virodh se paidaa hue netaa rahe
 Right now i do not want to discuss them in detail
 bas itnaa kahana chahta hoon ki unamem taatkalikta, swaabhaaviktaa, kalpanashiltaa or tatparta nahin thi
 He remained a leader on the basis of his social base less than his language
 bhashashastriyon ko is baat kaa adhyayan karnaa chahie ki kya 2011-2012 ke saal main arvind kejariwal kii hindi kii aakraamakata ne narendra modi ko prabhavit kiya yaa donon ke bich kisi kism kii bhashaai pratispardhaa hui ki ek hi tarah se chikh kar bolnaa, lalkaarna or hunkaar bharna he
 While Kejriwal's Hindi was defying power, Modi's Hindi started demolishing symbols of power
 unhone khud ko rashtriya str par sthapit karne ke liye hindi kaa sahaara liya or hindi bolne vaale ko bharosa diya ki udaarikaran ke is daur main jab angreji bolnaa swaabhaavik maan liya gaya he vah ab bhi hindi se chunauti de sakate hai
 The Hindi-speaking English is full of frustration to dominate the English, which sometimes considers self-respect and sometimes as nationalism
 saal 2014 main pradhanmantri kii hindi ne lutian dilli ke bhashaai kulinon ko daraa diya
 Those who did not want to accept this fear started calling Modi an outsider even though this is not completely true
 modi dilli se hi gujarat gaye the lekin laute to bahari ho gaye ! chunavi reliyon main unka bhaashan lanbaa hone laga
 People started noticing his Hindi till late
 udaarikaran se paidaa hua hindi kaa kuleen unki hindi ke zariye aatmavishvaas paane laga jo upie kii angrejiyat se dab gaya tha
 As soon as he became Prime Minister, everyone felt that Delhi would now speak Hindi
 bahut had tak aisa he bhi lekin dilli ab bhi angrezi main hi baat karti he
 When the power of Delhi becomes old then it becomes English
 nai hoti he to hindi lagati he 
 The elections in Delhi and Bihar are important for the Prime Minister's Hindi
 donon jagahon main unki hindi unke kilaaf kaam kar gai
 People in Delhi saw that there is no humility and in Bihar people started saying that the Prime Minister has no dignity
 in do chunaavon main maine usee janata ko unki bhashaa kii copy check karte dekha jo bina dekhe number diye ja rahi thi
 People began to find his decency in Hindi
 haalanki chunavi reliyon main unki hindi ab bhi waisi hi he jaisi loksabhaa chunaavon main thi
 The bus crowd should be good
 sarkari kaaryakramon main ve hindi bolte vakt khyaal rakhte hai ki pradhanmantri hai lekin bich bich main netaa kii tarah bol jate hai jaise mithai khaanaa band kar diya he ! sansad main unki hindi par phir kabhi alag se likhuungaa
 It is not that the Prime Minister does not speak Hindi while traveling abroad, but there speak two types of Hindi
 ek jab vah bhartiya mul ke samudaay ko sambodhit karte hai or doosraa jab vah kisi raashtra pramukh ke sarkari awaas yaa daftar se media ke sawaalon kaa jawaab hindi main dete hai
 At that time, his Hindi is not like that of Narendra Modi who roars in rallies but as soon as a stadium is found they forget the difference between Madison and Mokama
 satta kii hindi se azaad ho jate hai
 We know the English power but we talk less on the Indian power
 ab aata hum mistar prime ministar narendra modi par jo videshon main angrezi bolte hai
 The Prime Minister knows English, yet he reads the speech written in English
 mistar modi ne khud ko angreji bhashi netaa ke rup main sthapit karne ke liye technology kaa sahaara liya he
 There is a transparent plank in front of them, on which they speak by looking at it
 ek vaakya daayen mud kar bolte hai to agle vaakya ke liye baayen mud jate hai
 He is quite different from the Hindi-speaking Modi who speaks English
 mistar prime ministar narendra modi ke bheetar angrezi bolne kii athaah chaah he
 He is a multilingual leader
 gujarati, hindi or angrezi main taqariren karte hai
 These days, Ghalib and Sufi have also started working on the penance of saints! But when he speaks English, technology binds him
 aisa lagata he haath main nayaa nayaa yphone aayaa ho
 His body language shrinks while speaking English
 jaise kisi dhoti kurte vaale ko pehali baar tite prince suut pahana diya gaya ho
 There is no moving where you stand
 bade manch kii choti si jagah kaa istamaal karte hai or bhaashan ke zariye khud ko bada karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 He spoke in Hindi in the United Nations and in English in front of the American Congress
 mistar prime ministar narendra modi har samay hindi ke swabhimaan ko nahin dhonaa chaahate
 For them, Hindi is also an opportunity and English too
 vah hindi ke un roodhiwaadee pratikon ko nahin dhonaa chaahate ki videsh gaye to hindi bol kar aa gaye
 As soon as he entered the US Congress, he started shaking hands with mps
 ek pal main unke haav-bhav par angreziyat haaavee ho gai
 The language of becoming a 'cool' leader is or may be in Hindi, but the language and body language of Mr
 Modi adopts 'coolattva' (cool is the English word) of other languages
 mistar modi aseem mahatvakankshaon se bhare netaa hai
 Despite being extremely private, he shares the franchise of his ambitions among his supporters! vah bhale hi nehru virdohi hon lekin angrezi main bolte hue vah nehru ke bhaashanon kii oonchai ko chhu lenaa chaahate hai
 His jacket, which is called Modi Jacket, was called Nehru Jacket in the modern Indian politics
 modi chaahate hai ki desh or duniya unhen statsman ke rup main dekhe
 His speech delivered in Afghanistan and the US Congress may not have been written by him, but it was level by any scale
 us muqaam ko chhu lene vaala tha jo vah chaahate hai
 Mr
 Prime Minister Modi does not speak English like English
 angrezi bolte vakt vah un uccharanon ko hasil karne kii bechaini se mukt hai jinase aajkal har koi grasit he
 He does not alienate the listener from his English
 lekin thodaa sa laga ki vah angrezi main 'accomodate'( sweekrut) hona chaahate hai! swaabhaavik bhi he
 If it were in Hindi, this speech would have been discussed in every village, but it would not have any effect in America and the world
 amareeki congress main vah pradhanmantri yaa prime ministar se aage janaa chaahate the
 Gone too
 hindi bhashi gharon main angrezi se duraav nahin he lekin style vaali angrezi se lagata he ki ladkaa gaya kaam se
 No matter how useful he is
 mistar modi angreji ko hindi kii tarah bolte hai
 The government seems to have shrunk a little, but is careful and says its point
 bhale hi sahajata na ho lekin gambhirtha rahati he
 They are leaving their mark on English
 lagata he ki unki team main angrezi likhane vaale achche log hai
 There should also be people with a little understanding of history, who do not write the period of Konark temple wrong and replace their leader
 prime ministar modi ko un itihaaskaaron kii team bana leni chahie jinhen left kaha jaataa he !tippaniyan His speech at the US Congress reveals India's foreign policy as a policy of gratitude to the US in diplomatic terms, and also draws independent lines for India
 vah apni swaabhaavik swatantraaa ko bachaakar rakhane kii kala jaanate hai
 That's why he was speaking English but was unsure of how to pronounce a difficult accent like Massachusetts
 bas bolkar aage bad gaye
 Tried to give seriousness to every word and sentence
 amareeki congress main manmohan singh kaa bhaashan acha tha lekin mistar primaministar modi ne unki nafis angrezi ke bhaashan se zyaada apni theth angreziyat se apane bhaashan ko yaadgaar bana diya
 The English can also be native and typical
 thasak na ho to sunne waalon main kasak rah jaati he! The screws of indo-us relations will not be let loose by speeches
 america mulat: ek vyapaaree desh he
 India is trying to convert into a merchant country
 baat sanskaar or samskruti kii karegaa lekin uski vyapaarik nitiyaan aakraamak hoti ja rahi hai
 There will be talk of worshiping nature, but the ruthlessness of its exploitation will also be seen, if anyone wants to see
 bharat ab america kaa partner desh he
 America is the ambition of middle class citizens of India and is now turning into national ambition
 ham uskaa istemaal kar rahe hai yaa ve hamaara ye vidwaan baanchate rahenge
 My aim was only to underline the language and style of the Prime Minister
 bhashaa ke bahya rup ke aadhaar par unke vichaar pravaah ko samajha jaae
 Do you also find any difference between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi? gandhinagar ke saansad laal krishna adwani kii hindi acchhee thi lekin vaajapeyi kii hindi ke saamne unki hindi kii kam charchaa ho saki

 unhone khud ko rashtriya str par sthapit karne ke liye hindi kaa sahaara liya or hindi bolne vaale ko bharosa diya ki udaarikaran ke is daur main jab angreji bolnaa swaabhaavik maan liya gaya he vah ab bhi hindi se chunauti de sakate hai
 The Hindi-speaking English is full of frustration to dominate the English, which sometimes considers self-respect and sometimes as nationalism
 saal 2014 main pradhanmantri kii hindi ne lutian dilli ke bhashaai kulinon ko daraa diya
 Those who did not want to accept this fear started calling Modi an outsider even though this is not completely true
 modi dilli se hi gujarat gaye the lekin laute to bahari ho gaye ! chunavi reliyon main unka bhaashan lanbaa hone laga
 People started noticing his Hindi till late
 udaarikaran se paidaa hua hindi kaa kuleen unki hindi ke zariye aatmavishvaas paane laga jo upie kii angrejiyat se dab gaya tha
 As soon as he became Prime Minister, everyone felt that Delhi would now speak Hindi
 bahut had tak aisa he bhi lekin dilli ab bhi angrezi main hi baat karti he
 When the power of Delhi becomes old then it becomes English
 nai hoti he to hindi lagati he 
 The elections in Delhi and Bihar are important for the Prime Minister's Hindi
 donon jagahon main unki hindi unke kilaaf kaam kar gai
 People in Delhi saw that there is no humility and in Bihar people started saying that the Prime Minister has no dignity
 in do chunaavon main maine usee janata ko unki bhashaa kii copy check karte dekha jo bina dekhe number diye ja rahi thi
 People began to find his decency in Hindi
 haalanki chunavi reliyon main unki hindi ab bhi waisi hi he jaisi loksabhaa chunaavon main thi
 The bus crowd should be good
 sarkari kaaryakramon main ve hindi bolte vakt khyaal rakhte hai ki pradhanmantri hai lekin bich bich main netaa kii tarah bol jate hai jaise mithai khaanaa band kar diya he ! sansad main unki hindi par phir kabhi alag se likhuungaa
 It is not that the Prime Minister does not speak Hindi while traveling abroad, but there speak two types of Hindi
 ek jab vah bhartiya mul ke samudaay ko sambodhit karte hai or doosraa jab vah kisi raashtra pramukh ke sarkari awaas yaa daftar se media ke sawaalon kaa jawaab hindi main dete hai
 At that time, his Hindi is not like that of Narendra Modi who roars in rallies but as soon as a stadium is found they forget the difference between Madison and Mokama
 satta kii hindi se azaad ho jate hai
 We know the English power but we talk less on the Indian power
 ab aata hum mistar prime ministar narendra modi par jo videshon main angrezi bolte hai
 The Prime Minister knows English, yet he reads the speech written in English
 mistar modi ne khud ko angreji bhashi netaa ke rup main sthapit karne ke liye technology kaa sahaara liya he
 There is a transparent plank in front of them, on which they speak by looking at it
 ek vaakya daayen mud kar bolte hai to agle vaakya ke liye baayen mud jate hai
 He is quite different from the Hindi-speaking Modi who speaks English
 mistar prime ministar narendra modi ke bheetar angrezi bolne kii athaah chaah he
 He is a multilingual leader
 gujarati, hindi or angrezi main taqariren karte hai
 These days, Ghalib and Sufi have also started working on the penance of saints! But when he speaks English, technology binds him
 aisa lagata he haath main nayaa nayaa yphone aayaa ho
 His body language shrinks while speaking English
 jaise kisi dhoti kurte vaale ko pehali baar tite prince suut pahana diya gaya ho
 There is no moving where you stand
 bade manch kii choti si jagah kaa istamaal karte hai or bhaashan ke zariye khud ko bada karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 He spoke in Hindi in the United Nations and in English in front of the American Congress
 mistar prime ministar narendra modi har samay hindi ke swabhimaan ko nahin dhonaa chaahate
 For them, Hindi is also an opportunity and English too
 vah hindi ke un roodhiwaadee pratikon ko nahin dhonaa chaahate ki videsh gaye to hindi bol kar aa gaye
 As soon as he entered the US Congress, he started shaking hands with mps
 ek pal main unke haav-bhav par angreziyat haaavee ho gai
 The language of becoming a 'cool' leader is or may be in Hindi, but the language and body language of Mr
 Modi adopts 'coolattva' (cool is the English word) of other languages
 mistar modi aseem mahatvakankshaon se bhare netaa hai
 Despite being extremely private, he shares the franchise of his ambitions among his supporters! vah bhale hi nehru virdohi hon lekin angrezi main bolte hue vah nehru ke bhaashanon kii oonchai ko chhu lenaa chaahate hai
 His jacket, which is called Modi Jacket, was called Nehru Jacket in the modern Indian politics
 modi chaahate hai ki desh or duniya unhen statsman ke rup main dekhe
 His speech delivered in Afghanistan and the US Congress may not have been written by him, but it was level by any scale
 us muqaam ko chhu lene vaala tha jo vah chaahate hai
 Mr
 Prime Minister Modi does not speak English like English
 angrezi bolte vakt vah un uccharanon ko hasil karne kii bechaini se mukt hai jinase aajkal har koi grasit he
 He does not alienate the listener from his English
 lekin thodaa sa laga ki vah angrezi main 'accomodate'( sweekrut) hona chaahate hai! swaabhaavik bhi he
 If it were in Hindi, this speech would have been discussed in every village, but it would not have any effect in America and the world
 amareeki congress main vah pradhanmantri yaa prime ministar se aage janaa chaahate the
 Gone too
 hindi bhashi gharon main angrezi se duraav nahin he lekin style vaali angrezi se lagata he ki ladkaa gaya kaam se
 No matter how useful he is
 mistar modi angreji ko hindi kii tarah bolte hai
 The government seems to have shrunk a little, but is careful and says its point
 bhale hi sahajata na ho lekin gambhirtha rahati he
 They are leaving their mark on English
 lagata he ki unki team main angrezi likhane vaale achche log hai
 There should also be people with a little understanding of history, who do not write the period of Konark temple wrong and replace their leader
 prime ministar modi ko un itihaaskaaron kii team bana leni chahie jinhen left kaha jaataa he !tippaniyan His speech at the US Congress reveals India's foreign policy as a policy of gratitude to the US in diplomatic terms, and also draws independent lines for India
 vah apni swaabhaavik swatantraaa ko bachaakar rakhane kii kala jaanate hai
 That's why he was speaking English but was unsure of how to pronounce a difficult accent like Massachusetts
 bas bolkar aage bad gaye
 Tried to give seriousness to every word and sentence
 amareeki congress main manmohan singh kaa bhaashan acha tha lekin mistar primaministar modi ne unki nafis angrezi ke bhaashan se zyaada apni theth angreziyat se apane bhaashan ko yaadgaar bana diya
 The English can also be native and typical
 thasak na ho to sunne waalon main kasak rah jaati he! The screws of indo-us relations will not be let loose by speeches
 america mulat: ek vyapaaree desh he
 India is trying to convert into a merchant country
 baat sanskaar or samskruti kii karegaa lekin uski vyapaarik nitiyaan aakraamak hoti ja rahi hai
 There will be talk of worshiping nature, but the ruthlessness of its exploitation will also be seen, if anyone wants to see
 bharat ab america kaa partner desh he
 America is the ambition of middle class citizens of India and is now turning into national ambition
 ham uskaa istemaal kar rahe hai yaa ve hamaara ye vidwaan baanchate rahenge
 My aim was only to underline the language and style of the Prime Minister
 bhashaa ke bahya rup ke aadhaar par unke vichaar pravaah ko samajha jaae
 Do you also find any difference between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi? vaajapeyi ke napathy main chale jane se rashtriya str par hindi kamazor pad gai thi
 PV Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh were scholars of many languages but both neither identified as Waqt nor recognized any one language
 is maamle main sonia gandhi kii hindi saraahneey rahi
 He had a desire in Hindi, people appreciated his efforts and gave him power twice
 vah likhakar padhati thi lekin bolne ke andaaz main vah apni party ke tamaam netaaon par baari pad jaati hai
 The feeling of creating a punch line in them is much better than leaders like Salman Khurshid, who speaks Hindi and Urdu
 vaise salmaan kurshid bolte hue behad saadhaaran or prabhaavaheen netaa lagate he
 i will write separately on the language of Congress leaders
 vaajapeyi ke baad hindi bolne vaale kai netaa kshetreey dalon main the lekin unki hindi kii bhi apni simaaen raheen hai
 However, many of them were leaders born of self-respect of Hindi or opposition to English
 abhi un par bhi vistaar se charchaa nahin karnaa chahta
 Just want to say that there was no urgency, naturalness, imagination and readiness in them
 ve apni bhashaa se kam apane saamaajik aadhaar ke dam par netaa rahe
 Linguists should study whether Arvind Kejriwal's Hindi aggression in the year 2011-2012 influenced Narendra Modi or that there was some kind of linguistic competition between the two that in the same way shouting, shouting and shouting Has to be filled
 kejariwal kii hindi, satta ko lalkaar rahi thi to modi kii hindi ne satta ke pratikon ko dhahaana shuru kar diya
 He resorted to Hindi to establish himself at the national level and assured the Hindi speakers that in this era of liberalization, when it is considered natural to speak English, he can still challenge with Hindi
 hindi bolne vaala angrezi par varchasv qaayam karne kii kuntha se bharaa rahata he jise kabhi swabhimaan to kabhi rashtrawaad ke rup main samajhataa he
 In 2014, the Prime Minister's Hindi frightened the linguistic elites of Lutyens' Delhi
 jo is dar ko sweekaar nahin karnaa chaahate the, ve modi ko bahari kehane lage jabaki yah baat puri tarah satya nahin he
 Modi had gone to Gujarat from Delhi but returned when he was outsider! His speech at election rallies began to be prolonged
 log der tak unki hindi ko notice karne lage
 The aristocracy of Hindi born out of liberalization started gaining confidence through their Hindi which was subdued by the British of UPA
 pradhanmantri banate hi sabko laga ki dilli ab hindi bolegi
 This is so to a large extent, but Delhi still speaks in English
 dilli kii satta puraani hoti he to angreji ho jaati he
 If it is new, it looks like Hindi
 dilli or bihar ke chunaav pradhanmantri kii hindi ke lihaaz se mahatvapurn hai
 In both places, his Hindi worked against him
 dilli main logon ne dekha ki vinamrata nahin he or bihar main log kehane lage ki pradhanmantri kii garima nahin he
 In these two elections, i saw the same people checking the copy of their language, who were being given numbers without seeing it
 log unki hindi main shaleenta khojane lage
 However, his Hindi in election rallies is still the same as it was in Lok Sabha elections
 bas bheed acchhee honi chahie
 While speaking Hindi in government programs, he takes care that he is the Prime Minister but in the middle he speaks like a leader as if sweets have stopped eating! i will again write separately on his Hindi in Parliament
 aisa nahin he ki videsh daure par pradhanmantri hindi nahin bolte lekin vahaan do prakaar kii hindi bolte hai
 One is when he addresses a community of Indian origin and the other when he answers media queries from the official residence or office of a nation's head in Hindi
 us vakt unki hindi us narendra modi ke jaisi nahin hoti jo reliyon main dahaadte hai lekin jaise hi koi stadium miltaa he ve medicin or mokama ke fark ko bhul jate hai
 They are free from the power of Hindi
 satta kii angreziyat to ham jaanate hai lekin satta kii hindiyat par kam baat karte hai 
 Now i come to Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi who speaks English abroad
 pradhanmantri ko angrezi aati he phir bhi vah angrezi main likhaa bhaashan padhate hai
 Mr
 Modi has used technology to establish himself as an English-speaking leader
 unke saamne ek paardarshee takhti lagi hoti he jis par likhaa dekhakar wo bolte hai
 If you speak a sentence with a right, then you turn to the left for the next sentence
 ve angrezi bolte hue hindi vaale modi se kaaphi alag ho jate hai
 Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a great desire to speak English
 ve bahubhashi netaa hai
 Gujarati, Hindi and English are contested
 in dinon gaalib or sufi santon ke qalaam par bhi mehnat karne lage hai! lekin jab vah angreji bolte hai to technology unhen baandh detii he
 Looks like a new iphone has arrived
 angreji bolte vakt unki dehbhasha sikud jaati he
 Like when a dhoti kurta is worn for the first time in a tight Prince suit
 jahaan khadey hote hai vahaan se hilte dulte nahin
 They use the small space of the big stage and try to enlarge themselves through speech
 vah sanyukt raashtra sangh main hindi main bole or amareeki congress ke saamne angrezi main
 Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not want to carry the pride of Hindi all the time
 unke liye hindi bhi ek avasar he or angrezi bhi
 He does not want to carry those orthodox symbols of Hindi that if he goes abroad, he comes by speaking Hindi
 amareeki congress main ghuste hi vah saansadon se haath milaane lage
 In an instant, the British dominated their attitude
 'kool' netaa banane kii dehbhasha hindi main bhi he yaa ho sakati he lekin mistar modi kii bhashaa or dehbhasha duusari bhashaaon ke 'kooltv' ( kool angrezi shabd he) ko apana leti he
 Mr
 Modi is a leader full of immense ambitions
 nitant nijee hone ke baad bhi vah apni mahatvakankshaon kii frenchizi apane samarthakon main baant dete hai! He may be anti-nehru but speaking in English, he wants to touch the height of Nehru's speeches
 unke jis jacket ko modi jacket kaha jaataa he vah aadhunik bhartiya raajnneeti ke aadikaal main nehru jacket hi kehalaata tha
 Modi wants the country and the world to see him as a Statesman
 afghanistan or amareeki congress main diya gaya unka bhaashan bhale hi unka na likhaa ho lekin kisi bhi paimaane se stareey tha
 He was going to touch the stage he wants
 mistar prime ministar modi angrezi ko angrezi kii tarah nahin bolte
 While speaking English, he is free from the discomfort of acquiring the accents that everyone nowadays suffers from
 vah apni angrezi se sunne vaale ko 'elionet' yani alag-thalag nahin karte hai
 But it felt a bit like he wanted to be 'accepted' in English! Is also natural
 vaise hindi main hota to is bhaashan kii gaanv gaanv main charchaa hoti lekin america or duniya main asar nahin hota
 In the US Congress, he wanted to go beyond the Prime Minister or Prime Minister
 chale bhi gaye
 In Hindi speaking houses there is no difference from English, but style English seems to indicate that the boy is gone
 bhale hi vah kitna hi kaam vaala ho 
 Mr
 Modi speaks English like Hindi
 thode sikude sikude se sarkaar nazar aate hai lekin sanbhal sanbhal kar apni baat kah jate hai
 Even if there is no naturalness, but there is seriousness
 ve angrezi par apni chhap chhod rahe hai
 His team seems to have good people writing English
 thodaa itihaas kii behatar samaj vaale log bhi hone chahie jo konark mandir ke kaal ko galat na likhe or apane netaa kii jagahansai na karaayen
 Prime Minister Modi should form a team of historians called Lefts! amareeki congress main unka bhaashan kootnithik lihaaz se bharat kii videsh niti ko america ke saamne aabhaar-niti ke rup main prakat karata he to bharat ke liye swatantra rekhaaen bhi khinchataa he
 He knows the art of preserving his natural freedom
 isliye angrezi bol rahe the lekin is baat se bephikr rahe ki mesachusets jaise mushkil uccharan ko kaise saadhaa jaae
 Just moved ahead by speaking
 har lafz or vaakya ko gambhirtha dene kaa prayaas kiya
 Manmohan Singh's speech at the US Congress was good, but Mr Prime Minister Modi made his speech memorable with his typical English speech more than his Nafees English speech
 angreziyat bhi desi or theth ho sakati he
 If you are not smitten, then the listeners remain tight! bharat-amareeki sambandhon ke pench bhaashanon se deele nahin honge
 America is basically a merchant country
 bharat prayasarat he ek vyapaaree desh main tabdeel hone ke liye
 It will talk about culture and culture, but its business policies are becoming aggressive
 prakruti kii puja kii baat hogi lekin uske dohan kii nishthurata bhi dikh jaaegi, agar koi dekhnaa chaahe to
 India is now a partner country of USA
 america bharat ke madhyamvargeey nagarikon kii mahatvakanksha he or ab rashtriya mahatvakanksha main badal rahaa he
 We are using it or they will continue to share this scholar of ours
 meraa maqasad sirf itnaa tha ki pradhanmantri kii bhashaa or style ko rekhaankit kiya jaae
 Their thought flow should be understood based on the external form of language
 kya aapako bhi pradhanmantri shri narendra modi or mistar prime ministar narendra modi main koi fark lagata he? After Vajpayee, many Hindi-speaking leaders were in regional parties, but they also have their limitations in Hindi
 haalanki unamem se kai hindi ke swabhimaan yaa angrezi ke virodh se paidaa hue netaa rahe
 Right now i do not want to discuss them in detail
 bas itnaa kahana chahta hoon ki unamem taatkalikta, swaabhaaviktaa, kalpanashiltaa or tatparta nahin thi
 He remained a leader on the basis of his social base less than his language
 bhashashastriyon ko is baat kaa adhyayan karnaa chahie ki kya 2011-2012 ke saal main arvind kejariwal kii hindi kii aakraamakata ne narendra modi ko prabhavit kiya yaa donon ke bich kisi kism kii bhashaai pratispardhaa hui ki ek hi tarah se chikh kar bolnaa, lalkaarna or hunkaar bharna he
 While Kejriwal's Hindi was defying power, Modi's Hindi started demolishing symbols of power
 unhone khud ko rashtriya str par sthapit karne ke liye hindi kaa sahaara liya or hindi bolne vaale ko bharosa diya ki udaarikaran ke is daur main jab angreji bolnaa swaabhaavik maan liya gaya he vah ab bhi hindi se chunauti de sakate hai
 The Hindi-speaking English is full of frustration to dominate the English, which sometimes considers self-respect and sometimes as nationalism
 saal 2014 main pradhanmantri kii hindi ne lutian dilli ke bhashaai kulinon ko daraa diya
 Those who did not want to accept this fear started calling Modi an outsider even though this is not completely true

 People started noticing his Hindi till late

 As soon as he became Prime Minister, everyone felt that Delhi would now speak Hindi

 It is not that the Prime Minister does not speak Hindi while traveling abroad, but there speak two types of Hindi

 satta kii hindi se azaad ho jate hai
 We know the English power but we talk less on the Indian power
 ab aata hum mistar prime ministar narendra modi par jo videshon main angrezi bolte hai
 The Prime Minister knows English, yet he reads the speech written in English
 mistar modi ne khud ko angreji bhashi netaa ke rup main sthapit karne ke liye technology kaa sahaara liya he
 There is a transparent plank in front of them, on which they speak by looking at it
 ek vaakya daayen mud kar bolte hai to agle vaakya ke liye baayen mud jate hai
 He is quite different from the Hindi-speaking Modi who speaks English
 mistar prime ministar narendra modi ke bheetar angrezi bolne kii athaah chaah he
 He is a multilingual leader
 gujarati, hindi or angrezi main taqariren karte hai
 These days, Ghalib and Sufi have also started working on the penance of saints! But when he speaks English, technology binds him
 aisa lagata he haath main nayaa nayaa yphone aayaa ho
 His body language shrinks while speaking English
 jaise kisi dhoti kurte vaale ko pehali baar tite prince suut pahana diya gaya ho
 There is no moving where you stand
 bade manch kii choti si jagah kaa istamaal karte hai or bhaashan ke zariye khud ko bada karne kaa prayaas karte hai

 mistar modi aseem mahatvakankshaon se bhare netaa hai
 Despite being extremely private, he shares the franchise of his ambitions among his supporters! vah bhale hi nehru virdohi hon lekin angrezi main bolte hue vah nehru ke bhaashanon kii oonchai ko chhu lenaa chaahate hai
 His jacket, which is called Modi Jacket, was called Nehru Jacket in the modern Indian politics
 modi chaahate hai ki desh or duniya unhen statsman ke rup main dekhe
 His speech delivered in Afghanistan and the US Congress may not have been written by him, but it was level by any scale
 us muqaam ko chhu lene vaala tha jo vah chaahate hai
 Mr
 Prime Minister Modi does not speak English like English
 angrezi bolte vakt vah un uccharanon ko hasil karne kii bechaini se mukt hai jinase aajkal har koi grasit he
 He does not alienate the listener from his English
 lekin thodaa sa laga ki vah angrezi main 'accomodate'( sweekrut) hona chaahate hai! swaabhaavik bhi he
 If it were in Hindi, this speech would have been discussed in every village, but it would not have any effect in America and the world
 amareeki congress main vah pradhanmantri yaa prime ministar se aage janaa chaahate the
 Gone too
 hindi bhashi gharon main angrezi se duraav nahin he lekin style vaali angrezi se lagata he ki ladkaa gaya kaam se
 No matter how useful he is
 mistar modi angreji ko hindi kii tarah bolte hai
 The government seems to have shrunk a little, but is careful and says its point
 bhale hi sahajata na ho lekin gambhirtha rahati he
 They are leaving their mark on English
 lagata he ki unki team main angrezi likhane vaale achche log hai
 There should also be people with a little understanding of history, who do not write the period of Konark temple wrong and replace their leader
 prime ministar modi ko un itihaaskaaron kii team bana leni chahie jinhen left kaha jaataa he !tippaniyan His speech at the US Congress reveals India's foreign policy as a policy of gratitude to the US in diplomatic terms, and also draws independent lines for India
 vah apni swaabhaavik swatantraaa ko bachaakar rakhane kii kala jaanate hai
 That's why he was speaking English but was unsure of how to pronounce a difficult accent like Massachusetts
 bas bolkar aage bad gaye
 Tried to give seriousness to every word and sentence
 amareeki congress main manmohan singh kaa bhaashan acha tha lekin mistar primaministar modi ne unki nafis angrezi ke bhaashan se zyaada apni theth angreziyat se apane bhaashan ko yaadgaar bana diya
 The English can also be native and typical
 thasak na ho to sunne waalon main kasak rah jaati he! The screws of indo-us relations will not be let loose by speeches
 america mulat: ek vyapaaree desh he
 India is trying to convert into a merchant country
 baat sanskaar or samskruti kii karegaa lekin uski vyapaarik nitiyaan aakraamak hoti ja rahi hai
 There will be talk of worshiping nature, but the ruthlessness of its exploitation will also be seen, if anyone wants to see
 bharat ab america kaa partner desh he
 America is the ambition of middle class citizens of India and is now turning into national ambition
 ham uskaa istemaal kar rahe hai yaa ve hamaara ye vidwaan baanchate rahenge
 My aim was only to underline the language and style of the Prime Minister
 bhashaa ke bahya rup ke aadhaar par unke vichaar pravaah ko samajha jaae
 Do you also find any difference between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi? dilli or bihar ke chunaav pradhanmantri kii hindi ke lihaaz se mahatvapurn hai
 In both places, his Hindi worked against him
 dilli main logon ne dekha ki vinamrata nahin he or bihar main log kehane lage ki pradhanmantri kii garima nahin he
 In these two elections, i saw the same people checking the copy of their language, who were being given numbers without seeing it
 log unki hindi main shaleenta khojane lage
 However, his Hindi in election rallies is still the same as it was in Lok Sabha elections
 bas bheed acchhee honi chahie
 While speaking Hindi in government programs, he takes care that he is the Prime Minister but in the middle he speaks like a leader as if sweets have stopped eating! i will again write separately on his Hindi in Parliament
 aisa nahin he ki videsh daure par pradhanmantri hindi nahin bolte lekin vahaan do prakaar kii hindi bolte hai
 One is when he addresses a community of Indian origin and the other when he answers media queries from the official residence or office of a nation's head in Hindi
 us vakt unki hindi us narendra modi ke jaisi nahin hoti jo reliyon main dahaadte hai lekin jaise hi koi stadium miltaa he ve medicin or mokama ke fark ko bhul jate hai
 They are free from the power of Hindi
 satta kii angreziyat to ham jaanate hai lekin satta kii hindiyat par kam baat karte hai 
 Now i come to Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi who speaks English abroad
 pradhanmantri ko angrezi aati he phir bhi vah angrezi main likhaa bhaashan padhate hai
 Mr
 Modi has used technology to establish himself as an English-speaking leader
 unke saamne ek paardarshee takhti lagi hoti he jis par likhaa dekhakar wo bolte hai
 If you speak a sentence with a right, then you turn to the left for the next sentence
 ve angrezi bolte hue hindi vaale modi se kaaphi alag ho jate hai
 Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a great desire to speak English
 ve bahubhashi netaa hai
 Gujarati, Hindi and English are contested
 in dinon gaalib or sufi santon ke qalaam par bhi mehnat karne lage hai! lekin jab vah angreji bolte hai to technology unhen baandh detii he
 Looks like a new iphone has arrived
 angreji bolte vakt unki dehbhasha sikud jaati he
 Like when a dhoti kurta is worn for the first time in a tight Prince suit
 jahaan khadey hote hai vahaan se hilte dulte nahin
 They use the small space of the big stage and try to enlarge themselves through speech
 vah sanyukt raashtra sangh main hindi main bole or amareeki congress ke saamne angrezi main
 Mr
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not want to carry the pride of Hindi all the time
 unke liye hindi bhi ek avasar he or angrezi bhi
 He does not want to carry those orthodox symbols of Hindi that if he goes abroad, he comes by speaking Hindi
 amareeki congress main ghuste hi vah saansadon se haath milaane lage
 In an instant, the British dominated their attitude
 'kool' netaa banane kii dehbhasha hindi main bhi he yaa ho sakati he lekin mistar modi kii bhashaa or dehbhasha duusari bhashaaon ke 'kooltv' ( kool angrezi shabd he) ko apana leti he
 Mr
 Modi is a leader full of immense ambitions
 nitant nijee hone ke baad bhi vah apni mahatvakankshaon kii frenchizi apane samarthakon main baant dete hai! He may be anti-nehru but speaking in English, he wants to touch the height of Nehru's speeches
 unke jis jacket ko modi jacket kaha jaataa he vah aadhunik bhartiya raajnneeti ke aadikaal main nehru jacket hi kehalaata tha
 Modi wants the country and the world to see him as a Statesman
 afghanistan or amareeki congress main diya gaya unka bhaashan bhale hi unka na likhaa ho lekin kisi bhi paimaane se stareey tha
 He was going to touch the stage he wants
 mistar prime ministar modi angrezi ko angrezi kii tarah nahin bolte
 While speaking English, he is free from the discomfort of acquiring the accents that everyone nowadays suffers from
 vah apni angrezi se sunne vaale ko 'elionet' yani alag-thalag nahin karte hai
 But it felt a bit like he wanted to be 'accepted' in English! Is also natural
 vaise hindi main hota to is bhaashan kii gaanv gaanv main charchaa hoti lekin america or duniya main asar nahin hota
 In the US Congress, he wanted to go beyond the Prime Minister or Prime Minister
 chale bhi gaye
 In Hindi speaking houses there is no difference from English, but style English seems to indicate that the boy is gone
 bhale hi vah kitna hi kaam vaala ho 
 Mr
 Modi speaks English like Hindi
 thode sikude sikude se sarkaar nazar aate hai lekin sanbhal sanbhal kar apni baat kah jate hai
 Even if there is no naturalness, but there is seriousness
 ve angrezi par apni chhap chhod rahe hai
 His team seems to have good people writing English
 thodaa itihaas kii behatar samaj vaale log bhi hone chahie jo konark mandir ke kaal ko galat na likhe or apane netaa kii jagahansai na karaayen
 Prime Minister Modi should form a team of historians called Lefts! amareeki congress main unka bhaashan kootnithik lihaaz se bharat kii videsh niti ko america ke saamne aabhaar-niti ke rup main prakat karata he to bharat ke liye swatantra rekhaaen bhi khinchataa he
 He knows the art of preserving his natural freedom
 isliye angrezi bol rahe the lekin is baat se bephikr rahe ki mesachusets jaise mushkil uccharan ko kaise saadhaa jaae
 Just moved ahead by speaking
 har lafz or vaakya ko gambhirtha dene kaa prayaas kiya
 Manmohan Singh's speech at the US Congress was good, but Mr Prime Minister Modi made his speech memorable with his typical English speech more than his Nafees English speech
 angreziyat bhi desi or theth ho sakati he
 If you are not smitten, then the listeners remain tight! bharat-amareeki sambandhon ke pench bhaashanon se deele nahin honge
 America is basically a merchant country
 bharat prayasarat he ek vyapaaree desh main tabdeel hone ke liye
 It will talk about culture and culture, but its business policies are becoming aggressive
 prakruti kii puja kii baat hogi lekin uske dohan kii nishthurata bhi dikh jaaegi, agar koi dekhnaa chaahe to
 India is now a partner country of USA
 america bharat ke madhyamvargeey nagarikon kii mahatvakanksha he or ab rashtriya mahatvakanksha main badal rahaa he
 We are using it or they will continue to share this scholar of ours
 meraa maqasad sirf itnaa tha ki pradhanmantri kii bhashaa or style ko rekhaankit kiya jaae
 Their thought flow should be understood based on the external form of language
 kya aapako bhi pradhanmantri shri narendra modi or mistar prime ministar narendra modi main koi fark lagata he? It is not that the Prime Minister does not speak Hindi while traveling abroad, but there speak two types of Hindi
 ek jab vah bhartiya mul ke samudaay ko sambodhit karte hai or doosraa jab vah kisi raashtra pramukh ke sarkari awaas yaa daftar se media ke sawaalon kaa jawaab hindi main dete hai
 At that time, his Hindi is not like that of Narendra Modi who roars in rallies but as soon as a stadium is found they forget the difference between Madison and Mokama
 satta kii hindi se azaad ho jate hai
 We know the English power but we talk less on the Indian power
 ab aata hum mistar prime ministar narendra modi par jo videshon main angrezi bolte hai
 The Prime Minister knows English, yet he reads the speech written in English
 mistar modi ne khud ko angreji bhashi netaa ke rup main sthapit karne ke liye technology kaa sahaara liya he
 There is a transparent plank in front of them, on which they speak by looking at it
 ek vaakya daayen mud kar bolte hai to agle vaakya ke liye baayen mud jate hai
 He is quite different from the Hindi-speaking Modi who speaks English
 mistar prime ministar narendra modi ke bheetar angrezi bolne kii athaah chaah he
 He is a multilingual leader
 gujarati, hindi or angrezi main taqariren karte hai
 These days, Ghalib and Sufi have also started working on the penance of saints! But when he speaks English, technology binds him
 aisa lagata he haath main nayaa nayaa yphone aayaa ho
 His body language shrinks while speaking English
 jaise kisi dhoti kurte vaale ko pehali baar tite prince suut pahana diya gaya ho
 There is no moving where you stand
 bade manch kii choti si jagah kaa istamaal karte hai or bhaashan ke zariye khud ko bada karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 He spoke in Hindi in the United Nations and in English in front of the American Congress
 mistar prime ministar narendra modi har samay hindi ke swabhimaan ko nahin dhonaa chaahate
 For them, Hindi is also an opportunity and English too
 vah hindi ke un roodhiwaadee pratikon ko nahin dhonaa chaahate ki videsh gaye to hindi bol kar aa gaye
 As soon as he entered the US Congress, he started shaking hands with mps
 ek pal main unke haav-bhav par angreziyat haaavee ho gai
 The language of becoming a 'cool' leader is or may be in Hindi, but the language and body language of Mr
 Modi adopts 'coolattva' (cool is the English word) of other languages
 mistar modi aseem mahatvakankshaon se bhare netaa hai
 Despite being extremely private, he shares the franchise of his ambitions among his supporters! vah bhale hi nehru virdohi hon lekin angrezi main bolte hue vah nehru ke bhaashanon kii oonchai ko chhu lenaa chaahate hai
 His jacket, which is called Modi Jacket, was called Nehru Jacket in the modern Indian politics
 modi chaahate hai ki desh or duniya unhen statsman ke rup main dekhe
 His speech delivered in Afghanistan and the US Congress may not have been written by him, but it was level by any scale
 us muqaam ko chhu lene vaala tha jo vah chaahate hai
 Mr
 Prime Minister Modi does not speak English like English
 angrezi bolte vakt vah un uccharanon ko hasil karne kii bechaini se mukt hai jinase aajkal har koi grasit he
 He does not alienate the listener from his English
 lekin thodaa sa laga ki vah angrezi main 'accomodate'( sweekrut) hona chaahate hai! swaabhaavik bhi he
 If it were in Hindi, this speech would have been discussed in every village, but it would not have any effect in America and the world
 amareeki congress main vah pradhanmantri yaa prime ministar se aage janaa chaahate the
 Gone too
 hindi bhashi gharon main angrezi se duraav nahin he lekin style vaali angrezi se lagata he ki ladkaa gaya kaam se
 No matter how useful he is
 mistar modi angreji ko hindi kii tarah bolte hai
 The government seems to have shrunk a little, but is careful and says its point
 bhale hi sahajata na ho lekin gambhirtha rahati he
 They are leaving their mark on English
 lagata he ki unki team main angrezi likhane vaale achche log hai
 There should also be people with a little understanding of history, who do not write the period of Konark temple wrong and replace their leader
 prime ministar modi ko un itihaaskaaron kii team bana leni chahie jinhen left kaha jaataa he !tippaniyan His speech at the US Congress reveals India's foreign policy as a policy of gratitude to the US in diplomatic terms, and also draws independent lines for India
 vah apni swaabhaavik swatantraaa ko bachaakar rakhane kii kala jaanate hai
 That's why he was speaking English but was unsure of how to pronounce a difficult accent like Massachusetts
 bas bolkar aage bad gaye
 Tried to give seriousness to every word and sentence
 amareeki congress main manmohan singh kaa bhaashan acha tha lekin mistar primaministar modi ne unki nafis angrezi ke bhaashan se zyaada apni theth angreziyat se apane bhaashan ko yaadgaar bana diya
 The English can also be native and typical
 thasak na ho to sunne waalon main kasak rah jaati he! The screws of indo-us relations will not be let loose by speeches
 america mulat: ek vyapaaree desh he
 India is trying to convert into a merchant country
 baat sanskaar or samskruti kii karegaa lekin uski vyapaarik nitiyaan aakraamak hoti ja rahi hai
 There will be talk of worshiping nature, but the ruthlessness of its exploitation will also be seen, if anyone wants to see
 bharat ab america kaa partner desh he
 America is the ambition of middle class citizens of India and is now turning into national ambition
 ham uskaa istemaal kar rahe hai yaa ve hamaara ye vidwaan baanchate rahenge
 My aim was only to underline the language and style of the Prime Minister
 bhashaa ke bahya rup ke aadhaar par unke vichaar pravaah ko samajha jaae
