 On January 16, the special judge of CBI in Rohini court of Delhi convicted all these people
 jabaki somvaar ko doshiyon kii ore se sajaa par bahes puri ho gai
 What is the whole matter? In the year 1999-2000, 3206 JBT teachers were recruited in 18 districts of Haryana
 aarope he ki tay maanakon ko taak par rakhkar tab manachaahe logon kii bhartee kii gai
 The government handed over the responsibility of recruitment from the Staff Selection Commission to the committees constituted at the district level, these committees prepared the selection list based on fake interviews

 isamen kaha gaya he ki bharat ke saath 1971 kii jang ke baad yah abhiyaan pakistan ke liye ab tak kii 'badi sharmindagi’ he
 According to him, the US carried out "a malicious military campaign inside Pakistan" about which Islamabad was not informed and the Pakistani security establishment had no idea whether bin Laden was in Abbottabad or in Pakistan It is hidden somewhere

 It is not blamed on any one person
 doshiyon ke naam bhi isamen shaamil nahin hai
 After talking to more than two hundred people, including bin Laden's family and isi's senior intelligence officer, the commission concludes that the incident in May 2011 alone is neither the ISI nor the military nor the government's 'failure' 
 isaki bajaae yah puure samaaj or khaskar abhijatya varg kii ore sanket karata he jo niskriy he or jiske bheetar ativaadee jihadiyon kii paith bhi he
 The failure to detect bin Laden has been blamed directly on the ISI, which has only been said to show the extent of his "incompetence, which is surprising if not incredible", while showing the maximum extent of the blame For this, there has been talk of "close collusion" of those levels of his command, which the commission has not been able to identify
 abtabad main america intelligence abhiyaan kaa pataa lagane kii naakaami yaa phir chapa abhiyaan puraa ho jane tak uski pratikriya dene main naakaami kaa dosha suraksha pratishthan kii naukarshahi par madha gaya he, jiske bare main kamishan kahata he ki usamen bade paimaane par silsilewar punargathan kii darkaar he
 In short, this report itself is disastrous, which is why even after six months of its completion, Pakistan has not been officially released yet

 He was accompanied by his three wives, eight children and five grandchildren

 His family had been hiding in Karachi since 9 / 11 and went to Swat Valley from there
 vahaan bin laden kii kam se kam ek baar 9 / 11 ke mastermind khalid shaikh mohammad (keesam) se mulaakaat hui thi
 The KSM was captured by the CIA on 1 March 2001 in a military area from Rawalpindi, barely a mile from the army's headquarters
 siie ne jab chapa maaraa, to unhone iesai ko nahin bataaya tha ki ve keesam ko khoj rahe hai
 Due to this arrest, Laden had to go to Haripur for two years

 Gradually other members of his family also met him
 vah apane nae thikaane main agast, 2005 main pahunchaa
 Abbottabad is 30 miles to the north of the Government Communications Headquarters of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, the country's capital, and is on the famous Karakoram Highway
 vahiin pakistan kii kakul military academy bhi he, jo bin laden ke thikaane se ek mile se bhi kam duuri par thi
 Abbottabad is named after the British military officer and colonial administrator James Abbott, who founded the city in 1853 as a cantonment of the British Army
 abt ne 19veen sadi ke madhya main sikhon ke khilaaf british east india company kii ore se jang ladi or use apane is shahar par bahut naaj tha
 The CIA pursued its Pakistani messenger Abu Ahmed al-kuwaiti to locate bin Laden
 kuwaiti 9 / 11 ke hamale kii yojana banane main laden kaa sahyogi rahaa tha or bahari duniya main uskaa sandesh le jane or laane kaa kaam karata tha
 Al Kuwaiti was a Pakistani Pakhtun tribal
 uskaa paalan-poshan kuwait main hua
 He spoke Arabic and Pashto fluently
 2010 main america guptcharon ko pataa chalaa ki vah abtabad ke ek teen manjila makaan main he, jo shahar ke duusare makaanon se alag dikhataa tha
 The house was surrounded by an 18-foot-high wall with a wire fence, where there was no phone or internet signal and it was thought to have been built to hide someone
 baahar se is parisar ke bheetar deevaaron or screen ke kaaran dekh paanaa mumkin nahin tha
 The Pakistani commission has described this house as a 'strange design'
 mileebhagat kaa koi sakshya nahipakistani kamishan ne 2003 se is makaan ke nirmaan ke har pahalu ko kareeb se jaancha he
 It concludes that there was "a whole series of illegal and irregular transactions on the basis of fake papers and identity", which should have been looked into by the local administration and the ISI
 kamishan achraj jaahir karata he jo sahi bhi he ki ''lagaataar chah saal tak saare aas-pados, sthaneey afasaron, police, suraksha or guptchar adhikariyon kii najar se iske aakaar, ajeeb akruti, taar kii baad, kaaron yaa kisi aane-jane vaale ke na hone ityadi” kaa batch janaa ek aisi aakshamata he jis par 'vishwaas nahin hota
 The report does not deny the collusion of some elements of the ISI but the commission admits that it did not find any concrete evidence
 kamishan kahata he ki al kaayda ne apane sargana ko chah saal tak chupaane ke liye acchhee ranneeti apanaai thi
 But bin Laden could not remain hidden only because of Al Kuwaiti and his brother
 iske liye or bade network kii jarurat hoti
 The seal team found such phone numbers in the house, which suggests that Al Kuwaiti was in contact with a terrorist organization
 june, 2011 kii neuyork times kii ek report main us sanghathan kaa naam harakat ul mujahidin bataaya gaya
 Bin Laden was associated with him since the late nineties
 aathven dashak main iesai ne use bharat se ladgaye ke liye banaaya tha or yah dashakon se uske liye vafadari ke saath kaam karata rahaa he
 Its leader Fazularrahman Khalil lives openly on the outskirts of Islamabad
 yah report times kii report jaisaa vishisht udghaatan to nahin karti, lekin nishkarsh ke taur par kahati he ki al kuwaiti or uskaa giroh pakistani jihadi samudaay ke ek ''saajagaar maahaul main pabast tha” jo uski gatividhiyon ko aasaan banaata tha or laden ke thikaane ko chhupaae rakhane main madad karata tha
 The commission recommends that the Government of Pakistan investigate with full concern whether ISI people were in that 'atmosphere'
 is sawaal kaa koi jawaab nahireport main maahaul par sahi jor diya gaya he
 In Pakistan, al Qaeda does not operate in any air, rather it gets a friendly atmosphere
 bin laden ke sahyogiyon main lashkar-e-taiyaba kaa sargana hafiz said or afgani talibani netaa mullah umr the
 Both are also partners of ISI
 report sahi nishkarsh detii he ki darasal is samasya kii jad is desh ke itihaas main chuphi he
 According to him, "the dark phase of General zia-ul-haq has left Pakistan with an extremist legacy of criminal, violent, ideological and anti-national structure"
 ”bill clinton ke baad se ab tak ke sabhi america raashtrapati pakistan ko chetate rahe hai ki aatank ko panaah dene yaa paalane kaa nateeja aaj nahin to kal vinaashkari hi hoga
 Now the destruction has been done, but the monster which was born by General Jia is swallowing someone in Pakistan every day
 kamishan kahata he ki chauthe dashak main apane janm ke baad se america-pakistan kaa rishta ''utaar-chadhaav vaala” rahaa he lekin 2011 main vah apane nimnatam str par pahunch gaya
 The report says that the Obama administration did not trust the ISI and its military leadership from the beginning
 kamishan is lekhak ke pakistan par kiye lekhan se ek para uddhrut karata he or yahaan ke generalon par obama ko bharosa na hone ke saboot ke taur par mere uddhran ko doharaata he ki pakistan ''duniya kaa sabase khatarnaak mulk he
 "although the relationship between the two countries has improved somewhat since 2011, it is only a superficial matter
" kamishan kii report hamen aagaah karti he ki hamaare paas ab bhi abtabad ke sabase bade rahasy kaa jawaab nahin hai ki itihaas kaa most wanted shaks aakhir kaise pakistani fouj ke angan main chah saal tak lagaataar bina kisi bhanak ke chupa rahaa? report buniyadi dosha iesai kii ''baari aakshamata” par daalati he lekin mileebhagat se inkaar nahin karti

 Our chemistry on the screen is very good and we complement each other
 isse ye saaf he ki ek jodi ke taur par logon ne hamen kaaphi pyaar diya he, jabaki hamane saath main sirf teen hi filmein kii hai
 Bhoomi also said that along with collaborating in three films one after the other, both of them have also grown a lot as actors
 bhoomi ne aage bataaya- dam laga ke haisha, shubh mangal saavdhaan se bala tak hamane aisi filmon main saath kaam kiya he, jo samaaj ke muddon par bani hai
 i think our pair has sincerely displayed the problems of the society
 bala main kaisaa he bhoomi kaa role?film bala main bhoomi dark color kii mahila ke role main najar ai hai
 While Ayushmann appeared in the role of a bald person in the film

 gurugram ke baar main mahila ke saath chhedhchhadpulice ne maamla darj jaanch shuru kigurugram ke ek baar main chhedhkhani kaa virodh karne par marpet kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 This entire case was captured in the CCTV installed there
 sisitivi footage or peedit kii shikaayat par gurugram kii sadar bazaar thana police ne cese darj kar jaanch shuru kar di he
 The incident took place on the night of November 10 and 11 at around half past twelve
 ghatana sthal ko special chambar ke naam se janaa jaataa he or ise vahaan ke log ahaata bhi kehete hai
 The victim says that he went with his family at around 10 pm on November 10, along with the victim's 10-year-old son
 peedit kaa betaa divyang he
 According to the victim, when the people were sitting there, only about 5 to 6 boys came to the seat next to them and started talking in abusive language with the victim's wife
 peedit ke mutabik iske baad jab ye log vahaan se jane ke liye uthe to ek ladkaa unki patni ke paas aayaa or galat tareeke se choote hue chalaa gaya
 After this, when he protested, someone came from behind and bottled his head
 us vakt unki god me unka betaa tha jo gir gaya, par ganimat rahi ki use chot nahin ai
 After this there was a lot of fighting
 bottle lagane kii vajah se peedit ke sir main gambhir chot ai or unke sir main 5 taanke aae
 The woman says that they did not pay attention to them for a long time, but when the limit was reached, they protested
 police kaa kahana he ki unhen jo pehali shikaayat mili thi usamen chhedchhad kii baat nahin thi
 This is the reason that a section of assault and use of indecent language was imposed in the case, but later on 13 November, the victim woman reached the police station and gave a complaint of molestation, after which the police added the section of molestation in the case
 police kaa kahana he ki wo puure maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he

 (niraj vashishtha ke input ke saath) The Vasco Di Gama Express has crashed at Manikpur near Chitrakoot in Uttar Pradesh
 train ke 13 dibbe patari se utar gaye hai
 According to Chitrakoot DM Shivakant, 3 people died in the accident
 kaha ja rahaa he ki rail main puraani takanic se bane ICF coach the isi vajah se dibbe ek ke upar ek chadh gaye
 If the coaches were made from the German technology LHB, the scale of the accident could have been reduced
 railgadee hamaare jivan kaa ek ahm hissaa he, lekin train ke bare main kai aisi baaten hai jo aam aadmi ko jarur janani chahie
 Actually you must have seen that there are two types of train coaches, first one is the blue coach in which you and we usually travel, but you must have seen one coach who is silver and red
 kya aap jaanate he ki in donon main kya antar he or donon kaa kya upyog he
 The coaches in the train that are blue are called ICF (integral Coach Factory) coaches
 or jo silver or laal rang ke hote hai unhentheabh (linke Hofmann Busch)coach kaha jaataa he
 
 
 
 jaane ICF or LHB coach main kya antar harrichh (integral Coach Factory): intigral coach factory tamilnadu ke chennai main sthit he
 It was founded in 1952
 ye factory indian railway ke adheen kaam karti he
 Integral Coach Factory manufactures all types of Integral Coaches including General, AC, Sleeper, DEMU and MEMU coaches
 vasco di gamma express durghatnagrast, 3 kii maut, 10 ghayal, nahin shuru hua raahat kaaryandaubh (linke Hofmann Busch):link hoffmen bush (alechabi) coach ko banane kii factory kapoorthala main he
 These coaches have been brought from Germany in India
 LHB coach kaa prayogyeabh coach kaa prayog tej gati vaali trainon main kiya jaataa hai desh kii sabase tej train gatiman express, shatabdi express or rajdhani express main inhen coach kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Let me tell you, the LHB coach has been designed for fast speed train only
 inamen kshamta hoti he ki ye 160 se 180 kimi prati ghante kii speed main daud sake
 All kinds of LHB coaches are made in the LHB Coach Factory, which includes AC, Non AC, Sleeper Coach
 in coach main railway yatriyon kii yatra kaaphi surakshit hoti he or inamen durghatana hone kii ashanka kam rahati he
 LHB coaches are much better than ICF coaches
 bataa den, donon tarah ke coach main bahut antar he
 Know about these Indian women who have achieved success, know some special information about LHB and ICF coach, why LHB coach in train is important
 
 
 - LHB coach kii everej speed 160 se 200 kimi hoti he jabaki ICF coach kii speed 70 se 140 kimi prati ghanta tak hoti he
 At this speed both these coaches run safely
 - LHB coach main (anti-telescopic) anti telescopy system hota he jiske kaaran iske dibbe aasaani se patari se nahin utar pate
 On the other hand, its bins are made of stallness steel and aluminum, while ICF coaches are made of mild steel, which do not bear the brunt and cause accidents
 - LHB coach main discs brake system hota he jisase train ko jaldi roka ja saktaa he jabaki ICF coach main airbrake or thread brake system hota he jisase chalati train ko rokane main thodaa zyaada samay lagata hai
 - Wheel base of LHB coach is smaller than that of ICF coach which keeps the rail safe even at high speed, this reduces the chance of accidents
 - LHB coach main agar aap baithenge to train ke chalane kii aawaaj aapako zyada pareshaan nahin karegi kyonki iskaa sound level 60 desibal kaa hota he jabaki ICF coach kaa sound label 100 desibal hota he
 Such a person who has spent his whole life in human service - the LHB coach controls with a microprocessor
 isamen air condishning system hota he jo coach ke taapmaana ko niyantrit karata he
 Which keeps the train safe
 - LHB coach main do dibbe alag tarah se kapaling kii jaati he ki durghatana hone par dibbe ek ke upar ek na chadhen
 Usually, in an accident, the coaches of ICF coaches climb on top of each other and there is much loss of life and property

 a post shared by disha patani (paatni) (@dishapatani) on Mar 8, 2018 at 8:44 am PST aapane kabhi sochaa he ki dinabhar kii jaddojahad ke bich aap kitni baar saans lete hai? agar minutebhar main 12 baar saans bhi lee jaae to insaan satraa hazaar se zyaada saansen lete hue har din apane vajood ko banaae rakhata he
 But during this time there is hardly any idea that there will be a day when life will stop
 insaani soch zindagi kii is sachai se hameshaa vaakif rahi he
 Everyone knows that one day they will not be there
 or jane-anjaane ham sab kuch aisa zarur karnaa chaahate hai jisase hamaare baad bhi hamaari maujuudagi kisi naa kisi main zindaa rahe
 Either in memories or in some of the things that we have done for others
 aisa hi taar chhedati he pakistan kii 23 saal kii gita kii kahani
 Sorry, actually Gita of India
 14 saal pehle galati se sarhad paar karne vaali ye bacchee ab badi ho gai he
 She cannot speak and hear
 lekin apni maa se milane or bharat aane kii chahat ne uski kahani ko behad filmi or dil chune vaala bana diya
 Her story also corresponds to the recently released film Bajrangi Bhaijaan
 aise main enditivi par barkhaa dutt ke live broadcast ke zarie uski mulaakaat hoti he salmaan khan se
 With Salman's very secular and delightful style, Geeta's story starts to look even better
 lekin is kaarykram main jab salmaan ne ye kaha ki gita kii maa kaa jab koi ata-pataa nahin he to unke liye pakistan main rahanaa hi behatar he to gita ke aansu nahin thame
 She just weeps, weeps
 gita kaa mood thik karne ke liye salmaan use hansaane kii kaafii koshish bhi karte hai or akhirkaar wo muskura detii he
 The truth is perhaps that the Pakistani citizens who raise Geeta are her true parents
 aaj ye baat kai lihaaz se myne bhi nahin rakhti ki gita kaa desh koun sa he
 But for 14 years he has a dream to meet his mother
 gita apane asal parivaar se mil paae yaa nahin, uski zindagi kaa ek maqasad he jo use jeene main nai urja detaa he
 Salman Khan may be criminal in the eyes of law, laughing and crying to Geeta even if he is on this side of the border and he is on that side
 donon ke liye ye pal khaas he
 The comments ye kahani hamen itnaa zarur bataati he ki zindagi besh keemati he
 The Gita, which cannot speak and hear, got life as well as its purpose
 salmaan jinke paas sabakuch he, log unase naaraaz bhi hai or jaan bhi chhidakte hai
 Both have got sorrow, love has also got both
 donon ke paas ek zindagi he jeene ko
 In their own way, completely different from each other, same
 lekin is dauraan ye khyaal shaayad hi aata ho ki ek din aisa bhi hoga jab zindagi tham jaaegi
 Human thinking has always been aware of this fact of life
 sab jaanate hai ki ek din wo nahin honge
 And knowingly or unknowingly, we want to do everything in such a way that even after us our presence remains alive in some or the other
 yaa to yaadon main yaa kuch aise kaamon main jo ham dusron ke liye kar gaye
 The story of 23-year-old Geeta of Pakistan connects the same wire
 maaf kiijie asal main hindustan kii gita
 This girl, who crossed the border by mistake 14 years ago, has now grown up
 wo bol or sun nahin sakati
 But his desire to meet his mother and come to India made his story extremely filmy and heart touching
 uski kahani haal hi main release hui film bajrangi bhaijan se mail bhi khaati he
 In such a situation, he meets Salman Khan through live broadcast of Barkha Dutt on NDTV
 salmaan ke behad secular or khushmizaaj andaaz ke saath gita kii kahani or bhi zyaada acchhee lagane lagati he
 But in this program, when Salman said that it is better for him to stay in Pakistan when Geeta's mother has no idea, then Geeta's tears did not stop
 wo bas roti jaati he, roti jaati he
 To correct the mood of Geeta, Salman also tries hard to make her laugh and finally she smiles
 sach shaayad yahi he ki gita ko paalane vaale pakistani naagarik uske sachche maa-baap hai
 Today, in many respects it does not even matter which country the Gita is
 lekin 14 saal se uski ankhon main apni maa se milane kaa sapana zarur he
 Whether Geeta is able to meet her real family or not, there is a purpose in her life which gives her new energy to live
 salmaan khan bhale hi kaanoon kii nazar main criminal hon, gita ko rote-rote hansaa dete hai bhale hi wo sarhad ke is taraf hon or wo us taraf
 This moment is special for both
 tippaniyan This story tells us so much that life is precious
 gita jo bol or sun nahin sakati, use jivan bhi mila or uskaa ek maqasad bhi
 Salman who has everything, people are angry with him and also throw life
 dukh donon ko mila he, pyaar bhi donon ko mila he
 They both have a life to live
 apane-apane andaaz main ek-duusare se bilkul alag bhi, ek jaisi bhi

 Mirzapur DM Anurag Patel says how did print media journalist Pawan Jaiswal make a video of the mid-day meal with salt bread? This shows that he conspired
 use sirf still photo khinchni chahie thi
 He said that you are a journalist of print media, you would have taken a photo which you felt was serious that if something was going wrong you could print it
 lekin unhone aisa nahin kiya
 Therefore, his role seemed dubious and he figured in 120 (B)
 unke khilaaf bhi mukadmaa darj kiya gaya
 DM asked the journalists that you yourself had given the bite that salt bread was distributed in the mid-day meal (mirzapur Midday Meal) there, so they said that salt falls in the khichdi
 patrakaron ne jab poocha ki aapaki pehle kii ek bite he, jisamen aapane hi bolaa tha ki namak chaaval hi vahaan banataa tha
 On this, DM Anurag Patel said that khichdi contains salt rice
 dm kah rahe hai ki pradhan ke pratinidhi ne patrkaar se kaha ki main sajeesh karke mid de mil kii video viral kar rahaa hum
 You support me and the journalist joined it
 dm ne kaha ki video main suna duungaa
 a man is calling that you come and i am plotting that the video is being made and the video has to go viral
 aap isamen aa jaaiye or shaamil ho jaaiye or meraa sahyog kariye
 When the video is made, make it viral
 bataa den ki purvi uttar pradesh main mirzapur jile ke ek sarkari skool main shoot kiye gaye video main bacchon ko centre sarkaar kii mahatvakankshi yojana ke antargat mid-de mile ke taur par skool ke coridor main baithkar namak ke saath roti khate dekha ja saktaa he
 The video was shot on August 22 by journalist Pawan Jaiswal, who worked with the local Hindi daily newspaper 'jansandesh Times'

 Now the process of preparing the detailed project report of both cities is going on
 metro kii magenta line ke uddhatan ko lekar bijepi or kejariwal ke bich to jubaani jang chal hi rahi thi
 The Samajwadi Party also jumped in the race to take credit as soon as the metro started

 As soon as the entry in the Metro was open red hat of Samajwadi Party, hundreds of SP workers entered the metro
 haalanki ye saare log metro main tikat lekar chadhe, lekin stesan or metro train ke bheetar narebaaji kii or noida main metro kii is nai line ko laane kaa shrenkhilesh yadavako die jane kii maang kii
 Here BJP has said that the program took place in UP and Metro also ran from UP, so what work did Kejriwal do in UP
 rahi baat shrey lene kii to metro ko dilli main laane kaa shrey atal bihari vaajapeyi or tab ke mukhyamantrimdanlaal khuranako jaataa he or unhen ye shrey pehle se hi mila hua he
 In the afternoon, PM Modi inaugurated the metro and in the evening the metro from Botanical Garden to Kalkaji was opened to the common people
 pehali train main aam musafiron ke saath hamaare samvaadadaata kapil sharma ne bhi safar kiya or unase tamaam muddon par baat kii
 Also asked the passengers what they would benefit from the new line and whether they would be afraid to travel in a driverless train
 pichley 15 saal main 27 baar metro kii nai line shuru hui he
 The entire metro line is also in place to prevent increasing accidents and suicide incidents in the Delhi Metro
 nai magenta line ke har stesan par platform or trek ke bich ek diwaar lagaai gai he, jisamen daravaaje lage honge
 These doors are platform screen doors, which will open only after the trane stops on the platform

 Opposition to the candidature of BJP leader and sitting MP Satish Gautam from Aligarh has started
 satish gautam kii daavedaari kaa upi bijepi ke kaddavar netaa kalyaan singh ne virodh kiya he
 At present, Rajasthan Governor Kalyan Singh is right in his voice but has said that the party has given ticket to such a person who has never visited Atrauli
 naa hi unhone koi kaam karaayaa he, ise lekar puure jile main kaaphi asantosh he
 Kalyan Singh has asked BJP workers opposing Satish Gautam to wait
 bataa den ki satish gautam aligarh ke gonda ilaake ke rahane vaale hai
 Satish Gautam has done politics in Noida
 bijepi main kai padon par rahane ke baad 2014 main party ne unhen aligarh se candidet ne banaaya tha
 In 2014, Satish Gautam won the Modi wave by more than 2 lakh votes
 mana jaataa he ki satish gautam ko kalyaan singh kaa samarthan hasil tha
 But things have changed in the last 5 years
 donon netaaon ke bich paidaa hui duuri ke baad andaja lagaaya ja rahaa tha ki satish gautam kaa patta is baar cat saktaa he, lekin sanghathan se najdiki kaayam rakh satish gautam ek baar phir se saansadi kaa tikat lene main kaamyaab rahe
 Some leader-activists who raised their voice against Satish Gautam's candidature reached Kalyan Singh's house
 kaaryakartaaon kii aawaaj sun kalyaan singh ghar se baahar nikle or kaaryakartaaon ko pehle holi kii shubhakamanaayen di or kaha ki unhone unki bhaawanaaon ko samaj liya he
 Kalyan Singh said, "the only thing i can say to you is that opinion should have been asked from the workers too, now that i have made a candidate, what can i and you do in that?" aisa he ki atarauli main kabhi satish gautam gaye hi nahin, naa unhone koi kaam karaayaa he
 Therefore, there is a lot of dissatisfaction with this ticket in the entire district
 main ek sanvaidhanik pad par hum or isse zyada raajnneetik tippanee nahin kar saktaa
 Whatever will be seen, wait, i have understood your feelings from heart, mind, soul, what to do, will be seen
 "kyon myne rakhata he kalyaan singh kaa virodhbata den ki kalyaan singh bijepi ke bade netaa rahe hai
 Kalyan Singh belongs to the Lodh community
 upi main is samudaay kii aabaadi 5 se 6 pratishat he
 The Lodh community is considered a strong supporter of the BJP and a traditional vote bank

 Declaration on 26 / 11 anniversary, wrong army has said that Pakistani guns and cannons in Kashmir valley are demanding jihad and in the midst of all this it has been decided to organize cricket matches between Hindustan and Pakistan
 sampadakeey main kaha gaya he ki pakistaniyon ke is nrushans hamale main shahid hue nirdosh nagarikon or police waalon kaa jab samaran kiya ja rahaa tha thik usee samay 26 / 11 kaa muhoort sadhakar bharat or pakistan ke bich cricket khilne ke liye disambar kii taarikh ghoshit karne kaa nirlajj krity kiya jaae, isse bada durbhaagya kya ho saktaa he?shivasena jari rakhegi virohsampadakeey main aage likhaa gaya he ki pakistan ke saath cricket khilne kaa bharat main virodh ho rahaa he
 Sivasenikos have revolted against Pakistanis throughout Maharashtra, including Mumbai
 isliye ab ye match bharat ke bajaay srilanka main khele jaayenge
 The editorial further states that the Indian cricket board is intent on marrying the Pakistani cricket board, whether fried in ghee or mixed with sugar
 pakistani roj hamaare sainikon ko yamalok bhej rahe hai
 We are giving martyr status to those jawans
 shahid karnal mahadik ko salaamashivasena ne likhaa he ki pichley dinon satara ke karnal santosh mahadik kashmir main shahid hue
 a young officer killed while protecting the country
 jab tirange se lipta unka sharir satara laayaa gaya tab karnal mahadik kii patni ne ranraagini ke aavesh main kaha 'mujhe meri pati ke balidaan par garv he
 They were martyred while protecting the country
 main apane donon beton ko bhi desh ke raksha ke liye sena main bhejuungi
 Wow! well done! What an amazing national anthem! But on the other hand, when Veerapatni is presenting her husband's vermilion with great pride, then the cheeky businessman of this country is betting on playing cricket with the Pakistanis
 satorion kii naa sunen sarkarbhale hi aatankiyon kii goli se nirdosh maare jaayen, bhale hi pakistani aatankiyon dwaara mumbai police ke jawan maare jaay, sharhad par bhale hi hamaare jawan shahid ho, isse in satorion kaa kya lenaa dena? ho saktaa he kii un satorion kaa mat ho kii 7 saal pehle mumbai par hamalaa hi na hua ho
 In the spirit of patriotism alive, it is further written that if India and Pakistan have matches, what will Shiv Sena do? This question is haunting them
 deshbhakti or pakistaniyon ke khilaaf ladane kaa jimmaa sirf shivasena ne le rakhaa he, yah satya he
 But in other political parties, there is only this desolate Ranch left? Government to approve: Shiv Sena has said that the Ministry of External Affairs has not yet approved the decision to play cricket with Pakistanis
 centre sarkaar ko yah dridhtaa isi tarah se kaayam rakh centre sarkaar ko bhartiya cricket board ke utaavlepan ko lagaam lagaani chahie
 Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant has said that we are not against cricket but peace on the border, we are not against cricket but want peace on the border with Pakistan
 saavant ne ummid jataai ki sarkaar desh ke logon kii bhaawanaaon ko samajhakar koi faisla karegi
 We don't hate cricket, the problem is at the borders, says Arvind Sawant (shiv Sena) on indo-pak series

 The Central Government strongly stated in the Lok Sabha on Thursday that it had never claimed to bring back the black money stashed abroad within 100 days of coming to power but it meant that action would be taken within 100 days
 haalanki vipaksh ne inhen 100 dinon ko mudda banaakar sarkaar ko gherne kii koshish jari rakhi
 Rejecting the opposition's allegations in this regard, Parliamentary Affairs Minister m Venkaiah Naidu referred to the bjp's Lok Sabha election manifesto, stating that a task force has been set up to deal with the problem of black money
 naidu ne kaledhan par sadan main hui charchaa main hastkshep karte hue kaha, 'ham itane naasamajh nahin hai ki ham sau dinon ke bheetar sara kaala dhan waapas laane kii baat kahenge
 ' unhone yah pratikriya vipaksh ke in aaropon kii prishthbhumi main kii jinamein aarope lagaaya gaya tha ki bhaajapa netaaon ne satta main aane ke 100 dinon ke bheetar kaala dhan waapas laane kaa vaada kiya tha
 The opposition had questioned that six months had passed since the government promised 100 days of power
 naidu ne kaha ki bhaajapa ke chunavi ghoshnaptr main kaha gaya tha ki yadi satta main aae to sarkaar bhrashtachar ko kam se kam karegi or kaale dhan kaa pataa lagane yaa use waapas laane ke liye kaary bal gathit karegi
 The process of bringing back black money will be initiated
 kaale dhan kii samasya se nipatane ke liye bhaajapa sarkaar dwaara uthaae gaye kadamon kii jaankaree dete hue bhaajapa netaa ne kaha ki jahaan bhi 100 dinon kii baat kahi gai he vahaan iskaa matlab he ki karrwai 100 dinon ke bheetar kii jaaegi
 Naidu claimed that former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh first talked about 100 days to find out black money when he made a statement in Parliament in July 2009
 samaajawaadee party netaa mulaayam singh yadav ne kaha ki janata ne kaala dhan waapas laane ke bhaajapa ke chunaav prachaar par bharosa kiya or isliye sarkaar ko sadan main yah aashwaasan dena chahie ki kaala dhan kab waapas aayega
 He said, 'the youth of the country think that they will get 15 lakh rupees
 aapane unako ek jhooth bechaa
 The government will have to inform Parliament when they will get the money back
 ' Mulayam Singh said that black money should be brought back as soon as the account holders of black money are withdrawing their money
 naidu ne kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf vipakshi naaron ko sunakar unhen dukh hota he
 He elaborated that not even the Finance Minister of the previous UPA government had disclosed the names of people holding accounts of foreign banks
 unhone vipaksh ko aade haath lete hue kaha ki ucchtam nyaayalay ne tatkaaleen samprag sarkaar ko 2011 main nirdesh diya tha ki vah videshon main jamaa dhan ke bare main kadam uthaae lekin koi karrwai nahin kii gai
 Keeping in mind the public sentiments in the Aarushi Talwar murder case, the Law Ministry has asked the CBI to reconsider its report closing the investigation process for the death of this 14-year-old girl
 vidhi mantri em virappa moili ne samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya, ‘sibiai ek swatantra or swytt sanghathan he
 We cannot instruct it
 arushi hatya maamle main jan bhaawanaaon ko dekhte hue hamane sibiai adhikariyon kii ek baithak bulaai he or unase yah kaha he ki is maamle main adaalat ko saunpi gai ‘closer report’ par vah phir se vichaar kare
 Significantly, the CBI submitted a closure report to a court on 29 December
 sibiai ne iske peeche yah vajah bataai thi ki jaanch kaary ko jari rakhane ke liye mauka e vaardaat par koi saboot maujuud nahin he
 In this way, the massacre that shook the entire country two years ago has not yielded any results
 moili ne kaha ki sibiai is maamle kii paryaapt rup se jaanch karne main naakaam rahi
 He said that he would take seriously how such a lapse occurred
 2ji spectrum ghotaale kii jepisi jaanch karaae jane kii maang puri nahin hone kii dasha main sansad ke aagaamee satr kaa vipaksh dwaara bahishkaar kiye jane kii dhamkee ke bare main puche jane par moili ne kaha ki yah ‘gaiyr jimmedaarana bayaanbaji’ he
 "there is a CBI inquiry into the matter and investigation is on with the Committee on Parliamentary Affairs (PAAC)," Moily said on the sidelines of a program at Vishwarya College of Engineering here
 yadi unhen lagata he ki maamle kii iske alaava jepisi jaanch karaaye jane kii bhi aavashyaktaa he to unhen thos aadhaar pesh karnaa hoga or isapar sansad main charchaa kerani hogi
 The law minister said, "his stand threatening to boycott the budget session only shows how careless he is about his duties
" ’ Oarfish was once again found in Japan
 is machhlee ko dekhne ke baad logon ko ek baar phir phukushima bukamp (fukushima Earthquake) kii yaad aa gai
 This time two very rare species of orfish were found on Okinawa Island, Japan
 machhlee pakadaney dweep par gaye machawaron ke jaal main ye 4 meter lambii do machhliyaan funs gayi, lekin okinawa churumi equarium le jane se pehle hi donon mar gayi
 According to the Japan Times, the fisherman became very nervous at first by being caught in the net of these fish
 inamen ek machhlee kii lambaai 4 meter kii thi or duusari kii lambaai 3
 6 meters, which was just 2 of the island
 5 kilometre paas hi jaal main aa gayi
 Let us tell you, Orfish is a rare species of fish found in Atlantic, India and Pacific Ocean
 aisa mana jaataa he ki inkaa pani se baahar dikhnaa bhupank (earthquake) kii ore ishaara karata he
 Shortly before the 2011 Fukushima Earthquake, dozens of orfish were spotted along the sea
 is bhuncup main japan main kareeb 20 hazaar logon ne apni jaan gavaai thi
 However, no fish has been linked to any natural disaster in science
 saal 2019 ke shuruyaat main bhi japan ke samadri kinaaron par orfish ko dekha gaya tha
 This is why many people are nervous

 This time at the Kite Festival to be held on the Makar Sankranti in 'pink City' Jaipur, this time, Karenga adorned with the amazing workmanship of Bareilly will fill

 As such, every year a kite-manjha worth about Rs 10 crore is supplied to Jaipur
 kuch karigar bhi vahaan rojgaar ke liye jate hai, lekin is baar unki sankhya kahin adhik he
 On reaching Jaipur, the artisans got the kite-manjah traders from the time, while they also made the goods according to their choice
 patang ke kaarobaari suhel ansaari ke mutabik har saal 10 karod rupee se adhik kaa patangabaaji kaa saamaan jaipur jaataa he
 There is a huge amount of kite flying merchandise made available to the merchants of Rajasthan and outside states
 yahaan ke kareeb 50 vyapaaree baad main hisaab-kitaab ke liye vahaan jate hai
 He informed that traders visit Jaipur for the Kite Festival every year in November
 is baar notebandi ke chalate kaam band hone ke baad kareeb 250 karigar jaipur palaayan kar gaye hai
 Apart from this, the matter related to the demand to ban cotton manj from NGT is pending in this agency, due to which the traders are making manjha in small quantities
 tippaniyan Kamal Ali, chairman of the Manjha Udyog Kalyan Samiti, said that there has been a significant decrease in the work of kite-manjha in the district
 iskaa bada kaaran notebandi he
 Due to shortage of rupees many traders could not start the work
 iske saath hi engiti main chal rahe maamle ko lekar bhi vyapaaree ashankit hai
 Due to this the production has not done much
 isse yahaan ke saikadon karigar bekaar ho gaye hai
 He told that due to the kite festival on Makar Sakranti, the artisans who went to Jaipur get double the wages of Bareilly
 is kaaran is baar badi sankhya main vahaan karigar gayi hai

 vahaan ke rajasthan or usase baahar ke rajyon ke vyapaariyon ko baari maatra main patangabaaji kaa maal uplabdh karaayaa jaataa he
 About 50 traders here later go there for accounting
 unhone bataaya ki patang mahotsav ke liye vyapaaree har saal november main jaipur jate hai
 This time around 250 artisans have migrated to Jaipur after work stopped due to demonetisation
 iske alaava engiti se sooti maanjhe par bhi roak lagane kii maang sambandhi maamla is abhikaran main lambit hone kii vajah se bhi vyapaaree kam maatra main maanjha bana rahe hai
 The comments maanjha udyog kalyaan samiti ke adhyaksh kamaal ali ne bataaya ki jile main patang-maanjha ke kaam main khaasi kami ai he
 Demonetisation is the major reason for this
 rupee kii killat ke kaaran kai vyapaaree kaam nahin shuru kar paae
 Along with this, traders are also apprehensive about the ongoing case in NGT
 is kaaran utpaadan bahut adhik nahin kiya he

 While President Pranab Mukherjee's hopes of getting a political challenge in the presidential election are getting low, Team Anna is facing a slew of accusations against him
 ye or baat he ki khud anna pranab kii tarif kar rahe hai
 Anna Hazare and his team do not have an opinion on UPA presidential candidate Pranab Mukherjee
 anna pranab ke bare main kuch kehete hai or unki team kuch or anna kii team pranab ko aaropon se gherti he to anna unki tarif karte hai
 Anna has said that Pranab Mukherjee is better than the rest of the cabinet ministers

 i do not want to expand it
 jab koi pyaar main hota he to kuch baaten kahi jaati hai or kuch bina kahe hi samaj lee jaati hai
 The same situation happens for girls when there is a lot going on in their mind, but they are not able to tell it quickly
 aaie jaane, aise hi 10 sicrates jo ladakon ko ladakiyon ke man kii baat bataa denge
 
 
 1
 apni tarif sunnaladakiyaan jab pyaar main hoti hai to vah extra sajati-sanwarti hai kyonki unhen apanepatarnar ke liye taiyarhona acha lagata he
 In such a situation, he feels very good that his boyfriend praises this change
 2
 The caring partner is generally believed that girls are often more attracted to boys with money, but this is not the case
 hameshaa dekha gaya he ki zyaadaatar rishte is isliye tut jate hai kyonki unamem care kii kami hoti he
 So take care and support more than your partner
 3
 There are some secrets of one's life that they do not want to share with anyone, but it is always in the mind of the girls to know the truth
 agar aapaki patarnar aapse kuch jaananaa chaahe to usase kuch na chhipaaen
 This is a good thing for both of you as it will work to bring both the truth and the conversation closer to each other
 4
 Avoid giving advice Because of their loveliness and excess love to girls, boys often impose their suggestions on them without hearing their problems
 aisa karne se bachein kyonki ladakiyon ko is tarah kii baaten bilukal pasand nahin hoti
 If he is upset about anything, then listen to him well before giving advice to him
 5
 Do not let the romance end, after getting the romance, often the boys stop paying attention to them and gradually the relationship starts falling short of romance and love
 aisa kabhi bhi na karen
 Girls like to keep romance in the relationship
 isliye yah jaruri he ki aapkaa rishta chaahe nayaa ho yaa purana usamen romance kaa tadakaa lagaate rahiye

 sanjay lila bhansaali kii film padmavati lagaataar vivaadon main bani hui he
 The film's producers postponed its release after mounting protests
 isi dauraan padmavati ko lekar akhil bhartiya kshatriya mahasabha kaa dilli ke taal katoraa stadium main milan samaaroh yojit kiya gaya
 People of Rajput society have come from different states across the country
 har koi film kaa virodh karata dikhaai diya
 Women also participated in this performance
 akhil bhartiya kshatriya mahasabha ke kaaryakarini ke adhyaksh mahendra singh tanvar kaa kahana he kii film main hamen kai diqqatein hai
 First of all, the name of the film itself is not correct
 padmavati
 
 
 
 ye kya hota he? maa padmavati naam hona chahie
 Queen 
 
 
 virangana 
 
 
 
 devi
 
 
 
 ye naam hone chahie
 The second thing that song is being shown is Ghoomar
 
 
 
 
 
 There is also objection in that
 rani padmavati ne aisa kabhi nrity nahin kiya
 It should not be either
 hamaare itihaas ke saath ye chhedachad he
 They will not be released
 kya jhooth bol rahe hai padmavati ke nirmaataa? sensor ne waapas kar di he filmadipika kii naak kaat denge ,ye kehane vaale log galatamahendra singh tanvar kaa kahana he kii jo log aisa kehete hai ki deepika kii naak kaat denge, bhansaali kaa sar kaat denge, wo log galat hai
 Rajput society respects every woman
 wo chaahe koi bhi hon
 Deepika is an actress
 hamaari ladaai kisi se nahin
 But we do not want any film to be made on Rani Padmavati
 unhen nrity karte dikhaaya jaae
 Some people also said that if the film is released and if any cinema halls burn, then the central government and the state government will have all the responsibility
 is milan samaaroh main tay hoga ki film padmavati release hone denge yaa nahin? kul milakar rajput samaaj film release nahin hone dena chahta
 The film Padmavati's makers, who have been continuously facing opposition from many organizations, have finally postponed the release of the film
 vycom 18 moshan pikchars kii ore se jari ek aadhikarik bayaan main kaha gaya he ki 1 disambar 2017 ko relies hone ja rahi film padmavati ko sthagit kiya gaya he
 Was Padmavati's release postponed? Not only for Jeet Karni Sena, but only for the benefit of what Bhansalijan said in the statement: In this statement issued by Viacom 18 Motion Pictures, the studio that has worked behind the making of 'padmavati' voluntarily, on 1 December The film postpones the 2017 release
 sabase pratibhashali film nirmaataaon main ek sanjay lila bhansaali ke saath vaiakom 18 moshan pikchars ne ek sundar cinemai masterpis banaai he 'padmavati'
 In which Rajput heroism, dignity and tradition are filmed
 yah film ek aisi kahani he jo sabhi bharatiyon ko garv se bhar degi or duniya bhar main hamaare desh kii kahani ko bayaan karne ke kaushal kaa pradarshan karti he
 ' lakhanuh kisi bhi vidha kii rachana farm ke kaaran nahin, kathy kii drushti se mahatvapurn hoti he
 This was stated by Dr
 Hariom in a seminar organized by the State Employees Literature Institute at the Eiffel Club, Lucknow, on the theme of 'future of the new song and future of the new song'
 hindi ke janemaane gajalgo, kathakaar, kavi evam rajya karmchaaree sahitya santhaan ke adhyaksh dow hariom ke saannnidhya main is vishay par ek charchaa sangoshtee kaa aayojan hua
 During this time, the Eiffel Club auditorium of Aldico Greens of Lucknow was packed with local and outside lyricists
 is sangoshtee main suparichit navageetkaar maheshwar tiwari, dow indivar, dow om nishchal, om prakaash tiwari va madhukar ashthasana ne hissedari kii
 Poornima Burman's presence in UAE was notable
 sangoshtee ke uddeshyon par prakaash daalate hue sansthagan ke varisht upaadhyaaksh evam suparichit navageetkaar tathaa pratham satr ke sanchaalak dow ravishankar pandeya ne aaj ke kavita paridrishy main navagit ke bhavishya evam bhavishya ke navagit ko lekar anek dhyatavya bindu saamne rakhe tathaa beej vaktavy ke liye navagit aalochak da indivar ko aamantrit kiya
 Dr
 Indivar discussed in detail the current challenges facing the newcomer keeping in mind the emergence, development and problems of the new song
 unhone gitangini se navagit pravartan kii baat ko asweekaar karte hue shambhunath singh dwaara pehali baar navagit kaa ullekh karne ke baad navagit kii sthapana kii aitihaasik bhoomika ko rekhaankit kiya
 He said that the standards of the new song need to be complied with so that the relevance and significance of the new song according to the time and situation of the country is proved
 hindi kavita va geet ke samalochak dow om nishchal ne kaha navagit abhi navagit pravartan kii daavedaari ke jhagade ko lekar hi ulajhaa hua he isiilie geet kii samiksha ke kshetra main koi ullekhneey kaam nahin ho sakaa he
 He said that Nirala also had a standard about poetry that the proponent of free verse is its flow, so the song has to take care of its chandelic discipline, flow, rhythm, yeti and tempo
 yah avashya he ki chand kii apni seemaa hoti he, isliye nai kavita ke geetkaar nae kavy kii ore mud gaye
 But the irony is that critics of the new poem are hesitant to consider it part of the poetic complex, which is to ignore the genres of poetry
 dow nishchal ne kaha ki navagit hone ke pehle vah geet he tathaa iske baavjood vah kavita kaa hi ek rup he, usase baahar nahin he, isliye kavyashastra kii kasautiyaan us par bakhubi lagu hoti hai
 The new song will have to be modern in its language, its story and style and it will have to protect its sound beauty, which the well-known poet and composer Girijakumar used to do geet jivan ke kriya vyapaar se alag nahin he
 Only when it comes to objectivity will it be rich in terms of localism, regionalism, crafts and images
 unhone kaha ki gambhir kavita tak jan maanas ko pahunchane ke liye geet navagit ek pul banaate hai at: inhen bhi kavita ke paathyakramon main rakhaa janaa chahie jisase samaaj main chand, lay, geet or navagit ke prati ek suruchi paidaa ho
 Well-known storyteller, Gajalgo and President of the State Employees' Sahitya Sansthan, Dr
 Hariom said that we must think about which path of the future we would like to choose for ourselves
 yah is baat par bhi nirbhar karata he ki samaaj ko kya dekar janaa chahenge
 He said that i have no prejudice with the genres, nor are we biased towards gender or caste-religion
 hamen yah dekhnaa chahie ki sab kuch acha nahin he to sab kuch kharaab bhi nahin he
 If the road is bad then it is also built
 isi tarah rachanaprakriya kaa rasta hota he
 We should think before writing the song Ghazal or poem why we are writing it
 bhale hi koi ghazal ko na maane, geet ko na maane par dushyant ne jab gajalen likhin to kisi kaa dhyaan uske farm par nahin tha balki is par tha ki unhone likhaa kya he
 How strong is his story? How strong that sensory and sensory knowledge is, as Muktibodh has said
 unka kahana tha ki muktibodh yaa tulsi apane kavyarupon ke kaaran nahin balki apane kathy ke kaaran mahatvapurn maane jate hai
 Dr
 Hariom said that singing is not the significance of poetry nor is it a good composition only if it is remembered
 puraane farm main nai baat kehane kaa salika ho to us par sabakaa dhyaan jaataa he
 If a method of creation is new, they too will surely be tested on the criteria of poetry
 duusari sabase ahm baat yah ki sabhi vidhaaen ahm hai basharte unamem pratirodh kaa swar vidyaman ho
 Presiding over the session, eminent newcomer Dr
 Maheshwar Tiwari said that there is no need to worry about the future of the newcomer
 jab tak kavita main jijeevishaa va saamaajikta he tab tak kavita or geet kii praasangikta bani rahegi
 He said that newcomers should increase the scope of their studies
 unhone kaha ki navagit ne kaaphi lanbaa rasta tay kiya he tathaa iske bheetar kathy, shilp va andajebyan kii shinaakht kii ja sakati he
 Newcomer Om Prakash Tiwari, who hails from Mumbai, said that there is no need to be worried about the future of the new song, nor has it lost its land
 nai peedhee apane anuroop navagit kaa maarg prashasti karengi
 He said that through his efforts, he had established Jagannath Das Ratnakar Shodhpeeth in Awadh University in collaboration with Governor Ram Naik for research and study of Chandas poetry, which should be adequately utilized
 navageetkaar jai chakravarti ne kaha ki navgiton main jo pravaah paidaa ho rahaa he usamen chand ke maanak ko lekar shithilataa dekhi jaati he tathaa unhone navagit kii praasangikta ke prati apni aashwasti jaahir kii
 New song critic Madhukar Ashtana said that the rhythm of the new song should not be a drag like film songs
 chand kaa anushaasan maanya hona chahie
 Taking the discussion further, Rajendra Verma and Nirmal Shukla also put forward their views
 navagit kaa bhavishya or bhavishya kaa navagit sangoshtee kaa sucharu sangyojan rajya karmchaaree sahitya santhaan ke mahaamantri dow dineshchandra avasthi evam varisht upaadhyaksh dow ravishankar pandeya ne kiya
 Dr
 Hariom referred to the achievements of the institute in the direction of encouraging the creative interests of the state employees and hoped that such creative seminars would continue to be done in future also
 ullekhneey he ki kisi bhi rajya main sarkari karmiyon ke sarjanaatmak protsaahan ke liye aisa santhaan nahin he jo is paimaane par kaarykram karata ho or sarkari lekhakon kii srujandharmita ko puraskrit karata ho

 padhein film vans apon e time in mumbai dobaaraa kaa film rivyuu, sirf 10 points main After besieging the government on the issue of land acquisition and real estate, Rahul Gandhi has now started raising questions about the plight of farmers in Amethi
 guuruuvaar ko loksabhaa main rahul gandhi ne amethi main food park ko band karne kaa mudda uthaaya
 Rahul claimed that the Prime Minister had assured to do politics of change, not change during elections
 lekin jis tarah se amethi main food park ko band kiya gaya he usase saaf he ki pradhanmantri badlaav kii nahin, badale kii raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 After this charge, the political temperature suddenly increased
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki unhen pradhanmantri kii baat bahut acchhee lagi thi ki wo badale kii nahin, badlaav kii raajnneeti karnaa chaahate hai, lekin jin paristhitiyon main amethi main food park band kiya gaya he wo galat he
 Rahul said that due to the closure of the food park, the farmers of Amethi are not getting the right amount of their crop
 loksabhaa main rahul ke tazaa hamalon kii is nai kadi kaa jawaab sarkaar ne aashwaasan se diya
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that he will gather information related to this matter to Rahul Gandhi himself
 lekin sadan se baahar nikalate hue rahul ne saafe kar diya ki is aashwaasan se wo santusht nahin hai
 When NDTV asked Rahul Gandhi how satisfied he was with Rajnath Singh's assurance, Rahul said that the question is whether the government accepts this project or not
 haalanki rahul ne ye bhi kaha ki wo maujuuda paristhiti main sarkaar ke jawaab kaa intazaar karenge
 When NDTV asked Mulayam, caught in the middle of this political tussle over Amethi, he first seemed to be trying to avoid speaking anything on the issue
 tippaniyan However, he later said that his government is developing in Amethi
 udhar amethi main rahul se chunaav haar chukin smriti irani ne rahul ko gheraa or poocha ki unhone amethi ke vikaas ke liye kya kiya he
 Raising the question of land acquisition first, real estate and now the farmers of Amethi, where Rahul Gandhi is trying to regain his lost political land on the one hand, on the other hand he is also trying to put the government in the dock with the help of these issues
 
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki apni is nai raajnneetik kavayad main wo kitna safal ho pate hai
 In the Lok Sabha on Thursday, Rahul Gandhi raised the issue of the closure of the food park in Amethi
 rahul ne daawa kiya ki pradhanmantri ne chunaavon ke dauraan badale kii nahin, badlaav kii raajnneeti karne kaa aashwaasan diya tha
 But the way the food park in Amethi has been closed, it is clear that the Prime Minister is doing politics of change, not change
 is aarope ke baad achaanak raajnneetik taapmaana kuch bad ho gaya
 Rahul Gandhi said that he liked the Prime Minister's point that he wanted to do politics of change, not change, but the circumstances under which the food park in Amethi has been closed is wrong
 rahul ne kaha ki food park band hone kii vajah se amethi ke kisaanon ko unki fasal kii sahi kameet nahin mil paa rahi he
 The government responded to this new episode of Rahul's recent attacks in the Lok Sabha with assurance
 grih mantri rajnath singh ne kaha ki wo rahul gandhi ko khud is maamle se judi jaankaree ikattha kar suchit karenge
 But stepping out of the house, Rahul made it clear that he was not satisfied with this assurance
 enditivi ne jab rahul gandhi se poocha ki wo rajnath singh ke aashwaasan se kitna santusht hai to rahul ne kaha ki sawaal ye he ki sarkaar is project ko sweekaar karti he yaa nahin
 However, Rahul also said that he will wait for the government's answer in the current situation
 amethi par is raajnneetik khinchataan ke bich fanse mulaayam se jab enditivi ne poocha to wo pehle is mudde par kuch bolne se bachane kii koshish karte dikhe
 The comments haalanki baad main kaha kii amethi main unki sarkaar vikaas kar rahi he
 On the other hand, Smriti Irani, who had lost to Rahul in Amethi, surrounded Rahul and asked what he had done for the development of Amethi
 pehle zamin adhigrahan phir real estate or ab amethi ke kisaanon kaa sawaal uthaakar jahaan rahul gandhi ek taraf apni khoyi hui raajnneetik zamin hasil karne kii koshish kar rahe hai vahiin duusari taraf inhen muddon ke sahare sarkaar ko katghare main khadaa karne kii koshish bhi kar rahe hai

 It was an archeological name given to the site when excavations began in the 1920's
 This Mohenjodaro trailer is severe ROFL
 Someone on the team knows that the original name of the Indus age settlement was most probably not Mohenjodaro, right? : d @ champdev_ @ kamaalrkhan Are they showing reality?

 com / 5fjyumo1jd— Ashish Khetan (@aashishkhetan)february 29, 2016 Generally, the songs make the singers bigger, but what Kishore Kumar sang, the song became bigger
 abhinayta, gayak, compoger, patakatha lekhak, nirmaataa, nirdeshak tamaam khaasiyat ek hi shaks main
 Life is a journey Suhana, the queen of my dreams and Kishore Kumar, who gave me the best songs in my front window, was born on August 4, 1929 
 jaanate hai unase judi kuch khaas baaten1
 Kishore Kumar was born on 4 August 1929 in the city of Khandwa, Madhya Pradesh, to a prominent lawyer, Keylal
 dakshini dhruv par pahunchane vaala duniya kaa pehla shaks koun tha, jaaniye2
 Kishore Kumar's real name was Abhas Kumar Ganguly
 kishor kumaar apane bhai bahanon main duusare nambar par the
 3
 unhone indaur ke chrishchiyan college main padhe the or unki aadat thi college kii canteen se udhaar lekar khud bhi khaanaa or doston ko bhi khilaanaa
 4
 vah aisa samay tha jab 10-20 paise kii udhari bhi bahut myne rakhti thi
 When Kishore Kumar's loan of five rupees twelve was lent out to the canteen and when the owner of the canteen asked him to pay his five rupees twelve, he would sit in the canteen and play a glass and spoon on the table for five rupees twelve ana and sing several tunes
 Used to take out and ignore the canteen
 aise kalamnigaar jo aadhunik hindi kavita ke kahalaaye rashtrakavi5
 Kishore Kumar debuted as an actor in the film Shikari (1946)
 6
 His elder brother Ashok Kumar played the lead role in this film
 unhen pehali baar gane kaa mauka mila 1948 main bani film ziddee main, jisamen unhone dev anand ke liye gaanaa gaaya
 7
 kishor kumaar KL sahagal ke jabardast prashansak the, isliye unhone yah geet un kii style main hi gaaya
 Despite the stubborn success, he neither got recognition nor got any special work
 8
 It is also interesting that Mohammad Rafi lent his voice for Kishore Kumar in many of Kishore Kumar's debut films
 mohammad rafi ne film‘raagini’or‘sharaarat’ main kishor kumaar ko apni aawaaj udhaar di to mehtaanaa liya wo bhi sirf ek rupaya
 9
 kaam ke liye kishor kumaar sabase pehle es di burman ke paas gaye the, jinhone pehle bhi unhen 1950 main bani film 'pyaar' main gane kaa mauka diya tha
 SD Burman then gave him a chance to sing a song in the film 'bahar'
 costum dizin main inkaa koi tod nahin, dilaayaa desh ko pehla OSCAR10
 According to media reports, the then Information and Broadcasting Minister Vidyacharan Shukla prohibited the broadcast of Kishore Kumar's songs from AIR (AIR) in 1975 when he refused to attend a government function during the Emergency in the country
 And income tax raids were also conducted at Kishore Kumar's house
 11
 He holds the record for 8 Filmfare Awards for any male playback singer
 12
 This Sartaj of tunes showed his strong acting in films like Half Ticket, Padosan, Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi
 13
 Even though Kishore Da is not among us today, but the memorable songs that are still chanted today: - The man who gave two Prime Ministers to India
 
 
 - rup tera mastaana
 
 - ek ladki bhigi - bhaagi si
 
 
 
 - mere mehboob qayaamat ho
 
 
 - Sea shore
 
 Kishore Da has no idea how many songs have become immortal forever
 13 oktober 1987 ko unhone duniya ko alavida kah diya
 The United States and India on Wednesday agreed to strengthen security and civil nuclear cooperation and to build 6 American nuclear power plants in India

 "we are committed to strengthening bilateral security and civil nuclear cooperation, as well as building 6 US nuclear power plants in India", the joint statement of the two countries said
 haalanki bayaan main parmaanu urja sanyantron ke bare main or jaankaree nahin di gai he
 Significantly, under the leadership of Donald Trump, America is seeing all the possibilities in India, the world's third largest oil buyer, and in this series, it wants to sell more energy products to India
 aapako bataa den ki donon desh kareeb ek dashak se bharat ko america newclear riectors kii aapurti par manthan kar rahe the
 However, due to rules and regulations, the matter could not come back on track yet
 karnataka main asthirataa kaa khatra jhel rahi sattarudh bijepi ko raahat dete hue rajya ke rajyapal hansraj bharadwaj ne shanivaar ko kaha ki party ke 13 vidhayakon ke istife kii ghoshnaa ke baavjood jagadish shettar sarkaar ko bahumat hasil he
 However, Bhardwaj said that if he felt that the state government had reached a minority then he would have to undergo a power test in the House
 unhone ganatantr diwas samaaroh ke baad shettar kii maujuudagi main samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki jis din sarkaar alpamat main pahunch gai chaahe ek vidhayak kam ho, main notice jari karuunga
 At present, 13 mlas have resigned but the government is still in the majority
 bharadwaj ne kaha ki shettar jab tak mukhyamantri hai, vah unki salaah par kaam karenge lekin unki sarkaar ke bahumat khone par aisa nahin karenge
 He said, 'I will not do any unconstitutional work
 main dekh rahaa hum
 ' aaj phir ek dil tut gaya or ek pyaar bharaa rishta khatm ho gaya
 i could not understand what happened? How can an 8-year-old love end with just a few talks and quarrels? How can someone go by giving you the biggest pain in the world, who has ever made your friends laugh unnecessarily? Have you ever gone through such pain and worry or you have understood the pain of breaking the heart of someone special
 kai baar hamaare aasapaas aise ghatnaayen dekhne ko milti hai jahaan par samaj hi nahin aata ki kyonek pyarbhara rishta tut gayaor sab khatm ho gaya
 Sometimes there are reasons but it is not so big that such a big decision of life should be taken
 kai baar to samaj hi nahin aata kii ye sab hua kyon lekin kuch na kuch to aisa hota hi he jo rishte ko andar tak tod detaa he
 Let us know, some such things which may be the reason for cheating in the relationship
 
 
 1
 It has been seen many times that our self-esteem is lost so much in love that it keeps on respecting itself and starts accepting everything from the partner
 pyaar samarpan maangata he lekin kai baar dekha gaya he ki isi baat kaa saamne vaala vyakti phayda uthaane lagata he or kahin na kahin aage jaakar ye baat bhi dhokhaa dene kaa kaaran banati he
 2
 jab partner aapkaa sammaan karnaa chhod dejab rishta shuru hota he to ek-duusare kii choti-badi har baat kaa dhyaan rakhana laazmi hota he
 But when the relationship starts to break up, then these things start to fall short
 jab aapkaa partner aapaki baton or chizon ko granted lene lage to samaj jaaie ke ab isrishte main sammaan or pyarasb khatm hone laga he
 3
 partner ko kho dene kaa dauksar dekha gaya he ki nae rishte kii shuruyaat main partner ko lekar ek ajeeb tarah kaa dar dil main rahata he lekin yahi dar lambey samay tak chalane vaale rishton main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 This is the fear, many times people cheat because of this fear of commitment
 agar aapkaa partner aapako kisi bhi tarah ke kamitment dene se batch rahaa he to samaj janaa chahie ki rishta jald hi tuutane kii kagaar par he
 4
 kahin wo aapse bor to nahin ho gaerishte main jo taazgi or pyaar shuruaati dinon main mahasoos hota he kuch saalon baad isi cheez kii kami mahasoos hone lagati he
 By the way most people adopt a lot of funds to overcome this deficiency, but nowadays people are starting to change their partner and if your partner is also boring every day, then understand that he no longer wants to take this relationship forward

 The easiest way to escape from responsibilities is to find a fraud only when there is a shortage
 agar aap bhi aisa sochate hai to jaraa is baat par gaur farmaaen
 People cheat to run away from responsibilities easily because there is no easy way to get rid of any relationship or human being
 agar kabhi bhi aapako apane partner main aisi koi baat dikhe to thodaa satark ho jane main hi bhalaai he
 Many times people also come to life just to use you and make emotional flowers
 aise main khud ko majboot or samajhadaar banaaen rakhane main hi bhalaai he taaki sahi insaan ko jindagi kaa hissaa banaaya ja sake
 Dussehra is a prosperous festival in many forms, celebrated as the victory of untruth over truth
 dharmagranthon main aswin yani kwar maah ke shuklapaksh kii dashami ke din alag-alag samay par do ghatnaon kaa zikr miltaa he, jinhen ham mahisasur mardan or ravanavadh ke naam se jaanate hai
 In order to save wife Sita from the clutches of Ravana, Shriram slaughtered Darshanan and thus religion prevailed over unrighteousness
 lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki is kahani ke alaava dashahara se judi kuch or bhi baaten hai, jise zyada log nahin jaanate
 Many rituals are also associated with Dussehra, which people have been following for many years
 mangal bhawan-in ke acharya bhaskar ameta bataate hai ki manyataon ke anusaar, ravan ke vadh or lanka vijay ke pramaan swaroop shriram sena lanka kii raakh apane saath le ai thi, isi ke chalate ravan ke putale kii asthiyon ko ghar le jane kaa chalan shuru hua
 Apart from this, there is also a belief that keeping the ashes of Swarnalanka made by Dhanapati Kubera in the vault is inhabited by Kubera itself and happiness in the house remains prosperous
 yahi kaaran he ki aaj bhi ravan ke putale ke jalane ke baad uske asthi-avshesh ko ghar laana shubh mana jaataa he or is se nakaaratmak shaktiyaan ghar main pravesh nahin karti hai
 Ashwinsya site pakshe dashayamya tarkodaye sa kaalo vijayo gyeyah sarvakaryarthsiddhye
arthath kwar maah main shuklapaksh kii dashami ko taron ke udaykaal main mrityu par bhi vijaifal dilaane vaala kaal mana jaataa he
 In Sanatan culture, Dussehra is the symbol of victory and utmost auspiciousness, the festival of victory over good over evil and untruth over truth, that is why this festival is also called Vijayadashami
 dakshin bharat ke dravid brahmanon main ravan ke putale ke dahan se pehle uskaa pujan karne kii parampara he
 Ravana, the only scholar on earth, had the ability to see Trikala
 ravan ke gyaan or vidwata kii prasansha shriram ne bhi kii
 This is the reason why the tradition of worshiping Ravana in Dravidian Brahmins is considered to be excellent, in many places there is a practice of fasting on the day of Ravana combustion
 dashahara ke parv par manushya apni das prakaar kii buraaiyon ko chhod saktaa he
 These include matsar, ego, laziness, kama, anger, item, greed, fascination, violence and theft
 agar aapke paas inamen se koi bhi buraai he, to is dashahara main us burani ko ravan ke putale ke saath hi bhasma kar dijie
 People have been taking measures for centuries to make their entire year happy in Dussehra's Sarvasiddhi Muhurta
 in upayon main shami vriksh kii puja, ghar main shami kaa ped lagaakar niyamit dipadaan karnaa shubh mana jaataa he
 It is believed that on the day of Dussehra, Kubera gave gold to King Raghu and made Shami leaves into gold, since then Shami is considered to be a tree giving gold
 dashahara ke din nilkanth darshan ko bhi shubh mana jaataa he

 aaj baat aise kalamkaaron or unke sachai kii, jinke sach ne kuch logon ko itnaa baichaiyn kar diya ki wo isse ghabaraakar kalamkaaron ko hi nishaanaa banane lage
 The incident of the murder of a journalist in UP and now MP is the proof of this
 faqat 19 dinon ke faasale par hue in donon hi vaakyon mendo patrakaron ko sach bolne kii aisi sazaa mili, jiske bare main sun kar hi rongte khadey ho jate hai
 The only difference is that the last time a journalist was burnt alive for not keeping his mouth shut, then this time in the crime another journalist was burnt to death and burnt his body and that too in such a way that the family members Aziz had to be identified with his key-ring and pieces of undressed clothing
 jamhuriyat ko munh chidhaate ye donon vaakye agar jaan par khel kar kaam karne vaale patrakaron kii hakeekat bayaan karte hai, to ye bhi bayaan karte hai ki kis tarah satta se kurbat rakhanevaale maffiaon ne qaayade-kaanoon ko apane pairon kii juuti samaj rakhaa he
 The latest case is of Balaghat in Madhya Pradesh
 
 
 kantgi, balaghatshuukravaar, raat 9:30 bajaapani kalam se mafiaon or avaidh dhandhebaazon kii neend haraam karanevaale patrkaar sandip kothaari is rose bike par ghar laut rahe the
 Along with Kothari, a friend of his, Lalit Rahangadale was also present on the bike
 lekin raat ko donon jaise hi ek sunsaan jagah par pahunche, peeche se ai ek car ne pehle to unhen takkar maar kar zamin par gira diya or phir car se utre teen logon ne unki pitayee shuru kar di
 The style of the attackers was as if they had already sat ambush
 unhone marpet kar kothaari ke dost lalit ko to maukey se bhaga diya, lekin sandip kothaari ko apane saath uthaa le gaye
 That was the last time anyone saw Kothari alive
 iske baad kothaari kaa dost lalit kisi tarah lift maang kar katangi thane pahunchaa or sari baat bataai
 On his complaint, the police came on the occasion on the night itself, but look at the situation that despite all this, the police could not find any clue of the killers then
 lalit hamalaavaron ko pahachaanata to nahin tha, lekin uske bataae hulie ke mutabik police ne duusare din yani shanivaar shaam ko vishaal tandi or brajesh daharwaal naam ke do logon ko dhar dabocha
 By that time it was too late
 police kii maane to tandi or daharwaal ne apane ek or saathi rakesh nriswani ke saath milakar kothaari kii jaan lene kii baat kubul kar lee
 Both of them first strangled Kothari to death in a moving car, and then in the night, his body was burnt by diesel on the side of a railway track in Wardha, Maharashtra, outside Madhya Pradesh
 laash dekh pahchaan hui naammumkinmadhya pradesh kii police ab donon kii nishandehi par laash baraamad karne ke liye ravivaar kii subah wardha pahunchi, lekin wardha police ne kothaari kii laash shanivaar ko hi baraamad kar lee thi
 Seeing the condition of the corpse was also impossible to identify him
 lekin uske gharavaalon ne kisi tarah bachi-khuchi chizon ko dekh kar uski pahchaan kar lee
 Police is still searching for the third accused in the case, Nriswani
 lekin is vaakye ne balaghat or aas-paas ke ilaake main manganeez kii avaidh khudaai or duusare kaale dhandhon kii pole khol di he
 Now, where the people of Kothari's house are demanding justice, the politics in Madhya Pradesh has also increased
 lekin haqiqat yahi he ki in tamaam shor ke bich qaatil kuch der ke liye hi sahi sachai kii awaz ko khamosh karne main kaamyaab ho gaye
 On the other hand, compensation was announced in the case of murder of Jagendra, a journalist from Shahjahanpur, and justice was also assured
 lekin jo sabase bada sawaal patrkaar par hamale ke vakt khadaa tha, wo ab bhi jas kaa tas khada he
 It is a question of how long the law's long hands will reach the accused minister
 jagendra ko ab tak insaaf nahinhukumat ke chehre bhi ajeeb hote hai
 Sometimes a journalist is accused of burning alive to suppress the voice of truth on the rule
 to kabhi vahi hukumat is dabati awaz se bhadki chingaari ko shant karne ke liye apni tijori kaa munh khol detaa he
 a fortnight has passed since the death of the jaunty journalist Jagendra Singh of Uttar Pradesh, but look at the fact that the family members of Jagendra, who are in deep trouble, still have to sit for justice, stumbling rate by rate

 On Monday, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav met the family members of Jagendra who had been sitting on a dharna for the last several days, and where he announced compensation of Rs 30 lakh to Jagendra's family and to give jobs to both his sons
 That if the backward class welfare minister Ramamurthy Singh Verma was found guilty in this case of burning the journalist alive, then the link against him was also Rwai will
 khabaron ke mutabik kuch pulisavaalon ne shahjahanpur ke rahane vaale patrkaar jagendra singh ko 1 june ko unke ghar main ghus kar zindaa jala diya tha
 After this, he kept fighting to the death for seven days and during this time he not only took the name of his killers, but also revealed the whole plot
 ab bhi khaadi tak nahin pahunchi khaakikanoon ke haath aaropee khaaki tak to pahunche, lekin khaadi phir bhi bachane main kaamyaab rahi
 The family members of Jagendra Singh are believed to have been murdered at the behest of Uttar Pradesh Welfare Minister Ramamurthy Singh Verma
 chunki jagendra kaaphi dinon se mantri ramamurti singh verma ke khilaaf apane fasebuk pej par likh rahe the
 Verma was angry with him and it was at his behest that the policemen carried out the incident
 haalanki is afsosna kahani kaa yahi ant nahin he
 According to the family members, some people are now threatening to do even more bad consequences if they open their mouths and the police is also saving the minister
 lekin patrakaron ke saath zulmo sitam kaa silsilaa isse aage bhi jari he
 Just a fortnight has passed since the murder of Jagendra that the journalist was once again targeted in Shahjahanpur

 After garlanding the statue of Jawaharlal Nehru in Patna, Nitish asked the President to impose President's rule in Maharashtra, what to do when no government is formed?

 darasal, yah jameen krishi yogya thi lekin dastavejon main ise akrushi yogya bhoomi qaraar diya gaya or maamuli daam lagaae gaye
 Not only this, the investigation officers did not take action even after the information about the case came to light
 isliye un adhikariyon ke khilaaf bhi ab karrwai ho sakati he
 Any gifted land cannot be bought and sold, but the pressure mechanism was used in this case
 munde ne 1991 main jagamitra sugar factory ke liye 24 acre jameen kharidi kii thi
 Rajbhau Phad first filed a complaint with the police station to protest against the illegal transaction
 jab police ne koi karrwai nahin kii to unhone adaalat kii sharan lee
 In the case, Munde's lawyer has said that at the time when this land deal was done, Deshmukh had its rights
 unhen isaki jaankaree nahin thi ki yah krishi yogya jameen he
 His lawyer Thombre has accused of hatching a conspiracy to give a political twist to the whole episode

 ayodhya vivaad par adalati faisle ke baad muslimon se sampark saadhane ke prayaas main lalu ek prakaar se bade sadhe hue andaaj main apane pattey khol rahe hai
 a hallmark of Lalu's chicks was seen on Wednesday
 rajd supremeo ne alpsankhyakon ko congress ko vot karne ke prati aagaah karte hue kaha, ‘congress, sangh parivaar se bhi adhik khatarnaak he
 'lalu compared the Congress to the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which comes without any signal and produces a deadly disease of dengue after biting
 vahiin rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ko anophellis machhar kaa visheshan dete hue lalu ne kaha ki vah bhanabhanate hue katata he

 lalu ne naaraa diya ‘rabari nahin chingaari’
 Lalu, who announced his wife's withdrawal from the two assembly constituencies of Raghopur and Sonpur, even challenged Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi to show him the courage to compete against the former chief minister if he is to test his popularity
 lalu ne aarope lagaaya, ‘nitish ko mauka mili to vah chand par bhi mukhyamantri banane kaa avasar nahin chukenge

 ’lalu kii aath panktiyon kii kavita kaa jawaab mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne ‘munaadi’ se diya taaki rajd supremeo kii bolti kisi prakaar se band karaayi ja sake
 Taking inspiration from renowned litterateur and 'munadi' author Dharmveer Bharti, Kumar tried to give a befitting reply to the RJD supremo
 chaar november 1974 ko lokanayak jaiprakash narayan par hue hamale ke baad bharti ne congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue ‘munaadi’ likhi thi
 Kumar's proclamation is as follows: 'khalk Khuda's, Mulk Badshah's, the ruling city of Kotwal, every Khasoam is warned that the Maharaja is going through a metamorphosis, moving out of his homes, completing his five years Surrender of earnings to Karind or else the rate of interest will increase

 Otherwise the interest will increase

 MSME industry sector's share of GDP will increase from 29% to 50%: Gadkari old vehicle scrapping policy will reduce the pressure on the roads of cities like delhi-mumbai: Gadkari: Union Minister Nitin Gadkari has said that the government is micro, to create 5 crore jobs Small and Medium Sector (MSME) industry will strengthen the sector
 saath hi isse sakal gharelu utpaada (jidipi) main MSME kii hissedari bhi maujuuda 29% se badhkar 50% ho jaaegi
 According to Gadkari, the emphasis of the government is to promote economic activities in the country as well as strengthen the rural economy again
 gadakari ne guuruuvaar ko kaha, 'pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bharat ko 5-trillian arthvyavastha banane kaa lakshya rakhaa he or ise hasil karne ke liye meraa mantralay agle paanch varshon main paanch karod job paidaa karne par bhi kaam karegaa
 Gadkari described broad gauge metro as economical, efficient and time-saving option
 unhone kaha ki isse dilli, mumbai or bengalooru jaise bade shaharon par dabaav kam hoga
 Road Transport and Highways Construction Minister Gadkari said, 'we are also bringing broad gauge metro to our constituency Nagpur
 ye nagpur ko wardha, bhandara road, ramtek or narkhed se jodega
 Running the metro on broad gauge should be considered, as it makes travel between cities and its satellite cities economical
 misaal ke taur par log meerut yaa panipat main rah sakate hai or aasaani se har din kaam ke liye dilli ja sakate hai, isliye yah shahar ke saath-saath yatriyon ke liye bhi phaayde kii sthiti he
 Gadkari said that at present the cost of construction of metro rail is about Rs 320 crore per km, while the cost of broad gauge metro is around Rs 3 crore per km
 iske alaava, broad gej network kaa upyog karne par lagbhag teen guna adhik yatri itani hi jagah par aa sakate hai
 Also, the speed of metro trains will be much higher than that of express trains
 gadakari ne yah bhi kaha ki unhen puraani kaaron, bason or dopahiyaa vaahanon kii scraping kii niti ko lekar kendriya cabinet ke vichaar kii anumati mil chuki he
 The Finance Ministry has already approved the proposal
 sarkaar bahut jald ise manjuuri de degi
 Bringing a scraping policy for older vehicles will help reduce vehicular congestion in cities like Delhi and Mumbai

 a report released in Britain has revealed shocking
 britain ke sansad bhawan main lage computaron se varsh 2017 ke ant main rojaanaa kareeb 160 baar ashleel websiton ko kholane kii koshish kii gai he
 This report has been released by the Press Association of Britain PA
 pie freedom of information epaoai dwaara praapt aankadon ke mutabik, pichley saal june main hue aam chunaavon ke baad sansadeey network se jude upkarnon se 24,473 baar ashleel websiton ko kholane kii koshish kii gai he
 The report comes at a time when Prime Minister Terryja herself is battling allegations of sexual misconduct at Westminster
 unhen pichley maheene apane puraane dost or mantri damian green ko barkhaast karnaa padaa kyonki varsh 2008 main westoministar daftar ke unke computer main ashleel saamagree milane ke daavon ko lekar unhone police ko gumraah kiya tha
 It is worth noting that Parliamentary Internet is used by mps, Members of the Upper House and their staff
 adhikariyon ne daawa kiya ki adhiktar koshishen jaanboojhkar nahin kii gai thi or haal ke saalon main isamen giravat ai he
 The parliamentary spokesperson told the PA that all pornographic websites on the computer network of Parliament were blocked
 aapako bataa den ki aisa pehali baar nahin he jab sansad main porn dekhne kaa maamla saamne aayaa ho
 Earlier in India also, such action of some mlas came out in an assembly
 yah upanyaas bhartiya sthapaty or samay kaal kii simaaon ko prastut karata he or baar-baar unhen todakar aage nikalataa he
 They evoke the text of sand samadhi and sometimes present a situation in the sharing of both which together is a reflection of new and old configurations
 adbhut he is paath kii maanviya vividhta jo pathak ko na maatr nai lagati he or na niri pracheen
 Spiritual linguistic development, a symbol of sand mausoleum, inadvertently deepens each other's installations
 ret samadhi aaj or kal ke patalon par lekhak ne aise bichaai he, jaise nayaa or puraatan ek duusare kii ankhon main jhaank rahe hai, ek duusare se maang rahe hai vishwa kaa nayaa vinyas
 New narrative of an ancient and a scientific extension
 yah aupnyasik vidha ko ek nayaa rup, nai samvednaa, nai bhashaa, or nae shilp se samrudh karata he
 There is a widespread rejection in this work
 asweekaar har had-sarhad kaa, har paribhaasha kaa, har dwaidh kaa, sthapit sharton kaa
 It is a novel, but it turns out its own way, rejecting the conditions of being a novel
 fansaa he, anivarytah, jivan main or bhashaa main, par donon ko or unki avibhajyata ko apane tareeke se rachataa he
 Characters also break boundaries
 maa budhi he par choti hoti jaati he, sikudta badan bhi par man kii umang bhi
 The daughter goes on aging, becoming the mother's mother, the society is stricken with history
 nadi donon taraf bahati he
 Rosie is both a woman and a man too
 parivaar ekal bhi he or sanyukt bhi
 The aggressive nationalist performance of Hindustan and Pakistan on the Wagah border every evening is acceptable to any public, then all writers and like Bishan Singh of Toba Tek Singh are invalid
 sarhadon ke tuutane kaa silsilaa he ret samadhi
 The novel begins with a peculiar mangalacharan
 ''ek kahani apane aap ko kahegi
 There will be a complete story and also incomplete, as the stories follow
 apane ko kahegi
 And it will be complete, incomplete too
 jaisi har kahani hoti he
 Interesting story 'in which there are borders and women who come, go, start'
 yaheen mil jaati he ek baangi upanyaas kii alag bhashaa, style, vaakya gathjod, dhvanyaatmakataa or andaaje-bayaan kii
 It is pertinent that even simple words are taken here for decipherment
 abhidha gaayab he, khel rahe hai vyanjana or lakshana
 The complete story is also incomplete
 rahasyamayi or agyeya
 'there is always something, then it is the rest
 ' na mitane vaale is baaki ke ehsaas se hataasha nahin aati
 Stubbornness comes
 jaanane kaa hath
 This stubbornness stems from the insistence of knowing more and more through more and more eyes and voices
 maanviya nazren or awaajen hi nahin, pashu-pakshiyon kii bhi nazren or awaajen, unki bhi jo achar hai
 In the sand mausoleum comes a beautiful expression of the importance of all these eyes and voices and the relationship between them: the animal bird nature man
 kisi ek kathavachak kaa mohataaj nahin ye upanyaas
 Many storytellers come and go here
 koi bhi sarvagyaata nahin lekin apni dekhi-bhogi suna jate hai
 Who has seen as much on the spot

 The rustle arose from the other direction and the waves of kisses filled with sandy winds started knocking
 ret samadhi kii khulne kii aahat khilakhilaahat ke saath oonchi ubhari, jaise kisi ne laad or pyaar se uthaaya ho
 As if there is an old tree that rose up and exclaimed, i am the boon of nectar, i create my own body with my drop, what am I? upar vaale ne ham donon ko, stri-purush ko ek bandhan main ek jaisi mahashakti di he
 Joint families, which did not end even when they were finished, burst at the tip of their tales from sand mausoleum and waterfalls like narration
 ret samadhi hili he, jharne or unki santaanen jhamajhama rahi hai
 Some whites, some blacks, some coarse, some thin, many varieties, many shades, borders of streams, flowing on both sides, and many mausoleums of sand spread like deserts
 Mother, eyes in the New Old World Reopens, hears voices, from hundreds of miles away, across the border from where someone has slept, get up very close, son, you are late in reaching the office
 maa-beti main kuch to he aisa jo donon ke bich main nikatataa banaaye rakhata he
 Both are incomplete without each other

 Mother's bangles speak
 beti sirahaane se sir uthaati he ki maa ko chuum le, phir muskaraakar takiye par sar vaapis tikaa diya
 She is mother maa beti kii antarang raajadari
 Breathtaking horror of blooming bodies and intelligence desires

 See the noise of high noise and the mysteries of the body wandering around the Sufis, that there is fluid, Neelambar, there is air, there is a lion, there will also be cow deer

 *** bhartiya mul kii canadai actress sani leone ne apni duusari hindi film jacopot kii relies se pehle kaha he ki ab vah porn filmon main kaam nahin karti hai
 According to Sunny, since taking part in the TV reality show Bigg Boss, he has said goodbye to the adult film industry
 sani ne kaha ki vah hameshaa se film heroin bananaa chaahati thim or khud ko khushkismat maanati hai ki unhen ye mauka mila
 Read Sunny's exclusive interview with Bollywood stars, how was this journey? This is a 360 degree change
 main hameshaa se ek menstream heroin bananaa chaahati thi
 To be honest, it is almost impossible for an adult film star to come to such mainstream cinema
 magar main khushkismat rahi ki mujhe bollywood main or darshakon ke bich sweekaar kiya gaya
 How difficult was it to make a place in Bollywood? i think my path became easier because of Bigg Boss
 har raat 10 baje tivi ke jariye logon ne apane drawing room main baithkar asli sani leone ko dekha
 i cook like any other girl, people are seen cleaning the house
 isse unke dimag main ek nai chhavi bani
 If i had come directly to work in Bollywood films, i would probably never have accepted
 kya aap abhi bhi porn filmon main kaam karti hai?nahin, logon ko ye badi galatfahami he ki main porn filmon main abhi bhi kaam karti hum
 i stopped this job only after coming to Bigg Boss
 jaahir he ki main apane ateet ko yaa jo kuch internet par he, usko nahin hataa sakati
 i started venturing out of acting in porn films in 2008 itself
 us saal maine apane pati ke saath ek production company banaai thi, jo adlt filmein banaati thi
 This was my way of leaving the job of heroine and moving towards becoming a producer
 adlt movie main pehali baar kaam karne kaa aihsaas kaisaa tha?dekhie, aapako ye samajhnaa hoga ki ye ek bijness, ek prafational kaam kii tarah hota he
 This is an industry that has cost billions of dollars and can never fall into recession
 to mere dimag main adlt film karte vakt yahi tha ki zyada se zyada bijness karnaa he, taaki jis produsar ne mujhe sin kiya he, uski ummiido ko jhatka na lage
 When i first worked in a porn film, my partner in it was my boyfriend
 uske baad maine bahut kam logon ke saath hi is tarah kii filmon main kaam kiya
 Who was my partner in the first film and also my boyfriend, now he is my husband
 aapke parivaar ne kaise riect kiya porn industry jwine karne ke faisle par?jaahir he ki kisi or saamaanya parivaar kii tarah ve is faisle se bhounchakke the
 When i told my father, he was angry why he did not discuss them before taking such a big decision
 phir unhone mujhe ek salaah di jo main hameshaa apane dimag main rakhti hum
 He said that whatever you do, you must be successful
 ek patni auki bahan ke taur par sani leone kisi hai?ghar par main kisi saamaanya patni kii tarah hi hoti hum
 My husband and i work together in the kitchen
 film dekhte hai
 As a sister i am very protective of my brother
 main badi hum or ab mere mata-pita nahin hai
 i try not to miss anything
 purushon main kya acha or bura lagata he aapako?mujhe budhimaan purush bahut aakarshith karte hai
 If someone has too much dio or perfume, then my mood gets uprooted

 Welcoming the government's decision to set up a JPC to investigate the 2G spectrum scam, CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yechury said that the Prime Minister has "almost justified that the JPC is not needed and the opposition's demand has been accepted so that Parliament can run
 ’unhone kaha, ‘yadi yah budhimaani pehle dikhaayi gayi hoti to ham sheetakaaleen satr (jisamen jepisi jaanch kii maang par virodh ke kaaran kaamkaaj nahin ho sakaa tha) ko bachaa sakate the
 CPI National Secretary d Raja said that instead of bashing the opposition, the Prime Minister should take a self-criticism stance
 unhone kaha, ‘isi tarah kii sadabuddhi sheetakaaleen satr ke dauraan aani chahie thi
 Yechury said that the Left parties were demanding the JPC to investigate how the entire system was manipulated to allow such a big scam
 makapa netaa ne kaha ki ek ore doorsanchaar mantri kapil sibbal ne kaha ki sarkari khajaane ko koi nuksaan nahin hua to pradhanmantri ne isaki tulana garibon ko khadyannon par mil rahi sabsidi se kar di
 He said, 'singh almost said that the manner in which the spectrum was allocated was actually like the subsidy given to the corporate houses
 ’ yechuri ne kaha ki darasal yah sarkaar kii haalat ko dikhaata he jo dishaheen he
 On the attitude of not assessing the loss to the exchequer on the rates of 3-G spectrum, Yechury said that it should be based on the prices that 'swan' and 'unitech' got after getting the 2G spectrum license
 
 unhone kaha, ‘in donon companiyon main hissedari us keemat se chah guna zyada keemat par bechi gayi jis par unhen sarkaar dwaara license aavantit kiya gaya tha
