 shobhaa mohanparyton kaa matlab hi asthaayee hota he or shaano-shaukat vaala paryaton to or bhi thodaa hota he
 There is no place where you don't blow a lot of diesel-petrol
 isamen un tamaam sahuulaton ko jod dijie jo lagjri ke naam par parosi jaati hai, or phir aapako is baat par jaraa bhi hairaani nahin hogi ki hamaari har yatra, thaharnaa or ghoomana-sab carbon negative hote hai
 Although walking is a luxury in itself, yet we cannot deny the positive side of tourism
 koshish is baat kii honi chahie ki paryaton ke dushprabhavon ko kaise santulit kiya ja sake
 Now there is a growing number of people who are traveling to know, understand, concentrate the mind and return with new energy
 isliye ham agar lagjri ko nae chalan main dhalkar pesh karen to har paryaton hamaari khubasurat dharti ko badi najaakat ke saath dekhnaa or ghoomana-phirana ban ja saktaa he
 The first thing that comes to mind is slow walking
 sahaj bhojan or dhimaa safar har cheez kii gati ko dhimaa karne kii disha main ek saanskrithik badlaav ho saktaa he, taaki hamaara makasad duniyabar ke bhaagambhag vaala saiyr-sapata karke khaas-khaas jagahon ko chune or keval instagram par post karne laayak bhojan karne kaa na rahe
 We travel to lesser places and then the luxury will be that we go peacefully and roam around everywhere and do all those things which are not on the rutted rut
 ham us jagah ke har pahalu kaa bharpoor anand len—bhojan, viraasat, samskruti, log—or phir kisi jagah par lambey samay tak rukne ko hi lagjri mana jaae
 In an increasingly commercialized world, the things we have to compromise are our time, health and our relationships with the people around us
 nae chalan ke lagjri paryaton kaa makasad in sari chizon ko waapas lautaane kii disha main hona chahie or vyavsaayikta ko bhi in saare muddon par dhyaan dene kii disha main khud ko dhaalnaa chahie
 Be it minimal design, eco-friendly architecture or heritage buildings to be molded with a new purpose, guests receive personalized services, addressed by place names instead of their room numbers
 is tarah aap ek zyada sambhddha duniya kii taraf laut sakate hai
 The gardens should be re-protected in such a way that butterflies, birds and other animals are made a natural place in them
 yah sahjivan saamanjasy ke saath jeene kaa ek sabak or sabab bane
 The specialty in such tours is that you stay in a place where your digital contact is lost automatically because there is no internet nor mobile connectivity so that families can get together and enjoy time and food prepared from organic products in local farms and kitchen gardens
 
 isse bhojan kii barbaadi karne vaale baffe kii paripati kii jagah khet se mej tak vaale bhojan kaa chalan bade
 Climate change has knocked on our doors, in such a situation every business has to prepare itself to face the challenges of excesses in all industries
 nae chalan ke lagjri paryaton main yah jimmedaari sailaaniyon par bhi daali jaae ki ve brands kaa chayan karen jo is sankat se waakif ho or is disha main kadam bhi uthaa rahe hon, jaise plastic, khaskar ek baar hi istemaal hone vaale plastic, kaa istemaan na karen, jal sanchayan kii disha main kaam karen, kooday kii ricycling or surakshit tareeke se uske nistaaran ko lekar sakriy hon or bhoomi tathaa baaki sansadhano kaa jimmedaari se istemaal karen
 The day is not far when tourists will arrange their stay based on these standards
 darasal aisa karne kaa samay aa chukaa he!yah to paakhand kii intiha he ki badi companiyaan jimmedaar lagjri kii baat to karen lekin unheen ilaakon main nae hotel kholen jahaan pehle hi se hotalon kii bharmaar he
 That is to say, luxury travel of the new trend has to be a part of the mainstream and it has to be included in the government's tourism manifesto
 nae chalan ke lagjri travel kaa prachlan bade, iske liye jaruri he ki udyog use apanaaen or logon ko vah aakarshak lage
 The hospitality industry cannot run away from accountability to local communities
 isamen sabase pehle to yah baat ganth baandh leni chahie ki sthaneey sansadhano par vahaan ke logon kaa haq hota he or ve sailaaniyon ko keval istemaal ke liye kiraye par die jate hai
 Conservation of heritage and nature, non-motor activities, social interaction with the community and positive impact on their livelihood, underscoring intangible cultural heritage, being sensitive to the use of land and resources — all of these new standards of luxury travel Can
 in sabase paryaton ko lekar shahari pravaas kii pravritiyaan bhi kam hongi
 i am sure that if awareness increases, every tourist can choose such options in their own way in every journey, which ultimately reduces their carbon footprint
 jalwaayu parivartan se badlaav ab majaburi banataa jaataa he or agali peedhishaan ham par dabaav daalen, usase pehle hamen nae chalan ke paryaton kii ore bad janaa chahie, vahi ab rasta bachaa he

 In February 2010, Yasin Bhatkal, an Indian Mujahideen arrested terrorist, ordered 'apple Pie' and 'cold Coffee' before placing a bomb in a German bakery in Pune
 itnaa hi nahin, bekri aate samay usne auto main apane ek sahyatri ko majaak main bag main bam hone kii baat bataa di thi
 According to the news published in the English newspaper 'indian Express', many such surprising things have come up during interrogation of Yasin
 pichley maheene bharat-nepal seemaa se giraftaar bhatkal ne bataaya he ki usne kis tarah behad aasaani se bam rakhane jaise khatarnaak kaam ko anjaam diya
 17 people were killed in the German Bakery bombings

 Yasin reached Pune as a student in January 2010
 ek hafte tak shahar kaa survey karne ke baad usne dhamaake ke liye do jagah chunin, mashhoor dagaduu halwai seth mandir or german bekri
 The blasts in both places could catch the attention of the whole world
 yaccin kaa plan osho ashram ke paas bhi dhamaakaa karne kaa tha, kyonki vahaan bhi kaaphi sankhya main videshi aate rahete hai
 Read: Bhatkal said - Go ahead, people of India
 i said there is a bomb in the bag and they started laughing
 Yasin showed his fellow terrorist Katil Siddiqui the location of the temple and bakery and sent the temple to 'rehearsal' the blast
 katil ne maathe par tikaa lagaakar mandir kii parikrama bhi kii
 On the fixed day of the blast, he himself went to the German Bakery by instructing Katil to place the bomb
 poochtacha main yaccin ne bataaya he, 'maine shared auto liya
 a man sitting in the auto asked about the bag
 maine usase kaha ki bam he or phir sab hansane lage
 'read: Yasin wanted to become the chief of IM
 Bhatkalpulis had also arrived
 The bakeryman got down 200 meters before the bakery and started walking towards the bakery
 usne bataaya he, 'maine ek appal pai or cold coffee order kii
 During this time the policemen also came and asked to close the bakery early as Shiv Sena people were protesting against Shahrukh's film 'my Name is Khan' that day

 vivaadaaspad australian ampire darryl harper ne bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni par westeindies ke khilaaf pehle test ke dauraan unhen dhamkaane kii koshish karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 His poor umpiring was criticized by the Indians in the first Test
 bhartiya khilaadiyon kii aalochana ke baad harper ne tisare test se hatane kaa faisla kiya tha
 He said that Dhoni should have been punished for commenting on bad umpiring
 saath hi harper ne kaha ki unhone isisi dwaara dhoni ke khilaaf koi bhi karrwai nahin karne ke kaaran apni chuppi todane ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 Harper said that Dhoni tried to intimidate him when fast bowler Praveen Kumar was dropped from bowling due to running on the pitch continuously
 crickinfo ke anusaar harper ne kaha ki dhoni unke paas aaye or kaha ki darryl hamen pehle bhi tumse pareshaani ho chuki he jise is ampire ne dhamkaane kaa prayaas karne ke taur par liya he
 Harper said, "I later thought what he meant was that i was an umpire that no player or team or board could impress
" vah bhi mujhe daraa nahin sakaa tha
 Harper also said that Dhoni should have been punished for the remarks made in the post-match conference
 dhoni ne kaha tha, agar match main sahi faisle liye gaye hote to match pehle hi khatm ho gaya hota or main ab tak hotel main pahunch gaya hota
 Harper said, it is my opinion that he should have been punished
 uski tippaniyan anuchit thim
 i think this comment was definitely inappropriate
 isisi ke cricket mahaprabandhak david richardsan ne bhi dhoni dwaara kii gai aalochana ko anuchit qaraar kiya tha lekin na hi unhone or na hi match referi jeff kro ne bhartiya captain par aachaar samhita ke ullaghann kaa aarope lagaaya
 Harper lambasted the ICC as she could not do so under pressure from the players and media of India and due to this she had to retire a match in the Caribbean series in advance
 unhone kaha, main isisi prabandhan se kaaphi niraash hum, jisane aisa hone diya
 John Abraham not part of Aamir Khan's Sarfarosh sequel
 nirdeshak jon mathew mathan ne kii pushti
 Often such stories are heard in Bollywood when the actor has to leave the film due to differences between the director and the actor
 aisi hi ek khabar ek baar phir se saamne ai he
 John Abraham has pulled his hand back from the sequel of Aamir Khan's film Sarfarosh
 jon ke film se baahar nikalne kii baat kii pushti karte hue film nirdeshak jon mathew ne bataaya kii jon abraham or unke bich chijen thik tarah se baith nahin paa rahi thim
 John Abraham was an actor in the film as well as a co-producer
 bataa den ki pichley saal hi jon abraham ne is film ke liye hami bhari thi
 In an interview to PTI, John said, "john Matthews and i are co-producing the film
 hamaara scrypting par kaam abhi bhi jari he
 The shooting of the film will start by next year
 jon ne aage ye bhi bataaya ki, sarfarosh dekhne ke baad jon mathew mathan iklaute aise nirdeshak hai jinke ghar ja kar jon ne unhen film ke nirdesan liye saraahte hue kaha tha 'yaar kya film he'
 According to a conversation with mid-day, director John Matthew Maithon's statement shocked everyone
 unhone kaha ki 'maine kabhi pushti nahin kii thi ki jon meri film kar rahe hai, or naa hi maine abhi tak kisi anya abhinayta ke naam kaa media main ullekh kiya he
 Further director John Mathew also said that he did not know what John Abraham said
 diarector jon mathew ne bataaya ki unke or jon abraham ke bich film ko lekar baatcheet zarur chal rahi thi par ye baatcheet kisi nishkarsh par nahin pahunch saki
 Currently, director Matthew is busy in finishing the scripting
 diarector mathew ke kahe mutabik, jab tak ve kisi ko sin nahin kar lete tab tak casting par tippanee nahin karenge
 According to a report, for the last 7 months there was an ongoing discussion between John and director Matthew about the scripting of the film but no success could be achieved
 jon abraham ke pravaktaa ne bhi pushti karte hue kaha he ki, "ham sarfarosh 2 ke liye jon mathan ke saath charchaa main the
 But nothing worked out
 ham is pariyojna ke liye shubhakamanaayen dete hai "
 For the time being, John Abraham has started preparing for the rest of his films
 vah abhi anis bajmi kii film 'paagalpanti' kii shooting kar rahe hai
 Also John is busy with the film Batla House
 pichley saal jon ne film ke liye lakhanu or jamiya nagar, dilli main shooting kii thi
 The story of Batla House is allegedly based on the character of DCP Sanjeev Kumar Yadav, who carried out the Batla House encounter during an encounter between police officers and members of the terrorist group, Indian Mujahideen, in Delhi
 film 15 agast, 2019 ko release hone vaali he
 From July, he will start working on the untitled drama of Rensil de Silva, the story of which revolves around bike racing

 uparokt pankti main unhone hai grahamantri rajnath singh or ye kya he main ye he lav jihad
 When, on 12 September, 24 hours before the election in Uttar Pradesh, the correspondent in Delhi asked the Home Minister that the National self-service Association's mouthpiece Panchjanya had published a full story on it
 puure desh main iske upar ek muhim chal rahi he, aap aisa nahin maanate
 So in response to this Rajnath Singh said what is this
 jabaki bijepi, vishwa hindu parishad or sangh kii taraf se lav jihad ko lekar na sirf mudda banaaya gaya, balki iske paksh main vishwasaneey se lagane vaale anadhikrut or swayansiddh aankaden bhi die gaye
 So did Rajnath Singh foresee 24 hours before the vote that the strategy of seeking votes by spreading hatred has failed
 aakhir bijepi ne rajnath singh, wike singh, uma bharti jaise bade mantriyon ke rahete un mahant adityanath ko kyon aage kiya, jo loksabhaa chunaavon tak apane kshetra tak hi simit rahe
 On 13 August when communal violence was debated in the Lok Sabha on the demand of Congress, BJP first introduced Mahant Adityanath to answer it
 vah bhaashan kaaphi aakraamak tha
 The BJP placed the three people on the election campaign committee for UP
 calraj mishra, lakshminarayan mishra or mahant adityanath
 Mahant Adityanath was placed in the list of star campaigners
 abhiyaan ko aakraamak banane ke liye lav jihad kaa jumala uthaaya gaya or mathura kaaryakarini main is par bhaashan bhi hua magar prastaav kaa hissaa nahin ban sakaa
 Mahant Adityanath Love continued to speak on Jihad
 chunaav ayog ne adityanath ke khilaaf noida main dharmik bhaavana bhadkaa kar vot maangane ke aarope main exiaar darj karne kaa aadesh diya
 BJP did not stop here
 adityanath ke saath-saath unnav ke saansad sakshi maharaj ko utaara, jo madrason ko yah kahkar target karne lage ki vahaan pandrah agast ke din tirangaa nahin fahraate hai
 So many people put such pictures on social media that see the children are hoisting the tricolor in the madrasa
 6 or 7 sitambar ke akhabaaron ko dekh lijie
 Sakshi Maharaj, who came to the field as a Lodh leader, started saying that there is a conspiracy of love jihad in madrasas, he rate it that if there is a Sardar's girl then 9 lakhs, if it is a Jain girl, 8 lakhs and if a Hindu Seven lakh rupees will be given to the girl, to marry her by falling in love
 ye paisa arab deshon se aa rahaa he
 There is no evidence of these things, but the poison has been spread through whatsapp and social media that this is happening
 shaayad grahamantri rajnath singh is sachai ko behatar jaanate honge jo unke jawaab main bhi jhalka ki lav jihad kya he
 But why did Rajnath Singh not stop it in time? Somewhere, he was not going to allow it to continue without being unknown
 kya yah up−janadesh lav jihad arthath nafatar kii raajnneeti ke khilaaf he
 If not, what are the reasons on which the bjp's poor performance is understood
 jis uttar pradesh main chaar maheene pehle bijepi ne loksabhaa kii 73 siten jiti hon, vahaan vah vidhansabha kii apni hi 11 main se 8 siten haar jaae or 3 par hi santosh karnaa pade
 One of these seats is in Varanasi, the constituency of Rohania Prime Minister, where BJP lost by 7805 votes
 rohnia se hi narendra modi ne banaras main chunavi prachaar kii shuruyaat kii thi
 There Anupriya Patel's mother is defeated
 charkhaari jise uma bharti ne khaali kii he, vahaan bijepi tisare number hai or 50,805 voton se haari he
 The issue of Muslim appeasement to law and order was made against the SP government, but the Samajwadi Party won 8 seats and also defeated the BJP in the Mainpuri Lok Sabha by-election
 isi ke saath loksabhaa main sapa parivaar ke 5 sadsy ho gaye
 Familyism also went on
 vahiin saharanpur, lakhanu purv or noida main bijepi kii jeet kaa antar 18 hazaar se lekar 50 hazaar tak he
 Yogi Adityanath has now become Mahant Adityanath and the BJP, which became the Mahant four months ago in UP, has come down a bit
 lav jihad ke naam par bijepi janata kaa lav nahin paa saki
 There is also a news from West Bengal in this short story of bjp's defeat
 pandrah saal baad vahaan bijepi kaa koi vidhayak bana he
 The BJP won the Basirhat Dakshin seat by 1500 votes
 chaurangi seat par trinmul jiti he, magar sipiem ko ek bhi seat nahin mili he
 The special thing is that before bjp's Badal Bhattacharya was elected MLA from Ashoknagar assembly seat in 1999, that too when BJP and Trinamool contested together
 lekin gujarat main congress ne uske kabje se teen siten jeet lee hai or rajasthan main chaar main se teen siten lekar sachin payalat ne vasundhara ke saamne apni vaapasi kii he
 After losing three seats to the Congress in Uttarakhand and 6 to the Congress RJD and JDU alliance in Bihar, it felt that UP would get the answer
 isliye upi main bijepi ne puraa jor lagaaya
 Why did this happen? Amit Shah was made the president of the party so that there was better coordination between the government and the party
 in sabake bich jandhan yojana, japan kii kaamyaab yatra, kaashi ko kioto banane kaa qaraar, shikshak diwas kaa vivaadaaspad master stroke, jidipi kaa sudharna, sensex kaa uchhalana sab kuch to acha ho hi rahaa tha
 Yet why did BJP not have good days in these by-elections? How did Akhilesh Yadav and Sachin come to the pilot? khaas lamhaa :bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar bananaamodi kii lahar-unke fasebuk pej par har hafte 2 karod log conect karte hai
 Not only this, his favorite dress has been named Modi Kurta
 -desh bhar main hui unki reliyon main 60 lakh log shirkat kar chuke hai
 If there is one person who changed the course of politics in 2013, it is Narendra Damodar Das Modi, 63 years
 bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar or 2014 ke chunaav main uske mukhya prachaarak ke rup main modi ne duniya ke sabase mukhar loktantr kii soch par puri tarah chaa jane ke alaava bhi kaaphi kuch kiya he
 This person has become both a messenger and a messenger
 desh main nai chetana jaagrit karne kii modi kii pukaar ne un logon ko zankrut kiya he, jo dilli main baithe vartmaan shaskaon ke haathon chalaa hua mahasoos kar rahe hai
 His call for development has given hope to those who are disappointed with the stagnant economy
 sandeshvahak bhi utana hi haaavee he
 Modi has risen above his party and is acting like a rock star
 ve janata ke dimag se jabardast dhang se khel rahe hai
 His charisma, his combativeness, his resentment and his achievements as an administrator, match his ambition
 modi kaa rasta itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 He first had to crush opposition within the party to be declared chairman of the party's campaign committee in June
 varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ne virodh main kaaryakarini kaa bahishkaar kiya
 Nevertheless, the party president Rajnath Singh had to bow to the pressure of the workers
 jab modi ko sitambar main vidhansabha chunaav se pehle hi pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya gaya to halaat badal chuke the or adwani virodh bhi nahin kar paae
 Modi is now trying to win opponents outside the party, whether they are Muslims or those who consider him a divided leader
 ve chaay bechney ke apane dinon kii yaad dilaakar garibon kaa dil jeetne main lage hai
 Modi's influence is evident from the increasing support on social media
 inamen aam taur par aresas or bijepi samarthak dakshinpanthi sibar hindu hi nahin hai, balki modi ke aise nae samarthak bhi hai, jinhen lagata he ki unke paas har samasya kaa samaadhaan he or ve kuch galat nahin kar sakate
 The storm that Modi created and the widespread opposition to the UPA was evidenced in the assembly elections, when the BJP won Rajasthan by an overwhelming majority and formed the government for the third time in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh
 teenon vijeta mukhyamantriyon ne mana ki unke rajyon main modi ke prachaar se badhat mili
 Whether or not Modi becomes Prime Minister in the summer of 2014, he has changed the course of Indian politics
 ve akasar bolte hai, jor se bolte hai or apane se asahmat logon ko bhi apni baat sunne par majaboor kar dete hai
 At the Kanpur rally on October 29, Modi had said that the country of 125 crores can achieve whatever it wants on the strength of the world's youngest population
 jarurat he sirf hasil karne ke liye majboot iraade kii
 Modi is so ingrained that he recognizes his shortcomings and is therefore beginning to understand the nuances of foreign policy and national security
 ve lagaataar sonia gandhi or 'shahjada’ rahul kaa makhul udaakar congress ke pehle parivaar par hamalaa bol rahe hai
 But many people are starting to believe that every now and then they should talk more about solutions rather than just whipping the Congress
 2013 main congress virdohi lahar ne modi kii takat badhaai
 The 2014 war will be the most important battle in Modi's life

 The decline in exports of commercial goods and services has led to a rise in exports to India after a good boom between 2010-11 and 2011-12
 haal ke varshon main niryaat main sevaaon kaa hissaa badha he
 a few years ago, services accounted for about 32 per cent of the total exports, but now it has been more than 38 per cent

 According to global data released by UNCTAD, exports of Indian goods are growing under a common trend, which suggests that it has a deep engagement with the global economy

 The time of independence in global exports is also not achieved! India has not been able to increase its share in global exports to 2 percent even in the post-independence period

 According to Professor Nag, China's exports have increased because it has given a big boost to an industry in which the export potential is high
 china ne esaijed or anya sambandhit buniyadi dhaanche jaise bandargahon, logistic or single windo cliirang system aadi ke vikaas par jor diya he
 In addition, China has adopted a long-term strategy to make its workers efficient, enabling them to compete with cheaper wage countries like Vietnam and Indonesia, but India has not been able to do anything

 Similar figures are also of gemstone-jewelry and readymade garments

 According to Professor Nag, the export of gems and jewelery has been adversely affected due to rising import costs
 iske alaava vaishvik mandi se bhi aise lagjri utpaadon kii khapat par asar padaa he
 Similarly, there are several reasons for the decline in exports of readymade garments, such as dependence on import of raw materials, increased delivery time and tough competition from cheap labor in countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka

 According to him, India's exports are lagging behind for three reasons
 pehla, bhartiya niryaatkon ke liye karj bahut mahangaa he
 Indian exporters get loans at an interest rate of 6 to 7 per cent, while in China and Vietnam the interest rate is almost zero
 MSME ko niryaat par 5 fisadi tak kii byaaj sabsidi milti he, jise badhaakar sabhi niryaatkon ke liye karne kii jarurat he

 ' aapako bataa den ki gautam gambhir is samay purvi dilli se saansad hai
 You must have heard 'bin pani sub-tsun', but this time it seems that Delhiites will have to consider Purvanchal's Mahaparva Chhath without water
 ye isliye kah rahe hai kyonki dilli ke chhath ghaaton kaa haal kuch khaas nahin he
 The holy water which is most needed for Chhath Puja, this year, Vratis will have to fight hard for the same holy water
 24 oktober ko nahaay khaay ke saath hi purvanchal kaa mahaparv chhath shuru ho rahaa he
 But if we talk about the preparations going on in the ghats of the Delhi government, then most of the ghats of Delhi do not appear ready for the Maha Parva of Chhath Puja

 The committee complains that the water level in Yamuna is also very low and cleanliness has not been done properly

 Actually, Wazirabad Ghat is a major ghat for the residents across the Yamuna, but in the name of preparations, this ghat may have tried to prepare the ghat, the stage and pandals are being decorated, but the Yamuna river in which thousands of devotees are given Chhath Puja To offer arghya to the Sun God
 usee yamuna main pani kaa str ghutanon se bhi kam he
 While it is believed that while giving argya to the Sun God, the fast is to be submerged in water from the waist up
 samasya sirf pani ke str ko lekar nahin he balki samasya pani kii gunvattta ko lekar bhi he
 There are mosses along the banks of the ghat, causing the risk of slipping of vowels
 chhath samiti ke logon ke mutabik har saal chhath puja ke 2-3 din pehle se hi yamuna main pani chhod diya jaataa tha
 Due to which the dirt of the ghat was washed away with the flow of water and the water quality also improved
 lekin is saal ab tak yamuna main pani nahin choda gaya he jisase chhath samiti chintit he
 Let us tell you that last time 268 Ghats Parachhat Puja was organized inside Delhi, whereas this time Chhath Puja is being organized at 564 Ghats

 The deal between the companies of Venugopal Dhoot and Deepak Kochhar in the case of loaning nearly 4 thousand crores to Videocon group, loan by foreign branch and transfer of money by shell companies is the same as Nirav Modi and Mehul in PNB scam
 Choksi did it
 is maamle main kai mahatvapurn sawaalon kaa jawaab milanaa baaki he
 According to information given to Tikadamaristrar of Companies, which baffled the transfer of shares, Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot, husband of ICICI Bank chief Chanda Kochhar, formed a joint venture Nupower Renewables Private Limited (NRPL) in December 2008
 is company main dhoot parivaar kii 50 fisadi saajhedaari thi or baaki share deepak kochar or unke parivaar ke swaamitv vaale pacific capital ke the
 a year later, in January 2009, Dhoot resigned as director of NRPL and transferred about 25,000 of his shares to Deepak Kochhar
 iske alaava march 2010 main dhoot ke swaamitv vaali ek company supreme energy privet limited ne NRPL ko 64 karod rupee kaa secord lone diya
 But then by March 2010 Supreme Energy took over majority ownership of NRPL and Deepak Kochhar left only 5% ownership
 khel yaheen khatm nahin hota, iske kareeb aath maheene baad dhoot ne supreme energy kii apni puri hissedari apane ek sahyogi mahesh chandra pangalia ko transfar kar di
 Then about two years later, Panglia transferred his entire stake in the company to Deepak Kochhar's company Pinnacle Energy for just Rs 9 lakh
 in sawaalon ke jawaab milane bakidhut or deepak kochar kii kaarobaari saajhedaari or ek duubati company ko ICICI dwaara die gaye karj ko lekar kai gambhir sawaal khadey hote hai
 Videocon investor Arvind Gupta, who has complained in the matter, told India Today, "we want to know why Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot formed a joint venture and why Dhoot got out of it
" ham yah jaananaa chaahate hai ki morishas kii company d rinuables ke peeche asal main koun log hai
 The reason for Gupta's suspicion is that NRPL will get foreign fund in abundance at the time when ICICI Bank gave loans to Dhoot's company
 bank ne videocone group ko kareeb 4000 karod rupye ke lone 2010 se 2012 ke bich die or d rinuables ne isi daur main 325 karod or 66 karod rupye NRPL main daale
 When ICICI Bank was giving loan to Videocon Group, why was so much money coming from outside in Deepak Kochhar's company? Loans were given immediately, a shell company of Cayman Islands (probably associated with Videocon Group) was given a loan of Rs 660 crore
 deepak kochar or dhoot aniyamitata se chaahe jitna inkaar karen, lekin kai sawaalon ke jawaab nahin mil paae hai
 What did Videocon guarantee ICICI against the loan? What was the company's credit score when the bank approved the loan? And the most important question is whether Chanda Kochhar had informed the bank board about Dhoot's business relationship with her husband? Videocon Group acquired these loans from icici's Canada and UK branches in the accounts of its five subsidiary companies
 chanda kochar ICICI bank canada or euke kii vaais cheirperson hai
 Between 2010 and 2012, Nupower Renewables secured funding of Rs 325 crore (which is 10 per cent of 3250 crore) from Firsthand Holding, a Mauritius company, which was later changed to DH Renewables Holdings, a company based in Mauritius
 saal 2014 main morishas kii d rinuables holdings ne phir noopower ko 66 karod rupee die (jo 660 karod rupee kaa 10 fisadi hota he)
 It is believed that DH Renewables Holdings is the shell company of Venugopal Dhoot

 ek naaballigh ke saath balaatkaar karne vaale aaropee ko bachaane ke liye rajdhani dilli ke sab-inspector ne chaar lakh rupye kii rishwat maangi
 The CBI has been arrested red handed by the Sub Inspector who deals with the honor of this minor
 ye aarope yon utpeedan or balaatkaar ke maamle main mahilaon or ladakiyon kii ore dilli police kii samvedansheeltaa par bhi sawaal uthaate hai
 According to the CBI, Deepak Kumar, a sub-inspector posted at Delhi's Khajuri police station, demanded a bribe of Rs 4 lakh to rescue the accused Chirag Agarwal, who has been arrested for raping a minor girl
 aaropee chiraag agarwal ke pita deepak tomars ne up-nireekshak deepak kumaar dwaara rishwat kii maang ke baad, sibiai se sampark kiya or ek likhit shikaayat di, jisamen se ek prati 'aaj tak' ke paas uplabdh he
 In the complaint, the father of the accused has alleged that, "on April 22, my son Chirag Agarwal was picked up by the police and a case was registered against him under the rape and POCSO Act
 jab ham sab-inspector deepak kumaar se mili, to unhone mere bete ko bachaane ke liye 4 lakh rupee kii maang kii or kaha ki balaatkaar or POCSO adhinium ke aaropon ko hataa diya jayega

 As per the plan, a CBI team along with the complainant arrived inside the court in the afternoon on 26 April where the sub-inspector allegedly accepted the bribe
 ek baar phir tomars ko aashwaasan diya ki unke bete ke khilaaf lage aarope hataa die jaaenge
 Deepak Kumar immediately asked Tomar to arrange 1 lakh and meet him at the police station

 The government has recently taken the merger of MTNL and BSNL, due to the decision-making and private sector competition
 Has decided to merge Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL)
 haalanki yah kadam aise samay main uthaaya gaya he, jab pani sir se upar guzar chukaa he
 It may give some competition to private companies and they will have to reduce the call rate or package, but how long will the new government company formed after the merger last? How well will both the companies and its employees benefit? It is still in the future
 bahut der kar dijankaron kaa kahana he ki yah kaam kaaphi pehle hona chahie tha
 Both companies are incurring considerable losses on the operational cost front
 donon companiyon ke vilay or prastaavit svaichhik sevanivritti yojana (VRS) ke package se is laagat par kuch ankush lagaaya ja saktaa he
 But this competition will not be enough to make this company stand again in the competition
 sarkaar ne buudhvaar ko emtnael or beasenel ke vilay ke saath inke punuruddhar ke jis package kaa elaan kiya he, isamen sovrain bond se 15,000 karod rupee jutaney kii yojana bhi he
 Apart from this, about 38,000 crore rupees will be saved in the next four years from the sale of their real estate such as assets and VRS
 beasenel ke paas kareeb 70,746 karod rupee kii parisampatti he
 Once in the telecom world, BSNL was a Navratna public company and MTNL also had a monopoly on the telecom service in two metro cities
 lekin ab isko 90,000 karod rupee se zyada kaa ghaataa ho chukaa he
 The sluggish state-run company BSNL could not stand up to competent private players like Reliance Jio and Airtel
 ab kareeb 1,76,000 karmchaariyon vaali beasenal safed hathi hi sabit hui or nijee companiyon ke saamne iskaa tikna mushkil tha
 BSNL was formed on October 1, 2000 and is providing telecom services and network management services across the country, apart from metro cities
 yah desh main telecom seva dene vaali sabase puraani company he
 Many experts say that there was a time that in the year 2007-08, the government could get out of the telecom business by selling BSNL for a huge amount of about 7 lakh crores, but today the condition is that the relief package to the government for BSNL Have to give
 kyon hua bantaadharasal main beasenel or emtnael kaa pehle desh main sanchaar jagat main ekadhikaar rahaa he or isaki vajah se iske karmchaariyon kaa mindset isi tarah se kaam karne kaa bana hua he, jabaki telecom jagat main ab maahaul galakat pratispardhaa vaala ho gaya he or jeeyo ne to airtel, vodaphone jaise nijee kshetra ke diggajon ko hilaakar rakh diya he, aise main ye piesu kahaan tikne vaale hai
 In the next five years after the postponement of the IPO, political intervention, failure to change over time, governmental dysfunctional system has made the condition of a strong telecom company so bad that it had to seek a relief package
 telecom kii duniya main jis tarah kii pratispardhaa he use dekhte hue vahi company tik paa rahi he jiskaa network apgrade he
 Due to the good network, Jio has captured many customers from other companies
 saal 2006-07 main beasenel kii kul aay kareeb 40,000 karod rupee thi or shuddh munafa 8,000 karod rupee tha
 The company was in trouble since 2007-08 and it incurred losses in the next few years
 vitt varsh 2012 main company ko 9,000 karod rupee kaa nuksaan hua
 The company's revenue also fell to less than Rs 28,000 crore, 30 per cent less than in 2006-07
 yahi nahin, paanch saal pehle beasenel kii aamadani kaa 23 fisadi hissaa karmchaariyon ke vetan par diya ja rahaa tha, lekin ab yah badhkar 48 fisadi tak ho chukaa he
 The company had to invest a major chunk of cash in bsnl's purchase of 3G and broadband wireless spectrum
 kuprabandhan, nitigat deree or sarkari dakhal kaa ek yah ek behtareen udhaaharan he
 bsnl's market share reduced to just 11
 5 fisadi rah gai he or mobile sabsakribar ke hisaab se yah paanchaven sthaan par pahunch gaya he
 The company could not expand its capacity due to increasing demand
 yah bhi aarope lagaae jate hai ki nijee companiyon ne apane raajnneetik rasookh kaa istemaal kar aisi nitiyaan banavaain jisase beasenel ko baari nuksaan hua
 The most prominent example of this was the late arrival of 4G technology
 technology apgrade karne main company kii naakaami kii vajah se use phaayde main rahane or apane oonche ARPU (ausat revenue prati yujar) ko banaae rakhane main kaaphi mushkil hui
 Due to fierce competition and the entry of Jio in free voice as well as the cost of data being cheaper, many small telecom companies in India's telecom sector closed down and merged with Jio, Airtel in the current era
 Vodafone and Idea are left
 emtnael kaa gathan 1 april, 1986 ko hua tha, jab sarkaar desh ke do pramukh metro shaharon dilli or mumbai main telecom network kaa vistaar kar nai sevaayen shuru karne or revenue hasil karne kii soch lekar ai thi
 MTNL also does business in Nepal through joint venture United Telecom Limited (UTL)
 iske alaava, company 100 fisadi sabsidiari ke saath mahanagar telephone morishas limited (MTML) ke naam se morishas main bhi kaarobaar kar rahi he
 Till 1992, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) had a monopoly in telecom services in Mumbai and New Delhi
 emtnael kii badahaali kii vajahen bhi vahi thim, jo beasenel kii
 The government missed the opportunity! When BSNL and MTNL were at their peak, the government had the opportunity to try to increase its efficiency by selling some stake, but the then government failed to do so
 saal 2007-08 ke pichley share bazaar main boom ke daur main jab beasenel ke ipo laane kii taiyaari ho rahi thi, tab iskaa vailuation kareeb 100 arab dollar (aaj ke hisaab se kareeb 7 lakh karod rupee) aanka ja rahaa tha
 Vodafone had then bought the then-brokerage company Hutch Essar and the valuation of Hutch Essar was just $ 21 billion, which means bsnl's valuation was 5 to 6 times more than this
 haalanki kai vajahon se ipo ko taalna pad gaya
 What is the government's plan? Now, with the merger of MTNL and BSNL, the government is planning to allocate spectrum for 4G services, restructuring debt, reducing employee costs through VRS and raising funds by selling assets
 centre sarkaar ne bharat sanchaar nigam limited (beasenel) or mahanagar telephone nigam limited (emtnael) main nai jaan foonkane ke liye buudhvaar ko unke vilay ko hari jhandi dete hue unhen sovrain band ke madhyam se 1,5000 karod rupee jutaney kii anumati pradaan kii
 Also, these public sector companies will be allocated 4G spectrum at the 2016 price
 ukt spectrum ke liye financing bharat sarkaar dwaara in piesu main 20,140 karod rupee mulya kii puunji daalkar kii jaaegi, iske alaava is spactrum mulya ke liye jiesti ke taur par 3,674 karod rupee kii raashi kaa vahan bhi bharat sarkaar dwaara bajtiy sansadhano ke madhyam se kiya jayega
 Using this spectrum allocation, BSNL and MTNL will be able to provide 4G services, compete in the market and provide high speed data across the country including rural areas using its vast network
 lekin yah yojana abhi sirf kaagajon par acchhee lag rahi he
 The government's move is also seen with skepticism given the long history of red tape, inaction and inability to implement schemes
 kya band karnaa he vikalp?4ji sevaaon ke launch ke kareeb paanch saal baad sarkaarko yah abhas hua ki beasenel or emtnael ko bhi isaki jarurat he
 Now that the 5G era is coming in the country, BSNL and MTNL are not able to adopt 4G also
 isliye vah nijee companiyon ko kitni pratispardhaa de paaengi, isko lekar andeh hi he
 Many experts are even saying that the government is giving the employees a way to exit in a respectful manner and most of its work will eventually be stopped
 beasenal or emtnael, donon ke liye bade paimaane par maujuud karmchaaree ek badi samasya hai, kyonki donon main jarurat se zyada karmchaaree hai
 In BSNL, the share of employees' salary has gone up to 75% of the total income, while in private companies it is just 3 to 5%
 kisi jamaane main beasenel main 4 lakh karmchaaree hua karte the, jo ab ghatakar mahaj 1
 76 lakhs
 kai jaankaar to aisa maan rahaa he ki beasenel or emtnael ko bachaane kii sarkari kavayad paise kii barbaadi hi sabit hogi
 Many experts are supporting the shutdown of these two companies, for which the government has to pay a total of 1
 2 lakh karod rupee kharch kar (VRS or anya chizon ke liye) chhutkaaraa paa lenaa hoga
 But if the government has taken some steps, then it must have been done with much thought
 kul milakar kahen to beasenal-emtnael sarkaar ke gale kii haddi ban chuke hai
 Therefore, it can be prayed now that BSNL and MTNL come out of this coma

 '' rane samiti ne sifarish kii thi ki maraathon ko shiksha or sarkari naukariyon main 16 fisadi aarakshan diya jaae
 In July 2014, the then congress-ncp government had implemented a reservation policy in this regard, but in the same November the Bombay High Court stayed it
 court kaa kahana tha ki maratha saamaajik rup se unnat or pratishthit samudaay he, use aarakshan kii koi darkaar nahin he
 bjp's Devendra Fadnavis had assumed power as the Chief Minister in the state at that time
 maratha aarakshan kaa mudda tab unka sirdard ban gaya
 The court based its report on the three commissions reported between 1990 and 2008
 inamen kaha gaya tha ki marathaon ko pichhadaa nahin mana ja saktaa
 In December 2014, the Fadnavis government also passed a bill for reservation for Maratha people but in April 2015, the High Court again stayed it on the ground that the state government did not reserve more than the 50 percent reservation limit prescribed by the Supreme Court
 Can give

 Petitions are currently being heard in the matter and the High Court has given the state government one last chance to gather data
 maratha samudaay ke kai logon ko mukhyamantri ke iraadon par bhi andeh he
 Some people even allege that Fadnavis is a Brahmin, hence showing his caste-based discrimination
 rane kaa kahana he ki samvidhan sanshodhan karke maharashtra ko 50 fisadi aarakshan kii seemaa ko paar karne kii ijaajat deni chahie
 They ask, "when there can be 68 per cent reservation in Tamil Nadu, why not Maharashtra?" The answer lies in the political will, for them
 "the High Court stayed the order because the government gave my committee 'S findings were not put before the court
 sarkaar darasal maraathon ke liye aarakshan chaahati hi nahin he
 However, state Higher Education Minister Vinod Tawde, who headed the Maratha Reservation Committee, says that Rane should blame (his own) the then congress-ncp government for not putting the recommendations before the court
 taavade ne jor dekar kaha, ''hamaari sarkaar is baat ko sabit karne kii bharsak koshish kar rahi he ki maratha saamaajik va aarthik rup se pichde hai
 "but leaders like Tawde and Rane have now proved to be dwarfs in the face of the strength of Maratha community protests

 Presently, under this law, for offenses such as Chhedkhani, the accused have to go to the High Court to seek bail
 is prakriya main aksar do maheene tak lag jate hai
 The state government wants that the bail hearing be held in the district court so that the process can be resolved quickly and for light level offenses, the government suggests that the bail action be completed within a week

 The anger against the oppressive law or the leaders of the upper castes cannot hide the distress that the Maratha people have against their own leaders

 The story of the film revolves around criminal Chilampahalwan Damru Babake

 According to the film's director Manoj Tiwari, there is a great demand for original stories in the film industry at the present time

 The film's producer Vijay Bansal believes that by watching the film, the audience will feel that these incidents are connected to his life somewhere
 surat ke ek santhaan ne raging ke khilaaf kadaa ruukh apanaate hue chah chaatro ko ek saal ke liye nilambit kar diya or 28 anya ko dandit kiya he
 Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology has taken action against second and third year students based on the recommendation of its anti-ragging committee
 is hafte ke shuru main pratham varsh ke kareeb 15 chaatro ne apane varishton ke khilaaf raging kii shikaayat adhikariyon ke paas kii thi or isaki jaanch raging virdohi samiti ne kii thi
 So why was Aarushi and Hemraj killed? What happened inside the house that night that a doctor colored his hands with two or two blood? What was that voice, Doctor Talwar became uncontrollable upon hearing it
 or koun sa manzar tha jise dekhte hi wo apane hosh kho baithe
 Here is the full story of the last six hours of that night from 15-16 May 2008
 aarushi mar chuki thi lekin hemraj kii saansen ab bhi chal rahi thim
 In such a situation, the Talwar couple felt that if Hemraj remained the real responsible for Aarushi's death, then their secret would be revealed
 lihaaza, ab unhone jo faisalaa kiya wo soch-samaj kar liya tha
 Angry doctors had attacked Talwar Aarushi and Hemraj
 par jab unhen ahsaas hua ki aarushi mar chuki he tab donon pehali baar ghabaraae
 The reason for the panic was also that Hemraj was still unconscious but alive
 or wo sabko sari kahani bataa saktaa tha
 So for the first time, Doctor Talwar and Nupur Talwar decided that now Hemraj should be killed so that there is no evidence left
 unhone hemraj ko maarane ke baad uski laash ko chupaane or phir mauka milte hi kahin le jaakar thikaane laga dane kii bhi yojana bana lee thi
 Under this plan, Doctor Talwar and Nupur Talwar wrapped Hemraj in a sheet and then dragged Hemraj unconscious and took him to the roof via a ladder
 chat par le jane ke baad doctor talwaar ne sargical blade se hemraj kaa galaa kaat diya
 After this, when he was convinced of his death, he put a panel of cooler on the roof on Hemraj's body so that no one could see it
 iske baad jis chadar main laash upar le gaye the wo chadar or hathiyaar lekar waapas neeche aae
 Then picked up the sheet of double bed from Aarushi's room and went back upstairs with the lock-key of the roof
 iske baad chadar ko do chhaton ke bich ke khaali hisse main chupa diya
 Then locked the roof door and came back to Aarushi's room
 ab aarushi ke kamare kii safai kii baari thi
 But before this, Dr
 Talwar had cut Murda Aarushi's throat with the same surgical blade as Hemraj's throat
 taaki donon ke jakhm ek jaise lagen
 After this he fixed the scattered samam on the bed
 nai chadar bichaai
 After fixing the room, Dr
 Nupur Talwar cleaned Aarushi's body and changed her clothes
 is dauraan donon ne internet ke router se bhi chhedchhad kii
 After cleaning the room, now Doctor Talwar collected his blood-soaked Nupur Talwar clothes, sheets, surgical blades and put him out of the flat late at night
 jabaki golf stick ko dhone ke baad aarushi ke kamare ke saamne kii duchhatti main chupa diya
 After disposing of everything, both of them locked the main gate of the flat from inside
 jabaki bich vaale lohe ke get par baahar kii taraf se taala lagaaya
 After locking, both of them entered the flat through Hemraj's room

 Lalu- Shahabuddin's alleged conversation laloo-helloshabuddin-pranamaloo-yes boloshhabuddin-siwan Take some news of laloo-siwan? i have heard of the incident of Mirganj, the situation is worse in shahabuddin-siwan
 us din maine kaha tha vah 'chhaatawala' kii galati se, aaj navami tha, police kaa depyutesan kiya janaa chahie tha
 Lalu-didn't? Shahabuddin-no no nothing
 
 Your SP is of no use

 Lalu - Has anything happened today? Shahabuddin - Yes, i have come to know that the bullet is also from the police

 Lalu - Where? Shahabuddin - Find out
 lalu-espi ko phone lagaao to
 
 
 After the tapes of this alleged conversation between Lalu and Shahabuddin surfaced, JDU, the ruling coalition partner of Bihar and RJD, is on the defensive and is talking about investigation, while the BJP is a complete attacker
 varisht bijepi netaa susheel modi kehete hai ki lalu kaa pardaafash ho chukaa he
 The central government should intervene immediately in this matter

 ' ICICI Bank frod maamle main arun jetali ke blog lekhan ko baari jhatka laga he
 Finance Minister Jaitley from the US wrote a blog in favor of the accused named in the ICICI Bank and Videocon Bank fraud cases
 apane blog main sibiai kii aalochana kii thi ki bank jagat ke bade logon kaa naam lene se unki pratishtha dhoomil ho jaati he
 It is another matter that he had been transferred to the SP of the CBI conducting FIR before coming to the blog
 ab vitt mantri ke blog lekhan ko jhatka kyon laga he
 The investigation into the fraud that took place in the ICICI Bank and Videocon case was given to retired Justice BN Srikrishna
 jinaki report milte hi bank ke board ne jo faisla kiya he lagata he uski aalochana karne ke liye vitt mantri ko ek or blog likhnaa padegaa
 The audit committee of the bank assigned Justice Srikrishna to investigate
 is report ke aadhaar par bank ke board ne chanda kochar ko nikaal diya he
 The bonus given to Chanda Kochhar, etc
 has been withheld
 unhen ab koi suvidha nahin milegi
 Dues will also not be given
 unhen jo share vagairah mili the ab sab roak liye jaaenge
 Justice Srikrishna in his investigation has found Chanda Kochhar guilty
 bataaya he ki unke kaarykaal main niyamon ko tod kar kai faisle liye gaye or uski jaankaree bank kii salanaa report se chhipaai gai
 Now you think jetali sibiai ko exiaar main bankeron ke naam lene par latad rahe hai magar vahiin isiaisiai kaa board justise shrikrishna kii report par chanda kochar ko nikaal rahaa he
 Obviously, if Chanda Kochhar has broken the rules, then someone else has also benefited from it
 unhone akele faisla to nahin liya hoga
 So, will Finance Minister Jaitley also write a blog to the ICICI Board that the board has fallen victim to investment adventureism
 is par aglaa blog aa jayega tabhi charchaa karenge
 On the other hand, Rahul Gandhi again explained about the Universal Basic Income at Talkatora Stadium today
 unhone do baaten kahin
 One is in favor of this scheme and the other for industrialists
 rahul ne udyogpatiyon se kaha ki congress udyogpatiyon ke khilaaf nahin he
 Rahul took the names of four of the five industrialists, but i think some of those who were not included in the list of crony capitalists
 kya rahul ko sabakaa naam lene main koi dikkat he
 However, listen to his statement as our discussion is on Universal Basic Income
 bajet aane vaala he
 There may be a model of universal basic income in the budget as well, so we thought that for the first time in the 2016-17 Economic Survey, the government document spoke to Arvind Subramanian
 pro arvind subramanyan harvad ke kennedy skool main padhaa rahe hai
 He wrote about it in the Economic Survey, that in an justice-loving society, everyone should be guaranteed a minimum income
 meraa sawaal yahi he ki jab samaaj main insaaf har scale par mushkil ho
 From the court to health, then on what basis does this concept of Prof Subramanian make minimum justice in society 
 kya basic incum saamaajik suraksha skim he yaa phir aarthik sahaayta skim he jiske tahat aapako kuch paise die ja rahe hai
 If you ask anyone if they have faith in the new pension system, economists should tell who has made their pension worth living with the new pension system, then what will happen to their questions

 a shocking incident has emerged from Bharatpur in Rajasthan
 yahaan ek mahila doctor ne ek mahila or uske bete ko aag ke hawaale kar diya
 Both died in the incident
 police ke anusaar aaropee doctor ko shaq tha ki uske pati se duusari mahila kaa avaidh sambandh tha
 Initiation of the police investigation revealed that the accused doctor had first put a spirit in the woman's house, only after that she set the house on fire
 police ke anusaar mritak mahila kii pahchaan deepa gurjar ke rup main kii gai he
 Police has done a postmortem of Deepa and her son and handed over the dead body to her family members
 is maamle main police ne shuukravaar ko teen logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 Police have identified the accused doctor as Seema
 saath hi uske pati sudeep or uski maa ko bhi giraftaar kar liya he
 In this case, Deepa's sister Radha has filed a complaint against the accused
 police ne teenon ko court main pesh kiya tha
 From where two people have been sent to judicial custody
 jabaki tisare aaropee yani sudeep ko police remand main bheja gaya he
 a senior police officer said that Deepa used to work in Sudeep's hospital
 isi dauraan sudeep or deepa ke bich nazdikiyaan badhin
 a police investigation has revealed that Sudeep had also bought Deepa a villa some time back
 deepa apane bete ke saath isi vila main rah rahi thi
 The person's vehicle was parked at Seventeenth Street and Constitution Avenue
 sangheey agenton ko talash ke dauraan vaahan ke nikat se ek anya hathiyaar mila
 There were no casualties in this incident, law enforcement personnel or anyone standing near
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 This is published directly from Syndicate Feed) (NDTV team has not edited this news
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) It is said that if Mahadevratri worships Bhole Baba in any stroke, then Maa Parvati and Bhole Tripurari open their hearts and fulfill the wishes of the devotees
 mahashivaratri par puure man se kiijie shiv kii aradhana or puri kiijie apni har kaamana
 Mahashivratri is a major festival of Hindus
 yah bhagwaan shiv ke pujan kaa sabase bada parv bhi he
 Maha Shivaratri festival is celebrated on Phalgun Krishna Chaturdashi
 mana jaataa he ki sristi ke prarambh main isi din madhyaraatri ko bhagwaan shankar kaa brahma se rudra ke rup main avataran hua tha
 On the day of Pradosh in the Bela of the Holocaust, Lord Shiva Tandava ends the universe with the flame of the third eye, hence it is called Mahashivratri or Kalratri
 vishwaas kiya jaataa he ki teenon lokon kii apaar sundari tathaa shilvati gauri ko ardhangini banane vaale shiv preton or pishaachon se ghire rahete hai
 His appearance is very strange
 sharir par masaanon kii bhasma, gale main sarpon kaa haar, kanth main vish, jataaon main jagat-tarini paavan ganga tathaa maathe main pralayankar jwaala unki pahchaan he
 Shiva, who accepts the bull as a vehicle, kills the devotees even when he is immortal and offers Shree-property
 yah din jeev maatr ke liye mahaan uplabdhi praapt karne kaa din bhi he
 It is said that those who worship this great form on this day are extremely lucky
 iske bare main sant shiromani goswami tulsidas ji ne maryaada purushottam bhagwaan ram ke mukh se kahalwaya he, 'shivadrohi mam das kahava
 So the male dream is Mohi Nahin Bhava
 ' yaan jo shiv kaa droh karke mujhe praapt karnaa chahta he, vah sapane main bhi mujhe praapt nahin kar saktaa
 That is why the Sri Ramcharitmanas text with Shiva worship in Shravan month has great significance
 shiv kii mahatta ko 'shivsagar' main or zyada vistrut rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Sivasagar states that the various powers, Vishnu and Brahma, who are enshrined as Goddesses and Gods, due to which the existence of the world, which are instruments, mantras, salutes Lord Shiva as a Tantra
 dakshin bharat kaa prasiddh granth 'natarajam' bhagwaan shiv ke sampoorn alok ko prastut karata he
 It has been written that Lord Shiva, who preached before Madhumas i
e
 the month of Chaitra, i
e
, the Trayodashi of Falgun month, does not have anything to give
 isamen bataaya gaya he ki 'tripathgamini’ ganga, jinaki jataa main sharan or vishram paati hai, trilok- akaash, pataal va mrityulok vaasiyon ke trikaal yani bhoot, bhavishya va vartmaan ko jinke trinetra trigunatmak banaate hai
 The body of three fire creatures emitted from all the three eyes nourishes the body, whose triangular elements give the world the form, the shape, the type and the disorder, whose trilogy destroys the triloka in a trivial way, such as Lord Shiva in the Trivedi
 May Madhumas Purva Pradoshapra be happy on Trayodashi date
 mahashivaratri se judi kathamhashivaratri ke din shivbhakt bade dhoomdhaam se shiv kii puja karte hai
 Devotees go to temples and offer bell-letters etc
 on the Shivling
 saath hi log upwas tathaa raat ko jaagran karte hai
 Placing bell-letters, fasting and night awakening on the Shivling indicates a special karma
 yah mana jaataa he ki is din shiv kaa vivaah hua tha, isliye raatri main shivaji kii baraat nikaali jaati he
 In fact, the ultimate festival of Shivaratri is a reminder of the divine incarnation of the universe itself
 brahman, kshatriya, vaisya, shudra, stri-purush, balak, yuva or vruddh sabhi is vrath ko kar sakate hai
 In the fast of this fast, after fasting in the morning, a fast is kept
 shivaratri par sachcha upwas yahi he ki ham paramatma shiv se buddhi yoga lagaakar unke sameep rahe
 Fasting means staying close
 jaagran kaa sachcha arth bhi kaam, krodh aadi paanch vikaron ke vasheebhoot hokar agyaan rupi kumbhkaran kii nidra main so jane se swayan ko sadaa bachaae rakhana he
 Jagran has special significance on the festival of Shivaratri
 puranic katha he ki ek baar parvatiji ne bhagwaan shivashankar se poocha, 'aisa koun-sa shreshth tathaa saral vrath-pujan he, jisase mrityulok ke praani aapaki krupa sahaj hi praapt kar lete hai?' uttar main shivaji ne parvati ko 'shivaratri' ke vrath kaa upaay bataaya
 The Lord of Chaturdashi Tithi is Shiva
 at: jyotish shastron main ise param shubhafaladaayi kaha gaya he
 By the way, Shivaratri comes every month
 parantu phalgun krishna chaturdashi ko hi mahashivaratri kaha gaya he
 According to astrological calculations, Sun God has also come in Uttarayan by this time and this time of season change is said to be very auspicious
 shiv kaa arth he kalyaan
 Shiva is the welfare of all
 at: mahashivaratri par saral upaay karne se hi icchit sukh kii prapti hoti he
 According to astrological mathematics, on the Chaturdashi date, the moon reaches its state of attenuation, due to which the weak moons are unable to give energy to the universe
 chandramaa kaa sidhaa sambandh man se kaha gaya he
 Now, when the mind is weak, physical anguish surrounds the creature and a state of depression arises, due to which the sufferings have to be faced
 chandramaa shiv ke mastak par sushobhit he
 Therefore, Lord Shiva is taken to seek the blessings of Chandradev
 ek katha yah bhi bataati he ki mahashivaratri shiv kii priy tithi he, isliye praaia: jyotishi shivaratri ko shiv aradhana kar kashton se mukti paane kaa suzav dete hai
 Shiva is eternal
 sristi ke vinaash or pun:sthaapan ke bich kii kadi hai
 In astrology, Shiva is considered to be the basis of happiness and the importance of performing many types of rituals on Mahashivaratri
 kaise karen mahashivaratri main puja
 
 
 We tell you how Shiva is worshiped on this day
 sabase pehle mitti ke bartan main pani bharkar, upar se belptr, dhatura ke pushp, chaaval aadi daalkar shivlinga par chadhaayein
 Yes, i tell you one more solution, if there is no pagoda in the vicinity of the house, then it can also be worshiped by making Shivling with pure wet soil
 mana jaataa he ki is din shivpurana kaa paath sunanaa chahie
 Awakening at night and listening to the recitation of Shiv Puran is considered the religion of every fast
 iske baad agle din savere jau, til, kheer or belptr kaa havan karke vrath samaapt kiya jaataa he
 This day is believed to be the holiest day of Lord Shankar
 yah apni aatma ko punit karne kaa mahavrath he
 By observing this fast, all sins are destroyed
 hinsak pravriti badal jaati he
 Kindness develops in your mind towards innocent creatures
 mahashivaratri ko din-raat puja kaa vidhaan he
 Shiva's eternal grace is obtained by going to the Shivalayas in four and a half days, offering Jalabhishekam to the Shiva lingam
 saath hi chaar pahar raatri main vedamantra samhita, rudrashta dhyaayi paath brahmanon ke mukh se sunanaa chahie
 Pooja-aarti should be prepared in the northeast before sunrise
 suryoday ke samay pushpanjali or stuti kirthan ke saath mahashiv raatri kaa pujan sampann hota he
 After that, fasting is done by distributing prasad by Brahmabhoja Bhandara during the day
 shastron ke anusaar, shiv ko mahadev isliye kaha gaya he ki ve devtaa, daitya, manushya, naag, kinnar, gandharva pashu-pakshi va samast vanaspati jagat ke bhi swami hai
 Shiva also means welfare
 shiv kii aradhana se sampurna sristi main anushaasan, samanvay or prem bhakthi kaa sanchaar hone lagata he
 That is why, the song of praise says- how can i understand your infinite power
 atah he shiv, aap jis rup main bhi hon usee rup ko meraa aapako pranaam
 The combined form of Shiva and Shakti is a showcase of various dimensions of our culture
 hamaare adhikansh parv shiv-parvati ko samarpit hai
 Shiva is arrogant and it is his natural nature to be kind to others
 'shiv' shabd kaa arth he ‘kalyaan karne vaala’
 Shiva is Shankar
 shiv ke 'shan' kaa arth he kalyaan or 'kar' kaa arth he karne vaala
 Shiva, Advaita, Kalyan - all these words signify the same meaning
 shiv hi brahma hai, brahma hi shiv hai
 Brahma is the cause of the birth of the world
 garud, skanda, agni, shiv tathaa padam puraanon main mahashivaratri kaa varnan miltaa he
 Although everywhere is not the same type of story, the outline of all the stories is almost the same
 sabhi jagah is parv ke mahatv ko rekhaankit kiya gaya he or yah bataaya gaya he ki is din vrath-upwas rakhkar belptr se shiv kii puja-archana kii jaani chahie
 What do you get from the fast? 
 
 har koi chahta he ki vah bhagwaan kii aradhana kare, upwas rakhe
 At the same time, he also asks God to bless his loved ones, and wishes for progress in life
 ham aapako bataate hai ki shiv kii upasna or vrath rakhane se kya-kya fal milte hai

 bijepi kaa prachaar abhiyaan is baar jitna bada he shaayad utana pehle kabhi nahin rahaa he
 Its expansion is visible in television, newspaper, radio and on street hoardings
 pehali baar soshal media ko bhi bijepi ne prachaar ke liye zabardast dhang se istemaal kiya he
 This is the first time 3D technology has been used for publicity
 congress aarope laga rahi he ki bijepi ne prachaar par pani kii tarah paisa bahaya he
 According to the Congress, the BJP has spent more than ten thousand crores on the election campaign, but is that really so? prachaar abhiyaan se jude kai netaa baatcheet main daawa karte hai ki congress ne jo aankada diya he, bijepi ne abhi tak iskaa dasvaan hissaa yani ek hajaar karod rupaya bhi kharch nahin kiya he
 Probably on the last day of polling i
e
 till May 12, the amount spent reached around thousand crores
 pichley hafte tak prachaar abhiyaan or netaaon ke hawaii dauron par kharch kii gai rakam saadhe chah sau karod rupee ke aasapaas aa rahi thi
 It also includes the amount given by the party to candidates to contest elections
 bijepi netaaon ke mutabik, is baar party ne prachaar main sabase zyaada kharchaa outdoor vigyaapan yani sadakon par lage hording par kiya he
 In every small and big city of the country, hoardings with photo of Narendra Modi have been installed, which have different slogans of the party
 aisa kam hi hota he ki kisi shahar yaa kasbe kii sadakon par guzarate vakt abaki baar, modi sarkaar kii tag line vaale in hording par nazar na pade
 According to a rough estimate, BJP has spent around 100 crores on these hoardings
 bijepi ne mahatvapurn jagahon par lage zyaadaatar hording kii booking pehle hi kara lee thi
 That is why other parties, including the Congress, could not get these hoardings for their advertisements during the election
 dilli jaise shahar main to ye alam tha ki bijepi ke das se pandrah hording ek hi sadak par lage hue the
 Also, the city's bus stop was also flooded with advertisements containing Modi's photographs
 prachaar ke paaramparik saadhan jaise tivi, akhbaar or radio par bijepi ne dil khol kar kharchaa kiya he
 During the telecast of the cricket match, the maximum advertisements were given on sports channels and entertainment channels
 samachar channelon main sabase bada hissaa hindi or kshetreey bhashaaon ke channelon ko mila
 While the ceremony was performed on English channels
 radio par ai efem kranti kaa bijepi kaa bakhubi istemaal kiya he
 BJP advertisements are also being heard on FM radio playing in vehicles and shops in big and small cities
 akhabaaron ko bhi bijepi ke vigyaapan kaa ek bada hissaa mila he
 After the end of the campaign, the party has given full page advertisements in big newspapers
 bijepi netaaon ke mutabik paaramparik media main vigyapanon par party ne 60-70 karod rupye kharch kiye hai
 The least of the advertising budget has been spent on social media
 fasebuk or twitor par bijepi or narendra modi ke alaava kai duusare bade netaaon kii post or twit ko pramot kiya gaya
 bjp's digital advertisements have also been seen on many big websites
 party netaaon ke mutabik soshal media par vigyaapan kii rakam das karod ke aasapaas hogi
 The maximum expenditure is coming on the 3D meetings of Narendra Modi
 narendra modi ek hi din main kareeb sau jagah par in sabhaaon ko sambodhit karte hai
 There have been six rounds of 3D meetings so far
 aaj shaam saatvaan daur he, jisamen narendra modi kai rajyon main sau se bhi zyaada jagahon par prachaar karenge
 According to party leaders, for the first time in Gujarat assembly elections this technique was used for campaigning
 tab ye zyaada mahangi thi
 It has become a bit cheaper now
 iske baavjood andaaje ke mutabik 12 may tak party in sabhaaon par kareeb 200 karod rupee kharch kar chuki hogi
 There is also a lot of money being spent on airplanes and helicopters for the leaders' air tours
 rellygare, adani jaisi kai companiyon se ye kiraye par liye jate hai
 The party pays their rent through check
 narendra modi, rajnath singh, laal krishna adwani, sushamaa swaraj, nitin gadakari jaise bade netaaon ke liye charter plane kaa intazaam kiya gaya he
 The interesting thing is that many big leaders of the party are forced to fly in single engine helicopter because according to them, many helicopters with two engines have been booked by Congress
 lekin unhen udaaya nahin ja rahaa he
 When the Municipal Corporation of Uttar Pradesh-based Amroha issued an application for the recruitment of 114 Safai Karmachari, no one would have imagined that MBA, btech, Graduate and Post Graduate candidates will apply for recruitment to this post

 The application process is on and 19000 applications have been received so far, out of which 5000 applications have also been uploaded
 nagar palika ke varisht adhikari kaa kahana he ki in 19000 aavedakon main zyaadaatar emb, graduate or post graduate ummidavaar hai
 The reason behind not keeping any educational qualification was that the staff was needed to clean roads, streets and drains here
 is pad par bhartee hone vaale ummidavaaron ko har maheenaa 17, 000 rupee milane hai
 But the state government has stopped this entire recruitment process for the time being because the people of Valmiki community are agitating against this recruitment process
 unki maang he ki is pad ko unke liye arakshit kar diya jaae
 The UP government has decided to raid all 6,600 petrol pumps in the state to catch petrol theft
 haal hi main estf ne petrol panpon par kam petrol daalane ke liye remote control vaali electronic chip lagane vaale ek shaks ko pakadaa to usne 1,000 chip lagaana kabool kiya or yah bhi bataaya ki upi ke 99 fisadi petrol panpon par petrol chori karne kii chip lagi hui he
 So, on Wednesday, red started in every district on all the petrol pumps of UP simultaneously
 jila prashasan ke log har jagah par ja rahe hai
 Petrol pumps are being closed with ropes
 unki jaanch ho rahi he, kyonki sarkaar kaa kahana he ki jitne bhi 6,600 petrol pump hai, sabhi kii jaanch hogi
 This action has been taken because the person who was going to install the chip has said that 90 percent of UP petrol pumps are stolen
 yahi nahin, uskaa kahana he ki dilli or desh ke duusare ilaakon main bhi petrol panpon par petrol kii chori ho rahi he
 When Red started in Lucknow, the first petrol pumps were found to have a chip in two machines
 yahaan ab tak 15 petrol panpon par red hui he, jisamen sabhi 15 panpon main petrol chori pai gai
 ACM (II) DP Mishra of Lucknow said that they have four machines, out of which two were found to have devices
 jisase ghatatauli remote ke madhyam se kii jaati thi or mashiinon main aisi koi vyavastha nahin pai gai he
 The two machines, which were found to have a chip, are sealed
 tippaniyan The first raid was done by UP STF on 27 April
 ek petrol pump par kai petrol dispencing nozal hote hai, jinamein se kuch main chip lagi mili he, kuch main nahin
 But the whole pump is sealed when found
 is andeshe se agar upi ke zyaadaatar petrol panpon par chip nikal aae or sabhi sil kar die jaaen to pradesh thapp par jayega, isliye ab sirf us mashin ko sil ja rahaa he, jisamen chip milti he
 DP Mishra said that this has been done keeping in mind the convenience of the public, because as the information is that most of the petrol pumps have devices installed, the public can be very inconvenienced if all of them are completely closed
 lihaaza, buudhvaar ko ek saath upi ke saare petrol panpon par har jile main red shuru hui
 People of the district administration are going everywhere
 petrol panpon par rassi lagaakar unako band kiya ja rahaa he
 They are being investigated, because the government says that all the 6,600 petrol pumps are there, all will be investigated
 yah karrwai isliye shuru kii gai he, kyonki jo shaks chip lagane vaala tha, usne yah kaha he ki upi ke 90 fisadi petrol papon par petrol kii chori hoti he
 Not only this, he says that petrol is being stolen at petrol pumps in Delhi and other areas of the country
 lakhanu main red shuru hui to pehle petrol panpon par hi do mashiinon main chip lagi mili
 So far there have been raids at 15 petrol pumps, in which petrol theft was found in all 15 pumps
 lakhanu ke asiem (dwitiya) deepi mishra ne bataaya ki inke paas chaar mashine hai, jinamein se do main divaais lagi pai gai
 Due to which Ghatauli was done through remote and no such system has been found in the machines
 jin do mashiinon main chip lagi pai gai, unhen sil kar diya gaya he
 The comments upi estf ne pehali red 27 april ko kii thi
 a petrol pump has several petrol dispensing nozzles, some of which have a chip attached, some have not
 lekin milane par puraa pump sil ho rahaa he
 If the chip comes out of most of the petrol pumps in UP and all are sealed, then the state will go to a halt, so now only the machine is getting the chip
 deepi mishra ne bataaya ki yah janata kii suvidha ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kiya gaya he, kyonki jaisi soochna he ki zyaadaatar petrol panpon main divaais lagi hui he to agar ekadam se saare band ho gaye to janata ko bahut badi asuvidha ho sakati he

 Strong steps like demonetisation and GST have been taken by Narendra Modi

 Apart from this, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi has also made GST an issue to surround the Modi government

 Mizoram, a picturesque state from the natural point of view on the easternmost corner of India on the Myanmar border, presents a stark contrast to the outcry of the assembly elections to be held in the rest of India
 naa laudspikar yaa naa hi trephic roak dene vaali relia
 Where candidates of various political parties campaign from house to house and the Church plays an important role in a Christian-dominated state
 mizoram main bhi somvaar ko chunaav prachaar tham gaya
 Voting for the 40-seat Mizoram assembly is scheduled on November 28 and the results will be out on December 11
 mukhyamantri banaam mukhyamantri1987 main mizo sandhi par hastakshar ke baad astitv main aae mizoram kii raajnneeti paramparaagat taur par do dhruvon-congress or mizo neshnal front (emenef) main banty he
 This time for five times, Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla is getting a tough fight from his rival and two-time Chief Minister Joramthanga from Mizo National Party
 india today se baatcheet main mukhyamantri lalathanhawala ne kaha, 'hamane hameshaa vikaas par dhyaan diya
 Mizoram has the highest per capita income and literacy rate, so the opposition has no issues
 mizoram main koi satta virdohi lahar nahin he
 But in reality, not only is the public angry about the Congress, which ruled for ten years continuously, but the church is also angry with the government's decision to lift the ban on alcohol
 vipaksh ke netaa or purv mukhyamantri joramthanga ne kaha, 'janata badlaav ke liye betaab he, mizoram main vikaas kii gati congress ke das saal ke raaj main tham gai he
 Despite this, they are selling liquor

 If we come to power we will ban alcohol again

 The BJP, which has won the victory in 6 states out of the seven states of the Northeast, is trying hard to turn the campaign of Congress-free Northeast into truth
 bijepi ko ummid he ki yadi vidhansabha chunaav main khandit janadesh aata he to party kii bhumika rajya main satta santulan kaayam karne vaali hogi
 Himanta Vishwa Sharma, convenor of the North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), which played a key role in bjp's victory in the northeastern states, claims that the BJP will win so many seats that no government can be formed without it
 hindutv banaam isiyatahaalanki bijepi jaisi party jo bif bain kii himachati he uske liye yah kaary kathin hoga
 Zoramthanga says that the ideology of Hindutva and Christianity is very different
 isiilie carch bhi bijepi ke khilaaf he
 So there is no hope of him winning any seat
 bataa den ki carch naaraaz na ho isliye bijepi dwaara banaae gaye north east democratic alliance kaa hissaa hone ke baavjood mizo neshnal front bijepi se duuri banaae hue he
 Himanta Vishwa Sharma says that the anti-christian image of the BJP has now been demolished
 purvottar ke chaar isai bahul rajya main se teen rajyon main bijepi kii sarkaar he or vahaan ko apane dharm ko maanane kii puri swatantraaa he
 Fighting alone, BJP has fielded 39 candidates for 40 seats
 rajya main abhi tak khaataa naa khol paane vaali party is baar apane aapako kingmekar kii bhoomika dekh rahi he
 In such a situation, the question arises, will the aspirations of the BJP be fulfilled? Offer to the Chief Minister of Congress has opened all its options
 hemanth vishwa sharma kehete hai ki chaahe mukhyamantri lalthanhavaala hon yaa mizo neshnal front yaa phir joram pipuls movement kisi bhi dal kii sarkaar bijepi ke bina nahin ban sakati
 Sharma further said that if Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla wants to form the government on a personal level, then anything is possible
 aise main bijepi congress mukhyamantri ko hi chunaav ke baad apane khemen laane kaa vikalp bhi talash rahi he
 When there is a 101-run partnership for the first wicket and the entire team is dismissed at 207, then there will be some charismatic bowling behind it
 ji haa,yah karishma hi tha or ise leg spinner or team india ke maujuuda coach anil kumble ne kar dikhaaya tha
 On February 7, 1999, at the Ferozeshah Kotla ground in Delhi, Kumble did the feat in a Test match between India and Pakistan, which to date has only two bowlers in the world
 match main kumble ne pakistan ke duusare pari ke sabhi das wicket lekar record banaaya tha or england ke gym lekar ke baad aisa karne vaale duniya ke duusare gendbaaz ban gaye the
 However, in this case of 10 wickets of Anil Kumble, between two former Pakistan fast bowlers Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis are cold
 ek akhbaar main chhapi khabar ke anusaar, akram ne kaha tha ki kumble ko parfect 10 ke record se vanchit karne ke liye vakaar jaanboojhkar ran out hona chaahate the
 Waqar, in his response, has said this to Akram as a lie
 @wasimakramlive This never happened !! i think age is catching up with Wasim Bhai # nottrue

 com / zk8sdjk64u — waqar younis (@waqyounis99) February 8, 2017 Captain Kaseem Akram and Waqar Younis were present on the field when Kumble took 9 wickets of Pakistan in this match
 jaahir he das wicket lene ke liye kumble ko in donon main se kisi ek ko out karnaa tha
 Eventually his last victim was Wasim Akram
 saat farvari 1999 ko kumble ne yah record apane naam kiya tha
 Recalling Kumble's brilliant bowling, Virender Sehwag took out an old news paper from the English newspaper and tagged it on his Twitter page, writing, "kismat ko, the whole conspiracy fails"
 
 Very good Wasim brother

 Waqar's intention was to keep Kumble away from taking ten wickets
 wasim akram ke anusaar, unhone vaqaar ko samajhaayaa tha ki agar kumble ke kismat main agar 10 wicket honge to ve jarur hasil karenge
 But he himself (wasim Akram) is not going to give his wicket to Kumble
 haalanki baad main akram ko kumble ne hi out kiya tha
 After this tweet by Sehwag, former Pakistani fast bowler Waqar Younis has made Akram's statement wrong in a tweet
 is twit ke baad vakaar ne wasim akram ko tag karte hue likhaa he 'aisa kabhi nahin hua
 i think Wasim Bhai is getting older with age

 Upendra Kaul says, 'due to similar symptoms, many such cases come to me, in which a congestive heart failure is treated as an asthma attack

 He said that a common example is inhalers used to treat asthma
 agar heart felyor hone par inheler de diya jaae to gambhir erahayethamius hone se jaldi maut ho sakati he
 The symptoms of asthma and congestive heart failure, known as cardiac asthma, are similar

 dilli sarkaar main purv mantri kapil mishra ne gandhi or godse ko lekar ek blog likhaa he, jis par ab sawaal uth rahe hai
 When Aaj Tak talked to Kapil Mishra about this, he said that the way Mahatma Gandhi was killed, if there had not been a murder in that way, a lot of things would have been questioned and discussed
 gandhi kii hatya ke baad nakli gandhi unka sarnem lekar raaj karte rahe
 Kapil Mishra said that because of murder, it is a crime to speak on many such things because when a person is killed then you do not talk wrong about him
 kyonki uske bare main baat karnaa aparaadh ban jaataa he
 The former minister admitted that when he starts some work himself, he definitely goes to Rajghat
 unki khud kii gandhi main yah nishtha he
 The real Gandhian would be the one who would read Godse himself
 jisane godse ko hi nahin padhaa vah asli gandhivadi kya hoga?kapil mishra ne kaha ki aazaadee ke baad gandhiji kii bhukh hadtaal ke chalate bharat ne pakistan ko raashi di, us samay ke kai logon main yah baat acchhee nahin lagi thi
 If Gandhi had been alive, he would have discussed all the issues like his stand towards Pakistan, but the issue was completely eliminated due to the assassination
 unhone aage kaha ki maine apane blog main 'gandhi ko rashtrapita naa mana jaataa', yah maine isliye likhaa he kyonki pakistan main jinna ko sab kuch mana ja rahaa tha or vibhaajan ke samay kii gatividhiyon ke chalate baapu par bhi sawaal uthte
 In such a situation, questions were asked from Bapu on both sides, but after the murder all these questions were closed
 purv mantri ne kaha ki godse ne hatya kii isliye unke vichaaron ko log padhate nahin hai
 Had Godse been a thinker, he would have read more
 kapil mishra ke mutabik, main yah maanata hum ki vichaaron kii ladaai agar hoti to yah zyada taqatvar hoti
 Through him Bapu would also be put in the dock
 desh kii janata puuchhati, loktantr main samvaad hota, lekin hatya ho gai to sawaal-jawaab or samvaad samet sari sambhaavnaaen khatm ho gayi
 In the last days of his life, Bapu's identity was beginning to become devoted to Pakistan
 baapu kii antim memory shaayad ahimsa, satyagrah naa hokar pakistan vaali memory banati, agar 5-10 saal baapu jinda hote to isi memory ke saath jinda rahete
 He further said that perhaps Godse too would have thought that instead of adopting the path of violence, he would have fought a battle of ideas and Bapu would also think that nothing but ahimsa would happen
 sadhvi pragna thakur ke godse par die bayaan par kapil mishra ne kaha ki camel hasan ke hindu aatankwaadi vaale bayaan se ve puri tarah asahmat hai
 Godse was a murderer and a murderer should be called a murderer and not a Hindu terrorist
 aatankwaadi babar, taimur jaise log hue hai, hindu kabhi koi aatankwaadi nahin hua
 Now there are ideological terrorists in whom you can also name Kamal Haasan
 kapil mishra ne kaha ki godse kii sabase badi galati hi yahi he ki vichaar ko vichaar se band naa karke goli se khatm karne kii koshish kii
 Due to this, many fake Gandhians came, due to which the history of the country would have been different for 70 years

 2
 There are only three labs for testing in five ongoing labs where one food analyst is posted and the other 2 labs do not have any sort of analyst
 3
 There are 70 food inspectors in total in 32 districts of the state, that is, the deployment of about two inspectors per district

 There is no technology for testing the metal content in food items in any lab of the state government
 tivi today kii jaanch main saamne aae in tathyon ko rajya ke swasth nideshak biaar minaa ke saamne rakhe jane par unhone safai dete hue kaha ki unhone kabhi sochaa nahin tha kimagijaisa koi prakaran jaanch ke liye aa saktaa he lihaaja rajya kii lab antarrashtriya str ke aise pareekshan ke liye taiyaar nahin kii gai

 bihar bijepi ko ek bada jhatka tab laga jab party ke bhishma pitamah or mithilanchal ke sabase bade netaa tarakant jha ne nitish kumaar kaa daaman tham liya
 But he could not break the old relationship with the RSS, nor hide his passion for Narendra Modi
 jediu main shaamil hone ke maukey par yojit press conference main tarakant jha ne kaha ki wo aaj bhi aresas kii vichaardhaara se jude hai or modi ke netritv se unhen koi shikaayat nahin thi
 He only had a complaint with Sushil Modi and that is why he joined JDU

 The press conference ended in a hurry but it became clear that JDU may have placed bets on big fish but at the last moment the bet was reversed
 tarakant jha jansangh ke vakt se bijepi ke majboot stambh rahe hai or haal tak wo bihar vidhaan parishad ke sabhapati the
 His differences with Sushil Modi were not hidden from anyone and it is expected that he will once again go to the Legislative Council from the JDU quota
 bijepi netaa susheel modi ne kaha ki tarakant jha ke jane ke baad ab ye ho saktaa he ki nitish ji modi ke naam par maan jaaen, kyonki tarakantaji na sirf sangh se jude hai balki modi ko bhi apana netaa maanate hai
 In such a situation, it is expected that Tarakant Jha will succeed in persuading Nitishji soon

 The Income Tax Department's Shikanjagadkari on Nitin Gadkari's son addressed a general meeting after unveiling the life-size statue of Lakhiram Agarwal, senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Kharsian on Thursday, saying that the worker becomes the chief minister and prime minister in the Bharatiya Janata Party

 lekin asaliyat yah he ki gorakhpur samet kai siton par jahaan yogi adityanath helicopter main ghumkar prachaar kar rahe hai to sunil singh bijepi ke kai ummidavaaron ko chunaav main dhul chataane ke liye puri takat laga rahe hai
 The game of defeating BJP is happening behind the scenes! Sunil Singh is a new player in the field of politics but his relationship with Yogi Adityanath is 25 years old
 kuch samay pehle tak sunil singh yogi adityanath kii sanstha hindu yuva vahini ke pradesh adhyaksh the or yogi ke sabase vishwaas paatr logon main se the
 He was confident that Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath would reward him with service and get him a ticket in the assembly elections
 lekin jab tikat nahin mil paaya to sunil singh yogi adityanath ke sammaan kii ladaai ladane ke naam par baagi ho gaye
 Now the Hindu Yuva Vahini has fielded its candidates in 14 seats in Gorakhpur and adjoining areas
 yahi nahin bataaya ja rahaa he ki kai siton par bijepi ke ummidavaaron ko haraane ke liye sunil singh ke log parade ke peeche kaam kar rahe hai
 Yogi Adityanath has removed Sunil Singh from the post of President of Hindu Yuva Vahini due to the persistent insulting of Adityanath in BJP but Sunil Singh claims that Adityanath's blessings are with him
 unka kahana he ki bijepi main lagaataar adityanath kaa apmaan ho rahaa he
 He was neither made a minister at the Center nor was he projected as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh despite being a popular leader
 sunil singh kehete hai ki yogi adityanath ko chunaav sanchaalan samiti main bhi nahin rakhaa gaya or bijepi ke postaron main unki tasviir bhi gaayab he
 Yogi does not go to campaign! If Yogi Adityanath is getting such a scorn in BJP then why does he remain the star campaigner of BJP? In response to this question, Sunil Singh says that BJP leaders have probably cast black magic on Adityanath
 yogi kaa aashirwad unke saath he is baat ko sabit karne ke liye sunil singh bataate hai ki jin jagahon par unhone ummidavaar khadey kiye hai vahaan par yogi adityanath khud chunaav prachaar ke liye nahin ja rahe hai
 Winning this seat, Sunil Singh is not the only disciple who rebelled from his nose and landed in the field
 gorakhnath mandir jiske peethadhishwar yogi adityanath hai, uske thik bagal main gorakhpur gramin vidhansabha shuru hoti he
 Apparently being next to the place of Gorakhnath, this seat is a nose question for Jitwana Yogi Adityanath
 is seat se maujuuda vidhayak vijay bahadur yadav bhi ek samay unke kareebi chelon main se ek the
 Yogi Adityanath had an important role in getting him tickets and winning elections
 lekin baad main vijay bahadur yadav kaa yogi adityanath se matbhed ho gaya or ab vah isi seat se samaajawaadee party ke tikat par chunaav lard rahe hai
 "yogi remove, strength is nothing" Vijay Bahadur Yadav still avoids speaking directly against Yogi Adityanath
 lekin kuch kurede jane par itnaa tapaak se kah dete hai ki adityanath ke naam se yogi hataa diya jaae to unki takat kuch bhi nahin he
 What he means by this is that Yogi Adityanath is the Peethadheeshwara of Gorakhnath Temple, that's why people respect him
 kya vah yogi ke khilaaf baghawat kar ke chunaav jeet sakate hai? is sawaal par vijay bahadur singh kehete hai ki logon ko aisa vidhayak chahie jo har dukh dard main unke saath maujuud ho or jise jarurat padane par wo baanh pakad kar roak saken
 This is not typical of Adityanath and his people
 hindu yuva vahini ek saanskrithik sansthasunil singh jaise netaaon ke bare main poochne par adityanath yah kehete hai ki hindu yuva vahini ek saanskrithik sanstha he or uske naam par koi chunaav nahin lard saktaa
 Many believe that Adityanath himself is angry that he is not getting the importance he deserves in the BJP
 isliye sunil singh jaise netaaon se unki sachmuch hamadardi hai
 Yogi Adityanath is identified as a strong Hinduist leader in Paschorakhpur and its adjoining areas of 3 seats out of 9
 lekin yah bhi sach he ki vah khud loksabhaa kaa chunaav bhale hi aaraam se jeet jate ho vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ke ummidavaaron ko us tarah se nahin jitwa pate
 In the last assembly election too, out of 9 seats in Gorakhpur, BJP could win only 3 seats
 bijepi ke liye mahatvapoornbijapi uttar pradesh main sarkaar banane kii koshish main kitni kaamyaab hoti he, vah kaaphi kuch is baat par nirbhar karata apane ilaake main is baar yogi adityanath kaa sikaa chalata he yaa nahin

 Trollers say that there is pollution, corruption, poverty and many other problems in the country, but Hema has to do with monkeys
 itnaa hi nahin unhone film sholay ke naam par bhi hema kaa majaak banaaya
 Some people also shared many memes in Hema's name
 ek yujar ne kaha, 'mujhe lag rahaa tha ki bandaron kii baat karte hue ye pradooshan, bhrashtachar or hamaari arth vyavastha ke bare main bhi kuch bolengi lekin aisa nahin hua
 i think they have taken their habit of ignoring the things of spring slightly more seriously

 — Pragya Roy Bhatt (@pragyaroybhatt1)november 22, 2019security behind thinking kiska guard bana dia🤣— jasss (@jashim_hasi)november 22, 2019 Extending his support for the BJP even outside the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Friday raised a broom to signal new friendship between the two parties
 pavaar ne apni beti evam saansad supriya sule, maharashtra ke purv upmukhyamantri ajit pavaar samet apane parivaar ke sadasyon or party mahasachiv deepi treepathi ke saath apane grihnagar baraamati main camaron ke bich ek sadak kii safai kii
 Pawar's move is considered to be his acceptance of the 'clean India' campaign of the NDA government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 baharhaal, is abhiyaan main ensipi kii ek alag pahchaan kii chhap chhodane ke prayaas ke tahat, pavaar ne kuch din pehle ek samvaadadaata sammelan yojit kiya tha
 At that conference, he had announced that his party workers would launch a cleanliness drive in Maharashtra in view of the increasing cases of dengue
 baraamati main abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karne ke baad unhone kaha, hamane aaj swatchta abhiyaan shuru kiya he or tasviren lee gai hai
 But we have to ensure that there is no garbage on the streets tomorrow
 panchayat ajtak himachal pradesh ke ahm satr chunaav kii chunauti main bijepi ke himachal ikai ke adhyaksh suresh bharadwaj ne shirkat kii
 The session was conducted by Punya Prasun Vajpayee
 bharadwaj ne kaha ki party ne prem kumaar dhumal ko mukhyamantri pad ke liye aage kiya
 Even before this party announcement, Dhumal was leading the party in the state
 bharadwaj ne kaha ki himachal pradesh main virbhadra singh kii congress sarkaar apane kaarykaal ke dauraan vaadon ko puraa nahin kar saki he
 Therefore, there is an atmosphere of anti-incumbency against him in the entire state, so this time the BJP government is going to be formed in the state
 naukari kaa vaada nahin hua poorabharadwaj ne kaha ki rajya main congress ne 10 lakh logon ko naukari dene kaa vaada kiya tha lekin 5 saal ke dauraan yah aankada ek lakh tak nahin pahunchaa
 Due to this, unemployment is a big issue in the current state elections
 bharadwaj ne kaha ki aam janata use satta main baithaati he jisapar unhen bharosa rahata he
 Due to this, despite having a Congress government in the state 6 times, he has never failed to win elections twice in a row
 kahaan se aata he ummidavaaron ke paas chunaav fundrajya main chunaav kharch kii prati ummidavaar kii 28 lakh rupee kii seemaa ke aadhaar par ek vidhansabha main karodon rupee kharch hote hai
 So, how much funds come in state elections? Is this why a common man stays outside the election process? Also read: Panchayat Aaj Tak: Battle in Himachal Elections BJP vs Virbhadrasuraresh Bhardwaj said that money is the crucial link in the current elections
 lihaaja, desh main chunaav sudhaar ek badi jarurat he jisase mahaj paise ke dam par koi vyakti ummidavaar na banane paae
 However, Bhardwaj said that at present there is some goodness in elections
 ab chunaavon main pehle kii tarah paper poster kaa istemaal nahin hota
 This has not only reduced the pressure on election expenses, but has also stopped the use of paper and the walls of cities are also clean
 bharadwaj ne kaha ki bhrashtachar ke liye raajnneeti kii bhi jimmedaari he
 After becoming a big leader in politics, there is also pressure on mlas and mps to earn the expenses of the next election

 (input bhashaa se) Tiger Shroff is busy preparing for his film Baaghi-2 these days

 com / bfy23qxmvk— Tiger Shroff (@itigershroff)september 3, 2017kaha ja rahaa he ki film main tiger dabl role kar rahe hai
 Actually Tiger is seen in double role in this video
 unhone video ko capshan bhi kuch aisa diya he ki lagata he ye maamla dabl role kaa hi he
 Then comes Coming Soon written in the video, so one has to be forced to think that this issue is related to Baaghi-2
 vaise agar tiger is film main dabl role karte hai,to yah film or darshakon ke liye dabl dhamal hoga
 The shooting of this film has started last month
 film mentiger kii garlfriend disha pataanihi unke apojit hai
 It is said that Shraddha was very keen to do this role in the film
 vaise wo baghi se bhi judi thim, isliye ye utsukata hona jaahir si baat he
 However, the filmmakers have confirmed that the Tiger duo will be made with Disha Patani
 ye un phens ke liye khushkhabari he or tiger ke liye sone par suhaaga
 After all, both will get an opportunity to spend more time with this excuse

 is bich disha ko bhi chot bhi lag gai thi
 He was advised to rest for two weeks

 The sixth season of the Indian Premier League i
e
 the IPL is just about to end
 26 may ko final match he
 But the real contest of the Indian Underworld League is going to start now
 22 gaj kii pich par bikhare 40 hajaar karod rupee kii khatir hindustani anderworld kii do sabase khoonkhaar timen di-company or chota rajan ab khul kar aamane-saamne aa gayi hai
 The two are blaming each other for the current fixing in the IPL, stating themselves to be clean and clean
 nigaah main ipel ke mukaable or najar main 40 hajaar karod kaa satta
 Apparently, two of India's bloodiest bloodshed gangs are playing their biggest claim so far on this amount
 ek taraf indiaj most wanted daaud ibrahim kii di company he to duusari taraf chota rajan kaa khaufnak gang or inke bich he 22 gaj kii wo pich jahaan ab har gend par karodon kaa daanv he to donon chor par par in do jaani dushmano ke bookies hai
 When Rajasthan Royals star player Sreesanth came under police arrest, when the biggest disclosure of fixing was revealed, the finger landed directly on Dawood Ibrahim's d Company
 police jaanch ke mutabik daaud ke bhai anis ibrahim kii shah par hi sara khel rachaa gaya
 Anees and Shakeel together run Dawood's d-company from Karachi, but in an exclusive conversation with Aaj Tak, Chhota Shakeel put the charge of fixing on his known enemy Chhota Rajan
 sach to yah he ki chota shakeel kaa yah iljaam ek baar phir se gangvaar kii shuruyaat he, jo is baar drugs or real estate kii jagah cricket kii pich par ho rahi he
 But as soon as this statement of Chhota Shakeel came on Aaj Tak, Chhota Rajan's gang stirred
 kuch hi der main chota rajan kii taraf se jawaab aayaa ki di company apane upar lagi tohamaton se bachane ke liye phixing kaa iljaam dusron par laga rahi he
 Rajan says Chhota Shakeel is misleading the police
 phixing ke peeche chota rajan kaa koi lenaa-dena nahin he, phixing kii sajeesh daaud ke bhai anis ibrahim ne rachi he
 It is also not a minor thing when two enemies come together and speak against each other
 ishaara saaf he ki donon main yah gangvaar kii ek nai shuruyaat he
 The only difference is that the two most dreaded gangs of India have chosen a cricket pitch for the first time because of the Rs 40 thousand crores on that pitch, which has both eyes on
 darasal cricket betting ko lekar daaud or rajan ke sindicket barason se varchasv kaa khooni khel khel rahe hai or is khooni khel kaa aagaaj san 2000 main hua
 When Sharad Shetty was gunned down in Dubai
 betting ke godfadar sharad shethti ko chota rajan ke shootaron ne dubai ke india club main maut ke ghat utaar kar dakshin asia main kkicket satte kaa ek chhatra raaj kaayam kar liya
 After Sharad Shetty's murder, Vinod Chembur became Raja's reckless king of cricket betting
 lekin chota rajan kaa raaj zyada din nahi likhaa tha kuch hi dinon main di company ne ek badi sajeesh ke tahat bainkak main chota rajan par palatwaar kiya or ek sansanikhej shootout ko anjaam diya jisame rajan to bal-bal batch niklaa par uske gurgey dher ho gaye
 After this shootout, Rajan announced to take Intekam from d Company in a special interview
 rajan or daaud ke bich jo jang kii aag barason se lagi he usamen ab ghi kaa kaam kiya he phixing kii is nai fans ne, vajah sirf gangvaar nahin balki 40 hajaar karod rupee ke cricket kaa satta he

 Baba Ramdev said that he condemns any inhuman act
 congress ke aaropon par ramdev kaa kahana he ki vah janata ke numaayinde hai, bhaajapa, aresas ke nahin
 As far as the allegations of attempting to flee from wearing women's clothes, Baba said that he respected women and the central government was plotting to assassinate him so he ran out of the ground in women's clothes
 unka kahana tha ki apni jaan bachaane ke liye mahilaon ke vastra pahananaa koi aparaadh nahin he
 It is not a matter of shame but pride for them

 mangalvaar ko modi cabinet main hue vistaar ne empi kii raajnneeti main ek baar phir bhuuchaal paidaa kar diya he
 During the expansion of Shivraj's cabinet barely four days ago, two strong leaders of the state Babulal Gaur and Sartaj Singh were asked to resign from the post citing their age
 lekin mangalvaar ko jab modi cabinet main najma hepatulla or calraj mishra kii chuttee nahin hui to empi ke in do netaaon kii tyoriyaan chadh gayi
 The resignation was sought after citing age
 Actually, Shivraj cabinet was expanded in Bhopal on 30 June
 lekin shapath grahan se pehle hi madhya pradesh bijepi adhyaksh nandkumar singh chouhan khud babulal gaur or sartaaj singh ke ghar pahunche the or istife kaa farmaan sunaaya tha
 The high command's policy was stated behind the resignation, according to which those above 75 years of age will not be given ministerial posts
 haalanki in donon mantriyon se istipha lene main bijepi ke paseene chhot gaye the
 Eventually both had to bow to the party's decree
 lekinmodi cabinatmen apane ham umr netaaon ko dekh pradesh ke purv mantri sartaaj singh khud ko thaga sa mahasoos karne lage
 Sartaj Singh is now finding the decision of the party to be excessive
 iske saath hi sartaaj ne saaf kar diya ki wo is masale par chup nahin baithenge or party alaakaman se sawaal puuchhenge ki kya unhen hataane kaa faisla centre se hua yaa phir madhya pradesh se
 Sartaj was hurt by the decision on talking on the phone
 unhone ise party ke karmath kaaryakarta ke saath dhokhaa bataaya
 If Babulal Gaur talks about it, he seems to be avoiding speaking more on this matter
 mangalvaar shaam ko jab empi ke purv grih mantri rah chuke babulal gaur se hamane baat kii to unhone us par pratikriya dene se inkaar kar diya, lekin jis tarah se congress netaaon se gaur in dinon apane ghar par mil rahe hai wo ishaara jarur he ki faisle se gaur naaraaz to hai
 Let me tell you that Gaur has won the assembly elections 10 times and is considered one of the most powerful mps
 congress ne lee chutakivahin modi cabinet ke vistaar par madhya pradesh congress ne chutki lete hue poocha ki jis tarah shivaraj cabinet se umradraj bataakar babulal gaur or sartaaj singh ko hataaya gaya wo formula kendra ne kyon nahin apanaaya? pradesh congress ke pravaktaa keke mishra ne aarope lagaaya he ki siem shivaraj singh chouhan ne pradesh ke donon mantriyon ko hataane ke liye umradraj hone kaa sahaara jarur liya he, lekin siem shivaraj singh ne babulal gaur or sartaaj singh ko vyaktigat kuntha or rajnatik asuraksha kii bhaavana ki chalate hataaya he naa ki umradraj hone ke kaaran
 Congress honors elderly leader Even though the BJP may have expelled two of its ministers from the cabinet citing age, Congress on Tuesday congratulated and honored its former MLA and senior leader Hazarilal Raghuvanshi for his 87th birthday
 nirmaataa-nirdeshak vishaal bharadwaj kehete hai ki ek filmkaar ke taur par vah rachanaatmak safalataa kii khoj main hai, kyonki yah safalataa kii apeksha vyakti ke saath zyada samay tak rahati he
 Vishal, the director of films like 'maqbool' and 'omkara', is now busy with his upcoming film 'dedh Ishqiya'
 yah film 2010 main ai 'ishkia' kaa aglaa sanskaran he
 Actress Madhuri Dixit will be seen in a new avatar in the film
 chote shahar kii kahani par aadhaarit is film main nasiruddin shah, arshad varsi or huma kuraishi bhi hai
 The film will hit theaters on January 10
 bharadwaj ne ek samuhik saakshaatkaar main samvaadadaataaon se kaha, "main kabhi safalataa nahin dekhtaa, main rachanaatmak santushti chahta hum
 Success comes and goes, but creative satisfaction remains with you
 yah behatar he ki main use chahta hum
 Box office success has no meaning for me
 " Vishal has co-written for 'dedh Ishqiya' and has once again teamed up with 'ishqiya' director Abhishek Chaubey
 jab yah poocha gaya ki unhone film kaa nirdesan khud kyon nahin kiya? bharadwaj ne jawaab diya, "main 'maha kamine' par bahut aakarshith tha kyonki 'kamine' film kaa nirdesan maine kiya tha
 i have written this film, but it is more of Abhishek's film
 vah manaa kar dete to ham aglaa sanskaran nahin banaate
 " testla apni electric vehical kii manuphaccharing ab china ke shanghai main shuru karne ja rahi he
 At the same time, the Modi government in the country is considering approving companies like Tesla and Apple to manufacture in India for the last one year
 kya ham mek in india kii sharton par khare utarane vaali companiyon ko pahachaanate rah jaaenge or ek-ek kar multinational companiyaan duusare deshon main apni factriyaan lagaati rahengi?testla ink ke pramukh ilon musk or china sarkaar main nai factory lagane ke liye shanghai shahar ko chunane par sahmati ban chuki he
 This claim has been made by Wall Street Journal
 america se baahar yah testla kii pehali factory hogi jahaan bhavishya ke liye emishan free gadiyon kaa nirmaan kiya jayega
 For this agreement, the Chinese government would have approved this Tesla unit in Shanghai's Free Trade Zone, bypassing the many conditions of Make in China
 ab china main lagane vaali testla kii yah factory na sirf china kii electric car banane kii koshishon ko saakaar karegi balki yah bhi darshaaegi ki kaise mek in india jaise flagship kaarykram ke baavjood ham duniya ke manuphaccharing hav banane kii daud main pichad rahe hai
 So the question is, where is the mistake? Why is Tesla going to set up a factory in China in 2015 in front of Prime Minister Modi? In 2015, Elon Musk met PM Modi to make this offer
 iske baavjood aisa kyon hua ki is daud main bharat pichad gaya
 Looking at some of Elon Musk's tweets, the answer is that India is a lazy country and it does not even try to understand the real needs of multinational companies doing business with them
 ise bhi padhein: ilon musk kaa vaada, is saal bharat aegi testla 'supercharging car'bharat apni sadako par electric car daudana chahta he
 He is trying to sell most of the electric cars variants in the country by 2030
 iske baavjood usne testla jaisi company ko desh main factory lagane ke liye protsaahit karne kii koi koshish nahin kii
 But the question is not that after the decision to set up a Tesla factory in China, there can no longer be a second Tesla unit in India
 lekin yahaan samasya yah he ki bharat mek in india kii shart par ada he ki kisi bhi videshi company ko bharat main mek in india kaarykram ke tahat utpaadan karnaa he to use kam se kam 30 fisadi kal-purje bharat se hi lene honge
 So, when there is no sign of electric cars in India and no one is making parts for it, the Make in India program wants that the company that makes electric cars in the country will make the first one-third parts The unit was set up in India and then it got approval to manufacture in the country under Make in India
 isi shart main fansaa appal kii yphone factrimek in india kii is shart se testla akele nahin pareshaan he
 The same is happening with the American smartphone company Apple
 beete ek saal se appal koshish main he ki vah apane smartphone samet anya product kii manuphaccharing bharat main kare
 But even before that, the trouble is to get one-third parts from India
 appal kaa maananaa he ki uske kal-purje behad kii sookshm takniki se viksit hue he or duniya ke chuninda jagahon par unki manuphaccharing kii ja rahi he
 Therefore, in order to make Apple products in India, it is necessary for Apple to get the components from these same suppliers because India does not yet have the capability to manufacture parts for such products
 lihaaja, isi shart par philhal appal or bharat sarkaar kii baatcheet chal rahi he or ummid he ki yah baatcheet kii kisi nishkarsh par na pahunche
 Now even in China, there are very strict rules for approving any foreign company to manufacture
 kuch maamalon main to china ke niyam itane kade hai ki koi multinational companiyaan china kaa rukh karne kii pahal bhi nahin karti
 Despite this, she does not take time to decide on the initiatives of companies like Apple and Tesla, nor does she delay in making any concession to these companies because she knows that imposing conditions will only harm and where to take advantage
 For, she can remove the conditions
 yahi samaj bharat main philhal nahin he or yahi nateeja he ki beete teen saal se mek in india jaisaa kaarykram maujuud hone ke baad bhi desh main phaayde or nuksaan ke masaude par faisla nahin liya ja paa rahaa he
 Whenever Virat Kohli, the captain of Team India, lands on any ground for any format of cricket, there is a record waiting for him
 buudhvaar se shuru ho rahe srilanka ke khilaaf pehle test match main kohli kuch record apane naam kar itihaas rach sakate hai
 In such a situation, everyone's attention will be on Virat Kohli's batting
 kohli bana sakate hai yah recordcaptain viraat kohli shandaar form main chal rahe
 He is 101 runs away from scoring 2500 runs as a captain in Test cricket
 iske alaava kohli videshi dharti par ek captain ke taur par 1000 ran banane se mahaj 53 ran dur hai
 Not only this, if Kohli makes 53 or 103 in the first innings of the first Test, then his batting average will be 50 in all three formats of cricket
 bhubaneshwar or jadeja bhi bana sakate hai recordviraat kohli ke alaava team india ke swing gendbaaj bhubaneshwar kumaar or rabindra jadeja bhi kuch record bana sakate hai
 Bhubaneswar is just 5 wickets away from taking 50 wickets in Test cricket
 iske alaava rabindra jadeja ko test cricket main 150 ran puure karne ke liye aath wicket kii darkaar he
 Ashwin will also be on the lookout for Ashwin in 32 matches
 25 kii ausat ke saath 1903 ran banaae hai
 He is just 97 runs behind from scoring 2000 runs
 iske alaava unhone 2
 With an economy of 88, he has taken 275 wickets in 49 Test matches
 aise main wo 25 wicket lekar 300 ke aankade ko paar sakate hai
 However, this work seems a bit difficult
 lekin srilanka kii spin friendli wicket ko dekhakar kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 If he manages to do so, Ashwin will break the record of former New Zealand great all rounder Richard Hadley
 hadlee ne yah karnama 54 test match khelkar puraa kiya tha
