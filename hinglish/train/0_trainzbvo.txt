 Then the plan was kamraj kaa or aaj plan ko anjaam dete dikh rahe hai rahul gandhi
 
 
 That is why after Gandhi May 23, with Rahul Gandhi resigning, he is on the path of changes in the Congress, it is being called Kamaraj Plan-2
 aaj 15 july ko ke
 It is also the birth anniversary of Kamaraj and hence it is necessary to discuss it
 baat 1963 kii he, jab 1962 ke china yuddh ke baad congress sawaalon se ghiri hui thi
 Opposition attacks on the Congress government led by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru were intensifying
 chunaav aane vaale the
 Of then kamraj congress main nai jaan foonkane ke liye nayaa plan lekar aae
 This was known as Kamaraj Plan
 unhone sujhaayaa ki party ke bade netaa sarkaar main apane padon se istipha de den or apni urja congress main nai jaan foonkane ke liye lagaaein
 What was the Kamaraj Plan? kamraj ne is yojana ke tahat pehle khud istipha diya
 Then leaders like Lal Bahadur Shastri, Jagjivan Ram, Morarji Desai and SK Patil also relinquished government positions
 congress ke 6 cabinet mantri or 6 mukhyamantriyon ne apni kursi tyaag di or party sanghathan main kaam karne chale gaye
 On one hand, while the Congress organization got big and effective leaders, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru also got the opportunity to form his new team in the government
 ke
 With this plan, Kamaraj became so strong in the politics of the Center that Pt
 nehru ke nidhan ke baad bahadur shastri or indira gandhi ko pradhanmantri banavaane main unki bhoomika kingmekar kii rahi
 He was also Congress President three times
 unhen varsh 1976 main bharat ratna se sammanit kiya gaya
 After this, Rahul Gandhi, after the crushing defeat of Congress in the 2019 general election after 2014, seems to be growing on this plan
 kamraj jaise plan par hi aage badhate hue dikh rahe hai
 Taking responsibility for the defeat after the results on 23 May, Rahul Gandhi resigned from the post of Congress President
 iske baad congress main netaaon ke istifon kii jhadi lag gai
 Many state presidents, general secretaries, all the leaders including the secretary started resigning from the party's posts following Rahul Gandhi
 party main rahul se istipha waapas lene kii maang hone lagi
 But Rahul Gandhi made it clear that he no longer wants to continue as Congress President
 rahul kaa 'dard' banegaa congress kii dawa?lekin rahul gandhi isse bhi santusht nahin hue
 On 25 June, Rahul Gandhi appeared in front of the media and said that i am no longer the president of the Congress
 party ko apana nayaa adhyaksh chun lenaa chahie
 Rahul also made it clear that the next president should not be from the Gandhi family
 rahul gandhi ne apane istife kii 4 pej kii chitthee ko saarvajanik kar di
 In this letter, Rahul Gandhi expressed his direct displeasure that the Congress leaders should take responsibility for the defeat and it is very painful that many leaders did not resign taking responsibility
 rahul ne kaha ki ab ve sadak par janata kii ladaai ladenge
 Rahul's pain came out
 uske baad party main istifon kii line lag gai
 So far, more than 200 Congress officials have submitted their resignations
 upi, madhya pradesh, pashchim bengal, maharashtra, punjab samet tamaam rajyon se netaaon ne istife die
 Many leaders are still frozen in positions, although many leaders still involved in central politics remain in their posts but after Rahul's resignation, the pressure on them is also increasing
 darasal rahul gandhi congress ke kayakalp ke plan par aage badhate dikh rahe hai
 So as to strengthen the organization
 agle saal dilli, haryana, maharashtra or jharkhand samet kai rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Before that Rahul wants to mold Congress into a new club
 varisht netaaon ke aae suzavarahul gandhi ke istife ke baad party shoonyata kii sthiti main he
 However, several suggestions are also coming
 party ke varisht netaa karn singh ne antarim party adhyaksh banane kaa suzav diya he
 He also stated that unless a full-time chairman is nominated, four executive presidents should be nominated for North, South, East and West
 lekin sonia gandhi ke kareebi rahe janardan dvivedi ne kaha ki rahul gandhi abhi bhi takneekee rup se congress adhyaksh hai
 He should constitute a committee to suggest the name of his successor before resigning
 janardan dvivedi kii raay saaf he
 He is in favor of removing people from active positions after the age of 70 in politics
 varishton kii jagah bhar sakate hai yuva netajarnadan dvivedi kii raay rahul ke plan ke anukool he
 Most of the young leaders have resigned after Rahul Gandhi's resignation
 rahul gandhi kaa anusaran karte hue haal hi main jyotiraditya sindhiya or milind devda ne bhi istipha de diya
 But the party's focus is on advancing young leaders in the organization instead of 70 leaders
 70 paar netaaon par najarmotilal vora, gulam nabi aaazaad, dow
 Manmohan Singh, Ambika Soni, AK Antony, Mallikarjun Kharge, K
 siddharmaiya, kamalnath, harish ravat, tarun gogoi, digvijay singh or oman chandi jaise netaa 70 kii umr paar kar chuke hai
 Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is also more or less the same age
 congress ke anya varisht netaa bhupendra singh hooda, susheel kumaar scindia, pi
 Chidambaram, Amarinder Singh and Kapil Sibal are also of the same age
 dekhnaa hoga party apane nae avatar main varisht or yuva netaaon main kaise saamanjasy baithaati he
 Because the Congress is in opposition at the center and is in power in only a few states, then leaders can be given a place in the party organization itself
 lekin rahul gandhi agar kamraj plan-2 ko lagu karne main kaamyaab hote hai to desh kii sabase puraani party congress yuva chehron or nai soch ke saath desh ke yuvaaon se khud ko jodne kii raah par chal padegi

 He was expelled after passing a resolution based on a special committee report

 Significantly, Singh was expelled from the remaining term of the 13th Assembly of Punjab and the Election Commission asked him to vacate his seat so that the by-election for the Patiala assembly seat could be held
 singh is seat kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahe the
 However, the recommendation made by the committee regarding the declaration of this seat to the Election Commission was vacant by the apex court

 He has argued that the Legislative Assembly has no right to expel him for his executive decisions

 On Wednesday, Maken said that the Delhi High Court, taking cognizance of a PIL, had given a notice to the government on June 1 to look into the case of Chinese Manjhe
 lekin sarkaar dhai maheene tak soti rahi
 Now after the death of 4 children, the government has come out with the draft notification on 16 August

 During the hearing in the same case, on August 2, the Delhi government said in the High Court that the Chinese man cannot be banned, because a public notification will have to be issued for 6 months
 jabaki yachikakarta kii ore se kaha gaya ki maamla janata kii janmaal se judaa he, isliye maanjhe par tatkaal roak lagaani hogi

 While acquitting Yogesh Shinde, who was sentenced to five years rigorous imprisonment in the case of rape of his neighbor's wife in Ulhasnagar in Thane district, the court found it impossible to find the details of the allegation made by the prosecution and the incident given by the victim

 Justice AM Thipsay, in his recent pronouncement, said, although a woman is unlikely to be falsely accused of rape under normal circumstances, when she is caught having sex with or under extramarital affairs If in doubt, then there is every possibility that in an attempt to save her character, she can claim that her consent in whatever happened Was not

 usne yah bhi kaha ki jameen par pathar pade the

 pakistan pipuls party (pipipi) ke kaamkaaj ko lekar raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari ke saath manmutav ke baad unke bete bilaval bhutto jaradaari desh se chale gaye hai
 The departure of this star campaigner from Pakistan just before the election is a major setback for the PPP
 haal hi main bilaval ko pipipi kaa mukhya sangrakshak namit kiya gaya tha
 He, along with his father Zardari and Bua Faryal Talpur, had a grudge over handling the party on certain issues
 inamen aatankwaadi hinsa, shiya samudaay ke khilaaf ho rahe hamale or tikaton ke mudde shaamil hai
 Pakistan is to have a parliamentary election on May 11

 According to sources, Bilawal was very angry about the party's stand on issues affecting the youth
 yah us vakt hua he jab imran khan kii pakistan taharik-e-insaaf yuvaaon ko lubhaane ke liye puri takat jhonk rakhi he
 Sources said that 24-year-old Bilawal was also upset with the attitude of his aunt Faryal Talpur as he refused to give tickets to some candidates in Sindh province who were recommended by Bilawal himself
 ek sutara ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòpichley maheene bilaval ne kareeb 200 pipipi kaaryakartaaon ke ke naam sujhaaye the or sindh ke purv mukhyamantri kaim ali shah se unhen kaam dene ke liye kaha tha, lekin faryal ne isamen dakhal diya
 After this, there was a rift between aunt and nephew

 According to sources once the matter got hot and Bilawal said, "if i want to vote, i will not vote for PPP
" ‚Äô‚Äô Bilawal's sudden move to Dubai last week has led to uneasiness within the PPP as the party wanted to woo those voters by putting them ahead in the elections, while Bhutto has been a traditional voter for the family
 pipipi ke ek netaa ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòbilaval ko pipipi ke star prachaarak ke rup main pesh kiya gaya kyonki raashtrapati hone ke kaaran jaradaari chunaav prachaar main shaamil nahin ho sakate
 "without Bilawal, the feelings of the party people, especially the ardent supporters of PPP, would not be touched," he said
 ‚Äô‚Äô is netaa ne kaha ki unhen dar he ki bilaval ke chunaav prachaar main bhaag nahin lene se pipipi ko ‚Äòbhutto vot‚Äô nahin mil sakenge
 PPP leaders have admitted that Bilawal will not be present on the occasion of the start of PPP election campaign from Garhi Khuda Baksh on April 4

 His government was based on lies and defection which fell like cards
 'surajevaala ne kaha, 'aaj kaa din pradhanmantri narendra modi va grih mantri amit shah kii jabaabadehi bhi sunishchit karne kaa he
 'he asked,' Why created a spectacle of democracy in Maharashtra? Why used the governor as a puppet? Why did the President's dignity hurt? "the Congress leader said," Answer Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, why did the country's cabinet become paralyzed? Why the naked orgy of defection and buying horse? Why did a minority government form a majority drama for so many days? Why take back corruption cases? Why was the Constitution torn apart?

 karnataka main jari uthapatak par sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne maamle ko mangalvaar tak ke liye taal diya he or kaha ki tab tak yatha sthiti rahe
 Earlier, Advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the rebel mlas, said that the Speaker of the Assembly held a press conference and said that the mlas should have come to me, they should not have gone to the Supreme Court
 spikar ne kaha ki mujhe puri raat istifon ko padhanaa he
 i am accountable to the public
 baagi vidhayakon kii taraf se kaha gaya ki spikar ne kal kaha ki supreme court hamen nirdesh nahi de saktaa
 The speaker also said that i will first see the resignation and then decide and have not given any decision yet
 baagi vidhayakon kii taraf se kaha gaya ki ye maamla keval istipha kaa he
 Rebel public, TV and courts are saying everywhere that they want to resign
 is par pradhan nyaayadhish ne poocha ki spikar kaa faisla kya he, to baagi vidhayakon kii taraf se kaha gaya ki abhi tak spikar kii taraf se kuch nahi kaha gaya he
 Legislative assembly session is starting today, the Speaker simply wants to disqualify the mlas
 mukul rohtagi ne kaha ki congress kii ore se vip jari kiya gaya he or is tarah to vah ayogy ghoshit ho jaaenge
 Advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing on behalf of the speaker, said that the constitution also has full details of what will be the procedure before accepting the resignation of an MLA
 spikar kii taraf se kaha gaya kanoon ke hisaab se spikar jab santusht honge tab istipha sweekaar hota he
 It takes time
 jis tarah se yachikakarta chaahate he ki turant kiya jaae ye sambhav nahin he
 First, it is seen whether the resignation is correct or not

 We are just telling the process
 singhvi ne aage kaha ki sabhi das vidhayakon ke khilaaf ayogyata kii karrwahee chal rahi he
 Action against eight of these commenced before the speaker reached his resignation
 vidhayak spikar se milane kii bajaae mumbai jaakar resort main ruuk gaye
 The resignation of the legislators is on the constitutional post of the speaker was not in the correct format
 kal hi unhone ise sahi kiya he
 The hearing will be held again on Tuesday

 One of the petitioners is involved in the Ponzi scam that has been asked for resignation
 yah yachika sunwaayee yogya nahin he
 There is not a word in this petition which is to be heard under Article 32
 vidhayakon kaa kahana he ki inhone rajyapal ko istipha diya tha jinhone ise spikar ko bheja
 It is clear in the Arunachal Pradesh Judgment that the Governor has no role
 sirf spikar kii bhoomika hoti he
 Dhawan further said that the mlas have claimed that they are voluntarily giving up their membership
 lekin unki manshaa sandigdh he
 It is the decision of the Supreme Court that if the speaker gets information about his resignation personally, then it is the responsibility of the speaker to investigate the reasons behind it
 samvidhan kii 10 ve anusuchee main is prakriya kaa puraa byora he
 Subsequently, the Supreme Court asked the lawyer of the rebel mlas Mukul Rohatgi that apart from resignation, the disqualification case was also under consideration

 What happened to the remaining eight? is par mukul rohtagi ne kaha ki do ke khilaaf farvari main karrwai shuru hui phir band kar di

 It is a matter of fact that in the by-election in Samastipur Lok Sabha constituency, Prince Raj, son of the late MP Ramchandra Paswan, riding a sympathy wave, was able to reach the Parliament
 kishanganj vidhansabha kshetra main congress ne apane loksabhaa sadsy mohammad javed kii maa saidaa bano ko tikat dekar chunavi maidan main utaara tha, lekin matadaataaon ne unhen puri tarah nakaar diya or unhen tisare sthaan par santosh karnaa padaa
 This seat was vacant only after Javed became MP

 But for JD (U), the caliphate of familism, the stakes of dynasticism backfired for themselves
 laladhari ko yahaan haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 RJD candidate Ramdev Yadav won this seat occupied by JD (U)
 siwan kii darunda vidhansabha seat par kavita singh ke pati or jad (you) ke netaa ajay singh ko bhi haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 JD (U) leader Ajay Singh was defeated by Independent candidate Karamveer Singh alias Vyas Singh in the by-election in Daronda seat after Daronda MLA Kavita Singh became MP
 is upachunaav ke parinaam ne jahaan parivaarwaad ko nakaar diya, vahiin donon gathbandhanon ko bhi kai sanket de gaya
 The ticket was given to the nda's husband Ajay Singh by not giving tickets to bjp's Siwan district vice-president Karamveer Singh on the Daronda seat
 chunaav se teen din pehle bhaajapa ne karamvir ko nilambit bhi kar diya, lekin matadaataaon ne nirdaleey pratyaashee ko pasand kar yah spasht sandesh dene kii koshish kii ki kaam karne vaale netaaon ko party jab darkinar karegi, tab matadaata use sabak bhi sikhaa sakate hai
 The same was seen in the Kishanganj assembly by-election
 yahaan bhi ek congressi netaa baghawat kar chunavi maidan main utre or congress kii haar kaa kaaran bane
 The defeat of the RJD candidate by nearly five thousand votes in Nathnagar also made it clear that the RJD was not able to succeed by bypassing its allies
 agar yahaan mahagathbandhan milakar chunaav ladi hoti or hindustani avam morcha saath hoti to donon ke maton ke saath milane ke baad parinaam kuch or hota
 Although some people are hesitant to consider this by-election to be a semi-final of next year's election, it is true that this by-election gave a lesson to both the alliances

 bharat kii pehali krichar film ‚Äòkrichar 3di‚Äô ke saath bipasha basu, bollywood kii bhi pehali e grad actress ban gai hai jinhone sabase adhik horer tathaa super nachural filmein kii hai
 Excerpts from their conversation: What is the reason for the attraction of horror films? 'creator 3D' is not a horror thriller film
 yah jurassic park, gaudzila or enakonda jaisi krichar film he
 It is my fascination, not my fascination about attraction
 isamen jo dar he vah aisa dar he jo aam taur par anjaani chizon ko lekar hota he
 Anyway, this is India's first creator film
 agar main yah film nahin karti to mujhase adhik bevakoof or koi nahin hota
 Looking at your previous horror films, now you can say that there is a victory in front of fear? Not at all, but i will still say that i am a very pony
 abhi main apni agali horer film ‚Äòalon‚Äô kii shooting kar rahi thi
 In a scene during the shooting, i lay on a couch in the dark and turn my head lightly
 jaise hi main apana sir ghumaati hum meraa saamana us bhoot se hota he jo thik mere saamne khadi hoti he
 There was only an inch gap between me and his face and according to the scene i had to shout loudly
 maine jaise hi us bhoot ko dekha main chillane lagi
 At first people thought i was acting but when they saw that i was constantly screaming, then they came to me and made me calm
 aapako jaanakar hairaani hogi ki main lagaataar 15 minute tak gahare sadame main thi
 The interesting thing is that there was a twenty two twenty three year old young girl playing the role of a ghost in the film
 usase pehali mulaakat bhi kaaphi daraavnee thi
 It happened that she was sitting somewhere in the dark and gave a smile as soon as she saw me
 aap yakeen nahin karenge ki andhere main bhoot kaa mechap lagaaye us ladkee kii hansi itani daraavnee thi ki main chinkh paddy
 However later i told that girl too that if you sit in the dark by applying such make-up, then definitely someone will have a heart attack

 Experience with Imran Abbas? Imran is a very lovely person

 jor se chillaanaa, thahaake lagaana or jor-jor se baaten karnaa meri aadat he so imran ko dekhakar mujhe laga inaki tarah shant rahaa jaae
 Not only this, i also tried to live in Tehzeeb like him for two days, but then i felt that it was not just for me haa, jab vah saath rahete to main unase kahati ki tum baaten karo kyonki unki hindi itani acchhee he ki unke saamne meri juba sil jaati thi
 He often mentioned to me the craze of Bollywood films in Pakistan and my fan following
 suna he krichar kii shooting shuru karne se pehle aap saooth ke mandiron main gai thim?ji nahin main gai nahin thi lekin haa maine unka kaaphi adhyayan kiya he

 The interesting thing is that i honestly do it at that time, but after coming home, i remember every scene of it
 phir ek ek kar puure ghar kii lite chaalu kar tej aawaaj ke saath main tivi chaalu kar leti hum
 This is the reason why i put my maid in my room
 kai baar jab zyaada dar jaati hum to apane doston yaa bahanon ko ghar bula leti hum
 Infact, this time i have told Bhushan for 'alone' that you guys should keep the sync voice because i am not going to dub

 In Gambhir's case too, Dhoni had said on the eve of the match that Gambhir's playing is also doubtful
 ham use kuch or samay denge
 It depends on how much pain he can play despite suffering
 darasal, gambhir pehle test match ke dauraan mat praayar ke shot par ghayal ho gaye the
 He was hurt on his right elbow and it is believed that he still has pain in his elbow and is not fully fit
 bharat haal main choton se jujhataa rahaa he or dhoni ne kaha ki kabhi-kabhaar hi aisa ho paaya, jabaki vah test maichon main apni majboot team utaarne main safal rahe

 This is happening continuously

 50 yaa 100 ran kii saajhedaariyon se vastav main pari ko aage badhaane main madad milegi
 "with this, it is also important for the batsmen to convert their good start into a big score
" nichle kram ke ballebaajon ko bhi apane wicket kaa mahatv samajhnaa hoga or yadi ve 40 se 60 ran bhi banaate hai, to unase kaaphi madad milegi
 Dhoni said, we have done this before and we will do our best
 bhartiya captain ne kaha ki bharat ko yadi match par dabadabaa bananaa he, to pehali pari main acha pradarshan karnaa hoga
 He said, it would be important to do well in the first innings
 dekha gaya he ki jab team team ko 100-120 ran kii badhat mil jaati he, to duusari team ke liye vaapasi karnaa bahut mushkil ho jaataa he
 India is in danger of losing the status of the world's number one Test team, but Dhoni said that they are not worried about it
 unhone kaha, yadi aap khel kaa lutf uthaate ho, to reating swayan aapaki parvaah karegi
 This is a regular process
 koi bhi hameshaa number ek nahin bane rah saktaa he
 How you get there is important
 jab aap vahaan pahunch jate hai, to use kaayam rakhana mushkil hota he
 Dhoni admitted that the team performed better as the series progressed and never really played well in the beginning
 unhone kaha, hamaare ballebaaj, gendbaaj or kshetrarakshak paristhitiyon se saamanjasy bithaane ke saath acha pradarshan karte hai

 unhone aarope lagaaya ki 'man kii baat' ke ek kaarykram ke dauraan pradhanmantri ne aashaa kaaryakarta ke bare main anbhigya hone kii baat kahi thi
 He said that he came to know the ASHA network after hearing the appreciation of the actions of ASHA workers from Bill Gates and Milinda Gates
 raghuvansh ne kaha ki yah durbhaagya or achambhit karne vaala he ki varsh 2005 main, jis samay vah gujarat ke mukhyamantri the, usee samay se aashaa kaaryakarta karyrat hai

 He said that the Center had announced doubling the income of the farmers, but their cost has gone up and the income has come down, yet the suicides committed by the farmers have not been taken into consideration

 He said that the government did not take it seriously
 saath hi unhone sarkaar ko naseehat di ki bhavishya main use aisi galati nahin kerani chahie
 Instead of criticizing the other country, one should also look at ourselves
 unhone aage kaha ki pakistan ke videsh mantralay or sarkaar ne kai galtiyaan to kii hin, lekin hamaari ore se bhi kai galati hui he
 India should not have taken it lightly
 hamen apni ore bhi dekhnaa chahie, duusare desh kii aalochana karne se kaam nahin chalegaa
 On the other hand, defense expert KK Sinha also accused the government that it could deal well on the matter
 unhone kaha, "hamen antarrashtriya str par behatar tareeke se deal karnaa chahie tha
 Pakistan is a lowly country and it always does so
 hamen to dar tha ki vahaan kii sarkaar unke saath kahin zyada bura bartaav na kar baithe
 Whatever happened to Jadhav's mother and wife was far less than our fear
 sinha kaa maananaa he ki hamako ek raashtra ke rup main apni baat majbootee ke saath rakhni chahie
 We must improve our initiative
 unhone kaha, "puure prakaran main pakistan hi sirf doshi nahin he, kuch trutiyaa hamamen bhi thi, isamen hamen or sudhaar karnaa chahie
 It is of course that the government did not make complete preparations in this matter
 "videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ke sadan main bayaan ke baad samrik visheshgy pramod paahwa ne phir sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa
 He said that Swaraj's statement was supported by all opposition parties, including the Congress
 lekin swaraj ke bhaashan main zyaadaatar ansh bhaawanaaon kaa tha, jabaki videsh niti or kootneeti bhaawanaaon par nahin chalaa karti
 The result of everything should come
 unhone kaha kijadhav maamle main hamaare paas puure subutahain or apni baat pramukhataa se rakhi jaani chahie
 He claims that the government looked overly soft on this case, it is provoking public sentiments
 apane bhaashan main unhone ninda karne ke alaava or kuch thos baat nahin kahi
 Initially it was okay, India's attitude: Sinha also looked a little annoyed with the government's attitude, although he said that the most important thing in the whole case is that Kulbhushan Jadhav is still alive
 unhone kaha ki report ke aadhaar par lagata he ki jadhav kii maansik sthiti thik nahin he
 They have been tortured there
 bharat ne cese ke shuruyaat main sabase acchhee baat yahi kahi ki jadhav ko apana naagarik mana
 Accused him of being implicated in the espionage case
 tab bharat ne dhamkee bhi di thi ki agar jadhav ke saath kuch anhoni hui to use murder samajha jayega
 Sinha believes that India should avenge it
 jaruri nahin ki ladaai ke jariye hi samaadhaan nikaala jaae
 India should create 20 such opportunities, so that Pakistan can be put under pressure
 paahwa ne bhi kaha ki pakistan ek dhoort desh he or uske saath vaisaa hi vyavhaar karnaa chahie jaisaa wo hamaare saath kar rahaa he
 It will work only if we answer India in that language
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne sadan main bayaan dete hue daawa kiya ki bharat ke dabaav ke kaaran pakistan is mulaakaat ko raji hua tha
 But Jadhav's mother-wife was treated abusively in Pakistan
 unhone talkh lahaze main kaha ki desh pakistan ke is apmaan ko bardaasht nahin karegaa
 Amid the controversy over recent visits, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had on Friday asked the Chief Secretary and other senior officials not to make special arrangements for him and staff during such visits
 is sambandh main shuukravaar ko mukhyamantri offis se aadesh jari kiye the
 It was said in the order that 'we are people sitting on the ground, so no special arrangements should be made
 mukhyamantri tabhi sammaan ke liye yogya honge jab rajya ke log sammanit mahasooss karenge
 'not even 24 hours have passed that the order was put on hold by the authorities
 darasal hua yun ki uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ravivaar ko elahabaad ke swaruparani nehru aspataal kaa nirikshan karne pahunche
 On getting information about the visit of Chief Minister Yogi, Allahabad district administration hired 20 coolers from a tent house on Saturday night and got them installed in the ward of the patients, but as soon as Yogi finished the inspection on Sunday, all the coolers were removed
 cooler ko aspataal se hataane kii photo sthaneey cameraman ne apane camere main darj kar lee
 When questioned by reporters, it was found out that the coolers were rented from the local tent house
 aspataal main bhartee ek marij ke parijan ajay singh ne bataaya, "siem yogi adityanath ke aane par hame cooler kii hawa mili lekin unke jate hi cooler bhi hawa ho gaye
 Coolers were ordered on Saturday
 yah sab siem ko khush karne ke liye tha
 " mukhya chikitsa adhikari karunaakar dvivedi ne bataaya, "aspataal main hamaare paas 75 se 80 cooler hai jinhen ward main lagaaya gaya he
 Yesterday one or two coolers were not working and the technical incharge asked CM Yogi Adityanath to get them replaced before arrival
 hamane haa kar diya
 It is not true that we had ordered 20 coolers

 Actually, it happened that Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath came to inspect Swarooprani Nehru Hospital in Allahabad on Sunday
 elahabaad jila prashasan ne mukhyamantri yogi ke daure kii jaankaree milte hi shanivaar raat ko ek tent house se 20 cooler kiraaye par le kar marijon ke ward main lagava die gaye lekin jaise hi ravivaar ko yogi nirikshan khatm kar aspataal se gaye, sabhi cooler hataa liye
 The photo of the removal of the cooler from the hospital was recorded by the local cameraman in his camera
 patrakaron dwaara sawaal kiye jane par pataa chalaa ki cooler sthaneey tent house se kiraaye par lekar lagaae gaye the
 Ajay Singh, the family of a patient admitted in the hospital, said, "on arrival of CM Yogi Adityanath, we got cooler air but as soon as he went, the cooler air also got
 cooler shanivaar ko mangaaye gaye the
 This was all to please the CM

 India: 3500+ Overseas: 1000 Worldwide total: 4500+ screens # TZH The action taken on the Valmiki colony to widen the road in Rampur in Uttar Pradesh has started taking political color
 puraa maamla tab shuru hua, jab shahar ke bichombich atikaramit zamin par based valmiki pariwaron ke gharon ko shopping complex ke liye jane vaali ek sadak banane ke liye todane kii baat kahi gai
 These people were also asked to provide houses under Kanshi Ram Awas Yojana, but these people do not want to go there, because that place is away from the city and they have been living here for the last 50 years
 saamaajik kaaryakarta shabnam hashmi ne ek dailygation ke saath us jagah kaa daura kiya
 Members of this team interacted with the people and administration of Valmiki society
 ye zamin nagarpalika kii he, jis par valmiki samaaj ke log 50 saal se based hue hai
 Administrative officials have asked the team not to evacuate the house from these people
 shabnam ke mutabik, jamini halaat kaa jaeza lene ke baad un logon ko laga ki is sab vivaad ke peeche rajnatik logon kaa haath tha, jo hindu-musalmaan kaa jhagada paidaakar maahaul karaab karnaa chaahate the
 NDTV has come to know that some local leaders and media persons also instigated those sitting on hunger strike with their demands
 in logon ne kathith taur par kaha ki agar aap aisi baat bologe ki aap logon par dharm parivartan kaa dabaav he, to ye ek rajnatik maamla ban jayega or aapke ghar batch jaaenge
 The talk of conversion has been raised by some to spoil the social and communal atmosphere
 asal main jin gharon par nishaan lagane kii baat kahi gai he wo nagarpalika dwaara 9 maheene pehle hi lagaai gai thi, un gharon ko chinhit karne ke liye jo nagarpalika kii zamin par bane hue the
 On the other hand there are houses of Muslims, they were already marked on them
 us vakshe kaafii virodh hone ke kaaran valmikiyon ke gharon par nishaan nahin lage the
 Shabnam said that this is being done as part of a plan to expand the city, in which the houses of both Hindus and Muslims have been demolished, so the communal color that is being tried to give this case, it is anti-social There is protection against the elements
 jo log is maamle ko rashtriya str par sampradayik or dharmik rang dena chaahate hai vahi inhen dharm badalane kaa laalach de rahe hai
 According to Shabnam, the whole matter is to be settled through dialogue between the administration and the people
 valmiki samaaj ke logon ne kaha ki yahaan parking complekas ban rahaa he, lekin is dailygation dwaara pataa karne par pataa chalaa ki maamla wo bhi nahin he, baat sirf itani he ki jo garib aadmi he, use mukhyadhara se uthaakar dur phenkane kii niti chal rahi he, jiskaa sabhi virodh karte hai
 The mindset behind this entire campaign is to throw away the poor, not to discriminate against them in the name of religion
 unhone kaha ki ise dharmik or sampradayik mudda vahaan baithe kuch asaamaajik or sampradayik tatwon ne banaaya he
 If the administration wants to remove them, they can easily make their way to the shopping complex, there is so much space there
 shabnam ke mutabik, "valmiki samaaj ke logon kaa kahana he ki dharm parivartan kii baat us vyakti ne kii thi, jo unke ghar nishaan lagane aayaa tha, jo zaahir he ek chota karmchaaree hoga
 The person who has done this protection can neither put pressure on it to do anything like this, nor give any assurance
 sthaneey dm se uski shikaayat kar di gai he, jiske baad unhone uske kilaaf kadam uthaane kaa bhi aashwaasan diya he

 Samajwadi Party has increased the difficulties of Congress by releasing the list of 191 candidates
 saharanpur, gajiabad, noida, bulandshahr or mathura jaise jilon main kai siton par congress majboot thi
 In many of these seats, the Congress also had its own mlas
 samaajawaadee party ne bigaada khellekin ab samaajawaadee party ne aisi kai siton par ummidavaar utaare hai jahaan se congress jeet kii ummid kar sakati thi
 This decision has come so long that the Congress has no special option now
 kehane ko to party ab bhi aisi siton par pratyaashee utaar sakati he lekin unamem ab naa to pehle jaisaa josh hoga or naa hi janata unhen lekar khaas garmjoshi dikhaaegi
 Le haste, another one, where Akhilesh Yadav, like his father, shocked the Congress by playing shocking political bets
 duusari ore, congress ke maujuuda karnadhaaron ne us ehtiyaat ko baratna jaruri nahin samajha jo sonia gandhi samaajawaadee party ko lekar do dashakon se dikhaati aa rahi thim
 Sonia Gandhi has ensured on many occasions that either the Congress will not have any relationship with the Samajwadi Party or they will decide the terms of the alliance themselves
 apane haathon ganvaai bajicongress ne upi chunaav ke liye muhim kaa aagaaj '27 saal, upi behaal' ke naare ke saath kiya tha
 Rahul Gandhi traveled from village to village for a month and promised farmers a loan waiver
 unki yatra ne kai aise sthaneey netaaon kaa dhyaan khinchaa jinhen duusari partiyon main ahmiyat nahin mil paa rahi thi
 At the same time, the slain Congress workers also started coming into action
 lekin jaise hi lagane laga ki party main kuch jaan foonki ja sakati he, party ke bheetar akhilesh yadav ke saath gathbandhan kii baat uchhaali jane lagi
 The party removed Nirmal Khatri, the opponent of this alliance, from the position of state president and handed over the command to the old socialist Raj Babbar
 congressi karnadhaaron kaa badla manasiosi pandit maanate hai ki shuruaati mehnat ke baad party ke chunaav abhiyaan kii kaman sambhaal rahe prashanth kishor bhi gathbandhan kii ore jhukate dikhe
 The same can be said of Raj Babbar and Ghulam Nabi Azad
 inhen logon kaa dabaav rahul gandhi ko is gathbandhan ke liye manaane main ahm sabit hua
 The day the Prashant Kishore was seen coming out of Mulayam Singh's Delhi house in a long car, the Congressmen started getting very upset
 jaise chunaav paas aata gaya congress or janata ne yah maan liya ki gathbandhan ho rahaa he
 In this situation, all the Congress candidates and workers sat at home
 sirf vahi congressi khush rahe jinhen tikat kii ummid thi
 Prior to every election, now before every election, Congress used to get some people with mass support who were disappointed with other parties
 inhen logon kii badaulat congress pichley dhai dashakon se 25-30 siten jeet paa rahi thi
 The biggest disadvantage of coalition speculation is that this time Congress is unable to find such leaders
 yah asar yaheen khatm ho jaataa to bhi ganimat thi
 But the UP election is being considered as the semi-final of the next general election
 prashanth kishor kii team ne jin hajaaron logon ko tikat kii ummid dilaai wo ab 2019 main congress kaa daaman thaamne se pehle kai baar sochenge
 The Congress, entangled in the temptation of surrogate rents, except the ground battle, has become a big fuss in Uttar Pradesh
 bhartiya press parishad ke adhyaksh nyaayamurti markendeya katjune daawa kiya ki bharat kii janata bhed-bakriyon kii tarah matdaan karti he
 Katju also said that he would not vote in elections because it is 'meaningless' in a situation when the feudals have abducted democracy
 ‚Äòhedlins today‚Äô se baatcheet main katju ne kaha ki 90 fisadi bhartiya bhed-bakriyon kii tarah jhund main matdaan karte hai
 They are like a flock of sheep who vote on the basis of caste and religion
 yah ek kadavi sachai he or chunki bharat kii janata pashudhan kii tarah matdaan karti he, lihaaja sansad main itane apradhi hai
 Katju's appeal, apology to Sanjay Dutt, said that i will not vote because my vote is meaningless
 hamaara loktantr ab bhi sankraman kaal se guzar rahaa he or saamanton ne use agava kar liya he
 Voting is done by looking at the names of Jats, Muslims, Yadavs or Harijans
 loktantr is tarah chalane ke liye nahin he
 My one vote will not make any difference
 jaanwaron kii jhund main shaamil hokar main apana vakt bhala kyon barbaad karun?supreme court ke purv nyaayadhish katju ne kaha ki yahaan tak ki vakil or professor jaise samaaj ke sambhraat log bhi jati aadhaar par vot daalate hai or unhone elahabaad baar or vishvavidhyalay main aisa hote dekha he
 Jaitley should retire from politics: Katju said that i am a completely secular person and if i am called a Congressman if i am secular, then you are free to have such an attitude
 main sampradayik takaton ke khilaaf hum
 This is a country of diversity and if we do not take everyone along, we cannot live for a day

 surakshabalon ne chhattisgarh, maharashtra, jharkhand or telugana jaise alag-alag rajyon main naksaliyon ke khilaaf chalaae ja rahe 'oparation prahaar' ke baad badi sankhya main naksaliyon ko dher kiya he
 On the other hand, there is such information that the Naxalite organizations, which are troubled by the decreasing number of members, are now trying to involve the youth in their groups on the pretext of dance

 is bhartee abhiyaan main yuvaaon ko rijhaane ke liye dance program kaa bhi aayojan kar rahe he
 According to the information, when naive tribal people especially youths gather to watch the dance program, the Naxalite commander who is a part of the PLGA, brainwashes them
 jiske baad kai yuva naksali banane ke liye taiyaar ho jate hai
 The Naxalinxli commanders, who have been falling short of continuous operations, are presently terrified by the 'operation Prahar' of the security forces in Naxalbari area

 Naxalites engaged in providing gorilla training is the reason that Naxalite commanders are now engaged in making Naxalites and guerrilla training to the innocent youths in the forests of Malkangiri, Rayagada and Kalahandi in Odisha
 haalanki is input ke baad suraksha balon ko yah nirdesh die gaye hai ki naksaliyon ke is bhartee abhiyaan ko har haal main vifal kiya jaae
 The security forces, which are currently working in these Naxalite areas, have started monitoring the arrival and recruitment operations of the Naxalites and their commanders on the basis of this instruction

 In Shamli in western Uttar Pradesh, farmers have been staging a sit-in for the last 5 days
 colectrate par baithe kisaanon kaa kahana he ki sarkaar unki baat ko nahin sun rahi he
 Sugarcane farmers demand that Rs 80 crore of last year's sugarcane crop and this year's amount be paid
 kisaanon ne bhugtan raashi nahin milane par badi sankhya main dharm parivartan karne kii baat kahi he
 Actually, according to the rule of the government, the farmers have to pay the amount of sugarcane in 14 days and on getting late, the mill owners start charging interest from the farmers
 haalanki, abhi to kisaanon ko byaaj to dur pichley saal kaa mul bhi nahin mila he
 This is the reason why farmers are sitting on dharna
 sarkaar ke dhyaan ko apni ore khinchne ke liye kisaan kai prakaar tareeke bhi apanaate dikhe rahe hai
 However, they are still not being heard
 dharna-pradarshan ke tisare din kisaanon ne sir mudwakar virodh jataayaa tha
 At the same time, on the fourth day i
e
 Saturday, Muslim farmers read Namaz at the protest site
 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki ganna ugane vaale kisaan pareshaan hai
 His last season's money has not been received yet
 unka kahana he ki sarkaar ne 14 dinon main ganne kaa bhugtan karne kaa vaada kiya tha lekin paisa abhi tak nahin mila he
 The problem of farmers is not limited to sugarcane
 unhone bataaya ki bachade khet kii fasal ko puri tarah se nasht kar de rahe hai
 Power companies are suing them
 unka kahana he ki agar sarkaar unki maangon ko nahin maanati he to 21 janvari ko sabhi kisaan shamali main ek mahapanchayat bulaayenge
 Also, the farmers said that if the demands are not met, we can also take a step of conversion
 dharne par baithe jitendra naam ke kisaan ne kaha ki unhen na to pichley saal kaa ganne kaa bhugtan mila he or na hi is saal kaa
 He said that 80 crore rupees of farmers are stuck
 wo kehete hai ki ham court ke aadesh kaa ulanghan nahin karnaa chaahate, isliye ham 14 din ke pement ko chhod rahe hai or chaahate hai bachi raashi ko hamen bhugtan kiya jaae
 Jitendra told that the officials came to the dharna site and said that take 7 crore rupees which is the payment amount for this year's sugarcane and finish the dharna
 unhone kaha, 'hamane pichley saal ganne kii fasal ke liye logon se udhaar liya tha
 In such a situation what will happen to us from 7 crores, what will we pay and what will we save
 ' jitendra ne kaha ki jab tak unhen khate main paise ke jamaa hone kaa massej nahin milegaa wo log dharna khatm nahin karenge
 The ADM, who reached the midst of the dharna, talked about the payment of 7 crore to the farmers first and then 10 crore
 lekin kisaanon ne is raashi ko lene se inkaar kar diya
 They say that this will be the amount for this year, then what is the outstanding of 80 crore last year? At the same time, the farmers warned to continue the picket till all the payments were not made
 bataa den ki jila prashasan kii ore se gharna-sthal par ediem kebi singh, esadm prashanth singh, edisnal espi ajay pratap singh bhi pahunche
 During this, he also got the farmers to talk to the mill management, but the farmers remained firm on their demands

 After meeting you, pressure on you said that i have full sympathy with you, Parrikar

 Due to this pressure, i am calling you a liar while taking such a big step to show my loyalty to PM

 The opposition has once again dispersed in Narendra Modi's saffron tsunami
 bijepi akele dam par 300+ pahunch gai he to vahiin endie kaa aankada 340 ke paar he
 The largest opposition party, Congress, has suffered a major setback once again
 congress ek baar phir 50 ke aankade main simatati hui dikh rahi he
 In such a situation, the same question has been raised again, which was for the last five years
 kya is baar congress ko loksabhaa main vipakshi netaa kaa tamgaa milegaa?pichhali loksabhaa main vipaksh ke netaa rahe mallikarjun khadge bhi chunaav haar gaye hai

 jiske baad ab sawaal he ki is baar vipaksh kaa netaa koun banegaa, kya congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi khud ye jimmedaari sanbhaalenge
 This question is arising because in the trends, the Congress has barely reached the 50 mark
 or loksabhaa main vipaksh ke netaa kaa pad lene ke liye 10 fisadi siten chahie
 That is, it is necessary to have a total of 55 seats out of 543 Lok Sabha seats, only then a party gets the post of opposition leader
 kyonki is baar ke congress ke jo adhiktar saansad jeet ke aa rahe hai, wo kerala or punjab se hai
 That is, it can be difficult for them to find a face who is able to speak Hindi language and can speak to a large section of people
 2014 main bhi kuch aisa hi hua tha, jab congress maatr 44 siton par simat gai thi
 Even then the Congress did not get this position
 loksabhaa main congress ke netaa bane mallikarjun khadge is pad ke liye puure paanch saal ladate rahe, lekin nahin mil sakaa
 Many times he had also requested the Narendra Modi government of the Center to give this post
 lekin aisa nahin ho sakaa
 Let us know that after 2014, the Congress has also suffered a big setback
 rahul gandhi kii aguwai main congress ne narendra modi ko nishaanaa banaaya tha, lekin janata modi ke saath dikhi
