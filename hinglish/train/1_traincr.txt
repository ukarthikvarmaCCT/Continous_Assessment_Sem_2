 bhartiya rigerv bank ke governor raghuram rajan ne haal hi main bhartraam smarak vyaakhyaan ke dauraan ek ajeeb baat kahi
 He was of the opinion that the "movement" of the world economy is slower than ever and limited to our markets, so we have to focus on regional and domestic demands for our growth
 unka aashay yah tha ki ‘‘mek in india’’ kaa lakshya mukhya rup se desi bazaar ko bananaa hoga
 Rajan thus rejected the concept of export-oriented growth for the country
 unki peshkash kii ek daleel yah bhi nikalati he ki bade paimaane par utpaadan ‘‘mek in india’’ abhiyaan kaa aadhaar nahin ho saktaa
 Of course, mainstream economists hardly disagree with Rajan's policy recommendations
 niryaat par sabsidi dena niryatonmukhi vikaas ko badhaava dene kaa behatar tarika nahin ho saktaa
 Anyway, the World Trade Organization has banned such subsidies
 isi tarah vyapaar par tamaam bandishon ke saath aayaat aadhaarit audyogikeekaran bhi behatar upaay nahin he
 Indeed, i would go a step further and offer to resume trade liberalization, which has been stalled since 2007–08, when revenue targets began to decline
 baharhaal, rajan yahaan ek ahm sawaal ko nazarandaaj kar rahe hai
 That question is, how can India with the abundance of labor force survive the path of industrial change on which every successful economy with abundant labor force has adopted it? There is an army of about 50 crores of people working in India at present and 1 in it every year
 2 karod kaa ijapha ho rahaa he
 Even now being poor, the country has a limited stock of capital and most of the labor force is unskilled
 in halaat main ham rojgaar kii baat joh rahe logon ko bade paimaane par kaise achche rojgaar de paaenge? aaj, kareeb aadhi shram-shakti krishi par aadhaarit he, jiskaa rashtriya sakal gharelu utpaada (jidipi) main yogadan 15 fisadi se kam he
 In addition, more than 40 percent of the labor force is engaged in the unorganized sector
 in paristhitiyon main kya koi aisa rasta he jo baari shram-shakti kii khapat vaale sile-silaae kapadon jaise udyog or nirmaan jaise seva kshetra se na gujarata ho, phir bhi agle dashak main kareeb ek-tihaai shram-shakti ke liye nijee kshetra main behatar naukariyon kaa srijan kar sake? rajan is raste ke bare main vistaar se nahin bataate or main bhi us bare main nahin soch paa rahaa hum
 Many people in India think that the country will jump from the production sector to the status of a service sector economy like the US
 unhen yah ehsaas nahin he ki dashakon tak awwal darje kii oonchi talim ke baad hi ham america kii tarah ke kaam karne vaale log hasil kar sakate hai
 At present, more jobs in the services sector are in the low paid and unorganized sector
 2006-07 ke rashtriya namoona surveykshan main pataa chalaa tha ki seva kshetra ke 1
 Out of the 626 largest companies in 5 crore, 38% provide services and interestingly, only 2% of them are engaged in labor force
 yah bhi ek badi galatfahami-si paidaa ho gai he ki niryaat sirf tej vruddhi vaali vishwa arthvyavastha main hi teji se bad saktaa he
 The fact is that between 1995 and 2013, when China's exports were booming, it was just 1 in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries
 4 fisadi salanaa kii dar sehi bad rahaa tha
 In theory, during slow global growth, growth in exports is hampered only when many countries are producing the same goods at the same time
 haalanki is tarah ke halaat kabhi banate nahin
 In history, there have been only a handful of developing countries that have achieved the goal of simultaneous increase in exports of heavy labor-intensive products
 1960 or 1970 ke dashak main aise desh dakshin korea, taiwan, singapore or honkong rahe hai
 Then, as salaries increased in these East Asian lions, they were replaced by China in the 1980s
 or ab jab china main tankhwaahen bad gayi hai to in utpaadon ke pratispardhi niryaatkon main vietnam or cambodia ko ubharate dekha ja saktaa he
 Rajan is right to say that two economies like China cannot be in place in the world, but this cannot be true in the case of India becoming a successful exporter
 aaj china kaa niryaat duniya ke vyapaar kaa 12 fisadi he or bharat kaa 2 fisadi se bhi kam
 But, with a huge labor force and relatively low salaries, why can't India beat China by about 2 percentage points in the next five years? Just this can give a lot of support to the "make in India" campaign for the global economy
 agar ham bada sapana nahin dekhenge to ham duniya main shram-shakti aadhaarit utpaadon ke bazaar main paith nahin bana sakate
 Considering Rajan's pessimism about exports, it is no surprise that Rajan's long list of reforms in the old labor laws has no mention, which is very important to give us an edge in the production sector
 aise main niryaat ko lekar hamaara nirashavad apni bhaawanaaon ko tusht karne kaa saadhan hi banataa he or ham vishwa bazaar main hode karne kii apni nitigat naakaamiyon ko na samajhane kii galatfahami ke shikaar ho jate hai, or is tathy ko nazarandaaj kar jate hai ki isi bazaar main china sab kuch hathiyaata ja rahaa he

 High speed havoc is seen daily in the country's capital, now the occurrence of car and bike stunts has also become common
 pichley dinon civil lines main hue haadase se na car chaalkon or dilli trephic police or dilli police ne kuch nahin siikhaa
 In the midst of a passerby program, the fatal stunters were immersed in the fun of passersby at Connaught Place, Delhi, free of the odd even formula

 Congress President Sonia Gandhi told her party people in two words today that due to indiscipline, personal ambitions and important, we have missed many such opportunities which the countrymen wanted to give us
 sonia ne congress ke do divasiy chintan shivi main apane praarambhik bhaashan main partygen se sawaal kiya, kya aisa nahin he ki hamane sirf is vajah se aise kai avasar ganvaa die hai, jo deshvasi hamen dena chaahate hai kyonki ham ek anushaasit or sangathit team kii tarah kaam karne main naakaam rahe hai
 He said that in those states where we do not have governments, we should immediately unite, forgetting our personal ambitions and importance, so that the party wins
 ham ye kyon bhul jate hai ki party kii jeet hi ham sabaki jeet he
 Sonia said that our achievements have a full history
 samaaj ke sabhi varg hamase jude hai
 We raise the voice for the interests and concerns of all sections, especially the weaker sections' Dalit tribal minorities and women
 unhone kaha ki hamane hameshaa kisaanon or khetihar mazdooron ke hiton kii aguwai kii he
 An inclusive approach is not a political ploy for us to win elections and run a government
 yah samavesh hamaari vichaardhaara kaa sambal he
 This is not the result of any compulsion, like some of our opponents are
 sonia ne kaha ki ekta badi-badi baton kaa elaan karne se nahin aati
 It must come from within us
 hamaare is mahaan sanghathan kaa har ek kaaryakarta aaj ekta ke liye pareshaan he or hamaara ferj banataa he ki ham uski yah maang puri karen
 He said that we have to develop leadership at all levels
 aisa netritv jo prabhavi ho, aage badhane se na daren or logon kii aakankshaon or sarokaaron se jude muddon ko jor-shor se uthaaen
 Those doing good work in the party should get opportunities to grow on the strength of their work, not under anyone's umbrella
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki jaipur kaa ye shivi panchmadi or shimla main hui baithkon se do tarah se alag he
 The first thing is that we are meeting at a time when we have been in government for almost nine years at the Center
 isi tarah is samay ham kai rajyon main sarkaar main nahin hai or aise kai rajyon main kadi chunautiyon kaa saamana kar rahe hai jo hamaare puraane garh maane jate hai
 Secondly, in the last nine years, huge economic development, social changes and new discoveries of technology have come out
 nai apekshaaon kii lahar dikhaai de rahi he
 There is a need for new accountability for this
 shivi main is baar badi sankhya main yuvaaon kii shirkat par tippanee karte hue unhone kaha, is shivi main ek or nayaa aayam bhi saaf dikhaayi de rahaa he
 a significant number of the participants here are representatives of the new generation
 isamen hamaari praathamikta or desh kii aabaadi ke badale swaroop or usamen yuvaaon kii sahi tasviir milti he
 On the challenges the Congress is facing in many states including the Center, Sonia said, "although we are still the most prominent political power in the country, but we must also accept that we have a tough competition and which were our areas of support by tradition, Others have also made their way there
 unhone kaha ki kai rajyon main ham lambey arase se sarkaar se baahar hai lekin, main maanati hum ki sirf satta main bane rahanaa hi hamaari raajnneeti kaa kul makasad nahin he, phir bhi iskaa ulataa asar hamaare manobal or sanghathan par padataa hi he
 Regarding the alliance, Sonia said that in the states where we have alliances, we have to strike a balance between the spirit of the alliance and the party's tenacity so that the organization gets more energy
 tippaniyan Referring to corruption, he said that our citizens are justified by seeing corruption at the highest level of public life
 unhone kaha ki yah thik hi he ki rosemara kii jindagi main faile bhrashtachar se tang hai
 This is a reality, a churn, we should understand it
 iskaa hal nikaalkar jawaab dena chahie 
 The Congress President said that how could it be that we let our growing educated and middle class get confused and cut off from the political process
 unhone sabhi pratinidhiyon se kaha ki ve shivi main saaf-saaf or khulkar apni baaten rakhen, kyonki ham yahaan gambhir chintan ke liye aae hai, jisase hamaara bhavishya tay hoga
 When we go from here, we should have a clear and complete goal
 hamen yahaan se nai urja or takat ke saath janaa he or sidhe kaam main jute janaa he
 Sonia, in her opening speech at the Congress two-day Thinking Camp, questioned the partymen, is it not that we have missed so many opportunities that the countrymen want to give us because we like a disciplined and organized team Have failed to work
 unhone kaha ki un rajyon main jahaan hamaari sarkarein nahin hai, vahaan hamen apni nijee mahatvakankshaon or ahm ko bhulaakar fouran ekajute hona chahie, jisase party kii jeet ho
 Why do we forget that the victory of the party is the victory of all of us
 sonia ne kaha ki hamaari uplabdhiyon kaa ek bharaa puraa itihaas he
 All sections of society are connected to us
 ham sabhi virgon’ ke hiton or chintaaon ke liye aawaaj buland karte hai, khaskar kamjor virgon’ jaise dalit adivasee alpsankhyak or mahilaayein
 He said that we have always led the interests of farmers and agricultural laborers
 sabakaa samaveshi drushtikon hamaare liye sirf chunaav jeetne or sarkaar chalaane kii koi raajnneetik chaal nahin he
 This inclusion is the strength of our ideology
 yah kisi majaburi kaa nateeja nahin he, jaise hamaare kuch virodhiyon ke liye he
 Sonia said that unity does not come from announcing big things
 ye hamaare bheetar se aani chahie
 Every single worker of this great organization is worried for unity today and it is our duty to fulfill this demand
 unhone kaha ki hamen sabhi staron par netritv kaa vikaas karnaa he
 Leadership that is effective, do not be afraid to move forward and loudly raise issues related to people's aspirations and concerns
 party main acha kaam karne waalon ko apane kaam ke bal par upar badhane ke avasar milane chahien, kisi kii chhatrachhaaya main nahin
 The Congress President said that this Jaipur camp is different from the meetings held in Panchmarhi and Shimla
 pehali baat to ye ki ham ek aise samay main mil rahe hai jab ham kendra main kareeb nau saal se sarkaar main hai
 Similarly, at this time we are not in government in many states and are facing tough challenges in many states which are considered our old strongholds
 duusari baat ye ki pichley nau saal main baari aarthik vikaas, saamaajik badlaav or takanic kii nai khoj saamne ai hai
 a wave of new expectations is visible
 iske liye nai javabdehi kii jarurat he
 Commenting on the participation of a large number of youths in the camp this time, he said, another new dimension is also clearly visible in this camp
 yahaan hissaa lene waalon main acchhee khaasi sankhya nai peedi ke pratinidhiyon kii he
 In this, our priority and the changed nature of the country's population and the right picture of youth is found in it
 congress ko kendra sahit kai rajyon main mil rahi chunautiyon par sonia ne kaha, vaise ham ab bhi desh kii sabase pramukh raajnneetik shakti hai, lekin hamen ye bhi sweekaar karnaa chahie ki hamaare saamne muqabla kadaa he or jo parampara se hamaare samarthan ke kshetra the, vahaan dusron ne bhi apni jagah banaai he
 He said that in many states we have been out of the government for a long time, but i believe that staying in power is not the only objective of our politics, yet it has the opposite effect on our morale and organization
 gathbandhan ke bare main sonia ne kaha ki jin rajyon main hamaare gathbandhan hai, vahaan hamen gathbandhan kii bhaavana or party kii dridhtaa ke bich santulan banaakar chalanaa he taaki sanghathan ko adhik urja mil sake
 The comments bhrashtachar kaa ullekh karte hue unhone kaha ki hamaare naagarik saarvajanik jivan ke oonche str par bhrashtachar dekhakar jaij taur par ajiz aa gaye hai
 He said that it is right that we are fed up with corruption spread in everyday life
 ye ek hakeekat he, ek manthan he, ise hamen samajhnaa chahie
 It should be solved and answered
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki ye kaise ho saktaa he ki ham apane badhate hue shikshit or madhya varg ko bhramit hokar raajnneetik prakriya se katkar alag-thalag hone den
 He asked all the delegates to keep their talks clearly and openly in the camp, because we have come here for serious thinking, which will determine our future
 jab ham yahaan se jaaen to hamaare saamne ek spasht or puraa lakshya hona chahie
 We have to go from here with new energy and strength and get directly involved in the work
 sonia ne kaha ki hamaari uplabdhiyon kaa ek bharaa puraa itihaas he

 Do these remedies to please Lord Vishnu - Wear a yellow cloth after a bath on Thursday
 - bhagwaan vishnu kii vidhivat puja karen
 - Use yellow flowers in worship
 - bhagwaan vishnu ke saamne ghi kaa deepak jalaaen

 US President Obama has called India's Prime Minister Reformer in Chief
 to jo naukari sikar in nid he use kya kaha jaae

 It is not necessary that jobs will also increase if GDP increases
 manmohan kaal ke kuch khandon ko isiilie jobles growth kaha jaataa he
 What would you like the GDP to increase or jobs to increase? Vivek Kaul reports that NITI Aayog vice chairman Arvind Panagariya has accused the Indian industry of investing less in an industry that requires more workers
 bharat main har maheene das lakh log job market main aate hai lekin naukari to sirf lakh do lakh ko hi mil rahi he

 In India, 90 percent of the people in this sector work in small companies while in China 87 percent of the workers work in medium and big companies
 isliye ab ve udyog jagat ko cheta rahe hai ki rojgaar srijan ke kshetra main nivesh karen

 Labor laws need to be debated separately, but Pangarhia says that the central and state governments have jointly enacted some 200 types of labor laws, due to which textile companies in India do not want to be big and big industrialists do not want to come in this sector
 bharat main is sector main 90 pratishat log choti companiyon main kaam karte hai jabaki china main 87 pratishat mazdoor majhole or badi companiyon main kaam karte hai
 Therefore, they are now warning the industry to invest in the field of job creation

 In today's busy life, we just cannot find time for ourselves
 ham har kaam kaa tanaav lete hai or phir depressant kaa shikaar ho jate hai
 After this, to get relief from depression, we take different types of medicines
 bataa den, in dawaaiyon kii jagah agar aap din main sirf 15 minute jogging karenge yaa kuch or shaareerik vyaayaam karenge, to aapako depressant kii samasya nahin hogi
 This is not the case, but in a new study report
 masachusets general aspataal ne ek study kii he jisamen ye pataa chalaa he ki agar ham log sirf 15 minute jogging karenge to depressant hone kaa khatra kaaphi kam ho jayega
 If not jogging, then some physical exercise is necessary
 is study ke mukhya shodhakarta da
 David says, 'whenever a patient comes to us complaining of depression, we inspire them to take a little walk, gardening instead of medicine
 ' unhone is baat par bhi jor diya ki 15 minute kii jogging yaa kuch or shaareerik kaam ke baad hamaara heart 50 pratishat or tej pump karnaa chahie
 David calls it Sweet Spot
 udhaaharan ke liye agar eksrasij se pehle aapaki heart rate 60 thi, to eksrasij ke baad ye 90 ho jaani chahie
 Let us tell you, 611,583 people were part of this study
 uname se kuch logon ko excelerometer pahanaae gaye the, vahiin kuch ne apane physical work kii self reporting kii thi
 This experiment made sense that people who wore accelerometers and exercised also had a lower risk of depression than those who did not wear accelerometers
 study se ye bhi saaf ho gaya he ki aapke dine (dna)kaa depressant se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 Even if your parents have a problem of depression, it does not mean that you too will suffer from it
 agar aap apni sehat kaa khyaal rakhegein or 15 minute jogging yaa kuch or shaareerik kaam karenge to aapako depressant hone kaa khatra kam he
 For information, let us see that depression has emerged as a major problem in America, UK and India and many people are suffering from it
 akele america main 16 million se zyada log depressant se peedit he

 sena pramukh general ve ke singhki ummid ke khilafasupreme courtne unki aayu ke mudde parasarkaarake faisle ko sahi tehraaya
 The Supreme Court said that he cannot reject his commitment to accept his date of birth on 10 May 1950
 iske chalate sena pramukh ko apni yachika waapas lene ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 The Supreme Court said that it was not in favor of hearing General Singh's plea
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki sarkari dastavejon main unki janmatithi ko 10 may 1951 mana jaye
 The apex court gave him the option to withdraw the petition
 nyaayalay ne vyavastha di ki general singh ke saath koi purvaagrah nahin kiya gaya he tathaa unki janmatithi ke bare main sarkaar kaa nirnay prabhavi rahegaa
 In view of this opinion, General Singh will now have to retire on 31 May this year
 sheersh nyaayalay ne dhyaan dilaayaa ki sarkaar kaa un par purna bharosa he tathaa nyaayalay yah sunishchit karnaa chahta he ki vah sena pramukh kii tarah kaam karnaa jari rakhen jaisaa ki vah abhi kar rahe hai
 In a packed court room that lasted for two hours, the apex court said that General Singh should honor his commitment and those letters written in 2008 and 2009 and accept his date of birth on 10 May 1950
 bhojanavkaash ke baad dopaher do baje nyaayalay kii sunwaayee phir shuru hone par general singh ne antat: apni yachika ko waapas le liya
 Earlier, at the commencement of hearing, Attorney General GE Vahanvati informed the court that the government had withdrawn its order dated 30 December 2011 in which General Singh's statutory complaint on age issue was dismissed
 isi ke saath vaahnavati ne spasht kar diya ki sarkaar pichley saal july main kiye gayi apane is nirnay par atal he ki unki janmatithi 10 may 1950 he
 a bench headed by Justice RM Lodha posed tough questions to General Singh about why he did not get the documents repaired
 sheersh nyaayalay ne kaha ki sena dwaara 10 may 1950 ko unki janmatithi ke rup main pahchaan kiya janaa na to koi vikruti he or na hi isamen koi badi truti hui he
 The bench said that when General Singh joined the Indian Military Academy and the National Defense Academy, the documents in which his date of birth was 10 May 1950 were accessible to him
 supreme court kii peeth main nyaayamurti ech el gokhale bhi shaamil the
 The bench told General Singh that after making a commitment to follow the government's decision and given assurances, he cannot reject it
 usne kaha ki sarkaar kaa sena pramukh ke rup main un par purna vishwaas he tathaa unke prati koi purvaagrah nahin he
 At the same time, the bench drew his attention to the fact that as Chief of Army Staff, General Singh reached the top post which any military officer aspires to
 sheersh nyaayalay ne is baat kii ore bhi dhyaan dilaayaa ki general singh kii rit yachika janmatithi ke nirdhaaran ke liye nahin balki sarkari dastavejon main unki janm tithi kii pahchaan ke liye he
 The army chief was further disappointed when the court refused to accept his request that the government's order of his birth date of 10 May 1950 be confined to the Army's records only
 general singh dwaara apni yachika waapas liye jane ke baad adaalat ne use nistarit ghoshit kar diya
 Earlier, Vahanvati made it clear that the government was adamant on its order of 21 and 22 July in which General Singh's claim of 1951 as his birth year was rejected
 unhone sheersh nyaayalay se kaha ki sarkaar evam raksha mantri ko sena kaa netritv karne ke maamle main general singh par purna vishwaas he
 After leaving the court, army chief's counsel Puneet Bali said it was a victory for both the sides as the case was resolved in an acceptable manner
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki hamaari yachika seva ke vistaar (general singh kii) ke liye nahin thi balki yah general ke sammaan or eemaandaaree kaa maamla tha
 He said that we are satisfied that his honor and honesty has been restored

 After her husband's death, Kuli's job is done at Bhopal station, you have seen and heard many stories of night shift houses daily, but the story of Lakshmi, who lives in Bhopal, is such a story of struggle, seeing everyone give her courage Used to be
 ham baat kar rahe hai bhopal kii pehali mahila kuli lakshmi kii jisane apane parivaar kaa pet paalane or bacchon ke sunahare bhavishya ke liye dusron kaa boj uthaane vaale kuli kaa pesha chunaa, jisapar aamtaur par purushon kaa varchasv rahata he
 Actually, Lakshmi was married to Rishi, a coolie who works at Bhopal railway station
 pati kii maut ke baad lakshmi ko railway adhikariyon ne niyamanusaar kuli kii naukari di
 Where badge number 13 became the identity of Lakshmi
 isi billaa number 13 ko pahanakar lakshmi bhopal railway stesan par rojaanaa nite shift karti he
 Lakshmi also spends her household on the income earned by working as a porter and takes care of the children from their education
 haalanki lakshmi ko is baat kaa malaal he ki uski kamai itani nahin he ki wo apane bachche ko acchhee shiksha dilaa sake
 Although he says that good education is started in government school nowadays, he is confident that his child's future will be bright
 aapako bataa den ki lakshmi rojaanaa nite shift main hi kaam karti he or din main ghar ke jaruri kaam puure karti he
 Lakshmi works for about 6 hours
 amuman lakshmi shaam 6 baje se apni duty kii shuruyaat karti he lekin kabhi-kabhi der raat tak duty kerani padati he kyonki raat ko aane vaali rajdhani or premium trainon ke yatriyon se thik-thaak kamai ho jaati he
 According to Laxmi, she earns daily, she comes to work even after getting sick, but keeps in mind that by not doing much work, she goes home early so that health does not have much effect because health is necessary to earn money everyday
 Accompany
 lakshmi ke mutabik amuman wo 300-400 rupee tak saamaanya taur par roj kama leti he lekin kai baar aisa hota he jab uski kamai bamushkil hi 100-200 rupee tak ho paati ho
 At the same time, people are impressed when they see a woman working as a porter, but it is not that everyone picks things up from Lakshmi
 lakshmi ne bataaya ki kai baar log uski aise hi madad karne kii koshish karte hai lekin wo unako manaa kar detii he
 However, many times people give him more money as a reward along with picking up the goods, which helps Lakshmi
 gujarat main alag-alag tarah ke chunavi rang dekhne ko mil rahe hai
 On Monday, the Chief Minister of the state Vijay Rupani arrived on the scooty to submit the form from Rajkot West seat, everyone was surprised to see
 vajah bhi he, kyonki desh kaa sabase viksit rajya kahe jane vaale gujarat kaa siem agar apane namakan ke din chaar pahiyaa gaadi kii vyavastha na kar sake to yah chaunkaane ke liye kaaphi tha
 Rupani Bhat is a millionaire does not end here, the affidavit given during the nomination proved that Rupani 9
 08 karod kii sampatti ke maalik hai or unke paas ek inova car or patni ke paas maaruti wagon aar car he
 People did not understand the reason for filling the form by riding on Rupani's scooty
 isaki pehali vajah to yah he ki vah chunaav main khud ko saamaanya or janata se judaa hua dikhaane kii koshish main hai or isi vajah se aam naagarik kii tarah bina kisi laav lashkar ke skuti par savaar hue parchaa bharne nikal pade
 Mathematics of Dhankuberajrajkot west seat of Rajkot is also another reason for Rupani to explain this step
 rajkot se roopaani ke khilaaf congress ne jis ummidavaar ko utaara he vah rajya kaa doosraa sabase amir pratyaashee he
 Indranil Rajyaguru of Congress is contesting the same seat from his seat 141 in the affidavit
 22 karod bataai he
 He owns several luxury vehicles and owns several business establishments
 jaankaree ke mutabik indranil congress party ke liye motaa chanda jutate hai
 This is the reason that with the help of Dhanbal, he decided to leave his reserved seat of Rajkot East and contest against Rupani from the west
 bataaya ye bhi ja rahaa he ki ilaake main lage sabhi prachaar hording tak indranil ne kharid rakhe hai, aise main dhan or bheed ke maamle main roopaani ke liye unka saamana kar paanaa mumkin nahin he
 Chief Minister Vijay Rupani's difficulties seem to be increasing due to Indranil's hold in expectation from Keshubhai
 isi vajah se roopaani ne keshubhai patel se bhi mulaakaat kii he
 Keshubhai Patel has an old relationship with Rajkot and Vijay Rupani hopes that Keshubhai will campaign for him in the elections
 to jab siem roopaani paise kii takat main indranil se muqabla nahin kar sake tab jaakar unhone aam aadmi vaali apni chhavi ko janata ke bich pahunchaaya, taaki chunaav main is chhavi kaa phayda mili or siem apni seat bachaane main safal ho saken

 That too not in the form of money or school stuff

 This is enough to bring happiness to the faces of children studying in school
 unhen bhi lagata he ki bhale hi ve garib hai, unke paas makaan or gaadiyaan nahin hai, lekin ve bhi samaaj kaa hissaa hai
 Barring the weather, Sharma runs his school without any Naga

 maakan ne shanivaar ko yah bhi daawa kiya ki janata ab kejariwal ko nakaar rahi he or dilli main congress ko waapas laana chaah rahi he
 He said, 'congress workers and all leaders of Delhi do not want any kind of alliance with Kejriwal's party at all
 isaki kuch vajah hai
 The first reason is that the popularity of Kejriwal has been steadily declining and the public has now rejected them
 ’maakan ne kaha, ‘duusari vajah yah he ki 2011 main kejariwal ne baba ramdev, kiran bedi, aresas or bijepi ke saath milakar congress ko nuksaan pahunchaaya or modi ko khadaa kiya tha
 In such a situation, there is no question of alliance with Kejriwal
 ’congress netaa maakan ne kaha ki vidhansabha chunaav main aam aadmi party ko 56 fisadi vot mili the or nagar nigam chunaav main use sirf 26 fisadi vot mili
 On the other hand, the Congress vote has increased from 9 percent to 22 percent
 unhone kaha ki congress kaa graph lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he
 In the by-elections of Rajouri Garden and Bawana Legislative Assembly, we saw that aap's vote has dropped significantly

 basapa adhyaksh mayawati ne ravivaar ko bijepi par aarope lagaaya ki party narendra modi ko nichali jati kaa netaa bataakar pichhadaa varg or dalit matadaataaon ko dhokhaa de rahi he
 He questioned the identity of bjp's prime ministerial candidate Modi and said that Modi, who talks of development by calling himself backward, does not reveal his caste even when he is repeatedly asked
 nichle tabake ke logon ko aagaah karte hue unhone kaha, 'modi ne pichde samudaay ke logon ko abhi tak ye nahin bataaya he ki wo kis jati se sambandh rakhte hai
 In such a situation, you need to be careful with the BJP
 'mayawati ne kaha ki bijepi apane brahman netaaon kaa sammaan nahin karti or usne murali manohar joshi ko varanasi seat chhodane par majaboor kar diya

 unhone musalamaanon ko voton ke vibhaajan se bachane kii salaah di or kaha ki congress yaa sapa ko vot dene se bijepi ko phayda hoga

 The Hoshwadodaranagar Corporation of the police flew by seeing the electronic chip in the pigeon, had planned to resettle 450 and more families of Kalyannagar and Kamatipura in Kalali
 kalali ke saath hi new manjalpur or saiyajipura jaise posh ilaake hai
 If sources are to be believed, people here have objected to the Muslim families settling there, saying that they do not want 'problem-causing elements' among themselves

 About 80 percent of the families removed from there are Muslim

 1996, 1998, 1999, 2004 or 2009 ke chunaavon main mamata ne is seat par apana kabja barkaraar rakhaa
 Mamta was also the Minister of Human Resource Development, Sports and Youth Welfare and Women and Child Development in the Narasimha Rao government in 1991

 The rest of the India team defeated the defending Ranji champions Rajasthan by a huge margin of 404 runs in the Irani Trophy match played at Sawai Mansingh Stadium on the basis of their bowlers' superb performance led by Pragyan Ojha (60 / 4)
 shesh bharat dwaara die gaye 618 ranon ke lakshya kaa peechha karne utari rajasthan kii team paanchaven or antim din duusari pari main 213 ranon par simat gai
 Apart from Ojha, Rahul Sharma, Umesh Yadav took two wickets each while Vinay Kumar and Varun Aaron got one each
 ojha ne is match main kul nau wicket apane naam kiye
 In the first innings, Ojha dismissed five players for 86 runs
 rajasthan kii team ne chauthe din kii samaapti tak bina koi wicket ganvaae 28 ran banaae the, lekin paanchaven din uske ballebaajon ne niraashajanak pradarshan kiya
 As a result, he lost all his wickets by the beginning of the third season
 rajasthan ke liye madhur khatri ne sarvaadhik 53 ran banaae, jabaki rashmi paridaa ne 37 ranon kaa yogadan diya
 Akash Chopra (26), Vineet Saxena (17), Captain Hrishikesh Kanitkar (1), Robin Bisht (18) disappointed
 shesh ekadash ne shikhar dhawan (177) or anjiky rehane (152) ke shandaar shatakon kii badaulat apni pehali pari main 663 ran banaae the jabaki rajasthan kii team pehali pari main 400 ran bana saki thi

 emsidi chunaav ko lekar jahaan partiyon main khinchataan jari he to vahiin kaaphi samay baad aakhirkaar dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne congress ko apane nishane par le liya he
 After all, why Kejriwal, who attacked the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP with his statements on every issue, has suddenly turned the target towards the Congress
 dilli vidhansabha ke pehle satr main aam taur par bijepi par barasane vaale kejariwal ko congress kii yaad aa hi gai or unhone congress ko jamkar khari khoti sunai
 The Chief Minister of Delhi once again took on the Congress by raising the issue of electricity
 arvind kejariwal ne congress par bijli companiyon ko bachaane kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit ne bijli companiyon kii kaig se audit ko lekar jhuth bolaa tha lekin jaise hi aam aadmi party kii sarkaar bani sabase pehle bijli companiyon kaa kaig se audit karaayaa jisamen 8000 karod kaa ghapala paaya gaya
 Kejriwal further said that, even after losing the Delhi Assembly elections, the Congress is engaged in saving the power companies
 jahaan dilli sarkaar ne bijli ke rate aadhe kiye to vahiin agar is report ko lagu kar diya jaae to bijli ke rate or kam ho sakate hai lekin bijli companiyaan hoicourt chali gayi or vahaan court ne use khaarij kar diya
 At present, this matter is in the Supreme Court, while the Congress has given its three big lawyers to save the power companies
 abhishek manu singhvi, pi chidarambam or kapil sibbal unka bachaav kar rahe hai
 He said that at first Congress looted Delhi for 15 years and even after losing it is still trying to save the power companies
 bijli companiyon kaa maamla kaaphi purana he lekin emsidi chunaav kii aahat aate hi congress par nishaanaa saadhane kii khatir mudda baahar aa chukaa he
 In the 2015 assembly elections, the Congress's seat in Delhi was clear, but in the MCD election, the Congress's plank seems to be overshadowed
 2015 main hue dilli vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ke chunaav haarane ke baad bhi vot pratishat main koi kami nahin thi jabaki congress ke vot pratishat main kaaphi giravat dekhi gai thi
 But in the 2016 MCD by-election in Delhi, the Congress made a tremendous comeback by winning 5 out of 13 seats
 jabaki ek saal pehle hi 70 main se 67 siten jeetne vaali aam aadmi party ko bhi utani hi yani 5 siten hi mili thim jo ki aam aadmi party ke liye jhatka tha
 Actually, people living in slums and outer Delhi and people from unauthorized colonies have been the traditional voters of the Congress
 lekin 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main ye voters shift hokar aam aadmi party main chale gaye the jiskaa phayda aap ko mila tha
 But the victory of the Congress in the MCD by-election and now the preparations of the Congress has forced the Aam Aadmi Party
 jiske baad arvind kejariwal sidhe taur par congress ko nishane par le rahe hai
 BJP has been in power for 10 years
