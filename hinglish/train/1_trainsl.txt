 After the return of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi from the holidays, the party has once again intensified about the UP Assembly elections
 vatan vaapasi karte hi rahul ne netaaon or kaaryakartaaon se feedback lenaa shuru kar diya he, vahiin rahul yaa priyanka gandhi ke siem ummidavaar banane kaa prastaav dene vaale prashanth kishor donon kii 'naa' ke baad ab shila dikshit par daanv lagane kii taiyaari main hai
 The matter is of UP, so Rahul Gandhi is in a mood to take time and decide instead of taking any action in a hurry
 somvaar kosonia gandhi, rahul gandhiore upi prabharee gulam nabi aaazaad ne 10 janpath main dhai ghante tak maathapai kii, lekin koi faisla nahin ho sakaa
 Speaking on the issue, Congress leader RPN Singh said, 'strategy is being made
 jaldi hi sabake saamne uskaa elaan hoga
 On the other hand, on the question of Priyanka's role from the Congress platform and change in UP, Jairam Ramesh said that Azad saheb has already given a statement in this matter
 party kaa yahi kahana he ki jab faisla hoga to aapako bataa diya jayega
 If not Priyanka, then Sheela is the only source close to Congress election manager Prashant Kishore in UP and PK believes that Sheela will be the best option in UP even after the FIR is registered in the tanker case
 upi kii siyasat ke maddenjar shila kii image vikaas karne vaali rahi he
 The tanker case can be easily rescued from it by being politically motivated
 saath hi shila kii umr or kad ke kaaran upi ke netaaon ko bhi unako sweekaar karne main zyada dikkat nahin hogi
 According to senior leaders from Sheila, troubles, senior party leaders Sheila is considering suicide as a suicide step in Koopi
 is kheme kaa tark he ki shila dikshit umradraj hai, doosraa un par haal hi FIR darj hui he
 She has lost badly in the Delhi elections
 aise main virdohi iskaa phayda uthaa lenge, vahiin rajya main party ke netaaon kaa bada tabaka shila ko apana netaa man se sweekaar nahin karegaa
 Due to this, the party will not be able to unite and fight in the electoral arena
 rajya ke kisi netaa ko mili kamanasenior netaaon kaa maananaa he ki agar brahman cheharaa hi dena he to jitin prasad, pramod tiwari or rajesh mishra kaa naam zyada behatar rahegaa
 a section of Rahul's close friends are now also naming the names of film star and MP Rajabbar
 unka tark he ki rajbabbar kaa janaa-pahachaanaa cheharaa or bedaag chhavi party ko phayda pahunchaa sakate hai
 Also, the politics of up's caste politics can also break Raj Babbar, because his image is not of any particular caste
 iske alaava rahul ke lautne ke baad amethi rajgaraane se aane vaale rajyasabha saansad sanjay singh ke naam par bhi charchaa alaakaman kar rahaa he
 Rajput leader Sanjay Singh is also in the race in the brahmin-rajput equation from UP politics
 upi ke lihaaj se dabang chhavi or sanjay gandhi style aaf politics unke positive points maane ja rahe hai
 Preparation for adjusting big leaders in committees: The post of chairman of all election-related committees like the state president and leader of the legislative party, as well as the campaign committee chairman, manifesto committee chairman, is preparing to keep the big leaders of the state in the context of the homogenous equation
 in ahm netaaon main purv mantri arpyen singh, saansad piel punia, purv saansad rajaraam, purv kendriya mantri shriprakash jaisawal, paasi samaaj se purv mantri raamalaal raahi jaise netaaon ke naamon par vichaar chal rahaa he
 According to sources close to Mathapachirahul for the next few days, the rounds of discussion on everything will continue
 naam aage peeche hote rahenge, lekin id ke baad kabhi bhi party apni ranneeti, sanghathan ke sangyojan or chehron ke saath janata ke saamne hogi
 The party is currently preparing to jump into the election campaign from July 15
 bayaan main kaha gaya he ki 15 kilometre lanbaa balangir-bichupali nayaa rail line tateey odisha ko rajya ke pashchimi hisse se jodega

 bhartiya mausam vibhaag ne is saptaah ke shuruyaat main apane anumaan main kaha tha june-sitambar ke dauraan 93 fisadi barish hogi

 iskaa vastav main kya arth he? apane desh, apane raashtra, apni mathrubhumi ke liye pyaar? beshak isko tukdon-tukdon main samajhane main kuch jokhim to he lekin vastav main bina kuch bal kii khaal nikaale deshbhakti ko sahi tarah paribhaashit kar bhi nahin sakate

 yaa aap kah sakate hai ki ve sabhi sahamat the ki yah is baat par nirbhar karata he ki aap koun hai—film nirmaataa yaa lekhak, shikshak yaa sainik, gayak yaa rajanyik

 Many people who have written their views for this issue say that patriotism is quite different from nationalism
 usase kahin purana, kahin gudh or shaayad adhik pramanik
 According to some others, the nation is the ancient, authentic source of our identity
 kya ham apni mitti ke prati jo aakarshan mahasoos karte hai kya usamen hamaare 'mul sthaan' (yaa ham vastav main jahaan rahete hai) or ek rashtriya kalpana ke prati jo nishtha hamaari he, usamen kuch antar aata he?yaa ek bhaavnaatmak kram he jo satat chalata aa rahaa he? isi prakaar parloukikta, purvaagrah or paradesiyon ke prati ghrinaa sthaan ke prati prem par chaa jaati he jo is upmahadweep ke samaaj kii sabase choti ikai main kabhi upar to kabhi neeche hoti rahati he
 The plurality of India became the power to assimilate it and this created a completely different form of patriotism which is not seen anywhere else in the world
 bhartiya deshbhakti in sabhi virodhabhaason or vidambnaaon se bachi rahi he—kabhi-kabhi aisa lagata he ki yah un par panapati he
 At one time we were inspired to see the image of the whole of India in one person
 lekin yah lambey samay tak nahin chalaa
 An Arab patriot should not expect such a slogan

 Is a resident of Mumbai peshey se doctor hai Dharma is famous as Guru laden ko nahin maanate aatanki hai Advises Muslims to become terrorists pis tivi ke jariye bangladesh main lokapriy hai Their entry is banned in Britain, Malaysia, Canada ekanath khadse or prakaash mehta par diya nadda ne javabndda ne karpshan ke kaaran khadse-mehta par ection kii baat kaboolibhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main kuch varisht netaaon ko tikat kii fehrist se jab baahar kiya to har taraf isaki charchaa hui
 In particular, the ticketing of Eknath Khadse and Prakash Mehta, who were ministers in the Devendra Fadnavis cabinet, was seen as a shocking move
 yah kaha gaya ki bhrashtachar ke kaaran in netaaon ko kinare kiya gaya, haalanki mukhyamantri fadanvis ne iske peeche jimmedaariyon main badlaav kaa hawala diya

 darasal, jepi nadda se yah sawaal kiya gaya ki ekanath khadse or prakaash mehta ke rup main jab do mantriyon ko karpshan ke kaaran cabinet se baahar kiya gaya to bijepi svachh sarkaar kaa daawa kaise kar sakati he, is par jepi nadda ne jawaab diya ki aisa hona bijepi or sarkaar kii niyat ko darshata he

 Let us know that senior minister Eknath Khadse had to resign from the Fadnavis cabinet after being named in the MIDC land scam
 inke alaava prakaash mehta bhi bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke baad cabinet se baahar ho gaye the
 Not only this, these two leaders have not even been given tickets for assembly elections this time
 khadse or mehta ke alaava vinod taavade or chandrashekhar baavankule ko bhi bijepi ne tikat nahin die hai
 The reason behind giving tickets to all these senior leaders was given new responsibilities from BJP
 lekin nadda ne sweekaar kiya he ki in netaaon ke khilaaf uthaae gaye kadam party kii niyat or samvedansheeltaa ko dikhaata he

 Speaking on the agenda of 'aaj Tak Aaj Tak' morcha against Modi ', Lalu Prasad Yadav said that people talking about bringing black money are now diverting
 jhaadu pakadaa rahe hai
 What is going on? kah rahe hai ki kaala dhan kitna he, nahin maaloom
 But we will definitely bring it
 tasviren ham samaajawaadee hai, pataka-pataki bhi karenge: lalu yadavajanata parivaar ke saathi dalon ke aapas main hi ladane ke sawaal par lalu ne kaha ki ham to aapas main ladate rahe hai or ladenge
 But they will not let them stay
 bihar kaa hi dekhie, hamaare vot or nitish ke vot mila liye jaaen, to bijepi kahin nahin he
 On the question of Prime Minister Modi's meeting with US President Barack Obama in the meantime, Lalu Yadav said that the conversionists are demanding a law against it
 lekin seemaa par hamaara sainik shahid hota he
 Who came from America on LOC
 aap log modi ko hi dikhaate ho
 When we raise the question of social justice, you guys show 'three Yadavs'
 iske baad apane puraane saathiyon par nishaanaa sadhate hue lalu ne kaha ki ramvilas achche mausam vaigyanik hai
 We do not mind
 acha mausam vaigyanik hona chahie
 But we are on the road and not going to break down
 hamaare bich koi igo problem nahin he, 22 ko jantar manjar se modi sarkaar ke khilaaf hallaa bolenge
 On the question of conversion, Lalu said in his familiar style that the entire Gujarat knows about Amit Shah talking about law against conversion
 carch jalaae gaye hai, isaayiyon ko peeta gaya
 Then the word was coined Love Jihad

 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had made efforts to encircle Rahul in Amethi, due to which the Congress was left sweating to save its fort
 mana ja rahaa he ki sapa-basapa gathbandhan ab apni ranneeti main badlaav karte hue ummidavaar na utaarne kaa man badal gaya he
 If the alliance fielded its candidates against Congress President Rahul Gandhi in Amethi and Sonia Gandhi in Rae Bareli, the Congress may have to chew iron and gram to save its stronghold
 amethi or raiberli donon siton par dalit or obisi khaskar yadav samudaay ke matadaata achche khaase hai
 Muslim voters in Amethi are close to 4 lakh
 jabaki raibareli main teen lakh ke kareeb yadav hai
 Experts believe that if the SP-BSP alliance takes steps to enter the electoral fray against the Congress, then there is an increased chance of getting scattered among these voters
 aise main congress ke jeet kii raah bighad sakati he
 SP leader and former district panchayat president Ram Singh Yadav said that it would not be easy for the Congress to win these seats if the SP-BSP alliance enters the electoral fray in Rae Bareli and Amethi
 donon siton par jaateey sameekaran gathbandhan ke paksh main he, aise main sapa-basapa ne congress ko in siton par sanjivani di he
 In the 2012 assembly elections, the SP was successful in winning four seats of Rae Bareli and the Congress could not open the account
 jabaki, congress ke raibareli jila sachiv naushaad khateeb kehete hai ki raibareli or amethi main basapa har baar chunaav ladati rahi hai, lekin congress netritv ko kabhi bhi koi dikkat nahin ai he
 The people of this region rise above casteism, theism and nepotism and vote for the Congress leadership
 aise main sapa-basapa in donon siton par chunaav ladate bhi to koi khaas asar nahin daal pate, kyonki vidhansabha or loksabhaa ke chunaav alag-alag hote hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP fielded Smriti Irani against Rahul Gandhi
 amethi sansadeey seat par rahul gandhi ko kareeb chaar lakh or bijepi kii smriti irani ko kareeb teen lakh vot mili the
 Whereas SP had not fielded any candidate in support of Congress
 iske baavjood rahul kareeb 1 lakh vot se hi jeet sake the
 Apart from this, the Congress account could not be opened in the 2017 assembly elections in Amethi
 jabaki bijepi ne paanch vidhansabha siton main se chaar par jeet hasil kii thi or ek seat sapa kii jholii main gai thi
 At the same time, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP fielded Ajay Agarwal from Sonia Gandhi from Rae Bareli
 modi lahar ke baavjood wo sonia ke saamne kadi chunauti pesh nahin kar sake the
 But the BJP had received about two lakh votes
 iske baad jab 2017 main vidhansabha chunaav hue to bijepi ko 2, congress ko 2 or ek seat par sapa ko jeet mili thi
 In Amethi and Rae Bareli, the BJP has been active for a long time to feed the lotus
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi raibareli kaa daura kiya tha
 During this time, he had flagged off several development plans and also addressed a big rally

 India has long wanted to use the issues of Taiwan, South China Sea and the Dalai Lama to negotiate with China

 In such a situation, countries using Taiwan to stop China will have to suffer

 Pollution is continuously increasing in Delhi NCR
 vahiin dilli aaj tak bhi pradooshan ko lekar ek muhim chalaa rahaa he, jiskaa naam he ‘saans kaa apatkaal'
 The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has recently released a report in which Ghaziabad has been ranked first in the country in terms of pollution
 gajiabad kii sthit dekhakar to yahi lagata he kii yahaan saans kaa apatkaal laga hua he
 Ghaziabad is the biggest reason of increasing pollution in NCR
 gajiabad main sabase zyadapradooshantraphic jam kii vajah se ho rahaa he
 There are 3 different national highways that originate here, due to which there is a long traffic jam daily
 Pm 10 ke badhane kaa sabase basaav kaaran hi ye he ki in trakon bason se lagaataar dhuaan nikal rahaa he
 On the other hand, Ghaziabad is considered an industrial area
 yahaan hajaaron kii taadaad main factory hai
 The smoke emanating from them is acting as poison in the air
 iske alaava kooday main lagaai jane vaali aag se bhi pradooshan fail rahaa he
 Anand Vihar bus station is also becoming a major reason for causing pollution in the air of Delhi NCR
 yahaan rojaanaa saikadon basen taffic main fansi rahati he, jiske kaaran bason se ek saath ek hi jagah par dhuna nikalataa he
 Most of the buses here are of diesel
 siesai kaa bhi kahana he kii pradooshan badhaane main anand vihaar bas adde kii badi bhoomika he
 Ghaziabad ranked first in the country in the Central Pollution Control Board report
 
 
 kendriya pradooshan niyantran board (sipisibi) ne pichley teen varshon kii satat nigaraanee ke aadhaar par ek report taiyaar kii he
 According to this report, PM10 is increasing rapidly in 94 cities of the country
 hairat kii baat to yah ki in shaharon main uttar pradesh kaa gajiabad number van par he, vahiin desh kii rajdhani dilli chauthe number par
 The most important thing is that seven of the top ten polluted cities are from Uttar Pradesh
 ye hai piem 10 kii drushti se sarvaadhik pradooshit 10 shahar- gajiabad- elahabaad- bareli- dilli- kanpur- firozabad- agra- alvar- gajraula- jaipurhafn-10 ke badhane kaa sabase bada kaaran vaahanon se nikalne vaala dhuaan he
 Ghaziabad is a city from which many states pass through
 gajiabadase hote hue teen neshnal haive nikalate hai
 
 
 - National Highway- 24- National Highway- 58- National Highway- 92 Through these highways, one has to pass through Ghaziabad to go to states like Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, and Odisha
 yani matlab saaf he
 The biggest reason for increasing pollution in Ghaziabad is the frequent trains passing through here
 agar dilli kii baat karen to dilli main sienji se chalane vaali basen hoti hai
 But most of the buses in Ghaziabad are run by diesel
 vahiin gajiabad ke paas hi anandvihar bas adde par bhi rojaanaa hi desh ke alag-alag rajyon se saikadon basen aati-jaati rahati hai
 When we wanted to know the opinion of experts about pollution in Jabziabad, Pollash Mukerji, Research Associate, CSE said that the biggest reason for pollution in Ghaziabad is the vehicles passing through here
 vahiin yahaan ki factriyon se nikalne vaale dhuen ke kaaran bhi pradooshan badhata he
 But the reason for increasing pollution in Ghaziabad is not just the industrial area or these vehicles
 balki yahaan jamaa hone vaali gandagi bhi yahaan failane valepradooshan kaa mukhya kaarandikhai padataa he
 Now it is necessary that the people living in Ghaziabad should also do at least pollution so that Ghaziabad can be pollution free

 yah hamaare samaaj kii ek buniyadi jarurat ko rekhaankit karata he- eemaandaar hon or sach ke saath rahen
 This campaign expands the role played by this brand in our lives and looks at the forums of 'truth' in a very different way

 And it is very important to have a brand like Aaj Tak at such a place - which raises the flag of truth in the atmosphere being created on the basis of sensation
 sachche rahen- apane prati, apane peshey ke prati, apni naukari ke prati, desh ke prati, maanavtaa ke prati or sabase mahatvapurn, apane vivek ke prati
 Whether a doctor, accountant, bank manager or public servant, Aaj Tak has been trying to teach and remind people of the values of speaking the truth through their campaign
 sadachaar or sach ke nichle maanak ke saath samjhauta karne kii koi vajah nahin he
 Despite 17 years of undisputed leadership, we believe that 'there is no other rich heritage like honesty' and that is why every time a breaking news / story comes, the record in Aaj Tak's TRP is up

 People always say that you have to fulfill the hobby in life soon because life is very short
 lekin mouj-masti par kharch karne ke saath hi aapako future ko surakshit karne ke bare main bhi sochna chahie
 And for this, financial planning is very important in time
 aaj kii bachat par hi sukhi va surakshit bhavishya kaa aadhaar tikaa hota he, isliye is maamle ko thodi gambhirtha se len
 For this, you should make a budget and take some important economic decisions before the age of 30, focusing on savings
 exparts kaa bhi yahi maananaa he ki samay par uthaae gaye samajhadaari bhare financial step 50 ke padaav ko paar karne ke baad jindagi aasaan bana dete hai
 So, know about 6 decisions that you should take before you reach the age of 30 - 1) Raise money
 Never think that you will think of old age in old age
 dhyaan rahe ki aapaki abhi se kii gai bachat hi bhavishya main kaam aegi
 Always keep in mind one word of compound interest
 agar aap kam umr main paise jamaa karne lagenge to compound interest ke tahat is rakam par mili byaaj par bhi saal dar saal byaaj milegaa
 If you raise one thousand every month, then this amount will be huge till your retirement with compound interest
 2) ghar kii planning30 saal ke hone se pehle hi aapako yah faisla kar lenaa chahie ki aapako apana khud kaa ghar lenaa he yaa phir kiraaye ke ghar main rahanaa he
 In both cases the burden on your salary has to increase
 aise main rent ho yaa homelon par banane valiiemai, donon ke liye aapako pehle se hi planningkar seaving shuru kar deni chahie
 3) Take life insurance before the insurance plan turns 30 years old

 aise main kam ritern vaali yojanaon ke jhaanse main aane se bachein or research ke baad hi koi kadam uthaaen
 Just getting life insurance is not enough, that is why it is important to have medical insurance
 kyonki agar kabhi aapke saath koi durghatana ho gai to aapako kai din aspataal main bhartee rahanaa padataa he, jisamen kaaphi paise kharch hote hai
 In such a situation, get your and your family's medical insurance done
 4) imargency fund jodenapako hameshaa apni 3-6 maheene kii selary imargency fund ke rup main rakhni chahie
 The biggest advantage of this is that if you leave a job somewhere in the middle or you are fired, then you can easily manage your expenses without being dependent on the next job
 5) kariyar30 ke hone se pehle agar aap 2-3 job change kar chuke he or abhi bhi santusht nahin he to jarurat he khud par research karne kii
 In such a situation, give yourself some time and research and try to know which job you find pleasure in
 iske baad ek line chunakar apni skill ko badhaane kii koshish karen
 Also, try to make stagnation in life and expenses, so that your savings and investments can all be fixed
 6) bacchon kii sochevgar aapaki shaadi ho gai he or aapke bachche hai yaa family planning kar rahe hai, to inke bhavishya ke liye bachat bhi abhi se shuru kar den
 We all know that nowadays college fees and wedding expenses are increasing in an inimitable manner
 dhyaan rahe ki apane bachche ke liye aap esaypi mennivesh shuru kar den
 By doing this, you will be able to give him easy money when his college time comes and he will not have to take back his steps

 Can't the same amount be spent to heal her wounds? - Why is Jalsa being organized at the government expense itself? - Why are such programs not organized with party funds? Will be calculated according to the advice of PM Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley i
e

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has taken a historic decision to make Prayagraj Kumbh memorable
 prayagraj ke pavitra sangam par lage aasthaa ke is kumbh main jahaan jagah-jagah saanskrithik or dharmik rang bikhare hue hai, vahiin ye kumbh ab bhartiya raajnneeti ke ek nae itihaas kaa sakshi bhi banegaa

 There will also be a cabinet meeting here
 mangalvaar ko upi sarkaar kumbhanagari se hi chalegi
 Yogi Adityanath and his cabinet and minister of state will be in Kumbhanagri
 mana ja rahaa he ki kumbhanagari main ho rahi is cabinet baithak main sarkaar koi bada faisla bhi le sakati he
 Spokesperson in Uttar Pradesh government Shrikant Sharma said, 'every Tuesday there is a cabinet meeting of the UP government
 ab tak to ye baithak lakhanu main hi hoti thi, lekin pehali baar cabinet baithak kii taiyaari prayagraj kumbh main kii gai he
 There will be a meeting of the UP Cabinet on Tuesday at 11 am in the office of the Kumbh Mela Authority in Kumbhanagri
 jisaki adhyakshata khud mukhyamantri yogi adityanath karenge
 'minister-officers will be included in the meeting
 Both Deputy Chief Ministers in the meeting Dr
 dinesh sharma or keshav maurya maujuud rahenge
 Apart from this, excellent arrangements have been made in the Kumbh Mela area for 25 cabinet ministers, 9 state ministers of independent charge and 22 ministers of state

 While Yogi Adityanath is very excited for this meeting, Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya demanded a report of preparations from senior officials
 keshav prasad maury ne kaha ki mukhyamantri ne kumbh se sarkaar chalaane kaa aitihaasik faisla kiya to pradesh ke aalaa adhikari bhi intjaam main jute gaye
 Everyone has the same concern that there is no core

 They will be welcomed with flower garlands

 Yogis along with all their ministers will also take a dip in the confluence
 prayagraj main pahunche sadhu sant is baat se gadgad hai ki sarkaar khud unke paas pahunch rahi he
 This Kumbh has taken place just before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, in which sadhus are continuously pressuring the Modi and Yogi government regarding the Sant Ram temple
 aise main yogi sarkaar ne kumbhanagari main cabinet baithak karne kaa masterstroke maaraa he
 The opposition is now questioning this decision
 samaajawaadee party ke pravaktaa sunil yadav ne yogi sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa
 However, Prayagraj Kumbh has already become yogim before the meeting of the Yogi cabinet
 jagah-jagah yogi adityanath ke hording lage hai
 It will not be decided what will be decided in the Yogi Cabinet meeting on the Sangam Coast on Tuesday, but it is believed that the government can take major decisions in the Yogi government's cabinet meeting two days before the saints' sermons in Kumbh

 Shortly after his expulsion from the party, Binny, an MLA from Laxminagar, told reporters, "it cannot be unfortunate that you need someone who can remind you of what you have promised to the public and then you can give the same person to the party
" Let it out
 ’binni ne kaha, ‘mujhe party se baahar karne se pehle aapako un logon ko nishkasit karnaa chahie tha, jinhone desh ko baantne kii baat kii, jinhone mahilaon se badasluki kii, jinhone desh ke kanoon kaa majaak banaaya or jinhone niyamon ko taak par rakhaa

 Mr
 Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA
 These agreements are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 very common among celebrities and people of wealth
 In this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in Arbitration for damages against Ms
 Clifford (daniels)
 The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair
 Prior to its violation by Ms
 Clifford and her attorney, this was a private agreement
 Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll in this transaction
 The payment has raised questions regarding possible violations of promotional finance laws

 At the same time, the question also remains in the minds of many people that why the day of the death of God of Christianity is called 'good'? So it is said that Jesus Christ gave his life for the good of the people, that is why this day is addressed as 'good'
 good friday ke maukey par aap in states ko watsap or fasebuk par post kar sakate hai
 The day our mind starts remembering and taking interest in God, us din se hamaari pareshaaniyaan ham main dilchaspee lenaa bandha kar degi

 Ever since the painting 'salvatore Mundi', which is said to be the work of Leonardo da Vinci, sold for a record US $ 450 million, its location has been considered one of the biggest mysteries in the art world

 pehali tasviir patrakaron se ghire samaajavigyaani parth chatarji kii thi
 Surrounded by Sahafi, he was asking how would he defend the views revealed in his latest article in which he compared the statements of Army Chief Vipin Rawat and British General Dyer? duusari tasviir patrakaron se ghire sipiem netaa prakaash karaat kii he jisamen unase party mukhpatr pipuls demokrasi main likhe sampadakeey par sawaal kiya ja rahaa he jisamen general vipin ravat kii sena kaa raajnneetikaran karne ke liye aalochana he or unke haal main diye intervyuu ko modi sarkaar kii soch bataaya gaya he
 Eminent sociologist Partha Chatterjee wrote an article in the English website 'the Wire' on June 2, in which he described the army's action of tying and mounting a Kashmiri youngster, Farooq Ahmad Dar, in the valley (and then leading the man who carried out the action) The honor given to Leetul Gogoi and the interview of Army Chief General Vipin Rawat) was called General Dyer Moment i
e
 he compared that incident to Jallianwala Bagh Of murder ye tulana parth sirf major gogoi kii karrwai ke aadhaar par nahin karte balki un bayanon ke aadhaar par karte hai jo general vipin ravat ke intervyuu kaa hissaa the
 Partha Chatterjee says in his article, "it would not be right to say that General Rawat had the same intentions as General Dyer"
 lekin chatarji un bayanon kii samanta dikhaate hai jo jaliyanvaala baag ke baad diar ne apane ection ke bachaav main diye or kashmir kii ghatana ke baad general ravat ne apane intervyuu main major gogoi kaa bachaav karte huye kahe
 At the beginning of the article, Partha quotes General Dyer and says - "there comes a time when you look at a mirror and are stunned to see a face you don't recognize - the ugly face of a perverted stranger
" bahut saare bharatiyon ke liye is par vishwaas karnaa behad kathin hoga ki ek rajya ke taur par ham general diar vaale pal main pahunch gayi hai lekin saavdhaanee or nishpakshta se sochen to 1919 main british – indian army kii karrwai ke paksh main di daleelon or aaj 100 saal baad bhartiya sena ke bachaav main kahi baton main daraavnee samaantaayen hai
 " parth likhte hai ki general diar kaa bachaav british netaaon ne nahin kiya, lekin major gogoi kaa bachaav senadhyaksh ke saath sarkaar ke mantri bhi kar rahe hai
 Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu strongly criticized Partha Chatterjee's article, using words like parvarjan and idiotic
 patrakaron se ghire parth chatarji ne kaha vah kisi bhi aalochana kaa jawaab likhakar denge camaron ke saamne bolkar nahin
 Partha Chatterjee's article raises questions ranging from interviews with General Rawat to politicization of the army
 major litul gogoi ko sammanit karne ke baad general ravat ne apane intervyuu main ye tak kaha tha ki logon ko sena se darana chaiye
 In a democratic country like India, this statement of the Chief of Army Staff is frightening
 general ravat ne kaha – “aisi hi jang main aap naye tareeke dhundte hai
 You fight a dirty war by finding new ways
 agar mere afasar poochhate hai ki ham kya karen to kya mujhe unase kahana chaiye ki intazaar karo or mar jaao? main tumhaare liye ek badhiya coffin or tirangaa lekar aauungaa or tumhaare shav ko sammaan ke saath tumhaare parivaar waalon tak pahunchaa duungaa
 " general ravat kaa ye bayaan bhale hi sena kii majaburi or kathin halaat ke maddenzar major litul gogoi ke krity ko sahi tehraata ho lekin vah kai sawaalon ko dhundhala karne or unki andekhi karne kii koshish bhi he
 The picture of Farooq Ahmed Dar has now become an indelible part of the ongoing protest in Kashmir and this picture will continue to chase the Indian Army, claiming to be a disciplined and humane
 ye baat shaayad major gogoi or general ravat se behatar koi or nahin jaanata
 Perhaps that's why Parth Chatterjee in his article compares the same picture of Dar's human shield being made to that much-talked about Vietnam War
 jahaan ek 8 saal kii ladki bam se mili zakhmon ke saath sadak par daud rahi he
 You can easily find this picture in shame and showing the warped face of war
 chatarji ne apane lekh se jo sawaal uthaaye hai wo sena ke faislon ko naitikta kii kasuti par kasne kii bahes phir shuru karte hai
 Here the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham's theory of utilitarianism can defend Major Gogoi
 bantham kehete hai ki kisi faisle kaa naitikta kii kasuti par moolyankan us faisle ke parinaamon ke aadhaar par hona chaiye
 Bentham argues that we should seek maximum happiness for maximum people
 unke tark ke hisaab se sena ke javaanon ke saath kai logon ko bachaane kii major gogoi ne jo daleel di vah kaam kar sakati he
 i do not know if Major Leetul Gogoi knows Jeremy Bentham and his theory, or he may have thought of Bentham while tying Farrukh Dar in a jeep, but the argument he made is the principle of Utilitarianism, which is called Conventional Moral Reasoning in English That is, you decide morality based on the outcome of your act
 mahaan darshanik kahe jane vaale jerimi bantham kii apni is theory ke liye badi aalochana bhi hui kyonki yah soch kisi naitik faisle main alpsankhyakon (yahaan shabd kaa matlab number se he kisi dharm se nahin ) ke adhikaron ko andekha karti he yani ek vyakti ke marane se agar 100 log bachate hai to bantham kaa siddhant us krity kii vakaalat karata he
 On the other hand, what Partha Chatterjee is pointing out is the theory of German philosopher Emmanuel Kant that whatever action you take, whatever the final outcome is, is the measure of your morality
 is aadhaar par major gogoi or general ravat kii aalochana jaays he
 Kant used the term "moral worth" in his theory, capital that does not care whether you will be able to stop evil or achieve good results
 kaant kehete hai ki faisla naitikta ke aadhaar par hi hona chaiye
 Gandhiji has been clear about the idea that both means and means should be sacred
 apane lekh main parth chatarji kehete hai ki diar ne bharatiyon ko amritsar kii us gali main rengkar chalane par majaboor kiya jisamen ek british mahila kii pitayee hui thi
 Dyer said in his defense that doing so was his "horror" and "dirty duty"
 parth chatarji diar ke in shabdon ko general vipin ravat ke us intervyuu ke saamne rakhte hai jisamen unhone kashmir kii ladaai ko ek “darty war” kaha he
 But in the pictures which came out on Tuesday, the journalist was running behind CPM leader Prakash Karat on the question of politicizing the army, why are you hesitating to stand in favor of the army
 sena kaa virodh karnaa kisi desh desh ke nagarikon ke mul adhikaron ke hit main he to vah virodh kiya janaa chaiye
 What is there like treason in this? isi baat ko saavdhaanee ke saath kehete hai purv beurocret or lekhak pawan verma
 Varma said, "any officer or institution can be questioned because there is democracy here
" sawaal uthaanaa deshadroh nahin he lekin main yahaan par isi lay main ye bhi kahuunga ki parth chatarji ne jis bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya he usase vah batch sakate the
 "comments verma jis ore ishaara kar rahe hai vah parth chatarji ke lekh main istemaal kiye gayi rupakon kaa he
 Chatterjee not only makes an extreme comparison by drowning in sentiment, but he completely ignores the political failure of the leaders and the cross-border terrorism in Kashmir
 sawaal ye he ki kya parth chatarji general diar se tulana ke atirupakon kaa istemaal kiye bagaiyr yahi baat nahin kah sakate the
 Shared photos of General Dyer and General Vipin Rawat and the title of the article probably seem to blur Parth's entire argument
 samaaj or satta main baithe logon ko jhakzorne or unke zamir ko jagaane kii lekhak kii koshish is atishyokti main kahin bhatakati dikhti he or vah ahm sawaal kahin kho jaataa he jo vah apane lekh ke aakhir main uthaate hai ki raashtra ke taur par ham aise najuk mode par hai jo hamen pakistan kii tarah marshall lau yani sena kii hukumat kii ore le ja saktaa he
 The second picture is of CPM leader Prakash Karat surrounded by journalists in which he is being questioned on an editorial written in the party mouthpiece People's Democracy in which General Vipin Rawat is criticized for politicizing the army and in his recent interview, Modi government's thinking Has been reported
 jane maane samaajavigyaani parth chatarji ne angrezi website ‘di vir’ main 2 june ko ek lekh likhaa jisamen unhone ghati main kashmiri noujvaan farrukh ahamed daar ko jeep se baandhne or ghumaane kii sena kii karrwai (or uske baad is karrwai ko anjaam dene vaale ko major litul gogoi ko mili sammaan or army chif general vipin ravat ke intervyuu ) ko general diar mument kaha yani unhone us ghatana kii tulana jaliyanvaala baag hatyakand se kii
 Partha makes this comparison not only on the basis of Major Gogoi's action but also on the statements that were part of General Vipin Rawat's interview
 parth chatarji apane lekh main kehete hai, “ye kahana sahi nahin hoga ki general ravat ke iraade vahi the jo general diar ke the”
 But Chatterjee shows a similarity to the statements that Dyer made in defense of his action after Jallianwala Bagh, and General Rawat in his interview defending Major Gogoi after the Kashmir incident
 lekh kii shuruyaat main hi parth general diar ko uddhrut karte hai or kehete hai – “aisa vakt aata he jab aap aaina dekhte hai or usamen ek aisa cheharaa dekhakar stabdh rah jate hai jise aap nahin pahachaanate – ek vikrut ajanabi kaa badsoorat cheharaa
 It would be very difficult for many Indians to believe that as a state we have reached the moment of General Dyer, but think carefully and objectively, the arguments in favor of the british-indian Army action in 1919 and today 100 Years later, there are scary similarities in what the defense of the Indian Army said
 ” Partha writes that General Dyer was not defended by the British leaders, but Major Gogoi is defended by the Chief of Army Staff as well as the Minister of Government
 kendriya mantri vankeya naidu ne parth chatarji ke lekh kii kadi aalochana karte huye iske khilaaf parvarjan or idiotic jaise shabdon kaa istemaal kiya
 Surrounded by journalists, Partha Chatterjee said he would write a response to any criticism, not speaking in front of the cameras
 parth chatarji kaa lekh general ravat ke intervyuu se lekar sena ke raajnneetikaran tak ke sawaal uthaata he
 After honoring Major Leetul Gogoi, General Rawat even said in his interview that people should be afraid of the army
 bharat jaise loktantric desh main senadhyaksh kaa ye bayaan daraane vaala he
 General Rawat said - "in such a battle you find new ways
 aap ek gande yuddh ko naye tareekon ko khoj kar ladate hai
 If my officers ask what we should do, should i tell them to wait and die? i will bring you a nice coffin and tricolor and will carry your body with respect to your family members
 ” General Rawat's statement may justify Major letul Gogoi's act in view of the army's compulsions and difficult circumstances, but it is also an attempt to blur and ignore many questions
 farrukh ahamed daar kii tasviir ab kashmir main chal rahe virodh kaa ek amit hissaa ban chuki he or ye tasviir ek anushaasit or maanviya hone kaa daawa karne vaali bhartiya sena kaa peechha karti rahegi

 The questions raised by Chatterjee in his article start the debate on how to judge military decisions on morality
 yahaan angrez darshanik jerimi bantham kaa utiliterinism kaa siddhant major gogoi kaa bachaav kar saktaa he
 Bentham says that a judgment should be evaluated on the morality criterion based on the outcome of that decision
 bantham kaa tark he ki ham adhiktam logon ke liye adhiktam khushi dhundhen
 According to his reasoning, Major Gogoi's argument of saving many people along with army personnel can work
 mujhe nahin pataa ki major litul gogoi jerimi bantham or unki theory ko jaanate hai yaa farrukh daar ko jeep main baandhte vakt unhone bantham ke bare main sochaa hoga lekin jo tark unhone diya vah utiliterinism kaa siddhant hi he jise angrezi main consequencial moral rizaning kaha jaataa he yani aap apane krity ke parinaam ke aadhaar par naitikta tay karte hai
 The great philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, was also criticized for his theory, because this thinking ignores the rights of minorities (here the word means number is not from any religion) in a moral judgment, ie the death of a person
 If 100 people survive, Bentham's theory advocates that act
 duusari ore parth chatarji jis ore ishaara kar rahe hai vah german darshanik imenual kaant kaa siddhant he ki aakhri nattejey jo bhi hon aap kya kadam uthaate hai vahi aapaki naitikta kaa paimaana he
 On this basis, criticism of Major Gogoi and General Rawat is justified
 kaant ne apane siddhant main “moral worth” shabd kaa istemaal kiya yani vah puunji jo is baat kii parvaah nahin karti ki aakhir main aap buraai ko roak paayenge yaa acha parinaam hasil kar paayenge yaa nahin
 Kant says that the decision should be based on morality
 gandhi ji kii soch bi is bare main spashth rahi he ki saadhan or saadhy donon pavitra hone chahie
 Partha Chatterjee in his article says that Dyer forced Indians to crawl into the street of Amritsar in which a British woman was beaten
 diar ne apane bachaav main kaha ki aisa karnaa unka “daraavna” or “ganda farz” tha
 Partha Chatterjee puts these words of Dyer in front of an interview by General Vipin Rawat in which he has called the battle of Kashmir a "dirty war"
 lekin mangalvaar ko jo tasviren saamne ai unamem sena ke raajnneetikaran kaa ek sawaal uthaane par patrkaar sipiem netaa prakaash karaat ke peeche ye kah kar daud rahe the ki aap sena ke paksh main khadey hone se kyon hichak rahe hai
 Opposing the army is in the interest of the basic rights of the citizens of any country, then it should be opposed
 isamen deshadroh jaisi kya baat he
 The same thing is said with caution by former bureaucrat and author Pawan Verma
 verma ne kaha, “kisi bhi adhikari yaa sanstha par sawaal uthaaya ja saktaa he kyonki yahaan loktantr he
 Raising the question is not treason, but i will also say here in the same rhythm that Parth Chatterjee could have avoided the language he used
 ”tippaniyan What Verma is referring to is the metaphors used in Partha Chatterjee's article
 chatarji bhaawanaaon main bahakar na keval ek ativaadee tulana karte hai balki vah netaaon kii raajnneetik vifaltaa or kashmir main seemapar se chal rahe aatankwaad ko bilkul nazarandaaz kar dete hai
 The question is whether Partha Chatterjee could not have said the same without using the extras of comparison with General Dyer
 general diar or general vipin ravat kii saajha photo or lekh kaa sheershak shaayad parth ke puure tark ko dhundhala karata dikhataa he
 The author's attempt to shackle the society and those in power and awaken his conscience seems to stray in this exaggeration and the important question he loses at the end of his article is that as a nation, we are making such delicate turn But that can take us towards martial law i

 parth likhte hai ki general diar kaa bachaav british netaaon ne nahin kiya, lekin major gogoi kaa bachaav senadhyaksh ke saath sarkaar ke mantri bhi kar rahe hai
 Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu strongly criticized Partha Chatterjee's article, using words like parvarjan and idiotic
 patrakaron se ghire parth chatarji ne kaha vah kisi bhi aalochana kaa jawaab likhakar denge camaron ke saamne bolkar nahin
 Partha Chatterjee's article raises questions ranging from interviews with General Rawat to politicization of the army
 major litul gogoi ko sammanit karne ke baad general ravat ne apane intervyuu main ye tak kaha tha ki logon ko sena se darana chaiye
 In a democratic country like India, this statement of the Chief of Army Staff is frightening
 general ravat ne kaha – “aisi hi jang main aap naye tareeke dhundte hai
 You fight a dirty war by finding new ways
 agar mere afasar poochhate hai ki ham kya karen to kya mujhe unase kahana chaiye ki intazaar karo or mar jaao? main tumhaare liye ek badhiya coffin or tirangaa lekar aauungaa or tumhaare shav ko sammaan ke saath tumhaare parivaar waalon tak pahunchaa duungaa
 " general ravat kaa ye bayaan bhale hi sena kii majaburi or kathin halaat ke maddenzar major litul gogoi ke krity ko sahi tehraata ho lekin vah kai sawaalon ko dhundhala karne or unki andekhi karne kii koshish bhi he
 The picture of Farooq Ahmed Dar has now become an indelible part of the ongoing protest in Kashmir and this picture will continue to chase the Indian Army, claiming to be a disciplined and humane
 ye baat shaayad major gogoi or general ravat se behatar koi or nahin jaanata
 Perhaps that's why Parth Chatterjee in his article compares the same picture of Dar's human shield being made to that much-talked about Vietnam War
 jahaan ek 8 saal kii ladki bam se mili zakhmon ke saath sadak par daud rahi he
 You can easily find this picture in shame and showing the warped face of war
 chatarji ne apane lekh se jo sawaal uthaaye hai wo sena ke faislon ko naitikta kii kasuti par kasne kii bahes phir shuru karte hai
 Here the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham's theory of utilitarianism can defend Major Gogoi
 bantham kehete hai ki kisi faisle kaa naitikta kii kasuti par moolyankan us faisle ke parinaamon ke aadhaar par hona chaiye
 Bentham argues that we should seek maximum happiness for maximum people
 unke tark ke hisaab se sena ke javaanon ke saath kai logon ko bachaane kii major gogoi ne jo daleel di vah kaam kar sakati he
 i do not know if Major Leetul Gogoi knows Jeremy Bentham and his theory, or he may have thought of Bentham while tying Farrukh Dar in a jeep, but the argument he made is the principle of Utilitarianism, which is called Conventional Moral Reasoning in English That is, you decide morality based on the outcome of your act
 mahaan darshanik kahe jane vaale jerimi bantham kii apni is theory ke liye badi aalochana bhi hui kyonki yah soch kisi naitik faisle main alpsankhyakon (yahaan shabd kaa matlab number se he kisi dharm se nahin ) ke adhikaron ko andekha karti he yani ek vyakti ke marane se agar 100 log bachate hai to bantham kaa siddhant us krity kii vakaalat karata he
 On the other hand, what Partha Chatterjee is pointing out is the theory of German philosopher Emmanuel Kant that whatever action you take, whatever the final outcome is, is the measure of your morality
 is aadhaar par major gogoi or general ravat kii aalochana jaays he
 Kant used the term "moral worth" in his theory, capital that does not care whether you will be able to stop evil or achieve good results
 kaant kehete hai ki faisla naitikta ke aadhaar par hi hona chaiye
 Gandhiji has been clear about the idea that both means and means should be sacred
 apane lekh main parth chatarji kehete hai ki diar ne bharatiyon ko amritsar kii us gali main rengkar chalane par majaboor kiya jisamen ek british mahila kii pitayee hui thi
 Dyer said in his defense that doing so was his "horror" and "dirty duty"
 parth chatarji diar ke in shabdon ko general vipin ravat ke us intervyuu ke saamne rakhte hai jisamen unhone kashmir kii ladaai ko ek “darty war” kaha he
 But in the pictures which came out on Tuesday, the journalist was running behind CPM leader Prakash Karat on the question of politicizing the army, why are you hesitating to stand in favor of the army
 sena kaa virodh karnaa kisi desh desh ke nagarikon ke mul adhikaron ke hit main he to vah virodh kiya janaa chaiye
 What is there like treason in this? isi baat ko saavdhaanee ke saath kehete hai purv beurocret or lekhak pawan verma
 Varma said, "any officer or institution can be questioned because there is democracy here
" sawaal uthaanaa deshadroh nahin he lekin main yahaan par isi lay main ye bhi kahuunga ki parth chatarji ne jis bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya he usase vah batch sakate the
 "comments verma jis ore ishaara kar rahe hai vah parth chatarji ke lekh main istemaal kiye gayi rupakon kaa he
 Chatterjee not only makes an extreme comparison by drowning in sentiment, but he completely ignores the political failure of the leaders and the cross-border terrorism in Kashmir
 sawaal ye he ki kya parth chatarji general diar se tulana ke atirupakon kaa istemaal kiye bagaiyr yahi baat nahin kah sakate the
 Shared photos of General Dyer and General Vipin Rawat and the title of the article probably seem to blur Parth's entire argument
 samaaj or satta main baithe logon ko jhakzorne or unke zamir ko jagaane kii lekhak kii koshish is atishyokti main kahin bhatakati dikhti he or vah ahm sawaal kahin kho jaataa he jo vah apane lekh ke aakhir main uthaate hai ki raashtra ke taur par ham aise najuk mode par hai jo hamen pakistan kii tarah marshall lau yani sena kii hukumat kii ore le ja saktaa he
 Partha Chatterjee's article raises questions ranging from interviews with General Rawat to politicization of the army
 major litul gogoi ko sammanit karne ke baad general ravat ne apane intervyuu main ye tak kaha tha ki logon ko sena se darana chaiye
 In a democratic country like India, this statement of the Chief of Army Staff is frightening
 general ravat ne kaha – “aisi hi jang main aap naye tareeke dhundte hai
 You fight a dirty war by finding new ways
 agar mere afasar poochhate hai ki ham kya karen to kya mujhe unase kahana chaiye ki intazaar karo or mar jaao? main tumhaare liye ek badhiya coffin or tirangaa lekar aauungaa or tumhaare shav ko sammaan ke saath tumhaare parivaar waalon tak pahunchaa duungaa
 " general ravat kaa ye bayaan bhale hi sena kii majaburi or kathin halaat ke maddenzar major litul gogoi ke krity ko sahi tehraata ho lekin vah kai sawaalon ko dhundhala karne or unki andekhi karne kii koshish bhi he
 The picture of Farooq Ahmed Dar has now become an indelible part of the ongoing protest in Kashmir and this picture will continue to chase the Indian Army, claiming to be a disciplined and humane
 ye baat shaayad major gogoi or general ravat se behatar koi or nahin jaanata
 Perhaps that's why Parth Chatterjee in his article compares the same picture of Dar's human shield being made to that much-talked about Vietnam War
 jahaan ek 8 saal kii ladki bam se mili zakhmon ke saath sadak par daud rahi he
 You can easily find this picture in shame and showing the warped face of war
 chatarji ne apane lekh se jo sawaal uthaaye hai wo sena ke faislon ko naitikta kii kasuti par kasne kii bahes phir shuru karte hai
 Here the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham's theory of utilitarianism can defend Major Gogoi
 bantham kehete hai ki kisi faisle kaa naitikta kii kasuti par moolyankan us faisle ke parinaamon ke aadhaar par hona chaiye
 Bentham argues that we should seek maximum happiness for maximum people
 unke tark ke hisaab se sena ke javaanon ke saath kai logon ko bachaane kii major gogoi ne jo daleel di vah kaam kar sakati he
 i do not know if Major Leetul Gogoi knows Jeremy Bentham and his theory, or he may have thought of Bentham while tying Farrukh Dar in a jeep, but the argument he made is the principle of Utilitarianism, which is called Conventional Moral Reasoning in English That is, you decide morality based on the outcome of your act
 mahaan darshanik kahe jane vaale jerimi bantham kii apni is theory ke liye badi aalochana bhi hui kyonki yah soch kisi naitik faisle main alpsankhyakon (yahaan shabd kaa matlab number se he kisi dharm se nahin ) ke adhikaron ko andekha karti he yani ek vyakti ke marane se agar 100 log bachate hai to bantham kaa siddhant us krity kii vakaalat karata he
 On the other hand, what Partha Chatterjee is pointing out is the theory of German philosopher Emmanuel Kant that whatever action you take, whatever the final outcome is, is the measure of your morality
 is aadhaar par major gogoi or general ravat kii aalochana jaays he
 Kant used the term "moral worth" in his theory, capital that does not care whether you will be able to stop evil or achieve good results
 kaant kehete hai ki faisla naitikta ke aadhaar par hi hona chaiye
 Gandhiji has been clear about the idea that both means and means should be sacred
 apane lekh main parth chatarji kehete hai ki diar ne bharatiyon ko amritsar kii us gali main rengkar chalane par majaboor kiya jisamen ek british mahila kii pitayee hui thi
 Dyer said in his defense that doing so was his "horror" and "dirty duty"
 parth chatarji diar ke in shabdon ko general vipin ravat ke us intervyuu ke saamne rakhte hai jisamen unhone kashmir kii ladaai ko ek “darty war” kaha he
 But in the pictures which came out on Tuesday, the journalist was running behind CPM leader Prakash Karat on the question of politicizing the army, why are you hesitating to stand in favor of the army
 sena kaa virodh karnaa kisi desh desh ke nagarikon ke mul adhikaron ke hit main he to vah virodh kiya janaa chaiye
 What is there like treason in this? isi baat ko saavdhaanee ke saath kehete hai purv beurocret or lekhak pawan verma
 Varma said, "any officer or institution can be questioned because there is democracy here
" sawaal uthaanaa deshadroh nahin he lekin main yahaan par isi lay main ye bhi kahuunga ki parth chatarji ne jis bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya he usase vah batch sakate the
 "comments verma jis ore ishaara kar rahe hai vah parth chatarji ke lekh main istemaal kiye gayi rupakon kaa he
 Chatterjee not only makes an extreme comparison by drowning in sentiment, but he completely ignores the political failure of the leaders and the cross-border terrorism in Kashmir
 sawaal ye he ki kya parth chatarji general diar se tulana ke atirupakon kaa istemaal kiye bagaiyr yahi baat nahin kah sakate the
 Shared photos of General Dyer and General Vipin Rawat and the title of the article probably seem to blur Parth's entire argument
 samaaj or satta main baithe logon ko jhakzorne or unke zamir ko jagaane kii lekhak kii koshish is atishyokti main kahin bhatakati dikhti he or vah ahm sawaal kahin kho jaataa he jo vah apane lekh ke aakhir main uthaate hai ki raashtra ke taur par ham aise najuk mode par hai jo hamen pakistan kii tarah marshall lau yani sena kii hukumat kii ore le ja saktaa he
 General Rawat said - "in such a battle you find new ways
 aap ek gande yuddh ko naye tareekon ko khoj kar ladate hai
 If my officers ask what we should do, should i tell them to wait and die? i will bring you a nice coffin and tricolor and will carry your body with respect to your family members
 ” General Rawat's statement may justify Major letul Gogoi's act in view of the army's compulsions and difficult circumstances, but it is also an attempt to blur and ignore many questions
 farrukh ahamed daar kii tasviir ab kashmir main chal rahe virodh kaa ek amit hissaa ban chuki he or ye tasviir ek anushaasit or maanviya hone kaa daawa karne vaali bhartiya sena kaa peechha karti rahegi
 Perhaps no one knows this better than Major Gogoi and General Rawat
 shaayad isiliye apane lekh main parth chatarji daar ke maanav dhaal banaaye jane kii isi tasviir kii tulana vietnam war kii us bahucharchit tasviir se karte hai
 Where an 8-year-old girl is running on the road with bruises
 aap sharmasaar karne vaali or yuddh kaa vikrut cheharaa dikhaane vaali ye tasviir google main aasaani se dhund sakate hai
 The questions raised by Chatterjee in his article start the debate on how to judge military decisions on morality
 yahaan angrez darshanik jerimi bantham kaa utiliterinism kaa siddhant major gogoi kaa bachaav kar saktaa he
 Bentham says that a judgment should be evaluated on the morality criterion based on the outcome of that decision
 bantham kaa tark he ki ham adhiktam logon ke liye adhiktam khushi dhundhen
 According to his reasoning, Major Gogoi's argument of saving many people along with army personnel can work
 mujhe nahin pataa ki major litul gogoi jerimi bantham or unki theory ko jaanate hai yaa farrukh daar ko jeep main baandhte vakt unhone bantham ke bare main sochaa hoga lekin jo tark unhone diya vah utiliterinism kaa siddhant hi he jise angrezi main consequencial moral rizaning kaha jaataa he yani aap apane krity ke parinaam ke aadhaar par naitikta tay karte hai
 The great philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, was also criticized for his theory, because this thinking ignores the rights of minorities (here the word means number is not from any religion) in a moral judgment, ie the death of a person
 If 100 people survive, Bentham's theory advocates that act
 duusari ore parth chatarji jis ore ishaara kar rahe hai vah german darshanik imenual kaant kaa siddhant he ki aakhri nattejey jo bhi hon aap kya kadam uthaate hai vahi aapaki naitikta kaa paimaana he
 On this basis, criticism of Major Gogoi and General Rawat is justified
 kaant ne apane siddhant main “moral worth” shabd kaa istemaal kiya yani vah puunji jo is baat kii parvaah nahin karti ki aakhir main aap buraai ko roak paayenge yaa acha parinaam hasil kar paayenge yaa nahin
 Kant says that the decision should be based on morality
 gandhi ji kii soch bi is bare main spashth rahi he ki saadhan or saadhy donon pavitra hone chahie
 Partha Chatterjee in his article says that Dyer forced Indians to crawl into the street of Amritsar in which a British woman was beaten
 diar ne apane bachaav main kaha ki aisa karnaa unka “daraavna” or “ganda farz” tha
 Partha Chatterjee puts these words of Dyer in front of an interview by General Vipin Rawat in which he has called the battle of Kashmir a "dirty war"
 lekin mangalvaar ko jo tasviren saamne ai unamem sena ke raajnneetikaran kaa ek sawaal uthaane par patrkaar sipiem netaa prakaash karaat ke peeche ye kah kar daud rahe the ki aap sena ke paksh main khadey hone se kyon hichak rahe hai
 Opposing the army is in the interest of the basic rights of the citizens of any country, then it should be opposed
 isamen deshadroh jaisi kya baat he
 The same thing is said with caution by former bureaucrat and author Pawan Verma
 verma ne kaha, “kisi bhi adhikari yaa sanstha par sawaal uthaaya ja saktaa he kyonki yahaan loktantr he
 Raising the question is not treason, but i will also say here in the same rhythm that Parth Chatterjee could have avoided the language he used
 ”tippaniyan What Verma is referring to is the metaphors used in Partha Chatterjee's article
 chatarji bhaawanaaon main bahakar na keval ek ativaadee tulana karte hai balki vah netaaon kii raajnneetik vifaltaa or kashmir main seemapar se chal rahe aatankwaad ko bilkul nazarandaaz kar dete hai
 The question is whether Partha Chatterjee could not have said the same without using the extras of comparison with General Dyer
 general diar or general vipin ravat kii saajha photo or lekh kaa sheershak shaayad parth ke puure tark ko dhundhala karata dikhataa he
 The author's attempt to shackle the society and those in power and awaken his conscience seems to stray in this exaggeration and the important question he loses at the end of his article is that as a nation, we are making such delicate turn But that can take us towards martial law i
e
 military rule like Pakistan
 general ravat kaa ye bayaan bhale hi sena kii majaburi or kathin halaat ke maddenzar major litul gogoi ke krity ko sahi tehraata ho lekin vah kai sawaalon ko dhundhala karne or unki andekhi karne kii koshish bhi he
