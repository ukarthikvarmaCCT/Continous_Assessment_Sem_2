 "as much as Adityanath's critics are telling, the situation is not really as bad
 ve agar sanjidagi se kaam len to abhi sab kuch khatm nahin hua he
 The BJP leadership sees hope in Adityanath only when it comes with SP and BSP
 ve hi hindutv ke mudde ko aage le ja sakate hai
 According to the court's decision in the Ayodhya case, they can give the right direction
 is bich ve rajya kaa kaaphi daura kar chuke hai or feedback ke liye unhone apana khud kaa jamini network taiyaar kar liya he
 In a year he has also started to understand what needs to be done in the state
 (akhilesh ne bhi bahut dhimi gati se shuruyaat kii thi or mukhyamantri ke rup main pehla saal to chizon ko samajhane main hi nikal gaya tha
 ) First of all, the Chief Minister should stop believing the claims of officials regarding the progress of various schemes and monitor them privately and implement them effectively
 udhaaharan ke liye, shahari kshetron main choubison ghante bijli aapurti ke unke daavon kii tab khilli ud jaati he jab rajdhani lakhanu main hi lagaataar bijli gul hoti rahati he
 Likewise, his claim to pit state roads within 90 days proves false due to poor implementation
 adityanath ko mantriyon or adhikariyon kii ek aisi kor team bhi banani chahie jis par ve bharosa kar saken
 Asked if the Chief Minister is enjoying the role, Adityanath says, "it is clear in my mind that this chair is not for Anand
" main ise pradesh or raashtra kii seva ke liye mili kursi ke taur par letaa hum
 i have no personal life at all
 '' aane vaale maheenon main unhen dharmik or pakshpatpurna vichaaron se upar uthakar yah sabit karnaa hoga ki ek sanyasi rajya ko duusare ke mukaable zyada badhibia chalaa saktaa he

 bachapan se hi unhen ganit kaa bada shauk tha or unhone kam umr main hi ganit vishay main aitihaasik kaary karne shuru kar die the
 At the age of 12, he mastered trigonometry and also developed several theorems on his own without any help
 shuru se ganit main ruchi rakhane vaale ramanujan ko government arts college main padhai karne ke liye scolership mili thi, lekin baad main anya vishyon main kharaab pradarshan kii vajah se unhen iskaa phayda nahin mil sakaa
 He escaped from his home and enrolled at Pachaiyappa College in Madras
 jaaniye ganitagya shrinivas ramanujan se jude ye factskaha jaataa he ki ve bahut garib parivaar se the, jisaki vajah se unhen kai dikkaton kaa saamana bhi karnaa padataa tha
 After his studies, he worked as a clerk in the Madras Pors Trust
 unke athak prayaason ke baad saal 1913 main unki kismat ke daravaaje khule
 In fact, he was called to London by the British mathematician GH Hardy and after that he started a special work on mathematics
 mahaan vaigyanik stephen hawking ke liye bhi auraten thim abujh paheli
 
 
 ! He received many honors and also held important positions in the Mathematics Society
 is tarah ramanujan ne kai nae-nae ganitiya sutara likhe or khaas baat ye he ki unhone ganit seekhney ke liye koi vishesh prashikshan nahin liya tha
 He told many things about mathematics
 33 varsh kii aayu main 26 april 1920 ko unka nidhan ho gaya tha

 Police found the remains of a burnt corpse on 23 May 2012
 laash is kadar jal gai thi ki uski shinaakht to dur usase judi koi bhi jaankaree milanaa mushkil tha
 Three years later, Indrani Mukherjee's driver Shyam Rai told the police that Indrani and Sanjeev, together with him, had killed Sheena and put her dead body here
 iske baad mumbai police is cese se jude thos subut jutaney main jute gai
 Mumbai police reached Pen on Friday
 jahaan kankal mila tha us jagah kii khudaai shuru hui
 The police also found some bones
 isi bich pataa chalaa ki may 2012 main pen police ne jeje aspataal main jis laash ke avshesh bhijwaaye the ve aspataal main surakshit the
 The comments jeje aspataal ke dean dow lahane ne kaha ki aspataal ne avshesh sambhalakar rakhe the or 2013 main police ko report bhi de di thi
 Dr
 Lahane said that until the police do not say, the hospital handles the remains in such cases
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki chunki shav buree tarah se jal chukaa tha, aise main kuch bhi pataa laganaa mushkil tha
 But now the bone tissue of the remains can be detected by testing whether the DNA matches the Bohra family and whether the corpse belongs to Sheena
 maamla teen saal purana hone kii vajah se police kii mushkilen bad rahi hai
 In such a situation, important evidence such as call data records will not be found
 lekin agar police narco yaa poligraph test kii maang kare to yah ek ahm kadi ho sakati he
 Everyone has their own version of this story
 lagbhag har kirdaar ke paas qatl kii vajah he
 In such a situation, scientific evidence is the most concrete evidence with the police
 police ko 23 may 2012 ko ek jali hui laash ke avshesh mili the
 The corpse was so burnt that it was difficult to get any information related to it
 teen saal baad indrani mukherjee ke dryver shyaam raay ne police ko bataaya ki indrani or sanjeev ne uske saath milakar shina ko markar usko laash ko yahaan thikaane lagaaya tha
 After this, the Mumbai Police started gathering solid evidence related to this case

 Meanwhile, it was revealed that the corpse whose remains were sent to the JJ Hospital in May 2012 were safe in the hospital

 dow lahane ne kaha ki jab tak police nahin kahati, aspataal is tarah ke maamalon main avshesh sambhaal ke rakhti he
 He also said that since the body was badly burnt, it was difficult to detect anything
 lekin ab avshesh ke bone tishyu ko test karke pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he ki diene bohara parivaar se mail khate hai yaa nahin or yah laash shina kii he yaa nahin
 Police is facing difficulties due to the case being three years old
 aise main kol data record jaise ahm saboot nahin mil paaenge
 But if the police demand a narco or polygraph test then it can be an important link
 har kisi ke paas is kahani kaa apana varjan he
 Almost every character has a reason for murder
 aise main police ke paas scientific avidence hi sabase thos saboot hai

 mamata banerjee ne 19 march ko ek televijan intervyuu main dinesh trivedi ko hataane kaa vicitra tark diya
 He said, (trivedi) expelled our peon
 ’ chaparasi darasal ek mubir tha jise didi ne rail bhawan sthit trivedi ke daftar main rakhaa hua tha
 When he replaced Mamta as Railway Minister in July 2011 and retained most of the staff of his political boss, he did not know that he was also a peon
 unhen chaparasi kii haisiyat kaa pataa us samay chalaa jab unhone use ek mahila aagatuk ke saath budtamiji karne par apane offis se hataa diya
 The peon's story is merely an indication of the relationship between Trivedi and his political boss
 mamata ko hameshaa andeh rahaa ki unke vot se jeetne vaale trivedi dil se congress ke saath hai
 Lutyens' ousted peon in Delhi is more qualified than a sacked cabinet minister in this season of summer of discontent
 cabinet mantri kaa aparaadh keval itnaa tha ki unke paas railway ke aadhunikeekaran ke liye ek yojana thi
 As the summer progresses, the badly scorched UPA government is not getting any help from anywhere
 isliye use apane tejatarraar mitra dalon kii dayaa par nirbhar rahanaa pad rahaa he
 Mamata, a strong but temperamental leader of the Trinamool Congress (TMC), a friend group, is making the Prime Minister dance to her difficult tunes
 pradhanmantri kaa har ladkadhaata kadam is baat kaa sanket he ki ve apni kursi bachaane ke liye kis had tak ja sakate hai
 When Mamta asked for the removal of the adventurous Dinesh Trivedi, Manmohan Singh kneeled down and accepted her demand
 mamata communiston se bengal jeetne ke baad se hi dilli par kahar barapa rahi hai
 His every craze, every jolt is a demonstration of strength as he has 19 mps
 khastahal upie sarkaar ko satta main bane rahane ke liye unka samarthan jaruri he
 If Mamata wants to amend the Land Acquisition Bill, the amendment will definitely take place
 jab ve bangladesh ke saath tista jal bantwaare par apni asahmati se pradhanmantri ko sharmasaar karnaa chahengi to manmohan unke bina dhaka jaaenge
 When she does not want to attend the meeting of the National Integration Council, she will not attend
 jab ve samaan vichaar vaale duusare logon ke saath retail main videshi nivesh kaa virodh karengi to centre apni yojana ko thande baste main daal degaa
 When she wants to replace a leader like Mukul Rai with Trivedi, she will make him sit
 ve chaahati thim ki rail haada kam ho jaae, so ho gaya
 So, it has now been accepted that the angry sister had complete freedom to interfere in the UPA government
 lekin upie sarkaar ko apni marji se kuch karne kii aazaadee nahin he
 Didi can do this because she is standing on the summit and the UPA is dead
 yadi ve ek utaavle jan netaa kii param shakti kii moort rup hai to upie bikharane kii kagaar par khadey ghar kii tarah he
 They are the direct representatives of the newly fueled Allies who are ready to attack, but not to kill
 mara hua upie sahyogi dalon ke hiton ko puraa nahin karegaa, lekin dilli main ladkadaati, chatpataati, praanon kii bheekh maangati sarkaar unki har khwaahish puri karegi
 Whatever price they want, they will get a little bargain
 isaki behtareen misaal yojana ayog ke 19 march ke faisle par unka rosh he
 The Planning Commission raised the poverty line in urban areas to Rs 32 in 2011
 prati vyakti se ghataakar 28 ru
 And Rs 26 in rural areas
 se ghataakar 22 ru
 Had decided to do
 nai kasuti darshaati he ki garibi ghati he
 In the year 2004-05, 37 percent of the population was poor, which came down to about 30 percent in 2009-10
 samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ne 21 march ko sansad ke baahar kaha, ‘iske liye pradhanmantri manmohan singh jimmedaar hai kyonki ve yojana ayog ke adhyaksh hai
 He should remove Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia
 aankade puri tarah se galat hai
 The constituents of the UPA have been aggressive at a time when the people of India are in an anti-incumbency mood
 is maheene ke shuru main uttar pradesh kaa spasht janadesh or 21 march ke up-chunaav nattejey is baat ke sanket hai ki sattadhari partiyon ke khilaaf logon main rosh he
 The constituents of the UPA want to attack him when he is absolutely weak
 or upie aaj jitna kamjor he, utana pehle kabhi nahin rahaa
 But Mamta is not alone in this strategy
 yah baat digar he ki ve sabase mukhar hai
 Soon after the President's address to the Lok Sabha on 19 March, when Manmohan Singh gave a happy reply, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) President Sharad Pawar said that he was hurt by some remarks of the Prime Minister
 pradhanmantri ne kaha tha, ‘mere khyaal se mananeey sadsy bhi mahasoos karte hai ki hamaari gathbandhan sarkaar hone ke kaaran mushkil faisle lenaa or bhi mushkil ho jaataa he
 We have to formulate a policy keeping in mind the need to maintain consensus
 ’yah ghatak dalon ke khilaaf koi kadaa bayaan nahin tha, phir bhi aam taur par shant rahane vaale maratha netaa aahat ho gaye
 a day later, Pawar told the media that some members of her party complained to her that the NCP along with other partners were also targeted aimlessly while she did not pose any trouble
 pavaar ne kaha, ‘ensipi pichley 7-8 varshon se congress ke saath he, lekin ek bhi aisi misaal nahin he jab hamane gaiyr-jimmedaarana tareeke se vyavhaar kiya ho
 We have never boycotted Parliament or Cabinet meetings
 jab ham nitigat muddon par charchaa ke liye baithte hai to matbhedon kaa hona swaabhaavik he
 But once the cabinet has decided, we have never publicly opposed it
 pradhanmantri ke sapaat bayaan se ham aahat or dukhi hai
 This is the first time in eight years of supporting the UPA that Pawar has expressed his anguish
 pavaar lagbhag sabhi nitiyon par sarkaar ke kattar samarthak rahe hai
 Despite this, he believes that the government has ignored his views on many issues that are important to him as the country's agriculture minister
 khaadya suraksha vidheyak, kapaas or pyaaj ke niryaat par pratibandh lagane kaa faisla or beati-bangan ko anumati dena isaki misaal hai
 The Commerce Ministry decided to ban the export of cotton without consulting Pawar
 pavaar ne gusse main jab iskaa virodh kiya to sarkaar ne yah faisla waapas le liya kyonki vah ek or ghatak ko naaraaz nahin karnaa chaahati thi
 The news coming from Lucknow is also not reassuring
 apane 22 saansadon ke saath sapa congress ko baahar se samarthan de rahi he
 Some Congress leaders were hoping to bring Mulayam in place of Mamta in private conversations
 unki ummid us samay bad gai jab mulaayam (or mayawati) ne 19 march ko raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par laae gaye dhanyavad prastaav par sarkaar ko bachaa liya
 TMC walked out on the issue of National Counter Terrorism Center but Mayawati and Mulayam supported the government
 lekin congress kii ummid us samay tut gai jab usee din dopaher baad mulaayam ne kaha ki unki dilchaspee mamata kii jagah lene main nahin he
 He asked, "what is the point of joining the government for a year?" He made it clear that to keep the BJP away from power, he would continue to give support to the government from outside, based on the issue
 mulaayam singh ne ‘ek saal’ kyon kaha? sarkaar ke to abhi do saal bache hai
 Is this a miss or a message? a SP leader says, 'see, how we treated us after that when we saved them on the nuclear deal proposal
 ham loksabhaa chunaav main unke saath gathjod karnaa chaahate the, lekin unhone koi dilchaspee nahin dikhaai
 Mulayam's refusal hides an important message: UPA 2's government is no longer in power
 vah vahaan keval bani hui he or baahar jane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 The second reason for the dissatisfaction of the constituents is Rahul Gandhi
 beemaari ke kaaran sonia aaraam kar rahi hai, aise main congress apane mitra dalon ko thik se nahin sambhaal paa rahi he
 Whether m
 karunanidhi hon yaa mamata, sonia sabake saath vyaktigat sambandh banaae rakhane main maahir hai
 Mamta first met Sonia when she came to Delhi after her victory in 2011
 sonia ne unhen gale lagaaya
 When the reporters asked Mamta about this, their reply was, 'I have very good relations with Rajiv Gandhi's family
 ’ lekin rahul ke saath unki ghanishthata nahin he
 Rahul did not initiate a personal relationship with any regional leader except Omar Abdullah
 ghatak dalon kaa shakti pradarshan is baat kaa bhi sanket he ki congress main chunaav jeetne kii kshamta khatm hoti ja rahi he
 Alliance with Congress at the state level is no longer a strategy to win elections
 rashtriya lokdal (ralod) ke kuch netaaon kaa maananaa he ki yadi usne uttar pradesh main congress se gathbandhan nahin kiya hota to vidhansabha chunaav main party ko kuch or siten milteen
 The NCP believes that she became a victim of public outrage against the Congress Chief Minister in Goa
 maharashtra se ek ensipi vidhayak kehete hai, ‘ensipi-congress gathbandhan goa main congress ke kaaran haara
 Despite being a cabinet minister in the RLD government, he sits in opposition
 raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par vot ke dauraan naagarik uddyan mantri ajit singh ko vahaan se daudkar apni nirdhaarit seat par janaa padaa
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Bansal has been talking about coordinating meetings with the constituents at least three times a week, but he needs to improve himself
 masalan, unhen sabase pehle sansad main apane seating chart ko durust karnaa hoga
 An NCP MP says, "congress should stop treating the government like its own private property
 mamata isiilie naaraaz hai
 Alliance means participation in power by proportion
 congress sochati he ki hamen mantri banaakar usne hamaare upar upkaar kiya he
 Give one such example when someone has been appointed Governor, Ambassador or Chairman of a Commission on the recommendation of constituents
 congress ne sab apane paas rakhaa he
 'now the Congress can remain in power only by kneeling in front of its partners, especially Mamata
 mamata jaldbaaji main hai
 The velocity of their anger is determined not by pressure in Delhi but from Bengal
 unhone bhale hi pichley saal duniya ke ek sabase lambey communist shashan ko haraa diya ho, lekin chatur raajnneetijna hone ke kaaran ve jaanati hai ki satta main teen dashakon tak unka rahanaa naammumkin he
 She is considered a working woman in rural areas of Bengal

 Even in living they can embarrass the average comrade
 ve apane trademark coton kii mudi-tudi sari or rabad kii chappal main sanyasini samaajawaadee lagati hai
 So while Trivedi was presenting an 'anti-poor' railway budget in Parliament, Didi was far away, in Nandigram, her stronghold and strengthening her relationship with the people
 unhone trivedi ke barkhaast kiye jane kii ghoshnaa ek jansabha main kii
 Mamta can detect every trick of her traditional enemy Marxists
 apane gaiyr-bharosemand saajheedaar congress se ve sajag rahati hi hai
 Mamta knows that the plan of the Congress is to capture the anti-communist space and form its government in West Bengal
 uski yah yojana chaahe jitani mahatvakankshi ho, lekin yah tejatarraar mukhyamantri ab tak congress par bees hi sabit hui hai
 Mamta will have to keep the Congress dancing to her tune
 isi se congress kii qamar tuutegi

 Once again in the national capital Delhi, a case of brutal beating of a student by a teacher has come up
 vaise to adhyapakon ko vidhyaarthiyon ke saath marpet kii anumati hi nahin he
 Despite this, such teachers are often seen who take out their frustrations on their students and treat them like a teacher, not as a teacher
 rajdhani dilli main saamne aayaa yah nayaa maamla isi tarah kaa he
 In a government school located in Khajuri Khas area of east Delhi, a student studying in the sixth standard was beaten so hard that the student's hand fractured

 In his long career, these modernist painters had to face severe criticism at some time, and sometimes people tied bridges of praise
 raza ne hi paintig main pehle aadhuniktaa ke rang sajaae the
 Born in 1922 in Madhya Pradesh's Mandla district, Raza was the son of a ranger and grew up in the lap of nature amidst the same multicolored elements that later emerged from his brush
 painting kii disha main badhate unke kadamon ko maaloom tha ki unhen kalakaaron kii kam se kam do peedhishon kaa prakaash stambh bananaa he
 His family moved to Pakistan during Partition, but they stayed here
 isi samay kashmir kii vaadiyon ke unke chitron ne paris kii kala birdari ke saath unke judaav kii buniyaad rakhi
 Raza arrived in Paris in 1950 with the Progressive Artist Group's inability to understand the nuances of modern art

 Raza was extremely successful
 unke chitron ko bade sangrahakartaaon ne kharida
 "in his early days in Paris, Raza painted a different kind of painting in the shadow of the sun, under the sun, in the shadow of the lonely city, Hot de
 cagne (1951), jalte ped-paudhon ke bich dhahte ghar jaisi painting ke saath unki kuchi kii adbhut pratibha kaa jaadu chaane laga tha
 In 1956 he was awarded the prestigious Pri de la Critique
 yah pal bharat kii choti lekin kala ke behad mahatvapurn daur kaa sanket tha
 After settling in Paris in the '50s, Raza became an icon of the international success of an Indian artist who offered both suggestions and hospitality to Hussain, Ram Kumar, Krishna Khanna and a new plant of young artists
 '60 ke dashak ke aakhri daur or '70 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main raza kii chitra style main vividh samskritiyon or shaileyon kaa manohar sanyog dikhaai detaa he
 His homeland mandala retains a new look with his house in Gorbioin, France, and the canvas features a multi-colored combination of Indian system symbols and international geometric shapes

 His teacher in Mandla taught him to concentrate on a dot on the wall to concentrate the mind in studies
 varshon baad, us bindi ne brahmad ke kaale surya or bindu ke rup main vistaar kar liya
 The flexible lines inspired by the Russian painter Nicholas de Stel, introduced in his abstract portrait, paved the way for his characteristic portrait style of round circles, squares and inverted triangle shapes, reflecting both of his inspirations to which he was paying homage
 yah ek shaashvat bhashaa he jisamen bindu ek plastic swaroop he jo beej se brahmad tak paimaane or pratik ke vyapak kavy ko vyakt karata he
 "his expression was impeccable," says Krishna Khanna, one of Raza's close and associate Progressive Artists Group
 ve vastav main is desh ke sachche bete the
 "" In the 90s, Raza decorated the symbols raised from his native land in colors
 buniyadi siddhanton ke rup main gol ghere? suraj, varg or trikon ke saath unke kadam bhartiya chitrakaari kii unki pasandida style mandal, kundalini yaa naad or chamakdaar rangon kii prishthbhumi main kavita or vaakyon ke istemaal kii ore badi
 They used acrylic dyes, which dry quickly and create a large number of paintings
 raza ko varsh 1997 main kalidas sammaan or 2013 main padam vibhushan se sammanit kiya gaya
 After 60 years in Paris, Raza returned to India after the death of his wife Jeannie
 80 saal kaa yah bujurg kalakaar apane chitron main antaheen badhate golakaar gheron kii tarah apane vajood se pare pahunch jaataa tha
 The person who had reached the Raza Foundation in the last decade would have found him sitting in front of his canvas

 It was during these years that Raza laid the foundation of the Raza Foundation (2001)

 a few months ago, there was a ruckus about the removal of chapters related to the lives of Sikhism teachers from these history books, but now there has also been controversy over the new books and chapters uploaded by the Education Department on its website online
 vahishkali dalka aarope he ki in kitabon main sikh guruon ko lekar aapattijanak shabdaawalee kaa istemaal kiya gaya he or kai tathyon ko yaa to jaan-boojhkar hataa diya gaya he yaa phir tod-marod kar adhuri jaankaree ke saath kitabon main likhaa gaya he
 The Akali Dal alleges that the Punjab Board of Education and the Ministry of Education are misrepresenting the history of Sikh Gurus to students by deliberately making such mistakes one after the other
 akali dal ne jald hi in nai aplod kii gai kitabon or unke chaptaron ko hataane kii maang kii he
 They allege that some such mistakes have been made in these books regarding Sikh religious leaders
 jaise:-- guru arjuna dev ji kii shahadat nahin hui thi balki unako mughal shaskaon ne jurmaana bharva kar chhod diya tha
 - Guru Hargobind Singh ji was fond of hunting and used to give preference to the wicked instead of devotees
 - guru govind singh ji chamkaur sahib kii ladaai ko bich main chhodkar chupchaap chale gaye the
 - There are allegations of tampering of facts in the course and removal of many important facts about Guru Tegh Bahadur Sahib
 - guru govind singh ji ne ek gaanv ko lutaa thine jaise kai or tathy he joki itihaas ke chaptaron main likhe gaye hai or inhen baton ko lekar akali dal ko kadaa aitraaj he
 After such mistakes are revealed, where another Punjab Education Board and Education Minister are on the backfoot and have completely kept silence, then the spokesperson of Punjab Congress is also admitting to the mistake in this case and by conducting an investigation Talking about the removal of such chapters
 punjab congress ke pravaktaa rajkumaar verka us sawaal kaa jawaab nahin de paae jisamen unase poocha gaya ki baar-baar punjab shiksha board kii 11veen or 12veen kii itihaas kii kitabon main sikh dharm guruon ko lekar is tarah kii galtiyaan saamne kyon aa rahi hai?pehle bhi ho chuki hai galtiyaanpunjab shiksha board isse pehle bhi kai baar is tarah kii galtiyaan kar chukaa he jisamen sikh dharm guruon se jude chaptaron ko yaa to hataa diya gaya yaa galat jaankariyaan di gai
 Now the way the mistakes have been repeated in the same way again, it is bound to raise the question that despite all the academics and history experts, why are such mistakes in the Punjab Education Board books repeatedly
 Huh

 China's official media said on Saturday that the demand for autonomy by the exiled Tibetan government as a 'middle way' is a 'futile attempt' to gain legitimacy

 ' Shankaracharyaswaroopananda Saraswati has once again attacked Sai

 Taking a dig at the expenses of the Sai Trust's centenary program, Shankaracharya said that the trust should use the money for the welfare of farmers

 Now why a statue of a Muslim is being put in our temples after India's independence
 sai kii murti kyon rakh rahe ho
 No government stops while keeping it, it stops when they are fired

 Shankaracharya said that Sai is a firm Muslim

 12 What will be the nature of foundation course? What is the use of half-incomplete knowledge of subjects in which specialization is not required? Where will the infrastructure come from to teach 55,000 fourth-year students (about the same number of students enrolled in DU every year)? Who will bear the increased fees of one year and living expenses in Delhi? Will parents wait four years for girls to get married and be willing to spend so much money on a girl's education? This basic question of Justin, associate professor of history at Hansraj College, is perhaps the legitimate answer to this debate - 'education for the poor, dalits and girls is the only way through which they can change their lives, but is this decision the same Will you not get further away from education?

 com / vtrr7khqnp— Veere Di Wedding (@vdwthefilm)september 14, 2017 Book: Teresaaz Man and Other Stories from Goa (story Collection) Author: Damodar Maujoprakash: Rupa Publication Price: 174 rupees Khushan is the lucky person who thinks, dreams and writes in his mother-dialect
 un deshon main lokapriy manyata bhi aisi hi he
 People's language and language are fighting against the linguistic army of Western imperialism
 bharat main yah samrajyavaadee sthaan angreji kaa he
 Damodar Maujo, who writes in Konkani, is one such writer
 konkani un puraani or vajandaar 22 bhashaaon main shaamil he jinhen samvidhan kii aathvin anusuchee main aupchaarik darja diya gaya
 Konkani is also found with Marathi in the southern branch of the indo-aryan tree of the language
 yah goa kii aupchaarik bhashaa he or hinduon or isaayiyon ke saath dakshin goa or malabar tat ke kuch musalmaan samooh bhi iskaa istemaal karte hai
 This expansion of Konkani was made possible through the Portuguese
 unhone apane aupniveshik hit se bhi zyada bhashaai vistaar par jor diya or pradhan brahman krishak varg ko bhi iskaa istemaal karne par majaboor kar diya
 The author is a Konkani speaking from Mangalore
 yah ilaaka bhi chid ke pedo se bhare goa kii tarah haraa-bharaa he
 There is also a beach where a lot of love for spicy fish curry is preserved
 goa main, konkani or uske lokgeeton kaa raaj chalata he lekin mangalore main isane kannada or tulu se kaaphi kuch sikhkar bolne kii dhvaniyon main use samahit kar liya he
 Damodar Maujo's collection of short stories 'teresaaz Man and Other Stories from Goa' has been published by Rupa Publications
 yah lekhak ko mangalore main bitaye gaye bachapan kii yaadon se chakit karte aaine kii tarah he
 There is a character in this story who takes a bath with a large bronze pot
 iske liye pani ghar ke kuen se laayaa jaataa he or use chid kii sukhi pattiyon kii aanch par garm kiya jaataa he
 This was before the time when electricity in the villages of India did not start coming to its required voltage
 bachapan ke yaad-chitron ke alaava is kitaab main ve kahaniyaan hai jo ek vikshobh vaale samaaj main janm leti hai
 Trembling in its traditional mold and yet in a bursting society
 kahaniyon kaa majamoon auraton kii aakankshaon kii tarah mukhtaliff tarah kaa he
 Whether it is the kiss of a woman frustrated by her husband's disinterest, the second story has a drunken-cuckold boasting of manhood beating the working wife, or the vagaries of faith in the villages, as if the skirt of poverty is only as high as the width of a thread it occurs
 isi kitaab main aap paaenge, gaanv ke kuch kam padhe-likhe chaalaak logon kaa satahi aatmavishvaas, kasbon ke maahaul or usase upja jhootha gurur, raajnneetik dabaav or haaavee hone kii koshish or pati kii nirankushta par patni kii gupt bailat se hasil kii gai jeet
 Modernity is mentioned again and again, but ultimately each time it proves to be the male-dominant that is perhaps the oldest system in the world
 purush hameshaa khud ko pradhan rakhana chahta he lekin mahilaayein sirf kisi tarah apane pati or bacchon ke paalan-poshan main vyast rahati hai
 And if there are animals in the house, then keep them
 mahila ko apane ird-gird kii har cheez, yahaan tak ki jaanavar se bhi pyaar karnaa padataa he
 But his love is more of necessity because the remaining money in the boxes is gone and sowing of paddy in the fields is necessary
 agar koi in strivadi panktiyon kii aalochana karegaa, to maujo ke khilaaf shikaayat or saaf ubhar kar aegi
 But like all writers, Maujo seems bound by the limitations of language, its worldview and craft
 un par kisi nariwadi prahaar ko pratikriya ke laayak bhi nahin samajha jayega or use turant khaarij kar diya jayega
 Some political references of Jayalalithaa and Mamta are also mentioned, but go away blurred
 lekin kuch or chijen hai, jin par dhyaan jaataa he
 Exclusive rights for example
 garibi se trast ek charvaahe kii kahani he jo apane maveshi bechakar bhi apane parivaar ke paalan-poshan ke saadhan nahin juta paata or unhen chhod jaataa he
 Is this a pointed story? The book references a boy's adolescent and erotic love for a girl from a backward caste
 yahaan premi jodon kii shaadi ke liye bail beche jate hai
 The boy's name is Halsiddu and the girl's Anshi
 jab halasiddu apane pyaar ke bare main bataata he to uske pita use daant dete hai, 'yah kaise ho saktaa he? ve maanga hai, ham mahaar hai
 'halasiddu's mother says,' Manga comes down from us
 par wo khud ko hamase upar maanate hai
 'later, the boy surprises his parents by calling on BR Ambedkar's soul
 unke mata-pita ne ambedkar ke naam par hi use skool kii ahmiyat samajhaaii thi
 The story ends not on the wedding, but on the beating of the shepherd by the anti-cow slaughter crowd
 or ant main vah un logon ko kosta rah jaataa he jo jaanwaron se pyaar karte hai lekin insaanon ko peetate hai
 There is no mention of casteism in the Konkan society, which is as deep and intact as Manu had left it
 kitaab kii aakhri kahani he 'a riters tail
 'how a writer becomes a story for another writer at a literature conference in Delhi
 par is baar ek lekhak or manovaigyanik marij se
 Prejudice, prejudice and some more prejudice
 yaa ho saktaa he ki kahani 'sirf' ek kahani ho, haalanki yah usase kahin zyada hoti he
 Moujo probably has a mirror in his hand, but he is not looking at her
 goa main 60 saal kii ek mahila kii kyasanur forest dijis (keendi) se maut ho gai
 KFD is commonly called Monkey Fever and this is the first case of death from Monkey Fever in the state this year

 tippaniyan Health Minister Francis d'souza had earlier said in the state assembly that the government has launched a vaccination campaign in these villages, but the response is not encouraging
 keendi virus kii vajah se hone vaala hemorage bukhaar he jo dakshin asia main failata he
 In India, for the first time in 1957, the disease was reported in the Kisanur forest in Karnataka
 iske baad bandar isaki chapet main aae or kai kii jaan chali gai
 Since then, the locals started calling the disease a "monkey fever"
 rajya main mahadei vanyajeev abhayaarany se lage uttar purvi hisse ke sattari taluka ke antargat aane vaale mauxi, jarmen, copordem, budrak, karmali or saleli gaanvon main yah bukhaar failaa hua he
 He said that Desai, who lives in Mouxi, was admitted to the Primary Health Center in Valpoi on January 11 after complaining of fever

 The former defense minister accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of using central agencies to 'fabricate lies'
 antni ne media se baatcheet ke dauraan kaha, 'jhooth par jhooth, ve (bhaajapa) kuch nahin se kuch gadhana chaahate hai
 They are misusing agencies to fabricate lies
 ' unhone kaha, 'main saaf taur par kahana chahta hum ki sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ne kabhi raksha saudon main hastkshep nahin kiya

 Amid the ongoing debate on the issue of 'triple talaq' across the country, Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu said that this practice should stop because it is harming women
 shahari vikaas mantri ne kaha ki vidhi ayog or supreme court ne teen talaak kii pratha par janata se raay maangi he or charchaa karaane kii baat kahi he
 Naidu said, after discussion, the Government of India has voted that the triple talaq is not in the interest of women
 ise khatm hona chahie
 Naidu's statement is significant in the sense that many Muslim organizations and leaders, including members of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, are insisting that 'sharia law cannot be changed

 On 7 October last, the Center opposed the triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy practices issued by Muslims in the Supreme Court and advocated a re-look at them on the basis of gender equality and secularism
 tippaniyan The Law and Justice Ministry, in its affidavit, cited gender equality, secularism, international rules, religious practices and martial law in various Islamic countries, saying that the apex court should pass a fresh judgment on the issue of triple talaq and polygamy

 com / l19zemlm7u dilli ko chalaane vaale teen chehre (arvind kejariwal, najeeb jang or susheel kumaar scindia) is kadar ulajh chuke hai ki dilli chalegi kaise or sarkaar bachegi kitne ghante ye sawaal bada hota ja rahaa he
 Chief Minister Kejriwal is calling for the public and asking questions to get the Jan Lokpal Bill passed in the stadium
 up-rajyapal najeeb jang jan lokapal ko lekar tranjaction bijness niyam kii duhai de rahe hai or sawaal stadium main suraksha vyavastha na de paane ke dilli police kii chitthee par kar rahe hai
 Home Minister Shinde has been raising the question on the working methods of Kejriwal by citing the Constitution
 to phir dilli kaa rasta jaataa kidar he?kejariwal bina janalokapal ke rah nahin sakate
 The Delhi Police cannot allow Kejriwal to convene the assembly session at the stadium after his decision
 scindia centre ke kanoon or siyasat se bandhe hai, jiskaa chhattis kaa aankada kejariwal se he
 If Kejriwal leaves the chair on the question of Jan Lokpal and falls in the election field, then in a jolt he will become a hero among the voters of Delhi
 lekin tab kejariwal kii ladaai phir dilli main hi simat jaaegi or dilli kii satta raashtrapati shashan ke jariye alji ke haath main aa jaaegi
 At that time, LG will try to beat Kejriwal's era with his governance and Shind will help LG in running the power of Delhi
 kyonki ek taraf istipha dekar chunaav maidan main kejariwal ke kudane kaa matlab hoga agle chunaav main bahumat yani kam se kam 36 siten jeetna
 The indication is clear that in such a situation Kejriwal will surround LG, Shinde and the central government
 badi baat ye he ki yah kaam vah siem pad par bane rahakar hi kar sakate hai
 So the road to Delhi will get further complicated because the lg's agents are blaming the Delhi Police for not having an assembly session with the Jan Lokpal at Kejriwal Stadium, which means that the confrontation will gradually escalate
 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne sanshodhit naagarikta kanoon ke khilaaf rajya main vibhinn sthanon par hinsak pradarshan or todphod karne waalon ko shanivaar ko kadi karrwai kii chetavanee di
 Banerjee appealed to the people to maintain peace and perform in a democratic manner
 vahiin vipakshi partiyon ne trinmul congress sarkaar par sthiti ko niyantrit karne ke liye kuch nahin karne or rajya ko jalane dene kaa aarope lagaaya
 The Chief Minister issued a statement for the second time on Saturday, saying, "I again appeal to all of you not to commit violence and not disrupt public order and keep peace
" '' unhone kaha, sarkari or nijee sampatti main kisi bhi tarah kii todphod ko bardaasht nahin kiya jayega or kanoon ke mutabik sakhti se nipta jayega
 Banerjee said, "don't take the law into your own hands
" sadak or rail yatayaat jam mat kiijie
 Do not cause problems for common people on the streets
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘jo log pareshaaniyaan khadi karne ke doshi paye jaayenge, unke khilaaf kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 The Chief Minister reiterated that the revised Citizenship Act and the proposed nationwide NRC would have no impact in the state
 vipakshi bhaajapa or makapa ne banerjee kii apil par tikhi prakriya dete hue kaha ki rajya sarkaar halaat par kaabo paane main naakaam rahi he
 BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha said that if such a situation prevails then the party will have no other option but to demand imposition of President's rule in the state
 makapa ke rajya sachiv surya kaant mishra ne aarope lagaaya ki trinmul congress ne jaanboojhkar sthiti ko kaabo karne ke liye kuch nahin kiya

 in 25-26 agast ko pakistan main hone vaale vitt mantriyon ke saarc sammelan main vitt mantri arun jetali nahin jaaenge
 Amidst the ruckus caused by the rhetoric on Kashmir, the government has decided not to go to Pakistan for Arun Jaitley
 arun jetali kii bajaay ab bharat kaa pratinidhitiv aarthik maamalon ke sachiv shaktikant das karenge
 Through this, India has tried to give a strong message to Pakistan
 15 agast ko laal kile se bhi pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pakistan ko khari khari sunai thi
 On this occasion, Modi mentioned Bluechistan and Pakistan Occupied Kashmir
 grih mantri rajnath singh ke saath pakistan main grahamantriyon ke saarc sammehalan main thik vyavhaar na hone se bhi bharat kaaphi naaraaz tha
 However, Rajnath Singh had heard Pakistan strongly on the issue of terrorism
 vahaan par rajnath singh ne lunch bhi nahin kiya tha
 He had returned to Delhi after finishing his tour before time
 haalanki pakistan ne in sab chizon ke chalate vitt mantri arun jetali kaa swaagat garmjoshi se karne kii baat bhi kahi thi
 But Jaitley's visit has been canceled due to his dealings with Rajnath Singh and a strong message from Modi to Pakistan
 paak ne kaha- ham achche mejabaan kii bhoomika membharat-paak dwipaksheeya sambandhon main maujudshant maahaulake bich yah baithak 25 or 26 agast ko islamabad main honi he
 Recently, the officials of the Pakistani Finance Ministry said that during this time Pakistan's Finance Minister Isaac Dar could join hands with his Indian counterpart in a cordial manner
 pakistani vitt mantralay ne kaha, 'sarkaar ne aagaameeshaashchh sammelnaki taiyaariyon ko antim rup de diya he
 Pakistan will play the role of a good host and will try to keep the whole atmosphere positive
 'bina khaanaa khaae laut aae the rajnathgauratlab he ki isi maheene SAARC ke grih mantriyon kii baithak main maahaul us vakt tanaavpurn ho gaya tha jab, rajnath singh or pakistani grih mantri choudhary nisaar ali khan ke bich talkh bayaanbaji hui thi
 Rajnath returned from Pakistan without any food after the conference

 Calling BJP PM candidate Narendra Modi and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi a 'corrupt devil', Aam Aadmi Party leader Manish Sisodia said that it is very important that he be defeated in the Lok Sabha elections
 chunavi baithak main sisodiya ne kaha, ‘modi or rahul donon bhrasht dal ke shaitan hai
 Corruption cannot be eradicated while those people are in politics
 donon shaitan desh ko luutane main lage hue hai
 Targeting Priyanka Gandhi, Sisodia said that her allegation that you do not know Amethi is absolutely true
 unhone kaha, ‘yah sach he ki ham amethi ko nahin jaanate kyonki gandhi parivaar swatantraaa ke vakt se hi ise lut rahaa he
 It is true that the common man cannot know about it
 ’ unhone aarope lagaaya ki haalanki rahul mahilaon ke sammaan kii baat karte hai lekin unke apane sansadeey kshetra main mahilaon ko unka haq nahin mil rahaa he
 Sisodia said, 'here you are under attack on the representatives
 yahaan tak ki congress ke log mahila kaaryakartaaon ke saath hi abhadra vyavhaar kar rahe hai
 'he said that this time even Priyanka Gandhi cannot help Rahul win this seat
 chhattisgarh main jahaan naksali police javaanon ke khun ke pyaase hai or kadam-kadam par unke liye maut bicha rakhi he vahiin rajya police ke ek sipaahi ne ghayal inami naksali ko khun dekar uski jaan bachaai he
 In Surguja, a northern region of Chhattisgarh, Naxalites attacked the police team and a rewarded Naxal was injured in police retaliation
 lekin police ne is naksali ko marane ke liye nahin choda balki uskaa ilaaj karavaaya or jarurat padane par use khun bhi diya
 Superintendent of Police of Surguja district NKS Thakur says that on the 7th of this month, the police had received news that Naxalites had gathered near Chandni Bahar village in Surajpur police district and were trying to carry out any major incident
 chandani bahaar thana ke prabharee eses patel ke netritv main police dal jab jangal pahunchaa tab naksaliyon ne achaanak police dal par hamalaa kar diya or police ne bhi javaabi karrwai kii
 After retaliation by the police, the Naxalites fled the spot but Chandrika Yadav, a naxalite of ten thousand rupees, was injured
 thakur bataate hai ki chandrika ko sidhe chandani bahaar gaanv ke aspataal main laayaa gaya tab chikitsakon ne uske qamar main lagi goli or uski kharaab haalat ko dekhte hue sarguja jile ke mukhyalay ambikapur ke jila aspataal main bhartee karaane kii salaah di
 The Superintendent of Police says that the police team admitted Chandrika to the district hospital in Ambikapur, when the doctors demanded o positive blood for Chandrika but no immediate blood arrangements were made
 aise maukey par jila police bal ke sipaahi virendra singh ne chandrika ko khun diya or chikitsakon ne chandrika kaa safaltaapurvak oparation kiya
 At present, Chandrika's condition is out of danger and she will be questioned after doctors' permission
 thakur ne bataaya ki chandrika yadav kii ginati ek hardkor naksali ke rup main kii jaati he tathaa police ko uski lambey se talash thi
 There are several cases of robbery and attempt to murder against Chandrika and it has also worked in the team of Naxalite commander Basant Yadav
 ek naksali ko khun dekar jaan bachaane ke bare puche gaye sawaal par sipaahi virendra singh kehete hai ki chandrika ek naksali hone se pehle insaan he or ghayal insaan ko bachaana uskaa pehla kartavya he
 Here, Inspector General of Police PN Tiwari said that if this situation was with the Naxalites then the Naxalites would not miss killing the policemen because in such a case it is often seen that when the police personnel get caught in the naxalites, the Naxalites are gruesomely Kills them
 rajya ke varisht police adhikariyon ke mutabik naksaliyon ne pichley chaar saalon main lagbhag dedh hajaar logon kii hatya kii he jisamen kai police karmchaaree shaamil hai
 Giving new life to a naxalite by a soldier is a great compliment and it is enough to open the eyes for the Naxalites wandering in the way

 Rahul Gandhi changed the introduction of his Twitter account today
 congress adhyaksh hataa diya or vahaan congress kaa sadsy or saansad likh diya he
 He has also made a three-page letter public
 jisamen apana istipha likhaa he
 Now Motilal Vora has been appointed acting president for a month in place of Rahul Gandhi
 congress ke samvidhan ke anusaar kisi karanvash congress ke adhyaksh pad kaa istipha ho jaataa he tab varisht mahasachiv ko adhyaksh kii jimmedaari sanbhaalani hoti he
 Until the working committee elects a temporary chairman
 yah asthaayee adhyaksh tab tak hota he jab tak sthaayee rup se adhyaksh kaa chunaav nahin ho jaataa he
 Rahul Gandhi will not return to the post of Congress President
 kabhi nahin lautenge yah kayaas kaa vishay he lekin ve apni baat par kaayam he
 Who will be the new president, will be the de facto president or 'khadoon Marka' will be the chairman
 philhal rahul ke istife se zyaada congress ko samajhane kii zarurat he
 Rahul has resigned and challenged the Congress
 congress ne wo chunauti pichley paanch saal tak nahin lee
 There has been no challenge for 45 days
 kabhi jintend prasad jaise netaa the jinhone sonia gandhi ke khilaaf adhyaksh pad kaa chunaav ladaa tha
 This is the crisis of Congress
 kai rajya hai jahaan congress adhyaksh hai magar kaagaj par bane hue hai
 They have no possibility of becoming leaders and do not try to make them
 sabko lagata he ki ek din rahul gandhi yaa sonia gandhi chunaav jeeta denge or ve mantri ban jaaenge
 Till then, he is cutting his time and Congress time in the name of being in politics
 aap nazar daudaiye congress haar se post kam, sust zyaada nazar aati he
 The Congress system also has limited the possibility of becoming a leader within it
 use samaapt kar diya he
 At the moment, what appears on the remaining horizon of the Congress within which there is a hunger to bring the party to power, who thinks about politics, wins politics, behind which its allies stand
 sab ek jagah se aane vaale aadesh kaa intazaar karte hai or usee kii aas main congress main rahete hai or usee se naaraaz hokar congress chhod dete hai
 How easily many leaders left the Congress and joined the BJP
 aana janaa laga rahata he magar ek duusare dal main jane kii bechaini bataa rahi he ki congress ke kaaryakarta or netaa ke bheetar congress nahin he
 His ideology is very weak
 party main bache hue netaa party ke liye kam bijepi main jane ke liye zyaada bache hue hai
 If there was a Congress within them, they would have stopped
 congress ko jaanate
 Read, know Congress leaders
 darasal congress ke bheetar congress banane kii prakriya samaapt ho chuki he
 Congress general leaders could not even defend Nehru
 zaahir he ve raajnneeti main hote hue raajnneeti kii buniyadi kitabon se kitne dur ja chuke hai
 Rahul Gandhi's resignation is an opportunity for the Congress to be a party
 congress ko ab party hona hoga
 Where a leader can emerge, he can draw a new line of politics from his words
 jo netaa hai wo bas congress main bane hue he
 Congress shows less within them
 congress kaa sapana dikhaai nahin detaa he
 The rooms and chairs of the Congress office are visible
 mul rup se dekhen to aaj kii taarikh main congress aalsee party ho chuki he
 There is a lack of creativity within him
 uske paas parti ke taur par kaaryakartaaon or netaaon ko vyast rakhane ke liye raajnneetik rup se rachanaatmak kaarykram nahin hai
 Instead of becoming a leader in the court, the challenge is to become a leader in the field
 congress ko dekhnaa chahie ki uske bheetar se kitne netaa duusare dal main chale gaye or aaj bhi duusare dal main jane ke liye baichaiyn hai
 The Congress should think why its party is full of people who do not have Congress
 rahul gandhi jis idia aaf india kii baat karte hai, uski samaj unki party ke kitne netaaon main hai, kitne netaa aise hai jo unke idia aaf idia ko public main le ja sakate hai, janata ke bich do line bol sakate hai
 Therefore, even after Rahul's resignation, Congress leaders are retreating
 shaayad unhen apane congressi hone par kam bharosa he yaa phir congress par kam bharosa he
 The Congress party does not have to find an alternative to Rahul Gandhi, it has to find the way to politics
 1929 kaa kaisaa saal rahaa hoga jab lahore ke adhiveshan main jawahar laal nehru adhyaksh banate hai tab unki umr 40 saal thi
 By 1947, 45 presidents of Congress had been formed
 apni sthapana yani 1885 se lekar 1947 ke bich 58 baar adhyaksh badla
 The Congress was a vibrant political party then
 45 logon kaa adhyaksh banane kaa matlab he samay samay par alag alag pratibhaaon ke netaa kaa bananaa or ubharna
 Every president brought his new thought
 nai pratibha lekar aayaa
 Some failed after coming and some passed
 aaj wo prakriya band ho gai he
 Had it not been stopped, Rahul's option in the Congress would have been found immediately
 party bhale na dhund paa rahi ho lekin janata yaa kaaryakarta ko dikh jaataa ki rahul kii jagah hamaara adhyaksh yah bhi to ho saktaa he
 Do you hear any sound aaj 90 saal kii umr main motilaal vora ek maheene ke liye kaaryakari adhyaksh bane hai
 India was free when she was 18 years old
 sawaal he ki kya congress kaa adhyaksh koi nayaa hoga jo yuva bhi hoga yaa koi 70 saal kaa hoga
 Will it be Priyanka Gandhi or is there a talent that the Congress can portray as a surprise
 rahul gandhi ne istife main apni zimmedaari sweekaar kar lee
 The members of the Congress Working Committee have been requested to form a group of some people and start the search for a new president
 rahul gandhi ne likhaa he ki adhyaksh ke naate 2019 kii haar ke liye ve zimmedaar hai
 Accountability is essential for the future of the party
 isi kaaran se congress pad se istipha diya he
 He has written that the accountability of others also needs to be fixed, but how can it not be that the chairman is not accountable
 is patr main rahul ne likhaa he ki meraa sangharsh kabi bhi raajnneetik satta ke liye saadhaaran ladaai nahin rahaa
 i do not have any hatred or anger towards the BJP, but every step of the blood in my body instinctively resists the bjp's idea of india
 yah pratirodh isliye paidaa hota he kyonki meraa vajood jis bharat kii kalpana se bana he, uskaa takaraav bijepi ke bharat kii kalpana se he
 This is not a new fight
 hazaron saal se is dharti par jari he
 Where they see differences i see equality
 jahaan ve nafrat dekhte hai main prem dekhtaa hum
 i embrace where they see fear
 yah bharat kaa vichaar he jisaki ham raksha karenge
 The attack on the country and the constitution is being done to destroy the fabric of our country
 main kisi bhi tarah se is ladaai se peeche nahin hat rahaa hum
 i am a loyal Congressman and a devoted son of India
 apni antim saans tak uski seva or suraksha karata rahoonga
 As a leader and former president of a political party, Rahul Gandhi has written his views, but was Rahul Gandhi really fighting for this idea as a Congress leader and Congress President
 beshak ve apane bhaashanon main prem kii baat kar rahe the lekin kya itnaa kaaphi tha
 Were he giving those questions a straightforward answer to the politics happening at that time
 kya sampradayikta ke sawaal ko lekar bahusankhyak or alpsankhyak mohallon main ja rahe the, saamne se nafrat kii raajnneeti ko chunauti de rahe the
 Who was the leader of the Congress who was struggling at the national level about the ideas of the Idea of india, or was he creating a connection with soft Hindutva
 kya yah sahi nahin he ki pichley kai chunaavon main congress kii raajnneeti alpsankhyakon se kataraa kar chalane kii ho gai thi, is dar se kii dhuvikaran na ho jaae
 Where and when the Congress was seen struggling against the politics of polarization
 jo baat is patr main he wo bijepi ke khilaaf maidani raajnneeti main kyon nahin he
 Why Rahul kept fighting alone, and why he was not taking action when other leaders of his party were leaving him alone in this battle
 is patr main likhaa he ki congress ne majbooti se or shaleenta se chunaav ladaa
 i myself personally fought against the Prime Minister, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the institutions they had occupied
 main ladaa kyonki main bharat ko pyaar karata hum
 Many times i stood completely alone and i am proud of it
 ek adhyaksh ko yah kahana pade ki vah akelaa ladata rahaa to iskaa matlab yahi he ki congress ke bheetar congress nahin bachi he
 Had she survived, she would have fought for her president
 sawaal yah bhi he ki kya unamem ladane kii kshamta or naitik bal he
 You know the answer
 kaayade se yah poocha ja saktaa he ki rahul ke patr ke is hisse ko padhane ke baad kisi congressi netaa ko shame ai bhi yaa nahin
 He further wrote that a free and fair election requires the impartiality of a country's institutions
 ek chunaav ek swatantra press, ek swatantra nyaaypalik or ek paardarshee chunaav ayog ke bagaiyr nahin ho saktaa
 Nor can an election be independent if one party has complete monopoly over financial resources
 2019 ke chunaav main hamaari ladaai ek raajnneetik dal se nahin thi
 Rather, we fought the entire government machinery, whose every institution was against the opposition
 ab yah saaf ho gaya he ki hamaari sansthaaon kii tatasthta samaapt ho chuki he
 The declared objectives of the National self-service Association that took over the institutional structure of our country have now been fulfilled
 ek vaastavik khatara yah he ki ab se chunaav bharat ke bhavishya ko tay karne ke bajaay aupchaarikta maatr rah jaaenge
 Rahul Gandhi has written that even after the victory, the corruption charges against the Prime Minister do not end
 na to paisa or na propeganda satya ko chipa saktaa he
 India must unite to restore the neutrality of its institutions
 congress iskaa ekta kaa sutaradhar banegi
 But for this, the Congress has to be completely changed
 rahul chaahate hai ki congress badale, congress chaahati he ki rahul thodaa sa or badalen
 Congress has to become Congress first
 phir adhyaksh kaa masalaa itnaa bada masalaa nahin he
 When there is a party, the leader comes out of it
 congress is vakt party nahin he
 This is my opinion
 jisase main sahamat hum
 When Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra gave a speech in the Lok Sabha, it was discussed a lot
 lekin baad main khabaren aane lageen ki unka bhaashan kahin se chori kiya gaya tha
 The gimmick began on Twitter and it was reported that Mahua Moitra stole her speech from Martin Longman's article in the Washington Monthly
 is par tivi ankaron ne kaarykram kar die
 But today Martin Longman, who wrote in the Washington Monthly, tweeted that i have become very famous in India because a politician is being wrongly accused of stealing from my article
 ye behad mazedaar baat he
 But right-wing fools are the same in every country
 koshish kii gai ki mahua mitra kaa bhaashan jo lokapriy hone laga tha uski saakh khatm kar di jaae
 Now nobody will tell you that Martin of the Washington Monthly described Mahua Moitra as immaculate
 iske baad bhi mohua ke khilaaf jari rahegaa
 This is the pattern
 udhar, vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne rajya sabha main apane likhit jawaab main kaha he ki notebandi ke baad bhrashtachar badha he
 No one has to panic because the Finance Minister did not say that he will again ban demonetisation to eradicate corruption
 aap jaanate hai ki notebandi ke peeche kuch kaaran bataae gaye the
 That the cash trend has increased, it has fake currency, it is the money of corruption
 bihar ke jhanjharpur se jadyu ke saansad ramprit mandal ne sawaal poocha tha ki notebandi ke kaaran bhrashtachar kam hua he yaa nahin
 The cash trend has increased since November 2016
 4 november 2016 kii sthiti ke anusaara noton kaa kul mulya 17,741 billian rupee tha
 21, 137 as on 29 March 2019
 64 billian rupye tha
 The Economic Review 2016-17 notes that there is a deep correlation between cash and misappropriation around the world
 transparency international ke aankalan ke anusaar chalan main nakadi jitani adhik hogi, bhrashtachar utana adhik hoga
 According to the Transparency International report the Finance Minister has mentioned, between 2017 and 2018, bribery in India increased by 11 percent
 vaise pradhanmantri ne daawa kiya tha ki bhrashtachar khatm ho gaya he
 However, it seems strange to write the Bill of Finance of the Ministry of Finance in written reply to Lok Sabha
 ajeebon garib kii jagah ajeebon amir lagata he
 Billion rupees could also be written
 kya vahaan hindi likhane vaale ko samay se selary nahin milti he
 However, in addition to English, Supreme Court decisions will come in Hindi, Assamese, Telugu, Marathi, Kannada and Odia
 mananeey adaalat se apil he ki faisle kaa anuwaad is tarah se na kiya jaae ki hindi main faisla padhane ke baad angrezi se milaanaa pade
 The objective of providing decisions in Indian languages should be that common people can read and understand them
 sarkaar ke shabdkosh kii hindi angrezi se bhi mushkil hoti he
 In Ratnagiri, Maharashtra, 12 people died as the dam broke
 darjanabhar makaan pani main bahe
 a wall of the Tiware dam broke on Tuesday night
 abhi bhi kai log laapata he
 Only last year, questions were raised about the strength of this dam
 may maheene main marammat bhi karai gai thi lekin ab isaki jaanch hogi
 The 12 people who died were due to whose negligence
 hamaare sahyogi sunil singh ne bataaya he ki haadase ke baad samaj aayaa he ki sabhi baandhon kii audit kii jaani chahie
 If this work had happened before the accident, then 12 people would not have lost their lives
 hamane is ghatana ke bare main kai media news site par jaakar dekha ki kya koi atirikt jaankaree mil sakati he
 The number of those killed have been found but no further information is available
 udhar, chennai main sookhaa alag tarah kaa sankat lekar aane laga he
 There is a report in Business Standard
 chennai se 32 mile dur ek gaanv ke logon ne ek tanker ko kabze main le liya
 They allege that the water of the village is being given to the cities
 ek gramin ne sarkaar ko patr likhaa he ki privet tanker waalon ne unke gaanv main 8 se zyaada borwell laga die hai
 Water is being transported from there to hotels in Chennai
 gaanv kaa pani kam hone laga he
 a reservoir in his village has dried up due to night and day water withdrawal
 hindu akhbaar ne likhaa he ki jaldi hi de zero aane vaala he
 The possibility of drying up of all reservoirs has deepened
 pani khatm hote hi chennai main de zero ghoshit ho jaataa he
 The idea comes from Cape Town
 jahaan pani kii rashning kii gai thi
 There will be no water in the tap
 sarkaar pani ke liye saarvajanik tay karegi or vahaan se sabko nishchit maatra main pani laana hoga
 Similarly, there is severe drought in the western part of UP
 paanch saal main june itnaa sookhaa kabhi nahin gaya
 Election reforms were debated today in the Rajya Sabha
 vipaksh ne chunaavon main paise ke istamaal or media kii bhoomika par bhi sawaal uthaae
 There was a discussion about the role of Namo TV
 chunaav ayog kii bhoomika par bhi sawaal uthe
 Many mps said that this election was one-sided in the case of donations
 tamilnadu se sipiem ke rajya sabha saansad tii ke rangarajan ne kaha ki unki parti ko karporate chanda bhi nahin dete hai
 Corporate funds should be closed in elections
 derek o bryan ne kaha ki chunaav ayukta kii niyukti kii prakriya par phir se vichaar karne kii zarurat he
 Several opposition parties had jointly demanded a debate on election reforms

 ) The social media giant Facebook is in constant controversy due to its live video feature
 hafte bhar main teen aisi ghatnaaye hui hai jisase fasebuk live video par sawaal uth rahe hai
 Although this has happened before, but recent events have put pressure on Facebook
 haal hi main 74 saal ke bujurg robert godwin ko fasebuk live par goliyon se bhun diya gaya
 Following this incident, a father of Thailand killed his 11-month-old daughter and streamed it live on Facebook
 iske baad usne aatmahatya kar lee
 Such incidents are not stopping
 After two traumatic events, once again in Alabama, the singers made a suicide video live on Facebook
 times kii report ke mutabik 49 saal ke shaks ne fasebuk live strimming karte hue bandook se khud ko uda liya
 Thousands of people watched it and shared it on Facebook before this video was removed
 isse pehle ke donon dardanaak videos unke fasebuk profile par lagbhag 24 ghante tak rahe
 Not only this, it has been viewed 4 lakh times
 iske pehle bhi fasebuk live video ke galat yuj kii khabare aati rahi hai
 The gang rape video was also streamed live earlier this year in Sweden where the gang rape video was broadcast via Facebook Live
 gauratlab he ki fasebuk live kisi bhi yujar ko apane smartphone se diarect video broadcast karne kaa opshan detaa he
 Jacqueline Helfgott, head of the Criminal Justice Department at Seattle University, believes that the problem is gradually deepening
 soshal media criminals ko unke ghinaune kaamon ko failaane kaa kaam kar rahaa he or isaki pahuch zyada se zyada logon tak ho rahi he
 Sarah T
 Roberts of the University of California, who specializes in commercial content moderation, told The Guardian, 'if Facebook can't rein in this, i don't think new tools will solve the problem', Robert continued
 These are moments after which most social critics, journalists and policy makers are constantly trying to get the company's CEO Mark Zuckerberg to live the murder and such incidents Address and take some strong steps on it
 lekin philhal aisa nahin dikh rahaa he’haalanki pichley samay se fasebuk ne live videos se woilence vaale content hataane ke liye kai maanak tay kiye hai
 There is also a preparation for this from new algorithms to cantilever filtering, but so far Facebook seems to be unable to remove such videos immediately
 fasebuk ne aise videos ko jald hataane ke liye artificial intelligence kaa sahaara legaa
 Facebook was expected to announce it officially in its developer conference F8, but it did not
 murder or rape ke alaava fasebuk par bal shoshan kitasviren or darjanon aise videos jisamen woilensavaale content ko duusare tareeke se failaayaa ja rahaa he
 According to a report published in the Times recently, Facebook may be prosecuted in the UK for failing to remove pictures of child abuse
 fasebuk ne pehle live videos kaa feechar sirf celibrities ke liye hi rakhaa tha
 But it became popular and now it is available for everyone
 yah fasebuk ke sabase behtareen or atyaadhunik feechar main se ek mana gaya, lekin ab yahi feechar company ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab ban rahaa he
 It has to be seen how the company overcomes it
 kya phir se ise sirf kuch logon ke liye limit kiya jayega yaa phir artificial intelligence es content ko tatkaal roak paaenge? In Ayodhya, the city of Lord Rama, a new matter is in discussion all these days
 morari baapu kii ramakatha sunne ke liye mumbai se kareeb 200 sex varkar ayodhya main pahunchi hui hai jisaki vajah se ek jamaat naakhush he or is dharmik nagari main unki maujuudagi par sawaal uthaa rahaa he
 a Shiv Sena leader says that this time we are allowing him to do Katha, but he will not be allowed to do Katha in Ayodhya any further, there will be heavy opposition on the streets
 darasal, mashhoor ramakatha vaachak morari baapu ne is baar ayodhya main ho rahi apni katha kaa theme hi 'ganika' rakhaa he
 Ganika means 'city-bride'
 ganika badnaam galiyon kii nartakiyaan yaa phir aam bhashaa main inhen sex workars kaha jaataa he
 Ramkatha is being organized on this theme for the first time and that too in Ayodhya
 morari baapu ne pehali baar apni ramakatha main ganikaon kaa prasang liya he or ramcharitamanas, ramayana ke saath-saath duusare granthon ke prasangon kaa hawala dekar ganikaon ke saath samaaj ke sambandh or samaaj ke tiraskaar ko bhi vyakt kiya he
 These women, who came with an NGO from Mumbai, come and sit in Morari Bapu's Ram Katha every day, but some people from Ayodhya are questioning the introduction of sex workers in Morari Bapu's story
 sthaneey jyotishacharya pandit praveen sharma ne kaha, 'ganikaon ko ayodhya main ekatra kiye jane kaa main virodh karuunga
 It is not good to organize kitsch and money
 ladakiyon ko agar sudhaarna hi tha to unke liye paise jutakar unhen de dete
 It would have been fine if she had come voluntarily
 aap aamantrit karke laae yah galat baat he
 The people of Ayodhya were not familiar with sex workers
 morari baapu ne ayodhya ke vaataavaran ko pradooshit kiya he
 'won't come next time: Shiv Sena leader Santosh Dubey expressed disappointment when Shiv Sena women were taken aback,' i am also opposing the girls and sex workers
 ramcharita maanas main kahin bhi iskaa zikr nahin he
 i have read the entire Ramayana and there is no mention of ganis anywhere
 mujhe lagata he ki morari baapu bhatak gaye hai
 The work you were doing was good work, it is not good work
 sex varkar shabd ko kabhi sweekaaryata nahin mil paaegi
 Now all the workers understand but the sex worker does not understand
 'unhone aage kaha ki agar aapako sudhaarna he to jaakar kar mumbai main sudhaariye, aapako sudhaarna he to naksaliyon ko sudhaaren jo logon kii jaan le rahe hai
 You should reform Pakistan-based terrorists
 ladakiyon ko sudhaarney ke liye ayodhya koun si jagah he
 Ayodhya saints are sitting silently because of Dakshina and no one is saying anything
 mujhe lagata he ki morari babu par umr kaa asar aa gaya
 This time, we are allowing them to narrate, but they will not be allowed to narrate in Ayodhya any further, there will be heavy opposition on the streets
 duusari ore, lagaataar virodh ke baavjood morari baapu apni katha main lagaataar in sex workars kaa zikr kar rahe hai
 Through his narrative, he is putting the situation in front of the society and forcing the society to think for the welfare of sex workers
 ramajnmabhumi ke pujari satyendra das ne kaha, 'ayodhya main ek taraf kuch log virodh main hai to zyaadaatar sadhu-sant morari baapu kii ramakatha main ganikaon ko bulaae jane ke samarthan main hai
 All the big saints of Ayodhya, all are with Morari Bapu's step and are supporting him
 'saraahneey kadamah swami paramhansasex workars ke bulaae jane kaa samarthan karte hueswami paramhansakahate hai ki virodh karne vaale do tarah ke log hai yaa to jinako shastron kaa gyaan nahin he yaa phir jinhen tavajjo nahin mil rahaa
 The action Morari Bapu has taken is very commendable and those who are commenting do not know our history and spirituality
 dattatreya bhagwaan ke 24veen guru bhi ek guru ganika thim
 We also have its tradition here
 ganikaon ko ramakatha main laana bahut saraahneey kadam he or sabhi log iskaa swaagat karte hai or sabhi ko uskaa swaagat karnaa chahie
 The opposer is malleable
 agar ramakatha sunne se kisi kaa charitra acha hota he to vah bilkul hona chahie or yahaan jitani ganikaayen ai hai unka swaagat he
 However, the common people of Ayodhya considered the move to be commendable and agree with Morari Bapu's decision to specifically call him
 unke hisaab se yah samaaj sudhaar kaa ek bahut hi acha kadam he or chaahe kitna bhi virodh ho isse peeche nahin hatana chahie

 ’fronteer post samachar patr ne aaj tarik ke hawaale se kaha ki suraksha balon or shanti samitiyon ke saath kaam kar rahe sabhi logon ko taliban adaalat main pesh kiya jaayegaa or islamic kanoon yaa sharia ke mutabik dand diya jaayegaa
 Tariq admitted that 23 Mehsud community residents of South Waziristan are in the custody of the Taliban

 Their stubbornness in not telling the reason why they remained silent for almost a decade is doing something wrong among themselves

 lahoti kii unhone jo ninda kii he vah duraagrahpurn he
 Nevertheless, his allegations cannot be ignored
 ek angreji dainik main unke khulaase bataate hai ki mukhya nyaayadhish lahoti ne pradhanmantri kii chintaaon ko jaanakar apana iraadaa badal diya
 Now if it is said that he did this in honor of the Prime Minister, it would be difficult to accept
 sansthaaon ko milakar kaam karnaa chahie or jahaan tak sambhav ho, sahmati banaakar chalanaa chahie
 Supremacy should be the last tool
 yah nahin ki use jab-tab jebi churi kii tarah laharaa diya jaae
 When his collegium turned down the proposal to reinstate a judge, in such a situation whether Lahoti should have sensitized institutions, this question may now be the way to evaluate his previous behavior
 pradhanmantri desh ke mukhya nyaayadhish se koi aagrah kar saktaa he yaa nahin, iskaa auchity jaanchana hamaare jaise tuchh logon kaa kaam nahin he
 Their behavior can be questioned either by the Parliament or the anchors of the TV channels! The High Court and the judges of the Supreme Court have such huge powers, the real issue is that there is scope to appoint someone other than the best on these posts
 Is not made
 phir bhi, agar yah vyavastha kisi sandigdh (chaahe sahi ho yaa galat) ko nyaayadhish bane rahane kii chhot detii he, to is par gambhirtha se punarvichaar karne kii jarurat he
 Here the English proverb must be remembered that "the king's wife should be beyond all doubt
" ” iske alaava, aisi vyavastha jisamen mukhya nyaayadhish ke pad par vivaad khadaa kiya ja sake jaisaa ki aaj ho rahaa he, use beshak badal diya janaa chahie
 The appointment of a judge requires that a person who is a pundit of law, whose life is almost like a saint, a character like a saint and a student of law with curiosity and humility
 vakeelon main se supreme court or hycourt ke jajon kii niyukti main unki kanoonee pratibha or charitra kaa moolyankan jaruri hota he
 The legal talent of lawyers can be judged in the courts but they do not have the methods to gather information about their character
 isi vajah se pratyaashiyon kii gopneey report khufia beuro (ibi) se taiyaar karai jaati rahi he
 The role of the government has now been limited to sending the IB report to the collegium
 shaayad karypalika ko is prakriya se puri tarah se baahar kar dene kaa hi nateeja he ki aisi apaatr niyuktiyaan bhi un logon ke jariye ho jaati hai jo puri tarah bakhbar nahin hote
 After all, who should decide about the appointment of judges? Whether the judiciary itself, the executive should do it jointly or else, should the matter of appointment be with an independent organization? It is written in the constitution that the President should appoint the President (ie Executive) on the advice of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and (in the case of High Court Judges) the Chief Justice of the High Court
 sankalchand seth maamle main (jab immergency ke kaale daur main ek pratishthit jaj kaa sthanantaran abujh vajahon se kar diya gaya tha) supreme court ne jajon kii niyukti or sthanantaran ke maamle main karypalika kii sarvocchata ko jaij tehraaya tha
 That opinion
 pi
 It was also repeated during the decision of the Gupta case, which is called the Judges' case
 supreme court ne jab badali prakriyabad ke varshon main karypalika ke badhate hath or duraagrah ke chalate supreme court nyaaypalika main niyuktiyon se sambandhit kanoon kii vyakhya nae sire se karne ko majaboor ho gaya or usne aisi vyakhya kii jisase mukhya nyaayadhish ko sarvocchata hasil ho gai
 According to him, the collegium of the judges of the Supreme Court will make recommendations, the government will give its views and if it objected to the proposed appointment, then the collegium will consider it and take the final decision
 yadi collegium ne aapatti ko thukraa diya, tab sarkaar ke paas prastaavit vyakti ko jaj niyukt karne ke alaava or koi vikalp nahin hoga
 In the present case, it has happened in practice that the Chief Justice changed the opinion of his collegium at the request of the Prime Minister's Office
 pichley ek dashak main collegium vaali vyavastha kii aalochanaayen hui hai
 Late Judge J
 es
 Verma had sharply criticized it in an interview to Karan Thapar
 supreme court ne 1993 main jajon kii niyukti kii prakriya ko karypalika se hataakar nyaayadhishon par kendrit karne ke apane faisle or is tarah sanvaidhanik praavdhaan kii vyakhya main amulchul parivartan karne ke bachaav main kaha tha ki samvidhan ek jeevant dastavej he or uski vyakhya aisi honi chahie jo swatantra nyaaypalika ko sunishchit karne ke vyapak uddeshy kaa hit saadh sake
 There is no problem in this proposition that in constitutional democracy, the judiciary should be free from political pressures
 sawaal he ki ise kaise hasil kiya jaae
 Despite the executive supremacy from 1950 to 1993, some of the best judges have raised the value of our courts

 Krishna Iyer was appointed by the executive
 iske bainks maujuuda vyavastha aise jajon kii niyukti ko roak paane main asamarth rahi he jinke paas ek nyaayadhish kaa buniyadi charitra tak nahin tha, or jinamein se kuch to, lord atkin ke shabdon main kahen to, karypalika se zyada karypalika vaali maansikta ke the
 It can be said that both the systems have their flaws
 niyuktiyon kii padtaal kaa samaymaujuuda vivaad is jarurat ko rekhaankit karata he ki jajon kii niyukti kii vyavastha par punarvichaar hona chahie
 There are many models that can be considered for this
 bharat kaa anubhav dikhaata he ki karypalika kii sarvocchata ham bharatiyon ke liye upyukt nahin he
 Judicial supremacy has proved equally flawed
 hamen ek sthaayee sanstha chahie (lok seva ayog jaisaa kuch) jo pratyaashiyon ke naam chhaant kar ek suchi banaae or us suchi se chayan karne ke liye ek aisi ucchadhikaar praapt samiti ho jisamen nyaayadhish, rajnatik pratinidhi or desh ke kuchhek ati pratishthit log hon
 a permanent institution should have a system by which it can sort out the best
 uske paas aisi pranali honi chahie jisase vah pratyaashiyon ke charitra or unki prishthbhumi kii jaankaree juta sake or aise peshewar log hone chahie jo pratyaashee ke vyaktitv kii sateekta kii jaanch kar saken
 Secondly, the tenure of judges cannot be reduced in any way, although the institutional system should have the authority to investigate the allegations against them and if they are found to be inappropriate, they can be dropped
 kaanaafu si or media main khabaron ko li karne ke maujuuda tareekon ne nyaay tantra kii eemaandaaree main aam logon ke bharose ko diga diya he
 At the same time, the executive cannot be given such rights that he can run his stick on the judges
 mahabhiyog kii sanvaidhanik pranali naakaam ho chuki he
 Transferring the suspected judge from one court to another is like sending the problem from one court to another
 ek or suzav he jis par bahes kii ja sakati he—kya jajon kii gunvattta kaa samay-samay par moolyankan kiya jaae taaki avaanchit tatwon ko hataaya ja sake? iske alaava, jajon ke paas bhi ek forum hona chahie jahaan ve apni shikaayatein darj karvaa saken, jiske liye kanoon mantri ke paas bhagkar jane kii jarurat na ho
 The judiciary can neither control the magnate, nor does it have any muscle
 phir bhi uske shabdon or nirdeshon kaa taqatvar se taqatvar sarkarein sammaan karti hai to isliye kyonki use janamat ke vishaal sagar se takat hasil hoti he
 In Pakistan, President Pervez Musharraf had to pay a good price for molesting the judiciary
 bharat main koi bhi sarkaar kabhi bhi supreme court kii avmaananaa kii himakat nahin karegi
 The only condition is that the public perception of the judiciary should remain strong
 yadi use itnaa nuksaan pahunchaaya gaya jise sudhaarna mushkil ho, to iskaa matlab adaalaton kii vaidhata kaa ant or unka ikbaal khatm ho jayega
 Then the end of Indian democracy also will not be far away

 log in bhale hi pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bharat ratna or purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke janmdiwas par unke naam par 100 rupye kaa sikaa jari kar unhen amar karne kaa prayaas kiya ho, lekin hakeekat main logon ke jehan main vaajapeyi kii yaad ko avismaraneey banane ke liye jameen par jo kiya janaa chahie wo nahin ho sakaa
 Vajpayee's ancestral village Bateshwar is still waiting for the proposed monument
 darasal uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke paitruk gaanv vateshwar ko 'adarsh gaanv' banane kaa vaada kiya tha
 Along with this, he also promised to build a grand memorial in his memory at Bateshwar village at the conclusion of Vajpayee's 'asthi Visarjan Yatra' but Vajpayee's village is still waiting for the fulfillment of Yogi's promise
 gauratlab he ki purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke nidhan ke uparant unki asthiyon ko desh bhar main pravaahit karne ke liye bijepi ke tamaam mukhyamantriyon ne apane apane rajya main 'asthi visarjan yatra' nikaali thi
 In this sequence, different Chief Ministers made various announcements in the memory of Vajpayee in their state
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ke paitrik gaanv bateshwar ke rahane vaale bhagwaan singh kaa kahana he ki mukhyamantri ne teen maheene pehle kai vaade kiye the, lekin is disha main kuch bhi nahin ho paaya, yahaan tak bateshwar tak aane vaali sadaken bhi jarjar avasthaa main hai
 Neither Bateshwar nor Bah tehsil got anything in the name of development
 vypeyi kaa paitrik awaas khandhar main tabdeel ho chukaa he or tuuti deevaaron main babul ke ped ug aae hai
 The promise of the Chief Minister also seems to have been immersed in the Yamuna with Vajpayee's ashes
 congress netaa shabbir abbaas ne kaha ki atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa sammaan har raajnneetik dalon ke netaa karte hai
 It is sad to see Vajpayee's death turned into a media circus for political gain
 piem modi ke jumale kii tarah 25 karod rupee kii laagat se bateshwar kaa vikaas bhi bijepi kaa jumala banakar rah gaya
 But people understand this lie and the people will surely punish the BJP for making people feel stupid
 manoj vaajapeyi kii film ‘satya’ ko 20 saal puure ho gaye hai
 Sathya was released on July 3, 1998
 is film main manoj kaa nibhaayaa gaya kirdaar bhikhu mhatre bollywood ke ikonic role main se ek mana jaataa he
 But the most interesting thing is that when Manoj was offered this role, he refused to do it
 haal hi main die ek intervyuu main manoj ne is film se kai dilachasp kisse sunaae
 Manoj Vajpayee, the actor's refusal to play Bhikhu Mhatre's role, made him very famous with his performance
 lekin jab unhen is bhoomika kaa prastaav diya gaya tha tab vah khush nahin the kyonki unki ichha tital role nibhaane kii thi
 The film revamped the careers of writers Anurag Kashyap and Vajpayee
 kashyap ne abhinayta saurabh shukla ke saath mil kar film kii patakatha likhi thi
 Manoj Bajpayee said, "initially there was an agreement that i would play the title role but he said that he is looking for the actor not for the title role but for a strong presence
" mujhe sahi kirdaar mila iske liye main ab ishwar kaa shukriya adaa karata hum
 'how Bane Bhikhu Mhatre's character was written by historian Manoj Vajpayee in this film, King Kaun of Mumbai, Bhikhu

 Fans have not forgotten this dialogue even today
 manoj vaajapeyi ne bataaya ki bhikhu ke bolne kaa tarika maine apane bawarchi se siikhaa tha
 My cook was a resident of Kolhapur
 jab satya film ko bataaya gaya tha sabase badi galatimanoj vaajapeyi ne bataaya ki film satya kii relies ke hafte bhar ke bheetar film ko sabase badi galati qaraar diya gaya kyonki ise dekhne keval 15-20 log hi aae
 But suddenly the viewership started increasing and many such cinema halls, which had dropped the film, resumed its performance

 Although there is no official holiday, but still those who have boyfriends take a little time to celebrate this day
 aapako bataa den ki boyfriend de (boyfriend Day) kii tarah garlfriend de (girlfriend Day) bhi hota he jise har saal 1 agast ko manaaya jaataa he
 By the way, Valentine's Day is celebrated with great fanfare across the world on February 14
 haalanki boyfriend de ko lekar koi pusht soochna nahin he isliye aisa mana jaataa he ki ho saktaa he ki kuch logon ko laga ho ki garlfriend de kii tarah boyfriend de bhi manaaya janaa chahie
 Perhaps this is why it started celebrating boyfriend's day
 aapako bataa den ki 1 agast ko har saal garlfriend de manaaya jaataa he
 In fact, Girlfriend Day began during the promotion of the book Girlfriends Gateway by authors Kathleen Lang and Elizabeth Butterfield

 There will also be a corporation to make it
 us karporation kaa naam he rashtrawaad

 go raksha to kabhi rashtrawaad
 Now it needs a grocery store to sell it and also a super mall, named Media
 jab vah toothpaste kaa brands alag-alag launch kar saktaa he to media kaa bhi launch kar saktaa he
 There is only one boss, but his channels are many
 ab ho yah rahaa he ki madia kii dukaan main sampradayikta bechney ke liye rashtrawaad kaa cover chadhaaya ja rahaa he

 Do you ever wonder why the media is becoming so fierce about nationalism? Why is this nationalism raised every time in the name of army and border? Why does cow protection come when it gets cold? Nationalism comes when cow gets beaten? You may consider this fight as a matter between a few anchors, but it is not so

 kya dilli main vaisaa shauchalay or bhi kahin rakhaa gaya? aisa he to do saal main dilli main kam se kam sau pachaas aise shauchalay to rakhe hi gaye honge? kya aapako dikhte hai? kya aapako dilli ke mohallon main yaa apane kisi shahar main aise shochaalay, koodaydaan dikhte hai jo is abhiyaan ke tahat rakhe gaye hon? unki saaf safai hoti he? ek yaa do koodaydaan rakh khanaapurti kii baat nahin kar rahaa
 Even if it will succeed, it is due to the correctness of all these systems and not the nationalism of the abusive goons who are on Twitter

 Mehbooba Mufti even took the credit of a great success from the army that she killed unknowingly
 ab to sena kii shaan main bhi gustaakhee ho gai
 Should Mehbooba Mufti be arrested and prosecuted for treason? Will anchor people also demand this? With what rights are you talking about running a case of treason against journalists? The government that they are jumping on, will that government do so that Mehbooba will be sacked? Will any of that government get this statement back from Mehbooba? isliye raajnneeti ko raajnneeti kii tarah dekhie
 If nationalism is used in this, then one day these leaders will also make the condition of nationalism like service to the country

 This is communalism in the name of nationalism, which you do not want to see
 sampradayikta kaa nayaa naam he rashtrawaad
 There is a need to protect nationalism from communalism and to watch less TV
 is daur main sampradayikta alag-alag brands rup main aa rahi he
 Love, Jihad, fear of population, cow meat, calling religious flags as Pakistani, migration, cow protection
 ye sab us brands ke alag-alag varjan hai
 Like there may be different brands of toothpaste
 patanjali, kolgate, miswak, pepsodent toothpaste hai sampradayikta
 There will also be a corporation to make it
 us karporation kaa naam he rashtrawaad
 It is selling the same toothpaste under different names
 go raksha to kabhi rashtrawaad
 Now it needs a grocery store and a super mall to name it, the media
 jab vah toothpaste kaa brands alag-alag launch kar saktaa he to media kaa bhi launch kar saktaa he
 There is only one boss, but his channels are many
 ab ho yah rahaa he ki madia kii dukaan main sampradayikta bechney ke liye rashtrawaad kaa cover chadhaaya ja rahaa he
 There are so many toothpastes, which one will buy, which is also a treatment

 Do you ever wonder why the media is becoming so fierce about nationalism? Why is this nationalism raised every time in the name of army and border? Why does cow protection come when it gets cold? Nationalism comes when cow gets beaten? You may consider this fight as a matter between a few anchors, but it is not so

 There is a need to protect nationalism from communalism and to watch less TV

 When it can launch a brand of toothpaste separately, it can also launch media
 vahaan bhi aakaa ek hi he magar unke channel kai hai
 Now it is happening that the cover of nationalism is being offered to sell communalism in the media shop

 Someone who is playing this game
 koi he jisaki raajnneetik mahatvakanksha ke liye yah khel khelaa ja rahaa he uskaa cheharaa aap kabhi nahin dekh paaenge kyonki mahakarporation kiske ishaare par chalata he, uskaa cheharaa koi nahin dekh paata he
 Only people are counted and dead bodies are buried
 puri duniya main aisa hi chalan he
 Nationalism which is full ie those who have a paste in their tube, what have they done? One of its biggest campaigns was launched, which is still in launch stage
 svachh bharat abhiyaan
 Two years ago, many politicians, activists and actors used to tweet a lot with a broom
 twitor par nau ratna niyukt karte the ki ye bhi safai karenge tabhi desh saaf hoga
 It was said that nothing will happen to the government alone
 sabko aage aana hoga
 Where are those people today? Where are the 9 gems of Twitter? Where is the cleanliness drive? Where is the nationalistic feeling that these people were spraying the charanamrit that now we are going to be clean and tidy
 jo log aae the unka rashtrawaad kyon thanda pad gaya? do saal main to wo apni puri colony saaf kar dete
 Did they stop looking at the anchors who have been given the task of collecting toll tax of nationalism? svachh bharat abhiyaan ke tahat nai dilli ke balmiki mandir ke paas anokhaa shauchalay bana
 Did that toilet be kept somewhere else in Delhi? If this is so, at least one hundred fifty such toilets must have been kept in Delhi in two years? Do you see Do you see such trash, dustbins in the mohallas of Delhi or in any of your cities that have been kept under this campaign? Are they clean? Keeping one or two dustbins is not talking about Khanapurti
 agar kahin ye safal bhi hoga to inhen sab vyavasthaaon ke durust hone kii vajah se na ki twitor par chaaye gaali gundon ke rashtrawaad se
 The meaning of this story is that nationalism is not the cause of your problem
 swatchta abhiyaan isliye fel hua kyonki dilli ko saaf karne ke liye kai hajaar safai karmchaaree kii zarurat thi
 What got admitted? There are reports of non-payment of salaries of the existing employees
 unhone apni selary ke liye dilli kii sadakon par kachra tak phenk diya
 Now you should not ask such questions, so your arrangement has been made
 lagaataar aise mudde pesh kiye ja rahe hai jinka sambandh kabhi sidhe sampradayikta se ho yaa rashtrawaad se
 This is happening because you always started living in a fictional world, you live it anyway
 koi he jo aapako koob samaj rahaa he
 That you are busy on a smart phone
 inhen smart phone par ek game aa gaya he
 Pokémon
 khelte-khelte isi bahaane apane mohalle main swatchta khoj aaiega
 Why does our soldier get eighteen thousand monthly? Should the salary of a lawmaker be more than that of a soldier? At least the soldiers are not accused of looting the country standing on the border
 ve to jaan de dete hai
 How many of the legislators' mps have gone to jail and how many more can go, but they form and run governments
 inke apaar fund kii gangotri kidar he? rashtrawaad kii chintaa kerani he to yah bolo ki seemaa se chuttee par lautne vaala jawan general bogi yaa second class main ladaa kar kyon jaataa he? uske liye asi train kyon nahin book hoti? uskaa baccha aise skool main kyon padhata jiskaa master janaganana karne gaya he
 Why is his salary not fifty thousand? aap jo tivi par ankaron ke marfat us agyaat vyakti kii mahatvakanksha ke liye rache ja rahe tamaashe ko patrakarita samaj rahe hai wo darasal kuch or hai
 You are being dragged daily in your name in the name of nationalism so that you do not question its name
 daal kii keemat par baat na karen yaa mahangi fees kii charchaa na karen
 That is why nationalism camps are being created in the media
 ankar sarkaar se kah rahaa he ki wo patrakaron par deshadroh kaa muqadama chalaae
 The day the journalist turned to the government, understand that the government has turned against the public
 patrkaar jab patrakaron par nishaanaa saadhane lagen to wo kisi bhi sarkaar ke liye svarnim pal hota he
 Basic questions stop arising
 jab bhavishya nidhi fund ke maamle main channelon ne garib mazaduron kaa saath nahin diya to wo bengalooru kii sadakon par hazaron kii sankhya main nikal ain
 The textile workers repaired the government
 isliye log dekh samaj rahe hai
 In the case of JNU, these people were diverting the attention of the people under the guise of nationalism
 fel ho gaye
 Now it has been relaunched on the pretext of Kashmir! mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ne kaha he ki burhan vaani ko chhod diya jaataa agar sena ko pataa hota ki vah burhan he
 Mehbooba, a BJP ally, did not even call Burhan a terrorist and if she is, then why does she not talk about killing him as nationalists do
 mahabuuba mufti ne to sena se ek badi kamyaabi kaa shrey bhi le liya ki usne anjaane main maar diya
 Now even the pride of the army has become cocky
 kya mahabuuba mufti ko giraftaar kar deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chalaaya jaae? kya ankar log ye bhi maang karenge? kis haq se patrakaron ke khilaaf deshadroh kaa muqadama chalaane kii baat kar rahe hai? jis sarkaar ke dam par wo kud rahe hai kya wo sarkaar aisa karegi ki mahabuuba ko barkhaast kar degi? kya us sarkaar kaa koi bada mahabuuba se yah bayaan waapas karvaa legaa?tippaniyan Therefore, look at politics as politics
 isamen agar rashtrawaad kaa istamaal hoga to ek din rashtrawaad kii haalat bhi ye netaa desh seva jaisi kar denge
 Whenever they bring the name of Desh Seva to the tongue, it seems that they are lying
 ham sab rashtravaadi hai
 To know this, if you come to watch TV at 9 o'clock every night, then you have itching, not nationalism
 neem hakim jisaki dawa zaalim loshan bataate hai
 i give you a free advice
 channelon ke liye aapkaa cabel par har maheene teen se paanch sau rupaya kharch hota hoga
 When you have to take a pill of hate between Hindus and Muslims under the guise of nationalism by paying five hundred rupees, then you cut the cable
 jab aapane nafrat thaan hi lee he to kijiye nafrat
 Why are five hundred cable and five hundred junk newspapers giving for this? Save your one thousand! to aap se guzarish he ki raajnneeti or rashtrawaad main fark kijiye
 This is not the nationalism you are understanding
 yah rashtrawaad ke naam par sampradayikta he, jo aap dekhnaa hi nahin chaahate
 Nationalism is the new name of communalism
 zarurat he rashtrawaad ko sampradayikta se bachaane kii or tivi kam dekhne kii
 Do you ever wonder why the media is becoming so fierce about nationalism? Why is this nationalism raised every time in the name of army and border? Why does cow protection come when it gets cold?

 He had already taken three-four people with him
 ’iske baad thalsena or police ne skool ke aasapaas ke ilaake kii gheraabandi kar lee, taaki bandhakon ko chhudaaya ja sake
 Another hostage Vikramjit said, 'we were taken to school on the strength of a gun
 usne hamase ilaake se bhaagane kaa rasta dikhaane ko kaha
 Vikramjit said that the terrorist threatened him that if he did not show him the way, he would kill his family
 unhone kaha ki use kuch khaane kii bhi peshkash kii gai
 While Deshraj, Subhash Sharma and Jeevan managed to escape, Vikramjit and Rakesh confronted the terrorists and captured them after much struggle
 vikramjit ne kaha, ‘maine uski gardan pakadi or usne (rakesh ne) uski bandook pakad l
 He (the terrorist) fired some bullets, but we narrowly escaped and caught him
 ’upayukta ne bataaya ki kismat se ames kii maang ko lekar chal rahi hadtaal ke kaaran skool main koi chaatr nahin tha
 He said a large quantity of arms and ammunition were recovered from the terrorist
 input: bhashaa On the claim made on the roads, the BMC again surrounded the BMC on social media, people saw the reality Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) got trapped in its lie again
 kuch din pehle hi biemasi standing cameti ke chairman yashavanth jadhav ne india today se baat karte hue daawa kiya tha ki mumbai main ek bhi gaddha nahin he
 After this, Shiv Sena leader Jadhav was trolled on social media
 saath hi soshal media par mumbai kii sadakon ke pole kholte gaddhon kii tasveeron or video kii baadh aa gai
 The BMC has launched another mobile app following criticism around where citizens can register issues related to pits
 biemasi ne twit main kaha he, ‘mumbai, hamane mumbai ke gaddhon kii dikkaton ke liye pukhta samaadhaan dhundha he
 Wherever the pit looks, report it to the new mybmc @mybmc Pothole Fixit app

 iske alaava isi kaam ke liye helpline number bhi he
 In such a situation, people and opposition have not shown any special enthusiasm on the new step taken by BMC
 biemasi main netaa vipaksh ravi raja ne twit kiya he, ‘biemasi gaddhon kii samasya ke liye ek or ap lekar aayaa he
 i do not understand when the monsoon is about to end, the citizens have suffered a lot and above all we have a helpline
 is ap se kya antar aayega? or agar aap standing cameti ke pramukh or prashasan tak ke daawey ko yaad karen to kaha gaya tha ki shahar main koi gaddha nahin he

(continued in thread)— Ravi Raja INC (@ravirajainc)september 20, 2019artiai activist shakeel ahamed bhi biemasi kii ore se nae ap ko launch kiye jane se hairaan hai
 Shakeel Ahmad had opened this argument through RTI about how BMC spent 17 thousand rupees to fix the only pit, that too with inferior material
 shakeel kehete hai, ‘system pehle se hi he
 There is no need to add anything to that
 ejiniyaron ko jo karne kii zarurat he wo he ki sabhi kaam eemaandaaree se karnaa sunishchit kiya jaae
 It is beyond my understanding when so many platforms already exist, why did BMC need another app? It is like sprinkling salt on the wounds of the common man

 sainya balon ne javaabi karrwai main sabhi chaar aatankiyon ko maar giraaya
 In recent years, it is said to be the biggest attack on military forces
 suraksha sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik, uri hamale main seemaa paar baithe aatankiyon ke aakaaon ne teen badi yojanaayen banaai thim, iske tahat hi sena ke camp par fidaayin hamalaa kiya gaya
 The first plan was to shoot as many soldiers as possible while firing unarmed and sleeping soldiers
 iske baad batalian headquarts ke prashasnic block main medical aid unit main ghuskar vahaan khoonkhraba karnaa or iske baad ant main officers mess main ghuskar khud ko uda lenaa
 However, because of the decision to introduce para-special forces into the administrative block, the terrorists could not succeed in their nefarious plans
 special forces ne aatankwaadiyon ko prashasnic block main hi simit kar diya or tezi se kiye oparation main khatm kar diya
 All four terrorists were killed within a few hours
 vaise isse pehle hi nihathe sainikon par golibari se kaaphi nuksaan ho chukaa tha
 The militants opened fire at the battalion headquarters at the fuel depot by throwing a number of grenades
 isse lagbhag sau meter ke daayre main bheeshan aag lag gai, jisamen adhiktar sainikon kii jaan gai
 The comments udhar, khufia sutron ko yah ashanka jataa rahe hai ki uri par hua aatanki hamalaa jaish-e-mohammad ke afjal guru squad ne kiya he
 The special thing is that it is the terrorist squad, which is also responsible for the Pathankot attack
 khufia agenciyon ko ashanka thi ki pathankot hamale ke naakaamayaab hone ke baad masood ajahar khud ko sabit karne ke liye koi bada aatanki hamalaa karegaa
 Markets written in Pashtun language have also been found in the maps recovered from the terrorists
 isaki jaanch agency kar rahi he

 This led to a fierce fire within a radius of about 100 meters, killing most of the soldiers
 tippaniyan On the other hand, intelligence sources are fearing that the terrorist attack on Uri has been carried out by Afzal Guru Squad of jaish-e-mohammed
 khaas baat yah he ki yahi aatanki squad he, jo pathankot hamale ke liye bhi zimmedaar he
 Intelligence agencies feared that after the Pathankot attack failed, Masood Azhar would launch a major terrorist attack to prove himself
 aatankwaadiyon ke paas se baraamad nakshon main pashtun bhashaa main likhi markings bhi mili hai

 noida main dindahaade kaatilon nesoftware ejiniyakankit chouhan kii hatya kar di, lekin din ke ujaale main bheed bhare raste par bhala koi sirf kisi car ko peechha karte dekh ye kaise jaan saktaa he ki wo uski jaan lene aayaa he?ankit chauhanan goli lagane se pehle apane bhajite naresh ko phone par kaha tha, 'bhai koi meraa peechha kar rahaa he
 He will kill me mujhe bachaa lo bhai'
 Now this last line has become the biggest mystery of Ismardar
 is line main itane sawaal chupe hai ki agar unke jawaab mil gaye, to ankit ke kaatil kaa cheharaa benakaab ho jayega
 Ankit had a holiday on the day of the accident and had gone out of the house to have his wife's office lunch with a friend
 aakhir kaatil ko kaise pataa chalaa ki wo kitne baje kidar jane ke liye ghar se nikalegaa? aise anginat sawaal hai jo bataate hai ki noida casoftware ejiniyakankit chouhan kaa kaatil jo bhi he
 
 wo he kareebi
 The fear of killing Ankit as soon as he realizes his chase proves that he already had enmity with someone or someone had threatened to kill him
 aakhir usee car main savaar dost gagan ko ankit ne apane kaatil yaa dushmano ke bare main kyon nahin bataaya? or agar bataaya to kya gagan jhooth bol rahaa he?darasal 15 kilometre se kaatil ankit kaa peechha kar rahe the
 Ankit was also telling everything to his nephew Naresh on the phone, so wouldn't he have once told Gagan sitting on an equal seat, who are the people to chase after all? And it is also a matter of thinking that if the pursuers had come to take their lives, then Gagan should have been in danger of life
 car beshak ankit chalaa rahaa tha
 But his friend Gagan was also sitting with him
 sawaal ye bhi he ki agar ankit kaa koi dushman nahin tha aushankit ko apane dushmanonko bare main kuch pataa bhi nahin tha to usne ye kaise maan liya ki peechha karne vaale usee kii jaan ke peeche pade hai
 It is difficult to be so that during the chase of the murderer, Ankit has not told anything about the attackers with Gagan till he was shot all the way
 ankit kii car ko overtek karne ke baad bich sadak par jis tarah kaatilon negoliyaan chalaayinusase ek baat to tay he ki kaatil anaadi nahin the, balki ho saktaa ki unhen katl kii supaari di gai ho
 Because when the killer got out of the car and shot Ankit, his face was not covered
 lekin phir bhi ankit yaa uske dost gagan ne use nahin pahachaanaa
 Ankit leaving the house, going to Amisha for lunch, only Ankit, Amisha and Gagan knew this
 police kii maane to lunch ke liye amisha ke daftar jane kaa program khud ankit ne banaaya tha
 Ankit's father has alleged that his relationship with Ankit's cousin was not good, but what was the enmity, this is the secret at the moment
 haalanki police ko pataa chalaa he ki ankit ke khandaan main bahut puraani dushmani kii kahani he
 The police is trying to find out if any such failed lover is not behind this murder, who is angry with Amisha's marriage
 kyonki shaadi ko sirf ek maheenaa hi hua tha
 Now whatever is true, but two things are bothering the police the most
 ek yah ki ankit to jaanata tha ki koi use maarane ja rahaa he, lekin kya ankit ke tamaam kareebi uske dushman se anjaan rahe?duusari cheez ye ki ab tak ke saare saboot or gavaah yah ishaara kar rahe hai kiankitkaa kaatil uskaa koi apana kareebi hi he
 Ankit's father Dharamvir Chauhan said in the DIG office of Meerut on Wednesday morning that this murder was the result of someone's rivalry with his son
 ranjish kya he or kiske saath he, unhen iskaa koi andaja nahin tha
 However, Ankit's father has called it necessary to interrogate his friends and especially Gagan, who was with Ankit at the time of the murder, to find out the crime
 kyonki unhen is baat kii behad hairaani he ki aakhir kaatilon ko kareeb se dekhne ke baavjood unhone gagan ko kaise chhod diya? B

 e kii degree lene pahunchane vaale mahaan vaigyanik charles darwin aakhir naastik kaise ho gaye? darasal darwin kii mashhoor ‘orijan of spishij bai natural sellection’ kii theory yaa kahen prakruti ke kramik parivartan kii theory kii tarah hi charles darwin bhi do saalon kii samudri jahaaj beagal kii yatra ke dauraan kramik taur par naastik hue
 Darwin was a great believer at the age of 22 when he embarked on a voyage named Beagle
 lekin is bich pathar, chattaanon, jeev, jantuon, vanaspatiyon kii utpatti kaa adhyayan karte-karte, yatra khatm hote-hote unke man main kai andeh paidaa ho gaye
 Darwin began to have doubts about the way the Bible is described (including humans, plants, animals, and all kinds of animals)
 darwin ne ‘orijan of spishij bai natural sellction’ ke naam se 1859 kitaab prakashit kii
 Darwin said that in the struggle of life, qualification wins
 jo prakruti ke anukool ban paae ve bache rahe or jo nahin ve khatm ho gaye
 The dinosaurs came to an end and the giraffe is still alive with its high neck
 matlab puri duniya kaa samudri jahaaj se chakkar lagane ke baad darwin ke bheetar bible ke kisson ko lekar shaq paidaa hue
 He gave a very revolutionary theory
 jiskaa virodh us samay jamkar hua
 Schools were banned from being taught their theory
 jeev vigyaan ke ek teacher par skool main bacchon ko darwin kii theory padhaane par kanoonee mukadmaa bhi chalaaya gaya
 The name of the case was 'monkey Trial'
 europe main ek kanoon paarit kiya gaya, jiske mutabik agar koi bible main darj sristi kii utpatti kii kahani se alag koi nai theory kaa prachaar karata he yaa phir bible kii theory ko nakaarta he to use sajaa di jaaegi
 Darwin himself writes in one of his letters, "during these two years (october 1836 to January 1839), i had the opportunity to think about religion in a manner
 jab maine beagal par apni yatra kii shuruuaat kii thi main dharm ko lekar ghor kattarwadi tha
 i remember how many of the ship's officers used to laugh at me when i presented the Bible as an irrefutable reference to many issues related to morality
 lekin jaise-jaise meraa shodh aage badhata gaya main naastik hota gaya
 In his book The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin, published in 1879, son Francis Darwin referred to the letter in which he wrote an answer to a student's question, "I am an old and sick man
" mere paas bahut kaam he
 In such a situation, i cannot waste my time answering all your questions, nor is it possible to give complete answers to them
 vigyaan kaa christ (isa) ke astitv se kuch bhi lenaa-dena nahin
 i do not believe that God would have ever communicated his nature and his motives inherent in man's creation through an angel
 ’’24 november,1880 ko likhe ek behad mashhoor khat main unhone kaha tha, ‘‘mujhe aapako yah bataane main khed he ki main bible par bharosa nahin karata
 That is why i do not believe in Jesus Christ being the child of God
 ’’ 2015 main neuyork main nilaamee ke dauraan is patr kii boli 197,000 yues dollar lagaai gai thi
 Darwin was reading each and every story of the Bible closely during his voyage while on the other side he felt the change of nature
 vaigyanik mastishk or aastik dimag ke bich ghamaasan chhidaa tha
 Science prevailed over the Bible and scientists Darwin prevailed
 kul milakar darwin kii aastik se naastik banane kii katha vistaar se bataane kaa bas ek makasad tha
 
 
 That to be a believer or an atheist requires sharp arguments
 maujuuda samay main darwin kii yah yatra un logon ko jarur padhani chahie jo kisi bhi khaas dharm kaa virodh yaa samarthan bina jaanch padtaal ke karte hai
 *** rigerv bank kii ek samiti ne sone kii maang par ankush lagane ke liye sone kii badi kharid main iskar pan (sthaayee khaataa sankhya) kaa kaa ullekhan anivaary banane kii sifarish kii he
 The committee has also proposed several measures like limiting the lending facility on gold and curbing the branches of non-banking financial units (nbfcs), which do business of lending on gold
 rigerv bank kii samiti ne nishchit seemaa se upar kii sone kii kharid main bhugtan check se karne, sone main nivesh ko hatotsahit karne ke liye duusari bachat yojanaayen pesh kiye jane, sone kii kharid ke liye bainkon se rin par roak tathaa sarrapha nigam gathan ke do dashak puraani maang ko jaise upayon ko bhi suzav diya he

" ’rigerv bank khaas sthiti main bainkon dwaara aayaat kiye jane vaale sone kii maatra tathaa mulya par seemaa laga saktaa he
 Currently, banks account for about 60 percent of the total gold imports

 usne sampatti main teevr vruddhi, sone ke evaj main karj dene vaali enbiensi dwaara diye jane vaale rin tathaa shakhaon par najar rakhe jane kii jarurat ko bhi rekhaankit kiya he
 At the same time, it is suggested to review their fund raising
 siforeeshon main swarna bank banaakar niskriy pade sone ke bhandar ke upyog kiye jane kaa bhi suzav diya he
 It is estimated that about 20,000 tonnes of gold is lying idle

 ve is baat kii ore dhyaan dilaate hai ki puraatatv vigyaan sindhu ghati kii kisi bhi sabhyataa ko madhya asia se nahin baandhta or aisa lagata he ki veda khud dakshini asia se baahar ke bhugol se bekhbar the
 Ten years ago you could support Sanyal's installations from a genetic perspective
 us vakt tak mitocondria ke aadhaar par matruvansh kii pahchaan hi nishkarsh kaa ek saadhan hua karti thi
 It was known from this that all humans have come out of Africa
 uske aadhaar par mili sakshya is ore thos rup se ishaara karte hai ki dakshin asian aabaadi kii jaden apane upmahadweep main hi hai
 Other researchers were looking for ancestry based on the coupling of the y chromosome
 in nateezon se nikle sakshya kahin zyada sandigdh the
 a more similar South Asian Yi lineage R1A1A is also very similar in Eastern Europe and Central Asia
 is vanshavali kii khoj karne waal genetic vigyaani spencer wales kehete hai ki nabbe ke dashak ke ant main kiya unka kaam ''is baat kaa thos sanket detaa he ki 5,000 saal pehle purvi europe or madhya asia ke stapi se bharat kii ore paryaapt palaayan hua tha
 "wales associated it with the Banjaras who speak Indian languages and they believe that the recent results are saying the same thing
" jaahir he, yah mitocondria ke aadhaar par nikaale gaye nishkarshon se hatakar he
 Since R1A1A is not very diverse, it is difficult to understand where or when it originated
 wales ko chhodkar kai shodhakartaaon kaa kahana tha ki aar1e1e ho saktaa he, vishuddh dakshin asian hi rahaa ho
 Today we know more about R1A1A than before
 pehle shodhakarta vaai chromosome par kuchhek sau markaron ko dekhte the yaa phir un kshetron ko jahaan saghanta zyada thi lekin aaj takreeban puure vaai chromosome kii hi sikvencing kar lee gai he
 Confirming the initial skepticism of Wales, many researchers today believe that R1A1A may have entered South Asia 4,000 to 5,000 years before Eurasian steppe
 aar1e1e ke vividhtapurna na hone kii ek vajah yah he ki uskaa haal hi main bade paimaane par vistaar hua he; kvauteshnon ko ikatthe hue bahut vakt nahin gujara he
 From the complete genome analysis we can find that the lineage of Eastern European R1A1A is the same while its Central Asian and South Asian versions are the same
 biemasi parche ke sahalekhak martin richards kehete hai, ''yah haai rejolution hamen vistrut vanshavali soochna or sateek genetic dating muhaiyaa karwaata he—isliye ham dekh pate hai ki vanshawaliyaan kab or kahaan nai shakhaon main parivartit ho jaati hai
 "ancient DNA has also shed light on the relationship between the various branches of R1A1A"
 madhya asia ke vilupt gadriye, skythian or unke bhugolic parijan srubana log jo 3,750 saal pehle caspian sagar ke uttar main rahaa karte the, unamem bhi yahi vaai vanshavali milti he
 It is worth noting that the R1a1a lineage of Scythians and Srubna does not belong to Europeans but to Central Asians and South Asians
 mitocondria ke aadhaar par mili nishkarsh or vaai chromosome ke aadhaar par nikali vanshavali ke bich ke virodhabhas ko bhi ab hal kar liya gaya he
 The answer is that there was no sexual balance in the migration that took place in India
 biemasi ke parche main yah ek ahm bindu he
 "there was a clear gender bias in the arrival of new people, especially from the Steppes region of Eastern Europe in the copper age," says Richdras (similar is the case in Europe where predominantly men who emigrated from Steppi were men)
 aaj hamaari samajhadaari akele vaai chromosome yaa mitocondrial diene adhyayan tak simit nahin he
 Today, while the entire genome can be studied, scientists have renewed our understanding of South Asia's past
 2013 main anuvanshiki vigyaani priya moorajaani or unke sahyogiyon ne ek shodh prakashit kiya tha jiskaa nishkarsh tha ki 2,000 se 4,000 saal pehle bhartiya upmahadweep main do nihaayat alahada aabaadiyon kaa mishran ho rahaa tha
 Moorjani says that "4,000 years ago, there existed pure and unmixed ANI and ASI groups in the Indian subcontinent
" ''paitruk uttar bharatiyon ko eeni or paitruk dakshin bharatiyon ko ees kehete hai
 The ANI population consisted of West Asians and Europeans at the genetic level
 bhartiya mul ke is model ko viksit karne vaale ek moulik shodhakarta nik patterson eeni or europea aabaadiyon ke bich genetic duuri ko itnaa kam karke bataate hai ki agar aapako kisi kii utpatti kaa pataa nahin he to aap use europea aabaadi qaraar denge
 On the other hand, no close relatives of ASI are found
 ve andaman ke mul nivaasiyon ke sudur parijan the
 Murjani also states that although there may have been a non-mixed population representing these groups in recent past, all South Asian natives today seem to derive from both
 moorajaani ne 2013 ke apane parche main anumaan lagaaya tha ki tamilnadu ke dalit 40 fisadi eeni hai (baaki jahiraa taur par ees)
 Pathans are 70 per cent ANI, Kashmiri Pandits 65 per cent ANI, while Brahmins and Kshatriyas of Uttar Pradesh are 55 to 60 per cent ANI
 jab eeni or ees ke mishran kii baat aati he to ise pataa karne ke do niyam hai
 The more you go northwest, the more ANI you get
 ucch jatiyon main zyada eeni paae jate hai (bengali or munda janajati purvi asian hai jo na eeni he or na hi ees)
 a similar pattern can be predicted from the R1A1A lineage of the y chromosome, which geneticists estimate may have arrived from Central Asia 4,000–5,000 years ago
 aabaadi se judi anuvanshiki par najar rakhane vaale bhartiya paryvekshakon ne in nishkarshon ko apni samajhadaari main pirone kaa kaam kiya he
 Sanyal says that "indians are a mixture of many genetic streams, especially ANI and ASI that have been living in the Indian subcontinent since the Stone Age
" '' moorajaani kahati hai ki unhone apane adhyayan main ''palaayan kii disha par vishisht kaam nahin kiya he'' lekin ve maanati hai ki ''eeni tak palaayan kii disha bharat kii ore hi rahi
 "why are they saying this?" Let us first address two points contained in the out-of-india proposition
 jaisaa ki sanyaal kehete hai, dakshini asia or madhya asia ke bich puratathvik sambandh sookshm hai
 The Aryans do not remember the pre-india period, but discoveries in ancient DNA during the last 10 years have shown that wherever there was no migration to archaeologists, there was a mass exodus
 iske bhautik record adhure hai lihaaja ise itihaas ke vyapak chalan ke saath jodpha aasaan nahin he, lekin iskaa ek ansh yah kahata he ki kuch aabaadi, jaise banjaare, apane peeche puratathvik nishaan nahin chhod jaati
 As far as the arguments of Indian religious and oral history are concerned, it should be noted that the memory of the people of Greece is not even before Greece, although they are as ancient as the Indians
 is maamle main saanskrithik smritiyon ke aadhaar par koi faisla isiilie nahin diya ja saktaa
 This is the reason why there is only one solution to all uncertainties - ancient DNA
 paanch hajaar se das hajaar saal pehle europe kaa nikatavarti purv or europe ke namoonon kaa pareekshan dikhaata he ki palaayan ke kuch adhyyon ke baad vah prabhutvkaari genetic pattern ubhara jise ham aaj dekh pate hai
 We have a substantial sample of ancient people from the Near East, Central Asia and Europe of Europe, on the basis of which we find that there have been huge changes in population during the last ten thousand years
 to kya ham bharat ko isse kuch alag maan sakate hai?dakshin asian genetic paridrishy kii ek samajhadaari kaayam karne ke liye yah jaananaa jaruri he ki pashchimi uresia kii do pracheen aabaadiyon kii is upmahadweep ke logon se kaaphi nikatataa he
 First, the early farmers of western Iran who were in Jagros
 unki viraasat aaj samooche uresia main pai jaati he or bharat ke kai aabaadi samoohon ke saath unki samanthaayen mili hai
 Secondly, the copper age steppes of the Yamna culture in the copper age, which existed from 4,000 to 5,500 years ago
 inaki dakshin asian logon se, khaskar uttar pashchimi kshetra or brahmanon ke saath kaaphi zyada samanta he
 Yamna culture was in the Pontic Stepi from 4,000 to 2,300 BC after the copper age and early in the Bronze Age
 yamana samskruti proto-indo-europea ke saath judi he
 Researchers at David Raisch's lab in Harvard tested which potential groups might have produced the ANI element in South Asians
 kaaphi saghan tulana ke baad unhone paaya ki eeni kaa sabase sahi model pontic gadariyon or aadim irani kisaanon ke saquimshran ke taur par banataa he
 The Ocean of Churn states that thoughts and humans move in both directions
 pithagoras or aflatoon ke madhyam se bharat ke dharmik vichaaron or falsafe kaa pashchim par prabhaav padaa
 In contrast, the possible origin of the Indian alphabet may have been in the Near East of Europe, while both Islam and Christianity had their roots in this subcontinent
 yahi haal jeens kaa bhi he
 South Asian genetic markers are found in southeastern Asia from Thailand to Bali
 iske ulat, bengali, asamiya or munda logon kii dakshin-purvi viraasat unke chehron or jeens main dikhti he or khaskar munda ke maamle main to yah samanta unki bhashaa se jaahir hoti he
 This idea of gene flow however has some limitations
 bharat kii vishisht genetic viraasat ees kii jaden bhale upmahadweep main gahari hon or iskaa kahin or kii aabaadi ke saath nikatavarti rishta na ho lekin iran or afghanistan main kam anupaat main hi sahi, ye milti hai
 Assuming the Roma people to be an exception, asi's legacy is absent throughout Western Eurasia (roma are nomadic people who live mainly in the Eurom and the Americas
 ve mulat: uttar bharat ke rajasthan, haryana or punjab ilaake ke rahane vaale the)
 This suggests that the migration to the west outside of India was very rare in the last few thousand years because, as Murjani says, the ancestry of all the population of India has been of ASI in the last 4,000 years
 kai genetic vigyaani ab maanate hai ki niolithik or tamra yug main madhya uresia va pashchimi asia se dakshin asia main bade paimaane par palaayan hua tha or yahi hamaare paas maujuud aankadon ko samajhane kaa sabase sahaj model he
 The model of Out of India is not theoretically impossible, but to many people it seems far-fetched to interpret the data collected
 sambhaavnaaon ke paar jane ke liye hamen waapas usee cheez par lautnaa hoga jisane ateet main hamen raah dikhaai he: pracheen dine
 Unfortunately, no ancient data from South Asia is available
 aaj bhi shodhakarta haryana ke rakhigadhi se jutaaye harappakalin namoonon ke aadhaar par genetic nattejey nikaalane main jute hue hai
 The probabilities can be overcome after the results of their sample testing
 india today ko pataa chalaa he ki rakhigadhi se jutaaye namoonon se nikle nateezon kaa elaan isi saal sitambar main hona he
