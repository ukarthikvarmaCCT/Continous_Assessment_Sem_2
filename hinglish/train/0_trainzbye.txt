 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to the upcoming Election Special News Letter aatankiyon kii intercept kol se hua tha dhamaakon kaa khulhasabatla house encounter ke baad shuru hui siyasat Iqbal Mirchi's close Humayun Merchant arrested: Iqbal Mirchi's power of attorney Humayun is being tightened by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) over Iqbal Mirchi, close to underworld don Dawood
 idi ne mangalvaar ko ikbaal mirchi ke kareebi humayu marchent ko giraftaar kar liya
 He has the power of attorney of Iqbal Mirchi
 ab use dopaher 1 baje mumbai ke court main pesh kiya jayega
 The ED is set to attach the disputed 15-storey CJ house in order to probe the alleged property deals of Iqbal Mirchi, who was close to fugitive underworld don Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar, along with former Union Minister Praful Patel
 isse pehle idi ne shuukravaar ko mirchi ke parijanon or purv kendriya mantri evam rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) netaa patel se mani londring maamle main 12 ghante se adhik samay tak poochtacha kii thi
 According to a senior ED official involved in the investigation, during the interrogation, Patel admitted that he had made deals with members of Mirchi's family
 adhikari ne bataaya ki agency ko die apane bayaan main ensipi netaa ne kaha ki unhen is baat kii jaankaree nahin thi ki ikbaal memon urf ikbaal mirchi hi vahi aadmi tha
 The CJ House officer also said that Patel has told the Financial Investigation Agency in his statement that the deal between Millennium Developers controlled by him and his wife Varsha was finalized by a relative who died a few years ago
 is
 adhikari ne kaha ki aane vaale dinon main idi dhanshodhan nirodhak adhinium-2002 (mani londring) ke tahat sije house ko kurk karegaa, kyonki agency kaa maananaa he ki mirchi ke parivaar ne is property ke liye jurm kii rakam kaa istemaal kiya he

 The ED has identified Mirchi and her family in India as well as several properties located in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United Kingdom (UK)
 sampatti aparaadh ke dhan se kharide jane kaa andeh he
 (with IANS input) purv ipies adhikari or dilli chunaav main bijepi kii siem ummidavaar raheen kiran bedi kaa maananaa he ki ve fatve kii vajah se haar gayi
 He has complained about this to the Election Commission
 ise aap kya kahenge- khisiani billi khamba noche, yaa ahamed bukhari kaa maan badhanaa
 It can be assumed that anyone can say anything in the face of defeat, so it is presumed that he has raised the value of the controversial Imam Bukhari of Delhi's largest mosque
 bukhari ne aam aadmi party ko vot dene kii apil kii thi
 The party flatly refused to seek his support and the Muslims themselves were stunned at the controversial imam's appeal
 imaamon kaa kaam he masjid main namaaj padhaanaa or khaali vakt main vahiin ke makatab main bacchon ko urdu or dharmik shiksha dena
 The local committees of the mosque have fixed the salaries of the Imams and Mujazins, which somehow makes them go home
 zyaadaatar islamic deshon main bhi unhen sirf namaaj padhaane tak simit rakhaa gaya he
 The Imams of Saudi Arabia's two major mosques are also no exception
 imam masjid main kya bolenge or nahin bolenge iske liye bhi kabhi-kabhi sarkarein disha nirdesh detii hai, jaisaa ki misr main ho chukaa he
 Therefore, the Imam's work is limited
 samudaay ke zyaadaatar logon ko isamen tanik andeh nahin he
 Then how is Imam Bukhari so important? Leaders like Bedi have always raised the value of Bukhari
 media main kattar hindu netaaon ke bayaan ko baraabar karne ke liye bukhari ko netaa banaaya, taaki yah kaha ja sake ki ek taraf praveen togdipha, sakshi maharaj yaa yogi adityanath hai to duusari ore bukhari hai, baat baraabar ho gai
 Actually, the matter is not equal because Togadia, Sakshi or Adityanath may have the support, but Bukhari is not at all
 vaise, bukhari khud ko 'imam-e-hind’ (hindustan kaa leader) sabit karne kii koshish karte rahe hai, lekin allamaa ikbaal ne yah darja bahut pehle bhagwaan ram ko de diya tha, or unki jagah is mulk main koi nahin le saktaa
 Bukhari does not even have enough support to win any MLA in his area
 jama masjid ilaake main rahane vaali shiba asalam falahi yaa samaajawaadee party netaa ajam khan samet kai log isaki tasdik kar sakate hai
 This situation has been there for more than two decades
 ve bijepi samet lagbhag har party ke pahn or virodh main apil kar chuke hai
 The reality is that Bukhari's political appeal to the people of the community has the opposite effect
 unhen lagane lagata he ki bukhari phir kisi se mil gaye hai or samudaay kaa sauda kar lenge
 In such a situation, it may also be that Kiran Bedi's vote has increased due to Bukhari's statement
 lekin bedi ne apane bayaan se bukhari kaa maan badha diya
 By the way, he has raised a right issue - the political appeal of the Imams should be stopped
 saath hi, baabaaon, santon, dharm guruon aadi ko bhi aisa karne se rokna chahie
 This also applies to Baba Ram Rahim and Baba Ramdev
 nagaland ke dimapur main bheed ke haathon peet-petakar maar die gaye kathith balaatkaar ke aaropee ke bhai jamaluddin khan ne daawa kiya he ki jis mahila ne unke bhai ke khilaaf rape kii praathmiki darj karai thi, medical reports main uske saath aisi koi bhi ghatana saamne nahin ai

 i refused to go on this, but he told me that everything is fine when i am with him
 ' Along with this he told, 'after some time, he went away to meet some of his friends

 He also took the police to the dock and said that she was sitting idle at the time of the incident
 jamaluddin khan ne kaha, 'kya nagaland sarkaar jangalraj chalaa rahi he? jis ladki ne praathmiki darj karai vah rishte main mere bhai kii patni kii bahan lagati he
 Nagaland police has also said that the medical report has not confirmed the rape
 ' Jamaluddin said that many people from my family are in the army, how can he kill him as a Bangladeshi? My brother was made a scapegoat
 unhone kaha ki vah or unke ek or bhai, kamaal khan is vakt bhartiya sena kii assam regiment main hai
 Another of his brothers, Imamuddin Khan, was also in the army and was martyred in the 1999 Kargil Battle
 unke pita, saiyad hossain khan, bhartiya vaayu sena se ritair hue the or maa abhi unki pension le rahi hai
 Jamaluddin Khan claimed that his family hails from Karimganj district of Assam
 is puure maamle main kai sawaal ek saath khadey hote dikhaai de rahe hai
 The question is also about Syed Sharifuddin Khan being accused, on the basis of which medical report, he was made accused of rape from a Naga woman
 peedita kahaan kii rahane vaali he, is baat ko lekar bhi sawaal uth rahe hai or kis aadhaar par police ne shuruyaat main hi yah daawa kiya ki saiyad sharifuddin khan avaidh rup se rah rahaa bangladeshi he
 Significantly, on Thursday, Syed Sharifuddin Khan was beaten to death by a mob
 dimapur ke central jail main rape ke aarope main band sharifuddin ko do hajaar logon kii gussai bheed ne baahar nikaala or nagn avasthaa main parade karaayaa
 The mob continued to kill them until they died and then hanged their corpses from the clock tower
 naga civil sosayadi ne haalanki is ghatana kii ninda kii he lekin centre or rajya sarkaar ke karyaalayon par hamalaa bhi bolaa
 The organization alleged that both governments are negligent about the Bangladeshis living in the area illegally
 yah bhi kaha gaya ki sandigdh saiyad sharifuddin ek avaidh rup se rah rahaa bangladeshi hi tha
 Naga council general secretary Joel Naga said, 'we are angry with the vote bank policy of the Assam government
 sirf 50 rupye kharch kar koi bhi bharat kii naagarikta hasil kar saktaa he or yahaan naukari bhi shuru kar saktaa he
 We see Khan as an illegal Bangladeshi, even if he has documentary proofs

 Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray has indicated that he has no objection if Raj Thackeray wants to shake hands with him
 is bayaan se to aisa hi lag rahaa he ki siyasat main alag-alag raah chunane vaale uddhav or raaj thakare saath ho jaaenge
 The second episode of the interview in three episodes in the Sena mouthpiece Saamna has been published on Wednesday
 uddhav ne isamen jo kuch kaha he usase saaf he ki raaj agar chahen to unhen haath milaane main koi hichak nahin
 According to Uddhav, 'if anyone comes to us from the heart, i will welcome it
 'is saakshaatkaar main uddhav ne aisi kai baaten kahi hai jisase lagata he ki raaj thakare ko lekar unka rukh naram padaa he or agar raaj haath badhayen to uddhav use tham sakate he

 ' yani, agar raaj pahal karen to donon ke saath aane kii sambhaavnaaon ke daravaaje khule hai
 When this same question was asked again if he would come together, Uddhav said, 'how can you just ask me this question? i am ready to answer, but you should sit with both of us and do this question

 Uddhav's stance on Raj is also indicated by another reply in which he does not hold MNS alone responsible for the Marathi vote bank sharing
 uddhav kii baton se saaf he ki unhen raaj se haath milaane main koi hichak to nahin lekin iske liye raaj ko bhi ek kadam badhanaa hoga
 In an answer in the interview, this confusion is also revealed in which he says, 'I can answer this question right now, but what if there is something else on his mind

 Kolkata defeated Gujarat by 10 wickets in their first match of the tournament
 agle match main captain gambhir ke saamne dilli ke hi viraat kohli hai
 The Bangalore team has so far won only 2 out of 6 matches
 lekin pichley match main haar ke baad gambhir ab aankadon ke khel main shaayad hi ulajhna chahen
 Both Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli not only make aggressive calls but also appear in a similar manner on the field

 team main umesh yadav (7 wicket), nathan coolter nile (6 wicket) or kuldeep yadav (5 wicket) jaise dhakad gendbaaz match kaa rukh badalane kaa madda rakhte hai

 You too must have created an altercation, anger and sometimes non-talkative relationship with your mother at some point, but after teenage, when the understanding starts, the mother slowly starts becoming friends

 # fidelcastro The speech of 80-year-old Ram Naik, the Governor of Uttar Pradesh, was hotly debated in the Assembly meeting at 3 pm on February 23
 tabhi achaanak sapa sarkaar main sansadeey kaary or nagar vikaas mantri ajam khan ek khaas mishan par dilli kii ore ud chale
 He reached Rashtrapati Bhavan directly and opened the box of complaints of the Governor in front of President Pranab Mukherjee
 unhone raashtrapati se nik ke 'betuke' bayanon ko sangyaan main lete hue kadaa faisla sunaane kii apil kii
 After spending more than 20 minutes at Rashtrapati Bhavan, Azam Khan returned to Lucknow late in the evening
 lekin ek mantri ke sidhe raashtrapati se rajyapal kii shikaayat karne kii jo misaal unhone pesh kii, upi kii raajnneeti main uskaa koi doosraa udhaaharan maujuud nahin he
 Ram Naik, who started his journey from Jana Sangh to politics, has been the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government at the Center
 pichley saal 22 july ko upi ke rajyapal kii kursi sanbhaalane ke baad kai aise maukey or mudde aae, jab unhone sarkaar ke rukh ke ulat apana rukh jaahir kiya (dekhen box)
 Cabinet Minister Azam Khan has been an important link in the confrontation between the Raj Bhavan and the government
 maujuuda samay main ajam khan kii is takaraar kii vajah nik ke rampur ke 'mohammad ali johar trust' ko 'johar shodh santhaan' kaa bhawan dene ke sarkaar ke faisle par aapatti uthaanaa thi
 After this, Azam wrote a four-page long letter to Naik on February 11, trying to show that his work is causing a lot of fear among Muslims
 donon ke bich is takaraar kii shuruyaat pichley saal hui thi
 In fact, the governor strongly objected to Azam Khan's statement that he had spent money at Mulayam Singh Yadav's birthday celebrations in Rampur to meet anti-national forces like the Taliban and Dawood Ibrahim
 yah baat media ke saamne tanj ke taur par kahi gai thi
 Earlier Azam Khan's former governor T

 el
 There has also been a confrontation with Joshi
 vajah ajam kaa vahi purana dream project
 They wanted Maulana Mohammad Ali Johar University of Rampur to be given the status of a minority institution and the Governor was objecting to it
 haalanki pichley saal july main kuch samay ke liye rajyapal rahe ajij kuraishi ke sambandh ajam se thik rahe or johar vishvavidhyalay ko alpsankhyak kaa darja mil gaya
 Aziz Qureshi, currently serving as the Governor of Mizoram, says, "when i was the Governor of UP, politics in the Raj Bhavan was not allowed to dominate
 ram nik or ajam ko aapas main baithkar vivaad suljhaana chahie
 Naik's activism since becoming governor has given rise to many controversies on the one hand, and on the other hand has also introduced some new traditions that have given a new identity to the Raj Bhavan
 shaayad yahi vajah thi ki pichley saal rashtriya adhiveshan main sapa ne apane rajnatik prastaav main rajyapal nik ke mukhyamantri kii tarah kaam karne ke taur-tareekon par kadi aapatti jataai thi
 Pulling on New Traditions Ram Naik had immediately banned the use of the words 'his Majesty' or 'his Excellence' with the Governor's designation since assuming the responsibility of Governor in July last year
 inke sthaan par ab 'mananeey' yaa 'onorable' shabd kaa prayog hota he
 Not only this, for the first time he started giving the details of his work in a press conference from Raj Bhavan
 unke ye taur-tareeke vipakshi partiyon ke bich aalochana kaa centre ban gaye hai
 Pradeep Mathur, leader of the Congress Legislature Party, says, "governors always want to be in the news
 maine ab tak kisi rajyapal ko aise kaam karte nahin dekha
 The Governor's activism was also the center of discussion at the meeting of party leaders at Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) headquarters in Lucknow on 15 February
 bispi kii rashtriya adhyaksh mayawati boleen, ''press conference ke jariye rajyapal kii nai parampara kii shuruyaat par raashtrapati yaa centre sarkaar ko jarur sangyaan lenaa chahie ki yah sahi he ki galat
 This is so obvious that the weakness of the SP government is being expressed by this
 '' duusari ore rajnatik vishleshak rajyapal ke is kadam ko ek seemaa tak sahi tehra rahe hai
 The head of the Department of Political Science at the prestigious Shibli National College, Azamgarh, Dr
 giyas asad khan kehete hai, ''samvidhan main aisi koi baadhyataa nahin he ki governor press conference nahin kar sakate, lekin aam taur par aisa dekhne ko nahin miltaa
 If they want to tell something about themselves, then there is nothing wrong in that
 ''patari par aae vishvavidhyalayarajyapal or kuladhipati nik ko soobe main ucch shiksha kii badahaali viraasat main mili thi
 One-third of the total two dozen universities in UP were running on the confidence of the acting vice chancellors
 varanasi ke sampoornanand sanskrit vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati bindaa prasad ke khilaaf jaanch chal rahi thi
 In several other universities, including Meerut and Kanpur, swords were drawn between the vice-chancellor and the registrar

 The first concerned the government and the second chancellor secretariat

 Chancellor of King George Medical University, Lucknow, Prof
 ravikant kehete hai, ''rajyapal ne sabase pehle yah spasht kar diya ki vishvavidhyalay main kulapati hi sarvocch he
 This led to the factionalism within the campus ending in a jolt
 '' nik kaa yogadan vishvavidhyalayon main deree se chal rahe shaikshik satron ko patari par laana bhi he
 For the first time this year, annual examinations have started in all the universities of the state simultaneously

 Says Ravikant, "for the first time, monitoring of every university has started from the Chancellor's Office so that there is no loss of students in any way
 '' vishvavidhyalayon main kaaphi samay se lambit chaatrasangh chunaav bhi agle shaikshik satr se lingadoh samiti kii siforeeshon ke anusaar honge

 panch kii bhoomika main rajbhavanpichhali garmi main koyale kii kami se jab upi ke bijli ghar karaah rahe the, centre or rajya sarkaar ke bich kii tanatani ne halaat or bigaad die the
 Union Coal Minister Piyush Goyal was accusing Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav of not talking to him, while the Chief Minister accused the Central Government of discrimination
 koyale par lagaataar bad rahi garmahat ke bich nik 'panch' kii bhoomika main aae
 On his initiative, in the first week of September last year, Goyal and Akhilesh Yadav got an immediate solution to the problem by talking over the phone
 baad main 3 disambar ko donon netaa dilli main mili or upi ko 30-40 karod ton utpaadan kshamta vaale koyala block ke aavanton par centre ne sahmati jataa di
 Not only this, the Governor had to intervene as the conflict between the Municipal Corporation and the local district administration escalated for the Solid Waste Management Plant closed at Karsara in Varanasi, the Parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the sewage treatment plant to be built on the banks of the Varuna River
 
 nik ne pichley saal 18 disambar ko varanasi ke meyar ramgopal mohale or akhilesh yadav ko aamane-saamne bithakar shahar ke vikaas main aa rahi adchane dur karvaa deen
 Says Mohale, "the Governor puts his point very politely in front of all the leaders and that is why they are getting support from everyone
" ''pichley saal 29 sitambar ko lakhanu main vidyut niamak ayog ke bhawan ke shilanyas samaaroh ke dauraan apane bhaashan main nik is bhawan ke 2016 main taiyaar hone kii baat kehete hi puch baithe, ''agle chunaav main kitna samay baaki he?'' akhilesh yadav sawaal kaa mantavya samajhate hue manch par baithe hue hi bole, ''aapkaa aashirwad rahaa to main 2017 tak siem rahoonga
 "naik retorted and said," It is good, till then i will also stay and you will also stay
 '' rajbhavan or sarkaar ke bich takaraahat to jagajaahir he
 But it is also certain that if the government and the Raj Bhavan do not fulfill their responsibilities within the scope of the constitution, by 2017, mutual conflict will also rise
 It's all OK when it's DK https: / / t
 co / rxd9vdbawe yah sochna naadaani he ki lokapal naam kii sanstha har kism ke bhrashtachar ko jad se khatm kar degi
 Going to the bottom of it, the picture looks frightening
 satarkta main jaraa-si chook hui to sansthaanon kii bheed main lokapal shaitani rup bhi ikhtiyaar kar saktaa he
 Realizing a strong Lokpal on the ground of reality is equivalent to laying the foundation for a parallel government
 maan lijie ki centre sarkaar ke 60 lakh karmchaariyon ke sambandh main har saal lokapal ke paas 10 lakh shikaayatein aati hai to is hisaab se maanav sansaadhan or vittiya kharch kii baari-bharkam jarurat to saamne aegi hi, saath hi bhrashtachar ko khatm karne ke liye banaai gai sanstha ke bheetar hi bhrashtachar kii nai paudh panapana shuru ho jaaegi
 a voluntary organization called Public Interest Foundation has gathered information through RTI applications that most of the Lokayuktas have thousands of cases pending for more than three years
 in maamalon main jaanch, sunwaayee or sajaa ke aankade bhi behatar nahin hai
 Research conducted by the Azim Premji Foundation has revealed that the Lokayukta of Karnataka has such a burden of complaints related to corruption that even the hearing of five-year-old cases could not be completed
 jinamein sunwaayee puri hui bhi he to vahaan sajaa dene kii dar bahut kharaab he
 Apart from this, they are accepted without verifying the truth of the complaints, so a lot of time is spent by the specialized staff made for it
 mukhya nirvachan ayukta ke karyaalay main bhi apilon ke nistaaran sambandhi aankade yahi kahani kehete hai
 Therefore, to think that the Jan Lokpal Bill is the only solution to all problems, the matter will be simplified
 isse na to vyavastha durust hogi, na prashasnic sansthaanon main sudhaar aayega
 We should keep in mind that in the excitement of a strong Lokpal, we are not hurting the delicate balance between the legislature, judiciary and executive with the check and balance system of the constitution
 loktantr kaa buniyadi siddhant takaton kaa vikendrikaran he na ki kisi ek sanstha main uskaa kendrikaran
 Parliament's supremacy has been recognized in a democracy
 lokapal ke liye purna swaittata or sibiai tathaa sivisi jaisi sansthaaon ko uske daayre main laana naukarshahi kaa ek doosraa silsilaa kaayam karne ke alaava kuch bhi or nahin he
 It is not necessary to give a strong ombudsman the right of unhindered surveillance on the CBI, CVC and the judiciary
 lokapal sanstha ke karmchaariyon ke haath main jaanch, sunwaayee, anushaasanamak dand, parisampattiyon kii jabti or yahaan tak ki ardhanyayik adhikaar dene kaa maamla bahes ke vishay hai
 Giving the Lokpal the job of supervising various institutions would be like making him a Super Inspector (supercop)
 prabhaavshaalee lokapal par bahes ke dauraan hamane nirnay karne kii lagbhag thap padi prakriya ko hi nazarandaaj kar diya he
 Any move to discourage honest officers from taking decisions will hurt the national interest
 nitigat faisle hameshaa kuch pusht tathyon ke aadhaar par kiye jate hai
 Any action that would hurt the public interest will stall the decision process
 masalan, is kism kaa siddhant tex prashasan main barason ke udaaravaadi upayon yaa punargathan ke baad tay kiye gaye shulk par bhi sawaal khadaa kar saktaa he
 We should not ignore the fact that a civil servant is as patriotic as civil society claims to be
 hamen yaad rakhana chahie ki uske upar avishvaas yaa andeh kaa ek bhi ansh un sansthaanon or uske karypalkon kii vishwasaneeyata ko mitaa degaa jinhen samvidhan ne vishisht nyaayik adhikaar die hai
 The solution lies in placing competent people on top of constitutional and statutory institutions
 lokapal ke paas maamalon kii jaanch, sunwaayee or uchit karrwai ke adhikaar hone chahie lekin use apane staff or sahyogi sansthaanon kii madad se ye kaam karne chahie
 The Lokpal can be empowered to investigate and seize assets under certain pre-defined codes and principles
 apane kaam ke tareeke, prashasnic or vittiya adhikaron ke sandarbh main lokapal ko swaittata honi chahie taaki vah varisht naukarshahon or rajanetaaon ke khilaaf shikayaton par khud ko kendrit kar sake
 It is too early to pass the Lokpal Bill without getting into the legal and constitutional aspects until the provision of the formation of state level Lokayuktas is completed
 kai rajyon main lokayukta kaa gathan ho chukaa he
 In this regard, the law passed recently by the Khanduri government of Uttarakhand is commendable
 yah kanoon un rajyon ke liye udhaaharan ban saktaa he jahaan ab tak lokayukta nahin hai
 We need a balanced Lokpal Bill and its time has come
 isamen hui der desh bhar main iske paksh main ban chuki lahar ke khilaaf hi jaaegi
 Apart from this, many other measures have to be taken to strengthen our campaign against corruption

 Russell targeted Raina for 22 runs in his one over
 isse pehle raina ne toss jitkar mejabaan team ko pehle ballebaaji ke liye aamantrit kiya
 Munaf vindicated West Indies as Kirk Edwards (00) in the second over of the innings, vindicating the captain's decision
 lindal simons (45) or ramanaresh sarwan (28) ne duusare wicket ke liye 65 ran jode
 After Sarwan's run out, Mishra gave three blows, putting pressure on the opposition batsmen

 '' dilli ke buraadi ilaake main ek lau student kii goli maar kar hatya kar di gai
 Earlier, the student went for a walk with his two colleagues
 tabhi bike savaar ek shaks unke paas pahunchakar gaali galoch karne laga
 When they tried to stop the bike rider, he fired
 mritak chaatraki pahchaan ashish bharadwaj ke rup main hui he
 Whose age is 24 years
 mritak chaatr mul rup se bihar kaa rahane vaala tha
 He was pursuing law at a private university in Gurgaon
 vah buraadi thana aria ke jharoda main rent par rahata tha
 Ashish was walking on the road with his two friends on Thursday night
 tino students ring road ke paas naale ke kinare tahal rahe the
 Suddenly a drunken man came riding on the bike and started abusing the three students
 usne kandhe par dunali bandook taang rakhi thi
 When the students tried to convince him, he threatened to shoot them
 iske baad ashish ke donon saathiyon ne us shaks ko pakad liya
 Then the man opened fire with his gun
 jo sidhi ashish bharadwaj ke gale main jaakar lagi
 He bled and fell on the road there
 uske saathiyon ne ghayal ashish aspataal le jane ke liye kai auto or gaadi waalon se madad maangi
 But no one stopped
 kohre main andheri sadak par donon ladke gadiyon ko rukne ke liye haath se ishaara karte rahe, magar lutpaat ke dar se vahaan kisi ne gaadi nahin roki
 By then Ashish had lost a lot of blood
 goli lagane ke kareeb pandraa minute baad use aspataal le jaaya gaya
 Where Ashish died during treatment
 aas-paas ke logon kaa kahana he ki is ilaake main police koi gasht nahin karti
 Therefore, looting is common here
 jis sadak par ye chaatr raat gyaarah baje andhere main ghoomane gaye the
 There is also no street light
 philhal, buraadi thana police ne shav ko kabje main lekar postmortem ke liye bhej diya he
 Now the police is trying to find out who was the attacker on the bike
 saath hi ye bhi ki biker kii kahani sach he yaa maamla kuch or he
 Police is investigating the case from several angles

 ' On a hot summer morning in Zirakpur, Punjab, peeping out from the large grounds of a farmhouse, a view of a different world is seen
 gaur se dekhen to aapako lagegaa ki aap sidhe rio di generio pahunch gaye hai, khaskar brazil ke uttar-pashchimi kinare par based is sabase mashhoor shahar ke olympic shooting centre main
 And the date, suppose the morning of August 8, 2016
 vahaan aapako bharat ke ekmaatr vyaktigat olympic swarna padak vijeta abhinav bindra dikhaai dete hai, jo hare-bhare maidan kii prishthbhumi main nishshabdata kii tasviir maaloom hote hai
 They are aiming at small circular circles made at a distance of 10 meters
 aap unhen chupchaap lagaataar nishaanaa lagaate hue dekhte hai, or munh se ek bhi shabd nikaalane se darate hai ki kahin unki ekaagratha main kisi tarah kaa vyavdhaan na pad jaae
 For several months, Bindra has been using the secret route to reach the Olympic ground through his farmhouse
 or vaastaviktaa, jo haalanki utani shandaar nahin dikh rahi, lekin prerana dene vaali jarur he
 When Bindra went to Rio in 2015 for an event examining the preparations, he took pictures of the shooting range from every angle and sent those pictures to his mother Babli
 ve jab rio se waapas laute, tab tak unki maa ne apane ghar ke peeche ke bageeche main bane unke nijee shooting range ko hu-ba-hu rio ke shooting range main tabdeel kar diya tha, taaki jab ve vahaan shooting karen—apane duusare olympic swarna ke liye—to unhen kuch is tarah mahasoos ho ki jaise ve apane ghar par hi hai
 But not every athlete has the privilege of having such facilities since birth just like Bindra
 phir bhi olympic main hissaa lene ke liye rio ja rahaa bharat kaa har khilaadi deewangi kii had tak josh se labalab bharaa he or shaareerik tathaa maansik rup se khud ko taiyaar karne main juta he
 If wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, who won a bronze medal at the 2012 London Olympics, is looking to increase his stamina by practicing five hours a day in a room whose temperature is similar to the temperature of a place at the height of a mountain, Deepa Karmakar, She is the first Indian woman gymnast to qualify for the Olympics, capturing herself at the Indira Gandhi indoor stadium in Delhi
 is baar olympic main hissaa lene ja rahe 121 bhartiya khiladinnon kaa dal isse pehle ke olympic aayojanon main gaye kisi bhi dal se bilkul alag he
 If you talk to the athletes of this team, you will find that there has been a big change in the way these players think in the last eight years — ever since Bindra created history in Beijing in the morning
 ve sirf koi bhi padak mil jane kii ummid nahin kar rahe hai, balki ab ve sidhe swarna padak jeetne kaa jajba paale hue hai
 Whether they win the gold medal or not, it no longer matters
 asli baat yah he ki ab unhen lagata he, ve jeet sakate hai, ve sirf haarane vaale naakaabil pratiyogi nahin hai, ve sirf ginati puri karne ke liye nahin ja rahe hai, ve vahaan apana sapana puraa karne ke liye harsambhav prayaas kar rahe hai—bhartiya sport ke kshetra main yah sab pehali baar dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Gone are the days when Indians remembered the fact that they were going to participate in the Olympics after every four years
 hameshaa se hi yahi kahani rahi haih teen hafte kaa matam, jo sanyogvash padak mil jane se ekaek umang main tabdeel ho jaataa tha, or phir ham agle olympic main bhi vahi kahani dohraane kaa intjaar karte the
 This way of living was good - pleasant and convenient, no matter how dull it may be
 jab aap kisi cheez kii ummid nahin karte hai, to aam taur par kuch haath lag jaataa he
 In this way, by taking a few medals, we used to return quietly to cricket in the name of sports, and life continued as before
 is bich khel prashaskon ke saiyr-sapate vaale daure, bhrashtachar ke scandle, khel sanghon par adhyaksh ke rup main dashakon se kundali markar baithne kii kahaniyaan sunne ko milti rahati thim, jabaki hamaare athleton ke bare main pet paalane ke liye sangharsh karne kii kahaniyaan sunne ko milti thim
 They were asked to stay in unclaimed train coaches instead of hotels, were not provided even basic coaching and were treated like second-class citizens in comparison to cricket superstars
 bharat main olympic khel ek dushchakr main funskar rah gaye the, jahaan athlete kaa naam tabhi charchaa main aata tha jab ve antarrashtriya pratiyogitaaon main koi naatakeey safalataa hasil kar lete the, jo ki bahut mushkil kaam hota tha, kyonki unhen safalataa hasil karne ke liye jaruri suvidhaayen nahin di jaati thim
 But for the last two Olympics, India's long-downtrodden athletes have managed to take matters into their own hands and the situation has changed drastically
 beijing se teen or landan se chah padak lekar lautne ke baad unhone ab tak upeksha kaa bhav rakhane vaale desh kaa dhyaan apni taraf khinchaa he
 In the wrestling hall at the Sports Authority of India (SAI) center in Sonepat, young players have put pictures of Sushil Kumar and Yogeshwar Dutt
 ve kushti ke in dhurandhar khiladinnon kii tasveeron ke saamne abhyaas karte hai taaki unki tarah safalataa hasil kar saken
 His heroes have overcome almost insurmountable odds — ruthless officers, lack of necessary facilities, government apathy, not having a single fan in support
 olympic main aisa kya he, jo ise inasaani uplabdhi kii antim kasuti banaata he
 What is the force that forces a player to compete fiercely to overcome the biggest challenge of the game
 aisa kya he jo olympic ke gaurav ko niraashaa se bhari duniya main ummid kaa pratik bana detaa he
 The answer probably lies in the hypothesis of Pierre de Kubertin, a man of short stature
 paanchaven aadhunik olympic se thik pehle 1912 main france ke is kuleen ke dimag main ek vichaar kaa aavirbhaav hua
 They drew one ring for each of the five continents, knotted them together and painted them with the brightest colors of national flags around the world
 or is tarah se olympic ke mahaan pratik kaa janm ho gaya
 Five rings that symbolize peace and brotherhood
 paanch challe jo dambh se nahin, balki paraspar sammaan ke jariye deshon ko aapas main jodate hai
 Five rings which symbolize appreciation in place of envy in the competition
 kubartin kaa kahana tha ki olympic kaa matlab jeetna yaa haarana nahin he, balki yah dikhaanaa he ki aap kaisaa khele
 And this is where his ultimate challenge lies
 aap kaisaa khele kaa matlab sirf sakvamaan or eemaandaaree ke saath khelnaa bhar nahin he, balki apni puri kshamta ke saath khelnaa he, jisamen aap apni puri takat jhonk den, apni simaaen tod den, or isi ke saath inasaani koshish kii simaaen bhi
 In India, we have never really seen the Olympics from this perspective
 hockey ko chhod den to hamaare paas garv karne ke liye sirf itnaa hi kehane ko hota tha ki ham kuchhek muqablon main jitate-jitate rah gaye, jaise ki 1960 or 1984 main
 Apart from this, there were some mixed mixed surprises in the form of individual performances, such as the performances of Khashaba Jadhav, Leander Paes, Karanam Malleswari and Rajyavardhan Rathore in 1952, 1996, 2000 and 2004 respectively
 lekin hamaari maujuuda athleton kii peedi ne aakhirkaar tasviir badal di he, jisamen olympic gold quest (ojiku) jaisi sansthaaon kaa bhi bharpoor yogadan rahaa he, jinhone pratibhashali khiladinnon ko apni pratibha dikhaane or antat olympic kii vaastavik bhaavana ko khoj nikaalane kaa puraa avasar pradaan kiya he
 Surely India will have a long way to go to become a truly sports nation
 uske liye hamaare samaaj ko khel ko ek samskruti ke taur par apnaane kii jarurat hogi, use apane jivan kaa ek ang bananaa hoga
 We have just taken a very small step, but despite this we have made significant efforts
 india today kanklev 2016 main ol-england badminton champion or bharat ke rashtriya coach pulela gopichand ne bharat ke saamne aane vaali samasya ke mul swabhaav ko ujagar kiya tha
 Gopichand drew a triangle with two equal sides and then drew horizontal lines into three parts of the triangle
 unhone kaha ki neeche kaa sabase bada hissaa un logon kii sankhya he jo bharat main khelon main bhagidaari karte hai
 The middle part indicates the number of people who play the game as a competition
 or teesraa sabase chota hissaa utkrisht athleton kaa he, jo chotii par pahunch gaya he
 He said that to get such a more excellent player, this triangle will need to be made larger so that the smallest part of the triangle can be enlarged proportionally
 yahi ekmaatr tarika he
 The problem has been that the government has not supported anything to promote sports and while facilities are available for the top athletes, who have somehow managed to reach the peak on their own strength, for those players Still no facility is being given to those who are trying to climb up now
 lekin gopichand kaa sateek vishleshan ek swaabhaavik parinaam kii tasviir pesh karata he
 That is, the more our top players perform, the more they are seen competing for medals on TV screens, the more their pictures will be seen in boxing gyms, wrestling bars and shooting ranges across the country, the more More people will be motivated to adopt the game
 or is tarah desh main khel kii buniyaad teji se majboot hogi
 Therefore, Rio 2016 will prove to be the next big step in India's sports journey
 hamaare chuninda khilaadi ab vah sapana dekhne kaa saahas kar rahe hai
 And now the time has come for the rest of us to dream with them too
 isliye hamaare agle kuch panne bataaenge ki hamaare chotii ke athleton ne desh ko ummid kii jhalak dikhaane se kahin zyada kuch karne ke liye kis tarah baadhaon ko paar kiya
 And now the game is waiting to start
 line of control (elosi) ke paas ke ilaakon main hinsa ko lekar america bhi chintit he
 The United States has urged India and Pakistan to engage with the negotiation process to resolve border issues
 videsh mantralay kii pravaktaa jine saki ne kal kaha niyantran rekha se lagate ilaakon main koi bhi hinsa ko lekar ham chintit hai
 We will continue to encourage the governments of India and Pakistan for further talks for the resolution of these issues
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki kashmir par hamaari niti nahin badali he
 We still believe that both the countries, the scope and nature of the dialogue between India and Pakistan on Kashmir have to be decided

 At that time, the matter arose that if Rafael were there, Pakistan's F-16 would not have the courage to penetrate our sky

 When Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi was asked about this dispute, he refused to give any answer and said, this is what to ask? devendra maanjhi, jithan ram maanjhi kii duusari patni kii sabase badi beti ke pati hai
 Devendra said on the criticisms of the opposition that he is a social activist and has been the personal assistant of Jeetan Manjhi since 2006, so why is there any objection after he (jeetan Manjhi) became the Chief Minister

 is din police or suraksha karmiyon ne surendranagar ke dhanki se rajkot jile ke maalia tak sardaar sarovar baandh ke 130 kimi lambey hisse par gasht lagaai taaki kisaanon ko pani churaane se roka ja sake
 Though the water of Narmada is mainly for irrigation, the state government has been forced to keep it as drinking water for the people of Kutch and Saurashtra of North Gujarat
 yah vah ilaaka he jahaan is saal ke ant main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main modi ko tagdi chunauti milane ke asaar hai
 However, it is too late now
 jaisaa ki gujarat ke jal sansaadhan mantri nitin patel kehete hai, ''kareeb ek chauthai monsoon guzar chukaa he or rajya main ab tak sirf 150 mimi barish hui he
 It should have received 800 mm of rain by now
 yadi monsoon jaldi behatar nahin hua to fasalon par iskaa bura asar padegaa
 However, we are ready to deal with any crisis, no matter the problem of drinking water
 ''in dinon rajya ke kareeb 270 gaanvon ko hi tanker se peyajal aapurti kii jarurat padati he
 In the 1990s when the Narmada Canal and Roque Dam were not built, the number of tanker-dependent villages was in the thousands
 rajya main 210 madhyam or chote baandh hai jo is saal keval 33 fisadi hi bhar paae hai
 This is much less than the 50 per cent estimate
 rajya main 70 fisadi buvaai ho chuki he or yadi agast ke pehle hafte tak monsoon gaiyrhaazir rahaa to 30 fisadi fasal suukh jaaegi
 Paddy has not been planted in a large area because there is not enough water for this
 narmada nadi par bana sardaar sarovar baandh gujarat ke liye muktidaata sabit ho saktaa he
 This will help in tackling the potential drinking water crisis, despite 35% less water storage than last year
 sinchai ke morche par samasya zyada gambhir he kyonki rajya ke bade baandhon-sardaar sarovar se lekar maahi par bane kadana or tapi par bane ukai-kaa jalgrahan kshetra (cachament aria) kramshah madhya pradesh, maharashtrr or rajasthan main he or in rajyon main bhi barish bahut kam hui he
 However, there has been some improvement over the past week
 monsoon yadi vifal rahata he to isse chunaav ke pehle shahari-gramin takaraav janm le saktaa he
 There is a murmur of discontent among some farmers in Saurashtra, who were stopped from taking water for irrigation from the Narmada
 yah vipakshi congress or modi ke party main hi virdohi purv mukhyamantri kavshubhai patel ke liye hathiyaar ban gaya he
 He has already described the Modi government as farmers and corporate supporters
 modi ke zyaadaatar pramukh mantri-vajubhai vaala, anandiben patel, nitin patel or saurabh patel-shahari ilaakon se hai
 Without offending the satraps, the government will have to make a balanced distribution of small resources in urban and rural areas
 keshubhai patel purv mukhyamantri suresh mehta or purv kendriya mantri kashiram rana ke saath milakar rajya main 'parivartan' ke binar tale reliyaan kar rahe hai
 On July 22, he described Modi as a "rhinoceros thick skin" in dealing with people's problems
 '' rajkot kii raily main unhone mukhyamantri ko ek 'sada hua fal' bataaya jise phenk dena chahie
 He alleged that Modi is making false claims of development and is 'false'
 modi or unke samarthakon ne abhi tak garimapurna chuppi banaae rakhi he
 But this trio does not want to miss any opportunity to attack the Chief Minister and the drought will give them an easy way out
 lekin nitin patel kehete hai, ''hamen ummid he ki sookhaa nahin aayega
 Even if this happens, it should not be forgotten that by dealing with it effectively, we can get the praise of the public
 ham kisi bhi sthiti se nibatane ke liye taiyaar hai

 Director: Sanjay Gupta Artist: John Abraham, Kangana Ranot, Anil Kapoor, Sonu Sood and Tusshar Kapoor
 diarector sanjay gupta ne aath saal baad dhamaakedaar vaapasi kii he
 He is in front of the audience with a complete entertainer
 film main drama he
 Is action
 romance he
 Is a thrill
 taaliyaan khinchne vaale dialog hai
 Interesting music
 sundar hasinaayen hai or jabardast parformances hai
 The film is a gangster drama and is associated with 1980s Mumbai underworld war and police encounter
 film dongari tu dubai naam kii hossain jaidi kii kitaab par aadhaarit he
 Sanjay Gupta's impression on the film is clear
 kahani main kitna damakhunkharaba or jabadast ection se bharpoor shootout wadala kii kahani bahut tite nahin he
 Manohar (john) is a college student and is implicated in a murder case
 jail main uski mulaakaat shaikh munir (tushaar kapur) se hoti he
 Manohar escapes from jail and forms his own gang in Mumbai
 beshak film kii kahani kitaab se prerit he, lekin is par jabardast masaale kii parat chadha di gai he
 On one side is Manya and her gang, on the other hand there are police officer Anil Kapoor and his people, on the one hand are Manoj Bajpayee and Sonu Sood, who dream of ruling Mumbai
 kahani main kai loop hole hai
 Dialogues also sometimes become overblown
 star apiljon abraham ne manya surve banakar aisa role kiya he jise lambey samay tak yaad rakhaa jayega
 His simplicity as Manohar and Angry Youngman's character as Manya are Kabylatrif
 eemaandaar police adhikari anil kapur, mafia sargana manoj vaajapeyi or sonu sood ne acha kaam kiya he
 In the role that Kangana Ranot has got, she has tried to give her best
 tushaar kapur bhi jame hai
 There are many characters in the film, and many seem to be waved
 agar kirdaar kuch kam hote to bhi film par khaas fark nahin padataa
 John is seen in the film from start to finish
 film puri tarah se jon ke kandhon par he
 John has not previously taken on such a big responsibility
 yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki film ko ve kahaan tak lekar jate hai
 Viewers who love the stories of gangsters will surely like the film
 vaise bhi sanjay gupta kaa sadha hua diarection, jabardast ection or teen-teen item balaayein aisi cheez hai jo film ko ek baar dekhne ke liye majaboor to karti hi hai
 The film is worth the money
 agar aap masala filmon ke shaukeen hai, to yah film aapke liye hi he

 "the letter shown below also contains a detailed Feasibility Report, and states that preparing artificial reefs is an 'acceptable step,' which is seen as a step towards showing responsibility for the environment and boosting the local tourism economy
" 
 yah pehla mauka nahin he, jab nausena kisi yudhpot ko dubo dene par vichaar kar rahi he

 Allahabad is a unique city in Uttar Pradesh in two ways
 isaki bhugolic sthiti ise pradesh ke duusare bade shaharon se alag karti he
 The city is surrounded by rivers on three sides, which restrict the land to live here
 duusari ore elahabaad pradesh kaa sabase adhik jansankhya vaala jila bhi he
 Due to high population and limited land, this city with huge bungalows is now raising its head rapidly and even more rapidly their prices have skyrocketed due to demand for flats
 yahaan sarkari vibhaagon or shiksha ke kshetra main lagaataar ho rahe vistaar kii vajah se baliya se lekar banaras tak faile purvanchal ke jilon se log lagaataar palaayan karke elahabaad pahunch rahe hai

 The area of civil lines has emerged as an important destination for the commercial and residential sector
 viksit infrastracchar hi ise shahar ke anya kshetron se alag karata he
 More than a dozen housing societies have been formed here, including Tulsiani Square, Anant Tower
 mukhya shahar main zyada jameen uplabdh na hone kii vajah se is ilaake kii zyaadaatar imaaraten paanch se chah manjila oonchi hai
 At present, the tallest residential 12-storey building in the city is being constructed in an area of one lakh square feet on Lohia Marg of Civil Lines

 Started in the commercial sector
 1987 main yahaan pehali nau manjila imaarat banakar taiyaar hui
 On the basement and ground floor of this government building, 62 shopkeepers were given shops and the rest were government offices
 1991 main elahabaad vikaas praadhikaran (edie) ne 12 manjila sangam place kaa nirmaan karaayaa, jo is shahar kaa sabase ooncha commercial plaza he
 The private sector has also jumped into building multi-storey commercial complexes

 Was available in, but now their price has reached more than double

 Shivratan Agarwal (63 years) chairman, Bikaji Bhujiaqavi Ashok Vajpayee had said that half of the population of Bikaner is busy making Bhujia, half the population is eating it
 yah baat sach ho yaa nahin, par haa, itnaa jarur he ki kul bhujiyaa utpaadan ke aadhe se zyada hisse par bikaner ke bikaaji group kaa hi aadhipaty he
 Sivaratan Agarwal, Chairman of Bikaji Group has given this traditional business a global identity
 bikaaneri bhujiyaa ke tikhepan or rasagullon kii mithaas ke alahada swaad ko saat samandar paar khaane ke shaukeenon tak pahunchane or use ek khaas pahchaan dilaane kaa kaam shrey bikaaji foods ko hi jaataa he
 Although this journey of Bikaji Group is a long journey of success and achievement in itself, but it was not so easy
 bhujiyaa kaa naam aate hi ek badi-si kaale rang kii kadaahi or lakh safai ke baavjood aasapaas bhinbhinaati hui mackhiyon vaali kisi halwai kii dukaan kii tasviir ubhartee he
 But Bikaji has broken this image
 yun kahen ki food chen ko dikhne main bhi aakarshak banane kii shuruyaat kii he
 Cherishing the dream of doing something different and better in life, just in the 8th pass, Shivratan Aggarwal thought of setting up a Bhujia factory, which is not just a Bhujia factory, but a global identity
 pushton se bhujiyaa kaa hi kaarobaar kar rahe shivaratan ke pita ko shuru main to yakeen hi nahin hua ki bhujiyaa banane kii koi factory bhi ho sakati he
 Bhujia Factory started in 1987 in Bikaner
 do bainkon ne bhujiyaa ke naam par karj dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 Somehow a bank agreed to give a loan
 1993 main paariwarik vyavsaay ke bantwaare ke baad bikaaji brands kaa udai hua
 Sivartan Agarwal says, "it was difficult to get people to work on a coal-fired diesel furnace
 shuru-shuru main to khud dijal kii bhatti jalaana siikhaa or kaam karne waalon ko sikhaaya
 There were many problems too
 ''factory lagane se pehle bhi dimag main yahi khyaal rahata tha ki aise kin desi upkarnon kaa sahaara liya jaae, jisase samay bhi bache, kaam karne vaale ko aasaani ho or adhik maatra main bhujiyaa-papad aadi kaa utpaadan kiya ja sake
 Shivratan wandered with one of his friends, Butter Agarwal, with the ingredients of gram flour, gram flour, etc
 to make some useful tools by giving a demo
 aise upkarnon kii talash main unhone punjab ke raajpura jaise chote shahar bhi khangaal daale
 They would ask the artisans making iron tools to make something that would make this work quicker
 kai baar safalataa milti, kai baar nahin bhi milti
 But now it has become a thing of the past
 bikaaji food company aaj 1,400 karod ru
 Is a company with an annual turnover of Rs 500 crore
 kaa he
 Now, apart from Bhujia, Papad and Rasgulla, the water of Bikaji is available in luxurious packing till the whole
 bikaaji ke yahaan kul 80 food item banate hai
 Shivratan, at the age of 63, still goes to the factory everyday
 bhujiyaa banane vaale se lekar packing karne vaale karmchaaree tak har kisi par unki najar rahati he
 They know everyone privately and call most of the workers by their names
 pita divangat moolchand or maa chuki devi ke chaar beton main se ek shivaratan kaa sara dhyaan isi baat par rahata he ki kis swaad yaa nai takanic kaa upyog kiya jaae, jisase jaayke kii duniya main unki badshahath barkaraar rahe

 2010 main jiographical indication bikaner ke naam hua tha
 Bhujia, once loaded in sacks, was first packed into cartons and sent
 aaj automation packing ke chalate bikaaji ke chamachaate packets paramparaagat food ko aakarshak bana rahe hai
 Today, Bikaji products are exported to about 24 countries in the US, Europe and the Gulf
 anya upaldbridhayon ke saath-saath prati din 50 ton bhujiyaa ke utpaadan kaa record bhi bikaaji ke khate main hi darj he
 Deepak Agarwal, son of Shivratan Agarwal, is also now partnering in the father's business
 2014 main company ne ek nai shrunkhlaa ready tu it or ready tu cook launch kii he, jisamen paramparaagat bhartiya naashte par focus kiya gaya he
 Bikaji Group has also opened its retail outlets where all their products are available
 ab tak mumbai samet desh bhar ke kul 25 shaharon main ye outlet khole ja chuke hai bhavishya ke liye bhi company kii kaaphi mahatvakankshi yojanaayen hai
 Sivaratan says that soon he is going to open Bikaji's outlet in London
 jin deshon main abhi bikaaji ke outlet nahin khule hai, vahaan bhi sambhaavnaaen talaashi ja rahi hai
 Their effort is to bring the company its IPO in the coming years
 bikaner jaise chote shahar main bikaaji group ke sahyog se cardiyak hospital banaaya gaya he
 Apart from this, the company has also signed an mou in February 2015 with the then District Collector Aarti Dogra, under which the construction of toilets in government schools is being done in collaboration with the Bikaji Group
 bikaner teesri aankh kii jad main rahe, iske liye shahar bhar main sisitivi camere lagaae ja rahe hai, jiske liye bikaaji aarthik madad muhaiyaa karvaa rahaa he
 Apart from this, he is also in talks with Chandrakala Padiya, Vice Chancellor of Maharaja Ganga Singh University
 deepak kehete hai, ''kareeb 20 karod ru
 We are ready to support the establishment of a state-of-the-art lab at a cost of Rs
 ''kul milakar yah kahana katai atishyokti nahin hogi ki yah is kaarobaari kii mehnat, junun or karishma hi he ki unhone bhujiyaa jaise nihaayat paramparaagat bikaaneri utpaada ko vaishvik bana diya
 Shivaratan has deep faith in God, but for him work is the first worship
 ve kehete hai, ''main roj mandir to nahin ja paata, lekin main bhairo kaa upaask hum
 i go to the temple once a week
 mere liye ishwar kii upasna kaa arth jaruratmand logon kii madad karnaa bhi he
 "in Bikaner, some people call Shivaratan as the king of Bhujia, and some still call him by his childhood name Fanna Babu due to his cool nature
 bhujiyaa ke badshaah ne shahar ke liye bhamashah kii bhoomika bhi adaa kii he
 Shivratan considers the spirit of continuous dedication, hard work and never giving up as his mantra of success
 ve kehete hai, ''safalataa ke liye yah katai jaruri nahin he ki vyavsaay mahanagar main hi kiya jaae
 i am making Bhujia in Bikaner and selling it all over the world

 Nowadays many people seem upset with their jobs
 vah apni naukari se itnaa pak jate hai ki har samay uski buraai karne lagate hai
 Many times you get to hear such negative things while entering office
 or aapako pataa lagata he ki wo log apni job se kitni nafrat karte hai
 Here we tell you 10 reasons why people are upset with their work in office
 
 
 1
 In many cases, the reason for being upset with the job is bad boss and management
 agar aapaki aapke bos se nahin ban paa rahi he, kaam ko team main baantne kaa tarika bhi aadharahin he, aapke aitraaj nazarandaaj kar die jate hai, to acchhee selary or pasandida job hone ke baavjood bhi kaam ke prati josh khatm hota chalaa jaataa he
 2
 agar job main sthayitv nahin he or aapako hameshaa apni naukari jane kaa dar sataata rahata he to aap offis main kabhi khush nahin rah paaenge
 The feeling of insecurity towards the job gives rise to hatred towards him
 3
 Work in office is decreasing and politics more
 
 
 aise maahaul se bhi aap tang aa jate hai
 4
 kaam bahut zyada he or uske mutabik selary nahin mil rahi he
 Responsibilities have not been given according to the position and salary and you are unnecessarily burdened with workload
 5
 Many people's intermediate bosses do not qualify for that position
 unka taanaashaahee ravaiya or kaam ke prati agyanta se junior pareshaan rahete hai
 In such an environment only negative thoughts come to mind
 6
 Frustration occurs even in the absence of equipment and machines needed for work
 kai baar to bahut baar shikaayat karne ke baavjood jaruri tuls nahin die jate
 7
 offis main aap jo kaam kar rahe hai us field kaa aapako koi bhavishya najar nahin aata, to bhi aap hatotsahit hote hai
 8
 offis kii lalaphitaashahee se bhi bahut se log tang aa jate he
 Your words and you never reach the right person
 tippaniyan 9
 kaam main josh va utsaah ke khatm hone kii sthiti main aap apni naukari se nafrat karne lagate hai

 1
 bahut se cese main job se pareshaan hone kaa kaaran kharaab bos or management hota he
 If you are unable to meet your boss, the way to divide the work in the team is also baseless, your objections are ignored, then despite having a good salary and a favorite job, the passion for work goes on
 2
 If there is no stability in the job and you are always afraid of going to your job then you will never be happy in the office
 job ke prati asuraksha kii bhaavana uske prati nafrat ko janm detii he
 3
 offis main kaam kam ho rahaa he or raajnneeti zyada
 
 
 You get fed up with such environment too
 4
 Work is too much and according to that salary is not available
 pad va vetan ke mutabik jimmedaariyaan nahin di gai he or aap bevajaah kaam ke boj se dabe hue hai
 5
 bahut se logon ke imidiet bos us pad ke kaabil nahin hote
 His dictatorial attitude and ignorance of the work keep the juniors distraught
 aise maahaul main nakaaratmak vichaar hi dimag main aate hai
 6
 kaam ke liye jin sajo-saamaan va mashiinon kii jarurat he, unke na hone kii sthiti main bhi frestrishan hoti he
 Many times, despite complaining many times, the necessary tools are not given
 7
 You are discouraged even if you do not see any future of the field you are working in in the office
 8
 Many people get fed up with the red tape of office
 aapaki baat va aap kabhi sahi shaks tak nahin pahunch pate
 The comments 9
 You end up hating your job in the event of loss of enthusiasm and enthusiasm in work
 10
 Even if you are unable to use your non-working hovers for personal enjoyment, there is a problem of fretting about jobs

 He will also get an opportunity to make necessary improvements in the team
 in sabake bich bhartiya team dakshin africa main apni pehali dwipaksheeya vanade siries jeetne kii koshish karegi
 India's record in Africa: India lost in four bilateral series played in Africa
 usne do baar yahaan tri siries main bhi hissaa liya, jisamen teesri team zimbabwe or kenya thi, lekin tab bhi dakshin africa hi champion bana tha
 India's bad condition in odis as well, series not won in Africa for 25 years, India does not have a good record in bilateral series in South Africa
 ab tak team india ne africa ke khilaaf unki sarajameen par dwipaksheeya vanade siries main kul 20 match khele hai, jisamen se sirf 4 main hi unhen jeet mili he
 Durban's record scares India The first match will be played in Durban where India's record has not been good
 dakshin africa ke khilaaf 1992-93 se is sthaan par bharat ne jo saat match khele hai, unamem se chah main use haar mili, jabaki ek kaa parinaam nahin niklaa

 If India wins the series 4–2, it will rise to the top in place of South Africa

 Virat Kohli's team also maintained the number one ranking in Test matches by continuing their unbeaten campaign at the Wanderers last week
 dakshin africa ne bhale hi test siries 2-1 se jiti, lekin johanisburg main teesraa match usne 63 ran se ganvaaya jahaan kii pich ko isisi match referi ne kharaab qaraar diya
 India did not lose the series since 2016, India's ODI record has also been fantastic
 usne janvari 2016 main australia se 1-4 se siries ganvaane ke baad ek bhi dwipaksheeya siries nahin ganvaai he
 Meanwhile, he defeated Zimbabwe, New Zealand (twice), England, West Indies, Sri Lanka (twice) and Australia
 is dauraan bharat ne dwipaksheeya siries ke 32 main se 24 match jite
 India meanwhile only lost to Pakistan in the final of the Champions Trophy played in England last year
 newjiland cricket sangh ne kaha- IPL main jaanwaron kii tarah ho rahi khilaadiyon kii nilaameebharatiya team acchhee form main he
 Captain Kohli did not play in the limited overs series against Sri Lanka
 isliye middle order main ek yaa do sthanon par faisla karnaa hoga
 Shreyas Iyer, meanwhile, showed good form and hence his side is strong, but here the experience will also be given importance and Dinesh Karthik and Manish Pandey are also in the race for one place
 pich or halatpich bhurabhuri dikh rahi he or durban main barish bhi hui he
 Rain is also predicted tomorrow
 aise main dekhnaa hoga ki bharat kitne spinneron ke saath utarataa he
 If a spinner is included in the playing XI, then Chinaman Kuldeep Yadav could be favored over Akshar Patel and Yuzvendra Chahal to curb left-handed batsmen like David Miller and JP Duminy
 divilliars ne badhaai africa kii chintadakshin africa kii nigaah bhi aagaamee world cap par tiki hai, lekin use pehle teen maichon main abi divilliars ke bina utarana padegaa, jinaki ungali chotil he
 In such a situation, Farhan Behardin was kept in the team, but this time he has not been included in the team
 durban main janmen ballebaaj khayalila jondo apana padaarpan kar sakate hai
 Another option is to open the innings with Hashim Amla and Quinton de Kock and field Aiden Markram in the middle order
 dakshin africa ekmaatr spinner imran taahir ko lekar utar saktaa he

 Most computers have Intel processors
 intel ke alaava AMD or ARM jaise processors bhi computers main hote hai
 There are three major flaws in these processors which can prove to be quite serious
 microsoft ne jaankaree milte hi tatkaal prabhaav se immergency ptch jari kar diya he
 This patch is Windows 7, Windows 8
 1 or Windows 10 oparating systams ke liye jari kiya gaya he
 According to the company, users will also have to update the firmware issued by the device company
 matlab ye he ki windos oparating system ke saath computer nirmaataa dwaara jari kiya gaya formaware bhi apadet karnaa hoga
 Intel, AMD and ARM chipsets are not only in computers but also in other devices such as macbooks and smartphones
 philhal google ne apane divaais ke liye ptch jari kiya he taaki in processors main mili khaamiyon se bachaa ja sake
 At the moment the patch has not been released for macos, Linux, and ios
 kya he khami he isse kya he khatra?do tarah ke atake hai jinhen Meltdown or Spectre kaha ja rahaa he
 Both these attacks are taking advantage of the three shortcomings of the processors, which is a serious situation for the processors of computers
 Meltdown or Spectre persolan computers, mobile or cloud par kaam karte hangoogle security blog main kaha gaya he, ‘ye kamajoriyaan / khamiyaan eemdi, earem or intel or un par chalane vaale oparating system ko prabhavit kar sakate hai’google security blog main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki in khaamiyon kiwajah se yah bhi sambhav he ki koi anadhikrutaparty yaa koi shaks jise aapane computer kaa acces nahin diya he wo aapke system se samvedansheel jaankariyaan hasil kar saktaa he

 Overall, most of the world's smartphones and computers are at risk
 isse bachane ke liye aapako kya karnaa chahie?windows computer yuj karte hai or aapke paas Windows 7, 8
 If it is 1 or 10, then Microsoft has issued a security patch
 aap system settings se ja kar tatkaal prabhaav se ise apadet kar len
 If the computer manufacturer has also released an update, update it as well
 iske liye aap company ke saport main bhi baat kar sakate hai
 Microsoft has issued a statement
 isamen kaha gaya he, ‘ham aaj windos customers kii suraksha ke liye security apadet jari kar rahe hai
 This update will protect customers from problems with Intel, AMD and ARM chipsets
 ’microsoft ne apane ek statement main yah bhi kaha he ki abhi tak company ko aisi koi bhi jaankaree nahin mili he jisase yah pataa chale ki koi bhi windos computer is atake kaa nishaanaa bana he

 Since India imports $ 50 billion more than exports to China
 pichley 3-4 varshon se china kii companiyon ne bharat main nivesh badhanaa bhi shuru kar diya he
 In 2015, Chinese companies plan to invest $ 20 billion in various sectors of India
 china kii kai telecom companiyaan bharat main manuphaccharing ikai laga chuki hai
 In addition, the government has proposals for investment of a dozen Chinese companies at various levels
 vaise mantralay ne ye bhi saafe kiya ki abhi tak china kii companiyon par atirikt nigaraanee kii koi yojana to nahin he, lekin maujuuda rishte or bigadate hai to china se hone vaale nivesh ko lekar atirikt saavdhaanee baratane se bharat parhez nahin karegaa
 Actually, this question is now being asked that if tension is increasing between China and India then why India does not step up financially
 saath hi ye bhi ki kya china ke badhate dabaav ko dekhte hue bharat sarkaar yahaan baari bharkam nivesh karne vaali chini companiyon par nakel kasne kii ranneeti akhriyaar karegi? yaa kya agar donon deshon ke bich koi yuddh jaisi sthiti paidaa hoti he to iskaa asar yahaan nivesh kar chuki chini companiyon par bhi padegaa? The decision on the security clearance of investment of Chinese companies is based on the report of the Union Home Ministry agencies
 vaise do din pehle hi china kii sarkari media ne apni companiyon ko saavdhaan kiya tha ki ve bharat main nivesh karne ko lekar saavdhaan rahen kyonki agar halaat bigadate hai to unke hiton par asar pad saktaa he

 darasal ye sawaal ab poocha jane laga he ki agar china or bharat ke bich tanaav bad rahaa he to bharat kyon aarthik taur par kuch qadam nahin uthta
 Also, given the increasing pressure of China, will the Indian government devise a strategy to clamp down on Chinese companies investing heavily here? Or if a war-like situation arises between the two countries, then it will also affect the Chinese companies that have invested here? chini companiyon ke nivesh ke security clearence par faisalaa kendriya grih mantralay agenciyon kii report ke aadhaar par letaa he
 However, two days ago, the Chinese state media warned their companies to be careful about investing in India because if the situation worsens then their interests could be affected
 tippaniyan China has become one of India's largest trading partners in the last decade and a half
 donon deshon ke bich pichley varsh takreeban 75 arab dollar kaa kaarobaar hua
 However, a large part of this has been in favor of China
 chunki bharat china ko niryaat ke mukaable 50 arab dollar kaa aayaat zyada karata he
 For the last 3-4 years, Chinese companies have also started increasing investment in India
 varsh 2015 main china kii companiyon ne bharat ke vibhinn kshetron main 20 arab dollar kaa nivesh karne kii yojana banaai he
 Many Chinese telecom companies have set up manufacturing units in India

 iske baavjood centre sarkaar ne ab tak koi sarthak pahal nahin kii he jo ki durbhagyapurna he
 He said that Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) President Lalu Prasad Yadav is asking for the Chief Minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar and JDU mlas to get the resignation while the whole matter is with the Central Government

 Taking the combo of 5 stars Javed Jaffrey and Vijay Raj, director Prabhu Raj has produced the film Loot

 Now the film is ready for release
 aaie jaanate hai aakhirkaar kisi bani he yah film
 
 
 The story of the storyfilm starts with businessman Harsh Tandon (javed Jaffrey), who wants to go to the top level in business
 uske parivaar main uskaa betaa sam (rishabh chaddha), patni (niki aneja) or beti tanu (minakshi dikshit) hai
 Sam has a habit of playing prank from time to time
 tanu kaa boyfriend photographer rahul (karan anand) he
 Harsha finds strange people from time to time, due to which his psychiatrist asks him to go on vacation
 harsh apane bivi bacchon or rahul ke saath chuttee ke liye car lekar lakhanu se nainital ravaanaa ho jaataa he
 His car breaks down in the middle
 isaki vajah se ek anjaan musafir vijay raaj unhen apane ghar main raat main rukne ke liye kehete hai
 Then a lot of twists begin in the story and from time to time strange events related to strange ghosts also occur
 kamazor kadiyanfilm kii kamjor kadi isaki dagamagaati hui kahani or screenple he
 The layering of the characters is also messed up
 kahani kaa van liner acha tha
 The part before the interval was also fine
 lekin film kaa second half puri tarah bor karata he
 Finally, the proverb of Khoda Pahar and the Chuhiya proves to be true
 baar-baar hone vaali ghatnaon kaa sir or pair samaj main nahin aata he
 After a moment, boredom also starts

 In a way, it has not been able to make a film that can woo audiences
 abhinay ke lihaaj se bhi har kirdaar lagbhag west hi laga he
 Had the story been good, actors like Javed Jaffrey and Vijay Raj would have also looked great
 casting bhi acchhee nahin hai
 Director Prabhu Raj has tried but the story has weakened him
 kyon dekhen film?film kaa becoground score or do gane achche he
 If you are a fan of Javed Jaffrey or Vijay Raj, then you can definitely try once
 minakshi dikshit kaa kaam bhi acha he
 With the box office promotion, both the budget and budget of the film are quite low
 pehle se hi ayushmaan khurana kii do filmein andhaadhun or badhai ho, box offis par kamaal dikhaa rahi hai, dekhnaa dilachasp hoga kii in sabake bich 'lupt' acha dhandha karti he, yaa 'vilupt' ho jaati he
