 It is true that she fell silent after the Emergency's first injury
 lekin immergency ke pehle or baad isi soi-soi duniya ne aisi angadaai lee thi, jisase sattayen tharthara gai thim
 Just as the country of 1975 was not sure that Indira Gandhi would put an emergency, in the same way, 1971 Indira Gandhi would not have thought that this country would one day rise her crown and fall her plank
 1977 kii jo khamosh kranti hui, usase duniya ke loktantric itihaas kaa ek behtareen drishy bana

 Despite the fact that in these forty years, Hindustan has become a rabbit from the turtle and the media has left behind its daily or weekly rhythm and has become a twenty-four-hour-old mill in which the world keeps grinding and the news is coming out, we a There are more uninformed and vulnerable countries

 In this period, the media is stronger than ever before and the parallel voices are more suppressed than before
 aise samay main deshbhakti kaa matlab duniya main taqatvar hone kii hasarat bhar he, vikaas kaa matlab kuch logon ke liye samruddhi bhar he or netritv kaa matlab aakraamak tevar main kii gai bayaanbazi bhar he

 The middle class who care for everyone, care for the neighborhood, and take care of the country and the world as their own, is over and replaced with an aggressive consumer class who are only ready to eat, drink and wear Thinks and does not allow any kind of violence, irresponsibility and injustice to fall on his skin
 isi daur main media par puunji kaa kabza pehle se kahin zyaada majboot he or samaantar awaazen pehle se zyaada dabi hui hai
 At such a time, patriotism means a desire to be strong in the world, development means prosperity for some people and leadership means a statement made in an aggressive tone

 In an election rally in Assam this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed that no real Indian NRC (NRC) will be left out, but now that the claims and objection process for NRC is over and verification is about to begin, Then a completely different story has emerged in ndtv's investigation
 enditivi ground jiro par pahunchaa or paaya ki abhi bhi tamaam aise log, khaskar aarthik rup se kamzortabake ke hai, jo enarasi ke liye daawa nahin kar paae, kyonki daawa prakriya behad jatil he
 On the other hand, more than 3 lakh objections have been submitted in the last few days on different issues
 aapako bataa den ki 30 july 2018 ko prakashit enarasi kii draft list ke baad daavon or aapattiyon kii samay-seemaa samaapt ho chuki he
 Out of the nearly 40 lakh people left in the draft list, at least 34 lakh people have claimed citizenship, but about 6 lakh people are still left out
 enditivi sarvaadhik daawey or aapattiyon vaale muslim bahul barpeta jile main pahunchaa or paaya ki yahaan kii hakeekat kuch or he
 We met 58-year-old Indra Bhanu Majumdar, who belongs to a poor section and works as a woodcutter
 nau logon ke unke parivaar main, do choti betiyon kaa naam enarasi keedraft list main nahin tha or dobaaraa daawa bhi nahin kar paae
 The reason for this is that whenever he went to the local civil service center for a claim, neither he was allegedly helped nor told what to do next
 indra bhanu majumdaar ke alaava aise tamaam parivaar hai, jinaki kamobesh yahi kahani he
 Now the fate of their fate is to be decided by the Supreme Court, which is monitoring the NRC
 aapako bataa den ki beete teen dinon main ai kareeb 3 lakh aapattiyon main se 1 lakh ke aasapaas aapattiyaan akele barpeta jile kii hi hai
 Let us tell you that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured the people of Assam's Barak Valley that no name will be separated from NRC
 unhone kaha, "main aapako bharosa dilaataa hum ki bharat ke kisi naagarik kaa naam enarasi main nahin chhutegaa"
 PM Modi said, "I know that many people have suffered in the process of updating NRC
 mujhe isaki jaankaree he, lekin yah aapkaa tyaag he ki prakiya safal hui he
 We appealed to the Supreme Court to accept some documents such as relief certificates, refugee camp certificates as valid certificates of those claiming citizenship
 mujhe prasannataa he ki sarvocch nyaayalay isse sahamat hua"
 Lander Vikram lost contact with ISRO just two kilometers before the lunar surface
 par isro kaa chandramaa par pahunchane kaa hausala nahin tutaa
 ISRO has created many histories in the world of space
 aaj isro ne apni pahchaan desh- duniya main bana lee he
 The credit goes to Vikram Sarabhai
 jinaki vajah se isro kii sthapana hui or bharat ne antariksh vigyaan main itani tarakkee karke bade-bade abhiyaanon main safalataa praapt kii he

 haal ke dinon main dilli police kii special cell or krime branch jaisi ikaayiyon ne aise kai gan rackets kaa pardaafaash kiya he, jo hai quality ke sofisticdet hathiyaaron kaa dhandha karte the
 The reality is that the policemen were also shocked to see the quality of these weapons for the first time
 police kii maane to ye aslhe kisi bhi myne main factriyon main bane proper hathiyaaron se kam nahin hai, bas kami he, to sarkari factory kii muhar kii
 Experts should be able to see and cheat
 Seeing the illegal weapons captured by the police, at first glance any expert may be deceived
 mumkin he ki use bhi in hathiyaaron ke factory maid hone kii galatarahami ho jaae
 These illegitimate slaves are not stolen from any gun factory nor are they made in any big factory, but the arms smugglers have prepared them on their own small bases to use in the world of crime
 munhmaangi keemat par bikate hai hathiyaarathiyaaron kii shandaar quality ye sabit karti he ki badalte vakt ke saath ye dhandhebaaz naa sirf or peshewar ho gaye hai, balki acchhee quality kaa maal dekar graahakon se bhi munhmaangi qeemat vasuul karne lage hai
 Near businessmen
 32 kii pistal, 9 mem kii pistal or 
 Where a 30 bore pistol is available for 20 to 25 thousand rupees
 32 bor kii revolver 18 se 25 hazaar rupye main or 12 bor kii gan 40 se 50 hazaar rupye main mil jaati he
 Arms police sources coming from Madhya Pradesh also believe that after the closure of some government gun factories, the unemployed people have started making illegal weapons
 yahi vajah he ki ab bihar ke munger kii jagah madhya pradesh ke kai thikaanon se aise aslhon kii aamad shuru ho gai he
 Therefore, to stop this business, not only arrest but rehabilitation of the old artisans of the slums has become necessary
 gangsters main badha aise hathiyaaron kaa chalanaye dhandha beshak gaiyrkanoonee ho, lekin kisi bhi duusare dhandhe ke tarah najayas aslhon kaa ye kaarobaar bhi maang or purti kii ganit par hi tikaa he
 According to experts, in recent times the craze for such sophisticated type of weapons has increased in Delhi and nearby gangsters and due to this, these businessmen are also getting a lot of profit
 haalat ye ho gai he ki ab bichauliyon ne baqayada hathiyaar banane waalon ko work order tak dena shuru kar diya he
 Illegal weapons business means low cost and high profit
 anderworld kii duniya se jude is kaale dhandhe main lage girohon kii chaandi he
 Smugglers sell weapons directly to the gang This black business is flourishing especially with the connivance of arms dealers
 avaidh hathiyaar or manamaani keemat
 Nevertheless, there is a line of buyers in the market of goods
 avaidh hathiyaaron kii taskari main lage giroh aise hi kisi ke haath main hathiyaar nahin bech dete
 They are the agents
 jo dilli ke aparaadhiyon ko hathiyaaron kii supplai karte hai, jab jaisi jarurat hoti he, jis tarah kii jarurat hoti he, vaise hi hathiyaaron kii taskari kii jaati he
 Smugglers are less likely to be caught selling weapons directly to the gang
 avaidh hathiyaaron kaa garh ban rahi he dilhihaal ke dinon main dilli main jis tezi se hathiyaar or hathiyaaron ke saudagaar pakade gaye hai, usne sabit kar diya he ki dilli ab khatarnaak taskaron ke liye ek pasandida transit root ban chukaa he
 But the question is, what is the matter in Delhi, the capital of the country, that despite all the vigilance of the police, the arms traffickers find a way to conserve their goods from here? So the experts also have the answer to this question
 darasal, dilli bhugolic taur par ek aisa rajya he, jo uttar pradesh or haryana jaise rajyon se ghira to he hi saath hi rajasthan, uttarakhand jaise rajya bhi yahaan se zyaada dur nahin hai
 Due to the densely populated and many modes of transport, smugglers easily live here to save their goods
 inhen baton ne dilli ko ek bade arms transit root main tabdeel kar diya he
 Whenever the Delhi Police catches a gang, it displays an exhibition of weapons recovered from it
 lekin jitne hathiyaar police ke haath lagate hai, usase kahin zyada hathiyaar aparaadhiyon tak pahunch jate hai
 The capital of millions of arms caught in a few years is now becoming the favorite place of arms dealers
 haal ke chand saalon main dilli police ne yahaan se jitne dhandhebaazon or hathiyaaron kii khep baraamad kii he, wo aankada apane aap main dilli kaa nayaa sach bayaan karata he
 No need to go too far
 saal 2011 main dilli police ne 561 gaiyr kanoonee hathiyaaron ke saath takreeban 150 logon ko giraftaar kiya tha, 2012 main 562 hathiyaaron ke saath kul 1190 taskar dhar daboche gaye
 Whereas in 2013, the police uncovered a total of six gangs with 309 illegal pistols
 madhyapradesh ke hathiyaar bane chunautiaankade to puri dilli police ke hai, pichley do saalon se najayas aslhon ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaa rahi dilli police kii ikai special cell ne jahaan akele pichley saal 196 aslhon ke saath 33 badmaashon ko giraftaar kiya tha
 But there is no shortage of data
 police kii maane to pehle dilli main lut or katl kii zyaadaatar vaardaaton main munger se laae gaye hathiyaaron kaa hi istemaal kiya jaataa tha, lekin ab munger kii jagah madhyapradesh ke hathiyaar ne le lee he
 The smugglers there have re-emphasized the police tactics
 darasal, madhya pradesh se aane vaale ye hathiyaar bihar ke munger bane hathiyaaron ke mukaable quality main bahut hi umdaa or khubasurat kism ke hai or in hathiyaaron kii yahi khaasiyat badmaashon ko lubhaane lagi he
 The changing trend of illegitimate businesses is a big problem for the police, but everyday new players coming into this business are proving to be a headache for the police

 Newly appointed Law Minister Kapil Sibal said that it would be his endeavor that the legal process does not impede economic development and the appointment of judges should be done through a transparent process

 He said that he will try to ensure that the legal process should not become an impediment to economic development, rather it should increase its speed
 tippaniyan Sibal, who took over as the fourth law minister during the four-year tenure of UPA-II, said that simplification and transparency of legal processes is necessary to achieve this objective
 unke bayaan kaa mahatv he kyonki kuch karadhaan kanoonon ko lekar sarkaar british doorsanchaar company vodaphone ke saath kanoonee ladaai main uljhi hui he
 This is seen by some as a discouraging effect on the sentiments of foreign investors

 teen saal pehle jo dar bagdadi ke aatankiyon kii vajah se mosul ke logon main tha
 See the nature of God that today, due to Iraqi troops in the same Mosul, it is now visible in the eyes of the terrorists
 shaayad aise hi ghumta he vaqt kaa pahiyaa
 That is why the Iraqi military is taking revenge from the ISIS terrorists just as they did against the innocents
 vaise hi unhen gharon se girebaan pakadakar khasita ja rahaa he
 Similarly, they are being covered from height
 vaise hi un par bandook tani ja rahi he or aage kii kahani to aap samaj hi gaye honge
 How could i have thought that the actions of these people would not be accounted for
 pakade jaaenge to inke saath wo saluk naa hoga jo inhone begunaahon ke saath kiya
 How did these terrorists think that the way they threw people from the hills, they will not be thrown
 jis tarah inhone berahami se masuumon ko peeta inhen na peeta jayega
 How did you think that they will not be taken out of homes? inke upar bandooken tani nahin jaaegi
 They will not be intimidated
 inkaa khun bahaya nahin jayega
 How did you think that they will not be killed by sticks? girebaan pakadakar khasita nahin jayega
 How did you think that they would not be brought to the banks of the same river in which innocent Kogoli were beaten 3 years ago
 or inhen uske kinare laakar goli nahin maari jaaegi
 As much punishment as possible, there will be hardly any kind of terror since the world came into existence, which has so humiliated humanity
 lihaaza sazaa jitani bhi inhen di jaae, wo kam he
 But still they may not understand the pain they have given to the innocent and innocent
 isliye jaise hi ye iraqi fouj ke kabze main aae sainikon ne inase iraqi logon par kiye gaye zulm kaa gin-gin ke badla liya
 This is the same revenge video that has now surfaced to the world through social media
 kareeb ek minute 45 second ke is video kii shuruuaat gharon main chupe aatankiyon ko baahar nikaalane ke oparation se hoti he
 And once apprehended, angry Iraqi soldiers do this for the sake of them
 narsanhaar kii gavaah he ye chattangirebaan pakadakar inhen inke thikaanon se baahar nikaala jaataa he
 And then they are dragged to the edge of the rock
 ye vahi jagah he jahaan teen saal pehle iesas ne saikadon logon ko ek saath sir main goli markar narsanhaar kiya tha
 Pictures show that Iraqi soldiers rolled the terrorists after bringing them to a high and steep cliff
 kareeb 30 feet kii oonchai se aatankiyon ko neeche phenkane ke baad unhen goliyon se bhun diya gaya
 Look at the hill from which this terrorist is being brought down to throw the dead body of another terrorist already there
 ye aatanki bhi apane saathi ke upar girtaa he
 And then it is also fired in the same way as these people had showered on innocents
 gharon main chupe hai ISIS aatankijis jagah aatankiyon ko unke kiye kii sazaa di ja rahi he, vahaan kaiatankiyon ko pakadakararkha gaya he
 All these terrorists were hiding in the houses and firing on the army and common people
 is clip ko mosul ai ne apane twitor acount par saajha kiya he
 In the past, news and information related to the war in Mosul have been posted through this Twitter account
 iraqi fouj ke joint oparation cmand ke pravaktaa ne bataaya ki sena or sarkaar is video kii jaanch kar rahi he
 However, it has not been confirmed yet whether this video is correct or not
 sena ne saaf kiya he ki sainya karrwai ke dauraan maanavadhikaar kaa ulanghan karne waalon ke khilaaf karrwai hogi
 Last week, the Iraqi government declared victory in Mosul
 aatankiyon kii talash jarihalanki iraqi pradhanmantri ne ye bhi saaf kiya tha ki mosul main abhi bhi iesas ke kuch aatankiyon ne logon ke gharon main jabaran panaah le rakhi he
 Whose search is going on aise main soshal media par jari hue is video ko usee se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 However, military officials say that this video can also be fake because some people are trying to reduce the happiness and confidence gained by this victory
 or shaayad ye video bhi aisi hi kisi koshish kaa hissaa ho
 However, Human Rights Watch has confirmed the location of this video with the help of satellite
 jiske baad iraqi fouj par maanavadhikaar kaa ulanghan karaane kaa aarope laga
 The military campaign that started in October 2016, tell you that in October 2016, the Iraqi army started a military operation to liberate Mosul from the possession of terrorists
 or 9 maheenon tak chali is behad bheeshan ladaai main jeet hasil karne ke baad sainikon kaa manobal kaaphi ooncha he
 They are obviously very happy and are celebrating this happiness in different ways
 mosul ne to aatank se azaadi kii aas hi chhod di thi magar bagdadi par iraqi senaaon ke yalgaar kii vajah se aaj use apane upar hue zulmon kaa hisaab lene kaa mauka mila he
 And believe me, the people of Mosul are full of terrorists and taking account of their crime and their pain
 ghaseet-ghasitkar aatankiyon ko mosul ke gali-kunchon main phiraaya ja rahaa he
 People are firing on the terrorists with a kick, some with punches
 or jise kuch nahin mil rahaa he
 He is spitting out his anger by spitting in their face
 usee quran or rasul kii haddees he ki insaan ke kukarmon kaa hisaab usase isi duniya main liya jaataa he
 Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi, the world's most dreaded terrorist, declared himself the Khalifa, citing the Quran and Rasool
 or phir usee quran or rasul kii hidaayaton ko darkinar kar islam ke naam par haivaaniyat failaai
 Now the calculation of that havoc has started
 or jis dardanaak maut kii misaalen duniya main di jaati hai
 Baghdadi operatives are being killed in the same manner
 magar in darindon ko jitani bhi bhayanak maut di jaae utani kam he
 i refused to accept Baghdadi as Khalifa
 Of course this death is painful, but you will find it very easy when you see the deaths that the terrorists of Baghdadi have shared among the innocent and innocent without mercy
 inamen koi yazidi tha
 Someone was a Christian
 koi shiya to koi sunni tha
 There were many who refused to consider Baghdadi as the Caliph
 bagdadi ne in logon ko aisi maut di jiskaa taarikh main bhi koi zikr nahin miltaa
 But each crime is accounted for by the same criminals
 jiskaa naam lekar ye adharmee mazahab ke naam par begunaahon ko maarthe hai
 People are not taking this revenge on terror in Mosul, Iraq only with the intention of revenge
 balki ek ek laat or ek-ek ghunsa ye log apane saath gujri haivaaniyat kaa zikr karte hue maar rahe hai
 They are taking every wound, someone is saying that you killed my father, someone is saying that you have robbed my sister
 koi kah rahaa he ki tumne meraa ghar ujaada to koi kah rahaa he ki tumne meri zindagi barbaad kar di
 You destroyed my good and good country with gunpowder
 or badale kaa ye mauka inhen badi minnaton or intazaar ke baad mila he
 Therefore, all of them want to do all their work
 in bebason or besahaara logon ko ye mauka iraqi senaaon ne mahaz 2 saal main de diya he
 Otherwise, he gave up hope of freedom from terror
 or ab jab mauka mila to mosul ke in logon ne ji bhar ke badla liya
 These savage poor people of Baghdadi were driven across the city by carriages
 aatankiyon ko gali-gali ghuma rahi senaatankiyon ko baandhakar ghaseetne vaali gaadiyaan mosul ke har mohalle main ja-jaakar ruuk rahi he
 And people are taking out their anger by killing them
 jo bahut zyada gusse main hai wo aatankiyon ko gaadi se ghaseet le rahe hai or maarthe hue galiyon main ghuma rahe hai
 This anger of the people of Mosul is telling how Baghdadi, the boss of terror, had shown them bombs and guns, forcing them to live in suffocation
 jaise-jaise iraqi senaayen mosul ke andar ghusati ja rahi hai, vaise-vaise aatankiyon par shikanja kasata ja rahaa he
 Iraqi forces are trying to capture these terrorists and put them in jail, but the influx of Iraqi forces has increased the enthusiasm of the people and they are taking revenge on the terrorists themselves
 iraqi senaaon ke kabze main aane ke baad in aatankiyon kii haalat dekhne laayak he
 Fearfully, these terrorists forgetting their ruthlessness and pleading with them

 gujarat main congress or patidaar netaaon main pichley kuch dinon se jo ‘khichdi’ pak rahi thi, wo ab jalati hui najar aa rahi he
 Since the announcement of the Gujarat elections, the Congress has been trying to bring Patidar leader Hardik Patel into its fold
 kai baar baatcheet kii koshish hui, lekin koi nateeja nahin niklaa
 Hardik's ultimatum also did not work
 ab uhapoh ke bich congress ne apane ummidavaaron kii pehali list jari kii to donon pakshon main sir-phutowwal kii naubat aa gai
 Workers from both sides clashed in Surat, Ahmedabad and Rajkot
 ab rajkot main hardik patel kii raily phir se radd kar di gai he
 Earlier on November 18, the Hardik Patel rally in Gandhinagar was canceled
 isse pehle ki patidaar or congress milakar bijepi ke khilaaf gujarat main laden, aapas main hi sir phutowwal kar liya
 Congress leader Praful Togadia's office in Surat was vandalized
 isi tarah ahmedabad main bharat singh solanki ke daftar ke baahar bhi patidaar or congress kaaryakartaaon ne ek duusare par jamkar shakti pradarshan kiya
 The special thing is that a few hours before the fight, the Congress leaders had made it clear that the Patidar leaders had come with them
 lihaaja ab 77 ummidavaaron kii pehali list jari kii ja rahi he
 However, Gujarat Congress President Bharat Singh Solanki has claimed that the list released by the party had a formula to beat the Patidars with caste equations
 pehali list main congress ne apane maujuuda 14 vidhayakon ko tikat diya he
 At the same time, 3 leaders of the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti have been given tickets
 iske alaava 20 patidaaron ko, 6 dalit or 8 obisi ko tikat diya gaya he
 Actually, the Patidars say that the Congress did not talk to them before issuing the ticket and announced the list
 hardik patel vaale patidaar kah rahe hai ki jin teen netaaon ko congress ne anukanpa ke aadhaar par tikat diya he, wo nomination hi nahin file karenge
 Now the screw is trapped in a tremendous way, because on one side there are the Patidars whom the Congress distributed 20 tickets to support
 duusari taraf hardik patel vaale patidaar hai, jinhen sirf teen siten milin
 Today, due to the cancellation of Hardik Patel's rally in Rajkot at the last moment, it is believed that something is wrong
 mana ja rahaa tha ki isi raily main tay hona tha ki patidaar congress ke saath rahenge yaa khilaaf rahenge
 Now the situation is also difficult for the Congress, because it wants to taste the victory over the Patidars
 unamem khud main dophaad ho gaya he
 So far Hardikpatel has not opened the leaves
 aise main gujarat chunaav main suspence ke saath-saath jabardast jang bhi he

 007
 zaraa sochie ek hi shahar ke saat alag-alag ilaakon main ek shaks ghumta he alag-alag naam or alag-alag cheharaa liye
 After that he likes seven girls in those seven areas
 phir ek-ek kar un saaton se wo shaadiyaan karata he
 And the amazing thing is that despite having seven wives in the same city, no wife ever doubted him
 ab uski najar aathven ilaake or aathvin shaadi par thi
 But then there was a mess
 kahin wo syed hota
 Shahzad somewhere
 kahin ali ban jaataa to kahin sahil
 Person one, but face different
 or un nae chehron ko saath har baar naam bhi bilkul nayaa
 No one ever came to know when and how he would change his style
 is bahuroopie kaa khel hi aisa tha ki har koi dhokhaa khaataa gaya
 But once its reality opened, then every area of the city recognized it
 asli naam--- shahzadaumr---35 salshauq---shaadiyaan karnaais dhokheybaaj kaa ajeeb shauk tha
 Creating a wife in every area of the city
 or apane isi shauk ko puraa karne ke liye ye shahar ke alag-alag ilaakon main alag-alag naam or chehre ke saath ghumta rahaa
 After visiting seven areas, it performed seven marriages with seven names
 par isaki badanasibi ye thi ki saatvin bivi zaraa hoshithar nikali
 There was some doubt on the antics of the groom Mian
 phir kya tha
 Before reading the Nikah for the eighth time in the eighth area, he could get his eighth wife
 
 
 
 
 pole khul gai
 And since then these groom mian have been missing
 ab is baar koun sa nayaa cheharaa yaa nayaa naam liye kisi ko pataa nahin
 Just think
 jahaan kaiyon ke liye ek shaadi karnaa mushkil sabit ho rahaa he vahaan 10 saal main hi isane 7 shaadiyaan kar daaleen
 Now since the reality of the groom mian has come to the fore, the Bhopal police has also decided that whosoever has a doli or wedding procession, will definitely find it where the wedding takes place
 kya pataa sehre ke peeche se phir yahi nikal aae
 Bhopal police because this groom has fed all the flowers in Bhopal itself
 saat biviyaan or kisi ko us shaq nahin
 
 
 Actually Syed alias Shahzad alias Ali alias Sahil had married seven different girls in seven different areas of the city while living in Bhopal city
 or kamaal ye dekhie ki ek hi shahar main saat biviyon ke hote hue bhi kabhi kisi bivi ko usapar shaq tak nahin hua
 Well the funny thing is that the brother has done seven marriages, this seventh wife is also telling because he has only the evidence of seven wives
 duulhe miyaan kii aadat ko dekhte hue agar ye aankaad saat ke paar chalaa jaae to bhi hairaani nahin honi chahie
 And the more amazing thing is that even now no one knows who is this person? What does it do
 
 Where does it come from 
 Where are you from? This serial groom of weddings is very likely hiding in your city or in your locality with a new name and new face
 to bas hoshithar rahiega
 And if you have any doubt, please inform the police immediately
 
 
 taaki ek baar inhen asli sasuraal to pahunchaaya jaae
 Probably, he used to roam around in Bhopal, doing weddings
 par is shaatir duulhe kii saatvin bivi hoshiyaar nikali
 Then the distinction of this groom 007 could be revealed
 par bhed khulne ke baad bhi uskaa cheharaa ab bhi dhakaa he
 This is the reason why he does not feel the hands of police
 haalanki uski fitrat ko dekhte hue saatvin bivi ko puraa yakeen he ki ab tak wo aathvin shaadi bhi nipta chukaa hoga
 The zine of Bhopal became the seventh bride of this vicious groom
 saal bhar pehle 11 janvari 2013 ko zeenat ne uske saath nikaah kiya tha
 Here is that Nikahnama
 ab ye nikaahnamaa asli he yaa farzi he ye ham aapako bataaen usase pehle zaraa ye ikraarnama dekhie
 Who belongs to that wife with another wife
 lekin ye kissa yaheen tak mahadood nahin he biviyon auki unke saath dhokhe kii daastaan bahut lambii he
 
 
 According to Zeenat, Syed gave his name to most of his wives as Shahzad
 shuruaati tafteesh ke baad ye baat sabit hui ki uskaa asli naam vaaki shahzad hi he
 But the name Zeenat fell in love with a year ago is now hated by that name
 
 
 kyonki isaki vajah se zeenat kii zindagi barbaad ho gai
 
 
 But Zeenat is not alone Shehzad has ruined her life by implicating 6 more girls in the trap of her false love
 bhopal ke farhat abza main rahane vaali zeenat kii mulaakaat is shaatir duulhaa se tab hui jab wo padhai ke liye institute jaaya karti thi
 Shehzad used to follow him two years ago
 zeenat ke mutabik use is baat kaa zaraa bhi ilm nahin hua ki shahzad kii bholi bhali shakl ke peeche ek shaatir aawaara chipa hua he
 Whose job is to trap innocent girls in the trap of their love and marry them
 or jab uskaa dil unase bhar jaataa to wo unhen chhod kar gaayab ho jaataa
 Zeenat and his family were also caught in the same innocent words of Shahzad
 
 
 acchhee acchhee baaten kar ke or sapane dikhaa ke usne in sab kaa dil jeet liya
 And then married Zeenat
 
 
 raaj to tab khulaa jab zeenat ne ghar main rakhi ek file kaa panna kholaa
 The groom Mian's old handiwork was closed in that file
 asaliyat jaanane ke baad zeenat ne jab iskaa virodh kiya to isane use maarna peetna shuru kar diya
 
 phir dhamkiyaan dene laga ki jaise tumse pehle main 6 shaadiyaan kar chukaa hum tumhaare baad 8ve shaadi bhi kar saktaa hum
 According to Zeenat, now Shahzad may be with his eighth wife
 
 However, it is not known whether she is married eighth or not
 lekin zeenat ko puraa yakeen he ki wo abhi bhi bhopal main hi chupa he
 But the question is why he is not caught even while living in Bhopal
 pehle kii chah bividhon yaa unke ghar vaale kabhi use talash kyon nahin kar paae? to isaki bhi kahani he
 The thing in itself is astonishing that how can one do so many marriages in the same city? She is also such that if no one gets ear to ear from first to seventh wife, then the seventh wife opened this secret of the groom
 darasal duulhaa miyaan sehara baandhne se pehle hameshaa cheharaa badal liya karte the
 Because he has mastery in changing face
 kabhi apni tasviir nahin khinchvaata tha ye dulhasat-saat shaadiyaan karne vaala ye duulhaa 007 itnaa shaatir he ki kabhi ye apni tasviir nahin khinchvaata
 So that it does not get caught
 ye tasviir bhi bas saatvin bivi zanit kii vajah se saamne aa saki
 Actually, this groom, who specializes in changing the hulia, knew that after so many marriages living in the same city, photographs can open his pole
 isliye wo hameshaa bahaane bana kar tasviren khinchvaane se bachataa rahaa
 And really this is his skill for so long
 haalanki ab pole khulne ke baad pehali baar bhopal police main uske khilaaf maamla darj hua he
 On Zeenat's complaint, the police registered a dowry and fraud case against Shehzad
 
 
 jagah-jagah dabish dane shuru kar di he
 But the groom Mian is not yet engaged to the police
 vaise is duulhe tak pahunchane main police ko jo sabase badi dikkat aa rahi he wo ye ki police ko pataa hi nihan he ki philhal wo kis rup main or kis naam se shahar main gum rahaa he
 What will her new face be like at the moment? But the face of this groom 007 can be something like this
 isliye aap sabase phir kahuunga ki agar aapako gaye cheharaa kahin dikhaai de to fouran police ko ittila kiijie
 Any other bride's life will be saved from ruin

 5 to 1 6 karod euro kaa praavdhaan karne ke liye kaha tha
 Also, there was talk of keeping 3 million euros separately for 'AP'
 mishael ne ye saaf nahin kiya tha ki parivaar koun he or ‘ap’koun he
 Whether or not the 'AP' mentioned by Michelle in the diaries is about Ahmed Patel, it remains unclear and unconfirmed

 32000 ton pyaaj sadane or ghotaale kaa laga aropajawab na milane par CBI jaanch kii karenge maang- sanjay singh32000 ton pyaaj sadane or usamen ghotaale kaa aarope lagaate hue aam aadmi party sanjay singh ne kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ko patr likhaa he
 He says that it should be investigated
 saath hi unka kahana he ki agar ramvilas paswan ne patr kaa jawaab nahin diya to court kaa darwaja khatkhataya jayega
 What happened in the case of onion rot? Aam Aadmi Party mps Sanjay Singh, Sushil Gupta and ND Gupta say that Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan himself has said in the Lok Sabha that 32000 tonnes of onions have been rotting
 pyaaj sadane ko lekar kya karrwai kii gai? saath hi isko lekar kya kisi adhikari ke khilaaf karrwai kii gai yaa sirf kaagajon main ye mudda padaa he
 This is a scam
 jab pyaaj unke paas itnaa zyada padaa hua tha to aakhir ise rajyon or janata ko saste daamon main kyon nahin diya gaya
 Sanjay Singh says, 'onion has become a serious crisis in the whole country today
 janata pyaaj kii mahangaai se ro rahi he or sansad ke andar desh kii loksabhaa main mantri ji ne jo bayaan diya he vah bahut hairaan karne vaala he
 Ram Vilas Paswan, who has given a statement in the Lok Sabha, which has been shown by the media, has also told that 32000 tonnes of onions were rotting
 'sanjay singh ne uthaae sawalsanjay singh ne sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki sarkari godaamon main 32000 ton pyaaj sad gaya uskaa kya pramaan he? kya wo register main darj kii gai? kyasarkaar ke paas bhandaaran kii vyavastanahin he? agar 32000 ton pyaaj sad gaya to jaahir he ki pyaaj to 1 din main nahin sada hoga
 This onion must have taken several days to rot
 agar pyaaj sadana shuru hua tha to aapane saste daamon main rajyon ko kyon nahin diya
 Also, why was the onion not given to the public at cheap prices
 aage unhone kaha ki kya is desh kii sarkaar ko pyaaj sadana manjuur he lekin garib aadmi kii thali main pahunchaana manjuur nahin
 Is the government of this country not allowed to sell onions at cheap prices, but it is allowed to rot, then this is a big question
 ramvilas paswan ko likhi chitthisanjay singh kaa kahana he ki ramvilas paswan ko ek chitthee bhi likhi he
 Have asked some questions to him
 vahiin dilli sarkaar ko 5 sitambar ko ek patr likhaa gaya he ramvilas paswan ke mantralay ko likhe gaye is khat main kaha gaya he ki 56 hajaar metric ton pyaaj centre sarkaar ke paas uplabdh he jitna pyaaj le sakate hai
 We have demanded from them that onions should be sent to us by December 9, but the government today sent 23 trucks of onions daily and suddenly stopped the supply of onions
 aakhir pyaaj kahaan gaya?saath hi unhone sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki dilli sarkaar ko pyaaj kyon nahin diya gaya
 We have also asked the Minister on this, what is really rotten
 kaagajon main isko sada dikhaa diya gaya or isamen koi bada ghotaalaa kiya gaya
 He said that we have also asked the question that if 32000 tonnes of onion has been rotated, has any officer taken action on this
 sarkaar ne koi kadam uthaaya
 Was any action taken on this? yah sarkaar kii galat nitiyon ke kaaran hua he
 He also said that this has arisen due to the onion scam, so we have written a letter to the minister and asked him for an answer
 agar vah jawaab nahin denge to sibiai jaanch ke liye puure maamle kii jaanch ke liye court main bhi jaaenge
 If the answer is not found after writing this letter, then we will take further action on it

 dilli main model kii khudakushi ne sabhi ko hilaakar rakh diya he
 She was a successful event manager, named Priyanka
 bhalaa kii khubasurat or utani hi dilkash
 That's when a businessman comes into his life
 baat mohabbat se shuru hoti he or phir chah maheene main hi donon shaadi bhi kar lete hai
 But just a month after marriage, Priyanka feels that getting married was the biggest mistake of her life
 bas is galati ko durust karne ke liye wo apni jindagi kaa aakhri or sabase khatarnaak kadam uthaati he
 Within a month, marriage had become a burden, due to her hard work and dedication, Priyanka started seeing a good name in the world of event management
 apni inhen khoobiyon kii badaulat wo glamer kii duniya par bhi chaa janaa chaahati thi lekin isse pehle ki aisa mumkin hota, uski jindagi main mohabbat ne dastak di
 Fakat was married to a six-month-long love affair, but after just a month, this marriage became such a story for him that he himself put a fullstop on the story of his life with his own hands
 priyanka ke suicide note main puri kahanimrane se pehle priyanka ne suicide note likhaa
 In it he wrote, "I know what gum is
 mujhe khushiyon kaa bhi andaja he
 i know very well what is sadness and emotion
 magar mere pati ne mujhe puri tarah majaboor kar diya
 Nitin has a rape case registered in Mumbai
 mujhe pataa hi nahin tha ki wo mere saath itnaa bura suluk karegaa
 He is the only person who scares me
 shaadi ke ek maheene baad hi usne apni shaitani surat dikhaai or mujhe jaanwaron kii tarah peeta
 And when i wanted to tell my family people everything, it hit me more
 maine nitin se sirf isliye hi shaadi kii thi kyonki usne mujhase apane pyaar kaa izhaar kiya tha or mujhe yakeen dilaayaa tha ki wo mujhe beintehaa pyaar karata he or wo hameshaa mujhase pyaar karata rahegaa
 But that has changed because now that same person asks me to leave the house
 keval nitin ke saath rahane ke liye hi maine apni maa se taalluk khatm kar die
 They are very selfish
 sochaa tha jindagi main mohabbat milegi, lekin dard mila
 Nitin's mother says that she did nothing wrong
 teen raaton se nitin ghar nahin aayaa or usne mujhe Watsapp par massej bheja ki main ghar khaali kar duun
 So now i have no other way left
 "pehali najar kaa pyarpriyanka jitani khubasurat or jindadil thi, apane kaam ke maamle main hi utani hi mehnatee bhi
 To get to know the glamorous world of glamor and show-business closely, she started the work of event management and was also growing rapidly
 lekin ab se koi aath maheene pehle uski jindagi main tab sabase bada mode aayaa, jab ek event argenise karwaane ke silsile main uski mulaakaat dilli ke restro-bijnesaman nitin chawla se hui
 Nitin had come to Priyanka's office in Lajpat Nagar to give his work contract, but Haseen was able to give his heart to Priyanka
 iske baad pehle mahange pregents kaa silsilaa shuru hua or phir dekhte hi dekhte donon kii ye mulaakaat pyaar main tabdeel ho gai
 Nitinlekin was already married, but Priyanka first felt something strange in her and Nitin's relationship, when she came to know that Nitin is already married and has two children including a ten-year-old son
 lekin jald hi nitin ne apni pehali patni se talaak lene kaa vaada kiya or phir donon jaise ek-duusare ke or bhi zyada kareeb aa gaye
 Priyanka's life was now at a beautiful juncture
 chah maheene kii mohabbat ke baad isi saal 6 janvari ko donon ek aaleeshaan marij seremani ke jariye hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye ek-duusare ke ho gaye
 But not even a month had passed since this marriage that life took such a U-turn, where all the ways of Priyanka's escape were suddenly closed
 priyanka ke liye pehali bivi ko talakarestro-baar kaa bijness karanevaala dilli kaa kaarobaari nitin chawla greater kailash main ek or restaurant kholane kii taiyaari main tha
 And in connection with this, he wanted to organize an event
 pichley saal april maheene main ek roj wo is event ke silsile main pehali baar priyanka se mila, lekin donon kii ye peshgat mulaakaat pyaar main tabdeel ho gai
 Nitin soon proposed to Priyanka for marriage, but the problem was that Nitin was already married and Priyanka was not ready to become Nitin's second wife as a wife
 aise main nitin ke paas do raste the - yaa to wo priyanka ko bhul kar apni jindagi main waapas laut jaataa yaa phir priyanka ke liye apni pehali bivi ko chhod detaa
 Nitin chose another route
 pyaar ke liye priyanka apano se ho gai doorusane apni pehali bivi ko chhodane kaa faisla kar liya or chah maheene ke andar nitin ne apni patni se talaak le liya
 On the other hand, Priyanka's family members were also initially angry with Priyanka's relationship
 yahaan tak ki khud priyanka or uski maa ke bich kaaphi dinon tak nitin ko lekar hi baatcheet bhi band rahi
 But after marriage, Nitin also rented a flat in Delhi's posh defense colony apart from his family to live with Priyanka
 lekin isse pehle ki shaadi ke baad chijen aahista-aahista thik hotin, kahani main twist aa gaya
 According to Priyanka's family, Nitin beat up Priyanka badly one day
 darasal, priyanka apni kisi saheli ke saath nitin ko bina bataae ghar se baahar chali gai thi
 Just this, Nitin was so angry that he started beating Priyanka badly
 police ke paas kii thi shikayatpriyanka ke liye ye kisi sadame se kam nahin tha
 Yesterday the person was being spread in front of him in his love
 mahange pregents or sarprijej se use impress karne kii koshish karata rahata tha, wo achaanak itnaa khoonkhaar ho jayega, ye priyanka ne shaadi se pehle khwaabon main bhi nahin sochaa tha
 But now after marriage, life was standing in front of Priyanka with her most frightening face
 pehle to priyanka ne apane saath hui in jyaadati ke bare main kisi ko kuch nahin bataaya or khud ko ghar main band kar liya, lekin jab ek saheli usase milane pahunchi, to uske jism main lagi choton ne pehali baar donon ke rishton main ai is talkhi kii chugali kar di
 Now the boundary of the house had gone out
 priyanka jaan bachaane ke liye gharavaalon ke saath-saath police ke paas bhi dastak de chuki thi
 Before marriage and after marriage Nitinleek, before Priyanka took the step to end herself before someone could convince them to settle the matter
 shaadi ke mahaj pandrah dinon ke andar marpet kaa jo silsilaa shuru hua, wo ab jari tha
 Even Nitin was not coming home after fighting Priyanka three days before his suicide
 haalanki donon ke bich telephone par baatcheet jarur ho rahi thi
 On the second day of Holi, on the 25th, Priyanka stopped taking her phone
 udhar, priyanka ko lekar gharavaalon kii phikr lagaataar bad rahi thi or isi ke baad 25 kii raat ko priyanka kii maa apni beti ke liye khaanaa lekar uske flats par pahunchi, lekin vahaan ek dardanaak kahani unka intjaar kar rahi thi
 Priyanka's flat was locked inside and no one opened the door despite playing the calling bell several times
 is par ghabara kar priyanka kii maa ne apane gharavaalon ke saath-saath police ko bhi soochna di
 In the next few minutes, police along with Nitin reached this flat of Defense Colony and the lock was broken
 priyanka ke bedroom kaa manjar dekhte hi sabake pairon tale jameen khisak gai
 Priyanka was hanging from the ceiling fan above her bed with the help of a sardine and her feet were touching the bed
 police ne aanan-fanan main priyanka kii laash ko utaar kar use postmortem ke liye bhijavaya or kamare kii talaashi leni shuru kii
 At first sight, the police found a suicide note written by Priyanka on a table near the bed, in which she recorded the entire story of suicide and also recorded the love story of meeting Nitin and Ruswai
 police ne pehle nitin ko poochtacha ke liye roka or phir baad main use apni bivi ko khudakushi ke liye majaboor karne ke jurm main giraftaar kar liya
 Despite this, Nitin was constantly telling himself to be innocent
 police ne or logon se poochtacha kii to priyanka or nitin ke rishton kii ek se bad kar ek chaunkaanewaali kahaniyaan saamne aane lageen
 After all, what was the fight between Nitin and Priyanka
 jis priyanka ko hasil karne ke liye nitin ne apni pehali patni ko chhod diya or priyanka ne apni maa tak se duuri bana lee, un donon ke bich ladaai kii asli vajah aakhir kya thi? to jab police kii tafteesh aage badi, to har koi hairaan rah gaya
 Because of the rift between Priyanka and Nitin, Priyanka was a free-spirited and cheerful girl who loved to hang out with her friends
 lekin nitin shaadi ke baad se hi priyanka ko lekar bahut pojesive ho gaya tha
 He no longer wanted Priyanka to meet anyone and that is why he was also asking her to quit her job
 priyanka iske liye taiyaar nahin thi or ye donon kii anban kii ek badi vajah bani
 The second reason was Nitin's children
 nitin apane donon bacchon ko apane saath rakhana chahta tha, lekin priyanka iske liye taiyaar nahin ho rahi thi or ye baad nitin ko nagavar guzar rahi thi

 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne madrason kii chuttee kaatane kii ghoshnaa kii, to shikshakon ne is par naaraazgi jataai
 The Islamic Madrasa Modernization Teachers Association asked that the CM have time to consider the holiday deduction, but did not worry about the stagnant salary for the last two years
 madrason kii chhuttiyon ko kam karne ke upi sarkaar ke aadesh se madrason ke shikshak khafa hai, lekin ve isse bhi zyada is baat se naaraaz hai ki unako do saal se vetan nahin mila
 Ejaz Ahmad, president of the Islamic Mothers' Modernization Teachers Association of UP, said that cutting the holidays of madrasa teachers is nothing more than politics
 unhone kaha ki agar madrase ek khaas dharm ke logon ke liye hai, to unamem khaas dharm se jude tyohaar bhi honge
 In such a situation, it is not right to take away their right to leave for festivals
 ek taraf to sarkaar 'sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas' kaa naaraa lagaati he, to duusari taraf aise kadam uthaakar sarkaar kya sabit karnaa chaahati he? madrason ko nijee taur par 10 chhuttiyaan tay karne kaa adhikaar tha
 How is it permissible to cut them for four days? a few months ago, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had issued a decree that there would be a holiday on the national festivals in addition to Muslim community festivals in madrasas
 ejaj ahamed kaa kahana he ki mukhyamantri ne madrason ke aadhunikeekaran ke liye kya kadam uthaae hai? ve kehete hai ki saal 2015-16 or 2016-17 yani do saal se hamen centre kii taraf se milane vaala vetanman nahin diya gaya he
 Central government did not get the salary
 Ahmad said that both the state and the center have a share in the pay scale of the teachers of Islamic madrasa modernization
 graduate teacher ko do hajaar rupee rajya or aath hajaar rupee centre detaa he, jabaki post graduate teacher ko teen hajaar rupee rajya or 12 hajaar rupee centre detaa he
 He is getting salary from the state, but the salary of the center has not come for two years
 ahamed kehete hai ki upi ke siem yogi adityanath ko is baat kii phikr honi chahie ki aakhir ye shikshak kaise apana ghar chalaa rahe hai
 When Islamic Madrasa teaches in modernization 8 thousand teachers RP Singh, Joint Director of the Islamic Madrasa Board was asked about this, he said that in fact the work of updating the online portal of the Madrasa Board is going on
 basic shiksha vibhaag kii taraf se in madrason ko you-dise (uniphid district information system for ajukeshan) number jari kiya ja rahaa he
 Pay will be released as soon as the portal is updated
 haalanki unhone kaha ki saadhe aath hajaar teacher hai, jo islamic madrasa aadhunikeekaran main padhaate hai
 Stalled salary will be released in a month, RP Singh said that some of these teachers have also been issued salary
 do saal kaa vetan bahut kam teachers kaa roka gaya he, jabaki ek saal se vetan na milane kii baat unhone bhi sweekaar kii
 He explained the reason for this, not the government's slowness, but the process of updating the portal
 unke mutabik ek maheene ke bheetar sara rukaa vetan jari kar diya jayega
 Madrasas were targeted for policing politics: Aijaz Ejaz Ahmad says that only the work of policing politics is being done by targeting madrasas
 bayaan dekar voton kaa dhruvikaran kiya ja rahaa he
 Earlier Shigufa was left to implement NCERT syllabus
 is baat ko chaar maheene se zyada ho gaye, lekin ab tak yah pataa nahin chalaa ki iske liye kya kiya ja rahaa he?madrason ke nae silebus ke liye bani thi cametiis par madrasa board ke joint diarector arapy singh kehete hai ki iske liye cameti bani thi
 He has submitted his report
 isamen madrason kii shiksha ke moolyankan or taur tareekon main badlaav karne ke liye kuch salaah di gai hai
 The most important thing is that in this report, it has been said to create a cell in which students can register their complaints related to the examination
 haalanki abhi final report nahin ai he
 Aamir Khan's film Dangal is making a lot of noise in theaters

 lekin asal jindagi main coach ke saath mahavir phogot se achche sambandh rahe hai
 Geeta is shown in the final matchfilm that in the final match Geeta is losing and in the final she wins by placing a five-digit bet
 lekin kaamanwealth game ke final bout main gita ne virdohi pahalwaan ko ekatarfa mukaable main maat di thi

 The name of the coach is shown by Pramod Kadam as Geeta's coach in Badlafilm, while during the Games the coach of the women's team was Pyara Ram Sondhi
 film main coach ke kirdaar ko negative dikhaaya gaya he
 But in reality, he is not such a coach
 mahavir phogat or sondhi ke bich kisi tarah kii koi daraar nahin thi
 Geeta is India's first Indian woman wrestler who qualified for the 2012 London Olympics Clothes in the final bout At the Commonwealth Games, Geeta was blue when she entered the final
 lekin film ke dauraan gita ne nile rang ke kapade to pahane hai lekin shed puri tarah alag he

 The government says that those who talk and criticize the failure of demonetisation are confused
 aise log notebandi ke puure uddeshy ko samaj nahin paa rahe hai
 Has demonetization proved to be a flop? After the RBI data, the opposition attacker, Jaitley gave the cleanliness department is investigating the jet, some people are commenting about it after demonetisation that the only purpose of demonetisation was that people do not deposit money and money is seized
 Will go
 jin logon ne jivan main kabhi kaale dhan ke khilaaf jang nahin ladi, wo shaayad is puri prakriya kaa uddeshy samaj nahin paae
 This was not the purpose of confiscating money
 banking system main paisa aa jaae to iskaa matlab ye nahin ki wo puraa paisa vaid he
 The Income Tax Department conducts a full investigation against this money
 yahi kaaran he lakhon logon ko notice par daalaa gaya he
 One of the direct effects is that the direct tax base has increased

 'not every deposit is valid' Arun Jaitley said that the purpose of demonetisation was to increase the tax base
 iskaa yah bhi ye uddeshy tha ki kaledhan jamaa karne vaale logon ke khilaaf kaarywahi ho

 In such a situation, if money comes in the system then it does not become legitimate money
 arun jetali ne kaha ki sarkaar ke saare uddeshy trek par hai

 On this, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that the purpose of demonetisation was not to deposit money
 notebandi se nakli noton kaa pataa chalaa
 Its goal was to increase the scope of tax
 notebandi se aatankwaad or naksalwad par asar padaa
 Jaitley's clarification on RBI report - Money deposit was not intended for demonetisation, black money was banned in the election
 nakadi kaa aadan-pradaan 17 pratishat kam ho gaya he
 The impact of demonetisation is on the right track and the steps that the center will take in future will be based on that
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki sarkaar kaa aglaa kadam chunaav main kaledhan par roak lagaana he
 Jaitley said that those who have little understanding of dealing with black money are linking the cash in banks with demonetisation
 notebandi kaa uddeshy arthvyavastha main nakadi par nirbharta kam karnaa, digitalykaran karnaa, kar dayera badhanaa or kaale dhan se nipatna tha

 Now tell the farmer what to do? Thousands of farmers from 17 states in Delhi's Parliament Street asked for their demands before the country's government
 engiti ke farmaan par bhi bigade kisanuttar pradesh ke muradabad jile se aae gaurav tiwari kehete hai, abhi to ham fasal ke bhav or laagat ke antar se hi jujh rahe the us par ab engiti kaa tughluqi farmaan aa gaya ki dijal ke vaahan das saal se zyada nahin chalenge
 He says, you tell me, "the tractor runs 200-250 hours a year
 ek tractor kii puri kshamta 50,000 ghante hoti he
 In such a situation, a tractor will run a maximum of 25,00 hours in ten years
 yani 25,00 ghante kii kshamta kaa upyog kisaan kar hi nahin paaegaa
 Kisan Lal, standing close, says, "if the farmer is a burden on the country, then why doesn't the government give us poison
 na rahegaa kisaan na hongi maange
 'all farmers standing around on Kisan Lal's words are filled with hunkies
 kareeb khadi ek mahila kisaan kahati he
 The farmer is crying tears of blood
 is sarkaar ko hamaari hai lagegi

 The cost is going up and the government is saying that by 2022, the arrival of farmers will be doubled
 chal to har sarkaar ne kiya lekin ye sarkaar to hadein paar kar gai
 Finally, says Ramanand Parmar of Madhya Pradesh
 bajet main sarkaar ne 37,000 kaa praavdhaan kheti kisaani ke liye kiya he
 We say that the total debt of farmers is 18,000 crores
 use maaf kar do baaki ham khud mehnat kar lenge

 ' The man who had lost one of his legs in a heart-wrenching blast outside the Delhi High Court was splashing in an attempt to get away from it and the carcasses of the casualties were strewn on the ground with broken vials of carriages
 dhamaake ke baad parisar main khun se sane kapadon main vakil or vaadi bachane ke liye idhar-udhar bhaagate dekhe gaye
 One adult woman who witnessed the blast was so frightened that she was unable to speak
 ghatana ke vakt unka rishtedaar rahul gupta dhamaake se kareeb 10 meter kii duuri par tha or ab use sunne main pareshaani ho rahi he
 She came to get Rahul's bail
 swaagat kaksh ke paas khadey rahul gupta kaa kahana he ki baharaa kar dene vaale is dhamaake kii aawaaj ke baad kuch sun nahin paa rahe
 Outside the court, security personnel of an under construction site, Narendra Kumar Singh, said, "I heard the loud sound of the blast and saw the smell of smoke
" yah dhamaakaa adaalat ke get number-5 par hua
 At the time of the incident, 100-200 people were queuing up waiting for their turn to get admission and a large number of lawyers were also present
 ek mahila vakil ne bataaya ki unhone adaalat kii ore jate samay tej dhamaakaa suna
 He refused to reveal his identity
 unhone kaha, jab tak main vahaan pahunchati, police ne raste band kar die the or logon ko aspataal le jaaya ja rahaa tha
 i parked my car in the parking lot and went near the door
 main vaaki dar gai thi or aashaa karti hum ki mere dost ghayal na hue hon
