 RJD supremo Lalu Prasad on Wednesday claimed about his staunch opponent and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar that he had stepped down and only a formal announcement after the election was left
 sitamarhi ke purv congressi saansad ram shreshth singh or jadyu ke aurangabad jila upaadhyaksh sunil singh ke rajd main shaamil hone par swaagat karte hue lalu ne nitish kumaar ke bare main yah daawa kiya
 Describing Bihar's NDA government as a failure on all fronts, Lalu accused Nitish of betraying his old colleagues Prabhunath Singh and Lalan Singh along with other sections of society including Sarvana and Akalit of the state
 lalu ne kaha ki jab ve centre main pichhali samprag sarkaar main shaamil the to bihar ke vikaas ke liye apane prabhaav kaa istemaal kar kai yojanaayen is pradesh ke liye aavantit karwaai par pradesh sarkaar usko thik dhang se lagu nahin kar saki
 The RJD supremo alleged that neither a medical and engineering college was opened in Bihar nor a branch of Aligarh Muslim University has been opened till now
 pradesh sarkaar par udyog kii sthapana ke liye nivesh ko protsaahit karne yaa ek bhi megawatt bijli kaa utpaadan karne main vifal rahane kaa aarope lagaate hue lalu ne kaha ki rajya kii ek bhi chini mil ko vartmaan sarkaar chaalu nahin kar paayi
 RJD supremo Lalu Prasad accused Bihar's Nitish government of staying in power with the help of advertisements and said that this government has committed a fraud of Rs 32 thousand in various schemes of the state
 lalu ne in chunaavon main apni jeet kaa daawa karte hue kaha ki bihar kii akliyat, pichhadi or savarna sahit sabhi jatiyon ne pradesh kii vartmaan sarkaar ko asann chunaav main satta se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa dene kaa faisla kiya he

 Digvijay Singh, who has created a stir in the political corridors by his statements, maintains his statement in which he said that the model of separation between the Prime Minister and the Congress President has not proved to be effective

 On Janardan Dwivedi's statement, Digvijay said that the party's opinion is different and my opinion is different
 main apane bayaan par kaayam hum
 He said that everyone has the right to express his opinion but will accept whatever the party says
 haalanki ant main digvijay singh ne kaha ki jo party kaa mat he vahi ab meraa mat he
 Actually, a few days ago Digvijay Singh said that the model of separation between the Prime Minister and the Congress President has not proved to be effective
 jiske baad congress mahasachiv janardan dvivedi ne piem or sonia ke rishton ko behatar bataakar digvijay singh ke bayaan ko khaarij kar diya jaae
 Manmohan will put a hat-trick of PM! Manmohan Singh should be presented as a contender for the post of UPA
 ye sanket congress mahasachiv janardan dvivedi ke bayaan se niklaa he
 Janardan Dwivedi, who described Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh as a political hit, has made allegations of two power centers in the Congress a political ideal

 The 11 AAP legislators have voting rights
 meeting kii lokation ke aasapaas police ne kisi bhi anhoni kii ashanka ko dekhte hue kade suraksha intjaam kiye hai
 The commotion started before the meeting started
 'gaddaaron ko baahar nikaalo' ke naare lagaae ja rahe hai
 Party insiders say that in this meeting it will be proposed to sack Yadav and Bhushan from the national executive and expel them from the party
 AAP sutron kaa kahana he ki party ke zyaadaatar netaa yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaakar yah sandesh dena chaahate hai ki party main baghawat bilkul bardaasht nahin kii jaaegi, chaahe wo kitne hi bade kad kaa netaa kyon na ho
 Supporting leaders of Arvind Kejriwal allege that Yogendra and Prashant were repeatedly plotting against the party convenor
 iske alaava dilli chunaav main party kii haar sunishchit karne kaa kaam kar rahe the
 Both these activities are anti-party
 aise main inhen party se hataaya jaae

 According to sources, strategy has been made for the National Council meeting
 yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan kejariwal ko kadi takkar dene ke mood se maidan main utar rahe hai
 Before the meeting, the two wrote to the party and put forward several demands
 shuukravaar ko prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav ne press conference karke jis tarah tarah kejariwal or unke gut par hamalaa bolaa, usase yah saaf ho gaya ki kejariwal gut ke saath unki sulah kii sabhi sambhaavnaaen khatm ho chuki hai
 According to sources, out of the total 350 members of the National Council, only 100 members have the support of Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan
 saaf hai aankade kejariwal ke paksh main dikh rahe hai
 Therefore, the cards of both the old partners and the founding members of the party can be cleared
 sutron ke mutabik prabal sambhaavna he ki donon ko party se baahar nikaal diya jaae
 But at the same time, a big question has also arisen in the way that the sourness between the two camps has come to the fore, will the National Council meeting be concluded in a peaceful manner
 saamne aayaa kejariwal kaa ek or stingrashtriya parishad kii baithak se ek din pehle shuukravaar ko yogendra or prashanth bhushan samarthak gut ke maane jane vaale bihar ke netaa umesh singh ne kejariwal kaa ek audio tepe jari kar hadakamp machaa diya
 Kejriwal was heard using objectionable words in this tape
 itnaa hi nahin, us tepe main kejariwal aam aadmi party ko todakar ek nayaa dal banane kii baat bhi karte sune gaye
 Kejriwal faction came to the rescue as soon as the damage was realized, but people are not digesting them
 alag party bana sakate hai bhushan or yadavakhabar he ki aam aadmi party se baahar hone ke baad prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav apni nai raajnneetik party kaa elaan kar sakate hai
 If sources are to be believed, the two leaders started preparing to form their own party only when they started a rebellion

 Then a senior minister, Narendra Singh said, why not to pass this resolution in today's cabinet meeting

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to farmers today
 unhone bemausam barish se barabaad hui fasalon kaa or kisaanon kii pareshaaniyon kaa zikr kiya, lekin aaj 'man kii baat' main piem ne adhiktar baaten bhoomi adhigrahan bill par hi kendrit rakhin
 PM said, there are 13 laws in Hindustan, in which the maximum land is edited, such as railways, national highway, mine works
 pichhali sarkaar ke kanoon main in 13 chizon ko baahar rakhaa gaya
 This means that the maximum amount of land is taken for these 13 types of work, in which farmers will get the same compensation that was given by the earlier law
 piem ne kaha, mujhe bataaie, ye kami thi ki nahin? galati thi ki nahin? hamane isko thik kiya or hamane kaha ki in 13 main bhi bhale sarkaar ko jameen lene kii jarurat ho, bhale railway ke liye ho, bhale haive banane ke liye ho, lekin uskaa muaavja bhi kisaan ko chaar guna tak milanaa chahie
 
 
 Is this anti-farmer? piem ne kaha, ek hawa aisi failaai gai ki modi aisa kanoon laa rahe hai ki kisaanon ko ab muaavja puraa nahin milegaa, kam milegaa
 
 
 i can't even think of such a sin
 2013 kii pichhali sarkaar ke samay bane kanoon main jo muaavja tay hua he, us main ratti bhar bhi fark nahin kiya gaya he
 Up to four times the compensation we have accepted
 piem ne kaha ki shaharikaran ke liye jo bhoomi kaa adhigrahan hoga, usamen viksit bhoomi, 20 pratishat us bhoomi maalik ko milegi, taaki usko aarthik rup se hameshaa laabh mili, ye bhi hamane jari rakhaa he
 The young man of the family gets a job
 
 
 hamane ek nai chiz jodi he
 
 
 The officers of the district will have to declare who will get the job in it, who will get the job, where will they get the work, the government will have to declare it in writing
 piem modi ne kaha, yah Social Impact Assessment (SIA) ke naam par agar prakriya saalon tak chalati rahe, sunwaayee chalati rahe, mujhe bataaie, aisi sthiti main koi kisaan apane faisle kar paaegaa? fasal boni he, to wo sochega nahin-nahin yaar, pataa nahin, wo nirnay aa jayega to, kya karuunga? or uske 2-2, 4-4, saal kharaab ho jaaenge or afasarshahi main chijen fansi rahengi
 The PM told the farmers, "I want to tell you on the injury of Danke, also in the new ordinance, any private industrialist, private factory owner, private businessman, the law made in 2013 at the time of acquiring land, All the rules are applicable to them
 yah corporate ke liye kanoon 2013 ke vaise ke vaise lagu rahane vaale hai
 Then why this lie is spread
 
 
 ek bhram failaayaa jaataa he ki aapako kanoonee haq nahin milegaa, aap court main nahin ja sakate, ye saraasar jhooth he
 He said, an illusion is spread that 'consent' is not needed
 2013 main jo kanoon bana, usame bhi sarkaar ne jin yojanaon ke liye jameen maangi he, usamen sahmati kaa kanoon nahin he or isiilie sahmati ke naam par logon ko bhramit kiya jaataa he
 There was no talk of consent for the government, it is not there even today
 
 That is why my farmer brothers and sisters were very good at first and we did bad, this is absolutely an unfortunate attempt to mislead you
 main aaj bhi kahata hum ki nijee udyog ke liye, corporate ke liye, privet kaarkaanon ke liye ye 'sahmati' kaa kanoon chaalu he
 PM Modi said, there were shortcomings in the Land Acquisition Bill, our authentic efforts to remove those deficiencies
 or phir bhi maine sansad main kaha tha kii abhi bhi kisi ko lagata he ki koi kami he, to ham usko sudhaar karne ke liye taiyaar hai

 The Congress did not know how to respond to terror
 unhone likhaa ki yah new india he, ham aatankwaadiyon ko unheen kii bhashaa main jawaab dena jaanate hai jise wo samajhate hai or wo bhi byaaj ke saath

 tab ham bhi jawaab de sakate the or apane vimaan bhej sakate the lekin mere hisaab se ye sahi tareeqa nahin he
 You cannot deal with such other countries

 This is a New India- we will answer terrorists in a language they understand and with interest! https: / / t

 ramgopal yadav ji jaise varisht netaa kaa yah bayaan un sabhi kaa apmaan karata he jinhone kashmir kii raksha karne main apni jaan kii baaji laga di
 He wrote that it insults our martyrs and their families
 bataa den ki samaajawaadee party ke netaa ram gopal yadav ne pulavama aatanki hamale ko 'sajeesh' bataaya he
 He said that when the government changes, it will be investigated and big people will be trapped
 Opposition is the natural habitat of terror apologists and questioners of our armed forces
 This reprehensible statement by a senior leader like Ram Gopal Ji insults all those who have given their lives in protecting Kashmir
 It humiliates the families of our martyrs

 Has been affected
 australia main worldcup ke aayojan ko bhi satorie bhartiya team ke khilaadiyon ke liye makul nahin maanate hai

 kahin aisa to nahin ki aapaki patni bistar par aane se kataraati hai, kabhi sir dard to kabhi thake hone ke bahaane unke paas hameshaa taiyaar rahete hai
 This is why the distances between you two are also increasing
 or jab kabhi aapane pyaar se unase iskaa kaaran poocha he, to vah na kehane kii vajah hameshaa dard ko bataati hai

 Recently, Indiana University conducted a study and found that 30% of women experience bed pain, while only 5% of men
 is adhyayan main 18 se 59 saal ke jodon ko shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Another point came from the study is that most of the women experience pain in the moments spent in bed due to their own thinking
 zyaadaatar logon kaa maananaa yahi hota he ki bistar par mahilaon ko purushon ke bajaay zyada dard ko sahanaa padataa he or unki yahi soch mahilaon ko bistar par kamjor bana detii hai
 So do not forget to mentally prepare them for the next time before spending a colorful moment on the bed with your love

Axis Bank's explanation said that in normal business, the bank transacts on letter of undertaking issued by other banks through its overseas branches
 vahiin is maamle main bhi ek bank ke letters of anderteking ko aadhaar maanate hue bank ke nostro acount main paisa daalaa gaya

 Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee has termed the education policies of Kejriwal government as hollow
 shuukravaar ko congress ne shiksha niti par 'dilli sarkaar kii shiksha kii sachai-ek bhandaphod' naam se bocolate jari kiya
 On this occasion, Delhi Congress President Ajay Maken said - Kejriwal government has misled people in the last 3 years regarding education
 'makanne kaha, 'is sarkaar ne jhuthe daawey kiye hai
 Maken said that for the first time in the history of Delhi, in the last 2 years, nearly one lakh students have left government schools, while 1 in private schools
 42 lakh chaatro kii badhotaree hui he
 Maken showed the figures on the slide show that, '0 in the increase of senior secondary schools in Delhi

 While Delhi's population averages 2

 'ajay maakan ne kaha ki, 'ye chintajanak he ki aam aadmi party kii dilli sarkaar ke pichley 2 saal ke kaarykaal main shiksha ke bajet main se 1982 karod rupaya laps hua he
 'maken said,' Kejriwal government always claims that they have increased the record on education, but it does not say how much of the education budget was spent
 pichley 2 saal main shiksha ke bajet main se 1982 karod rupaya laps hua he
 Whereas this is in sharp contrast to the tenure of the Congress government in Delhi
 unhone kaha, 'congress kii dilli sarkaar jahaan shiksha ke bajet ko overaspend karti thi
 At the same time, this money is being lost in the Delhi government of the Aam Aadmi Party

 yah pehali sarkaar he, jiske sau din puure hone se haftaa bhar pehle hi sau din ke kaamkaaj kaa hisaab kitaab ho rahaa he
 When a news channel can be called twenty-four hours by running eighteen hours, then why can't it be considered a hundred days before four five days
 vaise aaj yani mangalvaar ko 100 din puure ho gaye hai
 Many 1999 articles have been found on the internet which were written after the completion of hundred days of Atal Bihari Vajpayee government
 patrakarita ke shilalekhon se gyaat hota he ki sau din manaane kii parampara twitrgaman, fesabukaagaman or kai arthon main chainlaagaman se pehle kii he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is saying that by playing drums with his bare hands on Japan tour, everything is under his control and as you know about him he is probably not complete
 drum kii tarah abhi kuch or jaananaa baaki he
 Even in Japan, they are mentioning hundred days in all their speeches
 unke daure ke pal-pal kii jaankaree media ke tamaam madhyamon se prasaarit ho rahi he
 He is more in India than in Japan
 100 din kii charchaa unke tamaam bhaashanon main he
 i tell the representatives of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce that if i look at my tenure of the last 100 days, i was new to national politics for such a big post
 main process main kabhi nahin rahaa tha
 Despite all these limitations came from a small state, the results of the initiative that we have taken within 100 days are clearly visible today
 secret heart uniwarsity main bhi kehete hai ki 100 din hue hai sarkaar ko
 In my cabinet, there are 25 percent women
 itnaa hi nahin hamaari jo videshmantri hai vah bhi mahila hi hai
 Talking to industrialists on September 2, he said that within the first 100 days, his government has reduced red tape, and red tape, and removed the bottlenecks related to trade
 isse pehle ek sitambar ko pradhanmantri ne aisi hi ek sabha main kaha ki gujarati hone ke naate paisa mere koon main he
 Commerce and business are in my blood
 bijnes main aapako riyaayat nahin chahie, balki maahaul chahie
 Manmohan Singh became known as an economist, but never dared to say that business or money is in my blood
 vaise koon main bijness he, aisi baat kehane kaa madda modi ke samakaleen netaaon main bhi nahin hai
 Business means government at work
 bijepi ke pravaktaaon ke bayaan main bhi yah baat baar−baar aati he ki pehle din se kaam hi to kar rahe hai
 It is obvious that the Prime Minister is presenting himself to evaluate them on the parameters of the economy
 raksha, beemaa, rail main videshi nivesh kii maatra badhaane kaa faisla lekar sarkaar ne yah sanket diya ki ve raajnneetik virodh ke baavjood jokhim uthaa sakate hai
 GDP rate during april-may-june this year

 7 pratishat hui he
 This figure has been crossed for the first time in two years, which has increased the confidence of the government
 arun jetali ne kaha he ki aane vaale dinon main vikaas dar main or tezi aegi
 The Finance Minister said that the attitude of foreign investors has changed rapidly
 mahangaai ke bare main prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha ki sau din main kam karne kaa vaada upie ne 2009 main kiya tha, hamane nahin
 We have started tightening the rein
 ek dedh saal main fark dikhegaa
 At the same time, Congress and Aam Aadmi Party have asked where are the black money
 chunaav ke dauraan subramanyam swami or rajnath singh ne kaha tha ki saath se sau din main 120 lakh karod le aaenge
 It is also being asked on social media that why Baba Ramdev, who was vocal before the election about black money, is not speaking now? ab aate hai raajnneetik front par
 It was criticized that only and only the Prime Minister appears
 prakaash jaavdekar kehete hai ki yah team modi kii kamyaabi he
 All ministers are working together
 uttar pradesh bijepi ke aakraamak bayanon ke sandarbh main poocha ja rahaa he ki das saal tak nafrat-hinsa kii raajnneeti ko multavee karne ke pradhanmantri ke aahvaan kaa kya hua? There was also a dispute over the removal of governors and the hooting of chief ministers in the Prime Minister's government programs
 rajnath singh ne apane parivaar ke prati kathith aaropon ko afvaah bataakar maamla saarvajanik kar diya, to safai piemo or bijepi donon taraf se ai
 The Congress has asked that the Prime Minister contested the UPA scandals as an issue and today they should tell what was the scam
 ek morcha videsh niti kaa bhi he or ek pahalu aadhaar card jaisi upie kii kai nitiyon kii nirantarata kaa bhi or in sabake bich pradhanmantri kaa khud ko baar-baar bahari bataanaa
 When the media started running a hundred day type program on the thirty days of the government, on June 26, he wrote in his blog that i am facing a big challenge in Delhi
 logon ke kuch samooh bane hue hai, jinhen badlaav laane kii manshaa or uski gambhirtha ko samajha paane main kathinaayee aa rahi he
 These are people who are inside and outside the government as well
 mujhe lagata he ki is system ko majboot karne kii zarurat he
 The Prime Minister is talking about being outsiders in Japan as well and on August 15, he also said to the Red Fort that i am not a human being in the world of Delhi
 main yahaan ke raaj kaaj ko bhi nahin jaanata
 i have been very untouched by the elite class here, but i was shocked when an outsider came to Delhi and took an insider view in the last two months
 aisa laga ki sarkaar ke andar bhi darjanon alag-alag sarkarein chal rahi hai
 Like everyone, he has his own fiefdom
 ek department duusare se bhid rahe hai
 i started trying to demolish these walls so that there would be a stable government
 baar-baar bahari hone kii baat lekin satta par niyantran kii purna khabaron ke bich agar koi nai kaarysamskruti bani he, to kya vah sarkaar ke prati aapaki samaj ko bhi nae tareeke se banaati he
 Can the assessment be made on the basis of difference of feeling of not having the government before 16 May and after that
 kya modi yah ahsaas dilaane main safal hue hai ki dilli main ek sarkaar he jo he or chal rahi he
 Who speaks as much or as much as she does
 kisi ko samvaad kaa atirek lag saktaa he, magar koi yah to nahin kah saktaa ki samvaad nahin he
 a rape case of a female lawyer has come to light in Saket Court, Delhi
 aaropee vakil hi he or ghatana court parisar main hui he
 The lawyer is arrested and his chamber is sealed
 main iskaa zikr isliye nahin kar rahaa kyonki kisi report main bharat ko mahilaon ke liye sabase asurakshit jagah bataaya gaya he
 i am not even doing this so that some people come out to vent their anger that they should all be hanged at the crossroads
 darasal main isiilie kah rahaa hum, kyonki faansee-faansee karke hamane hasil kuch nahin kiya
 Many states added the death penalty but cruelty towards women in our society did not end there
 ant chhodie, lagata nahin ki aisi ghatnaayen kam ho rahi hai
 In the coming days, such an incident is definitely more cruel than the previous one
 13 july kii raat is jagah par ek mahila balaatkaar ke baad aag main jhonk di gai
 The woman whose ashes here was alive when she was with her young daughter
 tabhi paanch log aae or use agava karke le gaye
 He was raped by the five and left there
 unke jane ke baad mahila police ko 100 number dial karti rahi magar kisi ne nahin uthaaya
 Husband got the call but did not get it
 bhai satish ko number lagaaya laga to sari baat bataa di
 Meanwhile, the culprits returned again and took the woman from there
 mandir ke paas pujari kii is kothri main mahila ko jalati aag main jhonk diya
 Nobody listened to her scream, she burnt to death
 satish ne bataaya ki jab vah aadhi raat baad pahunchaa to dekha ki bahan jal rahi thi or vahaan unki saas baithkar ro rahi thi
 At that time the fire was burning, which Satish extinguished
 satish ne bataaya ki pujari kii kothri khaali thi
 The priest had gone out
 iskaa phayda uthaakar apradhi mahila ko vahaan le gaye or jala diya
 The temple priest's cell has not been mentioned so that someone again starts doing hindu-muslim on social media under the pretext of an incident like Mandsaur
 yah ghatana pujari kii kothri ke alaava bhi kahin hui hoti to bhi krur he or ham sabko sharmasaar karne ke liye kaaphi he
 You are sitting in your homes, but think for a moment about these women gathered at this place, how they must have been deeply hurt, they may not have words like ours, to condemn, to retaliate, to bear
 Apart from the words of stay
 thik aisi ghatana isi saal may ke maheene ho chuki he
 When the family members complained to the panchayat after raping an 18-year-old girl in Chatra, Jharkhand, the panchayat fined them for not handing over the culprits to the police
 aparaadhiyon ne panchayat kaa farmaan maanane se inkaar kar diya or ghar main ghus kar aag laga di or ladki jal kar mar gai
 Who is responsible for this is at the center of debate or not
 darasal bharat ke mard duniya ke sabase nirdosh praani hai
 They are not responsible for anything, because the rule of law never treated them properly
 samaaj or raajnneeti ne unhen hameshaa hi sar par chadhaakar rakhaa he
 If properly treated, then the Airhostess Anisia of Delhi would not have to die by jumping from the roof
 june maheene main hi unke pita ne thane main shikaayat darj karai thi ki anisia kaa pati dahej ke liye pratadit karata he
 Anisa has been postmortem again
 is ghatana ko padhate samay yahi soch rahaa tha ki aaj kii ladkiyaan apane mulk or samaaj ke bare main kya sochati hongi, Engineer Mohammad Azam Ahmed, who works at Google in Bidar, Karnataka, has run over the car
 iske chaaron taraf bheed khadi he
 The crowd is quarreling with the police not to remove the injured from the vomited car as the children are thieves in it
 ye chaar log muslim bahul ilaake main kisi bachche ko chocolate baant rahe the, tabhi manor kumaar ne kathith rup se inaki tasviir lekar whatsap par daal diya ki ye baccha chor hai
 The bus reached the crowd there
 ye chaaron apni is laal car main bhaagane lage jo yahaan ulti padi he
 Our colleague Nihal Kidwai says that the police postmortem report is awaited only then will it be known that Mohammed Azam was killed by a mob or his car crashed while running, resulting in his death
 aazam ke do saathi abhi bhi aspataal main hai or ek ko chhod diya gaya he
 The mob could have caught them and handed them over to the police, but think very quickly about where the craze of siege is going to take place, otherwise it is the same craze that burns a woman after rape and whatsapp After being surrounded, she kills someone
 har taraf bheed kaam par he
 i do not know when she will surround and kill whom on the basis of which rumor
 hamaare sahyogi shrinivasana jain kii 'truth vs Hype' main is baat kii padtaal kii gai he ki aisi afvaahon ke peeche sirf whatsap nahin he, balki sthaneey str par media bhi aisi afvaahon ko khabar ke rup main chhap detaa he, jiske kaaran logon ke bich uski vishwasaneeyata bad jaati he
 Shruti Menon's report from Dhule states that a person named Rashid had made a video capsule of such a rumor and played it on the media live channel, in which it was said to give such information to the police
 jharkhand se bhi yahi khabar he ki aisi khabaren sthaneey akhabaaron main chhapi hai
 Most children and teenagers are seen in the crowd that surrounded Qasim in Hapur of UP
 in tak afvaah pahunchi ki inhone gaay ko maar diya he
 Later, this picture of the police dragging Kasim was also revealed, for which the UP Police had apologized
 police ne is maamle main 4 logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 Yudhishthir Singh Sisodia has been made the main accused
 vaise 18 dinon baad vah zamaanat par baahar bhi he or apane ghar main he
 Questions are also being raised about getting the vine so easily
 police ne is maamle main sampradayik jhagade kaa zikr nahin kiya he
 Police has said a quarrel over the motorcycle
 lekin kasim ke saath samuddin ke bhai ne bataaya ki uski hatya gaumance ke andeh main kii gai he
 His family was threatened that he would not be allowed to visit the brother until he signed the complaint
 jabaki bel ke aadesh main likhaa he ki police cese main ise road rej yani sadak durghatana ke samay gusse ko kaaran bataaya gaya
 But in the case diary it is written that the case was instigated on cow slaughter
 police kahati he ki uske paas samuddin kaa bayaan he magar usne koi bayaan hi nahin diya he
 Mary of 'truth vs Hype' has discovered all this
 kasim ke parivaar waalon ne kaha ki kasim bakrii kaa bijness karata tha
 Not cow's
 mariyam ne mukhya aaropee se baat kii to vah saaf-saaf kah rahaa he ki gau maance ko lekar hi jhagada hua tha
 Anytime anywhere a crowd is being formed
 usne kanoon ko apane haath main le liya he
 It is not so difficult to understand this crowd pattern
 pradhanmantri aaj pashchim bengal ke midanapur main sabha kar rahe the, unke manch ke bagal kaa shaamiyana gir gaya
 The Prime Minister appealed to stand there peacefully and remained restrained himself
 chalis logon ko aspataal pahunchaaya gaya
 An ambulance for the Prime Minister was also put in this work
 kaayade se pradhanmantri kii sabha main aisi ghatana ko suraksha main chook mana janaa chahie
 Now what you are seeing is not watching at all for the last time
 ye tasviren pashchim bengal se hai
 If people could not reach the Prime Minister's meeting, then the angry policemen fired at them
 khadgpur ke kareeb bijepi samarthakon ne police vaale kii pitayee kar di
 Another soldier was run over by the mob
 ek jagah par sipaahi ko chappalon se maaraa gaya
 One additional SP has been injured
 hamaara desh vaaki badal rahaa he
 The crowd is doing its job
 aaj kal aap aisi khabaren kaaphi dekhte honge ki dalit duulhe ko ghodi par chadhane nahin diya gaya
 When Singh was given the title, he was beaten
 dalit duulhe ne apni baraat nikaalane ke liye police suraksha kii maang kii
 It is reported that if these youth had not asked for a place for themselves, you would have been confused even today that the poison of casteism has been erased
 agar gaanvon main khud ko dabang kahalaane main garv mahasoos karne vaali jati yaa jatiyaan daliton ko baraat tak nikaalane nahin de rahi hai to sochie jaat paat mitaa dene kaa yah sangharsh abhi or kitna lanbaa he
 Is the caste right and arrogance so great that to get constitutional rights, it will have to wait in front of it, will have to fight it
 police kii baraat ke peeche jis sanjay jatav kii baraat aa rahi he wo is tarah se nahin nikalati agar usne zila prashasan, mukhyamantri ko patr likhane se lekar hoicourt jane kaa jhamela nahin mol liya hota
 The Thakurs of the village were against sitting on a horse of a Dalit
 unka kahana tha ki aaj tak dalit ghode par nahin baitha to ab bhi nahi baithegaa
 Does the community, which prevents Sanjay from sitting on the bag, consider themselves above the law and the constitution
 chah maheene lag gaye sanjay ko is choti si azaadi ko hasil karne main
 Later, the administration had to deploy the police at the village level and the procession came out
 jo log baraat kaa virodh kar rahe the unke peeche khufia agency tak lagaai gai
 Where do the people of the village who believe themselves to be domineering, come from where the power goes to interfere in the marriage of another
 uttar pradesh main 30,000 se adhik lekhpal rose news channel is ummid main kholte hai ki aaj hindu muslim dibet nahin hoga, unke hadtaal par baat hogi
 From July 3, they hold a sit-in demonstration in different districts of UP daily from 10 am to 4 pm
 lekhpal ab samaj paa rahe hai ki 30 hazaar kii sankhya hi kaaphi nahin hoti he
 It has been 13 days for their strike and no one knows if the demands will be made or not
 isi bahaane pehle ham jaanate hai ki lekhpal kaam kya karte he or phir dikhaaenge kahaan kaam karte hai
 They mainly do the work of patwari or amin i
e
 they have to do the job of measuring the land
 40 se bhi adhik kaam hote he or upi ke kareeb ek lakh gaanvon ke dastavezon ke jaanane vaale yahi lekhpal hote hai
 Moving from the block office to your fields, their role in the land dispute is very important
 sarkari yojanaon ke liye zamin kii paimaaish kar unhen kabze se nikaalnaa bhi inkaa kaam he
 Apart from this, the work of preparing the data of how many crops were sown and how many crops were done is also with the accountant
 aay jati nivas ke pramaan patr lekhpal hi dete hai
 Overall, the administration's top order in the district stops with the accountants
 unke neeche koi he hi nahin
 Under what circumstances do Lekhpals work in tehsils, you can guess it by video
 hamane kai jagahon se video mangaayen, jinamein se zyaadaatar lekhpal ne hi bheje hai
 Jazim works by laying on the ground
 jarjar ho chuki imaarat ke neeche kaam karte hai
 There is not even a fan in the room
 ped ke neeche baithte hai to baithne kii bhi jagah nahin hoti he
 Toilets for these are made at very few places
 jahaan hai vahaan saaf safai kii koi vyavastha nahin
 If you go to the places of work of the accountants, then you will know that the administration can not only be as cruel to the people as it can be to the people within them
 is video ke zarie aap ghar baithe dekh rahe hai ki zilo main prashasan kaise or kahaan se kaam karata he
 Our colleague Ajay Singh spoke to the accountants sitting on the dharna in Varanasi
 ajay ne bataaya ki apni aath sutri maangon ko lekar lekhpal 13 dinon se dharne par baithe hai
 Four months ago, he also met the Chief Minister and told about his demands but no hearing was held
 lekhpal chaahate hai ki 2000 kii jagah 2800 kaa pe scale mili
 Pension plans prior to 2005 will be applicable
 bhatton main vruddi bahut zaruri he, kyonki kai baar lekhpal apni jeb se paise lagaakar kaam karte hai
 Lekhpalas get a housing allowance of Rs 480 per month, which is very low
 vaaki bahut kam he
 The travel allowance per day is 3 rupees 33 paise, according to which they do not even understand
 steshnari bhatta bhi 3 rupee 33 paise prati din he
 Nowadays, complaints have started coming online
 iske liye inhen sibar cafe main janaa padataa he
 The comments lekhpal chaahate hai ki unhen laptop yaa smart phone diya jaae taaki apana kaam kar saken
 In this way, this lower link of the administration is fighting for its honor
 media inaki ladaai nahin dikhaata he iskaa inhen dukh he magar lekhpal ko khud se bhi poochna chahie ki hadtaal par jane se pehle ve kis tarah ke channel dekh rahe the
 What were watching on the channels
 aisa to hoga ki aap saal bhar channelon par hindu muslim dekhen or jab hadtaal par jaaen to channel patrakarita karne lag jaaen
 Going through these news, the solution of what India has shown you is in the Hindu Muslim debate, sometimes you will ask yourself and others how long this debate will last and why it is running on the channels every other day, you cannot ask this What will you do if this crowd comes to your house? 13 july kii raat is jagah par ek mahila balaatkaar ke baad aag main jhonk di gai

 Going through these news, the solution of what India has shown you is in the Hindu Muslim debate, sometimes you will ask yourself and others how long this debate will last and why it is running on the channels every other day, you cannot ask this What will you do if this crowd comes to your house? satish ne bataaya ki pujari kii kothri khaali thi
 The priest had gone out
 iskaa phayda uthaakar apradhi mahila ko vahaan le gaye or jala diya
 The temple priest's cell has not been mentioned so that someone again starts doing hindu-muslim on social media under the pretext of an incident like Mandsaur

 If you go to the places of work of the accountants, then you will know that the administration can not only be as cruel to the people as it can be to the people within them
 is video ke zarie aap ghar baithe dekh rahe hai ki zilo main prashasan kaise or kahaan se kaam karata he
 Our colleague Ajay Singh spoke to the accountants sitting on the dharna in Varanasi
 ajay ne bataaya ki apni aath sutri maangon ko lekar lekhpal 13 dinon se dharne par baithe hai
 Four months ago, he also met the Chief Minister and told about his demands but no hearing was held
 lekhpal chaahate hai ki 2000 kii jagah 2800 kaa pe scale mili
 Pension plans prior to 2005 will be applicable
 bhatton main vruddi bahut zaruri he, kyonki kai baar lekhpal apni jeb se paise lagaakar kaam karte hai
 Lekhpalas get a housing allowance of Rs 480 per month, which is very low
 vaaki bahut kam he
 The travel allowance per day is 3 rupees 33 paise, according to which they do not even understand
 steshnari bhatta bhi 3 rupee 33 paise prati din he
 Nowadays, complaints have started coming online
 iske liye inhen sibar cafe main janaa padataa he
 The comments lekhpal chaahate hai ki unhen laptop yaa smart phone diya jaae taaki apana kaam kar saken
 In this way, this lower link of the administration is fighting for its honor

 What were watching on the channels
 aisa to hoga ki aap saal bhar channelon par hindu muslim dekhen or jab hadtaal par jaaen to channel patrakarita karne lag jaaen
 Going through these news, the solution of what India has shown you is in the Hindu Muslim debate, sometimes you will ask yourself and others how long this debate will last and why it is running on the channels every other day, you cannot ask this What will you do if this crowd comes to your house? karnataka ke bidar main google main kaam karne vaale ejeeniyar mohammad aazam ahamed kii car ulti padi he
 a crowd is standing around it
 bheed police ke saath jhagada kar rahi he ki ulti padi gaadi se ghayalon ko na nikaale kyonki isamen baccha chor hai
 These four people were distributing chocolate to a child in a Muslim-dominated area, when Manor Kumar allegedly took a picture of them and put it on whatsapp saying that these children are thieves
 bas vahaan bheed pahunch gai
 These four started fleeing in their red car which has vomited here
 hamaare sahyogi nihaal kidawai kaa kahana he ki police postmortem kii report kaa intazaar he tabhi pataa chalegaa ki mohammad aazam ko bheed ne maaraa he yaa bhaagate hue unki car durghatnagrast ho gai, jiske kaaran unki maut hui he
 Azam's two companions are still in the hospital and one has been released
 bheed inhen pakadakar police ke hawaale bhi kar sakati thi magar gherkar maar dene kii sanak kahaan se paidaa ho rahi he, is par aap jaldi hi gaharaai se sochen, varna yah vahi sanak he jo ek mahila ko balaatkaar ke baad jala detii he or whatsap dekhne ke baad kisi ko gher kar maar detii he
 Crowd is at work everywhere
 vah kab kis afvaah ke aadhaar par kise gher legi or maar degi pataa nahin
 Our colleague Srinivasan Jain's 'truth vs Hype' explores that not only whatsapp is behind such rumors, but also the media at the local level gives the impression of such rumors as news, due to which people His credibility increases
 shruti menon kii dhule se report bataati he ki raashid naam ke vyakti ne is tarah kii afvaah kaa video capsule banaakar media live channel par chalaaya tha, jisamen aisi soochna police ko dene kii baat kahi gai thi
 The same news is from Jharkhand that such reports have appeared in local newspapers

 However, after 18 days, he is also out on bail and is in his house
 itani aasaani se bel milane ko lekar bhi sawaal uth rahe hai
 The police has not mentioned the communal clashes in this case
 police ne motorcycle ko lekar jhagada bataaya he
 But Qasim along with Samuddin's brother said that he was murdered on suspicion of beef
 uske parivaar ko dhamkee di gai ki jab tak shikaayat par dastakhat nahin karegaa bhai se milane nahin diya jayega
 While Bell's order states that in the police case, it was attributed to anger at the time of road rage
 magar cese diary main likhaa he ki gau hatya ko lekar maamla bhadkaa tha
 Police say that he has the statement of Samuddin but he has not given any statement
 'truth vs Hype' kii mariyam ne ye sab pataa lagaaya he
 The family members of Qasim said that Qasim used to do goat business
 gaay kaa nahin
 When Maryam spoke to the main accused, he is clearly saying that there was a fight over beef
 kabhi bhi kahin bhi bheed ban ja rahi he
 He has taken the law into his own hands
 is bheed ke pattern ko samajhnaa itnaa bhi mushkil nahin he
 The Prime Minister was meeting in Midnapore, West Bengal today, the canopy next to his stage fell
 pradhanmantri vahaan shanti se khadey rahane kii apil karte rahe or khud bhi sanyamit rahe
 Forty people were rushed to the hospital
 pradhanmantri ke liye aae ambulance ko bhi is kaam main laga diya gaya
 Ideally, such an incident in the Prime Minister's Assembly should be considered a security lapse
 ab jo aap dekh rahe hai, use antim baar ke liye bilkul nahin dekh rahe hai
 These pictures are from West Bengal
 pradhanmantri kii sabha main log pahunch nahin paae to gussa police waalon par nikaal diya
 Close to Kharagpur BJP supporters beat up the policeman

 At one place the soldier was killed by slippers

 Our country is really changing
 bheed apana kaam kar rahi he
 Now-a-days you will see such reports that the Dalit groom was not allowed to climb on the mare
 singh tital laga diya to uski pitayee kar di gai
 The Dalit groom demanded police protection to carry out his procession
 yah khabaren bataa rahi hai ki in naujavaanon ne apane liye jagah nahin maangi hoti to aap aaj bhi bhram main rahete ki jatvaad kaa zehar mit gaya he
 If the castes or castes who take pride in calling themselves domineering in the villages are not allowing the Dalits to take them to the procession, then imagine how much longer this struggle to wipe out the caste
 kya jati kaa adhikaar or ahankaar itnaa bada he ki sanvaidhanik adhikaar hasil karne ke liye uske saamne intazaar karnaa padegaa, usase ladanaa padegaa
 The procession of Sanjay Jatav which is coming behind the procession of the police would not have come out in this way if it had not taken the responsibility of writing a letter to the district administration, the Chief Minister and going to the High Court
 gaanv ke thakur dalit ke ghode par baithne ke khilaaf the
 He said that even if the Dalit had not sat on the horse till date, he would not sit still
 kya sanjay ko bagdhi par baithne se rokane vaali birdari khud ko kanoon or samvidhan se upar samajhati he
 It took six months for Sanjay to achieve this small freedom
 baad main prashasan ko gaanv ke chappe-chappe par police kii tainaati kerani padi or baraat nikali
 Those who were opposing the procession were even behind the intelligence agency
 gaanv ke jo log khud ko dabang samajhate hai unke paas yah takat kahaan se aati he ki duusare kii shaadi byaah main dakhal dene chale jate hai
 More than 30,000 Lekhpals in Uttar Pradesh open daily news channels in the hope that there will not be a Hindu Muslim debate today, there will be talk on their strike
 ve teen july se apni maangon ko lekar upi ke alag alag zilon main rose das baje se lekar 4 baje tak dharna pradarshan karte hai
 The accountant is now able to understand that the number of 30 thousand is not enough
 unki hadtaal ko 13 din ho chuke hai or maange maani jaaengi yaa nahin kisi ko pataa nahin he
 On this pretext, we first know what Lekhpal works and then show where we work
 mukhya rup se ye patawaari yaa amin kaa kaam karte hai yani zamin kii paimaaish kaa kaam inhen ko karnaa hota he
 More than 40 works are done and these are the accountants who know the documents of about one lakh villages of UP
 block offis se aapke kheton tak janaa, zamin ke vivaad main inaki bhoomika bahut ahm hoti he
 It is also their job to measure the land for government schemes and remove them from their possession
 iske alaava kitni fasal boi gai, kitni fasal hui iske aankade taiyaar karne kaa kaam bhi lekhpal kaa he
 The income caste residence certificate is given by the accountant only
 kul milakar zile main prashasan kaa upar se chalaa aadesh lekhapaalon ke paas hi jaakar rukta he
 There is no one below them
 tahseelon main lekhpal kis halaat main kaam karte hai aap iskaa andaaza video se kar sakate hai
 We asked for videos from many places, most of which were sent by Lekhpal
 zamin par jajim bicha kar kaam karte hai
 Work under a dilapidated building
 kamare main pankhaa tak nahin hota he
 If they sit under the tree, there is no place to sit
 inke liye shauchalay kam hi jagah par bane hai
 Where there are no cleanliness
 aap lekhapaalon ke kaam karne kii jagahon par jaaenge to pataa chalegaa ki prashasan na sirf jitna krur janata ke prati ho saktaa he utana hi apane bheetar ke logon ke saath bhi ho saktaa he
 Through this video, you are sitting at home watching how and where the administration works in the district
 hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ne varanasi main dharna par baithe lekhapaalon se baat kii
 Ajay said that the lekhpal has been sitting on a dharna for 13 days with his eight-point demands
 chaar maheene pehle mukhyamantri se bhi mulaakaat kar apni maangon ke bare main bataaya tha magar koi sunwaayee nahin hui
 The accountant wants a pay scale of 2800 instead of 2000
 2005 ke pehle kii pension kii yojana laag hogi
 Increase in allowances is very important, because sometimes accountants work by putting money from their pocket
 lekhapaalon ko awaas bhatta 480 rupee maheenaa miltaa he jo ki bahut kam he
 Really very little
 prati din kaa yatra bhatta 3 rupee 33 paise he, kis hisaab se he unhen bhi samaj nahin aata
 Stationary allowance is also 3 rupees 33 paise per day
 aaj kal shikaayatein online aane lagi hai
 For this, they have to go to cyber cafes
 tippaniyan Lekhpal wants him to be given a laptop or smart phone so that he can do his work
 is tarah se prashasan kii yah nichali kadi apane sammaan kii ladaai lard rahi he
 They are sad that the media does not show their fight but the Lekhpal should also ask himself what kind of channels he was watching before going on strike
 channelon par kya dekh rahe the
 It will happen that you see Hindu Muslims on the channels throughout the year and when you go on strike, the channels start doing journalism
 in khabaron se guzarate hue aapako jo bharat dikhaa kya uskaa samaadhaan hindu muslim dibet main hai, kabhi to aap khud se or dusron se puuchhenge ki ye bahes kab tak chalegi or kyon har duusare din channelon par chalati he,ye nahin puch sakate to yahi puch lijie ki ye bheed kya aapke ghar aa jaaegi to aap kya karenge

 Most children and teenagers are seen in the crowd that surrounded Qasim in Hapur of UP
 in tak afvaah pahunchi ki inhone gaay ko maar diya he
 Later, this picture of the police dragging Kasim was also revealed, for which the UP Police had apologized
 police ne is maamle main 4 logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 Yudhishthir Singh Sisodia has been made the main accused
 vaise 18 dinon baad vah zamaanat par baahar bhi he or apane ghar main he
 Questions are also being raised about getting the vine so easily
 police ne is maamle main sampradayik jhagade kaa zikr nahin kiya he
 Police has said a quarrel over the motorcycle
 lekin kasim ke saath samuddin ke bhai ne bataaya ki uski hatya gaumance ke andeh main kii gai he
 His family was threatened that he would not be allowed to visit the brother until he signed the complaint
 jabaki bel ke aadesh main likhaa he ki police cese main ise road rej yani sadak durghatana ke samay gusse ko kaaran bataaya gaya
 But in the case diary it is written that the case was instigated on cow slaughter
 police kahati he ki uske paas samuddin kaa bayaan he magar usne koi bayaan hi nahin diya he
 Mary of 'truth vs Hype' has discovered all this
 kasim ke parivaar waalon ne kaha ki kasim bakrii kaa bijness karata tha
 Not cow's
 mariyam ne mukhya aaropee se baat kii to vah saaf-saaf kah rahaa he ki gau maance ko lekar hi jhagada hua tha
 Anytime anywhere a crowd is being formed
 usne kanoon ko apane haath main le liya he
 It is not so difficult to understand this crowd pattern
 pradhanmantri aaj pashchim bengal ke midanapur main sabha kar rahe the, unke manch ke bagal kaa shaamiyana gir gaya
 The Prime Minister appealed to stand there peacefully and remained restrained himself
 chalis logon ko aspataal pahunchaaya gaya
 An ambulance for the Prime Minister was also put in this work
 kaayade se pradhanmantri kii sabha main aisi ghatana ko suraksha main chook mana janaa chahie
 Now what you are seeing is not watching at all for the last time
 ye tasviren pashchim bengal se hai
 If people could not reach the Prime Minister's meeting, then the angry policemen fired at them
 khadgpur ke kareeb bijepi samarthakon ne police vaale kii pitayee kar di
 Another soldier was run over by the mob
 ek jagah par sipaahi ko chappalon se maaraa gaya
 One additional SP has been injured
 hamaara desh vaaki badal rahaa he
 The crowd is doing its job
 aaj kal aap aisi khabaren kaaphi dekhte honge ki dalit duulhe ko ghodi par chadhane nahin diya gaya
 When Singh was given the title, he was beaten
 dalit duulhe ne apni baraat nikaalane ke liye police suraksha kii maang kii
 It is reported that if these youth had not asked for a place for themselves, you would have been confused even today that the poison of casteism has been erased
 agar gaanvon main khud ko dabang kahalaane main garv mahasoos karne vaali jati yaa jatiyaan daliton ko baraat tak nikaalane nahin de rahi hai to sochie jaat paat mitaa dene kaa yah sangharsh abhi or kitna lanbaa he
 Is the caste right and arrogance so great that to get constitutional rights, it will have to wait in front of it, will have to fight it
 police kii baraat ke peeche jis sanjay jatav kii baraat aa rahi he wo is tarah se nahin nikalati agar usne zila prashasan, mukhyamantri ko patr likhane se lekar hoicourt jane kaa jhamela nahin mol liya hota
 The Thakurs of the village were against sitting on a horse of a Dalit
 unka kahana tha ki aaj tak dalit ghode par nahin baitha to ab bhi nahi baithegaa
 Does the community, which prevents Sanjay from sitting on the bag, consider themselves above the law and the constitution
 chah maheene lag gaye sanjay ko is choti si azaadi ko hasil karne main
 Later, the administration had to deploy the police at the village level and the procession came out
 jo log baraat kaa virodh kar rahe the unke peeche khufia agency tak lagaai gai
 Where do the people of the village who believe themselves to be domineering, come from where the power goes to interfere in the marriage of another
 uttar pradesh main 30,000 se adhik lekhpal rose news channel is ummid main kholte hai ki aaj hindu muslim dibet nahin hoga, unke hadtaal par baat hogi
 From July 3, they hold a sit-in demonstration in different districts of UP daily from 10 am to 4 pm
 lekhpal ab samaj paa rahe hai ki 30 hazaar kii sankhya hi kaaphi nahin hoti he
 It has been 13 days for their strike and no one knows if the demands will be made or not
 isi bahaane pehle ham jaanate hai ki lekhpal kaam kya karte he or phir dikhaaenge kahaan kaam karte hai
 They mainly do the work of patwari or amin i
e
 they have to do the job of measuring the land
 40 se bhi adhik kaam hote he or upi ke kareeb ek lakh gaanvon ke dastavezon ke jaanane vaale yahi lekhpal hote hai
 Moving from the block office to your fields, their role in the land dispute is very important
 sarkari yojanaon ke liye zamin kii paimaaish kar unhen kabze se nikaalnaa bhi inkaa kaam he
 Apart from this, the work of preparing the data of how many crops were sown and how many crops were done is also with the accountant
 aay jati nivas ke pramaan patr lekhpal hi dete hai
 Overall, the administration's top order in the district stops with the accountants
 unke neeche koi he hi nahin
 Under what circumstances do Lekhpals work in tehsils, you can guess it by video
 hamane kai jagahon se video mangaayen, jinamein se zyaadaatar lekhpal ne hi bheje hai
 Jazim works by laying on the ground
 jarjar ho chuki imaarat ke neeche kaam karte hai
 There is not even a fan in the room
 ped ke neeche baithte hai to baithne kii bhi jagah nahin hoti he
 Toilets for these are made at very few places
 jahaan hai vahaan saaf safai kii koi vyavastha nahin
 If you go to the places of work of the accountants, then you will know that the administration can not only be as cruel to the people as it can be to the people within them
 is video ke zarie aap ghar baithe dekh rahe hai ki zilo main prashasan kaise or kahaan se kaam karata he
 Our colleague Ajay Singh spoke to the accountants sitting on the dharna in Varanasi
 ajay ne bataaya ki apni aath sutri maangon ko lekar lekhpal 13 dinon se dharne par baithe hai
 Four months ago, he also met the Chief Minister and told about his demands but no hearing was held
 lekhpal chaahate hai ki 2000 kii jagah 2800 kaa pe scale mili
 Pension plans prior to 2005 will be applicable
 bhatton main vruddi bahut zaruri he, kyonki kai baar lekhpal apni jeb se paise lagaakar kaam karte hai
 Lekhpalas get a housing allowance of Rs 480 per month, which is very low
 vaaki bahut kam he
 The travel allowance per day is 3 rupees 33 paise, according to which they do not even understand
 steshnari bhatta bhi 3 rupee 33 paise prati din he
 Nowadays, complaints have started coming online
 iske liye inhen sibar cafe main janaa padataa he
 The comments lekhpal chaahate hai ki unhen laptop yaa smart phone diya jaae taaki apana kaam kar saken
 In this way, this lower link of the administration is fighting for its honor

 Anytime anywhere a crowd is being formed
 usne kanoon ko apane haath main le liya he
 It is not so difficult to understand this crowd pattern
 pradhanmantri aaj pashchim bengal ke midanapur main sabha kar rahe the, unke manch ke bagal kaa shaamiyana gir gaya
 The Prime Minister appealed to stand there peacefully and remained restrained himself
 chalis logon ko aspataal pahunchaaya gaya
 An ambulance for the Prime Minister was also put in this work
 kaayade se pradhanmantri kii sabha main aisi ghatana ko suraksha main chook mana janaa chahie
 Now what you are seeing is not watching at all for the last time
 ye tasviren pashchim bengal se hai
 If people could not reach the Prime Minister's meeting, then the angry policemen fired at them
 khadgpur ke kareeb bijepi samarthakon ne police vaale kii pitayee kar di
 Another soldier was run over by the mob
 ek jagah par sipaahi ko chappalon se maaraa gaya
 One additional SP has been injured
 hamaara desh vaaki badal rahaa he
 The crowd is doing its job
 aaj kal aap aisi khabaren kaaphi dekhte honge ki dalit duulhe ko ghodi par chadhane nahin diya gaya
 When Singh was given the title, he was beaten
 dalit duulhe ne apni baraat nikaalane ke liye police suraksha kii maang kii
 It is reported that if these youth had not asked for a place for themselves, you would have been confused even today that the poison of casteism has been erased
 agar gaanvon main khud ko dabang kahalaane main garv mahasoos karne vaali jati yaa jatiyaan daliton ko baraat tak nikaalane nahin de rahi hai to sochie jaat paat mitaa dene kaa yah sangharsh abhi or kitna lanbaa he
 Is the caste right and arrogance so great that to get constitutional rights, it will have to wait in front of it, will have to fight it
 police kii baraat ke peeche jis sanjay jatav kii baraat aa rahi he wo is tarah se nahin nikalati agar usne zila prashasan, mukhyamantri ko patr likhane se lekar hoicourt jane kaa jhamela nahin mol liya hota
 The Thakurs of the village were against sitting on a horse of a Dalit
 unka kahana tha ki aaj tak dalit ghode par nahin baitha to ab bhi nahi baithegaa
 Does the community, which prevents Sanjay from sitting on the bag, consider themselves above the law and the constitution
 chah maheene lag gaye sanjay ko is choti si azaadi ko hasil karne main
 Later, the administration had to deploy the police at the village level and the procession came out
 jo log baraat kaa virodh kar rahe the unke peeche khufia agency tak lagaai gai
 do the people of the village who believe themselves to be domineering , come from where the power goes to interfere in the marriage of another
 uttar pradesh main 30,000 se adhik lekhpal rose news channel is ummid main kholte hai ki aaj hindu muslim dibet nahin hoga, unke hadtaal par baat hogi
 From July 3, they hold a sit-in demonstration in different districts of UP daily from 10 am to 4 pm
 lekhpal ab samaj paa rahe hai ki 30 hazaar kii sankhya hi kaaphi nahin hoti he
 It has been 13 days for their strike and no one knows if the demands will be made or not
 isi bahaane pehle ham jaanate hai ki lekhpal kaam kya karte he or phir dikhaaenge kahaan kaam karte hai
 They mainly do the work of patwari or amin i
e
 they have to do the job of measuring the land
 40 se bhi adhik kaam hote he or upi ke kareeb ek lakh gaanvon ke dastavezon ke jaanane vaale yahi lekhpal hote hai
 Moving from the block office to your fields, their role in the land dispute is very important
 sarkari yojanaon ke liye zamin kii paimaaish kar unhen kabze se nikaalnaa bhi inkaa kaam he
 Apart from this, the work of preparing the data of how many crops were sown and how many crops were done is also with the accountant
 aay jati nivas ke pramaan patr lekhpal hi dete hai
 Overall, the administration's top order in the district stops with the accountants
 unke neeche koi he hi nahin
 Under what circumstances do Lekhpals work in tehsils, you can guess it by video
 hamane kai jagahon se video mangaayen, jinamein se zyaadaatar lekhpal ne hi bheje hai
 Jazim works by laying on the ground
 jarjar ho chuki imaarat ke neeche kaam karte hai
 There is not even a fan in the room
 ped ke neeche baithte hai to baithne kii bhi jagah nahin hoti he
 Toilets for these are made at very few places
 jahaan hai vahaan saaf safai kii koi vyavastha nahin
 If you go to the places of work of the accountants, then you will know that the administration can not only be as cruel to the people as it can be to the people within them
 is video ke zarie aap ghar baithe dekh rahe hai ki zilo main prashasan kaise or kahaan se kaam karata he
 Our colleague Ajay Singh spoke to the accountants sitting on the dharna in Varanasi
 ajay ne bataaya ki apni aath sutri maangon ko lekar lekhpal 13 dinon se dharne par baithe hai
 Four months ago, he also met the Chief Minister and told about his demands but no hearing was held
 lekhpal chaahate hai ki 2000 kii jagah 2800 kaa pe scale mili
 Pension plans prior to 2005 will be applicable
 bhatton main vruddi bahut zaruri he, kyonki kai baar lekhpal apni jeb se paise lagaakar kaam karte hai
 Lekhpalas get a housing allowance of Rs 480 per month, which is very low
 vaaki bahut kam he
 The travel allowance per day is 3 rupees 33 paise, according to which they do not even understand
 steshnari bhatta bhi 3 rupee 33 paise prati din he
 Nowadays, complaints have started coming online
 iske liye inhen sibar cafe main janaa padataa he
 The comments lekhpal chaahate hai ki unhen laptop yaa smart phone diya jaae taaki apana kaam kar saken
 In this way, this lower link of the administration is fighting for its honor
 media inaki ladaai nahin dikhaata he iskaa inhen dukh he magar lekhpal ko khud se bhi poochna chahie ki hadtaal par jane se pehle ve kis tarah ke channel dekh rahe the
 What were watching on the channels
 aisa to hoga ki aap saal bhar channelon par hindu muslim dekhen or jab hadtaal par jaaen to channel patrakarita karne lag jaaen
 Going through these news, the solution of what India has shown you is in the Hindu Muslim debate, sometimes you will ask yourself and others how long this debate will last and why it is running on the channels every other day, you cannot ask this What will you do if this crowd comes to your house? kabhi bhi kahin bhi bheed ban ja rahi he
 He has taken the law into his own hands
 is bheed ke pattern ko samajhnaa itnaa bhi mushkil nahin he
 The Prime Minister was meeting in Midnapore, West Bengal today, the canopy next to his stage fell
 pradhanmantri vahaan shanti se khadey rahane kii apil karte rahe or khud bhi sanyamit rahe
 Forty people were rushed to the hospital
 pradhanmantri ke liye aae ambulance ko bhi is kaam main laga diya gaya
 Ideally, such an incident in the Prime Minister's Assembly should be considered a security lapse
 ab jo aap dekh rahe hai, use antim baar ke liye bilkul nahin dekh rahe hai
 These pictures are from West Bengal
 pradhanmantri kii sabha main log pahunch nahin paae to gussa police waalon par nikaal diya
 Close to Kharagpur BJP supporters beat up the policeman
 ek or sipaahi ko bheed ne dauda liya
 At one place the soldier was killed by slippers
 ek adishnal espi ghayal hue hai
 Our country is really changing
 bheed apana kaam kar rahi he
 Now-a-days you will see such reports that the Dalit groom was not allowed to climb on the mare
 singh tital laga diya to uski pitayee kar di gai
 The Dalit groom demanded police protection to carry out his procession
 yah khabaren bataa rahi hai ki in naujavaanon ne apane liye jagah nahin maangi hoti to aap aaj bhi bhram main rahete ki jatvaad kaa zehar mit gaya he
 If the castes or castes who take pride in calling themselves domineering in the villages are not allowing the Dalits to take them to the procession, then imagine how much longer this struggle to wipe out the caste
 kya jati kaa adhikaar or ahankaar itnaa bada he ki sanvaidhanik adhikaar hasil karne ke liye uske saamne intazaar karnaa padegaa, usase ladanaa padegaa
 The procession of Sanjay Jatav which is coming behind the procession of the police would not have come out in this way if it had not taken the responsibility of writing a letter to the district administration, the Chief Minister and going to the High Court
 gaanv ke thakur dalit ke ghode par baithne ke khilaaf the
 He said that even if the Dalit had not sat on the horse till date, he would not sit still
 kya sanjay ko bagdhi par baithne se rokane vaali birdari khud ko kanoon or samvidhan se upar samajhati he
 It took six months for Sanjay to achieve this small freedom
 baad main prashasan ko gaanv ke chappe-chappe par police kii tainaati kerani padi or baraat nikali
 Those who were opposing the procession were even behind the intelligence agency
 gaanv ke jo log khud ko dabang samajhate hai unke paas yah takat kahaan se aati he ki duusare kii shaadi byaah main dakhal dene chale jate hai
 More than 30,000 Lekhpals in Uttar Pradesh open daily news channels in the hope that there will not be a Hindu Muslim debate today, there will be talk on their strike
 ve teen july se apni maangon ko lekar upi ke alag alag zilon main rose das baje se lekar 4 baje tak dharna pradarshan karte hai
 The accountant is now able to understand that the number of 30 thousand is not enough
 unki hadtaal ko 13 din ho chuke hai or maange maani jaaengi yaa nahin kisi ko pataa nahin he
 On this pretext, we first know what Lekhpal works and then show where we work
 mukhya rup se ye patawaari yaa amin kaa kaam karte hai yani zamin kii paimaaish kaa kaam inhen ko karnaa hota he
 More than 40 works are done and these are the accountants who know the documents of about one lakh villages of UP
 block offis se aapke kheton tak janaa, zamin ke vivaad main inaki bhoomika bahut ahm hoti he
 It is also their job to measure the land for government schemes and remove them from their possession
 iske alaava kitni fasal boi gai, kitni fasal hui iske aankade taiyaar karne kaa kaam bhi lekhpal kaa he
 The income caste residence certificate is given by the accountant only
 kul milakar zile main prashasan kaa upar se chalaa aadesh lekhapaalon ke paas hi jaakar rukta he
 There is no one below them
 tahseelon main lekhpal kis halaat main kaam karte hai aap iskaa andaaza video se kar sakate hai
 We asked for videos from many places, most of which were sent by Lekhpal
 zamin par jajim bicha kar kaam karte hai
 Work under a dilapidated building
 kamare main pankhaa tak nahin hota he
 If they sit under the tree, there is no place to sit
 inke liye shauchalay kam hi jagah par bane hai
 Where there are no cleanliness
 aap lekhapaalon ke kaam karne kii jagahon par jaaenge to pataa chalegaa ki prashasan na sirf jitna krur janata ke prati ho saktaa he utana hi apane bheetar ke logon ke saath bhi ho saktaa he
 Through this video, you are sitting at home watching how and where the administration works in the district
 hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ne varanasi main dharna par baithe lekhapaalon se baat kii
 Ajay said that the lekhpal has been sitting on a dharna for 13 days with his eight-point demands
 chaar maheene pehle mukhyamantri se bhi mulaakaat kar apni maangon ke bare main bataaya tha magar koi sunwaayee nahin hui
 The accountant wants a pay scale of 2800 instead of 2000
 2005 ke pehle kii pension kii yojana laag hogi
 Increase in allowances is very important, because sometimes accountants work by putting money from their pocket
 lekhapaalon ko awaas bhatta 480 rupee maheenaa miltaa he jo ki bahut kam he
 Really very little
 prati din kaa yatra bhatta 3 rupee 33 paise he, kis hisaab se he unhen bhi samaj nahin aata
 Stationary allowance is also 3 rupees 33 paise per day
 aaj kal shikaayatein online aane lagi hai
 For this, they have to go to cyber cafes
 tippaniyan Lekhpal wants him to be given a laptop or smart phone so that he can do his work
 is tarah se prashasan kii yah nichali kadi apane sammaan kii ladaai lard rahi he
 They are sad that the media does not show their fight but the Lekhpal should also ask himself what kind of channels he was watching before going on strike
 channelon par kya dekh rahe the
 It will happen that you see Hindu Muslims on the channels throughout the year and when you go on strike, the channels start doing journalism
 in khabaron se guzarate hue aapako jo bharat dikhaa kya uskaa samaadhaan hindu muslim dibet main hai, kabhi to aap khud se or dusron se puuchhenge ki ye bahes kab tak chalegi or kyon har duusare din channelon par chalati he,ye nahin puch sakate to yahi puch lijie ki ye bheed kya aapke ghar aa jaaegi to aap kya karenge
 Now what you are seeing is not watching at all for the last time
 ye tasviren pashchim bengal se hai
 If people could not reach the Prime Minister's meeting, then the angry policemen fired at them

 isi bahaane pehle ham jaanate hai ki lekhpal kaam kya karte he or phir dikhaaenge kahaan kaam karte hai
 They mainly do the work of patwari or amin i
e
 they have to do the job of measuring the land
 40 se bhi adhik kaam hote he or upi ke kareeb ek lakh gaanvon ke dastavezon ke jaanane vaale yahi lekhpal hote hai
 Moving from the block office to your fields, their role in the land dispute is very important

 Apart from this, the work of preparing the data of how many crops were sown and how many crops were done is also with the accountant
 aay jati nivas ke pramaan patr lekhpal hi dete hai
 Overall, the administration's top order in the district stops with the accountants
 unke neeche koi he hi nahin
 Under what circumstances do Lekhpals work in tehsils, you can guess it by video
 hamane kai jagahon se video mangaayen, jinamein se zyaadaatar lekhpal ne hi bheje hai
 Jazim works by laying on the ground
 jarjar ho chuki imaarat ke neeche kaam karte hai
 There is not even a fan in the room

 Toilets for these are made at very few places
 jahaan hai vahaan saaf safai kii koi vyavastha nahin
 If you go to the places of work of the accountants, then you will know that the administration can not only be as cruel to the people as it can be to the people within them
 is video ke zarie aap ghar baithe dekh rahe hai ki zilo main prashasan kaise or kahaan se kaam karata he
 Our colleague Ajay Singh spoke to the accountants sitting on the dharna in Varanasi
 ajay ne bataaya ki apni aath sutri maangon ko lekar lekhpal 13 dinon se dharne par baithe hai
 Four months ago, he also met the Chief Minister and told about his demands but no hearing was held
 lekhpal chaahate hai ki 2000 kii jagah 2800 kaa pe scale mili
 Pension plans prior to 2005 will be applicable
 bhatton main vruddi bahut zaruri he, kyonki kai baar lekhpal apni jeb se paise lagaakar kaam karte hai
 Lekhpalas get a housing allowance of Rs 480 per month, which is very low
 vaaki bahut kam he
 The travel allowance per day is 3 rupees 33 paise, according to which they do not even understand
 steshnari bhatta bhi 3 rupee 33 paise prati din he
 Nowadays, complaints have started coming online
 iske liye inhen sibar cafe main janaa padataa he
 The comments lekhpal chaahate hai ki unhen laptop yaa smart phone diya jaae taaki apana kaam kar saken
 In this way, this lower link of the administration is fighting for its honor

 What were watching on the channels
 aisa to hoga ki aap saal bhar channelon par hindu muslim dekhen or jab hadtaal par jaaen to channel patrakarita karne lag jaaen
 Going through these news, the solution of what India has shown you is in the Hindu Muslim debate, sometimes you will ask yourself and others how long this debate will last and why it is running on the channels every other day, you cannot ask this What will you do if this crowd comes to your house? mukhya rup se ye patawaari yaa amin kaa kaam karte hai yani zamin kii paimaaish kaa kaam inhen ko karnaa hota he
 More than 40 works are done and these are the accountants who know the documents of about one lakh villages of UP
 block offis se aapke kheton tak janaa, zamin ke vivaad main inaki bhoomika bahut ahm hoti he
 It is also their job to measure the land for government schemes and remove them from their possession
 iske alaava kitni fasal boi gai, kitni fasal hui iske aankade taiyaar karne kaa kaam bhi lekhpal kaa he
 The income caste residence certificate is given by the accountant only

 If they sit under the tree, there is no place to sit

 Where there are no cleanliness

 chaar maheene pehle mukhyamantri se bhi mulaakaat kar apni maangon ke bare main bataaya tha magar koi sunwaayee nahin hui
 The accountant wants a pay scale of 2800 instead of 2000
 2005 ke pehle kii pension kii yojana laag hogi
 Increase in allowances is very important, because sometimes accountants work by putting money from their pocket
 lekhapaalon ko awaas bhatta 480 rupee maheenaa miltaa he jo ki bahut kam he
 Really very little
 prati din kaa yatra bhatta 3 rupee 33 paise he, kis hisaab se he unhen bhi samaj nahin aata

 They are sad that the media does not show their fight but the Lekhpal should also ask himself what kind of channels he was watching before going on strike

 The case caught quite a lot, but now a similar incident happened with Raju Shetty, a MP from Maharashtra and leader of the self-respecting farmers association
 lekin is baar maamla saansad kii nahin balki jet airways kii laaparvaahee kaa he jisaki shikaayat saansad mahoday ne nagar vimaanan mantralay or upabhokta adaalat main karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Actually on Wednesday morning, Raju Shetty, a member of the Jet Airways flight, was supposed to come from Mumbai to Delhi, but the airlines left him at the airport and took off
 raju shetty kaa kahana he ki subah 6 baje baje kii flite ke liye vah 4 baje airport pahunch gaye the, unhone dilli jane ke liye boarding paas bhi liya tha, tabaudan main ek ghante kaa samay tha, isliye vah lounj main baithe the
 When he went for boarding 20 minutes earlier, the airline staff informed him about the boarding off
 bina raseed ke 2 hajaar rupye zyada vasuleraju shetty ko sansadeey samiti kii ahm baithak ke liye dilli aana tha lihaaza unhone adhikariyon ko jab apni samasya bataai to unhen 7 baje kii flite kaa tikat diya gaya, lekin iske liye unase 2 hajaar rupye zyada liye gaye
 Shetty did this with a payment card, but he was not even given a receipt from Jet Airways
 saansad shetty kaa kahana he ki ab tak wo gaekwad maamle main saansad ko hi galat maanate rahe lekin aaj airlines ne unke saath bina kisi galati ke jo bartaav kiya he usase yah lagata he kigaekwad ne jo kiya, vah sahi tha
 Jet Airways has also issued a statement on the cleanliness of the company
 company kaa kahana he ki raju shetty tay vakt tak boarding get par nahin pahunche the
 At the same time, he was given the option of another flight and the fee charged was refunded to him along with the apology
 ab yah baat saaf ho gai he ki kashmir main shahid huebhartiya sena ke karnal munindranath rayour pulicekarmi sanjivan singh ko dhokhe se maaraa gaya
 According to a newspaper, two militants were hiding in a house in Mindora village in Kashmir
 isaki soochna jab sena ko mili to vahaan ke commanding officer karnal raay apane sainikon ke saath pahunche
 Policeman Sanjeev Singh was also there to help him
 karnal raay ne puure ilaake kii gheraabandi kar di or ve chaahate the ki aatanki aatm samarpan kar den
 The family members of the terrorists said that they should not shoot at them and we will get them surrendered
 jab karnal raay ghar waalon se baatcheet kar hi rahe the to donon aatanki baahar nikal kar aae or unhone karnal or sipaahi par goli chalaani shuru kar di
 Both of them got fired but Colonel Rai acted immediately and opened fire on them, in which both the terrorists were killed
 sena mukhyalay ne bataaya ki karnal raay bahadur officer the or unhone vahaan ke nagarikon kii raksha ke liye pehle goliyaan nahin chalaai or aatankiyon se aatm samarpan karne ko kaha
 If they acted there, a large number of people would have been killed
 is tarah kii karrwai bahut samvedansheel hoti he
 Hence Colonel Rai himself decided to lead the troops
 ghar main chupe aatankiyon ke ghar vaale unase aatm samarpan ko kah rahe the or baatcheet chal rahi thi ki aatankiyon ne dhokhe se un par hamalaa kar diya
 This was confirmed by the army lieutenant general Subrata Saha in Srinagar
 dhokhe ke baavjood karnal or unki team ne teji se karrwai kii varanaa kai log hataahat hote
 The Army Headquarters stated that it was a battalion-level operation and was usually commanded by a commanding officer who is a colonel, or a second commander who is a lieutenant colonel

 Members of his family paid tribute to him at the crematorium ghat in Delhi Cantt area and laid floral cycles on his body

 Will these measures help the economy? Are the government's steps being taken in the right direction? This was discussed with the then Planning Commission (now NITI Aayog), former Principal Economic Advisor Pranab Sen, who had been associated for 15 years since 1994
 bhashaa ke unase ‘paanch sawaal' or unke jawaab is prakaar hai:america or china ke bich badhate vyapaarik tanaav ke asar ke bare main unhone kaha ki iskaa thodaa bahut asar ho saktaa he lekin panchavarshiya yojanaon kaa unka anubhav bataata he ki desh kii khud kii kshamta itani he ki saat pratishat kii aarthik vruddhi hasil kii ja sakati he
 But for this, it is necessary that the economically weaker section, which is rural India, demand should increase there

 BSP supremo Mayawati has disagreed with the statement of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat's Hindu nation
 unhone kaha ki babasaheb ambedkar ne dharmanirpekshata ke aadhaar par samvidhan banaaya tha
 While campaigning his party for the assembly elections due in Maharashtra on October 21, the former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister said that the current economic slowdown has come due to the failed policies of the Narendra Modi-led government
 unhone daawa kiya ki vipakshi party congress or sattarudh bhaajapa kii sarkari naukariyon main podannati ke liye daliton or anusuchit janajatiyon ke aarakshan ko rokane ke liye aantarik samaj he
 Mayawati said, "the laws made for the interests of Dalits and Scheduled Tribes have been neutralized by the government
 isse desh main vanchiton kaa shoshan karne waalon ko badhaava mila he
 He said that the condition of religious minorities in the country is also worrying
 basapa adhyaksh ne kaha, ‘‘haal hi main aresas pramukh ne ek bayaan main kaha tha ki is desh main muslim khush hai kyonki bharat ek ‘hindu raashtra' he
 The BSP does not agree with this statement
 aresas pramukh ko is tarah kaa bayaan dene se pehle sachhar samiti kii report padhani chahie
 Mayawati said, "we do not agree with the RSS chief's statement of Hindu Rashtra as Babasaheb Ambedkar did not prepare the constitution keeping Hindus in mind
" unhone dharmanirpekshata ke aadhaar par sabhi dharm ke logon kaa khyaal rakhaa tha
 "he said," India is a secular country and not a Hindu nation
 ''bataa den vijaydashami ke avasar par nagpur main yojit ek kaarykram ko sambodhit karte hue aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ne kaha tha ki jo bharat ke hai, jo bhartiya purvajon ke vanshaj hai va sabhi vividhtaon kaa sweekaar, sammaan va swaagat karte hue aapas main miljul kar desh kaa vaibhav va maanavtaa main shanti badhaane kaa kaam karne main jute jate hai ve sabhi bhartiya hindu hai

 After getting hurt on many issues, now the Congress has also understood the importance of this social network
 desh kii sabase puraani, sabase badi or shaayad sabase hathdharmi raajnneetik party ne digvijay singh ke netritv main 10 sadasyon vaali sanchaar or prachaar samiti cameti banaai he
 Apart from him, it includes Manish Tiwari, Ambika Soni, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Deepender Hadda, Rajeev Shukla, Bhakta Charan Das, Anand Adkoli, Sanjay Jha and Vishwajit Singh
 unki bhi jangi yojana taiyaar ho chuki he or ab maidan main utarane ke liye aalaa kaman kii ore se hari jhandi milane kaa intjaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Digvijay Singh says, "the importance of social media can no longer be denied
 ” is group kii mukhya yojana yah he ki desh bhar main yuva congress or neshnal students union of india (enesuai) jaise apane sanghathanon se kaaryakartaaon ko golband kiya jaae or uskaa niyantran party ke netaaon kii ek mukhya team ke haath main diya jaae
 It is clear that the Congress needs to improve its image on social media
 iskaa saboot haal hi main kai maukon par dekha gaya
 For example, the arrest of Owaisi on 8 January following Akbaruddin Owaisi's hate speech spread quickly on youtube, the anti-corruption movement led by Anna Hazare, the top trending Twitter trend in the world for several days in 2011, and December In 2012, the movement against Delhi gang rape, which took widespread form due to the public comments on social media forums
 kendriya soochna-prasaaran mantri manish tiwari kehete hai, “ab nae badlaav ke mahatv ko samaj liya gaya he
 We have accepted that Facebook, Twitter and youtube can be a political medium
 yah party ke hit main he ki ham is nai takneekee ke mahatv ko samajhen
 "the Congress says that this is not just a strategic decision to be taken keeping in mind the general elections next year, but also a big decision for it beyond that
 is tarah ke bayaan congress kii shuruaati pratikriya se ekadam ulat hai
 She has been responding to the growing influence of social media through measures such as censorship, account blocking and websites being banned
 march, 2011 main nai dilli main ek maukey par sanchaar or soochna praudyogiki mantri kapil sibbal ne soshal media kaa upyog karne waalon se apil kii thi ki ve iske khataron ko samajhen—“abhivyakti kii aazaadee kii kuch simaaen hai
 How will you ensure that these sites will be able to maintain those precautions? " But Tiwari, who had removed his Twitter account twice before due to online misuse, is now taking a slightly different approach
 ve iske sakaaratmak pahaluon par dhyaan dete hue kehete hai, “shuruaati daur main chal rahe is madhyam ke istemaal ke kuch niyam ban jaaenge
 According to the latest data from the Internet and Mobile Association of India, the social media agenda setting, currently 13 in India
 7 karod log internet kaa istemaal karte hai, 6
 There are 8 crore Facebook accounts and 1
 8 karod twitor aaidi hai
 It has become the first source of information for many people
 ek baat tay he ki soshal media kaa sidhaa asar mukhya dhara ke media par pad rahaa he
 Many times its impact is so high that it becomes a carrier of social change
 raajnneetik hathiyaar ke rup main soshal network kaa mahatv do mukhya binduon par nirbhar karata he
 First, the country's middle class, which felt it could not change the election results (banker Meera Sanyal's defeat from South Mumbai in 2009 proved it), and embraced the Internet as an alternative battleground
 
 fasebuk or twitor ab uske liye nae manch ban gaye hai, or samachar tivi studio uske liye sansad kaa rup le chuke hai
 Recently columnist Thomas Friedman in The New York Times wrote that what he saw on his latest tour of India was a unique experience for him — a completely new political fraternity, India's virtual middle class
 fredman ne paaya ki yah varg haalanki ab bhi kamjor he, lekin vah madhya varg se jude adhikaron kii maang kar rahaa he
 The second is by giving information through social media
 isse use apni raay kisi sampadak yaa tivi ankar ke jariye dene kii jarurat nahin hoti, or is tarah vah sampadak kii kaant-chhaant ke bina hi berokatoke apni baat dusron tak pahunchaa saktaa he
 Tiwari says, "you communicate directly with people
 jaahir he, iske apane phaayde hai
 "but another big thing is coming out
 vah yah ki raajnneetik partiyaan bhi mukhyadhara ke media main apana agenda banane ke liye iskaa istemaal kar sakati hai
 For example, in the morning of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's meeting with President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan in April 2012, @pmoindia posted a photo of the lunch table
 bas kya tha, media ne use aadhaar banaakar samachar bananaa shuru kar diya or sarkaar ke pravaktaa se sawaal par sawaal puche jane lage ki kashmiri vyanjan parosa ja rahaa he yaa nahin?upie ke ek sutara ke anusaar, “vaastavik mudda peeche rah gaya, jab tak ki donon mulkon ke pramukh bayaan dene ke liye taiyaar nahin ho gaye
 "although, unlike the activities of US President Barack Obama's White House site, @pmoindia's account work is limited to information, sources say the site could take a political turn as the election draws near
 soshal media kaa chaturaai se istemaal karnaa ek kala he

 The BJP believes that its popularity on the Internet will go a long way in expanding the urban vote bank during the 2014 general election
 party ke sutron kaa kahana he ki iskaa saboot dilli or mumbai main dikhaai degaa, jahaan congress ko 2009 main sabhi 13 siton par jeet mili thi
 Gupta denies that his unit fills the Internet with right-wing propaganda, but he acknowledges that it can be used as a weapon for publicity among people

 They mix social media activities with election data

 “scrutinizing the data shows that there is a direct correlation between the activities on-line and the commotion at the polling booth

 The maximum number of 1,845 people expressed their support on Twitter, followed by 546 comments on Facebook

 According to the BJP, it shows that people have welcomed his appointment to the post of party president

 There are seats, computers are installed, there is an internet connection of 20 Mbps and there are charts on the boards
 gupta kehete hai ki ve swayamsevak hai, koi karmchaaree nahin
 But after being scrapped, he accepts that he gets a salary
 “yah hamaari jimmedaari banati he ki ve apana parivaar chalaa saken
 "so are they on contract and do they hold any position? "yes, they are paid appropriately

 Between the completion of 10 years of the Right to Information Act, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not participate in the annual conference of the Central Information Commission organized to discuss various issues related to this law
 sambodhit karte aae hai piem yaa presidentpaardarshita se jude vibhinn mudde ko lekar yojit hone vaale sammelan ke udghaatan samaaroh ko saal 2006 se yaa to raashtrapati yaa pradhanmantri sambodhit karte rahe hai
 The only exception is 2010
 pichley varsh koi sammelan nahin hua kyonki sarkaar ne mukhya chunaav ayukta ko niyukt nahin kiya tha jo aise sammelan ke aayojan kii taiyaariyon ko dekhte rahe hai
 The dates were changed for Modi, who said that Modi was invited to the conference and the dates were changed to October 16 instead of October 12, which could be in line with the pmo's schedule but later told he would not be able to attend 
 is sammelan main sevarat soochna ayukta, kaaryakarta, kanoonee visheshgy, buddhijivi hissaa lete hai or isse jude vibhinn vishyon par charchaa karte hai
 It is reported that to give equal benefit to reservation, the Modi government may divide the Other Backward Classes (OBC) into three groups
 ek angreji akhbaar ke mutabik, neshnal kamishan for becoward claces (NCBC) kendriya suchi main pichde varg kii teen group main baantne ke liye centre sarkaar kii sahmati kaa intjaar kar rahaa he
 This will limit the share of each group in the reservation of 27 per cent

 This causes harm to the most needy people in the Other Backward Classes
 'inkaa ekadhikarbataya jaataa he ki 'pichhadon ke bich agadon' ne 27 fisadi ke mandal kota par ekadhikaar jamaaya hua he
 Because the 'backward among the backward' are unable to compete with the backward class people with strong status due to their weak education and poor economic condition
 isi ke chalate anya pichhadaa varg ke logon ko teen samoohon main baantne kii pahal kii charchaa shuru hui
 The remarks made by Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar in the state of Maharashtra where people are suffering from famine and drought are objectionable and extremely embarrassing
 daavon kii 'baadh', magar pyaasi dharti, pyaase log
 
 
 Ajit Pawar, nephew of NCP chief and Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar, said in a meeting held in Pune, 'when will there be no water, what to do if there is no water in the dam
 unhone kaha ki bhukh hadtaal karne se pani nahin milegaa, kya pani-pani karte ho
 If there is no water in the river then what to pee
 ’boond-boond pani ke liye taras rahaa he maharashtraunhone kaha ‘ek aadmi 55 din se dam main pani chhodane kii maang ko lekar anshan kar rahaa he, kya use pani mila
 Now there is no water, so what to leave? Can you pee there now? ’vaah netaji vaah, asi kamare, bottleband pani, choubees ghante aishoaaraam
 What do you know what is the craving for a drop of water? aapako kya pataa bijli kii killat kya hoti he
 In the narrow streets, show one day in the scorching heat with no water and no fan
 vaise aapako isaki jarurat bhi nahin or jo janata majaboor he, wo rahe unki bhalaa se
 Wajid Ali Shah, the last Nawab of Awadh, became more famous in history because of his art, music lover and his luxurious lifestyle than a skilled ruler
 unki aisi chhavi ke peeche koun se kaaran jimmedaar the? kya sachmuch main waajid hameshaa kanijon se ghire rahete the? kya unke man main mahilaon ke liye sammaan nahin tha? aise hi tamaam sawaal itihaas main dilchaspee rakhane vaale har shakhas ke man main uthte hai
 The interesting thing in this case is that Wajid himself has prepared the story of the first 26 years of his life in the form of a book
 life or travel ke bich kii duniya he sandip kii nai bukhaal hi main raajapaal and sans nai dilli se chhapakar ai kitaab ‘parikhana’ main waajid ali ke jivan ke us paksh kaa varnan he, jisamen unhone 26 varsh kii aayu tak anek mahilaon se apane prem prasangon, anubhavon or sangeet nrity se apane judaav kaa eemaandaaree se bayaan kiya he
 It is true that from a very young age, he started getting in touch with all the dance-dancers, khidmatgar kannis and women artists
 unamem se kaiyon ke saath unhone shaadi kii or kaiyon ko alag-alag begum ke kitaab se bhi nawaja
 To make such beautiful Begums stay and to train them to dance, they built 'parikhana'
 keval aath varsh kii umr main rahiman naam kii adhed mahila khidmatgaar ne pehali baar waajid ke man main aurat or mard kaa ahsaas karavaaya
 After this uncountable fairies and begums tried to make a place in Wajid's life and heart
 lekin unamem se kuch hi aisi thi jinase vastav main waajid ko bhi mohabbat hui yaa jinke liye unke dil main khaas jagah bani or jinke bichhadne par waajid roe bhi the
 It is a dream to reach the pinnacle in social life
 'modi Sutra Although this book is being promoted as a colorful tale of the last Nawab of Awadh, but this book also reveals the image of a completely different person within Wajid Ali Shah
 it occurs
 yahaan par sirf pyaar muhabbat hi nahin rishton kii penchidgiyaan bhi ujagar hui hai
 Countless women like Amiran, Umrao Khanam, Hazur Pari, Dildar Pari, Mehak Pari, Imaman, Hur Pari, Kaiser Begum, Khusro Begum and Begum Hazrat Mahal are present in this book
 bharat ke pratham swadhinata sangram main apni bhoomika ke liye prasiddh hui begum hazrat mahal bhi parikhana kii beghamon main shaamil thi
 Much has been written about him in this book
 kya aapaki bhi 'ishk kii dukaan band he'
 
 
 No matter what the image of Wajid Ali has been in history, but he was a sensitive man with a soft heart
 is kitaab main bhi apni gatividhiyon kaa zikr karne ke uddeshy ke bare main vah likhte hai ‘ is kitaab ko padane vaale swaarthee mahilaon se saavdhaan rahen or unpar kabhi yakeen na karen or na hi unpar apana paisa barbaad karen
 'A 26-year-old young man so eloquently and honestly narrating the unfolding episodes of his life not only for excitement or ridicule, but to reveal the truth behind his image, really proves the intelligence and ingenuity of the Nawab
 
 bhale hi yah kitaab waajid ali ke jivan ke atarang pakshon ko ujagar karti he lekin iske jariye us daur ke itihaas or samskruti kii bhi jhalak milti he
 In this sense, the historical importance of this book is also not less

 (input-ians) vitt varsh ke samaapt hone se pehle naukareepesha logon se companiyaan investment pruf maang rahi hai
 At the same time, there are many types of confusions among people
 adhiktar logon ko yah nahin samaj main nahin aa rahaa ki vah investment pruf main kya-kya de saktaa he
 So there are many people who are confused about standard deduction
 aaj ham is report main aapke is kanfusion ko dur karne vaale hai
 1
 sawaal - investment pruf kyon maang rahi companiyaan ?jawaab- darasal, investment pruf ke jariye companiyaan aapke dwaara tex bachaane ke liye kiye gaye investment kii jaankaree leti hai
 The company does this to save you from the hassle of paying more or less tax
 aise main ek nishchit taarikh tak aapako investment pruf kii copy apni company ko deni hogi
 If you do not do this, then your salary can be cut
 2
 Question- What can you give in investment proof? Answer - As an investment proof, you have to give a receipt for your life or health policy or tax saving investment
 vahiin kiraye ke makaan main rahane vaale logon ko ghar ke kiraye kii raseed jamaa karaani hoti he
 Apart from this, if you have taken a home loan, then the documents related to it will also have to be given to the company
 3
 Question- Can you pay tuition fees? Answer - As an investment proof, you can also submit a receipt for tuition fees of children
 lekin isaki kuch sharten bhi hai
 As a first condition, only the fees paid at the time of admission to a registered school, college or other educational institution with the Government of India or at any time in the financial year are valid for tax benefits
 iske alaava yah chhot sirf do bacchon kii skool fees tak hi simit he
 If both parents are in jobs, they can take advantage of this exemption in different ways
 kai baar abhibhavakon ko tution fees ke alaava bhi kai prakaar ke shulk jamaa karaane hote hai
 Explain that under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961, tuition fees are exempted from tax
 4
 Question - What is standard deduction? Answer- Standard deduction is that part of your annual income, on which you do not have to pay any tax
 is chhot kaa phayda uthaane ke liye aapse iskar vibhaag kisi bhi tarah kaa document bhi nahin maangata he
 Understand in easy language, you will not need to give any investment proof of up to Rs
 40 thousand discount under standard deduction
 5
 Question- How will the standard deduction be fixed? Answer- Standard deduction is a lump sum amount that is deducted from your total salary income and then the taxable income is calculated
 udhaaharan ke liye aapaki salanaa kamai 5 lakh rupee he to aap is rakam main se 40,000 rupee tak (5 lakh -40 hajaar = 4,60,000 ) kam kar len
 That is, your annual income of 4 lakh 60 thousand rupees is taxable
 aapako kitna standard didction milegaa, ye is par nirbhar karegaa ki aap tex slab ke kis daayre main aate hai
 Understand from this calculation Income - Rs
 5 Lakhs Standard deduction - Rs
 40,000 Rupeable income - Rs
 4,60,000 (rs
 5 Lakhs-40 thousand) Tax exemption - Rs
 2,50,000 - Rs
 4,60,000 - 2,50,000 = Rs
 2 Lakhs 10 thousand Rs
 
 sawaal- standard didction kaa kisko kitna phayda ?jawaab-aam bajet 2018 main 40 hajaar rupee ke standard didction ko lagu kiya tha
 Before the introduction of standard deduction, Rs 15,000 was given as medical allowance and Rs 19,200 as transport allowance
 ye donon milakar 34,200 rupee hote the
 Now reduce it from Rs 40 thousand of standard deduction, you only get the benefit of Rs 5800
 aasaan bhashaa main samajhen to aap agar 5 fisadi ke tex slab main aate hai to aapkaa tex sirf 290 rupee bachataa he
 At the same time, if you are paying 10 percent tax, then you will save Rs 1160, while paying 30 percent tax, you will be able to save Rs 1740
 bataa den ki iskaa phayda naukareepesha or pensionbhogiyon ko sabase zyada miltaa he

 India Today Group Chairman and editor-in-chief Arun Puri welcomed the same spirit of passing away in the inaugural address of the Youth Summit

 corporate sector kii aam bolchaal kii bhashaa main is bandobast kaa matlab raajnneetikon ke saath saudebaaji se he
 Birla says, "contrary to popular perception about liberalization, it has become difficult to negotiate with politicians and overcome the bureaucratic trap
 '' birla maanate hai, 'maahaul ke bandobast' main aditya birla samooh 'maahir nahin' he
 According to him, "we are gradually implementing expansion plans instead of paying 'facility fee' to get a big project
" 
 Yes, clearly the Birla group had to lose some opportunities to earn profits, but in the end we can sleep peacefully
 '' yuvaaon ko birla main ek aise diggaj kaarobaari kii jhalak dikhi jisane 1995 main apane pita kii maut ke baad 28 saal kii umr main 9,000 karod ru

 birla bataate hai, ''press ne mujhe gadhaa to nahin kaha par nicha dikhaane ke liye sab kuch kar diya
 The main season Go for Gold: a Champion Shows How to Am Right also featured a successful youngster who, like Birla, likes to stay away from the eyes of the common people

 Self-condemnation at the moment, Gambhir Chetan Bhagat at the second moment had their hands on the pulse of the audience in the most volatile sessions of the Youth Summit
 unhone yuvaaon ko dikhaaya ki ve unki bhashaa bolte hai or unheen kii kahani sunaate hai
 "I know that i will never win the Man Booker Prize but i will definitely win millions of hearts," Bhagat said, agreeing with the youthful noise
 ''ek ladki kii yah baat sunakar bhagat bhaunchak rah gaye jab usne kaha ki vah sirf unhen dekhne ke liye ai he or isse koi fark nahin padataa ki ve shaadishuda hai
 Thankfully, Bhagat survived the arrival of two 'injured lions' superstar cricketers Yuvraj Singh and Gautam Gambhir

 Gambhir said, "we will give them the same medicine

 Gambhir refused to give any answer in this regard and Yuvraj simply said, "I have not yet found the right partner

 open court main hi unhone kaha ki yah conference good friday ke din rakhi gai he, kyonki 24 hycourt ke chif justise bhi aaenge or kisi bhi tarah hycourt kaa kaam prabhavit naa ho
 The Chief Justice said all this to a woman lawyer who wanted the conference not to be on Good Friday, as it is Christmas for Christians
 is par chif justise ne us mahila ko purana itihaas bhi yaad dilaayaa
 He said that in 2007 when the judge conference was held, it was also Good Friday, whereas in 2009 this conference was held on the occasion of Independence Day
 iske alaava 2004 main valmiki jayanti ke din yah conference hui thi
 In such a situation, to say now that it should not happen on Good Friday, it is not right
 justise dattu ne naaraazgi jaahir karte hue kaha ki jab pehle kabhi is maamle ko nahin uthaaya gaya, to ab kyon
 Is it because he is holding this conference this time? unhone khuli court main hi kaha ki is conference main 24 hoicourt ke chif justise aaenge or yah vakt isliye sahi he, kyonki is din chhutti bhi he
 In such a situation, the work of the High Court will not be affected

 Janwar in Arab society is a rebellion at the door of a revolution
 iskaa aagaaj das maheene pehle tunisia main ekaek ubhare aakrosh ke saath hua tha
 Last Sunday it marked the first step to a future frame when the first free elections were held in Tunisia

 On 23 October, thousands of candidates from 80 political parties cast their claim in the new Constituent Assembly
 yah baat acchhee tarah se janchi-parkhi ja chuki he ki kranti koi tii party nahin he; or baghawat to or bhi nahin
 The peaceful power transfer in Tunisia and the war in neighboring Libya point to an old fact: the new system, which has replaced the old political system, has to make a difference
 ben ali samaj gaya tha ki usne apni praja ko bahut thag liya, so vah apana sona-chaandi bator agyatavaas main nikal liya
 Had it come out quietly, the Libyans would have presented Muammar Gaddafi with gold and silver, hostesses for him, and an evil Italian football team to his evil sons
 par sathiyaaya sanakee gaddaphi to libyiyon ko moose maanakar unhen kuchal dene par utaaru ho gaya
 i wonder why people are surprised at Gaddafi's death? What else do we expect from the rebels? Will they send Gaddafi a butter-toast in Brahma Murtha and an air ticket to Geneva? Lenin understood the dangerous romance of nostalgia, which was given to the elites by the elite, especially the media
 inaki chhadam smritiyon ko murtiman kar sakane kii is tabake kii kuwwat ko bhi vah samajhta tha
 Lenin knew that the aura of death could divert attention from real things

 Its leader Rashid Al Ngannucci has a clear vision: a sustainable and pluralistic democracy that promises to protect minorities and give women equal rights in education and employment

 This week, Jackie Shroff's Sahebzade Tiger Shroff debuted with Heropanti
 ab ve box offis kii daud main shaamil ho gaye hai
 There was a long wait to see this film and Tiger on screen
 film kii kahani koi chamatkaarik nahin
 Rootime is a love story
 film kaa treetment or fresh feces apil karte hai
 If Kriti's smile and naughty performance, Tiger's amazing action and dance is definitely worth the money
 diarector ko pataa tha ki tiger or kriti kii euaspy kya hai, unhone inhen chizon ko parade par dikhaane kii koshish kii he
 How much Damahiroopanti in the story is a remake of the Telugu film Parugu

 In which Bablu and Dimpy are ready to fight with every force for the sake of saving their love, and then bloodshed unabashedly
 samaaj ke thekedaaron or rishtedaaron se jang
 If you look at Bollywood's routine love story
 aapako puri film main pataa rahata he ki kahaan kya hone vaala he
 Heropanti does not encourage much on the story front

 They still have to work very hard on their dialogue delivery and acting
 film main kai jagah ve dialog bolte samay ekadam flats ho jate hai
 Expressions also do not match
 jahaan tak baat acshan or dance kii he to ve usamen maharathi hai
 In the film, where they act, whistling sounds are played, but they also speak in a very simple way with strong-whistling dialogue
 kriti senon charming hai or sambhaavnaaon se labarej bhi
 But this film was of Tiger
 donon kii chemistry bhi yaad rakhane laayak nahin he
 Prakash Raj gets overacting while acting
 unhen ab is image se baahar aana chahie
 The matter of earning which is crazy about action
 jinhen lavastories pasand he
 For those who have been appreciative of Tiger's physique and his dance and action, it is an absolutely spice film
 film kaa mujeec plus-point he
 The action is also amazing
 film yuvaaon or prem ras ke diwane bollywood premiyon ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaai gai he
 If Youth connects itself to the film, its success is guaranteed, if Tiger gets caught in a weak storyline, Tiger will find it difficult to "save" at the box office

 a little irritation makes the relationship spicy, but it is like the salt that spoils the taste when it gets too much
 agar aapkaa partner bahut adhik jalan karata he to ye aapke rishte ke liye acchhee baat nahin he
 2
 aapkaa partner aapke products or gols ke bare main kya sochataa he ? kya wo hi aapke liye saare faisle letaa he or aapako kya karnaa chahie kya nahin karnaa chahie, wo hi tay karata he? jorishta aapako robot bana de, usase jitani jaldi alag ho jaaie utana behatar he
 3
 aise partner sabase khatarnaak hote hai jinhen ye baar-baar yakeen dilaane kii jarurat hoti he ki aap usase pyaar karti hai
 You can do anything you want, but it is impossible to convince a person with insecurity of love
 4
 It is also very difficult to live with someone who expects perfection in everything
 jaruri nahin ki aap kaa comfort jone uske parfections ke hisaab se sahi hi ho
 But such people draw loopholes on everything, due to which the relationship of love also becomes a burden
 5
 If anything goes wrong on your partner, then it is better that you say it bye
 aise log gaiyr-jimmedaar or kamjor hote hai, jo apni galati sweekaar karne se darate hai
 Making allegations is the easiest thing for them
 aisa karke wo khud ko surakshit mahasoos karte hai
 6
 agar aapako yakeen he ki aapkaa partner aapse jhooth bolta he to jitani jaldi ho sake aap usase alag ho jaaen
 Lies, whether small or big, are lies and this is enough to make any relationship hollow

 Like the life of man, the life of society and nation is also an ever-evolving process
 isliye jis prakaar manushya apane jivan main sahi-galat nirnay letaa hua laabh-haani ke avasar nirmit karata he or sukh-dukh sahan karne ko vivash hota he usee prakaar prayek samaaj or raashtra bhi ek ikai ke rup main apane maardarshak-siddhant or nitiyaan nirdhaarit karata hua laabh-haani kaa saamana karata he 
 Both man and society must keep evaluating their policies and practices properly at time to time
 haani sahakar bhi duraagrahpurvak ek hi li par aankh mundakar nirantar chalate rahanaa na to vyakti ke hit main hota he or na hi samaaj ke
 Therefore, it becomes not only necessary to review the predetermined policies and the work done in the past, but unfortunately many components of Indian politics, in the quagmire of party-interest-means for the attainment of private interests at the regional level, amend their mistakes
 Not ready to do it
 jammu kashmir rajya se sambandhit dhara 370 or 35-e ko hataae jane par vipakshi dalon kii pratikriyaayein is satya kii sakshi hai
 And now the reactions of eight regional parties from six states, including the country's most important opposition national party Congress, point to Home Minister Amit Shah's statement of 'one nation one language'
 yah ascharyajanak kintu dukhad satya he ki beesvin shatabdi ke chathe or saatven dashak main jis sattashin raajnneetik dal (congress) ne bahumat ke sahare manamaane nirnay lete hue anek aise samvidhan-sanshodhan kar liye jo samvidhan kii mul-bhaavana ke pratikul the, adhikanshat trutipurna the or desh kii ekta, akhandta or samprabhutaa ke liye hanikaarak the kintu ab jabaki tatkaaleen kamjor vipaksh aaj usee bahumat kii shakti se shaktishaalee hokar un traasad- sanshodhano ko punarikshit sanshodhit karnaa chahta he; kar rahaa he tab usee raajnneetik dal ke dwaara virodh kiya ja rahaa he
 It is a matter of satisfaction that many members of that party are also generously supporting the efforts of the ruling opposition party keeping in mind the interests of the country
 dalgat raajnneeti se upar uthakar rashtrahit main nitiyon ke parishkar-sanshodhan ke prati unki yah udaar sweekruti-sahmati spruhaniya he or hamaari swasth loktantric parampara ko drudh aadhaar pradaan karti he
 India is a democratic country
 The basis of our federal structure is a majority in which minority is always rejected before the majority, where governments fall when even a single vote is reduced
 In the middle of such a system this constitution should be amended as long as a single Hindi will not be declared as the national language till the non-hindi speaking state will protest
 To what extent was the majority judicious and democratic? Security had to go to the right? If the present government takes any new step to rectify the error in this context then it should certainly be welcomed
 ‘ek raashtra ek bhashaa’ kaa vichaar uparyukt truti ke sudhaar kaa sanket he
 Each political party has its own insistence, prejudice and prejudice
 inhen ke alok main dal apana raajnneetik kaarykram nishchit karata he or chunavi ghoshnaa patr taiyaar karata he tathaa satta main aata he
 The ground of change of power in central or states is formed from these points and different parties come to power and implement their announcements and programs
 is sthiti main paksh-vipaksh ke sankalpon - kaaryon main bhinnata hona swaabhaavik he
 It is both the duty and the responsibility of the party to deliver the promises, resolutions and declarations on the basis of the promises made in its manifesto on which a party comes to power
 yadi satta paksh is kartavya-daayitv kaa nirvaah karata he to vipaksh dwaara iske akaaran virodh kaa kya auchity he ?aakhir koi bhi vipaksh satta-paksh se yah aashaa-apeksha kyon karata he ki satta paksh uski banaai li par hi chalegaa apni nai rekha nahin khinchega? or yadi vartmaan athwa bhavishya kii sarkarein samaaj-virdohi rashtriya-hiton ke pratikul banaai gai roodhiyon kaa hi paripaalan karti rahengi to raashtra kii pragati or suraksha kaise sambhav hogi ?vishwa ke sabhi samprabhutaa sampann deshon main ek rashtrabhasha he
 Many dialects are spoken in each country and daily behavior takes place in the same dialects and languages and one of the languages which is considered to be the most important among them becomes a national language
 bharatvarsh ke atirikt anya sabhi rashtron main rashtrabhasha ke rup main kisi ek bhashaa kaa chayan sarvatha sahaj-swaabhaavik he jabaki bharat jaise samprabhutaa sampann vishwa ke sabase bade loktantric desh main rashtrabhasha kii sarvamaanya sweekruti swatantraaa prapti ke sattar varsh uparaant aaj bhi prashnaankit he; sankeern kshetreeyata parak maansikta kii swaarthsadhini vighatnkaaree raajnneeti kaa shikaar he
 It is automatically proven that India fought the freedom struggle against the British rule through the Hindi language
 gujarat , bengal, maharashtra jaise bade-bade praanton ke sabhi bade netaaon ne hindi ke madhyam se desh kaa netritv kiya or aaj bhi kar rahe hai
 The national-popularity of leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Subhash Chandra Bose and Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak is indebted to Hindi
 yadi gujarati bhashi mahatma gandhi keval gujarati bhashaa tak hi swayan ko simit rakhte to kya sampurna bharat ko prabhavit or prerit kar sakate the ? kya gujarati bhashi shri narendra modi hindi kaa aashray liye bina desh main itani lokapriyata arjeet kar sakate hai ?taatpary yah he ki is vishaal desh ke kisi bhi bhu-bhaag main janamen kisi bhi vyakti ko yadi rashtriya str par pratishthit hona he to use desh main sarvaadhik prayukt hone vaali bhashaa ko siikhnaa or sweekaar karnaa hi hoga
 In ancient India, Sanskrit was the most practiced language of India, and in modern India, Hindi is distinguished in place of Sanskrit
 aathvin shatabdi main kerala main janme multah malayalam bhashi shankaracharya sanskrit kii shakti se sanyukt hokar desh kii ekta or akhandta kii pratishtha kar sake; sampurna bharatvarsh ko saanskrithik sutara main piro sake tathaa beesvin shatabdi ke purvardh main netaaon ne hindi ke madhyam se raajnneetik chetana kii alakh jagaakar desh ko swatantraaa dilaayi
 At that time, there was no voice anywhere in opposition to Hindi
 ‘udant martand‘ jaisaa hindi kaa pratham samachar patr bengal kii dharti se prakashit hua to shraddharam fillori jaise hindi sevi punjab kii kokh se astitv main aae
 Maharishi Dayanand spread the light of his thoughts through Hindi, then Mahatma Gandhi through the 'rashtrabhasha Prachar Samiti', waved Hindi in the far south
 yah tathy kitna ascharyajanak he ki vartmaan grahamantri ke vaktavy ke viruddh ek swar main lamaband hone vaale ye vipakshi dal mahatma gandhi ko to maanate hai lekin mahatma gandhi kii hindi ke paksh main kahi gai baton ko maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 But why? Is Gandhi's message in favor of Hindi inconsistent, inappropriate and anti-national? If not, what is the objection in accepting them? In the context of making Hindi as the national language, this statement of Mahatma Gandhi is particularly reflexive - "whether you call Hindi Hindi or Hindustani, for me, both are the same
 hamaara kartavya yah he ki ham apana rashtriya kaary hindi bhashaa main karen
 "(speech: Quoted on 11 November 1917 in Muzaffarpur, World suktikosh-vol
 3, page 1317, Editor- Dr
 Shyam Bahadur Verma, publisher-prabhat Publication Delhi 110006 edition first 1985) - This hundred year old message of Mahatma Gandhi in his Why did the party's flag bearers not understand - this question is also worth considering? India is one from ancient times in cultural and religious terms
 uttar main himalay ke uttung shikharon par kedarnath main pratishthit bhagwaan bhootbhaavan shiv dakshin bharatiyon ke bhi upasya hai or sudur dakshin main sagar tat par sansthit rameswaram uttar bharatiyon ke liye bhi poojya hai
 Devotees take Ganga water from Gangotri and offer it to Rameswaram
 dwadash jyotirling or vaavan shaktipeethon ne sahastron varshon se bharatvarsh ko jod rakhaa he
 Our flag is one, our currency is one, our constitution is one, our great men are one, our religious texts are one - everything is the same, then why are we not one only on the question of language? What is the reason for our opposition to the most spoken and understood Hindi language in the country? It is beyond comprehension
 grahamantri ne hindi diwas ke avasar par dilli main yojit ek samaaroh main ‘ek raashtra ek bhashaa‘ kaa samarthan kiya he
 Here in a nation, if one language meant the end of other languages other than Hindi, then it certainly could not be acceptable, but if there is a question of choosing a language at the national and global level among all the other languages of the country, then it is a welcome Is worthy because we definitely need an Indian language to speak to the world
 aakhir yah samprabhutaa sampann suvishaal raashtra kab tak vishwa-patal par apni baat kisi videshi bhashaa main rakhata rahegaa ?kya apane deshavaasiyon ke samaksh apane desh kii bhashaa main apni baat rakhana athwa vishwa patal par kisi bhartiya bhashaa main bharat kaa paksh rakhana aatmgaurav kaa vishay nahin he ? kya yah uchit he ki ham jin angrejon ke gulam rahe hai unheen kii bhashaa kaa jua aazaadee ke baad bhi gale main daale rahen ?swatantra bharat ke pratham pradhanmantri ne yadi desh or vishwa ke str par samast bhartiya bhashaaon ko upekshit kar angreji ko variyata di to aaj bhi ham use hi apana sirmaur banaae rahe ? desh or vishwa ke str par aaj ek bhartiya bhashaa kii sarvamaanya sweekruti kii aavashyaktaa he or is aavashyaktaa kii purti bharat sarkaar kaa kartavya he
 It is pleasant that the present government is trying in this direction
 purv pradhanmantri atalbihari vaajapeyi kii bhashaa niti kaa aadar karte hue pradhanmantri narendra modi vishwamanch par hindi kii pratishtha hetu prayatnsheel hai
 Hindi is moving towards becoming a world language, but indiscriminate voices of Hindi protest within the country are still vocal
 tamilnadu kii dramuk, diemke or annadramuk aadi dalon ke netaaon ne kaha he ki unhen hindi sweekaar nahin he
 MDMK Chief Vaiko of Tamil Nadu has threatened that the country will split if Hindi is imposed in India
 puducheri ke mukhyamantri narayan swami ne bhi grahamantri ke vaktavy kaa shashakt virodh kiya he
 West Bengal's Trinamool Congress chief and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, along with their leftist parties, are also spewing venom against Hindi
 karnataka, kerala or telugana ke kshetreey dal bhi hindi ke virodh main hai jabaki hindi ke virodh kaa koi thos kaaran inamen se kisi ke paas nahin he
 It is sad that these states never oppose foreign language English
 angreji kii daastaa kaa mukut dhaaran karne main unhen koi aapatti nahin he kintu hindi kii swadeshi pagadi pahananaa inhen sweekaar nahin
 They are not afraid of English, they do not see any hindrance in the progress of their regional languages due to the increasing dominance of English
 angreji seekhney ko yah angreji kaa thopa janaa nahin maanate kintu hindi seekhney ko yah hindi kaa thopa janaa maanate hai uskaa virodh karte hai
 This opposition is not in the commercial, academic, literary, technical etc
 fields but only in political field, it is the product of the crooked intelligence of politicians
 bhartiya samvidhan kii duhai dene vaale in hindi virdohi rajanetaaon ke bhadakaau bayaan desh kii ekta or akhandta ke liye ghaatak hai
 The prestige of Hindi does not mean diminishing importance of regional languages
 yah vichaarneey he ki jab angreji uttar or dakshin ke madhya sethu ban sakati he to hindi yah kaary kyon nahin kar sakati? jab shaskeey kaaryon main angreji ke abaadh upyog se kshetreey bhashaaon kii koi haani nahin maani ja rahi to hindi ke badhate upyog se unako kya khatra ho saktaa he?ahindi bhashi rajyon ke jo netaa hindi ke virodh main har samay taal thonkate rahete hai, itane nadaan nahin hai ki uparyukt tathyon se anbhigya haa tathaapi ve kshetreey janamanas ko bhramit kar, usamen hindi ke viruddh kritrim bhay nirmit kar apni raajnneetik rotiyaan senkane main vyast hai
 This unfortunate situation is detrimental to not only Hindi but all Indian languages
 is vishavyaadhi kaa rambaan upachaar kendriya str par angreji ke varchasv ko hatotsahit kar uske sthaan par hindi ko santhaapit karnaa he
 As long as the English Rajrani remains in the center, Hindi will be able to get due respect in the north at the government and constitutional level and its acceptance will increase in the south
 yah alag baat he ki shashan dwaara vibhinn staron par upekshit hone ke baavjood hindi apni shakti se vishwa str par nirantar pratishthit hogi
 Hindi is Swayambha
 vah satta kii nahin janata kii bhashaa he or vyapak jansamarthan se sampann he
 The profanity-ridden speeches of so-called anti-hindi politicians of non-hindi speaking states may have slowed the pace of the spread of Hindi in some of their regions, but they do not have the ability to stop its growing footing globally
 kisi durbhagyapurna vicitra maansikta he jo ek ore vaishvikaran ke naam par har videshi bhav, vishay, vastu aadi ko sweekaar karne ke liye saharsha prastut he kintu duusari ore apane hi desh kii pramukhatam bhashaa hindi ko sweekaar karne se parhez karti he! kisi vidambnaa he ki videshon main hindi kaa varchasv bad rahaa he jabaki desh ke andar ek varg uski pragati main avrodh utpann karne main vyast he!amit shah ke hindi ke paksh main prastut vaktavy--‘bharat’ vibhinn bhashaaon kaa desh he or har bhashaa kaa apana mahatv he magar puure desh kii ek bhashaa hona atyant aavashyak he jo vishwa main bharat kii pahchaan bane
 Today, if any one language can do the work of tying the country to the door of unity, then Hindi is the most spoken language
 ‘-- kaa virodh karne vaali pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee or anya netaaon ko netaji subhash chandra bose kaa yah kathan samaran rakhana chahie ki ‘hindi ke virodh kaa koi bhi andolan raashtra kii pragati main baadhak he
 Therefore, acceptance of Hindi is necessary for the progress of the nation
 ‘‘nij bhashaa unnati ahai, sab unnati ko mul’’- bharatendu harishchandr kaa yah kathan vigat dedh sau varshon se nij bhashaa kii sweekaaryata kaa samarthan kar rahaa he
 The prestige of the local Indian languages at the state and regional level is the advancement of the personal language and along with it, the acceptance of Hindi as a private language at the national level is an urgent need today

 Mauni Amavasya means the day when the darkness of the person not only with the first rays of the sun, but also within the human body, goes away
 ganga yamuna kaa paavan jaldho detaa he sab paap or phir ugta heummido kaa nayaa savera
 It is said that on this day Manu Rishi was born and Mauni originated from the word Manu, hence this Amavasya is called Mauni Amavasya
 is vrath par maun dhaaran kaa vishesh mahatv mana jaataa he
 It is believed that the one who ends the fast by holding silence, attains the post of Muni

 Astrologers also believe that by taking a bath on this day, whoever meditates on Lord Shankar will worship them, their wishes will not be delayed
 milegaa janmon kaa punyavaise to is is din kisi bhi pavitra nadi main snaan kiya ja saktaa he lekin jo bhakt triveni ke sangam main snaan karte hai unhen sau hajaar rajasuya yajna ke baraabar fal kii prapti hoti he
 Taking a bath in Sangam and performing Ashwamedha Yajna on this day is the same
 lekin agar sangam yaa ganga yamuna main snaan nahin kar paayen to bhi koi baat nahin
 If you take bath in the Ganges water at home and worship the Sun God by law, you will bless the blessings of not only the fathers but also of the gods and you will get the blessings of many births

 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ko party adhyaksh pad kii kursi paane ke liye thodaa or intjaar karnaa pad saktaa he
 According to the schedule set for the organization elections, Rahul should have become president by the end of October, but now it seems difficult

 The election process should have been completed by the end of October according to the time set by the election authority, but given the sluggish pace, it seems unlikely
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke paas nae adhyaksh ke chunaav ke liye shedul maujuud he, jis par unako muhar lagaani he
 Then the Congress Working Committee will approve it and elections will be declared
 kaarysmiti kii baithak ke baad bhi lagbhag 10 se 12 din kaa vakt prakriya puri karne main lagegaa
 If Sonia wants, there can be many reasons to pull the coronation coronation till November
 vaise partydhyaksh sonia gandhiahen, to ye kaam vakt main bhi ho saktaa he
 Earlier there was discussion that after Diwali, election dates will be announced, but it has not been done so far
 party main ek raay yah bhi he ki rahul kaa chayan himachal pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav ke matdaan ke baad ho
 Some leaders also say that they are searching for auspicious time
 vajah chaahe jo bhi ho, lekin kaaphi vakt se adhyaksh pad par kabiz hone kaa rahul kaa sapana puraa hone main abhi or samay lagegaa
 Overall, Rahul's coronation process, which is completed by October 31, can now be pulled up to November
 aisi hogi rahul gandhi ke rajtilak kii puri prakriya- congress kaarysmiti kii baithak main chunaav ke shedul par muhar lagane ke baad adhyaksh pad ke chunaav ke liye tarikhon kaa elaan kar diya jayega
 - First nomination will happen, then nomination papers will be checked, after this time will be given for withdrawal of nomination and voting will take place only if there is more than one candidate
 - matdaan hone kii sambhaavna bahut hi kam he
 Because according to sources, only Rahul Gandhi will fill the nomination and due to lack of challenge, the only candidate Rahul Gandhi will be selected
 - is prakriya main 10 se 12 din yaa zyada vakt bhi lag saktaa he

 One of the few famous Hindu temples in Pakistan is the Katasaraja Temple which is a mythological and historical place
 kehete hai ki yaheen yaksha-yuddhishthir samvaad hua tha, yaheen devi sati kii agni samadhi ke baad bhagwaan shiv ke aansu gire the or vishwa prasiddh romaa sangeet kii utpatti kaa kshetra bhi yahi mana jaataa he
 The Katasraj Temple is located in the district Chakwal in the Punjab province of Pakistan
 yah lahore or islamabad motorve ke thik bagal main salt range kii mashhoor pahadiyon ke paas he
 Katasaraja has a famous lake and a series of temples that have a long history
 yahaan ke satgharaa mandiron ke samooh main sirf chaar mandiron ke avshesh bache hai jisamen bhagwaan shiv, ram or hanuman ke mandir hai
 Also there are Buddhist stupas, remnants of Jain temples and sites associated with Sikhism
 kehete hai ki yahaan par sikhon ke guru nanakdev or nath sampradaay ke sansthaapak gorakhnath bhi aae the
 It is believed that when Lord Shiva was deeply saddened by Sati's fire-tomb, his tears fell in two places
 ek se katasraj sarovar kaa nirmaan hua to duusare se pushkar kaa
 The word Katasaraja is believed to have originated from 'kataksha' which Sati's father Daksha Prajapati had taken with Shiva
 is vajah se hinduon main is jagah kii khaasi pratishtha he
 It is believed that during the Mahabharata period, the famous yaksha-yudhishthira dialogue also took place here and Yudhishthira praised the beauty of the place
 mahabharat main ise dwaitvan kaha gaya he jo saraswati nadi ke tat par sthit tha
 Accordingly, it is also an important place for research on the Saraswati river
 katasraj mandir sangeet, kala or vidya kaa bhi bada centre tha
 Around 10,000 scholars and artists were associated with this temple during its height
 lekin 11veen sadi main mahmud gaznavi ke akraman ke baad mandir kaa vaibhav nasht ho gaya
 Artists escaped to save lives and livelihoods and many were enslaved and sold in Arabia from where they reached Europe
 kai shodh bataate hai ki europe kii gypsy yaa romaa jati ke log unheen kalakaaron ke vanshaj hai jinke sangeet ko romaa sangeet kaha jaataa he
 The words of his language also meet Sanskrit
 europe main romaa jati ke logon kii ek vishaal sankhya hai
 According to an estimate, their numbers range from 6 million to 2 million and these are all Indians who had migrated from India in the distant past due to migration or other reasons
 haalanki saare ke saare romaa logon kaa sambandh katasraj se hi ho, is par sanshay he
 But they were definitely people who migrated continuously from the land of India, who had been going out of the country for many reasons for thousands of years
 unki bhashaa main abhi bhi hindi-sanskrit ke kai shabd hai
 The Government of India has been somewhat active about the Romans here and in 2016, the Government of India organized the International Romance Conference in Delhi
 us aayojan main kai deshon ke romaa vidwaan or pratinidhi shaamil hue
 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said that Romana is the child of India
 katasraj mandir main ek vishvavidhyalay bhi tha jo darshanashastra or buddha adhyayan kaa bada centre tha
 It is said that Gorakhnath, the founder of the Nath sect and the famous Chinese traveler Xuanzang also visited
 jab videshi akramanon kii vajah se takshashila kaa patan hua to najadik hone kii vajah se bahut saare vidwaan takshashila se palaayan kar bairangi vishvavidhyalay aa gaye the
 There were a series of universities in the area that extended from Taxila, Katasaraj to Shardapith in Kashmir
 katasraj pakistan ke jis salt range pahadiyon ke paas he vahaan kaa sendha namak aaj bhi hinduon ke liye pavitra he
 Between 6th to 8th century, many kings built a large number of temples in the Salt Range, which still contain the remains of Amba Temple, Nandana Fort, Kafirkot Temple, kalar-kahar Temple, malot-bilot Temple
