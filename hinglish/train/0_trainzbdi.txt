 Singh said on Monday that the cbi's first team investigation led by Arun Kumar, the then joint director of the investigating agency in the aarushi-hemraj murder case, had "flaws"
 maamle ke jaanchakarta rahe agiel kaul ko shradhanjali dete hue bheje gaye sandesh main singh ne kaha ki adhikari ko vishwaas tha ki arushi ke abhibhavak hi dohari hatya ke liye jimmedaar hai

 The former CBI director said that Kaul was under immense pressure from all quarters including his superiors, media and general public during the investigation and hearing as this was one of the major cases settled by the CBI
 lekin kaul ne bahut dhyaan se kaam kiya
 Kaul (54 years) suffered a heart attack while sleeping on Friday
 unhen aspataal le jaaya gaya, jahaan unhen mrit ghoshit kar diya gaya
 Kaul was brought in the aarushi-hemraj double murder case after the then CBI Director Ashwani Kumar dismissed the investigation of the first team led by the then Joint Director Arun Kumar
 kaul ko closer report daakhil kerani padi thi, jisamen un paristhitijanya pramaanon kaa byora tha jinase kishori ke danta chikitsak mata-pita kii sanliptata kaa sanket miltaa tha
 Based on the circumstantial evidence presented by Kaul's investigation team, Rajesh Talwar and his wife Nupur Talwar were convicted by the trial court for the murder of Aarushi and Hemraj and sentenced to life imprisonment

 So has India been teaching civilization to the world since the ancient Stone Age
 yani maanav sabhyataa ne yaheen se duniya ko ungali pakad kar chalanaa sikhaaya
 Experts of the Archaeological Survey of India have been searching for years in the Sasar La area of karakoram Pass in Ladakh
 nubra ghati main eesai kevisheshjmaur joint diji dow esabi ota kii team ko ye kamyaabi haath lagi he
 Dr
 Ota's team noticed during the search expedition that in this inaccessible pass, the spiral road coming between the hill and the valley is gradually going up towards the Sasar stream
 sabhyataa se jude mili kai suraagjaldhara ke saath aage badhate gaye to 22 kilometre kaa safar tay kar team aisi samtal jagah pahunchi jahaan sadak nirmaan ke dauraan khudaai hui thi
 That place surprised them

 Pune police in Maharashtra detained five activists from Mumbai, Nagpur and Delhi on the morning of 6 June
 isi ke saath "shahrimaovad'' vah taaja muhaavara he, jise police, aresas or uske sahyogi oochaal rahe hai
 The five activists were arrested for allegedly making inflammatory statements at a conference in Pune on 31 December last year
 police kaa aarope he ki elgar parishad main bhadakaau bayaanbaji se 1 janvari ko sameepvarti koregaanv-bhima main hinsa bhadak gai thi, jahaan kareeb 3 lakh dalit jamaa hue the
 During this riot one person was killed and flames of violence spread all over Maharashtra
 police ne nagpur ke surendra gadling, soma sen or mahesh raut, mumbai ke sudhir dhawale or dilli ke ronaa wilson ko kathith taur par "daliton ko gumraah karne or samudaayon ke bich vaimnasy badhaakar pratibandhit bhartiya communist party (maovadi) kii kattarpanthi vichaardhaara ko failaane'' kaa aaropee banaaya
 Police claim that evidence has been found on Wilson's laptop that the council received financial assistance from the Maoist organization and that it was prepared for two months
 sarkari vakil ujjwala pavaar ne pune kii adaalat main daawa kiya ki saakshyon ke mutabik, sipii (maovadi) ne "commered sudhir'' ko koregaanv-bhima "abhiyaan'' ko anjaam dene ke liye dhan muhaiyaa karaayaa or "commered soma or surendra'' ko bhavishya main hone vaale kaaryakramon ke liye dhan kaa prabandh karne kaa kaam diya gaya tha
 Pune Police Joint Commissioner Ravindra Kadam said the police had been monitoring the suspected Maoists for a long time
 unhone kaha, "weymaovadake shahari chehre hai or ye us shahari aabaadi ko prabhavit karne kii niti par kaam kar rahe hai, jo haashie par he or khud ko sarkari bhedbhaav kaa shikaar maanati he
 Cases have been registered against the accused under the Unlawful Activities (prevention) Act, which provides for a maximum sentence of seven years of imprisonment
 kadam ne daawa kiya ki elgar parishad ke do maheene pehle se hi do maovadi deepu or mangalu, dhawale ke sampark main the
 The conference speakers spoke of "overthrowing the Brahminical system and empowering Dalits"
 deepu or mangalu par jharkhand, odisha, maharashtra or anya rajyon main surakshabalon par hamale main shaamil rahane kaa aarope he
 These arrests have given rise to a new phrase of "urban Maoism" in people's conversations
 ise sangh parivaar or uske sahyogiyon ne shahari kshetron main mandaraate "laal khatre'' kii tarah uchhaala he
 According to him, "urban Maoism" has made inroads into the cities and towns of the state, especially in places where Dalits have shown deep resentment against the BJP and the Sangh
 jaahir he, badhate dalit asantosh se ghabaraae bhaajapa or sangh netritv ne mudde se dhyaan bhatakaane ke liye yah nayaa muhaavara uchhaala he
 Out of Maharashtra's total population of 120 million people, 55 percent live in urban areas
 is tarah yah desh kaa sarvaadhik shahrikrut rajya he
 In the last two years, this state has become an arena of caste conflict due to rallies and counter-rallies of Maratha and Dalit organizations
 mahatvapurn baat yah he ki "shahari maovadiyon'' ke is nae khauf ko tab hawa di ja rahi he jab sangh netritv yah ranneeti bana rahaa he ki bhaajapa ke khilaaf naaraazgi failaane ke liye vibhinn "takaton'' ke kathith gathbandhan kii chunauti se kaise nipta jaae
 According to the Sangh, various movements such as the "pathalgadi movement" in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand to protest the mining protests in koregaon-bhima (1 January), Tuticorin (22 May) and tribal demands for "autonomy of villages" Maoists are behind this
 is dizin main congress or jignesh mewaani jaise dalit netaaon kii maovadiyon se sathganth kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 According to this view, Maoists are taking root in cities and want to make caste discrimination and duality a tool for this
 sandigdh "shahari kshetron par jor'' (jiske bare main maananaa he ki haalia giraftaareyon se use dhakka pahunchaa he) kii niti par kaam karne ke liye un vampanthi ativaadiyon ke saath sathganth badhaai gai he jinka rajya ke sudur purvi jile gatchiroli se police kii karrwai or sudur gramin kshetron tak prashasan kii badhati pahunch ke kaaran safaya ho gaya he
 Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said on June 7 that the state police had enough evidence to clamp down on the Maoists
 unhone police ko aadesh diya ki vah maovadiyon par ankush lagane main koi kasar baaki na rakhe
 Maharashtra Director General of Police Satish Mathur said the arrests are "part of the police's strategy to end Maoism
" ''intelegence beuro ne shahari maharashtra main maowad ko suraksha ke liye khatra bataaya he
 In a February report, the IB identified metro cities such as Mumbai and Pune as well as smaller cities like Jalgaon, Amalner, Aurangabad, Wardha, Parbhani and Nanded where urban Maoism is flourishing
 may ke antim hafte main mumbai kii ek local train main gatchiroli ke maovadiyon ko shradhanjali dene ke bare main ek poster dekha gaya
 Then soon a more sensational story was told
 sarkari vakil pavaar ne 8 june ko yah khulaasa kiya ki wilson ke laptop main ek aisa letters paaya gaya he jisamen pradhanmantri kii hatya kii sajeesh rachi gai he
 This revelation gave ministers like Nitin Gadkari an opportunity to elaborate about the Red Terror, while many leaders like Sharad Pawar raised doubts about it
 pavaar ne kathith letters ko "logon kii sahanubhuti batorne'' kii chaal bataaya
 In 2011, Dhawale was arrested from Wardha railway station for alleged contact with Maoists
 chaar saal ke baad saboot nahin milane ke kaaran unhen adaalat ne bari kar diya tha
 Another organization, the Kabir Kala Manch (KKM) formed in 2002, is also under investigation for allegedly "promoting Maoism in the name of Ambedkar"
 april main pune police ne kekeem ke chaar kaaryakartaaon harshali potdar, jyoti jagataap, ramesh ghaichor or deepak dhengle ke gharon par chaape maare the
 Potdar and Jagtap allege that the government is maligning Ambedkarites by branding them as Maoists
 jagataap kehete hai, "in ambedkarwaadi kaaryakartaaon ko koregaanv-bhima hinsa ke chah maheene baad isliye giraftaar kiya gaya kyonki in logon ne hindutvvaadi netaa sambhaji bhide kii giraftaar kii maang kii
 "the Forum for Integrated National Security" (FINS), a think tank associated with the RSS, submitted a report to the Maharashtra government in March
 isamen is baat kaa vivaran tha ki kis tarah se dhawale ke sanghathan republican panthars ne puure saal 2017 ke dauraan daliton ko ekajute kiya or kathith taur par koregaanv-bhima main hinsa ko uksaaya
 However, apart from Dalit leader Prakash Ambedkar, the opinion of Ramdas Athawale, who is in the central government, is also different from the police and the government
 modi sarkaar main saamaajik nyaay or shashaktikaran vibhaag ke kanishtha mantri athavle ne dalit yuvaaon se apil kii he ki ve maovadiyon se na juden or unhone giraftaareyon par kaha, "giraftaar kaaryakarta baba sahib ambedkar ke anuyaayi hai to unhen maovadi nahin mana janaa chahie
 Prakash Ambedkar, who objected to the arrest of KKM and Elgar Parishad leaders in April, questioned the arrest of the activists and the openness of Hindutva leaders on the other hand
 unke mutabik, koregaanv-bhima dangon ke mukhya aaropee milind ekbote or sambhaji bhide ko puri chhot mili hui he
 Ambedkar says, "instead of arresting the real culprits, the government is targeting innocents

 jald hi mancricket vishwa cap2011 ke kawarej ke liye iespien star sports team ke saath dhaka ke liye ravaanaa ho jaaoongaa
 Cricket World Cup is happening after 15 years in the Indian subcontinent
 cricketron ke alaava main un jaankaar logon se bhi miloongaa jo gambhirtha se maanate hai ki pakistani team main vah chamak nahin ki vishwa cap main chakachaundh kar sake
 i have said it before, and would like to say that this team playing under the captaincy of Shahid Afridi has the power to reach the semi-finals
 vah vahaan tak pahunch jaati he to phir use koi roak nahin sakegaa
 For almost five years, the Pakistani cricket team has not been able to do anything special
 lekin uske khilaadi puure josh main hai, unke haavbhaav kaaphi achche sanket dete hai
 The pressure on the teams of this subcontinent is always heavy
 vishwa cap 1996 main bengalore main khele gaye quarter final main pakistan bharat se haar gaya tha or bharat ne edan garden main srilanka kekhilaaf match main gud gobar kar diya tha
 Actually, sometimes the pressure on the teams increases so much that they are unable to handle
 ummid karen ki bharat, pakistan, srilanka is baar dabaav kaa acchhee tarah saamana karenge
 South Africa, Australia and host India are already being considered as the strongest contenders for the cup
 is suchi main main england nahin balki pakistan ko shaamil karnaa chaahunga
 The schedule of matches (due to which every team will have to sit for six days after one match) is being criticized by many people
 lekin meraa maananaa he ki yah tiimon ke liye acha hi he kyonki unhen tazaadam hone ke liye kaaphi samay mil jayega
 Recall, in 2007, both India and Pakistan had lost their fun due to the constant pressure of matches
 is baar tiimon ko ek match main kharaab pradarshan ke baad vaapasi ke liye paryaapt samay milegaa
 i have seen the craze for this game in both India and Pakistan
 maichon ke dauraan ye ladaai kaa maidan hi ban jate hai
 So, players will have to deal with the pressure better and avoid collapsing completely due to the initial setbacks
 is bich bharat main media ne is vishwa cap ko sachin tendulkar cap ke taur par prachaarit karnaa shuru kar diya he, ki bhartiya team ko or kuch nahin to tendulkar kii khatir hi yah vishwa cap jeetna chahie
 This type of pressure has to be given to the team at times
 1992 main pakistan ne jab vishwa cap jeeta tha tab kisi ek khilaadi ke naam ko team ke sitare ke taur par nahin uchhaala gaya tha
 Indian cricket lovers should allow Tendulkar to play his comfortable game
 aisa hua to bhartiya team ko koi nahin roak paaegaa
 Before the World Cup, there has been little discussion about the Pakistani team and its players
 meri ummiden anbhavi olerounder abdul rajjak par tiki hai, jo is vishwa cap main ubharne vaale pramukh khilaadiyon main se ek sabit ho sakate hai
 There was a time when all-rounders like Sir Richard Hadlee, Imran Khan, Kapil Dev and Ian Botham competed for the pinnacle
 aaj rajjaq ko shen watasan or yusuf pathan jaise khilaadiyon se hode leni hogi
 These three players are the only ones who can change the stance of a match on their own
 agar rajjak apni gendbaaji main or dhar laaen or fielding ko behatar kar len to ve match jitau khilaadi sabit ho sakate hai
 In the absence of Mohammad Aamir and Mohammad Asif (both banned by the icc's anti-corruption tribunal), Razzaq and Umar Gul will have to play the destructive pair with the new ball for Pakistan
 or phir anbhavi shoeb akhtar honge, jo feet rahe to pari kii shuruyaat main yaa bich main yaa antim overon main reverse swings or angoothatod yorkron ke kaaran kaaphi kaam ke sabit ho sakate hai
 Pakistan will also lack all-rounder Sohail Tanvir
 vishwa cap 1992 main jeet ne pakistan ke saath cricket kii pahchaan jod di thi or hamaare rashtriya gaurav ko kaaphi badhaayaa tha
 Another such victory is necessary to forget the tragic past of Pakistan cricket
 wasim akram pakistani team ke purv captain hai or ab iespien star sports main camentator hai
 This column is based on his conversation with Deputy Editor Shantanu Guha Ray
 When Pakistan won the 1992 World Cup, no player was cast as a star
 bhartiya cricket premiyon ko chahie ki ve tendulkar ko sahaj khel khilne den
 Then no one will stop the Indian team
 mumbai ke dahisar ilaake ke ek baar main police ne chapa markar 22 logon ko hiraasat main liya he

 Police have also detained 7 girls
 is baar se police ne 60 hajaar rupye bhi jabt kiye hai
 Whenever a team performs amazing charisma in the field, then the fans do not know what kind of actions take place in joy and frenzy
 lekin cricket ke maidan main aapane kam hi dekha hoga ki koi captain itnaa josh main aa jaae ki vah apni jersey utarkar hawa main lahraane lage
 Sourav Ganguly's jersey waving after the natwest final win over Lords is still fresh in the minds of cricket lovers
 dada ko yah mauka dene vaale us match ke hero mohammad caff somvaar ko apana 34waan janmdin manaa rahe hai
 Kaif, who was called the Mecca of Cricket, gave India a historic victory over England by playing an unbeaten 87 runs in 2002
 match jeetne ke liye bharat ke saamne 326 ranon kaa bahut hi mushkil lakshya tha
 In front of this mountain-like score, 5 veterans of Team India (ganguly, Sehwag, Dravid, Tendulkar and Mongia) returned to the pavilion for a mere 146 runs
 phir lagane laga ki team ke baaki ballebaaj bhi aasaani se ghutane tech denge
 But the two promising Team India, Mohammad Kaif and Yuvraj Singh had different intentions
 donon ne milakar angrej gendbaajon kii bakhiya udhedte hue team india ko jeet dilaa di
 Yuvi played a brilliant innings of 69 runs before being dismissed
 is jeet ke hero mohammad caff ko kariyar main pehali baar 'main of da match' ke khitaab se nawaja gaya
 Mohammad Kaif is among those Indian players who got off to a good start, but could not prolong their careers
 2000 main jab india under-19 team ne caff kii captaini main vishwacap jeeta, to laga ki bharat ko bhavi captain mil gaya
 But he could play only 125 odis and 13 Tests for India
 isaki vajah kai sari raheen
 Among the biggies, Kaif got mostly lower order batting, which probably did not give him a chance to do justice to his talent
 apni behtareen fielding ke liye charchaa main rahane vaale mohammad caff ke naam ek anokhaa record he
 Kaif holds the record for most (4) catches in a World Cup match, which he took against Sri Lanka at the 2003 World Cup

 a day after the Champions Trophy final of June 18, 2017, BCCI secretary Amitabh Chaudhary, CEO Rahul Johri and then general manager M
K
 ve
 Sridhar (who died in September 2017) met Kumble and Kohli at a London hotel
 sanyog se ve pehle kumble se akele mili, phir viraat kohli se or baad main kohli or kumble donon se ek saath or ant main kumble se phir ek choti mulaakaat kii
 While negotiating with the BCCI, Kumble denied any dispute, Kohli, while presenting several examples, clarified the reason for the relationship deteriorating, which was confirmed by the members present there
 unamem se ek ne mujhe bataaya, "donon ke bich aamane-saamne kii koi takkar nahin thi, na hi aisa tha ki donon ek-duusare ko dekhnaa na chahen, balki kai chote-chote flashpoint the or do vichaaron kaa takaraav tha
 Both are two different personalities
 ''bisisiai adhikari sthiti ko suljhaana chaah rahe the, lihaaja unhone kumble or kohli ke saath ek saajha baithak kii peshkash kii jiske liye ve sahaj taiyaar ho gaye
 The meeting went on peacefully, but in their 50-minute period, the two did not agree on a single point
 ek adhikari ne kaha, "iske ant main hamen mahasoos hua ki yah baat nahin ban sakati
 There was no fight between them, just the two were not agreeing with each other
 '' yah ek durbhagyapurna sthiti thi, par bhartiya cricket ke hiton ke liye donon main se ek ko to peeche hatana hi tha
 In the last meeting with Kumble, all the officials expressed regret that they could not get the two players to agree
 yahi samay tha jab us samay tak hotel chhodkar isisi siisi kii meeting ke liye tata samooh kii buckingham road sthit imaarat main rahane chale gaye kumble ne istipha dene kaa faisla liya or westeindies ravaanaa nahin hue
 a post on social media that evening revealed that he felt humiliated
 unhone likhaa tha ki bhartiya team ke mukhya coach ke pad se istife kaa kaaran viraat ke saath "asahmati'' he
 Kumble was crowned as India's head coach a year ago
 unke kaarykaal ke dauraan bharat ek bhi shrunkhlaa nahin haara
 Such incidents usually do not occur when the team is performing at its best
 bhartiya cricket ke do ahm kirdaaron main se ek se phone par or duusare ke mumbai lautne par vyaktigat baatcheet hui—kumble ne kathith rup se do muddon par apni shikaayat jataai
 First, he felt bad that three members of the Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) set up in 2015 — his former teammate Sourav Ganguly, V
 ve
 s
 lakshmana or sachin tendulkar—ne unase salaah lene yaa unka paksh jaanane main koi dilchaspee nahin dikhaai
 Secondly, under the instructions of the Supreme Court, the Cricket Administrators Committee, which oversees Indian cricket affairs and the top management of the BCCI, did not even care to know their side
 ek adhikari ne kaha, "ham is sthiti main kya kar sakate the? is puri ghatana ke dauraan cricket salaahkaar samiti kaa maananaa tha ki agar kohli or kumble ke bich maamla sulajh gaya to kumble pad par bane rahenge
 He told us in writing, which he wrote in haste after the meeting at the Landmark Hotel on 17 June
 uski copy hamaare paas maujuud he
 In fact, the letter, republished on the front page, clearly states that even after meeting Kohli, the advisory committee felt that Kumble should be retained as the head coach
 isliye samiti ne bisisiai ko salaah di thi ki bhartiya cricket ke hiton kii khatir unke matbhedon kaa samaadhaan karne kii koshish honi chahie
 This clearly shows that even if the top officials had listened to Kumble, there could have been only two aspects of the story
 pehla, donon vyaktiyon ke bich koi matbhed nahin, jiskaa daawa kumble ne apni soshal media post main kiya tha, jiskaa khandan kohli bisisiai ke saath pichhali kai baatcheet main karte dikhe the
 Secondly, he was being treated unfairly and the BCCI and Advisory Committee were standing in the captain's court ignoring the coach
 bharat main cricket kaa badshaah hota he captain, jiske nazariye ko sarvopari ahmiyat di jaati he jaisaa ki ganguli-chapel or ganguli-bukanan vaali sthitiyon se spasht he
 As a result, Kumble had to change course when the situation did not appear to be resolved for a long time
 kya bisisiai kohli ke saamne kumble ko variyata de sakati thi? jawaab bilkul saaf he-nahin
 How the matter was revealed The interviews i conducted revealed that the situation had reached a peak during the second Test match between India and England in Visakhapatnam in November 2016
 isse pehle rajkot test ke dauraan donon ke bich ek maamle main matbhed ho chukaa tha
 Of course that match was drawn, but England had a heavy upper hand
 so vishakhapatnam main dabaav bhartiya team par tha or anumaan jataayaa ja rahaa tha ki yahaan england team 2012 main mili safalataa ko doharaa sakati he
 Alastair Cook's English team defeated India in the 2012 home series and due to this Kohli and Kumble were feeling the increased pressure
 haalanki bisisiai ke ek varisht adhikari bataate hai ki donon ke bich team ke chunaav se jude ek maamle par vivaad ho gaya tha, lekin anya kaa kahana tha ki kumble apni aadat ke mutabik khel ke maidan main captain ke liye baar-baar nirdesh bhejte the or shuruyaat main donon ke bich manmutav kii vajah yahi bani
 The root cause of the controversy was that there were two such legendary players in the dressing form, whose career was full of achievements
 ve donon hi peeche hatane ko taiyaar na the, so unke bich vivaad gaharaata chalaa gaya
 In Visakhapatnam, a major storm began to take shape, but it came to an end at the end of the tenth edition of IPL in May 2017, when the people of the administration committee called on Kumble in Hyderabad to negotiate a possible increase in the money that players and coaches are getting
 Met
 samiti ke ek sadsy ne kaha, "hamen tab tak andaja na tha ki halaat itane bighad chuke the
 We had also asked Kumble if he had the confidence of the players that they could put their side before us? Then Kumble said that he had already spoken to the players
 '' prashasan samiti ke ek sadsy ne bataaya ki kumble kii baton ko maanate hue baithak main maujuud sanjay bangad (purv bhartiya ol-rounder or team ke batting coach) or aar
 Sridhar (the team's fielding coach) agreed with Kumble
 iske baad jab kumble ne apane contract ko badhaane kii baat kii, tab prashasan samiti ko andeh hua ki kahin kuch gadabad he
 The official said, "kumble's contract was till the end of the Champions Trophy and there was no reason for Kumble to be restless given the team's performance during the last 12 months
 phir ve kyon ise badhaane ke liye maahaul bana rahe the?'' tabhi yah faisla kiya gaya ki kumble ke prajentation par kohli se vichaar-vimarsh kiya jaae or maaloom kiya jaae ki captain or coach ke bich kya chal rahaa he? bataate hai, bisisiai siio rahul johari ko maamle kii jaankaree thi or em
 V
 shridhar or sachiv amitabh choudhary jaise logon ko bhi donon ke bich kharaab hote rishton kaa andaja tha
 But no one knew how bad the case was
 kohli se sampark kiye jane par unhone sthiti kaa khulaasa karne kaa faisla kiya
 His behavior was extremely dignified, he told that junior players are hesitating to keep up and gradually things are getting difficult
 chand dinon ke bheetar team tour par jane vaali thi, lihaaja sambhav nahin tha ki raaton-raat kisi or kii niyukti ho or vyaavhaarik rup se bhi yah sambhav nahin tha ki kumble ko team ke saath jane se roka jaae
 Vinod Rai, chairman of the governance committee, says, "we had to do something for the interest of Indian cricket and in the then situation there was nothing better than announcing that a new coach is being sought
 ham jaanate the ki iske liye yah thik samay nahin he, par hamaare paas yahi ek vikalp tha
 With this backdrop, the Indian team led by Kohli and Kumble landed on England to save the Champions Trophy title
 is bich nae coach kii talash shuru ho gai thi or 4 june ko birmingham main pakistan ke saath hue pehle match se purv hi kuch chuninda logon ke naam media main aa chuke the
 The most notable of these was Sehwag

" ''champions trophy ke liye england main jamaa sau se zyada bhartiya patrakaron ke liye khel ke maidan main khitaab bachaane jitani hi badi khabar thi captain or coach ke bich kaa vivaad
 On 2 June, when BCCI Secretary (amitabh Chaudhary) met the media at England's time in Edgbaston, Birmingham, more than half of the questions were asked on the captain-coach issue
 choudhary ne yah kahkar jaan bachaai ki unhen is bare main koi jaankaree nahin
 Contrary to Chaudhary's expectations, the media published a full letter from the administration committee member Ram Guha in which he cited one reason for his resignation that the administration committee did not handle the kohli-kumble episode properly
 guha ne prashasan samiti adhyaksh vinod raay ko sambodhit apane patr ke chauthe point main kumble ke bare main kaha, "pichley satr ke dauraan bhartiya team kaa record shandaar rahaa he
 Much credit is being given to the players for this, but certainly some credit should be given to the head coach and his colleagues
 agar nyaay or yogyata aadhaarit pranali hoti to mukhya coach kaa kaarykaal badha diya jaataa
 On the contrary, Kumble was kept in the dark and then it was said that the advertisement for the post would be removed again
 isse spasht he ki is mudde ko bisisiai siio ne behad asamvedansheel or galat tareeke se sambhala
 Unfortunately, along with the administration committee, the BCCI officials also became silent in this case

 aaj ke bhartiya khiladinnon ko antarrashtriya chalan se alag apane vito power se camentry team ke sadasyon ko chunane kaa adhikaar mila hua he
 If the coach's post has been included in this list, then can the selectors, even the office bearers, turn up

 Unfortunately, none of us know the story of Kohli's part and we assumed that he was wrong
 sab samajhate the ki unhone kumble ke saath durvyavhaar kiya tha or bharat ke mahaan match-vijeta kaa majaak udaaya
 He does not get a chance to speak as BCCI has rules and laws and Guha is standing with Kumble (both from Bangalore), so Kohli's position is like that of a young boxer with his arm tied in the ring

 The woman thought that these people had come to take the dog to the shelter home, but nothing like this happened

 mahila kaa kahana he ki main kute kii maalik nahin thi, lekin use ek maheene tak khaanaa khilaayaa or usne bilkul pareshaan nahin kiya

 adhikari ne kaha ki whotsape bharat main hi apni ek team khadi karne main lagi he

 When contacted, a whatsapp spokesperson said, "to help our users in India and to continue our investment in the country, our first priority is to appoint a local person who can help us build a local team

 Regarding the role of whatsapp messages in some incidents of recent mob beatings, the company believes that government, society and tech companies will have to work together to tackle the problem of mob attacks
 company ne kaha, "isiliye ham pehle hi apni sevaaon main kaaphi badlaav kar chuke hai taaki bhraamak soochnaaon ke prasar kii gati ko dhimaa kiya ja sake

 This was one of the major demands of the government

 team india ke purv captain mahendra singh dhoni yun to apane shant or saral swabhaav ke liye jane jate hai
 But whenever he gets a chance, either outside the field or inside he does something that gets in the headlines
 haalanki dhoni kaa ye kissa 10 saal purana he lekin iskaa khulaasa ab ho rahaa he
 Former Indian cricket team batsman VVS Laxman in his book has told an anecdote related to Dhoni which is related to his fun and all-round style
 lakshmana ne 2008 ke is kisse ko yaad karte hue apni kitaab main likhaa ki jab nagpur main unhone apana 100waan test khelaa tha tab dhoni maidan se khud bas chalaakar team ko hotel tak le gaye the, us dauraan dhoni teenon formet kii captaini kar rahe the
 In this match, former veteran spinner Anil Kumble also announced his retirement from cricket
 lakshmana ne likhaa ki dhoni ko bas chalaate dekhakar meri ankhon ko bharosa nahin hua, team kaa captain hamen bas main baitaakar maidan se hotel tak le gaya tha
 This was Dhoni's first Test match as captain after Kumble's retirement and he was not worried about the world
 dhoni kabhi bhi romaanchak palon ko jeena nahin chhodte or main dhoni jaise kisi bhi khilaadi se ajtak nahin mila hum
 Writing about Dhoni, Laxman also said that he was always calm even if the team performed poorly
 lakshmana 2011 kii england siries ko yaad karte hai, jab team india mushkil main thi, lekin dhoni ne kabhi bhi apana aapa nahin khoyaa
 India had lost the series 4–0 and after that we had lost the first 3 Tests against Australia, despite all this, Dhoni remained calm even though the rest of the players had a sense of disappointment and frustration

 Only 30 years old Avatar Singh Thakor is counting his last breath
 doctoron ne kah diya he ki unka brain tumor antim stage main he or ab unke paas zyada saansen nahin hai, lekin is sthiti main bhi unke mata-pita unase pichley ek maheene se milane nahin aae hai
 This bitterness began three years ago, when Avatar Singh was married to Nayana
 avatar gujarat ichology kamishan main bataur acount assistant naukari karte the
 On November 11, 2012, soon after the wedding, Avatar fell unconscious during a party at a farm near Ahmedabad
 paas ke privet aspataal main le gaye, to pataa chalaa unhen brain tumor he
 He was treated
 zyaadaatar paise saathi karmchaariyon ne jutaaye or thodaa paisa pita ne bhi diya, lekin uske baad se hi ghar main saas-bahu ke bich anban shuru ho gai or kuch hi samay main pati-patni ko ghar se nikalnaa padaa
 Troubles started since then
 patni ne mehnat karke pati ko dobaaraa apane pairon par khadaa kiya
 Avatar started the job again, but due to illness, he could not work for long
 phir avatar kii patni ne ek privet aspataal main bataur nurse naukari kii, lekin pati kii seva main use naukari bhi chhodani padi
 The disease increased
 baat yahaan tak pahunch gai kii chah maheene pehle unki ankhon kii roshni bhi puri tarah jaati rahi he
 The situation continued to deteriorate
 jab halaat bilkul hi bighad gaye to patni apane pati ke saath maayke chali ai bhai ke saath rahane
 When the extent of financial helplessness was exceeded, Avatar filed an application in the family court and demanded maintenance from his father
 court ne bhi najuk halaat ko bhaanpate hue turant sunwaayee kii, kyonki avatar kaa ilaaj kar rahe doctors kii aashaa bhi dhoomil ho rahi he
 The court summoned the father and heard him and gave an interim order that he should be given monthly maintenance of eight thousand rupees immediately so that his son can be treated
 court ne kaha ki betaa agar shaareerik taur par kaam karne kii sthiti main nahin ho or pita ke paas uske rakrakhaav kii aarthik takat ho to pita ko bhi zarur saath dena chahie
 The father told the court that he was ready to take the son and daughter-in-law together, but the son refused to leave
 mahatvapurn he ki court ne apane aadesh main likhaa ki ye gambhir maamla he ki jab court ne pita ko unke pita ke taur par kartavyon ke bare main bataaya to unhone kaha ki wo jail jane ko taiyaar hai, lekin wo bete ko paisa dene ko taiyaar nahin he
 The comments haalanki, pita se jab enditivi ne poocha to unhone kaha ki ye sahi baat he ki wo pichley ek maheene se antim saanse gin rahe bete ko dekhne nahin gaye hai, lekin wo majaboor hai
 Father Prem Singh said that he had no problem with his son
 jo anban he wo unki bahu se he
 He fears that if he goes to meet the son, then he may not let him meet or insult him, but in the interim order of the court, the things written about the father also tell Avatar's trouble
 avatar lekin ab bhi logon se apil karnaa chahta he ki wo abhi jeena chahta he or madad kii guhaar kar rahaa he ki shaayad koi doctor desh ke kisi hisse se aage aae or unke ilaaj kii koi sambhaavna talash sake, kyonki ahmedabad main zyaadaatar aspataalon main wo ja chuke hai or ab sabhi doctoron ne haath khadey kar die hai ki isse zyada is beemaari kaa ilaaj unke paas nahin he
 This bitterness began three years ago, when Avatar Singh was married to Nayana

 On November 11, 2012, soon after the wedding, Avatar fell unconscious during a party at a farm near Ahmedabad
 paas ke privet aspataal main le gaye, to pataa chalaa unhen brain tumor he
 He was treated
 zyaadaatar paise saathi karmchaariyon ne jutaaye or thodaa paisa pita ne bhi diya, lekin uske baad se hi ghar main saas-bahu ke bich anban shuru ho gai or kuch hi samay main pati-patni ko ghar se nikalnaa padaa
 Troubles started since then
 patni ne mehnat karke pati ko dobaaraa apane pairon par khadaa kiya
 Avatar started the job again, but due to illness, he could not work for long
 phir avatar kii patni ne ek privet aspataal main bataur nurse naukari kii, lekin pati kii seva main use naukari bhi chhodani padi
 The disease increased
 baat yahaan tak pahunch gai kii chah maheene pehle unki ankhon kii roshni bhi puri tarah jaati rahi he
 The situation continued to deteriorate
 jab halaat bilkul hi bighad gaye to patni apane pati ke saath maayke chali ai bhai ke saath rahane
 When the extent of financial helplessness was exceeded, Avatar filed an application in the family court and demanded maintenance from his father
 court ne bhi najuk halaat ko bhaanpate hue turant sunwaayee kii, kyonki avatar kaa ilaaj kar rahe doctors kii aashaa bhi dhoomil ho rahi he
 The court summoned the father and heard him and gave an interim order that he should be given monthly maintenance of eight thousand rupees immediately so that his son can be treated
 court ne kaha ki betaa agar shaareerik taur par kaam karne kii sthiti main nahin ho or pita ke paas uske rakrakhaav kii aarthik takat ho to pita ko bhi zarur saath dena chahie
 The father told the court that he was ready to take the son and daughter-in-law together, but the son refused to leave
 mahatvapurn he ki court ne apane aadesh main likhaa ki ye gambhir maamla he ki jab court ne pita ko unke pita ke taur par kartavyon ke bare main bataaya to unhone kaha ki wo jail jane ko taiyaar hai, lekin wo bete ko paisa dene ko taiyaar nahin he
 The comments haalanki, pita se jab enditivi ne poocha to unhone kaha ki ye sahi baat he ki wo pichley ek maheene se antim saanse gin rahe bete ko dekhne nahin gaye hai, lekin wo majaboor hai
 Father Prem Singh said that he had no problem with his son
 jo anban he wo unki bahu se he
 He fears that if he goes to meet the son, then he may not let him meet or insult him, but in the interim order of the court, the things written about the father also tell Avatar's trouble
 avatar lekin ab bhi logon se apil karnaa chahta he ki wo abhi jeena chahta he or madad kii guhaar kar rahaa he ki shaayad koi doctor desh ke kisi hisse se aage aae or unke ilaaj kii koi sambhaavna talash sake, kyonki ahmedabad main zyaadaatar aspataalon main wo ja chuke hai or ab sabhi doctoron ne haath khadey kar die hai ki isse zyada is beemaari kaa ilaaj unke paas nahin he

 However, when NDTV was asked by the father, he said that it is right that he has not gone to see the son who was counting the last breath for the last one month, but he is helpless
 pita premasingh ne kaha ki unhen apane bete ke koi shikawa nahin he
 The difference is with his daughter-in-law
 unhen dar he ki wo agar bete se milane gaye to bahoot shaayad unhen nahin milane de yaa unka apmaan kar de, lekin court ke antarim aadesh main pita ke bare main likhi baaten avatar kii takalif bhi bayaan karti hai
 Avatar but still wants to appeal to the people that he wants to live now and is asking for help that a doctor might come from some part of the country and find any possibility of their treatment, because in most hospitals in Ahmedabad, he Have gone and now all the doctors have raised their hands that they do not have more treatment for this disease
 avatar lekin ab bhi logon se apil karnaa chahta he ki wo abhi jeena chahta he or madad kii guhaar kar rahaa he ki shaayad koi doctor desh ke kisi hisse se aage aae or unke ilaaj kii koi sambhaavna talash sake, kyonki ahmedabad main zyaadaatar aspataalon main wo ja chuke hai or ab sabhi doctoron ne haath khadey kar die hai ki isse zyada is beemaari kaa ilaaj unke paas nahin he
 The Samajwadi Party chief, Akhilesh Yadav, who is busy tying up for a strong opposition ahead of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, may get a shock
 sapa netaa abu azmi ne akhilesh yadav ko chitthee likh congress se gathbandhan naa karne kii salaah di he
 Maharashtra unit president Abu Azmi termed the Congress as a 'traitor' and a 'soft Hindutva Party from the inside' and said that he would field his candidates if the SP formed an alliance with this party
 azmi ne sapa adhyaksh ko gat 25 april ko likhe patr main mumbai mahanagar palika ke prabhag ke chunaav main congress ke virdohi rukh kaa zikr karte hue kaha he ‘‘congress ek avasarwaadi, dhokheybaaj or andar se naram hindutvvaadi party he
 It is not only our responsibility to save secularism
 aap congress ke saath usee vakt gathbandhan kijiye jab saare desh main jahaan-jahaan hamaari party he, vahaan hamaari shakti ke mutabik hamen hissaa mili
 Talking to PTI, Abu Azmi said that last April 19 was the election of the division of Mumbai Metropolitan Municipality under his constituency
 chunaav jeetne ke liye sapa ko congress ke ekmaatr vot kii sakht jarurat thi, lekin uske iklaute nagarsevak vithal lokare ne party pradesh adhyaksh sanjay nirupam ke ishaare par khuleam shivasena ko vot diya
 Azmi has also written in the letter sent to the SP President that if you (akhilesh) combine with Congress, i will contest my candidate and then on one side you will be with Congress and we will contest against Congress
 is sawaal par ki kya vah congress se gathbandhan kii sthiti main sapa se baghawat karenge, azmi ne kaha ki vah aisa bilkul nahin karenge
 Meanwhile, SP national secretary Rajendra Chaudhary said that he had no information about Azmi's letter
 is sawaal par ki kya akhilesh karnataka main congress pratyaashiyon ke samarthan main chunaav prachaar karne jaaenge, choudhary ne kaha ki sapa adhyaksh kaa karnataka main prachaar karne jane kaa koi kaarykram hi nahin bana he
 He said that the SP has fielded candidates in some seats in the Karnataka assembly elections, but there is no schedule set for Akhilesh to campaign in his favor

 66 The glory of the major Kashi Vishwanath temple in Dwadash Jyotirlingas in Varanasi is world famous
 yah mandir ganga nadi ke tat par vidyaman he
 Today Prime Minister Narendra Modi was on a tour of his constituency Kashi and he performed pooja at Kashi Vishwanath Temple
 yahaan pahunchakar pradhanmantri modi ne duusari baar piem pad kii shapath lene se pehle shrikashi vishwanath se raashtra main shanti or samruddhi kaa aashirwad maanga
 In such a situation, let us know 5 such things related to the world famous Kashi Vishwanath temple, about which very few people know
 kaashi vishwanath mandir se judi aisi 5 anokhi baaten --kaashi vishwanath jyotirling do bhaagon main banta hua he
 In the right part of the Jyotirlinga, Mother Bhagwati is seated in the form of Shakti and on the other side Lord Shiva is seated in the left form (beautiful)
 yahi vajah he ki kaashi ko mukti kaa dham kaha jaataa he
 -all the idols are facing west at the time of decoration in the Kashi Vishwanath temple
 is jyotirling main shiv or shakti donon ek saath hi virajte hai, jo behad adbhut he
 Let me tell you, this is not seen anywhere else in the world
 -vishwanath darbar main garbh grih kaa shikhar he
 In this, the dome upwards is adorned with Sri Yantra
 tantric siddhi ke liye ye upyukt sthaan mana jaataa he
 It is considered to be the core for Sri yantra-tantra practice
 - baba vishwanath ke darbar main tantra kii drushti se chaar pramukh dwaar is prakaar hai- shanti dwaar, kala dwaar, pratishtha dwaar, nivritti dwaar
 These four gates have a different place in the system
 puri duniya main aisi koi jagah nahin he jahaan shivshakti ek saath virajman hon or vahaan tantra dwaar bhi maujuud ho
 - Baba Vishwanath is seated as a Guru and King in Kashi
 vah dinabhar guru rup main kaashi main bhraman karte hai
 At nine o'clock in the night, when Baba's Shringa Aarti is performed, he is in disguise
 yahi vajah he ki bhagwaan shiv ko rajrajeshwar bhi kaha jaataa he

 gauratlab he ki isse pehle shivasena ne maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis kii ore se chif ekjicutive officer (siio) niyukt kiye jane kii tikhi aalochana kii he

 par mumbai kaa pet koun bharegaa is sawaal kaa jawaab kisi ke paas kyon nahin he?uddhav ne kaha ki ab se 12 saal pehle bhi rajya main siio kii niyukti kii baat kahi gai thi
 It was fiercely opposed even then

 hyderabad encounter par lodha bole- ham hammurabi kii sabhyataa kii ore bad rahelodha ne kaha- mantri hatya ko tehraata he sahi, kaise karen human ritis kii ummidamanvadhikaar diwas par supreme court ke purv chif justise aaram lodha ne kaha ki ham hammurabi sabhyataa kii ore bad rahe hai
 At the event held in Delhi, Lodha said that today we are celebrating Human Rights Day on one hand and on the other hand we are also fighting to protect basic human rights
 har jagah araajaktaa kaa maahaul he
 The incident in Telangana is an example of this
 telugana main hue police encounterki ghatana par unhone sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki jab ek mantri hi aisi hatya ko sahi tehraata he to ham aap apane human rhite kii sunishchitata kii kya ummid kar sakate hai? ham us sabhyataa kii taraf bad rahe he, jahaan nyaay ke liye bheed kii maansikta hi aadhaar hoti thi

 It seems that we are moving towards the same era
 kisi bhi maamle main nishpaksh sunwaayee or prakritik nyaay aavashyak he, lekin ham ye sab karke desh kii nyaay pranali ko dhwast kar rahe hai
 Referring to the police reforms, Lodha said that the Supreme Court's directive on police reforms in the Prakash Singh case has been on hold for the last 30 years
 nyaaypalika par sarkaar behad kam kharch karti haih lodhounhone kaha ki scientific investigeshan yaa profeshnals kii kami ek badi samasya he
 Due to this, the hearing of cases is delayed
 ye badi vidambnaa he ki hamaare paas scientific jaanch ke liye bas 7 hi lab hai
 He also questioned the low budget given by the government to the judiciary
 justise lodha ne kaha ki sarkaar nyaaypalika ke liye apane bajet kaa sirf 0
 Spends 08%
 nyaaypalika main jajon kii bahut kami he
 Many positions are lying vacant in the judiciary
 nirbhaya fund ke istemaal nahin hone par bhi uthaae sawalnirbhaya fundka zikr karte hue lodha ne kaha ki mahilaon kii suraksha or punarvaas main sahyog ke liye ye kosh 2013 main banaaya gaya tha
 Statistics show that 90 per cent of that fund has not been used by the states
 koi bhi project bana to us project kaa kriyanvayan thik tarah se nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 Many projects have remained on paper
 is samay hamaare desh main mahilaon or bacchon kii sthiti gambhir he
 It is time for us to strengthen the system
 isliye blem game band hona chahie or sirf kaam hona chahie
 What former Chief Justice Lodha said on CAB? Former Chief Justice of Supreme Court RM Lodha has also commented on the Citizenship (amendment) Bill

 This bill has not been finalized yet
 iske kanoon banane ke baad hi kuch kaha ja saktaa he
 At the same time, the Citizenship (amendment) Bill has been passed by the Lok Sabha
 ab buudhvaar ko isko rajyasabha main pesh kiya jayega
 If this bill is also passed by the Rajya Sabha, it will take the form of law as soon as the President approves it
 vahiin, vipakshi partiyaan modi sarkaar ke naagarikta (sanshodhan) bill kaa virodh kar rahi hai
 Questions are also being raised about its constitutionality
 har koi paidaa aaazaad hi hota he
 But soon others adapt to you
 pehle maa-baap, phir skool or baad main samaaj
 They try to lock you in boxes, forcing them to look and decide things in certain ways
 isi ke mutabik hamaari manogranthiyaan, asurakshaayen, dar, aakankshaayen or sapane banate hai
 Eventually you start tightening things in these molds, then one day suddenly you realize that you have been in auto mode your whole life
 yah hamaare makasad ko hi hameshaa ke liye ojhal kar detaa he, nai chijen aajamaane, khojbin karne or khud apana sach paane ke makasad ko
 Just because society hands over a pre-decided truth in your hands
 talash is samoochee jakadaaa ko todgaye kii jaddojahad kii he, khud apana sach paane kii he
 It is a non-stop journey, a journey to gain the freedom to understand the truth
 logon ke bagaiyr samaaj kaa koi vajood nahin he
 If man does not move forward, does not develop himself, then society also cannot
 par yahaan bhi ek ajeeb dwait kaam karata he
 The society was created for the ease and convenience of the people, to show them the right path
 magar yah ulate tareeke se kaam karnaa shuru kar detaa he
 It starts controlling you
 yah dimag ke khilne-khulne ko nyauta nahin detaa
 The society is alive as long as the people living in it are asking questions
 or agar samaaj ke bheetar sudhaarak hai, to samaaj sawaalon ko nyauta degaa
 The problem is that power-hungry people do not want to be asked questions
 sawaal poochne kii jarurat har shaks ke bheetar maujuud he, yah alag baat he ki kabhi-kabhi logon ko lagata he ki ise dabaa lenaa aasaan he
 At times, people are also made to feel afraid of this nature
 bachapan main main badi besabri se namaaj ke vakt kaa intjaar kiya karata tha
 i used to read namaz from Khuda's Janib Khalis Mohabbat, trying to get closer to her
 haalanki us vakt bhi mujhe tajjub hota tha ki main samajhataa bhi hum ki main kya kah rahaa hum? yahi vajah he ki maine qurbaani kii rasm par sawaal uthaaya
 i only said that the reason behind that ritual should be known
 is par waisi pratikriyaayein ain to yah meri aawaaj kii takat nahin thi, yah unki aasthaa ko lalakaare jane kaa dar tha
 True faith is never so fragile
 yah to satahi aasthaa hi he jo aasaani se dar jaati he
 i always talk to my family on these issues
 yah kabhi mudda nahin banataa
 But after my statements my brother told me that our friends are asking, "what has Bhaijaan said?" i told him to talk to me the most and we talked
 maine poocha, ''maine jo kaha usamen galat kya he?'' unhone mujhase kaha ki aap jo kah rahe ho, vah sahi he lekin aapako aisa kahana nahin chahie tha
 So do we want to remain blind? What will we achieve with this? There is a beautiful line that says my character in Life of Pi
 yah line ab meri jindagi kaa mantra hi ban gai he
 That line is, "doubt is a thing of great use
" yah aasthaa ko jinda rakhata he
 After all, until you do not test, you cannot know the strength of your faith

 Even before the release of the film Padmavati, there is a crisis of ban on it
 karani sena ne itihaas se chhedchhad ke naam par film kaa virodh shuru kiya to ladaai sadakon tak pahunch gai
 The claims of messing with the identity of the Rajputs began to be made

 The result was that they had to postpone the release
 lekin itane bhar se hangaamaa shant nahin ho rahaa he
 Now Sanjay Leela Bhansali and his film are in more difficulty
 kyonki ab iskaa raajnneetik virodh bhi shuru ho gaya he
 State governments from Rajasthan to Madhya Pradesh and UP to Punjab have openly objected to Padmavati
 1
 Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said that if the Censor Board passes the film, it will not be released in the state
 yahaan tak ki unhone padmavati ko rashtramata tak kaa darja de daalaa
 Chauhan has said, 'if the scene is said to be shown against the honor of the nation mother Padmavati ji, by playing with historical facts, the film will not be allowed to be screened on the soil of Madhya Pradesh
 '2
 Uttar Pradesh Deputy CM Aitrajshivraj Singh, besides BJP leader and Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya have also opposed the film

 vot share ke hisaab se dekhen to dakshin bharat main upie or anya dalon kii takkar honi he lekin vot share is maamle main puri kahani nahin kahata
 When this vote share is converted into seats, the real picture is clear

 If other parties are expected to get 30 seats here, then the NDA may have to be satisfied with only 26 seats

 Intelligence Bureau also has input that 7 terrorists of Zakir Musa Group came to Ferozepur
 in aatankiyon ko amritsar main bhi dekha gaya tha
 Only after this, Gurdaspur, Pathankot and surrounding areas were put on high alert
 gurdaspur main musa or uske saathi aatankiyon ke poster diwaron par chaspaan kar die gaye hai
 Common people have been told to tell the police as soon as they get any news about these terrorists

 Far from doing anything, these officers are also responsible for today's crisis
 lekin abhi bhi ummid he
 IOA can be improved
 rashtriya khel sanghon ko bhi sudhara ja saktaa he
 i feel that the participation of players is more important in decision making related to Indian sports
 athlete kamishan bhi banaaya ja saktaa he
 The new constitution of the IOA should contain code of conduct, age and tenure rules
 kamishan ek swatantra sanstha hogi
 The rigging in the electoral process is also a matter of concern
 is herapheri kii misaal tab mili jab hoicourt ne ek khel sangh ke chunaav ko khaarij kar diya
 There were many mistakes in this election
 is tarah kii chijen bhavishya main phir se nahin honi chahie
 The Constitution of the IAO should have an Election Commission
 ab yojana kii safalataa is baat par nirbhar karti he ki is ayog ko kitne prabhavi dhang se lagu karaayaa jaataa he

 ' On the day Anandiben Patel announced her resignation, on prime time, an Ahmedabad journalist Prashant Dayal said that on the basis of how much he understands Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he can say that he enjoys falsifying the media
 jiskaa bhi naam media main nae mukhyamantri ke taur par chalegaa ho saktaa he wo na bane
 Prashant Dayal seems to be right even today
 aaj din bhar gujarat ke nae mukhyamantri ke rup main nitin patel kaa naam chalata rahaa
 The name of Nitin Patel kept on quoting potential candidates and sources
 is bharose ke saath ki shaam ko hone vaali party vidhayak dal main sirf elaan kii aupchaarikta puri kii jaaegi or nitin patel nae mukhyamantri ke rup main saamne aaenge
 But this did not happen
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ek baar phir media ko galat sabit kar diya
 Gujarat BJP President Vijay Rupani will be the new Chief Minister
 aaj subah se channelon par rupani kaa intervyuu nahin chalaa, nitin patel kaa naam aage tha or vahi camaron par the
 Our colleague Rajiv Pathak also interviewed him as a possible candidate
 lekin jab vidhayak dal kii baithak ke baad naam kaa elaan hua to jiskaa naam siem ke liye chal rahaa tha, wo dipti siem banakar baahar niklaa
 Announcing the decision, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said that he would like to thank the media
 prashanth dayaal kii baat yaad aa gai or mujhe hansi aa gai
 Thinking that Nitin Gadkari was not thanking the media because he had made the path of Rupani easy by running the name of Nitin Patel, or because he had not exhausted that the news that had been running all day is now wrong 
 sahi khabar main de rahaa hum
 Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said that Vijay Rupani's name was proposed by Anandiben Patel and Gujarat mlas supported his name
 naam kii ghoshnaa ke baad jo maala pahanaai gai usamen vijay rupani, nitin patel or anandi patel bhi aa gaye
 Anandi Patel also expressed her happiness by creating a Victory Sign with both of them
 party adhyaksh amit shah ne guladasta dekar vijay rupani kaa abhinandan kiya to unhone baqayda donon haath jodakar jhukkar amit shah kaa aabhaar jataayaa lekin jab amit shah guladasta lekar gaye to nitin patel ne khadey khadey sweekaar kiya
 He took the bouquet without bowing
 ho saktaa he in tasveeron kaa kuch matlab na ho magar ye tasviren dilachasp to hai hi
 There was talk in the media that Amit Shah wanted Vijay Rupani to be the chief minister, but Anandiben Patel did not want Vijay Rupani to become the chief minister
 yah khabar apane aap main jatke kii tarah he
 Will a senior minister like Nitin Patel and a leader who knows Gujarat of Modi era very well, start such an ignorance that they start giving interviews at the behest of the media
 kya kabhi nitin patel bataa sakenge ki unhen subah to mukhyamantri ke liye kaha gaya tha yaa unase siem ke taur par intervyuu dekar galati ho gai
 They themselves will not make such a mistake
 patrakaron se zyada bijepi ke vidhayak or mantri jaanate hai ki amit shah or pradhanmantri modi kii style kya he
 Nitin Patel has been a minister since 1995, except from 2002 to 2007
 anandiben patel sarkaar main bhi mahatvapurn mantri rahe
 He had ministries like Health, Education, Roads, Buildings in Anandiben government
 mehsana se vidhayak hai
 Gujarat journalist Prashant Dayal reminds me of the old thing
 kaha ki 90 ke dashak main patel aarakshan kaa bhoot nitin patel ne hi khadaa kiya tha
 He used to unite the Patels by saying that the Congress gave reservation to Chaudhary and Patel remained behind
 magar hardik patel ke netritv main jo patel aarakshan kaa masalaa ubhara usamen nitin patel ne kinaaraa kar liya
 They stayed with power, not with society
 shuukravaar ko din bhar intervyuu dete dete nitin patel ne media ne patel aarakshan or dalit andolan se nipatane ke upaay bhi bataa diye
 Such a senior politician would not set up his house without orders from above
 haalanki unka intervyuu sambhavit ummidavaar ke taur par hi ho rahaa tha magar ve intervyuu to de hi rahe the bhavi siem ke rup main
 For the first time in Gujarat BJP government, someone was made Deputy Chief Minister
 isse pehle congress ke chimanbhai patel kii sarkaar main narhari amin ko up mukhyamantri banaaya gaya tha
 Whether the post of deputy seam is for any balance of power or for Nitin Patel to believe that the blow is fine, too much blow may not be right
 ek varisht vidhayak or mantri ko chhod kar pehali baar vidhayak bane vijay rupani ko mukhyamantri banaaya gaya he
 Interestingly, both Nitin Patel and Vijay Rupani were born in the year 1956
 nitin patel dedh maheenaa bade hai vijay rupani se
 But Patel became one and a half months younger than Rupani in the government
 unke dipti haban gaye

 tippaniyan The political journey of Vijay Rupani is very old
 sarkaar kaa anubhav bhale hi kam ho magar sanghathan kaa khub he
 He has gone to jail in emergency
 2006 se 2012 tak rajyasabha ke sadsy bhi rahe hai
 There has also been Mayor and Councilor of Rajkot
 akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad se jude rahe hai
 Became MLA for the first time by winning the by-election in 2014 as MLA Vajubhaiwala was made the Governor of Karnataka
 pehali baar vidhayak banate hi cabinet mantri ban gaye
 Became Minister of Transport and Water Supply in Anandiben's government
 do saal ke bheetar mukhyamantri banane ja rahe hai
 Degree in law
 24 saal kii umr se hi bijepi main sakriy rahe hai
 Vijay Rupani's wife Anjili Rupani is also associated with Akhil Vidyarthi Parishad
 jab anandiben patel ne istipha diya tab indian express main shila bhatta ne likhaa tha ki gujarat sarkaar main baahar se amit shah kii badhati dakhldanji or rashtriya str par unke badhate prabhaav ke kaaran anandiben ne ye rasta apanaaya taaki ek khaas maukey kaa laabh uthaakar unhen check kiya ja sake
 Anandiben complained that during the Patel and Dalit movements, the party also did not support her
 lekin ant main amit shah kii hi chali
 Vijay Rupani is considered close to Amit Shah
 kuch din pehle vijay rupani ne bayaan diya tha ki mujhe party or sanghathan kaa kaam diya gaya he, isse zyaada mahatvapurn kya ho saktaa he
 This is also my priority
 media ne samajha ki vijay rupani ne khud ko mukhyamantri kii daud se baahar kar liya he
 But all this is meant to be said
 media ko samajhnaa chahie tha
 But when the name was announced after the meeting of the Legislature Party, the person whose name was running for CM, he came out as Deputy CM
 faisle kaa elaan karte hue kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ne kaha ki ve media kaa dhanyavad karnaa chaahate hai
 Prashant Dayal remembered it and made me laugh
 yah soch kar ki kahin nitin gadakari ji media kaa dhanyavad isliye to nahin kar rahe the ki usne nitin patel kaa naam chalaakar rupani kaa rasta aasaan kar diya he yaa isliye to thakyuu nahin kiya ki din bhar jo khabar chalaai he wo ab galat ho chuki he
 i am giving the correct news
 kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ne bataaya ki vijay rupani kaa naam anandiben patel ne prastaavit kiya or gujarat ke vidhayakon ne unke naam kaa samarthan kar diya
 Vijay Rupani, Nitin Patel and Anandi Patel also came in the garland worn after the name announcement
 anandi patel ne bhi donon ke saath victory sin banaakar apni khushi zaahir kii
 When party president Amit Shah greeted Vijay Rupani with a bouquet, he bowed with folded hands and thanked Amit Shah, but when Amit Shah took the bouquet, Nitin Patel accepted the standing ovation
 unhone bina jhuke hi guladasta le liya
 These pictures may not make sense, but these pictures are interesting
 media main yah baat chal rahi thi ki amit shah vijay rupani ko hi mukhyamantri bananaa chaahate hai lekin anandiben patel nahin chaahati thim ki vijay rupani mukhyamantri bane
 This news is a shock in itself
 kya nitin patel jaisaa varisht mantri or modi yug ke gujarat ko rag rag se jaanane vaala netaa aisi naadaani karegaa ki media ke kehane par intervyuu dene lage
 Will Nitin Patel ever be able to tell whether he was asked for Chief Minister in the morning or he made a mistake by giving interview as CM
 wo khud to aisi galati nahin karenge
 More than journalists, BJP mlas and ministers know what is the style of Amit Shah and Prime Minister Modi
 nitin patel 2002 se 2007 ko chhod 1995 se mantri hai

 Vijay Rupani, who became a first-time MLA, has been made the chief minister, leaving a senior legislator and minister
 dilachasp baat ye he ki nitin patel or vijay rupani donon hi 1956 ke saal main paidaa hue hai
 Nitin Patel is one and a half month older than Vijay Rupani
 magar sarkaar main rupani se patel dedh maheenaa chote ho gaye

 When Anandiben Patel resigned, Sheila Bhatt wrote in the Indian Express that due to Amit Shah's increasing interference from outside in the Gujarat government and his growing influence at the national level, Anandiben took this path so that he could take advantage of a special opportunity and check her Can go anandiben ko shikaayat thi ki patel or dalit andolanon ke vakt party ne bhi unka saath nahin diya
 But in the end it was Amit Shah
 vijay rupani amit shah ke kareebi maane jate hai
 a few days ago, Vijay Rupani gave a statement that i have been given the job of party and organization, what could be more important than that
 yahi meri praathamikta bhi he
 The media understood that Vijay Rupani has pulled himself out of the race for chief minister
 magar ye sab to kehane ke liye hota he
 The media should have understood

 ) The CBI raid in the office of its Principal Secretary has been made a question of nose by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 mangalvaar din main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko 'kaayar' bulaane vaale siem ne shaam dhalate-dhalate kaha ki piem ke karm foot gaye hai or unhen desh se maafee maangani chahie
 Kejriwal said that the CBI wants to raid the Chief Minister's files
 mangalvaar shaam aakraamak tewaron ke saath arvind kejariwal ne press conference kii or apane pradhan sachiv rajendra kumaar kaa bachaav kiya
 Kejriwal termed the cbi's arguments as false and said, "CBI and others will be scared by such clutches, Arvind Kejriwal is not afraid
 'jetali kii file dhundh rahe hai piem modiarvind kejariwal ne modi sarkaar or sibiai par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki sabhi milakar unhen pareshaan karnaa chaahate hai ore daraana chaahate hai
 Questioning the CBI investigation, Kejriwal said, 'what files is the CBI looking for in my office today, i tell you
 ye koi bhrashtachar kii file nahin dhundh rahe
 The files they are looking for are from DDCA
 wo arun jetali ko bachaana chaahate hai
 Jaitley is the chairman of DDCA for many years
 hamane DDCA main ho rahe bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jaanch bithai
 i have just received an inquiry report
 ye vahi dhundh rahe hai
 'highlights of Kejriwal's press conference - They are saying that my words are bad
 main to hisar ke paas gaanv se hum
 My words can be bad
 aapke to karm phute hai
 -CBI and other people will be afraid of broken keys, Arvind Kejriwal will not be afraid
 -main modiji se kahana chahta hum ki jab tak saans he main desh kii seva karuunga
 -if these Rajendra Kumar's offices came to expose corruption in the contract, then they would know that a man does not give contracts
 -theke kii file par mantri bhi sin karata he to unke thikaanon par kyon nahin red maari
 - Whoever was a minister in the Sheila government, why was the raid not killed at his home and office? - If you were investigating the cases till 2007-14, then what files were you looking for in the Chief Minister's office
 -waite department par bhi red nahin maari
 The contracts that we are talking about were not raided
 mukhyamantri ke daftar main red maari gai
 It is being said about some old cases of my Principal Secretary that today CBI should raid the Education Department's office if wrong contracts were awarded while being Education Secretary
 desh main nahin aa rahi he pyaaj kii keemton main giravatlalu yadav kaa modi, ramvilas or nitish par tanjatvit kar kaha- piyajva anaar ho gailpure desh main pyaaj kii keemton main badhat dekhne ko mil rahi he
 Despite all the efforts, onion prices are hitting the common man
 pyaaj kii mahangaai thamane kaa naam nahin le rahi he
 Former Bihar chief minister and Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad Yadav has targeted Narendra Modi and the Nitish government over the rising prices of onions
 lalu yadav ne pyaaj kii keemton main ai oochaal par kendriya khaadya aapurti mantri ramvilas paswan ko bhi gheraa he
 Lalu Yadav tweeted that Piyajwa became a pomegranate in Modi, Paswan and Nitish Raj
 lalu yadav kaa ishaara tha ki pyaaj kii keemten anaar kii keemton ke kareeb pahunch gai he
 Onion prices are skyrocketing across the country and people are forced to cry onion
 bihar main bhi pyaaj kii keemat takreeban ₹70 prati kilo se ₹80 prati kilo tak he
 To provide some relief to the common people in such a situation, Bihar State Cooperative Marketing Association Limited (BISCOMAUN) has been providing onion to people at cheap prices for the last few days
 isi bich pyaaj kii badi hui keemton ko lekar aam aadmi party(aap) ne bhi modi sarkaar ko gheraa he
 Aam Aadmi Party leader Sanjay Singh said that the people of Pardesh are crying tears of onion in rising prices of onions
 is desh main 130 rupee prati kilo pyaaj kharidni pad rahi he
 The bjp-ruled central government is responsible for the rising prices of onions
 centre kii sarkaar kalabazriyon se kya sambandh he, iskaa jawaab den
 The Kejriwal government worked to wipe the tears by selling cheap onions, but the BJP is tying up with black marketers and hoarders
 modi-paswan-nitish raaj main phir
 
 pijva anaar ho gail ba
 
 
 - Lalu Prasad Yadav (@laluprasadrjd) November 30, 2019 It is worth noting that Union Food Supply Minister Ram Vilas Paswan recently said that onion prices are increasing worldwide, so it is showing its effect in India as well
 unhone kaha ki pyaaj aayaat karne kebaavjood isaki keemten kam nahin ho paa rahi he
 Please tell that onion is being sold in Delhi at Rs 80 a kg
 ramvilas paswan ne kaha ki videshon se pyaaj kii nai khep aane vaali he or unhen ummid he ki pyaaj ke daam kam honge
 However, even after this statement, onion prices have not seen any decline till now
 misr se aegi pyaaj kii khepagauratlab he ki misr se jald hi 6,090 ton pyaaj kii khep aane vaali he, jiske baad desh main pyaaj ke daam main kami aa sakati he
 This consignment of onions will soon arrive at the Nava Sheva port in Mumbai from where the state governments can purchase onions as per their demand
 somvaar ko kendriya upabhokta maamle,khaadya evam saarvajanik vitaran mantralay ne yah jaankaree di thi
 The government decided to import onion after heavy increase in onion prices in the country due to the loss of onion crop due to heavy rains at the end of monsoon season
 ramvilas paswan ne isi maheene desh main pyaaj kii uplabdhta badhaakar isaki keemton ko kaabo main rakhane ke makasad se ek lakh ton pyaaj kaa aayaat karne kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Traders said that onion prices are increasing due to less arrival than consumption
 shuukravaar ko ajadpur mandi main pyaaj kii aavak 1,045
 6 tonnes, while the daily consumption of onions in Delhi is around 2,000 tonnes
 desh main pyaaj kii khapat 60,000 ton rojaanasarkaar ne pyaaj kii mahangaai ko thaamne ke liye 1
 We have decided to import 2 lakh tonnes of onions, but if you believe the figures of Rajendra Sharma, a businessman of Delhi's Azadpur mandi and president of the Onion Merchant Association, then the country consumes about 50,000-60,000 tonnes daily
 aise main 1
 When 2 lakh tons of onions come from abroad, this will be equivalent to consumption of two days
 is samay kareeb 10 lakh ton pyaaj aayaat karne kii jarurat he or itane bade pariman main pyaaj aayaat kiya janaa mushkil he, kyonki itnaa pyaaj videshon main kahin uplabdh nahin hoga
 Significantly, the government is trying to procure onions from Egypt, Turkey, Holland and other countries and MMTC has also signed contracts for importing onions from Egypt and 6,090 tonnes of onion consignment from Egypt is coming to the country next month

 It helps him avoid punishment
 aadhaar se jodne ke baad, aap bhale hi apana naam badal len lekin aap biomitrix nahin badal sakate hai
 You can neither change the pupil of the eye nor the fingerprint
 aap jab bhi dupliket license ke liye jaaenge to pranali kahegi ki is vyakti ke paas pehle cedriving licensehai or ise nayaa license nahin diya janaa chahie
 Praising the 'digital India' program of the central government, the minister claimed that it has bridged the gap between urban and rural sector

 Significantly, the NDA presidential candidate Ramnath Kovind originally comes from Uttar Pradesh, Ramnath Kovind belongs to the Dalit caste
 kovind ke ummidavaar banaae jane ke baad vipaksh ne bhi dalit card chalate hue purv loksabhaa spikar mira kumaar ko apana ummidavaar banaaya tha

 Explain that the value of the vote of every MP in the presidential election is 708, while the votes of the mlas will be valued according to the population of their states, like the value of the vote of one MLA from Uttar Pradesh is 208, while the votes of the MLA of a less populated state like Arunachal The value of 8 sits

 If you are tired of going to office every day and want to get a leave of ten days a week
 lekin samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki kya bahaanaa banaaen, to ye padhein
 By following these tips, you will also get a holiday and will also avoid the boss
 aaie aapako bataaen bos se bachane ke saat bahaane:1
 Reason: Do not say not to work: Today i do not feel like working
 kya kahen:main offis kii salanaa report par kaam kar rahaa tha
 In the office, the boss wants to see your passion and intention for work, if you are serious about your work, then someday this excuse may come in handy
 2
 Reason: Don't say traffic: Time taken to and fro should also be included in office hours
 kya kahen: kisi dharne / tyohaar / bheed ke jam kaa bahaanaa kiijie, jo hamaare desh main aam baat he
 Traffic is a big problem in the country, they all know that in such a situation, this excuse will reveal something real to the boss
 3
 Reason: Personal problem
 Say no: My hair was wet or my shirt was not press
 kya kahen:mere family member yaa paalatu jaanavar ko doctor ke paas le janaa thaghar ke sadsy yaa paalatu jaanavar kaa bahaanaa banaaie
 The boss is not so bloodthirsty 4
 kaaran: ghar kaa jaruri kamakya naa kahen:mere ghar main aag lag gai thi
 What to say: The water tank started leaking as soon as the mechanic left
 mechanic yaa naukaraani bhi aapke liye behatar dost sabit ho sakate hai
 Just try to use his name once in the office
 5
 Reason: Don't let the alarm go bad: Say these days because of the Olympics, i reset my watch according to foreign time
 kya kahen:bijli na hone ke kaaran meri digital ghadi ne kaam karnaa band kar diya tha, so vakt par alarm nahin baja
 The excuse of electricity is also a good idea to escape
 maheene main ek baar to ise istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 6
 kaaran: chaabi kho janakya naa kahen:meri patni ne majaak main chaabi chhipaakar rakh di
 What to say: My wife mistakenly took the keys of my car with her
 shaq or aarope aapako offis main kai baar bachaa sakate hai
 Bosses get caught up in the stories they create
 7
 Reason: Don't let the car go bad: Say the bees had made a hive on my car
 kya kahen:meri car kaa tair pankchar ho gaya tha
 Car breakdown is a simple excuse
 betry down, ingine kharaab, petrol khatm hone jaise bahaane bos ko yakeen dilaane main madad karte hai
