 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj while inaugurating the Nalanda University on Friday said that it is not a university but a form of traditions that never dies, circumstances sometimes become extinct
 lekin unke aasthaa rakhane vaale log ek din un paramparaon kii shuruyaat dobaaraa jarur karte hai
 The ancient Nalanda University, which started in the sixth century during the Gupta period, was demolished in 1193 AD by the warlord Bakhtiar Khilji of the Turkish ruler Qutbuddin Aibak
 iske avshesh se 12 kilometre kii duuri par is vishvavidhyalay main shikshan kaary gat ek sitambar se hi shuru ho gaya tha
 Inaugurating the Nalanda University at the Convention Center in Rajgir on Friday, Sushma said that she is overwhelmed to come here and this day is a day of great pride for her
 unhone kaha ki purv kii bhaanti yah vishvavidhyalay gyaan ke madhyam se bharat ko puri duniya se jodne ke liye sethu or neenv ke rup main kaam karegaa
 Sushma said that while coming here, on being told by a journalist that she is going to revive the old Nalanda University, we denied that the revival is done to someone who is dead
 unhone kaha, 'aise hi aasthavan logon main ek purv raashtrapati apije abdul kalam shaamil hai jinhone varsh 2006 main kaha tha ki hamen nalanda vishvavidhyalay kii punarsthapana kerani chahie or sanyog dekhie usee varsh ke madhyakaal main singapore ke tatkaaleen videsh mantri george jeeyo ne ek prastaav rakhaa jiskaa naam nalanda prapojal tha
 'nalanda University will be the pride of Asia' Sushma said that faith is not only associated with Bihar and Hindustan but many of our neighboring countries and many East Asia countries want to be a part of Nalanda and a resolution came in 2007 and a resolution was passed in 2009 
 sushamaa ne kaha ki thailand or singapore ke saath kai purvi asia ke deshon ne nalanda kii punarsthapana ko lekar yah kehete hue ruchi dikhaai

 He said, 'with its inauguration today, it is beginning to connect the state with the international world
 isliye jitna bhi gaurav kaa din is pradesh ke logon ke liye he utana hi gaurav kaa din hindustan ke liye he
 Airport to be built in Nalanda On the Chief Minister's wish that he wants to build a big airport in Nalanda, Sushma said that instead of coming here from Patna Airport, tourists and other people should land directly here
 sushamaa ne kaha ki bihar vidhanmandal ne 2007 main is vishvavidhyalay kii punarsthapana ko lekar ek adhinium paarit kiya tha or yah ek rajya vishvavidhyalay banane vaala tha
 The Center thought that this would not be appropriate, so the Ministry of External Affairs adopted it and we started designing it as an Indian university
 unhone kaha ki is vishvavidhyalay ke prati anya deshon kii babbti ruchi ko dekhte hue yah nirnay liya gaya ki use keval bharat kii paridhi se baandhakar rakhana uske saath anyaay karnaa hoga
 In order to reach it in the international world, the Bill related to it was passed in Parliament in 2010 through the Ministry of External Affairs
 sushamaa ne kaha ki sthaneey raajnneeti se dur or dalon kii simaaon ko todakar log iske paksh main bole or iske khilaaf ek bhi bhaashan nakaaratmak nahin hua or sabhi chaahate the ki nalanda kii sthapana hogi to bihar ke saath bharat kaa gaurav badhegaa
 He assured this university of all possible help from the center and said that for this the Government of India has sanctioned Rs
2727 crores to be spent in the next ten years
 sushamaa ne kaha ki ham logon kii koshish hogi adhik se adhik chaatr or behatar shikshak yahaan aaen
 This university should regain its old lost reputation

 On 19 November, the second ballistic missile submarine Aridaman was launched into the water
 raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne ek chote se samaaroh main vishakhapatnam sthit ship building centre (esbisi) ke dryddock main pandubbi ke daine par ek nariyal phoda
 Subsequently, the sbc's dry dock was flooded and the submarine came out with silence
 abhi aridaman ko nausena dwaara desh ko samarpit kiye jane main kam se kam teen saal or lagenge
 But the ceremony did not have the grandeur of the public event as seen in the Arihant submarine in 2009 when it was taken underwater
 belistic missile chhodie kii kshamta vaali nabhikeey pandubbiyon kii shrunkhlaa taiyaar karne kii chaar dashak puraani advanced technology vesal (etivi) pariyojna ab badi teji se aage bad rahi he
 The capacity of the two new units S-4 and S-4 Star will be 1,000 tonnes more than the Arihant class submarines
 ab esbisi dryddock main arihant shrenee kii do pandubbiyon se khaali kii gai jagah ko do nai pandubbiyaan apana lengi
 These submarines will be equipped with eight ballistic missiles i
e
 double the missile weight of Arihant
 inkaa kramshah 2020 or 2022 main jalavataran hoga
 An official says that another reason for Arihant to be unloaded was to make room for assembling S4 and S4 stars in the tight space of SBC
 etivi pariyojna bharat kii sabase mahangi raksha pariyojna he
 India's largest defense program to build four ssbns (classification for submarine equipped with nuclear-powered, ballistic missile) has an estimated cost of Rs 90,000 crore
 bataai jaati he
 Each of these submarines with nuclear power costs Rs 4,000 crore
 se zyada he
 This includes the cost of building the Bhabha Atomic Energy Center (BARC) to build a nuclear power reactor and the cost of preparing submarine-launched ballistic missiles (slbms) from the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO)
 yah pariyojna puure bharat main faili he—mukhyalay dilli main, pandubbi kaa dhaancha taiyaar karne kii ikai gujarat main, missile vikaas kaarykram hyderabad main, parmaanu riector tamilnadu main or antim essembly vishakhapatnam main he
 Thus, it is the largest industrial system in Make in India
 pandubbi ke 60 fisadi kalpurje bharat main hi bane hai
 The submarine is also a major base for strategic cooperation between India and Russia
 varisht adhikari is baat ko sweekaar karte hai ki vistrut roosi dizin or takneekee sahyog ke bina yah pariyojna mumkin nahin ho paati
 Already, the submarine unit has almost doubled the size of its ATV program on 8 December to commemorate the Golden Jubilee, which includes a Rs 60,000-crore project to build six nuclear-powered submarines (ssns)
 nausena pramukh admiral sunil lamba ne esesain pariyojna ke bare main 1 disambar ko media ko bataaya, ''vah shuru ho chuki he
 It is a confidential project
 isaki prakriya shuru ho chuki he
 The design work for the 6,000-tonne indigenous SSN has started at the newly built submarine design center in Gurgaon
 esesain pandubbiyaan paaramparik krooj mixilon or torpeado se las hoti hai lekin ve chalati nabhikeey urja se hai jisase unhen pani ke neeche jabardast gati or kshamta hasil ho jaati he
 The Navy has begun negotiations to acquire another Akula class submarine on lease from Russia for $ 2 billion
 vah ienes chakra kii jagah legi jise uski lij khatm hone ke baad 2022 main lautaa diya jayega
 (currently, the cycle is not working after an accident last August
 ) udhar, 13,500 ton kshamta kii belistic missile pandubbiyon kii nai shrunkhlaa par bhi antim dizin kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 It is named S-5
 ye pandubbiyaan arihant shrenee kii esasbn ke vajan se lagbhag doguni or 12 nabhikeey kshamta vaali mixilon se las hongi
 Earlier this year DRDO gave its green signal to K-6 SLBM project
 yah pariyojna isibm sareekhee 6,000 kilometre kii maarak duuri vaali misile banane kii he
 On the other hand, the work of the first phase of the nuclear project submarine will be completed by 2022

 Thirdly, the nuclear engine allows the submarine to always operate under water
 in injanon ko paaramparik dijal-electric pandubbiyon (esasake) kii tarah badariyon ko charge karne ke liye sataha par nahin aana padataa
 These submarines are protected from the friction of surface waves, so they can also move at high speed under water
 arihant kii hi tarah aridaman bhi ek belistic missile pandubbi yani ki ek buumar he kyonki vah nabhikeey hathiyaaron se las misile lekar chalati hai, isliye ve jameen or hawa ke baad bharat kii maarak kshamta ke trik kaa teesraa paanv ban jaati hai
 Nuclear weapons-equipped marine platforms were included in the draft India's nuclear policy after the May 1998 Pokhran-2 nuclear tests
 ab se paanch maheene baad jab bharat in pareekshanon kii 20veen varshganth manayega to uske paas ek sakriy esasbn or ek jald hi shaamil hone vaali esasbn kii samudr aadhaarit pratirohak kshamta hogi
 Strategic analyst Bharat Karnad says, "the third leg is effective only if you have a submarine always in operation
" hamaare maamle main yah teesraa paanv kuch hi samay parichaalan main hota he—jab arihant baahar nikalati he
 "when an Indian SSBN comes out of Visakhapatnam into the Bay of Bengal, it remains invisible for months in a sense, staying under water
" uski kaabiliyat uske chaalak dal kii kaabiliyat par nirbhar rahati he
 They stay in contact through extremely low frequency (ELF) antennae which are available to them in water
 bamavarshak, mobile missile lanchar, missile train or jameen par tainaat lanchar—inamen se harek kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In this way, submarines are an important part of India's policy of not using nuclear weapons for the first time as they become the default response for us and they are able to psychologically prevent the sudden first attack of any nuclear-powered enemy country
 She lives
 tab ye pandubbiyaan or bhi mahatvapurn hai jab china piele rocket force nabhikeey hathiyaaron se las mixilon se bharat kii mukhya bhoomi ke kisi bhi hisse ko nishaanaa bana saktaa he or bharat ke paas jawaab dene ke liye zyada vikalp uplabdh nahin hai
 Arihant is now equipped with 12 B-05 slbms with a strike distance of 750 km, which means he will have to travel a long way to reach the enemy countries' coast
 philhal, 3,500 kilometre kii duuri tak maar karne vaali 'ke-4' misile pareekshan ke hi daur main hai
 The DRDO will conduct a fourth test of these missiles from a specially designed underwater pontoon launcher in the Bay of Bengal sometime in December
 arihant se ke-4 kaa antim pareekshan bhi bengal kii khadi main hi nikat bhavishya main kiya janaa he
 After that, the K-5 missile will be tested, which is a SLBM with a range of 5,000 km
 is pariyojna kii shuruyaat 2015 main kii gai thi
 All these missiles of Shche series were named by former President A
K
 pi
 J
 abdul kalam ke naam par rakhaa gaya he
 Both K-4 and K-5 can carry weapons weighing two tons
 etivi pariyojna ke bare main jaankaree bahut kam uplabdh he
 It is working directly under the supervision of National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and now there is deep secrecy about it
 nausena kaa prastaav tha ki aridaman ke jalavataran ko haai profile banaaya jaae, jisamen pradhanmantri or cabinet mantri bhi shaamil hon
 But this proposal was rejected by the PMO
 is pariyojna ke liye barti jane vaali suraksha saarvajanik rup se gyaat kisi bhi sainya thikaane kii suraksha kii tulana main sabase zyada he
 Recently, the Navy took over the public road passing near SBC in Visakhapatnam citing security concerns
 aridaman ko pani main utaara janaa teji se badalte bhu-rajnatik ghatnakram ke bich hua he
 The Chinese Navy has expanded and deployed the fastest submarine of any navy since the end of the Cold War
 uskaa pani ke neeche kaa sakriy bal 63 pandubbiyon kaa he—paanch esesain, chaar esasbn or 54 esasake
 It has recently sold eight traditionally diesel and power-driven submarines to Pakistan
 inamen se kam se kam kuch par to parmaanu hathiyaar feet kiye hi jaaenge
 "sea-based deterrence is going to be more important with the passage of time," says Rear Admiral Raja Menon (retd
), Strategic Analyst
 khaastaur par hamaare jaise desh ke liye jisane pehla-istemaal na karne kii niti bana rakhi he
 Your nuclear weapons bases can be traced and if anyone keeps getting information about half of the existing weapon bases every year, then in many years, this information becomes enough
 isse aapaki pratirohak kshamta kaa nuksaan hota he
 The two-month patrol of a Chinese submarine in late 2013 was enough to arouse India's security establishment
 china kii sabase atyaadhunik shang shrenee kii esesain pandubbi 13 disambar, 2013 ko henon dweep main apane garh se nikali or hind mahaasaagar main do maheene kii 'dasyu-rodhi' gasht ke baad 12 farvari 2014 ko laut gai
 RAW, in its evaluation, rated the deployment as highly exacerbating India's security concerns
 tab etivi mukhyalay ne chah swadeshi esesain kii siries taiyaar karne kii yojanaon kii dhul jhaadi jise sarkaar ne bajet kii simaaon kaa hawala dete hue lagbhag ek dashak pehle darkinar kar diya tha
 Then a plan was made to build a series of submarines capable of speeds up to 25 knots and depths up to 500 meters
 esesain darasal vividh bhoomikaaon vaale ladaaku jet kii tarah hoti hai or ve pani ke neeche se ghaatak hamalaa karne vaali hoti hai jaise- nausena kii ienes chakra takreeban 30 note kii raftaar se pani ke neeche chal sakati he jo ki paaramparik dijal-electric ingine pandubbi kii raftaar se lagbhag doguni he
 She can chase warships, hunt and attack coastal targets

 In Tripura, the news of newspapers leaving their editorial pages empty has appeared in Delhi, but the news of the press conference that took place in Delhi on the death of the CBI judge is nowhere to be seen
 jabaki buudhvaar ke press conference main camaron ko dekhakar aapako andaaza ho jayega ki aae the to the itane channel phir bhi wo khabar kahaan gai
 If there is a question about the death of a judge, does not he have the courage to write his news too, then ask yourself one question, why do you pay cable and newspaper bills every month
 kisi mandir main daan kyon nahin kar dete hai itnaa paisa
 Only the poor will be benefited
 hamane saare channel to nahin dekhe magar darshakon ne hi bataaya ki he yah khabar kahin dikh nahin rahi he, sirf press conference main camere nazar aa rahe hai
 Journalists are also seen, yet why is this news not available in English and Hindi newspapers of 23 November
 jajon or vakeelon ko sochna nahin chahie agar unki birdari ke kisi zimmedaar kii maut par sawaal uth jaae or wo chape hi na to phir system ke saamne unki bhi kya haisiyat rah jaati he
 When the lawyers get hurt in the matter, they create a ruckus in the courts of the country, but one judge has died, why is everyone silent
 jaj logon kii apni birdari bhi bharat ke str par kam choti nahin he, ve kyon chup hai
 The newspapers in Tripura have done courage by leaving editorial vacations, Delhi newspapers could not report the single column on the death of a judge
 hamaara loktantr darpoktantr main badal rahaa he
 The result of which the general public will have to suffer
 sibiai to bol sakati thi, jaj brijagopal harimohan loya kii maut par jo sawaal uthe hai, wo to sibiai ke hi special jaj the
 Who is stopping the CBI from speaking
 dilli main vipakshi dalon kii bhi chuppi bataati he ki unki qamar bhi kitni kamazor ho chuki he
 We saw the tweeter handle of Congress leaders p Chidambaram and Manish Tiwari, there is no tweet on the issue even though both are lawyers
 aam aadmi party ke netaa ashutosh ne zarur is par teen twit kiye hai
 Tweeted both Caravan's report and Wire's report as well
 ashutosh ne teen baar twit kiya he or kaha he ki jaj loya kii maut par nishpaksh jaanch honi chahie
 The report raises serious questions that need answers
 sipiem ne ek bayaan jari kiya he
 The revelations in some parts of the media about the circumstances of the death of the CBI judge raise serious questions
 justise loya ke parivaar ne aarope lagaaya he ki sunwaayee ke dauraan rishwat dene kii koshish kii gai he
 There have also been threats
 gujarat chunaav ke kaaran vipakshi dal bolne kii aupchaarikta se aage nahin bad rahe
 Perhaps they have in mind that polarization does not happen on this matter, but the case is about the death of a judge
 kya ek jaj kii maut ko lekar bhi is dar se chup rahaa ja saktaa he, wo bhi jinke naam main shuru se lekar ant brij ke krishna hi hai
 Brijgopal Harimohan Loya
 kair raajnneeti apana samay tay karti rahegi lekin kya yahi majaburi adaalat kii bhi he, kya yahi majaburi kanoon mantralay yaa sibiai kii bhi he
 Retired Justice AP Shah has spoken to our colleague Srinivasan Jain
 justise e pi shah kaa kahana he ki jaj loya kii chhavi ek eemaandaar or sakht jaj kii thi
 Justice AP Shah has said that the Chief Justice of Bombay High Court should investigate the matter
 baat jaanch kii bhi he or jaanch par bharose kii
 When many questions arise, the circumstances of death become suspicious
 in sawaalon ke jawaab jaanch se hi milenge, jiske bare main abhi tak kuch pataa nahin he
 Otherwise, all these questions which seem quite concrete will give rise to unspeakable speculation
 main soch rahaa hum ki wo do jaj kyon nahin bol rahe hai jinhone jaj loya ko nagpur chalane par jor daalaa
 He lived or lived in the same colony where Judge Loya resided and did not meet his family for a month and a half after his death
 kya ve kuch bataa sakate hai
 In the prime time of November 22, i made a mistake
 maine kaha aato main jaj loya ko le jane vaala koun tha, magar usee story main likhaa he ki jaj loya ko do jaj aato main aspataal lekar gaye jo unhen mumbai se nagpur lekar gaye the
 According to sister Anuradha Biyani, the two judges told them this when they came to meet after one and a half months after their death
 jab dil kaa daura padaa tab usee vakt donon jajon ne parivaar ko phone kyon nahin kiya
 One of the two judges could only call
 kya in do jajon ko sarkari guestaouse ravi bhawan main koi gaadi nahin mili, jis viiapi guestaouse main jaj, iees, ipies yaa mantri thaharte hai vahaan ambulance vagairah yaa kaaren to hoti hi hongi
 Was there an ambulance on the campus of the guesthouse at the time? Did they know who was signing Loya's cousin on paper to take the corpse, did they try to find out who was taking it and how it was going
 isliye kitna kuch dhundh hat saktaa he unke saamne aane se
 Therefore investigation is necessary
 tabhi pataa chalegaa ki unhen kya vaaki 100 karod ke rishwat kii peshkash kii gai thi
 The second question is who will investigate
 kiski nigaraanee main hoga
 There is also a question of family safety
 jaj loya ke bete ne 18 farvari 2015 ko ek patr bhi likhaa he jisamen usne apni jaan ko khatara bataaya he
 He wrote that 'I am afraid that these leaders can do any harm to any member of my family and i do not have the strength to fight them
 mujhe dar he ki unke kilaaf hamen kuch bhi karne se rokane ke liye ve hamaare parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Our life is in danger ' In Caravan's story, Judge Loya's father has told Niranjan Takle that he is 85 years old
 mujhe ab maut kaa dar nahin he
 i also want justice but i am very concerned about the lives of my daughters and their children
 niranjan ne likhaa he ki yah bolte hue 85 saal ke pita rone lage
 The questions related to death are dangerous, the silence after the report is scary
 aisa lagata he ki sab dar gaye hai
 Everyone is watching prime time from behind the scenes
 unhen tanaav ho rahaa he
 They want to avoid that the next day nobody asks about it
 dilli main barf kii silli jam gai he
 We are finding out who is speaking on this issue
 bahut mushkil se koi awaz sunai detii he
 BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha today raised this question at the time of the launch of Ali Anwar's book, India's politician Ali Anwar
 newslaundry
 com, scroll

 in, thehoot
 org, mediavigil
 Websites like com are turning to the pages of newspapers that Kis Kis has covered the questions related to the death of Judge Brijgopal Harimohan
 ajeeb vidambnaa he
 Whose name is Krishna, he is wandering among the characters of the Gita, look at the Pandavas or the Kauravas
 dikh to sab rahe hai magar shaayad unki aatma ko kurukshetra kaa maidan hi nahin dikh rahaa he
 You are seeing that if the system wants to raise the question of the death of a CBI judge under the carpet, leave the family unprotected, the system wants to kill the conductor of a bus and make him guilty of murder
 
 ek taraf police ek jaj ke shav ko dryver ke bharose chhod detii he ki vah unke gaanv le jaae
 He does not even suspect that something is wrong
 duusari taraf gurugram kii police bas ke ek conductor par itnaa shaq karti he ki use faansee tak pahunchane kii had tak chali jaati he
 Conducted Ashok, the first accused in the murder of Pradyuman of Rayan School, has alleged that the police has hit him badly
 karant lagaai gai he
 Has been injected
 is dabaav main usne maan liya ki usee ne katl kiya
 When the investigation is changed, only the accused changes
 8 sitambar ko rain skool ke chaatr pradhyumna kii hatya skool ke hi bathroom main kar di jaati he
 Gurgaon Police comes into action and arrests conductor Ashok
 police kahati he conductor ne kabuula he ki hatya usne hi kii he
 But Pradyuman's family is not satisfied with the police investigation
 wo lagaataar sibiai jaanch kii maang karte hai
 Chief Minister Manohar Khattar himself meets the family and orders a CBI inquiry
 sibiai jaanch shuru karti he or police ke daawey kii dhajjiyaan udne lagati he
 The CBI investigation found no evidence against conductor Ashok
 forencik jaanch or sisitivi ko dekhakar police skool ke hi senior class ke chaatr ko giraftaar karti he
 The Juvenile Justice Board is now hearing the case
 tippaniyan The CBI does not oppose the conductor Ashok's bail and gets bail on a personal bond of Rs 50,000
 lekin jail se nikalakar conductor ashok kii haalat dekhakar aap bhi sihar jaaenge
 He is neither able to speak properly nor is able to stand up
 ashok ke mutabik itani buree tarah maaraa gaya jaise usne narak bhoga liya ho
 He stops talking to the journalist
 dard badhane lagata he, usase bolaa nahin jaataa he
 But as much as he has stated, it raises serious questions on how the police works
 bade adhikari ab jaanch kii baat kar rahe hon lekin sawaal ye he ki aakhir kisi aaropee ke saath kya police is tarah kaa bartaav karegi
 Our colleague Sonal Mehrotra spoke to the conductor Ashok and if Ashok is right, then listen to how our police works
 is desh main police sudhaar par supreme court kaa aitihaasik aadesh he lekin hamaare hukmaranon ne use kabhi sahi tareeke se lagu hi nahin kiya, kyonki ye police jab unke haath se nikal jaaegi to phir wo vaisaa shaayad nahin kar paaenge jaisaa wo karte aa rahe hai
 We have become so helpless
 aise hi laachaar bane rahe to ek din aachaar ho jaaenge
 Everything is at the will of the police
 man kiya to kisi ko hatya kaa aaropee bana do, man kiya to kisi aaropee ko bari kar do

 Retired Justice AP Shah has spoken to our colleague Srinivasan Jain
 justise e pi shah kaa kahana he ki jaj loya kii chhavi ek eemaandaar or sakht jaj kii thi
 Justice AP Shah has said that the Chief Justice of Bombay High Court should investigate the matter
 baat jaanch kii bhi he or jaanch par bharose kii
 When many questions arise, the circumstances of death become suspicious
 in sawaalon ke jawaab jaanch se hi milenge, jiske bare main abhi tak kuch pataa nahin he
 Otherwise, all these questions which seem quite concrete will give rise to unspeakable speculation
 main soch rahaa hum ki wo do jaj kyon nahin bol rahe hai jinhone jaj loya ko nagpur chalane par jor daalaa
 He lived or lived in the same colony where Judge Loya resided and did not meet his family for a month and a half after his death
 kya ve kuch bataa sakate hai
 In the prime time of November 22, i made a mistake
 maine kaha aato main jaj loya ko le jane vaala koun tha, magar usee story main likhaa he ki jaj loya ko do jaj aato main aspataal lekar gaye jo unhen mumbai se nagpur lekar gaye the
 According to sister Anuradha Biyani, the two judges told them this when they came to meet after one and a half months after their death
 jab dil kaa daura padaa tab usee vakt donon jajon ne parivaar ko phone kyon nahin kiya
 One of the two judges could only call
 kya in do jajon ko sarkari guestaouse ravi bhawan main koi gaadi nahin mili, jis viiapi guestaouse main jaj, iees, ipies yaa mantri thaharte hai vahaan ambulance vagairah yaa kaaren to hoti hi hongi
 Was there an ambulance on the campus of the guesthouse at the time? Did they know who was signing Loya's cousin on paper to take the corpse, did they try to find out who was taking it and how it was going
 isliye kitna kuch dhundh hat saktaa he unke saamne aane se
 Therefore investigation is necessary
 tabhi pataa chalegaa ki unhen kya vaaki 100 karod ke rishwat kii peshkash kii gai thi
 The second question is who will investigate
 kiski nigaraanee main hoga
 There is also a question of family safety
 jaj loya ke bete ne 18 farvari 2015 ko ek patr bhi likhaa he jisamen usne apni jaan ko khatara bataaya he
 He wrote that 'I am afraid that these leaders can do any harm to any member of my family and i do not have the strength to fight them
 mujhe dar he ki unke kilaaf hamen kuch bhi karne se rokane ke liye ve hamaare parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Our life is in danger ' In Caravan's story, Judge Loya's father has told Niranjan Takle that he is 85 years old
 mujhe ab maut kaa dar nahin he
 i also want justice but i am very concerned about the lives of my daughters and their children
 niranjan ne likhaa he ki yah bolte hue 85 saal ke pita rone lage
 The questions related to death are dangerous, the silence after the report is scary
 aisa lagata he ki sab dar gaye hai
 Everyone is watching prime time from behind the scenes

 They want to avoid that the next day nobody asks about it

 Congress and BJP have not shown any activism on the questions raised about the death of CBI Special Court Judge Brijgopal Harimohan Loya
 tripura main akhabaaron ke apane sampadakeey pannon ke khaali chhodane kii khabar dilli main chhapi he magar dilli main sibiai jaj kii maut ko lekar jo press conference hua he, uski khabar kahin nazar nahin aa rahi he
 While looking at the cameras in Wednesday's press conference, you will have an idea that there were so many channels, yet where did that news go? ek jaj kii maut ko lekar sawaal hon, kya uski bhi khabar likhane kii himmat nahin bachi he to ek sawaal aap khud se puuchhie ki har maheene cabel or akhbaar kaa bill kyon dete hai
 Why don't you donate so much money to a temple
 kisi garib kaa bhala hi ho jayega
 We did not see all the channels but the viewers told that this news is not visible anywhere, only the cameras are being seen in the press conference
 patrkaar bhi nazar aa rahe hai phir bhi 23 november ke angrezi or hindi akhbaaron main yah khabar kyon nahin he
 Judges and lawyers should not think if the question arises on the death of someone responsible in their community and that is not printed, then what is their status in front of the system
 baat baat main vakeelon ko thes pahunchati he to ve desh kii adaalaton main hangaamaa machaa dete hai magar ek jaj kii maut hui he, sab chup kyon hai
 Judge's own community is also not small at the level of India, why are they silent
 tripura ke akhbaaron ne sampadakeey khaali chhod kar saahas kaa kaam kiya he, dilli ke akhbaar ek jaj kii maut par single kalam kii khabar nahin laga paae
 Our democracy is turning into cowardice
 jiskaa nateeja aam janata ko hi bhugatna hoga
 The CBI could have spoken, the questions that have arisen on the death of Judge Brijgopal Harimohan Loya were special CBI judges
 sibiai ko bolne se koun roak rahaa he
 The silence of the opposition parties in Delhi also shows how weak their waist has also become
 hamane congress ke netaa pi chidambaram or manish tiwari kaa twitor handle dekha, is masale par koi twit nahin he jabaki donon hi vakil hai
 Aam Aadmi Party leader Ashutosh has made three tweets on this
 kairavaan kii donon report ko twit kiya he or vir kii report ko bhi
 Ashutosh has tweeted three times and said that there should be a fair inquiry into the death of Judge Loya
 report gambhir sawaal khadey karti he jiske jawaab zaruri hai
 The CPM has issued a statement
 media ke kuch hisson main sibiai jaj kii maut kii paristhitiyon ko lekar jo khulaase hue hai wo gambhir sawaal khadey karte hai
 Justice Loya's family has alleged that bribes were tried during the trial
 dhamkee bhi di gai he
 Due to the Gujarat elections, the opposition parties are not moving ahead with the formalities of speaking
 shaayad unke man main yah he ki is maamle ko lekar dhruvikaran na ho jaae lekin maamla to ek jaj kii maut kaa he
 Can one be kept silent about this fear of the death of a judge, who is also Krishna in the name of Braj from the beginning to the end
 brijagopal harimohan loya
 Well politics will keep its time, but is this compulsion of the court also, is it the compulsion of the Law Ministry or the CBI as well
 ritair justise e pi shah ne hamaare sahyogi shrinivasana jain se baat kii he
 Justice AP Shah says that Judge Loya's image was that of an honest and strict judge
 justise e pi shah ne kaha he ki bambe hai court ke mukhya nyaayadhish ko is maamle kii jaanch kerani chahie
 It is also a matter of investigation and trust in investigation
 jab bahut saare sawaal uth jaaen to maut kii paristhityaan sandigdh ho jaati hai
 The answers to these questions will be found only by investigation, about which nothing is known yet
 varanaa ye saare sawaal jo kaaphi thos lagate hai naahak atakalon ko janm denge
 i am wondering why those two judges are not speaking who insisted on Judge Loya to go to Nagpur
 ve usee colony main rahete hai yaa the, jahaan jaj loya rahete the phir unki maut ke dedh maheene tak unke parivaar se nahin mili
 Can they tell something? 22 november ke prime time main mujhase ek chook hui
 i said who was going to take Judge Loya in Auto, but in the same story it is written that two judges took Judge Loya to the hospital in Auto who took him from Mumbai to Nagpur
 bahan anuraadhaa biani ke anusaar donon jajon ne unhen yah baat bataai, maut ke dedh maheene baad jab ve milane aae the tab
 Why did the two judges not call the family at the same time when they had a heart attack
 do jajon main se ek to phone kar hi sakate the
 Did these two judges not find any vehicle in the government guest house Ravi Bhawan, in which the Viap guesthouse where judges, IAS, IPS or ministers stay, there would be ambulances etc
 or cars
 kya us vakt guestaouse ke campus main ambulance tha? kya unhen pataa tha ki shav ko lene ke kaagazat par loya kaa chachera bhai banakar koun dastakhat kar rahaa tha, kya unhone pataa karne kii koshish kii ki shav koun le rahaa he or kaise ja rahaa he
 So how much mist can be removed from them
 isliye jaanch zaruri he
 Only then will he know whether he was actually offered a bribe of 100 crores
 doosraa sawaal yah he jaanch koun karegaa
 Under whose supervision
 ek sawaal parivaar kii suraksha kaa bhi he
 Judge Loya's son has also written a letter on 18 February 2015 in which he has declared his life at risk
 usne likhaa he ki 'mujhe dar he ki ye netaa mere parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy ko koi nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai or mere paas inase ladane kii takat nahin he
 i am afraid that they may harm any member of our family to prevent us from doing anything against them
 hamaari zindagi khatare main he
 ' kairavaan kii story main jaj loya ke pita ne niranjan taakale se kaha he ki ve 85 saal ke ho chuke hai
 i no longer fear death
 main insaaf bhi chahta hum lekin mujhe apni bacchiyon or unke bacchon kii jaan kii behad phikr he
 Niranjan has written that the father of 85 years started crying while speaking this
 maut se jude sawaal khataranaak to he hin, report ke baad kii chuppi daraavnee he
 It seems that everyone is scared
 sab parde ke peeche se prime time dekh rahe hai
 They are stressed
 wo bachanaa chaahate hai ki agle din koi is bare main puch na le
 There is a freezing of snow in Delhi
 ham khoj rahe hai ki is masale par koun kahaan bol rahaa he
 Hardly any sound is heard

 Strange irony
 jiske naam main krishna he wo gita ke kirdaaron ke bich bhatak rahe hai, pandavon kii taraf dekhen yaa kauravon kii taraf
 Everyone is visible, but perhaps their soul is not seeing the field of Kurukshetra
 aap dekh rahe hai ki system chaahe to sibiai ke jaj kii maut ke sawaal ko kaaleen ke neeche sarka de, parivaar ko asurakshit chhod de, system chaahe to ek bas ke conductor ko maar maar kar adhamra kar de or usase hatya kaa gunaah kabool karvaa le
 On one hand, the police leave the body of a judge on the basis of the driver to take them to their village
 use shaq tak nahin hota ki kuch gadabad he
 Gurugram police, on the other hand, suspect so much of a conductor of the bus that he goes to the extent of leading him to the gallows
 reyaan skool ke pradyuman kii hatya ke maamle main pehle aaropee banaae conductor ashok ne aarope lagaaya he ki police ne buree tarah maaraa he
 Current has been imposed
 injection diya gaya he
 Under this pressure, he confessed that he committed murder
 jaanch jab badali jaati he to aaropee hi badal jaataa he
 On September 8, Pradyuman, a student of Ryan School, is killed in the bathroom of the school itself
 gudgaanv police acshan main aati he or conductor ashok ko giraftaar kar leti he
 Police say the conductor confessed that he had committed the murder
 lekin pradhyumna kaa parivaar police jaanch se santusht nahin hota he
 They constantly demand a CBI inquiry
 khud mukhyamantri manohar khatter parivaar se milte hai or sibiai jaanch kaa aadesh dete hai
 The CBI begins an investigation and the police claim begins to fly
 sibiai kii jaanch main conductor ashok ke kilaaf saboot nahin mili
 Seeing the forensic investigation and CCTV, the police arrest the senior class student of the school
 juvenil justise board ab is maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 The comments conductor ashok kii zamaanat kaa sibiai virodh nahin karti or use 50,000 rupee ke nijee muchalke par zamaanat mil jaati he
 But after getting out of jail, you will also see the conductor Ashok's condition
 wo naa sahi se baat kar paa rahaa he or naa hi khadaa ho paa rahaa he
 According to Ashok, he was killed so badly as if he had consumed hell
 wo patrkaar se baat karte karte ruk jaataa he
 The pain begins to increase, it is not spoken
 lekin jitna usne bataaya he wo police ke kaam karne ke tareeke par gambhir sawaal paidaa karata he
 The elder officers are now talking about investigation, but the question is, what police will treat such an accused after all
 hamaari sahyogi sonal mehrotra ne conductor ashok se baat kii or agar ashok kii baat sahi he to suniye hamaari police kis tarah kaam karti he
 There is a historic order of the Supreme Court on police reform in this country, but our rulers never implemented it properly, because when these police get out of their hands, then they might not be able to do what they have been doing
 ham sab kitne laachaar ho chuke hai
 If you remain helpless like this, then one day there will be ethics
 sab kuch police kii marji par he
 If you want, make someone accused of murder, if you want, acquit someone
 jabaki buudhvaar ke press conference main camaron ko dekhakar aapako andaaza ho jayega ki aae the to the itane channel phir bhi wo khabar kahaan gai
 If there is a question about the death of a judge, does not he have the courage to write his news too, then ask yourself one question, why do you pay cable and newspaper bills every month
 kisi mandir main daan kyon nahin kar dete hai itnaa paisa
 Only the poor will be benefited
 hamane saare channel to nahin dekhe magar darshakon ne hi bataaya ki he yah khabar kahin dikh nahin rahi he, sirf press conference main camere nazar aa rahe hai
 Journalists are also seen, yet why is this news not available in English and Hindi newspapers of 23 November
 jajon or vakeelon ko sochna nahin chahie agar unki birdari ke kisi zimmedaar kii maut par sawaal uth jaae or wo chape hi na to phir system ke saamne unki bhi kya haisiyat rah jaati he
 When the lawyers get hurt in the matter, they create a ruckus in the courts of the country, but one judge has died, why is everyone silent
 jaj logon kii apni birdari bhi bharat ke str par kam choti nahin he, ve kyon chup hai

 main soch rahaa hum ki wo do jaj kyon nahin bol rahe hai jinhone jaj loya ko nagpur chalane par jor daalaa
 He lived or lived in the same colony where Judge Loya resided and did not meet his family for a month and a half after his death
 kya ve kuch bataa sakate hai
 In the prime time of November 22, i made a mistake
 maine kaha aato main jaj loya ko le jane vaala koun tha, magar usee story main likhaa he ki jaj loya ko do jaj aato main aspataal lekar gaye jo unhen mumbai se nagpur lekar gaye the
 According to sister Anuradha Biyani, the two judges told them this when they came to meet after one and a half months after their death
 jab dil kaa daura padaa tab usee vakt donon jajon ne parivaar ko phone kyon nahin kiya
 One of the two judges could only call
 kya in do jajon ko sarkari guestaouse ravi bhawan main koi gaadi nahin mili, jis viiapi guestaouse main jaj, iees, ipies yaa mantri thaharte hai vahaan ambulance vagairah yaa kaaren to hoti hi hongi
 Was there an ambulance on the campus of the guesthouse at the time? Did they know who was signing Loya's cousin on paper to take the corpse, did they try to find out who was taking it and how it was going
 isliye kitna kuch dhundh hat saktaa he unke saamne aane se
 Therefore investigation is necessary
 tabhi pataa chalegaa ki unhen kya vaaki 100 karod ke rishwat kii peshkash kii gai thi
 The second question is who will investigate
 kiski nigaraanee main hoga
 There is also a question of family safety
 jaj loya ke bete ne 18 farvari 2015 ko ek patr bhi likhaa he jisamen usne apni jaan ko khatara bataaya he
 He wrote that 'I am afraid that these leaders can do any harm to any member of my family and i do not have the strength to fight them
 mujhe dar he ki unke kilaaf hamen kuch bhi karne se rokane ke liye ve hamaare parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Our life is in danger ' In Caravan's story, Judge Loya's father has told Niranjan Takle that he is 85 years old
 mujhe ab maut kaa dar nahin he
 i also want justice but i am very concerned about the lives of my daughters and their children
 niranjan ne likhaa he ki yah bolte hue 85 saal ke pita rone lage
 The questions related to death are dangerous, the silence after the report is scary
 aisa lagata he ki sab dar gaye hai
 Everyone is watching prime time from behind the scenes
 unhen tanaav ho rahaa he
 They want to avoid that the next day nobody asks about it
 dilli main barf kii silli jam gai he

 dikh to sab rahe hai magar shaayad unki aatma ko kurukshetra kaa maidan hi nahin dikh rahaa he
 You are seeing that if the system wants to raise the question of the death of a CBI judge under the carpet, leave the family unprotected, the system wants to kill the conductor of a bus and make him guilty of murder

 He does not even suspect that something is wrong
 duusari taraf gurugram kii police bas ke ek conductor par itnaa shaq karti he ki use faansee tak pahunchane kii had tak chali jaati he
 Conducted Ashok, the first accused in the murder of Pradyuman of Rayan School, has alleged that the police has hit him badly
 karant lagaai gai he
 Has been injected
 is dabaav main usne maan liya ki usee ne katl kiya
 When the investigation is changed, only the accused changes
 8 sitambar ko rain skool ke chaatr pradhyumna kii hatya skool ke hi bathroom main kar di jaati he
 Gurgaon Police comes into action and arrests conductor Ashok
 police kahati he conductor ne kabuula he ki hatya usne hi kii he
 But Pradyuman's family is not satisfied with the police investigation
 wo lagaataar sibiai jaanch kii maang karte hai
 Chief Minister Manohar Khattar himself meets the family and orders a CBI inquiry
 sibiai jaanch shuru karti he or police ke daawey kii dhajjiyaan udne lagati he
 The CBI investigation found no evidence against conductor Ashok
 forencik jaanch or sisitivi ko dekhakar police skool ke hi senior class ke chaatr ko giraftaar karti he
 The Juvenile Justice Board is now hearing the case
 tippaniyan The CBI does not oppose the conductor Ashok's bail and gets bail on a personal bond of Rs 50,000
 lekin jail se nikalakar conductor ashok kii haalat dekhakar aap bhi sihar jaaenge
 He is neither able to speak properly nor is able to stand up
 ashok ke mutabik itani buree tarah maaraa gaya jaise usne narak bhoga liya ho
 He stops talking to the journalist
 dard badhane lagata he, usase bolaa nahin jaataa he
 But as much as he has stated, it raises serious questions on how the police works
 bade adhikari ab jaanch kii baat kar rahe hon lekin sawaal ye he ki aakhir kisi aaropee ke saath kya police is tarah kaa bartaav karegi
 Our colleague Sonal Mehrotra spoke to the conductor Ashok and if Ashok is right, then listen to how our police works
 is desh main police sudhaar par supreme court kaa aitihaasik aadesh he lekin hamaare hukmaranon ne use kabhi sahi tareeke se lagu hi nahin kiya, kyonki ye police jab unke haath se nikal jaaegi to phir wo vaisaa shaayad nahin kar paaenge jaisaa wo karte aa rahe hai
 We have become so helpless
 aise hi laachaar bane rahe to ek din aachaar ho jaaenge
 Everything is at the will of the police
 man kiya to kisi ko hatya kaa aaropee bana do, man kiya to kisi aaropee ko bari kar do
 Due to the Gujarat elections, the opposition parties are not moving ahead with the formalities of speaking
 shaayad unke man main yah he ki is maamle ko lekar dhruvikaran na ho jaae lekin maamla to ek jaj kii maut kaa he
 Can one be kept silent about this fear of the death of a judge, who is also Krishna in the name of Braj from the beginning to the end
 brijagopal harimohan loya
 Well politics will keep its time, but is this compulsion of the court also, is it the compulsion of the Law Ministry or the CBI as well
 ritair justise e pi shah ne hamaare sahyogi shrinivasana jain se baat kii he
 Justice AP Shah says that Judge Loya's image was that of an honest and strict judge
 justise e pi shah ne kaha he ki bambe hai court ke mukhya nyaayadhish ko is maamle kii jaanch kerani chahie
 It is also a matter of investigation and trust in investigation
 jab bahut saare sawaal uth jaaen to maut kii paristhityaan sandigdh ho jaati hai
 The answers to these questions will be found only by investigation, about which nothing is known yet
 varanaa ye saare sawaal jo kaaphi thos lagate hai naahak atakalon ko janm denge
 i am wondering why those two judges are not speaking who insisted on Judge Loya to go to Nagpur
 ve usee colony main rahete hai yaa the, jahaan jaj loya rahete the phir unki maut ke dedh maheene tak unke parivaar se nahin mili
 Can they tell something? 22 november ke prime time main mujhase ek chook hui
 i said who was going to take Judge Loya in Auto, but in the same story it is written that two judges took Judge Loya to the hospital in Auto who took him from Mumbai to Nagpur
 bahan anuraadhaa biani ke anusaar donon jajon ne unhen yah baat bataai, maut ke dedh maheene baad jab ve milane aae the tab
 Why did the two judges not call the family at the same time when they had a heart attack
 do jajon main se ek to phone kar hi sakate the
 Did these two judges not find any vehicle in the government guest house Ravi Bhawan, in which the Viap guesthouse where judges, IAS, IPS or ministers stay, there would be ambulances etc
 or cars
 kya us vakt guestaouse ke campus main ambulance tha? kya unhen pataa tha ki shav ko lene ke kaagazat par loya kaa chachera bhai banakar koun dastakhat kar rahaa tha, kya unhone pataa karne kii koshish kii ki shav koun le rahaa he or kaise ja rahaa he
 So how much mist can be removed from them
 isliye jaanch zaruri he
 Only then will he know whether he was actually offered a bribe of 100 crores
 doosraa sawaal yah he jaanch koun karegaa
 Under whose supervision
 ek sawaal parivaar kii suraksha kaa bhi he
 Judge Loya's son has also written a letter on 18 February 2015 in which he has declared his life at risk
 usne likhaa he ki 'mujhe dar he ki ye netaa mere parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy ko koi nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai or mere paas inase ladane kii takat nahin he
 i am afraid that they may harm any member of our family to prevent us from doing anything against them
 hamaari zindagi khatare main he
 ' kairavaan kii story main jaj loya ke pita ne niranjan taakale se kaha he ki ve 85 saal ke ho chuke hai
 i no longer fear death
 main insaaf bhi chahta hum lekin mujhe apni bacchiyon or unke bacchon kii jaan kii behad phikr he
 Niranjan has written that the father of 85 years started crying while speaking this
 maut se jude sawaal khataranaak to he hin, report ke baad kii chuppi daraavnee he
 It seems that everyone is scared
 sab parde ke peeche se prime time dekh rahe hai
 They are stressed
 wo bachanaa chaahate hai ki agle din koi is bare main puch na le
 There is a freezing of snow in Delhi
 ham khoj rahe hai ki is masale par koun kahaan bol rahaa he
 Hardly any sound is heard

 com jaisi website akhabaaron ke panne palat rahi hai ki kis kis ne jaj brijagopal harimohan kii maut se jude sawaalon ko cover kiya he, chapa he
 Strange irony
 jiske naam main krishna he wo gita ke kirdaaron ke bich bhatak rahe hai, pandavon kii taraf dekhen yaa kauravon kii taraf
 Everyone is visible, but perhaps their soul is not seeing the field of Kurukshetra
 aap dekh rahe hai ki system chaahe to sibiai ke jaj kii maut ke sawaal ko kaaleen ke neeche sarka de, parivaar ko asurakshit chhod de, system chaahe to ek bas ke conductor ko maar maar kar adhamra kar de or usase hatya kaa gunaah kabool karvaa le
 On one hand, the police leave the body of a judge on the basis of the driver to take them to their village
 use shaq tak nahin hota ki kuch gadabad he
 Gurugram police, on the other hand, suspect so much of a conductor of the bus that he goes to the extent of leading him to the gallows
 reyaan skool ke pradyuman kii hatya ke maamle main pehle aaropee banaae conductor ashok ne aarope lagaaya he ki police ne buree tarah maaraa he
 Current has been imposed
 injection diya gaya he
 Under this pressure, he confessed that he committed murder
 jaanch jab badali jaati he to aaropee hi badal jaataa he
 On September 8, Pradyuman, a student of Ryan School, is killed in the bathroom of the school itself
 gudgaanv police acshan main aati he or conductor ashok ko giraftaar kar leti he
 Police say the conductor confessed that he had committed the murder
 lekin pradhyumna kaa parivaar police jaanch se santusht nahin hota he
 They constantly demand a CBI inquiry
 khud mukhyamantri manohar khatter parivaar se milte hai or sibiai jaanch kaa aadesh dete hai
 The CBI begins an investigation and the police claim begins to fly
 sibiai kii jaanch main conductor ashok ke kilaaf saboot nahin mili
 Seeing the forensic investigation and CCTV, the police arrest the senior class student of the school
 juvenil justise board ab is maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 The comments conductor ashok kii zamaanat kaa sibiai virodh nahin karti or use 50,000 rupee ke nijee muchalke par zamaanat mil jaati he
 But after getting out of jail, you will also see the conductor Ashok's condition
 wo naa sahi se baat kar paa rahaa he or naa hi khadaa ho paa rahaa he
 According to Ashok, he was killed so badly as if he had consumed hell
 wo patrkaar se baat karte karte ruk jaataa he
 The pain begins to increase, it is not spoken
 lekin jitna usne bataaya he wo police ke kaam karne ke tareeke par gambhir sawaal paidaa karata he
 The elder officers are now talking about investigation, but the question is, what police will treat such an accused after all
 hamaari sahyogi sonal mehrotra ne conductor ashok se baat kii or agar ashok kii baat sahi he to suniye hamaari police kis tarah kaam karti he
 There is a historic order of the Supreme Court on police reform in this country, but our rulers never implemented it properly, because when these police get out of their hands, then they might not be able to do what they have been doing
 ham sab kitne laachaar ho chuke hai
 If you remain helpless like this, then one day there will be ethics
 sab kuch police kii marji par he
 If you want, make someone accused of murder, if you want, acquit someone
 baat jaanch kii bhi he or jaanch par bharose kii
 When many questions arise, the circumstances of death become suspicious
 in sawaalon ke jawaab jaanch se hi milenge, jiske bare main abhi tak kuch pataa nahin he
 Otherwise, all these questions which seem quite concrete will give rise to unspeakable speculation

 But as much as he has stated, it raises serious questions on how the police works
 bade adhikari ab jaanch kii baat kar rahe hon lekin sawaal ye he ki aakhir kisi aaropee ke saath kya police is tarah kaa bartaav karegi
 Our colleague Sonal Mehrotra spoke to the conductor Ashok and if Ashok is right, then listen to how our police works

 We have become so helpless

 Everything is at the will of the police

 ajeeb vidambnaa he
 Whose name is Krishna, he is wandering among the characters of the Gita, look at the Pandavas or the Kauravas
 dikh to sab rahe hai magar shaayad unki aatma ko kurukshetra kaa maidan hi nahin dikh rahaa he
 You are seeing that if the system wants to raise the question of the death of a CBI judge under the carpet, leave the family unprotected, the system wants to kill the conductor of a bus and make him guilty of murder
 
 ek taraf police ek jaj ke shav ko dryver ke bharose chhod detii he ki vah unke gaanv le jaae

 The Juvenile Justice Board is now hearing the case
 tippaniyan The CBI does not oppose the conductor Ashok's bail and gets bail on a personal bond of Rs 50,000
 lekin jail se nikalakar conductor ashok kii haalat dekhakar aap bhi sihar jaaenge
 He is neither able to speak properly nor is able to stand up

 Strange irony

 Everyone is visible, but perhaps their soul is not seeing the field of Kurukshetra
 aap dekh rahe hai ki system chaahe to sibiai ke jaj kii maut ke sawaal ko kaaleen ke neeche sarka de, parivaar ko asurakshit chhod de, system chaahe to ek bas ke conductor ko maar maar kar adhamra kar de or usase hatya kaa gunaah kabool karvaa le
 On one hand, the police leave the body of a judge on the basis of the driver to take them to their village

 court ne kaha ki abhiyojan paksh yah sabit karne main asamarth rahaa ki us raat khan hi gaadi chalaa rahe the or unhone haadase ke vakt sharaab pi rakhi thi
 At the same time, the court also rejected the testimony of Ravindra Patil, an eyewitness and Salman's body guard, stating that Khan was the only one driving and not obeying despite repeated warnings

 bhopal: saahitiyik patrakarita kaa kaary he- tehre hue samaaj ko saans or gati dena
 Welcome to the society that is about to be formed
 nayi rachanashiltaa or nayi pratibhaaon ko saamne laana saahitiyik patrakarita kii jaruri shart he
 This idea was written by senior litterateur Dr
 vijay bahadur singh ne 11wein pan
 Brijlal Dwivedi expressed at the All India Literary Journalism Awards ceremony
 varisht aalochak dow
 While presiding over the function, Vijay Bahadur Singh said that literature becomes the hallmark of your consciousness
 bharat kii ek pahchaan yah bhi he ki yahaan ramayana, mahabharat or gita likhi gayi
 At that time Rama and Krishna were the heroes of our literature and in today's society people like Dasharatha Majhi are our heroes
 saahitiyik patrakarita ke madhyam se aise nayakon ko saamne laane kaa kaary hona chahie
 He said that many collectible issues of literary magazines come out, but if these magazines are not able to extract new creativity and new talent, then we must assume that these magazines are becoming the storeroom of literature
 soshal media kii uplabdhta ke kaaran badi sankhya main dikh rahe lekhakon kaa zikr karte hue dow
 Singh said that due to social media in the literary world a terrible democracy has come, dealing with it is also necessary for literary journalism
 kyonki likhane kaa kaushal rakhane vaala prayek vyakti sahityakar nahin ho jaataa
 He said that truth should be protected in literary journalism
 jamaana sirf unhen hi yaad rakhata he jo sach ke saath rahete hai or sach kii raksha karte hai
 As the keynote speaker at the function, narrator Mukesh Verma said that literary journalism has always been marginalized and could never get the status of political journalism, but such events are important steps in establishing literary journalism
 unhone kaha ki pandit brijlaal dvivedi sammaan se sammanit lekhakon par yah prashn koi nahin uthaa saktaa ki unhen sammaan kaise praapt hua? ab tak ke sabhi chayan shreshth hai
 Referring to the work of respected author Arun Tiwari, Verma said that we all should read 'prerna'
 is avasar par arun tiwari ne kaha ki kisi bhi vyakti ko jab puraskaar yaa sammaan miltaa he to use acha lagata he, kintu sukhad aashcharya tab hota he jab vah puraskaar anayas ho
 The purpose of starting inspiration was that all the magazines till now were written and read by litterateurs
 deshbhar main prakhyat kai aise lekhak hai, jinaki pehali rachana prerana main prakashit hui
 He said that literature and journalism complement each other
 kyonki samaaj main jo hamaare aasapaas hota he vahi sahitya he
 The only difference between the two is that in literature the writer adds his own opinion, whereas in journalism, there is a commitment to present the event as it is
 unka daawa tha ki hamaare yahaan anek udhaaharan hai, jinase yah sabit hota he ki patrakarita yadi sahitya se mil jaae to vaicharik kranti kaa janm hota he
 He told that in this magazine we have never taken commercials nor will we ever take the chief guest
 sudhir saxena ne kaha ki samaaj ke hit main saahitiyik patrakarita kii mashaal ko jalaae rakhana behad jaruri he
 In this era of marketism, literary journalism is a very difficult task
 jo bhi saahitiyik patrakarita kar rahaa he, use sambal, samarthan or sahyog karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 Giving many examples, he said that Madhya Pradesh has a rich tradition of literary journalism
 ratlam jaisi choti jagah se ek samay main saat saahitiyik patrikaayen prakashit hoti thim
 Arun Tiwari, editor and senior litterateur of literary magazine 'prerna', was decorated with eleven thousand rupees, shawl, quince, emblems and letters of honor at the function organized by media interaction at Mohania Hall of Gandhi Bhavan
 is avasar par mukesh verma, girish pankaj, arvind tiwari or media vimarsh ke sampadak dow

 Today is the birthday of Sourav Ganguly, who took Indian cricket to new heights during his captaincy
 aaiye jaanate hai, inke bare main kuch suni-ansuni baaten
 1) Sourav Ganguly used to bat with the right hand in his childhood, but his elder brother Snehasish was a left-handed batsman
 isliye apane bade bhai kaa samaan istemaal karne ke liye ganguli ne baayen haath se ballebaazi shuru kii
 He became the first player from India to bat with left hand and bowl with right hand
 2) bachapan main saurav ganguli kaa sabase pasandida khel cricket nahin balki footbaal tha
 He has always been a big fan of Brazilian player Pelé and, like Pelé, he played on his school team at the striker's position
 aaj bhi ganguli kehete hai ki vah cricket se zyaada footbaal dekhnaa pasand karte hai
 When the Indian Super League of Football started in India, Ganguly created one of his teams, Atlético de Kolkata
 3) har koi jaanata he ki australia kii team main mark wo ko jagah tab mili jab unke bade bhai steve wa ko drop kiya gaya
 Something similar happened in the Bengal team as well
 saurav ganguli ko team main shaamil karne ke liye unke bade bhai snehashish ko team se drop kiya gaya
 There was talk in favor of Chhote Ganguly that he could bowl as well
 4) ganguli 1996 main surkhiyon main aae, lekin vah 1992 main team india kaa hissaa the, jo australia ke daure par thi
 In his first ODI, Ganguly scored only 3 runs and due to this poor performance, he did not get a second chance on the tour and was then dropped from the team
 khabaren ye bhi ain ki ganguli ne apane senior khilaadiyon ke prati sammaan nahin dikhaaya or maidan par drinks le jane se manaa kar diya haalanki aaj tak ganguli is baat kaa khandan karte hai
 5) After four years out of the team, Ganguly made his return to England tour in 1996 and scored a century in his first Test match
 unhone apni duusari pari main bhi shatak banaaya or apni debyue series main main of da series kaa puraskaar jeeta
 Seeing his best shots outside the off stump, Rahul Dravid said that Ganguly plays after the most brilliant God outside the off stump
 6) england ke kaamyaab daure ke baad saurav ganguli apni bachapan kii garlfrand donna ke saath ghar se bhaag gaye
 They also got married secretly
 donon pariwaron ne pehle to is shaadi kaa virodh kiya, lekin baad main sahamat hokar 21 farvari 1997 main donon kii shaadi karvaa di
 7) Sourav Ganguly, along with Sachin Tendulkar, formed a salute pair that changed the appearance of Indian cricket
 donon ne vanade main 6609 ran jode
 49
 32 kii ausat se or bharat hi nahin, balki duniya kii sabase kaamyaab vanade jodiyon main ise gina jaataa he
 8) Celebrating the natwest Trophy victory by removing Sourav Ganguly's T-shirt on the balcony of Lord's ground is one of the golden moments of Indian cricket
 darasal, kuch maheene pehle bharat main hui vanade series jeetne ke baad england ke andryu flintoff ne kuch aisa hi jashn manaaya tha
 Ganguly answered this in the Lords
 bataur captain ganguli ne bhartiya cricket kii soch ko badla or virodhiyon kii aankh main aankh daalkar har baat kaa jawaab diya
 The comments 9) 2005 main saurav ganguli or greg chapel ke bich jaisaa vivaad bhartiya cricket ne pehle kabhi nahin dekha tha
 Sourav Ganguly played a big role in making Greg Chappell the coach, but Chappell's first target was Sourav Ganguly
 chapel ne bataur captain or khilaadi ganguli ko anfit qaraar diya tha
 Dada was about to leave the team on a beach tour, but the rest of the team, including Sachin, prevented Ganguly from doing so
 10) aaj ganguli cricket camentry karte hai or yahaan bhi unka dabadabaa he
 In world cricket, Ganguly's talk is still taken seriously and very few people are able to express their opinions more than Ganguly
 unhone bengali bhashaa main ek sho bhi kiya tha- 'dadagiri' jo ki behad kaamyaab rahaa
 1) Sourav Ganguly used to bat with the right hand in his childhood, but his elder brother Snehasish was a left-handed batsman

 Sourav Ganguly played a big role in making Greg Chappell the coach, but Chappell's first target was Sourav Ganguly
 chapel ne bataur captain or khilaadi ganguli ko anfit qaraar diya tha
 Dada was about to leave the team on a beach tour, but the rest of the team, including Sachin, prevented Ganguly from doing so
 10) aaj ganguli cricket camentry karte hai or yahaan bhi unka dabadabaa he
 In world cricket, Ganguly's talk is still taken seriously and very few people are able to express their opinions more than Ganguly
 unhone bengali bhashaa main ek sho bhi kiya tha- 'dadagiri' jo ki behad kaamyaab rahaa
 2) Sourav Ganguly's favorite sport in childhood was not football but football
 vah hameshaa brazil ke khilaadi pele ke bahut bade fain rahe hai or pele kii tarah hi vah striker kii pozishan par apni skool team se khelte the
 Even today, Ganguly says that he prefers watching football more than cricket
 jab bharat main footbal kii indian super lig shuru hui to ganguli ne apni ek team atletico di kolkata khadi kii
 3) Everyone knows that Mark Voe got a place in the Australian team when his elder brother Steve Waugh was dropped
 bengal kii team main bhi kuch aisa hi hua
 His elder brother Snehasish was dropped from the team to include Sourav Ganguly in the team
 chote ganguli ke paksh main yah baat rahi ki vah gendbaazi bhi kar sakate the
 4) Ganguly made headlines in 1996, but he was part of Team India in 1992, which was on a tour of Australia
 apane pehle vanade main ganguli ne sirf 3 ran banaae or is kharaab pradarshan ke chalate unhen daure par doosraa mauqaa nahin mila or fir team se baahar kar diya gaya
 There were also reports that Ganguly did not show respect for his senior players and refused to take drinks on the field, although to this day Ganguly denies this
 5) chaar saal team se baahar rahane ke baad ganguli ne 1996 main england ke daure par apni vaapasi kii or apane pehle hi test match main shatak jadaa
 He also scored a century in his second innings and won the Man of the Series award in his debut series
 of stump ke baahar unke behtareen shots ko dekhte hue rahul david ne bayaan diya ki of stump ke baahar sabase shandaar bhagwaan ke baad ganguli khelte hai
 6) Sourav Ganguly runs away from home with his childhood girlfriend Donna after a successful England tour

 Both the families opposed this marriage at first, but later agreed and got both married on 21 February 1997
 7) sachin tendulkar ke saath milakar saurav ganguli ne ek aisi salaami jodi banaai, jisane bhartiya cricket kii surat badalakar rakh di
 Both added 6609 runs in odis

 8) lords maidan kii balakani par saurav ganguli kaa tii-shart nikaalkar natwast trophy kii jeet kaa jashn manaanaa bhartiya cricket ke sabase sunahare lamhon main se he
 In fact, Andrew Flintoff of England celebrated something similar after winning the ODI series in India a few months ago
 ganguli ne lords main iskaa jawaab de diya
 As captain, Ganguly changed the thinking of Indian cricket and responded to everything by putting eyes in the eyes of the opponents
 tippaniyan 9) The controversy between Sourav Ganguly and Greg Chappell in 2005 was never seen by Indian cricket before
 greg chapel ko coach banane main saurav ganguli kii hi badi bhoomika thi, lekin chapel ke sabase pehle nishane par saurav ganguli hi aae
 Chappell had described Ganguly as captain and player unfit
 dada bich daure par hi team chhodane vaale the, lekin sachin samet team ke baaki khilaadiyon ne ganguli ko aisa karne se roka
 10) Today Ganguly does cricket commentary and he also dominates here
 vishwa cricket main ganguli kii baat ko aaj bhi gambhirtha se liya jaataa he or bahut kam log ganguli se zyaada bebaak tareeke se apni raay rakh pate hai
 He also did a show in Bengali language- 'dadagiri' which was very successful
 3) har koi jaanata he ki australia kii team main mark wo ko jagah tab mili jab unke bade bhai steve wa ko drop kiya gaya
 Something similar happened in the Bengal team as well

 The government has issued an order saying that the process of giving respect fund to those arrested under MISA will be reconsidered
 is par ab rivyuu hone ke baad hi agle maheene kaa maandey jari kiya jayega
 The government's argument about stopping MISA pension is that the money being spent is more than the allocated budget
 isliye misa kii vartmaan prakriya ko rokkar ise sateek or paardarshee banaaya jayega
 Apart from this, physical verification of democracy soldiers will be done

 It is worth noting that when Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was in power in Madhya Pradesh, democracy fighters have been given 25 thousand rupees every month as an honor fund
 vahiin, immergency ke dauraan ek din ke liye bhi jail gaye logon ko sammaan ke rup main aath hajaar rupee die jate rahe hai
 Why did you get 25 thousand rupees

 a post shared by URVASHI RAUTELA 🇮🇳actor (@urvashirautela) on May 18, 2018 at 10:48am PDT US President Barack Obama has emphasized the need to start a new series of economic reform programs in India, saying that there are restrictions on the entry of foreign companies in many sectors, including retail market in the country and the American companies due to bad investment environment
 Getting worried aisi bate kehane ke baavjood bhartiya arthvyavastha ke prati america raashtrapati kaa vishwaas bana hua he
 He also described the current growth rate of India's economy as 'influential'
 unhone kaha ki bharat kii vruddhi dar main haal main dikhi narmi vishwa arthvyavastha main vyapak narmi kaa pratibimb he
 In an interview to PTI, the US President answered a wide range of questions about the economy of India and the world
 saath hi unhone bharat-pakistan sambandhon, asia prashanth kshetra main america ranneeti ke bare main bhi bolaa
 In the talks, Obama took care not to directly criticize the investment climate in India
 unhone is vishay main kaha ki america ke company jagat kaa kahana he ki use bharat main nivesh ke vaataavaran main giravat ko lekar chintaa he
 The US President said, "those people (people of American companies) say that investing in India is still a very difficult task
" bharat ne khudara kaarobaar jaise anek kshetron main videshi nivesh par simaaen laga rakhi he yaa unamem videshi nivesh varjit he
 He said that such investment is necessary to increase employment opportunities in both the countries and it is also necessary to keep India on the path of economic growth
 ’obama ne bharat kii aarthik kathinaaiyon ko dur karne ke liye kisi tarah ke hal kaa suzav dene se bachate hue kaha, ‘yah america kaa kaam nahin he ki vah bharat sahit anya deshon ko unke aarthik bhavishya ke bare main suzav de
 Obama said that there seems to be a consensus in India that this is probably the right time to start another round of economic reforms in the country
 isse bharat vaishvik arthvyavastha main adhik pratispardhi ban sakegaa
 The US President further said, 'india will always be accompanied by an ally of America, where it will move forward on difficult but necessary reforms
 ’unhone baatcheet ke dauraan is baat kaa ullekh kiya ki bharat ne karodon logon ko garibi se ubaara he or ab vahaan ke madhya varg kii aabaadi duniya main apane varg kii sabase badi aabaadi he
 Obama said, 'indian innovation is the engine of the global economy

 The Indian people have shown excellent ability to meet challenges
 america raashtrapati ne kaha ki bharat ke liye kathin samajhe jane vaale aarthik sudhaar kaarykram lagu karnaa jaruri he

 girish bapat ne aage kaha ke kisi kii bhi sarkaar satta main aae, koi bhi party satta praapt kare, kisaanon ko madad karnaa unka param kartavya he
 And for this reason, the BJP government has given a loan waiver of 34000 thousand crores for the needy farmers

 aakhirkaar varsha prabhavit lords test kaa nateeja england ke paksh main rahaa
 On the first day of the match, after the rain fell on the fourth day, Team India suffered a crushing defeat by an innings and 159 runs at the hands of England
 barish ke kaaran pehle din ek bhi gend nahin phenki ja saki, jabaki baaki din bhi barish kii aankh michauli chalati rahi
 Virat Brigade's embarrassing defeat in England, losing the innings 0–0 backward in the series, England did not lose the Test match when the day before the rain could not be played at the historic Lord's ground
 yah chatha mauka tha, jab lords main barish kii vajah se pehle din kaa khel dhulaa
 Of which it was England's third win, with three draws
 aisa 17 saal baad hua, jab aitihaasik lords ke maidan par kisi test kaa pehla din barish kii vajah se nahin ho paaya
 On May 17, 2001, the last day of the Test match against Pakistan was rained down
 england ne vah test match tisare hi din pari or 9 ranon se jeet liya tha
 After the defeat in the Lord's Test, Virat assumed - When did the rain in the Lord's Test with the wrong team, when the first day's game was washed out due to rain, the result-1954: England vs Pakistan (failed to play the first three days)
 - Draw 1964: Ashes - England vs Australia (failed to play the first two days), Result - Draw 1978: England vs Pakistan, Result - England won 1997: Ashes - England vs Australia - Result - Draw 2001: England vs Pakistan (england won) 2018: England Vs India (england won) mumbai ke mumbra or kalava railway stesan ke bich ek train puri raftaar se daud rahi he lekin is local train main saikadon musafiron ke saath ek aisa ladkaa bhi he, jiskaa makasad kisi khaas manzil tak pahunchnaa nahin, balki kuch or he
 And the aim is to do that dangerous stunt in a moving train, which can make the color stand up
 ek aisa stant, jisamen kaamyaab rahane kaa matlab agar jindagi he
 So failure only means death
 kyonki chalati train main anjaam diya ja rahaa ye wo stant he, jisamen second aadhe hisse kii galati bhi jaanaleva sabit ho sakati he
 Here, the speed of the train is steadily accelerating and the 15-year-old boy is hanging in a fearless and neglectful way with the handle outside the door
 or uske dost use roak nahin rahe, balki uski is harakat kaa video bana rahe hai
 The train is passing by electric poles one by one at full speed and the boy is swinging at the door, sometimes in and out
 darasal, khel khud ko khambhe se bachaane kaa he
 When the door of the train approaches the pillar, the boy comes in at a rapid pace, and as soon as the pole is released, the boy starts hanging again
 maut ke is khel main wo kabhi donon haathon se latak rahaa he, to kabhi ek haath se hi apane doston ke bich dilari kii galatfahami pesh kar rahaa he
 Meanwhile, the train enters a tunnel and along with the entire train, it is also lost in the dark, but then the same sequence starts as the train comes out of the tunnel but in the meantime, thinking about what happens Even the soul shivers
 achaanak ladke kaa haath handle se phisalata he or pal bhar main wo chalati train se neeche gir jaataa he or ladke ne maukey par hi dam tod diya
 The boy, who suffered an accident during a stunt on August 9, the day of Eid, was named Muhammad Raza, who came out of the house to talk with his friends
 magar, ab wo kabhi laut kar nahin aayega
 We request all boys like Raza that life is very valuable, so do not play with death

 That is, every 4000 people are coming under the train and dying
 lekin phir bhi log aise haadason se sabak nahin lete
 However, 4 to 5 people are caught doing such stunts daily
 lekin unhen 100 yaa 500 rupee jurmaana lekar chhod diya jaataa he
 Surprisingly, most young boys carry out such activities
 12veen class main padhane vaala ishwar or camel apane do doston monu or rohit ke saath gajiabad ke link road ilaake main railway trek par gum rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, the four friends decided that they would stand on the track and make videos on mobile with the train coming from the front
 iraadaa ye tha ki tasviren saamne se aati tej raftaar train ke behad kareeb se utaari jaaen
 After this, Rohit took over the mobile and Ishwar, Monu and Kamal stood in the middle of the same track on which the train was to come
 ittefaq se us vakt saamne se sialdah rajdhani aa rahi thi or wo bhi puri raftaar se
 After this, all those who took pictures and took pictures were so engrossed that they did not realize that the train had come very close to them and then by the time the three friends standing on the track, it was late
 rajdhani express unhen kuchalate hue nikal gai
 Ishwar and Monu succumbed on the spot, while Kamal later broke into the hospital
 rohit ko haalanki kuch nahin hua lekin teen-teen doston kii ankhon ke saamne maut ne use sadame main pahunchaa dipha he
 This life-long game has been played on the railway track of Ghaziabad for a long time, but neither the district administration nor the railways nor the children of children care about it
 jaahir he aise afsosna haadason ko rokane kii jimmedaari sabhi kii he

 jab bos kaa chillaanaa ban jaae daily routine, to yun rakhen khud ko coolswikaar karen apni galatrugar sach main apni galatiyon se siikhnaa chaahate hai to sabase pehle galtiyaan sweekaar karnaa seekhen
 Doing so will be the first step towards learning
 hamaare andar itnaa saahas hona chahie ki ham apni galatiyon ko dusron ke saamne sweekaar kar saken
 Try not to make excuses and defend yourself to avoid mistakes

 Apply for a new job, avoid these mistakes in your resume
 Improve your work
 If your mistakes are constantly coming forward then obviously you need to improve
 sabase pehle ye samajhane kii koshish karen ki aapse galati kahaan hui he or phir hal nikaalane kii koshish karen
 Not trying to correct a mistake after making a mistake is equivalent to making a mistake again

 pichley saal ke mukaable badi paraali jalaane kii samasyis saal 51 dinon ke dauraan 48,684 jagah paraali jalaane ke maamlepunjab main bhale hi supreme court kii fatkaar ke baad paraali jalaane ko lekar sakhti ho rahi ho lekin iske baavjood agar pichley saal 2018 kii tulana main is saal 2019 ke ant tak maamalon par najar daali jaae to paraali jalaane ke maamalon main 12 fisadi kii badhotaree hui he
 Last year, there were 43,339 stubble burning cases from September 23 to November 12
 vahiin is saal 2019 main in 51 dinon ke dauraan 48,684 jagah paraali jalaane ke maamle report kiye gaye hai
 If we talk about the last 24 hours, only on Tuesday, 113 cases have been reported in Sangrur, 69 in Bathinda, 97 in Barnala, 42 in Ludhiana, 54 in Mansa, 70 in Patiala and 27 places in Moga while others have been reported burning
 Matters of stubble burning are continuously coming up in the districts
 sirf pichley 24 ghante main hi rajya main 145 kisaanon par paraali jalaane ko lekar cese bhi darj kiya gaya he
 In comparison to 2018, so far in 2019, except for Fazilka in Punjab, the number of cases of stubble burning has increased compared to this year
 halaat aise ho gaye hai ki punjab ke pramukh shaharon kaa air quality index bhi khatarnaak str par pahunchaa hua he
 AQI of pollution has reached till Bathinda 359, Patiala 313, Mandi Govindgarh 251, Khanna 246
 haalanki, punjab sarkaar ne kisaanon par thodi sakhti karne kii baat kahi he lekin kisaanon ne saaf kar diya he ki jab tak paraali se nipatane ke liye kisaanon ko sansaadhan or aarthik madad muhaiyaa nahin karwaai jaati tab tak wo paraali kaa koi thos samaadhaan nahin kar sakate hai
 In the Gharachon village of Bhawanigarh, Punjab, the farmers were taken hostage by two officers who came to take action on burning the stubble, after which the police team reached the spot and rescued the two officers after a lot of hard work
 punjab ke mansa main bhi kisaanon ne apane saathi kisaanon par paraali jalaane kii vajah se darj kiye gaye maamalon ke virodh main mansa disi daftar ke baahar joardaar pradarshan kiya
 The farmers say that they will continue to perform like this till the cases registered against the burning of stubble are withdrawn
 punjab sarkaar kaa kahana he ki supreme court ke nirdeshon ke baad paraali jalaane vaale kisaanon par sarkaar kii ore se sakhti kii ja rahi he lekin kai aise chote kisaan hai jinke paas rajya sarkaar kii sabsidi ke baavjood bhi paraali kaa prabandhan karne vaali mashine kharidne ke liye paisa nahin he or wo kisaan majaburi main paraali ko aag laga dete hai
 Sadhu Singh Dharmasot, the cabinet minister of the Punjab government, once again put the ball in the court of the central government and said that till the central government does not give funds to the Punjab government to provide financial help to the farmers, then they will solve the stubble with the farmers
 Can not get it done completely
 sadhu singh ne kaha ki jo kisaan paraali jalaane kii jid par ade hai or karrwai karne vaale adhikariyon ko bandhak bana rahe hai or dharne pradarshan kar rahe hai, un kisaanon ko bhi sarkaar samajha-bujhaakar sahi raste par laane kii koshish main lagi he
 This year, in the areas where more cases of stubble burning have been reported, special monitoring is being done on those areas and it is being ascertained that why farmers there are stubborn to insist on burning stubble and accordingly, The state government will try to resolve this

 Mallya tweeted, 'I want to respectfully ask why the Prime Minister does not instruct banks to accept the offer to return my money? He can then claim at least credit for the full recovery of the loan given to Kingfisher, 'mallya also claimed in the tweet that he had made an offer to settle the case even before the Karnataka High Court
 Following on from my earlier tweet, i respectfully ask why the Prime Minister is not instructing his Banks to take the money i have put on the table so he can at least claim credit for full recovery of public funds lent to Kingfisher
 In another tweet, Mallya said, 'media reports citing ED that i have hidden my property

 Now i will appeal
 Am appalled to say the least at the media reports on the Enforcement Directorate claims that i hid my wealth ! If there was hidden wealth how could i put approximately 14,000 crores worth of assets openly in front of Court ? Shameful misleading of public opinion but unsurprising
 Action is to be taken against Mallya in a Rs 9,000 crore fraud and money laundering case in India

 This was a major success for India in its efforts to bring back Mallya

 In view of the rapidly growing population and housing problem, it was decided to build a cemetery site in Juhu, Mumbai and one of the tombs dug for it was also of the great playback singer Mohammad Rafi
 mumbai ke interior diziner roopesh ne bataaya ‘‘mumbai main awaas kii vikaraal samasya he
 That is why it was decided to build a building on the site of the cemetery at Juhu
 iske liye vahaan kabren khodi gayi jinamein rafee, naushaad, madhubala aadi kii kabren bhi thim
 Rupesh was one of those who applied for the interiors of this building, but he did not get this job
 rafi fain club chalaane vaale binu nair kehete hai ‘‘ab ham rafi kii kabr ke sameep khadey nariyal ke ek ped ke sameep ekatra ho kar unhen shradhanjali dete hai
 "on 31 July 1980, Rafi, who called this world off with a heart attack, gave his voice to almost every big star of Hindi films
" unhen 1965 main padmashri se sammanit kiya gaya
 In Bollywood, Rafi started the song Yodeling during the playback singing by changing the pitch repeatedly
 unke kuch puraane geet ‘hello sweet seventine’ ‘o chale ho kahaan’, ‘dil ke aaine main’ or ‘unase rippi tippi ho gayi’ iske udhaaharan hai
 Born on 24 December 1924, Rafi's singing talent was recognized by his maternal uncle and then Rafi learned classical music from Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Ustad Wahid Khan, Pandit Jivanlal Mattoo and Firoz Nizami
 lahore se 1944 main rafee mumbai aae or naushaad ke saath gayan kaa safar tathaa dosti kaa ek atoot rishta shuru hua
 Naushad's choice at first was Talat Mehmood, but later Naushad was so fond of Rafi that the pair gave 149 songs
 inamen 81 geet rafi ke solo the 
 From the 1950s to the 1960s, Rafi continued to be the favorite singer of composers such as OP Nayyar, Shankar Jaikishan and SD Burman
 varsh 1945 main ‘‘laila majanu’’ ke liye rafee ne ‘‘tera jalawaa jisane dekha’’ gaaya or screen par bhi najar aae
 After the partition of the country in 1947, Rafi's song "here Badla Wafa Ka" with Nur Jahan became very popular
 rafi bharat main hi rahe
 In the year 1948, Rafi sang the song 'suno Suno Ae Duniya Valo Bapu Ki Amar Kahani' written by Rajendra Krishna
 yah geet sun kar tatkaaleen pradhanmantri pan jawaharlal nehru ne rafee ko aamantrit kiya
 Rafi narrated this song to him at Nehru's house
 isi saal swatantraaa diwas par nehru ne rafi ko rajat padak pradaan kiya
 Rafi, who won five National Film Awards and six Filmfare Awards, breathed his last on 31 July 1980 leaving behind a rich legacy of songs
 bollywood abhinayta or bijepi saansad paresh rawal ne haal hi main ek vivaadit twit kiya tha
 After a lot of controversy, he deleted that tweet
 unhone kaha he ki twitor ne us twit ko delit na karne par acount delit karne kii dhamkee di thi
 Paresh Rawal has released a letter which reads, "through this letter, i want to tell all my supporters and citizens of the country that Twitter has threatened to delete the account if my tweet on May 21 is not deleted from me
" He has defended his tweet in his letter and said that he will continue to defend his deleted tweet
 darasal paresh rawal ne 21 may ko kiye gaye ek twit main kaha tha, ‘arundhati roy ko army jeep par baandh dena chahie’
 This tweet was made last month in the context of using a Protester in Kashmir as an army shield against the stonemasons
 unhon twit kiya or kaha ki patharbaajon ke bajaae arundhati raay ko army jeep main baandh dena chahie
 It is being told that before Paresh Rawal's remarks, there was news on some Pakistani channels that Arundhati Roy had gone to Kashmir after the incident of tying a Kashmiri youth on a jeep and there she gave a statement in support of Pakistan
 jabaki arundhati kaa kahana he ki vah is bich kabhi kashmir gai hi nahin
 Significantly, Twitter has suspended the account of singer Abhijeet Bhattacharya
 unhone haal hi main kai twit karke mahilaon par abhadra tippanee kii thi
 After this, famous singer Sonu Nigam has deleted his Twitter account supporting him
 unhone delit karne se pehle 24 twit kiye or kaha ki twitor par lagbhag 90 fisadi log aisi bhishaa kaa istemaal karte hai to twitor unke acount suspend kyon nahin karata
 After the Pulwama attack, the way the whole world stood with India against terrorism, it was expected that China's opinion about terrorist kingpin Masood Azhar will change now
 sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main wo masood ajahar ko global tebrist ghoshit kiye jane kaa samarthan karegaa
 So that the screws on Masood Azhar can be tightened completely
 magar pichley teen baar kii tarah chauthi baar bhi china se dhokhaa hi mila
 But now China's opinion about Masood Azhar suddenly changed
 ab china masood azhar ko nahin bachaayegaa
 Now he has said that the issue of Masood will be resolved soon in the United Nations
 china ne achaanak ye kah kar pakistan kii mushkilen badha di hai ki masood azhar ko lekar wo bharat kii chintaa samajhataa he or masood kaa masalaa abhi khatm nahin hua he
 China's Ambassador to India, Luo Zhahui has assured that Masood Azhar's case in the UN will be resolved soon
 unhone kaha ki masood kaa maamla abhi technical hold par rakhaa gaya he
 It is the same China that has so far been using the veto in the UN Security Council four times to prevent Masood Azhar from being declared a global terrorist
 magar ab chautarafa dabaav ke baad pehali baar china ne masood ke bare main is tarah kii baaten kahi hai
 Maulana Masood Azhar is the culprit of more than twenty terrorist attacks in India in the last 16 years, killing hundreds of innocents and one of the most consummate terrorists in the world
 vahi masood azhar jiske sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ko 18 saal pehle 2001 main hi sanyukt raashtra sangh ne aatankwaadi sanghathan qaraar de diya
 But look amazing, that even after 18 years, the United Nations is not able to decide whether the organization whose organization is terrorist should be declared as terrorist by the organization? There is a very old saying in India
 ek haath de
 Take a hand
 magar ye kahawat china ke raste pakistan pahunchate pahunchate badalane lagati he
 China uses this saying a little with Pakistan
 yani ek haath de or kai haath le
 Understand this Chinese style of Hindustani proverbs in easy words
 iskaa matlab ye he ki aatank ke maamle main to china duniya ke patal par pakistan kii beizzati hone se bachaa legaa
 But Pakistan will have to repay his favor
 or ye badla thodaa chini style main hoga
 We will explain you one by one what is the change of Chinese style
 magar pehle ye jaaniye china ne antarrashtriya birdari ke saamne kaise rakh lee pakistan kii laaj
 China again helped terrorist Masood Azhar
 yuan main global aatanki ghoshit hone main daalaa roda
 This is the fourth time China has done this move on Masood Azhar in 10 years
 or masood ajahar ko bachaane ke liye vito lagaaya
 For the last 18 years
 
 That is, from the 2001 Parliament attacks to the 2019 Pulwama attack
 pakistan kaa ye khoonkhaar aatanki ek ke baad ek bharat ko kai zakhm de chukaa he
 All the countries of the world believed that this kingpin of Jaish is a threat to the whole of humanity
 lihaaza ise global terrarist ghoshit kiya janaa chahie taaki aatank par nakel kasi ja sake
 But for the last 10 years, China has been shielded by this kingpin of terror
 or jab-jab bharat ne ise global tebrist list main daalane kii koshish
 Then and again China obstructed the UN Security Council
 haalanki pulavama hamale ke baad is baar 27 farvari ko ye prastaav france, britain or america laayaa tha
 More than 10 countries supported the proposal
 tay kiya gaya ki agar suraksha parishad ke kisi sadsy ko is par aitaraaz naa hua to
 Jaish leader Masood Azhar will be declared an international terrorist
 is lihaaz se prastaav kii samay seemaa buudhvaar yani 13 march raat 12:30 baje khatm ho rahi thi
 It felt like Masood would get punished for what he had done
 magar prastaav kii samay seemaa khatm hone se thik ek ghante pehle
 China put a block on it
 china ne kaha ki wo pehle bhi kah chukaa he ki bina sabooton ke karrwai galat he
 On which America requested China to act wisely
 kyonki bharat-paak main shanti ke liye masood ko vaishvik aatanki ghoshit karnaa jaruri he
 Another attempt to declare Masood Azhar as an international terrorist was thwarted after China's obstruction
 haalanki is prastaav par adnge ke baad suraksha parishad ke sadasyon ne china ko saaf chetavanee di he ki agar wo masood azhar ko lekar apane rukh ko nahin badalegaa to karrwai ke duusare vikalp bhi khule hai
 In total, China has done the trick four times in the last 10 years to save Masood Azhar
 2009 main bharat khud ye prastaav lekar aayaa tha
 At the same time, in 2016, India proposed the P-3 i
e
 America, France and Britain together
 2017 main pi-3 deshon ne hi ye prastaav pesh kiya tha
 And this time also after the Pulwama terror attack, this proposal was brought with France, Britain and America
 haalanki is baar china ne is prastaav ko giraane ke liye vito power kaa istemaal nahin kiya he, balki sutron ke mutabik china ne prastaav ko ‘technical hold’ par rakhaa he
 a technical hold means he needs some more time to consider the proposal
 is lihaaz se aisa nahin he ki masood azhar ke sir par lataki antarrashtriya aatanki ghoshit hone kii talwaar hat gai he
 Whatever the result, but now China's new statement about Masood Azhar raises hopes
