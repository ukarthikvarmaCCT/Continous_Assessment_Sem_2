 During this series, it is also understood that the National Accreditation Council (NAC) system for grading colleges is also insufficient and unsuccessful
 surat kii ek shikshika ne kaha ki hamaare shahar main nack kii team aati he to unhen sari or mithai kaa dibba dekar bhejnaa hota he
 In many places, Naik's team also does a good job
 par nack or reating se kya hoga, kya aapako pataa chalegaa ki falaan college main 70 fisadi professor nahin hai
 The future of ten thousand to ten thousand students is being wasted by taking admission fees
 magar yah masalaa zaruri nahin he
 The idol should be made
 suna he netaa log zehar pine lage hai
 The nectar that millions of students of India have drank by going to university has immortalized the courage of our systems and the students are shabby
 yah pankti tabhi samaj aegi jab aap ise chaar baar padhenge or paanch baar sunenge
 The comments universti ke shikshakon ke liye ek khushi kii khabar he
 It is not that bad systems do not bring happiness
 aati hai or aati rahengi
 The seventh pay commission has arrived in the life of the professors, congratulations
 centrel uniwarsity, state universti or aded college ke shikshakon kaa vetan badha he
 This announcement showed that there are 7 lakh, 58 thousand professors in India
 kaash yah bhi pataa chal jaataa ki bharat main kitne lakh professor nahin hai
 Salary is important, because the remaining professors and lecturers work hard to teach, especially as we have seen at Delhi University, our teachers used to study at home for 5-5 hours everyday to teach us
 tab hamen pehali baar pataa chalaa tha ki padhaane ke liye padhanaa bhi padataa he
 Those who do not teach do the essential work of the principal or the ruling party
 wo bhi raashtra nirmaan kaa hi kaam he
 Nation building is a bigger task than student building
 ummid he khaali padon par bhi ek press conference hogi
 Which will explain how the restoration process will be transparent
 sattarudh dal kaa jhola uthaane waalon kii nahin, padhane waalon ko naukari milegi
 Now go from Rajasthan to Jharkhand
 ranchi uniwarsity kaa haal lete hai
 Ranchi University has been in operation since July 12, 1960
 aaj iske tahat 64 college hai
 There are 23 post graduate departments
 do lakh chaatr hai, naujavaanon kii itani jaagruk aabaadi jis universti main ho, vahaan to loktantr or vyavasthaaon ke chaal-chalan main swarna yug hi aa janaa chahie
 But even the students of Ranchi University, it seems that after three years somehow they are waiting for the degree, not the professor in the class
 yahaan ke khaali padon par sidhe bahaali honi chahie thi magar 1982 ke baad se hui hi nahin
 You are going into 21st century, Ranchi University is stuck in 20th century itself
 assistant professor pramotion paakar associat profasar phir profasar ban kar ritair hote gaye, siten khaali hoti gayi 
 Here the teacher is placed on the contract
 research scollar class lete hai
 Professors have to do administrative work as non-teaching staff are not recruited for these jobs
 mujhe is baat par shaq he ki bahut se chaatro ko pataa he ki unke professor ko padhaane ke liye padhanaa bhi padhata he
 Neither the professor tells nor the student asks
 sabko lagata he ki professor computer hai, on kar do, padhaanaa chaalu, isliye inase admician bhi karaao, mantri kaa swaagat bhi karaao or niabandh lekhan pratiyogita kaa incharge bhi banaao
 This is Ramlakhan Singh Yadav College of Ranchi University
 koker ilaake main yah college he, 100 kattha zamin par bana he
 Since the 80s, there has been a judicial dispute over the college's land
 yah college hamaari nyaayik prakriya kii bhi misaal he
 In 40 years, this case has not reached its end
 college main bhi kisi ne sakriyata nahin dikhaai
 There cannot be a new construction here due to the stay of the Supreme Court
 yahaan par inter se lekar grajuation ke 9500 chaatr padhate hai
 With the introduction of the choice based credit system, the need of teachers in every subject has increased
 is vakt kisi bhi vishay ke liye ek yaa do se zyaada lekturer nahin hai
 According to the new system, this college needs about 150 teachers, but according to the old system, there are only 38
 itihaas main 300 chaatro ne admician liya he magar teacher ek hi hai
 There are eight hundred students in commerce, but only 3 teachers to teach
 haalat yah he ki shikshak class le yaa imtahaan le yaa kapi check kare
 There is a three-three, four-month exam and then a copy check
 shikshak kehete hai ki phir bhi ham log padhaa lete hai, magar aap samaj sakate hai ki kya padhai hoti hogi
 The college attracts children from rural areas around Ranchi
 ek chaatr to yahaan 40 kimi se rose cycle chalaakar aata he magar system use rose fail karata hoga
 One teacher told that to deal with this pressure, we have specially designed a routine so that no more than one thousand students are on campus at any given time
 im ahambadabad ke professor ko ramlakhan singh yadav college par ek adhyayan karnaa chahie
 The college is just three kilometers away from the Chief Minister's residence, but one lakh light years away from the government's eyes
 ramlakhan singh yadav bihar ke dabang netaa hue the, inke naam par kai jagahon par college he
 In our country, there was a dispute over the making of a statue of only 200 crores
 iskaa mujhe dukh he
 The demand should have been that if the idol of Ram is being built then it should be built at a cost of 20,000 crores instead of 200
 taaki duniya ko pataa chale ki ham bharat ke naujavaanon ke liye college bhale na bana sake, jo bane hue hai, unhen bhale na bachaa sake, magar murti ham chaah len to banaakar rahenge
 Our youth will not pass by studying in class, they are getting educated by watching debates on these topics in front of the TV channel
 ramlakhan singh yadav college ke principal sahab kii baat sahi he, aakhir ve kya kar sakate hai, jab koi kuch kar hi nahin rahaa he ve kya kar sakate hai
 Our colleagues Harbans and Manoj have sent the hall of a college in Dumka
 ye ek alag uniwarsity he
 Sido Kanhu Murmu University
 is uniwarsity main dumka, devgarh, godda, jamtada, pakudaur sahibganj ke 13 mahavidhyalay aate hai
 In 1855, Sido Kanhu raised his voice against the injustice of English rule and moneylenders
 30 june, 1855 kii raat sahibganj zila ke bhogandil gaanv main 10 hazaar se adhik santhal jamaa hue the
 Sido Murmu and Kanhu Murmu declared independence that night
 inaki zudwaan bahanen chand or bhairav bhi shahid ho gai thim
 This Santhal rebellion before 1857 is a defining page in history
 chaar bhai-bahanon ke shahid hone kaa kissa kaash jamaane tak pahunchataa magar sido or kanhu ke naam par bani uniwarsity kii haalat bhi thik nahin he
 The future of 55 thousand students in this university is waiting to be bright
 is universti main 476 assitant professor hone chahie magar 288 hi hai
 188 posts are vacant
 reader ke 34 pad hone chahie magar ek bhi reader nahin he
 Only one of the 13 colleges here has the privilege of being the principal
 baaki 12 college main principal bhi nahin hai
 Students and students have understood one thing
 uniwarsity kaa matlab pariksha dena or paas kar janaa he
 During this series, students and professors from many places told on the phone that there is only one thing that is going on
 imtahaan kaa farm bharaana or imtahaan karana
 Apart from this, all work is closed
 har college main principal or uniwarsity main visi kaa cameraa or aphis chamakta hua milegaa
 Pottery will definitely be found there
 padhai barbaad kar, paryaavaran kii raksha karte hue
 Teachers know what the reality is, so they are unable to claim it either
 yah baat sahi he
 When there is no one to teach, then what is left will teach the whole
 jharkhand ke do vishvavidhyalayon kaa haal hamane dekha
 Now i feel proud to tell the condition of Vinoba Bhave University in North Chotanagpur
 yahi ki hamaare aaj ke netaaon ne yaad karne ke maamle main kisi bhi netaa ko nahin choda
 On seeing the sign of anyone who has remembered, the soul trembles in the name of remembrance
 ab kuch ho kisi kii smriti main kuch bhi na bane
 There is also a shortage of 70 percent teachers in this university
 maatr 30 pratishat bache hue shikshakon ke bharose yah uniwarsity tal rahi he
 Students complain, the complaint is heard
 hamaare desh main karrwai bhale na ho, sunwaayee ho jaati he
 Now, many people consider the hearing to be action and postpone their sit-in till the next strike
 jo shikshak bache hue hai unhen college ke prashasan kaa kaam bhi karnaa hota he
 Even if the work of education stops, the work of administration should not stop
 bharat kii janata isi yakeen main soti he ki shashan kaa prashasan chal rahaa he
 The rest of the hospitals, schools do not run, what is the difference
 uniwarsity main ab is baat ko lekar ummid jaagi he ki 9 saal baad prophessoron kii bahaali kii kavayad shuru ho rahi he
 No one knows if there will be 70 per cent restoration, but the restoration is going to happen, hearing this, there has been a cloud of expectations
 professor ke aane kaa anumaan mausam vibhaag ke anumaan jaisaa ho gaya hai
 India will be the only country in the world where so many colleges have been opened for not teaching
 is halaat main aapako reating naam ke jhunjhane se dhokhaa diya jaataa he ki bharat main bhi duniya kii tarah reating shuru ho gai he
 Now colleges will be ranked
 is series ke dauraan yah bhi samaj aa rahaa he ki collejon kii grading ke liye neshnal acredation council (nack) kaa system bhi naakaafi or naakaam he
 a teacher from Surat said that when a team of Naik comes to our city, they have to send a sari and a box of sweets
 kai jagahon par nack kii team acha kaam bhi kar jaati he
 But what will happen with the NAC and rating, do you know that there are not 70 percent professors in such and such college
 hazaar se lekar das das hazaar chaatro kaa bhavishya admician fees lekar barbaad kiya ja rahaa he
 But this issue is not necessary
 murti banani chahie
 Heard that politicians have started drinking poison
 bharat ke lakhon-karodon chaatro ne uniwarsity main jaakar jo amrit piya he, usne hamaari vyavasthaaon ke saahas ko amar kar diya he or chaatro ko jarjar
 This line will be understood only when you read it four times and listen five times
 tippaniyan There is a happy news for the teachers of University
 aisa nahin he ki karaab system main khushiyaan nahin aati hai
 Come and will come
 prophessoron ke jivan main saatven vetan ayog kaa aagaman hua he, badhai
 The salary of teachers of Central University, State University and Aided College has increased
 is ghoshnaa se pataa chalaa ki bharat main 7 lakh, 58 hazaar professor hai
 i wish i could also find out how many lakh professors are not there in India
 selary zaruri he, kyonki jo bache hue professor-lekturer hai, padhaane ke liye kaaphi mehnat karte hai, khaskar hamane dilli uniwarsity main to dekha he, hamaare teacher hamen padhaane ke liye ghar par 5-5 ghante rose pard kar aate the
 Then we came to know for the first time that to teach we also have to read
 jo nahin padhaate hai wo principal yaa sattarudh dal kaa zaruri kaam karte hai
 That too is the work of nation building
 chaatr nirmaan se bhi bada kaam he raashtra nirmaan
 It is expected that there will be a press conference on the vacant posts as well
 jisamen bataaya jayega ki bahaali kii prakriya kaise paardarshee hogi
 Those who take the bag of the ruling party, not the readers, will get jobs
 ranchi uniwarsity kaa yah ramlakhan singh yadav college he
 It is a college in the Koker area, 100 katha is built on the ground
 80 ke dashak se hi college kii zamin ko lekar nyaayik vivaad chal rahaa he
 This college is also an example of our judicial process
 40 saal main yah mukadmaa anjaam par nahin pahunchaa he
 Nobody showed activeness even in college
 supreme court ke ste ke kaaran yahaan par nayaa nirmaan nahin ho saktaa he
 It has 9500 students studying from inter to graduation
 chwis besd credit system lagu hone ke baad har vishay main shikshakon kii zarurat bad gai he
 Currently there are no more than one or two lecturers for any subject
 nae system ke hisaab se is college ko 150 ke kareeb shikshak chahie magar puraane system ke hisaab se 38 hi hai
 300 students have taken admission in history but the teacher is the same
 commers main aath sau chaatr hai, magar padhaane ke liye maatr 3 teacher hai
 The condition is that the teacher should take class or test or check the copy
 teen-teen, chaar-chaar maheenaa pariksha hoti he or phir kapi check hoti hai
 The teacher says that we still teach, but you can understand what education will be
 is college main ranchi ke aas-paas ke gramin ilaake se bachche padhane aate hai
 a student comes here cycling daily from 40 km, but the system fails him daily
 ek shikshak ne bataaya ki is dabaav se nipatane ke liye hamane khaas tarah se routine banaaya he taaki kisi vakt ek hazaar se adhik chaatr campus main na ho
 The professor at IIM Ahmadabad should do a study on Ramlakhan Singh Yadav College
 yah college mukhyamantri ke awaas se maatr teen kilometre kii duuri par he magar sarkaar kii nigaah se ek lakh prakaash varsh dur he
 Ramlakhan Singh Yadav was a strong politician of Bihar, there is a college in his name
 hamaare mulk main maatr 200 karod kii murti banane par vivaad ho gaya
 i am sorry for this maang yah honi chahie tha ki ram kii murti ban rahi he to 200 kii jagah 20,000 karod kii laagat se banani chahie
 So that the world knows that we may not be able to build a college for the youth of India, may not save those who have remained, but if we wish, the idol will be built
 hamaare yuva ab class rup main padhakar paas nahin honge, ve tivi channel ke saamne in vishyon par dibet dekhte hue agucated ho rahe hai
 The principal of Ramlakhan Singh Yadav College is right, what can they do when someone is not doing anything, what can they do
 hamaare sahyogi harbans or manoj ne dumka ke ek college kaa haal bheja he
 It is a separate university
 sido kanhu murmu uniwarsity
 The university has 13 colleges in Dumka, Deoghar, Godda, Jamtara, Pakur and Sahebganj
 1855 main sido kanhu ne angrezi hukumat or sahukaaron ke anyaay ke kilaaf awaz buland kii thi
 On the night of 30 June 1855, more than 10 thousand Santhals had gathered in Bhogandil village of Sahebganj district
 sido murmu or kanhu murmu ne us raat azaadi kaa elaan kar diya
 Their twin sisters Chand and Bhairav were also martyred
 1857 se pehle kaa yah santhal vidroh itihaas kaa ek nirnaayak panna he
 The story of the martyrdom of four siblings reaches the times, but the condition of the university named after Sido and Kanhu is also not good
 is uniwarsity main 55 hazaar chaatro kaa bhavishya ujjwal hone kaa intazaar kar rahaa he
 There should be 476 assistant professors in this university but there are only 288
 188 pad rikt hai
 There should be 34 posts of a reader but not a single reader
 yahaan ke 13 mahavidhyalayon main se sirf ek ke paas principal hone kaa saubhaahgya praapt hai
 The remaining 12 colleges do not even have principals
 chaatr or chaatraon ko ek baat samaj aa gai he
 University means taking and passing the exam
 is series ke dauraan kai jagahon ke chaatro or profasaron ne phone par bataaya ki ek hi kaam he jo chal rahaa he
 To fill the examination form and get the examination done
 iske alaava sab kaam band hai
 In every college, the principal and the vc's room and office in the university will be found shining
 vahaan gamale zarur milenge
 Protecting the environment, ruining studies
 shikshak jaanate hai ki hakeekat kya he, isliye daawa bhi nahin kar pate hai
 This is true
 jab padhaane vaala hoga hi nahin to jo bachaa hua he wo kaise sara padhaa degaa
 We have seen the condition of two universities of Jharkhand
 ab uttari chotanagpur ke vinoba bhaave uniwarsity kaa haal bataate hue garv sa mahasoos ho rahaa he
 That our today's leaders have not left any leaders in the matter of remembrance
 jise bhi yaad kiya he unki nishaani dekhakar yaad ke naam se hi ruh kaanp uthati he
 Now, nothing should be made in anyone's memory
 is uniwarsity main bhi 70 pratishat shikshakon kii kami bataai ja rahi he
 This university is postponed due to the remaining 30 percent teachers
 chaatr shikaayat karte hai, shikaayat sun lee jaati he
 Even if there is no action in our country, a hearing takes place
 ab to bahut se log sunwaayee ko hi karrwai samaj kar apana dharna agle dharne tak ke liye sthagit kar dete hai
 The teachers who remain are also required to do the administration of the college
 padhai kaa kaam bhale hi ruk jaae, prashasan kaa kaam nahin ruknaa chahie
 The people of India sleep in the belief that governance is going on
 baaki aspataal, skool chale na chale, kya fark padataa he
 There is hope in the university that after 9 years, the exercise of reinstatement of professors is starting
 kisi ko pataa nahin ki kya 70 fisadi bahaali hogi, magar bahaali hone ja rahi he yahi sunakar ummiido ke badal chaa gaye hai
 The estimate of the professor's arrival has become like the estimate of the Meteorological Department
 bharat duniya kaa akelaa desh hoga jahaan nahin padhaane ke liye itane college khole gaye hai
 In this situation you are deceived by the annoyance of the name of rating that the rating has started in India like the world
 ab collejon kii ranking hogi
 During this series, it is also understood that the National Accreditation Council (NAC) system for grading colleges is also insufficient and unsuccessful
 surat kii ek shikshika ne kaha ki hamaare shahar main nack kii team aati he to unhen sari or mithai kaa dibba dekar bhejnaa hota he

 Our colleagues Harbans and Manoj have sent the hall of a college in Dumka
 ye ek alag uniwarsity he
 Sido Kanhu Murmu University
 is uniwarsity main dumka, devgarh, godda, jamtada, pakudaur sahibganj ke 13 mahavidhyalay aate hai
 In 1855, Sido Kanhu raised his voice against the injustice of English rule and moneylenders
 30 june, 1855 kii raat sahibganj zila ke bhogandil gaanv main 10 hazaar se adhik santhal jamaa hue the
 Sido Murmu and Kanhu Murmu declared independence that night
 inaki zudwaan bahanen chand or bhairav bhi shahid ho gai thim
 This Santhal rebellion before 1857 is a defining page in history
 chaar bhai-bahanon ke shahid hone kaa kissa kaash jamaane tak pahunchataa magar sido or kanhu ke naam par bani uniwarsity kii haalat bhi thik nahin he
 The future of 55 thousand students in this university is waiting to be bright
 is universti main 476 assitant professor hone chahie magar 288 hi hai
 188 posts are vacant
 reader ke 34 pad hone chahie magar ek bhi reader nahin he
 Only one of the 13 colleges here has the privilege of being the principal
 baaki 12 college main principal bhi nahin hai
 Students and students have understood one thing
 uniwarsity kaa matlab pariksha dena or paas kar janaa he
 During this series, students and professors from many places told on the phone that there is only one thing that is going on
 imtahaan kaa farm bharaana or imtahaan karana
 Apart from this, all work is closed
 har college main principal or uniwarsity main visi kaa cameraa or aphis chamakta hua milegaa
 Pottery will definitely be found there
 padhai barbaad kar, paryaavaran kii raksha karte hue
 Teachers know what the reality is, so they are unable to claim it either
 yah baat sahi he
 When there is no one to teach, then what is left will teach the whole
 jharkhand ke do vishvavidhyalayon kaa haal hamane dekha
 Now i feel proud to tell the condition of Vinoba Bhave University in North Chotanagpur
 yahi ki hamaare aaj ke netaaon ne yaad karne ke maamle main kisi bhi netaa ko nahin choda
 On seeing the sign of anyone who has remembered, the soul trembles in the name of remembrance
 ab kuch ho kisi kii smriti main kuch bhi na bane
 There is also a shortage of 70 percent teachers in this university
 maatr 30 pratishat bache hue shikshakon ke bharose yah uniwarsity tal rahi he
 Students complain, the complaint is heard
 hamaare desh main karrwai bhale na ho, sunwaayee ho jaati he
 Now, many people consider the hearing to be action and postpone their sit-in till the next strike
 jo shikshak bache hue hai unhen college ke prashasan kaa kaam bhi karnaa hota he
 Even if the work of education stops, the work of administration should not stop
 bharat kii janata isi yakeen main soti he ki shashan kaa prashasan chal rahaa he
 The rest of the hospitals, schools do not run, what is the difference
 uniwarsity main ab is baat ko lekar ummid jaagi he ki 9 saal baad prophessoron kii bahaali kii kavayad shuru ho rahi he
 No one knows if there will be 70 per cent restoration, but the restoration is going to happen, hearing this, there has been a cloud of expectations
 professor ke aane kaa anumaan mausam vibhaag ke anumaan jaisaa ho gaya hai
 India will be the only country in the world where so many colleges have been opened for not teaching
 is halaat main aapako reating naam ke jhunjhane se dhokhaa diya jaataa he ki bharat main bhi duniya kii tarah reating shuru ho gai he
 Now colleges will be ranked
 is series ke dauraan yah bhi samaj aa rahaa he ki collejon kii grading ke liye neshnal acredation council (nack) kaa system bhi naakaafi or naakaam he
 a teacher from Surat said that when a team of Naik comes to our city, they have to send a sari and a box of sweets
 kai jagahon par nack kii team acha kaam bhi kar jaati he
 But what will happen with the NAC and rating, do you know that there are not 70 percent professors in such and such college
 hazaar se lekar das das hazaar chaatro kaa bhavishya admician fees lekar barbaad kiya ja rahaa he
 But this issue is not necessary
 murti banani chahie
 Heard that politicians have started drinking poison
 bharat ke lakhon-karodon chaatro ne uniwarsity main jaakar jo amrit piya he, usne hamaari vyavasthaaon ke saahas ko amar kar diya he or chaatro ko jarjar
 This line will be understood only when you read it four times and listen five times
 tippaniyan There is a happy news for the teachers of University
 aisa nahin he ki karaab system main khushiyaan nahin aati hai
 Come and will come
 prophessoron ke jivan main saatven vetan ayog kaa aagaman hua he, badhai
 The salary of teachers of Central University, State University and Aided College has increased
 is ghoshnaa se pataa chalaa ki bharat main 7 lakh, 58 hazaar professor hai
 i wish i could also find out how many lakh professors are not there in India
 selary zaruri he, kyonki jo bache hue professor-lekturer hai, padhaane ke liye kaaphi mehnat karte hai, khaskar hamane dilli uniwarsity main to dekha he, hamaare teacher hamen padhaane ke liye ghar par 5-5 ghante rose pard kar aate the
 Then we came to know for the first time that to teach we also have to read
 jo nahin padhaate hai wo principal yaa sattarudh dal kaa zaruri kaam karte hai
 That too is the work of nation building
 chaatr nirmaan se bhi bada kaam he raashtra nirmaan
 It is expected that there will be a press conference on the vacant posts as well
 jisamen bataaya jayega ki bahaali kii prakriya kaise paardarshee hogi
 Those who take the bag of the ruling party, not the readers, will get jobs
 1855 main sido kanhu ne angrezi hukumat or sahukaaron ke anyaay ke kilaaf awaz buland kii thi
 On the night of 30 June 1855, more than 10 thousand Santhals had gathered in Bhogandil village of Sahebganj district
 sido murmu or kanhu murmu ne us raat azaadi kaa elaan kar diya
 Their twin sisters Chand and Bhairav were also martyred
 1857 se pehle kaa yah santhal vidroh itihaas kaa ek nirnaayak panna he
 The story of the martyrdom of four siblings reaches the times, but the condition of the university named after Sido and Kanhu is also not good
 is uniwarsity main 55 hazaar chaatro kaa bhavishya ujjwal hone kaa intazaar kar rahaa he
 There should be 476 assistant professors in this university but there are only 288
 188 pad rikt hai
 There should be 34 posts of a reader but not a single reader
 yahaan ke 13 mahavidhyalayon main se sirf ek ke paas principal hone kaa saubhaahgya praapt hai
 The remaining 12 colleges do not even have principals
 chaatr or chaatraon ko ek baat samaj aa gai he
 University means taking and passing the exam
 is series ke dauraan kai jagahon ke chaatro or profasaron ne phone par bataaya ki ek hi kaam he jo chal rahaa he
 To fill the examination form and get the examination done
 iske alaava sab kaam band hai
 In every college, the principal and the vc's room and office in the university will be found shining
 vahaan gamale zarur milenge
 Protecting the environment, ruining studies
 shikshak jaanate hai ki hakeekat kya he, isliye daawa bhi nahin kar pate hai
 This is true
 jab padhaane vaala hoga hi nahin to jo bachaa hua he wo kaise sara padhaa degaa

 This announcement showed that there are 7 lakh, 58 thousand professors in India
 kaash yah bhi pataa chal jaataa ki bharat main kitne lakh professor nahin hai
 Salary is important, because the remaining professors and lecturers work hard to teach, especially as we have seen at Delhi University, our teachers used to study at home for 5-5 hours everyday to teach us
 tab hamen pehali baar pataa chalaa tha ki padhaane ke liye padhanaa bhi padataa he
 Those who do not teach do the essential work of the principal or the ruling party
 wo bhi raashtra nirmaan kaa hi kaam he
 Nation building is a bigger task than student building
 ummid he khaali padon par bhi ek press conference hogi
 Which will explain how the restoration process will be transparent

 That too is the work of nation building
 chaatr nirmaan se bhi bada kaam he raashtra nirmaan
 It is expected that there will be a press conference on the vacant posts as well
 jisamen bataaya jayega ki bahaali kii prakriya kaise paardarshee hogi
 Those who take the bag of the ruling party, not the readers, will get jobs

 loksabhaa main somvaar ko jiesti samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak pesh kiya jayega or congress ne ise dhyaan main rakhte hue apane sabhi saansadon ko sadan main maujuud rahane ke liye vip jari kiya he
 Congress leader and Jyotiraditya Scindia, the chief whip of the party in the Lok Sabha, confirmed this

 On Wednesday, the 122nd Constitution Amendment Bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha
 isamen desh main ek kar pranali ke rup main jiesti lagu karne ke liye samvidhan main sanshodhan kiya ja rahaa he
 Scindia said, 'we have issued a whip to ensure the presence of all the members of the Congress Party in the House
 ’ unhone kaha ki jiesti kaa vichaar sabase pehle congress ne hi diya tha
 Scindia said, 'our former Finance Minister p Chidambaram in his budget speech talked about the concept of Ekkar system across the country
 uske baad 2011 ke bajet satr main sarkaar ne jiesti par samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak pesh kiya, lekin bhaajapa chaar saal tak aam-sahmati nahin bana saki
 As a result, the bill became ineffective
 ’endie kii vajah se rajyasabha main atka hua tha bill: sindhiyasindhiya ne kaha, ‘baad main rajg sarkaar ne maamle ko uthaaya or pichley saal ise loksabhaa main paarit karaayaa, jahaan use bahumat praapt he
 The NDA government did not believe in the spirit of democracy, that is, dialogue and consensus, so it was long overdue
 jab unhen laga ki iske liye samvaad anivaary he to unhone iskaa masauda dobaaraa taiyaar kiya or ise rajyasabha main laae jahaan ise manjuuri mil gai
 'GST benefits the country' Scindia, a Lok Sabha member from Madhya Pradesh's Guna, said, 'we want the country to benefit from GST

 We would like to pass it but ensure that its benefits reach the public and the country
 ’ congress ne pehle maang kii thi ki jiesti main byaaj dar kii seemaa 18 pratishat tay kii jaae

 Overall, it was found that both conventional and organic apples had the same number of bacteria
 beg ne bataaya, "prayek seb ke ghatakon ko ausat rup se ek saath rakhane par, hamane anumaan lagaaya ki 240 gram seb main kareeb 10 karod bacteria hai
 "most of the bacteria were found in seeds and most of the rest were in the flash
 isliye agar aap beej kosh ko hataa den to aapke khaane main bacteria kii sankhya main 1 karod tak kii kami aa jaaegi
 Chandrayaan 2: The journey of Chandrayaan-2 remains incomplete without these two 'rocket women', know who are Vanita Muthayya and Ritu Karidhal Now the question is whether these bacteria are good or beneficial for you? Baig explained, "fresh And biologically managed apples have significantly more diversity, parity, and a community of specific bacteria than conventionally managed apples
 "bacteria kaa vishisht samooh jo swasthya par sambhavit rup se asar daalane ke liye jane jate hai, kaa bhi moolyankan jaivik seb ke paksh main kiya gaya
 Researchers say the group 'ischerichia-shingella', a group of bacteria known to cause the disease, was found in samples of traditional apples but did not have a presence in organic apples

 nirbhaya cese main doshi akshay kii yachika khaarijcourt ne bachaav paksh kii daleel ko apraasangik batayapatiala house court main 7 janvari tak sunwaayee talinirbhaya gangrape ke gunaahagaar akshay thakur kii punarvichaar yachika ko supreme court ne khaarij kar diya he
 The Supreme Court said that the investigation and trial in the Nirbhaya case was absolutely correct
 doshiyon ne is par sawaal uthaae the
 During the hearing in this case, Akshay's lawyer had cited the alleged revelations of Nirbhaya's friend
 court ne ise apraasangik bataaya
 After Akshay's review petition was dismissed in the Supreme Court and the decision on hanging in Patiala House Court till January 7, what options are left now
 jaaniye nirbhaya ke gunahagaar ab faansee se bachane ke liye kya kanoonee vikalp apana sakate hai
 The Tihar Jail administration has again served a final notice to the convicts of the Nirbhaya incident on Wednesday night
 notice main kaha gaya he ki vah agar chahen to apni maut kii sajaa se bachane ke liye ek saptaah ke andar raashtrapati ke yahaan maafee kii darkhwaast de sakate hai
 The offenders to whom these notices were served by Tihar Jail are Mukesh, Akshay Kumar Singh, Pawan Kumar Gupta and Vinay
 nirbhaya cese ke doshi pawan gupta ko chand din pehle hi mondoli jail se tihaad jail main laakar kaid kiya gaya he, jabaki akshay kumaar singh, mukesh or vinay pehle se hi tihaad kii alag-alag jelon main band hai
 Advocate AP Singh pleaded strangely in the court about not giving capital punishment to the chance to file curative petition
 unhone kaha ki veda puraana ke mutabik kaliyug main logon kii umr kam ho gai he to phir faansee kyon?akshay ke vakil ne kaha kiek hafte main curative pitishan karenge
 If this too is dismissed, mercy petition will be filed
 akshay ke vakil ne kaha ki pehle curitev daakhil karenge or phir dayaa yachika
 Now the culprits have the option of curative petition
 rivyuu ke liye 1 hafte or raashtrapati ke paas dayaa yachika daakhil karne ke liye ek hafte kaa diya gaya he
 The mercy petition can be hanged only after being dismissed
 nirbhaya ke dost ke kathith khulaase kaa bachaav paksh court main istemaal kar saktaa he
 The defense will try to hang the case once again
 bachaav paksh san 2017 ke baad un sabhi maamalon kii list court main pesh karegaa jinamein faansee kii sajaa ko umr kaid main tabdeel kii gai he
 Similarly, the defense in this case can also demand punishment of life imprisonment to the convicts
 tihaad jail prashasan ne doshiyon ko diya 7 din kaa vaktsupreme court ke faisle ke baad patiala house court main sunwaayee 7 janvari tak tal gai he
 The family members of Nirbhaya demanded that a death warrant be issued immediately but the court said that the culprits should get full opportunity to try the legal option
 ab tihaad jail prashasan ne saat din ke bheetar chaaron doshiyon ko notice dekar poocha ki wo aage kya kanoonee kadam uthaanaa chaahate hai
 There will be a hearing on 7 January
 lekin is dauraan agar dayaa yachika pending rahi to saat janvari ko bhi deth warrant jari nahin ho paaegaa
 The death warrant will be issued only after the mercy petition is settled
 kab jari hoga deth warrant?ab sawaal ye he ki bachaav paksh pehle dayaa yachika daakhil karegaa yaa curative pitishan
 The defense says that it will file both the petitions
 pehle curative pitishan or uske baad dayaa yachika daakhil kii jaaegi
 Death warrants will be issued only after all petitions are dismissed
 nirbhaya ke parijan phir hue dukhiis maamle main phir se nai taarikh milane ke baad nirbhaya ke parijan kaaphi naaraaz or dukhi najar aae
 The next hearing in Patiala House Court will now be on 7 January 2020
 aise main doshiyon ko ab 20 din ko mohalat or mil gai he
 What happened in the Supreme Court hearing? On Wednesday, in the Supreme Court, the reconsideration of Akshay, who was convicted in the Nirbhaya case, was debated in the Supreme Court
 adaalat ne donon pakshon ko tees minute kaa samay diya tha
 Both had to say the whole thing in an hour
 bahes kii shuruyaat akshay ke vakil api singh ne kii
 He said that there were many flaws in the evidence and investigation in the case
 is par jaj bopanna nen kaha ki ye vakt nahin he
 This matter should have been raised earlier
 jawaab main satta paksh ke vakil api singh ne kaha ki wo maamle main nae tathy rakh rahe hai
 He said that there is media pressure in the case
 janata bhi lagaataar dabaav bana rahi he
 These things should also be taken care of while hanging my client
 kahin aisa naa ho ki dabaav main galat faisla ho jaae
 He said that a case in the case is going on in Patiala House Court against Nirbhaya's friend
 uske khilaaf 20 disambar ko sunwaayee bhi honi he
 On this, the Supreme Court asked what he had to do with this matter
 doshi kisi bhi sahanubhuti ke hakdaar nahimbahas kaa jawaab dete hue sarkari vakil tushaar mehta ne kaha ki maamle main punarvichaar yachika tatkaal khaarij hona chahie
 The review petition of the remaining convicts on this case has been dismissed
 aise main is par alag se sochna vakt kii barbaadi he
 Tushar Mehta said that the guilty are not entitled to any kind of sympathy and be given capital punishment
 wo kanoonee daanvpech khelkar maamle ko lataka rahe hai

 In this case, he clarified that the responsibility of maintaining law and order in the state is not the Assam Rifles, but the local police

 There is no dearth of people in Delhi who, for different reasons, take away their right to live by others, that is, kill them
 police krime control ke chaahe lakh daawey kare, khud police ke aankade bataate hai ki dilli menkatl ke maamlekam hone kaa naam hi nahin le rahe
 In the last two years, where the murder cases are touching the figure of 500, the cases of attempted murder are beyond six hundred and this is a proof of the dreadful mood of Delhi
 lekin isse bhi zyaada chaunkaanewaala tathy ye he ki dilli main sabase zyaada yani kareeb 18 fisadi qatl dushmani kii vajah se hote hai
 Delhi's mood is becoming increasingly dangerous
 dilli main har saal qareeb 5 sau qatl hote hai
 Most killings are carried out due to enmity
 har saal qatl kii koshish ke maamle 6 sau ke paar ho chuke hai
 Rohini area is at the forefront of murder cases
 dilli police ke aankade bataate hai ki dilli main sabase zyaada 46 fisadi qatl dushmani ke chalate hote hai
 The second number is the crime of passion with 18 percent of the murder
 thik isi tarah duusare jurm jaise lutpaat, dakaiti kii vajah se honevaale qatl 10 fisadi hai, jabaki rishton ke pench main ulajh kar 10 fisadi qatl hote hai
 Apart from this, about 15% of the killings are due to different reasons
 saal 2016 kii tarah pichley saal yani 2017 main bhi qatl or qatl kii koshish ke vaakyon se dilli saal par sahami rahi
 It is another matter that these sentences have decreased in the mirror of data, but this decrease is so slight that it is scared to see these incidents
 dilli police ke taaze aankadon ke mutabik saal 2017 main qatl ke kul 501 maamle darj hue the
 While 462 murder cases were registered last year
 isi tarah 2017 main jahaan qatl kii koshish ke 614 maamle the
 At the same time last year, only a low of 613 cases were reported
 dilli main dakaiti ke maamalon main bhi maamuli kami ai he
 These cases were 36 in 2017 as compared to 45 in 2016
 jabaki apharan yani kidnaping ke maamle bhi 5 hazaar ke paar rahe
 In 2017 there were 5 thousand 657 kidnapping whereas in 2017 5 thousand 355
 saal 2017 kii sabase badi murder mistry yani zindal oil mills murder cese sulajh kar bhi ansulajhaa rahaa
 In this, the murderers killed five women from a family in North East Delhi in the dark of night
 police ne is maamle ko sulajhaate hue ghar ke guard or uske rishtedaaron ko qaatil bataaya
 It is another matter that till now the police have a lack of concrete evidence against these accused
 jo julri baraamad hui he, use mulzimon ke gharavaalon ne apana bataaya he, jabaki finger print tak mail nahin kha rahe hai
 On the other hand, the districts like Rohini and Outer District kept on shaking with the incidents of murder throughout the year
 rohinee or outer main pichley saal lagaataar 67 or 63 qatl ke maamle darj hue, jo bahut zyaada hai
 Among them, there were 18 murder cases in Rohini alone, which the police have not found any clue

 Sachin Tendulkar has admitted for the first time that the 1999–2000 match-fixing episode had an impact on his performance and the Indian team had to go through a difficult and painful phase as the 'spectators looked at him with suspicion
 tendulkar ne kaha ki bharat ke 1999-2000 ke austrailia daure par unki manodasha sahi nahin thi
 Sachin said in an interview that no one ever contacted me nor did we talk about it in team meetings
 unhone kaha ki mujhe yaad he ki 1999-2000 main austrailia daure par hamaara khelnaa mushkil ho gaya tha
 Before the series such things started happening and as a cricketer no one wants to hear this
 tendulkar ne kaha ki aap chaahate hai ki khel paak saaf rahe
 i wanted people not to look at us with suspicion and enjoy the game
 iske liye khilaadiyon kii manodasha sahi honi jaruri thi jo us samay nahin thi
 He said that people used to taunt us in the match
 mujhe or puri team ko bahut apmaan mahasoos hota tha
 Tendulkar believes that beating Australia 2–1 on their soil was a turning point
 unhone kaha ki mujhe yakeen tha ki austrailia ke khilaaf hamaare behtareen pradarshan se cricketpremi ateet kii baton ko bhul jaayenge or khel kaa majaa lene lagenge
 By the grace of God we could do this
 tendulkar ne kaha ki ham mumbai main pehla match haar gaye lekin kolkata main doosraa match vikat paristhitiyon main jitkar shrinkhalaa main barabari kii
 We won the series by winning the last match
 isse cricket premi us bure adhyay ko bhuulane ko majaboor ho gaye
 Recalling the horrific phase of match-fixing, Biker said that the South African board had been approached by bookies
 unhone kaha ki satorio ne hamase sidhe sampark karke team baithkon main khilaadiyon se unki peshkash sweekaar karne ko kaha tha
 In some ICC meetings i raised this issue but i was asked for witnesses and evidence
 is par baatcheet nahin hui
 Centuries ago, a nobleman called the stomach a sinner
 aaj tak pet aisa villen bana baitha he ki use bharne kii har jugat paap kii shrenee main aa jaati he
 Even though the stomach is only one organ, where the food reaches the food through the tongue and squeezes the necessary chemical to the rest of the body and sends it to the stomach
 kehane kaa taatpary yah ki hamaari duniya main kisi bhi chiz ko lekar ek soch ban jaati he or phir us label ko hataa paanaa naammumkin sa ho jaataa he
 One such label is on the market's forehead
 media or bazaar ke najuk rishte ko samajhane se pehle chand sach ko sweekaar karke chalanaa hoga
 Media is the fourth pillar of society as well as a business
 media skulon se nikalne vaale chaatr samaaj sudhaar ke saath-saath roti bhi kamanaa chaahate hai
 Media expansion has become possible only during the era of marketism
 media ke vistaar se media kii azaadi badi he
 But with this, that thin line, which makes the difference between the media market and the market, where the news is written from the mood of the market, where the tone of the sponsor's money, the voice threatens
 is
 to kya bazaarwaad ke daur kaa media apni vishwasaneeyata kho rahaa he
 Or is it really marketism that has dominated the media
 kya myne hai bazaarwaad ke or kaise is daur main rahete hue media apni swatantraaa keval raajnneetik vichaardhaara se nahin, balki bazaar se bhi banaaye rakhe
 The answers to these questions are theoretical, making them practical is the biggest challenge of the media of the current era
 media ek aisa thanedaar he, jisaki khabar lene vaala koi nahin tha
 In recent times, the media has become the police to catch a thief
 media hi sajaa sunaane vaali adaalat
 The media, teaching the lesson of fairness, began to declare unilateral decisions
 ab yah sarvashaktishaalee hone kaa ahsaas he yaa phir bazaar ke kuch aise sameekaran, jahaan aisa karnaa majaburi ban chukaa he
 But even today people sitting in the far corners of the country expect justice from the media
 jo police prashasan ke sataaye, rajanetaaon ke thage hai, ve media kii ore hi takate hai
 It is the ultimate responsibility of the media to live up to those expectations and even in the midst of all the criticism of the media, if the people live up to that expectation, it is a huge achievement of the media in the era of marketism
 aaj media ko bazaarwaad ke kathghare main khadaa kiya jaataa he, to yah behad durbhagyapurna he, lekin saath -saath yah utana hi zaruri bhi he
 Since change is a law of nature, then positive change is the need of the hour
 media ke sandarbh main kya he bazaarvartharahavin sadi kii shuruyaat main akhbaar main pehali baar paise dekar ek vigyaapan chapa tha
 This was the beginning of a revolutionary era, where the expense of printing slowly was going to end
 patrkaar ab keval apane uddeshy kii chintaa kar sakate the, jan-jan tak pahunchane kaa jariya mil chukaa tha
 In the coming decades, as the shape of media changed, advertisements changed as well
 bazaar kaa vistaar hua
 Marketism was born
 bazaarwaad kii dastak pehle hamaari bhaawanaaon par hui, yaa phir hamaare siddhanton par, yah bahes kaa vishay he, kyonki bachche ko vakt nahin de paane kii surat main maa-baap use ek keemtee khilonaa dekar bhaawanaaon kii bharpai karne lage
 Shayari was replaced by Smiley
 gairzaruri chizon se almariyaan patane lageen
 The society changed and the media showing the mirror to the changing society also changed
 agar paribhaasha ke hisaab se chalem, to yahaan jis news media kii charchaa ham kar rahe hai, vahaan khabaron ke chayan main bazaar haaavee hone ke aarope lage 
 This is just a feeling or reality, we will discuss it further
 pehle news media or bazaarwaad ke rishte ko samajhate hai, khaskar television news
 TRP is a term used indiscriminately, but it is very cryptic
 vyavsaay kii baarikiyon main na jate hue aasaan shabdon main samajhen to kisi channel ko kitne log dekh rahe hai, yah tiarapy se pataa chalata he
 The TRP of any show decides whether it is successful or not
 jaise kabhi ection filmon kaa daur aata he or kabhi romentic filmon kaa
 In the same way, sometimes people watch more shows of strange news, sometimes hard political debates
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki har tivi news channel tiarapy ko mahatva detaa he, kyonki edwartigers channel kii saakh ko inhen ankon se maapte hai
 So if we want revenue, then it is necessary to increase TRP and if TRP is to be increased, then it has to be shown that what people want to see, that is, from a perspective, then the image of marketism started to show
 media ke kartavya kahin nirdhaarit nahin the, par apeksha hameshaa hi rahi he ki khabaren ve dikhaai jaaen, jinase logon kaa sarokaar ho, jisase logon kaa bhala ho
 For example, is it good for Kangana Ranot and Hrithik Roshan to fight the crossroads, is it not known to the big bosses of media channels and newspapers who have been doing journalism for almost four decades? Should anyone be concerned with the fight? Obviously, despite being a student, you will know the answers to these questions, but it is also important to understand its practical aspect
 sawaal yah he ki aisa kyon hota he? agar na isse kisi kaa lenaa-dena he, na kisi kaa koi phayda he, to is khabar ko koun dekhtaa he? sawaal yahaan aakar pechida ho jaataa he, kyonki is khabar ko log dekhte hai or badi sankhya main dekhte hai
 In an interview to Live Mint in 2008, Uday Shankar, the then head of Star India, said in response to a question on the declining level of journalism, "we need to distinguish between two things
" pehla yah ki kya aisi khabaren jaan-boojhkar dikhaayi ja rahi hai yaa phir kaabiliat kii kami or agyanta kii vajah se kiya ja rahaa he
 i think both these challenges exist in the Indian news media
 keval tivi nahin, balki print main bhi
 "this was the period when the strange news was dominated on the TV screen
 saaf he us daur main log aisi khabaren dekh rahe the, yani in khabaron kaa bazaar tha
 Now it is necessary to reiterate here once again that nothing is bad with the mention of the word market
 media samaaj kaa aainaa he to bazaar bhi pratibimb he
 In such a situation, mentioning a personal experience here is necessary to throw light on this matter
 bharat ke swatantraaa senaniyon par tivi ke liye koi vistrut siries nahin bani thi
 The stories of Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad were all heard, but the story of fighters like Baadar Jatin, Prafulla Chaki was almost unheard of
 lihaaja vandemataram naam ke sho ke tahat ajtak channel par swatantraaa senaniyon ke kisse sunaaye gayi
 The show received a good response from critics, but did not receive a TRP
 paanch sho ke baad us siries ko band karnaa padaa
 On the other hand, in the show named 'aaj Tak Aaj', different village problems, achievements were told, but TRP would have been there when there were reports of leopard, bear entering the village or there were reports of beatings
 to iskaa kya matlab nikaalen, logon ko shaheedon yaa sadak, bijli kii khabaron se koi sarokaar nahin, isse kisi kaa koi phayda nahin? kyonki koshish to kii gai ki ‘acchhee’ khabaren dikhaayi jaaen, par in ‘acchhee’ khabaron ko dekhne vaale kam the
 It is a simple matter, there was no market for those reports
 inamen logon kii ruchi nahin thi
 As a student, the question will arise in your mind that even then we should do what is right according to the set standards
 iskaa jawaab yah he ki jab aapaki baat koi sunegaa hi nahin, to sandesh kitna bhi sahi ho, apana makasad puraa hi nahin kar saktaa
 That is why it should be shown as the market, but the message should not be tampered with at all
 bazaar khabaron kaa rukh bhale hi tay kare, khabaron kaa swaroop kabhi na tay kare
 Then there will be a period of marketism, but marketism will never dominate the media
 baazaaroo banaam bazariagar aap soshal media kaa istemaal karte hai to patrakarita ke chaatr hone ke naate do shabd aapako behad pareshaan karte honge
 The first is paid media
 doosraa he prestitute
 These words are used for every media person or organization that is accused of sponsoring an ideology
 yah duusari baat he ki aarope khud kitne sahi yaa galat hote hai, yah sandeh ke ghere main rahata he
 The pain of breaking his charges was once the then Minister of State for External Affairs, General (retd
) V
 ke
 Singh had retracted the Prestitute on the media
 tab se hindustan main yah shabd behad prachlit ho gaya, par yah shabd unka avishkaar nahin
 Gerald Selant, the publisher of the US magazine Trends Journal, first used the term prostitute
 urban dictionari ke mutabik ‘freelans patrkaar or mukhyadhara se alag media main kaam karne vaale patrkaar, amuman prestitute shabd kaa istemaal un logon ke liye karte hai, jo sarkaar yaa sansthaaon ke paksh main aankh moond kar khabaren dete hai or patrkaar hone ke naate nishpaksh rahane kii zimmedaari nahin nibhaate
 But in India, the term is also extended to those who run the news against the government, and gradually the term is being used for every journalist or organization that runs news against anyone
 yah kahana galat nahin hoga ki aaj ke daur main kamobesh har patrkaar kisi na kisi kheme kii nazar main baazaaroo he
 Now also understand paid media
 ped media jis sandarbh main prayog kiya jaataa he, vah anupyukt he, kyonki iskaa shabdic arth he edwartiging ke jariye prachaar, par bharat main iskaa istemaal yah kehane ke liye kiya jaataa he ki amuk patrkaar yaa sanghathan ne paise lekar khabar chalaayi
 It should also be understood here that this is not a matter of advertorial, but an allegation of corruption in journalism
 yani kul milakar yah janata kii media ke us rup par jhallahat he, jahaan use yah prathit hota he ki media apane siddhanton ko chhodkar baazaaroo ho gaya he, par bazaarwaad ke yug main media par vimarsh ke dauraan hamen yah samajhnaa hoga ki bhrashtachar or bazaarwaad ek baat nahin hai
 That is why there is a difference between market and market
 baazaaroo vah he, jo bikaoo he, jiskaa patrakarita ke mulyon se, siddhanton se koi lenaa-dena nahin, jo media ko keval vyavsaay samajhataa he
 For example, running news in favor of a particular party by taking money at the time of elections, or ignoring the shortcomings of the party which is in government, so as to be protected
 bade corporate gharaanon se aid milane ke laalach main unki trutiyon par pardaa daalana
 The market, on the other hand, is one that is full of market understanding
 jo janata kii nabj ko samajhataa he or janata ke lokapriy hokar bazaar kaa chaheta banataa he
 For this, he does not show sponsored news, but shows the news of people's concern in an interesting way that people cannot ignore him
 in donon shabdon main keval ek maatra kaa fark he, lekin jaraa-si her-pher se jameen-aasmaan kaa fark aa jaataa he
 Here, not the entire media, but according to different channels and newspapers have to be seen, because in this round of competition, the market that is unable to be done takes the shortcut to be marketable
 yah is kshetra kii badi duvidha rahi he ki kya kisi party kii vichaardhaara se jude hone kaa bhram kisi channel yaa akhbaar ko baazaaroo banaata he ? kyonki hindustan main bhale hi polytical lining, yani channel / akhbaar ke raajnneetik jhukaav ko lekar tasviir spasht nahin hoti, par america main is babat ek dilachasp survey kiya gaya
 a study by the PEW Research Center tried to find out which TV / media people view different opinions
 report ke mutabik adhiktar conservative vichaardhaara vaale fox news dekhte hai or librals mili-jule media par nirbhar hai
 Among them, the New York Times is the top, so should we consider it the bias of these media or the confusion of the viewers
 keval bharat main hi media ko lekar ek nayi chatapataahat nahin dekhi ja rahi, balki bazaarwaad se hamase pehle do-chaar ho chuke america main yah charchaa dashakon se jari he
 Jonathan M
 in 'why Americans Hate the Media and How It Matters'
 laad likhte hai, ‘‘ek nishpaksh, taqatvar or vyapak taur par sammanit news media ab itihaas kii baat he
 There was a period between 1950 and 1979, when institutional journalists were powerful defenders of the republic, who held the highest standard in political dialogue
 ’’haalanki laad aage likhte hai, ‘‘adhikansh maamalon main kisi ek media ko dushprachaar kii vajah se pakshpaat kaa daag jhelana padataa he
 Reality is different from this
 ’’kisi media house ke baazaaroo na hone kaa daayitv uske har ek patrkaar par bhi hota he
 It is personally the responsibility of every journalist to keep the values and principles for which journalism is known
 yah bhi yaad rakhana zaruri he ki koi bhi channel yaa news media jab apane str ko itnaa giraata he ki samaaj main adhiktar log use baazaaroo maanane lagate hai, to uskaa bazaar khud-ba-khud khatm ho jaataa he
 Why this discussion is needed? In English it is said, 'don't shoot the messenger' means do not kill the person who brings the message
 kya maujuuda bahes sandesavahak se aisi naaraazgi he ki use badnaam kiya ja rahaa he yaa phir vaaki patrakarita ke mulya itnaa gir gayi hai ki is vimarsh kii zarurat aan padi he
 Actually the era is of marketism, so the need here is to show day and night and in this world of 24 x 7 there is pressure to show something different every single minute
 kai dfa jab raajnneetik ghatnakram shunya bate sannata hote hai, jab kuch itnaa bada nahin ho rahaa hota, jisamen logon kii dilchaspee hogi, tab amuman khabaron kii talash chand aise namoonay lekar aati he, jo log dekhte to hai, par shikaayat bhi khub hoti he
 For example, for a girl named Gudiya to sit in the studio in the panchayat and decide in the studio itself, with which man should she live
 tiarapy chappar faad, par patrakarita ke siddhanton ko lekar matbhed ho sakate hai
 Similarly, the little Prince's live rescue operation for several consecutive days fell in the pit
 badi khabar na hone kii majaburi kai dfa news sens ko bhi gadde main gira detii he, par bazaar kaa takaza he, varna choubees ghante kya chale ?ye aisi khabaren thim, jo agar vaaki logon ko pasand nahin aatin, to tivi band karne kaa vikalp maujuud tha, par kisi ne aisa kiya nahin
 "the ideology usually seen in newspaper articles depends on what people want to read," wrote Chicago Booth professor Jesse M
 Shapiro in a 2010 research paper
 yah akhbaar maalikon kii nijee raay nahin hoti he
 "for private media, success depends on viewer ratings, not whether the audience feels the program is good or enough
" bazaar keval us media ko tavajjo detaa he, jinaki tiarapy oonchi he
 The market has nothing to do with how aware the people watching the channel or reading the newspaper, how accurate the analysis of the program was, and how satisfied the audience was
 kai jaankaar maanate hai ki darshakon kii taadaad par focus karne ke chakkar main media darshakon kii quality par dhyaan dena bhul jaataa he
 According to a book titled Media Freedom, "the rhythm of sports news, the exciting live coverage of the political ups and downs, the wars being fought abroad are now available in the safe wall of the home - news programs till the late 80s
 This mixture of information and entertainment started to be called infotainment - "today, this genre of infotainment has been fully accepted as news
 yah pahalu bhi bazaarwaad kii hi dein he, par kitne log cricket kii manoranjak match report yaa syria main chal rahi hinsa ke vishleshan ko bazaar se jodate hai, yah jaananaa dilachasp hoga
 Hindustan audiences are more liberal than abroad
 media main bazaarwaad ke ek aise prabhaav kii bhi charchaa videsh main he, jise shaayad bhartiya darshak saalon se bagaiyr sawaal kiye kubul kar chuke hai
 In this era, the media is blamed for over simplification to pull the audience
 apni kitaab ‘da interple of influence- news, edwartiging, politics and da internet’ main katholin haul jemisan likhti hai ki tivi news kii khabaron ko paanch main se ek shrenee ke hisaab se banaaya jaataa he
 * Pretense vs
 reality * little man vs
 big man * good vs
 evil * efficiency vs
 inefficiency (agility vs
 lethargy) * amazing vs
 simple According to Kathleen, everything in the world falls under the category of white or black, the concept is wrong
 yah samaaj kii soch ko saral banane kii bajaay ulajhaa detaa he
 The media actually tries to provide only such a structure, which can be easily sold in the market, which can be used for commercial use
 bharat main agar media or bazaarwaad par charchaa hoti he, to yah us pahalu ko ujagar karne kii koshish he ki hamaare desh kii badi-badi samasyaon ko kya dilachasp khabaron kii vajah se nazarandaaj kiya jaataa he
 How to create a balance: Is the media stuck in the clutches of marketism, does the existence of news, the importance of news, only weigh in market scales, does only TRP decide which form of news will be presented? Aaj Tak's managing Editor Supriya Prasad says, "the biggest news of the day, all the channels are showing at the same time
 aapke channel par hi us khabar ko dekhne ke liye darshak kyon aaenge, isaki kai vajahen ho sakati hai
 The first is, the image of your channel, that is, if people think you are the fastest, then they know where to go to know the whole news, but many times the treatment of news also pulls the viewers towards themselves
 ’’spasht he, khabaron ko dikhaane ke liye jab channelon kii hode he, to darshak khinchne kii hode hona bhi laazmi he
 At the moment, there is a different assessment of what is going on in the media industry, which is right, sometimes burdensome with confusion, but what should happen - how to balance it, it is important
 khabar ko rochak banane ke sakaaratmak upaay aajamaaye jane chahie
 For example, if showing an account of the Parliament, if the account of the business is also shown, then the news will get reference
 kisi sadsy kii kahi hui koi baat, agar purv main kahi unheen kii kisi baat se ulat he, to isse bhi najariya milegaa
 Such items are called value addition and are interesting to the audience as well as enlightening
 khabaron main pakshpaat ko lekar america kaa ek udhaaharan bhi dilachasp he
 In 2008, George W
 Bush's press secretary, Scott mcclellan, admitted in his book that he regularly leaked news to the media on the instructions of superiors that were not completely true
 in khabaron ko media tathy ke taur par pesh kiya karata tha
 mcclellan wrote that the press wants to show the truth broadly and with the truth, but most journalists and networks support the White House
 bharat main shaayad itani sachai se koi netaa yaa raajnneetijna aisi baton ko kubul nahin karegaa
 It is also necessary to understand that the scope of news does not start with politics and end with politics
 khel se lekar sena, filmon se lekar saamaajik mudde, sabhi khabar hai
 The precise mix of all these news within a twenty-four-hour radius is a solution to many problems
 mushkil tab khadi hoti he, jab kisi bhi ek tarah kii khabar par zarurat se zyada focus kiya jaataa he
 As long as the details of any crime are given, it is news, but every half an hour, the details of the incident goes on many times in the category of sensation
 media ko isse bachane kii zarurat he
 Producing news is the responsibility of the producers in a channel, that is, how the language of the script, how the pictures are presented with the story, how the music is presented to the producers, but the reporter has a big responsibility to be balanced
 Who bring news live tivi ke daur main yah bada khatra he ki bagaiyr acchhee tarah vichaar kiye kisi khabar kii camentry kerani he
 In a press talk, what is there in a hundred things that have to be highlighted
 jo baaten reporter live kehete hai, yani jinamein sochane-samajhane kaa vakt na ke baraabar hota he, amuman yahi channel kii line lenth kaa andaja logon ke dimag main chhodte hai
 That is why treating the news as just a news, refraining from stating your point of view, these are the few spells on which the media will be able to save themselves from most of the allegations of bias if the reporters persist
 darasal akhabaaron main khabaron ke liye baaki panne or raay rakhane ke liye edetorial hota he, par choubees ghante ke tivi news channelon main bahes ke sho bhi hote hai, jahaan tippanee karte hue ankar raay hi rakhata he, to har report ke baad us khabar par ek coment karnaa bhi aam ho chukaa he, yani tivi media kaa har minute ab sampadakeey se bojhil he
 Another aspect of the balance is included in the basic learning of media studies
 vah yah ki kisi bhi khabar kaa keval ek pahalu nahin dikhaanaa chahie
 If there is a dispute, then the matter of each party should be kept in front
 agar koi baat karne se inkaar kare to is baat ko bhi spasht subut ke saath logon ke samaksh rakhaa jaae, taaki faisla channel na de, balki darshak le saken
 For example, if the government presents a report as a statement of its functioning, then it is the responsibility of the reporter to talk to the people for whom it is claimed to work
 agar log santusht hai, tab bhi
 Even if people reject the claims of the government, however, many times these things are ignored in the era of instant news
 khabar kii gaharaai tak utarane main naakaami nishpakshta par gaharaa prahaar karti he
 The balance in the news is not rocket science
 aavashyak keval yah he ki patrakarita ke buniyadi siddhanton ko yaad rakhaa jaae
 It is the key to the balance in those simple principles
 unheen main bazaarwaad ke yug main, bazaar se mukt rahane kaa samoochaa sabak samaaya he
 Economic freedom is a major basis for ideological freedom
 is buniyaad par kya bhartiya media azaad he ? ise samajhane ke liye hamen news channelon kaa bijness model samajhnaa hoga or us model ko samajhane se pehle hamen hindustan main news channelon kaa vistaar bhi dekhnaa hoga
 The first decade of the twenty-first century saw an unprecedented rise by the news media
 naye niyam-kanoon bazaar ke liye upyukt the
 License fees were low
 lihaaja broadcast media ne achaanak oochaal dekha
 Nearly thirty years ago, where there was a TV station in India, several hundred channels expanded in a few years
 soochna evam prasaaran mantralay kii ek report ke mutabik 2013 tak bharat main 438 manoranjan or 410 news channel the
 Though the number of channels was increasing on the one hand, on the other hand the global slowdown and the slow pace of the domestic economy were proving to be the stepping stones of the media industry
 mandi kaa vipareet asar edwatising revenue par hua or ghanghor pratispardhaa vaale bazaar main badi taadaad main mediakarmiyon kii naukariyaan gayin
 Many channels were closed, and many kept swinging on the verge of closure
 kisi bhi naye channel ko launch karne ke liye fund kii zarurat hoti he
 This fund comes in the form of investors, but the role of investors does not end here, but for the coming one and a half to two years, the channel depends on the investors
 agar dhire-dhire channel lokapriy ho jaataa he or darshakon ko aakarshith karne lagata he to kareeb kareeb do saal main vah brake ivan kar letaa he, yani aisi sthiti hasil kar letaa he, jahaan na munafa he, na nuksaan
 After this, advertisers start coming in and the channel starts making profits
 lekin yah ek adarsh sthiti he
 The number of TV news channels in India is so high that there is competition all over
 kai channel brake ivan karne main hi chaar saal se adhik laga dete hai
 Neither is there so much restraint among the investors, nor is there much patience in the channel workers
 baharhaal haal ke varshon main kai aise channel launch kiye gayi, jinamein rajanetaaon, bilderon kaa paisa laga tha
 The names of many such people also appeared in the investor list, whose means of earning was doubtful
 adhiktar maamalon main in logon ne isiilie paise lagaaye, kyonki apana agenda saadhane kii inaki nijee zarurat thi
 Obviously, it had an impact on not only one channel, but the entire market
 darasal tivi industry ke niyantran niyam itane lachar hai ki kai dfa ise mani londering ke liye bhi istemaal kiya jaataa he, taaki blike mani ko white kiya ja sake
 Let us now understand the business model of the TV industry
 adhiktar viksit tivi market main 70 pratishat kamai sabsakripshan se aati he or 30 fisadi edwartigig revenue se, lekin itane saalon baad bhi bharat main iskaa ulataa he
 On an average, 95 percent of the revenue of a news channel in India comes from advertising and 5 percent from cable subscriptions
 isamen bhi agar koi bada news channel he, to use pe channel hone kii sahuuliyat milti he or sabsakripshan revenue hasil hota he, par chote channelon ke maamle main kai dfa sabsakripshan revenue na ke baraabar hota he
 That is, eventually the fight remains of the TRP
 channel chalaanaa he to lokapriyata ke paimaane par khud ko sabit karne kii zarurat uthati he
 Many times when the TRP battle becomes fierce, the channels are forced to take the content to a level that is shown only to gain TV ratings
 bade network khud ko is jaddojahad se to bachaa lete hai, par tivi news industry main us daur ko koun bhul paaya he, jab achaanak ajab-gajab or andhvishwaas kii sansanikhej khabaren chaa gai thim or kamobesh sabhi channel bhedchaal main lag gayi the
 There is no doubt that journalism is an important pillar of democracy, but the business model of channels in India makes them more dependent on the market than necessary
 yahaan news channelon kii anginat samasyaayein hai
 Revenue from subscription is negligible
 pratispardhaa atyadhik he or edwartigers ke paas anek vikalp hai, yani revenue ko lekar molbhav kii shakti channelon kii kam or edwartigers kii zyada hoti he
 Does relying too much on advertising make news media fairness? Recall the era of Nirmal Baba here, when he used to give treatment of serious problem with chat and golagappa chutney
 jis vakt is vivaad ko news channelon ne dikhaaya, us vakt lagbhag sabhi channelon par ve aid dete the
 Nevertheless this news was shown
 isi tarah jab coca cola or pepsy main pastiside kii khabar saamne aayi, tab ye donon companiyaan bharat main sabase badi edwartigers thim
 Despite this, the dispute was carried out
 yani bijness model ek ore he or news media kii nishpakshta duusari ore, lekin pakshpaat ke khatre se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa, saath hi ye sabhi udhaaharan sab par lagu nahin kiye ja sakate
 In such circumstances every channel has its own stand

 Another aspect of the NBA is self-invitations, for which it issues guidelines through the Code of Ethics and Broadcasting Standards

 The nba's role in quality control is important, especially if an audience has objections to the content of a channel, the NBA becomes a way to address this complaint
 darshak sidhaa us channel se shikaayat kar sakate hai
 If the channel does not take cognizance of this or if the viewers are not satisfied with the steps taken by the channel, then it can complain to the NBA
 agar phir bhi 14 dinon ke bheetar channel jawaab nahin detaa, to us channel ko enbie dwaara sho coj notice jari kiya ja saktaa he
 The Jury of Peers in the NBA has the right to decide the punishment
 yah 9 sadasyeey athurity he, jiske maujuuda adhyaksh purv chif justise (ritred) jees verma hai
 The NBA has the right to call erring news channels for production
 sunwaayee ke baad agar galati sabit hoti he, to chetavanee dene kaa adhikaar bhi enbie ke paas he
 In case of showing false news or violating NBA guidelines, the said channel can also be fined and they can be given on-screen written apology for their mistake in prime time
 andhvishwaas ko badhaava detii ek khabar chalaane kaa doshi paye jane par 18 / 4 / 2012 ke ek aadesh ke jariye news 24 ko screen par likhit maafee maangani padi thi

 The simple answer is, TRP

 Like Corporate Social Responsibility, Media Social Responsibility can be applied as a rule, so that the news of interest of the people is given the same attention with interesting shows and everyday news

 In a remote school, if children are forced to read in the open without a roof, then not only questions arise, but the news goes on till the accountability is fixed

 In the Lok Sabha elections, many political parties of the country have completely collapsed in the fierce wave of Narendra Modi
 desh ke sabase bade soobe uttar pradesh main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko jahaan apane durg amethi main karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 At the same time, 'yadav Kunba' has completely collapsed except Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav
 iske alaava purv pradhanmantri choudhary charan singh kii viraasat sambhaal rahe choudhary ajit singh or jayant choudhary sapa-basapa ke saath gathbandhan kii sawari ke baad bhi apni siten nahin bachaa sake hai
 The political dominance of mulayam-chaudhary's clan in the politics of Uttar Pradesh is well known
 in donon pariwaron ke raajnneetik ilaake or jaateey sameekaran bhi hai, jinke sahare soobe kii siyasat main apana dam dikhaate rahe hai
 While the Mulayam family has been reaching the threshold of power with the help of yadav-muslim votes, the Chaudhary Charan family has been rubbing power with the help of the jat-muslim equation
 lekin, narendra modi kii rashtriya raajnneeti main dastak dene ke baad donon kunbon kaa sameekaran puri tarah se chunaav dar chunaav dharaashai hota najar aa rahaa he
 In this Lok Sabha election, 5 members of the Mulayam family had contested from their traditional seats
 inamen mainpuri seat se mulaayam singh yadav, azamgarh se akhilesh yadav, kannauj se dimple yadav, sanbhal se dharmendra yadav or firozabad se akshay yadav chunavi maidan main the
 Among them, only Mulayam Singh and Akhilesh Yadav have been able to save their seats

 is tarah se mana ja rahaa tha ki dalit-muslim-yadav sameekaran ke jariye sapa in siton par jeet darj karne main safal rahegi lekin yah nattejey main tabdeel nahin ho sakaa he
 Looking at the results of these seats, his uncle Shivpal Yadav has played an important role in the defeat of Ram Gopal Yadav's son Akshay Yadav in Firozabad seat
 sapa se naata todakar alag party banaakar chunavi maidan main utre shivpal 91869 hasil karke akshay ke jeet kii raah main roda ban gaye
 BJP won this seat with 28781
 is tarah se badaayun loksabhaa seat par dharmendra yadav ke haar kii vajah congress se chunavi maidan main utre saleem sherwani mukhya vajah bane
 Dharmendra Yadav has been defeated by bjp's Sanghamitra Maurya since 18454
 is seat par sherwani ko 51947 vot mili hai
 Akhilesh Yadav's wife Dimple Yadav was contesting on the Kannauj Lok Sabha seat, but the victory was denied
 yahaan se diphl yadav ko 12353 maton se haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa he
 Like the Mulayam family, Chaudhary Ajit Singh's legacy of Chaudhary Charan has completely come to an end
 ajit singh ne apni raajnneetik vajood ko bachaane ke liye sapa-basapa ke saath haath milaayaa
 Even after this, Ajit Singh has lost from Muzaffarnagar seat and Jayant Chaudhary Baghpat seat
 iskaa jayant choudhary ko bijepi ke satyapal singh ne 23502 maton se haraaya or choudhary ajit singh ko sanjeev baalion ne 6526 maton se haraaya
 Even in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the father-son could not save their seats

 In fact, the Committee of Administrators (COA), which administers Indian cricket, has entrusted the task of selecting the next national coach to the ad hoc committee headed by Kapil Dev and the decision may lead to differences in the Supreme Court-appointed panel
 tadarth samiti main purv bhartiya captain kapil dev, anshuman gaekwad or shanta ramaswami hai or unhone isse pehle disambar main dablyuvi raman ko bhartiya mahila team kaa coach niyukt kiya tha
 One member confirmed that BCCI has also approached him to select the head coach of the men's team
 isse pehle jab sioe main do sadsy chairman vinod raay or purv bhartiya captain dyna adulji the
 Of these, Edulji had termed the women's coach selection process unconstitutional
 unka kahana tha ki keval cricket salaahkaar samiti (siesi) hi coach kaa chayan kar sakati he
 The COA is now a three-member panel
 farvari main leftinent general ravi thodge ko isamen shaamil kiya gaya tha
 But the future of the CAC has serious concerns, including Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman
 isliye sioe ne tadarth samiti ko yah kaam saunpna uchit samajha
 Tendulkar has been freed from allegations of conflict of interest
 vahiin bisisiai samvidhan ke tahat ganguli or lakshmana ko apni kai bhoomikaaon main se kisi ek kaa chayan karne ke liye kaha gaya he
 The COA, however, has not yet decided on it
 kapil dev or ramaswami bhi hiton ke takaraav ke daayre main aate hai kyonki bisisiai samvidhan ke anusaar ve bhi khilaadiyon ke sangh ke gathan ke liye jimmedaar hai
 The BCCI on Tuesday invited applications for the support staff of the men's team, including the head coach

 com / beetwh2tdb— bhaajapa maharashtra (@bjp4maharashtra)october 13, 2019aaj jalgaanv main piem kii ralibhartiya janata party ravivaar se maharashtra main puure chunavi mod main he
 The CM started the Mahajan Sampark Abhiyan, in addition to this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will start election rallies in Maharashtra from today
 piem modi maharashtra main 9 chunavi reliyaan sambodhit karenge
 PM Modi will start his election campaign on Sunday at rallies in Jalgaon and Sakoli in Bhandara district
 unhone bataaya ki pradhanmantri 16 oktober ko akola, jaalnaa ke parthur or thane ke eroli main chunavi sabhaaon ko sambodhit karenge
 The next day, Modi will hold election rallies in Beed's Parli and in Pune and Satara
 bijepi se mili jaankaree ke mutabik chunaav se teen din pehle 18 oktober ko modi mumbai main 'grand phinale raily' ko sambodhit karenge
 After all, Rahul Gandhi got angry on Narendra Modi
 narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhana to dur, ab tak vah apane chunavi bhaashanon main modi kaa naam tak nahin lete the
 Till now his target was BJP and its ideology
 modi kaa naam liye bagaiyr jarur rahul gandhi ne kai baar un par baantne or nafrat kii raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 For the past one week, Rahul and Sonia Gandhi have started attacking Modi directly
 isamen snupaget kaa zikrakar mahilaon kii jasusi or unki suraksha ke sawaal uthaanaa shaamil rahaa he
 But on Wednesday, Rahul Gandhi uttered the strongest attack on Modi
 'indian express' ke mutabik buudhvaar ko chhattisgarh ke baalod main rahul gandhi ne ek raily ko sambodhan main kaha, "modi piem bananaa chahta he
 He will do anything for that
 wo tukade-tukade kar degaa
 
 
 
 wo ek ko duusare se ladaa degaa
 " rahul gandhi yaheen nahin ruke
 He also commented on BJP internal affairs
 modi par adwani or jaswant singh jaise netaaon ko kinare karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Rahul also said that everything is being given in the hands of one person in BJP
 rahul gandhi ne gujarat or mujffarnagar dangon ke liye bijepi ko jimmedaar bhi tehraaya
 These tweets of Rahul give a glimpse of the changed strategy of Congress regarding Modi
 abhi tak rahul gandhi apane bhaashanon main khud kii chhavi ko ek jimmedaar or gambhir netaa ke taur par pesh karte rahe hai
 His attempt to present himself as a resentful youth fighting the system while back in the system backfired
 daagi netaaon ko bachaane ke liye jari kiye gaye adhyadesh ko fadkar phenkane ke apane bayaan par baad main unhen khud hi khed jataana padaa
 While in his only TV interview, he avoided taking Modi's name
 is bare main baar-baar poochne par bhi unhone iskaa koi sidhaa jawaab nahin diya
 In fact, Congress has understood that it has no strategy to counter Modi
 kabhi party main modi ke bare main chup rahane ke bare main faisla hota he, kabhi duusari yaa teesri qatari ke netaa un par hamalaa karte hai
 The Congress feels that Modi uses it as a weapon to reverse every attack on him
 aisa gujarat ke vidhansabha chunaavon main ho chukaa he
 Especially in the 2007 election, when Modi used the statement of Sonia Gandhi, who described herself as a 'merchant of death', in her own favor
 congress ko lagata tha ki modi ke pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banane ke baad chunaav main ekmaatr mudda sampradayikta banaam dharmanirpekshata ho jayega or iske jariye vah muslim maton kaa dhruvikaran apane paksh main kar sakegi
 But Modi did not give priority to any issue related to Hindutva in the election campaign and he has made sharp attacks one after the other on the UPA government on issues of development, governance, inflation and corruption
 ye aise mudde hai jin par congress apana bachaav nahin kar paati
 This whole election campaign took a new turn with Congress President Sonia Gandhi meeting with the Imam of Jama Masjid and the subsequent appeal not to split the 'secular' vote
 aisa laga ki congress ab is chunaav main modi ke aane kaa dar dikhaakar muslim matadaataaon par khulkar dore daal rahi he, taaki apane paksh main unka dhruvikaran kiya ja sake
 Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party in Uttar Pradesh and Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad in Bihar are also repeatedly accusing Modi of spreading communalism under this strategy
 bijepi ne bhi iskaa jawaab diya
 In the politics of polarization, he also opened his cards
 mujffarnagar main bijepi mahasachiv amit shah kaa 'badla' lene vaala bayaan isi ranneeti kaa hissaa he, jisamen bijepi hinduon kaa dhruvikaran karnaa chaah rahi he
 Party strategists call it reverse polarization or counter-polarization
 party ke ghoshnaptr main ram mandir, dhara 370 or samaan naagarik samhita jaise muddon ko phir jagah de di gai
 Whatever Rahul Gandhi has said about Modi at the rally in Chhattisgarh, this strategy of the Congress is clear
 tukade-tukade karne kii baat, ek ko duusare se ladaane ke baat, ye vahi aarope hai, jo modi par gujarat ke 2002 ke dangon ke baad se lagate rahe hai
 Ironically, whenever Modi's communal image was questioned, he took advantage of it in Gujarat
 ab sawaal yah he ki rahul ke tazaa hamalon ke baad kya hoga? modi iskaa kis tarah se jawaab dete hai? or asli muddon se bhatke is chunaav main kya prachaar phir patari par waapas aa paaegaa? The spark of political violence in West Bengal during the Lok Sabha elections has not been extinguished yet
 lagaataar bengal main hinsa kii khabaren saamne aa rahi hai to bhartiya janata party (BJP) or trinmul congress (TMC) main chal rahi jang or bhi tej ho rahi he
 Now that the BJP has demanded the resignation of Mamta Banerjee, then the protest in the state is also going on
 bijepi ne somvaar ko rajya main kaala diwas manaaya, to mangalvaar ko bhi rajya main kai jagah pradarshan karne kaa plan he
 The BJP will perform in Kolkata today, with leaders marching up to the police headquarters
 bhaajapa kaa aarope he ki abhi tak rajya main 84 logon kii maut ho gai he, haalanki tiemasi kaa kahana he ki rajya main sthiti thik he
 Governor Kesarinath Tripathi met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday in the midst of this political dispute in the state
 mulaakaat se pehle atakalein lagaai ja rahi thim ki is mulaakaat main rajya main bigadati kanoon vyavastha par charchaa ho sakati he or baat raashtrapati shashan tak pahunch sakati he
 However, the governor later told that there was no such thing, it was just a courtesy meeting
 aise main kisi tarah ke kayaas lagaana thik nahin hoga
 The situation in Bengal's 24 Parganas deteriorated on the day some activists were killed after a debate over the flag
 inamen bijepi or tiemasi ke donon hi kaaryakarta shaamil the
 Lok Sabha elections are continuing: During the Lok Sabha elections, the fight between TMC and BJP was intensified
 idhar se piem modi-amit shah samet puri bijepi tiemasi par hamalavar the, to vahiin mamata banerjee bhi palatwaar kar rahi thim
 Not only the big leaders, but also the electoral war was going on among the workers
 matdaan ke dauraan kai kaaryakartaaon kii maut hui, poling booth main desi bam barasaaye gaye
 The BJP alleged that Mamata Banerjee is killing democracy in the state
 bijepi kaa ye kathan abhi tak chal rahaa he
 However, the BJP has become more aggressive after the election is over
 lagaataar uski taraf se tiemasi ke samarthakon or kaaryakartaaon ko apni party main shaamil karne kaa silsilaa jari he
 So at the same time, bjp's Bengal in-charge Kailash Vijayvargiya has said that if this continues, we will demand imposition of President's rule in Bengal
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ne bengal main apni jameen ko kaaphi had tak badhaayaa
 In Bengal with 42 Lok Sabha seats, TMC now has 22, while BJP has 18 seats
 yahi kaaran he ki ab donon raajnneetik dalon kii taraf se mishan 2021 kii taiyaari shuru ho gai he

 If the son committed the crime, should the father be sent to jail? Why didn't the ED bring the will on record? For 100 days in judicial custody, the ED has given two notes to the Supreme Court in Sealcover

 Chidambaram influential person: Tushar Solicitor General Mehta further said that the accused were in the post of Finance Minister

 We are collecting evidence to prove this
 shell yani chhadam company kaagajon par thi
 Such companies were formed abroad
 khaastaur se videsh main banaai gai companiyon ke bare main jaanch main pataa chalaa
 After the victory in UP, the BJP is now trying to show that now even Muslims are not avoiding it
 bhale hi upi main bijepi par dhravikaran ke aarope lage hon or yogi adityanath ko mukhyamantri banaakar party kii chhavi ko muslim virdohi bataaya ja rahaa ho, lekin bijepi kii daleel he ki upi ke musalamaanon kaa vot bhi is baar bijepi ko mila he
 Redeeming the same, now before the MCD elections in Delhi, the BJP is trying to get Muslim leaders of other parties into its fold
 shuukravaar ko bijepi ke dilli daftar main sainkadon musalamaanon ko swaagat dhol dhamaakon ke saath kiya gaya
 All the Muslim leaders and activists of Congress and Aam Aadmi Party joined BJP in presence of East Delhi MP Mahesh Giri and Delhi BJP President Sakshamnoj Tiwari
 do din pehle bhi manoj tiwari ke ghar par aam aadmi party se aae muslim netaaon ko party main shaamil karaayaa gaya tha
 The names of Abrar Chaudhary, Wasim Saifi, Javed Khan, Yusuf Jamal, Javed Chaudhary, Fariyad Khan, Asad Khan, Rajat Khan, Rais Khan were loudly announced by Delhi BJP Minority Front President Atif Rashid and his involvement in BJP Announced
 aatif rashid ke mutabik bijepi ke naam par musalamaanon ko saalon se daraaya gaya, unhen dar dikhaaya gaya ki agar bijepi satta main aayi to musalamaanon ko kha jaaegi, lekin ye sab musalamaanon ke vot batorne ke liye kiya gaya lekin ab modi sarkaar aane ke baad tay ho gaya he ki musalamaanon kaa vikaas hoga to bijepi ke shashan main hi hoga
 Atif Rashid alleged that now Yogi's name is being intimidated, but now Muslims cannot be tricked and Muslims joining BJP are examples of this, though Manoj Tiwari was asked if Muslims should be asked in MCD elections If he was given a ticket, he did not deny it, but remained silent on the question

 General Ashfaq Parvez Kiyani will be succeeded by Lt Gen Raheel Sharif, the new head of the Pakistani Army
 pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif ne buudhvaar ko iskaa elaan kiya
 General Sharif is considered close to the family of the Prime Minister of Pakistan
 iske alaava unhen maujuuda general kayaani kaa bhi rhite hand kaha jaataa he
 Apart from this, PM Sharif has made Lt General Rashid Mehmood the head of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee
 raashtrapati mamun hossain ne donon niyuktiyon ko apni manjuuri de di he
 Both PM and Kayani are close to the new general lieutenant General Sharif, replacing 61-year-old General Ashfaq Parvez Kiyani, who is going to retire on Friday after taking command of the army for six years
 leftinent general sharif apane shaury ke liye desh kaa pratishthit nishaan-e-haidar sammaan hasil karne vaale shabbir sharif ke bhai hai, jo 1971 main bharat ke saath yuddh main maare gaye the
 It is said that Sharif has very good relations with former army chiefs and top officials, as well as those who deeply interfered in the politics of Lahore
 mahmud ke navaj parivaar ke saath achche rishte hai or vah kayaani ke vishwaasapatro main ek hai
 He is said to be Kayani's right hand
 leftinent sharif ne isse pehle gujranvala kor ke commander, pakistan sainya academy kakul ke commander or general afisar commanding lahore se bhi mulaakaat kii
 On the other hand, Lieutenant Mehmood has served as the Lahore Corps Commander and has also been the military secretary of former President Rafiq Tarar
 mahmud baloch regiment ke hai or unhone iesai ke up mahanideshak ke taur par general kayaani ke maatahat kaam kiya he
 Both generals are preferred over Lieutenant General Aaron Islam, who is currently the most senior general after Kayani and the chief of the logistics staff
 vah april main seva nivrutt hone vaale hai
 Kayani was elected as army chief in 2007 by former military ruler General Pervez Musharraf
 unhen pradhanmantri usuf raja jilani ne 2010 main teen varsh kaa abhootpurv kaary vistaar diya
 Sharif has been cheated by his general twice, choosing the army chief is not an easy task for the civilian government and in this case, it is not at all for Sharif who has cheated twice
 yah chauthaa mauka he, jab sharif ne kisi sena pramukh kaa chayan kiya he
 He made Abdul Waheed Kakar the army chief in 1993, but he betrayed Sharif and there was a time when he played a key role in leading Sharif to resign
 kaakar ko kam se kam chaar varisht general par tarjeeh di gai thi
 In 1998, Sharif preferred Pervez Musharraf over at least two generals, but he sparked a rebellion against the prime minister in 1999, as well as plotting the Kargil conflict
 aktubar 1999 main sharif ne jiyauddin batt ko chunaa, lekin musharraf kii failaai baghawat ke kaaran vah shapath nahin le paae
 The new army chief has been given the assignment at a time when foreign forces are returning from Afghanistan and a dialogue game is going on between the Pakistani Taliban and the Nawaz Sharif government
 bharat ke saath sarkaar ke rajanyik daanvpech ke saath hi unhen america, china or khadi deshon ke saath rishton kii naiya paar lagaani he or gharelu morche par bhi kai chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa he
 The powerful leader Indira Gandhi was to become like a goddess in Indian culture, in a culture in which the Mother Goddess is worshiped
 rahasy kii samrajnibhartiya upmahadweep ke mithkon main ve ab bhi ek vismayakari upasthiti hai
 She is the mother of innumerable people
 saakshaat durga
 Empress of the secret
 vyamoh kii murti
 Indira Gandhi is still alive in people's minds as an embodiment of affection, admiration, worship and fear
 31 aktubar kii subah unki hatya ke 25 saal baad aaj bhi hamen unki kami mahasoos hoti he or aisa un logon dwaara kii jane vaali juthi yaad ke kaaran nahin he, jo unki smriti ke aayojan ke maujuuda aavesh main unki rajnatik viraasat kaa copirite rakhane kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 So is it because she was an exception, or a reflection of the distortion of the current political leadership? Her journey from a silent doll in the walls of Anand Bhavan in Allahabad to the almighty lady of 1, Safdarjung Road in Delhi and then to make a place in the collective consciousness of the whole of India - or the slim, lonely "indu" His journey from becoming the favorite Indira of the people tells the emotion and secret of power
 vanshanugat raajnneeti main sarvaadhik sthaayee viraasatve shabd jo aaj satta kii tuchchhata ko abhivyakt karte hai-jaise vansh parampara or loklubhaavanavaad - unke vikaas ke aakhyaan maamle main ek alag hi arth dhvanit karte hai
 This image of Gandhi is not a dhoti and charkha to the knee, but a starchy sari with a cut and half-length hair near the ears and this is the most enduring legacy in hereditary politics today
 vansh parampara motilal nehru se judi hone ke baavjood isaki shuruyaat khud unase hui or unhone khud apane rakt se iskaa abhishek kiya
 As with every dynasty, at the very beginning they were told of the symbiosis between their fate and history
 unke pita ne, jo hameshaa hi unhen prerak kathaayen sunaate rahete the, unhen patr likhaa ki unka janm roosi kranti ke maheene main hua tha, yani ''tufaan or sankat'' ke sansar main
 This storm will continue till the end of their life but they will not bow down to it
 apni santanon, pote-potiyon or bahu ke vipareet unki shuruyaat aasaan nahin hogi
 He first had to struggle within his party and win
 or ve koi saadhaaran log nahin the, or na hi ve unase yaa unki prishthbhumi se aatankit the
 When Vajpayee called Indira Durga, the people were not as successful or weak Congress leaders as the Congressmen of today
 aaj ke congressi netaa gandhi parivaar kii aashwastipurna chaaya ke bina apane astitv kii kalpana bhi nahin kar sakate hai
 Nor did the original Mrs
 Gandhi rise due to the pleading of the weeping crowds of Congressmen
 unhen to syndicate ke bujurg or ghaagh congressiyon ko, jo unhen sirf apane haathon kii kathputli samajhate the, pachhad kar apni jagah kaayam kerani thi
 For this, he had to be ruthless
 kisi bhi mahaan netaa kii kahani hameshaa hi ek nausikhue ke rup main shuru hoti he, jo tathakthith 'kingmekaron' ko shikast dekar aage badhata he
 The powerful leader Indira Gandhi was to become like a goddess in Indian culture, in a culture in which the Mother Goddess is worshiped
 yahaan tak ki kavi swabhaav vaale atal bihari vaajapeyi bhi bangladesh banane ke baad umangith sansad main indira gandhi ke liye durga ke visheshan kaa prayog karne se khud ko roak nahin paae
 The most beloved leader was Indiraham also knows that in politics the Goddess and the Gods are adept in the art of popularity, who know the art of playing with public sentiments
 eva peron se lekar emelda marcos or jayalalita tak ko lokapriyata hasil karne kii is kala ne hi janata kaa chaheta bana diya
 Mrs Gandhi's socialist populism, which closely matched the policies of the Soviet Union, was a more sophisticated art at the national level
 isane jaldi hi unhen sabhi logon kaa sabase priy netaa bana diya
 When the weak slogan of 'indira Hatao' was launched by the opposition, they raised a hollow slogan of 'garibi Hatao' in response, but it was enough to confuse the public
 jab unhen nishaanaa banaaya gaya to unhone apane virodhiyon ko aisa murkh bana diya jaise un par nishaanaa sadhana deshadroh ho
 He made himself indispensable to the countrymen just like India
 apatkaal devi ke rup main pratishthit hasti ke vibhram kii abhivyakti thi
 In order to reinforce the myth of the goddess protecting them, an enemy was needed at a time which his father would call "storm and crisis"
 isamen unhen shikast khaani padi
 He then won and was eventually murdered
 goongi gudiya se taqatvar netaaj ham starch lagi sooti sari main tej kadamon se chalati us mahila kii jhalak dekhte hai
 The new version of Mrs
 Gandhi is now India's most powerful leader, and that too without being officially in power
 ve bhi chunaav jeet rahi hai
 Then why is it that the original version still dominates the heartland of the country? When there was a need for action, there was no middle ground for Indira nor did she feel the need to bring anyone in the middle
 lohia kii ''goongi gudiya'' aage chalakar nirmam, karishmai or taqatvar shaasha ban gai
 The country ignored their mistakes because people could never differentiate between their interest and the wider national interest
 apni hatya se ek din pehle unhone bhubaneshwar main ek chunavi sabha main kaha thah ''main aaj yahaan hum ho saktaa he, kal main na rahun
 But i do not care whether i live or die
 maine lanbaa jivan jiya he or mujhe garv he ki maine apane logon kii seva main apana puraa jivan laga diya
 And when i die, every strand of my blood will work for the country and strengthen it
 '' ye ek aisi netaa ke shabd the jiskaa vishwaas tha ki logon ke saath uskaa bhaavnaatmak rishta tha
 They still exist today because those who are selling their martyrdom or imitating their style are probably not aware of the country that loved Indira
 kamjor vyakti kabhi indira kaa vaaris nahin ban saktaa, vah unki sirf nakal hi ban saktaa he

 prashaskon kii samiti (sioe) ne guuruuvaar ko faisla kiya he ki koi bhi adhikari or siio ab se cricket samiti kii baithak kaa hissaa nahin honge
 Until now, the selection committee had to take the secretary in the loop in its decisions, but the COA has decided that will no longer happen
 sioe ke is faisle par ab bhartiya cricket control board (bisisiai) ke adhikariyon kaa gussa foot padaa he
 a senior BCCI official told IANS whether the COA is not yet aware of the rules of the constitution? Will it take them a year to understand the constitution that the committee has prepared itself? adhikari ne kaha, 'bisisiai ke nae samvidhan ko sarvocch adaalat ne dekha he or isliye yah jaruri he ki uskaa paalan kiya jaae
 It has been almost a year since it was registered, but why has it been a dawn for the COA? What happened that woke them up? Do they not know what is happening on the board? ”the official said that if the constitution is to be followed, the officers should also be allowed to work according to the new rules
 adhikari ne kaha, 'kya wo adhikariyon ko bhi nae samvidhan ke tahat kaam karne denge yaa phir ye sirf unhen rokna chaahate hai
 According to the new constitution, officers are those who have previously been a part of the apex council, and if the COA thinks that it is the apex council, then the court-appointed officials can attend the meeting
 'unhone kaha, 'yah saaf he ki nae samvidhan ke mutabik adhikariyon ko kaary karne par roak he, aise main yah sioe dwaara 'pick and chooj' niti ko apnaanaa he
 'another officer further said that if you look at other issues, no steps have been taken towards the formation of the cricket committee, which has the responsibility of testing the selection, coaching and performance of the team
 Also under Rule 26 of the new constitution of BCCI, but this has not been taken care of yet
 aap sioe ko sirf is tarah ke muddon par kaam karte dekhenge
 Therefore, the COA itself is not accepting the BCCI constitution
 'unhone kaha, 'cricket salaahkaar samiti (sioe) ke sandarbh main sarvocch adaalat ne sioe ko adhikaar de rakhe hai ki vah chunaav na hone tak siesi se chayankartaaon kii niyukti ko lekar charchaa kare, jiskaa saaf sa matlab he ki siesi chunaavon tak kaam karnaa jari rakhegi or iske baad agm main nai siesi kaa gathan hoga do nai chayan samiti chunegi, lekin ham jaanate hai ki kya ho rahaa he
 The COA has said that the selection committee does not need a secretary or CEO for any kind of selection
 saath hi chayan samitiyon ko kanvener baithak bula sakate hai na ki sachiv
 The COA, however, has given some leeway for foreign tours, according to which the administrative manager will be responsible for the meeting
 sachiv ko baithak sambandhit jaankaree hogi, taaki wo record ke liye kaam aa sake

 Jung that after all who will ride a bicycle? Both father Mulayam and son Akhilesh faction claim the cycle symbol
 donon hi gut cycle par apni daavedaari ko lekar chunaav ayog tak pahunch gaye hai
 On Monday afternoon, a meeting of leaders of the anti-akhilesh group took place at Mulayam Singh Delhi residence, which included Mulayam Singh, Shivpal Yadav, Amar Singh, Jayaprada and Ambika Chaudhary
 baithak ke baad mulaayam, shivpal, amar singh or jaya pradaa chunaav ayog main apni shikaayat lekar pahunche
 On the other hand, sources are quoted as saying that last time the SP leader Azam Khan, who played the main role in making the agreement between Mulayam and Akhilesh, said that for the last time, he will try for a compromise between the two
 haalanki wo pichley 24 ghante se donon khemon se baatcheet kar rahe hai, lekin abhi tak unhen kamyaabi nahin mili he
 The Mulayam Election Commission met with the Election Commission informed Mulayam Singh Yadav about the latest political developments in the party
 sutron ke mutabik mulaayam ne ayog ko bataaya ki duusare kheme kii raajnneetik kaarywahi party samvidhan ke khilaaf he or jo ramgopal ne adhiveshan bulaayaa wo asanvaidhanik he, kyonki ramgopal or akhilesh yadav ko pehle hi party se nikaala ja chukaa he
 In front of the commission, Mulayam also asserted his right to the 'cycle' election symbol
 vahiin ramgopal yadav mangalvaar subah saadhe 11 baje chunaav ayog pahunchenge
 Before Akhilesh camp was also active, Akhilesh Yadav has given information about forming a new faction to the Election Commission, after which mulayam-shivpal faction is also putting his side in the Election Commission that he has right over Samajwadi Party and Cycle Symbol
 mulaayam gut kaa maananaa he ki chunaav ayog main unka paksh zyada majboot he, kyonki jo akhilesh yadav ne adhiveshan bulaayaa tha, usamen beshak akhilesh yadav ko rashtriya adhyaksh banane kaa prastaav paas kar diya gaya ho
 But the resolution to remove Mulayam Singh from the national president was not passed
 aise main akhilesh yadav ko rashtriya adhyaksh banane kaa prastaav kaise paarit ho saktaa he
 Technically, this is wrong, we will keep this aspect in the Election Commission
 mulaayam gut kaa maananaa he ki isi vajah se mulaayam singh aaj bhi party ke rashtriya adhyaksh he
 Meanwhile, Mulayam Singh Yadav has postponed the January 5 session

 In the ongoing controversy about the 'akhilesh himself big brand' party symbol, Akhilesh's supporter MLC Udayveer Singh said that we will contest in the name of Akhilesh
 udaiveer ne kaha ki akhilesh khud main brands hai
 Udayveer, however, hoped that Netaji would agree to be persuaded
 mere saath netaji ke bhi naare lagaayenis bich mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav bhi apane kareebi vidhayakon or netaaon ke saath mulaakaat kii
 In the meeting, he asked them to prepare for the election
 akhilesh ne kaha ki ham or netaji ek hi hai
 If you raise our slogans, then do theirs too
 aap log unase bhi milen
 Akhilesh will meet the workers once again on Tuesday
 main puri tarah se fitdilli ke liye ravaanaa hone se pehle mulaayam ne kaha ki main puri tarah se feet hum
 The media has always supported me, i have not done any corruption or wrongdoing
 aarope laga to supreme court ne mujhe bari kar diya
 He said that the Samajwadi Party is mine and its election symbol is also mine
 EC main jane par ye sab ho saktaa he
 
 
 There is a set procedure in the Election Commission, the Commission will see how many members of the executive or MLA, MP and party candidates are with whom

 america raashtrapati donald trump ke aaropon ke baad pakistan ne america ke saath military or khufia sahyog ko sthagit kar diya he
 This was informed by Pakistan's Defense Minister Khurram Dastagir Khan while addressing the program of Institute of Strategic Studies in Islamabad on Tuesday
 bataa den ki janvari ke pehle hafte main twit kar trump ne pakistan par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 He said that despite huge help to Pakistan as security assistance, America has got nothing but deception and lies
 'pakistan kii security invoyrement kaa dhaancha' sheershak ke seminar ko sambodhit karte hue khan ne kaha ki america kii afghanistan main haar hone ja rahi he bajaay iske ki usne karodon dollar kharch kiye hai
 He alleged that the US is making Pakistan a scapegoat for its defeat in Afghanistan
 khurram khan ne kaha, 'pakistan apane tyaag kii koi keemat nahin lagaana chahta, lekin ham chaahate hai ki use pahachaanaa jaae
 He further said that Pakistan will not allow that the battle of Afghanistan be fought on the land of Pakistan
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki america pakistan par aarope lagane main vyast he, bajaay iske ki pakistan-afghanistan border ko surakshit banane ke liye madad uplabdh karai jaae
 The US Embassy in Islamabad has said that it has not received information from Pakistan about the postponement of the military co-operation
 don kii report ke mutabik america duutavas ke pravaktaa richard neljair ne kaha, 'hamen koi aupchaarik jaankaree nahin mili he
 In response to a question, Dastagir Khan said that Pakistan had taken appropriate steps by stopping NATO supplies to Afghanistan after the 2011 attack on Salala check post
 haalanki unhone spasht kiya ki trump ke kathith aaropon ke baad pakistan is tarah kaa koi kadam nahin uthayega, balki sahi samay kaa intjaar karegaa
 The Pakistani Defense Minister said that countries like Iran, China and Russia are important allies for the region like the US
 bataa den ki khan kaa yah bayaan pakistan ke videsh mantri khwaja asif ke us bayaan par muhar lagaana hi he ,jisamen unhone ishaara kiya tha ki america ke saath pakistan ke dwipaksheeya sambandhon kaa samay puraa ho gaya he
 Earlier this week, Asif said in an interview to Wall Street General that allied countries do not behave this way
 unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki afghanistan main apni asafalataaon ke liye washington, islamabad ko bali kaa bakra bana rahaa he
 The Pentagon said on Monday that Washington had told Pakistan what Islamabad would have to do to get security assistance of millions of dollars
 pentagon ke pravaktaa karnal rob manning ne kaha tha ki pakistan se hamaari ummiden saaf or spasht hai
 The Taliban, Haqqani leaders and those planning an attack should not find refuge on Pakistan's land
 pakistan-america ke kharaab hote rishtebta den ki nae saal ke maukey par washington ne islamabad par dabaav badhaate hue aatankwaad ke khilaaf or zyada kade kadam uthaane ko kaha he
 Washington has made it clear that withholding security aid to Pakistan following Trump's allegations of 'lies and deception' is an important part of America's South Asia strategy
 america ke is kadam ko pakistan main islamabad ke upar kade aarthik pratibandh lagaae jane ke shuruaati kadamon ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 However, despite the tension between the two countries, there remains a liaison between the US and Pakistan authorities
 america ke dephence secretary james mattis ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki sainya sahaayta sthagit kiye jane ke baavjood pentagon pakistani sainya pratishthanon ke saath apana communication banaae hue hai
 On the other hand, Pakistan Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua said that Islamabad will maintain contact with Washington as much as possible
 kyonki america sirf global power hi nahin he, balki kshetra main uski maujuudagi bhi he
 And for Pakistan he is like a neighbor

 com / eoog1tyxzv Just before the elections, the hearts of friends-turned-enemies Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party are beginning to meet once again
 bijepi or shivasena donon kii ore se narmi ke sanket hai
 It is different that now the atmosphere is different, the situation is different
 chunaav ke baad shivasena ko uski jagah saaf-saaf dikhaai dene lagi he
 Perhaps this is the reason Uddhav Thackeray has sent two of his messengers to Delhi Durbar for talks
 shivasena ne maanga dipti CM kaa padbijapi aalaakaman se aagaamee sarkaar par baatcheet karne ke liye shivasena ne anil desai or subhash desai ko kaman saunpi he
 These two leaders will meet Rajnath Singh and JP Nadda
 mana ja rahaa he ki is baatcheet main sarkaar main shivasena kii sthiti par baatcheet hogi
 It is believed that in view of this meeting, Home Minister Rajnath Singh has canceled his visit to Mumbai
 rajnath singh ne mangalvaar din main hi saaf kar diya tha ki kendriya paryvekshakon kii maujuudagi main jo baithak mangalvaar ko hone vaali thi wo ab deepawali ke baad hogi
 There are obviously signs of softening from both sides
 haalanki sutara ye bataate hai ki shivasena chaahati he ki sarkaar 1995 ke gathbandhan ke us formule par hi bane
 According to this formula, it was decided to become the Chief Minister of the larger party and the Deputy Chief Minister of the smaller party
 saath hi grih, vitt, sinchai, peedbludi or gramin vikaas jaise mantralay bhi shivasena ke khate main aane kii baat thi
 But Om Mathur has given an indication of how much Shiv Sena will be considered in the present situation
 unhone kaha tha, '1995 kaa formula diya gaya tha to naa ham the naa uddhav the
 The sensible takes care of the present situation
 'baatcheet to shivasena ke saath shuru hone ja rahi he lekin bijepi ke rukh se sanket saaf die ja rahe hai ki ab unhen shivasena kii itani jarurat nahin, jitani shivasena ko unki he
 It is clear that in this equation of politics, if the Shiv Sena wants to participate in the power of Maharashtra, then it will have to bow its head and accept the BJP
 jammu-kashmir ke keran sector main elosi ke paas pakistan kii ore se kii gai firing main sena ke do jawan shahid ho gaye hai

 Films are the source of human fantasy

 But there is no fixed formula for the success of films
 har daur main yuva varg filmkaaron kii pehali pasand rahaa he
 Also, women and elders had a big hand in the success of the recent Baghban film in making films
 aaj ke kuch yuva filmkaar yuvaaon ko aakarshith karne ke liye kahani yaa vishay kaa chayan kar filmein bana rahe hai
 By youth, they mean people between the ages of 18 and 32
 eudli films or crorj antertenment khaastaur se aisi filmein banane main jute hai jo yuvaaon ko apil kar saken

 All other films have their star theme, it can be said
 toilet-ek premakatha kii nirmaataa prerana aroda kahati hai, ''ab hindi cinema badal rahaa he
 The audience cannot be seduced by the clichéd story
 film main kuch nayaapan ho, script tite ho, hamen darshakon kii pasand kaa khyaal rakhte hue filmein banani padegi
 "agreeing with the inspiration, Siddharth Kumar Anand, vice president of Saregama India and head of youdaily Films also says," The charisma shown by small-budget films at the box office shows that the film has a hero script and We will have to work seriously on that
 "script ko hero maanane vaale filmkaar ab khaas darshakon kii taraf mudiye lage hai
 There are some film production companies that are focusing on making films for a certain age audience by doing research
 prerana ne bataaya, ''main apni company crorj antertenment ke binar tale aisi filmein bana rahi hum, jo khaskar yuvaaon ko aakarshith karengi
 My inclination towards youth is also because i am young
 maine 27 saal kii umr main industry main kadam rakhaa he or pehle hi saal main maine rustam or toilet-ek prem katha jaisi safal filmein di hai
 From these two films we have spent around 300 crores
 se zyada kaa bijness kiya he
 It is true that both my films have big stars like Akshay, but if we look carefully, the real star of both films is the script itself
 rustam ke liye vipul ke
 Rawal and garima-siddharth have written excellent scripts for toilet-ek Prem Katha
 akshay to bikaoo cheharaa hai hi
 Also, we got a big support in marketing from them
 " udhar saaregama india ke managing diarector vikram mehara kehete hai, ''hamane research ke baad tay kiya he ki eudli films ke binar tale 18 se 32 saal kii umr ke logon ke liye filmein banani hai
 Our first priority in these films is script
 is saal jo kam bajet vaali filmein bani hai, ham usase bhi kam bajet main filmein bana rahe hai
 There are no stars in our films
 hamane jis age group ko torget kiya he, uske darshakon ko hamaari filmein pasand aaengi
 "prerna's business partner Arjun N
 kapur bhi yuva hai or unka puraa focus script par rahata he
 These two youngsters are creating a stir in Bollywood
 prerana kahati hai, ''ham pakke bijnesaman hai
 Therefore, the films in which you are investing money, want to earn before its release
 rustam ke nirmaan se pehle hamane shodh karaayaa tha ki isaki kahani or iske court cese ke bare main logon kii kitni dilchaspee he
 John Abraham was supposed to do the film earlier, but after his refusal, we made a film with Akshay Kumar
 isaki safalataa or akshay kii pancchuality ne hamen toilet-ek prem katha banane ke liye majaboor kar diya
 "here Siddharth, the head of Udli also says," Now is the time to make films on a low budget
 story ko hero rakhen or bade star jaruri nahin hai, balki jaruri yah he ki film main jo kalakaar kaam kar rahe hai, unhen acting aani chahie
 "saregama India MD Vikram admits," The script lags behind due to the big star
 lekin agar kahani main dam he to ham log khatra uthaane ko taiyaar hai
 "I come from a small town," says Prerna, a resident of Dehradun
 so aam logon kii samasyaon se waakif hum, par cinema main us par koi focus nahin hota
 We raised the toilet problem
 darasal mere paas desi dimag he or main usee kaa istemaal apane film vyavsaay main kar rahi hum
 We choose the script carefully
 isamen aaj ke samaaj ke log or unki samasyaon ko dekhte hai
 The hero of my upcoming film Roshni is Shahid Kapoor
 isamen bijli kii samasya ko uthaaya gaya he
 We have also written the script with agarima-siddharth, who wrote toilet-ek Prem Katha
 iskaa nirdesan shrinarayan singh karenge jo rustam ke editor the
 We are also spending money on scripts

 But now we are making small budget films under the banner of Uddli Films
 jis tarah se ham gaanon kii roylty dete hai, usee tarah se ham filmon kii roylty denge
 We have fixed our film production rules and budget
 hamen filmon main hero kaa romance nahin dikhaanaa he
 Today's young audience wants a story, not a star
 ham 18 se 32 ke age group ke liye film bana rahe hai
 Today's youth needs a story that they can relate to themselves
 isliye hamane script chunane ke liye bhi 18 se 32 saal kii umr ke saat-aath yuvaaon kii team banaai he jisamen har dharm ke yuva shaamil hai
 Its leader is the famous script writer Anjum Rajbali (drohkal, The Legend of Bhagat Singh, Politics Fame)
 " eudli films ke pramukh siddharth ne bataaya, ''hamaari script team ek saal main 700 script pard chuki he lekin sirf 15 script hi chuni gai hai or un par filmein ban rahi hai
 We are making films in every language

 prerana kaa filmon se pyaar dekhakar unke pita ne khet bechakar paise die jisase unhone apana film nirmaan kaa vyavsaay shuru kiya he
 "I too have seen discrimination between son and daughter in my home," says Prerna
 ham do bahanen hai
 i don't have any brother isliye main aisa kaam kar rahi hum jisase mere ghar waalon ko lage ki beti, bete se kam nahin he
 My film business is in partnership
 mere saath akshay, jon ke alaava anoushka sharma partnership main filmein bana rahe hai
 Anushka is making the film Pari
 yah bhi yuvaaon ke liye hi he or isamen jo kahani he, vah pehle filmon main dekhi nahin gai he
 If this film was liked by the audience, then the trend of horror films will start once again
 sushant singh rajput or sara ali khan abhinit film kedarnath bhi youth oriented he
 "prerna revealed that she is making two more films with Akshay
 jon ke saath ek thriller film he to vishaal bharadwaj ke saath kamedi drama ban rahi he jisamen kriti sinan or navazuddin siddiki mukhya bhoomika main hai
 Apart from this, the film about Irrfan Khan and Deepika Padukone is being directed by casting director Honey Trehan
 vikram mehara bataate hai, ''eudli films ke binar vaali filmon kaa vishay kaaphi alag he
 On one hand, the film has the story of an eight-year-old child whose father has been kidnapped by the terrorists and they find him

 There is a Tamil film which tells the story of a couple who are husband and wife according to the society, but later it is revealed that they are siblings

 It has the story of bringing justice to a nine-year-old girl victim of rape

 Union Minister Rajyavardhan Rathore, who gave a fitness challenge to the public by putting a video of pushups in the office, has revealed on the platform of Panchayat Aaj Tak where the idea came from him
 kendriya soochna evam prasaaran mantri or yuva maamle evam khel rajya mantri swatantra prabhaar rajyavardhan singh rathod nepanchayat ajtakake manch par kaha ki aaj desh main 30 se 40 saal ke log bhi heart atake, depressant jaisi beemaari se jujh rahe hai
 Stress is increasing in people's lives
 hamaare piem narendra modi bhi lagaataar swasth rahane kii baat karte hai
 That is why we thought why not combine exercise with work
 puddp vaala video planning ke tahat tha yaa phir baithe-baithe video kaa khyaal aayaa? is par rathod ne kaha ki mujhe laga ki kyon na yuva desh ko chunauti di jaae
 The Sports Ministry said that only preparing for Olympics is not the job of the Sports Ministry
 hamaari praathamikta desh ko swasth rakhana he
 It is not just the work of the Ministry of Health

 We are first trying to make the foundation of the country's health good
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main rathod ne kaha ki mujhase pehle abhi tak jitne bhi khel mantri rahe hai, ve ye sochate honge ki ye kya khel mantralay de diya
 It does not take much work
 taqatvar mantralay miltaa to zyada acha hota
 But i do not believe that at all
 hamaare pradhanmantri khud sehat ko lekar bahut phikrmand hai
 They focus directly on our work
 rajyavardhan rathod ne kaha ki kendra sarkaar deshbhar main 8 se 12 saal ke bacchon kaa test karte hue unke khelkud main jane ke raste ko jaanane kii koshish karegi
 Rathore said that under this scheme we will shortlist about 20,000 children across the country, testing about 1 crore children and decide which children can be better for which sport
 iske baad jin bacchon ko khel main bhavishya bananaa he, unke liye kendra sarkaar se scolership kaa praavdhaan kiya jayega
 On the issue of Fake News, Rajyavardhan Singh said that social media is a huge force and that strength needs to be preserved
 yadi kisi soochna kaa satyaapan nahin kiya jayega to phek news kaa maamla saamne aata rahegaa
 For this, not only social media but newsrooms also need to be more alert
 desh kii janata ko bhi media kii in khaamiyon ko dekhte hue kisi bhi khabar kaa pehle nijee taur par satyaapan karne kii jarurat he

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special newzlator In Chhattisgarh, more than one million tribals have lost sleep due to a central government order
 sarkari circular ne jangal ke bheetar rahane vaale sabhi rahavaasiyon ke sabhi adhikaron ko nilambit kar diya he
 Especially those families which are located around Tiger Reserve Century and National Park
 rashtriya baagh sangrakshan praadhikaran circular se chhattisgarh ke lagbhag 300 gaanv main logon ke jivan yaapan par prashn chinh lag gaya he
 Actually, due to this circular neither villagers will be able to do farming in the forests nor will they be able to live there
 kul milakar saikadon saalon se jangal ke bheetar based rahavaasiyon ko bedakhal karne ke liye ye circular kaaphi he
 This is the circular that has taken away the happiness of a large population inhabited within the forest in Chhattisgarh
 is circular main vanavaasiyon ko jangal se khadedane kaa rasta saaf kar diya gaya he
 The circular clearly states that all rights of tribals and other people living in tiger reserve areas have been suspended
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki in ilaakon main based logon ko koi bhi adhikaar naa diya jaaen
 This circular has been issued by the National Tiger Conservation Authority NTCA
 chhattisgarh kaa van vibhaag iske kriyanvayan main juta he
 Not only Chhattisgarh, the authority has issued this circular to 17 states of the country
 uske is circular ke jari hone kii khabar jangal main aag kii tarah fail gai he
 Actually Chhattisgarh has a large population of forest dwellers
 ye log jal jangal or jameen se pustaini rup se jude hue he
 Their entire livelihood depends on the forest itself
 masalan kheti baadi se lekar rojgaar ke liye ye rahvaasee jangalon par ashrith rahate hai
 Chhattisgarh has four tiger reserves, 11 wild life centuries and two national parks
 inke bheetar lagbhag teen sau vanagram hai
 a population of about one million lives here
 wo bhi das bees saalon se nahin balki sainkadon saalon se peedi dar peedi ye log jangalon ke bheetar hi rahete aa rahe hai
 Small forest produce and cultivation originating from the forest is also their source of income and part of living
 aise main ye circular in par baari pad rahaa he
 On the other hand, the Forest Department argues that this circular has been issued on the basis of Section 38 of the Wildlife Conservation Act 1972
 iske lagu karne se vanyajeevon ko laabh milegaa
 Hunting incidents will stop and wildlife conservation will accelerate
 duusari ore is circular ke jari hone ke baad van adhikaar kanoon FRA 2006 par bhi sawalia nishaan lag gaya he
 Because the FRA empowers villagers living in the forest to maintain traditional livelihoods by using crop and forest resources
 isi kanoon ke tahat vanavaasi rajya sarkaar se apane gharon ke patte maang rahe hai
 According to NTCA figures, there are 46 tigers in Chhattisgarh
 inamen sarvaadhik 28 baagh bilaspur sthit achaanakmaar tiger rigerv centuri main hai
 However, a month ago, Chhattisgarh High Court did not declare these figures of NTCA as practical
 hoicourt ne ek yachika kii sunwaayee karte hue kaha tha ki is tiger rigerv centuri main 28 baagh hote to ve jarur dikhte
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, political turmoil has intensified in Bihar
