'care retings' ke mukhya arthshaastri madan sabanvis kaa sawaal tha, ''yah skim maujuuda skiimon se kitni zyada prabhaavshaalee he? kya isse emsamai kshetra ko zyada rin mil sakegaa? nai ghoshnaa or maujuuda nitiyon main antar bahut maamuli he
 The MSME package includes freedom from harassment from government inspectors, loans through the GST portal for registered undertakings, higher interest concessions on loans (5 per cent as against the existing 3 per cent) and compulsory purchases from a woman-run MSME for public sector undertakings
 (up to 3% of total purchases)
 takreeban 12 karod logon ko rojgaar dene vaale or kareeb 6
 All these steps should have been seen as a ray of hope for the MSME sector with a population of 5 crore
 november 2016 main notebandi or phir kuch hi maheene baad jiesti ko lagu kar die jane se is kshetra ke paas kaaryshil puunji kii khaasi tangi ho gai thi
 Then when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) tightened the standards for repayment of bad debts, then the loan became even more difficult
 bhartiya laghu, chote or madhyam udhyam parisangh ke mahasachiv anil bharadwaj kaa kahana tha, 'yah ek gas chembar main hone sareekha he
 Prior to Urjit Patel taking over as the Reserve Bank, msmes were working with the central bank to provide them with the same options for restructuring loans as big businesses get
 do saal guzarane ke baad, emsamai ke liye dhandha karnaa to aasaan hua he lekin kaaryshil puunji ko lekar unki pareshaaniyon kaa koi samaadhaan najar nahin aa rahaa he
 In less than an hour, there is a lot of skepticism among people about the promise of sanctioning loans up to Rs 1 crore online
 bharadwaj kehete hai, 'yah itnaa aasaan bhi nahin hoga
 It will have many conditions
 rin kii manjuuri mil jane or uskaa vitaran ho jane ke darmyaan kaaphi antar he
 '500 crore in total

 This will be quite encouraging for msmes as smaller vendors will be able to access the lenders' funds on the basis of the amount payable to them
 emsamai se aapurti lene vaale vyavsaay agar bhugtan main 45 din se zyada kii deree karte hai to unhen iskaa byoraa company register ko dena hota he
 In addition, the mandate for procurement from msmes for state-owned companies has also been increased from the earlier 20 per cent to 25 per cent

 In the hearing of the Ayodhya dispute, the Supreme Court today cleared a big hurdle
 supreme court ne kah diya he ki masjid main namaaj islam main jaruri nahin
 That is, on this basis the claim was rejected today
 supreme court ne 1994 ke ismail faruki cese kaa purana faisla barkaraar rakhaa he or ab is maamle ke teji se niptaare kii ummid majboot ho gai he
 On this decision of the Supreme Court, AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi said that it would have been good if the decision had been referred to the constitutional bench
 islam main masjid ek jaruri hissaa he
 This is mentioned in the Quran and Hadith
 afsos is baat kaa he ki jab teen talaak kaa masalaa aayaa to quran kaa zikr kiya gaya or jab masjid kaa masalaa aayaa to quran ko bhul ja rahe hai
 Owaisi said that religious places of other religions are not necessary? He questioned how the court could decide what was necessary
 yah tay karne kaa adhikaar dharmik guruon ko he
 According to the VHP and the RSS can not run
 unhone aresas par tanj karte hue kaha ki aap apni shakha main rahen or tay karen ki mandir kab or kahaan bananaa chahie
 This country operates according to the constitution and not on the basis of a person's religious sentiments
 iske alaava ovaisi ne ajtak ke khaas kaarykramhallabolmen kaha ki supreme court ke kehane ke baavjood bijepi ke netaa yah samaj nahin kar paa rahe hai ki yah cese tital suut kaa he na ki aasthaa kaa
 He said in a debate with BJP leader Sudhanshu Trivedi that the BJP government says something else in the court, something in the TV debate and something else in the run-up to the elections
 ovaisi ne kaha ki bijepi netaa ayodhya par bahes main jo daleel dete hai vah unhen atorni general ke jariye supreme court main deni chahie, lekin ve aisa nahin karenge, kyonki unhen pataa he ki court aisi baton ko tavajjo nahin detaa he
 The Supreme Court marginalized the religious need for namaz in the mosque and there was hope for the Ram temple in Ayodhya
 mandir samarthakon ko lagane laga he ki ab wo din dur nahin jab desh kii sabase badi adaalat se vivaadit jameen par malikana haq kii jang bhi wo jeet lenge
 For BJP, this is a decided decision
 ram mandir kaa masalaa raajnneeti ke kathghare main dashakon se khada he
 If the ball is in the court's court, then even the Modi government is hesitant to burn hands in this furnace of controversy
 court kaa faisla modi sarkaar ke liye har tarah se mufeed hoga
 If you win, BJP will be considered as a win and if you lose, then the way will be open to face the decision of the court
 supreme court ne taarikh bhi tay kar di he
 a hearing will be held in the case of land ownership from October 29
 sanket bataa rahe hai ki desh kii sabase chhadi adaalat bhi ayodhya vivaad ko jald nipataane ke mood main he
 The country stands on the electoral threshold of 2019 and before that any decision on Ayodhya will not be less than any earthquake
 kya he ismail faruki cese?ayodhya main karsevakon ne 6 disambar, 1992 ko babari masjid gira di thi
 After this, on January 7, 1993, the Central Government, by bringing an ordinance, acquired 67 acres of land in Ayodhya
 iske tahat vivaadit jameen kaa 120x80 feet hissaa bhi adhigrahit kar liya gaya tha jise babari masjid-ram janmabhumi parisar kaha jaataa he
 Ismail Farooqui challenged this decision of the central government in the Supreme Court in his petition and said how the government can acquire the religious site
 is par sunwaayee karte hue sheersh adaalat ne kaha tha ki masjid main namaaj padhanaa islam kaa anivaary hissaa nahin he

 The police are now interrogating the gang members, which of the incidents they have carried out
 police ne bataaya ki giroh kaa sargana anna naam kaa shaks he, jis par darjanon aapraadhik maamle darj hai
 Seeing Bittu, a disabled member of the gang, one can feel pity in anyone's mind, but this is the most dangerous person in the gang
 police ne bataaya ki akele bittu par hi saikadon aapraadhik maamle darj hai
 Police said that members of this gang used to travel in the car on the highway like any family and would mark the victim and offer him a lift
 car menmahila jahaan aage kii seat parabaiti hoti, vahiin peeche kii seat par ek divyang vyakti ko dekhakar koi bhi inke jhaanse main aa jaataa

 grand trunk road se sate amritsar antarrashtriya bas adde par bason kii awajahi or musafiron kii bheed aapako apni yatra se itar kuch dekhne-sunne kaa mauka nahin detii he
 Between the journey there is a journey going on inside you
 musafiron kii railempel main amritsar ke antarrashtriya bas adde par hokar bhi aap shaayad vahaan nahin hote hai
 Because you are traveling, but if you stop a little in the middle and inquire about the building of the bus base, then it was a surprise to know about it
 hairaani kii vajah yah thi ki jis jagah se aane-jane ke liye basen pakadi ja rahi hai, vah darasal bas adde kii imaarat nahin balki yuvaaon ke liye bana hua youth hostel he jise rajya sarkaar ne bas adde main tabdeel kar diya he
 The occupation after a certain period of agreement is called an encroachment in the official language
 darasal, khelon ke lieyuvaonko protsaahit karne ke makasad se deshbhar main banaae gaye kai youth hostel atikaraman kaa shikaar ho gaye hai
 There are some cases of encroachment of State Governments which are surprising to know about
 lekin yah sach he
 Surprising because the campaign to build youth hostels arrived in India from Europe, but here the hostels fell victim to encroachment
 inaki badahaali kii tasviir yah he ki kahin youth hostel patte par enjio ko supurd kar die gaye hai to kahin use bas adde main tabdeel kar diya gaya he
 Before seeing their plight, it is necessary to turn the pages of its history so that it can be known how futile the struggle has been for these hostels designed to create and weave the youth
 sangharsh kii yatragermany ke ek shikshak richard shirarmaan ne pehali baar yuvaaon ke liye vishesh chatravaas sthapit karne kii muhim shuru kii thi
 He himself established a youth hostel in Altenia, Germany, in 1912 itself, where he encouraged his school children to go for trekking
 unki is muhim kaa asar rahaa ki 1919 germany main youth hostel association kaa gathan ho gaya
 Richard Shirraman's campaign continued, and as a result, the Youth Hostel Federation Conference was held at the opening of the International Youth Hostel Federation in Amsterdam in 1932, and with this began the trend to establish youth hostels in Europe
 bharat bhi isse achoota nahin rahaa
 Before the partition of india-pakistan in 1947, the idea of youth hostel had knocked over this continent
 punjab cirkil ke byaaj scouts and girls gides of india ne yuva chatravaas ke liye prastaav rakhaa
 On 9 June 1945, the first Youth Hostel of undivided India was established at Tara Devi near Shimla
 iskaa udghaatan punjab ke tatkaaleen governor sar bartrand glenci ne kiya tha
 India later became a member of the International Youth Federation and in 1956 the Youth Hostels Association of India was established
 iske kaaryon se prabhavit hokar tatkaaleen pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru ne isaki tarif kii thi
 Youth hostels were also established in several states of India in Dakhkabad in India
 in chatravaason kaa makasad yuvaaon ko sanvaarane or unhen desh ke samrudh saanskrithik viraasat se parichit karana tha
 Both the central and state governments are partners in their construction
 centre sarkaar jahaan inke nirmaan kaa kharch uthaati he, vahiin rajya sarkarein jameen uplabdh karaane ke saath pani, bijli kii aapurti or sadak nirmaan kaa kaary dekhati hai
 The encroachment of the State Governments was as beautiful as the motive for constructing these youth hostels in India, now their management has deteriorated
 yah kisi or ke nahin, balki sarkaar ke atikaraman kaa shikaar ho gaye hai
 According to the Standing Committee on Human Resource Development Affairs of the Rajya Sabha, the State Governments have encroached upon the youth hostels and are using them for their own benefit
 8 march 2018 ko sansad main pesh kii gai report main sthaayee samiti ne kaha he ki haryana ke yamunagar or rewadi ke youth hostalon kaa inke liye tay uddeshyon ke khilaaf istemaal kiya ja rahaa he

 The Youth Hostel in Amritsar has been taken over by the State Transport Department, while it was allowed to be used only as an interstate bus terminal in november-december 2005
 haalanki, is par kabiz parivahan vibhaag ne tab se na to kiraaya chukaaya chukaa rahaa he, na hi ise khaali kar rahaa he
 There is also a youth hostel in Darjeeling, West Bengal, but it is being used for refugees
 iske alaava sikkim ke gangtok ke youth hostel main vishvavidhyalay chal rahaa he
 Similarly, the Youth Hostel of Dimapur in Nagaland was leased to an NGO
 philhal yahaan se ek nijee vishvavidhyalay global open uniwarsity kaa sanchaalan ho rahaa he
 The youth hostel of Guwahati is in the possession of the Sports Department
 ise vibhaag ke daftar or afasaron ke liye awaas main tabdeel kar diya gaya he
 In view of the encroachment on youth hostels (recently), the Secretary of the Ministry of Youth Affairs of the Central Government has written a letter to the concerned State Governments and asked to remove the encroachment
 haalanki, punjab jaise rajyon main youth hostel par atikaraman ke itihaas ko dekhte hue lagata nahin he ki inhen itani jaldi mukti milane vaali he
 Kapil Mishra, who was a partner of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, accused him of corruption
 jiske baad arvind kejariwal sabhi raajnneetik partiyon ke nishane par hai
 So the entire Aam Aadmi Party has come to the rescue of Kejriwal, and is fiercely attacking Kapil Mishra
 aap netaa sanjay singh ne kapil mishra par bijepi kii bhashaa bolne kaa aarope lagaaya, to vahiin kapil ne kaha ki jab bhi koi inke khilaaf bolta he to use modi or bijepi kaa agent bataate hai

 daawa kiya gaya ki hamale ke vakt bagdadi apane kuch saathiyon ke saath iraq or syria border ke najadik ek gumnaam thikaane par ja rahaa tha
 While Baghdadi was injured in this air raid on a ISIS convoy, three of his companions were killed, but within a month the news of this third death of Baghdadi also came out false
 chauthi maut: 9 june 20169 june 2016 kii shaam ko america kii aguai vaali gathjod sena ko khabar milti he ki iesas kaa sargana abu bakar al bagdadi kuch duusare bade cmanderon ke saath kaaron ke ek kafile main chup kar syria se rakka ja rahaa he

 Fifth death: 11 June 2017 Syrian state television claimed Baghdadi was killed in a June 11 airstrike in the city of Raqqa, Syria
 iske saath hi russian army ne kaha tha ki 28 may ko usne syria main aies ke majboot garh rakka main hawaii hamalaa kiya tha

 Saying that the vote of confidence in the Assembly yesterday was 'not in accordance with the law'
 rajyapal ne mukhyamantri ko patr bhejkar aaj kaha ki vah bahumat sabit nahin kar paae
 The Governor on Monday recommended imposition of President's rule in the state on the grounds that the confidence vote reached in the House was 'unconstitutional'
 mana jaataa he ki rajyapal ne mukhyamantri se apane patr main yah kaha he ki vah unhen 14 aktubar ko bahumat sabit karne ke liye ek or mauka dene ko taiyaar hai

 Speaking to reporters, Mayawati said, "I want to clarify that in the coming Lok Sabha elections, our party will not contest elections by compromising with any party across the country
" hamaari party puri taiyaari se akele chunaav ladegi
 He said, rumors are being spread that we may have an internal or external alliance with Congress or BJP
 ye keval hawaii baaten hai, jo sochi-samajhi sajeesh ke tahat failaai ja rahi hai
 Its purpose is to harm the BSP by misleading our people
 basapa pramukh ne kaha ki unki party aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main kaaphi acha pradarshan karegi or uttar pradesh main vah pehle number par rahakar saamaajik parivartan ke mishan main ahm bhoomika nibhaayegi
 Mayawati said, to achieve our objective, we will also get a lot of help from bjp's Advani, Modi and Rajnath trio, which are engaged in cutting each other inside
 mayawati ne kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav se pehle basapa dilli, rajasthan, madhya pradesh or rajasthan main apane balboote par chunaav lard rahi he
 In this election, the BSP is trying to emerge as a trump of power, so that it can put pressure on the governments there to formulate the right policy for the poor and the oppressed
 basapa pramukh ne kaha ki is makasad main kaamyaab hone ke liye hi vah jald hi in chaaron rajyon kaa daura karengi
 He said that the SP government of Uttar Pradesh completely failed on the law and order and governance front, is rioting with the connivance of BJP to fulfill its interests
 mayawati ne kaha, loksabhaa chunaav kaa samay jaise-jaise najadik aata jayega, vaise-vaise sapa or bhaajapa kii andruni mileebhagat se ek-duusare ko chunavi laabh pahunchane ke liye yahaan sampradayikta kaa jehar failaakar voton kaa dhruvikaran karne ke liye yahaan kaa maahaul kharaab kiya jayega
 The public needs to be very vigilant
 aisi sthiti main main aaj phir rajyapal se uttar pradesh main raashtrapati shashan lagu karne kii sifarish kaa anurodh karti hum
 Describing the Rath Yatras being carried out by the SP for inclusion of 17 backward castes in the Scheduled Castes as 'deceit and dramatization', he said that before taking such trips, the SP government should apologize to the OBC society for that crime, Which he did by issuing a mandate in the previous government by depriving the backward of reservations
 basapa pramukh ne kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav se pehle desh main aisa maahaul banane kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he ki congress or bhaajapa ke sivaay or koi party he hi nahin
 The truth is that today both Congress and BJP are not the first choice of the countrymen

 It added, "inhuman incidents are happening in Rakhine province of Myanmar

 The Government of India helped the Rohingya refugees living in Bangladesh under 'operation Insaniyat'

 This letter states that at a time when these states are burning in the fire of violence, more and quicker steps need to be taken to suppress the wave of violence

 The letter said on behalf of all intellectuals, we expect the Government of India to come up with a global power perspective on the Rohingya crisis
 rohingya musalamaanon ko unke desh waapas bhejne kaa kadam naa keval bharat ke maanavtaavaadi siddhanton or paramparaon ke khilaaf hoga balki antarrashtriya kanoon ke prati bharat kii patibaddhta kaa bhi ulanghan hoga
 It also said that of course Rohingya Muslims have the right to return home safely and with dignity, but in the present situation it would not be right to return to their country
 myanmar main jab tak hatyaon, lutpaat or hinsa kaa daur jari he tab tak antarrashtriya kanoon unhen bharat main rahane kaa adhikaar detaa he
 Many civil society members and even the High Commissioner of the United Nations Human Rights Commission have appealed to India not to force Rohingya refugees to return to their country

 -input bhashaa The Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association (MPCA) election to be held in August is a cocktail of politics and cricket
 yah match indore banaam gwalior ke netaaon ke bich hoga jisamen indore team ke captain hai rajya ke udyog mantri kailash vijayawargeey or gwalior team ke captain hai kendriya vaanijya rajyamantri jyotiraditya sindhiya
 Scindia and Vijay Divargiya, president of Indore Divisional Cricket Organization, are face to face for the second time for the post of MPCA President
 2010 main sindhiya ne vijayawargeey ko lagbhag 70 voton se haraaya tha
 Earlier, Scindia had the undisputed support of the association's 240 members
 lekin jab se vijayawargeey ne unke khilaaf morcha sambhala tab se association main aarope-pratyarope shuru ho gaye
 The Vijayvargiya camp has alleged that the MPCA prefers Gwalior rather than Indore and the reason for this is Scindia's Gwalior love
 empisie ke sadsy or vijayawargeey ke nijee sachiv manish shrivastav kehete hai, ''indore main match yojit karne vaala empisie match se hone vaala laabh sabhi aath divijanon main baantta he jabaki gwalior main match karwaane vaala gwalior diviginal cricket 86 pratishat labhaansh khud letaa he
 "they ask if 29 acres of land was purchased in Gwalior for infrastructure, then why was there no such effort for Indore? MPCA Secretary Narendra Menon retorted, saying," Land for Indore itself is Vijayvargiya's minister
 Could not get it despite gwalior ko zyada labhaansh isliye diya jaataa he kyonki stadium ke rakrakhaav kaa kharch vahi vahan karata he

 empisie ke chunaav main andruni raajnneetik sameekaran kaaphi dilachasp he
 Scindia's strong fielding is frozen on this electoral ground and some BJP players may support Scindia, which could be a problem for Vijayvargiya

 Recently, he invited Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan at an event of Indore Divisional Cricket Association, where Chauhan tied his bridges to praise him

 Another witness speaking against Asaram Bapu was shot and killed
 kripal singh kii maut is maamle main pehali nahin balki teesri maut he, lekin hairaani kii baat ye he ki aakhir koun asaram baapu par chale rahe yon shoshan maamle ke ahm gavaahon ko ek-ek kar maut ke ghat utaar rahaa he
 The police are yet to ascertain the mastermind of the plot
 lekin ham aapako us kaali raat kaa sach bataa sakate hai or wo bhi khud uske munh se jisaki vajah se asaram ko jail janaa padaa
 Alafaz, the victim of the self-proclaimed Saint Asaram, is still in pain
 ladki kii aapbeetee yaa yah kahen ki us kaali raat kaa kadava sach jindagi main kabhi naa bharne vaala jakhm ban chukaa he
 She tells how on the night of 15 August 2013, Asaram Bapu was seduced into the Jodhpur ashram and taken to Asaram's hut
 vahaan use pine ke liye doodh diya gaya or phir uske baad asaram baapu ne uskaa yon shoshan kiya
 The girl alleges that Asaram Bapu later threatened her that if he mentioned this to anyone, he could harm the girl's parents
 shahjampur pahunchakar ai himmatladaki ne bataaya ki ghatana ke baad vah apane mata-pita ke saath shahjahanpur waapas aa gai
 On reaching Shahjahanpur, the girl got courage and told her mother everything
 maa ne uske pita ko bataai or phir puraa parivaar 19 agast 2013 ko dilli pahunch gaya
 But Asaram Bapu refused to meet the family
 lihaaja 20 agast 2013 ko ladki ne dilli ke kamala market thane membaba ke khilaaf yon shoshankarne kii report likhaa di
 In this way, the whole truth of the black night of 15 August 2013 came to the fore
 asaram ko giraftaar karne ke liye police ko kaaphi mashkkat kerani padi or aakhirkaar 1 sitambar 2013 ko police ne asaram ko uske indore ashram se raat ke kareeb 12:30 baje giraftaar kar hi liya
 Since that day, after going to jail once in this case, till today Asaram Bapu is pleading in the court to get bail
 katl kaa silasiliamritbhai gulabchand prajapati asaram baapu ke purv nijee vaidya or raajadaar the
 But after witnessing in court against Asaram on May 22, 2014, he was killed by anonymous gunmen at Rajkot's clinic
 11 janvari 2015 ko asaram ke purv sevadaar or rasoiyaa akhil gupta ko baap-bete ke khilaaf sarkari gavaah banane ke baad ghar ke najadik hi gumnaam bandookdhaariyon ne goliyon se chalni kar diya
 And now on 11 July 2015, Kripal Singh died
 kripal par 10 july ko jaanaleva hamalaa kiya gaya tha
 Kripal Singh was also shot dead by two motorcycle riders at 8 pm on the night of the attack in Shahjahanpur when he was on his way back home
 vahaan se unhen bareli refer kar diya gaya, lekin kripal singh kii jaan nahin bachaai ja saki
 According to doctors, Kripal had paralysis due to injury to the spinal cord and his chances of survival were slim
 police ke mutabik kripal singh ne marane se pehletinon logonke naam liye the or wo philhal un teenon ko giraftaar karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 Read further, the story behind the murder
 
 
 katl ke peeche kii kahaniasaram ke rasoiyaa rahe akhil ko bhi mujffanagar main bike par aae do logon ne thik usee tarah apni goliyon kaa nishaanaa banaaya tha jaise kripal singh ko banaaya gaya
 So is this just the same way of attacking all the witnesses who open their mouth against Asaram? Or is it something else? Akhil Gupta, who had once served as a cook for Asaram and his son Narayan Sai, lived in his home town of Muzaffarnagar these days
 wo in baap-bete ke saath kareeb das saalon tak rahaa, lekin phir vahiin ek ladki se shaadi karne ke baad wo waapas apane ghar mujffarnagar laut aayaa
 After this, he was doing the business of dairy living here, but on January one night, at about quarter to eight, he was returning to his house on a scooter
 achaanak bike par aae kuch hamalaavaron ne use peeche se goli maari or andhere kaa phayda uthaakar faraar ho gaye
 Akhil was later taken to the hospital, but by then he had died
 darasal, akhil surat kii do bahanon kii shikaayat ke baad asaram or narayan sai ke saath rape ke maamle kaa mulgim ban chukaa tha kyonki un dinon akhil ne bhi kathith taur par baap-bete kii karatuut main unka saath diya
 Akhil's life took a new turn on 19 October 2013 when suddenly the Gujarat Police took him from Muzaffarnagar to Surat with him
 vahaan police kii poochtacha ke baad wo asaram or narayan sai ke khilaaf gavaahi dene ko taiyaar ho gaya
 He also got his statements recorded, but before the court decides, Akhil Gupta was killed
 kuch aisa hi tha doosraa katlavaidya amrit prajapati bhi rajkot ke pedak road par apni clinics main baithe the
 Then two unknown persons entered the clinic and opened fire on them
 haalanki unhen fouran aspataal le jaaya gaya, lekin ilaaj ke dauraan unki maut ho gai
 Prajapati was also an important witness in the ongoing sexual abuse case on Asaram Bapu, but surprisingly, the police have not been able to find his murderer till date
 dopaher kaa vakt tha
 On 22 May 2014, Vaidya Amrit Prajapati of Rajkot was sitting in his clinic Omshanti on Pedak Road in Rajkot
 tabhi do anjaan shaks clinics main daakhil hote hai or bilkul paas se prajapati ko do gaali maarthe hai
 One tablet escapes by touching the ear while the other is applied on the face
 goli maarane ke baad hamalavar to faraar ho jate hai, lekin aspataal main ilaaj ke dauraan prajapati kii maut ho jaati he
 Prajapati's death is not a minor death
 awwal to ye ek aisa murder he, jise behad khaufnak tareeke se anjaam diya gaya or doosraa prajapati hi wo shaks the, jinhone pehali baar asaram kii karatuuton masalan ekantavaas, panchet booti or yon shoshan kii pole kholi thi
 But even more importantly, Prajapati was the most important witness against Asaram

 The American writer Tom Clangie wrote, "I believe that sex is the most beautiful, natural and complete pleasure in the world that can be bought with money
" ‚Äù tom kii in panktiyon se bollywood sabak le chukaa he
 Tom may have said this in some other context, but if we look at the previous report card of Bollywood, then it is proved that even in the Indian audience, a section has been prepared which is going to see a sex comedy or erotic thriller on screen
 bollywood main aisi paudh bhi taiyaar ho rahi he jo isi johnor kii filmein hi bananaa chaahati he
 Then, whether it is Pritish Nandi's daughter Rangita Nandi or senior filmmaker Indra Kumar or Queen of Erotic producer Ekta Kapoor
 bollywood main irotic filmon ke johnor kii lokapriyata se hi porn star se hindi filmon main naam ban chukin sani leyoni ne yah ghoshnaa kar di he, ‚Äú2016 edlt kamedis kaa saal rahane vaala he
 "they have not said this just like that
 saal ke pehle maheene main hi do edlt kamedi relies ho rahi hai
 Kya Kool Hai Hum Series on January 22, and Sunny Leone's Mastizaade on January 29
 is tarah irotic filmon kaa ek aisa johnor taiyaar ho chukaa he jisamen na sirf produsar acha paisa kama rahe hai balki un kalakaaron ke liye bhi yah malai khaane jaisaa ho gaya he, jinka kariyar menstream filmon main patari par nahin aa sakaa or phir aise nae log bhi hai jinhen bollywood main kariyar shuru karne ke liye maukey kii talash he
 In a society where sex is considered taboo, what are the stars who are doing films of this genre? This can also be understood by the example of Daisy Shah
 unhone apni irotic thriller het story-3 ke hit hone ke baad kaha tha, ‚Äúagar mujhe jai ho ke baad achche ofer mili hote to maine het story-3 nahin kii hoti
 "it was the taboo associated with Erotic films, which is why he said so because he started his career in Bollywood with superstar Salman Khan from Jai Ho (2014)
 uske baad unhen koi acha mauka nahin mil sakaa
 However, he also admitted, "hit Story-3 was my right decision
 ‚Äùkuch aisi hi kahani jarine khan kii bhi thi, jinhone 2010 main vir main salmaan khan ke saath kapadon main dabi-dhaki rajkumaari kaa role kiya tha, par 2015 aate-aate unhen het story-3 main bold andaaj ko chunanaa padaa
 He made a dagger on the hearts of the audience with his frenetic performances and continued the success of the Hate Story franchise
 unhone kaha, ‚Äúeemaandaaree se kahuun ki agar mujhe bina lovemeking yaa kising vaali film kerani pade to yah dharmik film hi hogi
 Shilpa Shukla has a similar case
 bi

 aftab kii kismat bhi edlt kamedi grand masti (2013) se dobaaraa clic hui or is saal unki do edlt kamedi kya kool hai ham-3 or great grand masti relies hongi
 In this way, it is opening new paths for genre careers
 het story-3 ke diarector vishaal pandya kehete hai, ‚Äúhet story kii har film main aisi heroinon ko chunaa gaya jinhone isse pehle is johnor main haath nahin aajamaaya tha
 Films also played due to content
 ‚Äù ve maanate bhi hai ki image ke chakkar main bade sitare in filmon main haath aajamaane se bachate hai
 New star and foreigner Qudiandeji Shah recently said, ‚Äúsex has been selling in Indian films for the last ten years
 agar film main bada sitara na ho to film ko chalaane ke liye aise masaale kii jarurat he
 People are coming to theaters for entertainment, they are spending big money and they need bold content
 ‚Äù dehali beli main imran khan ko chhod diya jaae to puri starcast ekadam nai thi
 Similarly, in Hate Story due to her bold female characters, Pauli Dam crossed the limits of boldness, while in the second part Surveen Chawla took the lead
 is tarah grand masti kii sabhi mahila paatr chaahe vah karishma hon yaa phir bruna abdulla yaa phir mariyam-bollywood ke liye bahut nai hi thim
 Sonali Raut and Urvashi Rautela, the heroines of Great Grand Masti, are also an old film in Bollywood
 sonaali ne himesh reshmia kii expoj main khub expoj kiya tha, or surkhiyaan batori thim
 Another film produced by Ekta Kapoor has been added to the contract of stars of Triple x even to the nudity clause
 udhar, vikram bhatta kii lav games main patralekha (citilites) or tara alisha beri (mastaram) ne sirf ek-ek film hi kii he
 Says a film expert, "often the big stars keep away from the erotic genre, they feel that they can be typecast by this type of film, and they can be demanded in a similar way while the younger stars get a break
 Should happen
 agar diarector bada he
 If the banner is large then they take this kind of risk
 ‚Äùvideshi chamadi kaa jaadu barkaraar he
 Indians have always been the craze of foreign girls
 bollywood is baat kaa sabase bada gavaah he, jahaan har duusare yaa tisare shuukravaar aisi film relies hoti he jisamen koi nai videshi bala launch hoti he
 These same beauties are becoming the face of Erotic films
 jism-2 yaa mastijade kii sani leyoni yaa phir kya kool hai ham-3 kii mandana karimi or grand masti main bruna abdulla (brazilian model) or mariyam jakariya (swedish-irani) ne apni adaaen dikhaai hai
 Mastizaade producer Rangita Nandi also tells her film's USP Sunny Leone
 badal gaya taana-banalgbhag do dashak pehle tak morning sho irotic filmein dekhne ke thikaane hote the
 But with the advent of the Internet, this material came into the hearts of the people and bold films of other languages, from Hollywood's American Pie, became available for everyone
 aise main bollywood main bhi aajamaaish shuru hui
 Initially, mainstream heroines also tried their hand at it
 isaki misaal manisha koirala kii ek choti si lav story (2002) he
 In which a teenager is caught in the guise of a girl twice his age
 udhar, bipasha basu ne jism (2003) se chamatkaar kiya or juli (2004) main neha dhoopiya ne bhi darshakon kii kalpana ko pankh laga die
 However, with big stars, the danger becomes of being typecast, which Neha Dhupia later succumbed to
 do ladakiyon ke bich samalangik sambandhon par bani garlfriend (2004) kamjor script kii vajah se flop rahi jabaki isi saal malikaa saharaavat kii da anaphedphul kii rimek murder superhit rahi
 By the end of 2011, this genre of adult comedies made strong strides with Dehli Bailey
 yah tathy shuru se hi kaayam rahaa ki kamjor kahani yaa foohadataa ke dam par film nahin chalaai ja sakati
 Rangita also agrees
 "I gave Milap Jhaveri 10 minutes to listen to the script of the film
" un 10 minute main meraa hans-hanskar bura haal ho gaya
 If the film is bad then people will see only once, but if the story is powerful then they will watch again and again
 ‚Äùtabhi to 2015 main relies hui guddu kii gan jaisi kamjor kahani vaali film box offis par aundhe munh gir gai jabaki hunter (2015) ne darshakon kaa dil jeeta
 It says, "what you see sells
" ‚Äù yah is johnor ke bare main sahi he or aisa ho bhi rahaa he
 But to survive this, a strong story has to be held

 In the village of Serengisa in Chaibasa district, a 45-year-old woman was described as a witch and beaten by six youths

 Sahitya Aajtak had a long conversation with Yatindra Mishra on 'akhtari: Soz and Saaz Ka Afsana'
 khaas anshah1
 Music and music seeker have been your main subjects? The reason for this? Yatindra Mishra: It is true that in the years here, i have made the life and art of music seekers the subject of my writing
 yah sayas kiya gaya he
 Also because i feel that there should be a detailed work on the cultivation of important artists in the fields of arts and liberal arts
 vah sirf likhakar hi nahin, balki audio, video madhyam ke dwaara bhi karne kii zarurat he
 It has been my favorite job to write on music seekers
 main sangeet-premi hoon uski baarikiyon ko samajhane kaa jatan karata hoon or usase aswaad paakar koshish karata hoon ki use likhakar vyakt karuun, jo vyapak arthon main jan-saamaanya ke aswaad kaa kaaran bane
 Therefore, by writing, i try to create curiosity about music and arts in the educational society
 2
 Who attracts you more in the personal life of music and music seekers and their creation journey? Yatindra Mishra: It is a bit difficult to say whether personal life attracts more or that creation journey
 ek tarah se dekhen, to paayenge ki donon hi ek-duusare ke poorak hai
 Sometimes life looks through creation and sometimes on the pretext of creation, we can catch the vision of that artist towards life
 main apni qitaab ke udhaaharan se yadi baat karuun, to ‚Äòlata: sur-gaatha‚Äô ke sandarbh main yah kahana chaahoonga ki maine lata mangeshkar ji ke upar qitaab likhte hue unke jivan kaa utana hi ansh shaamil kiya, jo kahin na kahin unke sangithik sangharsh, unke banane-sanvarane kii prakriya or us kala main unke utkarsh kii kahani kahata tha
 i did not write the things which were related to life and did not have a very deep connection with their music
 to is tarah aap kah sakate hai ki donon main koi aantarik sambandh banataa, to vah mere lekhak or pathak donon ke liye hi kargar hota
 Just personal life, no matter who it is, is not a matter of knowing for the society and the world at all levels
 niztaa kii bhi garima he, jise yathasambhav barkaraar rakhaa janaa chahie
 Book excerpts: Akhtari: The Soil and Saaz's Affliction; 3 of Dastan malika-e-ghazal
 aapane ustad bismilla khan, girija devi, lata mangeshkar or sonal maansingh jaisi shakhsiyaton par kitaaben likhin
 Where do you find Begum Akhtar? Yatindra Mishra: i am lucky that i got a chance to do some work on big artists like Ustad Bismillah Khan, Lata Mangeshkar, Girija Devi and Sonal Mansingh
 main har manch se yah baat sweekaarta hoon ki in sab par pustak likhane se zyaada bada anubhav us rachana-prakriya se guzarane kaa rahaa he, jo in murdhanyon kii sohabat ke chalate hasil hua
 a book like 'lata: sur-gatha' has been read and appreciated, it is a great pleasure for me
 
 
 
 But even bigger than this is the experience of my life, which i spent talking with Adarniya Lata ji for seven-eight years and staying close and listening to the interesting stories of the world of playback singing
 inhen sab ke bich begum akhtar sahiba kii kahani bhi mujhe utani hi dilachasp, prerak or sarthak lagati he
 Knowing the kind of life she had and how she aspires to rise above the Tawaif tradition to become a Begum, one has to understand the social, political structure of that era to an extent
 aaj unhen gayi pantalis se adhik varsh ho rahe hai, or lagbhag in pachaas saalon main unki khyaati badhati hi gayi he
 Only an entire generation listening to them and singing like them is present and new generation is constantly joining them
 aise main, unki yaadon ko sanjona or unki dharohar ko ekatra kar nayi peedi ko saunpane kaa kaam, ek zaruri baat lagati thi
 Unfortunately in Hindi it had not happened yet
 is kaaran, begum akhtar par kaam karnaa mujhe praasangik laga

 'akhtari: soz or saz kaa afasaana' kitaab ke bare main kuch bataaie?yatindra mishrah yah qitaab begum akhtar ke jivan par shodh karke sampadit kii gayi he
 It took special care to prepare a discussion on all those things related to his musical journey and life, so that the long journey from Akhtaribai Faizabadi to Begum Akhtar can be reviewed
 khud mere lekhon or tippaniyon ke alaava isamen sangeet or begum akhtar ke visheshgyon se lekh likhvaaye gayi hai, jinamein iqbaal rizvi, dow
 Rakhshanda Zalil, Kunal Ray, Salim Kidwai, Sheela Dhar, Drs
 praveen jha or mamata kaaliya jaise vidwaan shaamil hai
 Many big fans of the music world have also started writing pen for Begum Sahiba here
 inamen pramukh rup se shruti sadolikar, shubha mudgal, anish pradhan, kaumudi munshi, malini avasthi aadi kii tippaniyan pard sakate hai
 Along with this, the long conversation with two of his major disciples is also an attraction of the book, in which names of Shanti Hiranandji and Rita Ganguly can be taken
 ek had tak ‚Äòakhtari: soz or saz kaa afasaana‚Äô, begum akhtar ke jivan par daastangoi kii shakl main ek aitihaasik paath kii tarah kaa dastauez he, jisamen unke malikaa-e-ghazal banane kii kahani bhi saath-saath chalati he
 5
 begum akhtar par likhte hue, aapako unke jivan kii kis baat ne adhik prabhavit kiya?yatindra mishrah begum akhtar sahiba kii zindagi ke jis paksh ne mujhe sarvaadhik prabhavit kiya, vah unka unmukt jivan he
 How a singer and film actress in the first half of the last century got into a big tenor due to her personality's boldness, schism, generosity and artistry, reading and understanding it was like knowing the cultural and political contexts of that era
 in sab baton kii roshni main mujhe begum akhtar ek bade fanakaar or utani hi badi insaan ke rup main nazar aati hai
 i have tried to catch it
 6
 For whom is this book useful? Yatindra Mishra: This book is not only useful for music lovers or Begum Akhtar's fans
 mujhe lagata he ki itihaas or samaaj-vigyaan main ruchi rakhane waalon ko bhi ‚Äòakhtari‚Äô pasand aayegi
 Books written under references woven to a specific character in a particular period, also give a reminder of that period
 ve us itihaas kaa dastauez hoti hai
 The same situation is also with 'akhtari'
 ek gayika usee tarah apane samay ko darz karte hue ek bade aitihaasik pariprekshya main vimarshmulak ho sakati he, jis tarah apane daur main samant, nawab, ek sainik yaa yoddha, samaaj sudhaarak, raajnneetik log, aadhyatmik sant or abhinayta-abhinetri aadi hote hai

 Who is unaware of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'swachh Bharat Mission'? To keep cities and villages clean, the central government is constructing toilets from house to house
 is vishay par 'toilet ek prem katha' naam kii film bhi aa chuki he, jisamen abhinayta akshay kumaar logon ko swatchta abhiyaan ke liye prerit karte najar aa rahe hai
 However, in Bihar's Supaul, toilet became not a love story, but a 'toilet is a Gadar Katha'
 darasal, yahaan ke ek bujurg se subah-subah toilet ko lekar afasar ulajh gaye
 Now, the question is, why did the officers become angry in the name of the toilet? Yes, under the garb of cleanliness campaign, an officer abuses an elderly and a minor and gets a meeting
 saath hi marpet or thane main daalane kii dhamkee detaa he
 Its video is becoming very viral on social media nowadays
 is video main ek adhikari or uske saath kuch pulisavaale maujuud hai
 The officer goes out on rounds in the morning and sees an elderly man coming from the field
 uskaa lotaa bhi zabt karvaa letaa he
 The officer asks the elder why he did not build the toilet? Responding to this, the elder says that work is going on at home
 teen-chaar din main puraa ho jayega, lekin aap paisa to dijie
 As soon as he says this, the officer turns red-yellow on the elderly and then hears the decree from being abused to slapped
 iske baad afasar ke saath aae pulisavaale uthak-baithak karavaate hai or bachche ko thappad maarthe hai
 Meanwhile, someone makes a full video of the incident and goes viral on social media
 ab ham jaananaa chaahate the ki kya vaaki aisa hua? isliye hamane iskaa viral test kiya or video kii padtaal karne ke liye sidhaa supaul kaa rukh kiya
 It was discovered in the investigation that this video is from Baskhowra village of Supaul and the officer who is doing the rogue in the name of cleanliness is DCLR Akhilesh Prasad Verma
 ye video ek november kaa he
 DCLR Saheb was on the rounds in the village and the villagers got agitated on seeing the lota
 itnaa hi nahin, wo budtameezi or pitayee karne par utar aae
 Elder Boki Yadav repeatedly says that a toilet is being built in his house
 aap jaakar dekh lijie, lekin adhikari koshauchalayaka muyna karnaa manzur nahin tha
 Let us tell you that the local public representatives are also confirming that more than half of the toilets are built
 is viral video kii satyata jaanchane ke liye hamaare sanvadata ne adhikari DCLR akhilesh prasad verma or supaul jile ke jiladhikari se sampark kiya, lekin koi bhi is maamle par baat karne ko taiyaar nahin hue
 In such a situation, the question arises whether India will be clean due to such insolence of officers
 agar DCLR akhilesh prasad verma ko bujurg par yakeen nahin tha, to uske ghar jaakar muyna kyon nahin kiya? is tarah ye khabar viral test main sach sabit hui

 The manner in which the Kashmiri separatists gave preference and strongly welcomed the Pakistan High Commissioner in Delhi on Monday on Nepakistan Day is less than condemned
 yah jaanate or maanate hue bhi ki kashmir kaa maamla donon deshon ke bich kaa maamla he, pakistan ne kashmiri algaavvaadiyon ko itnaa mahatv diya
 All the separatist leaders of Kashmir came there and the Pakistani High Commissioner himself went ahead and welcomed them, which is not a hug
 ek ore to pakistan bharat se behatar sambandh kaayam rakhane kii baat karata he to duusari ore bhadakaane vaale kaam bhi karata he

 He is not giving any good indication by making handful of separatists his special guests here
 behatar hota ki vah gambhirtha se bharat ko baatcheet kaa ek mauka detaa or is avasar ko yaadgaar banane kii koshish karata, lekin usne yah mauka ganvaa diya
