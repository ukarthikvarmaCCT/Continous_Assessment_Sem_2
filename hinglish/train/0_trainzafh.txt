 In Saharanpur, UP, a strange incident of burning two girls in a mosque in the name of sorority has come to light
 nanauta kasbe kii is ghatana kaa ek sira jaadu tone se bhi judaa he
 In the same mosque of this town, Mu'azin, who taught namaz, tried to sabotage two girls who came to read Urdu and Quran and tried to burn them when they protested
 muazgin ne pehle do bacchiyon aath saal kii shipha khan or uski ek saheli par mitti kaa tel chhidak kar aag laga di
 However, when the noise was made by the girls, people immediately reached the spot, which saved both their lives
 is ghatana main shipha gambhir rup se jhulas gai, or dehradun ke aspataal main uskaa ilaaj chal rahaa he
 Significantly, Shifa, the eight-year-old daughter of Shamshad, a resident of Chhatta Mohallaan, used to visit Urdu and Quran mosques daily from Muazzin Mursalin
 shanivaar ko shipha roj kii hi tarah ek ladki ke saath masjid gai to kuch der padhaane ke baad mursaline shipha par tona-totaka karne laga
 The two girls protested and put mud on the fire
 bacchiyon kaa shor sunakar log daude-daude moke par pahunche
 Shifa is severely scorched, but her friend has only burns
 acroshit log mursaline ko pakadakar peet rahe the tabhi vahaan nagar panchayat chairman afjaal khan bhi pahunch gaye

 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye congress ke taiyaar hone ke saath hi grand old party main sabase zyada 'yatra model' ko lekar charchaa ho rahi he
 There is a lot of enthusiasm in the party for Congress President Rahul Gandhi's first 'navsarjan Yatra' in Gujarat and now 'jan Ashirwad Yatra' in Karnataka
 partijanon kaa maananaa he ki in donon yatraaon ne apane naamon ke mutabik hi congress main 'nayaa josh' laane ke saath party ko 'aashirwad' diya he
 This is the reason that the party is going to adopt this 'travel model' in a big way for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as well
 sutron ke mutabik party adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne iske liye hari jhandi bhi dikhaa di he
 Wanting change, the idea of 'travel model' first came up with the same thinking that he wanted to bring about a change in the culture of Hong Kong Congress
 is model se naa sirf party ko logon se sampark kaa jariya mila balki isane netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ke bich avarodhon ko bhi kuch had tak hataane kaa kaam kiya
 a senior Congress leader from Gujarat says, 'rahul Gandhi has always been talking about a change in the culture of the party
 wo chaahate the ki dilli main baithe party ke sheersh netaa desh ke doordaraj ilaakon main jaakar party kaaryakartaaon or aam logon se sampark banaaen
 Both of Rahul's visits did this with success
 isse jahaan party main sakaaratmak badlaav aayaa, vahiin baahar bhi party kii chhavi ko behatar banane main bhi madad mili
 The yatra which started last year started the process of Rahul's Navsarjan Yatra in Gujarat in September 2017
 yatra ke liye khaastaur par taiyaar kii gai jis isuju bas se gujarat main navasarjan yatra karte dikhe, usee bas se karnataka main bhi 'jan aashirwad yatre' karte dikhe
 During the Gujarat assembly elections, the Congress leadership suggested that Rahul use a helicopter during the election campaign, but Rahul decided to measure the entire state by bus to reach the people
 gujarat ke liye incharge congress netaa rajeev saatav kehete hai, 'gujarat prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan pehle yahi vichaar kiya gaya tha ki rahul gandhi helicopter kaa istemaal karte hue reliyon ko sambodhit karen
 But Rahul Gandhi clearly said that he wants to use the bus so that the entire leadership of the party travels together and reaches the people
 'bijepi ke khilaaf 'dharmayuddh'dirghakaalik ranneeti ke tahat 27 sitambar 2017 ko yatra kii shuruyaat ke liye prasiddh tirthanagari dwarka ko chunaa gaya
 Rahul declared a 'crusade' against the BJP from Dwarkadhish temple there
 bihar ke liye congress incharge shakti singh gohil ke mutabik dwarka se bijepi ke khilaaf congress ne jo dharmayuddh shuru kiya tha wo 2019 loksabhaa chunaav kii jang ke saath khatm hoga
 The idea behind 'navasarjan' and 'jan Aashirwad', both 'minimum investment, maxim campaign', was formed on the basis of both visits
 rahul kii donon yatraaon kaa root is tarah rakhaa gaya ki gramin ilaakon ke logon tak zyada se zyada pahunchaa ja sake
 There was a greater emphasis on contact with people at Nukkad meetings, Mohalla meetings and reception sites than at large public meetings
 jahaan logon kii rahul ke netritv main party netaaon ke saath sidhe baat ho sake
 Rahul's visits were given a more personal touch when Rahul along with other party leaders were seen eating dhokla with tea in Gujarat and idli-dosa in Karnataka on roadside dhabas
 rahul ne in yatraaon ke dauraan party kaaryakartaaon, yuvaaon ko apane saath selfi khinchvaane ke bhi maukey die
 During the bus journey, the party leaders also got plenty of time to discuss among themselves
 rahul gandhi kii maujuudagi main party ke rajya str ke netaaon ke bich matbhed maukey par hi sulajhaaye gaye vahiin ummidavaaron ko tay karne or yojanaon ko lagu karne jaise faisle bhi haathon-haath liye gaye
 KC Venugopal, general secretary in charge of the party for Yatra Karnataka, is important for solidarity, "one of the important aspects of 'jan Ashirwad Yatra' in Karnataka has been that we have managed to show the world, the Karnataka Congress as a whole Is united
 rahul jahaan bhi jate sabhi netaaon ko saath lekar jate he, is ekajutata ko kaaryakartaaon or logon se bhi saraahna mili
 It is interesting to see that Congress strategists are looking at first Gujarat and now Karnataka elections as two phases of the big semi-final before the final battle of 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 gohil kehete hai, 'kai vichaaron or ranneetiyon ko parkhaa gaya
 The strategies that got good response and got a good message among the people will also be used in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 ab hamen pataa he ki koun sa plan logon main clic karegaa
 AICC general secretary Madhu Gaur Yakshi referred to an incident during Rahul's 'jan Ashirwad Yatra' in Karnataka
 yakshi ne bataaya, ki rahul party ke district offis pahunche or vahaan se block adhyakshon or booth cameti daftaron ke prabhariyon ko sidhe phone karnaa shuru kar diya
 At first the workers thought that someone was mocking them
 lekin jab unhen ahsaas hua ki sach main rahul gandhi se hi unki baat ho rahi he to unhen sukhad aashcharya hua
 This in itself
 jan aashirwad yatre
 There is a huge success with the involvement of activists
 rajeev saatav kehete hai, 
 Such visits are also making it easier for the party leadership to understand what is the ground reality
 pehle rajyon ke netaa dilli jaakar jaankaree dete the
 But now the central leadership is getting immediate and direct feedback
 yani logon kii nabj ko sidhe jaanane kaa mauka mil rahaa he
 
 baharhaal, nae adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke netritv main congress yahi maan rahi he ki 
 Travel model
 party ke liye bijepi ke khilaaf 
 Brahmastra
 kii tarah kaam karegaa

 After websites ridiculing Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi, preparations are being made to build a website on Congress leader and UPA minister Kapil Sibal
 isaki taiyaari main juty hai mumbai kii ek house wif
 His name is Vidyut

 What message does she want to convey in cyber space, through satire

 Apart from this, i also run a site called Publicity
 gusse kaa nateeja he yemeri koi chaalu politics nahin he
 i am not a supporter of BJP or Congress
 main saporter hum to logon kii
 That is why when these politicians say something wrong, or turn back on their promise, they get angry
 usee gusse ko kabhi twit, kabhi site or kabhi post ke jariye logon ke saamne rakhti hum
 That is why i do not spare Narendra Modi of BJP nor Rahul Gandhi of Congress
 iskaa makasad sirf itnaa rahata he ki logon ko, unki chetana ko jagaane main madad kar sakuun
 Dare anyone who threatens who is in the Twitter world or on Facebook
 unhen pataa he ki is miss ko disturb nahin karnaa he kisi ghatiya harakat se
 Anyway, i try to give rational answers to those who run into my thoughts
 or jin logon ko lagata he ki ve apana naam yaa profile jaahir kiye bina hamalaa karenge, unako ye nahin pataa ki is tarah kii ghatiya harakat se unke makasad ko koi majbootee nahin milti
 Now after Bari Sibal's Harrahul and Modi, now i am thinking of creating a funny website on Kapil Sibal
 ye aadmi he ki bunker
 When he comes in front of the press, sometimes he talks about tapping the phone, sometimes he looks at ways of snatching freedom
 usko dekhte hi dimag kharaab hone lagata he
 So now i have thought that a site should also be created on Kapil Sibal

 tarif vaala lekh idhar udhar bikhar jaataa he, dil tut jaataa he or bachati he to bas maathaa pakade rahul kii tasviir
 It is made by electricity
 jab logon ne twitor par unase sawaal kiya ki kyon aap sirf bijepi ko nishaanaa bana rahi hai, to vidyut ne jawaab diya ki congressi rajkumaar ke liye bhi he kuch mere paas
 In a similar way, a website that puts a question mark on Narendra Modi has also been re-started by Vidyut
 vidyut twitor or fasebuk par bhi sakriy hai or rajanetaaon par vyangy karti rahati hai
 What electricity showed on Narendra Modi's site, click to know upi ke aligarh main christmas manaane ko lekar hindu jaagran manch ne skulon ko dhamkee bharaa patr likhaa he
 The forum has accused Christian schools of promoting Christianity through the festival
 is patr main hindu jaagran manch ne likhaa he ki skulon main isai bacchon kii sankhya behad kam hone ke baavjood 25 disambar ko christmas de manaaya jaataa he
 Hindu children coming to schools through programs on this occasion are compulsorily included
 jaagran manch ne aarope lagaaya he ki skool is tareeke se isai dharm kaa prabhaav hindu bacchon par daalane kii koshish kar rahe hai or unki maansikta ko dooshit karne kii sajeesh rach rahe hai
 The forum has also raised questions over schools becoming part of proselytizing
 is latter ke saamne aane ke baadpulice-prashasanabhi harakat main aa gaya he
 The Aligarh administration has met the management of all Christian and missionary schools in the area and assured them of full cooperation
 prashasan ne kaha he ki kisi ko bhi chrismas program main dakhal nahin dene di jaaegi
 The SSP of Aligarh said that they have not received any complaint in this regard so far
 lekin agar aisa he to ye gambhir maamla he or kisi ko isaki ijaajat nahin di jaaegi
 However, people associated with Jagran Manch say that they have issued these letters for schools where Hindus are essentially invited to attend the program
 aap jaraa kisi middle class family ke bich deepies shabd kaa zikr bhar kariye, saamne vaale ke kaan khadey ho jaaenge

 lekin desh main 200 se zyada skulon kaa sanchaalan karne vaali deepies socity main is baat par jang chhidi he ki socity kaa asli bos koun he? or kya deepies main bhrashtachar or dhaandhlee kaa bada khel chal rahaa he? vivaad itnaa bad chukaa he ki dilli ke east of kailash sthit sanstha ke mukhyalay main police ne socity ke aaajeevan sadasyon ke pravesh par pabandi laga di he
 Significantly, its schools have more than 2 lakh students and 20,000 teachers

 In this controversy of DPS Society having fixed deposits of more than Rs
 ke
 Shunglu, the last Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia, former President of the DPS Society, Ashok Chandra, including many dignitaries of the country are at stake
 socity kii aaajeevan sadsy dow
 Sharada Nayak claims that in the election held on March 28, 2015, the members of life have elected him as the president of the organization on the basis of majority and Shunglu is no longer in this position
 iske baad se, ek taraf nayak ke mobile kii ghanti shubhakamana sandeshon se ghanaghna rahi he, to duusari taraf sanstha ke mukhyalay main unke pravesh par pabandi lag gai he
 Rear Admiral M
, already posted as Vice President of the institution
 em
 Chopra has written a report against 8-year-old educationist for forcibly entering the institution
 nayak jis samay karyaalay main kathith rup se daakhil hone kii koshish kar rahi thim, us samay sanstha ke ek anya aaajeevan sadsy or purv videsh mantri salmaan khurshid bhi unke saath the
 Angered by the incident, Nayak complained to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal about the entire case
 ab shungalu kaa paksh suniah ''janvari 2014 main hue chunaav ke baad se teen saal ke liye main hi adhyaksh hum
 In this way, on some paper, some people cannot sign and elect a president
 ''darasal, scotland main janme shikshavid or congress netaa jagadish titalar ke pita james duglas titalar ne 1949 main jab deepies mathura road kii sthapana kii thi, tab unhen gumaan nahin rahaa hoga ki shiksha ke prasar se judi yah nijee sanstha itani raubadaar ho jaaegi
 That is why in January 2014, when the elections were held for the selection of DPS Society officials, it started to look like a war of power
 tab tatkaaleen adhyaksh ashok chandra or shungalu adhyaksh pad kii daud main shaamil the
 It was decided that on January 8, 2014, 18 lifelong members of the institution will elect new office bearers through voting
 chunki khushvanth singh tab biimaar the or do anya sadsy bhi gambhir vajahon se voting karne nahin aa paa rahe the, aise main in teenon ne ek band lipaphe main apane-apane vot mukhyalay bhej die
 When these envelopes arrived on January 7, it was said that the election is on 8th, so the envelope will be accepted only on 8th
 khayr, jab nateeja saamne aayaa to shungalu ko 9 or chandra ko 8 vot mili
 In this way Shunglu became the president of the society
 is bich pataa chalaa ki jo ek vot nahin padaa he, vah khushvanth singh kaa he
 Since the election was decided by one vote, Khushwant's vote could be decisive
 par isi bich unka nidhan ho gaya or unke vot kii gutthi unke saath hi chali gai
 Chandra challenged the election results in the Delhi High Court, but withdrew the case in March 2015
 usee ke baad tej hue ghatnakram main nayak ko achaanak adhyaksh bana diya gaya
 The second allegation of the Nayak faction is that during Chandra's tenure, Rs 25 crore was paid to the franchise
 kaa herpher hua, lekin shungalu is par karrwai nahin kar rahe hai
 Also, to hold the post of president, Shunglu was former IAS B
 ke
 Rahul Singh, son of Chaturvedi and Khushwant Singh, was made a lifelong member, so that in the event of elections, a majority could be in his favor
 iske alaava frenchiji dene ke evaj main kisi bhi tarah kii fees lene kii manaahi hone ke baavjood deepies socity par skulon se 12 lakh ru
 He is also accused of trying to collect annual money
 ye saare maamle gambhir hai

 " isisi world cap main buudhvaar ko pakistan kii newjiland par jeet ne cricket ke mahaasangram kaa romaanch badha diya he
 With this victory, the path to the semi-finals has become a little easier for Pakistan
 world cap point teble main chauthe number kii jagah ke liye ladaai or romaanchak ho gai he
 Let us know that after the 6-wicket win over New Zealand, the Pakistani cricket team is at number six on the point table
 saat maichon main pakistan kii yah teesri jeet he
 With this, Pakistan has got 7 points
 pakistan ko baaki bache do muqablon main afghanistan or bangladesh ke saath bhidana he
 Pakistan will have to win both these matches to get a semi-final ticket
 aise main pakistan ke liye har match semifinal kii tarah he kyonki ek haar bhi use toornament se baahar baithne par majaboor kar degaa
 Pakistan are now just one point of fourth place 👀 # CWC19 | # nzvpak | # wehavewewillpic

 com / t9avfjjpd5 — Cricket World Cup (@cricketworldcup) June 26, 2019 Australia has already made it to the semi-finals
 uske alaava newjiland kii team ko semifinal main pahunchane ke liye ek jeet kii darkaar he
 Apart from these two teams, Team India is in a very strong position and with a win, its semi-final ticket will be almost fixed
 bharat kii sambhaavna isliye bhi zyada he kyonki uske abhi 4 match baaki hai
 At the same time, in the case of other teams, there are 2-2 matches left of England, Bangladesh and Pakistan and both matches are equal to 'do or die' for all the teams to reach the semi-finals
 iske alaava srilanka ke 3 match bache hai or use teenon jeetne honge
 Why will the three teams pray for England's defeat? The situation is such that if England loses both their matches, then the remaining three teams (pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka) will have a chance in the semi-finals
 england ko baaki bache do muqablon main bharat or newjiland kaa saamana karnaa he or ye donon hi timen behad majboot maani ja rahi hai
 Interestingly, in the World Cup, England has not been able to win a single victory over these two teams in the last 27 years
 england kaa aglaa muqabla bharat ke saath 30 june ko hona he
 This is the reason that Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka will pray that India will defeat England in this match and their semi-final path becomes easier
 semifinal main australianstralia semifinal main pahunchane vaali pehali team he, uske khate main 12 ank hai
 They have to play two more matches and even if both matches are lost, it will not make any difference
 australia ke baad 6 maichon main 11 ankon ke saath newjiland world cap points teble main duusare number par he
 With just one more win, the New Zealand team will reach the semi-finals
 udhar team india ke liye bhi raste aasaan dikh rahe hai
 India have 9 points from 5 matches and the remaining 4 matches are also to be played against weaker teams
 aise main semifinal main team india kii jagah bhi pakki dikh rahi he
 The problem for Sri Lanka is that they will have to beat India, West Indies and South Africa to reach the semi-finals
 vahiin, pakistan kii team ko afghanistan or bangladesh se bhidana he
 Ekta Kapoor's production house film 'mantle Hai Kya' is making a lot of headlines on social media these days
 film ke posters main kangana ranut or rajkumaar raav kaa andaaj logon kaa khub pansad aa rahaa he
 But the news is that Ekta has angered Salman Khan
 aakhir kya he vajah chaliye jaanate hai
 
 
 
 khabar he ki khan bros yani sohail or salmaan khan ekta ke apni agali film ke liye mental tital kaa istemaal karne kii vajah se naaraaz hai
 The teaser release of Salman's TV show Dus Ka Dum, Video Deccan Chronicle reports, sources have said that Sohail wanted to retain the title of 2014 film 'jai Ho'
 vahiin kabir khan ne bhi film 'tubalite' kaa naam mental rakhane ke bare main soch vichaar kiya tha
 The name Mantle had been on salman-sohail's mind for a long time and he wanted to use it in one of his films
 a post shared by Kangana Ranaut (@team_kangana_ranaut)onmar 6, 2018 at 11:30pm pstlekina ab ekta kapur ne yah naam le liya he
 Hence, Khan Brothers' desire to retain the mantle title remained incomplete
 sutara bataate hai ki ekta ne is bare main salmaan-sohail se koi baat nahin kii thi or film ke naam kaa elaan kar diya
 Salman Khan will run the Ferrari of Dubai's richest child in Race-3? When Sohail was asked about this, he said, No, we did not give the mantle title to Ekta
 yahaan tak ki unhone hamase poocha tak nahin

 In Sahebganj block of Banka, two kilograms of mangoes are being sold at the rate of Rs 10-12 per kg
 ' In a survey conducted in the last week of May, the industry association Assocham had said that due to unseasonal rains mango crop has been destroyed in many states, so it has become expensive and the market gets Rs 100 per kg
 While special varieties are selling more expensive
 surveykshan main chaahe kuch bhi kaha gaya ho, bihar ke bhagalpur or baankaa jile ke aam log shikaayat nahin kar rahe hai

 2019 main ham shandaar bahumat ke saath dobaaraa waapas aaenge or is saal ke aakhir main chunaav main jane vaale teen rajya bhi jeetenge
 The reason for so much confidence in spite of the opposite signs? In two respects, the Modi government seems completely different and most people of this country are praising it
 is sarkaar ne garibi or bhrashtachar se ladgaye kii jaisi himmat dikhaai he, waisi pehle kii kam hi sarkaron ne dikhaai thi
 We are fighting corruption at both the upper and lower levels

 There is a lot of resentment because of the Trinamool's reckless rule and the use of violence as a strategy to suppress the opposition

 What strategy will you adopt to counter the grand alliance against the BJP? We do not need to do anything about the grand alliance
 hamen hamaari party ke dhaanche ko majboot karnaa he or apni sarkaar kii yojanaon ke boote par sabase garib logon tak pahunchnaa he
 i think we will get help from Narendra Modi vs others
 isse matadaataaon ko pataa chalegaa ki tamaam partiyaan or netaa kis tarah us ek shaks ke khilaaf girohaband ho rahe hai jo vyavastha ko paardarshee banane ke liye ise badalane or unke liye, saadhaaran aadmi ke liye barabari kaa maidan banane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Do you have any fear about the 2019 elections? The fear is those who are not ready for the challenges
 hamane 2019 ke liye 27 may, 2014 se hi kaam karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 Rather the fear is clearly visible in the opposing parties, the way they are uniting against us and trying to form a grand alliance
 *** This is news of relief for reliance-adag chairman Anil Ambani and his wife Tina
 sibiai ne saaf taur par kaha he ki use is aashay kaa koi saboot nahin mila he ki anil or tina ambani 2ji ghotaale kii daagi company swaan telecom ke us samay vaastavik swami or labhaarthi the, jis samay use purv telecom mantri e
 The license was given by the king
 sibiai ne 29 sitambar ko suhdhim court main die prativedan main sabase gambhir aarope se anil or tina ambani ko doshamukt karte hue kaha ki vah do dishaao main jaanch jari rakhe hue he, jisamen reliance-adieji ke pramukh shaamil hai
 The CBI affidavit stated that Swan Telecom's share holders were Tiger Traders Pvt Ltd (91 per cent) and Reliance Telecom (9 per cent) while filing an application for unified access service (UAS) license before the Telecom Department
 us samay reliance telecom vaid dhang se 10 pratishat se kam kii hissedari rakh saktaa tha
 The original ownership of the tiger traders became the center of the controversy, whose other two shareholders were Zabra Consultants and Parrot Consultants Private Limited
 kanoon kaa ulanghan sabit karne ke liye sibiai ko is saboot kii darkaar thi ki is companiyon kaa swaamitv anil or tina ambani ke paas he
 According to the CBI, a portion of the money invested in Tiger Traders' Swan was eventually found from ADAE Ventures Pvt Ltd and AAA Consultants
 in donon companiyon ko kisi jamaane main ambani parivaar ne shuru kiya tha
 But the Ambani family exited these companies in march-april 2006, a year before applying for UAS
 sibiai ne nishkarsh nikaala, ''jaanch se aisa koi likhit yaa maukhik sakshya nahin mila, jo anil ambani ko vibhinn companiyaan banane or paisa hastantarit karne kaa doshi hone kaa sanket detaa ho
 "she also says," During the referenced period, when Swan Telecom Private Limited applied for a UAS license and money was transferred from these companies (zebra and Parrot) to Tiger Traders Private Limited, Anil Ambani And his wife was neither a shareholder in these companies nor was he involved with the management of these companies
 ''lekin sibiai ne swaan kaa dhaancha banane main unki bhoomika ke liye reliance ke akjicutive hari nair, gautam doshi or surendra pipaara ko doshamukt nahin kiya he
 The CBI has told the court that these three officers can become government witnesses and reveal who were the real beneficiaries of Swan and its related companies
 reliance-adieji ne isse inkaar kiya he
 The CBI has also argued in a contradictory point that DB Group was the beneficiary of the license to Swan
 usne apni report main kaha he, ''license milane par swaan telecom ko koi laabh hone se pehle uskaa adhigrahan dibi group ne kar liya tha
 Hence, DB Group, not reliance-adag, benefited from Swan getting UAS license
 ''dibi group ke pramotor shahid balava, jo is maamle main aropit hai, chaar maheene se bhi zyada kii avadhi se dilli kii tihaad jail main hai
 However, CBI has not completely exonerated Anil Ambani in the 2G case
 vah swaan main reliance-adieji ke apane 9 pratishat share morishas kii delphi investment privet limited ko atyant riyayati daron par beche jane kii jaanch abhi bhi kar rahi he
 The sale was made soon after Raja's telecom division allowed Reliance Telecom to launch GSM services in 2007
 reliance telecom ne swaan main apane 1,07,91,000 share 15 ru
 Were sold per share
 sanyogvash, etisalaat ne swaan ke share 285 ru
 Per share
 sibiai kii daleel he ki reliance ne apane sheyaron kaa 'behad kam mulya lagaaya' or 7 karod, 60 lakh dollar kii bajaae 40 lakh dollar main unhen bech diya
 She is still investigating whether these shares were given in bribes
 vah delphi investments ke vaastavik labhaarthi kii pahchaan sthapit nahin kar saki he, jiskaa swaamitv do anya satahi companiyon morishas main maavi investment fund limited or switzraland main beaties belvoyar investment main khoja gaya he
 It has sought help from authorities in Mauritius and Switzerland
 jaanch kii duusari disha reliance-adieji group kii ore se ek gaiyr sarkari sanghathan tamil mayyam ko die gaye daan kii jaanch karnaa he, jisamen dramuk saansad or 2ji ghotaale kii abhiyukt ke
 Kanimozhi is the director
 sibiai kahati he, ''chunki daan kisi vyakti ko nahin balki ek kalyankari sanstha ko diya gaya he isliye dosha sabit karnaa kathin he, lekin daan ke samay ko dekhte hue lenden sandigdh najar aata he
 "CBI has also recorded that the same NGO was given Rs
 25 lakhs just before Tata was given the license
 kaa daan diya tha
 She again says that it is difficult to prove the blame, but does not say clearly that the timing of the donation is doubtful, as she said in the context of reliance-adag
 anil ambani par aarope na lagane ke bare main sibiai kaa kahana he ki usne sirf un logon par karrwai kii he, jinhone doorsanchaar par sidhe faisle kiye the
 Sanjay Chandra as well as Ajay and Ramesh Chandra are directors at Unitech, but only Sanjay made direct decisions in terms of telecommunications, and that is why he has been accused
 reliance ke sandarbh main, telecom ke saare nirnay doshi ne liye the
 CBI says, "doshi has not revealed whether there were any instructions from Anil Ambani and whether he was acting on those instructions
 ise dekhte hue anil ambani ko doshi tehraane ke liye koi saboot uplabdh nahin hai
 '' puducheri main uparajyapal kiran bedi ko ek tareeke se bandhak bana liya gaya he
 Actually, CM Narayanasamy and his cabinet members are staging a protest outside the Raj Niwas of Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi

 In her letter, Kiran Bedi wrote, 'you should have met instead of sitting on the dharna
 aap ek patr likhte or rajanivas kii nakaabandi se pehle mere jawaab kaa intjaar karte

 helicopter se barish karaane ke liye dilli sarkaar ab standard oparating prosiger (SOP) taiyaar karegi
 After a lengthy meeting with helicopter company Pawan Hans and more than 25 agencies, the environment department has been ordered to form a joint working group
 dilli sarkaar se 'aaj tak' ko mili exclusive jaankaree ke mutabik dephence, aviation, airport athurity ne anumati dene ke maamle main apni sahmati jataai he
 During the discussion, Pawan Hans company told that 8 grids will have to be built in Delhi to make rain by helicopter
 yah grid eendhan yaa pani ko dobaaraa bharne ke liye istemaal kiye jaaenge
 The company has told the government that 2 types of helicopters are proposed for the rain
 pehla, jiskaa kiraaya 2 lakh rupye prati ghanta hoga
 It will also have a capacity of 1000 liters of water
 doosraa, jiskaa kiraaya 4 lakh rupye prati ghanta he or isaki pani kii kshamta 3000 litre hoti he
 The speed of the helicopter during water spraying will be 50 to 60 kilometers per hour
 darasal dilli sachivalay main helicopter barish ke liye charchaa ke dauraan yah bhi saamne aayaa ki pani ke chhidkaav ke liye majboot visibility hona behad jaruri he
 In such a situation, rain by helicopter is possible only when the visibility is one and a half kilometers
 visibility ke maanak daayre ko civil aviation,mausam vibhaag, sipisibi, or dipisisi ne bhi sahi mana he
 According to the government, the company has said that special equipment is required for rain from a helicopter
 in upkaran ke liye videsh kii takanic ko apnaane kii jarurat he
 Apart from this, it is very important to take care of non-flying zone for rain from helicopter
 lutian dilli or central dilli non flying jone kaa hissaa hai
 Let us tell you that the permission of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Civil Aviation, Airport Authority, Defense and Air Force is required for rain from a helicopter
 dilli sarkaarake mutabik barish ke liye helicopter main pani or eendhan ke dobaaraa bharne ke liye helipad kii jarurat hogi
 This helipad Gurgaon, which will cover the South area
 rohinee main, jo north dilli cover karegaa
 At Hindon, which would cover the areas of the Yamuna crossing
 saath hi greater noida main bhi helipad banane ko lekar charchaa jari he
 For now, the government will prepare a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) which will handle helicopter rain cases
 yah prosiger alag-alag agenciyon se anumati lene se lekarhelicopter barishase jude har pahalu par kaam karegi
 The situation was not even after the Moody's report that state-run bank SBI surprised everyone by saying that the growth rate of the economy fell to 4 in the second quarter
 2 fisadi rah jaaegi
 That is, the government is not able to handle the economy
 esbiai kii report se ye sawaal uthne laga he ki kya desh main mandi dastak de rahi he?is saal july main bajet pesh karne ke baad vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne arthvyavastha ko dobaaraa patari par laane ke liye ek ke baad ek kai bade elaan kiye
 
 
 Deducted corporate tax, merged banks
 real estate ke liye 25000 karod ke fund ke elaan jaise bade faisle kiye
 But the economy does not appear to be under government control
 SBI ne apni tazaa report main kaha he ki is saal kii duusari timahi main GDP kii vikaas dar 4
 It is estimated to be 2 percent
 SBI ne agle vitt varsh ke liye vikaas dar kaa anumaan bhi 6
 Reduced from 1 to 5 percent
 rabindra gupta, chif manager, esbiai ne enditivi se kaha- SBI ne apni report main GDP growth forcast downgrad karne ke chaar kaaran bataae hai- global iconamik slodown, lo auto cells, construction or infrastracchar main investment kii kami, kor sector main growth kii giravat or air trephic movement main kami
 Industry association Assocham has expressed concern over the SBI report saying that there is a liquidity crisis in the banking sector
 deepak sood, secretary general, asocham ne enditivi se kaha-market main liquidity kaa problem abhi bhi he
 RBI has cut the rate to 150 basic points
 lekin abhi tak bainkon ne 30 se 40 basisppoint tak hi benifit kaa transmishan kiya he customer ke liye
 We demand from the government to tell the banks that the full benefit of the RBI rate cut should reach the industries
 arvind viramani, purv mukhya aarthik salaahkaar ne kaha, sarkaar ko or tex rifarm karnaa hoga, diarect tex code laana hoga, jiesti ko or saral, behatar or kargar bananaa hoga
 It is clear from the SBI report that the big decisions that the government has taken to bring the economy back on track in the last two months, do not seem to have any effective effect on the land and the government has to take fresh and big decisions to improve the health of the economy

 ' The portfolios of ministers have been reshuffled once again in the national capital, Delhi
 is baar pehle se hi kai mahatvapurn vibhaagon kaa kaamkaaj dekh rahe satyendra jain ko shahari vikaas jaise ahm vibhaag kaa mantri banaaya gaya he
 This department was earlier held by Deputy CM Manish Sisodia
 arvind kejariwal kii sarkaarake liye shahari vikaas vibhaag isliye myne rakhata he ki anadhikrut coloniyon main vikaas se lekar unhen niyamit karne, MCD ko samay-samay par nirdesh dene kaa jimmaa bhi isi vibhaag ke paas he
 It is also important that in this department, there is a great need to keep pace with the central government
 gauratlab he ki abhi do maheene bhi nahin hue jab satyendra jain ko dilli ke hisaab se ahm parivahan vibhaag kii jimmedaari saunpi gai thi
 Then Gopal Rai had the responsibility of transportation
 parivahan vibhaag main premium bason ko lekar hangaamaa hone par mukhyamantri kejariwal ne gopal raay se vibhaag lekar jain ko thama diya
 What is the meaning of this reshuffle, even a minor reshuffle in the cabinet is not unnecessary
 khaskar kejariwal sarkaar main to faisle kai vajahon ko tolmol kar hi liye jane kaa itihaas rahaa he
 It was clear only after taking the transport department from Gopal Rai that after Manish Sisodia in Delhi government, if he belongs to any minister, then he is Satyendar Jain, because he has high profile affairs like health, PWD, home, energy
 Were already
 jaahir taur par jain ke pehle se karne ko bahut kaam the, vahiin ab parivahan or shahari vikaas vibhaag dene kaa matlab saaf he ki wo kejariwal ke najdiki or bharosemand ban gaye hai
 Jain in the role of troublemaker! For the Kejriwal government, Satyendra Jain is probably in the role of troublemaker, as the Urban Development Department is necessary for the government in many ways in the coming times
 iske andar MCD aata he, jiske chunaav agle saal kii shuruyaat main hone vaale hai
 BJP has power in the municipal corporation
 uske alaava dilli sarkaar ko anadhikrut coloniyon ko niyamit karne ke liye centre ko sadhana jaruri he
 These are the same colonies where 40 percent of Delhi's population lives and is considered a vote bank for the Aam Aadmi Party
 isliye MCD chunaavon se unhen rijhaane kii jimmedaari bhi ab satyendra jain ke kandhon par aa gai he
 The important thing in this reshuffle is that till now the Urban Development Department used to handle Sisodia, who is considered to be Kejriwal's right hand, have Sisodia become weak in the government and Jain strong? Or is it something else? sisodiya ko nai jimmedaari!darasal, dilli sarkaar main jimmedaariyon kaa bantwaaraa bada rochak he
 Arvind Kejriwal, despite being the Chief Minister, did not keep any department with him from the beginning
 zyaadaatar vibhaag sisodiya ke jimme the, unamem vitt vibhaag bhi shaamil he
 However, Kejriwal's office used to come regularly and kept watching the work of CM
 is kaam main unki purv pradhan sachiv rajendra kumaar kii bhoomika ahm rahi
 However, as states like Punjab, Goa and Gujarat are preparing to spread their footsteps, Kejriwal is getting less time for Delhi
 ab tak bataur up mukhyamantri sisodiya kejariwal kii anupasthiti main unka kaam dekhte rahe hai
 But now that political responsibility has increased manifold on Kejriwal's shoulders, Sisodia is ready to hand over the entire responsibility of Delhi government
 yani mukhyamantri bhale kejariwal hi rahenge, lekin sisodiya ko upmukhyamantri ke saath hi kaaryakari mukhyamantri kii jimmedaari bhi dene par vichaar ho rahaa he

 jo saamne aayaa swaha ho gayiske lava kii chapet main aakar makaan, dukaan, khet or khaliyaan sab swaha ho gaye
 When the blazing lava came through this hill and forest on this road, the owner of this car ran away leaving it here to save his life
