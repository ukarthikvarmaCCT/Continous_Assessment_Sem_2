 Please tell that Atik Ahmed has filed a bail petition for a short time in Special Court to contest elections from Varanasi

 Statement of former MP Atiq's wife Shaista Parveen, wife of former MP, told reporters here on Sunday, 'on Saturday i went to meet Atiq Ahmed in Naini Central Jail and he expressed his desire to contest from Varanasi
 ’unhone bataaya ki sabhi party ke ummidavaaron ko dekhne ke baad aise prathit hota he ki sari partiyon ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko walk over de diya he
 If SP-BSP alliance, Congress sincerely wants to give a tough challenge to BJP candidate Narendra Modi, then why not all parties support Atik Ahmed
 parveen ne bataaya ki unke pati ne chunaav ke prachaar ke liye teen saptaah kii sashart jamaanat par rihaai kii arji court main di he, jis par 29 april ko nirnay hoga
 i have requested my husband Atik Ahmed that if there is any difficulty in getting bail due to any reason, he should reconsider to contest the election from jail

 Atiq's lawyers said that the former MP has obtained nomination papers to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Varanasi
 haalanki, jail main band hone ke chalate atik ke liye chunaav prachaar sambhav nahin hoga
 Therefore, a new application has been filed in the court and has sought bail for a short time

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special newzlator Units of the Indian Army and indo-tibetan Border Police (ITBP) have reported sightings of unidentified objects (ufos) flying in the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir
 pangong jhil ke kareeb thakung main tainaat itibipi kii unit ne is saal 1 agast se 15 aktubar ke bich kam-se-kam 100 baar prakaashmaan vastuon ke dekhe jane kii report bheji he
 In September, in his report sent to the Delhi Headquarters and the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), he said that ufos were seen there day and night
 pile se dikhne vaale ye prakaashiya pind china kii ore kshitij se uthte hai or teen se paanch ghante tak akaash main udaye ke baad kahin gaayab ho jate hai
 Indian military officials, after studying the blurred images of the ITBP, believe that these shells are neither unmanned aerial devices (uavs) nor drones or small satellites
 drone pahchaan main aa jaataa he or inkaa alag record rakhaa jaataa he
 The army has reported 99 Chinese drones seen between January and August this year: 62 of them were seen in Ladakh in the eastern sector and 37 in Arunachal Pradesh in the eastern sector
 inamen se teen drone ladakh main china se lagi 365 kimi lambii bhartiya seemaa main pravesh kar gaye the jahaan itibipi kii tainaati he
 In the past, such light bullets have been seen in Ladakh
 pakistan adhikrut kashmir or china adhikrut aksai chin ke bich 86,000 varg kimi main faile ladakh main sena kii baari tainaati he
 This year, there was a stir in the 14th Corps of Army at Leh due to the news that ITBP had seen such a light beam
 haalanki itibipi ne india today ke is sambandh main bheje gaye sawaalon kaa koi jawaab nahin diya he
 In September this year, the Army had installed a ground-based mobile radar unit on a mountain top close to the 160-km-long Pangang Lake, lying between India and China, ribbon-shaped
 yah radar kisi bhi vastu dwaara chodi jane vaali frequency ko pakadaaey ke kaam aata he
 The light which could be seen with the eyes could not come under the radar
 isse yah sabit hua ki in punjon main dhaatu nahin he
 The spectrum analyzer also could not catch any wave emanating from it
 is udati hui vastu kii disha main sena ne ek drone bhi choda, lekin usase bhi koi phayda nahin hua
 It did not help to identify it
 drone apni adhiktam oonchai tak to pahunch gaya lekin udate hue prakaash punj kaa pataa nahin laga sakaa
 In late September this year, scientists at the Indian Astronomical Center in Henley, 150 km south of the lake, investigated the aerial event for three days
 sainya adhikariyon ke mutabik, team ne prakaash punjon ko pahchaan to liya, lekin yah nahin bataa saki ki ve kya hai
 However, he definitely said that these objects are not "celestial" and have nothing to do with any planet or star
 haalanki vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki kashmir ghati ko ladakh se alag karne vaali vishaal himalay shrunkhlaa vaale is ilaake kii bhugolic jatilta or kam aabaadi ke kaaran aisi chijen dikhnaa aam hai
 Sunil Dhar, a geologist at the Government Post Graduate College in Dharamshala, says, "this place is snow-covered during winters, there are few roads and it falls in some of the cut off places in India
" ’’ dhar is ilaake main 15 saal tak glaciaron kaa adhyayan kar chuke hai
 Scientists at the National Technical Research Organization (NTRO) and the Defense Research Development Organization (DRDO) responsible for technical intelligence have also not been able to identify these items
 isse bhay kii jagah ab maamla sarkaar ke liye sharmindagi kii vajah banataa ja rahaa he
 a senior military officer in Delhi says, "if our scientific resources are not able to identify it, then there is something wrong
" ’’intelegence afasaron kaa maananaa he ki ho saktaa he ki china kii ore se yah koi manovaigyanik chaal ho yaa phir ucch takneekee upkaran jo ladakh main bharat kii samrik sthiti ko jaanchane ke liye lagaaya gaya ho

 Therefore, this appointment should be canceled
 rafaal maamle kii kahani 360 degree gum kar phir se vahiin pahunch gai he
 Did you hear that the defense ministry's committee, under the chairmanship of the first prime minister, should pass the deal with the conditions, after a few days, the defense ministry committee should remove those conditions
 11 farvari ko da hindu akhbaar main en ram ne jo khulaasa kiya he or uske samarthan main jo dastauez chaape hai wo bataa rahe hai ki rafaal deal main sab kuch paak-saaf nahin he
 You may remember that on 8 February, n Ram also reported
 usase alag 11 farvari kii report kai sawaalon ko uthaati he
 Under the Defense Procurement Procedure 2013, it was decided that there would be Integrity Clause for all types of defense purchases
 yani agar deal main shaamil company baahar se dabaav dalavaaegi, agent yaa agency ko yaa uske zarie rishwat degi to use dand diya jayega
 Ann Ram's report states that this clause was removed from the Rafale deal
 sawaal uthta he ki koi bhi sarkaar is tarah kii shart ko kyon hatwanaa chaahegi
 N
 Ram has written that the Government of India exempted both the French companies Dasso and MBDA France from this condition
 is baat ko lekar indian negoceating team ke teen bade adhikari em pi singh, e aar sule or rajeev varna ne kadi aapatti jataai or likhaa ki bhrashtachar virdohi praavdhaan hataa dene se jo commercial saplir hai unase sidhe bijness kaa rasta khul jaataa he
 When the procurement is going on between the two governments then how can the French government avoid its accountability on these companies
 jab france sarkaar javabdehi nahin legi tab phir do sarkaron ke bich deal kaa kya matlab rah jaataa he
 Not only this, all three officials write that doing so is to compromise the basic conditions of financial honesty which will not be appropriate
 bhartiya baatcheet dal ke teen adhikari sadsy likhte hai ki aisa karnaa vittiya eemaandaaree kii buniyadi sharto se samjhauta karnaa hoga
 What kind of a deal is it that officials from the Defense Secretary to the Indian negotiating team are raising questions at different levels
 8 farvari kii report main aapane dekha tha ki raksha sachiv sahit kai adhikari file par likh rahe hai ki pradhanmantri kaa karyaalay apane str par shaamil ho gaya he
 The Ministry of Defense has started talking to France without informing them, due to which their bargaining ability is being affected
 ab 11 farvari kii report or bhi gambhir sawaal khadey karti he
 On August 24, 2016, the Cabinet Committee on Defense meets
 is baithak kii adhyakshata pradhanmantri narend modi karte hai
 This is followed by a meeting of the Defense Purchasing Council in September 2016
 isaki adhyakshata raksha mantri manohar parrikar karte hai
 Eight conditions are removed at this meeting
 jisamen bhrashtachar nirodhak praavdhaan ko bhi hataaya jaataa he
 The agreement between India and France is signed on 23 September 2016
 ajay shukla ne abhi saaf kiya ki aisa kab hota he ki jin sharton par pradhanmantri kii cameti deal ko manzuri detii he, use raksha mantralay kii cameti hataa detii he
 Should the government still want to claim transparency, should it not explain why the terms of non-corruption were removed from the Rafale deal
 kya aisa kisi tarah se len-dein kaa rasta banane ke liye kiya gaya tha
 After all, why did the Dasso Company and the arms supply company get concessions to MBDA France with anti-corruption conditions
 en ram ne iske saath hi ek or khulaasa kiya he
 The French government did not want to give a guarantee on its behalf
 bank guarantee bhi nahin dena chaahati thi
 It was then suggested by the Ministry of Defense that an escrow account be created
 matlab france sarkaar ke paas khaataa ho, bharat sarkaar us khate main paisa daalegi or france kii companiyon ko paise kaa bhugtan kiya jayega
 But this proposal was also sidelined
 koi bhi sarkaar kyon is tarah kii deal karnaa chaahegi ki hamaara paisa aap le len magar hamen aapse koi guarantee nahin chahie
 Letter of comfort received but not legal status
 en ram ne sudhanshu mohanti kaa ek note chapa he
 Sudhanshu Mohanty was the financial advisor to the Defense Service at that time
 akhbaar ne sudhanshu mohanti ke note kii copy bhi chhap di he
 In which he writes that i wish i had enough time to consider the entire files and all the issues
 ab chunki raksha mantri ko file turant hi chahie isliye main vittiya nazariye se kuch baaten rakhana chahta hum
 Now you remember the report of 8 February
 jo note da hindu ne prakashit kiya tha us par raksha mantri manohar parrikar ke hastakshar 11 janvari 2016 ke hai
 On November 24, 2015, three officers objected for the first time
 ek maheene se adhik samay ke baad raksha mantri likhte hai ki pradhanmantri karyaalay deal kii monitering kar rahaa he
 You people should talk to their Principal Secretary to resolve the matter
 raksha mantri yah nahin likhte hai, aapke uthaae sawaal galat hai
 Sudhanshu Mohanty's note dated January 14 means three days later
 raksha mantri jis file par sin karne main ek maheene se adhik samay laga dete hai, teen din main aisa kya ho gaya ki sudhanshu mohanti jo ki vittiya salaahkaar hai unhen file padhane kaa puraa vakt hi nahin mila
 Sudhanshu Mohanty suggests, in a hurry, that when neither bank guarantee is coming nor government guarantee is coming, then how will the interests of the government be protected in such a situation
 sarkaar ke khate se kisi bhi agrim bhugtan ko bank guarantee milani chahie
 We should be cautious that this may increase costs
 isliye bank guarantee ke saath laagat or bina bank ganrti ke saath laagat kaa prastaav maangana chahie
 Sudhanshu Mohanty is clearly writing that the French government should be involved in giving money
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki ek escro acount bane
 This account is under the control of the Government of France
 bharat sarkaar us khate main paisa jamaa kare or vahaan se paisa in companiyon ko diya jaae
 By doing this, the French government becomes morally accountable in this deal
 us par supplai sunishchit karaane main bhi javabdehi aa jaati he
 Who benefited from ignoring such advice, the question arises
 kyon aisi vyavastha jisamen bharat kaa paisa surakshit rahe, hataa di gai
 We spoke to Sudhanshu Mohanty, who is also constantly writing about the matter, but after talking about his noting, he explained what his side was and what should have happened
 sudhanshu mohanti bhi kah rahe hai ki jab desh ke bheetar kii company se sarkaar karidati he to bhi bank guarantee leti he, phir baahar ke mulk se jab samjhauta hota he to bina bank guarantee ke kaise ho saktaa he
 This revelation of n Ram did not stir the way it was reported from the February 8 report
 tab raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman loksabhaa main bhi boleen or baahar bhi boleen
 Also talked to the media separately
 11 farvari kii report phir se bada sawaal uthaati he ki is deal se bhrashtachar kii sthiti main sazaa nahin di jaaegi, ye kiske phaayde ke liye sunishchit kiya gaya
 Have you ever heard such a deal in which the condition is removed that if the case of bribe is caught, then penalty will be given
 is bich da hindu akhbaar ke associat editor vargeez ke jorge ne shuukravaar ko apane akhbaar main rafaal saude se judi story ko sahi tehraaya he
 He also gave his reasoning for not printing the hand-written note of the then Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar in a note related to the Rafale deal in The Hindu newspaper

 The Chennai team lost wickets at regular intervals and was never in a position to achieve the target

 The Superkings, who were chasing the target, had a poor start and lost the wicket of Dwayne Smith on the fourth ball of the innings, which Malinga lbw

 unhone 15 gend main 20 ran banaae
 Chennai Super Kings needed 67 runs to win in the last five overs
 vinay kumaar ne iske baad pawan negi (03) jabaki maclenaghan ne ravindra jadeja (19) ko pavilion bhejkar superkings kii rahi sahi ummid bhi tod di

 malinga ne ashish nehra ko simons ke haathon kaich karake chennai kii pari kaa ant kiya
 Earlier, Simmons scored 65 off 51 balls with the help of five sixes and three fours, besides 10 for the first wicket with Parthiv Patel (35)

 'singh said,' there are 306 such Indian students

 Mexico are in second place after Sweden with three points in a match in group-f and now have a chance to advance to the next round
 vahiin dakshin korea ko apane pehle match main sweden se 0-1 se shikast jhelni padi thi, jisaki badaulat team group main sabase neeche chauthe number par he
 Mexico has performed better than expected in the tournament so far and has shocked the world by beating Germany
 germany or mexico ke mukaable main kisi ko ummid nahin thi ki mexico kuch aisa pradarshan karegi
 But Mexico, with their 22-year-old player Hervig Lozano, scored the only goal in the 35th minute, opened the account with a win in the competition
 saal 1985 ke baad se mexico kii germany ke khilaaf yah pehali jeet he
 Mexico has never lost their second match in the World Cup since the 1978 World Cup in Argentina
 team chaahegi ki vah korea ke khilaaf bhi apane is record ko kaayam rakhen
 Mexico and Korea are facing each other for the second time in the World Cup
 donon timen 20 saal pehle france main saal 1998 main pehali baar bhide the, jab mexico ne korea ko 3-1 se karaari shikast di thi
 Mexico will try to compete against Korea with a psychological edge

 The 30-year-old Hanardes has scored the most goals for his country so far and Mexico will be expected to score goals against Korea as well
 korea ke khilaaf hone vaale mukaable main mexico ko isliye bhi jeet kaa daavedaar mana ja rahaa he, kyonki mexico kii team world cap ke itihaas main kabhi bhi asian tiimon se nahin haari he
 However, records are made to be broken and South Korea would like it to be meaningful
 duusari taraf world cap main dakshin korea kaa record sahi nahin rahaa he
 Since returning to the World Cup in Mexico in 1986, South Korea have never won their second match in the tournament

 The team will have high hopes from their star midfielder Sunghyung who will go on to play his 104 matches

 haalanki team chaahegi ki asia kii anya tiimon kii jeet se unki team prerana le or mexico ke khilaaf kuch nayaa kare
 Korea's defensive midfielder Jung Woo Young has also reiterated this

 Jaitley also said that the real challenge today is to accelerate investment, focus on infrastructure and bring about massive improvements in manufacturing
 unhone kaha, mujhe lagata he ki samay aa gaya he ki agle charan main pravesh karen, jahaan ham in lakshyon main teji laaen, jo arthvyavastha ke phir se utthan ke liye jaruri he
 Jaitley said at an event of ICICI Bank, the coming days are going to be very thrilling

 The Finance Minister said that as more and more people use the rupay Debit Card, a large part of economic activity which is outside the banking net will be reflected in GDP (GDP)
 haal ke samay main duniya main china sabase teji se aarthik vruddhi hasil karne vaala desh rahaa he

 The opposition was continuously attacking the silence of PM Modi and today the Prime Minister also broke the silence on this
 piem kii tarah anya mantri bhi is prakaran par saamne aane lage hai
 Particularly as people get to know about the Kathuaki incident in detail how the 8-year-old was tortured with an innocent girl, the anger of the people is increasing
 brihaspativaar kii raat dilli main is ghatana ke virodh main rahul gandhi, priyanka wadra ke march ke baad sarkaar par dabaav or bad gaya he
 Finally, PM Modi spoke for the first time on both events during a program on Friday
 unhone kaha ki aisi ghatnaon se puraa desh sharmasaar he
 Justice will be given to the daughters
 nyaay dilaanaa hamaari jimmedaari he
 He further said that the kind of incidents which we have seen in the past, challenge the concept of social justice
 kisi bhi sabhy samaaj ke liye yah sharmnaak he
 As a society, as a country, we are all ashamed of it
 isse pehlerahul gandhi shuukravaar ko bhi twit karke modi kii chuppi par tanj kasate hue kaha ki desh is baat kaa intjaar kar rahaa he ki pradhanmantri apni chuppi kab todate hai or unhen is sawaal par unke jawaab kaa intjaar he ki hatya or balaatkaar ke aropiyon ko rajya sarkarein kyon bachaane main lagi hai
 Ministers also had to speak
 Increasing pressure has the effect that even the ministers of the Modi government, who had avoided speaking on this incident till two days ago, are now making statements against it
 shuukravaar ko grahamantri rajnath singh ne is maamle par apni chuppi todate hue kaha ki peedit parivaar ko nyaay milanaa chahie
 The Minister of Women and Child Development Maneka Gandhi, through a video message, said that her ministry will take a proposal for a change in the law to make provision for capital punishment for raping girls below 12 years of age
 apana dal kii netaa or modi sarkaar main mantri anupriya patel ne bhi menka gandhi kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki jo log is tarah se bacchon ke saath balaatkaar jaise ghrunit aparaadh karte hai, unki tulana sirf kisi jaanavar or rakshas se hi kii ja sakati he
 He said that fear of the law will sit in the mind of such people only when there will be a provision of severe punishment for this which includes hanging
 unhone kaha ki poxo act main badlaav kaa faisla sambandhit mantralay ko karnaa he lekin ek mahila mantri hone ke naate vah iskaa puraa samarthan karti hai
 Uma Bharti also said that the convicts in both Unnao and Kathua will be punished
 amethi main smriti irani ne kaha ki pehle rahul gandhi balaatkaar ke aaropee gayatri prajapati ke saath khadey the, lekin ab candil march nikaalnaa unki majaburi he
 One of the first ministers to speak on Kathua's case was VK Singh, who said that he is so sad that this person has started to look like a abusive person
 sarkaar ke mantriyon ke badale ruukh kaa ek kaaran ye bhi he ki unnav or kathua donon maamalon main adaalaton ne bhi kadaa ruukh dikhaaya he
 Expressing strong objection to the attitude of the lawyers in Jammu on the Kathua case, the Supreme Court said that they cannot be an obstacle in the way of justice
 vahiin unnav ke maamle ko lekar elahabaad hoicourt ne aaropee vidhayak kii giraftaar nahin karne ko lekar rajya sarkaar ko fatkaar lagaai

 southampton test main england ne team india ko 266 ranon se karaari shikast di
 Team India's batting collapsed against the huge score of 445 runs given by England and the entire team returned to the pavilion for a total of only 178 runs
 is match main haar ke saath hi 5 test maichon kii shrinkhalaa main donon timen 1-1 se barabari par aa gai hai
 India got the final shock as Pankaj Singh
 pankaj ko bhi moin ali ne hi chalata kiya
 Pankaj scored 9 runs
 agar donon pariyon ko dekhen to england kii jeet main james anderson or moin ali kii gendbaaji kaa mahatvapurn yogadan rahaa
 While Anderson took 7 wickets in both innings, Ali had 8 wickets
 ali ne duusari pari main 6 bhartiya ballebaajon ko chalata kar apni team kii jeet sunishchit kii
 It is one of India's biggest defeats based on England's run at home but it is not their worst defeat
 unhen 2011 main pichley daure ke dauraan nottigham main test match main 319 ran ke vishaal score se paraajay mili thi
 For England, this win means that it has broken a disappointing rhythm of not winning a single match in 10 Tests since the Ashes series
 vahiin is haar main bharat ke liye apmaan kii baat yah rahi ki kaamchalau of spinner moin ali ne nichle kram ko tahas nahas kiya or apane kariyar kaa sarvshereshth pradarshan karte hue 20
 Won six wickets for 67 runs in 4 overs
 tej gendbaaj jimi anderson ne subah pehla jhatka diya, jab unhone rohit sharma (06) ko baahar jaati gend par wicketiper jose butler ke haathon kaich out karaayaa
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni (06) could not show the same spirit as the first innings and he once again became the victim of outswinger and touched the bat and reached the pavilion by catching the wicketkeeper
 anjiky rahane (naabad 52) ekmaatr khilaadi rahe jo ek chor par date the, lekin vah zyada kuch nahin kar sake kyonki duusare chor par lagaataar wicket girane kaa silsilaa jari rahaa
 For England, Ali was in rhythm, he turned the ball and bowled classical off-break
 unhone ravindra jadeja (15) ko bold kiya or unke of stump ukhaad diye
 Bhuvneshwar Kumar was caught out on a ball that was spinning after pitching, his catch was caught by Anderson
 ali ke paanch wicket mohammad shami ko out karne ke saath puure hue jinhen unhone of brake par pavilion bheja
 Rahane completed his second half-century in the match, completing 50 runs off the brilliant square driver off Chris Woakes
 tab unke saath 11wein number ke ballebaaj pankaj singh maujuud the
 But Ali soon got Pankaj out and got his sixth wicket
 ab donon timen chauthe cricket test ke liye manchester ravaanaa hongi jahaan old traverd par saat agast se yah muqabla shuru hoga
 India made 24 of their last six wickets in just 66 runs on the final day
 4 over main ganvaa die
 Ali took four wickets for 17 runs off 22 balls, taking the wickets of Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli on the fourth day
 rahane 121 gend main saat chauke se 52 ran banaakar naabad rahe, vah bharat ke is niraashajanak pradarshan ke dauraan sanyamit ballebaaji karne vaale ekmaatr khilaadi rahe
 James Anderson was again chosen Man of the Match for his brilliant performance in the match on a pitch that took seven wickets for 77 runs which was not suited for fast and swing bowling
 unki kal ravindra jadeja ke saath kathith jhadap ke liye isisi ke samaksh sunwaayee hogi
 Stuart Broad (no wickets for 22), Chris Jordan (no wickets for 22), Chris Woakes (no wickets for 23) may not have got wickets but they definitely kept the pressure on the Indian batsmen
 
 bharat ke liye antim din keval ek baar saajhedaari bani jab rahane or jadeja ne saatven wicket ke liye 32 ran kii bhagidaari nibhaai
 This led to the Indian team crossing the 150-run mark in the 59th over, although this score did not matter then
 iske baad ali gendbaaji ke liye utre or unhone nichle kram ko tabah kar diya
 For Dhoni, the performance of his chief spinner Ravindra Jadeja may be a matter of concern, with 106 in his three Tests
 8 (kareeb 18 over) ke strike rate se keval aath wicket hai jabaki ali england ke frontline spinner bhi nahin he or vah anderson ke baad 15 wicket se duusare sthaan par hai
 In the last two years, Kohli, the key player of Indian batting, has been one of the biggest disappointments in this current tour, so far he has scored only 101 runs in six complete innings and his best score is 39 runs
 test visheshgy cheteshwar pujaara kaa pradarshan unase jaraa sa behatar rahaa he, unhone chah pariyon main 190 ran jode hai jisamen duusari pari main banaaya gaya ek ardhashatak bhi shaamil he
 Time is passing for left-handed opener Shikhar Dhawan, who has collected 122 runs
 ishanth sharma chauthe test ke liye bhi uplabdh nahin ho paaenge jisase captain dhoni ko nishchit rup se antim ekadash chunane ke maamle main kaaphi soch vichaar karnaa hoga

 ISIS, considered to be the most dreaded terrorist organization in the world, is engaged in vigorous efforts to spread its foot in India
 kashmir se lekar dakshin bharat ke kai rajyon tak IS apni jaden jamaane ke liye har sambhav koshishen kar chukaa he
 As a result, from time to time, security agencies have prevented the is-inspired youth from going astray
 vahiin darjanon bhartiya yuva IS kii sultanate barkaraar rakhane ke liye iraq or syria main lagaataar videshi phujon se jang lard rahe hai
 The documents associated with the is-terror Blue-print, which India India Group has got, clearly shows that IS is trying to implement its sordid gameplan by engaging the youth in the Kashmir Valley
 IS ne ghati main sena ke khilaaf khatarnakgorilla yudhbhadakaane kii koshish kii he
 Significantly, even before this, IS has tried its best to include the youth of South India in its camp
 telugana, kerala, andhra pradesh, tamilnadu, karnataka, maharashtra or madhya pradesh (haal hi main saamne aae khurasaan modul) main darjanon yuvaaon ke IS se prerit hokar shaamil hone kii khabaren pehle bhi aa chuki hai
 Security agencies have been monitoring and counseling dozens of confused youth and have brought them on the right path

 At the same time, there are some youngsters who have left the country to join IS by cheating their family and police
 samay-samay par unke maare jane kii suchanaaen bhi mili hai
 Let us tell you that IS has adopted many tricks to include Indian youth in its court
 unke liye yuvaaon kaa brain wash karne kaa sabase behatar tarikasoshal mediabana
 Through social media, he sent videos related to war, atrocities and atrocities in the minds of the youth
 jehad, islamic callyphat ke ek chhatra raaj se judi baaten, sex slave aadi pralobhanon kii baat kii gai
 Due to the vigilance of security agencies, many conspiracies of IS have been foiled in the country
 magar ek baar phir ghati main IS kii maujuudagi ne ehsaas dilaa diya he ki IS aatanki islamic callyphat ke liye kahin bhi or kisi bhi had tak ja sakate hai
 You have been in a relationship for the last several years
 har baat aap apane saathi ke saath baantate hai
 Whether it is love filled moments in the bed or spend two moments of comfort in a park, both of them give you equal feelings
 lekin kya kabhi aisa bhi hua he ki kisi raat aap un par ji bharke pyaar lutaanaa chaahate hon or vah ‘aaj nahin’ jaisaa jawaab dekar aap se dur ho jaati hai
 Initially these situations are very less, but often the bed fills sighs without folds
 agar aapaki saathi bhi aksar pyaar karne se inkaar kar detii hai, to hataash na hon yaa phir khud main kamiyaan na talaashen
 There can be some other reason behind this, so instead of getting desperate, find out what is the matter
 kuch baaten jo swaabhaavik si hai, ve ham aapako bataa dete hai
 Diabetes can also happen because you are unaware of it, but diabetes can also be a reason for your partner's apathy towards love, so take time out of your busy life as soon as possible to get their diabetes level tested
 hai blad sugar mahilaon main charmotkarsh ko paane main rukaawat paidaa karata he, jisase ve bistar par aapke saath pyaar ke palon main khone ke baajaae aapse katnaa shuru kar detii hai
 Actually, the reality is that after diabetes, those moments of love for women become painful, not pleasant
 hormones main asantulanmahilaon ko umr ke kai padaavon par hormonal badlaavon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Many changes make women indifferent
 agar ye badlaav sahi hone kii bajaae galat hon, to kisi bhi mahila ko bistar ke un palon se koson dur kar sakate hai, jo unhen ek adbhut anubhav detaa he
 Stay away from stress Too much stress can affect your relationship not only in the bed but also beyond it, so make sure that your partner does not go under any kind of stress for too long

 This morning when the Indian Air Force entered Pakistan and carried out a 21-minute operation in response to the attack on Central Security Force personnel on 14 February in Pulwama

 'kshamashil ho ripu-samakshatum hue vineet jitna hi,dusht kauravon ne tumkokayar samajha utana hi

 This is the problem of tolerating atrocities, the person of the masculine loses by being manujkomal
 kshamaa shobhati us bhujang ko,jiske paas garal ho
 What to him, who is toothless, odorless, unobtrusive, simple? For three days, he sought the path and sat on the banks of the Indus, and continued to read the verses of his beloved
 uttar main jab ek naad bhiutha nahin sagar se,uthi adheer dadhak paurush kiaag ram ke shar se
 Indus deh dhar "trāhi-trāhī" used to fall into asylum, worshiped Charan, took up slavery, tied in foolish bondage
 sach pucho to shar main hibasati he dipti vinay kisandhi-vachan sampoojya usee kajisamen shakti vijay kii
 Tolerance is forgiveness, mercy, and worship is awakened, the strength flashes back when it shines

 Drinking gum-sip is Kamis, the trick of speech

 ab tak pradhanmantri narendra modi, bijepi adhyaksh amit shah aurcongressdhyaksh rahul gandhi ke liye chunavi abhiyaan kaa kaam kar chuke prashanth kishor ne ek kshetreey dal ko hi apni siyaasi lonching ke liye kyon chunaa? yah bada prashn he
 Because if they wanted, they could start with any national party
 darasal is sawaal main hi iskaa jawaab chipa he
 Prashant Kishore, who was an important part of Narendra Modi's campaign from the 2012 Gujarat assembly elections to the 2014 general elections, had an ambition that he should have a role in the policy decisions of the government after the formation of the Modi government
 lekin is mudde par party adhyaksh amit shah se matbhed ke baad kishor ne apana rasta badal liya or tab modi ke dhur virodhinithish kumaarake saath jud gaye
 At the same time, despite working in UP and Punjab with the Congress, the party leaders did not allow them to work independently
 nitish ke saath prashanth isliye sahaj hai kyonki prashanth kii tarah nitish bhi yah dikhaa chuke hai ki mauka padane par congress or bijepi dono ke saath kaam karne main unhen koi gurej nahin hoga
 Nitish Kumar joined Lalu Yadav and Congress in 2013, leaving the NDA in the name of anti-modi and started talking about a Sangh Mukt Bharat
 phir raturaat argedy or congress kaa saath chhodkar phir se bijepi ke saath aate hue endie kaa hissaa ho gaye
 Recently at an event at the Indian Business School in Hyderabad, Prashant Kishore said that he was in touch with both Congress President Rahul Gandhi and BJP President Amit Shah
 isi kaarykram main unhone kisi bhi tarah kii dalgat raajnneeti main aane se saaf inkaar kar diya tha
 But a week later, Prashant Kishor Nejeduka Daman Tham shocked everyone
 lokin wo raajnneetijna hi kya jiske dil kii baat jubaan par aa jaae
 a similar resilience makes Prashant Kishore closer to Nitish Kumar
 jis tarah se ek lohiavaadi nitish kumaar congress or bijepi donon ke saath sahaj hai, thik isi tarah se prashanth kishor bhi kisi tarah kii patibaddhta se bandhana pasand nahin karte
 Along with this, they do not get that freedom in big parties like Congress and BJP
 nitish kumaar kii jediu main jo hai wo nitish hi hai
 After gaining the trust of Nitish, Prashant Kishore has no challenge in the party
 jediu ke saath judane ke baad prashanth ne endie kheme main apni maujuudagi darj kara lee he
 Some people say that Prashant Kishor will finally be seen campaigning for Narendra Modi in 2019
 lekin pichley kuch ghatnakramon par gaur karen to nitish or prashanth kishor donon ne mauka padane par apni raajnneetik chaturaai kaa bhi parichay diya he
 There is no doubt that Prashant Kishore's high profile entry in the JDU has raised questions on leaders and hierarchies (political hierarchies) within the party
 saath hi party main is baat ko lekar utsaah bhi he ki prashanth jediu main nai urja kaa sanchaar karenge
 Prashant Kishore too will not be intent on being limited as a JDU leader, because till now he has been known to take a big lead
 aaj tak se baatcheet main nitish kumaar ko prashanth kishor main bhavishya dikhataa he
 But in the coming times in Bihar inspired by the politics of Mandal, Prashant Kishore, who is a Brahmin, will have to face great challenges
 kyonki jaateey pahchaan kii raajnneeti haaavee hone ke baad se bihar main 1989 ke baad koi brahman raajnneetik shikhar par nahin pahunchaa

 Due to this statement of Manjhi, there has been a political debate in the state before the upcoming by-election on August 21 on 10 assembly seats in Bihar
 jediu ke nae saathi argedy or congress ne kaha he ki maanjhi ke us bayaan se ve sahamat nahin hai or yah jediu kii raay he na ki gathbandhan (jediu, argedy or congress) kii

 abhi tak 7 res course road ko piem nivas ke naam se janaa jaataa tha lekin ab ye '7 lok kalyaan maarg' ke naam se janaa jayega
 This decision was taken unanimously in NDMC
 darasal hamaare piem res course road par rahete hai lekin bijepi saansad or endiemasi sadsy minakshi lekhi ne pehle endiemasi main is sadak kaa naam 'ekatm maarg' rakhane kaa prastaav diya tha
 But after coming to the meeting, he changed his proposal and proposed to keep the public welfare route
 baithak kii adhyakshata kar rahe siem kejariwal ne is sadak kaa naam shri guru gobind singh maarg rakhane kaa prastaav rakhaa
 The majority was in favor of the BJP, so it was unanimously decided to name the road as Lok Kalyan Marg

 lekin jab charchaa sabaki hui to bahumat is baat par tha ki iskaa naam lok kalyaan maarg rakhaa jaae
 Comments minakshi lekhi ne kaha ki 'pehle hamaara prastaav tha ki kyonki res course road piem ke liye adarsh pataa nahin ho saktaa isaliye iskaa naam badalakar ekatm maarg kiya jaae
 But after the news came in the media, the suggestions of the people came and the main suggestion was that the address of PM Niwas should be the public welfare route, then we proposed to keep the public welfare route

 Actually our PM lives on Race Course Road but BJP MP and NDMC member Meenakshi Lekhi had earlier proposed to name this road 'ekatam Marg' in NDMC
 lekin meeting main aakar unhone apana prastaav badla or lok kalyaan maarg rakhane kaa prastaav rakhaa
 CM Kejriwal, who is presiding over the meeting, proposed to name this road as Shri Guru Gobind Singh Marg
 bahumat bijepi ke paksh main tha isliye sarvasammati se is sadak kaa naam lok kalyaan maarg rakhane kaa faisla hua
 Arvind Kejriwal said that 'meenakshi ji proposed that the race course road should be named as Lok Kalyan Marg
 mere paas bhi sikh sanghathan aaye the or unka naam guru gobind singh ji ke naam par rakhaa, ye maang kar rahe the kyonki ye unka 350waan prakashotsav he
 But when it was discussed, the majority was on the idea that it should be named Lok Kalyan Marg
 ' tippaniyan Meenakshi Lekhi said that earlier our proposal was that because the Race Course Road cannot be the ideal address for PM, it should be renamed to Integral Road
 lekin media main khabar aane ke baad logon ke suzav aaye or pramukh suzav tha ki piem nivas kaa pataa lok kalyaan maarg hona chahie to hamane lok kalyaan maarg rakhane kaa prastaav rakhaa

 The BJP had to step back a bit and bring in another name which was accepted

 This year when the BJP announced an additional compensation of five lakh rupees to the Sikh riot victims of Delhi
 tab 'aap' party ne kaaphi ho-hallaa machaaya tha, khaskar isaki timming ko lekar

 About 2633 Sikh riot victims are to be compensated in Delhi, but in a hurry, Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday gave a check of five lakhs to 17 victims
 saath hi danga peediton kii samasya sulajhane ke liye ek cameti kaa bhi gathan kiya he
 Rajnath Singh himself says that money is not going to ease the pain of Sikh riot victims, but how to get justice, whether such riot victims will become old-fashioned with children walking around the doorpost of the courts

 Tendai Chatara of Zimbabwe was reprimanded on Saturday during the first day of the only Test against South Africa in Harare after admitting a violation of Level 1 offense of the ICC Code of Conduct

 3 ke ulanghan kaa doshi paaya gaya jo antarrashtriya match ke dauraan ampire ke faisle ke virodh se sambandhit he
 The incident occurred in the 83rd over of Zimbabwe's innings when Chatara was caught out behind the wicket
 chataara ne iske baad sir hilaate hue out hone se inkaar kiya or pavilion lautate hue apane pair kii ore ishaara kiya
 Young batsman Virat Kohli strengthened his claim for the first Test match against Australia by playing a vigorous half-century innings and lifted India from the early tremors in a rain-affected practice match against Cricket Australia President XI
 barish ke kaaran is teen divasiy match ke pehle din keval 50 over kaa khel hi ho paaya
 India scored 162 for four at the end of the day's play
 kohli ab bhi 55 ran banaakar khel rahe hai, jabaki bhartiya ballebaaji linep main unke saath chathe sthaan ke duusare daavedaar rohit sharma 38 ran banaakar krij par hai
 India's score at one time was 84 for four wickets, after which both of them have added 78 runs for the fifth wicket
 bharat ke anbhavi ballebaaj virendra sahvaag (12), gautam gambhir (24) or vivies lakshmana (15) zyada der tak nahin tik paae, jabaki ajinkya rahane (15) bhi chayankartaaon ko prabhavit karne main naakaam rahe
 Australia's left-arm young fast bowler Jason Berndorf greatly troubled the Indian batsmen
 unhone ab tak nau over main aath ran dekar ek wicket liya he
 The game started only after lunch due to rain on Sunday night
 bhartiya team ne toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karte hue sahvaag kaa wicket jald hi ganvaa diya
 He played a Peter George ball towards the street, where Alex Doolan converted it into a beautiful catch slightly above the ground
 iske baad jab khel shuru hua, to jose lalore ne pehle over main hi rahane ko osman khwaja ke haathon kaich kara diya
 Gambhir, who was unbeaten with him at the time of the game stopped due to rain, could not increase his previous score like Rahane and returned to the pavilion after being bowled by the ball of Berndorf
 berndorf kii gend isse pehle gambhir kii anguliyon par bhi lagi thi, jisase vah dard se karaah uthe the
 He immediately had to seek medical help for this
 unhen iske alaava dag bolinger or george ne bhi kuch avasaron par pareshaan kiya
 Laxman, who always dominated the Australian bowlers, batted well initially and in the meantime did not fall for 12 overs
 yah kalatmak ballebaaj haalanki baayen haath ke spinner jon holland ke jaal main funs gaya, jinhone unki gilliyaan bikheri
 By then the pitch had lost moisture and Kohli took full advantage of it and took some attractive shots
 unhone ab tak apni pari main 10 chauke lagaae hai, jabaki rohit ne paanch chauke or ek chakka jamaaya he
 Meanwhile, all eyes are on the Indian fast bowling leader Zaheer Khan, who is returning after being out for five months due to injury
 bhartiya team ne is match ke liye jin 13 khilaadiyon ko chunaa he, unamem sachin tendulkar or rahul dravid tathaa tej gendbaaj ishanth sharma or vinay kumaar shaamil nahin hai
 This is not a first-class match and both teams can use 13–13 players, but only 11 players will be able to bat

 apane chat sho ke jariye dusron se khulaase karwaane vaale karan johar khud hi intervyuuj main khulaase kar rahe hai
 Recently, he opened a secret related to his film Ae Dil Hai Mushkil that created a ruckus on social media
 karan ne bataaya ki i dil he mushkil main anoushka sharma ke kirdaar ko film main isliye maranaa padaa, kyonki ye ranbir ke kirdaar ko pyaar na karne kii uski sajaa thi
 Let me tell you that Ae Dil Hai Mushkil is the story of one sided love
 ayaan (ranbir kapur) eliz (anoushka) ko pyaar karata he, lekin elize vahi feeling ayaan ke liye mahasoos nahin karti
 She dies of cancer
 karan ne uski maut ke peeche kii kahani bataai
 The audience did not like this answer of Karan
 iske baad unhen soshal media par trol kiya jane laga
 Please tell that Fawad Khan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan were also seen in this film
 shahrukh khan kii film main guest entry hoti he
 @karanjoharsaid this during an interview, about a female character that he killed off: “he loved her so crazily
 She could’ve loved him back, why couldn’t she? So she got cancer and she died
 "ladies, don't DARE to reject men
" You'll get cancer and you'll die
 😁 # nomeansno — Preeti (@preetideshpa) January 25, 2019karan Johar saying he killed Anushka in Ae Dil Hai Mushkil to punish her is the most unsurprising and fucked up thing I've read today

 com / 3ezeplve7v— Sonia Mariam Thomas (@sokneeoh)january 24, 2019karan Johar saying he killed off Alizeh in ADHM because she didn’t love Ayan and chalking it off as karma is disgusting because we still live in a day and age where women are constantly attacked or killed for not reciprocating feelings and we are NOT going to romanticize that— sai (@saisailu97)january 24, 2019people are (unfortunately) VERY influenced by movies and copy the things they see on screen
 This absolutely vile justification of a woman dying because she did not love a man would do nothing but encourage men in real life to act the same
 — sai (@saisailu97)january 24, 2019I always found Karan Johar weird but his recent interview states that he isn't just that but crazy and full of himself! Killing a character just coz she didn't love the male lead back?! And it's all coming from a personal experience?? Kya dimaag hai bhai— -jas- (@jasisamess)january 25, 2019karan ne intervyuu main kaha- film ke last treks ko kaaphi mila-jula rispons mila
 But i think Anushka's character was to die, she does not love Ayan
 maine is kirdaar ko likhaa tha
 Ayan loves her by drowning, but she does not get that love in return
 isliye sajaa ke taur par cancer kaa shikaar hokar maranaa padaa
 The audience did not like Karan's response to this character
 ek yujar ne likhaa he use isliye maranaa padaa, kyonki vah use pyaar nahin karti thi
 Women do not dare to reject a man
 nahin to aapako cancer ho jayega or aap mar jaaogi
 Another wrote - Therefore Karan killed her character because she did not love a man in return
 ye sab personal life ke anubhav se aata he, kya dimag he
 Please tell that Karan Johar was also in controversies due to his chat show
 unke sho coffee vid karan main cricketer keel rahul or hardik pandya ne vivaadit bayaan die the
 Karan has expressed regret over this
 reliance jeeyo or beasenel ke aane vaale 149 rupee ke analimited plan ke baad ab airsel ne 148 rupee kaa plan launch kiya he
 Under this, unlimited local STD voice calling will be available for 90 days, but the screw is that only Aircel will be on the network
 iske alaava iske saath 500MB data bhi diya jayega
 But there is also an complication in this, because for this you may have to pay more than Rs 148 and you will get 2G internet only
 FRC 148 naam kaa airsel kaa yah plan philhal yah dilli ensiaar ke liye hi he
 Under this, 250 minutes of free calling has been given from Aircel to other networks for up to 90 days
 is ofer ko lene ke liye pehla richarge 148 rupee se karana hoga, duusare or tisare maheene free colling ke liye customer ko kam se kam 50 rupee kaa richarge karana hoga
 Whether 50 rupees for talk time or for taking data
 saadhaaran shabdon main kahen to aapako is plan ke liye total 248 rupee dene honge
 Call charge 0 at the end of minutes of another network within 90 days
 30 rupee prati minute kii dar se dene honge
 Apart from free calling, customers will get unlimited 2G data for a month
 data caping 500MB he jo jaldi hi khatm ho saktaa he
 One more thing to note is that this data will be available only in the first month, the data will not be available from the next month
 ise dekhakar to yahi lagata he ki abhi tak reliance jeeyo ko kaayade se takkar koi nahin da rahaa he

 An RTI reply from the Ganga Rejuvenation Ministry to India Today has revealed that pollution in the Ganges at the Ghats of Varanasi has increased more than before
 varanasi main ganga ke pani main phekal coliform bacteria count 58 fisadi tak badha paaya gaya
 After this report came, India Today went to Ground Zero to get an idea of the ground reality to know what is the situation of Ganga and Ghats in Patna
 patna shahar ke madhya se 7 kilometre doorganga nadeeki ore badhate hue is reporter ke jehan main ganga ko svachh banane ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi ke chaar saal pehle die bayaan gunj rahe the
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar also often insists on making Ganga 'nirmal' and 'aviral'

 In Patna, the sewage water coming from homes is more to blame for polluting the Ganges than industrial waste
 india today reporter sivej kepanika peechha karte hue kaali ghat tak pahunchaa
 The distance from Kali Ghat to Anta Ghat is 200 meters
 aakhirkaar reporter kaali ghat par us jagah tak bhi pahunch gaya jahaan sivej vaala bada naala ganga ke pani main mil rahaa tha
 Garbage can be seen with Anta Ghat, Anta Ghat or Kali Ghat, untreated and chemical waste can be seen everywhere

 When sewage water seeps into the Ganges through the drain, the water is filled by dipping a bottle to know how the water of the river becomes

 Even if it is unsafe to dip in water, it is not difficult for anyone to guess this
 patna main ganga ke ghaaton kii ye haalat dekhakar sawaal uthta he ki aakhir ganga kii safai ke liye jo karodon rupye kharche ja rahe hai, unka sahi nateeja kab saamne aayega?

 i hope the rest of the mlas will also implement it soon
 '' Not only this, Kejriwal has further written that "people of some areas complain that their mlas never come to meet them
 party kii sarkaar ke kaam kii chaaron taraf saraahna he lekin janata us vidhayak se bhi milanaa chaahati hai jise usne vot dekar jitayaa he
 " kejariwal kii is baat se pataa chalata he ki party ke vidhayak or janata main duuri he jiskaa khamiyaja party uthaa rahi he or vidhayak kehane ke baad main janata se nahi jud paa rahe hai
 This is the reason why Kejriwal has sought a plan from his mlas and said that the MLA should give full details of which area in the assembly constituency on which day
 yahi nahin siem kejariwal ne dilli ke mukhya sachiv ko chitthee likhakar kaha he ki maine nirdesh diya tha ki sabhi afasar apane daftar main bina appointment janata se roj milenge jabaki mujhe pataa chalaa he ki bahut se afasar iskaa paalan nahin kar rahe
 The Chief Secretary should issue a strong warning that the officer who violates these instructions will be subjected to strict disciplinary action
 tippaniyan Kejriwal has asked the Chief Secretary MM Kutty to put up a board outside the office of the bureaucrats and tell them that this officer will meet the public daily at 10-11 am without any appointment and if not received then complain on this number
 is number par aane vaali shikayaton kii jaankaree mujhe di jaae or mukhya sachiv in shikayaton par karrwai karen
 In fact, after the Delhi Municipal Corporation elections, the Aam Aadmi Party found that its mass base decreased due to increasing distance from the general public
 isliye kejariwal ne apane sabhi mantriyon, vidhayakon, afasaron ko roj subah aam janata se bina appointment milakar unki samasya kaa samaadhaan karne kaa aadesh diya
 But the legislators and officers themselves are engaged in implementing this scheme or say its wind
 yahi nahin kejariwal ne aage likhaa he ki "kuch kshetron ke logon kii shikaayat he ki unke vidhayak unase kabhi milane nahin aae
 The work of the party's government is widely appreciated, but the public also wants to meet the MLA whom he has voted to win
 " Kejriwal's point shows that there is a distance between the party's MLA and the public, which is being borne by the party and the MLA is unable to connect with the public later
 yahi kaaran he ki kejariwal ne apane vidhayakon se plan maanga he or kaha he ki vidhayak vidhansabha kshetra main kis ilaake main kis din jayega iskaa puraa byora den
 Not only this, CM Kejriwal has written a letter to the Chief Secretary of Delhi, saying that i had instructed that all officers will meet the public daily without appointment in their office, whereas i have come to know that many officers are not following it
 mukhya sachiv kadi chetavanee jari karen ki jo afasar in nirdeshon kaa ulanghan karegaa us par kadi anushaasanamak karrwai hogi
 The comments kejariwal ne mukhya sachiv mem kutti ko baqayada afasaron ke daftar ke baahar board lagaakar yah bataane ko kaha he ki yah afasar roj subah 10-11 baje bina appointment janata se milegaa or nahin milane par is number par shikaayat karen
 i should be informed about the complaints coming on this number and the Chief Secretary should take action on these complaints
 darasal aam aadmi party ne dilli nagar nigam chunaav ke baad yah paaya ki aam janata se uski duuri badhane ke chalate uskaa janaadhar ghat gaya
 Therefore, Kejriwal ordered all his ministers, mlas, officers to meet the general public every morning without any appointment and solve their problem
 lekin is yojana ko lagu karne yaa yun kahen isaki hawa nikaalane main khud vidhayak or afasar lage hue hai

 Captain Virat Kohli is going to be the focal point of Team India's batting in the current Test series between India and England
 
 
 vishakhapatanam ke pehle din ke khel ke baad to yahi lag rahaa he
 On the first day of the match, Virat played a memorable innings and after falling the first two wickets, together with Pujara laid the foundation for the honorable score
 shatak banane ke baad pujaara to out ho gaye lekin kohli english gendbaajon ke liye abhi bhi saradard bane hue hai
 In his innings of 151 runs, he faced 241 balls and hit 15 fours
 kohli ke kariyar kaa yah 14waan shatak he
 Seeing the way Kohli is 'improving' his game, it can be said that the sky is his limit
 pehle test kii duusari pari main team india ke liye haar taalane main viraat ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 If Kohli, who holds a batting average above 50 in odis and T20s, will be in 50+ clubs in Test cricket soon
 duusare test main team india ke pehle do wicket paanch over ke andar hi girane kaa parinaam yah hua ki viraat ko chathe over se hi ballebaaji ke liye utarana padaa
 In a way, this situation was like an opener
 unhen urja se bhare tej gendbaajon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The comments england main hui siries main james anderson jis tarah se kohli ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab bane the, uske maddenjar har kisi kii najar in donon diggaj cricketron ke mukaable par tiki thi
 Talking about the first day, it can be said that Virat was ahead in this match on Thursday
 bhartiya captain ne bina kisi dabaav ke anderson kaa saamana kiya or unke khilaaf aakraamak shot lagane se bhi nahin chuke
 By the way, after lunch, Virat got a life when Adil Rashid, standing at long leg off Ben Stocks, could not catch his catch
 bhartiya captain us samay 56 ran par the
 Talking about England, the good news for him on the first day was James Anderson's bowling and Ajinkya Rahane's wicket in the last session
 match ke duusare din cricket premiyon kii najar is baat par hogi ki viraat apni 151 ran kii naabad pari ko badhaakar kahaan tak pahunchaate hai or team india kii pehali pari kis score par khatm hoti he
 If Team India managed to get past its 450, then the pressure would definitely be on Captain Cook and his team

 The way James Anderson became a problem for Kohli in the series in England, everyone's eyes were on the match between these two cricketers
 pehle din kii baat karen to kaha ja saktaa he ki guuruuvaar ko viraat is mukaable main aage rahe
 The Indian captain faced Anderson without any pressure and did not miss out on aggressive shots against him
 vaise, lunch ke baad viraat ko us samay jeevandaan mila jab ben stokes kii gend par long leg par khadey adil raashid unka kaich nahin pakad paae
 The Indian captain was 56 at that time
 england ke lihaaj se baat karen to uske liye pehle din kii acchhee khabar james anderson kii gendbaaji or aakhri seshan main ajinkya rahane kaa wicket girnaa rahaa
 On the second day of the match, cricket fans will keep an eye on how Virat extends his 151-run unbeaten innings and at what score Team India's first innings ends
 agar team india apana score 450 ke paar pahunchane main kaamyaab rahi to nishchit rup se dabaav captain cook or unki team par hoga

 Not today but in August 2017, their results had arrived, but for ten months these students were sitting home feeling restless
 bahuton kii maansik or aarthik sthiti karaab hone lagi thi
 Nobody was answering them, but our job series have had an impact on the system and at the moment when the wind of Delhi is turning into storms, 505 youth will be hugging with their parents, calling relatives

 However, the list of 505 students who have come is not happy and the rest are also expected

 You are happy to tell the audience that the zone of 505 CBDT youth has been allotted

 In this episode, 3287 youths are waiting for appointment letters, but today the train of 505 youths has moved ahead
 sibiditi setral board aap diarect taxes ne apni website par 505 incum tex inspectoron kii suchi daal di he
 Once the zone is allotted, the process of getting the appointment letter is only a matter of a few days
 sibiditi kii website par list aane se pehle yahi noujvaan dukhi tha
 His faith was shaking because people in the villages started asking if he had lied that the job was done
 prime time kii naukari series kii kamyaabi aap darshakon kii vajah se hui he
 If you had not left the topic of Hindu Muslim and did not support the topic considered monotonous among the media editors, the government would not have sensed it
 abhi bhi dekhie soochna prasaaran mantralay ne sau se adhik naujavaanon ko niyukti patr nahin diya he
 How long have i been taking his agony

 The CBDT has removed the list of zones for 505 income tax inspectors

 a student has written me a letter
 aapako bataa den, farvari main jab hamaari naukari series ufaan par thi tab uske dabaav main 3287 naujavaanon se zone kaa vikalp poocha gaya
 The youth filled the form but the car stopped

 jis bharti ko piyush goyal apane twit main tsunami bataa rahe the, wo tsunami kidar he
 In the February 16 tweet, Piyush Goyal writes that @piyushgoyal Tsunami! 90,000 jobs in Indian Railways

 railway main karier banaaen or nae bharat main apana yogadan karen
 Finance Minister Piyush Goyal could neither get appointment letters in the hands of 3287 Income Tax Assistants nor could announce the date of the examination which was said to be the world's largest recruitment drive
 31 march farm bharne kii antim taarikh thi, 31 may tak imtahaan kaa pataa nahin
 The date has not been announced even after two months
 10 farvari ko rail mantralay ne 90,000 se adhik vaikency bharne kaa elaan kiya tha
 The last date to fill its form was 31 March
 us vakt kaha gaya tha ki pariksha april may main ho sakati he magar jab taarikh kaa pataa nahin chalaa tab farm bharne vaale baichaiyn hone lage
 Meanwhile, the Railway Recruitment Bort has issued a notice on 31 May

 Examination of application form is going on and preparation of computer based examination is also going on
 in kaaryon ke puraa ho jane par website par pariksha kii taarikh kaa elaan ho jayega
 It is true that there are 2 crore 37 lakh forms, but will the online system not have the ability to scrub these forms? phir online kaa matlab kya hua
 Does the Railways not know by when this work will be completed, is it not good that the exam date would have been announced and the students would have been relaxed and prepared
 railway kii sansadeey samiti kii report thi ki 2 lakh se adhik pad khaali hai magar bhartee nikali ek lakh se kuch kam
 No one knows when the examination will be completed and when the results will come and when the appointment letter will be received
 aam taur par railway kii pariksha kaa ausat nikaalenge to vigyaapan nikaalane se lekar antim riselt aane main do se teen saal kaa samay lag jaataa he
 Who will win in 2019 is more important than when the youth will get the appointment letter
 banker udhaas hai, ki itane sangharsh ke baad unki selary or anya maangon par kisi ne dhyaan nahin diya
 The strike of the Gramin Dak Sevaks of India has been going on for 18 days

 Necessary documents of people have been stuck, yet no result of these strike has come
 yogi sarkaar ne 12460 shikshakon ko niyukti patr dene kaa vaada kiya tha, kaha tha ki march main hi niyukti patr mil jayega, magar in shikshakon kaa kahana he ki sirf 4000 shikshakon ko hi niyukti patr mila he, baaki 8000 phir se sangharsh par aa gaye hai
 Why our governments do not say clearly in terms of jobs
 agle das dinon tak desh ke kai gaanv band rahenge
 The Kisan Ekta Manch has announced a farmer curfew from June 1 to June 10
 is sanghathan main 65 kisaan sanghathan shaamil hai
 During this time, the farmers will not supply milk and vegetables to the cities
 ve sirf gaanvon ko hi bechenge
 The comments maharashtra kii sadakon par tanker se doodh giraate is video ko dekhakar kalejaa kaanp jaataa he
 Our colleague Sunil Singh has told that thousands of milk producers entered the tehsil's door in Ahmednagar
 unki maang he ki dugh kii nunatam keemat 27 rupee prati litre ho
 Farmers have become very upset due to falling milk prices
 punjab ke dugdh utpaadakon kii bhi vahi haalat he
 They are also expressing their anger by throwing milk
 quint kii ek report he ki maharashtra main ek gaay ke peeche rose kaa kharchaa 300 rupaya he magar aamadani 200 rupee bhi nahin ho paati he
 In June last year, the government accepted the demand of farmers and raised the price of cow's milk from 24 to 27 rupees per liter, but even after the government announcement, cooperatives are not giving these prices
 sarkaar bhi karrwai nahin kar rahi he
 Farmers of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh are very excited about the price of milk
 maharashtra main har din 2 karod 30 lakh litre doodh har din jamaa kiya jaataa he
 Milk producers say that the government fixes the rate at Rs 27 per liter, but the cooperative and dairy farmers pay Rs 17 per liter, which is very low
 ek tarika or ho saktaa tha ki doodh phenkane kii jagah garib bacchon ko hi pilaa dete
 Last year, the peasant movement started from Tamba village, where the farmers performed a collective shraadh on the promise of the government
 kai jagahon par sabziyaan phenk di gayi
 Farmers want one and a half times the cost
 kisaan sirf daam nahin maang rahe balki pension bhi maang rahe hai
 Police activism was seen in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh
 madhyapradesh main 18 zilon main eseef kii 18 companiyaan, 5000 atirikt jawan tainaat kiye gaye hai
 Mandsaur firing convicts are also to be punished in these areas
 madhyapradesh main kisaan yah bhi chaahate hai ki sookhaa prabhavit kshetron main raahat saamagree turant banti jaae
 The price of sugarcane should be given at Rs 400 per quintal, diesel subsidy should be given to the farmers
 krishi upkaran ko jiesti se mukt kiya jaae
 It is a big issue that it is becoming difficult for farmers to buy equipment for them
 ek maang dilachasp he or bahut jaruri he
 Every farmer in India should be adamant about this demand
 ki gaanvon main ucchstareey shiksha or swasthya kendron kii suvidha di jaae
 But the governments will give them the excuse of insurance that we will give health insurance, but the farmer is asking for a quality hospital in the village
 upi main ganna kisaanon ke bakaaye ke mudde kaa nateeja aapane dekha hi lekin agra kii taraf jaaiye to aalu kisaan daam ko lekar tut chuke hai
 Their problems could not be overcome
 prime time main hi aapane dekha tha ki bihar ke dalhan kisaanon ko daam nahin mil rahaa he
 The farmers are upset
 aakhir kab tak kisaan baar-baar andolan ke tewaron ke saath lautate rahenge
 When will the problem be resolved? magar ham sabake liye khush hona chaahate hai, ummid he baaki ke 2,782 naujavaanon ko bhi niyukti patr or zone kaa aavanton agle hafte tak mil jayega jab ham somvaar ko phir se naukari series main is maamle kii samiksha karenge

 31 March was the last date to fill the form, till 31 May examination was not done
 do maheene baad bhi taarikh kaa elaan nahin hua he
 On 10 February, the Ministry of Railways announced to fill more than 90,000 vacancies
 iske farm bharne kii antim taarikh 31 march thi
 It was said at that time that the exam might be held in april-may, but when the date was not known, then the form-makers started getting restless
 isi bich railway recruitment bort ne 31 may ko ek notice jari kiya he
 It said that this time 2 crore 37 lakh forms have been filled unexpectedly
 aavedan farm kii jaanch chal rahi he or computer aadhaarit pariksha kii taiyaari bhi chal rahi he
 On completion of these tasks, the examination date will be announced on the website
 yah baat sahi he ki 2 karod 37 lakh farm bahut hai magar kya online system main inte farm kii scrootni karne kii kshamta nahin hogi
 Then what did online mean
 kya railway ko pataa nahin ki yah kaam kab tak puraa ho jayega, kya yah acha nahin hota ki pariksha kii taarikh kaa elaan ho jaataa or chaatr nishcint hokar taiyaari karte
 There was a report of the Parliamentary Committee on Railways that more than 2 lakh posts have been vacated but recruitment has been less than one lakh
 uski bhi pariksha kab puri hogi or kab nattejey aaenge or kab niyukti patr milegaa koi nahin jaanata
 Generally, if you take the average of railway examination, then it takes two to three years from the advertisement to the final result
 2019 main koun jitegaa usase zyaada zaruri he ki naujavaanon ko niyukti patr kab milegaa
 Bankers are sad that after so much struggle, their salary and other demands were not paid attention
 bharat ke gramin dak sevakon kii hadtaal 18 din se jari he
 Delivery of letter sheets to post offices has been stopped
 logon ke zaruri kaagazat funs gaye hai phir bhi in hadtaal kaa koi nateeja nahin niklaa he
 The Yogi government promised to give appointment letters to 12460 teachers, said that the appointment letter will be received only in March, but these teachers say that only 4000 teachers have received the appointment letter, the remaining 8000 have come back to the struggle again Huh
 hamaari sarkarein naukari dene ke maamle main saaf saaf kyon nahin kahati hai
 For the next ten days, many villages in the country will remain closed
 kisaan ekta manch ne ek june se 10 june ke liye kisaan karfu kaa elaan kiya he
 This organization consists of 65 farmer organizations
 is dauraan kisaan shaharon ko dugh or sabziyon kii supplai nahin karenge
 They will sell only to villages
 tippaniyan The heart is shaken by watching this video of milk pouring from a tanker on the streets of Maharashtra
 hamaare sahyogi sunil singh ne bataaya he ki ahmednagar main hajaaron dugdh utpaadak tehsil kaa daravaaza kholkar andar ghus gaye
 Their demand is that the minimum price of milk should be Rs 27 per liter
 doodh ke daam girane se kisaan kaaphi pareshaan ho gaye hai
 The milk producers of Punjab also have the same condition
 ve bhi doodh phenk kar apana rosh jataa rahe hai
 There is a report by Quint that in Maharashtra, the daily expenditure on the back of a cow is 300 rupees but the income is not even 200 rupees
 pichley saal june main sarkaar ne kisaanon kii maang maan lee thi or gaay ke doodh kaa daam 24 se badhaakar 27 rupee prati litre kar diya tha lekin sarkari ghoshnaa ke baad bhi koparative ye bhav nahin de rahe hai
 The government is also not taking action
 doodh ke daam ko lekar madhyapradesh or uttar pradesh ke kisaan kaaphi uttejit hai
 In Maharashtra, 2 crore 30 lakh liters of milk is stored every day
 dugdh utpaadakon kaa kahana he ki sarkaar rate tay karti he 27 rupee prati litre magar koparative or dairy vaale 17 rupee prati litre dete hai jo ki bahut kam hai
 Another way would have been to feed poor children instead of throwing milk
 pichley saal kisaan andolan kii shuruuaat tamba gaanv se hui thi vahaan par kisaanon ne sarkaar kii vaadakhilaphi ko lekar samuhik shraadh kiya
 Vegetables were spilled in many places
 kisaan laagat kaa dedh guna daam chaahate hai
 The farmers are not only asking for the price but also the pension
 rajasthan or madhyapradesh main police kii sakriyata dekhi gai
 In SAF, 18 companies of SAF, 5000 additional personnel have been deployed in 18 districts
 in ilaakon main mandsaur golicond ke doshiyon ko sazaa dilvaanaa bhi he
 Farmers in Madhya Pradesh also want relief materials to be distributed immediately in drought-affected areas
 ganne kaa mulya 400 rupee prati quintal diya jaae, kisaanon ko dijal sabsidi di jaae
 Agricultural equipment should be exempted from GST
 yah bahut bada masalaa he kisaanon ke liye unke liye upkaran khareednaa mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 a demand is interesting and very urgent
 bharat ke har kisaan ko is maang ko lekar ad janaa chahie
 That high-level education and health centers be provided in villages
 magar sarkarein unhen beemaa kaa jhansa de dengi ki ham swasthya beemaa denge, lekin kisaan gaanv main quality kaa aspataal maang rahaa he
 You have seen the result of the issue of sugarcane farmers' dues in UP, but if you go to Agra, potato farmers are broke about the price
 unki pareshaani dur nahin ho saki he
 In prime time itself you saw that pulses farmers of Bihar are not getting the price
 kisaan pareshaan hai
 After all, how long will the farmers keep returning with the agitation of the movement again and again
 inaki samasya kaa samaadhaan kab hoga

 america ne iran ko chetavanee di he ki vah faras kii khadi main tel vaahak poton ke aane jane kaa rasta band karne kaa dussah na dikhaae

 a post shared bysalman Khan (@beingsalmankhan) onmar 4, 2018 at 7:00 am PST gudgaanv main ek sharaab vyavsaayee manish gurjar urf pappu kii goli markar hatya kar di gai
 Manish was shot more than 20 shots
 police ko ashanka he ki gangvaar ke chalate hi manish kii hatya kii gai he
 However, police is also investigating it as a case of looting
 ghatana ke samay manish railway road sthit prem mandir ke paas apane sharaab ke theke par cash collection ke liye driver or apane ek dost liyakat ke saath pahunchaa tha
 At the same time, two people riding a bike fired Manish
 goliyaan manish ke driver or liyakat ko bhi lagi
 The three were taken to Medanta in critical condition, where doctors declared Manish dead
 manish ke driver or liyakat kii haalat gambhir bani hui he
 Explain that the deceased liquor baron Manish was the elder brother of gangster Binder Gurjar
 jail me band binder ke upar gangster sandip gachauli kaa police ke saath milakar kathith encounter karwaane kaa aarope he
 The Mumbai Police is investigating this matter
 gauratlab he ki beete 21 sitambar ko binder ke karibigangustermahesh atake ko bhi isi tarah goliyon se bhun diya gaya tha
 In this case, a shooter of Kaushal Gang was arrested by the police
 somvaar raat hui sharaab vyavsaayee manish kii hatya ko bhi isi gangvaar se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 Police is currently investigating the case
 prashasan or sarkaron ko ab soshal media se ghabrahat hone lagi he
 Internet service has been shut again in many districts in Kashmir and Gujarat
 kashmir ke kupwada, baraamula, bandipura or ganderbal main net sevaayen band karne kii khabar he
 Like in the month of August last year in Gujarat, this time Internet service has been stopped due to Patel movement
 ahmedabad, rajkot, vadodara, sabarkantha main internet seva band he
 Then people were also complaining that the police had beaten them up a lot, we could not share their videos, so the internet service was stopped
 internet seva band karnaa dhad se dhara 144 laga dene jaisaa ho gaya he
 Now even to prevent theft in examinations, internet service is stopped in the city during that time
 farvari maheene main gujarat main hi rajasav lekhpal kii pariksha ke dauraan subah nau baje se ek baje tak ke liye internet seva band kar di gai, taaki nakal na ho sake
 These decisions are suggesting that the Internet is no longer free sky
 The Wire naam kii news site ne likhaa he ki kashmir main pichley chaar saal main 18 se 25 dinon ke liye internet seva band kii gai
 Last year, according to a Huffington Post report, Internet services were shut down nine times in four states in India between 2013 and 2015
 gujarat, kashmir ke alaava nagaland or manipur main internet band hua he
 In 2011, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) made an estimate that Egypt had lost $ 900 million by shutting down the Internet for five days
 varsh 2015 main germany kii ek sanstha ne pakistan main internet band kiye jane ko lekar ek adhyayan kar bataaya tha ki kaise isse na sirf abhivyakti kii swatantraaa par hamalaa hota he, balki rashtriya yaa vyaktigat suraksha yaa bijness ko bhi nuksaan pahunch saktaa he
 In India too, from the Times of India to the Indian Express wrote that during the first phase of the Patel agitation in Gujarat, there was a loss of between 30 crores to 7,000 crores
 ham sabakaa jivan ab internet se judaa hua he
 The government also does many of its work through the app
 i-commers, hotel, paryaton se lekar tamaam tarah ke bijness internet ke jariye hi hote hai
 Common people also now live through the net available on smartphones
 media main report kam hi hota he ki internet band hone se logon ko kis tarah se pareshaani hui
 The Internet is now like air and water
 kya prashasan hinsak sthiti main pani kii supplai band kar detaa he
 
 
 The If this is the case then the government should tell that when the internet will be closed for some reason, then you can go to the app and take its facilities
 prashasan ko dar rahata he ki soshal media ke jariye afvaahen failane se sthiti niyantran se baahar ho sakati he
 At times, she will also close her stories to prevent the spread of her failure
 soshal media par rose afvaahen failati rahati hai, to kya rose hi fasebuk or whotsap band kar diya jaae
 Social media emerged as a space where people were
 jo media or raajnneetik dalon se alag ek nae spes kii rachana kar rahe the or apni baaten likh rahe the
 Now there is no need to tell how the parties used this space to politicize and how the process of spreading rumors continues even today
 is khel main sattadhari dal se jude samarthakon or sanghathanon kaa hi palada baari rahata he
 There is rarely action against them
 sangathit rup se gaali di ja rahi he, dhamkee di ja rahi he or manamafik na likhane par raajnneetik samarthak whotsap se lekar fasebuk or twitor par badnaam karne kaa khel khilne lagate hai
 a large number of people have been put on social media to control debates and issues
 inke hangaamaa karne se news channelon ke news room main bhuuchaal-sa aa jaataa he
 Anchors consider them as the public and start speaking their language, and when they become silent, the issue disappears from the channels
 jaise gujarat main zamaanat par reeha hue adhikari ko police pramukh bana diya
 These supporters have not abused the media as to why you are silent, while the person who has been removed is openly saying that he did not ask for his removal from office
 unhen police pramukh ke pad se nahin hataaya jaae
 DG Vanzara comes out of jail, and publicly dances with a sword
 vah khud ko deshbhakt bataate hue duusare deshbhakton kaa shukriya adaa karte hai
 If the same incident had happened in another state, these people would have abused the media that the media has been sold
 falaanaa patrkaar chor he, dalal he
 Fellow organizations and supporters of the ruling party are allowed to spread rumors and abuses
 logon main inaki baton se tanaav bhi failaa, magar ab ve bhi samajhane lage ki kis baat par bharosa karnaa he kis par nahin
 People are beginning to know how political media is being used
 agar log nahin chete to unke haath se yah madhyam chhin jayega
 Recently, few people agitated about Amrapali Housing Society
 unhone soshal media kaa acha istemaal kar mahendra singh dhoni se lekar amrapali group tak par thik-thaak dabaav paidaa kar diya, jisaki vajah se media main bhi khabaren chalin, lekin khaas vichaardhaara ko lekar patrakaron ko gaali dene vaale samarthakon ke jansamooh ne in nagarikon kaa saath diya
 You readers should check on their timeline
 aamtaur par log afvahabaazon kii baton ko nazarandaaz kar dete hai yaa block kar dete hai, lekin jab prashasan aisa karne lage to is par saarvajanik bahes honi chahie
 Did not violent protests on reservation take place in the pre-internet era
 
 
 ? hinsa internet ke kaaran hi bhadakti he, kya yah har maamle main hota he
 Police work is also to ensure performance, so that the voices in democracy continue to be raised
 yah bhi ek tathy he ki patel andolan ke dauraan hinsa ho rahi he
 The agitators will also have to think that unless they ensure a non-violent movement, the police will get a chance to do so easily
 iske liye patel netaa bhi kam zimmedaar nahin hai
 Rumors arose in Kashmir that a girl was allegedly teased by army men
 vah ladki baar-baar kah rahi he ki sena ke logon ne aisa nahin kiya he
 Had he been introduced to journalists, his videos would have been spread through the internet, would the administration not have been able to compete better with the crowd on the basis of correct information
 vahaan ladki kii maa kaa press conference roak diya gaya, internet seva band kar di gai
 The administration should think how to use it properly before shutting down the Internet
 koi tarika nikaalnaa chahie ki sabhi internet upabhoktaaon ko samuhik rup se soochna bheji ja sake
 Such rumors are spread many times even by mainstream media
 prashasan ne kai jagahon par channelon ko bhi band kiya he
 The comments isi khel ko aam nagarikon ko samajhnaa he or satark rahanaa he
 Those who speak the language of political supporters only have loyalty to their party
 desh ke prati hoti to ve sookhe ko lekar hangaamaa kar rahe hote
 But these people are starting to spread the rumor that for the first time in India, there is a water rail
 kendriya mantri uma bharti bhi yah baat hamaare sahyogi shrinivas jain ke intervyuu main kah rahi hai
 The matter reached them either from the government or through social media
 
 
 ? indian express ne ravivaar ko chapa he ki 2 may, 1986 ko bharat main pehali baar gujarat ke rajkot main pani kii rail chali thi
 i was informed by someone that in the '50s there used to be a water rail between Allahabad to Manikpur in Bundelkhand
 main is soochna kii pushti nahin kar sakaa hum, lekin sarkaar ke log itani aasaani se kaise bol de rahe hai ki pehali baar pani kii rail chali he
 Do they check their facts properly
 behatar he ki ham samaaj se hi baat karen
 The administration should convey the correct facts and it is necessary that the internet service is not stopped
 kuch saal pehle landan main dange bhadak uthe
 Police found that some things have been spread through social media
 internet seva band karne kii jagah police ne apni baat logon tak pahunchaani shuru kar di
 The result was that the violence stopped
 ise lekar baqayada report banaai gai thi ki kya internet ke kaaran dange bhadakte hai
 What is needed is to highlight the political side of this rumor culture and compete with the right facts
 internet band karnaa antim upaay hona chahie, pehla kadam nahin
 a news site called The Wire wrote that in Kashmir, Internet services were shut down for 18 to 25 days in the last four years
 pichley saal hafington post kii ek report ke anusaar bharat main 2013 se 2015 ke bich chaar rajyon main nau baar internet sevaayen band kii gayi
 Apart from Gujarat, Kashmir, internet has stopped in Nagaland and Manipur
 varsh 2011 main Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) ne ek anumaan lagaaya tha ki misr main paanch din ke liye internet band kar dene se nau karod dollar kaa nuksaan ho gaya tha
 In 2015, a German organization did a study about the internet shutdown in Pakistan, how it not only attacks freedom of expression, but can also harm national or personal security or business
 bharat main bhi times of india se lekar indian express tak ne likhaa ki gujarat main patel andolan ke pehle charan ke dauraan internet band karne se 30 karod se lekar 7,000 karod tak kaa nuksaan hua
 All of our lives are now connected to the Internet
 sarkaar bhi apane kai kaam ap ke jariye karti he
 From e-commerce, hotels, tourism, all types of businesses are done through the Internet
 aam log bhi ab smartphone par uplabdh net ke jariye jite hai
 There are few reports in the media about how people were troubled by the shutdown of the Internet
 internet ab hawa-pani kii tarah he
 Does the administration stop water supply in a violent situation
 
 
 ? agar aisa he to sarkaar ko bataanaa chahie ki jab kisi kaaran se internet band hoga, tab aap ap ke alaava kahaan jaakar uski suvidhaayen le sakate hai
 The administration fears that the rumors may spread out of control through social media
 kai baar vah apni naakaami ke kisse failane se rokane ke liye bhi band karti hogi
 If rumors continue to spread on social media daily, should Facebook and whatsapp be discontinued every day
 soshal media kaa ubhaar ek aise spes ke rup main hua tha, jahaan log the
 Who were creating a new space and writing their own talks apart from the media and political parties
 ab bataane ki zarurat nahin he ki kis tarah se dalon ne is spes kaa istemaal raajnneetikaran karne main kiya or kis tarah se afvaahen failaane kaa silsilaa aaj bhi jari he
 In this game, the backbone of the supporters and organizations associated with the ruling party is heavy
 inke khilaaf shaayad hi kabhi karrwai hoti he
 Organized abuses, threats are being made and political supporters start playing a game of defamation from whatsapp to Facebook and Twitter for not writing the way they want
 bahut badi sankhya main logon ko soshal media par lagaaya gaya he, taaki ve bahason or muddon ko niyantrit kar saken
 Due to their ruckus, there is a bit of panic in the news rooms of the news channels
 ankar inhen janata samajhakar inaki bhashaa bolne lagate hai, or jab ye chup ho jate hai, to vah mudda channelon se gaayab ho jaataa he
 For example, the officer released on bail in Gujarat was made the Chief of Police
 ise lekar in samarthakon ne media ko gaali nahin di ki aap chup kyon hai, jabaki jis vyakti ko hataaya gaya he, vah khuleam kah rahaa he ki unhone pad se hataane kii guzarish nahin kii thi
 He should not be removed from the post of Chief of Police
 diji vanjaaraa jail se chhootakar aate hai, or saarvajanik rup se talwaar lekar dance karte hai
 He calls himself a patriot and thanks other patriots
 yahi ghatana agar kisi duusare rajya main hui hoti, to ye log galigalouj kaa ambara laga dete ki media bik gaya he
 The journalist is a thief, a broker
 sattadhari dal ke saathi sanghathanon or samarthakon ko afvaah failaane or galigalouj karne kii chhot he
 His words also caused tension among the people, but now they also started to understand what to trust and not
 log jaanane lage hai ki soshal media kaa kis tarah se rajnatik istemaal ho rahaa he
 If people do not warn, then this medium will be snatched from their hands
 abhi haal hi main amrapali houseing sosayadi ko lekar chand logon ne andolan kiya
 He made good use of social media and created a lot of pressure from Mahendra Singh Dhoni to the Amrapali group, due to which the news also came in the media, but the crowd of supporters who abused the journalists about the particular ideology of these citizens stood by
 aap pathakon ko inaki timeline par jaakar check karnaa chahie
 People usually ignore or block rumors of rumors, but when the administration starts doing this, it should be debated in public
 kya aarakshan ko lekar hinsak pradarshan internet se pehle ke daur main nahin hue
 
 
 The Violence is caused by the Internet, does it happen in every case
 police kaa kaam pradarshan sunishchit karana bhi he, taaki loktantr main awaz uthati rahe
 It is also a fact that violence is taking place during the Patel agitation
 andolan karne waalon ko bhi sochna hoga ki jab tak ve ahimsak andolan sunishchit nahin karenge, police ko aisa karne kaa mauka aasaani se miltaa rahegaa
 Patel leaders are also no less responsible for this
 kashmir main afvaah hi udi ki ek ladki ko kathith rup se sena ke logon ne chhedaa he
 The girl is repeatedly saying that the army men have not done so
 agar use patrakaron se milaayaa jaataa, uske video ko internet ke jariye failaayaa jaataa to kya sahi soochna ke aadhaar par prashasan bheed se behatar muqabla nahin kar paati
 There the press conference of the girl's mother was stopped, internet service was stopped
 prashasan ko sochna chahie ki internet band karne se pehle uskaa sahi istemaal kaise kiya ja saktaa he
 There is a way that information can be sent collectively to all internet users
 is tarah kii afvaahen to kai baar mukhyadhara kii media se bhi fail jaati hai
 The administration has also closed channels in many places
 tippaniyan This game has to be understood by ordinary citizens and to be alert
 raajnneetik samarthakon kii bhashaa bolne waalon kii nishtha sirf apane dal ke prati hoti he
 Had he been towards the country, he would have been making a ruckus about the drought
 lekin ye log yah afvaah failaane main lage hai ki bharat main pehali baar pani kii rail chali he
 Union Minister Uma Bharti is also saying this in the interview of our colleague Srinivas Jain
 un tak yah baat sarkaar se pahunchi yaa soshal media ke jariye
 
 
 The The Indian Express has published on Sunday that for the first time in India, a water train ran in Rajkot, Gujarat on May 2, 1986
 mujhe kisi ne soochna di thi ki '50 ke dashak main elahabaad se bundelkhand ke manikpur ke bich pani kii rail chalati thi
 i have not been able to confirm this information, but how are the people of the government speaking so easily that for the first time the water train has run
 kya ve apane tathyon kii sahi se jaanch karte hai
 It is better that we talk to the society
 prashasan sahi tathyon ko us tak pahunchaae or iske liye zaruri he ki internet seva band na ho
 Riots erupted in London a few years ago
 police ne paaya ki soshal media ke jariye kuch baaten failaai gai hai
 Instead of shutting down internet service, the police started spreading its message to the people
 nateeja yah hua ki hinsa tham gai
 a report was made about whether the Internet sparked riots
 zarurat he ki ham is afvaah samskruti ke raajnneetik paksh ko ujagar karen or sahi tathyon se muqabla karen
 Turning off the Internet should be the last resort, not the first step
 ham sabakaa jivan ab internet se judaa hua he
 The government also does many of its work through the app
 i-commers, hotel, paryaton se lekar tamaam tarah ke bijness internet ke jariye hi hote hai
 Common people also now live through the net available on smartphones
 media main report kam hi hota he ki internet band hone se logon ko kis tarah se pareshaani hui
 The Internet is now like air and water
 kya prashasan hinsak sthiti main pani kii supplai band kar detaa he
 
 
 The If this is the case then the government should tell that when the internet will be closed for some reason, then you can go to the app and take its facilities
 prashasan ko dar rahata he ki soshal media ke jariye afvaahen failane se sthiti niyantran se baahar ho sakati he
 At times, she will also close her stories to prevent the spread of her failure
 soshal media par rose afvaahen failati rahati hai, to kya rose hi fasebuk or whotsap band kar diya jaae
 Social media emerged as a space where people were
 jo media or raajnneetik dalon se alag ek nae spes kii rachana kar rahe the or apni baaten likh rahe the
 Now there is no need to tell how the parties used this space to politicize and how the process of spreading rumors continues even today
 is khel main sattadhari dal se jude samarthakon or sanghathanon kaa hi palada baari rahata he
 There is rarely action against them
 sangathit rup se gaali di ja rahi he, dhamkee di ja rahi he or manamafik na likhane par raajnneetik samarthak whotsap se lekar fasebuk or twitor par badnaam karne kaa khel khilne lagate hai
 a large number of people have been put on social media to control debates and issues
 inke hangaamaa karne se news channelon ke news room main bhuuchaal-sa aa jaataa he
 Anchors consider them as the public and start speaking their language, and when they become silent, the issue disappears from the channels
 jaise gujarat main zamaanat par reeha hue adhikari ko police pramukh bana diya
 These supporters have not abused the media as to why you are silent, while the person who has been removed is openly saying that he did not ask for his removal from office
 unhen police pramukh ke pad se nahin hataaya jaae
 DG Vanzara comes out of jail, and publicly dances with a sword
 vah khud ko deshbhakt bataate hue duusare deshbhakton kaa shukriya adaa karte hai
 If the same incident had happened in another state, these people would have abused the media that the media has been sold
 falaanaa patrkaar chor he, dalal he
 Fellow organizations and supporters of the ruling party are allowed to spread rumors and abuses
 logon main inaki baton se tanaav bhi failaa, magar ab ve bhi samajhane lage ki kis baat par bharosa karnaa he kis par nahin
 People are beginning to know how political media is being used
 agar log nahin chete to unke haath se yah madhyam chhin jayega
 Recently, few people agitated about Amrapali Housing Society
 unhone soshal media kaa acha istemaal kar mahendra singh dhoni se lekar amrapali group tak par thik-thaak dabaav paidaa kar diya, jisaki vajah se media main bhi khabaren chalin, lekin khaas vichaardhaara ko lekar patrakaron ko gaali dene vaale samarthakon ke jansamooh ne in nagarikon kaa saath diya
 You readers should check on their timeline
 aamtaur par log afvahabaazon kii baton ko nazarandaaz kar dete hai yaa block kar dete hai, lekin jab prashasan aisa karne lage to is par saarvajanik bahes honi chahie
 Did not violent protests on reservation take place in the pre-internet era
 
 
 ? hinsa internet ke kaaran hi bhadakti he, kya yah har maamle main hota he
 Police work is also to ensure performance, so that the voices in democracy continue to be raised
 yah bhi ek tathy he ki patel andolan ke dauraan hinsa ho rahi he
 The agitators will also have to think that unless they ensure a non-violent movement, the police will get a chance to do so easily
 iske liye patel netaa bhi kam zimmedaar nahin hai
 Rumors arose in Kashmir that a girl was allegedly teased by army men
 vah ladki baar-baar kah rahi he ki sena ke logon ne aisa nahin kiya he
 Had he been introduced to journalists, his videos would have been spread through the internet, would the administration not have been able to compete better with the crowd on the basis of correct information
 vahaan ladki kii maa kaa press conference roak diya gaya, internet seva band kar di gai
 The administration should think how to use it properly before shutting down the Internet
 koi tarika nikaalnaa chahie ki sabhi internet upabhoktaaon ko samuhik rup se soochna bheji ja sake
 Such rumors are spread many times even by mainstream media
 prashasan ne kai jagahon par channelon ko bhi band kiya he
 The comments isi khel ko aam nagarikon ko samajhnaa he or satark rahanaa he
 Those who speak the language of political supporters only have loyalty to their party
 desh ke prati hoti to ve sookhe ko lekar hangaamaa kar rahe hote
 But these people are starting to spread the rumor that for the first time in India, there is a water rail
 kendriya mantri uma bharti bhi yah baat hamaare sahyogi shrinivas jain ke intervyuu main kah rahi hai
 The matter reached them either from the government or through social media
 
 
 ? indian express ne ravivaar ko chapa he ki 2 may, 1986 ko bharat main pehali baar gujarat ke rajkot main pani kii rail chali thi
 i was informed by someone that in the '50s there used to be a water rail between Allahabad to Manikpur in Bundelkhand
 main is soochna kii pushti nahin kar sakaa hum, lekin sarkaar ke log itani aasaani se kaise bol de rahe hai ki pehali baar pani kii rail chali he
 Do they check their facts properly
 behatar he ki ham samaaj se hi baat karen
 The administration should convey the correct facts and it is necessary that the internet service is not stopped
 kuch saal pehle landan main dange bhadak uthe
 Police found that some things have been spread through social media
 internet seva band karne kii jagah police ne apni baat logon tak pahunchaani shuru kar di
 The result was that the violence stopped
 ise lekar baqayada report banaai gai thi ki kya internet ke kaaran dange bhadakte hai
 What is needed is to highlight the political side of this rumor culture and compete with the right facts
 internet band karnaa antim upaay hona chahie, pehla kadam nahin
 The administration fears that the rumors may spread out of control through social media
 kai baar vah apni naakaami ke kisse failane se rokane ke liye bhi band karti hogi
 If rumors continue to spread on social media daily, should Facebook and whatsapp be discontinued every day
 soshal media kaa ubhaar ek aise spes ke rup main hua tha, jahaan log the
 Who were creating a new space and writing their own talks apart from the media and political parties
 ab bataane ki zarurat nahin he ki kis tarah se dalon ne is spes kaa istemaal raajnneetikaran karne main kiya or kis tarah se afvaahen failaane kaa silsilaa aaj bhi jari he
 In this game, the backbone of the supporters and organizations associated with the ruling party is heavy
 inke khilaaf shaayad hi kabhi karrwai hoti he
 Organized abuses, threats are being made and political supporters start playing a game of defamation from whatsapp to Facebook and Twitter for not writing the way they want
 bahut badi sankhya main logon ko soshal media par lagaaya gaya he, taaki ve bahason or muddon ko niyantrit kar saken
 Due to their ruckus, there is a bit of panic in the news rooms of the news channels
 ankar inhen janata samajhakar inaki bhashaa bolne lagate hai, or jab ye chup ho jate hai, to vah mudda channelon se gaayab ho jaataa he
 For example, the officer released on bail in Gujarat was made the Chief of Police
 ise lekar in samarthakon ne media ko gaali nahin di ki aap chup kyon hai, jabaki jis vyakti ko hataaya gaya he, vah khuleam kah rahaa he ki unhone pad se hataane kii guzarish nahin kii thi
 He should not be removed from the post of Chief of Police
 diji vanjaaraa jail se chhootakar aate hai, or saarvajanik rup se talwaar lekar dance karte hai
 He calls himself a patriot and thanks other patriots
 yahi ghatana agar kisi duusare rajya main hui hoti, to ye log galigalouj kaa ambara laga dete ki media bik gaya he
 The journalist is a thief, a broker
 sattadhari dal ke saathi sanghathanon or samarthakon ko afvaah failaane or galigalouj karne kii chhot he
 His words also caused tension among the people, but now they also started to understand what to trust and not

 If people do not warn, then this medium will be snatched from their hands

 The The Indian Express has published on Sunday that for the first time in India, a water train ran in Rajkot, Gujarat on May 2, 1986
 mujhe kisi ne soochna di thi ki '50 ke dashak main elahabaad se bundelkhand ke manikpur ke bich pani kii rail chalati thi
 i have not been able to confirm this information, but how are the people of the government speaking so easily that for the first time the water train has run

 Riots erupted in London a few years ago
 police ne paaya ki soshal media ke jariye kuch baaten failaai gai hai
 Instead of shutting down internet service, the police started spreading its message to the people
 nateeja yah hua ki hinsa tham gai
 a report was made about whether the Internet sparked riots
 zarurat he ki ham is afvaah samskruti ke raajnneetik paksh ko ujagar karen or sahi tathyon se muqabla karen
 Turning off the Internet should be the last resort, not the first step

 chembar of trade and industry (CTI) negisticouncil auravitt mantriarun jetali se maang kii he kikerala main badhke baad hue nuksaan ko dekhte hue GST tex main sanshodhan kiya jaae
 The CTI says that there has been a lot of loss of life and property due to floods in Kerala, in such a situation, the traders of Kerala should be saved from tax
 sitiai ke sanyojak brijesh goyal ke mutabik kerala ke vyapaariyon ko keval stock kiye maal kaa hi nahin balki jiesti ke tahat milane vaale input tex credit yani itisi kaa bhi nuksaan uthaanaa hoga kyonki niyam ke tahat agar koi maal kharida jaataa he or vah yadi chori ho jaataa he yaa kharaab ho jaataa he to phir us maal par kisi tarah kaa itisi nahin miltaa
 That is, the traders will have to face the tax along with the loss of goods
 CTI ne jiesti council, kendriya vitt mantri sahit kerala ke siem ko bhi patr likhaa he
 It is written in the letter that due to natural calamity in Kerala, the traders there are in bad condition
 aise main jiesti ke niyamon main sanshodhan karte hue vyapaariyon ko kam se kam tex kii maar se bachaaya jaae
 According to the Chamber of Trade and Industry under section 17 (5) (i) of the GST Act, if the goods purchased are lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed, the input tax credit included in the purchase of the purchase will not be given to the buyer
 
 chambar of trade industry ke vyapaariyon ne udahaaran dekar bataaya ki maan lijiye kerala kii ek company ne dilli kii company se maal kharida
 The cost of goods was Rs 8 lakh and GST was imposed on it at Rs 2 lakh, so the invoice was Rs 10 lakh
 dilli kii company ne kerala kii company se puure 10 lakh rupee le liye or usamen se do lakh kaa jiesti jamaa kara diya
 That means the government got 2 lakh rupees as GST
 ab jab kerala kii company us maal ko bechegi to use input tex credit ke taur par 2 lakh rupee sarkaar se waapas milenge
 But due to the flow of goods in the flood, the Kerala company has bills but no goods
 isaliye is bill kaa itisi 2 lakh rupee kerala kii company ko nahin milegaa
 That is, the loss to the Kerala company was one million
 ab agar sarkaar 17(5)(i) se chhot de to nuksaan ghat kar sirf aath lakh rah jayega, jo ki maal kii keemat thi
 Traders believe that under Section 17 (5) (i) it is clear that ITC will not be available on the goods which are destroyed
 lekin yahaan parprakritik aapadaaka maamla he
 In such a situation, the government can make amendments only under the rules
 iske liye jiesti ke section 11 main sarkaar ke paas yah adhikaar he ki vah chaahe to kisi bhi niyam main sanshodhan kar sakati he
 In the heroic story of alha-oodal it is said, 'those who are great fighters, do not kill them right away
 
 ! ' 831 years ago, Delhi King Prithviraj Chauhan marched on the kingdom of Chandela ruler Raja Paramala Dev's kingdom Mahoba with the intention of getting Princess Chandraval and looting the Paras stone and Naulakha necklace
 yuddh mahoba ke kirat sagar maidan main hua tha, jisamen aalha-oodal kii talwaar kii dhar ke aage vah tik na sake
 Due to the war, the daughters of Bundelkhand were able to bury 'kajali' on the second day of Rakshabandhan
 aalha-oodal kii virgatha ke pratik aitihaasik kajli meley ko yahaan 'vijay utsav' ke rup main manaane kii parampara aaj bhi jivit he
 Who does not know Alha and Udal, who were the commanders of the Chandel rulers of the princely state of Mahoba
 san 1181 main urai ke raja mamaa maahil ke kehane par raja parmaal dev ne apane donon senapatiyon (aalha-oodal) ko rajya se nishkasit kar diya tha, jiske baad donon ne kannauj ke raja lakhan rana ke yahaan sharan le lee thi
 As soon as Prithviraj, the King of Delhi marched on Mahoba, when Princess Chandrawal (daughter of King Paramal), riding in Dola on the day of Rakshabandhan, arrived with her friends to bury Kajali in Kirat Sagar
 yuddh rokane ke liye prithviraj ne raja parmaal se beti chandraval, paras pathari or naulakha haar saunpane kii shart rakhi
 This condition was like accepting slavery, so there was no option but to fight and after the fierce battle between the two armies broke out in the same plain of Kirat Sagar, the daughters of Bundelkhand could not bury Kajali that day
 rajkumaari chandraval ne bhi apni saheliyon ke saath virdohi sena kaa muqabla kiya tha
 Paramal's son, Prince Abhai, was martyred in this war
 jab yah khabar kannauj pahunchi to aalha, oodal or kannauj naresh lakhan ne sadhuvesh main kirat sagar ke maidan main pahunchakar prithviraj kii sena ko parajeet kar diya
 As a symbol of the victory of Bundeli Raja Paramal in this war and the heroic story of Alha and his younger brother Udal, it has become a tradition to celebrate the historic Kajali Mela as 'vijay Utsav' at the government expense at Kirat Sagar Maidan every year
 khaas baat yah he ki us yuddh ke kaaran puure ilaake main rakshabandhan duusare din manaaya jaataa he
 Historian Radhakrishna Bundeli states, 'this tradition of celebrating Mahoba's Kajali Mela, associated with the heroic story of Alha and Udal, is a' Vijay Utsav 'every year
 ' vah bataate hai ki samooche bundelkhand main mahoba yuddh ke kaaran duusare din kajli dafna kar rakshabandhan manaane kaa rivaaj he
 Dr
 Kajal, the District Magistrate of Mahoba, says, 'this is the historic fair of Mahoba, which is organized every year on the budget of the Nagar Palika Parishad
 teen agast se shuru hone vaala kajli mela ek saptaah tak chalegaa
 The District Magistrate said that about one and a half lakh people are expected to reach this fair from far and wide
 logon kii suraksha ke pukhta intjaam kiye jaaenge or logon ko kisi prakaar kii dikkat na ho, iske liye vibhinn vibhaagon ke aalaa adhikariyon kii timen gathit kii gai hai
 Pushpa Anuragi, chairperson of the Nagar Palika Parishad, says that in addition to the program of Ghazal singer Anoop Jalota and Bundeli folklore Emperor Deshraj Pateria, the National Poet Conference and Mushaira will also be organized
 vah kahati hai ki yah mahoba hi nahin, samooche bundelkhand ke gauravshaalee itihaas kaa sabase bada or mahatvapurn utsav he
