 In the late 90s the flyover showed a dream of speed and freedom from jam
 netaaon ne fliover khub banawaye or thekedaaron ne rashtranirmaan ke naam par apana nirmaan kar liya
 Barring an exception, most flyovers have failed to free the city from traffic
 aaj dilli main 90 se adhik fliover ban jane ke baad bhi jam kii vahi sthiti he
 They jam over the flyover
 haalat yah he ki parivahan mantri nitin gadakari kaa bayaan chapa he ki unhone dilli ko jam se mukti dilaane ke liye 50,000 karod kaa road map banaaya he
 The cost of three phases of the metro in Delhi itself is more than 70 thousand crores
 200 kimi metro line bich jane ke baad bhi dilli main 50,000 karod chahie jam se mukti ke liye
 You can say that if this had not happened, the situation in Delhi would have been terrible, perhaps even right, but even after this, is the situation in Delhi not terrible? subah subah aap radio aan kiijie, har epa em par jam kii traahi traahi varnan chal rahaa hota he

 china main bhi bullate train kaa vishaal network he
 But it is said that common people in China prefer to walk in an ordinary train or walk in a bullet train
 bullate train ne china kii arthvyavastha ko khub chusaa he
 Many rich countries in Europe have abandoned the idea of bullet train
 germany ne bhi sochaa magar chhod diya
 There is a lot of discussion about this in America as well
 jab ve log jinaki prati vyakti aay bharat se adhik he bullate train ko lekar utsahit nahin hai, bharat kyon hai
 France had loaned Argentina in 2008 for a bullet train
 lekin vahaan virodh hone laga ki isse koi laabh nahin
 Argentina is now improving its network with the help of China and has given up the idea of bullet train
 isse puure desh ke network ko laabh mil rahaa he or kharchaa bhi kam ho rahaa he
 But it is also true that the bullet train network is successful in Japan
 iske kaaran tokyo shahar main dur dur se log aate hai
 Companies also pay for the fare of the bullet train
 japan kaa anubhav pachaas saal kaa hone ja rahaa he
 If there are examples of failure then the success of Japan can also be learned

 times aaf india kii ek report ke anusaar disambar 2015 main rail rajya mantri manoj sinha ne elaan kiya tha ki vadodara main neshnal academy aaf indian railway kii sthapana hogi
 On 22 October 2016, the Prime Minister went to inaugurate the terminal building of Vadodara Airport, when he announced India's first railway university
 jabaki farvari 2016-17 ke bajet main hi vadodara main rail uniwarsity kii baat ho chuki thi

 It is being said that technical training has started in Vadodara regarding the bullet train
 hamaare sahyogi rajeev pathak ne bullate train ke project nideshak se poocha ki is pariyojna par kaam kab shuru hoga
 The transport between the city and the transport between the two cities cannot be compared
 bullate train lambii duuri ke do shaharon ke bich kii baat he
 China also has a huge network of bullet trains
 lekin kaha jaataa he ki china main aam log saadhaaran train main hi chalanaa pasand karte hai yaa bullate train main chalanaa sabake bas kii baat nahin he
 The bullet train has sucked China's economy a lot
 europe ke kai amir deshon main bullate train kaa idia chhod diya he
 Germany too thought but left
 america main bhi ise lekar kaaphi charchaa hui he
 Why are India when people whose per capita income is more than India are not enthusiastic about bullet train
 france ne 2008 main argetina ko bullate train ke liye lone diya tha
 But there started protesting that there was no benefit from it
 argentina ab china kii madad se apane network ko behatar kar rahaa he or bullate train kaa idia chhod chukaa he
 Due to this, the network of the entire country is benefiting and the expenses are also being reduced
 lekin yah bhi sahi he ki japan main bullate train kaa network safal he
 Due to this, people come from far and wide in Tokyo city
 companiyaan bullate train ke kiraaye kaa kharchaa bhi detii hai
 Japan's experience is going to be fifty years old
 agar naakaami ke udhaaharan hai to japan kii kamyaabi se bhi siikhaa ja saktaa he

 jab bhi bainkon ke paas fund kii kami hoti he, to ve isaki bharpai karne ke liye kendriya bank se paise lete hai
 This loan given by RBI is available at a fixed rate

 yah report na keval pratidwandvita kii baat karti he balki sahyog kii baat bhi karti he
 Burroughs said that in this context, there are many opportunities for the United States, India, China and other countries to cooperate on the security of the sea route

 bharat ke tamaam log 21 november ko subah-subah is khabar se chaunk gaye ki 2008 main mumbai par hue aatanki hamale kaa ekmaatr jinda aatankwaadi ajmal kasaab ko faansee de di gai he
 The government carried out Operation x without much fanfare
 iske tahat puri gopneeyata barat kar subah 7
 Kasab was hanged at 30
 pakistani naagarik kasaab ke mrityudand par amal karne main sarkaar ne asaamaanya or abhootpurv dridhtaa kaa parichay diya grih mantri susheel kumaar scindia ne jab iske kuch samay baad media se baat karte hue ghatana kaa vivaran diya to unka utsaah dekhne laayak tha
 He said, "kasab's mercy petition was canceled by President Pranab Mukherjee on 5 November
 tab main (ek interpol sammelan ke liye) rome gaya hua tha
 On returning on November 7, i signed it immediately
 agle din maine ise maharashtra sarkaar ko bhej diya
 Shinde also said that it was necessary to give a strong message on terrorism
 mukherjee ne bhi saaf kar diya ki ve mahaj naam ke raashtrapati nahin rahenge
 If he wished, he would sit quietly without taking any decision on Kasab's file, as Pratibha Patil did before him in two dozen cases during his five-year tenure
 grih mantralay ne kasaab kii dayaa yachika 23 aktubar ko radd kar di thi
 Mukherjee made his decision in less than two weeks
 yah is baat kii bhi jhalak he ki loksabhaa chunaav ke samay se purv hone kii sambhaavnaaon ke jor maarane ke bich sarkaar apane rukh ko sakht bana rahi he
 This hanging shocked Pakistan and BJP also kept wondering what to react
 videsh mantri salmaan khurshid ne daawa kiya ki pakistan sarkaar ko kasaab kii faansee se pehle is bare main bataa diya gaya tha or kutanyik madhyam se kasaab ke parivaar ko sandesh bheja gaya tha
 Khurshid told a TV channel, "I hope this will send a message to the world that the law is respected in India
" beshak vyakti bhartiya naagarik ho yaa nahin
 We have done our responsibility
 ab ummid he ki pakistan bhi kanoon kaa saath detaa dikhegaa
 "india realized that this would not be the right opportunity to receive Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik, and requested him on 20 November to postpone his visit to India on 22-23 November
" pakistani paksh ne haal main udaar banaae gaye bharat-pakistan vija samjhaute ko lagu karne ke liye in tarikhon kaa prastaav rakhaa tha
 The new agreement will replace the 38-year-old visa agreement, paving the way for visa approvals in a time-bound manner
 isse donon mulkon ke logon ko aapas main ghulne-milane or vyapaar karne ke zyada maukey milenge
 Now this visit does not seem to be happening soon because India has not given any suggestion about new dates
 haalaaki bharat sarkaar ne 22 november se shuru ho rahe sansad satr ko malik kii agavaani nahin kar paane kaa kaaran bataaya, lekin scindia 26 / 11 kii barsi se thik pehle unase galabahiyaan karte nahin dikhnaa chaahate the
 Sources say that the failure of the Pakistan government to punish those involved in this terrorist attack was the main reason
 is oparation kii jaankaree keval unheen ko thi, jinhen is bare main jaananaa jaruri tha
 Khurshid was aware of this because it included diplomatic aspects
 is oparation kii gati or gopneeyata bakhubi bani rahi
 Shinde said about this, "the government did not want anything untoward to happen before hanging
" ” lekin grih mantri ek baat par jarur gadabada gaye
 When the media asked him if the Prime Minister knew about Kasab's execution on November 21, Shinde said, "no, no
" keval grih mantralay or raashtrapati ko isaki jaankaree thi
 This matter was later cut by Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan, who told TV channels that the Prime Minister was aware of the decision
 is ek gafalat ko chhod den to 18 sitambar ko kasaab kii dayaa yachika ke raashtrapati ke paas aane se lekar faansee die jane tak kii puri prakriya keval do maah main nibat gai
 While the mercy petition of Afzal Guru, convicted for the 2001 attack on Parliament, has been pending since October 2006
 bijepi ne afjal guru kaa mudda uthaakar congress ke gubaare kii hawa ko nikaalnaa chaha
 Soon after the hanging, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, "what did Afzal Guru do, who attacked the Parliament of our democracy, Parliament in 2001?" His crime dates back years before Kasab's hateful act
 ”darasal mrityudand kii qatari main khadey aparaadhiyon kii lambii suchi ko darkinar karke kasaab par faisla liya gaya
 Of the 15 mercy petitions pending, Kasab's number is the last
 is suchi main afjal chathe number par tha
 In June 2009, the then Law Minister M
 virappa moili ne kaha tha, ‘‘aap kisi ko alag se chunakar faansee par nahin chadha sakate
 "he said that this order cannot be broken
" jaahir he ki ab aisa nahin rah gaya he
 The Manmohan government wanted to avoid the image that it is soft on terrorism, weak in implementation or unable to take decisive steps
 congress netaaon ne bhale hi is faansee par chaati thokane yaa shrey lene se parhez kiya ho, lekin unhone bijepi se ek mudda jarur chin liya
 But he definitely acknowledged that Afzal's issue will now become a political focal point
 sutron ne bataaya ki mukherjee baaki lambit maamalon ko bhi turant nipataane ke paksh main hai
 "they have also sent the remaining 14 files back to the Ministry of Home Affairs for clarification," said a Home Ministry official
 ye maamle unki purvavarti pratibha patil ke paas lambey samay se atake the
 They want the Home Ministry to take a fresh view on these
 ”haalanki congress ke liye baaki maamle itane aasaan nahin honge
 a senior lawyer said that UPA is in a position to speak up about Kasab being a foreigner as he was different from others in the death row
 unhone kaha, ‘‘afjal ke maamle main yah itnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 It can affect the vote bank
 ” lekin congress par guru ko faansee dene kaa dabaav jarur bad gaya he
 It has to take a balanced step keeping political risk in mind
 in varisht vakil ne kaha, ‘‘agar ve afjal ko faansee nahin dete to yah is baat ko sweekaar kar lene jaisaa hoga ki kasaab ek aasaan lakshya tha
 If they hang him, the Congress has to be careful about its political consequences and the risk of losing an important vote bank
 ”kasaab ko 21 november ko faansee dene kaa faisla 8 november ko suraksha maamalon kii cabinet cameti (sisies) main liya gaya tha, jisamen manmohan singh, scindia, vitt mantri pi
 Chidambaram and Rehana Minister A
 ke
 Antony was involved
 sutron ke mutabik, sisies ne kasaab ko 26 november ko hi faansee dene ke bare main vichaar kiya tha, jo aatanki hamale kii barsi thi
 But ccs's decision was against it because it seems that India wants to prove something
 sarkari sutron ne kaha, ‘‘ise turant or bina ho-halle ke nipataane kaa faisla kiya gaya
 “maharashtra has only two hanging jails - Nagpur Central Jail and Pune's Yerawada Jail
 yeravada ko isliye chunaa gaya kyonki yah mumbai ke najadik he, jahaan kasaab ko arthur road jail main rakhaa gaya tha
 Kasab was informed of the hanging on November 12 by a prison official
 sutron ke mutabik, kasaab yah sunakar foot padaa or kehane laga, ‘‘allaah kasam, aisi galati dobaaraa nahin karuunga
 May Allah forgive me
 ” is adhikari ne bataaya, ‘‘usne hamase kaha ki pakistan main uski ammi ko uski faansee ke bare main bataa diya jaae
 Kasab's mother Noori Lai expressed his desire to come to India in April 2009 to meet him
 par unke aane kii baat rajanyik prakriyaaon main ulajhakar rah gai
 On November 5, officials of Arthur Road Jail spread the news that Kasab had fever
 aisi atakalbaaji thi ki use dengue ho gaya he
 It is said that he underwent a complete medical examination and a blood test, which revealed that he had no dengue or any other infection
 ab yah saaf lagata he ki jail adhikariyon ne dengue ke bahaane yah pareekshan kara liya ki vah faansee dene ke liye chikitsakeey rup se swasth he yaa nahin
 In India, it is imperative that the person is tested for health before being hanged
 faansee se ek ghante pehle bhi aakhri kshanon main uski medical jaanch kii gai
 Kasab was airlifted from Mumbai to Pune in the early hours of 19 November in a special aircraft
 is puure abhiyaan kii nigaraanee rajya police ke 10 varisht adhikariyon ne kii, jinamein dijipi sanjeev dayaal, ijeepi deven bharti or sanyukt ayukta himanshu raay shaamil the
 When he reached Kasab's cell in Arthur Road Jail, he looked scared
 ek adhikari ne bataaya, ‘‘chaar saal main pehali baar hamane uske chehre par dar dekha
 Prison officials read Kasab's home ministry order about his hanging
 yeravada jail adhikariyon ko supurd karne se pehle aadesh par hastakshar karaae gaye
 Yerwada jail authorities saw Kasab 'upset' just before he was hanged on the morning of 21 November
 usne ek minute ke liye ibaadat kii or adhikariyon se poocha ki kya uske parivaar ko uski faansee ke bare main bataa diya gaya he
 He did not write a will, nor stated any last wish
 sutron ke mutabik, kasaab ne faansee kii khabar milane ke baad apane aakhri nau dinon main zyada bhavanaaen nahin dikhain
 "he stayed in his special cell and did not talk to anyone as before," said a source
 ”kasaab ne apane aakhri minute ibaadat karke bitaye
 He did not state any special last wish, nor did he want to talk to anyone in his house
 jab use bataa diya gaya ki ab or kisi apil kii gunjaaish baaki nahin he, to vah ‘shant or ghabaraaya hua’ faansee ke takht kii ore badha
 The lone terrorist caught alive in the 26 / 11 attack on Mumbai was buried in the same compound after hanging as no one claimed to have taken his body
 asipi dilip maane ne kaha, ‘‘itane saare nirdosh logon kii hatya karne vaale kaa yahi sahi ant tha
 When Mane heard about this hanging at his house in Panvel, he jumped from his chair
 government railway police ke senior inspector ke rup main chhatrapati shivaji terminus par 26 november, 2008 kii raat ko maane ne bheed ke bich bikhrin laashon ko dekha tha
 They say that the faces of the injured passengers and their screams had ripped their minds
 ajmal kasaab or ismail khan goliyaan barasaate or grenade phenkate hue stesan ke andar aae
 They killed 58 people and injured 104
 mumbai ke aatanki hamale main maare gaye 166 logon main se ek tihaai logon ko unhone hi maaraa
 Kasab and Khan continued the killings even after exiting the station

 Social worker Kishore Bhatt was among those who first saw Kasab in police custody late on 26 November 2008
 bhatta ne kaha, ‘‘use ilaaj ke liye nair hospital laayaa gaya tha
 He was pleading with the policemen to kill me, my mission is complete

 america raashtrapati baraak obama ne vivaadaaspad drone hamalon ko aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf aatmaraksha ke liye ‘nyyochit, prabhavi or aavashyak’ qaraar dete hue apni nai aatankwaad-nirodhak nitiyon kii ghoshnaa kii jisamen pakistan jaise deshon main drone ke istemaal ko simit kiya gaya he
 Obama, in a speech against counter-terrorism policies at the National Defense University, said he would reduce the use of drones, close the terrorist detention center in Guantanamo Bay and try to impose new limits on his own combat power
 obama ne pehali baar nijee taur par yah baat sweekaar kii ki drone hamalon main videshon main rah rahe kai america bhi maare gaye hai lekin unhone maanav rahit sashastr vimaan ‘drone’ ke istemaal ko mahatvapurn aatanki thikaanon ko nishaanaa banane ke liye ‘kanoonee’ or behad ‘prabhavi’ hathiyaar bataaya
 In this way he indicated that his administration would continue to use drones in the war against terrorism
 america raashtrapati ne kaha, ‘ham ek aise sanghathan se yuddhrat hai jise yadi ham pehle nahin rokte to vah utane americanyon ko maar daalega jitne ko maar saktaa he
 'he said,' Therefore it is justified, it is a battle that is being fought for self-defense and as a last resort
 ’obama ne is baat kii pushti kii ki unhone drone hamalon ke liye ek din pehle dishanirdesh par hastakshar kiye the
 Under this, attacks will only be authorized against terrorists which are a 'continuous and imminent threat' to the Americans and these attacks will be done only when there is 'almost certainty' that civilians will not be killed or injured in this attack
 Will be unhone kaha ki drone hamalon se hone vaali nagarikon kii maut unhen ‘pareshaan’ karti he lekin unhone yah bhi kaha ki yah jokhim aatanki samoohon se maujuud un khataron ke aadhaar par santulit ho janaa chahie, jo khaastaur par nagarikon ko apana nishaanaa banaate hai
 He said, 'doing nothing is not an option
 ’ obama ne kaha ki afghanistan se pare america sirf alqaida or uske samarthak balon ko hi nishaanaa banaata he or dronon kaa istemaal ek badi majaburi he
 Obama refused to accept the commando campaign to kill Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden as a standard, saying the US respects the sovereignty of other countries
 unhone kaha ki us tarah ke (bin laden ko maarane ke liye chalaaye gayi abhiyaan jaise) abhiyaan maanak nahin ho sakate
 Obama said, 'our campaign against Osama bin Laden in Pakistan cannot be the norm
 is maamle main bahut jokhim the
 Our priority was to catch it, although that possibility was very low
 yah tay tha ki hamaare logon ko baadhaon kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 'they said,' We did not kill civilians nor did we get involved in an extensive war
 yah hamaare vishesh balon kii behtareen yojana or peshevraana vyavhaar kaa nateeja tha lekin yah sab kismat par bhi nirbhar karata he
 It was supported by extensive infrastructure in Afghanistan
 ’unhone america ko ek doraahe par khadaa bataakar isaki aatankwaad-nirodhak ranneeti main badlaav kii bhi baat kahi
 Obama said, "our battle is now entering a new phase, so America's rational claim of self-defense cannot end this entire discussion
 sainya vikalp ko vaid yaa prabhavi bataane kaa arth yah kahana nahin he ki yah vikalp har sthiti main budhimattapurna yaa naitik he
 The progress that has given us the technology to attack almost half the world, it also wants to discipline control of this power
 varanaa iske durupyog ke khatre ko jhelane ke liye taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 'obama said,' So in the last four years, my administration worked vigorously to establish a framework for the use of our forces against terrorists
 is ruparekha main spasht dishanirdesh, duuradrushti or javabdehi par jor diya gaya he
 It is included in the President's policy directives which i have signed
 ’obama ne kaha ki america ke ‘aatank ke khilaaf yuddh’ main sashastr drone ek pramukh hathiyaar ban gaya he lekin inke upyog ke kaaran vyaavhaarik tarkon se pare kai jatil kanoonee or aacharan vaale mudde uthte hai ki drone hamale prabhavi hai bhi ki nahin
 The US president said, "we have to support our troops in the Afghan war until the end of 2014, when the transfer of power is complete
" iskaa arth he ki ham alqaida ke thikaanon or un takaton ke khilaaf drone hamale jari rakhenge jo gathbandhan balon par hamalon kaa samarthan karte hai
 He said, "if we have the ability to catch terrorists alone, then America does not carry out drone strikes
" hamaari praathamikta hameshaa se yah rahi he ki ham unhen pakaden, poochtacha karen or phir unke upar abhiyog chalaaen
 America cannot attack anywhere on its own free will
 ’obama ne kaha, ‘hamen apane prayaason ko ‘aatankwaad ke khilaaf bandhanrahit vaishvik yuddh’ (boundleys global waar on teror) nahin kahana chahie balki yah america ke liye khatra bane un hinsak charampanthiyon ke vishesh networkon ko khatm karne ke liye lakshith or satat prayaason kii siries he
 In many cases it will also involve other countries
 ’guantanamo ke mudde par obama ne kaha ki unhone bandiyon ko yaman bheje jane par varsh 2010 main roak lagaai thi jise ab vah hataa rahe hai

 unhone kaha ki vah videsh mantralay main ek nayaa rajdoot or raksha mantralay main ek adhikari niyukt karenge, jo guantanamo ke bandiyon ke sthanantaran par duusare deshon se baatcheet karenge
 He said that he is removing restrictions on transfer of some prisoners
 obama ne ise (guantanamo hiraasat centre ko) apane karyaalay ke pehle hi saal band karne kii baat kahi thi
 But their efforts were thwarted by Republican lawmakers who opposed the prosecution of terrorism suspects in the US and countries that refused to take some detainees

 pehla bajet 2014-15vitt varsh 2014 kii shuruyaat main jahaan sattarudh manmohan sarkaar ne antarim bajet pesh kiya vahiin june-july main kendra main sthapit hui nai modi sarkaar ne apana pehla bajet pesh kiya
 Presenting this budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that the people of the country have elected a new government to completely eradicate poverty from the country through fast economic growth
 jetali ke mutabik 2014 ke chunaav nateezon ke jariye desh kii sava sau karod janata ne berogari, ghatiya mul-bhoot suvidhaon, jarjar infrastracchar or bhrasht prashasan ke khilaaf bigul phoonk diya
 Therefore, the Modi government, through its first budget, put the country's economy on the track of growth of 7-8 per cent growth and gave the basic mantra of SAB SAAT SAB
 doosraa bajet 2015-16apana doosraa bajet pesh karte hue vitt mantri arun jetali ne sansad main daawa kiya ki modi sarkaar ke 9 maheenon ke kaarykaal ke dauraan bhartiya arthvyavastha kii saakh majboot hui he
 With this, Jaitley said that the Indian economy is ready to pick up pace
 jetali ne sansad main bajet pesh karte hue kaha ki modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal main bharat duniya kii sabase tej raftaar daudane vaali arthvyavastha ban chuki he or is vakt jidipi kii nai siries ke mutabik vikaas dar kaa 7
 Estimated 4 percent
 ise padhein: BUDGET 2018: aam logon ke liye nahin rahaa ab desh kaa aam bajtis bajet main kendra sarkaar ne 12 karod se adhik pariwaron ko aarthik mukhyadhara main laane kaa daawa kiya or desh kii aarthik saakh ko majboot karne ke liye paardarshee kol block aavanton ko anjaam diya
 In this budget, the central government moved towards drastic economic reforms to launch GST and direct benefit transfer through Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile
 teesraa bajet 2016-17is bajet se pehle vaishvik str par chunautiyon main ijapha hone ke baavjood kendra sarkaar ke saamne growth ke achche aankade maujuud the
 The International Monetary Fund declared India a bright spot among the sluggish global economies
 is bajet main kendra sarkaar ke saamne vaishvik susti ke alaava bade gharelu kharch badi chunauti rahe
 While the budget had to incur huge expenditure to make the benefits of the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission available to the employees, the agriculture sector was in a big crisis due to weak monsoon in the country for two consecutive years
 ise padhein: iconomic survey 2018: doguni chhodie, in kaarnon se ek-chauthai kam ho sakati he kisaanon kii aamadaneelihaaja, kendra sarkaar ke saamne pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana lagu karnaa bhi bade kharch main shaamil hua
 However, even in this budget, the government did not have a tough revenue challenge to spend as the state treasury was benefiting from weak crude oil prices globally
 chauthaa bajet: 2017-18modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal main chauthaa bajet pesh karne se pehle desh main kaledhan par lagaam ke liye notebandi jaisaa ahm faisla liya gaya
 After this decision, the shrinking demand in front of the annual budget became a big challenge
 jahaan beete do bajaton ke dauraan desh main growth ne raftaar pakadi thi is bajet main kendra sarkaar ke saamne chunautiyaan bad rahi thi
 In this budget, the central government was once again troubled by rising crude oil prices
 iske alaava july 2017 ke dauraan desh main jiesti lagu karne se growth ko jhatka lagane kaa sanket milane laga tha
 In such a situation where the Reserve Bank of India was constantly avoiding cutting interest rates, there was a fear of changing the attitude of foreign investors in the US, indicating that interest rates would increase

 sansad kaa bajet satr shuru hone se thik pehle hi congress ne bajet ko lekar apni ranneeti saaf kar di thi
 Senior party spokesperson RPN Singh announced that the budget would mean rain of jumalas
 congress ne apane tevar buudhvaar ko us vakt bhi dikhaa die jab pradhanmantri narendra modi loksabhaa main raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par dhanyavad charchaa main bolne ke liye khadey hue
 Even before the Prime Minister spoke in the House, TDP mps from Andhra Pradesh had come out in the Well shouting slogans demanding special status for the state
 jaise hi piem bolne ke liye khadey hue, unhone saath hi baithe grih mantri rajnath singh kii taraf dekha
 Rajnath Singh hinted at reassuring the PM that slogans would now go to their seats
 iske baad sansadeey kaarymantri anant hegade or arjuna meghavaal ne naare lagane vaale tidipi saansadon se apni siton par jane kii guzarish bhi kii
 This had an impact and TDP mps started moving towards their seats
 tidipi saansadon ko siton kii ore lautate dekh kuch congress saansadon ne tanj ksaa ki ab andhra ko vishesh darja nahin chahie, phixing ho gai
 On this, Congress mps Jyotiraditya Scindia and Venugopal also had some disputes with TDP mps
 jaise hi andhra ke saansad apni siton par pahunche, congress alaakaman kaa ishaara milte hi party saansad wel main aa gaye
 After this, the Prime Minister kept giving speeches for one and a half hours and till he said Congress MP kept shouting loud slogans in the well
 wo naare laga rahe the- rafel deal main kya hua? rojgaar kaa kya hua, kisaanon kaa kya hua, 15 lakh kaa kya hua, jumalebaji band karo, jhooth bolnaa band karo aadi
 Along with shouting slogans, he also kept showing placards about Rafael
 piem modi ne is shor sharabe ke bich hi apana bhaashan puraa kiya
 As soon as the pm's speech was over, Sonia Gandhi retaliated against Modi by talking to the media without a camera and Rahul talking on camera
 loksabhaa main congress kaa aakraamak ravaiya dekhakar yahi laga ki rajyasabha main to bijepi ke paas bahumat nahin he, aise main yahaan to jab modi bolenge to congress saansad mushkilen or badhayenge
 But exactly the opposite happened
 loksabhaa kii tarj par modi ne rajyasabha main apane bhaashan main nehru- gandhi parivaar or congress par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 Corruption and the name of Bofors, the grand old party was a lot of shame
 lekin loksabhaa ke ulat congressi saansad main wel main nahin aaye
 He continued to pay the rituals of opposition by commenting occasionally
 aise main loksabhaa ke najaare ke baad jo kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki rajyasabha main piem modi ke bhaashan ke dauraan bada hangaamaa hoga, aisa kuch nahin hua
 According to party sources, during the pm's speech in the Rajya Sabha, he has his pain of not creating a ruckus in the well
 darasal, rajyasabha main congress kii dikkat ye he ki, upree sadan main congress ke zyaadaatar netaa yaa to bujurg hai yaa phir bahut senior hai
 In such a situation, it is not possible to have continuous commotion or shouting slogans for so long
 ek varisht netaa ne 'aaj tak' ko bataaya kiloksabhaa main congress ke passushmita dev, ranjit ranjan, gaurav gogoi, deependra hooda , ninong iring, kasee venugopal, ke suresh, rajeev saatav or jyotiraditya sindhiya jaise kai yuva hai
 In the Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Ahmed Patel, Ambika Soni, Anand Sharma, Jairam Ramesh, P
K
 chidambaram, manmohan singh, eke antni, mohasina kidawai, digvijay singh sareekhe bujurg or varisht netaa hai
 The rest of the Congress members in the Rajya Sabha are also quite old
 upree sadan main 60 saal kii umr ke aasapaas ke netaaon main renuka choudhary, rajeev gauda, kumari shailaja, rajeev shukla hi hai
 Overall, the Congress has a tota of youth in the Rajya Sabha
 aisi sthiti main congress ko rajyasabha main sarkaar ko gherne ke liye ranneeti banaate vakt aage bhi aaj jaisi dikkat se do-chaar hona pad saktaa he
 Further accentuating the protest against the Center, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister n Kiran Kumar Reddy challenged it to table the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Bill 2013 in the same manner as sent by the state assembly
 kiran kumaar ne chunauti di, 'main unhen usee vidheyak ko sansad main rakhane kii chunauti detaa hum, jo hamane bheja he

 Ganesha is the first worshiper of all the deities
 inaki krupa se har vighn kaa naash hota he or har kaary main safalataa milti he
 Everything from education to children is possible with his grace
 yahaan tak ki maatr inaki murti yaa chitra ke prayog se ghar ke vaastu dosha ko nasht kiya ja saktaa he
 Different colored idols are used in the worship of Ganesha
 alag alag rang ke ye ganpati har kaamana puri karne main sakasham hai
 Yellow Ganpati - These are six arms, and are called Haridra Ganapathi - they are yellow like turmeric or made of turmeric - they should be installed at the main place of worship in the house - they are worshiped in all kinds There is happiness in the house, prosperity comes in the house
 There are many Ganesha of red color - red or blood color - but only the four arms of the blood vessel, Ganesh ji are mainly worshiped
 जाता It is called Sankhtaharan Ganapati- They should be established either in their place of worship or in the place of work - by offering them Durva, every crisis is averted by praying white Ganpati- These Ganesh ji are called Shubhra Ganapati or Dwij Ganapati
 - These are four white colored arms - their worship brings blessings of knowledge, knowledge and wisdom - they are founded by students, Students should do it at their place of reading - success is ensured by studying and remembering it before the examination
 The blue-colored Ganesh ji - these Ganesh ji are called "pickled Ganapati", it is the four blue colored arms - normal They are not worshiped in conditions - their worship is special worship of Tantra, in which there is no consideration of purification and impurity - to attain high position, to attain desire and to avoid Tantra mantra
 So their worship is special - do not worship them without the direction of a Sadhguru: Rochan Mochan Ganapathi - The color of these Ganesha is yellow - but they are four arms and wear red clothes - they are at their work place
 Install - light a lamp of ghee in front of them regularly - pray for debt relief, never benefit, insult the mother, Otherwise, you will have to suffer these miseries - these Ganesha keep all the forms within them - they are Trinetradhari, Raktavarna and Ten Bhujadhari - They are not normally worshiped - on the occasion of Ganesh festival or in the temple itself
 Worship is excellent - by remembering and worshiping them at the Ganesh festival, the blessing of children is easily attained, which gods and goddesses will fulfill The desire ruthik roshan kii apakaming film super 30 coposterjari kiya gaya he

 Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh had promised the people of Punjab during the election campaign that drugs would be eliminated from Punjab within 4 weeks of his government formation and strict action against drug smugglers operating in Punjab
 Will

 Captain Amarinder Singh has given the ADGP a complete open exemption from Punjab for drug elimination within the next 4 weeks and has to report all the action on the day-to-day basis directly to the CM office
 saath hi captain amarinder singh ne edijipi harprit siddhu ko saaf kar diya he ki agar nashe ke kaarobaar main koi bhi rajaneta yaa rasukhdaar vyakti sanlipt paaya jaae to use bhi kisi bhi haal yaa kisi bhi sifarish ke baavjood choda naa jaae or uske khilaaf turant kaarywahi kii jaae
 However, the Captain said that since the formation of the government, the Punjab Police has been taking strict action against the drug dealers and in the last 10 days, more than 200 drug smugglers have been caught by the police
 akali dal ke netaa parminder singh dhindsa ne kaha, 'punjab kii mukhya vipakshi party aam aadmi party ne kaha ki estf to abhi sirf ek elaan he
 First the government should take a big action against drugs, then we will see what is the intention of the government, and how serious the government is after the elimination of drugs
 'purv dijipi punjab ke shashikant ne kaha, 'STF kaa gathan karke captain amarinder singh ne chunaav purv kiya apana vaayada to puraa kar diya he lekin STF punjab main faili nashe kii jadon ko kab tak khatm kar paaegi ye to aane vaala vakt hi batayega
 ' lok janashakti party ke saansad chiraag paswan ne anusuchit jati or janajati ke mudde par pradhanmantri narendra modi ko khat likhaa he, jisase centre sarkaar kii mushkilen bad gai hai
 Chirag Paswan wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that on March 20, Supreme Court Judge AK Goyal ruled on the SC / ST (prevention of Atrocities) Act
 isse anusuchit jati or janajati samudaay main asantosh or aakrosh hai
 Chirag Paswan said that against the Supreme Court's decision, the scheduled castes and tribes had staged a fierce protest during the agitation on February 2, which caused a lot of loss of life and property and against our NDA government in the Scheduled Castes and Tribes There was an atmosphere of mistrust without reason
 ek baar phir se anusuchit jati or janajati varg ne nau agast ko bharat band kaa aahvaan kiya he
 Demonstrations are expected to be more fierce this time, due to which we need to take appropriate steps
 chiraag paswan ne kaha ki supreme court ke jis jaj eke goyal ne SC / ST (atyaachaar nivaaran) adhinium par faisla sunaaya tha, unhen ritairement ke baad neshnal green tribunel kaa chayarmen banaaya gaya he
 The government's decision sent a message to the Scheduled Castes and Tribals that the government has awarded Justice AK Goel to pronounce judgment against SC / ST
 chiraag paswan ne piem modi ke saamne rakhi ye maangencirag paswan ne piem modi ko likhe khat main kaha ki nau agast ko phir se hinsa na ho, iske liye aap ye kadam uthaaen
 
 
 
 1 - eke goyal ko neshnal green tribunel ke chairman pad se sarkaar turant barkhaast kare
 2 - In this monsoon session of Parliament, an amended bill should be brought against the Supreme Court's decision on SC / ST (prevention of Atrocities) Act, in which the protection of scheduled castes and tribes can be restored
 agar isamen kisi bhi tarah kii aadchan aati he, to sansad ke satr ko 10 agast kii jagah aath agast ko samaapt kar is par adhyadesh laayaa jaae
 This will create an atmosphere of trust between the Scheduled and Scheduled Tribes towards the government
 saath hi 20 march se pehle kii sthiti behaal ho sakegi or nau agast ko bharat band se hone vaale nuksaan ko roka ja sakegaa
 Modi government is stuck in mid-day due to Chirag Paswan's letter before the election
 is masale ko lekar pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kii chintaa bad gai he
 The reason for this is that any move by the Modi government on this issue is not right, because the matter is still under consideration in the Supreme Court
 iske alaava eke goyal ko neshnal green tribunel ke chairman pad se hataane kii maang ko bhi maananaa modi sarkaar ke liye aasaan nahin he
 If the government does this, then the message will go that the government has taken such a decision under pressure from its constituents
 adhyadesh laane par vichaar kar rahi modi sarkarsutron kii maane to maamle ko badhata dekh modi sarkaar sansad ke monsoon satr ke baad SC / ST (atyaachaar nivaaran) adhinium par adhyadesh laane par vichaar kar rahi he
 The problem of the government is that on the one hand, the Opposition is not leaving any chance to surround the government, on the other hand its partners from time to time also raise such issues and keep the government in the dock
 sutron ke mutabik anusuchit jati or janajati varg ke vibhinn sanghathanon or samoohon ke netao ke saath modi sarkaar ke varisht mantri baatcheet karenge
 They can appeal against the government's next steps on SC / ST (prevention of Atrocities) Act and not to stop India on August 9

 The Triple Talaq Bill was finally passed in the Lok Sabha after heavy opposition
 is dauraan bill ke paksh main 303 vot, jabaki 82 logon ne virodh main vot daale
 JDU, TRS, YSR Congress and TMC walked out of Parliament before voting
 jediu, tiemasi vot se alag raheen, vahiin bijedy ne bill ke paksh main vot kiya
 Explain that Law and Justice Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad introduced in the Lok Sabha to discuss and pass the 'muslim Women (protection of Marriage Rights) Bill 2019', in which the protection of the rights of married Muslim women and breaking the marriage by their husbands by saying divorce thrice
 Provision has been made to prohibit
 ravishankar prasad ne charchaa ke dauraan kaha ki teen talaak par roak lagane sambandhi vidheyak siyasat, dharm, sampradaay kaa prashn nahin he balki yah 'nari ke sammaan or nari-nyaay' kaa sawaal he or hindustan kii betiyon ke adhikaron kii suraksha sambandhi is pahal kaa sabhi ko samarthan karnaa chahie
 The Law and Justice Minister said that gender justice is at the core of the constitution and discrimination against women and children is prohibited in any way
 modi sarkaar ke mul main bhi langik nyaay he
 Our schemes like 'beti Bachao, Beti Padhao', 'ujjwala' are related to empowering women
 isi disha main peedit mahilaon kii suraksha ke liye ham kanoon banane kii pahal kar rahe hai
 He said that the apex court had ruled that some women, who were victims of triple talaq, approached the Supreme Court
 yah 5 nyaayamurtiyon kii peeth thi
 The gist of the judgment was that the apex court ruled the practice to be wrong
 is bare main kanoon banane kii baat kahi gai
 Prasad said, "so if the women do not move in this direction, then do the oppressed women hang the decision in the house
 '' prasad ne kaha ki yah ''nari ke sammaan or nari-nyaay kaa sawaal he, dharm kaa nahin
 The Congress demanded that the Bill prohibiting triple talaq be referred to the Standing Committee, saying that it is not proper to make triple talaq a criminal case
 loksabhaa main 'muslim mahila (vivaah adhikaar sangrakshan) vidheyak 2019' par charchaa main bhaag lete hue congress saansad gaurav gogoi ne kaha ki bhaajapa kii taraf se yah bhranti failaai ja rahi he ki hamaari party kaa rukh spasht nahin he
 We want to make it clear that our stand is clear
 teen talaak ke khilaaf ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisle kaa sabase pehle congress ne swaagat kiya tha
 He said that the Congress was opposed to just three divorces making it a criminal case, whereas it is a civil matter
 gogoi ne is vidheyak ko sthaayee samiti ke paas bhejne kii maang kii
 He said that their husbands have left millions of Hindu women, why are they not being worried? Earlier, Congress MP Mohammad Javed also opposed the bill and said that it should be referred to the Standing Committee of Parliament and a law should be made for women of all religions forced to abstain from husbands
 unhone is vidheyak ko samvidhan ke anuchhed 14 ke khilaaf qaraar dete hue daawa kiya ki yah vidheyak musalamaanon kii barbaadi ke liye laayaa gaya he
 Javed asked who will give alimony to the victim when the Muslim man is in jail? The JDU MP said that his party has been in the NDA since 1996 and is still in the coalition
 jadyu bich main kuch saal gathbandhan se alag rahi
 He said that right from the beginning, our party was clear that it would not support the BJP on controversial issues
 singh ne kaha ki hamaari party kaa mat he ki kashmir par anuchhed 370 se chhedchhad nahin honi chahie, ayodhya maamle kaa samaadhaan adaalat main yaa aapasi sahmati se hona chahie or samaan naagarik samhita se koi chhedchhad nahin honi chahie
 He said that similarly our party is not with the government on the issue of triple talaq
 ab tak dengue kaa kahar jhel rahi dilli ke liye chikangunia ek nayaa villen banakar saamne aayaa he
 The chikungunya which the doctors have till now described as less dangerous than dengue, the same chikungunya has now suddenly taken the form of a deadly disease
 sar ganga ram aspataal se jab chikangunia se pehali maut kii khabar ai to janata ke saath-saath doctor bhi hairaan the
 It was difficult to understand how this disease caused by mosquitoes suddenly became so dangerous
 doctoron kaa maananaa- chikangunia jaanaleva nahinisse pehle ki doctor or swasthya vibhaag halaat kaa thik-thik andaja laga pate, chikangunia ne ek ke baad ek marijon ko shikaar bananaa shuru kar diya
 By Tuesday evening, the figure of chikungunya deaths in the country's capital reached five
 inamen se chaar mautein to sirf sar ganga ram aspataal main hui thim
 In addition to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, a patient in Hindu Rao Hospital succumbed to Chikungunya
 haalanki doctoron kaa maananaa he ki chikangunia akele itnaa khatarnaak nahin hota
 But if the patient already has diabetes, asthma or heart disease, then chikungunya can become life-threatening for such patients
 ames ke doctor bhi maan rahe hai ki ye mahamari he
 But the Health Minister of Delhi is not ready to believe that Chikungunya is also a disease
 doctor se zyada mantri mahoday ko power he to vah kuch bhi bol sakate he
 It is a different matter that Satyendra Jain, who became the Health Minister after studying the artifact, has started to consider himself a doctor
 lekin sawalmantri ke badbolepanka nahin he, sawaal chikangunia se hui in paanch mauton kaa he
 Increased cases everywhere, the question may arise in every mind that if the first death occurred on 1 September, then there would have been more deaths in this last 12 days, which have not been confirmed yet, because on one hand the MCD figures are saying that in Delhi So far 1724 cases of chikungunya have been reported, whereas the truth is that in the country's largest hospital AIIMS, 60% of the total cases of chikungunya are present
 ames main chikangunia ke 1360 maamle hai, jabaki apollo main 775, safadarajang main 531, aaramail main 375, biel kapur main 145, bada hindu raav main 82 or gangaaraam main 65 maamle hai
 Hundreds of claim cases have been issued from hundreds of positive cases of Chikungunya in all hospitals including Apollo Hospital of Safdarjung to Safdarjung RML
 aankado ke lihaaj se samajhe to 3300 se zyada maamle rajdhani ke sirf saat bade aspataalon main saamne aae hai
 The total number of hospitals, big and small, is much higher
 lekin vidambnaa dekhie ki na mauton kaa koi jimmedaar he or na failte rog kii jimmedaari kisi par he
 The game of accusations continues, and no one avoids making aerial claims
 britain kii rajdhani landan main aaj mahatma gandhi se judi chizon kii nilaamee kii jaaegi, jisamen baapu ke khun kaa khatra, shawl, sandals or chaaval kaa katoraa shaamil he
 Auctions to be held in Shropshire, UK, will bid for Gandhi's blood piece today and are expected to fetch between 10,000 pounds to 15,000 pounds (US $ 15,200 to 22,800 US dollars)
 nilaamee main rakhaa jane vaala khun kaa kataraa mahatma gandhi ke sharir se 1924 main liya gaya tha
 At that time, he underwent appendix surgery in a hospital in Mumbai and at the same time this blood was removed from his body for examination
 mahatma gandhi ke khun ke katare ke alaava unki sandals, shawl, or chaaval kaa katoraa tathaa chammach kii bhi nilaamee kii jaaegi
 On the other hand, this auction is also being criticized

 In that auction, Indian industrialist Vijay Mallya bought five items related to Bapu, including his glasses, watch, slippers, thali and bowl for US $ 1

 The whole country saw how the path of Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal parted
 par kai rahasyon se abhi tak pardaa puri tarah nahin uthaa he
 One of the reasons for the separation between them may be a minor mistake of the PMO during the upa's tenure
 anna ne di modi ko dhamkiek angreji akhbaar kii report ke mutabik, upie sarkaar main tab ke videsh mantri salmaan khurshid ne anna hajaare ke saath pune main ek gupt baithak kii thi
 After this meeting, the PMO sent a letter to Anna, which was mistakenly delivered to Arvind Kejriwal's house
 haalanki anna ne khud hi apane patrachaar ke pataa ke taur par kejariwal ke ghar kaa pataa diya tha
 But then the PMO was not aware that such a confidential letter should be sent directly to Anna Hazare's village address
 jab arvind kejariwal ko khurshid ke is 'mishan' kii jaankaree mili, to ve satark ho gaye
 He then accused the Manmohan Singh government of trying to create a rift between him and Anna Hazare
 darasal, chitthee se jaahir ho rahaa tha ki khurshid ne anna hajaare ko saal 2014 ke aam chunaav main congress ke paksh main prachaar karne ke liye manaa liya tha
 Anna was thanked for this in the letter
 par kejariwal ke ghar chitthee pahunchane se sara maamla bighad gaya
 As far as Salman Khurshid is concerned, when he came to know about this mistake, he was shocked
 iske baavjood unhone is baat se inkaar kiya ki unhone anna ke saath kisi tarah kii gupt meeting kii he
 According to the report, Anna himself had suggested to Khurshid that if such information is leaked in the media, then he should turn away from the meeting and tell lies in the country
 anna ke saath pune main us dauraan kiran bedi bhi thim
 Anna also hid information from him
 unhone kiran bedi se kaha tha ki ve ek sant se milane ja rahe hai, jo unase akele hi milanaa chaahate hai
 At the meeting, Khurshid presented the government's side in front of Anna
 unhone anna ko kejariwal kii raajnneetik mahatvakanksha ke bare main aagaah kiya
 Anna was satisfied with the government ombudsman bill, when Kejriwal called it 'jokpal'

 sattarudh congress sarkaar is kadam ko apane chunavi prachaar abhiyaan main bhrashtachar khatm karne ke vaade ko puraa karne kaa prayaas bataa rahi he, lekin bhaajapa ise vipaksh par jabardastee dabaav banane kii sajeesh bataa rahi he
 On July 27, the state's Economic Crime Branch (EOW) arrested two people
 ek, nirmal avasthi jo purv mantri ke nivas par bataur telephone oparator niyukt the or duusare, unke oesady virendra pandey
 Both are accused of conspiring to fix the e-tender of the Water Resources Department (WRD) and colluding with the engineers of the department and a private company that oversees the online service portal
 avasthi or pandey philhal nyaayik hiraasat main hai
 Sources say that the role of these two persons of Mishra's personal staff was in the process of deciding the tender
 may main giraftaar kiye gaye ek anya bicheliye manish khare ne saaf taur par unke naam kaa ullekh karte hue is sambandh main unki bhoomika kii ore ishaara kiya tha
 Khare and the two employees are accused of tendering Rs 116 crore to a Gujarat firm
 haalanki, purv mantri mishra kaa aarope he ki ghotaale main unka naam jodgaye ke liye un donon par dabaav daalaa ja rahaa he
 He says, "senior officials are involved in the process of awarding e-tender
" 
 
 isamen class 3 or 4 str ke karmchaaree herpher nahin kar sakate
 Awasthi and Pandey's wives have also filed an application in the High Court that their husbands have been caught for using them to implicate Minister Mishra
 unka aarope he ki karnataka main congress-jad (es) kii sarkaar girane ke baad, sattarudh party ashankit he ki kahin madhya pradesh main bhi kursi na chhin jaae, isliye vipakshi netaaon par dabaav banaakar pareshaan kiya ja rahaa he
 It is true that after the Lok Sabha elections, investigations into the alleged scams of the previous regime have gained momentum
 (chunaavon ke dauraan iskaa najaara mukhyamantri kamalnath ke sahyogiyon or rishtedaaron ke nivaason par ity chaape main saaf dekha gaya)
 But in the political corridor of Bhopal, there is no surprise that Mishra is in charge
 mishra raajnneeti kii jodtod main maahir hai or congress ke vidhayak choudhary rakesh singh or sanjay pathak ko bhaajapa main laane kaa shrey unheen ko jaataa he
 He has also been vocal about bringing some Congress mlas into his side to topple the Kamal Nath government
 unhen bhaajapa adhyaksh or kendriya grih mantri amit shah kaa kareebi bhi mana jaataa he
 The Union Home Ministry has enhanced the security of Mishra by giving him a Y-class security, which mlas do not normally get
 yani un par aanch badhaakar kamalnath siyaasi makasad saadh rahe hai
 Awasthi used to work in a private position with Mishra earlier, but he got a peon job in the Law Department a year ago
 mishra kanoon vibhaag ke bhi mantri the
 On the other hand, Virender Pandey has been with Mishra for many years and is a third class employee in the water resources department
 avasthi or pandey abhi aarthik aparaadh shakha kii hiraasat main hai
 If they open their tongue, it can be difficult for Mishra
 agency 2008 ke ek puraane maamle kii bhi jaanch kar rahi he jisamen iskar vibhaag ko mishra or sandehaaspad kaarobaari mukesh sharma ke bich taar dikhaai die the
 Mishra was then Urban Administration Minister and documents found at Sharma's house show that a Hyderabad-based company owed money to Mishra
 purv mantri kaa daawa he ki unhen us maamle main ity vibhaag ne bari kar diya tha
 However, the Economic Offenses Branch is a separate agency
 is bich, rajya ke sutron kaa kahana he ki vyapam or indore ke pension ghotaalon kii jaanch phir se shuru hone kii sambhaavna he, jisamen kathith taur par bhaajapa mahasachiv kailash vijayawargeey shaamil the

 raksha mantri ne rajyasabha main kaha ki sena ke andar shikayaton ko lekar ek prakriya bani hui he or har jawan ko iskaa paalan karnaa chahie
 Significantly, first BSF jawan Tej Bahadur and then army jawan Yagya Pratap put their complaint on social media
 tej bahadur ne jahaan apane yahaan khaane kii kharaab quality kii baat kii to vahiin yajna pratap ne sena ke adhikariyon par javaanon kaa shoshan karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 The comments parrikar ne kaha ki soshal media main samasya post karne se samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin hoga
 If there is such a thing in a platoon, the jawans should first tell the commanding officer, ie CO
 agar yahaan bhi jawan kii baat nahin suni jaati he to sidhe sena pramukh ko apni baat kah sakate hai, yaa to chitthee ke jariye yaa phir whatsap number ke jariye
 And if the grievance is not resolved even at the level of the Chief of Army Staff, the jawans can also speak to the Defense Minister
 raksha mantri ke mutabik javaanon se mili feed back ke aadhaar par khaane kii quality main sudhaar hua he
 For example, earlier the army used to buy chicken locally but now can also buy frozen chicken
 itnaa hi nahin ab javaanon ko rojaanaa do andey khaane ko die jate hai jabaki pehle ek anda diya jaataa tha
 According to the Defense Minister, further improvements will be made based on the feedback and information
 gauratlab he ki pehle biguef ke jawan tej bahadur or phir sena ke jawan yajna pratap ne apni shikaayat soshal media main rakhi
 While Tej Bahadur talked about the poor quality of his food, Yagya Pratap accused the army officers of exploiting the soldiers
 tippaniyan Parrikar said that posting the problem on social media will not solve the problem
 agar kisi palaton main aisi koi baat hoti he to jawan pehle commanding adhikari yani sio se kahen
 If the jawan is not heard here, then you can say your thing directly to the army chief, either through a letter or through a whatsapp number
 or agar sena pramukh ke str par bhi shikaayat kaa nipataara nahin hota he to jawan raksha mantri ke paas bhi apni baat kah sakate hai
 According to the Defense Minister, the food quality has improved based on the feed back received from the soldiers

 Not only this, now the jawans are given two eggs daily to eat, whereas earlier one egg was given

 Yeddyurappa was born on 27 February 1943 at Bukhanakere in Mandya district of the state to Siddalingappa and Putthayamma
 is tarah se yediurppa ne 75 saal kii umr puri kar lee he
 The 75-year-old deadline in Modi's government may have announced not to contest the next election, but it is natural for him to be pressurized after Siddaramaiah's decision
 itnaa hi nahin piem narendra modi ne 2014 main hi elaan kar diya tha ki bijepi main jis netaa kii umr 75 saal ke upar hogi
 He will not be given any position in the government
 isi ke chalate modi cabinet se najma hepatulla or calraj mishra kii chuttee hui thi
 Yeddyurappa has completed 75 years of age, Yeddyurappa has completed 75 years of age
 iske baavjood party ne unhen karnataka main mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya he
 In fact, at present the BJP has no other leader of the stature of Yeddyurappa in Karnataka
 iske alaava jaateey sameekaran ke lihaaj se bhi yediurppa bijepi ke liye feet baithte hai
 In view of all this, the party has made him the face
 lekin agle vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan yediurppa kii umr 80 saal kii hogi
 In view of this, it is believed that this time will be his last election

 punjab main faridakot riyasat ke divangat shaasha maharaja harinder singh baraar kii sabase badi putree, 80 varshiya amrit cor chandigarh ke sector 11 main apane saadagi bhare drawing room main baithi hai
 He is not convinced that he will get Rs 20,000 crore
 kii sampatti kaa sah-uttaradhikari ghoshit kiya gaya he
 On 25 July, the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate Rajnish Kumar Sharma concluded that the Maharaja's will was bogus, ending the two decades of fighting
 maharaja kii maut 1989 main ho gai thi
 The court said that his property should be inherited by his two surviving heirs Amrit Kaur and 77-year-old Deepinder Kaur
 sampatti kaa prabandh meharwaal khevaji trust ke haathon main tha
 Deepinder was married in West Bengal to Saday Chand Mehtab of a famous zamindar family of Burdwan
 is sampatti main punjab kaa ek mahal, ek kila or ek hawaii adda, haryana main manimajaraa fort, ek hawaii pattee or kheti kii jameen, himachal pradesh ke mashobra main jameen, dilli ke copernicus maarg par faridakot house or hyderabad main do flats shaamil hai
 The Maharaja also had a collection of vintage cars, bank balances and jewelery
 shuruaati anumaanon ke hisaab se is sampatti kii kul keemat kareeb 20,000 karod ru
 is
 vasiyat ko adaatal main chunauti dene vaali amrit cor ke paksh main faisla sunaate hue mukhya nyaayik magistrate sharma ne kaha ki vasiyat farji thi taaki maharaja kii sampatti trust ke haath main aa jaae
 The trust was managed by one of his three daughters (deepinder Kaur), his servants and lawyers
 yah trust 1986 main banaaya gaya tha
 This will, prepared in 1982, came to light after the Maharaja's demise in 1989
 amrit cor kahati hai ki adaalat ke faisle se unhen bahut ‘‘shahat’’ mili he
 She says, "my father went into deep depression after the death of my brother Tikka Harmohinder Singh Brar in a road accident in 1981
 unki kharaab tabiyat kaa phayda uthaate hue unke sevakon ne kuch vakeelon kii mileebhagat se ek farji vasiyat banavaa lee or ek trust banaakar uske sadsy ban gaye
 According to a fake will, two daughters Dipinder and Mahipinder respectively received Rs 1,200
 or 1,000 ru
 Monthly salary of Rs
 maharaja kii sabase badi beti amrit cor, patni narinder cor yaa unki maa mohinder cor ko kuch bhi nahin diya gaya
 Both Maharaja's mother and wife were alive at that time
 maharaja kii teesri beti mahipinder cor kaa 2001 main shimla ke mashobra main nidhan ho gaya
 Amrit Kaur approached the court in 1992 and has been fighting a court battle ever since
 ve kahati hai, ‘‘mere pita ke saath dhokhebaaji kii gai
 Therefore it was necessary to fight the case
 sirf paise kii baat nahin he
 It was necessary to bring this fraud to the fore
 ’’ mukademe ke dauraan ek baar trust ke vakil ne adaalat ko bataaya tha ki maharaja apni beti amrit cor se bahut naaraaz the kyonki unhone pita kii marji ke khilaaf shaadi kii thi, isliye unhen koi sampatti nahin di gai
 Amrit Kaur dismisses it outright, saying, "my father never made a will
" main unki mrityu tak unke saath thi
 i also have a letter written to him, in which he told my husband Harpal Singh (now 90 years old and retired as the DG of Vigilance Department in Haryana State Electricity Board) that for marriage he would Send the guest list to them
 ’’amrit cor kii ore se pairvi karne vaale chandigarh sthit vakil manjit singh khera kehete hai, ‘‘itani badi dhokhadhadi kabhi-kabhaar hi dekhne ko milti he
 Can you imagine that they (trustees) did not even make a list of property and goods
 ve daawa karte hai ki maharaja ke nidhan ke baad mashobra main unki tijori main vasiyat ke alaava kuch bhi nahin tha
 What kind of trust is this, in which there is neither a beneficiary nor any provision of service? He says, the Maharaja wanted the rest of the property to be kept for commercial use, except for three properties
 ham is par bilkul yakeen nahin karte hai
 Lalit Gupta, executive member of the trust, said that when he did not read the court order properly, he could not comment
 lekin pehle kii ek media report main unhen yah kehete hue bataaya gaya ki ve is faisle ke khilaaf apil karenge
 Jaichand Mehtab, the trust's vice president and son of Deepinder Kaur, declined to speak anything when contacted by phone at his home in Kolkata
 historical accounts of faridakot state kaa doosraa sanskaran janvari main aayaa he or jise trust ne pryojit kiya he
 Its author Amarjeet Dhillon wrote in an email sent to India Today from his home in Ontario, Canada, "it seems a suitable case for appeal
" jahaan tak meri jaankaree he, vasiyat main kisi tarah kii dhokhadhadi nahin kii gai thi
 The Maharaja was alive for 7 years after this will
 agar yah farji hoti to ve ise badal sakate the
 "amrit Kaur says," i am ready to fight till the end
 jab se maine mukadmaa darj kiya, mujhe apane pita kii kisi bhi sampatti main pair rakhane kii ijaajat nahin thi
 Not even in the palace where i was born and brought up
 ’’ jab unase poocha gaya ki ve is daulat kaa kya karengi, to ve kuch der chup rahane ke baad boleen, ‘‘maine abhi is bare main nahin sochaa he
 All i know is that it will be spent properly
 ’’ unki sabase choti beti 51 varshiya gurveen ech
 Singh is working with Khaira in the case after quitting her job last year
 ve kahati hai, ‘‘mere sabase bade bhai 58 varshiya jaskaran singh landan main bas gaye, isliye maine manjit ko puri jaankaree dene main sahyog kiya
 It was necessary for the three of us to tell the world, including 57-year-old Simar Negi, who served as the Chief Commissioner of Income Tax in Delhi
 ’’faridakot kii shahi sampatti kii kismat kaa faisla hone main ho saktaa he, abhi kuch or saal lagen
 a lot will depend on whether the two sisters would like to meet each other in the meantime
