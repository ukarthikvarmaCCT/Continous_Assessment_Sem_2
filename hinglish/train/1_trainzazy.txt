 There are many places in India where earthquakes keep happening
 world bank or united nesan kii report ke ek anumaan ke mutabik 2050 tak bharat ke kareeb lakhon log bukamp or tufaan ke kaaran beghar honge
 In seismic zoning mapping India is divided into 4 levels, in a way we can say that India is divided into 4 seismic zones
 jone-2, jone-3, jone-4, jone-5
 Zone-5 is the area where earthquake is most likely
 vahiin jone-2 aisa kshetra he jahaan bukamp aane kii ashanka sabase kam hoti he
 Based on this, let us look at such cities in India where the possibility of earthquake is the highest
 jone-5:jone-5 aisa kshetra hota he jahaan sabase zyada bukamp kaa khatra hota he
 It includes the center of the Himalayas, runs of Kashmir and Kutch
 jone-4:is jone ko sabase zyada nuksaan vaala ilaaka kaha jaataa he
 This zone includes areas in Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir and Maharashtra
 jone-3:is jone ko modrat damege risk jone kehete hai is jone main andaman nicobar, bestern himalay ke bhaag shaamil hai
 Zone-2: Low Damage Risk Zone
 1
 Guwahati (assam) Guwahati (assam) falls in the seismic zone of Zone-5
 yah aisa kshetra he jahaan bukamp aane kii ashanka sabase zyada he
 Even before this, earthquakes have occurred many times here
 guwahati main kai baar bukamp kii bhavishyavaanee hoti rahati he
 This is the reason that even parts of north-east are affected by it
 2
 Srinagar (jammu and Kashmir) Many cities in the state of Jammu and Kashmir fall under Seismic Zone-5
 kashmir ghati ke kai ilaake jaise baramullah, kupwara, bandipura cesmik jone-5 ke andar aate hai
 50% of the state's population lives in these areas
 baaki kaa ladakh or jammu kaa kshetra sesasmik jone-4 ke andar aata he jahaan par bhi bukamp kii ashanka sabase zyada hoti he
 Talking about Srinagar, this area is very close to the Himalayas, so there is always an earthquake risk here

 Delhi: Delhi falls in Zone-4
 1720 ke baad se dilli 5 megnitude ke kareeb 5 bukampon ko sah chuki he
 Areas near Yamuna in Delhi are the most prone to earthquakes

 america or bharat ke rishte hameshaa utaar-chadhaav se bhare rahe hai
 Sometimes America becomes closer to India, sometimes it is far away
 yah sabhi jaanate hai ki bharat ne aazaadee ke baad gut nirpeksh andolan ko badhaayaa jo america ko kabhi pasand nahin aayaa
 He wanted India to join his group, but India held on to the Soviet Union, which remained until its dissolution in 1991
 uske baad hi bharat ne america-europe kii ore haath badhaayaa
 It was not that the two had a strong relationship
 raashtrapati jon epa kennedy ke samay main to donon deshon main bahut hi achche sambandh the
 But in later years she did not remain sweet
 kaaran tha ki america kaa jhukaav hameshaa se pakistan kii ore rahaa or baad main china se bhi uske sambandhon main sudhaar hua
 But after 9 / 11, America's thinking changed and things started changing
 bharat-america ek duusare ke kareeb aate gaye
 Many important agreements were also reached between the two
 lekin mitrataa ke is raah main gadde bhi bahut milte rahe
 There is also a lobby in the US which continues to cause problems for India
 uskaa bada udhaaharan america ech-1bi (asthaayee) vija main kai tarah ke pratibandh ke rup main dikhaa
 It was not that it affected the relationship of both but there was some disappointment
 america raashtrapati baraak obama ne bharat kaa daura bhi kiya or sambandhon ko majboot karne kii koshish bhi kii lekin taliban or pakistan ke prati unke drushtikon se bharat sahamat nahin rahaa
 Apart from this, the relationship between the two remained bitter
 obama nahin chaahate ki america se bharat outsorcing ho
 They believed that this was reducing employment opportunities in America
 lekin iske baavjood vyapaarik morche par donon kii nikatataa badhati gai or aaj donon deshon ke bich kareeb 63 arab dollar kaa salanaa vyapaar he
 But after the Devyani Khobragade scandal, there was a rift in their relationship
 yah aisi ghatana thi ki jisase bhartiya janata main america ke prati rosh bhar gaya
 The matter is currently resolved in a provisional manner, but the conspiracy remains intact
 america sarkaar ko iskaa ahsaas he
 But more than that, America is feeling that there will be a change of power in India and Narendra Modi can become the Prime Minister
 aise main use bharat ke prati apni nitiyon main badlaav kii jarurat mahasoos ho rahi he
 America is a shrewd player of diplomacy and has a sense of urgency
 vah jaanata he ki asia main china ke badhate prabhutv ko rokane main use koi madad kar saktaa he to vah he bharat
 China has begun to improve its relations with Pakistan and is currently working on projects worth thousands of crores of dollars there
 aarthik diwaaliyepan ke kagaar par khadey pakistan ko china ne puri tarah se apane pash main baandh rahaa he
 In such a situation, America sees an important partner in India
 vah isaki upeksha nahin kar saktaa
 India is not only its big business partner but also a big partner in the military sector
 america ko is samay bharat kii jarurat he
 Keeping the new government happy earlier is a part of the same strategy

 bollywood actress deepika padukon ko kitna gussa aa saktaa he iskaa andaja 14 sitambar kii unki twits ko padhakar lag gaya tha
 He gave such a reply to twitter 'khabar' of a reputed English newspaper that the readers were stunned
 ab deepika ne fasebuk par ek post daali he jise padhakar unke prati sammaan or bad jayega
 In this post titled 'my Point of View', Deepika wrote - 'the only indication that a woman is willing to have a physical relationship is when she says' yes'
 sabko pataa he ki desh main ek tay samaaj kii soch badalane ke liye ham kitne joardaar tareeke se koshish kar rahe hai or iske sahare kaise ham ek aisi khushhaal duniya kii taraf badhane kii koshish kar rahe hai jisamen asamanta, rape, dar or dard jaisi chijen na hon
 i know very well about my work, my work is very demanding which wants me to do a lot
 kisi role kii maang ho sakati he ki main sir se pair tak cover rahun yaa puri tarah nagn ho jaaun or tab ek actor ke taur par yah meraa nirnay hoga ki main yah karnaa chaahati hum yaa nahin
 This difference has to be understood that there is a difference between role and real and my job is to play the role given to me well
 padhein: deepika ne poocha, 'main mahila hum, mere breast hai, aapako problem?'jo mujhe lagata he wo main safataur par likh rahi hum jisase ise shahrukh ke atpacks or kisi mahila ke sharir kii banaavat ke saath uljhaayaa naa jaae
 i have raised my voice against an ideology that is pushing us back and which is being used to grab the attention of the people at a time when we are fighting for equality for women
 ek aise vakt main jab mahilaayein purushon ke varchasv vaale samaaj main jagah bana rahi hai or jiske liye unki tarif kii jaani chahie, ham asal jindagi or cinema ke bich kii rekha ko mitaa rahe hai or ek saal puraani baat ko khabar kii tarah pesh karke apni sari koshishen kharaab kar rahe hai
 Taking out an old news and giving her headline 'OMG: Deepika Cleavage Show' is a misuse of power by promoting backward thinking
 agar kisi actress ke kapade idhar-udhar ho jaaen, to aisa nahin maan liya janaa chahie ki usne jaanboojh kar aisa kiya hoga
 In such a situation, it would be better to zoom the camera and circle the particular part and draw an arrow to get special attention to it, that we give some respect to that actress and let such things go and not make headlines on them
 
 kya ham insaan nahin hai? haa, aisa he ki filmon main ham hero ke atpac abs ko dekhakar khush hote hai, jalte hai lekin jab wo hero public main aata he to kya ham uske croch (dono jaanghon ke bich kaa hissaa) par camera juum karke aisi hi sasti hedline banaate hai?'main kabhi bhi kisi role ko nibhaane se bhaagi nahin hum or naa hi mujhe apane sharir ko lekar banaai gai khabaron se koi dikkat he
 i am playing the role of a dancer once in my upcoming film
 (ye baat saarvajanik karne ke liye farah khan se maafee maangati hum
 ) It is not a matter of making news on the breast or any other part of the body
 mudda ye he ki khabar kis sandarbh main banaai ja rahi he yaa khabar ko bechney ke liye uskaa sandarbh kitna badla ja rahaa he
 That too at a time when there is a great need for change in thinking about women
 mere liye yah baat yaheen khatm ho jaati he
 Everyone has the right to express their views
 mujhe lagata he agar isko or lanbaa khinchaa to is mudde ko gairajaruri tavajjo mil jayega
 It can be twisted and twisted, which can lead to further vomiting
 Live well, laugh often and love much

 isse pehle kii aisi hi ek ghatana ke tahat kerala main ek bank kii shakha main dakaiton ne building ke ek floor ko khodakar strong room main pahunchane kaa rasta banaaya tha or vahaan se 80 kilo sona sahit kareeb aath karod kii rakam kii chori kar lee thi
 The dacoits were later arrested and their leader confessed that he had adopted the idea of theft by watching a Hindi film
 loktantr khatre main he, hamen chahie aazaadee, sampradayik takatein, dharmanirpekshata, bolne kaa adhikaar, phacist, mahilaon ke haq, or na jane kya-kya? bas kuch yahi shabd hai jo chhaune budhimaanon ke gang main khaase prachlit hai
 Rite these few words and give them political knowledge
 na badi-badi theory padhane kaa jhanjhat or na unke arth samajhane kii chik-chik
 Yes, without working on the getup you will not be able to join this group
 jaise shuddh sooti sari lekin brands antarrashtriya hona chahie
 Only jewelery should be antique
 purush hai to rangeen kurta or badi dadhi, par basalike andaaj main nahin
 For the criticisms of government schemes, by emphasizing the forehead like an expert, he has to say, the government has become a dictator
 amuk netaa kaa ravaiya phacist he
 Dictatorship will not work
 loktantr khatre main he
 Et cetera et cetera
 or phir dekhie asar!jaruri taur par aapke chehre par ek khaas kism kii gambhirtha tari rahani chahie
 Whatever the issue may be, make sugar syrup of these words and then throw the rasgulla of the spirit and throw it on the front
 par har maamle ke jaankaar or aalochana karne main maahir ye log kya vaaki mudde kii gaharaai main utarate hai? yel psychologist leonid rojenblit or frank kil ne shrinkhalabaddh kai prayog kiye
 After this, both of them named this attitude of the group of these wise intellectuals eager to speak on every issue as "illusion of Explanatory Depth"
 matlab aise vyakti ko sambandhit mudde par gahari jaankaree hone kaa bhram hota he
 Well, God forgive them because the person involved in this group of so-called wise people does not know that there is a limit to understanding and thinking
 ab khatra yah he ki is tarah kii baaten chaharadivari ke bheetar hon to kaha-suni tak simit rahati hai
 But as Pash had said, the most dangerous is the death of dreams
 lekin aaj agar pash hote to kehete, bhai isse bhi khatarna hota he, aisi adhjal gagari kaa chaay ke addon, uniwarsities kii canteenon or media daftaron ke galiyaaron main chhalak janaa
 Journalists in particular get entangled in the hallucination that they become laughter characters
 or kabhi-kabhi to afvaahon ko failaanevaale jite-jaagate bhompu ban jate hai
 Victims of this hallucination are people standing in both the right and left corridors
 kuch aise hi logon kii maansikta par gahare shodh ke baad mashhoor sej publication main ''political extrimism ij saported bai en ilugen of anderstanding'' sheershak se ek shodh-patr prakashit hua
 During the experiment, people with extreme opinions on a plan were asked to explain it in a matter-of-fact manner with evidence, so people could not even tell the basic facts
 dobaaraa inhen logon se is yojana ke bare main apni raay dene ke liye kaha gaya to unhone pehle ke mukaable thodaa kam ativaadee ravaie ke saath is par raay rakhi
 The number of times this process was done, the less extreme it became
 kul milakar tathyon ke ulajhaau jangal main utarane ke baad unhen yah ehsaas hua ki bhai tathyon ko samajhnaa or khojna harek ke bas kii baat nahin
 Therefore, it is better to have a balanced opinion instead of an extreme attitude
 siyaasi dhruvikaran main is tarah kii bahason kaa bada yogadan he
 In fact, people associated with common and certain professions look intelligent and want to be a part of that group becomes a weapon of political players
 khari baat to he ki is tarah ke matibhram se bhari charchaaen hi to chunaav main jeet or haar kaa aadhaar banati hai
 The researchers said that the fear and extreme belief combined with the fear of being rejected by the group of intellectuals gives rise to extreme thinking
 is satahi aatmavishvaas or baat-vivaad main vinamrata kaa bhav rakhkar is ilugen yani matibhram se bachaa ja saktaa he
 So stop and think if we are a victim of this hallucination
 kyonki agar aaj pash hote to ve shaayad apni hi kavita kii line kuch yun badalte, khatarnaak hota he bhram kii buniyaad par tiki charampanthi siyaasi soch kaa dur-dur tak fail janaa
 And more dangerous than that, this thinking becomes a political weapon

 har salvishwakarmapuja kanya sankranti ko manaai jaati he
 Lord Vishwakarma was born on this day, hence it is also called Vishwakarma Jayanti
 is baar vishwakarma jayanti 17 sitambar 2018 ko somvaar yani aaj ke din manaai ja rahi he
 Actually, Vishwakarma is considered the world's first engineer and architect
 isliye is din udyogon, fektriyon or har tarah ke mashin kii puja kii jaati he
 This puja is performed by all artists, weavers, craftsmen and industrial houses
 lekin desh ke kuch bhaagon main ise deepawali ke duusare din bhi manaaya jaataa he
 Most of the factories are closed on this day and people worship Lord Vishwakarma with great enthusiasm
 uttar pradesh, bihar, pashchim bengal, karnataka, dilli aadi rajyon main bhagwaan vishwakarma kii bhavyamurtisthapit kii jaati he or unki aradhana kii jaati he
 What is the belief? It is said that in ancient times, all the capitals were there, almost all of them are said to be Vishwakarma
 yahaan tak ki satyuga kaa 'swarg lok', treta yug kii 'lanka', dwapar kii 'dwarika' or kalyug kaa 'hastinapur' aadi vishwakarma dwaara hi rachit hai
 It is also said about the immediate creation of 'sudamapuri' that its creator was Vishwakarma
 isse yah aashay lagaaya jaataa he ki dhan-dhaany or sukh-samruddhi kii abhilaashaa rakhane vaale purushon ko baba vishwakarma kii puja karnaa aavashyak or mangaladaayi he
 How the origin of Lord Vishwakarma - According to a story, in the beginning of the creation, the first 'narayana' i
e
 the personified Vishnu appeared on Shesharyya in Lord Sagar
 unke naabhi-camel se chartumukh brahma drushtigochar ho rahe the
 The sons of Brahma were 'dharma' and the sons of religion were 'vastudev'
 kaha jaataa he ki dharm kii 'vastu' naamak stri se utpann 'vaastu' saatven putr the, jo shilpashaastra ke aadi pravartak the
 Vishwakarma was born from his wife named 'angirasi' of the same Vastudeva
 pita kii bhaanti vishwakarma bhi vaastukala ke adwitiya acharya bane
 Various forms of Lord Vishwakarma - Many forms of Lord Vishwakarma are described - two-handed, four-armed and ten-armed
 iske alaava ek mukh, chaar mukh evam panchmukh vaale
 He has five sons named Manu, Maya, Tvashta, Shilpi and Daivagna
 yah bhi manyata he ki ye paanchon vaastu shilp kii alag-alag vidhaon main paarangat the or unhone kai vastuon kaa avishkaar kiya
 In this context, Manu is attached to iron, Maya is made of wood, skin is attached to bronze and copper, artisan brick and goddess are connected with gold and silver
 vishwakarma par prachlit katha bhagwaan vishwakarma kii mahatta sthapit karne vaali ek katha he
 According to this, a charioteer who lived in Varanasi with religious practices lived with his wife
 apane kaary main nipun tha, parantu vibhinn jagahon par gum-gum kar praytn karne par bhibhojnase adhik dhan nahin praapt kar paata tha
 Like a husband, the wife was also worried about not having a son
 putr prapti ke liye ve sadhu-santon ke yahaan jate the, lekin yah ichha uski puri na ho saki
 Then a neighboring Brahmin told the wife of Rathkar that you go to the shelter of Lord Vishwakarma, your wish will be fulfilled and listen to Lord Vishwakarma Mahatmya by fasting on Amavasya Tithi
 iske baad rathkaar evam uski patni ne amavasya ko bhagwaan vishwakarma kii puja kii, jisase use dhan-dhaany or putr ratna kii prapti hui or ve sukhi jivan vyateet karne lage
 This worship has great significance in North India
 jharkhand ke devgarh main somvaar ko bhagdad ke baad 11 shraddhaluon kii maut ho gai or 50 se kaanvdie ghayal ho gaye
 It is not new to have such a fatal stampede in temples, fairs and religious events in the country
 do saal pehle indian institute of management ne bheed ko niyantrit karne or aisi bhagadadon ko taalane ke upayon par ek study kii thi
 Know the five measures of the same study, which can be avoided by adopting such an anomaly
 1
 The VVIP entry-level administration feels that there may be security concerns with the arrival of VVIP at such a crowded place, so they should not hesitate to refuse the entry
 immergency eczit puri tarah se khule hone chahie
 There should not be barricading
 2
 Larger electrical items such as electrical generators, circuit breakers should be kept away from the crowded spaces as currents are spread due to current outages or short circuits
 aisi chizon ke aasapaas ek suraksha gheraa hona chahie
 It should also be ensured that no electrical wires are disconnected
 3
 At the time of planning, the travel safety agencies should carry out a thorough investigation about all the routes, surrounding areas and communication mediums reaching the planning site and make a complete plan based on that
 4
 Public Transport It is very important to keep in mind how much public transport services and parking are needed in view of congestion
 kisi bhi tarah kii immergency ko dhyaan main rakhkar puraa plan banaaya jaae
 The work of closing and fencing of the roads should be done in such a way that separate and adequate space can be provided to the pedestrians and vehicles
 5
 Health services It is very important to have complete preparation for medical and first aid for big religious events
 kisi bhi tarah kii imgency hone par ghayalon ko sahi vakt par ilaaj milane se zyaadaatar logon ko bachaaya ja saktaa he

 'bilawal, who is being projected as the future Prime Minister of Pakistan, said,' But surely under Bhuttoism the issue will be resolved according to the wishes of the Kashmiri people
 ’padhein: bilaval bhutto ke kashmir bayaan kaa jamkar uda majaakbhartiya media ne meraa dushprachaar kiya
 
 
 He said that his recent statement on Kashmir has triggered a sharp reaction in India
 bilaval ne kaha, ‘kyon, kyonki jab musharraf jaisaa taanashaah kashmir ke bare main bolta he to bharat kahata he ki iesai shaamil he, jab koi mullah bolta he to ve kehete hai ki aatankwaadi shaamil hai
 But when someone says Bhutto they know that it is the voice of the people
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘jab maine kashmir ke bare main bolaa to bharat baluchistan ke bare main bolaa
 The Indian media started propagating against me
 ’bilaval ne navaj sharif par saadhaa nishaanaa
 
 
 Bilawal also criticized the foreign policy of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League government
 unhone kaha, ‘hamaare paas aisa pradhanmantri he jo (bhartiya pradhanmantri narendra) modi ke shapathgrahan samaaroh main jane or shaamil hone ko utsuk rahata he
 This is our foreign policy
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘hamaare paas aisa pradhanmantri he jo sanyukt raashtra satr main gaya or sirf jo

 ’ varsh 2018 main aam chunaav ladane kii ghoshnaa kar chuke bilaval pipipi ke pramukh hai jo bharat ke saath aadhikarik str par achche sambandh chaahati he
 Musharraf's hand behind the murder of my mother, his mother late Benazir Bhutto became prime minister twice and his maternal grandfather Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, who founded the PPP in 1967, also became prime minister in the 1970s
 bilaval ne aarope lagaaya ki unki maa kii hatya ke peeche parvej musharraf or un logon kaa gupt agenda tha jo pakistan main loktantr nahin chaahate
 He said that 'these secret hands also want to convert Pakistan into Syria and Iraq
 ’ bilaval ne aagaah kiya ki ‘vah din dur nahin jab taharik e taliban ko dharm ke naam par peshawar main karyaalay kholane kii anumati mil jaaegi
 Bilawal said, "pakistan's future lies only in Bhuttoism and youth ideology
" ’ varsh 2007 main 27 disambar ko rawalpindi ke liyakat baag main ek raajnneetik raily main sambodhan ke turant baad purv pradhanmantri benazir bhutto kii hatya kar di gai thi
 Imran Khan also lashed out at the bilawalppp chief attacked tehreek-e-insaf chief Imran Khan and said that his ongoing protest rallies are also 'part of this secret agenda'
 ’ sindh sarkaar ne shanivaar ko saarvajanik avkaash kii ghoshnaa kii or raily ke liye aadha shahar band rahaa kyonki gahan jaanch ke liye puure shahar main surakshakarmi tainaat the
 Bilawal did his first rally only on 18 October
 
 
 benazir bhutto aath saal ke nirvaasan ke baad 18 oktober 2007 ko pakistan lauti thim or shahrah e faisal main unhen nishaanaa banane ke liye do visphot kiye gaye the
 Political analysts say that Bilawal has taken a fair decision by choosing October 18 as the day for the rally to begin his political career in a big way
 raily ko purv pradhanmantriyon yusuf raja gilaani or or raja parvej ashraf ne bhi sambodhit kiya
 The ruling party PPP of southern Sindh province claimed that around one million people attended the rally

 inputah bhashaa The government, which is preparing to table the Nuclear Liability Bill in Parliament today, was seen trying to persuade the Left parties by indicating that it might consider removing the controversial proposal regarding supplier liability
 sarkaar kii ore se yah sanket mila he ki vah is prastaav main zikr kiye gaye shabd ‘iradatan’ ko hataane ke khilaaf nahin rah sakati he
 It is noteworthy that BJP and Left parties have strongly opposed this proposal

 The BJP argues that it will be very difficult to prove that someone has done any work intentionally or irresponsibly
 sarkaar or vipakshi partiyon main jari gatirodh ke bich audyogic ikaayiyon ne pradhanmantri manmohan singh se apil kar yah kaha he ki aapurtikarta ke daayitv ke bare main koi bhi sakht praavdhaan asainya parmaanu kshetra ke prasar ke prayaason kii disha main avrodh hoga

 chavaan ne vam dalon ke vichaaron par gaur karne kaa vaada kiya, lekin vam dalon ne vidheyak kaa antim masauda padhe jane tak iske samarthan ke liye koi vaada karne se inkaar kar diya he
 CPI (M) Polit Bureau member Sitaram Yechury told reporters here that Minister of State for Science and Technology Prithviraj Chavan made the offer during an hour-long interaction
 yechuri ne kaha, ‘lagata he mantri hamaare drushtikon, khaskar aapurtikartaaon ke daayitv ke bare main hamaari baat sunne ko taiyaar hai
 But to be sure, we have to look at the final draft of the Bill
 ’ unhone bataaya ki chavaan ne vam dalon se kaha he ki vidheyak par sansad main charchaa ke dauraan ve sambandhit sanshodhan pesh karen
 The Left parties say that the proposed bill by the government is not only contrary to some important recommendations given by the Parliamentary Standing Committee, but it has further enhanced the protection of foreign and domestic private suppliers of nuclear materials
 bhaajapa ne kaha ki parmaanu daayitv vidheyak ke sambandh main apni aapattiyon se vah sarkaar ko avgat kara chuki he or ab use is baat kaa intazaar he ki samprag shashan vidheyak ko sansad main rakhe jane par us bare main kya ravaiya apanaataa he
 He said that the party will decide its stand on the attitude of the government
 party pravaktaa rajeev pratap rudi ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘parmaanu daayitv vidheyak ke bare main vigyaan evam praudyogiki rajya mantri prithviraj chavaan or rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ke bich hui baatcheet main party apana ruukh spasht kar chuki he
 Now we will wait for the government's stand
 dekhen, hamaari aapattiyon par uskaa kya kahana he or usee par ham sansad main apana ruukh tay karenge
 Jaitley is said to have told the government to put the same draft of the bill in Parliament, which was recommended by a parliamentary committee considering it

 yadi pakistan kii harakatein isi tarah jari raheen to ham duusare vikalpon ke bare main soch sakate hai
 Air Chief Air Chief Marshal NK Brown said that Pakistan needed to honor the loc and the ceasefire agreement
 aisa nahin karne par hamaare liye duusare vikalp khule hai

 bataa den ki 2018 ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle bhi kesiar ne apni satta ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye rajashyamla yajna karaayaa tha
 Earlier, just before the 2015 assembly elections, KCR had organized Ayut Chandi Mahayagya after spending Rs 15 crore
 unke karibiyon ke mutabik aayut chandi yajna kii vajah se kesiar telugana main saadhe chaar saal tak safaltaapurvak shashan kar sake or vidhansabha chunaav main dobaaraa jabardast jeet hasil kar sake hai
 This time along with KCR Sahasra Chandi Mahayagya, he is also doing Rudra Mahayagya to please Shiva
 kesiar jyotish, ankashastra or vaastu main gaharaa vishwaas rakhte hai
 Not only this, he is known to run the government on the basis of Muhurta

 yah baat charchaa kaa vishay bani hui he
 Let me tell you that the BJP has been saying that the Congress did nothing during its 60-year tenure, then the Congress organized this expansion exhibition to tell and show the BJP
 yojit kiye gaye is kaarykram main khud congress par hi sawaal khadey hone lage, kya congress apane netaaon kaa sammaan karnaa nahin jaanati? Every single character in Aamir Khan's film Lagaan ruled the hearts of people
 inhen main se ek kirdaar tha ishwar kaaka kaa, jise shreevallabh vyas ne nibhaayaa tha
 Srivallabh Vyas was paralyzed 8 years ago
 yahi nahin saal 2013 main parivaar ko aarthik tangi or ilaaj ke chalate jeselmer se jodhpur shift kiya gaya tha
 According to his wife Shobha Vyas, with Aamir at the last moment, the Cine and Television Association at that time did not help him at all
 aamir khan ne hamaari aarthik rup se bahut madad kii
 With his help, we are staying on rent in a 3 bedroom house in Jaipur
 aamir meri betiyon kii skool fees or shreevallabh kaa medical kharch bhi dete the
 In 2008, apart from a severe head injury, actors Emraan Khan and Manoj Vajpayee also helped Srivallabh Vyas a lot in this difficult time
 haalanki ab tak rajya sarkaar or kala jagat ne unki koi sud nahin lee he
 Significantly, in October 2008, Srivallabh fell in the bathroom of a hotel during the shooting of a Bhojpuri film in Rajpipla, Gujarat
 sir main gahari chot kii vajah se vah behosh ho gaye the
 Soon after the accident, crew members took him to Vadodara
 vahaan ke ek hospital main unke sir kaa oparation kiya gaya
 After the operation, doctors said he was out of danger
 actor kii patni shobhaa shreevallabh vyas ke mutabik beemaari ke kaaran unhen do saal main teen ghar badalane pade
 According to Shobha, people say, the sick person is with us, we cannot keep up

 After the recently concluded five state assembly elections including Uttar Pradesh, the challenge has been to present a balanced budget for the UPA government under changed circumstances
 ek taraf badhata rajkoshiya ghaataa, dhimi padati aarthik vruddhi, mahangaai or badhati sabsidi kii kathin chunautiyaan hai to duusari taraf aam aadmi or naukari pesha varg sasta anaaj, sasta petrol, dijal or iskar daron main zyada riyaayaten milane kii ummid lagaaye baitha he
 Economic experts say that the Finance Minister will have to make every effort to reduce the fiscal deficit
 iske liye vah utpaada evam sevakar kii daron main vruddhi kar inhen vaishvik mandi shuru hone se pehle kii sthiti main laa sakate hai
 The finance minister will have to reduce the subsidy on diesel, cooking gas and fertilizer by increasing the prices of them
 iske alaava bijli or koyala kshetron main adchanon ko dur karne kii bhi zarurat he taaki audyogic utpaadan ko phir se patari par laayaa ja sake
 The industry also has high expectations from the Finance Minister
 udyog jagat chahta he ki company kar beshak 30-32 pratishat par bana rahe lekin utpaada evam sevakar daron main vruddhi nahin honi chaiye
 Depreciation rates on plant and machinery should be increased and investment incentives for companies should be resumed
 udyog jagat tel evam gas kshetra main nivesh badhaane ke liye or bhi kai tarah kii riyaayaten chahta he
 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth during the year was presented by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee in the Budget for 2011-12 in February last year
 75 se lekar 9
 It was estimated to be in the range of 25 percent
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe ummid he ki agle saal ausat mudrasphiti kam rahegi or chaalu khate kaa ghaataa kam rahegaa jise behatar gharelu bachat or sthaayee puunji pravaah se thik se vyavasthit kar liya jaayegaa
 Now that the end of the financial year is nearing, according to the expressed estimates, the 2011-12 economic growth will be around seven per cent and inflation will be at a high of seven per cent by the end of March
 varsh ke dauraan sarkaar kaa rajkoshiya ghaataa 4
 The budget was estimated to be 6 percent but now its 5
 5 pratishat rahane ke anumaan vyakt kiye ja rahe hai
 The government's direct and indirect tax collection is also being underestimated by the budget estimate
 visheshgyon ke anusaar sabase zyada samasya sabsidi ke morche par khadi hui he
 Imports became expensive due to the steep fall in the rupee against the dollar
 isse urvarak or petroleum padaarthon kaa aayaat kharch bad gaya
 The budget estimate for fertilizer and petroleum subsidies increased by more than Rs 1 lakh crore
 isse rajkoshiya ghate par baari dabaav bad gaya
 This left the government's effort for fiscal consolidation down

 in dinon goa main antarrashtriya film mahotsav kii dhooma hua karti he
 The Inox Theater takes place behind the Arts Academy and the old Medical College on the banks of Mandvi
 filmon ke bich thodi chuttee lekar logabagh mandavi ke tat par tahal aate hai
 The more enthusiastic people also visit the Dudhsagar waterfall
 dudhsagar jalprapaat par hi mandavi nadi thodaa thaharti he or aage badhati he
 Dudhsagar means ocean of milk
 is naam ke peeche bhi ek dilachasp kissa he
 Long ago, there used to be a lake in the middle of the Western Ghats where a princess came to bathe daily with her friends
 snaan ke baad rajkumaari gadaa bhar doodh piya karti thi
 One day while she was out in the lake, a young man going from there noticed her and the young man stopped there and started seeing the princess bathing
 apni laaj rakhane ke liye rajkumaari kii sakhiyon ne doodh kaa gadaa jhil main udel diya taaki doodh kii parat ke peeche ve khud ko chupa saken
 It is said that since then the milky water of this waterfall is flowing continuously
 par ab yah dudhia pani laal rang pakadaney laga he
 Iron ore has started tying Mandvi in chains
 louh ayask kaa laal rang mandavi ke pani ko badnuma laal rang main badalane laga he
 The Mandvi river, also known as Mandovi, Mahadayi or Mahadei or in some places the Gomti River, originally flows in Karnataka and Goa
 govavale to isko goa kii jivan rekha bhi kehete hai
 Mandvi and Zuari are the two major rivers of Goa
 lambaai ke lihaaj se mandavi nadi bahut prabhaavshaalee nahin kahi ja sakati
 The total length of the river itself is 77 km and out of which 29 km flows through Karnataka and 52 km from Goa, if you compare it with the rivers of North India, this length is not very special
 par vyapaarik or nauvahan kii drushti se yah desh kii sabase mahatvapurn nadiyon main se ek he or yah isaki takat bhi he or kamajori bhi
 The river originates from a group of thirty springs in the Western Ghats at Bhimgarh in Belgaum district, Karnataka
 nadi kaa jalgrahan kshetra, karnataka main 2,032 varg kimi or goa main 1,580 varg kimi kaa he
 Dudhsagar Falls and Vajrapoha Falls are part of Mandvi
 goa main khanijon main louh ayask sabase mahatvapurn hai or rajya ke rajasav kaa bada hissaa bhi
 But the silt of iron ore has breathed both the major rivers of the state
 goa kii nadiyon par hue ek haalia adhyayan kahata he ki louh ayask kii gaad se donon nadiyaan din-ba-din uthali hoti ja rahi hai
 And this has started to affect aquatic life in the bottom of rivers
 goa vishvavidhyalay ke sagar vigyaan vibhaag ke ek adhyayan main baat saamne ai he ki rajya kii bicholim louh or maiganej ke ayskon kii vajah se behad pradooshit he vahiin mandavi nadi ke pradooshkon main mul rup se louh or sisa (lead) hai
 Bicholim flows in the North Goa district and is a tributary of Mandvi
 is adhyayan main is baat par chintaa jataai gai he ki dakshini goa jile main bahane vaali juaari nadi or uske nadimukh (eschuary) par bhi dhatvik pradooshan kaa asar hoga
 The mineral industry in Goa is almost five decades old and was banned in March 2018 when the Supreme Court rejected the renewal of the leases of 88 iron ore mines
 goa vishvavidhyalay ke shodharthiyon sinthia gonkar or vishnu matta ne goa kii nadiyon or uski tali ke paaritantr par khanan ke asar or juaari nadi kii eschuary (jahaan nadi samudr main milti he) par dhatvik pradooshan ke bare main adhyayan kiya he
 The study has been published in the Research Journal Environment and Earth Sciences and states that pollution has increased due to the rapid mining in North Goa
 is main goa kii teen nadiyon bicholim, mandavi or terekhol se namoonay liye gaye tha
 According to the study, lead and chromium pollution along with iron and manganese in the Bicholim River is widespread
 inamen se sisa or chromium baari dhaatu mana jaataa he or iske asar se cancer kaa khatra hota he
 While there is pollution of manganese and lead in Mandvi river
 terekhol nadi (jo haal tak pradooshan se puri tarah mukt thi) main tambe or chromium (yah bhi khatarnaak he) jaise dhaatuon kii baari maatra maujuud he
 It is worth noting that in these rivers, ores are transported on a large scale by ships and due to this the ores keep falling in the river
 khule khadaanon se barish main ghulkar ayskon kaa malba bhi aakar nadiyon main jamaa hota he
 This has led to silt deposition in the bottom of the rivers and has caused heavy damage to the aquatic organisms that live near or at the bottom
 adhyayan ke mutabik, juaari nadi ke pani main tres metels (sookshm dhaatuon) kii maatra khanan ke dinon ke mukaable khanan par bandish ke dauraan main kaaphi kam rahi hai
 It is clear that this pollution is due to mining
 mandavi par goa ke log uth khadey hue hai
 The government has also been activated and the National Green Authority has also given orders
 koshish yahi honi chahie ki mandavi kaa jal gaad main jakad na jaae or dudhsagar prapaat kaa jal dudhia hi rahe, gandala laal na ho jaae

 The Supreme Court may have given power to the Arvind Kejriwal government in its decision, but the matter is still stuck regarding transfer posting
 ab is par centre sarkaar kaa kahana he ki dilli sarkaar ke paas abhi bhi transfar posting karne kaa haq nahin he
 If the sources of the central government are to be believed, then the Supreme Court in its decision has once again emphasized article 239
 centre kaa kahana he ki centre shasit pradesh ko lekar abhi bhi chizein alag hi hai
 The Center says that the Supreme Court has clearly stated in its decision that three issues (police, law and order, land) will remain with the Lieutenant Governor, while in other cases the LG will have to act on the advice of the Delhi government, where there will be a screw If it is, then he can send the matter to the President
 vahiin in teen maamalon ke alaava koi anya shaktiyon main transfar posting kii power nahin he
 The central government says that full state governments have their own cadre but this is not the case with Delhi
 udhaaharan ke taur par uttar pradesh ke paas apana cader he isliye vahaan ke siem transfar kar sakate hai
 But Delhi does not have its own cadre, all union territories have the same cadre
 isliye dilli sarkaar is par haq nahin jamaa sakati he
 If this happens, how can the Delhi government decide which officer will go where

 iske alaava supreme court ne saaf kar diya he ki dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja milanaa mumkin nahin he
 It is clear from the decision of the Supreme Court that the elected government of Delhi is responsible for running the state
